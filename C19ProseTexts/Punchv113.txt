O more beautiful day could have been imagined, and no more beautiful scene. It was mid-winter in Montreal. The
bright sun was gleaming upon the magnificent Ice-Palace in which King FROST held his Court. The lofty towers,
the gorgeous battlements, and the spacious arches sparkled and glittered with rainbow hues. Through the crisp, clear
air sounded the tinkle of the sleigh-bells and the keen, whirring song of thousands of skates tracing fantastic figures on
the hard, black ice. All that Montreal could show of beauty, of grace, of fashion was gathered there, and over all a
bright spirit of delight held sway.
But from this gay and rejoicing crowd two figures stood apart, not moodily, but in kindly contemplation.
One was short in stature, yet majestic. His eyes, surmounted by shaggy eyebrows, shone with a strange light.
His nose and chin, longer and more pointedly curved, perhaps, than mere ideas of classical beauty might warrant, beamed
back a rosy welcome to the frost. He was clad in a fur coat, and from the centre of his back projected But why
describe him further? It was PUNCH, the Sage, the friend of mankind
“A pretty scene, Sir WILFRID,” he was saying to his companion, a man of an alert face, such as belongs properly
to men of thought and action, “a pretty scene ! At home we cannot rival you in this, Imagine an Ice-Palace in our
London. Why, the soot would lie thick on it before an hour was past, and the fog would hide it from our view.”
“Yet there are compensations,” replied his companion. “Have I not myself seen your crowds on a day in June
assembled to do homage to their QUEEN ? And, as they shouted for their Colonial brothers and friends, did I not feel the
larger spirit of our common patriotism stir within my breast ! For we are all brothers, though differing in race; sons of
one great mother, though parted by

“You speak the truth, as you always do, but—”
“I know what you would say. It was not always so. No mortal is invariably wise. We have had our follies.
Would they had always ended as well as in Canada. Sometimes we have forgotten that you and yours have a natural

(A Horrible Tale of the Fate of a Fashionable
Philistine in the Art Season. A long way
after Kipling.)
A CHAP there was, and he went to stare
(Even as you and II),
At technique and tone, and some whispy

This fool was “in it,” and so he went

And the modish bonds he banned,
When he went with the crowd who didn't

This fool was filled with a foolish pride
Though he yawned a yawn which he
wished to hide,
For the “Vampire” sorely his patience
tried;
And he stared, and dawdled, and nearly

DARBY JONES ON RACING IN GENERAL.
HoNourED SIR,-At a time when Ame-
rican millionaires are making fabulous bids
in “greenbacks” for that splendid son of
Erin, the Diamond Jubilee Derby Winner,
Galtee More, when that gallant little crock,
Victor Wild, has once more covered him-
self with glory at Kempton Park, and
when Lord RoseBERY has been consoled by
the triumph of Velasquez at Newmarket, it
may seem presumption on my part to refer
to the prettiest and most select meeting in
Great Britain. I refer, of course, to Stock-
bridge, where the Bibury Club meets in
full force, and hard by one of the best trout
streams of England, where the fly-fisher
is as well-known as is the flat-catcher at
psom.
Stockbridge is not, of course, Goodwood.
There is nothing Ducal about the arrange-
liveries, or birdless groves, or female cos-
tumes calculated to make husbands think
of Official Receivers, but there is a sort of
“Far-from-the-madding-crowd " Peace,
which would, I verily believe, cause the
Aggravated Grandmother League to recog-
nise that the merry dance of the Turf is
not always tuned to the coarse bawl of the
Bookmaker. In short, honoured Sir, at
Stockbridge, even if you are not a
Bibury-ite,
§". may enjoy one of those
old-fashioned meetings, which remind one
of the sporting prints in which the Prince
Regent, Colonel GEoRGE HANGER, CHIF-
NEY, and bob-tailed nags figure with such
effect.
And now for that little distich, which is
so valued by the followers of the sport of
Kings, Princes of Wales, and even Prime
Ministers. The little bird on the tree
sings:–
Beware, oh! beware
Of the pride of Kingsclere,
And look for the horse with a man on,
That fitly will go
At the pace that we know
Like a ball from the mouth of a cannon.
Leaving you and my honoured patrons
to decipher the rebus, in all confidence
that we shall be so many slayers of the
golden oeuf (or oof) bird,
I am, Your devoted henchman
and practical adviser,

[Mrs. OLIPHANT, the gifted woman of letters,
passed away on Friday, June 25, 1897.]
THE brave, long life at last is done !
No more her pen shall tell with grace
The stories that—each one by one—
Strengthened the writer's pride of place.
Not hers the art of painting #.
Or weaving plot for tragic end.
She limned Romance with pure delight,
And so made all the world her friend.
She had the knowledge of the lives
We find in English womanhood;
And showed that maidens, sweethearts,
wives,
Had hearts of gold for England's good.
Not here to sing her noble aim
While working as a self-made slave;
Only in honour of her name
We place this leaf upon her gravel
G0NFESSIONS OF A JUBILEE POLE.
YEs: it is quite true. I was used for the
CzAR's coronation; and before that I as-
sisted at a function in Persia; and before
that I was in India. And before that—well,
my memory fails me. But ever since I left
my native forest I have been on the road.
You see, I am put up in the streets, and
then covered with red cloth. Then they
hang a banner to me. Of course, the device
on the banner depends upon the country
and the occasion. The other day I was all
Royal Standards, but at my last resting-
lace I_absolutely shone with Imperial
#. It all comes in the day's work. And
I don't mind! Then they tie paper gar-
lands to me. Some of these are on the
road like myself. See that the decorations
of St. James's Street have been bought
(second hand) to freshen up Birmingham,
Rather suggestive of Brum, isn’t it? And
do I like my work? Why, yes. It’s excit-
ing, if it’s nothing else. There's the
utting up and the pulling down, and the
uss of the function itself. I look rather
a sight towards the close. So I ought, after
such dissipation. You can't be out night
after night in an atmosphere of crowd and
hammering without losing something of
your freshness. And then the language
that reaches you! But the Colonials and
the Indians were first-rate, and I had
generally a good time of it. The
Foreign Princes” are old friends of mine.
I am always running across them. Yes; I
am sure to see them again. Probably at
the next State function. They travel about
as much as I do myself. And where am I
going to next? I am sure I don't know.
If you really want to learn, you had better
ask my contractor.
At the Naval Review.
French Visitor (to English Host). Mon
Dieu! what a nombere of your sheeps 'ave
got French names'
English Host (anrious to be pleasant).
Yes! You see, there was a time when—
ahem l—we had to borrow some vessels
from your country. We hadn't got enough
of our own.
[French Visitor is delighted at this proof of
English sympathy.
AFTER THE SPITHEAD DEMONSTRATION.
(Suggested by a South Wales Lady.)
OUT of the valleys of the Deep
That lie between the Mountain waves,
There comes the phantom spirit Sleep,
To make all folk her grateful slaves.
Sweet, kindly Sleep! denied to me
When looking on this lace-like foam,
For on this great and godlike sea
My heart awakes with dawn of Home.
Home! Yes, our Home is far around,
Each rippled crest is all our own. |
Where can such Home be elsewhere found?
What Monarch owns so grand a Throne P
The Sea is England's Let them brag
The Armies of the great Un-free,
But underneath the British flag
The Home of Freedom is the Seal
A Most Trying Situation.
Mr. Chortlebury (who has met a couple of
friends, and invited them to his house to have
a drink). Good heavens ! my wife has gone
out with the key of the tantalus!
[And the parlour-maid grinned consider-
ably when Mr. C. had to send to the
nearest public-house for whiskey.
After the Jubilee.
Robinson (to Jobbinson). What have you
been doing since I saw you last P
Jobbinson. Buying up all the stands I
can for winter fuel. I sha’n’t be able to
afford coals.

O more beautiful day could have been imagined, and no more beautiful scene. It was mid-winter in Montreal. The
bright sun was gleaming upon the magnificent Ice-Palace in which King FROST held his Court. The lofty towers,
the gorgeous battlements, and the spacious arches sparkled and glittered with rainbow hues. Through the crisp, clear
air sounded the tinkle of the sleigh-bells and the keen, whirring song of thousands of skates tracing fantastic figures on

bright spirit of delight held sway.
But from this gay and rejoicing crowd two figures stood apart, not moodily, but in kindly contemplation.
One was short in stature, yet majestic. His eyes, surmounted by shaggy eyebrows, shone with a strange light.

the hard, black ice. All that Montreal could show of beauty, of grace, of fashion was gathered there, and over all a
bright spirit of delight held sway.
But from this gay and rejoicing crowd two figures stood apart, not moodily, but in kindly contemplation.
One was short in stature, yet majestic. His eyes, surmounted by shaggy eyebrows, shone with a strange light.
His nose and chin, longer and more pointedly curved, perhaps, than mere ideas of classical beauty might warrant, beamed
back a rosy welcome to the frost. He was clad in a fur coat, and from the centre of his back projected But why
describe him further? It was PUNCH, the Sage, the friend of mankind
“A pretty scene, Sir WILFRID,” he was saying to his companion, a man of an alert face, such as belongs properly
to men of thought and action, “a pretty scene ! At home we cannot rival you in this. Imagine an Ice-Palace in our
London. Why, the soot would lie thick on it before an hour was past, and the fog would hide it from our view.”
“Yet there are compensations,” replied his companion. “Have I not myself seen your crowds on a day in June
assembled to do homage to their QUEEN ? And, as they shouted for their Colonial brothers and friends, did I not feel the
larger spirit of our common patriotism stir within my breast? For we are all brothers, though differing in race; sons of
one great mother, though parted by
- “The unplumbed, salt, estranging sea.'

“You yourself, Sir,” retorted the Sage, “are one of the glories of our brotherhood. A Frenchman in name and
in race, have you not shown in your own person how wisdom and freedom may avail to bind men together in one citizen-
ship ! Our ancestors sprang at one another's throats. Their descendants work together in peace and harmony for the


























good of their country.”

(A Horrible Tale of the Fate of a Fashionable
Philistine in the Art Season. A long way

A CHAP there was, and he went to stare
(Even as you and II),
At technique and tone, and some whispy

What they meant he knew not, nor did he

This fool was “in it,” and so he went

To stare at scarecrows of cryptic intent

But a fellow must follow the fashion's bent
(Even as you and Il).
“Oh! the toil he lost, and the moil he lost,
And the modish bonds he banned,
When he went with the crowd who didn't
know why

DARBY JONES ON RAGING IN GENERAL.
HoNourED SIR,-At a time when Ame-
rican millionaires are making fabulous bids
in “greenbacks” for that splendid son of
Erin, the Diamond Jubilee §. Winner,
Galtee More, when that gallant little crock,
Victor, Wild, has once more covered him-
self with glory at Kempton Park, and
when Lord RoseBERY has been consoled by
the triumph of Velasquez at Newmarket, it
may seem presumption on my part to refer
to the prettiest and most select meeting in
Great Britain. I refer, of course, to Stock-
bridge, where the Bibury Club meets in
full force, and hard by one of the best trout
streams of England, where the fly-fisher
is as well-known as is the flat-catcher at
Epsom.
Stockbridge is not, of course, Goodwood.
There is nothing Ducal about the arrange-
liveries, or birdless groves, or female cos-
tumes calculated to make husbands think
of Official Receivers, but there is a sort of
“ Far-from-the-madding-crowd " Peace,
which would, I verily believe, cause the
Aggravated Grandmother League to recog-
nise that the merry dance of the Turf is
not always tuned to the coarse bawl of the
Boo er. In short, honoured Sir, at
Stockbridge, even if you are not a
Bibury-ite, you may enjoy one of those
old-fashioned meetings, which remind one
of the sporting prints in which the Prince
Regent, Colonel GEoRGE HANGER, CHIF-
NEy, and bob-tailed nags figure with such
effect.
And now for that little distich, which is
so valued by the followers of the sport of
Kings, Princes of Wales, and even Prime
Ministers. The little bird on the tree
sings : —
Beware, oh! beware
Of the pride of Kingsclere,
And look for the horse with a man on,
That fitly will go
At the pace that we know
Like a ball from the mouth of a cannon.
Leaving you and my honoured patrons
to decipher the rebus, in all confidence
that we shall be so many slayers of the
golden oeuf (or oof) bird,

and practical adviser,

SIR, IMMEDIATEly 'M–LET 's SEE–A GLAss of MILR, SIR,

DINNERS AND DINERS.
(With Apologies to the P-ll M-ll G-z-tte.)
It had been my good fortune to give to Mademoiselle FaustiNE,
*Sharming little actress, a tip for the Welter Plate last Spring.
What more natural than that I should ask her to give me a din-
ner as some slight return? She readily accepted, and asked me
to name the day. Glancing at the sixth volume of my engage-
ment book, I found my first vacant date was June 18, '97. #.
was fortunate, as it is hardly possible—except at VoIsiN's—to
get a decent dinner unless you order it a year in advance.
Where shall we dine?” asked FaustiNE.
... “There is only one place where people do dine,” I answered, a
little reproachfully. “The Bon .. I will order the dinner.”
So the place and the date were fixed.
+ + + + - -
. As FaustiNE was a quarter of an hour late—I had not seen her
since our arrangement—I waited in the alabaster portico of the
Bon Marché, chatting amiably to the courteous commissionaire,
an old comrade of mine in the Wimbledon days. Jules, the
courteous chef, was au désespoir. Why had I not given him more
notice? Madame was fifteen minutes late. If he had only
known! In a year and fifteen minutes it is possible to cook a
dinner. In a year—no. I tried to calm the worthy fellow—an
old ally of mine in the Crimean war. In vain; he complained the
sardines were spoiling. So I went into the dining-room, nodding
courteously to eight princes of the blood, neither of whom ap-
peared, for the moment, to recognise me.
As I seated myself, the entire staff, headed by a brass band,
brought me my Sardines à l’huile. These are a specialité of the
house, and are never—should never be, at least—eaten with the
tim. The Potage à la potasse was quite excellent. I congratu-
lated the courteous chef, pointing out to him the desirability of
mixing, sometimes, a little anti-pyrine into the potassium—both
drugs far too rarely used in modern cookery. Then came the
lutely reservée for my own use. . As I had engaged the entire
staff of waiters, a crown prince, who was entertaining one of our
...; bicyclists, rose to leave, with his guest. I smiled and
nodded to them as they passed, which appeared to hasten their
departure.
he Moulin a vent was delicious, but the Dindon décousu I
could not pass. No self-respecting gourmet will pass everything
at a dinner.
GoNTRAN, the kindly maître d'hôtel, was almost in tears, but I
consoled him by observing that the ostriches were cooked to a
turn, and the Bombe glacée à l'anarchiste faultless.
But my hostess P. Where was she P. Where was Mademoiselle
FAUSTINEP I had quite forgotten her | I beckoned to HAGEN-
Bock, the Press representative of the restaurant, who informed
me she had been dead eight months l I, who read nothing but
menus, had omitted to notice this in the papers. I was greatly
pained. The shock unnerved me—I could eat no more. Besides,
who was now to pay the bill?
I reproduce the bill.
Couverts, £5. , Diners, £36 8s. Champagne, £47.
Liqueurs, 15s. Addition, 3s.
all, £89 8s.-(This is one of the few restaurants where a
charge is made for the addition.)
“Make out the bill,” said I, “in francs, and send it to the
executors of Mademoiselle FAUSTINE.”
II.
Monsieur VICTOR DE TRAIN-DE-Luxe is in many respects a de-
lightful person. In other ways he is not. For instance, because
he was, accidentally, the cause of my backing a winner at Ascot
(simply by means of ordinary stable information), he had the
bad taste to suggest that I should stand him a dinner;
I said, “Certainly, my dear Comte.” (Comte being the courtesy
title I invariably give to foreigners from whom I É. the hope
of borrowing money).
“Where shall it be?”
“There is only one place where one can dine,” I said.
“Of course—the Bon Marché,” he replied.
“No,” I answered. “No, mon ami. If you wish to eat a
really characteristic English dinner, come to the Vegetarian Res-
taurant in Edgware Road. Come along. Come, now!”
“But it's only six o'clock. I am not hungry.”
“All the better,” I replied. And I also pointed out to him that
the best way to see *...ºn is outside an omnibus. So we
started.
Pain, 2s.
- - - - -
Arrived at the restaurant, I was enthusiastically received by
the courteous cashier, who presented me with a previous bill,
which, I noticed, had not been receipted. I said I thought it
rather rude to present a gentleman with a bill which they n’t
taken the trouble to receipt.
We sat down.
“I’m glad,” I said to WIoToR, “that I didn't know this dinner
was coming off to-day. If I had had notice, I might have ordered
it beforehand; and a dinner, to be perfection, should be eaten, if
possible, on the day it is cooked. At least, that’s what i always
think. I may be wrong.”
Monsieur DE TRAIN-DE-LUXE smiled, said I was a farceur, and
I ordered our dinner.
First, some turnip turtle soup, then, ortolans of spinach and
mashed potatoes, followed by a canvas-backed duck made of
Indian corn, and last, not least, plum-pudding. As all will agree,
this makes a very delicious and seasonable repast. Long dinners
have quite gone out of fashion. And this was washed down with
a sparkling bottle of Orange Champagne, '97.
My friend Victor, who is rather a gourmet, was so struck with
the first mouthful of soup, that he said it was quite enough, ob-
serving, he had never tasted anything like it.
Pleased with this praise, I asked his opinion of the ortolans.
He said that their aroma dispensed with the necessity for their
consumption. He was evidently surprised.
When the bill was presented by the courteous “chucker-out,”
we found that most unluckily neither of us had any money.
I append the bill.
Dinners (for two), 1s. 9d. Champagne, 3d. Total, 2s.
To this I ought really to add:—
Cab (for three) to Marylebone Police Court, 1s. 6d. (The con-
stable refused to walk without us.)

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday.—A considerable number of those who had been
Jubileeing at the Royal Garden Party, and who had yet to finish
the day at the great reception of the Colonials, given by Sir
HENRY IRVING, at the Lyceum, have made a hurried dinner—or
rather, taken a mere snack—and have rushed to Covent
Garden to hear Madame MELBA as Marguerite, Monsieur ALvaREz
as Faust, with Signor ANconA as Valentine, Madame BRAzzI as
Siebel, and the semper utile-dulci BAUERMEISTER-singer as Martha,
in Gounod's Faust. A first-rate cast. Apology made for
the state of M. PLANcon's throat, but apparently it was need-
less, since, as Mephistopheles, he sang as well as ever, and acted
better. Madame 'Mºſooks the German Gretchen, who was of
course a rather stolid kind of young person, not inclined to be
over-emotional, while her singing is perfect, as is also that
of Tenor Alvarez. ... Faust, with an ordinary cast, is not,
nowadays, a great attraction in itself, but to see it with such a
cast as above given, the house is crammed. MELBA's motto is,
“Better late than never,” and that she and Alvarez, with the
others, can, at such a busy time, draw so big a house, may by a
wee bit reduce the compass of the De Rºi. voices, though
any Opera-goer would be sorry to hear that the Big Brothers
should be “singing small.”
Tuesday.—Jubilee reaction setting in. Covent Garden Party
sº by Royal Garden Party, and all the rest of it—precious
little “rest of it” for anyone, especially for H.R.H. the Prince,
pºor house-not very."poor,” however, considering the diamonds
glittering here and there—until end of second act, when house
itself again, or something like it. Madame Saville's Manon is
popular, and Tenor WAN Dyck, in Act IV., came out as strong as a
vocal Samson, and, like that muscular prototype, “brought down
the house,”, only without any injury to himself. No Royalties

DINNERS AND DINERS.
(With Apologies to the P-ll M-ll G-z-tte.)
It had been my good fortune to give to Mademoiselle FAUSTINE,
a charming little actress, a tip for the Welter Plate last Spring.
What more natural than that I should ask her to give me a din-
ner as some slight return? She readily accepted, and asked me
to name the day. Glancing at the sixth volume of my engage-
ment book, I found my first vacant date was June 18, '97. This
was fortunate, as it is hardly possible—except at VoIsIN's—to
get a decent dinner unless you order it a year in advance.
“Where shall we dine?” asked FaustiNE.
... “There is only one place where people do dine,” I answered, a
little reproachfully. “The Bon º I will order the dinner.”
So the place and the date were fixed.
+ + + + - -
. As FaustiNE was a quarter of an hour late—I had not seen her
since ºur arrangement—I waited in the alabaster portico of the
Bon Marché, chatting amiably to the courteous commissionaire,
an old comrade of mine in the Wimbledon days. JULEs, the
courteous chef, was au désespoir. Why had I not given him more
notice? Madame was fifteen minutes late. If he had only
known l In a year and fifteen minutes it is possible to cook a
dinner. In a year—no. I tried to calm the worthy fellow—an
old ally of mine in the Crimean war. In vain; he complained the
sardines were spoiling. So I went into the dining-room, nodding
courteously to eight princes of the blood, neither of whom ap-
peared, for the moment, to recognise me.
As I seated myself, the entire staff, headed by a brass band,
brought me my Sardines à l’huile. These are a specialité of the
house, and are never—should never be, at least—eaten with the
tim. The Potage à la potasse was quite excellent. I congratu-
lated the courteous chef, pointing out to him the desirability of
mixing, sometimes, a little anti-pyrine into the potassium—both
drugs far too rarely used in modern cookery. Then came the
question of wine. This I solved for the moment by ordering two
lutely reservée for my own use. As I had engaged the entire
staff of waiters, a crown prince, who was entertaining one of our
leading bicyclists, rose to leave, with his guest. I smiled and
nodded to them as they passed, which appeared to hasten their
departure.
he Moulin & vent was delicious, but the Dindon décousu I
could not pass. No self-respecting gourmet will pass everything
at a dinner.
GoNTRAN, the kindly maître d'hôtel, was almost in tears, but I
consoled him by observing that the ostriches were cooked to a
turn, and the Bombe glacée à l'anarchiste faultless.
But my hostess P "Where was she P. Where was Mademoiselle
FAUSTINEP I had quite forgotten her! I beckoned to HAGEN-
Bock, the Press representative of the restaurant, who informed
me she had been dead eight months l I, who read nothing but
menus, had omitted to notice this in the papers. I was greatly
pained. The shock unnerved me—I could eat no more. Besides,
who was now to pay the bill?
I reproduce the bill.
Couverts, £5. , Diners, £36 8s. Champagne, £47.
Liqueurs, 15s. Addition, 3s.
}. all, £89 8s.-(This is one of the few restaurants where a
charge is made for the addition.)
“Make out the bill,” said I, “in francs, and send it to the
executors of Mademoiselle FAUSTINE.”
II.
Monsieur WIoToR DE TRAIN-DE-Luxe is in many respects a de-
lightful person. In other ways he is not. For instance, because
he was, accidentally, the cause of my backing a winner at Ascot
(simply by means of ordinary stable information), he had the
bad taste to suggest that I should stand him a dinner;
I said, “Certainly, my dear Comte.” (Comte º courtesy
title I invariably give to foreigners from whom I have the hope
of borrowing money).
“Where shall it be?”
“There is only one place where one can dine,” I said.
“Of course—the Bon Marché,” he replied.
“No,” I answered. “No, mon ami. If you wish to eat a
really characteristic English dinner, come to the Vegetarian Res-
taurant in Edgware Road. Come along. Come, now!”
“But it's only six o'clock. I am not hungry.”
“All the better,” I replied. And I also pointed out to him that
the best way to see *...in is outside an omnibus. So we
started.
Pain, 2s.
Arrived at the restaurant, I was enthusiastically received by
the courteous cashier, who presented me with a previous bill,
which, I noticed, had not been receipted. I said I thought it
rather rude to present a gentleman with a bill which they 't
taken the trouble to receipt.
We sat down.
“I’m glad,” I said to WIoTor, “that I didn't know this dinner
was coming off to-day. If I had had notice, I might have ordered
it beforehand; and a dinner, to be perfection, should be eaten, if
possible, on the day it is cooked. At least, that’s what i always
think. I may be wrong.”
Monsieur DE TRAIN-DE-LUXE smiled, said I was a farceur, and
I ordered our dinner.
First, some turni
mashed potatoes
turtle soup, then, ortolans of spinach and
ollowed by a canvas-backed duck made of
Indian corn, and iast, not least, plum-pudding. As all will agree,
this makes a very delicious and seasonable repast. Long dinners
have quite gone out of fashion. And this was washed down with
a sparkling bottle of Orange Champagne, '97. -
My friend WIoToR, who is rather a gourmet, was so struck with
the first mouthful of soup, that he said it was quite enough, ob-
serving, he had never tasted anything like it.
Pleased with this praise, I asked his opinion of the ortolans.
He said that their aroma dispensed with the necessity for their
consumption. He was evidently surprised.
When the bill was presented by the courteous “chucker-out,”
we found that most unluckily neither of us had any money.
I append the bill.
Dinners (for two), 1s. 9d. Champagne, 3d. Total, 2s.
To this I ought really to add:—
Cab (for three) to Marylebone Police Court, 1s. 6d. (The con-
stable refused to walk without us.)
Loss to reputation by report of proceedings, 8d.

If you took horf your coat and showed your braces.
Didn’t the boys just chivey and yah-boo
You and your mates where'er you showed your faces?

Hantediluvian old himages! But

Where did you git them curious cowslicks cut P-

More like pew-openers than sharp handy coppers.
I know one in a Bethel out at Bow,
With just such kite-tail'd coat and mutton-choppers.

Tells me I look as smart as a swell booky.
Our summer-wear, long promised, keeps us cool:
June perspiration sometimes was a drencher.
All we want now, is to break down that rule
As won't allow us just a modest quencher.
Ah, X, you should ha’ felt that Jubilee thust!
If Mister BERNARD ABRAHAMs gits his way,
And Bobby is allowed to lay his dust
With a cool tankard—then we shall be gay!
OPERATIO NOTES.
Monday.—A considerable number of those who had been
Jubileeing at the Royal Garden Party, and who had yet to finish
the day at the great reception of the Colonials, given by Sir
HENRY IRVING, at the Lyceum, have made a hurried dinner—or
rather, taken a mere snack—and have rushed to Covent
Garden to hear Madame MELBA as Marguerite, Monsieur ALvaREz
as Faust, with Signor ANCONA as Valentine, Madame BRAzzI as
Siebel, and the semper utile-dulci BAUERMEISTER-singer as Martha,
in Gounod's Faust. A first-rate cast. Apology made for
the state of M. PLANcon's throat, but apparently it was need-
less, since, as Mephistopheles, he sang as well as ever, and acted
better. Madame 'Mºiooks the German Gretchen, who was of
course a rather stolid kind of young person, not inclined to be
over-emotional, while her singing is perfect, as is also that
of Tenor ALVAREz. Faust, with an ordinary cast, is not,
nowadays, a great attraction in itself, but to see it with such a
cast as above given, the house is crammed. MELBA's motto is,
“Better late than never,” and that she and ALvAREz, with the
others, can, at such a busy time, draw so big a house, may by a
wee bit reduce the compass of the De Reszkian voices, though
any Opera-goer would be sorry to hear that the Big Brothers
should be “singing small.”
Tuesday.—Jubilee reaction setting in. Covent Garden Party
exhausted by Royal Garden Party, and all the rest of it—precious
little “rest of it” for anyone, especially for H.R.H. the Prince,
pºor house-not very."poor,” however, considering the diamonds
glittering here and there—until end of second act, when house
itself again, or something like it. Madame Saville's Manon is
popular, and Tenor WAN Dyck, in Act IV., came out as strong as a
vocal Samson, and, like that muscular prototype, “brought down
the house,” only without any injury to himself. No oyalties
visible..." Royalties” paid possibly on performance of Opera,
but that's another story, and on we goes again to
Wednesday.—Die Meistersinger at seven l House soon full.
Royalties present. All must have sacrificed a meal to music.
Supper in prospect. NED DE REszKE in fine form; likewise his

brother. Company generally at its best; audience enthusiastic,
and MANOINELLI, “called from the vasty deep” of orchestra
“came when called,” and modestly bowed his inoisiºn: of
compliment. Fine singing, and excellent bit of character-actin

third act, magnificent. WAGNER outwagnered 1 Likewise finale.
Fancy that either this hot weather agrees with “our stout JEAN’”
DE REszKE, who seems to have become a trifle stouter, or the
heat has reduced the rotundity of tºother Meistersingers. Too
hot to consider problem. Think Opera had better have com-
menced at 8.30 and finished at 1 A.M. Also of opinion that
house, applauding so warmly, could have afforded to let itself
be refrigerated just a bit. Decided attraction.
Friday.—New Opera. Made in Germany by WILHELM KIENZL,
and sung, here, in German. There are, in Der Evangelimann, some
charmingly melodious moments, when the ordinary Qpera-goer will
murmur, “O si sic omnia /* whatever there might have been of
real dramatic action in the original plot, as first conceived by its
author, has been ruthlessly j out of it in the course of
construction. There is nothing new in the jealousy felt by the
elder for his younger brother, better favoured by nature, and
more favoured by the lady. The heroine disappears after the
first act!! The elder brother, capitally played and sung by Mr.
DAvid BISPHAM, appears as a sort of German Paul Pry, without
“I hope I don't intrude.” In appearance, the younger brother,
quite an artistic triumph for M. WAN Dyck, calls to mind some
old pictures of “Farmer GEoRGE.” Miss ENGLE, as the Fraulein
Martha, was excellent. No time or space for details. We must

MILITARY MANOEUVRES OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY,
“Cooling His CoPPER.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE republication of CHARLEs LEVER's works, by Messrs.
Down EY & Co., goes merrily on. The latest out is Tom Burke of
Ours, which, if not much of a story, as far as a connected plot
j 1s thrillingly interesting as a clear narrative of the Napo-
eonic campaigns, personally told by an Irish volunteer, who,
after studying at the Polytechnique in the days of the first
Consul, joined the French army, and, with one brief interval,
when Fate for the first time frowned on “the Man of Destiny,’
was with the great Emperor, the tyrannical Corsican, from the
capitulation of Ulm and the overthrow of the Austrian Empire
to the last victory of the French at Montereau, where the rea
heroine of the tale, Minette, the vivandière, dies the death of a
ſº soldier, for which the Baron cannot forgive the author of
er being, as she ought to have lived to be Mrs. Tom Burke—and
thence to the last sad scene of all at Fontainebleau, when “the
Empire was ended; and the Emperor, the mighty genius who
created it, was on his way to exile.” With the restoration of the
Monarchy the story finishes. Even now this book exercises over
me a marvellous charm. The colouring of the historic pictures is
as bright as ever, the style as dashing, and the whole narrative
as absorbing as when first I devoured it, years and years ago, in
my little room at Eton.
If Mr. ToM GALLoN had written Tatterly in time for Messrs.
HUTCHINsoN to publish it before The Cricket on the Hearth
chirped in the ears of a delighted world, it would have had
stupendous success. As it is, §. book lies under the cloud that
broods, needlessly in this case, over the second hand. Mr.
GALLoN recks so little of this that he names his principal charac-
ter by the Christian name of the memorable Caleb Plummer.
But because CHARLEs DICKENs lived and wrote, shall there be no
more cakes and ale? The world is large enough for two good
books, and here is a second. The plot underlying the story of
Tatterly is not new, but the manner in which, at a critical point,
Baronite; in reading it, was struck with its adaptability for the
stage—wherein also it resembles the great original. It is a far
cry from Demetrius, or Svengali to Tatterly. But Mr. BEERBoHM
TREE is an artist to whom nothing is impossible. It might be
worth his while to look up Tatterly, and consider its possibilities
for the stage. In the meanwhile, the reader will find the book
*|†† in its pathos, its humour, and its humanity.
The Natural History volume of The Concise Knowledge Library,
edited by Mr. ALFRED H. MILEs, just issued by HUTCHIN-
son & Co., is a marvel of erudition, condensation, lucidity, and,
not least striking, of cheapness. For five shillings one has
the chance of making the personal acquaintance of the creatures
upon the earth, under the earth, and of those that fly above its
surface. The text, contributed by an imposing array of learned
men, is illustrated by upwards of five hundred original drawings.
On the threshold of the fascinating study, my Baronite was con-
fronted by the difficulty that the English language does not
possess a word of its own that will include all the animals forming
the class known to zoologists as the mammalia. Quadrupeds is some-
times loosely used. But the term excludes man and includes the
turtle. To show how minute is the inquiry, it may be stated that
not less than nineteen different classes of worms are mentioned.
Oddly º: reference to the book-worm is omitted. The
revered head of the family, the erudite Baron himself, is passed
by as if he were not. This is, however, the only omission noted
in eight hundred pages, teeming with interest.
*Did I want to visit the East,” quoth the Baron, “I would take
my Davey, I mean, I should take my RICHARD favºy with me,
represented by his two volumes (CHAPMAN AND HALL) about The
Sultan and his Subjects; the SULTAN now .# become one of
Mr. DAVEY's subjects.” But the Baron is pained by the want of
confidence shown by Mr. DAVEY towards his readers, as, knowing
so much, and having had such unusual advantages, he pauses on
the threshold of the harem, turns round to his reading followers,
and saying, with a wink, “Wait here till I come out,” disappears,
and when he does return, to his anxious inquirers he not a
word to say—not a word—no more than had Bottom, the weaver,
when he came back from the wonders of Fairyland. Now, what
is the use of having the run of a harem or two if you’re to hold
your tongue for ever afterwards? No, Mr. RICHARD COEUR DE

wonder what has become of Colonial Premiers. There are pre-

on the success of the reception—even without the Colonial Pre-

House banquet, and are now being detained by my Lord SALis-

capitulation of Ulm and the overthrow of the Austrian Empire
to the last victory of the French at Montereau, where the rea
heroine of the tale, Minette, the vivandière, dies the death of a
fºllº soldier, for which the Baron cannot forgive the author of
er being, as she ought to have lived to be Mrs. Tom Burke—and
thence to the last sad scene of all at Fontainebleau, when “the
Empire was ended; and the Emperor, the mighty genius who
created it, was on his way to exile.” With the restoration of the
Monarchy the story finishes. Even now this book exercises over
me a marvellous charm. The colouring of the historic pictures is
as bright as ever, the style as dashing, and the whole narrative
as absorbing as when first I devoured it, years and years ago, in
my little room at Eton.
If Mr. ToM GALLoN had written Tatterly in time for Messrs.
HUTCHINson to publish it before The Cricket on the Hearth
chirped in the ears of a delighted world, it would have had
stupendous success. As it is, the book lies under the cloud that
broods, needlessly in this case, over the second hand. Mr.
GALLoN recks so little of this that he names his principal charac-
ter by the Christian name of the memorable Caleb Plummer.
But because CHARLEs DICKENs lived and wrote, shall there be no
more cakes and ale? The world is large enough for two good
books, and here is a second. The plot underlying the story of
Tatterly is not new, but the manner in which, at a critical point,
Baronite, in reading it, was struck with its adaptability for the
stage—wherein also it resembles the great original. It is a far
cry from Demetrius, or Svengali to Tatterly. But Mr. BEERBoHM
TREE is an artist to whom nothing is impossible. It might be
worth his while to look up Tatterly, and consider its possibilities
for the stage. In the meanwhile, the reader will find the book
delightful in its pathos, its humour, and its humanity.
The Natural History volume of The Concise Knowledge Library,
edited by Mr. ALFRED H. MILEs, just issued by HUTCHIN-
son & Co., is a marvel of erudition, condensation, lucidity, and,
not least striking, of cheapness. For five shillings one has
the chance of making the personal acquaintance of the creatures
upon the earth, under the earth, and of those that fly above its
surface. The text, contributed by an imposing array of learned
men, is illustrated by upwards of five hundred original drawings.
On the threshold of the fascinating study, my Baronite was con-
fronted by the difficulty that the English language does not
possess a word of its own that will include all the animals forming
the class known to zoologists as the mammalia. Quadrupeds is some-
times loosely used. But the term excludes man and includes the
turtle. To show how minute is the inquiry, it may be stated that
not less than nineteen different classes of worms are mentioned.
Oddly º: reference to the book-worm is omitted. The
revered head of the family, the erudite Baron himself, is passed
by as if he were not. This is, however, the only omission noted
in eight hundred pages, teeming with interest.
“Did I want to visit the East,” quoth the Baron, “I would take
my Davey, I mean, I should take my RICHARD favºy with me,
represented by his two volumes (CHAPMAN AND HALL) about The
Sultan and his Subjects; the SULTAN now having become one of
Mr. DAVEY's subjects.” But the Baron is pained by the want of
confidence shown by Mr. DAVEY towards his readers, as, knowing
so much, and having had such unusual advantages, he pauses on
the threshold of the harem, turns round to his reading followers,
and saying, with a wink, “Wait here till I come out,” disappears,
and when he does return, to his anxious inquirers he not a
word to say—not a word—no more than had Bottom, the weaver,
when he came back from the wonders of Fairyland. Now, what
is the use of having the run of a harem or two if you’re to hold
your tongue for ever afterwards? No, Mr. RICHARD COEUR DE
LIon DAVEY, you just give us another volume, and speak out!

Royal Academy Soirée at Burlington House last Thursday.
Crowded house. “Here we go up, up, up” the grand staircase,
overcrowded at first, but soon cleared as guests gradually melt
—it was not by any means the hottest night of the season—and
disperse to “do” the pictures and to “do themselves” uncom-
monly well in the refreshment department. President Sir Edward
and Lady Poynter, receiving everyone with hearty courtesy,
wonder what has become of Colonial Premiers. There are pre-
sent gorgeous Indians, magnificent colourists, but no Colonial
Premiers! Then it is reported that they are all dining at the
Mansion House, and that genially hospitable Sir FAUDEL won’t
hear of their leaving the banquet until they’ve “finished the
bottle” and drunk all the toasts.
At 11.30, no Colonials At midnight, “the cry is still they
come,” but haven't yet arrived. “O, where and O where are m
Co-lo-ni-als?” hums the President, who, after shaking hands º
everybody, may now shake hands with himself, in congratulation
on §. success of the reception—even without the Colonial Pre-
miers, who, it appears, were late in .# at the Mansion
House banquet, and are now being detained by my Lord SALis-
BURY's post-prandial eloquence.
Mr. Joseph CHAMBERLAIN has yet a speech to deliver, but he
must keep it in his pocket for another occasion, as the Colonials
can't stand any more just now, and, if they go anywhere, they
are bound for the Academy Soirée at Burlington House.
At this late hour, as long as everyone can intelligibly articulate
* Bri’sh consh'tooshun,” we know, on the authority of LEECH's
picture, that they must be “all right,” and in a fit state, to “join
the ladies.” But whether the Colonial Premiers and their Pre-
mières ever did reach Burlington House this º is unable
to say, having retired from the gay and festive halls of dazzling
light on the stroke of half-past midnight.

with Scotch business. Education first.
Congested districts to follow. Some first-
rate speaking on earlier subject; but de-
bate hopelessly suffered, as debates do
with Ministerial majority of 140, from
inevitableness of cºś. LoRD Advo-
CATE, in charge of Bill, did his best to keep
up flagging spirits. To pass round the
usquebaugh at a particularly dull moment,
or to give a twirl of the pipes when any-
one in the company is seen nidnodding, a
natural impulse. But GRAHAM MURRAY
feels it would shock Southern prejudice.
So when his watchful eye observed signs of
yawning, he handed round a little sum.
“I will not,” he said, at one perilous
juncture, “stop to do the sum myself.
Probably hon. gentlemen will work it out
for themselves as I go along. If eleven-
eighteenths of £44,000 shew us where Scot-
land stands under this Bill, where will Eng-
land be supposing, instead of sticking to
the 17s.6d. limit, you take the proportion
of 11 to 80, and give Scotland 21 instead
of 11 ?”
That may not convey anything definite
to the Southern mind. But you should
have seen the Scotch Members figuring it
out on their copies of the orders! Lord
Advocate, watching them out of one
corner of his eye, went on with his speech.
When he saw spirits of audience drooping
again, handed round another sum.

one time nigger minstrels were novelty at

GRAHAM MURRAY carried his Bill, though,
as CAwMELL-BANNERMAN cannily said, he
was the only Scotch Member on either side
who expressed cordial approval of its prin-
ciples. Business done.—A heap.
Friday.—Rare to find a man endowed
with dual gift of speaking and writing.
Where phenomenon exists, the platform
style is quite distinct from the literary.
An exception in the case of Member for
West Fife. Picking up in reading-room
just now that admirable weekly, The
Speaker, read article entitled “The John-
sonian Legend.” Hadn't got through first
paragraph before I murmured, “BIRRELL.
or Beelzebub.” Turning over page, found
it wasn't Beelzebub. Article reads exactly
like BIRRELL talks; an admirable style,
unique, as all really good styles are, being
as much a part of a man as his nose or his
ears. A. B. is steeped in the spirit, fla-
vour, and colour of eighteenth century
literature, adding to it a certain delight-
fully sly humour, born of Scotch lineage,
tempered by English birth and Bar asso-
ciations.
Business done.—Irish votes

NOTES BY A COUNTRY NATURALIST.
THE PLEASUREs of JULY.
THE fly season has now begun, and bald-
headed people should be provided with the
new patent “catch-'em-alive-ohl” cap.
Earwigs have wakened up, and are very
busy in their invasions on to pillows, which
do not belong to them.
Ants are swarming, and disregard all
attempts to keep them off gravel paths or
out of sculleries.
Moths make a fine display at night.
Sometimes by a dexterous hit an expert
cricketer may hit one to leg off his lamp or
candle.
Snails and slugs take up their summer
quarters on rose bushes, strawberry plants,
lettuces, and those peas which the sparrows
Green fly and black blight are generally
vieing with caterpillars in the destruction
of vegetable life.
Spiders have a knack of dropping on the
human body, but they totally disregard
their naturai prey. Midges are undis-
turbed by tobacco smoke, and bluebottles
and gnats help themselves.
REFLECTIONS ON A BROKEN ENGAGEMENT.
WE parted—cheerfully Yet now
I've fallen into disrepute
With nearly all her friends, who vow
That she’s an angel, I'm a brute;
Black isn’t black enough for me,
My conduct will not bear inspection—
A statement which I hold to be
Fair food for critical reflection.
We parted. The consummate ease
With which “united hearts” can range
From their allegiance, if they please,
But illustrates the laws of change.
The thoughts and tastes of yester year
Fall under Father Time's correction—
This is not critical, I fear,
But platitudinous reflection'
We parted. She had quite a pack
bºis, “nice boys,” as she avowed;
She called them Bob, and Dick, and JACK,
And I was—one amongst the crowd.
I did not, people may infer,
Possess entire her young affection—
Yet, be it understood, on her
f'cast no shadow of reflection!
We parted. Men cannot persist
In playing uncongenial parts—
I was a j philatelist,
Her hobby was collecting—hearts!
A simple case. I did not pine
To add my heart to her collection,
She had no stamps to add to mine,
We parted—wisely, on reflectionſ
A WoxDERFUL LINER. — A New York
aper states that a boat is shortly to be
aunched which will cross the Atlantic in
sixty-five hours. The motive power, is
gasoline. Mr. Punch believes that this

mentary debate. But, as SARK says, at 'have not already consumed.
ought to be spelt “gas o' lying.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Our Poetess. “Do Not TALK to ME of DINNER, Edwin. I Must
STAY BY THIs BEAUTIFUL SEA, AND DRINK IT ALL IN/"
Bill the Boatman. “LoR | SHE's A THIRSTY ONE Too !”
AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
AT THE THEATRE.
DEAR MISTER,-At the month of july when he makes ordi-
narily so hot, we other French we go rarely to the theatre. In
effect during this month here one amuses himself rather where
the windows are all great open, or yet better in a garden in full
air. When one desires even to sleep at the beautiful star, a la
belle étoile, one loves not to be shut in an atmosphere so suffoca-
ting. But at London it is not “autres temps, autres macurs,”
for the other manners are at the same time, and the brave Eng-
lish, mans and womans equally, can to support the atmosphere
of the theatre, calm and correct as at the ...
I admire much your theatres. I go not to pronounce a dis-
course on the artists of the theatre in England. I have seen of
them many—Sir IRVING, Mister HARE, Mister WINDAM, and,
there is some time, him who has the double title, Sir Esquire
BANCKRoft. And the ladys also-Lady TERRY, fady Esquire
BANCKRoFT, Missis PATRICK-CAMBELL, and some others.
Since the feasts of the Jubilee, the number of the spectacles
diminishes. And, thing enough droll, several among them are
not english. When he makes too much hot for to play at Paris,
the french artists come to London, and the other strangers also.
Thus, by example, the English, who study not the stranger
languages as the Russians or the Austrians, can to go to see at
London Missis BERNHARDT, Missis RájANE or Missis ODILoN.
Ah, the charming artist of Vienna, so gay, so admirable ! I am
gone to see her, and I am enchanted. Sometimes also the Lon-
donians can to see Missis DUse, or CoquELIN youngster, without
to speak of the Opera, where some singers, polonish or italian,
sing in french some german operas before the english assistance.
ll lastly I am gone to see the french artists several times. I
know so well the pieces, and I have seen the artists so often, that
I find myself as at me, comme chez moi. But the theatre it is
not the same thing. I have remarked that at the moment of to
arrive, for I encounter not the merchant of programmes at the
entry. It is true that one offers to me a translation of the piece
—to me, what droll of idea! Then at the interior one finds not
three men, installed behind a counter, who have the air of magis-
trates, and after that some openers, ouvreuses, enough old and
enough ugly. Ah no l In England the openers are young and
often pretty, and they are so genteel, gentilles, that one buys
almost volunteerly, volontiers, a miserable programme, covered
of announces, at six pennys. It is not the charming little pro-
gramme of L'Illustration which one receives gratis in the theatres
of Paris, nor the self-saying journal, which one buys at two
pennys; it is all simply a list of the artists, surrounded of re-
clamations, réclames. See there one thing which iadmire not.
In effect all costs more dear than at Paris. An armchair of orches-
tra at ten shillings six pennys is enough dear; at twenty and one,
or even at twenty-five shillings, as at the Opera, it is too much dear.
One time, for to see Missis BERNHARDt at the Adelphi, I pay
twelve shillings six pennys for an armchair of balcony, and I see
not anything, absolutely not anything excepted the heads of the
spectators pushed in before, penchées en avant. There is even
some persons at the last rank who, seeing not anything from their
laces, hold themselves upright ail the time, and pay more than
#. francs for that. It is very bad arranged that balcony there.
It is true that the most part of the theatres are better aerated
than at Paris, that the armchairs of orchestra are more large and
more comfortable, and that the ladys are all in great toilet, so
that the scene is not entirely hidden by a hat of the most gigan-
tics, that which arrives so often at Paris. Truly this part of the
londonian theatres, filled of adorable ladys in robes of evening,
the hairs graciously arranged, and not covered of hats, is abso-
lutely charming to see, and has the air of a flat band, plate-bande,
of flowers. But even for that I love not to pay two times,
almost three times, more dear than at Paris.
Agree, &c., AUGUSTE.
PREMIER PUNCH TO COLONIAL PREMIERS.
[Sir Edward BRApoon, Premier of Tasmania, speaking at a meeting
convened by the British º League, “to welcome the Colonial Premiers
to the City of London,” said “He would leave this country—that was, if he
lived to do so—bitterly disappointed if some steps were not taken to forward
that which would bring the mother country and the colonies closer together.”]
“A Miss is as good as a mile,” it has been said;
But not as good as a (British Empire) League !
To bring Imperial Unity to a head,
Without compulsion as without intrigue,
Is our joint hope, and would we might compute
That “Ce n'est que le ‘ Premier’ pas qui coſite”!
OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday.—Our old friend Les Huguenots. Poor MAGGIE
MACINTYRE ill, and replaced by Mlle. PACARY... Good house.
Good performance. ALWAREzin fineyoice, and Baritone RENAUD,
a name suggestive of gay duellistin Corsican Brothers, excellent as
Comte de Nevers-too-late-to-mend. MARIE ENGLE raised herself
in public opinion by her “Sister MARY JANE's top note” in
the Queen's song, and PLANCON sang con brio as St. Bris. Opera
completed by Mlle. BAUERMEISTER as Dame d'Honneur. But
what character cannot she play with distinction ? Wonderful
BAUERMEISTER-singeress!, Cannot M. FLON, the conductor,
hºly on the operatic omnibus * 0 those “waits” between the
acts ſ Why remind us that “Christmas is coming,” by lugging
in “the Waits” between the acts *
Friday, at 8.—“Original version” of Le Nozze di Figaro, with
EMMA EAMEs, aristocratically charming as La Contessa, and first
appearance here of Mlle. CLEMENTINE DE WERE as Susanne.
CIEMENTINE not remarkable for anything in particular. NED DE
REszKE quite the Count, married and unsettled; ANCONA a
dapper Figaro; CoRs1, a burlesque Basilio; and Dotty Duttore
Bartolo conventionally represented by “Vive Lemprière” PRINGLE."
ZELIE DELUssan, en garçon, a buxom, boyish Cherubino, more like
herself than ever when “disguised” as a girl. And—quite a
novice as Marcellina . guess? . . . Operatic management's
proverb . . . —“When in doubt, play BAUERMEISTER,” . Re-
nowned RANDEGGER conscientiously conducted; and Mr. Dol-
METsch, somewhere down below, accompanied the recitatives on
an ancient harpsichord, whose peculiar sound is rather suggestive
of orchestra having been re-inforced by TINNEY.
Saturday.—New Opera by FREDERIG REGNAL, “first produc-
tion on any stage,”—entitled, Inez Mendo. What “Inez” has
to “Mend-o,” or whether she might be improved and be “ Inez
On-the-Mendo,” this deponent cannot say this week. The Eng-
lish version by W. BEATTY-fied KINGSTON. “Now we sha’n’t
be long,” which is not what we can ever say about the entr'actes
at the Öpera. Observations on Inez reserved till we’ve heard it.

GET Away. From THAT FENCE |
CAN'T You see it HAs just BEEN FRESH PAINTED, You Fool "
THE LAY OF AN OPTIMIST.
“Of all sad words of tongue or pen
The saddest are these—“It might have been.’”
J. G. Whittie R.
THE lady-novelist contrives
A woeful tale and long,
She parts the lovers, spoils their lives,
Makes everything go .
She loves to see the Fates make hay
In endless fits of spleen,
That in the end she gaily may
Bemoan the “might-have-been "!
Love once, it happens, crossed my way,
And bound me with his spell;
I often still recall the day
When I proposed to NELL.
She now possesses children nine,
A tongue and temper keen—
She's Jones's wife, you know, not mine,
To think—she might have been
To Tiny Tim's untimely fate
I also may appeal—
He foolishly evinced of late
A taste for human veal.
The dog, they said, was clearly mad
To bite a calf so lean—
It was not mine, I wish to add,
But still—it might have been
A host of “moving accidents
By flood and field” I’ve known—
I say I've known, since my intent's
To tell the truth alone.
A railway smash is not much fun,
Yet-do not think I mean
That I have ever been in one,
But that I might have been
There may be pathos, one admits,
In “might-have-been" sometimes,
Although it's not a rule which fits
The cases in my rhymes.
And 'spite the lady-novelist,
Some comfort I can glean—
There's nothing sad in having missed
Some things which might have been
HINTS FOR HENIEY.
(At the Service of Visitors wishing to be
comfortable.)
TAKE care to be invited to the best
situated house-boat.
If you can, get permission to ask a few
friends to join your host's party at
luncheon.
Be sure to secure the pleasantest seat,
the most amusing neighbour, and all the
periodicals.
If you are conversationally inclined,
monopolize the talk, and if you are not,
plead a headache for keeping every one
silent.
Mind that “No. 1" is your particular
numerical distinction, and that the happi-
ness of the rest of the world is a negligible
quantity.
If you are a man, keep smoking cigars
and sipping refreshing beverages until it
is time to eat and drink seriously; if you
are of the other sex, flirt, chatter, or
sleep, as the impulse moves you.
And when you are quite, quite sure that
you have nothing better to do, give a
glance to the racing!
SPORTIWE SONGS.
A Married Man contrasts Henley at peace with
Henley in time of war.
At PEACE (1895).
THE long reach stretches by the meads,
With placid run of ripple,
The osiers bend beside the reeds
To join them in their tipple.
Just here and there a lazy boat
Lies languid on the stream-way,
And you and I, while thus afloat,
Let all our thoughts go dream-way.
I cannot scull, you cannot steer,
And so we're slowly drifting
Beneath this sky so blue and clear
'Mid scenes that need no shifting.
All happiness is ours to-day,
No storm our bark can shiver;
But, as in Tennysonian lay,
We two go on for ever!
At WAR (1897).
The aspect's changed! Not for the best,
To him who sings this ballad.
The frou-frou of the smartly drest
Combined with lobster salad;
The signal-gun by corks is drowned,
The boom of “fizz' and sodal
What time the minstrel strains resound
That surely need a coda 1
All this I bear with humble mien,
Amid the flare and flaunting,
But really wish I ne'er had seen
This sight of jolly jaunting.
For on the house-boat, where for long
Both you and I have tarried,
I see that you are “going strong,”
And I–well, there! I'm married!

IF ANY
SKETCHES IN LONDON.
I.—IN A Boudoir.
Scene—BLANCHE's house in Mayfair.
BLANCHE and ENID sitting on sofa. BLANCHE
Jair and irresponsible. ENID dark and sensible.
Blanche. ENID, I’m rather worried. Can
I trust you?
Enid. O, BLANoHE!
Blanche. It's such an awful thing, dear!
Poor SAVILE! Ever since I married that
boy's been getting into scrapes. He now
wants to marry CARRIE Floyd, and has
written to ask me to lend him fifteen
shillings!
Enid. Is that enough to marry on ?
Blanche. Oh, of course not l But she
has a splendid salary at the where she
sings, you know. A music-hall. Besides,
dren. And think of the disparity of age!
She’s forty, and SAVILE's only sixteen.
He says he quite realizes all this; he’s not
blind to the facts; but it's—well, it's real,
you know, this time; the sort of thing you
read of; and he can't live without her.
Fancy how my people will—
Enid. Oh! I don't think you need be
anxious. I am sure there is no immediate
danger of the match.
Blanche. Really? Well, perhaps not!
ºnsible and soothing you always are,
ear .
Enid (laughing, and taking up a little
velvet case). I suppose this is a birthday
#. from Eugene. He’s a very polite
usband.
Blanche. Wasn't it nice of him? And
yet—
Enid. And the flowers?
Blanche. Oh! the orchids are from young
REEVEs. He thinks I’m a heartless, so-
phisticated woman of the world, and says
I have a “morbid attraction ” for him.
The roses are from old Colonel CAMERoN.
He says I’m so refreshingly simple and
innocent—quite a child. ALAN TRISTRAM
sent me his new book; it's horribly clever!
Enid. Isn't this a new photograph of
ALAN ? It's rather flattered.
Blanche. Well, you see, he took it him-
self. He photographs very well.
Enid. Do you still like him P
Blanche. Oh! he has faults. But I do
him a great deal of good. I appeal to his
nigner nature. Dear ENID, I envy you
sometimes for being married to a celebrity.
Enid. I don't tuink you’d like it,
BLANCHE. You’d have to order dinner.
Besides, they never get up.
Blanche. What does that matter?
know such amusing people.
Enid. Why don't you do something
yourself? Write: I'm sure you could.
Blanche. I do sometimes think I should
like to write a book—just a little, long,
narrow book, that would go easily into a
waistcoat pocket, and would make a great
sensatiou.
Enid. If it’s only so that Eugen E should
know amusing people—
Blanche. On The does, of course. But his
old friends, those who gave us wedding
presents, make love to me as if it were a
painful duty, and the others, the new ones,
talk racing, and whisper hoarsely in my
ear, “Back Silverpoint, back it when and
where you can I" and I, say, “Oh I thank
you so much ; do you think it will really
win P The dear thing! I love horses 1’’—
and then I forget all about it. ALAN
TRISTRAM has been a little trying, lately.
I had to hint that Eugene was jealous.
He isn't, really. ALAN’s going away. For
my, sake! Fancy!, He says I ennoble him,
and am made for better things.
Enid. Better than what? Than CHARLIE
REEves?
Blunche. Oh! he is a dear boy! He says
my cynical views terrify him. all miss
him very much — soon. I'm not really
cynical, you know, at all.
Enid. I suppose you represent for him
dangerous fascination.
Blanche. Well, I make up for that by
being ALAN's better angel. I keep him up
to his ideals; I lead him in the right path.
Enid. And Colonel CAMERoN ?
Blanche. Oh! he wants me to know more
of the world—more of life. Really, dear
it isn’t that one wants to pose. But #
people will call one names, how can one
help living up to them? I’m always sin-
cere. But you can't be the same to every
one; they won't let you. How anxious
I feel about SAVILE! It's seems such a
pity. To marry at sixteen 1 And a woman
who—
Enid. Talk of something else. What are
your arrangements for the early summer?
Blanche. One is coming to call this after-
Iloon.
Enid. Do I know him P
Blanche. Well, no. I met him at the
CLINToNs.
Enid. How long ago?
Blanche. Last night! Now, don't be
silly, ENID. His name is LANCE CHAL-

Blanche. Oh! I don't know ; I shall see
how things turn out. He seems thoughtful
and broad-minded. I mean, he's not a
mere trifler—takes an interest in things.
Enid. Do you mean he's a socialist?
Blanche. Oh, no! He thinks the rich
ought to have a chance, too; he sees every

the most beastly— Never mention her

Enid. O, BLANCHE!
Blanche. It's such an awful thing, dear!
Poor SAVILE! Ever since I married that
boy's been getting into scrapes. He now
wants to marry CARRIE FLOYD, and has
written to ask me to lend him fifteen
shillings!
Enid. Is that enough to marry on ?

has a splendid salary at the where she

She’s forty, and SAVILE's only sixteen.
He says he quite realizes all this; he’s not

Fancy how my people will
| Enid. Oh! I don't think you need be
anxious. I am sure there is no immediate
danger of the match.
Blanche. Really? Well, perhaps not!
How sensible and soothing you always are,
dear!
Enid (laughing, and taking up a little
velvet case). I suppose this is a birthday
#. from EUGENE. He’s a very polite
usband.
Blanche. Wasn't it nice of him? And
yet—
Enid. You don't care for jewels, do you?
Enid. And the flowers?
Blanche. Oh! the orchids are from young
REEVEs. He thinks I’m a heartless, so-
phisticated woman of the world, and says
I have a “morbid attraction ” for him.
The roses are from old Colonel CAMERON.
He says I’m so refreshingly simple and
innocent—quite a child. ALAN TRISTRAM
sent me his new book; it's horribly clever!
Enid. Isn't this a new photograph of
ALAN ? It's rather flattered.
Blanche. Well, you see, he took it him-
self. He photographs very well.
Enid. Do you still like him P
Blanche. Oh! he has faults. But I do
him a great deal of good. I appeal to his
nigner nature. Dear ENID, I envy you
sometimes for being married to a celebrity.
Enid. I don't tuink you’d like it,
BLANCHE. You’d have to order dinner.
Besides, they never get up.
Blanche. What does that matter?

Enid. Why don't you do something
yourself? Write: I’m sure you could.
Blanche. I do sometimes think I should
like to write a book—just a little, long,
narrow book, that would go easily into a
waistcoat pocket, and would make a great
sensatiou.
Enid. If it's only so that Eugene should
know amusing people— -
Blanche. On The does, of course. But his
old friends, those who gave us wedding

you so much; do you think it will really

TRISTRAM has been a little trying, lately.
I had to hint that EUGENE was jealous.
He isn't, really. ALAN’s going away. For
my sake! Fancy! He says I ennoble him,
and am made for better things.
Enid. Better than what? Than CHARLIE

Blunche. Oh! he is a dear boy! He says
my cynical views terrify him. I shall miss
him very much — soon. I’m not really
cynical, you know, at all.
Enid. I suppose you represent for him
dangerous fascination.
Blanche. Well, I make up for that by
being ALAN's better angel. T keep him up
to his ideals; I lead him in the right path.
Enid. And Colonel CAMERoN ?
Blanche. Oh! he wants me to know more

how things turn out. He seems thoughtful

“If you give me a penny, you will secure

parted with another penny to be rid of her.

deathly weary of the appeals, but what
could he do? -
“Now, you sha’n’t pass until you have
given me a copper,” cried a portly person
of unprepossessing appearance, rattling a

it will help to take a hamper to the peak

“But I have given away all my coppers.

“What does that matter? If you haven't
any bronze, I will take silver. There, give
me a florin, and I will let you pass.”
“This is absolutely highway, robbery,”

And youthful Blues,
Of rival hues
Pray hear my grumble, though it comes

Year after year

At Lord's, and º my bob to see the
Match;
And each year, too,
There's nought to do
But take my hook with more or less des- pe
patch.
The carriage folk
Sit there and smoke,
And feed and flirt, oblivious of the game,
Nor care two pins
Which party wins—
They have their annual picnic all the same.
But fifteen deep
I stand and peep
And rarely catch a casual glimpse of green;
And through the day
Of all the play
Two hits, one wide, three byes, alone I've
seen!
If I could buy
A Röntgen eye,
I might look through these solid four-in-
Drawn up all round
The blessed ground,
Where they can squeeze between the rows

To peer and crane
My miserable neck to snatch a view;

Half DRUCE's knee
And JEssop's elbow—so, to Lord's, adieu !

The ardent slug, having exhausted the

and currants. He is far from disliking, if
able to crawl, the raspberry of commerce.
The privet moth is also in grand form,
playing havoc with candles, and perform-
ing the hari-kari nightly with the aid of
lamps.
An unspeakable kind of grub harries, the
few remaining turnips and carrots. He is

Young starlings are now fully developed,

ful .#. and the immature pheasant

Cats take to the woods and spinnies,
and live on rabbits. Hares begin to be
Wasps assemble in legions, bees in co-
horts, and hornets on “special service,”
with stag-beetles in great evidence. On
the other hand, worms, well aware of the
fishing demand, have gone to their various
sanctuaries, and are difficult to shake by
the tail. The nightingale is in full voice,
and readily to be distinguished, except
when a boy is whistling late at night.

That there is plenty to do at the ranges
with the rifle, and to see in the neighbour-
hood on a bicycle.
That the conversation of your comrades
is congenial, if slightly “shoppy.”
That, after all, it is łºtº: to talk all day
of scores than of links or tyres.
That if the life becomes too monotonous,

That life under canvas is recommended

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted F.RoM THE DIARY or Toby, M.P.
House of Cºmmons, Monday, Midnight,
July 5.-Hardly know CoRPoRAL HANBURY
as he sits on Treasury Bench just now.
Seems to be literall ivelled up, whilst
;. clouds of anguish brood over his manly
row. Nothing visible in ordinary course
accounts for depression. Since he won his
stripes he has done very well. We who
remember him as PRIVATE HANBURY, some-
times marvel how, through the revolving
hours he can sit silent on Treasury Bench
whilst his old pal, CAP’EN ToMMY, talks at
large. Is it worth £2,000 a year, and the
stripes, to be thus dumbfoun ered? in the
bitter moments of early parting the CAP’EN
shewed tendency to º: his old com-
panion.
Just for a handful of silver he left us,
Just for some poor stripes to wear on his sleeve.
So trolled the Old Salt, till he was reminded
that he was parodying lines from The Lost
er.
“No leader of mine,” he gruffly said. “I
was post-captain when he signed articles.”
That natural feeling of resentment has
died away. Occasionally the CAP’EN fetches
the CoRPoRAI, a sly hit, with the tip of his
hook; but it's all kindly fun. In the
main, backs him up ; keelhauls any who
essay to belittle him. Evidently it can't
be faithful ToMMY Bowles that is at bottom
of the Financial Secretary's megrims.

A PATHETIC Figure :
Mr. H-nb-ry.
“No, Toby,” said the CoRPoRAL, fairly
breaking down, when a kind voice sounded
in his ear, “it’s that Historical Commis-
sion Report business that has upset me a
bit. Mum's the word between old con-
fidants. I don't mind telling you, as I

“When the Colonial Secretary had completed that assimilation of the Tory Party which was now
going on.”—Mr. Maclean.
“Not being desirous to be converted, not having yet arrived at that happy stage.”
with relief of the landlords, and comfort
for the clergy, we’ve been making a little
free with our takings. Then comes this
Jubilee, with perpetual strains on the
public purse. Some of the items don't
seem appalling. There's the luncheon to
Members on the Campania. One-and-
fourpence a head is, you will say, a trifle.
So it is, if, following ordinary usage, you
had only one head. But when it comes
to eight hundred, you see, it mounts up.
A sop for such a Cerberus, even at a low
contract, is a pretty expensive meal to
rovide. Thought # saw a way of re-
ieving exchequer, partially balancing
extraordinary expenditure, by savings on

A tear fell on the CoRPorAL's Orders of
the Day. I silently withdrew. Nothing
so painful as to see a six-foot-two man in
tears.
Business done.—Report stage of Work-
men's Compensation Bill.
Tuesday.—Since Mrs. MacStinger broke
in upon the retreat of the runaway Captain
Cuttle, and ordered him to return home
with her, there has been nothing equal to
the Descent of Woman on the hapless
House this afternoon. As in the case of
Mrs. MacStinger and the unsuspecting
Captain, the irruption was as unexpected
as it was volcanic. Prayers just over; a
holy calm breathed through the Chamber;
the few Members present settled them-
selves to chat till finger of clock pointed to
hour for commencement of public business;
Court.NEY observed on his legs. Later in
the sitting that would portend a lecture
and reproof for one or other, perhaps both,
olitical parties. Now private business
ing to the fore no opening for lecture.
Mr. Jimmy Lowther.
Curiosity stirred when he asked that it
might be read at table. PALGRAve, K.C.B.,
took document in hand, and, all unconscious
of Mrs. MacStinger's handwritin , boldly
plunged at its contents. The wooden horse
the Trojans unwarily dragged into their
city from the Greek camp hid no more
startling surprise. Woman had at length
been permitted to uplift her voice in House
of Commons; and she made the most of
rare opportunity. “Existing practice of
House of Commons viewed with indigna-
tion and alarm.” “ Legislation reduced to
mere game of chance.” “Just claims of
woman, repeatedly and insultingly post-
poned; ” only chance for House to escape
wrath to come was to “so reform your pro-
cedure as to secure in future fair considera-
tion of public questions with some regard
to their relative importance.” To begin
with, not only pass Woman's Rights Bill
through Committee to-morrow, but also run
it through third reading.
JEREMIAH LowthER first to regain his
breath. Was a harmless husband to be
thus addressed in the public streets?—he
meant, putting his inquiry in Parliamen-
tary form, should a petition couched in
this language be received by the House?
After some belated talk mere man grate-
fully agreed to “drop the subject.” Mean-
while, divine woman had had her say.
House more than ever yearns for female
companionship in its legislative labours.
Business done.—Lovely woman stoops to
scolding.

By a Shilling Sightseer (?).
Oh! M. C. C.
öhi Powers that Be
Likewise ye Members of the fourth Estate,
And youthful Blues,
Of rival hues
Pray hear my grumble, though it comes
too latel
Year after year
I reappear
At Lord's, an tiº my bob to see the
Match :
And each year, too,
There's nought to do
But take my hook with more or less des-
patch.
The carriage folk
Sit there and smoke,
And feed and flirt, oblivious of the game,
Nor care two pins
Which party wins—
They have their annual picnic all the same.
But fifteen deep
I stand and peep,
And rarely catch a casual glimpse of green;
And through the day
Of all the play
Two hits, one wide, three byes, alone I’ve
seen!
If I could buy
A Röntgen eye,
I might look through these solid four-in-
Drawn up all round
The blessed ground,
Where they can squeeze between the rows
of stands!
But now 'tis vain
To peer and crane
My miserable neck to snatch a view;
I merely see
Half DRUCE's knee
And JEssop's elbow—so, to Lord's, adieu !

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Midnight,
July 5.-Hardly know CoRPoRAL HANBURY
as he sits on Treasury Bench just now.
Seems to be literall ivelled up, whilst
;. clouds of anguish brood over his manly
row. Nothing visible in ordinary course
accounts for depression. Since he won his
stripes he has done very well. We who
remember him as PRIVATE HANBURY, some-
times marvel how through the revolving
hours he can sit silent on Treasury Bench
whilst his old pal, CAP’EN ToMMY, talks at
large. Is it worth £2,000 a year, and the
stripes, to be thus dumbfoundered? In the
bitter moments of early parting the CAP’EN
shewed tendency to claw his old com-
panion.
Just for a handful of silver he left us,
Just for some poor stripes to wear on his sleeve.
So trolled the Old Salt, till he was reminded
that he was parodying lines from The Lost
Leader.
“No leader of mine,” he gruffly said. “I
was post-captain when he signed articles.”
That natural feeling of resentment has
died away. Occasionally the CAP’EN fetches
the CoRPoRAI, a sly hit, with the tip of his
hook; , but it’s all kindly fun. In the
main, backs him up ; keelhauls any who
essay to belittle him. Evidently it can't
be faithful ToMMY Bowles that is at bottom
of the Financial Secretary's megrims.
A PATHETIC FIGURE I
Mr. H-nb-ry.
“No, Toby,” said the CoRPoRAL, fairly
breaking down, when a kind voice sounded
in his ear, “it’s that Historical Commis-
sion Report business that has upset me a
bit. Mum's the word between old con-
fidants. I don't mind telling you, as I
know it won't go any further, that we're
CoNTRACTING-0UT.
“When the Colonial Secretary had completed that assimilation of the Tory Party which was now
going on.”—Mr. Maclean.
“Not being desirous to be converted, not having yet arrived at that happy º
with relief of the landlords, and comfort
for the clergy, we’ve been making a little
free with our takings. Then comes this
Jubilee, with perpetual strains on the
public purse. Some of the items don't
seem appalling. There's the luncheon to
Members on the Campania. One-and-
fourpence a head is, you will say, a trifle.
So it is, if, following ordinary usage, you
had only one head. But when it comes
to eight hundred, you see, it mounts up.
A sop for such a Cerberus, even at a low
contract, is a pretty expensive meal to
rovide. Thought I saw a way of re-
ieving ... exchequer, partially balancing
extraordinary expenditure, by savings on
Reports of Historical Manuscripts Com-

them 2 Settled they should. ave at
least £50 a year to put against subsidies to
landlords and church ools. But those
fellows below gangway, opposite kick u
such shindy am obliged to abandon benefi-
cent scheme.”
A tear fell on the CoRPoRAL's Orders of
the Day. I silently withdrew. Nothing
so painful as to see a six-foot-two man in
tears.
Business done.—Report stage of Work-
men's Compensation Bill.
Tuesday.—Since Mrs. MacStinger broke
in upon the retreat of the runaway Captain
Cuttle, and ordered him to return home
with her, there has been nothing equal to
the Descent of Woman on the hapless
House this afternoon. As in the case of
Mrs. MacStinger and the unsuspecting
Captain, the irruption was as unexpected
as it was volcanic. Prayers just over; a
holy calm breathed through the Chamber;
the few Members present settled them-
selves to chat till finger of clock pointed to
hour for commencement of public business;
Court.NEY observed on his legs. Later in
the sitting that would portend a lecture
and reproof for one or other, perhaps both,
olitical parties. Now private business
ing to the fore no opening for lecture.
}. J.immy Lowther.
Curiosity stirred when he asked that it
might be read at table. PALGRAve, K.C.I.,
took document in hand, and, all unconscious
of Mrs. ifacsinger's handwritin , boldly
plunged at its contents. The wooden horse
the Trojans unwarily dragged into their
city from the Greek camp hid no more
startling surprise. Woman had at length
been permitted to uplift her voice in House
of Commons; and she made the most of
rare opportunity. “Existing practice of
House of Commons viewed with indigna-
tion and alarm.” “ Legislation reduced to
mere game of chance.” “Just claims of
woman, repeatedly and insultingly post-
poned; ” only chance for House to escape
wrath to come was to “so reform your pro-
cedure as to secure in future fair considera-
tion of public questions with some regard
to their relative importance.” To begin
with, not only pass *. Rights Bill
through Committee to-morrow, but also run
it through third reading.
JEREMIAH LowTHER first to regain his
breath. Was a harmless husband to be
thus addressed in the public streets?—he
meant, putting his inquiry in Parliamen-
tary form, should a petition couched in
this language be received by the House?
After some belated talk mere man grate-
fully agreed to “drop the subject.” Mean-
while, divine woman had had her say.
House more than ever yearns for female
companionship in its legislative labours.
Business done.—Lovely woman stoops to
scolding.

A TRAGEDY AT THE ZOO.
(After “Two Red Roses across the Moon.”)
THERE was a lady walked in a hall,
Where the Simian race is held in thrall;
And she sung as the morn grew on to noon,
Two Blue-noses" and one Baboon.
There was an ape in a cage hard by
The plumes in her hat eyed wistfully;
And he heard that lady sing at the noon,
Two Blue-noses and one Baboon.
Yet none the more she marked at all
The ape, as she paced around the hall :
But ever she sung, as it neared the noon,
Two Blue-noses and one Baboon.
Because, forsooth, her mind was set
On her young man, who had got to be met
In the monkey-house that fatal noon—
Two Blue-noses and one Baboon.
The young man came, there was no one by,
But the ape looked on with attentive eye,
And he said to himself, as they kissed at
the noon,
Two Blue-noses and one Baboon.
They stood together the cage a-near,
Theº was no one by, they had nought to
eat
Save a hairy arm 'twixt the bars at noon—
Two Blue-noses and one Baboon.
Verily then was her hat pulled through,
And, alas, her golden hair went too!
And the ape he chuckled and chattered at
noon,
Two Blue-noses and one Baboon.
I trow the young man left the hall,
Nor word to the lady spoke at all ;
And her lips were fain to curse at the noon,
Two Blue-noses and one Baboon.

CABBY’S COMPLAINT.
[“It seems that though the omnibus companies |
disgusted most of their regular customers by raising
their fares in the Jubilee sennight, they made a
good thing of it.”—Daily Chronicle.]
THE song says, “Cabby knows his Fare,”
meaning the party as he's driving;
Some do in another sense. There may be
besting and conniving,
But Cabby’s “fare” is fixed, yer see, and
most of Cabby's fares well know it.
But 'ow about the 'bus fares, hay P Fare’s

And it is only charnce or luck if we can cop

But they can pile it on at will. “Sixpence

And there you are, as right as rain' But
when his fare pore Cabby picks up,
If he should say “a bob a mile,” wouldn’t
there be a blessed bobbery P
The fare would 'owl, the bobby run yer in,
the Beak would say, “sheer robbery!”
And Cabby, 'e would cop the knock. Now,

W’y should a Cabby get it 'ot all round,
with a fair chance o' prison,
For doin’ wot the 'Bus Co.'s do permiskus

And 'appy altogetherishness, and all this

Will say if fares is fair all round; and if
they ain't so, wot's the matter?
W’y should them wallopping cars be free to

“PAS DERCHARGE” A CANTERBURY.
LAst week the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, having caved in
before the guns of Lord CHARLEs BEREsford,the ñean and Chapter
of Canterbury Cathedral, fearingalike fate, summoned to their aid
“Lieutenant-Colonel S. Newton DICKENson, High Seneschal of
Canterbury Cathedral”—(splendid title, but majority of folks
never, heard of him before, which shows, the blissfulness of
majority's ignorance)—who forthwith attacked the “Pious
Pilgrim" for having written to the Times, narrating how he
(the P. P. and friends) had refused to pay an attendant, “as
verger clad,” half-a-crown for a private view of some part of
the Cathedral. Pious Pilgrim withstood the charge. Gallant
Colonel DICKENson, of the Church Militant, returned to the
charge (of half-a-crown extra, the usual fee for a party being
sixpence a head), and bore down on the Pious Pi grim. For
ourselves, we would, judicially and judiciously, suggest that
there should be a few special vergers in attendance to take
care of those wishing for a quiet time in the Cathedral apart
from the wearied and wearying parroty guide and the crowding
tourists that usually accompany him, and that these guardian
angels should be empowered to charge extra for the special
privilege. But why cannot the 'umble Canterbury Pilgrim be
allowed to wander about the Cathedral just where he likes, fancy
free, all day, if he be so minded, without his reveries being dis-
turbed by vergers, guides, Deans, and Chapters-out-of-guide-
books? The “Pious Pilgrim” will take precious good care to
isolate himself from the crowd; and if the Pious Pilgrim puts in
his pious pence, why should not the entire Cathedral be open to
him, crypt and all? Try the penny-in-the-slot principle. Put a
penny in and “Open, Sesame!”. Of course, place a detective
verger or two to walk about and watch, lest Pious Pilgrim P.
ieces with pocket penknife, in which case Pious P. could be
ded over to Canterbury Constable, or—let Lieutenant-Colonel
Newton Dickenson, High Seneschal, at his full height, be sent
for, and let the Ready Representative of the Church Militant
take prisoner the Impudent Iconoclast, and confine him in the
deepest dungeon of the castle moat, wherever that may be.

duced H.R.H. the Prince of WALEs to impress on the Dean and
Chapter of St. Paul's the falsity of the step they were contem-
plating in their design of removing the BRUGEs memorial from its
lace in St. Paul's to make room for a bust of Sir FREDERIC
EIGHToN, P.R.A. So the Dean and Chapter, unable to with-
stand this broadside, have decided, in a truly nautical Beres-
fordian fashion, to keep Admiral BRUGEs aboard, and to “let go
the painter.” Simple folk used to think that Bruges was in
Belgium. Now they know that BRUGEs is in London, at St. Paul's.

ETON P. HARROW.
It seems to me inexpressibly sad that
these two Schools should still be pitted one
against the other. The same thing hap-
E. last year, and, I believe, the year
fore. But in the name of common
sense, speaking as a rate-payer, what is all
the trouble about? What grievance has
Harrow against Eton, or, if it comes to
that, Eton against Harrow? Surely it
would be a graceful act in this year of
—the word begins with a J–if these
Schools could shake hands and bury the
cricket-bat. Besides, it might take root
and become a wooden wall.
As one HAROLD, some time the local
king, remarked, with so much truth, “The
playing fields of Eton were lost at the
Battle of Hastings.” Of course the match
at Lord's may be a great moral influence.
That is the stage name of anything that
seems to serve no useful purpose. But
what does it decide? Nothing. If Eton
beats Harrow, the Etonians do not take
that Hill. If Harrow beats Eton, no wet
Bobs are sent into captivity. en the
question arises, “Why do it?” It is
splendid, but is it sense ? And the tax-
payer? Half a crown is surely a great deal
of money to ; for the privilege of
walking about, bedecorated as for a belated
cattle show.
Possibly, when the other Lords are
abolished, this one will go, too. And it
is high time, for yesterday I witnessed
a disgraceful scene. A bright young lad
strolled aimlessly, and quite inoffensively,
out of the pavilion to potter about at
the wicket. It seemed silly, but anyhow,
he took his pleasure that way. Suddenly
a stupendous stripling, apparently a com-
plete stranger, seized a solid sphere, and
without a word of warning hurled it at
the bright young mind. Brave little
fellow! Armed only with a cricket-bat,
possibly a present from his mother, he

OPERATIC NOTES.
Inez Mendo-How is the new Opera liked? “Some men do
some men don't,” as an old refrain has it; but the consensus of
opinion seemed, at the première, when our Representative Riter
was present, to be decidedly favourable, and the feeling of the
house friendly towards the composer, Mr. D'ERLANGER, who, as a
well-informed critic on a daily paper confided to his readers, is “a
gentleman well known in financial circles”—though how this
directly concerns his capability as a musical composer is not by
any means evident. Perhaps some sly allusion to “notes” was
intended, and, equally, perhaps it wasn't. However, be this as
it may, famous will be the successful financier who can write a suc-
Qessful 9pera, and Beatified the Banker who can compose a
beautiful ballet! A tuneful Timon or a musical MAECENAs, how
welcome! This prefatial. Inez Mendo, by Mr. D'ERLANGER-
longer-loo, has made a decided hit. Madame SAVILLE, as the
Spanish heroine (“Sweet Savillel”), is charming, both as to her
acting and singing; while, as to Miss MARGARET REID, the com-
poser is fortunate in finding such a REID, not a broken Reid on
which to trust his weight, but a tuneful REID whereon to pipe his
tunes, especially that one in the first act, where she replies to the
singing, “heard off.” The first two lines, in English, of the
village chorus are,
-- Avº you joyous lads and lasses,
o the house of Inigo,”
which may perhaps be a misprint for
“To the house,_and in we go '''
But whatever the words may be, the music and the singing left
nothing to be desired,—except to have some “more where that
came from.” Signor Alvarez was in good voice, and uncommonly
Mlle. BAUERMEisTER were “two village girls,”—lucky the village
that could be full of such clever i. M. Renaud impressive
as the headsman Juan Mendo, showing how finely he could exe-
cute his musical task. The finish of the Opera is a sort of go-as-
you-please affair, since the tender-hearted librettist makes
Mendo, on one side of the last page, commit suicide, while on the
other side Mendo only injures himself.so slightly with the dangerous
weapon that the Rev. Mr. Pintado, “Vicar of Monclar” (played

OPERATIC NOTES.
Inez Mendo-How is the new Opera liked? “Some men do,
some men don't,” as an old refrain has it; but the consensus of
opinion seemed, at the première, when our Representative Riter
was present, to be decidedly favourable, and the feeling of the
house friendly towards the composer, Mr. D'ERLANGER, who, as a
well-informed critic on a daily paper confided to his readers, is “a
gentleman well known in financial circles”—though how this
directly concerns his capability as a musical composer is not by
any means evident. Perhaps some sly allusion to “notes” was
intended, and, equally, perhaps it wasn't. However, be this as
it may, famous will be the successful financier who can write a suc-
Qessful 9pera, and Beatified the Banker who can compose a
beautiful ballet! A tuneful Timon or a musical MacENAs, how
welcome! This prefatial. Inez Mendo, by Mr. D'ERLANGER-
longer-loo, has made a decided hit. Madame Saville, as the
Spanish heroine (“Sweet Savillel”), is charming, both as to her
acting and singing; while, as to Miss MARGARET REID, the com-
poser is fortunate in finding such a REID, not a broken Reid on
which to trust his weight, but a tuneful REID whereon to pipe his
tunes, especially that one in the first act, where she replies to the
singing, “heard off.” The first two lines, in English, of the
village chorus are,
“Away, you joyous lads and lasses,
o the house of Inigo,”
which may perhaps be a misprint for
“To the house,_and in we go '''
But whatever the words may be, the music and the singing left
nothing to be desired, except to have some “more where that
came from.” Signor Alvarez was in good voice, and uncommonly
Mlle. BAUERMEISTER were “two village girls,”-lucky the village
that could be full of such clever i. M. RENAUD impressive
as the headsman Juan Mendo, showing how finely he could exe-
cute his musical task. The finish of the Opera is a sort of go-as-
you-please affair, since the tender-hearted librettist makes
Mendo, on one side of the last page, commit suicide, while on the
other sideMendo only injures himself.so slightly with the dangerous
lº that the Rev. Mr. Pintado, “Vicar of Monclar” (played
by Mr. GILIBERT), being something of a surgeon as well as a
clergyman, is able to pronounce an opinion gratis to the effect
that “His hurt may yet be healed,” that is, that he is already
“on the mend Ol” and goes on to explain how Inez “in clinging
to his arm, diverted the keen poignard.” So not only did Inez
“divert "a poignard, but she also delighted an anxious audience.
Personally, we prefer the happy finish; but the purchaser of

it seems, was one of the things which were managed far better
in the *. “when,” I read, “there was a delightful spirit in
private letters, a stately formality in those concerning matters of
business.” Why should I not contribute towards wished-for im-
provement? Yes, I will.
I.—To My BootMAKER.
“To Messrs. TAG AND LACE, makers of boots, shoes, and slippers,
Greeting. We by these presents do make known unto you that
we require for our own personal use and adornment one pair of

That ought to impress them, I think. Now for my tailor, who
asks for the “settlement of his little account.”
II.--To Thomas SNIPs, TAILoR.
“How now, saucy varlet!, Dost think to affright me with thy
foolish threats? Beshrew thee, right sore shall thy pate be if
thou thus addressest me again. “Small account,” forsoothl Q
SNIPs, SNIPs, the love of money hath gotten hold of thee; iii
indeed is thy craving for this world's dross, nor will I aid thee
in satisfying it. Out upon thee for a scurvy | "
Feel quite sure that SNIPs has never had a letter like that in all
his life, and the effect upon him will be tremendous. Next
comes an invitation to dinner. Yes, the modern way of answer-
ing invitations is deplorably bald. How much nobler is the
Queen Anne style, which I shall henceforward adopt for letters of
this kind!
III.--To MRs. SNUPhkins, QUEEN's GATE, LoNDoN.:
Madam,_Of all the º which we poor mortals are per-
mitted to enjoy, not least, the philosophers tell us, is the pleasure
your sex, you have granted to me, the humblest of your devoted
servants. How long will the days seem, how slowly will the
hours pass until, at 8 P.M., on the 24th, I can obey your com-
mands, I can hasten into your presence, I can bask in the divine
sunshine of your smiles! Until which time, Madam, I would
have you to know that I am, and shall continue to be for ever,
your most devoted servant and irer, THoMAs Jones.”
Yes, what an improvement is that upon “Mr. Jones has much
leasure in accepting Mrs. SNUPHKINs' kind invitation for the
th inst. 1" Only one more letter this morning—to my old
Aunt TABITHA. This is clearly a case for that “delightful ease
and familiarity,” which, the article tells me, ought to be manifest
in one's letters to relatives and friends.
IV.--To My AUNT TABITHA.
“Well, old TABBY, how are you? Pretty fit, I hope P Have
you got a new wig yet, by the way? That last one of yours was
a fair terror—wouldn’t deceive a cow. How are the missionary
meetings getting on? I suppose you get a good commission on
the tracts, don't you? Let me hear from you before Goodwood,
and I’ll put you up to one or two real good things, in which you
can invest the takings of your collecting-boxes. You want me to
stay with you again at Puddleton, but you don’t catch me at
that game twice. I remember my last visit far too well to let
Hºff in for another of the same sort. Well, so * old girl.
Keep your pecker up. Yours ever, oMAs.”
Plenty of “esprit and playful badinage” there, I think. Yes,
the article is quite right—letters of this kind are a great improve-
ment on the modern sort, with “their curt sentences, their un-
polished style, their hurried manner.” I shall await the replies
with much interest.
P.S.—Two days later.—After all, I'm afraid I can’t recom-
mend my friends to follow my example. My bootmakers “must
decline to take my order,” and my tailor is about to take legal
proceedings against me. Major SNUPHKINs proposes to call upon
me with a horsewhip, alleging that I have grossly insulted his
wife, and Aunt TABITHA has promptly cut, me, out of her will!
Alas, why did I read that fatal article? Clearly the age is not
ripe for reforml

II.--To Thomas SNips, TAILoR.
“How now, saucy varlet! Dost think to affright me with thy
foolish threats? Beshrew thee, right sore shall thy pate be if
thou thus addressest me again. “Small account,” forsoothl Q
SNIPs, SNIPs, the love of money hath gotten hold of thee; iii
indeed is thy craving for this world's dross, nor will I aid thee
in satisfying it. Out upon thee for a scurvy rascal!”
Feel quite sure that SNIPs has never had a letter like that in all
his life, and the effect upon him will be tremendous. Next
comes an invitation to dinner. Yes, the modern way of answer-
ing invitations is deplorably, bald. How much nobler, is the
Queen Anne style, which I shall henceforward adopt for letters of
this kindl
III.--To MRs. SNUPhkins, QUEEN's GATE, LoNDoN.:
Madam,_Of all the º which we poor mortals are per-
mitted to enjoy, not least, the philosophers tell us, is the pleasure
your sex, you have granted to me, the humblest of your devoted
servants. How long will the days seem, how slowly will the
hours pass until, at 8 P.M., on the 24th, I can obey your com-
mands, I can hasten into your presence, I can bask in the divine
|Sunshine of your smiles l Until which time, Madam, I would
have you to know that I am, and shall continue to be for ever,
your most devoted servant and admirer, THoMAs Jon Es.”
Yes, what an improvement is that upon “Mr. Jones has much
leasure in accepting Mrs. SNUPHKINs' kind invitation for the
th inst. 1" Only one more letter this morning—to my old
Aunt TABITHA. This is clearly a case for that “ £º ease
and familiarity,” which, the article tells me, ought to be manifest
in one's letters to relatives and friends.
IV.--To My AUNT TABITHA.
“Well, old TABBY, how are you? Pretty fit, I hope P Have
you got a new wig yet, by the way? That last one of yours was
a fair terror—wouldn’t deceive a cow. How are the missionary
meetings getting on? I suppose you get a good commission on
the tracts, don't you? Let me hear from you before Goodwood.
and I’ll put you up to one or two real good things, in which you
can invest the takings of your collecting-boxes. You want me to
stay with you again at Puddleton, but you don't catch me at
that game twice. I remember my last visit far too well to let
j in for another of the same sort. Well, so long, old girl.
Keep your pecker up. Yours ever, omas.”
Plenty of “esprit and playful badinage” there, I think. Yes,
the article is quite right—letters of this kind are a great improve-
ment on the modern sort, with “their curt sentences, their un-
polished style, their hurried manner.” I shall await the replies
with much interest.
P.S.—Two days later.—After all, I'm afraid I can't recom-
mend my friends to follow my example. My bootmakers “must
decline to take my order,” and my tailor is about to take legal
proceedings against me. Major SNUPHKINs proposes to call upon
me with a horsewhip, alleging that I have grossly insulted his
wife, and Aunt TABITHA has promptly cut, me, out of her will!
Alas, why did I read that fatal article? Clearly the age is not
ripe for reforml


of anticipation. And that delight, "O incomparably fairest of

REFLECTIONS ON A BROKEN ENGAGEMENT.
HER REFLECTIONs. (See p. 12.)
“WE parted l’” Yes, I saw your verse,
Which, though (thank heaven) so far
true,
Has only made me think the worse,
If that is possible, of you.
I think iſ. positively base
To tell the public how we parted,
I think you might have had the grace
To be a little broken-heartedl
I think, to give you answer back,
I’d sooner wed an utter scamp
Than any virtuous maniac,
Whose soul is centred in-a stamp !
I think a girl, to be your wife,
Should be, what I am not, ambitious
To share one lofty aim in life~

And so do “Bob,” and “Dick,” and

I think I’ve put you to the rout;
Let me return to where you started—
“We parted—cheerfully.” No doubt.
To me the main point is—we partedl

THE CARETAKER'S WADE MECUM.
Question. What do you consider your
duties?
Answer. To keep in the house in which
I am *. and make myself comfortable.
$, s your comfort your first considera-
tion
A. Certainly; as that would be the
wish of my employer.
3. If you occupy an unfurnished house,
and have to show over a possible tenant,
what do you do?
A. I take care that the possible tenant
shall know that the basement is damp, and
the *: of the reception rooms awkward.
Q. Then you point out the defects?
A. Very freely; as it would never do to
make a false impression.
Q. When you are in an unfurnished
house, how long can you remain?
A. As long as I please, for visitors
...y adopt the opinions of the resident
guide.
Q: Do you take charge of furnished
residences during the absence of their
owners at the seaside or on the continent P
A. Of course; and then I turn the best
drawing-room into my boudoir, while using
the pantry as a resting-place.
Can you answer the questions of
callers?
A. Only by saying, “I am sure I don't
know where they have gone.”
Q. Can you give any further informa-
tion?
A. Yes; I can say, “I don't know when
any of them are coming back.”
Q. But surely that might create an im-
pression that the owners were ruined and
sold ".
A. May be ; but that is their business,
and not mine.
Q. And do you give satisfaction to your
SPORTIVE SONGS.

with whom he has dallied, for circulating

Without the anger boiling

A shaft that others handlel
The thunder in the air, may be,

I did not mean your charms to slight—
How could I? They’re entrancing !
Does not your presence give delight?

That makes a waltz seem airy.
Why letters so absurd inscribe

MADAME SARAH BERNBARDT went to

preparations. Mayor, with Corporation,
ready to receive her. She came, she saw,
and, according to the Daily mail, noticing
that there were many steps up to the town-
hall, where the dignitaries awaited her,
she refused to ascend, and instead, she,
like Mr. Boz when he had made all his
preparations for committing suicide,
“walked off in the opposite direction”—
that is, drove off, leaving Mr. Mayor
planté lä.

chorus of “Sally, come up,” still popular

Soon after this contretemps, Mr.
MAYER, of BERNHARDT staff, called on Mr.
Mayor of Portsmouth, and explained why
S. B. would not take those steps up to the
town-hall, and why she took the step she
did. No doubt the explanation was satis-

Question. What is the difference be-
tween a Circumlocution Office and a Com-
mittee of Inquiry?
Answer. One objects to questions and

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY or Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 12.—
Of all places in the world, House of Lords
to-day, narrowly escaped becoming scene
of deplorable scandal. Danger skirted in
connection with discussion on the ques-
tion of County versus Diocesan O-
ciations for administration of Voluntary
Schools Act. WANTAGE, V.C., complains
that in the county I have the honour
to represent in the Commons, the Oxford
Diocesan Conference have jockeyed the
managers of the schools. Managers
elected representatives to choose two
delegates for each rural deanery in Berk-
shire, such delegates to be the governing
body, for educational purposes, of the
County Association. The Oxford Diocesan
Conference, backed up by the Archbishop
of CANTERBURY, got at the representatives,
and when the business was concluded, the
school managers, who are all in favour of
a County Association, found to their pious
horror that their men had voted for a
Diocesan Association!
What the school managers said when
they heard of the success of this archi-
episcopal plot probably is not translatable
into Parliamentary language. Anyhow,
WANTAGE, V.C., who never, served with
our army in Flanders, refrained from
quoting it, depending for effect upon the
simple narrative of Diocesan Episcopal
Speech brought up Bishop of Oxford,
who strongly objected to having the little
performance “put forward as an attempted
fraud.” WANTAGE, V.C., disclaimed such
intention. Bishop accepted disclaimer
but, turning upon the hero of Alma, an
Inkerman, said in plaintive tones, “But
why, my dear Lord, did you kick me
downstairs?”
This sudden inquiry added infinitely to
growing horror of situation. Lord SPENCER
made haste to change subject by disclosing
similar clerical plot in Northamptonshire.
In the end, rising passion soothed by
speech from Duke of DEvoNSHIRE, whose
yawn (it being a sultry afternoon) was so
contagious that the Primate, who looked
like fighting, dozed off.
SARK hopes the incident will escape the
notice of }. gentlemen who draw up con-
tents-bills for evening papers. He remem-
bers case in early history of evening jour-
nalism, where the town was startled by
reading in largest type on the bill,
“CHARGE of INDECENCY AGAINST THE
Bishop of Oxford.” It was in Dr. WIL-
BERFoRCE's time. SARK, humbled and
horrified, bought a paper. After diligent
search, found in Parliamentary report that
somebody (he thinks it was the Duke of
ARGYLL) had in course of debate spoken of
“the almost indecent warmth" of the
Bishop's advocacy of some small matter.
Here is a double chance for the lively
contents-bill. “CHARGE of FRAUD AGAINST
THE ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY | " “THE

“WE ted!”. Yes, I saw your verse,

THE CARETAKER'S WADE MECUM.
Question. What do you consider your
duties?
Answer. To keep in the house in which
I am placed, and make myself comfortable.
Q. #. your comfort your first considera-
tion?
A. Certainly; as that would be the
wish of my employer.
3. If you occupy an unfurnished house,
and have to show over a possible tenant,
what do you do?
A. I take care that the possible tenant
shall know that the basement is damp, and
the *i. of the reception rooms awkward.
Q. Then you point out the defects?
A. Very freely; as it would never do to
make a false impression.
Q. When you are in an unfurnished
house, how long can you remain?
A. As long as I please, for visitors
...y adopt the opinions of the resident
guide.
Q: Do you take charge of furnished
residences during the absence of their
owners at the seaside or on the continent?
A. Of course; and then I turn the best
drawing-room into my boudoir, while using
the pantry as a resting-place.
#. Can you answer the questions of
callers?
A. Only by saying, “I am sure I don't
know where they have gone.”
Q. Can you give any further informa-
tion?
A. Yes; I can say, “I don't know when
any of them are coming back.”
Q. But surely that might create an im-
pression that the owners were ruined and
sold up?
A. My be; but that is their business,

That makes a waltz seem airy.
Why letters so absurd inscribe

SARA'S LATEST SCENE.
MADAME SARAH BERNBARDT went to
play La Tosca at Portsmouth. Great
preparations. Mayor, with Corporation,
ready to receive her. She came, she saw,
and, according to the Daily Mail, noticing
that there were many steps up to the town-
hall, where the dignitaries awaited her,
she refused to ascend, and instead, she,
like Mr. Boz when he had made all his
preparations for committing suicide,
“walked off in the opposite direction”—
that is, drove off, leaving Mr. Mayor
planté lä.
Our inspired poet, remembering the old
chorus of “Sally, come up,” .# popular
with niggers on the sands in summer-time,
says: —
“SALLY, come up !” But SALLY did frown,
Staring at Mayor in chain and gown;
Then SALLY . off to inn in town.
Now who can read the riddle *
Soon after this contretemps, Mr.
MAYER, of BERNHARDT staff, called on Mr.
Mayor of Portsmouth, and explained why
S. B. would not take those steps up to the
town-hall, and why she took the step she
did. No doubt the explanation was satis-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 12.—
Of all places in the world, House of Lords
to-day, narrowly escaped becoming scene
of deplorable scandal. Danger skirted in
connection with discussion on the ques-
tion of County versus Diocesan O-
ciations for administration of Voluntary
Schools Act. WANTAGE, V.C., complains
that in the county I have the honour
to represent in the Commons, the Oxford
Diocesan Conference have jockeyed the
managers of the schools. Managers
elected representatives to choose two
delegates for each rural deanery in Berk-
shire, such delegates to be the governing
body, for educational purposes, of the
County Association. The Oxford Diocesan
Conference, backed up by the Archbishop
of CANTERBURY, got at the representatives,
and when the business was concluded, the
school managers, who are all in favour of
a County Association, found to their pious
horror that their men had voted ł. a.
Diocesan Association!
What the school managers said when
they heard of the success of this archi-
episcopal plot probably is not translatable
into Parliamentary language. Anyhow,
WANTAGE, V.C., who never served with
our army in Flanders, refrained from
quoting it, depending for effect upon the
simple narrative of Diocesan Episcopal
Speech brought up Bishop of OxFord,
who strongly objected to having the little
performance “put forward as an attempted
fraud.” WANTAGE, V.C., disclaimed such
intention. Bishop accepted disclaimer,
but, turning upon the hero of Alma, and
Inkerman, said in plaintive tones, “But
why, my dear Lord, did you kick me
downstairs?”
This sudden inquiry added infinitely to
growing horror of situation. Lord SPENCER
made haste to change subject by disclosing
similar clerical plot in Northamptonshire.
In the end, rising passion soothed by
speech from Duke of DEvoNSHIRE, whose
yawn (it being a sultry afternoon) was so
contagious that the Primate, who looked
like fighting, dozed off.
SARK hopes the incident will escape the
notice of the gentlemen who draw up con-
tents-bills for evening papers. He remem-
bers case in early history of evening jour-
nalism, where the town was startled by
reading in largest type on the bill,

House of Commons, Tuesday.—Report
current that, before going into Committee
on Foreign Prison-made Goods, RITCHIE

“We’ve risked enough,” President of
Board of Trade is reported to have said,
“by taking up this precious idea of yours
and really can't stand you prancing roun
whilst I’m trying to shove the thing
through.”
Probably no truth in the story. Cer-
tainly the gallant Colonel refrained from
speaking, that is, from delivering ordered
speech. Through frequent divisions, his
voice was heard like rolling drums that
beat to battle where he stands. Once he
cried out, “No! no!” when PARKER SMITH
proposed to withdraw an amendment. In
the main, he found relief for overcharged
feelings in muttered commentary. Also,

WEARIsoME WEIR expressed a wish that
RITCHIE “would confine himself within
the four walls of the prison, especially in
relation to the manufacture of locks.”

to the disease of Lough-jaw, from which
the Committee to-night suffered in excep-

the Chairman ruled the observation out of

stood it. Towards midnight, PRINCE
ARTHUR mercifully attempted to cut
tangled skein by the Closure. But that
did not carry Bill through Committee.
“I hope RITCHIE likes his arrange-
ments,” said HowARD VINCENT, with a
gleam of malice in his eyes. “If he'd left
the Bill in my charge, I would not only
have got it through Committee to-night,

“But,” I ventured to remark, “you're

“I hope not,” said the SouTRE, with a
far-away look in his eyes. “I Dhir hone

Bournemouth. — The beautiful bay is
studded with pleasure boats, and the
beach strown with bathing machines. Six
thousand excursionists visited the Winter
Gardens to-day, and the price of whiskey
has risen. Among the latest arrivals are
the Earl and Countess of FloundER and
Ladies Sole, Sir REGINALD RAPPEE, and
Baron BUNco of New York.
Brighton.—A fresh breeze is blowing off
the land, and in the midst of lovely sun-
shine the pleasure yachts are doing a hand-
some trade. An interesting accident very
nearly occurred this morning to Miss
PENELoPE LIPNEck, youngest daughter of
Alderman Sir ULysses LIPNEck, Kt. The
young lady in question was fishing off
the West Pier for crabs, when an enor-
mous crustacean, presumably a mammoth
lcbster, seized the bait, and would in-
fallibly have dragged the fair votary of
Isaac WALton into a submarine grave,

Queen of watering places have been mate-
rially increased during the past few days
by many vocal and instrumental artists of
both sexes, now on their way to the Ducal
groves of Goodwood. Shrimps are cheaper.
Cromer.—With considerable right, cer-
tain of the most influential towns-folk have
resolved to bestow the title of Queen-
Empress of the East Coast upon this fa-
voured resort. The influx of visitors is
not altogether dissimilar from the descent
of the Huns on the sunny plains of Italy,
and like the progressipn of the barbarians
of old, it never ceases. Last night a
bagatelle board was converted into a bed-
stead by a lady, who receives paying
guests. The bands are numerous and har-
monious, and the popular airs appear to
be “Sweet Marie” and “Beer, Beer,
Glorious Beer!” Several large butterflies
have been caught on the cliffs. The
second cousin once removed of the Rajah
of BANDIcoot is expected here next week.
Douglas (Isle of Man).-As usual in the
land of the Deemster, the Liverpudlians
are flocking to recruit their jaded appetites
with plenty of bracing pick-me-ups com-
| pounded of sea-air and sea-bathing in
equal proportions. Some capital negro
minstrels help the general gaiety of the
scene. It is scarcely necessary to add that
Sir WALTER Scott derived most of the
inspiration which pervades Peveril of the
Peak from this hardy little island, enjoy-
ing the benefit of Home Rule denied to
her larger, but not more important,
neighbours.
Dover.—Nothing can be more interest-
ing for a visitor to watch than the rapid
progress now being made on the new
Harbour Works. The driving of piles,
with the concomitant bustle, is as exciting
as the cinematographe, while the arrivals
at and departures from the Admiralty
"|Pier constitute a veritable kaleidoscope of
International indisposition on the narrow
way. The Duchess of GoRGoNzola and
suite passed through here on her way to
Switzerland. There have been several
expeditions by road to St. Margaret's Bay,
whence the secrets of empires are whirled
over the bed of the ocean. An officer of
one of the Belgian steam packets has been
seen to order some stout bottled in Eng-
land. Naturally great excitement prevails.
Eastbourne.—The trees are now in full
leaf, thanks to the Duke of DEvoNshi RE,
and what visitor in the romantic park
named after his grace would fail to main-
tain that lawn tennis is the birthright of
every Eastbournian P. Picnics on Beachy
Head are of daily occurrence, and it is
said that a London glass merchant has
made a contract for collecting the disused
and abandoned bottles. At this time of
year the coastguards are always in prime
condition, and old salts with smuggling
tales are at a premium. Owing to the
influence of the aristocracy, the sale of
winkles is not what it might be, though
liberally supported by the Salvation Army.
Folkestone.—A curious incident occurred
here last night. As a gentleman was walk-
ing on the Lees, an enormous poodle dog
obstructed his path, and but for the
courage of its owner, Colonel WALTER
WAGTAIL, would no doubt have left its
mark upon the unfortunate visitor.
Happily, the catastrophe was averted, and
supper at the Pavilion was the sequel of
what might have been a lamentable con-
tretemps. The boats to Boulogne run with
remarkable regularity, and the pleasure of
seeing passengers land has been distinctly
discounted by the fact that the sea has
been remarkably smooth. The Wicomte
de NERoN, direct descendant of the Em-
nerors of Rome, has organised a picnic at
Caesar's Camp.

We are, it see dependent on North

United States and Russia go to war with
us; stop supplies; in a week stock of corn
and flour in Great Britain exhausted;
famine stalks through the land; supply of

£30,000,000 to buy corn, store it up
against the day when iniquitous designs of
Russia and the United States shall be
accomplished. St. MICHAEL swears b
All Angels he will have nothing to do wit

Brighton.—A fresh breeze is blowing off
the land, and in the midst of lovely sun-
shine the pleasure yachts are doing a hand-
some trade. An interesting accident very
nearly occurred this morning to Miss
PENELoPE LIPNEck, youngest daughter of
Alderman Sir Ulysses LIPNEck, Kt. The
young lady in question was fishing off
the West Pier for crabs, when an enor-
mous crustacean, presumably a mammoth
lcbster, seized the bait, and would in-
fallibly have dragged the fair votary of
Isaac WALTon into a submarine grave,

not altogether dissimilar from the descent
of the Huns on the sunny plains of Italy,
and like the progressipn of the barbarians
of old, it never ceases. Last night a
bagatelle board was converted into a bed-
stead by a lady, who receives paying
guests. The bands are numerous and har-
monious, and the popular airs appear to
be “Sweet Marie” and “Beer, Beer,
Glorious Beer!” Several large butterflies
have been caught on the cliffs. The
second cousin once removed of the Rajah
of BANDIcoot is expected here next week.
Douglas (Isle of Man).-As usual in the
land of the Deemster, the Liverpudlians
are flocking to recruit their jaded appetites
with plenty of bracing pick-me-ups com-
pcunded of sea-air and sea-bathing in
equal proportions. Some capital negro
minstrels help the general gaiety of the
scene. It is scarcely necessary to add that
Sir WALTER Scott derived most of the
inspiration which pervades Peveril of the
Peak from this hardy little island, enjoy-
ing the benefit of Home Rule denied to
her larger, but not more important,
neighbours.
Dover.—Nothing can be more interest-
ing for a visitor to watch than the rapid
É. now being made on the new
rbour Works. e driving of piles,
with the concomitant bustle, is as exciting
as the cinematographe, while the arrivals
at and departures from the Admiralty
"|Pier constitute a veritable kaleidoscope of
International indisposition on the narrow
way. The Duchess of GoRGoNzola and
suite passed through here on her way to
Switzerland. There have been several
expeditions by road to St. Margaret's Bay,
whence the secrets of empires are whirled
over the bed of the ocean. An officer of
one of the Belgian steam packets has been
seen to order some stout bottled in Eng-
land. Naturally great excitement prevails.
Eastbourne.—The trees are now in full
leaf, thanks to the Duke of DEvoNshi RE,
and what visitor in the romantic park
named after his grace would fail to main-
tain that lawn tennis is the birthright of
every Eastbournian P. Picnics on Beachy
Head are of daily occurrence, and it is
said that a London glass merchant has
made a contract for collecting the disused
and abandoned bottles. At this time of
year the coastguards are always in prime
condition, and old salts with smuggling
tales are at a premium. Owing to the
influence of the aristocracy, the sale of
winkles is not what it might be, though
liberally supported by the Salvation Army.
Folkestone.—A curious incident occurred
here last night. As a gentleman was walk-
ing on the Lees, an enormous poodle dog
obstructed his path, and but for the
courage of its owner, Colonel WALTER
WAGTAIL, would no doubt have left its
mark upon the unfortunate visitor.
Happily, the catastrophe was averted, and
supper at the Pavilion was the sequel of
what might have been a lamentable con-
tretemps. The boats to Boulogne run with
remarkable regularity, and the pleasure of
seeing passengers land has been distinctly
discounted by the fact that the sea has
been remarkably smooth. The Wicomte

nerors of Rome, has organised a picnic at

AT THE THEATRE.
DRAB MustER,--I recall to me my first visit to an english
theatre. In that time there I spoke at pain a hundred of words,
and by consequence I carried alldays a dictionary of pocket in the
which I searched the translation º the french phrases. Happily
I had heard to say that the English go to the theatre in great
holding, en grande tenue, and I carried my habit, all to fact as
be must... I am gone to a theatre where they played an operette.
If I could not to comprehend the words, I could to hear the
music and to regard the dances.
I, part in handsome cab, and I arrive to the theatre. Since
that time there. I have learnt that one should alldays to retain a
lace in the principal theatres, as at Paris, and that, not as at
aris, the location costs not more dear. Eh well, I mount the
perron, and, having found the word fauteuil in my dictionary, I
demand at the guichet, “one armchair of orchestra.” The em-
ployed responds, “One stol.” Une stalle, ah mon! “One arm-
chair of balcony,” I say. And him of to respond, et lui de
répondre, “Dreseukl.” What is this that this is that that? Pas
de fauteuil d'orchestre, de fauteuil de balcon. “Can one to
have one place in a lodge?” I demand to him. “A lodging,”
says he. “Yes,” I respond to him, “a lodging.” Sans aucun
doute ca veut dire une petite loge. “No, Maounsiah,” responds
he, “not here, you must go to-morrow to a haoussaigentt.”
“To-morrow,” I say; “but I desire to see the operette this
º Give to me then any place, even a stall, if you have

resign myself to pass the evening very squeezed, serré, on a
bench all to fact in arrear under the balcony. But a pretty little
female opener, ouvreuse, indicates to me an excellent fauteuil
d'orchestre, absolutely at the centre, large and comfortable, where
I install myself between two charming ladys in toilets of evening
of the most elegants. I regard around and I see partout some
adorable ladys, and not one sole hat. And all the men in habit.
It is an evening of galal Ten shillings six pennys for that, it is
not too much dear, by blue !
During the between-act, l'entr’acte, at Paris all the world goes
out. That he makes hot, that he makes cold, what that may be
who arrives, one quits his place, and one walks himself in the
foyer, or in the couloirs, or in the street, or one drinks a bock or
a lemon with some water of seltz in a café at side. As that one
escapes from the suffocating atmosphere of the parisian theatre,
but at the fine that becomes fatiguing, and if the piece is in
several acts and the between-acts drag in longness, trainent en
longueur, one traverses some kilomètres in marching of long in
large. At fondon one can to repose himself tranquilly in his
armchair, if he wishes not to smoke a cigarette, or to drink a
“wisky” at the english mode, in the refreshments-room, that
which one calls in french, “le bar.” I find that more commo-
dious, plus commode.
At the fine, in going out of the theatre, he falls of the rain,
that which arrives often at London, sometimes at Paris. Ciel,
est-on bousculé! I arrest myself at the entry, seeking a handsome
cab, and all these ladys, several very fat, several of high waist,
de haute taille, march on my foots without even to demand par-
don. And of time in time he arrives a mister, who cries, “Now
then, here he is, come along l’ or an employed of the theatre, or
a groom in a “mackintosch’” all wetted, and then the ladys run
after, and they march all on my foots, jusqu'à ce que, just to this
that Isucceed to obtain a cab, and to go myself of it.
One other time I go to the Ópera so bad situated at the middle
of those villain little streets, so dirty, so miserable, and there
also he fall of the rain and fattend ºil one half hour, still more
shoved, bousculé, and f part absolutely the last, at the moment
where the employeds shut the doors. And that after to have
paid twenty and one shillings!
The º time I am gone to see Sir IRVING and Lady TERRY in
this charming comedy of the illustrious SHACKSPIR, Much To Do
About Nothing. I had read her in advance in french, and thus I
hoped to comprehend of her a small little, aided by the jests,
gestes, of these artists so celebrated. The comedy is admirable.
And what put in scene, quelle mise en scènel Superbel. I admire
much Lady TERRY. Šhe plays of a fashion truly ravishing, and
one can not more gracious. Sir IRVING is a at artist, but I
comprehend not one sole word that he says, for he pronounces
not the english as the most part of your compatriots. And what
of lively applauding! I have heard, to say that the claqueur
exists not in England. That comprehends himself when the
assistance applauds so vigourously. At the fine there is so much
of noise that Sir IRVING is forced of to make a little discourse. I
comprehend not one word, but I suppose that he prays the
spectators of to go themselves of it tranquilly. More late one
tells me that Sir Irving thanked the assistance and that it is him
who inaugurated this mode of speaking at the theatre. What droll
of idea! Figure to yourself, Mister Punch, a french actor making

THERE AND BACK WITH A CARD.
DURING a delightfully refreshing Saturday-to-Monday outing
at our dear (in one sense, but reasonable in an argumentum-
ad-pocketum sense) old friend Boulogne-sur-Mer, there came
into our possession a card directing our attention to the South
Eastern Hotel, formerly Hôtel Zeeland, where, judging from the
truly al fresco Parisian style and appearance of its Restauration
in full view of everything that is going on, including the easy
travelling trams, in Boulogne, it ought to be , all that any
traveller's fancy could paint it in two coats of paint, inside and
out, especially as its manager is Monsieur G. FABESCH, late of
the Hôtel Continental, Paris, whom, personally, the present de-
ponent, knoweth not from Mons. ADAM du Jardin de Paradis,
—which is simply Paris “writ large,”—though he has a pleasant
recollection of the aforesaid Parisian Hotel. But it is Manager
Famºsch's card that will delight the idler who has absolutely
nothing to do, after a quite perfect “breakfast at the fork,”
or, as this can't be provided for a mere song let us term it
“breakfast at the fork-out,” in the airy little “Café Restaurant
Garnier, Parc aux huitres,” on the Jetée, except to lazily smoke
the soothing cigar, dawdle with the fragrant coffee and its ac-
companying chasse, and, when not gazing on the merry bathers,
to peruse the literature provided by the aforementioned card. It
speaks as excellent English as THACKERAY's English hero did
French, when, in answer to the inquiry “Quivaldº’’ he, “knowing
the language” answered “Je/* The card announces how “The
S. E. Hotel Co., L.D., London, has purchased a grand site opposite the
Casino and the sea for the purpose of building a Magnificent Hotel
(400 Rooms), but during this Season (1897) they ave decided to open
the existing buildings, which will a commodate about 100 8.”
May we be among those future “guets” whom this hotel is to
“a commodate.” To culinary connoisseurs there are just two
places on the Continong that may rival each other in a reputa-
tion for cuisine, namely, the Restauration at the Gare Maritime,
Calais, and this “Parc aux huitres,” B'logne, which is not to be
excelled, go where you will, except, perhaps—but that it is a bit
too far from England merely for a breakfast—at Monte Carlo.
Mr. Punch's special traveller in the Déjeúnering business
always likes to do a good turn to all who deserve to benefit by a
brief holiday, and now, when the weather is tropical, and the sea
absolutely calm, being fearful of moving violently lest it should
t too hot, now is the time for the aller et retour / to Calais and
ack, to Boulogne and back! et voilà tout!
EXPERIENCES OF AN EARL’S-COURTIER,
So hot and fine to-day that I feel disinclined to work at my
History of English Civilization. Happy thought; why not visit
the “Victorian Era” Show at Earl's Court?' I shall doubtless
collect valuable material there for my book, especially if I go not
in the frivolous spirit of a mere holiday-maker, but in the rever-
ent mood of the anxious seeker after knowledge. Having pro-
vided myself with a large note-book, I start.
Numbers of people passing through turnstiles; it is delightful
to see how wi ..f is the desire to learn as much as possible
about our national progress. First of all I meet some steam-
engines and a large number of curious contrivances which are
not, as I at first supposed, gigantic sewing-machines, but, are
electrical appliances of some kind. Wish I knew more about
them; note them down for special study at a future date. Pass
on, and discover women ing tin match-boxes. S e, I
never realised before how much the greatness of England de-
pended upon the manufacture of these articles. Mustn't forget to
mention tin match-boxes in my chapter on commercial progress.
Other people are cooking sweets and polishing imitation dia-
monds. #. last exhibit is doubtless a satire upon modern
hypocrisy. But I notice they are called “Parisian Diamonds,”
.# wonder vaguely how they illustrate the progress of the
British nation. Now, as it is very hot here, I will sit down in
the garden and write down the results of my observations thus
far. Having done so, turn towards the Panorama, where I
doubtless shall find a vivid presentment of some eventful scene
in our national history. . . . Rather to my surprise, it proves to
be an excellent picture of Ancient Rome. Am not quite certain
at present what it has to do with the Victorian Era, but doubt-
less this is owing to my own stupidity. Next visit the “Living
Photographs.” Having waited about quarter of an hour in
solemn silence, the showman takes pity on us at last. Must
work the pictures of ballet-dancers into my chapter on “National

Recreations.” But I don't quite see how I am to deal with the
circus and the marionettes, so I won’t visit those attractions at
present. Might connect the great wheel, somehow, in a foot-
note, with the Revolution of TÉ. Doubtless those people who
are going up and down on the switchback find that this helps
them to realise the greatness of England, especially as the switch-
back is an American invention.
Passing again into the building, I find myself in a model
hospital ward. Very interesting. Pathetic wax dolls repose in
cots, and are supposed to be suffering from various unpleasant
diseases. And their beautiful complexions, which no doubt are
exactly copied from life, testify in a very striking way to the
progress of medical science. feel sure that sixty years ago
sufferers from diphtheria hadn't such rosy cheeks. By the side
of one of the cots is a splendid model of a nurse, really most
life-like. I wonder if the wax it is made of is very hard. Pinch
its cheek to see, when, to my astonishment and horror, it proves
to be not a wax modeliike the rest, but a real, live, and justly
indignant hospital nurse. I endeavour to explain my. 6,
and retreat hastily. Visit the “Sporting Section,” which seems
to be very popular. Crowds of people are gazing with intense
reverence at a row of shapeless cricket-balls, which, it seems,
have been used in important matches.
Proceed through many other galleries, and inspect an excellent
collection of pictures. Then I return to the garden, sit and
histen to the band, and drink tea. The buns which accompany, it
are interesting relics, and were evidently baked (though the
official guide omits to mention this) at the time of Her MAJESTY's
accession. Afterwards, feel disinclined for exertion, and refuse
to join the unhappy-looking, gentlemen who, clad in top-hats, and
frock-coats, are º: jolted round on elephants. I visit “Old
London,” and learn, for the first time, that, sixty years ago, it
was paved entirely with cobble-stones.
Aſtogether, an excellent show, but somehow I have not learnt
quite as much as I had :. from it about the national
progress of England during the last sixty years!

FAIR shone the evening sun upon the
lists of Bunkum Castle #. upon the
noble features of Sir Hungar pº Mont-
MoRENCY, as, with a deft movement of the
lever, he caused his gallant motor-car to
caracole nimbly in the midst of the arena.
Throughout, the afternoon had he ridden
in the gymkhana, and with such success
that towards the close not one of the
onlookers had dared to venture a ducat
against his chances, partly because his vic-
tory seemed assured, and partly because it
was doubtful whether the lists of Bunkum
were not a “place” within the meaning of
the Act, and the rumour was freely bruited
that more than one member of the Anti-
Gambling League was present in disguise.
S y did Sir Hubert apply the ‘.

angrily, “you may claim as much as you

rigour of the law He is exceeding the
rate of 80 miles an hourl”
But the gallant young knight had dis-
appeared in the distance.
CHAPTER XLI.
Alas! Sir HUBERT had been too impa-
tient in his flight. Scarcely had he
travelled ten miles on his way, when his
supply of oil gave out, and his motor-car
came to a standstill. Leaping down from
his engine, he knocked at the door of the
nearest cottage, to see whether he could
borrow some petroleum. The door was
opened, and, to his amazement, before
him stood the Lady DoRo THEA.!
“My HUBERT!” she exclaimed ; and
rushed into his arms. Then she explained
that, suspecting her father's design in
sending her to London, she had quitted
the train on the first opportunity, and had
taken refuge in this cottage.
“Then we will fly together, my love

dreadful baying of bloodhounds!
“Alack!” said DoRothra; “my father
has taken a hint from one of Dr. ConAN
Doyle's romances, and means to destroy
us by these fearsome beasts!”
Scarcely had she spoken, when two enor-

“County Council's orders,” explained the
unknown, who proved, indeed, to be the
village policeman. “No dogs allowed

“Heaven reward the County Councill”
exclaimed Sir HUBERT. “Having got
some more petroleum, let us fly to my own

and both turned in terror.

CHAPTER XL.
FAIR shone the evenin
lists of Bunkum Castle #. upon the
noble features of Sir Hungar prº Mont-
MoRENCY, as, with a deft movement of the
lever, he caused his gallant motor-car to
caracole nimbly in the midst of the arena.
Throughout the afternoon had he ridden
in the gymkhana, and with such success
that towards the close not one of the
onlookers had dared to venture a ducat
against his chances, partly because his vic-
tory seemed assured, and partly because it
was doubtful whether the lists of Bunkum
were not a “place” within the meaning of
the Act, and the rumour was freely bruited
that more than one member of the Anti-
Gambling League was present in disguise.
Skilfully did Sir Hubert apply the brake
and bring his car to a standstill before the
Marquis of BUNKUM's seat.

“having conquered in all the motor-car
contests, I come, in accord with the best
precedents, to claim the hand of your
daughter, the lovely Lady DoRotREA
FLAPDoodLE.”
“Gadzooks!” answered the Marquis,
angrily, “you may claim as much as you
please, but you're not going to have her.”
“What?” cried Sir HUBERT.
“Sir,” answered the other, “you told
me the other day to buy shares in the
Abracadabra Gold Mines. And by this
evening's paper. I see that the company is
in liquidation l’”
“”Tis false!” shouted Sir HUBERT.
“That paragraph is the work of that sorry
scoundrel, §: MIDAS PLUTOCRAT—”
“Who is about to become my son-in-
law,” said the Marquis of BUNKUM, with a
cruel smile. “I have already despatched
the Lady DoRoth EA to London, and she is
to marry him to-morrow!”
“But—but,” said Sir HUBERT, aghast,
is to entice his present wife into the lethal
chamber at Battersea, and to-morrow he
will marry xx
But Sir HUBERT had turned the lever of
his motor-car to full speed a-head.
“Stop him 1" cried the Marquis, “stop
him osecute him with the utmost
rigour of the lawl He is exceeding the
rate of 80 miles an hourl” -
But the gallant, young knight had dis-
appeared in the distance.
CHAPTER XLI.
Alas! Sir HUBERT had been too impa-
tient in his flight. Scarcely had he
travelled ten miles on his way, when his
supply of oil gave out, and his motor-car
came to a standstill. Leaping down from
his engine, he knocked at the door of the
nearest cottage, to see whether he could
borrow some petroleum. The door was
opened, and, to his amazement, before
him stood the Lady DoRo THEA.!
“My HUBERT!” she exclaimed ; and
rushed into his arms. Then she explained
that, suspecting her father's design in
sending her to London, she had quitted
the train on the first opportunity, and had
taken refuge in this cottage.
“Then we will fly together, my lovel ”
said HUBERT.
“Hark!” quoth DoRothEA,
deadly pale. “What is that ?”
They listened in silence, and heard the
dreadful baying of bloodhounds!
“Alack!” said DoRo THEA; “my father
has taken a hint from one of Dr. ConAN
Doyle's romances, and means to destroy
us by these fearsome beasts!”
Scarcely had she spoken, when two enor-
mous hounds came bounding round the
corner. . But a stalwart figure stepped in
the road, pulled a pistol from his pocket
and—crack! crack!—the beasts lay dea
almost at their feet!
“Noble hero !” exclaimed Sir HUBERT,
rapturously, to the stranger. “How can

DARBY JONES ON GOODWOOD.
WE all know, honoured Sir, the rap-
turous, not to say frivolous, feelings with
which the Troubadour was inspired as he
returned after his trip (doubtless under
the conduct of the antique Cook or GAZE)
to Jerusalem and Joppa, carrying the
banjo of the period. similar tempera-
ment, the Bard and Vates combined jour-
neys to the resplendent Park, wherein,
for a considerable consideration, his Grace

mits the members of the General Public
“our Pollies,” as I once heard a Greek
scholar describe them) to assemble on that
upland course which contributes so richly
to the prosperity of the lowlanders of
Chichester. I look upon the Goodwood
Meeting, Sir, as the final picnic of the
London season, where wearied Duchesses
selves under the trees on viands not to be
despised by those Sybarites of whom we
read at Free Libraries, in works descrip-
tive of classic times. I know nothing so
pleasant as a lunch beneath those beeches.
I believe them to be of that order of trees
which in fair sunshine convert the hillside
into an aristocratic Rosherville Gardens.
The mayonnaise, be it of salmon, lobster,
or the more modest crab, gathered from
the tanks of Hamble by Southampton
Water, seems to have a succulence denied
to the crustaceans to be found in the
shell-fish marts of our Great Metropolis,
while the vintage of champagne cools the
gullet with an extra sparkle of satisfaction.
Perhaps this jubilation of Food may be
accounted for by the brilliant costumes
with which it is surrounded. Lovely in-
deed is this parterre (I trust I have spelt
the word right) of fair women arrayed in
garments which even the Queen of SHEBA
on her celebrated visit to the Emperor o
IsrAEL, could not have rivalled. A Lovely
Lady whom I once knew used to regret
that her sex was not, like the jockeys,
accommodated with an apartment wherein
to change apparel. She assured me that
if any great milliner could contract for
such a room, the metamorphoses would
exceed in one day at Goodwood those
chronicled by the Poet OvID. I quite
believe her, and so, no doubt, do you, Sir.
At the same time, it is only right to
record that, despite Royal and Ducal sur-
roundings, Goodwood is frequented by
bands of the most unscrupulous brigands
ever permitted to exercise an illegitimate
calling. I am not squeamish, and am well-
known at Scotland Yard, but I do aver,
and with feeling (for was f not three years
ago relieved, molens volens (Latin Dictionary

I’ve drawn with eminent success—
My latest task is just as big,
I must confess!
You come to me with book in hand,
And first upon the open page,
Obedient to your command,
I meekly write my name and age.
Next, answer all these questions, eh?
By Jove, I’m in a pretty mess!
My inmost thoughts and tastes, you say,
I must confess!
What are my favourite Christian names?
At any rate, I'll answer that;
Though Rhyme, perhaps, might point to

One ace of trumps, the claims I press

'Tis not distilled from vine or hops,
I drink, I trust without excess,

I must confess!
My favourite game—is grouse. You scoff,
How greedy of me? Ah, I see
The other sort of game—say, golf.
And sport P. Well, ratting does for me !
What quality I most admire
In lovely woman—fickleness,
In man—for wealth a high desire,
I must confess!
Pet hobby ? That should be a hawk—
I speak but as a naturalist—
What nonsense, do you say, Italk?
Well, there, it's—stamps, if you insist.
One last confession now for you,
What I have written, more or less,
Is not conspicuously true,
I must confess!
THE STALL MENDICANT'S WADE MEGUM.
Question. Is not a Stall Mendicant a
lady who stands with a money box at
street corners petitioning for alms?
Answer. Certainly; but the accessories
to her calling—a rug, a chair, a table, and
a placard—must not be overlooked in the
full description.
Q. What is the object of the Stall Men-
dicant in rattling her money box?
A. To attract the attention of the busily
employed to the claims of the charity dis-
Q. Is the character of the charity thus
displayed of any great importance?
A. It is not, if care is taken that it
bears reference to either the sick or the
young.
Q. What is the customary age of the
Stall Mendicant?
A. Usually that classified “uncertain,”
because it is certain to be in the neigh-
bourhood of forty.
Q. But is not the Stall Mendicant some-
times of tender years?
A. Occasionally; and this species is
F. irritating to old gentlemen
urrying to catch a train.
Q. Then the Stall Mendicant can cause
irritation?
A. Assuredly; for her importunities are
frequently unwelcomely familiar, and
chronically out of place.
Q. Are the S Mendicants of comely
appearance?
A. Rarely. As a rule the Stall Mendi-
cant is a spinster who has long ceased to
attract by either charm of manner or
beauty of form or face.
Q. What is the excuse for the Stall
Mendicant's importunities?
A. Charity, which in her case is required
to cover, if not a sin, at least a nuisance.
Q. Can you think of any benefit that
springs from the existence of Stall Mendi-
cants
A. It is possible they may be a blessing
in †: to the editors of daily papers.
Q. In what way?
A. By causing the infuriated public to
write letters of complaint adapted for in-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRoM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 19.
—Often heard of “dragging red herring
across path.” Never fore to-night
witnessed performance. Proceeding most
effective. . It was a Scotch herring,
and the draughtsman was the WEARIsome
WEIR.
House in Committee of Supply; Foreign
vote on; for weeks and months the SQUIRE
of MALwooD, reminiscent of an earlier
statesman, had been publicly “longing to
be at 'em!” PRINCE ARTHUR, with his
sword drawn, stood waiting for the man
of brawn. . Now the lists were open;
trumpets brayed; swords flashed; the
tourney had commenced. Proved an ex-
ceedingly tame affair. SQUIRE seemed to
have exhausted all his ardour in anticipa-
tion. Mindful of one of highest traditions
of British statesmanship, he would not
embarrass Her MAJESTY's Government on
questions of Foreign policy. Only wanted
to know, you know, just as much as it
would be convenient to tell.
GEORGE CURzoN told as little as possible
in speech of half hour's duration. Then
Members went off at a tangent all over
world from Madagascar to the Mediterra-
nean, from Cephalonia to Cyprus, from
Trichinopoly to the Transv ERNEST
BECKETT, dropping in on the Sandwich
Islands, told interesting story of mission-
ary enterprise. These good men, hailing
from United States, have, he averred, de-
posed QUEEN; established a standing
army; compelled everyone to go to
church ; made sleepiness through the
sermon a high crime and misdemeanour;
denounced dancing as the unpardonable
sin.
BECKETT's weird story illustrated by un-
canny effects. . As he spoke the lightning
flashed; the thunder rolled; the lashing
rain was heard through open windows
falling on the courtyard outside. The
startled House, attuned to solemn mood,
The Wearisome One. “Man, it's gettin' pair-
feckly awfu'. I merely rrise tae ventillate the

When SAGE sat down, the WEARIsome
ONE discovered on his legs, looking more
than usually wise. What would be his
subject P. Autonomy in Crete P the Peace
negotiations? the Soudan advance? the
Behring Sea imbroglio P. There was a
rumbling sound. Members thought the
thunder had begun again. It was only
premonition of movement of the hydraulic
machinery whereby, in moments of in-
tense emotion, the WEARIsoME ONE draws
his voice from remote recesses of his boots.
“Mr. LowTHER,” the voice said, in
curdling tones, “I desire to call the atten-
tion of the Committee to a question
affecting Scotch herrings.”
In a moment the House threw off the
sombre mood born of a sultry night. A
peal of merry laughter broke forth. Be-
fore it had subsided PRINCE ARTHUR
moved the closure. The WEARIsoME ONE,
his herring and his string, were hustled off
the pathway, along which public business
moved with merrier pace.

In deference to recommendation of Miners'

his speech. This was LoNDoNDERRY's
opportunity. Seized it to run amuck at
Bill, and thrust viciously at the meek

CONFESSIONS.
FoR you my cudgelled brains have made
Not unreluctant album-rhymes,
For you Dumb Crambo I have played—
Grotesque impromptu pantomimes.
Blindfold for you the unerring pig
I’ve drawn with eminent success—
My latest task is just as big,
I must confess!
You come to me with book in hand,
And first upon the open page,
Obedient to your command,
I meekly write my name and age.
Next, answer all these questions, eh?
By Jove, I’m in a pretty mess!
Myinmost thoughts and tastes, you say,
I must confess!
What are my favourite Christian names?
At any rate, I'll answer that;
Though Rhyme, perhaps, might point to
JAMEs,
Reason approves JEHoshAPHAT.
And as for girls—sweet names abound,
As SARAH, JANE, JEMIMA, BEss,
Yet 'LizER has a winsome sound,
I must confess!
My favourite book? That's rather hard.
One might put first some three or four—
Old FRoissart, or the Immortal Bard,
Or Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour.
But since there’s only in the pack
One ace of trumps, the claims I press
Of WHITAKER, his Almanack,
I must confess!
The colour I love best—is blue,
Which leads appropriately to
The question next, my favourite drink?
'Tis not distilled from vine or hops,
I drink, I trust without excess,
The mild, exhilarating “Kops,”
I must confess!
My favourite game—is grouse. You scoff,
How greedy of me? Ah, I see
The other sort of game—say, golf.
And sport? Well, ratting does for me!
What quality I most admire
In lovely woman—fickleness,
In man—for wealth a high desire,
I must confess!
Pet hobby ? That should be a hawk—
I speak but as a naturalist—
What nonsense, do you say, Italk?
Well, there, it's—stamps, if you insist.
One last confession now for you,
What I have written, more or less,
Is not conspicuously true,
I must confess!
THE STALL MENDIGANT'S WADE MEGUM.
Question. Is not a Stall Mendicant a
lady who stands with a money box at
street corners petitioning for alms?
Answer. Certainly; but the accessories
to her calling—a rug, a chair, a table, and
a placard—must not be overlooked in the
full description.
Q. What is the object of the Stall Men-
dicant in rattling her money box?
A. To attract the attention of the busily
employed to the claims of the charity dis-
Q. Is the character of the charity thus
displayed of any great importance?
A. It is not, if care is taken that it
bears reference to either the sick or the
yCung.
Q. What is the customary age of the
Stall Mendicant?
A. Usually that classified “uncertain,”
because it is certain to be in the neigh-
bourhood of forty.
Q. But is not the Stall Mendicant some-
times of tender years?
A. Occasionally; and this species is
F. irritating to old gentlemen
urrying to catch a train.
Q. Then the Stall Mendicant can cause
irritation?
A. Assuredly; for her importunities are
frequently unwelcomely familiar, and
chronically out of place.
Q. Are the Stall Mendicants of comely
appearance?
A. Rarely. As a rule the Stall Mendi-
cant is a spinster who has long ceased to
attract by either charm of manner or
beauty of form or face.
Q. What is the excuse for the Stall
Mendicant's importunities?
A. Charity, which in her case is required
to cover, if not a sin, at least a nuisance.
Q. Can you think of any benefit that
springs from the existence of Stall Mendi-
cants
A. It is possible they may be a blessing
in º to the editors of daily papers.
Q. In what way?
A. By causing the infuriated public to
write letters of complaint adapted for in-

of MALwood, reminiscent of an earlier

would be convenient to tell.

premonition of movement of the hydraulic

his voice from remote recesses of his boots.
“Mr. LowTHER,” the voice said, in
curdling tones, “I desire to call the atten-

In a moment the House threw off the

OUR ARCHAEOLOGICAL OUTING.
London, July 28, 1897.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-For real, downright giddiness you can't
do better than take a day with the archaeologists, and I therefore
venture to give your readers the benefit of some experiences.
We started—a party of two, in company with other members of
the Society—about ten o'clock yesterday morning, from the ter-
minus of one of the Southern lines, and duly arrived, not more
than a quarter of an hour late, at Six Elms, a pretty country
town some twenty miles from fondon. Here we were met by
some local fellow-workers and other enthusiasts who had flocked
from all parts of the country, to the number of about three
hundred. The first item of the programme was a paper by the
rector on the Parish Church, whither we F. , in order to
..] hear it read. The reverend gentleman, however, was unavoid-
ably absent, and his dissertation was delivered from the pulpit, to
the accompaniment of a thunderstorm, by a clerical substitute.
The congregation—I mean audience—were much impressed by
the j way with which the preacher presented the architectu-
ral details of the address. He generally said “North" when he
meant “South,” and told us that the church was 175 feet long by
56 inches wide, and that the pulpit (meaning the gallery)
ran all round the edifice, and altogether he kept us in a state of
F. and expectant attention. After learning that the pulpit
ad been captured from a neighbouring parish, “the dear rector
having, with his own loving hands, scraped off the paint,” we
made for the “Sceptre Hotel.”
. Here we had a hasty stand-up lunch on , sponge-cakes and
similar etceteras, and then took our places in the eighteen breaks,
which were drawn up in the High Street outside, waiting to take
us to Six Elms Park, a distance of about a mile. We sat for an
hour, before the order to start was given, time apparently bein
no object with archaeologists. When the parson in charge .
found the last lost sheep, and counted us over for the fifteenth
time, the signal was given by dog-whistle, and, like GALILEo's
world, we moved after all. The rustics stood, one-deep, won-
dering what sort of beanfeasters we were anyway, especially as
we had no concertinas, and were forbidden to blow a horn. For
fear of being too modern we Fºl. up at the slightest descent
to apply the skids, which mostly refused to catch. However, we
eventually reached the Tudor mansion without mishap, and
further wait occurred before we were admitted.
After we had been sufficiently reminded of our presumption in
intruding, we were somewhat reluctantly let in through a wicket-
gate by a prehistoric menial. Like a pit-dºor crowd, we streamed
into the second court, where we º in the sun, while a learned
professor discoursed on the history of the place. Of this I re-
member nºthing, except that some antiquarian was called the
“Perambulator” of the county—a delightful designation which
may be recommended to political organisations when they are tired
present titles. Our jaws collectively fell when the announcement
was made that we could only view the inside in parties of
twenty-five, as the floors were unsafe. This was in spite of the
county ball, which had been given there shortly before. The
majority of us therefore waited another two hours in the back-
yard and the garden while, the first two or three parties were
being taken through the three hundred odd rooms. Some, I
regret to say, never saw the bedchamber at all where JAMEs the
First was to have slept but didn't, or the owner's peer's robes,
or any of the other attractions. We had to content ourselves
with a sight of the governess at tea. Then our personal con-
ductor hurried us off to the country seat of the Society's noble
President.
Arriving famished, an hour late, we hastily partook of his hospit
tality, and then skidded back to the “Sceptre.” Here we had
dinner, followed by loyal and local toasts, and much patting on
the back. We wound up the evening in the Public Hall, where a
lecture by an unconscious humourist was in progress, on “Palaeo:
lithic Kitchen Middens.” Slide after slide of split bones, and
what the lecturer termed ovall-headed flint implements, were ex-
hibited on the screen, and were loudly cheered. Too much of
this excitement after dinner might have been bad for the diges-
tion, so we departed apologetically for the station, missing the

amuse himself in full air the evening. But no! Partout some
parks, some gardens, but as restaurant, as coffee concert, there
is but two—the Exhibition at Earl "Court and the ºperial
Institution.
One time I am gone to visit this last. What sad place! I
march by some innumerable gallerys, filled of announces, and of
time in time I demand, “Where finds himself the garden?” As
that I arrive in fine to a court of the most lugubrious, absolutely
that which you call the “backyard” of a house, surrounded of
high walls, where I perceive a crowd of persons, very squeezed,
essaying of to sit themselves on some chairs not enough numerous.
At the middle a “band's stand,” where Mister Strauss and his
orchestra Fº some dances of a ravishing fashion. But what

And these amiable Londonians, who pay some taxes enough great
for to maintain the magnificent Hide Park and the delicious
Kensington Garden, at two steps from there, sit themselves all
tranquilly in this “backyard” without to desire other thing!
One other time I am gone to Earl Court. A friend invites me
to dine at the “Wellcome Club” in the garden of the Exhibition
at eight of clock. That should to be very agreeable by a such heat.
I put myself in habit, I mount in handsome cab, and I say to the

COME FROM THE DOGS–A PROTEST.
MY DEAR MR. Punch,-We all of us look upon you as out
friend, and if our representative on your establishment used,
in days #. by, to bite your nose, he now is entirely respectable.
And if he did bite your nose in those distant times, it was not
from malice, but only in the day's work, or, rather, play.
Well, my dear Sir, as our friend, we ask you to the powers
that be to attention. For the last two or three years we have
been chivied and worried as if we had strayed on to the Derby
course, and were taking, amidst hooting, a preliminary canter.
We have been muzzled and unmuzzled, put under restrictions
here, and left free there. Like the gentleman in the song, “We
don't know where we are.”
And now comes a crowning annoyance. If we leave England,
to follow our people on the Continent, we are to be put in
quarantine before we are permitted to return
I see that some of our friends are declaring that at the next
election they will turn the Ministry out if the Ministry don't get
us in 1 Quite right I Love me, love my dog. They had better
be warned in time or else there will be what I have the honour
to sign myself, A NICE Bow-wow.
THE USE OF USURY.
(Supplementary Letters.)
Post-mark—St. James's.
SIR,--I think the money-lender should not only be prevented
from taking more than three per cent. (on the model of the old
interest for Consols) for his money, but should also be required
to give substantial security to the borrower. If some such regu-
lation as this were put in force I should not have to sign myself,
ONE IN sad NEED of A PALTRY FIVER,
Post-mark—Boulogne.
SIR,--It is obvious that money-lenders should be forced to pay
not only the principal but the interest of the money advanced.
A person who requires cash, and applies to a usurer, is nearly
always as innocent as a lamb, and quite unable to cope with the
arts of the wily dealer. He requires the protection of the law.
Why not make loans unrecoverable? That would simplify matters
Post-mark—Mayfair.
SIR,--I have run through three fortunes, and for more than a
quarter of a century have been a child of nature. How can I
bother about the repayment of cash advanced? As my sire used to
say, “Dem it!” Yours truly, MANTALINI THE YouNGER.
Post-mark—Regent's Park.
SIR,--I want money, and I am very frivolous. Well, when 1
want money, I will sign anything. . Now, isn't it a shame that
when I do get money I should be asked to repay it? It is most
provoking! And I growl about it. Yes, I do! But, in spite
of my frivolity, I have my head screwed on more or less, the right
way, and know what I am about. So when I am asked to repay
money borrowed at thirty or forty per cent, I promise to create
a rumpus, and after having a loan, am left alone. See the joke?
They on't." Yours sincerely, QUITE A CLEveR LITTLE THING.
Post-mark—Fleet Street.
SIR,-Of course usury is detestable, but those who borrow are
not all saints, and consequently there may be something to be
said on the other side. Yours sincerely, CoMMon SENSE.
THE WAC. AND ITS WACUUM.
Mr. Punch, SIR,-As the acknowledged organ of the legal pro-
fession, will you permit me to address you? I notice that the
question of the duration of the Long Vacation recently attracted
the attention of the solicitors. It seems to me that the initiative
should have emanated from the Bar. And it is to mend this fault
that I am writing to you.
I have thought the matter over very carefully, and have come
to the conclusion that the proposed curtailment of the vacation
would be of little service to the class I have the honour to repre-
sent. Taking myself as a type of a class, I can say that the
premature commencement of the Term would have no appreciable
effect upon my finances. I have read my fee-book (my admirable
and excellent clerk, PontingtoN, checking the entries), and for
the last twenty years I find the average precisely the same. So
by no means curtail the vacation on our account.

$9 many of gardens, so many of squares, that he would believe
himself of aboard, d'abord, in the city the best arranged for to
amuse himself in full air the evening. But no! Partout some
parks, some gardens, but as restaurant, as coffee concert, there
is but two—the Exhibition at Earl Court and the Imperial
Institution.
One time I am gone to visit this last. What sad place! I
march by some innumerable gallerys, filled of announces, and of
time in time I demand, “Where finds himself the garden?” As
that I arrive in fine to a court of the most lugubrious, absolutely
that which you call the “backyard” of a house, surrounded of
high walls, where I perceive a crowd of persons, very squeezed,
essaying of to sit themselves on some chairs not enough numerous.
At the middle a “band's stand,” where Mister STRAuss and his
orchestra Fº some dances of a ravishing fashion. But what
garden garden in brick, shut up, absolutely without air.
And these amiable Londonians, who pay some taxes enough great
for to maintain the magnificent Hide Park and the delicious
Kensington Garden, at two steps from there, sit themselves all
tranquilly in this “backyard” without to desire other thing!
One other time I am gone to Earl Court. A friend invites me
to dine at the “Wellcome Club" in the garden of the Exhibition
at eight of clock. That should to be very agreeable by a such heat.
I put myself in habit, I mount in handsome cab, and I say to the
coacher, “The Exhibition.” “Erlskt,” says he, *ouitchentrinssº
I comprehend not, and therefore I say, “Earl Court.” “Raitcha,

After a course enormously long we arrive, I pay to him three
shillings six pennys, and I enter by a narrow door. That
astonishes me not, for I recall to myself the entry of the national
Museum of South Kensington. He makes very hot and I march
very far until to this that I arrive to a staircase. I find there
an employed, and I say to him, “Is it that I shall arrive soon to
the Exhibition?” “Nottir,” responds to me he, “other side,

An admission was made to that effect.
“Then, they should be replaced,” was
the decisive rejoinder.
“It may some time. It will be
necessary to apply for others.”
“Have you no forms?”
“Certainly. But the cost of the print-
ing, the price of the postage, the time of
weary waiting?”
“Are nought,” was the prompt response.
And then the Inspecting Official took his
departure to perform his duties elsewhere.
And so the necessary application was
made, and after a while—a rather lon
while—the new ones were received, an
work was resumed with the former vigour.
But the matter was not to rest there.
If there was one thing abhorrent to the
Board, it was waste, and that this severed
pair, useless in their present condition,
should be left on the premises, perhaps to
rust, perchance to be mislaid, was not to
be tºlerated for a moment. So the proper
machinery was called to the assistance of
the Board, and all went as merrily as a
marriage bell.
After the others had been in use for
some time, a waggon harnessed to a pair
of horses appeared in front of the tempo-
rary resting-place of the discarded ones.
“Are they ready ?”
ance of a single supplementary porter the
damaged articles were carried carefull
into the waggon, the horses started off,
and the equipage with its valuable burden
disappeared.
Then there were congratulations all
round, for every one connected with the
Board considered that all had been done
that should have been accomplished.
“But what has the fuss been about P”
asked a ratepayer, who from the first had
taken an interest in the complicated pro-
ceedings.
Then came the explanation. A pair of
scissors having been discovered to be dam-
aged, new ones had replaced them, and
the original piece of cutlery had been
returned into store.

And, don't reckon with friendship and

Of a club with an Admiralty warrant;
But the “Minder” has eyes that can see
And a manner that's gressly abhorrent.

In a way that is most democratic;
Why, the skipper he'd treat as a slave
And a salt, who is far from the Attic
But the skipper is one of the sort
That perk up at a land-lubber's bawling,

HOW THE MONEY GOES.
(A Legend of the School Board, founded on fact.)
THERE was t excitement. The In-
specting Official had discovered the imper-
fection. The Head of the Department was
ready with an explanation.
“They had come undone.”
“I see,” said the Inspecting Official.
“And now they are useless?”
An admission was made to that effect.
“Then they should be replaced,” was
the decisive rejoinder.
“It may e some time. It will be
necessary to apply for others.”
“Have you no forms?”
“Certainly. But the cost of the print-
ing, the price of the postage, the time of
weary waiting?”
“Are nought,” was the prompt response.
And then the Inspecting Official took his
departure to perform his É. elsewhere.
And so the necessary application was
made, and after a while—a rather lon
while—the new ones were received, an
work was resumed with the former vigour.
But the matter was not to rest there.
If there was one thing abhorrent to the
Board, it was waste, and that this severed
pair, useless in their present condition,
should be left on the premises, perhaps to
rust, perchance to be mislaid, was not to
be tºlerated for a moment. So the proper
machinery was called to the assistance of
the Board, and all went as merrily as a
marriage bell.
After the others had been in use for
some time, a waggon harnessed to a pair
of horses appeared in front of the tempo-
rary resting-place of the discarded ones.
“Are they ready?”
ance of a single supplementary porter the
damaged articles were carried º
into the waggon, the horses started off,
and the equipage with its valuable burden
disappeared.
Then there were congratulations all
round, for every one connected with the
Board considered that all had been done
that should have been accomplished.
“But what has the fuss been about P”
asked a ratepayer, who from the first had
taken an interest in the complicated pro-
ceedings.
Then came the explanation. A pair of
scissors having been discovered to be dam-
aged, new ones had replaced them, and
the original piece of cutlery had been
returned into store.

FIGHTING CAPACITY |
A Battleship and two
what PRINCE ARTHUR, following the
SQUIRE of MALwood in discussion,
pointedly alluded to as “a hot night.”
WALRoND and ANSTRUTHER, rare visi-
tants to Treasury Bench, sat huddled to-
gether at Gangway end in amaze. It
wasn't one of your snippetty speeches in
Committee. Rather it was a well-informed,
clearly thought out, forcibly argued, ad-
mirably delivered, denunciation of the
Bishops and all their works in relation to
education. Once ToMLINson, thinking
that, whilst a Whip was omnipotent in
the Lobby, he was of no account in the
House, interposed a contradiction. Be-
fore Member for Preston quite knew where
he was, he was prone on his back, and
kicked aside so that he might not impede
progress. All done in a minute. No one
more astonished than ToMLINson.
“This won’t do, you know,” said WAL-
RoND, gloomily regarding the Opposition
Whip. “These fellows mustn't have it all
their own way. Tell you what, Bob ; in-
stead of going up to Scotland for the 12th,
you must go into training; come out next
Session as a first-class debater; take all
the shine out of ToM ELLIs. What do you
think?”
“It would be very nice,” said ANSTRU-
THER, successfully repressing enthusiasm
at the prospect. “But don't you think
that degree has something to do with it?
You know he sneaked off up to Oxford the
other Saturday, and took his M.A.”
“Very well, Bob,” said the Ministerial
Whin to his esteemed junior, “you shall
do the same. We’re not going to be beat
for a trifle like that. So just arrange it.”
Business done.—Oyster divided between
Elementary Schools. Voluntary Schools
get the oyster (£619,000); Board Schools
the shell (£91,000).
Friday. — Best thing about Foreign
Prison-made Goods Bill is WALLACE's
speech in moving rejection on third read-
ing. Almost boisterously humorous, with
some flashes of wit, and much solid
argument.
“And to think,” SARK says, “that at
one time WALLACE wanted to get an ap-
pointment as a coroner! He wouldn't be
safe in such a position. Any corpse in
which remained the slightest sense of
Cruisers. Mr. G-ch-n, Mr. M-c-rtn-y, Mr. A. Ch-mb-rl-n.
as he charged the jury. And that, you
know, would never do.”
House grateful to Member who in these
closing days of long Session, can keep up
his spirits. But outburst had no effect on
fortunes of Bill. House listened, laughed,
and, by majority of more than two to one,
read the Bill a third time.
Business done.—Everything the Govern-
ment put forward.
THE LAY OF THE GREAT AUK's ECG.
[A slightly cracked specimen was sold, on July 27,
to Mr. MIDDLEBRook for 160 guineas—“a ridi-
culous price for such an egg as this,” as the auc-
tioneer observed.]
OH ! talk not to me of Klondyke,
Coolgardie, Peru, or the Rand;
As investments they’re failures alike,
Compared with the latest to hand!
But give me the egg of the auk,
The great auk—I ask for no more;
When it’s cracked, they can fill it with
chalk
Till it fetches its weight in gold ore.
There are only just threescore and ten
Of such eggs in existence to-day,
And no longer a live specimen
Of the fowl any further to lay !
Each egg has a long pedigree
Drawn up from the date of its birth;
They'll be smashed, till at last there will be
But one on the face of the earth.
Ah! then, if that egg were but mine,

An unlimited boom to promote!
I would turn myself into a Trust."

The market we'd nicely adjust,
While the public would rush to sub-

The world, I am sure, would take shares
In my single and marvellous egg;

And reduce them to work or to beg'
Alas! it is merely a dream—
For I haven't the guineas to spend

ENDETH THE FIRST LEsson
ON THE RIVER,
(Page from the Diary of a Sweet Girl Clubbist.)
Monday.—Very pleased I have been chosen for the boat. So
glad to have been taken before AMY and BLANCHE. I am sure I
shall look better than either of them. They needn't have been
so disagreeable about it. AMY asking for her racquet back, and
BLANCHE refusing to lend me her cloak with the feather trim-
mings. FANNY should make a first-rate stroke, and Kate a
model coach.
Tuesday.—We were to have practice to-day, but postponed it
to decide on our colours. Blouses are to be left optional, but
we are all to wear the same caps. We had a terrible fight over
it. FANNY, Rose and I are blonde, so naturally we want light
blue. HENRIETTA is a brunette, and (selfish thing!) stood out
for yellow! However, we settled it amicably at last by choosing
—as a compromise—pink. Then I made a capital suggestion,
which pleased everybody immensely. Instead of caps we are to
wear picture-hats.
Wednesday.—Went out in our boat for the first time. Such a
fight for places! I managed to secure bow, which is the long way
the best seat, as you lead the procession. Everybody sees you
first, and it is most important that the crew should create a
ood impression. HENRIETTA wanted the position, and said that
er brother had told her that the lightest girl should always be
bow. I replied “quite right, and as I had lighter hair than hers,
and my eyes were blue and hers brown, of course it should be
me.” FANNY and Rose agreed with me, and KATB (who was
annoyed at not being consulted enough) placed her five. HeN-
RIETTA was in such a rage'
Thursday.—We are in training! Think it rather nonsense.
Why should we give up meringues and sponge-cakes? And as
to cigarettes, that isn't really a privation, as none of us really
like them. A mile's run isn't bad, but it wears out one's
shoes terribly. KATE wanted us all to drink stout, but we re-
fused. We have compromised it by taking fleur d'orange mixed
with soda-water instead. The Turkish bath is rather long, but
#. can read a novel after the douche. Take it altogether, per-
aps training is rather fun. Still, I think it, as I have already
said, nonsense, especially in regard to sponge-cakes and meringues.
Friday.—Spent the whole of the morning in practising starts.
Everybody disagreeable—KATE absolutely rude. Fancy wantin
me to put down my parasoll And then HENRIETTA (spitefu
creature!) declaring that I didn't keep my eye on the steering
(we have lost our coxswain—had to pay a visit to some people in
the country) because I would look at the people on the banks!
And, KATE backing her up!, I was very angry indeed. So I
didn't come to practice in the afternoon, saying I had a bad
headache, and went instead to Flora's five o'clock tea.
Saturday.—The day of the race! Everybody in great spirits,
and looking their best. Even HENRIETTA was nice. Our pic-
ture-hats were perfectly beautiful. FANNY came out, with ad-
ditional feathers, which wasn't quite fair. But she said, as she
was “stroke" she ought to be different from the rest. And as it
was too late to have the hat altered we submitted. We started,
and got on beautifully; . I saw lots, of people I knew on the
towing-path, and waved to them. And just because I dropped
hold of my oar as we got within ten yards of the winning-post
they all said it was my fault we lost! Who ever heard the like?
The crew are a spiteful set of ugly frumps, and on my solemn
word I won't row any more! Yes, it's no use asking me, as I
say I won't, and I will stick to it. There!
CONSTANTINopLE witH A “No." AND A “YES."
(Page from a Turkish Diary—last week's date.)
Monday.—Received a suggestion that the frontier should be
fixed as arranged by the military experts. The ambassadors most
desirous that I should consent to the arrangement. Plans capi-
tally executed, and descriptive matter, very good indeed. Most
delighted to look over it. Understand I am expected to give a
reply. Certainly, most reasonable. Only too pleased. Would do
so at once, but unfortunately promised to inspect a set of ivory
chessmen, so must postpone the frontier matter to another day.
Tuesday.—Pressing invitation from the ambassadors to settle
up. Certainly, only too pleased. Have again inspected plans
and letterpress. Most interesting. Quite like a second reading.
Very reasonable to ask for my decision. And the invitation
polite in every respect. Would certainly decide at once, but,
unluckily, promised to take a boat on the Bosphorus, Friend of
mine desires to see the sun shining on the water. Don't like to
ºppoint him. So must postpone the frontier matter to another
ay.
Wednesday.—The ambassadors still urgent. They must have
very little to do to make such a fuss about a trifle. However,
from their point of view they are right. And I am so willing to
oblige them. Only too rejoiced to oblige anyone, especially the
ambassadors. Would do it at once, but, to tell the truth, fancy
I arranged to see someone or other. So cannot be rude. Must
attend to him or her as the case may be. So must postpone the
frontier matter to another day.
Thursday.—The ambassadors are becoming quite an institu-
tion. Still anxious about their maps and plans. Had a good
look at them. So very nicely done. And so easily understood.
Of course, glad to oblige representatives of fellow sovereigns.
Would write at once, but rather an inclination to a headache.
Never can attend to business when this happens. So must post-
pone the frontier matter to another day.
Friday.—As I expected, another communication from the
ambassadors. They are distinctly pushing. Still, they are right.
Of course, it would be better if we could arrive at a settlement.
And everything so simple. Maps and letterpress as clear as
crystal. Admirable scheme. Nothing objectionable. Would cer-
tainly agree to it if I had not a prior engagement. Truth to tell,
I have got a toothache—or, rather, what may become a toothache
if I am not careful. So must postpone the frontier matter to
another occasion.
Saturday.—Customary call of the ambassadors. Actually saw
them this time. Most delightful people, every one of them.
Seized the opportunity of their visit to offer them, orders in
brilliants. Fully discussed the scheme. Most reasonable. . Most
excellent! Would certainly have settled it on the spot had I not
remembered I had an important fixture. Must have my hair cut.
Sunday-Change of front. Had a most amusing game, for the
last three weeks or a month. Foreign papers always talking of

“to-morrow” comes. In the meanwhile, settled everything, or

Bishops and all their works in relation to
education. Once ToMLINson, thinking
that, whilst a Whip was omnipotent in
the Lobby, he was of no account in the

fore Member for Preston quite knew where
he was, he was prone on his back, and
kicked aside so that he might not impede

more astonished than ToMLINson.

Whip. “These fellows mustn't have it all
their own way. Tell you what, BoB ; in-
stead of going up to Scotland for the 12th,

Session as a first-class debater; take all

THER, successfully repressing enthusiasm

THE LAY OF THE GREAT AUK'S EGG.
[A slightly cracked specimen was sold, on July 27,
to Mr. MIDDLEBRook for 160 guineaw—“a ridi-

tioneer observed.]

But give me the egg of the auk,
The great auk—I ask for no more ;
When it’s cracked, they can fill it with
chalk
Till it fetches its weight in gold ore.
There are only just threescore and ten
Of such eggs in existence to-day,
And no longer a live specimen

A SAD}FACT.
Impudent Choir-boy (to our Vicar, who is “teaching himself”). “HERE
ENDETH THE FIRST LEsson '"
ON THE RIVER,
(Page from the Diary of a Sweet Girl Clubbist.)
Monday.—Very pleased I have been chosen for the boat. So
glad to have been taken before AMY and BLANCHE. I am sure I
shall look better than either of them. They needn't have been
so disagreeable about it. AMY asking for her racquet back, and
BLANche refusing to lend me her cloak with the feather trim-
mings. FANNY should make a first-rate stroke, and Kate a
model coach.
Tuesday.—We were to have practice to-day, but postponed it
to decide on our colours. Blouses are to be left optional, but
we are all to wear the same caps. We had a terrible fight over
it. FANNY, Rose and I are blonde, so naturally we want light
blue. HENRIETTA is a brunette, and (selfish thing!) stood out
for yellow ! However, we settled it amicably at last by choosing
—as a compromise—pink. Then I made a capital suggestion,
which pleased everybody immensely. Instead of caps we are to
wear picture-hats.
Wednesday.—Went out in our boat for the first time. Such a
fight for places! I managed to secure bow, which is the long way
the best seat, as you lead the procession. Everybody sees you
first, and it is most important that the crew should create a
ood impression. HENRIETTA wanted the position, and said that
er brother had told her that the lightest girl should always be
bow. I replied “quite right, and as I had lighter hair than hers,
and my eyes were blue and hers brown, of course it should be
me.” FANNY and Rose ed with me, and KATB (who was
annoyed at not being consulted enough) placed her five. HEN-
RIETTA was in such a rage
Thursday.—We are in training! Think it rather nonsense.
Why should we give up meringues and sponge-cakes? And as
to cigarettes, that isn't really a privation, as none of us really
like them. A mile's run isn't bad, but it wears out one's
shoes terribly. KATE wanted us all to drink stout, but we re-
fused. We have compromised it by taking fleur d'orange mixed
with soda-water instead. The Turkish bath is rather long, but
ou can read a novel after the douche. Take it altogether, per-
#. training is rather fun. Still, I think it, as I have already
said, nonsense, especially in regard to sponge-cakes and meringues.
Friday.—Spent the whole of the morning in practising starts.
Everybody disagreeable—KATE absolutely rude. Fancy wantin
me to put down my parasol! And then HENRIETTA (spitefu
creature!) declaring that I didn't keep my eye on the steering
(we have lost our coxswain—had to pay a visit to some people in
the country) because I would look at the people on the banks!
And KATE backing her up!, I was very angry indeed. So I
didn't come to practice in the afternoon, saying I had a bad
headache, and went instead to Flora's five o'clock tea.
Saturday.—The day of the race! Everybody in great spirits,
and looking their best. Even HENRIETTA was nice. Our pic-
ture-hats were perfectly beautiful. FANNY came out, with ad-
ditional feathers, which wasn't quite fair. But she said, as she
was “stroke "she ought to be different from the rest. And as it
was too late to have the hat altered we submitted. We started,
and got on beautifully; . I saw lots, of people I knew on the
towing-path, and waved to them. And just because I dropped
hold of my oar as we got within ten yards of the winning-post
they all said it was my fault we lost! Who ever heard the like?
The crew are a spiteful set of ugly frumps, and on my solemn
word I won’t row any more! Yes, it's no use asking me, as I
say I won't, and I will stick to it. There!
CONSTANTINOPLE witH A “No." AND A “YES."
(Page from a Turkish Diary—last week's date.)
Monday.—Received a suggestion that the frontier should be
fixed as arranged by the military experts. The ambassadors most
desirous that I should consent to the arrangement. Plans capi-
tally executed, and descriptive matter very good indeed. Most
delighted to look over it. Understand I am expected to give a
reply. Certainly, most reasonable. Only too pleased. Would do
so at once, but unfortunately promised to inspect a set of ivory
chessmen, so must postpone the frontier matter to another day.
Tuesday.—Pressing invitation from the ambassadors to settle
up. Certainly, only too pleased. Have again inspected plans
and letterpress. Most interesting. Quite like a second reading.
Very reasonable to ask for my decision. And the invitation
polite in every respect. Would certainly decide at once, but,
unluckily, promised to take a boat on the Bosphorus. Friend of
mine desires to see the sun shining on the water. Don't like to
disappoint him. So must postpone the frontier matter to another
ay.
Wednesday.—The ambassadors still urgent. They must have
very little to do to make such a fuss about a trifle. However,
from their point of view they are right. And I am so willing to
oblige them. Only too rejoiced to oblige anyone, especially the
ambassadors. Would do it at once, but, to tell the truth, fancy
I arranged to see someone or other. So cannot be rude. Must
attend to him or her as the case may be. So must postpone the
frontier matter to another day.
Thursday.—The ambassadors are becoming quite an institu-
tion. Still anxious about their maps and plans. Had a good
look at them. So very nicely done. And so easily understood.
Of course, glad to oblige representatives of fellow sovereigns.
Would write at once, but rather an inclination to a headache.
Never can attend to business when this happens. So must post-
pone the frontier matter to another day.
Friday.—As I expected, another communication from the
ambassadors. They are distinctly pushing. Still, they are right.
Of course, it would be better if we could arrive at a settlement.
And everything so simple. Maps and letterpress as clear as
crystal. Admirable scheme. Nothing objectionable. Would cer-
tainly agree to it if I had not a prior engagement. Truth to tell,
I have got a toothache—or, rather, what may become a toothache
if I am not careful. So must postpone the frontier matter to
another occasion.
Saturday.—Customary call of the ambassadors. Actually saw
them this time. Most delightful people, every one of them.
Seized the opportunity of their visit to offer them, orders in
brilliants. Fully discussed the scheme. Most reasonable. . Most
excellent! Would certainly have settled it on the spot had I not
remembered I had an important fixture. Must have my hair cut.
Sunday.—Change of front. Had a most amusing game, for the
last three weeks or a month. Foreign papers always talking of
*to-morrow.” Well, all will be ready by “to-morrow”—when
“to-morrow” comes. In the meanwhile, settled everything, or

THE LAY OF THE GREAT AUK's ECG.
[A slightly cracked specimen was sold, on Julv 27,
to Mr. Middle BRook for 160 guineas—“a ridi-
culous price for such an egg as this,” as the auc-
tioneer observed.]
OH ! talk not to me of Klondyke,
Coolgardie, Peru, or the Rand;
As investments they’re failures alike,
Compared with the latest to hand!
But give me the egg of the auk,
The great auk—I ask for no more;
When it’s cracked, they can fill it with
chalk
Till it fetches its weight in gold ore.
There are only just threescore and ten
Of such eggs in existence to-day,
And no longer a live specimen
Of the fowl any further to lay !
Each egg has a long pedigree
Drawn up from the date of its birth;
They'll be smashed, till at last there will be
But one on the face of the earth.
Ah! then, if that egg were but mine,
My treasure at once I would float
In the City—the chance would be fine
An unlimited boom to promotel
I would turn myself into a Trust."
With a Board and the rest of the Tribe;
The market we'd nicely adjust,
While the public would rush to sub-

The world, I am sure, would take shares
In my single and marvellous egg;
I’d buy up the arch-millionaires,
And reduce them to work or to beg'
Alas! it is merely a dream—
For I haven't the guineas to spend
At these auk-tions (ahem'), and my

A SAD}FACT.
Impudent Choir-boy (to our Vicar, who is “teaching himself”). “HERE
ENDETH THE FIRST LEsson 1"
ON THE RIVER,
(Page from the Diary of a Sweet Girl Clubbist.)
Monday.—Very pleased I have been chosen for the boat. So
glad to have been taken before AMY and BLANCHE. I am sure I
shall look better than either of them. They needn't have been
so disagreeable about it. AMy asking for her racquet back, and
BLANche refusing to lend me her cloak with the feather trim-
mings. FANNY should make a first-rate stroke, and Kate a
model coach.
Tuesday.—We were to have practice to-day, but postponed it
to decide on our colours. Blouses are to be left optional, but
we are all to wear the same caps. We had a terrible fight over
it. FANNY, Rose and I are blonde, so naturally we want light
blue. HENRIETTA is a brunette, and (selfish thing!) stood out
for yellow ! However, we settled it amicably at last by choosing
—as a compromise—pink. Then I made a capital suggestion,
which pleased everybody immensely. Instead of caps we are to
wear picture-hats.
Wednesday.—Went out in our boat for the first time. Such a
fight for places! I managed to secure bow, which is the long way
the best seat, as you lead the procession. Everybody sees you
first, and it is most important that the crew should create a
ood impression. HENRIETTA wanted the position, and said that
er brother had told her that the lightest girl should always be
bow. I replied “quite right, and .." had lighter hair than hers,
and my eyes were blue and hers brown, of course it should be
me.” FANNY and Rose agreed with me, and KATE (who was
annoyed at not being consulted enough) placed her five. HeN-
RIETTA was in such a rage
Thursday.—We are in training! Think it rather nonsense.
Why should we give up meringues and sponge-cakes? And as
to cigarettes, that isn't really a privation, as none of us really
like them. A mile's run isn't bad, but it wears out one's
shoes terribly. KATE wanted us all to drink stout, but we re-
fused. We have compromised it by taking fleur d'orange mixed
with soda-water instead. The Turkish bath is rather long, but
#. can read a novel after the douche. Take it altogether, per-
aps training is rather fun. Still, I think it, as I have already
said, nonsense, especially in regard to sponge-cakes and meringues.
Friday.—Spent the whole of the morning in practising starts.
Everybody disagreeable—KATE absolutely rude. Fancy wantin
me to put down my parasoll And then HENRIETTA (spitefu
creature!) declaring that I didn't keep my eye on the steering
(we have lost our coxswain—had to pay a visit to some people in
the country) because I would look at the people on the banks!
And, KATE backing her up!, I was very angry indeed. So I
didn't come to practice in the afternoon, saying I had a bad
headache, and went instead to Flora's five o'clock tea.
Saturday.—The day of the race! Everybody in great spirits,
and looking their best. Even HENRIETTA was nice. Our pic-
ture-hats were perfectly beautiful. FANNY came out, with ad-
ditional feathers, which wasn't quite fair. But she said, as she
was “stroke "she ought to be different from the rest. And as it
was too late to have the hat altered we submitted. We started,
and got on beautifully; . I saw lots, of people I knew on the
towing-path, and waved to them. And just because I dropped
hold of my oar as we got within ten yards of the winning-post
they all said it was my fault we lost! Who ever heard the like?
The crew are a spiteful set of ugly frumps, and on my solemn
word I won't row any more! Yes, it's no use asking me, as I
say I won't, and I will stick to it. There!
constanTINopLE witH A “No” AND A “YES."
(Page from a Turkish Diary—last week's date.)
Monday.—Received a suggestion that the frontier should be
fixed as arranged by the military experts. The ambassadors most
desirous that I should consent to †. arrangement. Plans capi-
tally executed, and descriptive matter very good indeed. Most
delighted to look over it. Understand I am expected to give a
reply. Certainly, most reasonable. Only too pleased. Would do
so at once, but unfortunately promised to inspect a set of ivory
chessmen, so must postpone the frontier matter to another day.
Tuesday.—Pressing invitation from the ambassadors to settle
up, , Certainly, only too pleased. Have again inspected plans
and letterpress. Most interesting. Quite like a second reading.
Very reasonable to ask for my decision. And the invitation
polite in every respect. Would certainly decide at once, but,
unluckily, promised to take a boat on the Bosphorus. Friend of
mine desires to see the sun shining on the water. Don't like to
ºppoint him. So must postpone the frontier matter to another
ay.
Wednesday.—The ambassadors still urgent. They must have
very little to do to make such a fuss about a trifle. However,
from their point of view they are right. And I am so willing to
oblige them. Only too rejoiced to oblige anyone, especially the
ambassadors. Would do it at once, but, to tell the truth, fancy
I arranged to see someone or other. So cannot be rude. Must
attend to him or her as the case may be. So must postpone the
frontier matter to another day.
Thursday.—The ambassadors are becoming quite an institu-
tion. Still anxious about their maps and plans. Had a good
look at them. So very nicely done. And so easily understood.
Of course, glad to oblige representatives of fellow sovereigns.
Would write at once, but rather an inclination to a headache.
Never can attend to business when this happens. So must post-
pone the frontier matter to another day.
Friday.—As I expected, another communication from the
ambassadors. They are distinctly pushing. Still, they are right.
Of course, it would be better if we could arrive at a settlement.
And everything so simple. Maps and letterpress as clear as
crystal. Admirable scheme. Nothing objectionable. Would cer-
tainly agree to it if I had not a prior engagement. Truth to tell,
I have got a toothache—or, rather, what may become a toothache
if I am not careful. So must postpone the frontier matter to
another occasion.
Saturday.—Customary call of the ambassadors. Actually saw
them this time. Most delightful people, every one of them.
Seized the opportunity of their visit to offer them orders in
brilliants. Fully discussed the scheme. Most reasonable. . Most
excellent! Would certainly have settled it on the spot had I not
remembered I had an important fixture. Must have my hair cut.
Sunday.—Change of front. Had a most amusing game.for the
last three weeks or a month. Foreign papers always talking of
“to-morrow.” Well, all will be ready by “to-morrow”—when
“to-morrow” comes. In the meanwhile, settled everything, or
nearly. With the emphasis on the nearly'

AUGUSTE EN ANGLETERRE.
THE SUNDAY AT LoNDON.
DEAR MistER,-See there that which is absolutely the black
beast of the stranger in an hotel of London However, I find
that the sunday is not so terrible if one knows the Ropes, as one
says in english. I ignore the origin of this saying, but I suppose
that this is the name of some family, and that this wishes to say
that he must to have some friends. Even the sunday at London
is supportable when one has some acquaintances in the town. By
blue, the stranger must not to walk himself in the Fleet Street or
in the Strand Street! There in effect one sees but a town of
closed magazines of same in the “Westend.” At the month of
. he must to go to the Hide Park, where the beautiful misses
and the very correct misters walk themselves under the trees.
But in summer, when he makes hot, he must to quit the great
town the sunday. See there the occasion of to accompany the
family RoPE on the Thames. Not at London, ah but no l Nor
in descending the river towards Southend or Gravend. He
must to go in amount, en amont, to make a walk in boat at
Coockham, at Maidenhed, or at Henly. There what charming
places for to make “un pique-nique,” french word that one may
to translate in english, a repast in full air at the country—in
italian, una merenda al fresco. In verity at London at the month
of july one desires much to repose himself at the fresh, au frais.
And on the Thames the invited stranger finds that which is most
agreeable in summer, eau fraîche au frais aur frais de—de la
famille RoPE, par exemple.
In effect a sojourn at the border of the Thames costs enough
dear. The millionnaire sole can to possess a palace and a park.
For those who are less rich, there is all sorts of houses, the house
of country, the cottage, and the “bungallo.” Also, floating on
the river, the boat-house. Others, who inhabit London, have
but a boat of agreement, bateau d'agrément—a canoe, canot, by
º-and amuse themselves to pass some hours therein the
Sunday.
One sunday of the last month me I am gone as that with some
friends. I traverse the streets all desert and I arrive to the
station of Paddingtown about ten of clock twenty. What of
some misters, each one dressed of one trouser of flannel, vetu
d’un pantalon de flanelle. Partout some hats of straw ; not one
sole hat high of form. And this at London the sunday !
My friends and me we go to the station of Burn End. It is a
name enough interesting. I have heard to speak of the ancient
legend of to put the fire to the Thames. Evidently it is here that
the incendy of the river is finished, at Burn End. But, though
the name is ancient, the village is all beating new, tout battant
neuf-some little modern houses at the middle of some lands to
sell. What drolls of little houses! From the station we go
direct at, chez, the boater to seek the canoe of my friends. . We
are six. The two English love much the exercises of the body
and are great amateurs du canotage. Me by this great heat I
repose myself of preference. Thus, the canoe being ready, we
embark ourselves all the six, my two male friends putting them-
selves to row with great vigour, the three ladys sitting them-
selves, and me reposing myself at the stern. I am a little
incommoded by the paniers du pique-nique, but I think not to it
when we are in road, the air being so fresh, the sky almost blue,
and my friends so gay, so amiable. As that we go to some
distance at the beyond of Marlow and in fine we arrest ourselves
for the lunch.
We eat at our ease at the shelter of the foliage, and after that
the men smoke. By pleasantery I offer a cigarette to one of the
ladys. Sapristi, she accepts her! An english miss who smokes
a cigarette even at the country! More late I find that she is
“new-woman,” young enthusiast of the “mouvement féministe”
in England. Tiens, c'est dróle!
Then we descend the river. The canoe of my friends is also a
boat to sails; as they that serve themselves of the wind of the
west, and we make a walk to the sail of the most agreeables just
to Coockham. After the “fivocklock” we remount the river,
and in fine we render ourselves to London, very content of a
pique-nique truly charming.
Agree, my dear Mister,
distinguished,
with my considerations the most

GERALD isn't a bad sort of boy in his way, and I daresay I can

But I'm afraid she cares a great deal more about her work than

Elementary Jane, by Richard PRYCE (HUTCHINson), is a story
of the life of the curious crowd my Baronite, driving Westward
from Waterloo Station, sees every Monday grouped outside a
ublic house at the corner of York Road. Women and girls in
É. and frocks of boldest colour; clean-shaven men in gorgeous
waistcoats; stout women seated in the minutest of gigs drawn by
the tiniest of ponies, covered by the most brilliant of horse-
cloths. Rather a vulgar crowd the passer-by may think, a people
apart from his respectable walk in life. , Mr. PRyce knows tº em
intimately; how they live, and where; how they act, drink, and
eat; how they make love and (sometimes) marry. He paints
them on his canvas with a free hand, not too bold, whilst the
innate vulgarity of the surroundings is chastened by the pure,
unselfish, if elementary (why elementary P), JANE. To the art
of the story-teller Mr. PRyce adds an admirable literary style.

SCENE–The garden at “Sunny Bank,” Trimbledon, the residence of
Miss CAMILLA LYDE, author of “Fettered to a Fool,” “In the Sight
of Heaven,” and other popular novels, Miss LYDE (age about thirty-
fire, tall, handsome, with a somewhat high-strung and sensitive ex-
pression) is in a wicker-chair on the lawn, engaged in answering a
reply-telegram which her parlour-maid, KeziA Stilwell, has just
brought out. Her niec, No RA VyviaN, an ex:eedingly pretty girl
of about twenty-four, is seated near.
Miss Lyde (as she writes). I suppose I ought to ask him to
lunch. (Handing reply-form to Kºzia, a pale, sandy-haired girl,
who has been waiting in dignified abstraction.) There, KEZLA,
just see if you can make it out.
Kezia. It's perfectly legible, Miss. (Reading aloud.) “BowAtER,
Lebanon Lodge, Starbiton. Yes. Delighted to see you; but do
come to lunch at two, if possible. LYDE.”
Miss Lyde. Make the telegraph-boy read it, too. And, KEZLA,
get out my bicycle, please, I shall want it directly.
Kezia. If you were thinking of going to Fitcham, Miss, I went
over before breakfast myself, and there was nothing for you.
Miss Lyde. There may be an answer by midday; at all events,
I can go over and see.
Kezia. I could easily go again, Miss, and save you the trouble.
And I could tell the post-office people to forward anything that

Miss Lyde. I thought I told you I didn't wish that done. And
I can't spare you this morning. I shall go to Fitcham myself.

Camilla. No ; but as yet I don't feel that we have enough in

No artist, above all, no literary artist, should marry anyone who
is not in entire sympathy with his or her Art. I am perfectly
certain that I should be a miserable woman if I married a man
who had no genuine appreciation of my work.
Nora. If Mr. BowATER didn't appreciate your work, he
wouldn't be so eager to publish your next novel.
Camilla. It doesn't follow. He might, for all I can tell, be
merely anxious to please me.
Nºra. But wouldn't that show how deeply devoted he was to
you
Camilla. I shouldn't care for a devotion which showed itself
in deceiving me. Besides, I should learn the truth sooner or
later, and then it would be all the worse. No, before I could
ever bring myself to think of JAsoN BowATER as–in that
way, he must convince me that he values my work for its own
sake, that it appeals to his intellect, and satisfies his taste.

you—though you do snub him so unmercifully.
Nora. Oh, that's good for him, he's much too conceited. But
GERALD isn't a bad sort of boy in his way, and I daresay I can
manage to put up with him for one afternoon.

Elementary Jane, by Richard PRycE (HUTCHINson), is a story
of the life of the curious crowd my Baronite, driving Westward
from Waterloo Station, sees every Monday grouped outside a
ublic house at the corner of York Road. Women and girls in
É. and frocks of boldest colour; clean-shaven men in gorgeous
waistcoats; stout women seated in the minutest of gigs drawn by
the tiniest of ponies, covered by the most brilliant of horse-
cloths. Rather a vulgar crowd the passer-by may think, a people
apart from his respectable walk in life. , Mr. PRyce knows tº em
intimately; how they live, and where; how they act, drink, and
eat; how they make love and (sometimes) marry. He paints
them on his canvas with a free hand, not too bold, whilst the
innate vulgarity of the surroundings is chastened by the pure,
unselfish, if elementary (why elementary P), JANE. To the art
of the story-teller Mr. PRycE adds an admirable literary style.

HE was distinctly alone. The streets
were empty, the country depopulated.
There was not a sign of living being on sea
or land beneath the sky. There were re-
cords, though, of the race that had dis-
appeared.
“Yes,” said the man, taking up a few
magazines and glancing at their contents.
“Here are the customary articles. An
illustrated interview—and another, and an-
other! Nothing but illustrated interviews |
I am weary of them l’”
And he threw down the pile of ephe-
meral literature with a gesture of distaste.
But the idea haunted him. It made him
search the more diligently for the missing
man. He was to be his companion, his
friend, his benefactor. But no, the quest
was made in vain. He was gone from the
towns, the trains, the seaside, the conti-
ment.” There was no trace of his presence
anywhere.
“But it must be done,” murmured the
survivor. “Ah! I have an idea!”
And then he procured pens, ink and
paper, and set to work. #. wrote for a
long time, rising now and again to take
pot-shots at his surroundings with his
pocket camera. At length his task was
accomplished.
“I am in the fashion,” he exclaimed,
with pride. “My life is at length revealed.
I have fallen back upon autobiography.”
And the author glanced at his MS. ap-
rovingly. . It bore the title, “The Last

With a force that breaks and shivers
In a pent-up power of smash!
But give me the gentler twining
Of a rivulet obscure,
That 'mid meadows ever shining
Sings the song of water pure!
Some hail the doughty scaling
Of a peak that's long defied
All the mountaineers, who, failing,
Leave their bones to deck its side.

Where there stands a goodly inn,
And the climber's weary marrow
Is refreshed by ale within'

And extol its pomp and pride!

Will make me “fizz up"—I’m off!

HOLIDAY RESORTS.
The following list of charming places wherein to spend the
holidays has been sent us by Messrs. Doroke and DIDDLEUM, the
well-known agents. By some accident, we seem to have received
an annotated copy reserved for the firm's private use, which we
therefore publish with a great deal of pleasure.
... “Shingleford-on-Sea.—This delightful spot is rapidly winning
its way to the first rank of favourite sea-side resorts. Its splendid
pier, its charming Aquarium, its delightful Assembly-rooms will
(N.B.:-They are not built yet) afford visitors a never-failing
round of amusement. Al fresco concerts are given daily (two
hurdy-gurdies, one bagpipes, one concertina with monkey), and
splendid sea-fishing may be had (by those who bring a boat of
their own; there are none for hire). We can recommend to
those who propose to visit this favoured spot the attractive resi-
dence known as 2, Marine Place, which we have received in-
structions to let at a very moderate rental. Conveniently re-
moved from the town (three miles) it commands a delightful view
| of the ocean (from the roof, with a telescope). Its sanitary
| arrangements have been recently put into complete order (the last
| tenant died from typhoid). As Shingleford is certain to be
| crowded by the nobility and gentry during this season—in fact,
every room at the Hotel Red Lion is full at the time of writing—
(quite true; SANGER's circus is spending a night there)—an early
- application should be made.
‘De Courcy Hall.—This magnificent mansion is to be let for
| six weeks. It stands in its own park-like grounds, and is within
easy distance of a station (six miles). It contains noble recep-
tion rooms, furnished in true mediaeval fashion (i.e., trestle
tables, forms, and no carpets), and about forty guests could be
entertained in it with ease. (Might almost say fifty—in term-time

is a private chapel, a cricket ground, and gravel court-yard.
(Query.—Would it not be better to strike out the last sentence?
Mustn't let it be known that after six weeks De Courcy Hall will
again become Swishington College.) -
“To lovers of boating.—We are instructed to let for a short
term the charming bijou residence known as Waterside Cottage.
While comparatively close to London, it offers all the attractions
of Venice (especially when the river comes in at the dining-
room windows). It stands in the midst of delightful scenery;
there is a charming lawn, and the river is at the bottom of the
garden (except when the garden is at the bottom of the river,
which it usually is). Fishing rights are included in the lease,
and as many as one hundred and fifty fish have been taken by a
former tenant in one day (minnows). For permission to view,
application must be made to us. (N.B.-Be careful only to
allow people to view when the place isn't flooded.) We can con-
fidently recommend this as a holiday seat. The tenant will have
the use of a large boat free of charge. (This is kept in the hall
in case the river rises suddenly.)
“Tumbleton Towers.-This historic house, close to the lofty
cliffs of Sandiford, is to be let. It possesses the charm of an
antique castle, together with the conveniences of a modern resi-
dence. To all those who really love a picturesque and mediaeval
home, it should offer special attractions. (N.B.-It was built,
as a matter of fact, ten years ago, by Messrs. JERRYBUILDER, but
it’s a really splendid imitation of a mediaeval ruin.) Very prompt
application should be made by intending tenants. (The place
may come down with a run any day!).”
ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.-Mr. FitzALAN Hope, the defeated of
Sheffield by a diminished majority, looks on the Bright-side of


tories.) To any wishing for a holiday of real country-house life,
the contest. Although unsuccessful, he is not a forlorn Hope.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIWAR1.
“IN THE NAME,0F JUSTICE–WIGSl"
(To the Editor of “Punch.”)
SIR,-To use the customary formula—
one that tradition, combining truth with
justice, has sanctioned—“you, as the re-
presentative of the profession of the law,”
are bound to protect its interests. I have
no wish to complain of the decisions of the
Lord Chief Justice, for they have invari-
ably been of the highest excellence. Still
I am forced, in the cause of the dignity of
the Bench and Bar, to protest against a
ruling in a case which was heard by his
Lordship as recently as the 5th instant.
I can do this with the less hesitation, as
my objection in no way affects the rights
of parties. It will be remembered that the
Thursday to which I call attention was
remarkable for the extreme sultriness of
the temperature. According to the re-
porters the thermometer marked from
eighty to ninety in the shade, and no doubt
such a heat was very trying. Influenced
by these atmospheric considerations, the
Lord Chief Justice, not only invited the
counsel practising before him to remove
their wigs, but set the example of dis-
pensing with his own headgear.
Now, I can make every excuse for such
a proceeding, but surely anything that
deprives the Bench and Bar of a cherished
privilege is to be deprecated? It is com-
mon knowledge that for many years past
there has been a movement to put the two
branches of the profession on an equality.
A great distinction between the barrister
and the solicitor has been the wearing of
the one-time honoured horse-hair. he
gown has been adopted when the junior
branch has pleaded in the minor Courts
but the wig has been sacred. I would
consequently ask, Is it quite judicious to
rmit an innovation which may be fol-
owed up by others even more dangerous?
That I write unselfishly will be believed
by all my friends to whom my name is
known. But as others may be more criti-
cal, will you permit me to add that the
new departure, if allowed to become a regu-
lation, would practically lead to my re-
º as an advocate. In evidence
of this I would explain that, from a regret-
table oversight on the part of my excellent
and admirable clerk, PortingtoN, my own
wig has been mislaid for the last six years.

(Fragment from a Telegroph Romance—more
than less imaginary.)
It was certainly of the greatest import-
ance that the despatch should be conveyed
to its destination, and at once. The mil-
lionaire looked in all directions for a
cab, but none could be found. Then he
sought for a messenger, but again his luck
failed him.
“But it must, it shall go!” he mur-
mured; and then he added, after a
moment's hesitation, “It’s a desperate
course, but I will pursue it. I will wire' "
So he hurried to the telegraph office.
He rushed in and filled in the form. Then
he passed the little paper through the
grille.
“And so we all went down to Herne
Bay and had a shrimp tea,” said a young
lady behind the counter.
“Now, did you, dear?” responded a
colleague. “Well, for my part, I prefer
the Crvstal Palace.”
“Will you kindly send this telegram P”
“Yes; Sydenham is all very well in its

The young lady behind the counter re-
garded the millionaire with astonishment.
“Yes,” said he. “I am addressing you,
and when you have done chatting over
your domestic affairs, perhaps you will
attend to me.”
“Do you want postage stamps?”
“No ; I want this telegram despatched.”
“Well, I can't attend to that,” replied
the maiden, turning again to her col-
league. “Yes; I like Herne Bay; and
now, with these afternoon excursions, it's
so convenient.”
“Can't I send a telegram P” cried the
millionaire.
“No ; you can’t,” returned the young
lady, tartly. “The operators have tem-
norarily resigned. And what an idea!
Only so far ! Why don’t you take it your-

THE SEASON-ENJOYER'S WADE MEGUM.
(To be considered at the Sea-side.)
Question. What is your first step to
secure enjoyment for yourself and sur-
roundings during the London season P
Answer. To take a house or flat in town.
Q. Which of the two residences is pre-
ferable? .
A. The house is more dignified, and the
flat more compact. The first with , its
larger staff of servants is more expensive,
while the last, with its neighbours to the
right, to the left, overhead, and under-
neath, is scarcely as private as may be
desirable.
Q. Settled in town, what should you do?
A. Give a crush to your friends, and
expect crushes in return.
Q. When may a crush be considered
successful?
A. When so many guests arrive that
the last-comers cannot get beyond the
doºrstºº
Q. What are the customary incidents of
an ordinary crush P
A. A crowd on the staircase; a hand-
squeeze at the door; a muffled conversa-
tion to the sound of music in the distance,
and the lightest of light refreshments in
the hottest of dining-rooms.
Q. Can any other pleasure be extracted
from such a function ?
A. Some satisfaction may be obtained
by the appearance of one's name in the
list of invited published in the smart
newspapers.
Q. Are there any distractions other than
those wou have indicated P
A. Plenty. Dinners, visits to the play,
with supper afterwards, and of course any
number of dances.
Q. What is a dinner?
A. From a Society point of view, a
solemn function for the wiping off of old
scores, and the creation of new claims.
s it necessary that a dinner should
be eatable P
A. Not absolutely; but it is better that
at least one course, exclusive of the soup,
should be possible for even a malade
imaginaire.
Q. Should the wine be unimpeachable?
A. It should be of a character that it
could be drunk without fear and spoken
of subsequently without reproach.
Q. You have mentioned visits to the
play—do they lead to gaiety? "
A. If the visitors are fairly cheerful
Q. But surely the action of the stage
prevents conversation — lively or the re-
verse—in the auditorium ?
A. Not at all. In fact, the dialogue on
the stage is rather a help than otherwise to
a chat in the stalls.
Q. Are there any other pleasures which
you have not mentioned connected with
the London Season P
A. Any number. The Park, the Opera,
and a hundred other distractions.
Q. And then bicycling is an out-door
feature with the revellers?
A. Not quite so much as formerly. To
sum up, all May, June, and July are passed
in a continuous whirl of excitement.
Q. Quite so. And what is the greatest
pleasure of the Season 2

alone. KRZIA announces Mr. GERALD ALABAstER. He is a good-
looking youth of about twenty-four, with a pleasant, boyish face, and
a certain air of ingenuous self-sufficiency.

CAMILIA will be in directly. So you've managed to tear yourself
away from the Treasury in time for lunch P
Gerald. Yes. They don't keep our noses quite so close to the
grindstone on Saturdays, you know.
. Nora. I don't believe your profiles are ever in much danger.
You generally get away at four, don't you? And you haven't
any work to do in the evenings.
Gerald. As it happens, I do work in the evenings, occasionally.
Nora. I suppose you roll the lawn or water the flower-beds?
Gerald. No, there's nothing of the old Adam about me. I do
literary work—of sorts.
Nora. GERALD, don't tell me you’ve gone in for writing novels'
Gerald. I’ve gone in for reading them—worse luck!
Nora. And you call that work?' I should call it amusement.
Gerald. Oh, is it, though P. Not when they’re in manuscript.
It's like this, 'Nonº. I've accepted the post .# reader to BowATER
—the publisher, you know.
Nora. Of course I know Mr. BowATER. But I thought he
made a point of reading everything for himself.
Gerald. Till lately. But he gets such quantities of stuff sent
him that he can't wade through it all. And I’ve met him
here once or twice, and at one or two other places, and we
rather chummed; found we agreed on literary subjects, and so
on, and the other day he asked me if I would care to read a manu-
script for him now and then and let him know my opinion of it.
So of course I jumped at the chance. There’s no knowing what
Nora. I never thought of you as a great authority on Litera-
ture, somehow.
Gerald. Oh, I got through a lot of novels at Oxford. And I
didn't do so badly in my schools. I fancy I’ve rather a feeling
for style, and all that. I shouldn't recommend BowATER to
publish anything that didn't strike me as really first-rate.
Nora. And have you come across anything yet that did strike
you as first-rate P
Gerald. Well, up to the present I’ve only had one, and there
couldn’t be two opinions about that.
Nora (to herself). If it should be CAMILLA's 1 (Aloud.) You
mean about its cleverness?
Gerald. No, I mean about its being unmitigated bosh.
Nora (to herself). It isn't CAMILLA's. (Aloud.) So bad as
all that?
Gerald. Utter rubbish.
of the first chapter.
Nora. And so you didn't trouble yourself to read any further?
Gerald. I beg your pardon. There was a weird fascination
about its foolishness that held me. I read every—well, almost
every page of the confounded thing. I could pass an exam. in it.
Kind of stuff one would like to forget, but can’t. When
BowATER reads my report, I don't think he'll feel much hesitation
about returning Stolen Sweets.
Nora. Stolen Sweets! GERALD, it wasn't called that
Gerald. Ridiculous title, isn't it? But better than the book.
I haven't written much about it, but I fancy I’ve said enough
to save BowATER the trouble of reading it himself.
Nora (to herself). It can't be the same ! (Aloud.) Do-do
you remember the author's name P Was it a man?
Gerald. It was certainly written by a woman—but so far as I
remember it was anonymous. At least, there was a letter sent
with it, saying that the author preferred to blush unseen as

suppºse-you discovered this novel had been written by—by
somebody you knew—would not that make a difference in your
opinion?
Gerald. A considerable difference in my opinion of its author.
Nora (desperately). Suppose I was the author?
Gerald. It won't do, NorA. I know you haven't a very high
opinion of my intellect, but I’m not taken in quite so easily as all
that. You never wrote Stolen Sweets—it's simply impossible.
Mora, Well, then, I didn't; but—but a very great friend of
mine did.
Gerald. I can't congratulate her—or you.
Nora. I didn't ask you to. But couldn't you tone down that
report, or—or something?
Gerald. It's too late. I sent it in the day before yesterday.
Bowater ought to have got it by now.
Nora; Well, you could tell him quietly that you had entirely
changed your mind about the ...
Gerald. But I haven't.
Nora. What does that matter? Couldn't you say so—to
please me?
Gerald. There isn't much I wouldn't do to please you, Nora-
but, don't you see, I'm in a position of trust, so to speak. I
can't recommend BowATER to publish a novel that's absolute
drivel, not even to oblige a fºn; of yours. BowATER has a great
reputation for bringing out only the higher sort of fiction. It
wouldn't be fair to him... I must consider his interests, you know.
Nora. He ought to be very much obliged to you. But tell
me this, GERALD, would you say that my Aunt's writing was
“absolute drivel,” to use your elegant expression?
Gerald. Of course not, though I’m bound to say I've never
read a line of her.
Nora. Oh, yes, you have—though you may not be aware of it.
And possibly you’re not aware either that Mr. BowATER is very
anxious to secure a novel by my Aunt, that he is an immense
admirer of hers, and—unless I’m very much mistaken—intends
to ask her to marry him on the very first opportunity?
Gerald. I can't for the life of me understand what that has to
do with it.
Nora. No, you wouldn't. But all I can say is that, if Mr.
BowATER declines Stolen Sweets unread, on your advice, he will
never forgive you. And no more will Il

My Aunt has gone over to the post office at Fitcham to inquire
if there is a letter for M. N. And Mr. BowATER is coming over

of touching her heart if she once knows he has declined her novel?

I Do not mean the Kodak-fiend,

Of amatory couples “tripping.”

Who spreads upon the beach his lures,
What time the season's at its smartest.
His tongue is glib, his terms are cheap,
For ninepence while you wait he'll take you;
Posterity shall, marv'lling, kee
The “tin-type” masterpiece le 'll make you.

A PROGRESSIVE QUESTION.
DEAR MR; PUNCH,-In George Street, Richmond, this week, I
had a singular proof of the superiority nowadays of the Opposi-
tion Sex. There passed along that tortuous thoroughfare, on a
bicycle, a fair-haired damsel attired in a man's cap, a man's shirt,
.a man's pair of knickerbockers plus ** and shoes. The
lady also adopted the jockey style of riding. The public and the
olice looked on admiringly. Now, had I put on a woman's
nnet, a woman's bodice, and a woman's skirt under similar
circumstances, I should have been stopped, arrested, and fined.
The wheel-rights of women are evidently progressing.
Yours obediently, Ixion Rowley.

THERE's not a toper whom you meet at any public bar in town,
Who when he says “liquor up "does not mean “Let’s put liquor

THE only fault my Baronite finds with Pot-Pourri from a
Surrey Garden. (SMITH, ELDER) is the quite unnecessary intro-
duction of the foreign compound word in the title. It is odious
enough in its own country. Dragged into a Surrey garden it
supplies a jarring note to the restful hum as of innumerable bees.
Mrs. EARLE has been led astray in this small matter by anxiety to
be precise. Strolling through her Surrey garden with keen eye
for faded leaves, weeds, . slugs, she pleasantly talks of a
multitude of things. Forced bulbs, rhubarb tarts, sowing
annuals, making coffee, winter-gardening, colour-blindness, pack-
ing cut flowers, the stewing of chickens and game, early rising,
and orange-marmalade are only a few topics of her pleasant chat.
She is content to talk without making effort to write, a method
which, consciously or unconsciously adopted, often leads to good
literature. The Surrey garden is comparatively small in area.
It cannot take us all in to enjoy companionship of its charming
custodian. Happily, here is the book, through which ripples the
low voice of a gracious-mannered gentlewoman, who knows most
things about house and garden, and modestly shares with the
stranger at her gate the garnered fruit of long experience.
The comedy in Good Mrs. Hypocrite (HUTCHINson) is so ex-
cellent that my Baronite thinks RITA would have done well to
have foregone the luxury of the tragedy abruptly introduced in
the penultimate chapter. But the earlier and much longer
part through which the servant-maid Tibbie elbows her way with
angular force is so good that what looks like a wanton fault of
construction may be forgiven. Tibbie is quite delightful—when
studied in another and distant household. In one's own home
she might pall upon the taste.
Punch's advice to Persons About to Marry was, more than a
eneration ago, enshrined in the proverbial philosophy of the
nglish-speaking race. My Baronite's advice to persons in
that parlous condition is to read The Larramys (HUTCHINson):
Most of the characters in Mr. GEORGE Ford's powerful novel
run, or are driven, in couples. Invariably they have a bad time.

(Mr. Punch's Special Correspondence.)
Swanage.—This is a spot remarkable for
possessing but little foliage and an enor-
mous Model of the Earth. To compensate
for the absence of trees, lettuces are
singularly prolific in the Isle of Purbeck,
.# the model in question affords a ready
means of conveying instruction at no ex-
nse to the visiting child. Corfe Castle,
tudland Bay, and “Old Harry” (minus
his defunct wife), are as attractive as the
iobsters for which the pretty Dorsetshire
watering place is so renowned. In some
ople. At Swanage, they all swear by
Urt.
Margate.—As usual, this Koh-i-Noor of
Kent is sparkling with splendour. A
famous high-low comedian, , , renowned
for his pontaneous and *...*.
“wheezes,” remarked yesterday that the
only black thing, bar the “Niggers,” about
the place is the jetty. His quip was
naturally greeted with hurricanes of
laughter and copious doses of restorative
Scottish whiskey. The Aristocrats ot
Cliftonville, as well as the humbler but
possibly more jovial denizens of Margate
proper and improper, have no reason to
complain of that genial doctor (not of
His recipes sniff of the briny. Miss BE-
LINDA PLANTAGENET, the well-known serio-
comique, Madame WRIGGLINI, the famous
centortionist, Baron BUFFARD, the re-
nowned baritone, and Chevalier MAccA-
RoNI, the decorated tenor, are among our
most noted patrons. The Flagstaff is in
superb condition, as also are the “Aunt
Sallies.”
Minehead.—Where can we find a Plume
of Feathers? Only at Minehead, where a
personage not unknown in the precincts
of Whitefriars supplies golf and hunters,
with many other luxuries. We only sug-
gest a rhyme to “whistle” and “thistle”
to suggest a solution of the conundrum.
Whence the name of this favoured spot?
A correspondent writes that an English
monarch (was it HENRY THE Fourth P),
while hanging brigands and other caitiffs
in the vicinity, exclaimed after a hard day's
work, “Mine head doth ache. Don't stir,”
and forthwith bestowed the fiefs, &c., on
the LUTTRELL of the day for his singular
sympathy with the King's malady. Hence
Minehead and Dunster Castle. We only
repeat this legend as a local on dit, as the
French have it. The great charm of Mine-
head is that the stranger never knows
whether he be in Somerset or Devon.
The inhabitants on both sides of the border
drink cider and speak—what shall we call
it?—Lorna Doonish P
I'enzance. — There are no pirates here
now. They were killed by Mr. W. S.
GILBERT and Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN, and
have most of them become churchwardens
and sidesmen. Those who have not been
converted have apparently developed into
hotel and lodging house keepers, and no
longer present pistols, but bills. They are
an amiable race, and are very proud of St.
Michael's Mount and Mount's Bay. Nia-
gara, the Pyramids, the ruins of Baalbec,
and the remains of Nineveh, are not in it
with St. Michael's and the Mounts. They
are unique. Only herrings or mackerel
could be more belauded. A London man
came down last Wednesday fortnight,
and talked about St. Paul's Cathedral.
“Heaven help thee,” cried a staunch
man of the Grand Öld Duchy, “Go to
Truro !” And he was justified, inasmuch
as the cucumber season is now in full
blast.
Ryde.—Now and again you come across
a Person who objects to the long voyage
down the Pier at Ryde. He (but it is
generally She) must be curiously consti-
tuted. On landing from the Portsmouth
boat is there not a “Rest and be thankful”
kiosque right before the traveller's
eyeballs, with copious seagulls flitting
hither and thither as plentiful as grouse
on a well-furnished Scottish moor? What
more enchanting scene could be expected?
He or She may complain of the tolls, but
does not the house of the Royal Victoria
Yacht Club compensate for the disburse-
ment of a few paltry coppers, or rather,
bronzes? Ryde, moreover, has one great
advantage over many watering places. It
is always possible to go anywhere from
Ryde. The entertainment at the Pier
Head may not unjustly be compared to
the harmonious luxury of the Royal
Italian Opera, and at the neighbouring
village of Sea View shoes and stockings
are apparently unknown. Prawns in Ryde
are apparently often confounded with our
glorious and gorgeous pink shrimps.
Ramsgate.—Mr. FRITH, R.A., once im:
mortalized Ramsgate, that is to say if
any immortalization were possible. ou

the cliffs and looked down on the harbour,

mingham. It isn't exactly heaven on a hot

Russell's pen would be needed to tell in

such circumstances. On the east side, the
inhabitants, being proud, call their com-

wondrous bathing accommodation. In-
deed, it is on record that Prince HAVEM-
offsky recently arrived, and on inquiring
whether he could have an Iceberg Bath,
was met with the response, “Certainly,

Bay is a grand crop.
SPORTIVE SONGS.
A Visitor at a Swiss Hotel, madly enamoured
of a foir Widow, and invariably separated
from her at the tahle d'hôte, addresses an
appeal to her on the back of the Menu.
I Do not like the table d'hôte,
With strident noise and rampant crowd,
With clattering plates' discordant note,
That louder gets and yet more loud.
I do not like the napkinned loons
Who thrust strange dishes 'neath one's
nose ;
I hate the rattle of the spoons,
And long for simple fare's repose !
But martv.r-like I must attend
This Walpurgis of flesh and fowl,
That never seems to have an erd,
While iaws are working cheek by jowl,
Amid a Babel buzz of voice
That would confound a Polyglot.
And yet I join this throng from choice,
For you’d be here if I were not!
You like to hear the touring cad
Discant upon his cycling feats,
Or list to tales of Kur and Bad
The curate yonder oft repeats.
With smiles you lend a ready ear
To fable lyred in Yankee twang,
You have a liking, it is clear.
For scandal told in Pall Mall slang!
You are not bored by stale, drear news
Such as that German loves to bring;
The tragic Frenchman's comic muse
In sympathv to you can sing.
Yon’re friendly, too, with all your sex,
The long-time spinsters, new-made wives,
For youth and age vou've nods and becks,
Amid the din of forks and knives!
My appetite is dead and fled
(Oh, Kellner! stay your constant hand),
And I would hie me off to bed
But for that beastly Teuton band!
Here is the reason—miles away—
At least, so it now seems to me—
My chair is placed from day to day
From where I know it ought to bel
You'll guess, of course, my meaning now,
And why I hate the table d'hôte.
You'll know why I must knit my brow,
A starving Selkirk, quite remotel
I ask, in pity ease my pain!
And fill once more my empty plate.

his defunct wife), are as attractive as the
iobsters for which the pretty Dorsetshire

Margate.—As usual, this Koh-i-Noor of
Kent is sparkling with splendour. A
famous high-low comedian,..., renowned
for his pontaneous and side-splitting
“wheezes,” remarked yesterday that the
only black thing, bar the “Niggers,” about
the place is the jetty. His quip was
naturally greeted with hurricanes of
laughter and copious doses of restorative
Scottish whiskey. The Aristocrats ot
Cliftonville, as well as the humbler but
possibly more jovial denizens of Margate
proper and improper, have no reason to
His recipes sniff of the briny. Miss BE-
LINDA PLANTAGENET, the well-known serio-
comique, Madame WRIGGLINI, the famous
centortionist, Baron BUFFARD, the re-
nowned baritone, and Chevalier MACCA-
RoNI, the decorated tenor, are among our
most noted patrons. The Flagstaff is in
superb condition, as also are the “Aunt
Sallies.”
Minehead.—Where can we find a Plume
of Feathers? Only at Minehead, where a
personage, not unknown in the precincts
of Whitefriars supplies golf and hunters,
with many other luxuries. We only sug-
gest a rhyme to “whistle” and “thistle”
to suggest a solution of the conundrum.
Whence the name of this favoured spot?
A correspondent writes that an English
monarch (was it HENRY THE Fourth P),
while hanging brigands and other caitiffs
in the vicinity, exclaimed after a hard day's
work, “Mine head doth ache. Don't stir,”
and forthwith bestowed the fiefs, &c., on
the LUTTRELL of the day for his singular
sympathy with the King's malady. Hence
Minehead and Dunster Castle. We only
repeat this legend as a local on dit, as the
French have it. The great charm of Mine-
head is that the stranger never knows
whether he be in Somerset or Devon.
The inhabitants on both sides of the border
drink cider and speak—what shall we call
it?—Lorna Doonish *
Penzance. — There are no pirates here
now. They were killed by Mr. W. S.
GILBERT and Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN, and
have most of them become churchwardens
and sidesmen. Those who have not been
converted have apparently developed into
hotel and lodging house keepers, and no
longer present pistols, but bills. They are
an amiable race, and are very proud of St.
Michael's Mount and Mount's Bay. Nia-
gara, the Pyramids, the ruins of Baalbec,
and the remains of Nineveh, are not in it
with St. Michael's and the Mounts. They
are unique. Only herrings or mackerel
could be more belauded. A London man
came down last Wednesday fortnight,
and talked about St. Paul's Cathedral.
“Heaven, help thee,” cried a staunch
man of the Grand Öld Duchy, “Go to
Truro !” And he was justified, inasmuch
as the cucumber season is now in full
blast.
Ryde.—Now and again you come across
a Person who objects to the long voyage
down the Pier at Ryde. He (but it is
generally She) must be curiously consti-
tuted. On landing from the Portsmouth
boat is there not a “Rest and be thankful”
kiosque right before the traveller's
eyeballs, with copious seagulls flitting
hither and thither as plentiful as grouse
on a well-furnished Scottish moor? What
more enchanting scene could be expected?
He or She may complain of the tolls, but
does not the house of the Royal Victoria
Yacht Club compensate for the disburse-
ment of a few paltry coppers, or rather,
bronzes? Ryde, moreover, has one great
advantage over many watering places. It
is always possible to go anywhere from
Ryde. The entertainment at the Pier
Head may not unjustly be compared to
the harmonious luxury of the Royal
Italian Opera, and at the neighbouring
village of Sea View shoes and stockings
are apparently unknown. Prawns in Ryde
are apparently often confounded with our
glorious and gorgeous pink shrimps.
Ramsgate.—Mr. FRITH, R.A., once im-
mortalized Ramsgate, that is to say if

watering place is so renowned. In some
towns, they swear by unmentionable

I Do not like the table d'hôte,
With strident noise and rampant crowd,
With clattering plates' discordant note,
That louder gets and yet more loud.
I do not like the napkinned loons
Who thrust strange dishes 'neath one's

I hate the rattle of the spoons,
And long for simple fare's repose !
But martv.r-like I must attend
This Walpurgis of flesh and fowl,
That never seems to have an erd,
While iaws are working cheek by jowl,
Amid a Babel buzz of voice
That would confound a Polyglot.
And yet I ioin this throng from choice,
For you’d be here if I were not
You like to hear the touring cad
Discant upon his cycling feats,
Or list to tales of Kur and Bad
The curate yonder oft repeats.
With smiles you lend a ready ear
To fable lyred in Yankee twang,
You have a liking, it is clear.
For scandal told in Pall Mall slang!
You are not bored by stale, drear news
Such as that German loves to bring;
The tragic Frenchman's comic muse
In sympathy to you can sing.
Yon’re friendly, too, with all your sex,
The long-time spinsters, new-made wives,
For youth and age vou've nods and becks,
Amid the din of forks and knives!
My appetite is dead and fled
(Oh, Kellner! stay your constant hand),
And I would hie me off to bed
But for that beastly Teuton band!
Here is the reason—miles away—
At least, so it now seems to me—
My chair is placed from day to day
rom where I know it ought to bel
You'll guess, of course, my meaning now,
And why i hate the table d'hôte.

dean), and really this lady may be said to have dipped her pen
into milk and honey, so beautifully were the virtues of our Little
Treasure described. You must know, that being childless and
living in a small cottage, my wife and I have no retainers with
the exception of the Gardener-Boots-Knife-and-Window-Cleaner
and the Little Treasure herself. The G.-B.-K.-and-W. man is |

rought to the notice of the local magistrates for breaches of
public-house discipline, and their son and heir has not failed to
keep up the family reputation. On the other hand, the Little
Treasure is of the Teetotal persuasion, and has been educated at
a Board School with that disregard to cost so dear to the ratepayer
up-to-date. She cannot, it is true, speak her own language with
the accuracy of Dr. JoHNson or Lord MACAULAY, but she
lº. a smattering of French, I suppose, inasmuch as I
ave missed certain works in the Gallic tongue from my book-
shelves—works, moreover, not without a suspicion of cayenne
pepper in their construction. But this literary larceny I would
readily forgive did the Little Treasure answer to her description.
The wife of the eminent clergyman (and rural dean) describes
this exceptional handmaid as the Model Girl of the district, in
fact, but for the expense, there can be no doubt but that the
Board School would have been abolished in order to prove that so
rare a flower should have been cultivated in a more select nursery
garden. Nevertheless, I have ventured to draw up the following
Table of Comparison. The Little Treasure is, according to the
spouse of the eminent divine (and rural dean), said to be
1. Thoroughly honest—to be
trusted with thousands of pounds
(of what not stated), and inno-
cent of the value of precious
metal and stones.
1. She is, according to me,
hopelessly addicted to petty lar-
ceny—her requisitions rangin
from strawberry jam to ; .
onions, and from stray pieces
of bronze to small articles of
jewellery.
2. So clean in all her habits 2. So begrimed as to her face
that the Bishop of the diocese
once compared her to the Pool
of Siloam.
3. So devoted to early rising
that any lark matched against
her would infallibly return to
its uncomfortable resting-place,
the “watery nest,” defeated
and disgraced.
4. Will ºf to do anything.
Never so happy as when at
work. Especially busy with
her needle. Never breaks any-
thing. Has a special knack of
polishing silver ware. Always
carries the plate-basket up to
bed with her at night.
and hands, that the G.-B.-K.,
&c., could readily grow mustard
and cress on her skin.
3. Incapable of stirring till
the milkman, baker, and green-
grocer have piled their produce
on our doorstep. Is suspected
of the assassination of our prize
Cochin China rooster.
4. Grumbles at pulling up a
venetian blind. Has spoiled all
our best table-cloths by cutting
bread on them. We used to
have three dinner and two china
tea-services. Some few sorely
wounded members still exist.
Spoons getting very scarce, and
survivors dirtier day by day.
Such, Sir, is a précis of the difference between the opinion of
the wife of the eminent cleric (and rural dean) and my own.
The latter is not, perhaps, wholly favourable to the Little
Treasure. You will probably say, “Why not give her warn-

from an Antediluvian Point of View,” and
posted it to the Quarterly Entertainer.
Monday.-Just got a recent number
of the Author. See that editors are bound
to return MS. Wire to the editor of the
Quarterly Entertainer to know what has
become of my paper on “Feather-Weights
considered, &c.”
Tuesday.—Reply from editor (by post)
that there is no recollection of the receipt
of my MS. at office of Q. E. Too indig-
nant for further action.
Wednesday.—Have consulted a solicitor.
He is distinctly of opinion that I have a
case for untold damages, or at any rate to
secure a verdict covering costs.
Thursday.—Down to the office of the
Quarterly Entertainer to demand my
rights. Altercation with attendant in the
hall, who attempts to prevent my en-
trance. Force my way into the editor's
room, and find its occupant surrounded by
voluntary contributors asking for their
papers—or his blood. Editor declines to
ive either. Ultimately am ejected with
the rest by the assistant-deputy-junior-sub-
editor and auxiliary chucker-out.

Friday.—Return to the office of the
Quarterly Entertainer with my solicitor,
and freely distribute writs. Find other
would-be contributors engaged in the same
occupation.
Saturday.—Last visit to the bureau of
my adopted periodical. Try to see the
editor, to talk matters over quietly, and
then come to a peaceable arrangement.
Find that the editor is away. Ask for his
private address. After some difficulty, it is
iven to me. Owing to the strain caused
y the suggestion that all MS. should be
returned, the editor has gone—for the
sake of his health—to Colney Hatch.

where Norfolk, jackets, and Sandringham
boots are, as they say in Arctic circles, de
riqueur. Nevertheless, Sheringham is like
the seaweed or the bay tree, flourishing.
Some very exciting contests have recently
taken place, on the links, and there has

red that an eminent member of the

whereby bottled Sheringham air can be
forwarded to London and the great manu-
facturing centres. But those with sound
minds in unsound bodies will take un-

and the pony-chaise jockeys in their gay
jackets are racing with Time all day long.
Why is it that these jockeys cannot thrive
anywhere else? They have tried them at
Bridlington, and several neighbouring
resorts, but in a very short time their gay
jackets get faded and their wearers forlorn.
Only at Scarborough can these humming-
birds on horseback be seen to perfection.
The Russian Prince, who came last week
to drink the waters of the Spa, was doubt-
less disappointed when he found that the

as he and his resplendent lady have, not-
withstanding their aqueous disappoint-
ment, continued their sojourn, it may be
safely asserted that the §º. of

tions superior to those of the Baltic or the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
DARBY JONES AT YORK.
HoNouard SIR, -The ancient strong-
hold of the archbishops of the North, the
universal emporium of those porcine deli-
cacies which the ignorant French invari-
ably describe as jambons de Yorck, and
the headquarters of the Truculent Tyke,
the city “pleasantly situated" (as the
guide books have it) on the rivers Foss
and Ouse, is to my mind chiefly remark-
able for the stretch of Turf somewhat
inauspiciously known as Knavesmire. For
scne occult reason the Romans preferred
to style the town Eboracum; and therefore
hisF. the prelate signs himself “Ebor,”
and the race of the August meeting is
termed the Great Ebor Handicap. A not
illiterate friend declares that the appella-
tion was derived from a man called %.
the Keen Knight, whose wife knocked a
nail into the skull of a foreign military
commander the while he was sleeping off
the effects of a most potent draught of
something stronger than water. As I am
no Historian, my learned friend may, like
a certain waggish barrister, have been
pulling my leg. If so, he may go on haul-
ing, for I believe that my shanks are
attached to my body with tolerable secu-
rity against accident and misadventure.
Wafting aside this persiflage (ever since
the Grand Prix, I cannot help drifting
into Gallic verse), I beg you to believe
honoured Sir, that a pleasanter place o
sojourn than York does not exist in HER
MAJESTY's dominions. I look upon the
magnificent cathedral with awe, but I gaze
upon the splendid breakfasts provided at
the hotels with unconcealed delight. In
the South we are supposed to be gour-
mands (Paris again!) º the first water if
we consume, say, a haddock, a rasher of
bacon, and a couple of eggs to our morn-
ing meal. At York, the honest waiter or
dainty parlourmaid stares at you with
astonishment if, in addition to raiding
the warm food, you do not make the
fiercest onslaught on to the succulent cold
viands with which the sideboard is reeking
—I was going to say groaning, but side-
boards in prose only reek. And the York-
shire grouse ! Ah, Sir! he is a bird to be
thought well of in any Ornithological
Happy Family. Mr. ARCHIBALD STUART-
Wortley has frequently shewn him on
Canvas with a marvellous accuracy of
brush and gun combined, but associated
with chipped potatoes let him smoke for
me on a Dish. Mellowed by a bottle of
choice Burgundy, the Yorkshire grouse
flies away from his cousins over the Border.
But this Gastronomic Elegy has nothing
to do with the question of Knavesmire,
where the Aristocracy of the largest county
in England foregather with the unanimity
of Penguins in the uninhabited isles of the
Southern Pacific. As my esteemed friend
Baron voN KINKLESTEIN, Knight of the
Order of the Cygnet of Mesopotamia, once
remarked, “At York you do not know
which to admire most, the ladies with two
legs or the ladies with four.” He was
considered a bit of a Bard in the Father-
land, but, I regret to say, so misused his
talents in orthography that he is now
being ºf; our Queen-Empress

faults, he was decidedly superior to that

A DIALOGUE Story IN SEVEN PARTs,
PART III.
Scene—The Drawing-room. Mr. JAsoN BowATER has just entered.
He is about forty-five, spare, of medium height, but dignified appear-
ance. He wears a trimly-pointed beard and gold eye-glasses; his
manner and speech have a faintly scholastic flavour.
Bowater. How do you do, Miss WyviaN ? Ah, ALABASTER—the
very man I wanted to see 1 I called at your house on my way up
the hill. You will find something I left there for you when you
go back. Mr. ALABAstER, my dear Miss Nora, is good enough
to give me his invaluable assistance with some of the manuscripts
which I can no longer cope with single-handed. Perhaps he has
mentioned it?
Nora. Yes. He-he did mention it.
Aunt is not in yet.
Bowater. I am afraid her bicycle must have gone wrong again.
I met her near the station, and she had been obliged to stop to
have the hind tyre repaired. We had a little talk, but she had to
go over to Fitcham, she told me, and was in rather a hurry. I
mentioned to her that I'd been looking through an anonymous

really believe that I've unearthed a new genius—unless indeed.

their style as they may, there is a touch about our best authors'
work which— Really, ALABASTER, it's a most extraordinary
book, and if you don't share my enthusiasm about it—
Gerald. Well, I—I may have read it carelessly. I’m very glad,
as it happens, that you came to a different conclusion about it.
Bowater. But you can't have read it at all yet! I’ve only just
left it at your house, in a small black bag, which by-the-bye, I'll
call for on my way home.
Gerald. Did you look at my report on Stolen Sweets? If not,
I—I'd just as soon you didn’t, you know.
Bowater. Stolen Sweets—let me see, oh, yes, I read what you
said about that. Very poor stuff, evidently.
Nora (to herself). Oh, dear, and I made sure it was all right!
I can't imagine why my
Bowater. After his report? No, I knew I should merely be
wasting my time. I told one of my people to see that it was
returned at once with the usual formula, and the author has
probably received it by now.

be chivalrous in these matters. If women will write trash,
why !. And I’ve always gone upon the principle, since I’ve
been in business, of never allowing my name to be associated with
any fiction that nad not some claim to be considered Literature.
On that point I’m inflexible. (Sounds are heard outside.) Ah,
our hostess—at last !
Gerald (to himself). Poor old BowATER When he finds out!
But he can't blame me.

dishevelled). I know I’m abominably late—but I’ve been upset.

reached the post-office.

Fºw things in recent literature are more pathetic than the
Preface written º Mrs. OLIPHANT to what proved to be the last
book published (SMITH, ELDER) in her long and busy lifetime.
The Ways of Life comprise two stories #. by the common
incident of failure on the part of hard-working business men,
trouble falling upon them when they are past i. prime of life,
and have no chance of re-establishing themselves. . Mr. Sandford
is a painter who has won his way to the rank of Royal Acade-
mician. One day he finds his pictures cease to sell, and that he
who once commanded the market is beginning to be spoken of
by his friend as “poor SANDFord.” Mr. Robert Dalyell was
something in the City. In his fiftieth year a long course of finan-
cial prosperity was suddenly overclouded by prospect of bank-
ruptcy; In the Preface Mrs. OLIPHANT tells how she came to
write these sombre stories. They were, she says, produced “under
influence of the strange discovery a man makes when he finds him-
self carried away by the retiring waters, no longer coming in
upon the top of the wave, but going out. “The discovery,”
she testifies, “comes in diverse ways: in the unresponsive
silence which greets an orator who was once interrupted by per-
petual cheers; in the publishing of a book which drops and, is
never heard of more; in the matter of unsold pictures; in the
changed accent with which the fickle public pronounce a once-
favoured name.” Mrs. OLIPHANT does not make direct admission
of her own apprehension, but it is clear that at the time of
writing, the shadows were falling fast. “On the Ebb Tide,” she
called her Preface. Now, like Barkis, she has “gone out with the
tide,” leaving on the hither shore this last of an almost countless
tale of books. It is pleasing to note that in the matter of
finished workmanship it shows no sign of the failure she dreaded.

Robinson. “WELL–ER—TRANSPORTED RATHER THAN DELIGHTED, I should HAVE said.”
I Do
A BID FOR FREEDOM.
(Extracted from the Private Correspondence of
Master Thomas Tittlebat, and kept until the
Summer Vacation for Holiday revding.)
MY DEAR UNCLE,--I know that you like
to have a letter from your affectionate
nephew, and so, as usual, I am, writing
#". a line just now, and as I am doing so,
wish to remind you that it is my birth-
day on Monday week. You should send
off your present by parcel-post on Friday
at latest, so that it may reach me by the
proper day. Besides the regular present
a hamper would be very acceptable, as
require nourishment after the hard work
of last term. (Remember, it must be sent
on Friday—not later.) The one you sent me
last term was no $º. I regret to say,
because it was seized by Jones major, who
is a liar. I will tell you about this.
Jon Es major has a father, who is the
mons, and Jones is always talking rot
about politics, and spouting speeches.
Why, you may ask, do I listen to him?
Alas! my dear uncle, I have no choice.
Once I did point out in the politest way
that he was getting a little mixed in his
arguments. is reply was most forcible.
I had to go to the cook, and beg for a
piece of raw beef-steak.
Towards the end of last term the
temper of old BUNNY (our esteemed head
master, better known, to you as the Rev.
RICHARD BUNBURY, M.A.) was simply too
awful. He set impots. all over the place
without the least excuse, and then gave
out after prayers one night that a half-
holiday would be taken away, because
some one had smashed one of his blessed
cucumber-frames with a fives-ball, and he
couldn't find out who it was. As soon as
we got into the dormitory, Jones major
had us all out into the passage, which he
called “convening a general council.”
BUNNY's conduct was a disgrace to civili-
sation, which was quite true. Then he
asked whether we would remain down-
trodden slaves any longer? We didn't say
anything at first, till JonEs knocked to-
gether the heads of two small boys near
him, calling them “spiritless worms,” and
told them to shout “No.” So we all
shouted “No”—not very loud, because of
BUNNY. “Thank you, my gallant com-
rades,” said Jones, “this spontaneous out-
burst of enthusiasm nerves me anew for
the great struggle. We will begin to-
morrow !”
JENKINs, who is nearly as big as Jones,
asked what we should begin.
“We shall strike, you booby ; we shall
combine against the tyrant employerl''
said JonEs, savagely. “And now we must
make preparations. We are sure to be
met by a lock-out, so the first thing is to
form a strike-fund. Every fellow must
hand me over his week's pocket-money.
I will administer the strike-pay myself!”
There was some murmuring at this, and
a good deal of hesitation.
“If any dastardly black-leg,” roared
JoNEs, “is among us—if the heart of any
of you chaps is so depraved as to distrust
the great principle of co-operation—I’ll
jolly well punch his ugly head l’”
So we had to hand over our pocket-
money. But worse was to come for me.
“I saw a hamper in the hall just now,”
Jon Es continued, “addressed to you,
young TITTLEBAT. That shall be used for
the relief of necessitous strikers.”
Such, my dear uncle, was the fate of
your benevolent gift | Not so much as an
acid drop from it reached the mouth of

Then Jon Es went on with his prepara-
tions. . He set SMITHERs to write, “Down
with the Tyrant!” “Who would be free,
himself must strike!” and other things, in
red ink, on pockethandkerchiefs. Then he
dictated a manifesto, which JAckson had
to write down. It told old BUNNY that
our demands were (1) The half-holiday to
be restored; (2) Jam for tea; (3) First
school an hour later. It added that the
great heart of the nation was with us, and
that we would die rather than yield. Then
JoNEs made another speech.
“To-morrow morning,” he said, “we will
refuse to go into school. We will form a
procession, and march about the yard, and
sing. CARson, I appoint you a picket to
see that no one slinks away. Then old
BUNNY will come out, and a nice rage he’ll
be in. TITTLEBAT, you have been of dis-
tinct service to the cause; your hamper is
most acceptable. Therefore you shalſ have
a special honour. You shall be our dele-
gate.”
I didn't catch his meaning at first.
“But I’m not delicate,” I objected. “If
you want me to go to the sick-room—”
“Delegate, you dunderheaded ninny!”
shouted JonEs, seizing my arm, and twist-
ing it in the most unpleasant manner.
“You and SMITHERs shall interview BUNNY
on our behalf, and read him that mani-
festo.”
Under the circumstances, I did not see
my way to decline the honour.
Next day, the programme was duly car-
ried out. Instead of going into school,
we marched round the yard, waving our
banners, and singing as much of the Mar-
seillaise as we could remember. Soon old
BUNNY appeared, in a towering rage, and
wanted to know what this meant.
“SMITHERs and TITTLEBAT,” shouted

JoNEs, from the background, “are our

When casually I mentioned to friends that I was going for a
summer holiday to Bournemouth, my best friends—who do not
care a hang where I go, provided that I do go and do not bother
them—stared in astonishment, and would have attempted to dis-
suade me from carrying out my intention, had not the idea
evidently occurred to them, as a second thought of the happiest
description, that, by selecting Bournemouth for my summer-holi-
day residence, I should be choosing a spot, within measurable
distance of which none of them would be in the least likely to
be found. Only three among my bosom intimates exhibited any
curiosity as to the exact time of my visit. These friends appeared
much relieved on my expressing my intention of avoiding the
Isle of Wight during “the Cowes week,” and I subsequently
ascertained (though they did not mention it at the time) that
they were members of “the Squadron,” and were due on board
their small yachts for that special aquatic festivity.
They all wished me a “good time of it,” and departed, the
majority going north in search of the wily grouse (a fact they
omitted to mention in my hearing), others to Homburg, Aix, and
similar Continental resorts, where the burden of the chorus is
“The Cure! the Cure! the Cure!”
After some considerably varied experience of watering-places
and seaside resorts, both in summer and winter, I have come to
the conclusion that all of them, wherever they may be, are un-
commonly alike in their effect; only in summer your º
residence must be on a height, away from the town, and in full
view of the sea. At Bournemouth in August there is the purple
woods of pine and fir .# in summer a shade deliciously
cool, but not so absolutely cold as that of the pine-forests on
the hiſis above Royat.
At Bournemouth the air at early morn and dewy eve is sweet-
scented, refreshing, and more or less invigorating, according to
the constitution of the visitor. If only you are a moderately
good sailor, there is so great a variety of trips by sea, in first-rate
steamers, as will satisfy the aspirations and be within the pocket-
compass of the most enthusiastic of nautical amateurs. With such
chances by land as Bournemouth can offer, you will have change
in full for your money. Ashore there is amusement for every-
one, plenty of “places to go to”; river-fishing, picturesque wal
and drives, at fairly reasonable prices. . Mr. DAN GoDFREY,
junior, Lieutenant DAN GoDFREY’s musical heir, conducts a
arge orchestra, which is divided between the Pier and the Winter
Garden, and on Saturday evenings uniting its forces, it comes out
uncommonly strong with a popular programme, supplemented by
good comic singing, and other entertainments, . by conju-
rers, or whistlers, or ventriloquists, or, it may be, by all #1.
In the afternoons there is always at these same Winter Gardens,
—which, by the way, is an enticing but deceptive name in Sum-
mer—a more or less classical concert, as an attraction for those
more seriously and dozily-disposed persons, who, having dined
early or heavily lunched (for Bournemouth does produce a
powerful appetite), do not #. their sixpenee for entrance to
these gardens, where, in a huge glass-house, there are chairs and
benches where they can “lazily, lazily, drowsily, drowsily"
enjoy the sweet strains of most superior composers. It is con-
ceivable that there might be a better place for sound than this
same Hothouse, where the orchestral performers appear as it
were planted amidst ferns, and may be individually and collec-
tively considered as an essential portion of the Fern-iture. Per-
haps, instead of “Classical Concerts,” the afternoon performances
as given here might be known as *The Glassical Concerts.” Mr.
DAN GoDFREY will see to this; and that he should be permanent
musical director at Bournemouth is sufficient guarantee for the
opularity of the selections and for the excellence of the per-
ormance. -

out the steward or under-steward, or under-steward's assistant,
give him the number of your party, and secure your seats for

powerful appetite), do not grudge their sixpence for entrance to
these gardens, where, in a huge glass-house, there are chairs and
benches where they can “lazily, lazily, drowsily, drowsily"
enjoy the sweet strains of most superior composers. It is con-
ceivable that there might be a better place for sound than this
same Hothouse, where the orchestral performers ap as it
were planted amidst ferns, and may be individually and collec-
tively considered as an essential portion of the Fern-iture. Per-
haps, instead of “Classical Concerts,” the afternoon performances
as given here might be known as “The Glassical Concerts.” Mr.
DAN GoDFREY will see to this; and that he should be permanent
musical director at Bournemouth is sufficient guarantee for the
opularity of the selections and for the excellence of the per-
ormance.
But the special attraction offered by Bournemouth to its
visitors, during its summer season, is in the shape of a bait, a sea-
bait, not a “ground-bait,” held out by the steamboat companies,
whether antagonistic or co-operative this deponent knoweth not
for “excursions” (without the Shakspearian addition of
“alarums”) to all sorts of places along the English coast, ranging
in summer a shade deliciously
as that of the pine-forests on

heather (but no grouse, except at the poulterer's), and there are
from Brighton to Torquay, and, occasionally, a voyage to the

French coast, visiting Boulogne or Cherbourg. Of these two last
“trips” I have not as yet had experience, but to those who are
only moderately qualified sailors, I can confidently recommend
the others, especially if you have your own party, so as to secure
your own seats together, and your own table for lunch and the
“Five o'clock.”
Qn these steamers everything is of the A-wunnest character,
with one exception; and to rectify this these Southern steamboat
com es might well take a hint from the perfect arrangements
on the Calais-Douvres line. Empress, Monarch, Lord Elgin, and
Brodick Castle, are ruled by sturdy captains, who know when the
dulce moment has arrived for them to desipere in loco, and served
by civil sailors, *::: pursers. There is capital catering at
reasonable rates, and, with the exception of coffee, for .# if
you are accustomed as a hardy mariner “to rough it,” you can
easily substitute tea, the veriest “stow-away” (as regards wittles
and drink) will be thoroughly satisfied.
Mem.—Go on board a good hour before starting. The early
Boarder secures the best place. This is important.
Mem.—After stepping on deck, saluting, and reporting your-
self to the captain with “Come aboard, cap'en!”, scuttle away
below, all hands on the deck-chairs, on which, when you have
placed them in position and taken their numbers, place your
coats, newspaper, and any impedimenta you may be, carrying
with you. is strategic movement having been taken, seek
out the steward or under-steward, or under-steward's assistant,
give him the number of your party, and secure your seats for
a certain hour, say lunch at 12.30, which gives you a good half
hour's start of other hungry voyageurs, who jī not appear on
the scene until one o'clock, when the hot dishes appear, of which
you will not partake, but be satisfied with quite fresh and just-
boiled lobster (reminding you of the º at Swanage), cold
chicken, and tongue or ham, and a good salad, which you will
mix for yourself.
But this is anticipating. If the boat starts at 10.30, you will
be aboard by 9.30, and from your vantage ground you will find
amusement enough during the next hour in observing the genuine
tourist-varieties that have come here from all parts of Great
Britain and Ireland for a holiday, spiced with a sprinkling of
lively French, and “stolidified” by no inconsiderable number of
although a smoker, and it may be a good sailor, will be grateful
to the captain or his first mate for drawing particular attention
to the order that smoking is strictly forbidden on this deck, and
still further grateful to him for seeing it enforced. Of course,
nyone refusing to obey the captain would be at once put in irons,
and Butlet us hope even the sternest martinet will never
have to proceed to extremities.

AUGUST IN ENGLAND.
DEAR MistER,-The english in-head has the air of to be trans-
lated from the french in-head. But no! Ce n'est pas moi, c'est
le mois. And what month of movement, of vacations! Air the
world, from the royal family just to the most poor little child of
the “Eastend’” renders himself, if that can himself, to a station
of railway. The ones, the princes, go to Goodwood and to Cowes;
the others, the poor little childs, conducted by the good clergy-
mans and by the amiable instructresses of the schools, go to pass
the day at the country for there to see, them also, the good
woods and the cows. Ah the poor littles, les pauvres petits!
All the world is in voyage. The first monday the workers
dispense much of money for to make some excursions to the
border of the sea. Partout some trains of pleasure—de plaisir,
oh la, la / And during all the month in all the streets of London
enormously of “fourwheelers” cabs, and of omnibuses, covered of
baggages and of bicyclettes. The trains are full, the stations are
full. The factors, facteurs, are suchly occupied that one is
obliged of to carry his baggages himself. And the hotels are still
more full. Not only in England, but in Scotland, in France, in
Swiss, partout. What of english travellers!
Thus I rest all tranquilly still some days at London. There he
has there enough of place Since the great heat of the first days
of the month the temperature is less elevated. In effect some
days he has made very fine and very agreeable. I walk myself
at my ease, dressed of very light habits and of hat of straw. How
the streets are desert! In the Piccadilly there is not almost
anybody. And yet the park at side is still very beautiful. But
what difference since the feasts of the Jubilee! Mon Dieu !
I amuse myself much to think to the losses of the speculators
so rapacious who made to construct the tribunes for that day
there. They have well merited their sort, leur sort. But I have
magazines, the librarians-editors, the merchants of bicyclettes
and of all sorts of things, have lost also some enormous sums.
What damage, quel dommage! I demand myself for why. Who
then has ...} The Londonians have dispensed enormously of
money, and nobody has gained anything. Excepted perhaps the
Germans, who fabricated much of decorations, of remembrances,
souvenirs, for these english feasts.
It are alldays the Germans who gain. If NApoleon First lived
still, for sure it would be the Germans whom he could call “A
Nation of Shoppers.” You other English you are very amiable
ºnd you love the Germans when even, quand méme, for you let

of their Ministry of War. Bah, c'est trop fort / Your compatriots

admire not much the shoot to the pigeons. It is a sport truly
despisable. But in a such case it would be a sport of the most
admirables, of the most patriotics.
The Emperor WILLIAM would be furious, he would send some
telegrams partout, he would implore the sympathy of his best
friends, Mister KRUGER and the SULTAN–ah, les dignes associés,
GUILLAUME, PAUL, ABDULet Cie. 1–he would demand of new, with
still more of violence, the augmentation of the german marine,
but he would rest of it at that. And the English also. Your
marine so magnificent, she is alldays the best. As says the
english poet, you would “put your fingers to your nose and
stretch your thumb.” Agree, &c., AUGUSTE.
“OUR SQUARE AT THE SEASIDE.”
(Extract from an Interceptra Letter.)
WE are quite º of our doings. You must know we have
a committee, and they manage it all for us. We have all sorts
of burning questions. Some one wanted to bring in dogs without
muzzles, but the committee sternly interposed, and said they
mustn't do anything of the sort. Many of our houses are let out
in apartments to people from Town, and we can't admit them.
The gardener was j “to exclude any dog unmuzzled, or
which may, do mischief or cause annoyance, and to report the
matter to the committee.” Some of us thought that the com-
mittee were rather putting too much responsibility upon the
shoulders of the gardener. How can he tell from the appearance
of a dog if he may do mischief ? Why, any dog may do mischief.
However, the gardener, when he has any doubt, will probably
report the matter to the committee.
We all hope that another direction to the gardener to “ex-
clude dogs" will not keep him unduly from his work—which,
after all, is to see to the seeds, the grass, and gravel-paths. The
picture of the gardener, “excluding a dog,” chivying it
here, there, and everywhere, has made our Bobby go into fits.
But our lad is noted for his sense of the humorous. Then our
committee have very kindly been looking after our keys for us.
They say that “our keys are not to be lent to strangers!” This
is a happy thought. If we had not this rule to guide us we
should #. been parting with our keys to every passer by. We
should have been calling to every stranger, “Here, my good
Sir, you are doubtless en route for Australia. Take my key of
the Square. You can return it when you come back from the
land of the Southern Cross.”
We have not much fault to find with our committee, save that
perhaps they are not sufficiently explicit in their “regulations”
for our guidance. For instance, they say “that persons must
close the gates on entering and leaving the gardens,” and yet
utter not a single word about opening the same. How on earth
are people to get into the garden unless they open the gates?
That is what is bothering us just at present. However, at the
moment it is impossible to consult the gardener. It would be
perfectly cruel to bother him on so trivial a matter when he has
so much to do in the arriving at the true characters of dogs (and
some curs are so deceitful), and reporting the matter to the
committee. I may have something further to say about our
Square when I write to you next.

DURING his RECENT Tour. IN SwitzERLAND, ToMkINs, who is RATHER NERVous HAD
A Most TERRIFYING experti ENCE.
“A TOUCH OF THE BADGER.”
(A Lay of the Last Stage of Labour.)
“A touch of the badger!” Ah, yes, so
the manager told me that day,
Five year agone now, when he saw that
my whiskers were fast growing grey.
His hair was as white as old Winter; but
then he was deputy-boss,
And I, just a grizzled old grinder, to
whom every grey hair meant loss.
Those words were a knell to my hopes,
for I know, yes, heaven help me, I
know
That the sun of a labourer's life chills and
pales with the first patch o' snow.
Yet ain't it the Good Book that says
hoary locks are a glory, a crown 2
Ah! not at the bench or the scaffold! The
face of the boss wears a frown
As a glance from the tail of his eye tots
you up, with a bit of a stoo
First sign of the days when lon
curves the labourer's back
work
ike a
hoop—
And that terrible “touch of the badger,”
the curse of poor children of toil,
Which gives the first hint to the masters
that greedy old Time's on the spoil.
It do spoil a man, do the grizzle, , the
splash o' the whitewash-brush. Aye!
Us toilers are not tittivators, not after
the days, long gone by,
When first we “walk out” with a sweet-
heart. Poor Bess! Time has spared
her that touch
Which whitens the head like a frost, and
which tightens the heart like a clutch.:
And her hair is as berry-brown now as it
was forty long year ago.
But what is the odds if I’m grizzled, and
bent, and a little bit slow,
\nd ticked in the gaffer's discharge list?
“Your services no more required!”
The slip with those words on means—
doom ; the sharp ending of all we
desired,
The stony wide world and—the work-
house! The finish of hope and of
un
"he seal of a youth that is vanished, the
sign of a course that is run.
\nd yet I'm hand-strong and heart-
steady, less prone to the drink and
the skulk
'han many a chap in his thirties. But
that seems a battered old hulk
}ver which the grey ſlag is seen waving.
And if, after thirty-five year
)f the best of my manhood, old gaffers
don’t want me no longer, 'tis clear
New gaffers will not take me on. Though
I tramp, and I tramp, and I tramp,
}n the chance of a job, till the dust
makes me look like a shiftless old
scamp. -
That grimy, grey flag's still a-floating,
and warns off the world from my
track,
\s the ancient sea-farers were warmed by
the gloomy piratical black.
Thrown aside like an old boot as use-
less : " Yes, that is the lot of our
sort,
\nd “that's the last act in the drama,”
the end of life's comfort and sport.
Who whispers about Old Age Pensions?
Well, that's what our betters do get ;
But we are so many, you see; it seems
all talkee-talkee, as yet,
\nd—too late for me, anyhow ! Ah! my
head's in a whirl and a daze.
Thirty-five year—and thrown out! Is it
manhood and pride, or sheer craze
Sets my thoughts all a-hanker round—
Death, like a light-maddened moth
round a flame?
Thirty-five year, and thrown out!—for
that touch of the badger! A shame!
A shame and a wrong! Yes, I swear 'tis
not Christian and fair. Can it be
When the age that brings honour to
statesmen brings dark desperation
to me?
Poor Bess and the bairns! "Tisn't fear,
but far worser, that catches my
breath.
I gaze on the grey that's my bane till
the yet greyer face of old Death
Draws—draws! It gleams out like a hope
from the mist, and the tangle of
thought.
I can face work or death—not the work-
house. God help me! The poor
moth is caught
In the lure of the one light in darkness!
Sit idle and see her starve? Nay!
There's one way out of all! Who'll dare
blame him who's helplessly driven
that way?

of railway. The ones, the princes, go to Goodwood and to Cowes;
the others, the poor little childs, conducted by the good clergy-
mans and by the amiable instructresses of the schools, go to pass
the day at the country for there to see, them also, the good
woods and the cows. Ah the poor littles, les pauvres petits!
All the world is in voyage. The first monday the workers
dispense much of money for to make some excursions to the
border of the sea. Partout some trains of pleasure—de plaisir,
oh la, la / And during all the month in all the streets of London
enormously of “ jº ” cabs, and of omnibuses, covered of
baggages and of bicyclettes. The trains are full, the stations are
full. The factors, facteurs, are suchly occupied that one is
obliged of to carry his baggages himself. And the hotels are still
more full. Not only in England, but in Scotland, in France, in
Swiss, partout. What of english travellers!
Thus I rest all tranquilly still some days at London. There he
has there enough of place' Since the great heat of the first days
of the month the temperature is less elevated. In effect some
days he has made very fine and very agreeable. I walk myself
at my ease, dressed of very light habits and of hat of straw. How
the streets are desert! In the Piccadilly there is not almost
anybody. And yet the park at side is still very beautiful. But
what difference since the feasts of the Jubilee' Mon Dieu !
I amuse myself much to think to the losses of the speculators
so rapacious who made to construct the tribunes for that day
there. They have well merited their sort, leur sort. But I have
magazines, the librarians-editors, the merchants of bicyclettes
and of all sorts of things, have iost also some enormous sums.
What damage, gº dommage! I demand myself for why. Who
then has gained? The Londonians have dispensed enormously of
money, and nobody has gained anything. Excepted perhaps the
Germans, who fabricated much of decorations, of remembrances,
souvenirs, for these english feasts.
It are alldays the Germans who gain. If NAPoleoN First lived
still, for sure it would be the Germans whom he could call “A
Nation of Shoppers.” You other English you are very amiable
ºnd you love the Germans when even, quand méme, for you let
hem to serve themselves of your country for to train the pigeons
of their Ministry of War. Bah, c'est trop fort / Your compatriots
'ove much the tir-aur-pigeons at Monte Carlo. Eh well, why the
*nglish sportmans shoot they not on the german pigeons P Me I
ldmire not much the shoot to the pigeons. It is a sport truly
despisable. But in a such case it would be a sport of the most
admirables, of the most patriotics.
The Emperor WILLIAM would be furious, he would send some
telegrams partout, he would implore the sympathy of his best
friends, Mister KRUGER and the SULTAN—ah, les dignes associés,
GUILLAUME, PAUL, ABDUL et Cie. 1–he would demand of new, with
still more of violence, the augmentation of the german marine,
but he would rest of it at that. And the English also. Your
marine so magnificent, she is alldays the best. As says the
english poet, you would “put your fingers to your nose and
stretch your thumb.” Agree, &c., AUGUSTE.
“OUR SQUARE AT THE SEASIDE.”
(Extract from an Interceptra Letter.)
WE are quite º of our doings. You must know we have
a committee, and they manage it all for us. We have all sorts
of burning questions. Some one wanted to bring in dogs without
muzzles, but the committee sternly interposed, and said they
mustn't do anything of the sort. Many of our houses are let out
in apartments to people from Town, and we can’t admit them.
The gardener was ordered “to exclude any dog unmuzzled, or
which may, do mischief or cause annoyance, and to report the
matter to the committee.” Some of us thought that the com-
mittee were rather putting too much responsibility upon the
shoulders of the gardener. How can he tell from the appearance
of a dog if he may do mischief ? Why, any dog may do mischief.
However, the gardener, when he has any doubt, will probably
report the matter to the committee.
'e all hope that another direction to the gardener to “ex-
clude dogs’ will not keep him unduly from his work—which,
after all, is to see to the seeds, the grass, and gravel-paths. The
picture of the gardener, “excluding a dog,” chivying it
here, there, and everywhere, has made our Bobby go into fits.
But our lad is noted for his sense of the humorous. Then our
committee have very kindly been looking after our keys for us.
They say that “our keys are not to be lent to strangers!” This
is a happy thought. If we had not this rule to guide us we
should #. been parting with our keys to every passer by. We
should have been calling to every stranger, “Here, my good
Sir, you are doubtless en route for Australia. Take my key of
the Square. You can return it when you come back from the
land of the Southern Cross.”
We have not much fault to find with our committee, save that
perhaps they are not sufficiently explicit in their “regulations”
for our guidance. For instance, they say “that persons must
close the gates on entering and leaving the gardens,” and yet
utter not a single word about opening the same. How on earth
are people to get into the garden unless they open the gates?
That is what is bothering us just at present. However, at the
moment it is impossible to consult the gardener. It would be
perfectly cruel to bother him on so trivial a matter when he has
so much to do in the arriving at the true characters of dogs (and
some curs are so deceitful), and reporting the matter to the
committee. I may have something further to say about our
Square when I write to you next.
…
Mem. by a Manager.
To say “boo” to a goose requires some doing.
In theatres 'tis the goose who does the “booing.”

ENGLISH AS SHE
IS WRITTEN.
DURING his RECENT Tour. IN SwitzERLAND, ToMkINs, who is RATHER NERVous HAD
A Most terrir YING ExperieNCE.
“A TOUCH OF THE BADGER.”
(A Lay of the Last Stage of Labour.)
“A touch of the badger!” Ah, yes, so
the manager told me that day,
Five year agone now, when he saw that
my whiskers were fast growing grey.
His hair was as white as old Winter; but
then he was deputy-boss,
And I, just a grizzled old grinder, to
whom every grey hair meant loss.
Those words were a knell to my hopes,
for I know, yes, heaven help me, I
know
That the sun of a labourer's life chills and
pales with the first patch o' snow.
Yet ain't it the Good Book that says
hoary locks are a glory, a crown 2
Ah! not at the bench or the scaffold! The
face of the boss wears a frown
As a glance from the tail of his eye tots
you up, with a bit of a .."ºn
First sign of the days when long...work
curves the labourer's back like a
hoop—
And that terrible “touch of the badger,”
the curse of poor children of toil,
Which gives the first hint to the masters
that greedy old Time's on the spoil.
It do spoil a man, do the grizzle, , the
splash o' the whitewash-brush. Aye!
Us toilers are not tittivators, not after
the days, long gone by,
When first we “walk out” with a sweet-
heart. Poor Bess! Time has spared
her that touch
Which whitens the head like a frost, and
which tightens the heart like a clutch.:
And her hair is as berry-brown now as it
was forty long year ago.
But what is the odds if I’m grizzled, and
bent, and a little bit slow,
\nd ticked in the gaſſer's discharge list?
“Your services no more required '"
The slip with those words on means—
doom ; the sharp ending of all we
desired,
he stony wide world and—the work-
house! The finish of hope and of
fun
"he seal of a youth that is vanished, the
sign of a course that is run.
\nd yet I’m hand-strong and heart-
steady, less prone to the drink and
the skulk
'han many a chap in his thirties. But
that seems a battered old hulk
}ver which the grey ſlag is seen waving.
And if, after thirty-five year
)f the best of my manhood, old gaffers
don't want me no longer, 'tis clear
New gaffers will not take me on. Though
I tramp, and I tramp, and I tramp,
ju the chance of a job, till the dust
makes me look like a shiftless old
scamp. -
That grimy, grey flag's still a-floating,
and warns off the world from my
track,
As the ancient sea-farers were warmed by
the gloomy piratical black.
Thrown aside like an old boot as use-
less!” Yes, that is the lot of our
sort,
\nd “that's the last act in the drama,”
the end of life's comfort and sport.
Who whispers about Old Age Pensions?
Well, that's what our betters do get ;
But we are so many, you see; it seems
all talkee-talkee, as yet,
And—too late for me, anyhow ! Ah! my
head's in a whirl and a daze.
Thirty-five year—and thrown out! Is it
manhood and pride, or sheer craze
Sets my thoughts all a-hanker round—
Death, like a light-maddened moth
round a flame?
Thirty-five year, and thrown out !-for
that touch of the badger! A shame!
A shame and a wrong! Yes, I swear 'tis
not Christian and fair. Can it be
When the age that brings honour to
statesmen brings dark desperation
to me?
Poor Bess and the bairns! "Tisn't fear,
but far worser, that catches my
breath.
I gaze on the grey that's my bane till
the yet greyer face of old Death
Draws—draws! It gleams out like a hope
from the mist, and the tangle of
thought.
I can face work or death—not the work-
house. God help me! The poor
moth is caught
In the lure of the one light in darkness!
Sit idle and see her starve? Nay!
There's one way out of all! Who'll dare
blame him who's helplessly driven
that way?
With Apologies to MR. ConAN Doyle.
—The G-RM-N EMP-R-R's latest romance is
said to be a startling Nihilist romance
entitled The Sign of Faure. Orders from
Siberia are rushing to Berlin. . The
Retreat from Moscow is treated with con-
siderable humour, and the Fall of Sevas-
topol is described as an interesting episode
leading up to the liberation of the Sultan
of Turkey from the pressure of the Powers
and the installation of Count Tolston, as
First President of the Muscovite, Re-
public. . But we have no Imperial authori-
sation for making this statement, either
from the Neva or the Spree.

OUR”BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE stamp “Second Edition” on a book causes the heart of the
author, to rejoice. Dr. AUBREY will with mixed feelings observe
it on the title-page of his Rise and Growth of the English Nation
(ELIIot Stock). Fire, untroubled by the controversy round th?
question of 3d. discount in the shilling, or merely 26., gobbled up
the whole of the first edition before it could reach the shelves
and counters of rival tradesmen. Presumably the type was
standing, or a chance copy of the book was preserved. Even
Newton would have shrunk from resuming the “many years' re-
search and labour” to which Dr. AUBREY modestly alludes as
having produced these three volumes. His design is, as it was
that of the late J. R. GREEN, to present not pictures more or
less fanciful of kings, great statesmen, and renowned soldiers, but
to tell us how the people worked and lived, slowly, for centuries
unconsciously building up a great empire. In this task he
has fully succeeded. Not that he leaves in misty shape
kings and queens and other men and women whose names are
most familiar in English history. He has the gift, essential to
success in such endeavour, not only of lucidly summarising a long
course of events, but of sketching forceful characters within the
limits of a page. My Baronite, in the course of a reading he
found more fascinating than many novels, is struck with the truth
of the axiom about there being nothing new under the sun. To
cite only three incidents of a multitude that crowd on the
memory: the Salvation Army of to-day have their prototype in
the Mendicant Friars, Dominicans and Franciscans, who took
England by storm at the beginning of the Thirteenth Century.
The Irish Land Leaguers with their policy of boycotting were
forestalled by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who in 1223 ordered
that no persons should buy from or sell to the Jews, or even have
speech with them. Thirdly, but not less striking, the imposition of
death duties by the Plantagenet kings largely contributed to the
revolt which wrested Magna Charta from the unwilling hands of
King John. In these days we have seen how the latest scion of
the House of Plantagenet, temporarily in power as Chancellor of
the Exchequer, claps on death duties on a scale calculated to
bring dukes to destitution.
“474 and just out !” That is not a cricket score. It is merely
the number of pages of The Jubilee, Book, of Cricket, mainly
volume worthy of the fame of the house of BLAckwood. Every-
one who has seen “RANJI’’ in the field, whether bowling or bat-
ting, has borne in upon him the truth that he knows all about
cricket. That he should be able to write about it in a lucid, in-
structive, and attractive manner is quite another thing. The
Prince is, my Baronite tells me, nearly as completely master of
the quill as he is of the willow. The book is admirably conceived,
with intention to instruct the player in all that pertains to the
science of cricket. When a cricketer, young or old, knows all
here set down for his guidance, he will have nothing in the world
to do but carry out the instructions. The work, the most com-
pendious on the subject ever published, has its value increased by
a number of photographs, wonderfully reproduced, showing
famous cricketers in the attitude of play. These also will be most
useful to the novice. In his spare moments he can pose in imita-
tion of the living pictures of the Prince hooking a short-pitched
ball on the wicket; of MoRDAUNT ready for a catch, and looking
uncommonly as if he would get it; of S. M. J. Woods in the act
of delivery, originally studied from Ajax defying the lightning ;
or of WALTER HUMPHREY lob-bowling, looking as if butter would
not melt in his mouth, much less as if the ball he gingerly holds
between fingers and thumb would be so mean as to sneak in and
take a wicket. -
My Baronite confesses that the name of the author of Ripple
and Flood (HUTCHINson) is new to him. Yet it is unlikely that a
novel so cleverly constructed, so living in its characterisation, so
charming in its description of rural, surroundings, can be the
work of a beginner. Taken all round, it is certainly among the
best novels of the year. It is true that behind it there is a dim
echo of Great Expectations, one of the best, and perhaps the least
popularly known of DICKENs's works. In both, the story opens
with the apparition in a small boy's home-life of a mysterious
stranger. There is an uncle as hard-handed as was Pip's aunt,
and there is a girl to be loved, a strange-mannered wench in
quite different ways than was Estella. These may be fanciful
identifications on the part of the reader, or acts of unconscious
cerebration on the part of the writer. However it be, they in no
wise detract from the charm and interest of a powerful story,
through which ripple the waters of the Trent, and murmurs the
country life lived beside its banks.
By way of showing their scope and range, Messrs. HUTCHINson,

“IN THE NAME OF HONOUR-PLAY!”
(Fragment from an Athletic Romance of the Period.)
PEERLess CRichton was the most popular, as he, was indeed
the most accomplished personage in his part of the country.
Morning, noon, and id: he was bombarded with applications
for help. He could write, paint, and compose. There was
nothing he could not accomplish. It was early morning when,
on entering his breakfast-room, he found visitors already as-
sembled.
. “My dear fellow,” said a man with a careworn face, “our last
piece was a frost. Can you knock us up another by Tuesday?”
“Consider it done,” said CRichton, cheerfully. “I always am
pleased to oblige a friend.”
“And I, Sir, wish to appeal to your goodness of heart—my son
is ill. He had promised to finish a portrait that an Australian
millionaire is taking back with him to the land of the Southern
Cross. He is unable to finish it. Will you accept his task?”
“With very great pleasure,” replied CRichton. “If one
painter cannot help another at a pinch what would the world
come to?”
“And you, my dear fellow, must run up the villa for the
earnest desire that their nest should be ready by their return.
My daughter will be so disappointed if I do not keep the promise
made to her mother before she went away.”
CRichton silently pressed his visitor's hand in token of assent.
Then there was a chorus of friends who wished him to join
various boards of management—according to them, with such
advantages his fortune was assured.
“I have already too much to do,” he returned, with a smile.
“After I have written the play, painted the portrait, and built
the villa I will consider my own affairs.”
At this moment there was a hurried ring, followed quickly by
the appearance of a post-office messenger.
“Telegram, Sir.”
CRichton opened the envelope, and after reading its contents,
uttered an exclamation: –
“I must leave you at once,” he cried, rushing away to pack up.
“But how about our theatre, our Colonial patron, our son-in-
law?” cried the chorus.
“They must wait.

“But why do you hurry away ?” - -
“Because, my dear friend, I have just received a wire saying
that I have been chosen to play for my county at cricket. Am I
not right to sacrifice everything to accept the responsibility?”

compelled to answer the question in the affirmative.

. “My dear fellow,” said a man with a careworn face, “our last
piece was a frost. Can you knock us up another by Tuesday?”
“Consider it done,” said CRICHToN, cheerfully. “I always am
pleased to oblige a friend.”
. “And I, Sir, wish to appeal to your goodness of heart—my son
is ill. He had promised to finish a portrait that an Australian
millionaire is taking back with him to the land of the Southern
Cross....He is unable to finish it, Will you accept his task?”
“With very great pleasure,” replied CRichton, “If one
painter cannot help another at a pinch what would the world
come to ?”
“And you, my dear fellow, must run up the villa for the
earnest desire that their nest should be ready by their return.
My daughter will be so disappointed if I do not keep the promise
made to her mother before she went away.”
CRICHToN silently pressed his visitor's hand in token of assent.
Then there was a chorus of friends who wished him to join
various boards of management—according to them, with such
advantages his fortune was assured.
“I have already too much to do,” he returned, with a smile.
“After I have written the play, painted the portrait, and built
the villa I will consider my own affairs.”
At this moment there was a hurried ring, followed quickly by
the appearance of a post-office messenger.
… †. Sir.”
CRichton opened the envelope, and after reading its contents,
uttered an exclamation: –
“I must leave you at once,” he cried, rushing away to pack up.
“But how about our theatre, our Colonial patron, our son-in-
law?” cried the chorus.
“They must wait.
wait!”
“But why do you hurry away ?”
“Because, my dear friend, I have just received a wire saying
that I have been chosen to play for my county at cricket. Am I
not right to sacrifice everything to accept the responsibility?”
And his friends, in spite of their personal inclinations, were
compelled to answer the question in the affirmative.

worked man as you cannot afford to do without substantial
nourishment? Why, putting aside the ordinary business routine
—of which, I know nothing—the mental and physical strain of
reading and forming a decision upon all the innumerable manu-

holiday very soon, now—to the Engadine. Where did you think
of going this summer?

Bowater (to himself). I'll get her to discuss type-writers—they're
harmless enough (Aloud.) Well, you know, I never can rid
myself of a certain prejudice against the type-writer, except for
purely business purposes. Somehow it seems to me to produce a
mechanical—I might almost say an unliterary—effect upon even
the best style. Mere fancy, no doubt. I wonder, now, if you
have any feeling of that sort.
strange you should feel so strongly as that. Do tell me, was this
anonymous novel you were so carried away by written in the
ordinary way, or was that type-written ? It would be interesting
to know.

he fails to notice). ALABAstER must know which it was. Why

success. Of that I am quite certain. And the writer may
rest assured that I shall do everything in my power to en-

DEAR MisTER,-For to avoid the great heat and for to respire
the air of the sea, I have quitted London there is three weeks,
and I am gone to Eastbourn. If I have respired the air of the
sea! Mor Dieu ! Since all that time he has made a time of the
most stormys; without cease some wind, some rain, some tem-
sts. Impossible of to make excursions in sea, one would not

tranquilly on the plage at the middle of a hurricane; impossible
even of to stroll on the promenadel Two times I have essayed of
to carry a new hat of straw. Each time he is parted all to the

brellas are absolutely unuseful. Alldays he must to walk himself
in mackintosch and in casket of voyage. Even one desires to
carry a “south-western" hat, as the marines.
By a such time, what to do? one speaks to me in the hotel
of excursions in train to Hastings and to Brighton. But is it
that he makes fine there down? At Brighton—ah no, by ex-
ample ! I recall to myself the tempests at Brighton there is nine
months. And however. One speaks to me of the games, that
which you call a “match of cricket" or a “cricket-game,” which
have place at Brighton. He appears that these games are the most
remarkable in the department of the Sussexshire, and that one
there sees to play the famous Indian, who calls himself—sapristi,
quel nom 1 ow to write him P. Try we. RANHJTJshihitºſhTIHJ,
or something as that. Eh well, I have never seen a great cricket-
game. Impossible of to find a hurricane more violent at Brighton,
evidently one can to refuge himself in a tribune, at the least it
is something to do. I go there.
Thus I part the thirty and one of the past month, provided of
a mackintosch and carrying on the head an impermeable casket.
After some time. I arrive to Brighton. Tiens! He makes fine.
I mount in “fly,” I say to the coacher, “Go to the cricket-game,”
we file enough quick, and we arrive. As soon as entered I en-
counter a little boy who sells some programmes. I buy of them
one for better to comprehend the game, and then, seeing a
tribune at the shelter of the wind, I pay one shilling and I sit
myself therein.
. Before me extends herself a verdant prairie. All around there
is some tribunes, some benches, and a great assistance. That has
almºst, the air of an arena, and I think to the plaza de toros at
Madrid, where I have seen one time the courses of bulls.
The national sports, english and spanish. But what differenceſ

stained sand! Ah no!. A simple prairie of beautiful “gazon
anglais,” and at the middle some peaceful men, dressed of white,
who amuse themselves to pursue a little ball. A ball, not a buli.
C'est charmant!
Naturally I have often heard to speak of the cricket, but I
have never studied the game. In effect I know not of him even
the origin. But seen that the hindoo princes play him, I suppose
that he comes from the Oriental Indias. I am sure of it ". I
perceive among the §. at Brighton two men in long white
robes. They have absolutely the air of to be Hindoos, a little
pale, at cause of the bad english climate, excepted that each one
carries on the head a melon hat—chapeau melon—at place of a
turban. Evidently also at cause of the bad climate, for to pro-
tect themselves from the rain. See there then the famous Prince
and one of his compatriots. I believed him all young, but I am
deceived myself. Naturally I desire to comprehend that which
they do. Tiens, le programme! I regard him. I read “Sussex
County Cricket Ground. Sussex v. Surrey.” That, that is easy
to understand. But that which follows—thousand thunders! It
is a veritable cryptogram in cipher language, as the little an-
nounces in the french journals. “b. l-b. w. n-b. Total.”
Qu'est-ce que ca veut dire? Et encore, “lbw b Jephson” and "st

But yes! The Hindoos, for sure! BLBwNBToTAL, Lbwbjephson,
STBUTTBHARTLEy. It are the others, the compatriots of

Then I commence to study the game. What is that which they
do? I perceive that the two Hindoos rest planted there, while
that one of the players in european costume throws a ball, which
another hits of a species of little oar, or of long trowel in wood.

himself. But the player with the little oar succeeds never.
Each time that the ball goes herself away, that one there runs
violently towards one of the Hindoos, brandishing his oar, but
another player encounters him, and he retires himself. In same
time other players run very quick, they entrap the ball, and they
throw her against a Hindoo. . But he holds himself there, im-
movable, tranquil, calm, the imperturbable Oriental. Then all
the players change of position, and they attack the other Hindoo.
But they hit him never. Then I comprehend that they do this
express, expres. They wish not to hit him. It is the english
generosity towards a conquered nation. C'est admirable!
Still one thing which I have remarked. The player who carries
the oar puts himself before three little sticks, upright on the
turf."one or two times he who throws the bail is suchly mala-
droit that he makes to fall two of the sticks. All the world
cries, and the oarsman is suchly angry that he plays not more,
but retires himself. It is droll that the players have not some-
thing of more solid for to mark the position of the oarsman. But
these sticks are evidently of oriental origin, for it is one of the

Bowater (to himself, savagely). What the deuce am I to say to
this detestable girl? It’s a deliberate plot—that’s what it is, and
ALABASTER or—or somebody shall answer to me for it!
Kezia (to the company generally). I'm very sorry if I’ve taken da
a liberty, but my feelings got the better of me for the moment.
To hear my own book so highly complimented—it was really too
much for me !
Camilla (with a somewhat laboured graciousness). I am sure Mr.
Bowater will excuse your excitement, KEziA. Genius is such a
rare and precious gift, and his recognition of yours was so
thorough, and so obviously without the slightest suspicion of
being intended for your ears—(BowATER suppresses a groan)—
that it was only natural you should be overcome.
Kezia. I always felt I had it in me to be a genius, as I’ve told
Cook many a time, though, being herself illiterate, she treated me
snatches in the pantry or my own room, on the washstand, where
her blighting influence couldn't reach. As to the title, Miss
LYDE, you may think I borrowed it from that story of your
friend's but it would be erroneous. "i thought of it quite
independently, and why should I change it just because there
happened to be another P
Bowater. A story by a friend of Miss LYDE's P What story
was that?
Kezia. Well, Sir, this is how it was. Miss LYDE came to me
one day
Camilla (hastily). All that is of no interest to Mr. BowATER,
KEZIA. It is your Stolen Sweets that he has expressed such warm
admiration for.
Bowater (feebly). Yes; but perhaps— It just occurs to
i. There may be some—some unfortunate confusion between
the two.
Camilla. Hardly, as it is clearly KEZLA's that contains the
scenes between the Wiscount and the Countess of Chislehurst,
which you quoted as particularly striking. But I should like to
ask her privately about the other manuscript, if you will excuse
me, Mr. BowATER. Will you come into my study, KEZLA, and
tell me exactly what was done with it?
[She leads the way; KEZLA follows unwillingly.
Bowater (with suppressed rage). Well, ALABASTER, you have
made me the victim of a very successful practical joke. I sha’n’t
forget it.
I told you
Gerald. If there's any practical joke, it isn't mine.
from the first that Stolen Sweets was rot—but of course you didn't
think my opinion worth anything! You insisted on my following
your lead and cracking it up at lunch, and I did. And this is
all the thanks I get for it !
Bowater. You distinctly told me that Stolen Sweets was written
by Miss LYDE.
Gerald. I—I was given to understand so.
Bowater. Your own common sense should have told you Miss
LYDE couldn't have written such stuff.
Gerald. I’d never read anything of hers. How was I to tell it
wasn't her usual style? I was taken in myself.
Bowater. Then am I to understand that Miss WYv1AN has been
amusing herself at our expense?
Nora. As if I should play such a trick as that My Aunt told
me in confidence that she had sent you a story anonymously, but
when I heard from GERALD that he had advised you to decline a
novel of the very same title, and with the same initials and
address and everything, why, I couldn't help saying *.
and then he got it all out of me. If he hadn't talked, it wouldn't
have happened -
Bowater. Yes, Sir, you had no business to mention particulars
which you had learnt in a confidential capacity when reading
for me. It was a gross breach of trust.
Gerald (angrily). There was nothing secret about them! At
least, you never told me so. But that’s enough for me. I’m
not going to stay here to be told I’ve been betraying your trust
—after doing everything I could to pull you through a mess that
was mostly your own making !
[He stalks out of the room, and leaves the house.
Nora. Dear Mr. BowATER, don't look like that. I'll do any-
thing I can.
Bowater. Don't you think, Miss WyviaN, that you’ve done
rather too much as it is?
Nora. But I’d better go over to Fitcham and get KEZLA's
novel for you, hadn't I? It would be quite as awkward if she
found out you had declined it—now. And after all, it will be
all right so long as you publish it.
Bowater. “All right !” I must publish it, I know that—I
can't get out of it. But have you any idea what it will mean to
me? I shall stultify all my past career, undo at a blow the repu-
tation I have built up as a publisher of some taste and discrimina-
on. Worse still, when your Aunt comes to know what wretched
twaddle I have been praising to her as a work of true genius—
Great Heavens, genius ! hat will she think of me? how can
she ever respect me again? And I was in hopes that—some-
y— There, that’s over, but unless you want to drive me
quite mad, don't tell me again that it will be “all right”!

Camilla (to KeziA). But tell me what put it into your head to
send your book to Mr. BowATERP
Kezia. Why, to tell you the truth, Miss LYDE, it was your
dictating that letter. Before that, I didn't know who to send

with low derision. And I had to write Stolen Sweets in fits and

thing. And the letter mentioning Stolen Sweets, which happened
to be my very own title, it struck me—why shouldn't I send my
Stolen Sweets. And almost before I'd time to think, I'd done it.
Camilla...I see. But what about the other Stolen Sweets f
... Kezia. Well, I thought it would create confusion, having two
titles alike, so—I knew your friend wouldn't mind—I-I took the
liberty of going over her manuscript, and scratching out the
title wherever it was put.
Camilla. So you sent it without any title at all?
Kezia. I fully intended to, Miss LYDE, and did it up and ad-
dressed it and everything, and then, somehow, I couldn't make
up my mind to send it and put it away in a drawer in the kitchen
dresser. And when I looked for it the other day, it wasn't
there, and the Cook, whose Philistinish ways are a severe trial to
live with, told me as calm as you please that she'd taken it for
some of my scribbling, and put it on the fire. I was annoyed
with her.
Camilla. And why didn't you come and tell me at once P
Rezia. Well, you see, Cook begged me not to—and I’m not the
person to tell tales of a fellow-servant, however inferior.
Camilla. Particularly when your own conduct—, KEZIA,
I'm afraid you have behaved rather deceitfully. I begin to see
why you were so obliging about going over to Fitcham, and why
you did your best to prevent my going there this morning.
Kezia. Indeed, Miss LYDE, I never touched your bicycle. The
valves will get unscrewed at times. And you’ll excuse me, but
your tone is not quite the thing from one literary lady to another
You seem to forget that I am no longer a mere drudge, but your
equal—I might say, your superior, for, with the highest respect
for your talents, Miss, which are very well in their way, nobody
has ever referred to you that I know of as a 'Eavenborn
Genius. And, after what those gentlemen said, you’ll hardly
deny that I’m cne!
Camilla (good-humouredly). No, indeed, KEZLA, and believe
me, I congratulate you most cordially on your success. I could
certainly have wished But there, I mustn't scold such a
distinguished author, and after all, you have done no harm,
though you might have. Now you can go. ... Of course I cannot
expect you to continue your duties, but if you would kindly
mention to BEssie that we will have our coffee in the garden—
Kezia. Oh, Miss LYDE, I shall be very willing to bring out
coffee—as a friend, and perhaps you will allow me a few minutes'
interview later on with my publisher. I’m told that geniuses
can command their own prices nowadays, and he'll find out I’m
quite able to take care of myself.
She goes; a little later NorA bursts in.
Nora. CAMILLA, you’ll hate me, I know, but I must tell you.
Poor Mr. BowATER is nearly out of his mind, and I feel I ought
to do something. (She makes a full confession.) Now do you
understand?

The best thing you can do now is to go to Fitcham and see if
you can recover that manuscript without making any more

tributed to the decision of the Commission on National Defence.
So, with all possible respect, Isalute you once again as my friends

At this there was a feeble cheer. . For a moment the Force
looked lively, but resumed their air of despondency as their chief
continued.
“To reach this level you have had to work hard. Nay, more,
you have had to subscribe liberally from your pecuniary re-
sources. For soldiering, either regular or amateur, costs con-
siderably more than nothung. I think I may say that the price of
the Volunteer Movement, from its inception to the present day,
must be given in tens of millions.”
At this declaration (which was uttered in a tone of proud satis-
faction) there was distinct cheering. The armed host felt that
they had received a compliment.
“And having said this, I have little more to utter. You are
aware that we are on the point of being invaded. You also know
(on excellent authority), that if 50,000, or, at most, 150,000 men

empire's financial burden there would have been a considerable
reduction in the National Debt.”
“And yet, if I am not mistaken, you hinted that we were
quite useless.”
“Certainly—absolutely valueless.”
“Then what shall we do?” And as this question was put the
gallant warriors again became silent.

of consideration, *f really think you had better disband as a

all the thanks I get for it!
Bowater. You distinctly told me that Stolen Sweets was written
by Miss LYDE.
Gerald. I—I was given to understand so.
Bowater. Your own common sense should have told you Miss
LYDE couldn't have written such stuff.
Gerald. I’d never read anything of hers. How was I to tell it
wasn’t her usual style? I was taken in myself.
Bowater. Then am I to understand that Miss WYv1AN has been
amusing herself at our expense?
Nora. As if I should play such a trick as that I My Aunt told
me in confidence that she had sent you a story anonymously, but
when I heard from GERALD that he had advised you to decline a
novel of the very same title, and with the same initials and
address and everything, why, I couldn't help saying something—
and then he got it all out of me. If he hadn't talked, it wouldn't
have happened!
Bowater. Yes, Sir, you had no business to mention particulars
which you had learnt in a confidential capacity when reading
for me. It was a gross breach of trust.
Gerald (angrily). There was nothing secret about them! At
least, you never told me so. But that's enough for me. I’m
not going to stay here to be told I’ve been betraying your trust
—after doing everything I could to pull you through a mess that
was mostly your own making!
[He stalks out of the room, and leaves the house.
Nora. Dear Mr. BowATER, don't look like that. I'll do any-
thing I can.
Bowater. Don't you think, Miss WYv1AN, that you’ve done
rather too much as it is?
Nora. But I’d better go over to Fitcham and get KEZLA's
novel for you, hadn't I? It would be quite as awkward if she
found out you had declined it—now. And after all, it will be
all right so long as you publish it.
Bowater. “All right !” I must publish it, I know that—I
can't get out of it. But have you any idea what it will mean to
me? I shall stultify all my past career, undo at a blow the repu-
tation I have built up as a publisher of some taste and discrimina-
on. Worse still, when your Aunt comes to know what wretched
twaddle I have been º to her as a work of true genius—
Great Heavens, genius ! hat will she think of me? how can
she ever respect me again? And I was in hopes that—some-
day— There, that’s over, but unless you want to drive me
quite mad, don't tell me again that it will be “all right”!

thing. And the letter mentioning Stolen Sweets, which happened
to be my very own title, it struck me—why shouldn't I send my
Stolen Sweets. And almost before I'd time to think, I'd done it.
Camilla...I see. But what about the other Stolen Sweets?
...Kezia. Well, I thought it would create confusion, having two
titles alike, so—I knew your friend wouldn't mind—I-I took the
liberty of going over her manuscript, and scratching out the
title wherever it was put.
Camilla. So you sent it without any title at all?
Rezia. I fully intended to, Miss Lyde, and did it up and ad.
dressed it and everything, and then, somehow, I couldn't make
up my mind to send it, and put it away in a drawer in the kitchen
dresser. And when i looked for it the other day, it wasn't
there, and the Cook, whose Philistinish ways are a severe trial to
live with, told me as calm as you please that she'd taken it for
some of my scribbling, and put it on the fire. I was annoyed
with her.
Camilla. And why didn't you come and tell me at once P
Kezia. Well, you see, Cook begged me not to—and I’m not the
person to tell tales of a fellow-servant, however inferior.
Camilla. Particularly when your own conduct— KEZIA,
I'm afraid you have behaved rather deceitfully. I begin to see
why you were so obliging about going over to Fitcham, and why
you did your best to prevent my going there this morning.
Kezia. Indeed, Miss LYDE, I never touched your bicycle. The
valves will get unscrewed at times. And you’ll excuse me, but
your tone is not quite the thing from one literary lady to another
You seem to forget that I am no longer a mere drudge, but your
equal—I might say, your superior, for, with the highest respect
for your talents, Miss, which are very well in their way, nobody
has ever referred to you that I know of as a 'Eavenborn
Genius. And, after what those gentlemen said, you’ll hardly
deny that I’m cne!
Camilla (good-humouredly). No, indeed, KEZLA, and believe
me, I congratulate you most cordially on your success. I could
certainly have wished But there, I mustn't scold such a
distinguished author, and after all, you have done no harm,
j you might have. Now you can go. Of course I cannot
expect you to continue your duties, but if you would kindly
mention to BEssie that we will have our coffee in the garden—
Kezia. Oh, Miss LYDE, I shall be very willing to bring out
coffee—as a friend, and perhaps you will allow me a few minutes'
interview later on with my publisher. I’m told that geniuses
can command their own prices nowadays, and he'll find out I’m
quite able to take care of myself.
She goes; a little later NorA bursts in.
Nora. CAMILLA, you'll hate me, I know, but I must tell you.
Poor Mr. BowATER is nearly out of his mind, and I feel I ought
to do something. (She makes a full confession.) Now do you
understand?
Camilla (bitterly). I understand that I have been living in an
atmosphere of bad faith and trickery and deception l (Rising.)
The best thing you can do now is to go to Fitcham and see if
you . recover that manuscript without making any more
eI.
Nora. CAMILLA, don’t be beastly about it! Where are you
oing?
g Camilla (at the door, grimly). I am going to have a little talk
with Mr. BowATER. [She goes out.

FOR NEITHER DEFENCE NOR, DEFLANCE.
(Prophetic Report of the Last Volunteer Muster.)
THE thousands of citizen soldiers stood at attention when the
General in command of them (who had just completed his work
at the Autumn Manoeuvres) made his appearance, ready to
harangue them. By the progress of science each volunteer could
hear every word that was addressed to them. No speaking-
trumpet was required, as a recent improvement in the telephone
had practically annihilated space.
“My friends,” began the warrior, “I wish I could call you my
comrades. That I cannot is no fault of mine. but must be at-
tributed to the decision of the Commission on National Defence.
So, with all possible respect, I salute you once again as my friends
—for are you not my countrymen?”
There was a murmur not altogether of approval, but the armed
mass soon relapsed into expectant silence.
“I am aware that you have spent the better part of your lives

imitated the action of their progenitors. It does you infinite
credit that you should put in so good an appearance.”
At this there was a feeble cheer. For a moment the Force
looked lively, but resumed their air of despondency as their chief
continued.
“To reach this level you have had to work hard. Nay, more,
you have had to subscribe liberally from your pecuniary re-
sources. For soldiering, either regular or amateur, costs con-
siderably more than nothing. I think I may say that the price of
the Volunteer Movement, from its inception to the present day,
must be given in tens of millions.”
At this declaration (which was uttered in a tone of proud satis-
faction) there was distinct cheering. The armed host felt that
they had received a compliment.
“And having said this, I have little more to utter. You are
aware that we are on the point of being invaded. You also know
(on excellent authority), that if 50,000, or, at most, 150,000 men
of the enemy reach our shores in safety the downfall of the
empire is a certainty. If you could be landed upon the hostile
shore you might be of some slight value. But this is impossible.
So as you are not wanted you may stand at ease—in fact stand
Relieved by this command from the statuesque front the
Volunteers had hitherto assumed, the body became more sociable.
They conversed amongst, themselves, and came to a decision.

oncer.
“Sir,” began the delegate, “you tell us we are proficient.
You say that we have cost million***
“You have,” was the prompt reply. “Had the money spent
upon your development *. expended in the reduction of the
empire's financial burden there would have been a considerable
reduction in the National Debt.”
“And yet, if I am not mistaken, you hinted that we were
quite useless.”
“Certainly—absolutely valueless.”
“Then what shall we do?” And as this question was put the
gallant warriors again became silent.
“Well, my friends,” returned the General, after a few moments
of consideration, “I really think you had better disband as a
preliminary to bidding one another good-bye, and going home to
tea.
There was a sigh, a cheer, and a rush. In a moment the citizen
soldiers scattered North, South, East, and West. And thus

in attaining your present commendable efficiency. And in doing
this you have but followed the example of your fathers, who also
i. the story of the Volunteer Movement. It ended—and
or ever.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Having read with
interest the discussion under the above |&nd no more paddlin
heading in the columns of a daily con-
temporary, I feel bound to submit to you
what seems to be a common-sense
view of the subject. Briefly, it is that no
one should be allowed to indulge in sea-
bathing, either at, Broadstairs or else-
where, except in full morning-dress, with
chimney-pot and umbrella in the case of
men, and matinée hat and sunshade for
ladies. The reason for this is obvious. If
people want to wash, they can best do so
n the privacy of their own dressing-rooms.
But the occasions when it is necessary for
them to swim are when they fall over-
board, or when the ice gives way, or at
clothes on. Consequently, that eye-sore
of British watering-places, the bathing-
machine, should be promptly a.i.

Persons desirous .# practising natation,
having, of course, previously learnt on dry
land, ought either to be pushed off a pier-
head without warning, or sent out to sea
in a boat with the cork removed from the

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I was at large the
other day, and thought I would look in at
the Royal Aquarium to see if I could pick
bathing-costume and False Modesty. Sure
enough, I arrived in the nick of time to
see a “Professor” make a sensational dive
from the roof, enveloped in a flaming sack.
Here, then, is the ideal bathing-dress. Let
everyone set the Thames or the Channel
on fire (before the next change in the

in petroleum, and simultaneously lighting
eacn other up. We should solve the ques-
tion of False Modesty at once. All the
jelly-fishes within the four seas would turn

conducted at night; and think, too, what

DEAR SIR,--It is quite time the question
of bathing-costume was settled for good
and all. I do not know what some of our
seaside resorts are coming to. The dress,
or, rather, almost undress, of the mascu-
line bathers is really shocking. This is no
place for maiden ladies where I am staying.

should be invaded by further crowds of
unappropriated spinsters. I live half a mile
from the shore, but I have an excellent
pair of field-glasses, specially bought for
the holiday season, and I declare that,
when I look through them every morning
at the scenes of mixed bathing in this
Jubilee year, I blush by the hour together.
If it is not put a stop to, I shall have to
stay here till the last trippers have gone.
Yours modestly, PRUE DE Coreham.
SIR,-What is all this ridiculous discus-
sion about, I ask? Is it because the sea-
serpent has declined to turn up, and the
big gooseberry crop has failed? When at
the seaside we are all artists, of course—
at least, I pose as one. I can't draw a
line, but I can get along with a kodak, and
manage to take a good many snap-shots
in the course of a morning. What is the
especial attraction at this time of year,
you inquire. Why, the female form divine,
to be sure; and the more of it the better.
Only let nobody be allowed to bathe in
public whose figure has not been passed by
a committee of experts. I am happy to
offer my services as judge. We flock to
see “Living Pictures” at Music Halls.
Then let us have them at the seaside, only
they should not be caricatures. That would
be an offence to the susceptibilities and
the innate modesty of BRoad STAREs.

HEARD ON THE SANDS.
“TAKE CARE You Don't FALL, DEARIE 1"
“It's ALL RIGHT, MuvKR. I se Holding BY THE WINGs 1”
ment is lacking to Sandboy Number Two, and when I unsteadily
stagger up to close the door I can see no trace of him. Doubt-
less, he, too, has sought safety in flight to the upper deck.
I have the cabin to myself. The ship is decidedly rolling. The
cabin is certainly very comfortable. And if— But no matter.
I have an .* book. Let me dispose myself to read, and
so be indifferent to the rough weather. I read, I doze, I succeed.
Veni, vidi, vici ſ. Two or three times the door becomes unhooked,
swings outward and returns with a bang. I have to struggle
with its hook and eye. Then I return, by a circuitous route, to
my couch and plump myself down again.
Outside I can hear “great guns,” the splashing and dashing of
waves emptying buckets of sea-water over the deck. I catch
sounds of lurching people, bumping people, and sliding
eople and then the rattle of tin and crockery—and I
w that if I #9 outside my cabin I shall, like Lady Macbeth's
waiting-maid, “see what I should not.” So, copying the ad-
mirable example set by Brer Rabbit, “I lay low and say nuffin.”
Guernsey.—I emerge. Grateful and fresh. Here, on deck, is
Sandboy Number Two, who says, “Splendid sea! But off the
Casquettes we did get a dusting.” By this process of “dusting”
to which he has been subjected, he seems to have had all the
colour taken out of him. But, he “comes up smiling,” and
protests he has never enjoyed himself so much—under similar
circumstances. Quick-Sandboy growls, “Deuce of a passage!
Devoutly hope we shall get to Jersey. But fancy having to come
back again!’
It is strange to remark that once in calm water, the decks,
which but a few minutes before had been clear, suddenly be-
come alive with people whose motto is “Resurgamus,” and who,
so to speak, “rise to the occasion,” from various mysterious
depths of the vessel. Pluckily, after several rounds with
Neptune, they mostly “come up smiling,” though with a visible
effort. A goodish number of them appear in all sorts and condi-
tions of unwellness, and are so changed since I last saw them,
hale, hearty, and hopeful, at Southampton, that “it would be
difficult,” as Quick-Sandboy remarks, “for even their own mothers
to recognise them.”
Guernsey islanders come on board, selling, or attempting to
sell, grapes and fruit. Their chance is a small one, and their time
limited. In another quarter of an hour we are off. We pace the
deck cheerily. Fair sailing now. “Not for long, though,” says
Quick-Sandboy, who credits the elements with any amount of
trickiness. Through glasses we inspect Alderney, Sark, the
Casquettes. The evening is turning out beautifully. Hallo!
beginning to lurch again. “Said so,” remarks Sandboy Number
Three, grimly.
Retirement to cabin; for meditation. Meditation occupies
an hour. Sandboy Number One, whose face has almost entirely
view and the commencing sun-set. St. Owen's Bay, then St.
Brelade's: lovely! “I’ve seen finer,” observes Quick-Sandboy,
disparagingly... The Lydia comes round the point, with such
majestic stateliness, in so elegant and self-contained a manner,
and so absolutely steady, that no one, seeing her now, would ever
suspect her capable of such “goings on ” as we, who have been
with her all along, can testify to. But all 's well that ends well;
and everyone is well now, and eager for the shore; and all, in-
cluding the Quick-Sandboy, heartily compliment Lydia on her
admirable conduct in the most trying circumstances over which
she could not possibly be expected to exercise any control.
St. Helier's.-Landed. Mysterious man in uniform addresses
us in a language which is uncommonly like broken French or
broken English, but is not exactly one or the other. Sandboy
Number Two interprets. Man in uniform is the conductor of
Grand Hotel 'bus, and is explaining to us that as we are “first
come" we can be “first served,” by being put into a chariot and
driven straight to the Hotel, while the omnibus is loading up.
Accepting the thoughtful islander's generous offer, we are driven
at a rapid rate along the front to the Grand. Haven't seen
Jersey for years. It has spread out right and left, but, in a
general way, 'tis much the same.
We are shown our rooms at the Grand Hotel. Sandboys
Numbers One and Two “are satisfied,” like Cor and Boz. Quick-
Sandboy, however, who has far and away the best of the three
rooms, mutters, in a depreciating tone, “Uml Yes—it will do.”
“Will he change?” No, he won't change, because he might get
a worse. We tell him it is a first-rate room ; as it really is. But
he refuses to admit it, and then wanders disconsolately about the
Hotel bewailing the tardy arrival of his bag. The Two Other
Sandboys induce him to take a turn before dinner. He consents.
“Now,” says Sandboy Number One to Sandboy Number Two,
as we stand looking out over the deep blue sea, and gazing at
bold and dangerous rocks toned to a bright purple in the last
glow of the setting sun, “now, this is worth coming any distance
to See
“Magnificent!” murmurs Number Two.
“Devonshire and Cornwall are just as fine,” growls Number
Three, º and one hasn’t got a confounded sea passage to get
at 'em.”
Suddenly he starts. “Ah!”
“What’s the matter?” exclaim the first two Sandboys, con-
siderably alarmed, while many of the promenaders make a halt,
deeply interested.
“My bag!” almost shrieks the Quick-Sandboy. And before
we can interfere, he has broken from us, dashed across the road,
and made for the hotel, where, in another couple of seconds, the
cause of his anxiety, the bag, from which he has been separated
for about the space of fifteen minutes, is once again in the arms
of its distracted owner. -
Comparing notes, the Two Sandboys own to a “don't-quite-
know-where-we-are” sort of feeling, coupled with a distrust of
our legs, while, at the same time, conscious of a whizziness in
the head, as if the works, after having been set whirring violently
round and round, were now gradually slowing down again. But,
—what cheer, my hearty! Avast, my messmates! Dinner it is!
TROP FORT!
[“Dawn-parties” are the latest fashion in France.]
'Twas the grunt of a Frenchman, I heard him complain—
You have called me too soon, I must slumber again;
Mon Dieu ! I was due at a dance on the dew
At daybreak this morning—a thing I eschew!
'Tis scarcely a mode that is très rigolo
On a series of visits at cock-crow to go; - -
Though at sunrise the ladies their friends may invite,
'Tis better to five-o'-cloquer at midnight!
For whether I wake at or sit up till five,
At that hour of the morn. I’m more dead than alive;
The milkman and burglar around may then roam :
But for me de grand matin there's no place like home!
They may say ’tis Watteau-like and full of romance
To rise with the one lark that's still left in France;
But the only engagement so early I keep
Is a duel pour rite—so once more let me sleep!
KANGARoos who ARE NEveR “BoundERs.”—The Australian

recovered its normally healthy tone, summons me to see the
Troops.

A LITTLE CUBBING.
Wednesday.—Lady Goodwork's bazaar—most enjoyable way
of spending quiet, instructive afternoon. Introduced to divinity
in blue serge at crewel-work stall—charming little brunette and
great sportswoman. Talked hunting and fishing. Said she had
caught, this autumn, salmon (or was it cod? forget which, not
having sporting proclivities myself) of twenty-five pounds, and
that she was so looking forward to hunting season. Said she
“hated men who weren't sportsmen.” Promptly lied to her,
and said I was devoted to hunting. Could see I went up im-
mensely in her estimation—was pleased. Introduced to her
father, Sir HARDRIDE FoxingtoN, who said I must hunt, with
them—was not pleased. “Come for little cubbing, next week,” he
says. Don't know what he means, but accept; doesn’t sound so
dangerous as hunting, anyhow. Ask guardedly, “Where do you
cub?” Sir H. looks astonished; so I smile, as though I had spoken
in joke; smile always safe investment in such cases. He laughs
boisterously, and says, “Come down to Hackhunter Hall; I'll
put you up all right.” Nods knowingly at me—I nod knowingly
at him. Wonder what “putting me up" means? Giving bed for
the night, or mount to enable me to cub P Must order new
breeches; haven't ridden, even in Park, for years.
Saturday.—New breeches home—uncomfortable—almost pain-
ful. Have them altered four times during day—rather worse at
end of time than at first. Can't be helped. Look up train in
Bradshaw, and practice saying “Hoic” in aggressive tones.
Haven't the faintest idea what it means, but suppose everyone
who cubs ought to make remarks of that sort at intervals: be-
lieve there is some word that comes after “Hoic" to complete
sentence, but am not sure.
Monday.—Arrive at Hackhunter Hall, and am most hospitably
received. My enslaver looking more charming than ºver.
Really think I might do worse. Think she would consent;
seemed so impressed with me at bazaar. Excellent dinner,
though pattern of plates trifle too prononcé, and drawing-room
curtains a shade too primary in colour. Talk exclusively sport-
ing—rather thin ice for me. “Got nice horse for you to-
morrow,” says Sir H., “takes hold a bit, but fine jumper.”
What does “Takes hold a bit” mean? Query, “Takes hold of
a bit,” eh? “Must start six sharp,” he adds. “Oh, not till
evening?” I say. Sir H. laughs, and calls me “a wag.” Hate
“wags”—and then full horror of situation breaks in on me—
realize that he means 6 A.M. Never heard of anything so in-
human ; felt inclined to protest, but didn't dare. Drawing-
room—music—bed.
Tuesday.--Knock at my door. Raining. Hooray! surely they
won't cub, in the wet!, “Shaving water, Sir, and will you
have your bath quite cold or—”, “Come in,” I say. “Suppose
this rain will prevent our starting, eh?” “Oh, no, Sir,”
says faithful servitor. “Master never stops for rain, nor the
young mistress neither.” Hate faithful servitor on the spot.
Of course, he can be cheerful; he hasn’t got to sit on wet saddle
in the early morning. Groan and turn over in bed again.
“You 'aven't too much time, Sir.” Wish faithful servitor
would die suddenly. Exit F. S. Dash into tub. Peep out of
window. Raining Hard: than ever, ugh Why such an ass as to
come 2 and how the deuce do you cub, anyhow P Descend stairs
—greet inamorata and Sir H. Watch them eat breakfast. I
breakfast out of tall tumbler. Sir H.'s Etonian son (little beast),
with mouth full of pie, stares at me, and says, “I say, Mr.
CRANER, you do look in a blue funk.” Could cheerfully, have
followed his funeral at that moment. “We must be off,” says
Sir H. Proceed to Hall door. Am armed with long-thonged
implement like fishing-rod. “That's your horse,” says Sir H.,

(A slightly-anticipatory Interview.)
“If there is one thing that I hate more
than another,” said the Eminent Author,
“it is being interviewed. My nature is the
most modest and retiring one imaginable.
I detest advertisements, except those of
my books; and it is monstrous that, for a
simple, unassuming man like myself, publi-
cation should involve publicity. Besides
how am I to enjoy the quiet so essential
for working out my colossal masterpieces
if my . is to be invaded in this way?
No ; I simply refuse to be interviewed by
any journalist—”
“In that case,” I said, rising to leave, “I
will not trouble you further.”
To my surprise, the Eminent Author
locked the door and placed his back against
it. “Don’t be foolish,” he said, irritably,
“and let me finish my sentence. I refuse
to be interviewed by any journalist who
devotes less than two columns to his de-
scription of my house and his eulogy of
myself. You’ve got down all that about
my modest and unassuming character?
All right; now we can get on. Please take
down all I say. The illustrious and world-
sketch is descended from an old county
family, and was born in the year—”
“Pardon me,” I interrupted, “but I
don't want all that. It’s been published
already within the last month in a dozen
papers.”
“In a dozen P” he exclaimed, angrily.
“In thirty at the very least ! In a dozen,
indeed! What do you take me for P Do
you think I am a miserable second-rate
writer who is only interviewed once a
week or so?”
I made my apologies. “But what I
wanted especially to know,” I continued,
“is the system by which your talented
books—”
“My colossal masterpieces,” he amended,
sharply.
“By which your colossal masterpieces
are put together. For I understand that
the labour of compiling them is shared by
you with a good many other persons?”
“Certainly it is,” said e Eminent
Author. “In former times, as perhaps
you remember, there was a quite absurd
idea in vogue that a writer must have a
close personal acquaintance with the scenes
and modes of life he depicted. The death-
blow to that fallacy was struck by a Manx
novelist, who enjoyed a certain repute in
plan of having his proof-sheets revised by
a dozen different people who were autho-
rities on various subjects. This, you per-
ceive, was a great improvement, as it
freed him from the necessity of having any
but the most superficial knowledge of what
he wrote about. I, however, have carried
the system further with the most splendid
results.”
“And, in fact,” I suggested, “you have
. fººd knowledge of your subjects at

“Exactly. And you will perceive that
this º facilitates the production of
colossal masterpieces. Take the work, for
instance, that I have at present in hand.
One of its most thrilling and dramatic
scenes takes place in a coal-mine. Now, I
haven’t the least idea what a coal-mine is
like, so the whole of that chapter is being
written for me by the superintendent of a
mine. Again, there is in it a delightful
little idyll of love in a Devonshire village,
and of course a large number of rustic
characters are introduced—readers always
like them. What do I know of Devon-
shire rusties? How can I learn how to dis-
place the consonants and vowels in order
to reproduce their dialect? “Go and study
them for myself,’ vou say? No, thank
you. I don't take the least interest in the
creatures. Besides, that isn't my work;
I’ve got to stav at home and be inter-
viewed. No : all that part of my book is
being written for me by a competent
Devonshire man. Then my scenery is sup-
plied by an eminent R.A., and a writer in
a ladies' fashion journal dresses my heroine.
In fact, there are about two dozen persons
inst now at work on my behalf. Owing to
this system. I can produce a new book every
three months with the least possible trou-
ble, and my income is simply enormous.”
“I congratulate you heartily,” I said.
“And now would you mind telling me
what exactly is the work which vou vour-
self do? Are you resnonsible for the plots?”
“I have been, hitherto.” the Eminent
Author replied. “But if I can only find a
specialist to supply me with them ready-
made. I shall certainly emnloy him ; it
would save so much trouble. Then I
should simnlv have to combine the mate-
rials sunnlied me by my various agents,
and could produce a colossal masterpiece
avery week. What an improvement on
the old davs, when a novelist had to do the
whole thing—plot, and character-studv,
and local colour. and scenery—himself!”
“It is indeed,” I assented. “And the
simply enormous income—vou share that,
of course, with vour collaborators?”
The Eminent Author rose. “I have told
vou enough.” he said: “and, as I said. I
hate being interviewed. I would fain be
alone—alone with the mighty thoughts
that crowd unon my master-mind, thoughts
which will delight thousands of readers, and
make my name immortal. Here are seven

though I should hardly—er—I mean to say, “Genius” is perhaps
rather an extravagant term to use.

higher level than JANE Austen or GEorge ELIot.
Bowater. Pardon me—on a different level.
Camilla. Well, but you must have ranked the author of Stolen
Sweets very high indeed, or you would not have been so unusually
enthusiastic |
Bowater (feebly). It is—er—just possible that I was—er—be-
trayed into some slight exaggeration.
Camilla. You are much too acute and conscientious, a critic
to give any praise that was not thoroughly deserved. And why
should you—when you had no reason to suppose that the author
was present?
Bowater. Oh-er—as to that, I can assure you Miss–er—STIL-

with such unerring accuracy. She must be a genius!

amilla. After all your praises? Oh, no, I know you too well
to believe you capable of such meanness as that. Such an ad-
vantage for her, poor girl, to be taken up by one so generous

of a substantial reward for her labours. (To herself.) It serves

Bowater. That I can't tell you. It was an anonymous story
which I received a few days ago, and left at Mr. ALABASTER’s on
my way here, with a note to tell him how highly I thought of it.

I'll try him. (Aloud.) How curious! The fact is, a friend of

not going to say that!
Bowater. I was. Indeed, I remarked as much to Miss WyviaN.
I felt almost certain you had written it.
Camilla (to herself). Perfectly shameless! (Aloud.) But it
was Kezia's novel that you praised at lunch, you know.
Bowater (taken aback). Er—that is so. But, for the moment,
I—I got it into my head that it was yours.
Camilla. Because of the “crudities” and “solecisms”? So
many thanks!
Bowater (distractedly). No, no, no! Look here, Miss LYDE,
the truth is, I’ve never read a single line of Stolen Sweets—there!
Camilla. I think you forget that you mentioned a scene in the
book that particularly strº r you, and spoke of its masterly style
and treatment, and all the rest of it. It seems a little singular
that you could do that if you had never read a line of it!
Bowater. If you remember, I–er—only did it by frequent
appeals to ALABASTER, who had read it.
Camilla. Then it was Mr. ALABASTER who really admired it?
Bowater. Well—er—he didn't exactly. (Helplessly.) It was
an unfortunate misapprehension—quite impossible to explain.
Camilla. You seem to find it so. Well, Mr. BowATER, I will
admit that I did take it into my head—I see now how foolish it
was to—to test the sincerity of the appreciation you were kind
enough to profess of my literary work by sending you a story
anonymously. The result has been—disappointing.
Bowater. Don't say that, Miss L.P Wait at least till I
produce this other manuscript, and I am in great hopes that I
may succeed in convincing you that—
Camilla. That it was the novel which you recognised as a
masterpiece? You may succeed in doing that, Mr. BowATER, but
you cannot persuade me that it was mine—and I will tell you
why. Mine was never sent at all. It was accidentally destroyed.
Bowater (to himself, crushed). Just my infernal luck! (Aloud.)
Oh! I–I was not aware of that.

it or not, Miss Lyde, have always felt the most fervent admira-
tion for you, not only as an author, but as a woman) could de-

Camilla. All I can see is that the consequence of your diplo-
macy has been to make a dupe of my poor KEzıA.

Camillu. What compensation will satisfy her now that you
have turned her foolish head by your praises? Unless you either
tell her the whole truth—which surely would be rather humilia-
ting for you—or else invent some pretext for throwing her over,
which I hope you would scorn to descend to, I really don't see
what you can do now except publish her book for her.
Bowater. But it's bo to be a failure. Would that be doing
her any real service?
Camilla. I'm afraid not. But, on the other hand, I believe it
would almost break her heart if she found out that her story had
been rejected, and I do ask you to spare her that.
Bowater (gloomily)...Very well. I’ve brought it on myself, I
suppose. I—I’ll publish her confounded story !

Camilla. Because of the “crudities” and “solecisms”? So
many thanks!
Bowater (distractedly). No, no, no! Look here, Miss LYDE,
the truth is, I’ve never read a single line of Stolen Sweets—there!
Camilla. I think you forget that you mentioned a scene in the
book that particularly strº - you, and spoke of its masterly style

tell her the whole truth—which surely would be rather humilia-

Bowater. But it's bound to be a failure. Would that be doing
her any real service?
Camilla. I'm afraid not. But, on the other hand, I believe it
would almost break her heart if she found out that her story had
been rejected, and I do ask you to spare her that.
Bowater (gloomily). Very well. I’ve brought it on myself, I

on this Common. No one appeared to

Aristocrats, were not accustomed to look
upon matrons, men and maidens chewing
cake by the roadside and consuming tea

nevertheless the Commoners were still
happy and contented. In the evening,
when the Common was no longer desirable

“But I say, why haven't the men of that

There was a loud explosion.

At this moment the Inspecting Officer

PROS AND CONS.
(By a Spectator and Loverof Manly Sport, thinking
it over at the ent of the Cricket Season.)
ON the field, or in the court,
Some enthusiasts agree
Pros. give us the prose of sport,
Amateurs its poetry.
He who hunts a ball for gain,
He who hits a ball for perks,
Is not of Olympic strain;
Mere “gate”-grubbing always irks.
Verily, “the play's the thing”;
But our games were followed sparsely
If the sole reward they bring
Were the classic crown of parsley.
“Gentlemen” are not all rich,
“Pros.” are often gentlemen;
And deciding which is which
Taxes sometimes tongue or pen.
Truly all play and no work
Needs a fortune in the player.
Many a sportsman's bºš to shirk
That, though at his game a stayer.
Surely there is room for all;
Lines too “hard-and-fast” embitter.
Many a wonder with the ball,
Many a bright and brilliant hitter,
Many a “sportsman” heart and soul,
With no purse of Fortunatus,
Would be kept from glory's goal
By harsh strictness as to status.
Whose the loss? The public's, surely,
And the game's. You may be bound,
Give and take, in games played purely,
Must be good for sport all round.

“DOWN SOUTH.”
At "The Grand,”St. Helier's.-Why are so many modern hotels
called “Grand”? The epithet conveys no idea of comfort; quite
the contrary. Now “comfort,” which word may be taken as
exhaustively expressive, is the one thing needful to the traveller.
Many monarchs have been styled “Grand,” but not one has been
surnamed “The Comfortable.” How well it would sound
“WILLIAM ...the Comfortable l’” A Grand Hotel may be and
º will be as comfortable as the yery snuggest of hostelries,
ut the name is against it to begin with.
At St. Helier's you are agreeably disappointed to find that
there is, at all events, nothing grand about the exterior of this
pretty châlet-like hotel. Immediately on arriving you feel your-
self at home, and the traveller failing to experience this
pleasant sensation will soon be put at his ease by the beaming
manager, who, as “a host in himself,” welcomes you with an air
of British cordiality, tempered by the French polish of la politesse
de Louis Quinze. Straightway he busies himself with your
comfort, as though the hotel, “with all its appliances and means
to boot,” had been placed on its present footing, solely and only
for your sole personal use and gratification.
M. Louis QUINZE is so delighted to see you. It is as though you
had been so long expected, and had arrived at last! What can he
do for you in some special way to prove his personal devotion?
A test of sincerity; ask him to change a cheque.
What greater test cf the confidence, begot in the heart of a
responsible man simply by your appearance, can there be than
this? He has never seen you before in all his life, and (the
cheque being changed) may never see you again. He has no
means of identifying you with the name you have given. It is
late in the evening, and, the money once in the guest's pocket,
the guest may wander out to amuse himself in the town, and may
never return. But his luggage? It may be somebody else's,
and not belonging to him at all. Or it may be an old worn-out
portmanteau, which, with its contents, would not fetch the
price of a luncheon.
Do these considerations occur to the mind of M. Louis QUINZEP
If they do, his countenance is still unclouded, not a shadow of
suspicion casts even a momentary gloom over his mobile features.
On the contrary, he is charmed by your request. Cheque!
Why, a hundred cheques if you like! Any amount' A thousand
you and your friends will first dine? Certainly we will. Dinner
first, cheque afterwards.
“Pas du tout !” says M. Louis QUINzE, in his pleasantest
manner, speaking French, which comes as naturally to him as
English, for, presumably, he is a Jerseyman, and master of even
more languages than his two native ones. “It is naturall

commentſ will you not go to dine P Is not the dinner commanded
for the three gentlemen? Parfaitement 1 & huit heures et demie?”
We announce our intention of being ready to avail ourselves of
the quiet corner reserved for us in the salle à manger, within
fifteen minutes.
And an excellent dinner it is too, with grouse, and with first-
rate wines at fairly reasonable prices. Even Quick-Sandboy is
fain to admit this, and having no fault to find with the food,
confines himself to the gloomiest meteorological prognostications.
For a few minutes we peer out into the unpromising night;
then the two Cheory Ones retire, hoping for the best, while the
Quick-Sandboy shakes his head despondently, and, with a melan-
choly “Good night,” goes moodily to bed.
Up with the lark. But, if the Jersey lark is not pressed
for time, he will not think of “rising to the occasion” in
such wretched weather. A delugel Rain giving, the island a
thorough good bucketing. Roads steaming. At breakfast,
Sandboys Numbers One and Two sustain a Mark Tapley-kind of
jollity, while, Number Three grumbles. Excellent trio. Merry
movement of first and second violins, and slow growl on vio-
loncello.
In midst of tempest we stand under verandah, to see travel-
lers bound for France and England starting in omnibuses and
flys. M. Louis QUINzE is there, directing movements of boots,
porters, conductors, and drivers, while cheerily speeding the de-
parting guests. “En voiture l’” he cries, as he dashes out,
regardless of rain “En voiture! . Good-bye!, Au revoir.”
He rushes up to a carriage to shake hands warmly with muffled
figures inside. “Bon, voyage! Bon, voyage.' Monsieur, et
Madame!” Here, with the utmost urbanity, he raises his hat,
and the rain comes down on his exposed cranium sharp as the
shower of a bath when the string has been suddenly pulled.
“Bon voyage 1" he cries, regardless of the douche. “Allez!” he
says to the driver, “Allez, Cocher! 'Urry!', 'Urry! Allez' "
Then, in a tone of determined command, gallantly waving his

ounds! You honour him by constituting him temporarily your

temps, n'est ce pas?” and disappears into the house.
Sandboy Number One, who has been making himself acquainted
with the traditions of the island, maintains that our manager did
not say “’Urry!' 'Urry!” but that he had raised the old Jersey
cry of “Harol Haro !” By referring him to this tradition, as given
in BLACK's useful Jersey Guide-Book, it is demonstrated to him
that the “Clameur de Haro” is only raised in cases of trespass on
distraint, when the full cry is “Haro ! Haro ! Haro ! & l'aide,
mon Prince, on me fait tort 1" and, after that, the case is formally
brought before three jurats on the bench with the bailiff.
Query.—In Jersey, should a traveller be unable to pay his bill
may he shout “Haro ! Haro !” &c., and be off by next boat?
Quick-Sandboy thinks it quite possible, and we recommend him
to remain in #. island, and, after we have left, try it.
Off to Eastern Station. To Pontac. Stop to visit a church.
Directed, in French, by peasants, we walk a mile to obtain the
keys. Not much to see when we’ve got 'em, “’Urry! 'Urry!”
We can't retrace a mile's-worth of steps to deliver up keys.
Happy Thought.—Knock at door ...} nearest house. Lady ap-
ars. Certainly, with pleasure, she will take care of the keys.
f course they will be called for. We reply, “Of course,”
which is a natural supposition, seeing that Sunday is close at
hand, and that, if the clergyman is not then in possession
of the keys, there will be no service. Wain will it be for him to
cry “Haro / Haro !” So yielding up the keys of the situation to
the kindly matron, we rush for the train. Note.—Everywhere
parle Français.” Also, politeness is the special characteristic of
the Jersey islander; so far, at least.
In St. Helier's it is the same thing; everywhere English-French.
Quite a friendly alliance. The Jeweller describes himself, over
his shop, ... as “Jeweller—Bijoutier.” “Butcher” is likewise
‘. Boucher,” “Shoemaker—Cordonnier,” and so forth. You can
deal with all the Jersey tradesmen in either French or English;
it is an example of “Whichever language you like, my little
dear; so long as you pay your money, you can take your choice.”
Quick-Sandboy regrets that he was not a Jerseyman, and brought
up from his earliest infancy to speak two languages with equal
facility. Alas, it is too late now ! We propose leaving him in
the island, where he can become naturalised. Offer rejected.

way to make an Echo answer. A trifle tea-gardenified; but

sea. The master of these marine revels is a stout man in bathing-

who is enjoying himself immensely and encouraging the others

By train to Goree, passing golf-links (impossible to get away
from golf-links, lawn-tennis, bicyclos, and even croquet this
summer), the Butts, and La Rocque. Charmingly picturesque,
every step of it. Then we ascend to Mount Orgucil Castle.
Here we bring joy and gladness to the heart of the warder, who
had begun to despair of any sixpences from visitors in this drown-
ng weather, which is enough to damp the ardour of the keenest
tripper. But our advent is the harbinger of luck: others arrive;
as we proceed, half-a-dozen moist sight-seers suddenly and mys-
teriously crop up from somewhere, apparently out of various
dark dungeons in the neighbourhood | the Powder Magazine.
We follow the warder, who is now our guardian and guide. The
beauty of the views from the summit of the tower is left to our
imagination in this hazy weather. We are pelted off the roof by
hail-stones.
“Lucky we're under cover,” quoth Sandboy. Number Two,
cheerily congratulating ourselves, as we descend the stair-case.
“Luckier if we’d stayed in the hotel,” growls Quick-Sandboy.

his temporary companions, about him, and in a rough, honest,
pleasant way, informs us that “by the rules he is not allowed to
make any charge,” thus delicately intimating that if our gratitude
for his services should happen to take the practical form of six-
pence a head (he avoids particularising any sum as clearly in-
consistent with his dignity), he personally would have no objec-
tion to placing the sum total to his own credit at his bankers.
The warder and his re-warders. So having bestowed largesse,
we descend the worn stone steps, every one of which contains a
small foot-bath of rain-water, then warily through mud-slush,
and so we gain the road and arrive at the little British Hotel.
WHAT THE SOUTH SEA WAVES ARE SAYING.
THE season here never begins or ends. From year's end to
year's end it ripples on like the late Poet Laureate’s “Brook.”
Men may come and men may go, but Southsea goes on for ever.
There is always plenty of “go" in Southsea. On the Clarence
Pier there is a constant sequence of melody interspersed with
the whistling of steamboats, while the white wings of the yachts
in the offing are reflected by the smart but pure costumes of the
ladies, who walk the plank without danger from morning till after
nightfaii. Nowhere can dogowners find such a fine recreation
ground for their canine favourites as on the far-famed Common,
when not occupied by the brave defenders of our country. Many
French visitors look upon the Victory in Portsmouth Harbour
as a proof of the valour of their countrymen, because NELsoN was
ºil. on board of this famous vessel. Two of the coal-hulks ad-
jacent to the Victory were borrowed from the Gaul, and never
returned. The Hard, but for the “Nut,” would be desolate of
seafaring reminiscences, inasmuch as H.R.H. the Prince of
WALEs acquired that famous Nelson Vase from the philanthropist,
who doesn't like too many public-houses. The Mayor is still

[“FoxEs MADE IN GERMANY.”—Considerable indignation is being aroused in the hunting districts
of the Midland counties, especially among agriculturists, in consequence of the importation of foxes bred
in Germany. In Bedfordshire, for instance, owing to the scarcity of cubs, and in order that sport may
be assured during the coming season, a large number of young foxes have been brought over and libe-
rated in various parts of the county. Farmers are loud in their protestations against the practice, and
allege that they are sustaining frequent and heavy losses by Reynard's nightly visits to their homesteads.
The German fox is described as being even more vicious than his English namesake.

A DIARY OF A DINNER.
Het Sloowe-Kootsch Hotel,
Amsterdam.
September 9, 1897.
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,-As we are in despair
of getting anything to eat this evening,
and want to get out to the “Stads-
schouwburg’” Theatre, or the “Panopti-
cum,” or somewhere, I venture to forward
you the annexed distressing document, in
case you can use your world-wide influence
with our Head Waiter, and induce him to
hurry up a bit. Our experiences are only
too typical of many continental dinners.
I copy the notes on my menu, and hope
they speak for themselves, and for yeurs
in high dudgeon, Z.Y.X
6 P.M.–The bell rings for table d'hôte
punctually. We, as punctually, troop into
a fine saloon. Forty-three in number, we
include French artists with black neckties
as big as sashes, German students with
raucous voices that never stop, a stray
American or two, some nondescript Britons,
and the rest “various,” in game-book.lan-
guage. We sit down.
6.10.-Enter three and a half waiters—
the fraction being a very small boy with a
large head and a swallow-tail coat down to
his heels. We decide to call them FRITz,
CARLo, HENRIK, and JAN, in accordance
with their evidently mixed nationalities.
The Head Waiter only looks on.
6.21.—FRitz arrives with the Potage
purée Croittons (I quote textually from
the menu).

consult the menu.
6.33.- HENRIK strolls round casually
with a couple of cold plates, which
6.35.-Fritz removes again, substituting
warm ones. Faute de mieur, we reconsult
the menu.
6.40.-CARLo presents me with a fork
presumably on loan. I thank him, and
enter the fact on the menu. -
6.42.-JAN turns up with Filets de Soles
Joinville pommes nat, which are speedily,
disposed of. We begin to inspect our
watches not unostentatiously.
6.51.—Clean plates, and a fresh flicker of
hope, alas! ill-founded, we now know the
bill of fare by heart, and have partially
lost our tempers. The illustration of a
Benedictine monastery on the card has by
this time ceased to interest us. -
6.55.-CARLo comes within three tables
of ours, and retires.
6.56.-JAN picks up a napkin on the
table and puts it down again, in the aim-
less manner of an “Auguste” at the circus.
7.0.—We work a rule-of-three sum to the
effect that, if two courses take one hour,
the whole dinner of seven will require
three hours and a half. This looks pro-
mising. We intimate as much to HENRIK,
who totally fails to understand Anglo-
Saxon sarcasm.
7.2.-Joy! JAN appears with Gigot,
d'Ecosse à la Dubarry. Come, we are
#. on 1 We shall have a meat break-
ast, anyhow. :
7.10.—Plates changed. The waiters eye
my notes ... especially as I am
entered as a “journalist’ in the hotel-
book. Result is that
7.14.—HENRIK hands me a fresh knife,
as a sort of peace-offering. I go through
pantomime of starving man. CARLo has
a fit behind a screen. -
7.21. — Plates removed inexplicably.
Query, is the dinner thus long drawn out,
to impress us with the importance of the
hotel, the antiquity of Amsterdam, the
general stability of the Dutch character,
or what?
7.35.—We revolve plans of arson,
larceny, letters to the Times, and
indſorácide. -
7.47.-Paupiettes de reau aur petits
pois. Further comments are needless.
7.59.—CARLo looks in upon us, and
explains that the next course is on the
way. • -
8.10.-We give it up, and leave the
room, shaking the bread-crumbs off our
laps at the rest of the table d'hôte.

And gives us the silent pride we feel

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. CHRISTIE MURRAY undertakes a
delicate and difficult task in the appraise-
ment of fellow-craftsmen in the art of
fiction. That he brings to it a cheerful
assurance is testified by the title. My
Contemporaries in Fiction (CHATTo AND
WINDUs) is somewhat elliptical for con-
veyance of the precise meaning the
author obviously has in his mind. He
does not mean, as strict interpretation of
the phrase implies, that he, Mr. HARDY
Mr. CLARK, Russell, Mr. BARRIE, and
others of whom he writes, are fictitious
characters. What is unmistakably clear
in the title is its frank egoism. Mr.
MURRAY is just the man, in other circum-
stances, to have written, Ego et Rez.
Which makes more charming his severe
rebuke of Miss CoRELLI for her “self-
approving hysteria” and his lament over
HARLEs READE's “fashion of intruding
himself on his reader.” But if he is
constitutionally, sometimes comically, ego-
tistical, there is, my Baronite assures me,
a real noteworthy Ego behind. The little
volume is, from first page to last, full of
keen, sound, informing criticism, the
literary style of its setting forth being of
Itself a delight. This sensation will per-
haps not be shared by Miss CoRELLI and
Mr. HENRY JAMEs, for the sting of dis-
E. is sharpened by the the disinterested reader songs AND THEIR SINGERS. No. XV.
Jack (singing at the top of his voice)—
“THERE's only own GIRL IN THE WoRLD For ME 1"–Popular Song.
Mr. MURRAY not only possesses critical
faculty in the highest state of training, but
that, in approaching his self-appointed
task, he has honestly endeavoured to set
aside personal prejudice.

Bowater. A very proper precaution. However—er—I'm afraid
we must give up the idea of illustrations as rather too expensive.

vide it, Sir.
Bowater. In the present case, most certainly not. Now, as to
terms. Have you thought at all what sum you would consider
Rezia. Well, I have heard of lady-novelists getting as much as
ten thousand pounds.
Bowater (aghast). But, bless my soul!
to pay you that, do you?
|Kezia. No. I wouldn't mind taking five thousand pounds for
Inline.
Bowater. I know very few authors who would. My good girl,
don't be absurd 1 Five thousand shillings would be monstrous
enough—but pounds! You really must be reasonable, you know.
Kezia. You'll excuse me, Sir, but I’m not so simple as you
think. . After all you and the other gentleman said at lunch, I
can’t help knowing my own value. However, sooner than
wrangle over it, I’ll come down to a thousand.
[BowATER rises impatiently, and goes to the drawing-room
window.
Bowater. Miss LYDE. (CAMILLA appears.) Your young friend
has made a modest demand of a thousand pounds for permitting
me the privilege of losing money and reputation by bringing out
this ridiculous romance of hers. I presume that even you will
consider that rather too severe a penalty for my—ah—offence?
Camilla (coming out). Oh, of course. I will come and speak to
her myself. - It's only that she doesn't understand these things.
[They return to KEziA.
Bowater. Miss STILwFLL, it’s perfectly impossible for me to
pay anything remotely approaching the sum you name, but I am
prepared to make you an offer of (He names the terms.) I
assure you that for—er—a first book by an unknown writer, that
is as much as you are likely to obtain anywhere.
Camilla. Indeed, KEZIA, you will be a very foolish girl if you
refuse it.
Kezia. That's your opinion, Miss. But I’m afraid your advice
isn't so disinterested as it might be. You're all for yourself,
you are l
Camilla. I’m sorry you should think so, KEZIA. I am always
anxious to help any literary beginner if I can—especially a friend.
Rezia. There was that friend of yours who trusted you with
her story to send to Mr. BowATER. When I told you just now it
had got burnt accidentally, it didn't strike me you were particu-
larly put out. Quite the contrary. It’s my firm belief you were
rather relieved than not.
Camilla (checking BowATER, who is about to interrupt, indig-
mantly). Mr. BowATER, please / Well, KEZIA, I may have had
my reasons for thinking it not altogether a misfortune.
Kezia. Ah, when parties are in the writing line themselves,
they’re not always sorry to see their rivals out of the way. But
you mayn't be best pleased to hear, Miss, that I was misinformed
about that manuscript. It appears that Cook really posted the
parcel after all, and then }.} the malignancy to pretend to me
she’d put it on the fire, and kept the secret till a few minutes
ago, just for the pleasure of getting a rise out of me, Miss
Bowater (to himself). Not destroyed If it should turn out—
But she’d never believe it now!
Camilla. Mr. BowATER, if that manuscript has reached you, I
shall be obliged by your returning it—unread.
Kezia. Well, some people have queer ideas of doing their
friends a good turn l r. BowATER, it's my wish to come to an
understanding, if possible. I'll say five hundred pounds, to oblige
you. If that don't suit you, I'll trouble you to give me my story
back, and I’ll find some gentleman who'll be glad enough to give
me my own price for it.
Bowater (promptly). Since you insist, Miss STILwell, I shall
be very pleased to meet your wishes (KEZLA's eyes light up with
triumph), and return you your manuscript as soon as possible,
with my best wishes for its success elsewhere.
Rezia. I might have known what all your fine words were
worth ! You jiàº. have it now if you went on your knees to
me! [She leaves the garden, furious.
Bowater. Thank Heaven, I've got rid of that awful girl! I
think you have her manuscript, Miss LYDE. Will you see that
she receives it? You might—er—remove the printed rejection
orm.
Camilla. Yes, we must spare her that. Poor girl, I'm afraid
there are more disappointments in store for her. But I shall not
allow her to leave me at present, if I can induce her to listen
to reason. -
Bowater. And now that it seems that your novel has come into
my hands after all—you won't really take it away from me?
Camilia. If must. You don't understand how I feel about
it. I wanted you to like it. But don't you see that, however
warmly you were to praise it now, I should never quite— It
wouldn't be the same! -

with flushed cheeks). Well, are you satisfied?

anyone would see so exactly what I was aiming at, or praise my
work so generously as you have done here, dear Mr. BowATER.

A DIALOGUE SroRY IN SEVEN PARTs,
PART WII.
ScFNE–The Garden,
Bowater. Pray sit down, Miss STILweLL. I shall be happy to
hear your views with regard to the publication of your—hem—
Stolen Sweets.
Rezia (seating herself). Well, Sir, I think you’ll agree with
me it's the sort of story that ought to have pictures.
Bowater. Pictures, eh? H'm l ah! Were you contemplating
having them—er—coloured?
Kezia (pleased). That would give the book a handsomer appear-
ance, certainly—provided, of course, it was done artistically.
Bowater (with weary irony). Perhaps you would like the illus-
trations entrusted to th. President of the Royal Academy?
Kezia. If you consider him thoroughly compitent, Sir, I’ve
no objection, I’m sure. Though I'd rather see a few samples
before deciding.
Bowater. A very proper precaution. However—er—I'm afraid
we must give up the idea of illustrations as rather too expensive.
Kezia (bridling). I should have thought myself you wouldn’t
consider expense any object with a book of real first-rate genius
—like you said yourself mine was
Bowater (to himself). I don't want to lose my temper if I can
help it! (Aloud.) Real genius, Miss STILwell, can afford to do
ºt any—er—pictorial aid.
Kezia (sharply). I suppose you mean you can't afford to pro-
vide it, Sir.
Bowater. In the present case, most certainly not. Now, as to
terms. Have you thought at all what sum you would consider
Kezia. Well, I have heard of lady-novelists getting as much as
ten thousand pounds.
Bowater (aghast). But, bless my soul!
to pay you that, do you?
Kezia. No. I wouldn't mind taking five thousand pounds for
Inline.
Bowater. I know very few authors who would. My good girl,
don’t be absurd 1 Five thousand shillings would be monstrous
enough—but pounds ! You really must be reasonable, you know.
Kezia. You'll excuse me, Sir, but I’m not so simple as you
think. After all you and the other gentleman said at lunch, I
can't help knowing my own value. However, sooner than
wrangle over it, I’ll come down to a thousand.
[BowATER rises impatiently, and goes to the drawing-room
window.
Bowater. Miss LYDE. (CAMILLA appears.) Your young friend
has made a modest demand of a thousand po for permitting
me the privilege of losing money and reputation by bringing out
this ridiculous romance of hers. I presume that even you will
consider that rather too severe a penalty for my—ah—offence?
Camilla (coming out). Oh, of course. I will come and speak to
her myself. : It’s only that she doesn’t understand these things.
[They return to KEZIA.
Bowater. Miss STILwÉLL, it’s perfectly impossible for me to
pay anything remotely approaching the sum you name, but I am
prepared to make you an offer of (He names the terms.) I
assure you that for—er—a first book by an unknown writer, that
is as much as you are likely to obtain anywhere.
Camilla. Indeed, KEZIA, you will be a very foolish girl if you
refuse it.
Kezia. That's your opinion, Miss. But I'm afraid your advice
isn't so disinterested as it might be. You're all for yourself,
you are l
Camilla. I’m sorry you should think so, KEZIA. I am always
anxious to help any literary beginner if I can—especially a friend.
Kezia. There was that friend of yours who trusted you with
her story to send to Mr. BowATER. When I told you just now it
had got burnt accidentally, it didn't strike me you were particu-
larly put out. Quite the contrary. It's my firm belief you were
rather relieved than not.
Camilla (checking BowATER, who is about to interrupt, indig-
mantly). Mr. BowATER, please! Well, KEZIA, I may have had
my reasons for thinking it not altogether a misfortune.
Kezia. Ah, when parties are in the writing line themselves,
they’re not always sorry to see their rivals out of the way. But
you mayn't be best pleased to hear, Miss, that I was misinformed
about that manuscript. It appears that Cook really posted the
parcel after all, and then }.} the malignancy to pretend to me
she'd put it on the fire, and kept the secret till a few minutes
ago, just for the pleasure of getting a rise out of me, Miss
Bowater (to himself). Not destroyed! If it should turn out—
But she’d never believe it now!
Camilla. Mr. BowATER, if that manuscript has reached you, I
shall be obliged by your returning it—unread.
Kezia. Well, some people have queer ideas of doing their
friends a good turn l r. BowATER, it's my wish to come to an
understanding, if possible. I'll say five hundred pounds, to oblige
you. If that don't suit you, I'll trouble you to give me my story
back, and I’ll find some gentleman who'll be glad enough to give
me my own price for it.
Bowater (promptly). Since you insist, Miss STILwÉLL, I shall
be very pleased to meet your wishes (KEZIA's eyes light up with
triumph), and return you your manuscript as soon as possible,
with my best wishes for its success elsewhere.
Kezia. I might have known what all your fine words were
worth ! You jiàº. have it now if you went on your knees to
me! [She leaves the garden, furious.
Bowater. Thank Heaven, I’ve got rid of that awful girl! I
think you have her manuscript, Miss LYDE. Will you see that
i. receives it? You might—er—remove the printed rejection
orm.
Camilla. Yes, we must spare her that. Poor girl, I'm afraid
there are more disappointments in store for her. But I shall not
allow her to leave me at present, if I can induce her to listen
to reason.
Bowater. And now that it seems that your novel has come into
my hands after all—you won't really take it away from me?
Camilla. I–I must. You don't understand how I feel about
it. I wanted you to like it. But don't you see that, however
warmly you were to praise it now, I should never quite— It
wouldn't be the same! - - -

QAMILLA). I’m sure Mr. BowATER has worries enough without
GERALD, but he would come!
Gerald (stiffly, to BowATER). Oh, I’ve brought you your bag.
I haven't opened it. After what you said I don't suppose you
require my services any more.
[He hands him a small black leather bag.
Bowater. There, there, my dear fellow, I was irritated. I don’t
remember what, I said, but I didn't mean it... I'm glad to have
that bag, though, it may . . . . Miss LYDE, this is the bag I left
at Mr. Arºn's this morning. It contains the story I be-
lieve, rightly or wrongly, to be yours, also a memorandum written
overnight for his benefit, and stating my opinion of the work in
no measured terms. I venture to hope that, if you would take
the trouble to read it, you could no longer doubt the sincerity
of my iration.
Camilla. Don't be rash, Mr. BowATER. Suppose the manu-
script turns out not to be mine?
Bowater. I’ll run the risk.
[He gives her the MS., which she receives with a start.
Nora (to GERALD, in the background). Why did you come back?
It's my belief you’ve made matters worse than ever!
Gerald. It is not my fault if BowATER will plunge in this reck-
less way!
Bowater (to CAMILLA, as she finishes reading the memorandum
with flushed cheeks). Well, are you satisfied?
Camilla. More—much more than satisfied. I never hoped that
anyone would see so exactly what I was aiming at, or praise my
work so generously as you have done here, dear Mr. BowATER.
I am very, very proud and grateful.
Bowater. And do you still deny me the privilege of being its
publisher?
Camilla. No, no. How could I? Where should I find a kinder
and more sympathetic reader?
Bowater. Then you forgive me for my—er—want of frankness?
Camilla (giving him her hand). If you will forget all the horrid
things I said to you about it.
Gerald (to NorA). I say, I do believe BowATER’s brought it off
after all.
Nora. Of course. I knew it would all come right. And really,
it's all my doing. “I consider I’ve managed it uncommonly well,

Waterloo, with which they have been connected for more than
eighty years, is now won every night on the stage of the Adelphi.
I have been there, and having seen the ghastly proofs, know what
I am talking about.
Mr. CHARLEs CARTwRIGHT is at the bottom of the whole thing.
If he had never been a pale-faced, deliberate villain, in a muffin-
cap, Mr. TERRIss would never have been unjustly persecuted,
would never have suffered punishment for being “the man who
struck O’IIara,” alias Mr. J. D. BEveRIDGE, and it is manifest
that the Duke would never, have been able, at a critical point,
to despatch Mr. TERRIss with a message that appears to have
decided the fate of the battle. A heavy responsibility rests,
therefore, on Mr. CHARLEs CARTwRIGHT, and, when next he visits
Paris, I advise him to adopt a heavy disguise, for our jealous
neighbours, in whose minds Waterloo is still understood to
rankle, might take strong measures with him. In these days of
the Russian alliance Siberia is a mere French department.

In the Days of the Duke is only the first of a series of stirring
ducal dramas. I may express the hope that in the rest we shall
see something more of our national hero. At the Adelphi he is
a mere flitter, a thing of no substance, and the action of the play
would get on quite comfortably without him. Somewhere I have
read that in a really good historical drama the great personage
ought not to be a very prominent figure. The audience ought to
have a pervading sense of his being somewhere in the back-
ground, controlling the action. But here, though the Duke is
unquestionably in the background, I never had the least sense of
him, he controlled nothing and nobody, and it was with a feeling
of puzzled astonishment that I eventually recognised his fine
ºl. nose (admirably played by Mr. CHARLEs FULtoN), as he
vanced to the footlights in a scarlet tunic and the light-blue
ribbon of the Garter.
But to the play. When I arrived the Prologue was half over,
and, as I had failed to secure a programme, I had at first to piece
the plot together for myself. P. that a party of British
tourists are staying at a Swiss hotel, let us say the Hôtel Beau
Séjour. The walls are lined with alpenstocks, and the open
windows command a noble view of the distant Alps. But trouble
is brewing. Colonel Aylmer has evidently disputed the landlord's
bill, and the landlord, naturally resenting this display of British
arrogance, has summoned the natives of the Canton to help him.
The Colonel is torn by anxiety. If he had not been so old and
war-beaten, I should have taken him for Mr. TERRIss. The
Colonel's wife, a young and giddy thing, much given to tears
and prayer, is also in deep distress. But Colonel Wellesley,
Colonel Aylmer's friend, is touring in the neighbourhood, and is
expected to succour his distressed countrymen. He arrives, but,
alas, too late, for the infuriated landlord (Mr. CHARLEs CART-
into his own hands, and has discharged a pistol full at Colonel
Aylmer. Judging by the appearance of the Colonel's face imme-
diately after the explosion, the pistol was charged with straw-
berry jam. The deadly preserve, however, does its work, and
Colonel Aylmer expires just as Colonel Wellesley arrives.
In the ensuing interval of ten minutes, fourteen years speed
rapidly away. NAPoleon is in Elba, and the British army, re-
leased from war-like toil, is refreshing itself at an inn near
Plymouth, which is entirely under the new management of Mr.
HARRY Nicholls. Mr. TERRiss has grown up, and is now Cap-
tain Aylmer, a romantic, pale Apollo of twenty-four. He is in
love with Dorothy Maine (Miss MILLwARD). For the fourteenth
time he asks her to marry him, and for the first time she accepts.
They retire once more “to the brook by the orchard.” But
Beveridge O'Hara has had his adventurous Irish eye on them, and
so has the Swiss landlord, who, having accepted a commission in
the British army, has been swiftly promoted to the rank of
Colonel in the Rifle Brigade. Anything more uncolonial (if the
word may pass in this Jubilee year) than Colonel Lanson I never
saw. He wears a muffin-cap and a long yellow coat covered with
black braid, and looks exactly like a little boy in an ancient
picture-book. He has, however, left his frilled drawers and his

hoop at home. The two villains conspire against Aylmer, who is
still in the orchard. In the next scene we find Miss MARIon
TERRY. She is aged about twenty-two, but this fact does not
prevent her from being Captain Aylmer's mother. Mother and
son indulge in a scene of affection, the idyllic nature of which
may be imagined when their respective ages are considered; the
villainous Lanson walks once more chin-deep in wickedness, Miss
TERRY passionately addresses the highly-coloured picture of her
deceased husband, the picture brutally refuses to answer her, and
the act ends. Still no Duke of WELLINGTON.
In the next act Paris claims us. We are all there, Captain
Aylmer, Colonel Lanson (extra-sec, not to say brut), Mrs.
Aylmer, Dorothy Maine, O'Hara, and Sergeant Harry Nicholls
Bunder, who, with Mrs. Bunder, has deserted the inn near Ply-
mouth and flown to the Seine in the scarlet coat and cape of a
Salvation Army Captain of the early part of the century. What

the masked shapes of Dorothy Maine and Mrs. Bunder. Sergeant
Bunder, it should be added, fulfils his destiny by turning up as a
Pierrot. The end of it all is that, spurred to desperation by the
French accent, they have had to listen to in the Palais Royal,
Aylmer and O’Hara fight a duel in a wood beyond the fortifica-

SEPTEMBER clouds the skies with grey,
And cold winds shiver through the rose :
Now swift and swifter every day
Draws to its dark and destined close.
But still, though wind and rain be keen,
Still are the swaying branches green.
For Summer has not yielded yet;
Still in stray gleams her tresses glow.
But, ah! with tears her face is wet,
She lingers, but she turns to go.
And on the air her whisper dies—
“Farewell, damp earth and chilly skies!

Its glamour flickers through the hall,
A sober silence holds the night.

Appear and fade about my chair.
And once again I pace with you
Through that old city, grey and worn,
Where hopes are high and hearts are true,
And life a cheerful Summer morn;
In that serene, familiar place
Where first I met you face to face.

To mar our joy in earthly things.
We trembled not, we did not hear

Your friendship cheers me yet again.
I call you, and unchanged you stand,
And thus recalled at will, you prove
That death is naught and fate is blind.
Life's brightness in your eyes, you move
Through the clear chambers of my mind.
This Nature grants, since death controls
Our breath, but not the world of souls.
| I take old OMAR from his shelf—
He knew the stars, and much beside—
“Go, live your life, and be yourself,
And take the gifts the gods provide.”
Thus still his voice strikes on our ears
Through twice four hundred rolling years.
I shall not know what none may see,
I cannot pierce beyond the stars;
I let the whence and whither be
Nor beat vain wings against the bars.
But blood still courses through my veins,
And life is mine, and hope remains.
And you, oh! friend of former days,
Be with me, make my purpose strong.
Still through the world's encircling maze
Help you my º steps along.
The last flames flicker, fade and die
Goodnight, dear friend, but not good-bye.
MEMs. FROM THE MOTE sook of AN
IMPERIAL TOAST-MASTER.
So many things to do that I must be
more methodical. What with my pictures,
my music, my preaching, my soldiering,
my naval manoeuvring, and my travelling,
have scarcely time to arrange my
thoughts about speechmaking. Shall jot
down a few memoranda to assist me in an
emergency.
Rhenish Town.—Lots about the wine
land, and what my family did in the past,
with the usual peroration.
English Field Marshal.—Talk about the
“brave English Army.” It does as well as
anything else, and doesn't commit one to
anything. Then, after five minutes, the
Launching a Ship.–Get my brother to
do this when I can. Better taste to let my
name come from him. Still, I can com-
memorate the happy event at a distance.
Mighty power on the sea. Going to outdo
Trafalgar. This kind of stuff by the ton,
and then the common-form peroration.
Entertaining a Potentate.—Gush to any
extent. Call him a War Lord, in the ho
that he will reply, “You’re another.” As
the chances are he won't flatter me, wind
up with the habitual peroration:
Annoying Bismarck.-Easily do this by
patronising him. In my speech announce
my gracious intention of supplying him
with a pint bottle of port, or half a dozen
cambric handkerchiefs, or a Dukedom, or
something of that sort. When I have
secured two or three laughs, conclude with
my old-fashioned peroration.
Any occasion.—Safe to talk about my
glorious º: the pater out
of it—and wind up as before.
And now what is my peroration. Well
I need scarcely jot that down. All that i
have to remember is that, whatever I may
say about other people in the earlier parts
of my speech, my peroration must be ex-
clusively about myself.
ALways witH Us.-The Gentlewoman
Journalist, on most intimate terms with
Crowned and Semi-Crowned Heads of
Europe; knows the dressmakers of the
better halves of the dynasties.
The Speculator, who has bought two
thousand shares in a Klondyke speculation,
and asks you to lend him eighteenpence.
The Cleric, without a living, who re-
quires a little money wherewithal to pur-
chase a parsonage.
The Damsel, who is waiting for the
return of her fiancé from South Africa.
ADVICE TO INTENDING TOURISTs. –

As first you stood and clasped my hand.
Where to stay? A. At home.

CUB HUNTING.
* Party (hunting by doctor's orders". “TELL ME, HUNTsMAN, IN THE Event of your Dogs Not killing ANY Foxes this
MORNING, WILL YOU GIVE THEM ANYTHING To EAT when THEY GET HOME 7"
ABROAD IN THE AUTUMN.
En Route, On board the Ostend boat. Talk to two plum
Prussians, probably tradesmen. Polite Prussians, as º
They have crossed from Ostend for the day, and have spent four
hours in Dover. But they have seen enough to be able to point
out to me various ridiculous features of English life. The soldiers
wear their caps on one side, and carry walking-sticks. Wunder-
bar! Foreign money is not accepted in England. The streets of
Pover are very narrow. Schrecklicht The weather is bad, the
sky is grey, &c., &c. Also the German army is the finest in the
world. Jawohl 1
. Ostend is getting empty. It is chilly and mournful. One can
imagine the feelings of the last visitor left in the place at the
end of September, after the last bather has bathed, the last
child has been dragged from his playground on the sand, and the
last locataire has been blown out of the last occupied verandah.
I am glad to leave, to avoid such a fate. Man in charge of
hotel omnibus looks like a German. Am wondering what lan-
guage, or languages, he speaks least unintelligibly, when he asks,
“Vous allez à Nuremberg, Monsieur?” Ah, that's all right.
He speaks French. “You go by the Vienna express,” he re-
marks, on arriving at the station. Oh, well, if he likes to talk in
English, that will do. So change to English. “Dies ist auch
Ihr Gepäck?” he asks in the luggage office. Can't stand that.
Both of us can't speak three languages at once. Twice three
seems like six. Must stick to one. Gently intimate this to him,
suggesting French, as we are in Belgium. #. poor man is
utterly confused. He is very obliging, he wishes to be polite,
he tries to do his best, but he is worse than ever. “Je vous
apporterai votre Gepäck,” says he, “into the Schlafwagen.” I
enter the station, I find the train, and soon after the linguistic
genius follows me. “Hier ist le petit sac de voyage,” he re-
marks, with a pleasant smile, “I put him dans le Zug.” Which
he does. As the train starts he takes off his cap and says, “Merci
bien, Monsieur, glückliche Reise, good-bye, Mister.”
Nuremberg.—Eight o'clock in the morning, steady rain, leaden
sky, factory chimneys, fog. I scramble down the wet, slippery
steps of the carriage, and find myself in a sooty, Gothic railway
station. . That is the last straw. Fifteen hours' journey, slum-
bers broken by bangs and whistles, and by a German who shares
my compartment from Cologne to Würzburg (going to bed at
midnight and getting up at five), fatigue, rain, gloom, factory
chimneys, fog——one could stand them all, but the sooty Gothic
railway station at eight in the morning unnerves one completely.
The bravest might weep. Repress a rising sob, and hurry down
into the crypt, or whatever they call it. Is it here that they
bury the defunct Eisenbahndirektor? Impossible to say. It
looks like it. Hurry along, and get rapidly up the steps into the
north aisle, and out into the churchyard. Ah, there is an omni-
bus, which is not Gothic! It carries me quickly away. -
Arrive at the hotel. It is an old building. Follow a waiter
upstairs, round a corner, along a passage, up a winding staircase,
round another corner, and along another passage. He opens a
door. Perceive a dim obscurity. Enter, feeling my way....At
last make out in the gloom that it is a rather large room, with a
very small window, facing the North, the walls being, covered
with a paper as nearly black as possible. What little light might
have struggled in at the window is kept out by a black mass
opposite—a sooty, fortified building, rising high above the hotel.
I seem to recognise it. Of course! It is the tower of our Law
Courts. I shall never get away from them. -- "
Go out to see the town. It is still raining steadily. A morn-
ing for a museum, BAEDEKER would say. So go to the Germanic
Museum. ... Whichever way I go, I get into a dim, draughty
corridor, lined with plaster casts of effigies from tombs. Tombs
are bad enough, but plaster casts of them are worse. The whole
museum is damp and draughty. No doubt by some order of the
police—an ortspolizeiliche Vorschrift—the windows are kept º:
until some fixed date, perhaps the last day of summer, according
to the calendar. On this damp, chilly, November-like day the
place suggests colds, neuralgia and toothache. Toothache! In a
country where a “Tooth-physician” operates in a “Tooth-
studio”! No, thank you! So go back to the shelter of the
hotel. Dinner at one, or even at half-past twelve, is better
than that. Robinson THE Rover.

. . . . AND I think it's a really splendid idea, ETHEL, and 1
mean to act on it at once. If it proved successful in London, it
ought to answer still better here at Dullington, where we know
overyone. It will save heaps of trouble; sending out cards does
take up so much time. So, as I mean to have a garden-party on
Monday week, instead of writing invitations, I've just sent a
º, to the Dullington º that I shall be at |P
o
me to my friends on that day. course this plan makes
provisioning rather difficult; I must take care that there is
enough to eat.
Il.
.There was quite enough to eat, ETHEL! Just fancy, I had pro-
vided tea for about a hundred people, and only Mrs. SURLEigh
and Miss SPITFIRE came—not a soul besides! Wasn't it pro-
voking? And it was so awkward, because the SURLEIGHs happen
not to be on speaking terms with Miss SPITFIRE just now.
III.
I’m more annoyed than I can tell you! Lord FitzACREs
accepted a special invitation in the kindest way, and turned up
uite punctually. But, just as we were sitting down to dinner,
there was a ring at the front door, and in walked that odious
Mr. BoundERBY, accompanied by his wife, two sons, and three
daughters. When I gazed at them in blank astonishment. Mr.
BoundERBY said that they'd heard about my new plan of not
sending out invitations, and, finding that Lord FitzACREs was
coming over to dine, they 'd settled to join our party! I was
furious, ETHEL, but what could I do? en I said that my plan
didn't apply to dinner-parties, all the BoundERBYs roared with
laughter, and pretended to treat it as a joke. Of course there
wasn't enough dinner—though there was enough to drink, too
much, indeed, for Mr. BoundERBY. . After dinner he slapped
addressed him repeatedly as “old cock!” Naturally. Uncle was
disgusted, and remarked audibly that JACK seemed to have picked
up some very queer friends. Finally, JACK lost his temper, as
well he might, and informed the BoundERBYs that, though we
weren't going to send out invitations for our next garden-party,
they might consider themselves specially invited—to stop away.
Mr. BoundERBy used horrid language, and muttered somethin
about “paying us out,” but he took himself and his family off,
which was the great thing. But it was a most dreadful evening.
IV.
ETHEL, I'm not going to try my plan any longer, and when
you’ve heard about my second garden-party, you won't be sur-
rised. At first all seemed well, about eighty guests had come,
including some of the smartest people in the county. I was re-
ceiving them in the hall, when, to my amazement, Hopkins
suddenly announced “The Ancient and Undivided Order...of
Hippopotamuses!” I thought he had suddenly taken leave of his
senses, and rushed to the front-door where he was standing—and
beheld a crowd of about two hundred labourers, dressed out in
red sashes, waving flags, and headed by a brass bandſ. Before i
had time to ask what in the world they were doing, their leader
came forward and delivered a speech. He said that he and his
“brethren” admired my democratic spirit, and acted on my 'int
in the spirit in which it was offered. º had been doubtful
where to hold their annual beanfeast, but Mr. Bounderby had
explained my new plan to them, and had told them, that I should
be delighted to see them all at my garden-party. He added that
the “brethren” took it kind of me, and would be proud to drink
my 'ealth. As Jack is a member of the Parish Council, we
couldn't afford to offend them; besides, I don't think they would
have gone if we had told them to. . And, so my dear ETHrl, they
stayed till ten o'clock that night, by the end of which time they
picked all the flowers and fruit in the garden, smashed six
cucumber-frames, and trodden the lawn bare. Qf course all my
friends rushed off, and I expect none of them will ever come near
me again! Oh, why did I ever try this abominable plan? Thanks
to Mr. Bounderby's revenge, I am the laughing-stock of the
whole county. Pity your unhappy friend, ETHEL, and be warned

Uncle hard on the back (you know how particular he is!) and
by her fate never to try these social experiments.

Hippopotamuses!” I thought he had suddenly taken leave of his
senses, and rushed to the front-door where he was standing—and
beheld a crowd of about two hundred labourers, dressed out in
red sashes, waving flags, and headed by a brass band! Before I
had time to ask what in the world they were doing, their leader
came forward and delivered a speech. He said that he and his
“brethren” admired my democratic spirit, and acted on my 'int
in the spirit in which it was offered. They had been doubtful
where to hold their annual beanfeast, but Mr. BounDERby had
explained my new plan to them, and had told them that I should
be delighted to see them all at my garden-party. He added that
the “brethren” took it kind of me, and would be proud to drink
my 'ealth. As Jack is a member of the Parish Council, we
couldn't afford to offend them; besides, I don't think they would
have gone if we had told them to. . And, so my dear ETHrl, they
sta .# till ten o'clock that *:: by the end of which time they
picked all the flowers, and fruit in the garden, smashed six
cucumber-frames, and trodden the lawn bare. Qf course all my
friends rushed off, and I expect none of them will ever come near
me again! Oh, why did I ever try this abominable plan? Thanks
to Mr. Bounderby's revenge, I am, the laughing-stock of the
whole county. Pity your unhappy friend, ETHEL, and be warned


Uncle hard on the back (you know how particular he isl) and
by her fate never to try these social experiments.

“THE SPIRIT OF THE TIME SHALL LEND THEE SPEED.”
(Sketch in a High Wind on the Sands.)
SCHOOL-DAYS IN FRANCE.
(A Memory recalled by “The Martian.”)
I HAVE been dipping into The Martian, and although somewhat
daunted by the prefatory futilities of the supposed narrator, and
perplexed by the planetary complexities of the story, I had to
succumb eventually, as, indeed, who could fail to succumb, to
the breezy and delightful charm of the real narrator, our lost
friend, GeoRGE DU MAURIER. The beautiful and versatile Barty
Josselin, I confess, leaves me cold where the fascinating Trilby
brought the tears to my eyes. It is the incidentals, the quaint
and gossipy reminiscences, the flashes of insight that delight one
here as in Trilby. And the style is the same, the simple, un-
affected style of a clever and engaging man of the woºd who,
having lived a pleasant life amongst pleasant people, possesses
in perfection the art of conversation on paper. But it is not of
the story itself or even of its style that I propose to speak. The
account of French school-life with which The Martian opens has
aroused memories of certain school-days of my own that were
passed in France, and it is on this subject that I have a few re-
marks to make.
NEARLY thirty years ago it was my good fortune to spend
some months, not at an expensive private school such as Mr.
DU MAURIER's Institution Brossard seems to have been, but
at a large French Lycée, or public school. Although I was a
small boy I had been at a big English school (they used to take
us there at a very tender age), and I had, therefore, some ex-
perience of the manners and customs prevailing among English
schoolboys. I did not know a word of French, and I cannot
say that my feelings were particularly joyous when early on a
cold winter's morning I found myself plumped down amongst
some thirty-five little French boys, who formed the Huitième,
or lowest class. Now supposing a little French boy had found
himself amongst thirty-five little English boys, I doubt whether
from his school-fellows. They ask him if he has a sister, and
what her name may be, and they receive his innocent answer
with shouts of exultant derision. They ask him if his mother
is fond of him, and receive with obdurate incredulity his affirma-
tive answer. They make his life a burden to him if he wears
an article of clothing that is not conformable to their ideas of
correctness. They inquire as to the antecedents of his father,
and express contempt if the parent's calling does not satisf
their views on social exigencies. I remember two very sm
English schoolboys in the wordy warfare which preceded a
fight, each shouting alternate, and, no dºubt, equally false,
imputations on the other's male parent. “You’re the son of a
butler,” said one, with withering scorn. “And you,” said the
other, with a fine sense of repartee, “are the son of a stationer.”
Then they proceeded to fisticuffs, and blacked one another's eyes.
For one English boy to say to another, “Your pater’s a cad,” is
always the last dread insult which immediately precedes
bloodshed.
BUT of this primitive, barbarous trait there was no trace
amongst my French companions. The little English boy who
had come amongst them was treated with the most delicate
kindness and consideration. They all did their best to help
him on, and as time passed, and he was able to recite his page
or two from FENELoN without a mistake, and in a beautiful
Béarnais accent (the Lycée, by the way, was at *. they
showed as much pride in his achievement as they would have
shown in any triumph of their own. The little boy who sat on
my left was the son of one of the local gendarmes. He wore a
blue blouse, confined round his waist by a leather belt. The boy
who sat on my right was the son of an épicier, and wore a dress
which amongst English schoolboys, would have served as a red
rag to a herd of bulls. But I never heard any of the other boys,
and many of them were the sons of gentlefolk, and were well-
dressed, make a single depreciatory remark to either of these
two with reference to the status of his father or the fashion of
his clothes. I can still remember my astonishment at the utter
absence of chaff amongst these French boys.
ON the other hand, I must confess that on certain points of
manners the behaviour of these boys left something to be desired.
In the class-room they all spat with a disgusting frequency and
regularity. At the end of the morning there was a hateful pool
on the floor at the feet of every boy. Organised games did not
exist. Even the rounders, of which Mr. DU MAURIER speaks,
were unknown. In the play-ground, those boys who were not
wandering about aimlessly or playing at horses, were always
assiduously engaged at marbles. There were several English boys
amongst us, and I remember that we tried to introduce cricket.
But we failed miserably, chiefly, I think, owing to the size, shape,
and weight of the two bats supplied to us by a local carpenter,
who had endeavoured faithfully to base himself upon. oº::
tion of the implement. We gave up the attempt to describe the
splice, and the bats we obtained were perfectly solid.
EveRY English boy was credited with a complete knowledge
of all the details of boxing. We were supposed to be blood-
thirsty and terrible fighters, and no French É. of our own size
ever willingly engaged in an altercation, much less in a con-
test, with one of us. I still seem to see one determined fight
between two of our French companions. They rushed at one
another with yells and shouts. É. seized DUVAL by both
his ears, whilst DuvAL clutched at FouquE's throat—he could
not seize his hair because it was cropped. Then they began to
shake and kick one another. Upon them thus shaking, cling-
ing, and kicking came one of the masters, a Pole, of immense
size and forbidding aspect. He seized them by their heads, tore
them apart, and §. closed his arms with a determined sweep.
I can still hear the resounding collision of those two little bullet-
heads. There was no further fighting on that day.
WE were day-boys—externes, and so far as I remember we had
to be at school for the day's work before 8 A.M. Sometimes we
went to early school breakfast, which consisted simply of a great
chunk of bread and a bowl of coffee or cocoa. en came the
mid-day meal, and at four o’clock a servant with a large basket
went round the play-ground distributing more chunks of bread.
This was called our goûter. Of the evening meal I can say
nothing, because I never, shared in it. Thursday and Sunday
were whole holidays, and on those days we used to see the

THE ETHICS OF HOUSE-CHANGE.
(Rules laid down by Peregrine Nomad.)
1. WHEN taking a new domicile accept the word of the land-
lord that the drains are in first-rate condition.
2. Buy the fixtures of the late tenant at a price over and above
that which would provide brand-new articles, such as venetian
blinds, linoleum, stair-rods, and door-scrapers.

ducted on the Constantinople or Sultan principle, are going on

whitewash. If possible, have a good piano in the drawing-room
for the artists to stand upon and use as a dinner-table or side-
board for pewter-pots.
Engage a reliable charwoman (with or without assistant) to
thoroughly purify the house after imploring the dustman to call
for the leavings of the late tenant. Mem.—These personages
must be mollified with bottled beer at no regular but very fre-
quent intervals. They are in nine cases out of ten in unholy
alliance.
6. Endeavour to get the latch-key, about which the diploma-
tist house-agents are as ignorant as the Émperor of China, they
effecting their entrance into the dwelling by some burglarious
method through the kitchen or scullery window. The late tenant
has usually jº the key as a souvenir of his sojourn.
7. Provide for the late tenant's cat, which has been left be-
hind, and refuses to quit the premises.
8. During repairs be prepared to receive calls not only from all
the local tradesmen, who have been forewarned of your advent,
but also greet with joy the rate, water, and gas collectors, who
won't believe that you are not the late tenant.
9. Overawe the local postal authorities by representing your-
self as a friend of their chief at St. Martin's le Grand, and con-
strain them into not bombarding you with letters and circulars
addressed to the late tenant.

THE ETHICS OF HOUSE-CHANGE.
(Rules laid down by Peregrine Nomad.)
1. WHEN taking a new domicile accept the word of the land-
lord that the drains are in first-rate condition.
2. Buy the fixtures of the late tenant at a price over and above
that, which would provide brand-new articles, such as venetian
blinds, linoleum, stair-rods, and door-scrapers.
3. Always warehouse your furniture while negotiations, con-
ducted on the Constantinople or Sultan principle, are going on
between yourself and the landlord; one, two, or even three
house-agents being the accredited diplomatists.
papers and execute various manoeuvres connected with paint and
whitewash. If possible, have a good piano in the drawing-room
for the artists to stand upon and use as a dinner-table or side-
board for pewter-pots.

thoroughly purify the house after imploring the dustnan to call
for the leavings of the late tenant. Mem.—These personages
must be mollified with bottled beer at no regular but very #.
quent intervals. They are in nine cases out of ten in unholy

6. Endeavour to get the latch-key, about which the diploma-
tist house-agents are as ignorant as the Émperor of China, they
effecting their entrance into the dwelling by some burglarious
method flºº the kitchen or scullery window. The late tenant
has usually taken the key as a souvenir of his sojourn.
7. Provide for the late tenant's cat, which has been left be-
hind, and refuses to quit the premises.
During repairs be prepared to receive calls not only from all
the local tradesmen, who have been forewarned of i. advent,
but also greet with joy the rate, water, and gas collectors, who
won't believe that wou are not the late tenant.
9. Overawe the local postal authorities by representing your-
self as a friend of their chief at St. Martin's le Grand, and con-
strain them into not bombarding you with letters and circulars
addressed to the late tenant.

“THE SPIRIT OF THE TIME SHALL LEND THEE SPEED."
(Sketch in a High Wind on the Sands.)
SCHOOL-DAYS IN FRANCE.
(A Memory recalled by “The Martian.”)
I HAVE been dipping into The Martian, and although somewhat
daunted by the prefatory futilities of the supposed narrator, and
perplexed by the planetary complexities of the story, I had to
succumb eventually, as, indeed, who could fail to succumb, to
the breezy and delightful charm of the real narrator, our lost
friend, GeoRGE DU MAURIER. The beautiful and versatile Barty
Josselin, I confess, leaves me cold where the fascinating Trilby
brought the tears to my eyes. It is the incidentals, the quaint
and gossipy reminiscences, the flashes of insight that delight one
here as in Trilby. And the style is the same, the simple, un-
affected style of a clever and engaging man of the woºd who,
having lived a pleasant life amongst pleasant people, possesses
in perfection the art of conversation on paper. But it is not of
the story itself or even of its style that I propose to speak. The
account of French school-life with which The Martian opens has
aroused memories of certain school-days of my own that were
passed in France, and it is on this subject that I have a few re-
marks to make.
NEARLY thirty years ago it was my good fortune to spend
some months, not at an expensive private school such as Mr.
DU MAURIER's Institution Brossard seems to have been, but
at a large French Lycée, or public school. Although I was a
small boy I had been at a big English school (they used to take
us there at a very tender age), and I had, therefore, some ex-
perience of the manners and customs prevailing among English
schoolboys. I did not know a word of French, and I cannot
say that my feelings were particularly joyous when early on a
cold winter's morning I found myself plumped down amongst
some thirty-five little French boys, who formed the Huitième,
or lowest class. Now supposing a little French boy had found
himself amongst thirty-five little English boys, I doubt whether
he would have received a very kindly treatment at their hands.
from his school-fellows. They ask him if he has a sister, and
what her name may be, and they receive his innocent answer
with shouts of exultant derision. They ask him if his mother
is fond of him, and receive with obdurate incredulity his affirma-
tive answer. They make his life a burden to him if he wears
an article of clothing that is not conformable to their ideas of
correctness. They inquire as to the antecedents of his father,
and express contempt if the parent's calling does not satisf
their views on social exigencies. I remember two very sm
English schoolboys in the wordy warfare which preceded a
fight, each shouting alternate, and, no doubt, equally false,
imputations on the other's male parent. “You’re the son of a
butler,” said one, with withering scorn. “And you,” said the
other, with a fine sense of repartee, “are the son of a stationer.”
Then they proceeded to fisticuffs, and blacked one another's eyes.
For one English boy to say to another, “Your pater's a cad,” is
tº, º last dread insult which immediately precedes
000sneol.
BUT of this primitive, barbarous trait there was no trace
amongst my French companions. The little English boy who
had come amongst them was treated with the most delicate
kindness and consideration. They all did, their best to help
him on, and as time passed, and he was able to recite his page
or two from Fenelos without a mistake, and in a beautiful
Béarnais accent (the Lycée, by the way, was at *...' they
showed as much pride in his achievement as they would have
shown in any triumph of their own. The little boy who sat on
my left was the son of one of the local gendarmes. He wore a
blue blouse, confined round his waist by a leather belt. The boy
who sat on my right was the son of an épicier, and wore a dress
which amongst English schoolboys, would have served as a red
rag to a herd of bulls. But I never heard any of the other boys,
and many of them were the sons of gentlefolk, and were well-
dressed, make a single depreciatory remark to either of these
two with reference to the status of his father or the fashion of
his clothes. I can still remember my astonishment at the utter
absence of chaff amongst these French boys.
ON the other hand, I must confess that on certain points of
manners the behaviour of these boys left something to be desired.
In the class-room they all spat with a disgusting frequency and
regularity. At the end of the morning there was a hateful pool
on the floor at the feet of every boy. Organised games did not
exist. Even the rounders, of which Mr. DU MAURIER speaks,
were unknown. In the play-ground, those boys who were not
wandering about aimlessly or playing at horses, were always
assiduously engaged at marbles. There were several English boys
amongst us, and I remember that we tried to introduce cricket.
But we failed miserably, chiefly, I think, owing to the size, shape,
and weight of the two bats supplied to us by a local carpenter,
who had endeavoured faithfully to base himself upon our descrip-
tion of the implement. We gave up the attempt to describe the
splice, and the bats we obtained were perfectly solid.
EveRY English boy was credited with a complete knowledge
of all the details of boxing. We were supposed to be blood-
thirsty and terrible fighters, and no French boy of our own size
ever willingly engaged in an altercation, much less in a con-
test, with one of us. I still seem to see one determined fight
between two of our French companions. They rushed at one
another with yells and shouts. É. seized DuvAL by both
his ears, whilst DuvAL clutched at Fouque's throat—he could
not seize his hair because it was cropped. Then they began to
shake and kick one another. Upon them thus shaking, cling-
ing, and kicking came one of the masters, a Pole, of immense
size and forbidding aspect. He seized them by their heads, tore
them apart, and then closed his arms with a determined sweep.
I can still hear the resounding collision of those two little bullet-
heads. There was no further fighting on that day.
We were day-boys—externes, and so far as I remember we had
to be at school for the day's work before 8 A.M. Sometimes we
went to early school breakfast, which consisted simply of a great
chunk of bread and a bowl of coffee or cocoa. en came the
mid-day meal, and at four o'clock a servant with a large basket
went round the play-ground distributing more chunks of bread.
This was called our goûter. Of the evening meal I can say
nothing, because I never, shared in it. Thursday and Sunday
were whole holidays, and on those days we used to see the
boarders (internes) dressed in their képis and their uniform coats
parading two and two in a long and melancholy line under the eye
of an usher. Still, we enjoyed ourselves, as boys will anywhere,
..r

Even a freshly-arrived little English boy has to suffer much
and our enjoyment reached its height when a perfectly baseless

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A FLAvour of the peculiar humour of
DickeNs, and a spice of the melodramatic
power of WILKIE Collins are to be found
in W. W. JAcobs' two stories, The Skipper's
Wooing and The Brown Man's Servant,
respectively, bound together in one book,
recently published by PEARson, Ltd. . The
first of d. is in the delightful vein of
the same author's Many Cargoes. But,
amusing as it is, there are plenty of
“laughs” in it, a rare quality in any author
now-a-days, it would have been con-
siderably improved had it been less evi-
dently spun out. The second story seems
as if it had been originally intended to be
self disinclined or unable to finish. Mr.
JAcoBs should continue it, and give us the
thrilling story of The Lost Diamond, or
whatever title he liked to give the con-
tinuation of the tale. Anyhow, every
reader, will, like the recipient of Sam
Weller's artistic love-letter, “wish as there

THE NEW DRAMA AT OLD DRURY.
First and foremost congratulations to Messrs. Raleigh and
HAMILtoN, authors, secondly, to Mr. Arthur Collins, Managing
Director of Old Drury, and then to the company generally on the
success, thoroughly deserved, of The White Heather. “Come
heather! Come heather! Come heather!” and that the public
responds to the invitation is evident from the crowded, almost
over-crowded state of the house, which is, nightly, quite a “con-
gested district.”
The melodrama is remarkable for three things. . First, its
capital dialogue (when not melodramatic); secondly, for the a
pearance of Mr. HENRY NEville as a smiling villain of the
yellowest-reddest dye; thirdly, for the , excellent musical-
rionic assistance of Mr. GLovER in the orchestra; and
lastly, for the admirable acting of Mrs. John Wood, which is
beyond all praise. Were all the iron-work machinery to collapse
(as in fact one night it did, and the theatre had to be closed),
the drama could go on, as its mainstay, its chief support, is
Wood. Subtract. Mrs. John Wood, and pop goes this melo-
drama. When Mrs. Wood, at the end of the Battersea Park
scene, takes the heroine to her arms, to the intense delight of
entire audience, and after seating her in her carriage, delivers a
speech on the domestic virtue of woman, finishing up by an
* to everyone as to “what is the proper place for woman?
and answering her own question by shouting to her coachman,
“Home!” there is universal cheering for the space of nearly
two minutes, during which time “all mortal shapes are lost in
gloom,” for the house is enveloped in cimmerian darkness,
and only the shadowy form of the musical magician, Mr.
GLovER, is faintly visible, as, báton in hand, he urges his wild
demon orchestra, who are struggling, with all their powers of
wind and string, against the deafening applause that only sub-
sides when the bright gas-light once again illumines the stage,
showing a new scene, and the audience, hushed unwillingly into
an expectant calm, find themselves gazing on the heavily-fur-
nished, crimson-dyed abode of the supremely wicked nobleman,
trigue that is to grow more and more diabolically interesting
every minute.
Alas! Poor Mr. HENRY NEville, the once gay, chivalric,
breezy cavalier' has it come to this? that, in becoming a wily
aristocrat, he is forced to get himself severely, yet popularly,
disliked by a Drury Lane audience, within sound of the curtain-
raising bell of the Olympic Theatre, where once he was cheered
to the echo as the long-sufferin ticket-of-leave man!" And what
a finish to a glorious career! To be attired in a diver's dress,
to have his mobile features and fiery eyes entirely hidden under
a diver's helmet about the size of a huge comic pantomime head,
which has not even the stupidly fixed humorous (or otherwise)
expression that a pantomime mask is condemned in perpetuity
to wear, and thus attired he is let down into the depths (what a
“let down” it is!), there to struggle with ropes, but with no lines
to say, to grope about in an aimless kind's way, to be attacked
by another diving demon, his very counterpart, as humorously
attired as himself, and finally to have his wind-pipe (that is, the
pipe through which the wind is supplied to the diver) cut, and
to fall without a last dying speech, without a word, without a
curse, for no expression of hate or of any other sentiment can be
seen under that porpoise-like diver's helmet! To think, too, that
this melancholy end should raise just an audible titter among
the audience, which might even swell into a guffaw were it not
that the man in ther right place, 'yclept. Mr. GLovER, ener-
getically comes to the rescue, and commanding a great banging

it were, the big drum-stick, and there's an end of the Wicked
Nobleman'
How the boat which brought poor HENRY Neville ascends

“GUNNING WITH A SMELL DOG.” -
(B. Jonathan, Esq., having missed a Hare, the Dog drops to the shot.)
B. J. (scornfully). “CALL THAT A Good DAwg?
I RECKON HE
AIN'T worth CANDY I WHEN THE BEAst 's sirTING, HE stands
AND Looks. At HIM ; AND when HE RUNs Away, HE LIEs Down AND
Looks AT ME 1"
BRowNE looks in a peculiarly unobtrusive white knickerbocker
cycling-costume; how self-effacing is the unfortunate heroine,
Miss KATE RoRKE, with not much to say and still less to do; how
life-like is the Stock Exchange scene; how supremely good is the
very tall lover, Mr. DAwson MILwARD, whose motto should be,
“Love me little, love me long”; how striking is the performance
of the diving Myles-na-Coppaleen sort of tºother lover, Mr.
RoRERT LoBAINE ; how excellently played are all the minor parts,
it is impossible, within these limits, to recount. But thinking
over it, it is difficult to imagine what the fate of this melodrama
might have been but for the vigorous, timely, and tunely assist-
ance of Hand-and-Glover in the Orchestra, and the quite in-
valuable services of Mrs. Wood on the stage. Everybody will
flock to the Lane to see the Wood.
SKETCHES IN LONDON.
II.-IN My LADY's CHAMBER.
MR, and Mrs. WILtoN have been married siz years; they are quite de-
voted to cne another; there are, however, two small clouds on the
matrimonial horizon. One is on Mr. WILTox's side, a fitful but
determined predilection for occasionally passina the greater part of
the night in talking Socialism with a Fabian friend—a recreation to
which his wife entertains an unsurmountable objection; while, on the
other hand, Mrs. Wilton has a violent but as yet ungratified desire
to hold a stall at a Fancy Fair; the one amusement against which
Mr. WILtoN has a roo’ed prejudice. The scene opens at three o'clock
in the morning in Mrs. WILton's Louis Seize bedroom. It is one of
the occasions on which Mr. WILtoN has ignored her disapproral of
his Socialistic views. Feigning a reverie, and, with what she calls
his “irri'a'ing absent glare,” he had fled, vaguely, to the house of
the demo-ratic friend. She has slept comfortably since 9:30, and on
being awoke by the sound of the hall-door at three, she rises hastily,
fresh for the discussion. She is setted on a curved sofa, in a pink-
flowered dressing-gown, her golden hair in a plait tied with black
ribbon, pretending to knit something undecided for her little boy. By
the rose-shaded light she wears an expression of holy, saint-like resig-
nation that is decidedly unsuited to her rather babyish features. Mr.
WILtoN enters very softly in evening dress. He starts rm seeing her,
her being awake, when he notices her little Sèvres clock ticking rather
reproachfully on the table, side by side with a circular cbout the Home
Jor Deserving Cats, and also a list of the Lady Patronesses ºf the
Bazaar to be held, shortly, at the Victoria Hall. Mr. WILtoN is
abou', a year older than his wife, fair and boyish-looking. His name
is THEodore; hers is MURIEL.
Theodore (with self-reproach concealed under assumed anger).
MURIEL! what on earth have you been doing?
Muriel (sweetly). Waiting for you, dear. As I couldn't sleep,
I thought it best to do a little work for Baby.
Theodore (steeling himself). This is absurd—childish How
often have I requested you not to sit up P Go to bed at once
(He yawns.) -
Muriel. Oh, THEoDoRE! do you really think it worth while?
Baby will expect me to play with him when he comes down at
seven. And it is rather late—isn't it?
Theodore (bursting into an explosion, prepared beforehand in
case of a scene, with a view to obtaining his liberty once for all—
but not waiting for his cue). There! That’s the way! That is
how wives make their husbands wretched with these continual
reproaches—
Muriel (apologetic). I beg your pardon, THEopore. I thought
it would seem rude not to notice you coming in. I really only
said it was late out of politeness.
Theodore. Then you carry your manners to excess.
Muriel (in a self-denying tone). It doesn't matter, my sitting
up a little late. I knew you were happy. Besides, I should have
had time to rest a little in the day before your mother's dinner,
if the CLAVERING girls weren't coming to lunch. However, never
mind, dear. If your mother says I’m pale, I can always say I
have a headache—can't I?
Theodore (touched and disarmed, but determined to finish the
explosion). You know, MURIEL, it is just that constant fault-
finding, these scenes, that drive a man to prefer other hearths to
his own. {{*: flower out of his coat.
Muriel (in surprised voice). Really! I thought you dined at
Mr. RALston's; and I’m sure his hearth is perfectly hideous—
the most horrible tiles, representing nursery rhymes. I can't
think why; perhaps because he's a democrat, or vegetarian, or
something. However, if you enjoyed it—
Theodore. I didn't enjoy it. (Becoming suddenly apologetic,
and losing ground.) I got into a discussion, dear. I’m sorry if
I was late. (Pause.) Look here ! You shall have those furs you
wanted. Would you like them?
Muriel. Oh! no. I couldn't take them. Thank you very
much, dear, all the same. I’m having my chinchilla done up.
Theodore (rather relieved, mildly). Oh! you’d better have them.
Muriel. THEoDoRE, if you really want to please me—Lady
GwendoLINE has written to me again about the bazaar
Theodore (frowning). What bazaar? I never heard of it.
Muriel (pathetically and appealingly). For the Home for De-
serving Cats! They want me to hold a stall—a flower-stall. Do
let me! Dear THEoDoRE!
Theodore (firmly). No! There I draw the line ! I have always
had a particular dislike to-to my wife going about begging
people to buy from her—selling to strangers! Never!
Muriel. But I wouldn't, really—I wouldn't sell a thing, dear!
And it's for such a good charity. I was brought up to be kind to
animals. The whole thing is simply to amuse the cats.
A tear. THEODoRE wavers.
Theodore. And a fancy-dress, I suppose?
Muriel. Well, dear, everyone's going to wear them. And I'm
afraid I should attract attention if I wore an ordinary dress. I
don't think, myself, it's very wise to single oneself out for remark
in that sort of way in a public place—do you? Mamma was always
so particular about anything of that sort, so perhaps I’m over-
sensitive about it. And it’s a very simple little dress. Just a
little skirt, you know. No train or anything showy.
Theodore (tired). I disapprove strongly, MURIEL.
Muriel (kissing him, delighted). Oh! thank you, dear! How
sweet of you ! It is so nice to feel one's doing a little good in
the world. Besides, of course I wouldn't hold any stall but a
flower-stall—that's so different. Lady GwBNDolin E will be
pleased. Dear THEopore! And now, promise me never to go and
talk socialism with Mr. RALston again!
Theodore (asleep). Never! I swear it!

Brown. “I wish I HAD THE MoRAL courage to Go Home!”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In Kedar's Tents (SMITH, ELDER) is a
story by which Mr. MERRIMAN more firmly
establishes a still fresh but brilliant repu-
tation. It bustles along through scenes
full of local colour, this time the palette
supplied from Spain, a country he seems
to know intimately. The tale is full of
adventure, and, happily, it is carried on
by real men and women. Of the two
sexes the author is, in this instance, more
successful with his men than his women.
Padre Concha, the priest, who ought to
have been a soldier; Concepcion. Vara,
the light-hearted guide; General Vincent,
the Royalist leader; and Fred Conyngham
the hero of the book, who lounges in an
out of direful dilemmas, are each in their
diverse ways admirable.

It is
doubtless accidental; but if Mr. MERRI-
MAN had chanced to have been intimately
acquainted with the gallant horseman of
Khiva, the unconventional Colonel of the
Blues, suspicion would become a certainty.
It is part of the coincidence that FRED
BURNABY spent some months in Spain
fighting for DoN CARLos.
In Shakspeare the Boy (CHATTo AND
WINDUs), Mr. RolfE has pursued a very
ingenious plan. An earlier author, in an
analogous dilemma, took his fence at a
stride. “Snakes in Iceland” was the head-
ing of his chapter. “There are none.”
comprehended its contents. Mr. Rolfe,
proposing to record what is known of SHAK-
speARE's boyhood, might honestly have
fulfilled his task by writing, "Nothing.”
As a matter of fºie produces a pleasant,
picturesque work of over 200 pages, lim-
|ning a vivid picture of daily life at Stratford
during the term of SHAKsp EARE's boyhood.
Having done this, all that remains is to
surmise that “little WILLIAM "...saw this,
or must have heard that, and there you
are. There are many illustrations, in-
cluding a portrait of a saintly boy, which
may (or may not) be reproduced from a
photograph taken as “we may imagine
young WILLIAM wending his way to the
Grammar School for the first time on a May
morning in 1571.”
Mr. H. G. WELLs should have given
himself more time, and thought, for the
development of a very original idea. The
Invisible Man (published by PEARSoN,
Limited) is amusingly written, and here
and there its reader will pause to indulge
in audible guffaw or irresistible chuckle.
But the fanciful tale is not well worked out
the interest soon ceases, and what should
have been from first to last a screamingly
extravagant absurdity, gradually fizzles
out in tragic splutter. espite this, the
story is well worth reading.
As to Mr. HALL CAINE’s new book, The
Christian, all I can find to say, to those
hesitating whether to read it or not, is, -
If you have absolutely nothing at all to do;
if you have no newspapers, no library, no
books of any sort (including Bradshaw's
Guide); if there be no pack of cards handy,
or even a solitaire board; if, on a pouring
wet day, you are dying for want of someº
thing to irritate you into healthy action,
then, should you discover a copy of The
Christian anywhere about, . it up
and try it. Impossible to answer for
the consequences, but if you are of an iron
will and able to control your passions up
to a certain point, you will, despite the
wretched weather, pull on your thickest
boots, struggle into your driest water-
proof, and rush out of the house as if you
were ABEL running away from CAINE.
Everyone to his taste, and it is reported
that the book has had a wonderful sale.
Certainly, if this be so, the sale is indeed
wonderful, and the fact shows how bad the
weather must have been in various parts
of the country. By the way, can any one
of its “fifty thousand” readers, including
Dean FARRAR, who apologises for the au-
thor and quite loses whatever point there
may be in the story, explain why it is
called The Christian?

SKETCHES IN LONDON.
II.-IN My LADY's CHAMBER.
MR. and Mrs. WILtoN have been married siz years; they are quite de-
voted to rme another; there are, however, two small clouds on the
matrimonial horizon. One is on Mr. Wiltox's sid”, a fitful but
determined predilection for occasionally passina the grea'er part of
the night in talking Socialism with a Fabian friend—a recreation to
which his tº entertains an unsurmountable objection; while, on the
other hand, Mrs. WILtoN has a violent but as yet ungratified desire
to hold a stall at a Fancy Fair; the one amusement against which
Mr. WILtoN has a roo’ed prejudice. The scene opens at three o'clock
in the morning in Mrs. Wilton's Louis Seize bedroom. It is one of
the occasions on which Mr. WILtoN has ignored her disapproral of
his Socialistic views. Feigning a reverie, and, with what she calls
his “irri'a'ina absent glare,” he had fled, vaguely, to the house of
the demo-ratic friend. She has slept comfortably since 9:30, and on
being awoke by the sound of the hall-door at three, she rises hastily,
fresh for the discussion. She is setted on a curved sofa, in a pink-
flowered dressing-gown, her golden hair in a plait tied with black
ribbon, pretending to knit something undecided for her little boy. By
the rose-shaded light she wears an expression ºf holy, saint-like resig-
nation that is decidedly unsuited to her rather babyish features. Mr.
WILtoN enters very softly in evening dress. He starts rm seeing her,
her being awake, when he notices her little Sèvres clock ticking rather
reproachfully on the table, side by side with a circular cbout the Home
for Descrwing Cats, and also a list of the Lady Patronesses ºf the
Bazaar to be held, shortly, at the Vuctoria Hall. Mr. WILtoN is
about a year older than his wife, fair and boyish-looking. His name
is THEodon E ; hers is MURIEL.
Theodore (with self-reproach concealed under assumed anger).
MURIEL! what on earth have you been doing?
Muriel (sweetly). Waiting for you, dear. As I couldn't sleep,
I thought it best to do a little work for Baby.
Theodore (steeling himself). This is absurd—childish How
often have I requested you not to sit up P Go to bed at oncel
(He yawns.)
Muriel. Oh, THEoDoRE! do you really think it worth while?
Baby will expect me to play with him when he comes down at
seven. And it is rather late—isn't it?
Theodore (bursting into an explosion, prepared beforehand in
case of a scene, with a view to obtaining his liberty once for all—
but not waiting for his cue). There! That's the way! That is
how wives make their husbands wretched with these continual
reproaches—
Muriel (apologetic). I beg your pardon, THEoDoRE. I thought
it would seem rude not to notice you coming in. I really only
said it was late out of politeness.
Theodore. Then you carry your manners to excess.
Muriel (in a self-denying tone). It doesn't matter, my sitting
up a little late. I knew you were happy. Besides, I should have
had time to rest a little in the day before your mother's dinner,
if the CLAVERING girls weren't coming to lunch. However, never
mind, dear. If your mother says I’m pale, I can always say I
have a headache—can't I?

explosion). You know, MURIEL, it is just that constant fault-

his own. ſº flower out of his coat.
Muriel (in surprised voice). Really I thought you dined at
Mr. RALston's; and I’m sure his hearth is perfectly hideous—
the most horrible tiles, representing nursery rhymes. I can't
think why; perhaps because he's a democrat, or vegetarian, or
something. However, if you enjoyed it—
Theodore. I didn't enjoy it. (Becoming suddenly apologetic,
and losing ground.) I got into a discussion, dear. I’m sorry if
I was late. (Pause.) Look here ! You shall have those furs you
wanted. Would you like them?
Muriel. Oh! no. I couldn't take them. Thank you very
much, dear, all the same. I’m having my chinchilla done up.
Theodore (rather relieved, mildly). Oh! you’d better have them.
Muriel. THEoDoRE, if you really want to please me—Lady
GwendoLINE has written to me again about the bazaar
Theodore (frowning). What bazaar’. I never heard of it.
Muriel (pathetically and appealingly). For the Home for De-
serving Cats! They want me to hold a stall—a flower-stall. Do
let me! Dear THEoDoRE!
Theodore (firmly). No! There I draw the line ! I have always
had a particular dislike to-to my wife going about begging
people to buy from her—selling to strangers! Never!
Muriel. But I wouldn't, really—I wouldn't sell a thing, dear!
And it’s for such a good charity. I was brought up to be kind to
animals. The whole thing is simply to amuse the cats.
[A tear. THEoDoRE wavers.
Theodore. And a fancy-dress, I suppose?
Muriel. Well, dear, everyone's going to wear them. And I'm
afraid I should attract attention if I wore an ordinary dress. I
don't think, myself, it's very wise to single oneself out for remark
in that sort of way in a public place—do you? Mamma was always
so particular about anything of that sort, so perhaps I’m over-
sensitive about it. And it’s a very simple little dress. Just a
little skirt, you know. No train or anything showy.
Theodore (tired). I disapprove strongly, MURIEL.
Muriel (kissing him, delighted). Oh! thank you, dear! How
sweet of you ! It is so nice to feel one’s doing a little good in
the world. Besides, of course I wouldn’t hold any stall but a
flower-stall—that's so different. Lady GwendoLINE will be
pleased. Dear THEoporte! And now, promise me never to go and
talk socialism with Mr. RALston again!

THE KAISER's SABBATH.
The President of Westphalia has issued an edict
forbidding indulgence in shooting, dancing, º
acting, and similar recreations, on a Sunday. In
the next column of the paper in which this edict is
published, there is an account of the KAIs ER's
shoot with the Emperor of AustralA at Totis on the
previous §§.
HAD I been born in WILLIAM's land
By some malicious lot,
To bless his bust, or lick the dust
Whereon his chargers trot.—
Were I, in fact, of German make,
which, thanks to luck, I'm not;
I’d sing a grace composed by him
Each time I broke my bread,
And every night sit up and cite
His latest speech in bed,
And have his allegory hung
Beside my slumbering head.
I’d go, to ease his mighty heart,
Serenely to the block,
And toast his name and fabulous fame
Above my final bock,
Remarking in my gaoler's ear
“Hoch to the ER, hoch!”
I’d face the axe, or rope, or else
The new electric gear,
And º”. to death, though short of breath,
Uplift a loyal cheer,
shout terrifically, Dying How any sheep of all the flock
Marked by the KAIsrR's brand
Can care to brave the lightest wave
Of that majestic hand,
Is more, considerably more,
Than I can understand.
Yet there is one so brazen-faced,
A bold Westphalian he,
Who rudely went, without consent,
And issued a by-decree,
A private Sunday law to suit
is own locality.
“None shall,” he said, “on Sabbath-day .
Indecorously run
To skittles or dance or games of chance,
Or shooting with the gun,
Nor kill of even dogs so much
As just a little one.”
For here, with other sports profane,
A tendency was found
To hunt the big domestic pig,
The pig so ripe and round,

THE SEVEN STAGES OF LITERARY SUCCESS
Illustrated by Cuttings from the Scrap-book of a Popular Author.
STAGE THE FIRST.
“A Star of Dawn, by a hitherto unknown author, Mr. JonAs
Goord, places him at a single bound in the foremost ranks of
contemporary novelists.”—Daily Oracle.
. “An epoch-making book, instinct with consummate and irre-
sistible genius.”—Areopagus.
." A cheering sign of the times is the extraordinary enthusiasm
with which A Star of Dawn has been received by the Press and
Public. It proves that really great work is invariably sure of
instant recognition.”—Chanticlere.
“The author is evidently only on the threshold of his brilliant
career . . . . We shall await his next work with breathless
interest.”—Trumpeter.
StAGE THE SEconD.
“The numerous public which thrilled and shuddered, wept and
laughed over that marvellous book, A Star of Dawn, will not be
disappointed by its successor, The Meridian. Here are the same,
&c., &c., only richer, more matured, better held in restraint.
Hºnº's the finest novel of the century.”—Friday Flam-
oyant.
“We laid down the book with a feeling of positive reverence
for the intellect which could conceive and carry out to a success-
ful issue so stupendous a design. . . here can be no further
doubt about it. The Meridian bears on every page the imprint
of the master-hand.”—Discriminator.
STAGE THE THii:D.
We hear that Mr. Goord has been giving sittings of late to
Mr. FitzJohn MELBURY, the well-known R.A., and the portrait,
when completed, will be one of the chief attractions of the forth-
coming Academy.”
“Mr. GooBD, the distinguished novelist, is perhaps the best-
interviewed man living. He has been compelled to set apart
two days a week entirely for the purpose of gratifying the in-
satiable curiosity of the public respecting his personality and
“Mr. Goord is now leading a life of almost complete seclusion
at John o' Groat's, where %. is engaged in putting finishing
touches to his forthcoming novel, Brutum Fulmen. Those who
have been privileged with a peep at the proofs, report, &c., &c.
Mr. GooBD complains bitterly of the manner in which his privacy
has been invaded by cyclists and representatives of the Press.”
“It is said that Mr. Goord has received the magnificent offer
of £– down for his next novel. This is the largest sum ever
offered for any work of imagination. Mr. Goord is considering
the proposal.”—Paragraphs (various).
STAGE THE FourTH.
“Mr. Goord's new novel, Brutum Fulmen, contains all the
qualities with which he has made us accustomed in his previous
erformances...Perhaps he has nothing particularly new to say—
indeed, it is difficult to avoid a certain impression of- &c., &c.
. . . . . Still, when all is said, it is indubitably the novel of
the year.”—Moderator.
“What hope is there for Literature when a stupid and sheepish
Public receives with gaping avidity such pretentious bombast as
the works of that over-rated novelist, Mr. JonAs Goord P’—
Weekly Iconoclast.
“We have never been carried off our feet by the flood of some-
what hysterical admiration for Mr. Goord's undoubted talents,
and we see nothing in Brutum Fulmen to lead us to alter, &c.”
—Tepidarium.
“It is really time that Mr. GooBD struck out some new vein.”
—Athenian Mercury.
STAGE THE FIFTH
“In Fiasco, Mr. Goord has essayed an entirely new departure.
. . . . Unfortunately, he cannot be congratulated We re-
commend him to return without delay to the earlier methods by
which he won his very considerable reputation.”—Athenian
Mercury. - -

tion among the novels of the current month.”—Morning Milk.

writing which obtained for A Star of Dawn and The Meridian a
#. popularity with the more unthinking section of the
Public. is is a pity, because in Fiasco he #. a decided
capability for better things.”—Daily Oracle.
“After Fiasco, which in some respects was quite a remarkable
novel, Sunset comes as a distinct disappointment. We fear that
Mr. Goord is inclined to take himself too seriously.”—Athenian
Mercury.
“Sunset is quite unworthy of the pen that wrote that uneven
but far from contemptible novel, A Star of Dawn, and is not a
patch upon the same author's Fiasco. However, it is entitled to
mention as one of the novels of a by no means remarkable week.”
—Flamboyant.
“When the author produces something which has more claims
to be treated as Literature than Sunset can boast of, we shall be
happy to É. it a more extended criticism than this brief para-
graph. Meanwhile, we gladly pass on to the next in our batch
of ephemeral productions.”—Summary Review.
“We hear that Mr. Goord, the celebrated novelist, is com-
É'. by reasons of health, to reside abroad in future, and that
is unrivalled collection of antique tapestries, Louis Quinze furni-
ture, and other objects of Art, will shortly be seen at CHRISTY's.”
StAGE THE SEVENTH.
“Afterglow, by J. Goord, is a thoroughly well-written novel,
like everything else that proceeds from this cultivated and con-
scientious artist. It will be greatly liked.”—Lubricator.
“Mr. Goord's facile pen has given us another of his pleasant
books. It is quite up to the level of anything he has done
hitherto.”—Daily Oracle.
“If we have allotted to Afterglow more space than its import-
ance strictly deserves, our excuse must be the real pleasure which
its perusal afforded us.”—Trumpeter.
“An excellent little book to take up in an idle half-hour when
there is nothing else to do.”—Discriminator.
“Will appeal to a large circle of readers, and give much inno-
cent pleasure.”—Areopagus.
“The author's name seems familiar, somehow, though there is
nothing on the title-page to indicate that Afterglow is not a
maiden effort. If so, É. (or she) may be congratulated and
encouraged to persevere in the hope that some day, &c.”—
Chanticlere.
Post-scRIPTUM.
(Extract from Letter to Jonas Goord, Esq., from his Publishers.)
DEAR SIR,-We propose, with your consent, to clear out the
whole of the remainder copies of Afterglow at waste-paper prices,
as we find it impossible to dispose of the edition on more favour-
able terms.
Trusting that this arrangement will meet with your approval,
we are, &c., &c.
“IN GLOBO.”
... YALE University must be a pleasant place for a quiet student,
if, whenever two Yaler Boys meet a third, they immediately pro-
ceed to hoist him off his legs, wildly carry him about, before
depositing him recklessly anywhere, all the while shouting,
“Yale ! Yale I Yale!” as a sort of war-cry, in addition to yell-
ing a verse of something or other, more or less unmusical. Such,
as above stated, is the startling conduct of Messrs. HARRY
REEves-SMITH and ARTHUR PLAYFAIR representing “Students
of Yale University, U.S.A.,” showing the way they have in the
'Varsity” of giving a welcome to their fellow-student, Frank
Staynor (played by Mr. WEEDoN GRossMITH), on his arrival at
“Miss FitzALLEN's house in New York city.”
The fun of this bustling piece culminates in the third act,
which, as rarely happens in such farcical pieces, is the best of the
three. Mr. MICHAEL MoRton, author of “Miss Francis' of
Yale, seems to have had WEEDoN GRossMITH in his eye, and to
have seen pretty clearly how he could best suit him. Through
two acts the unfortunate WEEDoN is battered, banged, bumped,
thumped, frightened by everyone in turn, greatly to the delight
of a sympathetic audience, until, in the last, he retires for the
night, only to be treated worse than ever, and have his nerves
shattered #. short but sharp thunderstorm. Messrs. REEves-
SMITH and PLAYFAIR hunt in couples, and, when not engaged in

improbable, the above-mentioned clever canine imitation is
artistically given by that sly dog, Mr. LITTLE, when, as Uncle
FitzAllen, hiding under a bed, he treats the enraptured audience
to a specimen of how he can imitate a dog's yapping, doin
it, too, in a most convincing manner, until , driven out o
his ambush by several whacks from a poker in the vigorous
hands of Miss ETHEL Hope, impersonating Miss Mann. If this
be so, special compliments are due to Mr. LITTLE:
As Soaper, the eccentric melodramatic butler, Mr. KINGHoRNE
is capital. Miss MAY PALFREY and Miss SPENCER BRUNToN are in
pleasant contrast with one another as the two sweet sisters
FitzAllen. Neither has much to say, and not very much to do:
There is some character in the part of the merry widow, played
by Miss HELEN FERRERs, who shares with Cosette (Miss FERRAR):
the French maid, the best chances in the piece. “Miss Francis"
has, it appears, made a decided hit; but it is not within measur-
able distance of Charley's Aunt. sharp, short, brisk throughout,
it succeeds in keeping an audience interested and amused for just
two hours.

[According to the experience of Mr. Cooper, the retiring Birmingham
registrar, the “boom” in cycling has been coincident with the boom in
matrimony.]

THE SEWEN STAGES OF LITERARY SUCCESS
Illustrated by Cuttings from the Scrap-book of a Popular Author.
STAGE THE FIRST.
“A Star of Dawn, by a hitherto unknown author, Mr. Jonas
Goord, places him at a single bound in the foremost ranks of
contemporary novelists.”—Daily Oracle.
“An epoch-making book, instinct with consummate and irre-
sistible genius.”—Areopagus.
..".A cheering sign of the times is the extraordinary enthusiasm
with which A Star of Dawn has been received by i. Press and
Public. It proves that really, great work is invariably sure of
instant recognition.”—Chanticlere.
“The author is evidently only on the threshold of his brilliant
career . . . . We shall await his next work with breathless
interest.”—Trumpeter.
StAGE THE SEcond.
“The numerous public which thrilled and shuddered, wept and
laughed over that marvellous book, A Star of Dawn, will not be
disappointed by its successor, The Meridian. Here are the same,
&c., &c., only richer, more matured, better held in restraint.
Hºnº's the finest novel of the century.”—Friday Flam-
oyant.
“We laid down the book with a feeling of positive reverence
for the intellect which could conceive and carry out to a success-
ful issue so stupendous a design. . . . There can be no further
doubt about it. The Meridian bears on every page the imprint
of the master-hand.”—Discriminator.
STAGE THE THii:D.
“We hear that Mr. Goord has been giving sittings of late to
Mr. FitzJohn MELBURY, the well-known R.A., and the portrait,
when completed, will be one of the chief attractions of the forth-
coming Academy.”
“Mr. Goond, the distinguished novelist, is perhaps the best-
interviewed man living. He has been com É. to set apart
two days a week entirely for the purpose *::::::::: the in-
satiable curiosity of the public respecting his personality and
“Mr. GoorD is now leading a life of almost complete seclusion
at John o' Groat's, where i. is engaged in putting finishing
touches to his forthcoming novel, Brutum Fulmen. Those who
have been privileged with a peep at the proofs, report, &c., &c.
Mr. GooBD complains bitterly of the manner in which his privacy
has been invaded by cyclists and representatives of the Press.”
“It is said that Mr. GooBD has received the magnificent offer
of £– down for his next novel. This is the largest sum ever
offered for any work of imagination. Mr. Goord is considering
the proposal.”—Paragraphs (various).
STAGE THE FourTH.
“Mr. Goord's new novel, Brutum Fulmen, contains all the
qualities with which he has made us accustomed in his previous
rformances...Perhaps he has nothing particularly new to say—
indeed, it is difficult to avoid a certain impression of- &c., &c.
. . . . Still, when all is said, it is indubitably the novel of
the year.”—Moderator.
“What hope is there for Literature when a stupid and sheepish
Public receives with gaping avidity such pretentious bombast as
the works of that over-rated novelist, Mr. JonAs Goord?”—
Weekly Iconoclast.
“We have never been carried off our feet by the flood of some-
what hysterical admiration for Mr. Goord's undoubted talents,
and we see nothing in Brutum Fulmen to lead us to alter, &c.”
—Tepidarium.
“It is really time that Mr. GoorD struck out some new vein.”
—Athenian Mercury.
STAGE THE FIFTH
“In Fiasco, Mr. Goord has essayed an entirely new departure.
. . . . Unfortunately, he cannot be congratulated . . . . We re-
commend him to return without delay to the earlier methods by
which he won his very considerable reputation.”—Athenian
Mercury. - -
“We should be inclined to award to Fiasco a prominent posi-
tion among the novels of the current month.”—Morning Milk.
“Fiasco is quite unlike anything its author has written before,
and we venture to express a hope that the experiment will not

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
STAGE THE SIXTH.
“In Sunset, Mr. Goord attempts a repetition of the sort of
writing which obtained for A Star of Dawn and The Meridian a
temporary popularity with the more unthinking section of the
Public. This is a pity, because in Fiasco he showed a decided
capability for better things.”—Daily Oracle.
“After Fiasco, which in some respects was quite a remarkable
novel, Sunset comes as a distinct disappointment. We fear that
Mr. GooBD is inclined to take himself too seriously.”—Athenian
Mercury.
“Sunset is quite unworthy of the pen that wrote that uneven
but far from contemptible novel, A Star of Dawn, and is not a
patch upon the same author's Fiasco. However, it is entitled to
mention as one of the novels of a by no means remarkable week.”
—Flamboyant.
“When the author produces something which has more claims
to be treated as Literature than Sunset can boast of, we shall be
happy to give it a more extended criticism than this brief para-
graph. eanwhile, we gladly pass on to the next in our batch
of ephemeral productions.”—Summary Review.
“We hear that Mr. Goord, the celebrated novelist, is com-
º'. by reasons of health, to reside abroad in future, and that
is unrivalled collection of antique tapestries, Louis Quinze furni-
ture, and other objects of Art, will shortly be seen at CHRISTY's.”
STAGE THE SEVENTH.
“Afterglow, by J. Goord, is a thoroughly well-written novel,
like everything else that proceeds from this cultivated and con-
scientious artist. It will be greatly liked.”—Lubricator.
“Mr. Goord's facile pen has given us another of his pleasant
books. It is quite up to the level of anything he has done
hitherto.”—Daily Oracle.
“If we have allotted to Afterglow more space than its import-
ance strictly deserves, our excuse must be the real pleasure which
its perusal afforded us.”—Trumpeter.
“An excellent little book to take up in an idle half-hour when
there is nothing else to do.”—Discriminator.
“Will appeal to a large circle of readers, and give much inno-
cent pleasure.”—Areopagus.
“The author's name seems familiar, somehow, though there is
nothing on the title-page to indicate that Afterglow is not a
maiden effort. If so, he (or she) may be congratulated and
encouraged to persevere in the hope that some day, &c.”—
Chanticlere.
Post-scripTUM.
(Extract from Letter to Jonas Goord, Esq., from his Publishers.)
DEAR SIR,-We propose, with your consent, to clear out the
whole of the remainder copies of Afterglow at waste-paper prices,
as we find it impossible to dispose of the edition on more favour-
able terms.
Trusting that this arrangement will meet with your approval,
we are, &c., &c

... YALE University must be a pleasant place for a quiet student,
if, whenever two Yaler Boys meet a third, they immediately pro-
ceed to hoist him off his legs, wildly carry him about, before
depositing him recklessly anywhere, all the while shouting,
“Yale ! Yale l Yale !” as a sort of war-cry, in addition to yell-
ing a verse of something or other, more or less unmusical. Such,
as above stated, is the startling conduct of Messrs. HARRY
REEves-SMITH and ARTHUR PLAYFAIR, representing “Students
of Yale University, U.S.A.,” showing the “way they have in the
'Varsity” of giving a welcome to their fellow-student, Frank
Staynor (played by Mr. WEEDON GRossMITH), on his arrival at
“Miss FitzALLEN's house in New York city.”
The fun of this bustling piece culminates in the third act,
which, as rarely happens in such farcical pieces, is the best of the
three. Mr. MICHAEL MoRToN, author of “Miss Francis' of
Yale, seems to have had WEEDoN GRossMITH in his eye, and to
have seen pretty clearly how he could best suit him. Through
two acts the unfortunate WEEDoN is battered, banged, bumped,
thumped, frightened by everyone in turn, greatly to the delight
of a sympathetic audience, until, in the last, he retires for the
night, only to be treated worse than ever, and have his nerves
shattered § a short but sharp thunderstorm. Messrs. REEVEs-
SMITH and PLAYFAIR hunt in couples, and, when not engaged in
bullying WEEDON GRossMITH, are flying for their lives from

invisible artist outside, whose name does not appear in the play-

“Don't You Think the LUTHERAN SERVICE sweet?"
“I Don't THINK I KNow IT.
ALL MINE is SkVEEs.”
THINGS THEY DO BETTER IN HOLLAND.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-May I send you
some random notes of a flying visit to the
land of dams and polders? ey are some-
what disconnected, and require sorting,
much as does the writer after a rough sea-
passage in one of the Zeelandsche Stoom-
vaart Maatschappij's excellent boats.
In the first place, there is no scenery to
waste time over in Holland. A landscape,
the ingredients of which are canals, cows,
and wind-mills, saves a lot of trouble, if
you keep a sketch-book. One horizontal
line, surmounted by a row of X's, gives
you a perfect picture of the Zaanland with
its forest of saw-mills.
You can get an excellent seat in the
stalls of a theatre for three shillings or so,
with a penny for the programme. When
will the London theatres follow suit, and
let us see a piece in comfort at a reason-
able price? Then the opera is sung in
Dutch, so you are not bothered with listen-
ing to the absurdities of the libretto, but
can devote all your attention to the music.
The Amsterdam Zoo people are most
considerate to their four-legged and
villa to himself, with reception and bed- |
rooms, and apparently a kitchen, pantry,
and coal-cellar in the back premises.
Double-fronted, detached house; sanita-
tion excellent; hot water throughout ;
balcony lounge, together with extensive
playground, and “all that messuage”;
standing in its own premises, and com:
manding romantic views of duck-pond and
band-stand; keeper, gardeners, garden &.
duce, and perquisites, all inclusive. Only
the language of the house-property adver-
tisements in our esteemed contemporaries'
columns can do it justice.
The sands at Scheveningen are well pro-
vided with “wind-stoels,” or wicker-work
portable seats with hoods. Put two of
these together face to face, and #. can
have a tête-à-tête as long as you like, or
until they tip over.
Then in the Kurhaus they have invented
and adopted a new means of gambling,
called “ $º Pool,” apparently P.
nowhere else. You can get rid of your
guilders much faster this way than at
little horses,” and as the chances are
less in your favour, you will soon be cured
of the taste for such games of chance. The
about an inch and a half in diameter, on
to a sort of long, flat trough, with eight
shallow depressions in it. Two of these are
marked red, two are blue, and the rest 1,
2, 3, 4, successively. You win twice your
stake on the red or on the blue, and four
times on the numbers, having previously
indicated which you will play on, red, blue,
or a number. I say, you win; or at least,
I hope so. I didn't.
The elderly ladies do their best to arrest
and amuse the observant eye, by wearing
copper helmets of mediaeval design at the
back of their heads, with small, gold
blinkers or frontlets at their temples, and
surmounting the whole with a modern
black bonnet with sprays and feathers. A
few of such head-dresses in London would
make a walk down Bond Street highly
interesting. -
In the Oude Kerk at Amsterdam you
see a notice that smoking in church is
forbidden; but that, by way of consola-
tion, the 119th Psalm will be sung through
as a “voorsang.” The latter, with a ser-
mon an hour and a half long, is in keeping
with the lengthy hotel dinner given you
recently. But I am straying from my
text, and will therefore conclude with
“tot weórziens!” (which, I believe, is the
Dutch au revoir).
Yours micelanº,

SPORTIVE SONGS.
A disappointed Epicurean, whose lady-love will
not “name the day,” consºles himself on
Michaelmas Day.
HoPE against hope is still the tale
That's told from day to day,
While sunlight fades and skies grow pale,
O'ercast with shadows grey.
The Winter-snow is very near,
The cold is coming fast
On cutting winds; and yet, my dear,
You will not say, “At last!”
You will not see the Summer's fled,
And may not, come again,
Nor recognise the year is dead,
While we two yet are twain.
You little reck of bitter grief
Caused by your fickle troth.
And, 'mid the falling of the leaf,
You think of one, not both !
The birds that sang to us in Spring
Have hushed their joyous strain,
Or taken flight on Southern wing
For Africa or Spain!
The swallow now prepares his flight,
For travel is agog,
And bids to us a long “Good-night !”—
He loves not English fogl
Still birds are left about the nest,
Birds that are passing fair,
The sprightliest and daintiest
That ever breathed our air;
Birds, such as you, who love to be
Uncaged, too prone to roam,
And live the life that they deem free
By never seeking home.
But there's one bird, I love her well,
I'll meet that bird to-night,
And on her many charms will dwell,
And make her my delight.
She shall for you atonement make,
And an exquisite excuse;
Of her I wish you could partake—
She is my wonted goosel

Question. What is your mission in life?
Answer. To discover causes of discord,
and remove them.
Q. Give an instance of your occupation
in action.
A. I strongly object to the celebration
of the anniversary of the victory of Tra-
falgar, because the event might offend the
French.
Q. Then do you object to the name of
WELLINGTON ?
A. Certainly, except in its connection
with boots.
Q. And what about Waterloo?
A. It should disappear as a name of a
place, a bridge, or an omnibus.
Q. Would you honour NAPOLEoN with a
statue?
A. In theory.
Q. Why not in practice?
A. Because the effigies of public men in
England may, unfortunately, turn out to be
insults perpetuated in marble or bronze.
Q. Would you celebrate any date in con-
nection with the Spanish Armada?
A; Certainly not; more especially as the
incident is said to have occurred so long
ago that it is to be hoped that it may not
be true.
Q. Would you retain a remembrance of
the names of any of our battles with the
French P
A. Only those which we had lost—for
instance, Fontenoy.
And what would you do about

Q. Then you would establish the pres-
tige of our lively neighbours at the expense
of the reputation of our own troops?
A. Undoubtedly; and thus prevent our
country drifting into war.
% And you consider that this plan of
self-depreciation is conducive to propitia-
tion?
A. I do ; and consequently it is my
great regret that there is an unfortunate
bar to the attainment of my object.
Q. What is that, in your eyes, unfortu-
nate bar?
A. That my words and actions are im-
perfectly understood by our neighbours

Q. Is this a curse?

may consider it a blessing.

but not the translation of it. Looks as if it meant “stove,”
but that is Ofen. Am still meditating when I nearly fall over a
step. Then understand what a Stufe is. Fine instance of Ger-
man paternal government. No doubt most foreigners, gazing at
this word, are on their hands and knees before they know what
it means. If there were no placard their eyes would be at
liberty to see the step.
Ramble round the Castle, and ALBERT DURER's house, and the
Museum of Instruments of Torture—which contains some instru-
ments of music, but no barrel-organ—and then good-bye to the
factory-chimneys, the fog, and the Gothic railway station. The
train leaves the latter reluctantly. It is a very slow train.
Cannot imagine how they manage to have so many accidents in
Germany when they go at this pace. Wonder the passengers
don't get out and walk. Safer and quicker.
If you like a slow train,
You will find one in Spain;
For dawdling combined with disaster,
You'll be suited as well
In a Zug, far from schnell—
Be smashed, while a bike would go faster.
Rothenburg.—At last arrive. For the moment it is not raining.
Round the town. A delightful old place. Every house pic-
turesque. The Herr Bürgermeister ină his fellow-citizens keep
their beautiful old town mediaeval, and yet clean and in good
order, a combination which hardly any other Town Council has
ever attempted. Then the rain begins again. If any one wished
to make a fortune he should start somewhere in Bavaria an
immense shop for the sale of waterproof clothing. If properly
puffed, his establishment would in time supply every man, woman
and child with macintoshes, &c. Everyone would wear a Gummi-
Mantel, a Gummi-Hut, and Gummi-Schuhe. Can't stand damp
mediaevalism any longer. Must go where there are cabs, cafés,
theatres, and tramcars to shelter one.
So off to Munich, this time in a Schnellzug, which is very full.
There is a dining-car in the train. Capital' After dining at
Rothenburg at 12.15, could manage a second dinner about 7.30.
Quite a civilized hour. So at that time, with a good appetite,
change to the Speisewagen. Am crushed by the astounding in-
formation that everything has been eaten l Not even a roll left.
At once feel a still better appetite. The waiter tries to console
me by saying that we arrive at Munich at 9. By the time I can
get supper at the hotel it will be 9.30—two hours hence. Spend
the remaining hour and a half in the train opposite a weary little
old lady and a restless man. Probably he is also starving. The
o'd lady seems to desire repose—probably after a good meal.
Sle lies down on half the length of the seat, and closes her eyes.
The restless man yawns, pushes his hat back, pulls it forward
again, wriggles, kicks. He must be hungry. Old lady opens her
eyes, sits up, puts on a large pair of spectacles, looks sadly
around, and tries to go to sleep again. Should feel more sorry
for her if I thought she were also starving. Wonder if she
has any biscuits in her little hand-bag. How to obtain one f
Impossible if she is asleep. Otherwise might get into conver-
sation and arouse her sympathy. She does not rest long. Her
neighbour jumps up, and flops down again. This movement
shoots the old lady into a sitting posture. She opens one eye
and sighs. Restless man, in a paroxysm of energy, throws about
his arms, as though he were using dumb-bells. Old lady opens
both eyes, gazes nervously at his moving arms, sits as far away
as she can, and asks me how much longer it is to Munich. Ah,
now is my chance! I tell her there is another hour. She gasps.
Restless man bolts out into the corridor, and is seen no more.
Perhaps he is gnawing a napkin in the useless Speisewagen. As
soon as he has gone, the old lady falls asleep again, and all hope
of a biscuit vanishes. Starve steadily to Munich.

ABROAD IN THE AUTUMN.
Nuremberg.—Still raining. Still cold and foggy. Have
finished museums. What next?' Churches. To the Laurenz
Kirche. Very dark inside. Walk slowly round choir. Perceive
on the floor a small placard inscribed “ *{. Stop and look
at it. My German wants brushing up. Remember the word,
but not the translation of it. Looks as if it meant “stove,”

man paternal government. No doubt most foreigners, gazing at
this word, are on their hands and knees before they know what
it means. If there were no placard their eyes would be at
liberty to see the step.
Ramble round the Castle, and ALBERT DURER's house, and the
Museum of Instruments of Torture—which contains some instru-
ments of music, but no barrel-organ—and then good-bye to the
factory-chimneys, the fog, and the Gothic railway station. The
train leaves the latter reluctantly. It is a very slow train.
Cannot "... how they manage to have so many accidents in
Germany when they go at this pace. Wonder the passengers
don't get out and ºf: Safer and quicker.
If you like a slow train,
You will find one in Spain;
For dawdling combined with disaster,
You'll be suited as well
In a Zug, far from schnell—
Be smashed, while a bike would go faster.
Rothenburg.—At last arrive. . For the moment it is not raining.
Round the town. A delightful old place. Every house pic-
turesque. The Herr Bürgermeister and his fellow-citizens keep
their beautiful old town mediaeval, and yet clean and in good
order, a combination which hardly any other Town Council has
ever attempted. Then the rain begins again. If any one wished
to make a fortune he should start somewhere in Bavaria an
immense shop for the sale of waterproof clothing. If properly
puffed, his establishment would in time supply every man, woman
and child with macintoshes, &c. Everyone would wear a Gummi-
Mantel, a Gummi-Hut, and Gummi-Schuhe. Can't stand damp
mediaevalism any longer. Must go where there are cabs, cafés,
theatres, and tramcars to shelter one.
So off to Munich, this time in a Schnellzug, which is very full.
There is a dining-car in the train. Capital' After dining at
Rothenburg at 12.15, could manage a second dinner about 7.30.
Quite a civilized hour. So at that time, with a good appetite,
change to the Speisewagen. Am crushed by the astounding in-
formation that everything has been eaten! Not even a roll left.
At once feel a still better appetite. . The waiter tries to console
me by saying that we arrive at Munich at 9. By the time I can
get supper at the hotel it will be 9.30—two hours hence. Spend
the remaining hour and a half in the train opposite a weary little
old lady and a restless man. Probably he is also starving. The
o'd lady seems to desire repose—probably after a good meal.
Sle lies down on half the length of the seat, and closes her eyes.
The restless man yawns, pushes his hat back, pulls it forward
again, wriggles, kicks. He must be hungry. Old lady opens her
eyes, sits up, puts on a large pair of spectacles, looks sadly
around, and tries to go to sleep again. Should feel more sorry
for her if I thought she were also starving. Wonder if she
has any biscuits in her little hand-bag. How to obtain one?
Impossible if she is asleep. Otherwise might get into conver-
sation and arouse her sympathy. She does not rest long. Her
neighbour jumps up, and flops down again. This movement
shoots the old lady into a sitting posture. She opens one eye
and sighs. Restless man, in a paroxysm of energy, throws about
his arms, as though he were using dumb-bells. Old lady opens
both eyes, gazes nervously at his moving arms, sits as far away
as she can, and asks me how much longer it is to Munich. Ah,
now is my chance! I tell her there is another hour. She gasps.
Restless man bolts out into the corridor, and is seen no more.
Perhaps, he is gnawing a napkin in the useless Speisewagen. As
soon as he has gone, the old lady falls asleep again, and all hope
of a biscuit vanishes. Starve steadily to Munich.

AN INTERVIEW.
tained the privilege of an interview with Mr. SloggingtoN BLow-
Frog, the |. of those novelists who have “arrived.” On my
announcing myself at his front door, he at once took refuge in
flight, and it was only after a heated chase that Iran him down
in the cupboard beneath the kitchen stairs, a very pretty apart-
ment, which the author has fitted up for the reception of blocks
of waiiend and Silkstone, Derby Brights, and other mineral
products of a like nature.
“Perhaps, if you are so averse to being interviewed—,” I
began, but a frown on the great writer's brow arrested me.
No,” he said, “don’t go. You see, a little chase after me
lends an added zest to the interviewers keenness for copy. And
now let us start in the customary manner. No, I am not a
writer by birth. I studied originally for the profession of dust-
man, and followed that calling for several years with, perhaps
I may be allowed to say, considerable success. I am #.H. to
think that nothing is more likely to fit one for the production of
fin de siècle literature than dust collecting and the constant
association with garbage of all kinds. It is a great qualification
for the work of the modern ‘hill-top,” novelist. What did the
public think of my Three Monkeys in the Dusthole f" he broke off
suddenly. “Realistic, wasn't it?” Then, pensively scratching the
tip of his ear with a fork, he resumed, “It was a work in which my
wife helped me very materially. Of course that adds greatly to
the value of anything one writes nowadays: in fact, it is almost a
sine quá non-ah, fº. you don't speak Spanish? forgive
me—that the (interviewed) writer should be helped by his wife.
Wifely help is all the ‘go’ just now. How do I work, you ask?
Well, I usually rise at midnight, eat a hearty meal of tea and
shrimps, then work till about 4 A.M. . . . My favourite seat
whilst at work? Oh, I usually sit in the scullery sink. By the
way, you might like these few photographs of me, in various
attitudes, for reproduction in your journal. Too many to carry?
Very well, I’ll have them packed in a crate and sent on by
CARTER, PATERson. But to resume. At 4 A.M. I go for a ride on
It was not without a certain amount of difficulty that I ob.
my bike, or play shove-halfpenny for an hour with the milkman
round the corner; then I return and go to bed Excuse me a
moment.” And my host picked up a richly-jewelled inkstand,
and hurled it, with marvellous precision, through the window at
a black Tom-cat on the lawn. “And now please go. I have to
work at fifteen different magazine stories. You see, the public
will have the lion of the hour—for just so long as he is the lion
of the hour, bien entendu—pardon me, perhaps you don't under-
stand Italian? ... My next great work? Well, I need hardly
tell you that all novels nowadays must be of low life, and no
º: more aristocratic than Lambeth should be dealt
with. A strong incident in my new book is the marriage of BILL
BugGINs, the Labour agitator, who despises capital, vested
interests and personal eleanliness, to the proud but consumptive
Russian Princess QRFußkoRFr. And now, will you take a pot of
four ale? No? Well, then, goodbye. Don't put in a lot of
compliments about my personal º or my house, or
wife, or dog—— By the way, that dog was presented to me by
one of the Crowned Heads. . . . No, I sha’n’t tell you which—
who brought him all the way from Leadenhall Market on a string.
You won't put in any compliments, will you?”
“Certainly not, if you—”
“Ah, you take me too literally,” interrupted the great novelist,
hastily. “Do just as you like about it,” and a pleasant smile
lit up the mobile face with its rolling eye and massive nose, in
which the rich, red blood shows, boldly and perpetually at the
tip. “And now,” he concluded º fingering a hea
paper-weight, “ if you don't go, i Shai have to treat you as
treated Thomas le noir. Again, pardon me for using the dead
languages.”
And keeping an eye on my genial host, I left the room—
backwards.
THE betrothal was recently announced of the Princess THEobora
of Saxe-Meiningen (the home of the celebrated theatrical troupe)
“to Prince HENRY XXX. of Reuss.” An “Ex-Prince" is of no
great value, but a Prince who is “treble X.” must be a strong
potentate—quite a quart-pot-entate.

MRs. Robert JocelyN's Only a Love Story (HUTCHINson) is,
to be more precise, several love stories. But they all centre
round the Lady Veronia Brackendale, and my Baronite does not
wonder, for she is a charming girl. In the end, she marries de-
cidedly the best of her troop of admirers. The plot is not very
profound, but it is unfolded in sprightly fashion, illumined by
many flashes of keen insight. T. iterary style is deplorably
slipshod. Possibly this is a subtle touch of art, being in keeping
. the style in which women write confidentially about each
other.
To wile away the tedium of a railway journey, let me confi-
dently recommend A Studio Mystery, by FRANK AUBREY, pub-
lished by JARRold AND SoNs. It is pocketable, honestly, and clearly
printed, two excellent qualities in a book to be selected as the
£ompanion of your evening journey } rail, “when the lights are
low"; moreover, it is a mystery which the genuine romance-
reader will penetrate at once, though to ascertain the means
whereby discovery is brought about will keep him thoroughly
interested to the end. By the very fact of the mystery being
made so clear, the reader is, from time to time, put off the right
track, and is inclined to think that he must 'be mistaken."ft
belongs to the series called “The Daffodil Library,” which sounds
a bit aesthetic ; but do not be put off by this. To those fond of
a “sensation,” the Baron says, “Read A Studio Mystery.”
Perpetua, by BARING Gould, is an interesting novel, to which the
author-actor-manager who carries The Sign of the Cross trium-
phantly all over the country, should turn his attention when in
search of another ecclesiastical-dramatical subject for a new Early
Christian play. He will do well, however, at the same time, to con-
sult WISEMAN's Fabiola, NEwMAN's Callista, and, to be accurate in
details, Rossi's work on the Catacombs. He may also follow Mr.
BARING Gould's example, and, after selecting certain passages
blank verse, should he have a talent for this impressive style, and
then ºp. place the lines in the mouth of the excellent,
but slightly prosy, Bishop Castor. Perhaps BULwRR's Last Days
of Pompeii may also be of some assistance. If only the simple ques-
tion as to the origin of evil with which Friday posed Robinson
Crusoe could have been brought in, and answered satisfactorily by
Castor, then this novel would obtain a world-wide repu-
tation and unprecedented. sale. As it is, it is mildly inte-
resting, but “unconvincing.” The Bishop is apparently
conscious of being a bit of a bore, and so, in the midst
of a lengthy discourse, he diffidently requests to be allowed
“to say something further, if I do not weary you.” Whereupon
(Emilius Varro, a man of pleasure, and a lawyer, not to be out-
done in courtesy, replies, “Not at all. You astonish me too
much to weary me,” and thereby, as one never loses by polite:
ness, he lets himself in for a further continuation of the episcopal
dissertation. One of the best written scenes in the novel is the
description of Deacon Baudillas in the rat-pit. Should Mr.
WILson BARRETT elect to play the Deacon, what a sensation
his fight with the rats would cause if he were only sufficiently
terrier-fied! The last scene of the miraculous snow-storm is an
admirable climax, and would give opportunity for such scenic
effect as has not been seen on the stage since the volcanic days
of Claudian at the Princess's. THE BARON DE B.-W.

. The long and terrible list of bicycling accidents, which (at this
time of year) we publish daily, still continues to grow. The
latest batch is even more alarming than usual, and proves con-
clusively that no one with the smallest respect for their safety
should ever be induced to ride a bicycle. There are some per-
sons who seem unable to relish any amusement that is not fraught
with peril, but to such we would recommend bathing in the
whirlpools of Niagara as, on the whole, a less dangerous
recreation.
Fºom the highland village of Tittledrummie comes the news of
one terrible disaster. As JAMEs MACRANKY, a youth of fifteen,
was attempting to mount his machine for the first time in his
father's garden, the unfortunate lad lost his balance, and was pre-
cipitated into the middle of a gooseberry-bush, with the result
that his right hand was severely scratched. Although he is still
alive at present, it is highly probable that he will develop
symptoms of blood-poisoning in consequence of his misadventure
when tetanus will certainly supervene, and the fatal bicycle will
have brought one more victim to a premature death.
WHAT might have been a fatal accident was averted by the
merest chance in Kensington on Monday last. According to an
eye-witness of the thrilling scene, a young lady was riding by
herself (a dangerous practice which we have repeatedly censured)
along the Cromwell Road, when a hansom-cab suddenly appeared,
advancing rapidly in the opposite direction. With marvellous
nerve the young lady .." er machine to the left-hand side of
the road while §. cab was still fifty yards from her, and was thus
enabled to pass, it in safety. But supposing she had lost her
nerve in this alarming crisis, and had steered straight for the
horse's feet, she could only have escaped destruction by a miracle.
are loth to inflict too many - #. stories upon
our readers, so we will add only one more for
may well serve as a warning to those who tour in districts un-
known to them. A party of ladies and gentlemen made an
expedition on bicycles last week in the neighbourhood of Beach-
borough. Being unfamiliar with the locality, they dismounted at
a point where two cross-roads met, and hesitated as to which
direction they should take. By a providential chance, they de-
cided to keep to the left, and so reached their destination in
safety. Afterwards they learned with horror that had they
chosen the other road, ridden two miles along it, turned to the
†. and then to the left again, they would have found them-
selves close to the edge of the cliff, from which there is a sheer
drop of six hundred feet to the beach beneath! And there are
still some foolish persons who attempt to deny the awful perils
of cycling!
THE Daily Telegraph publishes a list of “Settling Days,” which
is probably very useful to natives and settlers. ut how about
a list of “Unsettling Days”? Prominent in the list would be
birthdays, wedding-days, quarter-days, Lord Mayor's days, civic
banquet days, Bank Éhi. of course, and many other days,
including nights, which have always been recognised as distinctly
“unsettling.”
The “Ex-M.P.” who wrote to the Times complaining that the
railway-rates for “bikes” were enormously high, evidently wished
to be “ex-m-p-ted.” But most certainly the freight-charges for
bicycling º: to be higher than for ordinary luggage. “Take
it up tenderly, treat it with care,” should be the rule, and bikers
wishing to travel by train should arrive early and give the porters
every chance.

DARBY JONES ON THE GESAREWITCH.
HoNouard SIR,--So regardless of past
favours is the Majority of Mankind, that
not only you, my ever esteemed Patron,
but also most of your readers, have pro-
bably forgotten that the limpecunious
Prophet of the Sport of Kings was enabled
this time last year to supply an augury
with regard to that noble Handicap, the
Cesarewitch, such as was calculated to
enable one and all to wash down the
appetising flesh of the Colchian bird with
copious draughts of the joyous vintage of
Champagne. I will not accuse you or
others, who profited by my advice then
and since, with Ingratitude. Rather will
I ascribe their remissness in the matter of
remittances to that Intoxication of Feel-
ing, which invariably follows the Glory of
Triumph.
Just ten years ago I knew a young Aris-
tocrat, who, broken on the Wheel of For-
tune, approached me with tears in his
deep blue eyes, and implored me, if pos-
sible, to give him that information which
was calculated to enable him to supply
himself with bread and cheese and bitter
beer, and his family with coals and
blankets, during the rigour of the ap-
proaching Winter. Touched by the misery
of his condition, I provided him there and
then with Humewood for the Cesarewitch,
and Gloriation, at forty golden shekels to
one, for the Cambridgeshire. Could
human divination have probed the mys-
teries of the Future to greater advantage P
My young Aristocrat was saved from star-
vation, and possibly a prolonged sojourn
in HER MAJESTY's Castle of Holloway!
“Was he grateful?” will naturally be
your query, when you consider the magni-
ficence of that superb Double Event.
Alas! I can truthfully state that the only
recompense which he vouchsafed to send
me took the shape of a brace of patriarchal
grouse, which had perhaps escaped from
the Ark. Last week, at Leicester, my
young Aristocrat did not even recognise
my features, as he elbowed his way past me
to the Paddock, clad in an irreproachable
Newmarket coat, and armed with a cigar
as long as a Torpedo Boat. I often think,
Sir, that BELISARIUs must have been no
general, but a prophet about chariot-
racing.
Similarly, when, last year, I distributed
St. Bºis with the freedom of a professional
gamester dealing cards, and ten to one
romped home at the hands of Kempton
CANNoN, but few of those honoraria that
grateful clients usually press upon their
professional advisers came into my pos-
session.
In all delicacy, I forbear, honoured Sir,
to continue this subject, because I have
since learnt from a Prodigious Penciller,
that some of the highest and mightiest
about the office of Mr. Punch were not
above following the recommendation of
the humble Vates. Verb. sap., as they
say in the classics. There is also an Eng-
lish adage, which runs, “It is never too
late to mend,” admirably illustrated in
romance and drama by the late Mr.
CHARLEs READE. You, Sir, could prove
its truth more privately, but quite as
effectively, the more so, as the same P. P.
informs me that the Winner of the Duke
of York Stakes was peacefully reposing up
your sleeve till such time as the race was
run.
And now to the business of the Bard.

“Of course, I KNow You Don't NEED on E, BUT IF You should HAPPEN To HEAR of
ANY ONE wanTING A well-BRED PUPPY, THINK of ME, Don't You KNow.”
Cesarewitch is this year run upon the
thirteenth day of the month, and on the
eve of the Natal Day of Sir WILLIAM
WERNoN HARcourt, and of the anniversary

. The long and terrible list of bicycling accidents, which (at this
time of year) we publish daily, still continues to grow. The
latest batch is even more alarming than usual, and proves con-
clusively that no one with the smallest respect for their safety
should ever be induced to ride a bicycle. ere are some per-
sons who seem unable to relish any amusement that is not fraught
with peril, but to such we would recommend bathing in the
whirlpools of Niagara as, on the whole, a less dangerous
recreation.
Fºom the highland village of Tittledrummie comes the news of
one terrible disaster. As JAMEs MACRANKY, a youth of fifteen,
was attempting to mount his machine for the first time in his
father's garden, the unfortunate lad lost his balance, and was pre-
cipitated into the middle of a gooseberry-bush, with the result
that his right hand was severely scratched. Although he is still
alive at present, it is highly probable that he will develop
symptoms of blood-poisoning in consequence of his misadventure
when tetanus will certainly supervene, and the fatal bicycle will
have brought one more victim to a premature death.
WHAT might have been a fatal accident was averted by the
merest chance in Kensington on Monday last. According to an
eye-witness of the thrilling scene, a young lady was riding by
herself (a dangerous practice whi h we have repeatedly censured)
along the Cromwell Road, when a hansom-cab suddenly appeared,
advancing ...} in the *. direction. With marvellous
nerve the young lady guided her machine to the left-hand side of
the road while the cab was still fifty yards from her, and was thus
enabled to pass, it in safety. But supposing she had lost her
nerve in this alarming crisis, and had steered straight for the
horse's feet, she could only have escaped destruction by a miracle.
may well serve as a warning to those who tour in districts un-
known to them. A party of ladies and gentlemen made an
expedition on bicycles last week in the neighbourhood of Beach-
borough. Being unfamiliar with the locality, they dismounted at
a point where two cross-roads met, and hesitated as to which
direction they should take. By a providential chance, they de-
cided to keep to the left, and so reached their destination in
safety. Afterwards they learned with horror that had they
chosen the other road, ridden two miles along it, turned to the
right, and then to the left again, they would have found them-
selves close to the edge of the cliff, from which there is a sheer
drop of six hundred feet to the beach beneath ! And there are
still some foolish persons who attempt to deny the awful perils
of cycling!
THE Daily Telegraph publishes a list of “Settling Days,” which
is probably very useful to natives and settlers. But how about
a list of “Unsettling Days”? Prominent in the list would be
birthdays, wedding-days, quarter-days, Lord Mayor's days, civic
banquet days, Bank Holidays, of course, and many other days,
including nights, which have always been recognised as distinctly
“unsettling.”
The “Ex-M.P.” who wrote to the Times complaining that the
railway-rates for “bikes” were cnormously high, evidently wished
to be “ex-m-p-ted.” But most certainly the freight-charges for
b.cycling ought to be higher than for ordinary luggage. “Take
it up tenderly, treat it with care,” should be the rule, and bikers
wishing to travel by train should arrive early and give the porters
every chance.

DARBY JONES ON THE GESAREWITCH.
HoNouard SIR,--So regardless of past
favours is the Majority of Mankind, that
not only you, my ever esteemed Patron,
but also most of your readers, have pro-
bably forgotten that the limpecunious
Prophet of the Sport of Kings was enabled
this time last year to supply an augury
with regard to that noble Handicap, the
Cesarewitch, such as was calculated to
enable one and all to wash down the
appetising flesh of the Colchian bird with
copious draughts of the joyous vintage of
Champagne. I will not accuse you or
others, who profited by my advice then
and since, with Ingratitude.
remittances to that Intoxication of Feel-
ing, which invariably follows the Glory of
Triumph.
Just ten years ago I knew a young Aris-
tocrat, who, broken on the Wheel of For-
tune, approached me with tears in his
deep blue eyes, and implored me, if
sible, to give him that information which
was calculated to enable him to supply
himself with bread and cheese and bitter
beer, and his family with coals and
blankets, during the rigour of the ap-
proaching Winter. Touched by the misery
of his condition, I provided him there and
then with Humewood for the Cesarewitch,
and Gloriation, at forty golden shekels to
one, for the Cambridgeshire. Could
human divination have probed the mys-
teries of the Future to greater advantage P
My young Aristocrat was saved from star-
vation, and possibly a prolonged sojourn
in HER MAJESTY's Castle of Holloway
“Was he grateful?” will naturally be
your query, when you consider the magni-
ficence of that superb Double Event.
Alas! I can truthfully state that the only
recompense which he vouchsafed to send
me took the shape of a brace of patriarchal
grouse, which had perhaps escaped from
the Ark. Last week, at Leicester, my
young Aristocrat did not even recognise
my features, as he elbowed his way past me
to the Paddock, clad in an irreproachable
Newmarket coat, and armed with a cigar
as long as a Torpedo Boat. I often think,
Sir, t BELISARIUs must have been no
general, but a prophet about chariot-
racing.
Similarly, when, last year, I distributed
St. Bri, with the freedom of a professional
gamester dealing cards, and ten to one
romped home at the hands of Kempton
CANNoN, but few of those honoraria that
grateful clients usually press upon their
professional advisers came into my pos-
Session.
In all delicacy, I forbear, honoured Sir,
to continue this subject, because I have
since learnt from a Prodigious Penciller,
that some of the highest and mightiest
about the office of Mr. Punch were not
above following the recommendation of
the humble Vates. Verb. sap., as they
say in the classics. There is also an Eng-
lish adage, which runs, “It is never too
late to mend,” admirably illustrated in
romance and drama by the late Mr.
CHARLEs READE. You, Sir, could prove
its truth more privately, but quite as
effectively, the more so, as the same P. P.
informs me that the Winner of the Duke
of York Stakes was peacefully reposing up
your sleeve till such time as the race was
run.

cided to keep to the left, and so reached their destination in
safety. Afterwards they learned with horror that had they
chosen the other road, ridden two miles along it, turned to the
: and then to the left again, they would have found them-
selves close to the edge of the cliff, from which there is a sheer
drop of six hundred feet to the beach beneath! And there are
still some foolish persons who attempt to deny the awful perils
of cycling!
THE Daily Telegraph publishes a list of “Settling Days,” which
is probably very useful to natives and settlers. ut how about
a list of “Unsettling Days”? Prominent in the list would be
birthdays, wedding-days, quarter-days, Lord Mayor's days, civic
banquet days, Bank §hi. of course, and many other days,
including nights, which have always been recognised as distinctly
“unsettling.”
The “Ex-M.P.” who wrote to the Times complaining that the
railway-rates for “bikes” were enormously high, evidently wished
to be “ex-m-p-ted.” But most certainly the freight-charges for
b.cycling º: to be higher than for ordinary luggage. “Take
it up tenderly, treat it with care,” should be the rule, and bikers
wishing to travel by train should arrive early and give the porters
every chance.

PUNCH, OR
DARBY JONES ON THE CESAREWITCH.
HoNouard SIR,--So regardless of past
favours is the Majority of Mankind, that
not only you, my ever esteemed Patron,
but also most of your readers, have pro-
bably forgotten that the Impecunious
Prophet of the Sport of Kings was enabled
this time last year to supply an augury
with regard to that noble Handicap, the
Cesarewitch, such as was calculated to
enable one and all to wash down the
appetising flesh of the Colchian bird with
copious draughts of the joyous vintage of
Champagne. I will not accuse, you or
others, who profited by my advice then
and since, with Ingratitude.
remittances to that Intoxication of Feel-
ing, which invariably follows the Glory of
Triumph.
Just ten years ago I knew a young Aris-
tocrat, who, broken on the Wheel of For-
tune, approached me with tears in his
deep blue eyes, and implored me, if pos-
sible, to give him that information which
was calculated to enable him to supply
himself with bread and cheese and bitter
beer, and his family , with coals and
blankets, during the rigour of the ap-
proaching Winter. Touched by the misery
of his condition, I provided him there and
then with Humewood for the Cesarewitch,
and Gloriation, at forty golden shekels to
one, for the Cambridgeshire. Could
human divination have probed the mys-
teries of the Future to greater advantage P
My young Aristocrat was saved from star-
vation, and possibly a prolonged sojourn
in HER MAJESTY's Castle of Holloway !
“Was he grateful?” will naturally be
your query, when you consider the magni-
ficence of that superb Double Event.
Alas! I can truthfully state that the only
recompense which he vouchsafed to send
me took the shape of a brace of patriarchal
grouse, which had perhaps escaped from
the Ark. Last week, at Leicester, my
young Aristocrat did not even recognise
my features, as he elbowed his way past me
to the Paddock, clad in an irreproachable
Newmarket coat, and armed with a cigar
as long as a Torpedo Boat. I often think,
Sir, that BELISARIUs must have been no
general, but a prophet about chariot-
racing.
Similarly, when, last year, I distributed
St. His with the freedom of a professional
gamester dealing cards, and ten to one
romped home at the hands of Kempton
CANNoN, but few of those honoraria that
grateful clients usually press upon their
professional advisers came into my pos-
session.
In all delicacy, I forbear, honoured, Sir,
to continue this subject, because I have
since learnt from a Prodigious Penciller,
that some of the highest and mightiest
about the office of Mr. Punch were not
above following the recommendation of
the humble Vates. Verb. sap., as they
say in the classics. There is also an Eng-
lish adage, which runs, “It is never too
late to mend,” admirably illustrated in
romance and drama by the late Mr.
CHARLEs READE. You, Sir, could prove
its truth more privately, but quite as
effectively, the more so, as the same P. P.
informs me that the Winner of the Duke
of York Stakes was peacefully reposing up
your sleeve till such time as the race was
run.
And now to the business of the Bard.

“Of course, I know You Don't NEED on E, BUT IF You should HAPPEN TO HEAR of
ANY on E wanTING A well-BRED PUPPY, think of ME, Don't You KNow.”
Cesarewitch is this year run upon the
thirteenth day of the month, and on the
eve of the Natal Day of Sir WILLIAM
WERNoN HARcourt, and of the anniversary
of the Battle of Hastings. I am not one
to believe that these dispiriting influences
will interfere with the success of the
Handicap, so I boldly plunge, like an
experienced diver, into the troubled waters
of Prejudgment, and herewith sing—
I have no fear of Asteroid,
No Jacobean for me,
One Saint, I fear, is null and void,
But the Second looks well to be.
The Judicious Lover may run right well,
And the Man of the Sun go free,
And the Rush on the Grange may the Market swell,
But I’ll stand by the Son of the Sea,
With, given a start for Jack of the Mart,
To finish in one, two, three.
There! the weary brain is at rest for a
brief period, the goose-quill drops from the
digits of the Poet, and once more the
Promethean fire flickers as it dies from the
brow of
Your devoted henchman and heeler,

NATURAL HISTORY..—THE HORSE.
THE noblest conquest which the horse
has ever made is that of man, that spirited
and haughty animal which shares with him
the fatigues of war and the glory of the
combat. Consider how man, from the
cradle to the grave, is absorbed in devotion
to the equine race. When mewling and
puking in his nurse's arms, he agitates his
own little limbs, and appeal; frantically to
the passing “gee-gee.” As he grows
older, he becomes further and further in-
volved in some form of horse worship.
The most deified type of horse is the Race-
horse. Each one of these glorified beings
has its attendant suite of men and boys to
perform the sacred rites. “Jokkies” and
“Grewms” represent respectively a higher
and lower order of priesthood, with aco-
lytes known as “Stabel-bhoys.” Immense
are the sacrifices that have been made in
this system of worship. There also exists
a missionary order known as “Bookkiz.”
They speak an occult language, which is
closely studied by a large and earnest-
minded section of humankind. A talis-
manic virtue is attributed to certain for-
mulae, such as “Tentowuninarphkrowns.”
The Great Successful Chief of all the
Bookkiz is “Ibak the Winnar.”
All this is interesting as showing that
the horse is an animal that age cannot

“DIET UNLIMITED ''
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-As a general thing,
I don't read the papers much — except
yours, of course—because they’re full of
politics and all that kind of thing, so that,
bar the cricket and footer news, they are
precious uninteresting. But lately I no-
ticed that one of them, by some fluke, had
a lot of letters on a really important sub-
ject; they were headed, “The Feeding at
the Public Schools.” Some of them were
most awful rot, and I wrote to the editor,
and told him he must be a silly juggins to
print such drivel; but he hasn’t published
my letter yet. One chap wrote to say that
schoolboys were “pampered with luxuries
in these days.” Just let him come and try
the Sunday stodge here. But, to make up,
there were one or two letters that were
first-class, and I cut one out and left it
on old BAGs' desk, so I hope he may read
it. It says that it is scandalous that boys
should be driven to buy for themselves
the food with which their housemasters
should supply them. This is quite true,
and BAGs ought to supply me with all
the Turkish Delight I want. Then the
letter goes on : “It is unreasonable to
expect growing boys to use and develop
their brain-power satisfactorily unless they
are ºft.*. generous and liberal diet.”
Mr. Punch, that man is really sensible, and
I jolly well wish he was my tutor instead
of BAGs. “A generous and liberal diet!”
Sardines, and marmalade, and ices, and
cocoa, and potted meat, and bananas, and
sausage-rolls—why am f not given these ?
And when I buy them with my hard-
earned pocket-money, they don’t under-
stand that I only wish to develop my brain-
power. Only yesterday one of the masters
called me a “greedy little pig,” because he
found me eating butter-scotch. Had my
tongue not been engaged at that moment,
I would have explained that butter-scotch
runs you up more brain-power than any-
thing else, and that I was only eating it in
| order to do well in school, and be a credit
to my dear parents. It is true that I came
out bottom of my form last term. Why
was that P BAGs—who is a beast—said it
was “incurable idleness.” I know now
that it was nothing of the kind; it was
simply because I had no chocolate creams
for a fortnight before the end of the term,
and my brain-powerfor the exams. suffered
in consequence. You can't call a diet
“generous and liberal ” if it has no choco-
late creams in it.
And now I'll give you my own opinion
about this most important question. The
beginning of the term is all right, fellows
bring back grub with them, and they’ve
got money as well to buy more. But it's
quite different later on, when everyone's
more or less stony-broke. In fact, though
we’ve only been back three weeks, I fear
that my brain-power won't develop satis-
factorily much longer; I finished the last
pot of strawberry jam last night. I am
sure that you will agree that it would be
a great pity if I didn't get my remove at
the end of this term, and my only chance
is a generous and liberal diet. This is, in
fact, why I am writing to you. I’m sure
that you or some of your readers would like
to help me, and all they have to do is to
send me a fair-sized hamper once a week
or so. My brain-power specially needs
potted shrimps, rkish Delight, and
dessert biscuits. Or, if you like to send
me the cash, I’ll buy the things myself.
Yours affectionately,

[“During his recent visit to the Emperor of Austria, WILLIAM THE Second is said to have revealed himself in quite a new light. After the State
Banquet, when the two Sovereigns and a few favoured guests retired to enjoy a quiet cigar, His Majesty produced a couple of packs of cards, and amused
the company with conjuring tricks.”—Daily Paper.]
THE FIELD OF THE GLOTH OF GREEN.
IN history, which records the lives
Of Kings (and others), we are told
How HENRY-he that had the wives—
Met FRANCIS on a Field of Gold ;
There must have been a reason why they
met,
But that, and all the details, I forget.
Though distances were then the same
Both here and out in foreign parts,
The times were still a little lame
In point of locomotive arts;
And monarchs seldom trysted, as to-day,
Unless they had a lot of things to say.
But now the task of touring round
Is expedited by the rail,
And fresh facilities abound
For transport on a cheapened scale;
Then, too, relationships are much improved,
Since all are cousins-german—or removed.
And so together, King and King,
They picnic nearly every week;
They shoot the chamois on the wing,
And buss each other on the cheek;
And this, as “Honest John ” would have
us see,
All makes for peace and beauteous har-
mony.
Pretty it was to mark the play
Of Rulers reeking from the chase,
When GERMANY the other day
The rendezvous (unlike the Field aſ
Guisnes)
Was here upholstered with a Cloth of
Green.
Dinner was over; host and guest
Were full enough of meat and drink;
Each had rehearsed the very best
Old platitudes without a wink;
They then adjourned (see authorized
report)
With kindred spirits of the choicer sort.
Here followed something which, for me,
I find it simple to believe;
For at this juncture GERMANY
Produced a parcel from his sleeve,
And looking round with affable regards
Undid a duplicated pack of cards.
He dealt them with the airy flick
That lighter-fingered folk affect;
Not any flaw in any trick
Could anybody there detect ;
Which * that WILLIAM managed better
than
AH SIN himself, and he a Chinamanl
Dispensing with external aids
e bade the chosen card appear,
And once he palmed the deuce of spades
Behind the lobe of AUSTRIA's ear;
And once with brilliant gestures drew the
pack
From somewhere down a Ducal Person's
Unblushing he would force a card,
Or hold it up his hollowed hand,
For he had practised long and hard
To keep his plastic features bland;
But all his crowning skill he seemed to
Save
For that
the
Three cards suffice: a deal is done,
Each being laid upon its face;
The betting odds are two to one
You miss the card you want to trace;
This trick is very trying to the brain,
As I have noticed in a railway-train.

The Knave, disguised in Prussian blue,
For partners ad a pair of Kings;
And WILLIAM, doing Ali he knew,
So dexterously worked the things,
That all the company was sore perplexed
To gather where the Knave was going
next.
The claims of space forbid me to
Enlarge upon his other tricks,
Symbols, I take it, of a new
And fearful phase in politics;
They tell me he aspires to be the crack
Shuffler of all the European pack.
I dare believe it. Some may hope
The KAISER's bolt will soon be shot;
They limit his prodigious scope;
I must confess that I do not;
Close study of his nature proves there is

No end to WILLIAM's possibilities.

to be identified only with Miss Louie

mortalised by DICKENs in The Old Curio-
sity Shop, is so remarkable as to convert a
very ordinary “farcical comedy” into an
extra-ordinary attraction. Oddly enough,
the part of the soft-hearted, self-sacrificing,
cockney lodging-house maid-of-all-work is,
apparently, not essential to the meagre
story, strung together by three authors
Messrs. MARK AMBIENT, ATwood, an
WAUN, which could be worked out by all
the other characters without Aurora's as-
sistance; and it is not in depreciation of
Mr. CHARLEs GLENNEY's energetic efforts
as the young doctor, nor of the ever-amus-
ing eccentricities of Mr. ALFRED MALTBY
as a kind of Pecksniffian father (admirably
made up), to say, that work as hard as
they may, the piece would not be worth
consideration but for Miss Louie FREEAR
as Aurora.
Strange that this “Farcical Comedy” is
for the poor servant-girl a very tragedy;
, for laugh, as all must, at her slatternly
appearance, and at the slipshod vulgarity
of her manners, yet it is impossible not to
be touched by her kindliness of heart, by
“All for 'im 1'.'
her devotion to her ideal love, and by the
cruel disillusioning revelation which, at the
supreme moment when she is decked out
in all her poor finery, fully expecting to
SONGS AND THEIR
SINGERS. No. XVI.
“'Tis HARD TO GIVE THE HAND WHERE THE HEART CAN NEVER BE "
from her broken heart the despairing cry,
“Then I'm a widow,” as she falls fainting
on the floor, and the curtain rapidly de-
scends. This is tragedy, and if we were
not constrained to laugh, by reason of the
absurdity of the object of our compassion,
we should cry. As it is, “She’s a poor
pauper, whom nobody owns,” and for whom
not one of the principal characters in the
story evinces the slightest regard.
A very little strengthening of the con-
ventional part of the Doctor's Page,
played by Miss CLARA JECKs, might have
turned this character into a sort of Sam
Huacter, whose good-natured efforts at
consolation, after Pen's desertion, light-
ened up the pale and grief-stricken coun-
tenance of hapless little Fanny, and whom
she ultimately married.
Unlimited Louie FREEAR saves and
makes the piece; and, as this is of course
what the combined authors intended, they
must be congratulated on their sagacity.
There is a brilliant season in prospect for
the Royalty as long as this bright particu-
lar star Aurora is shining.

ABROAD IN THE AUTUMN.
Munich,--Imagine the patience of over 350,000 people who say
willingly, frequently, and at full length, two such appalling words
as Glyptothek and Pinakothek! Is it the stolid indifference of the
Teutonic race, or the good-natured patience of the Bavarians,
which has made them refrain from any abbreviation? Impossible
to say—like the words at first. Even Germans from neighbour-
ing cities, accustomed to such fearful sounds and to unending
syllables as well as to adjectival phrases of staggering length,
which the newly in Germany arrived stranger puzzle, struggle
with them in anguish. Englishmen, pronouncing the barbarous
names in the Anglo-Greek manner, are equally astray. Unaided
by a knowledge of the derivation a stranger might imagine that
two places with such names were, at the best, a lunatic asylum
and a mortuary. Compare, in the French language, la Morgue,
which sounds positively pretty. Only an extremely solider Herr,
a placid drinker of endless tankards of Munich beer, would use
such names. They are all very solid gentlemen here, and so
contented with the second name that they use it twice, for the
Alte and the Neue.
The Pinakotheks, Old and New, are galleries of painting,
While Greek and Roman statues fill the harmless Glyptothek.
Nothing worse. No fear of delicately-nurtured women fainting,
Nor will courageous men, aghast, to flight on tiptoe take.
They are certainly patient people here. They have carts—
especially brewers' drays—so enormously long, that the length of
them is greater than the width of the average roadway. When
one of them crosses a street, all the traffic is stopped; when it
has to turn a corner the horses are in the shop windows on one
side and the back of the cart sweeps all the foot-passengers off
the pavement on the opposite side. But no one complains. In
England the windlass is a simple appliance for hoisting materials
in a new building. It seems unknown here. A horse is attached
to the rope, and is led along the street. As the iron girder, or
whatever it may be, reaches the fourth or fifth story, yards and
yards of rope stretch along the roadway behind the horse. The
traffic is stopped, the foot-passengers and the brewers’ drays,
now companions in misfortune, are together swept aside, but no
one complains. Here all the hard work of the bricklayers' assist-
ants is done by women. They look very sturdy. They do not
complain. But the grandest instance of patience is the game of
Bier. In England we sit and play at whist or chess, some even
at backgammon or poker; in France dominoes wile away the
idle hours, but in Bavaria the grandest game is Bier. It is a
simple game. You sit and smoke, and drink till you can drink no
more. It has not the science of chess, or the animation of poker,
but it is the favourite pastime of the country for all that. Else-
where, drinking is ridiculously associated with thirst. Here the
two are absolutely distinct. A foreigner cannot hope to see the
end of the game. He leaves off when the native has hardly be-
gun, or for him it would be Bier, in German, at the beginning,
and bier, in English, at the end.
I observe in several shops a series of books for learning lan-
guages without a teacher. They include “Englisch’” and “Ameri-
kanisch,” two separate tongues. Unhappily, omit to buy one of
the latter, and so lose the chance of learning the language.
Shall always regret this. Would be so useful when travelling.
I go over the Royal Palace. It can only be visited at eleven,
daily, and everyone must go then. There are perhaps fifty of
us, mostly patient Germans. There is one American family. I
always pity the American children, eight, or seven, or six years
old, dragged over “Yewrope.” In this case the smallest child
cannot be more than five, and he is such an extremely small boy
that he is lost among the boots of the crowd before we start.
only I had bought those dialogues in Amerikanisch I might have
urged his “Poppa" to leave the infant at the hotel. owever,
he is discovered, and we are conducted round. We see a vast
number of rooms, mostly ugly, and the farther we go the smaller
they become. The American baby is lost and found regularly.
His cap has vanished, his hair is brushed over his face, his little
jacket is nearly pulled off him, but he is a brave child. He does
not cry, he does not complain, he does not even speak. In his
tiny breast there glows the silent, Spartan spirit of the American
tourist. He will do the place thoroughly. He sees nothing but
the boots of the Germans, but he goes on indomitably. However
small the room all the party naturally wish to see it, as they have
paid for admission to the Palace. At last we reach a room, a
cabinet, so tiny that it seems to have been designed for the
American infant. He would fill it comfortably. few of the
fifty squeeze in, he with them, and the rest look sullenly at their
backs from outside. And still that marvellous child comes out
alive! He is not even injured, for later on I see him hurried
round the Alte Pinakothek, from PERUGINo to RUBENs, from
MURILLo to DURER, untired, undaunted.

invariably omitted, as every county can already show any number

DARBY JONES NATURALLY ELATED.
HoNourED SIR,-Once more has the old
Warrior prophesied the solution of the
Cesarewitch Conundrum, and placed you
and your readers in the proud position for
adding substantial luxuries to wonted
Winter provender. Were I an advertising
tipster, I would insert the following in
every leading journal, including the
London Gazette:—
Who gave Merman at fourteen to one?

Who plumped for Merman f
Jones.
Who has enriched landsmen with a
Merman f DARBY Jones.

Who at the present moment is expecting
the reward of Merman's success? DARBy
Jones.
But, as you know well, honoured Sir, the
obviously laudatory paragraphs in question
are merely the playful lucubrations of an
Observant and Triumphant Brain. Armed
with a well-lined note-case, and still con-
tinuing to drink the health of the Jersey
Lily, I feel in but poor fettle to stain my
fingers with blue-black ink were it not for

so long beforehand, to draw the attention
of my clients to the Prodigious Chance
possessed by the other Jersey Crack for

riding, appears to be picking the horse's

A tip in time saves many mischances,
though later on I shall revert to the sub-
ject in poetic vein. Meantime here is

onoured Sir, to ascertain that you and
your distinguished associates were not too
exalted to accept the ipse dirit of the
Garrulous Old Man, and in this connection
I may mention that my Wine Cellar and
Cigar Cabinet sadly need replenishing.
You know, Sir, the adage about a win
and a nod. I will say no more. I was in
rare luck by the Ditch, for I met an Im-
poverished Nobleman, who, having owed
me five golden sovereigns for five ſº
years, was sufficiently alive to the respon-
sibilities of the situation as to hand me
five shillings of the amount due, with a
verbal I O U for the balance. And then
he put a frigid hundred (on the nod) on
Carlton Grange for the big race. ere

although possessing the vocal strength of
Mr. RICHARD | DUNN, are nevertheless,
under certain circumstances, as beautifully

JONES, WYNDHAM. & CO. LIMITED LIAR-ABILITY.
Everybody interested in the Drama will heartily congratulate
Mr. HENRY ARTHUR Jones, first on having written the best
comedy that has been seen for some time on the English stage,
and, secondly, on his exceptionally good fortune in procuring
for it so excellent a company as Mr. CHARLEs WYNDHAM
gathered round him at the Criterion Theatre. It is not too much
to say that there is not, in the whole cast, one single rôle even
indifferently played. Ail concerned, from the principal charac-
ter down to a supernumerary servant, are at their very best.
So also is the author. The third act is perfect comedy; the wit
lies in the situation developed by dialogue that is never once
strained for effect, and by perfectly natural acting, that is,
by acting of the highest artistic merit. From the commence.
ment of this act until within measurable distance of its climax
the audience laugh heartily; the enjoyment of the ingeni-
ous complication being intensified with the arrival of each
character on the scene. The actors are perfectly serious; the
audience, being in the secret, revel in their perplexities and in
the prospective tragedy of their troubles. º third act is a
masterpiece, and indeed it would be difficult to name any other
comedy of our time in which there occurs a better scene, or even
its equal.
An author creates his characters, and has an unquestionable
right to do as he likes with them within the elastic limits of pro-
#. It may be doubted whether in the fourth act, which is
at a great disadvantage after so brilliant a third, the author has
not, in a weak and tender-hearted moment, allowed himself to
yield to the pleadings of Miss MARY MooRE on behalf of Lady
Jessica Nepean, and caused that irritating, flirty, flighty little
person, the liar-in-chief, to make just one attempt at winning
the sympathy of the audience. This is most i. a mistake;
she should be a feather-headed, vain, silly flirt to the last; there
should have been no secret parting with her devoted lover, leavin
meeting; and if the husband (admirably played by Mr. STANDING)
is compelled by the author to propose an enjoyable supper-
party,...we ought to see at a glance how, in another second
will all smiles and enthusiasm over a delicious pâté and
inspiring champagne. And in this fourth act, too, Mr. CHARLEs
WYNDHAM, making his preparations for going to Africa next
morning, is perpetually breaking off in the midst of his serious
speeches, suddenly remembering that “he must go on with his
; 'just as in The Headless Man he was always interrupting
himself with “Now I must write to my uncle.” Presumably there
is, in this act, more of CHARLEs WYNDHAM, as Christopher
Deering, than of HENRY AUTHoR Jones. Also the love-maki
of Sir Christopher, and his final acceptance by the widow, Mrs.
Crespin (Miss JANETTE STEER), seems to have been an after-
thought for the sake of “keeping up the Christopher.”
That the celebrated African explorer, the terribly-in-
earnest Edward Falkner (Mr. THALBERG)—L'homme qui ne rit
s—should have allowed even his best friend to continue bully-
ing and lecturing him, “all for his good,” as if he were a naught
school-boy, is, granted the character as described and pourtrayed,
a step beyond the bounds of probability. Such a man might
just tolerate a moral lecture from his dearest friend once, and
only once; but he would then have said, “My dear fellow, many
thanks. You mean well; but—I don't wish to hear any more on
this subject, and so good day.” Any further interference would
have been resented as an impertinence by such a man of action
as is this resolute African explorer.
Mr. WANE-TEMPEST and Mr. ALFRED Bishop are admirable; as
are all the ladies in the play without exception. -
That the Criterion is provided with an exceptional play which
will have an º: long run, there cannot be a doubt;
so, once again,_congratulations to all concerned in it.

“Dainty” is the word for it. . Nothing short of the epithet
“dainty” can be applied to the little pocket-volume containing The
Itape of the Lock, illustrated in weirdly-fantastic style by Mr.
AURREY BEARDSLEY. . Yet the fantastic has great attractions.
It invites close inquiry into details by the aid of a powerful
magnifying-glass, otherwise may be lost some of the exquisite
limning which is the specialité of this artist. Yet, Belinda at her
toilet-table, having her hair dressed by her maid, while the park
in perspective is seen through the open window; is the best, as it
is the simplest of them all. Of the “strange phantoms rising as
the mists arise" (p. 32), it can only be said that it is a marvellous
representation of the nightmare of an artist who does himself not
wisely, but far too well, at an unnecessary supper. “Only that
and nothing more.” The book is a dainty curiosity, and there is
not a collector of such literary curios who should be without this
latest edition of Pope's “Heroi-comical poem,” The Rape of the
Lock, as published by LEONARD SMITHERs of the Royal Arcade, W.
By Right of Sword (HUTCHINson) is a book my Baronite recom.
mends the gentle reader not to pick up about the hour at which
she (or º ought to be going to bed. It will be found difficult
to lay it down before reading it through. The plot is most in-
genious, a quite original development of the Jekyll and Hyde
idea. e wide difference is, }. there are actually two men
concerned, the merging of their identity being rendered possible
by singularly complete personal resemblance. The Cornish man
having assumed the name and position of the Russian officer who
meanwhile has fled the country, works his way through the laby-
rinth of danger and difficulty under the guidance of Mr. MARch-
Mont's skilful hand. From the safety of a comfortable chair the
reader follows with breathless interest the frequent feints and
swift turns.
Mr. MoRLEY Roberts knows his Thames from Chelsea to
Rotherhithe, and has the gift of peopling it with pictures of men
and things, not forgetting women. In Maurice Quain (HUTCHIN-
son), the half-of London who have not the slightest idea how the
other half live, will find the secret disclosed. The life is sordid,
not always honest, occasionally brutal. Mr. Roberts has suc-
ceeded in investing it with a garment of romance that makes it
grimly attractive. Above all, there is the river in its varied
moods and aspects, at morning, noon, and night, painted with
skill and force my Baronite does not remember to be exceeded

A. Yes; the silly fellow has authorised an increment of 8,000

Q W.i. out with it—why not?
A. Because only a fool doesn't know that during the last
quarter of a century we have increased our territory by millions
of miles.
Q. Then what on earth are we to do?
A. Why, stir up John BULL with a long É. and give him no
peace until he is wide awake to his responsibilities.
Q. And how is this to be done—by hanging somebody?
A. Well, that would be the best way, but as that sort of thing
is out of date, and also illegal, perhaps it is safer to attain the
same effect by a rattling good alarmist speech delivered at a
widely-reported public dinner.

BREED THAT 'AVEN'T GOT ANY SMELL 1"
JONES, WYNDHAM. & CO. LIMITED LIAR-ABILITY.
EveRxbody interested in the Drama will heartily congratulate
Mr. HENRY ARTHUR Jones, first on having written the best
comedy that has been seen for some time on the English stage,
and, secondly, on his exceptionally good fortune in procuring
for it so excellent a company as Mr. CHARLEs WYNDHAM
gathered round him at the Criterion Theatre. It is not too much
to say that there is not, in the whole cast, one single rôle even
indifferently played. Ail concerned, from the principal charac-
ter down to a supernumerary servant, are at their very best.
So also is the author. The third act is perfect comedy; the wit
lies in the situation developed by dialogue that is never once
strained for effect, and by perfectly natural acting, that is,
by acting of the highest artistic merit. From the commence-
ment of this act until within measurable distance of its climax
the audience laugh heartily; the enjoyment of the ingeni-
ous complication being intensified with the arrival of each
character on the scene. The actors are perfectly serious; the
audience, being in the secret, revel in their perplexities and in
the prospective tragedy of their troubles. º third act is a
masterpiece, and indeed it would be difficult to name any other
comedy of our time in which there occurs a better scene, or even
its equal.
An author creates his characters, and has an unquestionable
right to do as he likes with them within the elastic limits of pro-
bability. It may be doubted whether in the fourth act, which is
at a great disadvantage after so brilliant a third, the author has
not, in a weak and tender-hearted moment, allowed himself to
yield to the pleadings of Miss MARY MooRk on behalf of Lady
Jessica Nepean, and caused that irritating, flirty, flighty little
person, the liar-in-chief, to make just one attempt at winning
the sympathy of the audience. This is most decidedly a mistake;
she should be a feather-headed, vain, silly flirt to the last; there
has morning, is
meeting; and if the husband (admirably played by Mr. STANDING)
is compelled by the author to propose an enjoyable supper-
party,...we ought to see at a glance how, in another second
she will be all smiles and enthusiasm over a delicious pâté and
inspiring champagne. And in this fourth act, too, Mr. CHARLEs
WYNPHAM, making his preparations for going to Africa next
rpetually breaking off in the midst of his serious
speeches, suddenly remembering that “he must go on with his
packing,”just as in The Headless Man he was always interrupting
himself with “Now I must write to my uncle.” Presumably there
is, in this act, more of CHARLEs WYNDHAM, as Christopher
Deering, than of HENRY AUTHoR Jones. Also the love-maki
of Sir Christopher, and his final acceptance by the widow, Mrs.
Crespin (Miss JANETTE STEER), seems to have been an after-
thought for the sake of “keeping up the Christopher.”
That the celebrated African explorer, the terribly-in-
earnest Edward Falkner (Mr. THALBERG)—L'homme qui ne rit
s—should have allowed even his best friend to continue bully-
ing and lecturing him, “all for his good,” as if he were a naught
school-boy, is, granted the character as described and º
a step beyond the bounds of probability. Such a man might
just tolerate a moral lecture from his dearest friend once, and
only once; but he would then have said, “My dear fellow, many
thanks. You mean well; but—I don't wish to hear any more on
this subject, and so good day.” Any further interference would
have been resented as an impertinence by such a man of action
as is this resolute African explorer.
Mr. WANE-TEMPEST and Mr. ALFRED Bishop are admirable; as
are all the ladies in the play without exception.
That the Criterion is provided with an exceptional play which
will have an jº long run, there cannot be a doubt;
so, once again,_congratulations to all concerned in it.


should have been no secret parting with her devoted lover, leavin
the audience in doubt as to what really took place at that º:

“Dainty” is the word for it. Nothing short of the epithet
“dainty” can be applied to the little pocket-volume containing The
Itape of the Lock, illustrated in weirdly-fantastic style by Mr.
AUBREY BEARDSLEY. . Yet the fantastic has great, attractions.
It invites close inquiry into details by the aid of a powerful
magnifying-glass, otherwise may be lost some of the exquisite
limning which is the specialité of this artist. Yet, Belinda at her
toilet-table, having her hair dressed by her maid, while the park
in perspective is seen through the open window; is the best, as it
is the simplest of them all. Of the “strange phantoms rising as
the mists arise" (p. 32), it can only be said that it is a marvellous
representation of the nightmare of an artist who does himself not
wisely, but far too well, at an unnecessary supper. “Only that
and nothing more.” The book is a dainty curiosity, and there is
not a collector of such literary curios who should be without this
latest edition of Pope's “Heroi-comical poem,” The Rape of the
Lock, as published by LEONARD SMITHERs of the Royal Arcade, W.
By #! of Sword (HUTCHINson) is a book my Baronite recom.
mends the gentle reader not to pick up about the hour at which
she (or º ought to be going to bed. It will be found difficult
to lay it down before reading it through. The plot is most in-
genious, a quite original development of the Jekyll and Hyde
idea. The wide difference is, }. there are actually two men
concerned, the merging of their identity being rendered possible
by singularly complete personal resemblance. The Cornish man
having assumed the name and position of the Russian officer who
meanwhile has fled the country, works his way through the laby-
rinth of danger and difficulty under the guidance of Mr. MARCH-
Mont's skilful hand. From the safety of a comfortable chair the
reader follows with breathless interest the frequent feints and
swift turns.
Mr. MoRLEY Roberts knows his Thames from Chelsea to
Rotherhithe, and has the gift of peopling it with pictures of men
and things, not forgetting women. In Maurice Quain (HUTCHIN-
son), the half-of London who have not the slightest idea how the
other half live, will find the secret disclosed. The life is sordid,
not always honest, occasionally brutal. Mr. Roberts has suc-
ceeded in investing it with a garment of romance that makes it
grimly attractive. Above all, there is the river in its varied
moods and aspects, at morning, noon, and night, painted with
skill and force my Baronite does not remember to be exceeded
in other pages. THE BARoN DE B.-W.

Answer. That is the ridiculous fact—until this year.
Q. And the dolt has done something at last?
A. Yes; the silly fellow has authorised an increment of 8,000
Inen.
Q. Good gracious ! Is this enough P
A. By Jingo! No.
Q. Well, out with it—why not?
A. Because only a fool doesn't know that during the last
quarter of a century we have increased our territory by millions
of miles.
Q. Then what on earth are we to do?
A. Why, stir up John Bull with a long É. and give him no
peace until he is wide awake to his responsibilities.
Q. And how is this to be done—by hanging somebody?
A. Well, that would be the best way, but as that sort of thing
is out of date, and also illegal, perhaps it is safer to attain the
same effect by a rattling good alarmist speech delivered at a
widely-reported public dinner.

A JEWEL OF AN IDEA.
[“A machine for making matrimonial proposals is the latest novelty. This
interesting development is to be seen in a West End jeweller's window, and
at first sight appears to be an innocent marguerite daisy in white enamel upon
§. but, by moving an adroitly hidden spring in the calyx, the single
lossom expands into a double one; and upon the newly-revealed petals is
written the all-momentous question.”—Daily Tº
WE understand that a well-known Peer is shortly to figure as
defendant in no fewer than six breach-of-promise actions. It seems
that, admiring a new variety of brooch exhibited in a jeweller's
window, he purchased half-a-dozen, and gave them to various
ladies of his acquaintance. He was wholly unaware that, on
pressing a spring, there appeared inscribed on each brooch the
words “Will you marry lº Each of the recipients, however,
speedily discovered the inscription, and each wrote an affection-
ate and an affirmative answer to the question, whence the un-
pleasant position in which his lordship now finds himself.
THERE is no truth in the report that Lord BATTLEAxE has con-
sented to his son's proposed marriage. On the contrary, we
understand that when, in accordance with the prevailing fashion,
the young gentleman presented his father with a scarf-pin bear:
ing the words “Nothing will induce me to give her up!”. Lord
BATTLEAxe replied by giving his son, a delicately-engraved ring,
inscribed simply, “Cut off with a shilling.”
IN selecting jewellery conveying messages, it is well to be
particular that each article is sent to the person for whom it is
intended. We heard lately of a young man who chose two
lockets as presents, one meant for an elderly relative, containing
the other, intended for his fiancée, reading, “Darling, my love,
my sweet, my heart's delight !” By a stupid blunder on the
part of the shopkeeper, his aged maiden aunt received the latter,
and the young lady who was but is no longer—his fiancée, the
::::::: of these lockets, with, in each case, the most disastrous
results.
THE daughter of an American millionaire is said to have ordered
a gross of dainty gold charms, each being an exquisite model of
a boot. These are intended to convey her answer to the numer-
ous suitors who present her with a “proposal brooch.” Unlike
those articles, however, they contain no hidden inscription; Miss
DollarFUL considers that the delicate symbolism conveyed by
her act of giving her would-be wooers the boot will be a suffi-
ciently explicit answer to their proposals.
WE understand that Mr. Robinson, the eminent novelist, is
utilising this new and admirable method of making proposals in
his forthcoming story. There is a grand scene, we believe, when
the hero and heroine, who are both too bashful to speak to each
other, find themselves alone in a garden together. The hero
attempts to offer his beloved a proposal jewel, but the bashful
maiden is loth to receive it, and it is only when he has chased hel
round the garden for half an hour that he contrives at length
to º it down her back. It would be unfair to the author to
reveal the subsequent events of his story, but we may hint that
many exciting episodes follow. The heroine orders at her
jewellers a stud for the hero, inscribed, “Darling, I am yours!”
ut the villain, whom she has preyiously rejected with scorn,
bribes the jeweller to alter the words to “Brute, I detest you!”

the words, “Old age like thine is more than youth or beauty,”
and the most thrilling complications ensue.

4 Betrothed Individual of the Weaker Ser is sur-

A LITTLE line of love you send
Across the “herring-pond" to me,
Who was and is and will be friend
So long as friend I yet may be ;
So long as in the far, far West,
You don't forget your plighted troth,
And do remember that the best
Of all this life is near for both.
There was a time, I think, my own,
When separation seemed an ill
Scarce to be borne by one alone,—
Who had Love's message to fulfil.
And yet you crossed that wretched sea,
On Californian coast to roam,
Impelled, you said, while you were free,
o look upon Great Freedom's Home!
You write with something of reproof
About Miss ANGELINA BRowN.—
From her I’ve strictly held aloof
Since you, my love, went out of town.
A pelican could not be more
n desert sand regenerate,
And yet your tone is very sore
When writing from the Golden Gate.
A cablegram | The horrid thing
Has sent a quirer through my brain
That hardened knock! That brazen ring!
Are prophets of a coming pain!
“Married to-day” the message reads,
Not naming the presumptuous clown.
From you my heart (don't think it bleeds)
THE BLEGER BLKED.
HENPECK'D he was. He learnt to bike.
“Now I can go just where I like,”
He chuckled to himself. But she
Had learnt to bike as well as he,
And, what was more, had bought a new
Machine to sweetly carry two.
Ever together now they go,
He sighing, “This is wheel and woe.”

THE BOOM IN OOM.
I.—“Look HERE UPON THIS PICTURE."
HE is not fair to vulgar eyes
As many monarchs be;
My hero's merit rather lies
In rare simplicity!
From childhood up his natural drift
Was toward the ways of virtue,
Excess in which peculiar gift
Can seldom really hurt you.
Though swollen big from being small,
No airs does he assume;
He keeps the state of honest PAUL
Whose other name is Oom :
No proud tiara decks his poll,
He wears a common topper,
Having the economic soul
Ideal in a Dopper.
His only meal is mutton-broth,
He never tasted sack;
A coat of broad and sable cloth
Hangs down his modest back;
And though he paints his nether guise
With just a touch of tartan,
His tout ensemble justifies
The epithet of Spartan.
He sits at home with pensive brows,
Taxing his teeming brain
To answer wires about his spouse
From Mr. CHAMBERLAIN ;
And when at times the stress of things
Would tend to make him falter,
He clears his fluty throat and sings
A segment from the Psalter.
No courtly plumage puts he on,
Still humbly he behaves,
When sallying out to sit upon
His Raad of burgher braves;
Proceeding in a simple fly
Or Government four-wheeler,
He goes his way escorted by
A single mounted peeler.
II. —“AND on this.”
So sang I once, so told the charm
Of Oom's alluring grace;
But now I notice with alarm
A change has taken place:
Within the lute hegins to show
A rift of rude dimensions!
And feet of clay appear below
My idol's stern extensions!
For, see! the fallen one has bought
From Britain, over seas,
A Jubilee conveyance, wrought
With regal blazonries'
There flash the arms of early Boers
With fine heraldic feeling,
And eagles swarm about the doors
And also on the ceiling.
Some enemy has worked, I wis,
Upon his guileless age,
And jhim on to order this
Insidious equipage;
For now that, where the end is thin,
The wedge is once inserted,
His feet along the path of sin
Are hopelessly diverted.
Where will he stop? Far down the years
I see his tastes decline
On iewels bartered from De Beers,
Or some adiacent mine;
With costly liquors, long and warm,
I see his bosom flutter
Beneath a fetching uniform
Shaped by a German cutter!
How wanton pride may lead to shame
A CUT BENEATH HER.
Lady of the House. “Oh, Yes, JANE, I AskED MRs. Johnston to LET HER LITTLE Boy

From Afric's sultry clime)
At Capua, that giddy spot,
Indulged in hibernation,
Till all his gallant army got
Quite ill with enervation
O, Little England, dear to Ooml
I ask you, was it fair
To see him sent to certain doom
Through such a deadly snare?
And O, my LABBY l have you then
Sullied your latest laurels
By looking on while wicked men
Debauched a brother's morals?
THE GORDON HOTELANDERS.
(Summary of Meeting at the Métropole.)
MR. FREDERICK GoRDoN said he was
“gored on ” (“Oh! Oh!”) by his partners,
and so he acted agordonly. (“Oh! Oh!
Oh!”) Up to now he had always con-
sidered Sauce Hollandaise (cheers), an ex-
cellent thing. (“Hear!”). But it might
be made just a little too sharp. He had
read what had been said about him in the
Holland manifesto, and he might, if they
would allow him, sing from La Grande
Duchesse:—
“Woilà ce que l’on dit demoi
Dans la Gazette de Hollande! Ouil”
of everybody, that the friction would be
only temporary. (“Hear! Hear!”)
Sir BLUNDELL MAPLE said: I wish well to
all these hotel schemes, which, I am maple
to say (“Oh! Oh!”), are doing uncommonly
well. (“Bravo!”
Mr. Holland observed that he and his
brother, though a pair, were not to be
considered as “Double Dutchmen.” (“No!
No!”) He thought Mr. Gordon's quota-
tion from La Grande Dutch-esse rather
personal ; but, for his part, and compli-
menting the Chairman of the Gordon
Hotelanders on his vocal chords (“Hear!
Hear!”) he hoped sincerely that soon they
would all be in the same key, act in unison,
and that their voices henceforth would be
in harmony. (Enthusiastic applause.)
There was a show of hands, when every-
body shook everybody else's hand in the
cheeriest possible manner.
[We have since ascertained, too late, however,
to prevent this from going to press, that the above
report is an entire invention; but as it was evidently
conceived in a friendly spirit, it is to be hoped that
the real result will be as satisfactory as our False
Reporter has imagined it.—Ed.]

HINTS TO HOSTESSES.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Now that the country-house season is
commencing, would you grant me space to suggest certain im-
provements on the present system of entertainment? I would
say to the hostess : —
In the first place, let breakfast be a moveable feast, varying
from 9.30 A.M to, say mid-day, and let that horrible custom of
calling everybody beforehand at the same time be abolished for
ever. Also let the housemaids be forbidden to clatter about the
passages with brooms and pails during the earlier hours of the
day. I can't precisely fix which are the earlier hours; but what
I mean, wait till I am up and out. Order the cook (never mind
her grumbling) to have hot and hot dishes ready during the entire
forenoon. If a man likes lying in bed, don't bother him to go out
shooting, or riding, or driving. Don't expect, as a matter of course,
to see him at luncheon, and if he doesn't put in an appearance at
that melancholy meal, avoid making sarcastic inquiries as to the
state of his health when you do see him. Give the butler instruc-
tions to have whiskey, brandy, bottled beer, and soda-water per-
tually laid out in a convenient spot, for instance, on a table
in the billiard-room or smoking-room, where a thirsty indi-
vidual can quietly slake his mouth without going through the
absurd and semi-public ceremony of ringing the dining-room
bell. Never get up afternoon excursions to the celebrated places
in the neighbourhood, Castle Glorious, the seat of the Duke of
SPLENDower, or the ruins of Crackmedown Abbey, or the Weasel-
gutter Waterfall. On such occasions, in nine cases out of ten,
the guests in the conveyances are shaken together in as unsatis-
factory fashion as are travellers in an American railway car. Let
the coachman, however, understand that he is to be prepared to
send out carriages and pony-carts without any orders from the
host or hostess. Have “five-o'-clock” by all means, but don’t
expect your male guests to wander about with cups and plates of
bread and butter and cake, like waiters out of place. Before
dinner, don't pair off the company, but let each man select his
own partner. Avoid inviting any of the neighbouring big-wigs
to a grand repast, and strictly abstain from giving a county ball.
everyone foregathering later on in the drawing-room, to be bored
by mediocre music, wearied by the playing of infantine games,
or maddened by the influence of atrocious whist. Let everyone
have the right of passing directly from the dining-room, to the
billiard-room. Notify that everyone may go to bed when he
pleases, and can order grilled bones and devilled kidneys before
doing so. In short, Madam, turn your house into a free-and-easy
hotel. You will become very º: and never lack for visitors.

press. P. the country-house hostess. In all humility as a
practical reformer, I am, Your obedient servant,

WOTES AND WOX POPULI.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Now that the Municipal Elections are in
full swing, may I venture to suggest certain Golden Rules to
those who intend to cast their shells into the urn? They are
as follows:–
1. Always vote for the candidate who objects to lowering the
local rates, for as a rule he is an honest man, and has not got a
brother-in-law or cousin interested in the house-building, road-
making, or plumbing business, which the blatant Economist
invariably has.
2. Sign the nomination papers of as many philanthropists as
you are legally entitled to support. This will gain you immense
respect. B.—You need not poll in favour of these gentlemen.
On the contrary, give them the kick out of the ballot-box. They
will never know, and be eternally grateful.
3. Studiously inquire whether the whole-hearted individual
who solicits your vote has any ambition to become Mayor. If so,
discover whether it be likely that a knighthood be lurking in the
immediate future in consequence of some Royal Visit to the
borough.
4. § the polling day walk about with your voting-paper con-
spicuously exposed till a late hour in the evening. ... If discreet,
you will have an enjoyable time at the expense of other citizens,
and be able to light your pipe with the document when you are
smoking your ºil pipe at night. -
5. Cultivate the local wire-pullers, and ask them to lend you
the use of a carriage to drive about the borough.
6. Never give yourself away, or your vote. Without bribery
or corruption a voter may, on such an occasion, revel in otium
cum dig. at Bumbledom. Your obedient servant,
HERBERT HIEAway.

DARBY JONES ON THE GAMBRIDGESHIRE,
HoNoulted SIR,- Having provided you
and your friends with Winter Coals, I now
venture to essay to supply you and yours
with sundry Luxuries by naming the
Winner of the Cambridgeshire Stakes, a
race which some of the Greenhorns of
Turf Commerce appear to compare with
the Cesarewitch, quite forgetting the differ-
ence in distance and . It is indeed
astonishing how these Neophytes (an ex-
pression freshly culled from the excellent
Webster's Dictionary) imagine that an
animal that can do over two miles in proud
style, is equally useful at about half the
distance. You might just as well ask a
long-distance Human Plodder to win a
hundred yards competition. True it is
that more than once, as in the case of
Plaisanterie, the same quadruped has
caught the Judge's Eye on both occasions
but how rare have been these Freaks o
Fortune, and how carefully planned has
been the coup de grace? (Tarver's Anglo-
French Dictionary).
Believe me, honoured Sir, and I speak
with the authority of that fine sportsman,
Sir John Astºry, better known as “The
Mate,” that, in nine cases out of ten, a
Cesarewitch nag is not a Cambridgeshire
crock. And this should be remembered
when the lowlier sort of punters are send-
ing their Post-Office Orders to the Exiled
Bookmakers of Holland, with the expecta-
tion of a Double Event. This, by the
way, is an exceedingly difficult manoeuvre
to accomplish, and yet I have succeeded in
bringing it off quite recently with Diakka
in the Duke of York Stakes, and Merman
in the Cesarewitch.
A Noble Earl (I need not say whether of
British birth) who is beholden to me for
satisfactory advice on the subject, has, in
addition to forwarding me a substantial
cheque, sent me a basket of Norwegian
Ptarmigan. Inasmuch as I am strictly
forbidden by my Medical Man to touch
this Scandinavian Fowl, I have directed
the L. P. D. C. to convey the hamper to
vour palatial residence,” with a request
that you would pay the carriage. Your
thanks I accept beforehand, and now pro-
ceed to celebrate in metrical lines the
present great Equine Handicap of New-
market:—
The Balsam gent I don't admire,
To Yorkist claims do not asnire,
No Burning Ash my pen will fire,
But an Eastern Dame respect, Sir.
But I surelv in the 1, 2, 3,
A Yankee Saint expect to see,
And (with a run) the Jersey Lilie,
Her one of the two don't neglect, Sir.
Well aware that I have thrown priceless
chances to those Winds which blow about
the Cape of Good Hope, I write myself
down as usual, honoured Sir,
Your devoted minion,
DARBY Jones.
P.S.—At the same time remember that
a millionaire is not above picking up a pin.

DARBY JONES ON THE GAMBRIDGESHIRE.
HoNourted SIR,- Having provided you
and your friends with Winter Coals, I now
venture to essay to supply you and yours
with sundry Luxuries by naming the
Winner of the Cambridgeshire Stakes, a
race which some of the Greenhorns of
Turf Commerce appear to compare with
the Cesarewitch, quite forgetting the differ-
ence in distance and weight. It is indeed
astonishing how these Neophytes (an ex-
pression freshly culled from the excellent
Webster's Dictionaru) imagine that an
animal that can do over two miles in proud
style, is equally useful at about half the
distance. You might just as well ask a
long-distance Human Plodder to win a
hundred yards competition. True it is
that more than once, as in the case of
Plaisanterie, the same quadruped has
caught the judge's Eye on both occasions
but how rare have been these Freaks o
Fortune, and how carefully planned has
been the coup de grace? (Tarver's Anglo-
French Dictionary).
Believe me, honoured Sir, and I speak
with the authority of that fine sportsman,
Sir John Astºry, better known as “The
Mate,” that, in nine cases out of ten, a
Cesarewitch nag is not a Cambridgeshire
crock. And this should be remembered
when the lowlier sort of punters are send-
ing their Post-Office Orders to the Exiled
Bookmakers of Holland, with the expecta-
tion of a Double Event. This, by the
way, is an exceedingly difficult manoeuvre
to accomplish, and yet I have succeeded in
bringing it off quite recently with Diakka
in the Duke of York Stakes, and Merman
in the Cesarewitch.
A Noble Earl (I need not say whether of
British birth) who is beholden to me for
satisfactory advice on the subject, has, in
addition to forwarding me a substantial
cheque, sent me a basket of Norwegian
Ptarmigan. Inasmuch as I am strictly
forbidden by my Medical Man to touch
this Scandinavian Fowl, I have directed
the L. P. D. C. to convey the hamper to
vour palatial residence,” with a request
that you would pay the carriage. Your
thanks I accept beforehand, and now pro-
ceed to celebrate in metrical lines the
present great Equine Handicap of New-
market: —
The Balsam gent I don't admire,
To Yorkist claims do not asnire,
No Burning Ash my men will fire,
But an Eastern Dame respect, Sir.
But I surelvin the 1, 2, 3,
A Yankee Saint expect to see,
And-(with a run) the Jersey Lilie,
Her one of the two don't neglect, Sir.
Well aware that I have thrown priceless
chances to those Winds which blow about
the Cape of Good Hope, I write myself
down as usual, honoured Sir,
Your devoted minion,
DARBY Jones.

HINTS TO HOSTESSES.
DEAR MR. Punch,-Now that the country-house season is
commencing, would you grant me space to suggest certain im-
provements on the present system of entertainment? I would
say to the hostess : —
In the first place, let breakfast be a moveable feast, varying
from 9.30 A.M to, say mid-day, and let that horrible custom of
calling everybody beforehand at the same time be abolished for
ever. Also let the housemaids be forbidden to clatter about the
passages with brooms and pails during the earlier hours of the
day. I can't precisely fix which are the earlier hours; but what
I mean, wait till I am up and out. Order the cook (never mind
her grumbling) to have hot and hot dishes ready during the entire
forenoon. If a man likes lying in bed, don't bother him to go out
shooting, or riding, or driving. Don't expect, as a matter of course,
to see him at luncheon, and if he doesn't put in an appearance at
that melancholy meal, avoid making sarcastic inquiries as to the
state of his health when you do see him. Give the butler instruc-
tions to have whiskey, brandy, bottled beer, and soda-water per-
tually laid out in a convenient spot, for instance, on a table
in the billiard-room or smoking-room, where a thirsty indi-
vidual can quietly slake his mouth without going through the
absurd and semi-public ceremony of ringing the dining-room
bell. Never get up afternoon excursions to the celebrated places
in the neighbourhood, Castle Glorious, the seat of the Duke of
SPLENDower, or the ruins of Crackmedown Abbey, or the Weasel-
gutter Waterfall. On such occasions, in nine cases out of ten,
the guests in the conveyances are shaken together in as unsatis-
| factory fashion as are travellers in an American railway car. Let
the coachman, however, understand that he is to be prepared to
send out carriages and pony-carts without any orders from the
host or hostess. Have “five-o'-clock” by all means, but don't
expect your male guests to wander about with cups and plates of
bread and butter and cake, like waiters out of place. Before
dinner, don't pair off the company, but let each man select his
own partner. "Avoid inviting any of the neighbouring big-wigs
to a grand repast, and strictly abstain from giving a county ball.
everyone foregathering later on in the drawing-room, to be bored
by mediocre music, wearied by the playing of infantine games,
or maddened by the influence of atrocious whist. Let everyone
have the right of passing directly from the dining-room, to the
billiard-room. Notify that everyone may go to bed when he
pleases, and can order grilled bones and devilled kidneys before
doing so. In short, Madam, turn your house into a free-and-easy
hotel... You will become very popular, and never lack for visitors.
Such, Mr. Punch, is the advice which I would earnestly im-
press. P. the country-house hostess. In all humility as a
practical reformer, I am, Your obedient servant,

P.S.—I could refer to other phases of the question, but all the
clauses of a reform bill cannot be carried at the first attempt.

WOTES AND WOX POPULI.
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,-Now that the Municipal Elections are in
full swing, may I venture to suggest certain Golden Rules to
those who intend to cast their shells into the urn? They are
as follows:–
1. Always vote for the candidate who objects to lowering the
local rates, for as a rule he is an honest man, and not got a
brother-in-law or cousin interested in the house-building, road-
making, or plumbing business, which the blatant Economist
invariably has.
2. Sign the nomination papers of as many philanthropists as
you are legally entitled to support. This will gain you immense
respect. N.B.-You need not poll in favour of these gentlemen.
On the contrary, give them the kick out of the ballot-box. They
will never know, and be eternally grateful.
3. Studiously inquire whether the whole-hearted individual
who solicits your vote has any ambition to become Mayor. If so,
discover whether it be likely that a knighthood be lurking in the
immediate future in consequence of some Royal Visit to the
borough.
4. On the polling day walk about with your voting-paper con-
spicuously exposed till a late hour in the evening. ... If discreet,
you will have an enjoyable time at the expense of other citizens,
and be able to light your pipe with the document when you are
smoking your ºiſ pipe at night. -
5. Cultivate the local wire-pullers, and ask them to lend you
the use of a carriage to drive about the borough.
6. Never give yourself away, or your vote. Without bribery
or corruption a voter may, on such an occasion, revel in otium
cum dig. at Bumbledom. Your obedient servant,
HERBERT HIEAway.

A VOICE FROM NELSON'S COLUMN.
(Heard on the occasion of the Anniversary.)
Yes, it is all very well to cover my column with leaves, but
could they not do a little more? Quite right to keep my
memory green, but . fame ought to be protected with equal
care. I suppose I ought not to complain. Nowadays, everybody
is abused. P daresay that the good fellows I see beneath me have
all been subjected to criticism. No doubt NAPIER has been
called incompetent, GoRDoN a bigot, and Havelock a slow-
coach. But some league or other is sure to look after our
destals. Even His Kºjº, CHARLEs THE FIRST is afforded a
ouquet or two. They took years to build my column; more
years to cast my lions; more years, yet to remember my...anni-
versary. Well, they have got the date at last, and my pillar is
in the hands of blue-jackets vice steeple-jack superseded. ...
All this is quite right and proper. But what I should like to
know is, why I am attacked about my battles? Thanks to my
friend Admiral Sir Vesey HAMILTON, my fame, has been pro-
tected. All honour to the Service Magazine that printed his
ºvindication.” But the leaves that called it forth are not like
those around my plinth. Those I see below, me are Nature's
handiwork—green and pleasant. After all, they are more in-
structive of the appreciation in which I am held by my country
than those other leaves—made of paper.

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
No. I.--To Wiscount Esher, LATE MASTER of the Rolls.
My LoRD,--It would not be right that an event so momentous
as your retirement from the Bench, that for so many years you
have adorned, should pass unnoticed by Mr. Punch, your friend
and admirer.
Our judicial system is to-day poorer by the loss of a real man.
Time and again has he who pens these lines watched you as you
burst your way with masculine force through the tangled
web of sophistries that too often passes for legal acumen.
What were precedents to you if precedents told against your
view of what was right? You ** always distinguish, as the
lawyers say, and if your distinctions toppled over for ever the
decided cases in which the unwisdom of your musty predecessors
had had full scope, so much the worse for the decided cases and
so much the better, it may be added, for good sense and
sound law.
They said you were rough in your speech, that you did not
check in time the crushing remark provoked by boredom, stu-
pidity or perversity. It may be so. Osric was never your model
of manners, and, in truth, an Osric on the Bench would be a
melancholy sight. And sometimes the animal spirits that have
carried you vigorously from your stalwart undergraduate days,
through the rough and tumble of a barrister's and a Judge's life,
up to the moment of your retirement, would break out irre-
pressibly amid the pompous gloom of your Appeal Court, and
you would revel in a wordy contest with all the zest of a Caius
man belabouring a Barnwell bargee. They still do these things
at Caius, I am told, when the occasion requires, and I warrant
that you, the noblest Caian of them all, would be the last to
blame the happy diversions of youth.
But, rough or otherwise, you were sterling to the core, and as

wheedled: no man can say that he ever succeeded in humbuggin
you, or that, if he tried to, he brought anything but sorrow an
bruised bones out of the conflict. #. being a man you liked a
mºn, though he might be your temporary opponent, and the
robust energy that urged you to a bout of mental fisticuffs caused
you to treat, as a mere nothing any blow that might descend on
your own skull during the encounter. You forgave and were
forgiven; you ºr. and were respected.
And through all the turmoil and the conflict, highly placed and
honoured as you were, you preserved ever a happy memory of
the days of your youth when BRETT of Caius was a name to con-
jure, with in the world of oarsmen. BRETT of Caius, who, as a
brother Judge sang of him : —
—rowed seven to STANLEY,
Every inch the Judge—the man;
Upright, downright, comely, manly,
Beat him, Oxford, if you can!
And I cannot doubt that the ancient medals that bore testimony
to your aquatic prowess on the tideway, and at Henley, are still
amongst your most cherished and delightful ssions. Others
might stiffen and totter and forget, but with you the athlete's
delight in conflict, the joyous spirit of abounding vitality that
bore you on when your sinews were cracking and your breast was
heaving in the fierce stress of a boat-race, the fighter's deter-
mination to win or to die—these were and are yours still as when
you sat behind STANLEY and helped to snatch victory from the
men in dark blue.
How genially, too, and with what tact and humour have you
presided over the Boat-race dinners. The youngsters who had
rowed rejoiced in your speeches, and always cheered you to the
echo. Once, as I have heard, when having temporarily vacated
the chairman's seat you were strolling round the tables, you
paused behind a lad, who, somewhat inspired by Bacchus, was lustily

kindly as you were sterling. Others might be cajoled or
shouting, “Good old Esher,” a call which, though it showed

Lord Justice might seem to require. On him still shouting, and
unaware of your presence at his back, you laid a paternal hand:
“My dear boy,” you said, “I’m afraid your head will ache to-
mºrrow, I once shouted, like that myself, and—well, my head
ached the next morning,” and with that you passed on, leaving
the boy reduced to a surprised and unwonted silence.’ It may
interest you to know that he subsequently declared you wer.
“a ripper.”
And now you are gone into a retirement which we all wish may
be as peaceful and pleasant as it is honourable. We shall mis,
you. Often, when some prosy dryasdust is laying down the law.
we shall long for those refreshing gusts of vigorous common sens,

HAND AND GLOVE AT THE AQUARIUM.
It's wonderful! Marvellous! the reproduction of the great
fight between Fitzsimmons and Corbert by Fisticuffographic
Process at the Aquarium! They “come like shadows, so de
part,” and I fancy the Witches in their cave knew this trick and
presented a series of “living pictures” for the instruction and
amusement of Macbeth. By the way, herein is a hint for Mr
Forbes Robertson should he wish to give this Shakspearian
3rama with genuine novel effects. Or, why should not the
“living pictures” be given in the Play Scene in Hamlet f Bul
this, by the way. A nos mute-'unst For they don't speak a
word! Not a sound to be heard Except the whirring of the
machinery. O my head! Never was there so dense and so
silent a crowd living, moving, waving hands, and doing all that
mortal men can do except speak.
Never having seen a prize-fight, I had imagined that two
athletes stripped to the waist, as they appear in prints of cham-
pion pugilists, would gracefully stand up to each other until one
of them could stand up no longer, the interval being occupied in
“squaring up,” “hitting out,” “slogging,” “landing” each other
“one on t nut,” and, in a general way, exhibiting what
muscle, training, and science can effect. Consequently I was
considerably astonished at finding these two champions, who seem
to hate one another like poison, that is, if the refusal of Fitz-
SIMMONs to shake hands with Corbett is to be taken as an indica-
tion of this deadly inimical sentiment, occupying the greater §.
of the time taken up by the encounter in getting quite close
together, and apparently hugging each other in so loving an
embrace that they find the greatest difficulty in parting; in fact
FITZSIMMONs seemed quite sorry to let CoRBETT go, and vice versá.
Sometimes they dance, and hop, and hurry, and scurry round
the ring, but, as it always seems, with only one aim and end,
namely, that FITzsIMMONs is so deeply attached to CoRBET,
(or CoRBETT to Fitzsimmons, it does not matter which) as to be
perpetually making for him, with a view to taking him to his
arms, and giving him just another hug for old acquaintance sake
and to show that, though at the commencement he had refused
to go through the formality of shaking hands, yet he was
desperately attached to him, and only wanted to take him to his

THE FIRST BOARD MEETING, BY OUR PROPHETIC CHINESE ARTIST.
LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
No. I.--To Wiscount Esher, LATE MAstER of the Rolls.
My Lord, It would not be right that an event so momentous
as your retirement from the Bench, that for so many years you
have adorned, should pass unnoticed by Mr. Punch, your friend
and admirer.
Our judicial system is to-day poorer by the loss of a real man.
Time and again has he who pens these lines watched you as you
burst your way with masculine force through the tangled
web of sophistries that too often passes for legal acumen.
What were precedents to you if precedents told against your
view of what was right? You ** always distinguish, as the
lawyers say, and if your distinctions toppled over for ever the
decided cases in which the unwisdom of your musty predecessors
had had full scope, so much the worse for the decided cases and
so much the better, it may be added, for good sense and
sound law.
They said you were rough in your speech
check in time the crushing remark provoked by boredom, stu-
pidity or perversity. It may be so. Osric was never your model
of manners, and, in truth, an Osric on the Bench would be a
melancholy sight. And sometimes the animal spirits that have
carried you vigorously from your stalwart undergraduate days,
through the rough and tumble of a barrister's and a Judge's life,
up to the moment of your retirement, would break out irre-
pressibly amid the pompous gloom of your Appeal Court, and
you would revel in a wordy contest with all the zest of a Caius
man belabouring a Barnwell bargee. They still do these things
at Caius, I am told, when the occasion requires, and I warrant
that you, the noblest Caian of them all, would be the last to
blame the happy diversions of youth.
But, rough or otherwise, you were sterling to the core, and that you did not
as you were sterling. Others might be cajoled or shouting, “Good wheedled: no man can say that he ever succeeded in humbuggin
you, or that, if he tried to, he brought anything but sorrow an
bruised bones out of the conflict. #. being a man you liked a
man, though he might be your temporary opponent, and the
robust energy that urged you to a bout of mental fisticuffs caused
you to treat, as a mere nothing any blow that might descend on
your own skull during the encounter. You forgave and were
forgiven; you ºf. and were respected.
And through all the turmoil and the conflict, highly placed and
honoured as you were, you preserved ever a happy memory of
the days of your youth when BRETT of Caius was a name to con-
jure with in the world of oarsmen. BRETT of Caius, who, as a
rother Judge sang of him :-
—rowed seven to STANLEY,
Every inch the Judge—the man;
Upright, downright, comely, manly,
Beat him, Oxford, if you can!
And I cannot doubt that the ancient medals that bore testimony
to your aquatic prowess on the tideway, and at Henley, are still
amongst your most cherished and delightful possessions. Others
might stiffen and totter and forget, but with you the athlete's
delight in conflict, the joyous spirit of abounding vitality that
bore you on when your sinews were cracking and your breast was
heaving in the fierce stress of a boat-race, the fighter's deter-
mination to win or to die—these were and are yours still as when
you sat behind STANLEY and helped to snatch victory from the
men in dark blue.
How genially, too, and with what tact and humour have you
presided over the Boat-race dinners. The youngsters who had
rowed rejoiced in your speeches, and always cheered you to the
echo. Once, as I have heard, when having temporarily vacated
the chairman's seat you were, strolling round the tables, you
paused behind a lad, 
kindly as
who, somewhat inspired by Bacchus,was lustily
£siºn,” a call which, though it showed

enthusiasm, was not altogether so respectful as the dignity of a
Lord Justice might seem to require. On him still shouting, and
unaware of your presence at his back, you laid a paternal hand:
“My dear boy,” you said, “I’m afraid your head will ache to-
morrºw, I once shouted like that myself, and—well, my head
ached the next morning,” and with that you passed on, leaving
the boy reduced to a surprised and unwonted silence." It may
interest yºu to know that he subsequently declared you wer
a ripper.
And now you are gone into a retirement which we all wish may
be as peaceful and pleasant as it is honourable. We shall miss
you. Often, when some prosy dryasdust is laying down the law.
we shall long for those refreshing gusts of vigorous common sens,
that swept through your Court when you presided over it. Thes,
we shall not feel again, but your example of manly strength and
robust insight and unswerving rectitude in word and deed will re
main with us unforgotten .# undimmed through the years that
are to come. I am, my Lord, with deep respect,
Your faithful servant, THE WAGRANT.
HAND AND GLOVE AT THE AQUARIUM.
It's wonderful! Marvellous! the reproduction of the great
fight between Fitzsimmons and Corbert by Fisticuffographi
Process at the Aquarium! They “come like shadows, so de
part,” and I fancy the Witches in their cave knew this trick and
presented a series of “living pictures” for the instruction and
amusement of Macbeth. By the way, herein is a hint for Mr
Forbes Robertson should he wish to give this Shakspearian
drama with genuine novel, effects. Or, why should not the
“living pictures” be given in the Play Scene in Hamlet f Bul
this, by the way. A nos mute-'uns! For they don't speak a
word! Not a sound to be heard! Except the whirring of the
machinery. O my head! Never was there so dense and so
silent a crowd living, moving, waving hands, and doing all that
mortal men can do except speak.
Never having seen a prize-fight, I had imagined that two
athletes stripped to the waist, as they appear in prints of cham-
pion pugilists, would gracefully stand up to each other until one
of them could stand up no longer, the interval being occupied in
“squaring up,” “hitting out,” “slogging,” “landing” each other
“one on t nut,” and, in a general way, exhibiting what
muscle, training, and science can effect. Consequently I was
considerably astonished at finding these two champions, who seem
to hate one another like poison, that is, if the refusal of FITz-
SIMMONs to shake hands with Corbett is to be taken as an indica-
tion of this deadly inimical sentiment, occupying the greater
of the time taken up by the encounter in getting quite close
together, and ..º.º. hugging each other in so loving an
embrace that they find the greatest difficulty in parting; in fact
Frtzsimmons seemed quite sorry to let CoRBETT go, and vice versá.
Sometimes they dance, and hop, and hurry, and scurry round
the ring, but, as it always seems, with only one aim and end,
namely, that FITzsimmons is so deeply attached to CoRBET,
(or CoRBETT to Fitzsimmons, it does not matter, which) as to be
perpetually making for him, with a view to taking him to his
arms, and giving him just another hug for old acquaintance sake
and to show that, though at the commencement he had refused
to go through the formality of shaking hands, yet he was
desperately attached to him, and only wanted to take him to his
heart and whisper the touching truth, in his ear. All this time
the two champions are being %. about all over the place
by a stout man in shirt-sleeves, light tie, and high collar, whom
at first I took to be a kind of clergyman of some persuasion,
skipping about to avoid their both, hitting him or treading on
his toes, and, probably, perpetually reminding them, of Dr.
WATTs' hymn, how, “Dogs might delight to bark, and bite,” and
“Lions to growl and fight,” but that for a couple of Christians
to be engaged in a deadly pummeling encounter was not a seemly
spectacle, nor a good example to set to the thousands of specta:
tors there gathered together. However, it was soon explained
to me that this stout personage, something between a genial
elderly parson and a robust landlord of a public house, was
GeoRae "SILER, of Chicago, the referee. A nice time he must
have had of it! Once he was nearly sent over the ropes with

The fight continues. Sometimes they are in the full clear
light of day, but in a steady pelt of rain or snow, at , other
times they are all in shadow and a heavy storm is pouring down;
but whether in light or shade, all the figures, principals and crowd,

A LIBERAL EDUCATION.
[“Another “ex-head-master,’ with an experience
of seventeen years as head of a public school, seri-
ously asks whether it would not be better to teach
boys chess than Latin verses.”—St. James's Gazette,
Oct. 18.1
MEssrs. TEACHEM AND TRAINEMUP beg
to call the attention of parents to the
unique educational advantages offered by
them at Cramwell College. The gratifying
successes achieved by many of their former
pupils give the best testimony to the merit
of their system, which has completely
superseded the old-fashioned theories of
education. Their terms for boarders be-
tween the ages of ten and eighteen are
£200 per annum, which will appear a very
moderate figure when the expense involved
in maintaining their brilliant staff of
assistant-masters is taken into considera-
tion. The following subjects, amongst
others, are taught with the greatest care :
1. Lessons in Chess are given to every
boy in the upper school, under the direc-
tion of Professor GAMBIT, the well-known
player. Two hours a day are set aside for
this subject, and there are examinations
in end-games and problems every week,
besides a tournament at the close of each
term, by which the boy's place in class is
finally decided. It is clearly recognised
nowadays that Chess is a far more valuable
study than any of the worthless dead lan-
guages. Bovs in the middle school are
taught Draughts, while thos” in the lower
school are thoroughly grounded in Halma.
2. While Chess replaces, as has been
indicated, the study of Latin and Greek,
it has been found that Billiards forms an
admirable substitute for mathematics.
And, considering the enormous educa’ional
importance of this game, we have added
that celebrated player, Mr. WYNNYNGE
HAZARDE, to our staff of masters. Each
boy is expected to bring to school at the
beginning of term his own cue and a dozen
pieces of chalk. The lower forms are given
lessons in Bagatelle as a stepping-stone to
the nobler game, and no one is admitted
to the unner fifth until he has made a break
of over twenty. Indeed, conscious of our
responsibility towards the rising genera-
tion, we take the utmost pains that our
pupils shall receive the best possible teach.
ing in this all-important subject. And that
we have not been altogether unsuccessful
is shown by the number of important and
responsible posts now filled by old Cram-
wellians. The markers at the “Spotted
Dog” of Hounsditch, the “Red Lion” of
Tooting, the “White Hart” at Puddleton,
and many others, all received their early
training at Cramwell College.
3. In the place of modern languages,
history, and geography—useless subjects
too long retained in the ordinary scholastic
curriculum—our pupils are instructed in
the game of whist by Professor TRUMP-
STER, whose name is a guarantee of the
excellence of the teaching. Parents are
requested to provide their sons with five
shillings a week as card-money during
term-time. In addition to the ordinary
prizes, we offer annually a scholarship
of £10 for especial merit in whist. The
| present holder is Master BRowN major,
aged seventeen, who gained the distinc-
tion by his essay “On American Leads,
with an excursus on Finessing.” Pro-
fessor TRUMPstER also lectures on Ecarté,
Picquet, and Bézique, while another
Professor (who prefers to remain name-

a large and lucrative practice), gives in-
struction in the Three-Card Trick to those
boys whose parents wish it. An extra fee
of £10 is charged for this course, which,
however, will ensure for each pupil who
masters it a constant source of income in
future years. Lessons are also given to
the junior forms in Dominoes, Beggar-my-
Neighbour, and Spillikins. It will thus be
seen that the educational course at Cram-
well College thoroughly prepares the boys
for their subsequent careers in the world,
and the improvement on the old form of
public-school education is indeed enormous.
From time to time parents inquire
whether we give our pupils any instruction
at all in such subjects as mathematics,
history, geography and languages. Of
course we cannot allow the hours which
should be devoted to the serious study of
games to be frittered away upon such
trivial subjects as these. But we have no
objection to allowing a boy to read, for
instance, EUCLID and THUCYDIDEs in his
playtime. Only it must-be clearly recog-
&c., is of far more real importance to him,
and that these other, more frivolous, stu-
dies must be kept in their proper place.
Messrs. TEACHEM AND TRAINEMUp will be
delighted to answer any questions from
parents who think of entrusting their sons
to their charge, and, for a testimonial to
the worth of their system, can refer en-
quirers to “an ex-head-master, with an
experience of seventeen years.”

I AM DE
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
HER MAJESTY has had many gifts presented to her in Jubilee
Year. Possibly none is more prized, few could be more magnifi-
cent, than the dedication of The Orford Dictionary, the third
volume of which has inst issued from the diarendon Press under
the direction of Mr. HENRY FRowde. Lord ALDENHAM, in addi-
tion to contributing two sons to the House of Commons, read all
through the proof-sheets of the first volume. My Baronite sits
amazed at contemnlation of all he must know. SHAkspeaRE
managed to write his plays with the employment of 20,000
words. Dr. MURRAY and his coadjutors in the work of The
Orford Dictionary, have as yet approached only the sixth
letter of the alphabet. Yet they have exhaustively dealt
with over 97,000 words. The erudition displayed is equalled
by the aptness and ingenuity of the illustrations drawn from the
field of the world's literature. Nothing on the same scale has
ever been attempted. Nothing approaching it has ever been
accomplished. The work, undertaken fifteen years ago, will,
according to present plans, be finished in the year 1910—a superb
legacy left by the nineteenth century to its successor.
Do not be frightened by the title of one of S. BARING-Gould's
most recent novels, Bladys of the Stewponey. It is not a warn-
ing to hippophagists given to stewing and devouring ponies.
“The Stewponey” was originally “The Estepona Tavern,” and
who Bladys was, and how she became associated with the
Stewronev, and what consequences to the charming heroine re-
sulted therefrom, is it not all written in this book, and is not the
book worth reading? Most decidedly. 'Tis as interesting a
tale as has ever come out of the head of the ready-writing author,
whose only error. to the Baron's thinking, is, that he has written
a preface to it, which is not calculated to assist the romance, but,
by telling you “how it’s done,” rather detracts from the story.
Avoid the preface until you have finished the story. It is very
well illustrated by Messrs. Townsend and MUNNs, and is pub-
Too many cooks spoil the broth. That is the proverbial rule:
to which the clearly-typed, well-written and well-bound little
volume, called, London in the time of the Diamond Jubilee, is a
most decided exception, although its authors are EMILY CoN-
st ANCE, Cook and § T. Cook, M.A. This Cookery Book is
edited by RALPH DARLINGToN, fit.G.s., and published at Llan-
gollen by DARLINGTON, whose name (Town of the Darling) is so
suggestive of “Sweet JENNY Jones, the maid of Llangollen,”
and by SIMPKIN, MARSHALL & Co., in London. It is well illus.
trated, full of useful information, and fitted with maps, which
have to be taken up tenderly, unfolded with care, and examined
with the aid of a magnifier. with this book as his uide, philoso-
pher, and friend, the stranger in the land will find himself quite
at home, and should never be compelled to “ask a policeman,”
or to declare that “he dunno where he are.”
In their pocket éditions de lure of the “Temple Classics,”
edited by IsrAEL GoLLANcz, M.A., Messrs. DENT & Co., of
Aldine House, have already given us such argumenta ad pocketum
as no collector of daintily-got-up and clearly-printed books can
withstand. By way of adding to these literary travel-
ling companions, bound, most handsomely, to with us every-
where by sea or land, the same Aldine House has commenced a
new series of Sir Wairºa Scott's novels, with useful glossary
and notes; the first volume of Waverley being prefaced by an
interesting Biographical Note by Mr. CLEMENT šº. a name
of good omen where to give multum in parvo is the main object.
THE BARON DE B.-W.
ABROAD IN THE AUTUMN.
Salzburg.—Across the Austrian frontier. Usual discomforts on
entering another country. Custom House. Fresh customs,
as usual, but not fresh manners. Yet perhaps more man-
ners than in Germany. Also different money, and such
money! The florin, the gulden, the krone, the kreutzer
and the heller are bad enough. Add to these the Hun-
garian translations korona and fillér, and you have seven names
to puzzle the foreigner. Then you reckon everything in kreut-
zers, and you inscribe the coins with the value in hellers.
Imagine in England all the small coins being reckoned in far-
things and marked in half-farthings. Also the change for a
shilling being always farthings and threepenny-pieces—the latter
in nickel so similar in size and colour to a shilling that one would
need a strong light to distinguish them. -
If that were the case, an Austrian tourist in London, having
reckoned that the cab-fare for a very short distance should be
forty-eight farthings, might in the dark hand to the cabman a
nickel threepenny-bit instead of a piece of ninety-six half-far-
things. Then, perhaps, you can—I cannot—imagine the remarks
of the cabman, and the futile efforts of the Austrian to find “two
bob” amongst the pieces of paper, silver, nickel and bronze in
his mocket. Such, reversed, is the unpleasant position of the
Englishman in Austria.
Salzburg is an interesting old city—so interesting that it is
being rapidly improved out of existence by an Improvement
Association, and so old that at every street-corner you find a
horse-tramcar, or a steam-tramcar, or an electric-tramcar, or a
railway up the hill, or a railway down the hill, or a funicular rail-
way, or something mediaeval of that, sort. There is a castle, in
the most picturesque situation imaginable, to which you go up
in a lift, and, when you have been lifted right to the top, you
find an ancient terrace, commanding a delightful view over snow-
capped mountains and fertile valleys, and on the terrace half-a-
dozen young ladies discussing the objects of interest in Ameri-
kanisch. And there is an hotel, where you might suppose that
you were not in Austria at all, seeing that everyone speaks
English, and that the menu is in French, and that there is an
American bar in the hall, where you can find all the cocktails
you want. In England you may not so very frequently, eat
“Roastboeuf,” “Irishstew,” “Cheste Cheese,” “Mixed Pikles,”
and similar delicacies; in Austria you can have them all daily—
twice daily, if you like.

not go to Salzburg, but to an hotel in a neighbouring village, the
name of which need not be mentioned, thus advertised in the
English language:

One might obtain captivating meats elsewhere, but accomplished

TAR–MADE IN GERMANY.
Mr. Punch. “HULL0 ! WHO ARE You ?”
Jack Tar. “MINE FREEND, Do You Not KNow ME? I AM DE
BRIDISH SAILok.”
[According to the report just issued by the Registrar-General of Shipping
and Seamen, British ships are becoming more and more manned by foreigners,
and in the process of time, the British seaman will be as extinct as the Dodo.
Out of 125,009 seamen employed last year in British sailing ships and
steamers, 27,446 were foreigners.]
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Her MAJESTY has had many gifts presented to her in Jubilee
Year. Possibly none is more prized, few could be more magnifi-
cent, than the dedication of The Orford Dictionary, the third
volume of which has just issued from the Clarendon Press under
the direction of Mr. HENRY FRowde. Lord ALDENHAM, in addi-
tion to contributing two sons to the House of Commons, read all
through the proof-sheets of the first volume. My Baronite sits
amazed at contemnlation of all he must know. SHAKspeARE
managed to write his plays with the employment of 20,000
words. Dr. MURRAY and his coadjutors in the work of The
Orford Dictionary, have as yet approached only the sixth
letter of the alphabet. Yet they ve exhaustively dealt
with over 97,000 words. The erudition displayed is equalled
by the aptness and ingenuity of the illustrations drawn from the
field of the world's literature. Nothing on the same scale has
ever been attempted. Nothing approaching it has ever been
accomplished. The work, undertaken fifteen years ago, will.
according to present plans, be finished in the year 1910—a superb
legacy left by the nineteenth century to its successor.
Do not be frightened by the title of one of S. BARING-Gould's
most recent novels, Bladys of the Stewponey. It is not a warn-
ing to hippophagists given to stewing and devouring ponies.
“The Stewponey” was originally “The Estepona Tavern,” and
who Bladys was, and how she became associated with the
Stewronev, and what consequences to the charming heroine re-
sulted therefrom, is it not all written in this book, and is not the
book worth reading P. Most decidedly. 'Tis as interesting a
tale as has ever come out of the head of the ready-writing author,
whose only error, to the Baron's thinking, is, that he has written
a preface to it, which is not calculated to assist the romance, but,
by telling you “how it’s done,” rather detracts from the story.
Avoid the preface until you have finished the story. It is very
well illustrated by Messrs. Townsend and MuNNs, and is pub-
Too many cooks spoil the broth. That is the proverbial rule:
to which the clearly-typed, well-written and well-bound little
volume, called, London in the time of the Diamond Jubilee, is a
most decided .* although its authors are EMILY CoN-
STANCE, Cook and E. T. Cook, M.A. This Cookery Book is
edited by RALPH DARLINGToN, F.R.G.S., and published at Llan-
gollen by DARLINGTON, whose name (Town of the Darling) is so
º of “Sweet JENNY Jones, the maid of Llangollen,”
and by SIMPKIN, MARSHALL & Co., in London. It is well illus.
trated, full of useful information, and fitted with maps, which
have to be taken up tenderly, unfolded with care, and examined
with the aid of a magnifier. With this book as his guide, philoso-
pher, and friend, the stranger in the land will find himself quite
at home, and should never be compelled to “ask a policeman,”
or to declare that “he dunno where he are.”
In their pocket éditions de lure of the “Temple Classics,”
edited by IsrAEL GoLLANCz, M.A., Messrs. DENT & Co., of
Aldine House, have already given us such argumenta ad pocketum
as no collector of daintily-got-up and clearly-printed books can
withstand. By way of adding to these literary travel-
ling companions, bound, most handsomely, to with us every-
where by sea, or land, the same Aldine House has commenced a
new series of Sir Wairºn Scott's novels, with useful glossary
and notes; the first volume of Waverley being prefaced by an
interesting Biographical Note by Mr. CLEMENT SHoRTER, a name
of good omen where to give multum in parvo is the main object.
THE BARON DE B.-W.
ABROAD IN THE AUTUMN.
Salzburg.—Across the Austrian frontier. Usual discomforts on
entering another country. Custom House. Fresh customs,
as usual, but not fresh manners. Yet perhaps more man-
ners than in Germany. Also different money, and such
money ! The florin, the gulden, the krone, the kreutzer
and the heller are bad enough. Add to these the Hun-
garian translations korona and fillér, and you have seven names
to puzzle the foreigner. Then you reckon everything in kreut-
zers, and you inscribe the coins with the value in hellers.
Imagine in England all the small coins being reckoned in far-
things and marked in half-farthings. Also the change for a
shilling being always farthings and threepenny-pieces—the latter
in nickel so similar in size and colour to a shilling that one would
need a strong light to distinguish them.
If that were the case, an Austrian tourist in London, having
reckoned that the cab-fare for a very short distance should be
forty-eight farthings, might in the dark hand to the cabman a
nickel threepenny-bit instead of a piece of ninety-six half-far-
things. Then, perhaps, you can—I cannot—imagine the remarks
of the cabman, and the futile efforts of the Austrian to find “two
bob” amongst the pieces of paper, silver, nickel and bronze in
his mocket. Such, reversed, is the unpleasant position of the
Englishman in Austria.
Salzburg is an interesting old city—so interesting that it is
being rapidly improved out of existence by an Improvement
Association, and so old that at every street-corner you find a
horse-tramcar, or a steam-tramcar, or an electric-tramcar, or a
railway up the hill, or a railway down the hill, or a funicular rail-
way, or something mediaeval of that sort. There is a castle, in
the most picturesque situation imaginable, to which you go up
in a lift, and, when you have been lifted right to the top, you
find an ancient terrace, commanding a delightful view over snow-
capped mountains and fertile valleys, and on the terrace half-a-
dozen young ladies discussing the objects of interest in Ameri-
kanisch. And there is an hotel, where you might suppose that
you were not in Austria at all, seeing that everyone speaks
English, and that the menu is in French, and that there is an
American bar in the hall, where you can find all the cocktails
you want. In England you may not so very frequently eat
“Roastboeuf,” “Irishstew,” “Cheste Cheese,” “Mixed Pikles,”
and similar delicacies; in Austria you can have them all daily—
twice daily, if you like.
But if you want something superlatively excellent, you should
not go to Salzburg, but to an hotel in a neighbouring village, the
name of which need not be mentioned, thus advertised in the
English language:
“Post Hotel in—. Charming view, fine anartments, accom-
plished drink, cantivating meats, baths in hotel, &c.”
One might obtain captivating meats elsewhere, but accomplished
drink is a luxury unknown except in that hotel. What are the
ingredients? Robinson THE Rover.

OH ! patent marvel of our time,
Your vagaries I'll celebrate
In more or less prosaic rhyme,
For lack of penny chocolate.
I’ve forty minutes now to kill
Upon this fatuous single line,
That climbs each eastern Sussex hill
In corkscrew curves of mad design.
To cool my heels is scarcely fun
In this most uninviting hole,
Refreshed by no seductive bun,
No “four of Scotch,” nor sausage-roll.
Your coy, retiring slot I greet,
That shall my appetite beguile
With blameless automatic sweet—
I’ve longed for food a goodish while !
Come, here's the necessary coin
I tender your secretive maw;
“Grace before meat,” I nearly join,
In eager haste my prize to draw.
I push it in—it disappears,
The solitary bronze I own;
I wait with mingled hopes and fears—
Shall I succeed or starve alone P

Confound, I say, such knavish tricks,

ODE TO A SLOT-MACHINE.
(Written by way of Protest at a wayside Station
on the Line from Tonbridge to Eastbourne.)
OH ! patent marvel of our time,
Your vagaries I'll celebrate
In more or less prosaic ..
For lack of penny chocolate
I've forty minutes now to kill
Upon this fatuous single line,
That climbs each eastern Sussex hill
In corkscrew curves of mad design.
To cool my heels is scarcely fun
In this most uninviting hole,
Refreshed by no seductive bun,
No “four of Scotch,” nor sausage-roll.
Your coy, retiring slot I greet,
That shall my appetite beguile
With blameless automatic sweet—
I’ve longed for food a goodish while !
Come, here's the necessary coin
I tender your secretive maw;
“Grace before meat,” I nearly join,
In eager haste my prize to draw.
I push it in—it disappears,
The solitary bronze I own;
I wait with mingled hopes and fears—
Shall I succeed or starve alone?
A F. loiters idly by,
nd marks my half-concealed attempt ;
He mocks, with much too knowing eye,
My hungry look, my hair unkempt.
Why, what's the matter? Something
sticks,
I’ve been befooled and drawn a blank;
Confound, I say, such knavish tricks,
The man who made the thing's a crank!
And so my praise is turned to blame;
“Ode to ”—I started, but I mean
(As I my penn'orth vainly claim)
That I'm “Owed by a slot-machine!”
PROVERBS RE-SET.
(By our Vague Impressionist.)
It's no use crying wolf when the fire is
out.
Take a pitcher to a well too often and it
will look over a garden wall.
What is one man's meat is another king's
Tansom.
People who live in glass houses should
| close the stable-door before they are stolen.
A fox who likes sour grapes knows its
own father.
Take care of the pence and you will
have enough for lunch in the b
A cat may look at a sow's ear and yet
be sold for a sheep and a lamb.
Convince a man against his will and
hang him.
Give a dog an inch and he will soon
come home to roost.
A penny in time costs nothing.
When poverty is gold what is the use of
silver?
A nod is as good as a mile to the king of
the blind men.
TRUE BLUES AT STAMMERSHAM.
THE first stone of the New Bluecoat
Boys School, i.e., Christ's Hospital, was
laid at Stammersham, near Horsham, ten
days ago, by H.R. H', in his capacity as
Grand "Master of Freemasons, with full

about them. By the way, one of the best
and gentlest of all Bluecoat Boys was a
stammerer, namely, CHARLEs LAMB. May
there be many such a sweet and playful
lamb among the future Blues without the
stammer and with no sort of sham about
them, and so, to all masters and pupils
alike in their new abode, Mr. Punch,
endorsing all His Royal Highness said
on the occasion, wishes Happiness and
Prosperity.

Down the Danube.—Early start from Linz. Very scanty

supposes that I also require beer. If not, then wine. Assure
him...that I am only hungry. This is almost too much for his
civility. However, he refrains from any comment, but I see him,
in distant corners, furtively watching the mad Englishman who
is not thirsty at 9.30 A.M. First view of Vienna in the Autumn

only “English spoken here.” Help him to a more correct pro-

Leaves you in all our loves a place apart.

And from your life has sprung for England's throne

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
. ‘God forbid that I should at any time, or under any provoca-
tiºns, have been guilty of so unchristian a thought as to doubt
that a bookseller might be a truly good and honourable man.”
Thus S. T. Coleridge, nearly ninety years ago, wrote to
William Backwoop. Colºniae's capabilities were wide and
profound. , None would claim for him the gift of joking. He
was gravely in earnest when he penned this sentence, which
throws a flood of light upon the relations of literary men and
publishers at the epoch when BYRoN wrote his famous gibe, “Now
BARABBAs was a publisher.” A study of the character of
WILLIAM BLAckwood, presented in Mrs. OLIPHANT's Annals of a
Publishing House (BLAckwood), convicts the literary magnates
of the day of sheer impudence. In his correspondence, and in
every action of his life, “the man clothed in plain apparel” of
the Chaldee Manuscript, stands forth as an amalgam of most
that is good in .# Shrewd of head, kindly of heart, warm in
friendship, magnanimous to an adversary, of sound judgment,
quick insight, liberal in mind and in purse, “the bookseller,” loftily
contemned by the University men of genius in whose favour he
drew cheques, shines among them all with purest, serenest ray.
The two volumes are full of interest, throwing a flood of light
on the history of literature at the beginning of the century.
From that misty land there emerge life-like figures of tumultu-
ous “Christopher North "; of versatile Lockhart, “the scor-
pion which delighteth to sting the faces of men’’; of the poor,
vain “Ettrick Shepherd,” ever in lack of £50; of De QUINCEY in
almost equal need; of “bright, broken MAGINN.”; of others of
that period, and later, whose names are familiar in English litera-
ture. Of these we may read in other books. To my Baronite,
Mrs. OLIPHANT's last work is most precious as making possible
close and intimate acquaintance of the sturdy founder of the
House of BLAckwood, whose personal qualities have happily
proved hereditary.
The Lady's Walk (METHUEN & Co.), by the late Mrs. OL1-
PHANT, is a sweetly pathetic, mystical story. The second tale
in this volume is The Ship's Doctor. Both deeply interesting,
and told with such fascinating simplicity as is the very perfection
of the novelist's art.
St. Ives, by Robert Louis STEvenson (HEINEMANN), does not
give us the author at anything like his best. onlinence-
ment, excellent; afterwards, the interest flags, and only here
and there is attention arrested by a flash of dramatic inci-
dent. Its style suggests that the author had set himself the
task of competing with THACKERAY in Esmond and Barry Lyn-
don. We know, from the prefatorial note, that STEvenson left
the story three-parts finished, and betook himself to other work.
This seems to imply his own dissatisfaction, or, it may have been,
he was overcome by a feeling of weariness, a consequence of his
weak state of health. Here and there he has introduced, in so
careless a manner as to be almost ostentatious, modern slang
phrases, which were, I venture to say, not in vogue during the
first twenty years of the present century. And surely it must have
been only due to carelessness that he should have described two
youths in the house of an elderly matron as “two goºd-lºoking
i. fellows of the other sex.” If they were young “fellows,”
ow on earth could they have been “of the other sex P” Where
the late Mr. STEvenson left off Mr. A. T. QUILLER CRouch has
taken it up and continued it. He finishes it in six chapters, and
so closely has he contrived to imitate his model that, but for the
information conveyed in a note, it would have been uncommonly
difficult to discover where STEvenson ended and CRouch began.
Mr. QUILLER CRouch is possibly unaware that the escape of a

“Because I can't help it. If I don't eat

The White Rabbit led the way to the
kitchen, and opened the door. The
Plumber was leaning against the mantel-

crossed on his bosom, and his gaze was
fixed abstractedly on the ceiling, whilst

seemed to account for the seraphic smile
that played on his countenance. He had
taken up half the flooring, he had taken
down half the wall, he had pulled the grate

about the room.
“There he is!” whispered the White
Rabbit. “He’s stood there for a fort-

get rid of him.”
The poor Rabbit looked so unutterably
miserable, and the Plumber so abominably
self-satisfied, that ALICE felt her indigna-

Plumber, very rudely, as Alice thought.

“I’m not.”
“You are. If you weren't ignorant, you

BlizzARDo ! Blizzardo // BLIZZARDO !!!
It was on all the Hilarity sandwiches. Enigmatic as it might
appear to the common crowd, for one this simple iteration was
pregnant with meaning. That one was ALIELUIA GRouse, seated
at the time in an automatotor, going neither she nor the driver
knew exactly whither. At first she had failed to take it all in.
You know how trying it always is when you come straight out of
the comparative retirement of a nunnery into the whirl and glare
of the Metropolis, with its omnibuses and heady gas-lights. It
was only during one of the vehicle's involuntary pauses that she
began to grasp the purport of the posters. It was her love, her
Luke BlizzARD, the chaste dream of her childhood, who, under
the thin veil of an Italian pseudonym, was to make sport for the
sensual multitude in a music-hall. How changed from the Luke
of those dear, dead days of innocence, when they climbed the
tree of knowledge together, he in flannels, she in a lily jersey
and her own ruby curls!
Suddenly from without, º the Great Horseless Carriage-
window 'º'; the nunnery bull-pup, Sandowski. The faithful
creature had been following her into the wide, wide world on
the petroleum-cistern, from which he had displaced three extra
passengers, eating a small piece of each. Ah! he at least had
not changed; life, then, was not all illusion 1
These meditations were rudely interrupted by a diversion on
the part of the automatotor. The machine had been super-
naturally arrested at the very door of the Hilarity. Gorgeous
equipages were depositing fair women in music-hall cloaks and
satin shoes; also brave men in patent leather and shirt-fronts:
some with three studs, some with two, some with one. A
momentary, doubt assailed her. The pit! Its very name was
associated in her guileless mind with the eventual end of the
ungodly' But curiosity, the fatal passion to know the worst,
overcame her scruples. She .."the vestibule, closely pur-
sued by Sandowski. The portal guardian attempted to oppose
said; and the man retired abashed. The same unstudied tact
garried her past a row of brilliant flunkeys, and easily secured
her a seat in the front row of the pit. The dog, not easily
astonished, curled his lithe form under her feet.
For a time, she forgot her object in the novelty of the scene,
about which the reader, if he has not had the author's advantages,
ought to be told something. An interval was on. Clouds of
rank tobacco-smoke, very distressing to many ladies of the aris-
tocracy, obscured the proscenium; while champagne for the
front seats, and beer for the back, flowed in open conduits down
the radii and diazomata of the auditorium. Sandowski noticed
this, and helped himself. At length the band began to play.
The music had reference to the new performer, not to the one
who had gone off ten minutes before. A lady came on and sang
something about another lady's back-hair, and the place where
it hung. ALLELUIA was inexpressibly shocked. She looked
round at the shameless faces behind her grinning saucily above
their light frock-coats (a popular form of apparel in the pit).
“Such,” she said to herself, “are the º pleasures of our
people. O my country, my country!” Involuntarily she had
lapsed into quotation from a Mr. CAINE, gifted Manx expert, and
widely recommended to the rising generation of Man.
Presently, a new number was put up. In case it is not gene-
rally known that these numbers correspond to those in the pro-
grammes, and are slid into picture-frames on the stage by liveried
minions, let this fact be no longer concealed. Through the roar
of anticipation which shook the Oriental building, ALLELUIA could
detect !. offensively vulgar phrase, “Good old BLIzzARDo!”
She strongly resented this tone of universal proprietorship. Her
feet swam under her as she saw a figure, only too familiar, ad-
vance jauntily to the footlights, which, it should be said,
are placed in the forepart of the stage. Though sadly
marred by a false nose and a “bald comic " she readily recog-
nised the speaking features of her love of the old Manx days.
Nodding to the audience, he began to sing. . Ah! the sweet old
song! How often had she heard him give it in her native isle at
the Sodor and Man diocesan treats! The same massive bari-
tone, the same persuasive delivery, the same irresistible contor-
tions of the face, allowing, of course, for the change of nose;
but, then, how significant that changel how subtly fraught
with sinister import!
The song was a little thing in the original Gaelic, which went
straight to the heart of every Anglo-Saxon in the house. Inno-
cent as were the words (in the original), they suffered severely
from the audience in the process of ignorant translation. The
ungovernable licence of the pit lent to them just any meaning
that appealed to its low, its deplorably, low, taste:, The air was
thick with innuendos; the floor paved with double intentions.
On one of the stoutest slabs stood a philanthropist in a dark
cloak, leering suggestively from under his Babylonish sombrero.
But the saddest thing of all was that the singer seemed to
approve the improper interpretations of the crowd. Twice he
openly winked ; once at the trombone, once at the triangle (a
three-cornered tinkling instrument); and as he took leave of the
audience he had the effrontery to hitch up his trousers at the
knee, only slightly, it is true, but enough to discover a portion
of pea-green sock in a way that was far from delicate. The
effect was instantaneous: it brought down great fragments of
the house. With that brute instinct which is often superior
to the moral intelligence of fallen man, the dog Sandowski
emitted a howl; thus drawing upon himself the attention of
a Member of the Force (in plain clothes), who proceeded to
arrest him for being without a muzzle. In vain a very gallant
neighbour declared that he was its guilty owner; for Sandowski
at once took him in the jaw before being felled to the ground
by a blow from the constable's whistle. And even as LUKE.
Blizzard was coming on for his encore, wearing a wreath of
damask-roses, the gift of an admirer in the stage-box, ALLELUIA
Grouse was being ignominiously passed on from chuckerout to
chuckerout in the wake of her inanimate hound. Her heart
was too full to pay much attention to the philanthropist in the
Babylonish sombrero, who was just then hovering round the
pit-door, taking notes for his new work, If Mr. Stead went

this rash owner of collieries to drag out the remaining years of
his miserable life?. Has Mr. Jessi, CoLLINGs yet selected for
him the special varieties of bread and water on which he is to

the JEsse Collingses we deserve. But no other Jesse Collings
that I have met ever displayed a faith so sincere, or a devotion
so touching as that which your bland and imperturbable adorer
lavishes upon you. Why should we vex our minds with musty
memories of DAMon and PYTHIAs, or HARModrus and ARIsToGI-
ToN ? To me, I declare, the Joseph and JEsse of the present
day are worth more in their happy alliteration than all the in-
ferior twin-friends of past ages.
So there are compensations—of a sort. And on the whole you
have had a fairly successful year, not sufficiently brilliant, of
course, to warrant you in imitating Polycrates by casting some
treasured object—JEssº, it, may be—into the sea, but quite
reasonably successful for all that. Not for nothing did the
Colonial Premiers visit our jubilating shores. Careless observers
might suppose that they were here to do honour to the QUEEN,
to prove by their presence the vastness and the freedom of hei
Empire. I (and you) knew better. It was to swell your triumph, my
dear Joseph, that they turned their course to England, and it
may be added that they and the world at large were not allowed
to forget the object of their visit. Did the intoxication (I speak

fully-devised eulogies that these unsuspecting Statesmen lavished
upon you cause you to forget for a moment that rugged old
Boer President who, whatever else may be said against him
proved himself more than a match for the dapper cocksure chief
of our Colonial Office? Was there not a brand-new patent
scheme of Home Rule for the Rand which burst upon a puzzled
public after the Jameson Raid? Where is it now P And that
polite but prematurely-published invitation to Mr. KRUGER
what has become of it, and when, oh, when, is it to be accepted?
And there are still rude and prying ruffians who want to know
about a batch of telegrams, and go about declaring that you are
far too clever and cunning to have been so ignorant and so inno-
cent as you wish to be believed. Of your declaration as to what
a public man may do, and yet maintain his honour unscathed,
the less said the better. Not often has the House of Commons
listened to so amazing a discourse on the ethical value of deceit,
intrigue and evasion.
Well, well, there are flies in every politician's pot of ointment,
and it is fair to remember that, owing chiefly to your own care,
the pot you possess is not a small one, and your ointment is of
the very best. But be warned, my dear Joseph, be warned. It
is not much, of course, to have an attractive and amiable person-
ality. Many men have that who will never make a stir in the
world. And to be modest or courteous will not secure immortal
fame. But a trace here and there of amiability, of modesty, of
courtesy to opponents, might possibly be useful. After all, you
did not invent the British Empire, and some of us had heard of
the Colonies before you became their Secretary of State.

Yours respectfully, THE WAGRANT.
NEW LAMPS FOR OLD.
IN reviewing a recently-published collection of “Nursery
Rhymes,” a daily paper remarks that “such productions as these
must surely have had their day,” and points out that modern
children cannot be expected to find pleasure in such “barbarous
jingles.” While recognising the force of this criticism, Mr.
unch feels that it would be a pity if these old stories were
entirely forgotten, and he therefore recommends their re-publica-
tion in a style more in accord with the literary tastes of the day.
The following tale may serve as an example of what the nursery-
story should be when re-written for youthful decadents. It is
entitled:
NOCTURNE IN BLACK-AND-BLUE.
The subtle colour-harmony was fading from the Western sky,
and JACK awoke from his reverie, the material prose of this
squalid world resurging strongly in his inmost soul. “Pah,” he
exclaimed to his fair companion. “How vain is all our life! A
few golden hours have we snatched, my JILL; all this afternoon
have we been dead to the world—dead to ourselves—free from the
thrall of the insistent present. Forgetting to analyse this com-
plex transcendent Ego that lures us to despair, we have enjoyed
a sensuous, pagan, objective interlude. In fact, we have made
dear, .#. mud-pies. And, as a consequence, my hands are
not clean, and you, my JILL, have a large lump of mud on your
nose. Let us”—he shivered slightly—“return to the house, to
the sordid environment of the Philistines, and let us wash.”
JILL clasped her hands, and her voice trembled with passion as
she replied, “Oh, not in the house, JACK, not in the house ! Its
atmosphere chokes me—stifles me. Let us rather ascend to the
hill-top, the hill-top sweet with the fresh fragrance of the breeze,
and let us thence bring down the necessary pail of water!”
JACK's eyes were moist with tears.
“JILL, forgive me. You are right—you are always right. Yes
we will climb together—always together. See, I will hold you
tightly by the scruff of your neck—thus—and run you up in no
time. Nay, do not kick my shin. To the hill-top, where, per-
chance, we shall find Mr. GRANT ALLEN and his company of
heroines—to the hill-top, where the pure fountain of translucent
water bubbles forth. Are you ready? Go!”
And with a loud scream Jack pushed the struggling JILL towards
the slope, where they vanished in the twilight. Ever thus should
it be, man and woman, boy and girl, climbing the hill of Fate
together!
- - - - -
Two shrieks ring through the startled air.
“Hold tight, you silly fool!”
“JACK, I’m falling! I’m falling!”
A crash; two sickening bumps on the hard ground, and silence.

PLEASANTLY chatty, interesting, and amusing, are Mr. Fitz-
GERALD MoLLoy's two volumes, entitled, The Romance of the
Irish Stage. Mr. MoLLoy reminds us of many old stories,
and as good old friends, they are most welcome, especially
as he appropriately fits them up with well-known names, and
cleverly localises them. But of all reminiscences, those concern-
ing PEG WoffingtoN (whose biographer some little time ago was
Mr. Molloy) are the most interesting, though occupying but a
small space in the two volumes. Hard drinking, ready fighting,
horse-play, reckless gambling, and a general happy-go-luckiness

[The other day, Dr. LechER spoke in the Austrian Reichsrath for 12 hours.]
O WILHELM, by no means the Silent, look out,

A speech of twelve hours, a record, no doubt,

Or else his lèse-majesté soon would efface
A traitor who rivalled his sovereign's “jaw.”

With suitable training you're better than he,
And able to have—fitting phrase—the last word.

And practise with all the professors of jaw;
We also have people with too much to say,
Connected with politics, mostly, or law.
Talk with them incessantly, morning and night,
Talk sense or talk nonsense, talk slowly or fast;
Such excellent training will make you all right,
Your jaw will be stronger than LECHER's at last.
Then challenge your rival to combat of tongues,
For twenty-four hours hold forth, might and main;
You'll beat him in spite of his powerful lungs,
And you’ll be the Champion Speaker again.

ON the cover, a maiden in a sad violet-coloured gown, trying
to catch a wild deluge of green shamrocks, is no surprising pre-
paration for a story of the “distressful counthry.” This figure on
the outside is transformed inside to A Daughter of Erin, by
Violet FINNY. It is a romantic tale of a family “of no import-
ance,” except that they possess a banshee—the one great hall-
mark of genuine Celtic respectability, and without which no
house is considered complete. (BLACKIE & SoN.)

(Leadenhall Press), gives the start and decline of the handy form
of primer from which our forefathers learnt their A B C,
in the days when education was not a matter of compulsion.
According to learned research, the Horn Book occasionally
served other purposes, such as a battledore or even bat; whilst
it became a seductive instrument in a teacher's hand wherewith
to impress its contents on some hard-headed youth. Its subtle
handiness was not at such moments highly appreciated by the
pupil. With graceful allusion to Mr. Punch's advice on a former
occasion, the author has inserted two or three specimens of the
Horn Book in a pocket at the end of the book. at the names
of LINLEY SAMBourne, PHIL MAY, PERCY MAcquorp, Miss MAUDE

Mr. J. HUNTLY McCARTHY has added two volumes to his story
of The French Revolution (CHATTo AND WINDUs). The under-
taking of such a task in view of the imposing array of standard
works on the subject indicates a bold spirit. With all its proved
inaccuracy, CARLYLE's French Revolution still fills the bills.
Mr. McCARTHY, though not quite so picturesque in style, is safer
than the Sage on matters of fact, Reading between the lines
of his work, it is easy to see that he has spared no pains in the
way of consulting authorities. As the last gleaner in a well-
swept field, he has the advantage of profiting by the labours
of those who have gone before him since CARLYLE brought out
his brimful basket. His literary art is equal to the most exacting
demands.

“Crouch.” Very hospitable of the Baron to give him a liquid,
and here's Mr. QUILLER Couch's health ! But how much better
to be “CRouch’” than “Couch,” as the latter name implies an

political parties, ºf:g them, as did the heathen philoso-
pher of old, “all equally right or all equally wrong,” a work of
absorbing interest. These three volumes are a most valuable
contribution to the political history of our time. The illustra-

though what connection there is between Klondyke and a “Hunt
Breakfast” as represented in the large coloured picture where
those indispensable members of a hunt, namely, foxes, male and
female, are all enjoying themselves together, it is at first sight
not a little difficult to say. Perhaps these sly foxes are discussing
whether it wouldn't be better to be off to Klondyke before the
Winter is over, the discussion having been started by the Star
of Klondyke, the title of Mr. LATEy's Christmas Number afore-
said, now brought under their notice. Artists and authors have

THE REMOTE NIGHT-GOWN.

for British Central Africa,” says, anent night-
owns, “I believe these indecent monstrosities
inger in remote parts of England, but they have
;"; since been banished from the life of Europeans
in the Tropics.”]
WHEN condemning our night-gowns,
And calling them fright gowns,
Sir H. makes a grave accusation;
For these very same white gowns,
Although they are light gowns,
Do not merit his hard imputation,

By any known African nation.

Such as England—they vote
For this monstrous “undressification,”
And from England, let's say, to Bombay
or Bahamas,

THE BITTER CRY OF THE ESQUIRES.
IN pursuance of the address which was
communicated on November 12 to the
Baronets of England, Ireland, Scotland,
Great Britain and the United Kingdom,
by an influential committee of , that
Honourable Order, it is understood that a
circular is being drawn up to the following
effect by the long-suffering and down-
trodden holders of the ancient, but now
misused, title of “Esquire”: –
We, the members of “The Senior Com-
mittee of the Estimable Order of Esquires,”
being of opinion that an occasion has now
arrived when suitable preliminary steps
may be taken with a view to establish and
maintain the privileges of the Order, do
invite as many other esquires as possible
to join in the aims as here summarised,
for example:–
1. To revive the Royal Warrant of the
date April 1, 13th Queen ANNE, in so far
as it is ordained that esquires on succeed-
ing to their title should establish their
descent from some sort of an ancestor, so
as gradually to eliminate the parvenus, the
nouveauz riches, the organ-grinders, cab-
runners and potato-can-men, soi-disant
esquires, from further official recognition.
To vary the recent precedency order
so as to apply only to esquires who are
unable to pay their week's rent, or have
lately served a term of penal servitude:
To revive the use of the ancient style of
“estimable” or “respectable.”
3. To assign to the Esquirage like other
orders below the peerage, with habit and
insignia, that is, coat, collar, and cuffs,
the last-named having been provided (at
the expense of grammatical training) on
credit at any of the Universities through-
out the Kingdom.
4. That on the death of each esquire his
insignia be returned by his executors to
the washerwoman and the dustnan respec-
tively (as is the case with the Orders of
Gents, Misters and Commercial Travellers),
to be returned to the next esquire on satis-
factorily proving his need of the same.
5. That the relative precedence of the
Estimable Order among foreign croupiers
and chevaliers d’industrie should be autho-
ritatively defined.
6. That those esquires whose patents
contain the clause by which their eldest
sons are entitled to #. style of “Mister”
on attaining their majority, should send

You 'LL GU-GU-GET
THERE QUICKER TH-TH-TH-THAN I CAN T-T-T-TELL You !”
The primary essential for the success of
this movement is an overpowering number
of supporters, and it will materially stiffen
the backs of the committee if esquires will
kindly append their mark to the enclosed
form, approving our aims, and becoming,
nominally at least, one of our supporters,
for fortune favours the big battalions, all
things, we mean, all other things, being
equal. Indeed, it cannot be too clearly
nor too often reverberated, that unless the
greater majority of prehistoric esquires are
agreed as to our aims and methods, we
shall continue to be ranked at dinner-tables
after the sons of legal life peers, and our
efforts may be regarded as foredoomed to
failure, and we shall be thankful to know
whether the order as a whole is sympa-
thetic, apathetic, or paralytic.

trodden holders of the ancient, but now
misused, title of “Esquire”: –
We, the members of “The Senior Com-
mittee of the Estimable Order of Esquires,”
being of opinion that an occasion has now
arrived when suitable preliminary steps
may be taken with a view to establish and
maintain the privileges of the Order, do
invite as many other esquires as possible
to join in the aims as here summarised,
for example:–
1. To revive the Royal Warrant of the
date April 1, 13th Queen ANNE, in so far
as it is ordained that esquires on succeed-
ing to their title should establish their
descent from some sort of an ancestor, so
as gradually to eliminate the parvenus, the
nouveauz riches, the organ-grinders, cab-
runners and potato-can-men, soi-disant
esquires, from further official recognition.
2. To vary the recent precedency order
so as to apply only to esquires who are
unable to pay their week's rent, or have
lately served a term of penal servitude:
To revive the use of the ancient style of
“estimable” or “respectable.”
3. To assign to the Esquirage like other
orders below the peerage, with habit and
insignia, that is, coat, collar, and cuffs,
the last-named having been provided (at
the expense of grammatical training) on
credit at any of the Universities through-
out the Kingdom.
4. That on the death of each esquire his
insignia be returned by his executors to
the washerwoman and the dustnan respec-
tively (as is the case with the Orders of
Gents, Misters and Commercial Travellers),
to be returned to the next esquire on satis-
factorily proving his need of the same.
5. That the relative precedence of the
Estimable Order among foreign croupiers
and chevaliers d’industrie should be autho-
ritatively defined.
6. That those esquires whose patents
contain the clause by which their eldest
sons are entitled to the style of “Mister”
on attaining their majority, should send

MR. J. M. BARRIE (Novelist and Dramatic Author).
“Ech, SIRs 1 ‘WHAUR's Your WULLIE SHAkspeaRE Noo?'"
THE linguistic “deefeecultees” (if Little Minister BARRIE will
pardon my attempt at phonetic spelling of Scotch “as” I think
...she is spoken”) that faced me within the first few pages of
The Little Minister (wasn't it called “The Stickit Minister,” or is
that another divine in another ministry?) were so obstacular, that
no amount of my own particular supply of perseverance, within a
limited period, was sufficient to surmount, them. Had I been a
literary “Death or Glory Boy,” I would have charged again,
would have broken down the Barrie-cade, overtopped the “deefee-
cultees” or perished in the attempt. But it was not so to be, and
hence it happens that my thorough acquaintance with the story
and c ers of Mr. J. M. BARRIE’s Scotch novel has been made
through the medium of his play at the Haymarket. The plot is
fresh, ingenious, and dramatic; it is lucidly told by the dramatist
and, every one of the dramatis personae being a distinctly marked
character, it is admirably acted by all concerned in the representa-
tion. If ever dramatic author had reason to be thoroughly satis-
fied with his interpreters it is Mr. BARRIE. Mr. FREDERICK
HARRison and Mr. CYRIL MAUDE may well congratulate them-
selves, and certainly deserve the congratulations of all play-goers
on the wisdom of their selection. Thank goodness that Mr.
BRANDoN THoMAs, Mr. MARK KINGHoRNE, Mr. TYLER, Mr.
Holman CLARK, and Mr. SYDNEY., WALENTINE–all excellent—
only very occasionally speak such Scotch as is unintelligible to
the unaccustomed ear of the McCockNEy. The thanks of the
ublic, on this score are equally due to Mrs. E. H. BRookE and
iss MARY MACKENZIE, both of whom favour the public with
just so much of the strong Scotch, as suffices to show how unin-
telligible they could be # they chose. Mr. CYRIL MAUDE has
been wisely advised (by himself) in not making any attempt at
a broad accent which might have rendered the charming love
passages between the captivated Little Minister and the eccentric
daughter of the Earl of Rintoul so hopelessly ridiculous that their
marriage would have excited the deepest sympathy of the audience
luckless Desdemona who married the Moor-not.up in Scotland),
and the greatest pity for the honest, plucky Little Minister, in
whose future as the husband of such an eccentrie, volatile, and
tricky little person as Lady Babbie would be laid up a store of
misery, ending in sensational scandal and divorce. .The
character of the Reverend Gavin Dishart, who at the end of the
"|third act might well have changed his name to “Give-in-Dis-
hartened” but for the blundering malice of Captain Halliwell,
(not a pleasant type of English officer, well-played by Mr. HAL-
LARD,) is perfectly rendered by Mr. CYRIL MAUDE, artistically
made up as the youthful Presbyterian clergyman. -
Mrs. CYRIL MAUDE, still appearing in the bill under her maiden
name of Miss WINIFRED EMERY, has found in Lady Babbie a part
to which, as a true comedian, she can do full justice. That Ladu
Babbie is irritating to a degree no one can fail to admit, and
that the aristocratically-nosed Earl, her father, played with
Wellingtonian abruptness by Mr. W. G. Elliot, would be
justified in somehow punishing her severely, must be felt by every
self-respecting paterfamilias visiting the theatre; and yet thus
“Babbie,” in spite of her Carmen-like manner when she throws
the rose at “the Reverend gent,” just as the Spanish Gipsy-girl
threw the flower at the captivated Don José and then ran away,
and in spite of her silliness, her giggling, her making fun of
*: º: and tricking her father, is irritatingly lovable—and
whi le.
#". act is the best of four good ones, and the very last
situation on which the curtain descends is quite sufficient to
dismiss an audience thoroughly pleased with everything and
everybody—for they stop to encore the final tableau, over and
over again, so humorous and so full of surprise is it, and to
insure the complete success of The Little Minister.
In the bill it is stated that Sir ALEXANDER MACKENzie has
specially written music for the piece. It may be so, of course it
is so, since it is so announced, but for my part, I got no “special
Scotch” in the way of music during the entertainment, for when
the actors were not speaking the audience were, and conversation
being loud and general during the entr’actes, while a considerable
number were availing themselves of this “ten minutes allowed for
refreshment " to visit the smoking-room, it seemed to me that,
“but for the look of the thing” in the programme, a few Scotch
tunes, and occasionally an ordinary “melo,” would have been
uite sufficient to have met the musical requirements of the play.
owever, thank goodness, there are no bagpipes. Probably Sir
ALExANDER's “special Scotch” compositions will soon be heard,
and then appreciated at a McCLASSICAL concert.

MY DEAR SIR,-Your modesty will perhaps pardon me if I
begin by stating that I consider it a privilege to write to you.
We both follow the profession of literature, both of us know
what it is not to spare the peritura charta, both understand by
what hieroglyphic marks the mistakes in proof-sheets may be
corrected, and both of us, I suppose, receive with due gratitude
the honorarium to which our labours entitle us. But there the
resemblance ends. You have fought your way up to the magic
Castle of Romance, you have struck the shield that hangs upon
the outer wall, and have blown a loud, clear blast upon the
mighty horn. I– But why should I speak of myself? All I
need do is to tell you again that I am proud to have the chance
of talking to you for a few moments on paper.
Many are the pleasant hours I have spent with the men you
have created, men with deep chests and broad backs and untiring
limbs and dauntless courage. That is the company. (White or
otherwise) that I like. I can step into the street at this moment
and see hundreds of the spindle-shanked and pigeon-breasted in
their top-hats and black coats and dingy trousers—all very
worthy, very respectable, and perfectly punctual. They pay
their rates, and eat their roast mutton, and support tº:
families; they catch their morning trains, and crackle the topics
of the day with one another as they fare city-wards, but when I
say that for interest they cannot vie with Micah Clarke and
Hordle John, or many another of the stout and valiant fellows
whose honest, swashing blows resound in your stories, that
Sherlock Holmes, too (never an arch favourite of mine—but let
that pass), outweighs them all—when I say this I am stating a
truth mildly and, fº. without offence. And as for problem
novels, analytical novels, sex-novels, and all the rest of the
Gadarene class, I fancy we have got through any craze we may
have had for them. Have we not all problems enough of our own
without resorting to novels? How shall we fashion our lives,
even in such small matters as the daily arrangement of dinners,
or the ordering of new clothes, or the making and keeping of
friends, or the acquisition in marriage of the beloved one *
These matters are, in all conscience, perplexing enough for us.
And as for sex-novels, great Heaven, we may be degenerate and
anaemic, but most of us have not yet sunk so low as to bother our
heads about the stale questions that occupy the minds of the
epicene purveyors of dirt and balderdash. No, penned in as we
are by convention and circumstance, we sigh for the lusty and re-
joicing manhood of past ages. We commit ourselves to you, and
we are with the White Company in their last glorious stand, we
hear the trumpets sound and the clamorous battle-cries re-echo
from host to host, the arrows hurtle through the air, the great
swords rise and gleam and fall, and the tide of conflict rolls back-
ward and forward till the night descends. And then—why, then
we come back with fresher hearts to the dull routine of our in-
glorious lives. And it may chance, too, that after such a com-
panionship with you we shall feel our breasts thrill with a higher
emotion and a more generous admiration when we hear of the
deeds that our fellow-subjects are even now performing far away
amid the crags and precipices of the Indian frontier.
But softly, good friend—it is a carper who speaks—softly: all
that Mr. Doyle does has been done before. Scott has done it,
DUMAs has done it. Granted, I answer; but what then P Scott,
whom we love, and DUMAs, whom we love, need not exclude a
later affection for you. I make no comparisons; I have before my
eyes the fear of Mr. CHRISTIE MURRAY ; nor, in any case, is it
necessary either to exclude or to include a modern by comparing
him with the ancient masters. Let a man stand on his own
sturdy legs and be judged. Thus I place you, and salute and
thank you. And, I may add, that not so long ago I took from
the shelf Le Bâtard de Mauléon, by DUMAs, and read it with a
breathless interest. The period is that of your White Com-
pany, and there is magnificent fighting in it, but the mail-clad
warriors fight on the side opposed to yours, and Bertrand du
Guesclin is their hero. But my enjoyment of the Bertrand of
DUMAs did not in the least impair my delight in your Black Prince
and all the rest of your Hampshire heroes. Why should it not
be so with all of ...} Why should we read Scott or DUMAs, and
say, “We end there; no other and later romancer shall ever
give us pleasure”?
Farewell, Sir. You are yourself a strong, broad-shouldered
man, and you take a natural delight in deeds of strength and
courage. Soon, I cannot doubt, you will array yourself in
armour and gird on your sword again. Are there not vast regions
open to you where adventures may be had for the asking?, Pro-
ceed and conquer them, and lay your spoils once more before
your faithful readers. Affectionately yours, THE WAGRANT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HAGGIS AT THE HAYMARKET.
MR. J. M. BARRIE (Novelist and Dramatic Author).
“Ech, SIRs 1 ‘WHAUR's Your WULLIE SHAkspeaRE Noo?’”
The linguistic “deefeecultees” (if Little Minister BARRIE will
Edon my attempt at phonetic spelling of Scotch “as” I think
...she is spoken”) that faced me within the first few pages of
The Little Minister (wasn't it called “The Stickit Minister,” or is
that another divine in another ministry P) were so obstacular, that
mo amount of my own particular supply of perseverance, within a
limited period, was sufficient to surmount them. Had I been a
literary “Death or Glory Boy,” I would have charged again,
would have broken down the Barrie-cade, overtopped the “deefee.
çultees” or perished in the attempt. But it was not so to be, and
hence it happens that my thorough acquaintance with the story
and characters of Mr. J. M. BARRIE’s Scotch novel has been made
through the medium of his play at the Haymarket. The plot is
fresh, ingenious, and dramatic; it is lucidly told by the dramatist
and, every one of the dramatis personae being a distinctly marked
character, it is admirably acted by all concerned in the representa-
tion. If ever dramatic author had reason to be thoroughly satis-
fied with his interpreters it is Mr. BARRIE. Mr. FREDERick
HARRison, and Mr. CYRIL MAUDE may well congratulate them-
selves, and certainly deserve the congratulations of all play-goers
on the wisdom of their selection. Thank goodness that Mr.
BRANDoN Thomas, Mr. MARK KINGHoRNE, Mr. Tyler, Mr.
HQLMAN CLARK, and Mr. SYDNEY_WALENTINE–all excellent-
only very occasionally speak such Scotch as is unintelligible to
the unaccustomed ear of the McCockNEy. The thanks of the
º on this score are equally due to Mrs. E. H. Brooke and
Miss Mary, MACKENzie, both of whom favour the public with
just $9.much of the strong Scotch as suffices to show how unin-
telligible they, could be if they chose. Mr. Cyril Maude has
been wisely advised (by himself) in not making an attempt at
a broad accent which might have rendered the º: love
passages between the captivated Little Minister and the eccentric
daughter of the Earl of Rintoul so hopelessly ridiculous that their
marriage would have excited the deepest sympathy of the audience
luckless Desdemona who married the Moor—not up in Scotland),
and the greatest pity for the honest, plucky Little Minister, in
whose future as #. husband of such an eccentric, volatile, and
tricky little person as Lady Babbie would be laid up a store of
misery, ending in sensational scandal and divorce. The
character of the Reverend Gavin Dishart, who at the end of the
third act might well have changed his name to “Give-in-Dis-
hartened” but for the blundering malice of Captain Halliwell,
(not a pleasant type of English officer, well-played by Mr. HAL-
LARD,) is perfectly rendered by Mr. CYRIL MAUDE, artistically
made up as the youthful Presbyterian clergyman.
Mrs. CYRIL MAUDE, still appearing in the bill under her maiden
name of Miss WINIFRED EMERY, has found in Lady Babbie a part
to which, as a true comedian, she can do full justice. That Lady
Babbie is irritating to a degree no one can fail to admit, and
that the aristocratically-nosed Earl, her father, played with
Wellingtonian abruptness by Mr. W. G. ELLIOT, would be
justified in somehow punishing her severely, must be felt by every
self-respecting paterfamilias visiting the theatre; and yet this
“Babbie,” in spite of her Carmen-like manner when she throws
the rose at “the Reverend gent,” just as the Spanish Gipsy-girl
threw the flower at the captivated Don José and then ran away,
and in spite of her silliness, her giggling, her making fun of
; º: and tricking her father, is irritatingly lovable—and
whippable.
#. last act is the best of four good ones, and the very last
situation on which the curtain descends is quite sufficient to
dismiss an audience thoroughly pleased with everything and
everybody—for they stop to encore the final tableau, over and
over again, so humorous and so full of surprise is it, and to
insure the complete success of The Little Minister.
In the bill it is stated that Sir ALEXANDER MACKENZIE has
specially written music for the piece. It may be so, of course it
is so, since it is so announced, but for my part, I got no “special
Scotch” in the way of music during the entertainment, for when
the actors were not speaking the audience were, and conversation
being loud and general during the entr’actes, while a considerable
number were availing themselves of this “ten minutes allowed for
refreshment " to visit the smoking-room, it seemed to me that,
“but for the look of the thing” in the programme, a few Scotch
tunes, and occasionally an ordinary “melo,” would have been
uite sufficient to have met the musical requirements of the play.
owever, thank goodness, there are no bagpipes. Probably Sir
ALEXANDER's “special Scotch” compositions will soon be heard,
and then appreciated at a McCLASSICAL concert.
TO GUARDIANS.
[“The Holbeach (Lincolnshire). Guaruians have received a letter from the
Local Government Board asking what number of currants were to be put in
the children's puddings. lt seems tuat the intoruation was wanted for audit
purposes. The master of the workhouse is to provide a reply to tue communi-
cation.”—Westminster Gazette.]
IN view of the above it is obvious that guardians in the future
will be expected to possess certain qualifications that have not been
required of them in the past. We are informed on high authority
that intending candidates will be subjected to a ing ex-
amination before they are allowed to offer themselves at the poll.
The following questions have been forwarded to us as a specimen
paper, the numbers in brackets indicating the value attached
to a correct answer to each.
1. How would you test for adipose tissue in a Holbeach pauper?
How would you proceed if you found any traces of it? [10]
2. Analyse your emotions after consuming a workhouse dinner.
Describe the preparation known as “bread and scrape,” and
estimate in millionths of a millimetre the thickness of the
butter. [10]
3. There are a old women in a ward A. There are y tea-leaves
in half a pound of tea. There are z gallons of H.O in the copper.
Solve the mixed equation
[yxz H.O (lukewarm)]+1 oz. condensed milk
QC = 1 pint pig-wash.
~ pint Pig [10]
4. Twenty-four bilious paupers are fed on plum duff. Twenty-
four deaths take place .#. twenty-four hours. The local
ress (Radical) argues that the latter are the direct result of the
ormer. Is this a case of the fallacy post hoc ergo propter hocł
If not, why not? [10]
5. “Nature abhors a vacuum.” What inference would you
draw from this as to Nature's attitude towards (a) a Guardian's
skull, and (b) a *...* stomach? [10]
6. Solve the problem proposed by the Holbeach Local Govern-

for the father (as cruelly deceived as was ever old Brabanțio by
ment Board as quoted at the head of this paper. [50]

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
No. III.--To M.R. A. ConAN Doyle.
MY DEAR SIR,-Your modesty will perhaps pardon me if I
begin by stating that I consider it a privilege to write to you.
We both follow the profession of literature, both of us know
what it is not to spare the peritura charta, both understand by
what hieroglyphic marks the mistakes in proof-sheets may be
corrected, and both of us, I suppose, receive with due gratitude
the honorarium to which our labours entitle us. But there the
resemblance ends. You have fought your way up to the magic
Castle of Romance, you have struck the shield that hangs upon
the outer wall, and have blown a loud, clear blast upon the
mighty horn. I- But why should I speak of myself? All I
need do is to tell you again that I am proud to have the chance
of talking to you for a few moments on paper.
Many are the pleasant hours I have spent with the men you
have created, men with deep chests and broad backs and untiring
limbs and dauntless courage. That is the company. (White or
otherwise) that I like. I can step into the street at this moment
and see hundreds of the spindle-shanked and pigeon-breasted in
their top-hats and black coats and dingy trousers—all very
worthy, very respectable, and perfectly punctual. They pay
their rates, and eat their roast mutton, and support tº:
families; they catch their morning trains, and crackle the topics
of the day with one another as they fare city-wards, but when I
say that for interest they cannot vie with Micah Clarke and
Hordle John, or many another of the stout and valiant fellows
whose honest, swashing blows resound in your stories, that
Sherlock Holmes, too (never an arch favourite of mine—but let
that pass), outweighs them all—when I say this I am stating a
truth mildly and, I trust, without offence. And as for problem
novels, analytical novels, sex-novels, and all the rest of the
Gadarene class, I fancy we have got through any craze we may
have had for them. Have we not all problems enough of our own
without resorting to novels? How shall we fashion our lives,
even in such small matters as the daily arrangement of dinners
or the ordering of new clothes, or the making and keeping of
friends, or the acquisition in marriage of the beloved one P
These matters are, in all conscience, perplexing enough for us.
And as for sex-novels, great Heaven, we may be degenerate and
anaemic, but most of us have not yet sunk so low as to bother our
heads about the stale questions that occupy the minds of the
epicene purveyors of dirt and balderdash. No, penned in as we
are by convention and circumstance, we sigh for the lusty and re-
joicing manhood of past ages. We commit ourselves to you, and
we are with the White Company in their last glorious stand, we
hear the trumpets sound and the clamorous battle-cries re-echo
from host to host, the arrows hurtle through the air, the great
swords rise and gleam and fall, and the tide of conflict rolls back-
ward and forward till the night descends. And then—why, then
we come back with fresher hearts to the dull routine of our in-
glorious lives. And it may chance, too, that after such a com-
panionship with you we shall feel our breasts thrill with a higher
emotion and a more generous admiration when we hear of the
deeds that our fellow-subjects are even now performing far away
amid the crags and precipices of the Indian frontier.
But softly, good friend—it is a carper who speaks—softly: all
that Mr. Doyle does has been done before. Scott has done it,
DUMAs has done it. Granted, I answer; but what then P Scott,
whom we love, and DuMAs, whom we love, need not exclude a
later affection for you. I make no comparisons; I have before my
eyes the fear of Mr. CHRISTIE MURRAY ; nor, in any case, is it
necessary either to exclude or to include a modern by comparing
him with the ancient masters. Let a man stand on his own
sturdy legs and be judged. Thus I place you, and salute and
thank you. And, I may add, that not so long ago I took from
the shelf Le Bâtard de Mauléon, by DUMAs, and read it with a
breathless interest. The period is that of your White Com-
pany, and there is magnificent fighting in it, but the mail-clad
warriors fight on the side opposed to yours, and Bertrand du
Guesclin is their hero. But my enjoyment of the Bertrand of
DUMAs did not in the least impair my delight in your Black Prince
and all the rest of your Hampshire heroes. Why should it not
be so with all of us? Why should we read Scott or DUMAs, and
say, “We end there; no other and later romancer shall ever
give us pleasure”?
Farewell, Sir. You are yourself a strong, broad-shouldered
man, and you take a natural delight in deeds of strength and
courage. Soon, I cannot doubt, you will array yourself in
armour and gird on your sword again. Are there not vast regions
open to you where adventures may be had for the asking? Pro-
ceed and conquer them, and lay your spoils once more before
your faithful readers. Affectionately yours, THE WAGRANT.
“BRIGHT CHANTICLEER.”—During the speech of Mr. Cock,
Q.C., in the recent “Medical Divorce Case,” a juryman fell fast
asleep. At the sound of the voice of “the Herald of the Dawn,”
it is popularly supposed that the sleeper is awakened. Perhaps
the case of the sleeping juryman insensible to the notes of the
Cock, chaunt he never so wisely, is the exception that proves the
rule. In future, Mr. Cock, Q.C. will not be “too cocky” as to

SCHOOL-BOARD ELECTION, 1897.
GENTLEMEN,+I beg to offer myself as a candidate for election
to the London School Board. It would be my first endeavour,
if elected, to raise the rate. The British public evidently likes
School-Board extravagance, so why should it not be humoured P
I should give constant attention to the enforcement of regular
attendance at schools, the wholesale fining of parents, and above
all, of the teaching of useful subjects, such as playing the har-
monium, geometrical drawing, the study of the articulated skele-
ton, the Greek and Hebrew languages in all their various
ramifications, learning Sanscrit, and writing essays on the Morse
code of signals. The art of golfing would also occupy a con-
siderable portion of the scholars' time (clubs, balls, and links,
together with a reasonable number of caddies, to be provided at
the expense of the ratepayers).
The special schools for children of defective intellect, deserves
and would receive at my hands, every encouragement. I should
propose to supply the inmates of all such schools with a liberal
amount of the modern “hill-top” novels, together with the
recent lucubrations of several of our most distinguished minor
poets.
The schools for the deaf and dumb should each be provided
with a German band. If the efforts of all itinerant Teutonic
musicians were confined to these institutes, none of the rest of
the public need carry guns. -
#. cookery and laundry classes cannot be of the *::: use,
nowadays, and I should vote for their abolition and the sub-
stitution of a bicycling class in their place (bicycles, fitted with
pneumatic tyres, to be provided at the expense of the ratepayers).
It would, in my opinion, be disastrous to introduce Sectarian
teaching into the Board Schools. Much better to give the
children lessons in scorching, and how to dodge the Bobby when
observed.
I should always oppose the introduction of a birch or any other
instrument of correction in any Board School. The punishment
inflicted by such implements is all very well in such schools as
Eton and Rugby, but would at once become degrading in a Board
School, where none but the most refined and sensitive of children
are found.

[A certain wºekly paper is said to have established a British Equivalent fo

Man, 1897.
DEAR MR. Punch,-Your attention may have been directed to
a recent epoch-making announcement in the pages of The School-
master at Home. ...The staff of that leading organ of criticism has
decided to establish a Ménagerie Littéraire. Already it has
tentatively published a list of the Greatest Forty. Once a year
it, threatens to select a work, of signal merit and crown, it
(Fr. couronner) with a Triple-Expansion Grand Piano. It has
further arranged for the coronation of a book by some young
aspirant. The tiara in this case will take the shape of a Small
Cottage Street-organ. It is felt that this munificent offer will
furnish a noble source of sustinence to the starving hero of the
year; and, apart from the grosser incentive, will encourage even
the Greatest writers to become, if possible, Greater Still.
But, weighty as must always be the authority of such a journal
as The Schoolmaster at Home, I can hardly doubt but that some
of The Rejected will appeal against its verdict to your sympa-
thetic and erudite judgment. My many friends (including notori-
ous pulpit-orators) have urged me, much against the instincts
of modesty, to write to you on my own claims. I am emboldened
to take upon me this uncongenial task by the kindly appreciation
you have already extended to my latest masterpiece, The Heathen.

“JEMiMA,” he said, “you annoy me—you annoy me excessively.
when iſ fain would pen the last stanza of this priceless Ballade
of Bath Buns you interrupt me with a Philistine request to “play
soldiers.” Child, I begin to despair of you. You are eight years
old—but twelve months younger than myself—and you are dead,

JEMIMA, I crave for solitude—I would commune with my own
deep thoughts, and probe the mystery of the inmost soul. And
so, having wiped my fingers—which I perceive to be stained with
the ink of authorship—in your hair (I beseech you, spare me
those inharmonious wailings!), I will now seat myself in yonder
corner, secluded as far as may be from the debasing horrors of
the nursery furniture.”
He moved towards the corner, but paused for awhile at the
table. “Ah, what have we here?” he murmured. “Yes, it is
one of those quaint relics of an effete superstition—it is, in fact,
what they call ‘a Christmas pie.” Yes, this strange emblem of
the benighted past shall accompany me to my corner. 'Twill
furnish food for both mind and body. Dear pie, let us wend

That is my pie!”, cried his sister, angrily.
He turned towards her, and with inimitable grace laid his

wards the girl.

'twas once yours matters not; rest content to know that at least
'tis mine now. We have done with the bad old modes of thought,
we have done with ignorant altruism—and if I have struck you
with, some slight emphasis on, the nose, 'tis scarce needful to
shriek in that distressing way!”
He seated himself comfortably in the corner, and then turning
towards his still sobbing sister, poised a large currant deftly on
the thumb of his right hand.
“JEMIMA, it were wiser to rejoice that you have a brother who
is in truth a paragon of virtue. Why lament that the low and
sordid delight of eating this pie is withheld from you? Yours is
to be a far rarer and more subtle pleasure, which I will now
afford you, even at the risk of some personal inconvenience. This
afternoon have I finished that pot of strawberry-jam which I
stole—nay, that is a Philistine word—which I rescued from the
store-room. Subsequently I took to my inmost self at tea-time
two meretricious muffins and six coquettish crumpets. Yet, so
admirable is my courage, so dauntless my virtue, that I will not
shrink from this present task, I will not deny you this purest
pleasure. You shall not eat this pie, JEMIMA, but—happy, happy
girl!—you shall see me eat it!”
There was a tense silence as JACK HoRNER swallowed mouthful
after mouthful., “Dear, delicious morsell” he exclaimed, apos-
trophising the large currant which still rested on his thumb,
“ripened, perchance, in sunny Greece, replete with the divine
Greek charm, you are placed at last in no unworthy mouth !” . . .
It was all over. The deed was accomplished. Not a crumb of
the pie remained. But JACK HoRNER grew white and pale, while
his sister regarded him with wicked glee.
“Alack,” he moaned, “’tis ever the lot of the truly good to
sufferſ A strange feeling of depression is stealing over me!

[A certain wºekly paper is said to have established a British Equivalent fo

Man, 1897.
DeAR MR. PUNCH,-Your attention may have been directed to
a recent epoch-making announcement in the pages of The School-
master at Home. The staff of that leading organ of criticism has
decided to establish a Ménagerie Littéraire. Already it has
tentatively published a list of the Greatest Forty. Once a year
it, threatens to select a work, of signal merit and crown, it
(Fr. couronner) with a Triple-Expansion Grand Piano. It has
further arranged for the coronation of a book by some young
aspirant. The tiara in this case will take the shape of a Small
Cottage Street-organ. It is felt that this munificent offer will
furnish a noble source of sustinence to the starving hero of the
year; and, apart from the grosser incentive, will encourage even
the Greatest Writers to become, if possible, Greater Still.
But, weighty as must always be the authority of such a journal
as The Schoolmaster at Home, I can hardly doubt but that some
of The Rejected will appeal against its verdict to your sympa-
thetic and erudite judgment. My many friends (including notori-
ous pulpit-orators) have urged me, much against the instincts
of modesty, to write to you on my own claims. I am emboldened
to take upon me this uncongenial task by the kindly appreciation
you have already extended to my latest masterpiece, The Heathen.
To have come home to something like 100,000 beating British
bosoms ought, you would suppose, to entitle a writer to rank
within thirty-six places, say, of the Duke of Argyll. I think I
have the authority of the President of the inoculated Society of
Authors (whose name, I notice, is no more there than mine) for
contending that, Popularity is the true measure of Literary
Distinction. But as it has never been my habit to boom my own
work, I merely ask for a referendum to be addressed to the great
heart of England.

those inharmonious wailings!), I will now seat myself in yonder
corner, secluded as far as may be from the debasing horrors of
the nursery furniture.”
He moved towards the corner, but paused for awhile at the
table. “Ah, what have we here?” he murmured. “Yes, it is
one of those º relics of an effete superstition—it is, in fact,
what they call ‘a Christmas pie.” Yes, this strange emblem of
the benighted past shall accompany me to my corner. 'Twill
furnish food for both mind and body. Dear pie, let us wend
together! 35
That is my pie!”, cried his sister, angrily.
He turned towards her, and with inimitable grace laid his
thumb lightly upon his nose and spread his tapering fingers to-
wards the girl.
have done for ever with those foolish distinctions. Whether
'twas once yours matters not; rest content to know that at least
'tis mine now. We have done with the bad old modes of thought,
we have done with ignorant altruism—and if I have struck you
with, some slight emphasis on, the nose, 'tis scarce needful to
shriek in that #: way !”
He seated himself comfortably in the corner, and then turning
towards his still sobbing sister, poised a large currant deftly on
the thumb of his right hand.
“JEMIMA, it were wiser to rejoice that you have a brother who
is in truth a paragon of virtue. Why lament that the low and
sordid delight of eating this pie is withheld from you? Yours is
to be a far rarer and more subtle pleasure, which I will now
afford you, even at the risk of some personal inconvenience. This
afternoon have I finished that pot of strawberry-jam which I
stole—nay, that is a Philistine word—which I rescued from the
store-room. Subsequently I took to my inmost self at tea-time
two meretricious muffins and six coquettish crumpets. Yet, so
admirable is my courage, so dauntless my virtue, that I will not
shrink from this present task, I will not deny you this purest
pleasure. You shall not eat this pie, JEMIMA, but—happy, happy
girl!—you shall see me eat it!”
There was a tense silence as JACK HoRNER swallowed mouthful
after mouthful. “Dear, delicious morsel !” he exclaimed, apos-
trophising the large currant which still rested on his thumb,
“ripened, perchance, in sunny Greece, replete with the divine
Greek charm, you are placed at last in no unworthy mouth !” . . .
It was all over. The deed was accomplished. Not a crumb of
the pie remained. But JACK HoRNER grew white and pale, while
his sister regarded him with wicked glee.
“Alack,” he moaned, “’tis ever the lot of the truly good to
sufferſ A strange feeling of depression is stealing over me!
. . . . JEMIMA,” he added, in strangely altered accents, “don’t
sit there giggling like that, you little boobyl, Can't you see I’m

“You are so crude, JEMIMA,” he said in weary tones. “We
ill? Go and fetch the nurse, dear JEMIMA–and do please be quick!”

TOBY, M.P.'S PARLIAMENTARY GUIDE.
III.
The Speaker put the Question.—The new
Member will do well to train himself in
observing where the Speaker puts the
question. . As he may learn to his cost,
there is significant difference between the
Speaker putting the question in his boots,
under the cushion of his Chair, or simply
in his pocket.
“I am sure hon. Gentlemen near me will
bear me out when I say—”—Next to
moving the Speaker out of the Chair, a
Parliamentary proceeding already de-
scribed, this is the most popular, as tending
to vary the monotony .# a dull sitting. It “Hon. Gentlemen near me will bear me out
indicating the probable course of a debate.
Members listen to what the gentleman on
his legs has to say, and if they agree with
his assertion or argument, those near him
instantly jump up, and generously confirm
his expectation that they will “bear him
out,” dropping him either in the Central
Lobby or down the main staircase, as he
is personally popular or otherwise. if they
dissent, they ignore his invitation. Old
Parliamentary Hands often forecast the
issue of an important debate, simply from
watching this course of procedure. -
Sark tells me this custom had something
to do with the rejection, by a small ma-
jority, of MATTHEw WHITE RIDLEY, when
he offered himself as a candidate for the
Speakership. Had he scaled even a stun
less, he might have run Mr. GULLY nearer.
But every pound over sixteen stun obvi-
ously increases the difficulty of “moving
the Speaker out of the Chair.” Members
think of this when called upon to decide
between the candidates for the Speaker-
ship.
SPORTIVE SONGS.
A Sporting Cavalier, sojourning on the South
Downs, unwittingly takes wrong course to the
trysting-place of the Hounds, and is grievously
disappointed.
THE morning mist is wan and grey
Sweeping across the blue-green downs,
Hiding the dawning of the day
With wind-borne wrinkles, foggy frowns.
The air is nipping, taking hold
As Dunstan did the Deuce's nose,
And clutching with its fingers cold
The limbs that still demand repose.
For many a mile I'll have to ride
Across the short-clipped, wintry sward,
Before I reach the covert-side, .
Where I may find my right reward.
She knows the guerdon that I seek,
A glance, a word, may be a smile,
And, were all Nature thrice as bleak,
I'd ride a league for every mile!
I see you sitting on your bay,
Diana-Vernon-like, you seem.
Oh! would that I could hymn a lay!
Or symbolise a painter's dream
Of all that's femininely fair,
Of all that’s beautiful and true!
Both song and picture should be rare
Because they’d only speak of you?
Of you, the Princess of the Wold,
My Lady of the laughing eyes,
That can such merriment unfold,
And give to Hope what Love denies!
Of you, who sent that little note!
'Tis next my heart! I do declare
'Tis warmer than my overcoat!
“At Upton Gorze, shall you be there?”
Thus thinking of you as we speed
O'er broken ridge and chalky hill,
O'er dyke and ditch, no check I heed;
I ride with purposeness of will.
Nearer and nearer yet we draw
To Upton Gorze. The goal is near.
The air that I thought chill and raw,
Is now divinely warm and clear !
The Gorze at last! No one in sight!
No hounds! No field | Am I too late P
My watch l Oh! yes; the hour's all right!
I breathe again. Of course, I’ll wait.
A yokel! “Hi! what time's the meet?”
“What meet? There's none out here
to-day!”
“At Upton Gorze,” I twice repeat.

“Oh! Upton I That's ten miles away!!”

ABROAD IN THE AUTUMN.
Budapest.—The Hungarian begins the day in clouds of tobacco
smoke. He hastens through the dangerous freshness of the outer
air, to a café, where the double doors and double windows, care-
fully, closed, have preserved intact the cozy atmosphere of the
previous evening. Here he obtains the national breakfast—one
strong "; one glass of cold water, and one glass of coffee and
cream. After breakfast he smokes another cigar, and two more
glasses of cold water are placed before him. This second supply
of water is not intended for serious drinking, but only for sipping,
like a liqueur. He dines in clouds of tobacco, he sups in them
also, still protected from the dangerous fresh air by double win-
dows and double doors, he works, in his office or his bank, in the
same snug atmosphere, if he travels he has double windows in the
railway carriage, and he finishes the evening, probably in the
café where he has breakfasted, with some more cigars and some
. water, in a still more solid air. His complexion is usually
Sailow.
The Hungarian is intensely patriotic. He even smokes Hun-
garian tobacco. As evidence of his patriotism he is not com-
pelled, as the German Bohemian seems to be, to make speeches
twelve hours long in public, but if he gets hold of you in private,
in a train or an hotel, he will make speeches quite sufficiently
ºf to satisfy any reasonable stranger. He has a fine country,
and everything in it, from gold to pepper. No one has ever
seen his gold, because it is all paper. As for his pepper,
it looks as if it were all red lead, but it turns out to
be excellent. He has his own pepper, his paprika, which is
quite unlike other people's, and he has his own language, which
is more so. And he thrusts them both down your throat whether
you like them or not. If you do not appreciate his pepper, or
understand his language, you must go without.
used them both a thousand years ago, and has used no other since.
In Italy, notices in public buildings are often translated into
French, in Germany, frequently into English, though there are
º: who know Italian, and some even who understand German.
ut no stranger knows a single word of the Magyar language.
The Hungarian does not care. If he is too proud to use Ger-
man, he might try French, or even Latin, a language as respect-
Probably he Y
able as his. Not he He puts * notices which may mean
“Entrance,” “No admittance,” “This way out,” “Private,”
“Emergency Exit,” “Push,” “Pull,” “Back in Half an Hour,”
or anything else, as far as the hapless stranger can tell. One
must ask a bystander for a translation. Even on the steamers
one would have to ask the man at the wheel to translate the
notice which forbids one to speak to him.
It would be an advantage to understand some of the regula-
tions in Pest. On the chief bridge over the Danube the foot-
passengers in each direction keep to one side. Small policemen,
armed with swords, and wearing bowler hats with long white
feathers in them, stand at the entrances to keep order. I have
no doubt that no one must turn back. If you once got on,
having paid your kreutzer, and found you had forgotten your
handkerchief or your umbrella, you must go all across the bridge
to the other side and come back correctly.
If the language bore the faintest resemblance to any other, an
enterprising tourist might learn a few words. In most countries
the º starts the day with a word the first letter of
which is B–bath, bain, Bad, bagno, baſio, and so forth. When
you begin with a fürdő, and try to rub yourself with a huge,
chilly, i.e. sheet, you feel that you are indeed in a strange
land.
In some words, however, the language is so like others that
you understand it perfectly. When you see “A villa,” you feel
quite at home. But the wily Magyar does not let you down so
easily. It is only his fun. For a villa means “the fork.” And
when you see “Befittek” in a bill of fare you know what that
means. So would a Frenchman. It is of course the Hungarian
spelling of Bifteck. But the waiter brings you a small quantity of
stewed fruit, a German compot, |. as you are expecting the
satisfying filet, and you find that the Magyar has º: again.
ou rub your eyes still more when you see on the paddle-box of
a steamer the word “Margit.” Can it be that this boat goes
down the Danube, through the Dardanelles, and across the
Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay, to the Kentish coast
Again the Magyar has, deceived you. That is his rendering of
the name “Margaret.” So at last you become reconciled to
“Bécs,” which is the way he spells “Vienna.”

SPORTIWE SONGS.
A Pedant, roused by the piteous appeal of a
damosel worsted by critics over a literary essay,
writes to console her.
SoME little cares, some little woes,
Some fickle friends, some bitter foes,
Some water from a Critic's hose,
Is this the tale you tell, dear?
The cares and woes may both be drowned
Together with the friends unsound;
The Critic—why, when you're renowned
He'll long have dried his well, dear!
Think not, my sweet, that tongue or pen
Can make or mar the aims of men;
They only bar the course—and then
They fall like chains disjointed.
You'll notice that of “men” I speak,
The ever striving, ever weak,
But take advice from one who, meek,
Is also disappointed!
Once was the day I longed for fame
All prone to gain an honoured name,
And light the world with such a flame
As would mankind go blinking.
I’d novels write that would excel
Or READE's great style or BALzAc's spell;
I soared aloft—and crushed I fell,
And that set me a-thinking!
Thinking am I from day to day,
The while my hair grows yet more grey,
But yet my course I will not stay,
No Critic yet could blind me.
The Plough of Time may furrows make,
But still good seed will good crops take,
And on that soil it’s mine to stake
The all I leave behind me !
So, little girl (I call you so
Because l knew you long ago,
Before you ever had a foe),
Be firm in aspiration.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-There is a widespread feeling among
Persian scholars that injustice has been done to Mr. LE GALLI-
ENNE.. I am not, for the moment, regarding him as the Expert
in Under Linen, nor as the pensive Narcissus who collapsed before
the apparition of his own beauty. Others, perhaps he himself,
will vindicate his claims in these attractive rôles. It is as one
of the ardent lovers of the great RUBAIYAt that I speak. Long
dissatisfied with the old-flavoured rendering of FitzGERALD, embar-
rassed as his genius was by a disturbing familiarity with the actual
Persian language, we have waited patiently for a poet who
would give us our OMAR untainted by the emasculating ingredi-
ents of scholarship. Such a godsend we at length find in Mr.
LE GALLIENNE. Not wholly free from bondage, for he has fol-
lowed FITzgerald's scheme of quatrains out of a fine deference
for tradition, he can yet revel in that prancing license which is
only given to the translator who is absolutely ignorant of his
original. If his courage serve his as well as his innocence of
tongues, we shall yet look for new and nobler renderings, of
HoRACE, say, or ANACREoN, or Isaiah, to which a knowledge of
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew respectively contributes no distract-
ing element, Yours, &c., A MEMBER of THE Above.
P.S.—By the way, *ing ºf HoRAce, I disapprove the follow-
ing version of Carm. I., (Persicos, odi, puer, apparatus),
given in the liberal manner of our friend:
Reader, I hate your dim pedantic Persian;
I want no whiff of OMAR's rose divine;

stroke of the pen. From any Ménagerie Littéraire of mine I
would exclude all those who write with the definite purpose of
saying something. Style should be my only standard: abstract
style jºy sense. Personally, as you well know, I write
sense, and this would always be fatal to my assumption of the
crown as advertised. Beginning, therefore, with myself (as if I
were actually in the list), I eliminate all those in whose work
the thing said is of more value than the manner of saying. All
critics (even Mr. ARCHER) must go. This disposes of half the
list. Away with all historians, away with most novelists (they
are sadly purposeful), away with poets (those who mean some-
thing) ºf dramatists (who are never literary, though Arma
virumque was a pretty thing), and away with men of science (I beg
ardon, I see there are none in the list). RUSKIN is a prophet;
§º. I understand, is a politician; ARGYLL is a Peer.
Remain—Mr. Swinburne, Mrs. MEYNELL, Mr. HENRY JAMEs.
I will let you have the supplementary thirty-seven some other day.

arrived at, I may well believe, without great and conceivably
painful searching of the heart and reins—which has, with un-
erring instinct, consigned to my literary achievements, such as
they are, have been, and, I must anticipate, are never likely to be
again, a position within measurable distance of the very summit
or acme of distinction.
To this satisfaction I confess with the more lively candour, in-
asmuch as I have from time to time been the victim of a harras-
sing apprehension, now shown to be causeless, that the over-
shadowing importance of the part played by me, over a more
than ordinarily extended ºf of activity, in the service of the
nation's parliaments, might obscure, by its more readily cognisable
º to the popular fancy, those excursive operations in the
field of literary labour—limited as they have been by the exigen-
cies of a public career at no time relieved by a superflux of
leisure—in which I seem to discover my most abiding claim to
the approval of posterity.
The argument may be advanced by my adversaries—for such a
contention I do not shrink to prognosticate—that I have seldom,
to borrow a phrase from the terminology of forestry, broken fresh
ground in literature; that I have, in the main, but translated or
conveyed from the more humane of ancient letters, if I have not
actually marched through rapine and plunder to the attainment
of my designs. To this contention I will reply in one word—for
the hour presses, and the post-card, of a pliable consistency, on
which I forward these observations, has already thrice over ac-
quired the similitude of a palimpsest—that it is not only
intelligible, but even capable of demonstration, that a sincere
student of another's work may, by force of mental detachment and
abstraction of self, so far merge his own individuality in that of
the object of his veneration, as, in the evolution of time, to be-
come positively absorbed in, and identified with, that object.
Conscious, in my own case, of the development of some such
process, not materially differing in kind from the process of
metempsychosis, the conviction has been resistlessly borne home
upon me—and the warm place which I have secured, or, to speak
precisely, the possession of which has been of late days emphati-
cally confirmed, in the heart of the Greek Ethnos by my per-
sonal, and, as the issue proved, deplorable intervention in that
crisis which resulted in such lamentably bellicose eventualities,
has only tended to endorse this conviction—it has, I repeat, been
irresistibly borne home to me, that I am the actual author of the
so-called Homeric cycle of poems.
I might add, if it is not too obviously alien to the foregoing
assertion—that, while I cannot altogether admit my approval of
the inclusion, so close to my own name, of that of my political
opponent and late supporter, the Duke of Argyll, it is not with-
out gratification and an impregnably-rooted sense of the justice
of this arrangement, that I remark to how relatively low a position
the merits of humour, as exemplified in the persons of Messrs.
W. S. GILBERT and “Lewis CARRoll,” have been relegated.

A SEASONABLE ARTICLE.

EDw1N and ANGELINA lingered by the sunlit waves. He was
wearing a suit of tweeds, and she a gown of muslin. Their cos-
tumes were those they had adopted in the height of summer.
“You are sure you are warmly clad P” he suggested.
“Too warmly. It was a mistake to bring this thin, diapha-
nous-looking cloak. I told you I would not want it.”
“My darling, you cannot be too careful,” the cousin intime
continued. They listened to the songs of the birds and gazed
at the trees as the new leaves showed themselves in buds upon
the branches. She put up her en-tout-cas to ward off the fierce
rays of the sun; he lay on the shore, throwing pebbles into

in the fireplace, and he opened the window.

SOME QUERIES AND SURMISES.
(By a Man on the Penny Bus, on passing through Knightsbridge.)
WHY have the local authorities so carefully selected the middle
of November in order to block the busiest part of this thorough-
fare, when there was all September in which to execute the
repairs?
Are they laying down a chicken-run in the road opposite
Sloane Street? It is nicely covered with a thin layer of gravel,
and railed off, and only seems to be waiting for a few barn-door
fowl or live-stock of some kind.
Or perhaps these bunkers indicate that the occupants of the
Hyde Park Club are going to start a private golf-links in the
middle of the street. We shall soon have lost the right of way
over these solitudes.
Query, by Rule of Three, if two British workmen, pottering
over the job for the usual number of hours a day, and consuming
the regulation amount of beer, take more than three weeks in
repairing the hundred yards section at Albert Gate, how long,
more or less, will Piccadilly be “up,” and how many citizens'
tempers will be lost in the period?
Why don't they put on a night shift? Is it because they are
afraid of disturbing the sleep of the rude forefathers (or the

MEGUM.
(At the Service of both Moderates
and Progressives.)
Question. You take an interest in the
School-Board election?
Answer. Naturally, as the amount of our
cates depends upon its result.
Q. You are in favour of maintaining the
afficiency of the teachers?
A. Yes; if it can be accomplished with-
put sacrificing the interest of our pockets.
Q. And you would not reduce their
number?
A. No ; if the number could be main-
tained at less expense.
Q. And you would have sufficient school
houses?
A. Certainly; but not greater expendi-
ture.
Q. Are there, in your opinion, too many
A. Yes, and no. Of course, the supply
ought to keep pace with the demand, but
then the demand should not be satisfied
on a false basis.
Q. Is that not a complicated reply?
A. It is ; but that is no uncommon
thing with matters connected with the
School Board.
Q. Well, is it not possible to make the
answer plainer—by example, for instance P
A. If there is an increase of seven hun-
dred scholars, it seems extravagant to
secure accommodation for seven thousand.
Q. But that is not the universal opinion?
A. No, it is not; for non-ratepayers
have no objection to expenditure to which
they do not contribute.
Q. I presume that this would be the
opinion of the Moderates?
A. Yes; but human nature is human
nature, and most people like to be chari-
table when they can display the virtue
Q. And what is your view of the reli-
gious difficulty P
A. That it is a difficulty, and as such,
better avoided.
Q. But cannot a compromise be secured
acceptable to both Moderates and Progres-
sives? -
A. Yes, if the principle of Free Trade in
* is extended to Free Trade in
belief.
Q. Is not the present contest causing an
immense amount of excitement and work?
A. It is, amongst women as well as men.
#, Is it not creating a good deal of ill-
will
A. Unquestionably, converting neigh-
bours into strangers by the score and the
aundred.
Q. And whichever side wins, what is the
probable result P -
A. That the School-Board rate of the
next three years will be as great as, if not
greater than, the three years preceding
them.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (SMITH, ELDER)
make a good book spoiled for lack of good editing. If it had been one
volume instead of two, it would have been a delightful possession.
As it is, my Baronite finds, in a sentence in which Mrs. BRowNING
gave her opinion upon Mary Barton, an accurate judgment of
the work. “There is power and truth,” Mrs. BrownING, in
critical mood, wrote about this forgotten novel, “but I wish half
the book away, it is so tedious every now and then.” Mr.
KENyon's devotion to the subject of his work has fatally marred
its execution. He shovels in every scrap of correspondence
sanctified by his idol's signature. This i"ai enough to begin
with, but when the baby is born, the condition of the conscienti-
ous reader becomes hopeless. Penini, the pet name of this phe-
nomenon, from the day of his birth to th. close of the last
volume, appears on nearly every page. How he looked, what he
ate, what É. said, and what other people, said of him—all set
forth in pitiless detail. This is sad, but if the reader skips many
of the letters at the opening of the first volume and dodges Penini
throughout the second, he will find his reward. Mrs. Brown ING's
prose is even better than her poetry. She can picture an Alpine
scene, and describe a man or woman in a single flashing sentence.
The rare beauty of her character is disclosed in her bearing to-
ward a father who, if there be such a thing as transmigration of
souls, is at this moment capering round somewhere in his proper
shape as a mule. He deliberately did his brutal worst to wreck
his gifted daughter's life. For him through it all she breathes
no word save of almost passionate affection. As a proof of Mrs.
BRowNING's sound iudgment, this extract from a letter dated
should be more willing to take our politics from Punch than from
any other of the newspaper oracles.”
Cassell & Co. in their publication, The Magazine of Art, pre-
sent one of the most interesting gift-books of the year. #.
same firm insinuatingly leads the little ones into Micky Magee's
Menagerie, by S. H. HAMER, comically illustrated by HARRY
NEILson, a wonderland that never fails to captivate the fancy
of the very youthful student of unnatural history.
The Story of Edison, by FRANK MUNDELL (JARRold AND SoNs),
tells in chatty style how this brilliant genius from a simple paper-
boy on an American train became the greatest scientific dis-
coverer—our modern edition of Aladdin and his wonderful
electric-light lamp.
A delightful continuation of his Roman Series is The Corleone
(MACMILLAN & Co.), by Mr. MARIon CRAwford. The reader's
interest in the story, roused at the commencement, grows in
intensity as the plot is artistically developed to its climax. Mr.
CRAwford's pictures of Italian scenery are perfect, and his cha-
racters, belonging to the Roman Society, with which he has
familiarised us in so many of his books, are living beings before
our eyes.

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
No. IV.-To The GERMAN EMPERoR.
SIR,--I notice that in the Empire which you attempt to
govern with much bombast and lack of discretion the crime of
lºse-majesté has of late assumed a considerable prominence. Care-
ful and cunning journalists have found that it is useless to wrap
up distant allusions to your Imperial aberrations in a historical
essay on the aberrations of CALIGULA, the megalomaniac; while
politicians who imagined that their position secured them from
attack discovered too late, when they languished in a dungeon,
that the regis voluntas, which is in Germany the suprema lear, had
arbitrarily ordained their punishment for offences due to your
own imperial perversity. W. Sir, I am about, I suppose, to
commit lºse-majesté to a large extent; but as I run no risk of
suffering, I am not inclined to consider, myself on that account
as a specially daring man. Still, it is well that somewhere, if not
in the journals of your own iand, you should be able to see your-
self as others see you, to digest in the privacy of your own
chamber, without any disturbing thoughts of a possible prosecu-
tion, the candid views of an i. on. This privilege
I propose to afford you.
Sir, you are no longer a young man. Time, the arch tyrant,
deals capriciously with his subjects. To some it is permitted to
retain far into middle age the insignia of slim and joyous youth.
To others are awarded ºš. marks of age long before they begin in
reality to slide down the hill of life. You have, I admit, fared
not otherwise than well at his hands. For a lon riod you have
been able, by means of tight tunics and a .#. of
face, to defy the inroads of the enemy, and those who saw you
prance and bound, and heard you shout and bluster, who watched
your astounding feats on the telegraph, and, if they honoured
the next place of your breakin
excuse you to themselves and the world at large on the ground
that you were a mere boy. But all that is now past. We have
all seen your latest photograph: it was reproduced in our own
picture-papers in all its rotund and sporting splendour. There,
posed at the side of the kind, grey Emperor of Austria, we saw
you, no longer slim, no longer youthful, but adipose and puffy
and protuberant, girthed round as to your middle with a hunting:
belt that only served to make two prominences where one had
sufficed, and wearing on your head a hat that suited strangely
with the un-Tyrolean aspect of your countenance and your figure.
It was the picture of one who has liked himself and his food too
much for too many years. It was emphatically not the picture
of a youth.
Such a vision, Sir, makes a change in one's views. Formerly.1
imagined that throughout Germany, and from time to time in
Russia, Austria, or in Italy, an imperial but soaringly human boy
was lifting his glass and crying, “Hoch! Hoch! Hoch!” amid
the clatter of swords and the admiring shouts of a profusely-
decorated soldiery. Now I know that a stout gentleman is doing
these things, and reducing his hearers to an abyss of melancholy
at his dismal failure in dignity. A boy who played fantastic
tricks with the telegraph-wires incurred but a mild censure.
What shall be said of a middle-aged and pompous party whose
pleasure it is to play practical jokes that set two nations by
the ears? -
Yours is a great inheritance, greatly won by heroic deeds.
Your people are by nature the mildest and most loyal, and by
tradition and education the most thoughtful, in Europe. But
mild and loyal as they are their minds must rise in revolt against
a sovereign who reproduces in the crudest form the stale theories
of divine right and arbitrary government, whose one notion of

The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (SMITH, ELDER)
make a good book spoiled for lack of good editing. If it had been one
volume instead of two, it would have been a delightful possession.
As it is, my Baronite finds, in a sentence in which Mrs. BRowNING
gave her opinion upon Mary Barton, an accurate judgment of
the work. “There is power and truth,” Mrs. Browning, in
critical mood, wrote about this forgotten novel, “but I wish half
the book away, it is so tedious every now and then.” Mr.
KENYon's devotion to the subject of his work has fatally marred
its execution. He shovels in every scrap of correspondence
sanctified by his idol's signature... This is enough to begin
with, but * the baby is born, the condition of the conscienti-
ous reader becomes hopeless. Penini, the pet name of this phe-
nomenon, from the day of his birth to th. close of the last
volume, ap on nearly every page. How he looked, what he
ate, what É. said, and what other people, said of him—all set
forth in pitiless detail. This is sad, but if the reader skips many
of the letters at the opening of the first volume and dodges Penini
throughout the second, he will find his reward. Mrs. Browning's
prose is even better than her poetry. She can picture an Alpine
scene, and describe a man or woman in a single flashing sentence.
The rare beauty of her character is disclosed in her bearing to-
ward a father who, if there be such a thing as transmigration of
souls, is at this moment capering round somewhere in his proper
shape as a mule. He ãº did his brutal worst to wreck
his gifted daughter's life. For him through it all she breathes
no word save of almost passionate affection. As a proof of Mrs.
BRowNING's sound judgment, this extract from a letter dated
October 5, 1844, will serve: “Do you take in Punch f If not,"
should be more willing to take our politics from Punch than from
any other of the newspaper oracles.”

same firm iº's leads the little ones into Micky Magee's
Menagerie, by S. H. HAMER, comically illustrated by HARRY

of the very youthful student of unnatural history.
The Story of Edison, by FRANK MUNDELL (JARRold AND SoNs),
tells in chatty style how this brilliant genius from a simple paper-
boy on an American train became the greatest scientific dis-
coverer—our modern edition of Aladdin and his wonderful
electric-light lamp.
A delightful continuation of his Roman Series is The Corleone
(MACMILLAN & Co.), by Mr. MARIon CRAwford. The reader's
interest in the story, roused at the commencement, grows in
intensity as the plot is artistically developed to its climax. Mr.
CRAwford's pictures of Italian scenery are perfect, and his cha-
racters, belonging to the Roman Society, with which he has
familiarised us in so many of his books, are living beings before
our eyes.

contemporaries might have a look in. What's the use of a lot

Address-Minerva Villa, Clapham.—Quite another opening for
women. Soldiers could be easily replaced by Amazons. It has
been done before. Even the uniform might be modified to allow
of the divided skirt and other improvements. And as to cam-
aigning, that might be as easily managed as a game of chess. Only
. to settle rules of the game. Cavalry retire on approach of
artillery and that kind of thing. Certainly the army would be a
splendid opening for women—if they would do away with the
Address–Portsmouth.-Why not leave matters as they are?
Thin red line and that sort of thing. Of course, the fleet will
keep off the enemy. If it doesn't, why, the sooner it's over the
better. Army fine service, but it's no use increasing it indefi-
nitely. The navy is the thing, Sir. There’s nothing like iron.

All nonsense about payment for insurance. Of course, if there

The GREAT Fight BETweeN Sullivanus AND PEDLARI PALMERIUS AT THE SUPERBUs SPORTING CLUB,
LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
No. W.--To The Rt. HoN. ARTHUR JAMEs BALFour, M.P.
MY DEAR SIR,-As I strolled along Pall Mall or in the neigh-
bourhood of the Palace at Westminster, mescio quid meditans
nugarum, it has occasionally been my good fortune to meet a tall
figure sedately and delicately pacing in the opposite direction.
The gait, indeed, was almost languid, the head hung but loosely
on the shoulders, and the face, small in proportion to the
attenuated length of body and limbs, wore a pale air of detached
absorption suited to a temperament at once poetical and philo-
sophic. The clothes carried by this slow walker might not have
passed the exacting muster of the Tailor and Cutter, that
Argus-eyed, sartorial authority whose young men criticise with
an equal freedom the painted trousers of statesmen at the Royal
Academy show; and the double-breasted frock-coat of the Duke
of York disembarking in Ireland. Still the clothes had about
them a neglectful looseness of fit, an exuberance of folds that

that this figure was you, a statesman, a man of action, an
undaunted fighter; a man, in short, who, whatever else his
opponents might say of him, was acknowledged by them, and by
his friends to have faced, with a rigid determination and a com-
F. success, the fiercest onslaughts of the Irishry and their
iberal allies during the stormy years from 1887 onward.
And yet, Sir, are you sure that you have chosen the better

perhaps, fatuous to say of successful men that, had they turned
their energies into a different channel, their success would have
been ter and more striking. Thus Mr. JoHN BRIGHT has
been described as a prize-fighter wasted, Mr. GLAPSTONE as a
Prince of the Church in the guise of a political leader, and the
Archbishop of CANTERBURY as a Field-Marshal, in black gaiters
and lawn sleeves. On the whole, I think it is better to believe
that men as a rule pursue the careers for which they are best
fitted, and if Rogers, for instance, had never been a banker, I
doubt if the stock of the world's great poetry would have been
sensibly increased. And so it is probably with you... You engage
in politics because politics provide for your. mind the zest. it
uires, because you have found that in politics your energies

speculate on what might have been. For you can think and can
write. You have the gift of style; you wield a piercing dialectic
rapier; philosophic speculation fascinates you; you are literary,
musical, sympathetic. Do these qualities find their best arena in
the turmoil of politics? Can they match themselves successfully
in the long run against the vulgar blatancy of—well, of any
pushing, brazen, hippopotamus-hided, self-advertising politician
who may be thrusting and struggling for place and power
without much regard to the weapons he uses? I hope they can
I wish to believe they can, for I confess it would be a disma
day for us if we had to acknowledge that mere vulgarity and
smartness must in the end submerge scholarly courtesy and
geniality. I leave the mather there. I do not presume to
formulate an answer which Time in any case will provide.
One hint I may give. Keep clear, if you can, of fads and
cranks. A subtle intellect, no doubt, finds a pleasure in threading
the mazes of bimetallism; but to a practical English statesman,
a Minister in a prosperous country, the centre of the world's
commerce, these tricky attempts to tamper with ancient and well-
grounded systems are a weakness. In .* you may have

CALLS TO ARMS.
(Latest Collection of Opinions )
Address—Army and Navy Club.-Of course revive the Militia
ballot. Never ought to have been allowed to drop. Good pro-
vision for the service, Sir. As for the volunteers—pooh, Sir,
pooh! Army ought to be six times as large. Then I and my
contemporaries might have a look in. What's the use of a lot
of Johnnies of fifteen, and generals of fifty. Want the seasoned
article, Sir, want the seasoned article.—MAJor—AGED SixTY.
Address-Minerva Villa, Clapham-Quite another opening for
women. Soldiers could be easily replaced by Amazons. It has
been done before. Even the uniform might be modified to allow
of the divided skirt and other improvements. And as to cam-
aigning, that might be as easily managed as a game of chess. Only
. to settle rules of the game. Cavalry retire on approach of
artillery and that kind of thing. Certainly the army would be a
Address—Portsmouth.-Why not leave matters as they are P
Thin red line and that sort of thing. Of course, the fleet will
keep off the enemy. If it doesn't, why, the sooner it's over the
better. Army fine service, but it's no use increasing, it indefi-
nitely. The navy is the thing, Sir. There’s nothing like iron.
ADMIRAL.
Address—Upper Middleclassington Road, Tooting.—Of course,
patriotism is all very well, but how about the rates and taxes?
All nonsense about payment for insurance. Of course, if there
were an invasion, the nation would rise like one man. Have done
it before, would do it again. So it’s folly to talk about increasing
the Army Estimates. Can't really afford it—can't really afford it.
PATERFAMILIAs.
Address—85, Fleet Street.—Enough talk. Action is wanted.
Delay is dangerous. British Empire can't stand still when the
rest of the world is moving. The order of the day is “ Forward l’”
—not “As you were !” Entire British race, “ Attention.

figure sedately and delicately pacing in the opposite direction.
The * indeed, was almost languid, the head hung but loosely
on the shoulders, and the face, small in proportion to the
attenuated length of body and limbs, wore a pale air of detached
absorption suited to a temperament at once poetical and philo-
sophic. The clothes carried by this slow walker might not have
passed the exacting muster of the Tailor and Cutter, that
Argus-eyed, sartorial authority whose young men criticise with
an equal freedom the painted trousers of statesmen at the Royal
Academy show, and double-breasted frock-coat of the Duke
of York disembarking in Ireland. Still the clothes had about
them a neglectful looseness of fit, an exuberance of folds that
seemed to suit a man of thought, a philosopher, let us say, or a
poet engaged upon the uncongenial task of exercising his limbs in
the open air. #. was not without an effort, then, that I realised

IN offering a third specimen of the

examples will suffice to show how vast an
improvement may be made upon the
“senseless jingles,” as a reviewer has aptly

The grey weariness of our talkirked me.
My glimmering fear dawned to a dreadful
certainty; decidedly MARY had no sense
of things beautiful, in a word, no soul.
Her empty laughter had long since died
away, indeed, a note of ill-temper, almost
of fury, twanged harshly in her speech.
And yet she was so young, so wise, so
beautiful! Deep-hidden, surely, a finer
sense must yet abide in a form so gracious.

“Yet it were scarce necessary to speak so
harshly. But, dear MARY, most unkind,

den thought, “you have a garden?”
“Come, that's much better,” said she.
“I believe you’re going to be intelligible
at last ! Yes, I have a garden.”
“I knew it!” I responded with enthu-
siasm. “To one thus fair must surely

She eyed me strangely. Almost I could
have sworn that a smile lurked around her
mouth.
“My garden? Oh–with silver bells!”
“How exquisite l’” I exclaimed. “Dear,

breezel Tell me more—what else enhances
that subtle charm?”
She was moved—deeply moved. Clearly
she had more feeling that I had supposed.
She had her handkerchief in her mouth,
and her voice trembled, as she gasped:

beauteous as yourself, share its sweet se-

She seemed to be almost suffocated by
the gracious insight of my words. “Lots

the utterance, “lots of 'em! All in a

At this moment MARY suddenly with-

which almost seemed to sound like “Of all

they could not have been.

Fair Thruster (who has just jumped over Friend). “OH, I BEG You R PARDoN, NELL.
I Thought it was A MAN!”
MORE MANNERS FOR WOMEN.
The Girl in Society.—Music and painting are no longer neces-
sary accomplishments. Bicycling and slang are. French is
taken for granted. In these days of travel a little Russian,
Arabic, Hungarian, Basque, and Chinese are useful. The QUEEN
usually converses in Hindustani with the Munshi ABDUL KARIM.
I get a great deal of information about the Court from a former
Royal footman, now a grocer in my neighbourhood.
... At Drawing Rooms.-I could repeat a number of his anecdotes
if I had space. The débutante should not leave the Royal
presence on her hands and knees.
In the Omnibus.--A gentlewoman does not rest her head on
the shoulder of the man next to her. Nor does she stamp on
her neighbour's toes. Self-effacement is her characteristic. If
the Prince of WAIRs is sitting opposite her in an omnibus she
does not stare at him, but looks out of the window behind her,
a difficult thing to do cefully when the omnibus is full, but
easy enough after a little practice.
Cards and Calls.--A card is a thin white piece of paste-board.
This is not generally known. Its size is exactly three-and-a
half by two-and-a-half inches. In the best houses the butler is
provided with an inch measure, and ordered to refuse all cards
of improper dimensions. Correct cards are easily obtained.
Messrs. PASTE AND BoARD supply very good ones.
Weddings.-Tears are bad form. Most human emotions are
bad form. They are out of place in smart restaurants. The
bridegroom pays for whatever he cannot get the bride's father
to pay for. He even furnishes his own house. Everything is
now supplied by caterers. They will supply the bridegroom if
necessary. Messrs. NYves AND FAwkes are an excellent firm.
Dinners.-If the hostess cooks the dinner she is hot and tired
when her guests arrive. In the best houses the dinner is pre-
pared by a cook, sometimes by a chef, or by what I call a cordon
rouge. I don't quite know what this is. Most people call it a
cordon bleu. Perhaps it is a sort of kitchener. inners should
not last for five hours. The signal to leave the table is a nod
catch her eye with anything handy. Avoid giving the signal too
soon, for instance, just as your wealthy bachelor uncle is sipping
his port. Excellent port is supplied by my grocer. You can
give the signal prematurely, if two of the guests seem likely to
come to blows over bimetallism, or any other unwelcome topic.
Up-to-date Entertaining.—This is not entertaining at all, being
merely an “At Home” with dull talk and weak tea. . . -
Correspondence.—Try to spell correctly. If your friends live
at West Kensington do not address the envelope to East Ham-
mersmith. If you live there yourself, or in any other suburb,
have a map of the omnibus route printed on your note-paper.
Even smart women travel in omnibuses now.
Learning to Laugh.-This is very difficult. There are now so
few things to laugh at. This manual, and my other one—for
men—may supply a want.
SURGEONS, PLEASE NOTE.
VERY interesting is the statement contained in the daily
Press that a clever operator has succeeded in transferring the
eyelid of a defunct porker to a human being who had, unfortu-
nately, lost his own by accident. The principle of this trans-
ference suggests the following operations which might be
successfully carried out without materially injuring the bulk
of the patients.
1. To take some of the cheek of the average Trades' Unionist
agitator, and give it to a retiring and modest member of society.
2. Exchange a little of Mr. ALL-N Upw-RD's greece for an
equal portion of Sir ELL-s Ash M-D B-RTL-TT's turkey.
3. To remove portion of Dr. T-NN-R's jaw.
4. To take the nerve of a steeplechase rider, and transfer it
to the Spanish Cabinet in dealing with the Cuban difficulty.
5. Any Barrister on the look-out for an appointment would
benefit greatly by obtaining the ear of either the Lord Chan-
cellor or Home Secretary.

street ruffian or wife-beater.

bitterly that when, “in this decadent month,” the demise of the sea-serpent
and the giant gooseberry is followed by the resurgence of “that ridiculous
monster," an English Academy of Letters, his name should receive the un-
solicited honour of association with so “unimaginable a gathering;” what,

EXCUSE.
I Thought It was A MAN!”
MORE MANNERS FOR WOMEN.
The Girl in Society.—Music and painting are no longer neces-
sary accomplishments. Bicycling and slang are. French is
taken for granted. In these days of travel a little Russian,
Arabic, Hungarian, Basque, and Chinese are useful. The QUEEN
usually converses in Hindustani with the Munshi ABDUL KARIM.
I get a great deal of information about the Court from a former
Royal footman, now a grocer in my neighbourhood.
... 4t, Drawing Rooms.-I could repeat a number of his anecdotes
if I had space. The débutante should not leave the Royal
presence on her hands and knees.
In the Omnibus.--A gentlewoman does not rest her head on
the shoulder of the man next to her. Nor does she stamp on
her neighbour's toes. Self-effacement is her characteristic. If
the Prince of WAIRs is sitting opposite her in an omnibus she
does not stare at him, but looks out of the window behind her,
a difficult thing to do cefully when the omnibus is full, but
easy enough after a little practice.
Cards and Calls.--A card is a thin white piece of paste-board.
This is not generally known. Its size is exactly three-and-a
half by two-and-a-half inches. In the best houses the butler is
provided with an inch measure, and ordered to refuse all cards
of improper dimensions. Correct cards are easily obtained.
Messrs. PAstE AND BoARD supply very good ones.
Weddings.-Tears are bad form. Most human emotions are
form. They are out of place in smart restaurants. The
bridegroom pays for whatever he cannot get the bride's father
to pay for. He even furnishes his own house. Everything is
now supplied by caterers. They will supply the bridegroom if
necessary. Messrs. NYves AND FAwkes are an excellent firm.
Dinners.-If the hostess cooks the dinner she is hot and tired
when her guests arrive. In the best houses the dinner is pre-
pared by a cook, sometimes by a chef, or by what I call a cordon
rouge. I don't quite know what this is. Most people call it a
cordon bleu. Perhaps it is a sort of kitchener. inners should
not last for five hours. The signal to leave the table is a nod
catch her eye with anything handy., Avoid giving the signal too
soon, for instance, just as your wealthy bachelor uncle is sipping
his port. Excellent port, is supplied by my grocer. You can
give the signal prematurely, if two of the guests seem likely to
come to blows over bimetallism, or any other unwelcome topic.
Up-to-date Entertaining.—This is not entertaining at all, being
merely an “At Home” with dull talk and weak tea.
Correspondence.—Try to spell correctly. If your friends live
at West Kensington do not address the envelope to East Ham-
mersmith. If you live there yourself, or in any other suburb,
have a map of the omnibus route printed on your note-paper.
Even smart women travel in omnibuses now.
Learning to Laugh.-This is very difficult. There are now so
few things to laugh at. This manual, and my other one—for
men—may supply a want.
SURGEONS, PLEASE NOTE.
VERY interesting is the statement contained in the daily
Press that a clever operator has succeeded in transferring the
eyelid of a defunct porker to a human being who had ºf...
nately, lost his own by accident. The principle of this trans-
ference suggests the following operations which might be
successfully carried out without materially injuring the bulk
of the patients.
1. To take some of the cheek of the average Trades' Unionist
agitator, and give it to a retiring and modest member of society.
2. Exchange a little of Mr. ALL-N UPw-RD's greece for an
equal portion of Sir ELL-s Ash M-D B-RTL-TT's turkey.
3. To remove portion of Dr. T-NN-R's jaw.
4. To take the nerve of a steeplechase rider, and transfer it
to the Spanish Cabinet in dealing with the Cuban difficulty.
5. Any Barrister on the look-out for an appointment would
benefit greatly by obtaining the ear of either the Lord Chan-
cellor or Home tary.
6. Portion of a cat, applied vigorously to the back of any
street ruffian or wife-beater.

[At a meeting of the Newbury Board of Guar-

. Mr. BEYNoN that the inmates of the “House"
objected to being fed once a week on “potted Zulu.”]
IN wrath the “inmates” have rebelled—
Yet how should they keep cool, who
By cruel fortune are compelled
To live on potted Zulu ?
We sympathize with them, indeed,
The man must be a ghoul, who
Would force a brother man to feed
On prime young potted Zulu.
But Mr. BEYNoN on the Board
Is not the sort of fool, who
Would leave the mystery unexplored—
He finds the knowledge of the map
Possessed by paupers too loose,
They do not know, nor care a rap,
Whence come their potted Zulus.
To them, no doubt, is Teneriffe
The same as Honolulu—
And that is why Australian beef
They christen “potted Zulu.”
Then let no good philanthropists
Their heads, as, oft they do, lose—
It's really beef, the Board insists,
It isn't potted Zulus!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
By a notable coincidence, two novels, almost simultaneously
published, take recent historical epochs for their field, and for the
puppets of their plot borrow famous characters. In God Save the
Queen (CHAtto AND WINDUs), Mr. ALLEN Upward reveals a
hitherto unsuspected conspiracy that gathered round the QUEEN's
accession upon the death of WILLIAM THE FourTH. In For Love
of a Bedouin Maid (Hutchinson), Le Volºur deals with the
time of NApoleon, dating from his unexpected return to Paris
after the Italian campaign, down to his final return to the capital
after Waterloo. It is a rattling story, full of strange adventure,
its hero, St. Just, having one of those charmed lives which distin-
uished Tom Burke of Ours, Charles O'Malley, and other of
EveR's heroes. In the chapters dealing with the search for the
hidden treasure in the subterranean Bedouin city, Le VoIEUR is
not beyond suspicion of having volé (conveyed, the wise call it)
from Mr. RIDER HAGGARD. É. the sagacious reader will not
inquire too closely whence his good things are provided. As a
work of art, God Save the 3. is more deftly wrought, Mr.
Upward, whilst weaving a pleasant story, having succeeded in
investing both scenes and characters with vraisimilitude. In this
year of jubilee, it is especially interesting to learn how narrowly
There is dainty tragedy, says my Baronitess, in The Fairy
Changeling, a short poera by DoRA SIGERson (Mrs. CLEMENT
ShoBTER). The other poems which fill the little volume are
chiefly on old Irish legends, whose charm lies in their quaint
pathos. JoBN LANE of the Bodley Head is the publisher.
Klondyke must prove a welcome mine for the exploration of
the sensationalist. Seated comfortably by a bright fire is the
only way to thoroughly appreciate Hunting for Gold, by HUMe
Nisbet (F. W. White & Co.). The youthful hero, with un-
frozen courage, works through the Yukon valley, till Klondyke
ives him all he has come to dig for. Anything that Mr. HUME
IsBET writes for adventurous boys is welcome. Nothing of
Hume'un interest is unpalatable to our Baronitess.
More Beasts for Worse Children. Verses by H. B., pictures
by B. I Somewhat unkind of the anonymous poet and
artist to qualify the title so comparatively. No doubt the violent
attitude of the tomato-coloured animal, of a Jabberwockian
period, on the cover, will have much to account for this “wuss-
ness” of his small friends. (Published by Edward ARNOLD,
London and New York). Better and happier children will enjoy
the acquaintance of Dumpies, discovered by FRANK WER-
Beck, who must have revealed their existence to ALBERT
BIGELow PAINE, for he has written the history of these delightful
little people, who, from an economical sense of prºpºrtiºn, dwell
in the Low Mountains. should it not have been “the Big-e-low
Mountains?” (KEGAN, PAUL & Co.) For youthful zoological
students the Hon. W. J. Fort Escue tells a simple unvarnished
Story of a # Deer in his Devonshire home. The deer is red,
and so will this s be. (MAOMILLAN & Co.)
The heroine of The Beth Book (HEINEMANN) is one of SARAH
GRAND's most fascinating creations. With such realistic art is
her life set forth that, for a while, the reader will probably be
under the impression that he has before him the actual story of
a wayward genius compiled from her own genuine diary. It is,
the Baron, who º admires the work, ventures to think,
a Grand mistake on the part of the gifted authoress that she
should have written any portion of this book with such a special
purpose in view as must necessarily limit the recommendation
of its perusal to a comparatively narrow circle, not “a vicious
circle,” but one composed of “those who know,” and who grieve,
with Hamlet, that “ever they were born to set, things right.”
Apart from this reservation, the story is absorbing; the truth
to nature in the characters, whether virtuous, ordinary, or
vicious, every reader, with some experience of life, will recognise.
One of the most dramatic situations in it reminds the Baron of
an exactly similar scene in Mrs. Edwards' Morals of Mayfair,
where, in the latter, hero and heroine are caught by the rising of
the tide. In The Beth Book, the heroine, with one of her tempo-
rary lovers, is also caught by the rising of the tide, and has a
very narrow escape.
* Legend of Camelot, &c. (BRADBURY, AGNEw, & Co.), is
a genuine re-publication de lure of GEoRGE DU MAURIER's pic-
tures, poetry, and prose, that from time to time originally
*...; in Mr. Punch's pages. The Legend of Camelot recalls
the maddest period of the “AEsthetic Craze,” when Messrs.
Maudle, Postlethwaite, & Co., a quite “too-too precious” set
of noodles, attitudinising, sighing, groaning, and moaning to
the last, received their coup de grâce from the sharp-pointed
ncil and pen of our cynical artist, GEoRGE DU MAURIER. The
aughable Nursery Rhymes in the funniest French are illustrated
with a weird, grim-goblin humour that is best described as “Du-
Maurieresque”; while his “Society story,” of Mr. and Mrs. Jack
Spratt not only points a moral, but ſº us just a pen-and-
inkling of the germs of the idea which, at a much later date,
was to come to fruition as Trilby. From a literary, as well as
from an artistic point of view, this volume is most welcome.

There is dainty tragedy, says my Baronitess, in The Fairy
Changeling, a short poera by DoRA SIGERson (Mrs. CLEMENT
SHoRTER). The other poems which fill the little volume are
chiefly on old Irish legends, whose charm lies in their quaint
pathos. JoHN LANE of the Bodley Head is the publisher.
Klondyke must prove a welcome mine for the exploration of
the sensationalist. Seated comfortably by a bright fire is the
only way to thoroughly appreciate Hunting for Gold, by HUME
Nisbet (F. W. WHITE & Co.). The youthful hero, with un-
frozen courage, works through the Yukon valley, till Klondyke
ives him all he has come to dig for. Anything that Mr. HUME
IsBET writes for adventurous boys is welcome. Nothing of
Hume'un interest is unpalatable to our Baronitess.
More Beasts for Worse Children. Verses by H. B., pictures
by B. I. B. Somewhat unkind of the anonymous poet and
artist to qualify the title so comparatively. No doubt the violent
attitude of the tomato-coloured animal, of a Jabberwockian
period, on the cover, will have much to account for this “wuss-
ness” of his small friends. (Published by Edward ARNOLD,
London and New York). Better and happier children will enjoy
the acquaintance of Dumpies, discovered by FRANK WER-
Beck, who must have revealed their existence to . ALBERT
BIGELow PAINE, for he has written the history of these delightful
little people, who, from an economical sense of proportion, dwell
in the Low Mountains; should it not have been “the Big-e-low
Mountains?” (KEGAN, PAUL & Co.) For youthful zoological
students the Hon. W. J. Fort Escue tells a simple unvarnished
Story of a Deer in his Devonshire home. The deer is red,
and so will this s be. (MACMILLAN & Co.)
The heroine of The Beth Book (HEINEMANN) is one of SARAH
GRAND's most fascinating creations. With such realistic art is
her life set forth that, for a while, the reader will probably be
under the impression that he has before him the actual story of
a wayward genius ºl. from her own genuine diary. It is,
the Baron, who greatly admires the work, ventures to think,
a Grand mistake on the part of the gifted authoress that she
should have written any portion of this book with such a special
purpose in view as must necessarily limit the recommendation
of its perusal to a comparatively narrow circle, not “a vicious
circle,” but one composed of “those who know,” and who grieve,
with Hamlet, that “ever they were born to set things right.”
Apart from this reservation, the story is absorbing; the truth
to nature in the characters, whether virtuous, ordinary, or
vicious, every reader, with some experience of life, will recognise.
One of the most dramatic situations in it reminds the Baron of
an exactly similar scene in Mrs. Edwards' Morals of Mayfair,
where, in the latter, hero and heroine are caught by the rising of
the tide. In The Beth Book the heroine, with one of her tempo-
rary lovers, is also caught by the rising of the tide, and has a
very narrow escape.
Legend of Camelot, &c. (BRADBURY, AGNEw, & Co.), is
a genuine re-publication de lure of GEoRGE DU MAURIER's pic-
tures, poetry, and prose, that from time to time originally
*. in Mr. Punch's pages. The Legend of Camelot recalls
the maddest period of the “AEsthetic Craze,” when Messrs.
Maudle, Postlethwaite, & Co., a quite “too-too precious” set
of noodles, attitudinising, sighing, groaning, and moaning to
the last, received their coup de grâce from the sharp-pointed
I. and pen of our cynical artist, GEoRGE DU MAURIER. The
aughable Nursery Rhymes in the funniest French are illustrated
with a weird, grim-goblin humour that is best described as “Du-
Maurieresque”; while his “Society story,” of Mr. and Mrs. Jack
Spratt not only points a moral, but fº us just a pen-and-
inkling of the germs of the idea which, at a much later date,
was to come to fruition as Trilby. From a literary, as well as
from an artistic point of view, this volume is most welcome.

A Fancy Portrait of Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the Canadian Store.

IN MEMORIAM.
SIR CHARLES EDWARD POLLOCK.
“LAST of the Barons !” lo! the sudden call
Summons you hence across the silent land
To where at His Assize, the Judge of all,
Themselves, the judges of the earth must stand.
Not much shall then avail that legal art
Splendid, that set you other men above;
But much the record how with perfect heart
You learned and practised all the law of Love.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
By a notable coincidence, two novels, almost simultaneously
published, take recent historical epochs for their field, and for the
puppets of their plot borrow famous characters. In God Save the
Queen (CHATTo AND WINDUs), Mr. ALLEN Upward reveals a
hitherto unsuspected conspiracy that gathered round the QUEEN's
accession upon the death of WILLIAM THE FourTH. In For Love
of a Bedouin Maid (HUTCHINson), Le Volkus deals with the
time of NAPoleoN, dating from his unexpected return to Paris
after the Italian campaign, down to his final return to the capital
after Waterloo. It is a rattling story, full of strange adventure,
its hero, St. Just, having one of those charmed lives which distin-
uished Tom Burke of Ours, Charles O’Malley, and other of
EveR's heroes. In the chapters dealing with the search for the
hidden treasure in the subterranean Bedouin city, LE Woleur is
not beyond suspicion of having volé (conveyed, the wise call it)
from Mr. RIDER HAGGARD. ut sagacious reader will not
inquire too closely whence his good things are provided. As a
work of art, God Save the is more deftly wrought, Mr.

Question. What is the general impression
of the Public of the members of the Fire
Brigade?
Answer. That they are models of effi-
ciency and the bravest of the brave.
Q. Is this opinion justified by facts?
A. To a large extent. The men are all
that they should be, and if efficiency is not
complete, it is the fault of the authorities.
Q. Who are the authorities?
A. The members of the London County
Council.
Q. What is the record of this body as
regards the Fire Brigade?
A. That they contrived by their inter-
ference to lose the services of one of the
best of Superintendents, although they
were fortunate enough to secure the assist-
ance of a worthy successor.
Q. How do you know that the present
head of the Fire Brigade is a worthy suc-
cessor to his predecessor.
A. Because that is the opinion of the
predecessor, an opinion shared by the
Public at large.
Q. Has the Superintendent any chance
of distinguishing himself?
A. Scarcely; because the material with
which he has to work is ridiculously dis-
Q. Give an instance in support of this
statement.
A. A recent fire in the City absorbed
the entire stock of fire-engines available in
the Metropolis. Had there been another
large fire at the same moment, it would
have had to burn itself out free from the
representation of the L. F. B.
Q. Is not this a disgraceful state of
affairs?
A. Not only disgraceful, but ridiculous.
Q. Why is such a situation allowed to
continue P
A. Because the authorities are accus-
tomed to cheese-paring and luck.
Do you mean that so long as the
condition of affairs remains undiscovered
they will trust to chance to avoid disaster?
A. I do. For instance, in the matter of
the recent fire to which I have alluded,
luck stood their friend. The first con-
flagration exhausted the resources of the
L. F. B., but there was no second blaze of
the first order to complete the object
lesson.
Q. Still, attention was called to the
matter in the pages of the newspapers?
A. Certainly; and with the customary
benefit to the ..".
Q. Kindly explain what you mean by
“customary benefit.”
rivable from the schemes suggested during
a nine-days wonder.
Q. Are those schemes usually adopted?
A. No, they are not usually adopted,
and are ºis dropped when the wonder
of the nine days is succeeded by a marvel
of a fortnight later.
Q. Has not the recent fire also '.
to light a mass of circumlocution further
hampering the efforts of the firemen?
A. It É. and with great good luck,
something may be done to mend matters in
that connection.
Q. In what way?
A. By making it a rule to obtain coal
for the engines #. the nearest source of
supply, and improving the call machinery.
Q. But will that be enough P
A. Certainly not ; but it is the custom
of Englishmen to do things by halves, on
the principle that a moiety of a loaf is
preferable to no bread.
Q. But surely the public conscience is
now fully aroused?
A. Certainly; but, judging from prece-
dent, this does not amount to much.
Q. Make your meaning plainer.
A. The public conscience will be produc-

ODE TO AN OYSTER.
(By an amorous Bivalvian, who is blocked out
of the Counter at Luncheon-time.)
I LovE thee, gentle oyster; yet I ween
Thou knowest not thy lover or his mien.
Thou canst not know me, since I still await
Thy chaste arrival on the dubious plate,
And watch, with all but evident distress,
Vºl. who around thy charms still press,
ile I my love to thee may not yet tell
When quivering upon the deep, deep shell!
Think not, dear oyster, that I mean you ill
Because you do not satiate my will;
But recognise that my despair is utter
When, armed with stout and copious bread-
and-butter,
I may but take but little snacks and sips,
While ºns, love, to press you to my
lips
Come then, mine oyster, redolent of foam,
And Chili-vinegared or lemon-juiced, come
homel
Come home, mine oyster fair, come home!

THE PERIL OF POETRY. A NATIONAL SCANDAL.
DEAR MR. Punch,--I have read with much interest the
correspondence from eminent literary men which has recently
appeared in your columns, but I confess the idea of an Academy,
or as you more correctly name it, Ménagerie of Letters, has
quite lost favour with me since no single list that has yet
#. contains the name which is signed at the bottom of
this letter. This fact speaks volumes for the taste of the British
public, and, me judice, damns the scheme utterly.
I should iike, owever, to call your attention to a suggestion
made by a well-known contemporary of yours, from across the
Border. The Glasgow Herald, in a masterly article, advocates
“the State endowment of accredited poetical genius as a means
of preventing poetry from being starved out of existence”—
a fate, Sir, of which Poetry and I stand in direst danger.
And why? The Herald puts the whole case in a nutshell:
“There is not the same national demand for poetry that there
was thirty or forty years ago.” I go further. I say there is no
demand! Why, Sir, at the present moment I have twenty-three
epics lying in my desk, and } can't get one of them printed! It
is incredible, but true, and if you doubt it, I will send them to
85, Fleet Street (but regret I can't pay carriage) that you may
see for yourself. [We take your word for it.—ED.] I have
known people indignant because MILTON got but £5 for his
Paradise Lost. Lucky Milton' I can't get five pence, let alone
five pounds, for my Logrolliad, which, I consider infinitely
superior in every way to the mythico-theologico-metaphysical
lucubrations of the Puritan.
Now, Sir, you will, I know, agree with me that it would be a
H. calamity if Poetry and I should perish. How prevent it?

THE LADIES’ MILE.
“THERE's a tempting bit of greenery, of rus in urbe scenery”—
Its praises HENRY LEigh sang long ago;
Now we tell another story, for its undivided glory
Once departed, for a while, from Rotten Row.
In her never-failing passion for a novel hobby, Fashion
Made decree that riding bikes should be “the thing”;
Horses stayed at home unheeded, by the cycles superseded,
And the Row was then supplanted by the Ring.
There's a charming bit of “flat,” you know, between Achilles'
statue
And the Powder Magazine, which I shall style—
With a licence all poetic, and a note apologetic—
Yet with reason, too, I think—“The Ladies' Mile.”
Oh, the times that I have been there, and the types that I have
seen there
Of the real and imaginary swell,
And the scores of pretty riders, both patricians and outsiders,
Are considerably more than I can tell.
But of all things I remember one fine morning, in December,
Clear for ever in my memory must dwell,
When I leant against the railing watching skilful riders sailing
Up and down, and wobbling novices as well.
Then I brought away one image from that fashionable scrimmage
Of the sweetest and divinest little face,
\nd that vision of perfection in my constant recollection
In my thoughts and in my dreams will find a place.
Did I #. the little bounder in the train that gathered round
er
Did I look on his presumption as a crime?
She was smiling on him, sweetly, as she rode along so neatly,
Though she evidently loathed him all the time.
Oh, the hours that I have wasted, the regrets that I have tasted,
Since I saw her there for all too brief a while !
For the fact there's no concealing that she won my heart
a-wheeling
That December morn along the Ladies' Mile !
“”Tis AN ILL wind,” &c.--The recent gale will have had, it is
to be hoped, at least one good effect. The telegraphic communi-
cation between Calais and Dover ought to occupy only a few
minutes, and thus a message sent and received in so short a
time would avert a catastrophe. As a matter of fact, such a
message, instead of going straight to Dover, has to pass that
town and be taken up to London, and then, when all formalities,
whatever they may be, have been complied with, the message
is wired back again to Dover. On Monday, November >
according to the report in the Times, a telegram for Dover
despatched from Calais at 10.25 A.M., was not received at Dover
until 1.50 P.M. 11 This is an example of “how not to do it.”

AN INTERPRETATIo" -The following advertisement recently
uppeared in the Daily elegraph:—
“LAD, respectable, WANTED, used to vice and file.”
So here is to be found “some work,” as Dr. WATTs long ago
remarked, “for idle hands to do.” We know what "rank and
file” means; and here “vice” takes the º of “rank.”. Per-
haps “file” may be the slang equivalent for the French filer; if
so, the meaning evidently is that the lad accustomed to vice,
i.e., the vicious lad, must also be able, after committing the
vicious act, yeelpt of picking a pocket, to filer vite, that is, to
“cut and run.”

I now declare the session opened! Hoch!

In pure formality I ask the nation
To vote a thousand million marks.

But still it cost the service quite a strain
To mobilise so many on the main.

Due to an outrage on my German mission;

For vengeance in the form of quick returns,

And clears his beefy throat,
You learn—you would not otherwise—
That he's a man “of note.”

He constantly defeats you,
He will not let you pass him by—
However fine may be the voice
Which Heaven on him bestows,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Jorrocks, M.F.H., who was the Pickwick of the hunting field,
and the delightfully-original Soapy Sponge, both inimitably
illustrated by John LEEch, are a couple of sporting stories dith-
cult to rival and hard to beat. Mr. Fox RUssell, however—the
author's name has a decidedly sporting smack about it—comes for-
ward with The Haughtyshire Hunt (BRADBURY, AGNEw, & Co.), a
lively sporting story whose hero is nearer akin to Jorrocks than any
character the Baron remembers to have seen in sporting fiction.
And Mr. Russell has had the good luck to be associated with Mr.
R. J. Richardson, whose method of illustration is entirely his
own, whose accurately-drawn horses and riders in action are
“full of go,” but whose figures and situations are somewhat lack-
ing in the quality of humour. That the “toned” page illustrations
lose in effect as much as those in the Jorrocks and Soapy Sponge
series gain by their colour, will, the Baron thinks, be the opinion of
all who have the facilities at hand for making the comparison. Artis-
tically, the majority of the drawings,even where they are somewhat
hard, are admirable; while not a few of the single figures, as, for
instance, that of Will the huntsman, are, from every point of view,
except the humorous, perfect. . The sporting adventures of Mr.
Travers Algernon Binkie, from his first day's run with the Duke's
hounds, when he is mounted on Marmion, to his steeplechase
on The Roman, when Marmion, with Ronald Dennison up, wins,
are genuinely amusing; while the scene in the Law Courts is a
capital climax to the story. In his next sporting novel, the Baron
trusts that Mr. Fox Russell will carefully avoid the very old-
fashioned descriptive nomenclature which he has adopted for his
most farces, and in bills of the play at Christmas-time, when, in
order to swell the cast, the manager was wont to bestow humor-
ous names on a variety of “supers” and small people, who were
paid to be seen, but on no account to be heard, except
collectively.
The World gives a fully-illustrated Christmas Number, con-
taining two large pictures by Mr. BRYAN, crammed full of a lot
of persons representing, as usual, “celebrities,” who, on this
occasion, have not the air of appearing in the least “at home.”
The double illustration is accompanied by a list of these eminent
individuals; but it would have been more in keeping with
Christmas-time to have issued it as a sort of “puzzle-picture,”
and to have offered a prize to anyone who should guess correctly
the names of all the more-or-less celebrated individuals whose
likenesses the artist had intended to represent.
As to the cards which Father Christmas leaves on us when
he calls, there is quite an old-fashioned cheeriness of colour
about MARCUs WARD & Co.'s Christmas cards, and if “it is
humour you want,” as Mr. BRANDoN THoMAs used to say in The
Pantomime Rehearsal, it is provided in the liveliest varia-
tions. The calendars and almanacs tell the coming year in the
most artistic surroundings. Messrs. C. W. FAULKNER & Co.'s
cards take Christmas a little more seriously in their exquisite
platinotypes, of which some are worthy of a frame, and their
calendars, especially “The Minuet" series, make the days dance
in the “daintiest” possible fashion. If you ask this Firm, “What's
your little game at Christmas?” they will reply, “Oh, ever so many
novelties, including “Association Football,’ intended for draw-
ing-room amusement l” As this announcement will startle
characters, as, for example, “Haughtyshire,” “Fitzsquander,” grandmammas and domesticated elderly aunts, it is as well to

writes the indefatigable and undefeated Dickensian student,
Mr. PERcy FitzGERALD, in his latest book, entitled Pickwickian
Manners and Customs (Roxburghe Press, Limited), “and it is
still heartily appreciated.” True: it is “still heartily appre-
ciated” by those who enjoyed Pickwick when they were boys
together; the girls never cared for it; but among those of a
later time, dating, say, even so far back as the sixties, how
many are there who care about Pickwick & while among those
whose existence dates from 1878, for example, the Baron ques-
tions whether Mr. FITzGERALD will find one in thirty who may
have tried to read Pickwick and failed, and not one in fifty who
have “heartly appreciated” the immortal work. But, be this
as it may, Mr. PERCY FITzGERALD's book on Pickwickian Manners
and Customs will prove attractive and interesting to all who
love ... their Pickwick. He has started a theory, no less
plausible than ingenious, as to the probability that Boswell's
Life of Johnson to a certain extent inspired DICKENs in the
creation of Mr. Pickwick and his followers. To the Baron's
thinking, Mr. FITzGERALD's chapter on “Boz” and “Bozzy”
proves this beyond the possibility of doubt. The thanks of all
genuine Pickwickians are due to Mr. FitzGERALD for this notable
addition to the “Boz” classics.
My Baronutess informs me that Wild Kitty, by L. T. MEADE
(W. AND R. CHAMBERs), is a capital book for schoolgirls. Kitty
leaves the “ould coun ” to be educated in a select Englis.
school. The primness of the genteel Briton proves upsetting to
the Hibernian temperament, and this young lady, from a castle,
apparently in the backwoods, gets into many a scrape. The
“Hoorush l’ and the “shillelagh" are, however, actually not
among her accomplishments!

ings in ... magic and spells,” but, is a genuine golden man, who
eventually discovers himself at the correct moment as the long-
lost grandfather—“Which his name it was WALKER!” Good
name for a wandering grand-parent.
Princess Sarah, and Other Tales, by John STRANGE WINTEI.
(WARD, Lock & Co.), may possibly prove entertaining to the
ordinary “maid of bashful fifteen,” except that, perhaps, nowa
days, observes my Baronitess, “bashful fifteen’’ is extraordinary,
for whom something stronger and more exciting may be re-
quired. The stories are rather commonplace, which is Strange
for John W INTER.
“By the author of Tatterley,” set forth on the cover of a new
book, is a phrase to conjure with. In A Prince of Mischance
(HUTCHINson), Mr. ToM GALLoN has broken fresh ground. The
household in the Professor's home by the seaside is full of living
people, the Professor being a delightfully original person from
whose company we part all too soon. All the characters in the
story stand firmly forth, interest culminating in Evelyn. It
would not be fair even to hint at the lines of her story, on
the finely-conceived tragedy in which it closes. Readers of
Tatterley will find no disappointment in making the acquaintance
of the author's new essay. THE BARoN de B.-W.

It would be a pity not to rescue from oblivion such a delightful
jºinement as the following, which appears in the Church
17nes : —
“WANTED, two Ladies as Cook and HouseMAID, to share entire work of
North Country Seaside Vicarage. Two children and resident governess. Ii
salary required by both, state amount. Organ desirable in one.”
Surely no lady would require a salary for the privilege of
“sharing” the household duties in this charming retreat. An
occasional peep at the Bass Rock or Flamborough Head would
be ample remuneration combined with the delights of playing
the organ gratis, and possibly managing a choir, and feeling
that, after all, one was of some use in the world. Perhaps an
aggrieved baronet, or even a needy viscount, might be induced
to officiate as gardener-coachman for a similarly nominal salary
in this philanthropic establishment. The wonder is, that per-
sons in menial situations continue any longer to accept “wages.”
as well as hospitality in return for their services. Any right-
minded lady or nobleman could only construe such a pecuniary
offer as an insult to their birth and breeding. And in the
beautiful new century that is now a proaching, we expect that
individuals of whatever rank, even “generals,”. with any spark
of gratitude and good feeling, will pay their mistresses a hand-
some premium, in addition to an annual fee, for the comfort,
experience, distinction, and company of two children and a
resident governess obtainable in quiet north-country seaside
homes. What offers, ladies?

“Yes,” returned the senior Captain, “and since then we
have grown apace. Battalions all over the country, and a fair
force of artillery.”
“Yes,” assented a Subaltern. “Actually that branch of the
service became very popular on the introduction of noiseless
powder.”
“Talking of noise,” said the Colonel, “don’t you think we

NEW IMPERIAL “OCCUPATION.” "
THE GERMAN EMPERoR's SEVENth DEMAND IN HIs NoTE to THE
OHINEs E Gover NMENT is “ The Occupation of Kiao-Chau by
GERMANY. As A CoALING STATIow.” MR. PUNCH wishes WILLIAM,
KAISER AND CoAL-MERCHANT, EveRY success IN HIs “CoALING
BusinEss”—IF STRICTLY “LIMITED.”
IN RE–PINKERTON'S INSURANCE.
PART I.-How Mr. Briefless, Junior accepted a Reference.
“I AM going to ask you to do me a slight favour,” said PIN-
KERTON, “but if you grant it, it will confer a chronic blessing on
my whole life.”
I need scarcely say I was only too pleased to be of the slightest
service to PINKERTON. He occupies chambers beneath those
bearing my name (and others), and when I visit Pump Handle
Court I usually run across him. He is considerably my junior,
both in years and professional standing. This being so, I
thought it possible he might wish to consult me.
“If you desire my counsel on the conduct of a consent
brief ”I began.
“Oh, no, it’s nothing of that sort,” interrupted my learned
friend. “The fact is, as I am going to be married I want to
insure my life.”
“A very proper thing to do,” I said, heartily. “When under-
taking the responsibilities of the married state, which are, in
reality, bound . an expressed contract, it is desirable xx
“Yes, yes,” again interrupted PINKERTON, “I know all that,
but the fact is, in your unprofessional capacity I want you to do
me a favour.”
I was a little annoyed at my learned friend's tone. º
I do not appear in the Courts quite so frequently as I did in the
days of my hot youth—yet as recently as shortly before the long
vacation I was briefed to support an application for the appoint-
ment of a receiver in chambers—I am regarded, and I think
rightly regarded, as a legal authority of weight in the bosom of
my family. My maiden aunt, CARoline ADELAIDE, invariably
consults me before adding (she has added several), a codicil to
her will, and as for Uncle JAck—a most vigorous old gentleman
of ninety-four—he keeps me quite busily employed in reading
his letters to the Urban Council. My maiden Aunt, CAROLINE

*..." on the probable validity of a legacy left to a parrot, and
ncle JACK was equally thankful when I prevented him from
sending, as a privileged communication, his opinion in writing
the U. C. anent the District Surveyor that that
individual was a “blithering idiot,” and what was worse—from
a legal point of view—“tip receiver.” Uncle JACK agreed with
me, on recovering from his attack of gout, that his “privileged
communication” would probably have landed him in olloway.
So I repeat, I was displeased with PINKERTON's tone—it savoured
of disrespect.
“I am nothing if not professional,” I said, with a grave
smile. “Of course, I shall be only too pleased to serve you.”
“Well, it's only to become my surety. The medical Johnny
who examined me said I was right enough, but he must have a
form filled in by a friend of some years' standing before he could
recommend his board to accept me.”
“I see,” I returned. “I shall be very happy, but I am bound
to say that I shall have to answer the questions put me with the
nicest regard as to their truthfulness.”
“I expect nothing less,” said PINKERTON, in rather a nasty
tone. “Of course, my dear fellow, I don't want you to tell a
pack of lies, but still, if you have any hesitation about it I can
easily get George or 'Purne Porte to Tº
“Not at all,” I replied, promptly. I don't like DE PUTRE
Potte. He suggests to my mind a donkey suffering from ex-
aggerated self-complacency. And the matter was settled.
“You might give me a int or two,” I continued. “How did
you get on with the examining doctor?”
“What, the medical Johnny ? Oh, first rate.
me, and said I was satisfactory to an ounce.”
I was a little surprised at this, as PINKERtoN is distinctly
thin. I myself am only fifteen stone to five feet nine, and I am
certainly portly as compared with my learned friend.
“Then he punched me in the chest and listened with a thing
like one of those theatrical telephone-tubes to hear the echoes.”
“And was the condition of your lungs to his satisfaction?”
“Eminently—he said I was as sound as a bell. Then he made
me hop about the room on one leg like a demented duck.”
“I see. No doubt to test the muscles of your foot.” I have
some knowledge of anatomy.
“Probably. Then he listened for the music again, and de-
clared my heart to be perfection. I was very pleased, as, to
tell the truth, I had rather worried myself by reading The
Dictionary of the Incurable, by Doctor ZERO.”
“Unquestionably a text-book of commanding importance.”
“So } thought until I found that I had the symptoms of fifteen
fatal diseases, of which two thirds should terminate abruptly
within a week.”
“I need scarcely say that your apprehension was not
realised?”
examiner.
“You are perfectly right in that assumption. I am still alive,
and if I may believe the medical Johnny, have no need to make
my will for the next twenty years. In fact, as the doctor bade
He weighed
me adieu, he predicted that I would be on the books of the com-
pany until I was eighty.”
“Distinctly satisfactory.”
“So I thought. So, my dear fellow, when the form arrives,
fill it in according to the dictates of your conscience.”
“That I assuredly will,” I returned, heartily, as I wrung
ºntos'. hand warmly. “I am confident that all will be
well.
“I would be grieved beyond measure if I did not share in that
belief,” said my learned friend. “ALICE is the dearest girl alive.”
And then PINKERtoN gave me a detailed account of how,
when, and where he had met his fiancée, and other details—
from his point of view—of an interesting character. At length
he left me, and I turned my attention to my notes upon a book
I contemplate writing some day, to be called, From the Gown of
the Student to the Chancellor's Wig, with the sub-title of The
Erperiences { a Practising Barrister, when my admirable and
excellent clerk Poh TINGToN entered the room.
“I think, Sir, this is something more than a circular,” he said:
I allow my valued assistant a certain latitude in the selection of
documents to be destroyed or preserved.
“Thank you,” I replied, and then I opened an envelope bear-
ing a type-written name and address. I glanced at the con-
tents. * form to be filled in about the health of PINKERTON.
I read the questions more carefully, and my mind became much
disturbed. They were distinctly of an embarrassing character.
How I replied to them, and what was the effect of my answers
must be reserved for another chapter.

SONGS FOR THE NATION.
“Anybody may make the laws of a nation, let
me make its songs.”—Shakspeare, or Somebody.
Drinking Songs.-The drinking song is
a necessity of human nature, but a great
deal may be done to guide it (the song)
into proper channels. I would catch the
thoughtless with guile by preserving the
time-honoured tone, while pointing out a
more excellent way. Notice the sort of
crescendo in moral purpose which culmi-
nates in the third verse of the specimen
given. When singing this song, proceed
warily, and omit the third verse if you
observe symptoms of discontent. It may
even be advisable to stop short at the first,
but be assured that the serious element
must prevail in the long run.
BAccHANALIAN.
Come, jolly topers, one and all,
Together we will stand or fall,
Fill up the radiant bowl with wine,
And lemonade that's half divine:
Our hearts are light, our spirits free,
So here's to you and here's to me.
Chorus.
Every man-jack of us reeling with iollity,
Now is the moment for utter frivolity,
Not to be jolly is most reprehensible,
Hang any villain who dares to be sensible!
Gaze on the liquor surpassingly fair,
Drink of the claret-cup radiant and rare,
Hurrah!
But lo! amid our frantic cheers
A medicated wine appears.
A tonic is a thing of might,
Of ecstacy and pure delight.
The finest drugs, the choicest steel
To every British heart appeal.
Chorus.
Wine that is useful for gout and paralysis,
Wine that has stood every test of analysis,
Wine that will save you from hopeless
inanity,
Ring out its praise to the verge of insanity,
Fie on the fogies who call you a beast,
Drink to the dregs half-a-teaspoon at least !
Hurrah!
Encore verse.
What, ho! The tonic, too, retires,
And “pales its ineffectual fires”
Before the very prince of drinks,
From which the nerveless milksop shrinks.
No heel-taps, boys, mock care and toil
In lovely Norway's golden oil!
Chorus.
Cod liver oil, boys' oh, the delight of it!
Cod liver oil' we will all make a night of it !
Cod liver oil' it is making a man of you,
Phosphates are good for the whole jolly
clan of you,
Weak little stomachs may turn from the

We will insist upon having it neat.

'INTS ON 'UNTING, BY ARRY.
Sit well BAck At You it FENCEs.
SEASONABLE LITERATURE.
The LAST CHAPrer of A ChrisTMAs
NUMBER. (1837)
“HARRY,” said Sir JASPER, with a sob
strangely foreign to his wonted lack of
feeling, “you must forgive me. I don't
deserve it, I know. Through forty-seven
pages my ingenious schemes have kept you
and your MARY apart, and if that missing
will hadn't turned up, I should have won
the game. But you won't be hard on a
poor old villain, HARRY, my boy? There's
unmoved by the sound of church bells in
the last chapter. I forgive you, and MARY
forgives me, and we forgive everybody
else, and it's away with melancholy, and
up with the holly, and let's be jolly;
There's only a page more to fill, and we’ll
end the story in the proper way. To-night
will the dear old Hall re-echo with mirth
and happiness, and the elders will unbend
and become young again. Excuse me now.
We dine at six, and I must drink a gallon
of milk-punch before then.”
only a page or two more, so you can afford
to be generous. And, if my words are
weak, that sound will reach your heart—
the sound of Christmas bells!”
He flung open the window as he spoke,
and the chimes from the sweet old village
church sounded merrily across the snow-
covered fields.
“JAsPER,” answered HARRY, in impres-
sive tones, “I forgive you. If, indeed, I
followed my natural inclination, I should
throw you out of window.
“I thank you!” cried Sir JASPER. “Now
that you've foiled all my schemes, I was
sure you'd forgive me. My regards to
Miss MARY, and after a few glasses of hot
brandy-and-water, I'll step round to the
Hall.”
And that night they revelled in the most
thorough-going style. All of them were
there, the hero HARRY, and the heroine
MARY, and the villain JASPER, together
with the old-fashioned uncle, the humorous
mother-in-law, and lots of other characters
who have been mentioned incidentally in
But no true the story, and long since forgotten. Every
Christmas revel. And there was roast beef,
and mistletoe, and Sir Roger de Coverley,
and snapdragon, and blind-man's buff, and
ghost stories, and love-making, and, above
all, gallons and gallons of punch. Not till
every drop of the latter was finished did
the company disperse. Finally they left
in pairs, to be married next morning, and
to live happily ever after, which is the only
proper way of finishing up an old-fashioned
Christmas number.
THE SAME Chapter. (1897.)
At the window of the foulest garret in
the slums of London (for full description,
vide previous pages), HARRY the hero stood
and twiddled his thumbs. With a languid
interest he watched a cat in the yard
lick its paw, and miaow twice. Then he
turned to his companion and regarded him
curiously.
“JASPER,” he said, with a yawn, “don’t
you think we might as well end somewhere
here?”
“Just as you like,” answered JASPER,
who was sitting on a dust-heap in the far
corner. “It really doesn't matter where
we stop in a story of this kind, one place
does as well as another.”
“There isn't much to go on with,” re-
plied HARRY, thoughtfully chewing a piece
of string. “Now that you’ve murdered
MARY, and all the others are disposed of,
it's about time to finish. I can't go on
talking to you for many more pages.”
“Why not P” JASPER replied. “We can
always fill up the gaps with “dreary
silences.” Surely you don't hate me?”
HARRY signed. “Nobody hates in
modern stories—that is far too strong an
emotion. But, as you’ve killed my fiancée,
besides murdering three other characters,
and driving five more to suicide, I do
slightly dislike you. Here's the poison
bottle, and there's just enough left for us
both. You're sure none of the others are
left out by mistake? How about that
costermonger mentioned on the second
oage?”
“Sent to penal servitude,” responded
JASPER. “And his wife has gone mad in
•onsequence, and killed off three minor
characters who weren't accounted for. As
you say, we may as well stop ; we’ve pro-
vided a snlendid storv for a modern Christ-
mas number. Pass the poison bottle when
you’ve taken your share. And don’t forget
to make a vague remark just before you
die—readers expect it.”
HARRY nodded, and having consumed a
pint of pure prussic acid, handed the re-
mainder to JASPER, who quickly swallowed
the rest.
For a few moments there was silence.
Then HARRY sat up.
“Why didn't he boil the butter?” he
murmured.
Then there was a dreary silence.

ALL THE DIFFERENCE.-The Daily News
published an article, which, under the title
of “Rowing and Rowing Men,” reviewed
the fourth volume of the Isthmian Library,
by Messrs. R. C. LEHMANN, GUY NICKALLs,
and others, under, the able editorship—or
editorboat, in this instance—of Mr. B.
FLETCHER Robinson. There is a Crum of
comfort in it for Etonians; and E. G.
BLACKMore interests us in Australian
eights. But the title of the book is mis-
leading, for “Rowing and Rowing Men”
suggests a comparison between “the Row-
ing Men” or “Rowdies” of a past gene-
ration and the temperate and quiet Rowing

hero in a Christmas number was ever yet one of them turned up for the old-fashioned
Men, i.e., oarsmen, of to-day.

MR. JOHN MORLEY ENTERS THE HOUSE
AFTER A course of DEpoRTMENT AND THE CULTIVATION of AN
AFFABLE MANNER.
[“Gentlemen, a short time ago afriend of mine, who sits on our Benches in
the House of Commons, complained that those who, like myself, have the de-
lightful privilege of sitting on the front Bench, “dwelt like stars apart.'
(Laughter.) Ever since I read this reproach I have been endeavouring to
cultivate the graces, the want of which my honourable friend complained—
the graves of affability and accessibility, which, as Nature may have stinted me,
I have endeavoured to cultivate up to what I may almost say is an art.ficial
point. (Laughter.)"—From Mr. J. Morley's speech at Bristol, Dec. 9..]
“WANTED !”
HAPPILY it is true that the good men do lives after them.
The memory of Mr. Punch's friend, and the friend of man,
MonTAGUE WILLIAMs, is kept green by the Blanket and Clothing
Fund he established whilst he presided over the Worship Street
Police Court. This is designed to comfort at Christmas-time,
with clothing, boots, and blankets, poor families resident in the
urlieus of the Court. Worship Street Police-Court area includes
ethnal Green, Shoreditch, Spitalfields, Hoxton, part of Old
Ford, and part of Whitechapel. Which is a perhaps prolix, cer-
i. conclusive, way of saying that the poorest of the poor of
London shiver in its shadow. Last Christmas, through the
beneficent agency of the Fund, five hundred families received
timely help. This year, Mr. Punch's circle can easily go five
hundred better. Walk up, ladies and gentlemen, walk W. with
your ready-money, delivered to the Magistrates at orship
Street, Mr. HADEN Conser and Mr. A. R. CLUER, or, with gifts
of clothing, to the Depot, 20, Albion Road, Dalston, addressed
to Mr. John MAssey, missionary at the Court.
THE HUNT BALL.—“Ah, yes, I know him,” observed the in-
telligent foreigner; “ze great national game of feetballs, which
all ze Engleesh ladies play on ze links.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE royal game of golf, says my Baronitess, has a fascination
culiarly its own, but according to Colonel Bogey's Sketch Book,
y ANDRE (LoNGMANs, GREEN & Co.), “that way madness lies.”
Certainly the pictures are somewhat nightmareish, and the
accompanying sundry after-dinner sayings of the Colonel are
a trifle confoozling, as Captain Crosstree, “which it was his
name,” was wont to observe.
Just Forty Winks (BLACKIE AND SoN), by HAMISH HENDRY,
daintily illustrated by GERTRUDE BRADLEY, which is an eye-
º for the little ones, who will enjoy the amazing adventures
of Davie Trot down the long lane that has so many turns in
dreamland.
An Alphabet, by WILLIAM NICHolson, published by WILLIAM
HEINEMANN, is grimly and gruesomely attractive. It should
have a large circulation after the Christmas festivities are over,
when the doomed ones of Dyspepsia will thoroughly enjoy
these pictures.
Mrs. DE LA PASTURE's last book, Deborah of Tod's (SMITH,
ELDER), is the best novel my Baronite has read since the days
began to shorten. One is interested from the first by desire to
see how one of the most audacious plots in modern fiction can
be reasonably worked out. There is nothing new in contrasting
the simplicity and genuineness of rural life with the artificiality
of . London Society. The enterprise is carried to a perilous
point when we have a septuagenarian General, K.C.B., a member
of the inner circle of London Society, plopping into marriage
with a girl who works upon her own farm, talks in Devonshire
dialect, has been little to school and never outside her own parish.
That she should not only acquit herself well in the new scenes
to which her marriage introduces her, but that, by reason of her
nobility of character, her purity of soul, her sound common sense,
she should dominate the circle and finally marry a much-run-after
Peer of the realm, form a group of propositions that seem im-
possible to establish. So perfect is Mrs. DE LA PASTURE's skill,
so infinite her resources, that all these things seem to follow as a
matter of course. She is equally at home with humanity in
country and in town. Deborah is delightful, whilst the less un-
common Society people with whom she for a while lives are
drawn with light, firm, unerring touch. We seem to know them
all, but only in one instance does Mrs. DE LA PAsture obviously
draw from life. There is no mistaking the trade-mark of the
butterfly about Mr. Corella.
Even in these days of artistic editions de lure it is rare to find
such prodigality bestowed on, a reproduction of the work of a
black-and-white artist as is displayed in the handsome volume,
printed at The Whitefriars Press for T. Fish ER, UNwiN and
BRADBURY, AGNEw, & Co., entitled, The Work of Charles Keene,
with a most interesting introduction and useful running com-
mentary by Joseph PENNELL. The volume also contains a
bibliography of the books KEENE illustrated, and a catalogue of
his etchings. Of the remarkable examples of work that may be
generally termed “variations” on his original, style, there are
some that, without the signature, might have been set down to
George du MAURIER ; and there are others that would puzzle
any expert as to whose artistic handiwork he should, off-hand,
assign it. In all this collection there is one that stands abso-
lutely alone; it is a “Wash drawing probably made for the
Illustrated London News.” “It is,” says Mr. PENNELL, “very
like the work of RAFFET or CHARLET"; and, we may add diffi-
dently, it strongly reminds us of MEIssonIER and of Gustave
DoR.E." But while it “reminds” us of these artists in their treat-
ment of similar subjects, in stands entirely apart, not only from
any suggestion of imitation of any other artist's style and
method, but also from all other specimens of KERNE's work in
this collection. As Mr. PENNELL here notes, “Each little figure
is instinct with life, movement, and character.” As to women, it
is evident that KEENE could draw a pretty and a handsome face,
also an elegant form; but as to costume, very rarely was he in
touch with the fashions of the day. He could not approach
Leech in depicting a “swell”; while, on the other hand, his
tradesmen, writers, clergy of the old school, his labourers, and
ancient village gossips male and female, are perfect types. In
the matter of “legs” (see p. 161), his study of “an inebriate” is
marvellous; but somehow or another he never succeeded in giving
us Mr. MILLIKEN’s “'Arry.” It was CHARLEs KEENE’s “ 'Arry.”
Then the sketches of landscapes are lovely. But in the company
of Mr. PENNELL, with the majority of whose criticisms we agree,
we could linger for hours over a book, which, it is a pleasure,to
know, will soon be in the hands of all sincere admirers of this
great artist's work. THE BARon DE B.-W.

hrow in a
flat race and three or four
easily-negotiated hurdle-matches, and there
isn't much difference, after all! Oh! those
hurdles, which my friends the B. W.'s per-
sist in calling “obstacles”!
Why, time
after time I’ve seen a flat-racing horse run
through them, and disdain to lift himself,
when he encountered the supposed check
to his progress. The only time that I ever
remember a hurdle being a hindrance to
any competitor, was once at Sandown,
when an animal, having “rushed ” the
barrier, caught it with his heels and landed
it on the head of the jockey of a near
opponent. Believe me, that in Practice, if
not in Theory, there is but little to choose
between Flat-racing and Hurdle-hopping,
and the fact that Newmarket has taken
up the game is a very solid proof of my
assertion.
You will observe that I have not included
chases and Steeplechases, just as there are
Oysters and Oysters. One of the latter,
with a Noah's Ark habitation, and a beard
worthy of advertising a Petroleum Hair
Restorer, is no more to be compared
with a beauteous Whitstable or Colchester
Native than is a supposed Steeplechase
Course, with finnikin fences and a duck-
puddle water-jump, to the magnificent
country over which the Grand National is
determined. The way in which some of
these steeple-tracks are made without
steeples is occasionally delightful. Not
very many years since, I was going over a
course before a meeting, when the Great
Mogul of the gathering observed with
infinite satisfaction to his little court of
followers, “You will observe, gentlemen,
that we have strictly avoided using barbed
wire!” And I give you my word that not
one of the Pomponius Egoes of the party
detected the exceedingly enjoyable jape.
And again, every farmer with a few
acres of unprofitable land thinks that it
would make a fine terrain for “lepping.”
I knew a Gentle Agriculturist with three
quarters of a mile of bog at his disposal,
who invited a Well-known Sportsman to
inspect the same, paying all his expenses
from London. “Well,” cried the Bucolic
after their tramp, “what do you think o
it?” “I think,” replied the Scientist,
without the slightest smile, “that you
must have been thinking of a regatta, not
a Steeplechase meeting.” They never
spoke again.
I may not expatiate on all these matters
to-day, but, as the Bard says, “There is a
to-morrow.” He might also have added,
that an indifferent time at the fair town
of Leicester (where factory girls and Stil-
ton cheeses appear to vie with one another
in multitude) laced me in the unenvi-

RESEARCHES IN ANCIENT SPORTS,
A LITTLE GAME IN Pompilius's BILLIARD Room.
LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
No. WI.--To MR. ANDREw LANG.
MY DEAR SIR,--To the foot of the heights whence you dis-
tribute the wreaths of praise and the bolts of blame I venture
to bring this humble letter. I beg you will not thunder upon
me if I rouse you for a moment from some dream of airy ghosts
to be embodied in yet another volume that shall grapple with
the elusive manifestations of the world beyond our vision. What
gadfly has stung you that you should thus devote your pleasant
learning to the pursuit of these silly stories, these second-sight
absurdities retailed at third hand, these vaporous shapes that
speak. of fate and death to minds overwrought by a morbid
brooding, that point to the accomplished inevitable, nor hint
!. should they?) in what fashion it may be undone or avoided ?
ou, Sir, whose literary style has so greatly captured our ad-
miration as to have extorted the ºf of a first prize amongst
moderns from that not too placable censor, Mr. QUILLER Couch,
are fitted to hunt for a nobler quarry. Leave Julia and her
brood (the word requires a phantasmal apology, since Julia was
in life a spinster lady and ağ. to journalism), leave her, I
say, to her creator and protégé, Mr. W. T. STEAD. If she fails,
souse, into your ink-pot, or sprawls and scrawls across your
writing-paper, how shall she hold the pen of STEAD or indite
unctuous blessings to mankind when Borderland shall once more
have lapsed from a happy suspense into woful publication? No,
let her still be STEAD's own. For you, if you will, there are
other pursuits. If you will, I say. But will you? Of what
avail is it to cry to you, desine pervicar, if, with your eyes
fº you still persist in straying amongst these tangled weeds?
If I should tell you (far from me be the presumption) that you
not only fool away your time, but that you incur the
censure pronounced by the French king on those who fooled
without making him laugh—the quotation is, no doubt, familiar
time is his own to fool away if he likes, and that, as at present
advised, you prefer psychic research to poetry and even to
criticism or leading articles on American writers in the columns
of the Daily News. Well, every man to his taste, say I. And
I must admit that your taste has been catholic. You have
rhymed most musically. Though the sum of your verse is small,
there is in it a perfect little note of true poetic feeling never
forced beyond the bounds that style and an academic culture
point out. Others, greatly daring, may venture on a wild wrong
word, and find that is absolutely right and tamed to the measure
of poetry. You have picked and chosen with a precise care, and
your lines sometimes lose in strength as much as they gain in
polish. But they have a haunting and delightful melody, and
often speak straight to the heart. And how versatile you have
been. y, criticism, short story, leading article, folk-lore, lite-
rary gossip, verse—in all these you have shone and still shine. You
have paddled along the little rivers that flow into the great stream
of history, have lingered with Pretenders, false and true, and have
exhibited to posterity the hateful faces of forgotten spies. , Nor
must it be forgotten that you have written a long poem—it fills
a whole volume—on Helen of Troy, and have wrought the same
lady into a novel, written in collaboration with Mr. RIDER
HAGGARD. You, at least, as you review your career and your
work have no reason to despond. It is not for you to pose as
the homme incompris of your generation. You have, I suppose,
done what you wanted, and have done it as you wished to do it.
What more can a man require of his life? If you have not
gained the brightest chaplets, the reason is that you have not
striven for them, and have not cared to strive. But, if the
humour should take you, there is yet time for immortality,
provided you can bring yourself to abandon for a space, your
curious prying into the speech and manners of deceased per-
sons. With your dispute against Professor MAx MULLER, I
need not concern myself. These matters are too steep for the

the wherefore of his language, his manners and his religion, being
content on the whole to accept the fact of their existence as
being amply sufficient for ordinary purposes.
Your position, then, is an enviable one, and you occupy it
because you have fairly earned it. Without being “bland,
passionate, and deeply religious,” you are cultivated, academic,
and sarcastic. Generally, too, you are urbane, humorous, and
even genial. Now and then, it is true, a gust of perverse temper
shakes you, you drop the rapier, and, lo, some unfortunate head
cracks to the blow of your bludgeon. I must add, too, that
you have your fair share of that very human failing, resent-
ment, and those who can recognise your style are sometimes
amused when here and there the spretae injuria formae crops up
in your writings. But is there one of us so virtuous and forgiving
as not to j. at times in a sly thrust at those who have done

literary man, and you take pride in your calling. You have
added greatly by your writings to the sum of our pleasure;
you maintain the dignity of journalism no less than the honour
of literature. Yet you are not of those who call out for titles or
swagger ostentatiously because Heaven and your inclination
made you a writing man. I am, Sir, Your faithful servant,
THE WAGRANT.
A LITERARY NIGHTMARE.
[“The heroine is steadily departing from English fiction.”—Mr. W. L. Alden,
in “Parson's Magazine” for December.]
My study-door was flung open, and, to my astonishment, a
crowd of ladies entered. All of them were fairly young, though
they were dressed in every possible variety of costume, and all
of them seemed to be in a state of considerable excitement.
“May I ask,” I inquired, timidly, “to what I owe the pleasure
of seeing you here?” - - -
“Certainly you may,” replied one of them, brandishing a
magazine as she spoke. “We have called in consequence of a
disgraceful statement published in this journal. We are all
popular heroines, who up to the present have found, constant
employment in English ction. But now it appears that there
is a conspiracy afoot to get rid of us, and in consequence, we are
calling upon various novelists to ascertain their intentions to-
wards us. Do you propose to exclude us from your novels in
future?”
Before I could reply, a beautiful girl in a white, ball-dress
pushed her way to the front, and addressed me in tearful
accents : —
“It is too bad!” she sobbed. “I am the most popular
heroine of all, and have delighted countless readers. I am just
nineteen, you know, and the most charming girl in the whole
world the hero always tells me so. We sit out several dances
together in the conservatory, and while he explains how he has
adored me through a couple of hundred pages, I turn away
nervously and pull a rose to pieces. I must have destroyed
thousands of roses in my time. Then, when he misinterprets my
silence and says, in a voice trembling with emotion, that he
knows he doesn't deserve my love, I gasp out his Christian name
and he folds me in his manly arms. nd then we get married
in the last chapter and live happily ever after. Readers never
tººl of me, and yet I’m to be turned out with no work
to do
She seized a rose from her dress and began to pull it to pieces
as she spoke. A tall, dark girl took her place.
“And how about me?” she demanded. “Aren't you going
to use me any more ? I am the mysterious, passionate heroine
who always fascinates the best kind of hero. I am all soul.
After dinner I sing weird songs in a way that astonishes every
one, and then the hero and I walk out into the moonlight and
listen to the nightingale together. Frequently I talk about the
H. of existence, and the weary irony of life. I can fill a
ozen pages at a time in that way. But beneath my lº uid

Sometimes I marry the hero, but more often I die; my death-
scene is simply concentrated essence of the very best pathos.
And even if I am a little bit old-fashioned, readers like me as
much as ever. You had better remember my volcanic passion
if you propose to cashier me, you miserable scribbler l’”

reader heedeth that Dost think, º: that I am to be driven

“The fact of the matter is,” cried another lady, who wore a
hard felt hat, a bicycling skirt and gaiters, and who had helped
herself unasked to one of my cigarettes, “that we aren't so soft

may put your bottom dollar on that. Why, what’s to become
of your huntin' and racin' yarns if you leave me out?”
At last there was a moment's pause, and, having barricaded
myself behind the sofa, I attempted to speak.
“Ladies!” I exclaimed, “I respect you sincerely—I do, indeed.
All of you are old friends of mine, and I’ve found posts for most
of you in one or other of my novels. But what is a poor writer
to do? The novel with a heroine is becoming unfashionable,

Vienna.-Arrive about eight. After supper at the hotel, what
is to be done? Too late for any theatre. Just take a stroll in
the streets. In the Ring-Strasse, of course, here at the very
door. On such a fine evening the Paris Boulevards would be
crowded. Even Piccadilly, or $: Street, Edinburgh, would
not be deserted. Have always understood that Vienna is quite
unlike London or Edinburgh; that it is as gay as Paris. ow
pleasant! I will walk out and see all the fun, here in this part
of the Ring-Strasse, the part nearest to the Opera, the Boulevard
des Capucines of Vienna should perhaps assume a jaunty air,
suited to the place. Must not look like a weary American, or
a bored English tourist. Might put my hat a little on one side,
if I were sure that that ...if be correct in Vienna. Can
arrange this when I see how the other men in the crowd wear
their hats. So, merely lighting a cigarette, and giving an extra
twist to my moustache, I stroll into º street.
I am absolutely alone! From end to end there isn't a soul
besides me! Come to that, I don't know which is the end, for
the street is so monstrously wide that the width and the length,
in this segment of the circle, are about the same. But neither
across, nor along the street can I see any one. The Boulevard
des Capucines of Vienna, at half-past nine on a fine October
evening, is quieter than Portland Place at midnight on Sunday.
My moustache untwists itself, and my hat slips towards the
back of my head. Could walk here in flannel, without being
noticed. Keep along by the houses, and reach the immense space
by the Opera. It is as deserted as Salisbury Plain. Only
Salisbury Plain is not covered with huge cobble-stones, and pools

Venice, Vienna; nice quiet places for nervous invalid.
Suddenly, terrific noise, clatter of hoofs and wheels. As yet
I see nothing. Must be fire-engine. Suddenly, round a corner,
at a fearful pace, comes two-horse cab. It rattles over these
cobble-stones, and stops at Opera House. Others come, with
equal noise, and I see dark figures slip out from the great build-

Question. You have joined the army with
a view to distinguishing yourself in the
annals of your country?
Answer. Not exactly; although no doubt
I liked the idea of wearing a red coat, and
belonging to a service once commanded by
MARLBoRough and WELLINGTON.
Q. I see by your reply that you have
some education ?
A. Yes, thanks to the School Board.
Q. Then could you not employ your time
to better purpose than drill in the barrack
square .." beer in the canteen P
A. Possibly; although nowadays learn-
ing is rather a drug in the market. So I
joined, for, at the moment, I had nothing
better to do.
Q. And I suppose that your comrades
were rolling stones like yourself?
A. You may take it that most of us
belonged to the ne'er-do-well class.
Q. And what do you expect from your
connection with the army?
A. A few years of comparative comfort,
and then compulsory retirement.
Q. But will not your service with the
colours assist to get civil employment on
your retirement?
No ; because, during my stay in the
technical knowledge of the craft I might
like to adopt.
Q. You mean that non-army men would
have an advantage over you in this
respect?
A. Certainly; and this would also be
true anent the obligation of the reservist.
Q. What is that obligation?
A. At a call from headquarters to desert
all civil employment to join his old regi-
ment.
Q. Does this interfere with the obtain.
ment of civil º:
A. Undoubtedly; and consequently ser.
vice in the army is a doubtful blessing.
Q. Why is it a doubtful blessing?
A. Because a youngster is taken for a
few years into a service that can only teach
him the discipline of endurance, and then
sent adrift to compete with men who have
; learning their trades from their child-
ood.
Q. Then why do you enlist?
A. Because there is nothing better to
do in the present, and as for the future, it
must look after itself.

A PREVIOUS QUESTION.
[“We are sorry to see that something like a con-
tention is arising as to what shall be the ‘foremost
and immediate object' of the Liberal Party. . . .
Whether the Lords can be attacked with any pro-
spect of success out of the ewigkeit, so to speak, is a
very serious question. ... The first business, how-
ever, if we º venture to remind the party of so
very practical a consideration, is to obtain a
majority.”—Westminster Gazette.]
THE Liberal hens sat on their eggs,
It was a solemn sight;
Their brows were knit, their eyes were lit
With a strange prophetic light;
Their beaks came out beyond the bars
Sniffing the ewigkeit.
Some of them sat so deep in thought
They never said a word;
The Monmouth brand on the other hand
Occasionally purred;
And a pleasant fiow of badinage
Fell from the Birrell-bird.
The Durdans fowl was well aware
She was warming lumps of stone;
And the Montrose Pet had got a set
Of Gaelic ducks on loan;
But the Bantam-hen from Battersea

And it went .#.
Their fancies ran on a likely plan
For making chickens grow ;
On a programme pointing out the way

“Home Rule,” said one, “is what they
want,
As I observed before.”
By this she stuck with a steady cluck,
And even slightly swore ;
But the others lifted up their bills
And called the bird a bore.
Another said: “At certain sins
No parent ought to blink;
Let us not pause in passing laws
To localise the Drink.”
But the others looked a little shy,
And one was seen to wink.
At this the Bantam opened out
With a proletariat snort:
“I’d train 'em to bust the upper-crust,
The bloated birds of sport l”
But the more respectable muttered
“Pooh 1”
Which cut the Bantam short.
Then one in Henhood's name ºduced
A notion to serve their need;
The same would enhance their chickens'
chance
And check their neighbours' greed:—
“One bird, one crop : one crop, one grain!”
And they all said: “Good, indeed!”

That knew the ropes and rings:

By way of preface a useful move
Would be to hatch the things.”

A Poetical Young Person is inditing an effusion
to his fancied Mistress, when he receives a
coldly-worded missive.
ITHought that we were friends that night,
Or something else, or something else!
You filled my heart with sweet delight,
Or something else, or something else!
Your lips were telephones to me,
The while your eyes made mine to see,
I fancied all that you might be
Of something else, of something else!
I thought that we’d together roam
In somewhere else, in somewhere else!
But everywhere should be our home
In somewhere else, in somewhere else!
By sunny waters, unknown seas,
"Mid everlasting blooms and trees,
You, only you, I'd slave to please,
In somewhere else, in somewhere else!
You never should your power lose,
And somewhat else, and somewhat else!
Yours be the right to pick and choose,
And somewhat else, and somewhat else!
Yours be the voice to guide our way,
You to command and I obey,
You be the “Yea,” not I the “Nay,”
And somewhat else, and somewhat else!
In praise of you I'd use a ream,
For no one else, for no one else!
Reality’s in you a dream,
In no one else, in no one else!—

I read between the lines, you've met
A Word FRoM THE CRACKERIEs.—A reli-
able recipe from our own Crackery book on
how to make a Christmas evening go off
as it should in the crackiest, cheeriest
method. First, deck the board in all the
tinselled graces from “The Artistic Table
Decorations,” then, under the blue light
of the “X Rays,” the marvels of “The
Cinematographe" can be mixed with sea-
sonable fare from “Relics of the North,”
trifles left by NANSEN's bears. Most di-
gestible ! Though possibly, after devouring
“The Christmas Stories,” “Goblins,” as
the pervading spirit of festivity, may haunt
one's dreams. No matter, with such in-
redients, served as they are by Tom
SMITH, a true evening-party hilarity is
secured, at least so says
Rob Roy McCRACKERY, O!
TEMPORARY CHANGE of INITIALs. –
“A. B.” writes to us, saying, “It is very
hard on me. But it must be so. I enjoy
Christmas thoroughly—turkey, É. pud-
dings, and all the golopshus delicacies of
the season. When Christmas festivities are
“SHINE OUT, FAIR SUN.”
[The Times, following Mr. Punch's suggestion,
again records the sunshine.]
WHAT Mr. Punch suggested,
Oh! Times, you’ve kindly done.
We all are interested
To hear about the sun.
Who'd keep a log
Of rain and fog
If he could see the sun ?
Alas, the record-making,
Which you've again begun,
Is often record-breaking
In just recording none!
Day after day,
You mostly say,
“Bright sunshine, London, none.”
WAKE UP.-It is announced that Mr.
GooDAY will be the new General Manager
of the Brighton Railway. Travellers on
the line might say that hitherto Goodnight
would have been more appropriate for the
sleepy railway of sleepy Sussex. Unless
they remarked that the trip from Ports-
mouth to Hastings, or even from Victoria
to Brighton after 4.30 P.M., was a good
day's journey. Good, eh? öniy they are
always too miserably tired even to make
bad puns.

SPORTIVE SONGS.
A Poetical Young Person is inditing an effusion
to his fancied Mistress, when he receives a
coldly-worded missive.
ITHought that we were friends that night,
Or something else, or something else!
You filled my heart with sweet delight,
Or something else, or something else!
Your lips were telephones to me,
The while your eyes made mine to see,
I fancied all that you might be
Of something else, of something else!
I thought that we’d together roam
In somewhere else, in somewhere else!
But everywhere should be our home
In somewhere else, in somewhere else!
By sunny waters, unknown seas,
"Mid everlasting blooms and trees,
You, only you, I'd slave to please,
In somewhere else, in somewhere else!
You never should your power lose,
And somewhat else, and somewhat else!
Yours be the right to pick and choose,
And somewhat else, and somewhat else!
Yours be the voice to guide our way,
You to command and I obey,
You be the “Yea,” not I the “Nay,”
And somewhat else, and somewhat else!
In praise of you I'd use a ream,
For no one else, for no one else!
Reality’s in you a dream,
In no one else, in no one else!—
I'd written this when you upset
My auto-car, and with regret
I read between the lines, you've met
A Word FRoM THE CRACKERIEs.—A reli-
able recipe from our own Crackery book on
how to make a Christmas evening go off
as it should in the crackiest, cheeriest
method. First, deck the board in all the
tinselled graces from “The Artistic Table
Decorations,” then, under the blue light
of the “X Rays,” the marvels of “The
Cinematographe" can be mixed with sea-
sonable fare from “Relics of the North,”
trifles left by NANsen's bears. Most di-
gestible! Though possibly, after devouring
“The Christmas Stories,” “Goblins,” as
the pervading spirit of festivity, may haunt
one's dreams. No matter, with such in-
"redients, served as they are by ToM
SMITH, a true evening-party hilarity is
secured, at least so says
Rob Roy McCRACKERY, O!
TEMPortARY CHANGE of INITIALs. –
“A. B.” writes to us, saying, “It is very
hard on me. But it must be so. I enjoy
Christmas, thoroughly—turkey, pies, pud:
dings, and all the golopshus delicacies of
the season. When Christmas festivities are
“SHINE OUT, FAIR SUN.”
[The Times, following Mr. Punch's suggestion,
again records the sunshine.]
WHAT Mr. Punch suggested,
Oh! Times, you've kindly done.
We all are intereste
To hear about the sun.
Who'd keep a log
Of rain and fog
If he could see the sun ?
Alas, the record-making,
Which you've again begun,
Is often record-breaking
In just recording none!
Day after day,
You mostly say,
“Bright sunshine, London, none.”
WAKE UP.-It is announced that Mr.
GooDAY will be the new General Manager
of the Brighton Railway. Travellers on
the line might say that hitherto Goodnight
would have been more appropriate for the
sleepy railway of sleepy Sussex. Unless
they remarked that the trip from Ports-
mouth to Hastings, or even from Victoria
to Brighton after 4.30 P.M., was a good
day's journey. Good, eh? öniy they are
always too miserably tired even to make
bad puns.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
QUITE AN INSULT.
Grandmamma (to the boys, arrived for a week's visit). “So, MY DEARs,
As THAT NASTY old LEAther Football of UNCLE FRANK's is too
DANGERous For You, I have MADE this NicE New Worsted one
Fort You: to PLAY with INSTEAD.”
IN RE–PINKERTON'S INSURANCE.
PART II.-Mr. Briefless loses both a Friend and a Client.
“Now, mind, I am not to be disturbed,” I said to PortINGToN,
as, pen in hand, I sat before the desk upon which was spread the
insurance form dealing with PINKERTON's—if I may use the ex-
pression-vital characteristics. “To-day, even Sir GeoRGE must
wait, and if the matter is particularly pressing, hand it over to
Mr. DE PUTRE Potte.”
I confess I was not very sanguine of receiving anything of
moment, nor desirous of advancing the forensic career of the
learned gentleman—I cannot call him friend—I had mentioned,
but my admirable and excellent clerk understood me.
“Certainly, Sir. No doubt Mr. DE PUTRE Potte will be very
pleased to devil for you.”
“No doubt, PortingtoN, no doubt. He is welcome to the
professional distinction such an office may confer on him.”
This settled, I turned my attention to the questions that I
was asked to answer. I had PINKERTON's leave to reply without
fear or favour, and according to the dictates of my conscience.
“How long have you known him?”
Well, about ten or twelve years. That seemed the obvious
reply, but then, was not something more required? To say that
one “knows” any one suggests an intimate acquaintance with
the person that was scarcely warranted by my acquaintance with
PINRERtoN. Had I dined with him P. No, not even on Christ-
mas Day. So, after the most careful consideration, I cautiously
replied, “I have never really known him,” putting the adverb
“. When did you see him last, and was he then in good health?’”
The first part of the answer was plain sailing, and I wrote
“Yesterday.” But how about the rest? He seemed well enough,
but then I am no doctor, and cannot reply as an expert. So
again, I replied guardedly, “He told me he was in good health,”
putting the verb this time in the emphasising type.
“What is the present and general state of his health f"
Again. I was perplexed. How could I form a diagnosis as a
layman P. It was unfair to ask this of me. So I disposed of the
matter by writing, “I would prefer not to say.”
“Are you aware of his having at any time been seriously un-
well ? And if so, when f"
Another poser. According to PINKERtoN, he is never in robust
health, in fact, quite the reverse. So, remembering his injunc-
tion to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth, I replied, frankly, “From what he tells me he is always
seriously unwell.”
“Have you known or heard of his being afflicted with apoplery.
palsy, fits, or insanity, with asthma, palpitation, or other affec-
tions of the heart, lungs, or chest, with dropsy, rheumatism, gout,
erysipelas, or any other disease or permanent injury which may
tend to shorten life?”
Once more I was at a distinct disadvantage. How was I to
know whether PINKERtoN suffered from any of the above list?
So I wrote, “Again I would prefer to keep silence. You had
better ask him yourself.” And then my legal training asserted
itself. So I added a rider, “You are not bound—he will not be
making an affidavit—to believe everything he tells you.” This,
to my mind, was an eminently fair answer, and could do no
harm to any one.
“Do you know his habits to be strictly sober and temperate f"
Come, this was too strong! I was indignant at having to
reply to so insulting a question, so I answered in a tone of in-
dignation, “Gentlemen, he is my friend, and I refuse to answer.”
“Do you believe they have always been so?”
Here, again, was an unpleasant and even embarrassing inquiry.
How could I give my belief ? I could not help remembering an
occasion when he said I was not personally qualified to write the
book I propose publishing (which will, in point of fact, comprise
my memoirs), From the Gown of the Student to the Chancellor's
JWig: the Erperiences of a Practising Barrister. At the time of
the assertion I had declared that he must be either “mad or
drunk,” so I wrote, guardedly—giving him, so to speak, the bene-
fit of the doubt—“He may at times have been perfectly sober.”
“Is his occupation or mode of living in any respect injurious
to health f"
Again a poser. I recollected that he mentioned once that his
medical attendant had told him that a week at Margate would do
him a world of good. This looked as if the Wºº. considered
a change of career advisable. So I put, “Well, after all, it’s a
matter of opinion, and doctors may be wrong like other folk.”
“Were his parents long lived f"
This I could answer off-hand. He is very reticent about his
people, so I wrote the truth, “He never will tell me.”
“Hare any of his near relatives been affected with consumption,
or insanity, or any other disease supposed to be hereditary?”
Now this I could answer diplomatically, and moreover show
that whatever PINKERToN's head might be his heart was in the
right place. I wrote accordingly, “I know he has always been
most kind to his family, spending most of his time at their
sick-beds.” -
“Are there any other circumstances known to you affecting the
elegibility of this life which the Directors ought to know?”
Again distinctly inquisitorial, so I administered a well-de-
served snub, “Gentlemen,” I wrote, “I will not betray confi-
dences.”
“Do you consider the proposed assurance more than usually
hazardous?”
It was the last question, so I thought I would conclude with
a word of pleasing encouragement. “Come, gentlemen,” I
wrote, “show yourselves Englishmen and be brave!”
Glad to have finished my task I opened my door, and my ex-
cellent and admirable clerk entered.
“While you were at work, Sir, a brief was left for you.”
Could I believe my ears! Come, this was good news!
“And as you were engaged, and they_wanted to consult
counsel at once, I sent them on to Mr. DE PUTRE Potte.”
I could scarcely speak. See what I had sacrificed on the altar
of friendship !
And what makes the disappointment the harder to bear is, that
since I sent in the paper to that insurance office, PINKERTon
meets me almost daily and invariably cuts me! I am told he is
still a bachelor. (Signed) A. BRIEFLEss, JUNIor.

PARTANT POUR LA CHINE;
OR, THE New Evangelist.
My precious HENRY, hear my parting
speech,
Ere yet you sail beyond my vocal reach 1
Oft have I sauntered round by way of
Kiel
And ºped, like this, to take a transient
Ineal :
But never have I sucked the local breeze
In circumstances so unique as these.
To see you launched upon your First Cru-
sade
Sends up my blood to 60 (Centigrade).
Remember, HENRy, it's a Holy War
That you are on the point of starting for;
Or, bearing still in mind our trade's in-
crease,
Perhaps I ought to say a Holy Peace.
You will remark among my sketchy plans a
Design for re-establishing a Hansal
What is a Hansa? Any one who looks
Will find about it in the history books;
It was a Syndicate in ancient times
For planting German goods in various
climes;
It swept from end to end the briny blue
As we, my HENRY, contemplate to do,
Running the Ocean on our own account
As soon as we can raise the right amount.
Meanwhile I send you on to clear the
way;
Ach, Himmel! what a sacrifice to pay !
Think of me sometimes, HENRY, all alone
With thorns distributed about my throne!
You know your brother's wish; lay hands,
my pet,
On any mortal thing that you can get.
Employ, if feasible, your native charms,
But, failing this, resort at once to arms.
If people in the neighbourhood resist,
Let out upon them with your mailed fist;
It saves the knuckles; do be sure to take
This ºl precaution for your brother's
sake.
For longer range you carry shot and shell,
In case you see a running infidel;
I also hand you here St. Michael's Shield,
You lººk it somewhere on the coaling
e101.
Observe the blazon—our Imperial Bird,
Of which, no doubt, the dragons will have
eard ;
Call their attention to it; let them see
The Fowl is emblematical of Me.
One dragon you will notice, should he come,
Because he wears a large chrysanthemum;
HENRY, between us two, as man to man,
Be careful how you jump upon Japan'
And now before you make a final clear-
ance
(This is your positively last appearance),
Before, in fact, we tear ourselves apart,
Recite that little thing you have by heart;
And tell these gentlemen how you propose
To visit countries where the heathen grows,
And preach abroad in each distinct locality
The Gospel of my hallowed Personality.
HENRY, my boy, I cannot lightly smother
The sacred feelings of an only brother!
Pray Heaven, though we cannot go to-
gether,
You may enjoy a decent turn of weather;
And when your task, your glorious task, is
o'er
(I trust, without expenditure of gore)
Omit not to return that I may spread
The laurels on your slightly youthful head.
Charge ...; Ere he climbs the deadly
poop,
I give His Royal Highness—Whoop!

“HOCH ! TOBY, M.P., AS PRIVATE REFEREE.”
(From Ballads of Barkshire, by the late A Now.)
To Mr. Punch.
REVERED SIR,-In the large leisure of the Recess I have read
with interest. Mr. BRIEFLEss, Junior's account of his doings in
connectiºn with a form of inquiry submitted to him by an In-
surance Company, contemplating effecting a policy on the life
of one of his friends. By a coincidence, # shows how small
the world is, I have had a similar application made to me, and
beg to inclose a copy of my reply. }". perhaps, say that
the inimitable seriousness of the catechism is a literal transcript
of the official printed form.
1. How many years have you known him 2–Since the death of
Queen ANNE.
2. Are you in the habit of seeing him frequently?—Too.
3. When did you last see him?–On the stroke of midnight.
.4. In what state of health was he at that time?—Shaky on his
plns.
5. What has been the general state of his health since you
have known him P-Hopeless.
6. Do you know, or have you ever heard, that he has had asthma,
any fit, habitual cough, spitting of blood, or any disorder tend-
ing to the shortening of life?—Everything of that sort, and more.
Do you know if any of his relations i. been affected with,
or have died of, consumption ?—All gone; some galloped.
.8. Is he subject to gout, insanity, or any other constitutional

CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
(A Candid Confession.)
YEs, I received, my worthy BRowN,
Your Christmas present yesterday
Quite worth, no doubt, the good half-crown
For carriage that I had to pay.
Though you passed on a gift cigar
Undue expenditure to save you,
Yet, price for price, no doubt they are
Well worth the liquor that I gave you.
That “Rare old Scotch from Special Wat"
(Although I hoped you wouldn't guess it)
Was given me—but what of that ?—
A year ago, I must confess it.
Yet even so, friend (I'll engage
You had your hamper carriage free),
It may be fiery, but its age
Twelve months, at least, I'll guarantee.
But as for those cigars, all flam,
“Flor de” Whitechapel, I don't doubt it!
Sheer Gabbage-leaf, not worth a-rap!

For I myself am half to blame

WHILE “drinking” has been glorified by
numberless poets, eating-songs have been
sadly neglected. To help to fill an aching

great problem was to write a song which
would be truly national by appealing to all

have solved. Here it is.
NATIONAL FEEDING-SoNg.
Hail, brothers! hail the festive board I
On gastronomic wing
To culinary heights we’ve soared,
To chuckle, feed, and sing.
With soup and fish and flesh and fowl,
Cast every care behind,
Let bitter-faced ascetics howl,
We'll eat until we're blind.
Chorus.

The Vegetarian Verse.
All hail the soft, seraphic joy
Of turnip-tops and greens !
Come, join our blissful ranks, my boy,
And we will “give you beans.”
The soul that slays the tender sheep
Is savage, fierce and grim;
Enough to make a cabbage weep

Chorus.
But a cheer for the gentle and nourishing

Hurrah for banana and pippin and “pine,”
The mushroom so merry, the succulent

On which so serenely we daintily dine.
A fig for the tellow who turns from a

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN The School for Saints (Fish ER UN win), John OLIVER
Hobbes is tiresomely clever. This is a result largely due to the
circumstance that she has deliberately founded ner style upon
that of the author of Coningsby. DisBAELI's literary style was
the worst thing about his novels, a fantastic garment the wear-
ug of which was possible only to its inventor. No one but
Dizzy could have invented it, and as far as the patience of man-
kind stretches, none but he is endurable in the tricky spangled
garb. John Oliver Hobbes, dauntless beyond compare, not
only laboriously copies the manner, but brings on to her stage
the man. He is a poor, padded creature, wound up to say a
few gluttering things, and when the too obvious machinery is
exhausted, he collapses. All this is a pity, for the author of
A Sinner's Comedy, and Some Emotions and a Moral, is capable
of better things. This is proved in the opening scene of her
latest novel, by far the best passage in a fatally ambitious effort.
John OLIVER should trust to herself, let herself go along her
own path without attempt to tow frigates, old-fashioned or new.
By the way, this erudite writer puts a familiar couplet thus:–
Souvent femme varie;
Mal habil qui s'y fie.
In my Baronite's recollection the last line runs: —
Bien folqui s'y fie.
It is certainly a better rendering.
Those Dreadful Twins, on their own showing, are feeble in
comparison with their elder relatives. They evidently enjoyed
their own fun, and no one will begrudge them this pleasure.
An Almanac of Twelve Sports, by WILLIAM Nicholson (HEINE-
MANN), with words by RUDYARD KIPLING, appears in that curious
revival of old, quaintly-coloured drawing which the artist affects
uniquely, and so successfully. Immensely clever, but not to be
recommended to anybody with anything like “a head on,” in the
morning after a Christmas revel.
GILBERT ABECKETT's Comic History of England (BRADBURY,
AGNEw & Co.), is by this time a Classic of Light Literature.
Were our youthful students—not too youthful—to have this
work put into their hands for a couple of half-hours a week, the
Baron ventures to think that those possessed of any sense of
humour, after reading a chapter or so, writ and illustrated by
two Laughing Philosophers, would return, with increased zest,
to the serious study of English history. The first volume of the
Comic History carries us up to the coronation of HENRY THE
Seventh, which comes as a grand finale after the theatrical
cut-and-thrust, sensational combat between RichMonP
Ricºp methin on Bosworth Field. John Leech's illustra-
tions, bright with colour, are very gems in this work, executed
one and all of them in the genuine spirit of burlesque ! True
that “rien n'est sacré pour un sapeur,” but in this instance the
“sapeur” is the artist, who, like Billy Taylor in the ballad, is
“full of mirth and full of spree,” and whose work, meet it where
you will, is that of a genius, and is a joy for ever. ... “Custom cannot
stale his infinite variety.” May that date be far distant in the
comic history of our country when a rising generation shall be
unable to enjoy the combined work of Gilbert ABeckett...and

In glass case, hermetically sealed, sits melancholy cashier. I
look at him; he looks mournfully at me. He rises slowly; opens
portion of glass case. He seems to be crushed by some hopeless
grief. I ask him if he speaks English. I am sure I can put more
sympathy into words of my own language. He answers, in a
sad whisper, that he does. Then I beg him to change my circu-
lar note. I do it as gently as possible, but all the time I fear
he will break down. He gazes disconsolately at me while I en-
dorse it. I give it to him. Perhaps I ought to grasp his out-
stretched hand, shake it for a few moments, and murmur, “Bear
up, my dear Sir, do not give way entirely.” I hesitate, and the
... is lost." With a heart-breaking sigh, he closes the
glass shutter, and totters back to his seat. I sit down, and wait
silently in respectful sympathy. Take up newspaper, sadly.
Peruse the Deaths.
Read, slowly, the undertaker's advertisements. Look up. He
hasn't moved. Read again. Another peep. He hasn't moved
yet. What can I read now? Ah, the inquests. Read them
very deliberately, and peep once, more. e is still there,
gazing at vacancy. Perhaps I º cough gently. Try it.
His mournful eyes turn reproachfully upon me. Hide my con-
fusion behind the paper, and read about a crime. Can't wait
here all day. Peep again. I believe he is going to sleep. Feel
sleepy myself. Better get it over. Stand up. He sees me, and
is quite overcome. He beckons to another cashier, almost as
melancholy, who brings me a bordereau. I jº. this at
another glass case, and a third man, equally sad, hands me my
money. It is all over. I bow, in grave and sympathetic silence,
to the three grief-stricken gentlemen, and they bow mournfully
to me. I can hardly repress a º sob. I hasten, past, a
dismal porter, into the lobby. I gladly, see, written. up, the
word “Thiswayout,” and I run down the staircase into the
sunshine and fresh air. Feel *PH. at once. The fresh air!
No wonder they are depressed. e double windows of that
bank have probably never been opened since it was built.

they call it the Hôtel de Veal.

Motto For the UNDEFEATED DIARist.—
TO AN OLD FOGEY
Who contends that Christmas is played out.
O FRANKLY bald and obviously stout !
And so you find that Christmas, as a fête
Dispassionately viewed, is getting out
Of date.
You say it comes of moral impotence
That people loathe the #. and yet
renew it;
You can’t imagine why a man of sense
Should do it.
The studied festal air is overdone;
The humour of it grows a little thin;
You fail, in fact, to gather where the fun
Comes in.
Visions of very heavy meals arise
That tend to make your organism shiver;
Roast beef that irks, and pies that agonise
The liver;
Those pies at which you annually wince,
Hearing the tale how happy months will
follow
Proportioned to the total mass of mince
You swallow.
Visions of youth whose reverence is scant,
Who with the brutal verve of boyhood's
prime -
Insist on being taken to the pant-
-omime.
Visions of couples who arrange to kiss
(With no particular excuse to show)
In public places underneath the mis-
—tletoe.
N
Of infants, sitting up extremely late,
Who run you on toboggans down the
stair;
Or make you fetch a rug and simulate
bear.
This takes your faultless trousers at the
knees,
The other hurts them rather more behind ;
And both effect a fracture in your ease
Of mind.
All which is why you resolutely launch
Out into language of the baser sort,
Describing Christmas as an overrated
branch
Of sport.
My good dyspeptic, this will never do ;
Your weary withers must be sadly wrung!
Yet once I well believe that even you
Were young.
Time was when you devoured with other
boys
Plum-pudding sequent on a turkey-hen ;
And cracker-mottos hinting of the joys
Of men.
Time was when with the maidens you
would pull
The fiery raisin with profound delight;
When sprigs of mistletoe seemed beautiful
And right.
Old Christmas changes not
ago
He won the treasure of eternal youth :
Yours is the dotage—if you want to know
The truth.
Come, now, I'll cure your case, and ask no
Long, long

IN the “Notes and Queries” occupying the last pages of the P

ERNEST Rhys, and contains an admirable photograph of GeoRGE
DU MAURIER, likewise a sympathetic article º: “Kiki's,” or
“Kicky's,” friend, Canon AiNGER), there occurs an inquiry, put
by a “Hampstead Astronomer,” as to one of the “earliest
tenants” of “Jack Straw's Castle,” who, it was said, was an
“astronomer of some eminence.” Évidently the astronomer must
have been “of some eminence,” since he lived on the top of
Hampstead Hill. But this apart, we beg to furnish “F. F. C.”
with the following information:
John AstroNoMER, living in his observatory on the heights
of Hampstead, was not above a jest, which, being a rich man,

sayings as “Straws show which way the wind blows,” “It is the
last straw that breaks the camel's back,” “An Englishman's
house is his castle.”
The country-folk about, catching at the straws above-men-
tioned, nicknamed his house “Jack the A-straw-nomer's Castle.”
Gradually it came to be believed that JACK never existed, and
that he was only “a man of straw.” A generation later, an inn
had been built on the site, and it was to have been called “The
Castle Inn of jack the Man of straw.” But the prudent pro-
prietor, at whose expense the sign-board was to be lettered and

the action failed. Now, Sir, in consequence of the dictum of

I Do not fondly ask from you
The qualities of a noble heart,
A mind whose thoughts are pure and true,

Unselfishness, or high endeavour—
I do not ask you to “be good,

I do not ask for poet's song,
For dreamer's tale, high gifts of mind,
For orator's eloquence lighting wrong—

I do not ask for theories new,
One's powers of comprehension tasking,
For wisdom or for wit from you—

I do not ask you for the gift,
All other gifts so far above;
I will be brave, and make a shift
To live my life without your love.
Not mine to play a lover’s part,
So, though the omission is distressing,
I do not ask you for your heart—
I only ask a minor blessing.
I do not ask you when we meet
To condescend to notice me,

A PERI. AT THE GATE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Now that we are
fast approaching the end of the year, I am
already paving 1898 with good resolutions.
Perhaps for the benefit of some of your
other lady readers situated as I am, you
will like to know some of them. Well, I
have resolved:—
1. Not to snub some very nice young men
whom I have hitherto looked upon as mere
boys. They become men in time, don't
they? just as, alas! girls (thank goodness
I am one still !) become women.
2. Not to be rude to some exceedingly
polite gentlemen (rery much older than 1
am) whom I have hitherto looked upon as
fogies, and individually described, I regret
to say, as being old enough to be my father
or grandfather, as the case may be.
3. Not to be so particular as to the
amount of an admirer's income. After all,
a few hundreds a year with a flat or a
cottage often supplies more real happiness
than thousands and a baronial castle. After
ten seasons, one begins to look at these
matters from a sensible point of view.
4. Not to be too proud. In truth, a
title is but a small recommendation to the
esteem, and I may say, love, of a well-
born damsel. A respectable physician, or
an educated grocer, or a capable curate, is
infinitely preferable to a dissolute Duke, a
rampant Wiscount, or a horse-racing Ba-
Tonet. And the Free Trade in American
heiresses should not be forgotten, though
I am in favour of a strong Matrimonial
Protective Tariff for our aristocrats. You
might mention this to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer.
5 (and lastly). Not to go in so much for
fashionable gowns, hats, &c. I have ob-
served that of late years Miss Simplicity
has a great advantage over Miss Display.
I intend to be something between a #.
pital Nurse.
With all good wishes to you and my
sisters expectant, I am, dear Mr. Punch,
Yours, in hope of success,
- GERALDINE GUsherton.
The Dorecote, Prattleton-super-Mare.
THE MAID IN THE MATINEE HAT.
[At the St. James's Theatre ladies attending the
matinées are request d by th: Management to remove
their hats.-Wide Programme.]
IN a theatre a merry maid sat,
Wearing a marvellous matinée hat.
The people behind murmured and mut-
tered;
I will not repeat the language uttered,
"Twas mostly a masculine form of “drat.”
Feathers and flow’rs of a wonderful hue
To a monstrous height on that hat there
grew.
The people behind were wild with passion,
They hated the hat of latest fashion,
Complaining that it quite obscured their
View.
When in her programme this merry maid
read
A special request to ladies, which said
The people behind would most grateful
eel
If those in the front would heed their
ºl.
She quic º removed that hat from her
head.
In a theatre a manager's tact
Proved he could manage as well as could
act.
The people behind no longer vainly
Strove behind feathers to see more
plainly ;
And gratefully they acknowledged the fact.
From our own IRREPREssiblE ONE (pre-
sumably at large). Q. What is the differ-
ence between a pantomime and an oyster?
A. The opening of the one is the better
nart of the show, the opening of the other
the worse.
Following Soot.
Q. E. D.—The report of the Commis-
sioner of Metropolitan Police shows that
Londoners in 1896 were (to use the words
of a contemporary) “better citizens.”
Mr. Punch ventures to suggest that this
desirable result may also be attributed to
the members of the Force having become
better policemen. . In fact the two P's,
Police and Public, have learnt to mind one
another's Q's.

A MODEST DEMAND.
I Do not fondly ask from you
The qualities of a noble heart,
A mind whose thoughts are pure and true,
A tongue that speeds no venomed dart,
A temper sweet, or gentle mood,
Unselfishness, or high endeavour—
I do not ask you to “be good,
Sweet maid”—or even to be “
clever" |
I do not ask for poet's song,
For dreamer's tale, high gifts of mind,
For orator's eloquence lighting wrong—
Gifts all, no doubt, to you assigned;
I do not ask for theories new,
One's powers of comprehension tasking,
For wisdom or for wit from you—
(There wou'd not be much use in asking).
I do not ask you for the gift,
All other gifts so far above;
I will be brave, and make a shift
To live my life without your love.
Not mine to play a lover’s part,
So, though the omission is distressing,
I do not ask you for your heart—
I only ask a minor blessing.
I do not ask you when we meet
To condescend to notice me,
But, when kind Fate affords that treat,
Pray, bear in mind this modest plea.
I do not ask you to sit still—
Though in your chair you
wriggle—
I’d have you do whate'er you will,
only ask you—not to giggle!

A PERI AT THE GATE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Now that we are
fast approaching the end of the year, I am
already paving 1898 with good resolutions.
Perhaps for the benefit of some of your
other lady readers situated as I anº, you
will like to know some of them. Well, I
have resolved : —
1. Not to snub some very nice young men
whom I have hitherto looked upon as mere
boys. They become men in time, don't
they? just as, alas' girls (thank goodness
I am one still !) become women.
2. Not to be rude to some exceedingly
polite gentlemen (rery much older than 1
am) whom I have hitherto looked upon as
fogies, and individually described, I regret
to say, as being old enough to be my father
or grandfather, as the case may be.
3. Not to be so particular as to the
amount of an admirer's income. After all,
a few hundreds a year with a flat or a
cottage often supplies more real happiness
than thousands and a baronial castle. After
ten seasons, one begins to look at these
matters from a sensible point of view:
4. Not to be too proud. In truth, a
title is but a small recommendation to the
esteem, and I may say, love, of a well-
born damsel. A respectable physician, or
an educated grocer, or a capable curate, is
infinitely preferable to a dissolute Duke, a
rampant Viscount, or a horse-racing Ba-
Tonet. And the Free Trade in American
heiresses should not be forgotten, though
I am in favour of a strong Matrimonial
Protective Tariff for our aristocrats... You
might mention this to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer.
5 (and lastly). Not to go in so much for
fashionable gowns, hats, &c. I have ob-
served that of late years Miss Simplicity
has a great advantage over Miss Display.
I intend to be something between a Hos-
pital Nurse.
With all good wishes to you and my
sisters expectant, I am, dear Mr. Punch,
Yours, in hope of success,
- GERALDINE GUsherton.
The Dorecote, Prattleton-super-Mare.
THE MAID IN THE MATINEE HAT.
[At the St. James's Theatre ladies attending the
matinées are request d by th: Management to remove
their hats.-J’ide Programme.]
IN a theatre a merry maid sat,
Wearing a marvellous matinée hat.
The people behind murmured and mut-
tered;
I will not repeat the language uttered,
'Twas mostly a masculine form of “drat.”
Feathers and flow’rs of a wonderful hue
To a monstrous height on that hat there
grew.
The people behind were wild with passion,
They hated the hat of latest fashion,
Complaining that it quite obscured their
View.
When in her programme this merry maid
read
A special request to ladies, which said
The ºple behind would most grateful
ee
If those in the front would heed their
- º!,
She quic . removed that hat from her
head.
In a theatre a manager's tact
Proved he could manage as well as could
act.

Strove behind feathers to see more
plainly;
And gratefully they acknowledged the fact.

Following Soot.
Q. E. D.—The report of the Commis-
sioner of Metropolitan Police shows that
Londoners in 1896 were (to use the words
of a contemporary) “better citizens.”
Mr. Punch ventures to suggest that this
desirable result may also be attributed to
the members of the Force having become
better policemen. . In fact the two P's,
Police and Public, have learnt to mind one
another's Q's.

ToMMY, but like them best at school.
Don't know why MAx should call me an

A dyspeptic Bachelor, jilted by his Cousin, refuses
in somewhat bitter terms to dine with her and
her husband on New Year's Day.
I do not care for Christmas fare,
The Turkey has no charm for me;
The Goose a monster I declare,
Fat Beef a dreadful dish to see.
No stolid Pudding suits my taste,
I do not love this cannon-ball
Of suet, plums, and pseudo paste,
That's welcomed in the servants' hall!
I will not eat the false Mince-pie,
Suggesting all dyspeptic ills;
The Tipsy-cake I will not try,
'Tis redolent of after pills!
As to the oysters that are brought
The jaded appetite to whet,
Experience is dearly bought,
And typhoid I don't want to get!
The wine with which the guests are plied
Is fresh as flowers after rain;
The vinous juice is oft denied
To what you’re pleased to call Cham-
pagne!
The Port knows no ancestral bins,
But came in—yesterday, may be ;
And Sherry causes mental sins
When bottled—say, at one and three'
No! no! fair coz, I must refuse
Your offer for this New Year's Day,
Let me my humble banquet choose,
And for your happiness still pray!
The time is now for ever gone
When I was fool and you were cruel;
But credit me, although alone,
I'll drink your health in water-gruel!

learned the secret of perpetual youth, and, when as William
he quite recently astonished us all with his nimbly-danced

seventeen and twenty-five. He could touch hearts, too, and set

NEW YEAR'S EVE.
NExt year I will reform—I really will,
This time, at least, my purpose is sincere,
Unwonted virtues my new leaf shall fill
Next year.
My rule of life henceforth shall be austere,
I’ll give up betting, pay my tailor's bill,
Shun “Special Scotch” and stick to harmless beer.
But to the old year first one bumper still !—
What, midnight past? and '98 now here P
Then I must shelve my reformation till
Nert year.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
It is not from any authentic record, but WALTER CRANE has
a dainty fancy that Cinderella must have had a volume to enjoy
by the fire, so he re-issues three fairy-tales as Cinderella's
Picture Book (John LANE, The Bodley Head), one story being
that of Cinderella herself, which no doubt she will enjoy immensely,
Valentine and Orson, Puss in Boots, and Cinderella. She must
have read her own biography, only without the cleverly-inspired
illustrations that adorn these pages.
La Vie de Londres, cótés riants, par MARs (PLoN-Nourrit ET
CIE., Paris). During the last few years we have been trying by the
aid of powerful #. and still more powerful imagination, to see
what Mars was doing. And now Mars himself lets us know he was
in London, sketching us all; and only “an eye like Mars” could
see us, and he has drawn us. My Baronitess remarks that he
hasn't “mastered the English, ladies.” . How should he As a
Frenchman he is far too polite for that. But glance at his
other book, La Vie d'Ostende (Ed. Lyon-CLAEseN, Bruxelles).
There he is très bien chez luiſ Evidently life is gay and nauti-cal
by those merry sea-waves, wherein the frivolous baigneuses dis-
port themselves. They are just a tout petit peu shocking !
In The Mills of God (SMITH, ELDER), Mr. FRANCIs HARDy
grinds exceeding well. There is, my Baronite tells me, a
breezy freshness in the book, alike in respect of people and sur-
roundings. Ma Kate is a touching picture of the much-enduring
wife and the fond mother, endurance reaching the snapping
point when the church-going but in other respects not at all
estim able father, feels out for his stick as substitute for the
fatted calf wherewith to hail the prodigal's return. Then the
little mother blazes forth, and the household drudge momentarily
assumes the mastership. Sketched in by the way, but full of
life, humour, and philosophy, is the tramp, Bob Murphy, whose
brief but sufficient j is told in a vivid chapter.
Dolf WYLLARDE has done for girlhood what, some years ago,
Mrs. Hodgson BURNETT did for boyhood. A Lonely Little
Lady (HUTCHINsoN) is a miniature worthy to be framed in the
same panel as Little Lord Fauntleroy. Of the two, obviously
because Brownie is a girl, my Baronite ranks Dolf WYLLARDE's
work as the daintier. IDA LovERING's illustrations are charming.
In His Grace of Osmonde (F. WARNE & Co.), Mrs. Hodgson
BURNETT has written the sequel to A Lady of Quality, or rather
not so much a sequel, as it is a completion of the earlier work.
Now, the Baron not having had the pleasure of making the ac-
$.". of A Lady of Quality, he found the story of His
race somewhat puzzling, nor could he comprehend where the
villain was killed, why he was killed, nor whose hand struck the
blow. An intelligent friend, who had read A Lady of Quality,
kindly supplied what was lacking to his enjoyment of His Grace
of Osmonde. But why did Mrs. Hopgson BURNETT compel the
Baron to have recourse to a friend in order to understand her
story P. The first novel should have contained the whole and entire
story, as certainly a reader who is not acquainted with A Lady
of Quality will only waste his time and temper over His Grace;
while whoever knows the story of the aforesaid Lady of Quality
will also lose time, and more temper, in reading His Grace of
Osmonde. As the Lady's sister, named Anne, plays no incon-
siderable part in the drama of the two lives, the title might

NEW YEAR'S EVE.
NExt year I will reform—I really will,
This time, at least, my purpose is sincere,
Unwonted virtues my new leaf shall fill
Next year.
My rule of life henceforth shall be austere,
I'll give up betting, pay my tailor's bill,
Shun “Special Scotch” and stick to harmless beer.
But to the old year first one bumper still —
What, midnight past? and '98 now here P
Then I must shelve my reformation till
Next year.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
It is not from any authentic record, but WALTER CRANE has
a dainty fancy that Cinderella must have had a volume to enjoy
by the fire, so he re-issues three fairy-tales as Cinderella's
Picture Book (John LANE, The Bodley Head), one story being
that of Cinderella herself, which no doubt she will enjoy immensely,
Valentine and Orson, Puss in Boots, and Cinderella. She must
have read her own biography, only without the cleverly-inspired
illustrations that adorn these pages.
La Vie de Londres, cótés riants, par MARs (PLoN-Nourrit ET
CIE., Paris). During the last few years we have been trying by the
aid of powerful glasses and still more powerful imagination, to see
what Mars was doing. And now Mars himself lets us know he was
in London, sketching us all ; and only “an eye like Mars” could
see us, and he has drawn us. My Baronitess remarks that he
hasn't “mastered the English, ladies.” . How should hel As a
Frenchman he is far too polite for that. But glance at his
other book, La Vie d'Ostende (Ed. Lyon-CLAESEN, Bruxelles).
There he is très bien chez luiſ Evidently life is gay and nauti-cal
by those merry sea-waves, wherein the frivolous baigneuses dis-
port themselves. They are just a tout petit peu shocking!
In The Mills of God (SMITH, ELDER), Mr. FRANCIs HARDY
grinds exceeding well. There is, my Baronite tells me, a
breezy freshness in the book, alike in respect of people and sur-
roundings. Ma Kate is a touching picture of the much-enduring
wife and the fond mother, endurance reaching the snapping
point when the church-going but in other respects not at all
estimable father, feels out for his stick as substitute for the
fatted calf wherewith to hail the prodigal's return. Then the
little mother blazes forth, and the household drudge momentarily
assumes the mastership. Sketched in by the way, but full of
life, humour, and philosophy, is the tramp, Bob Murphy, whose
brief but sufficient . is told in a vivid chapter.
Dolf WYLLARDE has done for girlhood what, some years ago,
Mrs. Hodgson BURNETT did for boyhood. A Lonely Little
Lady (HUTCHINson) is a miniature worthy to be framed in the
same panel as Little Lord Fauntleroy. Of the two, obviously
because Brownie is a girl, my Baronite ranks Dolf WYLLARDE's
work as the daintier. IDA LovERING's illustrations are charming.
In His Grace of Osmonde (F. WARNE & Co.), Mrs. Hodgson
BURNETT has written the sequel to A Lady of Quality, or rather
not so much a sequel, as it is a completion of the earlier work.
Now, the Baron not having had the pleasure of making the ac-
$.". of A Lady of Quality, he found the story of His
race somewhat puzzling, nor could he comprehend where the
villain was killed, why he was killed, nor whose hand struck the
blow. An intelligent friend, who had read A Lady of Quality,
kindly supplied what was lacking to his enjoyment of His Grace
of Osmonde. But why did Mrs. Hodgson BURNETT compel the
Baron to have recourse to a friend in order to understand her
story? The first novel should have contained the whole and entire
story, as certainly a reader who is not acquainted with A Lady
of Quality will only waste his time and temper over His Grace;
while whoever knows the story of the aforesaid Lady of Quality
will also lose time, and more temper, in reading His Grace of
Osmonde. As the Lady's sister, named Anne, plays no incon-
siderable part in the drama of the two lives, the title might
have been Sister Anne; or, Is Anyone Coming? and though 'tis
true there is no Blue Beard, yet the question might have been fre-
quently asked, when the villain, having been knocked on the
head in the first story, which the Baron hasn't read, the two

faces of the Viennese women, and the in-
side of the cathedral, and some more pretty
faces, and a few plays at the theatres, you
have seen everything worth seeing, and
you had better begin looking at the pretty
faces again. Unless your tastes are pecu-
liar, and you admire streets like Northum-
berland Avenue, or are fond of bad pave-

If you are fond of eating, you have a
grand chance. In a Viennese hotel it goes

national hours.

begin déjeuner, and while these are finish-

Germans drop in to dine, and the English
lunches and the Austrian dinners, with the
Austrian liqueurs and cigars, keep it up till
the afternoon tea for the English, or coffee
for the Germans, who finish just as the
French begin dinner at half-past five, in
time to go to the theatre, and while they
are dining the Germans have another light
meal, and when they all start for the
theatre, the English and Americans are
beginning dinner, which is followed by the
suppers of the Austrians who have not
gone to the theatre, and after these come
the suppers of those who have, and the
final, fifth or sixth, meal of the Germans,
prolonged by beer and more cigars till one
in the morning. It is kolossall
So good-bye to Vienna, and the pretty
faces and pretty dresses, and the courteous
Austrians, and the endless tips. One last

Not to the sound of Royal lips colliding,

The latest Teuton terror, darkly gliding,
Descends on Britain's coasts'
Not as the Chow-chow squadron takes the

With cressets' flare and roll of throbbing

In silent armaments with stealthy motion
The German Beetle comes.
A cause of madness in our kitchen Maries,
Their vestal hearth he rudely violates;
He sidles in among our ancient Lares,
And settles on our grates.
The witching hour that wakes the wanton

Beholds him doing that which is not

He loves the § because his deeds are evil,

Drawn indirectly from his cosmic Chief–
His facile gift of rapid reproduction
Simply transcends belief
The Native who, secure in his position,
Waxed fat and kicked upon the scullery

Now feels the deadly strain of competition
He never felt beforel
Less gaily from behind the heated boiler
He sallies out on sinful plunder bent;
The presence of a strange imported spoiler

More warily he quits his wainscot-hollow
To drink the oven's enervating airs,
For fear the foreigner may go and swallow

Vienna.-Such a place for Museums
They are everywhere. There is even one
in the Bourse. Perhaps it contains por-
traits of company-promoters, a sort of
financial Chamber of Horrors. Goodness
knows!
ful art collections, and some of the pretty
faces of the Viennese women, and the in-
side of the cathedral, and some more pretty
faces, and a few plays at the theatres, you
have seen everything worth seeing, and
you had better begin looking at the pretty
faces again. Unless your tastes are pecu-
liar, and you admire streets like Northum-
berland Avenue, or are fond of bad pave-
ments and miserable trees, or of eating.
If you are fond of eating, you have a
grand chance. In a Viennese hotel it goes
When you have seen the wonder-
on all day, each visitor keeping to his
faces and pretty dresses, and the courteous
national hours.
The earliest birds, from Germany usu-
ally, begin breakfast about seven, other
*arly birds, English perhaps, follow them,
then Austrians have coffee, and lazier Eng-
lish and Americans go on with more sub-
a light lunch, till the French and Italians
begin déjeuner, and while these are finish-
ing, with liqueurs and cigars, the first
Germans drop in to dine, and the English
lunches and the Austrian dinners, with the
Austrian liqueurs and cigars, keep it up till
the afternoon tea for the English, or coffee
for the Germans, who finish just as the
French begin dinner at half-past five, in
time to go to the theatre, and while they
are dining the Germans have another light
meal, and when they all start for the
theatre, the English and Americans are
beginning dinner, which is followed by the
suppers of the Austrians who have not
gone to the theatre, and after these come
the suppers of those who have, and the
final, fifth or sixth, meal of the Germans,
prolonged by beer and more cigars till one
in the morning. It is kolossall
So good-bye to Vienna, and the pretty
Austrians, and the endless tips. One last
ride in a Fiaker, full speed over those
awful stones. Cling on tightly. No bones
broken. Nothing fallen out. Thank good-

THE,TEUTONIO PLAGUE.
[The German Beetle, who thrives on . fare
than his British equivalent, and reproduces himself
with astonishing rapidity, is gradually supplanting
the native in our very midst.—Daily Paper.]
Not to the sound of Royal lips colliding,
Not to the crusted smack of Kingly
toasts,
The latest Teuton terror, darkly gliding,
Descends on Britain's coasts'
Not as the Chow-chow squadron takes the
ocean,
With cressets' flare and roll of throbbing
drums;
In silent armaments with stealthy motion
The German Beetle comes.
A cause of madness in our kitchen Maries,
Their vestal hearth he rudely violates;
He sidles in among our ancient Lares,
And settles on our grates.
The witching hour that wakes the wanton
weevil
Beholds him doing that which is not
º: ;
He loves the dark because his deeds are evil,
| He loathes the blessed light.
Untempted by the
foison, ---
| For which your pampered British Beetles
larder's toothsome
go -
| He battens with success upon the poison
Designed to lay him low.
A shrewd ascetic, he derives an ample
| Inflation from the coarsest kind of food;
He is a precious type, a proud example
Of Teuton hardihood.
Colonial—less by taste than by instruction
Drawn indirectly from his cosmic Chief—
His facile gift of rapid reproduction
Simply transcends belief
The Native who, secure in his position,
Waxed * and kicked upon the scullery
oor
Now feels the deadly strain of competition
He never felt beforel
Less gaily from behind the heated boiler
He sallies out on sinful plunder bent;
The presence of a strange imported spoiler
Mars all his sweet content.
More warily he quits his wainscot-hollow
To drink the oven's enervating airs,
For fear the foreigner may go and swallow
His wife at unawares.
The solemn facts are proved beyond rebut-
- -
ting
Vainly we clutch at any straw of doubt;
The German article is slowly cutting
Our local talent out!
England! my country! is there no renewing
Our lost pre-eminence of other years?
What is the bellicose bug-shooter doing?
Where are the Volunteers?
At the Home of Plenty.
Mr. Stopcock (joyously, to Mr. PLUMBER).
Take my word for it, this is going to be a
green winter. No busted pipes, no water
turned off, no nothing.
Mr. Plumber (gloomily). Ah! wot's one
man's meat is truly another's pison. -
suppose wery soon we shall be treated to a
Hindian Summer from November to











stantial breakfasts, while the Germans have
March. [Sighs deeply.

Who loved him well.
Gone now his laughter's lusty note

By sombre paths at best we tread;
And duller seems the world to-day

GoNE the gay wit that sparkled free
With airy grace and breezy ton,
And took us over mount and sea
With Tartarin of Tarascon;

And caused the life beside the Rhone
To live again in many a land'

A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION.
(By one who has given them up.)
I’ve hitherto upheld on New Year's Eve
One of our cherished annual institutions,
That is, as each December's dying, to
retrieve
One's character with virtuous resolutions.
Ten years and more ago there were a lot
Of new and personal reforms I’d plan
out.—
Some possible, some—well, distinctly not
(That was before one's youthful ardour
ran out).
Let's see—I meant each January the first
To get up early and to knock off smoking,
“Porker Welba.”
With temp'rance drinks to moderate my
thirst—
The prospect was by no means mirth-
provoking!
Enthusiasms cool; within three days
I had become a desperate back-slider,
Without the perseverance that essays
To imitate the ant or plodding spider.
So now I've only one resolve to make,
And that I'll keep without remorse or
sorrow ;
That is, I’ll have no idle vows to break,
By framing 



On you, with feelings of a friend,
We lay this º wreath!

IN MEMORIAMI.
SIR FRANK LOCKWOOD, Q.C., M.P.
BJRN 1846. DIED Dec. 19, 1897.
FRANK Lockwood dead! Then we have lost
A life we counted more than dear;
What darker shadow could have crossed
Our Christmas cheer?
Quick eye to read the heart of fun!
Light hand to catch its passing spell!
Punch, too, has claimed the work of one
Who loved him well.
Gone now his laughter's lusty note
That malice never once could mar;
The genial wit that gently smote
And left no scar.
Small mirth enough beguiles our way;
By sombre paths at best we tread;
And duller seems the world to-day
With Lockwood dead!
RATIONAL STAINED-GLASS,

[Professor Sir W. B. RichMono, R.A., in a re-
cent lecture, protested against “the mawkish,
effeminate, weak faces so often pictured in stained-
glass windows,” and suggested that they should
deal with prominent personages and subjects of the
day. , Mr. Punch has therefore much pleasure in
submitting a few designs, of which this is the first,
to be used, without charge, in the decoration of both
Houses of Parliament, the Law Courts, Guildhall,
