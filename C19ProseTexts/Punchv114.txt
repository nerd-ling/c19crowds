PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

D
(From. Mr. Punch, War Path, Cradle of Deep, to Himself, 85, Fleet Street.)
EAR ME,
I AM lying off . I should prefer to speak the truth, but the Censorship is very stiff. At dawn this
morning, after a short conversation on the semaphore, Your Special Commissioner emerged like a dove from the good
Ark Charivari, and was rowed across by TOBY to the American flagship, Sampson Ayonistes.
"Come aboard, Madam!" I observed, as I cleared the bulwarks and dipped my head-piece to a maiden lady, who
wore the semblance of a marine deity, and paced the deck, glass under arm, cutlass at belt.
"Step right here, Sir," said COLUMBIA (for it was she).
I secured TOBY to the binnacle-lid, hitched up my trousers, executed the first section of a hornpipe, and spoke.
"And when is this war going to happen, anyhow?" I asked.
"Sir," she replied, "we allow that eventualities have not proceeded with the all-fired rapidity on which we
reckoned. We find that this is not the soft job we took it for. You have to catch things before you cook them—
even Spanish onions."
"Madam," I replied, sententiously, "war is waged to-day with regular armies and transport systems and com-
missariat departments, and other weapons of precision and mobility. It cannot be conducted on the fine impromptu
methods of the good old guerillas. You have done one or two big exploits; at Manila, for instance. How goes the
Laureate's rhyme:—
"The Dewey splendour falls
On Morro Castle walls?
And the Merrismack—that was a noble bit of scuttling. But single deeds of unrehearsed bravery do not win a war
nowadays. The Kriegspiel is a game that takes some knowing; and, unless your opponent is a stuffed dummy, you
don't have matters all your own way at the first sitting."
"Well," she answered, "I guess we have tasted blood now anyway. And we 've got the men—the right stuff,
like yours, when they 're licked into shape—and the money, and the ships—or we shall have in a few years. Yes, Sir,
we have the makings of a European Power. That's so."
"Whether," I said, "you change your old policy or not, one thing is certain. And so is another. First, that
this little turn of fighting, shoulder to shoulder, will go far to mend all bad feeling, if any is left, between North and

South. You are one nation now, by the ties of comradeship. And, second, you have learned where to look for friends
when you want 'em. Now, Madam, my name is Mr. PUNCH; and it was never my way to talk high-falutin' sentiment.
Your people and mine come of the same stock, the kind that don't wear its heart on its sleeve, or jump down other
people's throats. But when the pinch comes we are there or thereabouts. Now, some of us have old European in-
stincts, and we didn't much fancy the swash-buckler way in which you started this war, however right its object; and
then again, we were still a bit sore about your diplomatic bluff over Venezuela. But you take it from me, Ma'am, that
we have made up our minds to forget these details, because in the long run you and we are bound to be friends. And if
this war does no other good, it will be worth every dollar you drop over it if it proves to the world that in the future
we arc to stand or fall together."
"Sir," replied COLUMBIA, graciously, "I accept and reciprocate your warm expressions of amity. And I am free
to admit that our attitude in the Venezuela affair was calculated to annoy you. Also, a few plain words from our candid
friend, Captain MAHAN, together with our recent experience in dealing with a fifth-rate adversary, have opened our eyes
to the inevitable result of the first fortnight's engagement with your excellent fleet, if wo had come to blows. Ten
years' time may find us a sea-power; but, in any case, we shall never meet you on the ocean except in common cause
against a common enemy. Embrace me, Mr. PUNCH."
I embraced.
"And now, Madam," I added, after recovering, "don't you think this dull business of the war might well be
wound up? You have endured enough from your own Yellow Press; you don't want the enemy's Yellow Fever to.).
Their Admiral has already given you a sample of old-world courtesy. Could you not retaliate by making the way easy
for the satisfaction of his honour?"
"Any form of mediation emanating from you," she said, "must receive my best consideration."
"Then," I replied, "I bear with me here in duplicate the surest emblems of peace. I place them in your hands,
Madam. Honour me by keeping one; and let a pinnace, flying our flag with yours, convey the other to the gallant
Admiral; the gift itself will do the rest. For need I say that it is my

OF CORSETS—A FACT!
[A paper read before the British Ai»oc;ation at
Bath in praise of coreet* declared that " reasonably
tight" lacing menaced mental and physical activitj,
by causing a more liberal supply 01 blood to tbt1
brain, mugclei and nerves.]
LONG vainly have reformers tried
To stem the force of ladies' wills,
And long indignantly decried
Tight-lacing as the worst of ills.
Yet nothing stayed the use of stays;
Till now at length in their excuse
Benignant science smiles, and says
That folly lies in their abuse.
.MMORTAL WILLIAM, meaning SHAK-
SPEAKE, hath ever some line appropriate to
any modern instance. On Thursday last,
at the Mansion House, a policeman de-
scribed a harmless, but temporarily eccen-
tric prisoner, as "a donkey-man on board
the ship lying in Tilbury docks." So he
was "writ down an ass." He had been
guilty only of a " freak," just to show how
easily a "donkey-man" could make an ass
of himself.
THE BULL AND THE BEAR.
(A Stock Exchange Tale of Two Brothers.)
ONCE upon a time (according to the City
Press), there were two sons of the same

parents who entered into partnership as
stock-brokers. As partners they trans-
acted business on the same lines. But
when the compact was over, they specu-
lated privately on their own account. And
one went for the rise and the other for the
fall, and both employed the same broker.
They were obstinate, and held on until one
of them extracted a very considerable sum
from his near relative. Thus the story
ends so far as our contemporary is con-
cerned. It would have been interesting to
know whether the unsuccessful speculator
subsequently sought the assistance of his
uncle, or merely relied upon the appeal,
"Am I not a man and a brother?"
MELODIES AND AIRS.—Now that thoWin-
terhas begun, judicious concert-goers have
got out their fur caps, fur coats, fur rugs,
woollen comforters, foot-warmers, and
other necessaries. Provided with these, it
is often possible to spend an hour com-
fortably in an ordinary concert hall. It is
rumoured that an enterprising inventor is
about to produce a Patent Draught-proof
Shelter, something like a gigantic glass
extinguisher, each shelter to cover one
person in the audience. The air for the
lungs, and the air for the ears, would be
admitted through a small tube warmed by
hot water.

simplest form the history and results of earlier developments of
"forward policy " in India, beginning with the invasion of Afghan-
istan that ended in the memorable retreat through the Khyber
Pass in 1842. All these adventures have proved disastrous, the
darkness of defeat being illumined only by the brilliancy of the
courage of the beleaguered British troops. Each one has been

never to be guilty of omission. As each period of twenty-four

LO\VER;BOYS' CONFERENCE.
THE first of these assemblies, which are to form a recurring
feature of the Christmas Holidays, met yesterday; Mr. J-N-B
Septimus, of Giggleswick, occupied the chair. Numerous letters
were read expressing regret for non-attendance ; the chief reasons
assigned being the exigencies of the pantomime season, and the
claims of dyspepsia consequent upon Christmas conviviality.
The Chairman in brief but effective terms explained the objects
of the meeting. It had been summoned for the purpose of
considering the resolutions discussed at the late Head Masters'
Conference, or, more correctly, at the late Conference of Head
Masters; and for other purposes. Those who had followed the
history of the Engineers' Dispute—he could not accurately say
that he himself had taken an absorbing interest in it—must have
observed that the Employers had rotted the Trades' Union by
forming an amalgamation "on their own." By the Rule of
Three (groans) it could be shown that as the Employer was to
the Workman so the Boy was to the so-called Master. He (the
Boy) employed him (the Master) : and actually went so far as to
pay him—though perhaps indirectly—a very handsome wage for
work done, or even left undone. It was unnecessary to ask such
an intelligent assembly as he saw before him, not to be deceived
by that abuse of language by which, in academical terminology,
the employe? proper took upon himself the misleading title of
"Master." To avoid confusion, however, it would be convenient
if gentlemen, when referring to that class of individual, would
employ the recognised expression, "Drunker." ("Hear, hear!")
He woujd remind his fellow-employers that the only sure way
of improving their position was to combine, on the four three-
quarter-back system, against the banded tyranny of those who
were, strictly speaking, their slaves. At the same time it was
not his, the Chairman s, wish, by insisting too irreconcilably on
their natural rights, to drive education over to Germany, and
the motto that animated their reforms; and he therefore begged
to invite any suggestions that might make for compromise. The
athletic gentleman here resumed the chair amid hearty cat-calls.
The first resolution was moved by Mr. BR-WN Quintus of
Cheltenham in the following form: "That in the opinion of this
Conference there is a growing tendency, much to be deplored,
in the direction of devoting too much time to study, to the
neglect of the more urgent claims of athletics." He felt sure
that he voiced the opinion of all present when he said (" Hear,
hear!") that study was an exsellent thing ("No, no!"). Ir
fellows would allow him to complete his sentence by the addi-
tion, well-known in analysis, of a definitive adverbial clause
("Shop!"), he was about to say that study was an excellent
thing in the opinion of their venerated parents. (" Shame!")
But there were limits; and what was good, in the opinion of the
aforesaid, who were probably never young themselves, might be
carried, and was carried, to unnatural excess. Study, he con-
sidered, was intended as a healthy sedative to be administered
in the intervals of serious athletic pursuits. One could not play
all day; one must eat, for instance (loud cheers); and in addition
to the intervals for refreshment both at, and between, meals,
there were moments when tired Nature demanded a contrast
which should give an added zest to their habitual occupation.
At such moments he thought that a French verb or two (not of
course the irregular ones), or a touch of Euclid (though he dis-
approved on principle of the fifth proposition of the first book)
might be found rather entertaining than otherwise. (" Ques-
tion!") But to suppose, as was the tendency with modern
Brushers, that work was the sole object of their existence, in
fact, if he might so say, their single raisnn data, was to fly in
the face of all the best traditions; in other words, it was skittles.
At this point the speaker sat down hard upon his silk-hat, to the
marked approval of his immediate neighbours.

had worked out before coming down to the House: but anyhow,

the chair, and carried with appalling unanimity.
Encouraged by the pressure of a pointed instrument, Mr.
R-B-NS-N Minor, of Haileybury, rose to move the next resolution,
which was couched in terms of great conciseness: "That Latin
Verse is rot." It was not always, he said, that he found himself
in agreement with his own, or any other, Head Brusher. (Loud
applause.) But he was honestly glad to admit that old L-TTL-T-N
had had the pluck to ventilate this offensive nuisance. Poets
were born and not made. If they would pardon the expression
he would like to say, Poeta nascit, non fitur. (A voice—" Good
old Hobbles!") Now he did not happen to be born that way,
and he was glad to think that he was not likely to be made either.
Speaking for himself as one who hoped eventually, with luck, to
be a brewer, he did not see the direct utility of verse-composition
in a deceased language. BALBUS and C.KSAII and those Johnnies
were bad enough, but when it came to making elegies like OVID
with a Gradus it was simply footling. (Applause.) If you
must have poetry, what you got at the Music Halls was good
enough for him.

Mr. S.Mi-K-.N.s Minimus (provenance unknown), in supporting
the resolution "That Latin Verse is rot," said that the mention
of Music Halls reminded him of something that was on his chest.
He had often felt that it would be a salutary change, if instead
of dull people coming down from time to time to lecture to
them on Alrica and Mars and those things, an invitation was
given to Mr. DAN LENO and similar artists to give them now and
then an entertainment combining elevation with amusement.

The Chairman here said that a pressing engagement to tea,
followed by a Barnum-and-Bailey, compelled him to adjourn the

proposals: —
That means should be adopted for keeping a closer supervision
over the Junior Bruahers in their hours of leisure.
That in all circumstances in which hitherto the relation of Boy
and Brusher had been an individual relation, as in the employ-
ment of the rod, cane, or birch, the right of combination among
Boys for the protection of their interests be recognised.
That facilities for over-time in bed be extended.
A cordial interchange of orange-peel then terminated the

LOWER^BOYS' CONFERENCE.
THE first of these assemblies, which are to form a recurring
feature of the Christmas Holidays, met yesterday; Mr. J-N-S
Septimus, of Giggleswick, occupied the chair. Numerous letters
were read expressing regret for non-attendance ; the chief reasons
assigned being the exigencies of the pantomime season, and the
claims of dyspepsia consequent upon Christmas conviviality.
The Chairman in brief but effective terms explained the objects
of the meeting. It had been summoned for the purpose of
considering the resolutions discussed at the late Head Masters'
Conference, or, more correctly, at the late Conference of Head
Masters; and for other purposes. Those who had followed the
history of the Engineers Dispute—he could not accurately say
that he himself had taken an absorbing interest in it—must have
observed that the Employers had rotted the Trades' Union by
forming an amalgamation "on their own." By the Rule of
Three (groans) it could be shown that as the Employer was to
the Workman so the Boy was to the so-called Master. He (the
Boy) employed him (the Master) : and actually went so far as to
pay him—though perhaps indirectly—a very handsome wage for
work done, or even left undone. It was unnecessary to ask such
an intelligent assembly as he saw before him, not to be deceived
by that abuse of language by which, in academical terminology,
the employee proper took upon himself the misleading title of
"Master." To avoid confusion, however, it would be convenient
if gentlemen, when referring to that class of individual, would
employ the recognised expression, "Brusher." ("Hear, hear!")
He would remind his fellow-employers that the only sure way
of improving their position was to combine, on the four three-
quarter-back system, against the banded tyranny of those who
were, strictly speaking, their slaves. At the same time it was
not his, the Chairman's, wish, by insisting too irreconcilably on
their natural rights, to drive education over to Germany, and
i the motto that animated their reforms; and he therefore begged
I to invite any suggestions that might make for compromise. The
athletic gentleman here resumed the chair amid hearty cat-calls.
The first resolution was moved by Mr. BR-WN (Juintus of

MY DEAR NEPHEW;—You say that you
have determined to give up the attempt ot

are not up to the examination," and sec-
ondly, "because you don't know what on
earth you would do if there were war."
Then you add, you don't care for the Law,
are not fit for the Church hate medicine,
and are "too great a duffer for play-
acting." So, having come to these conclu-
sions, you ask me ifthere is an opening in
You appear to have arrived at the conclu-
sion that, as you seem to be good for
nothing else, perhaps you may be intended
for the newspapers. You declare you can-
not write, know nothing about grammar,
and believe your spelling to be something
awful—a word you prefer to spell "orfle.
And having told me all this, you ask my
opinion as to your capability for becoming
a journalist.
Well, my dear nephew, to be frank with
you, I cannot conscientiously say that
your accomplishments are quite up to the
standard of the calling. I would speak of
the labour as "profession" if I were not
be a scholar, and, as the exercise of dis-
crimination has to come into play, a gentle-
man. He will be none tha worse for having
bad a Public tnuool and University Educa-
tion; and perhaps a trifle the better for
being in a position to feel that his ances-
tors have been scholars and gentlemen
before him. So you see that after all it is
not everyone who can boast of being a
journalist in the best sense of a sometimes
misused word. But when 1 have said this,
I think I can find an opening for you. But
mind you, I question whether my proposal
is exactly journalism.
Now wnat I would suggest is simply
this. If you cannot write yourself, get
some one to write for you. You can be-
come an interviewer. Your opening matter
can be in common form. Short account of
the exterior of the house, the hall and the
study. Then let your subject supply the
rest of the article. Take down wnat he
says, and send him the proof to correct.
But if you find this too much trouble, you
can lithograph a letter asking some emi-
nent individual what he thinks of this,
that and t'other. If you have a copy of
that excellent publication, Wlu> 's II /i«,
beside you—as you should—all you will
have to do is to select from its biogra-
phical pages a suitable number of appro-
priate personages, and bombard them with
your circulars. By this means, you will be
able to let an expectant public know what
the Premier thinks about golf, where the
Lord Chancellor goes for his midsummer
holidays, and whether the Archbishop of
Canterbury considers mince-pies less in-
digestible than plum-pudding.
it you adopt my suggestion, no doubt
you will be able to obtain a livelihood, but
you must clearly understand that 1 cannot
guarantee you the right to call yourself a
journalist. With the best wishes of the

Thursday night.—Have got over inter-
view and explanation with Mrs. B. about
the third boy. It is a nuisance, but I sup-
pose we can't help ourselves now. Suggest
they should retire to their rooms and wash
hands, and get tidy for dinner. "Oh! that
don't matter," says TOMMY, cheerily,
"blow washing—it's such rot!" Am
mildly insistent, however, on this point,
and away they go upstairs, whooping and
yelling like so many Sioux Indians. Ten
minutes later, they descend, like an ava-
lanche, into hall, sliding down bannisters,
one after the other, and landing with
a crash into hat-stand, knocking ii over,
and bringing down whip-rack with it.
We go in to dinner, BOOTS sweeping down
Chinese idol—a pet possession or mine-^as
he enters room. Except for MAX trying
to give Pincher spoonful of soup, which
missed the dog but went over Turkey
carpet, things are fairly quiet till dessert,
when TOMMY essays an olive and hurriedly
retires from room to get rid of it. BOOTS
eats enormous quantities of preserved
fruit, and Shortly after relapses into moody
silence, looking rather pallid. Dinner over,
MAX says he "would like to do a smoke,"
but this I sternly forbid. He then strolls
round room, picking up all the quaint
china pieces, and keeping me in perfect
fever of anxiety; whilst TOMMY teases my
pet Persian cat until, with a wild "Mol-
row!" she bolts for door, upsetting fern-
saucer in her rapid flight. TOMMY looks
quite surprised, and remarks that he is
"blowed>f if he didn't think she liked it.
At 9.30, venture to hint that it is time all
good little boys were in bed. BOOTS at
once rises, and (paler than ever) slinks
quietly away. TOMMY and MAX both pro-
test that when at home they always sit up
till ten. Sigh resignedly, and wait another
half-hour. At ten, say, "If you '11 go to
bed quietly now, we 'II ferret the banks to-
morrow, and you shall have some rabbit-
ing. "Hooray I" Ear-splitting sound,
which brings Mrs. B. in from housekeeper's
room. I apologise for them; say "Boys
will be boys." "Boys will be men," she
retorts, "and they ought to behave them-
selves according." TOMMY, I regret to say,
puts his thumb to his nose as she closes the
door behind her. Get them off to bed at
last. Thank goodness! Now for quiet
cigar and just "Please, Sir, the young
gentleman who went up to bed first is
groaning terrible, and says he 's going to

never treated him well), if you 'd be kind
enough to go upstairs and see him." Put
down cigar and visit sufferer. Find him
sea-green colour, and wonder what on
earth I 'm to do. Tells me, between heart-
rending groans, that he is suffering severely
in the lower chest. Luckily, our doctor
lives only half a mile away, so send my

operation, which was "completely success-
ful, my dear Sir; patient died, it's true,

of responsibility.
PROVINCIAL PATRIOTISM AND AET.—
Brighton and Southend, to commemorate
the Jubilee, have erected statues of the
^irEEN. In honour of this exclusively
British celebration, these enlightened
towns, having heard the name of Mr.
MICHAEL ANGELO, obtained their statues
from Italy. They would not employ mere
Englishmen. Captious critics complain
that the statues do not appear to have
been executed by MICHAEL ANGELO. But
Brighton and Southend are quite satisfied.
They know that the jobs were executed by
the present firm, which carries on the large
business of Messrs. ANGELO, DONATBLLO,
GHIBERTI & Co., most of the members of
the old firm being dead.

ADVICE GRATIS.
MY DEAR ETHEL,— You complain, I
understand, that in my last letter I failed
to obey your wishes by sending you notes
on "what is worn" in town just now. A
modest distrust of my own powers must
be my excuse. Frankly, it is extremely
difficult for a man (and a bachelor at that)
to enter lightly into the mysteries of cos-
tume; it seems to him that a lifetime ot
study could scarce fit him to deal with a
subject so difficult in itself, so abstruse in
its technical terms. However, you repeat
your request with such insistence that I
dare not shirk the task again. Perhaps
from the bald prose of my description you
will be able to evolve the poetry of a
fashionable costume, wherewith, I take
it, you intend to dazzle your villagers at
Puddleton at the commencement of the
New Year. In any case, you will do me the
justice to recollect that nothing short of
your imperious bidding could have induced
me to undertake the task, and that none
can be more deeply conscious of my defi-
ciencies as a fasnion-writer than myself.
How gladly would I have made this letter
a joy to you and your numerous girl-
friends, how gladly would I have garnished
it with such words, full of occult delight,
as "guipure," and "passementerie," and
"poult de xoie," did not my unhappy ig-
norance prevent me from knowing what
they mean!
However, I must delay no longer; with-
out further excuse, and merely begging you
to pardon :>ny blunders more than usually
gross, I will write out my notes, collected
during a few walks in the fashionable part
of London.
Let us begin nt the toj1. with the all-
important hat. If you wish for one quite
in the latest mode, this appears to be the
recipe. Buy a hat several sizes too large
for you. Adorn it with ribbons of the most
flaring hue, scarlet and magenta, for
choice. Put it on in the ordinary way.
Then ask a friend to strike a severe blow
on one side of the brim. The result, natu-
rally, will be that the hat will assume e
position en the side of your head; the
greater the angle the better. Your "head-
gear," as I notice some of the milliners are
beginning to call it, will then be fashion-
able beyond reproach.
The top part of the dress (which is called
the "body," isn't it P) now mostly worn is
indeed remarkable. Also, it must be con-
venient, because it doesn't matter how you
put it on, as the back is exactly the same
as the front, and there is a kind of ruff
below the waist, which sticks out stiffly all
the way round. Both in front and behind
the thing should be made with four times
as much material as is sufficient; under-
neath you should be able to conceal, let n-
say, a fair-sized sewing-machine without
detection. The result, I have just remem-
bered, is called a "Russian blouse," and
for pure, undiluted hideousness it defies all
rivals.
I can't say much about the skirt, except
that, of course, you "11 be careful to choosf
a colour for it that clashes as violently at-
possible with the rest of the costume. It
should be lined with, bright red; and in this
muddy weather you can legitimately pre-
vent the public from being ignorant that
the red lining is there. But it were idle to
offer you or any woman instruction on that
point.
It will add greatly to the effect if you tie

fully bejewelled with imitation gems. No-
thing, in fact, could be in better taste.
But as an alternative, you may wear a
collar-chain of gold, which will hang down
gracefully, and terminate, somewhere near
your feet, in a golden heart about the size
of a sardine-tin.
I trust that these few hints will suffice
for the present. Of course, as you say, it
is most important to you to know of all the
latest fashions at Puddleton, where, so you
put it, you are buried alive. It is good of
you to hope that I shall be able to come to
you, as your mother kindly suggests, early
in the New Year. About that,! confess, I
have some doubt. For, when I hear that
you have arrayed yourself in a costume of
the most fashionable kind, when you have
adopted the tilted hat, and the Russian
blouse, and the sham jewellery and the
rest of it—then, my dear ETHEL, I shall
hastily conclude that I have an engage-
ment which will prevent me from coming
to Puddleton. Yours most sincerely,
TO AN EXALTED PERSONAGE.
YOUR notion is all very fine,
O WILLIAM, who's second to none 1

V KS! Somewhere in the long time past,
Amid the mists of bygone years,
I thought I 'd found a love to last,
The while were smiles and never tears,
The while the roses decked all June,
The while the Sun-god shed his beams,
And Pan piped out his merriest tune—
Dreams, only dreams!
And somehow in that long ago,
When friends were many, foes were

I even thought a Winter snow
Would never cloak the hope that grew,
That neither ice, nor storm, nor rain,
Nor all the pain that joy redeems,
Could alter love or make refrain—
Dreams, only dreams!
To-day I know that I was wrong,
That Winter has its pride of place,
The battle must go to the strong,
The fleetest triumph in the race!
The brook that once I deemed a rill
Is now the mightiest of streams;
On it I meant to urge my will—
The candle-light I held still flares
With fickle and uncertain glow,
The wheat is stifled by the tares,
The clock's wound up. but will not go!

At covered foolscap stacked in reams;
Yet once their union was dear—

THE POET PAST AND PRESENT.
THE Poet is popularly supposed to have
a soul which spars above mundane things;
we can see him as he appeared in 1838,
with his "eye in a fine frenzy rolling,"
while he indited verses such as the follow-
ing, which duly appeared in that part of
the local newspaper known as Poet's
Corner": —
1838.
Once Cupid, 'tis said,
In Ri'im-h of a tad,
Distractedly sought far and wide,
"Each rose bears a thorn,
My wings will be torn
Before I find shelter," he cried.
About to despair,
He find« a couch whf re
HP slum IHTH in blissful repose.
For surelv he lies
In CELIA'S PTBH,
Which violet blossoms disclose.
But this is a practical age. The Poet has
not ceased to twang his lyre; on the con-
trary, he sings louder than ever, and to
some purpose, as the following elegant
extract from the advertisement columns
of the flurrey Comet will testify.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BABES.
THE Great Drury Lane Annual is in many respects greater than
ever. Of not a few pantomimes it may be said, "Magnificent,
but not comic"; but Tlie Babes in the Wood at Old Drury,
where, only a short while since, Druriolanus Maximus was auto-
cratic, besides being brilliant as a spectacle, is artistically excel-
lent in its scenic effects and in its rare combinations of colour;
while for rollicking nonsensical fun there are at least four
capital scenes, of which the last, "The Corner of the Paddock
and the Racecourse," is in itself a cleverly-contrived burlesque
of a great "sporting melodrama," which was, some few years
ago, the great attraction of an Autumn season at Drury Lane.
The Treasury of Ancient Drury, as well as the parents of The
Babes, Messrs. ARTHUR COLLINS and ARTHUR STURGESB, should
profit considerably by this Pantomime, for excellently well have
the two ARTHURS achieved their "joint Arthur-ship." To the

Madame GRIOOLATI (as merry as a Grig-olati), and her flying
fairies, beats the record even of Drury Lane's great shows.
DAN LENO, as the boy, never appears, speaks, dances, or sings
without evoking bursts of uncontrollable laughter; and his com-
panion, HERBERT CAMPBELL, as the Babe-sister, is "immense."
The two robbers, Messrs. GRIFFIN and DUBOIS, are equally
amusing as actors and acrobats. ERNEST D'AuBAN ably sus-
tains the ancient name and family reputation for ballet and
pantomime, while in Mr. JOHN A. WARDEN, as the Baron Ban-
bury, Mr. EDWARD TERRY might any day find an alter ego to
play for him. After the uproarious fun, the most popular inci-
dent is a noiseless and exceptionally-graceful dance by the Prince
and his future bride, for which Miss ROBINSON and Miss ADA
BLANCHE could obtain a triple encore any night they may have
I time to take it. From beginning to end, for grand spectacle,
j artistic effects, and capital fun, the Babes at Drury Lane take
the Twelfth Night cake, and behave themselves so admirably
that it is impossible to beat them.
Enter Dan Leno and Herbert Campbell. "The Babes."
indefatigable J. M. GLOVER, their most energetically-active Right
Hand (and Glover) Man (more power to his elbow and
baton!), is due all praise for the music which, having cleverly
"composed" it, sagaciously "selected" it, and admirably "ar-
ranged" it, he convincingly conducts with arms, legs, head, and
eyeglass; now upstanding, while, as a musical /Eolus, he directs
"the wind" on the stage, ever and anon keeping watchful eyes
and ears for the strings, cymbals, and big drum in the orchestra.
The Babes themselves, Messrs. DAN LENO and HERBERT CAMP-
BELL, with the Prince Paragon of Pantomime, Miss ADA
BLANCHE, all harmoniously working together, have done their
very best, and will continue to do it nightly, in order to keep
up the well-earned reputation of Old Drury, as the ancient home
of genuine English Pantomime.
The scenic artists have done wonders. Anything more per-
fectly designed and painted than Mr. HENRY EMDEN'S "Prince's
Gardens" has rarely been equalled, still more rarely (if ever)
excelled. It is a splendid specimen of how great an illusion can
be effected on a simple "cloth." Examine it carefully through
a good opera-glass. Then there is the Panorama by KAUTSKY, a
beautiful work of scenic art; the Mushroom Meadow, a quaintly-
clever arrangement by BRUCE SMITH; and once again Mr. HENRY
EMDEN compels universal applause for his last scene of all,
wherein takes place the coronation of the Prince, ADA BLANCHE,
who is united to his blushing Marian, Miss VIOLET ROBINSON,
who, as the bride, appears in "gorgeous" array. This last scene
for combination of colour, for original stage contrivances, for
grouping on what may be termed "the gangway," and for the
space above occupied by the graceful Queen Humming Bird,
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THERE are few men more capable than Dr. GEORGE SMITH of
doing justice to the task he has set himself in sketching the lives
and accomplishments of Twelve Indian Statesmen (JOHN MURRAY).
The muster roll is a blazon of honour: CHARLES GRANT, Sir
HENRY LAWRENCE, Lord LAWRENCE, Sir JAMES OUTRAM, Sir
DONALD M'LBOD, Sir HENRY DURAND, COLIN MACKENZIE, Sir
HERBERT EDWARDES, JOHN CLARK MARSHMAN, Sir HENRY MAINE,
Sir HENRY RAMSAY, and Sir CHARLES AITCHISON. Of the dozen,
Dr. SMITH, himself a distinguished Anglo-Indian, knew all gave
one, counting some as intimate friends. With the double advan-
tage of personal acquaintance, and of familiarity with social life
and political events in India, Dr. SMITH is able to re-illumine the
brilliant pathway of these noble lives. The twelve chapters
compose a fascinating study of what may be done by the English,
man abroad. My Baronite uses that term for the sake of con-
venience. As Dr. SMITH sets forth in a striking passage. Great
Britain and Ireland have been thoroughly united in building up
the Empire of India. CLIVE and WARREN HASTINGS were Eng-
lish; Lord MINTO, the Marquis of HASTINGS, and Lord DALHOUSIE
were Scotch; Ireland helped to make the QUEEN Empress of
India by giving birth to the Marquis of WELLESLEY, and to the
heroic trio of LAWRENCES—GEORGE, HENRY, and JOHN.
I am the fortunate possessor of a copy of The Story of blarl-
bnroiigh, illustrated by CARAN D'ACHE (H. GREVEL & Co.), with
descriptive text by the Hon. FRANCES WOLSELEY. This work
is, I hope, unique, as being so, it will be, in years to come,
invaluable. The particular copy that now lies open before me
is a Topsy-Turvily-bound book! That is, the cover is perfectly
and symmetrically correct; but, open it,—and I find that the
last page is the first, and the whole story of MARLBOROUGH is up-
side down! Never was there such a thorough upset of history.
Let us, however, get it right side up, and then, without
gymnastics, the Baron can duly read the letterpress and admire
the pictures, which, with the exception of some of the eccentric
ones, will somewhat disappoint the admirers of CARAN D'ACHE,
though even these friendly critics will wish that thig artist
had not attempted an imitation of DORE, after the man-
ner of his Conies Drolatiques peculiarities. The story
of MARLBOROUGH is of course something extraordinary, but 'tis
nothing to the tail of MARLBOROUOH'S horse, as shown in the
frontispiece, where "Malbrouk s'en va-t-en guerre" and is
evidently receiving an ovation. The series finishes appropriately
with little figures in black and grey marching in the funeral
procession of the great Duke, " qui, en/in, ne reviendra pas."
minimal Land (DENT & Co.), by SYBIL and KATHARINE CORBET,
with an introduction by Mr. ANDREW LANG, is a delightful non-
sense-picture book, exhibiting the creative faculty of the juvenile
author who, Mr. LANG tells us, is only a four-year-old! Certainly
she is the winner of the Nursery Stakes. This Sybil-line book
has already inspired our Prehistoric Artist.
THE BARON DE B.-W.
MESCAL INTOXICATION.—A writer in the Contemporary Review
describes his sensations when under the influence of the Mexican
drug, produced from the Anhalonium Lewinii cactus, originally
discovered by a German professor. The English experimenter
saw a wonderful variety of gorgeous visions, ending with human
figures " fantastic and Chinese in character." Is it possible that
another German, much more exalted than the professor, habitu-
ally eats this Mexican haschisch, with results precisely similar?
Or is the Anhalonium Lewinii a different plant, though of the
same family as the Anhalonium Wilhelmii superbissimi?

THE POET PAST AND PRESENT.
THE Poet is popularly supposed to have
a soul which soars above mundane things;
we can see him as he appeared in 1838,
with his "eye in a fine frenzy rolling,"
while be indited verses such as the follow-
ing, which duly appeared in that part of
the local newspaper known as Poet's
Corner" : —
1838.
Once Cupid, 'tis said,
In March of a bfld,
Distractedly soujrht far and wide,
"Each rose bnars a thorn,
My wings will be torn
Before I find shelter," he cried.
About to despair,
He finds a couch whfre
HP slumbers in blissful repose.
For surelv he lies
In CBLIA'S eves,
Which violet blossoms disclose.
But this is a practical age. The Poet has
not ceased to twang his lyre; on the con-
trary, he sings louder than ever, and to
some purpose, as the following elegant
extract from the advertisement columns
of the Surrey Comet will testify.
The lay is too long to give in extenso',
we quote one stanza only : —

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BABES.
THE Great Drury Lane Annual is in many respects greater than
ever. Of not a few pantomimes it may be said, "Magnificent,
but not comic"; but The Babe* in the Wood at Old Drury,
where, only a short while since, Druriolanus Maximus was auto-
cratic, besides being brilliant as a spectacle, is artistically excel-
lent in its scenic effects and in its rare combinations of colour;
while for rollicking nonsensical fun there are at least four
capital scenes, of which the last, "The Corner of the Paddock
and the Racecourse," is in itself a cleverly-contrived burlesque
of a great "sporting melodrama," which was, some few years
ago, the great attraction of an Autumn season at Drury Lane.
The Treasury of Ancient Drury, as well as the parents of The
Babes, Messrs. ARTHUR COLLINS and ARTHUR STURGESS, should
profit considerably by this Pantomime, for excellently well have
the two ARTHURS achieved their ''joint Arthiir^bip." To the

Madame GRIOOLATI (as merry as a Grig-olati), and her flying
fairies, beats the record even of Drury Lane's great shows.
DAN LENO, as the boy, never appears, speaks, dances, or sings
without evoking bursts of uncontrollable laughter; and his com-
panion, HERBERT CAMPBELL, as the Babe-sister, is "immense."
| The two robbers, Messrs. GRIFFIN and DITBOIS, are equally
amusing as actors and acrobats. ERNEST D'AUBAN ably sus-
I tains the ancient name and family reputation for ballet and
! pantomime, while in Mr. JOHN A. WARDEN, as the Baron Ban-
bury, Mr. EDWARD TERRY might any day find an alter ego to
play for him. After the uproarious fun, the most popular inci-
dent is a noiseless and exceptionally-graceful dance by the Prince
and his future bride, for which Miss ROBINSON and Miss ADA
BLANCHE could obtain a triple encore any night they may have
time to take it. From beginning to end, for grand spectacle,
artistic effects, and capital fun, the Babes at Drury Lane take
the Twelfth Night cake, and behave themselves so admirably
that it is impossible to beat them.
Enter Dan Lcno and Herbert Campbell. "The Babes."
indefatigable J. M. GLOVER, their most energetically-active Right
Hand (and Glover) Man (more power to his elbow and
baton!), is due all praise for the music which, having cleverly
"composed" it, sagaciously "selected" it, and admirably "ar-
ranged" it, he convincingly conducts with arms, legs, head, and
eyeglass; now upstanding, while, as a musical ^Eolus, he directs
"the wind" on the stage, ever and anon keeping watchful eyes
and ears for the strings, cymbals, and big drum in the orchestra.
The Babes themselves, Messrs. DAN LENO and HERBERT CAMP-
BELL, with the Prince Paragon of Pantomime, Miss ADA
BLANCHE, all harmoniously working together, have done their
very best, and will continue to do it nightly, in order to keep
up the well-earned reputation of Old Drury, as the ancient home
of genuine English Pantomime.
The scenic artists have done wonders. Anything more per-
fectly designed and painted than Mr. HENRY EMDEN'S "Prince's
Gardens" has rarely been equalled, still more rarely (if ever)
excelled. It is a splendid specimen of how great an illusion can
be effected on a simple "cloth." Examine it carefully through
a good opera-glass. Then there is the Panorama by KAUTSKY, a
beautiful work of scenic art; the Mushroom Meadow, a quaintly-
clever arrangement by BRUCE SMITH; and once again Mr. HENRY
EMDEN compels universal applause for his last scene of all,
wherein takes place the coronation of the Prince, ADA BLANCHE,
who is united to his blushing 3/an'on, Miss VIOLET ROBINSON,
who, as the bride, appears in "gorgeous" array. This last scene
for combination of colour, for original stage contrivances, for
grouping on what may be termed "the gangway," and for the
space above occupied by the graceful Queen Humming Bird,
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THERE are few men more capable than Dr. GEORGE SMITH of
doing justice to the task he has set himself in sketching the lives
and accomplishments of Twehv Indian Statesmen (JOHN MURRAY).
The muster roll is a blazon of honour: CHARLES GRANT, Sir
HENRY LAWRENCE, Lord LAWRENCE, Sir JAMXS OUTRAM, Sir
DONALD M'Lgoo, Sir HENRY DURAND, COLIN MACKENZIE, Sir
HERBERT EDWARDES, JOHN CLARK MARSHMAN, Sir HENRY MAINE,
Sir HENRY RAMSAY, and Sir CHARLES AITCHISON. Of the dozen,
Dr. SMITH, himself a distinguished Anglo-Indian, knew all save
one, counting some as intimate friends. With the double advan-
tage of personal acquaintance, and of familiarity with social life
and political events in India, Dr. SMITH is able to re-illumine the
brilliant pathway of these noble lives. The twelve chapters
compose a fascinating study of what may be done by the English,
man abroad. My Baronite uses that term for the sake of con-
venience. As Dr. SMITH sets forth in a striking passage. Great
Britain and Ireland have been thoroughly united in building up
the Empire of India. CLIVE and WARREN HASTINGS were Eng-
lish ; Lord MINTO, the Marquis of HASTINGS, and Lord DALHOUSIE
were Scotch; Ireland helped to make the QUEEN Empress of
India by giving birth to the Marquis of WBLLESLEY, and to the
heroic trio of LAWRENCES—GEORGE, HENRY, and JOHN.
I am the fortunate possessor of a copy of The Story of Marl-
borough, illustrated by CARAN D'ACHB (H. GREVEL & Co.), with
descriptive text by the Hon. FRANCES WOLSELEY. This work
is, I hope, unique, as being so, it will be. in years to come,
invaluable. The particular copy that now lies open before me
is a Topsy-Tvrvily-bound book! That is, the cover is perfectly
and symmetrically correct; but, open it,—and I find that the
last page is the first, and the whole story of MARLBOROUGH is up-
side down! Never was there such a thorough upset of history.
Let us, however, get it right side up, and then, without
gymnastics, the Baron can duly read the letterpress and admire
the pictures, which, with the exception of some of the eccentric
ones, will somewhat disappoint the admirers of CARAN D'ACHE,
though even these friendly critics will wish that this artist
had not attempted an imitation of DORE, after the man-
ner of his Contes Drolatiquei peculiarities. The story
of MARLBOROUOH is of course something extraordinary, but 'tis
nothing to the tail of MARLBOROUOH'S horse, as shown in the
frontispiece, where "Malbrouk s'en va-t-en guerre" and is
evidently receiving an ovation. The series finishes appropriately
with little figures in black and grey marching in the funeral
procession of the great Duke, " 7111, enfin, ne reviendra pas."
Animal Land (DENT & Co.), by SYBIL and KATHARINE CORBET,
with an introduction by Mr. ANDREW LANG, is a delightful non-
sense-picture book, exhibiting the creative faculty of the juvenile
author who, Mr. LANG tells us, is only a four-year-old! Certainly
she is the winner of the Nursery Stakes. This Sybil-line book
has already inspired our Prehistoric Artist.

another German, much more exalted than the professor, habitu-
j ally eats this Mexican haschisch, with results precisely similar?

ground that you can't have a "shot"

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.J
No. VII.—To THK MARQUIS OF SALISBURY.
MY LOBD,—In moments of depression it has sometimes occurred
to me to speculate as to whether you really exist. Is there, in
truth, such a person as the popular mind variously conceives the
present Marquis of SALISBURY to be, and is this person in his
actual corporeal existence at this moment Prime Minister and
Secretary of State for Foreign Aifairsp Is it possible, I say to
myself, that a real living man can be at once vigorous and feeble,
determined and vacillating, cautious and blazmgly indiscreet, a
man of affairs and a devotee of science, a public speaker of merit
and a shrinking recluse, the chief of a turbulent democracy and
a cynic steeped in aristocratic prejudices, a patriot minister and
a craven conceder of bis country's just rights? No, the combina-
tion seems impossible; all these contradictions stagger me, and
I find myself driven to the verge of believing that the speakers
and statesmen of both our great parties have invented, each for
his own purpose, a convenient figure, a variable avatar, and have
labelled it with a noble name so that they may have some definite
object for their hopes, their fears, their admirations, or their
dislikes. In support of this theory, a man might plausibly allege
that, of hiii1, at any rate, your personal influence has made itsell
but little felt either in the councils of the great powers of Europe
or in those of the Unionist party. The Lord SALISBURY ot whom
Radical speakers declare that he is an unbending representative
of the highest and driest and least popular principles of musty
Toryism, who, as Lord ROBERT CECIL, resigned his office rathei
than countenance the passing of a bill for electoral reform, who
is, if one may use the phrase, red in tooth and claw with the
life-blood of Liberal measures—how, in any case, can this be the
Lord SALISBURY who follows submissively in the wake of Mr.
JOSEPH (JiiAMiiKui AIN , and alienates Lord LONDONDERRY by carry-
ing an Employers' Liability Act safely through the storms 01
the House of Lords? Can we recognise in the man who
threatens the SULTAN with the vengeance of Heaven, but shrinks
from enforcing the spiritual menace by a fleet of warships, that
stern opponent of autocratic ambition who helped to restore the
tottering power of the Turk, and wrested Peace with Honour
from the embattled legions of the Russian CZAR P
I might pursue this antithetical path much longer, but I re-
frain. For after all, if you embody many contradictious, it is
only because, in spite of your rugged speech and leonine appear-
ance, you are more frankly human than most of those who
•upport or who criticise you. Nature moulded you to be a man
of thought, slow, critical, deliberate, and careful. The tyrannous
force of circumstances, coupled with your own high and chival-
rous sense of all that a great name and high position required ol
a man, has driven you out on a tempestuous career, in which
constant perils demand swift resolution and undaunted action.
The time is out of joint: that much you feel and know, but
you feel with a more assured certainty that the spite is indeed a
cursed one which has laid upon you of all men the heavy burden
of setting it right. Leave it alone, you murmur to yourself;
touch it with care, you say in some Primrose League oration, and
suddenly, lo and behold, you find yourself tinkering, and hammer-
ing, and dovetailing and cutting away like any journeyman
carpenter of the rest of them, but without the journeyman
carpenter's conviction that his work will improve instead of
utterly destroying. Thus your malignant fate, working even
more effectively than your own honourable ambition to serve
your country, has made you the chief of the Conservative party
at a time when most of those who act with it seem to have de-
termined that there is but little in the constitution and govern-
ment of the State that is worthy of conservation. Occasionally
you blaze forth into an outspoken revolt against yourself and
them, and during the days that succeed the columns of the
newspapers that support your party teem with denials, attenua-
tions and explanations, while on platform after platform sorely-
perplexed Conservative orators cover the black patches of your
speech each with his own particular coat of whitewash. It is an
amusing spectacle, and not least amusing, I take it, to you, if
ever in the pleasant retirement of Hatfield or amid the anxious
work of the Foreign Office you trouble yourself to give another
thought to the matter. And in any case it must have been a
relief to you to liberate your soul, whatever may be the conse-
quences, and to strike a panic into the despised minds of those
whose thoughts ;u» bent on the retention or on the acquisition,
quocuntnie modo, of votes and voters.
Whether or not a political party is best served by such a
leader may be left to others to determine. It is idle to deny
that, now that politics know Mr. GLADSTONE no longer, you are
by far the most interesting figure in public life. You puzzle,

HUMANITY'S BEST FRIEND.
Sartorial Artist. "THOSE WILL BE ALL THE MEASVREMENTS I SHALL
REQUIRE, SIH,VTHANK YOU. AND NOW WHAT SORT OF SHOULDERS
WOULD YOU PREFER I I UHODLD_RECOXMEND THE MILITARY SHOUL-
DER TO HATCH THE MOUSTACHE F"
speeches are forced to think. You do not juggle with words,
nor do you bandy empty compliments. Your thoughts and the
words in which you express them are no mere pale reflection of
the minds of others. They are your own, instinct with a definite
personality, and they are more often than not unexpected. For
the actions that follow on these words and often give them a
flat denial, you are not wholly responsible, for when the time for
action comes, others assert themselves, and fortunately or un-
fortunately impede you. And it may be that to you action is
merely a choice of evils, a process far less important than the
utterance of an honest personal conviction. "Thinking a thing,"
as JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL says in one of his essays, "becomes
better than doing it, and thought with its easy perfection,
capable of everything because it can accomplish everything with
ideal means, is vastly more attractive and satisfactory than deed,
which must be wrought at best with imperfect instruments, and
always falls short of the conception that went before it."
I conclude, my Lord, by wishing you many years of undi-
minished activity. For it is well that our political life should
still have power to attract men of ancient lineage and of high
and unblemished character. You have known what it means to
struggle in early days against adversity, and you have fought
your way to the great position you occupy by sheer force of
intellect and energy. Whatever may be your choice, whether
you continue to devote your powers to the public service or seek
a well-earned rest from the labours of the State, you can always
count upon the high respect of your fellow-countrymen, even of
those amongst them who have most strenuously opposed you.
I am, my Lord, always faithfully yours, THK VAGRANT.

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.]
No. VII.—To THE MARQUIS OF SALISBURY.
MY LORD,—In moments of depression it has som«times occurred
to me to speculate as to whether you really exist. Is there, in
truth, such a person as the popular mind variously conceives the
present Marquis of SALISBURY to be, and is this person in his
actual corporeal existence at this moment Prime Minister and
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs P Is it possible, I say to
myself, that a real living man can be at once vigorous and feeble,
determined and vacillating, cautious and blazingly indiscreet, a
man of affairs and a devotee of science, a public speaker of merit
and a shrinking recluse, the chief of a turbulent democracy and
a cynic steeped in aristocratic prejudices, a patriot minister and
a craven conceder of his country's just rights r No, the combina-
tion seems impossible; all these contradictions stagger me, and
I find myself driven to the verge of believing that the speakers
and statesmen of both our great parties have invented, each for
his own purpose, a convenient figure, a variable avatar, and have
labelled it with a noble name so that they may have some definite
object for their hopes, their fears, their admirations, or their
dislikes. In support of this theory, a man might plausibly allege
that, of lair, at any rate, your personal influence nas made itself
but little felt either in the councils of the great powers of Europe
or in those of the Unionist party. The Lord SALISBURY of whom
Radical speakers declare that he is an unbending representative
of the highest and driest and least popular principles of musty
Toryism, who, as Lord ROBERT CECIL, resigned his office rathei
than countenance the passing of a bill for electoral reform, who
is, if one may use the phrase, red in tooth and claw with the
life-blood of Liberal measures—how, in any case, can this be the
Lord SALISBURY who follows submissively in the wake of Mr.
JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, and alienates Lord LONDONDERRY by carry-
ing an Employers' Liability Act safely through the storms 01
the House of Lords? Can we recognise in the man who
threatens the SULTAN with the vengeance of Heaven, but shrinks
from enforcing the spiritual menace by a fleet of warships, that
stern opponent of autocratic ambition who helped to restore the
tottering power of the Turk, and wrested Peace with Honour
from the embattled legions of the Russian CZAR t
I might pursue this antithetical path much longer, but I re-
frain. For after all, if you embody many contradictious, it is
only because, in spite of your rugged speech and leonine appear-
mnce, you are more frankly human than most of those who
rapport or who criticise you. Nature moulded you to be a man
of uiought, slow, critical, deliberate, and careful. The tyrannous
force of circumstances, coupled with your own high and chival-
rous sense of all that a great name and high position required ol
a man, has driven you out on a tempestuous career, in which
constant perils demand swift resolution and undaunted action.
The time is out of joint: that much you feel and know, but
you feel with a more assured certainty that the spite is indeed a
cursed one which has laid upon you of all men the haavy burden
of setting it right. Leave it alone, you murmur to yourself;
touch it with care, you say in some Primrose League oration, and
suddenly, lo and behold, you find yourself tinkering, and hammer-
ing, and dovetailing and cutting away like any journeyman
carpenter of the rest of them, but without the journeyman
carpenter's conviction that his work will improve instead of
utterly destroying. Thus your malignant fate, working even
more effectively than your own honourable ambition to serve
your country, has made you the chief of the Conservative party
at a time when most of those who act with it seem to have de-
termined that there is but little in the constitution and govern-
ment of the State that is worthy of conservation. Occasionally
you blaze forth into an outspoken revolt against yourself and
them, and during the days that succeed the columns of the
newspapers that support your party teem with denials, attenua-
tions and explanations, while on platform after platform sorely-
perplexed Conservative orators cover the black patches of your
speech each with his own particular coat of whitewash. It is an
amusing spectacle, and not least amusing, I take it, to you, if
ever in the pleasant retirement of Hatfield or amid the anxious
work of the Foreign Office you trouble yourself to give another
thought to the matter. And in any case it must nave been a
relief to you to liberate your soul, whatever may be the conse-
quences, and to strike a panic into the despised minds of those
whose thoughts are bent on the retention or on the acquisition,
quocunque modo, of votes and voters.
Whether or not a political party is best served by such a
leader may be left to others to determine. It is idle to deny
that, now that politics know Mr. GLADSTONE no longer, you are
by far the most interesting figure in public life. You puzzle,

HUMANITY'S BEST FRIEND.

speeches are forced to think. You do not juggle with words,
nor do you bandy empty compliments. Your thoughts and the
words in which you express them are no mere pale reflection of
the minds of others. They are your own, instinct with a definite
personality, and they are more often than not unexpected. For
the actions that follow on these words and often give them a
flat denial, you are not wholly responsible, for when the time for
action comes, others assert themselves, and fortunately or un-
fortunately impede you. And it may be that to you action is
merely a choice of evils, a process far less important than the
utterance of an honest personal conviction. "Thinking a thing,"
as JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL says in one of his essays, "becomes
better than doing it. and thought with its easy perfection,
capable of everything because it can accomplish everything with
ideal means, is vastly more attractive and satisfactory than deed,
which must be wrought at best with imperfect instruments, and
always falls short of the conception that went before it."
I conclude, my Lord, by wishing you many years of undi-
minished activity. For it is well that our political life should
still have power to attract men of ancient lineage and of high
and unblemished character. You have known what it means to
struggle in early days against adversity, and you have fought
your way to the great position you occupy by sheer force of
intellect and energy. Whatever may be your choice, whether
you continue to devote your powers to the public service or seek
a well-earned rest from the labours of the State, you can always
count upon the high respect of your fellow-countrymen, even of
those amongst them who have most strenuously opposed you.
I am, my Lord, always faithfully yours, THE VAGRANT.

newspapers that support your party teem with denials, attenua-
tions and explanations, while on platform after platform sorely-
perplexed Conservative orators cover the black patches of your
speech each with his own particular coat of whitewash. It is an
amusing spectacle, and not least amusing, I take it, to you, if
ever in the pleasant retirement of Hat Held or amid the anxious
work of the Foreign Office you trouble yourself to give another
thought to the matter. And in any case it must nave been a
relief to you to liberate your soul, whatever may be the conse-
quences, and to strike a panic into the despised minds of those
whose thoughts are bent on the retention or on the acquisition,
qunrinn/UP modo, of votes and voters.
Whether or not a political party is best served by such a
leader may be left to others to determina. It is idle to deny
that, now that politics know Mr. GLADSTONE no longer, you are
by far the most interesting figure in public life. You puzzle,

HUMANITY'S BEST FRIEND.

DER TO MATCH THE MOUSTACHE f"
speeches are forced to think. You do not juggle with words,
nor do you bandy empty compliments. Your thoughts and the
words in which you express them are no mere pale reflection of
the minds of others. They are your own, instinct with a definite
personality, and they are more often than not unexpected. For
the actions that follow on these words and often give them a
flat denial, you are not wholly responsible, for when the time for
action comes, others assert themselves, and fortunately or un-
fortunately impede you. And it may be that to you action is
merely a choice of evils, a process far less important than the
utterance of an honest personal conviction. "Thinking a thing,"
as JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL says in one of his essays, "becomes
better than doing it, and thought with its easy perfection,
capable of everything because it can accomplish everything with
ideal means, is vastly more attractive and satisfactory than deed,
which must be wrought at best with imperfect instruments, ana
always falls short of the conception that went before it."
I conclude, my Lord, by wishing you many years of undi-
minished activity. For it is well that our political life should
still have power to attract men of ancient lineage and of high
and unblemished character. You have known what it means to
struggle in early days against adversity, and you have fought
your way to the great position you occupy by sheer force of
intellect and energy. Whatever may be your choice, whether
you continue to devote your powers to the public service or seek
a well-earned rest from the labours of the State, you can always
count upon the high respect of your fellow-countrymen, even of
those amongst them who have most strenuously opposed you.
I am, my Lord, always faithfully yours, THE VAOBANT.

A Sentimental Rliymsler espies an early Bud in

I SEE a little bud to-day
That fills me with delight.
Fair as the blooms of later May
That scent the Summer night,
A little bud of smallest worth,:
That rises from its bed.
All pushed aside the leaf-strewn earth
To which its root was wed 1
A little bud, but still the first
To point its little way,
All eager, hungry and athirst,
To taste the joy of day I
All venturesome its path to cleave
And this great world to know;
Restless its mother-mould to leave,
Not recking ice or snow!
Perchance it might the cold withstand,
And blossom into flower,
Or perish 'neath the ruthless hand,
Only a snowdrop to recall
Your message of To be,
That token of the After All
That made the Past for me I
For you were Snowdrop in the Past
Before the Springtime came,
When skies were dull and overcast,
"Twas then I gave your name!
I watched your tenderness arise
Amid tho arid land,
You heeded not the loving eyes
You could not understand.
But yet I send this bud to you
In token of those days,
Before I M bidden long adieu
To victory and bays.
This little bud I M ask you wear
In proof of Love not dead!
I pluck it. Horror I I declare
'Tis but a crocus head 1

[" Mr. LE GALLIENNE'S proposal that millionaire*

WHINB'BB I walk the public ways,
How many poor that lack ablution
Do probe my heart with pensive gaze,
Ami beg a trivial contribution I
When they accost me as "My Lord"
And pray that Heaven may guard my
going,
It cuts my vitals like a sword
To check my charity from flowing;
To pass them by as though my ear
Had missed their genial observations,
And subsequently in the rear
To catch a stream of imprecations.
Perchance not all of these were born
To crave the desultory copper;
They were not ever thus forlorn,
But came a paralyzing cropper.
Haply beneath those rude outsides,
In substance scant, in texture scaly,
Some mute inglorious BARNTTM hides,
Or else an undeveloped BAILEY.
But sadder still it is to see,
Advancing down the gutter's hollow,
Some sandwichman that used to be
Closely connected with Apollo!
Where now from shoulders slightly wrung
You note the blatant boards suspended,
In front—the living lyre was slung,
Behind—the lustrous mane descended I
Within that mane the birds of song
Would build their nests and lightly
carol,
What time the owner moved along
In beauteous velveteen apparel.
Long since he sold his sounding lyre.
Pruned all his locks and pawned his
raiment;
He works for mere ignoble hire
Because it offers ampler payment.
Tho speaking eye, the godlike brow,
That lips should lave and bosoms
cherish—
We trample on them, we allow
These priceless things to go and perish!
The nations' hides are very hard;
You ask a trifle nett—they grudge it;
You scarcely ever hear a Bard
So much as mentioned in a Budget.
Sweet millionaires I your chance is come;
Yours is the duty and you know it;
Surely your hearts within you hum
To reconstruct the starving Poet I

Come, make a paltry puncture in
Your swollen wealth of tyre and Sidon I
Sell those ancestral halls and let

And, by a touch of humour, get

there was no sign of human life. The death-like silence was only
broken by the strange hissing sound as, far above my head,
gigantic coal-scuttles rushed through the air. In the front or
each gleamed a brilliant search-light. Each seemed to have three
elastic tentacles terminating in a scoop, which it trailed along
the ground as if seeking for its prey. Once a dreadful shriek
thrilled through the air, and a hundred yards from me I saw a

brighter. Occasionally a shower of coal fell upon my head. At

About the year 1900 its unsuspected vitality became less dor-

MAJESTAETSBEI.EIDIGUNG.— The brave Editor of our German

of Humanitfittbrleidignna, for which some punishment could be
OUR BOYS. WHAT TO DO WITH THEM?
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I am sure you will open your sympa-
thetic columns to the despair of a father who is left with three
marriageable but unmarried sons on his hands. What is to be-
come of them? Listen to my story, and then, if you can,
wonder that I complain.
Knowing that my boys would be left without a competence,
and unwilling to trust them to the uncertain chances of matri-
mony, I decided to give them such a training as would fit them
to find for themselves. JOHNNIE, my eldest, would be a bar-
rister. I shuddered at the expense, but the poor boy was bent
on it, and there was just a chance that he might become devil
to Miss S—;—, the great Q.C., in which case I was not without
hope that his pretty ways and winning smile might bring him an
offer of marriage. Dejusion fond! It was a father's dream!
Miss S took in a niece of her own, and poor JOHNNIE, after
waiting years for the briefs that never came, had to give up the
Bar. He now teaches in a Kindergarten^ where he lectures the
infants on conchology, and gives practical demonstrations on
the shell of a periwinkle.
TOM, my second, was all for surgery. I knew it was madness
for a boy to enter what is par excellence a woman's profession,
but he would not listen to my reasons. Failure, in his case, was
a foregone conclusion, and it is perhaps surprising that he keeps
himself in hats and gloves by nursing a cantankerous old lady.
PHILIP, my youngest, was always a domesticated boy, and
showed no desire for a learned profession. This gave me no small
relief, and as Oxford and Bart's had run away with so much
money, and done so little for my eldest sons, I determined to
send PHILIP to the Board School. Here he had a brilliant
career, taking numerous prizes in cookery and laundry-work. As
soon as he left school, he obtained a situation as " General," and
at the present moment he is enjoying what in these days is a
sinecure, as gentleman's help in a country vicarage. He cooks,
cleans the boots, and does the housework for the family and
paying guests; baths the babies and tutors the children when
not otherwise engaged. In return for this he gets a Christian
home, and half-a-crown a week.
Now, Mr. Punch, I ask you, what are we to do with our sons?
The overcrowding of the professions is an old, ojd story. Women
won't marry—HHir boys remain bachelors. Wrhat else is left?
Domestic service.? I have tried it, and after my experience,- I
put it to you, Sir, can it be recommended?

[" The ' Moody Manners Opera Company Limited ' hag just been registered

EXCELLENT 1 "Moody manners" should always be strictly
limited in company. But is this a company for limiting "moody
manners," or does MOODY MANNERS wish; as his name suggests,
to limit his company? If the former, it is a magnum opus, and
needs a company accustomed to such weighty opera. This seems
to exclude light Opera, which, considering the purpose of the
company, is a pity. Perhaps, however, it is not all "moody
manners that are to be limited, but only manners of some
moods—imperative manners, for instance, or manners indicative
of bad breeding. Even so, the present company has a future
before it in helping to make the imperfect perfect, so that public
interest in its moods would be in-tense.
It is to be hoped no shares will be issued to the public, in order
to avoid increasing the numbers who already have a share of
"moody manners." They should be kept as far as possible in one
Hand, at any rate until the company can feel its feet. It must
be pointed out that limited liability in this connection is no
new idea, for in Mr. Punch's company the jiability to "moody
manners " has always been extremely limited, in fact non-existent.
To BE LET ON LEASE.—Some valuable properties on the sea-
coast. Fine marine views. Good boating. No restrictions on

OUR GIELS. WHAT TO GIVE THEM?
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—When my sisters went off to the cricket-
field on a fine summer morning, and left me at home to darn the
socks and overhaul the washing, I used to feel the bitterness of
things and to blame Fate 'that had made me a man. But
experience has taught me that few changes are so fraught with
evil as not to bring some compensating good, and even in this
latterday reversal of the sexes, I find a drop of consolation which
goes far to reconcile me to my altered lot.
The problem, "What to give our girls? " is one that vexes all
men, and as I have at last solved it, a list of my presents will,
I am convinced, be of interest and value to your readers. To
KATE, who is a cricket enthusiast, I have given a cane-spliced
bat and a pair of pads. The latter she has buckled on, and with
the former in her hands, she studies her positions in the looking-
glass all day, and slogs imaginary "fours." MART, who is no
mean pugilist, would now treat suede and kid with equal scorn:
I have, therefore, presented her with a pair of boxing-gloves,
and she may now be seen in her bedroom sparring at a bladder
from ten to four. NELLIE, who is something of a scorcher, used
to complain, that her road-racing records were always being spoilt
by stupid deaf old gentlemen, who would keep getting knocked
down. I have bought her the loudest and best bicycle bell in
the market, and she has now ridden for a fortnight without a
casualty. JANK is captain of her College Fiftoon, and I am
working her the Girton arms upon a football jersey. As my
little gift was not ready in time, I bought her an interim present
of a hundred cigarettes, \\hen Papa is not about she lets me
whiff one with her, and she says it is a pity I am not a girl, for

AN ERA OF PALMISTRY.—The Era Almanack for 1898 contains

but they are decidedly striking. Mrs. KEELEY'S takes the palm.
Though the hands are scored with lines, yet no one hand exactly
indicates the line its owner has taken professionally. Nothing
delights an actor more than "getting a hand," and here each
provides the requisite applause for himself. Should the Editor
wish to continue the series he will simply have to advertise, " All
hands to the Era!"
OLD MASTERS AT THE GRAFTON GALLERY.
MR. SELI.AR, nobly emulous of the example of Mr. HENRY TATE
has been desirous of dedicating his private collection of pictures
to the enjoyment of the public. The idea is excellent. Two
Tetei are, as the French say, better than one. Indeed, we could
dp with any number such as HENRY. But there are pictures and
pictures, and the SBLLAR Collection, not to put too fine a point
upon it, is not quite equal to the TATE. A committee of experts
called upon to adjudge the merits of the collection, advised
the London Corporation, to whose care the collection was com-
mitted, to decline the charge. Mr. SELLAR, appealing to Cfesar,
now displays his pictures at the Grafton Gallery and invites the
public to decide between his taste and that of the committee over
which the P.R.A. presided.
The other night, TOBY, M.P., supping with GEORGE GROSSMITH
at the festival given at the Grafton in celebration of GEE GEE'S
golden wedding (Eheu ! how time flies), had an opportunity of see-
in<r the pictures. He is glad to think he seized it before supper.
Otherwise, gazing upon these things in gilt frames, he would have
suspected an access of nightmare. Old Masters they are called—
old beyond recognition. Where a single man, of whatsoever active
habits could have picked them up, is matter for fresh marvel.
The probability is, Mr. SELLAR was assisted in his generous
labour by a procession of the gentlemen to be met with in country
districts who go about with an oil-painting tucked under either
arm, and will "let you have the pair for fifteen bob" if you
don't happen to have three guineas.
The Gallery was crowded, and there was some idea among
GEE GEE'S guests of buying "Three Cuyps and a Cow "—a rare
specimen of the Master's earliest manner—and presenting it to
the venerable host as a memento of the interesting occasion.
But it came to nothing.

LADY WARWICK has done a womanly and a graceful thing (but
that s tautology, my Baronite says) in volunteering to edit the

has written a preface in which the wife of a great Warwickshire
andlord extols the work of the Warwickshire agricultural
labourer who started and led to bloodless victory one of the
greatest revolutions of the century. When JOSEPH ARCH, dress-
ing himself in a pair of cord trowsers, a cord vest, and an old
flannel jacket, went out on the 7th of Feb., 1872, to address the
gaunt and hungry crowd gathered under a spreading chestnut
tree at Wellesbourne, the agricultural labourer was in a parlous
state. In Warwickshire his wage was twelve shillings a week,
and indignant farmers told him he ought to be ashamed of him.

nine shillings. "He had no organisation." Lady WARWICK

the professional agitator ignored him. He had no vote; the
politician passed him by." How all this was changed JOSEPH
ARCH tells in simple, graphic fashion. The stout volume has the
double attraction of describing a great political episode, and re-

A HAPPY RETURN.
Nor only like "le petit bonhomme" does
the sprightly Circus Girl "vit encore"
at the Gaiety, but she is growing younger
as she gets on (a circus girl is always get-
ting on and off—her horse), and spright-
lier than ever. With the most welcome
return of Miss KU.AI.INE TKBRISS to the
Gaiety Theatre, The Circui Girl seams to
have obtained a new lease of life, without
there having been any ordinary signs of
the former lease having nearly run out.
Its last nights are not yet within anything
like measurable distance. The piece is
so constructed, on a sort of elastic hold-all
principle, as to enable it to accommodate
everything and anything in the way of
music, song, dance, or dialogue, that the
astute Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES may see fit
to cram into it. And that this plan is
appreciated by the public is evident, to
quote the Bard,
"As may appear by EDWARD'S good success,"
which line, when found in the Third Part
of Henry the Sixth, Act III., Sc. 3, the
reader may, an' it so please him, "make a
note of." En attendant Vive GEOROK I.,

LADY WARWICK has done a womanly and a graceful thing (but
that's tautology, my Baronite says) in volunteering to edit the
life of Joseph Arch (HUTCHINSON) . She has done more. She
has written a preface in which the wife of a great Warwickshire
landlord extols the work of the Warwickshire agricultural
labourer who started and led to bloodless victory one of the
greatest revolutions of the century. When JOSEPH ARCH, dress-
ing himself in a pair of cord trowsers, a cord vest, and an old
flannel jacket, went out on the 7th of Feb., 1872, to address the
gaunt and hungry crowd gathered under a spreading chestnut
tree at Wellesbourne, the agricultural labourer was in a parlous
state. In Warwickshire his wage was twelve shillings a week,
and indignant farmers told him he ought to be ashamed of him-
self asking for more, since down in Devonshire it did not exceed
nine shillings. "He had no organisation," Lady WARWICK
writes; "the Trades Unions let him alone. He had no money;
the professional agitator ignored him. He had no vote; the
politician passed him by." How all this was changed JOSEPH
ARCH tell* in simple, graphic fashion. The stout volume has the
double attraction of describing a great political episode, and re-

traglichen, Hunger and Thirst who me during unbeiievely long-
weily Hours as one unluckly in one iniddleagely Castle inshutted
Prisoner tortured, Voyage in London, the Headtown Englands, at.
I voyage from Dover in the towards Londonbritsch at the
Midday going Train away. I have to the Overwaiter, to the
Portier. to the Hausknecht, Houseknight—ach nein, man say in
Englisch "the Shoes "—and to yet other Persons, in the Hand
one Drinkgold pressed. Even so mutsch Drinkgoid as in Wien I
I had only german Gold, so have i the Reckoning therewith
payed, but i have something in the Change lost. Lucklywise had
i some german Fiftypfennigebits for the Drinkgolds. The Diener-
ichaft seemed not very content, i know not why. But in the
Railstation give i one Fiftypfennigebit to the Packagecarrier,
and he say, No. Maunsiah, not gud." Warum sagen sie alle,
"Maunsiah " I See i as one Frencher out? Unpossibly! It
are Frenchers who siemly fat are, but they are so short. I am
not thin, but i am high as the most Prussiers. I inhabited one-
time in Munchen, so drink i Bier yet willinger as the Berliners,
and man say that the Muncheners so fat are, because they so
mutsch Bier drink.
Also say i to the Packagecarrier, " It is queit gud, it is german
Silver." "No blumin—was ist das f—german Silver sixpenses
for me," call he, "its passin bad munny, yud git in quod—was
ist das?—for it, if i split on yer—Himmel, was sagt er?—so make
it too bob—was ist das?—and i say Nothing." "I understand
not," anser i, "what wish You? Have You a Tarif." "Yes,"
say he, "Tarif, too bob, too Schillings." Zwei Mark! Ach,
wie teite.r! England is yet deerer as Wien. I have in the Hotel
Cash some little Money received, and i give him too Schilling.
Then step i in the Waggon up, and he say, as the Train away go,
"Thanky, Maunsiah." Noch wifder!
What for one little Coupe! The Trains in England are not as
in Prussia. There have we Waegons thro covered Gangways
farther. Now am i in one little Coupl, without Heet, without
Food, inshutted, and hier must i sit remain, because it no
Korridor along the Train is. I have only one Voyagefellow, one
old Lady. She sit next to the Window, who wide opened is.
The Weather is not Kold, but it is unpossibly in the January,
without Heetiug, so to voyage. "Beg, gracious Woman," say i,
"permit You to me the Window totomake." And i make it to.
"No, thank You," say she, "i prefer it open." "What," call i,
"You wish the Window opened in the January, inthismiserabel,
kold, englisch Waggon? It is unpossibly I" "We must have
some Air," say she, but she shut it a little. Himmel! The old
englisch Lady;, are strong. The fresh Air in the Summer some-
times is sound, gesund; she is very daugerly, gefdhrlich, in the
Winter. In the german Railwaywaggon Kom she never.
Lucklywise am i with mein Voyagecover, too Overcoats, and
one Mantel, called in Germany "Havelock," covered, and like-
wise kan I smoke because the Coupe not Nicht-Baucher inscribed
is. I kindle mein Cigar at. "Oh I" call the old Lady,
•'Smoking is not allowed." "Beg," i anser, "this Coupe is not
Not-Smoker." "This is not a Smokingcarridge," say she.
'' Forgive," say i, a little angry, "this is not Not Smoking. So
kan i smoke. You shud not hierin kom." Meenweil the Train
thro several Tunnels, where the Air yet colder is, go, and then
halt he. "Garde I" call the old Lady. Was ist das? Ach, der
tichaffner! The old Lady spiek, he spiek, i spiek. We are all
angry. Endly understand i that in England man only in the
Coupe, as in France "Fumeurs" inscribed, smoke. "I go also
in one other Waggon," say i. "No Time," say the Garde, the
Train go, and there must i the whole Voyage with the old Lady,
and the fresh Air, and without Cigars, remain. Donnerwetter!
At the next Railstation dare i not outtostep, because the stop-
ping so short, is. One half Hour later become the Heaven quiet
dark. It is too Clock. Wie spnderbar! The Train halt. No
Railstation. I am hungry. If i only in Prussia were, now would

PROSPECTUS.
1. This Company is formed to acquire the well-known and old-
established business ot iVir. UOLLINOS, Crossing-sweeper, ot Upper
Brook Street, \\ ., and that 01 .Mr. KILL MUUGINB, notessioual
Cab-tollower, oi lioiidon-witum-iiie-Katlius.
-. It is proposed to ettect an amalgamation of the above-
mentioned niguly remunerative and prosperous concerns, under
a scheme ot nuancutl unification, tne respective working stalls
and plant remaining distinct, as heretofore.
3. Tne question of "perks," over and above legitimate earn-
ings, to be settled by private treaty between the Vendor and
his Patrons.
4. The remarkably prosperous undertaking of the Vendor was
first initiated fourteen years ago, when the goodwill ot a sound,
attractive, and welt-organised street-crossing in Mayfair was
taken over for a consideration by the present Vendor, first as a
locum teiiens, and subsequently in permanency, all out-standing
claims and liabilities having been settled with tne aid of a broom-
stick. From the commencement the annual turnover has been
on a largely increasing scale, owing to the adoption of business-
like methods, and to the masterly inactivity of the Local Vestry,
combined with a judicious nictitation of the eye of the adjacent
policeman for the time being. The weather has been almost
consistently muddy and favourable for a steady high average of
takings, and there is every prospect that this desirable state of
a I fair- will continue. Among the Vendor's Patrons are numbered
some of the most exquisitely-shod wearers of patent-leather
among the British aristocracy, and not a few short-sighted .and
timorous old ladies of a thoroughly reliable and benevolent
character.
5. The contemplated Cab-Running branch of the joint under-
taking is a later development, but is already productive of a
splendid dividend, the initial outlay being extremely small. Mr.
MUGGINS has attended to his customers on a scientific and im-
partial system, and it is felt that the time has arrived to invite
the Public at large to co-operate cordially in the exploitation of
his eloquent and unrivalled methods in the pursuit of travelling-
trunks and the cajolement of their owners.
6. It will be readily recognised that the proposed venture is
totally distinct from speculative schemes of the " wild-cat" order,
and it is therefore scarcely necessary or advisable to present an
estimate of the expenses (which are merely nominal, consisting in
the purchase of one broom), and of the profits, which are likely

I HATE your foreign manners—hat in hand
To surly cabman and officious bobby.
Your comic songs I fail to understand,
I am a tourist ridden by bis hobby.
I hate the way you stare at me, as if
I were a madman, or trick-bear in training,
Because my suit is check—because I whiff
A British pipe, your cigarettes disdaining.
I hate your 'cres tonnerres—your double Dutch
Quips and retorts I find abomination.
An honest English that they cannot touch
(And what is left to your imagination).
Your dishes make me ill—I cannot live
Without a hearty meal at my uprising.
All rolls and coffee would I gladly give
For a small Baas, and steak that's appetising.
They told me that in Paris I should find
My mother tongue on all hands—an illusion.
It was not so, nor can I call to mind
One soul, to whom I spoke without confusion,.
If e'er again I 'm caught in such a pass
Then find me drinking mazagan—or kola,
Then write me down, if so disposed, an ass,
And—more—a follower devout of ZOLA.
CANNIBALISM IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 1—It was recently
reported that a certain clergyman had just been "collated" by

is most startling. Will there not be an Ecclesiastical Commission
to rival, if not to surpass, those of many of the Yukon bonanzas.

I had only german Gold, so have i the Reckoning therewith
payed, but i nave something in the Change lost. Lucklywise had
i some german Fiftypfennigebits for the Drinkgolds. The Diener-
schaft seemed not very content, i know not why. But in the
Railstation give i one Fiftypfennigebit to the Packagecarrier,
and he say, No, Maunsiah, not gud." Warum sagen sie atte,
"Maunsiah"? See i as one Frencher out? TJnpossibly! It
are Frenchers who siemly fat are, but they are so short. I am
not thin, but i am high as the most Prussiers. I inhabited one.
time in Miinchen, so drink i Bier yet willinger as the Berliners,
and man say that the Miincheners so fat are, because they so
mutsch Bier drink.
Also say i to the Packagecarrier, " It is queit gud, it is german

not," anser i, "what wish You? Have You a Tarif." "Yes,"
say he, "Tarif, too bob, too Schillings." Zwei Mark! Ach,
wie teiier! England is yet deerer as Wien. I have in the Hotel
Cash some little Money received, and i give him too Schilling.
Then step i in the Waggon up, and he say, as the Train away go,
"Thanky, Maunsiah." Noch wieder!
What for one little Coupe! The Trains in England are not as
in Prussia. There have we Waegons thro covered Gangways
farther. Now am i in one little Coupe, without Heet, without
Food, inshutted. and hier must i sit remain, because it no
Korndor along the Train is. I have only one Voyagefellow, one
old Lady. She sit next to the Window, who wide opened is.
The Weather is not Kold, but it is unpossibly in the January,
without Heeting, so to voyage. "Beg, gracious Woman," say i,
"permit You to me the Window totomake." And i make it to.
"No, thank You," say she, "i prefer it open." "What," call i,
"You wish tho Window opened in the January, inthismiserabel,
kold, englisch Waggon? It is unpossibly!" "We must have
some Air," say she, but she shut it a little. Hinmel! The old
englisch Ladys ure strong. The fresh Air in the Summer some-
times is sound, gesund; she is very daugerly, gefdhrlich, in the
Winter, in the german Kailwaywaggon kom she never.
Lucklywise am i with mein Voyagecover, too Overcoats, and
one Mantel, called in Germany "Havelock," covered, and like-
wise kan I smoke because the Coupe not Nicht-Raucher inscribed
is. I kindle mein Cigar at. "Oh 1" call the old Lady,
"'Smoking is not allowed." "Beg," i anser, "this Coupe is not
Not^Smoker." "This is not a Smokingcarridge," say she.
"Forgive," say i, a little angry, "this is not Not Smoking. So
kau i smoke. You shud not hierin kom." Meenweil the Train
thro several Tunnels, where the Air yet colder is, go, and then
halt he. "Garde!" call the old Lady. Was ist das? Ach, der
Schaffner! The old Lady spiek, he spiek, i spiek. We are all
angry. Endly understand i that in England man only in the
Coupe, as in France "Fumeurs" inscribed, smoke. "I go also
in one other Waggon," say i. "No Time," say the Garde, the
Train go, and there must i the whole Voyage with the old Lady,
and the fresh Air, and without Cigars, remain. Donnerwetter!
At the next Railstation dare i not outtostep, because the stop-
ping so short is. One half Hour later become the Heaven quiet
dark. It is too Clock. Wie sonderbar! The Train halt. No
Railstation. I am hungry. If i only in Prussia were, now would

WE learn that the above advertisement, which appeared last
week in the columns of a leading morning paper, has been

undertaking has been placed on a sound commercial basis, and
a prospectus, from which we extract the following particulars,
issued: —
The List will Open To-morrow, Thursday, Jan. 20, 1898, and
will Close on or before Friday, Jan. 30, 1899, for Town and

PROSPECTUS.
1. This Company is formed to acquire the well-kuowu aiid old-
established business oi Air. UOLLINUS, Crossing-sweeper, ot Upper
Brook Street, u., and tbat ot .Ur. HILL MUUUINH, i'lotessioual
Cab-tollower, ot Loudou-witum-ihe-Kadius.
2. It is proposed to ettect an amalgamation of the above-
mentioned niguly remunerative and prosperous concerns, under
a scheme ot imancial unification, ttie respective working stalls
and plant remaining distinct, as heretofore.
3. The question of "perks," over and above legitimate earn-
ings, to bo settled by private treaty between the V eiidor and
his Patrons.
4. The remarkably prosperous undertaking of the Vendor was
first initiated fourteen years ago, when the goodwill of a sound,
attractive, and welt-organised street-crossing in Mayfair was
taken over for a consideration by the present Vendor, first as a
.'"rum tenens, and subsequently in permanency, all out-standing
claims and liabilities having been settled with the aid of a broom-
suck. From the commencement the annual turnover has been
on a largely increasing scale, owing to the adoption of business-
like methods, and to the masterly inactivity of the Local Vestry,
combined with a judicious nictitation of the eye of the adjacent
policeman for the time being. The weather has been almost
consistently muddy and favourable for a steady high average of
takings, and there is every prospect that this desirable state of
affairs will continue. Among the Vendor's Patrons are numbered
some of the most exquisitely-shod wearers of patent-leather
among the British aristocracy, and not a few short-sighted .and
timorous old ladies of a thoroughly reliable and benevolent
character.
5. The contemplated Cab-Running branch of the joint under-
taking is a later development, but is already productive of a
splendid dividend, the initial outlay being extremely small. Mr.
MUGGINS has attended to his customers on a scientific and im-
partial system, and it is felt that the time has arrived to invite
the Public at large to co-operate cordially in the exploitation of
his eloquent and unrivalled methods in the pursuit of travelling-
trunks and the cajolement of their owners.
6. It will be readily recognised that the proposed venture is
totally distinct from speculative schemes of the " wild-cat " order,
and it is therefore scarcely necessary or advisable to present an
estimate of the expenses (which are merely nominal, consisting in
the purchase of one broom), and of the profits, which are likely

THE accused had left the Court ac-
quitted, lie had certainly said some harsh
things about the people who now applauded
him. He had also passed through the
ordeal of an inquiry into his personal his-
tory with some anxiety. But he was ac-
quitted. Yes, acquitted. So the people
cheered him to the echo. He was tired of
bowing his acknowledgments. He was
weary of hand-shakes. He was of course
gratified, but it was embarrassing. It was
not that he had won some magnificent vic-
tory over the would-be invaders of his
country. It was not that he had made a
discovery that had startled the wondering
world by its novelty. It was not that he
had written a book of such magnificent
proportions that MOLIERE had to withdraw
ana SHAKSPEAHK take a back seat. No, the
ovation was awarded for none of these
feats. It had been merited by an act of far
greater importance.
So the cheers were repeated again and
again. The columns or laudation were
priuted and reprinted and reprinted.

played. It was a grand day for the

The accused had left the Court ac-
quitted.
There were a few articles in the papers
pointing out that the matter was fairly
satisfactory. And he himself was pleased
to learn that he might claim to have left
the Tribunal without a stain on his charac-
ter. And a very intimate friend dropped
him a line offering him luke-warm con-
gratulations and a suggestion that he should
be more careful in the future.
A foreigner asked what it was about.
"Scarcely know," replied a casual ac-
quaintance; "but that some one has been
proved to be innocent."
And then the accused retired into private
life. And that is the way they have in

ON reading this statement, Mr. Punch,
with his usual promptness, at once des-
patched his own Prophetic Interviewer to
call upon the Superintendent of the Home,
and has received the following report: —
The Home is a pleasant building, stand-
ing in its own grounds, which are sur-
rounded by a high wooden paling completely
covered by advertisements. These set forth
the merits of certain works written by the
inmates. "Try my Syrupy Sonnets \" read

the Superintendent, who courteously gave
me every information.
"Yes," he said, in answer to my ques-

we have had to refuse a large number of
applicants. Impostors? No; we are
generally able to detect them. We did
find, indeed, that the only work of fiction

admittance was a forged bank-note, and
that another's claim to be relieved as a
distressed poet rested on the fact of his
having written two stanzas in praise of a
patent medicine. But almost all the cases
are genuine."
"And do they get on amicably with one
another?" I enquired.
"There is some friction at times," he
admitted. "This morning, for instance, I

excitedly.

"Generally they talk so much as they run

kailyard stories, but they went suddenly

I thanked him for his information, and
prepared to take my departure. As we
passed through the house again, I noticed
a curious-looking penny-in-the-slot machine

"Put in a penny, and you '11 see," said

piece of green paper, on which was pasted
what looked like, a newspaper-extract.
"By this book," it read, "the literature

ON reading this statement, Mr. Punch,
with his usual promptness, at once des-
patched his own Prophetic Interviewer to
call upon the Superintendent of the Home,
and has received the following report: —
The Home is a pleasant building, stand-
ing in its own grounds, which are sur-
rounded by a high wooden paling completely
covered by advertisements. These set forth
the merits of certain works written by the
inmates. "Try my Syrupy Sonnets I" read
one poster; while next to it was the an-
nouncement, "My historical novel defies
competition. Read Blood and Thunder,
and you will be happy. Six murders, four
suicides and three daring escapes for 4s. 6d.
net I" Passing into the building, I found
the Superintendent, who courteously gave
me every information.
"Yes," he said, in answer to my ques-
tions, " our establishment is quite full, and
we have had to refuse a large number of
applicants. Impostors? No; we are
generally able to detect them. We did
nnd, indeed, that the only work of fiction
written by one of those who had gained
admittance was a forged bank-note, and
that another's claim to be relieved as a
distressed poet rested on the fact of his
having written two stanzas in praise of a
patent medicine. But almost all the cases
are genuine."
"And do they get on amicably with one
another P" I enquired.
"There is some friction at times," he
admitted. "This morning, for instance, I

bis watch.

"I 'm not a critic, my dear Sir," I said,
soothingly, trying to disengage his hand

"Oh, but you have influence!" he
eaded. "If you only know the wife

"Why should she throw mud?" I asked,

Saturday.— Hounds met about four
miles away. Boys and I started in good
time. Overtook my biggest subscriber, Sir
JOSEPH BLOWFIELD. Introduced nephews
and BOOTS. Little wretches ducked their
heads by way of greeting, and drop behind
us and giggle persistently. Sir JOSEPH
turns in his saddle unexpectedly, and
catches TOMMY grimacing at him, to huge
joy of other two boys. Sir J. rides off
furious. Shall probably lose his subscrip-
tion now. Lent MAX my hunting-crop,
which he wildly tried to crack. Thong
catches TOMMY'S ear. Lets go a howl like
hyaena. Intervene to avoid row between
them. Arrive meet. Kennel up hounds
in coach-house near. Deer-cart irresistible
attraction to TOMMY and BOOTS. MAX now
missing. Am about to order deer to be
enlarged, when with terrific " tow-yowing"
Gallop off to see who could have
let them out, blowing horn frantically.
Thought hounds would be in half-dozen
parishes before they sobered down again.
On enquiry, found that MAX was culprit.
So anxious to look at hounds, that he must
needs open door and peep in. Of course,
they all bolted out, knocking MAX flat on
his back, and charging right over him.
MAX an awful sight, and covered with mud.
Shut hounds up again, and return to deer-
cart. Enlarge. Fifteen minutes' law, and
then lay on pack. TOMMY scuttles down to
only jumpable place in first fence, where
pony refuses. Tries again, keeping whole
field waiting. Pony sticks fast half-way
through fence. All the people kept behind
using fearful language. Man rides against
pony's hind-quarters, and knocks him clean

LOVER of children I Fellow-heir with those
Of whom the imperishable kingdom is!
Beyond all dreaming now your spirit knows
The unimagined mysteries.
Darkly as in a glass our faces look
To read ourselves, if so we may, aright;
You, like the maiden in your faene book —
You step beyond and see the light I
The heart you wore beneath your pedant's
cloak
Only to children's hearts you gave away;
Yet unaware in half the world you woke
The slumbering charm of childhood's day.
We older children, too, our loss lament,
We of the "Table Round," remembering
well
How he, our comrade, with his pencil lent
Your fancy's speech a firmer spell.
Master of rare woodcraft, by sympathy's
Sure touch he caught your visionary
gleams,
And made your fame, the dreamer's, one
with his,
The wise interpreter of dreams.
Farewell! But near our hearts we havt
you yet,
Holding our heritage with loving hand,
Who may not follow where your feet are set
Upon the ways of WTonderl;md.

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
No. VIII.—To MR. EUDYARD KIPLING.
MT DEAR SIB,—Not very many years ago (I fail to remember
the exact number) there was published in our beloved and
friendly Spectator a review, eulogistic to the point of enthusiasm,
of a little volume of soldier-stories which had lately seen the
light of publication at, I think, Allahabad. In this review we
were called upon to take note that a new literary force had
manifested itself. Here, said the Spectator critic, is something
absolutely fresh, direct and powerful, a series of tales in which
the author goes straight to his point, grips the root of the matter
with an unerring hand, and keeps his characters true to life
throughout. He had, so the Spectator assured us, insight and
uncommon dramatic power. What more could be desired? The
jaded student of the literature of the day read this review in his
usual otiose fashion. Had he not heard time and again similar
announcements, discoveries of bright particular suns that were
to shed a new brilliance and warmth on the dark arid places of
the earth? And, lo, with a feeble twinkling they had risen and
flickered back into the dismal gloom from which they had so
lately emerged. This knowledge made us sceptical, and thus,
when we read the article I have referred to, we shrugged our
shoulders, smiled incredulously, and forgot—forgot everything,
except the quaint, jagged, burlesque name of the Spectator's new-
found author. Yet soon the Spectator was justified of its dis-
covery. Throbbing and booming from India's coral strand the
new force began to make itself felt, until with a rush and a roar
the clouds burst, the thunder clattered, the daily and the weekly
papers took up the reverberating echoes, and the products of
RUDYARD KIPLING'S pen fell, thick as leaves in Vallombrosa, into
the libraries and the railway book-stalls.
Men, wise men and critics, may sometimes be heard to marvel
at the surprising welcome that was extended to you. Why, they
isk, should this man have leapt at once into fame whilst others,
remote bye-paths? I think I know one reason at least. You
came at one of those recurrent periods when great impulses have
spent themselves, and some men, noting that all their famous
ones have died or faded, begin to think that the last word in
literature has been said. It is related of JOHN STUART MILL that
—I was about to say, when he was young, but MILL was never
young as other men are young—it is related of him that, at a
comparatively early period of his old age, he was seriously per-
turbed as to the future of music. His mathematical mind sug-
gested to him that, as there was only a certain fixed number of
mitt's, it was demonstrable that these were capable of only a
certain fixed number of permutations and combinations, and
that therefore, within a period of time strictly limited, all
possible tunes and variations would be exhausted, and the world
would be left with no music but the stale airs of past generations.
Ordinary mortals do not much trouble their heads with these
speculations; we have rubbed along comfortably enough in the
meantime with WAGNER, GOUNOD. VEKDI, BRAHMS, TCHAIKOVSKI
and others, and even the boy in the street now and then yells or
whistles some fresh and original song of the music-halls. So,
too, Lord KELVIN tells us that a fearful danger threatens crea-
tion, since, at our present rate of breathing, a few paltry hun-
dreds of thousands of years will see all the oxygen in the air
exhausted, while the shores of creation will be strewn with the
corpses of those who will have died literally for want of breath.
But in the meantime we breathe on and live unperturbed by
these remote catastrophes. We waste no sorrow on them, unlike
in this respect to the mastodons, of whom, as you may remember,
Mrs. BROWNING wrote (I quote from memory):—
"It did not much
Console the race of mastodons to know
Their place would quicken with the elephant.
They were not elephants, but mastodons."
Yet, although most of us who were neither wise men nor critics
did not speculate seriously upon the death or even upon the
Inn equals if not his superiors in art, lingered on obscurely in the
dearth of literature, we could not, at the time of which I speak,

but be affected to a certain extent by the dismal forebodings of
those who said they kne\y. DICKBNH and THACKERAY were dead,
TENNYSON and BROWNING had done their work. \Vho was left?
So the grey-beards shook their heads, and warned us to begin to
read philosophy and prepare for our latter ends. And suddenly,
trumpets Sounding a'nd drums beating and swords flashing, in
marches RUDYARD KIPLING at the head of his scarlet-coated
retinue, bringing with him the gunpowder-smoke and all the
great barbarous primitive instincts ol man delighting in battle.
In a moment the face of things was changed. Now we knew that
hitherto our lives had been blanks for want of British soldiers,
and Indian battle-stories, and barracks, and mess-rooms, and
cantonments, and swarthy cruel natives with snaky hair and
murderous knives, and regimental traditions. Pale, pigeon-
breasted young men began to breathe fire, and refused to sleep
o^ nights unless they had swathed their dauntless bodies in a
Union Jack, and surrounded their camp-bedsteads with a
chevaux-de-frise of bayonets. How patriotic we were all going to
be, and with what a scathing contempt did we intend for the
future to look down upon Bengalees, and legislators, and com-
merce, and the puny, sickly people who lived in streets (we
ourselves were mostly constrained not altogether unwillingly to
live in streets, but what of that?), and how gallantly we all
proposed to carry the name and fame of England into the remote
parts of the earth over the shapeless, trampled bodies of myriads
of foemen. Even Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN caught a belated little
flame, and implored us, in the columns of the Tirnes and at the
Alhambra Music-hall, to hurry up, Jiurry up for pity to the help
of Johannesburg. That phase has now passed , we have begun
to realise that froth will not float our fleets, that blunter will not
bring victory to our armies, and that quiet men who refuse to
rave and spout have their use in the world; but something of
solid advantage does, I think, remain to us in a quickened sense
of the greatness of our motherland, and in a new sympathy for
those who fight her battles. For that I believe you, Sir, art
more nearly responsible even than Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. It matters
not that you, the Tyrtaeus of this warlike movement, should have
had to confess that when assaulted by a raging relative you
preferred to invoke the protection of the law before a humdrum
justice of the peace, rather than to act according to the gospel ol
LXABOYU. MOLVANEY and ORTHERIS. Men, when they read of
this incident, smiled without malice, and realised that after all
there was nothing else to be done under the circumstances.
Well, Sir, you have done great things on paper (I use the word
without a hint of offence), and great things remain for you to do.
You speak to us with a brutal directness, and we are forced to
listen. In your stories there is no beating about the bush.
What you want, to say you know, and your meaning starts out
clear, sharp and distinct before the eyes of the dullest of your
readers. Those who have fed on the strong and generous fare
you have furnished to them have no stomach afterwards for the
sickly kickshaws of the analysts or the decadents. You help us

No. VIII.—To MR. RUDYARD KIPLINO.
Mr DEAR SIB,—Not very many years ago (I fail to remember
the exact number) there was published in our beloved and
friendly Spectator a review, eulogistic to the point of enthusiasm,
of a little volume of soldier-stories which had lately seen the
light of publication at, I think, Allahabad. In this review we
were called upon to take note that a new literary force had
manifested itself. Here, said the Spectator critic, is something
absolutely fresh, direct and powerful, a series of tales in which
the author goes straight to his point, grips the root of the matter
with an unerring hand, and keeps his characters true to life
throughout. lie had, so the Spectator assured us, insight and
uncommon dramatic power. What more could be desired? The
jaded student of the literature of the day read this review in his
usual otiose fashion. Had he not heard time and again similar
announcements, discoveries of bright particular suns that were
to shed a new brilliance and warmth on the dark arid places of
the earth? And, lo, with a feeble twinkling they had risen and
flickered back into the dismal gloom from which they had so
lately emerged. This knowledge made us sceptical, and thus,
when we read the article I have referred to, we shrugged our
shoulders, smiled incredulously, and forgot—forgot everything,
except the quaint, jagged, burlesque name of the Spectator'! new-
found author. Yet soon the Spectator was justified of its dis-
covery. Throbbing and booming from India's coral strand the
new force began to make itself felt, until with a rush and a roar
the clouds burst, the thunder clattered, the daily and the weekly
papers took up the reverberating echoes, and the products of
RUDYABD KIPLING'S pen fell, thick as leaves in Vallombrosa, into
the libraries and the railway book-stalls.
Men, wise men and critics, may sometimes be heard to marvel
at the surprising welcome that was extended to you. Why, they
Hsk, should this man have leapt at once into fame whilst others,
remote bye-paths? I think I know one reason at least. You
came at one of those recurrent periods when great impulses have
spent themselves, and some men, noting that all their famous
ones have died or faded, begin to think that the last word in
literature has been said. It is related of JOHN STUART MILL that
—I was about to say, when he was young, but MILL was never
young as other men are young—it is related of him that, at a
comparatively early period of his old age, he was seriously per-
turbed as to the future of music. His mathematical mind sug-
gested to him that, as there was only a certain fixed number of
notes, it was demonstrable that these were capable of only a
certain fixed number of permutations and combinations, and
that therefore, within a period of time strictly limited, all
possible tunes and variations would be exhausted, and the world
would be left with no music but the stale airs of past generations.
Ordinary mortals do not much trouble their heads with these
speculations; we have rubbed along comfortably enough in the
meantime with WAGNER, GOUNOD, V ERDI, BRAHMS, TCHAIKOVBKI
and others, and even the boy in the street now and then yells or
whistles some fresh and original song of the music-halls. So,
too, Lord KELVIN tells us that a fearful danger threatens crea-
tion, since, at our present rate of breathing, a few paltry hun-
dreds of thousands of years will see all the oxygen in the air
exhausted, while the shores of creation will be strewn with the
corpses of those who will have died literally for want of breath.
But in the meantime we breathe on and live unperturbed by
these remote catastrophes. We waste no sorrow on them, unlike
in this respect to the mastodons, of whom, as you may remember,
Mrs. BROWNING wrote (I quote from memory):—
"It did not much
Console the race of mastodons to know
Their place would quicken with the elephant.
They were not elephants, but mastodons."
Yet, although most of us who were neither wise men nor critics
did not speculate seriously upon the death or even upon the
his equals if not his superiors m art, lingered on obscurely in the
dearth of literature, we could not, at the time of which I speak,

So the grey-beards shook their heads, and warned us to begin to
read philosophy and prepare for our latter ends. And suddenly,
trumpets Sounding 'and drums beating and swords flashing, in
marches RUDYARD KIPLING at the head of his scarlet-coated
retinue, bringing with him the gunpowder-smoke and all the
great barbarous primitive instincts of man delighting in battle.
In a moment the face of things was changed. Now we knew that
hitherto our lives had been Blanks for want of British soldiers,
and Indian battle-stories, and barracks, and mess-rooms, and
cantonments, and swarthy cruel natives with snaky hair and
murderous knives, and regimental traditions. Pale, pigeon-
breasted young men began to breathe fire, and refused to sleep
o' nights unless they had swathed their dauntless bodies in a
Union Jack, and surrounded their camp-bedsteads with a
chevaux-de-frise of bayonets. How patriotic we were all going to
be, and with what a scathing contempt did we intend for the
future to look down upon Bengalees, and legislators, and com-
merce, and the puny, sickly people who lived in streets (we
ourselves were mostly constrained not altogether unwillingly to
live in streets, but what of that?), and how gallantly we all
proposed to carry the name and fame of England into the remote
parts of the earth over the shapeless, trampled bodies of myriads
of foemen. Even Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN caught a belated little
flame, and implored us, in the columns of the Timei and at the
Alhambra Music-hall, to hurry up, hurry up for pity to the help
of Johannesburg. That phase has now passed; we have begun
to realise that froth will not float our fleets, that bluster will not
bring victory to our armies, and that quiet men who refuse to
rave and spout have their use in the world; but something of
solid advuntuge does, I think, remain to us in a quickened sense
of the greatness of our motherland, and in a new sympathy for
those who fight her battles. For that I believe you, Sir, art
more nearly responsible even than Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. It matters
not that you, the Tyrtteus of this warlike movement, should have
had to confess that when assaulted by a raging relative you
preferred to invoke the protection of the law before a humdrum
justice of the peace, rather than to act according to the gospel of
i.KAuiiYu, MULVANEY and ORTHERIS. Men, when they read of
this incident, smiled without malice, and realised that after all
there was nothing else to be done under the circumstances.
Well, Sir, you have done great things on paper (1 use the word
without a hint of offence), and great things remain for you to do.
You speak to us with a brutal directness, and we are forced to
listen. In your stories there is no beating about the bush.
What you want to .say you know, and your meaning starts out
clear, sharp and distinct before the eyes of the dullest of your
readers. Those u ho have fed on the strong and generous fare

to the Artistic World. The gratifying suc-

petition. Our object, to be quite frank, is
to cut them out. High work at low

embodying the distinctive motifs of various
types of song; though, as a fact, the
regular verses, not here published, are in
merit. Along with the samples we offer
one or two hints as to the class of per-
former best adapted for their interpreta-
tion. Its price is also assigned to each
article.
SAMPLE I.—THE PATRIOTIC NATIONAL.
(10s. 6d.)
This is suitable for a full-bodied basso.
It can be sung during periods of foreign
complication. Also when there are Ju-
bilees going on; or Naval Reviews. Note
the quiet humour underlying this frag-
ment.
Then Hurrah I and again Hurrah I
For the glorious British Tar!
For Jack at the helm
On our Ocean realm,
Or drunk at the harbour-bar I
And it's likewise three times three
For the Ships of the QTJBBN'S Navee t
For they '11 go anywhere,
And they 're always there,
And that's where they ought to be!
SAMPLE II.—THE TOPO-POLITICAL.
(Ss. Oid.)
To be delivered in a statesmanlike man-
ner. The artiste should withdraw early iu
this kind of song if he finds himself out of
harmony with the major portion of his
audience.
While the KAISER 's a-blowin' his trumpet,
And Russia 's a-lickin' her chops,
There 's a party would like us to lump it,
And swallow humility slops;
But BEBESFORD—gosh! he 's a nipper,
He '11 York "em, you bet, an' no kid;
He 's the right little, tight little, skipper
To scuttle their binnacle-lid!
SAMPLE III.—THE POPULAB
SENTIMENTAL. (4s. lOd.)
A fine effect of contrast is produced if
this song is put into the mouth of a well-
known humorist. But your audience must
be intelligent. Otherwise it might miss the
true intention of this little gem. The
success of the words must be judged by
their power to touch the heart. One
pockethandkerchief in ten (free passes ex-
cluded) is a fair proportion.
Little DISY I pure young thing I
'Ave they bin an' took yer, dorlin' P
Where the blessed ingels sing
Carnt I "ear yer voice a-callin'?
Just abart the dorn o' dy,
Might 'a' bin a shide past seven,
Little DISY fled awy
Like a narrer strite to 'Eaven!
SAMPLE IV.—THE PATHO-ROMANTIO.
(Is. Hid.)
This is suitable for artistes not specially
gifted with humour. The tenor that takes
it should be able to command a tremolo;
but he doesn't need to know anything of
clog-dancing. It might be given early in
the evening before the stalls arrive; or
later on if the bar wants patronising.
Come, then, and let us part, love I
Adown the aching years

Knowledge at the St. James's, Mr. GEORGE
ALEXANDER writes to say, that by the
time it is withdrawn, "it will have run a
hundred and thirty nights," and will have
brought to the management and the author
"a large profit." Delighted! If we pos-
sessed such a tree, we should let it go on
growing and producing still more fruit.

, just issued from BLAPKWOOD'S Press, Mr. BLACK
MORE calls "A Romance of Surrey." The scene opens in Surrey
and there dwells awhile, providing opportunity for some of thow
sketches of country folk and country scenes which the authoi
knows so well how to present. Towards the end the readei
is transported to the frosty Caucasus, which probably Mr
BLACKMORB never left his market-garden to gaze upon, bui
which he makes delightfully clear in its nagged grandeur. H*
tries a new flight by making his story chiefly revolve round i
group of Caucasians, most of whom are exceedingly tall and o<
surpassing beauty, whilst some are phenomenally wicked. The
narrative of the pursuit of the wicked Queen Marva, and thi
fight which rescues her brother from her feline grasp, is told ii
a manner worthy of the historian of Lorna Doone. But on th«
whole my Baronite is not warmly drawn towards the Caucasians

charming little volume, On a Sunshine Holiday, retains his per
name, The Amateur Angler. But the veil of anonymity is ex-
ceedingly thin, and only the modesty inherent in a publishei
counsels its retention. My Baronite frankly confesses that there
is here no opening for paying off imagined scores by scathing
criticism. Mr. MARSTON not only convoys the reader into pleasant
pathways by field and river, but discourses of things by the way.

fashion. Nothing is pleasanter in the book (of course published
by SAMPSON Low; no others need apply to E. MARSTON) than
the dedication to "My dear DOROTHY," which in its delicate
humour has the flavour of the elder essayists.
Mr. OSCAR BROWNING appropriately brings out his life of
Peter the Great (HUTCHTNSON) at a time when Sir HENRY IRVING
at the Lyceum has stirred afresh human interest in that marvel-
lous man. O. B., with the judicial manner, not to say the
frigidity, of a college Don. is by no means carried away by
PETER'S grandly-mad career. Some people would say the
style of treatment is a little woodeny. But the theme is so
stupendous that no collegiate coldness can prevent it from
bubbling up even in these severely-placid pages. There are
several interesting portraits and some sound information in the
work. It also suggests to my Baronite how much the world has

HEARTS AND HOLMES AT THE GLOBE.
Poymary at the Criterion showed how an elderly gentle*nan
fell in love with his youthful ward, and made the mistake of
thinking that this young girl liad fallen in love with him. He was
soon desiltusinnne by the object of his affection coming to him for
his consent to her marriage with a good youth of her own age.
In A Bachelor'* Romance, an elderly man, a kindly literary
recluse, falls in love with his ward, and she with him, proving the
genuineness of her sentiment by refusing to marry a young man
of "her time o' life." It is a pretty comedy, which Miss MARTHA
MORTON might have told to greater advantage in three acts instead
of four. The fourth act, however, has in it more movement than
the preceding three, and the final scene, very happily contrived,
brings down the curtain on a thoroughly satisfactory climax.
In Doric/ Holmex, Mr. JOHN HARE has one of those delightful
middle-aged parts in which he is "just perfect." His geniality,
his soft-heartedness, his uprightness, his quick-temper, and his
readiness for self-sacrifice, endear David Holmes to the spectator,
and gain for him the entire audience as his personal friends.
Mr. GILBERT HARE'S make-up and performance of the old
clerk, a kind of Tom Pinch, is most artistic. The authoress ought
to have made more of this character, a remark, by the way, that
applies to everyone throughout the play. All the characters are
too sketchy. In only one thing do I venture to doubt the judg-
ment of Mr. GILBERT HARE and the authoress, either or both,
and that is, in the third act, where the joviality of Dai-id Holmes
sets heavy JJ/V. Mulberry (well-represented by Mr. JAMES LEIGH)
and over-boisterous young Mr. Salvage (Mr. FRANK GILLMORE)
singing and dancing, in which they are ultimately joined by
feeble old broken-down Martin Beggs. Far more effective would
his bye-play be were he dumbfounded at witnessing this exhi-
bition of forced boyishness (as one who was seeing something
strange in a vision, and realising it as a fact), and were he
to be utterly overcome by the self-consciousness of his own
inability to share in this exuberance of animal spirits. How-
ever, as it is, the song and dance of the quartette "goes" im-
mensely, as surprises, brought in naturally, will always do on the
stage. Mr. FREDERICK KERR'S pourtrayal of a Ne'er-do-well-till-
he-does-better sort of man is excellent; and Miss MAY HARVEY,
Miss ORAM, Miss SuSiB VAUGHAN, are all "as good as they make
"em." Miss NELLIE THORNE, as Sylvia, is a charming ingenue,
possible "young person," until the last act, when she suddenly
develops into a sensible young woman, who not only knows her
own mind, but gives two or three of them a bit of it. Altogether
a very pretty, if not a very strong, play; memorable for the
finished performance of Mr. GILBERT HARE, and of Mr. JOHN
HARE as David Holmes, "Holmes, Sweet Holmes!"
AN APPEAL TO CAESAR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I see that Mr. BEERBOHM TREE has been
writing a lot about JULIUS C-ESAR—how he comes to think ot
such clever things I 'm sure I can't tell-—on the occasion of the
Shakspearian revival at Her Majesty's. Well, of course, it's
awfully good and learned of him. But I really wish he wouldn't.
I hate having my fixed ideas shaken, and my fixed idea about old
JULIUS is, that he came to England B.C. 55 to eat oysters and to
write a book to worry the lives out of the lower school.
Yours sincerely, SMITH MINOR.

bition of forced boyishness (as one who was seeing something

ever, as it is, the song and dance of the quartette "goes" im-
mensely, as surprises, brought in naturally, will always do on the

Miss ORAM, Miss SUSIE VAUGHAN, are all "as good as they make

possible "young person," until the last act, when she suddenly
develops into a sensible young woman, who not only knows her
own mind, but gives two or three of them a bit of it. Altogether
a very pretty, if not a very strong, play; memorable for the
finished performance of Mr. GILBERT HARE, and of Mr. JOHN
HARE as David Holmes, "Holmes, Sweet Holmes 1"
AN APPEAL TO CAESAR.
DEAR MR. PTJNCH,—I see that Mr. BEERBOHM TREE has been
writing a lot about JULIUS C.S8AR—1how he comes to think ot
such clever things I 'm sure I can't tell—on the occasion of the
Shakspearian revival at Her Majesty's. Well, of course, it's
awfully good and learned of him. But I really wish he wouldn't.
I hate having my fixed ideas shaken, and my fixed idea about old
JULIUS is, that he came to England B.C. 55 to eat oysters and to
write a book to worry the lives out of the lower school.
Yours sincerely, SMITH MINOR.

GOING WITH THE TIMES.—Every Englishman is becoming accus-
tomed to see the "u" treated as superfluous in many words.
The American system is to rid the English vocabulary of super-
fluities. But it is, we fancy, quite a novelty to see "parsi-
monious" spelt, as it was in a leader and in a law report in the
Times, "parcimonious." Undoubtedly its Latin derivative hath
it with a "c"; but according to NUTTALL, CICERO (Kikero or
Sisero ?) speljs the substantive " parsimonia." Which is it to be?
Shall we write "susumber" or "kukumber"P If "c" before
"i" is to be hard, then "city" becomes "kity." Well, we are
nearing the end of the kentury, and so let every kivilian spel as
best pleseth him. "The old order changeth, giving plase to new."

NOTHING could be finer than the scenery,

And now for the acting. Mr. THREE-

praise would be the due, no doubt, of
the charming exponent of Ophelia. But
neither the Printe of Denmark nor his

believed that they were both shouting in

gigantic bonnets.
So I bring my notice to a conclusion,
with the hope that some day female head-

the critic will see his Shakspeare once

HEARTS AND HOLMES AT THE GLOBE.
Rnsfmary at the Criterion showed how an elderly gentletnan
fell in love with his youthful ward, and made the mistake of
thinking that this young girl had fallen in love with him. He was
soon desilluxionne by the object of his affection coming to him for
bis consent to her marriage with a good youth of her own age.
In A Rafhelnr's Romance, an elderly man, a kindly literary
recluse, falls in love with his ward, and she with him, proving the
genuineness of her sentiment by refusing to marry a young man
of "her time o" life." It is a pretty comedy, which Miss MARTHA
MORTON might have told to greater advantage in three acts instead
of four. The fourth act, however, has in it more movement than
the preceding three, and the final scene, very happily contrived,
brings down the curtain on a thoroughly satisfactory climax.
In T)arid Holmes, Mr. JOHN HARE has one of those delightful
middle-aged parts in which he is "just perfect." His geniality,
his soft-neartedness, his uprightness, his quick-temper, and his
readiness for self-sacrifice, endear David Holmes to the spectator,
and gain for him the entire audience as his personal friends.
Mr. GILBERT HARE'S make-up and performance of the old
clerk, a kind of Tom Pinch, is most artistic. The authoress ought
to have made more of this character, a remark, by the way, that
applies to everyone throughout the play. AH the characters are
too sketchy. In only one thing do I venture to doubt the judg-
ment of Mr. GILBERT HARE and the authoress, either or both,
and that is, in the third act, where the joviality of Darid Holmes
sets heavy Jfr. Mulberry (well-represented by Mr. JAMES LEIGH)
and over-boisterous young Mr. Savage (Mr. FRANK GII.LMORE)
singing and dancing, in which they are ultimately joined by
feeble old broken-down Martin Jieggx. Far more effective would
his bye-play be were he dumbfounded at witnessing this exhi-
bition or forced boyishness (as one who was seeing something
strange in a vision, and realising it as a fact), and were he

DELINQUENT DONS.
[" A Professor at a Scotch University has been
deprived of his office by the governing body, in
consequence of a petition presented by the students,
asserting that his lectures were ' detective and un-
methodical.' "—Daily Paper.]
CONSIDERABLE interest was aroused in
Cambridge on Thursday last by the trial,
before the Senate, of Professor DRYASDUST,
a university lecturer on history. The gal-
leries of the Senate-house were filled with
undergraduates, while several ladies from
Girton and Newnham were accommodated
with -rats on the Vice-Chancellor's dais.
The charge against the Professor was, in
effect, that he was incompetent to fulfil his
office.
Mr. PRIGSBY, an undergraduate of
King's, was the first witness. In his
opinion, the Professor's lectures were de-
fective—were, in fact, quite worthless. It
was at his instigation that the prosecution
had been begun. Previously he had at-
tempted to improve the lectures by setting
the Professor right when he went astray,
but these efforts had not been successful.
On the contrary, the Professor had told
him to hold his tongue, at which, naturally,
he felt hurt. A lecturer unwilling to be
interrupted by his pupils was, in the wit-
ness's opinion, clearly incompetent. In
cross-exnmination, Mr. PRIOSBY acknow-
ledged that he had only passed hie " little-
go," at the fourth attempt, a week before
he sought to instruct Professor DRYASDUST.
Mr. LACKINGTIN, a Fellow of Trinity,
was the next to give evidence. He fully
shared the opinion of the last witness that
the Professor's lectures were unsatisfac-
tory. He had not, of course, attended
them himself, but had heard about them
from undergraduates. In case the Pro-
fessorship were declared vacant, the wit-
ness expressed his willingness to undertake
its duties himself at a moderate stipend.
Cross-examined, he stated that he had not
been on speaking-terms with the Professor
for some time, but denied that any per-
sonal feeling influenced his evidence. But,
in justice to himself, he felt bound to point
out that his own claims to the Professor-
ship
At this point the Court invited Mr.
I.AC KIM. UN to stand down.
Mr. BLADE, of Magdalene, was next
called. He stated that he considered the
Professor's lectures silly drivel. His own
experience showed that they were useless,
for he had been clean ploughed in the
history tripos, although he had worked for
several hours on the night before his exa-
mination. Pressed as to the number of
times he had attended the lectures, witness
said that he had been twice at least. He
might have played "noughts and crosses"
the whole time he was in the lecture-room.
He could not say that the Professor's lec-
tures were worse than others, as he had
not attended any others. He considered
all lectures "rot."
The next witness was Mr. SOCLSBY, ot
Pembroke. He considered that Professor
DRYASDUST should be ejected from office
immediately. His lectures were crude and
prosaic to a degree, being chiefly made up
of sordid facts and dates. There was a
total lack of poetry in them, and no sign
of the Higher yEstheticism. The Professor
had shown no appreciation of witness's
Ballade of Monarchal Amours, which
proved his utter want of the true critical
faculty.

T f Old Farmer Jones (who has been to a local cattle-show, and seen a horseless carriage for the first
time). "MOSHBR CAKSU MAY BE ALL VERY WELL—(hie!)—BVT THEY CAN'T FIND 'KR WAY
HOME BY 'EMSHELVES!"
SIMPKINS, of Girton, then entered the
witness-box. She declared that she had
been compelled to attend lectures given
by the Professor, whom she detested.
Asked as to her reason, she explained that
he wore a shabby coat and a hideous tie.
(Applause from the gallery, which was at
once suppressed.)
The next witness, Mr. CHUNDRA DAB-
JOREB, of Christ's College, had begun to
explain that lectures on history which neg-
lected to deal fully with India were an
insult to his nation, when Professor DRY-
ASDUST interrupted, and begged leave to
make a statement. He said that the pro-
ceedings need not be protracted further,
as he had quite decided to resign liis office.
Before doing so, however, he wished to
give his candid opinion about the Court,
which was that of all
ing that he could not hear the witness on
this point, and the proceedings then came
somewhat hurriedly to an enu.
EXAMPLE OF ENGLISH PRACTICE IN THE
FRENCH CHAMBER.— Count BADBNI, the
Austrian ex-Premier, could not obtain ad-
mission during the fracas in the Chamber
of Deputies. His ex-Excellency, if the
Count as a Premier ever were an Excel-
lency, had to leave. This is clearly a
following of our English Parliamentary
procedure (adapted to the occasion), and
known here as " a Count out."

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
CESSATION of publication of the valuable work, Annals of Our
Time, leaves a grievous gap. Mr. EDMUND ROUTLEDGE, rushing
in where it has not occurred to others to tread, produces his
Bunk of the Year (GEORGE ROUTLBDGE AND SONS). It purports to
be a chronicle of the times and a record of events. As far as
my Baronite has tested it it misses nothing of importance. Being
produced at a price suited to the pockets of the populace it, or
course, has not the fullness of the text of its more costly aaid
bulky forerunner. But though not so deep as a well or so wide
as a church door, it will serve. Of its literary style the following
entry, under date, Tuesday, May 4th, shews how Mr. ROUTLEDGE,
though not unduly stout in person, can, an' he will, make the
flesh creep: "Sir ELLIS ASHMEAD-BARTLETT, M.P., stopped by a
Greek warship and made prisoner." Not a word too much, you
see, nor any touch lacking in order to bring before the mind's
eye that memorable incident in the world's history.
The excellent re-issue of CHARLES LEVER'S novels (DOWNEY
& Co., Limited) progresses most satisfactorily. Heartily wel-
comed have been our oldest friends, Charles O'Malky, Harry
Lorrequer, Tom Burke,, and The Knight of G-wynne, and most
anxious has the Baron been to make the acquaintance of those
other children of LEVER who have hitherto been to him little
more than names, Sir Jasper Carew for example, illustrated
not by the, to us, familiar hand of HABLOT K. BROWNE, who gave
such a "go" to all LEVER'S early works that each one of them
went off, like a bottle of champagne, with a "Phiz," but by
another BROWNE, yclept GORDON "of that ilk," and well has he
caught the spirit of his author. "Phiz" served under two
CHARLES'S, and was loyal to both DICKENS and LEVER. But the
old illustrators have passed away, giving place to new, and in his
illustrations to Con Cregan, Mr. GORDON BROWNE has just given
that life-like touch to LEVER'S characters which is of their essence,
"Etiez-vous a Sedan?" These were the last words of
NAPOLEON III., addressed to his old friend and faithful com-
panion Dr. CONNEAU. The adventurous life which practically
ended in the death-trap of Sedan, is related by Mr. ARCHIBALD
FORBES. His Life of Napoleon III. (CHATTO AND \VINDUS) add*
to the accuracy of a historical annul the charm of romance. Up
to 1870 he is indebted for his facts to a battalion of authorities
drawn up in imposing line on a prefatory page of the volume.
From these he has compiled a stirring narrative, more especially
forceful in the earlier chapters. After the coup d'Etat the work
drops into the vulgar commonplace of the Empire. With the
first blast of the trumpet of war the pluckiest, most resourceful,
and most successful war correspondent of the century is at his
best again. The story of the campaign which began at Saar-
bruck and ended at Sedan is, my Baronite testifies, a brilliant
piece of writing. It carries the reader breathless to the closing
scene at ChisTehurst, and the infinite pathos of the dying
Emperor's faintly-murmured last words. THE BARON HE B.-W.

TOBY, M.P.'S TOILET NECESSARIES.
IN view of the proximate opening of Parliament, TOBY, M.P.
bus been approached by an influential syndicate with the re- i
quest that he would permit his name to be associates with a
number of toilet necessaries to be dispensed in the hairdresser a
department recently added as a wing to the Palace of \»est-
mmster. It is pointed out to him that a gentleman well-known
in the journalistic world has recently floated a hair-wash on
\\lin-ii he has bestowed his uanie. "He aims to be doing very
well with it, too," said the spokesman of the syndicate. The
following is a rough draft ot Uie circular it is proposed to adver-
tise in the morning papers and circulate with the Votes:
fllOBY, M.P.'s LIQUID HAIR DYE.—This lucious compo-
JL siuon will be found most easy of application. It is merely
necessary to have the head brushed for five minutes with a besom.
Then damp the hair with the dye sprinkled on a floor-cloth. In
twenty-tour hours it will produce an extremely light brown, a
dark yellow, a bright blue, or a vermilion colour according to
taste. M.P.'s aie recommended in the course of debate to
secretly sprinkle a few drops on the head of the hou. Member
seated immediately before them and watch the results for them-
selves. Sold in bottles at.!.-,. Od., os. Gd., 10s. (id., and '2ls.

1 which, by nrm but gentle and judicious pressure, directs
the soft cartilage of which tue nose consists, so that a periect shape
is obtained. Komaii nose, la. extra. It is requireU to be worn
an hour daily for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one dajs. It is
rather becoming to the expression than otherwise, and may be
worn at the Speaker's Levee. It is suited to all shades of politics,
and it never tails in producing good results. Its price is iOn. (Jd.
M.P.'s HAIK DKSTKOYEK OK DEPILATORY.—
JL Kemoves superfluous hair troiu the knuckles, neck, or
elbows without the slightest injury to the SKIII. in lamily circles
much innocent amusement may be deriveu now cutting a small
circle of cloth, soaking it in the Depilatory and placing it un-

hair, whether superfluous or not, comes away with it.

TIOBY, M.P.'s HAIR CUKLINCi FLUID.—No matter how
straight or otherwise ungovernable is your hair, the fluid
curls it immediately. There are authenticated cases where a
patient's hair curled right off at the sound of the drawing of
tke cork of a bottle of TOBY, M.P.'s Hair Curling Fluid. Extract

TIOBY, M.P.'s BLOOM OF NOSES.—So called from its deep
sunset effect. With addition of a little water it will bring
a blush to the most shameless cheek. For Members addicted to
fitting up late at night, reading blue-books or otherwise it will
be found invaluable.
TOBY, M.P.'s GREAT HAIR RESTORER.—It contains
nothing injurious or otherwise. Restores grey hair to
any tint you like in a few days. Has little sediment, and that
of the very best. Pending the growth of the hair it endows a
bald head with a beautiful gloss. A little taken internally before
going to bed is recommended. Can be had through all chemists
or of the maker, TOBY, M.P., The Kennel, Barks.
TOBY, M.P.'s TOILET NECESSARIES.—Out of a heap of
testimonials, the following are selected—The Marquis of
S-L-BB-RY. "In recent negotiations with Foreign Powers I used
TOBY, M.P.'s Hair Destroyer or Depilatory with remarkable effect.
After a few applications it caused to disappear British positions in
Central Africa to the advantage of Germany ; divided Zanzibar with
that country; and removed the superfluity of Heligoland from the
British Empire." From the Right Hon. J-S-PH CH-MB-BL-N—"I
ordered to be despatched to Mrs. KR-G-R, in time for delivery
at Christmas, a bottle of TOBY, M.P.'s Hair Curling Fluid. She
has sent for another bottle, remarking, that to curl O-M P-L'S

valuable mixture." From Sir W-LL-M H-EC-BT—" I tried one
bottle of TOBY, M.P.'s Great Hair Restorer with surprising
result. When in the course of three days my hair had grown a
foot long, I began to use the Hair Curling Fluid. Effect
picturesque in the extreme. Being undesirous of exciting envy
I had recourse to TOBY, M.P.'s Hair Destroyer or Depilatory,
which, after a severe struggle, removed the overgrowth, enabling
me to appear in the Houae in my old form." __

DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGE.
Two minor officials of the United States Embassy have success-
fully claimed the diplomatic privilege of riding bicycles on the
footpath at Maidenhead.
The butler of the Russian Ambassador is stated to have claimed
the right to ride his bicycle up and down the steps of St. Paul's.
An under-housemaid of the French Embassy intends to ride in
the Brompton omnibus without paying the fare.
The dogs of the Vice-Consul of San Marino are not muzzled,
their owner pleading privilege.
A man was yesterday charged at Bow Street with being drunk
and incapable. He stated that he had once cleaned the windows
at the German Embassy and was immediately released. Another
man, a shoeblack, was charged with picking pockets. Having
proved that, on the previous day, he nad blacked the boots of
the uncle by marriage of the second footman of the Italian
Embassy, he was liberated. A third man was charged with
assaulting his wife. He called witnesses to prove that his wife
had been washerwoman to the Spanish Ambassador, and he was
therefore at once discharged.
AT HER MAJESTY'S.—Mr. CHARLES ALLAN was "cast" for
I'm an He would have been anything but a " miserable Cinna."
Yet at the last moment he was omitted. Now, according to the
Westminster Gazette, this Cinna is to be forthwith "restored."
A "restore! Cinna" implies repentance; but, it is highly pro-
bable that Mr. ALLAN will still be about as thorough-going a
Cinna as ever was seen. Of course he has been taken by the
Cinna-matographic apparatus.

WHO among Gaiety patrons (within the
List twenty years, shall we say ?) does not
remember the humour and pathos of
NELLIE FARREN, when, as the little street
arab, that scapegrace Aladdin, in the late
ROBERT REECE'S burlesque, she sang, half
impudently, half beseechingly, with tearb
in her voice,
"Please, Sir, 'old yer nag, Sir?
Tyke yer little bag, Sir?
Werry 'ard to lire
Just wot yer '11 give
Thank 'ee, Sir!"
And now, partially paralysed and well-nigh
penniless, Miss NELLIE FARREN finds it
"worry 'ard to live"; and so "kind
friends in front" are doing their utmost
to "work a benefit " for her, the proceeds
of which, placed in the hands of two
business-like trustees, will be invested
"for the little lady" to the very best
advantage, and thus secure for her compe-
tence and comfort.

SONGS FOR THE NATION.
"Fairc les lois <Vim» nation? Chunsons que t< ut
cela !"—J o»siu-t-Poudiii.
THE "incomprehensible" style of draw-
ing-room ballad is, or ought to be, an im-
portant factor in our civilisation. It is a
convenient vehicle for melody, and has the
virtue of soothing the listener by a vague
glow of impressiveness to which it is im-
pcssible to attach any meaning. Unfortu-
nately, the effect is often marred by lapses
into coherence, which raise an irritating

My vanity vanish away;

The magical moan of a word.
Alas! with the light of the morning
To-morrow has flown to its rest,
With feverish petulance scorning
The hallowed delights of the blest.
I yearn, with a cynical mocking,
To grapple with infinite calm,

The tones of a jubilant psalm.

If only the star of derision
Would turn from its km to its kith;

And yesterday followed to-day,
My soul would eternity borrow,
And solemnly vanish away!

'INTS ON 'UNTING, BY 'ARRY.
IF, BY MISTAKE, YOU HAVE HALLOED A HAKE AWAY, WHEN OVT WITH FOXHOUNDS,
TELL TUB HUNTSMAN YOU THOUUHT THEY WEUE HAUKIKKK!
OVER THE DITCHES.
DETERMINE to have day's hunting in
Essex. Grand sporting country, big
ditches, and plenty of room across the
open Roothings. Find I must start by
8.50 train from Liverpool Street. Can't
be helped. Tell groom to have horse there
in good time. Looks sulky. Always does
when it's a matter of getting up early,
lazy beggar! Dine overnight with the
CHCNKINSES, who regard me as a hero.
Rather like this. Put on hardy look when
they pity me for having to rise so early.
To bed at midnight. No sooner asleep
than knock at door; "'arf past six, Sir,
and a foggy mornin'." D— bother it,
I mean. Put nose out of bed-clothes and
execrate hunting. Catch sight of tub,
shiver and duck under again. Five
minutes more, and then rush for tub,
emitting dismal howl as first cold sponge-
ful does its deadly work. Shave by candle-
light with cold fingers, tepid water, and
blunt razor. Cut chin. Again exclaim
d bother it. Cab at door as I pull
on left boot. Scald mouth with cup of tea,
and snatch up piece of toast to gnaw going
along. No time for more, and, strange to
snv. no anpetite. Cab damp, also stuffy.
Arrive Liverpool Street. Groom meet;
me, saying my brute declines to entei
horse-box, and is engaged in deadly com-
bat with whole of G. E. R. staff, from
stationmaster downwards. Train leaves in
three minutes. Rush frenziedly to strug-
gling group round horse-box, and aim
violent "whack" at the boast's qunrters
Miss him and hit porter in the eye. Porter
hurls whole of the English language at me
So rude. "Wy don't yer back 'im in?'
shouts friendly cabman. Of course; whj
didn't we think of it before? So silly.
Horse goes in like ship sailing "starn fore-
most." I rush to shut up side of horse-
box, as train is just off. Jam fingers in
hinge. D- jam it, I mean. "Now
then, Sir, jump in if you 're a-goin' on!"
shouts guard. Scramble into last carriage,
and we are off. Quite warm now, after
my exertions. Fog on line, and we stop
every ten yards. Dismal journey, and
arrive half an hour late. Get horse out,
and start on my ten-mile hack to meet.
Lose my way, and a,sk intelligent country-
man to direct me. I. C. raises hat and
scratches head.
"Wboy, now, if you was to foller this
'ere road straight as you c,xn go for about
vour mile, an' then tarn to yer right an"
go acrost a stone bridge an' leave the ' Fox
and Geuse' on yer left 'an' then tarn to
yer right agen, yew 'd be somers on the
road to where t" hounds did meet last
Toosday was a fortnit ago"
Thank him hastily, and pass on, saying
that I will call in for the rest of the ex-
planation when I have a week to spare.
Trot on, and presently see man in pink
ahead of me. Follow him, and duly arrive
at meet. Large field. Don't know a soul.
Every one stares at me and chats to his
neighbour. Feel uncomfortable. Wish
they wouldn't. Draw fiist cover blank.
My horse gets fidgetty and unpleasant.
Sidles up against big man, who scowls
savagely and mutters something about
Cockney sportsmen. Pretend not to hear.
Hound rushes wildly between my horse's
legs. Sagacious animal lets fly, and kicks
him yards. Fearful chorus of indignant
shouts to "take (hat bnrte home," and
inquiries as to whether I want to kill all
the pack?
Ignore them, smile in pitying manner,
ind light ciprar. Have only had six whiffs
when hounds find, and have to throw
Cabana away. Pull up my girths, which
makes horse lash out again, and very
nearly bag another hound. Away we all
gallop for small hand-gate which every
one tries to go through at once. My
brute arches his back, squeals and kicks at
every stride. Feel that there is much day-
light between self and proud animal at
intervals; frequent ones, too. Saddle hard,
cold, and slippery. Get through gate at
last, gate-post catching my knee, and caus-
ina roe to lose stirrup-iron, and exclaim
"D botheration!" Gallop over beau-
tiful bit of grass and jump several easy
ditches. Very nice country to ride over,
md all this talk nhnut gigantic Rnothing
ditches simnlv rubbish. Nothincr like as
big as Hullo! what's this? Navigable
river? Part of the Ship Canal? Forty-
foot saw-pit? No; only a real Roothing
ditch. Instantly try to pull up. Think
T Ml go round. Too late. Man in nink, just
in front. BOOS in head first and disappears
bodily. My horse makes frantic effort, but
jumps short, and we come down right on
'oo of unfortunate sportsman at bottom of
ditch. Vision of coroner's inquests, ver-
dict of manslauihter, Old Bailey, and
oenal servitude float mistilv before my
eyes. Wave arms about wildly, and seize
nose of the man I think I hive slain. We
sit up and face each other. He is not dead.
He smiles. He draws note-book from
breast-pocket. He speaks. And this is
what he savs : —
"I am the Hunt Secretary, Sir, and I
trust I may have the pleasure of putting
von down on my list as a ten-guinea sub-
scriber. Always as well to do business
when opportunity offers. Allow me to
hand von my card. Cheques should be
crossed London and County Bank."
And they call this "sleepy Essex "!

SONGS FOR THE NATION.
"Fairc lea loisd'tin* natinn? Ohnnsonsqueti ut

THE "incomprehensible" style of draw-
ing-room ballad is, or ought to be, an im-
portant factor in our civilisation. It is a
convenient vehicle for melody, and has the
virtue of soothing the listener by a vague
glow of impressiveness to which it is im-
possible to attach any meaning. Unfortu-
nately, the effect is often marred by lapses
into coherence, which raise an irritating
desire to know " what it is all about," and
then the soothing effect is lost. This is a
mistake, and I have done my utmost to
prehensible, and therefore of superlative
value to the nation at large.

A NEW ODE TO "DUTY."
STERN daughter—of no matter who!
0 Duty !—comprehensive name—
You are not " light <o guide," with you
Dancing ia but a weary game.
Your step ia in itself a law
Which no collisions overawe;
Like some fell motor-car set free
You jostle lound, unblessed of frail
humanity!
There are who care not if your eye
Be on them; others ask, in truth,
A dance, but cut it bv-and-byo
With all the genial cheek of youth
Glad hearts! They save themselves a lot
Of bumps, and know it—do they not?—
They once their confidence misplaced
In you, and now no more their arms ehal1
span your waist.
For this, methinks, were pure delight,
The haven where a man would be—-
To dance with whom one likes all night,
And, so to sneak, be Duty-free!
Yot they a dangerous course shall hold
"Who dare to live, unwisely boli,
Up to the spirit of this creed;
Nor uven give a sot of Lancers as your meet!.
I. loving freedom well, liavo tried
To bear the ill-corn oaJod disgust
Of fond mammas all stony-eyed.
Who in me have reposed their trust.
For oft when in my heart I 've Lea id
The call of Duty, 1 've deferred
The task, in smoither waltz to stray:
13ut now—I '11 have this extra polka, if ]
may!
Sti-rn Duty! Now I see you wear
A sort of smilo upon your face,
Th mgh my request you grant, I fea-,
With not tho very best of grace.
Confusion in your footing treads,
1 pray we fall not on our heads.
The while wo muke the giddy throng
Sit up in this wild polka, going fresh and
stroug.
To Providence's saving power
Our mad career I now commend,
This baddish quarter of an hour
Which I 'm about with you to spend!
*****
Meanwhile let men take my advice
And cultivate self-sacrifice,
So shall they fail offence to give.
And in the approving smiles of watchful
chaperones live!

THE TOQUE'S PROGRESS.
[" Owing to the enormously high trimmings now put upon smart hats and
toques, the ordinary brougham does not permit its fair occupant in full nftiT-
noon toilet to sit in comfort. Some of the leading onrrinpe-mnkera therefore
have had to lower the seats of many closed vehicles.'—Daily Tc/ryraph,¥ebA.]
THKRE is no such thing as finality in Fashion, and we may rest
assured that further developments are impending.
The seats of railway-carriages will he arranged on a sliding-scale.
Those of the third-class will perhaps remain as they are at pre-
sent, but the second-class, containing, presumably, better-dressed
lady-passengers, will be lowered a foot, while first-class compart-
ments w.'H have no seats at all. The wearers of the omnipotent
aigrette will cheerfully sit on the floor of the carriage, or possibly
on a foot-warmer. Gentlemen, of course, will have to stand,
or travel in horse-boxes. It is expected that later on railway
cuttin-js will be universal throughout the country, to meet the
increased depth required.
In theatres, the stalls will in future be constructed on the
hats will descend to the desired level, and, if necessary, disappear
below altogether. A much-needed reform will thus be brought
to pass.
Omnibuses will be converted into penny drays, but straw will
doubtless be provided for the convenience of female occupants,
where the pavement is at all rocky. No gentleman, it is ex-
pected, will hereafter hesitate to ride outside to oblige a lady.
Hansom cabs and growlers will be built without any floor.
Ladies of any standing at all will recline on the step, or walk
inside, like the historic Irishman, "for the look of the thing."
In the case of covered motor-cars, ladies will push them behind
like perambulators.
And then, and not till then, will the fiat go forth that feminine
hats are to be worn reasonably flat and low.
ACCORDING to the It'fxtminstrr Gazetft, there are ten teetotal
bishops. The watering-places abroad are generally in want of
chaplains. Here, then, is an opportunity for the teetotal bishops
principle of a stage-trap, through which the owners of matinee-
to appoint to water-cures.

DARBY JONES ON SPRING TOPICS.
HONOITRED SIR,—There are many tilings
associated with the mellifluous term
Spring, "to wit" (as they have it in
the mandatory and disagreeable orders
of HER MAJESTY'S Courts of Law),
Spring cabbages, Spring onions, Spring
guns, Spring flowrrs, and Spring handi-
caps. It is with the latter article that
1 have to deal, in the International Game
of Equine Whist, wherein a bottled-up
Knave often scores more readily than
a tip-top Queen, an irreproachable King,
or an Ace desirous of Cromwellian su-
premacy. Let us now, however, to the
Handicaps. By the way, why handy '<
Why caps' 1 reply, handy, because our
jockeys, like prizefighters, know how to
use their fists at a finish; caps because,
until horses are painted with the owners'
colours, they and the jackets must go
together, and on a dull day in winter, they
might just as well be displayed in Uno-
chrome. I turn in pursuance of that task,
which sets the compilation of a new Slang
Dictionary at defiance, to the unravelling
of the mesh which surrounds the Lincoln-
shire Handicap, run on Thursday. March
22, beneath the shade of one of the most
deftly renovated Cathedrals in England.
And in connection with this event the
Bard breaks forth in poesy : —
The Medley seems bright
When it's rid of the Kniylit,
And Lord Rosebery'* may have a look in.
There 's a King with a chance,
And a Stoic in the dance,
But I look to a iS'rtiwf for a book win!
So says the Augur, and with that know-
ledge only derived from the Study of a
Lifetime, he gnllops over Aintree "in In*
anticipation of the Grand National:—
I don't think a Declaration
Will be source ot'jubilation,
I 'd rather have a little bit on Tu-n from
And tliiT« 'B u certain H'tnU
Whom to beat it will be hard,
But matters I '11 not mince.
If game and good the Prince,
He '11 ttummox all the lot in proper style.
This, honoured Sir, is my beginning, the
A of my Alphabet. By the time we come
to Z, nay, long before that, you and my
clients should be travelling about the
country in personally-owned motor-cars.
But alas1 for the Ingratitude of Mankind.
Many of those who are now making pigeon-
pies at Monte Carlo owe not a little of
their well-being to the acute foresight of
Your humble henchman and heeler,
DABBY JONM.
A FROSTLESS JANUARY.
THE plumber wrung his hands and wept.
No frost! How hard tor those adept
At mending "pipes that 's busted!"
The butcher groaned to think of meat
The mildness made unfit to eat,
Such winter he distrusted.
The merchant of neglected coal
Consumed in grief his stricken soul,
Top utterly disgusted.
The ice-rink man alone was glad;
No frost, except indoors; it had
Been perfectly adjusted.

"PETER, DIDST EVER SEE THE LIKE?"
Taming of the Shrete, Act IV., Sc. 1.
IT seems a pity that Peter the Oreat should be dethroned.
Rarely has our Sir HENRY been seen to greater advantage, in
every way, than as the eccentric Czar; and well is he seconded
by our American cousin, Mr. ROBERT TABEB, while Mr. MACKIN-
TOSH is once again the very best of spies. Had Mr. IBVINO, Junr.
the author, only been able to render the female characters equally
effective, and to have given (what GOETHE asked for) "more
light" to the sombre drama, it might have held the stage, and
the audience, for a considerable period. Perhaps there yet may
be seen a second and improved edition. However, the fiat has
gone forth, and once more "The Bells will be ringing for IRVING ";
Shylock will make another desperate attempt to get a pound of
Antonio's flesh, and ELLEN TERRY will delight us all as the light-
hearted blanthitteuse, Madame Sans-Gene.
A GOOD PUFF.—The Bishop of LONDON, during a recent inter-
view, is said to have smoked seventeen cigarettes. In answer to
numerous inquiries aa to whose cigarettes these were, whether
made by Messrs. —— or Messrs. , we are able to state posi-
tively that they were the Bishop B— unless they were the inter
Animalgarden in the Summer, when the Air fresh and warm, and
viewer's.

DARBY JONES ON SPRING TOPICS.
HONOURED SIR,—There are many things
associated with the mellifluous term
Spring, "to wit" (as they have it in
the mandatory and disagreeable orders
of HER MAJESTY'S Courts of Law),
Spring cabbages, Spring onions, Spring
guns, Spring flowers, and Spring handi-
caps. It is with the latter article that
I have to deal, in the International Game
of Equine Whist, wherein a bottled-up
Knave often bcores more readily than
a tip-top Queen, an irreproachable King,
or an Ace desirous of Cromwellian su-
premacy. Let us now, however, to the
Handicaps. By the way, why handy'(
Why capsP I reply, handy, because our
jockeys, like prizefighters, know how to
use their fists at a finish; caps because,
until horses are painted with the owners'
colours, they and the jackets must go
together, and on a dull day in winter, they
might just as well be displayed in Uno-
chrome. I turn in pursuance of that task,
which Bets the compilation of a new Slang
Dictionary at defiance, to the unravelling
of the mesh which surrounds the Lincoln-
shire Handicap, run on Thursday. March
22, beneath the shade of one of the most
deftly renovated Cathedrals in England.
And in connection with this event the
Bard breaks forth in poesy :—
The Medley seems bright
When it's rid of the Kiiiy/i/,
And Lord Soitbery's may have n look in.
There's a King with a chance,
And a 6'fotr in the dance,
But I look to a Saint for a book win!
So says the Augur, and with that know-
ledge only derived from the Study of a
Lifetime, he gallops over Aintree in Ins
anticipation of the Grand National:—
I don't think a Declaration
Will be eource ot'jubilation,
I 'd rather have n little bit on Two from
Ami tboro '« u certain H'arU
Whom to bent it will be hard,
But matters I '11 not mince,
If game and good the Prince,
He '11 flummox all the lot m proper etylf.
This, honoured Sir, is my beginning, the
A of my Alphabet. By the time we come
to Z, nay, long before that, you and my
clients should be travelling about the
country in personally-owned motor-cars.
But alas' tor the Ingratitude of Mankind.
Many of those who are now making pigeon-
pies at Monte Carlo owe not a little of
their well-being to the acute foresight of
Your humble henchman and heeler,
DABBY JONKS.
A FROSTLESS JANUARY.
THE plumber wrung his hands and wept.
No frost! How hard tor those adept
At mending "pipes that'» busted!"
The butcher groaned to think of meat
The mildness made unfit to eat,
Such winter he distrusted.
The merchant of neglected coal
Consumed in grief his stricken soul,
Top utterly disgusted.
The ice-rink man alone was glad;
No frost, except indoors; it had
Been perfectly adjusted.

Kinlly understand i that he no germau Silver take will. I

"Kan You this change if" "Yes, Alaunsiah," say he, "but You

Coacher cry out, the Horse jump, and sudden am i downtalled,

I see .Nothings, i must to the Coacher spiek. But how? He
is behind. 1 kan not the \\indow open, so seek i round the

Waggonstep to go, so endly stand i up, and grasp after one of
the leathern Straps, which, as i nau see, the Kains are. 1 must
the Horse stop.
That do i. It go sudden towards the Side, i fall yet again,
thistime tail the ilorse likewise, the Teikekeb go down, i roll

"Never again go i in Your accursed Droschke." Ihe Coacher
stand up, he pull the Horse up, and then spiek he mutsch and
violent. We are alone in the nebulous Darkness. I am greater
aa he, but i am plump, and i am hurted. He hold his Whip, he
say, "You bluznin Fui offer furriner"—was ist dasf—he »ay
mutsch more, he say often that i blutig am, that the Horse blutig
is, that All blutig is, witch not true is, because we only bruised,
not wounded, are, and i no Blood see kan, he shout, he wave
his Whip, and endly say he, "One Quid." "What is that?"
ask i. "Twenty Bob," say he, "one Pound." Himmel, zwanzig
Mark!
That shall i not to him give. But he lift his Whip up, and i
bring mein Twentymarkbits from mein Purse out. He say he
take no "blumin germau Money." I say to him that i no other
have, so endly take he too Twentymarkbits, and spiek frendlyer.
He say the Fog so thick is, that he the Horse leed must, and as
i in one Teikekeb nevermore up step shall, so go we to Foot quite
slow. Ach Himmel! In Germany as Younger have i me mutsch
with the Turnunion in the Turnhall exersised, but now am i no
Walkgoer, because i too plump am.
It is fierful long. Tscherringross is, without Daut, ten Kilo-
meter from Londonbritsch. The Fog is so fieriul thick,
and i am so fierful weary, that i Nothings observe kan.
Since seven or eigt Hours have i Nothings eated. From Time

wait we in order one Glas Bier to drink. But it give Nothings

Coacher ask yet ten Mark. I am so weary that i not dispute

Flasks Bier, and even so rasch as possibly go i to Bed.
Highattentionsfull humblest LUDWIQ.
"PETER, DIDST EVER SEE THE LIKE?"
Taming of the Shrew, Act IV., Sc. 1.
IT seems a pity that Peter the Great should be dethroned.
Rarely haa our Sir MKMIY been seen to greater advantage, in
every way, than as the eccentric Czar; and well is he seconded
by our American cousin, Mr. ROBERT TABER, while Mr. MACKIN-
TOSH is once again the very best of spies. Had Mr. IRVING, Junr.
the author, only been able to render the female characters equally
effective, and to have given (what GOETHE asked for) more
light" to the sombre drama, it might have held the stage, and
the audience, for a considerable period. Perhaps there yet may
be seen a second and improved edition. However, the fiat has
gone forth, and once more "The Bells will be ringing for IRVINO ";
Shylock will make another desperate attempt to get a pound of
Antonio's flesh, and ELLEN TEKRY will delight us all as the light-
hearted llanchisseuse, Madame Sans-Gene.
A GOOD PUFF.—The Bishop of LONDON, during a recent inter-
view, is said to have smoked seventeen cigarettes. In answer to
numerous inquiries as to whose cigarettes these were, whether
made by Messrs. or Messrs. , we are able to state posi-
tively that they were the Bishop s—unless they were the inter-
Animalgarden in the Summer, when the Air fresh and warm, and
viewer's.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.

House of Commons, Tuesday morning,
February 9.—S.MIK often compares House
of Commons to a public school. In the
main he is right; points of resemblance
crop up nearly every day through a Ses-
sion. Analogy breaks down at one epoch.
Members differ from schoolboys, inasmuch
as they are as delighted to get back for
fresh term as they were boisterously hila-
rious on breaking up for holidays.
Since ten o'clock this morning, House,
lobbies, reading-room, and library thronged
with Members pleased with themselves and
each other. Some audibly chortled in their
joy. Such shaking of hands! such slapping
on the back! such hearty enquiry after
everybody's health 1 Might be the first re-
union in a safe place of shipwrecked and
temporarily parted passengers.
"Yes, it's all very wellj TOBY mein,"
said PRINCE ARTHUR, standing by me and
looking on the animated scene. "What's
sport to them is death to us. For just six
months we 've done without the House of
Commons, not to mention the House of
Lords. I 'm not going to say that we have
managed throughout with unvaried, un-
qualified success. But whatever we've
done we should, in similar circumstances,
have done exactly the same had Parlia-
ment been sitting. We should have done
it, too, in our own way at our own time.
Yet tl.ink of all the rumpus that would
ineffectually have accompanied our pa-
triotic labours. There would have been
questions clay by day, which, pleading the
interests of the State, we should have de-
clined to answer, or at best should have
dribbled forth information. There would
have been motions for the adjournment,
smothering anything like incipient revolt
on our side. There would have been talk, i
talk, talk, and the end would have been
precisely as it is fashioned to-day. I begin
to think that, after all, CARLYLE, himself,
you know, much averse from talking, was
right in his contempt for our dear House
of Commons. Now here they are again,
bursting with wanting-to-know-you-know,
and every other man in the throng with
an Amendment to the Address in his'.
pocket. Much better for all of us if they
would let me give them right off another
six months' holiday."
"Mr. SPEAKER!" It is the voice of the
doorkeeper. I hear him complain. "Hats
off, strangers!" and through the throng
of bared heads the SPEAKER, in wig and
gown, his skirt upheld by his train-bearer,
passes with dignified pace into the House,
to begin all over again the old, old round
of duties, delights, and other things.

Question. Has the anxious parent been
to see his child's portrait?
Answer. He has seen it.
Q. Did he approve of it?
A. He will like it better when I have
made some slight alterations.
Q. What are they?
A. He would like the attitude of the
figure altered, the position of the arms
changed, the face turned the other way,
the hair and eyes made a different colour,
Q. Did he make any other suggestions?
A. Yes; he wishes to have the child's
favourite pony and Newfoundland dog put
in, with an indication of the ancestral
home in the background.
Q. Is he willing to pay anything extra
for these additions?
A. He does not consider it necessary.
Q. Are you well on with your Academy

A. No; but I began the charcoal sketch
yesterday.
Q. Have you secured the handsome
model?
A. No; the handsome model has been
permanently engaged by the eminent R.A.
Q. Under these circumstances, do you
still expect to get finished in time?
A. Yes; I have been at this stage in
February for as many years as I can re-

worry through somehow.

rules by which they have attained longe-

to gladden their leisure hours. He is, of
course, gratified to find himself the object
of so much solicitude on the part of his
readers, but at the same time he finds it
difficult to follow the advice of all. "Sep-

by a theatre, and supper with plenty of

"Nonagenarian" declares that "the secret
of long life lies in a cold tub taken every
morning, winter and summer, with unfail-

writes, "Beware of soap and water—they

"Liver," on the contrary, writes, "Dear

believe that "Irishman" had hit the nail

The Confession of Stephen Whapshare (HtrrcHiNSON) is a story
as powerful as it is unpleasant. Mrs. (OE Miss) EMMA BROOKE
draws a vivid picture of a pretty, selfish clingar to the outer shell
of religious life mated to a strong-willed, deep-passioned,
ambitious man. As a work of art it is admirable. But Aiy
Baronite fancies the majority of people take up a novel in search
of pleasurable rest. This is not found in the company, the
household, or the environment of Stephen Whapshare and his
wife. The only time the heart warms towards him is when he
gets rid of Mrs. W. by an overdose of chloral.
The Liltertl Magazine, just issued from the Liberal Publica-
tion Department, 42, Parliament Street, is recommended for the
use of Liberal speakers and canvassers. It need not necessarily
be limited to that school of politician, being full of information
on a wide range of public matters. Volume V. forms a political
record for the yenr 1897, which, with the assistance of a complete
index, may, my Baronite says, be turned to with advantage in
the coming year.
Falkland! (LONGMANS & Co.), by the author of The Life of
Sir Kenelni Digby, is the pleasantly told story of a statesman
who had been as unsuccessful in politics as in warfare, and not eo
extraordinarily happy in his home. That Lucius CARY was cou-
rageous is shown by his conduct in action; and that he was rash
in sppech is evident from his bold attempt at making a pun out of
the most hopeless verbn' materials. Not even one of WILLIAM
SHAKSPFARE'S clowns could have said anything more feeble than
Hiil Lord FALKLAND when he replied to HYDE that " a Secretary in
War may be present at the greatest secret of danger." Indeed,
"a lame pun," as the author says in a foot-note. Lord FALK-
LAND, when he made this essay in punning, was just thirty-three,
and ought to have known better. On the other hand, it must be
borne in mind that he was not aware of the presence of " a chiel
amang ye. tnkin' notes, an" faith h« '11 nrent it," and so probably
indulged in a witticism which he considered just about up to the
level of his companion's comprehension. The book and its illus-
trations are most interesting. THE BARON DK B.-W.
TO INTENDING JUDGES.
THE innocence of the Bench is a thing of the past. Nowadays
a judge must be omniscient. He must no longer ask counsel to
explain the meaning of the expression "Derby Day": on the
contrary, he must be prepared to instruct a "bookie " in the art
of betting, or to explain to a milliner the difference between
Roman and ordinary satin. Indeed, Mr. Punch hears that m
future candidates for judicial honours are to be subjected to a
rigorous examination in General Information, of which the fol-
lowing test-paper has been handed to him as a sample : —
1. Explain the terms "box-pleat," "gusset," "pouf," "chev-
rette," "plastron," "revers," "placket-hole," "foundation,"
"shaped yoke," "combinations."
2. Give the genus, species and property of "molleton," " cpche-
mire,"" tulle," "chiffon," " sarcenet," " broche silk," "glace silk,"
"guipure,." Sketch from these materials a toilette to suit a
short, stout witness of forty-five.
3. Translate into English the following passage from a ladies'
journal, commenting on the prammar and the words italicised :—
"The five-gore skirt is fitted without Harts, and measures about
3} yards round hem, pattern being used for cutting lining and
material, which make up together, and in cutting; out place
centre front to a fold to avoid senm, front side of back pore to
selvedge, and the line of oblong holes inside gore on the straight
nf material."
4. Give the dates of the following Sprint? meetings : —New-

ton. Mention the probable starters (with age and weight) for

5. At what price did Pend Or start when he won the Derby?
Supposing that he and Persimmon were running in the same
year, estimate the odds for snd arrainst either.
6. Give tha names, weights, length, brendth and thickness
of the Oxford and Cambridge crows from 1R80.
7. Give the hitting averages to date of STODDART'S team, and
the bowling analyses of anv thrre Australians.
8. Distinguish, if possible, between the terms, "sparrinn

you include the recent fight at the National Sportinf Club?
9. Explain the woifh " Par," "Tiv," "Jimmy's." Write down

SELECTION FROM THE PICKWICK COSMOPOLITAN PORTRAIT GALLERY.
[" Mr. I'ERCY FITZOSHALD has told us that Piekirirk has been made a Dutchman, a Herman, a Norwegian, a Dane, and also a Jap, and has been
claimed by the people of these countries as ono of themselves."—San.]
BRIEFLESS IN RE ZOLA.
IT is my opinion that it would be distinctly out of place to
hazard a suggestion anent the recent trial in Paris while the
matter remains sub judice. But when I say this, I mean that the
cause should be sacred so far as forensic judgment is concerned.
I do not know why the ceremony observed on the other side
of the Channel should not give a hint to those responsible for the
Erocedure in the Royal Courts of Justice. Speaking for myself,
can say that there is a sad jack of enthusiasm in our Divisions,
especially on the Chancery side. During the course of a career
now becoming a lengthy one, I have scarcely ever caused the
Bench to nod approvingly, much less to cheer. I have in my
mind a case—one to which reference is frequently made in the
Carey Street robing-room—which, had it been heard in France,
would have gone, to use a colloquialism, with shouts. It was
known as Jirmcn v. Smith and Simkins. To make my meaning
clearer, I will give a report as the hearing might have been had
Paris, and not London, been the site of the trial of the action.
I will adopt the dramatic form, as the more convenient for
reporting.
Judge. Who appears in this action?
Q. C. No. 1. I, my Lord, for Mr. BROWN.
Q. 0. No. 2. And I, my Lord, for Mr. SMITH.
Mr. Briefless. And I, my Lord—I say, I for Mr. SIMKINS.
Judge. You, Mr. BRIEFLESS?
Mr. ]i. Yes, my Lord; and permit me to say, my Lord, with
all respect to your Lordship, that the man who would not protect
his client's interests as his own is unworthy of the name of an
utter barrister. [Loud cheers.
Judge. I must beg you, Mr. BRIEFLESS, to make no speeches.
Mr. B. My Lord, I have the greatest respect for the British
Bench. I hold your Lordship in the deepest personal esteem.
But I value more than life itself the liberty which opens the
mouth of the advocate, and supplies copy to the pen of the
hard-working, noble-minded and conscientious reporter!
[Loud cheering, in which the gentlemen of the press join with
heartiness.
Judge.. I do not quite follow you, Mr. BRIEFLESS, but the time
will no doubt arrive when I shall be glad to hear you.
Mr. B. Asking your Lordship's pardon, I declare that the
time has arrived. I appeal to England, to Europe, the whole
world! I say that free speech is the birthright of the British-
born, that silence is the badge of slavery, and that JOHN BULL
will never, never consent to a condition of serfdom. Yes, my
Lord, I declare this, and intimate with infinite respect that
Britannia rules the waves and unfurls the banner of freedom.
[Renewed cheering.
Judge. That may be so, Mr. BRIEFLESS, but if I am to hear
you, you must put your arguments in common form.
Mr. It. My Lord, I have done my duty, and am prepared to
die for my country. [Enthusiastic cheering.
Judge. As you are a member of the Bar, I am forced to believe
you. But I would point out that you are wandering from the
point.
Mr. B. No, my Lord, with the utmost respect to your Lord-
ship I declare I am not. I speak, and with the fiat of the
people's will. [Loud cheers.
Judge. If you are interested in wills, Mr. BUIEFLRSS, you
should take your arguments to the Probate, Divorce, and Admi-
ralty Division.
Mr. B. This is trifling, my Lord. (Murmurs.) Yes, mj
Lord, this is trifling. I appeal to your Lordship to save the
honour of the Empire, to salute that flag that has brayed the
battle and the breeze for scores of years, nay, centuries—the
Union Jack. [Ihlthvritutie cheering.
Judge. Certainly. But, Mr. BRIEFLESS, what are your objec-
tions to the order I propose to make—all parties agreeing?
Mr. B. I do not object, my Lord. No, my Lord, on the
contrary, I support your Lordship. I do this in the sacred cause
of virtue, innocence, and truth. I do this because I hold that
grandest emblem of perfect humanity—a brief of consent both
for plaintiff and defendant'
\Tumultufius applause, during whith Mr. BRIEFLESS resumes
his seat amidst the hearty congratulations of a score
of solicitors.
Such might have been the report of the cause celebre to which
I have referred, had Gallic precedent been acknowledged and
followed. As it was, the affair—so far as I was concerned—occu-
pied about five seconds.
Under these circumstances I am distinctly of opinion that the
procedure in our Courts calls earnestly for immediate revision.

OUR LITERARY PARAGRAPHS.
MR. SNOOKS, the eminent novelist, has been greatly annoyed
by the inaccurate accounts of his methods of work which have
appeared in certain of our ill-informed contemporaries. The
statement, for instance, that this distinguished writer uses a
quill is absolutely untrue; he writes invariably with a gilt J.
We may add, on the best authority, that he prefers smooth
paper, and that he attaches his sheets of MS. to each other by
means of brass paper-fasteners. This most important informa-
tion has never been divulged before. Mr. SNOOKS is at present
w-orking on his new story, which is to appear as a serial in the
Whitechapel Ga:ette.

DARBY JONES ON THE FALLACY OF
btING TOO CLEVER.,
HONOURED SIR,—Just when the Spor
of Emperors, Kings, Princes, Dukes, Mar-
quises and other .Leaders of Creation is
about to put its nose through the soil like
the Disraelic Primrose—1 reler to the .Legi-
timate or I1 hit -raring pursuit, whereat Lin-
coln leads the fashion, and is likely to have
its local traditions enriched by the success-
ful canonisation of a Transatlantic Saint—
1 would like to say a few words gathered
from the sayings of old geese and ganders
for the benefit of the guslings who are as
yet unaccustomed to the stubble. It is
about this time of year that the Inexperi-
enced Descendant of the Biped, which
saved the City of Home and is very fami-
liar to us at the Feast ot St. Micnael, in
lured into wagering at least a Moiety ot
his Kxpectatioiis on such contests as the
Two Thousand Guineas Stakes and the
Derby. With the avidity of a Chub in the
Maytty season, he swallows seven, nay, six
or hve to one about animals, which may
be, long before the day of the race, lame,
scratched, or even dead. If the Gosling
wants to have a run for his money, far
better would it be for him to plank down
his " spondulicks" ( 1 use a flash idiom) on
some selling plater, which, by reference to
the daily papers, he may note has " arrived"
at this or that meeting. But unfortu-
nately the Gosling, like the great Mr.
HORATIO BOTTOMLEY, wants to be con-
nected with a Great Enterprise such as the
Derby, and he- will take ridiculous odds
about Hawfinch, Disraeli,, Uieudonne,
ifatt or L'ollar, over the Tattenham Cornei
event, without ever considering that he
is perilling his share in the Bank of Eng-
land at prices at which an honest stock-
broker would quiver with laughter.
The whole system, honoured Sir, ot
giving a betting return long beforehand
on Big Races is one fostered by the Book-
making Fraternity—not that I blame the
members of this unselect association. If
1 knew how to promote a Great Spring
Asparagus or Green Pea Prize, and could
lay odds against the first grower in the
open ground, I would take a whole page in
;he Daily Telegraph (quite apart from the
ever-genial "Hotspur") to advertise my
scheme. But I should want to be in the
know." And that is what Mr. Gosling
iluays thinks he is. He is, in his own
opinion, more clever than King SOLOMON,
and infinitely superior to Lord SALISBURY
u his acquaintance with Men and Things
—men being Owners, Trainers, and
Jockeys; and things four-legged creatures
who are treated with far more considera-
tion than their Human Contemporaries. I
can see you smile at this assertion, but did
you ever know a Man, and I will even say,
a Woman, who would fetch ten or fifteen
hnus,mi I pounds, to say nothing of having
been tenderly nurtured for years, and
given columns of displayed print in the
eading Journals of the Day? Why, Sir, I
make bold to say that personally my carcase
would not realise the price of cats'-meat.
But re venom a nos tries (I picked this up
at the Cafe de la Paix in the fair city of
Paris), the sportive Gosling, from the mo-
nent that he hatches out from the egg cf
Bton and Oxford or that of Harrow and
Cambridge—you know, honoured Sir, that
he public school of St. Giles and the uni-
versity of Clare Market have been my

Macftab (whose wife has met with a sligld accident on the Railway, to Railway Agent, who has
ailed to offer condolence, and produces one or two pounds ly way of solatium). "NA, NA, IK SHE
1EES IT WILL LIKELY BE TWA OR THREE HUNDEKS!"
•r Mr. DICK DUNN points over questions
)f betting, and on obscure discussions he
ould tell you off the reel that the racing
olours of the Chevalier GINISTHELLI are
white and blue hoops, blue sleeves, with
white cap; and that KITCHENER, in 1844,
won the Chester Cup riding only 3 st. 7 Ib.
Jut this sort of knowledge doesn't make a
ortune. So let me warn Mr. Gosling
gainst the "mug-catcher," or he will him-
self turn out to be a "fly flat." Such is
he Jargon of the Vulgar, "according to
he ideas of the Strictly Correct." Go
pon a race-course and hear if the Upper
Ton (not Upper Ten, please, Mr. Printer),
don't know how to slash around words not
Johnson's Dictionaries. The proof of the
"poured in" (language) is the beating. At
Manchester, Sir, I implore you not to for-
get the " Distressful Country," which, ~vhat
with Football Matches and Timber-topping,
must now be pretty full of Sassenach gold.
When I implore, I can say no more than
sign myself Your devoted dog-trotter,
DARBY JONES.

OUR BOOKLNQ-OJPPIGK
IN portly volumes, published by LONGMANS, Mr. WILFRID
WARD tells the story of the Life and Tines of Cardinal
Witcmun. The two comprise nearly twelve hundred pages
of type, much of it smaller than is usually found in works
of tnia character. On his death-bed the Cardinal suiumeu
up his life's object and his hle's work in a single sentence.
"i have never," he said, "cared tor anything but the
Church." England was the outlying pasture committed to
his cultivation and he threw himself into the work with a
self-devotion, a splendid energy, that commanded success. As
Mr. \\.uui hnely puts it, he round his coreligionists in Eng-
land a persecuted sect; he left them a Church. When, nearl}
titty years ago, Dr. WISEMAN came to London as Emissary of the
Pope, the English Catholic body was a heterogeneous team.
There wero various orders and congregations of secular priests,
Jesuits, Dominicans, Passionists, Kedemptorists, Oratorians,
Rosminians, each striving to win over England in its own
way, and place her salvation to its personal credit. WISEMAN'S
efforts were directed to amalgamating these forces, marching
them in ordered campaign. A masterful man, not mincing lan-
guage when rebuke or exhortation was called tor, he sometimes
troif troubled ways. The storm that arose in England on his
returning from Koine with the rank of Cardinal was sufficient to
have blown a punier man clear off the island. The Cardinal
stood foursquare to it, and lived it down. To the present gene-
ration the most vivid recollection of the episode is contained in
the memorable Punch cartoon, appearing when the Ecclesiastical
Titles Bill was passing through Parliament, representing Lord
JOHN RVSSELL writing up "No Popery" on the Cardinal's door
in Golden Square and running away. We get a last view of the
Cardinal a few days before his death, when the Canons assembled
to receive his dying confession of faith. He would not, by reason
of weakness of flesh, shirk any of the ceremonial. He insisted
upon being fully vested. So, wearing his rochet, his red
mozzetta and zuchetto, his pectoral cross, his gold stole and his
sapphire ring, he took leave of his co-workers. A frail dying
mortal, but a Prince of the Church to the last.
Wre are all familiar with the name of ARTHUR YOUNG, and
assume to Lave read bis Travels in France. The real man is
vividly revealed in his autobiography, edited by M. BETHAM-
EDWAKDS, and published, with portraits and illustrations, by I
SMITH, ELDER. Till religious monomania got a firm hold upon
him and blindness completed his misery, he lived a useful,
bustling life. Incidentally we get glimpses of English country
life at the end of the last century, and once or twice come
within sound of the voices of PITT and BURKE. Few things
written in more pretentious history give a vivider picture of the
state of the country during the height of NAPOLEON'S power than
flashes in a note from ARTHUR YOUNG, dated December 8, 1803.
"A letter," he says, "from Lord EUSTON to Sir CHARLES DAVERS
recommends that, in case of invasion, all horses and draft cattle
that cannot be driven out of reach of the enemy be shot, and
that all axle-trees or wheels of all carriages likely to fall into the
enemies' hands be broken." It was the death of his favourite
daughter, BOBBIN, that led to YOUNG'S final state of dementia.
There are some pathetic passages in the autobiography, de-
scribing how "I hoed part of my dear child's garden under
the window, and carried her bonnet and cap to her chamber."
He had the body buried under the flagging of his pew, fixing ths
coffin " so that when I kneel it will be between her head and her
dear heart." A very remarkable man, and a profoundly inte-

"You NEEDN'T BE FRIGHTENED, SWEETHEART. HE WON'T HURT

OUK BOUKING-OmCE.
IN portly volumes, published by LONGMANS, Mr. WILFRID
U Aim tells the story of the Life and Times of Cardinal
Wiseman. The two comprise nearly twelve hundred pages
of type, much of it smaller than is usually found hi works
of this character. On his death-bed the Cardinal sumineu
up his lile's object and his lire's work in a single sentence.
"1 have never," he said, "cared lor anything but the
Church." England was the outlying pasture committed to
his cultivation and he threw himself into the work with a
self-devotion, a splendid energy, that commanded success. As
Mr. WAKII finely puts it, he lound his coreligionists in Eng-
land a persecuted sect; he left them a Church. When, nearlj
nlty years ago, i)r. WISEMAN came to London as Emissary of the
Pope, the English Catholic body was a heterogeneous team.
There wero various orders and congregations of secular priests,
Jesuits, Dominicans, Passionists, Kedemptorists, Oratorians,
Rosminians, each striving to win over England in its own
way, and place her salvation to its personal credit. WISEMAN'S
efforts weie directed to amalgamating these forces, marching
them in ordered campaign. A masterful man, not mincing lan-
guage when rebuke or exhortation was called tor, he sometimes
trod troubled ways. The storm that arose in England on his
returning from Rome with the rank of Cardinal was sufficient to
have blown a punier man clear off the island. The Cardinal
stood foursquare to it, and lived it down. To the present gene-
ration the most vivid recollection of the episode is contained in
the memorable launch cartoon, appearing when the Ecclesiastical
Titles Bill was passing through Parliament, representing Lord
JOHN RUSSELL writing up "No Popery" on the Cardinal's door
in Golden Square and running away. We get a last view of the
Cardinal a few days before his death, when the Canons assembled
to receive his dying confession of faith. He would not, by reason
of weakness of flesh, shirk any of the ceremonial. He insisted
upon being fully vested. So, wearing his rochet, his red
mozzettii and zuchetto, his pectoral cross, his gold stole and his
sapphire ring, he took leave of his co-workers. A frail dying
mortal, but a Prince of the Church to the last.
W:e are all familiar with the name of ARTHUR YOUNG, and
assume to have read his Travels in France. The real man is
vividly revealed in his autobiography, edited by M. BETHAM-
EDWAKDS, and published, with portraits and illustrations, by
SMITH, ELDER. Till religious monomania got a firm hold upon
him and blindness completed his misery, he lived a useful,
bustling life. Incidentally we get glimpses of English country
life at the end of the last century, and once or twice come
within sound of the voices of PITT and BURKE. Few things
written in more pretentious history give a vivider picture of the
state of the country during the height of NAPOLEON'S power than
flashes in a note from ARTHUR YOUNG, dated December 8. 1803.
"A letter," he says, "from Lord EUSTON to Sir CHARLES DAVERS
recommends that, in case of invasion, all horses and draft cattle
that cannot be driven out of reach of the enemy be shot, and
that all axle-trees or wheels of all carriages likely to fall into the
enemies' hands be broken." It was the death of his favourite
daughter, BOBBIN, that led to YOUNG'S final state of dementia.
There are some pathetic passages in the autobiography, de-
scribing how "I hoed part of my dear child's garden under
the window, and carried her bonnet and cap to her chamber."
He had the body buried under the flagging of his pew, fixing tti3
coffin " so that when I kneel it will be between her head and her
dear heart." A very remarkable man, and a profoundly inte-

"You NEEDN'T BE FRIGHTENED, SWEETHEART. HE WON'T IIVKT
YOU. SEE, HE 's WAGGING HIS TAIL!"

"MUMMY TOLD MB SOI"
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I have seen it stated that the mummies
of ANTIOCHUS SOTER and PTOLEMY II., recently sold by auction,
could be certified genuine by letters from Dr. BIRCH and Professor
BONOMI. There must be some blundering inversion here.
Surely what is wanted is not a letter from BONOMI, saying, "This
is PTOLEMY," but rather a letter from PTOLEMY, saying, This is
Bone o' me." Yours in (G. H.) Mummy mood,
PRO BONO MEO.
[This is a Hzz-iual absurdity. No mummified (G. H. or otherwise) PTOLEMY
could write such a letter, whatever his tendency to rot (extra sec). We sup-
pose our correspondent would complain of another " bluudering inversion" in
which letters played a part, if we characterised his levity as " abouomible."]

LUDW1G IN LONDON.
LEKNIXG TUB LANGUAGE.
HONOURED MISTER,—Six weeks ago I came in London, and I
sent you some letters which you have given out. Since then I have
i tudied the english language each day and the whole day, I have
had conversation-lessons, writing-lessons, reeding-lessons, and I
no it endly quite good. Only the orthography is so very difficult.
At first I new not that in english one writes the most substantivs
with a little letter at the beginning. 1 have also lernt, what is
curiouser, that ich is "I" and tiie is "you." How a German is
politer than a Englishman! Not true? He writes "i," quite
humble, and "You," quite polite. A Frenchman even writes
jc, not Je. Only a Englishman is so consieted that he writes
always "I," as big as possible. Dusent he?
I remained only a day at the hotel, and then, in order to speak
english always, I moved to a boardinghouse in the South Ken-
singtown quarter of London, where a relative of me stayed one
time. So I have spoken enough, because in a Pension, in any
land, people speak without ceasing. But this house is good and
dear, so i lern the best english from the guests. One of them,
a young Advokat, barrister, who must speak very good becauso
he was a student of the university of Oxford, says, "The old
tabbys jaw like one o'clock." I have seeked these words in my
dictionary, and I find that he speaks not of the boarders, as 1
supposed, but of the cats, who truly make a awful row during
the whole night, and not only at one o'clock, in the so-called
garden of this house.
Between my lessons I have visited some of the Sehenswiirdig-
keiten, the things worthy of seeing, in London. I think them
not up top much, because they all are so old and so dirty. There
english, and it is certainly the colour of bran, with some gray
marks. The young barrister said it was made to imitate Stillton
cheese. His face was quite grave, or I had thought he joked.
That is very interesting. I shall tell you of the tilings worthy
of seeing in other letters.
In order to leru a language it is very useful to go in the
theatre. Naturely one can not understand the dialekt in H
Volkstheater, peoplestheater; one must go to the Hof Theater,
court theater, in a strange town. So 1 ask one day where is the
court theater in London, and they say it is unfar from the
boardinghouse. I go therefore one evening. I go no more in a
"keb," since my journey from Londonbridge to Cherringross,
when I paid sixty shilling, and was nearly killed. DonnerwetteT!
In London there are no horseways—ah no, you say tramsways—-
as in Berlin. Even in Leipzig they go everywhere every minute.
1 can not walk. So I go in a "fourwheeler." The door is so
narrow that I can almost not go in, though the coachman push
me, and when I am in, and arrive after a awful shaking, I fear
I shall never come out. I like not the Drosciiken of London,
they are made only for the thin onea.
In the theater I am astounded. What a little building! It is
much littler than the Residenz-Theater in Miinchen. W under-
bar! But the Queen of ENGLAND Ls not often in London, so she
needs not a large court theater. And what a play! All the
actoresses have the ugliest clothes. Their faces are pretty, but
they are thin. The women in Berlin are beautyful and plump,
and they have the elegantest dresses, after the Berlin fashion,
which is the best in the world. I suppose the play is a comedy,
but I understand almost nothing. During the pauses I drink
beer in the Huffett, which is also small. All is very small, except
the price, and that is colossal. I pay ten Mark fifty for &Parket-
sitz. Even in Wien in the Burgtheater, in the first row, that
costs only six Mark. London is a jolly site too dear for me.
Obediently, LUDWIO.

(well played by Mr. G. DU MAUBIER), the tragedian, has the
attributes of Mi. Leiu-ille, who shares this line of business with
the j 11.1 M; i HIT, and is as quarrelsome as he is cowardly. Miss
Unecellicci, who was "trembling so much in her tights" when
Nicholas bade the company farewell, finds her equivalent in Miss
.11-11111,1 It,ina, capitally acted by Miss PATTIE BROWNE; and
so for the others.
Of course the fancy portraits are all highly coloured for stage
purposes , and the domestic life of the provincial actors, that is, of
the actors and actresses who used to be, before and "iu the
sixties," members, for years, of a country company, is more
mil-, pourtrayed by DICKENS than it could be, in this particular
piece, by our dramatist. But not a u lull of an unwholesome fla-
vour, not a spice ot lax morality, is there in it; herein differing irom
Mr. GEORGE MOORE'S £olaesque story of A Mummer's Wife.
And Mr. PINERO'S representation of a provmciaJ company as it
was when the Bath, Bristol, and Plymouth Theatres were in the
heyday of their existence, and wnen a visit to "The \\ells" was
quite a journey put of London, is as true as was Mr. t'incent
Crummles's description of their life when DICKENS made him say,
in taking leave ot Nicholas, " Vie were a very happy little com-
pany." They were; simple and happy. Did not Airs. SIDDONB,

the wing, while waiting to "go on," and bid her husband "give
me the dagger" '< \\ ell, that was the type of the provincial
actress, a genius it may be, but a thrifty housewife witnal, who,
in those days ot small salaries, had to consider the most trilling
matters of housekeeping.
Mr. SAM SOTHERN, as Captain de I'eenix, will forcibly remind
everyone of the "in the sixties" period of Lord Uandieary;
while Tom Wrench, who, as actor, is little more than a '• super,"
but who as author is destined to make a big success, must surely
have his original in the late TOM ROBERTSON, author of Caste.
And, indeed, has not the play written by Tom Wrench just the
idea, as far as one is permitted to know anything about it, of
Caste? Or perhaps the character may be a reminiscence of Mr.
PINERO'S own theatrical career.
The part ot the Vice-Chancellor is the piece's weakness. That
this relentless old father (of a very hackneyed theatrical type,
by the way) should suddenly relent on cateiimg sight of a pro-
perty sword and jewel used by EDMUND KEAN, is as ridiculous as
it is ineffective. V\e should like to forget this episode, and to
.see the part entirely re-written for Mr. BOUCICAULT, when the
present utterly inadequate motive would disappear. Miss IRENE
V'ANBRUOH, the heroine, is charming; Mr. FRED THORNE deserves
special mention as the waiter-greengrocer, as does also Mr. E.
M. ROBSON as the funny little low comedian.
Should the promise ot Trelawny prove as good as its performance,
then may the manager of the Court, Mr. ARTHUR CHUDLKIOH,
hum to himself the ancient refrain, adapted,
"And shall Trelmmy die? (bin)
No; not 1'or ninny hundred nights!

FROM the rising of the curtain even unto the final fall thereof,
Mr. PINERO'S Trelawny of the " Wells" is really amusing, because
it is capitally acted. Moreover, it is interesting, not so much
on account of the old, old story of the swain of comparatively
high degree, who falls in love with an actress, but by reason of
the peculiar costumes of the period that Mr. PINERO has boldly
chosen for his play. It is the time of crinolines, hair-nets, pork-

Mr. PINERO'S Trelawny of the. '' Wells" is really amusing, because
it is capitally acted. Moreover, it is interesting, not so much
on account of the old, old story of the swain of comparatively
high degree, who falls in love with an actress, but by reason of
the peculiar costumes of the period that Mr. PINERO has boldly
chosen for his play. It is the time of crinolines, hair-nets, pork-
pie hats, peg-top trousers, and Dundreary moustaches and weeping
whiskers. Nothing more hideous for the prettiest women, no-
thing more absurd for the men, than these fashions. On the
stage we have the reproductions of LEECH'S pictures, which
were exaggerations, but not to the extent of beinij broad cari-
catures. ^Somewhere in the Early Sixties," as the bill of the play
informs us, the dramatist has placed a set of characters who will
be recognised by readeis of DICKENS as belonging to the cele-
brated Crummies Provincial Company, and here transferred,
nominibui mutatis, from the Portsmouth to the Bagnipge-Wells
who plays the tragedy queens (vide "Phiz's" illustration in
the first volume of Nicholas Nickleby), while Ferdinand Gadd
(well played by Mr. G. DU MAUBIEB), the tragedian, has the
attributes of Mi. Lenoille, who shares this line of business with
the manager, and is as quarrelsome as he is cowardly. Mi,-,.,
Unecellicci, who was "trembling so much in her tights" when
Nicholas bade the company farewell, finds her equivalent in Miss
Avonia Vwm, capitally acted by Miss PATTIE BROWNE; and
so tor the others.
Of course the fancy portraits are all highly coloured for stage
purposes; and the domestic life of the provincial actors, that is, of
the actors and actresses who used to be, before and "in the
sixties," members, tor years, of a country company, is more
tully pourtrayed by DICKKNS than it could be, in this particular
piece, by our dramatist. But not a u lull of an unwholesome fla-
vour, not a spice of lax morality, is there in it; herein differing trom
Mr. UEORGE MOORE'S /.olaesque story of A Mummer's Wife.
And Mr. PINERO'S representation of a provincial company as it
was when the Bath, Bristol, and Plymouth Theatres were m the
heyday of their existence, and when a visit to "The \\ells" was
quite a journey put of London, is as true as was Mi. I'incent
Crummles's description of their life when DICKENS made him say,
in taking leave ot Nicholas, " \>e were a very happy little com-
pany." They were; simple and happy. Did not JVlrs. SIDDONS,
in the costume of Lady Macbeth, darn stockings, as she sat at
the wing, while waiting to "go on," and bid her husband "give
me the dagger " r* \>ell, that was the type of the provincial
actress, a genius it may be, but a thrifty housewife witnal, who,
in those days ot small salaries, had to consider the most trifling
matters of housekeeping.
Mr. SAM SOTHERN, as Captain de Fcenijc, will forcibly remind
everyone of the "in the sixties" period of Lord JJuitdieury;
while Tom Wrench, who, as actor, is little more than a ''super,"
but who as author is destined to make a big success, must surely
have his original in the late TOM ROBERTSON, author ot Caste.
And, indeed, has not the play written by Tom Wrench just the
idea, as far as one is permitted to know anything about it, of
Caste f Or perhaps the character may be a reminiscence of Mr.
PINEHO'S own theatrical career.
The part ot the Vice-Chancellor is the piece's weakness. That
this relentless old father (of a very hackneyed theatrical type,
by the way) should suddenly relent on catching sight ol a pro-
perty sword and jewel used by EDMUND KEAN, is as ridiculous as
it is ineffective. \Ve should like to forget this episode, and to
see the part entirely re-written for Mr. BOUCICAULT, when the
present utterly inadequate motive would disappear. Miss IRENE
V'ANBRUGH, the heroine, is charming; Mr. FRED THORNE deserves
special mention as the waiter-greengrocer, as does also Mr. E.
Al. ROBSON as the funny little low comedian.
Should the promise ot Trela/wny prove as good as its performance,
then may the manager of the Court, Mr. ARTHUR CHUDLEIGH,
hum to himself the ancient refrain, adapted,
"Aud shall Treiavaiy die? (iis)
No; not for muuy hundred nights'.
1 see 110 reason why!"
And so the Chudleigh ARTHUR may rest peaceably on the
Pinero ARTHUR'S well-dusted laurels. Prosit!
AN ACOUSTIC TERROR.
\Le Mi-Kestrel, a inusicul journal published in 1'aris, soys that a Roumanian
pianoforte-maker has invented a piano of such streuuosity, that its tones can
be heard at a distance of over six miles.]
THANK Heav'ns, it is seven miles and more
From London to Roumania,
Else there were painful times in store
For our unguarded crania!
Roumania, with the emphasis
On mania, now has gone sick, whence
All folks whose ear is not amiss
Have promptly fled in consequence.
If grand piano drowns big gun
In noisy strenuosity,
While Europe 's still at peace, we '11 shun
This musical monstrosity.

EXTUACTEl) FHUM THE UlAHV OF ToHV, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, February 8.
—A big House in the Commons for opening
of new Session. Much buzz and excite-
ment before SPEAKER took the Chair.
Thereafter a frost. Talk beforehand of
lively times; Government to be assaulted
on all sides. No harm likely to come of
thumping, however diligent, when delivered
through the many folds of Ministerial
majority. Still there would be a scrim-
mage; some pleasant rush of excitement.
Nothing of the sort; only series of long
speeches, rfchaiiffes of what had been said
day after day through the recess. Interest
early collapsed. Benches steadily emptied.
Those who had come to fight remained to
yawn. Impossible to keep thing going
even up to midnight. Before its stroke
boomed across the Thames (sympathetically
yawning at the moment), debate adjourned.
But, as some one has remarked, Thank
Heaven we have a House of Lords! To-
night that Chamber vindicated its ancient
renown. A scene of splendid dignity re-
dressed the balance established by dull
verbosity of the Commons. Incidentally
House summoned for opening of new
Session. Actually it gathered in un-
usual number to witness the elevation of
the LORD CHANCELLOR to the Earldom.
Yes, that gallant knight, Sir HARDINGE
STANLEY, Lord HALSBUKY, was now a
Viscount and Earl of Great Britain by the
name and title of Viscount TIVEBTON, Earl
of HALSBTTRY.
Opening scene discovered the belted
Earl (belt not drawn very tight) seated, in
abashed Woolsack. The MARKISS having
announced his new estate, the Earl, draw-
ing himself up to fullest height, walked
with stately step adown the gilded chamber.
Hesitated a biief moment as to what he
should do with his purse. Not an 01 dinary
thing, in which you might carry a sove-
reign or two, if you had them; but a big,
black, gold-embroidered bag, convenient
for country visits from Saturday-to-Mon-
day. At first seemed inclined to leave it
on the Woolsack. Glancing round, observ-
ing several Bishops in close contiguity,
concluded he would take purse with him.
So walked off with it.

Hereditary Grand Chamberlain, with can-

Earl of JERSEY acting as sponsors for

procession slowly wended its way to the
Throne. Arrived there, new Earl, audibly
prompted by Black Hod, plumped on knees
before empty Throne, on which for a mo-
ment he rested the long roll of parchment
containing patent of his new peerage.
Springing lightly to his feet, Viscount
TIVERTON, Earl of HALSBUHY, faced about
and, holding the scroll gingerly in both
arms as if he were conveying it to the baptis-
mal fount, procession moved towards the Bar.
The scarlet robes slashed with ermine de-
scending to his feet, the full-bottomed
wig enshrining a countenance of almost
motherly kindness, and the solicitude with
which he hold in outstretched arms the
long, lean body of the scroll, more than
ever suggestive of a christening.
Through the hushed silence was dis-
tinctly heard the shrill whisper of a breath-
lessly interested child looking on from
under the gallery: '' Mummy, do you think
it'll cry?'?
Procession, strolling in and out between
table and cross benches, reached bench
below gangway by Bar. Here the three
Earls, the new one in the middle, dropped
on to the seat, the LORD CHANCELLOR still
tenderly dandling in his aiins the patent
of his infant earldom. Situation seemed

suggestive of a cup of tea; perhaps, in the
Nurse JMsbury and the Infant Earldom.

A. No; but as some men have a horror

Q. And if a woman has lilerary tastes,
what would you advise?
A. That part of her reading should be
devoted to the fashion journals, and she
should not sacrifice her toilette to her
intellect.
Q. What is your opinion about latch-

A. That, from a man's point of view,
they are played out, and consequently
should be abandoned by man's would-be

Q. What do you think of glasses?
A. That, when necessary, they should
take the shape of a pince-nez, as it is more
becoming than spectacles.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTltACTEU FKOM THE DlAKY OK TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, Februiry 8.
—A big House in the Commons for opening
of new Session. Much buzz and excite-
ment before SPEAKER took the Chair.
Thereafter a frost. Talk beforehand of
lively times; Government to be assaulted
on all sides. No harm likely to come of
thumping, however diligent, when delivered
through the many folds of Minfsterial
majority. Still there would be a scrim-
mage; some pleasant rush of excitement.
Nothing of the sort; only series of long
speeches, rechauffes of what had been said
day after day through the recess. Interest
early collapsed. Benches steadily emptied.
Those who had come to fight remained to
yawn. Impossible to keep thing going
even up to midnight. Before its stroke
boomed across the Thames (sympathetically
yawning at the moment), debate adjourned.
But, as some one has remarked, Thank
Heaven we have a House of Lords! To-
night that Chamber vindicated its ancient
reuown. A scene of splendid dignity re-
dressed the balance established by dull
verbosity of the Commons. Incidentally
House summoned for opening of new
Session. Actually it gathered in un-
usual number to witness the elevation of
the LORD CHANCELLOR to the Earldom.
Yes, that gallant knight, Sir HARDINOE
STANLEY, Lord HALSBURY, was now a
Viscount and Earl of Great Britain by the
name and title of Viscount TrvERTON, Earl
of HALSBURY.
Opening scone discovered the belted
Earl (belt not drawn very tight) seated, in
abashed Woolsack. The MARKISS having
announced his new estate, the Earl, draw-
ing himself up to fullest height, walked
with stately step adown the gilded chamber.
Hesitated a biief moment as to what he
should do with his purse. Not an ordinary
thing, in which you might carry a sove-
reign or two, if you had them; but a big,
black, gold-embroidered bag, convenient
for country visits from Saturday-to-Mon-
day. At first seemed inclined to leave it
on the Woolsack. Glancing round, observ-
ing several Bishops in close contiguity,
concluded he would take purse with him.
So walked off with it.

After five minutes' absence returned,

spurred and sworded; Duke of NORFOLK
in Earl Marshal's robes; Lord ANCASTER

dlestick and pair of snuffers; Garter King-

over his back; Earl of COVENTRY and
Earl of JERSEY acting as sponsors for

procession slowly wended its way to the
Throne. Arrived there, new Earl, audibly
prompted by Black Hod, plumped on knees
before empty Throne, on which for a mo-
ment ho rested the long roll of parchment
containing patent of his new peerage.
Springing lightly to his feet, Viscount
TIVEHTON, Earl of HALSBUKY, faced about
and, holding the scroll gingerly in both
arms as if he were conveying it to the baptis-
mal fount, procession moved towards the Bar.
The scarlet robes slashed with ermine de-
scending to his feet, the full-bottomed
wig enshrining a countenance of almost
motherly kindness, and the solicitude with
which he held in outstretched arms the

Whilst the ladies sympathetically looked
on, wondering how far the tea would go

Business done.—New Session opened.
Thursday.—After closing time to-night,
WILFRID LAWSON went home a saddened
man. When SPEAKER took the Chair, things
looked particularly bright. Sir WILFRID'S
eye twinkled as, looking down the notices
of motion, he came on one by Government
Whip proposing to nominate the Kitchen
Committee.
"WALROND may propose," Sir WILFRID
contentedly murmured, "but LAWSON dis-
poses."
Debate on Address in full, if slow swing.
Nothing more certain than that it would
be carried over midnight. After that
solemn stroke had sounded, the strongest
Ministry of modern times could not carry
the simplest proposal if the most obscure
private Member objected. Sir WILFRID
was master of the situation. The Kitchen
Committee must either give pledge to
alter an anomalous and illegal condition of
things under which drink is sold at the
Lobby bars, the House being unlicensed,
or there should be no Kitchen Committee.
Hours slowly drifted by, weighted with
dreary drip of ceaseless talk. Distress in
Ireland; Slavery in Zanzibar; HOWARD
VINCENT on Foreign Tariffs; a dozen other
topics in reserve if these left any margin
of time before the fatal stroke of midnight.
Everything seemed safe. But WILFRID
LAWSON is too old a campaigner to leave
opening for accident. At a quarter to
twelve he mounted his watch-tower.

into stride on the drink question when
Closure was moved and game was up.
WILFRID LAWSON, with bowed head, heard
the Committee appointed.
It takes a long time to tell. But the
scene, dramatic finish to a dreary sitting,
flashed through in four minutes.

comedy," PRINCE ARTHUR called it, though
lie, not belonging to the domestic circle,
jlayed the brightest part. Dramatis per-
sonre: JOHN SHORT REDMOND, the true
patriot and only friend of Ireland; JOHN
CODLIN DILLON, claiming the same part:
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD struggling with thp
emotion of absorbing love, unbounded
affection for Home Rule, distressed at see-
ing its chances spoiled by petty jealousies
of two professional supporters; PRINCE
ARTHUR, the amused looker-on, with his
bag of salt, out of which he rubbed in re-
freshment for the wounds dealt each other
by the three friends to whom nothing was
common save passionate love for Ireland;
lastly, though his name was not on the
original bill, FLAVIN, MICHAEL JOSEPH,
Member for North Kerry, in business at
Tralee, descended in direct line from
FLAVIUB O'FLAVIN, King of Ireland.
When JOHN SHORT REDMOND had poured
cheap scorn on the political party that
ruined themselves for the sake of Home
Rule; when JOHN CODLIN DILLON had
threatened them with perpetual exile from
power unless they submissively followed
the chariot wheels of Home Rule; when
the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD had made patheti-
cally patient rejoinder; when PRINCE
ARTHUR rubbed in the last handful of salt,
English Liberals again to put Home Rule
first—then was heard from a modest back
bench the voice of the fiery FLAVIN.

the son of many kings.
It was the briefest, but, in immediate
effect, the most striking speech of the
evening.
Business done..—JOHN DILLON gives the
Liberal Party notice.
A SIMPLE CHILD OF THE GHETTO.
IN a bashful account of a brilliant career,
confided by Mr. ZANGWILL to The Bookman,
he mentions that he once edited a comic
paper, Arie.l. It is added, "One of the
Punch staff recently told him (Mr. ZANG-
WILL) that it was the only comic paper they
took seriously, and which they used to
read so as to avoid repeating its jokes."
"They were not alwavs successful," Mr.
ZANGWILL slyly remarks. It is a pretty
conceit, the Punch staff taking a comic
paper seriously, "and which" thev read so
as to avoid repeating its jokes. Mr. ZANG-
WILL, of course, does not mean, as might
be inferred, that the jokes were so bad that
to read them sufficed to ban repetition.
What he desires to convey is that this
serious comic paper monopolised the wit
and wisdom of the week, and that Mr.
Punch's young men, having their accus-
tomed space to fill, were in the habit of
sittine down in a row, reading Ariel, grate-
ful if it left anything, however immaterial,
for them to say. A funny picture; but the
funniest thing of all, that no one on the
Punrh staff ever heard of the serious comic
napor till its existence was brought to no-
fice by this modest passage from Mr. ZANG-
WILL'S autobiography.

'ARRY AMONG THE LONG TAILS.
HE MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A CotJKSING JUDGE, BUT THEY DO NOT "HIT IT
OFF," SOMEHOW.
ARS BREVIS!
THE ,Sr. James'* Gazette states that Mr.
ENGELHARDT, a Chicago painter, "throws
off marvellously clever paintings at the rate
of nine minutes for large canvasses, and
three minutes for small ones," working in
this way from ten to seventeen hours each
day. As a result of his brilliant example,
we may hope shortly to read in our papers
such paragraphs as the following :—
An interesting lecture on " Modern Art"
was delivered last week hy Professor
SIAPDASH, ~R.A. In the course of his re-
marks, the Professor took occasion to pro-
test against the excessive speed with which
seme painters complete their work. His
views on this point were somewhat reac-
tionary, and he caused a good deal of
dissent among his audience when he main-
tained that no artist should produce more
than a couple of hundred finished pictures
each week. As Professor SLAPDASH is one
of the Hanging Committee, it is possible
that his opinion is influenced by the fact
that rather more than two million canvasses
were sent in to Burlington House last year.
We hear that Signor PRESTISSIMO, the
celebrated Italian sculptor, is extremely
busy just now, and finds some difficulty in
•ions. He is not, however, a slow worker.
\Ve were fortunate enough to spend a
?ouple of hours in his studio the other day.
•luring which time Signor PRESTISSIMO com-
•-.leted six life-size statues, four beautifully-
'nodelled groups, seven designs for friezes,
ind twenty-one small busts. But his ex-
perience is that the sculptor who works at
this rate is ill-advised if he attempts to
keep it up for more than fifteen or sixteen
hours each day. General attention will hi'
directed to his colossal figure of " Hercules,''
which is shortly to be exhibited, as it is
understood that Signor PRESTISSIMO spent
no less than twenty minutes in perfecting it.
The state of the literary market is dull
at present, the number of new books pub-
lished last week being only one hundred
and forty thousand. Probably there will
,be no great stir of activity until the
Autumn publishing season comes round
again. By far the most noticeable volume
of the past week was Tlie Grmrth of Man-
kind, a comprehensive work in ten volumes.
Such a work comes as a timely reproach to
the facile scribblers of the present day, who
may affect to despise the author of this
masterpiece, because it absorbed his full
industry for no less than a month. But the
careful student of Tlie Growth nf Mankind
will recognise with delight the polished
knowledge which characterise it, and will
lot deem the month misspent, even though
the whole of it was devoted to the composi-
tion of this one masterpiece.
Does the Poet-laureate earn his official
income p That question is often asked by
the public, and it is satisfactory to be able
to answer in the affirmative. On Monday
of last week, for instance, the Poet-laureate
wrote four ballads, of about five hundred
lines each. Tuesday and Wednesday he
devoted to the composition of an epic
poem in ten cantos. On Thursday he pro-
duced a translation of the Iliad, on Fnday
in original blank-verse tragedy. Saturday
he regards as a holiday, and he wrote
nothing on that day beyond a Nuptial Ode
if a few hundred lines. Of course, many
vounger bards can finish their songs at a
'Deed far greater, but for a middle-aged
•nan, the above seems to us to be a very
fair week's work.
It is said that the new "Instantaneous
literary Supply Company" will be started
lext month. Commodious premises in
Oxford Street have been secured, and the
company will be prepared to prepare any
kind of literature for their customers
'while they wait." A talented staff has
been engaged, who will be able to produce
literature of all kinds at the maximum
speed and the minimum price.
Mr SEMTBREVE, the eminent composer,
isks us to state that he resents being un-
duly hurried with his work. He wishes
Festival Committees to understand that he
sannot provide a new oratorio unless at
'.east two days' notice is given.
OF a popular actress it was recently said,
''she acts like a charm." Yes; but what
sort of "charm "? and then, what kind of
effect has that "charm "? Circe exercised
her charms on Ulysses' friends.

AIRS RESUMPTIVE.
THE PLAINT OF DYING HUMOUR.
(After C. S. C.)
[" It is reported that Sir I.K« is MORRIS " (M.A.,
Author of The Epic of Hades, Songt TJnxvng, Songs
without Notes, &c., retired candidate for Carmarthen
Boroughs, and J.P.) "has complained that laughter
is dying out."—Daily Paper.]
I KNOW not what the cause should be
That Humour melts my heart no more;
That nothing now induces me
To roar.
In days of old my waistcoat heaved
Conjointly with my heaving chest
As soon as ever I perceived
A jest;
The simple pun, the patent wheeze,
Would take me in the diaphragm;
But now I hardly care for these
A cent.
I almost fear—I know not why—
That Laughter's fount has been misl.iid;
I could not giggle, not if I
Was paid.
And yet my health is very fair;
I harbour no religious doubts;
And am but sixty-four or there-
-abouts.
Time was when I and others laughed;
When many an apoplectic fit
Was traced directly to a ihaft
Of wit;
For such would find the harness-joint,
And pierce the vulnerable spot,
Whether they chanced to have a point
Or not.
I Ve been, myself, severely blamed
For causing careless men to choke,
Though (wittingly) I never framed
A joke.
You know the "Welsh Harp," Hendon
way?
Well, I had one—it came from Wales;
On this it was my pride to play
The scales.
Occasionally I would strike
Such notes as never yet were heard;
Or even sing without them, like
A bird.
I sang for joy with either ling;
I draw applause from youngish maids;
And had a small success among
The shades.
And once, when I was straitly pressed
To go and stand for Parliament,
I ceased my ;inging (by request)
And went.
I went and canvassed. Celti-- hre
Flamed in my eye and scorched the lid;
And when they asked me to retire,
I did.
I settled down again and played
The same old harp with all my might;
And subsequently I was made
A knight.
But when the ever-verdant bays
Alighted on another's head,
Somehow I deemed that Humour's days
Were dead.
And yet, who knows? Some Orpheus now
May strike his rib-compelling lyre

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
LIKE an earlier and even more distinguished excursionist, Mr.
CON AN DOYI.K did not "go down into Egypt" for nothing. He
brought back with him materials for a story, published by SMITH,
ELDER, under the title The Tragedy of the Korosko. The mate-
rials are exceedingly simple. A party of COOK'S tourists set
forth on the familiar journey up the Nile. They are seized by a
party of Dervishes, carried off into captivity, and rescued by a
detachment of the Indian Camel Corps. Out of these somewhat
commonplace materials, Mr. DOYLE has fashioned a story of
breathless interest, lightened by many touches of character, and
framed in the carefully-studied atmosphere of the Nubian desert.
The story will not rank among his supremest efforts. But it is
full of life and colour, a pleasant companion for a restful hour.
It is an exceedingly difficult task to write a volume chiefly
composed of the sayings of children. Beyond the fond family
circle a little of this kind of wit and wisdom goes a long way.
In The Professor's Children (LONGMANS), Miss E. H. FOWLER has,
my Baronite tells me, adventured this task and has accomplished
it. The dainty book is a close sympathetic study of the child-
mind, and the narrative is full of those quaint fancies which
find birth in its virgin soil. THE BARON :>E B.-W.
"MUCH ADO " AT THE ST. JAMES'S.
As Mr. LOWELL observed, or quoted,
"The man who never makes a mistake
will never make anything," and on this
ground a pro/'os of the recent production of
Much Ado at the St. James's Theatre, I
venture to think that Mr. GEORGE ALEX-
ANDER, as PAT MULLIGAN put it, "has a
greater future before him than ever he had
behind him." Could scenery, for the most
part excellent, and sumptuous costumes of
artistic design, contribute more than their
fair share towards making a success, then,
for what is lacking in the merits both of
stage management and of acting, full
compensation would have been made in
this revival, which cannot fail to be com-
pared by playgoers, those uncompromis-
ing "old hands,' with a representation of the
same play, not so very long ago, at another
theatre. Such comparisons are, as we are
aware, "oderous," and to be altogether
avoided. That Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER
looks the Benedick, "a young Lord of
Padua," would be undeniable, if that uncon-
firmed bachelor were of the same age, or even
younger than that other "young Lord of
Padua," Signor Claudio, whom he disdain-
fully terms "boy," just as do those two
reverend seniors, Leonato, the father, and
Antonio, uncle of Hero. Benedick, it may
be fairly assumed, is older than the two
Princes, Don Pedro and Don John, and,
the link between the elders and the youths;
he is Benedick in the very prime of his
manhood, and fully eight years older
than Beatrice, who had resolved to die an
old maid unless she, like Benedick, should
live to be married. In point of age, Beatrice
is to Hero, as Benedick to Claudio. Beatrice is
not a Miss Hoyden, nor is Benedick a " touch-
and-go" Charles Harcourt; Miss JULIA
NEILSON would be quite unfitted for Miss
Hoyden, while Mr. ALEXANDER carries in
his face just so much of cynical expression
as would make the character of the careless
young roysterer quite unsuitable to him,
though it ought to be a natural gift on

"I am trusted with a muzzle. . . If I had my
which he should have traded when con"
templating the part of Benedick. With
another two months' careful study and
intelligent rehearsal, Mr. ALEXANDER
might have given us an ideal Benedick, and
a perfectly stage-managed representation
of the play, which, as it is, seems to
justify its title of Much Ado about Nothing.
When Mr. ALEXANDER comes to the
serious dramatic situation where he breaks
with the Prince and challenges Claudio,
how excellent he is! He would have done
well had he turned back and studied the
character from this one standpoint. The
two scenes in the garden, where, first,
Benedick overhears Don Pedro, Claudio and
Leonato talking about the love of Beatrice
for him, and, secondly, where Beatrice
(apparently in a sort of bathing costume)
overhears the discourse of Hero and Mar-
garet about the love of Benedick for her,
show such a lack of resourceful stage
management as brings out all the glaring
improbabilities of the situations, and thus
reduces comedy to mere farce. The pre-
sent arrangement may be supported by
every sort of old-fashioned precedent and
stage tradition, but Mr. ALEXANDER would
have done better had he determined to
"reform it altogether."
Mr. FRED TERRY is a merry Don Pedro,
with just such princely dignity as is suffi-
cient to mark the distinction of his rank.
But how loud the three laugh and talk when

There is something particularly uncanny

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
LIKE an earlier and even more distinguished excursionist, Mr.
CONAN DOYI.K did not "go down into Egypt" for nothing. He
brought back with him materials for a story, published by SMITH,
ELDER, under the title The Tragedy of the Korosko. The mate-
rials are exceedingly simple. A party of COOK'S tourists set
forth on the familiar journey up the Nile. They are seized by a
party of Dervishes, carried off into captivity, and rescued by a
detachment of the Indian Camel Corps. Out of these somewhat
commonplace materials, Mr. DOVLE has fashioned a story of
breathless interest, lightened by many touches of character, and
framed in the carefully-studied atmosphere of the Nubian desert.
The story will not rank among his supremest efforts. But it is
full of life and colour, a pleasant companion for a restful hour.
It is an exceedingly difficult task to write a volume chiefly
composed of the sayings of children. Beyond the fond family
circle a little of this kind of wit and wisdom goes a long way.
In The Professor's Children (LONGMANS), Miss E. H. FOWLER has,
my Baronite tells me, adventured this task and has accomplished
it. The dainty book is a close sympathetic study of the child-
mind, and the narrative is full of those quaint fancies which
find birth in its virgin soil. THE BARON :IE B.-W.
"MUCH ADO " AT THE ST. JAMES'S.
As Mr. LOWELL observed, or quoted,
'' The man who never makes a mistake
will never make anything," and on this
ground a pro/'os of the recent production of
Much Ado at the St. James's Theatre, I
venture to think that Mr. GEORGE ALEX-
ANDER, as PAT MULLIGAN put it, "has a
greater future before him than ever he had
behind him." Could scenery, for the most
part excellent, and sumptuous costumes of
artistic design, contribute more than their
fair share towards making a success, then,
for what is lacking in the merits both of
stage management and of acting, full
compensation would have been made in
this revival, which cannot fail to be com-
pared by playgoers, those uncompromis-
ing "old hands,' with a representation of the
same play, not so very long ago, at another

"MUMMY DEAR, CAN'T WE PLAY AND BE JOLLY TOGETHER? You ARE so—so DREADFULLY QROWN-UP!"
LUDWIG IN LONDON.
PICCALILLI.
HONOVKED MISTER,—In Berlin the stranger visits first the
remarkablest street called Die Linden, or more solemnly Untei
den Linden, under the limes. Therefore in visiting London's
Sehenswiirdigknifn I go first to piccalilli—ah no, you write the
names of streets and places with a big letter—Piccalilli, the
Limes of London. I remember the name because I have seen it
on a bottle of the english "Piccalilli Pickles." When I lem
a strange language I notice and remember everything.
I go from the boardinghouse near the Naturalhistory Museum,
which the young barrister now says was made in Germany. 1
think that this is false, falsch, but perhaps he means that the
architekt was a German, which is very probable as the building
ia like u german one. Besides the german architekts are the
best in the world. I believe that ore of them at the present
time restores and improves the Parthenon in Athen. But I can
not understand why a german architekt should make a building
which looks like Stilton cheese. From there I go in the omnibus
to Heidpark Corner.
The entrance of your park is like the Brandenburger Thor in
Berlin, but not so large and not so handsome. In the park there
is no beautyful, wide alley like the Charlottenburger Cnaussee in
our Animnlgarden, and what is still badder—ah no, more bad—
one i-in not go in the park in a omnibus, or even in a "keb.
Of course thero are no tramways, because you have them iiot in
London. I walk not willing, so till now I see not the Heidpark.
As regards Piccalilli, I like not the street at all. Ah, Mister
Punch, you should see our Limes in Berlin! I mean not the
limetrees, which are an awful scrubby lot of trees. I mran the
street, which is the beautyfulest street in Berlin, and in the
world. It n quite straight, it is quite flat, and it is more than
not flat, it is about sixty foot wide, it is not even the same wideth
all along, and the houses only on one side are all different.
Abscheulich!
There is only one thing in it which pleases me, and that is
what I see at first when I step out of the omnibus. It is the
Vildsaule, picturecolumn—that is, statue—of the Duke of \\"EL-
LINGTOWN, who was the general of the english army commanded
by Feldherr VON BLUCHER when the latter conquered NAPOLEON.
I see immediately that it is a awfully fine statue, and afterwards
I discover the reason. It was made by a German. Natiirlich!
The german artists are the best in the world. I know not rf you
have any good carvers in England, but of course they are not so
clever. It pleases me that the Englishmen must employ not only
german waiters, but also german carvers. "DeutsMand,
Deutichland, iibtr alles!"
As I speak of statues, I may say I have seen the statue of
BOADICEA, the first Queen of England. I admired that statue,
and at first I thought it was also made by a German, because it
is so beautyful and warlike. The young barrister admires it not.
He says it is "a rotten thing made of plaster." If it is made
only of plaster of course it must soon rot. In Berlin all the
statues are made of marble or bronze.
I walk a little along Piccalilli. I am quite astounded that I see
not there, or in any street, even one lieutenant. In Berlin, as
hi every german town, one sees officers everywhere. I know that
the ridiculous english army is very little, and that there are now
so many generals with the soldiers in India that there can be no
more english generals anywhere else, but I hp.d thought I should
see leastways lieutenants in London. But no. The young bar-
rister says "All those Johnnys go about in Mufftea." I can not
find this word in my dictionary, so it must be a town or province
somewhere, perhaps in India, where the tea grows. But even
if all the lieutenants called JOHNNY are travelling in the province
of Mufftea, where are the lieutenants not called JOHNNY P I
180 foot wide. Praehtvoll! Your Piccalilli is not straight, it is
know not. Obediently, LCDWIO.

Master MILLAIS was admitted student of

And how interesting in this collection
are the gradual upward steps of an Art
Pilgrim's Progress. Here is seen how he
was allured on the way by a Pre-Raphaelite
Temptress, from whose fascinations escap-
ing, he became stronger than ever, knowing
thenceforth what to avoid. Who could be-
lieve the " Cymon and Iphigenia" of 1848
to be by the same aand that gave us
"Stella" twenty years afterwards. Even
two years made a vast 'lifference, witness
the " Conclusion of Peace" (1856), with its
capillary aureole of ripe corn, and arms and
hands belonging to anybody and every-
body, in the picture; ilso the now famous
"Vale of East" (1858). Yet with all his
masculinity, what sentimental book-of-
beauty kind of lady in fancy-dress armour
is his "Joan of Arc" (186-5). But how
grand, how life-like, are most of his por-
traits! His ".Sir Henry Thompson," his
"Sir Richard Quain," his " Tennyson," his
"Mrs. Beddington," unJ "Mrs. Bischoffs-
htim," and his three lovely ladies at cards
waiting for "a fourth" to be partner to
one of them. Then there 's "Master Bub-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
In course of disputation somebody threw
out suggestion that the real criminal is Lord
CROSS. In 1889. when he was at India
Office, he officially approved project for
opening a direct route to Chitral from the
Peshawur frontier. Hounds away on this
new trail with yelp of ecstatic delight. Not
many Members of present House have per-
sonal recollection of GRAND CROSS whilst
he was yet •with us. From time to time,
decessor responsible for a feckless policy, a
futile war. It was all GRAND CROSS.
Business done,—Vote of Censure on the
Government in respect of Chitral business
shows considerable falling off in normal
majority. For the amendment 208, against
311. Majority dropped nearly forty.
"What do you think of that, TOBY,"
PRINCE ARTHUR said, a little nervously,
as wo walked home together.

CHATTING WITH THE DECEASED!
(Scene jrom the Wettmimtcr Veriton of" The Cat and the'Cherub.")
The learned Doctor "Wee-To contrives to give it an appearance of life while the " street-god"

even now, his presence in the Peers'
Gallery elevates and inspires thp Commons.
Members who do not recognise him by
name look up and feel comforted and
strengthened by contemplation of his su-
premely well-informed countenance.
A.9 SARK says, "No moital could be so
wise as GRAND CROSS looks."
Of late years has fallen out of front
rank of fighting politicians; believe
he is something in present Ministry.
Bet you a Dod not one out of ten
men moderately well up in public
affairs could name his office. Now, sud-
denly, out of this dull chaos of talk his
name is heard again. He is the culprit.
The loss of treasure, the check to Bntish
prestige, the mourning in a multitude of
once happy households, all traceable to
him.
Impossible to say which more de-
lighted at this unexpected turn, HENRY
FOWLER or GEORGE HAMILTON. With
difficulty they restrain impulse to fling
themselves across table to meet in friendly
"Well, since you ask me, I should say it
is a friendly verdict of 'Not guilty, but for
goodness' sake don't do it any more.'"
House of Lords, Thursday.—Every one
glad to see the MAKKISB in his place to-
night. Looks as if he had never brought
down the entrance gate of his park as if it
were the doors of the gate of the city of
Gaza, and so passed on,
Not in entire forgctfulness,
And not in utter nnkedness;
But, trailing clouds of brickdust, do we come
To Hatfield, which is our home.
The Member for Sark insists that
there is more in the matter than
meets the eye. What the curious story
is meant to convey is a commentary
on present situation in the Cabinet. In
debate on Address, the MARKISS made
some deprecatory remarks about people
who want to fight everybody and take
everything. This, kind friends insist, was
a sly hit at his dearly-beloved colleague,
the COLONIAL SECRETARY. DON JOSE not

any one assails him... Determined to read
SARK has heard) he on Tuesday night man-
aged to disguise himself in coachman's uni-
form, took the reins and coachman's seat,
and drove the unsuspecting MARKISS home-
ward. Arrived at the gateway, he, by deft
touch of whip and rein, succeeded in leav-
ing the MARKISS and the hinder portion of
the carriage stuck in the gateway, whilst
he drove on unhurt and triumphant.
"A very remarkable story," I said, du-
biously. "What does it perpend?"
"Which thing is an allegory," said SARK,
impatiently. "Don't you see it was in-
tended to convey to MARKISS a gentle
intimation that if, in driving the Unionist
coach, he flattered himself ue could gain
the whip-hand of DON JOSE, he would soon
find the coach broken up, himself left be-
hind with the wreck, whilst DON JOSE gaily
drove off, unhampered and unhurt."
"Ah ! I see," I said. Not sure that I do,
but it's no use arguing with SARK.
Business dnne.—In Commons, JOHN DIL-
LON'S amendment to Address demanding
endowment of Roman Catholic University
in Ireland, negatived. Almost brought
tears to the eyes to observe the anxiety in
various quarters on both sides of House to
-see the proposal carried into effect. PRINCK
ARTHUR, JOHN MORLEY, CARSON, Q.C.,
and. COURTNEY (in excellent speech) from
various points of view supported the amend-
ment. Only they united in beseeching
DIT.LOX to withdraw it.
"Some other time," they said, mopping
damp eyes. "Some other time."
Friday night.—Irish Members renewed
their attack on War Office in matter of
frozen meat. Since Session opened their
nightly habit has been to come down se-
rreting about their persons joints of frozen
meat, which they shy nt POWELL WILLIAMS
on Treasury Bench. (This of course in Par-
liamentary sense.) Has borne the ordeal
with exemplary patience. But the Finan-
cial Secretary will turn at last. To-night
being struck in the abdomen with a chunk
of Australian mutton flung by Captain
DONELAN, he lifted up his voice in loud
lamentation.
"I begin to think," he said, ducking his
head as half a sirloin of American beef came
his way, "that the Financial Secretary to
the War Office ought to be a butcher."
Something in the idea. A monotony
about the Treasury Bench with its row of
gentlemen in morning dress. POWELL
WILLIAMS with his coat off. his sleeves
turned up displaying hn manly forearm, a
blue apron turned back over his sturdy
knees, a steel at his belted waist, and a
knife in his greasy hand, would make a
picturesque adjunct to the comeliness of
HER MAJESTY'S Ministry.
Business done.—Address agreed to.

But even Teutons recognise
The genial fun of our Assize 1
This is the way that we commence :—
We first assume the prisoner's guilt
Until he prove his innocence
Up to—or glightly past—the hilt;
A single alibi should do,
But custom rather leans to two.
And though the prosecution fail,
We have the option, just the same,
Of clapping people into gaol
To keep our honour free from shame;
We always do like this, you know,
In dealing with a bordereau.
French leave (a liberal kind of scope)
To gallant witnesses we grant,
To ventilate the loyal hope
That France may still remain extant;
The Bench will also let the crowd
Say " Good old Army!" quite aloud I
Facing, in fact, a martial camp,
No learned counsel dares collide
With men of military stamp
Appearing on the judge's side;
If they prefer to speak, they may;
If not, they look the other way.
And when the jury, men of sens',
And loth to find an early tomb,
Return with swift incontinence
To tell the predetermined doom—
Oh! then the sacred courts become
A blessed pandemonium!
Liberty Hall we name the spot!
There stands Fraternity in arms;
There Justice deals the Equal lot;
There Freedom spreads her ample
charms:
There men may gather at a glance
The Triple Motto made in France!
What though perfidious Albion mock
The laws of our enlightened land?
Sons of a brutal Saxon stock,
What can they ever understand?
Give us your Celt, your Dr. TANNER,
He has the true Parisian manner!
"ACCORDING TO ST. KRUGER."
ANT judge giving independent decision
will be prosecuted with the utmost rigour
of the—Volksraad (vice Law resigned).
The Volksraad is supreme, i.e., as long as
it acts in accordance with my wishes.
Any judge venturing to differ from MB
will be summarily dismissed.
No verdict ever to be allowed in favour of
an Outlander.
Chief Justice KOTZE, in consideration of
his long and meritorious services, to be

AN OARSMAN'S DIARY.
Monday.—The Sportsman says: "The
Eight shows considerable improvement,
JACKSON, the new heavy-weight, having
come on very much during the past week.
The order of the crew may now be taken as
definitely settled." Good! Cut out ex-
tract and send it home. Am tubbed in the
afternoon. Coach says my beginning is
much better, but must try to swing more.
Row a full course in the Eight. My slide
comes off in the first minute, and we have
to go back to the start. President much
annoyed. Says so. I said I had tried my
best to keep slide on. He says I must
better my best. No further mishaps. Get
pumped before we 've gone half-way.
Coach shouts, "More work, six." Just
get to the finish. Dead tired paddling
home. Dinner. Bed at 9.30.
Tuesday.— Very stiff this morning.
More tubbing, with elaborate explanations
of proper method of working. Short course
in the Eight. Stroke keeps splashing me
at every stroke. Tell him so afterwards
jocularly. He says, "How can I clear the
water if you ram your hands down into the
bottom of the boat?" He never can see a
joke. Coach says he thinks I 'm improving
slowly—which isn't too cheerful. Have got
two raw places on hands and my knees are
badly chapped. President asks me why on
earth I can't use those legs of mine better?
No reply ready, so say nothing, but smile.
He doesn't smile. Dull dog.
Wednesday.—President and coach whis-
per together before the Eight starts. Omi-
nous. Hear rumour that OWEN may be

(as Hamlet) to Junes (as diaries tJie Second). ""NoKMOus AMOUNT OF TASTS
DISPLAYED HERE To-NIOHT!"
does come they can't mean to row him at
No. 6. He's too light for that. Another
full course, in last minute of which, just as
stroke begins to spurt, I catch a crab and
bring the row to a premature end. Every-
body angry, instead of being thankful at
not having had to row on. My rigger
badly twisted. Boat rolls awfully as we
paddle home. President furious, coach
gloomy. They whisper again together
after the Eight comes in. Don't like it a
bit.
Thursday.—Letter from home begging
me not to overdo it. On arriving at river
find OWEN there. Evident constraint in
his greeting. Eight goes out for short
paddle. On returning, President says he
to try OWEN. Eight goes out again with
OWEN at No. 6. He 's rowing atrociously,
but coach has nothing but praise for him.
There 's no fairness in the world.
Friday.—Letter from President saying
he has had to make up his mind to row
OWEN instead of me. Thanks me for trying
so hard, and adds that he 's sorry he 's had
to relieve me of my seat, but his duty com-
pelled him. Write home saying I've re-
solved to take their advice. Shall give up
rowing and take to golf.
Saturday.—The Field says: "The sub-
stitution of OWEN for JACKSON has already
caused a great improvement." Wish I
knew who wrote that rubbish. I think
crew are going as badly as possible. No
sent for. Try not to believe it. If OWEN
matter. A time will come.

Not SHAKSPEARE himself could hare penned a gem so perfect as
the "Ballade of Blackbeetles" contained in this volume. The
appearance of Chirpings and Twitterings will mark the beginning

The days of Grub Street are gone for good. It is an open
secret that the majority of our authors nowadays are simply
rolling in wealth. As an instance, we may mention that the
enterprising proprietor of the Family Coalscuttle is paying Miss
SKRIBLER no less than half-a-guinea for the short glories (each
amounting only to about four thousand words) which she is con-
tributing to that popular magazine. Miss SKRIBLER has just
finished a sketch, based on her own experience, of the require-
ments of a nursery governess. Extending only to three or four
lines, it is a masterpiece of concentrated pathos, and doubtless
will obtain for her the position she covets. We understand that,
after much consideration, she has decided to grant the privilege
of publishing this gem to the Times, and it may be looked for in
the advertisement columns of that journal in the course of next
week.
It will interest all readers of Mr. BROWN'S novels to learn that
this favourite author will spend next Saturday to Monday at
Gravesend. As the scene of his next romance is laid there, he

rolling in wealth. As an instance, we may mention that the
enterprising proprietor of the Family Coalscuttle is paying Miss
SKRIBLER no less than half-a-guinea for the short stories (each
amounting only to about four thousand words) which she is con-
tributing to that popular magazine. Miss SKRIBLER has just
finished a sketch, based on her own experience, of the require-
ments of n nursery governess. Extending only to three or four
lines, it is a masterpiece of concentrated pathos, and doubtless
will obtain for her the position she covets. We understand that,
after much consideration, she has decided to grant the privilege
of publishing this gem to the Times, and it may be looked for in
the advertisement columns of that journal in the course of next
week.
It will interest all readers of Mr. BROWN'S novels to learn that
this favourite author will spend next Saturday to Monday at
Gravesend. As the scene or his next romance is laid there, he
colour " by a visit to the neighbourhood. It will be remembered
that he has already immortalised Exmoor and the Doone valley
by his last novel. It is stated that some obscure author of the
name of BLACKMORE once wrote a tale or a poem dealing with
the same locality.
What a pleasant relief it is to turn from the morbid sentiment
of the older poets to brief, brisk ballads of noble deeds! Such
are to be found in the magnificent and unrivalled pages ot
Mainly Midshipmen, Mr. OLDBAH'S latest volume. They will
surely stir the blood and quicken the pulse of every true and
patriotic Englishman. Nothing could be more convincing than
the "Ballad of the Imperence," which describes how a British
fishing-boat fought and captured a fleet of the Spanish and
French navies, consisting of sixty-two men-of-war. How feeble
a poem seems TENNYSON'S Revenge by the side of this consummate
masterpiece I

THE REVIEWS OF EEVIEWEES.1
IN the current number of the Author,
Sir WALTER BESANT expresses a fear that
''the reputation of the reviewer and the
influence of the review" are likely "to
decay and die altogether." That this
calamity may be averted, Mr. Punch has
selected a few of the best models for the
benefit of the budding critic, who cannot
do better than follow one or other of these
examples. He has, let us suppose, a novel
entitled Cabbage and Caterpillar before
him for judgment; how is he to word In.
opinion of it f If his notice is to appear in
an old-fashioned journal, he may prefer the
lished reputation, and is not difficult to
write. Ex.gr.: —
"AHISTOTLB lays down, we believe, the
| remarkably sound principle that the end of
a volume should invariably be placed after
the beginning, and it is noteworthy that
PLATO, by offering no confutation of this
theory, tacitly admits its truth. With the
help of this profound dictum, therefore, we
turn to examine the latest ephemeral pro-
duction of the moment, a novel with the
title of Cabbage and Caterpillar. Oene-
tivut qualitatii cum epitheto, as VERGIL so
touchingly remarks, and we discern the
applicability of the line to the character of
John. James Jones, who figures as the hero
conforms to the dramatic unities of time
and place is another matter. But while
there is much that is weak, there is also
much that is strong in this volume; and
while we regret that its author has not
seen fit to exercise his talent upon a more
suitable theme, we can state with equal con-
fidence that no more appropriate subject
could possibly have been found. In short,
cur verdict may be tersely summed up in
that admirable epigram of MOLIEKB'S, 'A vez-
vovs le crayon? Non, mais j'ai le pa-
pier.'"
This kind of review impresses your
readers, and can hurt nobody's feelings.
This last point should always be remembered
by the youthful critic. Never "slate" a
book, for its writer may one day review a
volume of your own. When in doubt,
keep it vague. At times, however, you
may venture upon eulogy. This is best
done in a literary weekly, when you can
employ the Cultured Style. It is a little
more difficult to manage than the Pom-
pous, but you can win a reputation by it
tor '' rare distinction in criticism." A spe-
cimen is appended.
"'Twere scarce of a need obtrudent to
pass pat judgment on a work so masterful,
so purely rare, as Cabbage and Caterpillar.
Fain would the critic allow the true dis-
ciple to taste a sweet delight, to purchase
it hereafter, mere and unkempt, t mm the
second-hand book-stall; so, surely, his the
greater rapture. Yet, if 'tis needful to
.•hire abroad its fame, rather than, as were
meet, to hide it from the public gross and
gluttonous, the task is lightly accom-
plished. To say that it is magnificent were
to insult it strangely, so far its beauties do
transcend all modes of speech. Herein you
shall find wit, herein pathos, herein all else
that makes towards perfection. Gracious
and fair as some June blossom is the style;
the beautiful secret of beautiful prose irks
not, elusive, the author of Cabbage and
Caterpillar. To say more were something
otiose, to hint less were flatly wrong."
When you have written sufficient notices
in this style, you will collect them and re-
publish them in volume form, after which
your fame as a critic will rapidly increase.
Ihe Egotistic Style is very popular just
now, and may be safely recommended. Its
special advantage is that it relieves you
from the troublesome necessity of reading
a single page of the volume. Ex. gr.:—
"I picked up Cabbage and Caterpillar
directly after lunch yesterday; and I may a&
well mention that my fare had consisted of
chops, a pint of lager beer, and cheese.
Isn't it strange how one has chops for
lunch nine days out of ten? Gone are the
old times, when one gladly added raspberry
puffs, Turkish delight and sherbet to the
meal. I wonder, dear reader, whether, like
myself, you always preferred pink sherbet
to the ordinary kind:- I sigh still when I
see it in the confectioners' shops, so distant
and dim are the days becoming when I,
too, quaffed pink sherbet. Well, age has
its consolations; best of all, it brings us
tobacco, that soothing gift of the gods.
Personally, I incline to the cigarette rather
than to pipe or cigar; the taste for things
Turkish lingers in me still, it seems. So,
as I was saying, I sat down in my second-
best arm-chair, lit a cigarette, and picked
up Cabbage and Caterpillar. Unfortu-
nately, my space is now exhausted, so I
can only add that it is a novel of one
volume, containing 312 pages, and is bound
Pompous Style. This has a long-estab-
in green cloth."

Who 'i Who ? is an annual that, like the poor, we seem to have

how he amuses himself in leisure moments, and where he lives.
Its nearly 7,000 biographies are supplemented by much useful

she has, what is not a common virtue among women who write
books, an excellent literary style. She can draw a character, real
live man, boy or girl, in a few strokes, is inventive of plot and
commonly called Bill, are (especially BUT) creations that remind
one pleasantly of THACKERAY.
"I am emphatically of opinion," wrote that thorough Briton,
JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS, in his outspoken Thoughts on our Art of
To-day, " that the best Art of modern times is as good as any of
its kind that has gone before, and furthermore that the best Art
in England can hold its own against the world."

will be heartily welcomed by all readers as at once interesting and

Bravo, Miss BRADDON! Most interesting is your latest novel,
Rough Justice (SiMPKlN & Co.), and unsatisfactory in one point
only, and that no unimportant one, seeing that, just when your
million readers are expecting the condign punishment of the real
culprit, who is an out-and-out villain, you quietly let the wretch
go free. There may be, however, a cynicism underlying this
apparently inexplicable tenderness, as you gire him in marriage
to a lady of title with money, who is as devoted to him as was Mrs.
Micawber to her spouse, and so, when this rascally husband beco naes
a Member of Parliament, she will watch him from the Ladies'
Gallery, will meet him at tea on the Terrace, wait for him to go
home to dinner, and, in short, never lose sight of him for an
instant. So the Baron is of opinion that, you, my dear Miss
BRADDON, as the authoress of this scoundrel's being, couldn't
have done better for him had you hauled him up before judge and
jury, and treated him to a public execution, or had you started
for Klondyke, and got him murdered en toiite.

only, and that no unimportant one, seeing that, just when your
million readers are expecting the condign punishment of the real
culprit, who is an out-and-out villain, you quietly let the wretch
go free. There may be, however, a cynicism underlying this
apparently inexplicable tenderness, as you giee him in marriage
to a lady of title with money, who is as devoted to him as was Mrs.
Micawber to her spouse, and so, when this rascally husband beco -nes
a Member of Parliament, she will watch him from the Ladies'
Gallery, will meet him at tea on the Terrace, wait for him to go
home to dinner, and, in short, never lose sight of him for an
instant. So the Baron is of opinion that, you, my dear Miss
BRADDON, as the authoress of this scoundrel's being, couldn't
have done better for him had you hauled him up before judge and
jury, and treated him to a public execution, or had you started
him for Elondyke, and got him murdered en route.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Who'» Who ? is an annual that, like the poor, we seem to have
always had with us. The edition just out (ADAM & CHARLES
BLACK) is, in fact, its fiftieth year. Last year, by the original
and well-directed energy of a new editor, Mr. DOUGLAS SLADEN,
it was transformed into one of the livest serials of the kind. It
is, in truth, so complete as to enable my Baronite to dispense
with several works of contributory information. An especially
interesting and valuable item is the private addresses in town and
country of one's friends and correspondents. In briefest space it
gives all that need be known about a man—the date of his birth,
whom he married, where he was educated, what he has done,
how he amuses himself in leisure moments, and where he lives.
Its nearly 7,000 biographies are supplemented by much useful
miscellaneous information.
Mr. BRAM STOKER, having lately harried the world, in Ifracu'a,
with one of the most blood-curdling novels of the age, makes amends
by giving us what my Baronite declares is one of the prettiest.
Mies Bttty (PEARSON) is a story of the days of WALPOLE.
BRAM, in making studies for his background, has happily
caught something of the flavour of the literary style of the age.
Mi»» B-tty is a charming girl, and wins her affianced from evil
ways by a device it would not be fair to disclose in anticipation of
the safely-promised pleasure of reading the book.
Art is long, especially when turned in the direction of book-
making. Life is short; books to be reviewed are multitudinous;
and available space in Mr. Punch's columns is exceedingly small.
But my Baronite rarely resists the temptation to take up a novel
bearing the brand HUTCHINSON. They are a publishing firm of
comparatively new standing. But they must have a taster of
uncommonly quick, true instinct. Certainly they have of late
introduced to the public some promising new hands. MARY E.
MANN, the authoress of The Ctdar Star, was never before heard
of in these parts. But she is bound to go far. To begin with
she has, what is not a common virtue among women who write
books, an excellent literary style. She can draw a character, real
live man, boy or girl, in a few strokes, is inventive of plot and
commonly called Bill, are (especially Bill) creations that remind
one pleasantly of THACKERAY.
"I am emphatically of opinion," wrote that thorough Briton,
JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS, in his outspoken Thoughts on our Art of
To-day, '' that the best Art of modern times is as good as any of
its kind that has gone before, and furthermore that the best Art
in England can hold its own against the world."
Nobly and bravely spoken, stout Sir JOHN! and thanks to
Mr. SPIELMANN for quoting these words iu his latest publication
(BLACKWOOD) entitled Atillais and his Work. Where indeed would
be the modern value of TITIAN and VELASQUEZ without the col-
laboration of tht.se other two great masters, who give to all
pictures the finishing touches, Messieurs Time and \arnish?
Without fear or favour is Mr. SPIELMANN'S work written, and it
will be heartily welcomed by all readers as at once interesting and

Home of Commons, Monday, Feb. 21.—
"Beware when all Irishmen speak well of
thee!"
Thought it kind to drop this observation
in GERALD BALFOTJR'S sensitive ear as he
sat on the Treasury Bench, after introdu-
cing his Local Government Bill. Not that
he is the sort of man to be puffed up. But
provocation unparalleled. For once united,
Irish Members rose up and called the Chief
Secretary blessed. Quite a relief to have
DAVITT put in his knife and turn it in
wounds of landlord, hurt afresh with pro-
mise of having half his poor-rates paid by
British taxpayer. Others, allured by
prospect of deposition of Grand Juries, and
of small fanner relieved of moiety of
County Cesp, might close their eyes to the
bribe offered to the landlord. Honest
MICHAEL DAVITT, uncompromising where
he believes truth to be involved, not to be
mollified.
"Cotupue:: ?es landlords!" he cried,
determined that TANITER shouldn't have a
monopoly of French atte House of Com-
mons.
This variation served to make more
striking the prevailing note.
"Forget whether you were in the House
at the time," I continued, determined to be
cheerful. "If you were, you will remem-
ber that when, in 1886, Mr. G. brought in

when he announced that Bill proposed to
exclude Irish Members from Westminster.
Yet, you know, that was the very point on
which both the Bill and Mr. G. were
broken. It was selected as the jumping-
Uon't wish to say anything discouraging.
But it's a rum place is the House of Com-
mons. Things are not always as they
?eem. More especially where a measure
deals with Ireland, a hearty reception on
its introduction is ominous."

have taken his measure and Like it. Doesn't

spends more than half his holiday time in
the country, and, what's much more, takes
Lndy BETTY with him. An Irish Member
said to me the other day, 'GERALD BAL-

As SARK says, the one touch of nature that
makes all Irishmen kin is opportunity to
finger Saxon gold. Given that, personal
prejudices and all other considerations are
set aside. The wolf dwells with the

them. Which is the wolf, which the lamb,
which the calf, and which the young fat-
ling, are matters of detail that can be set-
tled as soon as the truce is broken. But
there is no doubt about SAUNDERSON.
He was up to-night as spokesman of the
really United Irishmen, wanting to know
from PRINCE AKTIIUR when he is going to
appoint the Commission on Financial Rela-
tions between Great Britain and Ireland?
If 'lin has not made up his mind on that
point, then at least let him give a day to
discws the business.
PRINCE ARTHUR almost melted to tears
turn. Supplementary Estimates the first
Order of Day. Votes raising in succession
question of English and Scotch Education
and of policy in South Africa. Just when
House thought it was going to get into
Committee and do a little work, JOHN
DILLON moves adjournment in order to
discuss as matter of urgent public import-
ance recent row with police at Westport.
So public business set on one side whilst
Irish Members rowed round in faint echo
of good old times, when PRINCE ARTHUR
was Chief Secretary and PARNELL led a
united 1 arty.

at the menagerie arrangement alluded to
above. With faltering voice and hesitating
manner he hinted that Ireland had already
done pretty well. Brother GERALD'S little
Bill assigned to the distressful country a
trifle over £700,000 a year. (Here the voice
of the lamb was heard bleating that the
whole of this went to the wolf—meaning
the landlord.) PRINCE ARTHUR brightened
up a little at this evidence of continued
existence of the old Adam, and went on
more firmly to declare that he really could
not, at the moment, promise any more.
United Irishmen subsequently met in
Committee Room No. 15; some disposition
shown to give expression to their dis-
appointment with PRINCE ARTHUR'S re-
sponse by dropping the Chairman out of the
window. Discovery made that that wary
old campaigner had had the windows
screwed up, Committee adjourned.
Bvsinest done.—First private Members'
night of the Session celebrated by a count-
out at a quarter to eight.
Thursday.—Whatever Ireland may be in
other relations, no question that in Par-
liamentary matters it is the predominant
Party. Really seemed that to-day the
Easy to see what it all meant. On Mon-
day, as mentioned, Irish Members and
Chief Secretary publicly embraced. Sang
together the well-known hymn—
Then blessings on the falling out
That all the more endears,
When wejall out with those we love,
And kiss again with team.
Foity-eight hours' reflection shown the
Irish Members that would never do. All
very well in House of Commons and with
English audience. Not tho sort of thing
to go down in Ireland. Necessary, with
least possible waste of time, to get up public
row with Chief Secretary. Westport inci-
dent opportune; so motion for adjourn-
ment agreed upon, and little_ plot success-
fully carried out,
Brother GERALD for his part nothing
loth to take a hand at the game. He, too,
feels a little uneasy after Monday's per-
formance. Irish landlords inclined to look
with suspicion on Chief Secretary who
strokes the tangles of JOHN DILLON'S hair
. and toys with TIM HEALY in the shade.
I Accordingly Brother G. threw himself into
'the fray with nomething uncommonly like
a whoop of delight. JOHN DILLON roared
Members got up steam; Chief Secretary
shouted contradiction across floor of
House; DILLON made angry rejoinder.
Climax reached when veiled but unmis-
takable allusion was made by Brother G.
to WILLIAM O'BRIEN'S tr s. Plot well
conceived and played with spirit. But,
after all, farce a little hollow. House glad
when it was over and work began.
Business doni.—On Supplementary Voie
for Colonial Service, DON JOSE explains
how much better they manage things in
France, leaving the Colonial Secretary
with a free hand.
Friday.—Estimates, involving far-reach-
ing reform of Army, introduced by BROD-
RICK in speech of conspicuous lucidity. In
old times the Colonels and the Generals,
horse and foot, would on such incentive
have deployed, making a cheerful night of
it. Now modestly retired to the rear whilst
those eminent strategists, Field-Marshal
Sir CHARLES DILKB, V.C., and Adjutant-
General ARNOLD-FORSTER, D.S.O., put
matters right.
Pretty to see the Duke of CONNAUOHT
listening from Peers' Gallery with rapt at-
tention to ARNOLD-FORSTER. As for four
sergeants in uniform in the back Gallery,
they were so impressed that, as first syllable
of his commanding voice fell on their ear,
they with one accord rose to salute. Wan-
ted, they explained, to remain "at atten-
tion" whilst he declaimed the Order of the
Day. The lay mind of the Crown messen-
in attendance on the Gallery implacably
donse.
"Oh," they said, "you can pay atten-
tion just as well sitting down. You see,
that's the way people listen here."

duced.

my way to join it.

Nib. Yes, and not get served in the

change! No house-rent, no rates, no taxes,
no anxieties! Come, come, you •will be
happy all the day!
Nib. A matter of taste. The omnibus

models of peaceful happiness.
Serg. You surely don't compare your-

ment that will occupy all my time for the
next five years.
Serg. Come, come, that is merely an
excuse. Tell me why you won't join r

A. PLAIN old maid WM I,
With tpectacles on nose;
I wound my dou ble-ply
And knitted nephews' hose.
And all my brother*' wives,
And slaters who had spouses,
They led such busy lives
With servants, babes, and houses,
That, when they came to talk
A bout their own affairs,—
How Baby learnt to walk,
But TOMMY fell down stairs;
Of social obligation*,
Of dinners and of balls;
Of duty invitations,
And necessary calls ; —
I knitted nephews' hose,
And wound my double-ply,
And felt rejoiced I chose
A spin, to live and die.
I owned a peevish cat,
'Twas seldom heard to purr;
It occupied the mat,
And moulted all its fur.
My parrot's ways were worse;
He ruffled in his rage,
And loud and deep he 'd curse
When friends approached his cage.
But talk of bird or cat—
Bored would my sisters look!
And yet I had to chat
For hours of babe or cook.
And when MAB had the mumps,
Or FREDDY had the fever,
Or Baby got the jumps
And Mother had to leave her,
Why, then to me they 'd send,
"Please come at once, dear PRDE;
I Ve so much to attend,—
You Ve nothing else to do!"
For everybody asks
The help of those who '11 aid
In doing others' tasks,
Unhonoured, and unpaid.
In sudden wrath I rose—
It should no longer he!
I burnt my nephews' hose,
The parrot I set free,
I boarded out the cat,
I vowed a solemn vow
That I 'd revolt, and that
I'd live my life I So now--
A modern spinster I
With latch-key for my Chubb;
I roll my cigarette,
And cycle to my club;
For I have come to see

New duties mine, new aims,
New books, new thoughts, new scopes,
New friends, new spheres, new claims,
New power for good, new hopes.
And so my brothers' wives,
And sisters who hav« spouses,
Must manage their own lives,
Their children, and their houses;
And this is why they toss
Their heads, and, with acumen,
When they 're found out, turn cross.

"FAITHLESS and unkind!" cried DULCINKA, repulsing her lover
with a gesture of haughty disdain. "Cruel and treacherous!
Nay, never can I be the bride of a man who lightly breaks his
word as thou hast done!"
"8ay not so, my love!" protested ALONZO, looking greatly
bewildered. "Of a certainty I could never be go base as to
neglect aught that I had promised my dear DULCINKA 1 Kindly
have the goodness to explain"
"Explain P Hath the remembrance of thy vow so soon escaped
thee? Didst thou not agree to meet me at midnight beneath
yonder oak when the moon was full? Ay, since, owing to my
father's displeasure, I can but see thee by stealth, thou didst
decliro that it must be when the moon was full, the better to gaze
upon iny face I"
"True indeed," ALONZO replied. "I made a note of our com-
pact at the time. And, on the night of full moon, I was at the
appointed spot. But it was tlum who didst fail, DULCINKA I"
"Untruthful!" sobbed DULCINKA. "Of all false deceivers"
"Not a bit of it," retorted the other. "At the night and hour
appointed I was there, and tarried two hours for thee in vain—it
was raining hard, too. Methought the weather, or else the
vigilance of thy sire, kept thee within the castle."
DULCINKA gazed at him incredulously. "Then thou wert there
only iii thy dreams 1" she said, indignantly. "Punctual to the
appointed hour came I to that oak-tree, and waited vainly for the
faithless ALONZO!" And she wept afresh.
"Alack, sorrow hath turned thy brain," laid ALONZO, sadly.
"I was beneath that tree, but D CLCI.VKA came not 1 Why, 'tis
only two nights past •
"Two nights P ALONZO, thou art distraught 1 Twag full moon
a fortnight ago I"
"Therein I can prove thee wrong," ALONZO replied, producing
a pocket-calendar from his doublet. "Here thou mayst read
that—why," he broke off suddenly, rushing forward and clasping
the astonished DULCINBA in his arms, "why, now I understand 1
the moon was full, but we did not say which moon; and nowadays-
there are two of them I"
"My sweet ALONZO 1" cried DULCINKA, embracing him fondly.
"That explains all! For when one moon is new the other is
already at its full. Pardon thy foolish DULCINKA! For the
future, we must needs be more precise. And now thou must fly,
for if my stern father should find thee here, terrible would be the
consequences."
ALONZO sighed. "Canst thou not quit him for goodP
Methinks that did I come hither with two swift steeds on some
dark night, we might fly together!"
"Nay," replied DULCINKA, sadly. "That were impossible.
Thou dost forget that now there are two moons, and conse-
quently, no dark nights. But hark 1 What is that P"
Even as she spoke a dozen armed men, with her father, the
Baron D'AOINCOUAT, at their head, leapt from behind the bushes
upon the hapless ALONZO.
"Ha!" shouted the Baron in triumph, " so I have thee at last,
villain! Bind him tightly, my trusty followers, and dispose of
mm as I have instructed you I No more wilt thou come tres-
passing here, I warrant I Heed not his kicking, bind him
tightly, I tell you. Ill is it for thee, thou varlet, that thou hast
disobeyed the Baron D'AOINCOURT 1 And cease those silly noises,
DULCINKA. Get thee to bed, girl 1 This fellow will trouble thee
no more 1"
But the lovely DULCINKA gave one despairing shriek and fell to
the ground in a swoon, as her father's men carried off the gagged
and fetterei form of her dear ALONZO.
II.
Oil the following morning the Baron D'AoiNOOURT sat at his
breakfast in a very good temper. Suddenly an idea struck him,
and, calling a servant, be bade him summon his daughter.
DULCINKA appeared, pale and distraught, her eyes red with
weeping.
"Uood morning," said the Baron, with an evil smile. "Pray
be seated. Thou hast not breakfasted, I think P This bacon i»
excellent, I assure thee."
"FatherI" cried the unhappy girl, falling on her knees before
him, ''tell me—tell me quickly—what hast thou done with

How gross my folly in forgetting it 1 We resolved to meet when

matter of fact, he 's dead—comfortably dead and drowned."
"You, lie!" said a voice—and lo! in the doorway stood ALONZO

The Baron fell back in hit seat and gazed at him in terror.
"Tis a spook!" he gasped. "A nasty horrid spook!"
"Nay, said ALONZO, '''tis no spook 1 Fear not, DULCINRA,

"But I gave the plainest orders," expostulated the Baron.
"They wera to take thee to the beach and there tie thee to a

ALOXZO confronted him with a look of triumph. "Blame not

They tied me to the stake so thoughtfully selected—only one fact

the ocean equally, but in contrary directions, and, as a conse-
quence, there are no tides! At daybreak a friendly fisherman cut

OUR BOYS.
(By a Father of Tm.)
I.
OF late years I have been much distressed to notice the great
and increasing number of men who remain unmarried; and when
visiting my friends, I hear on all sides the despairing cry, "What
are we to do with our boys? Nowadays women won't marry
them!" As one who has successfully settled ten dowerless sons,
I claim to speak with some authority on this subject, and I
venture to hope that my words may be of use and comfort to
distracted fathers.
I propose to deal with the question in two articles. In the
first I shall discuss generally the relation of the husband to the
wife: in the second I shall offer some practical hints on the
training of boys with a view to the improvement of their matri-
monial prospects.
At the outset, let me say this: it is absolutely necessary to
realise once and for all this vital truth, that man's place it the
Home. Here lies the crux of the whole question, and the sooner
the fact is understood and accepted, the sooner we shall be spared
the pain of seeing our bonny boys neglected and souring into a
loveless age of nervous, fussy old bachelorhood. I insist the
more upon this, because I know fathers who still cling to what I
may call the superstition of an antiquated creed, that home is the
woman's sphere! Blind to the spirit of the Age, they thrust their
sons into such professions as are still open to them, and expect
them to compete with woman in her own domain— medicine, the
Bar, the Church. The result, of course, is a foregone conclusion.
Who expects a man to compete with women in work that requires
brain P
There are others again, who send their sons into the professions,
not because they ever expect them to make a livelihood thereby,
but simply to fit them for matrimony. "What," they ask,
"what does a woman look for in a husband? A pretty doll P A
plaything? A drawing-room ornament? No, she wants more
than that: she wants some one who, if he cannot actually give
her advice, can at least talk intelligently about her affairs. At
the first blush, there is something plausible in this, and it con-
jures up so pretty a picture of conjugal co-operation and con-
fidence that one could almost wish it were true. But a very
small experience of the world suffices to explode the theory.
Women don't consult their husbands on business. On any point
beyond his immediate domain, women have the heartiest con-
tempt for a man's opinion. And rightly so. What would a
father say if his wife advised him how to feed the baby?
No! this is not what a woman looks for in a husband. She
wants not an inferior copy, but the complement of herself. To the
feminine mind nothing is more detestable than the blue-stocking
man who tries to talk business or politics, and apes the woman.
When a wife comes home tired from the City, she does not wish
to discuss stocks and shares; she has been doing nothing else all
day; she wants change, amusement, relaxation, and a husband,
if he would not drive her out to the club, should be ready to sing
and play to her, or entertain her with light pleasant chat.

feel confident that the house will be well ordered in her
absence; that the children will be sent off to school, the servants
apportioned their tasks, and the babies put to bed before her

"FAITHLESS and unkind!" cried DULCINEA, repulsing her lover
with a gesture of haughty disdain. "Cruel and treacherous!
Nay, never can I be the bride of a man who lightly breaks his
word as thou hast done!"
"Say not so, my love I" protested ALONZO, looking greatly
bewildered. "Of a certainty I could never be so base as to
neglect aught that I had promised my dear DULCINEA! Kindly
have the goodness to explain"
"Explain:- Uath the remembrance of thy vow so soon escaped
thee? Didst thou not agree to meet me at midnight beneath
yonder oak when the moon was full? Ay, since, owing to my
father's displeasure, I can but see thee by stealth, thou didst
declvro that it must be when the moon was full, the better to gaze
upon my face!"
"True indeed," ALONZO replied. "I made a note of our com-
pact at the time. And, on the night of full moon, I was at the
appointed spot. But it was thou who didst fail, DULCINEA!"
"Untruthful!" sobbed DULCINKA. "Of all false deceivers"
"Not a bit of it," retorted the other. "At the night and hour
appointed I was there, and tarried two hours for thee in vain—it
was raining hard, too. Methought the weather, or else the
vigilance of thy sire, kept thee within the castle."
DDI.CINKA gazed at him incredulously. "Then thou wert there
only in thy dreams!" she said, indignantly. "Punctual to the
appointed hour came I to that oak-tree, and waited vainly for the
faithless ALONZO!" And she wept afresh.
"Alack, sorrow hath turned thy brain," said ALONZO, sadly.
'' I was beneath that tree, but DULCINBA came not I Why, 'tis

"Two nights? ALONZO, thou art distraught I Twas full moon

"Therein I can prove thee wrong," ALONZO replied, producing
a pocket-calendar from his doublet. "Here thou mayst read
that—why," he broke off suddenly, rushing forward and clasping
the astonished DULCINEA in his arms, "why, now I understand I
the moon was full, bt^t we did not say which moon; and nowadays
there are two of them I"
"My sweet ALONZO!" cried DULCINEA, embracing him fondly.
"That explains all 1 For when one moon is new the other is
already at its full. Pardon thy foolish DULCINEA! For the
future, we must needs be more precise. And now thou must fly,
for if my stern father should find thee here, terrible would be the
consequences."
ALONZO sighed. "Canst thou not quit him for good P
Methinks that did I come hither with two swift steeds on some
dark night, we might fly together!"
"Nay," replied DULCINEA, sadly. "That were impossible.
Thou dost forget that now there are two moons, and conse-
quently, no dark nights. But hark! What is that?"
Even as she spoke a dozen armed men, with her father, the
Baron D'AaiNCOURT, at their head, leapt from behind the bushes
upon the hapless ALONZO.
"Ha!" shouted the Baron in triumph, "so I have thee at last,
villain! Bind him tightly, my trusty followers, and dispose oi

passing here, I warrant! Heed not his kicking; bind him

DULCINEA. Get thee to bed, girl 1 This fellow will trouble thee
no more 1"
But the lovely DULCINEA gave one despairing shriek and fell to
the ground in a swoon, as her father's men carried off the gagged
and fettere'l form of her dear ALONZO.

Ou the following morning the Baron D'AoiNCouRT sat at his
breakfast in a very good temper. Suddenly an idea struck him,
and, calling a servant, be bade him summon his daughter.
DULGINBA appeared, pale and distraught, her eyes red with
weeping.
"Good morning," said the Baron, with an evil smile. "Pray
be seated. Thou hast not breakfasted, I think? This bacon U

"You, lie.'" said a voice—and lo I in the doorway stood ALONZO

The Baron fell back in hi: seat and gaged at him in terror.
"'Tis a spook!" he gasped. "A nasty. Horrid spook!"
"Nay, said ALONZO, "'tis no spook I Fear not, DULCINKA,
thine ALONZO is alive and well!"
"But I gave the plainest orders," expostulated the Baron.
"They were to take thee to the beach and there tie thee to a
stake which is covered at high water, so thou wouldst be slowly
but surely drowned. The knaves have played me false!"
ALOXZO confronted him with a look of triumph. "Blame not
thy minion-,," he said, " for they fulfilled thy commands faithfully.
They tied me to the stake so thoughtfully selected—only one fact

the ocean equally, but in contrary directions, and, as a conse-

OUR BOYS.
(By a Father of Tm.)
I.
OF late years I have been much distressed to notice the great
and increasing number of men who remain unmarried; and when
visiting my mends, I hear on all sides the despairing cry, "What
are we to do with our boys f Nowadays women won't marry
them!" As one who has successfully settled ten dowerless sons,
I claim to speak with some authority on this subject, and I
venture to hope that my words may be of use and comfort to
distracted fathers.
I propose to deal with the question in two articles. In the
first I shall discuss generally the relation of the husband to the
wife: in the second I shall offer some practical hints on the
training of boys with a view to the improvement of their matri-
monial prospects.
At the outset, let me say this: it is absolutely necessary to
realise once and for all this vital truth, that man's place i» the
Hume. Here lies the crux of the whole question, and the sooner
the fact is understood and accepted, the sooner we shall be spared
the pain of seeing our bonny boys neglected and souring into a
loveless age of nervous, fussy old bachelorhood. I insist the
more upon this, because I know fathers who still cling to what I
may call the superstition of an antiquated creed, that home is the
woman'i sphere! Blind to the spirit of the Age, they thrust their
sons into such professions as are still open to them, and expect
them to compete with woman in her own domain— medicine, the
Bar, the Church. The result, of course, is a foregone conclusion.
Who expects a man to compete with women in work that requires
brain?
There are others again, who send their sons into the professions,
not because they ever expect them to make a livelihood thereby,
but simply to fit them for matrimony. "What," they ask,
"what does a woman look for in a husband P A pretty doll P A
plaything? A drawing-room ornament P No, she wants more
than that: she wants some one who, if he cannot actually give
her advice, can at least talk intelligently about her affairs. At
the first blush, there is something plausible in this, and it con-
jures up so pretty a picture of conjugal co-operation and con-
fidence that one could almost wish it were true. But a very
small experience of the world suffices to explode the theory.
Women don't consult their husbands on business. On any point
beyond his immediate domain, women have the heartiest con-
tempt for a man's opinion. And rightly so. What would a
father say if his wife advised him how to feed the baby?
No! this is not what a woman looks for in a husband. She
wants not an inferior copy, but the complement of herself. To the
feminine mind nothing is more detestable than the blue-stocking
man who tries to talk business or politics, and apes the woman.
When a wife comes home tired from the City, she does not wish
to discuss stocks and shares; she has been doing nothing else all
day; she wants change, amusement, relaxation, and a husband,
if he would not drive her out to the club, should be ready to sing
and play to her, or entertain her •with light pleasant chat.

Court, which apparently treats of the second order of professional
actors and actresses, representing them as domestically virtuous,
though of quaint and uncultivated manners, Mr. GRIBBLE'S novel
purports to place before us the vie la plus intime of the artistes du
premier rang. Likewise, he notes the marked distinction be-
tween the English and French players; the hitter, says he, are
Bohemians, a class apart, and "proud <>' the title, as the liviii'
skeleton said," according to Mr. Sam Weller; while the chief
object of leading English actors and actresses, though they are
at heart true Bohemians, is to be accepted at their own valua-
tion by " Society." Consequently, being rejoiced above measure
at any opportunity of putting themselves en evidence before
"London Society," which "makes special rules for actresses,"
they accept the invitations of Lady Brevil, of Harley Street,
whose receptions are to Society, the Arts, and the Players, as is
the common ground of Philanthropy to th« various antagonistic
sects. The conventional trammels of artificially polite "Society"
must be most irksome to true "Bohemian girls" who live
"unchaperoned lives," and who have "largely dropped the habit
of using language to conceal their thoughts, BO that when these
light-hearted young stagers on the "spindle side" thought
"d n " they said it, and, to quote Ingoldsby, "no one seemed
a penny the worse." This expletive the men in this story, pro-
"sound and fury, signifying nothing." The dramatis persona; of
Mr. GRIBBLE'S story are not among the rank and file of the
theatrical profession as are Mr. GEORGE MOORE'S characters, in
A Mummer's Wife,, or as they are in JOHN BICKERDYKE'S
Daughters of Thespis, for Mr. GRIBBLE'S hero is a modern
"actor-manager" who is received into the very best mixed
Society, and is "in a fair way towards knighthood." The
heroine, who is this actor-manager's leading lady at a London
theatre, was one of his companions in the travelling company of|
which they were both members; and, in a weak moment, he might;
have, ^married her, had they not " both lived in a world that was
quite tolerant of unions less binding than that of marriage, and;
Hector was quite sure that some day, and if it did not come to
marriage, it would come to that." Angela unfortunately marries
a gifted sot of a dramatic author, almost a genius, from whom!
she is soon separated, and when she does occasionally see him, it
is, as a rule, only when he happens to be in want of cash. The!
poor drunken creature dies, and one of the most powerfully-j
written scenes in the story is when the young widow and the
actor-manager search for the dead man's missing play. The!
conclusion of the story is common-place, but not the less true to,
Nature on that account. The fault in the story is, that among allj
the characters, "there is none that doeth good, no not one.";
There is no particular moral to be deduced from Mr. GRIBBLE'S
novel, except, perhaps, that as the hero and heroine are well
worthy of one another, it is according to the fitness of things that
such a pair, so justly formed to meet by Nature and Art, should]
be united in the bonds of matrimony by Mr. GRIBBLB.
A diverting book is Cassock and Comedy (SKEFFINOTON), byj
ATHOL FORBES, professing to show the "humorous side of clerical
life," though some of the stories must be credited to the pathetic
side of humour, and might well find a place in a Zangwiilian
romance of Whitechapel. Here and there among the tales the
Baron comes across some ancient friends, on which, years ago,
the pencils of Du MAURIER and of CHARLES KEENE conferred
an immortality, and pleased is he, "as pleased as Punch " in fact,
to see them as fresh as ever. They 'are all told in so pleasant a
chatty-coffee-cum-cigar fashion, as enables the reader to take up
the book and enjoy one or more of the stories just when he may-
have ten minutes allowed him for refreshment.

MB. PUNCH, having heard that a Com-
mercial University is to be started in
Leipsio after Easter, is anxious that the
authorities of Oxford and Cambridge should
place our youths on a fair footing with
their German competitors. This could
easily be done. It only involves a slight
change in the curriculum to the following
or similar effect: —
Smalls.—For "Apology" and "Mono"
substitute Book-keeping and Shorthand.
Latin to be optional, typewriting compul-
sory.
Mods.—For DEMOSTHENES' De Corona,
and HOMKK'S Hunt, substitute General
Commercial Correspondence and the
Theory of Bargains. In place of AEIS-
TOTLE'S Poetics, a special subject must be
offered, e.g., hardwares, green-grocery,
meat, herring-pickling, hotel management,
bogus Dresden china, &c., in which there
will be a practical as well as a theoretical
subject.
Greats.—Abolish PLATO'S Republic and
ARISTOTLE'S Ethics, and read instead
SMITH'S Heady Beckoner and The Complete
Shopwalker and Commercial Traveller.
There will be a further examination in the
special subject, including the doing-up of
parcels with string and sealing-wax, open-
ing of doors to ladies, and general eti-
quette. By the time a student takes his
degree in commerce he will be an accom-
plished salesman, and Mr. Punch is confi-
dent that thus, and thus only, the bogey of
foreign competition will be scared away.

ElTRAOTBD fBOM TH1 DlABT Or TOBT, M.P-
House of Commont, Monday, Feb. 28.—
CHARLIE BERESFORD probably only Mem-
ber who could have lifted to-night's debate
out of hopeless rut into which it had fallen.
Army Votes up again; agreed at outset
that topic is not one to fight round. Bla-
tant cry of " Vive VArmee !" that fills the
streets of Paris finds echo at Westminster.
Government decided on spending addi-
tional million or so in strengthening Army.
Only a traitor would whisper discontent.
Conclusion foregone. Might just as well
have voted the men and money at conclu-
sion of ST. JOHN B HOD KICK'S speech on
Friday night. That of course would not
do. Must make at least two nights of it.
So here we are—at least twenty-seven of
us—listening to FEROUSSON, who, before
he was at the Post-Office, was in the
Guards. To-night did sentry-go for nearly
an hour round estimates.
When BERESFORD "came aboard " decks
almost empty. Everybody seemed to have
turned in; strolled back in twos and threes
and tens as CHARLIE went on with his
yarn. When he sat down quite full muster.
Subject being the Army Estimates, C. B.
presumably interposed in character of
marine. Whatever uniform he concealed,
assurance that at least he knew something
of subject; had smelt gunpowder when it
was blazing on other occasions than royal
salute. Speaks more effectively than he
did when last with us. Then rather dis-
posed to make set speeches. To-night
talked to the House—or, as for economy's
sake he sometimes put it, "the "Ouse."
Special interest attached to occasion, as
it might be his last speech in present Par-
liament. Candidly admitted that, regard-
ing CAWMELL-BANNERMAN as a self-
confessed old-fashioned Constitutionalist,
he had for a long time been endeavouring
to get him hung. "More or less," he
added, relenting, as he looked on the kindly
countenance of the ex-Secretary of State
for War. Actually, it was C. B. himself
who stood on the edge of doom. To-
morrow and next day votes at York elec-
tion will be re-counted. If there has been
any blunder, CHARLIE, though he may
remain York's darling, will not be its
Member.
"I acknowledge," he said, just now,
"that I am only a temporary Member."
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD had referred to
him as the one ewe lamb of the Unionist
Party, a precious but frail possession,
snatched out of the fire of the bye-elec-
tions. "Well, I hope," said CHARLIE,
making as though he would butt in a
sitting immediately opposite, "that after
Wednesday he will find I am a vigorous
ram."
Btutinest done.—Quite a lot. War Office
got the men and got the money too. Four
Government Bills advanced a stage, and,
the board being clear on stroke of eleven,
Members went home.
Tuesday. — Once upon a time PRINCE
ARTHUR, talking to me about the SQUIRE
OF MALWOOD, said, "Since Mr. GLAD-
STONE left the House HARCOURT is the
greatest Parliament man left to us. We
on our side of the House gird at him on
occasion. But we are all secretly proud of
him."
This characteristically generous tribute
from a political adversary justified to-night.
The Sheffield Knight, prancing his hobby-
horse round the listo, chattered for nearly
an hour about Russian designs on China.
Sound and fury, as usual signifying
nothing. CAP'EN TOMMY BOWLES, who
ought to know better, appropriated another
hour of a sitting predestined to be short.
If the SQUIRE had followed example of
majority of Members he would have left
the House. But Leader of the Opposition
saw in Sheffield Knight's reckless indiscre-
tion opportunity of accomplishing act of
patriotic statesmanship. Both the Knight
and the CAP'EN, tilting at windmills, made

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Sir William and the "Vigorous Ram " (LordT. B-r-sf-rd).
showing how he ia a tyro in diplomacy,
how much tetter it would be for the
Empire were they installed with plenary
power in Downing Street.
Here was an opportunity for a small
tactician to make things uncomfortable
for Government. The SQUIRE OF MAL-
WOOD, after a preliminary knocking to-
gether of two puny heads, thereafter
looked far above them, dealing in spirit
of lofty statesmanship with the Imperial
question to which Sheffield Knight and
Seafaring Man had attached themselves.
He smiled at midnight entrances with
sanguinary telegrams; laughed at scares
which make and mar fortunes on the Stock
Exchange; expressed full confidence in
the Foreign Secretary's intent and action;
and only asked that the MARKIBS would,
with Prince Hal confounding Fuletaff,
"mark now how plain a tale shall put you
down."
GEORGE CUHZON, compelled by friendly
invitation, made a plain statement designed
to clear the air of twaddle and fable. Thus,
thanks to the Loader of the Opposition,
what promised to be an idly spent, if not
absolutely mischievous sitting, was trans-
formed into an important occasion.
As GEORGE CURZON put it in one of
many finely turned sentences that illumined
his speech, the generous and loyal support
the Government had received from Leaders
of the Opposition in their foreign policy
placed graver responsibility upon their
shoulders, since they felt they were " act-
ing not merely as the nominees of a Parlia-
mentary majority, but as the trustees of a
nation.
Butinfit done.—Second private Members'
night of Session. By odd coincidence,
second count-out.
Thursday.—Curious how old habits stick
Chairman of Ways and Means after n
Member has succeeded in catching his eye,
is "Mr. LOWTHER." H. M. STANLEY, up
just now on Uganda question, fixing the
Chairman with falcon eye, says, "Mr.
LOWTHER, I presume?" After pause long
enough to afford opening for contradiction
if it be forthcoming, STANLEY goes on with
his speech.
A capital speaker he is, too; delightfully
unconventional. Very rarely interposes:
always on subject with which he is familiar.
Even GEORGE CURZON hasn't been to
Uganda. STANLEY only man in House who
knows the place and the people. Talked
about them and their hardships with slow
utterance and grave manner suggestive ot
a palaver. No ona would have been sur-
prised if, when he sat down, he had
grunted, after the manner of Uncas, Last
of the Mohicans, "STANLEY has spoken,"
wrapped himself up in a blanket, lit a short
pipe, and stared into immensity, silent and
motionless.
But alack! tha veneer of civilisation lies
glossy and thick on our late leader of for-
lorn trails through African jungles. He
wears a top hat, frock coat, and is said to
have been seen with gloves on; not those
little nine-ounce toys that suffuse the prize-
ring with playfulness, but DENT'S two-
buttoned, size 8J.
His politeness almost preternatural.
Talking of the railway from Mombasa, he
said only a hundred miles had been laid in
more than two years.
"One hundred and thirty-two," cor-
rected GEORGE CURZON.
"One hundred and thirty-two. Thank
you, Sir," said STANLEY, turning with a
low bow in the direction of the voice.
Auctioneer ROBBINS in his prime never
did a thing better. One almost expected
to hear STANLEY repeat, "132 guineas;
going at 132 guineas," and then the rap
of the hammer.
Friday.— Irish Members receive with
mixed feelings rumour persistently current.
MACALEESE has brought in Bill making it
legal for a man to prefix O or Mac to his
family name. Story is that Brother
GERALD, more Irish than the Knight ot
Kerry, will avail himself of the privilege as
soon as the Bill receives the Royal Assent.
Hag an idea that if he were known as THE
O'BALFOUR, he would further his heart's
desire of being brought into closer and
friendlier communication with the mass of
the Irish people.
There is something in the idea. Its
drawback is, as SAIIK points out, the easi-
ness of its application to an indefinitely
wide circle, and the consequent limitation
of personal advantage. If Brother GERALD
sets the example at the Irish Office, it will
be followed, as a matter of course, by those
who come after him. THE MACMOHLFT
would naturally succeed THE O'BALFOUB,
and where would be the distinction?

It is impolite to tell me to go to the

It is not my business to verify your
statement that the flag is wounded, but I
must insist that it be hauled down.
I deprecate your threat that you will use
violence if I touch it.
I am here because I am France, and
Frunze claims this territory.
I da not wish to "get out," for where T
rest I desire to remain.
I am not accustomed to the box, and I
decline to submit my head to the punching.
I will direct vour attention to the fact
that I am an officer of hieh rank, and that
you are a simple sergeant.

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
No. IX.—To MR. W. A. L. FLETCHER
CHRIST CHURCH, OXFORD; COACH OF THK
CAMBRIDGE CHEW.
MY DEAB SIR,— Those who know the
spirit and the habits of Englishmen in
general, and of Mr. I'unch in particular,
will not have been surprised to nnd your
name at the bead of this column. For Mr.
Flinch, representing in this matter the
great body of his tellow-countrymen, has
never failed to pay honour to one who is, in
tne best sense of the words, a good sports-
man and a line fellow. And he has always
looked with an eye of peculiar kindness and
admiration on tiie prowess of tnose gallant
youngsters from Oxford and from Cam-
bridge, who, braving the icy blasts of win-
ter and the stormy waves ot our great tidal
river, strive tor honour's sake alone to
show which set of them, the dark-blued or
tne light-blued, can propel a racing eight
the faster from Putney to Mortlake.
Ot these you yourself have in the past
been one. Once at stroke, once at No. 7,
and twice at No. 6, has the broad expanse
of your massive back swung past the
judge's flag at Mortlake in winning Oxford
crews. Strength, stamina, a perfect ba-
lance and control of all your limbs and
sinews, an undisturbed serenity of mind,
dauntless resolution, and, when the occa-
sion called for it, unquenchable pluck—all
these qualities were yours as an active
rowing man. It was an inspiring sight at
the end of a closely contested race, while
some lay helpless and gasped in pale dis-
tress, to note your ruddy colour and your
cheerful smile. So smiled and so flushed
some mighty Viking emerging triumphant
from a death-grapple with his toe, while the
air resounded with the clash of steel and
the shouts of contending men.
And now, the days of your labour at the
oar being past, you, an Oxford man, have
come to teach Cambridge men, once suc-
cessful, but now fallen through eight suc-
cessive defeats from their post of pride,
how oars should be handled, boats pro-
pelled, and races won. It is no small task.
For months and months a coach labours
with his men. How anxious and unpleas-
ing is the work of teaching and selection
for an eight-oared crew, only those who
have themselves endured it can fully know.
First one man and then another falls short
of the promise of his early efforts, and has
to recede into forgetfulness uncheered by
a blue coat. Accident or illness robs you
of your best pupils, the boat you have
ordered with care proves unsuitable, but
through all these changes and chances he
who is instructing must keep his temper,
and smile and do his best. His crew looks
to him as the Tenth Legion looked to
C.ESAR for guidance and encouragement;
and, whoever else may falter or fail,
he at least must always keep a calm and
unbroken front, and breathe the promise
of victory. This is the common task of all
coaches. But yours has been no common
task. You are not a Cambridge man. To
you the success of the Oxford crew has
hitherto been a matter for delight. Ana
yet you are now, as a Cambridge coach,
doing what in you lies to ensure the
triumph of Cambridge over your ancient
associates. And this you do, not in the
hope of gain, or even in the desire for
glory, but impelled by that chivalrous feel-
ing of honourable sportsmanship which has

who wield an oar, and which, as much as
anything else, has placed the contest ot
Oxford and Cambridge on the Thames high
in the affection of our sport-loving people.
To row or to race is in itself nothing.
But to be a chieftain in a brotherhood of
athletes who, for the mere love of sport
and manly effort, have striven and battled
and endured, who, unsullied by even the
suspicion of fraud or meanness, have held
aloft, as their most cherished possession,
high traditions of honour bequeathed to
them by their sires—this, Sir, is some-
thing, and for this you have the praise of
Mr. Punch. All Cambridge men wish you
well: it is the secret hope of not a few
Cambridge to stem, if that be possible, the
tide of Oxford victories, may be crowned
with success. And for myself, Sir, I
remain now, as always, your humble
admirer. THB VAGRANT.

OUfl BOYS.
(By a Father of Ten.)
II.
HAVING determined what it is that a woman desiderates in her
husband, I now proceed to consider the beet means of producing
these qualities—in other words, how we ure best to fit our sons
for the all-important duties of the husband and the father.
Netdleworlc.—I rank this as the very foremost consideration.
Every boy should be clever with his needle. There is nothing
annoys a woman so much as to find her boots and gloves button-
less, and I have known more domestic unhappiness created, and
more homes ruined from this than from any other cause. I do
not say that all men should be expected to do fancy work—this is
a matter of individual taste: but I do insist that it is the impera-
tive duty of every father to see that his sons are good plain
needlemen. A man who cannot make his wife's pyjamas and his
baby's chemise has no right to expect to get married.
^Music.—This is an indispensable accomplishment. When a
woman takes her husband out in the evening, she naturally likes
him to make a good appearance in the drawing-room. Every
boy, therefore,—ear or no ear, voice or no voice,—should be
taught to sing and play. A slight knowledge of music will be
found invaluable when the babies wake up in the night. Nothing
tries a wife's temper so severely as a lullaby sung out of tune.
French is a polite acquisition, and a wife always expects her
husband to be able to translate a menu. Great care, however,
must be exercised in selecting the books to be studied, for there
is much in the literature that no woman would like to think that
her husband had read.
Athletics.—On no point is the relation of the sexes so much
misunderstood as in this connection. There is still quite a general
belief that women prefer men who can cycle or play tennis with
them, and many a poor boy have I known overtax his strength
and ruin his constitution in a vain attempt to keep pace with nis
sisters and their friends. No doubt there ore "gentlemen's women"
don't like them in the marrying sense. I have often heard fathers
say, " Dear JACK is getting on quite nicely with his bicycle! It
will be so delightful for him when he is married, for he will be
able to go with his wife on her cycling tours." I shake my head
at these remarks, for, in all my experience, I have never known
a wife take her husband touring a second time. When a woman
rides, she does not want to wait for her husband at all the hills;
she wants to go her own pace—to be free. Muscle was clearly
intended to be her monopoly: let not man seek to meddle with
it. As I said before, his place is the Home. There let him stay.
He will be far happier darning the socks and making the straw-
berry jam than straining after his wife on the dusty high road,
knowing that with every turn of the wheel he looks more and
more hot, horrid, freckled, and uncomfortable.
These remarks of mine may seem, at first sight, simple and
indeed, obvious; but I am convinced that they embody a great
and important truth. If parents will carefully study them, they
will talk less of the decay of marriage; they will have no diffi-
culty in finding wives for their sons, whom they will live to see
settled in happy homes, with bright, merry families growing up
about them.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THB DIART OF TOBT, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, March 7.—That
BOBS could fight the world has long known.
That he could write it has lately learned.
That he can speak, and speak in House
close to seat from which he had risen.
But what with contemplation of two hundre d
thousand fighting-men on the North-West
Frontier; what with admiration of EGBERT
SANDEMAN in Baluchistan; what with
pained reflection on some incidents of Lord
BIPON'S Viceroyalty; and what with the

of Lords, is his latest contribution to the
knowledge of mankind. This gilded Cham-
ber is the sepulchre of speech. To-night
BOBS broke its silence with pleasant, clear,
well-modulated voice, heard without effort
in remotest corners. Gestures few, but
suited to the turn of sentence they empha-
size. A splendid audience both on floor
and in galleries. Commons fled hither from
their own House, crowding their gallery,
thronging the Bar.
"Privy Councillors are cheap to-day,"
said SARK, looking at the unprecedented
muster before the steps of the Throne.
A sight and an occasion that would have
unnerved some men of proved pluck. BOBS
took it as quietly as if it were merely a
sudden attack by Mongols in the Sapari
Pass. Early in his place, which he selected
on Front Cross Bench, at the remote end
from that Prince of WALES frequents.
Neither flustered nor forward, awaited the
call. "Lord EGBERTS or KANDAHAR, "cried
the LORD CHANCELLOR; and lo ! BOBS was
there.
Engrossing interest of speech varied by
watching consternation of COLVILLE OF
CTJLROSS in prospect of BOBS presently
riding him down. Before the Front Cross
Bench lies an open space bounded in front
by the Table, at which the Clerks cluster:
on the left, by the bench below Gangway. At
corner seat of this bench sat Lord COLTUXE;
a happy position, with the speaker of the
evening in full view a couple of paces off.
For first twenty minutes BOBS followed
spectacle of Russia, with elbows leaning on
the Hindoo Kush, staring rudely at blush-
ing India, BOBS' blood began to boil.
Commenced series of nyxrching and
counter-marching that seemed preliminary
to a fresh start for KANDAHAR. After
various reconnaissances and feints, the
object of his march became apparent. He
bore straight down on the Gangway, at
corner whereof Lord COLVILLE sat. Arrived
there, he faced about, his rear-guard press-
ing heavily on the enemy from Culross.
COLVILLE, the gentlest-mannered peer of
Parliament, became painfully conscious of
his own legs. He must put them somewhere,
and their most natural position seemed in
front of him as he sat. But if he left them
there, the steady rearward motion of the
invading force would lead to unpleasant
consequences. So, with a strategy that
would have extorted admiration from the
captor of Umbeyla had his back not been
turned, CoLVTLLE slowly swung his limbs
round till they were landed in safe quar-
ters in the Gangway.
Thus BOBS, having dislodged the enemy,
concluded at the corner seat below the
Gangway the speech he had commenced by
the Front Cross Bench.
Business done.—Lord EGBERTS or KANDA-
HAR, championing the Forward Policy,
gets considerably " forrader."
House of Commons, Tuesday. — Haven't
seen much of late of the Turbulent
TOMLINSON. For statesmen of his par-
ticular bent these be evil days. His
ists are in Opposition, faced by Liberals
with a majority the smaller the better.
Then, TOMLINSON'S heroic figure swells
with patriotic passion. At briefest notice
he is good for an_hour's talk; more if it be
needed to hamper public business fallen
for awhile into hands of men of Belial.
With Conservative Ministry in, backed by
overwhelming majority, TOMLINSON'S occu-
pation is gone. The voice of Preston that
once through Westminster's halls the sound
of discord raised, is now mute as Ireland's
harp.
What TOMLINSON acutely feels is that
whilst he, a loyal Ministerialist, must per-
force remain silent when so much might
be said, his colleague, ex-Private HANBURY,
has not only got his stripes, but pay
amounting to £1,500 a year. More pre-
cious still, he enjoys, as to-night, the pri-
vilege of occasionally standing at table
and in Ministerial capacity making a
speech.
Probably it was this crowning incident
that wrought TOMLINSON beyond verge of
endurance of his vow of silence. Howbeit
he broke it. At commencement of sitting
House seemed foredoomed to customary
Tuesday count-out. But among notices of
motion was one raising question of griev-
ances of Government workmen. Work-
men in Government employ and elsewhere
have votes. Wouldn't do to ignore their
claim to be heard. S. WOODS, in charge of
motion, had little difficulty in engaging
attendance of quorum. Confidently awaited
his turn. There are more ways of killing
a hen than wringing its neck. Business
must needs close at midnight. If talk
kept up on preliminary subjects, motion
about workmen, inconvenient to a Govern-
ment that doesn't like to say "No," and
can't in this particular case say "Yes,"
might be shunted.
This was TOMLINSON'S opportunity.

intelligence that Russia is going to spend
nine and a half millions on building war-
ships. This evening, standing at table of
House of Commons, an elderly gentleman,
decently dressed in black, who looks more
like a City merchant than a sea-dog, quietly
makes a few proposals with respect to
British Navy involving an expenditure on
the current year of twenty-five and a half
millions.

and honour of the Empire, there it vas,
with plentv more where it came from. An
epoch night in history of Nation and

such preparation for war been forward. As
JOKIM mentioned, twenty-six yeara ago,
standing at the verv same place, then, as
now, First Lord of the Admiralty, :.e l.«d
proposed Navy Estimates for the year.
Thev footed up to nine and a half millions
sterling, and were thought pretty high.
To-day, they are twice and a half as much,
an increase piled up on steadily growing
expenditure during the last ten years.
Actual result is possession of a fleet more
than equal to the strength of any orobnble
combination of Foreign Powers. Tn a fine
phrase, JOKIM hit off situation. In oJdi-
tion to the Channel Sauadron, we h.ivp the
Australian Squadron, the Indian Squadron,
the Cape Squadron, and the China Squad-
ron, alwavs, in all circumstances, in full
force, at their appointed posts. As for the
wide water-ways of the Western Hemi-
sphere, "we," said JOKIM, "have squadrons
where other nations have isolated ships."
This fa magnificent; if need be, it is war.
Notable and admirable feature in night's
proceedings was total absence of cock-
crowing. Just plain business talk.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DARBY JONES ON THE GRAND NATIONAL.
HONOTJBED SIR,— There are nowadays
many High-Priced Contests on the Flat
which have in a measure diminished such
great Classic Events as the Guineas, the
Derby, and the Leger. But no enterpris-
ing Manager of a Gate-money Meeting has
ever succeeded in tarnishing the hall-
marked popularity of the Blue-Ribbon
Cross-Country battle at Aintree. There
is only one Grand National Steeplechase,
just as there is only one Oxford and Cam-
bridge Boat-race, one Eton and Harrow
cricket match, and one "Varsity ditto.
There is not a lot of " Fiddle Faddle" with
regard to "tests," as has been the case
over the substantial trouncings which
Messrs. STODDART & Co. have received in
the land of the limber kangaroo. No, Sir,
an owner lays himself out to win the
famous Liverpool prize, and if he be not
successful, he must reckon on putting an-
other twelve months between the Present
and the Future of his Ambition.
Perhaps the luckiest and pluckiest of
cavaliers was Lord MANNERS, when he de-
liberately announced that lie meant to cap-
ture the Stakes at first time of asking, and
did so, being himself in the pigskin on
Seaman. He was, I have been informed
by noble patrons, known as "Hoppy" at
Eton College. He certainly hopped over
the twigs in fine style on the occasion
referred to. But, on the other hand, there
are Ardent riders, who never attain the
Wished-for Goal. Year after year they
turn up, resolved to put the winning
bracket to their names; but the ill-omened
jade, Bad-Luck, is the animal on which
they are invariably mounted. They are
nevertheless a fearless cut-and-come-again
tribe, and, after defeat, generally console
themselves with the statement, "Well,
poor GEORGE FORDHAM didn't carry off the
Derby till he had given up all idea of
winning it." All Philosophers do not live
in tubs; a great many are more familial
with stable-buckets. One thing is certain,
that a rider on the Liverpool course can no
more take liberties with the obstacles than
can President KBTJGBR with the Right
Hon. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN. When some of
the Sandown Park heroes get on to the Lan-
cashire Arena, they feel, as the lamented
"RODDY" OWEN once observed, "like
fighting cocks who don't know their spurs
from their toes." Oh! it's a grand stretch
of country, and some of the Dot-and-go-
one Negotiators of the same would be none
the worse for an ounce or two of Cobbler's
Wax on the saddle. Yet again, a first-rate
horseman may, after four-fifths of the
journey have been accomplished, come a
Cruel Cropper through no fault of his, just
as he is about to rush into the outstretched
Arms of Victory, simply and solely because
some exhausted Quadruped may swerve,
collapse, and cause the Ruin of itself and
ita immediate follower. And sometimes,
honoured Sir, nocturnal Turtle Soup and
Punch, for which, in conjunction with
Ocean Liners and Ready-made Garments,
Liverpool is so justly celebrated, have
something to do with subsequent disaster.
But a truce to disquisitions on Cause
and Effect! Let me endeavour to solve the
Rebus of the Day; no light matter, I can
assure you and my clients. I make no
doubt, honoured Sir, that you have read
of, in your time, and possibly seen, Pro-
phetesses who under Mesmeric Influence

RESEARCHES IN ANCIENT SPORTS.
A LITTLE SPIN AT A SKATING RlNK.
LITERARY TOUTS.
I.—PLAIN WORDS WITH A BLUE.
IN view of the approaching contest be-
tween the rival wearers of the coerulean, a
representative of the Chronic Adviser ex-
tended the privilege of an interview to a
delegate from one of the antagonistic fac-
tions. It was with No. 22A of the Oxtab
crew that he entered into conversation,
at the exact moment when that stalwart
young figure was stepping into his craft
preparatory to indulging in a spin between
bridges. It may be of interest to mention
that he stands 5.10J in his shooting-boots,
while hi his Turkish Bath he weighs 12
stone, 10.3 Ibs., the last decimal repeating
when his lungs are extended to their full
capacity.
"And what are your plans with regard to
the great event?" inquired the Chronic
Adviser man.
"Our primary purpose," replied the
young oarsman, with a singularly courteous
and unaffected intonation, " is to anticipate
our rivals at the winning-post. All other
considerations pale before this. As to the
exact margin by which we gain the judge's
verdict, we are not equally fastidious.
No, you are quite wrong about the toast-
and-water theory. We have jam for
breakfast twice a week and meat on Sun-
days. I say nothing of iced pudding after
a full course on the flood."
"Does not the time hang heavy upon
you in your enforced retirement from aca-
demical pursuits?"
A frank smile flitted across the open
countenance of No. 22A. "Well," he said,
"of course we miss that indefinable atmos-
phere which plays round the presence of
the college tutor; but we make shift to
survive without it. We have a sharp game
of croquet on the back-lawn before break-
fast. Then, in the intervals of negotiating
the course, we try to improve ourselves by
reading the criticisms in your Chronic
Adviser. Nay, do not blush," he added,
reassuringly. "We like to know how
others see us. It is so difficult to judge
one has his back turned to somebody else.
Proximity, again, destroys the perspec-
tive. Then we have a little round of
Poker or Loo to steady ourselves before
dinner; and after dinner our coach, the
McFLETCH, gives us readings from BROWN-
ING. Then we go to sleep."
"Mens sana in corpore sano, eh?"
"You have hit it exactly in HOMER'S
words. But, in reply to the question which
you are going to ask, oh! yes, we are on
the friendliest terms with our so-called
opponents. We often go and stay at one
another's houses, borrow one another's
flannels, and occasionally exchange cox-
swains. Ah! to be sure, you want to
know about the coxswains — how we
manage to keep them so small? Well,
between you and me and the tiller, it's
gi:i that does it; gin and blood-letting.
Our man goes to bed every night with
a leech on each calf, and two on the
bulge of his biceps. But of course, if
a cox. is in hopeless love, that's the best
emaciator. How does HORACE put it? 0
quam me macerat Susanna proterva!"
(Murmurs of recognition from the Chronic
Adviser man.) ''But," added No. 22A,
"this system has its drawbacks. At times
it tends to distract them from their duties.
I have known a cox. take his crew through
the wrong arch of Hammersmith Bridge
simply because he saw his False Love wav-
ing a parasol of the wrong tint from the
summit of that structure."
"I suppose you are very strict about
keeping regulations when actually in the
boat ? ff
"Particularly so during the race. All
conversation, even the most pleasantly
humorous, is discouraged. I do not, of
course, include under this head those inter-
changes of courtesy which are common
between the rival helmsmen when each is
trying to bore the other on to the "flats,"
or one of the adjacent banks. In these cir-
cumstances a lot of latitude is allowed—
and employed. But they always embrace
with tears later on at Mortlake. What I
rather mean is that we discountenance the
natural tendency of the active members of
of the enemy, or the relative magnitude
of the crowds as compared with former
years."
"I think I am right in saying that you
have taken part in this little affair on a
previous occasion? What, if it is not rude
to ask, are your feelings during the con-
test?"
"As far as Harrod's Chimney," he re-
plied, with an evident straining after truth-
fulness, "I remarked to myself what a
splendid exercise rowing was for the de-
velopment of a perfect physique. From
there to Thornycroft's I regarded it as an
overrated amusement. All along Chiswick
Eyot I overheard myself saying the Kings
of Israel backward. By Barnes Bridge 1
remembered that I had forgotten to wind
my watch up the night before, and wanted
to get out and rectify the omission. From
there to the finish my past career went in
rapid review before1 my partially-closed
eyes. No, I do not think that the necessity
of getting an appetite for the subsequent
banquet by good hard work is ever a
strongly actuating influence during the
race. I say this after taking the consensus
of a large body of old University oarsmen,
many of them bishops and members of the
Stock Exchange."
"I would thank you to give me your
opinion about stateness. It is, I under-
stand, an undesirable condition."
"Frankly, you are right. And it is
peculiarly deplorable on the day of the
race. When you see men strip at the
stake-boat with evident lassitude, or other
signs of ennui, it is most discouraging to
their well-wishers. Nothing can be more
intolerably boring that a four-mile course
when your heart is not in the work. The
sameness of things, the similarity of one
stroke to another, reiterated as they are
through an appreciable fraction of an hour,
reminds one of that continual dropping
which a person in the Pentateuch—was it
not P—so strongly deprecated."
"One more word. Do you consider that
weight tells in the long run?"
"Mere tonnage, though always a source
of dignity, is not so important as is popu-
for oneself, in a boat where nearly every
larly supposed. What you want is more

horse-power to your elbow. Remember
that the crew, if they are good watermen,
are always inside the boat: they do not
propel it, so to speak, exoterically. You
follow me? Consequently, a child may see
that they, as well as the boat, have some-
how to be conveyed to their destination.
If, therefore, you could get a crew 'whose
weight might be neglected,' but possessed
of an elephantine power of propulsion, it
should go far towards doing a peerless
performance. And now," he concluded,
for my colleagues grow restless, and the
winged curses of my coach are already
audible through the medium of the phono-
blast, you will please release me from
further inquisition." And jauntily assum-
ing his seat on No. 22x thwart, and waving

at the rate of 9} strokes in the first 151

SPORTIVE SONGS.
A Gentleman, icell stricken in years, visits a spot
inhere he had, in his youth, a love passage with,
a fair French lady.
SOMEWHERE down in the good South-West,
Where England kisses her Channel Sea,
Where the wave may tumble with frothy
crest,
Or laugh like a lady with rippling glee,
Where the storm-fiend sweeps with a bittei
laugh
On the rolling platform, when sunbeams
c"ance,
And scatters the sand from the seaweed
chaff,
I stand on the cliff and I look to France!
Somewhere down in the good South-West,
Where the air is fragrant with scent of
pine,
That of all scent is richest, best,
The reek of the dripping turpentine I
Think me not vulgar to sing its praise,

I.—PLAIN WORDS WITH A BLUE.
IN view of the approaching contest be-
tween the rival wearers of the coerulean, a
representative of the Chronic Adviser ex-
tended the privilege of an interview to a
delegate from one of the antagonistic fac-
tions. It was with No. 22A of tho Oxtab
crew that he entered into conversation,
at the exact moment when that stalwart
young figure was stepping into his craft
preparatory to indulging in a spin between
bridges. It may be of interest to mention
that he stands 5.10} in his shooting-boots,
while hi his Turkish Bath he weighs 12
stone, 10.3 Ibs., the last decimal repeating
when his lungs are extended to their full
capacity.
"And what are your plans with regard to
the great event?" inquired the Chronic
Adviser man.
"Our primary purpose," replied the
young oarsman, with a singularly courteous
and unaffected intonation, " is to anticipate
our rivals at the winning-post. AH other
considerations pale before this. As to the
exact margin by which we gain the judge's
verdict, we are not equally fastidious.
No, you are quite wrong about the toast-
and-water theory. We have jam for
breakfast twice a week and meat on Sun-
days. I say nothing of iced pudding after
a full course on the flood."
"Does not the time hang heavy upon
you in your enforced retirement from aca-
demical pursuits P"
A frank smile flitted across the open
countenance of No. 22A. "Well," he said,
"of course we miss that indefinable atmos-
phere which plays round the presence of
the college tutor; but we make shift to
survive without it. We have a sharp game
of croquet on the back-lawn before break-
fast. Then, in the intervals of negotiating
the course, we try to improve ourselves by
reading the criticisms in your Chronic
Adviser. Nay, do not blush," he added,
reassuringly. "We like to know how
others see us. It is so difficult to judge
one has his back turned to somebody else.
Proximity, again, destroys the perspec-
tive. Then we have a little round of
Poker or Loo to steady ourselves before
dinner; and after dinner our coach, the
McFLETCH, gives us readings from BBOWN-
INO. Then we go to sleep."
"Mens sana in corpore sano, eh?"
"You have hit it exactly in HOMER'S
words. But, in reply to the question which
you are going to ask, oh! yes, we are on
the friendliest terms with our so-callad
opponents. We often go and stay at one
another's houses, borrow one another's
flannels, and occasionally exchange cox-
swains. Ah I to be sure, you want to
know about the coxswains — how we
manage to keep them so small P Well,
between you and me and the tiller, it's
giu that does it; gin and blood-letting.
Our man goes to bed every night with
a leech on each calf, and two on the
bulge of his biceps. But of course, if
a cox. is in hopeless love, that's the best
emaciator. How does HORACE put it? 0
quam me macerat Susanna proterva!"
(Murmurs of recognition from the Chronic
Adviser man.) 5'But," added No. 22A,
"this system has its drawbacks. At times
it tends to distract them from their duties.
I have known a cox. take his crew through
the wrong arch of Hammersmith Bridge
simply because he saw his False Love wav-
ing a parasol of the wrong tint from the
summit of that structure."
"I suppose you are very strict about
keeping regulations when actually in the
boat?"
"Particularly so during the race. All
conversation, even the most pleasantly
humorous, is discouraged. I do not, of
course, include under this head those inter-
changes of courtesy which are common
between the rival helmsmen when each is
trying to bore the other on to the "flats,"
or one of the adjacent banks. In these cir-
cumstances a lot of latitude is allowed—
and employed. But they always embrace
with tears later on at Mortlake. What I
rather mean is that we discountenance the
natural tendency of the active members of
of the enemy, or the relative magnitude
of the crowds as compared with former
years."
"I think I am right in saying that you
have taken part in this little affair on a
previous occasion? What, if it is not rude
to ask, are your feelings during the con-
test?"
"As far as Harrod's Chimney," he re-
plied, with an evident straining after truth-
fulness, "I remarked to myself what a
splendid exercise rowing was for the de-
velopment of a perfect physique. From
there to Thornycroft's I regarded it as an
overrated amusement. All along Chfawick
Eyot I overheard myself saying the Kings
of Israel backward. By Barnes Bridge 1
remembered that I had forgotten to wind
my watch up the night before, and wanted
to get out and rectify the omission. From
there to the finish my past career went in
rapid review before my partially-closed
eyes. No, I do not think that the necessity
of getting an appetite for the subsequent
banquet by good hard work is ever a
strongly actuating influence during the
race. I say this after taking the consensus
of a large body of old University oarsmen,
many of them bishops and members of the
Stock Exchange."
"I would thank you to give me your
opinion about stateness. It is, I under-
stand, an undesirable condition."
"Frankly, you are right. And it is
peculiarly deplorable on the day of the
race. When you see men strip at the
stake-boat with evident lassitude, or other
signs of ennui, it is most discouraging to
their well-wishers. Nothing can be more
intolerably boring that a four-mile course
when your heart is not in the work. The
sameness of things, the similarity of one
stroke to another, reiterated as they are
through an appreciable fraction of an hour,
reminds one of that continual dropping
which a person in the Pentateuch—was it
not P—so strongly deprecated."
"One more word. Do you consider that
weight tells in the long run?"
"Mere tonnage, though always a source
of dignity, is not so important as is popu-
for oneself, in a boat where nearly every
larly supposed. What you want is more

that the crew, if they are good watermen,
are always inside the boat: they do iiot
propel it, so to speak, exoterically. You
follow me? Consequently, a child may see
that they, as well as the boat, have some-
how to be conveyed to their destination.
If, therefore, you could get a crew 'whose
weight might be neglected ' but possessed
of an elephantine power or propulsion, it
should go far towards doing a peerless
performance. And now," he concluded,
'for my colleagues grow restless, and the
winged curses of my coach are already

THE EACE IN ADVANCE.
(An Article satisfying the Exigencies of the
Situation.)
SATURDAY, March 26; opened with the
Bun shining, the birds singing, and all na-
ture rejoicing in the approach of Spring.
The day was dull and bleak, and the
wintry wind swept the reaches of the rivet
from shore to shore like the laah of the
storm-fiend. The ladies were clad in the
lightest raiment; muslin and chiffon ruled
supreme; and many a dainty complexion
was saved from the sultry rays of the God
of Day by the lace-covered en-tovt-cas.
Furs and umbrellas were much in evidence,
! ance. Such was the scene on the banks. On
i the river itself were crowds of every de-
scription, from the craft of yesterday to the
skiff of the day after to-morrow. Father
Thames never looked brighter—he was en-
joying his holiday. It was natural, indeed,
j that the great silent highway should be all
but deserted in such weather. What plea-
sure could be obtained in sleet and snow?
The mighty audience that usually acclaimed
: the rival crews was conspicuous by its
: absence.
Who does not know the scene of the
race? It has been told by a score of
tongues, and the contest of 1898 differed in
nothing essential from its predecessors.
The dark blues led from start to finish, and
sion. Yes, it certainly was a triumph for
the Cam. A well-fought fight from Putney
to Barnes. There was little to choose
between the rivals, but as the signal was
given all England—nay, all the world—
knew that the laurel wreath was to the
Athletes of the Azure.
And so it ended. Well may those who
love " the House" or can boast of "Uny,"
cheer to the echo. Well may they shout
for Oxford—grand old Oxford. The battle
is over, and the dark blue flag once again
appears above the other on the piers of
the Thames Conservancy. Well may Tri-
nity and the Hall be proud of their achiev-
ments. Well may they toast the Granta
and cheer the A. D. C. Cambridge is her-
self again. She has wrested back from the

THE reading world, more particularly those interested in politi-

WILLIAM, grandfather of Lady GREGORY'S husband, was for
eighteen of those years Under-Secretary for Ireland. In that
capacity he came in personal contact or correspondence with most
if the statesmen of the day. His letters to them and theirs to
urn, hidden away for more than half a century in this old box,
irow vivid side-lights on the history of the time. In Mr.

his contemporary Gracious Majesty King Louis of France were
mere amateurs in a repulsive trade which, in this matter-of-facl
and highly moral "so-called" nineteenth century, would have
landed them (had they not been royalties) and their agents (who
would of course have been disowned by their employers) in the
dock at Bow Street or in the nearest police-court. Temporc

puritanism of Old NOLL. Mr. ANTHONY HOPE'crowds his can-
vass, but contrives to sustain the reader's interest in his hero,
who is a bit of a fool, and in his heroine, who in some respects
may call to mind THACKERAY'S Beatrice, and Sir WALTER'S
Alice, in Woodstock. Yet the author contrives to touch us by
working on our sneaking kindness towards the vulgar orange-
girl, Duchess of St. Albans, the very human and soft-hearted
NELL G WYNNE, "the Protestant (word unmentionable to ears
polite)," as it is historically recorded she styled herself when
facing the mob. In this fancy portrait of NELL is the pith of the
book. It is the glorification of NELL and not the fortunes oJ
Simon and Barbara that will " catch on." There are not a few
strikingly melo-dramatic situations, of which the most daringly-
devised is when, at their wits' end in a boat, Simon parts with a
Louis, and is thereby reduced to his last guinea. But the pret-
tiest and most touching passage in the whole book is to be found
in the commencement of the last chapter; and fully to appreciate
this, it is essential to read the whole romance from beginning to
end says THE BARON DE B.-W.

ONE of the blessings of an advanced civilisation is the "nigger"
song. To write an efficient "nigger" song, take the word "coon,"
repeat it a good many times, combine it with " honey," add the
moon and stars, and spell to taste. "Alabama," "Mississippi,"
"Carolina," "banjo," and about twenty other words may be used

DEAR MK. PUNCH,—I gather from the
newspapers that there has been consider-
able commotion with regard to that impos-
ing edifice the Grosvenor Hotel, situated
on what has been justly described as one
of the finest sites in London. With this
quarrel I hare nothing to do, being a total
abstainer—from company strife; but I do
venture to draw your attention, and that
of the authorities as may be, to die dis-
reputable yard adjacent, wherein cabs,
omnibuses, and other vehicles assemble, to
collect and distribute passengers by two
important lines of railway. Surrounded by
wretched wooden palings resembling those
of the primeval village-pound, this inclosure
reeks with possible accidents, and is satu-
rated with probable collisions. It is an
eye and by-way sore in the midst of West-
End traffic, a back-to-date memorial of the
infancy of travel, in short, a disgrace to
circulating civilisation.
Compare this pernicious pen (no, Sir,
I am writing with the best broad-nibbed
quill—"pen" having more meanings than
one, you '11 observe) with the well-arranged
court at Charing Cross, or the cleanly
and well-arranged approaches to Waterloo,
Paddington, Liverpool Street, Euston or
St. Pancras, or even round the corner at
the fairly-roomy entrance of the L. C. &
D. station, and you have the difference
between confusion and compact order. In
hansom or on foot the voyager hieing to
Victoria Station runs a risk not discounted
by the fact that he has in his pocket a
weekly periodical assigning £1,000 to his
nearest relatives by reason of sudden de-
mise.

THE DIARY OF A NINE-DAYS' WONDER.
Fint Day.—A letter appears in a daily
paper, say, calling attention to a case of
alleged ill-treatment of a feudatory popula-
tion by the authorities of the suzerain.
The journal (being short of subjects) deals
with the matter in a ten-line editorial.
Second Day.—Six letters appear in the
daily in support of the original epistle,
and the affair is discussed in a leading
article. The question is touched upon in
more than one of the evening papers.
Third Day.—The entire press, Metro-
politan and Provincial, full of the alleged
ill-treatment. Special telegraphic intelli-
gence relative to the "outrage" wired by
an important news agency. The matter
discussed at nine-tenths of the dinner-
tables of London.
Fourth Day.-^-Question in the House
followed by Ministerial explanation. Late
dissatisfaction, and arrangements for pub-
lic meetings in various parts of the king-
dom completed.
Fifth Day.—Popular assemblies every-
where. Mass meeting in Hyde Park. All
the light musical pieces provided with
topical song and encore verses on the
subject. The matter engrosses the atten-
tion of the nation to the exclusion of
everything else.
Sixth Day.—The contents bills full of it.
Movement of fleets and armies given, ac-
companied by press interpretation. The
City begins to take notice of the topic,
and bulls and bears prepare for a contest.
Seventh Day.— Fall in Consols. All the
Bourses in Europe affected. Crisis in the
City. Full-dress debate in the House of
Lords, and the fate of the Ministry in the
balance. All domestic matters neglected,
that undivided attention may be given to
the consideration of the great topic of the
hour.
Eighth Day.—Matter begins to wane to
importance. Some of the papers give it
only half a column, and others merely a
side-headed paragraph of a dozen lines.
City regains composure. Topic voted stale
at the dinner-tables. Encore verses in the
topical songs cancelled.
Ninth Day.—End of the boom. No
comment of any sort in the pres»,
with a solitary exception. Sub-editor
at the last moment "shovels in" a letter
that has been standing over for some days,
to the disgust of his chief. Reclamations

of office. He resented that by '' going for"
the wrong man, pursuing with relentless
animosity a colleague of Mr. G.'s, who had
no more to do with his just disappointment
than had the Member for Sark. That an
exception to his ordinary habit. Usually,
being of philosophic mind, prone to cyni-
cism, he bears things and grins.
One exception, beyond his belated attack
on Lord ROSEBERY, is the spectacle of the
two Front Benches supporting each other.
That is a trial against which his habi-
tual equanimity is not proof. To-night he
broke forth in burst of scolding that startled
the House. COLONIAL SECRETARY, his
heart touched by the sorrows of St. Vincent
and the dolours of Dominica, proposed, out
of his great bounty, to relieve them at
expense of British taxpayer. That beast
of burden has of late grown so inured to
giving doles that he might have been ex-
pected to plump down this comparatively
small sum without a murmur. SAGE OF

they came back they found the SAGE wait-

it in the Division Lobby; whereas, as
usual, occupants of Front Opposition Bench

genuine was the mirth on opposite benches,
whence this fresh evidence of division in
the camp of the enemy was fair to see.

watching CAWMELL-BANNERMAN talking
round the Home Rule Question, "H. C. B.

when you put it in button-hole or caubeen
is to wither, presenting shrivelled-up ap-
pearance that is neither decorative nor
inspiriting."
Something in this, at least as far as
London is concerned. In Westmeath the
shamrock may remain defiantly fresh
through the lengthening March day. At
Westminster it straightway shrivels up at

THE man crept away from the house.
T'H- moon was shining brightly, and he did
his best to avoid detection. He carried
with him a bag containing the results of
his expedition in spoons, candlesticks and
tea-pots.
"Stop!"
Yes, he was arrested. There waa no
escape. The constable blew hia whistle,
and an excited crowd gathered around.
"Ladies and gentlemen," said the con-

wants shall receive attention."
"And you shall be photographed, and
the statue waiting with a face blank in
the market-place shall receive the finishing
touch of your portrait." This came from
the Lord Lieutenant of the county.
Then there was organised a procession.
Headed by flags and bands of music, the
hero of the hour was escorted to the Town
Hall. The cheering was deafening.
A few hours later a goodly company
assembled in the banqueting saloon. There
had been a splendid luncheon, and the
customary toasts had been drunk with
enthusiasm.
"Ladies and gentlemen," said the Mayor,
who presided, "I now come to the speech
of the day. The health of our gueat—may
he live long to enjoy the honours we confer
upon him."
Then came a mighty burst of cheering
which shook the building to its foundation.
"But I say, guv'nor," whispered the
hero to his neighbour, the police-constable
who had arrested him, why are they
making all this fuss about me?"
"Don't you know?" was the response.
"Why, go along with you!"

DEAR MB. PUNCH,— Yep-ho and ahoyl
If this ever reaches you, it is to tell you
that the very good ship Triton (this is
within a cable's length of her name) has
been at sea for just a fortnight, bound for
the Cape on her second trip. She bears on
board about a thousand souls all told, five
horses, a couple of cows, two or three
parrots, of third-class behaviour, and a few
canaries, which have not as yet taken
berths inside the ship's cat.
We left Southampton on an even keel,
but there were plenty of French rolls for
breakfast next morning in the Bay of
Biscay, so we were aegrotat (sic) for the
rest of the day in such seclusion as our
cabin granted. The next event of import-
ance was Madeira. Here we had about
four hours in which to watch the natives
(one of them a one-armed boy) diving
for our spare coppers, to breakfast on
shore, to do the sights of Funchal, to buy
deck-chairs, if not whole drawing-room
mites, of wickerwork, to visit Santa Clara
and the other suburban resorts, and, most
necessary of all, to ascend by the new
mountain railway to the church of Nossa
Senhora de Monte, and then to descend
two thousand feet by earro, or toboggan
lot to do, but we did it on our heads—
especially the last-named athletic per-
formance. Our steersman, MANVKL, cer-
tainly deserved his pint of Madeira at the
"Half-way House for his agility and
dexterity in taking us down a decline of
one in two, past corkscrew corners, and
hordes of beggars.
English money seems to be quite the
medium of currency at Funchal, and Eng-
lish is spoken by the enterprising islanders
while you wait (or until your last shilling
is spent). Even a tea-garden sort of place
is dignified by the name of " Earl's Court,"
to attract and solace the homesick Lon-
doner. Meanwhile, it was market-day on
board the ship, and great was the company
of merchants with all kinds of wares.
These are bundled off neck and crop by
11 A.M., and we settled down to the &;rious
business of the voyage—the election of a
Sports and Entertainment Committee, the
consumption of six meals a day, the daily
sweepstakes and auction on the run, the
dissection of everybody's character, and the
other inevitable humours and incidents ot
an ocean trip.
We fetched a compass, or whatever the
nautical pkrase is, round the Canaries in
a sea-fog, for fear of running up against
Teneriffe, and since then we haven't
lighted land, nor seen a ship, or even a
whale or waterspout, nothing more ex-
citing than a few coveys of flying-fish,
and, I think, half a dozen porpoises. At

crossed the line without feeling the slightest
bump. We have passed through the

One of a large theatrical company was
quite unrecognisable as Sheffield's Ape,

busy restoring himself to human form.
The captain's clerk appeared in a series ot
quick-turn changes, such as a comio suitor

doctor contributed an awe-inspiring im-
personation of Old Moore or somebody in
the wizard profession.
The sports and other entertainments
have passed off without bloodshed. Our
captain; a breezy, jovial Irishman, received
the ladies with open arms at the finish of
their fifty yards race, and the comedians
who performed in "Are you there?" and
the other humorous items fully rose, or
tumbled, to the occasion, as the case might
be. Take it all round, we have had a
particularly good time of it. Pleasant
company and pleasant weather. Out of

face with the ocean.

ACCURACY ABOVE ALL.
Jfn. Orosslcy (at a "Private Viea"). "REALLY, YOU GIRLS HAVE NO MEMORIES AT ALL. OF COURSE IT'S WHAT'S-HIS-NAME RESCUING
WHO-DO-YOU-CALL-IT FROM—OH, YOU KNOW—AT THE SIEOE OF THAT PLACE."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
in the Nineteenth Century (SMITH, ELDER) is an uttructivo-
looking book with an excellent map. But the belated reader
soon discovers that its author, Mr. CAMERON, lacks the gift of
lucidity. He is choke-full of his subject, and is prone to splutter
it forth in bewildering fashion. My Baronite, diligently pur-
suing the thread of the narrative, occasionally found himself in
Syria when he thought he was in Egypt, or reading about
11 in A HA M I 'AW i A when it really was his fat her, MEHEMET AI.I ,
who was referred to. One thing at least conies out clear from
the muddle. It is that of all the services England has incidentally
done to humanity by extension of her empire, nothing surpasses
the wonder wrought in Egypt. The condition alike of the finances
and the fellaheen, as compared with what they were in the time
of M KI i EM ET A LI or of ISMAIL PACHA, e x eeods any transformation
fabled in the Arabian Nightt.
Mr. FISHER UN WIN has commenced the publication of a com-
plete set of the Waverley novels under the title "The Century
Scott." For my Baronite the type is a little small, but it is
beautifully clear, printed on good paper, daintily bound, and all
for a shilling. Them as is rich and rides in chaises may plank
down half-a-crown, and have it bound in leather.
The commencement of GRANT ALLEN'S Incidental Bithop
(PEARSON Limited) is excellent as an exciting prologue to a story
that ought to have been an amusing comedy of farcical errors
with a nappy solution. The Incidental Bishop is anything but
this; and the possibility of the tale is destroyed by fixe glaring
character of the improbabilities. Better would it have been had
Mr. GRANT AT.LKN followed in brevity the example of the late
Captain MARRYAT'S Mr. Chuckt, the boatswain, whose story of
his own life, as told to young Peter Simple (Ch. XTV.) is so closely
analogous to that of The Incidental Bithop, that, at first sight, it
one, and had simply substituted Tom Pringle for " Mr. Chuckt,"
and the missionary for "Lord A ." In MARRYAT'S novel
Mr. Chuckt puts on his lordship's clothes, his lordship having
died at sea, and is welcomed everywhere as "my lord," while, in
GRANT ALLEN'S, Tom Pringle puts on the missionary's clothes,
the reverend gentleman dying at sea, and after being received
everywhere as an Anglican clergyman, a bishopric is conferred on
him. MARRYAT'S Mr. Chuckt is ultimately hauled up at Bow
Street, and commences life again on board ship: ALLEN'S Tom
Pringle dies a pseudo-bishop, and his fraud is never discovered.
Captain HAKKYAT'S story has the advantage over Mr. GRANT
ALLEN'S of being told in seven pages, whereas the latter occupies
two hundred and forty-eight, and, with the exception of the
prologue about the slave-trader, I must own to a preference for
the shorter treatment of the original idea.
It is curious that Captain MARKYAT (of whose collected works
a delightfully readable edition has recently been published by
DENT & Co.) should, on two occasions in the same novel,
have made one of his minor heroes, the Mr. Chuckt above-men-
tioned, avail himself of the device of appropriating somebody
else's clothes, and then adopting the name of the deceased wearer.
The ruling passion of wishing to bear a title and dress as a
gentleman was too strong for Mr. Chuckt, and, in his second
attempt, he succeeded! No doubt Captain MARRYAT, as a nauti-
cal novelist, excused himself to himself for the repetition of
"the means," seeing that, on repetition, they were justified
by "the end" achieved. Wanted, a MARRYAT of the present
day to give us a racy nautical novel, descriptive of life aboard the
huge armour-plated turret ships and such-like modern fighting
monsters of the deep. Pity Lord CHARLES BERESFORD hasn't a
novelistic twist. One good Marryat-like novel would do more
good to the cause that his lordship has at heart than a hundred
would seem as if the modern author owed his inspiration to the older
speeches, be they reported never so widely. THE BARON DE B.-W.

AFFECTIONATE FURNITURE.
SlH,—As a Philosopher it has always struck me that appa-
rently inanimate objects possess affections. Arm-chairs have
probably deep-seated feelings. I was struck by this advertise-
ment in the Times, " Nutice.~Wa.il Papers like Old Silks." Do
they? I trust that the sentiment is reciprocal, and that "Old
Silks like Wall Papers." I am aware that "Old Silks" may
mean " Old Queen's Counsel," but why should they like "Wall
Papers"? No, I prefer to take it literally as proving my
theory. Inanimate objects have their likes and dislikes. The
humble chair does not mind being "sat on." A hat may hang
fondly on its own dear little " Peg." An ill-used sofa, oppressed
by its burdens, may exclaim with Falstaff, "Lord! how this
world is given to lying." A book may feel itself a prisoner when
it is bound. In this respect, the club entitled " Ye Sette of Odde
Volumes" will supply many instances. How many an appa-
rently " easy chair could, an' it chose, write "The Sorrows of
Sat-inI"" Yours, X. CATHEDKA.
IN the Daily Telsgraphjeport of the Grosvenor Hotel inquiry,
March 25, we read:
"Mr. Justice BRCCE and a common jury, of] whom no loss than seven
answered to the name of SMITH, had before them yesterday a further develop-
ment," &c.
What! call this a "Common Jury "! A moat •" Uncommon
Jury," as, despite the fact that a considerable proportion of the
great SMITH tribe are, like the poor, "always with us," it is rare
to find in a select company of twelve, seven out of the number,
not related in any way to one another, answering to the name of
SMITH. It is a record. Pity the case was not before Mr.
Justice A. L. SMITH.
LOST !—A Voice, after a severe attack of influenza. Its owner
remembers having dropped hu voice while injudiciously stopping
to talk to a friend at the corner of Park Lane. He will be glad
to recover it as soon as possible, as it can be of no possible use
to any one else. The finder, on forwarding it to "Vox et
Praeterea Nil," at this office, will be handsomely rewarded.

THE WOMAN WITH THE DEAD CERT.
(With the Authors admiring regards to hisfriend,
Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPS, Academy Coronee.)
ENTRANCED by the soul-captivating light,
Red, green and sapphirine, piercing the
night,
From bulbous bottles in a mooneVl row,
Through the' chemist's and druggist's shop-
door, lo!
I passed. Without, a terrier, & dumb thing,
Draws his blind master attached by a string,
Straining. He was so strong almost I wept,
Wondering how the patient beggar kept
Up. Thinly from a far Teutonic band
Soldier* of tM Queen floated down the
Strand. te
And lo I along the ardent street,
The usual average of feet,
Braving the clotted traffic's tide*
In buttons or elastic sides!
And I was 'ware how one in baste
Went by with both his boots unlaced!
Across the road, outside a bar,
A dull mechanic motor-car
Stood uncomplaining while within
Its driver slowly swallowed gin.
With shame my human fibres shook
At this significant rebuke;
Right in my heart I felt the stab
Dealt by the mute electric cab.
So to the counter warily I drew
And hailed the chemist: "I will trouble
you
For some Miltonitm troches, if you please,
Which to the voice give comfortable ease,
When, mellifluously it would rehearse
And even as I spake, oh, lo! I saw
A woman sipping sal volatile, raw,
Out of a test-tube. Her sinister eye,
That shone like a bay-window dreadfully,
Was furnished with an infelicitous cast
Such as I deemed should indicate a past
Disillusioned. A nice, funereal plume
Lent to her hat a quiet touch of gloom.
Partly for ruth no word I found to say,
And partly since a truant troche lay
Athwart my throat. At length the silence
stirred,
As when in the' green dark an early bird
Twitters. Her tale she told without re-
serve;
Keenly I re'member her placid nerve.
She had, when life was full of tranquil
hay,
A beloved husband, by profession a
Dynamiter. Most proud indeed was she
Of his infernal ingenuity.
It chanced a public edifice was blown
To bits, with people in it. Cause was
shewn
None; but a paltry furlong thence they
came
Upon the artist's collar, with his name
And blood thereon. But of the rest of him
Not so much as a fragmentary limb
Anywhere found they. Th4 Coro'ner said
That the deceased had merely saved his
head
By an alibi. So in weeds she went,
Doubtful at first, but growing confident
As one that hath a dead cert. By-and-by
After a lustre of celibacy
She married with a publican and drew
Beer at his bar; nor even so much as knew
Who Mrs. ABDKN was.
She serving liquors, lo 1 there chanced that
way
A lurid reveller of familiar mould,
Dight in a massive chain of Yukon gold;
And on her first husband, before she wist,
Swooned heavily the conscious bigamist!
Anon the police held their man in thrall;
And, ere the second moon's full coronal
Came round, from the scaffold, clean-shaved
and cropped,
Sated, arranged, deliberate, he dropped,
Leaving a sullied widow; yea, and lone,
That should be; for they whispered he had
gone,
Her second mate, that morning, being wed
With the barmaid. This also was a dead
Cert. Here her welling tears that might
not dry
Fell in the test-tube very bitterly.
Therewith the chemist, having overheard,
Sobbed like a babe. The motor-cab,
referred
To in a previous passage, moved about
Involuntarily; and lo! tbo shout
Raucous-insistent of the Specials broke
The stilly mud-blue nocturne; and I spoke.
Pitiful words I spoke that filtered through
Her arid feelings as the divine dew
Freshens Sahara. In the mirror she
Ordered her gear. The sal volatile
I paid for, with the troches, nett; and so
Moving with rhythmic step, composed and
slow,
Into the large, elusive night I glide
With that strange woman, my affianced
bride!

To give it over to the builders and lay out the grounds into
two-acre-sized gardens of desirable suburban residences.
To open it as a Park for the People, with the possible result
of finding it practically deserted after the novelty has worn off.
Lastly (and possibly the best), to face the situation cheerfully,
improve the train service, improve (if practicable) the entertain-
ments, improve, in fact, everything, and with renewed energy
make the institution a brilliant success.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, H.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 21.—
"Here endeth the First Lesson." When,
just now, LECKY sat down after supporting
second reading of Irish Local Government
Bill, the ear was strained to catch this
familiar announcement. So complete the
illusion, as the voice rose and fell with
pulpit cadence, that J. G. TALBOT, pulling
himself together with guilty start, not
quite sure he hadn't been dozing off,
hurriedly turned over the pages of Orders
of the Day, as if it were a folio prayer-
book, and he in search of the next portion
of the Morning Service. The eye helped
to deceive the ear. Looking across at the
Member for Dublin University, with hie
folded hands, his head held a little on one
side in meek depression, a seraphic smile
occasionally lighting up his saintly coun-
tenance, there lacked only a little of BURNE
JONES'S colour and sunlight shining
through him, to realise the effect of a
painted and consecrated window in some
solemn aisle.
Picturesque, but not practicable, and, in
the main, a pity. House of Commons
always ready to sit at feet of historian of
England in the Eighteenth Century, and bid
him discourse. But in his solicitude for
the improvement of European Morals from
AUGUSTUS to CHARLEMAGNE, he should
avoid the pulpit voice and manner. Hap-
pily they are not inseparable from his
House of Commons speech. House remem-
bers with pleasure the success of one of his
earliest deliverances, when he unexpectedly
came to assistance of HORACE PLUNKETT
in pleading for amnesty. SARK says the
variety of the two circumstances explains
the difference of style. The first speech
was delivered on spur of moment. He just
talked to House in musical voice out of full


'Arry (whose "Old Dutch" lias been shopping, and has kept Mm wailing'a considerable time).

knowledge and kindly heart. To-night
brought down notes of convincing oration
that should equal his reputation. Having
his sermon written, he instinctively intoned
it.
Business done.—Irish Local Government
Bill read a second time.
Tuesday.—Quite exciting scene between
MICHAEL JOSEPH FLAVIN, Esq., Member
for North Kerry, and the Eight Hon. the
SPEAKER. Ostensible business of House
second reading of Consolidated Fund Bill.
Really might oe supposed in advance that
this would not suggest debate about Ireland.
Such supposition only betrays ignorance of
resources of Irish ingenuity. The Fund
including Ireland in its dispensation, Irish
matters might be talked about. If JOHN
CODLIN DILLON didn't make a speech,
JOHN SHORT BEDMOND might; and what
would they say in Ireland? An anxious
moment whilst question that Bill be read a
second time put from Chair. Was JOHN
would he catch the SPEAKER'S eye before
JOHN CODLIN grasped the optic? Fortune
favoured J. C., and before the amazed
House quite knew where it was, he had
embarked on a long speech about distress
in Ireland.
Though Members generally ignorant of
what was to the fore, MICHAEL JOSEPH
had received the tip. In the quiet recesses
of his library he had composed a prodigious
speech. Brought it down secreted about
his person upon innumerable sheets of
paper. At critical moments these got
mixed, and there were long pauses whilst
MICHAEL rearranged the folios.
After one of the pauses the bull appeared
on scene. Like the birth of Jearnes, its
origin is "wropped in mystery." SARK
says he believes it belonged to another
folio of the notes. However, there it was,
rampaging round a peaceful parish in the
West of Ireland. Congested Districts Board
had something to do with it. Whethsr

spouse to a petition from the parishioners,
was among the many things in the narra-
tive which became a little hazy. MICHAEL
JOSEPH might have made all clear, in spite
of his notes, had it not been for the
SPEAKER. Eight hon. gentleman wouldn't
have the bull on any terms. In parlia-
mentary sense he waved red flag whenever
its bellowing was heard in the distance, or
the tip of its horn appeared above the gang-
way. MICHAEL JOSEPH equally deter-
mined to have his way. Why should an

"Now this bull, Sir."
(Mr. Fl-y-n.)
Irishman be denied his* bull? But the
SPEAKER, in spite of his genialfsmile and
courteous manner, is a tough customer to
deal with.
"Now this bull, Sir," said MICHAEL
JOSEPH, slyly leading up the animal by de-
vious course, through the length of which
he thought its existence might be forgotten.
"Order! order!" cried the SPEAKER,
sternly. Whatever might be the case with
the general topic, the bull at least should
not feed on the pastures of the Consolidated
Fund Bill.
It turned out in the end that it wasn't a
bull at all, but a yearling. Whether that
made the case (whatever the case was)
better or worse, MICHAEL JOSEPH was not
permitted to explain.
Illiniums done.—MlCHAZL JOSEPH'S bull
warned off.
Thursday.—Arrangements for formation
of new Party concluded. Began operations
to-night with attack on Clerk at Table.
Unlike its prototype the Fourth Party, it
strides Colossus-wise across floor of House.
One foot is represented by that puissant
other stands, four square to any wind, the
Young Eoscius of pur feeble day, REDMOND
cadet. The Whip is the conqueror of
SITTING BULL, THE O'KELLY. The Party
—well, at present there is no Party. But
here are complete arrangements for its
guidance. At first it was expected that
Cap'en TOMMY BOWXES would slew along-
side, and cruise yard-arm in yard-arm.
But the CAP'EN, in reply to overtures, said
he thought he would prefer to retain the
attitude of A Friendly Power.
Had a very good send-off to-night.
Stopped progress of public business for
fully two hours. This, of course, would
have been nothing in the good old days.
In these times is pretty considerable. Sir
BASHMEAD was in great form. As for the
Young Koscius, his exuberant delight in
his own eloquence almost contagious.
SARK chiefly delighted with the appoint-
ment of THE O'KELLY as Whip. That, he
insists, is a stroke of genius. Aa SITTING
BULL found, there is something irresistible
about THE O'KELLY.
"Eemindsme," says SARK, "of a picture
of KEENE'S that appeared in Punch thirty-
six years ago, and was thereafter a lifelong
delight to the dear DTI MAURIER. Eepre-
sents nearly empty "bus jogging along on
rainy day. In the background are seen
lady and gentleman turning down another
road. 'Now, why didn't you take that there
party?' says the 'busman, turning an in-
dignant face upon the conductor. 'Said
they wouldn't go,' pleaded the pal. 'Said
THEY wouldn't go I' responded the driver
in withering tones of contempt. 'THEY
said they wouldn't go! Why, what do you
suppose you 'rs put there for? Do you
call that conductin' a 'bus '( Oh, THEY
wouldn't go! I like that!' When
the BASHMEAD-REDMOND-ARTLETT Party
ia recruited, and THE O'KELLY wants to
whip them into a particular Lobby, it will
be small use them saying they won't go.''
Business done.—Consolidated Fund Bill
read a third time.
Friday.—Member for South Monaghan
still going about wondering what he really
meant to say on second reading of Irish
Local Government Bill about the Eye of
Ireland. His words were: "Mr SPEAKER,
there will not be a dry eye in Ireland at
the death and burial of the Grand Jury-"
After proceeding some sentences with his
argument, it struck him there was a mis-
take somewhere. Had he meant a dry
eye? On reflection, he thought not. Bet-
ter correct it. The misreading would get
into Hansard, and generations unborn
would puzzle over it. Nothing like being
frank. So he explained that when he
said a dry eye, he had meant a wet one.
Mr. DALY'S manner solemn as be-
comes the Chairman of the Town Com-
missioners of Carrickmacross, and a mem-
ber of its Board of Guardians. Flippant
Members opposite roared with laughter.
Across the gangway came the audible
whisper, "Wet your other eye." Why
should they have laughed, and what had
he really meant, a wet eye or a dry eye?
Business done.—A quiet sitting with the
Army Estimates.

it in an idyllic chapter, he little dreamt that some day it would

Palestine, we see, through the great historian's clear glasses,
Constantinop'e, Cairo, the Pyramids, Suez, and many other

The Making of Matthias. (JOHN LANE.) By J. S. FLETCHER.
Little Master Matthias seems to have been rather oddly "made."
He was " made" much of by both his Grandmother and the old
farm labourer, Timothy; yet was he not spoilt, but somehow
contrived to " make himself " generally useful, lie was beloved
by all
"The pigs and cows and 'osses,
And the long-tailed bull whut tosses,"
(to quote an ancient rhymester,) he birds'-nested, he collected
eggs, he procured an ancient sword from an old Waterloo man,
Corporal Brewster, and, armed with this weapon, he went out by
moonlight alone, and, in the true spirit of a juvenile Dun Quixote,,
cut down whole armies of thistles without a single regret for the
wandering donkey's next day's dinner. He performed the stupen-
dous feat of reading Pilgrim's Progress, Robinson Crusoe, Peter
Wilkins, and Adventures of Christopher Columbus, a'l together,
while simultaneously enjoying his evening meal! This all went
of course to the "making of Matthias " until he was fifteen, when
his Grandmother, who seems to have believed in a sort of modern
illustrated-Christmas-book-Christianity, after simply bidding him
"Be a good man," died, and left him monarch of all he surveyed,
including a hundred sovereigns which were saved up and hidden
away somewhere by an unfortunate Irish labourer, since deceased,
who, from his conversation, appears to have expatriated himself
from one of the Orange districts of that most distressful country.
So at last, as master of the farm, apparently a very decent pro-
perty, with Timothy, aged about sixty-five, still to the fore, and
with a hundred golden sovereigns ready money somewhere about,
Master Matthias, aged fifteen, "laid aside the crown of his child-
hood and took up the harness of the man," and thus was he
"made." The story of his "making" (is it intended as a sort of
"receipt " to guide anyone who might want to make a Matthias?)
is told in a pretty, whimsical, pastoral way, and appears in a
handy book that may serve to wile away a spare hour or so, with
not a few dainty illustrations by LUCY KEMP-WELCH.

"AN EXCUSE FOE THE GLASS."
AT the recent meeting of the "Actors'Association," Sir HENRY
IRVING in the chair, Mr. WYNDHAM, as " CHARLES, his friend,"
told how, once upon a time, when they were both "beginners,"
not in the same piece, but applying at the same theatre for an
engagement, Mr. WYNDHAM, in a touch-an'-go-light-comedy
style, put his elbow through a pane of glass, and neither he nor
IRVING (" afterwards Sir HENRY") had sufficient money in their
pockets to pav for the damage. If IRVING bad had the money,
why should he have paid for what he didn't bretk '1 "Who
breaks, pays." But, "no matter,"—it was a pleasant reminis-
cence not unmixed with pane. Yet Ihe light-hearted and now
heavily-coining Comedian might have added, that if. once, in the
parly days of their theatrical career, HENRY, with "CHARLES, his
friend," had broken a glass in company, at all events many a time
and oft in later years, had they, as festive comrades, " cracked a
bottle together."
"WHY 'VEGETARIAN ' ?"—After Sir HENRY THOMPSON'S ex-
cellent art'cle in this month's Nineteenth Century no self-styled
vegetarian would accept the eminent surgeon's invitation to a
tete-d-tttt dinner for fear his host should tave only asked him to
sit at " a dinner-table fitted with leaves," and should then have
"given him beans."

solved, and peace or war between Spain and the United States

Cape Town, March 8, 1898.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Before trekking up
country among the r/eis (not fleas, I hope)
and kopjes, where you have to be your
own postman, I should like to imitate your
famous advice, and impart a few "Don'ts"
to those of your readers who intend to
visit South Africa. As I am just a week
old as far as life in this colony is con-
cerned, my counsel will doubtless be ac-
cepted for what it is worth, i.e., about one
tickie, or 3d.
In the first place, don't come out here
unless you have an unlimited capacity for
standing, and being stood, drinks. It is
a thirsty land, and great is the consump-
tion of fluids. Don't say "How do you
do?" to a man before you have asked him
what he will take. The bar is the only
starting-place for a conversational exercise.
Don't waste any time in looking for the
Southern Cross. It is like an insignificant
and lop-sided kite, and should be abolished
without delay.
Don't try to eat a South African peach.
It has to be cut and peeled like an apple,
and feels like a billiard ball. It is, 1
believe, used for that purpose in the re-
moter districts where the game is played.
If you have come to your last sovereign,
don't have your things washed. My wash-
ing bill comes to 19s. Id. this week, an
und-r v-st and p-r of p-ts being charged
fivepence each. Verb. sap.
Don't take it as a personal affront if the
Customs Officer enquires if you are landing
any cats, when you have your wife or sistei
with you.

[" Agents are offering to supply milk from Nor-
mandy for London."—Daily Paprr.] If we arc to
hare Normandy milk, why not Normandy milk-
hotels, as you certainly won't get it. Yon
have to wash your own grapes and be
thankful.
Don't wash more than you can help. It
is a pity to make the water dirtier than it
already is.
Don't omit a visit to the really fine
public buildings of Cape Town, such as the
Houses of Parliament, where the officials
are courteousness itself in explaining
things to strangers.
Don't talk about a magnificent " blow-of-
the-eye" (as "AUGUSTS" would term it),
until you have seen Table Mountain and
its attendant peaks rising precipitously
behind the city.
Don't forget to journey to Grooteschuur
(Mr. RHODES' residence), but don't ask
me to pronounce this and other Cape-
Dutch names.
Don't expect to sleep when there are
electric-cars, Salvation bands, steam-whis-
tles, praying mantises, Malays, mosquitoes,
and Bulawayo troopers in full blast within
earshot. Yours negatively.

REPORTED RISING ON THE RIVIERA
HAS FRANCE JOINED RUSSIA P
MENACING ATTITUDE OP THE ALPINE CORPS.
LORD S-L-SB-RT ESCAPES FROM BRAULIEU
IN AN OPEN BOAT.
(from (Jur Special Monaco Commissioner.)
Hotel Necrupole, Monte Carlo.
April 5.
The Far-East-West-Atrican problem has
leached an acute crisis. War-clouds loom
in the offing. It is the night before the
battle.
In un interview with the head croupier
this morning I gathered that, in the event
of France combining with Russia in a hos-
tile demonstration against Great Britain,
the Principality of Monaco would maintain
AN AllMKIi NEUTRALITY.
A young friend of mine at Beaulieu tele-
graphs that shortly after dawn yesterday
a company of the famous Alpine Corps,
armed to the teeth with ropes and ice-
choppers, went through a series of warlike
evolutions opposite Lord S-L-SB-RY'B pic-
turesque villa, which commands an unin-
terrupted view of the Mediterranean.
Under cover of the hour of siesta, the
Premier, accompanied only by a faithful
butler, who earned a tea-basket and
SIX AIR-BLADDERS,
put out to sea in his new outrigger, and
headed for Bordighera.
The wind was contrary and the sea ex-
tremely inclement.
Eluding the French fleet, which lay
round the corner off Villefranche, they
were eventually forced, after battling with
heroic fortitude for a day and a night on
the deep, and suffering unexampled incon-
venience, to put in to Ventimiglia, which
is in the territory of Italy,
OUR ONLY FRIENDS.
Here his Lordship was last seen, wet to
the skin, trying to get the air-bladders
through the douane.
Piper MILNE, the hero of Dargai, has
been telegraphed for.
LATER.
All is quiet at Cimiez.
The QUEEN drove out as usual this after-
noon.
It transpires that Lord S-L-BB-RY yester-
day reviewed a regiment of the Alpine
Corps, and subsequently entertained the
officers at dejeuner.
He remains at Beaulieu, where he finds
tli • climate pleasingly salubrious.
There has been a clerical error about the
hero of Dargai. It was not MILNE, but
FINDLATER, and neither has been sent for.
The new outrigger has not yet arrived
from England. It has to be ordered first.
The sea is calmer than ever.
The relations between Great Britain and
the European Powers continue friendly
and unstrained.
LATER STILL.

A TEST CASE.
"OF COURSE I ENOW HE 's AN AWFULLY STRAIGHT-LACED SORT OF JOHNNIE; BUT IT -S
RATHER A TALL ORDER TO BAY HE XBVXR USES STRONG LANeUAGE, ISN'T IT?"
"I DON'T KNOW. I MET HIM THE OTHER DAY, AND HE SAID IT WAS OPPRESSIVELY
WARM!"
In the best quarters this is regarded as
likely to furnish a causa belli.
STILL LATER.
I have lost all my winnings.
Everything points to peace.
EASTER EGGS.
THE undermentioned folk, we beg
To state, deserve an Easter egg.
For instance, to the Oxford eight,
An egg their win to celebrate.
The piper of the Gordons gay
Who at Dargai ne'er ceased to play,
Tho' shot and wounded in both legs,
To Mr. TREE, who should be proud
Of his amazing Roman crowd
Which with a lifelike movement sways,
We tribute pay, an egg of praise.
To ladies who with forethought kind
Remember those who sit behind,
And leave their hats on cloak-room pegs,
We offer thanks for Easter eggs.
To that just Judge, the Lord High Chief,
Who grants to editors relief
From libel actions, him we deem
Worthy the egg of our esteem.
To best of burlesque boys, "Our Nell,"
Who lately has been so unwell,
The egg of comfort, if not wealth,
I have broken the bank.
And Easter egg of perfect health.
Honours shall have for Easter eggs.

OUR SECOND CHILDHOOD.
["I hear that'stool-ball' is likely to become the
fashionable game at garden parties tais year."
A Ladies' Journal.]
MRS. ALAMODE'S party on Tuesday last
was favoured with delightful weather, and
a large number of guests, including most
of the jeaders of Society, had accepted her
invitation. The entertainment was tho-
roughly chic and up^to-date. After tea—
the chief items of which repast were lemon-
ade, peppermints, and jam-puffs—most of
the coff'pany took part in an exciting game
of " touch-last," which was carried on with
great zest, a Cabinet Minister and an emi-
nent scientist winning loud applause by
their skill. In another part of the grounds
were playing "leap-frog" with evident en-
joyment. ,
THE annual marble-match between Ox-
ford and Cambridge takes place this week,
and is certain to attract an enormous
crowd. Most of the events seem more
than usually open, but the Light Blues will
probably succeed in "hopscotch," while
they can hardly hope to defeat their rivals
in "five-in-a-ring. It is certainly hard
luck upon the Cambridge team that, by an
absurd University statute, they should be
debarred from practising on the Senate-
House steps, which would form a highly
advantageous training-ground. Since, how-
ever, they went into strict training a fort-
night ago, they have been coached by
champion of Swishemall College, and under
his able tuition they are certain to prove a
strong side.
I AM often asked by my readers where
they can obtain really first-class skipping-
ropes at a moderate figure. They cannot
do better than visit Messrs. SMITH AND
ROBINSON'S Bond Street establishment,
where many of the smartest people have
bought their skipping-ropes for this season.
The latest fashion is to have them with
jewelled handles, and the rope dyed a bright
magenta colour. The same firm are also
noted for their peg-tops, but owing to the
great demand for these articles, I hear that
orders for them cannot be executed in less
than a month's time. However, there is a
rumour that whip-tops will become more
fashionable before the season is over.
A CHARMING hoop-gymkhana was held at
Diddledum Court last week, and most of
the events were well-contested. A most
exciting three-mile race was won in gallant
style by the Bishop of the Diocese, who de-
feated the Earl of SHOREDITCH by half-a-
length. I noticed that the right reverend
gentleman bowled an iron-tyred "Invinci-
ble," while his rival propelled a wooden
"Coventry Flyaway." Both these hoops
are splendidly made.
THE selection-committee of the All-Eng-
land N.P.C. have an anxious task before
them in choosing a team of nine-pin players
to represent us against Australia. In the
last test-match, it will be remembered, we
were decisively beaten. But some good
judges aver that the delivery of one of the
Australian team was distinctly unfair. It
is to be hoped that there will be no room
for any doubts of this kind when the return
match takes place at Lord's next week.
A CORRESPONDENT writes to deprecate the
foolish policy of certain enthusiasts who are
attempting to revive the public taste for
such games as cricket, golf, and lawn-
tennis. Their efforts, as he truly points
out, are foredoomed to failure. Pastimes
of this description are suitable enough for
schoolboys, who are able to find pleasure
even in a cricket-match. But, happily, it is
useless to expect in the present day that
grown-up persons will waste their time
over these eminently childish amusements.
How strange it seems to reflect that our
ancestors once preferred the infantile game
called " foot-ball" to a recreation so thrill-
ing as "hide-and-seek " 1
"THE SPECTRAL TRAIN."
IN the Standard of Friday, April 1 (a
suspicious date, it must be conceded), ap-
peared a letter stating how its writer once
saw two trains u-lien there was only one!
The first, he went on to explain, was a
"spectral train," which, "after a short
interval," was followed by a real train.
1 Then he concludes with the question, "Was
the phantom caused by a double reflec-
tion?" It may have occurred to some
ribald sceptics to ask whether the letter
would have been written after "double re-
flection"? For our own part, being on
i moderately good terms with certain fami-
liar spirits, which agree with us on most
occasions, we are inclined to think that
the writer in question actually did see a
"spectral train." The following interro-
gation answered in the affirmative would
put the matter beyond doubt, namely,
"Was the train made up of Bogey car-
I came across two well-known poets, who

(A Ptrsonally-Cojiduclcd Letter.)
DEAR MR. PONCH,—By the time these lines are in type—if you
are g^ood enough to print them—the great British Public will be
considering where to go for the brief Spring recess. This being
so, I think it my duty to put before your readers, with your per-
mission, the result of my calculations. I say without hesitation
that it is perfectly feasible to get to Rome and back for a five-
pound note, and the journey may be made in comfort. There is
no necessity for roughing it.
To start. The Channel route via Dover and Calais is a long
way the best. It costs but a few shillings. One can reach Paris
in half-a-dozen hours—or thereabouts. Of course, one must not
be lavish in one's expenditure in the City of Pleasures. A day's
board will only come to a shilling or two judiciously expended.
Then off to Switzerland, and by the Simplon into Italy. A few
hours may be spent at Stresa, Milan, and Genoa. Then direct to
Rome. In the City of the Popes and the Caesars living is cheap
if one finds out where to go. It will bo woll to reserve a few
shillings for a guide book—a most excellent substitute for a guide.
And having reached Rome, no doubt one's purse will be found
to be exhausted. You cannot get to Paris under a sovereign,
and travelling thence to Switzerland costs a sovereign more, and
a sovereign will be needed for the railway journey to Italy. The
remaining forty shillings will have served for refreshments on
the road. Added together, the expenses come to £o. Q. E. D.
Yours very faithfully, A PRACTICAL MAX.
P.S.—By the way, I find that I have not allowed funds for the
journey home. This is a detail. If worst comes to the won-t,
one can walk.

UNFEELING.
Bystander (to Amateur Jockey, whose mount has unseated him). "D'YER MIND DOIN' THAT AGAIN, CAPTING? MY PAL 'KRB DIDN'T
QUITE SEE IT!"
CHANGING FEOM DAY TO DAY.
(Extract from a Leading Article picked up in Fleet Street.)
THERE is no doubt that a crisis is at hand. We are in the
midst of alarms and rumours of war, and the coming cloud of
disaster rises above the horizon. The day for half measures is
over, and now it is the duty of every Briton—be he soldier,
sailor, or civilian—to keep his powder dry and to be ready, aye,
ready. It must not be forgotten that England is England, and
what the " tight little island" once haa done, can and may have
to be re-accomplished.
And yet Peace is not only an ideal. After all and before all,
men are a band of brothers. There is but little difference between
the Russian and the Anglo-Saxon, the Teuton and the Celt.
Human nature is very human, and blood is thicker than water.
We may fight lions and tigers, but common sense forbids man—
intelligent man—taking up the sword against his brother. It is
unnatural. It is unwise.
But honour is honour. As our national bard has tersely put
it, he who steals a purse steals trash. But honour is honour.
The sword is the last resource it is true, but it must be unsheathed
when the good fame of a nation cries for protection. It has been
this jealousy of reputation that has called into existence DRAKE
and MARLBOROUGH, WELLINGTON and NELSON.
And yet who would shed blood for an idea '( In these days of
modern civilisation the pen has taken the place of the cannon.
Is not ink stronger than gunpowder, paper than dynamite?
And what is honour? Is it not a sentiment that varies in
interpretation? The honour of the Hottentot is not the honour of
the European. Then why fight for an idea? The notion is not
only pernicious, but absurd.
In conclusion, there is but one word more to be said. It may
is more or less contradictory. The purist may even go so far as
to declare that what we have asserted in one paragraph we have
contradicted in its successor. Be it so. But let our readers
remember that at this season of the year most things have to be
written in advance—aye, and much in advance —to secure the
well-earned leisure of the Easter Vacation.
Note and Query to Sir H-nry Th-mps-n (Inspector
of Food Feeding).
N. Being in "the lemperate zone," it is incumbent on us to
live temperately. Of course. In the "intemperate zone" the
duty would be equally evident.
Q. Might an author, who makes his livelihood entirely by con-
tributing regularly to magazines, be fairly described as "one

who lives on ' cereals'
MR. PUNCH observes that there is a general wish to make the
Crystal Palace a National Institution. Mr. P. cordially endorses
the views of the promoters of the movement, but suggests, in
view of the Exhibition of 1851, that the undertaking should be
extended in its scope, and that a new international slab be placed
beneath the great Constructor's bust under the Terrace, inscribed
"Pax-stone," as a memorial of International Peace.
"THE COMING RATE."—Generally a very rapid one if it is a
bicyclist, and then also a very dangerous one to the unprotected
pedestrian.

collect the rents.

DARBY JONES ON THE ALEXANDRA PARK
SPRING MEETING.
HONOURED SIR,—You, and, I trust, my
other noble patrons can appreciate whether
your Humble Vates deserves well of his
fellow-citizens. You little know the pride
with which even the very minor Prophets
point to their successful prognostications,
nor what little capital is needed to make
a Gullible Public hand over its Hard-earned
Shekels for "One-horse Snips," "Wires
from the Course," "Stable Secrets," and
"Special Certainties." Far be it from me
to depreciate the Astuteness of those Seers
who, having given, say, Cotopaxi at 5 to
1 on, and Chimbora-o at 6 to 4 on, proclaim
the Triumph of their Perspicacity with a
vigour, which causes the Man-out-of-the
Know to surmise that the Victorious
Quadrupeds were probably owned, bred,
trained, aye, and even ridden by these
vociferous gentry, but I do say that a
Professor of Equine Research, who by dint
of Hard Study is enabled to sift the Wheat
from the Chaff, and pick out plums such as
the diminutive John Homer never dreamt
of, from the Currant Cake, I repeat, that
Toiler of the Turf is worthy of more gold,
silver or bronze than the unseemly assaults
from toe-capped boots, which—alas! I
speak feelingly—often fall to his lot. And
it is in the early Spring that the Illwminati
ari busy with the Records of the Past,
remembering deeds which the Careless
Punter never calls to mind, while they
look up weights and distances, and gene-
rally polish their Memories with Chrono-
logical Facts.
But let us back to our Gee-Gees, and to
that "Spring, Spring, gentle Spring,"
which used in bygone days musically to
intoxicate our ears at Covent Garden
Theatre, and yet drove us to thoughts of
self-destruction when repeated by the
Banditti of the Barrel-organ.
I turn in what may be called a Week
of Desolation to the Catherine at Alexan-
dra Park—to my mind, a curious sort of
show, where some Jockeys finish nohow
and some Horsw nowhere. There are
manv Mysteries, believe me, honoured Sir,
developed on the Sward which abuts on
the International Exhibition of 1862. Here
the Genial and Generous Licensed Vic-
tualler, especially on a Saturday, is in full
swing, but nevertheless he rubs coats in
Tattersall's Ring with some of the most
Aristocratic Philequists (my own, own
word) who ever wore Newmarket Coats or
wore patent leather boots. There are
ladies too, ns well, who have indulged in
fish often of the Fried Order for their
luncheons, but are none the less as hearty
as if they had made their ifinaun on
beef steaks or mutton chops, while drinks
effervesce, from champagne to bottled stout.
In short, esteemed patron, Alexandra Park
is jovial. Having said this much, let me
put my selection into poetical prfcis worthy
of Lord SALISBITRY and HER MAJESTY'S
Foreign Office. It runs as follows: —
Beware of the Furniture Bart,
Beware if the Rooster is there:
But look out if the Yankfe should start,
And the Un-named may make us all stare!
Having thus wandered into a land not
often touched upon, I remain, honoured
Sir,
Your obedient and Argus-eyed Servitor,
DARBY JONES.

Rough Rider (to old Creeper, who will not let his horse jump). "Now THEN, GUV'NOR, IF YOU
ARE QUITE SURE YOU CAN'T GET UNDER IT, PERHAPS YOU 'LL LET ME 'AVE A TURN!"
OUR HUNT "POINT TO POINT."
LAST week our Point to Point steeple-
chase came off. So did several of the
riders: this merely par parenthese. I
offered to mark out the course, and, as
I intended to escape the dread ordeal of
riding by scratching my horse at the last
moment, I thought it would be great fun
to choose a very stiff, not to say blood-
thirsty, line. Awful grumbling on the
part or those unhappy ones who were to
ride. Just as the bell rang for saddling,
Captain SFROOZER, ready dressed for the
fray, came up to me with very long face,
and said, "Beastly line this, you know,
PHUNKER. I call it much too stiff."
I smiled in pitying and superior manner.
"Think so, my dear SPROOZER? My
horse can't run, worse luck, but I only
wish I were going to have the gallop
over it."
"So you shall, then!" cried a rasping
voice, suddenly, from behind me. Sir
HERCULES BLIZZARD was the speaker, an
awful man with an awful temper. "So
you shall. My idiot of a jockey broke
his collar-bone trying to jump one of the
fences on this confounded course of yours
to-day, so, as I am without a rider, you
shall ride my mare Dinah."
Swallowed lump in my throat as I
thanked him for his offer, but thought I
had better decline, as I didn't know the
mare, and besides that, I
"Oh! all right, I know what you are
going to say: that you 're not much good
on a horse "—(nothing of the sort! I was
not going to say any such thing, confound
the man!) "Of course, I know all that,
and that you 're not much of a rider; but
I can't help myself now. It's too late to
get a decent horseman, so I shall have to
make shift with you."
Deuced condescending of him. I made
a feeble effort to escape, and would cheer-
fully have paid a hundred pounds for the
chance of doing so. PHIL POCNDAWAY,
great friend of mine, came up and said
(sympathetically, as I thought at first).
"I should think you 'd prefer to get off
it, wouldn't you, PHUNKER?"
Thought he would volunteer in my place,
so was perfectly frank with him. "My
dear PHIL, I 'd give a hundred to get
off -"
"Ah! you will, I expect, at the first
fence, without paying the money!" he
grinnerl, as he turned away.
Murder was in my heart at that moment.
I got on Dinah, and, feeling like death,
rode down to the starting-post. Thoughts
of a misspent youth, of home and friends
and things, came o'er me. I seemed once
more to see the little rose-covered porch,
the --
"What on earth are you mooning
about?" thundered the Blizzardmn voice
in my ear. "Take hold of her head tighter
than that, or you '11 be off!"
The next moment the starter yelled
"Go!" and away, like a whirlwind, we
sped across the first field, towards a huge.

earthwards, and, instead of alighting on
the saddle, I found myself " sitting on the
floor." A howl—it might have been of
sympathy, but it didn't sound quite like
that—arose from the crowd, and then ]
thought that I would go home on foot,
instead of returning to explain matters to
Sir HERCULES. As a matter of fact, I don't

ZARD, at all events, not just now.
SONGS FOE THE NATION.
"Adus Upt t \v(vfu airyi iaatima\."
'Arryitophane*.
IT is evident that the Nation is yearning
for singable songs in the "Arry dialect.
The late lamented ARTEMUS WARD would
probably have said, "Let her yearn";
but a stern sense of duty impels me to
try and meet the need, created by the
Daily Chronicle. I have a comforting
impression that all that is necessary to
insure correctness is to "chinge " as many
"a "s as possible into " i "s. By this means
I secure the "local colouring," which, by
the wav, has undergone a complete change
since DICKENS spelt Weller "with a wee,
my Lord." A catchword, a vropon of
nothing, is always useful, so I have duly
provided it.

struck by the account of a recent mis-
understanding at one of our great uni-
versities, which, it is said, owed its origin
to the brusqueries of the towing-path. The
matter was quickly amicably arranged,
and consequently leaves but a memory,
and perhaps a lesson. I say a lesson,
because, does not the incident teach us
that urbanity is the best policy? And
I would apply the teaching to the parade
ground. Surely towards the end of the
century, we can dispense with the rough-
ness of the drill-sergeant in favour of the
polished diction of the well-educated in-
structor. The suggestion is d propos of
the moment, as in the near future the
annual addition to our constitutional force
will present themselves for training. To
make my meaning plainer, I will adopt the
dramatic form of narration.
SCENE—The Barrack Square. PRESENT—A
Squad of Recruits standing at case. Thi
Drill Sergeant enters, when the rank and fill
come smartly to attention, smile, and salute.
Drill Sergeant. Thank you, my friends
Your reception of me is too kind—too
cordial. And allow me to hint, too, that it
is unnecessary to salute any one beneath
the rank of a commissioned officer. Bui
you mean kindly, my lads, you mean kindly
First Recruit. We were glad to see you
S;r.
D. S. I am pleased to hear you say so
But it is my duty to remark that talking
in the ranks—without consent—is unlawful
And now we will form fours.
Second S. A most difficult manosuvre
And if, gallant chief, we make a mess of it

Cabby. "YES. LOTS." 'Arry. "WELL, DON'T!"
D. S. (smiling). You are not likely to
make me angry. But I am sure you will
forgive me if I beg for silence.
First It. Most certainly. We quite agree
that discipline must be preserved.
Second R. Entirely so. And now, good
Sir, you were saying
D. S. That forming fours is no difficult
operation when properly understood. You!
have been so kind as to number off?
First R. We have, Sir. We got into our
places, rear and front rank, and in open
order, before you reached the ground.
D. S. Thank you. It was a kindly
thought. At the word "fours," the even
numbers will step back a pace and then
take a pace to their left, each man covering;
his comrade when " deep" is added. Should
"right" or "left" or "about" take the
place of " deep," then each man will follow!
the direction. I hope you understand me?
First R. Nothing could be clearer. Your
Second R. Exactly. Pray accept our
heartfelt thanks for your kind courtesy.
&c., &c., &c., &c.
There, Mr. Punch, if this system were
adopted instead of the gruff treatment of
the time passing, I am sure all would go
well with the British army.
Believe me,
Yours in all sincerity,

TOMMY ATKINS.

You do not at this juncture
Feel, as I, the dreadful smart,
And you scorn the cruel puncture

You will know why I was burning,
I hope you will extend to us your pardon.
And was scorched alone, by you!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE author of The Lmidonert (HEINEMANN), Mr. EGBERT
HlCHEtfS, calls his eccentric story "an absurdity," and so it is.
As amusing nonsense, written in a happy-go-lucky style, it
works up to a genuine hearty-laugh-extractmg scene between
Mr. Buth and Mr. Lite, and then between the major-domo and
his employer with a telephone between them, and it is a pity that
soon after this capital farcical situation the story ia not brought
rapidly to a conclusion. When The Private Secretary was first
produced it was in four acts, and was a comparative failure. On
being reduced to three acts, it blossomed out and grew into a
memorable success. Unfortunately, T/ie Londoners cannot now
be abbreviated, but had Mr. HICHBNS finished it in 249 pages,
instead of doing the joke to death in 338 pages, it would have
achieved a quite exceptional popularity in these days when we
have to turn back to DICKENS, MAEETAT. and LEVEE, for a
hearty laugh, and to THACKERAY for a most enjoyable quiet
chuckle. But "for a' that and a' that" The Londtmers is one of
the most outrageous pieces of extravagant absurdity we have
come across for many a day.
A new edition of Mr. W. S. GILBERT'S well-known Bab Ballads
and Songs of the Savoy (GEORGE RoUTLEDGB & SONS), with no
less than 350 illustrations by the author, and a capital portrait of
him as frontispiece, is a welcome addition to any library. On
the title-page is an eccentric vignette, almost Thackerayan, re-
presenting an infant, supported on a inusic-stool by female hands,
in the act of thumping, with both its little fists, the key-board
of a piano, on the stand of which rests an open music-book.
Whether this be intended to represent a certain gifted composer
obtaining material support from somebody, to whom the hands
belong, while engaged on the innocent pastime of making tunes
to the author's lines, or whether it symbolises the "Bab," or
a question which the author alone can satisfactorily determine.
However, connecting the infant phenomenon on the title-page
with two other infant phenomena (one speechifying and the other
listening) on the cover, it is but fair to suppose that these
amusing Ballads, with their quaint illustrations, were originally
devised withjno other purpose than that of wiling away a few
spare moments with a book of whimsical verses, out of which one
could pick "here a bit and there a bit and everywhere a bit,"
then put it down with a smile, and return to it when serious.
Although, in the Public School of Poetry, these Ballads are not
to be ranked in the "first division upper fifth," with the
humorous poems of HOOD, "BON GAULTIEB," THACKERAY,
BAKHAM, or CALVERLEY, yet they may be considered as holding
a unique position in the "Eemove," bracketed with that other
nonsensical verse-writer, LEWIS CAEEOLL (who, however, might
have owed some of his inspiration to the Sab Ballad*), and we
should be inclined to place not a few of the ballads in the
"Upper," and the remainder in the "Lower Eemove." The
quaint illustrations seem to be from the hand of a talented ad-
mirer of DICKY DOYLE'S inimitable handiwork. The songs from
the operas necessarily lose two-thirds of the point given them by
actor and composer." By the way, was there in the mind of Mr.
II. G. WELLS an unconscious reminiscence of having read the
liab Ballad on the "Perils of Invisibility " when he devised hia
Invisible Man r1
"Old Peter vanished like a shot.
But then—hii tuit of clothts did not."
Which situation, as comically illustrated by Mr. GILBERT, was, if
I remember aright, very much the predicament of Mr. WELLS'S
invisible hero.
The public taste, always fickle, is undoubtedly growing tired
of kail-yard literature. Too many CROCKETTS spoil what, to begin
with, was a sufficiently toothsome broth. My Barouite, however,
"Babe " himself, supported by Applause "with both hands," is
ventures to advise the inquiring reader not on this account to

THE BAHON DE B.-W.
"OUR LEARNED FRIEND" IN A PORTRAIT PREDICAMENT.
"I REALLY think, PORTINGTON," I said to my admirable and
excellent clerk, "that this communication waa of sufficient im-
portance to have been forwarded to my private address."
"Well, Sir, I believed it to be a circular, and you know you
do sometimes come to your chambers. Why, Sir, you have been
twice this year."
"My visits here would be more frequent if I did not consider
that my interests were absolutely safe in your hands. But,
really, this was a sad oversight."
I confess I was greatly annoyed. I held in my hands an invita-
tion from an eminent firm of photographers to grant them a
sitting. In a lithographed letter they expressed their intention
of publishing my portrait in their popular periodical, Famous
Faces. The packet had been lying unopened for weeks at my
Temple address. There was no knowing to what inconvenience
the eminent firm may have been put by my apparent dilatoriness
in sending a reply.
"Well, Sir," said my worthy retainer, "I am very sorry, and
I can't say more. I thought it was a circular, because the other
gentlemen got the same sort of despatch and they didn't pay any
attention to them."
I smiled at the idea. Imagine any one asking for the pre-
sentment of DE PUTRE POTTE'S with a view to publication I How-
ever; I determined to repair my bin of omission as early as
possible, and proceeded forthwith to the studio of my corre-
spondents. I was received with great cordiality by a young
lady of considerable personal attractions, and shown into a sort
of conservatory on an upper floor. After a few momenta I was
joined by a gentleman in a costume not unsuggeative of the
undress of a Royal Academician.
"YesP" he said, in atone of interrogation.
"You were good enough to ask me to sit for your publication,
Famous Faces. I am here to comply with your request."
He walked backward a few paces, and then forming his hands
into a frame, looked at me through the aperture. Then he
hurriedly departed and as hurriedly returned, bringing with him
a forensic wig.
"Please put this on."
I hesitated, for I noticed that it was the head-dress of a Lord
Chancellor.
"Well, perhaps it is only a little premature," I suggested,
with a smile; and then I was struck by a happy idea. "I sup-
pose you would not object to my publishing the portrait if I
made suitable acknowledgment?"
"Oh, no, you must not do that, for we shall hold the copy-
right. But I daresay, should the occasion arise, we might come
to terms."
I was pleased to hear this, as I had in my mind the appearance
of the memoirs which I have been engaged in writing tor some
years past, under the title of, From the Gown of the Student to
the Chancellor's Wig. The photo about to be taken would form
an admirable frontispiece to the second volume, the picture of
the first tome of course being myself in the days of my pupil-
hood. I assumed the wig and also a gown in appropriate com-
plement. After the customary requests to smile, look pleasant,
and nearly dislocate my neck in the attempt to assume an easy
position, the portrait was fixed and I took my departure. In
due course I received a proof, and was extremely pleased with
the artistic result of the sitting.
Months passed. Deeply engrossed in my autobiography, I have
little time for the consideration of other matters save those ol
a strictly professional character. However, the a<*air of which
I am writing, if not entirely forensic, is, in my judgment, of the
gravest moment.
"Have you noticed this portrait, Sir," asVed PORTINOTON,
placing a picture of myself before me. I glanced at it hastily,
and recognised the subject. "You are wearing the robes of a
Lord Chancellor."
"Yes, distinctly premature," I returned, "but we cannot
prevent a photographer from assuming, if he pleases, the func-
tions of a prophet."
"But do you see the name of the publication, SirP"
"No doubt Famous Faces. I was to appear in that periodical.'

the pages devoted to advertisements, and, begging your pardon,
Sir, were you taken in a group?"
I seized the paper, and found (as usual) that what my admir-
able and excellent clerk had suggested as the case was justified
by the evidence before me. My portrait was in the sheet re-
served for trade announcements in the journal mentioned. I
was represented seated in my robes discussing a meal with a
young lady of great beauty. The picture was inscribed, "The
Luncheon Adjournment," and the commending label was, "They
are thoroughly enjoying Somebody's Sausages." No doubt the
idea desired to be conveyed was, that I and my fair companion
were both enchanted with the comestibles of Mr. Somebody.
For a moment, I was speechless with indignation.
I need scarcely say that I shall take the earliest opportunity
of calling the proprietors of Famous Faces to account. In the
meanwhile, what makes the matter the more embarrassing to me
as a married man, is the fact that the young lady of great beauty,
with whom I am depicted devouring Somebody's Sausages,
is unfortunately not my wife. (Signed) A. BRIEFLESS, JUNIOR.

WITH that effete congeries called Europe
Our starry Eagle now proceeds to cope;
And when this urgent Fowl puts down his
claw,
His flap is final and his whoop is law!
The late respected MONROE (now a saint),
When here below he wore his warrior paint,
Letting his patriot eye roll large and clear
Around the occidental hemisphere,
Decided once for all to tuck the thing
Beneath the Eagle's prophylactic wing.
Whoever on that Doctrine cast a doubt
The Eagle would arrange to wipe them out'
Not that he wished to widen our domain,
O no! he merely reckoned to restrain
Deciduous despots who proposed to sit
On Freedom's hallowed patch of perquisite.
That is the Doctrine, palpably inspired,
Which makes the Ancient World so deadly
tired;
Which when our President pro tern, intones,
Crowned monarchs squirm upon their
crusted thrones!
True, there are regions on our local map
Which just at present we have failed to tap;
Spots, such as Canada, that still agree
To truckle to a palsied tyranny;
But yet the blessed principle is there,
And anyone may feel it in the air.
Some time ago a painful case arose
In which we quoted MONROE through our
Quite loud. It did not have the same effect
As we had been encouraged to expect.
The other Anglo-Saxons thought the bluff
Was good, but not precisely good enough,
And they would " raise " us. At this June-
ture, we,
Guessing how difficult it is at sea
To fight successfully without a fleet,
Replied that water cannot well compete
With blood for thickness. This, they said,
was so;
And, if convenient, they would like to
know
Who MONROE was. And thus, with mutual
jest,
And many a threat of amity, we pressed
Each other to the heart.
But well we knew
That, when we next should have occasion to
Run MONROE out, we really must select
Our enemy with caution—in effect,
A negligeable nation, either one
Without a ship or any sort of gun;
Or, if it had an armament at all,
That armament should be extremely small;
We building hard meanwhile.
And now the hour
Has come, and with it comes the very
Power
We wanted—old, corrupted, worn with war,
And proud as Satan. We are going for
That Power, if possible, upon the foam
Close by; we never fight away from home;
The sea is so intolerably wide
It bores the Eagle: so we play this side.
Unless, of course—and here opinion varies—
And what a cause the noble creature
pleads!
See how his filibustering bosom bleeds
For Man. Disinterestedly humane
(As Eagles go) he wishes to explain
The nature of the leading Christian graces
As suited to the rule of subject races.
Himself, in simple kindness, used to smack
The Afric nigger, who is coloured black,
And Injun (red); he therefore ought to
know.
And it is just that he should boss the show
Without the help, whoever he may be,
Of any blamed European referee.
May Heaven, our only need, defend the
right,
What time the gentle Eagle strips to fight!
Before this trifling gem appears_in type,
The fatal moment may be fairly ripe;
Or else it mayn't. One thing alone is sure.
Which is, that our designs are good and
pure:
We never wanted (on our solemn word)

MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,— In these hard
times, I am sure you will be glad to hear
that I hare discovered a really safe invest-
ment. It is a new fabric that grows upon
trie's a few score of miles from the coast
of one of the most recent of our savage
settlements. The fabric can be used for a
variety of purposes, as a roofing to a rail-
way station, a baby's rattle, an umbrella
covering, or a coating to an ironclad. It
can be easily cleaned, and takes a magnifi-
cent polish. But ydu need not trouble
yourself about that. I am satisfied it is
all right. It is certain to make any one's
fortune the moment it is brought into the
market. It will be seized at once by
builders, buttermen, tailors, smiths, green-
grocers, butchers, architects, glass-house
builders, and the like. There are already
clamorous demands for it from Cheltenham,
Chiswick, Homerton and Hornsey Rise.
About five thousand really seasoned soldiers
would be amply sufficient to clear the road
from the forest to the coast. Should the
natives give any trouble, the watercourses
(if any exist) might be augmented with
their blood. But that, again, is a detail.
So pray plank down your last dollar.
You must get a return upon your capital
of from five hundred to a thousand per
cent. I must conclude, as I am off to my
stockbroker.
Now, I have got all these particulars
from the pioneer shareholder, who knows
all about it. Pray understand me for the
last time. I assure you nothing 1 have ever
touched could be safer. And now away

"EEFORMING THE JUDGES."
THE following letters are worth quoting
from the Dot/]/ Bail. There are others,
but these three give the gist of an inte-
resting correspondence.
To the Editor of the Daily Bail.
Newgate, April 11.
SIR,—As a burglar of long standing, 1
have often had occasion to notice the piti-
ful way in which people knock under to
HEB MAJESTY'S judges, until they (the
judges) naturally consider themselves
everybody and everything. This is foolish
and wrong. A little firmness on the part
of a prisoner at the bar will often work
wonders. I myself once interrupted a long
tirade by a judge who was passing sentence
upon me, by asking him if he were an
escaped lunatic. The result of this unex-
pected assertion of manly independence
was satisfactory and startling. The judge
died instantaneously in a fit—a great moral
object-lesson for all concerned. With a
little care, we might reform our judges
off the face of the earth.
Yours, Ac., "JKMMT."
Old Bailey, April 12.
SIR,—I have read with interest the letter
in your last issue on the subject of "re-
forming the judges." But your corres-
pondent, Mr. JEMMY, makes a great mis-
take if he supposes that he will succeed in
reforming the judges!" Where will he
begin? With their costumes, which are
absurd; their tempers, which are intoler-
able; or their manners, which in many
cases, alas I are practically non-existent P"
I have constant opportunities of watching
them, so that I certainly ought to be a
good judge. In fact, I would be a better
judge than any of them for half-price.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY op TOBY, M.P.
Home of Commons, Monday, April 4.—
CHARLIE BBRESFORD at it again about the
dark period of his career when he was yet
a boy. Would have House bel'eve that if
ever there was a thorough rapscallion, a
terror to his tutors, a pain to bis parents,
a warning to all nursari s, it was CHARLES
WILLIAM DE LA POER BERESFORD, whose
boyish iniquity darkened the mid-century.
Early in Session he openly confessed to
shuddering House that he had himself
"been a scallywag." Later, discussing in
Committee Navy Estimates, he made
Members' flesh creep by hinting at his
pranks as a cadet on the Britannia.
"If," he said, " I had been sent to prison
every time 1 broke bounds I should have
spent the flower of my youth in gaol."
SABK knows nothing about the Britan-
nia, but he happened to be one of the
Rev. Mr. FOSTERS pupils at Stubbington,
Fareham, Hants, when CHARLIE BERES-
KORD was there. It is little more than
forty years ago. The gallant admiral just
shipped his first jacket and trowsers. SARK
says he positively smelt of pinafore; was
the meekest, mildest, best-behaved boy in
the whole school. Had an almost cherubic
voice; used to sing in the choir of Fare-
ham Church. When the boys would let
him, he liked to stand up after tea, fold
his hands before him, and pipe a screed
which ran something like this: —
In a Sunday School I am a scholar, la, la.'
I dearly love my Papa and my Mn, Ma, Ma!
I dote upon my teacher too, so true, true, true,
And what he Dids me try to do, I do, do, do.
Teacher, teacher! Why am I so happy, happy,
In my Sunday School?
I put away on Sunday all my toys, tojs, toys,
And never go and play with naughty boys, boys,
boys,
Who into wicked men will surely grow, grow, grow,
And where at last they'll go to, I don't know,
know, know.
Teacher, teacher! Why am I so happy, happy,
In my Sunday School?
He rarely got beyond this second verse,
the audience regarding its drift as personal.
Usually, at this juncture, they set upon
and buffeted him. Discipline borne with
noon, having sung the first two verses with
the customary consequence, he sneaked
back to the school-room, climbed on
window-sill, and his linnet-like voice was
heard trilling: —
I keep my little hands and face so clean, clean,
clean;
My little heart within is all serene, rene, rene.
I stand quite still upon my little feet, feet, feet,
And pretty little verses I repeat, ptat, peat.
Teacher, teach
At this moment the pack, rushing out

of school-house, were upon him, and
CHARLIE saved up the rest of the chorus
for another time.
Very interesting these reminiscences of
a great man's boyhood. Show how curi-
ously memory is warped when it takes
autobiographical turn. The hero of the
Condor, looking back upon his blameless
boyhood, has created a bugbear of a boy.
; Probably, even SARK'S personal testimony,
now made public for the first time, will not
convince him of his hallucination.

SIE GEORGE AND THE DRAGON OF USURY.
L" It is bad enough to know that men are the victims of this system if
usury, but when this abuse has grown to such proportions thatjmarried women
become the prey of the money-lender, surely the time has arrived when this
trade should be put down by the strong arm of the law In my judgment
they are a curse to society and a danger to the community."
Sir George Lewi»'s Letter to the " Timtt," Api'iH.~\
Mr. Punch loudly says, " Hear, hear!"
OUR CLUB.
THE other day we had our annual general meeting. Thr
Chairman of our Committee stated that the finances of the clul
were in the most flourishing condition (" Hear! hear!"), and
that, with continued attention to economy on the part of our
excellent House Committee and of our admirable Secretary
(" Ifiar! t.ear!") we might hope not only to remain prosper-
ous, but even after about twenty years to accumulate a fund
with which to buy the freehold of the club-house. (Loud chetrs.)
This statement has aroused immense enthusiasm amongst the
members, who are unanimous in their desire to buy the freehold
as soon as possible. We should all feel so much more comfort-
able. It has been pointed out that even the Athenaeum does not
possess a freehold house. Everyone has been suggesting somr
economy which will enable us to surpass the Athenseum.
JONES, who is rather particular about his food, proposes that
the club dinner should be cut down. Some members grumble at
the fish. Let us have only sardines. Others complain about the
meat. Let us get it from Australia. As for poultry and game,
have none at all.
BOBINSON, who is very particular about his drink, thinks we
might do a lot with our wine-list. The grocer in the next street
has some claret, which is really excellent, at the price.
BRIOGS, who gets a heap of papers by his side and reads
through them steadily, says we might save in papers. Let u.-
have one halfpenny paper and Punch, and no more. But the
other members blame BRIGGS for his extravagant ideas, and say
we could do without the halfpenny paper.
WILKINSON is the man who always gets in the most comfort-
able arm-chair and fall;- asleep in front of the fire. He now says
we waste a lot of money on Turkey carpets and leather-covered
seats. Let us have oil-cloth on the floors and sit on plain
wooden chaire.
GREEN, who writes an immense number of letters on the club
paper, proposes that we should pay for our stationery as we pay
for our cigarettes, a penny a sheet.
paper from the other side of the room. He now suggests that we
might do without waiters. Heaven helps those who help them-
selves. Let us help ourselves.
BROWN, who has proposed some of our greatest improvements,
though he is rather a duffer, now makes the most valuable
suggestion. He is mortally afraid of draughts, thinking perhaps,
as he is a little man, that he might easily be blown out of the
room. He says that if we all wore our hats, as they do in some
very swell clubs, and also brought ulsters and railway rugs,
we could do without fires altogether. The saving in coal would
be immense.
We all agree that, if we had cheap wines and cheap chairs, no
carpets, no papers, and no waiters, no fish, no fowls, and no fires,
we could settle down comfortably, knowing that in fifteen years,
or less, the freehold would be ours.

TALL SCORING.
(A Bowler's Nightmare.)
SEATED in my study, I had just read in
one of the evening papers that, in a recent
cricket-match between Melbourne Univer-
sity and Essendon, the former side had
compiled the record score of 1,697 in their
first innings, when .... "In my study,"
did I say? What an absurd mistake; why,
I was sitting in a cricket-pavilion, look-
ing on at a match. And, apparently, I
was talking to an old gentleman seated
at my side, who was making remarks on
the game. Suddenly a loud cheer pro-
claimed the fall of a wicket. My companion
turned to me wrathfully.
"Just what I was saying," he exclaimed.
"These men aren't the slightest use. Why
on earth they are played for the county
I can't think. Look at that, five of the
best wickets down for something under
seven hundred runs! Perfectly sickening, I
call it!"
"I beg your pardon," I asked, in some
surprise, "but what did you say was the
score?"
"There it is, Sir," he replied, brandishing
his umbrella in the direction of the tele-
graph-board. "Read it yourself—680 runs,
five wickets, last man 152. And they told
us he was a coming man I 152, indeed!
Simply paltry!"
"Dear me," I ventured to say, "but
isn't that a pretty fair innings?"
My companion became more indignant
than ever. "None of your beastly sar-
casm. You know well enough that if
nowadays a man can't make three or four
hundred at least, he might just as well
not go in at all. Ah I that's more like it,"
he broke off, as the new batsman let out
at a half-volley. "Well run, Sir! Go
again, go again I Seven or eight more
yet! There, that's all! Stay where you
arel Seventeen," he added, turning to
me again, "a very pretty hit."
"Very," I assented, dubiously, "but,
pardon my ignorance, for I haven't seen
much cricket lately, is there any chance of
this match ever being finished?"
"Of course there is," was the answer.
"I dare say it will be quite short, and
won't last over a fortnight, although of
course it's set down as a three-weeks'
match. There 's a pretty stroke!" he
added, as one of the batsmen dexterously
snicked a fast ball through the slips for
thirteen. "Come, we'll soon have the
thousand up now."
"And what," 1 enquired, "do you con-
sider a good average score P"
"Well, that depends. But on a tolerable
wicket a strong batting side ought never
to be dismissed under three thousand.
As, however, this in only a trial match
against the colts, 1 dale say the county
will declare their innings closed pretty
soon. Did you see that overr" JOHNSON
drove that slow bowler for sixteen three
times running, and then put him trickily
to short leg lor eight. Look, there 's the
thousand going up now. Ah," he ex-
claimed, as the players all walked towards
tne pavilion, '' 1 told you so. They 've
'declared.' Sorry for you, Sir, since you
won't get your innings!"
"My innings!" 1 gasped. "But—but
—I'm not play ing!"
"None ot your jokes with me," said the
old gentleman, with some asperity. '• If
you 're not playing for the county, why are
you wearing the county cap, and how is it
you 're down on the card? I know who
you are, right enough. Be off with you,
you 've got to get out into the field now;
there 's the bell 1"
Overwhelmed with surprise, I walked
across to the scorer's table. There, sure
enough, was my name among the list of
the county team. So I went out to speak
to the captain, who was already placing the
field, meaning to pomt out that there was
some mistake. To my astonishment, he
called out to me by name, throwing me
the ball. "You may as well begin at that
end," he said. "1 've put long-on about a
quarter of a mile behind the wicket. Will
that suit you t"
Then two batsmen appeared, and I began
to bowl. Of all that happened subse-
quently I have only a vague recollection;
after a short time a kind of grey horror
came upon me. But it seemed as though
1 were bowling for centuries to a pair of
demon batsmen, who smote my most cun-
ning deliveries for miles. It made no
difference whether I sent in short-pitched
balls or yorkers, all were treated alike;
and when I was not bowling I had to run
for hours—or so it seemed—before I could
catch up the ball, whenever a batsman
made one of his terrific hits in my direc-
tion. In vain I appealed piteously to the
captain to let me go home. "Nonsense,"
he said, "you "re bowling excellently.
Why, they Ve only made forty-two off your
three last overs!"
How long the dreadful game went on I
cannot say. At last, when the score was
somewhere about two thousand, we got a
man run out (he was trying to steal a
twelfth run off a cut that went straight to
cover-point), and therewith stumps vere
drawn for the day. I sank to the ground
utterly exhausted, and my captain came
and looked at me derisively.
"Remember, we start play at 7 A.M. sharp
to-morrow," he said. Mind you're here
in time."
"And we 've only got one wicket 1" I
groaned. "That leaves nine to get, nine
more wickets, and each of them"
A strange smile came over the captain's
face. "Nine more?" he interrupted.
"You forget, this is a colts' match, and
we're playing against a twenty turn!"
At these awful words, I gave a shriek of
despair and fainted .... and awoke to
find myself in my study, seated before the
fire, and with the evening paper still upon
my knee.

"You forget, this is a colts' match, nnd
we're playing against a tirenty-tw!"
At these awful words, I gave a shriek of
despair and fainted .... and awoke to
find myself in my study, seated before the
fire, and with the evening paper still upon
my knee.

OUR STEWARD.
A NOTE FROM THE YACHTING DIARY OF
TOBY, M.P.
S.-y. "Maritana," LnchEtive, Tuesday.
— Our Steward has just gone ashore
under care of captain and the ablest-bodied
of our crew. Glad he got clear of the
yacht without catastrophe. So awkward
to have an exploded steward alongside,
especially when you 've just had the ship
painted a spotless white. Some story in
MARRYAT—I forget in which novel—where
a seafaring man (or was it a bum-boat
woman?), after a lifelong application to
the rum-bottle, lit his (or fler) pipe in
a casual way. The fumes of an old spirit-
cask, as it were, caught light, and the
verdict of the coroner s jury was "spon-
taneous combustion." Our Steward lit his
pipe as he tumbled into the boat. Happily
nothing happened.
It wasn't rum in the case of Our Stew-
:<rd, but methylated spirits of wine. Evi-
dence of its persuasiveness was visible when,
yesterday afternoon, we joined the yacht
for a cruise Skye-ward. Our Steward's
devotion to his duty was effusive but in-
effective. Going below to dress for dinner,
we found there were no lights.
"No lights!" said Our Steward, his face
beaming with desire to be of assistance;
"there soon shall be."
Produced box of matches; smote a score
on his breeches; as in most cases applica-
tion of the wrong end was made, result
disappointing. At last struck a light.
"Ah!" said Our Steward, turning to
survey us with radiant glance of bene-
volence prolonged till the light burned
down to his toil-worn fingers, and was cast
away on the newly-carpeted state-room
floor.
More matches struck; some lit; applied
to top of metal candlestick. Touching to
watch, in flickering light falling on Our
Steward's ruddy countenance, the look of
coaxing entreaty that made it irresistible.
"Come now," he said, cooing the candle-
stick as if it were a fretful infant that
wouldn't take its food.
Being merely a guest, didn't like to in-
terfere with trusted servant. At end of
looked at candlestick; found there was no
candle in it.
"Dear me, now," said Our Steward, hi<
face lighting up with beam of pleased
astonishment. "Think of that!"
Nothing disturbed him. At dinner, he
planted out a dish of cutlets in the flower-
pot; gently but firmly took away my soup
after I had had two spoonfuls; knocked
over a glass of champagne when handing
round the bread; and quite forgot the fish.
He was up bright and early in the
morning, joyous in the consciousness that
candles were not needed. Our berths were
under the dining-saloon, approached by
a steep flight of stairs. Soon after five,
Our Steward was about. Breakfast was
fixed for nine o'clock. In a well-ordered
ship there is nothing like being well ahead
of your work. So about half-past five
Our Steward began laying the cloth foi
breakfast. The process was long and mono-
tonous. It began with his bursting into the
dining-saloon and clattering down on the
table a handful of spoons and forks. Forks
seemed to bring to his mind the memory
of knives. Forth he went in search of

"WHEN A STREET is UP "—
. very old-fashioned and most effectual way of
them. But down below two people were
sleeping. It would never do in a chill
April morning to leave the deck-door open
on them. The draught might waken them,
if it did no worse. So Our Steward, flying
off to the galley, shut the saloon-door with
a bang like a pistol-shot.
Back again in no time, humming softly
to himself,
"A sailor's wife a sailor's star should be,
Toho! Toho!"
flung down on the table, quite in time,
a bundle of something I knew were knives;
softly whistled another bar of Nancy
Lee, whilst (I imagined) he regarded his
handiwork with that gaze of benevolent
interest he had last night bent upon the
amazingly empty candlesticks. Going out
again, and, still mindful of the comfort of
the sleeping passengers, he banged the
suloon-door as before.
Plates were his next prize. There was
no doubt about this, for he let one fall.
A low whistle of astonishment in which
there was just the slightest touch of irri-
tability at the perverseness of the thing,
followed. Then, lo! a strange thing hap-
pened. The door of my state-room was
wide open, in full view of the staircase.
I caught sight of a booted foot cautiously
descending. It was followed by another
foot, with nothing on but a stocking much
frayed at the heel. Gradually there came
into view a broad stern as of an East
Indiaman. It was Our Steward descending
the staircase backwards. What for,
Heaven only knows. As soon as he got to
the bottom, he, with the same stealthy
footstep, re-ascended, and the pistol-shot
of the closing saloon-door announced his
departure.
I fancy he must have thought he was
going out on deck to the galley, and did
not discover his mistake till he got to the
bottom of the stairs. Much touched by
his solicitude. Wouldn't wake us on any
account. Had evidently begun to takp
his boots off; thought he had completed
the iob. Meanwhile walked on tiptoe.
More dishes; more plates; and, as we
later discovered, tumblers instead of
teacups, set on the breakfast-table. A
finely subtle touch that. At half-nast six
he had nicely finished his work, and,
quarter of hour of futile match-striking,
surveying it, softly whistled a stave of
"Diverting the Traffic."

Nancy Lee. Another bang of the door;
a brief interval; he was back again.
I heard a trickling of water down the
staircase. Then the stockinged foot, com.
ing first this time, followed at considerable
interval by the booted heel. Soon the
rounded stern hove in sight; then the cap-
less head. It was Our Steward, breathing
heavily, depositing at the bottom of the
stairs a can containing what was left of our
hot water.
That was the last I saw of Our Steward,
save the parting view as he went ashore
in charge of the captain. The Commodore,
coming on deck and finding him a little
mixed, straightway ordered him to be put
on shore. An empty bottle that had con-
tained methylated spirits of wine, found in
the store cupboard, explained all.

Kimbcrley, March 21.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I write a few lines,
in the intervals of mosquito-slaying, in
praise of the Great Karroo and the railwaj
which bears you to the North across it.
1 will spare you a description of the Hex
River ascent, where the line plays a species
of cat's-cradle with itself up gradients of
one in forty, and where you have an
engine at each end of the train, which
seems, like a kitten, to be running after
its own tail, and where there is a "wash-
out" every other day or so, and the
sleepers go floating down a mountain-
torrent—let sleeping logs lie, 7 say. It is
the Karroo which takes my fancy. I don't
know where it begins or where it ends, but
there is enough of it for the most eagle
eye. There is a free and independent ring
about the very name, a mixture of halloo
and crow, exhilarating as the air which
blows across you at an altitude of four
thousand feet. As for the scenery, there
is bright red earth and low grey shrubs,
flat-topped kopjes, or hills, in plenty to
break the skyline, ant-hills in abundance,
an occasional herd or drove (which is itP)
of ostriches, a settler's hut or a tree at
intervals of about ten miles, and a thunder-
storm every day. What more do you
Then as to the train. When we parted
with the Johannesburg section at De Aar
Junction (look this out in Bradshaw) our
carriage was hitched on to a goods train
of eighteen trucks, which contained Kaffirs,
brandy-kegs, and other etceteras. It was,
I should say, a train specially adapted for
botanists, picnickers and pedestrians, as it
went so slowly up inclines that I got off
four times and picked flowers and generally
disarranged the landscape. The line is like
a switchback and goes up and down, and
also around any inconvenient hillock that
may be in the way. Some of the stations
are simply name-boards, nothing more, but
the names at any rate are familiar, e.g.,
Chalk Farm and Richmond Road, milM
from any habitation, out in the open rcld.
Then we bought a bottle of milk at Honey
Nest Kloof (a romantic name!), and when
we asked the dusky vendor if it was os-
triches' milk, he said, "Ah, yes!" and
nearly exploded as he disappeared round a
corner. He will probably relate to his
dying day the tale of the two confiding
pale-faces whom he once took in on a point
of natural history. Towards the end of
our pleasant thirty-six hours' run we in-
dulged in some shunting practice, with the
result that the carriage-lamp imitated
NEWTON'S apple, and fell within an inch
of the head of Yours precariously,
"No Larks!"

Kimberley, March 21.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—1 write a few lines,
in the intervals of mosquito-slaying, in
praise of the Great Karroo and the railway
which bears you to the North across it.
1 will spare you a description of the Hex
River ascent, where the line plays a species
of cat's-cradle with itself up gradients ol
on« in forty, and where you have an
engine at each end of the train, which
seems, like a kitten, to be running after
its own tail, and where there is a "wash-
out" every other day or so, and the
sleepers go floating down a mountain-
torrent—let sleeping logs lie, J say. It is
the Karroo which takes my fancy. I don't
know where it begins or where it ends, but
there is enough of it for the most eagle
eye. There is a free and independent ring
about the very name, a mixture of halloo
and crow, exhilarating as the air which
blows across you at an altitude of four
thousand feet. As for the scenery, there
is bright red earth and low grey shrubs,
flat-topped kopjes, or hills, in plenty to
break the skyline, ant-hills in abundance,
an occasional herd or drove (which is it?)
of ostriches, a settler's hut or a tree at
intervals of about ten miles, and a thunder-
storm every day. What more do you
Then as to the train. When we parted
with the Johannesburg section at De Aar
Junction (look this out in Bradshaw) our
carriage was hitched on to a goods train
of eighteen trucks, which contained Kaffirs,
brandy-kegs, and other etceteras. It was,
I should say, a train specially adapted for
botanists, picnickers and pedestrians, as it
went so slowly up inclines that I got off
four times and picked flowers and generally
disarranged the landscape. The line is like
a switchback and goes up and down, and
also around any inconvenient hillock that
may be in the way. Some of the stations
are simply name-boards, nothing more, but
the names at any rate are familiar, e.g.,
Chalk Farm and Richmond Road, milos,
from any habitation, out in the open rdil.
Then we bought a bottle of milk at Honey
Nest Kloof (a romantic name!), and when
we asked the dusky vendor if it was os-
triches' milk, he said, "Ah, yes!" and
nearly exploded as he disappeared round a
corner. He will probably relate to his
dying day the tale of the two confiding
pale-faces whom he once took in on a point
of natural history. Towards the end of
our pleasant thirty-six hours' run we in-
dulged in some shunting practice, with the
result that the carriage-lamp imitated
NEWTON'S apple, and fell within an inch
of the head of Yours precariously,
"No Larks!"

iIII.—THE SOCIAL KIND.
AMID the signs that indicate
The coming hurly-burly,
Cards for receptions, cool and late,
And others, warm and early,
The polo-match, the Church bazaar,
The dance of virgin gallants,
You read it—"Mrs. PUFFIN-PARR
At Home. To meet the Talents."
How well I know that woman's card I
It meets my weary eye on
The glass of every sucking-bard
And young dramatic lion I
And from enquiries I have made
I gather this about it—
No literary stock-in-trade
I spoke of her to THOMAS BBOWN
(GAWAYN LE BRCNE, he spelt it);
That author's literary frown
In specious laughter melted;
"' Who is she?' Well, she runs a kind
Of what we call a salon:
Where (see the notice) one may find
Tout ce qu'il y a de talent.
"But who my hostess is, or what
Her reason for existence,
These questions, frankly, I do not
Pursue with marked insistence;
I use her caravanserai,
Like other public hostels,
For meeting brother-genii,
The pick of Art's apostles."
"Take me," I said, "for I would know
Where men of light and leading go
And prattle by the legion;
Surely some spell of power untold
Lies hid behind those portals,
That lure within one common bower
So many rare Immortals."
In brief, I went. My host betrayed
A taste for my effusions;
To all my published works he made
Appropriate allusions;
Till in his ear my future themes
Were touchingly confided,
And when I left he knew my schemes
At least as well as I did.
Next week I chanced upon a "par"
Signed by "The Burrowing Badger " : —
"GAWAYN LE BRUNE, that nascent star,
Long noticed in the Cadger,
Hn done a volume, nearly due—
Frtnth Morals and the Ballet;
Last month, to catch the local hue,
He crossed (by sea) to Calais.
"His book, which nil should now secure,
Smacks of Ovimrs NASO,
With pholopraphs d'ajtrh nntufe,
Trte chir, if we may say so:
One of our younger rising firms,
PUSH, BROTHERS (doing nicely),
His bought the copyright on terms
Too high to quote precisely."
Much marvelling how my friend LE BRUNE
(Plain THOMAS BROWN, in private)
Such booming in the eye of noon
Could possibly connive at,
I read again : "JOHN JONKS" (that 'a me) —
"His smart elucidation
Of HABAKKUK will prove, on dit,
A perfect revelation."
Kull details followed. I had been
The victim of a vulture,
A feeder off the fat, or lean,
Of other people's culture;
A licensed literary tout
Who battens on his betters,
And runs the column—"Chats about
The Chiefs of Art and Letters."
So was I taught the mystic truths
Of mutual market dealings
Beneath n social salve that soothes
The artist's finer feelings;
How host and guest work hand in hand
On lines a little greasy,—
The enterprising squeezer and
The enterprising squeezee.
A HAPPY HOLIDAY.
Now I really do not care a
Hang about the Riviera,
In the daytime you 've a gay time,
But the nights are very cold.
And for any kind of touring
Which I used to find alluring,
I for biking had a liking,
But I now have grown too old.
Then the constant change of weather,
To my thinking, altogether
Knocked the notion of an ocean
Trip completely on the head;
I Ve a horror, too, of "trippers,"
'Arrys, 'Arriets, and "nippers,"
So a jolly quiet holi-
Day I spent at home in bed.

For I 'm an unwilling dog-dandy; a hard case I

I 'm stupid, short-winded, and fat as a pig;
A mere waddling wardrobe, with misery inside it.
My togs—so I 'm told—are worth full twenty pounds,
My toilet-club, doctor, and tailor cost money.
And though with my mistress that freely abounds
To waste it on making me wretched seems funny.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN Dearer than Honour (HtJTCHiNSON) E. LrvnrGSTON PRESCOTT
has very nearly written a big book. If he had treated this first
version as a rough note-book, left out some episodes and written
in others, he (or isn't it she ?) might have succeeded. The germ
thought is a noble one; but it grows amid rank weeds of impos-
sibility. My Baronite is not disposed to insist upon the prosaic
in romance land. It is quite conceivable that a man of Ludovic
OnFs supremely fine nature might have sacrificed and suffered
nil he did for the sake of the girl he loved. But he would require
some further proof of necessity than was supplied by the machi-
nations of the melodramatic villain Fin ucane. Moreover, all the
scenes in connection with Sister Sophia are ludicrously out of
drawing. That the author feels these truths is indicated by the
sub-title, A Fool's Trageiy. But why make such an incredible
fool?
A Soldier of Manhattan (SMITH, ELDER) fought at Ticonderoga,
and, under the leadership of WOLFE, stormed the heights that Ted
to the Plains of Abraham and the conquest of Quebec. Mr.
JOSEPH ALTSHELER has evidently made painstaking study of the
period, and reproduces its episodes and characters with com-
mendable fidelity. But his hand lacks the magic touch with
which some earlier workers in the field of historical romance are
gifted. His men and women are woefully woodeny, and his
battle scenes, carefully drawn from the best records, lack the
glow of fire. Withal, the book is, my Baronite says, well worth
reading, as dealing with a little-studied episode in the history of
the Empire.
With much gratification hath the Baron read Mr. S. E. CROCK-
ETT'S Lochinvar (METHUEN), a spirited romance full of doughty
deeds, clanging and clashing of weapons, firing of pistols, hair-
breadth escapes, strange Scotch language unintelligible to the
pock-pudding Englishman, skirmishes, and such a surfeit of
exciting sensational scenes as would have sufficed Sir WALTER
SCOTT as material for three novels, and a modern dramatist for at
least a couple of melodramas. And that the essential "female
interest" should not be lacking, Mr. CROCKETT gives us two full-
blown heroines, one of whom he is compelled to kill, and two
other fledgling heroines, whose necessary disappearance from the
story causes a pang of regret to the reader, as it must have done
to the author. But why doth Mr. CROCKETT so gently treat his
melodramatic villains? Of course, as he lets down his arch-
scoundrel easily, he is in justice compelled to permit the aforesaid
arch-villain's "creatures" to escape scot-free. Alas! that it
should be so, for up to the very end did not the Baron, with
palpitating heart and bated breath, await some awful catastrophe
which should put an end, and in excruciating tortures too, to
"the Butcher, the Calf, and the Killer "? If "my Lord Barra"
be permitted to escape, as he is, then hath mercy, and not justice,
prevailed with the romancer. With real pleasure does the Baron
recommend to all lovers of bustling melodramatic romance Mr.
CROCKETT'S stirring and picturesque story of Lochinvar.
In The Lust of Hate (WARD, LOCK & Co.), GUY BOOTHBY
makes use of his own Dr. Nikola as "Diabolus ex machind,"
and as that mysterious, necromatic scoundrel is not brought to
an untimely end, it is presumable that he may be ready to hand
whenever his agency is again required for some other audaci-
ously-schemed plot. The story, in which the situation of ship-
wrecked hero and heroine on a desert island vividly recalls a few
of the incidents in CHARLES EEADE'S Foul Play, is exciting; but
the denouement is inartistic, being not only too evident, but far
too abrupt. In fact, the story is spoilt in order to give Dr.
Nikola a chance of being ready when wanted for " Mr. BOOTHBY'S
next." What a pity it is that Mr. Sherlock Holmes cannot be
revived in order to be pitted against the nefarious Dr. Nikola /
A poor family happy. I feel like a hog:

some 50,000 feet into the valley of the Lincrusta River, wandering
like a streak of molten lead in the realm of the Unknown. I felt
the two-bladed razor on each of my feet. It cut both my corns
and my toe-nails. At the same time CRUM-TATO presented a re-
volver at my head. It pressed my forehead, but at that moment
I perceived "by glancing down the barrel that it was net loaded.
There was a great pause, during which I took some shorthand
notes and drew a picture of the sufferings of GINOAII SNAP and
ORANO PIP. Tho ruffian and his satellites hesitated to finish
their work, and as they discussed the situation, I winked iu covert
fashion to my comrades. It was enough! In an instant we had
armed ourselves with some cocoa-nuts, which border-gipsies on
their way to Lhassa Races had abandoned by reason of the death
of their donkeys. Our cowardly opponents fled before our well-
directed shower of missiles. I rapidly released my companions,
and we were free! free! free! for we had only to skip the frontier,
leaving behind us some undesirable Yaks and those instruments
of torture which have never been seen in Europe, and probably
never will be. The British Resident was absent, but we were
"all there."
KING CRICKET.
THE canny Scot may talk a lot
Of golf and its attraction,
And " putt " and " tee" for him may be
A source of satisfaction;
While maidens meek with rapture speak
Of croquet's fascination,
Tho' I suspect 'twere more correct
To call their game "flirtation."
But cricket's the thing for Summer and
Spring I
Three cheers for cricket, of all games the
king I
The man who boats his time devotes
To rowing or to sailing,
In shine or rain he has to train,
With energy unfailing.
A tennis set finds favour yet
With merry men and matrons.
In lazy souls the game of bowls
Is not without its patrons.
A day that's fine I do opine
Is much to be desired;
An "even pitch " I ask for, which
Is certainly required;
Then add to that a " steady bat,"
A bowler " on the wicket,"
A "field" that's "smart," then we can
start
The noble game of cricket.
A PARADISE for whist-players and mas-
sage-patients should be found (judging by

drawbridge and entered the castle. In
those Saxon times only some half-dozen
retainers stood awaiting strangers in the
hall. The Danes had taught the inhabi-
tants of the British IsJes a certain measure
of prudence, but yet they retained their
freedom.
"Is the lady of the house at home?"
asked the aristocratic caller, throwing the
reins of his horse to a lackey.
"At your service, my lord, but the
countess, who is partial to cookery, is in
the kitchen," was the respectful resronse.
"Thither will I go and serve as my
own introducer." Saying this, the hunts-
man found his way to the lower regions.
The counters was certainly making cakes.
She had around her a number of subtle
essences and sauces, and in front of her
was a book of home, gorgeously illumi-
nated, containing valuable culinary recipes.
"Fair lady, pardon this intnision, but
I am a bit of a chef myself. Can I help

The countess evidenced some confusion.

"How dare you?" she cried. "How

"A blow!" he exclaimed, pale with
rage. Then he blew his horn. In a mo-

"Take that woman," he continued,
pointing at the now trembling countess,
"to the deepest dungeon under the castle

The lady was loaded with chains.
"Who is this tyrant—this lawless ty-

"Why, lady, the king."

DEAREST ARABELLA,—Now that all the world is on wheels, of
course you also go in for "biking"; AMY rides in the Park every
day in knickers.
To a country mouse like yourself, love, this may at first seem
un peu rioqne, but noMfsse oblige, could she do better than follow
the example set by the Duchess of TRINKTJMALEE and the really
smart set in the world of fashion? I think not.
You must be dying to know all about EVA'S wedding; as you
are aware, she married the Hon. BERTIE BOUNDER, the best-
dressed man in London, so 'tis said; the ceremony was celebrated
at the now fashionable church of St. Giles, before the Bishop of
BATTERSEA, assisted by the Vicar of VAUXHALL and three curates,
so there 19 every reason to believe that she was properly tied up.
The bride's uncle, "old Kangaroo" as he is called, gave her
away (entre nous, he made his money in the tea trade, "Kangaroo
Hill Brand," hence his soubriquet). As JACK SIIARPE remarked
in an audible whisper, "Given away with a pound of tea." Clever,
was it not? But JACK never lets a chance slip of saying a smart
thing. After the ceremony there was a reception at the Polony
Hotel, where most of the presents were on view. I counted
fifteen pepper-castors and eighteen salt-cellars, so EVA is nicely
set up in this respect.
She had fourteen bridesmaids and six pages dressed in CHARLES
THE PIRST costume; a full description of the bridesmaids' dresses
and the bride's trousseau is held over until mjr next.
Here is a nice recipe for a light luncheon dish:
Take half a pound of liver and three red herrings (mind that
they are red"), cut in thin strips, and stew gently over a slow fire,
break the yolks of half-a-dozen plovers' eggs, pepper lightly with
parmesan, add two or three cloves and a cupful of the finest
golden syrup, dust all over with red pepper, and serve en canape.
Ever your devoted, SOPHONISBA.
OUR FIREWORKS
(By Jones Major.)
THEY were a distinct success. Every one knows TORCHB'S
Guinea Box (17s. 9J. at the Stores) and all its treasures. We
were a little perplexed at the instructions. There was one thing
looking like an old-fashioned dress-improver that had some-
thing on it about putting a greased string through it. Well,
SMITH Minor got the twine of his peg-top and held it with
another fellow, and I lighted it. It fizzled, and then flew in a
fury of red and green flames. SMITH Minor dropped it like a
hot potato, and then the beastly thing followed us, throwing
coloured balls at us now and again and letting off crackers. Then
we had a partial failure with our rocket. It went up all right for
about three yards and then turned to the left and kept in that
direction. It was amusing to see the leisurely way in which it
set to work. No hurry—to speak of—for a rocket. Then there
were the roman candles. Splendid when none of the fellows
were fooling. However, one was started off sideways, and
nearly set fire to a haystack. For all that it was most effective,
and caused a perfect thrill of excitement. Then we had a Jack-
in-the-box. We didn't know how to light it. Bub BINKB
Minimus (who is a plucky little chap for his inches) held it in
his hand until it began fizzing. It was a quiet, well-conducted
flame at first—quite delicate. Then, suddenly—without a bang
of warning—it began cracking about all over the shop. Poor
BINKS got a number of nasty burns. Then there was a thing
called "The Golden Grove Tree." We put it on a stick, and
instead of remaining there it jumped down and twirled about on
the ground. It looked very pretty, and we shouldn't have minded
it much, but it would let oft fire-balls at us. The roman candles
were all right because we knew what they would do, and they
did it. No humbug about them. They were quite a relief to an
affair with twists and twirls and a long touch-piece, that was
called "A Mexican Treasure," and went off with a fizz sideways
and blazed away in the greenhouse. The balloon was all right
though it did come down on a haystack that would get in its way
while it was descending. By great good luck the spirits of wine had
burned themselves out, so there was no accident.
Our last effect was to let off everything that was left simulta-
neously. Rockets, catherine-wheels (from 5s. apiece to 6d. a
dozen), squibs, and crackers. It certainly was glorious, but
might have been better had not the various lights killed one
another. At the end of the performance we found a greenhouse
alight, ditto a haystack, ditto the goals in the football field.
Besides these slight casualties there were a few odds and ends,
such as a smashed library window and a scorched rabbit-hutch.
But for all that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and trust
that old Dr. BIRCHWELL (our excellent head master, whose birth-
day occurred just after our return to school from the Easter
vacation) fully appreciated our efforts to do him appropriate
honour.

MERRY MAY.
(By a Sufferer, in anticipation, from its
Merriment.)
“CAST not a clout till May be out !”
Oh! sound advice, sagacious giver!
Had I but heeded it, no doubt,
I should have spared my liver.
Oh! merry, merry month of May 1
Only your jests are merry, merry,
'Tis only pretty Springtide's way,
And humorous—ah, very /
The joke of bringing blossoms out
By frost and the east wind to perish,
Is a sweet pleasantry, no doubt,
All humorists should cherish.
The jape of tempting flannels off
By one mild morning, warm and sunny
Followed by hail-storms and a cough,
Is most supremely funnyl
Oh! merry May, you find your mirth
At human misery in mocking;
So vou're the merriest fiend on earth;
To me such mirth is shocking!
Crackling of thorns beneath the pot
Is mellow music to your laughter.
We smile at May's poetic rot,
And you at what comes after.
To see men suffer, hear men cuss,
To May, no doubt, is vastly jolly;
But to transfer May's mirth to us
Is muddle-headed folly.

INTERESTING AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE.
(By Cable from our fljircial Correspondent, in
spitf.ofthe War.)
MR. ABRAHAM P. QUICKSF.TT, who last
year purchased the "Spread Eagle Hotel,"
li -Hiiixii 11,i City (Mo.), has just financed
the Washington Axe Caravanserai in Flo-
rida to the extent of two million dollars,
with a proviso that all alligators on the
estate shall be considered as real property.
He has entered into a large contract with
an enterprising firm of bootmakers.
Last night, Mrs. HIRAM P. BRIQUETTE,
wife of the eminent coal merchant, gave
a ball at the Thousand Street Hotel. Mrs.
BRIQUETTE, who was appropriately robed
in sombre tulle decorated with flame-
coloured lace and black diamonds, received
her guests in the entrance lobby. Mr.
BRIQUETTE superintended the cloak depart-
ment. Many members of the old Kicker-
nocker families were present, among whom
I may mention Miss POLLY SCISSORS, the
well-known blonde, Miss MINNIK VAN
KORK, Miss KATRINE HOOK DB HOLLAND,
Mrs. CHORTUSR, the charming bride of Mr.
EFHRAIM CHORTLER (ne THORNBUSH, of
Wall Street), and the Terra del Fuego at-,
tache.
There has been a rumour lately (and I',
may add, not without foundation) that
Senator CINCINNATCS PORKOPOLIS of Cin-
cinnati has been in treaty with the British
Government for the sale of Windsor Castle
tor PORKOPOLIS, it should be mentioned, is
one of our most respected citizens. He
began life by making boot-laces out of
straw at St. Louis (Mo.), and later on by
his industry succeeded in getting a clerk-
ship in the house of SCBATCHEM & Co., the
famous brush-makers. Attracted by the
value of swine, he soon obtained a corner
in the breed, and adopted a name, which
is now (registered) to be found in any
World's Directory. Miss MARIE ANTOI-
NETTE POINSETTIA JANE PORKOPOLIS, his
daughter, is, whether or no her father's
stupendous offer for the British Public
Buildings be accepted, certain to be the
leading belle at Buckingham Palace this
season. She has resolved to accept no
husband lower than an English Duke or a
German Prince.
A novelty in the matter of supper-parties
has been arranged by Mr. CALEB X. CHIP-
MUNK, perhaps the most enterprising of our
"blue bloods." He has taken the whole of
the "Rip Van Winkle Restaurant," and
bidden for Thursday next a select number

white costnmes. Thus (so I am given to I
understand), Mrs. CYRUS PADDER, the most
fashionable lady corseti&re, who owns six
blocks of houses, is to represent a white
peacock, her husband, a genial member of
our leading clubs, a white owl, Mr. and
Mrs. WASHINGTON BROWN-.TONES-SMITH-
ROBINSON a pair of turtle-doves, Count
CHINKO the silver dollar, and Mrs. MAO-
THE SCORCHER.
HE travels along at the top of his speed,
You might think that his life was at
stake;
To beauties of nature he never pays heed,
For the record he 's trying to break.
He stiffens his muscles and arches his back
As if he were still on the cinder-path track.
He races regardless of life and of limb,
Caring naught for the folk in his way;
For chickens and children are nothing to
him,
And his mad career nothing can stay;
So wildly he wheels as if urged by a goad;
By coachmen he's christened "the curse
of the road."
He '11 pass on the left and he '11 ride on the
right,
For the rules of the road caring naught;
His lamp he will not take the trouble to
light
Till a pretty smart lesson he 's taught.
But lecture and fine him as much as you
will,
The trail of the scorcher is over him still.

A WORD TO THE WISE.
JUDOLWO by the experience of our own "Travelling Fellow"
and of his fellow-travellers, we should say that the Me'tropole
Hotel, at Folkestone, is very hard to beat, as being one of the most
spacious, most luxurious, and best conducted, on fairly reason-
able terms, that the aforesaid travellers have patronised for some
considerable time. It is dangerous to praise. A hotel, woman-
like, is "varium et mutabile temper," depending so entirely on
those who are " here to-day and gone to-morrow," and not back
again at all if dissatisfied. Therefore, let this hostelry, now in
its youth, keep up to the mark and be careful not to allow the
menu of to-day to be inferior to that of yesterday, but ever to
give promise of even still better things to-morrow, and to see that
the promise is fulfilled. Our Travelling Fellow, being inspired to
ask a puzzler, wishes to know why the Metropole is like one of
three Spanish matadors who have been tossed by a bull in the
arena? The answer, he says, is because the hotel is "one of the
Gored 'uns!" (Meaning, as we infer, "one of the Gordons.")

With private engagements here to keep?

OH, a sailor's life is the life for me,
Lashed by the bounding, sounding sou,
With the blue above and the bilge below,
And a general sense of Yo-heave-ho!
But how can I ride on the wrathful deep
With private engagements here to keep?
I would love to lather the open main
Under the yellow and red of Spain;
To wield command—and a mild Manilla—
Right in the van of the old flotilla;
But something tells me I 'm not to roam,
For piety best begins at home.
I sniff the tootle of war's alarms,
Where the young Canaries are up in arms;
And I feel the edge of my keen Toledo,
Sharp as the snout of a trim torpedo:
But Princes are shackled by rights divine,
And one of them is—to draw the line.
Think what n Monte-Carloist feels
When Aragon calls and the two Castiles!
For the ban is out and the arriere-ban,
And Spain mint fight to her last true man;

And I flatter myself it would be the deuce
If I were away and the lot broke loose.
Here from my singular sea-girt rock,
In a manner of speaking, I feed my flock;
I guard their ways from the enemy's wiles
Over a surface of eight square miles!
What, if I went, would be their fate,
Fleeced by the stranger within my gate?
Hungry he comes from East and West,
Welcomed at large (as a paying finest),
Though his soul is full of the fell intent
Of breaking the source of my hard-earned

Where the flower of Monaco grind my mill,
Toiling and spinning the fretful pill.

recent developments.)
I ENTERED the study. It was in the
customary condition of confusion, showing
that the occupant had the most elemen-
tary Wens anent order.
"What do you want?" was the first
question put to me.
"To make a few inquiries," was my
prompt reply.
"I can attend to nothing; I am too
busy."
"It would not appear so," I returned
with a smile. "You seem to have ample
leisure. And that reminds me that I want
five pounds."
"If you expect me to provide it, you
will have to wait a considerable time before
receiving the desired sum."
"Indeed 1 Why can you not let me have
it?"
"Because I cannot afford it. Times are
hard just now."
This gave me the opening I desired, and
I took advantage of the opportunity to
press it.
"What do you mean bv hard? That
the rates are unpaid and the rent in
arrears?"
"Well, certainly, I have received a final
application for the first, and a second
notice for the last."
"How about the household books?"
"They are, so I am eiven to understand,
very much in arrears."
"Dear me! Then you are scarcely sol-
vent?"
"Well, that is putting it rather too
strongly," said my interviewee. "I believe
I can pay my way if I am given time."
"However," I returned, with a smile, "I
suppose you would prefer to keep the pre-
sent condition of your affairs a secret from
the world at large?"
"No doubt; no doubt."
"Then if you are so good as to hand me
five pounds, we will forget all about it."
"I have already explained that I cannot
renl'v afford tbe expenditure."
"Then it will be my painful duty to pub-
lish a report of our interview—as a warn-

"You will do no such thing."

Employee. I think, Sir, you are quite
satisfied with my conduct?
Employer. Unquestionably. During the
long time you have been in my service you
have merited my most perfect confidence.
Employee. Then, Sir, I would ask you to
confer upon me a great favour. You know
my salary?
Employer. One well earned. For all you
do, it is poor wages. You manage all my
correspondence. You invest all my savings,
and you are the life and soul of every en-
terprise I undertake. It would be impos-
sible to recompense you to the extent of
the obligation under which you have placed
me. Moat certainly, your salary is well
earned. It amounts to seven hundred and
fifty guineas a year.
Emp'oyee. I beg you, Sir, to change that
sum from guineas to pounds.
Employer. A strange request! Why, that
would reduce your salary to £699—with a
few odd shillings!
Employee. True, Sir; but had I less than
£700 a year I could claim to be assessed at
£70 a year less than my full revenue by
the authorities on the income tax.
Emplover. But surely that would be of
no benefit to you? Mind, the income tax
is to-day only at 8d.
Employee. I know, Sir; but things have

to go but slightly wrong and the impost
will rush up to 5«. and over. Say that the
CHANCELLOH OF THE EXCHEQUER has made
a slight miscalculation in the number of
moribund millionaires, say that there is an
alteration in the taste for cocoa—with the
smallest encouragement the income tax
would rise by leaps and bounds. So, good
Sir, change, I pray you, my salary from
guineas to pounds.

Employee. A thousand thanks! And now
I am insured for the future.

Such votive offering for his salvation.
Now I am one, who "walked" a wretched

Out of a pack, and found it my dam-

For, once invested with the fair renown
Of being a sportsman and a man of

I found the title I could not lay down,
And was obliged, although my seat is
funny,
And hands are vile, and I do hate a horse
(Which is, as Pinchbold said, a fearful
creature),
To hunt a season, and to fall of course
Right often, spoiling many a lovely
feature,
And much discomfited upon the ground.
And so I thank the Fates for their for-

And pretty much my usual appearance.
With grateful heart I bid farewell to this,
My first and last experience of hunting.

FLITTTNGS.
Bloemffmtein, March 28, 1898.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I cannot go to bed
without telling you that lumber-ley is a
Rreat, consolidated Fact. Everything there
is "consolidated." For instance, opposite
our hotel (we were staying there last week)
was a Consolidated Hair-dressing and Shav.
ine Saloon. The whole place is DE BEERS,
but as for the original DE BEERS bimsplf,
the eponymous hero of the city of dia-
monds, no two people whom I asked told
me the same story as to what h«s become
of him, and nobody seems to care.
If you could spare me a dozen columns
of rour valuable space, I would attempt
a description of a diamond mine. It
can't be properly done in less. But to
give a few concentrated impressions might
be possible. There are the "floors," where
the precious "blue" soil (it is a slaty-
green) is laid out for six months and
harrowed; there are vnst mud-shoots
where you could toboggan for a hundred
yards down a slnnting sea of mud; there
is the Pulsator, which pulsates, and kicks
up a deafening din, preventing you hearing
yourself think, but picking out the precious
stones in various ingenious and unerring
manners; the crushing-rooms, where an
engine of about a million cab-horse power
is at work; the various "compounds,"
wired over like a chicken-nm, where thou-
sinds of niggers are fenced in for months
at a time, but they don't seem to mind it;
the little cars which run about by them-
selves, resembling insects; the vice-chair-
man of the company, who lent us bis "cape-
oart" for the day, and tantalised us with
a sight of a long tableful—not a table-
spoonful—of diamonds, just half a week's
catch. In fact, a very great deal of trouble
many Kaffirs employed, and the whole
place turned upside down, all to produce
a few glittering specks of consolidated car-
bon. However, I suppose ladies will go
about wearing them, so it is no use my
protesting.
DE BEKRS do everything in grand style—
they have even got a model village, Kenil-
worth, for pattern people to live in. One
only wishes they would run a railway across
to Bloemfontein, ninety miles as the crow
flies—only it doesn't fly in these parts—
instead of taking us a day's journey round
three sides of a very elongated oblong.

SHAKSPEARE ON WHITE "UNMENTIONABLES.'
(Formerly taken into wear by the Sritiih Army
on the firit of May.)
"Ah, sweet Ducks!"
Time is not money here. An answer
given in a physical geography class at one
of the Kimberley schools is a propos.
When asked what was the difference in
time between London and Kimberley, the
pupil replied that Kimberley time was
slower. "Waag een bitje., baas" (wait a
bit, Sir), is the motto in South Africa,
where they understand the virtue of hast-
ening slowly.
Yours perforce featining lently,
Z.Y.X.
MORE NEWS OF A FASHIONABLE PLA-
NET.—"Mart" has been announced, and
should have arrived ere this appears, for
Mara has already been heralded by " Pars"
in various newspapers. The name of its
authoress (for of course it should be an
authoress who writes about Mars) is Mrs.
DARLING BABKBR. It excites sympathy,
for, which of us, having suffered bronchi-
ally and "barked" till we nearly had a fit,
can avoid a feeling of tender pity for a
darling barker? We wish every success
to M(irs.
A Dubious Compliment.

BITY, just returned from Scotland). Have

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTKACTKI) FROM THF DlAHV OF TOHY, II. P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 18.
—Black Monday at Westminster. Boys
back at school wistfully wondering whether
providential incursion of influenza, or
beneficent epidemic of measles, may not
presently impose another holiday. Mean-
while get into Committee of Supply on
Civil Service Estimates. Attendance
sparse; but CALDWELL all over the shop.
Determined to make up for enforced silence
of past ten days. Began on first vote on
account of public offices. Why should
Scotland pay for London Custom House,
St. Martin's-le-Grand, and the like? Later
on, vote for Royal Palaces called up.
First Commissioner forthwith summoned
to lay low the wall that frowns on the
public from the frontage of Buckingham
Palace gardens; to fling wide the doors
of the mansion, and let CALDWKLL, repre-
senting British public, roam at large where
Kings and Queens have strayed. Up again
when vote submitted for sustentation of
Royal Parks and pleasure grounds.
"Why should these be charged on the
estimates?" he sternly asked. "Let them
be maintained by the local bodies."
One comfort about CALDWELL, regarded
as Parliamentary orator, is that he cherishes
no trivial prejudice about such matters as
an audience, or of notice being taken by
subsequent speakers of his remarks. To-
For all reply, the Minister in charge of
votes bestowed upon him a patient smile.
This neglect would kill some people. The
man whom Mid-Lanarkshire delights to
honour is absolutely indifferent. The
homely hen, as SAKK says, makes nothing
out of the egg she lays. She does not eat
it boiled or fried. Yet such sordid con-
sideration does not prevent her from loudly
clacking in generous delight at her unsel-
fish achievement. So CALDWELL cackles.
Though in justice to the hen it must be
admitted that the feathered biped has the
advantage of reflecting that, as a prelimi-
nary, it has added something substantial
to the welfare of mankind.
Jtuxinfits dune.—Rattled through Supply.
All votes on paper passed by half-past
eight. Klysian days for the Treasury.
Tuesday. — Sp*ent pleasant instructive
afternoon with the doctors. Only draw-
back to perfect enjoyment was the attitude
and aspect of CHAPLIN on Treasury Bench.
He, good man. had come down to pass
Vaccination Bill through second reading.
As our dear GRANDOLPH " forgot GOSCHEN,"
he forgot WALTER FOSTER, and eke Sir
PRIESTLEY. A moment's reflection might
have convinced him that those learned pun-
dits were not likely to scamp rare oppor-
tunity of delivering lecture on so interesting
and attractive a subject as Vaccination.
For his turn WALTER FOSTER had advan-
tage of a table. In the absence of a sick
bed a table indispensable to clinical lecture.
Pretty to see how the Emeritus Professor
to time critically eyed the mace stretched
on the table, where in other circumstances
"the corp" would have been conveniently
disposed. But if the learned author of
"Valvular Diseases of the Heart " had the
table at his disposal, the tormer Professor oi
Obstetrics in King's College had " the corp,"
as it were, under his tuum-b. Vvnen lie
rose from the Bench immediately behind
Ministers, put on his spectacles, and pro-
duced wnat looked uncommonly dike a
washing book containing his notes, Alem-
bers on either side discreetly moved away,
laaving him a clear space. Who could say
that, reaching some abstruse portion of his
argument, he might not turn to the man
nearest to him, direct him to take off his
coat, and proceed to use his bust for a series
of illustrations? The hapless President of
the Local Government Board sat imme-
diately below the learned PRIESTLEY, in
sole possession of the Treasury Bench. The
Profassor had merely to lean over, take up
the limp arm, and baring it to the shoulder
in full view of the crowded cla«s, show the
difference between the operation of vacci-
nation when lymph is gleaned from the
three acres, and when it is drawn direct
from the cow.
CHAPLIN, not unconscious of the risk he
ran, was too dispirited to observe the pre-
caution followed by Members who shared
the back bench with the lecturer. As the
quarters of an hour sped, each more
mauraix than the other, his chin sank lower
on his breast; his face grew more sallow

eye-glass. Sitting roust needs close at ten
minutes to seven. If Bill not read second
time to-day, its chances of passing this
Session grievously imperilled. The lecture
evidently only half delivered; pages of the
washing book still filled with profound
analysis, sound diagnosis, advice not else-
where dispensed under two guineas a visit.
When it was over, there was no time for
debating the Bill, and debate stood ad-
journed.
Business done.—None.
Thursday.—Next to the blood of the
martyrs, nothing more precious than the
pleasantry of the CHANCELLOR OF THE EX-
CHE IUER. Compared with his position as
a humourist the judge on the bench, or
the police-court magistrate, is not in it.
In the latter case it is understood that
much is expected from the Usher. A can-
didate with a broad smile and a lusty laugh
is said, in the neighbourhood of Bow
Street, to have overwhelming chances for
promotion to a vacancy. With us the
nearest approach to the Usher is the Mes-
senger. But if to-night, when ST. MICHAEL
was convulsing the Court—I mean the
House—with laughter, any of the estima-
ble officials stationed either at the bar or
behind the SPEAKER'S chair, had presumed
to lead off the laughter, he would have
received a month's notice.
There was, in truth, no need of friendly
or professional assistance to make ST.
MICHAEL'S jokes go off. "I tried a little
sermon on economy two years ago," he
said; and Lord! how we laughed. "It
had no more effect on the rest of the
House (laughter)—especially on my own
colleagues (roars of laughter)—than if it
had been delivered in Church." (Shrieks
of laughter, amid which a stout Member
above the gangway, conscious of a ten-
dency to apoplexy, discreetly withdrew.)
rival of SYDNEY SMITH was when he slyly
observed that he is "an abstainer both
from tea and tobacco." We laughed so
that, really, he could not continue for a
moment or two. When in the cool of the
evening we come to analyse this particular
joke, the ingredients ssem scanty. But
a joke isn't a quart of milk, or a pound of
butter, that you may send round to the

HONOURED SIB,—In these days, when
Ten Thousand Pounds Stakes are growing
as rapidly as Mushrooms in a Norfolk or
Suffolk pasture, it seems almost invidious
DO allude to that Classic Contest known as
the Two Thousand Guineas; but thank
goodness! there are still Patrons of the
rurf, to say nothing of the G. G. P. (or
Great General Public), who cling to old
Favourites with the Tenacity of the pro-
verbial Ivy for the Immortal Oak, and pre-
fer to win fewer Pieces with more Honour.
By them, the race for the Guineas is always
looked upon as the Stepping-stone to the
Derby, as is the latter yet another help
onwards towards the Doncaster Leger.
But speaking from a Comparative point of
view, how rarely has the Triple Crown of
the Turf been bestowed on the Heroes of
the Flat! There have been Giants over the
three Courses, and also a great many
Dwarfs. As my-respected grandsire used
to observe when comparing our Ancient
Aristocracy with the "Newvowretches"

Catalogue says 'tis "Mr. Littler, Q.G." "LITTLER" is a
"ptrtonti grata." By the way, while on the subject, jusb drop
into Qallery No. 3, and look at
No. 189. Encore HEBKOMER, E.A. Admirable! "A Tight
Fit." Here is more lace, and of a very superior quality to that
worn by the gentleman who hangs out at No. 23. Judging by
the expression of the unfortunate individual's countenance, he is
sadly regretting his happy home, his easy smoking-jacket, and
comfortable slippers.
No. 76. "The Turned Head." By MILLET. An uncommonly
stiff-necked Puritan, who has got his head so awry that nothing
but a surgical operation will ever restore it to its normal position.
No. 138. Here, Mr. EDWIN ABBEY, A., with great wealth
of colour, shows how an obstinate young lady in yellow and green
refuses to learn a new step which an affected dancing-mistress is
smilingly insisting on teaching her. As the recalcitrant damsel
is inclined to turn nasty and say rude things, she is being coaxed
away by a gentleman with a glorified pincmhion on his head. A
hound, quite ashamed of the proceedings, 19 going awiy in the
wake of an exhausted pupil, who, having finished her lesson, is
being led out, staggering. It will probably be as popular as is
the artist himself, for, say his admirers to him,'' What's the odds
as long as you 're ABBEY?"
No. 152. By STANHOPE A. FORBES, A. Little child who has
been playing, during service time, in the churchyard, is pursued
by the sexton, and caught by her grandmother, who is coming
out with her prayer-book. Little girl evidently has no tara-
diddle ready. Pathetic picture. Notice the remarkable roof of
the church, apparently formed out of one solid piece of slate!!
No. 198. This will be the picture of the year. If it isn't, " we're
another/' that's all. Three cheers for the "Bits of rare Old
('helsea," here collected and exhibited by HUBERT HERKOMF.R,
R.A. "God save the Queen!" shout the soldiers of the "Old
Guard" 01 Jubilee Day; and the colour of their coats, of their
left hands, and of the drapery, signifies their "reddioess" once
more to serve their Queen and Country !" Rouge Ragne!"
No. 2J2. Dsliphted to welcome the work of the President, Sir
catalogued number of the work is its bert description, No. 222.
Yes! as the slang of the Esthetes used to have it, "It »'« quite
Ton two two 11"
No. 233. Portrait of a Gentleman, who explains his sad case
thus :—" My wife says, that even on a hot summer day I must
not stand to an artist to have my portrait painted unless I wear
my thick fur-trimmed overcoat." H. T. WELLS, R.A. "Done in
Oil Wdh"
No. 243. "Dangerous Practical Joke." Gentlomin fast asleep,
with head and arms on table, decanter emptied. Disgraceful, of
c luree; but the lady, pardonably annoyed, is not justified in her
attempt to draw his chair away suddenly, and bring him to the
ground. One glanse at the colouring will show that it comes
from the hand of the mister, W. Q. ORCIIARDSON, R.A.
No. 228. Charming portrait. Butwhytbh dissatisfied expres-
sion when being painted by ORCHARDSON ?" Oh, smile as thou
wert wont to smile!"
No. 258. Who is it? At first glance, without reference to
guide, it will be probably taken for a very indifferent present-
ment of H.R.H. Prince of WALES figuring, it may be, in some
official costume proper to his dignity as Duke of CORNWALL,
allowance being made for the colour of the roba detracting from
the facial resemblance, just as " circumstances alter cases "; but
if it isn't, who is it? [For solution of puzzle, refer to guide,
No. 258; ask for No. 258, and see that you get it, as on Press-
view Day it was labelled No. 237, which is'Mr. BRAMLEY'B portrait
of "A Sadler " (not a bit leathery, but he is very much "up in
the stirrups"), while No. 258 is Lord MrnLETON, by WALTER
URWICK, who has not employed much "middle tone" in this
picture.]
No. 305. "'Poppy' Lwd." Lady, after picnic lunch and
plenty of "Pop," somehow wanders away, and gets holds of a
scythe. She has her eyes shut to her danger, and a Pickwickian
smile illuminates her c rantenance. She " cuts a pretty figure "—
es she will do, pretty severely too, if that scythe isn't taken away
from her. H. A. OLIVIER.
No. 347. Represents a trial at Quarter Sessions in the old
Justice-room of the very ancient Town Hall of Sandwich. No
one, but the veriest Goth, could possibly have wanted this
splendid old oak-panelling painted and varnished! One would
as soon have it white-washed all over. But H. WEIQALL has done
it, "to order" presumably, and immortalised himself by his life-
like representation of the gas-chandelier overhead.
No. 343. Portrait of John Aird, Etq., by LUKB FILDES, R.A.
So magnificent a beard ought to have been treated by HUBERT
HAIR-COMBER, R.A. 'Tis a masterly portrait. The only fault is
that instead of being full lengtn it is Kit-Cat. Now, all

that, on this occasion, they rant see enough of him. But, "bearded
like the Pard." 'tis admirable, so far aa it goes.
No. 346. Charming girl's portrait, by O. H. BOUGHTON, E.A.
But oughtn't the drill instructor to have been called in to give
the word of command, "Eyes right"?
No. 403. Oh! How the ladies will all like this!!" Here's a
pretty baby boy!" "Such a sweet little pink of perfection-faced
cherub!" "0, the Ticksy Wicksy Wee! Pooty'itty sing! He
^1'ifll have a nice gold chain and a medal to play with, he shall,

the smiling cherub . . . .Why it's. . . . Heavens! .... "Sir
George Faudel Phillips, Bart.,~O.C.I.E" "May he live long and
brosber!"
No. 414. Portrait of Anderson Critchett. Esq., M.A. and
F.R.C.S., by FREDK. GOODALL, R.A. Capital likeness of
"Handy Andy," the Oculist, who deserves to be treated by a
Master of 'Eye Art. Hope the portrait's health will improve
during the season, but, it looks very delicate.
No. 445. By PETER GRAHAM, R.A. (" Rear Admiral"). This
ancient mariner is never more at home than when he's at sea!
Teo ho. my lads, tack a bit, and steer round to
No. 448. By JOHN BRETT, A., another sea-piece. Here are
two "variationsin C"; No. 445 is C major, and No. 448 C. minor.
No. 458. Picture by MARY GROVES. Three children about to
sing to an organ accompaniment. We should have called it" A
Threatening Squall." Tell that to the marine-painters.
No. 603. Marvellous painting is this "portrait of a shentle-
man," by JOHN S. SARGENT, R.A. This "Sargent" of the R.A.,
who has done so much to raise himself from the ranks, most
assuredly deserves a "commission"; and that he has plenty of
such "commissions " as he desires and deserves, is evidenced by
what he exhibits in this year's show. Look at this No. 603. Mr.
MASHER WERTHEIMER and his poodle; the master with his tongue
in his cheek, the faithful quadruped with his tongue out. "Sly
dogs both." The master has evidently just concluded a first-rate
bargain, and the " little dog laughs to see such fun!" MASHER
ARTHEIMER himself is a veritable nhjet d'art.
No. 609. How superlatively disdainful of No. 603 appears " The
Chairman of the P. & 0. Steam Navigation Company," as, with
tip-tilted nose, he tries to walk out of his frame in order to inform
the admiring spectators that, though he and No. 603 own the same
art-parent in Colour-SAROKNT, R.A., yet that he. Sir THOMAS,
has no connection with the gentleman at No. 603, although, here,
they are in the same line. Bravissimo!
No. 628. Mr. GEO. S. WATSON shows us a reverend gentleman
who has fallen fast asleep in his chair while preparing his sermon,
thus probably anticipating the effect of his own preaching on to-
morrow's congregation. In the next room, only separated from
him by a strip of canvas, is
No. 623. M. CARL BREITENSTEIN, struggling with a violin-
cello, and evidently saying to himself. "I'm an 'aggrieved
parishioner!' I'll wake him UT>!" T. BLAKE WEIOMAN.
No. 626. Advice. If you find the place becoming too warm and
"stuffy," just go and spend a quiet five minutes in front of this
picture by Mr. JOSEPH FARQTJIIARSON. He calls it " The Weary
Watte of StKitvs" but there's no waste here. Happy the purchaser
who can buy these " nives " for anything like "Nix."
No. 909. And here's another, by THOMAS SOMERSCALES. Not
snow, but sea. There's a warning breeze, and the xky is be-
coming overclouded! Get away as quickly as you can, and take
this picture with you. Unhook it, and hook it.
No. 645. Miss HELEN CRIDLAND very cleverly depicts
"Distraction in Church." During solemn fervice a naughty boy
has caught sight of a beetle (not shown in picture), which he
is evidently longing to pick up and throw at two small children
who have also seen it, and are dreadfully frightened.

Nos. 1967, 1963, 1965, and 1961, respectively sculptured by
ANDREA C. LUCHESI, WILLIAM R. COITON, THOMAS BHOCK,

Nor is her attention to be distracted from her work by the quite
uncallod-for blandishments bestowed on her by quite an outsider,
who is a dark-green gentleman "mid noddings on" (No. 1694,
F. W. POMEBOY), who, holding up a cocoa-nut by its hair, is
saying, " See what I 've won at three shies a penny! Come and
have a bit!" The third party in the quadrille, No. 1965, is so
ashamed of her p:sition that she casts down her eyes demurely,
and refuses to notice the signs made to her by the other lady,
No. 1961, who is waving a torch. Had these four appeared at a
Covent Garden ball, they would have been ejected by the police.
No. 1895. "Rathfr Out of It." A statuette, very perfectly
executed, of Field-Marshal Viscount WOLSELEY, K.P. (" Kor-

No. 1962. F.-M. Lord Roberto (HARRY BATES, A.), who, though

Further back I traced a like

(from Our Oicn Commissioner with the Winning
Side.)
THE Captain stood upon the ship
And rolled his eagle eye;
Seaward he gazed, then boldly raised
His phonoblast on high;
"My tars !" he said, "the time has come
For us to do or die!
"This naval war has been in hand
Some half-an-hour or more,
And the patriot Press by now, I guess,
Blasphemes along the shore,
Waiting for us to paint the deep
Pink with the foeman's gore.
"They want their copy within the hour,
And a good half-hour has gone;
And a private ark is the only mark
Our guns have been trained upon;
A ten-cent tab that wasn't aware
That a war was going on.
"Now the Nation's Press is a whole-souled
crew,
And it don't like fooling around;
And I 'm blamed if I know (to an ocean
or so)
Where the enemy's fleet is bound;
But, top-side up or the other way on,
"Shin up, shin up the various ropes
And look with all your might;
And let me hear if things appear
To be likely to loom in sight."
He casised and worked his weather orb,
Closing the other tight.
Scarce had the cook got lashed aloft
When he mide a useful find:—
"Oho!" said he, "what's this I see
Right aft? "—that is, behind—
"I calculate it's a man-o'-war,
Or something of the kind."
The skipper raked the spot and spoke :—
"I reckon that that is so;
And don't you make no darned mistake,
We boss this little show;
So bank the fires eternal high
And let her fairly go."
A shout ensued: the stokers heard,
And they came up fizzling Lot:
Each mother's son embraced a gun
And begged to have a shot;
To teach the foe a thing or two,
And also what was what.
Nearing, they spied a friendlv flag,
But they never eased nor checked;
"May I be dead," the Captain said,

So get your range on the starboard port"

HONOURED SIR,—I think that You and
my other Esteemed Patrons may assuredly
mark Wednesday, April 27 as a Real Prim-
rose Day, when my Straight-out Selection,
Ditratli, romped in for the Guineas at
Newmarket. It was ordained that Mr.
Punch, and his humble satellite, D. J.,
should be the ONLY foretellers of the
victory of Mr. WALLACE JOHNSTONE'S bay
colt at the remunerative odds of 100 to 12.
In all modesty I can only repeat the ancient
Roman adage, Palmam qui meruit ferat,
which, you being a Public School and
University Scholar, I need not translate
for the edification of those only acquainted
with the Vulgar Tongue. As usual, the
customary acknowledgments of my Pre-
science are not to hand. The Diamond
Rinffs, the Cases of Champagne, the Boxes
of choice Cigars, and, above all, the Cheer-
ful Cheques, which we welcome in our
progress over the Hunting Country of Life,
are all wanting. But, like the Flying
Dutchman (the Mariner, not the Quad-
ruped), I still intend to circumnavigate (if
that be the correct definition) the Cape of
Good Hope. It is true that I have received
several communications respecting our
Joint Success—this reads like a Culinary
Triumph—but they mostly run as per fol-
lowing sample:—

winner of the Two Thousand Guineas, we should
be glad if you would settle at your earliest conve-
nience our bill against you of £23 14s. 2rf., other-

[According to the Daily Mail, "the hiitreil for Spaniards has grown so
intense among the patriotic farmers of Westchester County, New York State,
that they have begun killing all the Spanish fowls which they own. Colonel
(JKEEN, of the Portchrster Infantry, says he has killed six Spanish roosters
which he owned, and that his neighbours are following his example."]
HERE 's three times three for Colonel GREEN
And Westchester farmers all 1
The bravest patriots ever seen
To answer duty's call!
They might not meet the Spanish fleet
On the high seas cheek by jowl,
So with bowie and knife they began their strife,
And slaughtered the Spanish fowl!
They avenged the Maine on the farmyard don
Who dared in their ears to crow,
And his wives and chicks were set upon
With many a deadly blow!
E'en the hapless egg could no quarter beg
As it crunched 'neath the stalwart heel,
And the chick unborn must have known the scorn
That all honest patriots feel!
Here 's three times three for Colonel GREEN
And that rooster-slaying band,
Who showed the foe what men may mean
When threatened their native land!
And the Eagle's cry well nigh bust the sky
As he soared o'er the foreign crew,
And in proud Madrid men their faces hid
When they learned what Revenge could do!

CARAN D'ACHE is an artist of all work in black and white. We
have not yet seen him in colour. His favourite subject appears to
have been the Great NAPOLEON ; specially his cocked hat and long
coat. CAKAN D'ACHE is very fond of "going Nap," which is more
than any spectator will do when seated in front of his caricatures,
all distinctly French, and the majority of them not to be easily
"understanded of the people "here though they will be gene-
rally appreciated. Some are irresistibly funny; as, for example,
the drunken elephant. The animal tells his own tale—a perform-
ance auite urique. His exhibition is at 148, New Bond Street,
placed by the artist himself, pictorially, under the special
patronage of Mr. Punch. As CAKAN D'ACHE he is hard to beat;
as "Monsieur POIHE" he cannot be "pair'd" or coupled with
anyone. He is unique.
FLITTEMGS.
Pretoria,, April 3.
DEAB MB. PUNCH,—If you want to enjoy a quiet Sunday,
don't come here at the time of one of the quarterly Boer
nachtmaalt, or religious festivals. I nit in a room of the Grand
Hotel, with ita stoep overlooking the Church Square. All round
the Church, and right up to the Government Buildings, some
hundreds of burghers have trekked in from all parts of the
country with their twelve-span ox-waggons, till the place
resembles a mixture of a gipsy encampment and a farmyard.
The square, I believe, is public property, so four times a year the
worthy doppers come to town and thus assert their right of owner-
ship. They outspan their cattle, and boil their black pots at the very
steps of the Legislature ; and not even nlle mathtig OOM PAUL can
say them nay. Still, in the day-time, it is a sight most distinctly
worth seeing.
It is now late at night, but a vigorous chorus is going on,
composed chiefly of Boer families chanting most dreary tunes,
fortissimo and lentisiimo, Transvaal babies and dogs trying to out-
yell each other, cows lowing, and Kaffirs chattering, until one
feels inclined to address them in forcible double-Dutch. Unfortu-
nately, I cannot think of any more emphatic epithet than
hrxdelbereddfraar, which I am told means merely bailiff.
The S. A. H. railway authorities cannot be said exactly to
welcome the harmless Uitlanders on their arrival from the South
at a desolate frontier station called Yereeniging. They are
shunted about for five hours between midnight and dawn, and at
5.30 A.M. all their belongings are turned out on the platform to
be minutely overhauled. They are then severally massaged and
pommelled all over in the Douane, to see if thev conceal any
Maxim-guns or Mauser-rifles about their person. In spite, how-
ever, of all these precautions against any repetition of the Raid, I
know of a lady who smuggled a revolver through, wrapped up in
a kid-glove, which was actually handled by the unsuspecting
Customs-officer as he investigated her dressing-bag.
I have shot OOM PAUL (with a camera) as he was leavirg
Government Buildings. Unfortunately the usual small boy con-
trived to thrust himself into the foreground at the critical moment,
so there is another good caricature gone wrong. I am just about
to have an audience of the President in his wayside shanty, and
hope the old man will not order his " Zarps" to take me out to
immediate execution for lete-majiste, or high way-snapshooting.
However, Pretoria is an excellent place to spend a few minutes
at In spite of all the depression, it seems to be going ahead, and
they are running up some fine public buildings, especially the
New Law Courts, where Justice (according to Boer ideas) will
take up her abode till the last Outlander has been put in " tronk,"
and Boerdom will reign supreme. Then the Latter Lammas
Sittings will be held, and KOTZK will cease from troubling, and
the Millenium will be here. Till then, an Englishman can feel
at home in the Residency.

A FOUL impenetrable cloud
The blessed light of heaven shuts
From your sad visage, like a shroud—

Each arabesque and traceried niche
Its all-pervading soot-flakes choke,

For mutton chops.
We yearn and pine for purer air,

Whose form and colour should be fair—
Whose marble white.

Dejectedly we sit and munch;
For, though of course we doat on Art—

AN APPEAL TO ALMS.—London is the
richest city in the world, and yet the London
Hospital is in a very poor way. During
the last two years there has been a deficit
of .£30,000 in the necessary income, and
now a large capital expenditure has be-
come imperative. The domestic arrange-
electric lighting is a requisite that cannot
be afforded. There is no photographic
department, although the Bontgen-ray
work is of the last importance. Then,
what can be done? Why, the philan-
thropists inust wake up and walk up.

Something pathetic about war-worn figure
of CAF'EN TOMMY BOWLES as he begged
permission just now to intervene "for
moment" in debate on second reading of
Evidence in Criminal Cases Bill. It was a
lawyers' night. You might almost hear
the rustle of their gowns. The accessories
of the scene lent themselves with singular
effect to the illusion that we were in the
Criminal Court. SPEAKER, in wig and
gown, canopied in chair, looked the learned
Judge to life. At the table below were the
clerks, also wigged and gowned. There

Spanish Poultry. "GuEMfi I'LL KILL THOSE FOWLS,
ANYWAY!"
[According to the Daily Mail, "the hatred for Spaniards has grown so
intense among the patriotic farmers of Wostrhester County, New York State,
that they have begun killing all the Spunish fowls which they own. Colonel
(iiiKEN, of the 1'ortchester Infantry, nays he has killed six Spanish roosfcrs
which he owned, and that his neighbours are following his example."]
HERE'S three times three for Colonel GREEN
And Westchester farmers all I
The bravest patriots ever seen
To answer duty's call!
They might not meet the Spanish fleet
On the In^h seis cheek by jowl,
So with bawie and knife they began their strife,
And slaughtered the Spanish fowl!
They avenged the Maine on the farmyard don
Who dared in their ears to crow,
And his wives and chicks were set upon
With many a deadly blow!
E'en the hapless egg could no quarter beg
As it crunched 'neath the stalwart heel.
And the chick unborn must have known the scorn
That all hoaest patriots feel!
Here's three times three for Colonel GREEN
And that rooster-slaying band,
Who showed the foe what men may mean
When threatened their native land!
And the Eagle's cry well nigh bust the sky
As he soared o'er the foreign crew,
And in proud Madrid men their faces hid
When they learned what Ravenge could do!
CYCLING CONUNDRUM.
Q. What article of the cyclist girl's attire do a couple of care-
less barbers recall to mind?
BEAUX AETS.
"CARAN D'ACHB" is the pseudonym assumed by M. EMMANUEL
POIRE, just as HABLOT K. BROWNE was known as "PHIZ."
The name is easier to d'ash off in speaking than is PoiRfi; for
'D'ACHE," were it only pronounced "Dash" (which it isn't),
would exactly describe the artist's method, or at least that phase of
it about which there is so much dash and "go." But " D'AcHE"
is pronounced " darsh" (with a very liquid "r"), which upsets the
simple and unpretentious English-speaking jokelet. What's in a
name? Something. And here is something more than a name.
CARAN D'ACDE is an artist of all work in black and white. We
have not yet seen him in colour. His favourite subject appears to
have been the Great NAPOLEON ; specially his cocked hat and long
coat. CARAN D'ACHE is very fond of "going Nap," which is more
than any spectator will do when seated in front of his caricatures,
all distinctly French, and the majority of them not to be easily
"understanded of the people "here though they will be gene-
rally appreciated. Some are irresistibly funny; as, for example,
the drunken elephant. The animal tells his own tale—a perform-
ance auite urique. His exhibition is at 148, New Bond Street,
placed by the artist himself, pictorially, under the special
patronage of Mr. Punch. As CARAN D'ACHE he is hard to oeat;
as "Monsieur POIRE" he cannot be "/xit'r'd," or coupled with
anyone. He is unique.
FLITTINGS.
Pretoria, April 3.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—If you want to enjoy a quiet Sunday,
don't come here at the time of one of the quarterly Boer
nachtmaals, or religious festivals. I nit in a room of the Grand
Hotel, with its stoep overlooking the Church Square. All round
fhe Church, and right up to the Government Buildings, some
hundreds of burghers have trekked in from all parts of the
country with their twelve-span ox-waggons, till the place
resembles a mixture of a gipsy encampment and a farmyard.
The square, I believe, is public property, so four times a year the
worthy doppers come to town and thus assert their right of owner-
ship. They outspan their cattle, and boil their black pots at the very
steps of the Legislature ; and not oven allr. machtig OOM PAUL can
say them nay. Still, in the day-time, it is a sight most distinctly
worth seeing.
It is now late at night, but a vigorous chorus is going on,
composed chiefly of Boer families chanting most clreary tunes,
fortissimn and lentissinw, Transvaal babies and dogs trying to out-
yell each other, cows lowing, and Kaffirs chattering, until one
feels inclined to address them in forcible double-Dutch. Unfortu-
nately, I cannot think of any more emphatic epithet than
botdelberedderaar, which I am told means merely bailiff.
The S. A. K. railway authorities cannot be said exactly to
welcome the harmless Uitlanders on their arrival from the South
at a desolate frontier station called Vereeniging. They are
shunted about for five hours between midnight and dawn, and at
o.30 A.M. all their belongings are turned out on the platform to
be minutely overhauled. They are then severally massaged and
pommelled all over in the Douane, to see if thev conceal any
Maxim-guns or Mauser-rifles about their person. In spite, how-
ever, of all these precautions against any repetition of the Raid, I
know of a lady who smuggled a revolver through, wrapped up in
a kid-glove, which was actually handled by the unsuspecting
Customs-officer as he investigated her dressing-bag.
I have shot OOM PAUL (with a camera) as he was leavirg
Government Buildings. Unfortunately the usual small boy con-
trived to thrust himself into the foreground at the critical moment,
so there is another good caricature gone wrong. I am just about
to have an audience of the President in his wayside shanty, and
hope the old man will not order his " Zarps" to take me out to
immediate execution for lese-majtste, or highway-snapshooting.
However, Pretoria is an excellent place to spend a few minutes
at. In spite of all the depression, it seems to be going ahead, and
they are running up some fine public buildings, especially the
New Law Courts, where Justice (according to Boer ideas) will
take up her abode till the last Outlander has been put in " tronk,"
and Boerdom will reign supreme. Then the 1 -utter Lammas
Sittings will be held, and KOTZE will cease from troubling, and
the Millenium will be here. Till then, an Englishman can feel
at home in the Residency.
-I. A pair of nickere.
Yours patriotically, Z. Y. X.

A FOUL impenetrable cloud
The blessed light of heaven shuts
From your sad visage, like a shroud—
Our Lady of the Smuts;
Each arabesque and traceried niche
Its all-pervading soot-flakes choke,
Daubed to a blackness as of pitch
From lurid smoke.

To fall around in grimy drops,

Dejectedly we sit and munch;

AN APPEAL TO ALMS.—London is the
richest city in the world, and yet the London
Hospital is in a very poor way. During
the last two years there has been a deficit
of £30,000 in the necessary income, and
now a large capital expenditure has be-
come imperative. The domestic arrange-
electric lighting is a requisite that cannot
be afforded. There is no photographic
department, although the Bontgen-ray
work is of the last importance. Then,
what can be done? Why, the philan-
thropists niii-i wake up and walk up.
Legacies are valuable, but bis dnt q>ti cito

Houte of Commons, Monday, April 25.—
Something pathetic about war-worn figure
of CAP'EN TOMMY BOWLES as he begged
permission just now to intervene "for
moment" in debate on second reading of
Evidence in Criminal Cases Bill. It was a
lawyers' night. You might almost hear
the rustle of their gowns. The accessories
of the scene lent themselves with singular
effect to the illusion that we were in the
Criminal Court. SPEAKER, in wig and
gown, canopied in chair, looked the learned
Judge to life. At the table below were the
clerks, also wigged and gowned. There
was the gallery of spectators facing his
lordship; on either side the jury-box rising

"I "m afraid," he said, with that mixed
metaphor that bewrays the landsman,
"that my hon. friend is getting beyond my
depth."
The ocean of universal knowledge has no
depths the CAP'EN cannot plumb. Diving
into the debate, on the sea of which bobbed
the wigs of luminaries of the Bar, the
old salt serenely disported himself, showing
them all how to do it.
BurinfM done.—Evidence in Criminal
Cases Bill read a second time by 229 votes
against SO.
*Tve*day. — "Lest we forget, Lest we
forget!" 'Twas BASHMEAD-ARTLETT mur-
muring his Recessional in the unwilling
ear of PRIHCE ARTHUR. MACLEAN—whose
perennial air of having just comfortably
dined struck l)r. AMBROSE the other night,
and suggested to him a phrase the SPEAKER
promptly called on him to withdraw—been
wanting to know what the MARKISS said
when China hinted that she would do any-
thing in despite of Russia if assured of
British protection? PRINCE ARTHUR made
haste to disclaim any intention of gua-
ranteeing Chinese territory. This was
BA8HMEAD-ABTLETT's opportunity, and he
seized it by the hair. Been rather quiet of
late; said to be suffering remorse for having
worried GEOROE CTJRZON into a sick room.
This opening to his old haunts irresistible.
"I wish," he said, "to ask the right
honourable gentleman if he has forgotten
the resolution of the House of Commons in
which it was declared"
SPEAKER down on him like hawk on
hapless sparrow. "Do I understand, Mr.
SPEAKER," twittered the sparrow, "that
you rule my question out of order."
"Certainly," answered the hooded hawk,
"it is not a request for information, but a
speech."
Life in the House of Commons, as
BASHMEAD sadly remarked in the sympa-
thetic ear of Mr. PATRICK O'BRIEN, would
be tolerable only for the SPEAKER.
"Do I forget, dear TOBY;-" PRINCE
ARTHUR bitterly said, when, at twenty
minutes to eleven p.m., questions being
comfortably over, House began business of
the sitting, "I think not. As you are
good enough to say, considering the fierce
light that beats about my seat in the House
of Commons I get along pretty well. But
if you ask me how I came to adopt on
behalf of the Government the Sheffield
knight's resolution affirming the sanctity
of Chinese territory, which at the moment
Russia and Germany were carving up, I
frankly tell you I don't know. When the
lady asked Dr. JOHNSON why in his dic-
tionary he had mixed up the fetlock and
the pastern of the horse, he answered
shortly, 'Ignorance, Madame, sheer igno-
rance.' If you ask me why we walked into
BASIIMEAD - ART-LETT'S clumsy trap, 1
answer, 'Temporary aberration of the
tired intellect, dear TOBY. Pure idiocy.""
ThurtJay.—The supernatural quietude
that suffuses Committee on Local Govern-
ment Bill threatened just now with lupture.
Proposal made that County Council may
appoint visiting Committee to prisons.
JOHNSTON OF BALLYKLLBEG moved to
insert proviso that no men who had
themselves been ia gaol should be ap-
As far as personnel of House of Commons
is concerned, this not such sweeping pro-
posal as it would have proved fifteen years
ago. At that epoch an Irish Member who
had not been in prison was rare as snakes
in Iceland. For one to make a speech in
Parliamentary debate without incident illy
alluding to something that happened (or
didn't happen) " when I was in prison," was
the exception. Different now; only small
proportion of present race bear that mark
of high distinction. Still, there are some
who proudly claim it, as there are families
who boast direct descent from the comrades
of the Conqueror. On behalf of these
JOHN DILLON protested, startling Com-
mittee with mention of alleged fact that
BALLYKILBEG himself was of the elect.
This news to most. Everyone asking what
he was "in for." SARK says he believes it
was forspeaking disrespect fullycf the POPE.
Bunntss done.— Getting on nicely with
the Local Government Bui.
Friday.—The MARKISS on his way home
from the Riviera, bringing his sheaves with
him in the shape of betttr health. Every-
one glad to hear this. We 're all proud of
our MARKISS, in spite of the Legend of
Talienwan and eome otherc. In the com-
parative leisure of life in the sunny South
the MARKISS has been sauntering along
some of t he untrodden way s of SH AKSPEARE.
Much struck by passage he came upon in

Squire Mayfly (just arrived at his pet piece of water). "An, GLORIOUS
TIME o' YEAR! MOST INSPIRITING! EVERYTHING BURSTING INTO
RENEWED LIFE! OUCJHT TO HAVE A THUNDERING GOOD KlLL TO-DAY!"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Concerning habelk Carnaby (HoDDER AND STOT7GHTON) is the
most brilliant book my Baronite has read this year. Miss ELLEN
THORNEYCROFT FOWLER has made her curtsey to the public
before as a writer of dainty verse. This is her first novel. It
may safely be predicted that, if success has its usual influence as
an incentive, it will not be her last. It is probable pro-
founder study and practice may add something to the weight of
the (.ramatis persona, and to the movement of the plot. In her
first book Miss FOWLER has been content to present the very
ordinary people whom we meet every day in Society, living their
more or less undistinguished lives. Such as they are, they are
faithfully reproduced. That she has capacity for probing pro-
founder depths is shown in the exquisitely-written chapter where
the A'M-. Mark Beaton is financially ruined, and friends and neigh-
bours with delicate movement come to his help. Martha, the old
handmaiden, not only declines to accept the month's notice given
by her mis ress, and insists on staying on without wages, but on
the plea of being relieved from "covetousnesa and the love of
money creeping upon me in my old age," induces her simple-
hearted master to take charge of her savings. Miss FOWLER'S
d'alogue sparkles upon every page with the form and polish of
comedy. When authors win established positions, some ill-
advised friend bores the public with collecting their good things,
and presenting them in disjointed form in a three-and-sixpenny
volume. Any one so disposed would find sufficient material in
Miss FOWLER'S first essay. The charm of the book is added to
by the little verse which precedes each chapter. One is short
enough and good enough to quote as illustrating Miss FOWLER'S
shre Nil humour and her dexterous turn of phrases.
A woman's tongue is ever slow
To tell the thing she does not know.
That Queen BESS must have been a dangerously fascinating
person is evident from the true histories of her Majesty derived
from unquestionably authentic sources; that she was a marvellous
beauty it is impossible to conceive, judging, that is, from her
portraits, one of which, namely that by ZUCCHKHO in Hampton
Court Palace, forms the frontispiece of Mr. MARTIN A. S. HUME'S
most interesting and amusing book on Tne Courtships of Qteen
E'izabtth (T. FISHES UNWIN), compiled from papers in the
Public Eecord Office. ELIZABETH was, indeed, "fancy free,"
but her time of "maiden meditation" must have been uncom-
monly short, seeing that as the youthful Lady ELIZABETH she
indulged in such "romping"—to put it very mildly—as would
have been considered indelicate even in those days of stiff costumes
and of curiously free and easy manners when the costumes were off.
Queen BKSS w as a consummate mistress of diplomacy, preferring
in any and every case, whether political or social, to be mistress
par exceUtnct, in every sense of the word. Lucky the men who
escaped her fascinations! That she never really intended to marry
is, of course, a certainty, for she was a veritable Don Qiuvanni in
petticoats. Miss BETSY TUDOR, "leading lady" of the British
Historical Drama, was a thorough ar title, and she so stage-
managed effects, and play-acted so admirably, as to be an immense
favourite with her subjects in the pit and gallery. A tyrant is
sure to be popular if only the tyranny be exercised on the right
class. The imperial and imperious ELIZABETH, this strong-
minded, vain, epicene queen, with her wonderful red hair and her
"incurably diseased leg," incapable of true love, but yielding to
every sudden fit of amorous passion, who lived only to be courted,
flattered, fooled to the top of her bent (she herself regulating the
fooling), and who, afcer condescending on occasion, like the
blameless Miss Sully Brass, to be treated as " a good fellow, and
a jolly dog, and so forth" by such Dick Swivellerian companions
as were under her royal thumb, would suddenly turn like a
raging wild beast on the lovers whose familiarities she had per-
mitted and encouraged. Woe to any younger woman who should
dare to cross her path! Her masterful diplomacy, inspired and
carried out by CECIL and LEICESTER, as is well shown by Mr.
HUME, went far towards establishing the future greatness of
England. The fortune of this country was made by a successful
Bet on the throne. THE BARON DE B.-W.

A LITTLE Song of Somebody I
I sing in the early Spring,
'Mid a mist of whiskey-toddy,
With the faint green on the ling,
That stretches for miles and miles
With a fir-tree here and there,
The sort of spot rn the British Isles
That makes a Southron swear!
A little Song of Somebody,
Astral, yet worldJy wise,
For she sprang from a sea of shoddy,
With her wondrous amber eyes.
From a sea of shoddy she sprang,
To arise by a Scottish loch,
And with her began the Sturm anil Drang
That we do not greet with "Hoch!"
A little Song of Somebody!
Why was sne ever born
To drive us to whiskey-toddy,
And give us the husk for corn P
Why did she smile the smile
That fettered oar reason then P
Why did she try all Vivien's guile
In King of Rowan's Glen?
A little Song of Somebody
And over the whiskey-toddy
Wo agreed She meant and did
In this brutal Northern air
Thut makes the blood run cold.
I allow she was passing fair,
We foolish and none too bold!
A little Song of Somebody
That in this budding time
Brings that Lancashire girl and shoddy
Into metre, into rhyme.
There were four of us Musketeers
Who swore to be leal and true,
But three have traversed the Sands ot
Years,
And I pilgrim alone and renew
My vows with the bitterest rue
To you, Sweet Somebody, only you!
Why were you false, and oh! so cru

You drove me to Mountain Dew!
HINTS FOB BIKING BEGINNERS.
1. Insure your life and limbs. The
former will benefit your relations, the
latter yourself.
2. Learn on a hired machine. The beet
plan is to borrow a machine from a friend.
It saves hiring. Should the tyre be-
come punctured, the break be broken, the
the bell cracked, the lamp missing, and the
gear out of gear, you will return it as soon
as possible, advising your friend to provide
3. Practice on some soft and smooth
ground. For example, on a lawn; the
one next door for choice. A muddy road,
although sufficiently soft, is not recom-
mended—the drawbacks are obvious.
4. Choose a secluded place for practising.
It may at first sight appear somewhat selfish
to deprive your neighbours of a gratuitous
performance which would be certain to
amuse them. Nevertheless, be firm.
5. Get someone to hold you on. Engage
a friend in an interesting conversation

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW GALLERY.

No. 171. The Ghost's H'Aunt.
ON entering the North Room and
turning to the right, the visitor will
be struck by—
No. 262. A prophetic pictorial illus-
tration of an imaginary case. Here you
may see Mr. ARTHUR BALPOUR and Mr.
JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN brought up before
a magistrate, charged, after an all-nights
sitting, with having infringed the licensing
laws, by selling various intoxicating liquors
at the bar of the House. ARTHUR looks
anxious, and is evidently in a most painful
position in consequence of a table having
been thrust between his legs; While his
companion, with an orchid, a little the
worse for wear, in his button-hole, has
assumed an air of supreme indifference to
results, and evidently wishes it to be under-
stood that there exists no sort of collusion
between himself and his companion in the
dock. It is a pathetic picture, on which
Mr. SYDNEY P. HALL is to be congratu-
lated, and which may be hereafter remem-
bered as "the. Hall in the New Gallery."
Now proceed at once to—
No. 207. Do not consult your catalogue,
the artist's name is on the picture, "AR-
THUR MELVILLE." If this be a portrait,
how pleased with the work must be the
sitter, whoever she may be, at being thus
immortalised! She is quite the Queen of
the May-day, a Queen "of Shreds and
Patches.'" It is "Rag Fair" idealised.
Every visitor to the gallery owes a debt
of gratitude to Mr. MELVILLE for giving
them this "thing of beauty" which, as
will be seen by reference to No. 207 illus-
tration on this page, our talented artist
has genuinely appreciated.
No. 209. The surplus of the rags from
No. 207 have been collected in a waste-
paper basket, and are now being emptied
into a running stream. Notice the scraps
in the foreground—we should gay, in the
forewater. There ought to be a notice up,
"Rubbish must not be shot here," i.e., just
at this point, as the infringement of the
rule mars the effect of an otherwise charm-
ine landscape by ANDERSON HAGUE.
No. 221. "An Anrious Moment." Gen-
tleman having sat for a full-length portrait,
HIGH LIOH s BELOW STAIRS!
No. 207. "There, I told yer wot it 'ud be, Mr.
MELVILLE, there 's a ring at the front door bell—
it'» missus come 'ome and caught me settin' for ver
in 'er noo Velassky gownd, and a nice mess I ve
made on it!" By ARTHUR MELVILLB.
will be sufficient to include the pourtrayal
of his legs. He is searching his last
pocket, when in a burst of generosity the
artist, Mr. FREE LANCE CALKIN, decides to
"throw in his legs anyhow." And has
done so.
No. 223. Lady who can put up with
anything from her husband except a paltry
excuse. "So! You wish me to believe
that, do you?" she is saying. The ex-
pression is wonderfully conveyed, and sin-
cere congratulations must be tendered to
the great Colour-SAROENT, R.A., who, as
is evident from his excellent work wherever
it may be seen, is not a man given to
flattery.
"SAKOENT won't flatter you, no, not a wee bit.
ifagna eft veritai et pr&raleiit!"
An Foetiea.
No. 236. "Pig-turesque." W. H. Y.
TlTCOMBE.
No. 241. Delightful picture by Miss
MAY L. Gow. Gow on and prosper!
Lovely mother and child both doing well,
and done well, too. Only—child's left eye
won't let its right eye know in what direc-
tion it is looking.
No. 200. Another delightful portrait by
the Colour-SARGENT, R.A., showing how a
lad>, like Mariana in the moated grange,
has become "a-weary, a-weary," while sit-
ting to him for her portrait. She is an-
noyed with him, and is surreptitiously
sliding off her chair. He should have
called this sitter "An Early Riser."
No. 192. Lady playing"" this little pig
went to market " with fingers of left hand.
Cleverly "taken in the act" by BYAM
SHAW.

No. 215. The Berthe-day Clayes-figure.

us how a knight in armour comforted
his lady love when she had a toothache.
"Never mind, dear," he is saying,
"we'll send for MARIANNE; she'll paint

This one by Mr. GEO, BOUGHTON, R.A.
But Mr. G. B.'s good lady has no one to
comfort her. She is a dame settle. These
two should be in Mr. TOOTH'S exhibition.
No. 135. Clever painting this,—very.
But, I beg your pardon, whom did you say
it was meant to represent ?" Mrs. Patrick
Campbell," says the artist, E. Halle\ No 1
Go along with you,Mr. Halle1! H'allez done!
Perhaps it was meant to be Hallegorical.
No. 57. This picture would be invalu-
able to any advertiser of medicinal remedies
for all sorts of afflictions. You Ve only
to put the name of the pills, or whatever
it may be, on the banner borne by the
central figure, and there you are. No
charge made to Mr. WALTER CRANE for this
inspired suggestion for " The World's Con-
querors."
No. 14. "A Trying Moment." The
new song. Here is admirable Madame
EAMES, admirably depicted, whom every
opera-goer and concert-frequenter will at
once recognise. She is, like a good child,
"seen, but not heard," while practising a
song to the rather hesitating accompani-
ment, on a harpsichord, played by a
foreign cavalier, probably that eminent
composer, Count FORINABAR. It is a story
(a JULIAN STORY) with the moral, "Prac-
tice makes perfect." A "Story without
words," which tells its own tale.
No. 129. "No more coughs, colds, or
sneezings. Try our new waterproof cape!"
Traveller for above-mentioned invention is
touring in the lake country, and saying
cheerfully, "Me, rniri! Here I am with
my nice clean collar and wristbands, pot-
hat in hand, and no mmbrrlla! I "ra a verv
dry subject for any artist, but here I will

ture, as the more haste the less Speed

"success," and those who don't can sub-
stitute the opposite. It represents a ftirl

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—We know that the
high and mighty Authorities privileged to
tax the down-trodden ratepayers are about
to construct at enormous expense a new
viaduct over the Thames in place of the
present Alpine structure known as Kew
Bridge. Permit me, as a constant riverain
observer, to draw attention to the fact that
this scheme is sheer waste of money, for
at low water the volume of the stream is
simply nil; a child could walk across the ill-
concealed bed. Some twenty cartloads of
gravel and a ton or so of freestone would
make an excellent and convenient cause-
way of communication between Middlesex
and Surrey. Indeed, were instructions
given to the several water companies to
pump a few more million gallons out of
the river, there would be no necessity for
either gravel or stone. Trusting that my
suggestion may meet, through your es-
teemed agency, the Official Eye,
I am, Yours obediently,
AN ECONOMIST.

Two nights ago, to the accompaniment
of ringing cheers, I dived into the deep off
the blockading squadron. I was alone.
I had asked for volunteers to swim with
me to Cuba, but the response had lacked
enthusiasm.
It was my design to be the first to con-
vey to the insurgents a report of the
sack of the Philippines.
Shrouded in murky darkness I came in
under the guns of Matanzas, deeming my-
self fortunate to escape with the loss of
in v breath. Pushing on fearlessly into the
interior, through the ruins of a blasted
tobacco-grove, melancholy handiwork of
Iberian despots, I reached the camp of

allowed me not to linger—was strangely
striking. The military band, covered
with parti-coloured bunting and Rem-
brandtesque in the chiaroscuro of the
zurka. Against the background of a tool-
shed shone out the gleaming muslin dress
of a Cuban girl, more handsome than your
readers would readily believe. Leaping
from her coign of vantage on a pile of
packing-cases, she drew towards me, the
tears of joy still hot upon her cheeks, her
bosom heaving with intolerable emotion.
As she raised her sombrero—in the pic-
turesque manner of the country—her
raven tresses fell about her shapely feet.
Then, laying aside her maidenly reserve,
she flung her arms in one passionate coil
about my neck; and in a voice that rang
out above the leading bassoon, a wild note
of longing mingled with its triumph, she
shouted, "Ffro Cuba Libre" (which was
indifferent grammar) full in my trembling
tympanum. A hundred rocks sent back
the shattering echo.
Reluctantly I tore myself from her
whelming embrace, and set my course
upon the path of duty. Ah! shall I ever
set eyes on that lithe and lissome form
again? Quitn sabf.f

been recognised by a thin red badge of
courage that I happened to be wearing in

with parti-coloured bunting and Rem-

zurka. Against the background of a tool-
shed shone out the gleaming muslin dress
of a Cuban girl, more handsome than your
readers would readily believe. Leaping
from her coign of vantage on a pile of
packing-cases, she drew towards me, the
tears of joy still hot upon her cheeks, her
bosom heaving with intolerable emotion.
As she raised her .sombrero—in the pic-
turesque manner of the country—her
raven tresses fell about her shapely feet.
Then, laying aside her maidenly reserve,
she flung her arms in one passionate coil
about my neck; and in a voice that rang
out above the leading bassoon, a wild note
of longing mingled with its triumph, she
shouted, "Vira C-uka Libre" (which was
indifferent grammar) full in my trembling
tympanum. A hundred rocks sent back
the shattering echo.
Reluctantly I tore myself from her
whelming embrace, and set my course
upon the path of duty. Ah! shall I ever

the sullen booming of their foiled attack.
Later, I was pursued by what proved to

been recognised by a thin red badge of
courage that I happened to be wearing in
my hat. I declined the courteous off or of
a lift.

clad in my summer night-gear (for beneath

Public Opinion. What was true of him-

of his recollection and belief he had

tising on him certain hypnotic arts, to
accept and produce a certain drama,
written by them in five acts, entitled
The Medicine Man. It is expected that
several other charges will be brought
against Messrs. TRAILL and HICHENS, nota-
bly by a certain Dr. Nikola, mesmerist
and hypnotist, and by Count Fosco, who
accuses them of having taken one of
his chief characteristics, namely, his love
for birds, and given it to Dr. Tregenna.
Messrs. TRAILL and HICHENS have not been
seen since the first night of the piece, and
up to the present moment have succeeded
in evading arrest. The following evidence,
however, was produced, fully justifying
the course taken in the present proceed-
ings : —
Sir HENRY IRVING, who appeared to be
suffering from considerable exhaustion,
said that he had known the defendants for
some time, and w»s on good terms with
them, as he hoped he was with every one.
(Applause in Court.) They had no repu-
tation as dramatists, and, on looking back
he could scarcely realise how he could
ever have been induced to act as he had
sat late at night some months ago, with
Messrs. TRAILL and HICHENS, discussing
the subject of—er—mesmerism generally,
and of what could be done with it if
properly treated—of course by Messrs.
TRAILL and HICHENS—in a drama at the
Lyceum, where, as Mathias, in a very
strong sort of hypnotic play called The
Bells, he had achieved a great and un-
doubted success. How long this discussion
lasted he was unable to say: nor could
he distinctly remember either his dropping
off to sleep or the departure of Messrs.
TRAILL and HICHENS. On awaking from
what he now felt morally convinced
had been a hypnotic trance (sensation in
Court)—yes, he would emphatically repeat,
a hypnotic trance (still greater sensation,
and several ladies carried out fainting)—
he found on the table before him a con-
tract signed by his own hand, in which
he undertook to produce this hypnotic
drama written by Messrs. TRAILL and
HICHENS. In consequence of such promise
the drama in question, after considerable
personal toil and trouble, the authors of
the work having had scarcely any practical
ments, had been produced. Ordinarily,
Sir HENRY continued, he considered him-
self, and was generally considered, as
"uncommonly wide awake," and hence his
acceptance and production of this—er—re-
markable drama,was only applicable to him-
self and his countless friends and supporters
among the public on the hypnotic hypothe-
sis. (Applause.) He had no hesitation in
saying that it seemed to him that, while
under the hypnotic influence of Messrs.
TRAILL and HICHENS, he had no conscious-
ness of exercising an absolutely free will in
the matter. "I believe," wearily added
Sir HENRY, who had given his evidence
with considerable reluctance, "that I did
tell the public in my first-night speech that
this piece would run till July. When I
said this I must still have been under the
hypnotic influence aforesaid."
Mr. BRAM STOKER, acting manager at
the Lyceum, on being called, said he was
the author of a mesmeric, hypnotical, dia-
bolic kind of romance, entitled Dracula,
and therefore knew all about hypnotism.
Hypnotism in a book was one thing; on
the stage quite another.
Mr. BEBRBOHM TREU said, "Friends,
Romans, countrymen 1" He begged par-
don; he thought he was Antony. Yes, he
had tried hypnotism at the Haymarket
Theatre. At that moment he could not
recall the name of the play or its author.
From his own experience, he should cer-
tainly be of opinion that his good friend
Sir HENRY, when accepting this play, must
have been under hypnotic influence. While
on the subiect, he might observe that there
was a kind of hypnotism in Jitliux Ccrsar
at Her Majesty's, and also a ghost, and
if Did you say I could stand down?
Oh! certainly.
Mr. Punch's Own Reporter said he had
never seen Miss ELLEN TERRY appear to
ereater advantage. She was wonderful!
He emphatically said "appear," because
there was very little to do that was worth
doing, and little to sav worth the saying:
but whatever it was, Miss TERRY did it and
said it inimitablv. Sir HENRY was ad-
mirable as Dr. Trearnna. Mr. MACKIN-
TOSH was repulsively powerful as "BUI
Jlii/rgf, being in as marked contrast to Miss
TCT.LKN TERRY, as was Caliban to Miranda.
Mr. NORMAN FORBES was perfect as the
silly, simple, fussing parson ; and Mr. BUN
WEBSTER, most ingeniously made up, did
his utmost to make something out of a
very, very small part, as did also Miss
ROSE LECLERCQ in what was, he supposed,
intended by the authors to be the "lipht
comedy" portion of the play. The plot
of the play was weak and uninteresting.
There was, here and there, a sharp line
in it, but as a whole the dialogue was
commonplace. Did he think Sir HENRY
was hypnotised and going against his
better judgment in the production? Well,
he was bound to say it did look uncom-
monlv like it; but he hoped the offenders
would be leniently dealt with, and merely
bound over to keep the piece—that is,
their next piece—to themselves. He
thought they might be dismissed with a
caution, or ordered to come up for judg-
ment a few months hence, if called upon
to do so.

Hiiust of Cummuns, Monday, Alay 2.—
It's all very well for MACDONA to get it
put in the papers that his trip to China
is undertaken for party and patriotic pur-
poses. The MARKISS, cavillers say, has not
made so much out of dismembered China
aa might have been expected from GEORGE
CTJRZON'S colleague. The Empire is there-
by the poorer, and the Unionist Party
suffer. Rotherhithe to the rescue!
MACDONA, representing a private syndi-
cate, will go out and see whether Germany
and Russia combined can withstand
Rotherhithe.

'* I •' -V . ifs
In days succeeding, coming early or com-
ing late, he found his on u familiar berth
occupied. To-night hailed the SPEAKER
from moorings at further end of bench
below gangway. House, discovering his
plight, roared with laughter and cheers.
But what's fun to them is death to the
simple-natured, warm-hearted old Salt,
who had grown affectionately attached to
his quarters.
Heaven is just, and the CAP'EN has not
been solitary in his sorrow. MACDONA,
spectator of it, suffered at least as much.
Couldn't sleep o" nights; lost his appetite;
finally resolved to flee the country. Try
China; combine business with penitence.
This the true inwardness of his disappear-
labours." All very well for young things
like LORD CHANCELLOR to make light of
superhuman effort. But we must take
care of the MAKKISS.
There is the staff, too, to be considered.
No one who hasn't been Black Rod can
imagine how wearing it is to mind and
body solemnly to put on a sword-girt
ancient uniform preparatory to attending
in state a sitting of one branch of the High
Court of Parliament, and five minutes later
to be slipping out of it into a suit of dittos.
It is the same in degree with all the
officials of an underpaid, overworked staff,
who too seldom receive mark of the public
sympathy, which nevertheless unobtrusively
abides with them.

OUSTING THE MAILED FIST!
A new (and rather dangerous) game for respectable middle-aged, and elderly gentlemen.—It requires no sense of humour.
That's MACDONA'S version, and Whip
WALROND, moving to-day that he be dis-
charged (as from a torpedo) from service
on the Petroleum Committee, loyally
backed him up. SARK knows better.
Remorse, not unaccompanied by fear,
accounts for MACDONA'S night. Just after
Members came back from holiday, CAP'EN
TOMMY BOWLES, making for his moorings
astern the Treasury Bench, found them |
occupied by another craft. MACDONA,
dropping down a tide ahead of TOMMY,
had secured the berth. The CAP'EN natu-
rally thought it was all a mistake, that
MACDONA would sheer off as soon as he
hove in sight. Not a bit of it. The
"XT>'RN. affecting to regard the matter in
light of joke, winked his weather eye, and
playfully poked MACDONA in the ribs with
his mailed fist. MACDONA threatened to
report him to the Harbour-master if he
didn't keep clear. The CAP'EN, almost
dazed by tnis audacity, paid out his cable
and cruised about below the gangway,
feeling more like a derelict than he had
done since he was launched.

bers show disposition to pocket their bribe
and go quietly away. The Nationalists
equally ready to pouch their share of the
plunder; but they won't go quietly away.

he speaks what will make two columns'

JOHN DILLON to have only a column and
three-quarters. That put right, other
Members insist on getting their share.
SARK says if BROTHER GERALD could only
manage to cut the cables that connect the
sister islands his Bill would be through
Committee in a week.
Amidst clamour of incessant talk, DALY
suddenly flashes luminous forefinger on
fatal flaw in Bill. Sub-section of clause 13
empowers LORD CHANCELLOR to remove
from office any county coroner whom he
may regard as incapacitated for duty.
"Sir," said Mr. DALY, fixing the faltering
Chairman with flaming eye, " I remember
a few years ago there was much unplea-
santness about removable magistrates.
Now, Mr. LOWTHER, I don't want to see
the county coroner made a removable
fixture."
Committee roared with laughter. DALY
regarded their flippancy with puzzled, yet
haughty, stare. All very well for them to
laugh. Laughter no argument. Let them,
rather, set about to cut out from the heart
of the Bill this cankering worm. Through
the saddening century Ireland has suffered
much at the hands of the Saxon. To have
her county coroners made removable fix-
tures may prove the last straw that will
open the door to insert the wedge of

EASTWARD HOCH!
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—I read in the daily
papers that France is urging the Celestial
Cow at Pekin to consent to be milked to
the extent of thousands of square miles ol
territory, and that Germany, with a view
of checkmating both England and Russia,
is supporting her Gallic neighbour's pre-
tension. Very likely, but not wholly with
that object if my Rontgen Ray perception
be of any account. Let me explain why:
The population of France, unlike that of
every other country, decreases year by
year. No one knows this better than an
Imperial Personage always on the Spree.
He has said to himself, "Hum! hum 1 ha!
ha! in a few years there will not be enough
citizens to people France itself. Good,
wonder-bright idea! Let us encourage
them, meantime, to plant the Tricolour
in all the remotest parts of the earth, and
drain the Patrie of its fighting sons.

A song fraught with meaning,

OUB, BOOKING-OFFICE.
Lady JezeltllC. ARTHUR PKARSON, LTD.) IB a story "with a
vengeance 1" How this vengeance is worked out, how retribution
falls on the wicked, and how the good are rewarded, will be
ascertained by the numerous readers to whom this weird sen-
sational story will appeal, and to whom the Baron confidently
recommends it. There is in the heroine a touch of Mrs. Skeleton,
mother-in-law of Mr. Dombey, with a dash of Mist Havisham in
Or eat Expectations; while, in the plot itself, there is just a remi-
niscence of WILKIE COLLINS'a Moonstone. All the same, it is none
the worse for this flavouring, probably accidental. Dr. Harry
Dark is the hero, and the tragic ecenes take place in the house of
his aunt, which, as the reader will already have guessed, is a
"aunted 'ouse.
My Baronite suspects that Mars (HurcHlNSON) would never
have been written if S. DARLING BARKER had not read The
Heavenly Twins. The skittish, reckless, warm-hearted, well-
meaning girl, of surpassing grace and beauty, is a difficult type
to mould. It does not find its highest exemplification in Mars,
whilst the effort at smartness in conversation, rarely rising above
slang, is repellant. Oue good thing in the book is the scene
where Mart meets the unrecognised destroyer of her father's life,
and, all unconsciously, wins him to the decision to make retribu-
tion. That has promise in it.
The Pen and Ink Sketches made during a P. and 0. Voyage by
Mr. HARRY FURMSS, published at Effingham House. Strand,
contain some of this artist's best work from his sharp-pointed
pencil. Ladies shown as "dressing under difficulties" is excel-
lent, of course as an effort of imagination, as how could a gentleman
artist be admitted to the mysteries of a lady's cabin, even during
the most eccentric conduct of the roughest and rudest sea
without at least getting a considerable '' dressing" himself? But
at the illustration facing p. 100 has not Mr. FURNISH slily shown
us "how it's done," by representing a little black-and-white chap
looking in at the port-hole of a lady's cabin? Perhaps.
In A Sun Through " The Nibelung's Sing," Mr. PHILIP LEST,IE
AONEW (BRADBURY, AONEW & Co.) gives us the clue to the
Wagnerian maze of Das Sheingold, Die Watture, Siegfried, and
Obtttrdammerung. To present a clear and concise summary of the
"plot" is a task that would have taxed the powers of the keenest
judge in summing-up, for the benefit of the jury, the case of
The Rhine Maidens Co. v. Wotan and Others, in which so many
interests of various parties to the suit are essentially involved.
This task, which might have been the thirteenth labour of Her-
cules, Mr. PHIIJP AONEW has triumphantly effected, and if a
converti^e to WAGNER wishes to become a master Cyclist (Wag-
nerian, not Bikerian), he cannot do better than study this book,
and so to master the master, and thoroughly appreciate the
operatic story of this golden legend of the Rhine and the Rhino.
That WAGNER was well up in nursery lore, and had more than
once seen a good old-fashioned English pantomime, when demons,
dwarfs, fairies, monsters, and big-headed people occupied the
stage, is, chez nous, a deep-seated conviction. What is one of the
principal situations in the opening but an adaptation of an incident
occurring in that truly sensational story, Puss in Soots!
This book appears just at the right moment, when the
Wagnerian operatic season has commenced. To every opera-
goer this brochure of Mr. PHIL AGNEW 8—who should now write
himself down as Mr. PHIL-HARMONIC AONEW—will be as inte-
resting as it is instructive; while to the pleasure felt by all
genuine Wagnerian "Cyclists" it will give a mest welcome
"fillip." THE BARON DB B.-W.

Local Government Bill threatens to stick

bers show disposition to pocket their bribe

equally ready to pouch their share of the

SARK says if BROTHER GERALD could only
manage to cut the cables that connect the
sister islands his Bill would be through
Committee in a week.
Amidst clamour of incessant talk, DALT
suddenly flashes luminous forefinger on
fatal flaw in Bill. Sub-section of clause 13
empowers LORD CHANCKLLOR to remove
from office any county coroner whom he
may regard as incapacitated for duty.
"Sir," said Mr. DALY, fixing the faltering
Chairman with flaming eye, "I remember
a few years ago there was much unplea-
santness about removable magistrates.
Now, Mr. LOWTHER, I don't want to see
the county coroner made a removable
fixture."
Committee roared with laughter. DALY
regarded their flippancy with puzzled, yet
haughty, stare. All very well for them to
laugh. Laughter no argument. Let them,
rather, set about to cut out from the heart
of the Bill this cankering worm. Through
the saddening century Ireland has suffered
much at the hands of the Saxon. To have
her county coroners made removable fix-
tures may prove the last straw that will
open the door to insert the wedge of
anarchy.

well-oiled hair. "Ah 1 those are ex-

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I read in the daily
papers that France is urging the Celestial
Cow at Pekin to consent to be milked to
the extent of thousands of square miles of
territory, and that Germany, with a view
of checkmating both England and Russia,
is supporting her Gallic neighbour's pre-
tension. Very likely, but not wholly with
that object if my Rontgen Ray perception
be of any account. Let me explain why?
The population of France, unlike that of
every other country, decreases year by
year. No one knows this better than an
Imperial Personage always on the Spree.
He has said to himself, "Hum! hum! ha!
ha I in a few years there will not be enough
citizens to people France itself. Good,
wonder-bright ideal Let us encourage
them, meantime, to plant the Tricolour
in all the remotest parts of the earth, and
drain the Patrie of its fighting sons.
When tlte European smash comes, what

to the million-maled fists of the Teutonic

Lady Jezebel (Q. ARTHTTB PEARSON, LTD.) is a story "with a
vengeance 1" How this vengeance is worked out, how retribution
falls on the wicked, and how the good are rewarded, will be
ascertained by the numerous readers to whom this weird sen-
sational story will appeal, and to whom the Baron confidently
recommends it. There is in the heroine a touch of Mrs. Skewton,
mother-in-law of Mr. Dombey, with a dash of Mist Havisham in
Great Expectation*; while, in the plot itself, there is just a remi-
niscence of WIIYKT K COLLINS'S Mumi-stonf. All the same, it is none
the worse for this flavouring, probably accidental. Dr. Harry
Durk is the hero, and the tragic scenes take place in the house of

does the opera offer to us now-a-days! German one night, French
another, and occasionally Italian! While the chorus, true to

[" The Lowther Arcade is to be sold by public auction early in May."—Daily Paper.']
[INDIGNATION MEETING BEING HELD AFTER CLOSING-TIME AT THE LOWTHER ARCADE, MR. JACK-IN-THE-BOX is THE CHAIR, TO
PROTEST AGAINST BUILDING A HUGE HOTEL OH THEATRE ON THE SITE OF THIS HISTORIC THOROUGHFARE.
THE FUTURE OF LOWTHER'ARCADIA.
IN the early hours of the morning a few
days since, an influential meeting of the
residents of the Lowther Arcade was held
to protest against the selling of the
Crown Lease. The Chair was occupied by
Mr. JACK-IN-THE-BOX.
The Chairman addressed the meeting.
He was glad to find before him so influen-
tial a gathering. They were there to pro-
test against any scheme that would drive
away the present industry from the Strand.
(Cheers.) He would detain them no longer,
but request his friend, the Master of the
Hunt, to move the first resolution.
Thus called upon, a doll in a red coat,
richly trimmed with gold lace, addressed
the meeting. He said he had known the
spot from the earliest period of his exist-
ence. He considered the place delightful
to every one. He thought it would be a
great mistake if the Lowther Arcade were
abolished. (Cheers.)
A gentleman, who described himself as
"the Miller," claimed for their residence the
title of "The True Temple of the
Legitimate Drama." Where in England
could be found that admirable production,
"The Miller and his Men," in all its per-
fection, from the first set-piece of "robbers
drinking," to the final "trick explosive
scene," with its red-fire stage directions?
(Cheers.) Where in all England could be
found a more brilliant orchestra, with its
musicians giving their undivided attention
to the scores before them, and the occu-
pants of the proscenium boxes devoting
their whole being to the play, although
from their position they were evidently un-
able to see any of the actions of the per-
formers P He protested against the destruc-
tion of the Lowther Arcade. (Cheeri.)
A green parrot said he wished to speak
on behalf of his fellow creatures in their dear
old home. They had been very happy there.
(A. btnt on the drum by the rabbit.) The
time had passed very pleasantly. (" Cow"
from the Stow* dock.) It had been the
"Ma, ma, 'from a seven-and-sixpenny speak-
ing dM.) It was the abode of harmony.
(The remainder of the parrot's speech was
drowned in the tunes of half- a-dozen musical
boxes.)
When silence was again secured, a tin
Lifeguards-man insisted on being heard.
He said that so far the speeches had been
pacific. But was that enough? ("Hear,
near.") Were they not able'j to defend
themselves P In his own shop—he begged
pardon, barracks—he knew that they had
laid in boxes no less than three thousand
infantry, an encampment with real tents,
and any number of batteries of artillery,
from the sixpenny pea-shooting gun up to
the two-guinea field-piece that let off real
gunpowder. (Cheers?} He would never

confess himself defeated, aid he trusted
that his bravery would soften the heart
of that mercenary female who had thrown
him over to accept the offer of a sixpenny
dearer rival. ("Shame.") But this was a
private matter. (" Hear, hear.") And as
a public man. he stuck to his motto of no
surrender. (Loud chetrs.)
At this point of the proceedings a door
was opened, a watchman entered, and the
dolls of the Lowther Arcade quickly assumed
the inanimate attitudes appropriate to list-
less toy hood.
MY CIGARETTE.
[" The cigarette, which was banned for so many
years by the faculty, is now upheld by the'Hotipital
as ' a panacea against many of the smaller ills of

ries."—Daily Graphic.]
TIME was they boded woes untold
Whene'er thy snowy length I rolled,
Croaking with raven voice that Death
Lurked in thine all too fragrant breath.
I heeded nothing what they said.
Nor marked the wisely-wagging head,
But, blindly loving, lingered yet
O'er thy sweet joys, my Cigarette!
And as I watched with dreaming eyes
Thine inter-wreathed fancies rise,
Lo! at thy magic softly stole
A peace divine upon my soul.
My troubles vanished. Filled with thee,
What was the weary world to me?
Sorrow and care I would forget
In thy sweet joys, my Cigarette I
But now thy dark eclipse is past,
Thine hour of triumph dawns at last;
While Slander, dumb and put to shame,

ALEXANDER, AND OTHER CONQUERORS.
TDK present play at the St. James's has yet some weeks to run,
and to our thinking that run could be, even now, considerably
prolonged. Mr. "TRILBY" POTTER'S drama, The Conquerors, is
marked by strong situations, somewhat too strong, as understood
by the majority of persons, and is most excellently acted. I do
not remember haying often seen Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER to
greater advantage than in this character of the wilful, unprin-
cipled school-boy lieutenant, whom nothing but a severe dig in
the back, with a knife, from the hand of a wildly impulsive lady
can bring to his senses; and I am fairly certain that Miss JULIA
NEILSON (Mrs. FRED TERRY) has rarely been more artistically
successful in the pourtrayal of any character than she is as Yvonne
de Orandpre. It is an admirable performance, as is also that of
her husband, Mr. FRED TEBRY, whose personal identity is com-
pletely lost in the characteristics of the French officer, Hugo. The
retention of the unnecessary, and painful incident of the two poor
tradesmen shot as spies by the brutal German general can only
be justified by the clever acting of Mr. HOLMES-GORE and Mr.
ARTHUR BOYSTON as Merle and Rotsignol (farcical names), and of
Mr. W. H. VBBNON as General Von Brandenberg. To my mind
it is perfectly possible to suppose Yivmne actuated by personal
and racial hatred of the invader. It is for the author to decide.
Miss FAY DAVIS, as Sabiole, is charmingly irresponsible, and
Mr. H. Y. KsMn.vn gaily and gallantly depicts the troubles of
a somewhat silly young Prussian struggling between love and
duty. Mr. H. B. IRVING is again a bilious-looking, cowardly
villain, a clever study in black and white; and Miss CONSTANCE
COLLIER'S peasant woman Jeanne Marie Bavdin, is a remarkable
and memorable performance. Mi. BEVKBIDGE'S Major Von Wolft-
hagen, with just that least taste in life of continental Corkasian
brogue, probably to be found in the BARI VON LINDENS of Ger-
many, is also excellent. The farcical French element or " comic
relief," brought in for Miss M. A. VICTOR, seems unnecessary,
but it may be taken as a proper balance to a piece, where all
The Conquerors being German, it is but fair that, on the French
side, there should be one irresistible maiden Victor.

the destruction of the American Fleet, and that Lafnyette be
FLITTINGS.
Johannesburg, April 18.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—They call this "the Golden City," but I
think it should be termed the Dust-heap. Every street is a
perfect dust-bin. On every other shop you will read the pathetic
notice, "Come in—closed on account of the dust." And this is
supposed to be the rainy season. What the place is like in the
Summer, I cannot imagine; but a " London particular" in Fleet
Street must be far preferable, judging from the little simooms
caused by the slightest amount of traffic. Even the solitary
water-cart raises more dust than it lays. There must be pecks
enough of Johannesburg dust to have ransomed any amount of
Reformers. As for the sportsmen who frequent the autumn
races at the suburb of Turffontein, they return each day looking
like golden dustmen, or stone-broke scavengers, as the case
may be.
Everybody, by the way, is complaining of depression, hard
times, and so forth, yet the tidy sum of £80,000 was subscribed
last week for the various sweepstakes, and the "totes" or
totalisators do a roaring trade.
Our good friends the Boers are so determined to Hollanderise
the place that they have erased the last three letters of the word
"street" on all the familiar blue and white enamel plates at
street corners. The policemen seem to be selected for their
inability to direct one in English. I was sent (with great civility,
be it admitted) to seven wrong places the other day in order to
find the Lost Property Office, and then failed to regain my be-
longings after all. And yet it is an English town—witness eight
smart hansoms that have recently appeared upon the streets.
On the whole, Johannesburg, the Gilt-edged, is not exactly an
earthly Paradise for the Outlander at present, and to-day we
shake its dust out of our clothes, and flit to the Garden Colony of
Natal. Yours, moving on, Z. Y. X.
Music AND MONEY.—Any speculator with good notes, up to a
tenor, may do worse than invest in BENNETT s "Maiden Mine,"
It properly worked, the returns should be considerable. When
Mr. WHITNEY TEW " obliges again," why not associate his name
with tie celebrated " Tew m'ami" f If this doesn't suit his voice
then let him try a change of air. We 're sure he will be only
captured by a cruiser of the United States.

EXTRACTED F&OM THB DIAUY OP TOBY, H.P.
of Commons, Monday, May 9. —
GEOBGE CUR/ON back to-night after long
bout of sickness. Pleasant to see the
hearty welcome that cheered his return.
Both sides vied with each other in genuine
heartiness of congratulation. The House
always prompt with kindliness of this
nature. But there are degrees of warmth,
and the warmest was showered on the
young Under-Secretary. This all the more
gratifying because it is a position won
against certain disadvantages.
One is attributable to his godfathers and
godmothers in his baptism. Why they
should have inflicted upon him, even on
second thoughts, the name of NATHANIEL
is a secret discreetly lodged in their tomb.
It gives an opening to persons of small
spite, who, when they can allege nothing
new against an annoyingly successful
young man. with subtle inflection of voice
allude to him as " GEOKQE NATHANIEL."
Then he brought from the University, with
other youthful possessions pathetically
envied by older men, a certain cock-
sureness attested by a couplet of alluring
banality. If the manner had been all, it
would have been offensive. Behind it was
a resolute will, a settled purpose, native
capacity, and, not least, a habit of industry,
and love of work.
The Ilouse of Commons, as SA&K may
have said before, is the quickest and surest
j udge of character in the world. It hesi-
tated for some time about GEORGE CURZON,
person theory. Perhaps he would still
have suffered from that libel if PBINCE
ARTHUR, who knew him intimately, had
not secured for him opportunity of showing
the metal he is made of. That given, the
rest was certain. It would be tragic if so
promising a career were cut short by
physical infirmity. House generously and
genuinely pleased to find that rumour also
was a fable.

entering House to-night on a holiday visit,
home from his Governorship of Victoria,
uttered a hurried oath. The Recording
Angel, like Mr. Toots and Lord SALISBURY,
would say it was "of no consequence,"
being merely the customary ceremony on a
peer taking his seat for the first time in a
new Parliament.
Since BRASSEY carried an added Sunbeam
into the waters of Australasia a great deal
has happened. Coining back, he is, SAUK
says, chiefly struck by the extreme quiet-
ness of things. That not unnatural, since
never had a peace-loving, equable-tempered
Governor such a series of adventures
as have befallen BRASSEY since he left
the Thames. He began by being nearly
wrecked, running into Cape Town for
safety. On laud he was pitched off his
horse. At sea he tumbled in out of his
boat.
All things considered, looks pretty well.
Mustn't be hard on us if we live more
monotonous lives, especially in Parliament.
morning struggle for CAP'KN TOMMY'S
moorings, and the excitement of betting
on the daily event, suicide would be an
inevitable relaxation. The Lords more
accustomed to that kind of thing. Life
with them is a perpetually placid pool,
stirred only by the emotion of excitement
as to whether the sitting shall be strictly
limited to five minutes' duration, or whether,
as CANNING threatened the Dutch, they
should " clap on twenty per cent."

famous raid. Decided to postpone inten-
tion, and said so. When he sat down up
gat the Duke, and began what was doubt-
less a convincing and eloquent speech.
"My lords," he said, " I rise to join in
the appeal which has been made by my
noble friend"
Quite a crowded House in anticipation of
interesting debate. Noble lords stared in
amaze at his Grace, who was evidently
getting into stride with his speech, under
impression that CAKRINGTON had made his.
Half-a-dozen hands pulled at the ducal
coat-tails; CARRINGTON explained he hadn't
given the cue; FIFE mustn't play with-
out the drum; so the Duke (of course,
in a Parliamentary sense) "died with all
his music in him."

flu tat of Common*, Monday, May 9.—
GEOROE CUR/ON back to-nighc after long
bout of sickness. Pleasant to see the
hearty -welcome that cheered his return.
Both sides vied with each other in genuine
heartiness of congratulation. The House
always prompt with kindliness of this
nature. But there are degrees of warmth,
and the warmest was showered on the
young Under-Secretary. This all the more
gratifying because it is a position won
against certain disadvantages.
One is attributable to his godfathers and
godmothers in his baptism. Why they
should haye inflicted upon him, eyeu on
second thoughts, the name of NATHANIEL
is a secret discreetly lodged in their tomb.
It gives an opening to persons of small
spite, who, when they can allege nothing
new against an annoyingly successful
young man. with subtle inflection of voice
allude to him as " GBOMOE NATHANIEL."
Then he brought from the University, with
other youthful possessions pathetically
euvied by older men, a certain cock-
sureness attested by a couplet of alluring
banality. If the manner had been all, it
would nave been offensive. Behind it was
a resolute will, a settled purpose, native
capacity, and, not least, a habit of industry,
and love of work.
The House of Commons, as SAKK may
have said before, is the quickest and surest
judge of character in the world. It hesi-
tated for some time about GKOROK CURZON,
person theory. Perhaps he would still
have suffered from that libel if PRINCE
ARTHUR, who knew him intimately, had
not secured for him opportunity of showing
the metal he is made of. That given, the
rest was certain. It would be tragic if so
promising a career were cut short by
physical infirmity. House generously and
genuinely pleased to find that rumour also
was a fable.
liusiness dont.—Through Budget Resolu-
tion in Committee of Ways and Means like
winking.
House of Lords, Tuesday.—Lord BRA88EY
entering House to-night on a holiday visit,
home from his Governorship of Victoria,
uttered a hurried oath. The Recording
Angel, like Mr. Toots and Lord SALISBURY,
would say it was "of no consequence,"
being merely the customary ceremony on a
peer taking his seat for the first time in a
new Parliament.
Since B&ASSET carried an added Sunbeam
into the waters of Australasia a great deal
has happened. Coming back, he is, SARK
says, chiefly struck by the extreme quiet-
ness of things. That not unnatural, since
never had a peace-loving, equable-tempered
Governor such a series of adventures
as have befallen BRASSKY since he left
the Thames. He began by being nearly
wrecked, running into Cape Town for
safety. On laud he was pitched off his
horse. At sea he tumbled in out of his
boat.
All things considered, looks pretty well.
Mustn't be hard on us if we live more
monotonous lives, especially in Parliament.
morning struggle for CAP'KN TOMMY'S
moorings, and the excitement of betting
on the daily event, suicide would be an
inevitable relaxation. The Lords more
accustomed to that kind of thing. Life
with them is a perpetually placid pool,
stirred only by the emotion of excitement
as to whether the sitting shall be strictly
limited to five minutes' duration, or whether,
as CANNING threatened the Dutch, they
should " clap on twenty per cent."
To-night Duke of flH almost ruffled
equanimity by attempting irregularly to
work off a speech. CARRINOTON had given
notice to raise question of restoration of
commissions to Dr. JIM'S comrades in his
famous raid. Decided to postpone inten-
tion, and said so. When he sat down up
gat the Duke, and began what was doubt-
less a convincing and eloquent speech.
"My lords," he said, " I rise to join in
the appeal which has been made by my
noble friend"
Quite a crowded House in anticipation of
interesting debate. Noble lords stared in
amaze at his Grace, who was evidently
getting into stride with his speech, under
impression that CARRINQTON had made his.
Half-a-dozen hands pulled at the ducal
coat-tails; CARRINOTON explained he hadn't
given the cue; Fll'E mustn't play with-
out the drum; so the Duke (of course,
in a Parliamentary sense) "died with all
hiH music in him."

quiet evening in Committee on Irish Local
Government Bill. Quiet scarcely the word
for it; dull better, drearily, dolefully dull.
But as habitually happens, dullness means
business. It's on your firework nights
that no real work is done. Attendance
chiefly confined to Irish representatives.
When bell rings some two or three hundred
Britishers come in to vote. That, they
think, is all that can be expected of them.
With occasional assistance of ATTOBNBY-
GENERAL, and comforting, if silent, pre-
sence of DUNBAR BARTON, GERALD BAL-
KCIUH slowly fights his Bill through
thicket of amendments. Rarely has simi-
lar work been better done. Patient, cour-

uiih a firm grip that knows when tempo-
rarily to relax, he disarms opposition.
Till HEALY, Truculent no longer, takes
him tenderly under his wing. Only for
that, JOHN DILLON would be equally
friendly. The landlords, who at the outset
breathed fire and sword, threatened revolt
and rapine, have disappeared from the
scene. Over it rests the kindly smile of
CHARLES HARE HEMPHILL, sometime H. M.

sole representative of the late Government
on the front Opposition Bench. HEMP-

vantage to Minister in charge of a Bill.
It expresses the essence of mellifluous good
temper, is the very embodiment of peace.
"A thorough-going Home Ruler, friend-

"yet he doesn't look as if he could say
'Boh I' to a rack-renting landlord. The
sort of man you 'd expect to find quietly
drawing from somewhere a pension of
£1.000 a year paid in guineas."

uncomfortable sensation of his proximity;
their flesh creeps with apprehension of any
moment feeling on their shoulder the hand
of his myrmidons.
Try to pump Sir WILFRID; attempt to
bribe him with offer of unlimited refresh-
ment. He only stares into space, or,
looking round the lobby, lets his eye
casually, as it were, rest upon the but-
toned and belted figure of policeman.

answer this requirement:—
ROYAL OPEBA, COVENT GARDEN.—This
evoking at 8. Lohengrin. Gentlemen
must wear coats, known as "swallow-taila,"
and trousers, both entirely of black cloth.
Coloured coats not allowed, but dinner
lackets winked at. Shepherd's plaid
trousers, and fancy checks forbilden.
Waistcoats may be black or white, the
front wide open. Knitted jerseys not
allowed. White shirts with starched linen
fronts absolutely essential. Flannel shirts
forbidden. White collars, and white or
black ties indispensable. Socks of black
silk. Boots or shoes of black leather,
known as "patent." The colours and
in it (-rials of under vests and braces are

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THERE is not anything left to be said in praise of Pendennis,
the second volume of the Biographical Edition of THACKERAY'S
works just issued by SMITH, ELDER. But the familiar friend has
an added charm in the introduction by the novelist's daughter.
THACKERAY, like SHAKSPEARE and TENNYSON, left peremptory in-
struction that no attempt should be made to write his life. The
mandate only partially prevailed in the case of SHAKSPEARE. The
uniqueness of his position amongst men is finally attested by the
fact that though practically no materials for chronicling his life
exist, volumes about himself and his supposititious doings crowd
the book shelves. TENNYSON'S memoirs by his son were pub-
lished the other day. Now Mrs. RITCHIE, with loving, discreet
hand, lifts the veil from the household figure of THACKERAY,
and shews him at school, with his family, at his work with pen
and pencil. It is a new and happy thought to supply the record
piecemeal, doling out chapters, each one pertaining to the
period at which a particular novel was written. We like the old
book all the more when we read how, making holiday at Spa,
THACKERAY "had another good spell with the first chapter of
Pendennis this morning before breakfast, such a good one as
authorised two mutton chops along with my coffee." "Having
completed my story this day," he writes to his mother just forty-
eight years ago, "and wrote [only a great author could thus
flout LINLEY MURRAY"] Finis, I am very tired, weary, and solemn-
minded, so I say God bless my dearest mother and G. P. ere I
try to go and get some sleep." My Baronite turns over the
well-remembered pages of the first chapter and the last, and
finds new pleasure in the closer touch with THACKERAY made
possible by these notes.
My Baronite holds that a pretty homily called Sowing
the Sand (HARPER) should be carried in the sabre-tache of every
cavalry subaltern, and also circulated among reckless senior
officers who ought to be old enough to know better. It will
teach them not to encourage the young to sow wild oats on the
beach of time. At present it seems that they do not " realise"
their responsibility. Mrs. HBNNIKER-MAJOR (though she is
accustomed to waive her military rank and call herself FLORENCE
HENNIKER, as here) is a practical soldier-woman; and if the
scenes of this book chiefly alternate between country-houses and
race-meetings, where war-paint is not wanted, you know that she
would be just as good on parade or in the mess-room. This,
among other qualities, distinguishes her from the common mili-
tary authoress. Her style has an unstudied ease; her people
talk and live as people actually do; and her men are not less
alive than her women. Only now and then the sense of her duty
as a book-maker (off the course) weighs upon her; at such times
her botanical deviations have perhaps a certain suggestion of
perfunctoriness. For the rest, sne is refreshingly natural. Alex
Devereux, only lightly sketched, as most of her characters, is a
charming study; and so is Major Savile, who fails to "realise"
what a lot of graceful mischief he is doing in his picturesque
career. THE BARON DE B.-W.
OPERATIC NOTES.
MADAME EMMA EAMES a musically charming Juliet, but,
dramatically, too staid a young person for WILL SHAKSPEARE'S
heroine. M. SALEZA vocally excellent and dramatically energetic
as the love-sick Itomeu. PLANCON admirable as "holy Fnar."
The reverend gentleman must have belonged to rather a Go-as-
you-please Religious Order to have been able to celebrate a quiet
marriage service in his own private cell, where Romeo and Juliet
are married by "special Shakspearian licence."
Tuesday.—Audience drawn to Opera to-night by two "Gees,"
i.e., GOTTNOD and GLTTCK. Philemon et liaucis and OrpMe,
both in French. The first specially delightful; second too long.
In the hitter, Miss MARGARET HKID was "un amour" comme
L'Amour, and Mis* SUZANNE ADAMSJ a pretty Eurydice, with the
song of the Opera. We were looking forward to the Nozze in
Italian for Thursday, but on a change toui cela, and it is to be
an encore of ZELIE DE LTTSSAN in Carmen.
Wednesday.—" Lohengrin-and-bear-it," is the non-Wagnerian
motto. But the non-\\ag had better stay away and come for
the Nozze, which was to have been to-morrow, and now we shall
not see Nozze, as the Opera is to be Carmen. DE RESZKE, the
"Johnnie " of that ilk, excellent, aind Madame NORDICA perfect.
Von MILDE, as king, quite Von STRONG. Taking into considera-
tion the extreme youth of the boys and girls engaged as chorus,
it isn't half bad. But isn't there a law about keeping up such
very young persons after early bed-time hours? However, that
is a question for the management. House full and enthusiastic.
Thursday.—Canne.n, with ZELIE DE LUSSAN, always good.
What has become of Nozze? Evidently some hitch in Figaro's
wedding, as announced, with the fair SUZANNE.
Friday.—A French and German Alliance night. Tannhauser,
in French, with chorus of pilgrims straight from Rome, singing
in Italian, and after that, polyglottic. King PLANCON, regal;
Mynheer VAN DYCK dramatically and vocally good; and as
Wolfram (awful animal combination suggested by name), Mr.
RENAUD excellent. His song to the star, in Act 111., exqui-
sitely sung, would have delighted the shade of Dr. WATTS, whose
poem of "Twinkle, twinkle, little star," probably suggested the
idea to Warbling Wagner.
THE JAPAN DINNER.
(From Notes made on the Spot.)
Friday.—Dining with Japanese Society at Meiropole. Gorge-
ous affair. His Excellency TAKAAKI KATO, the Japanese Minister,
in the chair. MARK ANTONY ought to have been here to meet
KATO. Dinner enlivened by strains of Bijou Orchestra discours-
ing sweet music—(good champagne)—composed by Treasurer of
Society, a remarkably fair-sk>nned, good-looking gentleman, ITO
MUTCHAI DINA BEVANIHHI. (Capital cham!)
Then, a little later, immensely tall Jap, with flowing bowl
—I mean "beard "—I 'm all right—(first-rate cham—glass with
you, certainly)—I did see this very tall, bearded Japanesj
nobleman (LANKAI-EARLI-SPBNCA) rise on his hind legs
and hear him make excellent speech about Japan. It strikes
me his English is remarkably good. Another native noble-
man, the Lord High Admiral CHARLAI TAKASEATATYORKO, also
'dresses us. (Never tast'd lerrer champ'ne!) Seems to know '11
about it. Not speak good English. Forget all rest —
begin to get sleepy. Am much 'debted—humorous gen'leman,

what a lot of graceful mischief he is doing in his picturesque
career. THE BARON DE B.-W.
OPERATIC NOTES.
MADAME EMMA EAMES a musically charming Juliet, hut,
dramatically, too staid a young person for WILL SHAKSPEARE'S
heroine. M. SALEZA vocally excellent and dramatically energetic
as the love-sick Itomeo. PLANCON admirable as "holy Friar."
The reverend gentleman must have belonged to rather a Go-as-
you-please Religious Order to have been able to celebrate a quiet
marriage service in his own private cell, where Borneo and Juliet
are married by "special Shakespearian licence."
Tuesday.—Audience drawn to Opera to-night by two "Gees,"
i.e., GOTTNOD and GLUCK. Philemon et Baucis and Orpliee,
both in French. The first specially delightful; second too long.
In the latter. Miss MARGARET RKH> was "un amour" comme
L'Amour, and Mist SUZANNE ADAMS, a pretty Eurydice, with the
song of the Opera. We were looking forward to the Nozze in
Italian for Thursday, but on o change toiJt cela, and it is to be
an encore of ZELIE DE LUBSAN in Carmen.
Wednesday.—" Lohengrin-and-bear-it," is the non-Wagnerian
motto. But the non-\\ag had better stay away and come for
the Nozze, which was to have been to-morrow, and now we shall
not see Notze, as the Opera is to be Carmen. DE RESZKE, the
"Johnnie" of that ilk, excellent, and Madame NORDICA perfect.
Von MILDE, as king, quite Von STRONG. Taking into considera-
tion the extreme youth of the boys and girls engaged as chorus,
it isn't half bad. But isn't there a law about keeping up such
very young persons after early bed-time hours? However, that
is a question for the management. House full and enthusiastic.
Thursday.—Carmen, with ZELIE DE LUSSAN, always good.
What has become of Nozze? Evidently some hitch in Figaro's
wedding, as announced, with the fair SUZANNE.
Friday.—A French and German Alliance night. Tannhauser,
in French, with chorus of pilgrims straight from Rome, singing
in Italian, and after that, polyglottic. King PLANCON, regal;
Mynheer VAN DYCK dramatically and vocally good; and as
Wolfram (awful animal combination suggested by name), Mr.
RENAUD excellent. His song to the star, in Act III., exqui-
sitely sung, would have delighted the shade of Dr. WATTS, whose
poem of "Twinkle, twinkle, little star," probably suggested the
idea to Warbling Wagner.
THE JAPAN DINNER.
(From Notes made on the Spot.)
Friday.—Dining with Japanese Society at Me'tropole. Gorge-
ous affair. His Excellency TAKAAKI KATO, the Japanese Minister,
in the chair. MARK ANTONY ought to have been here to meet
KATO. Dinner enlivened by strains of Bijou Orchestra discours-
ing sweet music—(good champagne)—composed by Treasurer of
Society, a remarkably fair-skinned, good-looking gentleman, ITO
MUTCHAI DINA BEVANISHI. (Capita? cham!)
Then, a little later, immensely tall Jap, with flowing bowl
—I mean "beard "—I "m all right—(first-rate cham—glass unth
you, certainly)—I did see this very tall, bearded Japanese
nobleman (LANKAi-EAHu-SpENCA) rise on his hind legs
and hear him make excellent speech about Japan. It strikes
me his English is remarkably good. Another native noble-
man, the Lord High Admiral CHARLAI TAKASEATATYORKO, also
'dresses us. (Never tast'd berrer champ'ne!) Seems to know '11

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DARBY JONES ON THE DEEBY.
ONCE more, honoured Sir, the Blue
Ribbon of the Turf is waiting for a. worthy
Recipient of the Honour, and it is some
what quaint that the quadruped bearing
the name of the Illustrious Statesman who
confounded the Order of the Garter with
French Cooks in his simile, should now be
Premier Favourite for the Great Race,
which many Foreigners of my acquaintance
believe to be run in the County of the
Peak.
Indeed, it was only yesterday that I
received a letter from my esteemed friend,
Count GHOGONOFF, of Warsaw, regretting
that the CZAR had forestalled him in the
purchase of Qaltee More, but announcing
that he fully intends to buy this year's
winner, "si c'est possible de trouver cette
miserable rillc de Derby." The Count is a
Down-trodden Pole, and to discover his
whereabouts is, I may mention, the con-
stant object of many Russian explorers.
Hence his antipathy to the Autocrat of
All the Russias, the exact number of which
I have never been able to ascertain, even
with the assistance of that Universal Guide
to the Best Society known as the Almanack
de Gotha, no doubt published under the
special supervision of our whilom Duke of
EDINBTTKOH. Of course, I have written to
the Count to an address in Paris, which
need nofc be mentioned, explaining that
our National Racing Carnival is held on the
Chalk Downs of Epsom, and not in the
vicinity of the Head-quarters of the Mid
land Railway Company.
I think that this Illustrious Nobleman
(he ought to be King of CRACOW) will be
a Great Addition to the Sporting Circles pt
the British Empire. He is a Napoleon in
strategy, and withal a Cosmopolitan Hu-
mourist. At Deauville Races, many years
ago, when I first made his acquaintance,
he remarked, in his Franco-Polo-English,
"I have put my rhemiae on Gil Bias, for
if 'e do not win I could not afford to 'ave
'im wash." Luckily, the Horse in question
was worthy of the Count's confidence. 1
shall certainly introduce this Eminent Con-
tinental Sportsman to my friend Captain
KRJTERION, the talented author of "Four-
year-olds that have Won the. Derby," an
exhaustive work, which all Pubjishers have
refused to issue by reason of their Cowardly
Fear of the Law of Libel. I think that if
the Count and the Captain put their know-
ledge-boxes together, tyred hansoms will
not be wanting them to run rapidly to all
suburban meetings.
Epsom, honoured Sir. is never a delight-
ful spot. If the Sun be shining and the
Breeze blowing, your complexion speedily
rivals that of a corryfay (shaky on the
spelling) at one of the Lighter Theatres;
if, on the contrary, the Tears of the
Heavens descend, the most superbly at-
tired personage, after ascending the Hill,
speedily assumes the guise of a hard-
working Miller or Journeyman Plasterer.
Epsom is either all glare or all gloom.
But it is certainly as business-like as the
Stock Exchange, and a Country Cousin,
who has just bolted the Rough and Ready
Fare afforded by the Grand Stand Refresh-
ment Rooms, may go into the Ring and
lose thousands of pounds in company with
Dukes, County Councillors and Curates
out of work. That is where the Glorious
Socialism of the Derby Day -omes in.
East and West, North and South mingle

'WHERE DO THE BEES GET THE HONEY FROM, DADDY?,"
"WHY, FROM THE FLOWERS, OF COURSE, TOMMY. I DID THINK vov KNEW AS MVCH AS THAT!

and all manner of other Points of the
Compass. Depend upon it, when they
used to adjourn the House of Commons
for the Derby, Honourable Members knew
where they would meet with their consti-
tuents. I even believe that Sir WILFRID
LAWSON would, if he trod the classic Turf,
meet some of his most ardent supporters
from Cumberland.
But to revert to Surrey, and chortling
Charlie is my Darling, I break with a cue
needing some handling, in order to chalk
my tip up to the Expectation of Yourself
and other Noble Patrons. Never mind;
give me the rest that we all require. 1

not so flattering epithet. But with your
esteemed confidence, I would draw upon

journalists, when they were funny, were
always sent to Siberia?
S. C. Yes; that's why he is so pleased
at having fallen into the hands of the
English. You see, they've now got a hurdle
strapped on to tiro bikes. And now they
put that wounded man on it.

ON AN " ORIGINAL IDEA " AT THE ROYALTY
THEATRE.—Sir,—I have not yet seen My
Innocent Boy, but have read several criti-
cisms on it, wherein the writers praise the
authors of this farcical comedy for their
original idea of a widower with a marriage-
able daughter, wishing to keep her exist-
ence in the background in order that he
may wed a young girl. Not very original,
seeing that this idea is the essence of the
plot of Little Toddlekins, in which CHARLES
MATHEWS and Mrs. FRANK MATTHEWS were
so admirable. CHARLES MATHEWS was the
widower, engaged to be married, who spoke
of his daughter, that is, his step-daughter,
a lady of about forty, as a mere child,
in fact, as "Little Toddlekins." If the
essential motive of the plot of My Inn-n-
cent Soy is not precisely the same, it
seems, as described by those who ought
to be competent professional witnesses,
uncommonly like it. Yours truly,
LAUDATOR TEMPORIS ACTI.
P.S.—It is modestly advertised as "The
Best Farcical Comedy ever produced in

A KEW-RIOUS CALCULATION.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—An official publica-
tion promulgated for the benefit of the
few, not the many, called the Kew Bulletin,
has just been issued. It states that the
number of visitors to the Royal Garden*
during the past year (1897) was 1,239,683,
being 157,192 less than in the preceding
year (1896). The total number of visitors
on Sundays was 485,544, and on weekdays
amounted to 754,139. The largest score
was 84.431 on June 7, and the smallest
57 on March 18. Then follows an elaborate
table of the attendance during every
month in the year.
IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY INTERESTING
to ascertain how these accurate returns are
determined. There are six public en-
trances into the Gardens, not one being
provided with a turnstile. Scores of visi-
tors pass the gates without even seeing
or being seen by the German-General-
attired guardians of the portals, hundreds
of residents in the neighbourhood often
use the Gardens two or three times a day,
and there are several official entrances.
No gatekeeper has ever been known to
check anything except the prohibited hand-
bags of the visitors. \Vbenoe, then, is
this elaborate and circumstantial state-
ment derived? Perhaps Mr. THISELTON-
DTER could explain. I am certain that no
one else could, except perhaps the Cormo-
rant. The fact of the matter is that a
strong effort is being made to prove that
the General Public does not need earlier
opening of their own property. Nova
aro to be issued let them be trustworthy;
and the only way in which they .--an so be
rendered is by the erection of turnstiles
at all the gates. Unfortunately, "faked"
statements like that issued by the Kew
Jiulletin are often accepted as Gospel
Truth in Parliament and Press. And Mr.
THISELTON-DYER is an acknowledged apos-
tle of culture—especially of Haughty-
culture. Yours obediently,
VICTORIA REGIA.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OP TOBY, M.I'.
House of Commons, Monday, May 16.—
Cleverness of Ministry in compounding
Irish Local Government Bill has hitherto
met with full reward. The recipe alluringly
perfect. "Take," as the cookery books
say, three-quarters of a million sterling per
annum out of Imperial Exchequer; divide
it into two pretty equal proportions; give
one to the landlords, one to the tenants.
In serving out, dress the dish with revo-
lutionary sauce composed of reform in local
government; flavour it so that it may as
nearly as possible resemble Home Rule,
only on no account let that name appear
on any of the labels. Stir well and serve
hot.
None of your company will thoroughly
like the dish: but all will partake of it.
Landlords (holding their nose against the
odour of Home Rule) because of their
share of the three-quarters of a million:
Home Rule flavour) because of the money
bribe and the concession of demands which
exceed ISAAC BUTT'S first Home Rule
scheme; Right Hon. gentlemen on Front
Opposition Bench, and the party that leads
them, because a Conservative Government
is practically doing what, in attempting
to accomplish three years ago, they them-
selves came a cropper; the Conservative
majority because they are good boys, and
do what they are told. Only person not
considered or consulted is the British tax-
payer, who will have to find next year,
and through all succeeding years, the
three-quarters of a million with which the
pill is gilded.
Hitherto discussion in Committee been
left almost entirely to Irish Members.
To-night clause reached which absolutely
pledges House to vote the money. Almost
startling to hear the English accent in
other voice than that of BROTHER GERALD.
LAMBERT moved to omit provision in clause
which secures payment of the landlord's
bribe. Honest MICHAEL DAVITT, who is
neither to be coerced nor coddled, sup-
ported amendment. WILFRID LAWSON,
summing up differences between ROBIN
HOOD and HER MAJESTY'S Government,
preferred the single gentleman. He robbed
the rich to help the poor. They plundered
the poor to fill the pockets of the rich.
General topsy-turviness of situation illus-
trated by TIM HEALY lending a knee to
BROTHER GERALD whilst he fought these
cavillers. Opposition, of course, of no
avail. Only 70 went into the division
lobby to support amendment, 235 flocking

1'retty to see the MARKISS'S look of
polite surprise at the latter reference.
Speech? DON JOSE? Long Spoon'( Dear
me 1 KiMiiEiu.KY not a man apt to be
carried away by his imagination. Must be
something in it since he talks in this way.
DON JOSK certainly lives at Birmingham.
The MARKISS iaiicies he was formerly
in some business way connected witu
the town. Quite likely, therefore, tnat he
had been making a speech there. If only
it had occurred to l\iMIIHUI.KY to send him
(the MARKISS) an intimation that he in-
tended to refer to the matter, he would
have made inquiry; probably been able
to obtain a copy ot the alleged speech.
"Ag it is," added the MAHKISS, taking
up tne notice paper and critically exa-
mining the terms of KIMBERLEY'S inter-
polation, "it would be impossible for me
to see in this notice an intention on tlie
part of the noble earl to enter into a
lengthened examination of and dissertation
upon Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S speech at Bir-
mingham."
Thus airily dismissing the topic, discus-
sion of whicn rumbles through every capi-
tal in Europe, the MARKISS set himself in
matter of tact way to say as little as
possible about Wei-Hai-Wei.
Business done.—Commons pegging away
at Irish Local Government Bill.
*****
Thursday.—Shock of the news that comes
to-day from Hawarden, telling how at last
the silver cord is loosed, the golden bowl
broken, is lessened by the long note ot
preparation for the worst. Through weary
weeks the English-speaking people have
been sitting by the bedside of England's
greatest son, waiting for the inevitable
end, which those who loved the phtient
sufferer most were least willing to see
delayed. Nevertheless, now the blow hai
fallen, and men say to each other in hushed
voice, "GLADSTONE is dead!" there comes
upon the senses realisation of all it means
for mankind.
Here in the House of Commons, where
he chiefly lived, where for three-score
years, in sunshine and in shade, he played
a leading part, the gap is widest and
deepest. Since on March 1, 1894, he
quietly walked out, after making what
few who listened knew was his last
speech, we have had time to realise how
supreme was the guerdon of his daily
presence. It was not only that there was
withdrawn from debate the greatest Par-
liamentary orator of the century. With
his departure the House of Commons suf-
fered loss of a note of dignity, a colour-
ing of lofty character, which remain irre-
parable. Happily, the normal tone of per-
sonal conduct in the House of Commons
is high. Anything mean, unworthy the
character of an English gentleman, any
tendency to tamper with the truth,

Uleryifiiutn. "AUGUSTUS, WILT THOU TAKE THIS WOMAN'
Bride (late of Remnant it Co.'s Ribbon Department). "LADY!"
swiftly, angrily resented. Beyond and
above that ordinary condition there was
a something magnificently, (hough simply,
lofty in Mr. GLADSTONE'S moral attitude.
His strength was as the strength of ten
Because hi-, heart was pure.
He had a manner of old-fashioned
courtesy that was contagious in fashioning
debate. His subtle influence for good in
these respects was, up to the last, far-
reaching. When he sat on the Front
Bench on either side of the SPEAKER'S
chair, he was as a loadstone, concentrating
upon himself all regards. It was natural
enough that strangers in the gallery, pay-
ing a rare visit, should turn to feast their
eyes upon Mr. GLADSTONE. That wag a
touch nl nature that made them kin with
Members who saw him every day. If he
stood up to speak, he of course engrossed
attention. His distinction was that, when
lie sat as a listener, he was, in most cases,
more closely the object of regard than
h«- man speaking. Members watched
of this or that just said, and whether
there was probability of his being dragged
into the debate. Once on his legs the
brooding meditation bubbled into excite-
ment. From first to last, however far off
the last might be, he held the attention of
the House, charming it with his eloquence,
even where he could not convince it by
his argument.
The fascination he had for the House ot
Commons it wielded over him. When the
time for separation came, it was as hard to
think of him wending his way through
daily life without spending some hours in
the Commons as it was for the House
to conceive itself upstanding with this
prop withdrawn. It was an unpre-
meditated thing that he never re-entered
the House after his historic speech, when
he flung down what PBINCE ARTHUR de-
scribed as "a declaration of war against
the ancient constitution of these realms."
Perhaps he feared its potent spell. Having
deliberately resolved to retire from Par-
any suspicion of dishonest intent, is
liamentary life, he felt it wiser not to
him keenly, wondering what he thought

something in it since he talks in this way.
DON JOSK certainly lives at Birmingham.
The MARKISS fancies he was formerly
in some business way connected witn
the town. Quite likely, therefore, that he
had been making a speech there. If only
it had occurred to KIMBERLEY to send him
(the MARXISM an intimation that he in-
tended to refer to the matter, he would
have made inquiry; probably been able
to obtain a copy of the alleged speech.
"Ai it is," added the MARKI**, taking
up the notice paper and critically exa-
mining the terms of KJMBJSRLEY'S inter-
polation, "it would be impossible for me
to see in this notice an intention on tlie
part of the noble earl to enter into a
lengthened examination of and dissertation
upon Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S speech at Bir-
mingham."
Thus airily dismissing the topic, discus-
sion of whicii rumbles through every capi-
tal in Europe, the MAKKISS set himself in
matter of fact way to say as little as
possible about Wei-Hai-Wei.
Business done.—Commons pegging away

*****
Thursday.—Shock of the news that comes
to-day from Hawarden, telling how at last
the silver cord is loosed, the golden bowl
broken, is lessened by the long note of
preparation for the worst. Through weary
weeks the English-speaking people have
been sitting by the bedside of England's
greatest son, waiting for the inevitable
end, which those who loved the patient
sufferer most were least willing to see
delayed. Nevertheless, now the blow hai
fallen, and men say to each other in hushed
voice, "GLADSTONE is dead!" there comes
upon the senses realisation of all it means
for mankind.
Here in the House of Commons, TV here
he chiefly lived, where for three-score
years, in sunshine and in shade, he played
a leading part, the gap is widest and
deepest. Since on March 1, 1894, he
quietly walked out, after making what
few who listened knew was his last
speech, we have had time to realise how
supreme was the guerdon of his daily
presence. It was not only that there was
withdrawn from debate the greatest Par-
liamentary orator of the century. With
his departure the House of Commons suf-
fered loss of a note of dignity, a colour-
ing of lofty character, which remain irre-
parable. Happily, the normal tone of per-
sonal conduct in the House of Commons
is high. Anything mean, unworthy the
character of an English gentleman, any
tendency to tamper with the truth,

swiftly, angrily resented. Beyond and
above that ordinary condition there was
a something magnificently, though simply,
lofty in Mr. GLADSTONE'S moral attitude.
His strength was as the strength often
Because his heart was pure.
He had a manner of old-fashioned
courtesy that was contagious in fashioning
debate. His subtle influence for good in
these respects was, up to the last, far-
reaching. When he sat on the Front
Bench on either side of the SPEAKER'S
chair, he was as a loadstone, concentrating
upon himself all regards. It was natural
enough that strangers in the gallery, pay-
ing a rare visit, should turn to feast their
eyes upon Mr. GLADSTONE. That was a
touch of nature that made them kin with
Members who saw him every day. If he
stood up to speak, he of course engrossed
attention. His distinction was that, when
lie sat as a listener, he was, in most cases,
more closely the object of regard than
.lir man speaking. Members watched
of this or that just said, and whether
there was probability of his being dragged
into the debate. Once on his legs the
brooding meditation bubbled into excite-
ment. From first to last, however far off
the last might be, he held the attention of
the House, charming it with his eloquence,
even where he could not convince it by
his argument.
The fascination he had for the House ot
Commons it wielded over him. When the
time for separation came, it was as hard to
think of him wending his way through
daily life without spending some houri in
the Commons as it was for the House
to conceive itself upstanding with this
prop withdrawn. It was an unpre-
meditated thing that he never re-entered
the House after his historic speech, when
he flung down what I'IUNCK ARTHUR de-
scribed as "a declaration of war against
the ancient constitution of these realms."
Perhaps he feared its potent spell. Having
deliberately resolved to retire from Par-
any suspicion of dishonest intent, is>
liamentary life, he felt it wiser not to
him keenly, wondering what he thought

subject himself to the temptation of even
an hour's return to the old familiar scene.
He could not forget how, just twenty years
earlier, having, in consideration of "my
time of life." arrived at the conclusion
that he would do best to spend what re-
mained in retirement, he retraced his
steps. I remember well, how, in the Ses-
sion of 1875, within a month or two of
his letter to Lord GRANVILLE confirming
his resignation of the Leadership of
the Liberal party, he began furtively
to look in at Westminster. It was
characteristic of his unconsciously dra-
matic tendencies that he dressed the
part of a man who had no personal
concern with what was going forward.
Whilst leading the House up to the
close of the Session of 1873—as when,
later, he resumed his position—he made
a practice of leaving his hat in his private
room, a habit which led to a memorable
scene in the Parliament of 1880. When
in the Session of 1875 he occasionally
looked in, he brought with him not only
his hat, which he Itept on when seated,
but his overcoat, his walking-stick, even
his gloves. What were Parliament or
and after forty-two years of laborious
public life," voluntarily withdrawn from
the scene? A casual wayfarer passing
down Parliament Street, seeing the gate-
way of Palace Yard open, he had just
dropped in, and, above all things, hoped he
didn't intrude.
At the time of his second retirement,
the weight of twenty years was added
to the burden of his prodigious labours.
His mind was as bright, his intellect as
keen, as ever. But the flesh truly was
weak. So he came not any more, and the
House of Commons is poorer through all
time to come by the loss of his illumi-
nating presence.

THE SCHOLAR-FARMER.

culture at Oxford hosbven rejected.—Daily 1'uper.]
OXFORD ! of whom the poet said
That one of your unwritten laws is
To back the weaker side and wed
Your gallant heart to wobbling causes;
It is with mute surprise and pain
I mark a breach of old tradition;
I hear you will not entertain
The Ploughman's plea for recognition!
It cannot be that you have gone,
Like old Prometheus' private vulture,
And prematurely sat upon
The rallying corpse of Agriculture!
You, on whose nicely watered plains
Where'er the rural student trips, he
Is sure to notice some remains
Suggestive of the Scholar-Gipsy;
Ford of the Ox! whose ancient name
Is full of fine bucolic feeling,
How could you thus ignore his claim,
The learned farmer's, lowly kneeling?
He spoke of ensilage and germs,
Of fallow land and pigs in clover;
You answered in derisive terms,
And lightly passed his Georgics over.
He proffered butter-churns; he knew
The patent cream-extractor's odd use;
He tested milk; but you, you threw
Cold water on his dairy produce.
He wove for you a Cereal crown,
And craved in turn an Honours title;
You knocked his cornucopia down,
And gave him beans for cold requital!
Oh, Oxford! in your hours of ease
Content to spurn the newer knowledge!
What if the foot-and-mouth disease
Should hit you hard in court and college?
What if, through pestilence or drought,
You failed for very lack of victuals,
While all your prophets, driven out,
Made Cambridge flow with beer and
skittles?

destination tired out. Glad to get to bed.
Tuesday.—Up with the lark. Did the sights. Had no time to
look at anything, as I had to attend to the tickets. Saw all the
museums. My party coming out when I had got the catalogues.
So managed our visits that there was no opportunity of dis-

sleep to food. Went to bed.
Wednesday.—Up with the lark. Off again travelling. On the
road all day. Having to fit in the corresponding trains, had no
leisure for meals. Arrived at our new resting-place late at night.
So off as quickly as possible to bed.
Thursday.—Up with the lark. Spent the morning in sight-
seeing under the customary conditions. Waited upon the family.
Looked after the catalogues and umbrellas. Food again at a
discount. Dispensed with dinner. Glad to get to bed.
Friday.—Up with the lark. Time to return. Back again by
a train. No food. No rest. Half-way home. Arrived in time
to see the lights being put out. Off to bed.
Saturday.—Up with the lark. Continued my journey post-
haste. Wrote up my diary. Find that I have got over several
hundreds of miles; but for the life of me cannot remember any-

OPERATIC NOTES.
Royal Birthday Night, May 21.—For
Die Meistersinger house crowded with
worshipping Wagnerites. The minority
delighted but overpowered, as is the
fate of minorities. With the Brothers DE
HKSZKK, PLANCON, PRINOLE (which for the
look of the thing should he spelt "Prin-
gel"), SotJLACRorx, and EMMA EAMES in
one cast, with Conductor MANCINELLI in
the chair, the most exacting Wagnerite
could not wish for more, and will never
again be satisfied with less.
Wednesday.—La Favorita ought always
to be the opera par excellence for Derby
Night. But as the place of the favourite
was taken by Jeddah at Epmom, so Faust
walked in at Covent Garden. SUZANNE
ADAMS came out an a charming Marguerite,
with a lover Van Dyck Faust not quite
up to the mark. It is satisfactory in this
cas1/ that VAN DYCK should first appear
as an old master. VAN DYCK good in the
trio. Poor Mile. BATTERMEIBTER as Mar-
tha, for the first time these many years,
suddenly gave in and fainted. The curtain
lowered; much sympathy; considerable
excitement; then, on the curtain being
raised, every one delighted to see Mile.
BAUERMEISTER, the suffering Martha, ten-
derly supported by EDOUARD DE RESZKE,
who, as the designing Mephistopheles, was
infernally kind to her. And so, with his
support, Martha managed to get through
her share of the opera.
Thursday.— BOITO'S Meftstofelt. Awk-
ward way of spelling Mephistnpheles, when
one has to substitute "f" twice for the
accustomed "ph." Much the same as it
we came to spell physician "fysician,"
and to take "fysic." Madame CALVE,
doubling the parts of Marguerite, "with
the golden hair a-hanging down her back,"
so as to make a strong contrast between
"the fair one with the polden locks" and
» dark-haired HELEN of Troy, with no-
thing classical about her but the name.
But what matters the hair, if we only eet
the music? And not only the music, but
al.io such actine os that with which
Madame CM.VE delighted a crowded house.
Monsieur BONNARD as Faust, "If, Fnnnard
JP, rf^m,...." T"i<zhtv pood, and PLANCON
a fine fiend. MANCTNELLI meritorious.

nerian Cyclists ino'iirinir when the Cycle is

Cvcle dnv* and nights breakfasts, lun-
cheons, dinners, tens and suppers will be

that is what that well-informed person,

medallion-tablet affixed by CHARLES KEAN

KBAN, on the wall of the parish church of
St. Mary Magdalene, Richmond, Surrey,
is rapidly wasting away. The great actor's

SKENBAIOITS !—Two emissaries from the
office of The Cantab were deputed to inter-
view Mrs. KENDAL during her recent visit
to Cambridge. The report of these two
interviewers—neither dared go alone—is
published in the ab< ve-mentioned Univer-
sity journal. It is excellent and instructive
reading, and should pend up the paper's
sale to an enormous extent. Mrs. K EN DA L
permitted the interviewers to approach her.
Here was her mistake. Anyone positively
objecting to be interviewed should not
admit such unprincipled villains, as the
lady's unfortunate experience of journa-
lists shows them to be, into her presence.
And apparently she was alone! The un-
protected female in the presence of two
steel pens, and capable of anything!" I

And as for editors — they are the most

added, "and sold," but she didn't—"and

positive of the truth of your assertion, you

INSPIRED by his theme, The Millionaires (HCTOHINBON), Mr.
FRANKFORT MOORE has lavished on the work glittering strands
of wit. His dialogue, unbrokenly brilliant, does not tire because
it seems so easily done. My Baronite would advise the gentle
reader to take a sheet of foolscap and attempt to imitate it. The
scenes are chiefly set on the snores of the Mediterranean, the
gay life of the English-American colony being reproduced with a
pleasant tincture of acidity. Mr. MOORE'S most life-like people
are his Irish and his Americans. Lord Ballyseedy is delightful,
and is with characteristic undutifulness outdone by hia niece
Angela. The understanding between the two distinctly varies
from that established in ordinary avuncular relations.
FLORENCE WARDEN has written many a better novel than this

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
BEFORE THE PUBLIC AMUSEMENT COMMITTEE.
THE inquiry into the proceedings of A .Runaway Girl at the
Gaiety Theatre took place to-day in this Court.
Miss KLI.ALINK TKRRIHH (Mrs. SKTMOUB HICKS) said that oi
course she was bound to like her part very much. It was so
new and fresh. She played an ingenue. For the fint time t Oh,
dear, not Why, she was always playing an ingenue. Being
asked if ever before this she had sung a love-song with the lime-
light on her, accompanied by a "chorus without/' Miss TBRBISS
replied that she rather thought so. Unable to explain why there
was nothing strikingly dramatic for her to do, or remarkably
original for her to sing, in this piece, but she wished the Com-
mittee to understand that the piece was not written by Mr.
HICKS alone. If it had been written All for Her, why, then
(Applause, during which witness smiled sweetly, curtsied, and
withdrew.)
Mr. Louis BKADFIELD, who addressed his replies to the Com-
mittee in a light and airy manner, said. Am I the Gaiety jeunf
premier f Why, certainly. Style founded on FBED LESLIE and
HICKS, with a touch of ABTHUB ROBEBTS? Well, if you say so,
good, but not aware of it myself. Consider a touch-an'-go
jaunty manner, a high-coloured make-up, and a light, summer;
costume, varied by suddenly earnest sentimentality, with occa-
sional wink, or a demurely sly expression, a useful voice, a
capable pair of legs for step-dancing, the qualifications for "a
Gaiety young man." In present part of Ouy Stanley—(by the
way, he objected to being called a Guy)—he had not much to do
or sing. Should probably work it up. Stand down? With
pleasure. Ta, ta! See you later.
Mr. HARRY NICHOLLS, who spoke in a rather low tone, and did
not seem quite at his ease, said he was an old hand at stage busi-
ness. Knew it all. Other people copied him, yes. Why shouldn't
he copy others, and try his hand at writing a new musical play r
Not alone. Oh, no. In conjunction with SEYMOUR HICKS. Did
not see him in Court. Sorry. Hicks ilia laerymce. Collaboration
excellent; ahem—oh I yes—might have got on better without
collaborateur. Did they speak his dialogue on the stage t He
hoped so, but couldn't say. In fact, couldn't recollect exactly
what his dialogue was. Could swear some dialogue had been
written. With SEYMOUR HICKS? Oh, yes, but Well, he
would rather not say any more on the subject. Forgot whether
he had ever seen Fra THavolo, or played in The Thum^ting
Legacy. Was sure he hadn't played in The Chieftain. _ Might
have seen it. Could not say he remembered the Courier in that
Opera, or the Courier's song. Perhaps Mr. SEYMOUR HICKS did.
Did they intend this to be a genuine comic opera? Certainly,
emphatically—that is—they commenced with that idea,—but—-
somehow—couldn't explain how—probably—eh ?—oh I yes—in the
course of rehearsals—it gradually became a—a—in fact, a " Gaiety
Piece." Good-day. (Here the witness nodded pleasantly to the
Committee, find stepped down.)
Mr. Punch's own critic being called, said he agreed with last
witness. The piece began with the promise of genuine Fra Dia-
voloish comic Opera, but the promise was not "kept to the ear."
Was it light, bright, and amusing? Certainly it was. Every-
body seemed to have an equal chance of making his or her part
stand out from the rest, and Miss KM,AI.INP, TBRRISS, Miss F.-THKI.
HAYDON. Messrs. EDMUND PAYNE and FRED KATE took
every advantage of the numerous opportunities thus offered.
As to the story, that, as Mr. Toots had remarked, was "of_no
consequence." Quite sympathised with the troubles and trials
of authors and of Mr. GEORGE EDWABDES in their gallant attempt
to make a cake all plums. EDMUND PAYNE was inimitable, and
FRED KATE as natural as if he were in a comedy, except when
he suddenly remembered that he was in an extravaganza.
Mr. GEOROE EDWARDES, in reply to severe] questions, said, he
considered this new piece much the same as its predecessors. It
opened well,—yes—and there was certainly a promise of light
comic opera in it. For his part, he should prefer genuine comic

was saying a good deal.—a good deal more, in fact, than the parts
have to say for themselves. As a title, "A Runaway" might not
be quite appropriate; he hoped she had "come to stay." If the

INSPIRED by his theme, The Millionaires (HUTCHINSON), Mr.
FRANKFORT MOORE has lavished on the work glittering strands
of wit. His dialogue, unbrokenly brilliant, does not tire because
it seems BO easily done. My Baronite would advise the gentle
reader to take a sheet of foolscap and attempt to imitate it. The
scenes are chiefly set on the shores of the Mediterranean, the
gay life of the English-American colony being reproduced with a
pleasant tincture of acidity. Mr. MOORE'S most life-like people
are his Irish and his Americans. Lord Sallyfeedy is delightful,
and is with characteristic undutifulness outdone by his niece
Angela. The understanding between the two distinctly varies
from that established in ordinary avuncular relations.
FLORENCE WARDEN has written many a better novel than this
Little Hits Prim (F. V. WHITE & Co.). It will serve to
beguile a leisure hour, or several leisure hours, according to "the

small doses. It excites, but disappoints.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BEFOEE THE PUBLIC AMUSEMENT COMMITTEE.
THE inquiry into the proceedings of A Runaway Girl at the
Gaiety Theatre took place to-day in this Court.
Miss ELLALINE TF.HKISH (Mrs. SEYMOUR HICKS) said that ol
course she was bound to like her part very much. It was so
new and fresh. She played an ingenue. For the first tuna? Oh,
dear, not Why, she was always playing an imjfnur. Being
asked if ever before this she had sung a love-song with the lime-
light on her, accompanied by a "chorus without. Miss TBRRIBS
replied that she rather thought so. Unable to explain why there
was nothing strikingly dramatic for her to do, or remarkably
original for her to sing, in this piece, but she wished the Com-
mittee to understand that the piece was not written by Mr.
HICKS alone. If it had been written All for Her, why, then
(Applause, during which witness tmiled sweetly, curtsied, and
withdrew.)
Mr. Louis HRAWIEI.D, who addressed liis replies to the Com-
mittee in a light and airy manner, said. Am I the Gaiety jeune
premier? Why, certainly. Style founded on Vnv.it LESLIE and
HICKS, with a touch of ABTHTTB ROBERTS? Well, if you say so,
good, but not aware of it myself. Consider a touch-an'-go
jaunty manner, a high-coloured make-up, and a light, summery
costume, varied by suddenly earnest sentimentality, with occa-
sional wink, or a demurely sly expression, a useful voice, a
capable pair of legs for step-dancing, the qualifications for "a
Gaiety young man." In present part of Guy Stanley—(by the
way, he objected to being called a Guy)—he had not much to do
or sing. Should probably work it up. Stand down? With
pleasure. Ta, tal See you later.
Mr. HARRY NICHOLAS, who spoke in a rather low tone, and did
not seem quite at his ease, said he was an old hand at stage busi-
ness. Knew it all. Other people copied him, yes. Why shouldn't
he copy others, and try his hand at writing a new musical play '•
Not alone. Oh, no. In conjunction with SEYMOUR HICKS. Did
not see him in Court. Sorry. Hicks ittce lacrymce. Collaboration
excellent; ahem—oh! yes—might have got on better without
oollaborateur. Did they speak his dialogue on the stage P He
hoped so, but couldn't gay. In fact, couldn't recollect exactly
what his dialogue was. Could swear some dialogue had been
written. With SEYMOUR HICKS P Oh, yes, but—— Well, he
would rather not say any more on the subject._ Forgot whether
he had ever seen Fro THavoln, or played in The Thumping
Legacy. Was sure he hadn't played in The Chieftain. Might
have seen it. Could not say he remembered the Courier in that
Onera, or the Courier's song. Perhaps Mr. SEYMOUR HICKB did.
Did they intend this to be a genuine comic opera P Certainly,
emphatically—that is—they commenced with that idea,—but—
somehow—couldn't explain how—probably—eh P—oh ! yes—in the
course of rehearsals—it gradually became a—a—in fact, a " Gaiety
Piece." Good-day. (Here the witness nodded pleasantly to the
Cnmmittee, find stepped down.)
Mr. Punch's own critic being called, said he agreed with last
witness. The piece began with the promise of genuine Fra Dia-
voloish comic Opera, but the promise was not "kept to the ear."
Was it light, bright, and amusing? Certainly it was. Every-
body seemed to have an equal chance of making his or her part
stand out from the rest, and Miss ELLALINE TRRRISS, Miss FTIIKI.
HAYDON. Messrs. EDMUND PAYNE and FRED KATE took
every advantage of the numerous opportunities thus offered.
As to the story, that, as Mr. Toots had remarked, was "of no
consequence." Quite sympathised with the troubles and trials
of authors and of Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES in their gallant attempt,
t-o make a cake all plums. EDMUND PAYNE wan inimitable, and
FRED KATE as natural tut if he were in a comedy, except when
he suddenly remembered that he was in an extravaganza.
Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES, in reply to several questions, said, he
considered this new piece much the same as its predecessors. 1>
opened well,—yes—and there was certainly a promise of light
comic opera in it. For his part, he should prefer genuine comic
opera. He wasn't so idiotic as to try and educate the public:
he always let the public educate him. Then got what they
wanted, and therefore he got what he wanted. Would he express
any opinion as to the merits of A Runaway Girl? Yes, he
would, with pleasure, when A Runaicav Girl had finished her
run; not before. There were narts in it for everybody, which
was saying a good deal.—a good deal more, in fact, than the parts
have to say for themselves. As a title, "A 'Runaway" might not
be quite appropriate; he hoped she had "come to stay." If the

A NEW TERROR FOR CELEBRITIES. PORTRAITS BY WIRE.
[According to the Daily Mail it ia possible to transmit portraits by wire.]

EXPERIMENTS IN TELAUTOGRAPHY BY A BEGINNER.
DARBY JONES REFLECTS ON EPSOM AND
MANCHESTER.
HONOURED SIK,—When, on Wednesday
last, a coach laden not only with copious
Hampers, but also a very Hilarious Party,
halted at the Doomed Code of Sutton, not
one of that Jovial Band opined that the
return journey would be undertaken, by
Myself, at all events, under most depress-
ing auspices. Count GROGONOFP (titular
King of Cracow) quaffed the life-inspirinp
B. and S. with Captain KRITERION, and
vowed eternal friendship; Sir WILLOTGHBY
BINKO (who has assumed a Baronetcy dor-
mant for Two Centuries) drank his fa-
vourite beverage, champagne and stout
commingled, from a silver goblet which
had once figured in the Palatial Hall
of EVANS'S, and shared his morning
draught with BEN FRONT, the cele-
brated cueist; while I But why
pursue the subject P Briefly, the Universal
Toast, Tory in its assimilation, was
"Derby and Disraeli!" It would be of
no interest, Sir, to you or to my other
honoured patrons to relate how, imme-
diately afterwards, a slight difference of
opinion (always allowabk among Gentle-
men) arose between the Captain and the
Baronet as to the Joint Wagers incurred
by them in supporting the Favourite for
some Young Dear Friends of theirs. Suf-
fice it to say that the Count cast oil on
the waters of speculation by exclaiming,
"Ve vill cot your mooes up between us!"
Peace then reigned, and self-compla-
cency was established when we took up a
commanding position on the Chalk-it-up
Hill. Several of mv companions pointed
out that on the Hill the Sportsman was
relieved from those Coarse Importunities
to which he might be subjected by Layers
of Odds in the Licensed Enclosures round
about the Grand Stand. Moreover, the
Dreadful Welcher would be avoided. Cap-
tain KRITERION, who is a Bit of a Bard
(indeed, he backed The Bard in A.D. 1886,
and was prevented from settling by Family
Grief) was most, humane on the subject,
and wrote an "Innompteu" (as he termed
it), on the back of Mr. DORLINO'S Correct
Card, to the detriment of the advertise-
ments. I took a cony of thi» Districh. and
knowing that you sip at Pierian Springs,
I venture to reproduce his not inelegant
Quatrain:
"Some good in vilest humankind I own.
Nor even at the Welcher cart a stone;
For, when with eager eye his place I scan
After the race, he is a non-est man!"
RION. "Dere certainly spoke ze man of
experience that does it."
Of what moment to detail such com-
parative Trivialities as the victory of Mr.
BARNATO (every one glad to see the Old
Colours over a new skipper), or the Fasci-
nation which Mr. ARTHUR JAMES had foi
backers in the Stanley Stakes, or the
Wandering Minstrels who live on Lobster
Claws and Disabled Pineapples, and othei
Indigestible Refuse of the good and great.
or the Ladies and Gentlemen of all and
Indescribable Degrees who bring the scent
of Monte Carlo over the Surrey Downs.
Luncheon-time passed in Sybaritic Fa-
shion, save that numerous Females of the
Gipsy Persuasion continuously dirtied im
nether Sartorial Requisites by the appli-
cation of their thumbs and forefingers to
the calf of my right leg, in the hope of
Filthy Lucre for Indifferent Soothsaying.
Of course, we had the usual Sweepstake.'
over the Great Event, at Five Pounds per
rapitem, my juvenile acquaintance, the
Hon. GEORGE FLIFI^TT, late of Oxford
College, who providentially appeared on
the scene, kindly providing my Quantum
Rwff., which otherwise I could not have
found, being at a loss for change. The
Count held the hat, and KRITERION drew
the numbers. The former was lucky
enough to secure Disraeli, and the other
the Duke of DEVONSHIRE'S representative.
I found myself credited with Wuvern.
while FT.IFT.ATT obtained >eirnn, which, by
a singular belief in his starting, had been
included in the Lottery.
Hern I nause to draw breath, as did
Countless Thousands when they saw a Dis-
repnted Outsider called .Trddah, named.
T believe, after a disreputable Port on the
Red Sea (it ought to be called Dead Sea),
romp home in front of one uf my Strong
Tins, the foot-flitting J)att, at the extra-
ordinary odds of 100 to 1 against. Thp
success of Mr. LARNACH'S colt was hailed
with a low moan bv all on our Dismal
Drag, save and excepting KRITERION, who,
having also drawn "the Field," which in-
cluded the Arabian, ouietly slipped the
whole of Our Sweep into his capacious
pockets. The Count alone gave a cynical
smile, while regarding this heartrending
operation. For myself. I felt non plii-i.
So, borrowing FT.HTVTT'S ticket, I made
tracks for the Paddock, where, if you
remember, my chief. I met you in com-
nany with a most- Cheerful and Affable
Companion. Sir FRAIBER PTJNNISTT, of

EXPERIMENTS IN TELAUTOGRAPHY BY A BEGINNER.
DARBY JONES REFLECTS ON EPSOM AND
MANCHESTER.
HONOURED SIR,—When, on Wednesday
last, a coach laden not only with copious
Hampers, but also a very Hilarious Party,
halted at the Doomed Cock of Sutton, not
one of that Jovial Band opined that the
return journey would be undertaken, by
Myself, at all events, under most depress-
ing auspices. Count GROQONOFF (titular
King or Cracow) quaffed the life-inspirinp
B. and S. with Captain KRITERION, and
vowed eternal friendship; Sir WILLOTJOHBY
BINKO (who has assumed a Baronetcy dor-
mant for Two Centuries) drank his fa-
vourite beverage, champagne and stout
commingled, from a silver goblet which
had once figured in the Palatial Hall
of EVANS'S, and shared his morning
draught with BEN FRONT, the cele-
brated cueist; while I But why
pursue the subject? Briefly, the Universal
Toast, Tory in its assimilation, was
"Derby and Disraeli!" It would be of
no interest, Sir, to you or to my other
honoured patrons to relate how, imme-
diately afterwards, a slight difference of
opinion (always allowable among Gentle-
men) arose between the Captain and the
Baronet as to the Joint Wagers incurred
by them in supporting the Favourite for
some Young Dear Friends of theirs. Suf-
fice it to say that the Count cast oil on
the waters of speculation by exclaiming,
"Ve vill cot your moo^s up between us!"
Peace then reigned, and self-compla-
cency was established when we took up a
commanding position on the Chalk-it-up
Hill. Several of mv companions pointed
out that on the Hill the Sportsman was
relieved from those Coarse Importunities
fco which he might be subjected by Layers
of Odds in the Licensed Enclosures round
about the Grand Stand. Moreover, the
Dreadful Welcher would be avoided. Cap-
tain KRITERION, who is a Bit of a Bard
(indeed, he backed The Sard in A.D. 1886,
and was prevented from settling by Family
Grief) was most humane on the subject,
and wrote an "Innompteu" (as he termed
it), on the back of Mr. DORLING'S Correct
Card, to the detriment of the advertise-
ments. I took a copy of thit Districh. and
knowing that you sip at Pierian Springs,
I venture to reproduce his not inelegant
Quatrain:
"Some good in vilwt humankind I own.
Nor even at the Welcher cart a stone;
For, when with eager eye his place I scan
After the race, he is a non-est man!"
RION. "Dere certainly spoke ze man of
experience that does it."
Of what moment to detail such com-
parative Trivialities as the victory of Mr.
BARNATO (every one glad to see the Old
Colours over a new skipper), or the Fasci-
nation which Mr. Annum JAMES had foi
backers in the Stanley Stakes, or the
Wandering Minstrels who live on Lobster
Claws and Disabled Pineapples, and othei
Indigestible Refuse of the good and great,
or the Ladies and Gentlemen of all and
Indescribable Degrees who bring the scent
of Monte Carlo over the Surrey Downs.
Luncheon-time passed in Sybaritic Fa-
shion, save that numerous Females of the
Gipsy Persuasion continuously dirtied mi
nether Sartorial Requisites by the appli-
cation of their thumbs and forefingers to
the calf of my right leg, in the hope of
Filthy Lucre for Indifferent Soothsaying.
Of course, we had the usual Sweepstake;
over the Great Event, at Five Pounds per
rtipitem, my juvenile acquaintance, the
Hon. GBOROE FLIFLATT, late of Oxford
College, who providentially appeared on
the scene, kindly providing my Quantum
iSui/f., which otherwise I could iiot have
found, being at a loas for change. The
Count held the hat, and KRITERION drew
the numbers. The former was lucky
enough to secure Disraeli, and the other
the Duke of DEVONSHIRE'S representative.
T found myself credited with Wiretrn.
while Ft.iFi.ATT obtained )ernn, which, by
a singular belief in his starting, had been
included in the Lottery.
Hern I nause to draw breath, as did
Countless Thousands when they saw a Dis-
reonted Outsider called Jeddnh, named.
I believe, after a disreputable Port on the
Red Sea (it ought to be called Dead Sea),
romp hom« in front of one uf my Strong
Tins, the fust-flitting Batf, at the extra-
ordinary odds of 100 to 1 against. The
success of Mr. LARNACH'S colt was hailed
with a low moan bv all on our Dismal
Drag, save and excepting KRITERION, who,
having also drawn "the Field," which in-
cluded the Arabian, ouietly slipped the
whole of Our Sweep into his capacious
pockets. The Count alone gave a cynical
smile, while regarding this heartrending
operation. For myself. I felt non phi*.
So, borrowing FT.IFT.ATT'S ticket, I made
tracks for the Paddock, where, if you
remember, my chief, I met you in com-
pany with a most- Cheerful and Affable
Companion, Sir FBAISER PUNWCTT, of
Wncrutaff Hall. Salop, whose crest I find
in DEBRETT'S Record of thf Nobility to be
"on an arm sinister a double strawberry
priceless gift considering the war), cheer-
fully observed, "Well, I'm sorry the Duke
didn't quite hit it off with his bat, but he
didn't score battly after all. Dunlop
couldn't stay the course, as he was pro-
bably tyred. Regarding the winner, he
ought to have been fathered by a centu-
rion, not a Janissary, and though there
was a MADDEN in the saddle, there are,
I expect, a great many more mad'uns on
the Course."
I could see by his jovial remarks that
you and Sir FRASIER PUNNETT had backed
"Jeddah," and I felt cut to the quick

quitting your bracing society so abruptly,

especially just now, when at the London

so is his Shopman at the stores, where '' eggs

masterly analysis of the old song, " Where
are you going to, my pretty Maid t" and his
admirably high-toned moral reflections on
the conduct of the gentleman—shall we
call him "gentleman?"—we think not,
as no gentleman who considers himself a
gentleman could possibly stoop (and he
must have stooped, as he was on horseback,
when speaking to a girl afoot) to address a
young and simple maiden going with
buckets to the " bucket-shop" (apparently,
and this is the only excuse for the other-
wise rude questioner), and ask her " Where
she was going," and to style her, "My
pretty maid." But wot she "hit pretty
maid?" Now, on this point—but at this
point we must break off, and leave the
difficult question to be solved by Professor
I UNiKi.r LKNO, who will find in this old song
matter for infinite discussion, and illimitable
theories to be dealt with in his own inimi-
table manner. Every Laughing Philo-
sopher should hear DAS LKITO'S discourse.
There are other attractions—all good.

Low WESTCOTT or a High WESTOOTT?

Hong Kong; graceful concession of Gib-
raltar; polite withdrawal from the Cape.
2. Write full account of forthcoming en-

EXTHACTBD I KiiM THB Hi tin OP TOBY, M.I'.
House of Commons, Monday, May 23.—
At a quarter past six, the Right lion.
J. W. LOWTHER took the Chair on re-
sumption of Committee on Irish Local
Government Bill. Particular about men-
tioning him in full style, as this is earliest
opportunity. Naturally expected to find
his name in list of Jubilee honours. Per-
haps is more distinguished out of the crowd
in the briefer Birthday List. However
it be, Privy C'ouncillorship is well deserved.
From the first, J. W. took to the Chair ot
Ways and Means as a duck takes to water.
Cannot recall an instance where he has
blundered. As the ever-regretted Mr.
PH.KLPS, sometime American Minister at
this Court, once said, a man who never
makes a mistake will never make any-
thing. Still, in either Chair of House
of Commons, even monotonous freedom
from error is regarded in a favourable
aspect.
True, J. W. has lived through Elysian
days compared with the lot of his pre-
decessor. That kindly, courtly gentleman
never had justice done to him. He came
fresh to Chair at an epoch exceeding in
bitterness any that has marked the Com-
mons since early Corn Law days. More-
over, an able and influential circle of the
Opposition made a dead set against him.
Wanting to wreck the Home Kule Bill,
in the Chairman. If they could worry him,
and get things in a muddle, the chances

"As u clui'k takes to wa^er."
of Bill passing were appreciably lessened.
So they deliberately and systematically
"went tor" the Chairman.
J. W. lives in happier times. At best,
position ot Chairman ot \\ ays and Meaua
is a difficult one to sustain with general
approval. That approval the present in-
cumbent early won, and holds with in-
creasing firmness of grip.
Nothing more toucuing than the grati-
fication of his kinsman, Lord of the Isle
of Thanet, at the official recognition of
the Chairman's success. "We LOWTHERB
are getting on," JEMMY said, smiling be-
nignly at the Chair. "There is not one

inadequate, so much the worse for the Bill.

for Whitsun holidays. Been sitting since
noon yesterday , for the most part dolefully
dull; hour after hour in Committee on

SIR,—At this momentous crisis, when
the fortunes of two great nations are trem-
bling in the balance, it is disgusting to find
that there are some unhappy creatures
so blinded by their sordid love of gold as
to allude to petty financial transactions in
their conversation and correspondence.
Only this morning I received a letter from
Messrs. SNIPS <fc Co., tailors, "begging my
attention to their small account." Small
account, indeed I I have explained in my
reply that my whole attention, at the pre-
sent time, is concentrated elsewhere—
somewhere in the neighbourhood of Cuba,
in fact. Yours faithfully, M. P. KUNIUS.
SIR,—In common with all other men of
intelligence, you must be aware how dis-
gracefully the fleets of America and Spain
alike have been mismanaged in the present
war. Since my retirement from the sugar
trade, which took place a few months ago,
I have devoted much attention to the pro-
blems of naval warfare. And, being a
lover of fairplaVj I beg to intimate that for
a moderate fee I am prepared to furnish
either Spain or the United States with a
plan of campaign which cannot fail to
prove immediately successful.

I have several valuable invention*, which

Your policy we seem to cross,
We tamper with your best allies,
Find profit in your loss.
When fresh advantages we seek
With crafty smile we speak you fair,
And laugh, at first with tongue in cheek—
Outright when once we 're there.
So when at last our true intent,
No longer hidden, you discern,
Our double-dealing you resent—
A worm, they say, will turn.
Yet know, as angrily you squirm
And dare remonstrate when attacked,
We look upon your turning, worm,
As an unfriendly act.

[" An important wnr causes literature and art to
be neglected. ... It is curious to notice how it is
the one topic of conversation at the dinner-table, in
the train, and elsewhere."—A Weekly Bcview.]
SIR,—At this momentous crisis, when
the fortunes of two great nations are trem-
bling in the balance, it is disgusting to find
that there are some unhappy creatures
so blinded by their sordid love of gold as
to allude to petty financial transactions in
their conversation and correspondence.
Only this morning I received a letter from
Messrs. SNIPS & Co., tailors, "begging my
attention to their small account." Small
account, indeed 1 I have explained in my
reply that my whole attention, at the pre-
sent time, is concentrated elsewhere—
somewhere in the neighbourhood of Cuba,
in fact. Yours faithfully, M. P. KUNIUS.
SIB,—In common with all other men of
intelligence, you must be aware how dis-
gracefully the fleets of America and Spain
alike have been mismanaged in the present
war. Since my retirement from the sugar
trade, which took place a few months ago,
I have devoted much attention to the pro-
blems of naval warfare. And, being a
lover of fairplay, I beg to intimate that for
a moderate fee I am prepared to furnish
either Spain or the United States with a
plan of campaign which cannot fail to
prove immediately successful.
HORATIO NELSON TOMKINS.
SIR, — Our country is watching the
struggle with "trembling eagerness." And
what does this lead to? It leads to Sleep?
lessness, to Indigestion, to a Disordered
Liver,—in a word, to all those ailments for
which Poppleton's Perfect Pillules are the
cne safe and infallible cure. The moral is
obvious. POPPLETON & Co.
SIR,—Owing to this abominable war, I
can find no sale for my usual Spring out-
put; my Odes to the Cuckoo are a drug
in the market; no editor will look at my
Sonys to May. And so, Sir, 1 appeal to
you to assist me by announcing that I
am prepared to furnish Patriotic Songs,
Ballads and Elegies (with American or
Spanish flavour, according to taste) on the
lowest terms. APOLLO JOHNSON.
P.S. (private and confidential).—What
do you say to running my Strife of Nations

sand lines—as a serial in Punch t
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I have been shame-
fully treated, and I appeal to you for pro-
tection. That old beast BILLY (our head-
master, you know) put me on in Caesar
this morning. I didn't know a word of it,
and explained that I couldn't be expected
to trouble about Latin and Greek and that
sort of rot, when all my sympathy was
absorbed in the fate of Spain. And the only
result, if you please, was that BILLY told
me to write out the lesson twice, Latin
and English! Yours disgustedly,
Bito,, . 3/inor.
MARS MELIORIS BELLI INVENTOR.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—As I know that you
are strictly neutral, and that your esteemed
publication is read alike in Castile and
Washington State, I beg to draw the
attention of the high-contending Powers
of Spain and America to the fact that
I have several valuable inventions, which
should certainly be immediately adopted
by one or both of them.
1. A Machine for Making Dynamite
Bread, which cannot be distinguished from
the ordinary Staff of Life. Invaluable for
provisioning an Enemy's fleet under the
cover of disinterested friendship.
2. A Submarine Balloon disguised as a
Whale, Shark, or Sword-fish, according to
taste, propelled by centrifugal force, and
heavily charged with a destructive liquid,
of which I am sole patentee.
3. A Repeating Cannon made of papier
•mache, so light that it can easily be carried
in the breast-pock«t of a military-cloak.
4. A Mirror fitted with 3,000,000-power
electric light, calculated to blind 30,000
men at first sight. Priceless, unless the foe
wear my Rontgen Ray Protective spectacles.
5. A Marine Cycle, which, by a special
power of oil-diffusion, can travel safely
through the stormiest sea.
6. My Refrigerator Splendens, whereby
a whole division can be frozen into immo-
bility by the turning of a handle.
I trust that some at leait of my methods
may meet with your approval. At all
times am I ready to furnish plans, &c.,
to you or any oilier cuj/italiet.

"A CUBE FOR INDOLENCE."
HAVE just been reading in the Fort-
nightly an article •with this title. Being
naturally indolent, I take an interest in the
subject. Even continue to do so after
reading this article, translated from the
French into remarkable English. It ie
probably good for "an indolent," as the
translator would call me, to have his brain
taxed occasionally. At last discover the
correct treatment. Somehow I do not seem
quite a proper subject. Enjoy excellent
health. Nevertheless, am hopelessly lazy.
Must therefore regulate the employment of
the twenty-four hours as recommended by
the French doctor, though, as the translator
puts it, "without doubt one will judge
these precautions juvenile even to the
burlesque, tyrannical even to the
absurd." Doii't quite know whether the
translator would consider me an absurd.
Perhaps I am a burlesque. Will begin to-
morrow, and carefully follow Dr. DE

"Eise at seven." Rather uncomfortably
early. Generally get up at nine. But
persevere. Next comes " intellectual work
tor about an hour and a half," and then
breakfast at half-past eight. Don't quite
see what time this leaves for bath and
dressing. Ah, yes! Intellectual work
mu^t go on meanwhile. Do my best.

absurd." Don't quite know whether the
translator would consider me an absurd.
Perhaps I am a burlesque. Will begin to-
morrow, and carefully follow Dr. DE
F.LErjRY'8 programme for the day.
"Eise at seven." Rather uncomfortably
early. Generally get up at nine. But
persevere. Next comes " intellectual work
for about an hour and a half," and then
breakfast at half-past eight. Don't quite
see what time this leaves for bath and
dressing. Ah, yes! Intellectual work
mui-t go on meanwhile. Do my best.
Repeat the easier end of the multiplication
table while having my bath—alwaye hated
mathematics—and conjugate amo after.
Not so easy. Schoolboy's mechanical
memory clean gone. Part my hair all
crorksdly while struggling with the
wreuheri verb. Still sometime for intel-
lectual work. Begin to hate it. Head
some irregular verbs in my old Latin
grammar. Very uninteresting. At last
breakfast time. Excellent appetite. What
next!' Hang it all! More "intellectual
work." Had thought of doing some verses
for a magazine. Evidently impossible.
Must try something intellectual. Trans-
late part of the Fortnightly article back
into French. Easy enough, anyhow.
Then comes "rest at half-past eleven."
Should much prefer some exercise. How
am I to rest? Can't go to sleep in the
morning. Even I am not so indolent as
that. Besides, the next thing is lunch at
noon. HJW delightfully foreign. Always
orefer dtjeuner. But after a solid English
breakfast it ia rather early. So tafce that
rest in a cab to the Savoy. Dfjmner there.
Don't seem very active so far. What
now? Another rest 1 In cab to the club,
and rest to ere in easy chair with my eyes
shut. Still rather indolent. Then comes
"a walk." At last I But only for about
half-an-hour. After this, I am to follow
my "ordinary occupations." Evidently
must not work or walk, write or read. So
drop into club again, sit in easy chair, and
soon fall asleep. Just as I wake, SMITH
comes in. "Hullo," he says, " taking it
easy, as usual?" "Not at all," I retort,
'• I m curing my indolence. You'll see
the system described in the Fortnightly."
"Oh, indeed," he replies, "I'm glad the
care is working so well." Begin to have
doubts of it myself. But will persevere,
fhould like a uttle exercise. This is not

"PHEW! JUST SAVED IT BY T' SKIN o' MY TRBTH!"
"Dinner at seven." What now P "Rest
tor half-an-hour." Again! This is awful!
Fall asleep once more. Wake just before
mlf-past eight. At last " a short walk,"
and then "go to bed." Probably a mile
is short enough. Do this, and get into
bed as the clock strikes nine. I may have
been indolent, but I have never been to bed
so early since I was at schooL Impossible
to sleep. Would welcome "intellectual
work" as a distraction. But dare not even
repeat the multiplication table to myself.
At last, at daybreak, can bear it no longer.
Set up, dress, and walk to Richmond.
Shall give up this cure. Hather than

"WHY VEGETARIAN?"
(Sff Arti'Je in "Xincltfntli Century " far June.)
MY DEAR SIR HENRY THOMPSON,—You are not a vegetarian.
ISot a bit of it. There were many heresies of old, and the Arian
was one of the chief. Nowadays, it is the Veget-Arian who is
really quite outside your Orthodox Rules and Regulations for
* ood and Feeding. Your "reply to critics" in the Nineteenth
Crntiiry is most excellent, and knocks on the head the jzarbler
who rearranges your remarks to suit his quotations. Sir HENRY,
you are honoured. What writings are those which the enemy of
mankind quotes to suit his own purpose? I do not pause for a
reply. Such a critic of your work is, to apply an Ibsenian title
to him, a "Headrrle.ix Garbler." When your works, Sir HENRY,
.shall be collected in an "octaro," your advice will be found in-
valuable for all time, all ages, and all appetites, and youi
'' menus" will be to all sensible persons "menus plaisirs."
Do I know any one man who is purely and simply (very simply)
a vegetarian? Let me consider. I know a Latin professor, who
says he lives on "Ter-nips per diem." Lives! Nay, he exists.
And for how long? Some style themselves "vegetarians" be-
cause they won't walk, and say that they have arrived at that
time of lire which may be styled a "Cab age." Another I know
is followed over the sheep-fields bv a canine companion, termed
by him, "the Collie Flower of the "Flock." The diner who never
lias more than one friend to share his meal, calls himself a " Tater-
Tater," but I question whether he limits himself and companion
to this vegetable. Another, a traveller, who saya he never
wanders into unknown paths, professes therefore to be always
living on "beat routes." This is far-fetched, but as I said, he is
a traveller, and just arrivsd from a very long way off.
You, Sir HENRY, are right. You always are right, whether
you are aware of it or not. And those who follow your advice will
insure for themselves a beautiful present (when their birthday
comes round) and a still happier future with a cheerful retrospect,
This summed up means " Contentment," the result of good diges-
tion. So, Sir HENRY, "a votre santt!"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. LE GALLIENNE'S Romance of Zion Chapel (JOHN LANE),
despite the vicious weakness of its hero and its second heroine, is
a touching story of earthly love, excused by hopelessly false senti-
ment, and brought to its logical conclusion by a pagan mode of
death. The picture of the broken-hearted girl dying of "a great
shock" is genuinely pathetic. One of the two essential situa-
tions seems as if inspired by a subtle reminiscence of the won-
derful forest scene in ZOLA'S La Favte de I'Abbf Mnvret. Mr. LR
GALLIENNE is a writer "with incumbrances." These "incum-
brances " are his affected mannerisms which, when he has settled
down to his work, and is going straight ahead with his story,
and " going strong" too, he casts to the winds as imprilimfnta,
and we wish that he would never retrace his steps to pick them
up at his leisure. "RICHARD is himself again " only when he be-
comes desperately in earnest.
The Daif.het Diamonds (WARD, LOCK & Co.), by RICHARD
MARSH, is a high-pressure express pace novel, whose hero, a
somewhat unprincipled young man, gets into a serious diffi-
culty as wilfully as did the man who, being "wondrous wise,
jumped into a quickset hedge and scratched out both his eyes,"
and who, with much the same tact and impulsive energy as was
exhibited by the hero of the immortal nursery rhyme, proceeds
to get himself out of the difficulty with satisfaction to his friends,
to the girl of his heart, and to the absorbed reader. Decidedly,
read it!
Scribes and P/ion'sccs, by WILLIAM LE QUEUX (F. V. WHITE
A Co.). Cleverly-told storv of Bohemian life in Paris and
London. Just a flavour of Trilby in the earliest portion. The
tli'noument leaves it a trifle uncertain as to the actual guilt of
the accessory before the fact, but though the murder is at the
beginning, the mystery about it is preserved to the very end.

Pietermaritzbura (vr, P.J/.Burp, fur short),
April 23, 1898.
( DEAR MR. PUNCH,—We liave flitted at length into the " Garden
Colony," and struck a really nice place in the capital with the
above polysyllabic name. Some of the inhabitants, I believe,
call it Sleepy Hollow," and the Zulu designation is "IJmgun-
gunhlovu," a pretty little series of gurgles and clicks, which they
tell me means "Home of the Elephant." Please ask KIUKU
HAGGARD if this is correct. Nearly every name begins in a ten-
tative way with Urn- . The river here calls itself the Umsin-
dusi, and there are the Umgeni, Umgababa, Umkomaas, and so
forth, in the neighbourhood, and for all one knows, Umslopogaas
may be the name of your ricksha-boy.
These latter products of Natal swarm in the streets. They
are mostly clad in a sort of bathing costume, and are not of a
high order of intelligence. It is useless giving them any direc-
tion, as they trot along like a horse, bloving with a peculiar
whistle when winded. If you want to go to the right, you say
the Kaffir for "the hand you eat with," to the left "the hand
you forget with" (which seems rather a Hibernicism); when
you wish to stop, "Hlalagahla" (hasten slowly) does the trick,
if you can manage to pronounce it. It sounds like shlahlugashla,
shillelaghghastly, or something of the sort.
Ladysmith, where we stopped on the way from Johannes-
burg, is not a particularly lively place, though it is called the
Aldershot of South Africa. The native police there are asto-
nishing objects. They have two or three knobkerries, a gum
ring round their heads, a salt-spoon or tooth-brush, or some
other etcetera, thrust through their ears, their beards twisted
into five or six very thin spikes, and bare legs and feet. We
looked in at a murder trial in the court. The evidence, given
through an interpreter, seemed to turn on the question as to
whether the deceased was killed after he was dead, or vice versa.
Anyhow, the process of cross-examination was so tedious that
one of the defendants went to sleep, and had to be prodded up by
the aforesaid guardians of the peace. To slumber unconcernedly
while your own life is at stake seems the height of indifference,
but it is characteristic of the Kaffir.
The railway from Ladysmith is one of the corkscrewiest in
existence—so much so that it serves many passengers as a sea
or three chains and down gradients of 1 in 30. We found it,
however, a pleasant drive down the mountain heights on to the
well-woodea plain, in the centre of which lies PJVi.Burg. The
feathery branches of the wattles and the blue-gum leaves brush
the train windows as you burrow through the verdant tunnels.
To-morrow to visit an old rascal of a native chief in his kraal,
and then on to Durban, which is tha beginning of India.

shall be collected in an "nctarn," your advice will be found in-
valuable for all time, all ages, and all appetites, and youi
"menus" will be to all sensible persons "menus plaisirs."
Do I know any one man who is purely and simply (very simply)
a vegetarian? Let me consider. I know a Latin professor, who
says he lives on "Ter-nips per diem." Lives! Nay, he exists.
And for how long? Some style themselves "vegetarians" be-
cause they won't walk, and say that they have arrived at that
time of life which may be styled a "Cab age." Another I know
is followed over the sheep-fields by a canine companion, termed
by him, "the Collie Flower of the Flock." The diner who never
has more than one friend to share his meal, calls himself a " Tater-
Tater," but I question whether he limits himself and companion
to this vegetable. Another, a traveller, who says he never
wanders into unknown paths, professes therefore to be always
living on "beat routes." This is far-fetched, but as I said, he is
a traveller, and just arrived from a very long way off.
You, Sir HENRY, are right. You always are right, whether
you are aware of it or not. And those who follow your advice will
insure for themselves a beautiful present (when their birthday
comes round) and a still happier future with a cheerful retrospect.
This summed up means " Contentment," the result of good diges-
tion. So, Sir HENRY, "a votre sante!"

MR. LE GALLIENNE'S Romance nf Zistn Chapel (JOHN LANK),
despite the vicious weakness of its hero and its second heroine, is
a touching story of earthly love, excused by hopelessly false senti-
ment, and brought to its logical conclusion by a pagan mode of
death. The picture of the broken-hearted girl dying of "a great
shock" is genuinely pathetic. One of the two essential situa-
tions seems as if inspired by a subtle reminiscence of the won-
derful forest scene in ZOLA'R La Fa-utc de VAbbf Mourct. Mr. LK
GALLIENNE is a writer "with incumbrances." These "incum-
brances " are his affected mannerisms which, when he has settled
down to his work, and is going straight ahead with his story,
and "going strong" too, he casts to the winds as impedimenta,
and we wish that he would never retrace his steps to pick them
up at his leisure. "RICHARD is himself again " only when he be-
comes desperately in earnest.
The Datrhet Diamonds (WARD, LOCK & Co.), by RICHARD

somewhat unprincipled young man, gets into a serious diffi-
culty as wilfully as did the man who, being "wondrous wise,
jumped into a quickset hedge and scratched out both his eyes,"
and who, with much the same tact and impulsive energy as was
exhibited by the hero of the immortal nursery rhyme, proceeds
to get himself out of the difficulty with satisfaction to his friends,
to the girl of his heart, and to the absorbed reader. Decidedly,
read it!

are mostly clad in a sort of bathing costume, and are not of a
high order of intelligence. It is useless giving them any direc-
tion, as they trot along like a horse, bloving with a peculiar
whistle when winded. If you want to go to the right, you say
the Kaffir for "the hand you eat with," to the left "the hand
you forget with" (which seems rather a Hibernicism); when
you wish to stop, "Hlalagahla" (hasten, slowly) does the trick,
if you can manage to pronounce it. It sounds like shlahlagashla,
shillelaghghastly. or something of the sort.
Ladysmith, where we stopped on the way from Johannes-
burg, is not a particularly lively place, though it is called the
Aldershot of South Africa. The native police there are asto-
nishing objects. They have two or three knobkerries, a gum
ring round their heads, a suit-spoon or tooth-brush, or some
other etcetera, thrust through their ears, their beards twisted
into five or six very thin spikes, and bare legs and feet. \Ve

Tuesday.—While the Cyclists, the Professional Wagnerian

:aught the encore as it was dropping, and M. RENAUD did his
Toreadorest with what power he has at his disposal; but, as a

in pale blue and pink, and was in every way charming. Miss
Utflissima BAUERMEisTEH-«inger, as one of the naughty gipsy
girls, quite all right again, whereat audience delighted. As to
the chorus-cum-dancine in last act, steps should be taken for its
improvement. Calve has discarded the black glittering dress she
used to wear "once upon a time," as now she sports orange
velvet. How quaintly she dresses her hair in flat bandeaux, too!
M. BONNARD did his level best as Don Jose, the infirm-of-purpose
young man, and in the last act, got a bit above himself, dra-
matically.
Wednesday.—Welcome, MOZART! Le Nnzze di Figaro, with
aristocratic Madame EAHES quite perfect as the Countess; Madame
DE LUSSAN good as ever in the part of the cheeky Cherubino,
the Italian Buttons; while Madame NORDICA, as Susanna, gave us
a missis-piece, which, we suppose, is the feminine of masterpiece,
and if not, it ought to be. M. EDOUARD DE RESZKB was indis-
posed (weather very trying for throats just now), and so M.
DCFRICHK was elevated to the rank of Count for the occasion.
His sudden, accession to the ranks of the Italian aristocracy was
perhaps just a little too much for him, if the tremolo in his
voice may be taken as indicating nervousness. Harpsichord and
piano assisted in orchestra, piano giving his old friend a lead,
and putting him right when slightly in error. M. RAXDBOGER,
conducting, seemed pleased, and Miss BADERMEIBTER excellent as
MarceHina, a wonderful transformation I
scholarly critic of the Daily Telegraph wrote, "Madame EAMES
was in admirable voice" ("Hear! hear!" from ourselves), "and
there were not a few present who would gladly have heard her
repeat 'Dove Sono.'" Most of us would have been considerably
astonished had Madame KAMKS, as the Countess, sung "Dove
Sono" even once; but what would have been the feelings of
Madame NORDICA, in whose part, that of Susanna, the song
"Dove Sono" occurs! Wouldn't Madame NOHDICA have been
justified in quoting with indignation the very words of the song,
the translation of which is worth producing : —
"Heav'ns! Where am I! Whut presumption!
Have you ar'u—but hence, away!"
And the bold Countess, who has neither part nor parcel in that
particular scene, would have had to retreat before the face of
the justifiably irritated waiting woman, who would not have
waited any longer. But such lapsus calami will occasionally
happen in the criticisms of the best regulated pen-masters.

I LOVE you in an all absorbing, fond, unselfish way,
I dream of you the long night thro', I think of you each day,
Whene'er I hear your voice, my dear, a spell o'er me is cast,
The rapture of your presence is (I 'm certain) bound to last.

With riches of an earthly kind I am more loth to part,

You '11 find the verses published in our local magazine.

A SUGGESTION.—Everybody who knows
anything about the Show at Earl's Court,
is familiar with the pleasant "Welcome
Club" so conveniently situated in the
gardens of the Exhibition. The "Wel-
come Club" is a good title, so suggestive
of hospitality to guests. Now, as there are
many excellent persons who, for some
reason or other, or, for no reason in par-
ticular, are unable to become members of
the Athenwum, the Marlborough. the
St. James's, the Jockey, the Turf, the
Reform, the Garrick, Constitutional, and
other clubs too numerous to mention, and
who may have been vigorously, but of
course most unjustly, pilled at almost all
the best clubs in London, would it not be
eminently useful and advantageous to
start the "Vn welcome Club," open to
every "Unwelcomer" in whose faces all
other London clubs had closed their doors?
It would not be very difficult to name a
President, likewise to nominate a Com-
mittee, for this club. Yearly subscriptions
should be paid in. advance, and the en-
trance fee should be considerable.

girls, quite all right again, whereat audience delighted. As to
the chorus-cum-dancing in last act, steps should be taken for its
improvement. Calve1 has discarded the black glittering dress she
used to wear "once upon a time," as now she sports orange
velvet. How quaintly she dresses her hair in flat bandeaux, too I
M. BONNARD did his level best as Don Jose, the infirm-of-purpose
young man, and in the last act, got a bit above himself, dra-
matically.
Wednesday.—Welcome, MOZART! Le Nozze di Figaro, with
aristocratic Madame EAMES quite perfect as the Countess; Madame
DE LTTBSAN good as ever in the part of the cheeky Cherubim),
the Italian Buttons; while Madame NORDICA, as Susanna, gave us
a missis-piece, which, we suppose, is the feminine of masterpiece,
and if not, it ought to be. M. EDOUARD DE RESZKE was indis-
posed (weather very trying for throats just now), and so M.
DUFRICHB was elevated to the rank of Count for the occasion.
His sudden accession to the ranks of the Italian aristocracy was
perhaps just a little too much for him, if the tremolo in his
voice may be taken as indicating nervousness. Harpsichord and
piano assisted in orchestra, piano giving his old friend a lead,
and putting him right when slightly in error. M. RANDBOOER,
conducting, seemed pleased, and Miss BAFKHMKISTEK excellent as
Harcellina, a wonderful transformation!
By the way, in his next morning's notice of the Nozze, the
scholarly critic of the Daily Telegraph wrote, "Madame EAMES
was in admirable voice" ("Hear! hear!" from ourselves), "and
there were not a few present who would gladly have heard her
repeat 'Dove Sono.'" Most of us would have been considerably
astonished had Madame EAMKS, as the Countess, sung "Dove
Sono" even once; but what would have been the feelings of
Madame NORDICA, in whose part, that of Susanna, the song
"Dove Sono" occurs I Wouldn't Madame NORDICA have been
justified in quoting with indignation the very words of the song,
the translation of which is worth producing: —
"Heav'na! Where am I! What presumption!
Have you ar'u—but hence, away!"
And the bold Countess, who has neither part nor parcel in that
particular scene, would have had to retreat before the face of
the justifiably irritated waiting woman, who would not have
waited any longer. But such lapsus calami will occasionally
happen in the criticisms of the best regulated pen-masters.
Rest, and refreshing ourselves for the Great Cycling Wag-
nerian Show.
THE FIN DE SIECLE SUITOR.
I LOVE you in an all absorbing, fond, unselfish way,
I dream of you the long night thro', I think of you each day,
Whene'er I hear your voice, my dear, a spell o'er me is cast,
The rapture of your presence is (I 'm certain) bound to last.
On you I '11 pour the loving store and treasures of my heart,
With riches of an earthly kind I am more loth to part,
I '11 sing your praise in loving lays, for are you not my queen?
You '11 find the verses published in our local magazine.
So deep is my affection I would joyfully propose,
But for one great objection, which now I will disclose,
Intense is your suspense, so I '11 endeavour to be shoit,
The fact is, that a husband you 're not able to support.

"PRIVATE ATKINS," said the C. O., "I
congratulate you upon leading that forlorn
hope so successfully."
"I merely did my duty, Sir," was the
respectful reply.
No, no," returned the Colonel, "you
are too modest. To scale a parapet, spike

"Any one of my company, Sir, would
have done the same."
"I doubt it. Your bravery was heroism

"I cannot afford it."

A SUGGESTION.—Everybody who knows
anything about the Show at Earl's Court,
is familiar with the pleasant "Welcome
Club" so conveniently situated in the
gardens of the Exhibition. The "Wel-
come Club" is a good title, so suggestive
of hospitality to guests. Now, as there are
many excellent persons who, for some
reason or other, or, for no reason in par-
ticular, are unable to become members of
the Athenaeum, the Marlboro ugh, the
St. James's, the Jockey, the Turf, the
Reform, the Garrick, Constitutional, and
other clubs too numerous to mention, and
who may have been vigorously, but of
course most unjustly, pilled at almost all
the best clubs in London, would it not be
eminently useful and advantageous to
start the "TJuwelcome Club," open to
every "Unwelcomer" in whose faces all
other London clubs had closed their doors P
It would not be very difficult to name a
President, likewise to nominate a Com-
mittee, for this club. Yearly subscriptions
should be paid in advance, and the en-
trance fee should be considerable.
Ars est Celare Artem.
OP Art they say the highest kind

And this, no doubt, is why we find
So very few reveal it.

parties meet in what my Book calls "an open district," with
pleasant view of building in dispute. Scenery trembles as the
two F's come on in the guise of a couple of Zoo-bears, one Arctic
and the other black, with nice natural climbing-poles. If fault
can be found with them it is their knees, which show weakness in
descending staircase through boulders. Follows noisy alterca-
tion, with now and then something faintly suggestive of an air;
Presently enter referee, in jaunty person of Loge, wearing
scarlet livery of Mephisto: a most eligible premier loge, enjoying
uninterrupted view of this and other situations. Suggests
that he could put Wotan into good thing in gold mines, dividends
of which might compensate Messrs. Fafner and Fasolt for
moral damage. Wotan much tickled at notion of getting inside
market Ring. As Book puts it, with quiet humour: —
"The hoop to hnve with me
Hold I wholly for wisdom."
Adjournment to Underground. Here Alberich has got a
specimen of Rheingold crushings on leading finger. Also
Nibelung midgets have built him a hat, which he calls a
Tarn-Helm. What he can do with the tarn thing is shewn
when Loge and Wotan step into his Inferno, trying not
to look more like VIRGIL and DANTE than they can help.
First he goes behind property rock, turns on steam, and comes
out as the best prehistoric dragon I have ever seen outside pages
of Punch. Goes jabberwoking off to right wing in jerky coils,
a triumph of stage-management; then comes back smiling and
blushing as Herr NEBE. Mephistophelian cunning of jeune premier
Loge now revealed in following dialogue, given here in the rough
from memory, without alliteration :—
Aiberieh (after quick change from dragon). Not bad, was it?
Loge. Very fine and large. Suppose you couldn't have done it on a mailer
scile? Alb. Why, certainly.
Loge. Couldn't turn into a toad, could you? Alt. Of course I could.
Loge. Wnat, a little one? Alb. Small as you like.
Loge. Saiall enough to go through a key-hole? Alb. Rather; you see.
Puts on hat and goes behind another property-rock. Steam as
before. Loge (who wouldn't hit a dragon his own size) is on to
toad like knife; and Alberich, on resuming own shape, finds his
arms pinioned with piece of coarse string.
To make prodigiously long story short, his whole hoard, in-
cluding hoop, has to go to pay bill or release. Entire col-
lection has, nowever; to be handed over to Messrs. Fafner and
Fafolt in consideratu
THE ACIDITY OF THE GRAPE.

dim religious pew just as voluntary opens.
Curtain rises on vertical section of Rhine. How management
keeps noble river from getting over footlights I cannot think.
Nor how these three nymphs sing so beautifully under ^ water
without swallowing any of it. Nor yet how they go on Wagala-
weia-ing, as Woglinde calls it, for about twenty minutes at same
angle without moving legs. Have seen shows at Royal Aquarium,
but nothing to compare with this.
Forget how many feet of water Rhine-steamers draw;
but
think large pointed rock in centre of river-bed must be very dan-
gerous. Management thinks so too, and puts a little beacon on
ft. This attracts attention of Alberich, who goes up crag in
small hydraulic lift and helps himself to Rheingold. Refer to
Book of Words for his motive, which, I am told, is kit. My
translation (by a Mr. FORMAN), said to be "in the alliterative

Wednesday, 5 P.M.—Dif, Walkiire. Never saw a man so tired
as Siegmund (late Loge) when he calls at Hunding's country-
seat after a hard dav with the hounds. Took something under
five minutes to walk from the front door to the sofa; chest
going in and out like a concertina. A drink, that takes almost
as long (my Book of Words calls it "a well," but there is no
Truth in this), picks him up at last; and his long-lost twin
sister, Mrs. Hunding, sings to him as sweetly as any bird I

Presently host arrives in great voice. He was Fasolt on
Monday. Said at the time that Fafner didn't really kill him.
They sit down to supper, but don't touch it. as things are rather
strained, Hvnding having frankly promised to shoot Siegmund
early next morning after a hospitable night's rest. Wife, how-
ever, drugs his posset so well that he hears nothing of a lovely
loud duet that the twins sing in the dining-room.
Meanwhile, twins arrange to elope, being encouraged by view of
a Spring-night with gentle-waving scenery seen through an exceed-
ingly large pair of folding-doors in wall. "In the Spring a young

ordinary muscular effort, large sword from out of trunk of central
ash-tree, piece of furniture which was then dc riaueur in the best

bring tree away with it.
A very perfect scene, marred only by inevitable defects of
music's qualities. Will freely admit that WAGNER as poet
has better chance against WAONER as composer than any other
librettist ever gets. But drama goes desperately slow. Every
action, from vulgar processes of drinking or panting, to passion-

take their time from the orchestra. And do what Herr MOTTL will

As for VAN DTCK, though his motions are a little spasmodic, and

Hvnding, will have bad quarter-of-an-hour with Wotan when he

When the god appears, magnificent in war-paint and singing
divinely, he dismisses the rest of the Valkyries so as to have a

two F'B come on in the guise of a couple of Zoo-bears, one Arctic
and the other black, with nice natural climbing-poles. If fault
can be found with them it is their knees, which snow weakness in
descending staircase through boulders. Follows noisy alterca-
tion, with now and then something faintly suggestive of an air.
Presently enter referee, in jaunty person of Loge, wearing
scarlet livery of Mephisto: a most eligible premier logs, enjoying
uninterrupted view of this and other situations. Suggests
that he could put Wotan into good thing in gold mines, dividends
of which might compensate Messrs. Fafner and Fasolt for

Loge. Couldn't turn into a toad, could you? Alb. Of course I could.
Loge. TVnat, a little one? Alb. Small as you like.

Puts on hat and goes behind another property-rock. Steam as
before. Loge (who wouldn't hit a dragon nis own size) is on to
toad like knife; and Alberich, on resuming own shape, finds his
arms pinioned with piece of coarse string.
To make prodigiously long story short, his whole hoard, in-

DEAR MR. PTTNOH,—Please, I'd like to
tell you about a piec« of hard luck I 've
had lately. The other day, I was dragged
by my eldest toror (which I will translate
freely, for the benefit of the unlearned,
as "sister ") to see one of the mater's lady
friends, who is afflicted with a she-baby.
the creature caught sight of me, and actu-
ally dared to smile at me. Of course my
soror went mad over the thing; that I
didn't mind, I only pitied her. But, not
content with speaking a lot of idiotic rub-
bish to it, brutally told roe to kiss it.
Naturally, I said I wouldn't. When we
got home, she hadn't forgotten (no such
luck), but told the muter, who knagged
me, not only for refusing to kiss it, but
even for not volunteering to sit on the
ground and play with it. I am thirteen,
you know. I 've written to you in the
hopes that it will catch the eye of some
influential person, who will take the strong
measures required for abolishing this kind
of annoyance. (Excuse my interrupting,
but I must draw your attention to this
last sentence, I think I put it rather
neatly.) I asked the mater if I could rely
on its not happening again, but she got
quite angry. I only hope she doesn't see
this letter; I shall have to hide away your
paper this week. Yours in haste,

hearts; once more their Husbands, Bro-

'DARBY MONES. DISCOURSES ON ASCOT.
HONOURED SIR,—Once more the Thau-
matrope of Time brings ufi afresh to the
dainty delights of Aristocratic Ascot; once
more every Noble Lady in the land is
endeavouring to discover with what frills
and furbelows other Noble Ladies are
going to delight the Eye of Man and
cause Bitter Envy to surge in feminine
hearts; once more their Husbands, Bro-
thers, Cousins, SonSj Nephews, Fathers,
Uncles, and Adorers in general, are won-
dering what the week's dissipation is likely
to cost them, when dresses, drags, hired
houses, champagne lunches, and specula-
tion on Horseflesh have to be settled for,
while Poverty-stricken Plungers, who
shudder at the mere name of Epsom do-
ings, are searching for Good Things with
all the assiduity of diggers and delvers in
far Klondyke.
For my own part, honoured Sir, not
being one of the Favourites of Fortune,
being without Landed Estates. Money
in the Funds, or Negotiable Jewellery,
—well,—suffice it to say that I never
miss the Royal Meeting, and I think
I may observe, without the Blush of
Egotism mantling my cheek, that my
Get-up on such occasions is one that does
not disgrace you, honoured Sir, or any
other of my esteemed Patrician Patrons.
As Count GROGANOFF observed the year
before last (I got him to write down the
phrase), "SHONES a toujours I'air d'un
Che.valifT d'Induitrie dtguist en Prince,"
which, I am told, means in British verna-
cular, "JONES always looks like a Noble-
man in Disguise."
We have taken a Cosy Crib not a hun-
dred miles from the Course, where, I need
not say, we shall be Proud to entertain
our Friends to the best of our humble
Resources, and also ask them to join us
in some harmless Post-prandial Games. I
only hope that we shall not fall victims
to such a Scurvy Trick as was played us
in a year which shall be dateless. Captain
KRITKII KIN had, with his usual forethought,
hired a snug and respectable villa belong-
ing; to the Widow of a Venerable Arch-
deacon, and had also taken care that many
cases of the Best, together with much
thither from certain London Purveyors in
whom he had every confidence, and they
in him. But when we sat down to our
evening repast at nine o'clock, lo, and
behold! there was no bread. The Beast
of a Village Baker had actually refused to
supply us with the Staff of Life.
It appeared that, on a previous occasion,
KRITBRION, after giving this Flower Spoiler
profuse patronage, had somehow or another
omitted to settle his paltry account, and
this was the Inhuman Caitiff's pitiful
revenge!
There were we, seated at a table over-
laden with Luxuries, and not a crumb or
crust of common Household Sustenance,
no shops open in the neighbourhood, and
no inn nearer than five miles off. A
supply of biscuits had, alas! miscarried,
and we had to consume seed cake with our
priceless Gorgonzola, Camembert and Brie.
I quiver with Indignation and Indiges-
tion as I recall this disgraceful episode.
Away with such a sickening recollection!
Let me seek relief in the Muse. Let her

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Here we are, in a place whose name re-
minds one of home, and whose leading thoroughfare is called
Oxford Street, though I can't trace any other points of resem-
blance. Both this harbour and Durban are provided with very
fine bars, the result being that big liners have to lie outside.
We were therefore shipped yesterday from the latter port on
board the "Dunvegan Castle" by means of a basket over the
side of a tug, and felt like a lot of cattle as we were swung in
mid-air.
A few days ago we rode and drove out to a kraal in Natal, to
pay our respects to a chief, whose name sounded somewhat like
COCKIELEEKJE." When we got there, we found that our induna
was out on a wife-hunting expedition, in search of his thirty-first
spouse. However, the existing thirty Mesdaraes COCKIELEEXIE
and their progeny were all there, and we left a card on the
senior chiertaineas, who was squatting on all fours inside a hut.
She treated it with contempt, not unmingled with aversion. It
was doubtless a fearful breach of etiquette.
We were soon surrounded by a swarm of importunate children
nnd grass-widows, with bead ornaments and Kafir drinking-
bowls, etc., to sell. As we could get them much cheaper in
London, we declined their offers, but invited a few of the least
unprepossessing ladies, with brick-red and bottle-shaped coiffures,
and babies on their backa, to pose for a family group. They
named their terms with the air of professional beauties, and,
after much haggling, a bargain was struck. When the photo was
taken, some twenty others sprang like magic from the ground
and declared they had been included in the group, and demanded
their fees as well. I wonder they did not raise the question of
copyright. Anyhow, the leader of our party, who could vitu-
perate in Zulu with the best of them, found his work cut out
in pacifying our hostesses. He was saved from being torn to
pieces by the arrival of the induna himself attended by his
umbrella-bearer. He soon sent his thirty better, or noisier halves
about their business. We said "we saw him," which was no
poker parlance, but the Zulu greeting, and hoped "our" kraal
would "dwell happily," and took our leave. Six hours later we
got rid of the last of the Natal grasa-ticks which infested his

EXTRACTED raoM THK DIARY or TOBT, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday night, June
6. — If one has to bint at a fault in the
manner of the Member for Oxford Univer-
sity, it is a tendency to frivolity. Consti-
tutionally prone to see the bright, not to
say the comic, side of things, his light-
heartedness sometimes jars on tne sensitive
mind. This made the more striking the
evidence of emotion betrayed when the
SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE to-night came
forward as Champion of the Clergy. Their
case had been laid before adamantine CHAN-
CELLOR OP EXCHEQUER by Colonel MIL-
WARD. That gallant Member, amazed at
the moderation of hi-, own fluency, urged
that parsons whose income is wholly or in
part derived from tithes, should have a
little special provision made for them out
of public purse. As SQUIRE OF MAI. WOOD
(uncommonly active after recess) pointed
out, present Government passed Act
largely endowing landlords out of the rates.
Why should clergy, also drawing their in-
come from land, be omitted from beneficent
arrangement P
ST. MICHAEL said that, out of respect
to the memory of the late Queen ELIZA-
BETH, it couldn't, be done. Since the
time of that lamented monarch, clergy
had been taxed on present system. Would
never do to alter it. Above all things, no
scandal about Queen ELIZABETH.
Convinced by this argument, J. G. TAL-
BOT rose, and with tears in his voice ad-
vised MILWARD to withdraw his amend-
ment moved on second reading of Budget
Bill. The Colonel, having thoroughly
enjoyed himself with his speech, and feel-
ing that he had done all that was possible
for downtrodden clergy, assented. Friends
of the clergy on Ministerial side gave sigh
of relief. Everything going off admirably.
Had made their plaint; had pleased their
parish parson; but 'twould never do to
vote against the Government, above all in
a division where their names would figure
in the list as backing up fresh demand on
public purse in favour of what ruthless
persons opposite called the richest church
in the world.
It was here SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE
(lately removed to Old Palace Yard) inter-
posed. Not usually regarded as a buttress
of the Church. Is content with living aa
near Westminster Abbey as building ar-
"Help the Poor Clergy " and then running
away touched his chivalrous soul. If hon.
and almost reverend gentlemen opposite
would not divide the House on the ques-
tion, he would. So, pressing MADDISON
into service as co-teller, the two ultra-
Radicals led put the hower of British
Toryism, to strike a blow for the oppressed
parson.
In point of size it wasn't much of a
flower, and it seemed to form itself a little
reluctantly. But the thing was done, and
tears of genuine emotion rolled down
cheeks of J. G. TALBOT as he went out
with the dauntless twenty-seven.
"None of us are hopelessly bad," he
said. "Nothing is irretrievable. 1 begin
to think I shall live to see LABBY endowing
5, Old Palace Yard, as a Home for
Incurable Curates, himself, in decent garb,
presiding at their matins and evensong."
Business done.—Proposal to extend to
clergy Relief of Landlords Act defeated
by 215 votes against '27.
Tuesday.—HARK just now lost in con-
templation of the problem why, in Par-
liamentary debate, a certain type of states-
man and orator should attacn himself to
India and its far-reaching atfairs. Here
is a country whose extent, whose popula-
tion, whose material wealth, whose ancient
history, whose barbaric splendour inflame
the imagination, touch the profoundest
depths of human intellect. It is a theme
that has fitly engaged the oratory of Fox,
BURKE and SHERIDAN, the pen of MA-
CAULAY, the sword of CLIVE and WARREN
HASTINGS. Yet, as sure as ever India
comes on for discussion in the House of
Commons, SAM SMITH and Sir WILLIAM
WEDDERBURN take the floor.
'Twaa ever thus, before and since the
time of the late Sir GEORGE BALFOUR.
Wherefore? That is just what the Member
for Sark wants to know. Secret up to the
present is past finding out. PRINCE AR-
THUR and BON JOSE, listening to GEORGIE
HAMILTON'S statement on Indian finance,
found the problem so entrancing that they

IN The Admiral (HTJTCHINSON), Mr. DOUGLAS SLADEN has
woven a wreath to the memory of NELSON in anticipation of
the hundredth anniversary of the battle of the Nile, fought
on the 1st of August, 1798. He calls it A Romance, and lives
up to the idea by introducing, by way of undercurrent, the story
of the love of a British midshipman for a Sicilian Princess. The
book is really a careful study of the personality, private life, and
glorious career, of NELSON. It is a perilous undertaking, and my
Baronite congratulates Mr. SLADEN on his success. It has evi-
dently been a labour of love. He has not only steeped himself
in all known records of the great Admiral, especially his letters and
despatches, but has visited the scene of his amours with Lady
HAMII.TON, and describes them with graphic force. Next to
NELSON, ROMNEY'S model stands out on the page with most dis-
tinctness. The manly Queen of Naples, and her futile husband,
with occasional glimpses of the complaisant Sir WILLIAM HAMIL-
TON, give varied life to the picture. Nothing yet done in litera-
ture presents a more vivid picture of NELSON. In some of the
aspects it is startling regarded through the glasses in use at the
end of the Nineteenth Century. But it is necessarily accurate,
since Mr. SLADEN'S so-called Romance is largely made up, whether
in dialogue or description, of the actual words of NELSON and his
contemporaries.
Burdett's Official Intelligence (SPOTTISWOODB <fe Co.), has
reached its seventeenth year—a sweet young thing of 2,528 pages,
weighing a trifle under a stone. It is almost a providential thing
that Sir HENRY BURDETT, its Editor and creator, having retired
from his secretarial office on the Stock Exchange, should have
decided to withdraw from further care of this monumental work.
It has been growing year by year till it has reached cubical pro-
portions quite as extensive as an able-bodied man can grapple
with. The mass of information given is at first sight bewilder-
ing in its range and complexity. But so admirable is the work-
manship, so masterly the arrangement, that any one swking in-
formation upon a particular point has no difficulty in finding it.
Indispensable to all having dealings with the Stock Exchange, it
recommends itself to my Baronite on the ground that, in case of
emergency, it will serve admirably as a centre table for an office
or a stool tor any desk of ordinary height. THE B. UK B.-W.

"VERY COLD \\'INI> TO-DAY, MRS. TUBES.
"YES, SIR, IT is. BUT IT SUITS ME—IT'S so EMBRACING!"
"OUTINGS."
SAYS the Daily Telegraph, June 15, "In France, Germany,
Holland, and Switzerland, the comfort of the English tourist is
to be studied as it has never been studied before." Time is
money. Save time, you save money. Say a minute equals a
sovereign; i.e., sixty pounds per hour. By the night service, per
Bale, Berne, and Coire, we are to save five hours. That is,
taking the above estimate, a saving of three hundred pounds
in one journey. Then, having done so much for the traveller,
the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company works an-
other wonder, for, between Switzerland and Victoria "it abolishes
night!" No necessity to go to the land of the Aurora Borealis
for a lengthy day: all you nave to do is, come home from Switzer-
land, and, en route, there is no night!
But, for a short trip that will cheer the worn and weary
Londoner, there is a 4.20 from Calais, which will reach the
latter at 7.45 (or, may be, a trifle earlier), when, if you
have no luggage, and are of a decided character, you will have
about twenty-five minutes clear for snack-and-whistle-wetter, a
small cup of coffee, and then cigar, pipe, or cigarette in mouth,
you can depart rejoicing by the 8.25 boot, and will arrive
(L. C. & "D. V.") at Victoria by 11.40 of the clock, so that in
twenty minutes, should your residence be handy, you may be
tucked up in your own little cot and enjoying "that repose,
which innocence, virtue," and the tired traveller, "only knows."
The S. E. Co. is going on the same lines, so to speak, or, at all
events, similar ones, as, says the D. T., jubilantly (the writer of
that article evidently enjoys the idea of getting away for a
holiday, and revels in the facilities for doing so), the Weary
Worker can start from Charing Cross at 2.45, snnck, nay, almost
"dine," but that 's a big word, at Boulogne about 7, and start to
return to his Pona'es and Lares (whom he leaves at home, and who
will be so glad, if they 're awake, to welcome him back) at 7.50 from
Boulogne quay. Isn't this good news for those who love the
"transit"—(the Latin adverb is purposely omitted as being un-
pleasantly suggestive), and who glory in rapidity of action and
poetry of motion?
DOCTORED!
SIK HBNRY IRVING, bo-knighted and be-dottor'd, is now LL.D.,
of Cambridge, and is, therefore, a degree better than he was before.
He is now a Doctor of the " Drama's Laws," and was described in
glowing terms by the Public Orator, Dr. SANDYS (the O. SANDYS or
Cambridge SANDYS), who was not gravelled for lack of words or
ideas, as " Agendi et dicendi artifex peritissimus," and was com-
plimented as one who would have been "amicus Ciceronis" (had
Sir HENRY been HENRICCS IRVINOIUS, Eques), and on the most
amicable terms with his two Ciceronian contemporaries, " Kosciug
and .dSsopus." W hereupon Sir HENHICUS was heard to muttei
softly to himself, "How he soap us!" Then there was great
cheering, and the popular manager and actor, likewise Rede
Lecturer, although humbly classing himself by Act of Parlia-
ment (14 Eliz. ch. 5) with SHAKSPBARB as "a rogue, vagabond,
and sturdie beggar," knelt low to receive the Honorary Degree
to which, as well as to many other honours, his life of honest,
earnest work, of high aims and straightest and directest ways
to attain them, has justly entitled him.
Sir HBNBRY IRVING we greet with applause,
At Cambridge they 're made you a Doctor of Laws;
Dr. Punch grants you more as a great " man of parts,"
He declares you to be a true " Master of Hearts.

OP Collections and Recollections (SMITH, ELDER), my Baronite
greatly prefers the "Recollections." Almost any one with wide
range of reading, and average literary ability, could have made
the "Collections." To few has been given opportunity for musing
over the "Recollections." One Who Has Kept a Diary (who con
he be ?) has not only enjoyed, on intimate terms, the personal ac-
quaintance of men like Earl RUSSELL, Lord SHAFTESBURY,
Cardinal MANNING, Lord HOUOHTON, Mr. GLADSTONE, and Mr.
C. P. VILLIERS, but he has the gift of drawing out veterans to
talk of men and monarchs they have met. Thus we get at first
hand, with further reach, touch with notable men' of earlier
generations. "One Who Has," &c. (a parlous long title;
much more convenient to give a name, or even four initials), is
endowed with varied gifts for the work undertaken. He has a
keen eye for character, quick sympathy with humour, writes ad-
mirably, and, as mentioned, has, by the accidents, of birth and
fortune, enjoyed rare range of opportunity. Much has been
written about Lord HOUOHTON, Cardinal MANNING, and Lord
SHAFTESBURY. "One Who," Ac., in a few pages presents new
and vivid portraiture. He has a rich store of good stories, and
they lose nothing in the telling. But, like CHAUCEB,
who left half told
The story of Cambuscan bold,
"One," &c., stops short of not the least interesting part of his
story. He should tell us his name.
RICHARD MARSH has written not a few stories more interesting
than the one bearing the attractive title of ram Ossingfon's
Ghost (JAMES BOWDBN). "Alas, poor ghost!" very poor ghost.
There w a ghost, so much the Baron confidently guarantees;
but for not one of the personages in whom the ghost appears to
be interested will the reader, unless he differs in his tastes from
the majority of readers, care one ghostly dump. The idea of the
ghost is there, but 'tis only the ghost of an idea, and—well—the
Baron, as ghostly adviser, will say 110 more on the subject.

FORECASTS OF DRAMA.—It is rumoured, says Mr. CLEMENT
SCOTT, in his entertaining and instructive Daily Telegraphian
article, "Drama of the Day " (and night as well), "that one of th(
great effects in the Drury Lane Autumn drama" is to be n
scene in a balloon. The hero and heroine, or the heroine and
the villain, the stars of the piece, will be up ever so high, and.
like some pictures at the Academy, will be "skied." However,
it is uncertain, and in any case, the promised effect is, as Mr.
SCOTT savf
nvbibus."
THE CORNER CORNERED.—" No man will lose a penny through
me," Mr. LEITEH is reported to have said to an interviewer.

ment. However, the trembling speculator may construe it hope-
fully, and retire to rest with a LEITER heart.

SENSATIONAL AERIVAL OP MR. GILDERSON BOOMBTOCK (THK NEWEST SOUTH AFRICAN MILLIONAIRE) AT SPATELY BRIDGE
TO MEET THE OTTER HOVKDS!
"THE.RIKG" AND THE BOOK.
Thursday, June 9.—Siegfried. Briinnhilde, anticipating sex-
theory of Herr SCHENK, had arranged for Siegfried to be a male
child. Since yesterday has been born all right, and grown to a
fine strapping boy of about forty-five summers. Prototype of
HORATIO NEWON, he knows no fear, and plays with wild bears
and things. Finds society a little limited in cave of his
grotesque adopted parent, Minie, and would like to have a nice
sword and see the world, being in rude health.
Like Perseus, Mime has designs on local dragon, but would
prefer the boy to do it for him. So he goes on making German
swords that break as soon as you look at them. Presently grand-
papa H'otan cornea in and they have a conundrum match. Be-
longs to Travellers' Club, and takes liberty of wandering a little
from text. Tells Mime that what ho wants for his weapon is a
fearless forger, like Jim the I'i'iiman. Finally retires, after
receiving limelight full on blind eye, which gives Mime the
panics.
On recovering, latter puts Siegfried through sharp rim vocr
on topic of Fear, of which the untutored boy's ignorance is quite
unique. So he is put to the bellows, where he develops into
a rattling good Harmonious Blacksmith, and turns out sword
with such an edge on it that it slices the property-anvil in two
at first time of asking.
Herr BREUER, as Mime, not made up to look beautiful; but
gets the last ounce of meaning out of music as difficult as a man
could desire. Even makes me believe that WAGNER himself might
sometimes be humorous of malice prepense.
In Second Act, Siegfried goes to flesh his new blade in ribs of
Fafner, proprietor of Rhine-gold, who, for private reasons, not
disclosed, has assumed shape of first-class dragon. Bird sings
ventriloquially in pleasaunce outside front-door of Fafne.r's cave.
Siegfried looks about trees for it. I could easily have told him
where it was. Not on bough at all, but inside a COT Anglais
just under my nose in orchestra.
M. JEAN DB RESZKE now makes a penny whistle out of arti-
ficial reed, and tries to compete with bird; but gets discouraged,
his talent being rather vocal than instrumental. Admits defeat
Bird, I will own
Mv ear is bad;
Thy calf ill it has caught!—
In shame I am'.lost
As he lurkingly listens,
I know he learns frum me n ithing.
Audible sensation through house on appearance of titillative
dragon. Only men unaffected are Siegfried and leading mem-
bers of WAQNER Society. Dragon has a green railway-signal
(for "caution") in each eye-socket. Thing sticking straight
up out of his lower front teeth is not brace of carrots but forked
tongue. Mouth opens so wide that I can see internal arrange-
ment of green signal at back of optic nerve. Confess to be dis-
appointed in dragon's agility; particularly as regards his tail,
which does hardly any of the stage-directions in my Text-Book.
Fafner ought to know something of the prize Ring, but is obvi-
ously short of training, and goes down early in first round,
signalising defeat by turning off green light of eye. Soft thing
for Siegfried, whose sword comes out of fight dry as a bone,
though he gots a little blood on hands, which he wipes with tongue.
Cannot explain connection of ideas, but effect of this is to make
bird up tree sing songs with words instead of without. It is
FrSulem VON ARTNFH who does it. Never, since the hoopoe
business in liirdt of ARISTOPHANES at Cambridge have I heard
better imitation of inspired fowl. Ah! how she filled with
honey all the grove!

as I remarked to one of Faithful on my left. "Hush!" was
his reply.
Siegfried, taking wrinkle from bird, declines to drink deadly
grog offered by Mime. Has tasted blood, and in fit of creative
art, as DE QOTNCEY'S Toad-in-the-Hole would say, puts sword
through foster-father. Curtain falls on spirited duet between
bird and DE RESZKE, former doing smart bit of work on invisible
wire across stage.
During interval, observed our new musical novelist in lobby;
face lit up with high hope (since realised) that Messrs. W. H.
SMITH would secure success of work by boycotting it.
Third Act brings on Wai-father, determined that his daughter
Brunnhilde shall still remain Wai-flower. Siegfried, however,
not to be denied. After a few preliminary cuts in text, severs
the old gentleman's spear ; and passes on to stir up sleeping beauty.

Indignation among Purists at expurgation of original WAONER.

Shall myself interview management, and write letter of complaint
to Press; but having complimentary ticket, do not care to ask
for money back at doors. Am further shocked to find scene of
Sriinnhilde's trance completely changed during last half-century.
Fresh background, bed higher up stage, and fresh lady lying on
plane inclined at fresh angle.
Cannot understand how Siegfried mistakes Madame NORDICA,
in that dress, for a man. Where are the greaves of which my
Book speaks? Another insult to the WAGNER Society!
Awful pause, while Brunnhilde, comes to with long, wooden
gestures, and total disregard of suitor iust behind her. Sub-
sequently her passionate appeals to auditorium leave Siegfried
very bored. Most unfortunate commencement to courtship:
which, nevertheless, ends hanpily enough, with brilliant finale
and complete understanding between lover and maiden aunt.
Saturday, 4 p.m.—Gfitterd erung. Twilight of gods falls
rather early for time of year. Scene opens with tootling of
three Norns (not horns, as the Standard has it). The plot,
till now a trifle thin, begins to curdle. Briefly, Sienfried, after
honeymoon in midst of fiery furnace, sallies out in search of
distraction: pledges his gold boon in exchange for wife's horse:
drinks in bad company: commits bigamy; is further charged with
marrying first wife over again, second wife being still alive; is
murdered in small of back; waves his arm about ten minutes
afterwards: and finally proceeds to Walhalla by way of pyre.
JEAN DE RBSZKE, after most unkindest cuts given and received
by self and brother in last play, feels naturally indisooped. Herr
TiiPPET,, having got up part over-night without rehearsal, dope
himself great credit in a shirt that looks like "love's last shift."
Chief credit, however, for unrehearsed effects goes to stage-
carpenters, not in programme, though they are discovered on

Then, aeain, roof of Gibichnng Court, fixed un loosely so as to

SALVE CALVE!
Thursday last, at Covenl Garden.—En/in! Madame Calved,
as Marguerite, in GOUNOD'S ever-popular Faust, when a brilliantly-
filled house over and over again summoned Madame Calve to
receive its enthusiastic plaudits. It was for Calve' a veritable
triumph. But—the " but" must come in—was it the true Mar-
guerite? As to singing, yes. As to acting, yes, with a qualifica-
tion. Calve does not allow herself to look the part. Madame
Calve1 is a "fine and large" woman (which tells against her as
the maiden still in her early teens), doubly "fine and large"
when viewed side by side with so elegant and so Blightly-buflt a
lover as is Monsieur SALEZA. Why, one playful slap from the
lily-white (over-bismuth'd) hand of the substantial Fraulein
would send the poor gentleman into the middle of next month!
To balance this young woman, a Faust of JOHN DK RESZKE'S
proportions is required.
In the two earlier scenes, that is, from her first entrance to
the end of the garden scene, Madame Calv^'s Marguerite suggests
a madchen "with a past, for most certainly she seems to
be "one who knows." She has the demure air of a full-blown
Sainte Nitouche, and one's pity is excited, not for her, but for
the inexperienced noodle who falls in love with her. As for
Madame Calve^s "business," which it is our business to note

the spinning-wheel situation. But CalvS, acting on the Scotch
proverb of 'leaving weel alone," walks away from it and leaves
tt to spin a yarn by itself, if so inclined. AH else is excellent.
As a matter of fact, however, our old friend Faust wants
to be re-staged, re-dressed, and re-juvenesced.

CHAVCK. for a Tenor I Aye, and a sad change, too, when old,
pecuniarily unfortunate, the once popular favourite has to beg
assistance from the "gentle public," which, having ever "sup-
ported" him, and received its quid pro quo for so doing, will
generously do its best to support him once again and receive
bis grateful thanks. Let everyone who can give two fivers (more
or less, according to means) for this Tenor, send them to the
Daily Telegraph (which has started the subscription), addressed,
"Hon. Sec., Dr. BECKER, 16, Montague Street, Portman Square."
Much will it rejoice SIMS REEVES to receive, as a friendly, sym-
pathetic testimonial, these genuine notes as substitutes for those
he has lost for ever. SIMS REEVES is an old "Friend in Need ";
let us all be his '' Friends in Deed."
"GENTLEMEN v. PLAYERS."—These distinctions seem wrong.
Of course, the first speaks for itself. But "Players "? Here,
they are not "Stage-players," but "Cricket-players." Yet are
not the Gentlemen also Players? If they are not, how unfair
is the match! Why should not the term be '' Amateur v.
Professional Players"? A match between the Stage and the
House of Commons would be so announced, and what an inte-
resting match it would be with Sir HENRY IRVING and BEERBOHM

Of course, the first speaks for itself. But "Players"? Here,
they are not "Stage-players," but "Cricket-players." Yet are
not the Gentlemen also Players? If they are not, how unfair

"THREE MEN IN A BOAT."
AND BO it came about that Mr. Punch's Representative,
having been unable to attend at the premiere of the Opera written
by Messrs. ARTHUR PINEHO, COMTNS CARR, and Sir ARTHUR
SULLIVAN; selected a later night (no offence to his musical
Knightship), when, by the kind permission of his "friends in
front," he was enabled to assist at the performance of The Beauty
Stone. With these three clever men all in the same boat, and
D'OTLET at the CARTE-wheel, the piece ought to have been
exactly what it isn't, that is. brilliantly amusing. To adapt the
verse of Uncle Remus, we ask: —
0 CoMYNi CAKK! | Rittin" wid two ARTHURS,
Whan do you do dar, i AWtinjc 0-pe-ror?
And ARTHUR PINERO (who, we hear, has sailed for the land of
IBSEN), regretting his complacent affability in yielding to the
enticement, must be humming to himself, adapting the words to
a Sullivanesquo refrain from The Chief tain: —
1'iNnitu! I'INMU)! j 1 wish )ou had never
My popular pet, i These gentlemen met!
(JJa capo, ever to many tiuifs, increasing in intensify.)
Mr. WALTER PASSMORE plays "the Devil." He is fearfully and
ineffectively made up, and appears to be a kind of disappointed imp
out of a pantomime, with little to sing, and nothing worth
doing, in this uninteresting story. Miss RUTH VINCENT is nice as
the lame heroine, supported by the entire strength of a crutch,
which is not by any means the biggest stick in the piece, though
to name names would be invidious. There is, too, a lack of
"go" in the movements of the present Savoyard chorus-singers,
as though the ancient traditions, taught them in their original
Savoyard infants' school, "when all the world was young," were
fast fading from the memory of such remnants of tha vietile
garde as are still "retained on the establishment on account of
their past service" by a grateful management. As for the act-
ing, it is, with the exception of the old stagers, rather amateur-
ish. From a merely popular point of view, is there any song,
or chorus, which anybody with an ear can catch and take away
with him? Yes, just a march; but if any one takes that away
with him there won't be much left that is ever likely to become
popular. Ah! when will these three meet again? Ah!

upon setting fire in the Drawing-room

did not take his meaning. He answered,
"Then take my advice. Back Herminivs
for the Stakes, which are not .'ikely to be
overdone on a day like this. My source
of information is an infallible relish for
them." And so it proved to be. Sir
FRAISER also very kindly, on the Cup Day,
when I met him with a magnificent Roth-
schild Regalia in his mouth, siemficantlv
tapped it with his forefinger, and observed,
"I hold the winner between my lips. It's

perhaps not better things. Nevertheless,

SQUIRE'S Budget, but another's. For him
to sit on Front Bench an interested spec-
tator; for ST. MICHAEL, buttressed by
impregnable sweetness of temper, to meet
and repel attack on the financial scheme
of the year. Y'et in one of its main pro-

been all that succeeded his great work of

By his treatment of the Death Duties
the SQUIRE built an ample, comfortable,
nest, in which, through all time, Chan-
cellors of the Exchequer shall snugly dwell.
It is all very well for a Unionist Govern-
ment to build ships, strengthen the army,
succour the landlord, and sustain Church
Schools. Where would they have been
if the SQUIRE had not turned on the richly-
flowing tap of the Death Duties?
Peculiar charm of evening is, that whilst
ST. MICHAEL, the highest financial autho-
rity on the Unionist side, led the attack
on the Budget of 1894, did all in his
power to destroy it, it now falls to his lot
attacks from his own side. No one, not
even that audacious mariner, CAP'EN

repeal of Death Duties. But insidious

House of Commons, Monday, June 13.—
What with friends who stab in the back, foes
who smite in the face, and the general pre-
valence of stupidity amongst mankind, the
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD'B lot is not a happy
one. Yet even his life has its oases of
serene content. One bloomed to-night.
House in Committee on Budget. Not the
SQUIRE'S Budget, but another's. For him
to sit on Front Bench an interested spec-
tator: for ST. MICHAEL, buttressed by
impregnable sweetness of temper, to meet
and repel attack on the financial scheme
of the year. Yet in one of its main pro-
visions the Budget is the SQUIRE'S, as have
been all that succeeded his great work of
1894.
Sic VOB nnii robu nidificatis aves.
By his treatment of the Death Duties
the SQUIRE built an ample, comfortable,
nest, in which, through all time, Chan-
cellors of the Exchequer shall snugly dwell.
It is all very well for a Unionist Govern-
ment to build ships, strengthen the army,
succour the landlord, and sustain Church
Schools. Where would they have been
if the SQUIRE had not turned on the richly-
flowing tap of the Death Duties?
Peculiar charm of evening is, that whilst
ST. MICHAEL, the highest financial autho-
rity on the Unionist side, led the attack
on the Budget of 1894, did all in his
power to destroy it, it now falls to his lot
attacks from his own side. No one, not
even that audacious mariner, CAP'EN
TOMMT BOWLES, goes so far as to suggest
repeal of Death Duties. But insidious

CHAEL is obdurate in resistance, righteously

Business done.—JOHN o' GOHST carries
second reading of London University Bill.
Thursday.— Everything comes to the
man who waits. JOHNSTON, peering over
the battlements of the ancestral castle ot
Ballykilbeg, has long been waiting for
opportunity to shy half a brick at the
Pope. At Belfast the other day, when
JOHN DILLON was, as he told the House,
"riding in the tail of the procession" of
Catholics trailing their coat past the
Orange quarter, he, by proxy, enjoyed the
luxury. That a way of disporting yourself
as second rate as it is second hand. What
JOHNSTON of Ballykilbeg yearns for is a
go at 'em in House of Commons.
To-night opportunity presented itself;
dragged in by the hair by the piratical
SAM SMITH. Joy of situation intensified
by its unexpectedness. SAM SMITH, in
spite of his buccaneering personal appear-
ance, is almost last man one would asso-
ciate with a row. Yet to-night he brought

assembly, has potent influence. Raised
to-night in piping voice of the Flintshire
Buccaneer, it brought back to him un-
wonted echo of cheering. Dinner-hour at

leapt in. Then was there fine fluttering,

Natural conclusion of stranger in the

be torn in shreds. What really happened
was that the hostile amendment was re-

beyond the present mighty maximum at

against 75, to proceed with consideration
of Benefices Bill.
Friday.—Suddenly, unexpectedly, com-
pletely, JOHN o' GORST makes up for long
silence noted in Tuesday's entry. Moving
Education Estimates in Committee he gives
Voluntary Schools, to which last year bis
colleagues devoted large sums of public
money, a knock-down blow. This avowedly
done in best interests of a system he, as a
devout Churchman, dearly loves. Best for
its interest that he should be quite candid.
"These are facts I might suppress," he
said, "but cannot alter. They are most
unpleasant to those who, like myself, desire
the maintenance of Voluntary Schools."
"That's all very well," said J. G. TAL-

OPERATIC NOTES.
IN a recent notice, one of Mr. Punch's Young Men picked
up the esteemed Daily Telegraphesque Operatic Representa-
tive for saying that in the Nozze di Figaro, the Countess
refused an encore for the "Dove Sono," and Mr. P.'i
Young Man insisted that the Telegraphian critic must have meant
"Kusanne." In proof of his assertion, Mr. I'.'s Young Man
referred to printed book of Opera, where Susanne. in Act I.,
commences "Dove sono?" At the hearing or the case,
however, before Mr. Punch, it was pointed out that these two
words, though indeed used by Susanne in the first act, are also the
first two words of the well-known song given by the Countess in
the second act, where the words are, "Dove sono i bei momenti,"
&c., for which Madame EAMES, as Countess, declined to take
an encopf*. Mr. Punch's Young Man, admitting " trap de zele,"
withdrew the statement and himself. Causa finita est.
Wednesday.—Hamlet. The plot of the Divine WILLIAM, the
libretto by the Un-divine WILLIAMS, from the French ofCarrdand
BAKDIER, and the music by A MIUIOIM--. THOMAS, Princes? of \V ALES
and Princess VICTORIA present. Madame Calve', as Ophelia, ex-
cellent, both vocally and dramatically. The finest "Sister Mary
Jane's top note " is not in it with Calv6's. As to her acting, cela
va sans dire, as naturally it would if it were simply un lull, I
d'action. That she cannot quite look the ideal maiden is no
more to be expected than that she can look Marguerite. But 'tis
Calv^'s own Ophelia, and that is sufficient for any devout Opera-
goer. It is gratifying to learn that no accident attended her
wonderful mad scene, as in it she "brought down the house."
At the cc.inmencement of Act V., Hamlet enters, and has a scene
all to himself; very nice and pleasant, and quite in accordance
with the published libretto. But on his retiring, for which no

provision is made in the book, there enters Kimj Claudius

he says and sings is there in the book, nor is there any mention
of how Hamlet re-appears, saying, "Now could I kill him pat"
(though he is not speaking to an Irishman), as he does in the
genuine drama, doing exactly what Master WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE
intended him to do. V\hy this omission?
No matter; all went as right as passible, and in Act YI. the
Court of King Claudius may be congratulated on having the
best ballet, "The Feast of Spring," that could be provided for
the festive occasion which is brought to so sad a finish, and the
Opera to so triumphant a climax, by the death of Ophelia.
Why didn't SHAKSPEARB think of this? Decidedly an improve-
ment on the original.

EXPEBIENTIA DORSET;

"DARN my old beans and ba-acon if

here our own prime Dorset melts away.
"Parker's Piece," that is, the piece
adapted from the French by Mr. Louis
PARKER, must be an attraction to all
Cantabs retaining fond memories of their
University days. Of course, "thicky thar
pratty ply" (we drop into it again) has
no more to do with the University than
with the Royal Academy. But "where
do 'ee come from P What brings 'ee?
What be 'ee 'ere vor?" There we are
again in Dorset dialect, asking questions
which, unless the public takes to the play,
it will be a trifle difficult to answer satis-
factorily in the plainest English. "Hassen
nowt to zayP" (Bother the dialect!)
Oh! yes, Ragged Robin has a lot to say,
and precious little to do. Ragged Robin
is a Rambler—latest edition—and rambles
in his talk as wildly as he careers, with
w^hoops and shouts, about "the King's
highway." Muchly should we like to see
"thicky thar actor-chap" (beg pardon!
dropped into Dorset again!) as either
Rip Van Winkle, or Jiarnaby lludgr, if
the latter character could only be worked
into a really good drama.
In the true managerial spirit of grand
unselfish, artistic self-effacement, Mr.
BEERBOHM TREB, in giving us a romantic,
undramatic drama, adapted from JEAN
RICHEPIN'S Le Chemineau, translated into
the slightly unintelligible Dialect of Dor-
set, assumes the part of a very Wandering
Minstrel who has snatches to sing, lots to
say, and little to do. Parker verba. There
is scarcely a laugh in it, except when the
raddled-faced stage peasants roar at their
own wit (which, however, it must be ad-
mitted is a touch of nature), and hardly a
tear. The piece offers a great chance to
CHARLES WARNER, who has to appear, first
as a vigorous, and then as a paralytic,
prematurely decrepit farm labourer, whose
"conduct in the chair," as they say at a
public meeting, is the theme of universal
admiration. His simulated feebleness when
galvanised in momentary muscular ac-
tion is terribly realistic. His mumbling
death, still in the chair, is, so to speak,
true to life; neither pleasant, nor patheti-
cally touching, but unpleasantly powerful.
The drama also furnishes Mr. FRANKLYN
McLEAY with a character somewhat on the
lines of the old miser in Les Cloches dt
Corneville; and it also givos Mrs. TREE the
part of Alison, which, both as girl, and
matron (" with a past"), she plays to per-
fection. Miss MILLAR!* has to be pretty
and sympathetic, in which she is thoroughly
successful. Mr. LEWIS WALLER represents
a sturdily honest peasant; while Miss HAL-
KETT, and Messrs. STEVENS and Du MAU-
RIER appear as three more or less unintelli-
gibly "happy peasants," who had made
themselves up after the fashion of the
highly glazed and coloured pictures of
countrymen in a Christmas Number.
It ends abruptly and unsatisfactorily, in
a ragged fashion quite in keeping with the
title. The histrionic successes are those of
Mrs. TREE, of Mr. McLEAY, and ot
CHARLES WARNER; in fact, were a second
title required, it might be called Ragged
Robin; or, Charlie's Chance. To quote
the words on the programme, placed
as motto to Act IV., "Good-bwye—
zo long!" But "How long?" That is the
question. Scenery simply charming, and
acting good, wherever there was anything
to act.
FROM A " SPOOK."—There is no on«, pro-
lwlily, who would be more anti-pathetic to
the aims and objects of the Psychological
Society than that stout Cromwellian, Mr.
KENSIT, whose battle cry is, "Take away
that bauble!" But with his weather-eye
well open for all the doings of the most
ultra ultras, could he not be fairly described
as practising "Spy-ritualism?"

OPERATIC NOTES.
IN a recent notice, one of Mr. Punch's Young Men picked
up the esteemed Daily Telegraphesque Operatic Representa-
tive for saying that in the Nozze di i'tparo, the Countess
refused an eiicorw for the "Dove Sono," and Mr. P.'i
Young Man insisted that the Telegraphian critic must have meant
"Susanne." In proof of his assertion, Mr. P.'s Young Man
referred to printed book of Opera, where Susanne, in Act I.,
commences "I)ove sono?" At the hearing or the case,
however, before Mr. Punch, it was pointed out that these two
words, though indeed used by Susanne in the first act, are also the
first two words of the well-known song given by the Countess in
the second act, where the words are, " Dove sono i bei momenti,"
&c., for which Madame EAMES, as Countess t declined to take
an encom. Mr. Punch's Young Man, admitting "trap de zile,"
withdrew the statement and himself. Causa finita est.
Wednesday.—Hamlet. The plot of the Divine WILLIAM, the
libretto by the Un-divine WILLIAMS, from the French of Carre and
BAHDIER, and the music by AMBKOISK THOMAS. Princes? of \YALES
and Princess VICTORIA present. Madame Calv6, as Ophelia, ex-
cellent, both vocally and dramatically. The finest "Sister Mary
Jane's top note " is not in it with Calyx's. As to her acting, ccla
va sans dire, as naturally it would if it were simply un ballet
d'action. That she cannot quite look the ideal maiden is no
more to be expected than that she can look Marguerite. But 'tis
Calve^s own Ophelia, and that is sufficient for any devout Opera-
goer. It ia gratifying to learn that no accident attended her
wonderful mad scene, xs in it she "brought down the house."
At the ctMimeucement of Act V., Hamlet enters, and has a scene
all to himself; very nice and pleasant, and quite in accordance
with the published libretto. But on his retiring, for which no
Plancon), and again the libretto is at fault, for not a word of what
provision is made in the book, there enters King Claudius
(played in his usual melodramatically-significant style by Jupiter-
he says and sings is there in the book, nor is there any mention
of how 11 amlet re-appears, saying, "Now could I kill him pat"
(though he is not speaking to an Irishman), as he does in the
genuine drama, doing exactly what Master WILLIAM SKAKSPEARE
intend,-i 1 him to do. Vvhy this omissiont
No matter; all went as right as possible, and in Act VI. the
Court of King Claudius may be congratulated on having the
best ballet, "The Feast of Spring," that could be provided for
the festive occasion which is brought to so sad a finish, and the
Opera to so triumphant a climax, by the death of Ophelia.
Why didn't SHAKSPEARB think of this? Decidedly an improve-
ment on the original.
Friday Night.—Memorable. House suddenly closed. "No
song, No supper!" Fraulein TEHNINA and Madame NOBDICA
indisposed. Great row in Ring where seats Book'd.
EXPERIENTIA DORSET;
Or, "Parker's Piece" in the Haymarlcet, London.
"DARN my old beans and ba-acon if
thicky thar ply bean't as pratty "But
here our own prime Dorset melts away.
"Parker's Piece," that is, the piece
adapted from the French by Mr. Louis
PARKER, must be an attraction to all
Cantabs retaining fond memories of their
University days. Of course, "thicky thar
pratty ply" (we drop into it again) has
no more to do with the University than
with the Royal Academy. But "where
do 'ee come from? What brings 'ee?
What be 'ee 'ere vor?" There we are
again in Dorset dialect, asking questions
which, unless the public takes to the play,
it will be a trifle difficult to answer satis-
factorily in the plainest English. "Hassen
nowt to zay?'1 (Bother the dialect!)
Oh! yes, Ragged Robin has a lot to say,
and precious little to do. Ragged Robin
is a Rambler—latest edition—and rambles
in his talk as wildly as he careers, with
vijhoops and shouts, about "the King's
highway." Muchly should we like to see
"thicky thar actor-chap" (beg pardon!
dropped into Dorset again!) as either
Rip Van Winkle or Jiamaby Rmlge, if
the latter character could only be worked
into a really good drama.
In the true managerial spirit of grand
unselfish, artistic self-effacement, Mr.
BEERBOHM TREE, in giving us a romantic,
undramatic drama, adapted from JEAN
RICHEPIN'S Le Chemineau, translated into
the slightly unintelligible Dialect of Dor-
set, assumes the part of a very Wandering
Minstrel who has snatches to sing, lots to
say, and little to do. Parker verba. There
is scarcely a laugh in it, except when the
raddled-faced stage peasants roar at their
own wit (which, however, it must be ad-
mitted is a touch of nature), and hardly a
tear. The piece offers a great chance to
CHARLES WARNER, who has to appear, first
as a vigorous, and then as a paralytic,
prematurely decrepit farm labourer, whose
"conduct in the chair," as they say at u
public meeting, is the theme of universal
admiration. His simulated feebleness when
galvanised in momentary muscular ac-
tion is terribly realistic. His mumbling
death, still in the chair, is, so to speak,
true to life; neither pleasant, nor patheti-
cally touching, but unpleasantly powerful.
The drama also furnishes Mr. FRANKLYN
McLEAY with a character somewhat on the
lines of the old miser in Les Cloche* dt
Cnrneville; and it also gives Mrs. TREE the
part of Alison, which, both as girl, and
matron (" with a past "), she plays to per-
I fection. Miss MILLARD has to bo pretty
and sympathetic, in which she is thoroughly
successful. Mr. LEWIS WALLER represents
a sturdily honest peasant; while Miss HAL-
KETT, and Messrs. STEVENS and Du MAU-
RIER appear as three more or less unintelli-
gibly "happy peasants," who had made
themselves up after the fashion of the
highly glazed and coloured pictures of
countrymen in a Christmas Number.
It ends abruptly and unsatisfactorily, in
a ragged fashion quite in keeping with the
title. The histrionic successes are those of
Mrs. TREE, of Mr. M< I.KAV, and ot
CHARLES WARNER; in fact, were a second
title required, it might be called Ragged
Robin; or, Charlie's Chance. To quote
the words on the programme, placed
as motto to Act IV., "Qood-bwye—
zo long!" But " How long?" That is the
question. Scenery simply charming, and
acting good, wherever there was anything
to act.
FROM A " SPOOK."—There is no one, pro-
bably, who would be more anti-pathetic to
the aims and objects of the Psychological
Society than that stout Cromwellian, Mr.
KENSIT, whose battle cry is, "Take away
that bauble!" But with his weather-eye
well open for all the doings of the most
ultra ultras, could he not be fairly described
as practising "Spy-ritualism?"

DABBY JONES REJOICES OVER
NEWCASTLE AND ANTICIPATES
NEWMARKET.
HONOURED SIR,—There are Moments in
Mortal Life when a Man feels proud of
Himself. Such Lighthearted Lapses of Time
are those when an Owner leads in the
Winner of the Derby; when a Playwright,
be he Melodramatist, Tragedist, or Extra-
vaganzist, plants his feet between the Cur-
tain and the gentlemen of the orchestra;
and above all, when a Prophet is of right
in his own country. Such, my Patron,
has been my Good Fortune at Gosforth
Park. I not only plumped for King Crow.
but selected the gallant Hermimiis ana
the somewhat doubtful Villiers for those
places which it also pleased the Eye of
the Judge to select. I have often—alack
and well-a-day!—been confronted with
the power of a Judge comfortably ermined
on the Queen's Bench, but I have never
recognised that any one of these Poten-
tates, superstructured with Horse-hair, has
equalled the Genial Dictator who gives his
fiat in matters of Horseflesh.
Honestly, I do not like "Canny New-
cassel." Its reputation seems to be built
on a Preposterous Bridge and a Reputation
for coals. Most of the shopkeepers appear
to wonder that they ever sold anything at
all. So do I. As Captain KHITERION justly
remarked when we were speeding to Gos-
forth Park. "These Northerners have only
one idea—Tyne is money." I fancy, how-
ever, that KRITERION was a little vexed
because he had failed to induce any of
the Sojourners at the Hotel where we
stayed to back CarHon Grange for the
"Derby," as, strangely enough, they call
the Handicap Plate in this Golconda of
Black Diamonds.
Count GROGANOKF and Baron BROKSTETN,
still intent upon acquiring horses for the
Continental Cavalry in view of the threat-
ened Invasion by the United States Army,
were as delightful as ever, and, after the
victory of King Crow, presented me with
a Solid Silver Matchbox in the name of
a Potentate whom I dare not name on this
side of the German Ocean. Our friend,
the Honourable FLIFLATT, was also present
with his Fidus Achates, Sir MILKY WAT.
I regret to say that both these gentlemen
lost money by backing the Jenny Howlet
colt, the property of Mr. CHARLES PERKINS,
who, although no relation of the famous
damsel of Paddington Green, was known.
I am given to understand, as "Polly,"
when he boarded at the house of the ever-
to-be-esteemed the Rev. W. B. MARRIOTT,
at Eton College, Bucks. Mr. PERKINS is
like Lieutenant, COLB, "a funny man,"
and be is a co«l man as well. Sometimes
he pulls off a Big Prize unexpectedly, but,
as often as not, he means to do the trick
and doesn't. One of these days Mr. PER-
KINS will win the Dprby quite without warn-
ine, and no one will be more surprised than
himself or Mr. I'A.vsov. These Northern
Liehts are, as Baron BROKSTEIN observed,
"Clpvrrer than n Bullnmn CPT tull of Ba-
boons." A stale simile, which I take
leave to stnte does not apply to Mr.
PFIKINS or Mr. I'^NSON.

FLANNELS in moderation are pardonable,

The cuisine of a house-boat is not always

The humours of burnt-cork minstrelsy
must be tolerated during an aquatic carni-
val, but it is as well to give street singers
as wide a berth as possible.
In the selection of guests for, say, The
Pearl of the North Pole, or The Hushaby
Baby, it is as well to learn that none ot
them are cuts with the others, and all are
prepared to accept "roughing it" as the
order of the day.
Lanterns, music, and fireworks are ex-
tremely pretty things, but night air on the
river is sometimes an introduction to scia-
tica, rheumatism, and chills.
In the selection of a costume, a lady
should remember that it is good to be
"smart," but better still to be well.
Finally, it is desirable to bear in mind
that, pleasant as riparian life may be,
Henley is, after all, a regatta, and that
consequently some sort of attention should
be paid to the racing.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM TRB DIART OP TOBY, H.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 20.—
SARK, with all his faults, is not a Party
man. He rather belongs to the class
described by the late Lord GRANVILLE as
"the Cross Bench mind." Taking a
friendly interest in both political parties,
he is beaming with satisfaction to-night at
the news that the Liberals have got over
their difficulty and have secured a Leader.
I was under the impression they had one
in the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD. It seems
that, contrary to their traditional habitude,
the Liberals, broken up into varied sections,
are common in the tendency to cavil at
their leaders. Some want one man; some
another; most secretly believe that, if
persistently pressed, they could find a
Heaven-born leader not far from their own
home. By imperceptible steps the real
leader, the man who will unite under his
flag all factions and segments of fractions
of the party, stands revealed. His crown-
ing claim to the enviable position is that
the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, not apt at
playing second fiddle, is ready to follow
his lead, has. indeed, already conspicuously
and effectively done so.
The new Leader is the man whom Flint-
shire delighteth to honour—SAM SMITH!
Has long been a member of the House,
a not infrequent contributor to it« debates.
Hitherto rather overlooked, not to say
snubbed. But the Man was waiting only
for the Hour. It came to him with the
introduction of the Benefices Bill. Then
he suddenly appeared in his true colours.
Unfurling the flag of the Protestant
Church, relighting the torch smouldering
since the spacious days of Queen ELIZA-
BETH, he revealed himself in a new and
startling light. To-day the House knows

Bublnpearian or Supralapsarian?

that SAM SMITH is a Man of War. (To-
morrow he may, SARK says, be known as
the SAM SMiTH-field Martyr.) Instantly,
instinctively, without ceremonial, he was
accepted as Leader of the Party. As such
he has directed operation to-night, loyally
supported by the late Leader of the Oppo-
sition and the party generally.
"Now," says SARK, "we shall see things
hum. You wouldn't think it to look at
him, or when listening to hia average
speech. But there's a good deal of
RANDOLPH CHURCHILL in SAM SMITH."
Business done.—Benefices Bill fought inch
by inch on report stage.
Tuesday.—Only yesterday recorded ar
rangemenfc that seemed to promise peace
and plenty to Liberal Party. As SARK,
dropping into poetry, remarked: —
"Ban, ban, Calaban;
Got a new Leader, feel a new man."
Within less than twenty-four hours, have
heard the new Leader called a Sublapsa-
rian. WALLACE guilty of this outrage.
Following at some distance one of SAM
SMITH'S impassioned assaults upon sacer-
dotalism, he, drawing on early resources
of study, informed House that the creed
of the Church of Scotland is intentionally
ambiguous on the controversy between
Hupralapsarianism and sublapsarianism.
The consequence is that in that favoured
country a man may, with perfect security
to his person, hia reputation, and hia pro-
perty, be either a supralapsarian or a
sublapsarian.
"I do not know," he said, turning to
contemplate the martial figure of SAM
SMITH, "which of the two the hon. gentle-
man is. I have looked at him carefully,
and think he has the air of a sublapsarian."
House roared with laughter; but graver
spirits saw in this outbreak of indiscipline
occasion for profound regret. It is pro-
bable that WALLACE meant nothing disre-
spectful or derogatory to the new I/eader.
He was, perhaps, primarily allured bv the
temptation to overcome the difficulty of
pronouncing words of this structure
between eleven and twelve o'clock on a
sultry night. Also, the fact that the
SQUIRB OF MALWOOD has loyally accepted
the new Leader ii of itself provocation to
WALLACE to attack him. His Parliamen-
tary career has from the first been marked
by an unaccountable antipathy to the
SQTTTRE. Howevpr it be, the public affront
and its lamentable consequences are indis-
putable.
Dr. TANNER, a great stickler for order,
had his doubts whether the use of the
word sublapsarian is Parliamentary. If
he had been quite sure he could have
safelv steered throuch the sea of sibillant
syllables, he would have asked the ruling
of the SPEAKER. After privately trying
them over, he thought it prudent to
abstain.
Business done.— Banging through the
Benefices Bill.
Thursday.—•" I am not sure," said Mr.
COURTNEY, "that in this matter the House
is not moved by a spirit of pedantry."
Somebody smiled; smile grew into
a titter; titter swelled to burst of
laughter running round the crowded
benchei. COURTNEY stood at gaze, like
JOSHUA'S sun at Ajalon, only with a more
marked glance of pained enquiry. Had
he, in snite of honest intention, made a
iokp? There was certainly nothing to
laugh at in circumstances of the moment.

in a cluster of water bills. General objec-
tion taken to procedure. President of
Local Government Board made haste to
withdraw lest a worse thing faefel him.
Then COURTNEY interposed with observa-
tion quoted, and with consequence
recorded.
The mystery of the spontaneous burst of
laughter was one of the few things in the
wide world that passed COURTNEY'S com-
prehension.
"This House dear TOBY," he said, "is,
as MACAULAY discovered more than sixty
years ago, the strangest place in the world.
Man and boy, I've known it for twenty-
two years; but it always has something
Fresh about it. At the meaning of most
of its moods, one can guess. But why,
when I casually reprove it on the charge
Df displaying a spirit of pedantry, it should
burst into laughter, is, I confess, more
than I can fathom."
Business done.— Benefices Bill passed

A WAIL OF THE WEATHER. .
WHEN you go for a- trip, '_ •
It commences to drip.
Isn't the weather atrocious!
At the sight of the rain
It is hard to restrain
A feeling of fury ferocious.
When the day turns out wet,
All feel so upset,
Ah! doesn't it spoil your excursion?
And you gloomily tramp
Up and down in the damp—
In which there is not much diversion.
Those in mackintosh clad
The elements they are defying;
. But those .who are drest
In their holiday best,
Find weather of this sort most trying.
On the $ea, if you go
In a boat for a row,
When below there is no place of shi-lter;
It is hard, I am told,
An umbrella to hold
In your teeth, when it comes on a pelter.
Then it can't be denied , ,
It wflre wise to abide
At home by the fireside cosy,
With your pipe and your books,
You will find that life looks

A NEW WAY WITH BANKERS.
Wife. "BY THE WAY, OLIVE, I HAD A LETTER FROM MY BANKER
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY. HE SAID I HAD OVERDRAWN MY ACCOUNT."
Husband. "YES, BEAR; AND WHAT DID YOU DO?"
Wife. "I TOLD HIM NOT TO BE SO BUDE AGAIN; AND I SENT

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
DR. CONAN DOYLE has well named his verse, Songs of Action
(SMITH, ELDER). It pulsates with life and movement, whether
the scene be laid on sea or land, on ship or on horse-back. To
a pretty turn for lilting verse, the author of Rodney Stone adds
the instincts of a tale-writer. Nearly all the pieces have a story
to tell. They are, in fact, notes for novels. In " The Storming
Party," for example, my Baronite discerns material for a three-
volume novel of the antique, now extinct, order, the last issue
having been buried under London Bridge for the delectation of
the New Zealander when he comes to view the ruins of St. Paul's.
Of mere episodes, never has a horse-race been described with
greater vigour or with bolder colours than in "The Farnshire
Cup."
Evelyn Innes (FISHEB UNWIN) is, in the Baron's humble
opinion, the best work that Mr. GEORGE MOORE has as yet
given us. Having set himself the task of describing life as it
is in. fact, not in notion, he shirks no difficulty, but
tells a plain tale so very plainly, that, but for his style,
his closely-observant analysis of character, and his pecu-
liar, if not quite original, method of associating music
with morality,—reminding the Baron of another novel where
the "die. faro" of Orpheus supplies the key-note of action,—
the old materials of the tale itself would scarcely be worth the
stringing together. What is it but a series of variations on the
old theme that served DICKENS for the incident of Little Em'ly
and Steerfortti, that was woven into the life of David Copper-
field? It is the story of a girl, inheriting from her dead
mother a marvellous voice, religiously brought up by her father
who is a weak-minded musical enthusiast, a kind of Tom Pinch,
so absorbed in his art, and so occupied in the professional duties
of organist and teacher, as to have taken little more than a selfish
interest in his daughter's education. The girl's " artistic tempera-
ment," of which a wealthy, cynical, middle-aged sensualist takes
cruel advantage, is her ruin, morally, as it is her triumph, pro-
aged lover'* pleasure to cultivate. Then follows her decadence,
and just at the point when, another false step downwards would
make it still more difficult for her to retrace her steps upon the
upward path, she comes across Monsignor Mostyn (an admirably
imagined portrait), who leads her back to the straight and narrow
way, and—leaves her there. This is the end, so far, but her
career is to be "continued in" Mr. MOORE'S "next." Decidedly,
though a remarkable book, it is not one that can be indiscri-
minately recommended. Having taken up his parable, he works
it out consistently and conscientiously, giving himself as much
trouble over the smallest details as a pre-Raphaelite was
wont to bestow on the careful delineation of most minute ac-
cessories. The book must increase Mr. MOORE'S literary repu-
tation as a novelist; and it will cause the judicious1 admirers of
his skill to hope that it is only one of the rungs of the ladder by
which he will mount to higher things. "We live in a, damned
wicked world," says that " worthy man," Sir Peter Teazle, "and
the fewer we praise the better." Read aright, the story points a
verv clear moral, et ca donne a penser.
Of Mr. Punch's Animal Hand (BRADBURY, AONBW, & Co.),
drawn and written by E. T. REED, the popular "Prehistoric Peep
Show" man, it does not become the Baron to speak in too lauda-
tory a strain, lest he be accused of deviating from his own
rigid plan of strict impartiality; yet, admiring the excellent
example set by a certain worthy every-afternoonly contemporary,
when unable to suppress its just admiration for the work of its
own clever black-and-white man, the Baron may venture to say
that never, in the whole course of his long and insufficiently-
chequered career, has he seen a collection of cleverer, funnier,
and, in a general way, more intensely amusing caricatures
of Contemporaneous Celebrities than is to be found in the handy-
sized, well-got-up book whose attractive title heads this Baronial
paracranh. Every Collector of Comical Animals throughout the
world should provide himself with a sample of this eccentric
creation, the possession of which, will thus enrich his Zoological
Library. THIS BARON DE B.-W.
THE NEW D/PSOMANIA.
[According to the Pan* correspondent of the Jinily Ttlegraph, a snjonrn of
twenty minutei in a tub into which a hundred litres of Malvoiiie hare been
poured is a mort invigorating proceu, and the operation can be repeated a
hundred timm over with the same bathful. MnreoYer, the wine u not lost

For a vinous old soul is he—e,

In these novel ablutions he never doth fail,

Oh, Bradfield students! I have much to say
to you, and little time to say it. One
thing, however, I must tell you. Our trien-
nial play must be given on ancient lines.
Tradition must be respected. Too often
of late years has the Greek theatre been
profaned by ladies, when all must know
that in classical times no female foot ever
trod the stage. This shall not happen with
us. Woman • is rash and reckless, par-

in where the angels fear to tread. But OUT
Antigone shall be played, by one of the
Sixth Form!

of her cigarettes and her divided skirts.
Lo! she has even forced her way into
the theatre, and trod the sacred stage
of DIONYSUS—an unholy <'W.' At the
rlo.\e of their song, enter First Messen-
First Messenger. Oh, CREON ! I have come
to you to announce a terrible thing. In
spite of your recent proclamation two ladies
have signified their intention of playing
the parts of Antigone and Ismene.!
Creon (in fury). Now, by the Gods,
bring them to me and we'll see!
[He frowns terrifically. The, Chorus sing
of feminine obstinacy and its punish-
ment. They gire instances. At the end
of the song they point menacingly to-
wards Miss ANTIGONE and Miss
ISMENE, who have been brought in by
an armed guard.
Creon (severely). Have yoti not heard
my proclamation that no lady shall tread
our classic stage?
Miss A. (coolly). Don't try to frighten
me. I will play Antigone. I decline to
be dictated to. I have just tried on the
Peplus, and I look perfectly bewitching.
I shall play her fifty times better than any
gawky, scrubby school-boy.
[Lights a cigarette.
Creon (alarmed). But tradition forbids
that Antigone should be played by a lady.
What will SOPHOCLES say?
Miss A. I don't care about tradition,
or SOPHOCLES either. I have doue up my
hair in the Greek mode, and it looks
Miss I. And I look quite classical in my
mourning robe. All the other ladies will
envy me. We are determined to act in
the Greek play, eo there! "Ce que la

DISMISSED MY COACHMAN t YES. He DROVE OVER TWO PERAMHULATORS, THREK
O, AND A POLICKMAN."
You DON'T SAY so! WHERE is HE NOW?" 'GONE TO PARIS TO BE A CABMAN.'
THE VERY NEWEST "I/LNTIGONE."
f" At th* performanres of the Antigone of
SOPHOCLKH at JJradfield College, last week, the
parts of Jtitifinnr anil Imiitne, in d« fi«fre of ''la«-
riral tradition, were played by ladies."—Daily
Ptper.]
Creon (addressing the Churn*, who group
the in si'I res picturesquely about the orchestra).
Oh, Bratlfield students! I have much to say
to you, and little time to say it. One
thing, however, I must tell you. Our trien-
nial play must be given on ancient lines.
Tradition must be respected. Too often
of late years has the Greek theatre been
profaned by ladies, when all must, know
thnt in classical times no female foot ever
trod the stage. This shall not happen with
us. Woman • is rash and reckless, par-
ticularly the^modern woman. She rushes
in where the angels fear to tread. But OUT
Antigone, shall be played by one of ihe
Sixth Form!
. [He seats himself. The Chorus sing of
the rash daring of the modern woman,
of her cigarette*, and her dirided skirts.
Lo! slit has even forced her way into
the theatre, and trod the sa-cred stage,
of DlONYRUg—OH unholy it red! At the
clom: of their song, enter First Messen-
First Messenger. Oh, CRBON ! I have come
to you to announce a terrible thing. In
spite of your recent proclamation two ladies
have signified their intention of playing
the parts of Antigone and lament.!
Creon, (in fury). Now, by the Gods,
bring them to me and we'll see!
[He frowns terrifically. The Chorus sing
of feminine, obstinacy and its punish-
nient. They give, instances. At the end
of the song they point menacingly to-
wards Miss ANTIGONE and Miss
IHMENK, who have been brought in by
an armed guard.
Creon (severely). Have you not heard
my proclamation that no lady shall tread
our classic stage?
Miss -1. (coolly). Don't try to frighten
me. I will play Antigone. I decline to
be dictated to. I have just tried on the
Peplus, and I look perfectly bewitching.
I shall play her fifty times better than any
gawky, scrubby school-boy.
[Lights a cigarette.
Creon (alarmed). But tradition forbids
that Antigone should be played by a lady.
What will SOPHOCLES say?
Miss A. I don't care about tradition,
or SOPHOCLES either. I have done up my
hair in the Greek mode, and it looks
Miss I. And I look quite classical in my
mourning robe. All the other ladies will
envy me. We are determined to act in
the Greek play, so there! "Ce que la
femme, veut— You know the rest, un-
less it is quite " Greek to you."
[Exeunt triumphantly.
Creon. Aiai. Ototoi. (A Greek method
of expressing griff.) All my plans come
to nothing. My commands are set at
naught. What is the good of being King
of Thebes if nobody does what you tell
them? Oimoi, Oimoi, I am the most un-
happy of men. What, will SOPHOCLES say?
Lead me out, my attendants. Take me
away. In ancient days I could have walled
up Miss ANTIGONE in a living grave for
this, but we live in strange times, and it is
not safe to wall up a Pioneer. [Exit.
[The. Chorus sings of feminine vanity and
the sorrows that it brings, ending up
with an invocation to DIONYSUS not to
punish them for this outrage, upon the,
traditions of his stage.
A LIPIGRAM.
LOITERER lingering
Long near the "cast,"
Lost to a lonely life,
Landed at last.
Linked to a loveless lass,
Loud the lament;
Longing for liberty,—
Lips laxly lent.
Lawyers and levity,
(Laughter in Court;)
Loss of lump £ s. d.,
Liberty bought.
