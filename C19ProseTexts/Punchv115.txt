PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH (wcaki-ny continuously). MADAME LA REI-UUHQUE (mute).
SCENE—TIte terrace at Mun'e Carlo.
Mr. l'tuw/i. Neutral ground, Madame, and the most natural spot ou earth for tlie serious interchange of amenities.
A prey to nervous prostration, you have conic here to recruit yourself far from the madding crowd of boulevard politi-
cians, "mobiliiim turlta Quiritiiiin," if I may so put it; me at this moment you may behold snatching a brief respite
from the strain of punting at the green-cloth, from laying the fleeting louis on the spot which the glowing wheel ever
contrives to elude—" metaque feri'idis ei'itala rotis," to cite my FLACCU.S once more. Tranquillity therefore becomes us
both. Allans, soi/ons cnlmes; which means that I will do the talking.
Observe the fine sweep of blue before us from Monaco to Cap Martin. This is the same sea—here where the
stillness is broken only by the paltry detonations of the tir atuc pii/eons—which we lately proposed to incarnadine,
making the blue one red. That is past, Madame; frank words have been spoken on our side and good sense has
prevailed on yours. But permit me once more to talk to you like a father. We are not a pincushion, Madame, as some
of your friends have fancied. Punctuate us enough, and we shall bleed, and perchance make bleed. It is one of your
traditional fallacies—such as that which attributes projecting teeth and huge feet to my most charming countrywomen—
that France possesses the monopoly of honour. We too keep a little at need.
And, dpropof, there are just now some certain smutches—pardon me—on your escutcheon, unworthy of a gallant
army and a great nation. Make clean, Madame, make clean; whether or not you mean to use it against a foreign foe.
Any evil confessed and purged is better than a secret shame. And, believe me, it is not from petty malice, as you
seem to think, that our journals have urged upon you the difficult choice of expiation. A nation of shop-keepers, if you

will; but we have an old fancy for fair dealing ; and we look for it in our neighbours as ourselves. So let the Judgment
of Paris, as we hinted weeks ago, be wise to recognise the claims of justice, in the person of Pallas Athene ; since
“Because right is right, to follow right
Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.”
Give the award where it is due :-
“O Paris,
Give it to Pallas !”
You will, I know.
And, for Heaven's sake, Madame, purify that Press of yours, so corrupt by habit, so ignorant by choice. It has
done more than fifty Waterloos or a hundred Fashodas to poison the hearts of your people and pervert them from the
knowledge of their natural friends.
So may the way lie clear and clean before you that leads to that century's close which is to summon half the
world to witness your triumph in the Arts of Peace. À la bonne heure ! And there is none, you must believe, who will
rejoice in that triumph with more sincerity than your humble servant.
In proof, I beg you to accept a token of that profound esteem and affection which, through all misleading signs,
I hold for you. Do me the honour to glance within, and you will find straight words, that may seem to savour of
offence : trust me, Madame, straight words make quickliest for a better understanding.
My man, Toby, will deliver this tribute with all the speed and decorum of which he is capable : for he shall know
that he bears no less a freight than my
One Hundred and Fifteenth Volume !

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Do you want a change from analytical novels and solutions
of life-problems? If you do, take the Baron's advice, ask for
ANNA KATHARINE GREEN'S ~Lmi Man's Lane (PUTNAM AND SONS),
and " see that you get it." When you have got it, choose a quiet
time, say a couple of hours to yourself, just before "bye-bye,"
if your nerves are in the very best condition; select a com-
fortable corner, a shaded bright light, while the rest of the
room is in darkness, and then and there the Baron leaves you to
thoroughly enjoy one of the pleasantest, creepiest stories, in the
crime-and-detective line, he has come across for some considerable
time. The secret is well kept up to the end, and the most ex-
perienced of detective-minded readers will not find it the easiest
thing in the world to get on the right track.
"Iti.iHs, SANDS & Co." are the publishers of Mr. J. ASHBY-
STERRY'S latest up-to-datest story. A publishing firm rejoicing
(and can they do anything else except rejoice ?) in such a title
ought to deal only with holiday literature, treating exclusively of
the delights of the sea-side, of the pleasures of piers, of paddling,
of building castles of sand, of digging holes, of lazing about
doing nothing and assisting others in all the varieties of that
particularly pleasant occupation. "BLISS, SAJTDS & Co. I"
Wisely did Mr. ASHBY-STERRY, the Laziest Minstrel that ever in-
dolently twanged the lyre and filled the hearts of the Petticoats
with delight, wisely did he select this Blissful firm as the chaperons
of his Naughty Girl, who, of course, must be as " Nice " as she is
"Naughty." But is she so very "naughty"? The reader must
answer the question. The critic who has formed his idea of
"naughtiness" from a George-Mooreish novel, will most likely
acquit Miss Beryl of the charge.

"And then the train went into a tunnel."
That is a quotation. Doesn't it whet your appetite? What
happened? "Where was the tunnel? Was it on the L. C. & D.
line, just running into Ramsgate and issuing sur la plage? If
so, think of the publishers again, and there you have the sum-
ming up, "Bliss!" and in less than two minutes (ah, how nil
too orief is such happiness!) they are in the broad daylight in
full view of "SANDS & Co." 1 Success to AsHBY-STERRY-o'-type I

A TIP FOR THE TRIPPER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I see that you have been giving advice
"how to enjoy a short trip" in this (now) delightful weather.
Let ine give you my experience. The other day I had one of
the pleasantest jaunts in my life. I will give it you from my
note-book as jotted down in what may be termed "Jinglese."
Started after breakfast. Absurdly cheap return ticket; good
for the entire season. No hurry. la first-class carriage.
Pretty scenery. Kent beautiful. Smart run of an hour to
Gravesend. No idea so much country en route. Train reaches
pier. Steamboat in attendance. Not too crowded. Most re-
spectable company. Fathers, mothers, and families. Efficient
band. Good luncheon. Best part of the lower Thames. Even
Southend picturesque. Short sea trip, then river again. Chvo-
ton charming. Harwich handsome. Felixstowe felicitous. Allite-
ration suggestive of special articles of daily paper. After Felix-
stowe the gem of the journey. An hour's delightful passage
between banks of green turf and forest trees. Here and there a
glimpse of ivy-covered towers. Country seats in the distance
most impressive. Tea and shrimps. Return to deck; pretty
scenery continued. And at 5.20, Ipswich!
There, 3/r. Punch. Take my advice; you can ring the changes
on the Belle Boats, where you need not feel ashamed to be
CAUGHT TRIPPING.

OPERATIC NOTES.
How any one gifted even in the slightest degree with dramatic
and artistic instincts could conscientiously appear as the heroine
of La Traviata in a variety of costumes of the present "so-called
nineteenth century," while all the other principals, and the chorus,
are attired as ladies and gentlemen of the time of CHARLES THE
SECOND, is just one of those things on the Operatic stage that
"no lellow can understand." It it intelligible that the male
Operatic choristers would not shine in suits of reach-me-down
sables provided by the costumier as per contract, and that, in
low-cut ball-dresses, the "giddy young things" of the "spindle-
side" would not appear to the best advantage. These reasons
may he r, satisfactory explanation of the fact that the Opera is
not played in modern costume. But that Madame MELBA, hav-
ing bro'i made aware of this fact by the Operatic stage manager,
should still cling to her modern fashionable attire, is incompre-
hensible. If the stage manager did not inform her of it, then
she nuHt have bean considerably surprised on finding herself in
modern dress alone among the remnants of the sixteenth century.
According to this, Madame MELBA might play Nedda in Pagliaeci,
dressed as a fashionable London lady or as a Parisienne; and on
another occasion, JEAN BE KESZKK, following suit, might play
liomro in such a costvune as he would don for a London garden-
party, all the other characters being in Veronese costumes, Man-
tua-made, of the fourteenth century. But why complain? An edu-
cated audience, representing most of the rank and fashion, and
some of the talent, will put up with any absurdity on the Operatic
stage, without uttering so much as a single ill-bred plebeian mur-
mur. Sotto voce, and to one another, they smile; but protest 1 not
a bit of it. The effect of Madame MELBA, singing perfectly as
Violetta, appearing in nineteenth-century costumes (beautiful
too!) among the sixteenth-century ladies and gentlemen, is as
absurd as if Sir HENRY IRVING were to play Hamlet in a suit of
sables of this present date, with craped "topper" and black
gloves to match, while all the other actors were attired in costumes
worn by the rank and fashion of Denmark at the period generally
assigned to the action. M. BONNARD is a very nice little Alfredo,
poor young man! All doing excellently well, including Signer
MANCINELLI, who brings put a new Opera this week, entitled, Hero
and Leander, a little thing of his own. In this Opera the Hero
is a Heroine. Leander, the classical Professor of Swimming, we
suppose is to be Signer SALEZZA. Success to the merry MANCI-
NBLLI, and may his Opera, Leander-like, get on swimmingly, and,
un-Leander-like, not become one of the "submerged."

THERE used to be buttercups once on these meads,
There used to be reeds by the bank,

There isn't a corner for quiet repose,
While the nose is most constantly shocked I

And oppressed with the bottles o'erthrown!

PUNCH^OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SOCIAL WHIRL.
(By Onejtahf it in'it.)
INTRODUCTORY.
The following bright and "snappy" little paragraphs have
been specially written for Mr. Punch by a lady who assures him
that she mores in the most select circles, and that the accuracy
of her information may be absolutely depended upon. Irlr. Punch
cannot say that he has the honour of being acquainted with any
of the personages whose dresses and doings are so minutely re-
corded, but possibly some of his readers may be more fortunate,
and even if they are not, they will, he is sure, peruse this social
chronicle with no less interest on that account.
IN THE GROVE.
Everybody one knows seems to make a point of congregating
in Westbourne Grove these fine Summer mornings. Last Mon-
day there were any number of pretty and distinguished people
to be seen there. Little Mrs. FROGBWELL (who is so often taken
for the Honourable Mrs. MOOKOW) was looking very sweet and
distinguished in a plaid blouse with a collar of machine-made
lace and a "picture-hat." Mrs. PIPKIN was walking about with
Mrs. BRASS-POTT, and Mrs. STUCKOE-PBELE, in a costume of
brick-red faced with cream, and a bent hat and parasol, was ex-
amining a "line" of marvellously cheap gloves in Mr. STRET-
CHER'S shop window. Then Mrs. GOTTEMON, quite one of the
prettiest women there, wore bright turquoise blue velvet, with
a sash of pink tulle and a mauve toque. Mrs. BET/WEATHER.
looking regal in a ruby velvet hat and an ermine cloak, chaperoned
Miss BABY" GJGOLESWICK in a little muslin-sprigged frock,
much befrilled, which, though perhaps a little short, looked par-
ticularly fresh and pretty. Miss FRT/MP, who has a great name
for neatness, looked wonderfully smart in a dust-coloured tussore
silk, with drab linen collar and cuffs; Captain COPPER, looking
the picture of health, in a straw hat, frock coat, and brown
boots, escorted Miss "GUSSIE" GOLTJLEAF, who was all in green
gauze, and, unless I am mistaken, it was pretty and sparkling
Mrs. "TOM" TINSELL who rode by on her * bike." Altogether,
quite a remarkable gathering of smart folk.
A SMART Hion TEA.
Mrs. BELWEATHER'S High Tea, at Whiteley Terrace, on
Tuesday afternoon, was perhaps the most brilliant affair of its
kind that has transpired for years. All the best and smartest
people in Society were to be seen s°atpd round Mrs. BELWEATTTER'S
hospitable mahogany, and her well-known parlour was full to
overflowing. Among the great ladies "present were Mrs.
GOTTEMON, gorgeous in green foulard, with serpent-like inser-
tions, and a toque of sulphur-coloured tulle, with a pink aigrette;
Mrs. "TOM " TINSET.L, a vision in cloth of gold and silver tissue;
and Mrs. STUCKOE-PEELT!, wbo came on from a Shakspeare Read-
ing Society at Shepherd's Bush, looking very sweet, but a little
tired. Miss GICGLESWICK looked wonderfully well in tulle illu-
sion. Mrs. FROOSWET.L and Mrs. BRASS-POTT both brought their
girls, nnd Mr. "ALF" ROWSER, who looked in on his way from
the City, brought his concertina. Mr. "HERB" LARKTNB and
Captain COPPER were expected, but were detained at Henley.
After tea, which was quite excellent, there was a small and
rather Bohemian party, one or two literary and artistic persons
beini" present.
The next day Mrs. BF.LWEATHER had her dinner.
AN INTERESTING GARDEN PARTY.
Quite the smartest open-air function this season was Mrs.
SAMUEL SHKKYT.L'H crarden-party at Jordan Crescent, Maida
Vale. Mrs. "!KEY" SOLOMONS looked very un-to-dflte in a large
check, and Mm. SAUT, SHENIE was splendid in plum-coloured
Roman satin and gold passementerie. Mrs. BET,WEATHER, as
usual, smothered in ermine, brought Mrs. DAVID RUBENSOHN in
trrass-creen and maize, with touches of orange in her toque.
Miss REBECCA KOSHERFLEISCK, who always dresses with NO much
taste, came in crimson foulard with a vellow tulle sash and a
hat of pnle blue chiffon. A very charming and original feature
of the nfternoon was the institution of a sort of huffrt under a
tent, where lemonade, claret-cup, and even strawberrv and lemon-
water ices ooultl be obtained on application—a fashion which is
certain to be followed at similar entertainings. Among the
pupsts wore Mr. "Mo" LEVERTON, Mr. "BENJT" ISAACS, and
several other smart men.
[PARENTHESIS BY MR. PUNCH.
Mr. Punch must candidly confess that he is rather at a loss
to account for the change of tone in the succeeding paragraph,
in which the note of genial and almost reverent appreciation
seems strangely lacking. Whether the accomplished chronicler
has had any differences of opinion with her fashionable friends,
whether she wearied of the monotony of unqualified praise, or
whether she was simply out of temper at the time, it IB not for

Old Gent. "Is IT A BOARD SCHOOL YOU GO TO, MY PEAR?"
Child. "No, SIR. I BELIEVE IT BE A BRICK ONE!"
Mr. Punch to say. He can only print his correspondent's cop
as it stands, and trust that it will not expose him to any actioi
for libel.j
A DULL DANCE.
The general opinion about Mrs. FROGSWELL'S dance s
Busting Lodge, on Friday, seemed to be that it was an utt<
failure. To begin with, there were no programmes (making:
impossible for a partner to remember which particular dance li
was engaged for), and a hostess whose drawing-room is of til
dimensions of Mrs. FROGSWELL'S, should either not have tl
Green Hungarians at all, or else put them in the back gardei
Not, however, that it signified, for the crowd was a very ordinal
one, and the few people with any pretensions to smartness wh
came, only looked in tor a few minutes. Perhaps it was the pal
green paper shades over the gas-globes, which would have been tri
ing to a really pretty woman, but Mrs. GOTTEMON was looking quit
ghastly, and I heard it remarked on all sides that she is a con
plete wreck this season. Mrs. STUCKOE-PEELE, who is beginnin
to have a worn look, brought her girl, but I did not see he
dancing. Miss "BABY" GIOGLBSWICK seemed to be enjoyin
herself in the conservatory. After all, I suppose it is only coi
sistent that people should "go on" as rapidly as they "go off.
Miss "GUBSIE" GOLDLEAF looked almost girlish in the pink tull
which she always wears on such occasions. Mr. ROWSER did hi
best to infuse some animation into the "Kitchen" quadrille!
and his diamond solitaire stud was the centre of such brillianc
and sparkle as there were. Mrs. "TOM" TINBEI.L danced severs
dances with Captain COPPER, who is not at all well just now, an
was certainly no better for having gone into supper three timoi
Mrs. SAUL SHENIE (the Jewish element was rather overwholn
ingly represented) positively shone at the supper-table, in spit
of the fact that the champagne was none of the best. By som
oversight, Mrs. BELWEATHER, who looked very warm and ur.
comfortable in black velvet, was not asked to go into supper-
perhaps none of the young men present had the requisite coin
age. However, it may console her to know that she did no
lose much. The dancing, like the floor, was wretched, and th
early hour at which the last of her guests departed must have cor
vinced even Mrs. FROGSWELL that her social ambition had re
suited in a deplorable fiasco. She is leaving town soon, fo
Margate.

MR. PEEPS' DIARY AT HENLEY.
Tuesday.—This day the aquatick contests at Henley, and I
thither, though a great distance from Town. Paid a half-guinea
to the varlet who giveth out the tickets, and sundry other monies
for programme, of which I understand but little, and for sport-
ing papers, of which I comprehend even less. To the platform
of departure at Paddington, the Company very numerous and in
fine attire. Observe a couple of knaves get in to my railway
coach, and as soon as the train start, commence playing of cards.
Asked by them to adventure certain monies upon the picture-
card in a game where but three cards, in all, are used. Did so.
and at the first, did win a pound—called, methinks, a "couter"
—and pocket the same. But, continuing to play, did lose each
time, until I owe them five pounds, at our journey's end. Did
give a banknote for Five Pounds, which, seeing a Police In-
spector approach, one of the varlets did hastily Pocket and hurry
away. Did feel glad to see the last of such Sorry Rogues, and
made a Resolution to avoid any further intercourse with the
fellows. To the River, where great To-do of Flags, and Barges
gaily decorated. Did walk through the gates on to the fine
Lawn, when the Guardian was Not Looking, and did Ruffle it,
with the Best. Comes a Policeman, who, seizing me by the
collar, puts me outside again. Much diverted by the numerous
small Craft upon the River, but wishing for a more Compleat
view of the Racing, presently manage to Again slip in through
the gates and nearly to the lawn once more, but just caught by
the tail of my fine new coat, and Hauled Outside yet again by
the same Policeman—a churlish fellow, but Persevering withal,
Lord! to see how changed are times, since, in mine own heyday,
the Watermen of Wapping Old Stairs did contest for a Coal
and Badge, challenging the Watermen of London Bridge. Me<
thinks 'twas finer sport, though far less of show and no be-deck
ing of the great Barges, which I now perceive are dubbed
"House-Boats." Many minstrels, their faces blackened, and
twanging Ban-Joes, as they call them, but to me more like e
Warming-Pan with musickal strings. Good LackJ What strange
dress they did assume, and collars all too large and not of anj
fit whatsoever. Did offer a knave four-pence for a seat in hii
wherry, as I would have adventured up on the River, but he mak«
merry at my expense, and place his Thumb unto his Nose anc
spread out his Fingers lengthwise, and was otherwise disrespeckt-
ful and Unseemly in his Conduct. Espying my Lord of CORKER
TON Very Busy with a Hamper, did accost him in friendly tonei
with An Eye upon his Sparkling Wine. But he, continuing t<
consume his Toothsome Viands, did offer me none of his hospi
talitie. Whereupon, wishing his Lordship a Change of Climat(
(though the day was Not Cold), I left him. Witnessed sundrs
of the boat-races, and was much diverted at sight of a strip oi
wood and canvas, which they call An Outrigger. Lord! to thin!
that any man would adventure his life in such a whimsical thing
and not at all to compare with the honest Waterman's Wherrj
of mine own time. But, in one thing, was well pleased; th<
ladies, though no longer Sighing and Ogling, much comelier ir
dress than or yore. But in all else, disappointed. And so bacl

SILOMO, SILOMO! beware of the day
When thy managing-editor's driven to bay I
For a cloud of calamity darkens my sight
And thine England lies low in oblivious night.

From thine innermost bosom, and ruthlessly flung
To the ravenous people, and lol the whole nation

False wizard, avaunt! I have marshalled my staff.
They are oldj far too old, to be caught with thy chaff.
In vain, 'tis in vain that thy warnings are muttered.

Ha! Latigh'st thou, SILOMO, my vision to scora?
Proud Member for Sheffield, thy pride shall be torn.
For look! Who is yonder? I see her e'en now,
The light'ning in eye and the thunder on brow.
Her glance is destruction—it falleth on thee 1—
Ah! mercy, dispel the dread vision I see!—
Thou tremblest. thou palest—thou fall'st to the plain—
Thou writhest about in thine impotent pain,—
I see thee, SILOMO!—Thy glories are fled,
A heap of mere ashes, all shrivelled and dead
With the wrath of the duchess thou daredst to diddle—
Silomo.
Down, soothless insulter! I trust not thy riddle.
What! Think'st thou the cheek of SILOMO will blench,—
RILOMO, the dread of the Treasury Bench,—
SILOMO, the hero of war as of peace,
That dared, all undaunted, the dungeons of Greece T
What! think'st that SILOMO will tremble and fly
From a duchess, a feminine duchess's eye?
Ro long as the SULTAN sits firm on his throne,
So long shall the name of SILOMO be known,
Ro long shall, bareheaded, the land of his birth
Bow down to the friend of God's Shadow on Earth.
ON OPEBATIC LINES.—BELLINI'S Norm-a is a work seldom givei

DABBY JONES LAMENTS ON THE
EXTINCTION OF STOCKBRIDGE.
HONOURED SIB.—This week must be one
of Mourning in Racing Circles for Stock-
bridge, that most delightful of Hampshire
meetings—the only one left, in so far as
I can remember, in the whole of the
County over which the Right Hon. the
Earl of NORTHBBOOK rules as Lord Lieu-
tenant—which, after vainly battling against
the Breeze of Gate-Money Gatherings, has
at last succumbed, and, as Sir KHAISKK
PUNNETT would say, is "Buy-buried."
It is not for My Humble Self to analyse
the various motives which have influenced
those responsible for the Cremation of the
Bibury Club and the Stockbridge Com-
mittee, and the transference of their
Ashes, in hope of Phoenix-like Resurrec-
tion, to the Bleak Downs which overlook
the Palatial Demesne of Lord PEMBROKE
at Wilton and the Unique Spire of
Salisbury Cathedral. I can only say,
like the Little Girls in the Good Fiction
written for the Edification of the Young
and Virtuous, "I am very sorry." From
the days of the Prince-Regent down to
this End-of-the-Century Conviviality, the
Bibury Club has been SELECT, and Stock-
bridge has conduced to its Selectiveness.
The Associated Forces may migrate to
Salisbury, but it will, in my feeble esti-
mation, be no longer the Dual Gathering as
celebrated in many a Tradition of the Past.
Stockbridge, celebrated by Lord DUCIB
and other far-famed Anglian Anglers for
taking Attributes with the Waltonian fly, is
a spot remote from the cognisance of the
Vulgar Herd, the coarse cries of the Cos-
mopolitan Backer and Booky. It was a
Nook reserved for the Cream of the Racing
World, not for the Skim Milk of the
ordinary Churners of the Course. The
stakes have never been of Brobdingnagian
Amount, but nevertheless Mighty Heroes
of the Turf have there proved their Inci-
pient Value. Let me only cite the splendid
Galtte More, who, but two years back,
gave early evidence of victories in store,
and rejoicing in the Castles of Gubbins.
It was at Stockbridge that I first made
acquaintance with the noble Captain KRII
TERION. He had just experienced some
unpleasantness at the Jubbah-Nuggah
Meeting in India, where, his horse having
won the Rajah's Vase contrary to orders,
he had fallen down in a fit, and had after-
wards to send in his papers to an unre-
lenting Colonel. Disregarding the cruel
slander passed upon his Unblemished Re-
putation by sundry Pharisees, I greeted
him the same evening with such unmistake-
able sympathy for his Misfortunes, at the
White Hart Hotel, Salisbury, that hia
Local Traducers were put to as complete
silence as though they were under cross-
examination by Sir EDWARD CLARKE, the
Attorney-General, or Mr. C. F. GILL.
Since then we have never parted in every
sense of the expression.
It was at Stockbridge, moreover, that I
subsequently had occasion to abruptly
leave the course for Winchester, owing to
an Unaccountable Attack made upon me
by a Low Fellow, with whom I had had
some Financial dealings at Newmarket.
It was at Stockbridge. also, that I lost

to deliver myself of some line«! calculated

nates to expend a few Shekels on Flowers
and Wreaths wherewithal to encircle his

cosely remarked, "Ah! yes; meeting going

EXTRACTED FROM THK DIARY or TOBY, M.P.
House of Cojnmons, Monday, June 27.—
"If you only know how, it is," says SARK,
"a very easy thing to govern a free people.
Take to-night, for example. Consider the
position of that blameless character, ST.
MICHAEL, whose association with All Angels
is more- than nominal. When, in 1896,
Soudan expedition decided upon, Govern-
ment were in a tight place. Memories of
the Sad Soudan did not endear district to
British mind, nor were they calculated to
make popular a fresh foray. If on top of
these considerations came prospect of
largs expenditure, JOHN BULL would cut
up rough. Accordingly ST. MICHAEL, in
capacity of Chancellor of Exchequer, was
put up to say that the war wouldn't cost
England a penny. Egypt would find the
men and find the money too.
"That statement, coming in middle of
debate that was growing serious, acted
with marvellous effect. War is wicked, we
all felt. But if it can be carried on at other
people's expense, with advantages mainly
accruing to us—well, we mustn't be cen-
sorious. Who are we to set up to be better
than our brethren? HENRY FOWLER dis-
turbed pleasantness of the moment by
more than hinting that this was all
humbug; that in the end_ England would
have to pay. He was hustled aside, and
Ministers triumphantly carried the day.
"A year later it was found that a trifling
expense of £800,000 had been incurred for
campaign. Egypt couldn't pay. 'Then we
must,' said the British taxpayer, wearily.
'Not at all,' said ST. MICHAEL (and you
might almost hear the rustle of the angels'
wings). 'We'll grant 'em a loan, dear
boy. Leave it all to me, and I '11 make an
honest penny for British Exchequer out

can raise the loan at and what we shall
charge Egypt.'
"Never was there such a far-seeing
Minister, such a clever Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Loan approved by rattling
majority. Another year passed, as they
say in novels. Here we are to-night with
Egypt again to the fore; three-quarters
of a million sterling wanted for Soudan
war expenses. Must be immediately forth-
coming, or somebody will be sold up.
What shall we do?
"ST. MICHAEL equal to this, as to earlier
emergencies. 'What shall we do?' he
says, smiling round Committee of Ways
and Means. 'Why, call the loan a gift.
It was a pound or two under £800.000

neighbourhood of bread-basket of the
"men who eat the bread of one Church
with the object of betraying it to another."
(Of course, it was the Church that was to
be betrayed, not the bread. That a detail
easily understood.) The SQUIRE a little
weighed down with the iniquity of man.
Ho has not only been misrepresenting the
SQUIRE'S sayings and doings in connection
with this Bill, but has been "playing
Pigptt" with the SQUIRE'S honoured name,
signing it to cunningly deviled fables sent
to the newspapers.
Characteristic of native simplicity of
SQUIRE that he provides REDMOND cadet
with opportunity of advertising himself as
champion of a Church that no one has
attacked. Cadet wrote a letter to Times
denouncing SQUIRE for insulting Catholic
Church. Times, which no longer lores
"Historicus," not only gave advertisement
free insertion, but used it to found attack
on the blameless SQUIRE. Now REDMOND
cadet rises to explain that when he laid
a definite charge at SQUIRE'S door, he didn't
mean him at all, but had SAM SMITH in
his mind!

spectful to the Port Admiral, courteous to
the ship's cook. Fancy a usually serene
temper was ruffled to-day by discovery on
reaching the Westminster Dock that his old
moorings above gangway were again
appropriated by piratical craft. In the
absence of that fine clipper the Jemmy
Lowther (gone on a cruise to Newmarket),
the CAP'EN got his berth, a real good one.
Still, he was riled, and the Port Admiral
firing a shot across his bows when he at-
tempted a foul, he showed his gnarled old
teeth.
Fleet looked on in alarm as the CAP'EN
answered shot for shot. "You have not
heard me," he shouted, when Chairman ot
Committees demurred to his moving
amendments taking precedence of Members
who had put theirs on the paper. "I have
heard you," said Chairman, emphatically.
"No, Sir, you have not," came the sharp
reply.
Duel went on for some anxious moments.
Chairman evidently not to be trifled with.
Another moment and the CAP'EN would
be named and suspended from the yard-
arm for the remainder of the sitting.
Crisis avoided by Chairman calling on
amendment next in order. So storm blew
itself out; nobody wrecked.
Business done.— Evidence in Criminal
Cases Bill passed through Committee.
Friday.—SARK much interested to hear
that Billy, the SPEAKER'S bull-dog, is
sitting for his portrait for the National
Gallery. A most remarkable dog Billy,
an honour to my race. Generally in a state
of profound meditation varied by occa
sional glances at any passing calf particu
laily comely. Would like to know his private
views on the Benefices Bill; on Tea on the
Terrace; on the actual value to the British
Empire of Wei-Hai-Wei; on the suspension
of the Twelve o'Clock Rule; on the exact
whereabouts of the Committee of Council
on Education; and on Mr. GBDGE.
SARK once met Billy at a country house,
and had opportunities for close observa-
tion. The floor of the hall was highly
polished, a circumstance that led to evi-
dence of temporary but deplorable short-
ness of temper on the part of Billy. On
leaving the dining-room after dinner and
attempting to cross this glassy surface,
Billy's almost elephantine body was too
much for his legs. He rolled and slipped at
every pace, his face betokening the sharpest-
annoyance, whilbt from his ponderous jaws
came a muttered noise uncommonly like
preternaturally awful swearing.
Billy does not approve his muzzle, and
if his start for his daily stroll in the Park
happens to be timed to the hour of the
meeting of the House, WALTER LONG likes
to reach his room by the House of Lords
entrance. This saves crossing Palace Yard,
and is, the President of the Board of Agri-
culture says, not much out of the way.

OVER THE ALPS
A BICYCLE.'
JENKINS IN THE ACT OF WISHING TO GOODNESS THAT HE HAD NEVER
BEEN INSPIRED BY THE WoRK WITH ABOVE-MENTIONED TlTLE!
HEMISPHERES I HAVE "EXTENDED" OVER.
(By a late Cambridge Lecturer '' in partitna.")
THE recent occasion of the Silver Jubilee of University Exten-
sion, celebrated under the patronage of His Grace, the Chancellor
of Cambridge University, prompts me to confide in the public
ear my experiences as a Missionary of Culture to the Heathen.
My subject divides itself almost automatically into two sections.
I.—THE KASTERN HEMISPHERE.
Am advised by my solicitors to reserve this chapter for
posthumous publication.
11.—THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.
If I am one thing more than other—and this is very doubtful
—that thing is a patriot. Small wonder, then, that I was pained
by a remark illustrative of the contempt of certain ignorant
foreigners for hig^h traditions of British Empire. Was seated
in Liverpool special en route for the States, being in train to
carry lamp of University Extension into dark places of Western
Hemisphere. Beside me was an American citizen on way home.
What high inspiration, I wondered, had he drawn from sojourn
among us?
"Been long in this country?" I asked.
"No," he replied; "I came over from Parrus last night, and
I tuk a cab ana drove around for two or three hours; but I don't
like uour cawfee."
This closed conversation. Impossible to preserve show of
friendly relations with stranger so grossly indifferent to those
qualities which go to make our national greatness. (May add
that present Anglo-American entente had not yet been fully
established.)
With this episode I associate another not less painful to my
patriotism. Our homeward-bound vessel was drifting up Mersey
on the most sombre autumn evening at which I have ever
assisted. "See here, my dear," said an American matron to
•mail daughter, as we collected baggage, "this is Great Britain;
and you will never see the sun again until you get to Parrus."
(This also was prior to Anglo-American understanding.)
YOU civ.
Coffee and climate 1 Is it by these that men judge of a nation
whose navy sweeps the boundless unplumbed ocean; whose Uoyal
Academy is the despair of foreign imitators; whose literature,
from the dim dawn of promise iu SIIAKSPBARB'S day, to its sub-
lime and effulgent setting in the Yellow but enough! Am
patriot, with patriot's prejudices.
Have always thought that dominant duty of patriot is to be
ignorant of achievements of other nations. May or may not be
ignorant about his own, but almost mutt be ignorant about the
others. That is how it was that, when Americans on board New
) ink City (now the fighting Harvard) spoke ot having national
gala on fourth of July, I naturally asked myself what the nation
had done to deserve it. So took down copy of U KEEN'S history
from ship's library, and read chapter or so about WASHINGTON
and Independence. Found it very poor reading, and determined
never to indulge curiosity again in manner unbecoming to
patriot. (Should add that I have lately discovered that fourth of
July is day set apart for Anglo-American dinners and mutual
admiration.)
Broke my resolution about indulging curiosity aa to other
nations' affairs, and was rewarded with severe blow to national
pride. Have referred already to my proper ignorance of foreign
history. Found that names of American national heroes had tor
me all the conquering charm of novelty. Name of a certain
Mr. HENRY CLAY had been often used in my hearing, and in-
variably in tones of unquestioned respect. Transpired, eventu-
ally, that this person had done something in Congress in early
part of one of the centuries. Apart from my principles, could
hardly have been expected to know so inconspicuous a fact.
I asked, "Did your man HENRY CLAY do anything besides
making cigars?"
The immediate answer—a rude and ignorant one, as I think—
took form of rhetorical question :—
"\\al, say, did your man WELLINGTON do anything besides
making boots?"
A propos of the neglected great, am reminded of personal nar-
rative told by Mr. M AUK TWAIN, which do not remember to have
aeen in print. Above humorist, ascending in elevator of lofty
warehouse, found himself facing General GRANT. In moment of
mental aberration failed to identify illustrious warrior; but being
of social turn of mind asked him if he was "travelling" in that
line of business.
"My name is GRANT," replied the veteran.
Recognising unpardonable error he had committed, humorist
retired from elevator some eight storeys below his destination,
"for fear," as he afterwards said, "lest I should ask him if he
had ever been in the Army!"
Ought to own that I rather like humour if it is not employed
at my expense or that of my country. In America found most
things sacrificed to humour of a kind; sacred feelings often
cruelly harrowed; sensitive skin, like my own, inclined to
smart under these scintillations.
"Your stars," as I said, in a moment of unguarded anger (prior,
of course, to Anglo-American exhibition of cordiality), your
stars, I see, are usually associated with stripes I"
This casual sally (not by any means one of my best) received
with marked approbation by company present, who from that
time onward exempted me from general charge of density so
freely lavished by the States upon my countrymen. (Am speak-
ing, of course, of a period previous to Anglo-, <fco.)
These trifling episodes, however, though interesting in them-
selves, have no direct bearing, it may be said, upon my Exten-
sion over the \Vestern Hemisphere. Was neither engaged to
lecture upon British Humour nor American History, though the
open mind with which I should have approached latter topic
was clear point in my favour. But my theme was serious and
literary; for, as stated in my syllabus, I proposed to discourse
On Some Alleged Obscurities in BROWNING'S Epic of SORDBLLO.
Was to be the guest of the improving municipality of Poesiopolis.
a watering-place much affected for its physical and intellectual
salubrity by elite of neighbouring city of Cultureville.
(Sliall continue th.it another time.)
A SUGGESTION IN NOMENCLATURE.—The old name of "Turn-
pike Roads" has, long ago, with the almost universal disappear-
nnce of the ancient turnpikes, become obsolete. Nowadays,
bicycles being " always with us." why not for "Turnpike Roads"
substitute KTurn-bdke Roads "P This ought to suit the

DEAR MIBTEB,—By hazard I have been presented, there
some time, to the President of the Temple, that sort of College
of the Advocates all to the near of the Palace of Justice. This
mister, of a great amiability, has had the goodness of to invite
me to dine in the ancient Hall. of the Temple.
I am enchanted. He appears that from the time of the Queen
ELIZABETH the advocates have dined in this Hall. They dine at
six of clock. Tiens, c'est drole! In England you dine very late.

Treasurer. Ah fa! Le President e'appellf. "Maitre Tresorier."
Perfectly. One conducts me to a room, where I find assembled
several misters in black robes. Hn astonishes me that they carry
not also these drolls of perruques of the english advocates. But
he appears that they are not some advocates, but some misters
who sit themselves sur un bane, on a bank, that is to say some
bankers.
Still some misters arrive, and then the Master Treasurer in-
vites me to accompany him, and we march, dtiut a deux, two to
two, preceded of a huissier, to the annient Hall. This solemn
procession has a little the air of a funereal convoy, and the Master
Treasurer, in black robe, resembles to a protestant pastor. The
advocates and the students, assembled in the hall, carry also some
Ma bits of mourning and hold themselves respectuously upright.
Arrived at the great table, we put ourselves all the long of
the step, as at the border of the grave, and the Master Pastor,
holding a book, commences to read a prayer. That has abso-
lutely the air of an interment. In habit, and at side of him, I

Why, of course, the Member always finds the victuals,
And the whole I. O. G. T. turn expectant eyes to me
To provide them with their summer beer and skittles.
Then the rector lets me know that his tithes have sunk so low

That unless those help who ran "ho will be a ruined man
And a bankrupt, with the bailiffs in possession.
As the Baptist Church is filled, they intend (D. V.) to build

While the Roman Catholic priest lets me know the very least
That will satisfy the Irish population.
Then the Sunday School, I hear, has an outing every year,
And my predecessor always sent the apples;
By the self-same post I learn, that the Independents yearn
To erect a pair of corrugated chapels.
And before I can decide how my favours to divide,
The Salvationists, with Hallelujah chorus,
Write that "We are marching down, and we hope to storm the

But we need the sinews for the fight before us."
Then the Clubs—with one consent they elect me President,

Then there come in scores the cranks, and I owe them little thanks

OTJB BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN relating The Adventures of the Comte de la Muette during
the Reign of Terror (BLACKWOOD), Mr. BERNARD CAPES does not
avail himself of any machinery in the way of a recovered box of
old letters or a supposititious diary. He plunges straightway
into his story, preserving throughout a marvellous rrniwmhlanrr.
He has evidently dived deep into the sea of personal record of
the times of which he treats, and brings back rich treasure.
A man 115 lurid side-lights thrown upon those terrible days, my
Baromte specially mentions the description of life in the prison
of the Little Force, with its almost hideous gaiety, its reckless
heroism of dainty cavaliers and high-born ladies. There are other
scenes, such as the trial in the Court at the Conciergerie, and the
flight through the quarries of Mpntrouge, that are of thrilling
interest, an undercurrent of grim irony relieving their tragedy.
If ever there were two novelists most unlikely to meet on com
mon ground, it would be CHARLES DICKENS and Mrs. HUMPHRY
WARD. Yet, in Mrs. WARD'S latest work, Helbeck of Bannis-
dale (SMITH. ELDER), there is a striking resemblance between the
character of Mr. Haredale in Barnaby Budge, and Mr. Alan
Helbeck of Bannisdale. Both are Catholics, the one living before,
the other after the repeal of the harsh persecuting laws
directed against the Romanists in Great Britain and Ireland;
Haredale defending himself as a Papist against Protestant aggres-

•ion, and being wounded on the forehead by a stone hurled at
him by some one in the "No Popery" mob; Helbeck, in a
similar position, set upon and wounded by a cowardly Westmore-
land gang. There is, too, a certain kind of resemblance between
the events that made both Haredale and Helbeck what they are
in the two stories. Mr. Haredale is one of the least exaggerated
of CHARLES DICKBNB'S characters, but Mrs. WARD'S Mr. Alan
Helbeck is a saintly personage, who has just stepped out of a
"light" in some painted window of a Gothic church, and has
accidentally left his "halo" behind him. He is an amateur
ascetic of preposterous piety, detached from all creature com-
forts except (thank goodness!) his quiet pipe of tobacco. And
then the atheistical girl Laura, who falls in love with, and who
is loved by this Painted Window Personage, is she a finished
portrait from life? Can either be considered as a type? The
atheistical young woman would like to become a Papist, in order
that she may marry Helberk (or say Heavenbeck) of the Painted
Window, but as she cannot arrive at this, she drowns herself.
Then Helbeck of the Painted Window is free to return to hit
"halo." if so inclined, and if the vacant space has not already
been filled up. Howevert as to his future career, Mrs. HUMPHRY
WARD charitably and artistically leaves us in considerable doubt.
If poor Ophelia-Laura could only have been resuscitated, and
both lovers been made into a couple of sensible people, and could
it all have ended in a happy marriage with the brightest prospect!
before them, then one half-hour of gentle melancholy, partially
relieved by a smile or two, would have been spared to Mrs.
WARD'S devoted admirer, THE BARON DB B.-W.

It MAKES A TERRIBLE NolSE."
John. "I DON'T THINK IT MAKES A NOISE, SIR CHARLES, BUT IT'S THE DISTRICT is so QUIET, SIR!"
THE CLUB WOMAN'S VADE MECUM.
Question. Is it your opinion that a spin-
ster should have all tie advantages of a
bachelor?
Answer. Certainly; and that opinion is
endorsed by modern legislation.
Q. You consider that the position of a
woman is as good as that of a man?
A. Yes, and better, for to the present
equality of the sexes she is able to add the
chivalrous superiority that has come to her
as a legacy from the past.
Q. You think you have a right to the
liberty enjoyed by your brothers?
A. Certainly; and intend to exercise it.
Q. In what manner do you assert your
freedom?
A. By living by myself in Chambers and
belonging to a Ladies' Club.
Q. What are the special advantages of
living by yourself in Chambers?
A. That I rid myself of the control ot
my mother and the rivalry of my sisters.
Q. And of belonging to a Ladies' Club?
A. That I can talk scandal with my
female fellow-members and smoke cigar-
ettps.
Q. Can you suggest any improvement
for Ladies' Clubs?
A. Well, some sny that they might be
made more cheerful by the admission of
male guests.
Q. Then the company of the inferior sex
is not ta be despised?
A. In moderation it may be desirable.
Q. Is there any particular advantage to
be obtained by the freedom you have se-
cured which could not be equally enjoyed
by residence in the home of your parents?
A. Latchkeys in the parental household
are the exclusive property of its male
members.
, Q. And how often do you use a latch-
key?
A. About once in twelve months.
Q. Then, although emancipated, you still
believe in propriety?
A. Unquestionably, and fail to see why
freedom should become, licence.
Q. Then you are perfectly satisfied with
your life of single blessedness (
A. Yes—theoretically.
Q. Why do you say theoretically?
,1. Because, as a practical woman, I am

OPERATIC NOTES.
Thursday.-ROSSINI's Opera, Il Barbiere di Siviglia (“in
Italian," too! Welcome little stranger!), always and for ever
charming. So refreshing, these delightful examples of "spoken
through the music.” And then the graceful melodies illustrating
every detail of the action from beginning to end! A fine singing
Figaro is Signor CAMPANARI, though, “if it's humour you want
-well, you won't get it from CAMPANARI.
Madame MELBA, who is not exactly an ideal Rosina, was in
fine voice, and literally brought down the densely-packed house,
which applauded her three songs in the celebrated music-lesson
scene." As to an encore ! she could have had five of them had
she so chosen.
M. SALEZA is but a shadow of what the dashing and amorous
Count Almaviva ought to be; appearing quite subdued in the
presence of so royal a Rosina as is Madame MELBA. It was,
perhaps, this feeling that made him careless as to his disguise, for
if Don Bartolo (capitally sung, but acted and made up as the
traditional old pantaloon, by M. CARBONE) had been only in the
slightest degree sharp, he would have recognised the Count in the
cossack of the music-master, as M. BONNARD, having effectually
changed his costume and his wig, had entirely omitted any facial
alteration, and was, consequently, rather more like himself than
ever. The argument may be, that, were the Count 80
perfectly disguised as to be unrecognisable (as undoubtedly he
ought to be), then how on earth could Rosina know that the
supposed music-master is only her lover masquerading as Don
Basilio's substitute ? I see only one way, he should wear a false
nose, a false beard and moustache, and the business of the stage

should be so arranged that, on his introduction to his pupil, he
should take the opportunity of Don Bartolo's back being turned

As to the various towns we visited since I last wrote,
they cannot be adequately described in a postscript. We
rode in a postscript-I mean a post-cart-from King Wil-

better go round the five hundred odd miles by train,
luggage being excessed on the cart at the rate of four-
pence a pound. Except for the fact that the half-caste
Jehus smoke vile tobacco the whole time, and their teams
of six mules do the “grand chain” at intervals, and you
have to start before sunrise, it is a drive distinctly worth
taking. Spreeuws, meerkats (spelling not guaranteed),
monkeys, euphorbias, wild geraniums, and ostriches are
among the fauna and flora to be seen on the road,

tacrt—the chance of writing, "Nobody's nose like my nose," and
this would be, just now, most suitable to the talented M. COQUELIN
when made up as the hero of the new play, Cyrano de Bergerac.
COQUELIN'S nose is the feature of the piece, as Cyrano de Bergerac,
but for this actor's prestige, would not have attained its present
success on its own merits. It is " talky," the "talk" being
neither particularly brilliant, nor assisting the piece in "getting
any forrarder." The play has only three fairly dramatic situa-
tions, of which the one that ought to have been the most powerful
is dismissed in a comparatively off-hand way; while about an
hour wasted on mere declamation, to the detriment of the action,
might be cut out with advantage if ever a translation of the
piece is attempted on the English stage. Who would play
Cyrano f IRVINO? Ahem! ALEXANDER? Perhaps. WYND-
HAM? Probably.
It is a queer character, this of Cyrano—poet, musician, singer,
hero, sober as a teetotaler, yet with a nose to which that of
Bardolph is by comparison a thing of naught. Why did
they not nickname this soldier-poet "Ovidiut Naso" f M.
COQUBLIN achieves a nasal victory over difficulties which are
of his own choice, and the author of the play, M. EDMOND
ROSTAND, has much to be thankful for. In the first page the
dramatist writes, '' C'eit a Fame de Cyrano (jue je voulait dfdier ce
poeme." Better would it have been for the play had he dedicated
it " a la lame de Cyrano," which could then have been usefully
employed in making several effective coupura. However, the
play here is not the thing so much as the character, which is a
mixture of Afercutii, Don Ccetar de Bizan, and the hero of All for
Her. Millie. MARIA LEOAULT, as Rtxme, the heroine "libre,
orpheline, et cousine de Cyrano," played very charmingly, her
method in the strong ;r scenes being occasionally Bernhardtistic.
JEAN COQUELIN (i.e., GOQUELIN caiet, and there are seven
"cadets" in the piece—it might be a game of golf !) was good in
the undistinguished part of Ragueneau, and M. YOLNT lived and
died an excellent Christian—which is saying a good deal for'any
one—while M. DESJAEDINS, as De Guiche, was what one of
DICXENS'S characters termed " massive and concrete." That M.
COQUELIN is thoroughly popular in London was proved by the
crowded houses and delighted audiences that went to improve their
acquaintance with the comedian and with the French language
at the same time.
A COCKNEY RHAPSODY.
[A critic in the Dai/it News accuw? artirts genially of ignorance in their
treatment of rural lubjecU, and declares that nearly every picture of work in
the hay or harvest field is incorrect.]
COME revel with me in the country's delights,
Its rapturous pleasures, its marvellous sights;
No landscape of common or garden I praise,
But Nature's strange charms that the painter pourtrays.
No Summer begins there, and Spring never ends,
It mingles with Autumn, with Winter it blends;
Its primroses bloom when the barley is ripe,
Amid its red apples the nightingales pipe.
There often the shadow falls southward at noon,
And sunrise is hailed by the pale crescent moon,
The sun sets at will in the east or the west,
In the grove where the cuckoo is building her nest.
There the milkmaid sits down to the left of the cow,
In harvest they sow, and in haytime they plough;
While mowers, in attitudes gladsome and blythe,
Impossible antics perform with the scythe.
There huntsmen in June after foxes may roam,
And horses unbridled go champing with foam;
From torrents by winter fierce swollen and high,
The proud salmon leaps in pirsuit of the fly.
Ah Nature! it 'a little—I own for my part—
I know of your face save as mirroured in art;
Yet vainly shall critics begrudge me that charm,
For a fellow can paint without learning to farm.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Egypt in 1898 (BLACxwopc), by G. W. STBKVKfB, is a brightly-
written account of a visit lately paid to that country. My
Baronite is under the impression that the work originally appeared
in the form of letters contributed to that sprightly little paper
the Daily Mail. It is as informing as it is interesting, and is
illustrated by some admirably reproduced photographs.
Two old friends, with brightened up faces, and looking un-
commonly handsome and as fresh as colour can make them, are
GILBERT ABECKETT'S Comic History of Rome and the second
volume of the Comic History of England (both from BEADBUKT,
AGNEW, & Co.), by the same author. Many a true word is here
spoken in jest, and it is a pity that a knowledge of this English
history according to ABEOKETT is not generally adopted by
examiners, as a most useful commentary on the serious records.
The pictures representing the notable characters and chief events
would impress themselves indelibly on the mind of the youthful
student, who would be requested by the judicious examiner to
correct whatever was incorrect in the costumes and accessories
which make JOHN LEECH'S illustrations, conceived in the vein
of genuine burlesque humour, things of beauty (certainly not
a few of LEECH'S ladies merit this distinction) and joys for ever.
Thus would the artistic faculties of the youthful aspirant be
encouraged, and h;s appetite for knowledge, even of the driest
kind, pleasantly whetted. THE BABON DE B.-W.
"SCENE IN COURT."
IN Kingsbury v. Howard, before Mr. Justice GORELL BARNES
and a special jury, Mr. CARSON, Q.C., in his cross-examination
of Dr. KINGSBURY, in the course of some questions concerning
hypnotism, asked the witness, "Can you do as well on weak-
minded men as on strong?"
Imagine the interest shown by the judge, leaders, briefed,
and briefless, in fact by every one in court as they awaited the
experienced doctor's reply!
"Some of my best experiments," said the witness, evidently
with a keen perception of the situation, "have been on the
members of the Manchester Bar."
"We will adjourn," said Mr. Justice OOKKLL BARNES, without
a second's hesitation.

everybody engaged being suddenly hypnotised by a plaintiff or
defendant as the case might be I What a scene of Sleeping

OLD AGE PENSIONS.
Exeunt omnes. But "the resources of civilisation are not
exhausted." By no means. With every post Mr. Punch is
inundated with suggestions, and while he finds it impossible to
print them all, he commends the following to the Cabinet to be
carefully studied before the next General Election.
"H. E. H." writes, "It ispreposterous to talk of providing
pensions for the aged poor. The poor are the only well-to-do
people in the country. They have no expenses—what do they
want with pensions? The really distressed class are the Boyal
Dukes, whose treatment is a national scandal. Why, Sir, some
of us have to keep up a position on £10,000 a year and even lets!"
"GRUB STEEET " considers the whole scheme " chimerical and
criminal. It pauperises the poor, ruins thrift, and undermines
self-dependence. Genius alone can accept such a provision
without being morally degraded. Then again, the amount pro-
posed is absurdly inadequate. Five shillings a week would be
of no use to me: it must be guineas at the very lowest."
"DOSSER," who dates from Terns Inbankmint, wants to know
"why e should giv o bob a weak ter chaps wot works coppers
an other innimys of sersyerty wen he aint got a tanner isself for
ter get a tuppiny rope."
On one particular Mr. Punch's correspondents are all agreed—
the utter absurdity of every scheme except their own. On other
points, i/n<it homines, tot eententias; and before the Cabinet can
satisfy every one they will have to discover how to give a pension
to each without giving one to all.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Era e Leandrn, the new opera by Signor
MANCINELLI, was well received on Mon-
day, when it made its first appearance in
London. It is neither great nor original,
hut it is distinctly pleasing; in fact, it
is MANCINBLLI under gentle influence of
WAGNER and MASCAGNI. Occasionally it
seemed as if, had he only dared to violate
the canons of the modern school, he would
have liked to indulge himself by writing a
"tuney-tune/" Apparently, when he had
nothing extra original to say, he tinkled
the brass loudly. In the last act, the
orchestration in combination with a
thunderstorm was a trifle overpowering.
Madame EMMA EAMES sang well, though
a little too lackadaisical for an emotional
heroine. Her Shell song, a kind of Wag-
nerian edition of "What are the Wild
Waves saying," was greatly applauded.
M. SALEZA, a most heroic Leander, seemed
a bit tired, but he has had a good time of
it this season as a tenjr of all work, and
lots of playing. As a Professor of Nata-
tion, his costume was strictly irreproach-
able. Evidently the Greeks of old bathed
in full costume. M. Plancon sang and
acted in his usually suave high-priestly
manner. The mounting was excellent,
and everything went without a hitch. The
classical chorus sang well together, their
appearance, especially the feminine por-
tion, being distinctly and quaintly antique,
whilst the men were more prehistoric than
heroic.
Thursday.~r-Thf following letter, which
has reached 85, Fleet Street, speaks for
itself : —
July, 1898.
GOOD MASTER PUNCH,—Or you might be
"bad" for aught I care, save that I wish
to conciliate you, and get your consent to
the publication of this letter. I have a
complaint, good Master Punch, a com-
plaint!
On Thursday, Henry the. Eighth, com-
posed by CamUle Saint-Saens, and written
by the Messrs. Detroyat and Silvestre.
was played for the first time in England
in Covent Garden. Naturally I was there
to see.
The curtain rose, and we were in a hall
of His Majesty's Palace in London. I
could not determine where. It might
have been (and probably was) that splendid
structure opposite Chancery Lane where
HENRY, had he lived in these days, might
have got his hair cut. Out of the window
was a capital presentment of Fleet Street
in the olden time. The courtiers discuss
with Don Gomez, the Spanish ambassador,
the gossip of the moment. The king is in
love with Anne Bohyn. He is getting a
divorce, and Buckingham is to be exe-
cuted. Then the king appears with Ca-
therine. They are followed by Anne
(smiling), and the chorus declare—to quote
from the Argument—" that France and
England are now one, seeing that the new
maid of honour has come direct from the
Court of CHARLES THE TWELFTH." Henry
creates Anne Marchioness of Pembroke.
Then Buckingham is heard without going
to his execution to the sound of military
music, suggestive of rather a sad Lord
Mayor's Show, and the curtain descends
—again I quote from the Argument—"as
Don Gomez realises that he loves Anne
in vain, while the others sing a solemn
rhorus on the subject of Buckingham's
doom." But there was a gap. Some one
was not there!
In the second act we are in Richmond
Park, with Henry and Anne, to put it
colloquially, "carrying on." The Papal
legate arrives to decide against the king,
when the monarch postpones further busi-
ness to join in a popular fete. The value
of the original, which included a present-
ment of the gathering of the Scottish
clans, was not given. It was indeed re-
grettable. Then there was another omis-
sion. There was a gap. Some one was
not there!
The third act passes in Westminster
Hall, where Catherine is tried. I quote
from the Argument. "The Papal legate
enters, and showing the Papal Bull, an-
nounces that the Pope declares the mar-
riage with Catherine lawful and valid.
Henry then nppeals to the people, and
asks if they will accept a foreign mandate.
On receiving a frantic negative, he consti-
tutes himself head of the Church of Eng-
land, and announces that he will take to
wife Anne Tiole.yn, Marchioness of Pem-
broke . The legate excommunicates Hen ry,
who always has a ready retort, and the
scene closes amid general enthusiasm and
rejoicing." But there was an omission.
There was a gap. Some one was not
there!
The opera—which I venture to declare
is in plot, music, and execution, admirable
—is brought to a close at Kimbolton,
where Anne and Henry meet in the death-
chamber of Catherine. But even then
there was an omission. There was once
more a gap. Some one again was not
there!
And now, good Master Punch, tell me
Hie name of the absentee. You cannot!
Then I will supply the information. 7 was
not there. I had been cut out. 7 had
been omitted. My king was there, but
not 7—7—7. Farewell, a long farewell to
all my greatne.ss.

I used to see her everywhere—
When I went out to crush or dance,
Twas ten to one that she 'd be there.
What dainty pictures I might draw,
If I had skill to paint or write,
And make you see her, as I saw—
The pretty girl I knew by sight I
Yet, on mature reflection, I
Will leave her portrait unessayed—
If you would know the reason why,
It might be lifelike, I'm afraid I
So whether she was fair or dark,
Or short or tall, are matters alight—
She was, I but again remark,
A pretty girl I knew by sight.
With unobtrusive interest
I watched her move through Fashion's
maze,
I saw her fair and sweet, possessed
Of none but "great and gracious ways."
To study her I simply sought
Alike "by sun and candle-light,"
To me she still continued nought—-
A girl I only knew by sight.
And "strangers yet," as HOTTOHTON sings,
We two for many months remained—
'Tis one of those peculiar things
Which never can be quite explained.
I hold that Kismet shapes our ends,
I said, "Whatever is, is ritdit:

'Twas much to know her e'en by eight.

And so at last, at last we met 1

She was my friend for half a day—
The girl I 'd known for months by sight.
Since then she 's vanished from my ken,
And I have haunted every place
Affected by my fellow-men,
Where I might hope to see her face.
I 've sought her everywhere in vain,
A very "phantom of delight,"
A phantom that appears again
To memory only, not to sight.
To meet her howsoe'er I pray,
It is not likely now, I know,
Because that memorable day
Was ages—quite a week—ago I

And Fate decrees, in my despite,
That I should know her now "by heart,"

BITRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 11.
-“So you are occupewing TOMMY BOWLES's
pie,” said SARK to Mr. GEDGE, finding him
once more ensconced in the coveted corner
seat above the Gangway.
Mr. GEDGE bent a searching glance upon
him. What might this suspicious com-
mingling of syllables portend? It was
only seven o'clock; but some men, es-
pecially in the City, dine early. ŠARK
thought he had better explain. An old
story; everybody knows it, every one but
Mr. GEDGE: the college Don who delights
a wide circle of friends by occasionally
mixing up his syllables; goes to church a
little late; finds a stranger in his pew.
“Beg your pardon,” he tumultuously says,
“but you 're occupewing my pie.”
Mr. GEDGE doesn't laugh. "I don't like
jokes made about a pew," he said. “You 'll
be speaking lightly of the pulpit next."
This by the way. Having secured the
coign of vantage, whatever we may call it,
Mr. GEDGE rises thence and wants to know
to which of Her MAJESTY's Ministers seated
below him he should address a question
about the Lord Chancellor's disposal of his
patronage. Which shall it be? Don't all
speak at once. They didn't. Only PRINCE

conveyed every syllable of it)"they

Mr. GEDGE began to wish he'd stayed at

whimpered that he had asked PRINCE
ARTHUR; that PRINCE ARTHUR had told
him to ask the Home Secretary; that he
had gone to the Home Secretary, who told

so much time on Wednesday: say, average
seven hours close work a day; and mind
you, the report stage of a Bill is the final
winnowing out. Been at it for days, even
weeks, on first reading, second reading,
and Committee stages.
Do you mean to say, facing this smiling,
childlike morn, trying to keep step with
this hard-headed milkman, that if we had
only the business of the Bill at heart, we
couldn't have comfortably, much more
effectively, have concluded our work at
the customary midnight hour?
"Instead of which," as the judge acutely
remarked, some three or four score of us
have been sitting up through a sultry night,
trying to keep ourselves awake as we dis-
cussed delicate points in the Bill. It had
to be finished at this sitting, lest a worse
thine befel. PRINCE ARTHUR, who is not
nearly so simple as he looks, dropped hint
that if we didn't achieve report stage there
must be a Saturday sitting. We pre-
tended not to hear; but the words stuck,
and so did we—at our task till it was
finished.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I read in the papers
that an "Arabian Baboon," which dis-
tinctly ejaculates "mama," has lately ar-
rived at the Zoological Gardens. This fact
conclusively proves to me that the word
with which children so fondly address their
mothers is of Simian origin, and distinctly
proves the Darwinian theory. Similarly,
I can only imagine that all Guinea Fowl,
with their cries of "Come back, come

primeval race-starters.

MR. J. W. ARROWSMITH, of Bristol, has had a happy though
More than a dozen years ago, when, as the preface to Th
Chamberlain Birthday Book puts it, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was th
rising hope of stern, unbending Radicalism, there was puhlishe(
under authority a volume of his public speeches. It has Ion
been out of print, and, tradition says, the sole copy with whic
the House of Commons library was endowed has been literal]
thumbed to pieces by Members in quest of pleasant reminder
for "JOE," that he did not always see matters from the point o
view of a Cabinet Council where he sits in company with Lor
SALISBURY and Lord HALSBURY. The Chamberlain Birthda
Book supplies the gap in pleasing ingenious fashion. M
CHAMBERLAIN'S pointed utterances on political questions an
situations uttered in unregenerate days, are remorselessly co
lated. Appositeness is given by the signature of the public ma
closely concerned facing each entry under proper date, after th
manner of the ordinary birthday book. For example, M
CHAMBERLAIN was born on July 8, 1836. His name is dul
entered, whilst on the page op'posite there appears the fo
lowing quotation from a speech delivered by him at Bridport o
October 1, 1885:—"That I should purchase place and offlc
by the abandonment of the opinions I have expressed, th;
I should put my principles in my pocket, and that I shou
onsent to an unworthy silence on those matters to which I have
rofessed to attach so great an importance, would be a degrada-
on which no honourable man could regard with complacency or
satisfaction." There are plums like this on every page of a little
ook that will give more than a shilling's-worth of pleasure in
amily circles.
Oh what a noble book! The Encyclopedia of Practical
Cookery (L. UPCOTT GILL), edited by THEODORE FRANCIS
BARRETT (bless him!), being "A Complete Dictionary of all
Dertaining to the Art of Cookery "—the noble Art, the greatest
f all the Arts!—" and Table Service." This is indeed tidings of
le greatest comfort and joy, sent down from the GARRETT above
LO the Kitchen beneath. THEODORE FRANCIS has been assisted in
lis noble and monumental work by WILLIAM A. RAWSON, Cook
nd Confectioner, who has helped to dish up many a Lord Mayor's
east—at least, so opines the Baron. This excellent book, this
genuine Cook's Guide, containing many a tour de force, is^in two
olumes, each as big as the conventional "Family Bible." The
magnum opus "teems," if the Baron may be permitted the ex-
ression, copyrighted by one of his estimable colleagues, with
.lustrated information. And, indeed, where, in a civilised state
nd age, is the use of even the very best cooking, unless you
have " plates"? These plates are provided by HAROLD FUBNISS
"FuRNiss"—name suggesting a combination of kitchen fires
and grills), by GEOKOE CRUIKSHANK (name recalling HARRISON
AINSWORTH'S Historical Romances, illustrated, which told of
Jog Magog, and their Gargantuan feasts), W. MUNN ANDREW
a good MUNN this), and others. Eight chefi de cuisine have
assisted, aided by two confectioners, in the making of this work,
and too many chefs have not spoilt the book. Au contraire. How
appetising even to write about such dainty dishes! Let us rejoice
and smack our lips! Let us read it day by day, devoting an hour
per diem to its study, and to the thorough digesting of it. No
lousehold troupe should be without it. The first word in Vol. I.
s " Abat-faim, French literally for a hunger-reducer," and hence
t comes to mean the piece de resistance, something at which, and
nto which, you can " cut and come again." This Cookery Book
s an appetiser, and an " Abat-faim." First it makes you yearn
without being too hungry, then it teaches you how to satisfy
,'our yearning, yet not to gorge. And the last word is " Zwei-
backen," i.e., twice cooked cakes, to be eaten as dry biscuit, just
to assist the wine-tasting: and so it ends. The spirit of liberality
pervades the compilation, as is evident from the following wise
md generous concession—'' Should garlic be objected to, it may be
omitted." It is impossible summarily to dismits this work.

THE ARMY SURGEON'S VADE MECUM.
Question. On joining the army, had you
more than one qualification?
Answer. I had two, my knowledge as a
scientist and the ordinary education of an
officer. I had to become acquainted with
military law, and other learning proper to
one assuming command.
Q. On joining the service, how were
you treated?
A. Scarcely to my satisfaction, for al-
though I had my military qualification, that
speciality was ignored, and I was called
Burgeon this or surgeon that.
Q. Can you give a reason for this f
A. It was alleged that I was not a
combatant officer, and consequently had
no right to the privileges of my comrades.
Q. As a matter of fact, did you not per-
form the duties of a combatant officer?
A. The many Victoria Crosses gained
by the Army Medical Department is a
sufficient answer.
Q. "Were there other officers who be-
longed to a department as you did?
A. Yes, there were paymasters, and
officers undertaking the transport of stores.
0. And were they called Pay Captains
and Transport Majors?
A. No: which made it the harder for
Brigade-Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonels.
Q. But yon are talking of the past;
now about the present? Has anything
been done to imorove the status of Army
Medicol Officers?
A. Yes: the prefix of "Surgeon" has
been abolished, so that row a militarv
doctor mav pay a visit without the fear
of being announced as a Sergeant-Major.
Q. Has this measure trivon saHsfaption p
A. Very (rrenfc satisfaction, for it hn°
removed a grievance, and paved *he road
to the best men flnckin" to the colours.
Q. .And whnt will be the probable result p
A. That the member* of the Roy.-'l
Medics' Corns will in future be as conspi-
cuous for their scientific attainments a?

and devotion to duty.

HEMISPHERES I HAVE "EXTENDED" OVER.
(By a, late Cambridge Lecturer "inpartibus.")
II.—THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.
(Continued.)
POESIOPOLIS is a fenced watering-place
in primeval forest of pine and maple-syrup
on borders of first-class lake. For poll-tax
of one-quarter dollar per diem, municipa-
lity lights the sylvan ways with electricity,
waters roads, and supplies lectures. No
further charge for programme of day,
pinned on forest-trees. In this chaste re-
treat, free from frivolities of other holiday
resorts frequented by the "summer girl,"
may be found physical rest and mental
refreshment at above trifling charge.
Cheap excursion-trains bring out the
teeming population of Cultureville, one
drawing-room car being always reserved
for members of the Browning Society.
Immediately upon my arrival (after some
twenty-four hours on American soil) was
assaulted by series of female peace-corre-
epondents all demanding my "picture,"
together with account of my views on the
working of the United States Constitution.
Assured them all of my high appreciation of
the iced drinks of the country. "And now,"
said one young Canadian reporteresB, whose
antipathy to the States I had been cleverly
flattering (the alliance not having been
yet consummated), "and now, just Ml me
something startling!" Could have told her
several very startling things, not all suit-
able for publication, but confined myself
to expression of opinion that this was one
of the nicest Hemispheres I had ever come
across.
Thermometer standing at some three
figures Fahrenheit in shade, was allowed
to demonstrate methods of Cambridge
University Extension in open-air temple,
popularly supposed to resemble Parthe-
non. This offered lawless opportunities
to itinerant Kodak-demons, who did not
hesitate to snap me through the temple-
columns in midst of rapt oration. Found
this very trying to modesty. Lake, how-
ever, afforded still more deadly facilities to
prurient curiosity. Was in habit of pub-
licly diving from prominence overhanging
water. Met a gentleman lately returned
fr^m mother-country to whom my figure
seemed familiar, though I did not remember
to have set eyes on him before. Facts
transpired as follows. His vessel, arriving
off Sandy Hook, was met by tender bringing
out Customs officials and newspapers. First
object that rivetted his attention in leading
New York journal was picture of athletic
fig-jre projected in mid-air over inland sea.
Underneath ran terse legend : •—"Professor
, of Great "Britain" (mentioning my
name), "dives into the lake at Poesiopolis!"
Confess to having felt in some degree
shocked at first, but have since understood
th it this illustration contributed not a
little to subsequent friendly relations be-
tween the two countries.
Intellectual enlightenment being sole
reason for existence of Poesiopolis, which
is deserted during close season for culture,
no intoxicating drinks were to be pur-
chased within the town-walls, nothing, in
fact, besides those apparently innocuous
mixtures that eventually disfigure diges-
tive organs beyond all possible recognition.
As evil fortune would have it, the environ-
ment to a radius of fifteen miles was a
"dry" district, conforming to law* of
Local Veto. Complained bitterly to
friendly native of having to steam such a
long distance down lake in search of a
workmanlike drink. Thirst generally dis-
appeared before it could be quenched.
"Don't you make any mistake," he
said, "_about these 'dry' districts. You
cross right away to that hotel opposite—
matter of mile-and-a-half or two mile—ask
for Room 13, and see that you get it."
Rapidly took ship to haven where 1
would be. Entering hotel I advanced to
manager and said, "I want to drink."
"Ginger-beer and lemonade in Room 13,"
he replied. A little shaken in my confi-
dence, I proceeded to Room 13, and
caught the barman's eye. "Can I get
anything intoxicating to drink here PI
asked, plaintively. "Ginger-beer and
lemonade," he replied. "Then I will
trouble you," I said, "for a couple of
sherry-cobblers, if you please." Without
another word he mixed and served the
beverage named.
Have since learned that there are no
more contented people in States than
inhabitants of " dry" districts. All parties
pleased. Teetotalers, because they have
passed law against sale of intoxicating li-
quors; drinkers, because nobody keeps it.
But to pass by easy and natural transi-
tion from subject of dry districts to that
of my lectures—" The Epic of Sordello."
Local Secretaries of University Extension
Centres in England have often expressed
to me their apprehension that mere name
of BROWNING would frighten nervous peo-
ple from attending my courses. Was once
tempted to meet difficulty by calling the
subject "TENNYSON," and see how long I
could lecture on BROWNING before I was
found out.
But all rest of BROWNING upside-down
is child's play to Bordello. Statistics show
that not more than one in every three
hundred thousand inhabitants of the Brit-
ish Isles have ever even >aid that they had
perused it; and of these only 1.85 per cent,
could prove that they understood as many
as six consecutive lines of the work.
Under these circumstances, had felt myself
well-advised in giving to my course the
title, "On Some Alleged Difficulties in
BROWNING'S Epic of Sordetto."
In first two lectures; result of devotion
of large part of life-time, I endeavoured
to elucidate the vexed and intricate Italian
history of period in which hero figured.
At end of second lecture, was privately
rebuked by lady in audience. "Professor
," she said, "we wish you would not
tell us things we know already. We wish
you would just get on to the Book. There
are lovely things in the Book!" In vain I
protested that I had supposed extremely
obscure background of poem needed illumi-
nation. "Why, no," she said, "you don't
teach us anything we didn't know before.

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.
"'ERE, ARCHER, TER SADDLE'S HON THE WRONG WAY!"
"WELL, AN' 'OWDOER KNOW WHICH WAY I'M COIN', EH?"
We want you just to get on to the Book.
There are lovely things in the Book." Mut-
tering words of astonishment at the stand-
ard of culture in the States, I assured her
I would get on to the Book without further
delay. By my fourth lecture had become
absolutely incomprehensible—to my audi-
ence, as I imagined; to myself, as I knew.
Could not readily believe that any one
would be found hardy enough to attend
the fifth. Meanwhile, met my critic.
"Professor -," she said, and a fine light
of intelligence played in her speaking eyes,
"let me thank you for your <fe-licious last
lecture I" "I was afraid," I modestly in-
terposed, "that you might have found it
a little stiff. You have our word 'stiff'?"
I added. "Why, certainly," she said.
"We are vurry cultured, and we have all
your be.it slang. A de-licious lecture, Sir!"
At close of my course, was recipient of
irany adulatory expressions, one of which so
striking that I bear the marks of it to this
day. Should perhaps have mentioned that,
if I have a fault, it is an over-sensitive
modesty. After final lecture was accosted
by young and not unpleasing female.
"Professor ," she said, "I want to
shake hands with you." Replied in tones
of ennui that she was at liberty to do so.
"I want to tell you right here," she con-
tinued, "that you are my idea of Daniel
De-rondo/" "Why," I said, "I thought
he was a prig!" "I guess not," she
replied; "I guess Daniel De-rcmda was
just fine!"
Had my doubts of young woman's inten-
tions; and left quite early next morning
en route for Eastern Hemisphere.
LAST OPERATIC NOTES.
ONE of the Last Nights. Sad things,
"last nights," and we were in melancholy
mood. "Before another week be out,
'Ichabod' will be written over the doors
of the Opera." "Indeed 1". said a languid
habitue of the Opera, to whom this remark
was made, suddenly becoming alert on the
chance of picking up a trifle in the way
of "latest news." "Ikibod?" he re-
peated, evincing considerable curiosity;
is that a new Opera P Are they going to
extend the season? Funny name, Ikibod.
Who's it by?" On so limited an intelli-
gence explanation is thrown away. He
was referred to the daily papers. Doubt-
less ere now he has learnt all that can be
known about Ichabod.
Thursday.—The house to-night crammed
full; new men and old places. Conductor
MANCINELLI looks anxiously towards the
omnibus, but his fine eye in frenzy rolling
is unable to detect the presence of any
me occupying the box seat. The accident
to H.R.H. is the general topic of conversa-
tion, and those among the audience who
are informed by some "in the know" that
the Prince, in his own room at Marlborough
House, is thoroughly enjoying the Opera
in an Electrophpnic way, are much relieved
and greatly delighted. The effect on the
singers is apparent. In order to be re-
produced Electrophonically, they all sing
put, and do their very best. M. RENAUD
is every way admirable as Don Giovanni;
EDOUARD DE RESZKE, something between
Vigarn and Don Basilio, "the friend in-
knee'd," is at his drollest as Leporello;
M. BONNARD is apparently a sweet-singing
Hamlet, in a "suit of sables" and hat t«
match, of most gentlemanly manners;
M. GILIBERT, representing in Masetto what
Joe the Fat Boy in Pickwick probably
looked like on reaching thirty years of
age, or thereabouts, is decidedly comic;
Madame NOBDICA, admirable as Donna
Anna, with just a soupcon of Lucrezia
Borgia in her grand style; SUZANNE ADAMS
singing charmingly and acting skittishly
as the undecided Donna Elvira; and
Mile. ZELIE DB LUSSAN, a delightfully co-
quettish Zerlina, who already shows sure
indications of developing into a Carmen,
purringly soothes the jealous, flabby Fat
Boy Masetto. What the Commendatore
was like when alive, we are not in a posi-
tion to say. The poor gentleman was
killed before our arrival, and we could not
stay to supper merely to meet his Ghost-
ship. Fire MOZART! Where's your
Warbling WAGNER now?
Monday and Tuesday's opera will be too
late for our report, so practically this, to
3/r. Punch's Operatic Representative, is
the last night of a season which may be
taken as satisfactory to the Higgins-de-
Qrey-Faber Syndicate, to Manager MAU-
RICE GRAU, and Mr. NEIL FORSYTE their
most civil-servica secretary. All singers
have done their best during a season not
lemarkable for brilliancy: Mile. BAUER-
HEISTEB quite recovered; and should
Madame EMMA EAHES deny that she has
been all along in excellent voice, why—
"she is a Storey."

THE other Sunday afternoon I rode over on my bicycle to see
the ROBINSONS. They live seven miles away. TOMKINB and

always seem pleased to see a fellow creature, hut RoiiiNgON and
his wife are unusually hospitable and good-natured. After I had

playing croquet, a game which requires vast muscular strength.
However, he said that his tyres were something quite new, and
that in one minute one man, or even one child, could stick one
postage-stamp, or anything of the sort, over that puncture and
mend it. So all the rest of us and the butler, principally the
butler, who is an expert in bicycles, went at it vigorously, and
after we had all worked for nearly an hour the tyre was patched
up, and ToMKtxs, having finished his game, rode coolly away. I
was g ing to do the same, but ROBINSON wouldn't hear of it—I
must stay to dinner. I said I had no lamp for riding home in the
dark. He would lend me his. I said I should have to dine in
knickerbockers. That didn't matter in the country. So I stayed
till 9.30.
The next Sunday I rode over again. I started directly after
lunch, lest I should seem to have come to dinner, and I gave the
butler that lamp directly I arrived. But it was all no good, for
I stayed till 10, and had to borrow it again. "Bring^ it back to-
morrow morning," said ROBINSON, "and help us with our hay-
making." Again dined in knickerbockers.
On Monday I resolved to be firm. I would leave by daylight.
Rode over early. After some indifferent haymaking and some
excellent lunch, I tried to start. No good. EOBINSON carried
me off to a neighbour's tennis-party. After we returned from
that, he said I must have some dinner. Couldn't ride home all
those seven miles starving. Knickerbockers didn't matter. Again
dined there and rode home at 10.30.
So I still have ROBINSON'S lamp. Now I want to know how
I am going to get it back to his house. If I have it taken by
anybody else he will think I don't care to come, which would be
quite a mistake. Have vowed that I will not dine there again
except in proper clothes. If I cross his hospitable threshold,
even before breakfast, I shall never get away before bedtime.
Can't ride seven miles in evening dress before breakfast even in
the country. Besides, whatever clothes I wore, I should never
be able to leave by daylight. I should still have his lamp.
Can't take a second lamp. Would look like inviting myself to
dinner. So would the evening clothes at breakfast. What is to
be done?

A TERRIBLE ADVENTURE.
(Evidently intended for the W. W. Magazine.)
DEAR SIR,—When I was at the Bhilberry Hill Station in India,
I was aroused one night by a ferocious snorting underneath my
bed, which was, as is usual in those parts, covered by mosquito
curtains—the mosquitoes being, with the natives, the chief
plagues of the district. Trembling with anxiety, not fright, I
recognised the sound to proceed from a well-known Man-Eating
Tiger, badly wanted by the Shekarries in those parts. At the
same time the mosquitoes in swarms continued to buzz rapaciously
about my couch. An idea came to me. I softly drew aside the
curtains, and giving a low whistle on the right side, stepped out
on the left of my mattress. The tiger and the noxious insecte
apparently entered together into my sleeping-place. Anyway,
we found the body of the monarch of the jungle punctured by
the blood-suckers in a thousand different spots, and dead as the
cold mutton into which he would, but for my presence of mind,
have no doubt converted

THE chief topic in the Temple just at
present is, of course, the jrreat action
Sharper v. Diddleitm, the hearing of which
occupied the whole of last week. The
concluding speech of the Attorney-General
for the Plaintiff was a magnificent effort,
and the exquisite flute-solos with which
the learned gentleman interspersed his
remarks are thought to have contributed
greatly to the verdict which he secured
for his clients; several of the jury were
visibly affected by them, and the learned
judge himself seemed to find some diffi-
culty in playing the "Selection from II
Travatore" upon his cornet, with which
he prefaced his summing-up.
Some impatience is expressed by the
parties interested in (lint important com-
mercial action Codlin v. Short, as judg-
ment, which was reserved at the hearing
of the case two months ago, has not yet
been delivered. But we understand that
Sir WILLIAM ORPHEUS is still engaged in
netting his lengthy judgment as a recita-
tive, in the Wagnerian style, with full
orchestral accompaniment, and that its
impres<nveness when thus delivered will
more than atone for any delay there may
have been.
There are various rumours of impending
changes upon the judicial bench, and a
large number of names are mentioned in
connection with possible vacancies. Mr.
T. BOWLING, Q.C. (whose recent perform-
ance in an Admiralty case of " A Life on
the Ocean Wave" was such a success), has
a voice which eminently qualifies him for
a judgeship; and, again, Mr. RATAPLAN'S
skill upon the kettle-drums surely marks
him out as a future Master of the Rolls.
There has been some cavilling at the last
appointments, which is only natural when
men are chosen whose only merit is a
knowledge of law, and who are most in-
efficient as musicians—a point of infinitely
greater importance.
We hear that an unusually large number
of men were "ploughed" at the last Inns-
of-Court examination, owing to the high
standard demanded by the examiners in
Harmony and Counterpoint. Some of the
Indian students are petitioning the nutho-
rities to be allowed to take up the "tom-
tom" as their instrument for the "prac-
tical music" part of the examination. It
is also suggested that a concert might
suitably be given in Hall on "call-night"
by those who have especial musical talent.
The litigant in person is always trouble-
some, but one who appeared the other day
met with a speedy rebuff. On attempting
to strengthen his somewhat faulty argu-
ments by a violin-solo, the learned judge
speedily caught him tripping, and, ob-
serving that such defective bowing clearly
amounted to contempt of Court, com-
mitted him to prison for a week.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTKACTBD FROM THB UlAHY OP TOUT, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Jvly 18.
—It wag the Pariah Fire Engines Bill
that led Dr. TANNER astray. Had sat
through sultry night restive but inarticu-
late. Had listened to debate on suspen-
sion of Twelve q'Clock Rule, his volcanic
bosom temporarily soothed by spectacle
of that great Constitutionalist . I KM MY
l.ou j iu:it protesting against breach of
law by mean device of calling it "sus-
pension of the Rule." Had refrained
from taking part in debate on third reading
of Irish Local Government Bill, though
his lip curled when he beheld Colonel
SAUNDERSON and JOHN DILLON falling on
each other's neck and weeping tears of
joy because it had passed. Had listened
with puzzled air whilst Chancellor of the
Exchequer explained intricacies of pro-
posed Colonial Loans Fund. Found a
little mental and physical refreshment in
voting on Universities and College Estates
Bill—or was it the College Estates and
Universities Bill, or was it Coliversities
and Unledge Estates Bill? Not quite cer-
tain; fancied, as tliere was undoubtedly
estates in it, it had something to do with
Death Duties. However that be, as only
a few seemed going into Lobby against
third reading, the Doctor joined them.
Then, before you knew where you were,
the Statute Law Revision Bill passed
through Committee and went bang through
third reading. Isle of Man Customs Bill
read a second time; Telegraph (Money)
Bill passed through Committee and nobody
asked for change; Metropolitan Police
Courts Bill read a third time. Where
would they stop? Be a revolution or at
least a Septennate, if we don't look out.
"Parish Fire Engines Bill!" Clerk at
Table called out.
SPEAKER left Chair. "Gone to fetch
the Fire Engine," said the Doctor to him-
self. Soothing prospect at midnight, with
the thermometer not far off eighty. Hose
just sort of thing to freshen you up before
going to bed.
Looking round again, the Doctor found
House in Committee; Chairman at his
post and CALDWELL on his legs. What
with disappointment at turn things had
taken—no parish fire engine, unless you re-
gard CALDWEI.L in that light—the Doctor
rose and made few remarks. Chairman
objected that they were not by any visible
means connected with Parish Fire Engines.
TANNER would soon put that right. On
again for another five minutes.
"Order! Order!" cried Chairman,
sternly. "The hon. Member is not
speaking to the amendment. 1 must call
upon him to discontinue his speech."
This an attack on freedom of debate that
must be resisted. From the Chairman he
would appeal to the Chair itself.
"Mr. LOWTHER," he shouted, "I appeal
to the Chair."
"Order I Order 1" said the Chairman in
ominous tones.
A propos of Parish Fire Engines, there
here flashed on Dr. TANNER'S mind recol-
lection of famous episode in BURKE'S Par-
liamentary career. Read in the papers
somewhere that Squire EDWARD LAWSON
still retains at Hall Barn the dagger he
picked up off floor of the House when
HVHKK flung it down. TANNER hadn't a
dagger about his person, not even a lancet,
but he had copy of Orders of the Day. So,
riling to full height and striding forth, he

Shade of Charles the First (on a nocturnal ramble through the Palate of Westminster). "Ix>rd Pro-

There is the mellow voice, the insinuat-
ing smile, the slight interrogative turn of
flung papers on the floor and passed out
under the gaping doorway.
Back again after a few minutes. On
proposal being made to read a third time
the Habitual Inebriates Bill, the Doctor
sternly shouted "No." Members made all
the more haste to hurry the Bill on to the
Statute Book.
Business done.—Quite a lot.

tures of SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, have
often been puzzled at half-felt conviction
that he reminds me of something, or

putting the question, "How do you feel

Disclosure flashed on the mind during
debate on Vaccination Bill. The SAOE is
proud to represent a constituency that
never bared the arm to the operator.
Their attitude on the question is altogether
negative. Not only will they not be vac-
cinated; they will not pay the fine for
breach of the law. SAGE not a man given
to boasting; but he could not restrain ring
of triumph in his voice, or flush of pride
mounting his brow, when he enlarged on
the negativeness of Northampton.
In the course of his remarks, his eye rest-
ing on the portly figure of the President

of the Local Government Board, the in-
stincts of the family doctor irresistibly de-
clared themselves.
"I should like to know," he said, drop-
ping his head a little on one side, "when
the right hon. gentleman was last vaccina-
ted?'^
This a personal question CHAPLIN might
have refused to answer; might even
have resented. But the spell was wound
about him. If the SAGE had added, "Put
out your tongue," he would straightway
have obeyed. As it was he meekly an-
swered, "Not very long ago."
That wouldn't do. Suddenly dropping
his suave manner, Dr. LABBY sternly said,
"It is so long ago, that he does not re-
member. We ought to have him exam-
ined."
CHAPLIN furtively looked towards door-
way to see if path were clear. Happily for
him the Doctor's eye fell upon another
patient. "Here is my right hon. friend,
the Member for Wolverhampton," he said,
bringing HENRY FOWLER to the front, as
it were by the ear. "How often has my
right hon. friend been vaccinated?"
Again the enquiry might have been
many hours' work at high pressure might
reasonably be supposed they would gladly
go for a stroll or a ride in the Park on
their way home to dress for dinner. On
the contrary, knowing that Criminal Evi-
dence Bill is to the fore in the Commons,
th-jy crowd down to Westminster, throw
themselves into the verbal fray with zeal
that could not be exceeded if each man's
copy of the Orders of the Day were marked
250 guineas, with pleasing prospect of
refreshers. Mere laymen meekly stand
aside leaving the Court free to the bar-
risters.
Pretty to see how gravely they differ
from each other, just as if they were in
Court, as if the SPEAKER were "my lud,"
the twelve Members scattered on benches
below gangway the jury. Only difference
is that, whereas in Courts of Law a gen-
tleman in wig and gown, not seeing eye
to eye with his learned brother, decisively,
almost triumphantly, snaps forth the points
of dissent, here, when an honourable
and learned Member does not agree with
his brother man, he is almost melted to
tears whilst gently expressing his pre-
sumptuous views.

evaded. If vaccination at the moment re-
mained compulsory, answer to such en-
quiry in such circumstances was not.
But the ex-Lord of the Indies, in manner
meeker even than the President of the
Local Government Board, answered, "Four
times."
"Very well, then," said the gratified
medico; "he need not be vaccinated
again."
So pleased wag he that he quite forgot
CHAPLIN'S shortcoming, and, being on his
legs, returned to discussion of the Bill be-
fore thn House.
Business done.—Report stage of Vacci-
nation Bill. At seven o'clock Minister in
Charge swore he would ne'er consent to
abandon compulsion; at 10.30 PRINCE
ARTHUR consented.

having a rare night's holiday, went out to

"Sir," said EDWARD CLARKE, looking as
if he were going to a funeral, "it is with

The Attorney-General's manly bosom
heaved in response a sigh of regret. His
head drooped; his eyes half closed; his
low ir lip quivered; and over his face stole
a beatific look of Christian resignation and
brotherly forgiveness.
_ As for BOB REID, who never found it in
his heart to differ from any one (except
the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD), he compromised
the matter by declining to support the
amendment, whilst affirming his intention
of, in practice, adopting its principle.

one looking on and listening felt he was
getting a Tot of good.

"THESE AKE MORE WAYS OP KILLING A Doo THAN HANGING HIM.'
DARBY JONES AT COWES.
"WHAT the deuce is he doing in that
galley?" will probably be your Gallic
inquiry, Honoured Sir, on perceiving that
I write this epistle from the Garden Island
of England. Tedious explanation would
occupy too much of your Space and too
much of my Time. Suffice it to say that
the Honourable FLIFLATT, of Oxford Col-
lage, having benefited very Considerably
by my Advice and Experience at Good-
wood, has very considerately, and I may
say generously, invited Captain KKITRRION
and myself to be his guests on board of
the yacht Sea Nipper, which he has hired
for a fortnight from Lord PEROT KOGNACK,
the Marquis of BBANDTWINB'S son, an Aris-
tocrat whose ill-luck at the Ducal Meeting
his necessitated a temporary retreat to
Boulogne, in lieu of joining the Heir-
Apparent and the Host of the Royal Family
on the health-bestowing waves of the So-
lent. When I add that Lord PEROT not
only transferred the yacht and her crew,
but also all the Provisions and Wines with
which she had been liberally provided on
credit, you may readily imagine that we
are in Clover, if such an expression be
VOL. cxv.
permissible anent the Briny Ocean, instead
of in Sea-weed.
I cannot say that I am much taken with
Yacht-racing, perhaps because KBITEBION
had me in a most Unjustifiable way on the
opening day of the Regatta. A vessel—I
don't know her name and don't want to—
passed the Winning Post or Winning Boat,
or whatever they call it, many lengths
ahead of the second. "A fiver," I ex-
claimed, "on the yacht with the red and
white flag!" "Done," cried the Captain.
But alas! later on I had to part with Five
of the Best to KUITEKION, whom I couldn't
persuade to take a Bill at Three Months.
It seems in this blessed (I use. the adjec-
tive sarcastically) Boat-racing there is a
beastly thing called "Time-Allowance," a
sort of Weight-for-Age the other way
round that the Judge puts on and takes off
by seconds and minutes, with the Agility
of a Conjurer. There 's no First Past the
Post on the Cowes Course.
However, I managed to recover my lost
money with an extra Fiver from FLIFLATT
on the next day. He was talking about a
little Watering-place on the Hampshire
Coast called Lee-pn-Solent. Having been
studying an Admiralty chart in the morn-
ing I immediately offered to bet him ten
pounds that Lee was not on the Solent,
it is needless to say that he at once ac-
cepted the wager, and the stakes were
deposited with KBITERION. At least, FLI-
FLATT handed over a Tenner, and I my
word, which was just as good, knowing
that I had a Certainty. 1 then sent for
the Map and clearly demonstrated that the
Solent does not begin till the Channel U
West of Southampton Water. FLIFLATT
parted with very bad grace, and retired to
his cabin in the sulks. KBITEBION, when he
had reluctantly paid me, ordered a boat
and went ashore, saying he had an impor-
tant appointment at the London Club.
He came back to dinner in High Feather.
"That was a good Tip of yours about the
Solent," he observed. "I've been backing
it all the afternoon." Justly indignant, I
claimed Halves, but he merely winked the
other eye. Such is Human Ingratitude,
the Offspring of Sordid Nature and Con-
genital Dishonour.

OUR BOOKING-OPEICE.
IN ZACK, Australia seems to have found her BRET HABTK.
Life is Life, which gives its name to the notable series of
stories just issued from the House of BLACKWOOD is, in its
camp-life scenes, closely akin to BRET HARTB'B earlier work. It
throbs with vigorous life, and has many intimate touches of
local colour. But my Baronite infinitely prefers the much
briefer story of Australia, "The Failure of FLIPPERTY." ZACK'R
personal acquaintance is not confined to Australasia. He knows
Germany, Italy, his heart, untravelled, fondly turning to Devon-
shire which, my Baronite suspects, was his early home. For
boldness and originality of conception, for vivid presentation of
character, through all an undercurrent of the laugh that is not
far removed from a cry, nothing to beat this book haa lately
appeared. These qualities find their fullest development in the
story of "The Red Haired Man's Dream."
"Q" has planted himself in a fresh corner, where, my Baronite
hopes, he wifl soon be picking up gold and silver. He has founded,
and edits, The Oornuh Magazine, a sixpenny monthly that will
gratify a public beginning to be tired of the fripperies, freaks,
and monstrosities just now popular with other sixpenny maga-
zines. As the title indicates, Mr. QUILLEB COUCH'S new venture
is designed specially for Cornishmen. But his net, deftly made
and widely flung, will catch other fish than pilchards. The
first Number is admirably done, " Q" contributing a weird story
which boldly brings the Wandering Jew on the Cornish coast in
quite novel circumstances.
In order to thoroughly enjoy Mr. ANTHONY HOPE HAWKINS'
Rupert of Hentzau (ARROWSMITH) , it is advisable to go in for a
few days swashbucklerish sort of training, and to imagine your-
self living among daringly reckless cavaliers of the doublet,
trunks, and high-boots style, wearing some sort of Austrian
uniform, and moving in old foreign towns badly lighted and
badly policed, yet with all the advantages to hand of modern
telegraphs and railways. I do not remember the telephone being
employed in this romance, but then neither his hero nor heroine
had any particular occasion for it. Also, while reading Mr.
ANTHONT HOPE'S stirring romance, you should ever and anon half
draw ycur sword and send it back with a clang into its scabbard,
taking care at intervals between the chapters to look to your
revolvers and carefully to examine such small side arms as you
may have about you. Thus equipped, accompany Fritz ron
Tarlenheim and old Sapt in all their adventures undertaken for
the sake of their friend Rudolf Rassendyll, and in defence of

the honour of his friend's true ladye-love Queen Flavia, wife of
the King whose health "had been shattered by the horror and
rigours of his imprisonment in the Castle of Zenda," as was
told in the previous romance, of which this is the continuation and
the finish. But is it by any means the finish? True, RassendyU
is dead, and so are all the most important enemies whose know-
ledge of the secret might be used for harm. But Mr. ANTHONY
HOPE has left one old woman alive, the mitchievoui Mother Holp,
who, if she only becomes a tool in unscrupulous hands, is
capable of doing a lot of mischief. The Baron, in the interests
of the Kingdom of Ruritania and the House of Elphberg, will
keep an eye on Mother Holp and that very uncertain and im-
pressionable young nobleman, the Count of Risckenheim. "It
may be," quoth ANTHONY HOPE, letting a saving clause into his
penultimate page, "that some day the whole story shall be
told, and men shall judge of it for themselves." Aha! then good
ANTHONY hath still a king up his sleeve. Nous verrons, as they
say in Ruritania. A more stirring romance, with interest ad-
mirably sustained from the very first page to the last, than Rupert
of Hentzau, it would be difficult to name. It is so artistically
contrived a sequel as to have special interest for those who de-
lighted in The Prisoner of Zenda, though, at the same time, it is
so perfect a story in itself, that the enjoyment of this work is
not marb to depend on any knowledge of the former novel.
"That we shall hear more of Ruritanian affairs is still with us

Being a Variation of Water-on-thc-Brain.
You ask me how it is that I
Am hardly ever found agreeing
With simple views that satisfy
An ordinary human being;1
Sir, I have principles at stake;
I do it all "for CONSCIENCE' sake."
When great reforms are in the air
That touch the health of half a nation,
I and my trusty gang are there
Primed with a deadly emendation;
And into really useful laws
We shove a little CONSCIENCE clause.
Of all the days of all the year,
Those are the merriest and maddest
When Members lean a stricken ear
To list the fulminating faddist;
(Such is the rather vulgar name
For men of conscientious aim).
And when in tones polite but firm
We execute a fluty chorus,
Mighty majorities will squirm
And lick the very dust before us;
It's CONSCIENCE !—that is why they crawl;
It makes such cowards of them all* I
Take Vaccination—one could weep
Hot briny tears of pure revulsion
To think that men should want to keep
The country healthy by compulsion 1
0 England! peopled by the free,
Where is your boasted Liberty?
Breathes there a man with soul so dead,
So lost to reason and morality,
Who would not freely give his head
Rather than check our high mortality?

A smile upon my pitted face!
Small-pox I Our fathers braved the thing;
True courage they were never lax in;
They scorned the lancet's pointed sting,
They mocked the enervating vaccine 1
Against all else the righteous kicks
Except his private CONSCIENCE' pricks I
I grant they flourished in an age
Ere JENNER spoke in this connection;
Before that overrated sage
Devised his loathly lymph-injection;
Yet, had they lived to see his day,
Would they nave yielded? No, not they!
And, Heaven be praised, a precious few
Still hear their CONSCIENCE when it
wheezes,
The smallish voice that bids them do
Their little best to spread diseases;
In fact we mean to have our claws
In all the sanitary laws.
We look to see, by steady work,
A state of filth in every gutter;
To get the germs of death to lurk
In milk and even bread-and-butter;
And drains, like vaccination, shall
In time be purely optional.
"Live and let live!"—so ran the cry
In days when people knew no better;
This we propose to rectify
Both in the spirit and the letter;
Observe our motto—newest make—
"Die and let die!—for CONSCIENCE' sake."
NOTE AND CORRECTION.—In our last
week's issue, some of Mr. Punch's numbers
contained a line under "Cartoon Junior"
alluding to the Anti-Vaccination Bill as
having "passed," while in other numbers
it was in the same place mentioned as
"awaiting third reading in the Commons."
The event will prove whether the vaticina-
tion on anti-vaccination was right or not.
But, of course, "awaiting third reading"
is the right wording, the other being
"matter in the wrong place," arrived
there by a "concatenation accordingly,"
the details of which it is altogether un-
necessary to explain.

AT THE PALACE.
MR. CHARLES MORTON may shake hands
with himself as heartily as all his friends
will shake hands with him, when congratu-
lating him on the success of his present
capital entertainment at the Palace Theatre
of Varieties, a Music Hall indeed, which,
by the aid of Mr. ALFRED PLUMPTON and
his well-selected orchestra, becomes now
and again, in the course of the evening's
show, a genuine hall of music, and the
result to the proprietors will be a haul of
profits.
Mr. AMANN, "the facial artist and im-
personator," is admirable in his line,
rapidly making himself up and changing
himself, in sight of the audience, into all
sorts of distinguished personages, and, in
spite of the dictum of BURNS that
"Amann 's Amann for a' that," this artist
in clothes and colour completely destroys

"Oi 've 'arf a moind to show 'em up, or reyther
take 'em down. Oi 'ardly knows which way 'ud be
the bert."
his own identity. Do not be alarmed
when a handsome Sarah Siddons-like lady,
of a commanding presence, walks on to
the stage attired in deepest black (evening
dress), and in tones as deep as the colour ot
her costume, begins to sing. No! it is not
"Hamlet's aunt," it is JULIE MACKKY,
"Comedienne," if you please, and in a few
seconds the laughter of the surprised audi-
ence tells you the "Comedienne " has made
a hit.
The BAGGESBNS are exhaustingly funny.
Their action is illustrated by more plates"
than there are in a quarter's collection of a
pictorial paper. Crockery is cheap where
the BAGGESENS come from, and how the
male BAGGESEN geta himself hopelessly
mixed up with an adhesive fly-paper is
a thing to see and a joy to remember.
Then the unrivalled ALBERT CHEVALIER,
a thorough artist au bout des angles. His
old peasant singing, "'E can't take a Raise
out of Oi," is admirable ; his expression, his
laugh, the action of his hands, every move-
ment is a study from life reproduced with-
out any caricature whatever. Of course,
his Coster is inimitable as ever; but his
curate is conventional, and is the only
figure which his admirers would like him to
omit from the list. His rendering of " My
Old Dutch" compels a house, crowded from
back seat of gallery to front row of stalls,
to sympathetic silence, and not a few will
experience the "hysterica passio" against
which so many struggle by forced bjowing of
noses. Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER is better
than ever.
Then comes "The American Biograph."
Wonderful 11 But, my eyes 1 my head I! and
the whizzling and whirling and twittering
of nerves, and blinkings and winkings that
it causes in not a few among the spectators,
who could be content with half the show,
or even a third of it. It is a night-mare!
There 's a rattling, and a shattering, and
there are sparks, and there are showers of
quivering snow-flakes always falling, and
amidst these appear children fighting in
bed, a house on fire, with inmates saved by
arrival of fire engines, which, at some in-
terval, are followed by warships pitching
about at sea, sailors running up riggings
and disappearing into space, trains at full
speed coming directly at you, and never
getting there, but jumping out of the pic-
ture into outer darkness where the audi-
ence is, and then, the train having van-
ished, all the country round takes it into
its head to follow as hard as ever it can,
rocks, mountains, trees, towns, gateways,
castles, rivers, landscapes, bridges, plat-
forms, telegraph-poles, all whirling and
squirlmg and racing against one another,
as if to see which will get to the audience
first, and then, suddenly .... all disappear

ment where you will. Still, j_ust a third

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
TU.au THE DlAKY OF TUBY, M.I'.
House of Commons, Monday, July 25. —
SARK often says there has been an arch-
deacon, almost a dean, thrown away in the
Member for East Marylebone. Put BOUL-
NOIS in a surplice, set him up on high in a
pulpit, and if he only glances round on
the congregation it will ue as good a» tue
average sermon. Certainly there ever rests
on BOULNOIS' countenance a smiling air
of peace and plenty soothing to the
troubled breast.
To-day its habitual calm broken by an
anguished look. Is in charge of what is
known as the Marylebone Churches Bill.
Quite a mediaeval flavour about its story.
Early in century the good Duke of PORT-
LAND, who owned much land in Maryle-
bone, bethought him how he might im-
prove its value. Occurred to him it would
invest district with air of respectability,
and ultimately raise the rents, if he
sprinkled a few churches about the pro-
perty. But churches cost money, and with
prophetic forecast of death duties to be
brought in ninety years later by a ruthlesp
Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Duk£
felt impulse to economy. Then flashed
upon him memory of the contemporary
magnate and public benefactor,
Mr. BROWN, who of his great bounty
Built this bridge at expense of the counhy.
The Duke would build the churches at the
expense of the parish, and then magnani-
mously, regardless of expense, present
them to the parishioners. Moreover, he
got Acts of Parliament passed whereby
the parishioners were for ever engaged to
support the churches. Then the good
Duke, feeling he had not lived in vain,
folded his hands across his breast, and was
gathered to his fathers.

.vork, reporting Bill without amendment.
"A thoroughly disreputable trick," said
rjLOYD GEORGE, translating without oir-
;umlocution from the Welsh.
It was here that BOULNOIS displayed the
shocked look that varied his ordinary
•erenity. "I am surprised," he said, "at
;he language of the hon. Member."
It was indeed shocking. BOULNOIS com-
forted with knowledge that he had carried
through the little affair about the churches.
Business done.—London University Bill
read a third time and passed.
Tuesday.—Never saw PRINCE ARTHUR so
suddenly, utterly, depressed. At question
time quite brisk; more than usually success-
ful in saying as little as possible with appear-
ance of taking anxious inquirer into fullest
confidence. Not been the same man since
Mullingar loomed on the stage.
PATRICK O'BRIEN, having put on a new
necktie, a clean shirt-front, and a kummer-
bund, dragged in Mullingar. It appears
that the Mullingar Board of Guardians,
regarding a speech delivered by HATDEN,
M.P., on the Irish Local Government Bill
as "anti-clerical," have, in accordance with
irresistible rules of logic, resolved to with-
hold insertion of their advertisements in
Mr. HATDEN'S newspaper.
"This," says PATRICK O'BRIEN, mo-
mentarily rousing himself from the mincing
lir and manner superinduced by hia
fashionable apparel, "is the worst case pi
ittempting to intimidate a Member of Uiia
House I evor heard of."
PRINCE ARTHUR admitted that it waj
ndeed blood-curdling. But what would
^ou? What could be expected of Mul-
.ingar? Leave the Guardians wrapped
ibout in the obscurity of the contempt
chat every right-minded man must feel for
them. In the dead unhappy night, when
the rain is on the roof, Remorse, naked'
aanded, will stalk through the alleys of
Mullingar, and smite the white soul of each
shuddering Guardian of the Poor.
Thus PRINCE ARTHUR (or something like
this), anxious, above all things, to get on
with business. REDMOND aine not to be
put off with fine words which butter no
Suardians. HAYDEN one of his small but
<elect party. Useful thing to let Ireland
see it is not to be touched with impunity
So insisted upon having his pound of flea!
cut out of the miscreant Mullingars.
House had uneasy consciousness that ii
never touches question of privilege without
making itself ridiculous. If it passed reso
lution declaring conduct of Mullingai
Guardians breach of privilege, other step!
must follow. "Surely," said PRINCI
ARTHUR, in anguished tone, "you don'1
want to have the Mullingar Board a
Guardians brought to the Bar of thi

Business done.—The House of Common*
solemnly denounces the Mullingar Board
of Guardians as guilty of Breach of
Privilege.
Thursday.—House talking for two hours
with rising passion about some one's
iniquity in connection with Provisional
Order Bill. As far as I can make out the
matter, Bill as it passed earlier stages
approved a particular site for a Board
School called "plan 10." When Bill came
up for report stage it was found that plan
10 had disappeared; gone in the night;
swallowed up by an earthquake.
Yes, but Radical Members want to know
Who made the earthquake? Suspicion
first fell upon JOHN o' GORST. Then
Rontgen rays turned on Chairman of Ways
and Means. Traces clearly visible of a
hand, recognised as his, in act of striking
out the clause. That seemed conclusjve.
But ROBSON, Q.C., trained in criminal
cases, perceived, and pointed out to startled
House, shadowy figure of another hand
directing Chairmaws. Whose was that P
As ROBSON, Q.C., fulminated this in-
quiry, his eye, accidentally as it seemed,
fell upon HUGH CECIL, seated in sacerdotal
attitude below gangway opposite. A mo-
ment's pained pause. Then Lord HUGH
lifted his tall form, and like a CECIL—told
the truth. He had had no direct commu-
nication with Chairman of Ways and
Means, but had certainly "conversed" in
ordinary way with Vice-President of
Council, and—and—well, plan 10 had
disappeared from the Bill, and there would
be one School Board school the less in
London.
Upon that fact Lord HUGH openly
gloated. Members opposite squirmed, but
they liked the young lord's frankness and
his courage. At same time, when fresh
Provisional Orders affecting school sites
are about, an eye will be kept on HUGH
CECIL .
Business done.—PRINCE ARTHUR hears
with sigh of relief that Mullingar has
magnanimously resolved not to take ad-
vantage of the blunder into which he was
on Tuesday entrapped.
Friday.—How fleeting are the pleasures
of life I How short its satisfactions!
Here's the Mullingar business, after all,
not finally laid. P. O'BRIEN informed
shuddering House that there is reason to
suspect the Board of Guardians' retreat
was merely strategic. Going to wait till
Parliament prorogued; then, with no fear
of privilege penalties before them, they
will withhold their advertisement from
HAYDEN, M.P.'s newspaper.
House hopes no one clad in human form
could be so iniquitous; but PATRICK is
positive. "If they do," he said, even he
shrinking from more directly specifying
the crime, "I '11 bring every one of them
here next Session, and the person who
inspired them to action."
The prospect of P. O'B. dragging in the
Mullingar Guardians by his kummerbund,
laying them out one by one at Bar of the
House, and then going in search of "the
person who inspired them to action,"
steeped the House in gloom.
Business done.—PRINCE ARTHUR wishes
there weren't no such place as Mullingar.

appreciated at regattas on the Thames, but
not crabs.

the gig is lying alongside the steps. One

are rowed out to 50-ton yawl. Climb up

Arrive Cowes. Crowd of yachts.
Drop anchor for night. Go below, damp
face in tiny iron basin; yacht lurches and
rolls all the water out over new white
shoes. Enter saloon, tripping over some
one's kit-bag at the door. Try to save
myself by clutching at swing-table, which
upsets and empties soup tureen all over
my trousers. Retire, change, return.
Host and I sit down and proceed to
chase fried soles backwards and forwards
across treacherous swing-table. "Now,
my dear fellow, isn't this jolly? Isn't this

Nwrte. "TOMMY, THERE'S SOME JAM ON YOUR CHEEK."
Tommy (with interest). "THERE ISN'T ANY WORTH EATING, is THERE?"
DARBY JONES ON LAND AND SEA
RACING.
HONOURED SIR,—Daring my sojourn on
the Sea, my thoughts have nevertheless
turned with the Persistency of a Lover to
th? Main Attraction of Terra Firma. Need
I say that I refer to the Sport of Em-
perors, Kings, Grand Dukes. Noblemen,
and the Baser Herd? This Yacht-racing
business seems to me a Poor Thing com-
pared with the Diversion of the Turf.
From the point of view of an Owner, I
consider that the Marine Competitions are
ridiculous; from that of the General Pub-
lic, valueless. Let me illustrate my mean-
ing. A Sportsman such as the Duke of
PORTLAND, Mr. HARRY MCCALMONT, or
Mr. GUBBINS, invests a pile of Spondulicks
in buying or breeding and training a Colt
of Merit. This animal he enters for all
the most Valuable Contests possible. If
the Quadruped be of First-rate Quality,
he not only recoups his Proprietor for his
outlay, but also places many Thousands of
Pounds to hia credit at his Bankers in
Stnlm alvnr. I make no reference to
profits to be made from the Wagering
Ring. Even a Duke does not object to
his Fiscal Account being enlarged, and
Millionaires rejoice to be able to alle-
viate the necessities of their Poorer
Brethren with their gains. After his Turf
Career is over, the Horse is still remu-
nerative, either as the Progenitor of other
Highflyers in Great Britain, or as a Costly
Article eagerly sought after by Foreign
Governments or American Klondikers.
The First-class Racehorse, then, has done
more than paid for his Education and
Grub. He has been an Investment of con-
siderably more value than one in the
Three per Cents. Moreover, he has been
"a Boon and a Blessing" to those who
have followed his Career, and have not hesi-
tated to stake Coin of the Realm on his
chances of Victory.
Let me now turn to the Waves. A Rich
Gentleman, partial to Canvas Struggles on
the Briny, causes a Yacht to be built, with
which he proposes to sweep the Seaboard
of its prizes. I am given to understand
that, apart from the A or No. 1 Expendi-
ture concomitant with the Construction
and Equipment of the Bark, he must spend
Ten or Twelve Thousand Golden Shekels
per annum in keeping the vessel going.
And what does he win with his Argosy,
should she turn out to be an ocean
La Fleche? Perhaps a few hundreds
of pounds, which are handed over to the
Greedy Mariners who navigate the Yacht,
and a collection of Silver Pots not to be
estimated by any Honourable Pawnbroker
at one-fourth the value of the Gold Cup
at Ascot. As to Bets, they are NIL,
except when an inexperienced Sprat like
myself is swallowed by a voracious Shark,
such as Captain KRITERION. Pshaw! And
of what use is the most famous of these
Cutters, Yawls and Schooners after, say,
a couple of years, when craft of newer
design have clipped her wings ?" Fire-
wood" appears to be the only sane answer.
Far be it from me to depreciate Yachting
as a Pastime like Coaching, Cricket, Foot-
ball, Quoits, or Shove-halfpenny, but as a
Racing Medium—no, Sir, 'tisn't good
enough for
Your Devoted Dry-bob,
DARBY JONES.

HOUSE VERSUS GROUSE.
THE House is a blank desolation—
Well, this is the moment for me
To startle the slumbering nation,
And let my constituents see
That while others, intent on mere pleasure,
Are tramping the heather for grouse,
I, faithfully watching each measure,
Still stick to my post in the House.
Yet, London ia horribly stuffy,
And Members who chance to be there
Are all far too hot and too huffy
To relish my eloquence rare.
What's China, or what 'e Vaccination F—
Sometimes when addressing the House,
I think there is worse recreation
Than tramping the heather for grouse.
O Duty! O Vaulting Ambition I
How I tremble ana crimson and blench
When I dream of a splendid position
On the front ministerial bench.

FLOSSIE.—Yes, the tour you sketch
sounds delightful, including as it does
Paris, Brussels, most of Switzerland, and
the Italian lakes. But I 'm not sure
whether you will be able to accomplish
this, as you propose, at a cost of £3 17s. 6d.
Your scheme of labelling yourself and
travelling by goods train ia original, but
perhaps not quite feasible. Why not try
Sonthend for this year?
PHILANTHROPIST writes to recommend
Sandiford as a delightful holiday resort.
The climate is delightful, the scenery
lovely, and the accommodation at the
"Black Swan" absolutely unrivalled. My
reader* may place implicit trust in this
recommendation, since "Philanthropist"
is himself, I understand, the proprietor of
the "Black Swan."
RECLUSE.—Yes, I quite understand your

ordinary run of tourists, and where you
won't bo pestered by excursionists. Un-
fortunately, the only means of finding such

OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
THERE has been recently brought out by Messrs. GEORGE BELL
AND SONS, a most dainty pocket edition, in "one small volume
and no more," of HANS HOLBEIN'S celebrated Dance of Death.
With what grim, satirical touch would not HOLBEIN have
added an anti-vaccination cut to his series! The introductory
note by AUSTIN DOBSOX gives additional interest to this livrette
lit: luff,.
Excellently got-up, and clearly printed is the very
handy series of "The Temple Dramatists, brought out by J. M.
DENT & Co. The late_st addition to this issue is Edward, the
Third, a play to which it is impossible to doubt that SHAKSPEARE
was a contributor. Mr. G. C. MOORE SMITH, the present editor,
is of this opinion, though against hi™ are ranged some of the
most learned Shakspearian critics. Act II., Scene 1, is worthy
of SifAK.spK.AitK. The idea of a lover employing a poet to make
love for him to his inamorata, is the chief motive of Cyrano de
Bergerac. A coincidence. King Edward ia the lover, and Ludu-
wick is the poet.
K. E. Hast thou pen, ink, and paper ready, Lodowiek }
Lod. Rpady, mv liege.
"Then," sayg King Edward to him, "drop into poetry" (this
phrase does not occur in the play), whereupon Lodowick in-
quires:—
"To whom, my lord, shall I direct my style f"
Whereupon King Edward tells him to address his poetic effusion
to the Countess of SALISBURY; but as it eventuates that Edward
the Third is a better hand at "lyrics" than the professional
gentleman whose services he has engaged, the King, after
severely criticising the efforts of the hired poet, cries,
"Love cannot sound well but in love's tongues;
Give me the pen and paper, I will write.
Just as Lady Macbeth impetuously exclaims "Give me. the
dagger I" We trust there are many more as interesting volumes
as this latest production from "The Temple Dramatists."
Something gcigeous in the way of journalism de luxe is the
English edition of La Mode Artistique, entitled, The Powder
Puff. Queens, Royal Highnesses, Princesses, and Duchesses
patronise it, so it requires no "puff" from the Baron, to whom,
as a compliment to the Baroness, the number for July has been
forwarded. Oh, the wonderful women with the fanciful
figures and waspish waists! And the bathing ladies! Why
not dress the entire ballet of baigne.uses in Les Huguenots after
the fashion shown at page five? Then there 's a scene in the
salle a manger of that hotel in Paris, into which, on account of
its ominous name, not even the most unprincipled debtor would
dare to venture, ri:., the Hotel "Bit:." The coloured fashion-
plates are charming, especially the toilette de campagne creee
pour Madame de P (is it La Princesse de Petits-Pois?), in
which the wearer must feel herself so free and easy, that were
she to change her present attitude the effect might be fatal.
On second thoughts, this work shall not reach the Baroness's
eyes, otherwise there might be a financial crisis in the City. "The
Powder Puff, chez moi, must be discreetly bestowed, as powder
puffs generally are," quoth the judicious BARON DE B.-W.

THEBJB was a Time—inadequately sung—
When this extremely hoary World was
young;
When none had learned, to any marked
extent,
How sweet the uses of Advertisement,
Which, like the ugly toad, as someone said,
Still wears a useful jewel in his head.
Blest Age! ere Modesty was yet a jade,
When even Authors loved the lowly shade;
And sooner would have sunk inside the
tomb
Than urge the loud preliminary boom!
No writer cared to sketch himself from life,
Or tell the World how much he loved his
wife;
No interviewer claimed the current prices
For painting chaste suburban Paradises,—
The lady-novelist among her flowers,
The playwright plotting in his rural bowers.
Waiving alike their private woes or whims,
They sat apart composing local hymns;
And called themselves, in fine contempt for
fame,
By HOMER'S (or another person's) name.
No publishers would wax exceeding stout,
Because there were no publishers about;
And consequently nobody decreed
What sort of stuff was proper stuff to read.
No enterprising literary sweaters
Assumed the thoughtful air of Men ol
Letters,
Or posed as patrons of the gentle Arts
Because they sold a tale in monthly parts.
No rising genius would hang his wall
With ancestors that never lived at all;
Or deem his penetralia incomplete
Without a parent made in Wardour Street.
No snob would tell his neighbour Who was
Who,
Because the other party always knew;
And people seldom spoke of blood and birth,
When all were relatives of Mother Earth.
No Baronet was seen to draw his sword
Upon the offspring of a legal Lord;
Or went for bogus Barts. with naked fist,
Seeing that titles did not then exist.
In brief, the Earth was full of fair content
Before the d——1 devised Advertisement!
But of the subsequent decline to speak
Will take us more than one ensuing week.
For 'tis, indeed, a very wide, wide World
At which our homely paper-dart is hurled,
Embracing many an intermarried tribe-—

The leading histrion, the lobby-hack,
The lying sportsman and the social quack,
The climbing orator, the nouveau riche,

Thursday.—" Thank Heaven for the

mopping his massive but heated brow as,
just now, he strode forth from the gilded
chamber. Truly a great triumph for Pre-
sident of Local Government Board. For
weeks been fighting the Anti-Vaceinists at
Ephesus—represented at Westminster by
the Grand Committee room. Brought in
his Bill; triumphantly carried second
reading; at later stage clause introduced
whereby a man having conscientious
scruples might, undeterred by penal con-
sequences, prepare tho way for spread of
small pox. Electoral exigencies compelled
Government surrender. The conscience,
or small pox, clause included in Bill and
sent on to the Lords. Ministerial majority
in that House, regardless of the Whips,
scored out the clause.
SARK says it was STANLEY OP ALDERLEY
did it. Impossible for the strongest pre-
judice, the most loyal deference to party
ties, to withstand his keen argument, his
subtle irony, his flashing eloquence.
I suppose that's so; but I confess I
didn't hear a word of the speech. When
AILESBURY had finished coughing out his
observations, I saw a peer advance to table
on Opposition side. There followed an in-
terval of something like ten minutes,
during which noble lords sat in attitude
of polite attention. Meanwhile the peer
stood at the table, turning his head
occasionally from side to side, now and
then thumping the table, as if he had
suddenly remembered something. Accom-
panying the pantomime was faint rumbling
sound, as if some one was imprisoned in
the cellar, and was wanting to know when
they would let him out for refreshments.
At the end of ten minutes the peer gave
the table a conclusive thump and sat down.
I thought he had at last remembered the
something he had been groping after.
But SARK says it was STANLEY OP ALDER-
LEY either supporting or opposing tht
amendment, he didn't know which. How-
ever it be, the small pox clause was
struck out and CHAPLIN revenged.

HANDLING A SPADE IN THE " QUARTERLY."
—In the Quarterly for July, a reviewer,
writing on "The Mycenaean. Age," "The
Greek Epic," and other works of light and
leading literature, gives his principal at-
tention to "The Spad» in Prehistoric
Greece." The interest of the reader is
naturally aroused to know whether these
Antiqu-insimi Gr&ci did "call a spade a
spade," or whether tiey possessed any
dexterous receipt for getting themselves
out of the difficulty. The learned writer
having found "reasonable links," will no
doubt in some future number, while
reserving his spade for a trump card,
improve the occasion offered by "reason-
able links" to discuss Antediluvian Golf.
Then as a sequitur, Classical Cricket and
Phoenician Football.

Ronald. "THEN WHY DO YOU WBAR THIS WlNGS OF ONE IN YOUR HAT t"
DARBY JONES ON A LAMENTED
DEATH AND TURF NOMENCLATURE.
HONOURED SIR,— Ever since escaping
from the Hon. FLIFLATT, Captain KRJTE-
BION it Co. at Southampton under the
plea (like officers during the Crimean war)
of "urgent family affairs," I have rejoiced
at my return to Terra Firma. I can sur-
mise, Sir, that you will enquire "who was
responsible for the hire of the Yacht P"
I resent the prohably enquiry, and indig-
nantly, though ungrammatically, reply,
"Not me "—distinctly Not Me. I took
a train as quickly as I could to Kempton
Park riil Clapham Junction, and immedi-
ately returned with the joy of an Urchin
released from his Seminary to Holiday
Pleasure. Perish the Sea and all its Attri-
butes. Give me the Land.
But Kempton Park was far from cheer-
ful. You need not enquire why now. Mr.
S. H. HYDE, the honoured and loved Secre-
tary and Manager, passed away during the
battling of the meeting of which he was
both Creator and Director. His death
caused a Thrill throughout the Gathering
as powerful as was the beat of his Noble,
Honest Heart. Mr. HYDB, Sir, was not
only a Great but a Good Man. He had
the Welfare of the Turf in view, even to
TOL. cxv,
his own (apparent) Detriment. He sur-
mounted obstacles more difficult to nego-
tiate than those which he used in the
Winter Season at Kempton. He made the
Park what it is, the pest race-ground in
the world, and he was in the execution ol
his duty Fearless to do Right so that
others should do no Wrong. My Miserable
Muse is willing but unable to do justice to
his memory, but a Bard, who shall be name-
less, sends me the following limes: —
"Brave, honest soul! we ne'er again
Shall m i't beneath the Kempton treei;
Together hear the glad refrain
Of thousands whom you sought to please!
But this at least we surely know,
A favourite you were to " claim"
Not in a " selling " race. Y :iur name
Could not conceal the debt we owe
To Hun who never had a foe!"
To sum up, Mr. HYDB found Kempton a
wilderness, and left it an oasis in the
desert.
It is time, Honoured Sir, that the Work
ing Members of the Jockey Club should
turn their Attention, when not occupied
with the leasing of Desirable Lands round-
about Newmarket, to the Naming of the
Flyers of the Turf. The British Public is
a singularly Forbearing Animal, not alto-
gether dissimilar from the Patient Animal
known as the Jerusalem Pony. But the
B. P. likes to know its Methods of Pro-
gression. It strikes me, in the first place,
that it reflects no credit on the ingenuity
of an Owner of Racehorses to keep running
a colt or a filly with no more Definite
Appellation than that of Oliitr Twist when
he was admitted to the workhouse. To
read that the Geranium Colt or the Gar-
denia Filly has run some contest at Lewes
or Paisley is very misleading, when these
same Quadrupeds figure later on as Poly-
anthus and Stephanotis. The Racing Ca-
lendar is not largely bought by the B. P.,
and HBR MAJESTY'S permission is not
needed for change of name. I am sorry to
say that there are those who work this lax
state of affairs to their own Profit. Equally
pernicious is the system permitted of
adding Roman Numbers to quadrupeds
sharing the same name. I have read in the
Almanack de Gotha, which I have perused
(with the aid of a Dictionary, English-
French), that there is a distinguished Teu-
tonic Personage known as Prince HENRY
THB SIXTY-SEVENTH of Reuss. a Territory
subject to the will of the Father of the
Fatherland. Far be it from me to decry
the custom of this Ancient Principality,
but in common with many other Fre-
quenters of the Flat, I do demur to the
Practice of the Princes of Reuss (a terri-
tory considerably less than that devoted t <
the Turf of Great Britain^ being applied
to Equine Candidates for Honours in oui
own Country. We are already in the
Second Generation, Bridegroom II., St.
Cloud II. &c.; but where are we going
to stop? We may come to Bridegroom
XXIV., and St. Cloud XXXV. I know.
Honoured Sir, that there are Classic
Scholars (such as yourself) who earn hand
some incomes by standing Godfathers tc
this Colt or that Filly, and therefore the
more do I contend that the Jockey Clut
should ordain—
1. That all horses must run under t
given name.
2. That all owners should be forbiddei
to append numerals to such names.
This suggestion is not so controversia
as the Conscience Clause of the Vaccina
tion (Heaven help the Nation—never mini
the Vaccine) Government Dilly-dally Bill
but it is COMMON SENSE.
With such sentiments, I remain,

SONGS FOB THE NATION.
"Carmint, non leges!"—Soraee.
Naval Songs.—The importance of good
naval songs cannot be over-emphasised.
Unfortunately, none are published which
are up-to-date. The beautiful imagery of
the older songs of the Dibdin type is no
longer adequate in these days of ironclads
and torpedoes. It is evident that the
time-honoured expression, "shiver my
timbers," must rive way to "ram my pro-
tectiveplating, and so on, all along the
line. There may be a loss from a senti-
mental point of view. DIBDIN'S "Sweet
Little Cherub" would probably turn out
something like thii:
"There's a quick-firing gun that is perched up
aloft
To look after the foes of poor Jack!"
It doesn't look exactly right.
JACK'S Lovx.
I LOYB a gal, I do.
'Cos why? Her name is NANCY I
I swear as I 'E be true,
She says it's only fancy.
I says to her, "My dear,
Avast there, you 're a beauty!
You 've got no call to fear,
To love you is my duty.
"From out your conning-tower
Your search-lights gleam so brightly,
My heart they overpower,
They haunt me day-and-nightly.
Though I should steel my breast
With six-inch "Harveyed" armour,

Of your attack, my charmer!
"Just look me in the heye,
I ain't a dashed torpedo—
Now stow it, don't you cry,
There ain't a bit of need, oh I
My heart with love is hot
As any "Belleville" biler;
What makes you think it's not?

Besides, remember that my doctor told me
I was not to take a bath except with the

Still, leaving out the band—which will play

appointment. Still, with the books left
out, and the band—curse it!—banished,

ABOUT RIGHT, TOO!
'Arry(on Tc ur in Norway). "So THIS is KIDINO IN A STOLKJKRRE, is IT? WELL, I CALLS IT RIDING IN A JOLT-YER AND
FRIGHTEN-YER!"
(?) FROM "FAB CATHAY."
AT vast expense, we commissioned a (more or leas) trusted
correspondent to send us a brief account of some junk rtcing,
which, he informed us, was quite the rage amongst the Chinese
"JeuneMe Dorte."* It runs thus: —
On my arrival in this far-off land, I met, by _ chance, a
neglected native poet, UN-SUNG, who, together with a com-
panion of his. accompanied me to the scene of the great aquatic
contest, which is here known as the festival of Kowe-Sweek-
Yot-ting. UN-SUNG kindly furnished me with the names of the
competing junks and their owners, which I append: —
Junk. OvHfr.
1. Ayl-Sah .... SuN-or-JiM.
2. Sm-Tah .... AYB-BL--SINO.
3. Bo-Kah .... Du-KnB-An-Roo-8Bi.
4. £ya-old-ah . . . DoN-Auj-Srx.
In gratitude for this, I invited UN-SUNO and his friend to
moist on their celestial lips with some wiskisodah (native drink).
Both he and his companion, TAY-KA-LONO-WUN, readily accepted,
and we adjourned to a small refreshment house (" 1'uh-lik"),
and there sipped this not ungrateful fluid. Under its influence,
I'N-Suso lifted up his voice, and drawing a roll of closely-
written manuscript, about four feet long, from his sleeve, pro-
ceeded ti read me much of his life's work—more of his life's
work, in fact, than I had any use for, at that moment. I told
him I would call in and take the rest when I had a month hang-
ing heavy on my hands. Then we went out and watched the
noble junks hoist their great white sails aloft, and prepare for
the start.
When all was at length in readiness, the Mandarin presiding
over the Festival, and who was addressed as Kom-ah-dor, fired
% signal gun (the recoil from which knocked him flat on his
back, and sent his peacock's feather flying), and the com-
petitors were despatched on their journey, or, in the quaint
language of the people, were " Vn-daK-wai." The junk belong-

<zcitement prevailed along the shore where I stood, and order
utd to be preserved by tie "Bob-bais," or native police. The
junks were soon temporarily lost to sight, and then, whilst
)lack-fnced troubadours twanged on stringed instruments, and
sang their native love songs, most of the people opened baskets
*nd partook of the mid-day repast ("Lun-Chon"), this being
.vashed down by copious draughts of Ay-yah-lah-aec, Klee-Ko,
Mo-Ay, and other delectable drinks,
So cosmopolitan have I become from much travel, that,
'nstead of wrapping myself up in my insular pride and pre-
judice, I determined to share their frugal repast, and to make
nyself one of them, so, selecting what looked like the party of
i high-class Mandarin, I nodded genially to him. and taking
from his hand the bottle from which he was helping himself
to Mo-Ay, poured out a tumblerful and was raising it to drink his
health, when, to my intense astonishment, it was dashed from my
hands, and, almost at the same time, I seemed to be sitting on
his foot for a brief moment, and then lying on my face with my
nose buried in the crust of the puppy-dog pie. For an instant, I
could hardly grasp the fact that I had been insulted ("Kik-Tout"
in the vernacular). Not content with this, the Mandarin, who,
I have since hoard, belongs to the most exalted Order of the
Royal "Yots-Kwod-Eon," commanded a Bob-bai to "Tank-y-
jrumtt" and I was ignominiously conducted through the crowd
by my collar. I explained to the almond-eyed follower of CON-
FUCIUS that if he would release me, I would bestow upon him
a certain reward. I also informed him that I was a lone, unpro-
tected male, far from home and friends and things, and whether
it was my tale of woe or the tael of silver which I gave him, I
cannot say, but the fact remains that he let me go.
Having got rid of TAY-KIM-UP, I returned, but avoided
catching the eye—or foot—of the Mandarin who had treated
me so inhospitably. The junk of AYE-Bu-SiNG ultimately gained
a victory over that belonging to Du-Kss, DoN-ALD-Stm being
third with Eyes-old-ah. Am just off to Pekin. CHIN CHIN.

and cheap, since they are practical and frugal. But it is none

IP one may credit what the bards record,
That Virtue's self was once her sole reward,
Then, to the thoughtful student of to-day,
It aeems that some of us have gone astray.
And when we try to probe the crucial spot,
To touch the germ of this lamented "rot,'-
We find the doctors, our supposed superiors,
Have quite forgot to dose their own
interiors;
That those who teach in novel, play and
poem
The paths of Virtue, so that fools may
know 'em,
And therefore might, a little less than
others,
Set bad ensamples to their simpler brothers,
Themselves purvey the Truth, the written
sign,
For all the lucre they can lift per line.
Time was, before the art became a trade,
When authorship was rather lightly paid;
When just a paltry fiver was the price
Of MILTON'S little thing on Paradise;
But, though I think that inwardly he swore
Because he failed to make a trifle more,
He would not ask aloud for further oof,
But, rich in Virtue's rubies, smiled aloof,
Deeming their value, nett, to be enormous,
Compared with baser gems from Ind or
Ormus.
Nor did the best of writers then suspect
That they were Heaven's peculiar own elect,
Or wear the swollen head and pompous airs
Of persons who conduct the World's affairs.
Take NHAKSPKAKK, now—the well-known
man who wrote
A deal of poetry that people quote—
Having revealed some promise in his plays.
How did he spend his later manhood's days?
Did he appear on platforms in a wreath
With rows of paid reporters underneath P
Did he inflame the interviewer's heart
With lectures on Elizabethan art P
Or issue public bulletins upon
The operations he had undergone P
Did he engage his critics in a feud P
Or sit for several portraits P No; he brewed!
Brewed, too, for just the joy of making
beer,
And not in order to become a Peer;
Brewed pecks of malt in that domestic
haven
From which he took the title, Swan of
Avon;
Although to him it never ono* occurred
That he resembled that engaging bird.
He wore his wisdom lightly as the air,
nd wondered how it happened to be there;
Did not so much as mention in his will
One solitary product of his quill;
And left posterity to lie awake on
The question whether SHAKSPEABB wasn't

Observe the representative of Man 1
(That is, the island, not the human race,
The Author's view not counting in the case)
Fair lies his home on yonder castled hill,
The tout's resort, the puffer's Rosherville,
For truly he must travel far to seek
A place to spend a more suggestive week.
There by the Master's side his hours are
spent
Imbibing candid tips on self-content;
Of which he ultimately gets the gist
Type-written by the Master's actual fist;
Together with an incidental hint
That things like this look better still in
print.
But when the compromising truth is out,
How all the blessed booming came about,
The Author asks: "Am I a Cainine dog,
That I should urge my own revolving log?"
Alleges that he never, never thought
His confidence was being sold and bought;
Tf hospitality is thus betrayed,
The race is growing sadly retrograde!
And while a pretty interchange of blows
Peppers the Master's eyes and minion's
nose,
And each apparently is taking pains
To drag the other's honour through the

You find—so cleverly the thing is done—

WHEN the story of NANSEN'B journey. Farthest North, was
first published, it was, necessarily, issued at a price prohibitive
save to "them as is rich and rides in chaises." Now, thanks to
the business enterprise of Messrs. GEORGE NEWNES, we can all
buy the book and read "like blazes." It is out, at moderate
price, in two handsome volumes, with all the original illustra-
tions, including a splendid map of the arctic circle. It is too
late in the day to say anything of the profound interest of this
wondrous tale. But my Baronite, turning over the familiar
pages presented in nice new dress, is again struck by the rare
literary faculty possessed and modestly displayed by NANSEN.
Anybody could go and not find the North Pole. It isn't given
to every one, especially a foreigner, to produce a masterpiece of
writing in the English tongue. The Dedication to his wife is a
pearl of a sentence, exquisite in its tenderness. Twelve words
long, yet telling a life's story: "To her who christened the ship
and had the courage to wait."
The fourth volume of THACKERAY'S works (SMITH, ELDER)
includes the Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, the Fitz Boodle Papers,
and others less well known to the average reader. It brings Mrs.
RITCHIE'S recollections, being the story of her father's life, down
to 1839-44. At this time the THACKERAYS were living at
13, Great Coram Street, Russell Square, the' head of the house-
hold hard at work winning bread. THACKERAY, in addition to
writing for Punc'i, Bentley, Fraser, and other periodicals, con-
tributed to the columns of the Times, and the Morning Chronicle.
His chief work of the period was Burry Lyndon, of which he
seems to have got tired much sooner than does my Baronite. In
his diary, written at Malta, on his famous journey from Cornhill
to Cairo, there are pathetic entries testifying to weariness of the
work. In a footnote to her charming chapter of biography, Mrs.
RITCHIE tells a lovely story about an unnamed Lord Mayor.
Dining at the Mansion House one night, THACKERAY observed
his Lordship nodding to him in friendliest fashion. "I know
you," said his genial Lordship, " HORACE Twiss." The author
of the Life of Lord Eldon was at the time well known in the
London world, and a personal friend of THACKERAY'S. But
THACKERAY protested he was not HORACE Twiss. The Lord
Mayor was not to be contradicted in the Mansion House. It
finally came out that he mistook THACKERAY for DICKENS, whose
Olivtr Twist was then the talk of the town. By further mixing
up the name of HORACE Twiss with that of DICKENS'S hero, the
Lord Mayorial mind, in waggish mood meet for a Mansion
House dinner, showed THACKERAY how clearly he recognised
him. THE BARON DZ B.-W.
A NOTE ON THE "LONG."
To THE EDITOR OF "PUNCH."
SIB,—As the representative of the legal profession, I beg to
address you on a popular fallacy. About this time of the year,
when the Courts are up and the members of the four Inns are
supposed to be on the wing, the public insist that practice at the
Bar is not only pleasant and lucrative, but full of leisure. The
fact that the wig-case contains its wig during two or three
months out of the twelve is produced as evidence that counsel
learned in the law, to put it colloquially, have an easy time of it.
Pray let me disabuse the public mind of so false an impression.
Let me take my own case. I can solemnly declare (and my
declaration will be supported by my admirable and excellent
clerk, PORTINGTON) that I have every bit as much work to do
during the Lone Vacation as at &ny other period of the forensic
year. Yours faithfully, (Signed) A. BRIEFLESS, JUNIOR.

"I TELL you I cannot accept the brief,"
replied the young barrister, in answer to
the solicitations of the leading solicitor.
"But, my dear Sir, it will lead to fame
and fortune."
"That may be," replied the young man,
suppressing a sigh; "but I must do my
duty."
The solicitor retired regretfully, and his
place was taken by a celebrated publisher.
"You must stay on and finish that work,
for that will double the balance at your
bankers."
"No," returned the young man, "it is
impossible; I have something more impor-
tant to claim my attention."
And the publisher, crestfallen and sor-
rowful, retired.
"Accept this appointment and become
a millionaire," urged a prince of finance,
who had succeeded to the others. "All
you have to do is to attend from Monday
to Friday from 10 to 4, leaving on Satur-
day a couple of hours earlier."
Again the young man answered in thf
negative. He would not accept enormous-
wealth, he would not secure worldwide
fame.
"No," said he to his friends, in expla-
nation. "You gee, I have been chosen for
my county eleven, and playirtg in my
county eleven's matches must be my first,
my only consideration."
And his friends, being fond of cricket
and wanting to see a good score, cordially
agreed with him.
THE REASON WHY.
DKAR MR. PUNCH,—I have heard many
theories suggested for the adoption of the
celebrated Conscience Clause by our Va-
cillation Government. But I think that I
am alone in having discovered the true
reason. It is simply because our Lords
and Masters are aware that the surplus and
unproductive population needs thinning.
We have no great war in immediate view,
Russian arrogance in China notwithstand-
ing. So the Conscience Clause affords a
ready means of exterminating the untaxed
classes. It is a great scheme, having only
one drawback, viz.; that while the dregs
of humanity may sink to the bottom, the
scum of the movement may seriously affect
the top of Society. We only need Free
Trade in poisons to make our future
system perfect. Yours obediently,
BOANERGES BROWN.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED PROH THE DIARY or TORY, M.P.
House of Commons, ZIonday night,
August 8. — Regarding prospect from
strictly business view, if we must have
ministerial crises, much better they should
take place in the Lords than in the
Commons. If it were the custom for Lords
to issue trade circular, they would be
justified in having the permanent " N.B.—
Ministerial Crises conducted with punc-
tuality and despatch."
When House met to-night, strongest
Ministry of modern times was in tight
place. The small pox clause, which PRINCE
gloomy GALWAY, the delapidated DE LA
ZOUCHE, the fevered FEVERBHAM, angry
ALDENHAM, pertinacious PORTSMOUTH, and
grim GLE.VESK from the frozen Nortk—each
followed the other, shaking pennon and
clashing mailed hands in despite of their
Lord the MARKISS.
"The Thanes fly from me," the MARKIBS
murmured, looking round to see if anybody
else wanted to say anything.
Nobody rising, least of all in support of
the clause, up gat the Premier, and front-
ing fickle Fortune as if the jade still smiled
upon him, delivered a perfect speech, just
twelve minutes long, that seemed to leave
nothing unsaid. Whole business, including
bly, GEORGE CURZON has won his way by
sheer capacity and pluck to a ministerial
position circumstances combined to make
one of exceptional delicacy and difficulty.
These very conditions that would have
overcome a weaker man have completed
his success, and paved the pathway of
promotion.
Long ago, when the House used more
or less indulgently to smile at his ora-
torical efforts made below the gangway,
it was foretold on this page that GEORGB
CURZON would "go far. I confess at the
time of making that entry I did not think
it would be all the way to Calcutta, to share
the Viceregal Throne with a gracious lady,

"IMITATION IS THE SINCEREST," &c.
Now, if either of thin gentlemen (Cap'en T-mmy B-wl-s, Mr. A-Bt-n Ch-mb-rl-n, and Mr. B-rtl-y) mcceedfd Mr. C-rz-n, with a very HUle
trouble on their pan iin1 change (pictuiiaily) could really be made scatcely perceptible!
ARTHUR, in deference to electoral exigen-
cies, had grafted on Vaccination Bill, was,
in spite of entreaty from the MARKISS,
thrown out by majority of 2. The Com-
mons reinstated it. Now Bill come back
to Lords; next and final stroke of the
game with them. Would they insist on
elimination of clause, or would they
surrender?
In analogous circumstances the Commons
would have been thronged; seething with
excitement. The Lords turned up just a
hundred strong. Some acceleration of
conversation, some flitting to and fro be-
tween ministerial bench and the railed
enclosure of Throne, within which stood
PRINCE ARTHUR and other colleagues from
the Commons. Nothing that would have
suggested to uninformed looker-on that a
principal measure of the Session was in
dire peril. Peer after peer rose from
centre of ministerial camp and preached
revolt. The raucous ROOKWOOD, the
division, over in an hour. Plenty of time
for noble lords to take a turn in the Park
before dressing for dinner. In the Com-
mons, we should have made at least a long
night of the job, and not altered its con-
clusion by a single vote.
Business done.— Lords, constrained by
contumelious Commons. By 55 votes
against 45 undo what on Thursday they
the MARKISS, eat the leek proffered by the
accomplished by 40 votes against 38.
Vaccination Bill, transformed in its pro-
gress through Commons, now safe.
Tuesday.—Rumour current to-night that
India is about to add to her boundless
treasure possession of our GEORGE CURZON.
He is, on dit, (who's On?) to go out as
Viceroy in succession to Lord ELGIN. A
glittering prize for a still young man. If
proffered there will probably be, even in
this wicked world, no voice raised in dis-
paragement. Through a critical and, to
begin with, not particularly friendly assem-
a Pearl of the West worthy of rare setting
in the storied East.
Business dune. — Appropriation Bill
brought in.
Wednesday.-—PRINCE ARTHUR, dropping
remark casually in course of speech on
affairs in Far East, confirms report that
GEORGE CURZON is to be the new Viceroy
of India. Yesterday he was with us for the
last time, we listening to his answers all
unknowing that he was making his last
appearance as Under-Secretary for Foreign
Affairs. It is a way great statesmen have
of withdrawing from the Parliamentary
scene. So DIZZY wont; so GLADSTONE
walked forth, making no sign of farewell.
On all sides regret at the severance.
India's gain our loss. P. and O. SUTHER-
LAND has a charming idea of paying a com-
pliment to the new Viceroy. In the mighty

MAREISS in making graceful concessions
from the Foreign Office? Loaded with
honours by foreign states, entertained to
tea by the SULTAN (with a band playing in
the back garden), hailed "SILOMO" by
grateful but only partially clothed Africans,
why should he lack honour at home?
He might look higher than an Under-
Secretaryship. But it will serve to begin

Questi(m. You are out for your training
about this time?
Answer. Taking "this time" to mean
from late April to early September—yes.
Q. And during the remainder of the year
you do nothing?
A. Besides wearing my uniform at
levee or fancy ball, practically nothing.
Q. Then you cannot consider yourself
particularly useful from a military point of
view?
A. On the contrary, I am of a dia-
metrically opposite opinion.
Q. But surely this is not on all fours
with common sense?
A. I am not so certain of that, when
you take into consideration that a militia-
man, in one of his days of training, gets
over as much ground as that traversed by
a regular in a week.

First Customer. "WAITER, A FRIED SOLE."
Second Customer. "BRING MB A FRIED SOLE, TOO, WAITER—AND MIND IT is FRESH.
Waiter. "Two FRIED SOLES—ONE FRESH!"
Q. How many days a year do you have:
A. Twenty-seven, with deductions.
Q. What are the deductions?
A. The time occupied by getting int<
uniform and out of it, plus wet days anc
the hours given over to musketry instruc
tion.
Q. Why do you add the latter to youi
list of dies non?
A. Because, during the hurry-scurry oi
a militia training, instruction about tin
rifle and how to use it is valueless.
Q. If you are stationed at Aldershot 01
some other military camp of instruction
do you get as much benefit as when al
your own headquarters?
A. It is the general opinion that home
training is to be preferred. A battalior
should learn how to march in quick tim«
before being instructed in the double.
Q. From this, I take it you think com-
pany and squad drill is more useful to s
number of raw recruits or rusty veteran*
than brigade movements?
A. Yes; although this may not be the
opinion of some C. O.'s having a greatei
admiration for tinsel than gold.
Q. From a pecuniary point of view, if
service in the militia advantageous?
A. Certainly not, as it is impossible, on
the pay and allowances, to make both ends
meet.
Q. Then what is the advantage of
belonging to the Old Constitutional
Force?
A. It is comforting to the conscience to
know one is doing one's duty.
Q. But does not rank in the militia give
you precedence?
A. Which, according to some people, is
used only by fools or snobs.
Q. Then why serve?
A. Because England expects every man
to do his duty; and after all, there is
something in being a captain of militia.

WHY NOT HAVE AN EXPANDING JURY BOJC ON THE CONCERTINA PRINCIPLE, AS ABOVK? TAKE ANY SIZE JURYMAN. SUGGESTION GKATIS
DARBY JONES ON TURF RUFFIANISM
AND THE EBOR HANDICAP.
HONOURED SIR, — Ever since Horse-
Racing was established in this country,
and that is going back several centuries,
the Princely Pastime has attracted not only
the Favour of the Great and Good, but
also the Attention of those Unprincipled
Ruffians who stick at No Crime, if so be
that they can see their way to Trowsering
more or less Filthy Lucre. The Daily
Ttleyraphj, after issuing considerably over
Fifteen Thousand Numbers of its smart
and news-giving sheets, has suddenly tum-
bled to the fact that Roughs exist upon
the lurf. It required no CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS, LIVINGSTONE, STANLEY, or
NANSEN, to discover this,—but all honour
to the D. T. for being bold enough to
show that a very Old Sore is nevertheless
in want of some Healing Treatment, and
that without delay. But the various Ama-
teur Doctors, who propose drastic measures
in the Largest Circulation for curing the
Evil and cite Vivid Examples of the growth
of the Pestilence, appear to forget that the
Remedy really rests with the Racegoers
themselves. Take, for instance, Goodwood,
the most Select and Fashionable Assem-
blage in the whole world barring, perhaps,
As.'lit. It is held in a Ducal Park, remote
from a Railway Station, and yet I will
guarantee to say that no gathering is more
saturated with the Scum and Dregs of De-
praved Humanity than is this first meeting
of the Sussex Fortnight.
The True Tales of Brigandage that 1
could relate in this connection would make
the Bishop of the Diocese tremble in his
Episcopal Palace. And the Robbers do not
practice their art under the Cover of
Night, but boldly pursue their malprac-
tices under the eyes of Phoabus Apollo and
the observance of the Policemen on so-
called Duty. Why, honoured Sir, even I
have had my Pockets rifled immediately
opposite the Grand Stand, not by the Sly
Pickpocket, but by a Band of Snatchers,
who, getting me off my legs from Front
and Back, have run the Rule over me like
so many Carpenters. On one occasion the
scoundrels relieved me of a Canvas Bank
Bag containing, alas! fifty golden Sove-
reigns. In less time than it takes me to
write this, they had appropriated my
Hard-earned Winnings, and, adding Insult

Assistance when I was lifted aloft like
Tom Bowling of Ballad Famep The Con-
stable whom I subsequently addressed on

marked that I ought to have known better

sometimes! This is only a Solitary Inci-
dent, and I mention it merely to show that
the Banditti do not hold up only the Inno-
cent and Unsuspecting, but also Old-
timers like myself. I believe that the
Underwriters at Lloyd's will insure against
almost any loss, but he would be a rash
Lloyd's man who guaranteed a visitor to
Goodwood against bushrangers. A worthy
Inspector from Scotland Yard, now no
more, once told ma that he had noted
999 Years of Penal Servitude walking
about on the Course.
But I have digressed. Let me suggest
a Nostrum. It Is no secret that the Duke
of RICHMOND AND GORDON does not permit
the meeting to be held in his Beautiful
Park from purely Philanthropic Motives.
A certain Grove may be Birdless, but on
such occasions the Oof Fowl wings it to
Goodwood House. You don't get on to
the Lawn or into the Paddock by showing
your Visiting Card. Clearly, then, his
Grace is morally, if not legally, bound to
protect his Patrons.
And now, Sir, to breezy York, whereof
the Archbishop signs himself "EBOR," no
doubt out of compliment to the famous
Handicap, now somewhat shorn of its
glory, but still a Record Contest. After
recklessly regaling my Muse on Yorkshire
Beef, Yorkshire Hams, and Yorkshire
Grouse, I warble :—
Tire Ocean that Waltzes I will not advise,
For th* Jersey Costume I prefer.
Bad Antler may give us a sorry surprUe
When the African Liner won't stir.
But the Born Charioteer I prefer for a place,
Not fontetting the Warrior's might,
Yet the Lock near to Florence nhiuM certainly race
And succumb to the Fawl on the Fhglit.
May my vaticination provide powder
and shot for the Partridges on the First

TIPS FOE TRAVELLERS.
TODDLEKINS is anxious to take his family
to Mars this summer, and inquires where
he can hire a speedy balloon for the pur-
pose. He is anxious to know whether he
can obtain golf there, and also whether the
roads are good for bicycling. He is re-
commended to apply for information to the
Astronomer-Royal. But why should Tod-
dlekins trouble to go so far afield? He
would be sure to find congenial society in
the neighbourhood of Hanwell, and by
selecting this spot as his destination, the
expense of a return-ticket would be saved.
ANXIOUS MOTHER.— So glad that you
intend taking your dear ten children to
Poppleton-on-Sea for three weeks' change
of air. And all that you tell me about
TIMOTHY'S pet rabbit and SELINA'S last
attack of measles is so deeply interesting.
Unfortunately I cannot answer all your
questions myself, but I will print them
here, so that some of my kind readers may
be able to assist you. You want to know,
in regard to Poppleton—
(1) Whether the pavements (if any) are
stone or asphalte.
(2) What is the mean temperature, the
annual rain-fall, and the death-rate.
(3) What are the Rector's "views," and
if there is a comfortable pew in the church,
out of draughts, calculated to hold eleven.
(4) What time the shops at Poppleton
close on Saturdays.
DUBIOUS.—As you say, it is difficult to
make up one's mind where to spend the
holidays, because there are so many places
from which to choose. And you were so
wise to write and ask me to give you the
name of one single place which I could
thoroughly recommend, and so save you all
further worry. How about Brighton,
Hastings, Eastbourne, Bexhill, Seaford,
Cowes, Weymouth, Exmouth, Penzance,
Lynton, or Tenby? I am delighted to give
you this real and valuable help!
PICNIC-PARTY.—You have my full sym-
pathy. It is most churlish of riparian
owners to refuse to allow strangers to land
on their property. Fancy any one object-
ing to having his lawn covered with broken
bottles and paper bags!
OWNER.—I feel deeply for you. The way
in which trippers on the river invade river-
side gardens is outrageous. The bags and
pieces of qlass they leave about must be a
gross disfigurement to your lawn.

For Poctor Some One says that be

meat as food in future we
Must drop.
The dishes that were once our joy
The Doctor now doth ban;
No more the tasty saveloy
Shall sputter in the pan;
The tender ohick, the juicy gteak,
The cutlet brown we must forsake—•

AN IDYLLIC ISLAND.
we came to Amsterdam, we de-
termined, PASHLEY, SHIRTLIFF and I, that
we would take the earliest opportunity ot
seeing Marken. Wonderful place, by all
accounts. Little island, only two miles
from mainland, full of absolutely unsophis-
ticated inhabitants. Most of them have
never left Marken — no idea of the world
beyond it! Everybody contented and
being treated like a show. We shouldn't
like it ourselves 1
That may be, but, as PASHLET retorts,
it "s the Markeners' own fault. They
shouldn't be so beastly picturesque.
Fine buxom girl approaches, carrying
pail. On closer view, not precisely a girl
—in fact, a matron of mature years. These
long, brown side-curls deceptive at a dis-
tance , impression, as she passes, of a kind
of Dutch "Little Toddlekins"; view of

equal; costumes quaint; manners simple
and dignified. Sort of Arcadia, with dash
of Utopia.
And here we are^actually at Marken,
just landed by sailing-boat from Monnick-
endam.
All is peaceful and picturesque. Scat-
tered groups of little black cottages with
scarlet roofs, on mounds. Fishermen strol-
ling about in baggy black knickerbockers,
woollen stockings, and wooden shoes.
Women and girls all dressed alike, in
crimson bodice and embroidered skirt;
little cap with one long brown curl dangling
coquettishly in front of each ear. Small
children—miniature replicas of their elders
—wander lovingly, hand in hand. A few
urchins dart off at our approach, like
startled fawns, and disappear amongst the
cottages. Otherwise, our arrival attracts
no attention.
The women go on with their outdoor
work, cleaning their brilliant brass and
copper, washing and hanging out their
bnght-hued cotton and linen garments,
with no more than an occasional shy side-
glance at us from under their tow-coloured
fringes. "Perfectly unconscious," as
SHIHTI.IFF observeSj enthusiastically, "of
how unique and picturesque and idyllic
they are!"
All the more wonderful, because excur-
sion steamers run every day during the
season from Amsterdam.
We walk up and down rough steps and
along narrow, winding alleys. SHIRTLIFF
says he "feels such a bounder, going about
staring at everything as if he was at Earl's
Ccurl." Thinks the Markeners must hate
broad back and extensive tract of fat, bare
neck under small cap. She turns round
and intimates by expressive pantomime that
her cottage is close by, and if we would
care to inspect the interior, we are heartily
welcome. Uncommonly friendly of her.
PASHLEY and I are inclined to accept, but
SHIRTLIFF dubious—we may have misunder-
stood her. We really can't go crowding
in like a parcel of trippers!
Little Toddlekins, however, quite keen
about it; sees us hesitate, puts down pail
and beckons us on round corner with
crooked forefinger, like an elderly Siren.
How different tnis simple, hearty hospita-
lity from the sort of reception foreigners
would get from an English fishwife! We
can't refuse, or we shall hurt her feelings.
"But whatever we do," urges SHIRTLIFF,
"wo mustn't dream of offering her money.
She 'd be most tremendously insulted."
Of course, we quite understand that. It
would be simply an outrage. We un-
cover, and enter, apologetically. Inside,
an elderly fisherman is sitting by the
hearth mending a net: a girl is leaning in
graceful, negligent attitude against table
by window. Neither of them takes the
slightest notice of us, which is embarrass-
ing. Afraid we really are intruding. How-
ever, our hostess—good old soul—has a
natural tact and kindliness that soon put
us at our ease. Shows us everything. Cur-
tained recesses in wall, where they go to
bed. "Very curious — so comfortable!"
Delft plates and painted shelves and cup-
boards. "Most decorative!" Caps and
bodices worn by females of the family.
"Charming; such artistic colour!" School
copybooks with children's exercises. "Capi-
tal; so neatly written!" What is she try-
ing to make us understand? Oh, in
Winter, the sea comes in above the level
of the wainscot. "Really? How very
convenient!" We don't mean this, but we
are so anxious to please and be pleased,
that our enthusiasm is degenerating into
drivel. Girl by the window contemplates
us with growing contempt; and no wonder.
High time we went.
Little Toddlekins at the end of her
tether; looks at us as if to imply that she
has done her part. Next move must come
from us. PASHLET consults us in an under-
tone. "Perhaps, after all, she does expect,
ehP What do we think? Would half a
gulden What P"
Personally, I think it might, but SHIRT-
LIFF won't hear of it. "Certainly not.
On no account! At all events, he '11 be no
party to it. He will simply thank her,
shake hands, and walk out." Which ho
do«s. I do the same. He may be right,
and anyhow, if one of us is to run the risk
of offending this matron's delicacy by the
offer of a gratuity, PASHLET will do it
better than I. PASHLEY overtakes us pre-
sently, looking distinctly uncomfortable.
"Did he tip her?" "Yes, he tipped her."
"And she flung it after you 1" cries SHIRT-
LIFF, in triumph. "I knew she would!
Now I hope you 're satisfied I"
"If I am, it's more than she was," says
PASHLET. "She stuck to it all right, but
ehe let me see it was nothing like what
she'd expected for the three of us."
SHIRTLIFF silent but unconvinced. How-
ever, as we go on, we see a beckoning
forefinger at almost every door and win-
dow. Every Markener anxious that we
should walk into his little parlour—and
pay for the privilege. All of them, as
PASHLET disgustedly observes, "On the
make "; got some treasured heirloom that

consideration. We don't press them; in
fact, we are obliged at last to decline their
artless invitations—to their unconcealed
disgust. Nice people, very, but can't
afford to know too many of them.
"At least the children are unspoilt,"
says SHIHTUFF, as we come upon a couple
of chubby infants, walking solemnly hand
in hand as usual. He protests, when
PASHLF.Y insists on presenting them with a
cent, or one fifth of an English penny,
apiece. "Why demoralise them, why in-
stil the lore of money into their innocent
minds?" SHIRTLIFF wants to know.
Fancy we have compromised all claims at
last. No; Marken infantry still harassing
our rear. What more do they want? It
appears that we have not paid the baby,
which is an important extra on these occa-
sions, and which they carry after ua in
state as an unsatisfied creditor and a
powerful appeal to our consciences. Adult
Markeners come out, and seem to be ex-
changing remarks (with especial reference
to SHIRTLIFF, who is regarded as the chief
culprit) on the meanness that is capable of
bilking an innocent baby.
"What I like about Marken," says PABH-

"Stern'y demanding five cent* a head."
Ho is delighted when they exhibit no
sort of emotion on being thus enriched.
It shows, he says, that, as yet, they have
no conception what money, means.
The pair have toddled off towards a
gathering of older children, and'PASHLEY,
who has brought a Kodak, wonders if he
can induce them to stay as they are while
he takes a snapshot. SHIRTLIFF protests
again. Only spoil them, make them con-
ceited and self-conscious, he maintains.
But the children have seen the Kodak,
and are eager to be taken. One of them
produces a baby from neighbouring cottage,
and they arrange themselves instinctively
in effective group by a fence.
PASHLEY delighted. "Awfully intelli-
gent little beggars!" he says. "They
seem to know exactly what I want."
They also know exactly what they want,
for the moment they hear the camera click,
they make a rush at us, sternly demanding
five cents a head for their services.
SHIRTLIFF very severe with them; not
one copper shall they have from him; not
a matter of pence, but principle, and they
had better go away at once. They don't;
they hustle him, and some of the taller
girls nudge him viciously in the ribs with
sharp elbows, as a hint that " an immediate
settlement is requested." PASHLEY and I
do the best we can, but we soon come to
the end of our Dutch coins. However, no
doubt English pennies will Not a
bit of it! Even the chubby infants don't
consider them legal tender here, and reject
them with open scorn.
I.BY, when we are safely on board our sail-
ing boat, to which we have effected a rather
ignominious retreat, "what I like about
Marken is the beautiful simplicity and un-
worldliness of the natives. Didn't that
strike vow, SHIRTLIFF?"
We gather from SHIRTLIFF'S reply that
he failed to observe these characteristics.
"WHA.T PRICE PATRIOTISM?"

"Capital!" responded the representative
of the Government.
"And then guns and ammunition could
be supplied with limitless celerity," shouted
a third.
"Admirable!" was again the commen-
ta*y.
Then came a silence. The eloquent
oratory for the moment was exhausted.
The Statesman "hemed" and "hated"
for a moment.
"And tow about the cost ?" he ventured
to suggest at last.
"Oh, that will have to be paid by the

THERE is another way that none may tread
But whoso has a halo round his head;
Who, whether Nature leaves his apex bare
Or nicely coated with a wealth of hair,
Arranges, like the milking-maid, to base
The nucleus of fortune on. his face.
Expressly chartered at a lordly wage,
He stands in beauty's strength upon the
Perusing to a fine and cultured crowd
His own selected efforts out aloud,
Or lecturing Uie literary Press
Upon the methods which command suc-
cess—
Maidens that dote and women that adore
All drinking in his charms at every pore.
Dight in a dress that suits the brilliant
scene,
Rich knickerbockers wrought of velveteen,
Or else in evening-wear whose very hem
Scarce would the London Tailor dare con-
demn,
Awhile he poses in a weary trance
To give the wonder-stricken pit a chance,
Then, if he boasts the kind of hairy crown
Which means an extra forty dollars down,
Just runs his fingers through the wavy crop
While in the hush you hear a hair-pin drop;
Till with a studied smile of high disdain
He breaks at last the agonising strain,
Lifts up his tawny voice and lets it go,
And in a burst of passion blent with woe,
Where all the notes of nightingales occur,
Becomes (like Heaven) his own Interpreter.
There is to prophets, so I understand.
A certain charm in some one else's land;
For when our native products cross the
sea
They are devoured with more avidity.
That is to say, in doing foreign nations
The author runs to higher valuations;
His figure being only vaguely known,
They very kindly take him at his own;
Which estimate is entered in the bond
And backed by BARNUM'S or by Major
POND.
Whereas, at home, it is another case,
For there we see the prophet's frequent
face;
Perchance we have that best of annual
treats
When the Society of Authors eats;
Or find him feeding in a friendly way
At houses where you haven't got to pay.
And if from oversight, or other reason,
Patrons omit to ask him in the season,
We still may hope—most happily for us—
To brush against him in an omnibus;
Or sometimes even see him in the street
Fanning the pavement with his winged
feet;
Where anybody IUIH a perfect right
To watch him till he trickles out of sight.
But over there, where people read his
books,
But know not, save in pictures, how he
looks,
Where still the hero draws a fancy price
For sniffing up the fumes of sacrifice,
There men will freely fling the careless
dollar
Simply to see a section of his collar,
Girding the sacred column which sustains
The beetling bulk of those abnormal
brains—
A sight that well repays the entrance-pelf,
Being an education in itself ;—
Will sit on wooden planks, in mortal
anguish,
To watch the poet's lovely glances languish;
Will cross a continent's complete expanse,
To scan the brow that schemed the brave
romance;
And die of suffocation just to wring
The veritable hand that wrote the thing.
Thus may be worked, with small expense
of wit,
The Man-and-Author's Mutual Benefit;
For such as read the tatter's verse or prose
Will take a stall to view the former's nose;
While those that pay to see the Man's
complexion
Will go and buy the Author's whole col-
lection.
What wonder, then, if, there across the
main,
RICHARD LE NABCISSE* is himself again,
And tonsured ANTHONY, our only Hope,
With this temptation really could not cope.

MadtmowdU. "WHEN ONE DOES NOT KNOW, ONE SAYS MADAME, s'tsr ex PAS, MONSIEUR?"
AS NOW WORN; OR, THE GENTS' ARBITER OF FASHION.
Now that the Golden Youth, it appears, have their own
fashion-paper, it is quite incumbent on Mr. Punch to publish
a column for the guidance of the inexperienced in the all-im-
portant matter of male costume. Every one being now out of
town, the following remarks are chiefly for the benefit of seaside
and country readers : —
DEAB BASIL,—Silk hats may now be put away for a few weeks.
The black cloth band should be removed, as it has had its day,
and a cordon noir of silk, exactly one-and-a-quarter inch in
width, should be substituted. Oil the chapeau slightly and wrap
in tissue paper. With a little care it may be made to do for the
Autumn. If the edges are worn, they may be very successfully
renovated with Messrs. RAMONBURS' Brim-Blackener. I do not
recommend for this purpose the eye-brow grease-paint used by
actresses, as this has a tendency to come off in a shower, and it
is as well to avoid having sable streaks across one's countenance.
See that your head-gear ia well blocked before being put away
for the recess, as it may be required for a school-treat or a sud-
den emergency, and an accordion shape is not favoured in the
best circles. I prophesy that next winter's mode will be the
caxtor americain.
Fashion still smilea on the straw-hat, and has temporarily
relegated the bowler to the background. I saw a charming
chapeau de paitte the other day worn, by a debutant on the East-
bourne Esplanade. The straw was in two thicknesses, jaune on
the upper side of the brim, and verte underneath, casting a very
IM'coining; green shade over his complexion. A risque note was
added to this confection. I noticed the vivid scarlet and green
colours of the best of the Bohemian Clubs peeping through a
slit in the black ribbon round the hat.
Cravates are worn this season as usual round the neck. Some
of the best-dressed mondains are having them made of beige or
:oulard in the new chouflftir design. Do not let them ruck over
the back of the collar. This is too neglige. They may be pinned
on to the front of the shirt, though this rather spoils the look
of the shirt-front, if you require it for evening-dress. It is as
well, therefore, always to have a spare clean shirt, and this should
not be beyond the means of the fashionable aspirant.
If your collars or shirts are at all frayed at the edges, have
then neatly trimmed. You can generally beg or borrow a pair
of nail-scissors for this purpose. Iron-mould spots should always
be carefully aspinalled in a dead white tint. It ia almost im-
possible then for them to be detected.
Frock-coats, at this time of the year, should be sprinkled with
pepper or camphor (to keep away the moth) and stowed away
securely. No dubbiste who is bi«n mis will appear on the sands
or elsewhere in public in such a garment combined with white
flannels and a straw hat. Yet, I regret to say, I have seen
this done.
Now is the time to use Messrs. KNICK-NACKS' Patent Anti-bag
Trouser-stretchers. Truly wonderful effects are sometimes pro-
duced by these invaluable accessories to a genteel wardrobe.
Never be seen with worn-out and unravelled trouser-ends. Let
them invariably be repaired by the local snip. Do not, however,
start on a round of visits without an extra ten-and-«ixpenny pair.
Borrowed continuations somehow never look well.
Knickerbockers are not without their advantages. They can
readily be constructed out of unmentionables that have seen
their day, and may sometimes be very effectively patched, so as
to look like riding-breeches. This gives the distinguished ap-
pearance, which no modern elegant can afford to neglect.
I have some useful wrinkles on cummerbunds, hat-guards, and
paper cuffs, also a marvellous recipe for removing the shiny look
from cloth, but I regret that considerations of space prevent me
giving them at present.
So, much against my will, I bring this interesting letter to a
conclusion—for the present. Man has at length found his destiny
—to dress. With sincere regards, Yours ruralising,
By the sad sea waves. ZBDWHYBKS.

A POLITE EDUCATION.
(Vide an article, "A plea for better instruction in Manners," in the .
current "Nineteenth Century.")
IN obedience to your instmctions, writes our own Prophetical
Interviewer, 1 journeyed to Chesterfield College, where our boy;
are taught that studied courtesy of manner, which, it is now
recognised, is a far more necessary part of education than
classics or mathematics. I was received by the Principal, who
took great, pains to explain his system to me.
"Yes," he said, in answer to my questions, "the greatest
trouble is taken to ensure that every pupil shall be taught the
very best kind of manners. Not only are lectures given daily
on deportment and the art of polite conversation, but we see
that thn principles laid down are carried out even in play-tin}e.
In old days the conversation of boys while playing cricket or
football used to be disgracefully crude and unpolished, but if
you will kindly accompany me, I think I can show you how we
have improved this feature of school-life."
So saying, lie led the way to the cricket-ground, where the
pupils of Chesterfield College were engaged in the national game.
As I approached, one of the batsmen put away a ball through
the slips.
"May Tenquire, Sir," he asked, addressing the batsman at the
other end, "whether in your opinion we should be justified in
attempting .a run?"
"I fear it is impossible,"'replied the other, which indeed it
was, as by the time these speeches were finished, the ball was in
the wicket-keeper's hands. However, both batsmen kept up
their wickets, and the captain decided to make a change.
"SMITH Minor," he observed, addressing the bowler, "with
nfinite pain I am compelled to ask you to hand over the ball to
BROWN."
SMITH Minor bowed profoundly, and replied, "My greatest
happiness, Sir, is to carry out your commands." And accord-
ngly BROWN went on to bowl. Shortly afterwards, one of the
ratsmen put up an easy chance to point, who, however, failed to
lold the ball. "Butterfingers!" screamed a small boy in the
out-field. The Principal turned towards him, angrily.
"Go indoors, Sir!" he cried, "and write out two hundred
lines for addressing one of your fellow-pupils in that unseemly
manner."
Presently a ball struck a batsman's pad.
"How 's that ?" asked the bowler.
"JOHNSON !" cried the Principal, warningly.
"I mean to say," said the bowler, hastily correcting himself,
"may I trouble you for your views as to the respective positions
of the baUtnon's leg and the wicket?"
The Principal looked at me for approval. "Wonderful what
on improvement our system makes, isn't it?" he said, "and it's
so strange that the old barbarous language was tolerated at
schools for so many years."
I congratulated him on his success and prepared to leave. As
I did so, .1 noticed for the first time an inscription over the
College gateway.
"That," said the Principal, "is an adaptation of a motto be-
longing to one of the schools of the bad old kind. It runs, you
Bee, 'Mannerisms Makyth Prigs.'"
WILL LONDON WAIT ?—And if so, for how long, before the daily
increasing ruffianism of the London "Larrikins," thieves, and
roughs, both of the East and West End, is summarily dealt with and
put down by force majeitre? The sufferers in these districts are
"intimidated," and dare not come forward to give evidence.
According to the magistrate, a scoundrel may have his fingers
in somebody else's pockets, but unless he succeeds in actually
abstracting a halfpenny, he cannot be sentenced as a thief!
Don't »pare the cat, and then you 'II spoil the little game of
thieving, murderous Larrikin. If the magistrates' hands are so
weak, let them be strengthened at once. Peace-abiding, police-
supporting, rate-paying citizens are forced to form themselves
into bodies of " specials" with police-drill. Why not patrol these
districts with volunteers doing sentry-duty, and provided with a
stout truncheon in place of side-arms? Probably, as is our way
in England, no drastic measure will be adopted until murder
has placed one, of these ruffians of the Larrikin type in the hands
of Mr. John Ketch. It seems that the magisterial and police
policy is to give these pests as much rope as possible in the hope
that they 'II get one more length of hemp added to it on the
gallows. But surely, is not prevention far better than cure?

SPEED THE PARTING QUEST.
"I have done the Stata some lervice, and they know "t."
Othello, Act V., Sc. 1.
Mr. Punch (with real emotion, to retiring American Ambassador).
"QoOD-Bnt, YOUR EXCELLENCE, AND OOOI) LUCK OO WITH YOU.
YOU WON T FORGET US ON THE OTHER SIDE?"
OSTEND.
THERE are several ways of getting through the day at Ostend,
where the day is about as long as at other seaside resorts, or per-
haps rather longer. The simplest plan is to sit in the morning
on the terrace of the Kursaal and chatter, till it is time to go to
dejeuner, to do the same in the afternoon, till it is time to go to
dinner, and to repeat this amusement in the evening, till it is
time to go to bed. The next morning you begin again. In this
way you avoid all needless exertion.
Another plan is, in the morning, to stand in the sea. If you
are very brave you go in up to your waist, and if you are very
strong you splash a little water on your chest, but you never
wet your head for fear of hurting your hair. You may wear a
straw hat as a protection from the sun, and, if you are a German,
you may add a pair of spectacles. The only disadvantage of this
plan is that about four thousand people want the four hundred
bathing-machines. If you are a woman, you flounder about on wet
sand and never get a cabine at all. If you are a man, you take off
your boots and socks, wade in up to your knees, and pursue the
machine in the water. The chasse aujc cabinet is fine exercise,
but it is hardly luxurious. By standing in the sea you begin the
day comfortably cool. In the afternoon you stand on the race-
course, the pigeon-shooting ground, the pier, or the promenade,
or you can sit down if you like. These pastimes make you con-
siderably warmer. In the evening you have a choice of two
places to stand in. One of them is the dancing-room of the
Kursaal, where the temperature is about ninety degrees. You
can dance if you wish. The other is the gambling-room, where
the temperature is about one hundred and fifty degrees. You
stand here in a dense crowd, reach over the heads of the few who
have obtained chairs, and lose as many louis as you like.
A third system is to linger over your caft-au-lait till it is
nearly time for dejeuner, to prolong your dejeuner with coffee
and liqueurs until about the time of the firocklock, when you
have a glass of port, or a scherry gobbler, and, beginning dinner
soon after seven, to go on with this till half-past ten, or later,
when all the other diners have left the restaurant, and the weary
waiters have piled all the other chairs upon all the other tables.
But this system will ruin your system after a time.
It is believed by some that there are excellent concerts in the
Kursaal every evening from 7.30 to 9. But to hear them at such
an impossible time one must go without dinner altogether, which
no one can do. In fact, there is reason to believe that nobody
ever did get to these concerts. Once, when VANDERBLANK and
1 had rather hurried over our coffee and cigarettes in his vtranda
—the verandas of Ostend are very pleasant in hot weather—we
arrived at the Kursaal just in time to see some men with violins
disappearing from the orchestra. Since then I have considered
myself rather an authority on the Ostend concerts, having got
as near hearing one as that. ROBINSON THE ROVER.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IF the title had not be appropriated in quite other regions,
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD might well, my Baronite imagines, have
called her last novel The Runaway Girl. At all critical epochs
of her interesting life the heroine of Helbeck of liannisdale
(SMITH, ELDER) runs away. Thus she bolts when her unwel-
come lover, Hubert Manon, wants to conduct her over the sands.
5he flies from Banni&dale after she has accepted the offer of its
lord's hand; and at last No, it would not be fair even to
nut at the " at last." But this is so frivolous, and there is nothing
of frivolity about this story. It is rather a stately narrative of a
profound tragedy in two human lives. Both are skilfully drawn.
Laura Fountain, with her bright nature, her capacity for over-
whelming love, and her agnostic training; Helbeck, a bit of old
bapestry hung on the walls of a nineteenth century room. He
has depths of love even more plumbless than she, and he is a
Catholic born and bred, a man with a private chapel attached to
his ancient home, where mass is said every morning, the house
swarming with priests. It will be seen that here is a difficult
situation, rough-hewn and finished with a master hand.
Vicky Monteith, by TOM GALLON (where's HARRY? HUTCHIN-
SON, the publisher, my Baronite supposas, makes up the immortal
triumvirate), is none of your novels with a purpose, freckled
with women with a past. It is a right-down, downright melo-
dramatic story, in which the wicked are punished even in this
world, and injured innocence comes to its own. Dicky is an
amiable, good-hearted, not particularly strong-headed fellow,
who has muddled away his own and other people's money. After
which, he works apparently twenty-four hours a day, earns very
little, and shares it with the poor. A leading character in the
transpontine plot is a little maid, a cross between the slavey in
Our Soys and Dick Swiveller'i unapproachable friend, the
Marchioness. Also there is a guardian-angel sort of young lady,
who thinks nothing of surreptitiously conveying to the man she
loves mysterious envelopes containing notes for £100, and
finally draws a cheque tor £2,500 to save him from what the
little maid aforesaid calls "the Coppers." A pretty story, with
plot skilfully complicated. THE BARON DE B.-W.
FURTHER RULES REGULATING THE CONDUCT OF BARRISTERS.
(AW submittal at the Recent General Mi-ding, but fen- me during the
Long Vacation.)
A COUNSEL finding himself in the presence of laymen, must lay
down the law on every conceivable subject.
In carrying the above aim into execution, he will set a General
right about Army concerns, a sailor about things appertaining to
the Navy, and a civilian upon all other matters.
To keep up the dignity of the profession, a barrister must
never permit himself to be contradicted, and insist upon his word
being accepted as law.
As a matter of professional etiquette, it is undesirable to give
your opinion upon any point of law unless you are quite sure
that you know nothing whatever about it.
It is advisable to be civil to the other branch of the profession,
save in public, when you must remember that your right of
audience in the superior courts does not run to the solicitors.
Although self-conceit is to be deprecated, it is well to remem-
ber that although officers of the Army and Navy are better
educated than they used to be, culture in its highest form is the
exclusive property of the Bar.
If a counsel meets another counsel without recognising his
forensic degree while they are both engaged in discussing an
acquaintance in Common's dinner, he will oppose his fellow guest
to the death until he discovers his mistake, when he will join his
"learned friend" in sitting upon the rest of the company.
Finally, all men are equal, as a rule, but a barrister is in-
variably an exception in particular.

excellent refreshment, consisting of a table d'hote lunch in the

of our special ordering. Here, by open window, we sit, enjoy-
ing the sea-scape and the sand-scape, the bathing, and the
breeze, and the startling sight of the tide rushing in, at top
speed, as though it were very much behind time, and would
wait for no man, woman, or child, but meant to catch 'em,
unless they would cut and race for their lives, and intended to
give them a good sea-bath whether they liked it or no. After
the dejeuner a, la fourchette came I'addition a la "fork out."
"Bang goes saxpence," but 'tis money well spent.
Then, like joyous ghosts, we seek the shades and stagger to
umbrageous retreats offered by the gardens of the establishment.
There, within cheerful sound of electric-tram bells, and of the
soothing steam-whistles of the many bateaux a vapeur coming
in and going out, we doze the happy hours away. Then

feet order was kept, in our quarter, at all events, which repre

still alive, and there are excursion boats and trains departing
whistling and shrieking.
"Up in the morning early," Monday, and by the tram, up hill,
to the Cathedral, where, being ever ready to improve and tesl
our acquaintance with a foreign language, we, having wedgec
ourselves into the perspiring crowd, were jostled into the
building, and deposited in a side-aisle. Here, having deftly
accommodated ourselves with a chair, we commanded a view o:
the pulpit, in which suddenly appeared a long-bearded Franciscan
"in his habit as he lived," evidently bent on giving his audience
something like a sermon. For us the discourse would be a valu
able lesson " in French as she is spoke," all for the small sum ol
one halfpenny paid for our seat. A scratching of chair-legs on
the paved floor, an unsettling and resettling of everybody "rounc
and about our quarter," who, by turning their backs on the
bishops, curates, and several chapters of deans and canons seatec
at the East end of the Cathedral, clearly indicated to them thai
their turn would come later on when they had finished with the
gentleman in brown, who now occupied the pulpit and their
entire attention. The sermon began. In a low voice at first;
and we, listening intently and following every word with a
sort of mental grammar and dictionary, were suddenly startled
by loud chanting in the distance, and the rumbling of an unseen
organ. What could it be? Bishops, curates, deans, and canons, all
the ecclesiastics in the choir, turned round, momentarily startled.
Had an organ got loose anywhere? Was there a revolution
headed by choir boys? Could a Salvation Army have invaded
the sacred precincts? But the Franciscan preacher cared for
none of these things. Like a second St. Anthony, whose equa-
nimity "shouts nor laughter, groans nor cries" could ever
disturb, he braced himself up to full concert pitch, and then
and there backed himself and his naturally-powerful organ against
all the choirs of all the pilgrims, accompanied by all the mechan-
ism that any number of organists could bring into play. The
struggle was Titanic. The louder the preacher shouted, the more
powerful was the volume of sound proceeding from the hidden
organs and from the "choirs invisible." All chance of improving
either our French, or our minds, by the sermon, was utterly
gone: our interest was centred in the battle between Organ
and Orator. In vain the ecclesiastical dignitaries tried to look
as if their whole attention was being given to the preacher; the
attempt was manifestly a failure, and after a brief consultation,
a Canon went off (this didn't add to the noised, evidently
damp, or, rather, tone down, the exuberant enthusiasm of the
pilerims who, just arrived at the extreme East end, were bliss-
fully unconscious of what wns going on in the West. Sturdily
the Franciscan went on his eloquent way, ignoring all interrup-
tion, "speaking through music," and making himself heard every-
where; he riveted the attention of the immense crowd, who had
clearly laid odds on his winning, and as the interruptions sud-
denly ceased, his robust eloquence asserted itself triumphantly,
and he stood there, arms uplifted, a living picture of Perseverance
Rewarded!
After more "food and feeding,"—of which even Sir HENRY
THOMPSON would have approved,—we bade "Au plnisir" to
courteous and energetic Manager FABESCH and his Most Civil
Service company, and, catching the refreshing bree7,es, we re-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE BROWNS HAVE NOT TIT BERN ABLE TO oo TO SWITZERLAND THIS YEAR, BUT IT 's NEAELY AS GOOD GETTING TO
THEATRE NOW THAT THE STRAND is "UP."
THE COMPLETE STOBY WEITEE.
i.
THE reader, let us suppose, is one of
the many thousands who wish to become
popular authors. You desire, for instance,
to see a tale of yours in the pages of
that favourite monthly, the Sixpenny Sit.
The simplest method of effecting this is to
write a romantic series of the kind now in
fashion, which, with luck, you will be able
to spread over a dozen numbers of the
magazine. Care should be taken to give
your hero a striking name, as this will
form the title. A snort specimen is ap-
pended by way of example:
JEREMIAH JINKS.
XXII.—The Affair of the Hard-boiled Eggs.
For some time after the Incident of the
Lost Tiara (vide the last number of the
Sixpenny Bit) tranquillity reigned in the
Court of Boshia. From this time, indeed,
his Majesty did me the honour to regard me
as his confidential friend. He had already
thrust a cheque for £500,000 upon me as
"a slight reward," to use his own phrase,
"for my devoted loyalty," and (although
the Bank most unaccountably refused to
honour the cheque) I felt that I was rich
indeed in possessing the regard of so es-
timable a monarch.
So, feeling secure of his favour, I did
not hesitate to enquire about a month later
whether any fresh trouble was brewing,
for I had observed at breakfast that morn-
ing that his face wore an air of settled
gloom.
The king started as I put the question,
and, placing his finger on his lip, silently
beckoned to me to follow him. Touching
a secret spring in the wall, which caused
a panel to slide smoothly back, he led the
way into his own room, where he sat down
in an arm-chair before the fire-place, and
placed the royal legs on the chimney-piece.
"Ah ! my dear JERRY," he remarked (for
he invariably addressed me in this friendly
way), "your eagle eye is as acute as ever!
There is fresh trouble afoot, and you must
help me put of it."
With irrepressible emotion I lifted the
king's right foot from the mantelpiece and
pressed it to my lips. "Your Majesty has
but to command," I said. "So long as the
editor will stand it and the public read it,
so long will I perform a deed of valoui
once a month on your behalf I"
"I knew it," said the king, gratefully.
"Well, then, my dear JERRY, the trouble,
in two words, is—hard-boiled eggs!"
I started to my feet. "What?" I ex-
claimed. "Hard-boiled again? Then
Count CHIMBORAZO means mischief yet!"
"Marvellously talented man!" said the
king, looking at me in amazement. "You
have guessed the truth. CHIMBORAZO is
still hoping to drive me from the throne.
You are aware that, by an ancestral
oath, if eggs are served hard-boiled at my
breakfast twice in succession, I am bound
to kill the cook, but if three times, to put
the queen to death. And my eggs, both
yesterday and to-day, were as hard as brick-
bats!"
"And you have?"

SHOULD WIVES WORK P
"WHAT ARE THE WILD Wivts SAYING!"
Probably, now thai they come to think of it
—after hearing of the Correspondence in th»
"D. T."—"Leisure and light refreshments."
The king nodded. "Yes, the cook was
executed an hour ago—that doesn't mattei
in the least, cooks are cheap enough. But
if the new cook—and I believe CHIMBORAZO
has bribed them all—gives me a hard egg
to-morrow, I shall have to strangle the
queen, and then there '11 be the very doose
to pay. Can't you help me out?"
"Speak net," I entreated. "Let me
think—let me think!"
I thought for four hours, nineteen min-
utes and twenty-five seconds, during the
whole of which time the king watched me
with indescribable anxiety. At the end of
the period I said simply:
"All shall be well. Boshia's king shall
be safe. To-morrow will his eggs be soft,
boiled!"
* • * • •
The fateful day had dawned. Skflfullj
disguised as a parlour-maid, I assisted the
new cook in the royal kitchen. At last
came the supreme moment; the gigantk
saucepan was on the fire, and in it the
cook deftly placed the three eggs designed
for the king's breakfast.
"They must on no account be hard," ]
said.
The cook turned upon me fiercely. "Thai
is my affair," he cried. "But, if you "re
so anxious, you can watch this minute-
glass, and take put the eggs yourself di-
rectly the two minutes are up!"
Anxiously I gazed at the trickling
sand. Would it never run through F
At length the last grain fell, and at
the same instant I whisked out the eggs.
To my amazement the cook roared with
derisive laughter. "Sold again!" he
shouted. "That is a five-minutes glass, yov
booby, so the king will have hard-boilet
eggs for the third time, and as sure ai
my name 's CHIH"
He stopped short, but a light flashe<
upon me. "Not so, base traitor!" I cried
"Not so easily can CHIMBORAZO dupe JERK
MIAH JENKINS !" and, seizing the strugglin)
count in my arms, I first tore off his cook'i
attire, and then dropped him, with a re
sounding splash, into the saucepan!
Thus it came about that the kingdom o
Bosbia was saved, and that I was that ver;
day made a Grand Knight of the moa
honourable Order of the Saucepan, by th<
grateful king.

A SUGGESTION FOR LLOYD'S.
DEAR ME. PUNCH,—I see by the papers
that a member of Lloyd's recently insured
the success of a play which proved to be
unsuccessful. It seems to me that there
are many projects which members of
Lloyd's might insure with equal daring.
I will instance a few schemes: —
1. Insurance against matrimony (widows
double premium).
2. Insurance against wet Bank Holidays,
or vice versa.
3. Insurance against the London County
Council ever suppressing street howling.
4. Insurance against the Government
ever regulating money-lending.
6. Insurance against naming the winners
of the Two Thousand Guineas, the Derby,
the St. Leger, and the Jubilee Stakes in
A.D. 1900.
6. Insurance against the total closing of
public-houses in England.
7. Insurance against colds and other
maladies contracted in the Law Courts.
8. Insurance against motor-cars doing
away, say in five years, with horse-drawn
vehicles.
9. Insurance against bicycles being
taxed and numbered (three years limit).
There, Sir, are nine subjects for specu-
lation, to which I beg to add a tenth.
Insurance against these valuable sugges-
tions appearing in Punch.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

THE night is drawing to a close,
And you have been too often fed
With 'baccy—I must seek repose
In bed.
It wracks my heart to lay you down
So soon. I really cannot do
Without one in my dressing-gown
Or two.
And then we part, as lovers sweet—
How fast time spent together slips!—
Till, breakfast done, again you meet
My lips.
Then let us banish parting's grief,
Hugging the present pure content,
Before your soothing power brief
Be spent.
I met you first within a shop,
Root-mottled to your silver mount;
Your cost, though great, I could not stop
To count.
I bore you off in triumph then,
And all the joy your beauty woke
Is constant, for I love you when
I smoke.
You soothe when trouble overmuch
Oppresses, Consolation's type—
No cigarette can ever touch
My pipe.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Knowing that you

of men and women, I venture to inquire
why my iiicognitu or incognita (I am not
a Latin scholar) should not be scrupulously
preserved? I arrived here a fortnight ago
in order to recuperate my health and duly
inscribed my name in the Fremden-litte as
the Countess of TRANSCAUCASIA, meaning
thereby to intimate that I did not desire
my personality to be made known to the
Outer World. So far from my modesty
assuring me of repose, I and those around
me have ever since been pestered with
queries from irresponsible scribes as to my
identity. I am—but no matter, you know
me—the Wearer of a Crown, but why
should I not descend to the level of a
Coronet without this never-ceasing outlook
on my movements? Please communicate
with Reuter, the Central News, the Agfnce

oblige Yours imperially,

A LAZY LAY.
IN weather that is tropical
The overheated bard,
To write on matters topical
Finds it extremely hard;
A sweltering sunny Summer's day
Somehow suggests a lazy lay.
When only sea is visible,
And blue skies shine above,
The rhyme that should be risible
Runs to a lay of love.
Tho" ddce far nitntf days
Turn, lays of love to love of laze.
When by the foreshore frollicking,
Or basking on the beach,
Rhymes racy and rhymes rollicking
Seem to escape one's reach;
The bard can only sing in praise
Of dear departing August days.

In some ways this wfll be a very good thing. Boys will, in
many cases, be spinsters from choice, and there will be no old
bachelors. Marriage will be more free and less trying. Also,
when once the boy is, like the girl, put into a way of earning
his own living, the responsibilities of the parents will be practi-
cally at an end. Only—where will wives come in? And should
husbands work?
We all know that husbands can work and do work, aye, that
husbands of all and every class get through a vast amount of
hard labour which is never paid for, and for which they get, and
ever will get, very little credit; but then the question arises,
When every man has his trade, who will do the work of the old
fashioned husband and father?
The answer may be suggested that it will do itself, as it has
always done! Yes, but will it? Of course, says the hopeful
prognosticator of the future, the working husband will have
his own proper assistants, he will have hi* own husband,
so to speak. He will be saved all the drudgery of the
old-fashioned man, he will rule his house as his wife now
rules her shop or office, he will have his own means, and will no
longer be compelled to sue his wife for every pound that he
needs. He will pay his share of the household expenses-^-accord-
ing as he may have agreed with his mate, for the word " wife " will
be as completely out of date as the phrase "better half "; he will
provide his own clothes, he will pay for his own cigars and a
share of the children's schooling. His will be a freer, wider, and
more happy life in every way. He will live, and every hour of
toil will tell, and will tell in his favour.
But the care and up-bringing of children is no joking matter,
and to speak seriously, if a father does his whole duty by his
children, to say nothing of his wife, how is he to find time and
strength to carry on also a profession of his own? Should hus-
bands work? Can any husband work and not feel the strain
thereof P
I put forward no shrieks, no plea; I hardly venture on a defi-
nite statement. But, good old Editor of the most popular news-
paper in the world, let the voice of the people speak, let us
have a real silly season boom on the subject—Should Husbands
Work? I am, yours obligingly,
Dieppe. BOOTLE'S SON-IN-LAW.
FROM THE SEAT OF WAR, OR THEREABOUTS.
(By the Special of the Future, according to the Prophecy of
Grumblers of the Past.)
I DARESAY by this time you have received a full account of the
late battle by the officer in command. However, no doubt you
will have discounted a great part of it, knowing as you do it is
his statement and not mine.
Of course, I have been obliged to obey and keep in the rear,
following the events of the campaign at a considerable distance
from the front. I must repeat that I consider the General's
objection that my train took up too much room frivolous. What
was it? A couple of camels, a horse or two, and half-a-dozen
servants! Not much where an army is concerned. I hear that
the General said that a lot of other fellows wanted to come too.
But why? So long as I was allowed at the front what did it
matter what became of the rest? But there, that grievance
has been sufficiently discussed. All I have to tell you is about
the recent battle. Well, I think it was a mistake—a decided
m'staVe.
So far as I could make out the infantry advanced en echelon,
supported by the cavalry and artillery. This was absurd, and
ought not to have been successful. Whether it was or not I do
not know, as we specials have not been able to get at the wires.
The General says there is no time to look over our copy, and
even if there were—what good is it? Nice way to speak of
correspondents, isn't it? But let that pass. I have to do my
duty, to send you the best account of the battle within my
power.
Well, so far as I could see, the army advanced in the forma-
tion I have described. Ridiculous! If there had been a cavalry
charge it would have cleared the ground of the enemy's skir-
mishers, and then the artillery might have made some practice.
This would have demoralised the hostile force fronting them.
Then when the fee were at sixes and sevens I would have ad-
vanced the infantry at the double, and, with a true British cheer,
carried the position at the point of the bayonet. That's how I
would have won the battle—and a good way, too!
Now, whether the General has been successful I don't know. I
•»m miles in the rear, and whenever I try to get near I am requested
to retire. "For military reasons!" Yes, I know!
However, I have one consolation—I am well in advance of the
other fellows. And what is more, my telescope is more powerful
than theirs, so I can see more of what is going on than they. So
far as I can make out, things are in a nice muddle. I believe
the commissariat has broken down. Then there seems—so far
as I can make out through my telescope—to be a scarcity of
water. It is no good suggesting there is a lack of discipline
because the Public know that the British soldier is always the
British soldier. TOMMY ATKINS is far too popular to be run
down by anybody. Not that I would attempt it, for I respect
him as much as any of my countrymen. So all I will say is,
that he has behaved magnificently—in trving circumstances.
And now, what more can I write? I fancy the General would
like me to talk about the stars. Well, if I did, it should not
be the K.C.B. How the public are getting on without any
descriptions I am sure I don't know. What is the use of a war
unless it is reported in the papers? It seems to be looming in
the future, that when hostilities commence, the Press will have
to provide the army to fight the battles of our country. There
is plenty of enterprise, and it might easily be managed. With
our own journalistic army we could have our own journalistic
reporters.
In the meanwhile, kept as we are in the rear, our berth is
safer than it used to be. But that is not of much consequence
as there is none of us who would not dare death to secure copy.

THE SKETCHING-CLUB SEASON.
MR. WENLEY DAUUIES RISOLVES TO WRITE TO THE PAPERS RK
OARDINO AN ABNORMAL GROWTH OF FUNGI WHICH HAS SPRUNG Ul
ON THE DOWNS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HIS HOME IN WOLD-
BOROUOH, Sl'SSEX.
ALLER ET RET OUR.
FROM the Kent coast to Ostend. Better is it by far to de-
scend on foreign coasts, making flying visits, oiler et retour,
than to take a long tour abroad. To Boulogne at one time,
next, to Flushing, and round about, and on a third occa-
sion, to Ostend and Bruges. You start with a bag,
artfully packed, that will serve you for three days at least,
portable, so that you can carry it in your hand, and thus, if
necessary, be independent of porters and commissionaires. No
matter what season of the year it may be, go on board early, and
with admirable forethought, secure the shadiest and best pro-
tected spot on deck for your seat. Next, descend at once, see
the chief steward, secure your table, and order your lunch.
Should any one of your genial party feel in the least undecided
as to his, or her, sea-faring qualifications, take care that the festive
board be prepared a good quarter of an hour before the start,
at 12.20, or thereabouts, and on the return passage (from Ostend
;o Dover at 11 A.M.), let your hour of dejeuner be 11.45 at latest.
Fortified by a good meal, and with the tide and wind in your
'avour, the average traveller ought to enjoy the trip immensely.
Cuisine and service excellent on these Belgian boats; Rood
Viersteiner, coffee excellent, and price generally average. These
details may be of considerable use to the considerable minority
able to enjoy a sea voyage.
In and out of season we have "done" Ostend, and in the
season, Ostend would be delighted to "do" us, were we not
wary old birds of passage, not to be lured by the hotel-keeper's
and shop-keeper's bait, charm they never so wisely. Ostend,
in full swing of its season, is a mixture of Brighton, East-.
bourne, and Dieppe, but as freshening and as hot, too, as Mar-1
gate. Along the digue, most of the hotels are magnificent, a
the private houses (taken for the season) are so built as
suggest that the ground-floor, several steps above the street lev
with alcove and draperies, is a sort of little stage with the see
set, showing an "interior luxuriously furnished, with opening
back leading into another interior," as theatrical directions wou
express it. In some houses this arrangement suggests the id
of-a gorgeous Punch and Judy show, especially as only the upi
half of the people appearing on the balcony, leaning over a
talking to friends in the street, is visible; Punch, with sque
and cudgel, is wanted, and, to complete the resemblance, tht
should be the other puppets, who could be knocked on the he
one after the other on to the ledge in front.
For our part, we put up at a comfortable and reasonable hoi
(such hostelries are to be found), not ten minutes from the dig\
presided over by a most polite manager, got-up somewhat after t
style of a ring-master in FRANCONI'S circus. The style in whic
during the Inlili- d'hote dinner, he clapped his hands as a signal
a small regiment of waiters, every one of these with a dish in 1
hand, and all rushing into the room, in a line, at the rate
ten miles an hour, was a thing to be seen and never to
forgotten. What rehearsals he must have given them! He w
a regular Grand Vizier of the Arabian Nights, who "clapp
his hands, and a thousand ebon slaves responded to the summon;
Advice to the Town Council.—Have the carillon tuned, ai
put in a few fresh airs. The Grande Duchesse is played 01
As there is a steam-tram through the streets, which takes you
Blankenberghe, and other trams as well, bell-ringing, trumpet
and shrill whistles, are not absolutely unknown to Ostend. T
digue, however, is free from trams, which, in their place, and
their places, are most convenient.
From Ostend, in twenty-five minutes you are in Bruges, an
being there, you will find that a single visit only whets the app
tite tor seeing all that Bruges has to show. Spend most of yo
day here, and, in the evening, return to Ostend for the conce
and the amusements, including the somewhat monotonous gar
of barraque, played in the public rooms. The highly respectal
visitor can vary the entertainments by getting a friend on ti
premises to vouch for his immaculate position in Society, ai
then and there to write his name down; thus the entree to tl
Cercle is obtained, where, at trente et qvarante and baccarat, ti
visitor in quest of excitement can pass the happy hours away.
Then the bicycles and the costumes! The Belgian bicycli
is a beautiful sight, and the bicycliste is dazzling I No "scorchers
here, but flashes of lightning, radiations from the rainbow sit t ii
well, and working as if there were nothing half so sweet in li
as its wheel. A compatriot bicyclist, who had done himat
many good turns in various lands, informed me that the Belgu
Government had framed regulations for bicyclists, which at fir
sight appeared irksome to a foreigner, but on closer acquaintanc
it would be found that these rules were anti-scorcher regulation
and any Englishman who would take the precaution of becornii
a member of the Cyclist Touring Club, would find the formaliti
at Belgian douants considerably simplified and shortened. 1.
was enthusiastic about the roads and the civility of the count]
people. As, however, I subsequently heard him holding an ar
mated conversation with a Belgian official in Flemish, and th<
arguing a point about WAGNER with a German at the Kursas
breaking off to order, in French, mysterious beverages of
waiter, I came to the conclusion tfcat my bicycling friend po
sessed such linguistic advantages as, coupled with extreme aff
bility, would smooth the way for him in many rough placi
through which the less gifted would only pass with considerab
friction. Ah! but " gie me Peebles for pleasure," and the qui
of Bruges,—some people call it dulness, we don't,—is a genuii
relief after the hurly-burly of Ostend.

THE GUARDS OF RIGHT.
THE skies are dark, the mist is dense,
We cannot see our way,
A pressure that is chill, intense,
Has hidden all our day!
We know the foe is somewjuere near
Beneath this blinding blight
Of doubt, uncertainty, not fear—
Stand fast, 0 Guards of Bight!
Dimly the sun has kissed the East,
Dimly has kissed the West!
We 're bidden to the fateful feast,
Where War shall mato with Rest.
A cry comes forth from out yon gloom
That should be dove-like, whit*,
"Sheathe swords! suppress the cannon
boom!"
Stand fast, 0 Guards of Bight!
The promises of broken faith
On Sands of Time are strown,
We bought those promises with Death.
What sowed them? Blood! our own!
Across the seas, on every strand
The bones of men bleach white,
The Sign-posts of our Mother-land!
Stand fast, 0 Guards of Bight!
Stand fast! nor heed the whining cry
Of curs, who fear the foe,
Of women, who would fain deny
That God had made them so!
Stand fast! for all that Britain's worth!
Stand fast! amid this night!
You hold the Peace of all the Earth!
Stand fast, 0 Guards of Bight!

(A Vision of the tfenr Future.)
"No foreign trips," said JONES, reso-
lutely. "None of your miserable seaside
places for me this year. I shall spend my
time at Puddleworth, in the depths of the
country, staying in those delightful farm-
house lodgings where I was made so com-
fortable before. Mr. GILES, the fanner,
will be delighted to see me. his wife is an
admirable cook, and life there is thoroughly
primitive, simple and charming."
A few days later he arrived at Puddle-
worth, and very refreshing the country air
seemed after the stifling heat of London.
Farmer GILES greeted him warmly, and
after a few remarks about the weather—
a topic, JONES noticed, which seemed to
interest his host less keenly than was onoe
the case—the visitor enquired what kind
of a season it had been for hay.
"Well, Sir," said the worthy GILES,
"the hav was all right, but we couldn't
carrv it."
"But why?" enquired JONES. "Surely
the weather"
"It weren't the weather," said the
farmer; "'twere along o' that Shakspeare
class. We couldn't net no hands nohow."
"Shakspeare class?" echoed JONES, with
much surprise.
"Yes, Sir. P'raps you mayn't have
heard how we be moving on in the country.
Them there County Councils have started
lectures on every sort of subject, offering
prizes, and scholarships, and foolishness.
AH the place be clean overrun with them
dratted lectures—asking your pardon. Sir.

SPEARE," Tuesdays and Fridays 'tis "Ad-
vanced Sanitation," and Wednesdays we
has a course on "Applied Dynamics."

be. All those lectures be in the afternoon,
so we'can't get a man to do a day's work.
Then of an evening"
"But, good gracious!" cried JONES,
"you don't mean to tell me that the la-
bourers attend those lectures?"
"That they does," said Mr. GILES.
"They be that daft on 'culture,' and ' eddi-
cation,' and suchlike nowadays. Or, even
if they hain't fools themselves, for one
thing there's the County Council bribing
them handsome (out of the rates) to come,
and then there 's their women-folk egging
of them on. You've brought a cook, Sir,
I hopes?" he broke off.
"A cook?" said JONES, with dismay.
No ; why, I thought that Mrs. GILES"
"Lor* bless you, she don't cook nowa-
days. She spends her time a-reading
BROWNING, and the gals are learning paint-
ing and the violin. As for the food
Well, in the old days, as you knows, Sir,
we got what we could eat. Now we eat
what we can get—and be thankful, 01
otherwise, according to our digestions."
"And is your old father alive? And
so, what does he think of this system?"
"Father," said Mr. GILES, smiling fi
the first time, "is a sight for to see—1<
alone to hear. There's a new course i
lectures on WORDSWORTH, for " Infants at
Senile Adults," and parson's wife, she cart
along and dragged off father to the scho
for it. And the language the old genne
man used about 'lectures'! Well, yc
should have heard it, Sir."
"But what becomes of the farm, GILES?
"Farming hain't of no account now:
days," said Mr. GILES, decisively. "Missi
finds that American flour very good, an
our butter comes from Norway. We do<
a little ourselves, of course, so long as
don't interfere with lectures. And—'sous
me, Mr. JONES, but I 'm due at. one now-
'tis on "RtTSKiN and Ideal Art"—and m
missus, well, she just makes me go. Mai
yourself at home. Sir. There 's some brea
and cheese, and we '11 be back about nine!
But on his return, he found that JONI
had taken the 8.50 express for London.

chief. Row of heads thrust out of car-
tiage windows. Enquiries as to whether
accident has happened. Descend gingerly
and shake hands stiffly, trying to quell my
nephews. Quite useless. MAX rushes up,
dog yapping with excitement all the time,
horrid child hits me violently on back, and
cries, "Good old Uncle! won't we have
some real fun!" Shudder at thought.
Battle, murder and sudden death flit
across my mind in connection with their
ideas of "fun." TOMMY yells out, " Oh! the
dog's loose !" and away goes terrier up the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COMPLETE STORY WRITER,
n.
HAVING instructed the young author in
the art of constructing a tale of adventure,
we may next proceed to the short sensation
story. Nothing is more readily taken by
the editors of the popular magazines, and
the plan for making it is simplicity itself.
Begin in the most matter-of-fact manner, a
favourite scene being a club smoking-room.
Then introduce your supernatural element
in the shape of an enchanted box or dagger
or ring, to which a dreadful curse is at-
tached. Thereafter you simply pile up
horrors for as many thousand words as
your editor will s*and. A short example
is appended.
THE RING FROM THE TOMB.
It was nearly midnight, and only two
men remained in the smoking-room of the
Megarkerian Club, reposing in comfortable
arm-chairs before the fire, and drinking
the customary whiekey-and-soda.
"It is good to be in England once more,
remarked the elder of the two, famous
among Egyptologists as Professor HIEBO-
OLTPH. <rAnd now tell me your own news,
DICK; you 've heard all my yarns."
DICK JOHNSON blushed becomingly.
"Well, I'm going to be married next
month," he said.
"Indeed! I congratulate you! And the
lady's name?"
"AMARYLLIS JONES," answered DICK.
"Have you ever met her?"
The Professor grew deathly pale. Beads
of perspiration stood upon his brow, and
his face twitched convulsively. (The young
author should not use this last sentence
much more frequently than six times in
each sensation story.) Little did DICE
JOHNRON guess that, not two years before,
the Professor himself had wooed, quite
unsuccessfully, his own AMARYLLIS. (The
reader never wearies of this simple expe-
dient.)
"Yes," said the Professor at last, speak-
ing slowly and with evident effort. "I
—know—her—well." He placed his fingers
in his waistcoat pocket, and drew out a
small morocco case. "And here is a small
trifle—a ring I picked tip in the sarco-
phagus of RANDANABES THE SECOND—which
perhaps you will give Miss JONES as a
humble offering from an old friend."
DICK looked at the ring curiously; it
had mysterious letters engraved deep upon
its face. "Thank you, Professor," he said.
"AMARYLLIS shall have it to-morrow. And
I '11 wear it myself in the meantime," and
so saying, he slipped it upon the little
finger of his right hand, and walked out
of the room.
A terrible smile came over the Professor's
face as the other left. "So you think
that AMARYLLIS shall be yours, my friend?"
he muttered. "Not if the spell of RAN-
DANASES THE SECOND has aught of its
ancient power!"
He chuckled with unholy delight, while
beads of perspiration stood upon his brow,
and his face twitched convulsively.
* * * • *
(Note to the young author.—Now then,
for the horrors!)
As DICK JOHNSON walked home through
the night, a strange feeling began to grow
upon him, a quickening of pulse, a wild
desire to kill every passer-by. At last it
grew irresistible, and with a short howl
he flung himself upon an elderly policeman

'WOT AM I MOIKIN? BICYCLE, OF COURSE, STOOPID."
standing by the curb, and in an instant
had wrung his neck. Trampling the corpse
underfoot he passed on, a strange light
shone in his eyes, beads of perspiration
(Ac.). Well indeed was the ancient Egyp-
tian curse, buried for so many centuries
in the tomb of RANDANASES, doing its
dreadful work I In the course of the next
mile, DICK murdered—
(i.) A cabman.

He burst into the drawing-room, where
the beautiful AMARYLLIS still sat, late as
the hour was, writing letters to her dear
DICK. But her lover roughly repelled her
caress, when with a cry of joy she jumped
from her seat and flung her arms about
his neck.
"Look here, AMARYLLIS," he said,
bluntly, "this is a sensation story, and
I 'm bewitched, and I 'm going to kill you."
"OhI no," remonstrated the girl, "do

I HAVE sung in many places
Of My Lady's charms and graces,
I have frequently described her as my

But now in poetic phrases
I intend to chaunt the praises
Of another love, the nymph called Nicotine.
Tho' I trust my dearest lady
Will not think my conduct shady,
And with envy and with jealousy turn
green;
For the notion is distressing,
Yet I cannot help confessing
An attachment to the nymph called Nico-

I am not the only lover
Of the nymph, for round her hover
Worshippers too numerous to count, I
ween,
Young and old adoring gaily,
Whilst they offer incense daily
At the altar of the nymph called Nicotine.
Tho' her charms are great and many,
Of the fair sex scarcely any
In the ranks of her admirers will be seen,
But the simple, and th" gentle
Have a more than sentimental
Adoration of the nymph called Nicotine.
Then her worship is a pleasure,
For she speeds the hours of leisure,
And she makes our appetite for work more

If you are not too rapacious
She is never aught but gracious,
Sweetly soothing is the nymph called Nico-

MAIDEN, on whose gentle brow,
With the weight of woman's years,
Lies another burden now,
Rest a nation's hopes and fears, — •
See, we send across the foam,
Yours and ours that laughs between,
Greetings in your Lowland home,
Maiden-Queen!
Over half the world to-day
Deep in every loyal heart
Prayer is made that you may play
Like a queen your queenly part;
And of all that love your throne,
Truer none than we who trace
From your princely line our own
Royal race.
Yet we claim to be your kin
Bound by other bonds than these;
By the couratre wise to win
Fame and fortune from the seas;
By the strength that taught the world
What a fearless faith should be;
Bv the banner never furled
Of the Free.
Many a wave rolls o'er the dead
Since the conqueror of Spain,
With a broom at his mast-head,
Swore to sweep us from the main;
And, as now onr seamen go
Rival comrades down the deep,
Memories of that gallant foe
Still we keep.
Such the splendid warrior-breed,
Ladv, from whose blood you spring;
Such their sons that shall at need
All you ask of service bring:
So von stand as once she stood,
England's Queen, a simple maid,
In her dawn of womanhood
Unafraid.
And this ho'ir, when hearts are sent
Un to God in prayer for you,
Doubt not where her thoughts are bent
As remembrance lives anew;
How she smiles through happy tears,
Thinking what her life has been
Since her land at eighteen years
Crowned her Queen.
And she prays that yours may be
Such a heritage as hers,
Peace that onlv loyalty
Yielded by the heart confers;
With that other love, apart;
Ah! for what could well atone,
If you missed to have one heart
All your own?

DARBY JONES ON DONCASTER.
AFTER having my humble remarks on
Turf Indiscretion quoted in Big Type by
such an Illustrious Newspaper as the Daily
Telegraph, I feel, honoured Sir, like the
Czar of All the Russias must have felt
when his Patent-Peace-at-any-Price Bill
was seen, read and approved of by his
Illustrious Neighbour and Relative the
Emperor of All the Germanics. There is
nothing like Quotation after all to establish
a Man's Reputation. Most of our De-
ceased Statesmen have lived and do live
upon their Quotations and not on their
Sculptured Tombs in Westminster Abbey,
St. Paul's Cathedral, and other convenient
sepulchres. I would much prefer in my
own case that some now unborn Briton
should exclaim in the Paulo-post-futurum,
"DABBY JONES told this story in 1898,"
than that my Memory should be associated
with a Diseased Drinking Fountain, from
which the Unnecessary Cup had been pur-
loined by some Unscrupulous Teetotaler.
Not that I am vain enough to suppose that
any Member of Posterity will ever be
aware of the existence of " DARBY JONES,"
save as he exists in the Printed Catacombs
of Mr. Punch.
But away to the Delights of Doncaster,
leaving Cenotaphs, Epitaphs, and Mono-
graphs to the Historians of the Great War
which, if I be anything of a Tipster, will
break out immediately after the close of
the Paris Exhibition of A.D. 1900. I am
not a Politician, honoured Sir, the only
"Swing of the Pendulum" that I appre-
ciate is when a Big Backer gets the Knock
to his Tick in the Ring, the only "Open
door " that I understand is the Free Portal
to Tattersall's Enclosure, and the sole Ba-
lance of the parties with which I am ac-
quainted is Settling up on Mondays. But
nevertheless I am a Briton, and take it
from me, Sir, that if any Ready Money is
wanted to back the Empire of the QUEEN
in the Great International Stakes, it will
be largely found among the Promoters of
Sport, who throng HER MAJESTY'S vast
territory longitudinally and latitudinally
the wide world over. I am driven to these
Patriotic Reflections by the fact that at
Doncaster I have learnt that several large
parcels of that delicate sweetmeat known
as Butter-scotch have been despatched to
Dur Gallant Warriors in the Soudan, and
;hat these packages have been sent by
Turfites who know that TOMMY ATKINS
may have a sharp bayonet and a keen
iword, but that he also possesses a sweet
tooth. How small does the Globe seem
when we reflect that at the very moment
when the "Bellinger" is being decided,
some noble member of the Sirdar's army
may be chewing Doncaster toffee on the
banks of the Antique River of RAMKSKS.
I like Doncaster for one thing, and that
is its Independence. There is no truckling
to visitors, as happens in the Sordid South.
A Doncastrian landlord or landlady gives
you of the Best according to Doncastrian
ideas. If you don't like it, you can pack
up your grip-sack and depart elsewhere.
The Southron host or hostess would de-
ceive a British Ambassador with fair pro-
mises, but the Northerner is as uncom-
promising as Sir WILFRID LAWSON or Lady
HENRY SOMERSET. If you don't appreciate
the Whiskey of Doncaster return to less
Cultured Regions and get your Quencher
there. At Doncaster, too, there are many
Rough Elements, but the Roughs of Good-
wood, Epsom and Alexandra Park are un-
known, for the very excellent reason that
if they were to attempt any of their Romps
and Rigs they would be quietly suppressed,
possibly killed, by the Pitmen and other
Patrons of the Corporation Course. This
is Brutal Justice, but it answers as well as
Lynching in the Far West of the Great
Republic.
We are anticipating a very enjoyable
meeting, for Captain KRITERION, owing to
a stroke of Good Fortune which he received
by backing Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES'S quad-
ruped Herbal at Derby, has secured apart-
ments not unworthy of the Manager of the
Gaiety Theatre. The Hon. FLIFLATT and
others of Similar Kidney have promised to
join the Company, which I need not say
would be enhanced to the magnitude of an
Imperial Directorate by the presence of
Your Honoured Self and that of your Versa-
tile and Witty friend Sir FKAISER PUNNETT,
whose address you withhold in a manner
suggestive of Doubts with regard to my
Probity. Allow me, Sir, to state that my
Mug may not be great, but I never inter-
fere with any one else's. Captain KRITE-
RION is very honourable on these points of
Professional Etiquette, and so, I trust, am

and receives five shillings a time for his

"SAUCE HOLLANDAISE."
SIR,—Should the Devoted Dutchmen be
in want of a national melody wherein to
voice their loyal attachment to their youth-
ful and most charming Queen, they might
do worse than adopt and adapt the music
and words of Robin's song in what was
once, chez vnus, a most popular operetta,
c'ext-a-dire, The Waterman, of which the
refrain is—
"So, WILHELMINA, I love but thee!'
This is a suggestion made to me by man
ami le Prince Paul, who is still a contri-
butor to "La Gazette de Hollands, oui!"
and whereunto I set my seal and hand as,
if you will allow me the Anglo-French
carambole, "LA GRANDE DUTCHESSE."
Note.—By the way, to the modern ma-
jority who "did never hear of the jolly
young waterman," Mr. Punch, with thanks
to LA GRANDE DUTCHESSE, recommends the
revival of this old-fashioned operetta. Mr.
SIMS REEVES is still wjth us to instruct
any aspiring tenor as to how "Tom Tug"
should be played and sung.

FLODDEN FIELD.
(Extract from the Travel DUITH of Tobv. M.P.)
Ford Castle, Northumberland, Monday.
— Suppose that after lapse of nearly five
centuries all battlefields wear a placid air.
Something especially pacific about (he Field
of Flodden looked down upon this sunlit
September day. Hard to realise that upon
another September day, in the year 1513,
something like one hundred thousand men
(including MARMION) faced each otlrer on
this hill.
Their marshalled line* stretebe east and west,
And fronted north and south.
Walking hither from Ford Castle, tae
only sign of carnage we met with were
seven dead hawks nailed to a tree. The
Member for SARK, whose experience is
rather urban than rural, thought they were
grouse; willing to assume that this is one
of the habits or hospitable country. Kind-
hearted sportsman fills his bag; finds it
overflowing; bethinks him of the weary
pilgrim less blessed with opportunity.
Nails his surplusage within hand-reach on
the branch of a tree, so that he who walks
may take.
SARK sorely tempted to pouch a brace.
Thought the Chairman of his Election Com-
mittee would be pleased by receipt, per
parcel-post, of such reminder of the
thoughtfulness of the sitting Member.
When I reflect on pleasing picture of the
Chairman of Election Committee sitting
down to the Member's "grouse," lifting
the cover from a brace of roast hawks,
almost regret I dissuaded SARK from carry-
ing out his intention. Perhaps it was
better. Honesty is, after all, the best
policy. Besides, we can't spare SARK from
Westminster, and the Chairman of his
Committee is, I believe, supremely in-
fluential in the constituency.
King JAMES coming over the border with
intent to ravage the country of his good
cousin, HENRY of England (at the time,
burning and pillaging the territory of kin
good cousin, the King of FRANCE), put up
at Ford Castle. When he pushed on to the
fight at Flodden, he repaid hospitality by
burning the fortress. That a hard job with
walls of the thickness of this old Castle.
Still standing four square, fronting Flod-
den, is the tower roofing the room in
which King JAMIE slept on the night before
the battle.
Over the stone fireplace, on which are
carved the royal arms of Scotland, runs
this inscription: "King JAMES YE 4rn of
Scotland did lye here at Ford Castle,
A.D. 1513." Only last night, as it were,
he undressed and went to bed here,
dreaming of victory in the morning, and of
being crowned at Westminster—only a
last night dead these three hundred and
eighty-five years.
Probably there is nothing now, save
the bare walls, that witnessed that last
vigil. Certainly the mirror on the
table, ancient as it is, does not helong to
the early years of the sixteenth century.
Nor does the tapestry on the walls, faded
though it be; nor the heavy black oak
tables and chests. The bed is, neverthe-
less, called King JAMES'S bed. A prim-
looking four-poster, with long, lean arms
reaching to the ceiling, an embroidered
crimson coverlet, with some last touches
given to the pattern by centuries of moths.
Beside the fireplace is a staircase leading to
the room below. This is called the Secret
Staircase, and nineteenth century scandal,
echoing earlier tradition, trips up and down
the stone steps, lightly telling how the
room below was Lady HERON'S bed-cham-
ber, and how the King might have won the
fight at Flodden and changed the history
of Great Britain if he had not dallied at
Ford Castle long enough for SURREY to
pull his men together. In truth, there is
nothing secret about the staircase, which
in King JAMES'S time was probably the
only means of access to the topmost cham-
ber where the Kinc; did " lye."
There is a Gothic window in the King's
room, facing due West. Castles of King
JAMES'S day did not have windows as big as
this. Through a narrow slit of the same
wall, or from the roof, the King, on the
early morning of the battle day could
clearly see on the rounded hill a mile and
a half awav the earthworks that marked
the Scottish Cflmp. But he could not see
on the other side of Branxton Ridge, the
Enqjiih army, with SURREY in the saddle,
and CONSTABLE. HOWARD, STANLEY, and
D/TRE, marshalling their men.
He saw enough of them before night fell,
and when again morn broke,
The carcass of the King himself
Barn naked left as it wa« born.
The Earl could not know it so well,
8ear"hinp the tamp upon th» morn.
Un'il Lord DAC»KS at the last.
By certain signs did him b°wr«v.
The corps then in a curt beine cast,

So sings a nameless minstrel, whose
rugged verse the white-robed Chatelaine of
the Castle came upon in the libmry, and
brings to m«*. It tells in three "fyts" all
about Flodden. A note by a later, hut
long ago shrivelled hand, extols the shrewd-
ness of the singer in thus dividing his
story. A groat a "fyt" was the price
c'lrrenfc in dnys preceding our own ALFRED.
Having excited interest in his story by
recital of his first "fyt," the ALTIFI
AUSTIN of the sixteenth century wouldn't
tune up a^ain under a second groat, cl"im-
ing a third payment for the final "fvt."
As SART says, "Looking out on Flodden

ceiling the doomed STUART passed his lest

CONVERSATIONS FOR CASH.
[“ In Paris the diner-out can converse without trouble. From an ingenicus
gentleman, who does a large business in this line, ho can purchase a printed
slip, on which current topics are conveniently summarised, together with
appropriate anecdoccs.”'- Daily Paper.]
MESSRS. BONMOT AND RACONTEUR, the well-known conversa-
tion-mongers, beg to intimate that they have recently opened
a London branch of their business, and that they are prepared to
supply talk of all kinds at the lowest possible cash prices. They
venture respectfully to call your attention to the subjoined ex-
tracts from their catalogue, referring to conversations of the
kind for which there is a special demand at this time of year.
1. The Agricultural Blend. This is a most useful variety,
and is strongly recommended to London gentlemen, Americans,
and others renting country residences, as with the assistance of
a supply of this blend, they will be able to talk intelligently
about cows, pigs, manures, the price of hay, &c. It need hardly
be pointed out how severely handicapped are many who wish
to figure as country gentlemen by their ignorance of these mat-
ters. The following testimonial, from Mr. JEREMIAH DIBBS, of
Mincing Lane, speaks for itself: “Having taken Diddledum
Castle," he writes, “ for two months, I was much vexed to find
how unsociable the county Society appeared to be. For some
weeks they simply ignored our presence in their midst. But,
meeting by chance the Lord-Lieutenant of the county, I quickly
let off three pages of your Agricultural Blend, with the result
that his wife called on us next day.”
2. The Sporting.--This is a brand of conversation for which
there is a great demand just now. Messrs. BONMOT AND
RACONTEUR would warn purchasers to avoid most carefully all
spurious imitations, the use of which has often proved most
disastrous. They guarantee that their own Sporting conversa-
|tions may be used in any quantities, and with absolute confi.
dence, as they are carefully distilled from the latest and most
trustworthy text-books only. For the convenience of customers,

SCENE—A wild and desolate Htath. In the middle of the Staae a Caul-
dron is boiling. The Three Sisters sit round it. It is midnight.
First Sister. When shall we three meet again?
.Second Sister. We cannot tell when we shall meet again.
Third Sister (severely). You should not ask foolish questions.
Second Sister. Has MACBETH been here to-night?
Third Sister. He has not been here to-night. He will not
come any more. DUNCAN is in his grave. He will not come any
more. [They stir the cauldron.
First Sister. Why is DUNCAN in his grave?
Second Sister. MACBETH murdered DUNCAN. He murdered
DUNCAN because DUNCAN was king. MACBETH wished to be king.
First Sister. And is MACBETH king?
Third Sister (acidly). MACBETH is certainly king. MACBETH
murdered DUNCAN. He also murdered BANQUO. Your questions
are foolish.
First Sister. But why did MACBETH wish to be king P
Third Sister. His wife persuaded him. She wished to be a
queen and wear a Grown.
first Sister. It was certainly his wife who persuaded him.
Second Sister. It was in this way. DUNCAN was staying at
MACBETH'S castle. It was a dark night. Not a star was shining.
.First Sister. I begin to be afraid.
Second Sister. Two men were guarding DUNCAN'S chamber.
When they were made drunk, MACBETH took their knives. He
killed DUNCAN with their knives. He killed DUNCAN while he was
asleep. The men were asleep, too. They were quite drunk and
asleep. The night was very dark.
First Sister. Ah-h-h-h! [Shudders.
Second Sister. MACBETH put the knives back in their hands.
The knives were stained with blood. There was a great deal of
blood on the knives.
First Sister. And were the knives found in their hands?
Third Sister (crossly). Of course the knives were found in their
hands. Your questions are exceedingly foolish.
[They stir the cauldron.
Second Sister. When the knives were found in their hands they
were astonished. They were quite astonished. They said
nothing.
Third Sister (grimly). There was no time to say anything.
First Sister. The night was so dark.
Second Sister. MACBETH killed them before they could say any-
thing. And now MACBETH is king. He will not be king long.
MALCOLM will kill him. MALCOLM is BANQUO'S son. MACBETH
killed BANQUO.
First .Sister. When will MACBETH be killed?
Third Sister. When Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane.
First Sister (timidly). But urill Birnam Wood come to Dun-
sinane?
Third Sister. Of course Birnam Wood will come to Dunsinane.
Your questions are absurdly foolish. [They stir the cauldron.
First Sister. But when will Birnam Wood come?

A BACHELOR UNCLE'S DIARY,
ii.
Wednesday (continued).—Fight in car-
riage over. A drawn battle, in conse-
quence of my presenting MAX with a six-
pence for himself, and so putting him on
an equal financial footing with his brother.
Alight at Shrimpton Station. Met by
hotel 'bus. Get luggage and boys and
terrier on to and into it. Only other
inside occupants crusty-looking old gentle-
man and pretty daughter. Daughter
seems to take rather an interest in me;
glances shyly *p at ma now and then.
May be mistaken, but really think she
—well, likes the look of me, and
"Yow, yow, yow, yow I" yelps that horrid
dog. MAX has accidentally trodden on
his tail. So upsetting 1 TOMMY, with
both hands in trouser-pockets, swings
his lega about till he catches crusty old
gentleman nasty kick on knee. Old gentle-
man rubs knee and looks ten thousand
devils at me. Why me? Apologize. Old
gentleman still rubs knee ruefully, and
mutters "horrid boy," whereupon TOMMY
guffaws loudly and dog lets go a howl
which causes daughter to stop her ears in
anguish. Apologize again. Arrive hotel.
Manager looks askance at dog. "Sorry,
Sir, we don't allow dogs in the hotel, Sir."
Instruct MAX to remove brute to stables.
"OhI but mayn't he just sleep on my
bed?" Am firm, and dog sent to stable
forthwith. Conducted to our rooms.
Dress for table d'hote 7.30. Too early, this.
Can never eat satisfactorily until 8 P.M.
Boys evidently can. Appalling appetites.
MAX drinks four bottles ginger beer, and
then observes in perfectly audible tones,
that he feels as if he couldn't bear any-
thing on but his boots. Divinity, who is
seated next me, blushes and looks hard at
table-cloth. Frown at MAX, who only
says, "What 's the matter with you, Uncle
CHARLEY? Got a pain .in your "But
I dash in hastily with "Look at that ship.
MAX. What a beauty, isn't itP" "OhI
not a bad old barge," he replies, indiffer-
ently, but thank goodness, the situation is
saved. Asked by waiter if he will take
second helping of roast beef, MAX appeals
to me, in loud tones, to know if I shall
"have to pay anything extra" if he gays
"yes," because Ma told him he was not
to cause any needless expense, and as he
felt pretty full now, he supposed But
I cut him short (feeling hot all over), and
bid him not talk so much, but have another
helping at once. Begins again, "But you
know, I don't really "Frown severely.
MAX again sympathetic but perverse:
"Uncle, I'm sure you've got a pain
in "Cough loudly, and say I think
there 's going to be a shower of rain. This
time, Divinity laughs outright, and I feel
as though I could welcome an earthquake.
Dinner over at length. Dessert arrives.
TOMMY eats as much as lie can, and then
pockets all the mixed biscuits, bunch of
grapes and two pears. Dare not frown
again, too perilous. Cigar on balcony of
sitting-room. MAX starts to fetch Nipper
from stables. I insist that he shall be
brought in on string. Coming up stairs,
dog and boy meet old lady, who trips over
string, and sits down with fearful violence
on landing. Rush out in terror, and assist
her to her feet. Strong hysterics, smelling-
salts, brandy. Apologize profusely. Get-
ting quite used to apologies now, seem to
come naturally. Old lady vituperative.
Says I (again, why IP) should be ashamed

"DRAT THI BOY! WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THAT STRING TIED ON THAT FOWL'S LEO
FOK 1" "'TAIN'T OUR FOWL, MUVVER!"
of myself, and that I ought not to let a
string, with a dog at one end and a fool at
the other, go rushing about hotel stairs.
Am strongly inclined to weep, feel so de-
pressed. Conduct her to her own room,
dump her into chair, and escape. These
d dear boys will be the death of me.
Why did they bring the wretched dog at
all? Insist upon its being removed to
stables at once.
TO THE KAISER.
[On receiving the newi of the victory of Omdur-
man, the German Emperor called upon hia soldiei s
to give three cheers for the QUEEN.]
FOB years we had no reason, Sire, to doubt
The Friendship that we held sincere and

You gave a blow, and we received the clout,
All unexpected in our Southern sphere,
Where you and yours had no assault to
make.
We felt the blow. Did you feel your
mistake?
But now with generous feeling that we
prize,
You haste to show that British worth
you can appraise,
From Omdurman make Waterloo arise,
And gild the leaves of Britain's newborn
bays.
Thanks, grandson of oar well-beloved
QUIEN, the end
Of petty strife is passed—you are again our
Friend!

THE BATHING QUESTION.
MABTEB TOMMY IB EMPHATICALLY or THE OPINION THAT THE SEXES OUGHT WOT
TO BATHE TOGETHER.
LE MONDE
L'ON S'AFFICHE.
V. — MARRIAGE A LA MODE.
BEFORE the glorious Ascent of Man,
When wild as hares the noble savage ran,
Though Marriage even at that early date
Was held to be an excellent estate,
They mostly did without religious unction
And waived the more important social
function.
A person took the object of his heart
And in the jungle had hia joys apart,
And if their absence caused a certain doubt
Their families explained that they were out,
Engaged to lunch upon a local black,
And would in course of time be coming back.
Men deemed the statement contrary to
fact
But still received it with primeval tact;
Made no allusion to the "nappy pair,"
But went to business with a pensive air,
Either afield in search of bestial food
Or scalping niggers in the neighbourhood.
And thus without parade or even rice
Folk wedded in that Earthly Paradise;
Thus in a decent silence passed the Event
Before the age of bold advertisement.
But we, thank Heaven, are civilised
to-day,
And manage matters in a worthier way.
Betimes the keynote of the coming Boom
(Struck tentatively at the Drawing-Room)
While yet the victim looks extremely young
Sounds bravely from the stout maternal
lung.
Betimes in brazen tones her name is hurled
Forth by the frank Bellettrist of the
W-rld:—
"At Mrs. 'DICK'S '—the smartest dance in
town—
The most divinely fascinating gown,
A dream of muslin, girdled with a zone,
Virgin in aspect, eau de Nil in tone,
Was worn by Miss LB SMITHERS, just pre-
sented;
(Sir RALPH, her cousin twice removed, has
rented
Lord TOBERMORY'B charming Staflfa-
shooting,
Birds being rather poor this year at
Tooting);
Her mother—younger every year—who
brought her
Is constantly mistaken for her daughter;
The latter—this is private information—
Is sure to prove the season's chief sensa-
tion;
Add to her other charms un dernier mat,—
On dit that she should have a pretty dot."
Anon, the fowler having set her gin,
The pigeon being drawn adroitly in,
The solemn day of sacrifice is fixed
On which the couple's fortunes must be
mixed;
And, lest the public should be unaware
What noble enterprise is in the air,—
Also, by way of handing round the hat
To those whose purse is good for something
fat,
Up to the Social Press the news is sent,
And charged as extra se.c advertisement.
Being more costly than the common kind,
Because the simple reader takes it blind.
Then fall the wedding cards like winter
snow,
Free passes—in appearance—to the Show;
But really meaning : —Come or stay away;
You take your choice: in any case you pay.
For though you should (according to your
lights)
Object on principle to Marriage-rites,
You 're bound to give, if only under stress
Of menaced revelations in the Press.
For when we read, beneath the blazing sun,
The list of noble deeds that men have done,
When every goodly gift is bruited wide—
The diamonds bhowered upon the blushing
bride,
The husband's share—a brace of sporting
rifles,
A jewelled razor-strop, with other trifles
Common, as grammars say, to either sex,
From grand pianos down to open cheques—
Then too is read, beneath the blazing sun,
By implication, what is left undone.
Fitted by facial knowledge of the Great,
Happy the woman-journalist whom fate
Gives with her paper's pittance and her fare
A seat at Holy Hymen's, Eaton Square;
There to assist, a goodish way behind,
At this the triumph of her sex and kind;
Straining her eyes to catch—a thing that's
vital—
The semblance of a Person with a title;
Sketching my lady's corsage,—taking notes
Of plumes and bodices and petticoats,
In language of professional technique
All gaily redolent of Gallic chic!
But happier that reporter who achieves,
There where the Mother, later on, receives,
To find the wedding-spoils within her reach,
And touch the giver's label tied to each!
To tell us in what travelling array
The lady ultimately "went away ";
And whether Dover was the destination,
Or Someone's Castle lent for this occasion.

That guides and governs "Marriage a 7a

Enough is hinted here to show that we
Do not regard it as a Mystery;
For when a gentleman proceeds to wed
[A fairly private matter, you'd have said),
Swearing to keep the same continuous wife
For good, or even better, all his life,
[n point of fact, it '» not a private Show,
But just a public function, like the Row;
A paying job like rural selling-plates,
Or one of Aston Villa's little gates;
Refined as when your coster has his fling,

On which our stern morality is based;

HET NIETJWS VAN DEN DAG.
Amsterdam, Dondcrdaa, Sept. 8.
MIJNHEER DE REDACTEUR!—We leven ali
in een droom deze dagen, though there's
not much chance to dream at nights. The
whole town has gone mad with excess ot
loyalty, which reaches a stentorian climax
about 2 A.M. Quite old ladies execute
waltzes and fandangoes round barrel-organs
on the cobble-stone pavements; and as for
the younger generation, they have had a
week's uninterrupted marching up and
down the Kalverstraat and the Leidsche'
straat to the strains pi ii-che-fortissimo of
the "Wilhelmus" and " Bummle', bummle',
bumble' ist sn srhiin." Yet I have seen no
rowdyism nor 'Arryism, no pea-shooting
and very little back-scratching. Miscella-
neous amenities are being chiefly inter-
changed by means of hundreds of thou-
sands of long peacocks' feathers, with
which mijnhecr tickles mfiuffrouw under
the nose, or rife versa. Needless to say,
orange is the only wear, and very effective
it is, too. I have even gone so far as to
buy an orange tie myself, but shall pro-
bably get taken up for sporting such flam-
boyant attire at home.
Well, there is some reason for all the
enthusiasm. What else could be expected
when you have a radiant young Queen ol
eighteen, sympathetic, proud of her people
as they are of her, the great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-great - grand • niece
of the national Hero, WILLIAM THE SILENT?
(Note to linotyper.—Please get these
greats right; I have taken a lot o(
trouble over the Royal pedigree.) I have
seen her I don't know how many times
these last few days, looking each time
more charming than before, if that were
possible.
Throughout, the white-costumed "Little
Queen," WILHELMINA, played her part
right royally. It was an astonishing per-
formance for a girl of eighteen.
Yesterday night, fireworks, or rather
waterworks, on the Y, the best part of the
sight being the reflections in the water

[" A German Professor stronglv advocate! a mo-

OH! wonderful enlightened age,
That climbs each day another stage
In science and its laws,
Whose erudite professors wrest
Fresh secrets out of Nature's breast,
And trace effect and cause.
New rays of light, new gases sought,
By many a learned argonaut
Their eager brains expand;
No mysteries their minds perplex,
The very "incidence of sex"
Their science can command.
And, now the century grows old,
One than the rest more keen, more bold,
With skill that knows no fault,
That problem patiently has solved
Long while in mystery involved,
The use of table salt.
Hail, Herr Professor! not in vain
The cup of knowledge thus you drain
Down to its very dregs!
On, then! to further triumphs reach,
Until your grandmother you teach
The art of sucking eggs.

DARBY JONES ON THE LEGER.
HONOURED SIB,—If you or any other of
my Patrons failed to save over the Greer-
Darling Combination on four legs known
as Wtidfoicler, you could not have read
with attention the Ample Augury supplied
by your very Obedient and Humble Domes-
tic. I warned every one of Great Danger in
that Astute Quarter, though I confess that
I did not expect to see the Irishman
revenge the Battle of the Boyne by simply
strolling home from the Winner of the
Derby. I believe, Sir, that the Right
Honourable Cardinal RICHELIEU deceased,
but still kept alive by the Entertaining
Efforts of Mr. STANLEY WEYMAN, once
enjoyed what was known in Gallic History
as the "Day of Dupes." Similarly may
many Frequenters of the Turf look back
upon the Anniversary of the Sellinger
Stakes as the "Day of Mugs"—the mugs
having been shattered and broken like the
contents of the proverbial China Shop
when invaded by a bull.
After Wildfowler's victory, no doubt
tons of Condolences and otlier things were
poured upon Mr. LARNACH, Mr. MAHSH,
and, above all, on the Noble Owner of
Dieudonne, the Favourite's Stable Com-
panion. In my humble opinion, the Duke's
animal would have appropriated the stakes
had he been accommodated with a Start,
but of course Mr. MARSH knows better
than a Swivel-eyed Observer at the Street
Corner. It is given to most mortals to be
as wise as King SOLOMON after the shekels
have been lost and won. To one curious
fact I will draw your attention, and that is,
that for Seventeen Years at least one of
the three placed horses has been, owned by
a Proprietor of Titled Degree. You will
have to go back to 1881 to find three Tin-
handled Owners taking front rank at Don-
caster, and that was in the " Yankee Year,"

with the Aristocracy, and Mr. BELMONT

his triumphant march at the head of a ragged army through Italy.
Venice was still under the rule of the Doge, happily the last of
the historic race. Tottering to its fall, tyranny, made frantic,
clutched at the throats of the people. Every other man, ana
most other women, were spies, either in the pay of the Council of
Ten or of the Austrians. By the patriotic party, NAPOLEON was
hailed as a deliverer. How Lelio Zarano worked for a free Italy,
and how he was helped (and hindered) by the beautiful Viola is,
my Baronite says, well worth searching out beneath The Shadow
of the Three. THE BABON DE B.-W.
An Ice Name!
THE Rev. Mr. BAILEY writes to the Daily Mail from a " Water-
less District," called "Cold Norton, near Maldon." But what a
delightful name for any place, just now, when the thermometer
in the shade has been ninety-two and ninety-three, is "Cold
Norton." Yet "Cold Norton" without any cold water is not so
pleasant to contemplate. To be "obliged to s«nd three miles"
in order to " obtain even a small supply of water fit for domestic
use" is indeed an uncommonly hard case. Those who ought to
supply the needful cold water will get into hat water! and
then Oh, something iced, please.
"Is LIFE WORTH LIVING?" was at one time a much quoted
question, to which the most popular answer was, that "it de-
pended on the liver." Nowadays, a poorly-paid and hard-worked
clergyman replies that " it depends on 'the living.'"

THE NEAR FUTURE.
[" It is the Chemist who must come to the rescue of the threatened communities. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be
turned into plenty."—Speech at the JBritish Association's Meeting.]
THE NEXT TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT.
(By our own Prophet.)
THB year 1950 witnessed the triumph, in England, of Teetotal-
ism. Local Option, and Bands of Hope. Sir WILFRID LAWSON and
Lady HENRY SOMERSET had done their work. The liquor traffic
was extinct. Everybody drank tea and mineral waters.
The public-houses which had sprung up all over the length and
breadth of England had to put up their shutters, and, except in
the large towns, such a thing aa an inn was unknown. With the
disappearance of beer-drinking, it no longer payed any one to be
a "Licensed Victualler." This was somewhat inconvenient for
travellers, who sometimes had to travel twenty miles before they
could obtain refreshment. The difficulty, however, was gradually
met by the growth of tea-shops, which before long began to be
found in every village. Meantime, of course, all the breweries
were ruined, though, curiously enough, the brewers seemed none
the worse. The explanation of this was that, foreseeing the turn
of events, those gentlemen had, one and all, turned their con-
cerns into limited liability companies, and now lived luxurious
lives on the proceeds. The investing public—as usual—lost their
money, and there was acute distress in many a humble home.
One of the first persons to feel the inconveniences of the dis-
appearance of the taste for alcohol was the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. That functionary found himself face to face with a
vanishing revenue, while expenditure showed no tendency to
decrease. At last a brilliant Under-Secretary suggested, as a
last resort, an excise on the sale of tea for consumption on the
premises. Under his scheme, all tea-shops were to be licensed,
and the beverage itself, together with coffee, cocoa, and all
mineral waters, Ac., should contribute handsomely to the ex-
chequer. "For," said this brilliant young mam, who afterwards
rose to be Prime Minister, "People must drink something."
With some opposition on the part of the Old Temperance Party,
the Budget was carried, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
breathed again.
A generation passed, and A. B. C. shops, duly licensed to sell
tea and soda-water, covered the land. Licenses were freely
granted, and the revenue expanded. Meantime, a progressive
deterioration in the physical condition of the working; classes be-
gan to be apparent. They grew enfeebled and anaemic, and doc-
tors used to shake their heads and talk about "Neurasthenia."
Murmurs began to be heard about the unhealthy habit of tea-
drinking, and the scandal of tea-drunkenness. Institutions were
started for the treatment of tea-ism, and a gold cure was spoken
of. Societies even were founded by philanthropic ladies and
gentlemen, which carried on an active propaganda for the sup-
pression of the sale of tea and mineral waters. It was shown
conclusively by the medical profession that a diet of tea and bread
and butter was even less wholesome than the old-fashioned bread
and cheese and beer for the working man, while the habit of
taking "nips" of soda-water at all hours of the day, and drinking
it to excess on Saturday nights, was proved to be highly dele-
terious. More than one case of suicide was traced to this cause,
and the prevalence of depression and melancholia was attributed
to the "lowering" character of lemon squash.
TOL. CXV,
Then began a new temperance movement, which its detractors
styled beer-totalism. This crusade was instituted to combat the
growing habit of intemperance in the use of non-alcoholic
beverages, and to urge the moderate use of what had once, in
happier times, been the national drink—beer. The movement was
of course assailed with ridicule, but it grew, nevertheless. Meet'
ings were held in all the towns of England, Bands of Hope were
started, and in time the more extreme party aspired to suppresj
the sale of non-alcoholic liquids altogether. Total abstinence
from tea was preached, and thousands signed the pledge.
"The trade "—the tea-trade—grew alarmed. Their interest*
were threatened. They decided to resist the reformers by everj
means in their power. Parliament was petitioned, and after 8
Royal commission had sat, and the ill effects of tea-ism had beer
proved, it was decided to encourage the sale of beer by everj
means, and to remove the excessive duties which had hitherto
strangled it.
This was the state of things when our prophet last looked intc
the future.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN A Crowned Queen (BLACKWOOD), Mr. SYDNEY GRIER suffers
from inevitable comparison. His book should have come oul
before Rupert of Hentzau flashed upon the scene. The idea anc
general treatment of the two books are singularly similar. The
resemblance is carried to the extent that, like Rupert of Hentzau
A Crowned Queen is a sequel to an earlier writ story. In botl
romances an errant Englishman comes to the throne of a Conti
nental Kingdom. In both, at the end of the first book, he retirei
from his high estate, returning to his English home. Mr
ANTHONY HOPE, in his sequel, brings his hero in person back tc
the scene of his earlier triumphs. Mr. GRIER uses up a youngei
brother, who apparently (for my Baronite has not read An Un
crowned King) filled a subordinate part in the First Act. Mr
GBIER'S novel is cleverly constructed, and he moves with as
suranoe in the company of emperors, kings, queens, and greal
diplomatists. A misfortune about the story is that he has choser
for his hero a heartless, selfish cad. More fatal still is his tire
some style of narration. Count Mortimer, the cad aforesaid, it
conducting the strategic flight of the Crowned Queen. The car
riage breaks down, and this follows:
"i suppose it is out of the question to hope to find a wheelwright any wher
about?" said CYRIL, " but we ought to be able to get hold nf a blackamith o
carpenter who could patch this up sufficiently for us to reath the town, AS!
the driver whether there is any village about here, CARLO."
Paschicks interrogated the driver and returned to Cyril.
"He says that th^-re is no village nearer than the town, 8ir. But there i
a large farmhouse about half-a-nule away across the fields. We could reacl
it by a cart track which turns off from the road about a dozen yards farthe
in, and they would be able to give us accommodation for the night, beside
helping to mend the carriage."
This recalls the style of conversation in OLLENDORF. "Have
you the umbrella that my brother has?" "No, but I have th«
black ribbon (ruban noir) that your mother used to have."

A BACHELOR UNCLE'S DIARY,

Wednetday (contd.).—"Well, Uncle, if
you hadn't told me to bring him in on a
string, he wouldn't have upset the old gal,"
says MAX. Object to expression " old gal."
Mention this to MAX, who puts his hands
in hia trouser-pockets, and murmurs come-
thing about "blooming rot." So rude!
Induce boys to sit on balcony whilst 1
finish cigar. They sat pocketed grapes,
and throw skins at passers-by, despite my
remonstrances. Try to look as if I did not
see what they were doing. Sit in mo-
mentary expectation of visit from outraged
foot-passenger. At last summon up cour-
age to absolutely forbid this sport. "Well,
then, what are we to do?" says TOMMY,
despairingly. Feel remorseful now, and
as if I had done them some injury, so
suggest cards. "RotI" from MAI, and
"No fear I" from TOMMY. What do people
do to amuse boys, I wonder P
In sheer desperation, suggest taking
them to Music Hall, only place of enter-
tainment here. Howls of ecstatic joy at
the idea. So glad to have hit on some-
thing at last. Secure three front seats,
though as MAX and TOMMY sit upon one
between them, might have saved money
by taking only two. Gentleman in im-
possible check suit and yachting cap—why
yachting cap ? — calling himself "Jolly
JOE," on stage. Sings song, and imitates
person in state of inebriation. Very ele-
vating, this! Is succeeded by lady of un-
certain age; dressed as school-girl, and
carrying skipping-rope. She lyrically in-
forms us, in raucous tones, that she is
"a little lidy, a pretty little lidy!" and
then proceeds to other parts of decidedly
risque song. Getting uneasy, and wish we
had not come. Next "turn" high trapeze.
Boys enchanted; rather nervous myself.
TOMMY says, with bated breath, "Oh!
Uncle CHARLEY, do you think he'll come
a buster?" Reply, r'Oh! no, my boy, I
hope not. No doubt the man is a very
practised acrobat." TOMMY sighs and looks
rather disappointed, whilst MAX, with
ingenuous brutality of boyhood, observes
that he is "blowed" if he wouldn't like
to see him come down a "jolly good
wallop" into the netting. Dislike expres-
sion jolly good wallop." but seems no use
saying anything. Performing dogs. In-
telligent pig. Then, at re-appearance of
"Jolly JOE (in shiny dress suit and a lot
of shirt-front), fled, dragging boys with me.
On return to hotel; both say they are
"peckish." Am worried into eating some
lobster-salad with them, and finally retire
to bed with certainty of dyspeptic attack
on the morrow.
Thursday.-—See nothing of the two boys
until breakfast in table d'hote room. Glad
of this: feeling somewhat upset. Fancy
that mixture of boys and overnight lobster
salad bad for nerves. Begin breakfast 8.3C
precisely. About 9 o'clock, nephews burst
into room like whirlwind. MAX'S hair full
of sand. TOMMY'S trouser-legs dripping
with sea-water. Head waiter looks (de-
spairingly) first at them, then (reproach-
fully) at me. Why at me ?" We 've had a
ripping time, Uncle CHARLEY; caught
some crabs, and TOMMY fell in, and I got
a sand-eel, and oh! it iras jolly. And I
got a lot of sea-weed; it's awfully fine
but a bit smelly." Silence them at this
point, as every one stops eating to glare
in our direction.

Boys sit down and eat enormous break-
fast. Then MAX throws himself back in
his chair, and says loudly to TOMMY, "Look
here, STINKER" (this being MAX'S elegant
nickname for his brother), "you 've had
three eggs already, so drop that one, and
shut up." So embarrassing. Then turn-
ing to me, he says, "I say, uncle, don't
they give you a jolly fine blow-out here!
Awfully glad there ain't any extra charge
for anything, ain't you?" Dislike expres-
sion ""blow-out," especially when spoken
loudly, and in presence of feminine Di-
vinity sitting four seats lower down table.
Hurry them out. They rush away to

Mr. A. "So THAT'S TUB GIRL HE'S ENGAGED TO! I THOUGHT THESE BLONDE MEN ALWAYS CHOSE BRUNETTES?'
MlSS B. "AH, SHE WAS ORIGINALLY A BRUNETTE!"
TO MIDDELKERKE.
THE smooth paving on the promenade along the digue at Ostend
is excellent. It could not be better. When the temperature in
the sun last month was two hundred degrees, or more, this
paving was not affected, unlike the hornd asphalte, used in
similar English towns, which is half melted on a mild day in
December. And bicyclists are allowed to ride on the digue, west-
ward to Middelkerke. So we ride there.
Somehow, I am rather disappointed with Middelkerke. One
cannot judge of the effect of it as a whole. The greater part of
it is being built, and a good deal of the remainder seems to have
been pulled down. The roads will no doubt be excellent in time,
but at present they do not exist at all. There used to be one
along the sea-front, but this was washed away by a storm. The
Middelkerkers thereupon resolved to build a new sea-wall, about
three-quarters of a mile in length. Although five or six men
work at this for several hours a day, it does not advance very
rapidly. Meanwhile, the promenade consists of mounds,
trenches, heaps, holes, and excavations. The other thorough-
fares, if they existed, would he in much the same condition in
consequence of the building operations. Bexhill, in Sussex, or
any other new little town, would look much the same after an
earthquake.
The best amusement at Ostend is bathing. Most of the bathers
are English or Germans; the men in charge of the machines are
Flemings, who speak more or less French. Polyglot disputes are
frequent. One very hot morning, when there is a larger crowd
than ever, VANDEHBLANK and I wade into the water, as usual,
in search of a machine. At last, after wading about for some
time in vain, we perceive a double cabine, on the steps of which
there are no towels to indicate that it ia engaged, after the present
occupants have left it. So VANDERBLANK hastens up, and seats
himself on the steps in indisputable possession. To him arrive
three English girls, well-dressed, but noisy and vulgar, like many
of the English visitors. "Hi!" says one, angrily, "that's
our machine." Evidently they speak no French. I leave them to
settle the difficulty with VANDEHBLANK, who speaks no English.
"Je ne comprends pas, Mademoiselle^" he answers, politely.
"You come off 1" they all cry, more angrily. "Je n'en sais rien,"
says he. "Notre machine, comprenny?" they explain. "Com-
ment," says he, "cette cabine est a vousf Mais il n'y avait Tien
sur le marchepied." "Dunno what you 're jawing about," they
say, "it's our machine. Notre, comprenny?" "Pas du tout,
says he. "We 've been waitin' here an hour," they cry. Which
is, to say the least, improbable. VANDEHBLANK sits unmoved
and silent. "The people inside say it's ours," they scream.
Which is, to say the least, an invention. VANDEHBLANK answers
not a word. Then the young women lose their tempers alto-
gether, and scream in turn, "YahI You take advantage of us
Vos we can't speak French. You call yourself a gentleman?
You 're a low cad." And so on. While VANDERBLANK merely
says, calmly, at intervals, "Faiw pouvez dire tout ce que vous
voulez, je n'en comprends pas un mot." At last, finding that
abuse moves him no more than it would move the lighthouse,
the young women walk away through the water and leave him
in peace. ROBINSON THE ROVER.
A Little Stepmother.
Uncle. Hullo! Dor. got a new doll?
Little Miss Dot. Hush, Uncle, don't speak too loud. She is
not one of my own, but belonged to MILLIE SIMPSON, who was
cruel to her and 'bandoned her, so I have 'dopted her, hut I don't
want her to know because I mean to make no difference between
her and my own dollies.

DABBY JONES ON YARMOUTH AND
BLOATERS.
HONOTTRED SIR,— Groaning beneath a
Sun, which I should say would easily ripen
Bananas. Prickly Pears, Lum Quats, Pine-
apples, Mangoes, or other Exotic Fruita,
in the space of a couple of hours, I sit
down to address you from a chair uphol-
stered perhaps with the Mane and Tail
of a swarthy Derby Winner, but a seat
which I imagine must have been used as
an Instrument of Torture in those Ages,
when Dentists could not gain a Livelihood
by reason of the Bold Barons who scoured
the country extracting the Molars of those
Financiers who declined to contribute to
their Financial Wants. I mentioned this
Historic Fact to Captain KKITEHION, with
whom I share the Cottage Ornay by the
Sad and Sultry Waves of the Ocean, and
he bitterly regretted that these Happy
Times were now No More.
"Imagine, DARBY" (I permit the Fami-
liarity not usually granted to others of
his Kidney), "you and I mounted on a
couple of Thoroughbreds, going: out into
the Fair Land of Norfolk, discovering
where the Choicest Usurer resided, and
holding our forechips to his mouth, ex-
claiming, 'Your money or your Teeth!'
A splendid idea, thoroughly appreciated
by the late lamented Sir WALTKB SCOTT,
Baronet 1"
"A truce, KRITTT," I cried, "to your
Pursyflage (spelling dubious). Now that
we are in this town, so celebrated for the
Piscine Riches of the Sea, I vote we put
on our hats and collect some of the Far-
famed Bloaters of Commerce, and des-
patch them to our Patrons and Friends.
They will not be ungrateful!"
The Motion was no sooner put before
the House than it was, like the grant
which will be made to that Gallant War-
rior Sir HERBERT KITCHENER, Sirdar, &c.,
Ac., carried nem. con., or "without con-
sidering consequences." Personally, hon-
oured Sir, I have no great affection for the
Bloater. I prefer the Low-lying Sole, the
Obstreperous Salmon, and the Rubicund
Mullet, not to mention the Green-Eyed
Lobster and the Captious Crab. But there
are those of my Acquaintance, who revel
in the flavour of Yarmouth Sea-game, and
having a few Silver Pieces of the Realm
—the outcome of toil in your service—in
my pocket, I resolved to supply them with
a Fish Breakfast, Dinner, or Supper at
"Nix " to themselves and a Moderate Cost
to me. We chanced across nn exceedingly
Fair-spoken Monger in this Department of
Ocean Industry, who assured us that his
Fish-relishes had been patronised by all
the Crowned Heads of Europe, Asia and
Africa, as also the Presidents of the United
States, France, and the Republic of An-
dorre. a country of which I honestly con-
fess I was till then Geographically igno-
rant. He expressed his Sincere Regard for
the Turf and was glad to know that we
were Patrons of the Same, and he pro-
mised on payment (not taking anybody on
the "nod ") to send per passenger train
our parcels of the Delicacies of the Deep
to the named addresses. I am bound to
say that he fulfilled his contract, judeine
by the letters and telegrams of which I
have since been the Unhappy Rocipient.
One is from a Lady (who shall be incog-
niia) :—
"Have you lost all your sonars a« well as your

IF I LET THE OTHER WIN, THE CROWD 'LL JUST ABOUT HUKDER ME!"
A second, from a Sporting Friend, runs:
"We have plenty of foxes in our country, thank
you."
A third (on a Post-Card) was cruelly
worded: —
"Temr beastly bloater* have killed my wife's
favourite cat. Norfolk i» famous for partridgss.
Send us a couple of brace to destroy the odour of
your filthy joke."
In a fourth (a telegram) I read: —
"Railway Company only delivered parcel under
protest. Why try and poison our innocent chil-
dren?"
And so on, and so on.
Such, honoured Sir, is the unhappy result
of trying to introduce one's Friends to
Usually Prized Specialities. Of course I
immediately confronted the Dealer in
these Deleterious Delectations. All un-
abashed by my Righteous Anger, he im-
pudently declared that the Bloater Season
had not commenced. Whether he was
speaking the Ever-precious Truth I know
not, but he resolutely declined to make
good the loss of Money and Position which
I had sustained by his Callous Grasping at
an Illicit Trade. There should be a time
when Bloaters, like Oysters, are legally out
of Season. I write thus fully, because, nil
unwittingly, I made You and vour hon-
oured Comrade Sir FRAISER PUNNETT,
victims of this gross deception. I trust
that you will both charitably forgive the
Unsavoury End of a Well-meant Souvenir.*
I confess that I felt so Radically upset after
getting the above Abusive and Undeserved
Correspondence, that I was rash enough
to place more Ready Money than I could
well afford on Chon Kina for the (Irnat
Yarmouth Welter Handicap. I can only
be rescued from Durance Vile and the

prompt attention of your ever docile

QUITE THE CHEESE; OB, SNAPSHOTS AT EDAM.
In the North Sea, Sept. 10, 1898.
DEAR MB. EDITOR,—May I develop in printer's ink a few in-
itantaneous and fleeting impressions cinematographed this morn-
ing on a very delightful excursion to cheese-land provided us by
the Foreign Press Reception Committee P As far as I can sort
bhem, they are, roughly, as follows:
No. 1. Kwadijk Station, North Holland. Train deposits a
hundred and forty confreres and consceurs, decorated with the
silver star and black-anil-red ribbon (Amsterdam colours), and
duly free-passed. Outside station, sixty " tent-waggons "—a won-
lerful sort of shandry-dan with black leather hood, something
ike a four-wheeled Cape-cart, waiting for us. We mount by twos
ind threes, and procession starts along brick-paved road for
Edam, three miles off. Vanguard of the string of vehicles so far
ahead that they look like a line of performing fleas, filing past
geometrical dikes and avenues.
No. 2. Draw up at famous cheese-works belonging partly to
Dutch Minister in England, Baron van GOLDSTEIN OLDBNALLER.
We contribute our mite, and inspect dairy. Should like to be
>ne of the eighty cows here, and have nice stall fitted up with
Delft ware, looking-glass, oil-cloth, and carpet of sea-shells, and
je tended by dames with diamond head-dresses, and young ladies
11 gilt helmets. Stalls quite remind one of row of studios.
When good cows die, they must surely come to Edam, with its
coat-of-arms of three stars and a cow.
No. 3. Procession starts again, joined now by three carved native
gigs (this does not imply cannibalism, only the florid and antique
design sometimes seen in merry-go-rounds). Soon we cast out
>ur shoe ever Edam, and state entry begins. Much talk in Hol-
and about " States General," but what are they compared with
the Fourth Estate? We have been "inaugurated" in Amsterdam
and "entered" into the Hague, but our really triumphal arrival
is at Edam. Our JAN points out the oldest, the longest, the
squarest, and the richest inhabitants respectively. We—persons
ably representing various leading periodicals—find out the
prettiest for ourselves (and the ugliest for each other).
No. 4. The market square, gay with Coronation bunting.
Hundreds of shining cheeses piled like cannon-balls. Cheese-
fanciers busy bargaining. Two resounding smacks on the hand
signifies " Done." One slap, I think, means " Cheese it!" After
much tapping and boring, the yellow heaps are carried off by
pirates in white canvas suits, weighed and bought by the 150 kilo.
Too much for one lunch, so we pass on to Cattle Show. Fine
beasts, Deemster breed, four legs each, rosettes on tail, give
25 litres of milk per day or per annum (I forget which—not good
at live stock).
No. 5. Lunch at Town Hall. Grand reception by hospitable
Mayor, Mr. CALKOEN, in Court dress. Parade of naval cadets
playing " Wilhelmus" in square. Sit opposite Mayor, and try
to persuade him he is really Scotch—COLQOHOTTN. He won't have
it. Everybody clamours for his autograph, which he obligingly
gives, to the great detriment of his lunch. Speeches by persons
ably representing various leading periodicals, and M. JULKS
CLAKETIE. Finish with slices of cheese eaten like cake.
No. 6. Rest of party off in trek-schmten (primitive canal-boats)
to Volendam and Marken. Am left lamenting on towing-path,
with train to catch. Very sorry to leave Cheese-dom. Motto in
future shall be Edam ut vivam. Yours Dutchly, Z. IJ. X.

HOW SOME PEOPLE INVADE THE SOUDAN.
ON THE WHOLE MR. PVXCH PREFERS THE LESS PERFIDIOUS METHODS OF GENERAL KITCHENER.
WITH MARGARET AT MARGATE.
"OH, she's a Daisy! a perfect Daisy!" exclaimed an enthusi-
astic passenger on returning from his third voyage on board the
good ship La Marguerite, to Boulogne and back, having been
favoured with exceptionally beautiful weather, calm sea, cloud-
less sky, and the gentlest of .Knb;i ii-harpish winds that not in-
frequently play sweetly in the Channel. "Elle eat une, Mar-
guerite! Tine Marguerite parfaite!" the accomplished linguist
explained, buoyantly adding, so as to make his meaning per-
fectly clear to the meanest capacity, "As there is no night
travelling on board, La Marguerite, she being 'built that
way,' is intended only for a Day-sea!" Fortunately the cour-
teous captain overheard this conversation, and politely, but
firmly, bade the over-excited passenger farewell at Margate, the
good ship forthwith proceeding to her moorings in the Thames.
The best news has since been received of tne health of this
nautical Faust, whom it was not necessary to put under re-
straint, but whose end might have been tragic (seeing that La
Marguerite, having finished her voyages, will not be heard of
again for another year), but for the timely care and attention of
Mr. J. L. TOOLE, who thoroughly understands the treatment of
persons subject to fits of jocosity, and who, as every one will be
delighted to learn, is enjoying the sea-breezes on the salubrious
Kentish Koast. Up to now, tout va bitn.—(From our own

young author in the art of composing an-
other variety of magazine story, which
can be turned out with even less trouble
than the previous examples. It may be
defined as the Vague and Impressionist
Sketch, and it is much fancied by editors
just now. The only rules which the young

avoid any point in the title, to begin in
the middle of the story, and to end at the
beginning. Careful study of the example
appended will make these instructions
clear.

She drew her chair a little closer to the
table, and stretched out her hand towards
the sugar-tongs.
"And that is your only reason, HENRY P"
she asked.
He sighed deeply. "My only reason,
MARGARET? No, I dare not say that.
Supposing, for instance"
Ho broke off abruptly, and there was a
pause. Six lumps of sugar dropped into
the cup with a sullen splash.
"But surely," she said, with infinite
meaning in her voice, "if it happened
otherwise, it would be different, HENRY P
And then there are consolations. Yes,"
she repeated, dreamily, "there are always
consolations. Will you have some cake P"
HENRY started to his feet, stung to tie
quick by her words. "Pah!" he cried,
contemptuously, "what a vacuous soul is
yours I Do you ever feel the stress of life,
MARGARET? The keen bitter-sweet search
after the nebulous ideal? The swift, grim
ironic sense of struggle with an over-
powering and unintelligible destiny, that
tortures all humanity on one complex rack,
and obliges me to talk like this for pages
together?" And, seizing a large slice
of cake in each hand, he devoured them
greedily in alternate mouthfuls.
MARGARET rose, and moved to the win-
dow, gazing wearily at the watercart
passing underneath.
"Misery is the only happiness," she
murmured, "and only white things are
black."
"Two epigrams," HENRY mumbled, his
mouth full of cake. "Two brilliant epi-
grams, and I haven't made any yet.
MARGARET, the habitual liar is the only
truthful man!"
The girl nodded. "What insight!" she
said. "What keen perception of the uni-
versal muddle! Yes, HENRY, it is even aa
you say. But if you knew the ardent glow
of love that surges in my unquiet heart—
but, ah! it must not be," and turning
towards the fire-place, she lifted the poker
and stroked it tenderly.
"Certainly not," cried HENRY. "If I
proposed to you, you 'd have to accept me
or refuse me, and, in either case, some-
thing would happen. In our stories,
MARGARET, nothing ever happens."
"You are right," said the other, simply.
"You are quite right. Nothing ever hap-
pens—only sweet, soulful conversation like
this. But what," she added, with a sudden
sense of fear, "what will you do now,
HENRY? Oh, the grey dreariness of life!
What will you do now P"
HENRY pushed his cup towards her reso-
lutely, almost defiantly. "I will drink,"
he said, "another cup of tea."

IT is hard even for the practised novelist to live up to the first
chapter of Boden's Corner (SMITH, ELDER). For dramatic situa-
tion, intensity, and simplicity of narrative, it is marvellous.
Mr. SETON MERRIMAN does very well, more especially when he
comes across the sole witness of the death-bed scene, the Processor
von Holzen. The Professor is about as deeply dyed a villain as
is made in Germany, and my Baronite has no invidious meaning
when he says that Mr. MERRIMAN is thoroughly at home with
him. The plot is ingenious and new, unless, indeed, suggestion
of it be found buried in Blue Books reporting results of enquiries
by Board of Trade inspectors into the death-breeding trades ot
the potteries. The blackness of Von Nolan's doings is plea-
santly relieved by the sprightly ways of Mist Marguerite Wade,
and the delightfully stolid Major White, who, when wrong is
done, feels an irresistible inclination to "thump somebody.1'
The least successful character in the story is Mr. Boden, who
gives the book his name. But his Corner is excellent.
M. PATTL BOTIRGET must have become suddenly very much im-
pressed by a recent study of David Copperfifld, under its French
title of Le Neveu de ma Tante, to have selected for, as it were,
the part of "Chorus" in his La Duchesse Bkue, such a noodle
as is M. Vincent la Croix, the weak-kneed amateurish artist,
who so evidently stands in the relationship of the verdant
David towards his idol James Steer forth, who, with evil
character, and gifted, moreover, with literary and dramatic
talent, appears in this novel under the style and title of "Jacques
Mnlan, le ceKbre romancier et auteur dramatique." Moreover,
when Molan has selected Vincent as his confidant and amiable co-
consj)irator against the happiness of the unfortunate ingenue
Camille, the theatrical Little Em'ly of this story,
the author, as if suddenly struck by a qualm of lite-
rary conscience, makes the unblushing Molan suddenly say
to his friend Vincent, "J'ai envie de t'appler Daisy,
ma pdquerette, comme le jeune hamme naif du Neveu de ma
Tante. So Steerforth, meeting his worshipper Dai-id, in the
VOL. cxv.
Golden Cross Hotel in town, exclaims, "My dear young DAVY,
you are a very Daisy I" and subsequently he asks, "Will you
mind my calling you DAISY?" "Not at all," says David Copper-
field. And DAISY he was henceforth. It must be of very great
assistance to any author to start his work in this way. The
Baron only notes the above fact by way of suggestion to those
who, blessed, or otherwise, by Providence, with a talent for
romance-writing, do not quite see how to set about their work,
and not as a recommendation, or in commendation, of La Duchesse
lileue.

their amiable platitudes about "strange and unexpected events

the year. The Prophets, however, are provokingly silent about
many important points in the future which we would fain have
elucidated. For instance, Mr. Punch, and the public generally,
would like to know what answer the stars are giving to the
following questions:
When justice is going to be done in the miserable DRETFTJS
case, and how many more resignations and suicides are going to
be caused by a twopenny-halfpenny bordereau, or a forged petit

How many wars will result from the TSAR'S Peace manifesto.

bring the Boers to their senses.
Wlien Li HUNG CHANO is going to be finally deprived of his

What "graceful concession" the Government will make to
MARCHAND to induce him to evacuate Fashoda.

and enjoy Her MAJESTY'S hospitality.
When the muzzling order will be relaxed.
When the present Summer will end.

speeches to his grandfather, who surely does not want any
further advertisement.
WTien London will even distantly resemble Paris in having its
streets properly and uniformly built and illuminated.
When the British cabman will be satisfied with his exact fare.
When we shall cease to be reminded on every hoarding of the
triumphs of the pill-trade.
WTien the HOOLEYS and the HOOLIGANS will retire into private
life.
When—but the catalogue of questions is endless. If only the
Prophets would favour us with information on these points, we
should be really obliged to them. These gentlemen have yet time
to revise the future, as 1898 has still three more months to run.

No manual intended to assist the young
author could be considered complete, unless
it provided instruction in the art of writing
the sporting story. It is possible that
one or two trifling errors may be detected
in the following example, but nevertheless
it is the sort of thing which a magazine-
editor jumps at.
LOLLIPOP'S LEGER.
Vast excitement reigned in the paddock
at Sandown, where crowds of betting men
were eagerly laying odds of thirty to forty
against the field. The moment for the
decision of the great race was fast ap-
proaching, and, until an hour before, Lolli-
pop had been strong favourite-Lollipop,
CLARENCE PLANTAGENET's pet horse, who
so often carried his master in the Row, and
who had won the Derby at Ascot in such
gallant style, jumping every hurdle with
consummate ease. But quite suddenly
a wild rumour spread among the crowd
that Lollipop had broken down. Many
refused to believe it, especially those
who on the previous afternoon had seen
CLARENCE PLANTAGENET exercising the St.
Leger favourite round Belgrave Square.
Still the report gained strength, and
it was positively asserted by well-informed
persons that Lollipop had been unable to
touch his breakfast-consisting, as usual,
-
of carrots and sugar.

CUB HUNTING.
"HALLOA! WHAT 's THAT OLD HAIR TRUNK THB MASTER 's ON THIS MORNING?"
"ANOTHER BARGAIN. PICKED HIM UP HOME-WHERE DOWN SOUTH. SATS HE 's WONDERFUL AT WATER."
"H'M—SHOULDN'T WONDER. DREW A BATHING MACHINE, I EXPECT!"
EUEOPEAN DISARMAMENT.
(By 3tr. Punch's own Prophet.)
THE year 1950 is destined to go down to history as the yeai
of a great proposition. In that year the Tsar of All the Russias
put forward a suggestion for a general European disarmament.
The suggestion was received with respect by the press and the
public, with enthusiasm by the various "Peace" Societies, and
with scepticism by those in authority. Elderly men hinted that
the same proposition had been made before and from the same
quarter; statesmen shrugged their shoulders, and the Times sat
—adroitly enough—upon a fence in a leading article.
And yet the condition of Europe at this date made the Tsar's
proposals not untempting. For more than fifty years Germany,
France, Italy, and the rest had been groaning under the blessings
of peace. Military expenditure throughout Europe had grown
enormously, and the burden of compulsory service had propor-
tionately increased. It had been the beneficent province of
science to invent weapons of destruction, so exquisite in their
ingenuity, and so costly in manufacture that every nerve had to
be strained by the Great Powers to pay the bill. Rifle succeeded
rifle with bewildering rapidity, each more perfect and more ex-
pensive than the last, and each, of course, necessitating the
withdrawal of the former one. The fashion in quick-firing guns
altered even more quickly than those guns fired, and the new
patterns were seldom in use a couple of years before—such was
the "progress" of science—they were superseded. Every im-
provement in the guns required a new ammunition, and every
improvement in the ammunition required a new type of gun.
"Peace" seemed likely to produce universal national bankruptcy.
Taxation had increased by leaps and bounds in all the countries
of Europe, and the National Debt of France reached the "re-
cord" figure of two thousand millions amid general rejoicings
among all good Republicans. It really did seem as if, with all
this expenditure upon the army of what was still called "the
Republic," the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine was only a ques-
tion of time. It is true the taxpayer was heard at times to com-
plain that his burdens were getting beyond the limit of his
capacity to bear them, but the shooting of a few small shop-
keepers soon silenced these cavils, and every one agreed that
the hated Bourgeoisie could not be permitted to dictate the
policy of the country.
In Germany the pressure of militarism upon the population
had not grown lighter with years. As weapons grew more scien-
tific in their construction, and more delicate in their manipula-
tion, the term of compulsory service for every citizen had steadily
lengthened, until by now it had reached the truly magnificent
term of five years, a term, curiously enough, identical with that
of our English penal servitude. The five years of military train-
ing exacted from every citizen before he could begin the task of
earning his own living, heavily handicapped the youth of the
country in the struggle for existence, and caused a considerable
reduction of the tax-paying population through emigration.
Thus, with a rising expenditure and a sinking exchequer, the
German Emperor found himself face to face with insolvency.
Such was the state of things then when the Tsar of that day
promulgated his famous letter advocating total or partial dis-
armament, to the astonishment of the chancelleries of Europe.
No one could understand how so eminently sane and civilised
a proposal could have emanated from St. Petersburg, and think-
ing men noted it as remarkable that Western Europe had had to
wait for the suggestion of the ruler of a half barbarous empire,
before the idea of putting an end to a preposterous and
intolerable system occurred to its mind. The statesmen of
Europe, however, took a different view. They hinted at inte-
rested motives on the part of Russia (which was known to be
in the last stages of indigence), pointed out the chimerical nature
of the proposition, and the practical difficulties it involved,
acknowledged the inconveniences of the present state of affairs,
but deplored the impossibility of altering it.
And that was the state of things when our Prophet awoke out
of the trance in which this vision of 1950 had plunged him.

"WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS."
Tommy. "FATHER, WHAT MEANS IT 'TO HAVE INDIGESTION'?"
A VERY DIFFICULT PROFESSION.
IF Mr. Justice DARLING'S recent example of sentencing a
French prisoner in his own language becomes the rule, then a
German culprit will have to be sentenced in German, an Italian
in Italian, a Spaniard in Spanish, and so on. But why the
sentence only? Why not the entire trial, which is of even greater
importance, in the prisoner's own language? All candidates for
the Bar will have to pass a thoroughly practical viva vooe ex-
amination by examiners of various nationalities, and the legal text-
books will require translating into every known language. And
how about the jurymen? Will they have to "cram " for certain
trials in French, German, Italian, Spanish, or modern Greek, as
the case may be? If so, they will require time for the process,
and the prisoner will have to wait until judge, barristers and
jury are quite au fait at the language, whatever it may be.
Then the Bar will indeed be a "Learned Profession "! Or the
proceedings might be simplified by establishing various Courts,
as in an Exhibition, e.g., the French Court, the German Court,
and so forth. But perhaps after all, our own DARLING was only
just "airing his French" for practice. He may have either just
returned from Boulogne-sur-Mer, or, intending to spend a few
days at this favourite French bathing-place, his lordship may have

My voice, as Laureate, is lent
To mourn the nation's rude bereave-
ment;
But Canon RAWNSLEY too shall get
Full credit for his work upon it;
(I never knew a subject yet
On which he didn't do a sonnet).
As one who has the vested right,
I want to weigh our Whitby hero;
I own he wasn't erudite,
His knowledge as a fact was zero;
What then? He chose the better part;
He did not need, like us, to cumber
His open mind with rules of art
And other literary lumber.
Here from this headland so sublime
He watched the gulls, etc., go it;
He heard the waves that seldom rhyme
And yet distinctly touch a poet;
Speaking with Nature face to face
In pious terms, like Mr. KEBLE,
He melts us with his artless grace,
Despite the spelling, which is feeble.
Here still we have the moorland view
Where furrowing becks debouch in
ocean;
The sea-mews wail, the sea-whales mew,
The billows still retain their motion;
Yonder the same old eagles screech,
Nothing disturbs the ancient feeling,
Save where you sniff from Whitby beach
The fume of bloaters faintly stealing.
You'll note the cross which I propose
To offer our lamented brother;
One side presents an English rose,
An apple-tree relieves the other;
This, emblematically done,
Means Eden lost through lack of morals;
That stands for Paradise regained
By him and us who wear his laurels.
These facts, which you are free to share,
I owe to curious skill in botany,
Claiming a great advantage there

DABBY JONES ON NEWMARKET.
HONOURED SIR,—Once more we are back
at the Metropolis of Racing, where the
Jockey Club rules the Roost with all the
Cock-suredness possessed by the Herald of
the Morn. There is a very select air about
Newmarket, which baffles the pen of the
most consistent Descriptive Writer, as the
unfortunate Reporter is called to his face
by the Energetic Managing Editors of the
Leading Daily Papers. In so far as I have
been able to discover, all the Apprentices
in the several Racing Stables are treated
in a way which would cause Mirth and
Gladness in the High Class Seminaries
known as Eton, Harrow, Winchester, and
Rugby. These embryo ARCHERS, Cus-
TANCES and CANNONS have their Morals so
well looked after that no one could possibly
suspect them of Betting, Card-playing, or
Piteh-and-Toss proclivities. They sing in
choirs, and doubtless shudder when they
hear of a Jockey being deprived of his
Riding Certificate for exercising the Long
and Strong Pull of the Nefarious Horse-
man. It appears to me that the life of a
Neophyte at Newmarket is one continuous
exemplification of the Racing Pilgrim's
Progress. Evil creatures, known as Touts,
are constantly endeavouring to discover
important Stable Secrets; worse tempters,
in the shape of Unprincipled Trainers, in
other parts of the Kingdom, beset their
paths, and yet these lads go to bed with the
Chickens and arise with the Lark, who is
so silly as to inhabit a " watery nest." The
amiable Wives of the Newmarket Trainers,
to say nothing of their beauteous Daugh-
ters and Nieces, are never weary of pro-
viding for the Comfort and Refinement of
the Apprentices.
It may seem strange to you, honoured
Sir, that I should have cast my optics on
these Youngsters, but just as the Mo-
mentous Battle of Waterloo was won in
the Playing-Fields of Eton College, so are
nearly all the Derbys, St. Legers, and
Autumn Handicaps predestined in this
Town of comfortable cobs and succulent
East Country Meat; for be it known that
Newmarket is not only renowned in cer-
tain circles for horseflesh, but also for the
carcases of the more nourishing Bullock
and Sheep. My attention was specially
drawn to the Newmarket Apprentice by
Captain KRITERION, who pointed out to
me how greatly the Turf was benefited by
the Attention and Care bestowed on these
youngsters, who, by dint of steady appli-
cation to Business, might, by the time we
tiad changed Centuries, become the Idols
of the Public, possessing Varlets to hasten
bp their beck and call, displaying Jewelled
Pins in their costly scarves, and generally
mve developed into Personage* deserving
of having their Portraits limned in the
Illustrated Papers.
Nowadays the Aristocratic Parent is at
a loss to know how he can provide for his
J often too numerous) Progeny. He has so
far relaxed his Obsolete Prejudices as to
permit his son, or even daughter, to loll
about the Stage in a Comedy of Society, at
a Salary which would not be sneezed at by
an Under-Secretary of State; but he has
not, in eo far as I am aware, ever turned
lis attention to the wonderful Opportunities
For Fame and Fortune opened up by the
Jockeyian Profession. Had I a son, hon-
oured Sir, I would nourish him on Gin,
like a Yorkshire Terrier meant for Show
purposes, and place him in a Racing Stable
when he attained to Years of Indiscretion.
In the Gloaming of my Existence his Valet
would probably be varnishing my Patent
Leather Boots, while his Master would be
Hob and Nob with the Highest and
Wealthiest in the Land.
A Wretched Clerk in the Uncivil Service
of the QTTEEN may by the Sweat of his
brow, when his Head is a Skating-Rink for
Flies and his whiskers blanched as Al-
monds, command a paltry income of £.500
a year from the Taxpayers of Great Bri-
tain, but the Jockey of Nerve and Reso-
lution, at an ace when he would scarcely
be returned to Parliament b.v a Responsible
Constituency, is intrusted by the Best of
the Best, Millionaires and Senators with
the Safeguarding of Thousands of Sove-
reigns. If he be not Al in the saddle, he
can always gain about twice as much as
he is worth in France, Belgium, or Ger-
many. So when any one asks me, "What
shall I do with my boy?" I invariably
reply, "Apprentice him to a Training
Stable or a Ready Money Bookmaker. Of
the two choose the Trainer, for the Bookie
may go broke, the other never."
The Jockey Club Stakes oupht to be one
of the most popular contests of the Season,
and so it probably would be were it run
at any other Racing Jtendezvous than New-
market. But the Jockey Club doesn't en-
courage the British Public, and the B. P.
doesn't encourage the Jockey Club. I
honestly believe that the B. P. prefers the
City and Suburban, or the Chester Cup, to
this Big Back-end Fixture, and. indeed, if
the "Seizerwitch" and Cambridgeshire
were disputed at Kempton Park, they
would attract more Patronage than they
ever do alongside the Ditch. Those who
bet on these events, for the most part
breakfast at home on Training Reports,
and lunch at their Clubs on S. P. betting
over the Tape. However, having borrowed
a Pony (I mean a quadruped, not a five-
leeged bank-note) from my friend the
Honourable FLIFLATT of Oxford College.
I must send my Muse to the Post, and, as
a Prelmiinary canter, give the followino; to

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—In view of the ani-
mated discussion with regard to balloons
on the stage, may I point out that some
eighteen or nineteen years ago a little
extravaganza entitled TiaUoonacy held the
stage of the Royalty Theatre for some 150
nights? The chief incident was the escape
of the beset proprietor of a tea-garden,
with his wife and the Strong Man, in a
balloon, in which they were transported,
escaping from bailiffs, to "regions un-
known." I only record thie fact in order
to show that Great Dramatists often follow
even to the skies little burlesquewrights.

WISH TO COME NEAR I"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE first and abiding impression my Baronite gains from read-
ing John Splendid (BLACKWOOD), is. that Scotland enjoys ex-
ceedingly bad weather. Never did poor gentlemen go to
wars, Ettle or large, in worse weather than Mr. NEIL MUNRO'S
fancy devises for John Splendid and his comrades. It blew,
it rained, it hailed, it thundered, and whiles it snowed. In-
cidentally there are "town gibbets on which two corpses swung
in the wind, like net bows on a drying pole, going from side to
side making the woeful sough and clink of chains. This is not
promising of cheerfulness. But so long as these Scottish gentry
could get at each other's throats, with occasional bouts with the
Irishry, they seem to have been cheerfully indifferent to the
weather. Through the bristling, bustling picture of war and
rapine runs the silken thread of the old, old story, love. Elrig-
more, the young soldier of fortune, home from foreign fields to
find his fill of fighting at home, is speedily enchained by the
provost's daughter. Those about to marry will find a study of the
history of the two interesting, inasmuch as it includes an episode
of the first kiss between lovers, cunningly devised and daintily
told. The book abounds in graphic touches descriptive of storm,
whether of the elements or or man's devising.
A veritable edition de luxe is Fashion in Paris, showing
"the various phases of feminine taste"—likewise masculine,
to certain extent—" and resthetics, by OCTAVE UZANNE, trans-
lated from the French by Lady MARY LOYD, with one
hundred hand-coloured plates, and two hundred and fifty
text illustrations, by Francois Courboin," and published in Lon-
don by WILLIAM HEINEMANN, of whom it may be said, in the
language of CHARLES DICKENS, when expressing his opinion of
the capabilities &f the Todgers' establishment, "Oh! Todgers's
could do it when it chose! Mind that,"—and so can W. HEINE-
MANN. As a book of reference for the illustrator, for the author
and dramatist, for stage-manager and theatrical costumier, this
work is a most valuable authority on feminine costumes in
France during a century of restlessness, when every change in
political opinions seems to have also necessitated a rapid act of
change in dress. A few "Dandies" are shown, and most un-
comfortable they look whether in or out of uniform. There was
no attempt at " ease "; but the struggle was to be "elegant," and
very unsuccessful the struggle appears to have been. The
"little patriots," boys about twelve or fourteen years of age,
seem to have had the best of it as far as comfort goes. But the
poor Dandies, in blue or brown high-shouldered, high-collared
coats, frock or swallow-tailed, with baggy trousers, stnped white
and red, and tucked into high-low boots, reminding the Baron of
some old pictures of LISTON as Paul Pry, with any amount of linen
cravat twisted round their throats, must have had a very bad time
of it, if they were only a quarter as uncomfortable as their dress
makes them appear. The colouring of these pictures is excellent.
In 1836 the men were just a trifle more sensible, except in the
matter of straps, pantaloons, and the tightest possible boots.
The fashion for a lady endimanchee at the Tuileries in 1831 has,
in a modified form, reappeared at the present day, so also has that
of 1819 in the Gardens of the Tuileries, with the exception of the
bonnet as worn at that period. The fashion of 1852 at the Opera
is not so very far off that of 1898; and in 1868 the " gent a-blowin'
of his bacca " in a bright blue frock coat, white waistcoat, black
cravat, brownish-red check trousers, blue stockings, pumps, and
a tall hat, while enjoying himself at the "Cafe de la Rotonde,"
is a thing of beauty not to be matched by any Londoner or
Parisian of the present sober-coloured century. Only in the
miserable period of the Commune do the ladies dresses look as
sad and as sombre as their faces. The book finishes with Les
Bicydistes; but of these the artist has not given us outrageous
specimens. That the fashions of to-day show a great improve-
ment on those of a hundred years ago, and a stijl greater on those
of forty or fifty years since, is the decided opinion of
THE BARON DE B.-W.

"How should we bear our Trials ?”
DEAR MR. EDITOR,—Courage and a
studied cheerfulness of demeanour provide
the best cure for the troubles of daily life.
A true lady will never give way to bad
temper, but will be courteous to her in-
feriors, obedient and respectful to her
superiors, and amiable to her equals. Our
trials will be greatly mitigated if we cherish
such qualities as tidiness, cleanliness, and
punctuality, concerning which last-named
virtue it has been aptly said that "pro-
crastination is the thief of time." A re.
membrance of these golden truths will add
to the pleasure and the usefulness of our
lives.
Yours faithfully,
DOROTHEA MARY HIGGINS (aged 9).
P.S.—Miss WIGGINS my guvernes tells

DEAR MR. EDITOR,—Mother says that I
am to tell you how I should bear my trials,
but please I would rather tell you about
my canary. It is a yellow canary and it
lives in a cage and it sings. It can't sing
real songs with words but only tunes. It
is such a nice canary and mother says that
if I am good I may bring it to see you some
day, and I will let you give it a lump of
sugar, and then you will know what a nice
canary it is. My brother BOBBIE has a
kitten, and the kitten loves my canary ; it
will sit for hours watching it in the most
affectionate way. The kitten is black and
white, and has a curly tail, and I have
written all this myself except the spelling
and the stons, so please send me the prize.
Your affectionate friend,

DEAR MR. EDITOR,—You ask how we
should bear our trials. I, alas, have many

father. I try to be a help to him, and give
him good advice but I am afraid he has a
hard heart. Only yesterday I told him
how sad it was to see him smoking so much.

"I 'm a bit of a story-teller myself."—Ancient Lyre.
Hotel Sen Trovoto, Rue Rupert, Londres.
CHER M. ROBINSON DE CRUSEMONT,—As another of the Great
Misunderstood, I greet you with impressment. I have read your
excellent bordereau in the Fine and Large World Magazine; and |
also many letters throwing painful doubt on your veracity, and
demanding a revision. How it is true that fact has often a sotipfon
of I-know-not-what more strange than fiction. Is it not the
motto, this, of Sir NEUNES, himself, limited?
Oh yes! I have perused your adventures written in a style
the most flowing, and I have—how do you call it ?—chortled at
the versatility of him who, elevated to speak the language of my
adopted France, has, in those thirty years of savage life, but
perfected and polished his acquaintance with the tongue English.
Yes, I have read of your shipwrecks, of your prolonged residence
in the comparative seclusion of an insulated sand-bank, of your
one-oared contention with sharks, of your pearls and rum; and,
in fine, of the so delightful soirees which you name the corroborees.
A£i! man ami, to confirm your tale—forgive the little jeu
d'esprit—what would you not now give for one of these same
corrobo rees? Is it not that such a bird in the hand is worth two,
or more, in the Bush?
And then I recall me how the spirit-voice came to you under
the wamwam tree when you were very dry; and it said "Coupe
I'arbre "; and how, like holy Muise, your unveiled lady made the
good bucketful to issue from its trunk. 0 yes 1 there was Truth
at the bottom of that well. It leapt to the eyes. And to me
also, who speak to you, came just such a voice saying "Cut it 1
And I cut. Hence am I here, not less than you, in the great
city of refuge where they publish only the vraisemblable, and the
wild-duck never says himself.
Exhausted with the recollection of those scientific researches
recorded only on the carnal tablets of your interior, the claims of
the Britannic Association have, it may be, left you no leisure for
the study of the "Affair Threefoot," in which, without boastful-
ness, it is permitted to say that I have played a not unworthy
part. You, my friend, who know the misery to have your most
sacred allegations called in question, you at least will believe
me when I say, on my honour as a soldier, a gentleman and
a foreign Count, that I am a forger. It is a distinguished officer,
the Colonel du Pate d'Huitres, who would give me his moral
support in saying that the end justifies the means.
You have lived in domiciles inaccessibly removed from the
refinements of civilisation and diplomacy, and will admit that
even the aborigine, black as he is, has embraced this elementary
law. He desires, let us say, to lunch. Good. The end is natural
and even pressing. He possesses a mother-in-law, let us say,
who has the air of being succulent. He offers her a razor, secured
—who knows?—from the toilette-table of a deceased missionary
(for there is honour even among untutored thieves); but she
remains blind to his humane suggestion. Impelled therefore to
an unavoidable violence which jars against his better feelings,
himself he renders her inanimate. Briefly she becomes chops.
Now, judged by the moralist, his conduct is open to censure.
Yet, to the statesman, to the diplomat, the imperious demand
of his purpose, namely to lunch if possible on grilled woman,
justifies the apparent crudity of the means adopted to attain
that end. And how much more so, if she were an Israelite!
Conspuf.z Ifs Hebreux!
O yes I the end justifies the means; and, in turn, it is often the
means that justify the end. Nay the two are sometimes indis-
tinguishable, as with us, by example, you and me, man ami, who
have found each a confiding publisher to give us the means, that
is to say, the vulgar wherewith; which, always apart from the
love of Truth for Truth's sake, may hie considered to be our
end. But you. you have otherwise achieved une belle reclame
not surpassed by the great travellers and scientists who have,
some of them for the first time, made themselves remarked by
contradicting you, over their signatures, in the Press. I have
seen your stuffed figure in the Gallery of Heroes, Rue Marie-
la-bonne, though I like better the chevelure of M. McBETH at
the Lycee, which is of a redness and originality more than
imaginable.

a Germanic race in Western Europe, of which some traces are found in earlj

near the river Congo), or Betersbourgoi (from the city of that name which onci
stood in Northern Europe).
(*) What this "iron road " was is much disputed. Some have held that it it

Others are of opinion that it was really of iron, and was intended to reduce
friction in mechanical traction.

TO CHARWOMEN.
A MOVEMENT having been started, accord-
ing to the Westminster Gazette, to provide
Technical Training for charwomen, it has
been suggested that the new London Uni-
versity (when it comes into existence)
should hold an examination in this subject
and confer a degree of Char. Bac. The
papers would run on the following lines :-
(1.) Show how to test for alcohol in a
barrel of beer.
(2.) What is a “perk”? Mention any
article that is not a perk.
(3.) An eminent authority has laid down
the axiom, “Three drops of brandy on a
lump of sugar is a certain cure for the
spasms.” Express the value of “three
drops" in imperial pints and quarts.
(4.) (a) A is a charwoman, B a black
bottle, and x an unknown quantity. At
| 10 a.m. the formula A + (B + ) represents
a vertical line. At 1 p.m. the formula
A + (B - x) represents a horizontal line.
Deduce the value of x, and show that, in
| certain cases, C = ca.
(6) Assume that x = xx = x?. Now, 1
is the only value of x that satisfies this
equation : therefore, a = 1. Again, 1 is
the specific gravity of water: therefore,
2 = water. Examine the validity of this
argument.
(5.) What do you know of the properties
of the liquid known as “cold tea"? What
is the difference, if any, between its effects
and alcoholic poisoning?
(6.) A lady, whom you are obliging at
great personal inconvenience, asks you to
wash up the dishes before you go home.
How do you proceed under the circum-
Old Gentleman (who has received a present of Bulter from one of his Tenants). “And now

THE CHINESE TROUBLE.
Cdney Hatch, September 30.
DEAR MR. PUNCH.—In accordance with
your instructions, I have set myself to
elucidate the mysterious doings of those
in authority at Pekin, and to indite a clear
summary of the situation. After seventeen
hours of mental wrestling with the facts,
my friends removed me to the above ad-
dress for change of air. That change has
worked wonders in ine, and now I see
everything quite clearly. The situation,
putting it briefly, is this :—
For a long time past, WUN-LUNG, a
Reformer and Progressive member of the
S. Pekin and Tor-Kin County Council, has
been plotting to upset the Manchu dy-
nasty. This he seems to have accom-
plished, and set up a Womanchu dynasty
instead. KANO-WANO has made himself so
unpopular that Kix-KiM has finally ousted
him from office. Should FO-MBNT raise a
rebellion, SLI-WUN would fail in his plot
to set FAT-UN THE SECOND on the throne,
and thereby defeat the Empress Dowager.
In that event, it is quite clear that Rus-
sian influence, or Russian influenza—forget
for the moment which way you spell it:
head aches, rather—as represented by
General BOUNCIMORF, would triumph, and
the Cantonese would—oh! I don't Know—
do something else, I suppose, and
But why these straws in my luxuriant
locks? Why these attendants closing me
in on every side? Will return and finish
this article presently, but must really go
out and smash some windows first. I'm
all right, but head feels like a balloon.
Ha, ha! Ta-ta!

GEMS AT DftURY LANE.
MANY Happy "Returns" to Messrs.
RALEIGH and HAMILTON, authors of The
Great Ruby, and to Mr. ARTHUR COLLINS,
managing director of Drury Lane, where
this "new and original drama of modern
life" is now running its successful course.
The authors are excellent cooks, who know
the public taste. Mr. COLLINS woithily
upholds the great Dniriolanian tradition
of the Augustan-Harrisian Age, and ad-
mirably is he aided by Mr. GLOVER, who,
when flourishing his baton, as he sits in
the orchestral conductor's seat, is the evi-
dent "living picture" of "The Arms and
the Man,"—legs being invisible,—and by
the three clever scenic artists, Messrs.
PERKINS, CANEY, and BRUCE SMITH. Last,
but not by any means least among the
"talt nted assistants," comes the stage
manager, Mr. FRANK DAMER, for whom
there will be precious little rest, day or
niirht, during the nin of this piece and the
preparations for the pantomime.
The scenic effects successfully rival any-
thing hitherto attempted on the old Dniry
stage, "A Village Street" and "I/ord's
Cricket Ground" being respectively tri-
umphs of stage illusion. How we trembled
for the passengers crowded on to the coach
and four, "tooled" on to the stage from
"Right Fourth " entrance down almost to
the "flote," on prompt side! How we
didn't envy any one of theml And really,
when one comes to think of it, this is the
most sensational moment in the entire
drama! Will that coach-load come safely
across? Who is driving? However,
neither the indefatigable Mrs. JOHN WOOD,
the real heroine of the piece, nor
Mr. ROHERT PATEMAN, as the thorough-
paced villain, is among the passengers on
the Drury Lane-stage coach: they are too
old stagers for that. Truth to tell, Mrs.
JOHN WOOD is the piece; and next to her
comes Mr. ROBERT PATEMAN, with such
a curiously fascinating "Johnnie-Tooley"
look about him, that the strongest melo-
dramatic situations in which he appears
are robbed of more than half their signi-
ficance by the ever-recurring thought,
"Now, what would TOOLB have done in
this situation?"
Mr. J. B. GORDON, as Sir John Garnett,
and Mrs. WOOD as his gad-about, flighty,
good-hearted, sleep-walking wife, have a
capital little domestic drama all to them-
selves, and quit* apart from the piece, in
the second scene of the third act, which
would be> perfect in every detail if Mrs.
WOOP would be content to simply play
"Home, Sweet Home" on the piano, and
not attempt to sing it. The old familiar
melody, brought to an abrupt conclusion
by the player's emotion, would touch the
audience electrically; but the singing is
very dangerous.
Mrs. JOHN WOOD walks in her sleep, like
Lady Macbeth; she plays the part of an
elderly Lady Teazle to a very commonplace
.Sir Peter; she has moments of pathos and
of broad farce: she is so intimately and
essentially mixed up with the melo-dramati-
cally tragic interests of the piece, that it is
a wonder how the authors, having dared so
much, did not go just one step further, or
higher, and send her up in the balloon with
Johnnie-Toole-like PATEMAN hanging on by
his eye-lids to the car. from inside of which
Mrs. WOOD could safely bare exclaimed.
"Only room for one inside! Where wfiuld
I/on like mf to drop you,?" And then, as
she loosened his hold on the car and
chucked him over, she could have ex-
claimed in her grandest manner, "Down,
down to Hampstoad Heath, and say I sent
you thither!' Tableau! Up goes Mrs.
WOOD in the balloon. Up goes the cur-
tain several times, and Drury Lane vi-
bmes for minutes with enthusiasm.
The balloon business is not precisely a
novelty, either on the staee or in fiction,
but never can the situation have been
more effectively represented than in this
Raleighistic-Hamilton drama.
The seventy persons engaged in this
play, of which number twenty-six have
sneaking parts, do their lively level best.
Mra. RALETOH is capitally suited with n
character speaking broken English; and
Miss BELLA PATEMAN makes the most of an
elegant, htrd-un "Society mother."
As a kind of "Ranji-Sinji" cricketing
Indian Prince, with a lot of "local colour"
on his face, and much uninteresMnr stuff to
utter, but with plnptv to do, Mr. LORAINB
is very good; and Mr. LOWNE contributes
his best to the comedv portion of the
entertainment. The political opinions and
social allusions in the dialogue appear to go
for nothinp. and, indeed, are quite out of
pb'ce in a drama where all serious "talkee-
talkee," "with a purpose." on extraneous
matters, is rightly resented by the itidience.
By the way. the arrangement of the pro-
Gramme is irritating: the "characters in
the drama" are in small type on the right
hand side, where the names of the imper-
sonators ought to be, and the names of (he
actors nnd actresses in largo type on the
left. Perhaps Dniriolanns Imperator be-
Tan it, and the present management mav
be nervous about departing even so much
as by one hair's-breadth from the Drurio-
lanian tradition.
Anyway, as a "good wine needs no
buish," so "a eood melodrama needs no
push." Old Port-wine drinkers used to
sny. "Pass the nibv." Good: The Great
Tfu&v is Passed, stamped, and unanimously
approved! But where would' the ruby
have been had not Mr. ARTHUR COLLINS
secured that pearl of <?reat orice. that gem
of a comedienne, and set their Garnett in
WOOD?
IK to the benefit conferred (at last) upon
the public by the electric lighting of Hyde
Park there should be added a constable or
two, then "Londoners over the border"
(Bayswater or South Kensington border)
might, in comparative safety, use the Park
as a short cut. It is well to remember that
there is "safety in numbers."

stolidly); "you have humiliated me in the

you have thrown things at the passers-by:
you have turned your bedroom into a cross

("Only one," again from MAX, with exas-

DARBY JONES ON TURF TOPICS.
I CAN claim, I think, Honoured Sir, Con-
siderable Kudos (I don't know who Kudos
was, but believe him to be an Ancient
Realisation of the good genius of Lord
KITCHENER) for having picked two out of
the three Leading Champions in the Jockey
Club Stakes. With many others I had a
weakness for the claims of Dievdonnt, but
I did not forget either Cyllene or Velas-
quez. It is somewhat strange that Mr.
C. D. ROSE, who, if I am not misinformed,
in business turns his face to the West,
should in matters of Yachting and Horse-
racing exhibit his countenance (I speak
from the New World point of view) to the
(to him) more Encouraging East. And
yet that terrible Man from over the Her-
ring Pond, TOD SLOAN, is with us again,
making Bookmakers and Backers alike
tremble at his Science. Watching his
Lightning-like Progress, the Casual Spec-
tator is never certain whether he be pick-
ing a Stone out of his "Gee-gee's" Hind
tag or whispering Words of Encourage-
ment into his Ear. In my opinion, this
Transatlantic Equestrian is not only a Cen-
taur, but a Pounder (you will twig my
indifferent International Jest, gentle Sir),
for when beaten on Lord DUNRAVKN'S
KiTschwasser by SAM I.OATEN on Man-
doria, he nevertheless managed to upset
the verdict by an Objection. His magna-
nimity in riding for the Noble Owner of
the ill-fated yacht Valkyrie was only
equalled by the fact that his Objection was
held to be perfectly just by the Stewards.
SLOAN does not take any mean advantage,
in fact, he is SLOAN Square.
Whenever I hear the cry of "Sweep!'
I take off my Hend-covering, sometimes in
the form of the Gibus of uncertain method,
sometimes in that of the Mountain Ram-
bler, such as you, Sir, when wandering
through the Netherlands with an Alpen-
stock, affect with such becoming grace,
but I must record the Circumstance that
I raised my Glengarry high when I learnt
that the Jockey Club had carried fico
"sweeping" Resolutions, which, according
to those learned in Turf Lore, should
cleanse a few Augean Chimneys of Unne-
cessary Soot. The only thing is that it
lakes a Year or so of Sundays to compre-
iend perfectly the Exact Meaning of the
Allowing Precept :—
"At every meeting one-half of the total amount
of added money adverti«ed to be given shall be
apportioned to races of a mile or over for three
years or upwards only; and of this half, not letf
.ban a moiety shall be for races of a mile and a
lalf or upwards."
I opine, as one feeling in the dark, that
I know what this means, but does the
British Public? The Pronunciamenio of
the Turf Parliament seems on all fours
with the Edict of St. Stephen's Assembly
on the subject of Vaccination. The B. P.
is very foolish. It will ask, "Why is the
Advertised Money to be appropriated for
three years or upwards only?" (I am quot-
ing my revered D. T.). Why not for a
Century, or even until the Millennium?
Let me now turn from the Parliamentary
Ditch to the more open Mead of Kempton
Course. I venture to breathe the follow-
ing Monody on the Duke of York Contest:
I "ve no taste for the Harbour or Greek,
The B(tmb-and-Com doesn't please me;
While the Mixture will surely be weak
If the Troubadour'» going be free.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE current month's volume of the Biographical Edition of
THACKERAY'S works (SMITH, ELDER), being the sixth, is compact
of the novelist's contributions to Punch. "Much of my fathers
best work," Mrs. RITCHIE writes, in the always interesting in-
troduction, " will be associated with the name of the friendly and
supernatural being, Mr. Punch." THACKERAY'S first contribu-
tion, "Mrs. Tickletoby's Lectures on English History," was
avowedly not a success, a conclusion that does not surprise, in
consideration of its somewhat elaborate and heavy fun. It did
not prevent his being invited to join the staff of Punch, a step
accomplished at Christmas time, 1843. Mrs. RITCHIE writes, he
"took his seat at the Punch table as a successor to ALBERT
SMITH." That is a mistake. ALBERT SMITH never advanced
beyond the position of an outside contributor, and never dined
at the table. In the next year THACKERAY made a distinct
hit with "The Fat Contributor's Notes of Travel." Then came
the immortal Jeames writing from "Buckley Square." The
Book of Snobs, and a series of imitations of novels by eminent
hands followed in due course. By a letter written half a century
ago to Mrs. PROCTER, my Baronite observes that in these early
days Mr. Punch and his Young Men used to dine on a Monday*
"at five o'clock sharp." THACKERAY not only wrote but drew
for Punch, his sketches being estimated to reach close upon four
hundred. Through ten years he sat weekly at the Old Mahogany
Tree, where his initials, engraved in firm hand, are to this day
seen among the signatures of others who have gone, and some
who have com*.
Life is but ehort. I Let them sing on
When we are gone, ' Round the old Tree.
Meanwhile, it is pleasant and entertaining to have in the com-
pendious form of this volume contributions of one eminent
among the old hoys.
If you want to $50 to Cuba, you had better " take your DAVEY,"
which is not a brief form of legal oath, but is meant as a piece
of sound advice to those who are interested, as so many of us
• "' I doubt it,' «aid the Carpenter." By the way, although THACKERAY
ceased his regular weekly contributions to Punch, he retained his seat as one
of the Staff at " the Table," uud occasionally took part in the discussion on
topics of the day.—ED.
are just now, in The Story of Cuba. (CHAPMAN AND HALL), as it
is told by the descriptive writer whose surname is given above,
»nd whose Christian name is RICHARD. What delightful travel-
ling I Jungles and virgin forests, through which you must cut
a passage with a hatchet (does the artful explorer merely imply
that you must "axe your wayP"), or set fire to the impenetrable
tangle and issue forth in a blaze of triumph. Then when our
daring "Mos'r Davey Bo" ("for which overhaul David Copper-
field, and when found, make a note of"), hot and weary, was
longing for a bath in cool, pellucid lakes, he was informed by
his guide that to take such a plunge would be fatal, as the bed
(of the river, not the traveller's) was alive with snakes big enough
to take down Mr. DAVET, as a succulent morsel, at one n"'p- So,
as the sun declined. Mr. DAVEY followed this brilliant luminary's
example, and also declined—to bathe. His account of the secret
societies that brought about the rebellion is most interesting.
Astonishing, too, is the impotence of President CLEVELAND to
stop the filibusters who were doing such serious injury not only
to Spanish interests, but to all chance of peaceable government.
To all we recommend Mr. RICHARD DAVEY'H recently-published
work.
FRANK LOCKWOOD was happy in his life. After his death, he
has been fortunate in that Mr. A I-GUXTINE BIRRBLL undertook to
write a record of his too brief career. A Biographical Sketch
Mr. BIRRELL modestly, and in the main accurately, calls the
work which SMITH, ELDER publish. It is slightly built, but per-
fectly proportioned, based on intimate personal knowledge of
the subject, with keen appreciation of his ever bubbling, some-
times boyish, humour. Those who did not know FRANK LOCK-
WOOD in the flesh will here get bright glimpses of his character,
and will, at least in part, understand what a delight was his com-
panionship, how precious his friendship. Lord ROSEBERY con-
tributes to the book a simple yet glowing tribute to the memory
of a lost friend. Not the least charming, because the most
characteristic, touches in the book are the brief letters written
by LOCKWOOD to his young daughters, with sketches illustrating
passages in the quaintly-fabled lives of the wicked Moses and the
guileless Aunt Maria.
Mrs. BRODRICK'S Ananias (M KTII ITK.N & Co.) is in no way related
to the " stock of BAHABBAB." in which Miss MARIE CORELLI some
time ago invested. Which of the two liars in this story the
authoress intends for Ananias, the Baron is at a loss to deter-
mine. The essential plot of the tale is neither particularly
pleasant nor startlingly new, "yet 'twill serve" any novel-de-
vourer whose taste is as yet unjaded. The loveless man and plain
woman agreeing to marry only for mutual pecuniary advantage
under a will, and the man subsequently falling in love with a
talented and pretty girl, are not materials so entirely fresh aa
they might have been. The finish is probable, but too common-
place for any reader in search of a sensation. The style of the
writer pleasantly imposes on the reader "old lamps for new,"
and it is not until he has gone too far not to advance to the end
that the experienced peruser, being aggrieved, says to himself,

To find an amusing story, a story that, by its whimsicality,
really makes you laugh, is so rare, nowadays, that the Baron is
delighted at having the chance of recommending such an one to
his friends in The Dulce and the Damsel, written by RICHARD
MARSH, and published by C. ARTHUR PEARSON, Ltd. Any one
reading this book on the Baron's recommendation, will agree
with him in wishing that the wicked, vulgar old mother had been
ultimately shown to be in no way related to the two charming
girls, of whom one is the heroine of the story. It may be, on
the whole, a trifle too exaggerated, and the conversations unduly
spun out: but here comes in the fine art of the practised novel-
reader who knows how to skip, and the judicious skipper will
be rewarded. THE BARON DK B.-W.

DARBY JONES ON RACING CONTRASTS
AND THE CESAREWITCH.
HONOURED SIR,
From Leicester to Kempton is quite a
Shock to the Racing System. I should
imagine that no greater Contrast could
exist than that between the Battlefields
of Leicester and Kempton, unless it
be that separating Waterloo from Om-
durman. In the Midlands it is all
Business without much Pleasure; in the
South it is Pleasure with Business tacked
on like an Extra Laoe Flounce to a
Duchess's Court Gown. Kempton is the
most enjoyable of meetings, because, as
my patron the Hon. FLIFLATT (about to
leave Oxford College) observed on Friday,
after securing a handsome Souvenir,
thanks to the prescience of a Fortune-
teller, who shall be as Incognito as the Heir
Apparent when he travels abroad, "At
Kempton," he said, "there 'B no beastly
crushing. It's like racing in your own
back garden." And so it is. Note the
Programme: "Going—Cab to Waterloo;
Train to Kempton; Under Cover to Stand.
Returning—Under Cover from Stand;
Train to Waterloo; Cab Home." What
could be more perfect P
Far different is the state of things at
Newmarket. Monsieur Louis DB ROUGE-
MONT might pitch his tent in a secluded
corner of the "blasted Heath" for several
weeks without being disturbed; but when
the rush did come, he would probably be
ridden over and pulverized by the tread of
Cobs, Ponies, and other small Equine
Deer; for whereas at Kempton Locomo-
tion by Rail is the Great Incentive to
I'ticing, at Newmarket it is perambulation
on Four-legs which makes Everybody move.

Excited Scotchman (who has just hooked a fish). "I 'M DASHED FEARED I 'LL LOOSE MY

GULLIVER THE SECOND.
PERSONALLY, I have never doubted the
fact of my existence. Many persons are
sceptical because I cannot quote exact
time and place of my birth, but I would
remind these that it is not unusual to
forgot the precise circumstances of one's
arrival in the world. Passionately fond ot
adventure, I was a mere boy when I sailed
in the schooner of (no good
filling in the blanks, because people only
turn up registers and pretend that such
ships don't exist), in. search of Treasure
Island. Having found this (I am no
scientist, and cannot fix lat. and long.),
we took on board a cargo of Bank of
England notes, rejecting the gold on
account of its weight and bulk, and set
out homeward bound. Had we been con-
tent with less, we should have secured
more, for we had so laden the schooner
with notes, that at the very first breeze
we met she shipped a sea and sank like
a stone. All hands perished except myself.
I luckily caught hold of a frightened dol-
phin, and although a little upset at the
loss of our treasure, determined to continue
my course for London, where I knew I
should have no difficulty in starting a
syndicate to recover it.
At first my progress was slow, and
slightly jerky, but having caught a passing
shark, I dismissed the dolphin, and har-
nessed my new acquisition to a spar—Dum
spiro tparo!—guiding it by means of a bit
which providentially I happened to have
in my pocket. This greatly increased my
speed, and now I made, as I reckoned,
twenty-five to thirty knots an hour. I
sighted a white line which I took to be the
cliffs of Dover. I soon discovered my
mistake, for on going up to what I fancied
was the Customs House, in place of the
customary savage official, I was greeted
by a courtly cannibal, who expressed in
the most gentlemanly manner his desire to
kill and eat me. But no one need come to
harm if he knows how to make a certain
sign which is understood by savages the
wide world over. Placing my right thumb
to the point of my nose, I extended the
fingers straight out towards the cannibal.
The effect was instantaneous.
A a soon as he had mastered his feelings,
he hurried me off to be introduced to his
relatives, who, on learning that I had
made the sign of their tribe^ the Guttar-
bhoys, greeted me with effusive affection.
They asked a thousand questions in their
guttural tongue, for which I had ready
answers. The Guttarbhoys listened with
wonder and awed delight. (Savages _are
so much more reasonable than civilised
men; they do not expect you to prove the
truth of every word you utter, nor do they
set able Editors upon you to try and catch
you tripping.) I was their hero, and they
could not do enough for me. The Elders
of the tribe brought such of their wives as
they most honoured, and insisted on my
accepting the female crowd as a present.
Now the wives they most honour are those
who will never see fifty again. There were
more than a hundred of them. If I did
not accept, it would have been considered
an insult, and I should have been roasted
whole. So I accepted, escaped roasting,
and in the dark night, I fled, swimming
in the direction of Greenwich.* * * Safe!!

above most interesting article, wishes it to be dis-

ECHOES FROM PARIS.
THE same (more or leas) trusted correspondent who wrote in
our columns last week upon the Chinese situation—dating his
communication from Colney Hatch—has sent us the following.
We endeavoured to read it in the ordinary manner, first; then
sideways, and finally, upside down. AH, however, in vain, and
we submit it (with great misgivings) to the public, in the fervent
hope that what appears dark to us, may—or may not—seem sense
to them. He writes thus: —
"From diligent enquiries made on the spot, it seems that in
regard to the present great mysteries of Paris (no connection
with EUGENE SUE), M. DRUMONT, after calling for a petit bleu
and a small soda, commenced his attack on DREYFUS in the Libre
Parole. The attack was hazy—almost EBTERHAZY—but still,
clear enough to denote that the Jews were the objects aimed at.
Being re-jews—beg pardon, reduced to this expedient, the Minis-
ter of War consulted with the Bordereau (don't quite know what
a Bordereau is, but should fancy it is a sort of law officer of the
Republic), and came to the conclusion that a revision was in-
evitable. Public opinion, in the name of France, demanded it—
"ask for it and see you get it," as the posters say—Colonel Pate
de Foies-Gras will now be tried by the Court of Cassation for
complicity in— • Oh, very well, then, I'll come quietly, if it's
exercise time in the back-yard. Sorry, dear Editor, to break off
so abruptly, but these big, rough attendants worry one so, and
they will not be denied. Only yesterday I heard one of them
saying to another that "He" (meaning me) "is not likely to be
violent, but is certainly a bit balmy about the crumpet." Now,
Sir, I ask you, what did those mystic words mean?

ARTHUR lifts his baton. Strike up! Elijah is about to begin.
The first violinist looks up beseechingly. Sir ARTHUR pauses,
baton raised. "But," whispers to him the violinist in a tremolo
voice. Sir ARTHUR cuts him short. "There is no BUTT," says
he, sternly, and whack goes the stick. Then, subsequently,
Miss CLARA BUTT wrote to the Daily Telegraph, and explained
how it was that, though always perfectly in tune, on this occa-
sion only she, quite unconsciously, did not keep time.
THE CITY OF ROME.—In the Times report of the doings of the
Court of Common Council, we read:—"Replying to Mr. ROME,
who asked what steps were to be taken to abate the smoke
nuisance in the City, Mr. Deputy WHITE said," &c. Well, it
doesn't matter what Deputy WHITE said; that's not the point.
But how comes it that there can be any discussion after Ro
has spoken? "Roma locuta: causa finita": Mr. ROME ha
spoken, and there :s an end. In future, let us hope that ROME
will simply deliver himself oracularly, and so act up to his ancient
and glorious name.

SOME most interesting information by Mr. WALTER ROTH-
SCHILD, well known as a skilled naturalist and collector of rarest
specimens, written in a delightfully natural style, is given in
the Nineteenth Century for this month. He entitles it, "Rough
Notes on the Birds of the Bass Rock and Neighbouring Shores."
The notes, however, are not at all rough on the birds, for he
handles his feathered friends as IZAAK WALTON recommends his
pupils to handle the gentles, "as tho' he loved them "; and he
does. The name of "Bass Rock " sounds most refreshing. From
its position, it would of course be a Draughty Bass Rock, not
Bottled. What a chance for the sea birds! Here the Solan
Goose plays his Bass solo; and a wise or Solon Goose he is, mak-
ing the Bass Rock his Philosopher's Stone. Here the Gannets lay
a solitary egg: sporting birds they are, evidently, laying one to
two on The Rock. But, a propos of "The Rock," perhaps at
some future time Mr. WALTER ROTHSCHILD will tell us something
about that Gigantic Roc that flew away with Sinbad the Sailor
and kindly dropped him en route. A delightful place of resort is
this Bass Rock I Here there are pretty little Ducks—bless 'em
—and, of course, plenty of geese. In the evening, without any
dancing or spirit license, they enjoy the music of the Sand-piper
and the dainty entertainment provided (very occasionally) by the
Humming-bird, while the red-throated Diver, coming up as
fresh as a Lark, sings, "How happy could I be with eider!"
Verily 'tis a Birds' Paradise.
ADVICE.—M. UNLIMITED LOU-IB DE ROUGEMONT, after reading
his Daily Chronicle of Friday, October 7, will apply to himself the
somewhat cold comfort suggested by his own name, i.e., " ' Grin'
and bear it." He could bring out his lectures under the title
of " Grin's Goblins, und other Fairy Tales."

Cycle Millionaire (acquiring accomplishments). "Hi! STOP HIM! STOP HIM!
THAT CONFOUNDED LEFT PEDAL AGAIN!"
I 'VE LOST
PUT TO THE TEST.
IN consequence of the many cycle acci-
dents that have occurred of late in Lon-
don, it has been suggested that the autho-
rities should adopt the German system of
permitting those cyclists only to ride who
can pass a- satisfactory examination.
Although the decision has not yet been
made public, it has been already settled
that such an examination shall be insti-
tuted. Part of it will be practical, and
every rider, to gain his certificate of pro-
ficiency, will have to give an exhibition of
his skill in Battersea Park. In addition to
this, he will have to satisfy the examiners
by written answers to a paper of questions.
.1/r. Punch has managed to secure an ad-
vance-copy of the first examination-paper,
with which every cyclist will shortly be
confronted. It reads as follows : —
1. Conjugate the verb "to sideslip." If
a rider A, on a bicycle B, meets two paral-
lel tram-lines CD on a muddy day, prove
that the meeting of AB and CD will pro-
~D
bably result in the equation: AB = A —
2. "Force is indestructible" (JOULE'S
law). Does this hold good in the case of
the Police Force P If a cycle A coincide
with a policeman PC at any given point,
calculate the amount of heat generated by
the violent impact of A on PC. According
to your experience, does PC + LSD = PC1 r
3. Solve the following problem. In a
narrow street, a large waggon is travelling
at the rate of 1 mile an hour. Behind the
waggon, a cyclist is travelling at the rate
of 5 miles an hour. Behind the cyclist, a
butcher's cart is travelling at the rate of
12 miles an hour. All are moving in the
same direction, and there is not room for
the cyclist to pass the waggon. What
should the cyclist do? Show that if he is
killed his death ia entirely due to his
"furious riding."
4. Translate into English, where possible,
and give suitable answers to the following
remarks: —
(a) "Take yer bloomin' pram, out of
my 'osses' way, can't yer P"
(ft) "Why donjer ring yer bell f"
(c) "Stop that blessed alarum I"
(d) "'Igherup there, gtoopidl"
(e) "Who 're yer talkin' to young man
if I likes to stand in the middle of
the road what business is it of yourn
which if I did my dooty I'd sum-
mons yer that I would dratted
imperence I"
When all the above sentences are being
addressed simultaneously to a cyclist, what
should he reply P
5. Give the derivation of the verb "to
scorch." What pace per hour, in your
opinion, constitutes "scorching "? Prove
by example that the mean velocity of any
given cyclist varies directly with the im-
agination of the nearest policeman.
6. Comment on this recently-discovered
fragment from the works of SOCRATES :—
.... "Wherefore of all accusations, oh
judges, this is surely the most unreason-
able. For my progress indeed was not due
to any strength of horses, but to severe
labour with my feet, the pedals also revolv-
ing by the same means. Therefore I,
journeying by means of my feet, am wholly
guiltless of wrongdoing in that I rode along
the footpath, the name itself showing that
it was designed for this very end. Yet,
by Zeus, these my accusers would exact
from me forty drachma! and costs, alleging
some byelaw as their plea. But they who
disobey byelaws, it seems, contribute to
the public revenue, than which no act
more clearly marks the good citizen.
Hence it is evident that he who breaks
most byelaws is the beet citizen, and yet
is he dragged before you, ye judges, as a
wrongdoer, rather than, as is fitting, ac-
corded public honour. Next, as touching
the watercart"

There was an eccentric “tribe" in those days who had a most ludicrous little way of creeping in and squatting on other people's property ; the more untenable the ground the more they gloated over
their brarery and sagacity in getting there. They relied on the charity of the invaded tribe for food and clothing, and the means of communicating with their friends. It was a transient joy, but afforded
them exquisite pleasure while it lasted.

TO BRIGHTON IN AN HOUR.
SIE,—It is prodigious! In my time, Mr. Punch, four hours
even for the fastest chaise would have been monstrous quick.
My barouche never did it in less. And now these railways of
yours carry down the Londoners in a quarter of the time. Gad,
Sir, it would have taken my breath away I
I go up to Brighton sometimes from here (I date from
the Elysian Fields), and float about for a time over the
Steine and the King's Road. There are some mon-
strous fine women there still, take my word for it, but
none of them like FITZHBRBERT. You never saw her, more 's the
pity. What d'ye think they 've done with her house and the
next one? They Ve turned one into a "Young Men's Christian
Association," and the other into a School Board Office. Gad,
Sir, what d'ye think of that? And they Ve made my Pavilion a
place for concerts, and there 's never a prize-fight in the town.
But the whole country 's going to the dogs. I used to think
a man who drank claret was a poor, effeminate creature, but he
was a downright, good, three-bottle man compared to your tee-
totalers, your three-teapot men, or whatever you call 'em.
But Brighton is not what it was. It has grown monstrous
large. In my time the sky was always clear, and now there 's
a devilish quantity of smoke. But the people seem to like that,
for the worst smoke of all—with the most devilish fumes and
smells—comes day and night from some chimneys belonging to
the Town Council. One of them is where they make that new-
fangled electric light. Light, by George! Why, the smoke
makes the town as murky and gloomy as Hades. Fact, Sir I
However, you all like coal-smoke now, even in London, for
you do nothing to diminish it. When you go travelling you
have a puffing, smoking machine in front of you, and you seem
to prefer it to four good horses in a barouche, which was vastly
agreeable, I assure you.
This brings me back to what I started with. I went to
Brighton by the first railway train which travelled there in an
hour. Gad, Sir, we went like the deuce I I paid nothing, for of
course no one saw me. Even your Psychical Society would not
have noticed me, but then they are the last people in the
world to see any of us, when we come back again. So I tried
those coaches called Pullman, which come from the old American
Colonies. Gad, Sir, it's a pity my father was so injudicious with
the colonists! He absolutely would not make those what d'ye
call "em concessions—those "graceful concessions "—even to our
own people. Damme, Sir, now you do nothing but make " grace-
ful concessions" to foreigners, and to anti-vaccination fools and
other fools at home! You '11 all be sorry for it some day. Gad,
Sir, it will cost you more than I did, and my debts were certainly
large, devilish large!
But you don't make other things graceful now. With all your
cleverness you have made no new street as good as my Regent
Street. As for Brighton, they have put up some statues near
my Pavilion, which, if you should see them, would make you
hurry to the railway station and come home in an hour, or faster
if it were possible. Damme, Sir. with their statues and their
smoke, they will be the ruin of Brighton I GEORGE, R.
P.S.—I still use my old signature, though it is now inaccurate.
A MUSICAL NOTE.—We regret to hear that Mr. EDWARD
LLOYD, the distinguished tenor, is about to retire. Why?
"LLOYD 's weakly " cannot be the reason, as he is a tenore rubux-
tisiimo, and going strong on his farewell tour de force. Per-
haps he will take anotlier tour, and " turn again," like WHITTING-
TON, in order to give that tone to musical society which will be
lost when he no longer adorns it. We may yet hope to hear
that when our excellent tenor talked about permanently retiring
he was not sticking to the exact truth, but that "he LLOYD to
us." EDWARD LLOYD has always been a retiring tenor, never
over-puffed and over-advertised. So why not remain with us and
be, as heretofore, invariably "retiring"?

THERE WAS A PUBLIC-HOUSE CLOSE BY ON THE OPPOSITE BIDE OF THE WAT!"
"WELL, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS HAVE IT YOUR SIDE!"
DARBY JONES ON RACING CONTRASTS.
HONOURED SIR,—At the Back-end of the
Season it seems, to paraphrase a well-
known Gallic Aphorism, toujours New-
market. There is no getting away from
the Headquarters of the Jockey Club. We
may make excursions to Nottingham,
Leicester, or Kempton Park, but back we
come again to the Ditch, like the Epi-
curean House-fly to the Domestic Sugar-
basin. The changes from the above-men-
tioned Annexes of Sport to the Centre ot
the Racing World are those which only
the Beau Brummella of the Turf can appre-
ciate. At Nottingham, for example, the
first Autumn Meeting coincides with the
Annual Goose-fair, and the Bipeds who
saved Rome are equal favourites with the
modern representatives of Bucephalus.
If it be any Augury of the Advent of the
Millennium, I may remark that the Not-
tingham Lambs lie down with the Geese

style Indeed, the whole town reeks with
the fragrance of Sage and Onions. From
the Lace-making Locality we probably
derive the famous but ill-rhymed Ballad
commencing,
"Goosey, Goosey Gander, whither do you wander?
Upstairs and downstairs, and in my lady's
chamber!"
The poet who put "wander" and "cham-
ber" in apposition may rank high as a
Bard, but his remarks about the Gander
are certainly applicable to Nottingham
during the Fair. The Gander wanders
everywhere. In fact, I marvel that he has
not entered for some of the Turf Contests
for he would have many Friends among tht
Backers.
As to Leicester, I have never been abk
to determine whether its celebrity rests oc

TURF REFORMS. A SUGGESTION.
"HOW DANGEROUS! ItEA LLY, I THINK HORSES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE PADDOCK!'
THE INDIAN RISING IN THE U. S. A.
OUR roving contributor, freshly released from Colney Hatch,
who, according to his own account, has been everywhere, and
done everything (and apparently everybody), sends us, a propos
of the present Pawnee Indian rising, the following highly-
coloured sketch of his own experiences with the same tribe.
Mr. Punch ventures to think that his correspondent, to say the
least of it, handles the truth somewhat carelessly. However, in
these days of tales by a DK ROVGF.BIXHON CRUSOE, what does it
matter? Here is the account.
"Some time ago—I cannot pledge myself* to the exact date—
my wild, adventurous spirit induced me to turn my back upon
civilization and all its hollow falseness—I hate any thing hollow
or false: even my hollow or false teeth I am never on good terms
with—and go forth (I could not go third, as all the trains of
prairie travellers were first-class ones) with a caravan of settlers.
And they were 'settlers,' too, these fellows! I soon tired of
them. May be, too, they tired of me, for, one morning, I saw
several of them eyeing first me and then a tall tree, around an
overhanging branch of which they had slung a rope noose. Of
course it would not have been noose—news, I mean—to me to
find that I was 'up a tree'; but, nevertheless, I left—and in a
hurry. To do this I had to borrow a pony (the four-legged
variety, not £25), and I borrowed it when the owner was not
looking. Then I rode—ah, how I rode! For four days and
nights I never drew rein as I galloped across the rolling prairie.
I supported myself upon ham sandwiches (cut thin, with plenty
of mustard), as I sped along. At the end of this time the pony
began to get hungry, so I rested him for ten minutes; then on
again until, without any warning, I suddenly dashed onto the
war-path of a band of Pawnee Indians. Wishing to impress them
at first sight, I allowed my pony to knock over a tepee and two old
squaws; then I jerked the bit out of his mouth and fell over his
tail on to the ground behind. The chief advanced to meet me.
I put out my hand; he placed his to his nose and extended his
fingers—it was the cabalistic sign! we were to be brothers. I
addressed them in their own figurative language thus: —
"' Listen to_ the li words of the paleface, and though his
face is pale, his heart is red (ditto his nose). Since two moons
* No ;"or we might be quite §ure you would hare done "so at the nearest
pawnbroker's, long since.—ED.
have sought the wigwams of the Pawnees. They are the bravest
of all warriors—("Waugh I it is well said! ")—and I would
dwell amongst them for ever. (Murmurs of mild disapproval.)
Speak, Big Bearl speak, Spotted Sapolio! speak, Cold-in-the-
Head 1 Is it peace or war between us? If the latter, I will leave
without any unnecessary delay.'
"My simple eloquence touched them. For a year I dwelt in
their tepees and rode in their 'happy hunting grounds.' I shot
their bison, their buffalo, end finally, their chief, for a trifling
loan. This last transaction, unfortunately, caused a coolness
between Potted-Meat and myself. I determined to escape—but
he and I had a split wigwam between us, and it was difficult.
Waiting until the chief had indulged largely in the fire-water of
the paleface ('V.S.O.' warranted to kill at forty paces), I leaped
upon a tame bison, shook my rifle defiantly at the redskins,
dodged a brick, and went straight out into the wide world again.
[We take this opportunity of saving that we have not made inquiries and
satisfied ourselves of the truth of this exciting narrative. On the contrary,
we should describe it, from end to end, as a stately lie.—ED.]
A GRIEVANCE TAKING RANK.
MB. PUNCH,—SIR,—I see that complaint has been made that
Major MARCHAND, of the French Army, has been referred to in
official dispatches as "Monsieur," and consequently deprived of
hfs military title. I regret to see that Lord SALISBURY, an
officer himself (for he is entitled to wear a sword, and a naval
uniform, as Warden of the Cinque Ports), is responsible for this
breach of politeness.
Mr. Punch, Sir. When I say breach of politeness—hang me—
I put it very mildly. But what is done over here? I am an old
Militiaman of some twenty or thirty years' standing, and yet
my most intimate friends and the public generally ignore my
rank I It is disgraceful in both cases! Yours indignantly,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THB UMBRELLA-MAKER AND. THE BAROMETER.
A FABLE.
THERE was once an umbrella-makerj who kept and ill-treated
a harmless barometer. On one occasion, when, not a drop of
rain had fallen for many weeks, and the English people, beneath
a cloudless sky, had almost forgotten how to use his wares, ruin
stared him in the face and prompted him to still greater violence.
Every morning he looked out upon the parched earth and the
rainless heavens, and then, and at intervals during the day, he
cursed, and struck, and shook the innocent instrument, as though
its indications were the cause of the depression in his trade.
But the gentle barometer bore it all without complaint, and
steadfastly pointed to the truth.
"Miserable thing!" shouted the frenzied manufacturer, "you
are worse even than the barometer of the Swiss hotels, which
likewise always points to Set-Fair, for nobody ever troubles to
look at it, as every one knows that it never points to anything
else. You, howeverj with your priggish virtue, force even the
inconstant English climate to support your ridiculous assertions.''
The wretched man became indifferent to everything; he cared
not for the latest news from Africa; he only remarked that even
in the Soudan it rained sometimes. His friends, in a vain effort
to cheer him, had taken him to see pictures of grey skies and wet
days in various exhibitions, but he had become only more de-
pressed when he saw nothing but walking-sticks left in the
entrance-halls. He mentioned mournfully that it had been
cloudless at Henley, and that the Botanio Gardens had been
watered on the occasion of a fete.
At last, however, the sunshine recorder at Westminster rested
after the long period of overwork, the soft south wind sighed
once more, and the umbrella-maker left off sighing altogether.
"Ha, ha!" he cried to the barometer, which moved slowly to
Fair, to Change, "deceptive instrument, made to mislead man-
kind, confess that I have conquered! Your lies are at an end,
your shameful pride will have a fall, you are going down. I
told you so." And he swore yet again.
"\es," answered the barometer—at least, so says the umbrella-
maker, "I am going down. A barometer.like a camera or like
GEORGE WASHINGTON, cannot tell a lie. What a fool you were
not to turn your attention to parasols!"
In ^sop's time, when men, of more heroic mould, displayed a
calm indifference to phenomenal remarks from dumb beasts and
even from inanimate objects, these words would have caused no
surprise. But at the end of the nineteenth century, such ob-
servations are obsolete and absurd. The plain wits of the
umbrella-maker, already enfeebled by anxiety, gave way beneath
the shock, and, when at last the gentle rain came down and um-
brellas went up, he was trying to persuade the other inmates of
the lunatic asylum that barometers can speak.
Moral.—Never swear, even at the weather or at scientific
instruments, and never pursue any avocation that depends upon
the English climate, whether it be cricket or the manufacture of
umbrellas, unless you can hedge by combining the two.

SCENE—The Central Criminal Court. Two months later. The Chiej
of Police in the Dock.
The Judge (summing up). This is a most painful case. A
serious assault, accompanied by murderous violence in broad day-
light, takes place in Westminster. What is Society about?
Such a state of things is dangerous and intolerable. If Society
did its duty, there would be no criminal class to commit these
crimes. The Chief of Police represents Society in serious
offences of this kind. (The Chief of Police quails beneath the
glance of the learned judge as he glares at the occupant of the
dock.) I am not sure whether, in so disgraceful a case, it is
not my duty to order a flogging. (The Chief of Police trembles.)
Nothing else seems effectual to put a stop to these homicidal
assaults. I will, however, give you one more chance. You will
go to prison for twelve months.

Or captured here and there a few
To figure in my tropic Zoo.
After miraculous escapes
From death in most unlikely shapes,
I entered, feeling very dry,
This putrid caravanserai.
Forth from my damaged dressing-bag
I fetched the lately-mentioned flag,
Unfurled it with a silent wink,
And called for something cool to drink.
Hélas ! the Dervishes had come
And lifted all the local rum,
And would be soon returning, drunk,
To mutilate my headless trunk!
A trifle parched about the throat,
I now observed, a foreign boat;
And though I hit it in the side
Unfortunately no-one died.
Just then the SIRDAR's little plan
Came nicely off at Omdurman;
And if the SIRDAR hadn't won
I don't know what I should have done.
The barge in which I made a dent
Told him of my predicament
And, fearing I should come a mucker,
He flew to my immediate succour.
He burst upon my horrid gloom
With “Major MARCHAND, I presume!”
“Sir KITCHENER!” I cried, and leapt
Into his arms and fairly wept!
Briefly, he asked me in to mess,
And you will very rightly guess
That, being hollow as a bell,
This suited me extremely well.
He talked, without the least defiance,
About the pioneers of Science,
And asked if I had ever seen
A party known as Truthful GREEN.
Egypt of old had known a lot,
And there on that Egyptian spot
He welcomed in the KHEDIVE's name
A man of scientific aim.
If ever—this was by the way-
I cared to take a holiday,
Either in France or anywhere,
Hled very gladly see me there.
Our conversation, for the rest,
Revolved around my medicine-chest;
And hoping I should find it handy
He sent me round a case of brandy.
And now Sir KITCHENER has gone!
I wish he could have lingered on;
He smiled in such a charming manner
On noticing my little banner!
We have, of course, the brandy neat,
But then there's nothing here to eat;
And though, just now, we're going
strong,
The brandy cannot last for long.
Finding, in fact, my present site
Somewhat objectionably tight,
With your permission-c'est à dire,
French leave-I think I'd better clear.
So, by the time this reaches you,
I and my doughty little crew
Propose to scuttle, if we may,
With British guides to show the way.
Picture us therefore in the act
Of bounding down a cataract,
Or all aboard the Cairo mail
Careering on the homeward trail.

The walking here is very warm,
Especially in uniform.
By day the Dervish on our rear
Would prod us with his beastly spear:
By night I lay awake in bed
With lizards humming round my head.
Enormous gnats, by way of chaff
Kept browsing on my turgid calf ;
And alligators used to bite
Great chunks of our theodolite.
Twice I remarked a panther's cub
Wading across my morning tub;
And once a lion combed his mane
Just underneath my counterpane.
When these disputed my advance,
I floored them with the flag of France;

OR EXPECTATIONS.
THE COMPLETE STORY WBITEB.
v.
WITH the help of the valuable advice we
have given him, the young author should
now find no difficulty in writing stories
which will be joyfully accepted by the
leading magazines. Only one matter re-
mains to be dealt with, namely, how to
give these stories satisfactory conclusions.
This is most important, because the effect
of a tale depends so much upon its ending;
indeed, the young author may be advised
to write the last sentence first, and then
to Work backwards from it. The following
examples are good, trustworthy conclusions
of the most popular kind, which may be
safely recommended for imitation.
1. The Placid Ending.—This is suitable
for an old-fashioned love-story, and is much
liked. It is usually preceded by a row of
asterisks, and is written in the historic
present: —
Two years have passed since that me-
morable day. They have left MARIAN
unchanged, save for a grey hair shewing
here and there amid her golden tresses.
But to JASPER her beauty seema to in
crease as each month goes by, nor does
his own handsome face bear any traces of
that terrible night when, after three hun-
dred pages of weary waiting, he met anc
finally overthrew the wicked villain. The
past is dead, the present smiles upon them
and they await the future bravely, for they
face it hand-in-hand.
2. The Melodramatic Ending.—Quite a
contrast to the first example, but decided)j
effective, and, if the story is to be il
lustrated, it gives the artist a bette
chance:—
"Your decision ia fixed?" asked MAE
OARET, quietly.
"Absolutely," said the other, a crue
smile playing about his lips. "Sir RICHARD
is a base and unprincipled profligate
Therefore, as your wicked stepfather, tra
ditdon compels me to resolve that you shaJ
marry him. Nothing that you can say wil
move me now."
"I have still one argument left," sai
the girl.
"You had better produce it quickly
then. We 're on the last page, and there'
nly room for a few words more. What is
our argument?"
"Thii!" cried MARGARET, and snatching
•i richly-jewelled dagger from the table, she
ilunged it into her heart!
3. The Historical Ending.—This is the
nly way of finishing off a "romance." Its
pecial merit, it will be perceived, is that
t leaves an opening for a sequel, if youi
editor and tie public will stand it:—
Thus, on the 13th day of May, in the
/ear 1751, did I, JOHN GUDGEON, bring my
wanderings to a close. Of what befell
R.ETJBRN and his wife beyond the seas, I
must not here speak, having a shrewd eye
or business, and the contract number of
thousand words being fulfilled. But this
much have I set- down plainly, being a
simple yeoman, with but little skill in pen-
manship. So, then, I kindle my pipe, with
a flask of right Rhenish at my elbow for
>romoting greater thankfulness, and bid
ny reader farewell.
4. The Indefinite Ending.—Very popular
at present, and perhaps the easiest of all
:o construct. Moreover, it will serve just
as well for the beginning of a story as for
ts close. To the Philistine render it may
seem a trifle unsatisfactory, but he must
console himself by remembering that it is
truly "artistic": —
'You think he will consent P" the girl
asked.
He sighed wearily. "I cannot tell.
How strange it .teems that we should sit
iere so calmly, when within a few minutes
the words will be spoken that will decide
the fate of our lives!"
"It is indeed strange!" she said, simply.
The moments passed in silence. The girl
looked out of window, watching without
interest the stream of traffic in the street
below. The man nervously smoothed his
hat. Then the clock on the mantelpiece
struck twelve, and he started to his feet.
"The hour has come," he murmured, nnd
walking across the passage, tapped gently
at the study-door.
"Come in 1" said a voice.
THE END.
THE CANNIBAL CHIEF TO HIS LOVE.
COME and meet me in the gloaming
On the Strand, my darling—Nay,
Not where Editors are roaming
On their hungry search for prey;
Not where Chronicles are calling
For my blood, my darling—No,
But where silver waves are falling
On the shores of Wcissnichtwo.
Come and meet me, 0 my dusky,
When the wombats homeward fly,
And the kangaroo grows husky
As ho carols in tie sky;
When the playful ostrich mocks us
In the twilight, and the or-
-nith orhyncoparadoxus
Lightly flits along the shore.
There, beneath the palm-tree's curtain,
On our island-home—I own
That the latitude "s uncertain
And the longitude unknown—
Shall our love disport at random
As we swim, sweet, I and you,
Through the wavelets, riding tandem
On a turtle built for two.

READING FOR THE RED.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,—No doubt you have
noticed a complaint made in the columns
of one of your contemporaries that Air.
UUDYARD K.IPUNG puts into the mouth ot
tne Briush solcUer language to which he is
entirely unaccustomed. 'Ihe writer of the
letter declares tnat all our red-coats are
men of taste and culture. And, Sir, he is
right. We are. If Sir ARTHUR SULLI-
VAN'S clever opera H.jif.fi. Pinafore (I
purposely ignore the name ot the librettist)
were revived, 1 believe it would attract
but few members of the United Service.
We warriors could not bear to hear the
slightest reference to the "big, big D,"
even when the "D" is spoken of in terms
of distinct disapproval.
However, as there is certainly a good
deal of talent in some of Mr. KUDYARD
KIPLING'S compositions, I venture upon a
suggestion which I feel sure he will be quite
ready to adopt. Let there be an edition
intended for our defenders only. In this
volume, " When the band begins to play"
might be rendered as "At the moment of
the orchestra commencing the overture,"
and any colloquial reference to Our Gra-
cious Sovereign might be altered to "Her
Majesty the QUEEN-EMPRESS resident in her
Berkshire Castle." If this were done, I am
sure there would be no more complaints.
Believe me, yours very faithfully,

DARBY JONES, RESENTSiAN :ASPERSION
ON NEWMARKET AND SPEAKS OF THE
CAMBRIDGESHIRE.
HONOURED SIR,—Yesterday I visited the
Princely Mansion of one whom I may call
an Aristocrat of the Ring, a Turf Titan,
who, by an Astute System of Wagering
such as might excite the envy of Mr.
TERAH HOOLEY and other speculators in
India-rubber Fixings and Medical Nick-
nacks, has acquired a Fortune which would
make many a Teutonic Potentate an Afflu
ent Ruler in the Fatherland. In his re-
cently-erected Suburban Palace my Es-
teemed Friend has naturally establishen
that First Requisite of an English Gentle-
man, to wit, a well-stocked Library, ren-
dering any visit to the neighbouring Free
Establishment wholly superfluous. Among
other many hundreds of Richly-bound
Thesauri, there are of course to be found
those Magnificent and Weighty Tomes
known as the EnfMclopcedia Hritannica,
without which no Domestic Circle can be
educationally happy, and which, thanks to
the lordlv enterprise of Printing House
Square, is now placed within reach of
both Patrician and Plebeian. My Friend,
who has but little leisure for studying
Prose or Poetrv his spare moments being
generally devoted to the refreshing relaxa-
tion of Pool, Skittles, Poker and Solo
Whist, nnd being moreover not what is
called a Man of Letters, requested me to
consult the ^lagnum opus in question with
j regard to its opinion of Newmarket. I
could scan-u believe my eyes, nor he his
ears, when I read : —
"Newmarket hat a fouieirliat prru/iar reputation,
nnd ii ca led the metjopol s of the Turf. The ra e-
course u four miles in length of elastic turf; some
hundred hor es may be setn exercising <m the
Down». There are teven race-mattings in the year.
ThiB and the neighbouring to«n of Royrton, on ih>
borders of Hertfordshire, have olten been fn-quen,ed
by roja'ty. Many houses are inhabited by patrons
of the Turf. Our literature abounds »ith re er-
cnce» to Newmarket, which, truth to nay, are of an
u'iji'altering ditniption."
The italics are mine own. "A some-
what peculiar reputation"! "References
of an unflattering description "! What does
this Britannic Encyclopaediast mean? Ac-
cording to his own showing. Royalty and
Patrons of the Turf visit and reside in this
Strictly-correct Town, which I have never
seen alluded to by Literati save in the
terms of the Highest Eulogy, the charges
made by the Jockey Club always excepted.
Why, then, this thusness? as the Come-
dian says in the Play. Captain KRITERION
suggests that the B. E. had had a differ-
ence with the Stewards of the Turf Parlia-
ment, but you will notice, honoured Sir,
that the Mysterious and Damnatory Lines
aforesaid are not in any way directly con-
nected with Equine Contests. The Riddle
seemed as Dark as the Prehistoric Ages,
when happily I came into contact, at Sun-
down Park, where I went after all, with
your Amiable and Talented Friend Sir
FRAISKR PUNNETT, and to him I explained
the Dilemma of my Understanding. He
laughed heartily, and then said:
"These Great Books of Reference are
compiled by Scholars of the most profound
Learning, who live in a World all their
own. No doubt the Writer of the Articl°
in question turned up 'Newmarket' at
the British Museum. What did he find?
Something of this kind: 'Newmarket
Heath notorious for the exploits of High-
waymen, especially of CLAUDE DCVAL,' and
so on. That would be quite enough for
him. Hence the ' peculiar reputation,' and
the 'unflattering description." He still be-
lieves that CLAUDE DCVAL A Co. ride about
Baying, 'Stand and deliver." Perhaps they
do, hut we don't cull them Highwaymen
n< wadays, eh, Mr. JONES?"
And with this he disappeared into the
Members' Enclosure. Greatly relieved. I
venture to strine toep<her some apprecia-
tions of the Cambridgeshire: —

Shanghai, Monday.—Reform is the order of the day. Candi-
dates for the Premiership are no longer examined in penmanship.
Yes, I have done much, but much remains to do. We must be
thoroughly western, and up-to-date. We must- What next?
Happy thought I I'll govern by journalism. I'll buy a news-
paper and " inspire " the articles.
Tuefday.—Have bought The Shanghai Chopsticks. Proprietor
at first refused to sell, but when I ordered the boiling oil he be-
came more reasonable. Editor reports that circulation is not
what it ought to be. Must see to this. Happy thought! Will
publish proclamation, "Any person found not in possession of
The Shanghai Chopsticks (current number) will be suicided."
Wednesday.—Editor reports extraordinary increase in circula-
tion. Office was besieged for several hours this morning, demand
being greatly in excess of supply. Now for business. Don't half
like the way Russia is going on at Port Arthur. Must take her
down a peg or two. Shall make speech to-night and have it
reported.
Thursday.—Russian Ambassador round in a fury. Wants to
know what I mean by speech. Endeavour to nacify him. but he
storms madly, and threatens to make me "a sphere of influence."
Begin to exolain that this is exactly what I am trying to mnke
myself, but Russians havs no sense of humour, and my remark,
intended to be facetious, only riles him. Set to work to con-
ciliate him. After he has blown off steam a little, he talks more
sensibly, and explains that Britain has become so cock-a-hoop
over my speech, there is no standing it. I sympathise; I say
I know what Britain can be. "Then." says he, "I insist upon
your snubbing her." I reflect. I don't quite see how
Happy thought! Yes, of course, I was mis-reported. "All
right!" I exclaim. "I'11 snub Britain. 111 kill reporter."
Friday.—This mornine The. Shanghai Chopsticks contained the
following paragraph: "The Emperor regrets that the report of
his speech contained in our issue of yesterday's date is entirely
?rroneous. The reporter has been beheaded." There I I
thought, that will set everything right. But I was mistaken,
fust as I was lunching (capital puppy-pie), who should appear
but the British Ambassador. If Russia was angry yesterday,
what was Britain to-day? What did I mean by Killing the re-
porter? Did I take the British Lion, for a Tame Tom Cat, that
would meekly put this insult in its pipe and smoke it P I assured
the British Ambassador that I was under no such delusion; that
so far from wishing to offend Great Britain For a long time
he refused to listen, but when his wrath had somewhat subsided,
he explained that Russia had become intolerably conceited after
the snub I had given to Britain. I sympathised; I said I knew
what Russia could be; in fact we quite warmed to each other
discussing the foibles of pur common foe. "Of course," he said,
is he rose to go, "you will give a countervailing snub to Russia."
"Of course," I answered, "I'll kill another reporter." "Re-
porter be ," he exclaimed; "you must make it an editor."
I hesitoted. "What! You wont?" he cried. "I'll bring the
British fleet to Shanghai, and Lord CHARLES , he 's at Pekin
already." I hesitated no longer. "Very well," I cried. "I'll
crush Russia. I '11 kill the editor."
Salurdav.—Have walls ears? How else was my project
known? That editor, who owed me everything—why, his
circulation hnd gone up by leaps and bounds beyond all prece-
dent—what did he do? Oh! base ingratitude! Instead of cheer-
fully leaping into the boiling oil, he sent a wire to Auntie, and
Auntie came in a towering rage, and declared she had had
enough of my reforms and newspapers and western nonsense; and
she pulled me off the throne, shut me up in a dark cupboard, and
threatens me with suicide. Alas for the fate of those that are
born before their time! China :s not yet ripe for that great
institution, government by journalism. I fear she is fitter for
Auntie.

DIARY OF A WOULD-BE MEMBER OE PARLIAMENT
[A propes of the withdrawal of Mr. GWLLYM ETANS, formprly Libern
candidate for the Carmarthen and Llanelly Boroughs, a daily paper rcma'kx
that in a large number of constituencies the essential qualities of a goo<
Party candidate are neither eloquence nor knowledge, but an imperturbablt
good temper, a thick skin, and a long purse.]
October 1.—Have decided to contest the borough of Little
Pedlington. I am the re\erse of eloquent, and have no know-
lodge whatever, but my temper is good, my skin thick, and my
purse long. The present Member, on the contrary, though n
sound politician, is poor, and lacks imperturbability. Agent
says I have a good chance of election, and wants to know in whoso
interest I am going to stand. "My own," I reply. Ha is suit-
ably impressed by my candour.
October 5.—Have been round constituency, kissed all the babies,
and shaken hands with all the chimney-sweepers. Unpleasant,
but must keep up my character for good temper.
October 10.—Opposition paper says I 'm a carpet bagger, a cur
and a fool. Remember my thick skin and smile genially. Sub-
scribe to Football Club, Hockey Club, Working Men's Providen*
Club, Dispensary, Hospital, Soup-kitchen, Blanket and Beef-tef
Fund. My wife opens four bazaars, and buvs largely at each.
T lay a foundation stone, and answer (favourably) twenty begginp
letters. Wem.—Tiny in a stock of cheque-books.
October 30.—Made my first speech in constituency. No orator
and nothing to say, but remembered that that is of no importance
Several eggs thrown at me. Aboufc to protest, but apent's eve
upon me. Assumed imperturbability; thanked my audience for
this token of their friendship, and hoped the next eggs would be
fresher. This suggestion received with cheers. Aeent snys T
made a favourable impression. Subscribed to local Children'"
Holiday Fund, local Orphan Asylum, local brass band. Answered
forty beggine letters. Favourably, of course.
December 15.—Made my second speech. Much disturbance ftt
back of Hall. Several of my constituents hurled uncomnlimpn-
tary epithets at me, and two invited me to fight. Smiled blandlv
remembering the necessity of a thick skin. Thirk skull al»^
essential, apparently, for brick-bat caught me on the head as T
emerged from the buildintr. No matter. Agent savs things «r-
eoine splendidly. Opened another bazaar, and laid another
foundation stone: became president, of three footbnll clubs, or"*
hockey club, and the Blanket find Beef-ten. Fund, with enhance'1
subscriptions in each case. Liberal donations to "waits," care'
singers, bell-rrno-ers, children's Christmas tree, old men's Christ
mas dinner, ol 1 women's Christmas Goose Club. 3/>m.—'Re-
plenish purse. Winter always an expensive time, mv agent tells
me. Shall be grateful for Spring. Received sixty begginr
letters.
March 26.—Aenin visit Little Pedlington. Opposition paper
has been pryincr into mv familv affairs. Says mv father was ir
receipt, of ou*-door relief, and hints that mv wife is no be^t"'
than she should be. Inclined to resent this. b«t nsrent says tha*
would be thin-skinned. Write a humorous letter to the nape*-
instead deprecating these aspersions. Accented the nres'denc'
of three cricket clubs, a tennis club, a trolf club, a skittle cl"b. -
bofltinir club, a croquet club, and a club for placing bowls. Sub.
scribed suirnblv to each. Summer no better than Winter. "ft»-
nil, as far as subscriptions are concerned. Shook bands with a'7
the chimney-sweepers again, and re-kissed the babies after rn-
long absence. Agent assures me my popularity is something
wonderful. Have promised my support to Women's Suffrage
Old Aee Pensinns, One Man On« Vote. Anti-Va.crination. War'''
Closing, Local Option, Hom« Rule for Wales. Scotland. Irelam1
the Isle of Wiirht, and the Isle of POPS. Received, and answerer!
one hundred beeeing letters, enclosing something in reply tc
each. Purse fetHnp verv lean indeed.
July 10.—At Little Pedlington to open Flower Show (tn
which T am a handsome subscriber^. Next week. Fruif nnrl
Harden Snow, to be followed bv Cat, Show, Do" Show, Cattle
?how (and Doerle Show, for ought T know). Shall onen earb in
turn, and meantime subscribe to all of them. Almost afraid to
zo to b«nk, where mv account is seriouslv overdrawn. If this
sort of thing continues, I shnll have to retire from the contest.
Opposition newspaper more and more venomous. Agent says it's
a tribute to mv success. If mv election prospects were pot so
good, it would not be worth their while to attack me. News-
oaper talks about my bribine the electors. Ah«mrd. Aeent as-
sures me I have done nothin<* forbidden bv the Corrupt Practices
Act. Am elad to ^ear it. Don't want to snend five thousand n
venr on "nursing" a constituency only to be unseated on peti-
tion.

of the opposition redoubled. I remain imperturbable. Am get-
ting used to it now. I allow any one to kick me so long as he

ALL WRITE!
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Did you see this notice among the "Situa-
;ions Vacant," in the Times?
"SALARY to young UNIVERSITY MAX.—Well-rrad man, literary
taste, not afraid of hard work, to assist in preparing advertisements. £2
weekly, rapid increase if able to write."
:< If able to write," indeed! Educational reformers demand too
much of the Universities, but surely, I thought, surely they go
in thoroughly for the three R's, at any rate. Judge of my
astonishment when I turned a page and read in the same issue,
"n a scholarship announcement:
"Candidates should communicate their wish to stand to the Mnstpr of Poni-
>roke on or before November 26. Those who have been unable to cominimi-
•ale by letter should call on the ilouter."
The italics, Sir, are mine. What a shocking state of affairs!
What is the use of our discussing schemes for teaching our future
lousemaids to play the piano, our future ploughmen the elements
of electro-biology, if our University candidates cannot write? I
expect daily to see other advertisements, such as this:
University graduate wanted. One who can write a little
jreferred," or "M.A. required for City office. Only those who
can add up figures need apply."
Yours truly, D. UNDERHEAD.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. CLARK RUSSBLL has been writing lor so long, and so
brilliantly, that an insatiate public would not have just cause to
complain if, like other rich mines, he gave signs of panning out.
The Romance of a Midshipman (FISHER UNWIN), his latest pro-
duction, will, my Baronite confidently affirms, rank among his
best. It is full of those inimitable touches of description which
bring the sight of the sea to the eyes, its scent to the nostrils,
its multitudinous murmuring to the ear. CLARK RUSSELL, alack!
has not looked upon the ocean for many years. To rend his last
book, one would mink he had just come off a voyage, with memory
saturated with the sea in its infinitude of moods and aspects.
Every page pulsates with adventure. DE ROUGEMONT (writing
the name makes my Baronite GRIN), in the highest flight of his
imagination, has nothing to equal the incident of meeting the
abandoned ship, with only a lion for captain, a snake and a
monkey for crew. Or, even more fantastic, the floating island
with the sea-worthy schooner, providentially for the castaways,
docked in its midst. In the opening chapters Mr. RUSSELL
breaks fresh ground with an account, evidently reminiscent of
personal experience, of a French school for English boys. This
is as good as chapters in DAUDET'S Jack, or Du MAUHIER'S Peter
Ibbetson.
Messrs. CHATTO AND WINDTIS have brought out a revised and
enlarged edition of The Reader's Handbook, with its lucid
explanations and allusions, references, dramatic plots and
classical stories. The familiar and indispensable work has a
pathetic interest in its new dress, since the preface is written
by Dr. BREWER'S daughter. He, "the onlie begetter" of the
book, died in March last year, before he had finished correcting
the proofs of the revised edition. He has left behind him a
monument of intelligent, well-directed assiduity that will be as
enduring and far more useful than anything, how costly soever,
that might be turned out in marble. Our old friend needs no
introduction. But it may be said that in his new dress he is
portlier than ever, the revised edition numbering 1,501 pages
as against 1,399 of its predecessor. As each page is a mine of
'nformation, my Baronite thinks this will he welcome news.

AS NOW WORN; OR, THE CENT'S ARBITER OF FASHION.- 1.
DEAR BASIL,—As you are still ruralising in the Far West of
England, you will doubtless like me to keep you informed of the
latest sartorial news from Tooley Street and other head-quarters
of masculine fashion.
In the first place, I see in this morning's paper that the new
dress-coat, which is ready to be launched for the forthcoming
winter, will have the lappel decorated with raised floral designs
instead of the usual plain silk facings. This is not quite correct.
I have private information from a very high authority that the
really dressy fracs will have lappels of art-canvas picked out in
zigzag tapestry pattern with l°mon-yellow and pea-green
eighteenth-century cross-stitch. The body of the coat, it is
whispered, will show a welcome change in colour from the cus-
tomary black to the charming tint known as vieux vert de bouteillr,
and should be quite shiny. Let me give you a hint, if you want
to obtain the dernier cri in this style. You cannot do better
than go to Messrs. MOYSES & Co., the celebrated outfitters of
Petticoat Lane, and get them to supply you with a well-matured
habit <Foccasion. Your nearest female relative should then hem
on to the lappels two carefully-shaped gores, cut from one of her
grandmother's samplers, if she is so fortunate to possess such a
treasure. (If not, it may, no doubt, be picked up in Wardour
Street.) Another useful wrinkle is to have one of the new com-
bination "dickey "-and-wais+coats, brought out by an inventive
peer of my acquaintance. They have no back, and hang on one
button at the neck. On account of the soot-ness of the London
climate, they are made to turn. A great saving in your washing
bill caa. thus be effected. Lord X.'s invention is really one of
the most ripping ideas I have heard of for a long time. With a
few touches to the pantalon, the costume is equally suitable for
a fancy-dress ball or one of those delightful Cinq-Novembre parties
now being made up in town and country. Any how, thus ar-
rayed, you will no longer be mistaken for a waiter. As to your
neck-wear, see my next. ZEDWHYEKS.

"THE STUPENDOUS UNDERTAKING OF HONEST JOHN."

DE "VOCE" POPULARI.
THE Cambridge Express, in giving a biographical sketch of Sir
JOHN VOCE MOORE, the Lord Mayor Elect, says, that it was in
the rooms over Mr. VOCE MOORE'S shop at Cambridge that " Hie
A. D. C. gave their first performance." Not exactly. There
was an entertainment given, in the rooms of 24, Trinity Street,
by the three undergraduates who then "kept" there, which con-
sisted of a play written for the occasion by one of the Founders
of the Feast, which feast, in the shape of a prodigious supper,
immediately followed upon the fall of the curtain. Further this
deponent will not say, but he has a fixed idea that the worthy
landlord of these Three Jovial Undergraduates, not entirely
approving of the "subsequent proceedings," did enter a personal
protest against the lateness at the hour, and also against the
demonstrative and somewhat noisy joviality then at its height.
This protest was, of course, enthusiastically received by the
hilarious guests, mostly "Freshmen," getting fresher-men every
minute, with cheers and bumpers to the health of the justifiably
irate landlord, who, it may be, had it not been for this acclaim
awakening in him all his latent ambition, would never have sat
in the chair of WHITTINGION as Sir RICHARD VOCE MOORE, Lord
Mayor of London I
THE EQUALITY OF THE SEXES.
(fragment from a JlaUer-of-fact Romance.)
SHE had been working through the livelong night. Her hus-
band had been asleep while she was sweeping the floor, washing
up, and mending the clothes. Every now and again he would
awake, and with the reverse of a blessing, command her to labour
with greater vigour. But these interruptions were few and far
between. Beer had closed his eyelids, and tobacco had made
him droway. Now and again she would look at the clock
anxiously.
"Just five," she murmured, "and the Act fixes the hour for
six." And once more she would plod on, knowing that it would
be death, or, to speak by the card, a thrashing, if her lord and
master found her loitering.
At length the hour of deliverance struck, and she knew herself
to be free.
"My breakfast," grumbled the man.
"You will find it on the table. And now the law lets me rest."
"Lets you rest? What do you mean?"
"Why, lets me work!"
And she disappeared, to enjoy in the factory employment in-
finitely less arduous than the squalid duties of a drunkard's home.

That the French specimens be added, ex officio, to the Cabinet,

That the German specimens be allowed to revise their Emperor's

for a lifetime.
That Russian specimens remain at Siberia, where most of
them are.
That American specimens be converted into a company, >and
allowed to see if they can run .their notions on business

Finally, that all and every of them are invited to practise
annihilation, by commencing the process by the abolition ot

"I BEE YOU 'RE GOINO TO HAVE A NEW HORSE, OLD CHAP I"

'WELL, YOU 'VB GOT THE FRAME-WORK THERE, HAVEN'T YOU?'
CONFIDENCES.
(Extracted from Mr. Punch's Post-bag.)
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I am in a difficulty,
and I am sure that you, with your usual
kindness of heart, will help me if you can.
My trouble can be stated in a single sen-
tence—I want to be a heroine, and some-
how I can't succeed, though I Ve followed
carefully all the directions. Why is this P
It began a month ago, when I happened
to overhear my mother speaking about me
to a visitor. After praising my sisters in
an absurdly exaggerated way, she added
that "poor ETHEL was rather common-
place." Of course, I wasn't meant to
hear, but that made it all the worse.
"Commonplace!" The word rankled in
my heart; I resolved at all costs to be
commonplace no longer. And, as the
simplest oure, I decided to become a
heroine; one of those delightful girls
whom one meets in novels, and witt whom
every one—even the worst characters in
the book—falls in love. Her parents adore
her, her sisiters play second fiddle to her
with unselfish readiness, and, in short., she
has the best possible time in every way.
Most of the rules seemed easy enough
to follow out. First of all, I must Le
simply dressed in white. I have several
white frocks, so there is no difficulty about
that. They are a trifle cool in this weather,
but of course one must expect to have to
make some sacrifices. And, again, there
is no trouble in procuring a single red rose
to nestle lovingly at my throat. It tickles
a good deal, and I should prefer to wear it
elsewhere, but, as I said, I don't mind
some discomfort if I can become a heroine.
Another rule is that I mustn't eat much
at meals—I must toy with the delicacies
heaped on my plate. I did this for two
days, making up afterwards with chocolates
in my bedroom. Likewise the heroine is
expected to apeak in a sweet and gentle
voice: generally speaking, we are rather a
noisy family, but I cultivated the sweet and
gentle voice also for two days. At the end
of that time my mother said I was " bilious"
—a horribly coarse expression—and wanted
to send for the doctor. When I protested
that I was quite well, my father said that
it all came from silly affectation. Now,
you know, a heroine's parents don't treat
her in that way. "Darling ETHEL," they
should have said, "she must have some
secret sorrow," and then they ought to
have tended me with thoughtful solicitude.
I have not had a pennyworth of thoughtful
solicitude up to the present time.
Let me add one more example of my
r-'sfortunes. Last night I went to a dance
nt the JOHNSONS'. A dance is the heroine's
great opportunity, and all through the
evening I copied the very best examples
in my behaviour. Presently I found my-
self sitting put a dance with young Mr.
TEMPLETON in the conservatory. Now, a
heroine never sits out a dance in the con-
servatory without carelessly picking a
flower to pieces. Don't misunderstand
me to mean that I care two straws for
Mr. TEMPLETON, because I don't. But I
didn't see why that should make any dif-
ference, so I carelessly picked a flower to
pieces—lots of flowers, in fact. Just then
Mr. JOHNSON happened to enter the con-
servatory, and when he saw what I had
done, his language was simply dreadful.
It appears that he collects orchids, for
which he pays absurd prices, and that I
had quite destroyed aome of the most
valuable specimens. But, I ask you, was
it my fault? As a heroine, could I have
acted otherwise?
Please give me your advice, and earn my
eternal gratitude.
Yours sincerely, ETHEL LOBRIMER.
'THE TRIPE SEASON HAS BEGUN."

I CRAVE no haunch of stricken deer,
No calipash or calipee,

DEAR PUNCH,—I am not one to bellow,
Nor am I much on bloodshed bent;
I 'm not a tearing Jingo fellow,
All fuss, and froth, and discontent.
If, duce COOK, the KAISER travels,
And cracks his jokes o'er ABDUL'S wine,

These vaunted tours, I simply won't.

He likes his ABDUL, others don't.
And though from far Armenian mountains
A whisper come of grief and fear,
The KAISER keeps designing fountains
Absorbed in work, and will not hear.
Or. " Pooh, Sir, pooh!" retorte the KAISER,
Armenia's poor and very far:
A dose of killing makes men wiser:
Hoc dixi: WILHELM, I. et B."
Andj therefore, if to spend her leisure
His wife walks out on ABDUL'S arm,
Why, let the EMPRESS take her pleasure;
It's not for me to think it harm.
Not against these I preach my sermon;
A different nation gives me pause:
Who cares for Ottoman or German,
For ABDUL'S faults or WILHELM'S flaws?
Let others or denounce or flatter

We have another, sterner matter—

And sent him merely to annoy.
So be it then: we know what's what now,

He 's got to pack and go—that's flat.

A NEW PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY.
["The professions are overcrowded. From
schoolmasters, barristers, doctors and men of letters
comes the same complaint."—Daily J'aper.]
IN view of this unfortunate overcrowding
which is prevalent in the liberal profes-
sions, our readers will be glad to hear that
a Society for the Rescue of Unsuccessful
Professional Men is in process of formation
under the highest patronage. The Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Authors
views the project with a benevolent eye,
and several members of Parliament are in
favour of the scheme. We have been fa-
voured with an advance copy of the Presi-
dent's inaugural address, which runs as
follows :—
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,—
The objects of the society whose
inauguration you witness this evening—the
Society for the Rescue of Unsuccessful
Professional Men—are sufficiently indi-
cated by its title. The S.R.U.P.M. aims
at the relief of a deserving and necessitous
class, whose need of charitable assistance
is too glaring to require demonstration.
There are, according to the report of our
Committee of Inguiry at least five hundred
medical men in the West End of London
who are unable to earn their bread. We
have already on the books of the Society
the names of six hundred schoolmasters,
three hundred barristers, five hundred
painters, one thousand writers of fiction,
and eighty minor poets, in the last stages
of indigence. We hope, with the aid of
the funds at our disposal, to rescue at least
a thousand of such persons every year from
destitution, and put them in the way of
earning an honest living. Half of this
number, after having been taught a trade,
we shall ship to one of HER MAJESTY'S
colonies, where they will be able to make
a fresh start in their new callings, unham-
pered by disastrous memories of their
former professions. The other half will
be distributed among our great cities or
among the country districts as labourers,
artisans, and the like, where it is believed
that a career of humble usefulness can be
secured for them. (Hear, hear.)
Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will like
to know what occupations we have found
most suitable to these unfortunate victims
of competition in the learned professions.
This is a question to which we nave given
much earnest thought, and the conclusions
your committee have arrived at are as
follows: Every man's new calling should
as far as possible be such that he will be
able to make some use of the knowledge
which he was compelled to acquire in order
to qualify for his former profession. This
will diminish the amount of special train-
ing required in each case, and so lighten
the labours of the society. Thus the un
successful medical man, having some
knowledge of anatomy, will become
butcher; or if he has made sanitation his
special study, we shall suggest his setting
up as a plumber. The necessitous barrister
will be given an opportunity of qualifying
as a commercial traveller, a calling for
which his previous intellectual training
will especially fit him; or, if he has a gooi
address and en insinuating manner, he
would probably be fitted for any branch of
retail trade. The schoolmaster who can-
not obtain a post as a teacher of youth will
be advised to embark in the congenial
occupation of carpet-beating, an occupa-
tion in which his previous experience
should be of great assistance to him. The
artist will or course become a house-
painter, and we are assured by a com-
petent authority that, with a year's train-
ing, even an Academician will be able to
paint railings in an adequate manner. We
are informed that there is an immense
opening for good house-painters in South
Africa, and we hope to send out a large
consignment of bad artists to Cape Town
in the course of the next twelve months.
The real problem which we have had to
face is concerned with the disposal of the
large number of literary failures. No use-
ful occupation hag yet been found for the
multitude of minor poets who are likely
in the near future to apply to us for
assistance. To judge by their published
works these gentlemen are usually persons
of bad character, and it would therefore be
impossible to recommend them for any
positions of trust. It is suggested, how-
ever, that they might be employed in
running errands, and that the more muscu-
lar of them might break (.tones, or other-
wise make a living by road-mending. The
unsuccessful writers of fiction present an
even greater difficulty, since they are far
more numerous, while it is equally hard to
discover any kind of useful employment
for which they are fitted. It has been
decided that lady novelists who are in
necessitous circumstances should be taught
needle-work and scrubbing^ while the more
intelligent among them might be urged to
become domestic servants, a class for whom
there is an unlimited demand in America.
Those who show any aptitude for cooking
might very soon be in a position to sup-
port themselves and their families. Un-
successful men of letters, on the other
hand, would probably express a foolish dis-
taste for domestic service or for sweeping a
crossing, and for them some simple form of
handicraft would have to be discovered if
they were not to be a burden upon the
funds of the society. On the whole, they
seem best fitted for agricultural pursuits,
and the society would probably see its way
to having them taught ploughing and the
management of a farm before paying their
passage to one of the Crown colonies.
Some discussion followed, and a vote of
thanks to the President for his interesting
address closed the proceedings.

THE 'BUS DRIVER'S VADE MECTJM.
Question. What is the first duty of the
coachman of an omnibus?
Answer. To keep to time, and to nurse
rivals out of existence.
Q. What is the usual pace of an omni-
bus?
A. When free from competition, a cross
between a hearse and a piano-organ.
Q. And when the pace is unusual?
A. Then the horses, properly managed,
should give an easy heating to a full-speed
fire-engine.
Q. Is this speed not dangerous to the
public?
A. Certainly, but the danger is compen-
sated for by the prospect of ruin to the
rival company.
Q. Is it not requisite that a driver should
know London thoroughly?
A. Yes, and he is always equal to any
emergency.
Q. What would be the route, then, from
Knightsbridge Barracks to the Court
Theatre?
A. By the Brompton Road, past the
Oratory, through Thurloe and Onslow
Squares, down Bond Street, skirting Bel-
grave Square, and thence via Cadogan
Place into Sloane Square.
Q. But would it not be more direct to
proceed from Knightsbridge to the Court
Theatre by Sloane Street?
.4. Undoubtedly.
Q. Then why should an omnibus take so
circuitous a route to reach its destination?
A. Because it is the only possible route.
Q. Why?
A. Because the roads are up.
Q. Finally, do you consider the life of an
omnibus-driver a happy one?
A. A very happy one—when he's off

Turns our best pleasures to ashes,

You and your delicate craft.

Moistening it first at your lips,
As its proportions diminish
Touched by your soft finger-tips;

As we behold with dismay
How the infecting bacillus
Thus to our lips you convey.

None would partake of their pain;

Stick to the Whitechapel brand.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CAVIARE TO "THE GENERAL."
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—It seems that London is not the only place
where a revived interest is being shown in Macbeth.
I hear from Cambridge that candidates for the General Ex-
amination for the ordinary degree are being examined in the
play, and the subjoined paper seems to show that the examina-
tion is being conducted in no narrow or unduly academic spirit,
but is designed to be a real test of intelligent study and criticism.
You will gladly note this fresh proof of widening culture in
our ancient Universities.
MACBETH.
1. Compare Macbeth and Mr. McKiNLET, in respect of their
character and foreign policy. What other names do you know
which begin with "Mac "?
2. "What beast was it then
That made you break this enterprise to me?"
Lady Macbeth (Act I, Se. 7).
Answer this question, and give a list of the animals which
Macbeth says he would rather meet than the ghost of Banquet.
Is it your opinion that the recent Zoological Congress (at Cam-
bridge) was fruitful in results t
3. "Act I., Scene 1.—An open Place. Thunder and lightning.
Enter Three Witches."
Give the odds laid on Macbeth and Banquo respectively by the
Three Witches. Does the term "Place, used here, bear the
technical meaning put upon it in the case of HAWKE v. DUNN P
If so, estimate the Witches' liability—in pounds Scotch.
4. "The obscure bird
ClamourM the live-long night." (Act II., Sc. 3.)
Under what circumstances does the keeping of noisy fowls, to
the annoyance of neighbours, constitute a "nuisance" at law?
If you approve the emendation of the text which substitutes
"bard" for " bird," say so, and cite not more than, one hundred
names in this class.
N.B.—No marks will be given for mentioning the Poet
Laureate, unless you can quote the title of one of his works.
6. Describe, in terms of French cookery, the contents of the
Witches' cauldron, and explain the difference (if any) between
Hell-broth and Haggis.
6. Ynung aiward. Thou liest, abhorred tyrant 1
Macduff. Turn, hell-hound, turn! (Act V., Sc. 7.)
Do you consider this a proper way for one gentleman to address
another?
1. Do you consider that Macbeth had a "Political Mission,"
or is he to be regarded merely as an " Emissary of Civilisation "?
8. Give the substance of Macduff's remarks on the subject of
his family bereavement, and explain clearly his relationship to
the present Duke of FIFE.
9. "He 's here in double trust . . ." "We will proceed no
further in this matter, He hath honour'd me of late," &c., <fec.
(Act I., Sc. 7.)
Would these objections, urged by Macbeth, have entitled him to
a certificate of exemption as a "conscientious objector" (in the
view of a Metropolitan Police Magistrate), if vaccination and not
murder had been the practice objected to?
That is all the paper; and I am, yours obediently,
B. A. CANTAB. (POLL.).
AS NOW WORN; OR, THE CENT'S ARBITER OF FASHION.-2.
IN my last, I promised to touch on your tie. Well,—now,
»s to your neck-wear. I need not tell you that you had
better murder six maiden aunts, or habitually cheat at "bac,"
or, in fact, commit the most heinous crime in the calendar,
than be caught wearing a made-up white tie. Fashion has, for
some doubtlessly cogent reason, decreed that this is the lowest
depth of degradation to which the aspirant can sink—a more
fearful betise even than wearing a top-hat with a sacque coat.
You, of course, tie your own cravatei, but there is a right and
a wrong way to do this. You should practise for hours before
a looking-glass with a boot-lace round your neck. Time is no
object when the matter is of such vital importance. Take one
end of the lace, which must be exactly thirty-two inches long,
in your right hand, and pass it round the back of your collar,
holding the other end in your remaining hand, that is, your
left hand; you then pull the first end down, so that it lies
somewhat under the other end, in order that by a dexterous
movement of the right thumb and forefinger it may loop up at
a distance of ten and a half inches from the first end, which is
now caught crosswise over the left middle finger; then slip the
back part of the bend up towards the chin, and pull the two
loops through in reverse directions, and there you are. I hope
this is sufficiently clear to you. It really requires a lot of study.
I notice that one of our most important young dandies is

Miss Townley. "I THINK THE COUNTRY is JUST SWEET. I LOVE
TO SEE THE PEASANT RETURNING TO HIS HUMBLE COT, HIS STURDY
FIGURE OUTLINED AGAINST THE SETTING SUM, HIS FAITHFUL COLUE
AT HIS SIDE, AND HIS PLOUGH UPON HIS SHOULDER!"
wearing his back-hair cut in a V-shape and terminating in a point
over his lofty collar. This is very fetching and attractive, especi-
ally when he turns his back to you in the middle of an interview.
I am almost inclined to prophesy that the next mode will be to
grow the hair upwards and forwards over the forehead in the
manner of a cockatoo. The bowler hat will then be worn on the
back of the head, imparting a somewhat defiant and nonchalant
air, indicative of distant cousinship with the Services, now so
much to the fore.
There is a rumour that tooth-picks are coming in again. They
are now being made of celluloid, with the owner's crest and motto,
or failing these, his employer's trade-mark, stamped thereon.
A leading City clerk, noted for his exquisite refinement, yester-
day confessed to me that he used as many as four a day, one
after each meal, and sometimes an extra one in the street. This
sounds extravagant, if you use a new toothpick each time.
Second-hand ones, however, are not very good taste.
Have you heard of the language of waistcoat-buttons, and
character-reading by the shirt-cuff? It is quite the latest rage.
For instance, a white calico button on a tweed suit means "Can
you lend me a fiver?" and a missing one is equivalent to "Will
you be my wife?" A neutral-tinted shirt-cuff indicates a literary
turn of mind. A paper ditto signifies an income of £90 a year,
and so on.
The American accent is now largely worn in London, especially
on the stage. Some of our most enterprising iV»<m'.s 'premiers are
taking lessons in the correct intonation of "Right here," and
similar phrases, in order to pet engagements.
I am afraid I have somewhat over-run my limits, so will con-
clude for the time being, Your well-wisher, ZEDWHYEKS.
Sporting Prophet (playing billiards). Marker, here's the tip
off this cue, RS usual.
Marker. Yes, Sir. Better give us one of your "tips," Sir,
as they never rmne off.

FORE
and
AFT!
DARBY JONES ON "SPILT MILK."
IT may readily be allowed, honoured Sir,
that on Wednesday last the Fist of For-
tune was very busily pounding the Unfor-
tunate Backers, who imagined that the
Winner of the Cambridgeshire was as easy
to pick as a Ripe Pippin off the Tree. As
a matter of fact, there is no Contest of
the whole year so difficult to sift, and those
who were content to take 7 to 2 about
Craftsman, in a field of Twenty-six
Runners, must certainly have been struck
silly by the God of Wagering, who is, I
opine, Mercury, also the Patron of the
Knights of the Light Fingers. The start,
too, was not up to Mr. COVENTRY'S usual
form; and it is a Curious Commentary on
the Utterance of a Great Man, that directly
after J. TOD SLOAN, Esq. (U.S.A.), had
publicly announced that he much preferred
Mr. COVENTRY'S method to any Starting-
Machine in the World, he should have been
left at the Post, to reflect, perhaps, while
urging on Nunsuch, that to err is Human,
as well as Equine, Nature.
The Noble Army of Backers were routed
as completely at Newmarket as were the
Dervishes at Omdurman. The Slaughter
has indeed been Terrible, and the defeat
of Caiman in the Dewhurst Plate probably
added some fresh bits of "stiff" to the
Kites, which I am told, on the authority of
Captain KRITERION, are flying about Bur-
lington Gardens and vicinity like leaves in
Epping Forest. But, as a rule, the Kite-
flyer is also a Philosopher. He does not
go wailing about the Town like a Lady who
has had Her pocket picked of a 'Bus-fare.
On the other hand, the Gentleman of
Lavish Lucre, whose Money-bags have
been sweated to the Advantage of the
Metallicians, yells like a sick Thomas cat
which has upset a Ewer of Lacteal Fluid.
Sometimes he uses Language with regard
to Everybody connected with the Race,
from the Handicapper down to the Stable-
Boy, of a Nature utterly unfit for Publica-
tion. And again, he will whimper and
whine like a stricken Lap-doe because he
did not "spot" the chance of Georgic. In
short, honoured Sir, he is a fretful Porcu-
pine to all his friends and acquaintances.
This Manner of Man ought not to be
allowed to bet except in Marbles or Cho-
colate Creams. He seems to think that
somebody maliciously jogged his elbow,
and spilt the Milk which he was carrying
to his lips. I trust I shall not be accused
of aiding and abetting Immorality, if I say
I hold in far greater esteem the Napoleonic
Plunger who boldly avers that he intends
to "take the knock," than I do this Peris-
sological Pinwidgeon (epithet registered).
I confess that the Honourable FLIFLATT is
in my mental optic.
I hear rumours of vast numbers of
Spondulicks having been collected by
Mr. H. C. WHITE, Mr. F. DAY and
Antipodean Company (Limited), but in
my humble Sphere I only know of two
Individuals who trusted the Australian
Nag, the one a Fiduciary Undertaker,
who, having in '87 landed a 40-to-l
chance by reason of the victory of
Gloriation, has always had two Yellow-
boys on a 40-to-l chance in every Cam-
bridgeshire; the other a Schoolboy, who
is now studying the Antique Italian Poets,
and while intrusting Yours Truly with a
Florin for investment, informed me that
the writing out of a Georgic was a common
form of Preceptorial Punishment at his
Seminary. This time he wrote out his
Georgic to greater satisfaction. Had I
had his Educational Advantages, doubtless
I might have taken the Tip of Ingenuous
Youth; but, as it ia, I fear that if between
now and the Liverpool meeting, you would
wish me to enjov more Nutritious Fare
than is afforded by Adam's Ale and the
Staff of Life, you will honour the inclosed
small but important Acknowledgment of
Indebtedness to your Revered Self from
Your ever Subservient Satellite,
DARBY JONES.
P.S.—I should be grateful if you would
not cross any Financial Document bearing
your Signature, as I regret, to say that my
punv Banking Account is at the present
moment like a depleted Beer-barrel—over-
drawn.
[It is perhaps unnecessary to inform DARBY JONES
that our collection of his autographs is already so
large that we must decline to give our own in ex-
change for a fresh specimen of his signature. A
diet of bread and water will be beneficial to his
health and our pocket.—ED.]
MR. WILLIAM REDMOND'S SPEECH.
ADDRESSING a public meeting, Mr. WIL-
LIAM REDMOND, M.P., is reported to have
said that, "If England and France go to
war, his sympathy would be with France,"
and he then called for cheers for Major
MARCHAND.
The effect of this speech was far-reaching
—almost deadly in its stunning force. Its
importance can hardly be over-estimated.
Both England and France, for very dif-
ferent reasons, have been thrown into
convulsions. The French naturally see the
immense advantage which the sympathy of
Mr. REDMOND gives them, and are corre-
spondingly elated. To us, on this side of
the Channel, it is of course a crushing
blow. In fact, resistance seems useless.
In this emergency, is it too much to expect
that the Cabinet should be called together
to devise some means for propitiating Mr.
REDMOND, say, by prayer, or perhaps better
still, by the offer of a lucrative appoint-
ment, and inducing him to withdraw the
priceless blessing which he has offered, all
unasked, to the foes of the QUEBN he swore
fealty to f In the terrible event of the
hon. member remaining unmoved alike by
Erayer, entreaty, or reward, it were better
ir that England should unconditionally
surrender, than that she should fipht a
hopeless battle against France and the
Irish patriot combined. Todgers's might
well have been proud of such a man, and
who shall say but that the Three Tailors of
Tooley Street would have gladly taken
"power to add to their number," as the
company prospectuses have it, had they
enjoyed the inestimable advantage of a
personal acquaintance with Mr. WILLIAM
REDMOND?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"THE VALET OF THE NILE."
MUCH TALKED ABOUT, BUT VERY SELDOM SEEN!
THE MANOEUVRES OF JONES AT THE HAYMARKET.
What happened to Jones, as many theatre-goers are aware,
may be ascertained from information to be received at the Strand
Theatre; but what really happened to our " only JONES " (HENRY
AUTHOR "of that ilk ") to inspire him to write a piece for the
Haymarket, entitled, The Man(eucn\i of Jane, will remain a mys-
tery to those who, having probably something else with which to
occupy their attention, do not care to pursue the inquiry. HENRY
AUTHOR wrote "The. Strange Case of the Reverend Michael and
his lost Angel of Islington" (the exact title escapes oar memory,
but this is near enough to be pleasant), which eccentric dramatic
work "strutted its short hour on the stage and then was heard
no more," its brief candle sputtering out, unpuffed. And
probably the Henry Author-of-its-being, seeing something in
that creation of his fertile brain worthy ot preservation,
thought it would be as well to put a little of the old wine, home-
made, into another bottle, with a new label, for consumption at
the Haymarket. And so it comes about, that, as the designing
lady in the Lyceum piece was locked up in a room " for one night
only " with the namby-pamby M ichael, so in this Haymarket play
the principal heroine, Jane Nanglc, is out all night with her
lover, George Langton, and the other heroine. Constantia Gaze,
contrives to be placed in a similar predicament with Lord Bap-
child, on whom she haa matrimonial designs; and everything
having been explained to the satisfaction of the other dra-
matis persona who have not been out all night with any-
body, the piece concludes, as it had proceeded, without causing
any demonstration of that interest with which the story of The
Liars was closely followed by an attentive audience, whose en-
thusiasm increased with the development of the really ingenious
plot. When the curtain descended on. The Liars, its author was
acclaimed as a SHERIDAN Minor, or, say, Minimus.
The piece at the Hay market is, as Touchstone said of the knight's
oath, nought, but the acting is everything ;and, merely to see what
good acting can do for a poor piece, the Haymarket entertainment
is well worth a visit. There is scarcely an indifferent rendering
of any character throughout; but not all the fascinating art of a
WINIFRED EMERY can win the svmpathy of an audience for such
a wilful, childish, petulant, and far from high-principled "piece
of goods," as is Jane Nangle. Do what Miss EMERY can with
her, the part is unsympathetic and irritating.
As for Constantla Gaze (no connection, of course, with the
tourist agency), capitally played by Miss GERTRUDE KINGSTON,
she is a mild adventuress, and again quite unsympathetic.
Mr. CYTUL MAUDE is simply admirable as a sort of Verdant Green
young nobleman, a figure pour Tire, a character so farcical that
it might easily have been developed into an entirely new species
of the genus Dundreary, had such a genuine happy thought as
this opportunely occurred to the author. Be it remembered, how-
ever, that Dundreary grew out of The American Covxin, which
subsequently had an existence entirely apart from that of Lord
Dundreary. "The Manoeuvres of Lord Bapchild" (a name as
foolish as Dundreary) would have had a far better chance than
those of Jane. The scene in the third act between Mr.CYRiL MAUDE
and Miss KINGSTON goes with a roar of merriment from begin-
ning to end, the curtain being raised three times for actor and
actress to receive the plaudits of a delighted audience. This
episode will be invaluable hereafter as a most attractive duologue
at "benefit" performances. Here, given the two characters,
the situation, and the stage entirely to themselves, Mr. CYRIL
MAUDE ard Miss KINGSTON could easily have invented their own
dialogue at rehearsal, and then the scene might perhaps have
been even better than it is; but, aa it is, it is undeniably the
success of the evening's entertainment.
Miss ROSE LECLERCQ, with all her cleverness, can do very little
with the dull role assigned to her; and Pamela Beechinor (what
namea H. A. J. selects!), a most objectionable girl, whose ob-
trusive existence does not seem to be essential to the plot, is
remarkably well played by Miss BEATRICE FERRAR. Her being
"taken and shaken" by Jane is the strongest action in Miss
EMERY'S part. Admirably does she do it, and marvellously does
Miss FERRAR whimper and bear it.
Mr. FREDERICK HARBISON, as a sort of gentlemanly chorus
called Jervis Punshon (here's another name!), is as good as
he can be with absolutely nothing whatever to do; and so
is Mr. HALLARD as George Langton, the lover. As Nangle,
which is, we believe, a peculiarly Irish name, and waa somehow
mixed up with the TICHBORNE case, Mr. ELLIOT has the
best "character part" in the piece, simply because there is no-
thing novel in it, his characteristics being merely a slight variant
of the peppery old fathers in ancient farces, who went about either
cursing some one or blessing everybody, and who, in the end,
on being patted on the cheek by the pretty daughter, invariably
yielded, cave consent, and said, "Take her, you dog,—be happy."
Such is the Jonesian originality!
Besides these, there are thirteen other characters, all conscien-
tiously doing their little bits, and the whole lot of them just worth
nothing at all dramatically. It has not yet been given to JONES
to originate another Le Monde ou I'on s'ennuie, though he does
rush in where only a very, very few, and those mainly
French dramatists, can treal with safety. All that stage craft
can do for the piece has been done in acting, scenery, and cos-
tumes, and if the character, as we have suggested, could be
Dundrearyized, Mr. CYRIL MAUDE might look forward to a run
equal to that enjoyed by the representative of the once famous
nobleman.
HALL v. HOOLET.— A propns of a statement made by Mr.
TERAH BOOM-DE-AY HOOLET, Sir CHARLES HALL, Recorder of
London, and HALL of Justice, wrote to the Times to deny that
he is, was, or ever has been, what Mr. HOOLEY had asserted him
to be, or to have been. HALL right. Good. Proudly conscious
of his unique personality, Sir CHARLES HALL wrote, "as I am the
only person of that name," therefore, &c., &c. Of course.
"Charles, our friend," the only person of that name, and no
other genuine! Colourable imitations there may be ; likewise per-
sons asserting that they are "HALL the same concern," which is
a most " untradesmanlike falsehood " ; but CHARLEY is our darling,
our gay cavalier, our only HALL, and not to be Haul'd over the
coals, and to be blackened in the process by a Hooley-gan ! Jamais
de la vie! Why French? Don't know; but 'tis emphatic.
"How dost thou, Charles?" to quote SHAKSPEAKE'S As You
Like it. Then comes the answer, "He cannot speak, my lord!"
Oh, WILLY SHAKSPEARE! you are in error there! Can't he
"speak"! Rather! and he can tell the HOOLEY that he is
HOOLEY and entirely wrong.
NOTE BY THE BARON DE B.-W.—From the same publishing
firm of KEGAN, PAUL & Co. (with a lot of "Co." limited), are
issued The Silence of Dean Maitland and a volume of Sermons.
We, personally, should prefer the "Silence." Also is advertised
A New Light on Hebrew Hi-story, by Professor CORNILL. Was
this work originally written for the Corn'ill Maga-.inef Of
course it will be very witty, full of ban Mo' and Jews d'csprit.

THE SULTAN AND THE TRAVELLER.
AN EASTERN TALB.
THB SULTAN and the Traveller
So cordially met,
But wept like anything to see
Such quantities of debt.
"The moans to clear this off," they said,
"It would be nice to get."
"If seven banks with seven. loans
Tried it for half a year,
Do you suppose," the SULTAN said,
"That they could get it clear?"
"I doubt it," said the Traveller,
And shed a bitter tear.
"O Moslems, come and look at us!"
The SULTAN blandly bade.
"A Giaour guest, come from the West,
To push Teutonic trade;
For that new palace, built for him,
You very kindly paid."
The SULTAN and the Traveller
The capital had seen,
With streets so nicely paved, and washed
Conveniently clean;
And all the placid Moslems stood,
Like fatalists, serene.
"The time has come," the SULTAN said,
"To talk of many things;
Of shoes that pinch, of costly stones,
Of Cretan chiefs, and kings,
And railways made in Germany,
And whether pounds have wings."
"But wait a bit," the Moslems cried,
"Before we have our chat;
For all of us are out of cash,
Squeezed, like a lemon, flat."
"No hurry," said the Traveller.
They thanked him much for that.
"A loan of gold," the SULTAN said,
"Is what we chiefly need',
Rubies and diamonds besides
Are very good indeed;
Now if you *re ready, Moslems dear,
We 're waiting to be fee'd."
"But not by us," the Moslems cried,
Turning a little blue,
"We 've been compelled to wash our homes,
A painful thing to do I"
"They look so fine," the SULTAN said,
"And much improve the view."
"It was so kind of you to come,
And leave domestic ease."
The Traveller said nothing but,
"One more concession, please;
We want a larger profit than
We get from German Threes."
"Von don't object," the SULTAN asked,
"To join in such a trick?
We 've nattered you for all we're worth,
And said you are a brick."
The Traveller said nothing but,
"The butter's spread too thick."
"I weep for you," the SULTAN said,
"I deeply sympathise;
An ornament in diamonds—
Those of the largest size—
A sabre, jewels, furniture,
My modest gifts comprise."
"O Moslems," said the Traveller.
"You 've all been nicely done!
So I '11 be trotting off again."
But answer came there none;
And this was scarcely odd, because
They 'd hooleyed every one.

DARBY JONES ON "BOTTLERS" AND
LIVERPOOL.
WB have now arrived, honoured Sir, at
that Season of the Year when "Bottlers"
are meet in evidence. The word " Bottler"
will not, I opine, be found in the Lexicons
of either Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON, or of
Messrs. WEBSTER and WALKER. Indeed,
without having registered the mot at Sta-
tioners' Hall, Imay claim it as a poor thing,
but Mine Own. The "Bottler " is a pecu-
liar beast, and in nine cases out of ten He
(or She) belongs to a Trainer. He has gene-
rally been so well tried at home that he can
with safety be relied on to slip the Autumn
Handicapper's Observant Optics, and be
comfortably weighted at an Impost which
shall be as easy to carry as an ounce or
two of Thistle-down. Occasionally the
"Bottler" has run in the Early Spring,
before he recognised that he possessed four
legs, but he has scarcely ever won. In-
deed, it is greatly to the credit of the
"Bottler" that as a rule he never seeks
victory in these Preliminary Exercises, and
if he be misguided enough to attempt a
Coup on his own account, he is speedily
reminded that his Education is far from
complete.
The " Bottler" is the Terror of the Tip-
ster. Training Reports anent "Bottlers"
are about as valuable as the Gamboge-
coloured Volumes issued by the French
Government on the subject «f Fashoda and
other Freaks on the Nile. And as Captain
KRITERION very justly remarks, even if you
are in the "knew" of one ''Bottler," an-
other "Bottler" comes along and spells
"no " in quite a different inanner.
So beware of "Bottlers" in the Back-
end, especially at Liverpool, where the
"canny men of the North serve them up
as hot as do Ladies of tihe same region
Pikelets and other indigestible Cakee at
Tea-time. It will puzzle many an Intrepid
Plunger to know how he is going to come
up on the Monday following the IV. Days
of Contest; but while begging you, hon-
oured Sir, and other Patrons, to remember
that the Good-win Sands are as much in
evidence round about the Mersey as they
are off the Coast of Kent, I may ask
remembrance of Marmion's last words
throughout tie meeting, and also crave,
in special reference to the Liverpudlian
Cup, some hearing for the rhymes of a
Bewildered Bard, who sings: —
The Heated One I 'd leave alone,
But I*t her Go beware;
The Old Sign needs a better tone
To iii.ikr the See-haw care;
The Timber Down will Dot be last,
Kitty's Envoy runs for me;
And if Perfeetiona 's passed,
'Twill be by Castle B.

THE LOST AET.

his impression" in the Severity Independent:—
'Dancing has developed into an exercise
little better than a "romp ;the art seems lopf •

Between the ball-room and the football field there
seems little now to choose; the riik of injury is, I
think, rather greater in the former.'"
Watmintter Gazttte.]
ALAS! how many things I see
No longer what they used to be 1
What changes wrought by Time's fell curse,
And every one of them for worse;
And sipping my post-prandial chicory,
I mourn, alas, our lost Terpsichore!
Oh! for the days when there were dancers!
Oh! for the mazes of the Lancers t
With what a nimble step elastic
We tripped it on the light fantastic,
With a sweet charm which now is not,
Through gay cotillion or gavotte,
Or with a grace more regal yet,
We stepped a stately minuet,
Each man of us a choice assortment
Of Turveydropian deportment.
But where is now your ancient pomp?
Your dance is but a vulgar romp,
Your shocking "Barns " and " Posts "—oh,
fie!
You only think of kicking high.
The men career sans time, sans rhythm,
The girls rush helter-skelter with 'em,
They charge, they trample on one's toes,
Their elbows hit one on the nose,
They black one's eyes, still on they come,
They butt one in the back and stum—
I mean the waistcoat, till the hall
Is more like battlefield than ball.
I 'd rather serve in the Soudan,
I 'd rather fight at Omdurman,
I 'd rather quarrel with a chum,
I 'd rather face a Rugby scrum,
Nay, by the stars, I 'd rather be
That hapless wretch, the referee,
Most desperate of men, than chance
My life and limbs at modern dance.

MISCONSTRUCTION.
f" Some rebellious murmurs have lately been heard against the quaint and
pleasing practice of printing the menu in French."—The IForld.]
OH, democratic leveller, who do not even shrink
From turning into English Ollendorffish MAETERLINCK,
Spare yet this further step! nor let your ruthless fingers itch
To tear aside the mask that veils the viands of the rich,
The card that hides grim secrete from a too inquiring view
In merciful obscurity—the mispronounced menu.
Purges we taste and question not, we count it inexpedient
To set down in plain English each mysterious ingredient;
The rather homely sweet-bread sounds quite dignified, you
know,
When served (and priced accordingly) as dainty ris de veau,
And he who pays in ignorance of what hnn d'cuuvres mean,
Might grudge a modest shilling for an oyster or sardine.
Sheer gammon and plain spinach seem more appetising far
If gallicised to jambnn and disguised as epinard;
Let English beef still decorate its wholesome lean and fat
In semblance of filet de bcevf, dressed a (a this and that,
And honest " Murphies" swell with pride and satisfaction when
Writ large as Maitre d'Hdtel, fandantes, or Pomme Parisienne.
Thus heralded and introduced there 's nothing comes amiss,
Hunger has neither eyes nor ears, and ignorance is bliss;
Let us from some unknown Chateau our wry-faced claret sip,
Then pay our monstrous bill, and add the garfnn's heavy tip,
But—no translation! for in truth no restaurant would dare
Describe its thieving menu as an honest Bill of Fare.

THE DAY'S TALK.
(7n Humble Imitation </RuDYARD KIPLING.)
A MOTOR-CAR came sailing down the
Strand, piffing and sniffing with each ex-
§losion of the petroleum by which she was
riven. Her name was .000000007. Why
she was called .000000007 is not apparent,
but she was.
Her speed was twelve knots an hour—
she was nothing if not technical—and her
smell was prodigious. So were her con-
versational powers. "Hullo!" she cried,
waving her hand to a bicycle which shied
visibly at her annroach and held its nose.
"How do you find yourself?"
"None the better for seeing you," said
the bicycle. It was a Humber (first grade),
and therefore haughty.
"Needn't give yourself airs," hissed the
irotor-car. derisively. "You ain't an Els-
wick, you know." For there is a hierarchy
in bicvcles as in other things, and the
attitude of an Elswick to a Humber is that
of nn archdeacon to a mere curate.
The bicycle deigned no reply, but rang
its bell angrily as a 'bus bore down upon
it.
"Conceited creature!" said the 'bus,
shaving its off pedal by an inch.
"Clumsy brute!" rang out the bell, in
shrill tones.
"Toot, toot," protested the motor-car,
far in the distance, as it sped jolting and
rattling towards Charing Cross, every
square inch of its person vibrating with
self-importance as it fussed through the
traffic.
"I wish you wouldn't jerk so," said the
piston-rod to the cylinder, sulkily.
"What else can you expect?" said the
brake, who was a malcontent. He had had
a difference of opinion with the cylinder
only that morning.
<fYah!" said the cylinder. "You want
oiling."
The motor-car drew up suddenly with a
jerk.
"What's the matter now?" grunted the
axle.
"Policeman in the way," hissed the cy-
linder. "Phut, phut, phut."
"If you go on making that noise we shall
burst," said the pneumatic tyres, crossly.
"Our nerves won't stand it."
"Silence is golden, you know," sneered
the brake.
"And noise is always vulgar," said the
cushion on the driver's seat. He had pre-
tensions to good breeding, and despised the
motor-ens^ne as a parvenu. He had
formerly belonged to a two-horsed victoria,
and constantly alluded to the fact.
"You have no repose of manner, my
dear," added the seat, patronisingly. He
always agreed with the cushion, and was
wont to sigh for postilions and the old
regime.
"Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh!" an-
swered the motor, as the policeman at
length moved aside, and left the passage
clear.
"What rot all this is I " sighed the driver
of the motor-car. "I wish to goodness
you machines wouldn't talk so much."
"Blockhead1" muttered the cushion,
stirring angrily in his seat.
"Stupid!" hissed the cvlinder.
"If you don't shut up, I'll sell you,"
snapped the man, savagely.
Suddenly there was a crash, a jarring of
crumpled machinery, the boom of an explo-
sion, and a flash of fire, as the motor-car
collided with a brewer's dray, and blew up,
like a melinite shell. .000000007 was dis-
integrated. Cylinder went one way,
wheels another, pneumatic tyres a third
while in the road sat the driver surrounded
by picturesque ruin in flnmes.
"Told you so," growled the dray ; while
the horse burst into song:
"Oh! KIPIING mine, where are YOU roaming?"
And so, in a babel of highly technical
conversation from axles, wheels, hubs,
brakes, horses, asses, lamp-posts, letter-
boxes, and the rest, the Day's Talk went
on, amid the smrcely concealed yawns of
thj reading public.

(En souhaitaitt le bonjour d M. It Eidactcur-

DEAR SIR,-—I wish to point a moral.
Last week I showed in serious vein
How gentle words may square a quarrel
And save a lot of needless pain;
I rather hoped for some reply
Saying that this had caught your eye.
I hinted—here I 'm roughly quoting—
That France was touchy in the skin,
That she possessed an outer coating
So soft, go sensitively thin,
That, when a homely truth is stated,
She finds her honour perforated.
But those whose native habits lead 'em
To live in structures built of glass
Should not indulge with any freedom
In heaving stones when people pans,
Because, when people heave them back,
Conservatories often crack.
Now note with what unique urbanity
Your journals judge our conduct here;
Not such as make for mere insanity—
The gamin'* rage, the rag pour rirp,
But prints like yours, whose pride it is
To educate the provinces.

From that enlightened organ's page
That we it was who lately lathered
Your strikers into frenzied rage;
The same old story, O so old,
Of virtue bribed by British gold!
Concealed behind our sombre climate,
With every means for lying low,
It seems that »v were all the time at
The bottom of the bordereau,
Our object being, in a word,
To make your army look absurd!
And who for some ulterior reason
Made full arrangements for the Turk
To vegetate in bloated ease on
Armenia's grave, his gruesome work?
If one may credit your suggestion
We were the horrid brutes in question.
And when the English missionary
Was missed among the pagan blacks,
Pray, who suborned the cassowary
That fell upon his harmless tracks?
We did! It happened through our nation
Being so keen on compensation.
All that is cunning, base, perfidious,
In beery Albion has its birth;
She still must be the blot, the hideous
Blister that blights the crust of Earth,
Until her race retires to bed on
The gory field of Armageddon.
Such is your day-by-day consignment
Of eye-awakeners for the blind;
Such is the tone of true refinement
To which you raise the rural mind;
While we are straining to abolish
All speech that lacks the pure French polish.
Mon Die.u! you used to send as over
Manners to fit your fashion's code,
What time the Empire lived in clover
And Paris set the social mode!
At all the graces once so deft,
You surely have some humour left?

A FALLEN ASS.
Indignant Gillie (to Jones, of London, who has by mistake killed a hind). "I THOUGHT ONT,

(From one Ancient Etonian to another ditto.)
Oh I POSTHUMUS, or BROWN, or SMITH, or
JONES,
The stream u ever flowing to the sea.
Gout and rheumatic pains attaint the bones
And sinews of our middle age, and we
Are on the downward grade. But let us
pause,
And from remembrance cull the hours o:
yore,
The hours of "private," disregard of laws,
Immunity from trouble—leas or more.
Do you remember how we used to row,
To "Monkey" in an "after four" and
back,
Or Surly—which? I really do not know,
But Surly has an air of being slack.
Do you remember how. as "lower boys,"
Our souls delighted in all kinds ol
"sock"?
That was our word for grub's plebeian joys?
Old men forget, and young Etonians
mock.
Or how our daily pleasure was to shirk
"Mitutor" and nis worthy pupil-room?
Much better "at the wall" to go and
"firk,"
Forgetting "Tardy Book's" Bradleian
gloom.
Dear was our Eton, dear it was to play
The constant fool, both in and out of
place—
I, POSTHUMUS, am getting rather grey,
While bald's the word more fitted to
your case.
Yet, though senescence makes its gradual
way,
And we are sweets forbid, and beer, and
cheese,
Of this I'm sure—there'll never come a
day
When memories of Eton fail to please.
A Romantic Investment.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I venture to suggest
that M. DE ROUGEMONT and Mr. E. T.
HOOLET should be syndicated under the
title of the International United Fiction
Company (Unlimited). What say you?
Your obedient servant,
BARTHOLOMEW BUSTER.
Angel Court, E.G.
PERFIDIOUS GAUL.
THE Petit Journal of the 1st inst. showed, in a leading article,
how the English—who had conferred on the SIRDAR "le titre
de lord de Khartoum "—had pursued the scheme of an Empire
:rom the Cape to Cairo, which would form a reserve continent,
should the Russians expel them from Asia. The system is simply
hat of causing various domestic troubles in any opposing country.
As regards France, for instance, "Us lui out suscite I'affaire
DREYFUS, sans parler des annexes, une grew qui a eehoue, mais
qui promettait d'abord beaucoup plus, puis I'agitation d'un spectre
leiiwdc, le complot militaire."
We have no doubt whatever that these facts, or statements,
;f our very esteemed contemporary are worthy of all respect.
)n the other hand, we have equally strong proof that the French
caused,—
1. The mud in London last week. The clouds, from which the
rain fell, were blown by a southerly wind from France.
2. The cold, dry winds of 'last Spring and every Spring. The
pxcitability of the French causes their warmed air to rise, and
hen the cold air from the North Pole rushes over us.
3. The HOOLEY case. We do not quite know how they caused
his, but many things are being revealed.
4. The matinee hat.
5. "The Fifth." That spectre demode, the Gunpowder Plot.
It is reported that on Saturday last some very suspicious cha-
racters were observed, not only at Harwich, but in many English
towns. They were in various disguises, and most of them were
conducted nlwut. by poor English boys and men, in whom poverty
had unhappily extinguished patriotism. Can it be doubted that
these disguised persons were French spies? In the evening
many loud explosions were heard, and the worst was feared, even
where, as at Harwich, the dry powder is kept in a secret place.
6. The increase of indigestion in England. This is an especially
perfidious attempt to undermine the British constitution. Sturdy
Englishmen, who formerly fed on honest sirloin of beef and plain
leg of mutton, can get nothing now but aloyau roti and gigot de
pre sale.
7. The accident to the Prince of WALES, from which he has
now happily recovered. This is our last accusation, and it en-
tirely eclipses all those made by the Petit Journal. There is
very little doubt that the Prince slipped on some French polish.
"Wios ON THE GREEN."—An example of this saying may be
seen any day in the Courts of Justice, when several youthful and
inexperienced barristers appear for the first time in their full
forensic costume.

First G. Why, you. Your name s Gog as sure as mine is

Second G. Right you are 1 And there's nothing about oui
being Gog and Magog in London and its Environs. But let that
pass. W hat do you want?
First G. Only to remind you that we have reached Lord
Mayor's Day and the Annual Banquet.
Second G. Couldn't very well forget it, with all the prepara-
tions going on! W hat a heap they do eat, to be sure.
First G. Not surprising, after meandering about in a show from
twelve till five. Have you heard what it's like this year? You
ought to know, as you are such a reader.
Second G. Oh, the same kind of thing as per usual. Bands,
banners and beadles. Triumphal cars and fire-engines.
First G. I wonder they don't give us an airing now and again.
Second G. Much kinder to leave us where we are. Besides, if
they once carried us about the streets they would change our

to-night.
Second G. Just as well, as we shall have plenty of serious talk

to the rule.
Second G. Not likely to leave "common form." Navy ready

First G. Yes, I suppose that will be about the size of it. Well,
the place looks very well.
Second G. Yes, but it's a pity that one of the features de-
scribed in London and its Environs is absent. I mean that re-
markable collection of silk that used to hang to the walls a
hundred and thirty-seven years ago.
First G. You mean the standards and colours taken from the
French at the battle of Ramillies. Oh, we don't want a re-
minder of that sort at present.
Second G. Well, I suppose not, especially as we have the ad-
vantage of the daily papers.
First G. Quite so, brother. "We don't want to fight, but"

THE W7ARRIOR'S DIARY.
Monday.—Pleasant breakfast to meet distinguished citizens.
Three lunches, where 1 hearti'ly enjoyed myself. Such different
fare to rations on service. Customary dinner. Turtle-soup
as good as ever.
Tuesday.—Four breakfasts, a couple of luncheons, dinner,
supper. Obliged to show appreciation of all mea'ls.
Wednesday.—Much the same as before. Turtle becoming
slightly monotonous. However, if people wish to be hospitable,
I must be appreciative.
Thursday.—I am afraid I am overdoing it. But can't get out
of it. Invitations pour in by the hundred. Can't refuse them all 1
Friday.—Dear me I it's simply dreadful. Four breakfasts, five
luncheons, and half-a-dozen dinners. This is going beyond a joke!
Saturday.—Misery! What I might have expected. Sum-

Act I.— Ante-room. First Lancers.
Local colouring. Soldiers in uniform.
Chap on duty wears belt. Necessary ladies
at large. Dean for comic relief. RANKER,
VC, very redolent of the Sergeants' Mess.
Wants to be gentleman. Saved conscien-
tious chap's life. Conscientious chap won't
take any more of his cousin's money.
Cousin lady of title. Money gone to send
conscientious chap to Eton. RANKER,
VC, told to be " genial." Bores every one
to have a drink. Dean angry. Ladies at
large affronted. Colonel furious. Cham-
pagne produced. Lady of title saves situa-
tion by drinking RANKER, VC's very good
health. [Curtain.
Act II.— Year later. Country house
with good shooting in the front garden.
Local colouring. Two pops—right and left
barrels. Realistic gamekeeper. Real tip.
HANKER, VC, improved. No more sug-
gestion of free drinks. Conscientious chap
in a mess. Sprained his ankle and lost
£9,000 to a millionaire. Can't pay. Con-
sequently must exchange into West India
regiment and be ruined. Lady of title
appeals to RANKER, VC. Gong for dinner.
Usual evening dress. RANKER, VC, snubs
millionaire, and leads lady of title to the
banquet. [Curtain.
Act III.—Ball. Band playing MOL-
LOY'B "Last Waltz." RANKER, VC,
"gone" on lady of title. Ex-conscientious
chap describes his shame. Cousin agrees
that he must be ruined. Doesn't occur to
her that she might pay the £9,000 (see Act
II.) herself. Or if it does, she doesn't men-
tion the notion to a third party. RANKER,
VC, beards the millionaire. Remembers
him as a race-course tout. Identifies him
by absence of fingers and tattoo marks on
his chest. Makes millionaire give up pro-
missory notes. Millionaire angry. Says
it's " an awkward thing to make a deadly
foe of a chap with two millions of money."
Millionaire probably right. Lady of title
kisses now rehabilitated conscientious chap.
She blesses RANKER, VC. Everybody
blesses RANKER, VC. RANKER, VC, re-
turns compliment and blesses everybody.
Then says he '11 go (via the War Office) to

taking all things into consideration, the

chap, but more at his ease amongst tigers

he goes, Jeaving behind him—curtain.

Diamond-cut-Diamond scene between RAN-
KER, VC, and millionaire tout suggestive
of somewhat similar situation in Still

probably will) give it a chance of pulling

'TWAS the voice of the SIRDAR,

"They won't have any pity;
I must eat again.
I am up all the night,
And I 'm longing for bed,
No rest for a lion
Who's always being fed.

MOURNFUL NUMBERS.
(From Mr. Punch's Vagrant Contributor.)
DEAK SIR,—They tell me life is but a
dream ; things, so it seems, are rarely what
they seem; JONES, whose substantial form is
known so well in Piccadilly, Regent Street,
Pall Mall; who, posed amidst a group
of nine or ten, lays down the law to listen-
ing, lesser men, who, lest the fates should
ever make him thinner, consumes vast
herds of beeves at lunch and dinner, rates
in loud tones, while I sit looking on, the
shrinking waiters at the "Mastodon," and
thence retiring to his ample bed, shakes
the firm pavements with his massive tread
—this mass of platitudinous verbosity, this
sixteen btone of self-assured pomposity,
this JONES, in fact, so stout, so loud, so
tall, is merely a phenomenon—that's all.
If JONES is but the shadow of a name,
it strikes me other things may be the same.
There 's the moustache, for instance (ends
quite flat, shaped like a well-tied butterfly
cravat), which, as the gaping world of
Moslems knows, sprouts beneath WIL-
HELH'S most Imperial nose, those angry
bristles with defiant tips, meet cornice for
the wearer's spouting lips, that fine, fierce
fringe of coruscating hair, tended with all
a mother's watchful care, which (if such
growths can be supposed to hear) hears—
(blessed moustache !)—each wild Wilhelmian
cheer, what time the KAISER, a convivial
soul, lifts to some royal host his brimming
bowl, and, girthed and buttoned till he's
fairly bursting, shouts, "Hoch! hoch!!
hnch!!!" while all the rest are thirsting,
which being done he dashes off anew, writes
a new drama, sees a fresh review, or, while
the trumpets sound ta-ran-ta-ra, unveils a
statue to his grandpapa. That Schnurr-
bart, with its fiery ends a-kimbo, must go
with much I love beside to limbo, since
this conclusion cannot be resisted—it don't
exist and never has existed.
Then Egypt—I propose to have the face
to doubt if there is really such a place:
Egypt whereat tho French, they say, look
glum, is a land renowned in fable for its
mummies, where, from the Pyramids' as-
piring crown, some forty centuries keep
looking down, where the great Nile arisini
in its flood blesses the festive fellaheen witL
mud, where the gay crocodile deposits eggs
or snips far lunch some Arab swimmer's
legs, where FLINDERS PETRIE, with pecu
liar zest, finds in each royal tomb a palimp-
sest, and where, while ages roll, the im-
passive Sphinx sits in the sand and thinks,
and thinks, and thinks. This land, de-
signed for British skill and pith, is, I pro-
test, a most egregious myth. Each day

LottffT (looking at a hundred pound, dressing-bag). "I WONDER WOT SORT OF A BLOKE IT
IS AS WANTS A BACS OK Tool.* I.IKE THAT TO POSS 'iSSJSLF VI* WITH?"
I find myself believing less that we can
occupy and not possess, that even British
courage can affect to guard a country which
it mayn't protect, and that a nation which
is not a fool can govern things, and yet let
others rule.
WThy is this thusness, why are things so
mixed, since (see Cartoon) JOHN BULL is
firmly fixed? On points like this, dear
Punch, I pray you may grant some light
and leading to Your puzzled

[" Early next year the man who haa a ponny to

realise at his convenience."—Daily Mail.}
THE penny-in-the-slot machine
Up to the present time has been
A method whereby one might get
A match, cigar, or cigarette;
Or juveniles might satiate
Their appetites with chocolate;
Or little snobs on conquest bent
Deodorise themselves with scent.
But now there is a scheme afloat,
Of which economists take note,
To save up for a rainy day
The penny which was thrown away.
No longer shall we purchase sweets,
But for our coppers get receipts:
And thrifty people hail with thanks
The advent of these penny banks.

SEATS OF THE MIGHTY."

IT IS REPORTED FKOM THE SHIRES, THAT HOME OP THE FlKST FLIGHT ARE THINKING OF ADOPTING THE "ToD SLOAN
SEAT" FOR HUNTING.
SNAPSHOTS FROM THE EAST.
Cairo, October 24.
HONOURED SHEIKH PUNCH (upon whom be peace, whose efful-
gence is as the Full Moon!), may thy unworthy messenger send
thee this writing left in the Esbekieh Garden here by some dog
of a Frank? Perchance he is one of the infidel Giaours who are
journeying with one LUNN EFFENDI into Syria after the Sheikh
of Alemanniya. Thy servant, Ali Ben Zaiq, kisseth thy hunip
and right big toe. May thy day be blessed!
I. Arrive at Alexandria from Marseilles, via Genoa and Naples,
with large contingent of Teutons. When they foregather in the
smoking-room, the row is kolos.ial, as every one tries to shout
down the others. As far as I can discover, their conversation
consists of gar nichts and gar latin. However, we fraternize over
deck quoits and "beanbags." Our ship's crest is an ancient
Greek galley, with six elderly gentlemen rowing for a good deal
more than they are worth, and the motto is the famous phrase of
PERICLES, "philokalownen met' euteleias," that is, we cultivate
the beautiful on the coupon system. We land, after pleasant
voyage, at sunset. One second after so doing, hear the cry—
bakhshish. It has not stopped since. A special train brings us
to Cairo, and dinner at midnight.
II. First day's sight-seeing in Cairo. Start with the Mosque
of Sultan HASSAN. Have initial difficulty with slippers, which
must be put on over boots. As these are about number twenty-
five in size, it requires very considerable dexterity to keep them
on. Am obliged to trail mine behind. Hope this act of desecra-
tion will not oome to the ear of the CALIPH. Our guide, IBRAHIM
OSMAN, has a stentorian voice and a fund of humour, as when he
tells as that MOHAMMED ALI gave Mamelukes "jolly good hiding,"
but EMIN "hooked it," and recites "Home, sweet home" when
hf has finished with us for the day. On to more mosques and
citadel, where we see TOMMY ATKINS trying to keep warm (with
temperature over ninety degrees in the shade) by playing foot-

Bedouins apiece, who haul us up to the summit, where, like
NAPOLEON'S forty centuries, we look down on the Ni'e in flood,
the Sphinx, and other well-established land-marks. Try to rise
to the occasion, but come down sitting. Then clamber down and
slide on all fours (face uppermost) into interior. At finish, guides
inquire, "How you feel?" and "Hope you satsified," and we
make entry to that effect in note-book of MOUSSA FAID, the
Sheikh of the Pyramid. Then (on camel-back) to interview
Sphinx, who receives us with its usual bland smile, as who should
say, " Wait till you have been taken right through the Museum,
my dears, and then we '11 see who has the laugh last!" The
Sphinx has it, I think, not being an Egyptologist. Still, glad
to meet RAMESES II., who, as IBRAHIM says, was the father of
seventy-two sons, sixty-nine being boys and three girls. Also,

poem by CLEMENT SCOTT, illustrated by a clever somebody whose
name—miralrile dictit !—is not on the drawing, entitled "Waterloo
and Omdurman." This warlike illustrated annual might well
have been dedicated to "Warre's Boys at Eton," among whom
no doubt it will be very popular. We trust that the circulation
of Editor LATEY'S papar may be " Late et longe."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PROCESS OF EXHAUSTION.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Of all artistic volumes on purely artistic subjects, commend the
Baron to that of the Magazine of Art for 1898, CASSELL & Co. One
of the two colour-plates, called The Offering, Sir EDWARD POYNTER,
P.R.A., a water-colour, might have been with advantage omitted.
The other, St. Cæcilia, from the painting by GEO. HITCHCOCK, is
better, but not entirely satisfactory. On the other hand, all the
photogravures are excellent; and among them the reproduction
of A Belle of Saville, by BURGESS, R.A., takes the first place, that
is, in the Baron's humble opinion. A “Memorial Sketch” of
that dashing cavalier artist, brave Sir JOHN GILBERT, R.A.,
P.R.W.S., is most interesting, and especially so to the Baron, on
account of its containing Sir John's frontispiece designed for
Mr. Punch in 1843. Among several able articles contributed by
Mr. M. H. SPIELMANN is one on JULES CHÉRET, “the Poster
King,” as just as it is generous. In the article on “Masks
among Greeks and Barbarians," there is a Grecian terra-cotta
Mask of Tragedy, which bears a weird resemblance to a certain
full-face portrait of WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY, by LAW-
RENCE, that is, if the Baron's memory serves him well. Alto-
gether, the present volume, for 1898, of the Magazine of Art is
certainly “one of the very bost” of Messrs. CASSELL'S many
ventures.
The third volume completing The Annals of a Publishing House
(BLACKWOOD) suffers by comparison with its predecessors from
an inevitable cause. With few exceptions, the earlier years of
the life of an eminent man or a great firm are the most interest-
ing. It is the period of storm and stress, when character is being
formed, and everything has to be won by hard fighting. As
soon as a man waxes fat and kicks, my Baronite finds him suffer-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.

WARNING TO CYCLISTS.
AWFUL DISCOVERY MADE BY JONES ON THE MORNING OF THE OPENING MEET, THAT
THROUGH DEVOTION TO CYCLING, HIS CALVES HAD DEVELOPED FAR BEYOND THE CAPACITY
OF HIS BOOTS.
DARBY JONES LEAVES LIVERPOOL
FOR DERBY.
LIVERPOOL, I believe, derives its name
from a weird waterfowl (not owned by
Captain GREEH)J and on my communi-
cating the fact to the Count, who is still
on the look-out for Continental Exports,
he ordered a dish of them for dinner. Alas
the Liverpudlian Bird must be as extinct
as the Proverbial Dodo, for he was served
with the ordinary produce of the Calf
accompanied by relishes of Pig's flesh. Yet
this Bird figures large on the Municipal
Shield, and would undoubtedly, in fine and
healthy condition, be highly acceptable tc
a well-known Fictionist, Poet and Sunday
Gossip, who recently, by his own account,
dined off " a soul with shrimp sauce." He
will be devouring a Ghost stuffed with
truffles next! Why not a real Liver?
Let me turn to more practical matters.
Just as Knowsley, with its reminiscences
of the Ancient Monarchs of the Isle of Man
and the Progenitors of Mr. HALL CAJNE,
is the mainstay of the Liverpool gathering,
so is Chatsworth, embellished with the
Relics and Tomb of Sir JOSEPH PAXTON,
the Chief Support of Derby. The City
and I pronounce our names after the same
Classical Mode, but spell it differently.
Filled with Timorous Apprehension, that
Dread with which even the most Argus-
eyed Vates fears the Fatal Pen, whose
scratching never tickles any Backer, I em-
bark into poesy anent the Cup associated
with the Midland Railway Metropolis, and
warble :—
For the Sky Saint I may not declare,
Hut the Cutrock may come to the fore;
Drove Zealous has no weight to spare,
And the *S'w» god ie forwa' d no more.
Look out for the " Colonel" and "Uuke,"
For their choices are sure to go near;
The Ditchtfeiglit may bring oft' a " fluke,"
But the High 6'u/H and Fairy I fear.
You may not be convinced, nor in truth,
honoured Sir, am I; but I am perhaps the
more inspired by the Right-feeling Spirit
of Prophecy, because I have just Fashodad
(to use the latest Bourse expression) a con-
siderable portion of one of those mighty
Slabs of Corned Ox for which Derby is so
justly celebrated. Trusting that the Ne-
cessary Reminder for the Prodigious Out-
lay to which I have been put may meet
with your Esteemed Approval of its Mode-
ration, I beg once more to subscribe myself,
your ever obedient slave, but not syco-
phant, DARBY JONES.
[D. J. has sent us in a wondrous bill, totally
disproportionate to his services. Apparently he
has lived on nothing but champagne, whiskey and
soda, and anchovy on toast ever since we were
rash enough to send him North. Our method of
dealing wiih his extravagance is simple.—ED.]
FLEET STREET AMENITIES.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—The Daily Chronicle has been casting re-
flections upon some remarks of my friend the German KAISEB,
now on tour. I therefore propose to stand outside the offices of
that journal and say "Deutschland iiber alles!" quite loud; also
to break the hats of the Editorial staff as it comes out. But I
should be glad to be assured that all expenses incurred in any
subsequent proceedings will reach me if subscribed by my ad-
mirers. Will you therefore kindly forward to my solicitors such
collected funds as may be sent to you for this excellent purpose?
I see that the Daily Chronicle has done a similar act of friendli-
ness to "a number of sympathisers with Dr. RUSSELL," a gentle-
man, you may remember, who obs3rved " Virr. la France!" at
*he ton of his void', and simultaneously collided with your
front-window. I gather from this precedent that I am not ask-
ing you to commit, a breach of inter-journalistic comity.
Yours heroically, GERMANICUS.

Solicitors come near me never,
And I reflect, amid my griefs,
Many are called, but few get briefs.
Of course? I hoped—but hopes will fail,
And now I 've learnt another tale,
That one may live and never know
Those bagmen whom we worship so,
Nor even greet with eager eyes
Those angels whom we so despise.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN DEFENCE OF CONVENTIONALITY.
"STIFF, formal, cramping, insincere
Convention freezes heart and mind,"
You said to me one day. I fear
Convention you have not maligned.
"On every hand she ladles out
Set smiles, set actions, and set phrases."
I know it all, yet I 'm about
To try and sing Convention's praises!
Consider! If for half a week,
Whate'er our sex, or age, or youth,
We only tried to act and speak
The simple plain unvarnished truth!
The truth would rob us, I 'm afraid,
Of friends, acquaintances, relations—
To designate a spade a spade
Alust always lead to complications.
Then do not let us always say
The thing we mean, or think, or see,
Nor let us lightly cast away
Convention's priceless formula.
Because we chance to have a heart,
What need upon our sleeve to wear it?
And why not put with artless art
The thing as people want to hear it?
That social gatherings like a dance
Were shams, you told me (in a waltz),
And every smile and word and glance
Exchanged at parties wholly false.
On principle I acquiesced,
To please you thus I sought right leally—
Although that dance. (perhaps you
guessed?)
Seemed somehow an exception, really!
Yet formula:, I say again,
Are blessings in whate'er disguise,
And save us hourly from the strain
Of some embarrassing surprise.
If conversation is absurd,
If parties are but sorry labours,
At least we know, in deed and word,
What to expect from all our neighbours.
Originality is "no go,"
Things into chaos would be hurled,
If we disturbed the status quo—
Convention saves the social world.
Towards the perfect state she tends,
FratertiiU, Liberte, and Egalite.—
Oh, tread the beaten track, my friends,
And "conspuez" Originality 1
Therefore, in spite of all you've said,
Society I but exhort
To bend the knee and bow the head
With me in Queen Convention's court.
And all the more I hail her Queen,
Since she—for this my verse has graced
her—
Makes friendship possible between
You, the Princess—and me, the
"Waster " 1

HONOURED SIR,—It were idle to conceal
from you that the Departure of J. TOD
SLOAN, Esquire, for the Land of the
Heaven-soaring Eagle has been hailed with
considerable delight, not only by our own
Native Knights of the Pigskin, but also by
a very large portion of the B. P. Not
because J. TOD S., Esquire, is not a very
Estimable Personage, but by reason of the
fact that, always having had the Pick of
our Horses during the Period in which he
honoured our little Rabbit-warren, he came
to be regarded as a Human Motorcar,
capable of driving the most Unreliable
Crocks to Victory, and forcing the Genteel
Pencillere to lay odds which ought, as
Captain K KITKRION truly remarks, to have
suffused the cheek of the most Weather
worn Speculator with the Rosy Tin
usually ascribed to the Gentle Maiden o
Seventeen Summers.
Far bo it from me to decry the Equin
Performances of this American Centaur
On the contrary, I consider that he ha.
done to Racing what the Australian
Cricketers did to" the Noble Game for th
enjoyment of which Lord's and the Ova
are still Oases in Modern Brickland, i.e.
he has made our Jockeys sit up while he

THE NEW GUV’NOR.
(To Prince George of Greece, with Mr. Punch's
best wishes.)
George! though the Powers may yet ar-
range,
For reasons too profound to mention,
At this conclusive point to change
The thing they call their fixed intention ;
Let neither this disturbing view,
Nor motives of domestic love, nor
The question why they go for you
Instead of some one else as Guv'nor,
Unman you. You have booked your bunk
Upon the friendly Tartar's vessel ;
Already with your weighty trunk
The stout Piræan porters wrestle ;
And now, before the nauseous main
Receives you, come! and, like a lamb, let
Such wisdom trickle through your brain
As fell from good Polonius (Hamlet).
Across the bit of azure brine
Where lately passed in easy splendour
The Gentleman from Palestine,
Our humble Faith's Superb Defender,
You sail to regions where the rose
Is badly wrapt about with briars,
To rule a race which “ One who knows"
Pronounced a set of sorry liars ;
And, since they found that time was saved
By living each upon his neighbour,
And consequently often waived
The dull formalities of labour,
He called them idle-bellied men ;
And doubtless still the island bristles
With just as smart a lot as when
The late St. Paul composed epistles.
For still, when short of other work,
The native goes and knifes his cousin,
The Christian being to the Turk
Even as six to half a dozen.
So, when you tread the devious ways
Of dark vendettas, you will please use
That tact for wriggling through a maze
Which marked the character of THESEUS.
Follow his steps, but not so near
As might imply an indiscretion ;
For there were things in his career
Which left behind a bad impression.
Attic, like you, and full of fun,
He drank, when dry, of famed Kephissus,
But ere his time in Crete was done,
He went and left his local missus !
But to return to Christian Crete:-

Reduced by some degrees of heat

The Jaffa railway ia great in scenery,

a few miles from Jerusalem, there was no

hours of waiting in a German Jiierhaus
harJ by the station. Still, when you are
in Jerusalem, you must do as the—Ger-
mans do, i.e., in this instance sit on a table
with a HP-Wit in one hand and a beer-jug
in thi other.
Embarking at Jaffa is exciting, in a
rough sea, at 1 A.M., or, indeed, at any
time. It is a good deal worse than Durban.
You are rowed out to the ship in surf-

After about twenty minutes' pitching and

and fall. In. the fearful chamois-leap you
take from the boat, all your past misdeeds
flash through your mind, and thoughts of
the old folks comfortably in bed at home,
the girl (or the luggage) you left behind
you, the sweet little cherub sitting up aloft,
the Bay of Biscay, Oh! Full Fathom Five,

OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
OF Christmas books my Baronitess writes:—Possibly owing to the
unprecedented success of a certain little girl's quaint drawings o
"Animal Land," there is a gigantic boom in the ways and doings o
ye bipeds and quadrupeds, Very little ones with a thirst for k now-
ledge of unnatural history, will discover much that is sympathetic
to their studies in The. Troubles of Tatters (BLACKIE AND SON), a
poor little waif of a dog with a string of tales by ALICE TALWIN
MORRIS, and illustrated by ALIPE B. WOODWARD. Ktorie* from
Lowly Life (MACMILLAN & Co.), by C. M. DUPPA, are full o
quiet, pleasurable interest, with pictures by Louis WAIN. Sybil'
Garden of Pleasant Beasts, by SYBIL and KATHARINE CORBET, is
an uncommonly lively spot, though not limited to a bear-garden
Evidently the animals in The Fables bti Fal, illustrated by Sir
PHILIP BuRNE-JoKES, have been attacked with that persisten
pessimism of fashionable decadence, and the grimness of tragedj
is suggested in these stories, especially in that of the "Wail of thf
Winkles." Both these bcoks are published by DUCKWORTH & Co
"It is all nonsense," declares the preface; but life would no
be worth living without its moments of nonsense, and MARY
KERNAHAN'S book is Nothing but Nonsense (JAMES BOWDEN), ant
very good it is. The pictures, by TONY LUDOVICI, are simply
beautifully ridiculous.
The Golliwogg at the Seaside (LONGMANS, GREEN & Co.), with
pictures by FLORENCE UPTON, and verses by BERTHA UPTON
will be thoroughly appreciated by the most youthful tripper who
has tasted the joys of holiday existence by the sad sea waves.
Dear little "Red Biding Hood " appears as fresh as ever, artisti-
cally re-dressed by WALTER CRANE, in her own Red Hiding
Hood's Picture Book (JOHN LANE), in company with several other
old favourites of fairy lore.
These are for the simple student of the nursery. The school-
boy's turn comes next, with his insatiable thirst to read of life as
he imagines it should be, one long realm of adventure and ro-
mance. In The Treasure Cave of the Blue Mowtt-iws (OLIPHANT,
ANDERSON, FERBIER), by OLIPHANT SMEATON, illustrated by
JOSEPH BROWN, this ideal is found in thrilling surroundings.
And again, in The Knight of the Golden Chain (ARTHUR PEARSON),
by E. D. CHETWODE, romance is insidiously welded with history,
a delicate method similar to that of giving powders in jam.
The utter fierceness of the two gentlemen on the cover of Draw
Swords, gives a fair notion of MANVILLE FEHN'S story, which
takes place in the early Victorian pre-examination days, when a
youthful soldier's existence was certainly then a very lively and

REMBRANDT—A STUDY.
(By One who loves Art and Economy.)
OH! the delight to hear that the richest
treasures of Dutch painting were to be
centred in Amsterdam! In a word. REM-
BRANDT! The entire civilised world were
yielding specimens of the mighty master!
Contributions were coming from Russia,
France, England, everywhere. Sovereigns,
princes, nobles, and many millionaires were
among the contributors! Glorious thought!
I should see the greatest of great painters
face to face I
I have been—swiftly and economically—
to Amsterdam. I braved the terrors of the
deep and a third-class carriage from the
Hook. I put up at an appropriate hotel.
So great was my impatience to see these
grand works of art—to be able to inspect
the solitary presentment of a horse, the
rare mythological subjects—that I took a
train. I spared no expense. Then
rushed up the stairs. I threw some forty
or fifty small coins on the turnstile.
"Not enough."
"Not enough!" I echoed. But I was
imperfectly acquainted with the Dutcl
coinage, so I pulled out of my pocket
several further handfuls of copper discs.
"They amount to half a guilder. No
enough."
"Impossible! How much do you want?
"Two guilders and a half; " and the
gatekeeper pointed to one of my silve
cart-wheels.
But this was too much! The Academ
costs only a shilling, and the Salon on
certain days a franc.
It was too much.
So I have returned. I still love REM
BKANDT. Adore his work. But I did no
see any of his pictures in Amsterdam.
But then, on the other hand, I save<
five franca!

IN answer to an appeal from Mr. Punch
or further novelties, Mr. TESLA offers us
the following : —•
An electric machine for the distribution
of the heat at present running to waste in
the crater of Vesuvius among the kitchens
of the Metropolis, where it would be useful
"or cooking purposes.
An extension of Signer MARCONI'S sys-
;em of wireless telegraphy by which Lon-
don could be supplied with water from the
crnals which astronomers affirm can be per-
ceived on the planet Mars. This should be
of Rreat assistance to the London County
Council.
A flying-machine propelled by electric
waves in the atmosphere, which would en-
able the business-man to go from Clapham
to the City every morning without taking
an omnibus. The same machine would
take him homo in the evening if a return
ticket was taken. Fares—3d. for the jour-
ney, 5d. return.
An electric apparatus by which heat
waves could be attracted from the Sahara
in winter, and cold waves from the North
Pole in Summer, thereby providing an
equable and pleasant climate tor London.
An electric converter by which the X-rays
(Y "X"-rays?) could be utilised in the
lighting of the London streets, and in pro-
pelling motor-carriages between Northum-
berland Avenue and Richmond.
An electric fog-disperser. This ingenious
machine could be set up at every street
corner, and could be set in motion at any
moment on placing a penny in the slot.

TO A FOND MAMMA.
IN these degenerate latter days,
When laissez faire is all the rage,
When boys and maidens go their ways,
And Youth pays little heed to Ape;
When fathers, with, perhaps, a eroan.
Obey their offspring's stern injunctions,
When the exploded chape rone
Performs mere ornamental functions—
In these degenerate times, I say,
One wholesome fact I must report.
There still exists, thank Heaven, to-daj
One mother of the good old sort—
One mother bold beyond the rest,
Her motherly back-seat forsaking,
Pursuing with whole-hearted zest
That fine old industry—match-making!
Dear madam, your appearance rare
Must needs excite our oleased remark,
No longer need we now despair
Of seeing dodos in the Park.
Wo all know where a match is made,
Yet Heaven, being at a distance
(I think it cannot be gainsaid)
Should profit much by your assistance.
Blest wife is she who tries to make
Her precious daughters likewise b'Qe^.
Who bustles round—" for SOPHY'S sake "—
And you are bustling all your best.
Then scorn your neighbours' oaltry smiles
(For ridicule's the meed of virtue),
And, when thev spot your little wiles.
Don't let such trifles disconcert you!
Yet. moved by no intention rude,
I do imolore you to amend
Your methods, some of which are crude—
I speak but as a candid friend.
With pleasure I attend your "shows,"
Bprmi«e by soma right intuition
You label me, a-s I sunpose,
Most wisely, "Not for competition."
Then, since it is my privilege high
To play the part of looker-on,
One further word of warning I
Would venture, by your leave, upon.
One sage remark from days afar
(My nurse's) in my memory lineer —
That those who play with matches are
Extremely apt to burn their fingers.
Still, let not that discourage you,
Play out your fond maternal part.
Each failure trive you strength anew,
And each rebuff increase your art!
Dear madam, I sincerely pray
Success may some day crown your labours
To plant SOPHIA, JANE, and MAY,
Upon your male reluctant neighbours!

IT was a sad spectacle. The Admiral
glanced sorrowfully at the mutineers.
They had disabled the quick-firing guns,
and put out the fires. The disaffection
aboard the Majestic had spread to anothfi

throwing about orange-peel and pomegra

"Will any of you men come out and

Admiral.
There was a movement, and then TOM

know, he hadn't."
"That 's true enough, my lad," returned
the Admiral, struggling with his emotion.
"Then why mutiny 'f"
"Because you stopped our toffee, your
honour. Asking your pardon, we can't
do without our toffee. Since grog was
stopped and tobacco put on the black list,
we can't do without our toffee."
"But be reasonable, my lads," replied
the commander. "You know that toffee

AFTER MACBETH'S BANQUET.
{A Sltakspearean Supplement.)
BY THE SWAN OP STRATFORD-ATTE-BOWE.
THIS is one of the scenes which SHAKSPEARB would have written
if he had only thought of it. As it is, save for a few vague
allusions—guarded, as was natural in members of the house-
party—made, in Act III., Sc. 6. by Lenox and " Another Lord,"
we are quite in the dark as to the private opinions of the guests
concerning a banquet which, either from a social or a gastronomic
point of view, was scarcely a success. Here the omission is sup-
plied, and, in deference to the modern spirit which now animates
blank verse, without too pedantic an insistence upon Elizabethan
diction.
The characters represent those neighbouring lords who, beinp
invited only to the Banquet and not to dine and sleep;" would
naturally walk home so early in the evening without waiting for
their respective-conveyances, and, being human, would inevitably
discuss the eccentric manner in which they had been entertained.
They are : —
Firsl Lord (a, middle-aged, sensible, and somewhit sententious nobleman).
Second Lord (a Kailyard Chieftain, canny and hmnely of s/>eech. M KM.
—It is singular that SHAK.SI'EARE, in a play dealing so largely with
Scottish history and character, should never once hacc attempted t»
suggest the local colour by a touch of diali'ct. But possibly he was not
very good nt it).
Third Lord (a liyht-hearted young Peer with a tendency to .cheery collo
guialism, which some critics may condemn as out of keeping with the
period. But what about the Bird's own anachronisms ?).
The scene is outside the Palace Gates, Forres. And now we
can get on:
First Lord (to Second Lord, as they pan out). You go my
way, I think?
Second Lord (with clMracteristic caution). I 'd no juist say
My road was in a deeferent direction.
First Lord. Good I Shall we walk together?
Seond Lord. Gin ye wull.
Third Lord (calling- after them). What ho I.you fellows, wait a
jiff for me. [They do.
(Overtaking them.) Well? . . . What price Highland
hospitality?
First L. Think you MACBETH 's deliberately done us?
Third L. He cannot boast that he has done us well.
To be fired out, our mouths still full of salmon,
And shown the exit e'er we saw an entree,
Was scarce encouragement to come again I
First L. King DUNCAN never would have served us so 1
Second L. Ou ay, his denners were a wee bit dooll—
But hoots! a body filled his wame the while!
Third L. MACBETH'S idea of being ''large in mirth"
Would cast a gloom upon the cheeriest funeral.
Second L. Sal! but the feckless way he sent us in!
"Set doon," says he, "ye ken yer ain degrees."
'Twas naething but rideeculous to see
A MTJNKITTRICK below the MACINTOSH,
And auld GLENLIVAT girn abune the saut!
Third L. A jumpier host I ne'er clapped eyes upon;
He seemed incapable of sitting down!
Fir.it L. Most upstarts are deficient in repose.
1'hird L. His Queen supplied the style; you heard his speech?
"Ourself will mingle with Society,
Our hostess keeps her state." How "s that for fiills?
•S'ecind L. The stoot stand-offish kimmer, set her up!
I mind the day herself, a captain's leddy,
Wad blush for pleesure gin we praised her haggis!
First L. These unaccustomed crowns cause swollen heads,
And self-made monarchs oft outgrow their boois.
Third L. He used to be a decent sort enough,
And really seemed confoundedly cut up
About that business up at Inverness.
Second L. 1 canna think he 's been the same men sence.
'Tis verra strange
Third L. Nay, not so baliy strange.
For when a fellow puts up Scotland's king,
Just for the night, and bundles out of bed
To hear his royal guest's been foully murdered
By his own sons,—well, put it how you like,
'Tis apt to prove a rather nasty jar!
Second L. I 'm no denying but ye may be richt.
What wull ha' keepit BANQUO from the denner?
Third L. Oh, "unavoidably detainel," no doubt.
Or " felt too indisposed "—the good old lie!
First L. The King, methought, was less annoyed than hurt,
So heartily he drank to his good health!
Second L. 'Twas no the first gude health he 'd drunk the day.
Third L. Why. now I think of it, he did seem odd:
Complained of seeing things
First L. (with interest). What things, my lord?
Third L. Oh, well, yon know—the usual sort of things.
For instance (if I caught his words aright),
Such creatures as a rugged Russian bear,
An armed rhinoceros, and Hyrcan tiger.
Second L. (with patriotic indignation). There's no sic beaaties
in the hail o' Scotland I
First L. 'Tis well, indeed, we came without our wives.
Small wonder that his scandalous behaviour
Should so upset the Queen, who little thought
To see the massy superincumbent gilt
Thus soon forsake her royal gingerbread!
It strikes me (but you 'II let this go no further)
Those two have failed of late to hit it off.
I may be wrong
Second L. Na, na, ye 're no faur aff 't,
She canna bide his blether! I ken fine
Third L. (impatiently). More full we seem of gossip than of grub,
\\ hat say you to some supper at the club?

hate to do a Public Service anonymously.
So I write to you on the subject of a recent
achievement of mine.
On November 9 (the fact is complacently
recorded in a Sunday paper), 1 saw a line
sparrow-hawk in Shoreilitch Park.'.'"At-
tracted probably by the deceptive rusticity
of the place, the bird had perched on a
niche in the wall of St. Leonard's Church,
and was lost in contemplation of the muni-
cipal activity of Shoreditch."
Did I allow this intrusive wild fowl tn
enjoy the country airs of Shoreditch J';u k ;-
Perish the thought. To quote the same
Sunday journal, "A whack from a stick
temporarily disabled her, nnd le<l to her
being captured and caged." Here was
irdeed a Public Service. A fine sparrow-
hawk was wasting its sweetness on the
London air. At any moment it might
have flown away and been lost to Shore-
ditch. I whacked it over the head, there-
fore, and it is now dying in a leisurely
manner in a cage.
This is not the only claim of my family
to public gratitude in this direction. I am
the person who, with secret catapult, kills
the nightingales which even yet disturb
the quiet of Campden Hill. All rarer
forms of birds and beasts are my prey, and
my brother in the country with his gun
shoots all the golden eagles that visit those
shores, and does his best to destroy all the
kingfishers that haunt our rivers. When
he has bagged his golden eagle or other
unusual fowl, he writes proudly to the
Times to mention the fact, nml signs /n'.s
nami'! He and I, by our united efforts,
are gradually extinguishing whole species
of interesting wild creatures in England
and in London.
Often our efforts are met with the
grossest ingratitude, and only the other
day a gentleman called me a stupid brute
who ought to be kicked by all decent
people, but I don't mind him. And mean-
time the good work goes on.
In full assurance of your gratitude and
support, I beg to sign myself,
Your obedient servant, 'ARRY.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DARBY JONES ON THE PAST SEASON AND
THE "ILLEGITIMATE CAME."
HONOURED SIR,—At Manchester we rang
down the Curtain on that Interesting
Drama entitled "Flat-Racing in 1898; or,
The Year beloved by the Bookie." It does
not take a Sportsman versed in Memoria
Technica to recall the countless occasions
on which the Favourites have been bowled
over with the Devastating Result of a
First-Rate Spin in a Skittle Alley. The
Guineas, the Derby, the Oaks, the Leger,
the Caesarewitch, the Cambridgeshire, the
Derby Cup, and many other Upper Ten
events, were all captured by Outsiders at
prices calculated to make a Sporting Pro-
phet take to sweeping crossings in com-
pany with his too confident Patrons. And
on the top of this came J. TOD SLOAN,
Esquire, who, just to show that He could
ride Favourites in Big Races, carried off
the Liverpool Cup as a parting present to
Lord STANLEY before he made tracks over
the Herring Pond Course. Indeed, hon-
oured Sir, it would have made COBDKN'S
Statue in Camden Town (I am naming the
Hardest Effigy in the Metropolis) weep,
to have seen the Gallant Efforts made by
Disappointed Owners and Trainers at
Derby and Manchester to collect the
Wherewithal to supply Biscuits and Cheese
and Four Ale during the Winter Months.
You may depend upon it, that despite the
Sneers of the High Tone, the "Illegiti-
mate," as they designate the Pursuit of
jumping Hurdles, Ditches, Brooks, and
other Stumbling-Blocks, will be followed
this year more largely than ever by those
who are famishing for Provender, just as
a Billiardist, who has been knocked out in
a West-End Saloon, will seek to recoup
his Fortune by playing Bagatelle at the Cat
and Mousetrap in Kentish Town with the
Lower Order or Cueists. Though why such
Natural Sport as Stoeplechasing and
Hurdleracing should be dubbed "Illegiti-
mate " I am at a loss to determine. Nearly
all our leading Lights, from the Heir-
Apparent downwards, patronise the game,
and the Conqueror in the Grand National
becomes for the nonce as famous as, say,
the SIRDAR, G.C.B.. or the latest Vocalist
at the Alhambra Theatre of Varieties.
But as Captain KRITERION very truly re-
marks, "Over the Sticks there's such n
lot of chance, that when you 've got a Dead
Certainty, it 's as likely as not he becomes
dead indeed by breaking his back in a
miserable drain." Of course, Hurdles are
quite a different feature, and many a Crock
who can hardly lift his forelegs off the Turf
on the Flat becomes, by crashing at the
obstacles, valueless.
Nevertheless, when the Sport is encour-
aged at such Racing Centres as Not-

CHRISTMAS CRACKERS.— G. SPARAGNA-
PANE & Co. have sent a charming selection
of bright and attractive-looking crackers
this year. An exceptionally pretty get are
the Pensez-d-moi cosaques, beautifully
scented, and each one ornamented with a
pansy; they are furnished with eau-de-
Cologne satchets, &c. Last, but not least,
is a box containing three monster cosaques.
Don't be frightened at the word "mon-
ster," as these present a very attractive
appearance, each fitted up with nine dif-
ferent articles. In a cracker motto should
be found this couplet:—
If to perfection cracker-man attains,
Hi- motto must be this, " Spare-ah-na-paiti»."
We do not say that this is by the Poet-
laureate, but he might have done worse.

modestly, and admitted that it wasn't. Mamma and I think he is

The Trosxaclix.—Mr. H. must be very rich. He has not taken
a shooting this season, but last year he had two thousand brace
of grouse to dispose of, and Papa says only a very big shooting
would yield such a bag. He is a charming acquisition. He gets
up delightful picnics, and money seems to be no object. Papa
thinks now that he must have something to do with the Stock
Exchange, for the other day, the conversation happened to turn
on some Refrigerator Company in which Papa is interested.
Mr. H. seemed to know all about it, "for," he explained, "I have
dabbled in ice a little."
This place is too beautiful. I should like to live here forever!
Last night Mr. H. rowed me up Loch Katrine to Ellen's Isle,
and we read Tin' Lady of tin- Lake together.

to-morrow. I have said " Good-bye" to CHARL—I mean, Mr. H.
Oh, sweet "Good-bye!" This evening, in the verandah—but it
i* too precious even for you, my Diary! Still, there is consolation.
He lives near us in London; nay, he drives in his trap down our
road nearly every morning. He must be rich: he keeps six
horses, and I do love a carriage! Well, well, we have parted,
but we may meet again.
Kensington.—How can I tell what has happened? How de-
scribe the wrath, shame, fury, humiliation that torment me?
Mamma had long been dissatisfied with her fishmonger, and
yesterday, when we were calling on dear Lady PENNIWISE, she
advised us to try the Yarmouth and North Sea Fish Supply
Association. It is a shop in the Harrow Road, one side full of
fried fish, ticketed "Snacks, one penny per portion," the other
» common nshmonger-and-poulterer's. We entered. A man in
his shirt-sleeves was standing with his back to us, busy at a
sink. It was dark; I could hardly see him, but a sudden terror
seized me. I clutched Mamma's arm. The man turned round

2/UM, Luck Lomond,—Wo started this morning to cycle round
the Trossachs, Mamma and Papa on their tandem, and I on my
machine. When we had got well up into the wilds—fifteen miles
from anywhere—the tandem punctured. None of us had ever
mended a tyre before, but Papa said it was all right as he had the
"Instructions," so we set to work under his directions and un-
screwed valves and hubs and cranks and things, till Papa said
that would do. Then he began to wrestle with the tyre. For a
long time he could make no impression, so Mamma and I came
to his assistance, and we all pulled and tugged in different direc-
tions, till suddenly, to our horror, both the wheels came off and
the whole machine collapsed. Papa said we must have done
something wrong, but as for Mamma and me, we burst out cry-
ing. It was long, long past lunch-time, and oh! we were so
huiigry, and yet, for anything we could see to the contrary, we
might have to stay on that inhospitable moor till we slowly
starved to death. We were just contemplating this awful fate
when, to our unspeakable delight, a gentleman rode up. If ewr
there was an angel Tall, dark, faultlessly dressed, with the
sweetest curly moustache—I could have kissed him then and
there 1 HP dismounted, and with a charming bow, asked if he
could assist nv. In less than no time the machine was put to-
gether and the puncture mended; then we set out under his
guidance and arrived here.
After all his kindness we could not do less than bee him to
dine with us. He is a Mr. HBRHISG—one of the Yarmouth
HERRINGS, a very old family, Mamma assures me. He seems to
know quite a lot of our friends in Kensington. I wonder we
never met him anywhere. He evidently mixes with the best
people. There's Lady PENMWISE, for instance, whom we were
just getting to know: he says he calls on her two or three times
a week, and when she gave her great ball last season, she con-
sulted him about the lobster salad.
Invertnaid.—We are staying here two or three days, and so
is Mr. H. We can't quite make out what he is, but he is de-
lightful. Yesterday he took us out fishing, and in a very few
minutes landed a twenty-pound salmon. Papa congratulated
sight of us he smiled, bowed, and advanced towards us, but with
a shriek, Mamma and I had fled.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN AUSriXlAD.
(Ily Mr. flinch'* Vagrant diiitribulor.)
So you're at it again, my ALFRED! How stupendously crushing
it must be for the other unfortunate nations,
To say nothing of Great Britain and Ireland, when you break out
in the usual place with one of your (don't take offence at my
language: I don't mean any harm) with one of your versified
lucubrations.
I can fancy how France must be crouching, and how President
FAURE grows purple in a perfectly impotent fashion
When he reads in the Tinirit of Wednesday, November 23rd, your
outburst, which, by the way, burst on us from the Villa di
Jiellosguardu, of patriotism and lyrical passion.
The CZAR, I am told, when he read your ode, gave way to a
terrible fit of Imperial Russian hysteria.
And raved about knouts and the secret police, and (though I'm
not quite certain about this, not having been there at the
time, but still I Ve uo doubt it's reasonably accurate, and in
any case it's likely enough) dropped some highly uncomfort-
able hints about penal mines and Siberia.
And as for WILLY, the tourist, that stout and moustachioed
spouter,
I shouldn't wonder if fury were to prevent him just for once
from yielding to his all but irresistible inclination to drink
champagne and figure as a shouter:
He 's bound to cower and shrink (which ought to do him good
for he 's certainly on the fat side) and his nerves will be all
in a panic, a
Condition they 're not much used to, when he first sets eyes on
your ode entitled "Pax Britannica."
By the way, dear ALF, when next you sit down (or walk about)
with your forehead corrugated in consequence of prolonged
thinking,
With your well-fingered lyre lying close to your side prepared to
be struck like winking,
While your waistcoat-buttons keep popping off with a noise that,
if we heard it, would most profoundly affect us,
Owing to the fearful amount of poetic afflatus which happens to
be stirring about in your peetus,
When next in fact you start writing an ode at the Villa di some-
thing or other,
And you're tired of the usual metres and feel that, even if you
should die for it (but of course I sincerely hope you won't),
you must really try another.
Why shouldn't you try this metre of mine; it's simple and, ex-
cept to those who have to publish it at so much a line, it's
thoroughly inexpensive,
The chief point in its favour being that if you want to say a great
many things you can just go and say them, since, as of course
you have observed, the metre is extraordinarily extensive.
Well, ALFRED, I read your ode, I did, as I am a living sinner;
Bead it at breakfast first and then again at lunch, and, having
found it a moderately good digestive, read it a third time
at dinner.
Of course it's a thoroughly sound and patriotic and recklessly
dare-devil effusion,
Filled up to the brim with disdain and sarcasm and every sort
of high-toned allusion,
But—it's my fault, I know; I acknowledge it with deep regret:
still, there it is, you must take a man as you find him and
make the best of it,
Not that I think for a single moment that anything I have to
say will have an effect on your wonderful ode, or be in the
least degree a test of it—
But the fact is, your ode has mixed me up, brewed me, in short,
and I 'm not accustomed to brewing,
And in this peculiar condition I can't make out for the life of
me, in spite of ever so many honest attempts, what the lady
you write about is doing.
For at first she 's lying behind her ramparts which (but isn't this
rather a new trick for ramparts? Of course, you know best,
I merely mention it incidentally) are rolling,
And she 's weaving some long-drawn hours, an occupation which,
under the circumstances, she must find wonderfully consoling.
In the next verse the seasons are mentioned, that is to say,
Spring, Summer and Autumn (N.B. to the printer:
Give them all a capital letter), but in this connection I feel
called upon to remark that it was manifestly unjust and
plainly the result of partisan feeling to omit all mention of
Winter.
I should like to know how you justify this exclusion and what in
the wide world can have been your reason,
For it's obvious that Winter, if he had had n chance, could have

UNDERSTAND THEM!"
done things every bit as humorous and absurd as any other
season.
Well, to proceed, this lady of yours who when you first introduced
her was lying without any motion,
When we next come across her she 's haughtily heedless and she'»
still, though you hadn't mentioned it before, ploughing her
peaceful way in strong disdain across ocean.
Now this is an operation during which most ordinary voyagers are
pretty severely billowed,
But the lady you write of behaved in quite a different way, for, if
we may trust the rest of the spectators, who were jealous
nations and naturally wanted to slake their envy, she tra-
velled with a Past on which she was pillowed.
But at last she evidently got back from her ploughing and
stirred like a lion—a lioness would have been apter—
And shook out her strength and flashed and asked where her foes
were, which seems a more or less silly question, but I admit
lions often do ask silly questions, and then in her armour she
wrapped her.
And after that—but I can't go on for the whole business gets
tied up in an almighty tangle of curses,
And fields and forges and lyres and fires and anvils and embattled
hosts and vows that were futile—such a chaos as I never met
with in any one else's verses.
So, ALFRED, when next there's a crisis on, and you're tempted
to play the bard, oh,
Refrain, if you love us, from writing verse at the Villa di
Bellosguardo.

Lo I as ia laid the fowler's gin
For conies and for hares,
So do the pleasant paths of sin
Abound in deadly snares.
Of such as oft offend his foot
Who wanders from the fold,
Of these the tap-, or primal, root
Is giddy lust of gold.

Like unto tatted kine,
Nor with the wicked choose the ways
Of darkness down a mine.
With godly rage and grief renewed,
Their fervid breast is am it
To mark the naughty multitude
Descend into the Pit.
And, as of wine th' enticing red
They shun within the cup,
So at the ore they shake their head
When it is scoope'd up.
Yea, for the foolish heathen's sake
They labour long and sore
The pleasant paths of sin to make
Less pleasant than before.
And whoso will not turn away
Nor. timely wise, repent,
Upon his lifted oof they lay
A tftx of five per cent.
So from the sinful yellow crop,
As with a whetted scythe,
The faithful ones delight to lop
Their wago of half a tithe.
Though pious men of single eye
Not paid can be with pelf,
Who helpeth Heaven may thereby
Be found to help himself.
Thus for an holy end they take
The spoil of them that spin.
And from their filthy lucre rake
The goodly shekels in.
Thus reap they virtue's guileless gains
And may with him compare
Who in his borders entertains
An angel unaware.
No fear of dearth or grievous debt
Their hearts shall e'er appal
Who, like the hungry ravens, get
By faith their wherewithal.
Look not to princes! These at need
Betray the trusting tout;
The ways of Kaisers are indeed
Past hope of finding out!
Blind in their ignorance or youth
By crooked paths they go.
Nor yet have learned the blessed truth
Which runneth as below : —
Who lend the righteous uf their store
May build this hope upon,
To reap an hundredfold, or mure,
Not now, but later on!

CONFIDENCES.
(Retracted from Mr. Punch's I'uxl-liag.)
IT.
DEAR MR. PFNCH,— The troupe from
which I am suffering is so personal and
private that I must reveal it to my friend
— need I say, to you, Sir?
Let me state my case briefly. I am
deeply, passionately in love with CICELY
DICKINSON, who is the most—but I spare
you the epithets. CICELY, I am afraid,
does not at present love me, though she
ought to do so, since she loves my dog.
But the trouble is that the dog isn't really
my dog at all, but somebody else's. This
explanation is not particularly lucid, hut
I will endeavour to make it clear.
I only say this because I am perfectly
confused. It is my theory that there is
nothing like reducing things to paper. So
I reduce this to paper in the hope that the
process may do me good.
I live in chambers, and the man in the
rooms above mine, with whom I have no
personal acquaintance, owns a fox-terrier
of migratory habits. The beast has a way
of wandering into my room, where it esta-
blishes itself on the hearth-rug until I
happen to notice it. Then I throw a
volume of the Lair Rrports at it, and it
bolts. One day it happened to be in the
room when CICELY and her aunt had come
to tea with me; of course, I should have
kicked it out had I seen it. CICELY, how-
ever, perceived it first, and went into rap-
tures over it.
"Oh, what a perfect beauty!" she cried.
"I never knew you were fond of does,
Mr. TINKLEH," and she looked at me with
a new friendliness in her eves that made
my heart leap. "What is his name?"
"Sambo," I replied, promptly—not be-
cause I knew, but it seemed a fairly pro-
bable sort of name. Luckily, the animal
wore no collar. Of course, I ought to have
explained that the dog wasn't mine, but
you will understand why I didn't.
"Dear Sambo," said CICELY, "come
here, Rambo," and she proceeded to feed
him with my bread-and-butter and cake.
Then I had to answer a great many ques-
tions about his age and habits, which was
rather difficult, as no one can know less
about dogs than myself. However. I man-
aged to satisfy her somehow, and I was
conscious that CICELY regarded pie with
much more respect than before—simply on
account of that wretched animal. But I
did not mind, especially as she stayed much
longer than usual.
Presently I heard the sound of feet over-

head; the man upstairs was going out.
Then there came a succession of impatient
whistles, and a voice shouting, Snap!
Snap!"
Instantly the supposed Sambo rushed to
the door, and placed his fore-paws against
it, whining eagerly. I thought it better
to let him out, because his owner would
have been sure to hear him as he came
downstairs.
"A—a friend of mine," I explained.
"He—he takes Sainbn out for a walk for
me sometimes."
CICELY looked rather surprised. "But
why did he call him ' Snap'? she inquired.
"It's—it's a nickname he has for him,"
I said, and managed to change the sub-
ject. But when CICELY departed, she
made me promise to bring Sambo with me
when next I came to call. When the time
came, and I appeared without him, my
explanation that he was confined to the
house by a cold in his head was rather
badly received. So the next time I bought
another dog, and took him instead. This
move, too, was a failure. CICELY ex-
pressed her surprise that the owner of
Sambo should have purchased such an
uninteresting cur. So I wrote to the man
upstairs, offering to buy Snap, alias Sambo,
at his own price. This proposal was de-
clined with such unnecessary warmth that
I do not dare to suggest as an alternative
that I should hire the beast for a couple
of months.
In the meantime, I never meet CICELY
without her inquiring after Sambo. She
and her aunt are coming here again next
week on purpose to see him. I shall have
to put them off somehow, because the man
upstairs has gone into the country, and
taken Sambo—I mean Snap—with him.
To confess all would be ruin ; CICELY would
never speak to me again. What am I to
do? Yours distractedly,
THOMAS TINKLER.

started originally by Mr. Punch's own Prehistoric Artist, and,
therefore, what better recommendation can there be of any such
book than to name the artist P His "Leopard," who "waits for
hours in the hall," is the gem of this eccentric collection, specially
recommended for Christmas time.
My Baronitess writes, concerning some Christmas Books, that
The Boys of Fairmead (F. WARNF. & Co.), by M. C. ROWSELL,
though by no means an original plot, is a well-told story, with
many touches of pathos. The characters of the two boys are
well denned. Illustrations by CHRIS HAMMOND. The Owl King,
and Other Tales (F. WARNB & Co.), by Rev. H. C. INMAN, forms
quite a new set of short fairy stories, brightly told, with illus-
trations by E. A. Mason. Fancy! New Fairies! The "Old
Fairies " were always wicked ones. Imagine how good then these
brand new ones must be!
Roundabout Khymes (BLAOKH AND SON), written and pictured
by Mr*. PBRCT DKAU.MKH, will give many happy half-hours to
little ones. The amusing verses are accompanied by bright and
original illustrations which add to their charm.
Dash and Daring (W. AND R. CHAMBERS, Limited, Edinburgh),
being stories told by G. A. HBNTT, G. MANVILLE FENN, DAVID
KER, W. H. G. KINGSTON, REGINALD HORSLEY, and many others.
A set of short, stirring adventures in India, Africa. Spain, and
other countries. To readers who like to "wander in their
minds" through the four quarters of the great globe, this book
will be of the greatest interest. It contains eight stirring illus-
trations by W. H. C. GROOME, a name suggestive of an artist who
should have illustrated the work of Dr. GORDON STABLES,
the author of Courage, True Hearts (BLACKIE AND SON),
which is all about a restless vouth discovering a veritable
Tom Tiddler's ground, and picking up no end of shekels.
The same firm publish the works of the ever-busy G. A. HENTY,
who skips with his boy readers over Itoth Sides the Border
during the fifteenth century, when the Welsh and Scotch were
getting themselves exceedingly disliked by trying to unseat
one of our own particular HENRYS. The youthful hero is
quite at his very best in such cheerfully disquieting times, and,
as is only natural, he comes scatheless through, to the joy of his
family. But in Aboukir and Acre, HENTY makes history prac-
tically repeat itself by re-telling the invasion of Egypt by NAPO-
LEON, when Lt petit Caporal found out that there is no royal mad
to the Nile. In Under Wellington's Command, the same author
attempts an imitation of CHARLES LEVER. Evidently the Penin-
sular War gave the voung Irish officers some opportunities for
displaying the typical humours of the Green Isle.
Harmless, and without profanity, is the nursery edition of The
New Noah'e Ark, by J. J. BEEL. In fact the pictures are stiffly
and correctly conventional, quite on the lines of the perfect
propriety models that were the fascination of the ancient Lowther
Arcade School. The Sporting Adventure! of Mr. Popp/e, chron-
icled and illustrated by G. H. JALLAND, are of an old-fashioned
sporting period, the time of "Jorrocks." Popple has his
amusing moments brightly depicted by the sportive artist. Both
these books come from the stores kept at the Bodley Head, by
JOHN LANE. THE BARON DB B.-W.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.

N.B. —DO.N'T LEAVE YOUR SHOPPING UNTIL THE TWENTY-FOURTH, UNLESS YOU LOVE A Cursii I.IKE THIS.
HOW TO WRITE A CHRISTMAS ANNUAL
Advice to Young Writeri.
1. CHOOSE a suitable and seasonable sub-
ject, such as murder, suicide, or insanity;
if you can work in all three, so much the
better.
2. If you want to make your story a
success, pay great attention to your cha-
racters; the introduction of any character
more cheerful than an undertaker might
prevent its acceptance and ultimate ap-
pearance. A hero with softening of the
brain, a heroine who is hysterical, and a
villain who is a, homicidal maniac, ought, if
properly handled, to provide your tale with
sufficient interest.
3. For the setting of your story, you
can have no better place than a marsh;
nothing is more suggestive of damp and
discomfort. A gloomy wood, a blasted
heath and a chilly cavern also fortn suitable
settings.
4. The weather is very important, so

Bay, old chap, I think I 've knocked you out this
time."
[The gathering of dishes of strawberries is reported
from all parts of the country.—Daily Paper.']
much can be done with "black, impene-
trable fog," "the low white mist rising
from the lake," "hail-stones stinging like
whips of steel," " the blinding rain," "the
roar of the tempest," "the howling of the
wind," " the numbing, biting cold. Frost
and snow are rarely, if ever, used; they
are generally kept for the Summer
Annuals.
5. Pile on the agony. You cannot write
in too gloomy a strain; the more gloom
you put into your story, the more season-
able you make it.
6. The ending is very important. If
you are unable to kill off all your charac-
ters, at least you will exercise sufficient
care that your tale ends unhappily; and
having done this, and conscientiously car-
ried out my instructions, you may look
upon the acceptance of your story by a
Christmas Annual publisher as a certainty.
A PROTEST.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—I think it high time
to protest against Ludgate Hill being
allowed to claim the distinction of being
the "worst station in the world." Have I
been dirty, draughty, bewildering, shaky
| and generally obnoxious for so many years
without my demerits being recognised by
the thousands who have burrowed into my
dirty labyrinths, or been baked, drenched
or frozen on my ricketty platforms? If
this be the case, I had better be pulled
down at once, and some pretentious,
absurd, and comfortable edifice erected on
my ashes. Really, it seems useless to try
and displease everybody.
Yours despondently,
CLAPHAM JUNCTION.
MOLLIA TEMPORA FANDI.

MADAM, I come—my present task,
I do protest, is far from jolly—
I come, in point of fact, to ask

But my affection is unbounded;

To prove him a gentleman Bear.

Not a line, not a word ever written
Disproves that our Eagle's a hen.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
SIMPLY delightful is the collection, published in perfect style
and form by "the Old House at Home, viz., Messrs. BRADBURY,
AGNEW, & Co., of Master PHIL MAY'S drawings, illustrating the
truly whimsical notion of Songx and their Singers, though per-
haps the more appropriate title would have been, Songs without
SingerSj since the talented vocalists, pour rire, do not seem in any
case quite up to their work. But oblige the Baron by casting your
eye on "The Storm Fiend." Isn't he delightful! Likewise admire
"The Warrior Bold," with his toes turned in, and the feeblest
notes issuing from his un-clarion-like throat, whence issues no
"certain sound " for the battle. But they are all delightful and
Things of the Beautifully Humorous and Joyous for Ever, es-
pecially at the merry time of Christmas, when, in mid-winter, we
rejoice in the present ful-PmL-ment of the promise, in the per-
formance, of MAY.
Most sincerely does the Baron trust that in real life there are
not very many such cases as the two that go to make up the
story of Mutineers (JOHN LANE), as told by A. E. T. LEGGE. A
woman, well worth winning, twic3 marries, and each time it is
"the wrong 'un "; the only distinction between the two choices
being that number one is utterly wrong, while number two is
what may be termed a "faute-de-mif,ux " chap. The other case,
in a much lower social scale, is that of a kindly draggle-tailed
file, speaking the language of an 'Arriet, who is desperately and
honestly in love with the above-mentioned faute-de-mieux young
man, and having thus aroused the jealousy of her former para-
mour, a drunken scoundrel of a fellow who has been desperately
attached to her, she meets her death at his hands, and then he
kills himself. That's the story. The first part of it, "in
Society," is pleasant and bright, and the characters lead you on
to hope for the excitement that never comes.

I was a fighter once; but that is past,
Except on paper. You recall the time
When, under that great Captain's eagle

I in the golden prime of Derby days,
You at Newcastle (somewhere in the
North),
We fought like Kitcheners for Irish Rule-
Or was it Local Veto ? One forgets !
How like a dream the youthful splendour

For we were relatively young, and took
Time by the forelock, which is not the same
As Celtic fringes. Life had colour then,
And where the shadows crossed it, you
and I,
Did we not let our sunbeam-play of wit
Fall like a glad surprise? I fancy so.

And now a common blueness, winter's wear,
Obscures the prospect—which is also blue.

And foreign complications; signs himself
Patriot first and politician next,
And has a curious way of winning hearts !
That is the Man whose blood I wish to have.

credit (when sordid traders would not)
for having never ceased to impress upon
my Patrons that the Sport of Emperors
and lesser Potentates is not game whereat
those but mediocrely endowed with the
Spondulicks of Fortune can play. The
Account Rendered of the Flat-Racing

assertion that in this diversion, even as
Sweets go to the Sweet, so are Riches
heaped on to Riches, with but few of those
Exceptions which serve to prove the
Aureous Rule. At the summit of the

mart, Golden Bridge, Trident, and St. Brix,
places the very comfortable sum of
£30,267 10s. to his banking account. It
would be interesting to know what (doubt-
less) Unsparing Outlay on Mr. LEOPOLD'S
part was so handsomely recouped. Then

MINSTER and Mr. C. D. ROSE, almost

honest half-sovereigns) ; after whom follow

i* not a Needy Owner from Mr. DOUGLAS
BAIRD down to Mr. J. A. MII.LF.R. If I
can trust my somewhat Defective Memory,
I think it was a noble Northerner and
Steward of the Jockey Club, who once
declared that Wealthy Prizes attracted
Wealthy Patrons, and that this fact con-
duced to the Glory of the Turf, which,
being interpreted, means, "only Million-
aires need apply!"
Far be it from one so humble as Myself
to cavil at the Ipse Dixit of a Great
Authority, but in quite a Uriah-Heep-like
vein, I venture to suggest that if, instead
of having Three " Ten Thousand Pounders"
per annum, the authorities were to spread
their Golden Syrup over some of the Dry
Crusts offered to the Little Equine Specu-
lators, it would do much to do away with
"Bottlers" in Selling Races. There are
many Honest Harvesters who would like a
Cut at the Corn, without being compelled
to resort to continual Gleaning for a sub-
sistence. I am no JACK STRAW or WAT
TYLER, honoured Sir, but if you or any
other Bulwark of Equine Equality will
consult the Record of Foreign Racing, you
will readily perceive that in the matter
of distributing Prize-Mortey, th«y do these
things better in France, though to be sure,
from our point of view, the Gaul is wofully
lacking in Free Trade principles, and pre-
fers to keep the majority of his "Bits"
for Home-made bridles. Captain KRITE-
RION prophesies, that if I persist in my
"ill-advised theory," I shall be warned off
Newmarket Heath. I need scarcely say
that in this respect he has the advantage
over your dutiful servant, DARBY JONBS.
P.S.—I humbly submit my remarks to
that Great Gimoracker, Lord DURHAM, who
appears to be a sort of Jockey Club General
BOULANGBR. There is a Minister for Agri-
culture, why not one for Turfculture?
Lord DURHAM might take the office, and
be Government Handicapper, Starter,
Chucker-out, and Head Lad all rolled into
one. His ancestor killed the Lambton
\Vorm. His Lordship might slay the Hydra-
headed Horrors, which are apparently bred
on the Turf like rabbits. They would be
sure to succumb to Durham mustard.—D. J.

Are fain to fly to.
Through London as your way you wind
It staggers the bucolic mind,
And overawes it;
Yet does it not occur to you.
The busy turmoil as you view,
'Tis you that cause it?
We tolerate the noisy show.
Wait patiently until you go

Till once more with its normal hush
London recovers from the rush
Of rus in urbe.

Attention has been called to the growing practice of tipping
railway-guards to secure sep'irate compartments. This causes
inconvenience to other passengers, and is also provocative of
annoyance to the man who gives the tip, when the Russian

mean—open, and admits half-ar-dozen women and babies. The
Russians, in this instance at least, do believe in the policy of

I HAVE sometimes noticed, darling, as I stroked your suky head
And sought for glowing words wherewith to woo, my dear,
There was just the least monotony about the things I said,
A tendency to sameness—haven't you, my dear?
In my most impassioned moments, when I 've gazed into your

And vowed that I would love you evermore, my dear,
It has jarred upon me harshly as I seemed to realise
That I 'd said as much a dozen times before, my dear.
But the happy, happy Manxman, he may sing his mistress' praise,
In language made by Venus for her son, my dear,
And the rogue ! he whispers gaily in some ninety-seven ways
What I can but reiterate in one, my dear.
He can murmur, "Love, I love you!" in the pleasant morning
shade
Till the shadows of the night are falling dark, my dear,
And he never need be conscious that he has alrea Jy made
Ad nauseam a similar remark, my dear.
Manx is certainly par excellence the language for Love's song,
The tongue that Cupid speaks when he would court, my dear,
For the lovers in the Isle of Man may cut their tales as long
As pussy-cats are wont to cut theirs short, my dear.
And as I would fain be courting you when Dawn begins to smile
Till dews are falling on the primrose banks, my dear,
I propose we spend our honeymoon up yonder in the Isle,
Where you and I might learn to woo in Manx, my dear.

AN UNFORTUNATE MORNING.
WITH the careful economy of the newly
married, I had get aside a certain sum for
my Christmas presents, arranging before-
hand the exact amount I would expend on
my wife, my relatives, the dear little GAB-
WAY children, and others.
To fldner down Bond Street, conscious ot
the agreeable power of giving immense
pleasure to those one loves, by a few
seasonable gifts, is a sensation of luxury.
But things happened rather awkwardly.
In the palace of silver and leather, where
I lingered looking for a suitable present for
DOROTHY, I met a cigarette-case of such
obvious suitability to myself, that not to
order it—with my initials in plain, heavy
silver-gilt—seemed almost a foolish extra-
vagance. Again, at the jeweller's, where
I sought for a single gem to sparkle in my
wife's pretty hair, a certain pair of tur-
quoise studs and a pin, of exquisite though
severe workmanship, appealed, beyond re-
sistance, to my sober, cultivated taste.
Searching for a "useful" present for a
pet aunt of practical leanings, I found in
the celebrated umbrella-shop a perfect
little stick. It was neither too large nor
too small. It was distinguished, but not
eccentric; it seemed made for me, and 1
hoped it would accompany me on many
a pleasant ramble.
I now rather hastily passed into a book-
shop to get Every Boy's Annual and Little
Folks. How pleasant it would be to see
the bright eyes of the dear little GARWAYS
become brighter still as they read the
delightful stories and put their sticky
fingers on the lovely pictures! Children
always judge of artistic productions, when
it is possible, by the sense of touch—some-
times even by that of taste, and there may
be much to be said for their view. But in
this too fascinating home of literature, ill-
luck again pursued me. I am a bibliophile
at moments, and the atmosphere of a
library goes to my head and warps my
VOL. ox v.

DOGS AND THEIR DUTY.
(By Our Own £.-porter.)
A MEETING was held, within the last
week, at midnight, in the absence of the
moon, to consider the recent speech of
Mr. LONG about the muzzling order. The
chair (a garden one) was taken by Mr.
Fox TERRIER. The spot chosen for the
gathering was a little-frequented square.
The chairman said that he had great
Eleasure in presiding on that occasion, as
e felt his canine colleagues had a distinct
grievance. Personally, he was little af-
fected by the iniquitous muzzling order, as
when he took the air it was in a carriage.
Mr. SiiKK.i'K Doo protested against
"side." No one wanted to hear about
Mr. Fox TERRIER'S carriage-drives.
The chairman intended no offence. He
only desired to say that he was acting un-
selfishly in the matter. He called upon
Mr. POODLE to move the first resolution.
Mr. POODLE, at this appeal, begged to
move "that it is the opinion of this meet-
ing that the entire human race is becoming
insane, and conseauently, if the muzzle be
necessary, it should be removed from the
dog to be placed on the inouth of his so-
called master." Statistics proved that

CONFIDENCES.
(Extractedfrom Mr. Punch's Post-bag.)
III.
DEAR SIB,—I venture to ask your assist-
ance in a most delicate matter. Nothing
short of destitution could have caused me
to make such an appeal, and I am sure
that you will regard it as written in strict
confidence.
I am, Sir, a Family Ghost. In the good
old days, I did uncommonly well; my work
for leading novelists kept me busy through
most of the year. But it was in the
months of November and December that
my best season came, for there was hardly
a Christmas number published in which 1
didn't get a job. Punctually as the last
stroke of midnight on Christmas eve faded
into silence, I appeared at the heroine's
bedside. Beckoning with impressive fore-
finger, I bade her follow me, and together
we passed through the lonely oak corridors
of the ancestral mansion. Outside the
wind moaned drearily, and the snow fell
fast. (I often thought that it must be
horribly cold work for the poor girl, but of
course that was no business of mine.)
Arriving at last at the topmost attic, I
pointed to the spot in the will where a
secret spring released the sliding panel.
The girl pressed it, and fell forward in a
swoon. Next morning she was found
there, with a scared face and the Missing
Will, which proved, of course, that the
ancestral mansion was really the property
of her young man. Scores of writers have
hired me for this iob, and I 've always
given complete satisfaction. Now and then
my line was to terrify the villain and cause
him to confess. But for my assistance in
this way, the story could never have been
ended at all! But I. always succeeded: no
one ever cave a villain a worse kind of fits
than I did. Then I could gibber. Now,
it isn't every ghost that can Bibber really
well, I assure you. Also I may add, that
none is better at the clanking-chain busi-
ness than myself. In fact, I was a ghost
whom the public loved, and upon whom
the writers felt that they could rely.
Alas! For some reason which I cannot
understand, my work has fallen off la-
mentably of late. Each year for some time
past my services have been less in demand,
and—strictly between ourselves—this Au-
tumn J. have not had a /tingle engagement.
Most of the Christmas numbers have
already appeared, the rest will follow in
a few days, but not one writer in them
has offered me a .iob. Could there be
blacker ingratitude for many years of faith-
ful service? There was indeed one excep-
tion; a young novelist did ask for my
assistance, and though he wasn't by any
means a leading man, I agreed to help him
through with his story. One can't afford
to he particular in these dreadful days.

Governess. "Now, LIXSUEY, YOU MUSTN'T HAVE ANY MOKE FH:M-PUDDI.NU. IT'LL
MAKE YOU ILL!" Linsley. "NEVER MIND, IT'S WOKF IT!"
Imagine my disgust when, having obtained
a post at last, the story was returned to
my employer by a brutal editor, with the
following insulting note, "No thanks.
Spooks are 'off'!" "Spooks are off," in-
deed I I ask you, Sir, is that a proper way
to speak of an old-established and highly
respectable ghost like myself?
And so, Sir, I venture to appeal to you.
Your sympathetic heart will feel for me;
you will pity, I am sure, a spectre who has j
seen better nights, and is now out of work
through no fault of his own. If you can't
yourself find a job fpr me, may I ask you
to recommend me to your friends P They
won't regret employing me; they will find
me as punctual and energetic as ever; and
surely the public has not lost all liking
for its old favourite?
For obvious reasons, I will not append
my name. If, as I trust, you wish to nelp
me, kindly let me wait on you in your
office at midnight.
THIS CORRESPONDENCE MUST
NOW CEASE.
IN vain, O Tailor, you expend
Your penny stamps. In vain you send
Letters persuasive, letters short,
Letters that threaten County Court,
Letters cajoling, that repeat

I tell you, Tailor, 'tis in vain,
I 'm down upon my luck again;
Have you none others you can fleece?
This correspondence must now cease.
No longer, MABEL dear, from you
Must I receive these billfts doux,
No longer must you summon me
To lunch a deux. It must not be.
For now your husband—oh! no doubt
He's bald and middle-aged and stout,
And dull and prosy; still, you see,
You married him and jilted me,

DARBY JONES ON LINGFIELD.
HONOURED SIR, -I trust, like Charon,
you are going merrily over the “Sticks.”
This quip is not mine own, but a Replica
of a jape uttered by your friend Sir
FRAISER PUNNETT, whom I encountered the
day before yesterday in Great Portland
Street, filled with a Piscatorial Dish which
he had just consumed at a Pagan Eating-
house in the immediate neighbourhood.
This Delicacy, so the Eminent and Jocose
Baronet informed me, is a native of Mar-
seilles, is called Bouillabaisse (I trust that
I have the correct caligraphy), was cele-
brated by the great W. MAKEPEACE
THACKERAY in verse, and, as Sir FRAISER
declared, “though fishy, will not poisson-
us” (Anglo-Gallic jest registered by Sir
F. P.).
After this bon mot, Sir FRAISER (doubtless
inspired by the Bouillabaisse in question)
asked me, on what racecourse in England
a fish-preserve was kept by a Poultryman ?
Being no Soothsayer with regard to
Sphinxes, I was unable to solve the Conun-
drum, which Sir FRAISER somewhat un-
feelingly left me to consider on the muddy
side-walk, while he deposited his Exqui-
sitely Varnished Boots in a Hansom Cab.

trouble. His staff has been almost as-

venture, fairly represents the general
tencur; though of the adjoining solutions
of the triple enigma each betrays a distinct
and poignant individuality.
DEAR Ma. PCNCH,—I note that my Daily
Chronicle is 'very vezed with the Daily
Mail for its cynical enterprise; though
with customary impartiality it consents to
allow a life-size advertisement of the pro-
jected plebiscite to appear in its own
generous columns. Myselfj as a True
Liberal, I shrink from committing myself
in a notoriously Conservative organ. Yet,
keen dog that I am, I yearn to throw
off the muzzle; to defeat that journalistic
conspiracy of silence which has lain like
a pall on the still lively corpse of Radi-
calism. But where shall I find a fitting
vent for my cooped-up feelings? It is to

medium of Liberal Conservatism: so please

Figaro in London, we select a few brief
notices at haphazard: —
"Wantrley has been brought out at Covent
Garden, and went off amid the snores of a very
quietly disposed audience."—Octohcr 27, 1832.
Relying on tradition and on the sur-
viving popularity, even to the present day,

"On, Miss BROWN, I WAS so SORRY I DIDN'T SEE YOU WHEN YOU CALLED THE OTHEK
DAY. I HAD SUCH A DREADFUL HEADACHE, THAT I HAD TO TELL MY MAID I WAS NOT AT
HOME TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS. BUT OF COURSE I SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOU I"
of the music in Midas, we had always
been under the impression that that piece
was in its day a great favourite with every-
body. So it might have been with most
persons, but not with Figaro in London,
who in his number for October 6, 1832,
says: —
"We forgot last week to notice Miss FBROC SON'S
appearance a« Apollo in that heap of trash, Midas."
"That heap of trash " 1 No mincing phrase
there.
In Figaro for August 18 the same year
is a notice of Mr. KKKLEY, whose name is
associated, in the recollection of the oldest
playgoer (pace Mrs. KEET.F.Y, who is still
alive and hearty), only with comedy and
farce. He is mentioned as—
"enacting Shy lock (at the Strand) for his own
benefit, but certainly not for the benefit of those
who witnessed it."
We, not having been either thought of or
born at the above date, can only suppose
that Mr. KEELEY had not then achieved
the exceptionally high position in his pro-
fession that he afterwards attained.
The appearance of a French daucer, who
subsequently achieved celebrity as a melo-
dramatic actress, is thus politely and plea-
santly described: —
"In bounced Mademoiselle CELESTR, the star of
the night, an old woman apparently of about fifty
years of age, dressed in a yery short blue petticoat.
The old lady capered away for some minutes with a
force frightfully muscular," &c., &c.. "while ehe
occasionally gave a spin of such endurance that at
the moment one might have fancied her di- top of
her profession."
Then follows what in these more delicate
times would have most certainly brought
down on both Proprietor and Editor an
action for libel; but as we have not come
across any subsequent allusion to such a
very natural consequence, it follows that
the professionals of those days did not con-
sider themselves injured by this style of
attack, and BO the Figaro continued its
bitterly satirical course through the years
of what may he termed "the terribly plain-
speaking thirties."

which will be of considerable interest to all Etonians, especially
to those "Old Boys" who may still remember the "Montem,"
which gave its last performance about half a century ago, on
which occasion Etonians in fancy costumes used to stop the
roaches and carriages on the King's Highway and demand
'salt" (money in any form) from the occupants. Such
a custom was an admirable preparation for any lad
with a natural turn for " the road," as had WILLIAM PARSONS,
who, commencing with petty thefts at Eton, finished "per varios
casus, per tot (dia)crimina," at Tyburn. Barry Lyndon was
nut "in it" with this amiable Etonian. In " Upper School" are
preserved busts of the Etonian Worthies. 'Why not set apart

And loosed his morion and chared his chin

So like an extinct mammoth lay the Chief;
Not like that HARCOUBT who, from head to

Let off his Budget underneath the eyes
Of gracious ladies beaming through the

Then loudlv called the doleful Jean
1'Honnete
For ink and plume, and took his scroll and
wrote:
"O my dear HARCOURT, what are we to do?
For lo! the former times are now defunct
When every day produced some gallant
scheme
For riding out to tilt at human wrones—
The TTnion, oor the Church, or else the
Drink—
And every scheme some gallant lance to
run it.
Such times have not been since our errant
knights
Took shnme of wearing shamrock in their

And now the whole BOUND TABLE breaketh
up,
And on its legs the heathen hack their

And I, the last of all thv true Elect,
As in a dim-brown studv I am left
To write the record of the davs that were."
He ceased, and made a cony for the Press,
And on the fallen warrior's failing heart
Pinned the original: and so with pain
Over the side, fearfully clinqinc, dropped.
Then slowly murmured HARCOURT from
the car:
"The pood old order changeth; ay, per-

It was too large an order—who shall say?
For men may have too much of one good

Therefore I go; I have done my work, and

That men may learn the worth of what

He ended, having finished. Then the

And looking each on other slowly winked.

Deep-pondering stood at gaze, until the car

Then, turning through the Forest, wearily

DUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
Dickens and his Illustrators (GEOBGB REDWAY), by FEED. G.
KirroN. It is not merely to " students of DICKENS " that this admir-
ably-produced book will appeal, but to all who take an interest in
the works of such illustrators as GEOBOE CRUIKHHANK, B. SBY-
MotrE, Hablot K. Browne, JOHN LEECH, MARCUS STONE, R.A.,
LUKB FnjDES. R.A., DICKY DOYLE, Sir JOHN TENNIEL, CI/ARKSON
STANFIELD, R.A., Sir EDWIN LANDSEER, R.A., GBOBGB CATTEB-
MOLB, and other good names, of which the least known is that of
ROBERT BASS, who seems to have been generally successful except
in the few illustrations he was, on SEYMOUR'S death, called upon to
do for Pickipiek. To the Baron's thinking, no one, on the whole,
illustrated DICKENS, that is, pourtrayed the figures that DICKENS
intended, so well as did " PHIZ." Farcical, burlesque, outrageously
«o occasionally, yet the figures (such, for example, as Mitawbtr)
were only Dickens out-Dickens'd. Yet, are not the novelist's eccen-
tric creations imprinted indelibly on our memory through the
medium of their representations by "PHIZ " P Perhaps after a
t»rm of uninterrupted collaboration, DICKENS came unconsciously
to create the types that "PHIZ" could most successfully draw.
Then, of JOHN LEECH'S illustrations to the Christmas books, how
memorable are his Trotty Veck and Tilly Slowboy! The Baron
has before him the first edition of The Haunted Man, with
five illustrations by "J. TBNNIEL," five by LEECH, three by
STANFIBLD, R.A., and two by FRANK STONE. The delightfully-
fantastic yet graceful frontispiece and illustrated title are "very
Tenniel." One would think twice before allowing a playful
Kitton to remain in a library; but there can be no doubt in the
mind of any Dickensian student as to the propriety, if not neces-
sity, of giving this particular Kitton a place on an accessible
shelf as soon as possible.
"That's rayther a sudden null up, ain't it, Sammyt" which
being old Mr. Welter's inquiring criticism on Nam's love-letter,
is very much what th« Baron would observe, without the
"Sammy," to Mr. W. W. JACOBS, after reading almost any one
of his capitally-told rtoriea in his volume entitled Sea Urehint
(LAWRENCE AND BULLEN). To which Mr. W. W. JACOBS would
simply reply, with Sam Wdler. "Not a bit on it; she'll viah
there wos more, and that's the great art o' letter writin'."
And, substituting "short story" for "letter," the Baron, on
consideration, is fain to admit that Mr. JACOBS would be quite
right. Yet his stories are so humorously tantalising, he tells
you so much, and that much so well, that when they break off
suddenly and you part with the characters, never to see or hear
of them again, the reader experiences a sense of _loss; he
returns over the ground, searching carefully to see if he has
missed anything, and finding that he has not, he goes on to tb*»
next story, expecting that this fresh one at least will amuse and
interest him as much as have those he has already read, and will
also satisfy his curiosity in regard to the future of the individuals
in whom he is sure to become interested. But the stories sa
they are finished or unfinished, are all good; not- an indifferent
one in the whole lot. For choice, the Baron would select "The
Smoked Skipper," "The Cabin Passenger," "Choice Spirits,"
and "Brother Hutchins." But, capital as these are, " The Grey
Parrot" "takes the cake." This troublesome bird, on account
of his impolite language, strong even for a parrot, is put in an
out-of-the-way room, where, "with a cloth thrown over its
cage," it "spent most of its time wondering when the days were
going to lengthen a bit." There's a dash of tragedy in_ one
story, but it soon merges into comedy, and "An Intervention"
—a most original incident—ends in a quiet chuckle. The col-
lection of stories must be bracketed with the same author's
Many Cargoes, and they would be hard to beat even if "Boz"
were with us to give a fresh series of his " sketches."
Of A History of the Dreyfus Case (SiMPKiN, MARSHALL,
HAMILTON, KENT & Co.), by GEORGE BARLOW, I need only say
that those who wish to know the wretched and tragic story of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
KITCHENER.
(In the metrt of Mr. George Meredith's Poems, recently published.)
BACK to the Soudan, tun-smitten, calorific, seorchant,
Oonel
Far from the quenchless, tenant town-councils, no longer amort,
Persistent to harry liis leisure, immeasurably scant,
With receptions reperoussent and addresses adulatant, or some*
thing of the sort;
Far from dinners, magnanimous, galopshns stodge;
Far from orators, catastrophic, gurglant, glummering om,
Some mumble, with hesitations murmurant,
Some, fluent with indefinite jaw-cackle, prank,
All glaucous and tommyrottant;
Far from redundent busybodiea difficult to dodge.
Oh, my eye, after such a fling,
What paradisiacal peaceful ness in the increscent, arenaceous
deserts, which flank
The equinoctial ups of the Nile!
There, later on, in the College, cumulative, quenchlew, of the
SIRDAR,
Highcockalorumjig hip hip hurrah Panjandrum,
The inconscient, tenebrious blackamoors
Will learn
The English tongue.
Not, let us fervently desiderate, the English of CABLTLI,
Bogglant, Teutonic, repellent hoot* glum,
Jaw-gapes athwart booming far,
Ridged up for boors;
Nor yet the English of KIPLINO^
Lambent with exotic gabble-quirk*,
In a "Madrissa for Hubshees,
A College for Soudanese, dolorous, decrescent, nigeroua, young;
No I
Not the English of KIPLTNO, who make* "fourth" rhyme with
"worth,"
And "men" with "again "; evocative jerks I
What on earth
Made him do it? Neither of these,
Nor yet the graceless, unapt English of the crowd,
Of the braggart butcher, the bodeful baker, or the calamitous
candlestick-maker,
Of the scornful omnibus-conductor,
Staggerant in the spirally upward of the omnibus steps.
Of the stockbroker, wnite-waistcoated, declamant, penetrant,
loud,
Of the tolerant tinker,
Of the triumphant, tenant, towering tailor;
No!
They ought to learn that immaroessible English,
Clarion, equipollent, succourful,
Clamant as the magnanimous ballyrag when cabbage-stalks spurn,
Veridical as the adolescent hippopotamus,
Voicing the delinquent chimney-pots forthwith,
Grumous as fried fish,
Rumpling lapis lazuli boomerang electro-plated bull
Mountainous brain-awake friable malignant omnibus;
That is what the Soudanese must learn—
The English of GEORGE MEREDITH.
CLOWN IN FTJTURO.
A Voice from the Juniors.—Now that we are within measurable
distance of Boxing Night, it is just as well that it should be
understood that the young do not require any of the so-called
"childish fun" of our ancestors. The clown is out of date,
and no boy or girl cares a fig about the clumsy inanities of the
Pantaloon. What we of the rising generation desire is beautiful
scenery, interesting and expensive dresses, and lots of intricate
dancing. What can there be amusing in a person with a red
patched face making a butter-slide for the discomfort of some
score of wretched supers P Dancing may help our sisters how to
comport themselves at a ball, and an effective spectacle may
satisfy the cravings for the aesthetic of our brothers. And then
let the portion of the entertainment intended for the younger
members of the audience commence at a reasonable hour—say
nine o'clock. Then, after the play is over, the boys and girls
can go either to the club for bones and a smoke, or the boudoir
for a soup and a chatter. Not that I admit myself to be a boy,
as I am forced to sign myself A FOSSIL OF FIFTEEN.
A Voice from the Seniors.—I really must protest against the
idea that seems to be gaining ground that people who have come
to years of discretion want to see dancing and scenery. All
that sort of thing may do fairly well for our descendants.

LINKS.
Gertie (to Cousin, a btyinner). "AND WHY DO THEY CALL THE BOYS
'CADDIES'!"
Cmain. "OH—ER—BECAUSE—BR—DON'TCHER KNOW, THE 'CADDIE'
HOLDS THE 'TEE.'" Gertie. "OH—H—H—H!"
What we want is the drollery of the red-hot poker. There is
nothing pleasing in watching a lady—who is old enough to know
better—walking about the stage on the largest of her toes. And
as for stage cloths, don't we know that they have a seamy side,
and that all is not gold that glitters? The fun of our old friend
the Christmas Clown is always vastly entertaining. If any one is
to be cut out, let it be Columbine, with her pointless posing.
No; let us have plenty of " spill and pelt." And as for the time,
let our portion of the pantomime come reasonably early—say
seven. A dinner at five, and bed well before ten is tne
rational regime, of the seniors. Then, even those who admit to
be elderly, will enjoy what is known as " beauty's sleep." Not
that I admit I am aged, as I beg to sign myself,
A CHILD or SEVENTY.
WHAT! Orm OLD FRIEND SMITH?—Perennial TOM SMITH!
Crackers again!" Artistic Crackers," "Toy Crackers," "Man-
darin Crackers," "Blossom Whispers," and varieties of all sorts
of Crackers, except nut-crackers! Evidently TOM draws the
line here, that is, for this year, as the omission having been
pointed out to him, TOM SMITH will puzzle his "nut" in de-
vising some entirely new sort of cracker for the end of the cen-
tury, to equal which will be the despair of future TOM BROWNS,
TOM JONESES, and TOM ROBINSONS. As the convivial chorus
goes: —
Here '• to yon, TOM SMITH,
Here 'a to you, with all our heart.
But what the rest of it is—substituting "BROWN" for "SMITH,"
in the original—we are at a loss to recollect; only, onoe upon a
time, it was a chorus which evoked sentiments of eternal friend-
ship—late, very late, in the evening.
FROM "GOLDEN LANE."—This sounds quite a Fairy Locality,
where dwells the Fairy FAULKNER, from whom Mr. Punch has
received delightful specimens of his magic in the shape of Christ-
mas cards, pictures, almanacks, and other faerie fancies. There
are very pretty diaries, which make the year look gay through-
out; there are eccentric games and cards of all sorts, pretty,
plain, comic, but always the "Correct Cards" for Christmas.

GIVING HERSELF AWAY.
Mistress. "JANE, I 'VE MISLAID THE KEY OF MY ESCRITOIKE. I WISH YOU 'D JUST FETCH
ME THAT BOX OF ODD KEYS. 1 DARESAY I CAN FIND ONE TO OPES IT."
Jane. "IT 's NO USE, MA'AM. THJSRE ISN'T A KEY IN THE 'OusE AS 'LL FIT THAT DESK."
A MERRY CHRISTMAS 1
"A MEKKY Christmas!"—Yes, I know
How blandly people smile to hear
That good old phrase of long ago—
It is so smart (and bard) to sneer!
That Christmas now 's a cheerful pose,
Good will to men and Christian charity
Exploded myths, each baby knows,
And learns to crow with forced hilarity.
Your youthful cynic, rising two,
Turns up his nose at Santa Claus;
At three, the childish joys are few
He fails to damn with faint applause.
At four—the blas£ age of fqur—
He finds the pantomime detestable,
Bran-pies and Christmas-trees a bore,
Plum-pudding even indigestible.
So he grows up, all joys and griefs
Dissecting with a cynic knife,
Destroying all the old beliefs,
And losing half the salt of life.
Worst of all modern ills I hold
This cheapening of childhood's treasures,
This reckless hurry to grow old
And slay with sneers youth's simple
pleasures.
"A Merry Christmas!"—You and I
Can .greet without a sneering tongue—
I pray that as the years go by
They find your heart and mine still young.
"Grey head on shoulders green " to-day
Commands the applause of all beholders,
Yet more to be desired, I say,
Is a green heart beneath grey shoulders!
As in the Western Hemisphere,
So in the map of Life are seen
Two continents—one green, one sere—
With a long isthmus in between.
And all mankind, both great and small,
Both good and bad, both dull and clever,
One stage a year are journeying all,
And journeying Southward, downward,
ever.
Some never reach the isthmus, some
Their steps far South beyond it bend—•
Yet all men, oome whate'er may come,
With hearts still young their course may
end.
I, having passed my thirtieth stage,
Not yet half way across the isthmus
That joins the Lands of Youth and Age,
Can wish you still—"A Merry Christ-
mas!"

THE MAD MULLAH INTERVIEWED.
OUR special correspondent succeeded in
obtaining an interview with the Mad Mul-
lah recently, and sends us the following : —
Chakdara, Monday.
I found the Mad Mullah seated on an
inverted egg-chest, pensively chewing a
straw. He nodded as I entered his tent,
and said, "Be seated. There 's plenty of
room on the floor." Then, after a pause,
he added, "Bismillah! Allah is great and
Mahomet is his prophet."
I replied, "Yes, so they say. What do
you think of affairs in the Swat valley?"
"Oh! I shall go out of the Mad Mullah
business," he answered, rather despairingly.
"Nothing to be made in it nowadays.
Think of turning it into a limited com-
pany. Could you give me an introduction
to HOOLBY, or ROCKER, or any of those
chaps? You see, if the public would intro-
duce some capital, I feel sure that there
would be some proph—profits, I mean—at
all events for us, it not for the common or
garden investor! But at present, the out-
look's discouraging. Flight is my strong
card, just now. Of course, I'm worth a
good bit to English editors hard up for
copy. Always good for an eight-line par,
'Flight of the Mad Mullah,' or 'Another
Outbreak by the Mad Mullah'; but mostly
they're 'flights' now. Game's getting a
bit played out though, and if HOOLEY or
the other fellow will take me up, I '11 cer-
tainly sell out of the business at once.

A BALLADE OF CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
THE joy of Christmas shopping I Now
The world goes daily forth, I see,
With busy steps and serious brow,
To shop from early morn to tea.
People, as swift the hours flee,
From shop to shop untiring wend,
I too must buy—some two or three—
The presents which I have to send.
And, since to Custom I must bow,
I storm the Stores with chastened glee—
But let me, oh, my friends, avow
One proposition frank and free!
Old Masters, jewels, lands in fee,
Which might to you themselves com-
mend,
(For reasons of mere £ s. d.)
Are presents which I do not send!

With meerschaum fine (his weird hell
dree!);
Books, toys, and go on—and somehow
My Christmas shopping's done, D. G.

How glad!—" my little all " to spend,
Remains, alas! by Fate's decree,
A present which I shall not send.

THE RIVAL ROMEOS AND THE OFTEN-DESERTED JULIET.
The Old Party will probably not be in too great a hurry to make her Choice.
OXFORD, 2000 A.D.
[" The Midland University, which is being formed at Birmingham, will, in
one respect, be quite unique amongst the Universities of Great Britain, for it
hu been decided to establish in connection with it a school of brewing.
There will be « chair of brewing, and the training will be of the fullest. . . .
A special brewing laboratory will be established contiguous to the University
buildings."— Weitmintter (/aztttt.]
ON reading the above, Mr. Punch was seriously perturbel.
What about Oxford and Cambridge? How would they stand I
such competition? Would they be cut out of the field by their!
up-to-date rival? Obviously there was but one way to answer
these questions, and accordingly 211 r. Punch't Special Prophetic
Interviewer was despatched to the Isis.
At the first glimpse it was obvious that, whatever else had
happened, Oxford was not deserted. Great changes had, how-!
ever, been effected. The spires and towers had all disappeared,:
and in their place rose a forest of tall chimneys. The S. P. I.;
made his way to Christ Church, which indeed he had some diffi-
culty in recognising. Tom Quad and the Cathedral had been
pulled down to make room for a huge red-brick building, whence
issued a continuous stream of brewers' drays driven by under-
grads in cap and gown. The S. P. I. entered. A large audience
were listening to Dr. VATZ, the Dean, who was lecturing on the
Chemistry of Bitters, samples of which were handed round the
class at frequent intervals. It appeared to be a very popular
lecture. At its conclusion the 8. ]P. I. presented himself to the
Dean, who kindly volunteered as cicerone.
"Great changesf" remarked the Dean. "No doubt there
are. Why, in your time, there wasn't even a chair of Brewing.
This I'K the Bottling Department. Most of the undergraduates
here are Freshmen. That man in the scholar's gown? He is
one of our most promising students, and has already taken the
Hertford and Ireland. No," added the Dean, smiling indulgently
at the S. P. I.'s ignorance, "these are no longer classical scho-
larships. They are given for Malting and Brewing."
"Then is beer the only profession now taught in Oxford?"
"By no means. In Balliol they make whisky, in All Soles,
boots and shoes, and so forth. But here we don't do much but
brewing. Christ Church is still the aristocratic college, you
know. Even in your time brewers were a majority of the House
of Lords—not a majority? Well, a big percentage, at all events."
"And classics?"
The Dean laughed. "Of course, the old regime died hard.
Balliol was the Pioneer of the new Oxford Movement, and when
she first put up her whisky laboratory. Convocation and Congre-
gation protested to a curate. But the change had to come. Bir-
mingham was beating us everywhere. The aristocracy were all
going there, and Birmingham Bachelors of Brewing and Doctors
of Distilling were getting every post in the country worth
having."
"And what about the women?"
"Of course, the New Movement affected them too. Somer-
ville is now a steam-laandry with a mangling laboratory, and
Lady Margaret's is a school of cookery where they read for
degrees in the domestic arts. But I must be off, cried the
Dean, "to visit the fermenting bins, or the Freshmen will be
poisoning themselves with the carbonic acid. Before you leave
Oxford, you should run round and see the improvements at the
Ashmolean. It used to be a library, usedn't it P Now it's the
University Co-operative Stores, where undergraduates do their
practical work for the shopwalkers' degree."
R» the S. P. I. returned to town, satisfied that Oxford will
hold her own with her pushful younger sister.

Off St. Vincent. Thursday.—Ova Captain
is a wonderful man. He can not only sail
a ship, but can tell to sixty seconds when
•he will begin to roll.
WHKI.EU is hU name,
England is bis nation,
St. Albans U bin country borne,
To see it his salvation.
That doesn't happen often in the. year,
a circumstance that gives him fuller
opportunity of studying the phenomenon
alluded to.
Sitting down to dinner at 7 o'clock just
as we were rounding Cape St. Vincent, the
ship that bad borne nerself so serenely
through the fabled turmoil of the Bay of
Biscay suddenly began to roll in a fashion
that impartially distributed the soup.
Noted on entering saloon that the fiddles
were on the table. (The gentlemen of
England who live at home at ease, and
never dine to the accompaniment of the
fiddle, must understand that nothing
musical is meant. The framework tempo-
rarily attached to the saloon dining-tables
in order to keep dishes, glasses and bottles
from flying about is called the fiddle, be-
cause it in no way resembles a violin.)
Appearance ominous, but the state of the
weather on deck did not justify apprehen-
sion. In a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, the soup just served was flying about
the cabin like an April shower, only more
unctious.
"Ah 1" said the Captain, as if that were
nothing, "in half an hour we '11 have an-
other round."
The ship settling down as suddenly as
she 'd erupted, the dinner went merrily on
till, just as the game was being served, a
similar earthquake swooped down on the
cabin. The birds, after their kind, adroitly
seized the opportunity to take to them-
selves wings and fly away into convenient
bosoms and laps. With one consent we
took out our watches, and found it was
twenty-four minutes to eight.
"Urn I" said the Captain, gloomily, "I 'm
a minute out. It was just five minutes
past seven when 1 spoke."
The warning was accurate enough for
these seated at the Captain's table. A
little hard upon passengers at otiiers. 11
observation nas reduced the matter to a
precise science, why not utilise tne menu
lor giving timely notice P In rounding
Cape St. Vincent, the snip's course is twice
changed, momentarily creating ructions.
Why should not the menu run thus : —
Potage a la Keiue.
Ructions it la Neptune.
The rest of the menu is calculated to take

And vent his spleen and humour bitter,
In scorn of joyful Christmas ciieer,
Calling its pleasures empty glitter;
Such churlish thoughts thougu nis may be,
It is not so with you and me.
You have no thought of coming pain
To darken your delights witn sadness,
Your carol is a joyous strain,
Your life is but one hymn of gladness;
I catch a ray of gladness, too,
My PHYLLIS, when I think of you.
Nay, there is joy at Christmas still,
And youth and purity can buy it,
Although the world be harsh and cnill;
Yes, you at least will not deny it,
PHYLLIS, for—sober truth to say—
You were not born hist Christmas Day.
SOME CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
Or Consolation Prizes, as the case may be.
FOB Sir William Horcourt—the head of
the^ editor of the Daily Mail on a charger.
For the German Emperor—an invitation
to dine with the New Vagabonds.
For President Kruger—an invitation to
stop away.
For M. Delcaase—a packet of safety pins.
For Sir E. Monson—a packet of soft soap.
For Mrs. Druoe—a subscriber or two for
her "Portland Bonds."
For the above subscriber or two—free
lodgings, board and attendance sine die in
Hanwell, that is, if they ever expect to see
a termination of the case.
For the Sirdar—the opportunity to give
Major Marchand the opportunity to sub-
scribe to the Gordon College at Khartoum.
For Major Marchand—the opportunity
to accept this opportunity.
For the Emperor of China—a passport
for a perambulator-ride outside the Palace
of Peking.
For the Dowager-Empress of China—a

A BACHELOR UNCLE'S DIARY,
i.
Monday.— Have seen nothing of my
relatives since that terrible visit of MAX
and TOMMY to Shrimpton in September.
My dear sister CONSTANCE, their mother,
sends me muffin-dish. Hate muffins, terri-
bly indigestible; but still, so kind. AU-
GUSTA presents me with barrel of oysters.
So delicious, but never eat oysters for fear
of typhoid. None the less thoughtful of
her. Must do something in return.
Might send them each a box of cigars or
No, the very thing! invite them and their
husbands and elder children to dine on
Christmas Day. Will word invitation
warmly. Well, not too warmly, in case
they prefer to refuse. Say 6 P.M. dinner.
Delightful (rather) to renew acquaintance
with MAX and TOMMY—for a short time.
And they may all refuse. I hope—not.
Thursday.—Received replies accepting.
AUGUSTA writes that, as head nurse has
holiday that day, she is sure I won't mind
her bringing TOPST and WILLIE, the two
younger children. Charmed, of course;
at least, I think so.
Christmas Day.—Morning church, peace
and goodwill, and a forty-five minutes con-
stitutional afterwards. Luncheon, sole a la
Colbert, cold grouse, and just a glass and a
half Chateau Yquem. Cigar and the
Field. Usual doze by fire just commencing,
when sound of wheels causes heart to sink.
Listen intently. Yes. No. It's only
three o'clock. They can't possibly
THEY HAVE!!!
Dear AUGUSTA and five darlings
(AUGUSTA'S phraseology, this) sweep into
room, bringing with them the freshness of
health and an icy draught. "Thought you
wouldn't mind, CHARLBY, if we came rather
earlier "—-she said " rather earlier "—" than
you asked us. We 'd promised our coach-
man a holiday, so determined to come over
early, and let him get back to enjoy his
afternoon. He'll fetch us at ten. Now,
don't you disturb yourself. Go on smoking
your pipe" (disgusting habit, smoking
pipes! Why mistake my Cabana for pipe?
So hurtful), "and the children will just
amuse themselves here in your room.
Here, TOPSY." Gives TOPSY cherished
small Dresden figure to play with. I
writhe. "Now, WILLIE, you 're not to
touch that nasty cat "—my blue Persian—
"leave its tail alone, at once. Here 's
something to amuse you; may he have
this little carriage-clock to play with,
CHARLEY?" Say I would rather he played
with something else, the coals in the
scuttle, for instance. AUGUSTA contemns
the Wallsend as playthings. "Oh! here,
this will do!" she says, snatching up cigar-
box, and handing out a dozen or so of my
choice Cabanas to dear WILLIE. (N.B.—
AUGUSTA'S husband a non-smoker.) Feel
that I could cheerfully sing, " Willie, vx
hare missed you." Bright, breezy creature,
AUGUSTA. Other three children sit in a
row, staring at me. Keep wary eye on
TOPSY and WILLIE, and wonder how many
of those cigars will be worth smoking when
WILLIE has done with them. D-—ear
WILLIE!
Violent, or suppose I should say hearty,
slap on back announces brother-in-law's
arrival. AUGUSTA'S husband, Dr. PILLING-
TON, has aggressive air of hail-fellow-well-
met, and punctuates his remarks with acts
of personal violence. "How are you,
CHARLES?" Poke in ribs. ''Putting a
leetle too much on here." Dig at waist-
coat. So rude. Shall hate this man di-
rectly. "Had a case of the sort 6nce
where my patient AUGUSTA, TOPST is
swallowing that Chinese coin. Yes, had a
case " Awful choking fit by TOPSY
demands immediate attention, and I
escape, saying I have to. "see a man."
Rush downstairs and implore housekeeper
to hurry on dinner. Says quite impossible.
Besides, what about other guests? Had
forgotten that. Go to stables and smoke
cigar. Return 5.30, and find dear CON-
STANCE and the General, with MAX and
TOMMY, just arrived.
"Good old Uncle CHARLEY, you must be
glad to see us again!" says MAX. So
hearty. Thump on back from TOMMY.
"Won't it be fun!" So homely. Feel I
have done nothing to deserve this. MAX
takes me aside confidentially. "I Ve
brought you a white rat with pink eyes,
Uncle CHARLEY, for a Christmas present,
but I 'm Mowed if I can find it! I—I think
I must have slipped it into the Governor's
greatcoat pocket instead of my own, and—
Oh, by gum! there he goes!" Rat dashes
across hall. CONSTANCE screams. General
swears. Boys and butler chase. Merci-
fully, my terrier pounces on it, and with
one snap rids me of this embarrassing gift.
Calm down, and General says, "I hope
you 've not asked PILLINGTON, CHARLEY?
You have? Well, I'll be hanged. You
know I never will meet that feller if
I can help it. It's too bad!" Glares at
me. Why me? Apologise. Frigid greet-
ing between PILLINGTON and General.
Awful twenty minutes, and then dinner
announced.
So Economical.
First Lady Churchgoer. Isn't it curious
that Christmas D.ay should fall on a Sunday
this year?
Stennd Lady Churchgoer (who has made
contribution suffice for the two days). Very;
but not, I think, so quaint as that, after
Christmas falling on a Sunday, New Year's
Day should follow suit. Why shouldn't
this happen every year?
Q. What is the difference between
Christmas on shore and Christmas at sea?
A. One is spent among the crackers, the
other among the breakers.

FIGURES.
(By the Ever-Beady Reckoner.)
FIGURES are wonderful things, and would
bo more marvellous still were it not for the
intrusion of facts.
There is something weird and uncanny
about figures. By their means! one can
make the most abstruse calculations, such
as, if a herring and a half cost three half
pence, how much half a dozen herrings will
cost. Nor is this all; by means of figures
one can prove almost anything.
The cynic declares that "every man has
his price," which may be true of most of
us, and we know, of course, that every
woman has her figure, and most of them
are proud of it.
Abolish figures, and you do away with
company promoters and managers of bur-
lesque theatres at one blow.
Every company is floated. That is the
technical term, derived, no doubt, from
the fact that most of the shareholders are
altogether " at sea " as to the real prospects
of the company. But I digress. Every
company, then, is started with a pretty set
of figures, showing that the profits of the
undertaking will be enormous, and the
chances of a loss so infinitesimal as to be
scarcely worthy of consideration.
When the company is formed, and the
promoters have modestly and discreetly
retired from the concern with their profits,
certain facts thrust themselves forward
with the result that not infrequently a
pretty figure is cut by the shareholders,
especially when the company is one of
unlimited liability.
Numbers of pretty figures are to be seen
at our burlesque and other theatres where
light musical pieces are performed, and the
prettier the figures disporting on the stage,
the larger is the amount of the figures in
the manager's bank-book. This is a fact.

Now this it the road to Happiness--ye may make full sure of it,
If ye follow the rules of Tradition in the heart of the ptople writ.
For each mince-pie that the mouths of men take well and truly in,
Or ever the New Year's day shall dawn, one happy month they win;

JOHN ROBINSON bears him stoutly as a man untouched of Fate.
His glance is Youth, his smile is Joy, and Pride swings in his gait.
JOHN ROBINSON bears him lightly as a man who walks on air—
What is the virtue in him? Wisdom of Punch, declare!
He has won no soldier's laurel in the imminent deadly breach,
He has saved no drowning tripper off Margate's desolate beach;
He has stirred no soul with music, he has shed no printers' ink,
Wherewith the blind should be made to see, or unthinking folk
to think.
He has won no love of woman—a thing which is hard to beat
For making a man conduct himself as one who has bought the
street;
He has broken never a record by the might of his body or brain,
He has broken no shareholders in their simple search for gain;
He has not promoted companies, he has made no pile of cash,
Nor has he climbed or travelled, or achieved a social splash.
If he has gained no praises, so has he gained no blame,
Neither by truth nor lying has he made a Wide-world Name.
He has not rowed for Cambridge, he has stroked no Oxford eight,
He has not "run," and he has not "read," he is neither good
nor great;
He has snot no English bison, he has tickled no basking shark,
In fact, he has done no single thing that is really worth remark!

Yet does he well to lift a proud, if slightly bilious, eye—
Has he not wrestled and fought with and conquered his tu-elfth

'INTS ON 'UNTING, BY 'ARRY.
IP XT A MEET YOUR HORSE SHOULD GET A BIT OUT OF HAND, JUST RUN HIM UP AGAINST SOME ONE.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Baron's assistant has been reading Chitral: The Story of
a Minor Kitge (METHUEN & Co.), by Sir GEORGE S. ROBERTSON,
K.C.S.I., and reports to his chief: —There may be stories of
heroism and endurance and resource that can match this. I,
at any rate, know none that can surpass it. For this is, as the
children say, a real story. The men who figure in its pages, men
brave as the paladins of romance, are real men, the author him-
self, CAMPBELL, GUHDON, WHITCHURCH, HARLEY, TOWNSHEND,
and the rest of them. I don't wish to say anything disrespectful
about ACHILLES, HECTOR, and their companions, but it is certain
that some of them were selfish, others sulky, and all of them,
though their courage was unquestionable, bragged intolerably,
and invariably stopped their warfare to strip their fallen foe of
lu's armour. But the Englishmen of whom Sir GEORGE ROBERT-
SON speaks, held out against overwhelming odds, inspired their
lusky soldiery with their own simple unfaltering courage, led
forlorn hopes, outwitted oriental wiles, fought like Trojans or
Greeks, and never gave a thought to themselves. It is a noble
story nobly told, and stirs the reader's blood like the blast of a
trumpet. These men were not picked for their task by a careful
process of selection. Fortuitously brought together when the
storm burst upon them, they all seem to have been upheld and
ennobled by the same spirit of self-abnegation, cheerful devotion
:o duty, and heroic endurance. It gives one a higher sense of
:he greatness of one's birthright to reflect that they were
ordinary Englishmen casually ordained to the performance of
their great task, and fit to carry it through as they did just be-
cause they were Englishmen. Fortunately for them, and, above
ill things, fortunately for us, they have had in Sir GEORGE
ROBERTSON a rates saccr admirably equipped for relating their
story. Sir GEORGE is no military dry-as-dust, but a writer with
a wonderful gift for the simple narrative of brave deeds. His
writing swings along with a gallant movement, entirely in keep-
ng with the tale it tells. Every scene is so vividly depicted that
:he reader fancies himself present in the fort, listens with a
breathless anxiety to the strokes of the enemy's picks in the
mine, rushes with HARLEY on his sortie, or, again, beholds WHTT-
3HURCH supporting his stricken comrade, BAIRD, and stands with
Sir GEORGE beside BAIRD'S deathbed. It is a splendid book, and
worthily enshrines a splendid story.
One of the Baron's assistants reports as follows: —The Boot
of the "Cambridge Iteriew" (Cambridge: MAOMII.I.AN AND
BOWES), is a selection of prose and verse gathered from the
columns of the Cambridge Iteriew, from 1879 up to the present
year. Such a selection from a University journal, if it is to
justify its appearance in book form, must do so by its rerre, its
sprightliness, and its fun. These are the qualities traditionally
associated with University literature of the lighter kind. They
are to be found—the comparison may be odious, but it is in-
evitable—in Echoes from the "Oxford Magazine," the journal
which at Oxford holds a position analogous to that of the Rerifu
at Cambridge. But in The Hook of the "Cambridge Berinr"
these qualities are, I do not say entirely absent, but certainly
rare. The reader looks for parodv, and he comes upon a solid
article of useful information on Rowing in Greek Triremes."
He looks for humour and, lo, he is met with an account ot
"American Universities," excellent, no doubt, but not humorous.
This spirit of information at all costs pervades the prose. The
verse is lighter, but even in the verse there is an absence of the
true Cambridge sparkle, and the general effect of the little book
is, I grieve to say, somewhat stodgy. I may be told, of course,
that I look at it from a wrong point of view, that it does not
pretend to sparkle or lightness. If so, why should it have
been published at all? Cambridge can do and has done better
and more brilliant work than this in the field of light
literature.
Military Dialogues (SANDS & Co.), by Lieut.-Col. X. NEWNHAM
DAVIS, are decidedly very amusing, and had the author been
less conscientious in literally reproducing the language of Private
TOMMY ATKINS, the book would have been as irreproachable as
it is humorous. The dialogues are all short, but those carried
on by privates, more or less sober, and an occasional sergeant,
are not particularly sweet. "A Subaltern's Court-Martial"
conveys the notion that every sort of horse-play and tomfoolery
has not been banished from the service. "Superannuated" is
excellent, and there are genuine touches of nature in "Old
Soldiers" and "Mail Day." The Baron, being of opinion that
compression is the better part of humour, considers all the de-
scriptions of scene, of "business," and of dramatif prr.iOTur, are
considerably too long. The figure on the cover, drawn by R.
CATON WOODVILLE, is excellent. THE BARON DE B.-W.

HOBSON'S CHOICE.
[At Chicago the other day, Lieutenant HOBSON, of Santiago fame, kissed
one hundred and sixty-live girls in public lifter his lecture.—Haiti/ J'jpir.]
YOUNG HOBSON is the hero of the Merrimac affair,
Which clearly demonstrated that he 's pluck enough to spare;
But as things go, he '11 possibly regret the same exploit,
When finding that his work's cut out, from Texas to Detroit.
The feminine Amurrican cii ma-sir has gone for him,
Demanding each a chaste salute—was ever such a whim?
The other day eight score went home in patriotic bliss,
And swearing they will ne'er wash off the "Lewtenant's" late
kiss.
Whene'er he 's giv'n a lecture, the policemen make a lane,
And fair enthusiasts rush up their guerdon to obtain,
While homely damsels catch the rage, and won't he left behind:
It mayn't be quite respectable, but that they do not mind!
If this by now is HOBSON'S choice—this mormonising game
Of osculating silly girls by thousands into fame,
With countless jealous sweethearts he will have to settle scores,
Or wear a mask and muzzle when proceeding out of doors.
LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
(From ifr. Punch's Vagrant Coniribi/lor.)
To SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT.
MY DEAR SIH,—I wonder if in your pleasant retirement at
Malwood it is any satisfaction to you to reflect that you have not
only created wriat the daily guides of our public opinion call an
event of the gravest significance, but have also scattered confu-
sion and dismay through the incoherent mob of disaffected politi-
cians, some of whom it has been your privilege to lead? For my-
self, I think that the satisfaction, if you feel it (.and you would
be more than human if you did not), is largely mixed with a
genuine and painful regret. To see his counsels set at nought,
his principles derided, to have a pack of inflated mediocrities
yelping at his heels in order to drive him into paths which his
honour and the traditions of his past forbid him to tread, to be
made answerable for the disappointed ambitions of petty men
whose jealousies and querulous revilings make life intolerable, to
be compelled to assault the disciplined legions of an entrenched
enemy with a rabble, whom it would be affectation to look upon
as '' friendlies," to have to carry not only the burden of his own
mistakes, but the accumulated and well-nigh insupportable load
of the faults of others—that, Sir, would be for any one a terrible
situation. It is in plain words the situation that you have been
called upon to face. And there are circumstanceLS that must
have rendered it in a more than ordinary sense galling to you.
You are, you have always be*n, a fighter, a burly warrior de-
lighting in the clash of arms and the tumult of battle. In im-
agination it was easy to picture you clothed in ponderous mail,
and charging on the back of some gigantic heavy-hoofed war-
horse straight into the serried masse's of the foe. Other men
might shrink and grow pale, but you knew not fear: you flung
your heart into the centre of the hostile array and followed it
rejoicing. Thus you strove and worked: in good days your ex-
ample inspired your people, in adversity your high courage ant
your skill were at their service to rally them and help them to
pluck success from the overweening confidence of the enemy.
And now, old in years, no doubt, but still strong, active am
resourceful, witli all your brilliant record of action bravely car-
ried out through many tedious years, you find the hearts of your
folk estranged from you and you are forced to realise that, who-
ever henceforth may pluck renown by fighting at their head, yov
can do so no more, since loyalty and faith, the foundations of al
leadership, are lacking. And this must be, as I say, a bitter
realisation for you who, having fought a good fight manfully
have yet your share both of the pride and of the sensitiveness
that are proper to strong and manly natures.
How have these things come to pass? The answer is not easy,
but partly, I think, it may be found in the condition of oui
national temper. We are passing through a warlike and enthu-
siastic phase. We are no longer satisfied with the inward con-
sciousness of power, nor are we content with the serene demean-
our that suits that state of mind. Like our new friends, the
Americans, we feel that we must be up and doing, and the louder
our doings resound through the world the better are we pleased
No observer can have doubted before their strife with Spain
actually broke out that the immense majority of the American
people were eager for war, and that, had the war been prevented
they would have felt as though they had been defrauded. Too
long, they seemed to say, have we built up gigantic industria

enterprises, planned railroads, secured fortunes from enormous
"corners," bought and sold and lived and died ingloriously:
We who make pretence
At living on, and wake and eat and sleep,
And life's stule trick by repetition keep,
Our fickle permanence
(A poor leaf-shadow on a brook, whose play
Of busy idlesse ceases with our day)
Is the mere cheat of sense.
Thus their hearts seemed to speak, and so they rushed to
Santiago and laid down their lives.
DC nob is fabula. The old watchwords have lost their power.
Here and there some political hermit still cries out for peace,
retrenchment and reform, but few mark him and fewer still
applaud. We are to paint the map of Africa red; we are to
maintain the biggest navy in the world, aye, and use it too; we
are to stand no nonsense' from German Emperors, from French
Ministers, from Russian Czars, or from South African Presi-
dents. Is there a pith-helmeted soldier in sight? Let us salute
him with embraces and sentimental songs celebrating the heroic
prowess and the simple virtues of TOMMY ATKINS, the numerically
small but the eternally irresistible. Are we to enjoy the Christ-
mas number of an illustrated paper? Then let it give us, in a
highly-coloured supplement, at least one lurid picture of battle
and destruction. And as to the expense, why, the expense be
—neglected.
I am not arguing whether this state of feeling be praiseworthy
or not. I merely state facts which must be plain even to the least
observant. But in such an atmosphere you, Sir, are not at your
ease. Other traditions are yours, other principles have guided you,
and it may be that you find yourself neither sufficiently young noi
sufficiently compliant to trim your sails to this new popularit aura.
At anv rate, you retire from leadership—though I will not take
it upon myself to prophesy for how long the retirement may last.
For the political scene shifts with a bewildering rapidity, and
he would be a bold man who would deny that it is possible for
you to be flung back, even against your will, to power on some
wave of indignant protest, whether against high Church ritual or
against a supposed militarism and a perpetual territorial ex-
pansion.
But for the present we bid you farewell—as a leader. That
your vigorous strength and keen intelligence can ever resign
themselves to idleness, I for one am not willing to believe. This
truce of parties cannot last, and when the fight begins again, 1
know vou will not be absent wherever hard blows are to be struck
for the principles with which your life has so far been associated.
I am, Sir, with all respect, your faithful servant,
THE VAGRANT.

LONDON'S LATEST HEALTHFUL KLONDYKE.
—Golder's Hill.
THEIGEAUD TRUNK
IT matters not that people say
"Your Party has no head;
And simple trunks with this away
Are practically dead!"
Though chiefs are useful things, we know,
And 'tis with pain we sever,
Yet such may come and such may go.
But we roll on for ever!
It is, of course, a common plan
For one to take the lead,
And pointedly conduct the van
Upon a prancing steed;
Yet is he not of any use,
His raison d'etre is hollow,
Who cannot, now and then, induce
The rank and file to follow.
Now fortunately we possess
(How seldom this occurs!)
A singularly level mess
Ol' junior officers;
The claims of each to rule the rest—
Some shorter, others longer—
In strength are equal to the best,
Or even slightly stronger.
One holds that Britain's manly force
Is undermined by Beer,
And one would move without remorse
To purge the bloated Peer;
One thinks the navy ought to cope
With any sort of crisis;
Anothor planks his final hope
On peace at famine prices.
(For me,* I am no man of wrath,
I own that I should blush
To go in brogues of breezy cloth
Tarred with the Tory brush;
Some want a man of spirit for
Diplomacy—I differ,
I 'd have him made of water or
Skim-milk, but nothing stiffer.)
Each for himself and Heaven for all!
With such a battle-cry,
Though here and there a few may fall.
We cannot wholly die;
But whon, if ever, we agree
And join in tuneful chorus,
Why, then, our unanimity
Will sweep the field before us!
Somewhere, no doubt, exists the man
Peculiarly designed
To lead our lively caravan
Or else to push behind;
He may be turning up to-day.
This week, or next, or never;
But let him come or stay away,
We still roll on for ever!

NINETY-NINE, who in the old year's wake
Follow in a never-broken line,
Come and bring us luck, for pity's sake,
Ninety-nine.
Now with brightest auguries you shine
(Ah 1 the old year had enough of ache)
Peace you offer us, and hope divine.
Yes, but of the promises you make—-
Tell us as we worship at your shrine—
How many per hundred will you break?
Ninety-nine?

A fine Chair, of doubtful design; originally a
Lounge. Has been much altered in Government

where it proved useful.

THE RIOHT HON. SIR WILLIAM VBRNON HARCOUBT, P.C., M.P.
Arms: Quarterly; 1st, On a ship party-coloured, shattered, dismasted and water-logged, a crew
prone to mutiny reguardant in complacence over the side a tried and weather-beaten chief avoirdupois
proper, incontinently jettisoned without scruple or remorse; 2nd, On a ground of grievance two tents of
Achilles, freely canvassed in the press, conjoined morly in tension and possibly somewhat overstrained;
3rd. A masterly heraldic bouget of finance, charged with a fleece of gold lifted proper from sundry
millionaires gorged or, collared in transit on the hop; 4th, On a ground protestant kensittee a veteran
campaigner statant single-handed (on his helmet the motto "Ut veniant omnes!"—"Let 'em all
come! ") bearing a plume mordant guttee de 1'encre transfixing several anglican traitors foxy to the
last but exposed proper in mummery. Crest: Emergent from a crown of the plantagenets, a rogue-
elephant of the forest jumbonee, thwarted circumvented and finally ousted with alacrity. (Motto:
"Contra dexter et audax"—"Skilful and bold in opposition.") Supporters (othervme engaged!
—mainly in accepting resignations by return of post—but in place thereof possibly the following will
answer the purpose): Dexter, an eminent litterateur similarly isolated and unique in courtesy, and
gratitude, charged with a colossal biography proper; sinister, an heraldic sun luluois radiant in geniality,
exemplariljr staunch and filial to the core. Second Motto (Welik translation') : "Lyddthe ryfraf, dyad
yu efl'yr, nod yff y nowydd!"
THE BLUE MEDITERRANEAN.
(Extracts from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.;
Third.)
P. & 0. Mail Steamer "Peninsular."
Gibraltar, Friday.—The Member for Sark,
who once journeyed round the world,
tells me the thing that struck him most
was the way in which pacific England, a
nation of shopkeepers, has grabbed all the
best bits. Sometimes they are big, like
India, Australasia, Canada, and South
Africa. Sometimes they are small, like
Hong Kong, Aden, Malta, and Gibraltar.
But wherever you go, in whichever hemi-
sphere, North of the Line or South, you
find the British flag flying at intervals,
often in quite unexpected places.
"When I was a boy," says SARK, "I used
to read a book called Half Hours with the.
Best Authors. Consider the universe, and
you 'II find that England has possessed her-
self of " Half Hours with the Best Bits."
Something particularly audacious, if you
*" *«"•-'- -* jtj jn our position at
come to think of
Gibraltar. Here's this rock, ultimate acre
of Europe to the South-West, apparently
especially designed for impregnable forti-
fication. Its value is multiplied by the
splendid bay in which men-of-war may
safely ride at anchor within hail of the
shore. For centuries the rock flew the flag
of Imperial Spain. To-day it is ours.
British soldiers garrison it. British guns
perforate its rocky front; in the bay rides
a British fleet—to-day in exceedingly low
spirits at the collapse of the war-cloud.
"In a week," said a gallant Captain,
with a faraway look in his eyes, turned in
the direction of Marseilles, "there wouldn't
have been a French war-ship afloat in the
Mediterranean, and I suppose the Channel
fleet would have looked after them in the
North. At a pinch we could have man-
aged both ends."
And the good man turned away to hide
the unbidden tear.
Saturday.—The "blue" Mediterranean
inky black tinder a leaden sky. The rain-
clouds spouting over Africa. On the other
side the coast of Spain, softly outlined by
ring of fairy hills, on which a sun unknown
to us pours a flood of rosy light.
Sit on deck reading Mr. and Mrs. Neville
Tyson. A clever book rather than a nice
one. Neville Tyson is th« sort of man that
only a woman, armed with blue and red
chalks, vitriolic flame being easy of access,
could draw. Her idea of poor harmle*-s
man is "a brute with the immortal human
soul struggling perpetually to be, the brute
in him supreme and indestructible." Tbat
is the nightmare sort of man MAT SINCLAIR
imagines, and she has forcibly realised her
idea. In artistic contrast with Mr. Nn-Ule
Tyson is Mrs. Neville Tyson, the frivolous,
flirting, outwardly indifferent wife, who for
love of the brute abandons her passionately-
loved child. Incidentally she loses her
peerless beauty in saving her husband from
the fire, which SARK is pleased to reflect,
must be his everlasting portion. When he
deserts her a third time she dies. Aa for
the paragon of husbands, he falls with his
face to the foe in. the Soudan, and even in
Drayton Parya, where all things are re-
membered, his sins are forgotten. "Nay,
more," MAT SINCLAIR writes, with the
gentle sarcasm that occasionally flashes
above the blue light of her story, "they
forbear to speak of his wife's sins out of
respect of the memory of a brave man."
Some more, gentle MAT, please, but
harp on a pleasanter theme.
A TRUE PHILANTHROPIST.
[" Many English Vicars have announced that
cyclists attending their churches will find plates
for storing their machines, but a New York clergy-
man has carried out the brilliant idea of storage for
babies."—Globf.]
TWINS! O ye Gods!—Then groaning, I—
"Ah ! how much longer will they come?
Qvot anni, heu! tot liberi,
And lo! the cry is still they come!
There 's KATE, MARIA, JANE and JACK,
And now another two of them
The thing is past a joke. Alack!
Whatever shall I do with them!"
Wb'le brooding thus, I chanced to learn
About a gentle cleric, a
Good soul of philanthropic turn,
Who hails from North America;
He cares for little infants all,
The dark, the fair, the carroty,
The lean, the fat, the great, the small,
With all-embracing charity.
As up-to-date Divines on stump
Bid cyclists bring their bikes with them,
Providing rooms where each may pump.
Clean, oil—do what he likes with them;
He bids the mothers come to pray,
"And let the infants small come too!
The bottled babe, the toddler gay,
By all means, let 'em all come too!
"Just step in here, and you will see,
Upon a glimpse most cursory,
The vestry makes, you will agree,
A quite ideal nursery.
The little darlings here at large
May gambol, as is right, together—
Of course, a curate's left in charge
To see they do not fight together."
I started up, my beaming face
No longer like a lemon. I
Exclaimed, "Behold! the very place
For my beloved Gemini!
I '11 take them to this good man; he
Will joyfully receive the brats,
And then I'll slip away, d'you see?
And with the curate leave the brats."

his disturbing stomachic'exercises.

well-known fantasia with remarkable precision

tea to my little girl, dear Mr. Muffett, it
would he so Yes, in the white frock.

so easily, doesn't it? . . . Oh! I don't sup-
pose it will show, really, and if it does. . . .
Please, will everybody keep quite quiet for
a minute or two; I haven't said my grace.
. . . Don't you think it's unfair of Nurse?
She's handed me bread and butter twice
running! ... I mustn't eat sponge-cake,
thank you. Bath buns are better for me
than anything. ... I was so ill after
Christina*. They took my temperament
with the barometer, and it was two hun-
dred and six) ... Oh! that's nothing.
When I was ill, the doctor said mine was
perfectly Norman! . . . Well, you might
lower that candleshade a very little, per-
haps, Mr. Muffett. ^ . . Ah! don't blow it
1 out. .. . Throw it into the fire, quick!. . .
It doesn't matter in the least. No; I
wouldn't trouble about the other shades,
thanks. . . . Mother, will you read me the

going to be a soldier, you oughtn't to shut
your eyes when yon pull a cracker. . . .

Shopwalker.
THE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
"ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU, MADAM?"
PaUrfamilias. "THE DOOR!'
MEKBY ENGLAND!—A Jester's Jubilee Sermon.
"SAINT GEORGE and Merrie England I" was the warrior-cry of
old,
Which fired the fair and gentle, and aroused the brave and bold;
And the shout of "Merry England I" should uplift the heart
to-day
Of all true, gallant Britons who in face of fate are gay.
"Merry England 1" In the greenwood, where the jovial archer
drew
A sturdy bow strong-fashioned from the stubborn English yew,
Where the laugh rang out gay chorus to the cheerful hunting
horn,
And men could fight or frolic, was that joyous spirit born.
"Merry England I" When our Shakspeare, in the days of stout
Queen Bess,
When the English lip was mirth-wreathed in the sternest battle
press,
Limned the gay Prince Hal whose laughter at Falstaffian
humours turned
To the set teeth of the hero when the fire of onset burned,
Then, good faith! 'twas Merry England, when intrepid Drake
could play
His merry game of bowls out as fit prelude to the fray;
And Raleigh's bearded lip could curl in laughter at the jest,
Though the Don was on the sea-ways and wild war was in the
West.
And now, although Victoria, the Gentle sways the land,
Instead of Bess the Bellicose, and England, heart and hand,
Sixty years of peace and progress on her Diamond Jubilee
Celebrates in sober gratitude, shall good old English glee,
The glad mirth of Merry England be forgotten? Nay, not so!
Mr. Punch's half a century of laughter answers, No!
Merry England let it be, boys! Must the fortunes of John Bull
Be, as pundits oft describe our British weather, "fine, but dull" T
No; let the British laugh ring forth amidst the British cheers
Which congratulate Victoria on her prosperous Sixty Years I
Old England's wealth's not everything, her heart's not in her
purse;
Coffers chock full with empty soul may well become a .curse;
And power and prosperity may make a galling yoke
To the breast that knows not feeling, and the brain that cannot
joke.
Not the chuckle of the cynic, not the smirk of the sham saint,
Not the grin of him who's victim to our age's huckster taint,
But sound old English merriment, the brave old British mirth,
As refreshing to tired spirits as Spring rains to the parched
earth,
Is what Punch, the Jubilee Jester, would encourage in the
throng.
It is a year for gratitude, pious praise and loyal song;
Let the memory of the Jubilee for ever be kept green,
It still is Merry England that now shouts "Ood save th»
Queen I"

Now, I myself am not of a sporting turn
of mind, and do not profess to know any-
thing about the matter—unless you would
call a little "putting" in the back garden
sport. But as a singularly clear-headed
and astute lawyer—perhaps I ought not to
say this of myself, but I do—Pouncer
knew, of course, to whom he should apply
when in any difficulty or doubt, and just
before Christmas, he wrote, imploring me
to come down to him at Foxbrush Hall, his
Elace in Sportingshire. "Never mind the

me in a serious difficulty." And although,
as I have already said, I am a lawyer of
some considerable repute (Mr. Curtis-

he was going to jump it. But even this
could not check a really keen man, and
Pouncer easily cleared his horse's head

the field beyond. Very few horsemen
would do such a thing as that, I imagine.
The M.F.H. exclaimed that he had never
•fen such a sight in his life. And Pouncer
himself never brags about it, never even
mentions the subject; a mutual friend told
me of the incident. Then Pouncer is a
cricketer and golfer; he races, fishes,
yachts; and as to his shooting, I have
Men told (young Chaffaway was my in-
formant) that Pouncer is the identical
man who made that extraordinary bag of
I'!I9 wild duck in one day; and that, when
Konic ill-natured badinage was flung at him
about the number falling just short of the
thousand, he indignantly repudiated a sug-
tion of my client, that if all criminals were
defended in a similar manner, justice would
oftener be done). I was not at the moment
overwhelmed with work—fact is, the public
don't much care to employ any one who
is rather above the average in point of
ability; no man likes to feel dwarfed in
the presence of his own lawyer—and so I
determined to go to Pouncer's aid. Of
course, I couldn't leave town without a
certain amount of sacrifice of my clients'
interests. For instance, I was obliged to
go down to Toodleton County Court
(13s. -li/.i, and get a postponement of an
action to recover three and sixpence, in
which I had been retained for the plaintiff;
and I also had to depute my clerk to
defend a client of mine who was charged
at the Worship Street Police Court with
pewter pot stealing, and—well, I think
that was about all. These matters satis-
factorily provided for, I wired Pouncer as
follows:
* I never iau> the fee.

POUNCER, Foxbrush Sail, Sportingshire,
"Yes; will come by six-thirty train to-

And with lawyer-like punctuality, I did
arrive by the train mentioned. POUNCER
had come to meet me, and no sooner were
we seated in his high dog-cart, and bowl-
ing along over the three miles of road
which lay between the railway station and
the Hall, than he commenced to un-
burden his mind to me. "Fact is, my
dear Bluffington, I am having a very
anxious time of it. My horse, Golden
Fleece, is favourite for the Grand Christinas
Steeplechase at Mudbury. He is going
on well in his preparation; no horse could
be doing better. But to my horror and
amazement, Police-Sergeant Maresnegt
called on me yesterday and said that"
"From information received," I broke
in, with an astute smile.
"Quite right, my dear fellow; I wonder
how you guessed that?" he resumed, in
admiring tones. "You must be unnatu-
rally sharp."
"Ah! well, never mind." I smiled
again, and it really seemed to inspire poor
Pouncer with confidence in my acute
powers of intuition. "Go on and finish
your story."
"Well, the Sergeant said that, 'from
information received,' he had reason to
believe that—hush 1 sh 11" and Pouncer
looked mysteriously all around in the deep
gloom before uttering another word,
though I am sure no one was within half
a mile of us; "put your ear closer to me
—to believe that an attempt would be
made, this very night, to nobble" the
favourite!—sh!"
"Merciful Powers! you don't say so?"
I exclaimed. I am not sure that I quite
knew what 'nobble' meant, but did not
care to admit this to Pouncer. And I
evidently exercised sound judgment in
using an astonished and slightly horrified
tone of voice in speaking thus.
"Tho point is, how to prevent it, eh P"
he went on.

Driving from the Station.

"Golden Fleece."
"Precisely," I answered. But as I
didn't quite know what "it" was, I was
hardly in a position to advise on the sub-
ject. Another man would have admitted
his igrorance. Not so the cool and prac-
tised lawyer.
Pouncer nodded his head three or four
times in silence. Then he said, "Yes; it's
to be done—this dastard's deed—with a
mallet."
I wondered if they were going to drive
nails into the horse or cut pieces out of
him with a cold chisel. But I still kept
silence, and "sat tight."

say—er—why,
hock, and—er—as you
there you are, you know."
"Yes, there you are," he sighed, whilst
I began to crave for something a little
more tangible than this before being called
on to speak.
"At the dead of night, the villains will
make their attempt," resumed Pouncer,
who is rather theatrical in manner—he was
once a distinguished amateur actor, and
has never quite got over it.
Having stayed at Foxbrush Hall once
before, I knew the situation of the stables,
and remembered that they were directly
overlooked by Pouncer"s study window, a
most cosy little den.
"I have it I " I exclaimed. "Pouncer, we
—just you and I, you know—must watch
the stables all night. We will sit in your
study, make up a cheerful log fire, have the
liqueur-stand out, the Apollinaris and the
Laranagas, my boy, and then, though per-
fectly comfortable, we shall be ON GUARD!
and let the scoundrels beware. What do
you think of that for a scheme?" And
I must confess, although I say it who
shouldn't, that it did strike me as rather
smart.
"I think it's a splendid idea about our
keeping guard ourselves, but unluckily we
can't do it from the study window with the
fire, and the whiskey, and the cigars, as
you suggest; for Golden Fleece is at John
Qrumpy's training stables, five miles
away, and we shall have to stand about in
the cold all night to carry out your idea.
Still, we '11 do it."
I must admit that I did not feel so
eager. I—well, possibly I should not have
suggested this plan had I guessed that the
watching would have to be done outside.
There was a rawness in the air which gave
promise of a fall of snow, too. I tried to
effect a strategic movement en retraite.
"I don't really know why the police
shouldn't do the watching, after all, you
know, Pouncer," I hriran.
"By no means," he interrupted, hastily;
"by no manner of means, my dear fellow,"
and I saw that the stagey aspect of the
scheme had taken hold of his fancy.
'' We '11 dinej and then, cloaked from head
to heel, go silently and on foot" (I rather
winced at this—hate walking) "to the
stables: there, we shall frustrate this vil-
lainous plot. The Sergeant is coming up
to see me at nine o'clock. I '11 get him to
send a constable to meet us at the scene of
action."
I felt a little dull at dinner that night.
Somehow the plan, in its altered form,
e.g., minus the study and its comforts,
seemed to have lost its attractions for me.
Pouncer, however, was brim-full of enthu-
siasm, and when, at nine precisely, the
Sergeant was shown in and asked to take
a seat at the table, cart-ropes and wild
horses wouldn't have kept my host from
going through with the business.
"Help yourself, Sergeant," he said,
passing the port. And the Sergeant
helped himself! He didn't want any
pressing, that man; and when he left to
return to his quarters and despatch a con-
stable to our aid, Pouncer gently mur-
mured, "Pretty swallow, homeward fly."
Snow was lightly falling as, hooded and
cloaked like the villains in a transpontine
melodrama, we started on our long tramp
to the training stables. Pouncer, theatrical
to the last, had insisted on the advisability
of our wearing a disguise, though why we
should do anything of the kind I was
utterly at a loss to think. He had pro-
duced a black wig, a pair of blue goggles,
a beard, and a false nose, and to my great

latter article.
"But my dear fellow," I began, "I

interrupted me with
"Now, Bluffington, every one knows
your great skill in your own line, the law.
Do give me credit for knowing something
about theatrical disguises, and when to
assume them." And, somewhat mollified
by his reference to my well-known legal
acumen, I gave way, and put on the false
nose, whilst he assumed the wig and beard.
Thus disguised, we silently trudged that
awful five miles in the falling snow.
Arriving within fifty yards of the long,
low range of stabling, and hard by
the trainer's cottage, I'oumvr suddenly
gripped my arm and whispered—

"Ha! ha! look at those footprints. You

I saw them; they were big enough, cer-
tainly, and evidently made by a very
"useful" foot.
"He has gone right up to the stable
door," continued Pouncer. "Depend upon
it, it is this man's hand which will be
apparent in to-night's work 1"
"His foot is, anyhow," I replied.
"We will track him down. But softly

But even as we spoke, a fleeting moon-

from fri—astonishment. Then the lurking
form advanced rapidly on us, and we
simultaneously turned to—I mean, we both
conceived the idea, curiously enough, at
the same moment of time, that we really
ought to go to the cottage and apprise the

man was upon me. Why he should have

don't know. I could have wished it other-
wise, as he caught me by the collar and
administered such a severe shaking that
all the teeth in my head seemed to rattle
again.
"So I've got yer, 'ave I? You're the
party as has come to nobble the Golden
Fleas, 'ave yer?" (Another shake.) "Got
a faNe conk on, too!" (Shake number
three.) "Well, you're buckled to rights
this journey, and no error."
But just at this moment another fitful
gleam of moonlight revealed the mystery.
My assailant wore a hebnet and shining
black leather pelisse. It was the con-
stable !" Pelisse constable," grinned
Pouncer, laughing at his own feeble joke.
I did not appear to hear him. It was easy
enough for mm to cut his jokes, I dare
say. He hadn't had half of his teeth
loosened by this truculent brute. I had.
I accepted the constable's apologies with
the best grace I could assume. Then he
greatly annoyed me again by bursting out
into boorish laughter at my false nose.
How I cursed Pouncer for making me
wear the ridiculous thing. He himself was
rather improved in appearance by the wig
and beard he had assumed. Any disguise
would be sure to improve a man with a
face like Pouncer's.
We took up our position round the
corner of the stables to commence our
weary vigil, and I will not deny that the
presence of the constable's stalwart form
had its comforting influence on me. One
could not feel quite so lonely when stand-
ing next to a man like the Eiffel Tower.
We got colder and colder. The snow fell
in intermittent showers, and before long,
my feet felt completely frozen; and,
speaking for myself, I should have been
willing to abandon the enterprise alto-
gether. Pouncer, however, was inexor-
able, and until I was afflicted with a terrific
fit of sneezing, even refused to allow me to
remove my false nose.
The hours wore slowly on. It must have
been about four in the morning when the
constable, in hoarse tones (we were all
quite certain of violent colds by that time)
remarked that he " could do with a drink.
We passed by the observation in silence ; it
was vulgar and in bad taste. But I took
a surreptitious sip now and then at a small
pocket-flask I had with me—really too small
to offer to the others. My teeth were
chattering, and I sneezed at distressingly
frequent intervals. No sign of any mid-
night marauders coming. Oh! why had 1
ever left the Temple, I asked myself,
! despairingly, to be frozen to death watch-

inc for villains who never come? Why
did I ever suggest this vigil to Pouncer P
Why did I Oh 1 d—n Pounper!
And I tried again to stamp the blood into
»y frozen feet, and actually rubbed the
tip of my false nose feelingly, my own
being so numbed by this time that I
couldn't tell the real from the sham.
The clock over the stables had just struck
the hour of five, when Pouncer convul-
sively clutched my cloak. "See, they
come," he exclaimed, in deep, tragic tones,
and sure enough, our patience was to be
rewarded at last, for approaching us through
the now thawing snow (it had been a
beast of a night!) we could just discern
the forms of two men and a boy. They
tension—as I saw the big constable draw
his truncheon, and lead the way to the
stables.
We were upon them before they had
time for any effective resistance—that is,
the constable was. Pouncer and I held
ourselves in readiness, as a sort of reserve,
in the background. The policeman's
attack was splendid. With his staff he
knocked down the first man on the spot,
then he half throttled the second; whilst
we, Pouncer and I — as reserves, you
understand—advanced upon the boy. Al-
though small, he proved a desperate cus-
tomer, and it was only after the constable
had secured and handcuffed his second
man, and come to our assistance, that we
that insufferable idiot, Pouncer, actually
< turned round in a furious passion, and
laid the blame upon me!
The following week, the much-talked-of
Golden Fleece finished an inglorious last in
the Mudbury Grand Christmas Steeple-
chase. Pouncer has retired from the turf
in disgust. John Grumpy and his head
lad have brought actions against him to
recover heavy damages for assault and
battery; whilst the miserable ingrate him-
self, meeting me in the hall of the Junior
International, called me a blithering idiot,
before witnesses, and said he had half &
mind to kick me down the stairs. Verily,
gratitude is an extinct emotion in this
world. What I feel to be harder than

spoke no word, and came steadily along to
the stables.
"I see it all!" murmured Pouncer.
"The boy is to be put through the key-
hole—the window I mean. He will then
admit the men by the door. Once aboard
the lug Once inside, the deed will be
done quickly. But we will friutrate them.
Hist! Down with youl Down, man, for
your life!"
And he shoved me violently into a
squatting posture in the wet snow—most
unpleasant position, and wholly unneces-
sary, as we were round the corner, and
quite out of sight—but Pouncer always
was so fond of stage effect.
We gave them about two minutes in
which to effect an entrance. I turned my
head and took just one last sip of the flask,
and then—well, I am free to confess that
I gave a great gulp, not exactly from ner-
vousness, you know, but a great swallow,
indicating tension—yes, that's the word,
"Golilen Fleece finished an inglorious last."
succeeded in making the capture. Unfor-
tunately, the little ruffian had inflicted
considerable injury upon us before accept-
ing defeat, and Pouncer had received a
severe blow in the region of the lower
chest, whilst I was suffering from the
effects of a kick somewhere at the back of
me. A light was quickly struck, and the
whole scene revealed to us.
I am bound to say that anything more
painful and humiliating I have never wit-
nessed before or since.
We had knocked down, captured, hand-
cuffed, or otherwise maltreated, not the
nefarious-minded "nobblers " for whom we
had been watching, but Pouncer's emi-
nently respectable trainer, Mr. John
Grumpy, his head lad. and the boy in
attendance on Golden Fleece., all of whom
had just entered the stable in pursuance of
their ordinary early morning avocations.
As the lately-contending parties gazed
blankly and breathlessly at each other,
anything—except perhaps that horrid little
stable-boy's boot—is that Pouncer, with
these two actions on hand; has gone to
another lawyer, and left me in the lurch.
ST\R-CtIM-MoON8HTNB FOR DECEMBER.—
At the time of the New Moon, Jupiter will
be triumphant, in spite of the efforts of
Scorpio to cause trouble. Good fortune
to the Sultan of Turkey and the Junior
Common Law Judge, both of whom will
receive congratulations of a pleasing cha-
racter. The 25th will be a great day for
holly and mistletoe. Boxing Day, 26th,
generally lucky to tradesmen, officials, ser-
vants, and others. The weather will not
disappoint expectations. Astrological (and
universal) motto for the month, A Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of
us."
