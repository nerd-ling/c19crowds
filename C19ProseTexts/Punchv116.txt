&&. ORNING,” said the British Red Deer, nodding across the palings to the Spring-bok. “Town pretty full, what?”
“Yes,” said his neighbour. “It’s this polyglot show round there in the Bosch that brings the foreigners in.
Never heard such a varied lot of language in my life, and I’ve spent half of it in Zoos. And such respectable-
looking gentlemen, too. Seen them strolling through here of an afternoon on their way from the Huis to take the
Stoom-tramway to Scheveningen.”
“What are they doing here?” asked the Red Deer. “Is it a Church Congress?”
“Not exactly that,” said the Spring-bok. “I rather think it's a meeting of people interested in Life-saving
Apparatus. Two of them—Russians, I fancy—passed my cage the other day talking French. Picked up a smattering
of the tongue myself at the Marseilles Zoo, where they landed me to get acclimatised to Europe. Well, one of them
said something that gave me quite a shock. “Damnable things these dum-dums l’ That's what he said.”
“What's a dum-dum ?” asked the Red Deer.
“Sort of pellet you get shot with,” said the Spring-bok, who was very well-informed.
“Anything like the explosive pattern they use up our way?” asked the Red Deer. “Wery insidious, my friends
tell me.”
“Not so noisy as that ; but it's got a flattened head, and won't come out the other side.”
“And what did the other gentleman say?”
“He said the dum-dum was an outrage on civilisation, and he was glad to see the brutal English were going to
have a lesson in humanity. Daresay you’ve had your prejudices against English sportsmen during the stalking-
season; but I don't really think they can be so very unkind. One of them, such a nice-mannered old gentleman, came
by the other day, with a hump on his back and a small dog. He addressed the latter with a very perfect Dutch accent.
“Silence, Toby,’ he said, ‘and remember the notice, No dogs of war admitted 1’ And he came up and patted me on the
head and gave me a mixed biscuit and asked me how my poor old Oom was.”
“What's an Oom 7” asked the Red Deer.
“Kind of paternal Uncle,” said the Spring-bok.
“Well, how was he?” asked the Red Deer.
“That's just it. Nobody here seems to know exactly how he is. You see, our people haven't sent over any
missionaries to this Bosch Congress, not being a sovereign nation, like—well, for instance, like the hilly little place our
young friend, the chamois, comes from. So I asked him if he knew. And he said my Oom was suffering just now from

a sluggish liver; but warm external applications were being used.

“Then he asked me what I thought of the Boers as marksmen. And I told him they were pretty accurate—or
had been, before I left the country. Only they overdid it, and nearly exterminated us; result being that they were
getting out of practice for want of moving targets. Doubtful whether they could hit a sitting Englishman now at more
than fifteen hundred yards. Ah! here he comes again l’”
“Who? a sitting Englishman?” asked the Red Deer.
“No, stupid,” said the Spring-bok, “Can't you see the nice old thing with the hump behind * Wonder if he's
got any more mixed biscuits about him?” -
“He looks very good and kind,” said the Red Deer. “Why, of course, I know him quite well. He used to draw
pictures of us and the sportsmen at home 1”
With elastic step and a jaunty air of general philanthropy, the Sage of Fleet Street (for it was he) passed by,
scattering wide largesse of buns and biscuits as he went, and saying, “Par vobiscum !” at intervals to the various animals.
“And to think,” he was murmuring to himself, in between, “that all these barriers between beast and beast will
shortly be removed ; and we shall have the lion walking out with the bear and the rooster sitting down beside the
crocodile. Man, returning to Paradise (of which the word Bosch is so infelicitous an equivalent), is bound to bring in his
train the brute creation, which will follow his good, as they once followed his bad, example. For"—and here he broke
out into melody—
“There's never a note “The sword has a crook
In the Gatling's throat, Like a pruning-hook,
The sight of the rifle's blurred ; There's a hole in the big, big drum;
The clarion's blast They've shovelled the shot
Is a thing of the past, In the melting-pot,
The same as the Dodo-bird. And the ping of the dum-dum 's dumb 1
All which,” he added, “is largely due to my happy thought ; one of those spontaneous touches which make the whole
world kin " And for the twentieth time he drew from his breast and read aloud an official document in orange-tinted
vellum. It was headed “AN UNsolicited TESTIMONIAL,” and at the foot ran the words, “Make what use of this you
like.” The rest of it was as follows:—
“The Delegates of the Peace Conference assembled at the Huis ten Bosch, severally and in combination beg to
thank Mr. PUNCH for the handsome gift which he has conferred upon each of them without invidious distinction; and to
assure him that their heavy labours in the cause of Universal Amiability have been conspicuously lightened by the ,

is so much nicer not to have the bore of
dancing.

AFTER-DINNER THOUGHTS.
I.—PRELIMINARY PRECAUTION.
THERE are few ºff. more charming thirty shillings for a moderate-sized bundle,
than a well-planned dinner-party, none
more dolorous than a bad one. As a great
philosopher has remarked, the success of a
good dinner depends quite as much upon
what is on the chairs as it is concerned
with what is on the tables. The assertion
might be put more strongly. Better is a
dinner of herbs, where bright people are,
than a dainty banquet with insufferable
bores. If the wine is bad you need not
drink it; if the meats are poor and ill-
cooked, you can eat bread. ut you can't
get away from your right and left neigh-
bour, bore they never so drearily. Like
Sterne's Starling. you “can't get out.”
Doctors enjoy in this respect an advan-
tage over their patients. If you are a doc-
tor, and in doubt about your company or
your dinner, play a messenger. Suppose
the dinner is fixed for 8 o'clock. By half-
past you will pretty well know what's on
the table and what’s on the chairs. Have
your messenger arrive sharp on the stroke
of the half-hour, bringing a note. If all is
well, you nod your head sagaciously,
murmur, “I thought so,” and tell the
servant there is no answer. If you are in
for a mauraise hour and a half, plead
urgency; make your apologies; go off to
your club ; have a pint of decent claret,
a cut off the joint, and a restful evening.
This arrangement serves a double debt
to pay. It spreads wholesome idea of the
extent and urgency of your business, and
at the same time delivers you from the
burden of what promised to be a fearsome
night.
A modification of this simple device is
possible to the wary diner-out who does
not belong to the medical profession. Be-
fore starting for an unfamiliar or doubtful
dinner-table, address to yourself a tele-
gram (it may purport to come from “P.
Toots”) timed to arrive at 8.30. If it finds
you dying to get off, here is your oppor-
tunity.
d'hôte. For the pleasure or misery of the
sitting you are entirely dependent upon
your neighbour on the right or left.
It is here where the telegram or mes-
senger from the surgery comes as a boon
and a blessing to man.
Once seated at the dinner-table and no
hope of deliverance, try and make the best
Of course you will not eat peas:
with your knife. That is an elementary
rule of good manners. There are other
of it.
tendencies to be guarded against. When
asparagus is just coming in, and costs
don't ºp. you are served early in
the roun
fer to your plate a full half of its contents.
If the dinner begins with turtle soup,
and your neighbour on the right, not
caring for green fat, leaves a succulent
piece on his plate, whatever you do, don't
stick your fork into the morsel and convey
it to your mouth. If you feel temptation
overcoming you, look the other way.
Don't drink your soup out of the plate as
if it were a saucer. %. ask how much
anything on the table cost. Don't stuff
a corner of your serviette between your
neck and shirt-collar as if you were going
to be shaved. Don't emphasize argument
by brandishing a knife. Don't leave the
room before the ladies; and when the
spirit-lamp is handed round, don't blow it
out when you have lit your own cigar.
III.-A RARE FEAST.
SoME dinner-givers affect eccentricity in
their menu. Here’s a copy of an invita-
tion received last Lent: “Dear Duke,
Come and dine with me on Thursday.
You shall have bread made of wheat that
browned under the sun before Moses
crossed the Red Sea; Butter churned in
the spacious days of Queen Elizabeth ;
Wine that was getting up in years at the
time of the Armada. For dessert there be
apples that grew on trees in the first
century.”
Interesting this rather than attractive.
Bread likely to be a bit stale, and as for the

IV.-A NEw Soup (“Soupçon de
l'Earwig’”).
DINING the other night with an old
friend at home in one of the Channel
| Islands, we had a sublime soup. Simply
compounded, as all good soup should
be ; with a flavour of vegetable and
a faint faraway reminiscence of a game
leg—whether of partridge or grouse I’m
not sure. But beyond the ordinary flavour
of successful soup, not unfamiliar to the
palate, there was a distinct SOMETHING
in this dish that I do not remember to have
met with before. Tried to pump the
Member for Sark, but he's very close in
these matters.
“I’ll give you a dinner,” he said, “with
pleasure. Always like to have at my table
a man who knows what he's eating and
drinking. But when it comes to letting
you into all the kitchen secrets, that 's
another pair of sleeves. The soup is good,
I know, and I’m glad you recognise that
peculiar touch of flavouring which might
have escaped the notice of a less acute and
well-trained palate. But don't ask me how
it is achieved. Have another spoonful ?”
Don't usually take two helpings of soup,
but the temptation irresistible. Looking
down on plate, thought I saw something
unusual. Here, peradventure, was the
secret. Perhaps it was ; at any rate it was
an earwig. Sark was, for him, a little
taken aback when he saw me fish the crea-
ture out and lay it on the rim of the plate.
“I suppose it got in by accident,” I said.
“You are not going to draw me,” he
replied, somewhat blusteringly.

his plate. All the same, it was the best
I have tasted for a long time. Try it.
Strictly an Autumn dish. In September
earwigs are cheap, especially in the Island
of Sark. Only, in order to avoid narrow
prejudice, the soup, before serving, should
be carefully strained.

AFTER-DINNER THOUGHTS.
I.—PRELIMINARY PRECAUTION.
THERE are few º more charming
than a well-planned dinner-party, none
more dolorous than a bad one. As a great
philosopher has remarked, the success of a
good dinner depends quite as much upon
what is on the chairs as it is concerned
with what is on the tables. The assertion
might be put more strongly. Better is a
dinner of herbs where bright people are,
than a dainty banquet with insufferable
bores. If the wine is bad you need, not
drink it; if the meats are poor and ill-
cooked, you can eat bread. ut you can't
get away from your right and left neigh-
bour, bore they never, so drearily. Like
Sterne's Starling. you “can't get out.”
Doctors enjoy in this respect an advan-
tage over their patients. If you are a doc-
tor, and in doubt about your company or
your dinner, play a messenger. Suppose
the dinner is fixed for 8 o'clock. By half-
past you will pretty well know what's on
the table and what’s on the chairs. Haye
your messenger arrive sharp on the stroke
of the half-hour, bringing a note. If all is
well, you nod your fi. sagaciously,
murmur, “I thought so,” and tell the
servant there is no answer. If you are in
for a mauraise hour and a half, plead
urgency; make your apologies; go off to
your club ; have a pint of decent claret,
a cut off the joint, and a restful evening.
This arrangement serves a double debt
to pay. It spreads wholesome idea of the
extent and urgency of your business, and
at the same time delivers you from the
burden of what promised to be a fearsome
night.
A modification of this simple device is
possible to the wary diner-out who does
not belong to the medical profession. , Be;

dinner-table, address to yourself a tele-

tunity.

If the dinner begins with turtle soup,
and your neighbour on the right, not
caring for green fat, leaves a succulent
piece on his plate, whatever you do, don't
stick your fork into the morsel and convey
it to your mouth. If you feel temptation
overcoming you, look the other way.
Don't drink your soup out of the plate as
if it were a saucer. %. ask how much
anything on the table cost. Don't stuff
a corner of your serviette between your
neck and shirt-collar as if you were going
to be shaved. Don't emphasize argument
by brandishing a knife. Don't leave the
room before the ladies; and when the
spirit-lamp is handed round, don't blow it
out when you have lit your own cigar.

Old Tempus on the wing;

By night we did The Ring.

And pºssed amazing strictures
On Art and other things.

Together danced till dawn.

To heal us when we crack,
I say I sigh for Summer,

THE UNIKNOWN FRIEND.
(An Incident of the Holidays.)
It’s very odd' I know the face,
Ome couldn't easily forget him.
But yet I can’t exactly place
The last occasion when I met him;
In London, doubtless, I had passed
With just a nod, polite and frigid,
But, while these weeks at Slocombe last,
My etiquette is not so rigid:
Thus, seeing one whose face I know,
I felt that “Here's a fellow-sinner
Enduring the same penance,” so
I promptly bade him come to dinner.
I wonder why he showed surprise?
My friendliness was unexpected,
Yet that but partly justifies
Such diffidence ere he accepted.
He seemed well-dressed (although I think
Those large-sized checks should be abo-
lished);
His black straw hat quite made me blink,
It was so beautifully polished.—
His hat! Good gracious! Fatal day !
His hat ' Why, that explains the matter.
I wonder what my wife will say?
That fellow is-my London hatter!
THE AUGUSTAN AGE.
Now is the time when we pack our
portmanteaus, study our Bradshaws, and
drive to the station. Yet it must be con-
fessed that a train-journey is wearisome,
and most of all if one travels in solitude.
But why should any one be compelled to
do this? Why should not the railway
companies provide agreeable travelling
companions, to be hired, at a moderate
fee, for the journey P. The advantages of
such a system are so obvious, that the only
wonder is that it has not been adopted
long ago.
You have, let us suppose, to travel from
sight. To write is even worse, not to
speak of the fact that your friends won't
be able to read your letters, and even may
be led to infer from your handwriting that
you have taken to drink. No ; what you
really need is an agreeable companion to
enliven you. . Accordingly, you will con-
|sult the superintendent, and will ascertain
from him what members of the travelling-
companion staff are disengaged. He will
hand you some such list as the following:—
in the train is notoriously bad for the eye-
“Lord D.—Very aristocratic; gives a
high-class flavour to any journey; new
and exclusive anecdotes about the Upper
Ten ; can only be hired by first-class pas-
sengers.
“Miss E.-Charming lady companion ;
describes each place of interest passed on
the journey; also an authority on mil-
linery.
“Mr. F.—A favourite with artists and
literary men. If desired, will discuss ex-
clusively his fellow-traveller's works.”

From this list you will select the tra-

will be that it will create a new profession

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1899.
KEEPER. A martyr to foxes, who de-
votes his emergies to keeping feathered
bipeds alive in order that the unfeathered
variety may slay them. He absorbs in tips
the balance of a sportsman's ready money,
frequently beats a covert only to be beaten
observance of a fox. If he does not say
“yoicks” and “tally ho” as often as the
song-writers suppose, the fault may be
imputed to a nature which cares little for
any music except that of the hounds whom
he often rates—not perhaps as highly as
they deserve. Though he is not given to
trundling things, he has a whoo-hoop of
his own, which he sometimes rolls out with
great effect. Usually a perfectly honest
and straightforward man, he yet enjoys
carrying a mask—but only after he has
outmanoeuvred the wiliest animal in exist-
ence by going very straight. He has
firmly-rooted opinions in regard to scent,
but though he knows nothing about it, he
knows quite as much as anybody else.
FIELD. No false inferences as to its
nature and appearance should be drawn
THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER.
DEAD Fort
A DUCAT.
by the back-flight of cocks and hens, and,
though he is not a cricketer, often in-
dulges in a good long drive, shouts “over”
.# much persistency, and is sometimes,
but not always, missed.
GUN. Is sometimes masculine and some-
times neuter. The feminine variety,
though not entirely obsolete, is unfavour-
ably regarded by the best authorities. A
dangerous gun may be inoffensive to fur
and feather, but is a source of constant
apprehension to his neighbours, who can
be heard remarking after such a gun has
shot, that he ought himself to be shot.
When this gun's goes off, the rest of
the party would #. imitative is human
nature, to do the same. You can choke
a gun to make it kill, and cast it off in
order to use it better, but if it jams con-
stantly, you never preserve it.
HUNTSMAN. being who is honoured
from the common phrase “the Field a
Monkey.” The Field never contains a
favourite; hence the expression, “a fair
field and no favour.” A good fellow may
be a shocking field, and, therefore, a poor
all-round cricketer. On the other hand,
a good field will stop cuts, and at the same
time, paradoxically enough, may reap eter-
nal fame.
BAG. A metaphorical expression to
which birds are brought by keepers, beaters
and guns. It is a curious fact, hitherto
insufficiently noticed by mathematicians,
that if you add together the individu
exploits of a party of guns, they invariably
exceed the actual total of the . Bags,
like drinks, may be mixed, but the result
in the case of bags is generally agreeable,
robably owing to its association with cold
ead and not with hot coppers. The verb
active, “to bag,” is sº ed irregularly
eager desire for .. and “he
bagged my wind,” implying a no less eager
desire for revenge. is latter sort of bag-
ging is often due to boxing.
Rod. A simple object, productive some-
times of fish, more frequently of menda-
city. It is not generally known that if
all the tall stories told by the users of rods
were placed one on the top of the other
they would reach from the earth to the
moon. Hence the word “lunatic” is often
applied to those who fish from punts, and
drink cold whiskey and water. Some rods
are spared, others are split, but the former
variety only spoils a child, whereas the
latter often kills a fish. Rods, like good
jokes, have a point, and, like practical
jokers, have a butt; but # you give your
butt to trout or salmon, the , a morose,
cold-blooded creature, is rarely pleased.
WHEEL. A dual noun, since a man who
speaks of his wheel Always means his bi-
cycle. Was once called “safety,” on the
lucus a non lucendo principle, but has now
given rise to a new heading, “Bicycle
Fatalities,” in the newspapers. Generally
fed on oil, punctures and spanners, always
breaks down ten miles }. anywhere
causes more hard language than golf, and
breaks more bones than football. After
and before certain hours, wheels become
like acrostics and have lights. Yet the
absence of a light causes a wheel to be
immediately seen by a policeman, where-
upon a magistrate generally says, “ten
shillings and costs.” º: man's wheel is
better and cheaper than every other man’s.

Are you a member? No, I use my sister-

that, so long as you pay for everything as
you get it, they never bother you about
numbers and things. . . . . . oš they’re

I get him a pen-wiper, and if it's a
woman, a pin-cushion. They’re always
welcome, my dear, and they’re things one
can’t have too many of. . . . No,

A. Pardon me—I think, madam, you are
misled by the associations of the title,
which may, perhaps—ah—verge on vul-

from objection, and popular with the most
select and refined circles.
P. L. (firmly). The name is quite suffi-

Mrs. H. Oh! I don't know. When Mrs.
Perkins was at Scarborough this Summer,
she bought a byutiful figger—lo-ovely it was
—nearly three-quarters of a yard high, and
a little damaged, such a job as she had to
get a box to fit it, too. That was at an
auction in the Arcade.

THE NEW “PROVINCIAL TOUR.”
[“A new revival of the Thespian cart is said to be in contemplation, in the
form of a travelling “theatre-car,’ to be attached to trains making long
journeys, to the end that passengers may beguile their time by witnessing
dramatic performances.”—World.]
ExcelleNT idea, this. Have to travel west to-day; shall cer-
tainly patronise the “theatre-car"; much more amusing than
reading magazines. Have secured seat well in the front; curtain
not yet risen. Band behind the scenes is playing an overture,
selections, I think, from The Bohemian Girl or Lo in. Can't
be quite sure which, as our wretched engine is emitting a series of
prolonged screeches. Glance at programme. Foiled Tor, Beauty
and the Bacillus. Evidently a melodrama. Ah! the curtain is
going up. Settle myself comfortably in my seat by the window,
and prepare to be thrilled.
Act I.-Getting on swimmingly. Young lady, evidently the
heroine, in drawing-room scene, arranging flowers. Enter a maid
with a letter, which the heroine reads aloud. Rather annoying,
a luggage-train passed us just then, and I couldn't catch the
most important sentence. However, dare say it won't matter.
Enter a #. man, apparently a doctor, who is attending her
father. egins to make love to the heroine, and means business,
too. In about three minutes comes to a prºposal. Will she accept
him? Evidently uncertain. “REGINALD,” she says, in a voice
trembling with emotion, “I have listened to you patiently. And,
as you wish, you shall have your answer, here and now. That
answer, REGINALD, is—” Crash / Really most vexatious! Just
at this exciting moment we plunge into a tunnel. , Can neither see
the stage nor hear a word of the dialogue. Ah! that was a pistol,
surely ſ. Is she shooting him, or is he—? ... But perhaps it was
only a fog-signal, after i. Emerge into daylight at last. To m
astonishment, two elderly ladies now occupy the stage. “An
so,” says one of them, evidently finishing a story, “I have con-
fided the secret to you, knowing that you will never reveal it.”
“Wretched woman ſ” cries the other, violently, “Do you not know
that I am—” ...“Change here for Slumpington,” shout the
porters as we pull up with a jerk, and the curtain comes down

The news adds a fresh interest to life on the Riviera. Though Mr.
Robinson has “descendu" at the hotel he is not likely to remain
immured within its walls. He will drive about the town, probably
walk through its streets. At any turn one may meet him, though,
unhappily, without certainty of recognition. Still, it is something
to have the prospect of entertaining Robinson unawares. Mean-
while we are comforted with knowledge of his descent, leaving for
awhile the companionship of his co-archangels Brown and Jones,

It is announced that after more than forty years' occupancy of

a paper that is an honour to British journalism. . He and it
have ever been the resolute impeccable advocates of what they
regarded as first causes. They are of the sort that bring provincial
journalism to the level of the surprised metropolis. After forty
years of life's fitful fever as it beats about the chair of the Editor
of a great daily newspaper, Mr. BUNCE has earned the right to rest
well. May he long enjoy the opportunity.

Max. “And don’t you have any either,

“A feller can't last through a Christmas

There's the turkey, and beef, and pudding,

*::: to call attention to the bad way

General frowns at Max, who kicks ToMMY
under table. Unpleasant pause. Say has-

ToMMY. “Why, I’ve counted—” But
at this moment, Max, with the aplomb
which always distinguishes him, exclaims,
“Shut up, STINKER,” and ToMMY subsides,
with severe smile, to take any more cham-
pagne. The two boys drink theirs with
water! Ye gods! My Irroy slashed out
into tumblers and drowned with water!
This gives PILLINGToN his chance
scoring off General. “Should think cham-
pagne, even when diluted freely, hardly the
thing for the young folk,” he says, in his
best “bed-side” manner, looking at me.
Why me? So unpleasant. Evidently a
challenge to General, who retorts, “I don't
think the quantity my boys take is likely to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
To the Earl of Rosebery.
My Lord, Among the various sorts of speculation, whether
upon the Stock Exchange or in the world of thought, none is more
fascinating than that which deals with the careers and the possibili-
ties of public men. It will probably not surprise you to learn that
there are in this country innumerable men engaged at present in
casting your horoscope. They are from the ranks of both political
arties: some of them devote blameless abilities to the service of
. or weekl jº, some are well-known to the general
public, others hide such ight as they possess under the bushel of
some remote association of provincial politicians; but whatever
their pursuits may be, they are united by one common tie of wonder
as to what will become of yourself when destiny next shuffles the
cards in the game of Liberal Leadership.
You º ask me why I should intrude my pen into this over-
penned subject. Is it fair, you will say, to add another to the
small worries—the pen-pricks, as I may term them, of §.
that beset a retired statesman whose one desire it is to shrink from
public life and all its turbulence in order that, calmly reposing
either at Dalmeny or at the Durdans, he may devote his ease to
the ºp. of graceful essays on literary men 2 You ma
object, of course, that this, which I have put into your mouth, is
not a fair statement of your position or your desires, but in my
case I may appeal for my justification to JUVENAL, who, as you
know, Hºff. with an unflattering word the intention
Cum tot ubique
Watibus occurras, periturae parcere chartae.
With him I may say,
Semper ego auditor tantum, nunquamne reponam?
though I make no indiscreet attempt to find a modern parallel for
the hoarse CoDRUs who drove the Roman poet to the composition
of his satires.
What then is to be your fortune? The question, difficult
enough in itself, is rendered more than ordinarily difficult by the
fact that little or no guidance is to be gained from a study of your
own words and acts. You seem content, if I may adapt the lines,
To leave the brutal world to take its way,
And, “Patience! in another life,” you say,
“The world shall be thrust down, and I up-borne.”
That is, of course, so far as the world of political strife is concerned.
The position for a man of a sensitive temperament—and, to be
sure, you do not possess the thick skin or the brazen, front that
Birmingham begets in some of its celebrated citizens—the position,
I say, is an intelligible one. The meanness, the jealousy, the spite,
the spirit of petty intrigue, the underhand strivings, the crosses,
the disappointments—these which make up a part, small or great
according to circumstances, of the atmosphere in which every
public man must move, foil you and depress you and wear you
out. But these, too, to a strong man conscious of his vigour, are
incentives that spur him to renewed effort, and you too, if indeed
ou are what your friends in private or in the Press declare you to
, will battle down obstacles so petty and will assert your
manhood over their ruins. , Agreeable, no doubt, is life at
. pleasant it must be to play the º of the hap
man delighting in his children, his books, and his swift and well-
trained horses, and to issue forth only upon the most judiciously
selected public or semi-public occasions to praise some successful
soldier or to endear lº to Scottish hearts by skilful eulogy of
the much eulogised BURNs. Such a life is .# and delightful in its
way, but can it suffice to one who has drunk delight of battle with
the House of Peers, and has swayed the destinies, for however
short a time, of a great people 2. I think not. You are still, as our
statesmen go, young, and soon or late, whether you be chosen to
form a Government or to lead a Party, the inexorable pressure of
circumstances will force you from your retirement.
Well, my Lord, you have many advantages: you have wealth
and high position, a gift of oratory which, though perhaps some-
times too carefully elaborated and too little spontaneous, is gene-
rall º in its effect both on those who hear and those who
read. and a neat trick ofº: a dart between the joints of Lord
SALISBURY's harness. Even the Duke of ARGYLL, that rough-
tongued Caledonian boar, has felt the arrow of your wit and has
retired defeated from a contest too rashly undertaken. Moreover,
yº have many friends, whose devotion you have secured as much
y the charm of your sympathetic manner as by your public
services to the State. But on the other hand there are drawbacks.
I do not speak now of the melancholy fact that you are an Earl,
for I do not think, whatever, Mr. LABouchERE may say to the
SOLILOOUY.
“If I hold on, I'LL Lose MY TRAIN ; IF I LET Go, I'LL FA' |
DIW on YBoDY HEAR TELI, o' sic A PREDICAMENT #"
rieve
not
creed. But there are others. Men who mistrust you—I
that they should exist—have been heard to say that you lac
merely political insight but nerve. It was you, they say, as much
as the two young Emperors, who brought to nought the efforts of
Christendom on behalf of the Armenians, for in that terrible crisis
your courage gave way and you shrank back before the perils that
your timorous imagination evoked. And in truth, without some such
crisis, we have no opportunity for estimating the true quality of
our public men: , Many a man has for the greater part of his life
fancied himself to be brave, who, when actual danger came and
blows were impending, felt his heart contract and his courage
ooze away. Strength after all lies in action, and not in valorous
words or in the rhetorical putting down of a foot intended for the
intimidation of foreign nations.
Others there are, strong and consistent Liberals, who regard with
an uneasy suspicion what they term your curious, devotion to the
things military, º: propensity to a somewhat sentimental
Jingoism. These men—they are not so few as is often ..".
hold by the ancient faith. They are not Little Englanders, for
most of them would spend the i. drop of their blood in defence
of the Empire; but they doubt if the Empire is well served by
those who *ś r and bluster and shape their policy to earn the
approval of Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN or of the music halls. They
believe that the acquisition of an African swamp is more than
counterbalanced by heavy taxation and the increase of militarism;
and they desire that their leaders should apply themselves with
greater earnestness to the Condition of England question.
Here, my Lord, I must end. I cannot flatter myself that I have
done much to make your future clear. Perhaps it were best to
leave it to #. for itself. In the meantime, I remain,
our Lordship's faithful servant, THE WAGRANT.
“ALL For ‘E.R.R.'”—If Sir Edward RUssell, in the Liverpool
Post, does occasionally tell an amusing tale which has to be contra-
dicted by somebody or other, recently by Lord RoseBERY, then
under the signature “E.R.R.” he has only to print the quotation,
Re-- “To ERR is human: to forgive won't Lord—er—er—RoseBERY be 
contrary, that the .#. Liberal entertains anything but a
cordial admiration for an Earl as a chief exponent of his political

that they should exist—have been heard to say that you lac
merely political insight but nerve. It was you, they say, as much
as the two young Emperors, who brought to nought the efforts of
Christendom on behalf of the Armenians, for in that terrible crisis
your courage gave way and you shrank back before the perils that
your timorous imagination evoked. And in truth, without some such
crisis, we have no opportunity for estimating the true quality of
our public men: , Many a man has for the greater part of his life
fancied himself to be brave, who, when actual danger came and
blows were impending, felt his heart contract and his courage
ooze away. Strength after all lies in action, and not in valorous
words or in the rhetorical putting down of a foot intended for the
intimidation of foreign nations.
Others there are, strong and consistent Liberals, who regard with
an uneasy suspicion what they term your curious, devotion to the
things itary, and your propensity to a somewhat sentimental
Jingoism. These men—they are not so few as is often supposed—
hold by the ancient faith. They are not Little Englanders, for
most of them would spend the last drop of their blood in defence
of the Empire; but they doubt if the Empire is well served by
those who º and bluster and shape their policy to earn the
approval of Mr. ALFRED AustiN or of the music halls. They
believe that the acquisition of an African swamp is more than
counterbalanced by heavy taxation and the increase of militarism;
and they desire that their leaders should apply themselves with
greater earnestness to the Condition of England question.
Here, my Lord, I must end. I cannot flatter myself that I have
done much to make your future clear. Perhaps it were best to
leave it to speak for itself. In the meantime, I remain,
our Lordship's faithful servant, THE WAGRANT.

A VANISHED ISLAND.
(Ectracts from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.;
Fourth.)
Gulf of Lyons, Saturday afternoon.-
Before we left London, the Member for
Sark, who is a special authority on Channel
Islands, talked a good deal about a group
in the Mediterranean.
“Minorca and Majorca are all very well,”
he said. “But stop till you see their neigh-
bouring isle, Majolica.”
Off the islands just now ; can see the long
serrated edge of Majorca, the softer out-
line of Minorca; but where is Majolica?
The keenest outlook, the most searching
quest finds no trace of it. SARK seriously
troubled. Evidently island has been
grabbed, or, to use more diplomatic lan-
guage, been annexed. But what Power
has stolen a march in the night on its
unsuspecting neighbours? SARK suspects
Bohemia, burning with desire to extend
her sea-coast and obtain in the Mediterra-
nean a coaling-station for her fleet. Thus
is the greed of the Great Powers in the
Jump at opportunity to read new work
by author of Mona Maclean, which am
glad, but not surprised, to see is in its
thirteenth edition. Fancy Windyhaugh,
Dr. MARGARET Todd's book just out, won’t
go so far. It has some of the touches of
character and description that made its
predecessor pleasant. Mr. Darsie in par-
ticular is delightful: but the heroine, Wil-
helmina Galbraith, grows a little wearisome
in her wrestlings with the truth, and her
determination towards self-sacrifice. After
all, Dr. TopD suffers chiefly by comparison
with herself. Putting Mona Maclean
aside, Windyhaugh would make its mark.
Sunday.— Since the Caledonia, the
India, and the Egypt were added to the
P. and O. fleet, the Peninsular, in her time
the crack ship, has fallen into the ranks of
the second rate. She is nevertheless un-
commonly comfortable, a splendid sea-
boat. By comparison with her swell
sisters, her bath accommodation is primi-
tive. We haven't, for example, on board
a spray bath, an arrangement of semi-
circular pipes, in the centre of which you
bath has its drawbacks. Remember the
trial trip of the first P. and O. steamer in
which it was introduced. Quite a feature
in the ship. Keen competition for its use
in the early morning. Going for it once
was beaten by a head by a dear friend
among the directors. “Won't be long,” he
said, as he disappeared within bath-room.
Presently heard fearful shriek. The ad-
venturous bather dashed out of bath-room,
his skin the colour of a boiled lobster. He
had inadvertently turned on the hot water
tap. That an accident awkward enough for
an ordinary man who, on discovering his
error, could jump out of iron circle. But
if, by reason of unruffled good temper, you
become the kind of man Othello loved—are
indeed so sleek that, entering a spray bath,
you must need insert yourself by the aper-
ture sideways—it will be understood that
withdrawal, under whatsoever pressure, is
not instantaneously accomplished.
Marseilles, Mondau.-Among constitu-
tionally idle Marseillaise the fishing indus-
try is popular. There is about it an
appearance of doing something, combined
with absolute immunity from work that is
alluring. To-day, in perfect Summer
weather, the basin outside the dock is
thronged with fisher-folk. They cluster
like bees on a jutting bastion of the quay,
every man armed with a colossal rod.
Far apart we come upon a serious-man-
nered man decently attired in black, his
grave countenance spectacled. It is , a
cloudless Summer dav, but he has brought
with him an umbrella of gampish propor-
tions. He might lay it aside whilst he
fishes; prefers to keep in touch with it;
has accordingly cunningly inserted the
handle somewhere in the neighbourhood of
the small of his back, the umbrella hanging
down partially hidden by his coat-tails.
This leaves him free to devote both hands
and undivided attention to the manipula-
tion of his fishing-gear. Its like was never
seen on sea or land. It is a net something
the shape of a stocking, fastened by the
mouth to a stick as others, seeking the
salmon at the river's mouth, use the
landing-gaff. At the hottom of the net is
a bait, and a bit of lead to cause the net to
sink. How the fish are to get in, whether
through the network, or in by the open
mouth of the stocking, does not appear. In
the limpid waters of the Mediterranean the
sunken net is plainly visible. You could
see the whole process of fish-catching if
fish were caught. But whilst we look on
breathlessly. nothing hanpens. Whether
the wary fish respect the strange net,
whether they are abashed by the spectacled
countenance overhanging it, or whether
they catch a glimpse of the umbrella pen-
dant among the coat-tails, is not known.
Certainly no fish are caught.
One enterprising sportsman has secured
an enviable coign of vantage. He has got
himself rowed out to a metal tank-like
buoy moored some fifty yards from the
quay. Here left till called for, he fishes
with rod and line. Close by is a stout
little boat just in from a coasting voyage.
Captain and crew, three all told, are taking
their breakfast cooked al fresco by the
Captain's bov. It consists chiefly of
maccaroni fished with fingers out of a
common dish. Also one stone bottle serves
for all. It has a short pragmatical spout
projecting from the middle of its bulging
side. The Captain inserts the spout in his
mouth, and holds it there whilst, with head

A NICE NIGHT AT SEA.
(Extracts from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.)
Gulf of Lyons, Friday.—The casual traveller on Continental rail-
ways, especially in France, is familiar with the official attitude
towards the hapless wayfarer. The leading idea is to make the
journey as difficult and as uncomfortable as possible. The plan is
ased on, treatment of , parcels or baggage. The passenger is
bundled about, shunted, locked up in waiting-rooms, and finally
delivered in a limp state at whatever hour and whatsoever place
may suit the convenience of the railway people. Discover the
same spirit dominant in management and arrangements of the sea
service. Steamer from Marseilles to Tunis advertised to sail to-day
at noon. On taking tickets, ordered to be on board at ten o'clock.
Why two hours before starting? Gentleman behind counter
shrugs his shoulders, hugs his ribs with his elbows, holds out his
hands with deprecatory gesture and repeats, “A dia: heures, Monsieur.”
Gestures even more eloquent than speech. Plainly mean that
unless we are alongside punctually at ten o'clock our blood, or
rather our passage, will be on our own heads. Spoils a morning;
might have gone about town till eleven o'clock; breakfasted at
leisure; sauntered on board a few minutes before noon. How-
ever, when in Marseilles chant the “Marseillaise.”
Down punctually at ten; found boat in course of loading; decks
full of dirt and noise, the shouting of men, the creaking of the
winch, the rattling of the chains. Best thing to do is to find our
cabin, stow away our baggage, and walk on the quay, always keep-
ing our eye on the boat lest she should suddenly slip her moorings
and get off to sea without us. Look out for steward. Like the
Spanish fleet, steward is not yet in sight. Roaming about below,
come upon an elderly lady, with a lame leg, an alarming squint,
and a waist like a ship's. (Never saw a ship's waist, but fancy no
mortal man could get his arm round it.). The elderly lady, who
displayed signs of asthma, tells me she is the stewardess. Ask her
where is our cabin. “Voilà,” she says. Following the direction
of her glance, I make for a berth close by. Discover I had not
made allowance for the squint; she is really looking in another di-
rection. Carefully taking my bearings by this new light, I make
for another passage; find it blocked up; stewardess explains that
they are loading the º through the floor of our
' she
i. “Tout d l'heure,’ says, with comprehensive wave of the
anol.
Nothing to be done but leave our baggage lying about, go on
deck, ºfwatch the loading. Better not leave the ship." f the
laborious Frenchmen in blouses and perspiration see our trunks,
they will certainly pop them into the hold, where all kinds of mis-
cellaneous parcels, cases and bales are being chucked without the
slightest attempt at fitting in.
quarter to twelve; only fifteen minutes now ; getting hungry;
had coffee and bread and butter early so as not to miss the boat.
Watch a man below in the hold trying to fit in a bicycle with a
four-hundredweight bale, a quarter-ton case, and a barrel of
cement. Evidently piqued at resistance offered by the apparently
frail, defenceless contrivance. Tries to bend the fore wheel so as
to accommodate the cask; that failing, endeavours to wind the
hind wheel round the case; failing in both efforts, he just lays the
bicycle loose on the top of the miscellaneous baggage aſ d the
hatch is battened down. In the dead unhappy night that followed,
when the sea was on the deck, I often thought of the bicycle
cavorting to and fro over the serrated .# of the cargo.
Ten minutes to twelve; a savoury smell from the cook's galley.
Suppose déjeuner will be served as soon as we leave the dock.
Heard a good deal of superiority of French cooking aboard ship as
jºf with British. Some compensation after all for getting
up early, swallowing cup of coffee and bread and butter, and rush-
ing off to catch at ten o'clock a ship that sails at noon. Perhaps
the cloth is laid now; better go and secure places. Find saloon.
Captain and officers at breakfast, their faces illumined with the
ecstasy born to a Frenchman when he finds an escargot on his
plate. Evidently they are breakfasting in good time so as to take
charge of the ship whilst mous autres succeed to the pleasures of the
table. What's our hour, I wonder ? Find some one who looks
like a steward; ask him; says, “ Cinq heures et demie.” A little
late that for breakfast, I diffidently suggest. Explains not break-
fast but dinner; first meal at 5.30 P.M. Can't we have déjeuner if I
pay for it? I ask, ostentatiously shaking handful of coppers in
trousers-pocket. No, he says, severely; that 's against the
réglement.
Steamer starts in seven minutes; noticed at dock-gates women
with baskets of dubious food; dash off to buy some; clutch at a
late of sandwiches, alleged to be compacted of jambon de York.

our sandwiches. “I know that Ham,” said SARK, moodily. “It

STRANGE FACT IN NATURAL HISTORY.
MR. PUNCH has been greatly puzzled by the following cryptic
paragraph which º one of the evening . lately:
“A dead donkey we know sees to the burial of field mice to serve
its private ends. In hot countries that no man has ever seen, and
Mr. GRANT ALLEN says that the carrion beetle rapid decay accounts
for the flesh . . .”
Does a deceased donkey inter field mice, either from selfish or
disinterested motives? And how can Mr. GRANT ALLEN answer for
what carrion beetles may do in hot countries that no man has ever
seen 2
Mr. Punch gives both these conundrums up—unless the answer
is that two of the lines in the paragraph have been transposed.
At the BIunt Ball.
Mr. Hardhit. Don't you think, Miss HIGHFLIER, that men look
much better in pink—less like waiters ?
Miss Highflier. Yes, but more like ring-masters—eh?

he head-master of the school which he adorns
writes: “If he leaves school now I shall have the
gravest fears as to his future. £100 is all that is
needed to complete his education."]
DEAR patient Public, ever free
To scatter wealth with lavish hand,
You do not grudge your £ s. d.
For charities you understand.
But here we have a parlous case
Of intellect most superfine,
A poet boy would win a place,
d 'mid the Rudyard Kiplings shine.
Two editors have gripped his verse,
His pedagogue his praises sounds,
Let him not go from bad to worse
In need of just one hundred pounds.
The editors in cash are weak, -
The pedagogic pounds are few,
They cannot keep this Rhythmic Freak
And so, B.P., they come to you.
The §§ he'll repay or owe it,
But think how grand, you'll nurse a Poet !
THE COMING BACK OF ARTHUR.
HERE we are again! at the Comedy
Theatre, with Mr. ARTHUR Roberts in his
old form, and also in a variety of new ones,
all of them, depend upon it, quite up to the
very latest date. His wink and his nod (by
the way, was there a “Land of Wink” as
there was indubitably a “Land of Nod'.”
for if so this eccentric comedian should be
King of the Winkers), his facial expression,
his short, crisp, º way of uttering
what may or may not be set down for him
by Messrs. DAY AND Ross, the adapters of
Milord Sir Smith, and his grotesque by-play,
are all inimitable. What matters §. plot
of a piece that has ARTHUR Roberts for
its principal exponent 2 Nothing. His ad-
miring public is satisfied if only the scenes
hang together somehow, as long as their
favourite has enough to do in every one
of them. But besides ARTHUR Roberts,
there is quaint Mr. Robert NAINBy, as
Monsieur Ligereau, who is exceedingly
funny, as is also Mr. CHARLEs WIBRow as
Major McLachlan. Miss ADA REEve, “one
of the lifes and souls” of the dramatis per-
soma, plays Celeste, and sings two capital
º “Cela va sans dire,” and “Love me
a little, Sue !" The music by that
eminent, composer, with the tongue-tyin
name of JAkobowski, is very lively an
catching, materially assisting the “go "
of the piece, which will run till it drops,
though there is little chance of any falling
off as long as it is continually being
freshened up. “A. R.” is Ar-tful.
THE GOLF-BALL AND THE SWEAR.
IDRove a golf-ball into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where
For who that sees not past his nose,
Can follow a golf-ball where it goes?
I heard a murmur in the air,
It came, I scarce could tell from where;
For who that's blind can hope to see
Where other golfers chance to be 2
Not long afterwards, in the small
Of my partner's back, I found the ball;
And the swear from beginning to end,
I found again on the lips of a friend.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR.HENRY FRowde has added the poetical
works of WHITTIER to the treasure-house of
the Oxford University Press. The dainty
volume now issued is the first complete
edition of the works of WHITTIER published
on this side of the Atlantic. That statement
suggests a bulky volume. Thanks to the
use of the Indian paper which is the
exclusive possession o §. Oxford Univer-
sity Press, the collection, in pleasantly large
type, is compressed within the limits of a
handy volume. WHITTIER is perhaps best
or, my Baronite suggests, worse known in
this country by reason of the inclusion of
many of his poems in the Congregational
Hymn Book. It is curious and painful to
see how the good deacons who compiled
that sterling work, occasionally shocked by
the overflowing charity and loving kindness
of the Quaker poet, lopped his verse, im-
roving it by variations of their own.
ven in such calamitous circumstances,
the sweet serenity, the exquisite turnin
of WHITTIER's converse are so irresistible
that the impress of the deacon's fat hand
cannot altogether smudge, its form. Here
in this dainty edition will be found the

THE bagpipes are not a peculiarly Scotch

played before Moses,” so frequently men-
tioned in Irish history, was probably of He-
brew or Egyptian extraction. The Fiddle was
invented by a Scotchman, who was of course
“First Fiddle.” This instrument, it has
been asserted, was invented by some one
living by the Deeside. There is, however,
some ground (near the river just mertioned)
for this assertion in the rebuff given to him
(Sir A.) when, on his claiming Scotch
nationality for the violin, a descendant of
the celebrated Miller of the Dee, a relation,
it is probable, of the ancient “Joe,” pooh-
poohed his statement by snapping his finger

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN OLD SONG RE-SUNG.
I'LL sing to you a good old song,
Revised and up-to-date,
Of the brand-new English gentleman
We've read about of late.
We scoff at rank and pedigree,
The vulgar rich we slate—
And Dick and ToM and HARRY
For the future each may rate
As a brand-new English gentleman
Of the progressive type.
Now surely this is better far
Than all the old parade
Of finely-drawn distinctions,
And looking down on trade.
And better, too, than levelling
All to the lowest grade.
So “Let 'em all come,” and alike
Receive the homage F.
To the brand-new English gentleman
Of the progressive type.
AUGUSTE AND LUDWIG.
AT A MUSIC HALL.
Robinson. I thought this was the best
place to come to after our little dinner. No
need to arrive before nine.
Auguste. Your little dinner was excellent,
mv dear.
}. ia. Yes well.
Rob. Glad you liked it. We can manage
a dinner in England when the dishes are
French, and the wines are French, or Ger-
man. And if we take a little water, that is
German also. Here are our seats.
Aug. Ah, I recall these chairs, some veri-
table arms-chairs, so great, so large, where
one is º at his ease, and where all
the world can to pass without to derange
those who are sitted. How call you these
places?
Rob. Oh, English music-hall man
think it's more elegant not to use Eng
so #. call these seats fauteuils.
Lud. As man say in the Fatherland, loge,
parterre, parquet.
Aug. Ah ca 1. As at us one serve himself
of the word “ticket.” All that who is Eng-
lish is enormously “smart.” We say, as in
English, “a snob,” and “a smart.”
b. That's just like French-English or
English-French. In that sense smart is
only an adjective. A smart is the pain after
a mosquito-bite.
Lud. Achsol Or after a “pin-prick."
Rob. By Jovel Yes — quite so—these
seats do give you plenty'of room.
Aug. Mon Dieu 1 Probably—oh yes—see
there that pretty woman in that lodge there:
What ravishing toilet ! What bust and
what shoulders! Et une petite nugue si
délicieuse—how say you that f
Rob. We've no word for it. We could
only say, “Such a charming little back of
the neck.”
Aug. Sapristi, quelle phrase 1 Such a
ers
h,
charming little break of the neck. Oh, la la!
Rob. No, no! “Back,” not “break.”
Aug. Charming little neck of the back.
Moi je préfère “la nugue.” Your English
phrase is, so long that she would suffice to
indicate the neck of an ostrich.
Lud. What sing they now?
Rob. I don't know. Russian, or Spanish,
or Hungarian, or something of the sort.
An Englishman can hardly ever understand
anything in an English music-hall, unless
it's in French, which it sometimes is.
Aug. And however the English boys play
a Latin piece. . Tiens ! The other day an
Mistress (having rung for dinner). “MARy, You'RE very LATE with DINNER.

Mary. “If You PLEASE, MUM, Cook AND ME was JUST sexDING off our NEw YEAR's

ISN'T IT
am goed to see the Andria at the College of
Westminster. Sapristi, what pronuncia-
tion of the Latin! I have not comprehended
one sole word. But it was very curious to
see, and the boys, played not bad. The
music during the between-acts, is it that
this was the music of the Romans ? I be-
lieved that not.
Rob. You were right. . It was the most
ºte music, chiefly from Gaiety
burlesques.
Aug. But sometimes one hears in a music
hiff, * etry of the poet of the Court, is it
not ? Ah,
you say “ Appointing to the
Queen,” Fournisseur de i. eine.
Lud. Ach so 1 Hoflieferant, Hoflichter.
Rob. The verses of the Poet Laureate, you
mean. Not often, thank goodness!
Aug. Tiens! I know the names of the
four English poets of the first rank, those of
whom the poems appear in your most great
journal, the Times. There is Reverend
EADLEY and JANE OAKLEY, who write the
more often, and AUSTIN and a certain
KIPLING. But this last I comprehend him
not often.
Rob. Nor do we, when he writes about
steam engines. But Miss OAKLEY's poetry
AUSTIN's is not. There is that difference
between them.
ug. Ah, vraiment / As that Mr. AUSTIN
must pay much more dear the printing of
his poems. . In the French journals an
announce which has not the air of an
announce costs very dear.
Lud. Why drink nobody beer here? In
Germany drink man ever beer in a such
theatre, and also very often eat man beef-
steaks or calfflesh.
Rob. Are you hungry or thirsty 2
Lud. Hungry, ah no l Not yet. And
also not extraordinary thirsty. But I would
vº willing a pair glass beer drink
ob. And you ?
Aug. Unbock 2 Eh well, I refuse him not.
Rob. Then let us go out to the bar now,
and come back before the ballet.

THE bagpipes are not a peculiarly Scotch
instrument of torture. “The Piper that
played before Moses,” so frequently men-
tioned in Irish history, was probably of He-
brew or Egyptian extraction. The Fiddle was
invented by a Scotchman, who was of course
“First Fiddle.” This instrument, it has
been asserted, was invented by some one
living by the Deeside. There is, however,
some ground (near the river just mertioned)
for this assertion in the rebuff given to him

nationality for the violin, a descendant of
the celebrated Miller of the Dee, a relation,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN OLD SONG RE-SUNG.
I'LL sing to you a good old song,
Revised and up-to-date,
Of the brand-new English gentleman
We've read about of late.
We scoff at rank and pedigree,
The vulgar rich we slate—
And DICK and ToM and HARRY
For the future each may rate
As a brand-new English gentleman
Of the progressive type.
Now surely this is better far
Than all the old parade
Of finely-drawn distinctions,
And Iooking down on trade.
And better, too, than levelling
All to the lowest grade.
So “Let 'em all come,” and alike
Receive the homage paid
To the brand-new English gentleman
Of the progressive type.
AUGUSTE AND LUDWIG.

Robinson. I thought this was the best
place to come to after our little dinner. No
need to arrive before nine.
Auguste. Your little dinner was excellent,
my dear.
Ludwig. Yes well.
Rob. §ad ou liked it. We can manage
a dinner in England when the dishes are
French, and the wines are French, or Ger-
man. And if we take a little water, that is
German also. Here are our seats.

table arms-chairs, so great, so large, where
one is º at his ease, and where all
the world can to pass without to derange
those who are sitted. How call you these
places?
Rob. Oh, English music-hall man
think it's more elegant not to use Eng
so 5. call these seats fauteuils.
Lud. As man say in the Fatherland, loge,
parterre, parquet.
Aug. #! As at us one serve himself
of the word “ticket.” All that who is Eng-
lish is enormously “smart.” We say, as in
English, “a snob,” and “a smart.”
b. That's just like French-English or
English-French. In that sense smart is
only an adjective. A smart is the pain after
a mosquito-bite.
Lud. Ach so t Or after a “pin-prick."
Rob. By Jovel Yes — quite so—these
seats do give you plenty'of room.
Aug. Mon Dieu ! Probably—oh yes—see
there that pretty woman in that lodge there:
What ravishing toilet ! What bust and

Rob. We've no word for it.
only say, “Such a charming little back of

Aug. Sapristi, quelle phrase ? Such a

Rob. No, no! “Back,” not “break.”
Aug. Charming little neck of the back.
Moi je préfère “la nugue.” Your English
phrase is so long that she would suffice to
indicate the neck of an ostrich.
Lud. What sing they now?
Rob. I don't know. Russian, or Spanish,
or #. or something of the sort.
An Englishman can hardly ever understand
anything in an English music-hall, unless
it's in French, which it sometimes is.

see, and the boys, played not bad. The
music during the between-acts, is it that
this was the music of the Romans ? I be-
lieved that not.
Rob. You were right. It was the most
inappropriate music, chiefly from Gaiety
urlesques.
#. But sometimes one hears in a music
hall the * etry of the poet of the Court, is it
not ? Ah, you say “
Appointing to the
Queen,” Fournisseur de i. eine.
Lud. Ach so t Hoflieferant, Hoflichter.
Rob. The verses of the Poet Laureate, you
mean. Not often, thank goodness!
Aug. Tiens ! I know the names of the
four English poets of the first rank, those of
whom the poems appear in your most great
journal, the Times. There is Reverend
EADLEY and JANE OAKLEY, who write the
more often, and AUSTIN and a certain
KIPLING. But this last I comprehend him
not often.
Rob. Nor do we, when he writes about
steam engines. But Miss OAKLEY's poetry
AUSTIN's is not. There is that difference
between them.
Aug. Ah, vraiment As that Mr. AUSTIN
must pay much more dear the printing of
his poems. . In the French journals an
announce which has not the air of an
announce costs very dear.
Lud. Why drink nobody beer here? In
Germany drink man ever beer in a such
theatre, and also very often eat man beef-
steaks or calfflesh.
Rob. Are you hungry or thirsty 2
Lud. Hungry, ah no l Not yet. And
also not extraordinary thirsty. But I would
very willing a pair glass beer drink.

Rob. Then let us go out to the bar now,

this was the music of the Romans ? I be-

Rob. You were right. It was the most
jºine music, chiefly from Gaiety
burlesques.

not ? Ah, you say “ Appointing to the
Queen,” Fourmisseur de i. eine.
Lud. Ach so I Hoflieferant, Hoflichter.
Rob. The verses of the Poet Laureate, you
mean. Not often, thank goodness |
Aug. Tiens ! I know the names of the
four English poets of the first rank, those of
whom the poems appear in your most great
journal, the Times. There is Reverend
EADLEY and JANE OAKLEY, who write the
more often, and AUSTIN and a certain
KIPLING. But this last I comprehend him
not often.
Rob. Nor do we, when he writes about
steam engines. But Miss OAKLEY's poetry
AUSTIN's is not. There is that difference
between them.
Aug. Ah, vraiment / As that Mr. AUSTIN
must pay much more dear the printing of
his poems. . In the French journals an
announce which has not the air of an

Lud. Why drink nobody beer here? In
Germany drink man ever beer in a such
theatre, and also very often eat man beef-
steaks or calfflesh.
Rob. Are you hungry or thirsty ?
Lud. Hungry, ah no l Not yet. And
also not extraordinary thirsty. But I would

DICK AT THE DELPHI.
THERE are features in Mr. OscAR BAR-
RETT's pantomime, which, apart from those
of the bevy of beauties engaged to represent
“The Chimes,” “City Companies,” and
“Idle Apprentices,” should render Dick
Whittington, by Mr. HoRACE LENNARD, at
the Adelphi, most attractive to the panto-
mime-loving public.
The scenery, by Messrs. BARRETT, EMDEN,
and H. B. Potts (“Paint-Potts,” of course),
is artistically good, the costumes are fanciful,
#. and elegant. The grand trans-
ormation scene º ENRY EMDEN) of “The
Triumph of Cupid,” is as effectively bril-
liant a picture as any lover of modern
Kºº. display could possibly desire.
r. BARRETT's original music is light,
tuneful, and dramatic throughout, while
the popular tunes of the day are skilfully
introduced with excellent effect.
Miss AMY AUGARDE is an operatic Dick,
and Miss MARIE Montrose a charming
Alice. It is a long time since a better cat
has been seen than Mr. O. E. LENNoN, who,
not speaking but acting, shows himself a
master of art in pantomime. Mr. Edward
LEwis, as the Idle Apprentice, is invaluable;
while Mr. GEORGERANSFORD and Mr. HARRY
RAY, as The Mate and Bo'sen, do to perfec-
tion all the “knock-about" business which
used to be associated with the Two MACs,
the twenty whacks, and the fifty smacks.
Mr. FRED EAst MAN is very funny as Cicely
the Cook. Miss MILLIE LEGARDE, as Captain
Spanker, and his sweetheart Polly, Miss
#: HARMon, with their singing and
dancing, lend material aid to the success of
the ensemble.
After the transformation scene we are
treated to two scenes of “old-fashioned and
Grimaldian Harlequinade” in which GEoRGE
DANvers and HARRY GARDNER strictly
adhere to the old-fashioned traditions of
Pantaloon and Clown. Mr. HARRY SoFTLY

36 of his 20th Volume the Sage wrote as
follows:—

“The Sisters, represented in such amicable
conjunction, are clearly Fraternity, Affec-
tion, and Business; and their description as
posters of both divisions of the globe,
evidently has reference to their presiding
over a Universal Penny Postage.
“In conclusion, Mr. Punch begs to express
his opinion that Rowland HILL, even when

SEEING IS BELIEVING.
(A Study in the Supernatural.)
TIME, about 11 P.M.; on the side of the road opposite a highly respect-
able terrace in a Suburban district, a small crowd has collected.
The gaze of all is fired expectantly upon a certain house, the
stuccoediſ. of which has a sinister and secretive air, with its
darkened windows and fanlight gleaming black in the light of a
street-lamp that flickers fitfully at every gust. There is no moon,
and great clouds are racing past in the livid sky. Most of the
crowd loiter with a slightly shamefaced air and a transparent
affectation of having merely halted for a moment in passing, and
without any particular purpose.
Mrs. Yallapp (a thin, bilious matron, to her friend Mrs. UMNEY, a
stout, comfortable dame). Well, there ain't bin much to see, so far !
Mrs. Umney. We ain't bin 'ere not above 'alf an hour. I dunno
what you expect, Mrs. YALLAPP, I'm sure!
Mrs. Yall. I expeck to be laid up with the roomatics, standin’ about
on a damp pavement like I am now.
Mrs. Umm. (optimistically). You may see somethink any minnit
now, there's no tellin'.
Mrs. Yall. If I’d come out in my thick soles, I wouldn't say a
word. But you did bustle me to that degree. I put whatever come
ºy on my feet, and there's a chill strikin' up my legs now
at
Mrs. Umm. Well, don't worry about it. Stomp your feet, Mrs.
YALLAPP, mum—or else go 'ome. I'm lettin'yer.
Mrs. Yall. (in the tone of a martyr). Now I am 'ere, I may as well
see it out. I'm not one to desert my friends.
Mrs. Umm. Don't you lay your death at my door then, because I
can take care o' myself, I can.
A New Arrival (addressing a Reticent Spectator). Anythink the

The N.A.. I can't see nothink goin' on. (Hopefully.) It ain't a
MURDER, is it?
The Ret. Spec. (oracularly). That's as may be. You wait 'ere long
enough, and you'll be as wise as me.

A still Better-inf. P. No, no, you're both wrong—it's nothink o'

The Well-inf. P. But look 'ere, the barman at the “Bull and

brass buttons with his own eyes as plain as I see you, settin' on the

The Better-inf. P. Then there's a pair of 'em, that's all, for the

ain't sayin' there mayn't be exaggerations—I don't believe it, an' I
don't disbelieve it. But it stands to reason there must be somethink
for it to git into the papers.
An Enlightened Person. It's illogical and ridiclous to lay it down
dogmatic that there can't be no ghosts... I'old there are ghosts, only
that, looked at correctly from the skientific point o' view, there
ain't anythings tural about them.

ſº during the year ended 20th June,
e Civil List, appears an entry of £225 to
IN the list of pensions
1898, and charged upon t
“Mr. WILLIAM ERNEST HANLEY in recognition of his literary
merits and his inadequate means of support.” £225 is a pretty large
slice out of an . total of £1,200. Mr. WILLIAM ERNEST
HANLEY's literary merits must be great in proportion. But who is
he, and what has he written ?, W. E. HENLEY we know (or knew)
as editor of a fractious, superior, now defunct weekly paper that
adulated ARTHUR BALFour and saw no good in GLAdstone. But
surely Mr. HANBURy, who is responsible for the issue of the Civil
Pensions List which bears his signature, cannot be so ignorant of
literary affairs as to confound a “HANLEY" with the HENLEY. It
greatly diminishes the value of a boon to be miscalled by name
when it is tossed to you.

ears his motion and behaviour, puzzled astronomers, until at last the mystery was solved by Professor
ogel, who showed that Algol had associated with him a dark star, which was invisible, and that the

HER MAJESTY'S
WHAT a delightful D'Artagnan is Mr. TREEl Hardly ever has
this versatile comedian had a character which so thoroughly suited
him, or, more correctly speaking, to which he so thoroughly suited
himself. There is fun in it, there is humour in it, there is devil-
ment in it, there is sentiment in it. To carry this character through
is a triumph for the actor. Admirably does Mr. McLEAY play the
wily Cardinal Richelieu, an historical personage most useful to
novelists and to dramatists before Mr. GRUNDY. - - - -
Anne de Breuil is an eye-making, coaxing, fascinating, Vilely
wicked heroine, without a redeeming point, except that she is
layed in a Sara Bernhardty sort of way by Mrs. BRowN Potter.
rs. TREE is a charming “poor dear” of a Queen, whose crown
is a burden to her, until it incontinently falls off as she bows her
head in an agony of tears, and wins the sympathy of her audience.
The Royal sufferings should have been relieved by a skirt-dance

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
To WILLIAM McKINLEY, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
of AMERICA.
MY DEAR SIR,--I approach you not with the conventional, if
affected, humility wº is expected of those who are privileged to
address the crowned big wigs of Europe, but with all the natural
frankness, cordiality, and ease that I can command, for I know
that, like the great majority of public men in America, you are
no pompous, inflated humbug, but a straightforward, honest,
and sincere man, one who, whatever else may be said of him, has
drawn from the free air in which he has lived a contempt for out-
worn formulas, and a simplicity of thought and manner strangely
at variance with the solemn posturings of ancient Courts.
You, Sir, occupy the highest and the noblest position that is
open to any man. By the votes of your countrymen, freely given,
ou have been raised to the head of the Government of seventy-
ve millions of free people. You have not gained a brief spell of
uneasy power by bloodshed and massacre organised for your own
advancement, nor are you President because your ancestors were
rich or great, or eminent for successful knavery. By your own
native grit you have made your way, until at last the mass of your
fellow-citizens, gave you their confidence and elected you their
executive chief.
But great as your responsibilities would necessarily be in any
case, they have been made greater by the circumstances of the time.
Those who in England have loved and admired the American
people (and I may be permitted to declare myself one of
them), who have gloried in the record of their early struggle for
freedom, though it was wrung from the obstinacy and misfortune
of England herself, who followed with sympathetic enthusiasm the
course of their fight against slavery and for the Union, and have
looked to them to carry high through the Centuries the banner of
ood Government and of civil and religious liberty, those who, even
efore the present links of affeetion and esteem were forged to bind
the two English-speaking nations together, have held by America
and all that the name implied, rejoice, no doubt, in this mutual
good will, but are forced to pause before they commit themselves
to a complete º with all that º ing from America's
recent victories. No intelligent man will, I think, deny that the
time had come to put an end to Spanish misgovernment in Cuba.
On that point we in England were Americans to a man, and
while the fight lasted, and other nations looked on with cold
indifference or undisguised enmity, we at any rate were with our
kinsfolk heart and soul. But now we hesitate. We remember
the declarations solemnly made when the war began, we still hope
it may be possible to fulfil them, but we have to admit, with an
experience of similar declarations made by ourselves and others,
that the portents give but small warrant for our hope.
And here I may acknowledge that it would be a mereimpertinence
for me or for any other man to intrude English opinion into a
question that exclusively concerns the American people. But I
note that there are many sober, earnest, and public-spirited men in
America who look with disfavour upon this new-fangled policy of
Imperial expansion for the United States. They do not seem to
hear as others do the voice of “manifest destiny” calling upon
America to govern the Philippine Islands; and to subjugate their
native inhabitants; they cannot persuade themselves that it is
necessarily good to be what is called a “world-power,” and thus to
plunge head-first into the hot bed of international jealousies; they
refuse to believe that a nation's stability and power must depend on
the number of armed men that she can array, or that it is the sign of
an inferior race to concern itself chiefly about its own affairs.
America, they say, is great because her government is based on
liberty, and because lust for glory and greed for the land of others
have never been hers. There is a cant of patriotism as offensive as
.# other cant, and its high priests go about the world º
and raving and *...ºf to cram civilisation into backwar
populations at the point of the bayonet. They call upon the world
to admire their humanity, and their disinterested love of progress,
while their pockets bulge with concessions and the prospectuses of
syndicates formed to secure a high profit for all who have skilfull
mixed pelf with patriotic sentiments. From these self-seeking but
ingenious hypocrites, the old world has suffered. Why should

For the solution of these problems you must be in a large
measure º and your position is one of no common diffi-
culty. You have yet to show that you are a strong man, strong, that
is, in the sense of impressing your own deeply-felt convictions on your
fellow-countrymen, and strong, too, in the ability to set yourself to
stem the current of pººl. º when you believe it is running
in a wrong direction. Men who have this sort of strength are not
less liable naturally to error than others, but experience shows that
on the whole they actually err more rarely and with a less
disastrous result than, those who are content to go through life
like, jelly-fish, swayed hither and thither by waves and tides.
With regard to you, it must be said that on this point we have as
yet no º for it does not of course follow that a man is
strong because he is honest, skilful, or attractive in manner, or
even because he has been able to frame a tariff carefully calculated
to support the industries of his own country, while depressin
those of rival nations. But whether you are strong or not j

hope that you are), on the decisions that you are about to take

honestly, so that when the time comes for you to seek that retire-

countrymen may honour your name and reverence your adminis.

case, they have been made greater by the circumstances of the time.
Those who in England have loved and admired the American
people (and I may be permitted to declare myself one of
them), who have gloried in the record of their early struggle for
freedom, though it was wrung from the obstinacy and misfortune
of England herself, who followed with sympathetic enthusiasm the
course of their fight against slavery and for the Union, and have
looked to them to carry high through the Centuries the banner of
É. Government and of civil and religious liberty, those who, even
efore the present links of affeetion and esteem were forged to bind
the two English-speaking nations together, have held by America
and all that the name implied, rejoice, no doubt, in this mutual
good will, but are forced to pause before they commit themselves
to a complete º with all that is springing from America's
recent victories. No intelligent man †. I think, deny that the
time had come to put an end to Spanish misgovernment in Cuba.
On that point we in England were Americans to a man, and
while the fight lasted, and other nations looked on with cold
indifference or undisguised enmity, we at any rate were with our
kinsfolk heart and soul. But now we hesitate. We remember
the declarations solemnly made when the war began, we still hope
it may be possible to fulfil them, but we have to admit, with an
experience of similar declarations made by ourselves and others,
that the portents give but small warrant for our hope.
And here I may acknowledge that it would be a mereimpertinence
for me or for any other man to intrude English opinion into a
question that exclusively concerns the American people. But I
note that there are many sober, earnest, and public-spirited men in
America who look with disfavour upon this new-fangled policy of
Imperial expansion for the United §. They do not seem to
hear as others do the voice of “manifest destiny” calling }.
America to govern the Philippine Islands; and to subjugate their
native inhabitants; they cannot persuade themselves that it is
necessarily good to be what is called a “world-power,” and thus to
plunge head-first into the hot bed of international jealousies; they
refuse to believe that a nation's stability and power must depend on
the number of armed men that she can array, or that it is the sign of
an inferior race to concern itself chiefly about its own affairs.
America, they say, is great because her government is based on
liberty, and because lust for glory and greed for the land of others
have never been hers. There is a cant of patriotism as offensive as
. other cant, and its high priests go about the world "...#
and raving and *...ºf to cram civilisation into backwar
populations at the point of the bayonet. They call upon the world
to admire their humanity, and their disinterested love of progress,
while their pockets bulge with concessions and the prospectuses of
syndicates formed to secure a high profit for all who have skilfully
mixed pelf with patriotic sentiments. From these self-seeking but
ingenious hypocrites, the old world has suffered. Why should

For the solution of these problems, you must be in a large
measure responsible, and your position is one of no common diffi-
culty. You have yet to show that you are a strongman, strong, that
is, in the sense of impressing your own deeply-felt convictions on your
fellow-countrymen, and strong, too, in the ability to set yourself to
stem the current of popular º when you believe it is running
in a wrong direction. Men who have this sort of strength are not
less liable naturally to error than others, but experience shows that
on the whole they actually err more rarely and with a less
disastrous result than those who are content to go through life
like, jelly-fish, swayed hither and thither by waves and tides.
With regard to you, it must be said that on this point we have as
yet no º for it does not of course follow that a man is
strong because he is honest, skilful, or attractive in manner, or
even because he has been able to frame a tariff carefully calculated
to support the industries of his own country, while depressin
those of rival nations. But whether you are strong or not j
one who realises America's huge power for good may be permitted to
hope that you are), on the decisions that you are about to take
depend your country's future, her place in the world, and at the
bar of history. May you decide wisely, as I doubt not you will
honestly, so that when the time comes for you to seek that retire-
ment in which a former President is but as other men, your
countrymen may honour your name and reverence your inis-
tration. I am, Sir, yours with profound respect,

his ways
And hailed a cab, and clomb therein, and sat.
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
(Being a Page from the Log-book
of Zedwhyeks.)
Not being satisfied with the very fine
distinction drawn in last week's Truth
between the numerical and historical dates
(I always thought the two were identical),
and the same writer's definition of the year
2,000 as ºf, to the two thousandth
century (a slip which he has subsequentl
attributed to the effects of Christmas ...
I determined to go to the fountain-head for

cordingly paid a visit to the Professor of
Calculation and, Chronology at , Colney
Hatch. I found the savant engaged in argu.
ment with an attendant. He broke off, how-
ever, at my approach, and, without waiting
to receive my credentials, said to me some.
what peremptorily, “Think of a number!”
“Nineteen Hundred,” I replied, thinking
aloud.
Professor DE BABBAGE at this pricked up
his ears, and appeared to take a deeper
interest in my case.
“Oh, you too have got it!” he cried.

“Yes, Master, I want to get an author:
can take my word it was so. You see, it is

“Yes, I know. I am aware that the that the year One hundred is in the Second
Astronomer Royal says that the next century century. (The first century, by the way, can
ill begin on Jan. 1, 1901—the last year well afford to do without a year or two.)
Thus 1=2, and we gain a year all round—
you take my point?”
“I see, and so 19–20, and—”
“Quite right! Before we have finished
nineteen hundred years, we are already in
the twentieth hundred. What could be
more previous?, That's what we want, my
boy, ºpush 1. We're pushing for the new
century, and people like ourselves, with our
wits about us, will get there first. As for
the others,” he continued, his voice rising to
a scream, “those who will have it that
1900 is the last year of the nineteenth cen-
tury—well, they ought to be in a lunatic
asylum !”
At this point the attendant made a
hurried communication to the professor,

(Extracts from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.)
A LovELY day in Marseilles; not a breath of wind stirred the blue
water that laved the white cliffs on which Château d'If stands.

| with cushions an 1. Scarcely outside the harbour when a
wind sprang up from S.E. dead ahead of us. The sea rose with
amazing rapidity; banks of leaden-hued clouds obscured the sun-
light; then the rain swished down; saloon deck cleared; passen-
gers congregated under shelter in the saloon; as the cranky little
| steamer rolled and pitched, the place emptied. When at 5.30 the
dinner-bell rang, only six took their places, and all declined soup.
With the darkness the storm rose. If the ship could have made
up its mind either to roll or to pitch, it could have been endured.
It had an agonising habit of leaping up with apparent intent to
pitch, and, changing its mind, rolling over, groaning in every
º; Every third minute the nose of the ship being under water,
and the stern clear out, the screw leaped full half-length in the air,
sending, forth blood-curdling sounds. Midway came a fearsome
crash of crockery, the sound reverberating above the roar of the
| wind, and the thud of the water falling by tons on the deck, making
the ship quiver like a spurred horse.
“I begin to understand now,” said SARK, “how the walls of
Jericho fell.”
Much trouble with the Generalissimo. When he came aboard at
Marseilles he suffused the ship with pleasing sense of the military
supremacy of Great Britain. Has seen more than seventy sum-

making a sort .# barricade on the offside with bolsters. A quarter
of an hour later the ship gave a terrible lurch to leeward; the
screw hoarsely shrieked; another batch of crockery crashed down;
above the uproar, a faint voice was heard moaning, “Oh, dear!

turned up at dinner last night, his moustache a little draggled, but
his port once more martial. His chief lament is, that going down
to his berth yesterday morning, having spent Friday night in the

#. out chorus of º experience. Every cabin
flooded; boxes and portmanteaus floating about. SARK and I
spent a more or less cosy night in the saloon. To us entered
occasionally one of the crew ostentatiously girt with a life-belt.
Few incidents so soothing on such a night. Fortunately, we did not
hear till entering port how in the terror of the night two conscripts,
bound for Bizerta, jumped overboard and were seen no more.
“If this is the way they usually get to Tunis,” says SARK, “I
hope the French will keep it all to themselves. In this particular
case, there is more in the MARKiss's ‘graceful concession' than
meets the eye.”

IN Love among the Lions (DENT & Co.), Mr. T. ANstEy, in his
very best style, tells us the story of a commonplace young man
placed in a most awkward predicament by the eccentric girl
with whom he is desperately in love. “If it's humour you
want,” says the Baron to his friends, quoting, of course, from Mr.
BRANDON THoMAs in the Pantomime Rehearsal, “just get this
story of Mr. ANSTEY's, and you will be kept amused and interested
for a good couple of hours by ‘Shrewsbury clock,” or any other
the individuality of the characters. Of course, the Baron wishes
that there were more stories of the same sort in the one volume,
but, on reflection, this one is so uncommonly “hard to beat” that
Mr. ANSTEY might have failed, as his own rival, had he introduced
two or three others just to make a show. Love among the Lions is
well worthy of the author of the inimitable Vice Versd.
Mrs. RichMond Ritchie's Biographical edition of her father's
works, which SMITH, ELDER have planned on a scale of thirteen
volumes, reaches the ninth. It comprises the Christmas Books,
and in addition to the letterpress contains ninety-seven full-page
illustrations, one hundred and twenty-two woodcuts, and a fac-
simile letter. (The handwriting, by the way, in its clearness and
neatness strangely resembles that of THAcker AY's old friend and
sometime publisher, the head of the firm now endowing the world
with this treasure trove.) The Christmas Books were opportunely
issued before the festival. But the work is for all time. Mrs.
RitchTE continues to add to the value of the edition by copious
notes and reminiscences of her father, supplemented by letters
from his pen, now for the first time given to the public. The
volume contains an exceptional number of the sketches that
THAcKERAY tossed off even with greater pleasure than he laboured
at the folios of Vanity Fair. The collection of Christmas Books
includes Mrs. Perkins's Ball, of which SMITH, ELDER have just ||
issued a facsimile of the original edition, with its quaint coloured

the Ring.
The Green Passion (GREENING), by P. VERT, and this, as far as
names go, is quite as it should be, and they are “all in a concate-
nation accordingly.” It is a story of an Othello in petticoats whose
lunatic jealousy poisons her married life, and makes her manly
i.d utterly miserable. There it ends. The mechanism of the
tale will jiº, recall to the memory of any regular reader of
novels the original work in which chapters of private conversation
with “My Dear Diary” furnished the medium through which the
sentiments, feelings, designs, and doings of the Heroine, and also of
the other characters, were communicated to the public.

IN Love among the Lions (DENT & Co.), Mr. T. ANSTEy, in his
very best style, tells us the story of a commonplace young man
placed in a most awkward predicament by the eccentric girl
with whom he is desperately in love. “If it's humour you
want,” says the Baron to his #i. quoting, of course, from Mr.
BRANDON THoMAs in the Pantomime Rehearsal, “just get this
story of Mr. ANSTEY's, and you will be kept amused and interested
for a good couple of hours by ‘Shrewsbury clock,” or any other
the individuality of the characters. Of course, the Baron wishes
that there were more stories of the same sort in the one volume,
but, on reflection, this one is so uncommonly “ hard to beat” that
Mr. ANSTEY might have failed, as his own rival, had he introduced
two or three others just to make a show. Love among the Lions is
well worthy of the author of the inimitable Vice Versd.
Mrs. RichMond Ritchie's Biographical edition of her father's
works, which SMITH, ELDER have i. on a scale of thirteen
volumes, reaches the ninth. It comprises the Christmas Books,
and in addition to the letterpress contains ninety-seven full-page
illustrations, one hundred and twenty-two woodcuts, and a fac-
simile letter. (The handwriting, by the way, in its clearness and

sometime publisher, the head of the firm now endowing the world
with this treasure trove.) The Christmas Books were opportunely
issued before the festival. But the work is for all time. Mrs.

notes and reminiscences of her father, supplemented by letters
from his pen, now for the first time given to the public. The
volume contains an exceptional number of the sketches that

TO A NOVELIST OF THE MODERN
SCHOOL.
[“The present pessimistic and hopeless kind of

know what life was, was not going to last.”—Mr.
David Christie Murray at the Article Club.]
FAIR novelist, whose youthful pen,
Steeped in the dismal style prevailing,"
To unsophisticated men 2 **u
Life's dubious mysteries unveiling,
With fervid fancy's seared and scarred,
A-throb with pessimistic hurry,
The laws alike you disregard
Of DAvid and of LINDLEY MURRAY.
For us, who in the world have spent
Some scores of winters—often wasted—
While, on life's pathway as we went,
Its pleasant fruits we oft have tasted,
You, preternaturally wise,
In saddest, gloomiest effusions,
Strip off existence's disguise—
For you at least have no illusions.
Yet at the worst we fain would hope—
Though, judging thus the world unkindly,
You drag us with you as you grope
Amid its mazes madly, blindly,
And teach us everywhere to see
Horrors and miseries in plenty—
That, gentle maiden, you may be
Wiser perhaps when you are twenty.
CUTTING REMARKs.—John MILNE, pub-
lisher, advertises an “Eacpress Series,” where-
of Major ARTHURGRIFFITHs' Rome Expressis,
naturally, the first on the list now before us:
But what is the use of an “Erpress Series”
when the reader, becoming interested, wish-
ing to get on at express pace, is stopped by the
obstacles of uncut pages at nearly every turn-
over? “Cut the book before you read it,” says
Mr. SAPIENT. In what sort of temper does
the exhausted paper-cutter sit down to read?
There may be, and probably there are,
reasons satisfactory to the publishers why
some books should be cut and others uncut.
But all novels intended to be rapidly read
should have their pages cut before publica-
tion.
A NICE NIGHT AT SEA.
(Extracts from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.)
A LovELY day in Marseilles; not a breath of wind stirred the blue
water that laved the white cliffs on which Château d'If stands.
Shall have a lovely passage. Make ourselves comfortable on deck
with cushions and books. Scarcely outside the harbour when a
wind sprang up from S.E. dead ahead of us. The sea rose with
amazing rapidity; banks of leaden-hued clouds, obscured the sun-
light; then the rain swished down; saloon deck cleared; passen-
gers congregated under shelter in the saloon; as the cranky little
| steamer rolled and pitched, the place emptied. When at 5.30 the
| dinner-bell rang, only six took their places, and all declined soup.
With the darkness the storm rose. If the ship could have made
up its mind either to roll or to pitch, it could have been endured.
It had an agonising habit of leaping up with apparent intent to
pitch, and, changing its mind, rolling over, groaning in every
º; Every third minute the nose of the ship being underwater,
and the stern clear out, the screw leaped full half-length in the air,
sending, forth blood-curdling sounds. Midway came a fearsome
crash of crockery, the sound reverberating above the roar of the
wind, find the thud of the water falling by tons on the deck, making
the ship quiver like a spurred horse.
“I be to understand now,” said $ARK, “how the walls of
Jericho fell.”
Much trouble with the Generalissimo. When he came aboard at
Marseilles he suffused the ship with pleasing sense of the military
supremacy of Great Britain. Has seen more than seventy sum-
mers, but still walks with sprightly step and head erect. The long

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE best chapters of the Life and LettersW. Lewis Carroll (FISHER
UNwin) are the two concluding ones. My Baronite, regretfully
recognises the reason in the fact that they contain least of the
writing of STUART DoDGson Collingwood, B.A., Christ Church,
Oxford, who has dutifully undertaken the task of writing the life of
his uncle. There were two people connected with the creation of
Alice in Wonderland. One was Lewis CARRoll, the other the
Bev. C. L. DoDGson. In personality º were wider apart than
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The Rev. Mr. Dodgson recognised
this fact to the extent that he was exceedingly angry if any well-
meaning admirer of LEwis CARRol.I.'s masterpieces mixed up the
identity of the author with the majesty of the College, Don. The
fault of the work is that Nephew Collingwood has in his story
struck the note of the somewhat stodgy Uncle DoDGson, to the ob-
scuration of the daintier music of the inimitable Lewis CARRoll.
In chapters ten and eleven we have the author of Alice in Wonder-
land either writing himself or written about by some of his child-
friends. The result indicates what might have been done with
such a subject in defter hands. As it is, let us be thankful for the
study presented. It is effective in its way as :::::::: from what
dry gourd of College Donship may spring delightful flowers of
boldest fancy. Even when tied and bound in mortar-board and
professional gown, the Rev. C. L. Dodgson occasionally lapses
into bold speech, “More and more it seems to me,” he writes to
a young friend, “that what a person is, is of more importance in
God's sight than merely what proposition he affirms or denies.”
That seems to lay the axe to the root of all professional preaching
from pulpits whether in University or town.
Amateur Clubs and Actors (ARNoLD), by W. G. ELLIOT, Editor,
and talented assistants, is to those intimately and principally con-
cerned, an interesting work, and to many “friends in front” as
amusing as interesting. Among Mr. ELLIot's collaborators
jº. the name of TARVER, uniquely associated with the teaching
of French and the maintenance of a “Dame's" house, at Eton.
Mr. TARVER, without going back to the dark ages, might easily
have acquired the not very recondite information that FRANk
TALFourd wrote his first burlesque, Macbeth, at Eton, which
was subsequently amplified and played by “little Robson.”
Perhaps, too, it may be news to Mr. TARVER to be informed
“pupil room,” and patronised by “my tutor” and a considerable
audience. On the first occasion was performed Bombastes
Furioso, whence the youth who played Artaraminous obtained the
soubriquet of “His Majesty;” and on the second occasion was
played a farce called Guy Fawkes Day, written by the aforesaid
representative of Artaraminous, aged sixteen, printed at Windsor,
a copy of which is now in the collection of a friend of the Baron's.
Mr #. record of theatricals at Cambridge takes up the
thread of the narrative where the Founder of the Club dropped
it in his Reminiscences of the A. D. C. (CHAPMAN AND HALL). This
ortion of the work is capitally done, as is also the Fº of “The
xford Movement" in the dramatic direction. The “Old Stagers”
of Canterbury, the “Windsor Strollers,” the Guards, the West-
minster Play, and Country House Amateurs, have special chapters
all to themselves, which was a wise move on the part of Editor and
publishers. Altogether Amateur Clubs and Actors is an amusing
chronicle.
My Baronite chanced to open Irish Life and Character (Hodder
AND SToughton) at the chapter chronicling their development in
the House of Commons. e found, what he is sure is not an
accurate presentation of “Irish Character,” that the author, Mr.
MICHAEL MAcDoNAGH, has been looting Mr. HENRY Lucy's Diaries
of Parliament, “conveying" many of their good things, and
presenting them as his own. In two cases he has not even been
at the trouble to disguise the enterprise by varying the phrasing.
This discovery checked desire for further reading of the volume.
In his powerful romance, entitled, Ashes of Empire (MACMILLAN
& Co.), M. Robert W. CHAMBERs gives us, during the turbulence
of the Revolution, and amid the awful crash and carnage that
followed immediately upon the flight of the Empress Eugénie, and
reached their climax just before the triumphantentry of the Germans
into Paris, a touching story, admirably told, of true self-sacrificing
love. The heroines are two sweet and gentle Bretonnes; the heroes,
a couple of war correspondents, one English and the other Ameri-
can, young, clear-headed, manly, courageous, a very DAMoN and
PYTHIAs in their attachment to each other, chivalrous in their love
and uncompromising in their duty. The fearful scenes of those last
days of deadly famine and sanguinary riot in Paris, when, within
the walls, there were mercenary traitors and foreign spies in league
with the victorious foe without, are here vividly and unspar-
ingly depicted. The complex, animal-like character of "the

drawn from the very life by a master hand. Then the booming of
cannon, the rattling of musketry and of mitrailleuse cease as if
by magic; to the awful storm succeeds a profound calm, and with
it, after a while, come rest of body, peace of mind, and the content-
ment of rewarded love. At last the haven where they would be is
reached; there is in store a bright future for the principal person-
es of this brilliantly-written story, in whose fate the reader,
while tracking their i.º.º. through the gruesome
scenes of this second Reign of Terror, has become intensely, nay,
breathlessly, interested. Emphatically is Ashes of Empire recom-
mended by THE BARON DE B.-W.
MY LORD AND MY LADY.
Longere this date, when the comedy is nearing its three hundredth
performance, all theatre-goers, certainly all Avenue Theatre-goers,
of London will have made the acquaintance of Mr. CART.on's Lord
and Lady Algy, a play that will bear seeing twice. ...Regretting;
as we do on the occasion of our visit, the sudden indisposition of
Miss CoMPton, we cannot but congratulate Miss BARTLETT on her
excellent rendering, presumably at short notice, of the part of Lady
Algy, a most telling rôle, that stands out by the great opportunities
given it, not so much for acting, but for always coming in at the
right moment and quietly carrying off the palm after others have
been bearing the burden of the action.
Mr. CHARLEs HAwtREy's impersonation of Lord Algy would carry
through triumphantly a less interesting play than this. His quiet
method is perfect. Ars est celare artem is Mr. CHARLEs HAWTREy's
motto. #. rendering of the tipsily-fuddled scene in Act II. is
artistically restrained. The author, Mr. CART.on, must be an un-

MY LORD AND MY LADY.
Longere this date, when the comedy is nearing its three hundredth
performance, all theatre-goers, certainly all Avenue Theatre-goers,
of London will have made the acquaintance of Mr. CART.on's Lord
and Lady Algy, a play that will bear seeing twice. ... Regretting,
as we do on the occasion of our visit, the sudden indisposition of
Miss CoMPToN, we cannot but congratulate Miss BARTLETT on her
excellent rendering, presumably at short notice, of the part of Lady
Algy, a most telling rôle, that stands out by the great opportunities
given it, not so much for acting, but for always coming in at the
right moment and quietly carrying off the palm after others have
been bearing the burden of the action.
Mr. CHARLEs HAwtrey's impersonation of Lord Algy would carry
through triumphantly a less interesting P. than this. His quiet
method is perfect. Ars est celare artem is Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREy's
motto. s rendering of the tipsily-fuddled scene in Act II. is
artistically restrained. The author, Mr. CART.on, must be an un-
commonly bold man to have raided the School for Scandal and
coolly º: SHERIDAN's Discovery-of-Lady-Teazle scene,
only without the screen, in his third act. Well, it is not the first
. of the masterpiece, and it will not be the last. But
each attempt, and we remember a notable one at the St. James's,
only shows how unapproachable is the original.

LORD GR-MTH-RPE'S COMMENTARIES.
[Note.—Mr. Punch has made arrangements with the above celebrated
letter writer for an occasional contribution dealing with matters of public
interest. The noble Lord, however, does not wish to have his full name
given, lest the editor of the Times should be jealous. The condition thus
imposed upon him Mr. Punch has scrupulously observed.]
No. I.-Lord G. on THE WEATHER.
Sir, Mr. HARRIsoN says, which is a remarkable thing for Mr.
HARRIsoN to do, I never having given him any warrant to suppose
it even for a moment, but of course it is all the same to men of
that stamp who cannot conceive where the point (but they never
have a point) comes in just as if you were to ask which no man of
sense would think of doing an ordinary Archbishop to sweep up the
drawing room floor with a poker but I should refuse under 27 & 28
Vic. Cap 201, Section, 15 not being an Archbishop myself that I
have committed myself (memet ipsum commisi, but it ought to be in
the oblique narration which I have forgotten since I used to do it
at school and not at all badly either).
Now let me ask Mr. HARRIson who in private life is I suppose a
Mayor or an Alderman or a County or even Privy Councillor or
something equally ridiculous though I don't wish to be in the least
offensive to him not knowing him from ADAM and not wanting to a
erfectly plain question and I hope they will be able to answer it
or him without any more nonsense which we are all getting pretty
well accustomed to during these stormy days which § enjoy more
than most men of my (but I'm not as old as all that) age. I
remember more than twenty years ago there was a judgment of
the Court of Arches to that effect when Lord PENZANCE stated as
emphatically as they could that whoever took it but of course as I
said at the time nobody dreamt of taking it it couldn't be justified
for a moment or even much longer which seems to me to settle
that matter or bundle of matters whichever you like quite

reads rubrics upside down and crams chasubles and copes down our
throats without asking us if they or we or any of us like that kind

these fools' arguments in that way in order to bring them to book—
that sea water in a state of violent commotion could possibly make
any one let alone an ordained priest of the Church of England
much drier than he was before which wasn't much when you come
to think of it in that way.
If Mr. HARRISON wants to write to you any more I suggest that
he had better talk to me first and then I promise to tell #. after
he has written his letter why I don't mean to agree with him and

DoN'T BUY A HoRSE BECAUSE HE IS DESCRIBED As BEING
'INTS ON 'UNTING, BY 'ARRY.
‘WELL KNOWN WITH THE – HouſNDS.”
º
It MIGHT BE TRUE.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE best chapters of the Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll (FISHER
UNwin) are the two concluding ones. My Baronite, regretfully
recognises the reason in the fact that they contain least of the
writing of STUART DoDGson Collingwood, B.A., Christ Church,
Oxford, who has dutifully undertaken the task of writing the life of
his uncle. There were two people connected with the creation of
Alice in Wonderland. One was LEwis CARRoll, the other the
Bev. C. L. DoDGson. In personality they were wider apart than
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The Rev. §. DoDGson recognised
this fact to the extent that he was exceedingly angry if any well-
meaning admirer of LEWIS CARRol,L's masterpieces mixed up the
identity of the author with the majesty of the College, Don. The
fault of the work is that Nephew Collingwood has in his story
struck the note of the º: stodgy Uncle DoDGson, to the ob-
scuration of the daintier music of the inimitable Lewis CARRoll.
In chapters ten and eleven we have the author of Alice in Wonder-
land either writing himself or written about by some of his child-
friends. The result indicates what might have been done with
such a subject in defter hands. As it is, let us be thankful for the
study presented. It is effective in its way as § from what
§. gourd of College Donship may spring delightful flowers of
boldest fancy. Even when tied and bound in mortar-board and
professional gown, the Rev. C. L. Dodgson occasionally lapses
into bold speech, “More and more it seems to me,” he writes to
a young friend, “that what a person is, is of more importance in
God's sight than merely what proposition he affirms or denies.”
That seems to lay the axe to the root of all professional preaching
from pulpits whether in University or town.
Amateur Clubs and Actors (ARNoLD), by W. G. ELLIOT, Editor,
and talented assistants, is to those intimately and º con-
cerned, an interesting work, and to many “friends in front” as
amusing as interesting. Among Mr. ELLIot's collaborators
jº. the name of TARVER, uniquely associated with the teaching
of French and the maintenance of a “Dame's " house, at Eton.
Mr. TARVER, without going back to the dark ages, might easily
have acquired the not very recondite information that FRANK
TALFourd wrote his first burlesque, Macbeth, at Eton, which
was subsequently amplified and Rºyº. by “little Robson.”
Perhaps, toº, it may be news to Mr. TARVER to be informed
“pupil room,” and patronised by “my tutor” and a considerable
audience. . On the first occasion was performed Bombastes
Furioso, whence the youth who played Artaraminous obtained the
soubriquet of “His Majesty;” and on the second occasion was
played a farce called Guy #wº Day, written by the aforesaid
representative of Artaraminous, aged sixteen, printed at Windsor,
8. º of which is now in the collection of a friend of the Baron's.
Mr. ELLIoT's record of theatricals at Cambridge takes up the
thread of the narrative where the Founder of the Club dro Red
it in his Reminiscences of the A. D. C. (CHAPMAN AND HALL). #.
§. of the work is capitally done, as is also the Fº of “The
xford Movement" in the dramatic direction. The “Old Stagers.”
of Canterbury, the “Windsor Strollers,” the Guards, the West-
minster Play, and Country House Amateurs, have special chapters
all to themselves, which was a wise move on the part of Editor and
publishers. Altogether Amateur Clubs and Actors is an amusing
chronicle.
My Baronite chanced to open Irish #. and Character (Hodder
AND SToughton) at the chapter chronicling their development in
the House of Commons. #. found, what he is sure is not an
accurate presentation of “Irish Character,” that the author, Mr.
MICHAEL MAcDoNAGH, has been looting Mr. HENRY LUCY's Diaries
of Parliament, “conveying ” many of their good things, and
presenting them as his own. In two cases he has not even been
at the trouble to disguise the enterprise by varying the phrasing.
This discovery checked desire for further reading of the volume.
In his ſº. romance, entitled, Ashes of Empire (MACMILLAN
& Co.), Mr. Robert W. CHAMBERs gives us, during the turbulence
of the Revolution, and amid the awful crash and carnage that
followed immediately upon the flight of the Empress Eugénie, and
reached their climax just before the triumphant entry of the Germans
into Paris, a touching story, admirably told, of true self-sacrificing
love. The heroines are two sweet and gentle Bretonnes; the heroes,
a couple of war correspondents, one English and the other Ameri-
can, young, clear-headed, manly, courageous, a very DAMoN and
PYTHIAs in their attachment to each other, chivalrous in their love
and uncompromising in their duty. The fearful scenes of those last
days of deadly famine and sanguinary riot in Paris, when, within
the walls, there were mercenary traitors and foreign spies in league
with the victorious foe without, are here vividly and unspar-
ingly depicted. The complex, animal-like character of “the

no originality about grown-ups. Why, I ask pathetically, why

SIR,--I see that somebody, who styles
himself an expert, but who tells the most
monstrous lies, has been writing to the
papers to attack the unsurpassed scientific
work of my wonderful book, The Marvellous
Land; or, The Marvellous Landor. I need
hardly say that I am the greatest mountain
climber in the world. As for the drivelling
º of the Alpine Club, they know nothing
at all.
I came down the Banshee Pass, a sheer
descent of four miles and a half, an absolutel
vertical precipice, in twelve seconds, and,
what is more, I did it on my head. I did not
count the stoppages, but none of them
lasted long. . Fortunately, I landed in a
crevasse filled with snow two thousand feet
deep. I never use nailed boots, staffs,
ropes, and such old women's contrivances.
On the Banshee Peak I wore only my usual
mountain dress— }. and pumps. I
did not feel cold, although my thermometer

zero. What is more remarkable, it fell
during my descent.
As I was coming down. I prepared my

my telescope form my entire equipment of

whether the Banshee was a pass, a peak, or
a plain, but the trifling difference between
the three is unworthy of notice.
I intended to lecture before the British
Association, but M. DE Rouge Mont fore-
stalled me. His scientific achievements
almost bear comparison with mine.

YER PRoposes to speND THE REMAINDER of YER 'OLIDAYs, EH !"
IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE.
IN the Times of January 16, a despatch from the excellent
“Own Correspondent” of that journal, resident in St. Petersburg,
was published, giving the TsAR's peace proposals. . As some of his
Imperial Majesty's items are rather in the rough, perhaps they
may be reconsidered. At any rate, Mr. Punch (who is entirely in
accord with the Emperor's wish for peace) submits a few sugges-
tions that may lead to an improvement in an exceedingly interest-
ing document.
1. As the Powers interested are not quite ready for any violent
or radical change affecting the increase or decrease of armaments,
the coming into operation of any provisions regulating the same
may be ... for some reasonable time—say a thousand years.
If at the end of that period there should still be cause for disagree-
ment, a further postponement may be arranged. Of course, any
one power may be at liberty to adopt the proposals at once, but
Russia would, in any event, reserve her liberty of action.
2. The means of reducing a war budget fortunately presents no
great difficulty. All that is necessary is a slate and sponge. The
Sulill .. (in advance) might be written on the slate and then
washed off with the sponge. This in the new War Game would be
counted as one to the borrower and a loss to the lender. Russia
would willingly act as a pioneer to show “how the thing could be
done” by borrowing of her neighbours (France for choice), and
then wiping out the score, to her personal advantage.
3. XPnew weapons to be interdicted, and a return to pop-guns
encouraged. Inventors to be prosecuted and confined in a prison
(that Russia would willingly put at their disposal), and their
plans, &c., to be taken to St. Petersburg, for safe custody, with a
view to preventing them being used to the disadvantage of the
human race. Powder to remain where it is. Pink powder to be
prohibited because this has had disastrous effects chez les femmes.
4. Explosives of terrible force to be restricted. The distribution
of orange-peel to be forbidden, as many accidents have occurred
through carelessness on the part of the peelers. No love-letters,
cause great explosions in domestic households—when they have
fallen into the hands of those for whom they were not originally
intended. Crackers of all sorts (except those made in Russia for
toº consumption) to be regarded with suspicion.
5. The use of submarine torpedo-boats or plungers, and any
other similar engines of destruction, to be prohibited. All sailors
will be required to wear life-belts, and will not be allowed to go to
sea when there is a chance of “dirty weather.” Plungers (from
foreign countries) will be tolerated at baccaratin St. Petersburg on
certain conditions, the main of which will be ample resources,
habitual ill-luck, and no knowledge of the game.
6. All the Powers to undertake not to construct vessels with
rams. For the benefit of her neighbours, Russia will accept an ex-
emption from this rule, so that she may keep abreast of modern
scientific research.
7. The Geneva Convention of 1864 to appl
armies. Great Britain to commence the ºś. ordinance as
an object lesson for the other Powers. The time for the others to
master the details to be left to individual personal convenience.
8. The revision of the declaration concerning the laws and cus-
toms of war, elaborated in 1874, by the conference of Brussels, to
be revised and referred back for revision. When the revision
(which remains unratified to this day) has been again revised, then
the ratification to await revision. The date of the final ratification
to follow as soon as convenient the date of these proposals coming
into force.
9. The offers of employment of arbitration to be accepted in
principle. Should events assume a serious aspect between England
and France, then all British vessels (by order of the Emperor of
Russia) should be commanded by French Admirals. The crews of
the said British vessels should voluntarily put themselves into
irons, and only lend a hand when requested by the French sailors
in cases of emergency, such as avoiding collision with a lighthouse,
&c. The French Admirals would then bring the British Fleet
into a Russian port, and after the consumption of a “grog" drained
in honour of the union between France and Russia, would proceed
to Paris overland. During these pleasant proceedings, the Mar-
seillaise and the Russian Imperial Hymn would be played alter-
mately and incessantly.
to navies as well as
10. To carry the above Fº (9) into effect it is necessary that
there should be an understanding, as to its application. It is sug-
gested that in the event of the slightest º, occurring,
all British ships, from the men-o’-war to the fishing-smack or plea-
sure rowing-boat, should be handed over to Russia for safe custody.
11. To avoid unnecessary cause for international offence, all words
of European dictionaries. “Rosbif,” “Milord SMITH,” “Froggies."
|. “Monsoos” (any European other than a Briton), to
e deemed obsolete. Russia to retain, with the consent of Mr. Punch
(on the understanding that there is to be no tomfoolery with the
out ’’ anything she doesn't like or understand. is concession is
made on the distinct understanding that it is impossible to give
brains to ſº born without them.
12. And lastly, nothing touching the political relation of States,
or the actual order of things as .. by treaties, to be
examined, Germany to retain Alsace and Lorraine, Russia to have
all that she wishes, and France what she can get—subject to self-
imposed inaction: Great Britain, to agree to anything and every-
thing on the understanding_(backed up by her Army and Fleet)
King of Europe and the Emperor of the World, otherwise known
as Mr. Punch.
MAD QUESTIONS.
(Possibly arranged by the Lunatic suggested by Mr. R–d K—g.)
1. WHEN was Australia discovered, and why were the natives
called Austrians before it was inhabited ?
2. Explain the composition of the Powers in special regard to
the consumption of green cheese.
3. Who was JULIUS CAESAR, and why did he eat oysters at
Colchester after the battle of Hastings?
4. Why is the earth supposed to be round when the British
flag flies everywhere?
5. If a herring and a half costs three-halfpence, what should be
the market price of half-a-dozen crocodiles and a hippopotamus 2
6. Give your reasons (in blank verse) for supporting the candi-

By every streamlet's winding course,

O Sybaritish Age! O day
Of self-indulgence and decay !
Their crusted sires had sooner died
Than so demean their honest pride,

Has lost its terror, why, what hope

SIGNS OF IMPROVING TRADE.
SO COURTLY.
INTERESTING plot, acting good, scenery artistically effective, and
costumes perfect. Such must be the public verdict on A Court
Scandal, [adapted from a French play, dating back some forty years
ago,and called,if Iremember jº, Premières.Armes º:
by Messrs. AUBREY BoucICAULT and Osmond SHILLING Ford. It
would be difficult to find a better representative of the youthful
Duc de Richelieu, aged nineteen, than K. SEYMoUR Hicks, though
º his young Duchess, as represented by Miss DoRothea
AIRD, is somewhat lacking in the artificial grace which is accepted
as the special characteristic of the Court of Louis THE FIFTEENTH.
Miss MIRIAM CLEMENTs makes a stately Duchesse de Bourgogne, and
sufficiently emphasies the note of genuine feeling j redeems
this character from the charge of heartless coquetry.
If Mr. ALLAN AYNEsworth, as the Chevalier *śation, would
only subdue his apparently º and hopelessly convulsing
laughter at º particular on every occasion, so that one
begins to wonder what on earth it is, in the action, the situation,
or in anything that he or any one else has said, he finds so
intensely amusing, his impersonation would leave nothing to be
desired. In the last act, during the duel, he is excellent; so also is
Mr. SEYMoUR HIcks as the Duc.
Mr. BRANDoN THoMAs is marvellously made up and amusing as
the Baron de Bellechasse, being ably seconded by Miss FLORENCE
Wood, some of whose scenes are genuine comedy. Mr. J. D.
BEVERIDGE's Abbé de Chavanne is, in its quiet way, a masterpiece;
nothing in the play marks the epoch so distinctly as does this
character of the Abbé, played as it is here by Mr. BEveRIDGE.
Miss ETHEL. MATTHEws, as Césarine de Nocé, is a fascinating
court-lady, and Miss R. LE THIERE pourtrays the proud an
unprincipled mother-in-law, Madame la Duchesse de Noailles, in a
manner that must make every married man in the audience thank
his stars that he has not been induced to marry into a family of
which this strong-minded autocrat is the head.
A Court (Theatre) Scandal, like any other scandal, must be
talked about all over town. The play has only to arouse curiosity,

EARLY one morning, just as the Court was sitting,
I heard a Junior whimpering, all in the second row:

“Remember the vows that you made in consultation,

Oh, don't deceive me,§: don't go and leave me,
How can you go and treat a poor Junior so 2
“Supposing that the Judge should become a little testy,
Suppose the Jury restive—what consequence might flow !
Oh |. deceive me,*. don't go and leave me,
How can you go and treat a poor Junior so 2 ''
Thus sang a poor Junior, his sorrows a-bewailing,
Thus sang a poor Junior all in the second row:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Selah Harrison (MACMILLAN & §: by Mr. MACNAUGHTAN, is a
remarkable book. It is an admirably and simply, told story of a
religious hero, a Scotchman (as his nationality ought to be, seeing
it is written by one MAc and published by another—“The twº
Macs”), a self-sacrificing episcopalian clergyman, who in England
first devotes himself to the service of heathenist hop-pickers, and |
then conquering his amatory passion for the § lady with whom
he has }. desperately in love, he risks his life in order to convert
the savages on a cannibal island. But for his loye for one woman
and his marriage with another he might have been a kind of St.
FRANCIs XAvTER. The story is so convincingly written as to seem
less a romance than a narrative of actual facts. . - -
Considering that Mr. HARRY QUILTER, “Barrister-at-law,” is, as
far as concerns black-and-white art, only an amateur, it is wonder-
ful what an amount of careful, painst ing work he has been able
to achieve in his ornamental edition of Robert BRowNING's Pied
Piper, written in black letter by “MARY his wife,” and printed and
published apparently by Himself, HARRY QUILTER; for as far as the
eagle eye of the Baron can see, there is no sign of any printer's or
publisher's name and address appearing on the first or last page of
the edition de lure. For the Baron to criticise such a book from a
rofessional art stand-point would be of course ungenerous. Suf-
§. it therefore to say that some of the decorative borders, es:
pecially the one where the rats, frogs, and bats are inter-worked,
are remarkable both for design and execution. The “Barrister-at-
law” must have had a vast amount of spare time on his hands,
when he is able to devote days, may months, or even years, to such
laborious work. The professional “Barrister-at-law "proves him-
self an amateur Draughtsman. -
There is just issued from the Qxford Press, and my Baronite
suspects that no other agency could adequately perform the deli-
cate work, a reproduction of certain famous engravings in the
University Galleries at Oxford and in the British Museum.,,. They
comprise “Ars Moriendi,” the work of “the Master E. S.” The

would be difficult to find a better representative of the youthful
Duc de Richelieu, aged nineteen, than Mr. SEYMoUR HIcks, though
lº. his young Duchess, as represented by Miss DoRothea
AIRD, is somewhat lacking in the artificial grace which is accepted
as the special characteristic of the Court of Louis THE FIFTEENTH.
Miss MIRIAM CLEMENTs makes a stately Duchesse de Bourgogne, and
sufficiently emphasies the note of genuine feeling which redeems
this character from the charge of heartless coquetry.

only subdue his apparently º: and hopelessly convulsing

begins to wonder what on earth it is, in the action, the situation,
or in anything that he or any one else has said, he finds so
intensely amusing, his impersonation would leave nothing to be
desired. In the last act, during the duel, he is excellent; so also is
Mr. SEYMoUR HIcks as the Duc.
Mr. BRANDoN THoMAs is marvellously made up and amusing as
the Baron de Bellechasse, being ably seconded by Miss FLORENCE
Wood, some of whose scenes are genuine comedy. Mr. J. D.
BEVERIDGE's Abbé de Chavanne is, in its quiet way, a masterpiece;
nothing in the play marks the epoch so distinctly as does this
character of the Abbé, played as it is here by Mr. BEveRIDGE.
Miss ETHEL MATTHEws, as Césarine de Nocé, is a fascinating
court-lady, and Miss R. LE THIERE pourtrays the proud and

manner that must make every married man in the audience thank

“Remember the vows that you made in consultation,

Oh, don't deceive me, please don't go and leave me,
How can you go and treat a poor Junior so?
“Oh, bad are the pleadings, and many are the pitfalls,
And shaky are the proofs, and the witnesses may go!
Oh, don't deceive me, please don't go and leave me,
How can you go and treat a poor Junior so 2
“Supposing that the Judge should become a little testy,
Suppose the Jury restive—what consequence might flow !
Oh, #. deceive me, please don't go and leave me,
How can you go and treat a poor Junior so 2 ''
Thus sang a poor Junior, his sorrows a-bewailing,
Thus sang a poor Junior all in the second row:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Selah Harrison (MACMILLAN & §: by Mr. MACNAUGHTAN, is a
remarkable book. It is an admirably and simply, told story of a
religious hero, a Scotchman (as his nationality ought to be, seeing
it is written by one MAc and published by another—“The two
Macs”), a self-sacrificing episcopalian clergyman, who in England
first devotes himself to the service of heathenist hop-pickers, and
then conquering his amatory passion for the young lady with whom
he has fallen desperately in love, he risks his life in order to convert
the savages on a cannibal island. But for his loye for one woman
and his marriage with another he might have been a kind of St.
FRANCIs XAv1ER. The story is so convincingly written as to seem
less a romance than a narrative of actual facts. -
Considering that Mr. HARRY QUILTER, “Barrister-at-law,” is, as
far as concerns black-and-white art, only an amateur, it is wonder-
ful what an amount of careful, painstaking work he has been able
to achieve in his ornamental edition of Robert BRowNING's Pied
Piper, written in black letter by “ MARY his wife,” and printed and
published apparently by Himself, HARRY QUILTER; for as far as the
eagle eye of the Baron can see, there is no sign of any printer's or
publisher's name and address appearing on the first or last F. of
the edition de lure. For the Baron to criticise such a book *ś
rofessional art stand-point would be of course ungenerous.
#. it therefore to say that some of the decorative borders, es-
pecially the one where the rats, frogs, and bats are inter-worked,
are remarkable both for design and execution. The “Barrister-at-
law” must have had a vast amount of spare time on his hands,
when he is able to devote days, may months, or even years, to such
laborious work. The professional “Barrister-at-law” proves him-
self an amateur Draughtsman. -
There is just issued from the Qxford Press, and my Baronite
suspects that no other agency could adequately perform the deli-
cate work, a reproduction of certain famous º: in the
University Galleries at Oxford and in the British Museum. They
comprise “Ars Moriendi,” the work of “the Master E. S.” The
initials E. S. appear on engravings of a date as early as 1466.
All that is left of the craftsman are his work and his initials, to
which last followers in the field reverentiallyº “Master.” It is
surmised that he was a working goldsmith. What is certain is
that he was the first artist of note in the history, of engraving.

'Tis true, in my achievement's early prime
I did imbibe a boisterous delight
To brush the maiden bloom of innocent

Qr print in blood my private autograph
Upon the brazen cheek of oldish brides,
Mothers of families, who might have known
Better, but fell before my martial charms,
And left me, like to Gascony's cadets,
With much to answer for in married homes
Reduced to discord. 'Tis a fatal gift;
Whereof Itaste the penance, being bored.

And all recorded feats in this department

What time I sank the blasted Merrimac—

You lost your barge, and left a thoroughfare

'Twere well to count these kisses for a sign
Of solace.
H-bs-n. Sir, 'tis not the bald result,
The vulgar issue, sport of circumstance,
It is the noble aim exalts a man.
And mine, I briefly reckon—my attempt,
Right there around in Santiaggo Bay,
Has made the merits of the Saxon race

A devil of a distance, there and back.
I tell you, Sir, they have two golden rules
Good for an officer and gentleman—
For so a fine old custom links the names—
To do a brave thing lightly, and forget
Straightway, the deed being done, how brave
it was.

DEAR SIR,-Like many other parents, I
am agitated by the problem, “What are
we to do with our sons?” I have four of
my own, and although the eldest is only
eleven, I feel that one can't begin too soon
to consider the question of their future
careers. The other day I chanced upon an
article in an educational magazine, written
by that eminent novelist, Mr. H. G. WELLs,
which seemed to shed new light upon the
matter. This, according to #. author of
the War of the Worlds, is the best course to
adopt: Study the tastes of your boys when
young; find out what career they then fancy
most, by noticing what rôle they prefer to
fill in their games. Their real bent, their
natural aptitude thus can be discovered, and
so, when the time comes, you can place
them in the various professions which they
chose for themselves years before.
I have carefully carried out this plan, with
the following results:
HARold, aged eleven, wishes to command
a pirate schooner. This profession involves,

no examinations have to be passed in order
to qualify for it, and the income, though a
little uncertain, is not to be despised—
amounting to several shiploads of doubloons

pirates not seldom came to a sudden and
premature end. “Those were rotters,”

profession is as good as settled. I under-
stand that already he has drawn up a list of
his crew, which is to include two friends of
HARoºd's own age, our curate, the gardener's
boy, the local linendraper (who is to con-
tribute the black flag by way of §.
and the cook—“'cos she makes such stunnin'
hardbake.”
Dick, º nine, has nearly decided to
be a Salvation Army preacher—“like
EDITH's brother.” (EDITH, I may explain,
is our housemaid, and her brother, attired
in uniform, is sometimes a visitor in our
kitchen.) Dick is already training for this
calling; yesterday I found him yigorously
haranguing an impassive row of his sister's
dolls. But he hasn't

he has been doing with#. energy for the
last half-hour or so. e informs me that
he is DICK WHITTINGToN listening to the
chimes, and that he means to be Lord
Mayor. I have tried to convince him that
this by itself is hardly, a sufficient pro-
fession. “I 'm not going to be a I.
fession,” he replies, “I’m going to be Lord
Mayor,” and his solo on the dinner-bell
recommences.
WALTER, aged six, announces his unalter-
able resolve of being a dustnan. No reason
for his choice is forthcoming; he only re-
peats it over and over again with increased
conviction. “I won't be a soldier,” he cries,
indignantly, in reply to a timid suggestion of
mine. “Soldiers is silly. I'm going to be
a dustman.”
So, Sir, if I act upon Mr. WELLs' advice,
this difficulty, is at an end, and each of my
sons is provided with a profession for his
later years. But then a further point re:
mains, about which Mr. WELLs is silent, and
so I turn to you for guidance.
How and where am I to have my children
educated, bearing in mind their subsequent
careers?" Can you give me the addresses
of any training colleges for Pirate *ś.
Salvation Army Preachers, Cannibal Chiefs,
Lord Mayors, or Dustmen?
Hoping that you will be able to assist me,

A BALLADE OF INCURABLE
MALADY.
[An article in the Lancet asking, “What is it to
grow old *" declares that it is “arterio-sclerosis
causing involution of the central neuron.”]
THE maidens pass me—and I sigh
To see my poor attractions wane;
Boys that I knew scarce two feet high
ook down upon me with disdain;
And soured in temper, cross of grain,
I ask the doctors' diagnosis;
Thus they my malady explain–
It is arterio-sclerosis.
When stiffening joint and hazy eye
From sport compel me to refrain,
Of prowess in the days gone by
While still inordinately vain;
When sneering friends I entertain
With talk that daily more verbose is—
This is your work in limb and brain,
Alas! arterio-sclerosis.
I seek (but vainly 1), far and nigh,
Cure for my ailment to obtain;
Myself each pleasure I deny,
rom every dainty I abstain–
Do all the doctors may ordain,
Try plasters, lotions, pills, and doses,
rom which all ills relief can gain–
Except arterio-sclerosis.
ENvoy.
Ah, PUNCH ! you still your youth retain—
Pray tell by what metempsychosis
We may, like you, escape this bane—
The dread arterio-sclerosis.

suicide, you were. Just because you’ve been tried for man-
slaughter. That's poison, that is—(pointing to fragments of glass)
—and you were going to drink it.
Therme. Poison, you fool! It was whisky, whisky and water.

HALF-A-DOZEN “LEAGUES." UNDER THE SEA.
(Being the sequel to M. Jules Kºš famous story by a subsequent
hand.
CAPTAIN NEMO paced the cabin of the Nautilus in moody silence.
Readers of JULES WERNE will remember that Captain NEMO was
usually moody and not infrequently silent. Nor was such silence
unbefitting a man of his responsibilities. As commander of the
submarine vessel which (at the suggestion of the Matin newspaper)
had been presented to France by the half-dozen Leagues of Patriots
among whom Paris is at present divided, he had a truly responsible
post. A proud smile, however, softened the stern lines of his lips
as the Nautilus sped swiftly along the surface of the English
Channel on her mission of destruction. “Revanche,” he muttered,
as he sighted Plymouth, and the crew of the Nautilus fell into each
other's arms at the word.
But who was Captain NEMo? No one knew. That dark secret
lay hidden in the dark soul of this inscrutable man. Some said
that in happier days he had proudly borne the name of EstERHAzY.
Some hinted at DU PATY DE CLAM. But none ever ventured to
question the mysterious unknown.
Suddenly two mighty battleships hove in sight on the weather
bow, from which quarter a sound of firing had for some time been
audible. They were steaming rapidly towards the Nautilus, and
appeared to be pounding one another with considerable energy.
aptain NEMO strode to the speaking-tube and shouted an order.
There was a sound of battening down hatches, and slowly the
submarine vessel began to sink. Summoning the crew into the
cabin, Captain NEMo addressed them in a few well-chosen words.
He bade them remember the great nation to which they belonged
and the greatness of the blow they were about to strike. Intense
excitement prevailed on board.
Presently through the green water a huge form loomed above
their heads. With his own hand Captain NEMo discharged a
torpedo at her. The dull sound of an explosion reached their ears.
Then silence. “C'est fini,” cried the Captain; “ Vive la France 1"
Slowly the Nautilus rose to the surface. The hatches were
opened and Captain NEMO mounted on to the platform. Within a
dozen yards of them was—the enemy's i. !
“Mon Dieu !” cried the Captain, “we have sunk the wrong one!”
“Nous sommes trahis 1” cried the crew. “A bas la navigation
sous-marine ! A bas NEMo!” -
Captain NEMo turned on them like a lion. “Imbéciles 1" he
screamed. “Qu'est-ce que vous voulez & C'est un malheur, sans
doute. Mais—”
At this moment a shell from the surviving battleship struck the
Nautilus, which began to fill rapidly. -
- - - -
This was the last of the Nautilus, which sank in three minutes.
If it be the object of a submarine vessel to remain under water for
as long a time as possible, she must be considered a striking
success. For she has never risen since.

THE º; extract is from the Daily News report of proceed-
ings in the Dublin Corporation:—
Mr. Lenihan. If they knocked at WILLIAM REDMonp's clothes, they
would get at some of the militiaman inside. (Laughter and cheers.)
Mr. REDMoND said, he wore no coat that was not worn by CHARLEs
Stewart PARNELL in his early days-(cheers)—by John Boy LE O'REILLY,
or by Lord Edward FitzGERALD. (Applause and a Voice: “They would
not fit ToM LENIHAN.”)

THE EARTH'S NEW SHAPE FOR '99.
[According to Dr. J. W. GREGoRY's lecture at the Royal Geographical
Society, this planet is not an oblate spheroid, but flattened at the Equator as
well as at the Poles, with minor distortions elsewhere. It is, in fact, more
like a º or a peg-top than the orange to which we have always been told
it should be compared.]
THE poor old Earth's knocked out of shape
By modish Dr. GREGoRY,
For, measured with his tailor's-tape,
She's a peg-top or an egg awry.
A common or oblate spheroid
At school we called our planet;
A potato must be now employed
or figure, when you span it.
The Equator's flattened like the Poles,
When round the Line a don tours,
And Fashion Mother Earth controls
Like ladies' sleeves and contours.
HALF-A-DOZEN “LEAGUES." UNDER THE SEA.
(Being the sequel to M. Jules Verne's famous story by a subsequent
hand.)
CAPTAIN NEMO paced the cabin of the Nautilus in moody silence.
Readers of JULES WERNE will remember that Captain NEMO was
usually moody and not infrequently silent. Nor was such silence
unbefitting a man of his responsibilities. As commander of the
submarine vessel which (at the suggestion of the Matin newspaper)
had been F.F. to France by the half-dozen Leagues of Patriots
among whom Paris is at present divided, he had a truly responsible
post. A proud smile, however, softened the stern lines of his lips
as the Nautilus sped swiftly along the surface of the English
Channel on her mission of destruction. “Revanche,” he muttered,
as he sighted Plymouth, and the crew of the Nautilus fell into each
other's arms at the word.
But who was Captain NEMo? No one knew. That dark secret
lay hidden in the dark soul of this inscrutable man. Some said
that in happier days he had proudly borne the name of EstERHAzY.
Some hinted at DU PATY DE CLAM. But none ever ventured to
question the mysterious unknown.
Suddenly two mighty battleships hove in sight on the weather
bow, from which quarter a sound of firing had for some time been
audible. They were steaming rapidly towards the Nautilus, and
º to be pounding one another with considerable energy.
aptain NEMO strode to the speaking-tube and shouted an order.
There was a sound of battening down hatches, and slowly the
submarine vessel began to sink. Summoning the crew into the
cabin, Captain NEMo addressed them in a few well-chosen words.
He bade them remember the great nation to which they belonged
and the greatness of the blow they were about to strike. Intense
excitement prevailed on board.
Presently through the green water a huge form loomed above
their heads. With his own hand Captain NEMo discharged a
torpedo at her. The dull sound of an explosion reached their ears.
Then silence. “C'est fini,” cried the Captain; “ Vive la France 1"
Slowly the Nautilus rose to the surface. The hatches were
opened and Captain NEMO mounted on to the platform. Within a
dozen yards of them was—the enemy's i. !
“Mon Dieu !” cried the Captain, “we have sunk the wrong one!”
“Nous sommes trahis 1” cried the crew. “A bas la navigation
sous-marine ! A bas NEMo!” -
Captain NEMo turned on them like a lion. “Imbéciles 1" he
screamed. “Qu'est-ce que vous voulez & C'est un malheur, sans
doute. Mais—”
At this moment a shell from the surviving battleship struck the
Nautilus, which began to fill rapidly.
- - - - -
This was the last of the Nautilus, which sank in three minutes.
If it be the object of a submarine vessel to remain under water for
as long a time as possible, she must be considered a striking
success. For she has never risen since.

Strophe of Country Birds.
WHITHER, whither can we fly?
Sea- , rook, and raven,
Throstle, mavis, lapwing shy,
Lark that carols in the sky,
Thus in chorus do we cry,
“Where to find a haven?”
Shady woods and valleys fair
In the noonday dreaming,
Dobut hide the gin and snare,
And the sportsman ambushed there—
See his barrel gleaming!
Death is lurking in the lea,
On the moor, and by the sea;
Everythicket, every tree
Is with danger teeming.
There is left no field nor fen,
Where of old we nested,
Where a cock may court a hen
Safe and unmolested.
In the country-side we die,
Harried hither, thither—
Whither therefore can we fly?
Whither? Whither 2 Whither?
Antistrophe of Town Birds.

That the fowler knows not;
Sunny lawns and sheltered shades,

SIR,-Lady WIMBorne, who, if she were
not a GUEST, would be quite a host in her-
self, has been electrifying the readers of the
Times, and of other papers quoting there-
from, with a tale of a donkey in church,
present at some service and taking an active
part in it. Her Ladyship did not describe
the donkey. But why this excitement about
her assertion? Assuredly there should be
none. Why, Sir, I have been in courts of
law, in camps, in cathedrals, in lecture-
rooms of scientific institutions and of
universities, and never can I remember the
F. of donkeys as astonishing anybody.
n fact, Sir, I think the singular fact of onl
one donkey being present might have cause
fact; as, indeed, Lady WIMBoENE has done.
It dawns upon me now that her Ladyship
was astonished, or her informant was asto-
nished, at the presence of only one donkey at
the religious function described. Why, Sir,
I have been in the midst of densely crowded
political gatherings, and not only have I
seen a donkey present (there were no mirrors,
Sir), but have witnessed the repetition of the
Balaamitish miracle! Still I survive, and
am yours and Lady W.'s very sincerely,

SIR,-If but of course I don't who could if he had not the acumen
of a microscope which I never pretended to I understand Mr.
HARRIson aright he is prepared when they have brought it off
(from where I wonder) to take “only such steps as may be advis-
able under the circumstances.”
Now I want to make my contention as clear as (no doubt they
will be sorry when they see what I mean but those people are a
judea, damnatur lot so the nocens by which I want to indicate their
# clergyman naturally always gets off and then removes it to a
ifferent court) possible even to Mr. HARRIsox's limited intelligence
and before I go any further I propose to pose him with an illustra-
tion of these sort of things wº. won't get out of unless which
is absurd and that's where it always must fail they take a new
position as he did when I told them they were a parcel of
mendacious rascals or even worse 5. better) according to which
light you look at it so that it generally comes to the same thing or
more so which is what I said from the beginning.
I remember about twenty-five years ago when the same kind of
rows were (or was) going on over the country and I myself
wrote some pamphlets which I shall explain later on meeting the
late Archbishop TAIT in the summer of 1880 at a garden party given
by the Baroness BURDETT-Coutts and I then asked }. oint-
blank which was as if I had said in other words how many beans
make five what he wanted me to do if such scoundrels still went
on doing what they had declared they would do but had not yet
done in about six months' time at the most, that being the period
laid down in Lord PENZANCE's admirable judgment, if ever there
was one, on a totally different question but arising as they knew
perfectly, well out of the same dispute; and the Ajº. at that
time said nothing though what he might have said later if he had
that was that I ought to denounce it publicly urbi et orbi which is
what I intend doing as long as I have breath in my body or a pen
to write it with.
But suppose I meet a rector of a parish . the deliberate
judgment of the Court of Arches on a roan-coloured mare in the
first week of November when they are drawing it for the first time
and a fox am I to sit quietly by and merely gallop up to him with
a whole set of interrogatories neatly arranged by the Bishop's
chaplain for use on special occasions?. Of course I am not in the
position of a regular follower that being by statute (de ...'.
3 & 4 Jac. I., cap. 17, where we are forbidden to use “coulters or
Fº save and except in the manner prescribed by His
Majesty's most honourable, Privy Council for that purpose law-
fully assembled and not otherwise"—does Mr. HARRIson who is
naturally much more of a purblind fool than I think him though
after this I shall think him more so than what he was when I
began to think him so want any more, if he does I can give
chapter and verse for it?) but I have the same rights (jura equestria
which about settles it for him) as any layman attending in the
exercise of his rational daily exercise at the covert-side.
That being so what in the name of common sense is the use of
Mr. HARRIsoN asking me who said rats? If I said but I refuse to
pledge myself about it rats I am ready to stick to it or to the sinking
ship as it soon will be if Mr. HARRIsoN and his fellow-buffoons
have their way which rats never, yet have or will do as to which I
am not going to give any opinion at all in the way of a final
judgment except to declare my own, fixed and settled conviction
that this method is the most pernicious nonsense and that is as
ou must agree a fairly moderate assertion after all the cant and
ypocrisy to which these episcopal and other HARRIsons, have
though I don't deny that they are not honest or fools if that is
what they are driving at accustomed us.
Yours obediently, GR-MTH-RPE.
P.S.—Next week I will smash Mr. HARRIson for good though up

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 65
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE author of Elizabeth and her German Garden discreetly pre-
serves her anonymity. But the secret must have been pierced by
some of the acquaintances and guests of her German home. One
safeguard in the pleasing exercise of a woman's right to say what
she likes of a sister is that the model for the free-handed drawing
will be the last to recognise the fidelity of the portrait. Accepting
that theory, we are left to full enjoyment of the scathing sketches
of Irais, the young German matrón, who, having been invited to
pay a visit, showed no tendency towards homeward movement, and
of Minora, the English girl of literary tendencies with her project
of a book. “Just my impressions, you know, of your country.
Anything that strikes me as curious or amusing I jot it down, and
when I have time shall work it up into something, Idaresay.” . The
#. conversation of the º and the exceedingly clever
indications of character are set in the framework of the much-
beloved garden and of a country bounded on one side by the Baltic:
“The sudden view of the sea from the mossy, pine-coloured
height; the wonderful stretch of lonely shore, with the forest to
the water's edge; the coloured sails in the blue distance; the
freshness, the brightness, the vastness,” compose a scene marred
& mosquitoes. Everything has its compensating advantage.
hen visitors have stayed too long, the hospitable Elizabeth, one
fine, hot morning, proposes a picnic, to the Baltic. The un-
suspecting visitors joyfully assent. They have a day with the
mosquitoes, and on getting back they think they will return to
their own homes. These visitors are, of course, all women.
My Baronite is not sure which, passion is the stronger with
the gentle Elizabeth, her love of flowers or her antipathy to
her own sex. She sedulously cultivates the assumption that she
herself is of German race. But no German is gifted with the par-
ticular kind of humour that sparkles over these pages, nor could
any write such excellent English. In only one sentence do Ger-
man associations corrupt good English, hen Elizabeth writes,
“I have been reading a Life of Luther, lent me by our Parson in
the intervals between looking round me and being happy,” she
does not mean exactly what she says. The Parson did not walk
round her, beaming with joy, pausing at intervals to lend her
LUTHER. All she means is that she had been reading the book in
restful moments of a busy, happy day.
“The Eyes have it !” Any one doubting the power of eyes has
only to turn for ocular demonstration to the creepy-crawley, diaboli-
cal vampirey mystery, entitled “Maquita,” which is the first of four
strangely weird stories to be found in Some Fantasies of Fate (DIGBY,
Long & Co.), by M. W. WELBoRE, who the Baron, perpetrating a
mediaeval conceit on the author's name, hopes will “bore” for more
springs in that “well ” which is the source of his present ..}.
nor should he leave Well alone, the Baron being quite sure that,
having done so well, he had better stick to it, unless he can “go
one or two better.” But why leave us, not dissatisfied, but
unsatisfied, and asking for a satisfactory finish to every story?
Of this present collection, the Baron strongly advises all who will
listen to his words of wisdom to ignore the author's arrangement
of his own stories, and to place the second one, “Rejected of Men,”
; as its simple pathos will quiet the nerves after supping full of
orrors.
Blackwood, always worth half-a-crown, both in respect of
quantity and quality, comes out this month, not a modest magazine,
but a portly volume. This present February marks the 1,000th
number of Maga, and “the House" celebrate the event b
scattering the largesse of a double number. It is full of º
things of diverse interest., My Baronite turns with keen interest
to Sir John Mowbray's chat about his “Seventy Years at West-
minster.” The Father of the House of Commons is the only man
living who could discourse on this particular theme. His
reminiscences are charming, and the charm would be increased if
he would only let himself go, chatting more about his personal
experiences and acquaintances than of epochs of parliamentary
history, record of which is accessible in books. Those who have
rivate acquaintance with the benignant Father of the House of
!ommons know it is constitutional modesty that restrains his
pen. It is difficult to convince him that matters pertaining strictly
to himself can interest the busy world at the ...”of the nineteent
century. That is a mistake he will have full opportunity to correct
in future instalments, for of his three-score years and ten he has
re-paced only one half the track. THE BARON DE B.-W.
“Who Is THE ENGLISH AUTHoRITY on' GRAMMAR 2' heads a
letter from “H. A. T.,” who quotes a sentence from some corre-
spondence in “a contemporary.” Mr. Punch caps “H. A.T.” by
requoting the words of a certain well-known theatre-goer, now, alas,
no longer among us, who uttered this immortal sentence, “Me and
him has took stalls.” This, for grammar, has never been beaten.

horses, thereby causing danger to life and limb. But while the
L.C.C. is able to see this trouble without spectacles, let it put 'em on
and do something (if it is within its powers) first and foremost for
the general ill-lighting of most London streets, which are still, in
comparative darkness, or rather, darkness made visible by the feeble
glimmering of weak lamps at rare intervals. In some not unfashion-
able quarters, down S.W. way, after the shops, whence comes the
strongest light, are closed, and after the fan-lights of private hºuses
are extinguished, it is difficult for the most sober teetotaler, with the
full use of his eyes, to see his way twenty yards ahead except on the
clearest night. S.W. lighting is only “better than nothing at all.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Sultry and far; but not so far nor sultry,
No, nothing like it, as a certain place,
Not the Unmentionable, but another,
That isle, “the loneliest in a lonely sea,”
Where ENoch ARDEN stayed; and he came
back,
And very nearly spoilt a happy homel
Such doubts they }.
But when Sir Port E-DRAPEAU
Had eased their hearts with goodly meats
and drinks
Fizzing, that make the face of man to shine
With inward rapture, and the liberal mind
Mellows to acquiescence—then the doubts
Vanished that vexed erewhile the empty
maw,
Or were reduced by ninety-five per cent. ;
While all the roseate dreams they ever had,
Wherein the tide of war had seemed to turn,
And, turning, throw the heathen upside
down
And generally break them, these same
dreams,
Viewed through an ample after-dinner glow,
Were seen as §§. curiously º:
But what was said by him, Sir Port E-
DRAPEAU,
Or never said aloud, but thought the more,
There at the banquet—he that tells the tale,
Says he will give in what he calls his next.
But I, that know him well, know well he
won't.

Why I am sad and dreary,
Why I seemed overwhelmed by woe,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Sultry and far; but not so far nor sultry,
No, nothing like it, as a certain place,
Not the Unmentionable, but another,
That isle, “the loneliest in a lonely sea,”
Where ENoch ARDEN stayed; and he came
back
And very nearly spoilt a happy homel
Such doubts they }.
But when Sir Port E-DRAPEAU
Had eased their hearts with goodly meats
and drinks
Fizzing, that make the face of man to shine
With inward rapture, and the liberal mind
Mellows to acquiescence—then the doubts
Vanished that vexed erewhile the empty
maw,
Or were reduced by ninety-five per cent. ;
While all the roseate dreams they ever had,
Wherein the tide of war had seemed to turn,
And, turning, throw the heathen upside
down
And generally break them, these same
dreams,
Viewed through an ample after-dinner glow,
Were seen as double, curiously enough.
But what was said by him, Sir PortE-
DRAPEAU,
Or never said aloud, but thought the more,
There at the banquet—he that tells the tale,
Says he will give in what he calls his next.
But I, that know him well, know well he
won't.
TO A HARD-HEARTED EDITOR.
SUPPosiNg you should wish to know
Why I am sad and dreary,
Why I seemed overwhelmed by woe,
And why I look so weary;
The best of reasons I could state
For being thus affected,
My contributions have of late
So often been rejected.
(Soft Reply from H. H. Editor.)
But now, my friend, you'll joyous be,
Chirp, smile, and bé ivº !
Because, for once, as you may see,
Your lines are here inserted.

memorable piece, been better suited, and the perplexity, jealousy,
misery, corporal and mental, of Montague Mendle are greeted with
shouts of irrepressible laughter by a cruelly unsympathetic and
hilarious audience. The more wretched he becomes the greater
the delight of his “friends in front.” And the Mr. Jonas Todden-

cranium ! Immense! His eccentricities of speech remind me of
a certain lady in the Happy Thought series. I fancy she was

there's life in a joke, there's hope. To see the silly old dodderer is
a perpetual smile, to hear him is a laugh directly he opens his mouth.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extract ED PRoM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, February 7.-
Parliament met to-day for a new Session.
Hope it will prove a little livelier than the
last. Only those who lived through it (some
have since died) know how dull it was. It
is the unexpected that happens, somebody
has said. It didn't with us in the Commons
last year. The malevolent monotony of a
massive majority lay over House as a wet
blanket. Impossible even for the liveliest
nature to wriggle under its dank folds.
Potentiality of wholesome irruptions in the
incident of the new gathering. When Par-
liament prorogued, the SQUIRE of MALwood
was Leader of the Opposition. To-day he sits
apart; has voluntarily resumed the dignity
of a private Member. Couldn't stand the
fº on of unnamed turbulent spirits in a
arty whose ancient watchword was “Peace,
Retrenchment, and Reform.” The waving
of flags, the beating of drums, the blowing of
trumpets, and the clashing of arms he could
not away with. So he resigned his com-
mission, and will serve in the ranks.
The Member for Sark, who holds that the
poet is also prophet, will have it that
SPENSER foresaw the scene in the House
to-day when in “The Teares of the Muses,”
he thus discoursed:
But to some gentle spirit, from whose tongue
Large streames of honnie and sweete nectar flowe,
Scorning the boldness of such base-borne men
Which their follies forth so rashlie throwe,
Doth rather choose to sit in idle cell
Than so himselfe to mockerie to sell.
“Pen” SPENSER wrote as the last word of
the first line. But SARK isn't thinking of
the SQUIRE's recess letters to the Times on
Ritualism in the Church. -
The marvel to me is that the SQUIRE, not
chiefly famous for long-suffering equability
of temper, should so long have remained at
a th ess post. He began his political
career by sacrificing an assured position at
the Parliamentary Bar guerdoned with
more than Ministerial salary. He closed it
by gallant endeavour to keep together the
querulous remnant of a routed Party. A
grizzled captain finds joy in fighting against
whatsoever odds, if his own following be
compact and disciplined. With mutiny
threatened, lukewarmness at best, the
stoutest heart, must grow sick, and long to
be quit of the whi. business. So the
SQUIRE of MALwood has vacated the cush-
ioned but thorn-pierced seat of the Leader,
and will carry his musket in the ranks.
It is on the chance of its occasionally
§. off at unexpected moments in unusual
irections that SARK bases his expectation
of the coming Session being salted with
something more of human interest than
was the last.
Meanwhile PRINCE ARTHUR has laid aside
his widow's weeds and smiles across the
table at the bridegroom en second moces. “I
am," he said, speaking at Edinburgh when
the joyousness of Christmas was on its very
eve marred by announcement of the SQUIRE

And did thoughtfully assign,
As a feast, the day he died on
To the good St. Valentine.
'Twas the day birds choose formating,
And in loving pairs combine;
Followed suit the youths and maidens,
Called each other “Valentine.”
Oh, the gladness l Oh, the gladness Oh,

DINING OUT.
At the close of an º and interest-
ing article de lure in the Pall Mall Gazette,
some ten days ago, on Dinners and Diners,
hymning the praises of the eminent M.
Joseph, now of the Savoy Hotel and Restau-
rant, the items and prices of a plain and
simple diner d deuz were given. There were
only five dishes, with champagne, coffee,
liqueurs, and the bill amounted to £2 17s. ;
let us add tips to waiters, &c., and say,
nobly, three pounds. Deduct 18s. for cham-
pagne, and the dinner for two cost two
guineas.

at, say,
moderate doctum,” i.e., “slightly doctored”),
eight shillings the bottle; then the dinner,
with attendance, would be £2 10s. for two
persons. Seven dinners a week for, one
person would be £8 15s. What an induce-
ment for any one with limited means !
After this, it will not be astonishing to
learn that there are many, nay, that there
is a majority of genuine epicures who, not
having the requisite eight pounds, fifteen
per week, “know not Joseph,” and, what
is more, don't want to, at the price. If the
invaluable Josephus can do them º
well at half the sum, then — but that 's
another story.
Not a few gourmets can mention one
Restauration or more, not as yet, thank
oodness, so widely known by name as the
Savoy, where, for half, or even for less than
half the price above-mentioned, can be ob-
tained an equally good and quite as recherché
a dinner. Those who “know” may safely
back London against Paris for a thoroughly
artistic, and a perfectly reasonable dinner.
In fact, as a rule, directly a place is written
about and lauded up to #. skies, it sustains
its reputation for a while, and then, the pro-
bability is that it is spoiled by its own
success.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN producing a #. of William Shakspeare (SMITH, ELDER), Mr.
SIDNEY LEE took in hand an alluring theme, and has, my Baronite
tells me, produced a fascinating j. It is commonly conceded
that the personality of SHAksPEARE, who lived in pre-biographical
days, remains the least familiar among great men save HoMER.
that is known, or can be known, is here set forth with
consummate skill and admirable lucidity. The amount of eru-
dition displayed, happily unobtrusively, is amazing. Mr. LEE
seems to have read everything that has º written or conjectured
about SHAKSPEARE. Out of the moving, often vaporous, mass
he has evolved a figure of flesh and blood, who worked hard,
boldly delyed amongst other peoples' stores, illumined this pillage
with the light of supreme genius, achieved a most respectable
fortune, bought houses and land, and when he died, left his wife
his second-best bed, and took care that she should not be buried
in the same grave with him. . The difficulty, hitherto provin
insurmountable, of writing such a book, enhances the credit o
its achievement.
With The Middle Classes (Le Petit Bourgeois), J. M. DENT
& Co. have just completed their issue of BALzAc translated and
unbowdlerised. As far as the Baron has been able to examine
the series, the English adaptation has been very well done, and to
those whom Providence has not blessed (or otherwise) with perfect
knowledge of the French language, these volumes will prove a valu-
able acquisition. To the Baron, a little of BALzAc at a time is
dº. refreshing; but a course of him would be tedious.
The Baron, ever delighting in romance and mystery, is glad to
recommend, and strongly too, a book by Mr. WILLIAM §: UEUx,
entitled The Day of Temptation (F. W. WHITE & Co.). Mr. LE
UEUx possesses the art of at once awaking and then sustaining
the reader's Qu-eux-riosity. At the close of every chapter, except
the final one, the interested peruser exclaims with the melodra-
matic receiver of confidences, “Proceed! Sweet Warbler! Your
story interests me much l " Do we know Bruciani's Restaurant
in Regent Street? Not yet; but if there be a Bruciani's, then
WILLIAM LE QU-onqueror should never want for a meal or a bottle
of rare Italian wine as long as Bruciani's shallexist. How well, how
awfully well must WILLIAM Lº Q. (avery sharp-pointed Q.)know this
“The life of a man or woman can always be taken for a sovereign in
London, if only one knows where to look for men ready to accomplish such
work.”
There's a sovereign ready for dispatching an obnoxious personſ
The Baron trembles. Forty enemies of his at sixpence a piece can
procure the services of a quiet assassin, and no questions asked
“JAMEs' " cries the hº Baron to his faithful attendant, “bring
me my shirt of chain mail to wear over my merino vest, see that
my umbrella-handle-revolver is loaded, give me my electric-current
loves, also my sword-stick, and I will go out for an hour's exercise,
through Piccadilly, Regent Street, Waterloo Place, the Strand, the
Embankment, and back again But first—to Scotland Yardl or
to call on Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEUx!
The Baron can, and hereby does, strongly recommend The
Paths of the Prudent, by J. S. FLETCHER (METHUEN). It is an
excellently well-told story of a very pretty and attractive orphan
girl, discreetly educated by a worldly-wise elderly lady. Dorinthia's
“face is her fortune, Sir, she said,” and she searches for the very best
investment of her capital. . Her most amorous impulses are kept
in check by the calmest calculation. She has a warm heart, but a
remarkably cool head, and her virtue earns its reward, for there is,
as it were, an uncommonly knowing little cherub sitting up aloft to
keep watch and ward over the liaisons of the prudent, but far from
ji. maiden. The simple style in which the story is narrated,
and the characters and their doings described, is genuinely humor-
ous, while the reader's interest in the prudent pilgrim's #. is
§ sustained to the very end; and an uncommonly natural
nish it is, too.
The Baron's assistant has read A Haunted Town by ETHEL F.
HEDDLE (WELLs GARDNER, DARTon AND Co.), and warmly recom-
mends it to those who, being satiated with bloodshed and rapine
and hairbreadth 'scapes by flood and field, may desire to compose
their nerves by reading a direct and simple story charmingly told.
Miss HEDDLE has a flowing and graceful style, and (which is of
greater value in the eyes of the jaded novel-reader) she has humour
and pathos. Aunt #. the unwearying enthusiast in the
cause of Mary, Queen of Scots, is one of the most delightful and
touching creations the Assistant has met with for a long time in
fiction. Miss HEDDLE, it should be added, uses the Scotch dialect
with a discretion that not even the most determined Southron

CoMBAT SANGUINAIRE. ÉMEUTE À LoNDREs.
GRÈVE DEs CoCHERS.
[If our very esteemed contemporary, L'Intransigeant, did not publish the
following last week, it ought to have done so. The only possible explanation
is to be found in the absence of M. HENRI TRoPFoRT.]
ON nous mande de Londres qu'un évènement, absolument inouï
chez ce peuple calme et flegmatique, a eu lieu lundi dernier. La
perfide Albion, amie des Dreyfusards et de tous les traîtres, aura
enfin son Affaire.
Le " Lord Chef Judge,'' président de la Cour de Cassation en
Angleterre, a voulu passer par la porte du Hidparc dans la Rue
Witall. Il paraît que l'entrée est interdite aux juges. Le * Lord
Chef Judge '' conduisait son mail. Un brave soldat-même en
Angleterre les soldats sont braves-essaya de s'opposer à l'ignoble
attentat du juge. Même en Angleterre les juges sont-[Here we
omit seven lines of vituperation]. Le brave soldat saisit les quatre
chevaux, et le mail s'arrêta. Le juge, furibond, s'écria " A bas
l'armée ! '' et se jetta par terre. Le brave soldat l'attendit tran-
uillement. .. Alors une lutte terrible s'engagea. Le juge, homme
'une force énorme, saisit la tête du brave militaire, et, la serrant
sous le bras gauche, la frappa violemment de la main droite. C'est
ce qu'on appelle " to be in Chancery," système de boxe des jº#
anglais. La sentinelle, poussant des cris de " Vive l'armée ! Au
secours !" parvint enfin à se dégager de l'éntreinte judiciaire, en
inçant les mollets du juge. Mais ce dernier, d'un coup de poing,
ança le brave soldat dans la Tamise, et, hurlant à pleins poumons
" A bas l'armée !'' grimpa sur le siége du mail, fouetta ses
chevaux, et entra au galop dans le Hidparc.
C'est pour éviter de pareilles infamies en France que nous nous
opposons aux Dreyfusards, aux Juifs, aux juges. Il faut les pendre,
les massacrer, les écorcher, les brûler. Ah, misérable canaille !
[Here we omit mineteen lines of vituperation.]
La perfide Albion, qui se moque sans cesse de nos efforts patri-
otiques, nous révèle enfin l'arrogance sans bornes de sa magistra-
ture audacieuse. Quel spectacle ! Le "Lord Chef Judge,'' élégant
" smart " de la haute noblesse, conduisant son mail du dernier
chic, arrêté par le simple soldat, luttant jusqu'au dernier moment
contre l'insolence judiciaire, presque no † dans la Tamise,
et jeté ensuite dans le plus lugubre cachot de la Tour de Londres !
Nous recevrons avec grand plaisir les souscriptions de nos lecteurs
pour lui envoyer L'Intransigeant tous les jours. Il supportera
mieux sa vie de martyr en lisant-pourvu qu'il ait appris le
français, bien entendu-les dernières nouvelles de la lutte efi
France entre les juges et l'armée. Vive l'armée ! Et nos abonnés
en Angleterre ne sont pas nombreux.
Mais ce n'est pas encore fini à Londres. On parle d'émeutes
dans plusieurs quartiers de la ville. Une grève des cochers éclata
le soir. On dit que les partisans de l'ancienne famille royale de
STUvART ont arboré leur drapeau sur la statue de CHARLEs I".
Est-ce qu'on peut trouver un QUESNAY DE BEAUREPAIRE à Londres?

HOLIDAYS.
THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE ;
Or, " Don't cry till you're out of the Willow-wood.''
(A Sonnet Sequence after-some distance after-Rossetti.)
I sAT with JoNEs* beside a fireless hearth
Writing unacted dramas, I and he,
We sought for jest and quip and repartee,
And burned more candle than the game was worth.
Dull dogs we were that had but little mirth,
And when " our mirrored eyes met silently,''
I frowned at JoNEs and JoNEs frowned back at me ;
So we two sat and plied our quills in wrath.
Then as it seemed a sudden rapture seized
On JoNEs, and, his resentment half appeased,
He penned and flung to me a † note.
Then (like RossETTI) with a playful groan
He cried, ** For once, for once, for once alone ''
A Poet I!—and this was what he wrote :-
" Oh ye, all ye who write in Drama-land,
ho work with hollow faces † white,
Better, with LANDoR, go to Lama-land,
Better to farthest China wing your flight,
Assyria's wastes or that still warmer land
(From which your chances of return are slight)
Where Satan reads the works of SARAH GRAND,
If your dramatic works ne'er see the light !
* Alas ! the Bitter Banks of Drama-land,
The empty tills, the overdrawn account,
The Attic salt of Fleet Street and the Strand,
The attic stairs up which you daily mount !
Better a broom, a crossing, ANYTHING,
Than Drama-land should hold you wandering ! ''

Chatty Tourist. “BEAUTIFUL specimeN of A Roman CAMP, this, is N'T IT?”

I DECLINE To ADMIT THERE CAN BE ANY TRUE BEAUTY ABOUT ANYTHING Rolſ.AN ? "
AU MIDI.
(Being an authoritative reply to “Morte
#.ſº
How frankly on the open face
These airs caress me, warm and free!
With what a coy, coquettish grace
Woos me the tideless inland seal
I sit and call “Encore unbock 1"
I lap this beverage by the litre :
I long to leap from yonder rock
Into the cool réserve aua huttres.
I view the firmamental vault
Unsullied by a single cloud;
It is of such a rich cobalt
That I could nearly laugh aloud!
Before me in a steady stream
Go youth and beauty, flushed and fain;
And I, Ibanish care and seem
To be a bounding boy again.
Once more I move in guileless mirth,
Light-hearted, curly, eager-faced;
Once more a not unpleasing girth
Distinguishes my supple waist.
My step is light, my chin is one,
y way is flanked with vernal flowers;
M; eye reflects the flashing sun,
freely pluck the ample hours.
Too crude to shape a nation's creed
Too young as yet to grasp the lead
And mould the destinies of men—
I take the pendent fringe of Time,
I suck the sweets that Nature sends,
Before I yield my manhood's prime
For purely altruistic ends.
These are the memories hold me now
Under a heaven azure-fair,
Whose balm (I mentioned) fans my brow
And leaves me strangely débonnaire.
I take my journal up for joy;
I read with measureless content
Of such as find a fond employ
In talking to a Parliament.
I think I see them sitting tight,
Without my wit to work the strings,
Discussing, weary night by night,
The Royal Speech and other things.
And there against the same old foe,
Who is it heads the same old van 2
Dimly his name I seem to know—
A certain CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN.
“Mon Dieu !” I cry, “and can it be
That pride of playing such a rôle
Had ever any charms for me,
Or power to bind my soaring soul?”
“Morte d'Harcourt,” is it? Be it so |
Dead to the hum of yonder hive 1
But otherwise I rather trow
I have my senses all at play;
Keen rapture courses round my skin,
Here where I sit and, so to say,
Just drink the Mediterranean in.
“Ces malheureuz qui se battent lå-bas!”
Knowing the language, I exclaim;
And turn to muse on Mardi Gras
And merry routs of mi-caréme.
A NEW TERROR.
As an addition to the terrible submarine
torpedo-boat which is to work such havoc
with the English Fleet, it is º that
our French neighbours should form a sub-
marine corps, in diving dresses, to operate
against us from the bed of the sea. They
would be armed with gimlets, corkscrews,
and other deadly weapons with which to
make holes in our ships. They could also
throw stones at anybody leaning over the
side. Already the whole of the “floor” of
the English Channel has been taken for a
parade-ground, and for future aggressive
operations. It will be damp, but not
together unhealthy (unless the air, pipes
suddenly fail: then it will—for the divers).
Up to the present, strangely enough, few
have volunteered, either from the Reserve
or elsewhere. In fact, the only Reserve
noticeable is that which suddenly comes

Wielding at large my layman's pen,
over every man who is invited to join.
That I was never more alive!

RIsoN or those sympathisers few I trust who are made after the

them to say it in when they mean merely that they are like him.
It was only close on thirty years ago or somewhere about that

I'm sure it wasn't more or even twenty that the late Dean BURGoN
whom I remember speaking to when he was first asked about it

more than most other spaniels that I have met but the then

made a very remarkable speech on temperance or something

But of course he now sees those are not the kind or sort or cha-
racter of beatings I referred to when he taxed me as if he was an
assessor with meaning it though my words were plain enough to
anybody but the meanest intelfigence. And of course if there is to
be any more beating about the bush it wasn't me who will be or

MR. BRIEFLESS, JUNIOR, AND HIS CANINE CLIENT.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
As the recognised organ of the legal profession, I beg to ask your
advice, or the advice .#. of your forensic readers. I am in a
position of some difficulty. I am proprietor, or part proprietor, of
a small and exceptionally intelligent dog, that I will call, for the
purpose of future identification, my Canine Client. The real name
of my Canine Client is Spot, and I only claim part proprietorship
as I have the questionable advantage of being responsible for the
º of the licence and any damage which may be occasioned
y his want of thought or natural vivacity of spirits... So far, that
vivacity has only led to the mutilation of two pairs of dress-shoes,
three drawing-room rugs, a kitchen-duster, the shinier portion of
my brief-bag, and the total extinction of his own licence: His
society is claimed by my two sons, who attempt to secure it by the
old-fashioned legal custom of trial by battle. On these occasions
SPOT usually joins in the fray, lending his services to the litigant
who seems for the moment to be having the better of the argument.
On a recent occasion my Canine Client, having apparently con-
cealed successfully his collar, muzzle, and tail-rosette, stealthily
left our joint home in Fashoda Gardens (where I have recently
leased a private residence), and sought shelter in a neighbour's
mansion. Here he was discovered seemingly arranging a
menu which no doubt would have contained a salmi of “upper
leathers.” The alarm was immediately given, the police were
sent for, and my luckless Canine Client was transferred to
the reluctant guardianship of a constable. I have been told
that he was conducted to a cell in the nearest station, and
after some negotiation, in which the tendering and acceptance
of a shilling figured, was brought back to my non-professional
abiding-place. During his absence from our home in common
I have been intº was chained up in an unsheltered yard,
bearing indignantly the brunt of the most inclement weather.
| Since then he has lost his spirits, and even when left in solitude
with a pair of patent-leather shoes and an embroidered anti-
|º refuses to eat them. As a sequel to his adventure in
my º bour's house, I was served with a summons to show
cause why I should not be fined for allowing a dog of mine to be
at large unmuzzled, to the danger of the health and comfort of the
Metropolitan public. I need scarcely say that, with a view to
| clearing the reputation of my Canine Client and protecting his
'good name and fame, I spent hours, nay, days, in hunting up
precedents and polishing my eloquence, rather rusty in the
prevailing dearth of forensic practice. Brought face to face with a
magistrate, I was able to convince his Worship that the house
from which my Canine Client had been abducted was not a public
place, and left the Court triumphant in the knowledge that the
case was dismissed and that Spot still retained a blameless
character.
Now, Sir, I would ask you, and those who are as learned in
the law as yourself, what remedy have I, against the police
authorities? Have I a ground of action for false imprisonment,
unlawful possession, or incitement to causing a breach of the
peace? Spot no longer shows his sporting and martial proclivi-
ties by chivying the cat and defending the letter-box from invasion
from the postman's unsuspicious fingers;... As a compensating
advantage the door-mat is in perfect condition and my slippers
are at rest. (Signed) A. BRIEFLEss, JUNIoR.
Pump Handle Court, February 11.
P.S.—Since writing the above I have had reassuring news
relative to the health of my Canine Client. I have }: been told
that Spot has made an excellent meal off the leather facings to my
É. book-case and a couple of cloth-bound volumes of the Granta.
rom this, I take it that he is convalescent, and can scarcely
sustain a claim for damages.

ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, 4. February 7.
— Curious to note marked, unexpected
effect CAwMELL-BANNERMAN wrought upon

the sensitive framework of PRINCE ARTHUR.
If there is any man who in general appear-
ance and manner is calculated to place an
individual or a company at its ease, it is the

night of the new Session, a prevalent atmo-

ally genial man as Leader of the Opposition,
a perfectly urbane one leading the House,
the Millennium must surely be within
the four-mile radius. -
All right to start with. ... The new Leader
of the Opposition, personally a favourite on
both º loudly cheered by his friends,
beamed upon by his adversaries. CAWMELL
ca'ed canny at the opening of his speech.
Made believe to be in even more parlous
position than the glistening warriors who,
after pathetic appeal for clemency, moved
and seconded the Address. If they might
with reason throw themselves on the
charity of the House, how much more the
novice who now trembled in the roomy
shoes of the errant SQUIRE of MALwooD 2
PRINCE ARTHUR _nodded re-assuringly
across the table. JokIM, sitting next to
him, benevolently smiled. “Nonsense, dear
boy,” he seemed to say, “you ’re doing
pretty well, and will be all right if you keep
your pecker up. Don't be afraid of Us.”
Soon the scene changed. First with sur-
rise, then with consternation, finally, in
º anger, PRINCE ARTHUR and his
companions found that the benevolent-
visaged gentleman standing at the table
opposite was pitching into their policy, was
saying unflattering things about Fashoda,
was critical about Crete, was wanting to
know about the Far East, was not quite
certain about the Soudan, and, nastiest cut
of all, was dragging into light an old election
amphlet dating back to time when DoN
osłº had written up “Old Age Pensions”
on the Party wall and concealed intention

This disappointing; not the sort of thing

it was downright rude.
ARTHUR so acutely that he, usually at
his best when in a tight place, halted and
stumbled, pausing for the right word, losing
his way through a thicket of wrong ones.
Will doubtless get over it by and bye. It's
the surprise that shocks. As R. G. WebstER

Why should the “Rule of the Road” be
“at sea”?. Nothing is more simple: Keep
always on the left; pass a vehicle, which is
going in same direction as yourself, on the
right. Where's the difficulty 2 . Is there
any mistake in the spelling? Ought it to be
“The Rule of the Rowed at Sea?” But,
in that case, the passive “rowed" might be
the steerer. Evidently some error some-
where; but, of course, not on the part of

suggestion about CHARLIE BEREsford going

with avidity. “I saw it stated in some

commercial traveller.”
“Much as it may surprise the right hon.

noble lord is exactly what he thought it
impossible he could be—namely, a commer-
cial traveller.”
Whereat, the newspaper reports truly say.
there was “great laughter.” That is natural
enough, for the little jest had its birth in
these humble pages. In Punch of the 20th

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Our useful friend, the

any regulation of tenderness since it was
brought into the public service. Let us take
Regent Street on a day of steady downpour.
ere come a couple of pedestrians, a lady
and gentleman, with one umbrella between
them, naturally upheld by the cavalier.
Pray notice that in his awkward anxiety to
save his hat, the latter permits the drops
from the parapluie to descend free on the
left shoulder of his fair companion, who
enters the café, flinging the wet from her
jacket like a damp retriever, and exclaims,
angrily, “What a beastly umbrella that
is ''' Could any accusation be more un-
fair? The unhappy mixture of silk and
steel has done its §e. to protect both, but
owing to the male pedestrian not havin
been educated up to umbrella-work, couple
with his own selfishness, the unlucky
“brolly” has to bear the blame, as well as
the greater part of the ducking.
Now observe the meeting of that very tall
individual and that very short person, both
umbrella'd. The latter raises his protector
as high as his right arm will reach. Seeing
this, the giant reduces his reach. What is
the consequence 2 A collision, rents in both
umbrellas, and some language not com-

cation.
The rain stops for a while. Down come

pictures. Verestchat’ means “to whimper,”
in Russian, but there is not much whining
about this warrior-artist, as he unflinch-
ingly sets down on canvas, the various ex-
tremely unpleasant conditions of a cam-
paign in an Arctic climate; though he is
this time a little less blood-curdling with
“Napoleon's Retreat from Moscow" than on
the occasion of his former exhibition at the
Grosvenor Gallery. GospodiN IV. V. V.
has compiled a highly interesting and his-
torical booklet (not without touches of con-
siderable naïveté) to accompany his pictures,
but why, oh why, are the latter numbered
out of all order, or sometimes not at all 2
In one instance the same number (65) and
verbal description serves for two quite
different scenes at Inkerman, one showing
the famous Rock, and the other the bridge
over the Chernaya. Perhaps since our visit
this eccentricity may have been corrected.
VERESTCHAGIN gives us personal details
with regard to some of his subjects in the
next room. Servant girls are cheap in
Viatka. For example, No. 38 earns eighteen-
pence a month. “My cook at Moscow
(No. 84) lived some time in St. Petersburg,
and therefore uses German words occasion-
ally.” Here is material for an epitaph, as
also in the case of a zealous Mayor of a
village near Rostov in the Yaroslav Goyern-
ment, who, we are told in a note, '..has
ainted the Church red.” Is this the official
ussian equivalent to our English painting
the town the same cheerful colour?

TOO BAD !
[“For the future Foreign Office letters of intro-

regarded as entitling the holders to hospitality.
An introduction is not an invitation to dinner; so
it is now announced in a circular signed by Lord
SALisbury himself.”—Daily Paper.]
IMPossiblEl too bad! too badl
And after all the ructions
And endless trouble I have had
To get these introductions!
And now—it is enough to try
One's temper, saint or sinner—
To find these letters don't imply
A tea, far less a dinnerl
My darling girls, my angels bright,
My winsome, gay love-darters
I thought to see you every night
Among the stars and garters.
You, JANE, should make a brilliant match,
And KATE, you'd cut a dash, eh?
I counted on you, love, to catch
Some unattached attaché.
But this is all a dream. No more
For us these golden chances;
No more the dear ambassador
Will ask us to his dances:
We shall no longer waltz till dawn
With counts and kings—instead, loves,
We'll have to stay at home and yawn,
Until it's time for bed, loves.

SINCE the announcement of M. DUPUy's

reason to believe that there is more or less
of truth in the following rumours.
Mr. BALFour has bet Sir WILLIAM HAR-
court one new bicycle to one complete set
of the Times that no one ever saw, after
death, the donkey frequently mentioned in
the great church controversy. The loser to
ride the bicycle, or to read all the news-
papers, as the case may be.
Sir WILFRIDIAwson has bet Sir CUTHBERT
QUILTER fifty dozen of soda water to one
cask of pure beer that the sale of intoxicating
liquors in the Houses of Parliament will not
be stopped by the present government.
Don CARLos offered to bet a castle in
Spain that he would obtain possession of
is kingdom before the Greek Calends, but
this offer has not been accepted.
Prince Victor NApoleoN has bet the Duc
D'ORLÉANs two half-crowns that the latter
will not be King of France on the First of
April next.
President KRUGER has made a bet with
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN that the Delagoa Bay
Arbitration will not be finished during this
century. The loser to entertain Mrs.
KRUGER to a cup of tea and a bath bun.
Mr. Swift MACNEILL has bet Sir M.

She. “I KNow. I was N'T BLAMING You.”
THE SORROWS OF A RISING YOUNG MAN.
(By Himself.)
As a boy I was remarkably small for my age, and morbidly sen-
sitive on the subject., Genial old gentlemen would inquire how
old I was, and never had sufficient tact to conceal their surprise
when I told them. Kindlier natures would pat me on the head
(which is exasperating even when the patter has not to stoop for
the purpose) and console me by the remark that “the best goods
were done up in the smallest parcels"—an aphorism that I con-
sidered then (and still ... a triumph of chuckle-headed
imbecility.
At school they thought even less of me than there was, and I
used to endeavour to increase my height by constant exercise upon
the trapeze and parallel bars; without success, for if I stretched at
all, it was only to contract immediately, like an elastic band.
In the holidays I consumed large quantities of pure yeast, which
I knew was used to make bread rise, and trusted might have a
similar effect upon me. . It certainly made my gorge rise, but that
was all, and I felt very low afterwards.
And then, without warning, whether the yeast really did begin
to work, or whether it was due to some more obscure cause, I
suddenly became aware that the cuffs of my, Eton jacket were
rapidly receding from my wrists, while my ankles stood exposed
to the gaze of the least observant. My overcoat, too, was shrink-
# like BALzAc's peau de chagrin. I remember that my parents
did not share my exhilaration at these discoveries—which I thought
unsympathetic of them.
But I was cheered by the marked increase of consideration
shown me by the º fellow in the school, whom I met at a
Christmas party, and who, with the most flattering condescension,
made an appointment to fight me the day after term began.
That fight, however, never came off, for on my return he indig-
nantly declined to meet me on the ground, which I was unable to
deny, that I had meanly taken advantage of the interval to grow
Now that I was once started I grew almost visibly. I was ner-
vously conscious of adding surreptitious cubits to my stature with
a persistency that, apologise as I might, I could not expect my
schoolfellows to overlook. Before I was fourteen my people, in
sheer humanity, promoted me to a tail-coat, which naturally
annoved the other fellows.
When we were marched to church on Sundays, I had to walk
behind with the head-master—to my exceeding discomfort (for he
was not an amusing companion), but there was nobody else tall
enough for me to pair off with. The general impression in the
school was that I was “trying to suck up " to him, and was getting
too big for my boots.
The holidays brought some compensations, however. Now that
I was nearly six feet high, I could hardly be packed off to bed at
nine. Moreover, I gained the affection of a young lady who was
really “out,” and had no suspicion that I was so much her junior.
We were secretly engaged; a fact which often consoled me at
school the next term, when I had to fag out at cricket, or got an
“impot” for cribbing a Greek exercise.
Alas! by the time we met again there was a marked distance
between us. She accused me of º down . her, and
implored me to pause before I went to lengths which I should
infallibly regret.
I would gladly have wired my head to my shoulders like a
champagne cork, had it been feasible—but it was not to be. We
had one last walk together in Kensington Gardens, when I recollect
that, in the violence of my emotions, I shot up at least three inches
between Bayswater Gate and the Albert Memorial, where she bade
me farewell, saying that our engagement must come to an end
since I seemed unable to do so.
I have since suspected that she had discovered that my pocket-
money, exclusive of casual tips, did not amount to more than half-
a-crown a week; but at least the world could not have said that,
in uniting herself to me, she would be marrying beneath her.
It seemed useless to go back to school or follow any particular
branch of study, for I had grown out of all knowledge, and no





out of his reach.
opening in life was large enough for me.

I should not have minded being a physician; but I was several
sizes too big for any professional brougham. I would have become
a parson, had I not felt certain that my sermons would be too far
above the heads of the most cultured congregation.
If I went to the Bar, where could I hope to find a solicitor suffi.
ciently enterprising enough to brief the whole of me?
There was the Stage, to be sure; but what prospect was there of
success when even so long a part as Hamlet would be so much too
short for me 3
It seemed to me, on reflection, that only one career remained
for me—a caravan. Socially, perhaps, it was a come down—but,
after all, there is no reason why a Giant should not remain a
Gentleman.
Accordingly I tried to rise to the situation—only to meet a suc-
cession of rebuffs.
Showman after Showman has told me bluntly that the market is
overcrowded, and that a mere Amateur Giant would stand no
chance against Professionals.
One of them added—and I did think it unkind of him—that if I
had happened to be a Dwarf now . . . but I did not stay to hear the
conclusion of his sentence.
Altogether, young as I am, I have already lost all pleasure in
life. I seem to have outgrown everything !
OUR BOOKING-OEFICE.
“I want no better tale of contrabandiers than Mr. MEADE
FALKNER's Moonfleet (EDward ARNoLD).” So says my nautical
Baronite, who ought to know. “And what is the why and the
wherefore? The Y is, plain enough to see in the cross-pall of the
arms of MoHUNE (which is Moon, tout court), the Dorsetshire
family that produced Blackbeard, that betrayed the King, that
gave him the diamond, that lay in the well, you must find out for
yourself. ...And the ‘wherefore,' is to be seen in something of the
iquant literary charm and last-century flavour of Kidnapped.
}} Mr. FALKNER does not attempt to present a pure romance, as
STEVENson did, without the element of woman's love, he relies
very little on this for his success. The story at the first is marked
by a pleasant, leisurely garrulity, but when it moves at its fastest,
the style never loses consistency. A glass with Mr. FALKNER of
the best “milk of Ararat, such as my noble host of the Why not *
knew well how to pour ! Let me be the ‘gauger' of all such
contraband as he gives us here, and he may run as many cargoes
as he likes.”
The Minor Baronite, to whom the B. de B.-W. has entrusted the
reviewing of some of the literary forces of the day, reports that he
has inspected The Lucky R. §. & Co.) Corps. The founder
of this detachment is one SAPTE, Junior, and if the M. B. be
not deceived, W. S., Jun., paraded his ideas on the stages of the
Vaudeville and Terry's Theatres some years ago with considerable
success, Peter, the hound, being, as now, the centre of attraction.
But even then Peter palled somewhat on the attention of the
critical observer. And yet the man or woman who wanted a
laugh forgave W. SAPTE, Junior, his very transparent trans-
essions against common sense and the language of the Queen,
ecause he managed to get some really funny situations. So it is
with the book, the capital cover of which has been drawn with the
prospect of a good run. When A Lucky Dog was on the stage,
many playgoers asked, “Who is W. SAPTE, Senior 2 and what
has he done?” The Minor Baronite repeats the question, and
can only surmise that the Senior SAPTE has encouraged the tale of
A Lucky Dog to wag in various places because he was certain that
it would bring reputation and reward to the Junior SAPTE. So
mote it be, in fact Verb. Sapte.

triumphantly comes out of the friendly conflict. The scene of the
new novel is also laid in Wales, of whose country and whose
people the author has intimate and loving knowledge. The
ground is new in the field of fiction and proves supremely attrac:
tive. The#. is novel, ingeniously devised, and cleverly worked
out. My Baronite, calon ſº warmly recommends the acquaint-
ance of Walmai Powell, her surroundings, her friends, and her

“As to ºpuſ Lyrics, were I. John LANE,” quoth the Baron,
“I wouldn't have troubled my Bodley Head about them, nor have
expended so much fancy on a very quaint cover, except perhaps
that this may constitute the book's principal attraction.” Some
of the illustrations are pretty, and not a few grotesquely humor-
ous. . The “Nonsense Rhymes” are better than either the
“Lyrics” or any of the other verses in the collection.

on his wayfaring. The young Storey, one of the earliest chapters,
so to speak, went to school in Paris, and in a pleased interval of
his studies watched the Revolution from the housetops. Varying
his position, he, like the insurgents, descended upon the streets
and narrowly escaped being shot. His account of the outbreak,
and of the measures taken for putting it down, though drawn from
the diary of a very small boy, are singularly graphic. After France
he went to Spain, sketching from memory, a gallery full of live
people. Making no pretence of writing a book, Mr. Storey has
produced a real good one.
It is almost startling to be reminded, as we are by Mrs.
RITCHIE's introduction to The Virginians, one of the latest volumes
of SMITH, ELDER's Biographical edition of THACKERAY, that at one
period the novelist earnestly desired to enter the House of Com-
mons. Nay, he actually stood for the city of Oxford, coming in at
the bottom of the . “And a very good thing, too,” says
Toby, M.P., who is º to know something of the
House. In 1857, when he made the attempt, he was forty-
six years old, far too advanced in life to make his mark at West-
minster. He would have been lost in a crowd of mediocrities,
would have been nowhere in the race with the "glib, blatant
BASHMEAD ARTLETTs of the day. He did much better when, address-
ing the electors after the poll had been declared, he undertook to
“retire and take my place with my pen and ink at my desk.” The
result was The Virginians, published in November of this same year,
worth a whole Session full of speeches addressed to Mr. SPEAKER.
THAcker AY's contest at Oxford is otherwise notable for one of the
neatest and most graceful compliments on record. Meeting in the
street Lord Monck, one of his opponents, he had a little friendly
talk over the prospects of the fight, and on taking leave said, “May
the best man win.” “I hope not,” said Lord Monck, with a
courtly bow and a meaning glance at his °F.". . . . . .

LORD GR-MTH-RPE'S COMMENTARIES.
No. W.-Lord G. on FAshions in Overcoats,
SIR,-Whatever may be the result and to suppose that I care
a rap which way they get it for me not being the sort of man to
whom at his or my time of life these things matter at all argues a
remarkable blindness in all of them except the late Archbishop
TAIT of the correspondence now being (or it might have been if
it had been properly treated which I don't know how it could be
with such a set of jackasses all blowing their own trumpets)
carried on I for one though when I come to compare myself with
some (Mr. HARRIson will do as an example of what I should mean
if I did it like he did) I feel that it is almost unfair to call myself
one and not two or three, however I shall always think it was right
of me to tackle them at once instead of leaving the matter to be
threshed out by a rabble who can't use the English language or
write as I once heard Lord PENZANCE say in the best judgment
that was ever delivered if not by him then by the rest of them and
can't argue pro mucibus aut toffeo.
And that brings me to the point which was what I intended to
fix them on all along which is or at least it was when I met them
in the Court of Arches ten years ago (was Mr. HARRIson there?
Of course how could he be why then should he keep going on like
this) a thing never dreamt of by the fools who framed the statute
de vestimentis superioribus (8 Car. II, cap 642), but then they tell
me it is the way of the world to take up or drop as they like a
garment of which all the pockets as anybody might have learnt at
school ought to be situated on the outside though never in the
collar and only rarely if never which is what Mr. HARRIsoN can't
deny though he is a brazen-faced impostor and cheap at that (is
that what he has been waiting for from me if so he has got it and
I trust he likes it more than I would under similar or merely
Now just observe what a pretty pass things were (or will if you
give them rope enough) come to. Am I to take º my parable
every day like this . rove them mendacious or but (I don't
want to wound any feelings they may think themselves though
everyone knows I don't think they are it would indeed be a
monstrous thing for any man of sense which they certainly are not
to think them entitled to so I will not use hard words but leave
them where I found them in which case even a mule or a prize
heifer will point the finger of scorn at them). Then of course
Mr. HARRIson is to come along walking delicately like AGAG did
and gird at my authorities but he will find that the bitterness of
death (which I may tell him is from the same quotation only he
doesn't know it) will never be past as long as I've got a word to
* about it or a newspaper column to say it in as loudly as ever
Can.
The fact is we must make no concession to these vermin. Give
them an inch (I shan't trust me for that) and off they go with a
cubit added on to their stature which naturally they can't do by
taking thought, and consequently it's only reasonable to suppose
and that's why I do it that they never can or will or have taken
thought in all their lives. And that makes the whole thing
absolutely clear to anyone who does not shut his ears when I try
to show it to them which I don't mean to go on doing much longer
only it's hard to be silent when you are talking to a lot of
nincompoops like them. Yours obediently,
GR-MTH-RPE.

LORD GR-MTH-RPE'S COMMENTARIES.
No. W.-Lord G. on FAshions IN Overcoats,
SIR,-Whatever may be the result and to suppose that I care
a rap which way they get it for me not being the sort of man tº
whom at his or my time of life these things matter at all argues a
remarkable blindness in all of them except, the late Archbishop
TAIt of the correspondence now being (or it might have been if
it had been properly treated which I don't know how it could be
with such a set of jackasses all blowing their own trumpets)
carried on I for one though when I come to compare myself with
some (Mr. HARRIson will do as an example of what I should mean
if I did it like he did) I feel that it is almost unfair to call myself
one and not two or three, however I shall always think it was right
of me to tackle them at once instead of leaving the matter to be
threshed out by a rabble who can't use the English language or
write as I once heard Lord PENzANCE say in the best judgment
that was ever delivered if not by him then by the rest of them and
can't argue pro mucibus aut toffeo.
And t .*. me to the point which was what I intended to
fix them on all along which is or at least it was when I met them
in the Court of Arches ten years ago (was Mr. HARRIsoN there?
Of course how could he be why then should he keep going on like
this) a thing never dreamt of by the fools who framed the statute
de vestimentis superioribus (8 Car. II, cap 642), but then they tell
me it is the way of the world to take up or drop as they like a
garment of which all the pockets as anybody might have learnt at
school ought to be situated on the outside though never in the
collar and only rarely if never which is what Mr. HARRIsoN can't
deny though he is a brazen-faced impostor and cheap at that (is
that what he has been waiting for from me if so he has got it and
I trust he likes it more than I would under similar or merely
Now just observe what a pretty pass things were (or will if you
give them rope enough) come to. Am I to take up my parable
every day like this and prove them mendacious or all but (I don't
want to wound any feelings they may think themselves though
everyone knows I don't think they are it would indeed be a
monstrous thing for any man of sense which they certainly are not
to think them entitled to so I will not use hard words but leave
them where I found them in which case even a mule or a prize
heifer will point the finger of scorn at them). Then of course
Mr. HARRIson is to come along walking delicately like AGAG did
and gird at my authorities but he will find that the bitterness of
death (which I may tell him is from the same quotation only he
doesn't know it) will never be past as long as I've got a word to
* about it or a newspaper column to say it in as loudly as ever
can.
The fact is we must make no concession to these vermin. Give
them an inch (I shan’t trust me for that) and off they go with a
cubit added on to their stature which naturally they can't do by
taking thought, and consequently it's only reasonable to suppose
and that's why I do it that they never can or will or have taken
thought in all their lives. And that makes the whole thing
absolutely clear to anyone who does not shut his ears when I try
to show it to them which I don't mean to go on doing much longer
only it's hard to be silent when you are talking to a lot of
nincompoops like them. Yours obediently,
GR-MTH-RPE.

4. Placing of pocket and pin-money on a
sound commercial basis, and cheerful com-
pliance with necessary reductions.
5. Abolition of domestic pets.
6. Suspension of cordial relations with the

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FRom the DiARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 13.
–Aproud day for the SAGE of QUEEN ANNE's
GATE. Pretty to see him leading the flower
of the Tory Party into the Lobby in resist-
ance of attack on integrity of a resolution
which, if carried, would have ended the
Lords. No pride about him. No haughty
elation in his mien. Same gliding step;
same readiness to efface himself; same
winning’smile as, this following were mere
vided favourable op -
up his captain with barbed spear-point,
§w. at a critical moment, his friends and
companions dear had turned upon him, and
who had come to his rescue 2 Why, the
Tories, whom he had spent an honourable
life in belittling and belabouring. -
The SAGE not subject to floods of emotion;
has, indeed, earned the character of a
cynic. But this too much for him. It was
with a curiously choked voice he cried
“Aye!” when the SPEAKER, put from the
chair his unmutilated amendment rescued
from burglarious hands. Rather thought
ortunity for touching- a little one, and was accepted for purely
hygienic reasons. PRINCE ARTHUR played
golf, consequently did not hold a single
directorship. But he (St. Michael) didn't
play golf. Must have some exercise. Office
of Economic Life Assurance Society is in
the City; Embankment leads to City; when
directorship offered him, at once occurred
to him that here was opportunity of strength-
ening and prolonging a life precious to the
Empire. #. accepted directorship.
“My right hon. friend the Leader of the
House,” to quote St. MICHAEL's own words,
“takes an hour's recreation at golf. I take
IN THEIR DECLINING YEARS.
“They all thoroughly believed in the Government—(laughter)—and he trusted that in their declining years they would remember this question of
land-tenure and rating in London.”—Mr. Bartley's Speech in the House of Commons.
Radicals, instead of, being Her Majesty's
Ministers and the bodyguard of the British
Constitution. Ecstasy of moment com-
pleted by fact that the Party he was about
to flout was the so-called Liberal Party,
commanded by his esteemed Leader,
CAWMELL-BANNERMAN.
“Nunc dimittis " " carolled the SAGE, as
he looked round; and all the congregation
said, “Amen l''
Triumph short-lived; joy fleeting. The
SAGE had moved an amendment to Address
providing that in the event of a Bill passing
the Commons being thrown out in the Lords
and carried again in the next session in the
Commons, the QUEEN shall forthwith give
the Royal Assent. CAwmELL-BANNERMAN,
whilst heartily agreeing in the attack on
autocratic position of the Lords, demurred
on technical grounds to form of amendment.
Put up Lawson WAlton to move another.
Question submitted from the Chair took the
form of eliminating words from the SAGE's
motion in order to substitute LAwson
WALTo N’s.
It was on this issue that PRINCE ARTHUR
rallied his men round the standard of the
SAGE, ºl. CAwMELL-BANNERMAN and
his men by majority of 150. Now the way
seemed clear for completion of victory. A
Ministerial majority had declared in favour
of the integrity of the SAGE's amendment,
indignantly repelling insidious attack from
Opposition. Only thing to do now was to
formally affirm it, and enter it on the
iournals of the House. A look of almost
eavenly contentment suffused the SAGE's
countenance. All his life he had fought
under the banner of the Liberal flag, a
PRINCE ARTriur, having saved it from de-
struction, would have proposed the Govern-
ment Tellers should take charge of the
division. That a mere detail. Possibly from
feeling of chivalry the Leader of House
would not supersede him in command on
the eve of victory. Did not OUTRAM, arriv-
ing at Lucknow, armed with complete
civil and military authority, decline to
supersede HAVELock, who had done all the
fighting?
Musing on these matters, the SAGE beheld
a strange sight. The Ministerialists, having
beaten off the would-be mutilators of the
amendment, now closed up their ranks,
made a dash upon the rescued party and
rolled it ignominiously out of the House by
a majority of 118!
“Well, I never,” said the SAGE.
Business done.-PRINCE ARTHUR conducts
a strategic movement in defence of the
House of Lords.
Tuesday.—Interesting biographical detail
came out in debate to-night. Swift
MAcNEILL, who, since SPEAKER took the
Chair, has been all over the place in his
favourite character of the bull in a china
shop, called attention to tireless energy of
Her Majesty's Ministers. Not content with
serving their country, it appears that out
of forty-four Ministers of the Crown twenty-
five hold no fewer than forty-one director-
ships in public companies. As MAcNEILL
mentioned this fact, peculiar noise, as of the
smacking of lips, heard on back benches.
Many eyes turned with envious glance
towards Treasury Bench.
Hicks-BEACH undertaking to extenuate
this embarrassment of riches, admitted that
my hour's recreation in a walk along the
Embankment and a short attendance at the
Board of the Society.”
There it is; so simple, so natural, so
logical.
“But couldn't you,” said SARK, “take
your hour's walk on the Embankment and
stop short of the door of the Economic Life
Assurance Society and its little fee?”
That's the worst of SARK. He's always
going a point further than is compatible
with polite conversation. Glad to say St.
Michael, momentarily communing with
All Angels, didn't hear him.
Business dome.—Talking round the Ad-
dress.
Thursday.—Ministerialists of the better
sort getting a little tired of REDMondaine and
his rhetorical attacks on the political party
that ruined themselves and their cause by ad-
vocating Home Rule. Well enough once in
a decade to come back in joyous mood after
dinner, sit and hear blatant middle-aged
young man snap at the hand that fed him.
But the exhibition palls upon repetition.
To-night, any measure of success possible
was marred by accident that the turn came
on in the dinner hour. Later or earlier in
the dull tide of miscellaneous debate round
the Address, good Unionists would have
been in their places to watch the antiquated
. Not good enough to justify sacrifice
of dinner. So they cleared out, and carefully
framed, sedulously polished, turgid sentences
rolled over empty benches.
Courtesy compelled attendance of
CAwMELL-BANNERMAN. House filled up to
hear his reply, and prepare for the division.

Professor Mysto (the celebrated Palmist, to Miss Priscilla Giddy).
“This LINE INDICATEs that when You ARE About Twenty-FIVE
YEARs of AGE You will, MAKE THE AcquaintANCE of A GENTLE-
MAN whom You WILL PROBABLY MARRY.”
[Professor Mysto, being unable to ask any specific fee for his services,
leaves the amount to the generosity of his Patrons.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Baron having a strong º of Yº: and
eager to recognise the genuine article when it comes in his way, is
mightily astonished that A Mystery & the Campagna, by Won
DEGEN (Pseudonym Library, FISHER UNwiN), was not brought to
his notice when it first appeared. It is now in its fourth edition,
and deservedly so. Let any amateur of vampires read this book,
and verily he will not be disappointed. The second story in the
little volume hath about it a charm of a totally different kind.
'Tis a brief episode in a lifetime; sad, but not thrilling; a story of
contrasts.
The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Barrett
(SMITH, ELDER) make one of the most ‘. love stories in the
language. At first sight it is an impossibly delicate thing
to publish for reading in parlour and kitchen the intimate
correspondence of a man and woman whom all the world
knows by name, and some of us knew in the flesh. BRowNING
was so punctilious of the sacredness of letters, that before his
death he destroyed all his other correspondence. Yet he gave this
cherished block to his son, saying, “There they are. Do with
them as you please when I am dead and gone.” Mr. BRowNING
has pleased to publish them, and through all time mankind and
womankind º be pleased to read them. It is no new thing in
English literature for a novel to be written in the form of letters.
The fashion has gone out since Evelina charmed the town. At
the close of the nineteenth century it reappears in most perfect
form. . There is one absolutely original and unique touch in the
plot of this romance. The lovers were in love before they set
eyes upon each other.
that point before. Where all is good it is invidious to discriminate,
but it must be said that, on the whole, the woman's letters are
No novelist, however daring, has hit on
better than the man's. BRowNING's prose style, especially when
he analyses that fascinating subject himself, is not free from the
elaborate obscurity that mars much of his verse. Miss BARRETT
makes charming confession of her own difficulty in this matter.
“I, as a woman,” she writes, in her second letter, “have studied
some of your gestures of language and intonation, wistfully as a
thing beyond me far, and,” adds this very first member of the
BRowNING Society, “the more admirable for being beyond me.”
That's all very well for one in love. Plain people prefer language
that can be understanded of them. CARLYLE once told Miss
BARRETT she would do better to write prose than verse.
That was not encouraging for a young poet, but it is justified by
these Letters. If he were still around, my Baronite would like to
look over the shoulders of ELIZABETH's father, a sort of Dombey-
iMIgAwper-BARRETT, whilst he read this correspondence, remem-
bering how on her marriage he turned his pompous back on his
gifted daughter. Among the marvels of creation is the fact that
he should have had such a daughter and she such a father.
My Baronite is not familiar with the name of Flora HAINEs
LoughEAD, but if The Black Curtain (DUckworth) is her first
novel, she has straightway made her mark. The plot is marked
by some good old melodramatic traits. Its turnings, long-
frequented, are a little obvious. But the characters, more
especially the voiceless singer and the blinded painter, who by
such good chance come together in the wilderness, are live people.
A peculiar charm of the book is its setting in unfamiliar hills of
California, the light and colour, the breezy air of which suffuse the
Pºg. with refreshing zest.
AIRD's History of Corsica (T. F. UNwiN) is a most useful and
instructive book, and will interest even those who do not profess to
have ever Caird much for the subject before. “But,” observes the
Baronite (of a dramatic turn), who has undertaken to offer his
opinion, “there is one singular and striking omission, as nowhere
can I find any mention of, or remotest allusion to, The Corsican
Brothers. Odd 1 ''
Dr. BARRY's The Two Standards (FIsher UNwiN) is a very
remarkable work. Wagnerism, Capitalism, Evangelicalism, Mes-
merism, Socialism, and a good many other “isms,” figure in his
}. and every theme is touched with the master's hand. Dr.
ARRY is not only a literary artist of consummate skill—in this
book his painting is in the style of REMBRANDT-but also a pro:
found philosopher. Hence his subtle and skilful analysis of
character, his precise and powerful diagnosis of human nature.
“He knows what's what; and that's as deep
As metaphysic wit can peep.”
“A book to read—and to read carefully,” says
The BARoN DE B.-W.
WITH ARMY ESTIMATES.
(Fragment not to be found in a Blue Book.)
THE War Office clerk and the Yeomanry trooper were examining
the proposed military expenditure.
“A net increase of £1,396,700,” said the man of the Pen.
“Yes; quite enough, too,” replied he of the Sword, “but it is
satisfactory to think it is no worse.”
“Between four thousand and five thousand new soldiers,”
observed the clerk. “Well, I suppose they are wanted.”
“Yes,” acquiesced the cavalryman, “they will be, needed in
these days of increased establishments beyond the sea.”
“Recruiting tempered with desertion will go on as before. And
the warlike stores take a lot.”
“Must have new guns and new barracks."
“The Wolunteers have an increase of £10,000."
“And the Militia about double the money.”
So far Pen and Sword saw nothing to surprise them. But
at length the first started.
There is no increase in the votes
What can be the cause of

that ?”
“Perhaps the War Office and the Yeomanry are considered past
improving.”
MYSTERY AT ECCLES.
IN a descriptive account of the new Theatre at Eccles (morelation
to the tipsy old father in Caste), the Manchester Courier says:—
“We ought to say that the execution of the builder and decorator has
quite, if not more than, realised the hopes of the architect.”
Alas! . Poor builder and decorator Was, the execution by
decapitation, or º hanging? In the first case, both must have lost
their heads; in the second, they have been “suspended.” Sad.
|But what a cruel architect ' What a crafty designer And to
think how his plans have met with unqualified success Terrible !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
LE LENDEMAIN DE CARNAVAL.
ALL down the boulevards ankle-deep
Last night the bright confetti lay;
When with the dawn we turned to sleep
Besom and hose had had their way;
And now the world, swept clean of colour,
Looks good, and feels distinctly duller.
Still sadly gay from leafless trees
The draggled serpentin depends,
witness of wanton revelries
For which we mean to make amends,
Who go with ashes on our head,
And deem the ancient Adam dead.
Yet while the Flesh refused to die,
And through the crowds, serenely
“gras,”
The reckless urban fiacre (or fly)
Could barely circulate au pas,
It was a beauteous sight to see
How bosoms beatin harmony |
Fº all the cross-intrigues
Of that inconsequent Affaire;
Silent the roar of patriot Leagues
That usually rend the air;
The warrior kindly waived his feud,
And left the Hebrew unconspued.
Duels were fought with even less
Than honour's customary risks;
The paper-battles of the Press
Were only waged with coloured discs;
Only the air-inflated bomb
Argued the obvious “droits de l'homme.”
Yet you misjudge us over there !
You find us torn with party-strife,
So French, you say, so unaware
Of what ºld weld the nation's life;
Nor notice, when we do agree,
How great our unanimity!
Let but the common need arise,
The psychologic moment come,
At once the sound of discord dies,
And half a hundred creeds are dumb ;
Can a Republic be so petty
Which thus combines to chuck confetti &
Your views of us have seldom been
Quite as enlightened as they should ;
These narrow seas that roll between
Have made us so misunderstood;
The aims that move our noblest men
Seem to elude your local ken.
And, en revanche, beneath the stress
Of this constraining truce of Lent,
Our ignorance we here confess;
We too have sinned to some extent;
We fail to follow, though we try,
Some of your choicest genii.
We spell their names—a thankless task, -
And get no sort of guiding clue;
We read heroic things and ask
“Qui est-ce que c'est cet inconnu : ""
And yet of old a prophet's arts
Were most at home in foreign parts!

A PLAYGOER'S NIGHTMARE.
I'd had some supper after the play,
And enjoyed, it must be confessed,
An imprudent dish—so the croakers say—
That's a crab divinely “dressed.”
Some hours later, I pledge my word,
A strange thing happened—Gadzooks!
I fancy that phrase has also occurred
In RIDER HAGGARD, his books—
The Ambassador sat on the end of my bed
With his arm round the Runaway Girl,
Whilst the Three Musketeers, each man on
his head,
Saluted that amorous Earl.
A sad Court Scandal indeed! I lay
And listened—I “make no bones"—
For that was clearly The Only Way
To discover What Happened to Jones.
Then off we went to Lord Algy's flat,
In a hansom we all packed in;
The Forty Thieves were a trifle fat,
But the Belle of New York was thin.
We picked White Heather in Oxford Street,
And the Greek Slave tried to sell;
No ship was like Ours in all the fleet,
Though the Jane manoeuvred well.
Lady Ursula borrowed the bo'sun's kit,
Which every one managed to guess,
But Little Miss Nobody cried a bit
A Ray of Sunshine appeared that night,
Or perhaps 'twas a Lucky Star,
And Alice went back to her land all bright,
And Milord Sir Smith to the Bar.
We bicycled hurriedly night and day

With occasional games of loo.

A PLAYGOER'S NIGHTMARE.
I'd had some supper after the play,
And enjoyed, it must be confessed,
An imprudent dish—so the croakers say—
That's a crab divinely “dressed.”
Some hours later, I pledge my word,
A strange thing happened—Gadzooks!
I fancy that phrase has also occurred
In RIDER HAGGARD, his books—
The Ambassador sat on the end of my bed
With his arm round the Runaway Girl,
Whilst the Three Musketeers, each man on
his head,
Saluted that amorous Earl.
A sad Court Scandal indeed! I lay
And listened—I “make no bones"—
For that was clearly The Only Way
To discover What Happened to Jones.
Then off we went to Lord Algy's flat,
In a hansom we all packed in;
The Forty Thieves were a trifle fat,
But the Belle of New York was thin.
We picked White Heather in Oxford Street,
And the Greek Slave tried to sell;
No ship was like Ours in all the fleet,
Though the Jane manoeuvred well.
Lady Ursula borrowed the bo'sun's kit,
hich every one managed to guess,
But Little Miss Nobody cried a bit
A Ray of Sunshine appeared that night,
Or perhaps 'twas a Lucky Star,
And Alice went back to her land all bright,
And Milord Sir Smith to the Bar.
We bicycled hurriedly night and day
On and Off for a week or two,
It was Lavender, Lavender all the way,
With occasional games of loo.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
REMARKS AD REM-BRANDT.
EveRYBoDy to be anybody must be born somewhere: and REM-
BRANDT made his first appearance at Leyden. His father was
a miller, one HARMEN §. or “Grits" (sometimes, but
erroneously, spelt with an “e"), a name in that country and at that
eriod, 1606, significantly descriptive of the Miller's harsh manner.
hy he inserted an “s” before the “z” has never been ascertained.
The future painter's mother was a baker's daughter, so celebrated
as “The Owl,” that even SHAksPEARE makes complimentary
allusion to her in the ravings of Ophelia. . Some Owls are
beautiful, and Madame GERRITsz being one of these notable ex-
ceptions was considered the flour of the Miller's family. That
she had a thorough-bred style goes without saying, º y when,
en boulangère, she had her hair done up in a roll with a “bun,” at
the top. Young REMBRANDT signed himself. “WAN RYN "(of the
Rhine) as did his father and uncle before him, and in their most
festive moments GERRITsz would address his wife, in song, as “My
Old Dutch,” with a jovial chorus of
“WAN RYN's a merry family,
W.R. W.R. 1 W.R. 1"
The youthful REMBRANDT determined to be an artist; studied
first under one master then under another, until he finished, appro-
º enough, with LASTMAN. . After this, for three or four years,
e had a rough time of student life, and frequently when sufficient
grist from the mill at home was not forthcoming to defray his ex-
penses, he would merrily go to Mynheer WAN PornBRocKER, singing
Popgoes the easel,” and pop it went until redeemed by REMBRANDT
Reimbursed, for, at this period, he could draw anything but money
out of the bank or cheques on it. He soon discovered that Amster-
dam was the place to live in, and finding that most of its citizens
would become sitters, he himself very soon became a squatter.
REMBRANDT was so devoted to his art that when he had nothing
else to do he would paint himself over and over again. There
was no necessity for }. to owe large sums to his tailor, as he
could º: give himself a fresh coat of paint. His signature
varied, as does that of most men at various times. Once he wrote
“van rym" thus: “van ryn,” but as this occurs only in the
marriage register, it may be fairly presumed that, on such an
exceptional occasion, he might have been a little “off his head,”
and so may have momentarily “gone a bit dotty.” This is the
“wherefore ” of the “y.” It is true that his wife brought him a
big dowry, quite equal to two ordinary “dots.”. But this is
being speaking likenesses, tell their own story, and, if they don't,
you can “refer to drawer,” or, if you have not REMBRANDT's
eminiscences at hand, turn to the instructive R.A. Catalogue,
which, for the ridiculously small sum of sixpence, you will obtain
from a custodian in the hall of Burlington House. Then “ite ad
astra”—go upstairs and enjoy yourself.

Strangel Yet evidently R. v. R. considered this subject “meet”
for his brush.
Rare Rabbis, Marvellous Men and Wonderful Women: the
majority being very ancient. The great painter of “Old Folks
at Home" should have had another cognomen, “Rembrandt von
Wrinkle.” There are only two good-looking young people in the
collection; and the specimen (59) of A Young Man of the period is
not flattering, though probably true. The lace collars, the armour,
and the velvet stuffs, all things of beauty and joys for ever. To
see those wonderful Rabbis will make you wish. that you could
have been one of them to have been so immortalised. Then you
| could have said, had you been inclined that way, “What's the
odds as long as you're Rabbi ?—and painted by REMBRANDT WAN

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRoxt THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 20.
—Mr. LECKY is more than disappointed with
the Atlantic. He is positively accusatory.
Debate on to-night about distress in West o
"Tº --
-
- - º
L-CKY AND THE
Ireland. JoHN REDMond says it's all due
to TIM HEALY. TIM lays the blame at
the door of John DILLoN. John DILLoN,
striking out a fresh path, discerns the Father
of Evil in HoRACE PLUNKETT. Mr. LEcky
says it's the Atlantic.
That seems to settle the matter. You
cannot, BURKE said on a famous occasion,
frame an indictment against a nation.
Similarly you cannot have the Atlantic
taken up and put in the dock, as if it were a
Town or County Councillor under PRINCE
ARTHUR's abortive Irish Local Government
Bill. So there we must leave the matter.
Question of Irish distress has long baffled
statesmen. Comes along LECKY, 5...
with history of European morals from
AUGUSTUs to CHARLEMAGNE, casts his eye
round, and with it sternly fixes the abashed
Atlantic.
House shows disposition to smile at turn
given affairs. SARK tells me the idea by
no means new. Cannot at the moment
quote date and text, but has clear recollec-
tion of hearing Dizzy, speaking some
twenty-five years ago, trace the tempera-
ment of Irishmen and all it portends to
“the melancholy ocean.”
DILLoN's discourse on Horace PLUNKETT
very interesting. Housegenerally regards the
member for South Dublin as a phenomenal
Irish member. An aristocrat by birth, a
landlord by associations, a Conservative by
education and conviction, he has devoted
his life to promotion of material interests of
the Irish farmer. Is an active member of
the Congested Districts Board, founded Irish
Agricultural Organisation Society, succeeded
by some rare necromancy in uniting men of
º political factions in its administration.
SARK says, “If all Irish members were like
HoRAGE PLUNKETT there would, in spite of
the Atlantic Ocean, be no Irish Question.”
SARK for once in his life mistaken, a con-
dition suffered with many other impartial
ATLANT1c OCEAN.
observers. John DILLoN's steely glance has
ierced PLUNKETT's borrowed wrappings.
e cares nothing for the cause of Ireland or
the welfare of the people. He is, or was,
before the Röntgen Rays were turned upon
him, a secret political emissary. He talks
fair and works hard with apparently honest
kindly effort. Really, he cares no *f; for
Ireland or the welfare of its people. e is
a mere politician, working for political ends.
Now, if there's anything rudely shocking
to an Irish member, it is conduct such as
this. No wonder that while he spoke a
tremor of pained indignation shook John
DILLON's voice, and that a moan, rather of
sorrow than of anger, passed along the
benches over whose financial arrangements
the late Joseph GILLIs BIGGAR once genially
presided. -
Business done.—PRINCE ARTHUR, anxious
above all things for expansive freedom of
speech, declines to move closure. Debate
on Address accordingly adjourned till to-
morrow. Incidentally, debate about Bishops
in Parliament, which might prove awkward
at present juncture, is displaced from its
place on to-morrow night's Orders.
Tuesday.—What's to be dome with Lord
HUGH CECIL? He's the daring duckling
of the Hatfield brood. Never know where
you have him, or what he'll do next.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRoxt THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, February 20.
—Mr. Lecky is more than disappointed with
the Atlantic. He is positively accusatory.
Debate on to-night about distress in West o
º
ºutº sº
L-cKY AND THE
Ireland. JoHN REDMond says it's all due
to TIM HEALY. TIM lays the blame at
the door of John DILLoN. John DILLoN,
striking out a fresh path, discerns the Father
of Evil in HoRACE PLUNKETT. Mr. LEcky
says it's the Atlantic.
That seems to settle the matter. You
cannot, BURKE said on a famous occasion,
frame an indictment against a nation.
Similarly you cannot have the Atlantic
taken up and put in the dock, as if it were a
Town or County Councillor under PRINCE
ARTHUR's abortive Irish Local Government
Bill. So there we must leave the matter.
Question of Irish distress has º baffled
statesmen. Comes along LECKY, bubbling
with history of European morals, from
AUGUSTUs to CHARLEMAGNE, casts his eye
round, and with it sternly fixes the abashed
Atlantic.
House shows disposition to smile at turn
given affairs. SARK tells me the idea by
no means new. Cannot at the moment
quote date and text, but has clear recollec-
tion of hearing Dizzy, speaking some
twenty-five years ago, trace the tempera-
ment of Irishmen and all it portends to
“the melancholy ocean.”
DILLoN's discourse on Horace PLUNKETT
very interesting. Housegenerally regards the
member for South Dublin as a phenomenal
Irish member. An aristocrat by birth, a
landlord by associations, a Conservative by
education and conviction, he has devoted
his life to promotion of material interests of
the Irish farmer. Is an active member of
the Congested Districts Board, founded Irish
Agricultural Organisation Society, succeeded
by some rare necromancy in uniting men of
º political factions in its administration.
SARK says, “If all Irish members were like
HoRACE PLUNKETT there would, in spite of
the Atlantic Ocean, be no Irish Question.”
SARK for once in his life mistaken, a con-
dition suffered with many other impartial
ATLANT1c OCEAN.
observers. John DILLoN's steely glance has
H. PLUNKETT's borrowed "...}}.
e cares nothing for the cause of Ireland or
the welfare of the people. He is, or was,
before the Röntgen Rays were turned upon
him, a secret political emissary. He talks
fair and works hard with apparently honest
kindly effort. Really, he cares not *f; for
Ireland or the welfare of its people. e is
a mere politician, working for political ends.
Now, if there's anything rudely shocking
to an Irish member, it is conduct such as
this. No wonder that while he spoke a
tremor of pained indignation shook John
DILLoN's voice, and that a moan, rather of
sorrow than of anger, passed along the
benches over whose financial arrangements
the late Joseph GILLIs BIGGAR once genially
presided. -
Business done.—PRINCE ARTHUR, anxious
above all things for expansive freedom of
speech, declines to move closure. Debate
on Address accordingly adjourned till to-
morrow. Incidentally, debate about Bishops
in Parliament, which might prove awkward
at present juncture, is displaced from its
place on to-morrow night's Orders.
Tuesday.—What's to be dome with Lord
Hugh CECIL? He's the daring duckling
of the Hatfield brood. Never know where
you have him, or what he'll do next.
Good deal of talk about House of Lords.
Mend it or end it a suggested alternative.
Lord Hugh is, naturally, for mending it.

ADVICE TO AN AMBASSADOR.

American Ambassador not to talk too much after
dinner.”—Westminster Gazette.]
DEAR Mr. CH-TE, full well I know 't,
You are a charming fellow;
Your wit is bright, your sallies light,
Your wisdom ripe and mellow;
But when one dines, with sundry wines,
Unless one is teetotal,
One's very apt, on being clapped,
To grow—well, anecdotal.
When wine is in, wit waxeth thin,
And when a man is heated
With good Tokay, he'll often say
What shouldn't be repeated.
I fancy you remember who
In this way proved a sinner ?
I beg you, then, be careful when
Orating after dinner.
This game to you is somewhat new,
So pray observe my warning:
Words that seemed light, said overnight,
Look different in the morning.
If, therefore, you intend to woo
Diplomacy, and win her,
Mind how you walk, and do not talk
Too freely after dinner.
A Sound Definition.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN A Son of Empire (HUTCHINson) Mr. MoRLEY Roberts gives
a splendidly vivid account of the storming of a snow-sentinelled
pass in India during the most recent of our little wars. The cam-
paign gave birth to some admirable descriptions written on the
spot., For the almost brutal power of reproducing the sights and
sounds of battle, my Baronite does not remember anything that
beats the chapters which tell how Black Blundell and Billy Gretton
made their way into the lair of the Gulis. How Captain Blundell,
who happened to have made a bitter enemy of the Adjutant-General
at home, got his great chance of service at the front is the pith of a
story which those who like a hearty rousing book will do well to
order forthwith. As for Madge Gretton, she is delightful.
In Infatuation (CHATTo AND WINDUs), B. M. Croker, amongst
9ther live personages, has achieved two excellent portraitures.
One is that of Mrs. Pegrim, the selfish, domineering, wealthy
woman of the type that lives in large houses at Brighton and
Bath. The other is Mamie Fontaine, the beautiful, bright, breezy
American who moves through the conventionalities of Ejiº,
upper middle-class Society with the freshness of a gust of wind
over the prairies. Maria Talbot, evidently meant for the heroine,
is much too good for my Baronite's daily food. Perhaps it
is all part of the subtle art of the novelist. Miss Talbot's pro-
voking submission to her termagant, tyrant aunt, certainly serves
to make more striking and welcome the scene in which the Ameri-
can girl, calls in at Regency Square, Brighton, and lets the old
woman have it right and left. The book is not intellectually ex-
haustive. . But it is brightly written, full of go from start to
finish, and, for a novel, the author therein chooses the better part.
The Duke's Serrants (GAY AND BIRD) are not those of his own
household, but the company of strolling players who enjoyed
the patronage of the Duke of BucKINGHAM, just now him-
self upon the stage in the Three Musketeers. Mr. BURCHELL
has made a Fº loving study of the time of which
he treats, and is successful in picturesquely reproducing some
of its episodes. He has not hesitated to introduce historical
personages on his canvas, including the Duke of BuckINGHAM and
his assassin FELToN. . According to my Baronite's testimony, the
most real personage in the º: is the old lawyer, Job
Grapplefee.
As in a Looking Glass, by F. C. PHILIPs, has been re-issued by
Mr. HEINEMANN in one volume, with Mr. GEoRGE DU MAURIER's
illustrations, which, having been originally intended for a large
édition de lure, now appear in reduced circumstances. The novel,
which came out . .. before Mr. PINERo's Second Mrs.
Tanqueray, between which lady and the heroine of the novel there
is a sort of family resemblance, even down to the last scene that
ends the strange eventful history, is as much a story of to-day as it
was of yesterday, and will be of to-morrow. DU MAURIER's
heroine seems too ladylike throughout the series, but the effect of
the utter desolation of death, as expressed in the frontispiece, is
most powerful. THE BARON DE B.-W.
HOW TO SPEND A HAPPY DAY IN CHINA.
(Extract from the diary of a Traffic Manager—in anticipation.)
[“China is breaking up before our eyes, and the future will lie with the
nations who understand what to do in such conditions.”—Daily Paper.]
I THINK after all I shall get matters fairly ship-shape. Had it
not been for that skirmish with the enemy º Mi I cutting, which
stopped the mineral traffic for six weeks, it is quite likely that we
might have been able to declare a dividend. But what can a
Traffic Manager do when his time-table is subject to the interference
of land torpedoes? And this sort of outrage does a great deal of
harm with the travelling public. The Chinese are accustomed to
an abrupt termination to their existence; still, an average, well-
conditioned Celestial excursionist prefers getting home to supper to
being blown to pieces in a tunnel. These surprises, d la Chinois,
may be Pºlº but they are not business. Under the circum-
stances, I have had to take the necessary precautions to secure
the tranquil progress of our Chinese Bank Holiday Special.
Of course, there was little difficulty about starting it. We
timed it to leave at 4 A.M., before the hostile portion of the
native population were up, and a company of the Blankshire
Regiment easily cleared the streets for those having tickets
distributed in advance. The land, mines were cleared away
without damage early, before the hour of departure, and the
bombs are now in safe custody. Our armoured engine was a
eat success, and we made the first ten miles of the journey by
* º few thousand rounds of blank cartridge. This was
amply sufficient to put to flight the Tartar horsemen (commanded
by officers of European extraction) who made a demonstration at
Nurse. “Now, Miss EFFIE, You Must BE VERY RIND To Your
SISTER's Little BABY, AND LovE HER v ERY Much.”
Effie (much hurt). “No, I won't. It's Too BAD. FATHER CALLs
BABY HIs BLEssED GRAND CHILD, AND only cALLs ME his Little
EFFIE. WHY, I'M Five TIMEs THE SIZE of THAT MITE!”
Our first serious difficulty appears to have arisen at Hang Wan
Junction. Upon the arrival of the Chinese Bank Holiday Speci
the Refreshment Department was found to be strongly occupied
by a force of Irregular Archers. The arrows from these warriors
caused considerable annoyance to some of our first-class passengers,
who would put their heads out of the windows (contrary to the
Company's regulations) to see what was the matter. Fortunately,
the Chinese, in their hurry, had forgotten to dip their shafts in
poison, so the casualties were few and unimportant. . A mandarin
of enlightened views was slightly wounded, but as he had somehow
or other managed to gain hittance to the train without a ticket
the Company was released from any pecuniary obligation. To
emphasise this fact, he was at once arrested, and will be charged
: ang Wang Police Court for travelling without paying his
are.
On leaving the Junction, the Chinese Bank Holiday Special
started at full speed and got to Rum Go Hiten minutes before the
time advertised for its arrival. This was most satisfactory, as the
enemy were out in their reckoning. The Chinese have a kind of
native cuteness, which sometimes over-reaches itself. Fully
aware of European customs, they had counted upon the excursion
being an hour and twenty minutes late, and consequently, were
lunching four miles off when the Special steamed into the station.
And now I am called away to the telephone.
Later.—Things have shaped themselves satisfactorily. The guard
in charge of the Chinese Bank Holiday Special wired to the central
office for instructions. It appears that after the luncheon, the enemy
disappeared, and the excursionists were consequently able to spend
a more or less happy day at Rum Go Hi. However, when it was
time to return, it was discovered that the rails had been taken up for
sixteen miles, and the track converted into tea-gardens. Under these
circumstances, our travellers have converted themselves into a
colony nominally under the Company's protection. They are doing
fairly well at P. living upon sponge cakes and ginger-beer—
the remains of the stock of refreshments at Hang Wang Junction.
Naturally, as they are unable to use them, the return halves of
their railway tickets will not be available for further conveyance.
This will be a distinct saving to the Company. However, after
mature deliberation, it has been decided by our Board of Directors
not to run another Chinese Bank Holiday Special—for the present.

THE RETURN OF “OUR MR. BERESFORD,”
Lord CHARLEs BEREspoRD sailed for England on Wednesday, March 1.
Before sailing, ha told a deputation that “he had succeeded in assisting
England and America to act together.”
“OURS" AND YEARS.
WHEN all the world was young, ToM Robertson's Ours caught
the public taste almost as much as his Caste. Even in those
“green and salad days” of the drama, when Mr. BANCROFT was
the inimitable “haw-haw” swell, and when Mrs. BANCROFT was
already enormously popular as the MARIE WILTON of the rollickin
old Strand burlesque period, the third act of Ours was considere
weak. But, for all that, it “went "with roars of laughter as long
as the two favourites were on the stage, making a pantomime
Fº playing with the rolling-pin, and roasting a “property.”
eg of mutton, while a portion of the British army, invisible to the
audience, was supposed to be taking part in a sanguinary engage-
ment somewhere “in the front,” not “of the house,” but at the
back of the stage, or, in technical theatrical parlance, “off.”
“Cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them,” and the spec-
tators shuddered to think what had become of all the dramatis
persona, of whom, with the exception of this comic ".
making couple, the stage seemed to have been cleared at one
fell swoop.
But without the BANCROFTs, and in the
up-to-date audience, what a mere hap-hazard charade, what a thin
piece of workmanship, does Robertson's Ours º: Even the
finish of the second act, with the shouting couple at the window,
and the fainting heroine in front (Miss MABEL TERRY-LEwis faints,
and acts, effectively), while “without" (all the effects are “with-
out") the Colonel is heard shouting his commands, the band is
heard playing, the troops are heard marching, even with all this
expenditure of energy, this finish of the second act, once the great
success of the piece, is comparatively tame and flat.
Mr. John HARE, as the Russian Prince Perovsky, is as good as he
ever was, probably better; but now-a-days the audience, regarding
the character with wonder, ask themselves, “How is this? HARE
has absolutely nothing to do I!” Nor has he. Very little has he to
†. and that little not particularly brilliant, but positively nothing
whatever to do. Ours disillusions us. It is of the past. We are
delighted to have seen it once again, and so to have learnt where
exactly to place Tom Robertson as a dramatist of his own short
day, whose work was not intended to live for all time.
r. FREDERIck KERR, as Hugh Chalcot, has to carry the entire

consequently had to go to Voluntary School.
Availing themselves of Conscience Clause,
these sturdy Roundheads withdrew when

so serious that no words in his dictionary
would adequately describe it. Taking it for
granted that he would, as usual, be counted

the subject for some twenty minutes, he, in
a manner ever child-like and bland, took
the House into his confidence.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Baron congratulates MARY Johnston on her romantic story
entitled The Old Dominion (ARCHIBALD CoNstABLE & Co.), “being
an account of certain prisoners of hope. A tale, of Colonial Vir:
ginia.” It is an exciting narrative of perilous adventures, and of
a hate that was converted into love as strong as death. The
characters are drawn with a strong hand, and the interest is sus-
tained to the end. Yet there is a fault which the Baron must
mention for the sake of the many readers who follow his experienced
advice, and this fault lies in a sameness of incident and a proneness
to stray into lengthy dialogue, which, however individually charac.
teristic it may be, is but a weariness of the spirit to the reader,
unless he be an experienced “skipper” and a master of the craft.
With advantage to writer, seller, and reader, this book might have
been shorn of at least one-fourth of its proportions. The finish, bein
unfinished, is unsatisfactory. The Baron is somewhat puzzle
by the spelling; as for example" gayly.” for “gaily.” If an “i.
is to be sacrificed, then of course “daily" must be written “dayly,”
and why should not MARY Johnston be spelt “MARI Jonston"?
Then MARI is of a frugal mind with regard to the letter “l,” and
having taken an inch here and there, phonetically, she proceeds to
rob poor weary “travellers” of their second liquid, as though she
considered one liquid to have been quite as much as they could
carry. So “trayellers" become “travelers.” Then “levelled ”
she spells “leveled.” Now, though the effect be strange to the
eye, yet is the Baron not disinclined towards “the new learning,”
as having much that is sensible to say for itself. “Ought" for
“aught” is unreasonable unless “naught” and “naughty” are to
be spelt “nought” and “noughty.” “Defenseless” is surely in-
defensible for “defenceless; ” is not this to muddle the French
“defense” with the English “defence” 2 Still the Baron is
inclined to the opinion that spelling, according to Sam Weller's
dictum, “is according to the taste and fancy of the speller.” Once
or twice MARI expresses herself awkwardly, as when she writes, “the
cry which the child uttered as he raised it reached the until then deaf
ears of the mother.”
when at what appears to be the penultimate moment of their
existence, Patricia exclaims ecstatically, “Death hath enfranchised
us, you and I,” the heroine, at so critical a moment, may be par-
Lovers are regardless of grammar; so
doned, for chucking grammar to the dogs. But “Genius is above
rules,” and if the book serves the purpose of amusement, and of
instruction, during a leisure hour, that is sufficient. “Tolle, lege”
by all means.
In the Unpublished Letters of Dean Swift, edited by Dr. BIRK-
BEck HILL (T. Fisher UN win), those who delight in the mordant
humour of one of the greatest of English letter-writers will find a
rich feast. For seventeen years, Swift poured out to his friend
KNIGHTLEY CHETwope, an Irish squire, the rich stores of his
knowledge of human nature, his wit, and, it must be added, his
querulousness and savage malignity. The death of Queen ANNE
had left him a broken, bitter man, bewailing in many keys the
mutability of human affairs, the inconstancy, ingratitude, and
forgetfulness of men of whom he thought himself to have deserved
well. The style of these letters is strong, simple and direct—that
is to say, it is Swift's. Not one of them has been published
before, for John ForsTER, who had intended to use them, died
before he could carry out his purpose, and former editors and
biographers of Swift were in ignorance of their existence. Dr.
BIRKBEck HILL's notes are excellent reading, full of delightful
incident of the time and of anecdotes about Swift, bits of his
conversation and apt extracts from his other writings. Buy the
book and read for yourself, says the Baron's Assistant.
“When previous engagements keep me from the seat of war,”
says my nautical Baronite, “I like to participate in the usual
dangers through the person of some proxy of .. right sort. In
the case of the late fracas between Spain and the States my good
friend, Mr. John BLAck Atkins, of the Manchester Guardian, and
late of Pembroke College, Cambridge, has very kindly supplied me
with vivid experiences collected from the front. His letters, put
together in The War in Cuba (SMITH, ELDER) are just as good
reading as a man can wish. He pretends, “to supplement rather
than to convey news of the war'; but I am bound to say that if any
single individual could have “conveyed' more, he must have had
better transport than the States Army ever got out of the War
Department. And it is all done with that intimate observation of
character and behaviour and minute detail, which is far more
convincing and realisable than the cut-and-dried record of march-
ing and counter-marching. Scarcely any episode, if we except the
battle of San Juan, is given without first-hand knowledge; and,
not being a bird, he eould not arrange to assist both at this fight
and also at the contemporaneous assault on Caney. His story is
personal, as it should be; but without the egoism which often
characterises such work. As for his style, always gay and buoyant,
it yet has those sympathetic qualities in which tears and laughter
are found not far apart. Add to this the charm of a literary manner
unstudied, and a happy resourcefulness of illustration drawn not
only from earlier experiences as a war-correspondent but from the
storehouse of a scholar's mind. Mr. AtKINs, though your name
may not be Thomas, “here's my best respects to you!”

querulousness and savage malignity. The death of Queen ANNE
had left him a broken, bitter man, bewailing in many keys the
mutability of human affairs, the inconstancy, ingratitude, and
forgetfulness of men of whom he thought himself §. deserved
well. The style of these letters is strong, simple and direct—that
is to º it is Swift's. Not one of them has been published
before, for John ForstER, who had intended to use them, died
before he could carry out his purpose, and former editors and
biographers of Swift were in ignorance of their existence. Dr.
BIRKBEck HILL's notes are excellent reading, full of delightful
incident of the time and of anecdotes about Swift, bits of his
conversation and apt extracts from his other writings. Buy the
book and read for yourself, says the Baron's Assistant.
“When previous engagements keep me from the seat of war,”
says my nautical Baronite, “I like to participate in the usual
dangers through the person of some proxy of the right sort. In
the case of the late fracas between Spain and the States my good
i friend, Mr. John BLAck ATKINs, of the Manchester Guardian, and
late of Pembroke College, Cambridge, has very kindly supplied me
with vivid experiences collected from the front. His letters, put
together in The War in Cuba (SMITH, ELDER) are just as good
reading as a man can wish. He pretends, “to supplement rather
than to convey news of the war'; but I am bound to say that if any
single individual could have “conveyed' more, he must have had
better transport than the States Army ever got out of the War
Department. And it is all done with that intimate observation of
| character and behaviour and minute detail, which is far more
| convincing and realisable than the cut-and-dried record of march-
ing and counter-marching. Scarcely any episode, if we except the
battle of San Juan, is given without first-hand knowledge; and,
not being a bird, he ºil not arrange to assist both at this fight
and also at the contemporaneous assault on Caney. His story is
personal, as it should be; but without the egoism which often
characterises such work. As for his style, always gay and buoyant,
it yet has those sympathetic qualities in which tears and laughter
are found not far apart. Add to this the charm of a literary manner
unstudied, and a happy resourcefulness of illustration drawn not
only from earlier experiences as a war-correspondent but from the
storehouse of a scholar's mind. Mr. Atkins, though your name
may not be THoMAs, “here's my best respects to you!'”

Question. I presume you are a patriot,
and consequently a good citizen?
Answer. That is my boast, and also my
conscientious belief.
Q. And you are aware that a patriotic
and good citizen should do all in his power
for his country's welfare?
A. No doubt, inclusive of the compiler
and collector of the revenue.
Q. Refusing to receive that reply on the
score of its frivolity, I would ask if you
do not admit the necessity of the payment
of taxes 2
A. Certainly; especially by persons other
than myself. -
Q. Why do you consider that you should
be exempt from the payment of taxes 2
A. To be in the fashion, it is the universal
personal opinion of all my countrymen.
Q. But cannot you point out one impost
that is more unpopular than any other?
A. Probably the Income Tax is the most
unpopular of all sources of revenue, as it
affects the largest number of taxpayers.
Q. What is your objection to this impost?
A. It is inquisitorial, in its manner of
being assessed and collected, and was in-
Q. What would surprise you more than
its continuance 2
A. Its abolition.
Q. Can you suggest any fresh impost to
meet the impending deficit 2
A. Very easily. I would propose a heavy
tax upon tobacco.
Q. Why would you select that material to
be mulcted?
A. Because I do not smoke and have no
shares in cigar companies.
Q. Then your opinion is only worth that
of a member of a not very large class 2 -
A. That is so, and possibly total abstainers
would suggest a tax upon alcohol, vege-
tarians a heavy fine on animal food, and
lº. of sixty a largely augmented
charge for marriage licences.
Q. But still you believe that it is necessary
to spend one hundred and ten millions on
the necessities of the Empire?
A. Yes, and my conviction is shared by
the entire nation.
Q. And how would you raise the money?
A. That is purely a matter for the decision
of the rt. hon. gentleman responsible for the
concoction of the Budget.
Q. And what will be meted out to him
whatever may be the nature of his financial
statement?
A. From his political friends luke-warm
the fiercest and most vindictive opposition,
condemnation, and even personal abuse.

CELLoR of THE Exchequer:—“In conse-
quence of the total suppression of the Wine
and Intoxicating Liquor Trade, and the
extinction of public-houses, where beer and
spirits are retailed, I am compelled, in order
to maintain the revenue, to announce that
we propose to raise the tax on tea, coffee,
and cocoa to half-a-crown per pound, while
all so-called mineral waters, such as soda,
seltzer, potash, and lithia, will bear an impost
of sixpence on each bottle. The duty on
lemonade, ginger-beer, and ginger-ale, how-
ever, will, #. happy to state, be only half
that amount. It is with great satisfaction
that I am able to announce that the present
duties on milk and potable water will not
be raised.” (Loud cheers from the Treasury

THE CREWS AT PUTNEY.
[Having in the interest of sport sent a competent
representative to Putney to report the doings of
the rival Blues, we were somewhat surprised to
receive from him the following communication,
If we had not reason to place implicit confidence in
our representative's accuracy and good faith we
should have suspected him of having mixed up the
boat-race practice with a visit to BARNUM's and
a Freemasons' Dinner. But rowing technicalities
are notoriously obscure, and we have therefore
printed the account exactly as we received it.—ED.]
Putney, March 11th.
Over Night orders had been given that
the Cantabs were to embark precisely at
12 o'clock, and at this hour, amid the
trumpetings of the elephants and the com-
bined noise of the now thoroughly awakened
menagerie, the Skeleton Dude took his seat
in the new Sims boat, which was promptly
shoved off from the Leander hard. Scarcely
a breath of wind ruffled the surface of the
Worshipful Master's face, as after the usual
preliminaries he rose to propose a toast
which, to use his own expressive words. had
been suggested to him by the Bearded Lady
in the privacy of her boudoir. Gibbon.
who was keeping the stroke beautifully
long and cven, was now clocked to be rowing
exactly 34 to a bumper of champagne and
no heeltaps. This sentiment ovoked
thunders of applause, which was only
checked when our American guest met a
masty cross-wash at Hammersmith Bridge.
where he dropped to 30, which was main-
tained as far as Santiago, the Spanish Fleet
having been wiped off the water. The
prices are as usual, half price being extended
to children between four and ten years ºf
age, who are admitted to the Cambridge
Crew daily, either in the morning or the
afternoon.
Later on Oxford tried a few spurts, but
nothing of any importance was very trying
to the feelings of every loyal freemason,
who thus found himself compelled to stroke
a winning University for the fourth tiº;
notwithstanding which the dwarfs and
other living human prodigies were as
amusing as they always are to GoLDIE, the
§.i. No. 3, whose speech was voted
the success of the evening. Altogether this
entertainment may be pronounced one of
the most magnificent ever given between
Putney and Mortlake, the stroke being well
rowed out and the crew finishing with any
amount of milk punch specially provided
for this banquet by the orders of Mr.
FLETCHER, their coach, who is perhaps not
quite so large as the once celebrated Jumbo,
but is now certainly the largest African
elephant in the world. The health of the
secretary was then drunk with three times
three and musical honours, and the pro-
ceedings were continued till a late hour of
the night, when the Oxford crew were met
on their return journey from Mortlake.
ALMOST-" ALONE, HE DID IT!"
In a Society weekly it was stated in a
aragraph concerning musical news at a
ashionable resort, that a certain composer
“had the theatre pretty well to himself last
night, the programme being composed
entirely of works of his composition.” So
apparently the cninent one not only com-
posed the works performed, but also com-
posed the programme (marvellous effort of
genius!), and then, “had the theatre pretty
well to himself.” What an admirable

to understand that the choice of two alternatives only is open to
them, and that they must decide between giving up their present
untenable claims, or rendering themselves liable to the practical
and disastrous consequences which any further obstinacy on their
part will involve. That, we venture to think, is the whole gist of

When a man's engaged he doesn't go off to a desert island without
getting into a scrape of some sort.
Wheatley. Neopalia isn't a desertisland. I wish it was.
Dennis. It's hard luck on BEATRICE HIPGRAVE, I must say.
Wheatley. Do you suppose I enjoy it? These modern young
ladies are too much for me. How was I to know when I came to
Neopalia that a lady would propose to me before I'd been in the
island a week? And take no refusal, too ! Dash it, it's too bad.
Dennis. What does WATKINs think?
Wheatley (despondinglº). Uh, WATEINs has given warning. I
knew he would. He told me he could not remain in the service of
a nobleman who was engaged to two young ladies at once.
Ilennis. Bravo, WATKINs!
W heatley. Yes, I knew you wouldn't sympathise, with me. No-

CRYPTIC JOURNALISM.
A PROTEST.
DEAR MR. PUNCH.-May I ask you, as
Public Enlightener, if you can suggest any
valid reason why purchasers of certain
penny and even ..". weekly newspapers
should be tantalised by columns of dark and
apparently personal comments and queries?
I mean the sort of stuff that's headed (say)
“Ondits of the Week,” “Gossip by Our
Own Gad-about,” “Queer Queries,” and so
forth. To borrow the favourite epithet of
one of these periodicals, such oracular re-
marks run the risk of being considered
“unfunny” by the plain man in the street
or the club smoking-room, to whom they
º about as luminous as the “lights”
of an acrostic. Not being in the know, like,
I fancy, a good many others, I am more
exasperated by these enigmatic allusions
... than impressed by the writer's superior
knowledge of what goes on behind the
scenes. But perhaps, after all, they are
only a device to fill up space, and may
relate to imaginary, or, at least, very unin-
explanation's sake, turn out a few examples
of this kind of journalism :-Under the
heading of “Eavesdroppings,” for instance,
we overhear That a very pretty woman
was seen the other night at a West End
Restaurant.
That a smart young sprig of nobility was
in attendance.
That, as usual, Mr. HUSBAND was in the
wings of a theatre not a hundred miles from
Charing Cross.
That proceedings will ensue.
That we shall see what we shall see.
That it would be odd if we didn't.
That a certain financier has lately been
going the pace.
That Mrs. FINANCIER's diamonds are only
paste.
That the bailiffs are in.
That you never know.
That there will shortly be a wedding in
high life.
hat she would much rather have the
Guardsman.
That he never meant what he said.
That, as things are going, there will be a
pretty kettle of fish.
That suburban trains are dreadfully
crowded in the º,
That she sat on his knee coming home.
That they had changed hats.
That they do say she was only a governess.
That there has been high play lately at
Monte Carlo.
That certain banking accounts have been ||
overdrawn.
That blackmail has a very ugly sound.
That chestnuts are in season.
That QUEEN ANNE is dead.
And so on. We might reel off these
occult remarks by the yard, without any-
body beinfº the wiser, and so I remain
affled as ever, ZEDWHYEks.
A DILEMMA.
[“Herr Borked AL, an eminent Norwegian phy-
sicist, recently attempted to demonstrate that . . .
the great furnace of the universe is rapidly burn-
ing itself out, and unless it be very soon stoked up
from some unexpected quarter, our children, or at
furthest, our grandchildren, will witness its ex-
tinction.”—Daily Chronicle.]
OH, Sun, when frigid prophets paint
Your beams as growing still more faint,
Until all heat is lost,
We coolly wink the other eye
As evil thus they Fºl.
Convinced it is a “frost.”
Since of some former forecasts we
Retain a vivid memory,
And of our trepidation
When they presented to our view
The lurid prospects of a u-
-niversal conflagration.
Who then the question shall decide,
If frozen we must be—or fried
Some years (or aeons) hence?
'Twixt ice and fire still loth to choose
(Since either way we stand to lose),
We'll—split the difference.

writers, are considered to be suitable gifts for our

WITH growing suspicion TIMothy PRIg-
LET eyed the rakish-looking craft lying on
the horizon, and his fears increased when
the frigate Albatross (in which TIMothy was
serving as junior midshipman) altered her
course and gave chase to the stranger.
Without delay he sought out the captain,
who, recognising TIMothy's beautiful moral
character, was always delighted to receive
advice from him. Yes, said the captain,
there was no doubt about it--yonder craft
was manned by pirates!
“How terrible !” exclaimed TIMothy.
“Pirates, you know, are men whose princi-
ples are really quite dishonest. They have
no business to appear in a story of which I
am the hero. at do you propose to do?”
“To blow them to smithereens,” replied
the captain, promptly.
TIMoTHY . “Certainly not!”
he cried. “That would mean fighting, and
fighting is very wicked. Kindly lend me
your speaking-trumpet, and when, we get
nearer the pirate I will manage the business
for you.” -
e, captain obeyed rather sulkily: the
truth is, that he had been accustomed to
figure in stories of the bad old kind, and
tºº, enjoyed a fight.
By this time the two vessels were close to
each other, and TIMoTHY put the speaking-
trumpet to his mouth.
“Of course,” was the reply from the
commander of the other ship. “Don’t you
see my black flag 2 Or if that doesn't con-
vince you, # give a bloodthirsty yell.
There isn't a pirate afloat who can beat me
in that part of our business. And in a few
minutes your ship will be in flames, and
you will have to walk the plank l''
“Nonsense,” said TIMothy, “I’m the
hero. Heroes don't walk the plank.”
“Oh, I beg your pardon,” replied the
pirate. “Of course not. Didn't recognise
you at first. Of course, if you're the hero,
the fight will go the other way: For
several pages the air will be thick with
smoke, the masts will fly into splinters, and
the scuppers will run with blood. Then,
just when your captain loses all hope;
you'll lead a desperate boarding-party, and
ock us over with cutlasses and marlin-
spikes. We shall all be hung, and an hour
later the sullen waves will roll over the spot
where lately the Black Maria floated. Bless
you, I've been through the business in
dozens of books. Are your guns loaded
with grape? If so, we may as well begin.”
“Stop 1" commanded TIMothy. “No-
thing so horrible is going to be allowed in
this story. Have you considered what the
effect would be upon our readers? Do you
know that a leading daily paper declares that
its influence might be extremely harmful ?”
“No,” said the pirate, with some sur-
prise, “I haven't seen the papers for some
time. So that's the latest idea, is it?
Well, I've never had any fault found with
me before in all the years I’ve been at the
business. Isn't there to be any description
of our fight?”
“There's to be no fight to describe,”
TIMothy explained. “To read accounts of
cordance with the principles of modern en-
lightenment, we will submit our respective
claims to arbitration. Will you kindly row
across to this ship for the purpose ?”
Tears of remorse furrowed the pirate's
weatherbeaten cheek as he stepped meekly
into his boat. “Many a year ſº been at
it,” he murmured. “Seen service, I have,
with a score of writers . . . . and after all,
I'm nought but a harmful influence. Well,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRActed FRom THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 6.-
Don't hear much of Private HANBURY since
he got his stripes and ranks as Corporal.
Time was when, in company with ToMMY
Bowles and that other young roysterer, the
Blameless BARTLEy, he used to hear the
chimes at midnight and after. Now he sits
in silent majesty at end of Treasury Bench.
Sometimes a frown clouds his massive brow
as he wonders how Tom My can prattle so
about the Votes. Occasionally he turns and
stares at the Blameless One, when he wants
to know about those Old Age Pensions.
Certainly it was a mistake to omit B. B.
from the list of guests invited to the State
Concert, or was it a State Ball? Now
omission corrected, what more can a man
want? Corporal HANBURY can't understand
the spirit of indiscipline that leads these
private members, whether above or below
the Gangway, to haggle with Finance Secre-
taries about twopence halfpenny in the
Votes, still less to presume to dictate to the
Leader of the House in what order he shall
present Ministerial business.
To-night the Corporal broke his long
silence: showed that his keen eye for a job,
his mastery of facts and figures, his gift of
lucid statement, which distinguished him
when a private member and paved his way
to the Treasury Bench, remain in full
force. His º Bill a thorough busi-
mess measure; his exposition a model of
clearness. Only once did he venture to
scatter a posy on the mound of matter-of-
fact statement. That happened when in-
º by reference to the personality of
that friend of man, JAMEs STAATs Forbes.
J. S. F., amongst other minor matters, is
Chairman of the National Telephone
Company. As such he conducted the
earlier negotiations with the Post-Office.
Worsted before the Select Committee on a
particular point, or as nearly worsted as he
ever is in that arena. JAMEs STAATs meekly
retired with the remark, “The moral law is
enough for me.”
“It is only fair to say, with regard to
Mr. Forbes,” said Corporal HANBURY,
* The SIMPLE Shepherd.”

“ that his voice is always the voice of a very
simple person indeed, almost like the simple
shepherd in Arcady, but the hands are the
hands of a very able Chairman of a Com-
pany in the City.”
A pretty idea that, bringing to the mind,
as in a flash of sunlight on the camera, the
bland smile, the kindly regard, the face
almost boyish in its innocence, of the famous
chairman. -
SARK says he believes that JAMES STAATs,
though of course he did not actually sit as
the model for Joshua REYNoLDs's “Angels'
Heads,” was in the painter's mind when he
sketched that immortal picture. I point
out that 's impossible. Picture painted
more than a hundred years ago ; JAMEs
STAATs doesn't look more than fifty.
-- May be,” says SARK, in the tone of the
unconvinced; “but in the ways of the
world he's more than a hundred. Besides,
ou will admit that HANBURY is quite right
in his leading idea. A face like that wants
the cherub's wings painted in ; lacking them,
there is a sense of incompleteness.”
Business done.-Telephone Bill brought in.
Tuesday.-Nothing more pleasant than
the personal good feeling and good temper
that underlie political warfare in Parliament.
Two members who have been violently
attacking each other across floor of House
between six and seven in the evening two
hours later may be found sitting in friendly
converse at the same dinner-table.
Illustration of this state of things forth-
coming to-night. Ministerial Whip nomi-
nated five members to sit on Joint Committee
with Lords to enquire into position of staff of
officers in both Houses of Parliament. No
Irish member on the list. Irish members
protest, not so much because of slight to
their country or of personal desire to sit on
Committee. It is all on account of the
MARKiss. He, they say, in tremulous tones,
doesn't personally know an Irish member.
Now here 's a chance. Put on Committee,
of which the MARKiss will be Chairman,
MARKiss will realise what he has lost
through long, years of, perhaps uninten-
tional, certainly effective, isolation.
The MARKiss, of course, not here to
speak for himself. If he were, easy to guess
what he would say at prospect thus opened
up. In his absence his colleagues don't
like to take on themselves authority; so
golden opportunity glides on and is lost,
possibly for evermore.
Business done. — LLoyd GEoRGE moves
resolution declaring that system of primary
education in England º Wales demands
immediate attention of Parliament. By
majority of 204 against 81 House thinks not.

MICHAEL, sitting lower down the bench,
wondering where in the name of All Angels
it's ſº to end. St. Michael thinks
bitterly of the £1,700,000 a year allotted the
other day out of the taxes to the British
landlord; of the £300,000 a year provided
under the lirish local Government Act for
Irish landowners; of the £600,000 a year
contributed to the funds of church schools.
How far off seems the time when such
things were possible, and yet how near !
Not so near as Budget Night, when St.
Michael will have to face use music, with
the notes of income very low, and the notes
of expenditure exceedingly high.
“A weary world, my Toby,” he mur-
mured. “I begin to lose all hope in man.

Business done.—JokIM introduces Navy
Estimates for coming year. A little bill of
£26,594,500, being an increase of £2,816,000
on the unprecedented expenditure of last

y Friday.-Never saw House so surprised
as when KILBRIDE was discoursing on Food
and Drugs Bill. Measure includes provision
legalising, under certain conditions, sale of
margarine. This opposed in interest of
British butter. RILBRIDE, himself a tenant-
farmer, whose proud boast is that he was
the first man evicted in Plan of Campaign,
defended Margarine Clause. -
“The fact is, Mr. SPEAKER,” he said, with
confidential nod towards the Chair, “75
per cent. of the margarine coming to this
country is used for cooking porpoises.”
House plainly . Obviously, if
porpoises were being prepared for the table,
stewing in butter, or its substitute, would
be a desirable process. But no one remem-
bered observing the dish on a bill of fare.
Berhaps KILBRIDE was alluding to some
West of Ireland custom. Only the other
night LEcky discovered that distress in
those parts is due directly to the Atlantic
Ocean. The Atlantic has its compensations
as well as its disappointments. Possibly at
high tide it deposits on the beach the play-
ful porpoise, which is straightway carried off
to the nearest cabin, cunningly treated with
margarine, and dished with the mealy potato.
Then there flashed on puzzled members
the solution of the mystery. What KIL-
BRIDE meant was “cooking purposes.” The
homely word declaimed in fine North Gal-
way accent becomes the sportive fish.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A. Diplomatist's Wife in Japan (HUTCHINson) has made the
world brighter by sending from home to home, as she prettily
puts it, a batch of chatty letters. Nothing better illustrating
social life in Japan is known to my Baronite, who happens to
be familiar with #. people and the places, and is interested to learn
that the old P. & O. Steamer Verona, in which fifteen years ago he
also steamed through the Inland Sea, is yet at her post. Mrs.
FRASER has been fortunate in enlivening her own sparkling style
with the reproduction of some 250 sketches, many by Japanese
artists. There are some delightful little things by Kyos A1, which
in their humour, vividness, and power of producing effect by the
fewest strokes, are singularly like the work of one of Mr. Punch's
young men. if our dear Fan May had been born a two-sworded
man—which Heaven forbade—he would have done work exactly
like these gems by the great Japanese artist. What with the
pictures ºf the literary style of the letters we have here wafted
across the seas, not only scenes from life in Japan, but the very
atmosphere in which they move. The publishers turn out the
two handsome volumes in a style worthy their contents.
The latest volume of The Liberal Magazine (42, Parliament
Street) is what it modestly claims to be, a political record for the
year 1898. It is more than that. It is a storehouse of facts and
igures bearing upon the questions of the day, indispensable to all
who deal with public affairs. It is avowedly designed for the use
of Liberal speakers and for those who go down to the country in
trains to further the Liberal cause at by-elections. My Baronite,
looking through its pages, teeming with pointed extracts, from
F. speeches delivered in both political camps, believes it to be not
ess precious to the Unionist seeker after truth and timely illus-
tration of his argument. It also, and this not the least service,
teaches him what topics to avoid. A marvel and a model
of the boiling down of the political chatter of the year. Nothing
important seems to be left out. Yet, including a record and diary
of political events, all is compact within 580 pages. Wherein lurks
a moral for hon. and º: hon. gentlemen who think it impossible,
being on their º: to deliver their ..f. within the space of an
hour. A full index crowns an edifice of rarely good design and
workmanship.
There can be no better device for popularising SHAKsPEARE,
especially among the educated classes, who talk so much yet
know so little of the “Divine, WILLIAM,” than that of issuing
his plays and poems in small-pocketable and, therefore, conveniently
§: volumes, so clearly printed as to offer the least possible
difficulty to almost any sight, with or without glasses. The travel-
§." will admit that in The Temple Edition of Shakspeare
(published by DENT & Co., of Aldine #. with its historical
and literary prefaces, its instructive notes and useful glossary, he
has, at a merely trifling cost, the means ready to hand of insuring
to himself for every journey the best companionship in the world.
uoth the Baron—“Read One of the Grenvilles, a novel writ by
S. R. LYsAGHT, and published by Messrs. MacMILLAN & Co. in one
volume.". His characters, and his brief analºsis of them indi-
vidually in various phases of their career, are as amusing as his
story is interesting. His two principal male characters do not
deserve to be enrolled in fiction as “heroes,” nor has either of
his “heroines” any right to a rank superior to that of ordinary
girls more or less in love. But it is to #. touching story of Mab
and her besotted father, the character of the philosophic Roger,
with his love of †. life, and his perfect contentment with
his freedom as a bachelor, and, above all, to the scenes on board
The Pegasus, with its delightful group of characters, the old
'Admiral and his staunch friends, the swivel-eyed lieutenant,
Nance, his niece, and the obstinate old Colonel, that this novel
must owe its }. success and its permanent place as “one
of the best.” The chapter in which the warm-hearted old Captains
| last cruise is described, approaches that masterpiece of simple
pathos, the death of Colonel Newcome.
Whilst others root out poor Louis STEvenson's waste-paper
basket, and publish unconsidered trifles, unfinished stories, or—
according to my Baronite's prejudice—worse still, yoke him in
labour with persons who have no claim to the distinction save the
incongruous one of marriage connections, Messrs. CHATTo AND
WINDUs go back to some of his earliest and best works,
reproducing them in handy and cheap form. Of these are An
Inland Voyage and Travels with a Donkey, books which started an
unknown young man on the path of fame. There is nothing new
to be said in the way of comment about these old familiar friends.
Those who have read the books before will read them again in
their new attire. Those who have never read them have joy at hand.
The Cardinal's Page (CHAPMAN AND HALL), by JAMEs BAKER.
Ahem “Not to-day, BAKER,” It is a romance, tempo 1415,
dated within the first half of the fifteenth century; consequentl
strange mediaeval language must ba looked for, and, when i.
made a note of. Of such there be, in this book, many queer
examples, among which will be found the word “squash " : not,
however, in connection with the modern beverage concocted of
lemon and ice imbibed per a straw, but as expressive of the conse-
quence to a falling human body precipitated through space down-
wards into a charnel pit. Pleasant, very. But this is only an
incidental horror just to whet the appetite: and at those who
love to sup, dine, lunch, or even breakfast on such “raw material,”
the Baron winks his other eye, and says, “there 's more where
that comes from.” The story begins well, and during the earlier
chapters the interest of the story is sustained; but anon 'tis lost
in the hurly-burly of , fighting, shouting, butchering, banging,
catapulting, bowing-and-arrowing, clanging, slashing, imprison-
ing, escaping, re-capturing, releasing, and da capo with con-
fusing, variations through which the crafty Skipper will dodge
his wily way, endeavouring amid crowds of bewildering pages
to discover what will ultimately become of the Cardinal's page,
and what on earth has become of the Cardinal himself who plays
hide-and-seek throughout the volume. THE B. DE B.-W.

had a long interview with the Russian Ambassador, and arranged
for the partition of China, the annexation of Egypt, and the esta-

Sir Geoffrey. Look here, CLoRINDA. Do you want to marry Sir

Clo. Rather l I should think I did.
Sir Geoffrey. Then I'll give you a piece of advice. Give up
rational dress and boxing-matches, and all that kind of thing. No
man will marry a girl who knocks him out at the end of the third
round. It isn't likely.
Clo. Jove, I believe you're right. Farewell, rational dress,
I'm afraid I shall have to give you up. Thanks for the hint, Dad.
I'll go upstairs and put on skirts.
ACT II.-Scene—The Rose Garden. A sun-dial in the centre of
the stage. Enter Clo, gorgeously attired in skirts.
Clo. Will he come 2 I wonder. I believe Papa was right, and
breeches are a mistake—for me, I mean. JACK and I haven't seen
so much of each other lately, and I can't say I have ever detected

[Enter furtively, Sir John Oxon. On seeing CLo, he attempts to
go out again, but his courage fails him, and he advances
sheepishly.
Oron. Is that you, CLo?
Clo. Of course it is. You know we always used to meet here by
the sun-dial.
Ozon (aside). Worse luck.
Clo (aside). He doesn't seem very glad to see me.
Ozon. It's a fine day.
Clo. Ripping !

Keep your temper, CLo, or I shall go away.

ball in º; but the guests are all in another room. Enter
cautiously Sir John Oxon.
Ozon. Safe at last. Nobody here. Clo has been following me

By Jove! here she comes. If she finds me here she'll murder me.

of OsmonDE.
Osmonde. At length we are alone. Miss WILDAIRs, I have some-
thing particular to ask you.
Clo. What is it, Duke 2
Osmonde. Ever since I saw you in the hunting field, when you
wore rational dress, and rode over the hounds, I have passionately
admired you. . Will you be my wife?
Clo (aside). A proposal at last, and from a Duke too. (Aloud,
coyly.) This is very sudden, Duke.
Osmonde. Ah, I have been too rash, too presumptuous. I will
go away. . . . [Going.
Clo (hastily, grasping him by the coat-tails). No, you don't,
Duke. I am yours.
Osmonde (kissing her rapturously). My darling !
[While they embrace, Sir John Oxon emerges cautiously from
wnder the sofa.
Clo. Who's that
Ozon. It is I, Sir John Oxon. I thought it would be safe to
face you now.
Osmonde. Safe 2
Ozon. Yes. She proposed to me this morning, and when I
refused her she wanted to knock me down, but as she's accepted
you now, I suppose she won't want me any more.
Clo (seizing him by the collar). Now I've got you. (Shakes him
violently.) Leave us, Duke. This gentleman and I have some-
thing to say to one another. [Erit Duke.
Ozon (whimpering). I say, shut up, CLo. You're throttling me.
Clo. I'll do worse than throttle you.
[Sitting down on sofa, and grasping a slender riding whip.
Ozon (in horror). CLo! What are you going to do?
Clo (grimly). You'll see. (Turms him over her knee and proceeds
to whip him soundly.) I'll teach you to tell people I proposed to you.

THE EIGHTS AT PUTNEY.
FLING out the flags at Putney, the hour is drawing near,
The hour beyond all other hours the greatest of the year,
When with a swish and rattle, and straining side by side,
Loosed from the leash the ships leap past on Father Thames's tide.
The morning fogs at Putney are bitter in the mouth,
And bitter when the night draws on the weary oarsman's drouth;
And, oh, the chill nor’-easters they lash you like a whip,
When doggedly you drive the boat from Putney to the “Ship.”
But wearily or cheerily the day's work must be done,
Or blanketed by clinging mists, or smiled on by the sun;
And, though the blast beat fiercely and white-caps break in foam,
Swing out and, oh, swing back to it, and sweep the finish home.
Now feet upon the stretchers and balance as you swing,
And reach, reach, reach, my merry men, and take it with a spring:
Your hearts may thump, your muscles ache, your breath come
short and fast,
Yet keep it long and row it strong, and hold it to the last.

MUSIC.—Sir ALEXANDER MACKENzIE, whom we congratulate on
getting over the “influenzie,” is coming out strong at the Philhar-
monic with his piano-fortissimo players. There's M. SAPELLNIkoff,
difficult to write, still more to pronounce correctly; Mr. L. Bor-
wick, with all the powder so associated with the name; and the cele-
brated Irishman from the fair land of Poland, yelept PADDY REwski.
There's a Russian Composer, whose name we cannot either write
or pronounce, but he's on the list (and other pianists are on the
Liszt too, with variations), and he ends in “off.” Plenty of
variety, so that the music-loving public may go there and get its
“Phil.” May a full Phil be rewarded by promises fully fulfilled.

We welcome you to London as the latest Road of Iron—
To Marylebone your terminus has found its way at length;
Here's greeting from the Johnian glades that classic “Lord's"

And may your way be . your good luck be the same !

And boom initials which denote a really first-class name.
But why “Hotel Great Central”? Do we talk of Temple Middle,

Why Gallic ways of naming are in fashion is a riddle—

AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL

hopes thus to reconstruct a tolerably correct type of

PEASANT of many years ago,
To olden times attention giving,
Science is curious to know
What you were like when you were living.
Your skull we therefore dig from where
A rude posterity had chucked it;
And then proceed with patient care
And artful skill to reconstruct it.
Fresh layers of tissue we impose,
Of skin we spread another suit on,

In Betty Musgrave (METHUEN), the authoress of her being, MARY
FINDLATER, gives us the story of a brave girl endowed with
considerable !". charms, whose strong sense of duty i.
her tied and bound to her wretched mother, an incurable
inebriate, by whom she is dragged down into the gutter, or un-
pleasantly, close to it, and forced to live in the very queerest
“lower-middle class” society, of which some representative speci-
mens are gathered together in a § suburban boarding-house
kept by a sharp, keen-eyed, but kind-hearted matron, compared
with whom and with whose establishment, Mrs. Todgers was
socially a º person and her house almost aristocratic. The
characters of the boarders are cleverly sketched; and particularly
life-like is that of the brusque but kindly lady-artist, sculptor, and
painter, a woman “with a º but with an improving present,
and the prospect of a better future, who gives the heroine temporary
assistance. The only mistake in the book is the incidental villain,
of the “genteelest" of exteriors, as if he had stepped into the
novel out of quite modern Adelphi melodrama. Of course he is
invariably “foiled,” and severely thrashed, as such villains always
should be in real life, and always are in drama, unless their
unishment is placed in the hands of the police. As for the
ero, he is a poor “pitiful sort of cuss,” as not a few heroes pos-
sibly may be when one gets on intimate terms with them, and
when we come to “know them at home,” as is easily done in a
novel. However, the virtuous heroine ultimately bestows on him
her hand, much to the Baron's regret. May she be happy!
A Duet with an occasional Chorus (GRANT RICHARDs), ; A. CoNAN
Doyle, is a most delightful book, beginning with a courtship, and
ending, at the expiration of the first year of the very happy couple's
married life, with the advent of a most heartily welcome ſittle
stranger. It is perfect comedy, with just, as it were, a growl of
distant thunder presaging a storm that darkens the sky for
a while, passes away, and then the sun shines on them more
brightly than ever. The somewhat slangy, go-as-you-please,

written is, to the Baron's thinking, the very perfection of literary

BoEN at Brooklyn, U.S.A., and cut out, by family tradition, for
the Dissenting Ministry, it was my earliest ambition to be a Man

Turkey, or some other distressed nationality, not my own. Ex-
perience has since taught me (and some of my own party) that the
tongue may be a sharper weapon than the sword. Still, to have
occupied no deadlier post of danger than that of Civil Lord of the
Admiralty—how cruel a contrast to my youthful yearning for gore.
Stay! I forgot the “Battlefields of Thessaly.” Surely there, but
for a stupid capture, I came near to my baptism of fire. And,
indeed, to this day I keep my early instinct for the letting out of

that the post in question was at the moment occupied, and not
likely, for some time, to be at my disposal. “No matter,” I
replied, “I will spend the interim in completing my culture at
Eton, Oxford, and the Pamirs. For form's sake, I will enter the
House, and keep my hand in by filling a few of the junior Offices
of State. If the hour is still not ripe, I may kill time by being a
Viceroy or something of that kind.” I ought to say that, at this

they would say. As yet without other ambition than to tickle
these simple minds that “joke wi' deeficulty,” I had not then
foreseen that this very gift would eventually raise me to the head

I was the guest of their unique Club, almost the highest honour

THE INVASION OF ENGLAND.
(A Page of Future History.)
MANY years ago a writer in the Revue des Deua Mondes, of
March 15, 1899, proposed an infallible scheme for the invasion of
England. 1,500 boats, like river barges, driven by steam, could
quickly cross the channel, and, being run ashore high and dry,
could land in a few minutes an army of 170,000 men on the
defenceless southern coast. The writer suggested that the landin
should take place at an unexpected point, but he partly reveale
this destination by saying, in reference to the sea-passage, “en
admettant qu'om choisisse Brighton, sept heures suffiraient largement.”
Of course the 170,000 warriors, after seven hours on the sea, would
be glad to arrive at a large town, destitute of cafés no doubt, but
consisting almost entirely of hotels and lodging-houses, where rest
and recovery would be possible. The following account of the
invasion is translated from the narrative of a French officer.
When war broke out, the 1,500 boats were assembled at Calais
and Boulogne. After various delays every preparation was
completed on a certain Sunday—it was Whit Sunday—and at
midnight our flotilla started. It was the Invincible Armada of
the twentieth century. At the moment of departure its destination
was announced, and from 170,000 valiant Frenchmen there rose a
mighty shout, “d Briguetonne / "
Although adverse winds and a rough sea delayed our progress,
the flotilla passed Newhaven at half-past ten on Monday morning.
We had seen nothing of the English fleet. The profound secrecy
of our preparations had deceived the enemy. It was evident that
we should land without difficulty.
As we approached Brighton all our telescopes were directed
towards the shore, and a universal cry of surprise rose from those
of our soldiers who were not entirely prostrated by sea-sickness.
Those who were could only murmur feebly, “Nous arrivons 2 Mon
Dieu, quel voyage t . Çata finir bientôt,”. The others, they were
but few, beheld the English shore black with troops. Treachery,
ever with us, and tem #. by the gold of despicable England, had

169,750 valiant, but feeble Frenchmen, there comes a cry of
anguish and horror, “Encore dia: heures en mer? Jamais ! Plutót

the rage and indignation of a disappointed country, around us are
our compatriots, prepared to die, prepared almost to mutiny if
they had the strength, but not prepared to suffer yet another ten
hours on the seal Before us is the English army, contemptible
yet numerous. Even bravest of soldiers cannot achieve the impos-
sible. The invincible flotilla stops, turns, and slowly retires.
One submarine boat alone continues its onward course. Not
mutiny, not disobedience causes this, but some defect in the
steering apparatus, which has become immoveable. Onwards to

edge of the water, six stout English policemen, who arrest our
brave compatriots as they land. -
Too late the horrible error was explained. It was an English
holiday, and all the travellers of the excursion trains were amusing

terrible voyage, had fled before a crowd of unarmed civilians and

CUCKOO NOTES IN THE AVENUE.
MR. CHARLEs, HAwTREY, as Hugh Farrant in The Cuckoo, has
added another character-portrait to his gallery of amusing liars.
His quiet manner, with very occasional and only momentary out-
bursts of spasmodic love-making, is simply perfect. His chuckling
enjoyment of his own utter absence of moral principle is intensely
amusing. Whatever he has done, even the sternest juryman in
the audience finds him “not guilty,” adding pleasantly, “and
mind you don't do it again,”, yet earnestly ho ;" as soon as
ossible the said strict moralist may be a ; ted witness of
HARLEs HAwTREY's most ingenious method of getting into, and
out of, decidedly tight corners. He belongs to the stage of the
time of the second CHARLEs, when the actors were looked upon
not as those who had a moral to inculcate dramatically, but
simply as irresponsible puppets, placed by the author of their
being in possible, and not absolutely improbable, predicaments.
They adorned dramatic tales, and pointed no moral: except in a
negative sort of way.
Mr. BRookFIELD (author and character actor) has made not only
a very amusing adaptation of MEILHAc's indecorous and ingenious
Décore, but has had the somewhat rare good fortune of having
his “comedy-farce” most efficiently “cast.”
It might be wished that º Miss FANNIE WARD (is this
young lady Américaine 3), as Mrs. Penfold, were a trifle more dis-
tinct in her rapid utterance, and also that she would emphasise the
lights and shades of the character with an occasional exhibition
of dignified repose; as it is, she is all flutter, like a pretty pet bird
in a cage, suddenly startled.
Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMs is delightful as the commonplace corn-
and away, on whose conceit the demi-mondaine, Lady Alexandra
Park (played with a delicious sense of humour and without any
exaggeration whatever by Miss CoNSTANCE Collier), draws to the
extent of two hundred pounds, which is the sum the amorous
corn-broker has to pay for his moral lesson.
A philosophic treatise might be written on the place in creation
of Colefar, the utterly absurd and thoroughly scoundrelly waiter;
but to imagine that he, with such a j on the reputation of a
lady and a gentleman as he possesses, could be bought off for five
pounds, is just, the one and only mistake in what has been, up to
this point, in the third act, a most carefully and ingeniously con-
structed plot.
A good word for the black king Kamswaga .. CoRYToN), but
especially for his interpreter, convincingly played by Mr. H.
STEPHENson, whose make up is as admirable as is his patronising
manner".
Mr. FRED VoIPé represents that highly respectable bourgeois,
the Mayor of Maidensbourne, apparently some relation to Sir
Edward CLARKE, Q.C., M.P., and Mr. JustiN MºCARTHY, to both
of whom he bears a striking, yet puzzling, resemblance.
| Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY seems to have got a success that ought,
ºthere's any “luck about the house,” to run right away through
the Season.
CAMBRIDGE WINS
A BUMPER to Cambridge! Great Zeus, how it stirs us
To see the light blue floating first o'er the line !
Fate smiles once again and no longer defers us;
One year makes amends for the losses of nine.

He was stalwart and sturdy and steady and strong;
And behind him swung Goldie, a treat and a treasure,
A chip of the old block who kept the stroke long.
At two was young CALVERT, the Antipodean;
From bow little CHAPMAN the prospect enjoyed:
And, since Eights must be steered, just to wind up my paean,
I may add that their coxswain, a ripper, was Lloyd.

Business done.-Second reading of London
Government Bill moved.
Thursday.—“A Blondel ! A Blondel !”
The battle cry first heard on the Plains of
Palestine rang through the startled House
to-night. Stout SALADIN, who often heard
it in crusading days, has left on record the
confession that it was “the only thing of
the kind that really made his flesh creep.”
The spell has not lapsed in the slow move-
ment of centuries. To-night, when Sir
MAPLE BLoNDEL-BLoNDEL of Blondel (in
the county of Middlesex) takes down the
banner that for a thousand years has floated
over the battlements of Tottenham Grange,
and waves it, so to speak, in the teeth of
the Treasury Bench, PRINCE ARTHUR, albeit
buttressed on either side by the SoLIcitor-
GENERAL and the PRESIDENT of THE BoARD
of TRADE, visibly pales.
It is the old story, older than the
Crusades. Cherchez la femme. Sir BLoNDEL
cherche, but cannot find her in the folds of
the London Government Bill.
“What about the ladies?” he asks. “Can
they be aldermen 2 Can they be mayors?”
Here Sir BLonDEL condescended to intro-
duce a joke that has been in the family for
three centuries. “Women,” he said, “are,
I know, sometimes spoken of as Mares. As
CHAUCER hath it ‘the grey mare is the
better horse.' But what I am enquiring
about is M-A-Y-O-R-S.”
The Knights in the immediate neighbour-
hood of Sir BLoNDEL laughed immoderately.

fist at the Treasury Bench, Sir BLoNDEL
insisted on speedy answer to his challenge.

and Sir Knight, º pleased to be

Business done.—Further debate on London
Government Bill.
Friday.—Still debating second reading of
London Government Bill. The further we
go into the matter, the more abundant the
objections. PRINCE ARTHUR is becoming
amazed at his own immoderation of error,
alarmed at his |º of incapacity.
Comforts himself with reflection that if,
when the scheme for the creation of the
world was introduced, Mr. Lough and Dr.
CLARK had chanced to be about, they would
have moved a series of amendments.
“Odd thing when you come to think of
it,” PRINCE ARTHUR muses, “significant,
too, that the first person instrumental in
carrying an adjournment on what he re-
garded as a matter of urgent public import-
ance, was the Serpent in the Garden of

WELCoME, wintry Easter,
Shame it is to see
Odes and songs to Christmas,
Ne'er a verse to thee.
Welcome, bitter Easter,
Cut the early rose,
Freeze the nesting black-bird,
Nip the unguarded nose.
' Tired we were of summer,
Voted zephyrs queer,
When the storms of Winter
Ought to have been here. .
Easter, send us blizzards,
Frosts exceeding great,
Make amends for Christmas,
Turn us out to skate 1
+. - - -
Welcome, sunny Easter,
Mayst thou with thee bring
All the warmth of Summer
All the youth of Spring l
Welcome, balmy Easter,
Make the blossom blow,
Give the keen manoeuvring
Volunteer a show.
Come with soft South-wester
Breathing mild and kind,
Kill the influenza,
Knock the microbe blind.
Easter, send us sunshine,
Sunshine every day,
Cricket, golf, and tennis,
Turn us out to play !
- - - -
Thus the bard greets Easter
With a double voice,
Gents, you pays your money,
Gents, you takes your choice;
For the good old weather,
Cold or hot, allow—
With the bard bid Easter
Welcome—anyhow !

Is it correct to describe a pair of old-
fashioned spectacles as “ancient lights”?
Should an action on a “bill of sale” be
brought in the Admiralty Court 2
Is the acceptance of an invitation by letter
a “promissory note” 2
Are pipes and cigarettes “necessaries” for
an “Infant” 2

when the swimmer threw away the bladder
of his compendious notes and struck out for
himself, he did admirably. Not AMURATH
an AMURATH succeeds. There can be only
one “Mr. GLADstone" in the world's his-
tory. House of Commons, always generously
inclined, gave gracious warm welcome to
the son, standing at the brass-bound box
at which his father, from time to time, had
thumped away strong Ministries.
Business done.-Second reading of London
Government Bill moved.
Thursday.—“A Blondel 1 A Blondel !”
The battle cry first heard on the Plains of
Palestine rang through the startled House
to-night. Stout SALADIN, who often heard
it in crusading days, has left on record the
confession that it was “the only thing of
the kind that really made his flesh creep.”
The spell has not lapsed in the slow move-
ment of centuries. To-night, when Sir
MAPLE BLoNDEL-BLoNDEL of Blondel (in
the county of Middlesex) takes down the
banner that for a thousand years has floated
over the battlements of Tottenham Grange,
and waves it, so to speak, in the teeth of
the Treasury Bench, PRINCE ARTHUR, albeit
buttressed on either side by the SoLIcitor-
GENERAL and the PRESIDENT of THE BoARD
of TRADE, visibly pales.
It is the old story, older than the
Crusades. Cherchez la femme. Sir BLoNDEL
cherche, but cannot find her in the folds of
the London Government Bill.
“What about the ladies?” he asks. “Can
they be aldermen? Can they be mayors?”
Here Sir BLoNDEL condescended to intro-
duce a joke that has been in the family for
three centuries. “Women,” he said, “are,
I know, sometimes spoken of as Mares. As
CHAUCER hath it ‘the grey mare is the
better horse.’ But what ** enquiring
about is M-A-Y-O-R-S.”
The Knights in the immediate neighbour-
hood of Sir BLoNDEL laughed immoderately.

holds a drawn sword in his red right hand.)
The dames in the iron-girt gallery at the
end of the hall simpered. Suddenly chang-
ing his bantering tone and shaking a mailed
fist at the Treasury Bench, Sir BLoNDEL
insisted on speedy answer to his challenge.
This PRINCE ARTHUB falteringly gave,
and Sir Knight, graciously pleased to be
gratified, ješ' his sword and strode
forth to mount his palfrey, K.", the
unresponsive paving-stones in Palace Yard.
Business done.—Further debate on London
Government Bill.
Friday.—Still debating second reading of
London Government Bill. The further we
go into the matter, the more abundant the
objections. . PRINCE ARTHUR is becoming
amazed at his own immoderation of error,
alarmed at his º of incapacity.
Comforts himself with reflection that if,
when the scheme for the creation of the
world was introduced, Mr. Lough and Dr.
CLARK had chanced to be about, they would
have moved a series of amendments.
“Odd thing when you come to think of
it,” PRINCE ARTHUR muses, “significant,
too, that the first person instrumental in

garded as a matter of urgent public import-
ance, was the Serpent in the Garden of

My childish brain (I use the epithet in a purely temporal sense)
was haunted by a terror not commonly experienced, as I under-
stand, by the ordinary infant. It arose from the uncertainty
surrounding the authorship of the plays attributed to a certain
WILLIAM SHAksPEARE. I was obsessed by the fear that I myself
might conceivably be branded with the suspicion of having pro-
duced the inferior work in question. I determined at my earliest
convenience to publish plays of my own, in order to refute so
monstrous a theory. I should have thought that the masterpieces
which I proceeded to create—some nice, others nasty—would be
easily recognised as being too subtle to have emanated from the
blundering intelligence which evolved the so-called works of W. S.
But it seems that, owing to their originality, none of them came
into sufficiently obvious competition with the journeyman labours
of the other gentleman. Also a great number of them omitted to
have themselves put on the stage. However, I have now gone
straight to the mark; and I trust that my new play—The Temp-
tations of Antony Casar; or, Much Ado about Shakspeare—will,
once for all, clear me of the suspicion of being implicated in the

To THE WERY ILLUSTRIous MR. PUNCH.
VERY ILLUSTRIous SIR,--I have the honour to send you this
#. translated for me from my own language by an English
renol.
For the first time I am visiting your great city, I arrived a few
days ago, eager to see all the beautiful works of art which it
contains. Since I was a boy I have heard of the English, and
how some of them would almost go to war to preserve an old
building, or statue in my country. At Venice, at Florence, at
Rome, the municipalities are ignorant and wilfully destroy many
beautiful objects. But there are some Italians, like myself, who
love the exquisite works of art which we have inherited. So when
your countrymen, a few months ago, founded an English society to
}. Italian monuments we were amused, but not ungrateful.
think that a certain Commendatore RICHMOND was one of the
principal members.
You can imagine that I expected to see in the capital of a
country so anxious, not to say so violent, in the defence of Italian
art, every new building and statue as beautiful as possible, and
every old work of art protected with the eager, not to say intrusive,
zeal which is displayed by your country in reference to mine.
I have seen, Sir, the #. Bar Memorial, and the statues on
the Thames Embankment and at Westminster. I wish to see no
more. In many Italian towns there are statues of GARIBALDI
which are better. I have also seen your Palace of Justice and
some other public buildings, some new streets, and Piccadilly
Circus. The latter, which should have been a noble Piazza
Centrale, is a hideous, shapeless space. It does not seem to me
much more beautiful than the ugly Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele at
Florence, which the English so loudly condemn. I have therefore
seen enough of your new buildings. The Municipality of London
is evidently no more artistic than the Municipality of Florence.
At last this morning I think to myself that there remain the old
buildings, which are no doubt protected with love and reverence.
I will visit the Cathedral of London.
As soon as I arrive I see that it is the masterpiece of a great
artist. The beauty of the building is in its form i. for there is
no colour, as in Italy. I enter by the west door. The interior of
the nave, also designed without colour, is superb. Here is a

cheap wall paper. Beneath, in gigantic black letters, is an inscrip-

“SEEING DOUBLE.”
YEs, we admit the soft impeachment: we did “see double" at
the Adelphi, and if ever there were a F. wherein to see double,
surely the Adelphi, ol āşexpo, is that place for choice. Two single
gentlemen are, at this theatre, distinctly and intelligibly rolled into
one, in the person of Mr. NorMAN For BEs, who nightly appears as
Louis XIV. and Phili Marchiali, his brother, very much to
his own satisfaction and to that of a public which loves murderous,
mysterious melodrama. 'Tis a grim old story, and if it is, to be
classed among the “blood and thunder.” pieces, surely it requires
a little “light'ning”?. Just a trifle of light comedy thrown in, and
more brilliancy, especially in the finish, would be a great relief to
this sad historical tragedy, which inspired the Anthony Hope-ful
story of The Prisoner of Zenda.
And we are forcibly reminded of this latter romantic melodrama
under the Alexandrine management by the presence in the cast of
that first-rate comedian, Mr. W. H. VERNoN, who in King Street
represented the arch-conspirator, Colonel Sapte, but here, at the
§. he appears as another arch-conspirator, The Bishop of
Wannes, “in partibus melodramaticis,” #. D'Herblay.
He is robbed of his rank in the bill, where his lordship is styled
simply “Monsieur.” The piece, excellently cast, is admirably
acted, and if “our friends in front" had only been treated to some
interspersed well-timed º and if it had ended with a blaze of
triumph, just to celebrate the marriage (an important point) of
Louise de la Vallière, º; played by Miss KATE RoRKE,

Louis PHILIPPE. However, Mr. NorMAN Forbes cannot very
well alter that now.
Little Miss VALLI VALLI is a most valli-able child-actress,

and periwig, is as thorough a villain as ever he was in the most
modern nineteenth-century costume. Miss GENEv1Eve WARD is
most impressive in her short scenes as Anne of Austria. Her
make-up and acting are both perfect. Excellent, too, is Miss
Dolores DRUMMond as the Scotch nurse, though somehow the
intended humour and pathos of the part alike miss fire.
A very strong and most effective situation at the end of the
fourth act brings down the curtain to thoroughly hearty and
rolonged applause, . In Act V. those who, with Mr. Justice

It is clear that the Government have no
light task before them if they intend to pass
even a few of the ºg. bills included in
their programme for the Session. The Small
Shoes Amendment Act, for instance, is con-
sidered by some members to be far too mild
a measure for carrying out a much needed
reform. On the other hand, I hear that
Lord CHARLEs BEREsford intends to move
its rejection when the bill comes up for
second reading. His experience in China
leads him to believe that the smallest size of
shoe is by no means unbecoming.
The Divided Skirt Act, again, is sure to
provoke a great deal of criticism. As at
resent drafted, it makes the wearing of this
orm of garment a penal offence.
Very general disappointment is expressed
in the Lobbies that #. Government has not
announced its intention of dealing drasti-
cally with Ties. It is contended that the
present size of the fashionable tie constitutes
a grave national danger. What makes the
omission stranger is that, by some technical
flaw, ties are held to be excluded from the
operation of the “Frills and Fripperies
Act” of last Session. A huge demonstration
took place at the Albert Hall last night, at
which speakers of all shades of political
opinion agreed in declaring prompt legis-
lation in the matter to be necessary, and
numerous petitions to the same effect are
being received from all parts of the country.
As usual, there are a huge number of
private bills to be brought in, though their
chance of becoming law is remote indeed.
Many of them come from those well-mean-
ing faddists who wish Parliament to spend
its time in providing a more efficient Army
and Navy, and other equally unimportant
details. These gentlemen seem incapable
of understanding that while so many serious
problems of dress-reform remain to be dealt
with, it is useless to expect the House of
Commons to waste its hours over such a

existence of the Ministry might have been
then novelise it. As to date of appearance, trumpery matter as National Defence.

And then once more he wrinkled his brow

Then he thought of the latest novel from

“That should do the deed;" and he sat
down and steadily began to read. He was

He read, and read, and read, and still

HOW TO WBITE A “PLAY NOVEL.”
(From our Erperienced Dramatist.)
KEEP as many of the names in the
original as possible, and to some extent
annex the dialogue appropriate to the
characters. Change time and scene as
much as you please. Alter the plot to suit
the *. of the stage and the com-
pany. Be sure to have a prologue in which
you can introduce what in your opinion the
novelist has unwisely omitted. Preserve
the title of the story, and obtain the consent
of the author to your proceedings. Cut
and contrive to any extent, and remember
that what may be well for the library wont
do for the stage. Knock the book about
until its creator will find it difficult to
recognise it, then serve it up before the
critics, and be told on the morning following
its F. that you have taken a dainty
dish and made a mess of it.
Another and better way. Write a play and
first come first served. But bear in mind
that the treasury of the theatre is about six
times as productive of profit as the counting-
house of the Publisher.

And with respect I press a kiss

Shoes Amendment Act, for instance, is con-
sidered by some members to be far too mild

iss Fowler's failing, a serious one for a novelist, is occasional
inability to individualise all the characters that crowd her pages.
She does not so much create men and women as she labels lay
figures, and, from an overflowing store, distributes among them
smart things to say. The smart things are very good, often in the
uickness of their insight, the profundity of their, wisdom, the
glow of their humour, and the epigrammatic turn of their phrasing,
reminiscent of GeoRGE Eliot. The difference is that whilst
every one of GEoRGE ELIoT's men, women, and children breathe
and live and have their distinct being, there are groups of Miss
Fowler's puppets who are mere names. In A Double Thread the
best characters are two of minor account—Clutterbuck, the gardener
(a fresh, original study), and the Rector, Philip Cartwright. Miss
FowlFR would have vastly increased the human interest of her
story if, after the desertion of Miss Harman by that pragmatical
rig, Captain Le Mesurier, she had married her to the Rector.
o my Baronite's fancy the gem of the novel is the story,
exquisitely told in a dozen_pages, of how the Rector loved and
lived and did not marry, Miss Fowl ER has not, as yet, nearly
fulfilled the promise of her start. That it was a bold, high flight
appears from the circumstance that a study of her second novel
suggests comparison with GEoRGE ELIoT. A Double Thread at
least sustains the promise. .

AS THAT CAN'T
ARS LONGA, VITA BREWIS.
THAT I have the artistic temperament, no one, I think, who
knows me (and has suffered from #. habit of being late for
dinner) would for a moment deny. The power of creation, too,
is in me, I feel sure, though other F. and a certain
º dislike to exertion has until now precluded my making my
Illark.
True, I wrote a poem once—the quaintest Arabesque-mistaken
for a parody, and as such printed by some stupid journal, where, it
had its measure of success. Sometimes I whistle and hum melo-
dies that surprise me by their originality, and that I cannot help
thinking, if carefully orchestrated and elaborated, might—who
knows?—revolutionise British music. I still keep, framed, a
encil sketch done when a mere boy about seven. The subject is,
think, a windmill, but about this I am not sure. There is no
doubt that the signature is my own—CECIL CARINGTON, very
clearly written—though there are critics who think it may not be a
genuine CARINgtoN, but merely a work of the same school done
perhaps by one of his masters.
I have myself no very clear opinion on the subject, but if it has
any value; that value must reside in the fact that the drawing is
unique. If I did it, it is the only one I have ever done in my life.
You will see, then, that when a great wave of ambition swept over
me and I resolved at any cost to leave my footprints on the sands
of time, the one difficulty was—which art to choose.
I decided on literature.
I would make a name, a great name. I would stand side by
side with FLAUBERT, shoulder to shoulder with Tourgenier, back
to back with BALzAc. And at the same time I would do some-
thing entirely new in that I would immediately assert myself by
fascinate and instruct the ºl. by the same work of which the
handful of great judges would say, “Here we recognise a master-
hand.” I would combine the depth and wisdom of a MEREDITH
with the exquisite style of a STEVENson, and the strange, popular
charm of a CoreLLI.
“What a good idea!” my wife said, when I communicated my
intention to her. “Will you do it this morning, dear, while I am
writing out the invitations for our dinner-party?”
“I will begin. I have my idea for a clear-cut
But please write your invitations in another room.

writing a great work of genius and earning fame and glory. Be-
sides, I shall want your advice about whom to ask, and any ad-
dresses that I may forget.”
“I assure you, DoRothy, it is never done.”
“What nonsense, CECIL. What about MILTON ? Didn't his
daughters help him 2"
“Ah, that was quite different. You see, MILTON was blind.
And I never heard that they helped him by writing invitations and
consulting him while he was writing Paradise Lost.”
“Well, Mrs. BRowNING, Mrs. CARLYLE, and Lady ByRoN, didn't
they share in their husbands' pursuits?”
I saw I had to give in, so consented.
+ + * + * *
I had definitely settled that my story should have an “artistic
ending.”. With the care and elaboration of a true artist, I had, in
my mind, polished and re-polished the final phrase. To strike the
note, to leave the impression on the reader—that is what one
should strive to do. I could not think of anything yet but the last
sentence; but the rest would come to me. And I wrote down
this phrase, the cadence of which should carry my name down
through all the ages. “Outside, the sea murmured.—Finis.”
“CECIL, dear, do the HENDERsons live at 105, or 106, Cadogan
Terrace 2. We simply must ask them—although I loathe her—
because they sent us a horrible wedding-present. Besides, I want
her to see my dress from PAQUIN. Besides, they are rather a
charming couple in a way. I am sure you would like him, because
he collects postage-stamps and recites to music in the style of
CLIFFord HARRIsoN, which makes him rather an acquisition—not
that I would allow him to do it in my house, w. you, dear?
Now, would you, dear?”
“Outside, the sea murmured,” I repeated to myself, frowning,
and lighting a cigarette.
“CECIL, dear, I hope you won't mind my asking ARTHUR
CAVENDISH. Of course he bores me because he rather lets one
have it about the Popes, and CAESARs, and the German Emperor,
and that sort of thing; but he is awfully cultured and clever, and
handsome, and chic, and a sort of celebrity. And people can go
about saying, “Who do you think I met at the CARINGToNs'?
ARTHUR CAvendish.”
“Outside, the sea murmured,” I repeated again, taking a turn
round the room. I was beginning to lose the thread of my idea.
“Outside, the sea—”
“Really, CECIL, I do think you make a mistake, shutting your-
self up for such hours with your work. It can't be good for the
brain to stick to one subject so continuously. I know what it will
be. You will be overworked, and have to go out of town in the
middle of the season. I've finished now, and I really think you

and all that are all very well, but I do think it is one's duty not
utterly to neglect one's wife and one's home. Not that I am
jealous of your art, darling. On the contrary, I should like to
spur you on and º you. Still, you must remember that you
have some social obligations. Literature is quite nice at times,
my dear, but then you know there is a time for everything.”
“Perhaps you are right, dear,” I said, laying down my pen....It
is curious how exhausting the strain of mental work is. The
greatest minds need some relaxation, and I thought that perhaps l
should find some inspiration in the rhododendrons. -

THE MODERN HERO.
NEEDLEss to say whom we refer to —
needless to say that the undivided attention
of London is at this moment concentrated
upon the
SMALL. BUT STURDY FIGURE
of TIMoTHY TIBBIts, the intrepid page-boy,
who, on Thursday of last º conveyed a
note from his master in Berkeley Square to
a house in the most distant wilds of Clapham
IN LEss THAN THREE Hours!
No sooner had the news of the errand
which TIBBITs was to undertake electrified
the town, than fifteen reporters, four photo-
graphers, and a representative of a wax-
work exhibition, were seen hastening with
all possible speed to Berkeley Square. The
youthful hero was discovere
IN THE KITCHEN
with an open Bradshaw before him, and a
Fº lozenge in his mouth. He
ooked, perhaps, slightly pale— and who
could wonder at this, bearing in mind the
stupendous task he had undertaken? But he
managed to hidehis emotion wonderfully,and
even smiled at the questions put to him.
“Yes, I shall Do IT RIGHT ENough,”
was his marvellous reply to those who
enquired whether he really had any hopes
of .# in his gigantic endeavour.
Although only twelve years of age, man
an experienced traveller might have ..
the celerity and ease with which Master
TIBBITs made his preparations for his
journey. Wisely he declined to hamper
himself by taking any luggage. Indeed, a
bag of peppermints in one pocket, and a
couple of oranges in the other, constituted
His sole EQUIPMENT
for the journey. Needless to say, his fellow-
servants assisted his preparations with the
greatest enthusiasm, and it was with visible
emotion that the family butler raised a
whistle to his lips and
SUMMonED THE HANSoM
which was to have the honour of conveying
TIBBITs for the first stage of his journey.
The driver of the vehicle selected proved to
be a Mr. John JEHU, of Bermondsey, and
we hope to publish an illustrated interview
with that gentleman in our next number.
Numerous other cabs were quickly obtained
for the photographers and reporters, and at
11.27 precisely, amid terrific cheering from
the large crowd which had assembled to
witness the departure,
THE PROCESSION STARTED.
No noteworthy incident occurred until
the Strand was reached. Here there was a
delay of some twenty minutes, as TIBBITs'
hansom was

DREW UP AT THE STATION.
We reserve for a future number a full
account of the scene on the platform, with the
PATHETIC INCIDENTs
of TIBBITs' final leave-taking. When at
last the tail-light of the train had dis-
appeared, slowly the assembly dispersed,
with many gloomy forebodings of disaster.

prise as simply foolhardy. But, just one

handful of great judges would say, “Here we recognise a master-

charm of a CoreLLI.

writing a great work of genius and earning fame and glory. Be-

“I assure you, DoRothy, it is never done.”
“What nonsense, CECIL. What about MILTON ? Didn't his

“Ah, that was quite different. You see, MILTON was blind.
And I never heard that they helped him by writing invitations and

gem of a story.

I had definitely settled that my story should have an “artistic
ending.”. With the care and elaboration of a true artist, I had, in
my mind, polished and re-polished the final phrase. To strike the
note, to leave the impression on the reader—that is what one
should strive to do. I could not think of anything yet but the last
sentence; but the rest would come to me. And I wrote down
this phrase, the cadence of which should carry my name down
through all the ages. “Outside, the sea murmured.—Finis.”
“CECIL, dear, do the HENDERsons live at 105, or 106, Cadogan
Terrace? We simply must ask them—although I loathe her—
because they sent us a horrible wedding-present. Besides, I want
her to see my dress from PAQUIN. Besides, they are rather a
charming couple in a way. I am sure you would º him, because
he collects postage-stamps and recites to music in the style of
CLIFFord HARRIson, which makes him rather an acquisition—not
that I would allow him to do it in my house, w. you, dear?
Now, would you, dear?”
“Outside, the sea murmured,” I repeated to myself, frowning,
and lighting a cigarette.

ARTHUR CAvendish.”
“Outside, the sea murmured,” I repeated again, taking a turn
round the room. I was beginning to lose the thread of my idea.
“Outside, the sea—”
“Really, CECIL, I do think you make a mistake, shutting your-
self up for such hours with your work. It can't be good for the
brain to stick to one subject so continuously. I know what it will
be. You will be overworked, and have to go out of town in the
middle of the season. I've finished now, and I really think you

spur you on and ºl. you. Still, you must remember that you
have some social obligations. Literature is quite nice at times,
my dear, but then you know there is a time for everything.”

THE MODERN HERO.
NEEDLEss to say whom we refer to —
needless to say that the undivided attention
of London is at this moment concentrated
upon the
SMALL, BUT STURDY FIGURE
of TIMOTHY TIBBIts, the intrepid page-boy,
who, on Thursday of last º conveyed a
note from his master in Berkeley Square to
a house in the most distant wilds of Clapham
IN LEss THAN THREE Hours!
No sooner had the news of the errand
which TIBBITs was to undertake electrified
the town, than fifteen reporters, four photo-
graphers, and a representative of a wax-
work exhibition, were seen hastening with
all possible speed to Berkeley Square. The
youthful hero was discovere
IN THE KITCHEN
with an open Bradshaw before him, and a
ppermint lozenge in his mouth. He
ooked, perhaps, slightly pale — and who
could wonder at this, bearing in mind the
stupendous task he had undertaken? But he
managed to hidehis emotion wonderfully,and
even smiled at the questions put to him.
“YEs, I shall Do IT RIGHT ENough,”
was his marvellous reply to those who
enquired whether he really had any hopes
of succeeding in his gigantic endeavour.
Although only twelve years of age, many
an experienced traveller might have envied
the celerity and ease with which Master
TIBBITs made his preparations for his
; Wisely he declined to hamper
imself by taking any luggage. Indeed, a
bag of peppermints in one pocket, and a
couple of oranges in the other, constituted
His sole Equipment
for the journey. Needless to say, his fellow-
servants assisted his preparations with the
greatest enthusiasm, and it was with visible
emotion that the family butler raised a
whistle to his lips and
SUMMonED THE HANsom
which was to have the honour of conveying
TIBBITs for the first stage of his journey.
The driver of the vehicle selected proved to
be a Mr. John JEHU, of Bermondsey, and
we hope to publish an illustrated interview
with that gentleman in our next number.
Numerous other cabs were quickly obtained
for the photographers and reporters, and at
11.27 precisely, amid terrific cheering from
the large crowd which had assembled to
witness the departure,
THE PROCESSION STARTED.
No noteworthy incident occurred until
the Strand was reached. Here there was a
delay of some twenty minutes, as TIBBITs'
hansom was
BoARDED BY THE EDITOR
of an evening paper, who insisted on learning
the hero's views on Waccination, the London
Government Bill, and the Modern Drama.
Moving on again, the perils of Waterloo
Bridge were successfully negotiated, and
shortly afterwards the procession
DREW UP AT THE STATION.
We reserve for a future number a full
account of the scene on the platform, with the
PATHETIC INCIDENTS
of TIBBITs' final leave-taking. When at
last the tail-light of the train had dis-
appeared, slowly the assembly dispersed,
with many gloomy forebodings of disaster.
Some did not hesitate to describe the enter-
prise as simply foolhardy. But, just one
hour later,
FEAR GAVE PLACE To Joy
when a telegram was received, announcing
that the heroic undertaking
HAD BEEN safely. Accomplished 1
London breathed again. Arrangements
were quickly made for an illumination, and
in Berkeley Square a
GRAND DIsPLAY of FIREworks
fitly expressed the general rejoicing that
success had crowned Master TIMoTHY
TIBBITs’ unrivalled feat of heroism. For a
full description of these demonstrations, as
well as for a detailed account of the return
journey, consult our future issues.
ALARMING INTELLIGENCE 1 — “Punch in
the hands of the house-breakers.” So ran
a paragraph in one of the evening papers,
but it turned out, on further inquiry, to refer
to the widening of Fleet Street, and we
breathed again.

in mine by a simple but effective manoeuvre, and marched him,
unresisting, into the passage. “You see,” I remarked, pleasantly

“Right,” he said, “but we don't want to go wakin' up people

“Now observe what follows,” I said, smiling. “I slip my
hand, with a quick, clean movement, up your arm, grasp you by
the wrist, and—”
“And what?” he asked.
I was obliged to admit that perhaps I had not made sufficientl
sure to “grasp my adversary at the first attempt.” “However,”
I added, “you see the general idea of the thing.” He said he saw
that, and thought it first-rate. “Now,” said I, “I’ll show you
another little dodge. Just catch me from behind and pinion my
arms.”
“Like this 'ere?" he said. . He was holding me rather too
tight, but I said it would do very well.
“I’ll tell you exactly what I Pºlº. to do,” I explained. “I
shall bend my knees first, which will cause your hold to slip over
my shoulders. I shall next free my arms, a movement which,
according to my instructions, I shall probably have no º
executing, drop on my right knee, pull you over my shoulder,
§. deposit you on the ground before me with a heavy thud—
ow 1 " . . . .
There was a heavy thud—but he didn't make it. I don't know
when I have becn more surprised.
“It's very singular,” I could not help saying, “but by all the
rules, I ought to be on top of you!”
“Ah,” he said, philosophically, as he sat on my chest, “things
will 'appen rum sometimes. Like to try it agin?’
“No, not that one,” said I; “but there's rather a pretty trick I
could teach you, if you'll let me get up.”
“Allays willing to learn, guv'nor,” said the Burglar, and assisted
me to rise.
“Turn your back to me,” I told him, “and let me seize
you by the collar. You will find that, without any exertion of
strength on my part, I can throw you. I'll tell you how I do it
afterwards.”
He obeyed, and I placed one foot just behind his knee, and
º and pulled simultaneously, which should have deposited
im instantly on his back. But either I pressed harder than I
pulled, or pulled harder than I pressed—all I know is that I
pºintly found myself turning some kind of somersault over his
ead.
“You fell very clever that time,” said the Burglar, gravely.
A coarser nature might have been tempted to smile; but, criminal
as he was, the man was not without natural fºrceding
“'Ow d'yer manage to do it without 'urting yourself?”
As a matter of fact I had not managed to do so. I doubt if it
would have been possible ; but I said carelessly that it was just a
knack, “But that's nothing,” I added. “I must show you one
more dodge: you lie down on the floor and let me get hold of your
foot, and see what happens.”
What ought to have happened was that I should, by twisting his
foot, have turned him over on his face, then held him behind the
knee, and exerted leverage so as to force his foot backwards—
which would have rendered him utterly powerless. What actually
id happen was that he kicked me º: severely in the stomach.
4. y; you ain't done?” said the Burglar, “Lord! I'm just
beginnin' to enjoy myself, I am!”
But I was getting a little discouraged. “No,” I said, “we
won't play any more, I think. To tell you the truth, I've been
rather taken in by some articles in one of the magazines by a man
called BARTON-WRIGHT. He calls his precious art of self-defence

“It ain't rot,” said the Burglar, “it’s all right enqugh: that is l’”
“It can't be,” I said, “if it had been, you wouldn't have had a

“You done very well for a beginner,” he said, kindly, “and
you're game enough. , But, yer see, I've bin readin' up them
rules too, and practisin' of them wiv a pal, so it's no bloomin'
wonder—”
I wrung his hand warmly—I couldn't help it, so touched was I
by the chivalrous delicacy with which he at once restored my self-
respect and my belief in Mr. BART.on-Wright.
“Thank you,” I said, “you're a good fellow for telling me. I
could not understand why wasn't more successful!”
“Don’t you fret, guv'nor l’’ he said. “If ever I see a morril
vict'ry in this world, it was you won it. And now I won't keep
you up no longer. Don't come to the door in them pijammers.
I can let myself out.”
..I was so pleased with the honest fellow that I actually reminded
him he was forgetting, the plate, and he was so pleased with me
that he positively declined to carry off anything but a spoon and
fork as a souvenir.
It is true he chose the only two which had a hall-mark; but I
do not §º. them to him. For now I know that I really can

BORES.
(By One of Them.)
THERE are various kinds of bores; there is, for instance, the wild
boar, and the tame bore, and it is the latter who drives you wild.
The hide of the wild boar is covered with short, strong bristles,
which can turn the point of a spear; the hide of the tame bore is,
however, absolutely impenetrable. Wild boars have º ceased
to roam about in this country, although a number of them are
preserved in an enclosure in Windsor Forest; tame bores are still
to be found in great numbers roaming about quite freely, and
many of them are very well preserved.
Except when disturbed in his haunts, the wild boar does not, as
a rule, attack human beings; the tame bore, on the other hand,
seeks out his victims and runs them down even when they are
most anxious to avoid him.
Years ago, in the mansions of the mighty, one of the chief dishes
at Christmas time was Boar's Head, which was carried in state
into the dining-hall, accompanied by musicians and mummers,
and set upon the table with much pomp and ceremony; but even
to this dav at some fashionable #.er parties a bore's head is
occasionally seen at the table.
In conclusion, I should like to point out with pardonable pride
that I have successfully resisted the temptation to allude to the
boas of feathers or furs worn by ladies; and I have not even so
much as hinted at the boa-constrictor.

Or, The New Art of Self-Defence,
It was in the dead of night, and I awoke to hear stealthy move.
ments below, and to smell the fragrance of an excellent cigar—one
of my own. I instantly realised that there was a burglar in the
house, and remembered that I was the only male inmate, but it
never occurred to me for a moment to lock my door and hide
under the bed-clothes. On the contrary, I welcomed an encounter
in which I knew that all the odds would be on my side. So, just
as I was, in my pyjamas, without a ſº or anything, I slipped
down to my study (where the smell of cigars seemed to come
from), and walked in. There was the burglar, just mixing
himself a second whisky and soda. He was rather a bigger
burglar than I had expected—but that was immaterial to me. A
selection from my plate-basket lay ready for packing on the table
by his side.
“I fear,” I began, with withering sarcasm, “I am interrupting

“If I was you,” he replied, with §. composure, “I should
be more afeared o' ketching cold in them things.”
“Never mind that,” I replied. “I come for a purpose. I
think it is only fair to warn you at once that you are practically a
lost man.”
“None o' that, guv'nor l’’ he said, and sprang to his feet. “No
whistling fur no cops, or else—l"
“I shall not summon anyF. I said, with a quiet conscious-
ness of power. “I shall deal with you single-handed !”
“Willyer, now?” he replied, looking me up and down. “Lorl

“You are probably thinking,” I said, divining his thoughts at
once, “that I don't appear a very formidable antagonist 2 "
“Well,” he said, “yer don't look no bloomin' SANDow, and
that's a fact. Still, yer may be a reglar little lion, like, when yer
rowsed. Or agin, yer mayn't. There's no tellin'!”
“Before we put it to the test,” said I, “I feel bound to mention
you entirely at my .*. You may spare yourself considerable
pain, and even a broken bone or two (for I shall not hesitate to go
to any extremes) if you yield at once.”
“Let's see what you can do fust,” he said.
“You shall,” I replied. “I will begin by showing you a method
of conducting “an undesirable person' (for Imust say I consideryou
a most undesirable person) out of a room. I shall take you into
the ărawing - room, where we shall have more room for
experiments.”
With these words, I suddenly seized him, to his unfeigned
surprise, by the left wrist with my left hand, and pulled him
towards me; then, turning sharply on my heels, I locked his arm
in mine by a simple but effective manoeuvre, and marched him,
unresisting, into the passage. “You see,” I remarked, pleasantly

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
AN obvious, though not necessarily fatal, defect in The Kingdom
of Hate (HUTCHINson) is that, in plot and treatment, it persis-
tently recalls the Prisoner of Zenda. If Mr. ToM GALLON had
been first in this picturesque field, Mr. ANTHoNY HoPE would have
had to take to writing Tatterley. My Baronite is inclined to
think that as the domain is so distinctly marked, a writer of such
rich resources, such marked originality, would have been wise to
avoid it. Since Mr. GALLoN thought otherwise, and has plunged in.
it must be said he acquits himself admirably. The book is full of
life, flashing forth in all kinds of unexpected guises and quarters.
Bernard Aubanel is a sort of Three Musketeers rolled into one.
He has a delightful Squire in Jimmy Witherby, the Princess is
charming, and the Count leaves nothing to be desired in the wa
of villainy. . It is well to begin the story whilst the nights are sti
long, for it is hard to put it down before being galloped breath-
lessly to the end.
Messrs. GAY & BIRD have had a happy thought in starting their
library of Biblots with a new edition of Coleridge's Table Talk.
It makes a dainty little volume that will snugly rest in the pocket,
and come forth the companion of chance spare moments. Mr.
Potter BRIscoe has admirably compiled the book on the*.
of selecting the material most likely to interest the general reader.
The talk is divided under various heads, an index completing
convenience. Dr. DIBDEN iringly records of ColerDGE,
that on an occasion when he was privileged to be in his company,
“he spoke for nearly two hours with unhesitating and unin-
terrupted fluency.” That, in itself, is nothing. Mr. CALDwell,
with or without an audience in the House of Commons, could
“do it on 'is 'ead.”
The Confounding of Camelia (HEINEMANN) is a confºundedly
bad title, which repels. , Nor are the opening chapters of the :
persuasive. My Baronite confesses that after struggling º: -

Being a conscientious person, on his oath to truly try the case, he
went on to what he anticipated would be the bitter end and found
it very good. , Miss Sedgwick happily describes the purport of her
story, when she writes of a dusty little moth beating dying wings
near the ground, its eyes fixed on the exquisite butterfly tilting
its white loveliness in the sunshine. The moth is Cousin Mary, a
plain-looking dependant; the butterfly is the well-born, beautiful,
rich Camelia. It is the moth, suddenly transformed by the
passion of love, that makes the tragedy. The scenes between
Mary and her flighty cousin when the wounded moth is fluttering
nearer the ground, are dramatically conceived, and powerfully
written. The difficulty is to understand the fatal fascination the
awkwardly named Perior has for marriageable young women. To
conversation soothing by repeatedly assuring a lady she is a liar.
Obviously he is a woman's man, an inscrutable being evolved out
of woman's inner consciousness. THE BARon DR. B.-W.

R. I., PICCADILLY.
“Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours.”
'Tis a long title. , Were only the initials used of “Royal
Institute Painters,” it figures out lugubriously as “R.I.P.”
"Now, “Requiescat in Pace” is not, and never can be, the motto of
a going concern, unless it be a going-to-decay concern, which is
}. another matter, and is not in the least applicable to the
oyal Institute, which is as fresh as paint and doing uncom-
monly well, as, of course, must be the case with any Artistic
Society that has the good fortune to secure as a member of its
Council, Sir John TENNIEL, R.P.A.
Now, we should like so much to give the P.I. a lift. Only we
do not see why, as a rich association, the members, should not
º the public a lift, and then the public would not fatigue itself
walking up that tiring flight of steps leading to the galleries
above. That is the sort of “lift” the P.I. wants. How manv
are there, who, saying, “Blowed if I go up those stairs l'' would
willingly mount by “the lift,” even if there were charged for the
luxury the ridiculously small sum of one halfpenny! Let the
Council consider it. Who are its members ? Let us refer to the
list. Let the “AUMonTER." mº". his savings-box for the
mounting receipts. The lift will, of course, be “for passengers
*. and therefore “BALE "may not see any advantage to him-
self personally. Mr. PLUM BUNDY will welcome it, if he be not a
Hot Cross BUNDY; while Mr. FAHEY (E. H.) will be willing to spare
himself any Fahey-tigue. Any one rejoicing in the delightful name
of FULLEYLovE, will, of course, be in raptures with the idea: he'll
fully love it. what has ever been uttered by Johnson on the sub-
ject some Boswell will inform us. He who bears the dramatically
onoured name of SHERIDAN KNowLEs will certainly vote for
doing it; Acta non verba must be his motto. WILLIAM RAINEY
Day. It only remains for the Vice-President to take heart of
grace; to weep and Wimper is useless. Then let the Treasurer KING
take a right regal view of the ways and means at command, and
let the President show himself as GREgory the Great, for it only
requires his Presidential assent, and up goes the “ascenseur.”
Finally, there is not a water-colour picture but is improved by a
“mount”; therefore a collection of §. ought to have a “lift.”
However, it is a show well worth the climb. Pause filially before
the work of DADD, FRANK DADD (18), a grand-DADD ! Refresh your-
self with RICHARDson’s “Early Summer” (23). Read your Vicar
of Wakefield, and discover if Mr. DollMAN is quite correct in his
good picture of “Moses at the Fair.” Wonder wistfully at the
mist-erious maid, who is idling in SAINToN’s “The Idyll” (50).
Admire MoTTRAM's Cornish landscape º and make up your mind
to take a holiday in the neighbourhood. If you love the sea, rejoice
in the Ramsgate boats (78); and then, if you have the ready coin,
offer the price marked in guineas, and in exchange you'll get a
alfpenny, a real J. C. HALFPENNY for it (80). Linger in “A
Surrey Lane,” by MARKs (107). Examine the perspective gilt
frame in which the honorary member, Count SECKENDoRF, enshrines
his “Venice” (153). Look in at the “Kashmir Gate” of WILLIAM
SIMPson. Notice (292) the bloom that is on the Rye Marshes of
GREEN, R.I. (why not the “R.I.” Marshes?); stand under your
umbrella for a good view of “Young Holland" (305), because it's
RAINEY: and in Edward GREGoRY's circular picture in golden
frame, acknowledge the type of a “good all round”, artist. The
“go" in CHANTREY Corbould's work, representing a horse career-
ing away and singing to himself “The Girl I left behind me,” is
excellent. No wonder she fell off that wonderful horse, whose
owner has evidently tried to match his colour by providing him
with saddle and uncommonly stiff reins to match.
We regret that neither space nor time will permit us to mention
many notable works, but the visitor will be able to pass a couple
of hours there with pleasure and profit. On no account must he
miss the Miniatures, from which to select would be invidious.
Ascend to the Gallery of the R.I. and enjoy yourself.
TWO OR THREE NAPOLEONS.
On the same day that the Daily Telegraph recorded the extra-
ordinary success of M. CoquELIN at the Porte St. Martin, as
Napoleon, there appeared also, in the same paper, an interesting
article on CHARLoTTE SAUNDERs, an actress once well-known to
theatrisal fame as “a Robson in petticoats; ” to appreciate which
simile, it is evidently necessary to have seen that wonderful little

ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL.
(Communicated by Astral Wireless
Telegraphy.)
SIR,-As I did witness the destruction of
Paul's in the Great Fire, and the building
of it anew by Sir CHRISToPHER WREN
the King's Surveyor, I have observed
with concern that there hath been much
controversie of late touching sundry “de-
corations” therein. Although I did go at
times to Paul's, and ranged about to many
churches, I confess that I did observe the
handsome women rather than the archi.
tecture or the ornaments of the structure.
Moreover . I did judge better the colours
of fine cloathes than the paynting of
walls.
Being therefore but little versed in such
matters, I have had much talk with my
friend, Mr. EvelyN, a most excellen'
person, and so much above others in all
manner of learning, and finally we did
resolve to view Paul's. Touching this
controversie it had been wise to discourse
with Sir CHRISTcPher WREN himself, but
he, still a lover cf astronomick discoverie
hath set out on a distant journey to Saturn
and we know not whither any communi
cation should be sent.
Up, as I was wont to repeat with needles:

rising) in my private diary, since discovered
and transcribed by sundry prying fooles
With Mr. EvelyN to Paul's betimes. Lord
how black the great portico is now! . It was
once as white as my wife's hands, of which
the wretch was mighty proud. We entered
the church, of course unperceived, and
advanced towards the quire. I would i
had been Sunday, for then I might have
seen some fine women, but on this day J
could not spy one, and did observe only
men in sombre and graceless attire.
However I had scant time to gaze about
me, for Mr. Evelyn stopped and directed my
attention to the quire. In truth it was a
mighty fine sight, and more brilliant than
any playhouse I ever did see. But as I fell
to praising it, Mr. EveryN checked me
gravely, and told me this was not a
playhouse but a church. Whereupon I
perceiving my error, did admit that he was
right, for he is a most excellent person
Nevertheless brave colours are always
pleasing to me. At this moment I observed
a. iſ. wench entering the church, and
fell to gazing at her as we moved onward.
Again Mr. EvelyN stopped, and this time
spake wrathfully of certain payntings under
the great dome. Even I, neglecting the
comely young woman, did gaze aloft untill
my head aked, and my eyes yet more. I
do love brave colours, but these are over-
done. They are red and green and gold.
I said to Mr. EvelyN that these payntings
would have adorned in a very handsome
manner the place for the musick at Fox
Hall, which was desired to be mighty gay
and divertising, and also, knowing his love
for gardens, that the green was brighter
than grass in spring-time. He told me that
my comments on these, as on the colours
in the quire, were the just condemnation of
such adornment, if it could be so called by
any, but that he could perceive even greater
faults, inasmuch as the paynter had inserted
new pannels where Sir CHRISToPHERWREN
had placed none, and also an inscription in
black letters of a vast size. I durst not say
one word in defence of an ignorant paynter
who did venture to amend the architecture
of the King's Surveyor.

I heard not all, inasmuch as I was en-
deavouring to attract the pretty wench by
smiling at her. Lord, what a fool I was l
I had forgot that I am now invisible. So
after a time I did hearken again to the
words of Mr. EvelyN, who is a very fine
gentleman, and he was saying that Sir
CHRISToPHER WREN did have much trouble
of mind and loss of money through the
Deane and others in his day, which filled
me with indignation. I was the more
wroth when he went on to reproach the
present generation of citizens, who care
even less for stately buildings. In truth I
did even forget the handsome young
woman, and quitted the church as wrath-
fully as Mr. EvelyN himself. At the
moment of our going forth he turned once

fate-deciding halfpenny, and toss it !
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A Modern Mercenary (SMITH, ELDER) is a very good story, and
would have been better still if it weren't for the Great Powers.
Not content with a tale of private adventure of the good old-
fashioned swash-buckling style, K. and H. PRITCHARD must needs
drag in Germany, Russia, and eke Great Britain. Lord SALISBURY
has tried his hand in the effort to control the Concert of the
Powers. According to ELLIs. AsHMEAD BARTLETT, Knight (of
Sheffield), he did not do so well as at least one other in the same
position might. Our joint authors are not more successful. Their
idea of the byeways of Imperial politics is crude, and their method
of presenting it not clear: My Baronite, bewildered with the deep
designs of Germany on “the independent State of Māasau,” runs
§. against Russia, and is forthwith floored by the manoeuvres of
reat Britain. These little personal excitements apart—and it
would have been so easy to have spared them—it is a .
picturesque story. . It is entitled A Modern Mercenary because gold
will not purchase the hero.
Mr. E. W. HoRNUNg's hero in The Amateur Cracksman
º & Co.) is a certain A. J. Raffles, man about town, slow
owler of surpassing merit, fascinating companion and prince of
criminals. Throu ãº. the eight stories of which the book is
composed, and in all of which A. J. Ra plays the leading part,
we live in an atmosphere as unmoral as any atmosphere can
possibly be. Nothing stops Raffles. He scales walls, picks locks,
abstracts jewels, baffles not merely the detectives but also the
of resource, and his convincing aptitude for every undertaking.
Not even when he decides on a murder do our sympathies desert
him, for the intended victim is one of the meanest and wickedest
of mankind, not so deeply steeped in villainy, tº: as R. L.
STEvenson's President of the Suicide Club, but a sufficiently
abandoned scoundrel for all that. The careless reader who rises
from the absorbing #. of this book is as likely as not to call
for his dark lantern, his skeleton keys and his jemmy, and to sally
forth on an errand of crime, fully convinced, as he must have been
by Mr. HoRNUNg's art, that the protecting genius of Raffles will
bring him unscathed and much wealthier through his adventures.
Raffles has a foil, the supposed narrator of the stories, one Bunny,
who fulfils his purpose in life by being as fatuous as such foils (e.g.
Sherlock Holmes's Watson) usually are. In the end, of course,
Bunny suffers while A. J. Raffles escapes. Anyway, well done
Mr. E. W. HoRNUNg, says the Assistant Baronite.
The name of WARD, celebrated in fiction through the productions
of Mrs. HUMPHRY, will derive fresh lustre from the production of
Mrs. WILFRID, Indeed, One Poor Scruple (Long MANs) seems, to
this Baronite, far and away better work than anything which the
authoress of Robert Elsmere has given to the world. There is a
curious—but, as a preliminary note shows, an accidental-likeness
between its story and the story of Helbeck of Bannisdale. But in
tone and treatment the two books are quite unlike... Mrs.
WILFRID's is to Mrs. HUMPHRY's, a fine Lafite to small beer.
The authoress of Qne Poor Scruple knows not only how to write,
but what she is writing about. yone who, on your Baronite's

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A Modern Mercenary (SMITH, ELDER) is a very good story, and
would have been better still if it weren't for the Great Powers.
Not content with a tale of private adventure of the good old-
fashioned swash-buckling style, K. and H. PRITCHARD must needs
drag in Germany, Russia, and eke Great Britain. Lord SALISBURY
has tried his hand in the effort to control the Concert of the
Powers. According to ELLIs Ash MEAD BARTLETT, Knight (of
Sheffield), he did not do so well as at least one other in the same
position #. Our joint authors are not more successful. Their
idea of the byeways of Imperial#. is crude, and their method
of presenting it not clear. My Baronite, bewildered with the deep
designs of Germany on “the independent State of Māasau,” runs
§. against Russia, and is forthwith floored by the manoeuvres of
reat Britain. These little personal excitements apart—and it
would have been so easy to have spared them—it is a .
picturesque story. . It is entitled A Modern Mercenary because gold
will not purchase the hero.
Mr. E. W. HoRNUNg's hero in The Amateur Cracksman
ſº & Co.) is a certain A. J. Raffles, man about town, slow
owler of surpassing merit, fascinating º and prince of
criminals. Throu ãº. the eight stories of which the book is
composed, and in all of which A. J. Ra plays the leading part,
we live in an atmosphere as unmoral as any atmosphere can
possibly be. Nothing stops Raffles. He scales walls, picks locks,
abstracts jewels, baffles not merely the detectives but also the
of resource, and his convincing aptitude for every undertaking.
Not even when he decides on a murder do our sympathies desert
him, for the intended victim is one of the meanest and wickedest
of mankind, not so deeply steeped in villainy, perhaps, as R. L.
STEvenson's President of the Suicide Club, but a sufficiently
abandoned scoundrel for all that. The careless reader who rises
from the absorbing #. of this book is as likely as not to call
for his dark lantern, his skeleton keys and his jemmy, and to sally
forth on an errand of crime, fully convinced, as he must have been
by Mr. HoRNUNg's art, that the protecting genius of Raffles will
bring him unscathed and much wealthier through his adventures.
Raffles has a foil, the supposed narrator of the stories, one Bunny,
who fulfils his purpose in life by being as fatuous as such foils (e.g.
Sherlock Holmes's Watson) usually are. In the end, of course,
Bunny suffers while A. J. Raffles escapes. Anyway, well done
Mr. E. W. HoRNUNg, says the Assistant Baronite. -
The name of WARD, celebrated in fiction through the productions
of Mrs. HUMPHRY, will derive fresh lustre from the production of
Mrs. WILFRID, Indeed, One Poor Scruple (Long MANs) seems, to
this Baronite, far and away better work than anything which the
authoress of Robert Elsmere has given to the world. There is a
curious—but, as a preliminary note shows, an accidental—likeness
between its story and the story of Helbeck of Bannisdale. But in
tone and treatment the two books are quite unlike. Mrs.
WILFRID's is to Mrs. HUMPHRY's, a fine Lafite to small beer.
The authoress of One Poor irº. knows not only how to write,
but what she is writing about. yone who, on your Baronite's

idea of the byeways of Imperial#. is crude, and their method
of presenting it not clear, My Baronite, bewildered with the deep
designs of Germany on “the independent State of Māasau,” runs
up against Russia, and is forthwith floored by the manoeuvres of
reat Britain. These little personal excitements apart—and it
would have been so easy to have spared them—it is a º
picturesque story. . It is entitled A Modern Mercenary because gold
will not purchase the hero.
Mr. E. W. HoRNUNg's hero in The Amateur Cracksman
(METHUEN & Co.) is a certain A. J. Raffles, man about town, slow
bowler of surpassing merit, fascinating companion and prince of
criminals. Throu ãº. the eight stories of which the book is
composed, and in all of which A. J. Ra plays the leading part,
we live in an atmosphere as unmoral as any atmosphere can
possibly be. Nothing stops Raffles. He scales walls, picks locks,
abstracts jewels, baffles not merely the detectives but also the
of resource, and his convincing aptitude for every undertaking.
Not even when he decides on a murder do our sympathies desert
him, for the intended victim is one of the meanest and wickedest
of mankind, not so deeply steeped in villainy, perhaps, as R. L.
STEvenson's President of the Suicide Club, but a sufficiently
abandoned scoundrel for all that. The careless reader who rises
from the absorbing #: of this book is as likely as not to call
for his dark lantern, his skeleton keys and his jemmy, and to sally
forth on an errand of crime, fully convinced, as he must have been
by Mr. HoRNUNg's art, that the protecting genius, of Raffles will
bring him unscathed and much wealthier through his adventures.
Raffles has a foil, the supposed narrator of the stories, one Bunny,
who fulfils his purpose in life by being as fatuous as such foils (e.g.
Sherlock Holmes's Watson) usually are. In the end, of course,
Bunny suffers while A. J. Raffles escapes. Anyway, well done
Mr. E. W. HoRNUNG, says the Assistant Baronite.
The name of WARD, celebrated in fiction through the productions
of Mrs. HUMPHRY, will derive fresh lustre from the production of
Mrs. WILFRID, Indeed, One Poor Scruple (Long MANs) seems, to
this Baronite, far and away better work than anything which the
authoress of Robert Elsmere has given to the world. There is a
curious—but, as a preliminary note shows, an accidental—likeness
between its story and the story of Helbeck of Bannisdale. But in
tone and treatment the two books are quite unlike. Mrs.
WILFRID's is to Mrs. HUMPHRY's, a fine Lafite to small beer.
The authoress of One Poor jºr'ſ. knows not only how to write,
but what she is writing about. y one who, on your Baronite's

us captivated by his rollicking high spirits, his unfailing originality

THE NEW POETRY.
(See “Good Words” for April, on

Away with the old poetical “plant."
That our ancestors hugged and cherished
'Tis time that the bygone style of chant
With its perpetrators perished.
Away with the rhymes that represent
Loves, seasons, the Bard's internals
(This last to a much too free extent,
A la Lancet and such-like journals.)
For the times have changed and the Muse's
tone
Since the advent of RUDYARD KIPLING;
The ancient restraints are overthrown
That the poet's wit were crippling.
He can now sing in technical terms of things
Like pistons and valves and boilers,
Not Spring, but of locomotive springs,
In the slang of the smoke-grimed toilers.
He can tune his lyre to the Song o' the Ship
(Not LoNGFELLow's Ship, but a liner),
In stokehold and gun-room depict a trip
With the air of a boat-designer.
No matter what handicraft or trade,
The constructor of odes will know it;
In electrical times not born but made
Is the new Polytechnic Poetl

French women were beastly rude. -
Mother. You mustn't speak like that of

often have I told you not to say “beastly”?
Miss Tomboy. Well, they were rude. They
called me a little cabbage (mon petit chou).
The next time they do that I shall call them
old French beans.
THE Daily flºº. informed us that “A
constable in the Leeds force has had a pic-
ture accepted by the Royal Academy for the

OUR “ADORED LYDIA.” -
It may contribute to the satisfactory results of , a certain
“benefit performance”, to mention here that it ought to be a
special object of attraction to all middle-aged playgoers for the
sake of the bénéficiaire, who, with a charm and grace peculiarl
her own, delighted not a few of us when she was a pretty §
lost among seven dwarfs (or bears, was it?) in an extravaganza
at the Haymarket Theatre, tempore Buckstonio, afterwards drawin
crowded houses to see her, still a growing girl, playing wi
Magic Toys at the St. James's Theatre, and º, as a
grown woman, apparently toujours dans, sa première jeunesse,
º acting, and dancing in the liveliest and most takin
style, in company with LIONEL BRough, WILLIE Edouin, an
other amusing histrions, and known to all theatre-goers as Lydia
THoMPson. At the Lyceum Theatre, on the second of May,
LYDIA will, no doubt, be seconded by many of her former com-
panions on the stage, and will receive “one bumper at parting ”
to her health and happiness from troops of “friends in front.”
SHERIDAN's sentimental Julia says to lively Lydia, “Come, come
LYDIA, hope for the best,” and when our LYDIA faces the crowded
scene am I now to go through l'. Of course, the clever actress
will go through it in first-rate style, and in anticipation, we wish
her every success.
ADVICE GRATIs.—The Bishop of WAKEFIELD has denounced

His Lordship should object to Monday papers, which are prepared
on the Sunday, whereas the Sunday paper only involves late hours
on Saturday night. But how would the Bishoprelish his Monday's

His Lordship is Bishop, might, in his §: have shaken his pow-

be observed as a day of entire rest for everybody from everything

poor people who go to church, and yet earn their daily bread, on

Conside RATIons For CANDIDATEs.-Isn't a “mediocrity” the
most appropriate representative of all majorities, could the people
be fairly polled? Does not the majority in any assembly, as in
any nation, consist of mediocrities? And, after all, what is
“mediocrity” 2 . It is “betwixt and between.” Neither one thing
nor t'other. It is the middle state of existence on earth. It is a
“reflecting medium; ” it reflects colours from all sides and blends
them. “Reflecting” it is cautious and uninitiating; mediocrity

THE ART OF LYING ;
OR, THE MENDAcious MANICURIST.
ARTHUR STRong-on-THE-WING PINERo is
to be congratulated on his Gay Lord Quez,
and Mr. John HARE on his production of the
piece; also on his inducing Messrs. CHUD-
LEIGH and Boucicault to allow Miss IRENE
VANERUGH to appear at the Globe as the
mendacious heroine. The play ought to
have been called Sapphira; or, Unlimited
Lie-ability. We have had Foote's The
Liar, and we have had Jones's The Liars;
but the heroine of this piece by PINERo puts
all others quite out of court as mere feeble
amateurs in the art of mendacity. She has
“a heart” and lips “for falsehood framed,”
and, in the end, lying to the last, she marries
a perfect specimen of “the bounder,” “a
pretentious Professional Palmist,” capitally
played by Mr. FRANK GILLMoRE.
Mr. JoHN HARE, as the self-reformed,
middle-aged rake, gives us a delightful im-
personation; if there be a fault, it is in his
“make-up,” in which there is not a trace
on his features of the life he is supposed to
have led for at least the last twenty-seven
“ARE YOU As MUCH AGAINST “BloomERs' As EveR,

least so Mr. PINERo tells us; but Mr. John
HARE's Nobleman is so jolly, hale, and
hearty, that it is impossible to detect the
*: sign of the roué about him.
r. GILBERT HARE, as Sir Chichester
Frayne, the friend, ally, and boon com-
E. of Lord Quez, is another old repro-
ate on whose constitution, evidently inferior
to that of his noble friend, his former gay
life and, subsequently, the climate of West
Africa, have told considerably. These com-
bined influences have so affected his personal
manner and appearance that it is sometimes
difficult, when he is facing the audience, to
believe that he is not Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT,
and when he turns away from the footlights
to walk up the stage, more than one could
swear they were beholding a back view of
Sir HENRY IRVING. Mr. GILBERT HARE's
double impersonation is a veritable triumph.
Miss FANNY ColeMAN's good old-world,
unworldly Countess of Owbridge is a delight-
ful sketch; and Miss MABEL TERRY-Lewis
does her best with the colourless and totally
uninteresting semi-heroine.
Mr. CHARLEs CHERRY gets all that can be
got out of the character of the impulsive,
amorous, “touch-and-go” Captain Bastling,
according to his lordship's own showing,
would have behaved at §. Bastling's
age (about twenty-five 2), had he been placed
in a similar situation and tempted by such
a deceitful, artful, unprincipled little wretch
as is Sapphira Fullgarney, as intended to be
played, and as the character is inimitably
Fº by Miss IRENE WANBRUGH. Only

she rings the bell for assistance in the
third act; it is the situation on which the

getting a laugh by her exaggerated “busi-
ness” when every one .# be holding
their breath, being on the tenterhooks of
excitement as to the result.
The Bishop of Wide-a-Wake-field, without
seeing the play, has denounced it as immoral.
Well, it teaches no moral, that is true.
Why should it? We are left to hope that a
Reformed Rake will make the best of hus-
bands; and that, by marrying a “bounder”
who is a Professional Palmist, the Female
Liar and her husband are laying up for them-
selves a wretched existence in the not very
distant future. The Elderly Rake, with a
good constitution and a bad past, has the
novelty of a virtuous married life before
him, while the youn !, the Captain,
who, fortunately for him, is discarded by
the vapid Muriel, can look forward to a
life as dissipated as that of Lord Quez, with
the chance of reforming and settling down
comfortably when he reaches that noble-
man's age. It is all mundane; there are
no lofty aims, no attempt at morality until
immorality is played out. No one feels
tempted to go and do likewise. The liar,
seriously taken, is a repulsive character,
celava sans dire; but “the play's the thing,”
and the third act, powerf 8. played as it is,
must draw all London. One thing only is
certain, that The Gay Lord Quez has hit the
E. and has a new lease of a long life
efore him at the Globe. John HARE is
Lord Quez, and Miss IRENE WANBRUGH as
Sapphira (unlimited) is his profit!

seeing the play, has denounced it as immoral.
Well, it teaches no moral, that is true.
Why should it? We are left to hope that a
Reformed Rake will make the best of hus-
bands; and that, by marrying a “bounder”
who is a Professional Palmist, the Female
Liar and her husband are laying up for them-
selves a wretched existence in the not very
distant future. The Elderly Rake, with a
good constitution and a bad past, has the
novelty of a virtuous married life before
him, while the youn , the Captain,
who, fortunately for him, is discarded by
the vapid Muriel, can look forward to a
life as dissipated as that of Lord , with
the chance of reforming and settling down
comfortably when he reaches that noble-
man's age. It is all mundane; there are
no lofty aims, no attempt at morality until
immorality is played out. No, one feels
tempted to go and do likewise. The liar,
seriously taken, is a repulsive character,
celava sans dire; but “the play's the thing,”
and the third act, powerf 3. played as it is,
must draw all London. One #. only is
certain, that The Gay Lord Quez has hit the
ublic and has a new lease of a long life
efore him at the Globe. John HARE is
Lord Quez, and Miss IRENE WANBRUGH as
Sapphira (unlimited) is his profit!
A. H. ON THE C. AND S.
Honouard SIR, -My revered Uncle,
DARBy Jones, has written to me from
Monte Carlo, suggesting that I should take
his place on your esteemed journal, the
while he is enjoying the palm trees and the
lay. His text is the City and Suburban,
§ed of every Licensed Victualler who
ever obtained a Magistrate's License:
Have you, Sir, ever noted the difference
between “the City and Sub.”, and the
Derby? I opine not. Let me then draw
the definition. The C. and S. is a case of
No Favourites, and the D. is a matter of
One Favourite. Every one of our Licensed
Wictuallers has a “dead certainty” (gene-
rally dead) which he collected from the
Brewer's drayman for the º, and Sub.
Every one of our Licensed Victuallers'
Ladies has an excellent surprise for the
Derby, which she obtained from the hand-
some young traveller in Scots whiskey.
A.' now, Sir, to try and do justice to
Uncle DARBy and myself. I have not my
gifted Uncle's method of minstrelsy, but I
venture to chortle–
Look out for the Verdant Galoot,
Of the Beautiful One pray beware,
His Lordship the course will p'raps suit,
And the Lud be a bit of a snare.
But I’m told it’s a ten to one chance
That to beat the Freshport in the dance
Will be Charity bottled in France,
And of Scottish Boy have a great care.
Such, Sir, are my fancies. Yours

tears to the eyes of John G. TALBOT; he

Q: UNDER THE LYGEUM CONVENTION.
RARELY in the annals of the English or
any other stage has there been known a
serious drama with some eighty or ninet
| characters, men, women, and children, º
named in the bill, and all with something,
if only a monosyllabic shout, to say for
themselves. This alone would make M.
VICTORIEN SARDou's Robespierre, written
for Sir HENRY IRVING and his company,
memorable above so many memorable
#. placed on the Lyceum stage by Sir
NRy. Every single person in these
French revolutionary crowds has his or
her distinctive characteristics, and among
the aristocrats imprisoned in the Bastille,
none appeal more forcibly to the tender
sympathies of the audience than the two
little children, bidding farewell to their
parents condemned to the guillotine.
That Sir HENRY has wisely chosen in not
making himself up to facially represent the
cruel Republican tyrant every one wi
agree; is not his nose his own to do as he
likes with it? And if he turns it up at the
idea of converting it into the semblance of
Robespierre's, who shall say him, in French,
nez 2 "In this character, drawn “according
to SARDou,” the actor's genius has had to
represent well nigh every phase of the
strongest human passions; and above all
other difficulties he has had to vividly and
incisively depict the expression and repres-
sion of strong paternal love; while in
another scene, when meeting once again
with the woman whom, years ago, he has
wronged, he has to convey the idea that his
old love is so far resuscitated, that he is
bent on any possible sacrifice to atone for
the past. The great scene in the play is
where Robespierre gradually discovers that
he is on the point of cendemning his own
son to death. This situation is in every
way a triumph for the dramatist and for
the three actors concerned in it, FULLER
MELLISH as Lebas, KYRLE BELLEw as
Olivier, and IRVING as Robespierre. Never
has Sir HENRY played with greater subtlety;
never has he been more powerful.
The other scene that should be next in
dramatic intensity is where Clarisse and
Robespierre feverishly watch the procession
of tumbrils, in order to see if their son is
among the victims being carried to the
sanguinary, insatiable guillotine. On the
first representation Miss TERRY appeared
nervous, and the situation was therefore
comparatively ineffective.
The grim-goblin scene, where any num-
ber of ghosts put in an appearance, is a
mistake. One ghost, a mere shadow, would
have been sufficient, as was Banquo's, for
the guilty conscience. But
“Now they comes by twos and threes,
And now they comes by swarms!”
The more the merrier. But merriment is
not the object of this supernatural vision.
The last scene is in every way a crown-
ing triumph for every department of artistic
stage-craft, and gives us an admirably-con-
trived, and dramatically tragic finish, which
would be perfect but for the French author's
politeness to the representative of his hereine,
who, as the leading actress of the English
stage, could not, ºft any show of dramatic
politeness, be entirely excluded from par-
ticipation in Robespierre's dying agonies.
Why Clarisse and Marie Thérèse should
have been present it is difficult to conceive.
They had obtained , their “passes” for
England, where their lives would have
been safe, while in Paris the revolutionary

This is the only mistake; and it is em-

THE dew was falling fast; the stars began to blink;
I heard a voice; it said, “Drink, pretty creature, drink 1 "
And looking through the gloom, before me I espied
A British merchant with a nigger at his side.
'Twas little Potokoko, a black of beauty rare;
He wore a string of beads and fuzzy-wuzzy hair,
And on his dusky breast, from alcohol to save him,
Was pinned a ribbon blue, a missionary gave him.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE world will have to wait some time for Mr. John MoRLEY's
life of GLADstone... Messrs. CAssell, step in with a volume under
their arms that will in the meanwhile excellently serve. Under
the capable editorship of Sir WEMYss REID the work is accom-
lished upon a new and particularly appropriate plan. Men less
aring, than Mr. MoRLEY have stood aghast at the prospect of,
single-handed, dealing with the manifold evolutions and involu-
tions of a long, busy, and brilliant career. It was peculiarly a
case in which theV. of the syndicate might be adapted to
biography. Sir WEMyss RFID selected some half-dozen men, and
assigned to each a particular aspect of the stupendous work of
which circumstances made him especially famili The result
is a harmonious whole, a chorus to which each trained voice lends
style and force. The volume is profusely illustrated with repro-
ductions of pictures and engravings unattainable in ordinary way.
How such a handsome volume of over 700 pages can be turned
out at the price of 7s.6d. is beyond the usually sufficient com-
prehension of my Baronite.
“Extensive and peculiar" is “the º: of London”
possessed by two co aborating authors, playfully styling them-
selves “Pot" and “Sweaks,” joint authors of The Scarlet City
(SANDs & Co.). These gentlemen are evidently of the ancient Tom
and Jerry family, with, to perfect the trio, one Antony Fuller as
“the Oxonian.” Messrs. Tom and Jerry, juniores, have a pleasant
knack of relating their boyish escapades; and this portion of the
book, though it may be “caviare to the general,” probably be
read with some interest by old Etonians. Contemporaries of
these two scribes may find some amusement in puzzling out the
identity of certain persons, of high and low degree, well known
about town within the last thirty years, who appear on the scene
in disguises furnished them by the light-hearted costumiers of
the House of Pot and Swears. The few dramatic situations are
not as strong as, occasionally, is the language, for which, perhaps,
SweARs is responsible
The proper study of womankind is woman. In Brass (HUTCHIN-
SoN), Miss NELLIE BLISSETT pursues it with bitter avidity. She
has achieved the success of making her heroine about as bad a lot
as is usually turned out from the machine-room of modern novels.
In her (to my Baronite) pleasing view of humanity, she is uncom.
promisingly consistent. "All her women are mean or bad; all her
men are good and noble. Perhaps the Cardinal is no better than
Cardinals should be; but then he is handsome, with exquisite
manner. The opening º: are made a little tiresome b

Steele (John Long). He simply wallows in misery chin
deep. ith a fearful recklessness, he tears the mask from
our conventions and ourselves, and sends us out into the
itiless world stripped of disguise and wretched to the core.
t a tender age Nellie Treherne marries Oswald Steele, a
colossus of bigotry and pigheadedness. After her marriage she
thinks for herself, finds Oswald to be a first-class fraud, and,
leaving her domestic tangle, sets up as a free and independent
woman. She worships the young and beautiful Bernard Danvers,
and nurses him through his last illness. Fortunately, her husband
doesn't turn up until Danvers has been dead a good minute and a
half, thus avoiding a good deal of sentiment and trouble. There
is also a Mr. Culross, a philanthropic free:thinker, who persuades
Nellie to believe with him that marriage without “absolute affinity”
is misery, that most marriages are therefore miserable, and that
men and women who love, and wish to continue loving, had better
not marry. Oswald having obtained a divorce, Culross proves his
firm belief in his dreadful doctrines by proposing to make love to
the divorcée, and the end of the book allows us (though the language
is ambiguous) to hope that they mean to be married and miserable.
Cheer up, EIBBon I fancy you are still a young man, and there's
any amount of fun for you in life if you’ll only take it; you're
hard-working, as a story-teller you have a certain gift for arousing

When I hitched up my bloomers and tightened my belt;

For her axle had split, and the same with her head;

Yet I shouted a “Rightol" and shot up the steep;
For I still had to tackle the best of a league,

THE dew was falling fast; the stars began to blink;
I heard a voice; it said, “Drink, pretty creature, drink 1 "

A British merchant with a nigger at his side.
'Twas little Potokoko, a black of beauty rare;
He wore a string of beads and fuzzy-wuzzy hair,
And on his dusky breast, from alcohol to save him,
Was pinned a ribbon blue, a missionary gave him.

Little Chris (stoutly). All I know is, it was
A MORAL METROPOLIS.
MR. SAMUEL SMITH thinks that the Lon-
don County Council should be the censor
of plays. But why stop there? The Council
cannot be expected to occupyitself only with
mere ordinary municipal matters of paving,
sanitation, lighting, and drinking supply,
of earth, air, fire and water; it must º
other and vaster fields of activity. Let it
control the morals not only of the theatres,
but of the whole metropolis. Let its inspec-
tors be ubiquitous. There are many vices.
There is glutteny. In every one of the
expensive Londen restaurants — in the
cheaper ones such supervision would be
needless—inspectors would be present. As
soon as anyone, º: by the triumphs of
the cook, seemed to have passed the limit
of satisfying his natural hunger, he weuld
be courteously but firmly stopped, and con-
ducted to the door. So also the glutton in
rare wines and choice cigars would be
checked in his immoral attempts to increase
the revenue.
There is pride. There are numbers of
women everywhere in gorgeous clothes, cut
to the latest fashion. They would be at
first warned, and then arrested and fined.
It weuld be decided that the circumference
of every woman's waist should be twice the
circumference of her neck, and that the
heels of her boots should be no higher than
the soles. Of course, only female inspectors
weuld be employed for these duties, unlike
the practice in the present immacral County
Courts, where the judges freely discuss, and
even inspect the details of women's clothing.
There would also be a strict supervision of
men's dress. Coloured neckties, glazed
shirt-collars and white spats would be rigor-
ously forbidden. But pride in other forms
—in houses, equipages, servants, amuse-
ments—would be checked with as firm a
hand. No one would be allewed to occupy
the whole of a house assessed at more than
£100 a year. The meet of the Four-in-Hand
Club weuld only be licensed if each of the
coaches was drawn by two cart-horses.
Liveries for men servants, a degrading badge
of servitude, would be abolished. Club ser-
vants would wear tweed suits. Racing
weuld, of course, be forbidden, and polo
also, except on bicycles. The boxes at the
Opera would be reserved, without payment,
for members of the Council exclusively.
Street organs, far from being abolished,
would be more encouraged even than at
present, since the most rigid moralist could
not consider them luxuries.
There is avarice. Any rich man found in
an omnibus would be forced to take one of
the Council's cabs, and pay sixpence over
the legal taxameter fare.
There is extravagance. Any poor man
found in a cab would be forced to ride in
one of the Council's tramcars, at a farthing
for five miles.
There is gambling. . The games at all
clubs would be limited to chess. draughts.
patience, and beggar-my-neighbour, all
played without money. Marbles would be
strictly forbidden.
And there are other vices. If all were
checked, and gradually abolished, the
metropelis would be absolutely moral.
But, as a beginning, the County Council, or
Parliament, or somebody, might even now
regulate the streets at night so that Mr.
SAMUEL SMITH, or any other decent person,
could walk along Piccadilly without annoy-
ance. Perhaps Mr. SMITH would suggest this.

IT was an ancient wayside inn,
For years left high and dry;
TÉ. thousands on the road would spin,
They always passed it by.
'Twas shanty-like within, without,
The taproom smelt of mould ;
The innkeeper had “poor man's gout,”
And looked a century old.
Another landlord took the place,
An enterprising man;
And soon his custom grew apace,
Due to a simple plan.
Since Beauty by a single hair
Can draw a crowd along,
And Beauty's mere footprints ensnare
The giddy-minded throng,
A pair of female bikes he hired,
nd left outside his door;
No further outlay was required
His fortunes to restore.
The cycling crowd that passed his porch
The coy machines espied;
Dismounting where they used to scorch,
They thought to flirt inside.
They drew a blank; and privily
Each at the next man laughed;
While great was BonifacE's glee,
As they his liquor quaffed.
What matter though but once they came?
The stock of fools is great 1

because they happen to be in charge of
DoN José. For many members this last
circumstance is quite sufficient to impel
to opposition. I believe that if it fell to
DoN José's lot to introduce the millennium
there is a considerable minority in the
House of Commons who would carp at it.”
Something in this, as appears from busi-
ness to-night. First order is the Small
Houses Bill. It is admittedly an improve-
ment on similar measures framed with
identical object. In 1893 such a Bill, intro-
duced by private member, met with chorus
of approval that carried it through second
reading without division. Amongst those
who applauded were right honourable
ſº now seated on Front Opposition
ench. Yet when Don José, turning his
mind from imperial cares to domestic
matters, makes the subject his own, con-
tumely and scorn are poured upon his
benevolent head.
The BLAMELEss BARTLEy, who strongly
supported similar Bill in other i.
suspiciously sniffs at Don José's appear-
ance in this galley. “What,” he asks, “is
the meaning of this remarkable extension
of the Colonial Office 2" As for Don José,
even pathetic resignation this new cross.
Why should his personal connection with
any particular business at home or abroad
ever evoke acrimony? Not as if he were
in the habit of making things uncom-
fortable for other persons. A milder, meeker,

dewy mead. If any one smites him on the
left cheek, swift he turns his right and begs
the assailant to oblige. If one in mistake
takes his coat from his particular peg, he
runs after him with somebody else's cloak,
and beseeches him to take that also.
In the course of official correspondence
with an angered Boer he, regardless of cable
expenses, coos the enquiry, “How is Mrs.
Krüger?” Yet, as we see, when he attempts
to serve humanity by bringing in a harmless
little Bill, it is bitterly assailed, not only
from the Opposition side (that could be
endured), but from friends and companions
dear on the benches near him.
Very strange, quite incomprehensible. The
study of mankind º man may be proper;
it is sometimes puzzling.
Business done.--Night spent in haggling
round Small Houses Bill, which most
speakers agree, in describing as so insignifi.
cant as not to be worth talking about.
Tuesday. — STANLEY LEIGHToN doesn't
often light on a good thing. For the most
art he lives up to character of The Man
rom Shropshire, wittily assigned him years
ago by GEORGE TREVELYAN. . Like that
hapless suitor, his appearance in debate is
hands, some confused remarks, and abrupt
withdrawal. It was on Small Houses B
he made his mark. Not approving it, he
decided to abstain from division, and this is
how he announced his intention:
“The principle of the Bill is dangerous,
and I cannot support it. So I shall follow
the example of an Irish friend, who, in a
§. ull, said he should record his vote
y walking out of the House.”
STANLEY LEIGHToN represents an agricul-
tural district, and should be an authority on
the subject of stock. To others not less well
placed for obtaini information, the kind
alluded to is distinctly novel.
STEADMAN of Stepney, emulous of pre-
eminence of London, not disposed to have
the prize bull carried off by The Man from
Shropshire. Certainly ran him pretty hard
for the first place. London Water Com-
anies Bill under discussion. HARRY SIMEON
AMUEL, member for Limehouse, ventured
to express opinion on subject. STEADMAN
of Stepney gazed with manifest scorn on a
man who, as he said, “lives in the West
End and represents an East End constitu-
ency.”
“Sir," he continued, with a
ſº of wrapping his toga closer round
is corduroys, “I not only represent my
constituency, I live in it, and, Mr. SPEAKER,
I was practically born in it.”
STEADMAN of Stepney stood bewildered
under the flood of laughter that greeted his
remark. When it subsided he condescended
to explanation. “When I say I was prac-
tically born in Stepney, I mean I was born
in an adjacent constituency.”
That made things quite clear, and the
London Water Bill was read a third time.

DoN José. For many members this last
circumstance is quite sufficient to impel
to opposition. I believe that if it fell to
Don José's lot to introduce the millennium
there is a considerable minority in the
House of Commons who would carp at it.”
Something in this, as appears from busi-
ness to-night. First order is the Small
Houses Bill. It is admittedly an improve-
ment on similar measures framed with
identical object. In 1893 such a Bill, intro-
duced by private member, met with chorus
of approval that carried it through second
reading without division. Amongst those
who applauded were right honourable

mind from imperial cares to domestic
matters, makes the subject his own, con-
tumely, and scorn are poured upon his
benevolent head.

supported similar Bill in other i.

In the course of official correspondence
with an angered Boer he, regardless of cable

Krüger?” Yet, as we see, when he attempts
to serve humanity by bringing in a harmless
little Bill, it is bitterly assailed, not only
from the Opposition side (that could be
endured), but from friends and companions
dear on the benches near him.
Very strange, quite incomprehensible. The

how he announced his intention:

given to the Home SECRETARY the names

Friday.—CAwmELL-BANNERMAN did fine
stroke of business for Liberal Party when
he induced HERBERT GLADstons to under-
take duties of Opposition Whip. A perfect
illustration of the happy concatenation of
circumstance sometimes described as fit-
ting the square, peg in, the square hole.
HERBERT has lived through º
trying times, and come out scathless. He
has never trafficked on the heritage of a
great name, has, rather, º tried to
efface himself. His constitutional modesty
has had effect of inducing other people to
on it himself. His father made Markisses,
dukes, and a' that. After long interval, he
made son HERBERT a Junior Lord of the
Treasury. It was only when Mr. G., re-
tired from the scene that his son received
something like recognition of his services
and his talents. As First Commissioner of
Works he started the scheme of improve-
ment in the Parliament Street º:
to Westminster Abbey and the Houses of
Parliament, which his successor is splen-
didly carrying out. That a prettyfair record
for a still young Minister. As Whip, he will
have opportunities for more rapid advance-
ment to Cabinet rank.
Business done.—In Committee of Supply.
HOW TO SETTLE IT.
IT is rumoured that, as the result of
various recent negotiations, a prospectus, of
which the following is a summary, will be
issued at the end of the month. º, List of
Applications will probably be opened on

during that time the share capital will be
applied for many times over.

the very valuable property known as the
Transvaal, and situated in South Africa.
All the necessaries and luxuries of life,
including gold and dust and gold-dust, are
produced in incredible profusion, with the
solitary exception of water, which is at
times scarce. This deficiency is, however,
guarded against by the importation of vast
à. of champagne. It is estimated
that the property, under good management,
will produce a revenue sufficient to pay the
interest on the debentures, and, probably,
a dividend of 75 per cent. on the ordinary
shares, which are therefore issued at a
slight premium.

[“A limited liability company in Yorkshire farms the picturesque, and
charges so much a head for the pleasure of looking at it. . In one instance, it
has acquired a complete monopoly of a wide stretch of beautiful country,
and admission to view cannot be obtained without payment of sixpence.”—
The Globe.]
THE Directors of the Soul-stirring Scenery Company, Limited,
beg to call attention of lovers of the picturesque to the fact that
all the rural beauty of England is now practically under their
exclusive control.
The Welsh mountains, the Lake District, the renowned
coast-scenery of Devon and Cornwall have been acquired by them
and before long they hope to take over the management of
the Hebrides and the Channel Islands. Poets, artists, and
others are therefore recommended to avail themselves of
the º provided by the Company, which can offer them
most delightful views on the most moderate terms.
The charge made varies with the extent and beauty of the view
selected, and an additional fee is necessary for those who desire
sunset or moonlight effects. It is well known that people can only
appreciate those things which they have to pay for, so that this
Company is doing a distinctly educational work. Again, in
many cases it has greatly improved the scenery. Where any
portion of the view appears, uninteresting, the Company has
erected huge advertisement hoardings, designed in the most
cheerful colours, thus improving Nature by Art. Special
arrangements are made, for foreign yisitors, a five-guinea
coupon entitling them to be shown six distinct and well-selected
views in different parts of the country. Railway fares, of course,
have to be paid by the tourist.
In order to safeguard their rights, arrangements have been made
by the Directors that all windows in railway carriages shall for
the future be made of frosted glass, to prevent illegal looking
at the Company's scenery. And it is necessary to add, that
any one attempting even to ſº. at a view belonging to the Com-
pany without payment will be rigorously prosecuted.
Detailed list of views may be had on application. Our Spring
arrangements are now complete, and our trees are showing the
most exquisite tints of green. In a few weeks' time we hope to
supply the music of cuckoos and nightingales in several of our
districts, and, with the help of a phonograph, to continue their
melody throughout the year. It is hoped by means of powerful
electric search-lights to º moonlight effects throughout each
month, and without regard to weather.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TEAR-IN-EYE OF TIERS AT THE
LAUGH-AND-GRY-TEARY-'UN TEAR-TRE.
The Tyranny of Tears, by HADDoN CHAM-
BERs, has achieved an exceptional success:
exceptional because due to the interest
created by an admirably-acted rendering
of a cleverly-written domestic comedy
almost destitute of strong dramatic situa:
tions. Yet the reflecting quality of the small
polished mirror of the stage, held up to
Nature by Mr. H. CHAMBERs and the
comedians of the Criterion, reproduces, with
such slight and necessary exaggeration as
never amounts to distortion, studies from
life, the truth of which will be admitted by
the majority.
In Mr. and Mrs. Parbury on the stage,
Mr. and Mrs. SMITH in the stalls will not,
perhaps, own to recognising themselves;
and though SMITH may see that Mrs. Par-
bury is uncommonly like his better half.
and Mrs. SMITH may observe to herself
that her inferior half might almost have
stood for the model of Parbury, yet they
will agree that at least they both know
more than one couple, say the BRowNs and
the Joneses, closely resembling the Mr.
and Mrs. Parbury of the play.
In drawing these two principal characters.
the dramatist has been most happy: and
fortunate is he, that the presentation of them
to the public is in such able hands as those
of Mr. CHARLEs WYNDHAM and Miss MARY
MooRE. CHARLEs “our friend" is admir-
able; perfectly natural throughout, except
in one little bit, where, in Act III., in his
ialogue with the servant, (a part most
iscreetly rendered by Mr. STANLEY PRIN-
GLE,) Mr. Wyndham, having been momen-
tarily betrayed by the author into the
extravagance of farce, has deliberately
chosen to emphasise the situation. Other-
wise Mr. WYNDHAM's Parbury seems to me
to be as true comedy as is the leading motive
of the piece.
As Mrs. Parbury, the complacent and un-
consciously selfish wife, who, thinking she is
ºf everything for the happiness of both,
has been allowed by the “good easy man”
to have her way in sºft. and so has
become an affectionate domestic tyrant,
the more tyrannical because so greatly
affectionate, Miss MARY MooRE, playing
the part with consummate skill, surpasses
anything she has yet attempted. She is
to poor Parbury what the feather-headed
Dora was to David Copperfield, only with
some years added to their experience of
married life.
Mr. FRED, KERR is at his ease as the
impressionable bachelor, George Gunning,
who poses as a cynic. That he should
suddenly fall in love with the secretary-
type-writing young lady is not improbable;
that he should decide within a few hours
on making her his wife is highly improb-
able; but that Miss Hyacinth Woodward,
the cold-blooded, ambitious, calculating,
highly proper young blue-stocking, one
of a country º: numerous daugh-
ters, employed by Mr. Parbury in the
capacity of typewriter for his novels or
essays (or whatever the mysterious liter
work may be, on which he is *::::.
should as suddenly accept Mr. Gunning's
hand just at the very moment when she
feels inclined to box his ears, is about as
unlikely a thing to happen as that Beatrice
should fº enedick after all their war
of words. Mr. HADDon CHAMBERs may
indeed plead the example set by SHAKSPEARE;
but he will remember that Benedick and
Beatrice are old acquaintances before the
“PLEASE, SIR, TUPPENCE worth of BUTTER SCRAPIN's, AN' MoTHER says BE sure
THEY'RE ALL CLEAN, 'cAUSE she's ExPECTIN' company.”
puts Benedick to the strongest proof of love
that a man can give, in making him chal:
§ his dearest friend at her imperial
bidding. Again, the cool, sharp-tongued,
nasty-tempered Miss Hyacinth cannot for
a moment nor in any way be put in com-
parison with a Beatrice. For this most
ungracious and unsympathetic part a better
exponent could not have been found than
Miss MAUDE MILLETT, who stiffens herself
and hardens her heart in such a convincing
manner as must astonish all playgoers who
remember her in Sweet Lavender and similar
gentle characters.
Mr. ALFRED BISHoP is admirable as the
old Colonel, who, as a widower, has resumed
his former bachelor ways; but his “catch
phrase " of “Give me a word,” is monoto-
mous. And why? ...]" because Mr.
CHAMBERs has made one of his companions
on the stage always ready with the right
word at the right moment; “which,” to
quote Euclid, “is impossible."
The finish of the piece is disappointing.
to bring down the curtain on a roar of
laughter. However, The Tyranny of Tears
has deservedly “caught on," and will reign
despotically at the Criterion for many
months to come.
SPRING-CLEANING.
“In Spring when woods are getting green,”
My wife begins the house to clean,
And I am driven from this scene,
Of scrub-land.
The mops and pails left on the stairs
I come across, quite unawares,
And break my shins and utter-prayers,
For tub-land.
In clouds of dust I choke and cough,
Such draughts! My hat I dare not doff,
I'd go (if I were not a toff)
To pub-land.
But—mum—I won't kick up a shine,
Nor of delight give any sign,
But, quietly, I'm off to dine

play commences, and that finally Beatrice
In Club-land.
There is wanting some effect, some surprise

FINISHING. HOUSEKEEPING,
By A BENEDICT.
(With due apologies to the Careful Matron of the “D. T.”
I will imagine you to be the fortunate occupant of a bright little
bed-sitting-room in Bloomsbury, or better still, the tenant of a
nice two-room bachelor's flat in West Kensington. In the former
event, you will doubtless have the supervision of a landlady and a
share in the services of a lodging-house “general.” to assist you in
the conduct of your little ménage, and in the latter, some outside
help from a charwoman will E. be found necessary; but I
wish, i. far as possible, to show you how you may best help
yourself.
Let us suppose, then, that you are not overburdened with this
world's goods, and have to be content, for the present, with a
modest single room, say on the top floor in a quiet side-street near
the British Museum. taking this apartment, the first thing is
to consider whether it shall be at the front or the back of the
house. If you prefer a certain amount of style, and do not mind
the noise of the traffic, I should recommend §. front; otherwise,
should you be interested in your neighbours' doings and home-life,
and like to count their washing and watch their cats fight, a back
apartment is preferable. In either case, it should not be smaller
than seven feet square, as you will no doubt be anxious, in course
of time, to entertain. Meanwhile, let me help you to get things a
little ship-shape.
As your space is limited, I should advise you to purchase
(second-hand, of course) a fly-up bed, ene of those useful con-
trivances which disappear into a wardrobe or dummy book-case,
on the bascule principle. Similarly, you can obtain, with a little
rummaging in Wardour Street, a combination writing-table and
washstand. When you have finished §". ablutions, you stow
the basin away behind the right-hand false front, which has
handles on it to look like drawers. I have one of these most
convenient pieces of furniture, which ºy belonged to a
Countess, and I cannot think what I should do without it. In
the left-hand compartment you place your brush and comb,
your tooth-mug (if you use such a º, sponge-bag, and other
necessaries. Do not fail to turn the sponge-bag inside out, and
it will then last for years, and the shilling thus, saved can go
partly on tooth-powder and partly on a nice stick of shaving-soap.

of many colours, carrying croziers, and º pastoral staves,
while approaching the QUEEN in that humble spirit in which the
Revd. RICHARD BARHAM represented the Archbishop of Canterbury
at the Coronation as holding “a goulden dish up"—
“For to resave her bounty and great wealth,
Saying, “Plase your Glory, great Queen Wic-tory,
Ye'll give the Clargy lave to dhrink your health.’”
But while the two Princesses in the Royal carriage preserve the
most demure attitude, Her Gracious Majesty is apparently paying
no attention to the gorgeously arrayed ecclesiastics. In one of the

the same situation, not only is Her Gracious Majesty averting her

the Princesses also are imitating the august example.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In The Garden of Swords (CAssell & Co.)|
MAx PEMBERTON gives us three interesting
figures, whose actions the reader with diffi.
culty follows, as they are from time to
time lost to sight, though always to memory
dear, in the surging crowd of warriors,
French and German. In consequence of
the author's vivid and picturesque descrip-
tion of details, it is difficult for the reader,
from the turmoil and pick up the thread of
the narrative. Those who can do this, the
story will repay with interest at not a very
hiº rate.
he Autobiography of a Child (BLAck-
wood) is a pitiful book. My Baronite, un:
reasonably sensitive about titles, has had it
on his table for some time, avoiding it
under the impression that it was one of
those painfully funny things akin to the
History of a Bad Boy and the like. On the
contrary, it is a tragedy unrelieved by touch
of comedy. The anonymous writer looks
back on her childhood from the hilltop of
womanhood, and ruthlessly pictures its
anguish. The child was a little Irish girl
of supersensitive nature, with a fiend of
a mother, who, in only less coarsely brutal
manner, recalls the case of another Irish
mother a year or two ago figuring in the
with her wild nature, her untamed spirits,
her vivid imagination, was what is com.
monly called a handful. If the hand closing
over it had been soft and warm it might
have nurtured a rare flower of maidenhood.
Being bony and bloodless it spoiled a young
life. The worst thing about the book is
that it is evidently a true story.
“The hardy Norseman's house of yore.”
as the Baron's Nautical Retainer reminds
him, “was on the something wave,” but
his particular inland residence was undoubt-
edly Rouen. It was from this riparian
retreat that our first WILLIAM issued to
conquer that country which is still ºft.
in Sark as an appanage of the Channel
Islands. Hence the personal interest felt
by our Anglo-Norman race (sometimes
tºº." as plain Anglo-Saxon,
but actually Norse by descent on East as
well as South, to say nothing of the coast
of what is known as our hinterland bevond
the Tweed) in the history and art of the
capital of Normandy. Like RosTAND's
“cadets de Gascogne,”
“En Normandie a gent molt fiere
Jo ne sai gent de tel maniere;
Chevaliers sont Froz é vaillanz
Par totes terres conquéranz.”
So sang the Rev. Robert WACE, of Jersey,
evil speller, and author of the romances
of Rou and of Brut (trés sec). Mr. THEo-
DoRE ANDREA Cook, who writes vastly
better English, has told us all that any
reasonable man can want 1o know of the
first city of the duchy in his delightful Story
of Rouen, contributed to Messrs. DENT's
series of Mediaeval Towns. This is your
true Cook to conduct you on your next
visit to Normandy. Nothing in old Rouen
has escaped his careful eye, from the Tour
Jeanne d'Arc to the elaborate details of the
reliefs on the Maison Bourghteroulde, which
may Heaven, aided by the local authorities
and M. le Ministre des Beaux Arts, long
preserve. Into yº. pocket you may slip
this chastest of volumes, which, for its
erudition, its charming vivacity of style,
and its most excellent illustrations, deserves
a train de luze to itself.
There are, writes one of the Baron's
Retainers, 320 closely-packed pages of print
and any number of incidents in Forbidden
Banns (F. W. WHITE & Co.); by ANNABEL
GRAY. Rosamund is a lady who indulges in
marriage as some people indulge in drink
or golf. She is never happy without it.
Her first husband is a ne'er-do-well who
abandons his Yº..."; wife, and is imme-
diately reported to have been drowned off
South America—I cannot remember the
exact locality, but this is near enough.
Then the Faithful Old Lover who has been
waiting, oh, so patiently, turns up, and
Rosamund marries him. After some happy
years the F.O.L. is disposed of by a wily
old Major, who bribes the F.O.L.'s horse
with a heavy bribe of beans and oats to
assassinate his master. The horse suc-
cumbs to the temptation, the F. O. L. is
duly slain, and then Rosamund marries the
Major. Upon this the undrowned ne'er-
do-well pops up again; and Rosamund, tired
of marriage, tries death by way of a change.
I don't know why ANNABEL GRAY should
invent a war between France and Germany.
By doing, so she distinctly infringes the
patent of Mr. LE QUEUx, the gay LE
$.". whose stories of imaginary blood-
shed and battle so greatly fascinate us.
However, I let that pass, and conclude by

time lost to sight, though always to memory anguish. The child was a little Irish girl
dear, in the surging crowd of warriors, of supersensitive nature, with a fiend of

her vivid imagination, was what is com.
monly called a handful. If the hand closing
over it had been soft and warm, it might
have nurtured a rare flower of maidenhood.
Being bony and bloodless it spoiled a young
life. The worst thing about the book is
that it is evidently a true story.
“The hardy Norseman's house of yore.”
as the Baron's Nautical Retainer reminds
him, “was on the something wave,” but
his particular inland residence was undoubt-
edly Rouen. It was from this riparian
retreat that our first WILLIAM issued to
conquer that country which is still regarded
in Sark as an appanage of the Channel
Islands. Hence the personal interest felt
by our Anglo-Norman race (sometimes
tºº." as plain Anglo-Saxon,
but actually Norse by descent on East as
well as South, to say nothing of the coast
of what is known as our hinterland bevond
the Tweed) in the history_and art of the
capital of Normandy. Like RosTAND's
“cadets de Gascogne,”
“En Normandie a gent molt fiere
Jonesai gent detel maniere;
Chevaliers sont Froz é vaillanz
Par totes terres conquéranz.”
So sang the Rev. Robert WACE, of Jersey,
evil speller, and author of the romances
of Rou, and of Brut (trés sec). Mr. THEo-
DoRE ANDREA Cook, who writes vastly
better English, has told us all that any
reasonable man can want to know of the
first city of the duchy in his delightful Story
of Rouen, contributed to Messrs. DENT's
series of Mediaeval Towns. This is your
true Cook to conduct you on your next
yisit to Normandy. Nothing in old Rouen
has escaped his careful eye, from the Tour
Jeanne d'Arc to the elaborate details of the
reliefs on the Maison Bourghteroulde, which
may Heaven, aided by the local authorities
and M. le Ministre des Beaux Arts, long
preserve. Into yº. pocket you may slip
this chastest of volumes, which, for its
erudition, its charming vivacity of style,
and its most excellent illustrations, deserves
a train de luze to itself.
There are, writes one of the Baron's
Retainers, 320 closely-packed pages of print
and any number of incidents in Forbidden
Banns (F. W. WHITE & Co.); by ANNABEL
GRAY. Rosamund is a lady who indulges in
marriage as some people indulge in drink
or golf. She is never happy without it.
Her first husband is a ne'er-do-well who
abandons his young wife, and is imme-
diately reported to have been drowned off
South America—I cannot remember the
exact locality, but this is near enough.
Then the Faithful Old Lover who has been
waiting, oh, so patiently, turns up, and
Rosamund marries him. After some happy
years the F.O.L. is disposed of by a wily
old Major, who bribes the F.O.L.'s horse
with a heavy bribe of beans and oats to
assassinate his master. The horse suc-
cumbs to the temptation, the F. O. L. is
duly slain, and then Rosamund marries the
Major. Upon this the undrowned ne'er-
do-well pops up again; and Rosamund, tired
of marriage, tries death by way of a change.
I don't know why ANNABEL GRAY should
invent a war between France and Germany.
By doing, so she distinctly infringes the
patent of Mr. LE QUEUx, the gay LE
$.". whose stories of imaginary blood-
shed and battle so greatly fascinate us.
However, I let that pass, and conclude by
tendering to ANNABEL GRAY my acknow-
ledgments for a book which, unequal as it is,
yet possesses elements of skill and interest.

beginning with Lord REAY, ending with
KIMBERLEY. House nearly empty; solemn
stillness steeped the scene. e Dook,

It was his heroic self-denying ordinance
about not yawning that wrecked him. If,

frankly yielded it would have been much
better. The repression had effect analogous
to that of suppressed gout. The Bishops

So Johnston of Ballykilbeg, overlooking
minor matters, rises on this the three hun-

perform an act of homage. He had on
paper a question addressed to Chief Com-
missioner of Works, inquiring after the

So Johnston of Ballykilbeg, overlooking
minor matters, rises on this the three hun-

perform an act of homage. He had on
paper a question addressed to Chief Com-

“Order I rder!” Plainly no use at-

howls ceased, Chieftain quietly went on—
“I desire to ask the Chief Commissioner of
Works the question that stands in my
name.”
Thus swiftly, he dropped from poetry to
prose. A quaint anti-climax; but he was
now strictly in order, none daring to make
him afraid as he recited the terms of his
question. The House delights in Johnston

of April 22. Behold ! The #. Senate
has discussed the “decoration” of the
Cathedral of London, and one of the sena-
tors, the Count of WEMIs, has read my poor
letter, the humble opinion of a foreigner,
to the Senate of your great country. ven
to you, Mr. PUNCH, that is without doubt
considered a mere joker—wn burlone. But
to me it is more wonderful that the illus-
trious Senate of the great English nation
should listen gravely to the criticism of an
obscure stranger, even when published in
your magnificent journal. I thought that
your senators understood only the chase or
the races, and knew nothing of the Fine
Arts. But no l I am so proud of the
honour that henceforth I shall cause my
cards to be printed in English—
LEONARDo TIZIANo BUoNARRoTI

Since my return to Italy I have seen also
some other English newspapers, and I know
who are the leaders of English art. There
is a guardia municipale named Jones, there
S. PEPys, who wrote a letter to you after I
had done so. His English was very curious.
Perhaps he is also an American, or a police-
man. "But not one of these has had the
honour of addressing the Senate. Diavolo 1
I am “a tremendous swell,” as you say in
England.
It is possible that some day I may become
an English Commendatore. Is the adviser
of your Senate thus rewarded ?_Or do you
think, Mr. PUNCH, that your Senate will
deprive the Commendatore RICHMOND of
his title and bestow it upon me? It would
be a very just and graceful act.

voice of infinite weariness began to reply to

It was his heroic self-denying ordinance
about not yawning that wrecked him. . If,
when impulse came upon him, he had
frankly yielded it would have been much
better. The repression had effect analogous
to that of suppressed gout. The Bishops
bore up bravely. They are, of course, in
good training. Occasionally deliver Charges

suffered Charges from others.

Ministerial bench. He dexterously fixed
his mailed fists on the bench so as to
support his body, bent his massive head on

most of the new Street Industrial Com-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
(From Mr. Punch's Vagrant.)
To MR. ALFRED AUSTIN.
RESPECTED LAUREATE,--It was my fortune many years ago to be
present at a cheerful gathering of men of the world, journalists,
and other good fellows. There had been a plentiful flow of soul,
and the stories had been as fº. as the company, but at a late
stage of the proceedings, as I remember, we all fell under the
thraldom of a certain past master in the business of high-spirited
badinage. He rollicked on to right and to left while the rest
pondered too late ...”. the repartees they might have directed
against him. Finally our humourist turned upon a quiet and
inoffensive gentleman with a burst of exuberant patronage and
said, “Never mind, old man, we can't all be funny, can we ?”
“No,” retorted the quiet man, “we can't, that's very true; but
some of us try very hard, don't we ?”
The application of this anecdote to you, oh, my Laureate, is not,
perhaps, of that obviousness which we have been told Nature and
Sir WALTER Besant have exhausted. But I have read your latest
effusion in the Standard, and in my yº. fancy I see you
oetizing away for all you are worth at the heads, let us say, of
Mr. Ruby ARD KIPLINg and Mr. WILLIAM WATson. “Never mind,
RUDYARD, old man,” I can hear you say, “we can't all write
oetry, can we ?” “No, ALFRED, we can't, but some of us try very
É. don't we ?”
After all, it is something to have tried and to keep on § I
know many men, solid, amiable, and distinguished, who have
reached a iº. old age without ever having versified. Con-
sider their wretched state: they have never set themselves to the
task of chopping sentences into lengths; they have never scanned;
they have never counted syllables; they have never, Heaven help
them, rhymed. What do they know of joy who have never, for
instance, fixed the word “Heaven” at the end of a stanza, and
have not discovered after running through the º that
“leaven” is the best admissible rhyme to it? And the august
delight of fixing “leaven” in, of making it, in spite of itself, fit
your intentions, of seeing “celestial sunset fires That lift us from
this earthly leaven” (how many foot pounds had the particular
celestial sunset fire, the flaming solar yeast, that lifted you, oh,
my poet and pride?) and, so proceeding till you wind up...the
stanza and clamp on the predestined rhyme with “darkly silent
cypress spires” (surely you didn't †: them to be brightly
#ing º “pointing the way from hill to Heaven.” These joys
and that delight have been yours. For you are a singer, and if
any envious linnet should ask you how you sing, you are entitled
to †. that you sing after your own fashion, and leave linnets
and fºsnysons and Kirings and Wºrsons to follow theirs.
And now let us have a little chat about. The City of Flowers,
which eloquently illuminated the darkly silent columns of the
Standard on the 28th of April. It is a long pome—forgive the
word; it is suggested by your own compression of poet, metri
gratid, into pote in the third stanza—and out of the twenty-three
stanzas I cannot make anything but a paltry selection of beauties.
I wished to do this last week, but the fates and your own thought-
lessness prevented me. Your #". appeared on a Friday, and by
the time I had roused myself from the ecstasy into which its
erusal had plunged me, and had seized the eulogistic pen-holder,
o! it was too late to write for publication in the ensuing number
of this journal. May I beg you for the future not to publish any-
thing later in the week than Thursday?
However, to my task. It shocks me to think how terribly old
we are all getting. Since the year 1861, as you justly and beauti-
fully remark, “Nigh on eight lustres now have flown” (they had
to fly instead of running or walking or passing because they were
going to rhyme with “zone"). In 1861 I was alive, and you were
already a pote. In 1861 RUDYARD KIPLING was still unborn, and a
thousand other things that have happened since had not been thought
of. It's a long period, and the thought of it irresistibly makes a man
turn his # to his latter end, nearer to him by nigh on eight
lustres than when first with trembling heart you came to Florence.
But why all this parade of the phenomena of Nature and your own
fancy that attended your first coming to the City of Flowers?
The season, it seems, was purple-sweet, figs were a-plucking, and
apes a-pressing, a dead Pote was being borne (see note) to Santa
roce, and the folk who walked after the deceased did so—how
otherwise were they to do it?—with following feet. And Florence
flung her gates ajar and gently led you by the hand, and became
“more than a foster nurse" to you (positive, fost; comparative,
foster; superlative, fostest;) but in spite of all Florence's tempta-
tions, you still remain devoted to Albion's crags and cradling sea—
which is enormously gratifying and highly patriotic on your part.

Don't worry, ALERFD; it's pure fancy, nothing more; as
visionary and impossible as your use of the word “lain”—which
I must admit to be pretty steep for a laureate. But, after all, who
cares? My beautiful feelings are very important to me; yours
are no doubt essential to your own well-being; but I assure you
nobody else cares a rap about them. I don't wish to offend you,
but I cannot help thinking that you are becoming just a little
morbid about yourself and your fancies and your recollections of
lap and love, and the unloving ones who live in spite of their own
perpetual jarring (see how carefully I expound you to the general).

So sit and sing it, if you please,
Sing it, my ALICE, while I lean
Backward against your brawny knees,
Beside the mown grass freshly green;
The old sweet scent assails my nose
Here where I nursed those early hopes,
Watching you whack my helpless slows
Far-humming to the rounded ropes.
“It is the Vicar's daughter,
And her arm has grown so stout
That I would be the willow
With which she swipes about;
And I would hardly wince a bit
Although I ultimately split.
“And I would be the bulwark
Upon her stalwart, stalwart shin,
And all day long to shield her
While her eye was getting in ;
And help her not to feel too sore
When obviously “limb before.”
“And I would be the gauntlet
Upon her fairy finger-tips,
To guard her knotted knuckles
When steering through the slips;
And bear the language of my love "
When people bowled her off her
glove.
“Is she the demon trundler?
I'd be the bounding, bounding
sphere,
Flung high and hard at random
About the batsman's ear;
And I would throb with happy throes,
Letting her pitch me §. she
chose.
A trifle, but the best I could l
Not tricked, I own, with gawds of art ;
But you, you found the matter good
As coming solid from the heart;
Nor would you keep me long in doubt,
Nor deem my homage overbold,
Though scores of fifty-five, not out,
Leave many a woman proud and cold.
But, ALICE, what an hour was that,
My hour of ventilated vows,
When, beaten thrice, I lost a hat,
And won a really splendid spouse !
So sing that other which relates
How, half in pity; half in pride,
You undertook, with choice of dates,
To be my own, my blooming bride.
“Love that bowls us at the net
Just as we are nicely set,
Shall he shoot and we regret 2
Shall we lose our shirt and fret,
Or proceed to claim a let 2

Though our eyes be wringing wet,
Though our stumps be all upset
Thrice consecutively, yet

Lady Agatha, “I KNow It 's A GREAT DEAL to AsK, MR.
DAUBENEY, BUT would YoU, some DAY, GIVE ME on E of YoUR
PICTUREs For AN INSTITUTION I AM so DEEPLY INTERESTED IN ?
It Is A Home of REST For THE BLIND !”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Death that Lurks Unseen, by J. S. FLETCHER (FISHER,
UNwin & Co.). Ughl There's a creepy-crawly title for you!
But do not be afeared; do not be repelled by the hideous cover,
but boldly face it and take the Baron's advice—read it. The
volume consists of nine short stories, of which, all being readable,
the first three are the best, and the first of all out and away the
best of the lot. In fact, the plot of the story from which the book
as a collection takes its title, would, had it been thoughtfully
developed, have given ample material for a one volume novel. No
matter, the story as it is, is good and capitally told.------
The Baron would recommend, by .# of a strong sensation,
BERTRAM, MITFoRD's The Weird of Deadly Hollow (F. W. WHITE
& Co.). It is a grim tragedy, the gleams of light humour being
few and far between. But as a tale of crime and deadly, merciless
vengeance it is horribly fascinating, and—not a story to be for-
gotten in a hurry. THE BARON DE B.-W.
A CorrecTIon.—At the Birmingham Dramatic and Literary
Club dinner given on the occasion of the SHAkspeaRE Commemo-
ration, Mr. SIDNEY LEE, the guest of the Club and of the evening,
in the course of an interesting speech, is reported to have repeated
a story about Poet BRowNING having seen THACKERAY and
WIDDIcomb, “the clown at Astley's,” pass down the street
§. and how WIDDIcomb was recognised by the passers-by,
who appeared utterly ignorant of the personality of THACKERAY.
First of all, WIDDIcomb held a unique position, not as clown, but
as “Master of the Ring,” and in this capacity he wore a peculiar
sort of uniform. He appeared every night, and as every one, man,
woman, and child, went to Astley's, and as WIDDIcomb was
perpetually being written about and caricatured, it was highly
probable that Londoners, and even country cousins, for no one
came to town without visiting “HAsHLEY's,” would be even more
familiar with the personal appearance of WIDDIcomb than with
that of Lord BRough AM, or even of F.M. the Duke of WELLING-
Ton. That they should not have recognised THACKERAY is natural
enough. It was not his métier to show himself in public. He
had not to appear every night in a circus, his hair and moustache
d la Joinville, and attired in marvellous costume, somewhat
resembling the uniform of a French naval officer, only finished off
with the turn-down collar of a fourteen-year-old schoolboy.
Had THACKERAY adopted this eccentric style, and, so attired,
paraded the town or appeared nightly in a circus holding colloquies
with the clown in the ring, he might have rivalled WIDDIgomb
as a popular personage, and have been recognised and acclaimed
by Londoners and country cousins.
“HOW TO END OUR NOVELS.”

I care not for the letters black
That savour of the ages dead,
Nor for the bindings new that smack
Of posters and the Bodley Head.
All first editions I consign,
With authorship and all its seed,
To–regions more or less benign—
Two books supply my every need.
These teach a man to live at home,
And how to travel (with the price),
Where in the West the cocktails foam,
What he should pay for “slings” and ice.
In East or West a man is told
Where to put up for preference—
Such useful hints are cheaply sold
In manuals of reference.

“BAR, BAR, WHITE SBEEP—ALAS!
WITHOUT WOOL,”
SIR-At the recent general meeting of
the Bar, the larger portion of the proceedings
was taken up by the consideration of the
financial condition of the Barristers' Bene-
volent Association, an institution which has
always been of fascinating interest to me. It
would appear that this excellent charity is
sadlyinneed of funds, and there was a general
expression of opinion that something should

there is an objection to a direct appeal to
the public, but cannot this sentiment be
carried too far? Surely if an entertainment
could be organised by the members of the
Bar, there would be nothing infra dig.
in accepting a small fee for admission.
Not so very long ago, The Maske of
Flowers (originally produced at Gray's
Inn) was played in the Hall of the Inner
Temple (a distinguished practising barrister
having acce j the responsibilities of
licenseeship for that solitary occasion) in
aid of a convalescent home. Could not
something of the same sort be again at-
tempted? There might be a variety enter-
tainment. The Lord Chancellor is noted
for his swordsmanship, and might try con-
clusions with a well known I. Justice of
*ś who is also accustomed to the mask
and foils. Then the Lord Chief Justice, as
a Past President of the Two Pins Club,
might give a display of noble horsemanship.
The talented ballet from The Maske of
Flowers, whose pavane, moresco, and other
quaint dances were the talk of the town
half a dozen years ago, might repeat their
graceful and gracious evolutions. Sir
EDWARD CLARKE–who has a singing face—
might provide a little harmony, and the
Attorney-General, as an athlete, some feats
of strength. Many other “turns” will
occur to barristers cognisant of the capabili-
ties of their colleagues. Lastly, should it
be deemed advisable to send the audience
home, in a good, temper, and with rapid
despatch, I would willingly give a reading
from my own poor works. # have known
an audience counted by the thousand dis-
persed in a couple of minutes with this
finale.
I hope you will give the matter your
immediate attention and most strenuous
support. (Signed) A. BRIEFLEss, Jun.

THE SPORT OF THE FUTURE.
[“The lawns that were erstwhile cumbered with
tennis nets now bristle with croquet hoops, and the
sedate mallet has driven out the frisky racquet.”—
The World.]
WELCoME, Reason, on the scene,
Milder influences reviving !
Far too long have pastimes been
Senseless, useless, arduous striving,
Brutalising men of strength,
Dangerous to those who lack it:
Lo! it speaks their doom at length—
The decadence of the racket.
Purged from customs fierce and rude
Soon shall sports become more gentle,
(As the grosser kinds of food
Yield the palm to bean and lentil,)
Roller skates long since are “off,”
Tennis is no longer O.K.,
Rivals threaten even golf,
As the fashion sets for croquet.
Hence, then, cricket, young and vain,
Football, fraught with brutal bustle,
You at Reason's light shall wane—
Modern upstart cult of muscle;
So may purer tastes begin
All our fiercer games refining,
Till, when spelicans come in,
I may get a chance of shining.

I HAVE come to the conclusion that I want
to be a millionaire. There is, of course,
nothing original in this desire: millions of
men before me have had the same wish,
and some of them have gone so far as to
gratify it. They have been urged on to
their desperate deeds chiefly, no doubt, by
the mere desire for money in the first place,
and secondly by the force of habit which
has driven them submissively along the
money-making road when once they had
got fairly started upon it. But I do not
want to become a millionaire gradually:
the mere process of acquiring sovereigns,
bank-notes, bonds, stock, scrip, balances,
companies, manufactories, parasites, butlers,
houses, pictures, carpets, statues, and news-
papers, has no attraction for me. At the
end, on finding myself in full possession of
all these luxuries, I should probably find
myself a doddering veteran with no power
left to me of enjoying even the adulation of
a stock - jobber. No ; I want to be a
millionaire now, while I am still vigorous

A' NEVER THOUGHT To GET A FALL with My FREE-wHEEL.”
ALLoo ME to TELL YE, FRIEND, YERE THEology's As BAD As YERE RIDING !”
A THOROUGHBRED.
After “A Double Thread" (by the author of “Concerning Isabel
Carnaby”).
“Nothing in a woman, my dear ETHELFRIDA, betrays such
lack of social savoir faire as the habit of telling fibs,” said Lady
WolverHAMPton. , “No sensible man ever believes that a woman
means what she says; and that makes it so much safer to tell the
truth. That's how I married WolverHAMPTON. I told him I
had never cared for any man, and he at once became jealous—as I
meant he should. If a woman ever becomes a bishop-elect it will
be quite useless for her to say, ‘Non volo episcopare.’”
9. your ladyship's leave, is it not “Nolo episcopari'?” said
Lord BATHBRick.
“If you were not a man, BATHBRIck,” replied Lady Wolve R-
HAMPTöN, “you would know that knowledge of the Classics is
such bad form in a woman; almost like working for your living.
But, talking of the sexes, I wonder, ETHELFRIDA, that you have
never married any one. It seems such an oversight ; the sort of
thing that is inexcusable in a well-bred girl.”
The heiress, turned a cynical eye upon her visitor. “It
would be worth while to be a beggar-maid,” she said, “if one
could make sure of being taken in to dinner by CoPHETUA. As it
is, I am modest enough to believe that my money is the only
reason for my popularity.”
“And a very good reason too, my dear,” said Lady WolveR-
HAMPton, “if you must have one; though there is nothing so
unreasonable as a good reason. No man ever yet married a
woman for herself, seeing that he could have no possible means of
knowing what her actual self was like. They marry us for our
hair, or our faces, or the virtues they think we have, or the money
“But I thought, dear lady,” interrupted Lord BATHERick,
“that you always said your husband married you for yourself.”
“There you are wrong, BATHBRICK. It was I who married him.
I got quite a respect for him through never noticing him when he
was there, or being able to remember what he was like when he
was away. . An excellent test of good style. Your well-bred
person should have no manners; none, at least, perceptible to the
eye. Just as when you ask a man what sort of gown a woman
was wearing at a ball, it has always escaped his notice, unless it
was either overdone or underdone. And that reminds me that I
could never see either sense or grammar in the saying, Manners
maketh man. Man is born that way, he isn't made.'
“Non fit, in fact,” suggested Lord BATHBRICK.
“I can't imagine, my dear ADELINE,” said ETHELFRIDA, with her
slight nasal drawl, “how you contrive to say all those clever
things on the spur of the moment. How do you do it? I'm
always trying.”
“Don’t be satirical, my dear,” said Lady Wolve RHAMPTon; “it
is bad manners, and doesn't suit your child-like cast of coun-
tenance. The thing is so simple that it is naturally inexplicable.
I just jot down these little jeux d'esprit as I work them out in
bed, or at church, or when WolverHAMPton is talking to me; and
then I run through them before paying calls or receiving people.
No impromptu ever has a true air of spontaneity unless it has
been “made at leisure.’”
“A most original paradox, my lady,” said Lord BATHBRICK.
“I wish, BATHBRICK, you would not keep on throwing my title in
my teeth,” said Lady WolverHAMPTon. “Such things are taken
for granted and never mentioned among well-bred people. They
ought to resemble the abstract noun in the definition of the sm
board-school girl: ‘An abstract noun is a thing that every one
knows of but nobody talks about—like Mary's leg.” As for paradoxes,












of which they are quite certain. And none of these, not even our
hair, is an essential part of our permanent selves.”
I begin to fear their mode is passed; the latest piquancy is onl
to be found in truisms. Nowadays, if you say in the good .

fashioned manner, ‘Charity is the one unpardonable sin,” nobody
pretends not to understand you; whereas if you say, ‘There is
nothing so essentially feminine as a woman,' people suspect a
hidden meaning and try to conceal their uncomfortableness.”
“But how do you manage,” asked ETHELFRIDA, “to run off all
these †. in the course of a conversation without any appa-
rent solution of logical continuity?”
“Tact, my dear, tact. To absorb the conversation yourself is a
sign of ill-breeding; nice people reach the same result by ignoring
interruption; or, what is better still, and corresponds to the sleight-
of-hand by which a card is forced, you compel the others involun-
tarily to lead up to your next remark. This is easy enough in books
where the author has it all his own way; but in real life it requires
tact, as I just now observed.”
“But suppose you found yourself conversing with somebody
possessed o ...' tact?” asked ETHELFRIDA, with that slight air
of ennui which is characteristic of spoilt women of the world.
“I never do,” said Lady WolyERHAMPtoN, “It would be too
tiresome sitting there like a Christy Minstrel with a black face
saying funny things in your turn.”
“Yes,” said Lord BATHBRIck, “and beginning every time with
“That reminds me of a story.’”
“I know: and it never really does remind them. What they
mean is, “Your stupid interruption nearly put my next good story
out of my head. It was about, &c.’”
“I wonder,” said ETHELFRIDA, with a touch of bitterness
at the thin end of her tongue, “that you have never written a
book. It would be so very clever.”
“My dear,” said Lady WolvKRHAMPTon: “I can't afford to do
it. It would be like killing the goose that lays the oof. Besides,
it might have a vulgar success; and that would be so tiresqme:
And then I could never manage the plot. You see, well-bred
people hardly everhave plots in their lives. The very word always
makes me think of a kitchen garden in a pauper's allotment. "I
once had an idea about a girl like yourself, blest with all the good
things of life, incluing a pretty face and a long tongue, with
which she lashed every lover whom she suspected of wanting her
money. But at last the real Dan Cupid, as she called him, came
her way. He was quite a nice boy, and sound on vaccination
and that sort of thing, but he fought shy of her money and her
long tongue. She had never been in love before, and she was
much too clever to understand how so easy a thing is done... So
she thought she would get a testimonial of his honesty, as if he
were applying for a place as butler.”
“Or cook?” suggested Lord BATHBRICK.
“Or cook, as you say. But don't interrupt me, BATHBRick.
Well, she gave out that she had a destitute twin sister,
hoplessly estranged, and no better than she should be. This twin
was the speaking image of her, only dressed dowdily, and with her
hair done just anyhow. And the nice boy met the penniless girl
and fell in love with her. Twin No. 1 had only got to frumple her
hair, put on a misfit and shorten her tongue, and she was trans-
formed, as by magic, into twin No. 2.; and the nice boy would
never have found out that there was only one of them, if she had
not confessed. And then he was sick to death at the trick and
said she was no gentlewoman, You know how touchy men are
on these ridiculously trivial points of honour.”
“Yes, I know,” said ETHELFRIDA; “whereas you, dear, would
consider that you had been untrue to your feminine instincts if
any man suspected you of having scruples.”
}. WolverHAMPTon took a short breath abstractedly.
“Well,” she continued, “theſº apologised; which, of course,
no womanly girl would ever do; with the result that he ran
away and went on with being a soldier somewhere in India.
Oh, of course she got him back all right in the last chapter;
but the whole thing was too absurd for words. Not that that
matters, much with the , public : , they forgiye an improbably
stupid plot, if only the ºf is #1. clever; which mine
was. But, as I said, I found I could not afford to publish all my
best epigrams, with "Fº to match. And that reminds me
that I must be off, as I have some people to dinner, and there is
a new phrase-book to run through. Good-bye, my dear; so many
thanks for your charming conversation. Come along, BATHBRick.”
OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday, May 8.-House crammed. It is the opening night.
Lohengrin. H.R.H. present and all the Directors. Everybody
pleased with themselyes, performance, and with everybody else.
Chorus perhaps a little unsatisfactory, but principals first-rate.
A charmingly sympathetic Elsa (a débutante with a future before
her), and the great Hungarian tenor in fine form and in perfect
voice. Lohengrin always popular. Good commencement.
“I’M GoING to THE FLAREUps' ‘At Home” to-MoRRow NIGHT.”
“Why, ALL THE NoboDIEs of LoNDoN go THERE!”
“HAve You BEEN YET, DEAR }"
orchestra not noticeable, but one of them must have got round to
the front—a trumpet perhaps playing blasts of its own accord—as
there was an “eager and a nipping air”—a courant d'air-about
the installed legs. Whence?. It was an ill wind that blew no
particular good to any one, as it had blown away Royalty and left
only a few of the swell regulars and regular swells, also Sir
CHARLEs. HALL-there-when-the-bell-rings in the Omnibus, with
i. MANCINELLI as conductor. Strange how the once fresh
delights of Cavalleria Rusticana begin to pall upon one, or two,
or more for the matter of that. Herr DIPPEL, as Turiddu (name
always sounding like commencement of comic chorus and be.
longing to a character who ought to be opposed to Tolderol), was
much and deservedly applauded. Mme. Louise HoMER-Sweet:
Homer was a fascinating Lola, and Mlle. STRAkosch a good
Santuzza. But . . . . alas! . . . . For O, For Ol Cavalleria is
under ordinary circumstances played out; and so is Pagliacci.
Miss MacDonald was a captivating. Nedda;... but whether her
voice can “carry over,” as they say in the City, as far as it is
wanted to go in Covent Garden, is questionable.
Wednesday.-A BIZET night. Carmen. ZELIE DE LUssan better
than ever, and, take her for all in all, it is doubtful whether, in
this particular rôle, we shall ever look upon or hear her like again.
A good performance altogether, especially the Escamillo of Mons.
ALBERs, who sang and acted spleniidly.
Thursday–There's an improvement in the stageing and lighting,
§§ it needs a good deal of the very best electricity to lighten
the Wagnerian Tristan und Isolde. uch enlightenment every
way is necess Herr MoTTL conducted; and JEAN DE REszke
sang and acted Tristan excellently well. Herr WAN. Rooy was
Kurwenal, which sounds like the name of a low bred dog of cha
who is at the service of the highest bidder, a Cur-venal. #.
enter Wagnerian policeman in search of pun-maker. Exit with:
out finding him. "We breathe again!) Herr PRINGLE good, and
Mme. LITVINNE as Isolde makes a most decided hit. How is her
name pronounced? WAGGY says “Lit-vinne” is “Light wine,”
but this we venture to doubt.
Friday.—Good old Faust to finish the week. So the first syndi-
cate season of the Opera, commences well, but nothing very
startling up to now. “A time will come,” and a time too when


Tuesday.—Absence of any particular wind instrument from
Warbling WAGNER has Wanished.

MEssRs. JAMEs and HoRACE, of the great English SMITH family,
distinguished themselves from other SMITHs by writing a volume
of such really wonderful parodies as has secured the duration of
the SMITH Brothers' fame beyond the period ordinarily considered
in the history of literature as “immortality.” Excepting this
solitary achievement there is very little that is really noteworthy
in their pleasantly-written and very readable biography by
Mr. BEAvAN (HURST AND BLACKETT).
“FRANK died quite conscious and quite, quite free from anxiety
tº he left me with two º children, and one unborn, and
very little money and no friends.” Here, in a sentence, we have,
my Baronite says, the keynote of the Life of Mrs. Oliphant,
edited by Mrs. HARRY CoGHILL, published by BLAckwood. FRANK
was Mrs. OLIPHANT's husband. º of the taint of consump-
tion, he married a hapless girl, and had three children, who after
worrying the mother almost to death, died of the hereditary
disease. If a man were to, inevitably if not deliberately, encompass
the death of three innocent children by other means, he might
be hanged. But the law has no provision for this not uncommon
case. As for Mrs. OLIPHANT, she slaved daily, “keeping” every-
body, including two worthless sons, whom she pinched herself to
send first to Eton, then to Oxford. The book has not the liter
value of the Lives earlier published of some of Mrs. OLIPHANT's
compeers. She went very little into society, had no interesti
circle of correspondents, and her own letters are chiefly filled wit
more or less pleasing incidents connected, with the infancy and
boyhood of “my TIDDY,” and “my CEcco.” Others are addressed
to her publishers, urging the need of money to keep this dreadful
family going. Incidentally these latter reveal the true-heartedness
and generosity of the BLAckwoods, brought out in fuller detail in
Mrs. OLIPHANT's history of the House. “Whatever record leaps
to light they never can be shamed.” Mrs. Coghill has, doubtless,
done the best with the means at her disposal. But whilst the
works, it has one all its own in telling the story of a patient,
courageous woman's life. In all her novels, Mrs. OLIPHANT has not
revealed so sad a human story as is set forth in the chapters of
| autobiography that preface the collection of Letters.
A delightful old-world flavour, compounded of Scotch sea-
captains, prim domesticity, quilts, presses, napery, and innocent
simplicity was wafted about me when I made the acquaintance of
Miss Nanse (author, SARAH TYTLER, publisher, John LoNg).
Soon, however, the simplicity and the innocence were disturbed
by the appearance on the scene of a gorgeous little Indian princess,
married to a brutal Scot, who cruelly ill-treats her. Her short,
A.º. life moves one to .. for her, to hatred of her husband.
Also there appear two nabobs back from India, the coarse brothers
of Miss Nanse and Miss Matty. But I have no space to do more
than say that the story is interesting and delightful, abounding in
unforced humour and knowledge of human nature. It is a
pleasure to read the book, for it is the work of an artist whose
touch is always delicate, and whose skill and sympathy never fail.
Permit the Baron to recommend Mr. Passingham, by THoMAs
CoBB (John LANE)....It is a simple yet absorbingly interesting story,
only an episodeinalife-time, admirably told, mainly incrisp dramatic
dialogue, without a note of false sentiment. The characters speak
for themselves; and an uncommonly good account they give
of themselves, too. The moral is that “Society's" absolution is
granted to any contravener of the moral law if he be of sufficient
wealth and importance to pay Society's price. Voilà tout.

solitary achievement there is very little that is really noteworthy
in their pleasantly-written and very readable biography by
Mr. BEAvAN (HURST AND BLACKETT).
“FRANK died quite conscious and quite, quite free from anxiety,
tº: he left me with two helpless children, and one unborn, and
very little money and no friends.” Here, in a sentence, we have,
my Baronite says, the keynote of the Life of Mrs. Oliphant,
edited by Mrs. HARRY CoGHILL, published by BLAckwood. FRANK
was Mrs. OLIPHANT's husband. spite of the taint of consump-
tion, he married a hapless girl, and had three children, who after
worrying the mother almost to death, died of the hereditary
disease. If a man were to, inevitably if not deliberately, encompass
the death of three innocent children by other means, he might
be hanged. But the law has no provision for this not uncommon
case. As for Mrs. OLIPHANT, she slaved daily, “ *.*. every-
body, including two worthless sons, whom she pinched herself to
send first to Eton, then to Oxford. The book has not the liter
value of the Lives earlier published of some of Mrs. OLIPHANT's
compeers. She went very little into society, had no interestin
circle of correspondents, and her own letters are chiefly filled wit
more or less pleasing incidents connected with the infancy and
boyhood of “my TIDDY,” and “my Cecco.” Others are addressed
to her publishers, urging the need of money to keep this dreadful
family going. Incidentally these latter reveal the true-heartedness
and generosity of the BLAckwoods, brought out in fuller detail in
Mrs. OLIPHANT's history of the House, “Whatever record leaps
to light they never can be shamed.” Mrs. Coghi LL has, doubtless,
done the best with the means at her disposal. But whilst the
works, it has one all its own in telling the story of a patient,
| courageous woman's life. In all her novels, Mrs. OLIPHANT has not
| revealed so sad a human story as is set forth in the chapters of
autobiography that preface the collection of Letters.
A delightful old-world flavour, compounded of Scotch sea-
captains, prim domesticity, quilts, presses, napery, and innocent
simplicity was wafted about me when I made the acquaintance of
Miss Nanse (author, SARAH TYTLER, publisher, John LoNG).
Soon, however, the simplicity and the innocence were disturbed
by the appearance on the scene of a gorgeous little Indian princess,
married to a brutal Scot, who cruelly ill-treats her. Her short,
unhappy life moves one to pity for her, to hatred of her husband.
Also there appear two nabobs back from India, the coarse brothers
of Miss Nanse and Miss Matty. But I have no space to do more
than say that the story is interesting and delightful, abounding in
unforced humour and knowledge of human nature. It is a
pleasure to read the book, for it is the work of an artist whose
touch is always delicate, and whose skill and sympathy never fail.
Permit the Baron to recommend Mr. Passingham, by THoMAs
Cobb (John LANE)....It is a simple yet absorbingly interesting story,
only an episodeinalife-time, admirably told, mainly incrisp dramatic
dialogue, without a note of false sentiment. The characters speak
for themselves; and an uncommonly good account they give
of themselves, too. The moral is that “Society's "absolution is

wealth and importance to pay Society's price. Voilà tout.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Tom (who has dined). “Do MIND where You ARE GoING ! You'll
BE TREADING ow MP PAIN DIRECTLY 1."
TO PARIS AND BACK.
“Parigi º O cara !” Paris I O dear! uncommonly dear, too,
if you do the thing in style and put up at that truly splendid and
luxurious hotel gui ;" “Ritz.” The name in English is
suggestive rather of bailiffs, debtors, legal proceedings, and hard-
upishness generally, than of millionairism, that is, if spelt “Writs.”
orty or fifty francs per diem for a lodging chez Ritz, however
luxurious, is just a franc or so beyond what even the extra-ordinary
voyageur is inclined to go. I should want a hundred loan power
crane to raise that amount. Now, how would I parcel out the
Hotel Ritz? On consideration, thus:—Au premier, Emperors
and Empresses, &c.; au deuxième, Kings and Queens; autroisième,
Princes and Royal Highnesses generally; aw quatrième, Dukes, &c.;
and so on up to the top storey. As to where ordinary Marquises
and Barons would come in, well—that's quite another storey.
The less exalted the rank the higher the etage. , My advice is,
become a number in any reasonable hotel, and then be free to
breakfast and dine out where you will. Don't forget, amid your
numerous engagements, to breakfast once or twice at la brasserie-
restaurant Mollard en face de la Gare St. Lazare, and to dine at the
Restaurant Marguery, next to the Gymnase. Such is your friend's
straight tip.
I have exclaimed as above “Parigi! O cara! ” but I must alter my
song to “O Paris! Untidy!” The untidiness of the boulevards! For
three days, morning, noon, and night, the Boulevard des Italiens, on
the left-hand side going towards the Porte St. Denis, was strewn
with torn paper, just as if there had been an autumn fall of book
leaves and newspaper cuttings. No brightness nor smartness, though
the weather was lovely. As to the thoroughfares, they were all
more dangerous than ever, in consequence of motor cars at high
ressure, and bicyclists at top speed, being added to the reckless
iving of cochers, which is far worse than that of the most dashing
hansom cabman who, but for the police, would make our London
crossings fatal to life and limb. at is crossing the Atlantic to
crossing from one side of the boulevards to the other, or even
from getting safely from the Café de la Paix to the corner of the
Boulevard des Capucines? So many Frenchmen are decores; is
there a bit of red riband given for saving life at street-crossings, or
for gallantry in escorting females through the perils of a Parisian
thoroughfare 2. The few sergents de ville to whom is confided the
control (!) of the traffic at certain points, do it after the manner of
good fairies in pantomime commanding a transformation, and
getting a great effect out of the adept use of an awkward-looking
magic wand, in the shape of one of our constable's staves, only
coloured white. But the constables are not always on the crowded
spots, and there are a majority of crowded spots where there are
no constables. Well, say what you like about “gay Paree,” but
“gie me Peebles for pleasure.” -
aving seen IRVING perform the marvellous feat of transforming
personage at various epochs of his career. Ahem l. Whether as
the Republican General, or as the Emperor in M. BERGERAT's
Plus que Reine, M. CoquELIN, as Napoleon, is more CoQUELIN
than ever. Mme. JANE HADING as Josephine is admirable. It
is but a poor play at best, with a tawdry, waxworkian, spectacular
effect of Josephine's coronation. Then at the Vaudeville there is
another indifferent piece, Madame de Lavalette, by M. MoREAU,
for which the acting of Madame RéJANE, Messieurs LÉRAND,
NUMEs (admirable as Louis the Eighteenth), MAURY, and of others
; in a numerous cast, achieves success. For a laugh, see
La Dame de chez Mazim, by GEorges FEYDEAU, at the Nouveautés,
and not only for a laugh, it being the very broadest farce, but for a
study of º comedy-acting on the part of M. TARRIDE and all
concerned. M. GERMAIN, the same as ever, reminds mesometimes
of ToolE, sometimes of Brough, and he still affects the old French
farce-actor's peculiar style of coming, as it were, out of the picture
to take the audience into his confidence. All the actresses are
uncommonly good, while sprightly Mlle. CAssive, who acts
capitally and dances and sings as well as she acts, is the very life
and soul of the absurdity. It is not a piece for the “Jeune per-
sonne,” bien entendu; but then so much depends on what sort of
a young person she may be.
Now, advice gratis, to those who are going to Paris:–Visit the
Salon in the morning between 10.30 and 1.30, when there is no
crowd; but, in the afternoon, and especially should it be Summer
weather, avoid the Salon, which is crowded by a mixture of all
sorts at, if I remember aright, half a franc a head. But for a few
woodland scenes, some wonderful reproductions of brass and
copper domestic utensils, and a charming picture, “La Servante,”
by J. BAIL, there is not any extraordinary attraction to be found
at a single visit among the three thousand works of art, exclusive
of sculpture. There is one *.*.*.*. to know, and that is,
that a very fair luncheon is to be obtained on the premises at a
fair price, and those gentlemen who like to spend a whole
day at the Salon without being deprived of their post-luncheon
cigar, can do so.
o back from our few days in Paris, thankful for having escaped
in safety from the reckless drivers of cabs and motors, and from
the scorching bicyclists; and, grateful for a quiet evening at
Calais, and a dinner, not to be beaten by any restaurateur in Paris,
at the Hotel Maritime, I return by the mid-day Calais-Douvres
boat, set foot once again on the chalky shores of Old England, and
send in this my account to your bureau, signing myself

AN ADAPTATION FROM AN_old FARCE.-In a piece played some
years ago at the Gaiety, Mr. ToolE had a catch phrase which
soon became popular. It was, “Keep your eye on your father,
and your father will pull you through.” This saying, with
“Reverend.” introduced, and the plural substituted for the
singular, might be applicable to the present “ecclesiastical crisis.”
Say the Bishops to distressed clergymen and aggrieved parishioners,
“Keep your eye on your Reverend Fathers, and your Reverend
Fathers will pull you through.” So mote it be l

Boatman. “I CANNA MIND A FINER FEsh For Its size 1"
ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL.
A CRUSHING REPLY.
WE have received from a celebrated
decorator a letter of such prodigious length
that it would occupy three entire numbers
of this journal. It is vastly longer than a
letter published in the Times of the 6th.
As we are unfortunately unable to devote so
much space to this one communication, we
publish portions of it.
SIR,--I am not accustomed to writing
and grammar has never been my strong
point but now, I have let others have their
say, I feel impelled to write a letter, some;
thing like one of Lord GRIMTHoRPE's, and
which will teach them all to mind their
own business though ever so much better
than any letter he ever wrote. You see
I can't bother about punctuation I just put
a comma in hore, and there. [Here we
omit#. lines.]
I did not care two straws, for the Ameri-
can fellow but there was some Italian idiot
wrote a letter to you who seemed to have
gone, clean off his head. I should like to
know how any Italian dares to dictate to an
Englishman or to tell }. and I what we
ought to do. At least he may tell you but
not me. [Here we omit two pages.]
Why I have studied painting all over the
world and then, some imbecile from Ital
comes and says I don't understand archi-
tecture. What is an architect 2 Give it up 2
He's a builder. When is an architect not a
painter. I am a painter and one of the
greatest painters, that ever [Here we omit
thirty-one lines] and compared to who
WELAsquez and REMBRANDT were mere no-
bodies. [Here we omit five and a half pages.]
Some fools seem to have a respect for
WREN though he never travelled all over
the world and could not paint even as badly
as most other painters besides me for he
never went farther than Paris and of course
he liked a cold-blooded respectable bourgeois
Nonconformist chilly Quaker Puritan bare-
ness instead of beautiful bright green
mosaics with yellow blobs and pink wall-
paper patterns that the Italian fool said
was like a lobster salad and now I come to
think of it I remember I did have some
lobster salad and a good plateful too the
evening before I coloured the design of
that part and that may interest you and
the public generally not that I care for their
opinion or yours come to that as a sort of
anecdote for future Lives of the Painters or
whatever they call the books and about the
greatest painter in the world also. I can't
waste time to put any commas into this.
[Here we omit nine es.]
But what I want to know is, how anybody
dares to attack me or my friend the Dean
whose portrait, you can see in the Academy
and which is one of the three best or three
only really good portraits there and each
ainted by me which was a great honour,
}. the Dean as you must admit. And who
are these people? All asses of course.
There are architects or, more correctly
they think nobody knows anything about
architecture but them, but they are just the
very ones who don't know anything about
it. There are painters but what business
have they to interfere with a painter?
There are outsiders but they are outsiders.
That settles them. So there remains no-
body but me, who is going on just the same
even if they yell their heads off. [Here we
omit eleven pages.]
If all these fools are furious I simply say,
in popular slang as I said, to my friend the
Dean whose portrait [Here we omit twenty
lines] when he got so angry with those
duffers who signed that memorial, “Keep
your hair on.” And if they answer as he
did to me and which I thought was shock-
ingly personal, “Get your hair cut,” I shall
reply with my accustomed º “I
P. it long as it makes some fools think
am an artist,” by which I mean of course
that wise men know it already and only
fools need an outward demonstration. [Here
we omit eighteen pages.]
Yours, &c. U. B. BLowed MAN.
P.S.—I fear this letter is rather long as it
is only introductory and just, meant to lead
up to several much longer ones I will send
you as soon, as I can get them written.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTRD FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 8,-The
insignificant world outside the walls of West-
minster knows but little of our SolICITor-
GENERAL. He is not reported in the news-
papers, either verbally or picturesquely. If
it were otherwise the world would still be
lacking in full knowledge of one of its
greatest men. It is not only what he says
and what he does that make Robert
BANNATYNE FINLAY a power. Where he
sits and how he looks are also matters of
import.
ARK remembers it was ever thus in quite
altered circumstances. Years ago, when
the dust of the earthquake still floated over
the wreck of the Liberal Party, the member
for Inverness preserved his old seat imme-
diately behind the Front Opposition Bench,
to which Mr. G. had been relegated. Not
the least great of Mr. G.'s magnanimities
was the manner in which he bore without
sign of resentment the desertion of oldfriends
and colleagues. Curious exception made
in case of FINLAY. If he ventured to
interpose in debate Mr. G. turned upon him
with the particular blazing light in his eyes
Mr. LECKY discovered and recorded. In a
rare burst of anger he once in private con-
versation , described the seceder as “sitting
with his knees in our backs.” To-day the
ex-Liberal member for the Inverness Burghs
sits in the opposite camp, his contiguity as
comforting to PRINCE ARTHUR as it was
disturbing to Mr. G. He does not often
*:::: but his mere presence suffuses over
e Treasury Bench an atmosphere of legal
lore and personal respectability worth
more than £6,000 a year and fees. When
he does speak he goes right to the point,
wasting no words on the way.
To-night Committee on London Govern-
ment Bill suddenly found itself confronted
by what in his absence might have proved
fatal difficulty. Amendment moved pro-
viding that a two-thirds majority present
at a meeting of a borough council should
actually vote on proposal to make elections
triennial. A cautious member appealed to
law officers of the Crown for º efinition
of the word “present.” Solicitor-GENERAL
on his feet in a moment.
“The word present,” he said, “means
present.”
“Do I believe that this here Son and
Heir's gone down, my lads,” said Captain
Mr. Solicitor “Bunsby.” “The word present
means present 1"
The Old Hand. “If he gets on like this I should be sorry to tackle him in a few years' time.

sulted by Captain Cuttle and Florence

If a skipper stands out by Sen' George's
Channel, making for the Downs, what's
right ahead of him? The Goodwins. He
isn't forced to run upon the Goodwins, but
he may. The bearings of this observation
lays in the application of it.”
Observe how, whilst not lacking in the
quality of oracularism, the Solicitor-
GENERAL's literary style is infinitely beyond
Captain Bunsby's. y comparison, that
great authority is positively verbose.
Business done.—In Committee on London
Government Bill.
Tuesday.—MACLEAN, like traditional Bri-
tisher, never knows when he's beaten. Up
again to-night wanting to know whether,
now Blue Book is out, Ministers will give
day for discussing Indian Sugar Duties.
PRINCE ARTHUR, with the mild asperity of
middle-aged father dealing with intractable
child, blandly admits interest of topic. No
one more, than her Majesty's Ministers
would find pleasure in discussing it—if only
there were time. Of course, “if the author-
ised Leaders of the Opposition” demanded
a day it would be different.
PRINCE ARTHUR's comprehensive glance
along the benches opposite as he talked
about the authorised Leaders was better
than some plays. Starting from below the
gangway, it rested for a moment on the
suave countenance of the SAGE of QUEEN
ANNE's GATE. It flashed by JoBN DILLoN
and REDMonD ainé, sitting in sweet com-
F.T. at the corners of the back
enches. "Crossing the gangway it fell for a
moment on Mr. STEADMAN and Mr. CALD-
well. It dwelt for a measurable space of
time on the seat, empty for the moment,
of the SQUIRE of MALwooD, brightening as
it finally fell on the amused countenance of
CAwmELL-BANNERMAN, buttressed on either
side by faithful henchmen.
The careful selection of the plural, and
this accompanying look round, were more
effective than an hour's speech on the fatal
(Sir W-ll-am H-re-rt and Lord H-gh C-c-l.)
Business done.—Getting on very well with
the London Government Bill. PRINCE
ARTHUR, after swearing he would ne'er
consent to all sorts of things, liberally
consents.
Thursday.-Being Ascension Day, Com-
mittees which usually meet at noon have
doors closed against them up to two o'clock.
This in order to give members opportunity
of going to Church. JoHN ELLIs made
blood-curdling discovery that the naughty
Lords not only haven't been to Church, but
have been at work in their Committees just
as if it were an ordinary day ! . As soon as
ever school opens up and tells the master.
“Please, Sir, why should we have to go to
Church on a Thursday when the Lords
don't º'
PRINCE ARTHUR taken aback by , sud-
denness of inquiry and enormity of ini-
quity indicated; quite unusually embar-
rassed; falters forth reply about the Lords
not sitting at all on Ascension Day, giving
it up entirely to devotional exercise. John
ELLIs not to be put off in that way. Insists
that Lords' Committees sat at usual hour
whilst the Commons were supposed to be at
Church. Driven into a corner PRINCE
ARTHUR pettishly protests he “knows
nothing about the Lords' Committees.”
Here matter dropped; evidently cannot
there remain. As JEMMY LowTHER says,
it's bad enough to have the Peers meddling
in Parliamentary elections. But if when
the Commons go to Church on Ascension
Day they are to go about their ordinary
business or pleasure, the thing must be
looked into. Business done,—John. Ellis
puts his . on a flaw in the Constitution
of these realms.
Friday.—House still puzzling over John
MELLOR's riddle. He flashed it forth quite
casually in the vigorous, speech he contri-
buted to debate on Church Discipline Bill.
“What is the difference between the
ATToRNEY-GENERAL and a Bishop?" -
Really, when we come to think of it,
there's very little. Imagine Dick Webster

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday, May 15.-A fine performance of
Tannhäuser, with SUsAN STRong as Venus,
showing herself quite up to her name in
every respect; while FRAU GADski was an
admirable Elisabeth. Conductor was, for
the first time, Herr Dr. MUck. He's first-
rate, so far: going so well, indeed, where
this WAGNER is concerned, that the Syndicate
would be justified in “running a-Muck”
for the whole Wagnerian series. The two
WANs, Dyck and Rooy, did not impede the
traffic, but, au contraire, helped the action
and the music, and, not being overladen
WANs, carried every one with them. “Jupi-
ter” PLANgoN excellent and impressive as
Herman, the King—or, as Herbert Pocket
said of Mr. Wopsle as Hamlet, he was
“massive and concrete.”
Altogether, a fine performance, and very
grand finale to Second Act, Royalty
present: house crowded. Vive Wagner 1
Thursday.—Die Walküre, but we were
Walküre-ing off for Whitsun-tide, which,
with Whitsun-time, waits for no man, and
so must leave our brief comments on the
Walküre family until we can sit down to
it quietly. here's the Anglo-German
travestie of this work entitled “Hookurie.
Waikure",
• COLOURABLE IMITATION.
[“Witness. “The difficulty is that no sooner
does a song become popular than hundreds of other
versions are published under the same title.
There are seven different versions of The Lost
Chord.' Iord Knutsford “Do they vary the title
at all—say, The Found Chord, or something of that
sort?’ ‘’No, my lord.’”—Report of the Selent
Committee of the Lords on the subject of Copyright.]
PROMPTED by his lordship's hint as to the
possibilities of a variation in title, trivial
enough to be almost imperceptible, Mr.
Punch hastens, in advance of fresh legisla-
tion, to publish modified versions of one or
two well-known songs under titles so closely
imitative that they might deceive even the
original author.
PRESENT YET ABSENT.
(To a Garrulcus Consort.)
Like the flight of a wombat
That swoops on a flea
Thy tongue is in combat
uite often with me;
A two-fold arrangement—
I am where thou art;
Yet my head, in estrangement,
Is far from thy heart.
Speak up, I am near thee,
My distance I keep;
Cannot see thee, nor hear thee,
In fact am asleep;
Speak up, I'm complacent,
My silence is deep;
I'm away, though adjacent,
In fact am asleep I
If habit but quickens
The spell of thy sting,
M}. slumber but thickens
he point of the thing
It is not thy rudeness,
That isn't the word;
It is not thy crudeness,
Though that is inferred
What ruffles my hair, as
Thou oughtest to know,
Is that, without whereas,
Thou borest me so;
Yea, all that I seize on
As truly de trop, \
Is that, without reason,
Thou borest me so.
Our second example is a revised topical
version of The Creole Love Song. The
original, itself slightly coloured in the South-
ern manner, was found to be still further
colourable. We have accordingly added c.
tone or two of rich sepia, with a coat of
mahogany varnish. The title remains prac-
tically unchanged.
The KAFFIR RUM Song.
[“Wisitors are requested not to give drink to the
natives"—Notice at the Greater Britain Echº-
bition.]
I smile all day at the Earl's Court mob,
Till I ache, Iache, in my black, black nob;
I shiver and cough in the chill, chill rain,
And 'tis O, I would I were warm again.
Orum ! O Jamaica rum !
The sort that they sell down south!
I pine in the pit of my tum,
or thee i pine in my large-sized
mouth I
But O, if my feet had wings,
To fly like a 'possum far,
In a sardine-berth to the ends of the earth,
Where DE BEERs and the deep bores are;
Away where the rum-barrel blooms
With balm for my thick, thick tongue;
If only to breathe of its odorous fumes,
Or to die with a kiss on its bung!
Will no man give me the price of a grog
For the i.” the whites that I'm here to
og
It's dull work murdering WILson's troop
With nothing to oil my sweet war-whoop!
Orum! O Jamaica rum !
The sort that they sell down south I
Ipine in the Fº of my tum,
or thee. I pine in my large-sized
mouth !
But 0 if my feathers were fur,
The fur of a Polar bear,
To fly where my wives in their bee-, bee-
hives
Are rending their back-, back-hair!
Away where a Kaffir may bask
Quite nude on his native heath,
And soak like a sponge at the up-tipped cask,
Or lie like a log underneath
“Not annulation, but revision,” is the
sº Paris now, regarding the DREYFUs case.
We can well believe it: for “annulus"
means a littlerlag, and annulation of course
the “wheels within wheels,” of which
Bºrus, France and the world are heartily
sick.

TO THE QUEEN,
FoE HER MAJESTY's EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY,
MAY 24, 1899.
WHAT can we say that was left unsaid,
Lady and Queen, when the circled years, .
Set as a glory about your head,
Won you worship above your peers?
No new thing, as your heart knows well;
Only again on a day of days
Some of #. gathered love we tell
Deep in our hearts that lies always.
Still with this for your unspoilt dower
Tested of Time's unerring gauge,
Peace be yours of the evening hour
Down the westering ways of age;
Still may the burden of life be felt
Hardly at all in the years' despite ;
Slow may the long-drawn shadows melt
Into the shade of the restful night.
SOME PROBABLE AGENDA
Of the Peace Conference now being held at
the Hague.
§ 1. Declarations of war shall in future be
abolished, as being calculated to wound the
feelings of opponents. Hostilities shall be
quietly and without undue fuss commenced,
as early as possible before the other side has
had due warning or time for preparation.
The initial advantage thus gained will tend
to cripple the enemy and thereby bring
about a more lasting peace.
§ 2. The term casus belli shall be discarded,
both phrase and connotation being anti-
quated. The more modern “pin-prick”
shall be substituted, and deemed a sufficient
cause for energetic reprisals by land, and
Sea.
§ 3. A commission of 50 per cent. shall in
future be º upon all future war indemni-
ties into the Pool or Imperial Treasury of
Russia, that Power being the promoter of
the Peace Conference.
§ 4. All further discussion as to the policy
of the “Open Door” shall be dropped, as
being calculated to lead to useless friction.
§ 5. The Great Powers shall first annex
and disarm the smaller States. and shall then
successively disarm themselves, England
having the priority in this respect, as the
remier naval Power, and Russia coming
ast, as occupying that position in alpha-
betical order.
§ 6. Every intending belligerent shall
pledge itself to refrain from the use of bows
and arrows, º catapults, batter-
ing-rams, cross-bows, Greek fire, chariots
with scythes attached to the axles, and
elephants-of-war. An infringement of this
shall be reckoned as one point to the oppo-
site team, with a further fine of ten points
to the pool (see section 3).
§ 7. Every campaign shall be conducted
according to the scoring principles of the
game of billiards. Each victory to count a
certain number of points according to the
decision of the umpire, who .# be (ea:
officio) the TsAR: the game to be not less
than a hundred up, and the stakes to be
paid into the pool (see section 3). Marker
to be Mr. W. 1. STEAD.
$ 8. No persons under seven years of age,
or over eighty, to be liable for conscription;
the enlistment of women to be discouraged;
and perambulators and other similar deadly
machines shall not be allowed in action
under º circumstances.
§,9. War correspondents to rank, above
Field-Marshals, and to be responsible for
the plan of campaign in the inverse ratio

SUNDAY PAPERS,
SIR,-Why not stop all Sunday Papers?
I get away on Saturday, midday, and don't
want to hear or see any more of business
until Monday morning. As long as no one
in the same line as myself sees a paper, no
one can steal a march upon me, except by
rivate information, which he can get any
§. of the week. I don't care a dump for
what happened on Saturday after business
hours, and as to reports of operas, plays, and
such like matters, surely it is much better to
have it all fresh on Monday? Yours,


of their age and experience.
your good-hearted readers see to it that the

“WANTED, A CHAPERONE, GOOD NERVE inDISPENSABLE."
[“New York GIRLs' LATEST.-One of the sights that early morning visitors to Central Park have a chance to enjoy is the ap
ladies who are being tutored in the art of “tooling’ four-in-hand teams . . . . the chaperone and the guards occupying seats in the
used for the purposes of instruction.”—New York Times.]
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN The Passing of Prince Rosan (THoMAs, BURLEIGH), Mr. John
BICKERDYKE contrives to make us sup full of horrors. His
characters include an Afghan Prince, who doubles the parts of
dusky patriot and British swindler, a pre-Hooleyan company
promoter, who buys coronets for the frontº of his prospectuses,
and is eventually revealed as the steward of the Afghan patriot's
#. yacht, and a lovely Indian princess who is, in reality, the
aughter of an English peer. With the rest of the characters,
they march through scenes of storm on many seas. There are
dark intrigues, there are torpedoes, there is electricity, and there is
piracy. The supposed narrator, Mr. Lucas Gilbert, is a barrister
sensitive to the appeals of beauty, and an occasional destroyer of
the Queen's English. We are told that he was once at Trinity
Hall, Cambridge. . Not there surely did they teach him to write
that “the minds of we poor harassed mortals were apt to run riot,”
that “we were sitting at the table with men whom we feared had
the intention of marooning us,” or that “as for we men, we had
lost the day.” Not even prolonged intercourse with a fraudulent
Afghan can excuse these solecisms on the part of the heroic but
ortunate barrister.
A Paladim of Philanthropy º AND WINDUs) gives the title
to a collection of those delightful papers which only Mr. AUSTIN
Dobson can write. He has, my Baronite says, the key of the
wine-cellar of English literature of the Augustan and the Silver
Ages. At will he brings up bumpers fresh and cool, lacking
nothing of colour or bouquet by reason of age. The present
volume is particularly opportune in its appearance, since it con-
tains an excellent account of Old Whitehall and the peerless
Banqueting House, sole legacy of the seventeenth century to the
(in respect of architecture) degenerate nineteenth. In other
papers, GoLDSMITH, STEELE, and JoHN GAY live in the very clothes
of their time.
HANs CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN has long been naturalised in this
country. Never before have his Fairy Tales been turned forth in
such sumptuous dress at moderate charges as Messrs. NEwNEs
have, arrayed them withal. My Baronite, reading again, the
familiar stories, comes upon one written long before Sedan, which
shows how this other Dane's prophetic soul beheld in the future
one of the products of that great tragedy. Many years ago he
ance of young
y brake always
clothes that he spent all his money º dress and finery. He
had a coat for every hour in the day, and just as in other countries
they say of a king,” His Majesty is in the Council Chamber,' they
said of him, ‘The Emperor is in his dressing-room.’” The stories
are º: by upwards of 400 pictures from the
pencil of Miss HELEN STRATToN.
FLORENCE WARDEN is entitled to the degree of “M.S.,” meaning
Master of the Sensational. Grateful must all who pine for excite-
ment in novel-reading be to this authoress, inasmuch as she has
not kept The Secret of Lynndale to herself, but has published it
to the world, per Messrs. F. W., WHITE & Co. Chapter after
chapter leads the reader on, and it is with considerable reluctance
that the deeply interested peruser puts down the book at the
sound of the dinner hour, or when unconquerable drowsiness
compels him to remember bed time. What is The Secret & Well,
the Baron knows, and ventures to think it is so highly improbable
as to amount almost to impossible, admitting, however, that there
is much virtue in “almost.” The story serves its purpose, which
is to interest absorbingly up to a point within measurable distance
of the dénowment. The Baron can quote the heroine's words as
applicable to the whole story. Says Meg, on learning the secret,
§: that is scarcely conceivable to me,” and at one with the
opinion of the heroine is that of the diffident and sympathetic
BARON DE B.-W.
LETTER TO THE EDITOR.
“The sentiment concerning Sunday Papers at Eton.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I really must write telling you my surprise
at the strange omission made by Lord RosłBERY in his speech
about Sunday Papers. Why, fancy, he-a jolly good chap and an
Etonian—never even º the suppression of the only Sunda
Papers which I, and my tutor's pupils, cordially loathel
allude to the long-prevalent custom here of “setting” seventh day
papers, known locally as Sunday “Q's,” or Questions. The issue
of these things entails Sabbath Day Labour upon Over a Thousand
Etonians, who, goodness knows, are worked hard enough six days
of the week! Please agitate for us in the matter. The pater
advised me to write to the Times, but I thought, perhaps, that
journal might not take me seriously. Besides, you've always
een a pal of mine. Hoping to see you on the “ foºth,”

wrote, “There lived an Emperor who was so fond of having new

liberty of offering few remarks in su º: of
clause. This reckless conduct forced JAMEs
of HEREFord's hand. Had long known
Tweed MoUTH's guilty secret. Came down
to House without intention of disclosing it;
disposed rather to carry it with him to
the grave. Tu l'as woulu, George Damdin

“What,” says Lord JAMEs, sternly regard-
ing culprit across the Table, “was the noble
Lord doing in the Committee room whilst
the Water Bill was under discussion?”
Blood forsook the countenance of the
arraigned peer, as the tide ebbs from the
feet of the ancient town whence he derives
his territorial dignity. The scanty Opposi-
tion huddled together as sheep forewarned
of coming storm. What fearful, charge
underlay this inquiry 7 What terrible con-
fession was the House about to hear?
Staggering to his feet, holding on to the
Table for support, TweedMoUTH hoarsely
whispered, “I was there for an hour and
twenty minutes, but—.” Here the audi-
ence, scarcely less affrighted than the
accused, strained their ears to catch the
almost inaudible whisper—“simply as a
spectator.”
“The noble Lord,” said the accuser,
sternly, “was giving moral support to the
Chairman of the Committee.”
This brought Lord RIBBLEs DALE to the
front, with gallant assurance that “my
noble friend gave me no moral support.”
At this point, disturbed by unwonted
sounds, the MARKIss, who had sweetly slept
through JAMEs of HEREFoRD's Episcopal
charge in moving rejection of clause, woke
up, hurriedly acquainted himself with pur-
port of conversation, and assumed function

Friday. — Capital title “Our" Lord
CHARLEs BEREsford has for his voluminous
circular describing his business trip to the
Far East. The Break-Up of China he calls
it. CHARLIE is himself though China fall.
Amongst many shrewd observations is one
summing up his conclusions of what should
be British policy with respect to China.
“I hold that to break up a dismasted craft,
the timbers of which are stout and strong,
is the policy of the wrecker for his own
gain. The real seaman tows her into dock
and refits her for another cruise.”
Thus CAP'EN ToMMY Bowles, having
received fresh injury in his daily fight, has
arranged to be towed into dock for the
Whitsun Recess, coming out spick and span,
refitted for another cruise when House
has lent pathetic interest the corner seat above gangway, where, like
Providence, he sits up aloft and watches
over JACK TAR JokIM and other of Her
Majesty's Ministers. A leg lost at Trafalgar,
an arm shot clean away at Navarino, his
best white ducks perforated in the rear
with the only grape-shot fired off Bomar-
sund, it seemed that Fate had done its
worst to the veteran. Last Friday night,
in Committee of Ways and Means on the
Budget Bill, he, as all the world knows,
came out of the Division Lobby with only
one “Aye.”
There is a good deal of talk about the
artition of China. In the comparative
eisure of the Recess let the civilised world

IF I had a son (but I haven't got one,
Which I state in order to counteract
The charge that the verse I indite is not one
Which is based on fancy and not on fact.
For I know there's a kind of necromancy
Which enables a reader at once to guess
That an article based on the merest fancy
Is nothing but facts in a fancy dress.
So I state it again as a final judgment,
This declaration about my son,
Which is certainly not in the least for fudge

I haven't a son, Sir, no not one).
But if I were a father (some day I may be),
I never should hesitate at all:
I should train my innocent babbling baby
To the making of Empires large or small.
The education would not be easy;
But what, of that ? It's a great career:
You start on a slope that's nice and greasy,
And, whizzl you've a million or so a year.

“I’m running up Empires, tot per annum;

I should hire a Professor of Shares to lecture,
With a model “House” as a lecture-room,
On water-tight methods that best connect
your

AN AFTER-DINNER DREAM OF THE DERBY,
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
At a period which everybody hopes is still far off the close of a
busy life, JUSTIN McCARTHY sits down to write his Reminiscences,
pub ished in two handsome volumes by CHATTo AND WINDUs.
Since the time of Ulysses few have seen more of cities and of men.
The rare peculiarity of Mr. McCARTHY's work is that, reviewing
troops of friends paraded on the field of a marvellous memory, he
has not an unkind thing to say of any one. There is one passage
at which the temptation to sprinkle a little cayenne §. on his
dish seemed irresistible. Writing to him in 1866, at the time when
on the Reform Bill certain Liberals led by Mr. Lowe deserted Mr.
GLADstone and the Liberal Party, forming the world-famed Cave

THE TWENTY.FIRST CENTURY PUBLISHING
COMPANY, LIMITED.
THIs Company has been formed to carry on the ordinary
business of a publisher on the system devised by the eminent
American humorist, MARK Twain, in a moment of seriousness.
Instaad of .# books within a few months of their completion,
the Company will not publish any work until a century after the
death of the author. All unpleasantness, opposition, and fear of
litigation on the part of the author's contemporaries will thus be
avoided. In the case of any author who may wish to receive
remuneration for his work, the necessary deeds will be drawn up
by the Company's solicitors to secure for his heirs, or their assigns,
a share of the profits or a royalty on each copy sold. The Com-
pany cannot treat with any impecunious writer whatever
who might be misguided enough to desire some profit for
himself during his lifetime. The public taste varies, so much
during a year, or even during a month, that it would be impossible
to estimate the probable sale of any work a century hence.
The Company has received some very important testimonials
from eminent authors. The following are a few extracts:–
From a celebrated Authoress.-I think your scheme an excellent
one, though I should not personally be disposed to publish my
works in this way. The present race of ignorant critics, actuated
by mean envy of my attainments and achievements, attempts to
depreciate the value of my books. Nevertheless, I have the largest
circulation of any novelist in the world. I am convinced that my
immortal works, the names of which are in the catalogue of every
circulating library, will continue to be published a century hence.
SHARspeARE is not yet forgotten. Perhaps you might persuade
Mr. HALL CAINE to adopt your system.
From a famous Author.—For others, mere penny-a-liners all of
them, your plan is admirable. I should not care for it. My works
are not for one day, or for one century. They are for all time,
including the present. SHAKSPEAR wrote on this system, and I
quite ºpprove of it. Possibly Miss MARIE CoreLLI would like your
method.
From an eminent Poet.—Your system of publication is the best
one could imagine for all ordinary poets. But for me, “by
appointment” the official writer of odes and madrigals, instinct
with journalistic actuality, the º of a day would be embarrass-
ing. The delay of a century would be too terrible to contemplate.
“More long, more loved,” as I have myself written, will apply to
my poetry. But, immortal though they will certainly be, the
actuality is indispensable for my effusions, to which I may apply
the words of PETRARCH,
“Oime "1 Paºla; ch'ogni aspro ingegno e fero

In my prose writings I am fond of quotations, but I will only giv

AN AFTER-DINNER DREAM OF THE DERBY.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
At a period which everybody hopes is still far off the close of a
busy life, JUSTIN McCARTHY sits down to write his Reminiscences,
pub ished in two handsome volumes by CHATTo AND WINDUs.
Since the time of Ulysses few have seen more of cities and of men.
The rare peculiarity of Mr. McCARTHY's work is that, reviewing
troops of friends paraded on the field of a marvellous memory, he
has not an unkind thing to say of any one. There is one passage
at which the temptation to sprinkle a little cayenne §. on his
dish seemed irresistible. Writing to him in 1866, at the time when
on the Reform Bill certain Liberals led by Mr. Lowe deserted Mr.
GLADSTONE and the Liberal Party, forming the world-famed Cave
of Adullam, Mr. BRIGHT alludes to them as “the traitors of our
ranks.” . For fear that way of putting it should not be harsh
enough, he italicises the phrase. §. McCARTHY might here have
recalled the fact that when, exactly twenty-six years later, another
Liberal cave was formed and Mr. GLADsTons was again deserted, the
seceders were not called anything worse than “Dissentient
Liberals,” a phrase, my Baronite tells me, Mr. BRIGHT personally
resented as offensive. It must not be supposed that because Mr.
McCARTHY's Reminiscences lacks the pungency malice purveys that

PRIVATE VIEWS; MOSTLY
UNPOPULAR.
(By Mr. Punch's Vagrant.)
No. III.-MIDDLH AGE.
WHEN that my years were fewer,
Some twenty years ago,
And all that is was newer,
And time itself seemed slow,
With ardour all impassioned,
I let my hopes fly free,
And deemed the world was fashioned
My playing-field to be.
The cup of joy was filled then
With Fancy's sparkling wine;
And all the things I willed then
Seemed destined to be mine.
Friends had I then in plenty,
And every friend was true;
Friends always are at twenty,
And on to twenty-two,
The men whose hair was sprinkled
With littleflecks of gray,
Whose faded brows were wrinkled—
Sure . had had their day.
And though we bore no malice,
We knew their hearts were cold,
For they had drained their chalice,
And now were spent and old.
At thirty, we admitted,
A man may be alive;
But slower, feebler-witted,
And done at thirty-five.
If Fate prolongs his earth-days,
His joys grow fewer still;
And after five more birthdays
He totters down the hill.
We were the true immortals
Who held the earth in fee,
For us were flung the portals
Of fame and victory.
The days were bright and breezy,
And gay our banners flew,
And every peak was easy
To scale at twenty-two.
- - - -
And thus we spent our gay time
As having much to spend,
Swift, swift, that º playtime
Flew by and had its end.
And lo! without a warning
I woke, as others do,
One fine, mid-winter morning,
A man of forty-two,
And now I see how vainly
Is youth with ardour fired;
How fondly, how insanely
I formerly aspired.
A boy may still detest age,
But as for me, I know,
A man has reached his best age
At forty-two or so.
For youth it is the season
Of restlessness and strife;
Of ardour and unreason,
And ignorance of life.
Since, though his cheeks be rosy,
He will not understand,
This boy, that all he knows he
Has learnt at second-hand.
But we have toiled and wandered
With weary feet and numb;
Have doubted, sifted, pondered,—
How else should knowledge come?
And though no rose our cheeks have,
The sky still shines as blue;
And still the distant peaks have
The glow of twenty-two.

any rate given us a real live show, a by no

rose-scented, representation of life in the
wilds of the Dark Sub-continent. Readers

To see the scenery at the Empress Theatre

baboons that sit on the -line, the
elephants, that deserve the Red Cross for
their ambulance work, the battered and
original Gwelo coach with its still more
original driver, and the great indaba, of
natives around “Prince” LoBEN sitting
(apparently) on his thumb. But when we
come to the more than cinematographic
reproduction of sanguinary events that
occurred only three years ago, with, in one
case, the actual participants on both sides
repeating history before us, we are on more
3. ground, and one wonders what are
the actual sentiments of the swaggerin
Matabele as they file through the lines o
spectators back to their kraal after the
erformance. However, the “Genial
rank,” as they always call him at the
Cape, deals out poetic justice in the end.
At least five dusky warriors are mown
down by the deadly spitfire maxims. Alto-
gether, it is a very É. show, with a little
too much rifle-cracking, and some food for
solid reflection.

The following points, according to our
trustworthy Paris Correspondent, are the
principal ones in which Madame BERN-
HARDT's, interpretation will depart from
accepted traditions.
On first seeing the Ghost (in the fourth
scene of the first act) masculine actors have
usually spoken in a husky and awe-struck
whisper by way of tribute to the super-
natural visitant. Madame BERNBARDT will
greet the mysterious phantom with a shrill
scream, without which no lady, on the stage,
has ever been known to receive a ghost.
Again, in the third act, when Polonius is
eavesdropping, the accomplished actress
will make a great point of Hamlet's §
“How now ! A rat 7” Springing lightly
.. a chair and wrapping her cloak tightly
about her ankles, she will give a masterly
representation of the terror which the
presence of a rat or mouse invariably arouses
in the breast of a lady on the stage. The
Queen, similarly alarmed, will take refuge
on another chair, and it will be only after a
servant has entered and despatched the in-
vading beast that the two ladies will venture
to look behind the arras. They will then
discover the corpse of Polonius, and the
curtain will fall upon an edifying scene of
relief, Madame BERNHARDT exclaiming, in
French, “Thank goodness, it wasn't a rat
after all!”
In the Soliloquy, again, a novel and inter-
esting point will be made. Hamlet will be
discovered working at a sampler, and when
he comes to the lines—

AYLWINNIEWYNNE; OR, THE ROMANY ROT.
(After Mr. Th-d-re W-tts-D-nt-n, by Mr. Punch's Depreciator.)
CHAPTER I.-The Apostle.
“You are with me, dear Master,” said the mystic WHDRBEEst,
“and all the exponents of the symbolic school are with me, too
when I say that studies from the human figure may be divided
into two broadly-distinguishable groups—studies from the male
and studies from the female. Now my late model, who assisted
me in the second of these two fields of labour, was a gift of the
gods; sent, I am assured, from Heaven by my sainted grand-
mother, who was in the bargee business. ithout affectation of
modesty, I may say...that she promised to be the making of m
immortal picture, “The Pursuit of Innocence' (now due in Bon
Street); and would also have contributed largely to the triumph of
the adjacent predella, representing ‘Arethusa in the Bulrushes.’
“As chief living º: of the Aylwinniewynnian theory, first
evolved by the inspired father of our young, but erring, friend, the
hero, in his e ºg work, D.T.; or, The Spotted Dog—a
work despised by H-RE-RT SP-No-R, but highly commended by the
great and good W. T. ST-D–I am something of a mystic. But
not to every double-sighted seer is it given to discover, in the
promenade of the Walhalla, selling daisies, a type of virgin pure
as the unsullied flowers she proffered to the passer-by. I tracked
her home to the residence (at Wºgºs of her mother, Mrs.

cataclysms her tout ensemble became rigid; while her face, the
emblem of artless innocence, under its eager Celtic fringe (for she

to look behind the arras. They will then
discover the corpse of Polonius, and the

AYLWINNIEWYNNE ; OR, THE ROMANY ROT.
(After Mr. Th-d-re W-tts-D-nt-n, by Mr. Punch's Depreciator.)
CHAPTER I.-The Apostle.
“You are with me, dear Master,” said the mystic WILDRBEEST,
“and all the exponents of the symbolic school are with me, too
when I say that studies from the human figure may be divide
into two broadly-distinguishable groups—studies from the male
and studies from the female. Now my late model, who assisted
me in the second of these two fields of labour, was a gift of the
gods; sent, I am assured, from Heaven by my sainted grand;
mother, who was in the bargee business. ithout affectation of
modesty, I may say...that she promised to be the making of m
immortal picture, “The Pursuit of Innocence' (now due in Bon
Street); and would also have contributed largely to the triumph of
the adjacent º representing ‘Arethusa in the Bulrushes.’
“As chief living apostle of the Aylwinniewynnian theory, first
evolved by the inspired father of our young, but erring, friend, the
hero, in his epoch-compelling work, D.T.; or, The Spotted Dog—a
work despised by H-RB-RT SP-NC-R, but highly commended by the
great and good W. T. ST-D–I am something of a mystic. But
not to every *ś seer is it given to discover, in the
promenade of the Walhalla, selling daisies, a type of virgin pure
as the unsullied flowers she proffered to the passer-by. I tracked
her home to the residence (at Wapping) of her mother, Mrs.
BLUDGEoN, specialist in bloaters. e it was that in person
chaperoned the Ideal to my studio; though, after a few sittings, I
dispensed with the elder lady's services, which were all too plainly
º ted by venal avarice. Everything went well till the adora-
le Miss BLUDGEoN developed fits. During the crises of these
cataclysms her tout ensemble became rigid ; while her face, the
emblem of artless innocence, under its eager Celtic fringe (for she
came of a Welsh line,—I think the Snowdon-Llanberis branch)
acquired the verisimilitude of a carbuncle set in paste of Paris.
"Taught to regard all phenomena as designed for my ultimate
rofit by the sainted JEMIMA WILDEBREST (now in Heaven, but
ormerly in the bargee business), I took advantage of these re-
curring seizures to paint the possessed girl into my picture of
‘Lot's Wife' for the ensuing Salon. What were the predisposing

the wife of the well-known patriarch) I am at a loss to conjecture;
but I confess that the events which immediately preceded these

DERBY WINNER.
Robson UP–Goes on E BETTER THAN Tod SLOAN.
ASCOTT HEATH ON THE DERBY.
HoNourED SIR,-My revered Uncle,
DARBy Jones, being still confined to his
room by gout (I state this fact in view of
the malevolent suggestions of certain
traducers), I am requested by him to convey
to you my impressions of what the Ordinary
journalist styles “The Great Epsom Carni-
val.” My Uncle and myself differ, I trust,
...' much in our º of Humanity
and Horseflesh. Between ourselves, now
that he is laid up on a bed of sickness, he
knows no more distinction between a rock-
ing-horse and a racing crock than does an
ordinary mortal between sausages and
mashed potatoes and a filet de sole d la
Dieppoise. There you apprehend me, I
imagine. His idea of the Derby is a pano-
rama of vulgar revelations, such as you
may read in the descriptive account of
any daily newspaper.

MoRTon on the cinematograph would pro-
bably run as follows:—
h (1) THE START, Mr. CovenTRY in a dead
eat.
(2) THE RACE,--ToD SLoAN, MoRNY
CANNoN, or O. MADDEN trying to square
Tattenham Corner.
(3) THE FINISH,-Cheering of the Winner
while the Welshers vamose.
Throw in the Property Dog, the Police-
men, the Coaches, the Omnibuses, the
Nigger Minstrels, and the Toy Vendors, and
you will probably have a correct realisation
of a scene, which I am given to understand
will be brought to our eyeballs in the
forthcoming Crystal Palace Review. This
is not my way of looking at the Derby. I
am young and foolish (so I am told), and I
like to find others as young and more foolish
as myself. Give melºpsom on the top of a
coach, whence I can gaze upon creation-
and it is creation unlimited in every respect
—with the eye of a Lord thereof. I don't
run about like my honoured Uncle picking
up “tips.” I have them all in my pouch.
I don't salute Noblemen and Eminent
Commoners with hat liftings, as he does,
because I feel the Equal of any Man or
Woman, and all the hat lifting in the world
doesn't make Winners. It only promotes
sycophants and cigarettes. From a Picca-
dilly and Pall Mall point of view the Derby
is over, but I venture to differ with precon-
ceived notions in as far as place-money is
concerned. Therefore I predict without
prejudice—
I cannot go Nap on My Son,
For Modesty can't find aFº
But they tell me the Sword is A1,
That the Ensign may p'raps go the pace;
Of the Curse of Ould Erin beware
(I've heard this from many a lip),
To whom Landlord may prove a smart scare
When the Baronet comes down the “dip.”
For myself I am going for one,
Sly Reynard the winner I find,
And *w-minºr crack is the crock you should
ack
With the Frenchman and B.'s just behind.
My revered Uncle—a Goth in matters of
taste—begs me to call your attention to the
fact that gin mixed with all manner of
bitters, Orange, peach, Angostura, Khoosh,
etc., is the most appetising teazer in the
world. I have not tried his recipe, but I

THE OLD REFRAIN.
THE attention of such composers as love
the modern fashionable ballad with a French
refrain (and the present writer flatters him-
self that his French is the genuine article—

Oh! sing me a song, my darling,
Oh! sing to me once again,
The cuckoo bird and the starling
Are chanting the old refrain.
Then tell me a tale at twilight,
Do not refuse me, dear,
I hear the cats on the sky-light,
Laissez les tous venir.
Oh! sing to me in the gloaming,
The song that I love the best;
The cattle are homeward roaming
The rose has retired to rest;
Then sing in those accents tender
Which I so love to hear,
Toasting my toes on the fender,
Laissez les tous venir.

DEAR SIR,-If there be now any misap-

hold the proud position of Champion of
England at billiards, permit me to state

the Franco-Belgic Carrousel, I consider
myself to be the leading representative of
British Billiards; and I am willing to stake Ali
any sum from half-a-crown upwards to prove
my title. My conditions are as follows:—
1. No pockets allowed save in the case of
losing hazards.
2. No cue to be used less than six feet in
length.
3. No calling of the game by the marker.
4. No representatives of the press to be
present.
5. No blue chalk to be used.

detected.

conditions are fair. Yours obediently,

THE CRITIC AS PLURALIST.
At Sea, May 23, 1899.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I have been looking
up a late controversy in the Daily Chronicle
on the question whether a critic should
write a variety of reviews on the same book
under different pseudonyms, and so give
the false appearance of a wide consensus of
opinion about the merits of that book; and
I find a letter written by a Mr. BULLock
which says, “Every one knows when he
reads the columns signed ‘CLAUDIUs CLEAR’
and ‘A MAN of KENT' in the British Weekly,
and the column signed “O. O." in the Sketch,
that he is reading ‘Comment and Chat” by
the gentleman who edits the Bookman. . . .
Every one, I say, whose foot is within the
literary circle knows this.... Within the
pale no one is deceived in the least; every
one reads and knows.” Now, Sir, I am very
far from wishing to insinuate that it is pos.
sible to have your foot, and even your head,
“within the literary circle,” without so
much as consulting the printed matter of
anyone of the three organs above-mentioned;
but I do protest against the confusion of
journalism with literature. “Within the
pale,” indeed! Why, Sir, the gentleman's
spelling is at fault: it should be pail, Sir,

of dancing men is due to the rough materials of
women's dresses. Some of the corsages now being

thistles, and provefatal to the nap.”—Daily Paper.]

Shall I the dainty waist forswear

Shall I through all the long, long night

Just to preserve my map so bright

Another aspect of the question;

FOOD AND PHILOSOPHY.
(Mems. from a Note-book picked up in
Pall Mall.)
Thoroughly enjoyed my first meal. Por-
ridge, coffee, a steak, and a couple of eggs.
Just enough to usher in the day's doings.
Cannot understand how the French manage
to live on a tea, even when “complete.”
Mid-day and lunch. Mistake to have it
too late. And yet breakfast has to be
digested. Say 12.80. I think soup is essen-
tial. Not too much, but just enough to
serve as a contrast to a .d sole, a roasted
fowl, and some simple sweet. Cheese at
discretion, with a café and a chasse. Surely
that is enough for any one.
Five o'clock is sacred to chat and tea.
But there can be no possible objection to
buttered buns or a few muffins. But not
too many. As the clock approaches six one
gets within reasonable distance of dinner.
Seven-thirty, and the principal meal of
the day becomes its principal business. An
oyster or two, or even three. A couple of
ladles of soup—clear of course. A fish
entrée and whitebait. Perhaps a filet de
baºuf. A vegetable. A capon salad, savoury,
and dessert. What more could one desire?
Champagne for choice. Mistake to mix
your wine. Coffee and brandy, of course.
After the theatre, just a snack. Grilled
bones at the club. Nothing more. Wash
them down with a glass of beer.
Indeed it is true, as Lord RoseBERY said
at Carshalton, “However wealthy you are,
you cannot eat more than one dinner a day.”
}. quite true ! You can only eat one
inner a day—and extras!
CURIOUs, YRT TRUE.-Why is it highly
probable that Mr. WILson BARRETT, actor,
manager, and author, cannot write his own
name? Because it seems that he always
“makes his mark” with the sign of the cross.

OPERATIO NOTES.
HRRE we go up, up, up with the prices,
for what are considered special occasions,
but the plan won't suit the public, especially
that portion of it looking forward to the
establishment of a National Opera House,
at prices of admission within easy reach of
most musical amateurs.
Saturday, May 20th, is to be noted in
Operatic history for the conversion of Les
uguenots 1 That is, The Huguenots was to
have been given, but Mous, SALEzA being
“indispoged,” Cavalleria and Pagliacci were
substituted. Sure such a pair of Operas
were never composed to meet by nature,
and to help a management in distress.
Mlle. STRAKosch came out admirably as
Santuzza, and that clever, quick-change-to-
anything—and ready, aye, ready at a mo-
ment's notice—artiste, Mlle. BAUERMRIsner,
was dramatically excellent (she can never
be anything else, bless her l) as the little
mother Lucia (without the Lammermoor).
Whit Wet Monday. —Don't know how
Faust went, or if SALEzA, convalescent, was
back again. Hope so. Mr. P.'s musical
waterproofs, and returned for WAGNER's
Der Fliegende Hollander on Tuesday evening.
Mr. David BISPHAM was as double a Dutch-
man as heart could desire. Frau GADskI was
charming in singing and spinning as Senta.
The nautical stage carpenters, or machinists,
in charge of the Dutchman's ship were
apparently, as was natural, very much at
sea; while Herr SchRAMM, a first-rate
“Man at the Wheel—with a song,” might
have been almost better employed on board
as the steward. The Operatic vessel was
piloted, in orchestra, through the violent
waves of sound by Dr. Muck, and alto-
gether our gay old friend, the . Flying
Dutchman, “out for a flutter,” for this
night only, was thoroughly satisfactory.
Wednesday, May 24–Queen's Eightieth
Birthday kept Operatically at Windsor,
where Mons. JEAN and Mons. Edouard DE
REszkE, or, to put it briefly and classically,
as there were two “Mons,” the Montes DE
REszke lift up their fine voices in the
characters of %. in and Heinrich der

they like music?) the performance was a
most brilliant success, and all the singers,
personally conducted by Signor MANCINELLI,
having been presented to her Gracious
Majesty, and having responded heartily to
the loyal toasts proposed by Messrs. HARRY
HIGGINS and Mr. MAURICE GRAU of the
Opera Sing-dicate, subsequently returned to
town congratulating themselvesonits having
been a most heavenly performance, under
the rººf: of the celestial representative,
Herr von ANGELI, who had watched over
them with affectionate interest.
Thursday.—The night after the Fair, i.e.,
after the Queen's Fête. Reaction expected.
Not a bit of it. In spite of last night's
fatigue, Mons. EDouard was going stronger
than ever as the Herbalist Friar in Romeo
and Juliette, while as to Madame MELBA,
she was at her very best as Juliette, to the
delight of a crowded house. M. SALEZA,
excellent as Romeo, and MANCINELLI all life

The Daily Mail says, “The commercial
advantages of such a line are not imme-
diately apparent.”. Surely it would be the

And, lo l except for Englishmen, the battle-field is blank.
In hosts all foreign navies may gather on the main,
French, German, Dutch and Russian, and what is left to Spain;
But, should they dare to beard us, our coats we swiftly doff,
And doom them to a watery grave before a gun goes off.
Oh, dauntless is our Tommy, resistless our Jack Tar!

By English engine-whistles and puffs of English steam.
Yet would I that this lion, who stalks Uganda's waste,
Had not for native porters so obdurate a taste.
Each day these §. are less by two or three,
And dark Uganda's lions have porter-steaks for tea.
And, oh, I did not wonder when England's Premier rued
That those who serve a railway should serve as lion-food.

This wounded word from AUSTIN's immortal works I quote),
ur literary England, as every schoolboy knows,
Conducts the car of poetry and leads the van of prose.
Our daily press is almost pathetically clean:
No blush it paints upon the cheek of charming seventeen;
Unlike some other countries, whose journalists must lie
In black and blatant headlines that take the public eye;
And where a mass of readers, un-English, rude and coarse,
Demands a daily pabulum of murder and divorce.
Our press, like all we own or do or think, is better far:
How comes this wondrous portent? What makes us what we are?
Each different orator I hear propounds a different cause:
One says it is our Monarchy, while one prefers our laws.
Another votes for cricket-fields, where thousands, stuck like glue,
Athletically sit and watch the play of twenty-two.
A fourth proposes farmers, the race whose sturdy toil
With unremunerative corn adorns the costly soil.
A fifth declares for Sunday, the one day out of seven
Designed to draw our English thoughts from earthly things to

The day on which nor LAwson nor HARMsworth may appear,
The day kept strictly sacred to Church and Mrs. BEER;
On which with good and pious things our moral selves we drench:

Which is it? Church, or farmers, or cricket-fields, or trains?
Or County Courts, or Laureates, or long and brilliant reigns 2

Our strength, our health, our manliness, our Epsom Derby race?
Our passion for reposing on one day in the week?
Our golden hoards, our gilded youth, our little silver streak 2
Each one of these has claimed, I know, in whole or bit by bit,
The manufactured Englishman as being due to it.

Now that a journal has been started deal-
i. the costume of man, there seems
to be no reason why the touch-and-go artists
of the daily press should not devote as much
attention to masculine attire as they do to
the garments of the fair sex. Mr. Punch,
ever anxious to be more than up-to-date,
ventures to submit a couple of samples of
the style necessary to the cut:-
“At Church Parade yesterday we noticed
Lord ALGERNoN BIGTREE talking with Sir
CHARLEs McMUFFLER, the former wearing a
rich blue diagonal overcoat with ermine
collar and cuffs, which contrasted well with
a lemon and olive Italian silk necktie con-
fined by a massive gold ring studded with
rubies and emeralds, while the very curly
brimmed Himalaya hat was adorned on the
left side with a plume of mingled macaw
and humming-bird feathers. Lord ALGER:
NoN's double cheviot trousers were of pearl
greyshot with carmine, and his gloves, lemon
sewn with olive to match his neckerchief.
He carried a Toothpickumbrella of the same
hues. Sir CHARLEs's costume was less
aesthetic, but very effective. The coatee, cut
away sharply over the hips, was of green
billiard cloth, with revers and collar of black
lambskin, the buttons being of Norwegian
silver, and the buttonhole of arum lilies;
a racoon cap with tail pendent was voted
very smart. Sir CHARLEs's somewhat broad

he waistcoat and kilt were of the familiar
McMUFFLER tartan, red, white and blue—
a heavy lapis-lazuli watchguard being
thrown across the former, and an effective
addition to the costume was a phillibeg of
porcupine quills. In lieu of hose Sir CHARLEs
wore cardinal velvet spat-puttees, fastened
with turquoise clasps.” ºv. … oºz -

Mr. WAN SLITTER's only ornaments were the

AYLWINNIEWYNNE; OR, THE ROMANY ROT.
(After Mr. Th-d-re W-tts-D-nt-n, by Mr. Punch's Depreciator.)
CHAPTER II.-Trilbi's Coup de Bwbitrap.
THE following passage is extracted from the diary of AYLwin NIR-
Wynne :-
Llanberis, Thursday.-This has been a most unusually tryin
day. I confess that it was not without a sense of boredom that
started on foot, after a hasty breakfast, bound for the summit of
Snowdon, and escorted by TRILBI, who carried her basswn, a
luncheon-basket for three, and a clasp-knife to cut out her heart
with in case the dukkeripens went wrong. I had suggested the
mountain railway, but TRILBI had menaced me in the region of
the belt with a left-hand teazer from the shoulder unless I did as
the dukkeripen told me.
Frankly, all this Romany rot was getting on my nerves. It
seems there was WINNIE's ãº, that said she was to marry
me; and TRILBI's dukkeripen that said she (TRILBI) was to lose
her heart to a Gorgio—meaning me, though there was a full-
blooded Gypsy high up on a branch of my family tree. Now,
when dukkeripens disagree, honest Christians are supposed to
come by their own. Still, the odds had an air of being against me
in view of my recent trials. You see, when you get engaged to a
girl, say, at Cromer, and the same evening her father desecrates
your father's tomb, and takes a family carbuncle off his chest,
with a curse attached; and then is found stark dead in a landslip
with the carbuncle on his own chest, curse being handed down
to next-of-kin; and his daughter goes off her head, and is subse-
quently heard of in North Wales, and then seen selling daisies in a
% outside the Haymarket Theatre; and then goes and sits for
“Lot's Wife” and “ The Pursuit of Innocence” alternately, accord-
ing as she is in or out of a fit: and finally can't get out, but is
taken home to Wapping and dies, and is traced to a pauper's
grave;—well, you don't expect, after this, to meet her one fine
...; walking up a precipice on Snowdon in the pink of health
and re to marry you at any moment,

before, at tea-time, she had suddenly become rigid, and assumed
the semblance of “Lot's Wife,” and recited correctly the curse
that went with my family carbuncle; for all the world as if she
and WINNIE had :*: themselves. To tell the trywth (as they
spell it in these parts) this rather unhinged me; and after an
i. night I should much have preferred, as I said, to take
the train.
But ah! that ascent l I have no space to describe it, but it is
given in Baedeker, I hope with an asterisk. Suffice to say that
when we reached the Knockers' Llyn the mountain, as so often
happens, was silhouetted against the sky.
* Hear that ?” cried TRILBI, “Them's the dukkeripens knockin'
their heads together. That's why us calls it Knockers' Llyn.
I've seed the spirits at it.”
Calculating, as I did, the capabilities of the left biceps of this
passionate Titaness even in her samer moments, I forebore to
correct either her grammar or her facts. The noise came, of
course, from the blasting at the slate quarries. But I humoured
her, hinting that I heard the Knockers very well.
“Now for my basswn!” said TRILBI; “and I'll raise a livin'
mullo for our feast !” The prospect of adding to our baskets this
toothsome fish—for such I took it to be—was a source of solace;
and I awaited eventualities.
In ten minutes. by my watch, the effect of the basswn, with solo,
began to work. Up the side of the precipice, in an opalescent haze
and a serge walking-dress, came the curiously lifelike figure of
WINIFRED WYNNE. I imagined myself to be the victim of an
illusory cinematograph.
“My dear Henry, how do you do?” she said, as naturally as
one could wish. Raising my hat, I replied, “An hallucina-
tion, I presume 2 " The prolonged embrace which ensued, almost
too sacred for words, convinced me that my credulity was
groundless.
“This waist is real!” I exclaimed, and I still think it was a
beautiful thing to say.
“This is indeed a pleasing surprise,” remarked WINIFRRp. “I
quite understood you were living with a Gypsy-woman in a bunga-
ow.”

quite a quantity of news for me, and I want my luncheon. Push
on, dear one, if you please.”
Clearing her throat, my love began to talk like the very best
kind of book. Although the period of what I will call her absent-
mindedness (covering a lapse of something under five years) was a
blank, from the day when her sacrilegious father's corpse sat up
in the landslip with a carbuncle round its neck, to the hour when
she perceived two manly feet—since shown to be TRILBI's, -
mysteriously º from behind a screen in D'ANTY's
country residence, the lecture she delivered on the remaining
ortion of her recent career was so exhaustive in its elaborate
§. its artistic observation, its verbatim reports of conver-
sation, that I am not ashamed to º that during the recitation
: * I yawned more than once in the direction of the luncheon
asket.
In reflecting upon the ornate rhetoric and poignant sympathy
of this remarkable speech, and comparing it with a letter of
D'ANTY's that I subsequently read, I can only conclude that she
must have memorized it from that gentleman's dictation. Had I
perused his letter in time—it lay at the moment unopened in my
ocket, where it had been forgotten in the general rush of
§º could have easily curtailed WINNIH's recitation
and got on earlier to the luncheon. This meal. I may add,
eventually proved to be my wedding breakfast, WINNIE's duk-
keripen having got the better of TRILBI's. I append an extract
from D’ANTY's composition—a model of the epistolary method—
in which the solution of the two great associated mysteries of
WINNIE's cure and the apparition of the protruding legs is shewn
to be quite easy when you know how it is done.

famous Dr. SvFNGALI, whose powers of magnetic mesmerism had
become known to me through the historic monograph of the late
Mr. DU MAURIER. It appears that by the Saltpetre cure it is
feasible, under hypnotic tension, assisted by a powerful magnet, to
take the disease of a patient suffering from disorderly hallucina-
tions and transplant it into the receptive system of a healthy
victim, with the result that the original owner of the malady is
made whole, while the new proprietor, by the exercise of tact,
easily throws off this temporary incubus.
Now, our º friend, .#A. I had been anxious t;
secure as model for my picture of “Peneloponnesa,” very generous
placed herself at our #: in this matter, saying in her .
and picturesque way that she “did not care a brass balanser how
many Gorgio cusses we stuffed her with.” In the result, the
simplicity of our experiment was only equalled by its success.
Placing the two subjects on parallel couches, with a sundering
screen which rendered them invisible to one another, save for the
F." of TRILBI's admirable feet, Dr. SvenGALI emitted
ypnotic influences; then, by the aid of a brain-pump and an
exceptionally potent magnet, larger, on the one hand, than the
common kind which attracts needles, but smaller, on the other hand,
than the Horse-shoe Fall at Niagara, he effected the transfer to
everybody's satisfaction. , Miss WYNNE was at once rendered sane,
though, if I may say so, less interesting; while TRILBI's recovery
will be º: when she has worked off one outstanding fit; at
which, should you meet her in the neighbourhood of Snowdon,
I trust that you may have the pathological ºr. of assisting.
In conclusion, my dear AYLWINNIEWYNNE, I wish you a more
than tolerable honeymoon. And, if you will excuse the familiarity
of one who, having met you at ieast three times, probably knows
you better than you know yourself, I would remind you that
there are potentialities in the direction of spiritual influence over
the universe of matter more extraordinary and surprising than
you, with your material prejudices, would readily suppose.

many Gorgio cusses we stuffed her with.” In the result, the
simplicity of our experiment was only º: by its success.
Placing the two subjects on parallel couches, with a sundering
screen which rendered them invisible to one another, save for the
F. of TRILBI's admirable feet, Dr. SvengaLI emitted
ypnotic influences; then, by the aid of a brain-pump and an
exceptionally potent magnet, larger, on the one hand, than the
common kind which attracts needles, but smaller, on the other hand,
than the Horse-shoe Fall at Niagara, he effected the transfer to
everybody's satisfaction. Miss WYNNE was at once rendered sane,
though, if I may say so, less interesting; while TRILBI's recovery
will be complete when she has worked off one outstanding fit; at
which, should you meet her in the neighbourhood of Snowdon,
I trust that you may have the pathological happiness of assisting.
In conclusion, my dear AYLwin.NIEwYNNE, I wish you a more
than tolerable honeymoon. And, if you will excuse the familiarity
of one who, having met you at ieast three times, probably knows
you better than you know yourself, I would remind you that
there are potentialities in the direction of spiritual influence over
the universe of matter more extraordinary and surprising than
you, with your material prejudices, would readily suppose.
I am, my dear AYLwin NIEwyNNE, your candid Friend,

“MATTER 1 SEE THAT HINNERCENT BABBY THERE!

AYLWINNIEWYNNE; OR, THE ROMANY ROT.
(After Mr. Th-d-re W-tts-D-nt-n, by Mr. Punch's Depreciator.)
CHAPTER II.-Trilbi's Coup de Bwbitrap.
THE following passage is extracted from the diary of AYLwin NIR-
Wynne :-
Llanberis, Thursday.-This has been a most unusually tryin
day. I confess that it was not without a sense of boredom that
started on foot, after a hasty breakfast, bound for the summit of
Snowdon, and escorted by TRILBI, who carried her basswn, a
luncheon-basket for three, and a clasp-knife to cut out her heart
with in case the dukkeripens went wrong. I had suggested the
mountain railway, but TRILBI had menaced me in the region of
the belt with a left-hand teazer from the shoulder unless I did as
the dukkeripen told me.
Frankly, all this .." rot was getting on my nerves. It
seems there was WINNIE's dukkeripen that said she was to marry
me; and TRILBI's dukkeripen that said she (TRILBI) was to lose
her heart to a Gorgio—meaning me, though there was a
blooded Gypsy high up on a branch of my family tree. Now,
when dukkeripens disagree, honest Christians are supposed to
come by their own. Still, the odds had an air of being against me
in view of my recent trials. You see, when you get engaged to a
girl, say, at Cromer, and the same evening her father desecrates
your father's tomb, and takes a family carbuncle off his chest,
with a curse attached; and then is found stark dead in a landslip
with the carbuncle on his own chest, curse being handed down
to next-of-kin; and his daughter goes off her head, and is subse-
quently heard of in North Wales, and then seen selling daisies in a
% outside the Haymarket Theatre; and then goes and sits for
“Lot's Wife” and “ The Pursuit of Innocence” alternately, accord-
ing as she is in or out of a fit: and finally can't get out, but is
taken home to Wapping and dies, and is traced to a pauper's
grave;—well, you don't expect, after this, to meet her one fine
morning walking up a precipice on Snowdon in the pink of health
and re to marry you at any moment. No ordinary person by
merely playing on a Yº... basswn can produce these results. But
before, at tea-time, she had suddenly become rigid, and assumed
the semblance of “Lot's Wife,” and recited correctly the curse
that went with my family carbuncle; for all the world as if she
and WINNIE had º themselves. To tell the trvth (as they
spell it in these parts) this rather unhinged me; and after an
*..." night I should much have preferred, as I said, to take
e train.
But ah! that ascent l I have no space to describe it, but it is
given in Baedeker, I hope with an asterisk. Suffice to say that
when we reached the Knockers' Llyn the mountain, as so often
happens, was silhouetted against the sky.
"Hear that ?” cried TRILBI, “Them's the dukkeripens knockin'
their heads together. That's why us calls it Knockers' Llyn.
I've seed the spirits at it.”
Calculating, as I did, the capabilities of the left biceps of this
passionate Titaness even in her saner moments, I forebore to
correct either her grammar or her facts. The noise came, of
course, from the blasting at the slate quarries. But I humoured
her, hinting that I heard the Knockers very well.
“Now for my basswn!” said TRILBI; “and I'll raise a livin'
full- || mullo for our feast !” The prospect of adding to our baskets this
toothsome fish—for such I took it to be—was a source of solace;
and I awaited eventualities.
In ten minutes. by my watch, the effect of the basswn, with solo,
began to work. Up the side of the precipice, in an opalescent haze
and a serge walking-dress, came the curiously lifelike figure of
WINIFRED WYNNE. I imagined myself to be the victim of an
illusory cinematograph.
“My dear Henry, how do you do?” she said, as naturally as
one could wish. aising my hat, I replied, “An hallucina-
tion, I presume 2 " The prolonged embrace which ensued, almost
too sacred for words, convinced me that my credulity was
groundless.
“This waist is real!” I exclaimed, and I still think it was a
beautiful thing to say.
“This is indeed a pleasing surprise,
remarked WINIFRED.
“I
quite understood you were living with a Gypsy-woman in a bunga-
low.”
“An unworthy suspicion," I replied warmly, “engendered by

quite a 3. of news for me, and I want my luncheon. Push
on, dear one, if you please.”
Clearing her throat, my love began to talk like the very best
kind of book. Although the period of what I will call her absent-
mindedness (covering a lapse of something under five years) was a
blank, from the day when her sacrilegious father's tº. sat up
in the landslip with a carbuncle round its neck, to the hour when
she perceived two manly feet—since shown to be TRILBI's,
mysteriously º; from behind a screen in D’ANTY's
country residence, the lecture she delivered on the remaining
ortion of her recent career was so exhaustive in its elaborate
§. its artistic observation, its verbatim reports of conver-
sation, that I am not ashamed to say that during the recitation
: º I yawned more than once in the direction of the luncheon
asket.
In reflecting upon the ornate rhetoric and poignant sympathy
of this remarkable speech, and comparing it with a letter of
D'ANTY's that I subsequently read, I can only conclude that she
must have memorized it from that gentleman's dictation. Had I
perused his letter in time—it lay at the moment unopened in my
ocket, where it had been forgotten in the general rush of
šijº could have easily curtailed WINNIH's recitation
and got on earlier to the luncheon. This meal. I may add,
eventually proved to be my wedding breakfast, WINNIE's duk-
keripen having got the better of TRILBI's. I append an extract
from D’ANTY's composition—a model of the epistolary method—
in which the solution of the two great associated mysteries of
WINNIE's cure and the apparition of the protruding legs is shewn
to be quite easy when you know how it is done.
CHAPTHR III.-The Epistle of D'Anty.
- * -
HAVING been fortunate enough to witness the model's re-
animation, which, by a divine coincidence, not to be lightly
explained by the materialist, occurred, after a three-days' trance,
at the precise moment when I happened to be calling upon her-
for I had never wholly accepted the theory of her decease—I
caused her to be conveyed from her Wºn; apartments to the
comparative luxury of my country retreat. en sent for the
famous Dr. SvFNGALI, whose powers of magnetic mesmerism had
become known to me through the historic monograph of the late
Mr. DU MAURIER. It appears that by the Saltpetre cure it is
feasible, under hypnotic tension, assisted by a powerful magnet, to
take the disease of a patient suffering from disorderly hallucina-
tions and transplant it into the receptive system of a health
victim, with the result that the original owner of the malady is
made whole, while the new proprietor, by the exercise of tact,
easily throws off this temporary incubus.
Now, our i. frien i.A. I had been anxious to
secure as model for my picture o eneloponnesa,” very generousl
placed herself at our #: in this matter, saying in her .
and picturesque way that she “did not care a brass balanser how
many Gorgio cusses we stuffed her with.” In the result, the
simplicity of our experiment was only equalled by its success.
Placing the two subjects on parallel couches, with a sundering
screen which rendered them invisible to one another, save for the
rotrusion of TRILBI's admirable feet, Dr. SvengALI emitted
ypnotic influences; then, by the aid of a brain-pump and an
exceptionally potent magnet, larger, on the one hand, than the
common kind which attracts needles, but smaller, on the other hand,

Tiger-like, man and wife
amished, do tear and rend each other
there.
But come, thou Goddess, fair and kind,
Gorgeous in the gems of Ind,
Lapped in beauty, bred in health,
Hail, thou golden Goddess, Wealth
No longer let me wearied go
In jolting 'bus to Pimlico,
Nor travel that dark Stygian round,
Cavern'd in the Underground.
But let me, when men homeward hie,
In wingéd hansom westward fly,
Or let my spanking bays, still faster,
Convey me home, their lord and master.
Or, should Appetite remind
That as yet I have not dined,
Let me to the Club repair
When the chefs are busy there.
Man is human, and, they say,
He can dine but once a day,
But betwixt your pot-house steak
And the dinner I would take,
What a chasm l As for drink,
Show me the slave who dares to think
His miserable cider riant
A patch upon my Château-Brion.
Some love twist, and others brag
Of the pungent joys of shag.
Faugh! Bring me the weed that grew
: the waves of Cuba blue,
ellow'd to a tender age
In some cedar hermitage.
On downy couch reclinéd, I
Would watch the smoke clouds curling by,
Careless of all save idle themes—
So let me lie and dream sweet dreams 1
These delights if thou canst give,
Wealth, with thee I mean to live.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
“Well, After All—” (HUTCHINson), Mr. FRANKFort MooRE's
latest novel, might truthfully have been called “Better After All.”
One going through a series of experiences is ever prone to regard
the last as the best or the worst. Yielding to that human
infirmity, my Baronite, familiar with Mr. MooRE's latest works,
is disposed to think he here excels himself. Perhaps he doesn't.
Certainly he has done uncommonly well. The plot is admirably
constructed, its unsuspected secret preserved to the very last page,
where it is flashed forth in an effective scene. The study of the
woman whose Knight loves and rides away, leaving her faithfully
nourishing her affection to find him coming back after many years
utterly indifferent, is good. More lightly painted in, but not less
effective, is the figure of the faithless Knight, and his unfeigned un-
consciousness that he had made so deep a mark on a woman's heart.
Robespierre and the Red Terror (HUTCHINson) is an attractive-
looking book. The subject, always of deathless interest, is just now
freshly revived for the British reader by the play at the Lyceum.
A glance down its table of contents increased the zest with which
my Baronite approached it. But alack! Dr. JAN TEN BRINK, even
with the assistance of Mr. HEDEMAN's translation, cannot over-
come the obscuration, not to say the incoherency, of the Dutch
language as it strikes the unlearned Saxon. If Mynheer JAN TEN
BRINK is an average specimen of his race, in matters of narrative
the fault of the Dutch is lack of lucidity. There is no sequence in
his chapters, which begin anywhere and land the bewildered reader
nowhere particular.
Seven cities, we are told, contended for the honour of being the
dead HQMRR's birthplace: cities “through which, when living,
HoMER begged his bread.” At least seven religions and anti-
religions have claimed SHAksPEARE as their own. The Baron's
not evidence sufficient to show what SHARspeaRE's religious
opinions really were, or whether he really had any. But there is
enough evidence to show what they were not; and this has been
done in a very skilful and scholarly way by the late Mr. SIMPson
and the living Rev. S. Bowden, between them, in the volume
just published by Messrs. BURNS AND OATEs. By the very
simple and straightforward method of letting his writings speak
for themselves, they show clearly that “SHAkspeaRE was not on
the winning side in his day in politics or religion, that he carefull
avoided all those appeals to popular prejudice about monks º
nuns, popes and cardinals, which form the farcical element of so
IIlan Fº of his time; nay, more, that in adapting old plays he
carefully º: every satire of the ancient faith.” Beyond
that nothing is clear. He kept his convictions to himself, and said
“nothing to nobody,” which, in the Baron's experience, is rather
the way of people in the present, day, who, like him, are actors
first and dramatists afterwards. It may not be a very heroic way.
But it isn't every one who has a taste for martyrdom. This
Religion of Shakspeare is, in the Baron's judº a very clear,
candid, and conclusive bit of work. HE B. DE B.-W.
Noisy Dogs.-Lord SUFFIELD, when annoyed }. the barking of
dogs that rudely interrupted the flow of his lordship's eloquence,
told the secretary, according to the Daily Mail, “in somewhat
petulant tones” to “ § those dogs, barking.” His lordship
naturally was hurt to think that any of his audience should lose a
syllable of his speech. He might have said, Shakspearianly, when
“Ope my lips, let no dog bark!” or, from the gentle Dr. WArts,
he could have smilingly quoted, with gracious condescension,
“Let dogs delight
To bark,”

opinion is that in no case has the claim been made out. There is
and then his lordship's speech might have “been taken as read.”

THERE's A THUN-
OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday, June 8.-A mad night, my masters, at the Opera.
MELBA as Lucy, not “W.H.” “of that ilk,” but “of Lammermoor.”
Too hot to be very lunatic, so Madame MELBA, singing splendidly
(ca wa sans dire, naturally, as it's all vocal), was sana in corpore
sano, and just about as mad as a bonnet-maker in comparison with
a hatter. Great ladies' night; the weaker sex being engaged in
diplomatically dining, in order to celebrate Her Majesty's birthday.
. SALĀzA, “scotched and kilt,” was excellent as Edgardo.
Henceforth, “ M. SALĀzA” must be translated as “MAG SALézA.”
Delightful to hear once again “The old, old song,” and the familiar
DoNize TTI “toons,” that have been for the better part of this
century sung by the finest of voices, played by the grandest of
orchestras, chorussed by the most powerful of choruses, ground to
powder by organ-men, blown to bits by brazen German bands,
and after all this, still the compositions come up as strong as ever,
with MRIBA, our “Advance Australia” prima-donna, to infuse into
them additional vitality. So “on they goes again.” The fact that
the “Fourth of June” was being celebrated at Eton on this night (the
3rd), and that the Hºly festivities were rampaging everywhere
“round the town,” and that the weather was prematurely warm,
all this ought to have had an appreciable effect on the quantity
and quality of the audience. "But it hadn't. Every one was
enthusiastic, and every one did their best, not forgetting “Sweet
Alice,” played in her most amiably sympathetic style by Mlle.
BAUERMEISTER.
Monday-Faust. “Ici (ce soir) on parle français.” MELBA, the
two DE REszkEs, Mlle. OLITZKA (a name that somewhat recalls
Mazeppa, only his young lady was Olinska), BAUERMEISTER-Singer
of course, and Monsieur ALBERs, all singing in French. Therefore,
this being an educational performance, the operatic management
makes an extra charge; and on Tuesday night again, for Die
Walküre, up goes the price of stalls, just five shillings' worth more
yalue than on the Faust night. We wish they may get it, and we
hope they do. Make hay while the sun shines; as you make your
hay so you must lie on it, with other proverbial philosophy at
the Operatic *ś option, while yet the National Opera
House is only “in the air”—but it's an air that is likely to become
very popular. Poor JEAN DE REszKE! Does any one remember the
linen-draper's advertisement, “Try our stout Jean”? Well, that
is what the hot weather did to-night; it “tried our stout JEAN;”
so, M. SALEzA was his most excellent remplacant. Then Signor
ANCONA replaced the absent ALBERs, and being a thoroughly
dramatic artist, the part did not suffer.
- Thursday.ºhange of weather. Cool night. Cool audience,
apparently taking as a matter of no particular importance the
revival of MozART's delightful Don, represented on this occasion by
a first-rate singer, but no “great shakes” as an actor, Signor Scotti,
who, as Mr. Vincent Crummles might have written in a local paper,
despite his name, does not come from North of the Tweed, having
been born in Naples. EDouard DE REszkE as Leporello and
M. GILLIBERT as Masetto were the too not very “low” comedians,
each of 'em being about six feet high; Edouard being all that, and
a trifle to spare. Their “business,” which is evidently a pleasure
to them, was the “conventional comic” of old Italian Opera which
still causes not a few simple-minded people to smile. Edouard's
singing was faultless. Mlle. ZELIE DE LUssan was, as heretofore,
a charmingly skittish Zerlina, who, with a few years more experi-
ence of this wicked world, might develope into a Carmen. Madame
NordicA crowned her former success as Donna Elvira; and LILLI
I.EHMANN-a “lilli” most artistically painted without injury to her
lilliship–excellent as Donna Anna. . SALIGNAc as Don Ottavio
performed excellently the most trying part of male chaperon (with
*...* and a song) to the wicked Don's two sadly deceived black
sheep.
Friday.—Flying Dutchman: his last flight this season.
** Little Fish are Sweet.”
UNTIL to-day, excepting “camlet,”
Where was the word to rhyme with “Hamlet 2"
But now in Times, June 6, there's “samlet.”

“Salle ERARD" is a distinguished rival of “SARAH BERNBARDT.”

ANOTHER CONFERENCE.
A FEw days ago my neighbour Jones
came to my house, and demanded to see
me. I saw him. He was very angry. He
said my cat had scratched up some of the
best flowers in his garden. TI told him I
was very sorry, but I really could not
exercise much control over the cat. He
remarked that I should not need to do
much in that way for the future, seeing
what a little remained of my cat after the
intervention of his dog, but that that was
not the q". which was, how about
his ruined flowers? This roused me, and
I called him a cowardly ruffian to set a
savage dog on a poor, feeble cat. Where-
upon the conversation became general, so
to speak, and continued on the same terms
after Jones had picked himself up at the
bottom of my front steps, and was shaking
his fist at me from the other side of the
garden gate, a performance which I per-
ceived somewhat indistinctly since my left
eye had been temporarily closed by his
right hand.
As Jones, still addressing me, entered his
own house, our mutual friend ToMKINs came
along. “Hullo, SMITH,” he asked, “what
on earth's the matter?” I told him. I
also gave him to understand that the next
part of the performance would be in the
police court. Had we been Parisians,
swords or pistols would have settled the dis-
ute. ..." Stuff and nonsense, my dear
ellow,” he said, “don’t make fools of your-
selves in public. The last fashion in
quarrels is not a summons or a duel, but a
conference.” After a long argument he
convinced me. Then he went to see Jones.
An immense time ºl. during which I
bathed my eye at intervals. At last ToMKINs
came in. “It's all right,” he said, “I’ve
convinced him at last. You meet at my
house to-morrow evening after dinner, say
nine o'clock.”
I went. ToMKINs is rather fond of cere-
monious meetings. He is chairman of a
company, is on the committee of two clubs,
and sometimes presides at public dinners.
I was ushered into his library, as it is called.
He had arranged three chairs round the
table, and pens, ink, and ºp. on it. He
sat at the end; Jones an at each side.
Jones had a 5. bump on his forehead
and seemed to have sprained his left wrist,
but I fancy my black eye was more notice.
able than his injuries. He and I were coldly
distant in demeanour.
ToMKINs began the discussion. He said
it was a very unfortunate dispute, origin-
ating in a somewhat trifling mischance.
(Here Jones and I cried “No, no!” at the
same moment.) Well, perhaps not trifling,
but still arbitration, was better than any
appeal to force. If either could suggest
any compensation— Here Jones said he
wouldn't have taken five pounds for those
flowers, and I said that I valued that cat
far beyond any mere shop price, whereupon
the wretched Jones remarked that she
wouldn't be worth much at any shop now,
and I was only checked by ToMKINs, who
suggested that the question only needed
to be thoroughly discussed, to be thrashed
out— But the word “thrashed” was an
unfortunate one to use, and it was nearly a
quarter of an hour before he could paci
that howling cad Jones, who spoke so #:#;
that I could hardly make myself heard even
by shouting.
After this ToMKINs finished his opening
speech rather abruptly, and invited JonEs,
whose name in alphabetical order came be.

Mrs. LITTLE means—that she is not a mere globe-trotter, but has
really lived in China, and has studied the people in their home-
life in regions rarely visited by a European. The result is a series
of vivid pictures, the word-painting assisted by some of the most
successful and interesting photography yet presented in a book.

sources and openings, the naval and military armaments of China.
Mrs. LITTLE comes along and tells us how the Chinese live at

the whole the testimony is favourable, throwing a flood of light on
this still scantily-known human bee-hive.
Mr. ALFRED Lubbock's Memories of Eton and Etonians (John
MURRAY) will be found most interesting by those whom it specially
concerns. The materials gathered b e memorialist are com-
paratively so scanty, that its title might have been more correctly
iven as “Short Memories.” Mr. LUBBock, one of the many
UBBocks mazimi, majores, minimi, and minimissimi, whose
names appear on Etonian School-lists, went to the college in 1854
to take his place in “Lower School,” and left in 1863, when, as he
says, he could yet have remained a couple of years, seeing that he
was only eight years of age when he went there. Nowadays, as
the Baron is informed, boys are not admitted until they have
attained the ripe age of twelve. Mr. LUBBock devotes himself
chiefly to cricket and cricketers, though occasional reference is
made to “the boats,” which constitute the feature in the recreation
of the great Public School. The Captain of the Eleven is undis-
tinguished by any uniform, whereas the Captain of the Boats is
gorgeous, but even he pales before the glories of the real little live
admiral with cocked hat, sword, pumps, and pink silk stockings,
who condescends to steer the Monarch. It may be that most of the
stories of HAWTREY, CookEsley, BETHEL the Bursar, PLUMPTRE,
and others, Mr. LUBBock put aside as too well known to bear repeti-
tion. Perhaps so. The book, however, will command the atten-
tion of Public School cricketers generally, and being evidently
animated throughout by the most sincere affection for “the Old
Place,” it is sure of a hearty welcome from all young, elderly, or
old Etonians.

PINERO'S “POP.”
THE spirited author of The Gay Lord Quez was *. by the
happy thought of introducing on to the stage, in the course of
the third act of this piece, a bottle of “fizz,” in order to add to the
sparkle of his already brilliant dialogue. Lord Q. tastes the wine
and F. it; so does somebody else in the play, the lady, if we
ightly remember, whom he comes to visit at night on the occasion
when they have this bottle of “Pop" between them. We are
reminded of the Pop-ularity of this comedy by receiving a wine-
merchant's advertising circular quoting Mr. PINERo's introduction
of this brand into his play as a special recommendation of it to
public favour.
All the world knows that Mr. SIMs, Dramatic Author, has con-
ferred a benefit on those whom Providence has afflicted with
baldness by his invention of a “capillary attraction” or “extrac-
tion” which, we believe, has achieved an almost world-wide repu-
tation, and which may be handed down in bottles as a Hair-loom
through many generations. What is the “next article" that our
dramatic authors will place before the public? In the glorious
days of old Christmas Pantomime, the clown used to exhibit some
elaborate “tricks,” which were boldly labelled as advertisements,
and, like those painted on the scenes and once, only once, on a
“ curtain,” were, we believe, regularly paid for as such, just as
the proprietors would have paid for “spaces” on hoardings and
in railway stations.
If this fashion be generally adopted by our present dramatists who
will find “spaces” in their dialogue for allusions to wine-merchants,
hair-dressers, tailors, upholsterers, &c., &c., then the sharp
. producing a Shakspearian play ought to derive a con-
siderable profit from similar introductions into the text of the
“Divine WILLIAMs,” which is full of “modern instances.” Macbeth's
“So foul and fair a day,” might afford a chance for references to
barometers, or to the manufacturer of waterproof coats and capes.
“Stands Scotland where it did?” will serve as a text whereon to
hang the time-tables of excursionist holiday tickets and cheap
fares. “I know a bank'' is evidently suggestive; so also, “How
far that little candle throws his beams" would bring out the ad-
vantages of electric lighting; while, Hamlet's mention of his “inky
cloak” and “suit of sables” would offer first-rate chances to the
providers of mourning and seal-skin mantles and wraps.
In fact, a Shakspearian revival would be a very mine of
advertising wealth to any manager who should take the straight
tip for tap (if he went in for wine) from ARTHUR Bees-WING
PINRRo, our premier dramatic author. Acting managers, too,
must be on the look out for drams for dramas, und by assistance of
stage manager, and by kind permission of manager and author,
these allusions could be worked in at rehearsal.

PUNCH, OR
A CONTRAST.
MR. Bigwig, THE EMINENT Q.C., AND
PINERO'S “POP.”
THE spirited author of The Gay Lord Quez was *. by the
happy thought of introducing on to the stage, in the course of
the third act of this piece, a bottle of “fizz,” in order to add to the
sparkle of his already brilliant dialogue. Lord Q. tastes the wine
and praises it; so does somebody else in the play, the lady, if we
rightly remember, whom he comes to visit at night on the occasion
when they have this bottle of “Pop” between them. We are
reminded of the Pop-ularity of this comedy by receiving a wine-
merchant's advertising circular quoting Mr. PINERo's introduction
of this brand into his play as a special recommendation of it to
public favour.

THE LION OF THE SEASON'S WADE MECUM,
Question. What is the necessary attribute of a Lion of the
Season 2
Answer. An interesting personality.
Q. What may that be?
4. Something sufficiently out of the common to attract
curiosity.
Q. Does it matter in what shape the novelty appears ?
4. Very little, as society votes variety to be charming.
Q. Is a literary Lion nowadays popular 2
4. Not very, as most people write books.
Q. Then a man or woman who had not composed a novel at
some time or another would be a distinct novelty?
A. Certainly; but then such a person would be handicapped by
the probability of being extremely stupid.
Q. But ... it is stupid to write a bad novel?
A. $. so, but stupider not to be able to write at all.
Q. Then what is the best mode of becoming a Lion ?
4. By discovering a new continent or suffering imprisonment
amongst cannibals for five or six years.

Martyn's play, “The Heather Field.”)
CHOOSE for your scene an Irish bog.
Among brutal Saxons the theory still lingers
that Ireland is all bog, and this will give
vraisemblance to your picture. If you re-
quire an Interior, an Irish cabin will be most
appropriate, for there is another curious
superstition on this side of the St. George's
Channel, that all Irishmen live in cabins.
For the subject of your drama select
something gloomy and Scandinavian. It
is true that the Times says that “Lunacy
and surface drainage are not cheerful sub-
#. for drama,” but your Celt knows better.
verything depends on the treatment. Did
not IBSEN contrive a drama of enthralling
interest on the subject of the drainage of a
watering-place? And they say IBSEN is a
Scotsman by descent, which is next door to
being a Celt. -
Let your characters be crazy or neurotic.
You will find IBssn's works a perfect store-
house of these, and if you “lift "one or two
of them nobody is likely to detect the theft.
Rita Allmers, or Mrs. Borkman, or that
sweet thing, Hedda Gabler, would all come
in useful, and, as your scene is an Irish .
there is an obvious opening for a Wild Duck.
If the plot of your play is gloomy, the
dialogue should §: even gloomier. Irish
humour would be quite out of place on this
occasion. No one must flourish a shillelah
or sing “Killaloe” to lighten up the pro-
ceedings, and the stirring strains of “The
banished. This paramount necessity for
gloom will probably place you in a some-
what difficult position, and may make it
necessary for you to banish the Irish brogue
altogether from your cast. Long experience
has shown that a Saxon audience invariably
associates a brogue with latent humour, and
if anybody laughed it would be all up with
the Celtic Renascence.
In writing Celtic drama you should choose
our critics with some care. Mr. GEORGE
ooBE is somewhat headstrong for the
purpose, and his eulogies will be apt to pro-
voke the smile which it is your first duty to
banish from the faces of your audience.
Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER would be your best
card, if you could persuade him to take a
favourable view of your dramatic work-
manship. But if you failed in this (as the
author of The Heather Field did), I am
afraid you will have to fall back upon the
smaller fry of the Dublin Press. This will
be one of those distressing cases of the
prophet who is only honoured in his own
country.
When your play has been written and
roduced, let me earnestly counsel you to
ave it translated into Norwegian. This
will enable Great Britain to make some
return for the inestimable boon of Scandi-
navian drama under which she has lon
been groaning. It will also be playing o
an excellent jest on Herr IBsºn, who is
believed to be somewhat bored with the
adulation of his admirers in this country.

House of Commons, Monday, June 5.-
A crowded House with some distinguished
strangers in the Gallery. Whether “Bobs”
brought KITCHENER to watch the fray, or
whether KITCHENER brought “Bobs” is not
known. However it be, there they sat,
neither in the least resembling familiar
ictures of NAPoleon Crossing the Alps,
§. Sirdar, tanned with the fierce sum of
the Soudan, looked like a bronze image

Mrs. KRUGER; will have none of Don José's

Well, here was RITCHIE discovered at the
Table, doubtless the bearer of some porten-
tous message. House hushed; members
strained forward lest they should lose a
syllable of the Minister's speech.
“Sir,” said RITCHIE, turning to the
SPEAKER, whose trained composure was
scarcely equal to the strain of the moment,
“I beg to ask leave to introduce a bill
dealing with undersized fish.”
House relieved from vague apprehension
of evil, broke into almost hysterical laughter.
PRINCE ARTHUR smiled in pleased apprecia-
tion of success of his little joke. TSeems
easy to do, but requires a good deal of
thinking out. Effective point was of course
to place this particular bill in hands of the
biggest man on Treasury Bench. First
thoughts turned to CHAPLIN. After Cabinet

“All very well,” said SARK, “but these
little successes are sometimes purchased at
disproportionate cost. We've heard of the
Ministry of All the Talents. How would it
be if, on review of its general course of
legislation, the third administration of Lord
SALISBURY were known in history as The
Undersized Fish Ministry?”
Business done.—Vote of Thanks to the
Army in the Soudan.
Friday.—“Really,” said PRINCE ARTHUR,
when JEMMy Low THER once more brought
on the subject of Peers interfering with
elections to the House of Commons, “the
importunate widow is not in it with my
right hon, friend.”
This sally a great success, but on closing
night of busy week JEMMY has grounds for
reflection that he has saved the State. Wed-
nesday afternoon was wild enough, with its
gutting of the Service Franchise Bill, its
triumphant passing through Committee of
the apparently doomed Half-Timers Bill,
its near risk of establishing Sunday Closing,
and the narrow escape of Scotland from
burning deck, whence all but he had fled.
Treasury Bench deserted save for beaming
presence of JEsse Collings. But what was
he among so many? Opposition, rampant
with audacity, radiant with success, pre-
ared to c all before them. JEMMY, with

Head fronting the turbulent Channel, im-
moveable, magnificent. Again and again
the wave of revolution surged round him;
temporarily submerged in the cases cited;
but think of all he averted.

This Is MR. DENIs O'BRIEN, who claims DEscENT FROM THE
ANCIENT KINGs of IRELAND. But his PRETENSIONs JUST Now Do
NOT SOAR ABOVE HALF A CROWN.
“SARAH'S YOUNG MAN.”
Evidently Mme. SARA's view of Hamlet's character is that this
youthful Prince, now aged about eighteen, had been as a precocious
child badly *...* up by his injudicious mother, petted by his
nurses, and spoilt by tutors, governors, and servants. Doubt.
less Polonius had frequently been charged with the care of the
young Prince, and, of course, had allowed Ophelia and the heir
to the crown of Denmark to be thrown a good deal together as boy
and girl. The poor old Lord Chamberlain suffered for this culpable
weakness in after years, as Hamlet laughs at him to his face,
chaffs him in company, and actually, when his lordship is seriously
and respectfully addressing his youthful master, the latter, like the
comic countryman in Mr. Crummles' theatre, pretends to be catch-
ing a fly, which he finally captures with both hands on the old
man's mouth | Isn't that the very act of a mischievous, spoilt
Prince?, And how appropriately would come from his lips the
remark that if ..º. one were treated “according to his deserts,
who would escape whipping 2 ”
This is Madame SARA BERNHARDT's Hamlet. She shows him
as from gay, to grave, from lively to severe. He is sharp as a
needle, he will speak daggers, but will not use so much as a bare
b . His lecture to the professional players, impertinent even
from an older Prince, is an exhibition of boyish conceit. Yet is
SARA's Hamlet, with all her gaminerie, far nearer the ideal Hamlet
than any Hamlet, including FEGHTER's, that this deponent has
ever seen. All other Hamlets—the male Hamlets, bien entendu—
have been, in comparison with “SARAH's Young Man,” eccentric
*. youths of from thirty to fifty.
From the point of view of Hamlet's being an entirely spoilt child,
of the play-scene is of course possible, otherwise, in any well-
regulated Court, the monkey tricks of even so exalted a personage
as the young Crown Prince would meet with severe and immediate
rebuke from his mother. With Ophelia, who is a knowing young
lady just about a year or so older than Hamlet, and a past mis-
tress of arts and crafts, an apt pupil of sly old Father Polonius,
SARA's Hamlet, toujours l'enfant gåté, is delightful. With the Queen
he is a bully, just the retribution that a vain, silly mother might
expect. In the course of the piece, SARA's Hamlet becomes more
dignified, and when he is confronted with that egregious ass, Osric,
he is as serious with him as he had been playful with Polonius.
In the fencing scene SARA's Young Man is a master of the art,
and her business of whisking Laertes' sword out of his hand, and
courteously proffering her own for his acceptance is the only
rationally j explanation of the exchange of weapons as
devised by SHAKSPEARE. All this is excellent.
CHACUN A SON GOUT.
[“A writer in the Toynbee Record claims for East London an aesthetic
beauty of its own. How could any sane man prefer the prim, dismal stucco
of a West London square?”—Daily Paper.]
IF you wish to be chic, you will doubtless agree
No place is so fair as the district marked E,
But, however my Philistine judgment may trouble you,
I confess to an old-fashioned weakness for W.
There may be whose noses do ardently wish
To sample the savoury joys of fried fish;
Let them to Whitechapel, but give me the breeze
That rustles the leaves of the Serpentine trees.
Your 'ARRY be-buttoned and 'ARRRET too
Are sights to be seen like the Tower and the Zoo;
But still I prefer, in the matter of mode,
Your Kensington Gardens to Whitechapel Road.
But I quarrel with no one; chacun d son gout;
A pestilent slum has attractions for you,
But I'll be content with a flat in Mayfair,
Or a family mansion in Grosvenor Square.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
'Postle Farm (BLAckwooD), by GEORGE FoRD, is the most power-
ful novel my Baronite has read for a long time. The casual
reader need not be repelled by discovery that the heroine and
some of her early companions speak in the Devonshire dialect. It
looks bad, but it is easily comprehended, and soon grows to be
musical. Cathie is quite a new departure among novel heroines,
real flesh and blood fashioned into profoundly interesting life by
skilful hands. The-picture has for setting the lush lanes, green
fields, and bordering sea of Devon, peopled with º&#.
Granfer, the owner of 'Postle Farm, is particularly ightful.
“GeoRGE” Ford the wise call the author. There are some subtle
touches in the portraiture of Cathie that to my Baronite bewray
the woman.
To his British Anthologies, in itself a library of delight, Mr.
FRowde adds three volumes, issued from the Oxford University
Press. The first covers the field of time SHAKSPEARE marked
as his own. From 1617 to 1637, rare BEN Jonson and his
contemporaries pay tribute. The third is the Milton Anthology,
datin }. 1638 to 1674. In this last we find flowers culled
from CowLEY, BEAUMonT, FLETCHER, SYDNEY GoDolph IN, GeoRGE
HERBERT, PEMBRoKE, HERRICK, MAssINGER, WALTER RALEIGH,
SucKLING, GEoRGE WITHER, and, of course, MILTON. One often
thinks what book he would take to a desert island if his choice
were limited to a single work. My Baronite plumps for the
British Anthologies, of which there are to be ten volumes in all,
covering four centuries of British poesy. It is a happy thought,
admirably carried out under the editorship of Professor AREER.
The publisher contributes the charm of cunningly selecting Black
Letter and a tone of rough paper that gives the volume a faded
look, as if it had come from the private possession of the Reverend
RoBERT HERRICK or Colonel RICHARD LovELACE.
In Orientations (FISHER, UNwin), Mr. SomeRSET MAugham tells
some short stories in a style which, though peculiar to himself,
reminds me at one time of the cynicism of THACKERAY, and at
another of the pleasant humour of DICKENs. Not that Mr.
MAUGHAM is in the least degree either plagiarist or imitator. Per-
haps in this collection of tales the sketch entitled “The Punctilious-
ness of Don Sebastian” is the most graphic, the most picturesque,
and certainly not the least amusing in the volume. “Faith” were
better omitted. “De Amicitia” is very good, though the finish is
weakened by the author's evident dislike of the usual “so they
married and lived happily ever after" termination.

the Westry. To beat them properly it is necessary to enter a cage in the Zoo
where a hippopotamus lives. After discussion it was resolved to let the matter
rest.”—The Globe.]
WHICH I wish to put it simple-like and clear,
And the same it didn't ought to be forgot,
If you want to find a perilous career,
Why, a Beadle's is the wussest of the lot;
For it’s “What a howdy-dowdyl Here's them paupers gettin'
rowdy,
Ani the males is all refract'ry, 'cos the food ain't satisfact'ry,
While the females is that silly, they're refusin' of their skilly,”
And you've always got to be upon the spot.
Now, I ain't afraid of nuthink, no, not me !
As a man, a 'uman man, I'm brave enough,
For I’ve sometimes drunk a cup of paupers' tea,
And I’ve even ate a plateful of plum-duff,
But there's limits 1 When the fuss is over hippopotamuses
With a mouth wot's like a chasm, why, it damps your 'thusiasm,
And I'd like to see the man’ll swallow that job—even DAN'L
With his lions would have found it rather tough.
Yus, though unbeknown to terror, and I takes
To danger, like a crowner to a 'quest,
When I looks upon this hanimal, I shakes
Till my big 'eart is bustin' through my breast.
Which I’ll beat the bounds with any, but there ain't not very many
Wot will plunge into the cages wheer sich monstersramps and rages,
So, while beggin' of their pardins for advisin' of the Guardi'ns,
I'd suggest that they should let the matter rest.
ANother DICTIONARY.-An advertisement appears in the Times
of a “FUNK AND WAGNALLs Co.'s English Dictionary.” As
BULwer's Cardinal Richelieu observes, “There's no such word
as ‘Fail,'” so, written in English character, there ought to be
“no such word as ‘Funk.’” Such a book as this, partly com-
tº. by a FUNK, might cause a panic in the City. Perhaps the
ag in WAGNALLs counteracts the effect. Be it so. You can

MINOR TROUBLES.
I.—Our Secretary.
BEING a young author, with a young wife,
who expects a good deal of my society—
assistance in choosing her dresses, etc.—I
thought it would be well to have a secretary
to help me with the more laborious part of
my work; but I have long regretted that I
ever engaged one. I find I waste several
hours of every day in trying to think of some-
thing for the secretary to do. He is far too
willing, too industrious and eager for work.
He is always talking about “method,” and
has a habit of continually “making lists”
that annoys me acutely. . He is an excellent
type-writer, and always longing to exercise
this art. Certainly I have written very
little since he has been here, and it is
doubtful if I ever shall do much during his
stay. When I retire to my study—a dim
little retreat, furnished principally with
tobacco, and boots, and with a delightful
view of roofs from the window—I have
hardly been there two hours when he will
look in and find me still reading the Dail
Mail. When I came down, my wife woul
ay—
“Well, dear, have you had a good morn-
ing's work?” and I would answer, “Oh,
vº fair—very fair, indeed.”
ut now the secretary rushes up after me,
and finds nothing on my desk but a piece of
beautiful clean blotting-paper. Then he
looks reproachful. We are both always
inventing absurd errands for him—to get
him out of the way. He is sent on missions
what is the latest moment until which my
wife can support existence without her
new hat. Once I lent him to a musical
friend, to help to get up a “Benefit.” We
did not see him for weeks, and we greatly
enjoyed the holiday. He takes our dog out
for a walk every day. I have found him
reading aloud to my wife the “Answers to
Correspondents” in The Queen while she
worked. She told me she thought it was a
kindness to give him something useful to do.
In his leisure moments—some twenty-
three hours—he answers the acrostics in
Tit-Bits, but I have never heard of his
gaining a prize. To show the bad effect his
F. has on my art, the last few weeks
have had some excellent ideas for poems,
I may mention that I have already brought
out a small volume called Foam-Flowers,
which made some little sensation. Indeed,
the criticisms it received were not those
bestowed on the first comer. Not that they
were fulsome, nauseating praise. And, by
the way, one of the most irritating things
my secretary ever did was to collect all the
reviews and paste them neatly in a book.
Separately, they had seemed not uncom-
limentary—when taken in the right spirit.
ut together, they were depressing in a
certain universality of opinion. I began a
poem to be called The Judgment Day, which
seemed a lºf subject and suitable for a
fine work. had written the following
four lines of the first stanza:
“Under the versi-coloured tissue
Over the fulgent, bickering marge,
Stand in the participrocate twilight
I was pleased with this opening, and my
wife also admired it, though she said she
feared it was “too deep” for the general
public. I went out in the fresh air, to rest
afterwards; and when I came in, I found
these four lines neatly type-written; I was
absolutely unable to think of another line
in consequence, and was obliged to abandon
what might have been a remarkable epic.
However, I thought of something in an
entirely different style; a simple little thing,
a mere impression, called Candle-light.
It began thus—
“A cigarette; and the scent
Of a candle that has gone out.
And I would I knew where it went,
I, alone in darkness and doubt.
Dripping, pattering rain,
On the window-pane—
I had got so far when I was called away.
Of course, I came back to find it type-
ºn, and my inspiration nipped in the
u01.
I have just heard some good news. I
had sent my secretary to look for a country
house for us, that was to be neither old, nor
new, neither too large nor too small, quite
rustic and out in the country, but conveni-
ently near to town. I thought this would
.# him some time. He returned unsuc-
cessful and has just informed me he wishes
to resign his secretaryship. He finds life in
a flat too monotonous, and wishes to be a
war-correspondent.

BUMBLE'S LAMENT.
[“The boundaries of Marylebone parish are causing considerable bother to
the Westry. To beat them properly it is necessary to enter a cage in the Zoo
where a hippopotamus lives. After discussion it was resolved to let the matter
rest.”—The Globe.]
WHICH I wish to put it simple-like and clear,
And the same it didn't ought to be forgot,
If you want to find a perilous career,
Why, a Beadle's is the wussest of the lot;
For it’s “What a howdy-dowdy! Here's them paupers gettin'
rowdy,
Ani the males is all refract'ry, 'cos the food ain't satisfactºry,
While the females is that silly, they're refusin' of their skilly,”
And you've always got to be upon the spot.
Now, I ain't afraid of nuthink, no, not me !
As a man, a 'uman man, I'm brave enough,
For I’ve sometimes drunk a cup of paupers' tea,
And I’ve even ate a plateful of plum-duff.
But there's limits 1. When the fuss is over hippopotamuses .
With a mouth wot's like a chasm, why, it damps your 'thusiasm,
And I'd like to see the man’ll swallow that job-even DAN'L
With his lions would have found it rather tough.
Yus, though unbeknown to terror, and I takes
To danger, like a crowner to a 'quest,
When I looks upon this hanimal, I shakes
Till my big 'eart is bustin' through my breast.
Which I’ll beat the bounds with any, but there ain't not very many
Wot will plunge into the cages wheer sich monsters ramps and rages,
So, while beggin' of their pardins for advisin' of the Guardi'ns,
I'd suggest that they should let the matter rest.
ANother DICTIonARY.-An advertisement appears in the Times
of a “FUNK AND WAGNALLs Co.'s English Dictionary.” As
BULwer's Cardinal Richelieu observes, “There's no such word
as ‘Fail,'” so, written in English character, there ought to be
“no such word as ‘Funk.’” Such a book as this, partly com-
osed by a FUNK, might cause a panic in the City. Perhaps the
W. in WAGNALLs counteracts the effect. Be it so. You can
obtain it in “half Russia” for three sovereigns (the other “half
Russia” going ten shillings better), and in “full Morocco” the
Moors will do it for you at four guineas and five pounds.

MINOR TROUBLES.
I.—Our Secretary.
BEING a young author, with a young wife,
who expects a good deal of my society—
assistance in choosing her dresses, etc.—I
thought it would be well to have a secretary
to help me with the more laborious part of
my work; but I have long regretted that I
ever engaged one. I find I waste several
hours of every day in trying to think of some-
thing for the secretary to do. He is far too
willing, too industrious and eager for work.
He is always talking about “method,” and
has a habit of continually “making lists”
that annoys me acutely. He is an excellent
type-writer, and always longing to exercise
this art. Certainly I have written very
little since he has been here, and it is
doubtful if I ever shall do much during his
stay. When I retire to my study—a dim
little retreat, furnished º with
tobacco and boots, and with a delightful
view of roofs from the window—I have
hardly been there two hours when he will
look in and find me still reading the Dail
Mail. When I came down, my wife woul
say—
“Well, dear, have you had a good morn-
ing's work?” and I would answer, “Oh,
vº. fair—very fair, indeed.”
ut now the secretary rushes up after me,
and finds nothing on my desk but a piece of
beautiful clean blotting-paper. Then he
looks reproachful. We are both always
inventing absurd errands for him—to get
him out of the way. He is sent on missions
what is the latest moment until which my
wife can support existence without her
new hat. Once I lent him to a musical
friend, to help to get up a “Benefit.” We
did not see him for weeks, and we greatly
enjoyed the holiday. He takes our dog out
for a walk every day. I have found him
reading aloud to my wife the “Answers to
Correspondents” in The Queen while she
worked. She told me she thought it was a
kindness to give him something useful to do.
In his leisure moments—some twenty-
three hours—he answers the acrostics in
Tit-Bits, but I have never heard of his
gaining a prize. To show the bad effect his
F. has on my art, the last few weeks
have had some excellent ideas for poems,
I may mention that I have already brought
out a small volume called Foam-Flowers,
which made some little sensation. Indeed,
the criticisms it received were not those
bestowed on the first comer. Not that they
were fulsome, nauseating praise. And, by
the way, one of the most irritating things
my . ever did was to collect all the
reviews and paste them neatly in a book.
Separately, they had seemed not uncom-
limentary—when taken in the right spirit.
ut together, they were depressing in a
certain universality of opinion. I began a
poem to be called The Judgment Day, which
seemed a lºf subject and suitable for a
fine work. had written the following
four lines of the first stanza:
“Under the versi-coloured tissue
Over the fulgent, bickering marge,
Stand in the participrocate twilight
I was pleased with this opening, and my
wife also admired it, though she said she
feared it was “too deep” for the general
public. I went out in the fresh air, to rest
afterwards; and when I came in, I found
these four lines neatly type-written; I was
absolutely unable to think of another line
in consequence, and was obliged to abandon
what might have been a remarkable epic.
However, I thought of something in an
entirely different style; a simple little thing,

“JAM" NON “ SATIS.”
(A Lay of Medmenham, by a Broken-hearted Boating Man landing
from the Thames, who was informed that, by the rules of the Hotel,
visitors were not allowed jam with their tea if served in the garden.)
THERE's a river hotel that is known very well,
From the turmoil of London withdrawn,
Between Henley and Staines, where this strange rule obtains—
That you must not have jam on the lawn.
In the coffee-room still you may eat what you will,
Such as chicken, beef, mutton, or brawn,
Jam and marmalade too, but, whatever you do,
Don't attempt to eat jam on the lawn.
Young Jones and his bride sought the cool river side,
And she said, as she skipped like a fawn,
“As it is, it is nice, but 'twould be paradise,
Could we only have jam on the lawn!”
DIVIDENDS AND DRAMA,
At the first ordinary general meeting of the Lyceum Theatre
Co., Limited, Mr. CoMyns CARR presented Sir HENRY’s “cordial
ſº ” to the directors and shareholders, and the assurance that
e (Sir HENRY) was perfectly satisfied and contented, and under
the circumstances, in a general way as happy as possible, which,
of course, was “tidings of comfort and joy.” Then an inquisitive
shareholder wanted to know what the future arrangements might
be, and the astute Mr. CARR declined to be drawn on that delicate
subject. Then, another shareholder politely requested to be in-
formed “whether the receipts had £preciated in the absence,
through illness, of Sir HENRY IRVING 2'
Now this would have been a bit of a poser for any managing
director, however well qualified for the post; but Mr. CARR, more
than equal to the occasion, astutely replied that “of course Sir
HENRY's absence would always depreciate receipts in any theatre
in which he appeared as leading actor”—and he might have illus-
trated his remark by asking where would be the great attraction
of a Lion Show in the absence of the Lion ? However, without
j for parables that might have been out of place at a
usiness meeting, he went on to reassure the shareholder, with
as little damage as possible to the feelings of Sir HENRY, that
“the attractions of the play were such that the results were in the
mass entirely satisfactory.” An oracular utterance so admirably
adapted to the occasion that no other shareholder seems to have
troubled the “subsequent proceedings.”
Perhaps on some future occasion a bolder shareholder may
summon up courage to inquire what arrangements have been
made, so that an extraordinarily “great success" may “run” for
three, four, or five hundred nights and more? And suppose such a
hit were to happen in the absence of Sir HENRY, what would
the Lyceum Co., Limited, do with Sir HENRY 2. HENRY_or not
HaNRy, “that is the question.”. Is it Dividends first and Drama
afterwards? But, drama first by all means, only it must be a

holding her own against immense volume of sound emitted by pair

Co., Limited, Mr. CoMyNs CARR presented Sir HENRY’s “cordial
eetings” to the directors and shareholders, and the assurance that
#. (Sir HENRY) was perfectly satisfied and contented, and under
the circumstances, in a general way as happy as possible, which,
of course, was “tidings of comfort and joy.” Then an inquisitive
shareholder wanted to know what the future arrangements might
be, and the astute Mr. CARR declined to be drawn on that delicate
subject. Then, another shareholder politely requested to be in-
formed “whether the receipts had depreciated in the absence,
through illness, of Sir HENRY IRVING 2"
Now this would have been a bit of a poser for any managing
director, however well qualified for the post; but Mr. CARR, more
than equal to the occasion, astutely replied that “of course Sir
HENRY's absence would always depreciate receipts in any theatre
in which he appeared as leading actor”—and he might have illus-
trated his remark by asking where would be the great attraction
of a Lion Show in the absence of the Lion ? However, without
j for parables that might have been out of place at a
usiness meeting, he went on to reassure the shareholder, with
as little damage as possible to the feelings of Sir HENRY, that
“the attractions of the play were such that the results were in the
mass entirely satisfactory.” An oracular utterance so admirably
adapted to the occasion that no other shareholder seems to have
troubled the “subsequent proceedings.”
Perhaps on some future occasion a bolder shareholder may
summon up courage to inquire what arrangements have been
made, so that an extraordinarily “great success" may “run” for
three, four, or five hundred nights and more? And suppose such a
hit were to happen in the absence of Sir HENRY, what would
the Lyceum Co., Limited, do with Sir HENRY 2, HENRY_or not
HsnRy, “that is the question.”. Is it Dividends first and Drama
afterwards? But, drama first by all means, only it must be a

Thursday.—Since hapless King Louis
THE SIXTEENTH set out in the historic yellow
Berline, whose flight was stopped at
Warennes, there has been nothing quite so

the railway carriage DoN José did not
engage for flight to Lausanne. Nothing
more precise than the original statement.
The Berline—I mean the railway carriage,
was ordered by telephone, a means of com-
munication that would have greatly pleased
the boyish mind of the fugitive to Warennes.
There was some mistake about the moment
of departure. Here history, harking back to
the start of the Berline, repeats itself.
Finally, arrangements were concluded for
the carriage to be at the Gare de Lyons
to-morrow, at 9.10 P.M. (l'heure de Paris).
Don José, standing at the Table to-night
in view of the sacred volume upon which
members take the oath, solemnly declared
that the story was a fantasy. “I have
not,” he said, “engaged any railway car-
riage either in this country or in France. ... I
have no intention of leaving my country.”

House of Commons, Monday, June 12,
12 P.M.–"Well,” said the LoRD Advocate
* his pallid brow and smiling an arid
smile, “I have in my time opposed Home
Rule all round; after this I think I should
like it—especially for England and Ireland.”

measure reforming procedure on Scotch
private bills. With exception of CRIPPs,
the Picts left the room and the business
entirely to the Scots. For all practical
purposes a Scotch Parliament. CALDwell

“What I like,” he says, “is Committee.
When SPEAKER is in chair a member may
make only one speech on a particular ques-
tion. One motion one ". is all very
well for some people. oesn't suit me.
True, when I'm once on my legs I, like the
brook at Milton-on-Campsie, rainbow-hued
with proceeds of the paternal calico print-
ing business, run on for ever, or as near
that time as illimitable patience of House
will permit. As CAwmELL - BANNERMAN
once said, ‘Listening to you, my dear
CALDwell, I never know any reason why
you should sit down ; nor, indeed,” he
added after a moment's reflection, ‘why
}. should have got up.’ Don't know what
e means by last remark. Fancy it must
be by way of a joke, for CAwMELL's aye
humoursome. The first part is quite true,
and nicely said. When I do sit down after
speaking for an hour or so I haven't been
on the bench two minutes when bang goes
another idea. Something I might have
talked about for a glad half hour. Rules of
House against it. In Committee no such
restriction. . As GRAHAM, MURRAY says,
‘Scotch debate in Committee is a sort of

How stands the case of JossPH. C.?
Is every Fº when we prepare it,
Serenely just, profoundly right?
Is black as black as men declare it,
Or just a darker shade of white?
The Uitlander would fain renounce us;
He pines to be a Transvaal Boer.
Shall Uncle KRüger always bounce us
By closing every open door?
Our remedy for wrongs so grievous
Is just to make Oom PAUL allow
These British citizens to leave us,
And help to milk the Transvaal cow,

Is Josh PH's fame securely founded,
Or merely made of gaudy shams ?
What were the secrets he propounded
In those mysterious telegrams?
These questions much perplex the nation;
Our minds adopt the changing hue
Of every daily alteration
Of policies and points of view.
For first our papers shout for battle;
Then, presto, all the shoutings cease,
And with a lightning change we rattle
From blood to i. from war to peace!
The wine of threats is thinned with water;
Furled are the flags and hushed the

Next day our peacefulness we smother;

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday.—The Don. M. RENAUD, who had been “called on ”
twice after second act, and had politely returned the call, now sent
round to his “friends in front” to say that he was suffering from
hoarseness. The information was necessary, as otherwise the fact
would have passed unnoticed by the audience. ZELIs Zerlina
sprightly arch as usual, LILLI LEHMANN majestic, and Black-Ey'd
SUZANNE ADAMs a rather knowing Donna Elvira.
Tuesday Night.—In view of coming Henley Week, and of
Regatta season generally having now set in, the Operatic manage-
ment, ever ready to get along swimmingly with the tide of popular
favour, evidently considered it a Happy Thought to produce Ero
e Leandro, by that “Jolly young Water-MAN"-CINELLſ. That the
announcement must have taken the public by surprise was evident
from the thinness of the house, which was in a reduced state, per-
haps on account of the afternoon's heat, with rain threatening and
thunderstorms in the air. Louise HomeR, as Prologo, came like
a shadow and so departed, being with us but for a few brief
moments. Mlle. STRAkosch, as Ero the "Eroine, and M. SALĀzA
as the Hero, the classic professor of natation, and PLANgoN as
the classie Irishman, Arry O'Farnie—spelt in Italian Airofarne—
did their level best, and the best on this occasion was so uncom-
monly level that the entire Opera, musically and dramatically,
seemed rather flat. Signor MANCINELLI conducted, but whether
during the performance he was pleased or grieved, it was impossible
to determine from the audience's point of view of him.
Wednesday-An emotional House calling JEAN DE REszKE on
before the curtain some eight or ten times in order to bid him
heartily farewell. Rather trying for our stout JEAN. However,
though he played and sang Tristan to perfection, he was not so
overcome at the prospect of parting from his dear friends, “as,”
observed gaily Mr. WAggsTAFF, “to appear a very Triste'un.”
Hope WAGGIE will be locked up before next season. He sees the
name of JACQUES BARs in the programme and, of course, wants to
know “which Bars? Is it drinking Bars, Chancery and Common
Law Bars, musical Bars, American Brown Bars, or—” But at
this point (if the word “point” can possibly be applied to anything
WAGGSTAFF ever utters) we fled. Suffice it that #. two Reszkes,
BISPHAM, PRINGLE, and BARs, with Mme. LILLI LEHMANN, as
Isolde, and Mlle. OLITZRA as Brangane, were all first-rate.
Thursday.—Tannhäuser. An “off” night, i.e. WAN Dyck and
Mons. PLANgoN, both being “indispoged,” were “off it.” Their
efficient substitutes were Herr DIPPEL and Mister PRINGLE.
Elisabeth was well sung and played by Mme. GADsk1; Venus came
out strong, or rather, Miss Susan STRoNg was all her name implies
as Venus. In spite of its being, comparatively, a “Poor House,”
there was plenty of money in it, judging from appearances.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE late Mr. GEORGE W. FISHER's handsome book of the
Annals of Shrewsbury School º should be a joy to all Old
Salopians, as it is to one of them, my Nautical Retainer, who here
writes its F. There were school customs on which he could
have enlightened the author, but the work does not pretend to
exhaust the extensive and peculiar details of the habits of the boys
as they lived; rather to be an historical reeord of the school from
the time when it rose to fame under Essex's friend Ashton,
#. of Whitsuntide Plays, and counted PHILIP SIDNEY and
ULKE GREVILLE among its alumni, till, after many vicissitudes,
it won, and held during at least the middle half of the present
century, the first place easily among English public schools for
ure classical scholarship. At the same time, though Mr. FISHER,
imself formerly a Shrewsbury Master, has dwelt most upon the
history of the school as a seat of learning, the lighter side of
things is not neglected; the prowess of the school by flood and
field is traced back from the honours of her latest blues to the
time when, in the days of good Queen Bess, “the only games
permitted at the school were “shootinge in the longe bowe,’
chesse plaie,' running, wrestling, and leaping; ” when, with the
exception of “limited stakes, 1d, a game § 4d. a match,” all
betting, “openlie or covertlie,” was forbidden ; and offenders
“severely punyshed ” or else “expulsed for ever.” A useful
ordinance of the same period made provision for the case of
masters who might be unable to perform their duties satisfactorily
by reason of “greate age or imbecilitie.”
Both Great and Small, by ARTHUR LEggs (John LANE), should
undoubtedly have been issued as the opening number of a series,
say, Lane's Penny Fireside Novelette, in which form its lurid
banalities could have made a more successful appeal. We have
the noble Earl ºr. by the poor clergyman's daughter, until
the time-honoured device of an affray in which he gets seriously
mangled brings her rushing to his side, and, like the noble girl
she is, promising to sacrifice herself and marry into the peerage.
We have the bad and beauteous lady who calls a spade—emphati-
cally and at frequent intervals—a spade; we have the gallant
captain on whom she casts her basilisk eyes, making him so un-
comfortable that he marries her, and spends the rest of his life
being misunderstood by every one; and we have the death of the
harmless, necessary child that instantaneously changes his bad and
beauteous wife into a good but plain one. And when he finds her
at last, after years of separation, on a lonely beach, a considerate
tide surrounds them with boiling surf, and nothing remains but the
“still pitiless cliffs, and the leaping, staggering, drunken sea.”
“If only we could believe that 7” sighs the Baron's Retainer,
ordinarily “blithe and gay,” “but we know, alas, that neither b
plague nor pestilence, fire nor water, can this kind of people be kille
outright, never to re-appear in any novel or romance whatever.”
Florizel's Holly (CHATTo AND WINDUs) is the gentle way of jº.
things Mr. John Ashton adopts as the title of a work devote
to record of the social life of the Prince of WALEs, afterwards
GEORGE THE FourTH. If he had called it Florizel's Meanness,
Gluttony, Debauchery, and Absolute Worthlessness, it would have
been a more cumbrous but a more accurate label for the volume.
My Baronite is amazed to think that such goings on as are here
described happened in the highest places of this realm not more
than a hundred years ago. What makes the record the more
terrible is the compiler's severe abstention from comment. He is
as unemotionable as a telephone or a phonograph. His not to
wonder why. He collects with intelligent assiduity from a far-
stretching field contemporary records of the doings of “the First
Gentleman of Europe,” chiefly in connection with his orgies at
Brighton. The only gleam of satisfaction that lights on the
sordid story is found in the wholesome freedom of comment by pen
and pencil displayed by the newspapers and the GILRAYs of the
dav. #. in what low saturnalia the Prince got into
debt. All the same, when time after time his wretched father
appealed to Parliament to pay off his pimps and harlots the
money was forthcoming. HE BARON DE B.-W.

gaze sadly upon the sleeper and thereafter
speak these lines, sternly :—
LoNDoN, awake! I notice with regret
That Art and You are unacquainted yet,
Your homes are ugly and your streets are
irty
You've not *śvanced a step since 1880.
You love the gorgeous and eschew the chaste

Then shall he descend the steps of the stage

shall enter, on the Right, in poor attire, a
fair youth, which is ARCHITECTURE, who

A mansion fit for thee,
Which other members of the Guild
Shall furnish fittingly;
A house as large, a house as fine,
A house as fair and free,
As anywhere shall meet thine ey'ne,
That house I'll build for thee.

again, harmlessly this time, at least, hurt-

Then, momentarily displacing the house-

the image of an Artistic Party in Parliament,
led by Lord WEMYss, with STANLEY of
Alderley as Whip, prescribing for the Royal
Academy rules of conduct and procedure.
“I hope,” said the MARKIss, “they will
organise themselves in some such way that
their recommendations shall have a ten-
dency towards unanimity.” Next he be-
thought him, that since he came into office,
he and his colleagues, more especially those
seated in the Commons, have passed much
time in appointing Royal Commissions and
Select Committees. Whenever a quandary

MoUTH rose from Front Opposition Bench
to state his views on the bill. For a quarter
of an hour set them forth with lucidity and
force that indicated loss sustained by Com-
mons through years when office of Whip
tied his tongue.
“Now, my lords,” he continued, “I
come to the question of the powers con-
ferred on these bodies.”. Here he stopped;
turned over copy of bill spread on table
before him ; long pause, while he studied
contents. “My lords, I now come—.”
Another silence ; turned over the bill
with hastier movement. Prolonged pause.
Noble lords sat silent, struggling against
tendency to show signs of anxiety. The
Dook, waking up from refreshing sleep
following on his historical review of Govern-

It seemed fully a quarter of an hour.
“My lords,” said the voice at the table
for the fourth time, “I now come to the
powers conferred upon these bodies.”. That

went on in level voice, undisturbed manner,
just as if nothing in the world had happened.
“My dear ToBy,” a peer who has achieved
perfect command over the Lords as an
audience once said, “when I get up in the
House I feel as if I were addressing an
assembly of tombstones.”

perience can fully appreciate the measure of

Business dome.—London Government Bill
read a second time.
Friday.-SARK tells me that when on
Monday London_Government Bill is taken
in Committee, JAMEs of HEREFORD (not
the Bishop but the Beau) will move an
amendment providing that no woman under
forty shall be eligible for election as an
aulderwoman in the new Metropolitan
municipalities.
That seems designed to fatally limit field
of selection. So few women, especially of
the unmarried class who take an interest in
public affairs, have reached the age of forty.
SARK says it's all right; Lord JAMEs would
not, on any account, attempt to damage the
bill at this particular point. What he
really wants is to strengthen it. An in-
timate study of the subject has brought him
A REAL NATIVE,

When champagne is kept in stock past a
certain age it is apt to be ullaged. "That

know, it adds to the quality of the wine.
Unmarried women over forty are, from the
matrimonial-market point of view, regarded
as ullaged. Actually they are improved in
quality and value. The effervescence of
youth has left behind more stable qualities.
Hence, if the new institution of aulder-

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
To SIR ALFRED MILNER.
SIR,--You are a High Commissioner. While most of us potter
along the dull path of our daily lives, you are of the select few who
guide the P. of governments, pen despatches, call at need for
armies and navies to support their pronouncements, and, in a
word, represent the majesty of Great Britain in distant lands.
It seems but yesterday that you set out for South Africa, that
grave of so many reputations, which Providence and Mr. Joseph
CHAMBERLAIN had selected as a field for your ambitions and
energies. With how loud a chorus of praise and encouragement
did you go forth. ... You were a Balliol man; you had lived your
allotted undergraduate span in the mild and magnificent eye of
BENJAMIN Jowett ; you had been Mr. GoschEN's private secre-
tary; you had been a journalist; you had directed your imperial
steps to Egypt, had helped to govern the meek fellah and had
written a book on your experiences; you had friends, a host of
them, who wished you well, and not a single enemy. And thus,
as the ship bore you from our shores, we realised with a sigh of
relief that at last the haughty, KRüger, the malleus Josephi, was
about to meet his match, and that through you, your suavity, your
firmness, your temperate demeanour and your energetic action,
the stiff-necked Boer of the Transvaal would be brought to recog:
nise his true place in the divine order of things, and to submit to
the hand of manifest Destiny as guided and strengthened b
CHAMBERLAIN, your eye-glassed Chieftain. The situation in Sout
Africa was difficult. Rarely in that land of difficulties has there
been a situation demanding so much tact and patience, such gentle
and kindly, humouring to soothe wounds still raw, such wary
walking to find a safe way between financial rogueries and Jingo
excess on the one side an obstinacy, suspicion, and resentment on
the other. But it is in difficult situations that the master-mind
displays itself; when to the commonplace man the puzzle appears
impossible of solution, lo, the heaven-born genius arrives and
and such a heaven-born genius, it appeared, we had secured in
you, and therefore you went, heavily-freighted with our confidence
and our praise, to be High Commissioner at Cape Town.
For a long time we heard little or nothing of you. To be sure
matters did not seem to be tºº in the Transvaal. The
Uitlander still clamoured for what he called his rights, still he
roclaimed to all the listening world that he could not possibly be
appy until he got the franchise, and still Mr. KRüger and the
i. refused to provide this rich and interesting alien with his
favourite plaything... “Give ALFRED MILNER time,” said your
supporters, “wait till he's firmly seated in the saddle, and then
you’ll see what will happen to KRUGRR.” Well, we waited;
there wasn't much else for us to do; and still, as time went
on, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN uttered dark sayings, and most of the
ãº. declared that if we failed to do our duty promptly in
the Transvaal, we might just as well resign ourselves to the
mockery and contempt of civilised nations. Then suddenly the
crisis became acute, the Uitlander clamoured with an even louder
voice, the Boer became more and more suspicious and determined,
the franchise receded into a dimmer distance, there were rumours
of Army-Corps and Squadrons, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN still uttered
dark sayings, and then one blessed morning we woke to the
knowledge that everything was about to be settled in our favour,
since a Conference had been arranged between you and Mr.
KRüger.
The Conference took place, and, I shudder as I write the dreadful
words, back to Pretoria went President KRüGER with all the
honours, while you, Sir, returned to Cape Town, having accom-
plished nothing.
And then your despatch, that impassioned despatch, which was
sent º: the telegraph wires, was published, and in a
moment, as if by magic, things that had been bad became worse,
the whole tribe of Jingoes began to wave flags and shout for blood,
and calm and sober Englishmen who had trusted you and placed
their hopes of a settlement in your abilities and exertions, were
struck with shame.
Do not misunderstand me. No one was disposed to blame you
for the failure of the Conference. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN is a hard
taskmaster, Mr. KRUGER is a hard and cautious bargainer. To
reconcile the instructions you had received and the opposition you
encountered might well, we .# have been an undertaking
too difficult for a merely mortal High Commissioner. But, alas
for that melancholy, that untimely effort of cabled rhetoric, your
despatch. How shall we henceforth, with these rash, these
passionate, these ill-omened words before our eyes, put confidence
in your calmness, your tact, or your judgment? I lay no stress on
an occasional defect of grammar, for the wires often make havoc of
grammar, and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN may not have been in a humour
to correct; but the tone of the whole thing, the temper it shows,
its tawdry rhetorical pleadings, its appeal to º: and spread-
eagleism, its ill-judged reflections on the loyalty of our Dutch
fellow subjects—these qualities so crudely displayed cannot but
destroy your reputation and your authority amongst those over
whom you are set. That passage about “thousands of British
subjects kept permanently in the position of helots” would, of
i. be sufficient to impair the career of an even greater man.
How ridiculous, how preposterously frothy it sounds. Many of us
have met, I suppose, some such South African helot; he was
prosperous, well-fed, and portly; a heavy chain of gold, the badge
not of his servitude, but of his wealth, stretched, across his ample
waistcoat; jewels sparkled in his tie-pin; his clothes were of a rich
and massive decency; his boots creaked of balances at banks and
manifold investments. Such a man may be many things, but a
helot he is not.
Why, oh why, could you not sleep on this literary effort and
then fear it up and write another? Was your ardour so great,
was the necessity so sharp that you must needs rush hot-foot to a
telegraph office and worry the wires with these foolish helotries 2
I cannot believe it. And, if your usefulness is gone, if the Boers
denounce you, if the Afrikander Bond regards you with distrust
and a bitter resentment, have you any one to blame for this un-
happy result except your rash, impetuous, and overbearing self?
I am, Sir, yours sorrowfully, THE WAGRANT.

enough.

waistcoat; jewels sparkled in his tie-pin; his clothes were of a rich

manifold investments. Such a man may be many things, but a
helot he is not.

LETTERS TO THE CELEBRATED.
To SIR ALFRED MILNER.
SIR,--You are a High Commissioner. While most of us potter
along the dull path of our daily lives, you are of the select few who
guide the Pºiº of governments, pen despatches, call at need for
armies and navies to support their pronouncements, and, in a
word, represent the º: Great Britain in distant lands.
It seems but yesterday that you set out for South Africa, that
ave of so many reputations, which Providence and Mr. Joseph
HAMBERLAIN had selected as a field for your ambitions and
energies. With how loud a chorus of praise and encouragement
did you go forth. . You were a Balliol man; you had lived your
allotted undergraduate span in the mild and magnificent eye of
BENJAMIN Joy ETT; you had been Mr. GoschEN's private secre-
tary; you had been a journalist; you had directed your imperial
steps to Egypt, had helped to govern the meek fellah and had
written a book on your experiences; you had friends, a host of
them, who wished you well, and not a single enemy. And thus,
as the ship bore you from our shores, we realised with a sigh of
relief that at last the haughty KRUGER, the malleus Josephi, was
about to meet his match, and that through you, your suavity, your
firmness, your temperate demeanour and your energetic action,
the stiff-necked Boer of the Transvaal would be brought to recog.
mise his true place in the divine order of things, and to submit to
the hand of manifest Destiny as guided and strengthened b
CHAMBERLAIN, your eye-glassed Chieftain. The situation in Sout
Africa was difficult. Rarely in that land of difficulties has there
been a situation demanding so much tact and patience, such gentle
and kindly, humouring to soothe wounds still raw, such wary
walking to find a safe way between financial rogueries and Jingo
excess on the one side an obstinacy, suspicion, and resentment on
the other. But it is in difficult situations that the master-mind
displays itself; when to the commonplace man the puzzle appears
impossible of solution, lo, the heaven-born genius arrives and
and such a heaven-born genius, it appeared, we had secured in
you, and therefore you went, heavily-freighted with our confidence
and our praise, to be High Commissioner at Cape Town.
For a long time we heard little or nothing of you. To be sure
matters did not seem to be º in the Transvaal. The
Uitlander still clamoured for what he called his rights, still he
º to all the listening world that he could not possibly be
appy until he got the franchise, and still Mr. KRüger and the
R refused to provide this rich and interesting alien with his
favourite plaything... “Give ALFRED, MILNER time,” said your
supporters, “wait till he's firmly seated in the saddle, and then
you'll see what will happen to KRüGER.” Well, we waited;
there wasn't much else for us to do; and still, as time went
on, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN uttered dark sayings, and most of the
newspapers declared that if we failed to do our duty promptly in
the Transvaal, we might just, as well resign, ourselves to the
mockery and contempt of civilised nations. Then suddenly the
crisis became acute, the Uitlander clamoured with an even louder
voice, the Boer became more and more suspicious and determined,
the franchise receded into a dimmer distance, there were rumours
of Army-Corps and Squadrons, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN still uttered
dark sayings, and then one blessed morning we woke to the
knowledge that everything was about to be settled in our favour,
since a Conference had been arranged between you and Mr.
KRüger.
The Conference took place, and, I shudder as I write the dreadful
words, back to Pretoria went President KRüger with all the
honours, while you, Sir, returned to Cape Town, having accom-
plished nothing.
And then your despatch, that impassioned despatch, which was
sent palpitating along the telegraph wires, was published, and in a
moment, as if §: magic, things that had been bad became worse,
the whole tribe of Jingoes began to wave flags and shout for blood,
and calm and sober Englishmen who had trusted you and placed
their hopes of a settlement in your abilities and exertions, were
struck with shame.
Do not misunderstand me. No one was disposed to blame you
for the failure of the Conference. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN is a hard
taskmaster, Mr. KRUGER is a hard and cautious bargainer. To
reconcile the instructions you had received and the opposition you
encountered might well, we .# have been an undertaking
too difficult for a merely mortal High Commissioner. But, alas
for that melancholy, that untimely effort of cabled rhetoric, your
despatch. How shall we henceforth, with these rash, these
passionate, these ill-omened words before our eyes, put confidence
in your calmness, your tact, or your judgment? I lay no stress on
an occasional defect of grammar, for the wires often make havoc of
grammar, and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN may not have been in a humour
to correct; but the tone of the whole thing, the temper it shows,
its tawdry rhetorical pleadings, its appeal to prejudice and spread-
eagleism, its ill-judged reflections on the loyalty of our Dutch
fellow subjects—these qualities so crudely displayed cannot but
destroy your reputation and your authority amongst those over
whom you are set. That passage about “thousands of British
subjects kept permanently in the position of helots” would, of
itself, be sufficient to impair the career of an even greater man.
How ridiculous, how preposterously frothy it sounds. Many of us
have met, I suppose, some such South African helot; he was
prosperous, well-fed, and portly; a heavy chain of gold, the badge
not of his servitude, but of his wealth, stretched, across his ample
waistcoat; jewels sparkled in his tie-pin; his clothes were of a rich
and massive decency; his boots creaked of balances at banks and
manifold investments. Such a man may be many things, but a
helot he is not.
Why, oh why, could you not sleep on this literary effort and
then fear it up and write another? Was your ardour so great,
was the necessity so sharp that you must needs rush hot-foot to a
telegraph office and worry the wires with these foolish helotries 2
I cannot believe it. And, if your usefulness is gone, if the Boers
denounce you, if the Afrikander Bond regards you with distrust
and a bitter resentment, have you any one to blame for this un-
happy result except your rash, impetuous, and overbearing self?
I am, Sir, yours sorrowfully, THE WAGRANT.

First Cyclist (cross-eyed). “WHY THE Dickens Don't You Look where You 'RE GoING !”
Second Cyclist (cross-eyed). “WHY DoN'T You go where You 'BE LookING!"
A GENUINE CEIEWALIER D'INDUSTRIE.
Mowrkz, montez, Mesdames et Messieurs, montez the stairs of
Queen's Hall, Langham Place, next door to the Hall of St. George
(where the highly-trained performing “Gee Gee,” or GEoRGE
GRossMITH, continues to delight the public), and at an elevation in
the building quite in keeping with the high-toned character of the
entertainment, you will both see and hear, and, what is more,
thoroughly enjoy the most artistically dramatic masterpieces of
Mr. ALBERT CHEvaLIER. Among these, his impersonation of old
Gaffer who has been “mindin’ the pigs this forty year,” and who
knowingly defies his son from London to “take a rise” out of
him, is in every way admirable. This must be coupled with his
now well known pathetic song “My Old Dutch,” which makes
those who came only to laugh, remain to feel a choking sensation
in the throat, and furtively imitate the action of the soldier who,
leaning on his sword, “wiped away a tear.” Scarcely has the
audience stifled its sob than they are moved to convulsive laughter
by Mr. CHEvaLIER's reap ce with the song of “Blue Ribbon
Jane,” and after another interval of rest he entertains them with a
sketch of a broken-down professional actor, who, having in his
time played all parts from Hamlet to Clown, is now out of work
and struggling for a livelihood. It is a Cruikshankian illustration
to a character that DICKENs might have sketched. Then his
typical Frenchman of the café chantant with light-hearted song
and indiotick-tock-tra-la-la refrain to a très chic chanson, all “go”
and no sense. In Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER's programme there is
no such word as “fail,” everything being successful in its degree.
Mr. CHEvaLIER is assisted by a clever trio of vocalists, Miss CARR
SHAw, Mr. HARRY BRETT, and Mr. FRANK PEMBERTox, and by
way of contrast to all the singing and speaking comes the delicate
conjuring of Mr. Chris Hilton, “The Magic Mute,” whose sleight
of hand is excellent.
Mr. ALBERT CHEvaLIER, who is always hard at work in town or
country, certainly deserves the title of “Le Chevalier d’Industrie”
in the very best sense of an honest translation.
