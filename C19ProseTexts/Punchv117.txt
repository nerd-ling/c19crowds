TT was a fine open day, and the artificial ice bore patiently. The Old Century was sticking to the figure 8 with the
1 pathetic energy of despair. There was every prospect of an exceptionally New Year.
Meanwhile the Evergreen Sage gave the finishing touches to his travelling toga. Nine and fifty winters
bad furrowed his brow, but his paunch was not thinned nor his natural hump abated. Yet, whether or not he had
been drinking too freely of the Spirit of the Age, he had of late been conscious of what the doctor diagnosed as a
Weltschmery in the region of the waistcoat. He was therefore about to take a change of air, being recommended to
give a trial to the old-established Delphi treatment.
Sallying forth, he tapped the Mercurius that stood, foursquare, before his pious portal.
“ Jolly fighting weather over there, I hope," said the Old Horatian, as his thoughts turned to the Absent-minded
Beggar (Venator tenerce conjugis immemor), under a sweltering sky, doing his best to bag the martial Boer
(Marsus aper).
A brief delay, owing to the strain of mobilisation, and the Sage was at sea in a small transport of delight. Twice
he had to put back for repairs, but by the eve of the New Year he had landed, pushed up-country, and presented him-
self at the gates of the Temple of Phæbus Apollo. The well-preserved proprietor answered the door.
“I will trouble you, my Lord, for an Elixir of Youth,” began the Sage.
“In this establishment,” replied the god, “it is usual to open with a conundrum.”
“Then, perhaps," said Mr. PUNCH (for it was he), "you will answer the following :—When is a New Century
not a New Century ?”
After a long pause, the Far-darter spoke. “I should prefer to put it to the priestess," he said.
“ You give it up?" said the Sage. “And I do not blame you. A very wide ignorance prevails on this question.
There is a consensus of opinion on one point only,—that a New Century cannot properly begin before the Old one is
finished. Now you will follow me when I argue that the various Centuries ought to start contemporaneously with the
commencement of the year 1, 101, 201, and so forth. Therefore a New Century is not a New Century when it tries to
begin at the year 0, 100, 200, and so— ” Here the Sage's flow of thought was arrested by sounds of incipient
intoxication issuing from an inner chamber.
"It is my Pythian palmist,” said the Sun-god ; "she has just taken her dose of chopped laurel, and become
enthusiastic. I will consult her presently upon the matter under discussion; and the correct solution shall be forwarded

to you as soon as it has been reduced to hexameters. Meanwhile let me revert to your original request. You asked, I
think, after an Elixir of Youth? But I see no signs of wear in your admirable physique.”
“Possibly,” replied the Veteran, with a becoming blush. “Age, it is true, has not withered me, nor custom
staled my infinite variety. Still it is an era of New Departures, and I am bound to conduct the motor- Van. There
fore I come in quest of some balsam of Automobility.”
“Have you sampled our 1900 Rejuvenator ?” asked the immortal leech.
“Not consciously,” replied the patient.
“Then come with me,” said the medicine-god. “ No, leave the dog behind,” he added, as he led the way through
a chamber heavily hung with fumes of brimstone and bay-rhum. “Mind the off-leg of the Tripod,” cried the gay Lord
Phæbus. So they debouched into the dispensary.
“These powders,” said the Python-slayer, “should settle matters while you wait. Permit me to give you a
couple.”
The effect was instantaneous. Though not swelling visibly to the outward eye, the Sage was cognisant of a
pleasing fertilisation of his marrow, and an added suppleness in his elbow-joints. His hand involuntarily wandered to
the scalp of his head, where the smooth superficies seemed to burgeon out into blossoming leaves.
“That 's all right,” said the young patron of the Bays ; "those laurel feuilletons give quite a tone to your
adorable summit.”
“And the honorarium ?” said the Sage, as he emerged from the shrine.
“My services are given gratis,” replied the Curer of All, “ though I understand that it is customary to tip the
attendant priest. The present circumstances, however, are rare and peculiar. I will therefore ask you to present me
with a memento of the Old Order of Things in the shape of that treasure which you have entrusted to the care of your
faithful hound, Tobias. I refer, in brief, to your

All the charitable geese, as'is but just;
From the schoolgirl with her sash on, to the height of rank and

I work on their compassion with the aid of the Trust.
For example, I will beg with a bogus wooden leg,

Or if there is a slump in wooden legs, I stump
With a dromedary's hump, which is lent by the Trust.
Or if people will not spend on a hunch-back, then I send
For a little card, “ Kind friend, give the blind man a crust,"
Or I tramp this modern Babel as a mute: I'm always able
To secure a change of label with the aid of the Trust.'

When I'm old and laid aside, and beginning to rust,
For it's worthy the attention of some folk that I could mention,
That I draw an Old Age Pension with the aid of the Trust.

the mining world as “shifts,” is obviously not available for us
all. Mr. H. L. STEPHEN recognising this fact, has met the
difficulty by a compilation from the monumental work, a sort of
skimming of the cream off the spacious milk-pan. The result is
a fascinating work issued by Messrs. DUCKWORTH in two handy
volumes. Mr. STEPHEN modestly excuses himself for not dealing
with some famous cases because WALTER SCOTT and STEVENSON

Waverley and Katriona. What is left is, in human interest,

Till the force of my fond declarations
Endangered the birch-bark canoe.
The rest of our doings are folded
In secrecy silent as Fate,
But I know we were thoroughly scolded
For keeping the dinner so late.
And as for the blessed Regatta,
Not the prick of a pin did I care,
For oh! what the deuce did it matter
When MAISIE, my MAISIE, was there?

OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENCE.
NOVICE.—(a.) Don't, unless you want penal
servitude for life. (6.) Any respectable
burglar. (c.) We do not answer ques-
tions on chiropody in this column.
HARD UP.-Brougham on Conveyances will
explain whether your contract to pur-
chase the motor-car is binding or not.
FARMER.-It is either an“ escrow" or a
scarescrow, impossible to state definitely
without further information.
B. AND $.—There is no reduction (of the
fine) in taking a quantity-generally the
reverse.
THE POINT OF VIEW.-II.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - Will you let me
sound a note of warning ? The danger
before this country-as Lord WEMYSS has
pointed out — is SOCIALISM! i.e., Inter-
ference with the liberty of the subject.
Now, Sir, I am a plain working-man, and
all I want is to be let alone, to get on with
my work. But what do we find ? Silly
rules and regulations and sillier policemen
everywhere. Why, Sir, you and I run the
danger, any night, of being copped-I beg
pardon — arrested, for some trumpery
offence. And what is a man offered in
return? The “First Offenders Act," for-
sooth! As if that would be of any use to
you, Mr. Punch, or to me! As an honest
citizen I am glad to pay my share for the
police, but let them keep to their proper
sphere-the area-and allow busy men like
you and me to go our ways in “Peace.”
Unless I have some guarantee that these

I VAGUELY remember a vision
Of launches and paddles and oars,
Of various boats in collision,
And various lightly clad “ fours";
Of damsels in summery dresses,
Some pretty, some possibly plain,
And oh ! my fond wish, I confess, is
To have it all over again !
And I still see a sweet little lady
In the bows of a birch-bark canoe.
A flutter of ribbons and laces,
The gleam of a glossy brown curl,
And the sweetest of sweet pretty faces,
The face of my own little girl..
I remember a struggle for places
As soon as the luncheon was done,
And I rather believe there were races
Which probably somebody won.
But that is all hopelessly hazy,
For what in the world did I care
When MAISIE, adorable MAISIE,
My own little MAISIE was there?
We paddled by silvery willows,
We moored ourselves under a tree,
While the dear little miniature billows
Made music for MAISIE and me.
We talked of the joys of the river,
We voted the races a bore,
And we warmly agreed that we never
Had really enjoyed them before.

drama, the pathological and the merely
melodramatic. The pathological has more
merit from the strictly dramatic stand-
point, but melodrama runs longer.'
If you decide for melodrama immense
possibilities are open to you. You can
have your hero besieged in a gorgeous
temple, and let him quell a mutiny with a
glance of his eye and a single revolver
cartridge. He can carry on his flirtation
with somebody else's wife in the intervals
of 'the fray, and lead a picturesque ex-
istence amid punkahs and profanity.
If, on the other hand, pathology is your
game, you will have to get up the details
of obscure mental maladies, and take a
hint or two from Norway. Your medical
knowledge should be extensive and minute,
and some acquaintance with methods of
disseminating cholera and other zymotic
diseases, and with the principles of opera-
tive surgery and of general therapeutics,
is essential.
On the whole, I am inclined to think
that a judicious blend of the pathological
and the melodramatic is your best game.
You might call your play Corker Sahib,
and construct it more or less as follows:-
In Act I., Colonel Corker and Miss
Corker, M.D., his daughter, will be dis-
covered in a bungalow at Fudgepore,
playing with a case of surgical instru-
ments. The Colonel will tell Mrs. Monsoon
(the somebody else's wife of the cast) of
his adventures in frontier warfare. It
will be a somewhat “tall ” story, in which
Corker will narrate with pride how he
murdered several inconvenient people, and
put down a frontier rising by various
unprofessional means. Miss Corker will
preserve a discreet but smiling silence,
and toy with an ophthalmoscope.
In Act II., Corker Sahib will be dis-
covered in the Taj Mahal, being besieged
by an infuriated enemy. A continuous
roll of musketry will be heard without,
but the intrepid Corker will be quite
unmoved, and will devote his whole time
to prosecuting his flirtation with Mrs.
Monsoon and squabbling with the senior
major, who also finds it convenient to be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Ma Mère (SMITH, ELDER) is a terrible household fiend, who, the
Vicomte JEAN DE LUZ hints, is not entirely evolved out of his gift
of romance. The story purports to describe the life and experi-
ence of sons and daughters under the Second Empire. It is a
very miserable state of things in which on the man's part the dot
is, in matrimony, the chief thing. As for the girl, she often goes
straight from the Convent to the arms of a man whom she has
scarcely seen before she stands by his side at the altar. Indulg-
ing in the luxury of added gloom, our cheerful Vicomte lays the
scene of his domestic drama in the Court of the Second Empire,
at the time it was dropping like a rotten pear. If the state of
things at the Tuileries and Compiègne were half as bad as they
are painted in these pages (and the narrative bears the graphic
inipress of actuality), all my Baronite can say is, that France,
under the Empire, was nearly as badly off as she has been under
a succession of republican governments, culminating in one that
will, through all the ages, be marked with the infamy of the
plot against DREYFUS. One gleam of brightness in the sordid
story is shed by the presence of the heroine, Yvonne de Gérando.
In a handsome volume, boldly printed on good paper, repro-
ducing all the illustrations and maps of the first edition, Messrs.
NEWNES turn out for 78. 6d. Vol. I. of H. M. STANLEY'S Through
the Dark Continent. It is the record of his successful endeavour
to complete the work left unfinished at the death of Dr. LIVING-
STONE. The work, as my Baronite remarks, is familiar to the
English-speaking race. What is novel about it is its new dress
-a cheap cotton print, so to speak—and the Preface Sir HENRY
contributes, reviewing the amazing changes that have taken place
in the regions described in type more than twenty years ago.
The worst of going to the theatre is the disaster it brings on ço Anoop
dinner. Even at the comparatively late hour at which plays now
commence in London theatres, one must dine at an abnormal hour
to be in his place when the curtain rises. To any one in search
of the amusement of a good comedy, combined with the comfort of
accustomed dinner, my Baronite recommends The Lunatic at
Large (BLACKWOOD), by J. STORER CLOUSTON. It presents a suc-
cession of really comic scenes, arising in the most natural manner,
pourtrayed with graphic touches that recall the movement, light,
and colour of the stage. The play 's the thing, and here it is.

SER
AN EVERY NIGHT “REVUE.”'
Pot-Pourri at the Avenue Theatre, written by (for a wonder)
only one author, Mr. JAMES T. TANNER, with lyrics" by only
one librettist, W. H. RISQUE, and set to music by a single unaided
composer, NAPOLEON LAMBELET (a name highly suggestive of a
most successful Anglo-French harmonious alliance as indicating
the partnership of a sleeping lion and a playful lambkin),
professes to be only “ A Revue of 1899," though it deals with
some subjects that date back to '97. It is illustrated by several
very clever actors and actresses, adepts at “ quick change"
from one disguise to another, not always perhaps with such
complete success as to defy recognition of identity. While
some of the actors make only the faintest attempt at facially
resembling the public characters whom they are supposed to be
personating, yet in most instances they have caught "the tricks
and the manners” peculiar to the persons imitated. Thus, not
facially, but by mannerisms in tone and tricky movements, Mr.
FARREN SOUTAR's imitations of CHARLES HAWTREY, HAYDEN
COFFIN, CHARLES WYNDHAM, are immediately recognised, while
his “ make-up" as Mr. PINERO is perfect. Mr. JOHN LE HAY,
ventriloquist and entertainer, is very amusing, though in his
imitation of Mr. HARE as the Gay Lord Quex there is little
that recalls that comedian, except one or two well-known
mannerisms. The ladies, however, fairly carry off the honours,
for Mlle. JANE MAY, singing as YVETTE GUILBERT, and acting as
SARA BERNHARDT in Hamlet, is admirable; shutiyour eyes and
you are listening to SARA herself; open them and you see a
near relation of SARA's. Miss MARIE DAINTON'S imitations of
Miss WINIFRED EMERY and MARIE TEMPEST are excellent; while
her IRENE VANBRUGH as the Manicurist in the great scene at
the Globe is very nearly an exact reproduction of the clever
original. The somewhat unequal and jerky entertainment owes
much of its “go” to the really admirable performance of Miss
CLAIRE ROMAINE as Miss MAUDE MILLET in the Tyranny of Tears,
as Biggs from The Circus Girl, as La Duchesse Fortescue (in the
Quextionable scene at the Globe), as La Poupée, but above all as
“Mary, a Housemaid,” in which character she sings a song
which is the hit of the entire evening, compelling any number of
encores with which Miss CLAIRE ROMAINE complies, going one
verse better every time. This “ Variety show" piece (of which
the second act is far and away the brighter) mainly appeals to
habitués of the theatres and halls, and a great deal of it is

NEW WORDS FOR AN OLD TUNE.
“I AM in a strait, ISAAC GORDON,
I am in a strait, a strait financially.
I have sought help at the Bank, ISAAC GORDON,
And in the humble shop where the Golden Balls hang three."
“Sixty per cent.,” said ISAAC GORDON,
“Is all I ask on good security.”
The security was sound,
So he lent him fifty pound,
And the borrower the money took, and rejoicing home went he.
“Give me a little time, ISAAC GORDON,
Just a little time for turning round,'” said he.
“What's a paltry fifty pound, ISAAC GORDON ?
A paltry fifty pound, it is nought 'twixt you and me.
They told me you were kind, ISAAC GORDON,
And treated all your clients tenderly.
You wear a pleasant smile,
And I'm sure you 're free from guile,
And I'm drifting to the Dismal Court, the Court of Bankruptcy."
And it's never, never, never, ISAAC GORDON,
Never you that precious fifty pound will see,
Though you call him names by letter, ISAAC GORDON,
And put in an execution on his private property.
You have flung away your cash into the gutter,
And have set the law in motion uselessly.
For the creditors distrain,
And the brokers“ broke” in vain,

(In humble imitation of that very clever
play “ The Weather-Hen," now running
at the Comedy.)

Regent's Park.
Mrs. Prior. I do wish, MARVEL, you
wouldn't write your plays in my boudoir.
They 're not at all the sort of plays which
ought to be written in a lady's boudoir.
Marvel (looking up from his writing).
They're far too improper to be written
in my study.
Mrs. Prior. At least you might refrain

deplorable nicknames. Do, to oblige me.
Mrs. Prior (proudly). JIMMY and I are

conversation. Such a pretty habit!
Marvel. Ah, you mean Mr. FERGUSON,

who always glares at one with the whites
of his eyes, in conversation. I wish you'd
speak to him about it.

me to leave your roof?

think I do.

you may continue to carry on your intrigue

1. How to get rid of an organ-man, with or without monkey,
in less than two minutes, without violence or any exertion.
2. How to send a German band packing at one minute's notice
without aid of police, and without any overpowering exertion.
3. How to stop at once those terrible nuisances, cab-calling
whistles, which only afford maidservants a pretext for going
out into the street for a chat with somebody, and to the man-
servant an excuse for “going out for a blow," while their
shrill sounds, frequently repeated at short intervals, rouse
sleepers, startle invalids, and cry to “the sleeper awakened”
as Macbeth's conscience cried to its owner, “Sleep no more !"
Then, on the first ten minutes' worth of calls remaining un-
answered, the whistling is repeated for a quarter of an hour or
more, before it occurs to the blower to run in search of the
vehicle wanted.
• The present inquirer would like the new magistrate, and
every magistrate for the matter of that, to issue a circular
strongly recommending the general use of electric communica-
tion with a local central office, whence can be “rung up,” at all
hours and in all weathers, without troubling the servants, a cab,
a doctor, a messenger, a fireman, or a policeman. The present
inquirer is not a shareholder in such a company, but he pays so
much a year to it, and twopence or so whenever its agency is
employed for cab-fetching, message-taking, and so forth; and if
others would only do likewise they would save their servants'
breath, and cease to cause their neighbours much irritation.
A long course of villainous street organs killed poor JOHN
LEECH, and it may soon be expected that on hearing how some
literary man living in London is stricken down, we shall, on
inquiry, find that he is “suffering from a severe attack of
Whistles.” If the new magistrate can and will assist his fellow
“Beaks” in checking and stopping such nuisances in all
districts, then this appeal from the studies, atéliers, bed-rooms,
and sick-rooms of London to a GARRETT will not have been
made in vain.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In The White King of Manoa (HUTCHINSON), Mr. JOSEPH HATTON
presents a careful and picturesque study of the time of Sir
WALTER RALEIGH. We have vivid glimpses of the streets of
London in the spacious times of Queen ELIZABETH—the spacious-
ness, bien entendu, not a quality pertaining to the thoroughfares.
With Mr. HATTON as guide, we see the narrow ways filled by a
motley crowd in russet doublet and hose, the women with square
cut bodices, laced stomachers, and cunningly slashed sleeves.
Coming to town from Devonshire, David Yarcombe, like another
hero of romance fixed at the same epoch, goes Westward Ho.
How he makes his way into the Inca's sacred city of Manoa, how
he is hailed as a messenger from the Sun God, how he rules the
people, fights the Spanish and gets back to faithful Lucy Withy-
combe waiting for him in Devon is a stirring story my Baronite
recommends to the reader in search of a holiday book.
The Sport of Circumstance is a plain tale of very human
interest, admirably told in one volume by C. G. CHATTERTON.
The false scent, that allures the interested reader away from
the right track, is so artistically laid, that almost up to the end
the true road leading to the goal is left doubtful to the deeply
interested reader. But what vagary caused Mr. JOHN LANE,
the publisher, to choose so unattractive a cover, and so to
place the title, throughout the book, as to make every page,
with its clear type and large margin, look as if it were a speci-
men page? This is distracting.
Of all the attractive articles contained in The Anglo-Saxon
Review, already briefly noticed by the Baron, Lord ROSEBERY'S
critical essay on “The Great Sir ROBERT PEEL” will be the first
to attract the majority of readers. Approbation from his literary
lordship is praise indeed, and Mr. PARKER, as editor of these
PEEL Papers, must be a proud and happy man on finding his
labours thus highly appreciated by so capable and so cynical a
critic. In the Baron's opinion, this essay is a perfect work of
its kind, indeed, a very model; and, as one dish in the menu of
Lady RANDOLPH's literary banquet, it is so satisfying, that all
the other plats, excellent though they may be, seem to run
some chance of being merely tasted or entirely neglected. Omne
ignotum pro magnifico, and ROSEBERY on PEEL is Pelion on Ossa, John Leighton
which it will be admitted is sufficient to last the most voracious
pike of a reader for a clear quarter of the year.

THE DEMOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST
TABLE.
“NE SIT ANCILLA TIBI AMOR PUDORI."
(Lines faintly suggested by a speech of
Mr. LABOUCHERE'S on the Food and Drugs
Bill, and written with respectful acknow-
ledgments to the late Mr. CORNEY GRAIN.)
I do not ask that life should flow
In steady streams of milk and honey;
Not that my portion here below
Should prove exceptionally sunny;
Content with little, getting less,
I neither strive nor shout;
But find in peace my happiness
With honour, or without.
Let others thirst for fortune's dower
And goodly settlements in Goshen,
In me the thought of wealth and power
Produces no profound emotion ;
I do not crave for gilded gear
Or crushings from the mine,
And were I asked to be a Peer
I know I should decline.
I count the love of costly drinks
Among the very lowest vices;
To stay my stomach when it sinks
A pewter-pot of ale suffices;
Pleased with my frugal plate of sprats
I want no full-sized fish,
Nor last for butter laid in pats
Upon a lordly dish.
Desire of women, soft and fair,
Sets not this humble heart a-swelling;
Give me a homely wench to share
My unaffected cot, or dwelling;
Not rich in charms, but well enough,
With plain ingredients graced,
She is fulfilled of such a stuff
As suits my simple taste.
Solid of substance, even dense,
Perhaps a trifle pallid-looking,
She serves my need at small expense
For purposes of general cooking;
The pattern of the perfect wife
A working-man should wed,
To lubricate his wheels of life
And oil his daily bread.
At times as though to touch my heart
And rise a little in my favour,
I see her try some trick of art
To make her dull complexion braver;
Worldly device of woman's wit!
What should she know of that?
A rustic nature rudely knit
Of beef and mutton fat!

OPERATIC NOTES.
July 17.-Alas, poor YORICK ! Opera season slowly coming to
an end, and, like the dying swan, singing sweetly to the last.
A propos of swan, Lohengrin. Mlle. STRAKOSCH a charming Elsa,
singing well; MARIE BREMA as Ortruda, splendid both as to
voice and acting ; Herr DIPPEL as the hero, good.
Wednesday being the night of Mr. Punch's Hebdomadal Board
and Cabinet Council, it was impossible for His Special Repre-
sentative to be present at the second performance of Messaline,
and on Friday-alas !-a previous engagement, entered into ere
he had foreseen the possibility of a third representation of
Messaline, prevented his attendance, so, quoting BYRON, he
observed at 8 P.M., Friday,
“'Tis now the promised hour, that must proclaim
The life or death of LARA's future fame,
i.e., as far as this opera is concerned. Perhaps on the stage of
Covent Garden, DE
"LARA, too, is there,
With self-confiding, coldly patient air,"
expecting Mr. Punch's final verdict. For at the première it was
impossible to decide. No doubt
“The first success to LARA's numbers clung."
And then follows a line-absit omen-
“But that vain victory hath ruin'd all.”
“So mote it not be"; and should the Ruling Operatic Powers,
embodied in the Sagacious Syndicate, decide to reproduce
Messaline in the early weeks of the next season, then may Mr.
P.'s Representative be there to see, hear, and to determine.
Till then M. ISIDORE DE LARA's work can stand down to come
up for judgment when called upon.
Monday.—The Last Night of Opera announced, with MELBA as
the final firework, so that it may not fizzle out, but depart with
a bang! In our regretted absence, may the Diva be there in
the best of health and voice to sing the part of Juliette, and may
she return to us next year better than ever, if that be possible.
Sic transit gloria Operae Coventgardenensis. Hope Sagacious
Syndicate is Satisfied. Hope, likewise, that their “ friends in
front" are equally pleased. What sort of a sing-song season
has it been ? Well-nothing very startling; nothing that has
been “the talk of the town." It has pursued “the even tenor”
(soprano, etc.) “ of its way,” and if it has made an “even
tenner,” says WAGSTAFF, who can't resist the chance," or so,
out of it, why so much the better for the Successful Syndicate."
Till next season, farewell. Valete, et plaudite!

The tramway still runs through the west door of this same

takes the record for an architectural freak.
The half-mile of Maliebaan (six rows of lime trees) is in full

THE POINT OF VIEW.-III.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Having been com-
pelled, during the last few years, to
devote a large amount of valuable time to
the question of EDUCATION, I trust you will
allow me to express a perfectly unbiassed
opinion on the subject. The danger before
us is overpressure. That will be admitted
generally by all thoughtful scholars, no
matter of what school. It seems to me,
then, that many of the so-called “lessons"
might be banished altogether from the cur-
riculum, and that the time thus gained-
not already occupied by the usual holidays
(which might be lengthened)—could be
devoted to strengthening the physical
basis, by recourse to cricket, to football,
and to other manly sports. A scarcely less
important grievance lies in the vexed
question of pocket-money. There can be
little doubt that parsimonious habits are
engendered by any undue restrictions in
the usual weekly allowance. This should
be given with a free hand, so that a liberal
attitude in regard to all trifling luxuries
can be learned in youth. Further liberty
might be accorded in the matter of hours
for rest, and it would probably be found a
wise course in the case of public schools,
to provide each student with a latchkey,
and to abolish all irritating restrictions as
to “bounds."
There are other points that I would have
liked to have touched on, as, for example,
the catapult (a most valuable means of
acquiring a knowledge of municipal govern-

THE COUNTY (COURT, JUDGE.
p“ There should be a Court of females to try these dressmakers' cases
Ladies would be better judges of these things than I.”—Judge Emden.]
Oh! pity my sorrows, and give without grudge
Your sympathy kind to a County Court Judge;
I crave your compassion, for all will agree
That if I try the men, still the women try me.
How can a mere male be expected to tell
If a bodice is cut à la mode and fits well ?
How settle the merits of corsets when he
Hasn't got the least notion what corsets may be ?
As a County Court Judge, I'm expected to know
The milliners' laws and the profits also,
But though I have lived in a gown, I confess
I've the vaguest ideas concerning a dress.
MOORE's Handbook I've read till I'fuddled my brains,
I know about railways but not about trains ;
And the Court is convulsed and the dressmakers score,
When a skirt has been cut and I can't find the gore.
In cases like this it is obvious then
That women are far and away the best men,
And I therefore propose that the Bench be supplied
With one or two females, such suits to decide.
They needn't, of course, know too much Greek or Latin ;
What boots Roman law, if they know Roman satin ?
They'd take to the Bench like a baby to milk,
For we'd limit selection to those that wear silk.
Such a court would sweep clean as a newly bought besom ;
They'd dress the dressmakers that sought to address 'em;
We'd soon hear the end of this milliners' fudge,
And life would be sweet to the County Court Judge.

THE POINT OF VIEW.-IV.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,—The “Great Servant
Question” is coming to a crisis. As I
said to a friend of inine last night, what
young ladies in service want is more
liberty. They must have time for biking
and other amusements, and for “walking
out,”—which is most important. As to
“no fringe”; well, I never heard such
impertinence. And those hideous caps
and aprons too! Why, if a young lady
can't dress as she likes where's the use of
being anything ?
If you want to make your servants
cheerful and obliging, don't bother them
with orders. Leave them to do everything
their own way, and I think you will be
surprised! It would be a good plan to
take turns with them in the kitchen. Why
shouldn't the mistress cook the dinner
three days a week, while the master might
wash up and break the usual quantity of
china ? The cook could sit in the dining-
room, where she might entertain her
friends, whilst the table-maid might prac-
tise her piano-lessons in the drawin“-

MR. WILFRED WOOLLAM, believing that I am not, save owing
to some accident or blúnder, ignoring Child Illa and Other
Poems, by WILFRED WOOLLAM (Sheffield, J. A. BAIN ; London,
SIMPKIN AND MARSHALL), ventures to ask if the volume duly
reached me. Many influential journals, it appears, failed to
receive their allotted copies, and Punch may have failed where
neither the Spectator nor the Daily Chronicle-so Mr. WOOLLAM
informs me-succeeded. I know not. On the Baron's shelves
are many volumes, and perchance on some inaccessible shelf
Child Illa may be reposing, with the dust of eight months lying
thick upon her. Step-ladders and investigation are alike un-
necessary, I am glad to say, for Mr. WOOLLAM, with a generosity
that does equal credit to his heart and his head, has sent me a
fresh copy of his soul's outpourings, which, at his special
request, I now proceed to examine.
It appears that in an ancient land, date uncertain (“when it
boots none to know," says Mr. WOOLLAM), a knight had been
for seven years engaged in the seductive and mysterious occu-
pation of riding to and fro over the turf and by the surf. He
was all alone, “But letters from the king he bore And the mien
of high degree," just as on a celebrated occasion Miss Bolus
went home in a flood of tears and a sedan chair. This knight
never supped twice in the same place (“And never twice o'er
festive board His smile or jest was thrown"), but having
supped, he saddled and flew-I retain in my prose as much as
possible of the original poetry-sighing “Not there," while
io his steed's hoofs cried, The Past! The Past! The Past!'”
which, I may remark in passing, is a cry that the merely mortal
hoofs of no self-respecting earthly steed have ever emitted in
my hearing. But then I never heard them say "Proputty," or
anything else, so I daresay Mr. WOOLLAM is right all the same.
However, the knight came to Child Illa's castle and stayed
there seven days. Child Illa, it should be noted, was a lady;
she had nothing to do with Childe Harold or Childe Roland, who
to the dark tower came; she was a different sort of child
altogether, and the mysterious knight fell in love with her-in
fact, he went on loving her till, by a pine-roofed, lonely shrine,
he told her his name was Dondelume. This didn't startle her at
all, for when the knight added that none knew it, and that
'twas seven years gone since one had called him Dondelume,
she merely remarked, “It will be known to fame." Shortly
after this there was a battle, though I can't quite make out Little Ethel. "MR. Rich, WE 'RE NOT ALL MADE. OF DUST, ARE
what it was about, and Sir Dondelume took part in it. Just WE?" Mr. Rich (benignly). “YES, MY DEAR,"
before it began he received from Child Illa a curt message Little Ethel (triumphantly). “OH, WELL, YOU AREN'T, 'cos PAPA

historic glen by a crowd of tramps with
firearms, who come, they say, “ to make

should be. Even Parliament, I am told,
was “up” three days ago, that the M.P.s

seems, are more important than Old Age

THE STORY OF A CRISIS. A.D. 19—.
. (Communicated by Mr. Punch's Vagrant.)
(By African Cable from Our Special Correspondent.)
Vineyardtown, Nabothsland, August 1.-Grave events have
taken place here. For a long time past British residents in this
country have had to complain of intolerable oppression, which
culminated yesterday in a decree issued by the so-called legis-
lature and signed by King KOKO. By this decree access to the
Royal Rum-Palaces is denied to all foreigners who cannot produce
a certificate of having resided five months in the country. The
British Rum-Drinkers Association has issued a fiery protest,
and a petition is being extensively signed for presentation to
the QUEEN. Relations between the British residents and the
native blacks are strained almost to breaking point, and unless
strong measures are taken by the British Government, it is felt
that England will be permanently disgraced. A member of the
legislature has just drunk a quart of rum defiantly in the pre-
sence of a large gathering of Englishmen, who were compelled
to endure this outrage in silence. If this continues, the worst
is feared.
(Extract from Leading Article in the Daily T-l-gr-ph, August 2.)
Our patience has been abused, our moderation has been inter-
preted as cowardice, and all our efforts to secure justice for our
fellow-subjects have been met by trickery and evasion. The
question goes far deeper than the mere right to drink rum with-
out vexatious restrictions. Our position as a world power is
involved, and not all the taunts of Little Englanders can bring
us to abate one jot or tittle of our just demands. Let King
KOKO take heed while there is yet time. War may be dis-
tasteful to us, but there is something worse than war, and that
is dishonour. We are glad to recognise from the tone of the
Colonial Secretary that there will be no shrinking on his part.
In the meantime the worst friends of peace are those who, in
the House of Commons or the press, belittle the righteous claims
of the British Rum-Drinkers Association.'

My conscience, at any rate, is clear. At the very outset
of these negotiations I explained to King KOKO that he was

out of home and Pisa. In this little volume we have the better
part of a man of genius, a master of the English tongue.
Why should I have been selected to review Willow The King,
by J. C. SNAITH (WARD, LOCK & Co.)? Am I fit for the
stupendous task, I whose active cricketing days came to a
timely end just a quarter of a century ago, I of whom it was
then written in “Characters of the School Eleven," that I was
"a hard hitter without sufficient defence; wild, but often
successful, bowler; good field on his day"? Is this a proper
qualification for one who is to pronounce an opinion on a book
which is practically one long scoring-book, with a love episode
thrown in, and of which the characters talk familiarly of certain
august beings, wielders of the willow and compilers of scores,
as “STODDY," "RANJI,” “CLEM. HILL," and "JIMMY DOUGLAS”?
Obviously it is not, and, therefore, if I err in anything let Mr.
SNAITH impute the blame, not to myself, the slave of duty, but
to the Baron who—see how infectious the book is !-sent me to
the wicket and told me to do what I liked with the bowling.
I may say then that Mr. SNAITH has written a lively book in a
style that is almost exuberantly lively, and that every devotee
of cricket will find much in it to amuse and delight him.
Nowhere else has this humble writer seen so good a description
of the wretched nervousness that afflicts a conscientious young
cricketer who has to go in first in a big match. And there are
other incidents equally well described. But do all cricketers
talk the fearful, the perpetual slang that is talked by Mr.
SNAITH's heroes ? His heroine, Miss Laura Trentham, the
cricketing sister of four superlative cricketers, is in slang the
worst of the family. “I know the HORACE father means," she
observes, alluding to the friend of VIRGIL and MÆCENAS,
"a fat old bounder who was always thirsty. Awful fond of
wine he was, awful fond. Don't think he was ever in condition.
As for his jaw, it was something frightful.” Even amidst the
protection of the context these terrible words, and many others
of a similar nature, jar on the ear with the sound of a misused
slate-pencil. However, Mr. Dimsdale had to marry this lady,
slang and all, and from the epilogue I gather he did it like a
man. His life will evidently not be all beer and skittles, though
it will certainly consist largely of stone-ginger and cricket.
Mr. GUY BOOTHBY, in his story entitled Love Made Manifest

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MESSRS. J. M. Dr . of Aldine House, are hereby compli-
mented on having
at the sixty-fifth (is it not ?) volume
of their excellent series of English classics in prose and
poetry, whereof the latest specimen immediately under the
Baron's notice, but not by any means “ beneath” it, is Men
and Women, by ROBERT BROWNING. Of this work the first
edition was published in 1855, ere the poet's latterday man-
nerisms had not infrequently obscured his meaning even from
the intelligence of the highly-favoured elect. Such easily
portable editions, as this and a somewhat similar set of Sir
WALTER SCOTT's novels from the same firm, appeal to the
general reading public, and especially to that portion of it
which may be distinguished as “Travelling Fellows.".
Transgression, by S. S. THORBURN (PEARSONS), is a study of
Indian life, full of interest and variety. It opens in the Resi-
dent's house in Pechistan, on the north-west frontier of India,
and after an adventurous progress ends peacefully, if not
happily, in a quiet little Cornish village. Mr. THORBURN
evidently knows his locale well, and has managed very skilfully
to work into an exciting narrative some vivid pictures of our
perpetual little wars with the hill tribes. At one point the
Baron's Retainer thinks the author has made an artistic mistake
-where, having brought his particularly unheroic hero into
troubles that drive him to the last pitch of despair, he suddenly
turns from narrative and apostrophises the luckless gentleman
in terms of unmeasured reproach. This, considering that Mr.
THORBURN himself has created him, and devised the imbroglio in
which he finds himself, strikes the aforesaid Retainer as a little
unsportsmanlike. Apart from this lapse, however, the story is
well written and eminently readable.
My Baronite has conscientiously read through from cover to
cover The Patroness (HUTCHINSON), and finds it a trifle tiresome.
Mr. GEORGE has essayed to steep his story in the colour and
atmosphere of Wales. He has succeeded. Unhappily the
colour is akin to that of a slate quarry, and the atmosphere is
dank and depressing.
The Human Boy, by EDEN PHILLPOTTS (METHUEN), is a collection
of papers intended to illustrate boyish life at an imaginary
private school which has to a certain extent adopted some of
the characteristics of Eton and Harrow. Many of the episodes
are genuinely humorous, and as the connecting threads are of
the slightest possible material, the book can be taken up at odd
times, and any chapter will serve to wile away a spare quarter
of an hour.
In Giles Ingilby, by W. E. NORRIS (METHUEN), we have a
first-rate and most appetising literary dish, cooked and served
up by an artistic adept at making the very oldest materials
stimulating to the palates of the most jaded romance devourers.

With meditative weed ;
When curling through my prison bars,
The smoke goes rolling free,

And round the smoking-room we sit
In easy deshabille ;

Our last racing stroke has been rowed, oh my oar.
And thus of the story that bound us together,
That made you my servant and kept you my friend

The last word is spoken, and now comes the end.
Many oars have I had—lo! these cups are a token-

But their staunchness lived on to be centred in you.

The traditions are yours of those blades I have done with;
The wood may have changed, but the soul is the same.
Great days of rejoicing and strength and endeavour,
When the blood galloped swift, and the muscles were taut,
So brightly they shone, that are vanished for ever,
My heart from their radiance a glamour has caught.
And still, though the grey in my hair be increasing,
Though the joints may be stiffened, the sinews unstrung,
The brightness is round me, and still without ceasing
I think and remember and dream and am young.
One day I recall when we hardly were ready,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

“SWIMIMUS!"
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - Bravo, “SPORTING NOTIONS,” of the
Referee, for his sage remarks anent education in the art of
swimming being made compulsory in all our schools. There
is one great and solid fact to back him up. In bygone years
deaths from drowning were constantly occurring among the
boys at Eton. Since “ passing" for swimming (without which
test no lad is allowed to boat) there has not been a single fatal
catastrophe on the river. When I was at Eton I had to pass
in my clothes," i.e., I had to wear ordinary boating dress. I did
so successfully, and afterwards won two prizes for swimming
in the school, contests. I feel very strongly on this subject,
when reading year after year of the dreadful loss of life, which
occurs from lack of natatory instruction. Even sailors in the
Royal Navy are not obliged to be able to swim. It is the duty
of the Government to insist upon drastic reform in this matter.
There are more deaths from drowning than from hydrophobia.
And, worst of all, many gallant men and women who can swim
are drowned in cases of attempted rescue by those who can't.
Let every boy and girl in Great Britain and Greater Britain be
a“ naut.''
Yours faithfully, OLIM ETONENSIS.
P.S.—The greatest of English kings learnt swimming, and
evidently at Eton! Who has not heard of “The Passing of
Arthur''?
The Financial Times states that "a branch of PARR's Bank
will be opened at Margate.” Will the name be slightly changed,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S REPRESENTATIVE AT
RENNES.
LAST week Mr. Punch announced the
departure of his Principal Foreign Cor-
respondent. The recent riots in Paris
have doubtless caused widespread anxiety
as to the fate of this heroic man, who,
alone and defenceless, set out upon an
arduous journey to a foreign town,
occupied by opposing factions of violent
partisans. Such is Rennes. The risks
which he so bravely encountered must
have struck a chill to every sympathetic
heart. The fact that he has not yet
arrived there proves that his discretion is
equal to his valour. Mr. Punch has re-
ceived the following despatches from this
courageous correspondent.
ROUEN.-Having succeeded in reaching
Dieppe, and finding no actual civil war in
progress there, I thought it my duty to
advance as far as possible. On arrival
here I went to the hotel most frequented
by the English, and therefore least likely
to be patronised by the Anti-dreyfusards.
The presence of three English clergymen
at the table d'hôte was reassuring. How-
ever, I discovered afterwards that a strike
of workmen had begun. Also I noticed at
the chief café that every one was reading
the reports of the trial at Rennes. They
all looked peaceful business men, but at
moments of political excitement a foreigner
is safer when he is absent. Resolve to
leave and to go to Havre, whence I could
escape on a British ship. Have not yet
reached Rennes.
HAVRE.-Fearing lest I might travel alone
in a railway-carriage with some violent
Anti-dreyfusard - perhaps with ROCHE-
FORT, or JUDET, or DRUMONT-I came here
by the river steamer. At the moment of
starting, discovered that I was the only
Englishman on board. Should I be

“The morning and evening programmes were of the most

and enterprise which have turned a useless and obsolete ruin
into a home of refined and up-to-date entertainment for the

The next extract is so utterly improbable, so foreign to all
our cherished national prejudices and traditions, that Mr. Punch
can only give it with the utmost reserve, and without for a
moment pledging himself to any faith in his clairvoyant's
accuracy in this particular instance.
EXTRACT NO. VII. (Leader from Morning Paper, October', 1899.)
"At last, we are glad to learn, the Government has awoke to the
necessity of preserving Stonehenge, which is to be acquired in
trust for the Nation at a price to be settled by arbitration.
Every precaution is to be taken to preserve it from further
decay, and the Public may now rest assured that England will
be spared the disgrace of having permitted either the removal
or desecration of one of its most famous relics."

But the King, being informed by one of
the tale-bearers, sent for the holy dar-
weesh and admonished him, saying:
“Dost not perceive that it is for pity of
the rabbit that I shoot him unaware as he
sitteth ; lest to the pain of death should
be added that of terror and much waste of
breathing in flight?”.
But the darweesh, hanging the head of
incredulity, said: “0 King, were I a
rabbit, I would choose to have some
exercise for my pelf (a run for my
money)."
But the King, interpreting this word as
meaning to say that he were like to miss
a rabbit in motion, bade the holy dar-
weesh estimate at what speed he was
capable of running across the line of the
King's vision.
“For I would gladly know," said he,
“ what allowance I should give to the aim
of my arrow, that thou and it may not fail
to collide."
But the holy darweesh said to himself :
“O my two ears!” But aloud he cried :
“My lord, mayest thou reign intermin-
ably! Thy servant knoweth full well
that no rabbit, ran he never so swift,
could escape thy shaft. Therefore of thy
mercy alone it is that thou selectest such
as sit tight, so saving them much fear,
together with the annoyance of being over-
taken in running."

COME live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove,
That modern and suburban life
Can give to husband and to wife.
A sordid villa we will seek
(Ten shillings is the rent per week),
Where you shall dwell the livelong day,
At Shepherd's Bush or Holloway.
There of an evening I will scowl
And smoke my pipe and grunt and growl,
While, as the Pekoe I imbibe,
Our slavey's failings you describe.
There you shall cook and wash and drudge
While I each extra sixpence grudge,
And sallow baby cries and squalls
In unmelodious intervals.
Thus working early, late, and hard,
Dress by degrees you'll disregard,
While I'in raiment neat and new

THE POINT OF VIEW.-VII.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, I have been reading
all this correspondence about 'buses and,
as one who spends a large portion of the
day in a 'bus, may I be allowed to say that
'buses are far too large and too heavy for
comfort ? They should be made of bamboo
or papier maché, and in every case three
or four horses should be employed. The
horse is the most important part of the
'bus, though the heedless public don't
seem to know it. They want soft seats,
stools for their feet, electric light, room
for their elbows, &c., &c., and all for the
blessed penny !! but never a thought for
the poor horses that are pulling them along
the slippery wood-pavement! A woman
would stop a 'bus every two minutes to
save her five yards walking, and the men
aren't much better. Ask the driver; he
will tell you that it is the stoppings and

DARBY JONES AWAKES ON THE

HONOURED SIR, You will no doubt be
as surprised as was the Traditional Cat
when it escaped from the Proverbial Bag
at receiving this communication from your
ancient and possibly, nay probably, for-
gotten Adherent, but nevertheless, I can-
not refrain from tipping you a few lines,
now that I am once more enabled to
employ my digits, on the subject of the
glorious Leger. Ah ! Sir, writing as I do
from a spot reeking with the blood of
Hispanian cattle, it does me good to refer
to the Northern Epsom, better known to
Geographers as Doncaster. It is a Town
distinguished for Hard Roads, Hard Going,
Hard Food, Hard Men, and Hard Bake, but
it is also remarkable for Soft Surprises.
As my old friend, the Count, remarked to
me last night at the Casino, “Doncaster
is as difficult to determine as the age of
one's Unmarried Sister."
I will not weary you, Honoured Sir, with
my reasons, but, untrammelled with Wire-
less Telegraphy, I submit the following
Doggrel to the appreciation of yourself and
your readers :
The Duchess of York may get a place,
Of the Crocodile don't despair,
But Reynard should surely win the race

who can so far forget his sacred duty of preaching peace and
goodwill and the gospel of mercy as to incite his countrymen to
bloodshed and rapine and subjugation. American clergymen may
do this, but Englishmen-and lo, as I pursued this eminently
British and condescending train of thought, my eyes fell upon
your letter in the Times.
Now, let us understand one another. Those who think as I do
are not posing as thick and thin defenders of every action
of the Transvaal Republic. We may freely admit that they
have made many mistakes, but, even granting for argument's
sake that the Transvaal has committed misdeeds far beyond
the limits of our admission, we see no ground for war or
for the blustering threats that make war more probable. For
of what kind would this war be? I can give the answer
in words not my own: “A war in South Africa would be
one of the most serious wars that could possibly be waged.
It would be a long war, a bitter war and a costly war, and,
as I have pointed out already, I believe generations would
hardly be able to blot it; and to go to war with President
KRÜGER, to enforce upon him reforms in the internal affairs of
his State, in which Secretaries of State, standing in their place,
have repudiated all right of interference—that would be a
course of action which would be immoral.” These are not the
words of a des pised Little Englander; they were spoken in the
House of Commons in 1896 by that great Panjandrum, Mr. JOSEPH
CHAMBERLAIN himself, and no word of mine can add to their
force or increase their value.
But evidently, as I must admit with sorrow, they do not
express the opinion of at least one Reverend Canon of Rochester,
for when Dr. NEWMAN HALL announced his intention of rallying
the members of the Free Churches to protest against war, he
roused a red-hot passion of indignation in your ecclesiastical
breast.. Here are some of the gems from your effusion :
“Stringent measures are needed. .... War is sometimes a
duty, and never could the duty be more clear than in this case
unless the Boers attend to the just demands of their suzerain.
.... Crimes may be engendered by an over love of peace. ...
If there be one plain duty for Great Britain it is to be careful

A CASTLE LINER.
(Notes from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.) |
R.M.S. Kinfauns Castle. In the Clyde,
Thursday.-The Member for Sark well
remembers his first voyage to the Cape.
Mentions no date, but evidently some
years ago. It was on board the Hoyden,
a barque of 280 tons, and among the
passengers was CAP'EN TOMMY BOWLES.
He wasn't a Cap'en then, but made up for
the deficiency by having the regulation
number of arms and legs, since laid on the
altar of his country and there calcined.
Even in those early days the sitting
Member for King's Lynn was remarkable
for his mental and physical activity.
SARK recalls a curious instance. One
evening when the Hoyden was restlessly
rocking amid the Roaring Forties, TOMMY,
lolling astride a water-cask, reading the
. Will
Life of Pitt, suddenly started and listened
intently. Softly dropping the volume
into the lee scuppers, he ran aft along the
taffrail till he reached the jib-boom.
Skirting it half a point to starboard, he
listened again. At six bells he tacked
and resumed his old position.
"What were you up to?” SARK asked.
“Nothing," said TOMMY, disconsolately.
"I thought I heard HICKS-BEACH making a
bargain with the CHANCELLOR OF THE
EXCHEQUER.”
It is another and a trivial story. Only
it shows how the man is father to the boy.
The contrast between the Hoyden and
the Kinfauns Castle, latest château en
Fenchurch Street, is as marked as was the
difference between the Ark and the May-
flower, in which Sir BASHMEAD-ARTLETT'S
forefathers fared forth to found Empire
in the West, and pick up anything going
in the way of tramway and electric light-
ing concessions.
** That's where blood tells," said the

documents accompanying a bound copy of

Caramella (ARROWSMITH) is just delightful. Of late the
Englishman who accidentally drops in upon a foreign Principality,
and by swift steps ascends the throne, is like the poor inasmuch
as he is always with us. Mr. HAWTREY follows the familiar
lines, but they fall in the pleasantest of places, and assume
quite new curves and angles. The island of Caramella is lotus
land, and we make the acquaintance of a crowd of charming
people. It is a land where all the men are, though not brave,
big, and all the women beautiful. When the hero, Jack

brings ashore a squad of British bluejackets to restore him to
his position of President of the Republic, the beauty of the
women proved embarrassing. In vain the lieutenant in command,
himself hopelessly smitten, called out, “Eyes front, men! Eyes
front!” The bluejackets did their best to obey. But, as Mr.
HAWTREY says, there are moments when the most magnificent
discipline is powerless to keep the eyes under control. Cara-

Foreign Powers; it has a Colonial Office, but no colonies; a
paper currency, but no gold reserve; a Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, but no system of taxation; an army, but no arms.
Nobody works, but every one is well off, eats the lotus in the
afternoon, and is serenely happy. Here and there my Baronite
detects intent of determined satire at the expense of another

bold in treading the path where the master led so brilliantly.
The main theme is fascinating, and has been conceived with a
big imagination; the description of the first launch of the
wonderful aërial destroyer holds us spell-bound as we read, and
the mighty machinations of the British Syndicate that starve

| produced on the stage, necessitates detailed descriptions of
scenes and characters, and therefore requires the art of a master
at dramatisation, and at his hands demands more care than
is required for a stage-play where so much is left to the actor.
Otherwise the plot will be obscured by wearisome conversations,
and the bewildered reader is then sorely tempted to refer at
once to the final tableau as a short cut towards ascertaining
the goal the author has been attempting to keep in view. The
Philosophy of the Marquise is an instance of this ; nor is it at all
easy to discover the raison d'être of the title. There is some
sort of a plot to be worked out by a group of characters, in not
one of whom, after they have once been fairly wound up and
set a-going, could the Baron, with the best will in the world,
take even a languid interest. There is a momentary gleam of
hope let in on the reader by one of the characters, whose Anglo-
French recalls THACKERAY's delightful Monsieur de Florac; but
the glimmer disappears.
The Rose of Judah, by GEORGE GRIFFITH (PEARSONS), is a tale
of the Captivity, a romance of ancient Babylon, introducing
DANIEL, BELSHAZZAR, and the rest. BELSHAZZAR was both regal
and lascivious, and came to a bad end. The Rose of Judah has
a happy end, but, like all Babylonian romances, it is highly
improper and disagreeable and suggestive. However, nobody
is compelled to read it.
A Riviera Romance (DOWNEY & Co.), by the late BLANCHE
ROOSEVELT, Marchesa D'ALLEGRI, may have been out some time
(it bears this present year's date of publication), but it has only
recently come within the Baron's ken, and he confesses to
having been deeply interested in it. The story is original, the
events are natural, the actors in the romantic drama of real life

Nature as seen at its most natural, in the gardens, the restau-
rants, and the gambling saloons of Monte Carlo. A final wild
and wanton orgie, leading up to the tragic climax, is so boldly
and vividly described as possibly to startle not a few sedate and
inexperienced persons out of their propriety, causing them to
ejaculate, “Is it possible! What madness! What idiocy!”

My friends, I fear that hitherto,
Owing to management inactive,
Considered in a "publio" view,
Our libraries are unattractive;

We scorn the former dispensation,
And for the evils of the past
Propose a scheme of reformation.

rain soaks gently through any opening into the passengers'

(In memory of the verdict of Rennes.)
Not when, at close of that disastrous day,
The downward charge of England's gathered might
Broke on your veteran barriers outworn
With the long equal fight,
And in a little hour
The dear-won glory of NAPOLEON'S power
Passed as a sunset cloud,
Swept with the mist of battle-smoke away-
Not then with other shame your head was bowed

Not when the Prussian leaguer fenced you fast,
And furth from Sedan's stricken gates
A watching world aghast
Beheld you yield the very flower of France,
Ill-ordered, ill-controlled, with none for guide,
Untaught to fight at odds against the Fates ;-
Not when through Paris, crown of Europe's pride,
Low in the dust with all her splendour spoiled,
Ringed round, those many months, with famine and flame,
Forlorn her faith in God, her courage foiled,
Over your dead with glittering lance
The conquering Uhlan leapt;-
Not then we left you lonely in your shame;
We wept with you that wept.
And from that ruin how you rose again,
Indomitably crushing down despair,
Resilient by your energy of race,
Washing your scarred escutcheon clear of stain,

AN OPEN LETTER.
DEAR SIR,-1t is to your influential
columns that I would address myself on a
subject which has caused me considerable
grievance and annoyance. One Saturday
night recently I purposed to dine at a res-
taurant in the neighbourhood of Piccadilly
Circus with a friend. On his recommenda-
tion, we chartered a cab at St. James's
Park Station, as it appeared well nigh im-
possible to walk across the Park owing to
the crowd and the number of policemen
who; stood and barred all ways with
waving arms. However, we had made no
further progress than some hundred yards,
when our conveyance was arrested by a
minion of the law, and we were forced to
get out and walk. Then our difficulties
began. Finding all ways barred for no
apparent reason, as the voluntary troops
were to be met on all sides in small
groups, which seemed to argue the end
of the review, we were ultimately com-
pelled to steer a circuitous course over
Vauxhall Bridge. Making many a detour,
we at length debouched upon Brook Green.
Wheeling into Hammersmith we route
marched to Piccadilly, where we even-
tually obtained some food at an advanced
hour of the night, hungry, weary, and
with ruffled temper. It would appear
that on all such occasions, the best plan is
to stay indoors until the small hours of the
morning, by which time the metropolis may
present its usual aspect. Military enthu-
siasm is one thing. London for the Lon-
doners another. Of the two I prefer the
latter. Trusting that I have not encroached
too far upon your valuable space, and in
the assured belief that you will espouse
my cause,
I am, &c.,
AN INDIGNANT CIVILIAN.
P.S.— I was once a Volunteer myself-
until they turned me out.

Arrived at the Chine, found the bazaar closed-Sunday; on
week-days you have to purchase an article of the value of
sixpence or over to see the Chine.
Not allowed to see the whale or to go into the bazaar on
Sunday, but charged us sixpence a head to walk down the
Chine, without giving us an article from the bazaar. Isle of
Wight natives are strict Sabbatarians.
Walked down Chine. Very hot, nothing to see. Had to walk
up again; would gladly have given a shilling not to have walked
down Chine. Took the shine out of us.
Went to hotel. Isle of Wight hotels charge exorbitant prices
for tea; had before, never no more. Asked their prices for tea.
Landlady contemptuously referred us to tariff. Tea and bread
and butter sixpence per head. Very good, very reasonable ;
ordered tea for six. Served in garden overlooking sea, very
pleasant; time to be off.
Waiter brought bill. Tea for six, four and six. Asked him to
explain how tea for six at sixpence per head comes to four and
six. Waiter obliges : threepence per head extra for having it
served in garden-no extra charge for use of plates, cups, and
saucers. See quite clearly. Beautiful weather, charming view.
Every thing first-rate. Tea sixpence. Pleasing surroundings
threepence. Cheap at the price. Nature worth the extra
coppers. Quite the old notion of a bargain. Delicious prospect

THE POINT OF VIEW.—No. IX.
Puddleton-on-Sea, Sept. 23.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-For some time past
I have been allowing ladies and gentle-
men to share the comforts of my modest
little home-as paying guests—at a purely
nominal fee. I do not speak of those low
persons who let lodgings, but I think you
will admit that the BRITISH BOARDING
HOUSE is a National Institution, and
should be jealously guarded as such.
Now Sir, the ridiculous luxury permitted
at those huge and vulgar hotels (which
spring up everywhere) is ruining the har-
mony of many of our quiet homes.
Boarders now turn up their noses all day
long, and ring their bells at all hours, as
if they had a right to do so. They must

THE Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking by the sea,
They wept like anything to think
That folks should disagree-
Some saying oysters were not yet
From all infection free.
“O Oysters, come and walk with us,"
The Carpenter besought,
“For it appears that you, my dears,
Were never what we thought;
We fancied you had typhoid germs,
But now we're better taught.”
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
And gave a cunning leer,
The eldest Oyster stroked his beard
The while he seemed to sneer,
And put his fingers to his nose
As if to say, “No fear!”

Walked on a mile at least
Until they came to Colchester,
And there they had a feast.

“No danger in the least."

MORE LITTLE DRIVES IN IRELAND.
LOOKING out very early from my room
in the excellent Shelbourne Hotel at
Dublin, I perceive a grey sky and drizz-
ling rain over St. Stephen's Green. Very
un promising for a picnic. My Irish
friends told me to bring a macintosh.
Shall also take an umbrella, though that
seems quite unusual for a man in this
country. Wish I had two umbrellas.
Nothing like having a change of clothes,
or umbrellas. Imagine picnics in this
climate ! Shall probably wish myself
back again, enjoying a hot luncheon in the
comfortable coffee-room of the Shelbourne,
and indifferent to the weather outside.
However, I start, and meet my friends
at the station. Kind, hospitable Irish
friends! They have brought two extra
waterproofs, of prodigious thickness, for
me. Directly we start the weather be-
comes brilliantly fine and hot, and
throughout the livelong day I, a small
man, have to carry those two massive
waterproofs, my own coat, and the light
cloaks of the two ladies at every change
of train and car. Kind, hospitable Irish
friends! But it is warm work.
For the first time I appreciate the
charms of riding on an Irish car with a
lover of horses, who does all he can to
save fatigue to the nice little mare in this
hired conveyance. Our return journey is
on a sort of switchback road. To walk
uphill for the sake of a horse seems to me
natural enough. The ladies do this. But
the Irish car weighs down the horse when
descending, so my friend and I have to
walk downhill. Happily no one suggests
that it would help the mare if I carried
those immense waterproofs. When there
is a slight rise we all sit forward ; when
there is a slight descent we hang over the
back. As the road is never level we are
in constant movement. For nice healthy
exercise, probably almost as good as polo,
I can recommend such a ride on an Irish
car. Walking is nothing to it.
In this manner we reached Drogheda
station, just in time for the train to Dublin.
But it has been delayed in starting from
litatis
Belfast, so the authorities, noticing a
spare train hanging about, have despatched
the latter to Dublin five minutes before
the advertised time. Of course we could
not catch that, but we catch the real train
half an hour later, and, in spite of my
fears that theso happy-go-lucky people
may send this train to Cork or to Galway,
we ultimately arrive in Dublin, and go on
southwards. The house of my kind,
hospitable friends soon shelters me more
comfortably than their wraps.

there is a recognised tariff for this kind of thing ; so much up
to the knee; so much more for the thigh ; and so on, up to four
figures for the complete destruction of the vision, and rather
more for the widow in the event of victim's decease. I com-
pensated the man very generously for his trivial puncture the
same evening.
In the afternoon I was struck by a change of tactics on the
part of my host. I was constantly requested to walk in adjoin-
ing fields with beetling hedges intervening. Here, I was told, I
should be sure to get some pretty driving shots. But what with
the wind, and the unusual activity of birds arriving from the
next field, I found it extremely difficult even to get my gun in
the right position for perforating them before they had placed
some hundred yards between themselves and immediate risk.
Fortune, however, favoured me just before the close of
operations. An exceptionally swift partridge swung down the
wind over the field of which I held the lonely cominand. Eluding
both my shots, which I made the mistake of directing as if at a
stationary object, it flew carelessly against a telegraph wire
and fell stunned. Reloading with a rapidity which I had pain-
fully attained since the morning, I advanced to within two-and-
a-half yards of the object. His fluttering proved that breath
was not yet extinct, though but little hope could be held out of
his ultimate recovery, even if my hostile attitude were not
taken into account. Drawing a deliberate bead upon him I
discharged both barrels. I am as certain as one can be of
anything connected with a gun that the second shot touched
him. I now closed with my prey; but before describing his
last moments, I am free to say that the spectacle of suffering in
a speechless brute always unmans me; yet, through a certain
physical refinement, I shrank from putting him out of his misery
by the application of my bare hand. Accordingly, half turning
my eyes away, I struck him a few severe blows with the muzzle
(or is it called the stock ?) of my gun. The dying bird chanced
to be leaning against a small boulder which his body partially
obscured. In the result, with the final stroke that extinguished
the bird, I fractured my borrowed weapon somewhere about its
middle. This unfortunate contretemps had the effect of blunting

Was there any doubt expressed as to its success ? Not a bit.
The man in the street, the men in the boats, all talked of it;
and not a single syllable about DREYFUS did I catch at any time
during the day, except when the shrieking brotherhood of news-
paper sellers was let loose on the streets at the hours of various
editions, on which occasions there was just as much noise as
would have been made about “ winners," only there was no
excitement, and consequently rather fewer purchasers than when
persons of all classes “had a bit' on some favourite for the
Grand Prix or any other important race. We, that is two of
our party, and sometimes the four of us, walked, drove, break-
fasted and dined at various restaurants, and with the solitary
exception of an itinerant vendor of papers, who exhibited in
front of the Café de la Paix a scandalously blasphemous carica-
ture à propos of DREYFUS (for which artist, publisher, engraver,
and seller ought all to have been heavily fined and sentenced
to six months with hard labour in proportion to their responsi-
bility), we, with eyes wide open and ears on the alert, neither
saw one single sign, nor heard one single remark, about the
case which, on the strength of our own newspapers at home, we
had been led to believe would be the one absorbing topic every-
where in France and, above all, in Paris.
At luncheon-time did the Stock Exchange men talk about it?
Did they allude to it on the Place de la Bourse, which was just
then about the only crowded spot in Paris ? No: they were
full of stocks and shares and ventures, and of their own and
everybody else's business; but where was "l'affaire Dreyfus”?
Chose jugée. And yet we were all waiting for the pardon, the
news of which was not in Paris on Wednesday last. And then
what happened ? Nothing. The world, that is, the Parisian
world, went on the same as before, as, for the matter of that,
did every other world.
At that best of all possible restaurants, Noël PETERS, where,
for many years past, when visiting Paris, have we invariably
| dined as frequently as possible, and recommended others to do
likewise, was aught to be heard of any Dreyfus discussion ?
Not one word. We“ did get a-talking" about a tourniquet as
applied to a canard sauvage (an excellent dish, known to most
of us, no doubt); but this is the only “ canard” we heard of,
and that, as you see, wasn't about DREYFUS. This wild duck is
something to look forward to, as it will not be ready for us
until November, at which date we have a special appointment

“ The lion is a horrid bore,
He wants to wallow in your gore.”
SIR, our acknowledgments are due
For lion sent to local Zoo.
He reached us safely, as advised,
Looking a little over-sized'.
To judge from what he went and ate
His teeth were in a healthy state.
He lifted up his nasty paw
And tried to bolt the keeper, raw.
We do not wish to seem ungrateful,
But this was much too large a plateful.
Also the noise he raised at night
Made Mrs. KR-G-R ill with fright.
And when we sang our breakfast-hymn
Our voices sounded strangely dim.
Alas! the trumpet-tones of Žion
Are poor beside a peevish lion.
We advertised, without avail,
For somebody to twist his tail.
No Daniel-burgher could I bring
Even to tread upon the thing.
Yet lions always make them scoff,
Though that is when they're further off.
Myself I would not do the deed
Because it went against my creed.
All carnal pleasures, like the Zoo,
My conscience bids me count taboo.
Besides, as I have said before,
I never was a man of gore.
So when I saw my Dutch collapse
Beyond the saving help of schnapps ;
When even hoary cornets trembled,
I thought it time the Raad assembled :
I also wished to state again
My views on Mr. CHAMBERLAIN ;
And read, to bring them up to date, a
Small batch of mutual ultimata.
They met: before the Civil Power
I laid the question of the hour.
This settled, I should then be happy
To place J. C. upon the tapis ;
But till we fixed the lion's fate
I thought that CHAMBERLAIN could wait.
All day, and rather more than that,
In secret session there they sat.
For fifteen hours they held dispute
How to eliminate the brute.
One Member, relatively placid,
Proposed a course of prussic acid.
Another thought it looked a trifle
More sportsmanlike to use a rifle.
He deemed that he could kill him dead
By putting bullets through his head.
At this a fearful laughter fell:
From such as knew their Mauser well.
Of German build, and that the worst,
They knew the piece was bound to burst.
As Chairman I could not endorse
A scheme of death by guile or force.
The lion's rude decease might well, I
Foresaw, be made a casus belli.
Of course the gift in every sense
Betrayed a gross impertinence.
Yet ought we in a sudden wrath
To turn the lion into broth ?
So far our cause was fairly strong,
But this would place us in the wrong ;
Might lose us friends and cut off short
All but the Chronicle's support.

failed to over-burden Lord SELBORNE's plough with an additional
hand, the last on the list being Sir M. W. RIDLEY, the Home
Secretary, who put a tardy but willing hand to it last week in
a speech at Blackpool. Lord SELBORNE's heart must swell with
pride as he contemplates his achievement, and notes the ever-
growing number of his plagiarists. Even Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
Lord SELBORNE's chief, has not disdained this new departure.
This horny-handed toiler and spinner has been ploughing away
with all the rest-which shows what a wonderful man Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN is, for he has got an hour-glass of his own, and, as
he has had to turn it over a good many times lately, I should not
have supposed he would have been able to spare a hand for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A Corner of the West (HUTCHINSON) is a
work of uneven merit. Miss EDITH FOWLER
(not to be confounded with, or extinguished
by, her little sister who, of late, startled
the world by writing Concerning Isabel
Carnaby) has exceedingly keen insight into
the ways of man and woman, especially of
woman. She sketches with great skill and
in exquisite phrases the littleness of society
life in London. Far away the most brilliant
chapter in the book is the one entitled,
“The Rest of the Season," where are
brought together the pure-hearted, high-
minded girl, Alison—"a girl of light and
shades," some one happily describes her-
and the London butterfly, Sylvia Desmond.
The worst of it is that before this
passage is reached the reader has to yawn
through some acres of padding. The friend
EDITH wanted at her side when the MS.
was finished, was an able-bodied person
with a stout blue pencil, ruthlessly passing
over scores of pages concerning school
treats in the country, picnics, and post-
men's premature deaths. These are very
well in their way; would have made pretty
papers for mild magazines. But they are
not in any sense of the word “novel.”
Whilst the blue pencil was at work, my
Baronite is sure it would have removed a
minor but depressing defect. On every
third or fourth page we find the conversa-
tion broken up by the remark, “JIM
CAREY smiled," " ALISON laughed,” or
“ Lady MERRIVALE laughed.” Once by
way of welcome change, “ ALISON and the
Doctor laughed.” The trick is made more
irritating by the fact that the communi-
cation has a line all to itself. If EDITH
HENRIETTA will take a copy of the book in
hand and run her pen through these insect
lines, she will be surprised to find how
absolutely unnecessary they are to the
progress of the story.

liked, and that ship-money wasn't perfectly lawful.
And as for OLIVER CROMWELL, you would have been down on

. And, earnest as would have been your affection for JAMES, and
your denunciation of NOLL on his
Treatment of CHARLES, more earnest still would have been
your virulence against the American Colonies.
You'd have raved yourself blue in the face with verse, and

Never a street, nor a road, but is crowded
by old fogies stepping off the foot path, all

it's “Scorcher !” he gets thrown at him,

until they are in the mud, and then-Oh,

Even Sir THOMAS shook off his day-by-day

“Why," he asked, " are we like Twelfth

“Because, bedad," he observed, with a

A burst of cheering followed this plea-

hearty welcome to the pioneer of these papers, my Baronite took
exception to the quite unnecessary, and therefore almost criminal,
use in the title of a French word that has no creditable acceptance
even in its own country. “In a Surrey Garden" is not only
sufficient for labelling purposes, but is pretty withal. Mrs.
EARLE admits that “it is sad to have to repeat the un-English
name," and forthwith repeats it, a quaintness sufficient of itself
to declare her sex. Apart from this perversity, the second
volume has all the charm of the first. It is just the friendly

THE WICKED UNCLE IN THE HAYMARKET.
At Her Majesty's, with his superb revival of King John, Mr.
BEERBOHM TREE has achieved the biggest success of his present
management. I should imagine that there never has been, even
during the régime of CHARLES KEAN at the Princess's, so perfect Mie diriggs
a setting given to this series of scenes which place before us
W Robes
the history of the period in dramatic action. Such a spectacle
so pleases Lords, Commons, and the gods above, that if every
night the appearance of the house is the same as it was when
we were present, then Mr. TREE must be having perpetual
“ bumpers.” Out of this vast crowd not a soul stirs until the
curtain descends on the last patriotic speech of Faulconbridge
over the dead body of King John.
Magnificent are the costumes, and splendid the suits of bur-
nished armour that dazzle our eyes in camp and court, and it is
quite in keeping with what SCOTT has told us of Isaac of York, who
could supply a Knight Templar's complete outfit, sword included,
at shortest notice, that the armourers to the court of King John
should be (as is stated in the bill) “Messrs. L. & H. NATHAN."
Rough, rugged, and conscious of his own dramatic force and
skill in fence is the Philip Faulconbridge of Mr. LEWIS WALLER;
while the madness of Constance, as pourtrayed by Miss JULIA
NEILSON, powerfully enlists the sympathies of all the anti-
Johnnies in the audience.
Carefully studied is every detail of Mr. TREE'S business'
in the scene where King John gains over to his evil purpose the
ill-favoured, soft-hearted, emotional Hubert, capitally played
by Mr. FRANKLIN MCLEAY, and engages him for the post of
Prince Arthur's private executioner. How much easier it would
have been to have killed little Arthur outright than to have
commenced his compassed death by putting out his eyes with
red-hot irons! Yet, had this roundabout method not been
adopted, the pathetic scene between Arthur (Master CHARLES
SEFTON) and Hubert would never have occurred to the “Divine
WILLIAMS," and the Drama would have been the poorer.
Well chosen is Miss BATEMAN as the representative of the
cruel, selfish, and ambitious mother of King John, who, as

Outside, we would suggest that the service for fetching cabs and
carriages is capable of considerable improvement. The system,
which I believe works well elsewhere, of giving a numbered
ticket to the coachman and also to the occupant of the carriage,
has not yet been tried at Her Majesty's. But that's another
story, and as to the play, though King John be full of the clash
of arms and war's alarms, yet Mr. TREE may well congratulate
himself on having obtained a “lasting piece."

ANGLO-AMERICAN.—Yes, we believe it is quite true that when,
during his recent reception at New York, a man in the crowd
called out, “Are you any relation to Dewey Eve?" the
Admiral promptly replied, “Some. She was my first mother."
As you say, the humour of the querist is a little thin. But it
gave Admiral DEWEY an opportunity of showing that he is as
ready on land as he was prompt at sea. No; we do not see
any reason to believe that the incident was pre-arranged by
the Committee.

TA
ARTFUL AND CRAFTY.
MY DEAR EDITOR,— When you were kind
enough to allow me to visit the New
Gallery to see the excellent contents of
the Arts and Crafts Exhibition, I was
slightly nervous, as the commission was
what may be termed "a large order."
The Society holds its show once in three
years, and naturally the preparations must
be of far-reaching character. However, I
was somewhat reassured when, in exchange
for my iicket, I was courteously handed a
catalogue.
The first exhibit that attracted my
attention was a fountain, but on referring
to my guide-book I could not discover its
number. Then I saw some most comfort-
able seats (occupied by weary sightseers),
but these again were uncatalogued. I
accounted for these seeming omissions by
the fact that my volume was said to be
“ under revision." It is only right to say
that the fountain appeared to me to be a
fixture, and my impression is strengthened
by a faint recollection of having seen the
exhibit in the same place on other occa-
sions.
On glancing at the catalogue, I was much
struck by the evident utilitarian spirit in
which those responsible for the collection
had undertaken what must have been at
once a duty and a labour of love. Here
was a “Tea-cosy," there a cushion-
square. I was much pleased with the
designs for the various costumes in the
Art Workers Guild Masque. “Hope” was
extremely good, and “Smell”-if I may
venture on an opinion — even better.
Then I came upon suggestions for stained-
glass windows, and finding that most of
the exhibits were on sale, thought of pur-
chasing one of the designs for myself. I
was induced to take this course of action
into consideration, as I feel that I had
better put up a window to myself during
my lifetime as there might be some hesi-
tation in paying me the graceful compli-
ment when circumstances over which I

THE HIGHLAND GAMES AT MACJIGGITY.
WHILST staying at MacFoozle Castle, my excellent host
insisted that I should accompany him to see the Highland Games.
The MacFOOZLE himself is a typical Hielander, and appeared
in a kilt and jelly-bag-philabeg, I mean. Suggested to him
that I should go, attired in pair of bathing-drawers, Norfolk
jacket, and Glengarry cap, but he, for some inscrutable reason
of his own, negatived the idea. Had half a mind to dress in
kilt myself, but finally decided against the national costume as
being too draughty. Arrived on ground, and found that “toss-
ing the caber" was in full progress. Braw laddies struggled,
in turn, with enormous tree trunk. The idea of the contest
is, that whoever succeeds in killing the greatest number of
spectators by hurling the tree on to them, wins the prize. Fancy
these laddies had been hung too long, or else they were par-
ticularly braw. Moved up to windward of them promptly.
“Who is the truculent-looking villain with red whiskers ?"
I ask.
“Hush !” says my host, in awed tones. “That is the MAC-
GINGER himself!”.
I grovel. Not that I have ever even heard his name before,
but I don't want to show my ignorance before the MacFOOZLE.
The competition of pipers was next in order, and I took to my
heels and fled. Rejoined MacFOOZLE half an hour later to
witness the dancing. On a large raised platform sat the
judges, with the mighty MACGINGER himself at their head.
Can't quite make out whether the dance is a Reel, a Strathspey,
a Haggis, or a Skirl-sure it is one or the other. Just as I ask
for information, amid a confusing whirl of arms and legs and
“ Hoots !” a terrific crack is heard, and the platform, as though
protesting at the indignities heaped upon it, suddenly gives
way, and in a moment, dancers, pipers, and judges are hurled in
a confused and struggling heap to the ground. The MACGINGER
falls upon some bag-pipes, which emit dismal groanings beneath
his massive weight. This ends the dancing prematurely, and a
notice is immediately put up all round the grounds that (to take
its place) “ There will be another competition of bag-pipes.” 1

freedom, his Birmingham statesmen, his loud, strong voice—all
the qualities, in fact, that make JOHN BULL superior to the
beggarly remnant of humanity, whose ignorance he pities, and
whom he proposes to go on despising.
It appears, however, that Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN has been pained
to the inmost recesses of his sensitive being by the unfavour-
able comments of some of our German friends. ALFRED is a
Laureate; he occupies an official position; he knows all about
the Royal Family, whose domestic incidents are supposed to
provide him with perpetual inspiration; he is on easy terms
with Dukes and Cabinet Ministers; he knows how things are
done; he keeps watch and ward over the British Empire, and not
even a German shall presume to criticise that Empire without
laying himself open to pretty nearly a full printed column, not
of poetry, to be sure, since even ALFRED tempers a just severity
with a merciful consideration for a foeman's feelings, but
of solid, self-laudatory, argumentative prose from ALFRED'S
temporarily depoetised pen.
But how blessed, how touching is the modesty of our ALFRED !
His German correspondent had spoken of ALFRED as one who
had “the double capacity of statesman and poet.” ALFRED puts
all this by; he will have none of it; he cannot, he says, “in the
| least agree with what you much too partially say in your letter."
Not a statesman, he seems to murmur in a sweet and blushing
confusion, only a leader-writer on the Standard, better informed,
it may be, than most statesmen, but let that pass; not a poet,
oh no, only a writer of sonnets, odes, ballads, and dramatic
pieces, which for fire and force, and real afflatus—but, tush, I
must dissemble. However, of course, ALFRED knew that this
letter of his was going to be printed in the Times, and no doubt
he thought it a pity that certain carpers should not have the
chance of knowing what a real critic (though a German) thought
of ALFRED; and so, equally of course, ALFRED included this
particular quotation about the “double capacity of statesman
and poet" in his reply, and sent it off to the Times.
But what beats me about the whole business is the fearful, if
unconscious, criticism which this correspondence passes upon us,
ALFRED's fellow-countrymen. Not one of us would have dreamed
of thinking or writing of ALFRED as either a statesman or a
poet, let alone statesman and poet in combination, so deeply
immersed are we in the trivial materialities of life. It is left for

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The P. and 0. Pocket Book is a small volume on a great theme.
It sets forth the history, and throws light on the domestic
economy, of a commercial fleet of which the Empire may well be
proud. Incidentally it supplies in a nutshell much valuable
information for voyagers. There are excellent maps, many
picturesque photogravures of ships and ports, and a supplement
of blank sheets for private notes. Half a dozen descriptive
articles deal with the various countries between which the
palatial P. and 0. liners pass to and fro, shuttles on the loom of
the world. Thus STANLEY LANE-POOLE writes on Egypt, Sir
EDWIN ARNOLD on India, Sir THOMAS WADE on China, and HENRY
W. LUCY on Japan. Far away the most interesting contribution
is that wherein Sir THOMAS SUTHERLAND, Chairman of the
Company, relates its history. As he has practically made it
during the prosperous epoch of the last twenty-five years, he is
well qualified for the task. The first ship owned by the P. and 0.
Company was the William Fawcett, built in 1829, of 206 gross
tonnage; the last is the Persia, whose structure of 8,000 tons is
now approaching completion on the stocks. Between the
launching of these two vessels there lies a field of achievement
possible only to dauntless courage, tireless patience, infinite
resources of mind and money. There are few cases (there is a
parallel in the White Star Line) wherein, with full acknowledg-
ment made to capable and loyal colleagues, the success of a
vast enterprise is so directly traceable to an individual, as by
common consent it is with the Peninsular and Oriental Company.
The Chairman has his most cherished reward in the prosperity
of the concern of which, for nearly a quarter of a century, his
has been the guiding hand. There is one delicate little fashion
in which his colleagues on the Board might give expression to
the esteem and admiration they in common with the staff and
officers are not slow to express in private conversation. They
should christen the next new ship Lady Sutherland.

the author allowed one person instead of six to tell the story,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday Night,
October 17.-PRINCE ARTHUR never so
charming in manner as when accident of
his position leads him to disclaim per-
sonal knowledge of questionable things.
Example forthcoming to-night. CAWMELL-
BANNERMAN, in debate on Address in
reply to Speech from Throne, began by
uncompromisingly ranging himself on side
of Government in resisting Boer invasion
of British Colonies. Enthusiastic cheering
from Ministerialists reminded him what
would be expected by section of his own
following. As the member for SARK says,
finger of Providence plainly visible in
selecting for Leader of Liberal Opposition
as at present constituted a gentleman
with double-barrelled name. CAWMELL
having patted Ministers on the back,
BANNERMAN, coming up in front, lands his
right fist in unpleasant propinquity to
their unresponsive countenance. So, as
in the concluding scene of Box and Cox,
"every one is satisfied.”.
To-night, having declared that it is
“the plain duty of us all” to resist the
invading Boer, Č.-B. went on to accuse the
Government of bluffing.
"Bluffing? What's bluffing?" PRINCE
ARTHUR whispered to Don JOSÉ, seated on
his left.
"Oh," said Colonial Secretary, “it's
something to do with a game of cards.
Poker, I think. Consult the Attorney-
General. That's what he's here for, you
know."
“What's poker?” PRINCE ARTHUR
asked, turning towards the Attorney-
General seated at the other side.
“Pokare?” said Sir RICHARD, whose
long residence in Paris in connection with |
the Venezuelan case has distinctly affected
his accent. “It is a domestic implement.
Tisonnier we call it in Paris, sometimes
fourgon."
“Tut!” said PRINCE ARTHUR impa-
tiently.
BANNERMAN EXHORTETA CAMPBELL.
: Fortunately, addressing inquiry to
Friend Bannerman (of the Antagonist's Protection Society). “Oh-h-h! my dear friend, beware of
eminent authority, he leaned across unseemly teruculence. Be not, I beseech you, led astray from the paths of Peace."

armed at all points.
“Never know what sudden call may not
be made upon you, dear TOBY," he once
said. “My motto is, 'Be ready.' So
never miss opportunity of picking up bits
of information, however out of the way.”
Rule now stood him in good stead. Able
to explain to his chief all about poker,
supplying him with what proved most
effective point in admirable debating
speech.
" What is bluffing?" PRINCE ARTHUR
said, when his turn came to reply to
CAWMELL - BANNERMAN. “I understand,"
he shyly continued, deprecatingly rubbing
his hands and hanging his head, “it is
connected with a game of cards-of which
I have no personal knowledge—and so
used indicates that the person having no
useful cards in his hands acts as if he
possessed them."
That was a mild paraphrase of GEORGE

in a war their ex-Solicitor-General de-
nounced as “a crime against civilisation."
For three hours less twenty minutes DON
JOSÉ spoke. The time does not accurately
describe the flood of words poured forth.
When he had finished the personal
encounters, through the heat of which he
imposed on himself restraint of utter-
ance, his delivery far exceeded the
average speed.
As a mere physical effort it was a marvel.
Unlike the ordinary speaker with half an
hour before him, DON JOSÉ had not made
provision even of a glass of water. An
intricate case of vital national inter-
est, it would tax the resources of a
supremely able man to set it forth clearly
and convincingly in an ordered speech
free from the embarrassment of interrup-
tion. DON JOSÉ with his back to the wall
was fighting subject to constant surprises.
Interruption burst forth from all quarters,
sometimes in chorus. He might have
ignored it, and gone on with a speech
whose course was indicated by the notes
held in his hand. On the contrary, he
joyously stepped forward to deal with
successive assailants. No one touched his
shield with angry lance without drawing
on himself a stroke of the glittering rapier.
All the while, returning time after time
one of these sorties, he patiently, effec-
tively elaborated his plan of defence.

but, if such were ever the case, thank goodness he changed his
mind, and was sufficiently fortunate not to find a composer, as,
if he had, we should have lost in “words for songs ” most of
the satirical dialogue that indeed goes a great way towards
the making of the piece.
Mr. ERIC LEWIS, as Louis the Seventh of Arcacia, is admirable,
as are all the royal personages, Mrs. CHARLES CALVERT as the
Queen Dowager, Miss ADA BRANSON as his pleasant-looking,
easy-going queen, Master REGINALD DENNY as the very youthful
heir apparent, aged about eight (quite a first-class boy in the
school of dramatic art), and Miss GERTRUDE ELLIOTT as the
delightful Princess, only daughter of King Louis.
The whimsical satire upon the monotonous routine of court
existence in the very limited Monarchy of Arcacia, uncommonly
like that of many other monarchies of greater extent, is simply
excellent. The author evidently knows “ the ropes," and his
imagination exercises itself on a very solid foundation of fact.
All the characters, with the exception of the melancholy Father
Anselm (carefully rendered by Mr. MARSH ALLEN), are conceived
in the vein of true comedy. A more courtly ecclesiastic than
Mr. DION BOUCICAULT's Cardinal Archbishop of Caron it would be
difficult to find. Why he is always studying a big book it is
difficult to discover: it isn't his breviary, that's evident;
neither is it a time table, nor a dictionary. This is the only
unreality about the Cardinal, who otherwise is a far more true
type of the genuine article than was BULWER'S theatrical
Richelieu or any other waxwork stage figure of a Cardinal,
Wolsey excepted. He is a courtier, he is a politician, and
he is very human. He wears a curious sort of ring, which
is not Cardinalesque, and, by the way, Father Anselm also
wears a ring, which no ordinary ecclesiastic ever does. But this
is a trifling detail only noticeable where all else is so perfect.
Mr. JAMES ERSKINE plays the Duke of Berascon, Equerry in
Ordinary, to the very life: it could not be bettered in any other
hands. Excellent, too, is the make up of Mr. AUBREY FITZ-
GERALD as the Chief Commissioner of Police, though the part is
rather over-acted. General Casella, who is a Verges to Chief
Commissioner Dogberry, is also good. Mr. PAUL ARTHUR'S

Yours, Sir, thank Heaven, is not the temper in which our

with a death-despising courage against a hail of lead; they
offer the sacrifice of their lives in order that, high and low
alike, they may carry out their orders and do their duty to the
end. Brave men themselves, they recognise, they admire the
courage of their foes, and when the heights have been won, and
darkness comes down upon the ghastly work of lead and steel,
they will succour their wounded foes no less readily because of
KIPLING'S nursery jingle or SWINBURNE'S disgusting sonnet.

(V. “A Legal Tender," Punch, Oct. 25.)
I READ my Punch on Wednesday, and
I recognised the sender
Whose very tender legal hand
Had penned A Legal Tender.
I've thought the matter over well,
And now, Sir, as thou biddest,
My judgment I proceed to tell,
Which is as follows, id est-
Your prospects are not, I regret,
What prospects ought to be, Sir;
The only silk you'll ever get
Will be a dress for me, Sir;
The case of cham. that used to grace
Your rooms in dear old New, Sir,
Is just about the only case
Will opened be by you, Sir.
Such being your position, it
Will very likely strike you
As odd of me if I admit
That I do rather like you.
The tender tender which you penned
I do not quite decline, Šir;
Give me your heart and I will send

THE MILLIONAIRE BUSINESS.
["Max NORDAU has been giving some advice
on how to become a millionaire. ... It is not such
a difficult matter after all. He must possess the
instinct of a beast of prey-nothing higher."
Westminster Gazette.]
THERE is money in the bowels of the earth,
There is money in the water and the air,
And you've merely got to make it
In sufficiency, I take it,
To become an independent millionaire.
If you 'll only give attention
To the points that I will mention,
It is easy to become a millionaire.
Think of money, money, money, day and
night,
Be your dreams of money-market, stock
and share,
You must never let your fancies
Wander far from your finances
If you ever hope to be a millionaire ;
For ideals are quixotic,
And are simply idiotic
In a man who wants to be a millionaire.
If you have a bogus business on your hands,
Noble profits may be made of it, with care,
For I've got a little notion
That in company promotion
Lies the secret to become a millionaire.
Other folk must bear your crosses
In the shape of money losses
If you'd be a bonâ fide millionaire.
The widow and the orphan, what are they?
Do not listen to the working-man's despair.
If you only get their savings,
Do you think their little ravings
Will be able to affect a millionaire ?
Do you dream that such a trifle
As another's starving wife'll
Inconvenience a well-fed millionaire?
No, I haven't tried the trick as yet myself
For I question if it's altogether fair,
But no doubt were I inclined to
Turn the forces of my mind to
It, I'd very soon become a millionaire.
As explained to you already
It is very simple-crede
Inexperto-to become a millionaire.

To write like him, you twig, 's my latest boom,

actress done in her time, and never was JEFFERSON'S Rip Van

tried wife than when Mrs. BILLINGTON, the present bénéficiaire,
played the part. Long was her name associated with those of
our leading actors, and rarely was “JOHNNIE" TOOLE better
seconded than when Mrs. BILLINGTON gave“ more power to his

Theatre, on the afternoon of November 28, will be a bumper,
and that the clever actress may long live to enjoy the fruits of
her professional labours, the company of her many friends, and
the esteem of the theatre-going public. The box-office at the

MR. JOHN ASHTON, who has thrown much light on the
picturesque byeways of social life in the reign of Queen ANNE,
supplements it by a series of thumb-nail sketches of Social
England Under the Regency (CHATTO AND WINDUS). The plan of
compilation is simple and effective. Mr. ASHTON hunts up the
newspapers, pamphlets, and squibs of the period, snips out
the spicy bits, and connects them by a rapid narrative. The
letterpress is illustrated by nearly a hundred sketches, being
reproductions of contemporary popular art. There is, of course,
a good deal of chat about the Regent, including the account of
his installation, and his solemn oath “ in all things to consult
and maintain the safety, honour, and dignity of His Majesty,
and the welfare of his people." It is pleasing to know that
“ during the ceremony His Royal Highness maintained the most
graceful and dignified deportment." Still preserving this,

the supposed traitor, to conciliate the audience which is never
very amicably disposed towards a representative of the Royal
Dutchman, and who has to win every one over to his side by
uttering a kindly sentiment, always through his hooked nose,
doing an act of cheap but effective generosity utterly impossible
without that remarkable nose, and, finally, by uniting the lovers

not only gartered, but also blue-blooded and belted.
Well, PRIMROSE, you've spoken ; your foot's down at last,
and it's all over with everybody else, because, of course, when
you tell us what's what, it is naturally even more than equivalent
to finality;
And there never was an occasion when things were more final
than they were the other day when you addressed the popula-
tion of Bath, and the mayor and the municipality.
You talked about the war, of course, and on the whole you
led us to suppose that you were glad of it and thought it was a
splendid and glorious war, and that because Mr. KRÜGER gave
us a knock at Majuba we were bound to send out about a
hundred thousand soldiers to give him and his thirty thousand
farmers a knock back,
One of our chief causes for fighting him and smashing his
people into smithereens being that he and his nation had
endeavoured, so you told us, to put the hands of the clock back.
And then, having discussed these and other polemical matters,
you implored the rest of us not to waste time in polemical
discussion,
Seeing that ours was a lonely little island floating in these
northern seas (there wasn't anything particularly touching in
all that, was there? Most islands have a way of being more or
less lonely, and if they don't float, down they go and cease to
be islands or anything else), and that we were viewed with
jealousy by every surrounding nation, the French, the German,
and (I 'm coming to the end of the line at last) the Russian.
And then, after giving vent to these tremendous and all but
revolutionary sentiments, which you had, of course, every
reason to believe were shockingly distasteful to your audience,
to the Times, and the Daily News, and the rest of the Jingo
newspapers, to the Music Halls, to the Stock Exchange, to
warlike aldermen, and the crowds that have been raving as if
they had lost their senses-
After incurring all this animosity, you raised your arms with
a noble gesture of self-sacrificing defiance, and said you didn't
care a jot (what a grand, brave fellow you are!) if the doctrine

Bri
At the Criterion.-Hicks-cessively funny. My Daughter-in-
Law, the rendering in English of MM. CARRÉ and BILHALD'S
Ma Bru, is now in the fifth week of its run and going un-
commonly strong, judging from the full house and the ap-
plause and laughter with which throughout it is received. It
has not much of a plot, and what there is of it is not particularly
novel, but the situations throughout two acts are good, the fun
never flags until the last act; and above all it is admirably
acted by every one. Of course, as so much in the first two acts
is made of the intended rendezvous of Mr. Mainwaring, Senior,
M.P., in which character Mr. HERBERT STANDING is capital,
with the Countess, Miss CYNTHIA BROOKE, it is disappointing to
the expectant audience only to hear a report and see the result
of that interview, when the scene of the interview itself would
have presented so many varied farcical complications.
Miss ELLALINE TERRISS is delightful as Ma Bru at open
warfare with her mother-in-law, Mrs. Mainwaring, most
emphatically rendered with all her strong comedy force by
Miss FANNY BROUGH. “Ma Bru s'en va-t-en guerre" against
her Belle-maman, and the latter gets the worst of it.
Mr. SEYMOUR Hicks is an amusing representative of a young
married man, who is his wife's and mother's darling, and for
whom both are fighting. Mr. ALFRED BISHOP, admirably made
up, gives us one of his best bits of character as an elderly
gentleman who can't help “dropping into” bad language. He
played something like it before in Rosemary.
The funniest scene is where a deaf musician, Mr. LITTLE, is
told to play the piano, and then the guests throw things at him
because they can't hear themselves talk. Mr. VANE-TEMPEST
should protest against the utterly idiotic business of going on
hands and knees to find his pince-nez, which, of course, he still

by applying it only to its performance last Tuesday night; and
even then, as several numbers were omitted from the published
book, and one at least introduced which was not to be found ;
therein, the piece may be considered as “a progressive;" and
a GEORGE EDWARDES piece knows no such word as “ fail.”
Tenor HAYDEN COFFIN has hardly anything to do except to
look clean and nice as the spotless Captain Bobby Preston, and
to saunter about, singing an occasional ditty, and joining in a
duet or concerted piece, as the case may be. Miss MARIE
TEMPEST, to whom Tenor HAYDEN has to play the perfunctory
lover, hasn't even the chance of looking her best either as a
Chinese boy or Chinese girl. No doubt their musical and
dramatic opportunities will arrive in time.
The success of the piece, for the crammed house is evidence
of this, is made, in the first place, by Mr. RUTLAND BARRING-
TOX, who, as the Mandarin with his six little wives, all
playing up to him splendidly, is simply inimitable. His wink
is a wonder. In that irresistible wink are all the hearty
encores that, on every occasion when he opens his mouth and
shuts his eye, he obtains for himself and the dainty little
ladies of his harem. Then Mr. HUNTLEY WRIGHT, as Li, admirably
sustains the reputation he made in the Geisha : it is a similar
character, and largely does he contribute to the popularity of the
concerted song and dance, six times encored, the burden of
which, “ For we all of us are going back to London," is borne
lightly by indefatigable and clever Miss HILDA MOODY, Miss
GRACIE LEIGH, and the pretty “English ladies" all in a row,
and lastly, but not leastly, by Mr. LIONEL MACKINDER, as a
smart young officer, and the eccentric Mr. FRED KAYE, with his
wonderful waddle, his comical face, and his abrupt Jingle-like
style of speaking.
There is just the least possible suspicion of a plot somewhere
about, the secret of which is in the possession of Mr. RUTLAND
BARRINGTON and Mr. BARKER, the clever stage manager, to
whom largely the success is due, but, as Mr. Toots might have

AT POTSDAM,
ALL the newspapers of the world have
endeavoured to guess the subjects dis-
cussed by the two Emperors during their
afternoon drive in the Park at Potsdam.
In one respect only all the newspapers
agree. The Emperor WILLIAM and the
Emperor NICHOLAS must have debated the
political affairs of the whole earth. We
alone are enabled to give the following
report, from a source which we are not at
liberty to reveal :-
N. C'est dommage que je parle alle-
mand si mal.
W. Du tout, du tout! Vous parlez très

questions-là ! Eh bien, c'est leur métier.
Et MURAVIEFF, qu'est-ce qu'il dit de

N. Tiens ! C'est presque la politique,

W. Ah, voyons donc ! C'est absolument

could have allowed such a pro-Boer article to appear in your columns I
cannot imagine, and there are many others who are as disgusted as I am. As
for your almost weekly attacks upon ALFRED AUSTIN, they are cruel and
caddish. All poets are of a highly-strung and sensitive nature, and feel pin-
pricks more than ordinary mortals, and you should also bear in mind that,
whether Mr. AUSTIx ranks high or low in the art of poesy, he holds his
appointment of Poet Laureate from Her Majesty the Queen."
There, Sir, you have it. Because a human being has been
converted into an official and has had his appointment signed by
Her Majesty the QUEEN, all criticism of his acts is to cease! Sir
ALFRED MILNER is a High Commissioner : down, therefore, on
your knees, oh ye people, and receive in humility the divine
rhetoric of Sir ALFRED. Mr. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN is a Secretary
of State : therefore his actions are just and straightforward,
and his words are the words of wisdom—with only this qualifica-
tion, that what Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said three or four years ago
either doesn't matter, or is to be interpreted in a sense
precisely opposite to that which it seemed to plain men to be
intended to convey. The Earl of SELBORNE, that famous Colonel
of Militia, is an Under-Secretary: may Heaven, therefore, pro-
tect him and bring the common herd to acknowledge the verbal
inspiration of every speech made by the noble, plough-handling,
Colonial Under-Secretary. That is the simple-minded idea that
is at the root of the letter I have quoted (it is dated from
Walmer, Kent, and is signed, “ A SOLDIER AND A MAN'); it is
the idea that is responsible for nearly all the brag and the
baseless charges of our stay-at-home warriors, and it is an idea,
finally, against which every man who claims to exercise his
reason and values his right to the free expression of his opinion
is bound to protest. At any rate, we are not disposed to grant
an immunity from criticism to men who share with us a liability
to error, and whose conduct seems to stamp them as even more
foolish than ourselves. Let me put it to “A SOLDIER AND A
MAN" in this way: did he ever in the course of his long,
Punch-reading life exempt Mr. GLADSTONE from criticism ? Did
he ever complain when others criticised him? I trow not. And
yet Mr. GLADSTONE was appointed by Her Majesty the QUEEN to
the various offices in which, according to many soldiers and
many men, he wrought irreparable mischief to his country. Or

by an old witch-doctor. The tallest of
them has now reached a height of 259 feet
7 inches, and the fruit it bears exactly
resembles cheddar cheese in taste and

characterise every stroke of these charming sketches. It would
be altogether unfair to say that the author owes his inspiration
to Mr. KIPLING. He speaks from long and close experience;
and, what is better still, his note is his own. He never loses
the colour-harmony of the forest.
“A turn, and we stand in the heart of things;
The woods are round us, heaped and dim."
Against every temptation to impose with purple patches, he
stands firm with a fine reserve of strength. Whether Mr. Doyle
would be capable of compassing a broader theme it is, perhaps,
idle to conjecture. A touch or two in his treatment of a
familiar human episode, half tragedy, half comedy, seems to
betray a consciousness of his limits. But in the particular
sphere to which he mainly devotes himself, it is difficult to
detect an error of judgment or style, unless it be urged against
mim that the conclusions of some of his stories incline to
abruptness. In a brilliant illustration by Mr. NETTLESHIP, full
of fire and movement, the beasts of the jungle are seen careering
across the back of the book. The covers, in fact, have been

a novel by the author of Behind a Mask, and Iras, a Mystery.
He has been greatly interested in the book, which reminds him
not a little of The Memoirs of a Physician, by the first DUMAS,
and other works having to do with hypnotism. As to the plot,
the Baron's Retainer might as well say that, acting as a hunts-
man, Mr. THEO. DOUGLAS first catches his fox, and then puts his
readers off the scent until he runs his prize to earth in the last
chapter. A Legacy of Hate, like some other popular modern
romances, appears to have been written backwards. Taken as
a tale, A Legacy of Hate is above the average. The Baron's
Retainer says that he intends to recommend it to his friends
rather than to his foes.

ON LYRIC LINES.
As far as bright costumes, neat ankles, pretty faces, brisk and
cleverly-executed dances, sharply - up-to-date - written and
pointedly-given verses, can help towards insuring success,
Florodora at the Lyric can rank with its rivals on the above
lines, past and present.
That the writer, who rather cynically debits himself as
“ OWEN HALL,” should not gain any great amount of credit for
his “book,” is possible, seeing that the dialogue is common-
place, and there is very little • plot.” Where would plot and
dialogue have been but for the “ lyrics" written by Messrs.
BOYD JONES and RUBENS ? The music by Mr. LESLIE STUART
starts at the opening of the first act with a tuneful vigour that
promises what unfortunately it never succeeds in performing.
Such songs as obtain encores, and there are several, owe
their success to the words and the singing, as in the case of
Miss ADA REEVE's song of “Tact," and KATE CUTLER's whistling
song; while the encores gained by the dances, especially where
the girls and boys come out to play together, for no ostensible
reason except that there 's nothing else of any interest going
on at the moment, are due rather to the neatly-executed steps
and spirited style of the dancers, than to any distinct touch of
novelty in the music.
Mr. WILLIE EDOUIN is immensely funny in his grotesque
assumption of a character that, whether in the costume of the
first or second act, might have sidled out of an old GEORGE
CRUIKSHANK'S caricature book. Mr. CHARLES STEVENS, with
song and dance and chorus, is “one of the best"; and the acting
which Miss EVIE GREENE throws into the part of Dolores suggests
that, if ever an English Carmen be required, here is the very
actress for the rôle.
There is hardly anything striking, musically or dramatically,
for the small tenor lover, represented by Mr. EDGAR STEVENS,
nor for the beloved burly baritone, Mr. MELVILLE STEWART.
What an opening this Music-Owen-Hallish Opera offers to pre-
sentable young men capable of singing and dancing, who might
otherwise be do-nothings by day and dull wall-flowers by night!
Why, one theatrical engagement of this sort should be worth
five times the salary of an ordinary Government clerk; and then
dancing and singing lessons, with charming partners, are in-
cluded. But this is going away from Florodora, which you
won't till eleven has struck, and then off you 'll go, as piquante

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
To those familiar with the work and position of MILLAIS
during the last quarter of a century of his life, it is difficult to
believe there was a period when he was crushed under the
influence of a dead set made against him by influential leaders
of opinion in the art world. The discovery is made in the
Life and Letters edited by his son JOHN, published in two
massive volumes by METHUEN. That in the year 1859, JOHN
RUSKIN should have changed his early note of admiration for
MILLAIS' work for a howl of venomous contumely is, in the
circumstances, easy to understand. In a letter to his wife,
MILLAIS admits his full understanding of the particular on-
slaught. More bitterly resented was the abuse heaped upon
him by the Times, and what he regarded as the unscrupulous
jealousy of the Royal Academicians. The public crowded round
his pictures on the Academy walls. One was re-hung after a
passionate protest from the outraged painter. But able critics
jeered at him. “In the midst of success," he writes to his wife
on the 10th of April, 1859, “I am dreadfully low-spirited, and
the profession is more hideous than ever in my eyes." This
was the year in which he had three pictures on the line in the
Academy, including the beautiful “Vale of Rest," an especial
target for abuse. It is pleasant for Mr. Punch's young men of
the present generation to know that, according to the biographer,
when “ The Huguenot " was exhibited no paper, except Punch
and the Spectator, showed a glimmer of comprehension of its
pathos and its beauty, or foresaw the hold it eventually obtained
on the heart of the people. Punch was always dear to MILLAIS.
His letters are fuli of reference to its weekly appearance. Our
DU MAURIER was one of his closest friends, and in this Life
a whole chapter is devoted to the correspondence and com-
panionship of the two artists, both lovable men. After 1860
the tide turned, and with ever increasing speed and force the
world came round to Mr. Punch's opinion of the genius of JOAN
EVERETT MILLAIS. There is much of pathos in MILLAIS's life,
deepening in the black cloud that closed over its end. But on
the whole, my Baronite believes, he had the joyous time of a
sweet-natured, merry-hearted, clean-minded, strenuous worker.
Through the last twenty-five years he came in close personal
contact with most of his foremost contemporaries in literature,
science, arms, and politics. Many, including Mr. GLADSTONE,
sat to him for their portraits. Limned by MILLAIS's pen, as

UNRECORDED HISTORY.—REVIEW OF THE “QUEEN'S OWN SUBURBAN EVERGREENS” BY THE GERMAN EMPEROR.
It will be readily understood that, with the bulk of the British Army otherwise engaged (in “wiping something off a slate"), there is some difficulty in providing His Majesty the GERMAN EMPEROR
with an adequate military display. Our artist would humbly suggest that a March Past of our Military Veterans would be at once fascinating and impressive. West Kensington and the Service Clubs
could be largely drawn upon. (Notice.-German l'ARADE-STEP (gout permitting) for this occasion only.)

I remember many more, but I may safely leave them to the
memory of my readers.
Those who worked with you, your juniors in a case, knew
that if they were to satisfy you they must use their utmost
diligence and their highest skill; but if you were, as you were
right in being, an exacting taskmaster, you were never grudging
in the praise you bestowed on honest and laborious effort, and
praise from you was valued above everything else by those who
had fought at your side, had watched your own zealous and
unremitting warfare, and admired the strength and the cer-
tainty with which you wielded your weapons in the fray.
These thoughts and memories, my Lord, occurred to me the
other day when I read your address to the new LORD MAYOR.
If your juniors at a conference sometimes felt nervous when
they had to face that penetrating eye and listen to those words
of steel with which you were wont to go to the root of a
question, what must have been the feelings of the civic digni-
tary who had proceeded to your Court in his gaudy coach
through streets crowded and beflagged in his honour on the
opening day of his mayoralty?“ROBERT," the City Waiter,
I remember, drew in his Diary a painful picture of an ex-LORI)
MAYOR's emotion. Throughout his year of office he has
banqueted with Princes, Field-Marshals, and celebrities of the
different sorts ; he has been my-lorded by all men, from Cabinet
Ministers down to the well-fed and gorgeously liveried lackeys
whose pride it is to execute swiftly his smallest behests, until,
lo, on the morning of November 10, he wakes to hear his valet
say, “ Your hot water, Sir," in a tone not unmixed with the con-
tempt that pursues potentates who have fallen. Something
like this revulsion of feeling must have afflicted his newly-
inaugurated Lordship the other day: he entered the Court a
full-blown LORD MAYOR, and in a moment, by a pantomimic
change, he became as a schoolboy in the sanctum of an uncom-
promising headmaster. The contrast was as piquant as it
was startling to the turtle-fed retainers who had accompanied
his hitherto triumphal procession.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
FROM the East-end of London to the Desert of Sahara we are
dragged breathless and agape by Mr. MACLAREN COBBAN in his
latest book, An African Treasure (JOHN LONG). Free fights,
darkly insidious plots and counterplots, robberies, captivities,
hairbreadth escapes, alarms and excursions galore. These are
his stock-in-trade, and all who love scenes of turbid adventure
will eagerly submit themselves to him and let him make their
flesh creep with his culminating horrors of the man-eating
octopus, and the veiled lepers. “Tis a real frisson you give us,
Mr. COBBAN," says the Baronitess.
What, more fairy stories? Yes; and this time S. BARING-
GOULD is the author. His little book, entitled The Crock of Gold
(METHUEN & Co.)—which clearly ought to have been The Crock
of Gould-contains no less than twelve delightful fairy tales
of just the right length to suit those for whom the book was
primarily intended.
Most interesting are the odds and ends contained in a volume
entitled Stories from Old-fashioned Children's Books, brought
together and introduced to the reader by ANDREW W. TUER,
F.S.A. (Leadenhall Press). The 250 illustrations, or rather cuts,
are wonderfully quaint, all characteristic of the early days of
our grandfathers and grandmothers, and of their grandparents
before them. Mr. TUER has made a most quaint and interesting
collection, as full of instruction as it is of amusement. It is
indeed " Treasure Trove” both for young and old.
In Ford's Folly, Limited (MACQUEEN), Major ARTHUR GRIFFITHS
gives us an exciting and clearly told story of crime and its
detection. The habitual criminal whose habit of crime fits him
so well, that, though disguising it and hiding it as he will, he
can never discard it, is a character drawn from the very life.
The author treats his villains with a leniency which is some-
what disappointing, but he triumphantly extricates his hero
and heroine from all their difficulties.

I
PLAY
NOTHING BUT SMOKE.
“A PRACTICAL MAN” writes, DEAR
MR. PUNCH, -I know you will sympathise
in the crusade headed by Sir WILLIAM
RICHMOND against the smoke nuisance.
According to experts, the mischief is
attributable to low-level infringers of
the law, rather than to lofty chimneys.
Therefore,
1. Potato-cans and street stoves for the
cooking of chestnuts to be fed with coke
or electricity.
2. Tripods burning coals, and used for
night-watchers over street improvements,
to be abolished, and the workmen to be
supplied with fur-lined gloves and over-
coats at the expense of the L. C. C.
3. All fireplaces in artizans' lodging-
houses and flats to be taken out, and hot-
water pipes to be erected in their stead.
This would be a great boon to the poor
after the original cost had been negotiated.
4. All mansions, houses, and out-build-
ings containing coal consumers to be
altered (at their occupiers' expense), so
that my patent “Pure Air Heat Producer”
might be built in where necessary.
With these simple regulations to assist
him, Sir WILLIAM RICHMOND and his col-
leagues should make London the pleasantest
city imaginable.
Still another suggestion. Most people
nowadays are fond of tobacco. Why not
make those devoted to the weed nicotine
consume their own smoke?

who have yielded, men who were thought, if I may so speak of
their minds and consciences, to be muscular until they proved
themselves to be merely molluscous, and who are now sailing
serenely on with a full wind of popular approval bellying their
sails. You, however, withstood; you have not forsaken the
band of your devoted adherents, and, reviled though you may
be, you still remain, even in your seeming isolation, one of the
strongest influences in the public life of our country.
For that country your affection is said by your critics to be
lukewarm. The statement is an incredible and an impossible
one, and, indeed, it is not improbable that those who glibly
make it know it to be so. True it is that you are not of those
who swagger and bluster and rave about the self-evident might,
power, dominion, and majesty of the Empire; who exalt in noisy
dithyrambics the man in uniform, conceiving this apparently to
be the sole reason for his life, that he should spend it without
complaint in wasting the universe with fire and sword, while
they themselves stay behind and do the shouting. Boastful as
these men are of their strength, they yet tremble, like guilty
things afraid, at their own nightmare visions of alliances and
conspiracies to do their country harm, and turn with alacrity
from the celebration of their own matchless courage to the con-
genial task of fawning upon some foreign potentate, who, to gain
his own ends, may have shown them a transitory mark of interested
friendship. For these you have small sympathy, for you control
your view of public affairs by the spirit of austerity that rules
your private life. Others may toss indiscriminating caps in
the air, and shout hosannahs when men go forth to war. You
still require to be convinced that the war is for a just and a
necessary cause, that your country is not merely at war, but
also in the right. But of all the host who have been lately shouting
shame on you, there are but few who realise, as you do, the

SUITED TO AN HEIR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,- I notice in one of your
excellent contemporaries, that an adver-
tiser makes the following announcement
in a column reserved for matters of a
purely commercial character-
“In earnest. I wish to be heir partially
or wholly to some rich person. A pay-
ment on account desirable.” Then come
the name and address.
Now, my dear Sir, I am equally in
earnest, and have the same desire. But
I differ from my colleague in wishing to be
wholly adopted. I have a splendid record.
I have been expelled from school, spent
several months of enforced retirement in
Portland, and am only on rare occasions
quite sober.
I am-I flatter myself—just the sort of
person to be somebody's heir. That some-
body has a magnificent field for philan-
thropy; I shall take a lot of reclaiming.
But think how beautiful-how entirely
satisfactory-it will be when I become an
altered character. Yours truly,
A THOROUGH BAD LOT.

I QUITTED home when I was young,

But no, 'twas thro' my father's tongue,

His kindliness had only served
Affairs more hopelessly to botch ;
His softness made me grow reserved,

My mother, much attached to me,

How could she prove a certainty,
Whose teaching was so full of guess ''?
Love's messenger, in course of years,
Seemed sent to grant my soul's desire;
Then Saxon instinct roused my fears,
And made me shun his Celtic fire.
For Love should be without alloy,
If one may trust to MUDIE's tales,
And could one ever view with joy
A man whose accent echoed Wales ?
Some foolish folk consult the stars ;
But I foretell from lips and throats,
The vanity of rolling “r's,'
The levity a lisp denotes.

From Dr. LEYDS's pay-grant ;
But still he has no good to say

That taps can never hurt you,
And thus emerge securely wrapped,
A poor man, in my virtue.

And when his less retiring friends
Rushed out to battle gory,
Resolved to meet heroic ends
Upon the field of glory,

The Canary. I thought so. I thought I

The Canary (patiently). As I was saying,
I was quite wrong. I went to a friend, a
bachelor friend, who lived in Great Port-

and I asked him to fly with me. But he
wouldn't. He said he couldn't afford it.

wearing this hat with white feathers. It
was very expensive. And I carried my

not very prudent of you,—the hat I mean,
not the hand-bag. One should always
carry a hand-bag when one runs away
from one's husband. I did it myself. But
one should dress very simply.
The Canary. It's a beautiful hat. It cost
ten guineas.
The Cuckoo (shocked). Ten guineas!
The Canary. Yes. When I got to the

Of whom much ill is spoken;
They say he shatters everything

Of over-bold defiance,

By calling it alliance.

I feel that I must do it.

Yet am I driven to it.

If I speak up for JOSEPH.
In him what qualities are mixed,
Good temper and discretion,
The pleasant speech by which is fixed
The friendliest impression;
Good humour, courtesy and wit,
That has of gall no tincture,
The chivalry that scorns to hit
Except above the cincture!
With temper patient to unloose
The knots that others tangle,

Should make so very 'cute a file
Turn almost soft and silly?

We are but humble mortals;
We never trod the scarlet way
Through Windsor's gilded portals.
We have not felt the subtle fumes
That dim each courtier's eye, Sir,

Of Deutschland's sacred KAISER.
If, speaking in a kindly voice,
A Kaiser came and met us,
The shock that made our hearts ro-

ETHEL AND HER GOVERNESS.
(A story for Girls—quite the latest pattern.)
With a heavy heart ETHEL strayed into
the garden, where she found her brother
making a catapult.
“TOM," she said, “I come to you for
sympathy. True, I am eleven while you
are a full year younger. Yet surely you
will understand. Like most girl heroines
in the modern gift-book for children, I
am misunderstood, TOM,-cruelly, deeply
misunderstood."
"You look a bit cheap," said her brother.
“ Too much Turkish delight, I suppose ?”
“Nay," answered ETHEL, with a patient
smile; "'tis my environment that irks
me; most of all, it is the companionship of
that crude Miss WAGTAIL, forced upon me
by our unthinking parents. Two dreadful
hours have I endured with her this very
afternoon!”
“She gave you beans?” enquired her
brother, with interest.
“She gave me dates-sordid,unimportant
dates. As if any cultured being at my
age could care for such things ! Imperi-
ously-harshly, even-she demanded the
year of WILLIAM the Conqueror. Dear
lady,' quoth I, pray seek it for yourself
in that history book, which is too dull to
be inaccurate.' But the stupid creature
insisted, and so, willing to humour her
odd fancy, I suggested 1815. And then
her language became more coarse, more
intemperate than before!”.
“She can jaw," Tom admitted; “but
jawing don't hurt anybody."
“Then I was sent to practise-scales,
exercises, all the dull conventions of
ordinary music. With a gesture of, dis-
gust I Hung the things into the fireplace.
And then I called in the aid of true,
untrammelled music to express the feelings
of my soul. I jammed down the loud
pedal, shut my eyes, and struck as many
notes as I could cover with the palms of
both hands. Oh, the dear discords that
arose! But at the end of two minutes,
Miss WAGTAIL came rushing upstairs and
bade me cease. Soon I shall have to go
for a walk with her-to listen to her
dreary common places about ridiculous
things. And all my efforts to lift her soul
to more cultured interests seem vain!”
There was a moment's silence, during
which Tom looked curiously at his sister.
“I say," he asked at last, “do you
always talk like this nowadays?"
“Invariably,” said ETHEL. "Don't you

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
OPPORTUNELY at a time when the country is at fever heat of
warlike patriotism, SMITH, ELDER bring out the story of the
great war that ravaged the Continent between the years 1793
and 1815. Mr. FITCHETT has planned a work of four volumes,
the first issued carrying the narrative from the Low Countries
to Egypt. How England Saved Europe is the title of the
work, a phrase based on a sentence from PITT's last public
utterance, “England has saved herself by her exertions and
will, as I trust, save Europe by her example." Mr. FITCHETT
handles a glowing pen, and illumines as with torchlight the field
on which opened Piit's long struggle with NAPOLEON. He
is, my Baronite thinks, even better at sea than on land, and
is certainly happier, since, if England saved Europe, it was the
navy that a century ago saved England. The pluck of the British
sailor, the bull-dog tenacity with which when he had got his
teeth in the timbers of a French or Spanish ship he held on, is
the more to his credit considering the dog's life-literally the
whipped dog's life-he led on board ship.
Our Messrs. BRADBURY, AGNEW & Co. have issued a most
attractively illustrated catalogue of various unique works they
are offering to the public at this present time (or time for a
Christmas “Present''), at such prices as would be ordinarily
considered as “giving them away." But such literary and
artistic treasures are-and the Baron begs to impress this as a
fact on his readers-simply invaluable. So, as the butcher in the
market shouts out, “Buy, buy, buy!” and as the KIPLING at
the counter cries aloud, “ Pay, pay, pay!”.
In The Progress of Pauline Kessler (JOHN LONG), Mr. FREDERIC
CARREL, as it seems to the Baron, having taken for his
audaciously unprincipled heroine a descendant of the Becky
Sharp stock, determined that as an adventuress she should
“go one better” than her immortal Thackerayan prototype;
and in placing her in a situation the unpleasantness of which
is relieved by no touch of humour, he has certainly succeeded
in out-beckying Becky. The climax of Pauline Kessler's pro-

With floods of wrath too deep to damu ?
Most apt to win applause of men
To know, without the need of thought,
Why did I use a ribald word
On any shores but England's own;
Just when a war is right or not;
To rhyme with Mr. MASSINGHAM ?
Fresh fields it finds and pastures new And whether Duty bids us beat
Confession seems to make it worse-
But what shall we poor jesters do ?
The foes of Britain or of Crete.
So please omit the present verse.
Famine of Humour stalks the earth : To learn how best to shun the Pit,
When I review our common past,
In drought of Laughter droops the age; That primrose path where ROSEBERY ran; The poignant bliss, the trivial ache;
Scant is the mellowing rain of Mirth, Which side the fence one ought to sit I see how recklessly you cast
And few the founts of Badinage;
With CAMPBELL-, or with -BANNERMAN; | | All else aside for Conscience' sake;
What shall we do, now you are gone, | Which Paul a man should march behind, If it would give that organ pain,
Whose wealth we used to live upon! The METHUEN or the KRÜGER kind. | I would not have you back again.
More punctual than the morning's post, And yet 'twas not your views alono, Farewell, farewell, suggestive ghost !
That print arrived that bore your seal; (often themselves devoid of art,)
Without you, how the world is strange!
The toothsome peer of buttered toast, It was the subtle tinbre or tone
New voices rule the ancient roast,
Its charm beguiled the early meal : | Making appeal from heart to heart; | And Echo marks her half-penny change ;
Laughter, they tell me, loud and rude, i 'Tis this that round the memory clings Has every source of Humour fled ?

RE
as it is in the romantic comedy by Mr. RICHARD GANTHONY,
entitled A Message from Mars, now being performed at the
Avenue Theatre, the ground of his conscientious objections
would have been cut from under his feet. A Message from Mars,
reminiscent as it is of DICKENS' Christmas Carol, being founded
on precisely the same idea brought up to date, is not only
admirable in its moral teaching, but is at once the least con-
ventional, the most naturally comic and genuinely pathetic
play that has been produced within, we should be inclined to
say, the last twenty years. The dramatised versions of DICKENS
Christmas books were excellent stories, but indifferent plays.
It is a piece which, we think, could be seen more than once
with increasing pleasure ; a compliment that can be honestly
paid to very few plays, ancient or modern. What is the idea ?
Merely this : we have before our eyes an apparently hopelessly
selfish man, who, in a dream, is converted into the most unselfish
being through the agency of a supernatural messenger from
Mars, who is to him what Marley's Ghost and the Spirits of Past,
Present, and Future were to the miserly Scrooge. The chief
character, Horace Parker, may, indeed, be fitly described as
Scrooge's great-grandson, while his supernatural and rather
clerically-preaching visitant, the missioner from the above-
mentioned planet, impressively played (of course as a “star
part") by Mr. G. E. TITHERADGE, bears an uncommonly strong
resemblance to our old friend the Ghost in Hamlet, only that
he has the advantage over that pedestrian apparition in
possessing the power of flight, so that, without evident wings,
he ascends, instead of returning below at cock-crow to that
uncomfortable residence which the Shakespearian Shade so
thrillingly describes. Scrooge's great-grandson has as rough
a time of it during this vision as had his Dickensian ancestor
during his; and on awaking he proves himself to be as entirely
a changed character-changed of course for the better, nay for
the best-as was old Scrooge after the departure of the last of
the Spirits. Such is the bare outline of the play: but where
would its success have come in without admirable acting, sucb
as at this Theatre interprets it to the public? Where could it
have been without CHARLES HAWTREY? Is there another actor,
English or French, who could have played the part of haunted
Horace Parker and made it a modern possibility? No praise can
be too high for CHARLES HAWTREY in this character.
Miss BELLA BATEMAN is excellent as the aunt; and Miss

| The idea of “Happy Thoughts" did not occur to the author of
that immortal work in the way narrated by the musical ARTHUR
to the literary ARTHUR. Of the origin, rise, and progress of
“Happy Thoughts," something will be said in certain forth-
coming reminiscences, but that something will not be anticipated
here. Literary ARTAUR justly appreciates musical ARTHUR'S
rare qualities, and the Baron takes this opportunity of heartily
testifying to the truth of a most interesting summary of charac-
ter given at p. 218, &c. For the true story of the rupture
between the incomparable librettist, W. S. GILBERT (on the one
part), and musical ARTHUR with delicately-placed D'OYLY
CARTE (on the other), we must await their reminiscences.
The Boys of the Priory School, by FLORENCE COOMBE (BLACKIE
AND SON), will find many friends among our schoolboy-readers,
for this is a most stirring tale of school life-full of interest
from beginning to end.
Writing just a year ago on the appearance of Mr. SYDNEY
LEE's Life of Shakespeare, my Baronite welcomed it as the best
book on the topic that has appeared through the centuries.
That this view was shared by the public appears from the grati-
fying fact that the book rapidly ran through four editions.
Messrs. SMITH, ELDER, have now brought out a library edition,
illustrated with many interesting, some raro, pictures. The
handsome volume is expanded beyond the limits of its modest
progenitor in various directions suggested by further study and
by hints from authorities. In its new form it will worthily take
its place as a classic.
To the Oxford “Thumb” Edition of English Classics, Mr.
HENRY FROWDE has added The Compleat Angler. How Piscator,

MR. BIRRELL AMONG THE PROPHETS.
(By Mr. Punch's Depreciator.)
[At a session of the National Liberal Federation, held at Manchester, a
resolution was moved by Mr. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL to the effect that "there was
no option but to prosecute the war vigorously"; also that the right of critici:m
should be reserved.]
They did you wrong, my dear AUGUSTINE BIRRELL,
They missed the character that stamps your brow,
Who took you simply for a sort of squirrel
That quaintly pirouettes from bough to bough.
They thought that when you roamed the Liberal rosti um
A constant cachinnation must occur,
Nor deemed you could prescribe a serious nostrum
Suitable for the needs of Manchester.
But there were some of us who knew your nature,
To whom your martial manner most appealed,
Taught to admire and dimly emulate your
Peculiar courage in the cricket-field.
We knew your air (at leg) sublime and solemn
That answered to the high occasion's call;
We had observed your shin-bone's stately column
Come into contact with the bounding ball.
One fancies how you faced the fiery Caucusı
Bidding it hold its judgment up its sleeve,
Control the rising passion to be raucous,
And hush the bosom's tendency to heave.
One seems to catch the transient ray that trembled
Lonely athwart the preternatural gloom,
Then when you hinted how the foe resembled
A burglar drifting round your dressing-room.
While he was busy with your shaving-tackle,
While he annexed your soap and collar-stud,
It was no time, you said, for legal cackle,
The thing you wanted was the burglar's blood.

SPORTING RETROSPECTIONS.
WITH a sad regret, alack!
Pleasant memories are blended,
To the sportsman looking back
On the season that is ended.
With a sigh my book I scan,
Many a loss and gain recording ;
of the favourites that ran
Reminiscences affording.
How the throbbing pulses stir
To recall each glorious meeting-
Epsom, Ascot, Doncaster-
Newly their delights repeating!
Now, alas! I must resign,
All despondent and sad-hearted,
Sporting joys of ’ninety-nine
To the realm of days departed.
Yet I own this somewhat tends
To alleviate my sorrow-
Though to-day the season ends,
It begins again to-morrow.

It is stated that the Maharajah of
Dholpur, when calling on Lord ČURZON
the other day, wore massive ropes of
pearls and used a new set of gold carriage-
harness. Here is an opportunity for the
Viceroy, when he returns to this country
or visits it, to introduce such magnificent
fashions. What a chance for the writer
of “My Social Diary," in the Daily Mail,
to improve upon the trifling fashionable
intelligence now provided, such as,-
“Mr. JONES was walking down Bond
Street in a tweed suit and a bowler hat."
This is what we may expect then :-
Lord CURZON was walking in the Park
in a very elegant morning suit of black
velvet, the coat trimmed with large pearls,
in place of buttons, à la Chevalier, and the
trousers, very wide over the boots,
adorned with two rows of pearls down
each side in the same style. He was
followed by three Indian attendants,
carrying his umbrella, which was of white
satin, his cigar case incrusted with rubies,
and his overcoat of cloth of gold.

In his books, from The Inland Voyage down to Weir of
Hermiston, there are found many loopholes opening on the soul
of ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. In his Letters (METHUEN), noonday
light blazes upon the strangely moved, often turbulent, entity.
Writing to a familiar friend, STEVENSON told everything, not only
where he walked, what he ate for dinner, how sorely he was in
lack of “dibs,” how grievously he suffered from illness, how he
covertly dropped some money to be picked up by a repulsive
street-walker pursuing him at Portobello, what he had written
and what he thought of it, what he was going to write and how
much better he thought of that. Mr. SYDNEY COLVIN edits the
Letters with discriminating hand. Much he has kept back, and
here and there in those printed is a tantalizing hiatus. What
is left abundantly suffices to bring the reader unveiled into the
inner presence of a rare mind. We are accustomed, even ad
nauseam, to hear STEVENSON extolled as a master of literary
style. My Baronite believes that absolutely the most perfect
specimens of his style will be found in the unpremeditated
strain of these letters, hurriedly written in varied circumstances
-in bed, in the train, hungry, once at least over-full, sometimes
weary, often sick, as he thought, unto death. There is one
phrase in an early letter, written twenty-four years before the
Jameson Raid, which sums up in six words the proceedings of
the famous South Africa Committee appointed to inquire into it.
“Simpering honesty whilst they suppress documents.” Had he
been free from personal connection with the Committee, Sir
WILLIAM HARCOURT would have given £10 to the Clergy Relief
Fund to have hit upon the phrase. Amongst the many ex-
cellences of Mr. COLVIN's work is a detail, rare if not new. At
the head of each page he cites not only the date the story
has reached, but the age of the subject of the memoir, an
immense convenience in reading a biography.
Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAM ABECKETT correctly describes his
latest contribution to general literature, entitled London at
the End of the Century (HURST AND BLACK ETT), as “A Book of
Gossip," which is just precisely what it is. It reminds the
Londoner of a variety of things he may have already known and
forgotten, and tells a country cousin much that is worth

(By Mr. Punch's Depreciator.)
[Speaking at Newcastle, Lord DURHAM was
pleased to reiterate the criticism which he had
passed at a fat-stock luncheon on the appointment
of General GATACRE to the command of a brigade.]
YE amateurs of England
Who keep your native seats
And criticise so bravely
The fighting man's defeats ;
Ye turkey-carpet warriors
Who ventilate your view
Of what could be accomplished
If things were left to you:
Ye Daniels, come to judgment,
Lord D-RH-M and the like,
Who for your country's service
Do not propose to strike;
Who rise at fat-stock luncheons
And show the obvious flaw
In strategy that marches
Upon an empty maw:-
My paper-map civilians !
One cannot but admire
With how sublime a courage
You face the club-room fire;
With what prophetic wisdom
You speak the warning word,
Choosing the happy moment
When things have just occurred !
There runs an ancient proverb,
Good for the swollen head,
How fools rush in serenely
Where angels fear to tread;
But here the common mortal,
The stroller down the street,
Knows better than to follow
Your rash, intruding feet.
To each his own opinion ;
You have a right to yours ;
But not the right, believe me,
To boom it out-of-doors ;
If decent folk are silent,
Are they for that less wise ?
No, no, it is in manners
The shocking difference lies.
Is not our task enough, Sirs,
To bear the present hurt,
That you on wounded honour
Must dump your little dirt ?
You, from your padded arm-chair,
Safe in a sea-locked land,
While those you smirch are holding
Their lives within their hand.
When we are short of critics
To sum the final blame,
We'll ask a fighter's verdict
Upon a fighter's game;
But you who pass opinions
On work but half begun,
Please give us your credentials,
Show something you have done!

THE COMING CENTURY.
SCENE — The House of Commons. Enter mild-looking individual at
door leading to Reporters' Gallery.
Custodian. Can't pass there, Sir. Roserved for the ladies of
the Press.
Individual. But can't I go into the House itself? The public
are admitted nowadays?
Custodian. Oh, yes, Sir, but only females. That regulation
has been in force ever since the passing of the Equalisation of
the Sexes Adjustment Act.
SCENE- The Foreign Office. Enier Foreign Ambassador with
Declaration of War.
Messenger. Can I be of any assistance to you, Sir ?
Ambassador. Will you kindly direct me to the Commander-in-
Chief of the British Army?
Messenger. Sorry, Sir, but there is no Commander-in-Chief.
The patent of the last one expired about five years ago.
Ambassador. Then direct me, please, to the next in command.
Messenger. Sorry again, Sir, but next in command is on
sentry-go. Only one soldier belonging to the British Army
nowadays, and he's a volunteer.
Ambassador. What shall I do with this Declaration of War ?
Messenger. Oh, that, Sir ? They will deal with that in the
Arbitration Department, next door to the room reserved for the
Commissioners in Lunacy.

MOTTOES FOR THE MILLION.
Football men.—“Horresco referens,” I shudder when refereeing.
M. de R-g-m-nt.—“Hic jacet," here he lies.
The Dervishes.—“ Dum spiro, spearo."
Briefless Barristers.—“Vacs. et præterea nihil.”
Conscientious objectors.-“ Pox vobiscum !”
'Bus conductors.--"I know a Bank.”
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
SORS CÆSARIANA.—Gallia est omnis divisa. Undoubtedly you

A GHOST STORY.
Uncle John was at the most exciting point of one of his most thrilling ghost stories : “The door opened, a strange white light was projected into
the room, and approaching, yet without movement, gliding along without the slightest sound, came a tall, weird, ghostly figure in a white robe, the Lady
of the Moat, whose appearance on that fateful night meant- " * * * * Well, it meant that we were all to be bundled off to bed as quickly as

SPORTIVE SONGS.
(An old Bachelor sitting over the Yule Log carsts
back his Memory of Christmas Day.)
The fire is getting very low,
The log is failing fast,
But in the dim red afterglow
I think upon the past,
And muse upon that Christmas day
When you and I first met
Beneath a silver.berried spray-
I feel its power yotl
The fire is getting lower still,
The log is well-nigh ash,
The while the air may not strike chill
Athwart the creaky sash,
My heart is warm with thoughts of you,
It fears no Winter snow-
You were the nicest girl I knew
At Christmas long ago!

The fire is darker, almost gone,
For me it still burns bright,
My flame, Matilda, never shone
With clearer, purer light,
Not o'en upon that Christmas day
In A.D. '69,
When all the world was blithe and gay,
And I hoped you were mine!
The fire is out, Matilda dear,
Nought left but calcinad 'white,
My diary will make quito clear
The words I spoke that night.-

A SONG OUT OF SEASON.
IN
LET others sing the joyance,
So-called, of Christmas cheer,
I view with veiled annoyance
This section of the year;
What though our rheumy noses
With fog are painted black,
I say I sigh for roses,
I want the Summer back
Da
We sat beside the heat-waves
Which I shall always miss
Till memory, O my sweet, waives
That dream of melting bliss ;
We plucked in various places
old Tempus on the wing;
By day we did the Races,
By night we did The Ring.
D
'Tis true our brows were moister
Than I should care to say;
We could not eat an oyster,
Oysters are death in May!
The joys of Monte Carlo
Were wanting—that is true,
But never mind! at Marlow
We “punted” all we knew.
Queen's had its bike-gymkhana,
The Park its church-parade;
We read Dreyfusiana
In Richmond's pleasing shade;
We patronised the pictures,
Unsheathed our critic-stings,
And passed amazing strictures
On Art and other things.
Putney provided polo,
Henley the College-barge;
I warbled (once) a solo
There by the verdant marge;
At Lord's (in lovely weather)
We lunched upon the lawn;
We supped, like wolves, together,
Together danced till dawn.
Compare the treats that follow
In Winter's weary train!
To smile and smile and swallow
Mince-pies that make for pain !
So, though we have the plumber
To heal us when we crack,
I say I sigh for Summer,
I want the Season back!

London.
Tourist. Why, what is this magnificent
place, with its gorgeous palaces, splendid
grounds, and indescribable tout ensemble ?
Resident. It is quite the finest place in

Tourist. So I see. Is it the Crystal
Palace transplanted from Sydenham ?
Resident. Oh, no, a far more important
establishment.
Tourist. Then is it the property of
Royalty ? Is it a combination of Windsor,
Buckingham Palace, and Balmoral ?
Resident. Yes; it is a combination of the
places you have mentioned, but it is pri-

Tourist. Indeed! Then what is it?

Railways were abolished years ago.
Traveller. Then can I get about in a
balloon ?
Messenger. Oh, they burst up as soon as
they were started.
Traveller. Then can't I go by electricity ?
Messenger. Not since electricity has been
superseded by the new force.
Traveller. Then, wasn't there a pneu-

Messenger. Quite out of date. That sort
of thing never paid a farthing dividend.
Traveller. Can I travel by the Thunder-

Messenger. Oh, that affair was closed by
the County Council. The cars were ir

advertised destination, and there were
heaps of accidents.
Traveller: Well, how do I get to Putney ?
