PREFACE

IT
T was a nice frosty day in late July. The Chief, after a two hours' turn of inspection in the saddle, was engaged in
breaking fast with a nipping and an eager air.
“What is that cheering in camp ?” he asked of a member of his Staff.
“ Distinguished-looking civilian, Sir," replied the Officer, “just come up by the new Laing's Nek route.
Getting a great reception from the men.”
“Pass properly signed ?” asked the Chief.
“ Seems to have got through without one, Sir. Just showed his card, and came straight on.”
“ And what was the name that had this magic power ?”
“Well, Sir, if I may venture to say so, there can only be one answer to that question.”
“ Not Mr. Punch ?” cried the Chief, in a flash of incredulous illumination.
“ The same, Sir," replied the Officer; "and he begs the honour of a short audience.”
“ Then say that I am at his immediate service,” replied the Chief ; “and we must arrange to postpone the battle
for a bit.”
“ And how goes the world at home ?” said the Greatest Little Soldier to the Greatest Little Civilian, after a
warm exchange of greetings.
“My Lord,” replied Mr. Punch, “the country is rather more obliged to you than I can ever remember its being
to anybody in my time. But no doubt you have heard of the relief of London. Well, the shouting is off just now,
and the bunting has gone to the cleaners to get ready for your home-coming. Meanwhile, we await the finishing strokes
with perfect patience; tempered, perhaps, by a paltry prejudice in favour of seeing a few guns captured ; merely as
mementoes, of course. But you yourself, my Lord, must have noticed the carious secretiveness of the Boer nature
in regard to this class of portable bric-à-brac. However, the best of human systems cannot command perfect success, as
they say at the War Office And the mention of that Institution reminds me that the country, which is not in a mood
for forgetting, looks to you and your Chief of Staff for a few home truths in a certain quarter on your return. Apart
from the immediate fruits of victory, your splendid work and the generous sacrifice of England's best blood will not
have been without their reward if we take to heart the lesson we have learned against the future's needs. You have
saved us, my Lord, in a tight corner; it must, and shall, be the business of those at home to whom the nation entrusts
her destinies to invent a better system, which shall have no use for tight corners at all.”
At this juncture the eloquence of the Distinguished Civilian was interrupted by an A.D.C., who approached and
saluted.
“Commando of two thousand, Sir, just brought in under guard."
“Who took them ?” asked the Chief.

“Sergeant of the Dublins, Sir, on outpost duty, reports that he surrounded them with a picket of twelve.”
19219.2. “Good for the ould counthry,” replied the Chief ; " but what are the actual facts ?”
“Commandant has another story, Sir, which you might like to hear.”
“ Have him brought round,” said the Chief.
Briefly, the statement of the Boer leader went to show that his commando had yielded not to physical force but
to moral pressure, under the following remarkable circumstances. With their recoguised aptitude for acquiring
information of events in our camp almost prior to their occurrence, they had heard of the arrival of Mr. Punch and the
fresh enthusiasm with which his presence had inspired the British troops. His mere name had long been associated in
the minds of the Boers with a holy awe which did credit to their limited intelligence. And now he had appeared in the
midst of an army already confident of ultimate triumph, and, according to rumour, had brought with him, under cover
of a private ambulance waggon, a species of ammunition so constructed as to render those who employed it invulnerable
to attack, and to guarantee a holocaust of the enemy at every discharge. Against these conditions the Boers had
concluded that it was not good enough to prolong the struggle, and had accordingly come in to surrender their arms.
“ Believe me,” said the Chief when the Commandant had withdrawn under escort with a bottle of champagne
and a brace of Havanas, “ believe me that I am delighted to accept any assistance, even from unofficial sources, which
may tend to accelerate the conclusion of this war. I speak, therefore, in no spirit of petty envy when I say that I
sincerely trust that you have not, in a moment of absent-mindedness, brought into camp any form of ammunition
which is not permitted by the unwritten laws of international courtesy. The propriety of lyddite has been called in
question : but it would seem to be entirely negligeable in its effects as compared with the explosive which you are
understood to have introduced. May I ask for a description of its character ?”
‘My Lord,” replied the Sage, "it would not hurt a child. Indeed, it is less a detonative than a kind of food for the
thoughtful mind; if I may say so, a sort of potted charivari. I had intended it as a light delicacy for your sick and
wounded. But I hope also that there is stuff in it to suit strong men; and I am sure that only a bad conscience, or a
digestion unlubricated by humour, has any need to fear its effects. You will, I hope, permit me to distribute it, with
my best love and profoundest admiration, among your gallant troops. As a proof of good faith, each packet bears on
its exterior the modest assertion that it is my

A PLEA FOR A PLURAL.
You, who in sultry weather
To Scotland take your way,
To roam the purple heather
And bring the grouse to bay,
Oh, spo sman intramooral,
Declare, I beg, to me,
If grouse possessed a plural,
What would that plural be?
What fairness is there in it
If other, meaner birds,
Lark, sparrow, swallow, linnet,
Have, all, their plural words?
One grouse we know and cherish;
It shows but little νους,
When ten or twenty perish,
To group them all as grouse.
No matter what intention
Inspires them, I accuse
Of poorness of invention
These paltry single views.
If men may dwell in houses,
Why deem it a disgrace
To speak of grouse as
grouses"
Whenever there's a brace?
This word I note with pain, Sir,
Is hardly to your mind;
You bid me try again, Sir,
Some better term to find.

From General A. to General B.
DEAR SIR, -As you are aware, I have
carried on this siege with the utmost
regard to etiquette, and so far my courtesy
has been reciprocated. The fact increases
my regret at the grave breach of this
principle which was committed by your
force in last night's attack. In a word,
Sir, some of the ruffians under your com-
mand actually employed the bayonet, with
the result that no less than five of my
men were severely injured! I cling to
the belief that this outrage was committed
without your cognisance; but none the
less you must be held in some degree
responsible. My Government, at my
request, is telegraphing a formal com-
plaint to each of the European Powers.
And I must insist on a full and immediate
apology from yourself. Yours faithfully,
A.
P.S.-It would simplify matters if you
would surrender at once.

SIR, If your fellows choose to get in

take the consequences.
Yours truly, B.
P.S.-Why don't you all run away at
once? You'll have to, sooner or later.

General A. begs to inform General B.

outrage was committed yesterday by

treted, and how they like things done, and other maters which
nobody is suposed to know untill it is explaned to them.
I have made it up a little from a real groanup book of Ettiket,
and a little from things Mother says somtimes, but most of all
from what I have been told by leding dolls with whom I am in
intamit turms, so you may be sure that everything it tells you
is corect, even if PAULEAN PRATT does say she never heard of all
these rules before, because PAULEAN'S own dolls are (I mene it
qite kindly) desided frumps—but what a shame when she thinks
they are so smart, and they are dear things and it is not their
falt if they are comon !
This is all of the Preffis.

1.-ABOUT SOSHUL POSISHUN.
I hope none of you would make such a vulger eror as suposing
that a Doll's rank in Sosiaty is what she cost, which is nothing
whatever to do with it.
For a Doll may posess a welth of golden hare, and luvly close
that take off, and eyes that open and shut, like my sister MABLE'S
last burthday one, and yet she may never be admited into the
realy excluciv set, where all of my dolls are.
And sumtimes a Doll of plane unasuming apearance (and
praps not even wax) is in reallity the grandest pursonage in
the Nursery, besides being the dearest.
Most groanups (except my Uncle MONTY, who is very
simpathysing purson) never can understand this, so the, think
it is wity and amusing to make funy remarks on dolls before
their faces, which is abbomnible bad form, and how would they
like it if dolls said outloud what they thought about them?
A groanup nealy always l'ansies just because he is old he is
obbliged to be funy, and it is mostly such a falure! but my
advice to all my young reders is to folow their doll's exampel
and not nottice it.

and who are outside the pail.

ONCE more has the Druriolanian Army, led by Mr. ARTHUR
COLLINS, Commander-in-Chief and Managing Director of every-
thing in general at Drury Lane, been true to its great traditions
of the Augustan Age, with the result that the combined forces,
under the command of thoroughly experienced Scenical, Musical,
Dramatical, Costumical, Terpsichorean and Vocal Generals,
Colonels, and Captains, have scored a success for the Pan-
tomime of 1899, entitled Jack and the Beanstalk, written by

several times half-way up to the gallery, as if she were about
to join the Gods, but on seeing the place full up to the ceiling,
she changes her mind and “ returns to the stage.”
The Giants are a prodigiously stolid set. Mr. JOHNNIE
DANVERS is a funny King with dance and song. The Cow, by
Messrs. QUEEN and LE BRUN, keeps alive the four-footed animal
tradition of pantomime in the most admirable manner.
The Seventh Scene, The Land of Harmony, by W. HARFORD,
ends the first part brilliantly, and his artistic fancy and taste,
displayed in the permutations and combinations of colour and
design, merit the highest praise. Admirably effective, too, is
the scene entitled The End of the Century, by Mr. BRUCE SMITH.

found the opportunity, and he has filled it not only with dis-

ALGERNON'S Recollections form one of the pleasantest books of
the year. They bubble with good stories admirably told. The
descriptions of London in his youth and early manhood are a
sort of prose Trivia.
Miss BRADDON has always proved herself an able writer of
society stories, and in His Darling Sin (SIMPKIN & Co.) she once
again empties the whole bag of tricks for our edification. The
coulisses of the fashionable world, its great ladies and their
little scandals, murders and law-suits, and those marvellous
detectives who vie with LECOQ himself in their instinctive
knowledge of everything about everybody,—they are all here
again; and if the prolific authoress's legion readers still clamour
for these things, who shall complain that she supplies them?

The New Woman lived in a part of the town
Where very few men lived, and none of them good;
Her wardrobe was scant-only one yellow gown-
And scorn of mankind was her best-relished food.
Her joys were akin to the Red Indian's joys,-
With flourishing scalp-knife the war-path to pace;
She never went shopping for nick-nacks or toys,
But only to meet with and slap a man's face.
She had but one purpose-to “live her own life"
In ecstatic self-worship—a sweet little plan!
There, there, where all lovely emotions were rife,
With ANNUNZIO, IBSEN, and chaste SUDERMAXX!
In the clear amber light of their teaching, she wrote
Books as freely as water in gutters will flow,
Which newspapers noticed but seldom dare quote--
From dread of Lord CAMPBELL'S enactment, you know!
Some admirers she had who preached about Art
And the sin of restricting its beautiful right
To prefer, at its pleasure, the scavenger's cart
To Oberon's car, and in dirt find delight.

FROM MR. PUNCH TO MR. PEPYS.
(After a visit to The Midsummer Night's Dream at Her Majesty's.)
MY DEAR OLD CHAP,—You will appreciate this apparent
familiarity, as,you see, your true character has been “deciphered”
for us; and though, from the sly dog point of view, we enjoy you
all the more, yet we cannot quite bring ourselves—at least
speaking for self and friends I can't-to address you either
reverentially, or with such courtly respect as was our wont
some quarter of a century since. On a changé tout cela.
After which semi-a pology, dear old PEEPS," I come to the
point and ask you, affectionately, how it happens that so little
now-a-days is ever heard, or seen, of you? Pray come up (I
presume this is the correct expression) and visit us for as many
days, hours, or minutes as may be at your disposal. I mention
these limits as time may still be an object to you.
My reason, for being so pressing just now, is that many among
the greatest admirers of your immortal Diary have noticed what
a poor opinion you conceived of SHAKESPEARE'S Midsummer
Night's Dream as you saw it performed. Now, my old friend and
delightful gossip, let me induce you to revisit London and see
this same play as placed on the stage of Her Majesty's Theatre
by Acting-Manager TREE. Such shapely forms, such lovely
faces ! (Of course we will go to the play en garçon, eh,
SAMMY ?) Such beautiful scenes, and as to the acting-well, I
entreat you to accept this invitation at your earliest possible
convenience, and favour everybody with your candid opinion.
En attendant,
Yours as ever,
PUNCH
P.S. (strictly private).- If you are on friendly terms with
WILLY SHAKESPEARE (I say “if" because I am far from
certain)-induce him to accompany you. I think it would be
a real treat for him. Little DAVY GARRICK I suppose you do
know. If not against the etiquette of the place, why not bring
him as well ?

AD ALUREDUM DAMNODIGNUM.
(By Mr. Punch's Vagrant.)
ALFRED, my HARMSWORTH, of the odd things dared
This, I can hear you murmur, is the oddest :
That one who knows the Mail should be prepared
To deem its leading spirit shy or modest;
And should, oh quaint idea, suppose it vital
To hide his name beneath a Latin title.
Misjudge me not! with no such thoughts as these
Have I approached a tongue we are not pat in,
And tried, forgive me, ALFRED, for a wheeze
That should not fail to please you, being Latin.
Where angels might have feared I did the rushing,
But not because I judged you prone to blushing.
No, no! a man of spirit never blames
A brother journalist who seeks to vary
The dull monotony of proper names
By groping in a Latin Dictionary.
Accept it then as being friendship's pignus
That I address you here as DAMNODIGNUS.
ALFRED, with grief I read my Daily Mail ;
For there, set down with many a scathing pen-mark,
Appears the plain, if slightly varnished, tale
Of something rotten in the state of Denmark.
And first I note that any common sutler
Had done his business better far than BUTLER.
Than BUTLER, who to every other vice
Adds this, which chiefly seems to shock and hurt you :-
He did not think a certain League was nice,
Nor deemed our RHODES a synonym for virtue.
And yet he urged, if war must come, 'twere juster
To send out men, and not rely on bluster.
Therefore you let him go, and set your hounds
Full cry on BEACH, our shattered country's wrecker,
Who pulled the pursestrings tight and kept the pounds
That should have left our over-stocked exchequer.
Pence he looked after, clipped our soaring pinions,
And much imperilled thus the QUEEN'S dominions.
And but for BEACH, you cry, we should have flown
Right through the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.
Long since we should have claimed them for our own,
Crushing, as Fate requires, each paltry wee state.
No General would have matched his head, the duffer,
Against stone walls, and found the walls were tougher.
Next, since HICKS-BEACH remains unmoved, you stir
Your gaping public with another story :
How all our Ministers were doomed to err,
Being in truth abominably hoary ;
How this one's seventy, and that one more, Sir,
And only BALFOUR under fifty-four, Sir!
Yet BALFOUR, I observe, has spoken out-
BALFOUR, whose sprightly youth so much commends him;
And, lo! the Tory press with horrid shout
Turns on its golfing boy and roughly rends him :
“Go, go," it cries with dreadful iteration,
"Make way for wiser men to rule the nation."
And still, oh hawk-eyed HARMSWORTH, you pursue
With more than all the ardour of a lover,
From find to check and so from check to view
Your scapegoat-hunt from covert into covert.

as feling the pulce, taking the temprament

Donna Teresa (MACMILLAN & Co.), by
FRANCES MARY PEARD, is, in the true
sense of the term, a comedy of life. The
scene is laid in Italy, and the story is
carried on by a set of well-drawn charac-
ters, of whom, among those who are pie-
turesque and romantic, one is a melodra-
matic member of the dreaded Mafia,
whose action brings in the note of tragedy
that startles the deeply-interested reader.
Could the authoress have worked out her
plot without this sudden shock to the
nervous system, the Baron would have
preferred it. However, the situation is
undeniably a strong.coup de théâtre which

DEPRECIATIONS.
XIV.
Mr. B-LF-R APOLOGISES.
I THINK it would be almost wrong
To say that we are going strong ;
Our recent triumphs, we confess,
Fall short of absolute success.
Things look, at first, a little blue :
They almost nearly always do :
I fail to notice, all the same,
That anybody is to blame.
Although I seldom see the news,
I have my military views;
And fortunately these agree
With those of all the Ministry.
I cannot honestly disguise
That KRÜGER took us by surprise ;
Quite sure were we, or almost quite,
The gentleman would never fight.
We heard that he had got some guns,
But only very little ones :
We also heard of mounted forces,
But never dreamed they rode on horses !
No one can say we made pretence
To any great intelligence;
We only ventured to compete
With vulgar persons in the street.
Under the circumstances, we
Have managed very decently;
On this I would not take the lie,
Not from an Angel off the sky.
The best of human wisdom errs;
Inevitably this occurs ;
At times-for ARTHUR is but dust
I view myself with some distrust.
To fail, and from your failures learn
This is a Government's concern ;
The second stage should be begun
Immediately the first is done.
'Tis an old truth, but very sound-
You get to swim through being drowned;
And this, I feel, is what a war
Is ultimately useful for.
Unless a few commandos leap
Upon you in your beauty sleep,
How can you ever learn the way
To be prepared another day?
They tell me JOUBERT's good old plan
Allows a horse for every man ;
That even on his nurse's knee
He played at mounted infantry!
But when, I ask, has history been
Included in our tape-routine?
To learn in other people's schools
Is contrary to all the rules.
Besides, if this was good to know,
You should have told us long ago;
We've been at work three months or
more;
You might have mentioned it before !
I never heard that people went
For guidance to a Government !
Your Leader is a person who
Does what his voter tell him to.
Excuse a rather feeble smile !
You know my philosophic style;
A sense of fitness makes me wear
This curiously fatuous air. 0. S.

BACK again to happy childhood
Has my spirit taken flight,
On the wings of an aroma,
Through a region of delight.
At a fair suburban play-house
I was seated in the pit,
And I don't know what the play was,
For I little heeded it.
Lo, a faint and sickly odour
Stealing o'er my languid frame!
For a moment I was doubtful
Whence the sickly odour came.
Close beside me sat a lady
Who was very, very stout;
And I saw her take a bull's-eye-
Peppermint, beyond a doubt!
Just a simple little bull's-eye,
Only that and nothing more!
But it made me feel a feeling
I had never felt before.
With a flash of inspiration
I beheld myself a boy,
When I bought them eight a penny,
And they flooded me with joy.
How I loved the faithful friends, who
Never left me in the lurch,
For I crunched them during lessons,
And I carried them to church.
But those blissful days were over,
I was callous, I was colu;
Peppermint I simply hated—
Ugly sign of growing old.
Then my stony heart was softened
In that salutary hour,
And the dewy tear betokened
Sacred memory had pow'r.
Yes, I felt a thrill ecstatic,
As I gazed upon the past,
Full of innocence, and joyful
With a joy that couldn't last.
So I tapped upon the shoulder
Of the lady by my side:
“Madam, may I have the pleasure ?-
Nay, I will not be denied.
“You have proved to me a blessing
(Clasping her capacious hand)
“You have roused the good within me”-
But she would not understand !
And she spoke out very strongly,
Even hinted I was drunk !
Made me stammer I was sorry,
In my lamentable funk.
But the vision yet remaineth
That was mine that blessed night,
When the peppermint restored me
To a region of delight.

III.-VANITY FAIR.
(By H-11 C-ne.)
PREFACE.
IN undertaking this revision, I have
been influenced by the earnest desire of
the reading public to see Vanity Fair
re-set in a CAINE framework. Feeling
deeply, as I do, the paramount importance
of faring and glaring 'actualities, I have
substituted for the campaign in Belgium
the war in South Africa. Having, hov:
ever, personal acquaintance with
military movements or with Bohemian
society, I have supplemented my imperfect
knowledge of the one by a consultation of
old Blue books and the 'yellow' press,
and my knowledge of the other by a like
study of old “yellow" books and the
"blue" press; whilst in many passages
I am conscious that I have been as the
mould through which the sapling of fiction,
throbbing with potential circulation, has
sent its shoots upward towards the lime-
light of popularity.

century chivalry warring with the Eastern followers of the false
prophet. Noble as is the hero, an ideal knight, and, there-
fore, an absolutely exceptional man, the creation of MARION
CRAWFORD, sweet as is the lady of his love, Beatrix, yet it is
Eleanor, wife of the femininely fantastic and weakly pious king,
who, matchless in forin and beauty, an Amazon in the field of
battle, a royal Lesbian though capable of sacrificing her lawless
passion to her better instinct of love • vho is the heroine
of the romance. The scene where Queen Eleanor confers
knighthood on Gilbert-Warde is worthy of Sir WALTER SCOTT at
his best in The Talisman. After the clang and clash of arms it is
a great relief to the half-dazed reader, who feels himself abso-
lutely pushed about and hurried and deafened in these vividly
described scenes, to come upon the sweet gentle cooing of the
two turtle-dove lovers in a quiet spot, “far from the madding
crowd ; ” and this duet is admirably written in the key of true
sympathy. The story of the advance of the youthful Warre
into a strange country, and of his dealing with guides and
scouts, is a lesson in strategy to our Generals of to-day, for
the tactics of the Seljuks in the twelfth century bear a strong
family resemblance to those of the Boers of the present day.
Mr. FRANK BULLEN, reviewing a stormy life at sea from safe
anchorage at Camberwell, has completed The Log of a Sea Waif
(SMITH, ELDER). It is dedicated to Mr. ST. LÖE STRACHEY, to

are due. The public have reason to join in the acknowledgment
of “the one and onlic begetter." The Log opens a valuable and

ness of treatment, the parsimony of its provisioning, the absolute
disregard not only of the confort, but the safety of the crews.
The only fault my Baronite finds with the book is its monotony
of misery. Surely never before, on land or sea, was a boy

IMPORTANT NEWS.
In the Daily Mail of the 17th, the following telegram from
Capetown is published in large type :—"The Boers anticipate
tbat KRÜGER will be crowned at Westminster."
As a specimen of trustworthy intelligence this deserves
some consideration. It will be noticed that “the Boers," not
some Boers,” are spoken of. This anticipation is, therefore,
that of all the inhabitants of the Transvaal and Orange Free
State. Everyone agrees that the Boers are extremely ignorant
and narrow-minded, but even the Daily Mail must admit that
they are not all absolute idiots. Yet if they “ anticipate " such
an event, they are certainly demented. On the other hand,
if they know that the English sovereigns are crowned, not in
the Cathedral of London, but at Westminster, the Boers must
be better informed than the majority of educated people on
the Continent of Europe. Even the hysterical Review of Reviews
could not assert this. So two words of the telegram are dis-
posed of.
It is also stated that “KRÜGER will be crowned." As no
President of any Republic has ever been crowned, anticipation
of such an event would certainly prove the insanity of the

O GRADUATES of London, you will all, I hope, agree
That FOSTER is the very man to make our new M.P.,
For he has played at cricket, and the House of Commons floor
Is just the place, par excellence, for people who can score.
Although a man of centuries, he still is far from old,
And though he's bowled his overs, he is never over-bold,
And though we cannot claim that he has never had a match,
It's quite beyond contention that he'd prove a brilliant catch.
He's been a wicket-keeper, and we naturally jump
To the obvious conclusion that he's just the man to stump;
He also is a famous bat, and you will all admit
The man who hits a boundary is bound to make a hit.
And if you would object that he's the last to come upon
The scene of this election, we reply, he's been long on:
In short our gallant cricketer is going in to win,
And though he may have been run out, we mean to run him in.

their glass shelves and jars of rose and lilac fluids, an incon-

Small convalescents sat round the high stove fender or at low

“Sister" and nurses in their pink-and-white uniforms passed a
group or a cot, some pale little face, stamped with that content
to be at rest which, in a child, is so pathetically unnatural,
would light up for the moment at a caressing touch or a playful
word.
The children seemed to understand that Mr. Punch was their
friend also, and received his overtures graciously, with some-
thing, too, of the gentle dignity with which the royalty of
suffering will so often invest even the humblest child.
Some were too shy or too tired to talk, so they smiled instead,
as the best substitute for conversation-and it did uncommonly
well; but others soon became quite confidential.
REGGIE, for instance, who was recovering from a very delicate
operation, and extremely proud of having been under chloroform
(which the boy in the next bed hadn't, and was considered
somewhat of an outsider in consequence), was in some concern
about his nurse, whose head, as, for some mysterious reason, he
firmly believed, was in the habit of disappearing every night.
REGGIE was half hoping, half dreading to witness this phenome-
non, and see how she looked without her head. “But I never
shall," he lamented to Mr. Punch, “because somehow I can't
keep awake after eight!"
And JOHNNIE, at whcse request Mr. Punch drew soldiers which
JOHNNIE coloured in crayons, seemed to have spent more of his
few years in hospital than out of it, and described to Mr. Punch

Among the many well-considered and well-written contributions,
H. DE VERE STACPOOLE'S “ The Outcasts" is most original in con-
ception, though somewhat laboured and overcoloured in the
word-painting. There is so much to be read and studied in this
Review, that it is better for the Baron to refer his readers to
the volume itself, whose contents will give them occupation for
some considerable time.
In reading The Backwater of Life (SMITH, ELDER), my Baronite
turns with feeling of relief from Mr. LESLIE STEPHEN'S somewhat
chilly biographical note about JAMES PAYN to the essays that
form the volume. Mr. STEPHEN'S constitutional literary manner
may have been cunningly designed to accomplish the certain
effect of contrast with that of the friend he really loved. With
pen in hand he never gives himself away. PAYN spreads him-
self out on every page, flavours every sentence with something
of his inner self, and, being of a beautiful nature, the charm is
irresistible. The paper which gives its name to the collection
of essays is perhaps one of the most beautiful, certainly one of
the most pathetic, in the language. It tells how one who has

For Honorisati
You go on to extol liberty, which, as you rightly declare, is
not to be had in this complex and jarring world without some
corresponding sacrifice; and you beg your fellow-countrymen
not to allow themselves to be dislodged from their faith that
this self-same liberty, with its necessary accompaniment, the
courage not only to speak and hear the truth, but likewise to
endure with equanimity the propagation of that which is not
the truth, will enable us with due patience and energy to
overcome our difficulties-together with much else that is well
said to the same effect.
Sir, I applaud your courage. It might seem to be a small
thing to ask that your fellow-countrymen should, without dis-
tinction of party, have liberty to express what they hold to be
the truth on questions of grave public concern. But in the
present temper of able and distinguished men, speaking in
Parliament or writing in the newspapers, such a request shows
no common measure of public spirit and right feeling. We are
to be baffled in our inquiries because, forsooth, “the time has
not yet come for inquiry and criticism." No comments on the
fatuous actions or speeches of Ministers are to be allowed
because we must not weaken the Government by showing that
its members have more than justified their human nature by a
pronounced liability to error. Mistakes are to be concealed,
folly and rashness and presumptuous ignorance are to be buried
in oblivion-in a word, truth, the truth for which you and 1
and all who value the honour of their country ask, is to be
hidden away in order at men in high place may escape the
consequences of what they have done and may continue to mis-
lead a blinded nation. For Heaven's sake, I say, let us have

pained.

others had done. “Most vexatious of people insisting on

Something had to be done to counteract the influence of the

the MARKISS appeared at the Table and explained that when on
Tuesday he had traced national disaster to the action of the
Treasury, supplementary to the malign influence of the British
Constitution, and to human inability to see through a brick wall,
he had not had in his mind either the Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer or the Permanent Secretary. He was going on to say
that he suspected the office-boy, but, warned by recent experi-

HINTS FOR THE AMATEUR
GARDENER.
February.
THOROUGHLY dig all the beds at the
beginning of this month. All the standard
books on gardening recommend this, and
seem to imply that the work is to be done
with a spade. The amateur probably will
find dynamite much more serviceable in
the present year. Snowdrops, however,
are doing well; a fine show of them may
be found already on many ceilings; they
are quite easy to cultivate. Some people
depend upon the plumber for their supply
of this “ dainty harbinger of Spring."
Sow early peas. A variety of kinds can
be obtained from any seedsmen; but it is
really immaterial which you select. The
sparrows are not so hard to please as
people fancy, though the more expensive
the seed, the more certain is it that the
birds will take it all. Four or five rows
probably will be sufficient, but do not sow
less. One should not miss such a chance
of providing the nice little sparrows with
food. Always be kind to dumb creatures.
Cats are a prolific crop in this (or any
other) month. To raise them to perfection,
plant a small bed with cuttings at a guinea
apiece. An hour later return to the bed,
and you will find at least three cats
scratching it up. They can be treated
with an air-gun, and planted out in any
soil you choose.
(To be continued.)

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Is Sir LAWRENCE ALMA TADEMA, R.A., also among the
novelists ? My Baronite, picking up The Fate-Spinner (MORT-
LOCK), by LAURENCE ALMA TADEMA, was for the moment led
astray. On reflection he remembered that only the difference
between a wand a u separates, in the matter of Christian name,
distinguished father and gifted daughter. It is Miss ALMA
TADEMA who tells again, with charming freshness, the old old
story of man's love going astray from his wedded wife. It is
powerfully written, with background of scenery and surrounding
worked in with hereditary skill. The dramatis personæ are
three in number, each a live person.
The last scene of
the tragedy, a difficult one to manage, is very fine. The little
volume is specially recommended to Members of Parliament,
inasmuch as it is cunningly fashioned in the form and colour of
an undersized Blue Book. Through a dull debate in the House
of Commons it might be safely read without suspicion on the
part of the Sergeant-at-Arms, or wrathful flash from the
gleaming eye of the Speaker.
To the catalogue of British Anthologies already issued from
the Oxford University Press, Mr. HENRY FROWDE has added the
Dryden and the Pope. Like their predecessors, they are edited
by Professor ARBER, and are fountains of ever fresh delight.
There is nothing new to be said of the old familiar friends, but
a tribute of praise is due to the publisher for the loving manner
in which he has set the gems.
The Baron has recently received a volume containing “ the
complete works of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE," illustrated, with
“ biographical introduction by HENRY GLASSFORD BELL"
(COLLINS, SONS & Co.), and a dedication from some one or
other, it may be from Mr. BELL or from the publishers, to Sir
HENRY IRVING. The type is clear, and as the sonnets are
included, it is useful in any library as a handy and compact
book of reference. of the illustrations, rather indifferently
representing more or less well-known actors and actresses in
Shakspearian characters, the best is that of Mr. ALEXANDER as

SIR, -The other day I met Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER, who
reproached me with not having visited his entertainment. How
quick was my réplique! “Mons. ALBERT,” says I, “ you are no
longer the 'Chevalier sans reproche!'". Not bad that; at all
events, it shows I am as good a French scholar as the erudite
critic who wrote “de la Theatre" in his timesly notice of Dandy
Dick's revival. However, that's not my immediate point in
writing. Sir, I went to see CHEVALIER. Let me advise all who
would obtain a two hours' genuine recreation to do as I did.
His songs and impersonations are admirable and in excellent
taste. His coster is as perfect as ever, and his conjuring in
the "Anky Panky" song (by A. H. WEST) is as neat as though
he were a professional wizard. Then there's his performance
on a strange instrument, of his own manufacture I should
think. And in addition to this is a pleasant variety by Signorina

in the next scene, just when the crowd has
broken into the cellar, immediately after
the duel, and when all the people shout
“God save the King!” and the Queen
and Rudolf together accept the situation.
This is a fine tableau on which the curtain
falls to loudest plaudits, and with this the
piece should have ended.
Who cares what happens afterwards ?
Sufficient to the night is the final triumph
of the popular hero, Rudolf Rassendyll,
and of the sweet heroine, so charmingly
impersonated by Miss FAY DAVIS.
Mr. GEO. ALEXANDER is excellent in the
dual part of Rudolf the King, and Rudolf
the Adventurer, both he and the wicked
Rupert, forcibly played by Mr. H. B.
IRVING, acquitting themselves to admira-
tion as masters of fence. It has been
objected that the two Rudolfs do not
resemble one another. There is
force in this objection. Both parts are
played by Mr. ALEXANDER, only that, as
the King, he wears beard and moustache,
and assumes a slouching gait; while as
Rassendyll, he is clean shaven, and
stands erect. There is no other “make-
up”: it is simply Mr. ALEXANDER's face
shorn or unshorn. Voilà tout.
Mr. VERNON is perfect as our old friend
Colonel Sapt, and both Mr. ESMOND as
Tarlenheim and Mr. SYDNEY BROUGH as
Bernenstein couldn't be bettered. Mr.
GEORGE P. HAWTREY, as the old Baron, is
dodderingly funny, and every one of the
others is simply a small character per-
fectly rendered. And the same may be
said of the ladies, among whom Miss
JULIE OPP stands picturesquely prominent,
and Miss ESMÉ BERINGER plays with dis-
tinction the part of Helga von Tarlenheim.
Mr. ALEXANDER has shown a wise discretion
in omitting the final scene representing

My love, I fear my verse can hardly glow
With all the warmth it certainly should show
To-day.
How can I write of CUPID and his bow,
When blasts as in the depth of winter blow
Away?
How can I burn amidst such freezing woe,
When, choked with ice, the rivers hardly flow?
Or, pray,
How rave of rosy-tinted joy? You know
The dismal sky, obscured by passing snow,
Is grey.
Such gloom above, such hateful cold below,
Frecze all my fancies. Frost is now my foe;

AN ACADEMIC PRAYER.
[“ Oxford is considering the crear ion of net
degrees—those of Doctor of Letters and Doctor of
Science. One proposal was that professors and
heads of colleges should be exempt from the
stipulated exercises, as it would be awkward if
they failed ... The Board of Literæ Humaniores
has petitioned to be relieved of the obligation of
examining, but without success.”—Daily Paper.)
Heads of Colleges sing :
With trembling hearts, to you who sit
Mid academic glories,
We suppliants come, O Board cf Lit-
-ere Humaniores!
Ah! hear cur prayers,
And pity our grey hairs
And furrowed cheeks, where wrinkled
care doth dwell!
How can Age find
A heart to grind ?
For things will slip from an old man's
mind
That youth remembers well.
Long years ago,
Ere Time made white our brows with
snow,
When ye were bantling babes with downy
pates,
We haply knew
As much as you,
Aye, haply thought ourselves young
gods
As we disported through the quads
Triumphant from our firsts in “ Mods"
Or “Greats."
Nay, plough us not! 'Twere mad!
How could we face
Mid such disgrace
The chaff-ful undergrad ?
How could we scold the saucy elves
For being plucked, when plucked our-
selves?
Ah, Sirs, be kind
And bear this thought in mind :
Some day, when you've forgot what know-
ledge is,
You also may be heads of colleges,
And crave of others what we crave of

variety of flerce and jubilant attitudes, on either side of two
central figures, of which one was Britannia with a flag, and
the other an open-mouthed lion, quite a masterpiece of artis-
tic genius. To me this lion was absolutely fascinating: no
matter who sang, or who played, the lion sympathised. His
tremendous jaws were wide open, but so craftily were his eyes
painted (I think the effect must have been due to his eyes) that
whether the music was plaintive, gay, serious, or triumphant,
the lion was dans le mouvement. He was ready to snarl, to
smile, to growl, aye and even to laugh-and if it be possible
to “ make a cat laugh," why not a lion ?-and, in short, he was
ready to do whatever the music suggested.
Petite PATTI (beg pardon, Baroness CEDERSTRÖM, and “don't
you forget it''), plus petite que jamais, not one whit afraid of the
lion, skipped to the front, a perfect blaze of diamonds. “Rich
and rare were the gems she wore,” but “no stones, however
precious," observed Mr. WAGSTAFF, “ could equal the value
of her vocally precious (s)tones." Could that lion have got
at WAGSTAFF he would have made short work of him.
And so, when “Rule Britannia” had been given, when the
solos of “God Save the Queen" had been magnificently sung
by Mme. PATTI and Mr. LLOYD, accompanied by the massed
military bands under Lieutenant CHARLES GODFREY, gorgeous
in uniform, and Mr. J. M. ROGAN, also splendid as a Cold-

The Liberal Magazine, being Vol. 7, covering the year 1899,
just issued from 42, Parliament Street, is described as a
periodical for the use of Liberal speakers and canvassers. It
is that and something more. Why toilers in the other camp
should be deprived of the use of this invaluable work is not
clear to the impartial mind of my Baronite. The volume is
neither bulky nor costly. It is, nevertheless, so admirably
compounded as to present a compendious record of the political
year. The store-house is made easily accessible by an admirable
index.

I once was laid up for six weeks with a sprain,
And felt very bored, as if bound with a chain,
But it didn't depress me as much as this rain.
Oh, this is water indeed on the brain,
And nothing to balance the terrible strain !
Not a book or a paper. I cannot attain
To building magnificent “ Castles in Spain."
Nor yet can I deign
Good humour to feign
When Aquarius seems to have turned on the main.
A murrain or blain
On the pestilent rain!
Alas! I am losing my temper-a stain
On my hitherto innocence. Feeling like CAIN
(As I fancy he felt when his brother was slain),
With nothing of charity, no, not a grain,
I'm silently waiting the advent of JANE
With the tea and the muffins, then-hey for the train !
Anything just to clear out of this rain.
RAIN!
(Viewed from a poky little Village with no resources.)
The rain! the rain!
It may be a gain
For the ducks who are wallowing down in the lane.
To me it's a bano
That will rapidly render me wholly insane.
I'm growing inane,
My faculties wane,
Hopeless, I stand at the window and crane
My neck to discover blue sky—but in vain,
For the rollicking rain
Comes pittering, pattering pat on the pane,
And flooding the lane, while I stand and complain,
Goes eddying on till it meets with a drain.
Not a coster, a noble, a serf or a thane
Could relish this rain !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
To all in search of a thoroughly sensational story, entirely
original in incident and plot, save as to one point which is
reminiscent of Called Back, allow the Baron to recommend Wiles
of the Wicked, by WILLIAM LE QUEUX (F. V. WHITE & Co.). Who-
ever takes up this book, if he be of an excitable temperament
and impressionable nature, must be prepared to utilise two hours
at least of his leisure so as to go through with it at a single
sitting, otherwise the mysterious story will get on his brain, to
the detriment of all ordinary business which will appear stale,
flat, and unprofitable to him, until he has penetrated such
secrets as Mr. LE QUEUX, with consummate art, and without
any overwriting or waste of words in mere description for
description's sake, keeps to himself until the very last two
chapters. Now that the Baron has finished it and is “ in the
know,” he feels inexpressibly relieved; yet will it be some time
before he succeeds in completely shaking himself free of the
impression that he personally has been mixed up, as an innocent
agent, of course, in some diabolical plot, and has just escaped
from the toils and the Wiles of the Wicked.
Dr. ROBERTSON NICOLL, a keen and safe judge in the literary
market, did well to induce Mrs. LYNN LINTON to commence what
was designed as a chronicle of her literary life. She died before
the task was completed. In a slim volume, HODDER &
STOUGHTON publish a few chapters which bear the title of the
projected work, My Literary Life. They consist chiefly of
reminiscences of DICKENS, THACKERAY, GEORGE LEWES, GEORGE
Eliot, and WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR. Mrs. LYNN LINTON, in looks
and manner the model of a kindly-hearted lady, was accustomed
when she took pen in hand to dip it in gall. She loved few
women and suspected all men. Poor GEORGE LEWES is severely
handled, and GEORGE ELIOT does not come off much better.

author of Adam Bede. It is where, LEWES and GEORGE ELIOT

the pleasant watering of the mouth a glance down these little
accounts will induce.
The Great Company (SMITH, ELDER) comprises a history of
the Honourable Company of Merchant-Adventurers who, more
than two hundred years ago, were the first that ever burst upon
the silent sea of Hudson's Bay. Mr. BECKLES WILLSON has com-
piled his narrative from the Company's archives, from diplo-
matic documents, State papers of France and England, and
from the talk and writings of factors and traders. A blemish
upon the work is that the author has been somewhat embarrassed
by his riches. If he had compressed his two volumes into one,
by leaving out some tiresome, and occasionally in their minutiæ,
bewildering details, he would have done better. As it is, the
book, with its many maps and portraits, is a valuable addition
to literature. The earlier chapters remind my Baronite of
boyhood's revellings in the works of FENIMORE COOPER. That
delectable scoundrel RADISSON, earliest pioneer of the Hudson
Bay Company, might have stepped out of the pages of The Spy
or The Last of the Mohicans.
The Baron was much taken by the outward appearance of
four little books belonging to a series of The Temple Primers,
published by Messrs. DENT, of Aldine House, treating of
Ethnology, Roman History, Dante, and Introduction to Science.
With which should he begin? His Roman History might want
a little brushing-up ; into DANTE he had been recently dipping;
and from what he knew of Science, he hardly required an
“ introduction” to that party. So the Baron decided on
taking up Ethnology, when, on opening the little volume, he
was so staggered by being brought face to face with a “ Wedda

“ IN A GOOD CAUSE.”
MR. PUNCH begs to acknowledge with
great pleasure the receipt of the
following letter :-
DEAR MR. PUNCH,–We have long recognised
your pre-eminence in the world of humour, and we
now desire to acknowledge, with deep gratitude,
your proof that true humour and true sympathy, if
not the same, are inseparable.
For months past we have been making appeals
for our Sick Children in this Hospital, but though
they are young, the appeal is somewhat time-worn,
and was smothered in the host of newer demands.
But when you took up your wand on our behalf,
the heart-strings and purse-strings seemed to open,
as if by magic, under the combined influence of
your own popularity and of pity for suffering
children.
We are told that the days of Fairy Tales are
past, that even the art of writing them has perished;
but you have proved that the art of acting them
survives when a good cause is brought in contact
with so strong a hand and so warm a heart as
yours.
Allow us, then, to convey to you and your
innumerable readers our own heartfelt thanks, and
those of all our little patients, past, present, and
future.
The Committee of the
Hospital for Sick Children,
Great Ormond Street.
The subscriptions, Mr. Punch is happy
to say, already amount to over £12,000,

About our bikes and motor-cars,
Upon what hobby do they ride

Here our omnivorous readers feed
On “ bits," and “cuts," and spicy

Here criminals we still restrain
In durance vile with bolts and bars;

the English Drama would have done with-
out SHAKSPEARE and J-N-S is too terrible
to contemplate), yet it is daily borne in
upon me that the plays of the Elizabethan
dramatist would gain largely in educa-

dress. I have striven laboriously, ever
since I took orders in the church of St.
Thespis, to educate my fellow-creatures

that we should look for moral enlighten-

Or occupy a mountain-peak. ·

You overlook the world and still

Aloof from vulgar fear or hope,
On ardent aims that end in smoke.

For though, before the present plight,

WITCH-DOCTOR KIPLING,
(See Mr. Rudyard Kipling's letter on
“The Sin of Witchcraft” in the “ Times”
of March 15.)
TO KIPLING, this: there are who much
Admire, they say, his rare and rich
craft,
Yet marvelled at the double Dutch
That so obscured “The Sin of Witch-
craft”;
Who, having studiously toiled-
Opus inutile, infandum !-
Through all its paragraphs, were foiled,
And failed, they fear, to understand
'om.
Some hints there were of men who spoke
In words that were, I trust, not meant
ill;
Of men whose notions of a joke
Were rather practical than gentle ;
Of fly-by-nights, sand-colie, heat,
of pianos smashed as with a pes e;
Of rooms where playful cyclones m et,
As cyclones will, to romp and wrestle.
Of loyalty that doesn't pay,
Pay, pay-it has a money basis;
Of women who, I grieve to say,
Flung caps, an act that leaves its
traces ;
of some one who infects the earth,
And some one's antidote to his bano;
Of Edmonton, Vancouver, Perth,
Quebec and Halifax and Brisbane.
Of some one's head whose hoary hair
Will not, 'tis hoped, avail to save it;
Of men at home who must not spare,
But take and read an affidavit;
Of little tags of journalese,
And stray allusions to the Bible,
And rumours floating on the breeze,
All mixed in one fantastic libel.
Besides he threw in Mafeking,
He threw in dysa, heath, plumbago,
And stuffed with many a wondrous thing

or publisher, and so he will content himself with informing
any who may not have read eight stories by W. E. NORRIS,
bound up together in one volume, entitled An Octare, and
published by METHUEN, that, being well worth reading, any
one of them will prevent a spare half hour from hanging
heavily on the hands of the otherwise unemployed.
“What a nice lot of new friends" Mr. R. W. CHAMBERS
introduces us to in The Cambric Mask (MACMILLAN & Co.)!
When the reader's eye, and ear, have become thoroughly accus-
tomed to the odd-looking, queer-sounding Americanisms, and
when he can, without difficulty, grasp the meaning of the
strange language used by an uncouth set of people, he will
intensely enjoy their procecdings in the “fresh scenes and
pastures new (the idyllic description of which is not the
least charm of the book), as depicted with much quict humour by
the author of their being, and he will soon find himself deeply
interested in the story of the manly hero and the fascinating
heroine who, with the other less important but graphically
sketched characters, play their parts in the “Sweet Fern
Distillery District.” It will be of interest to our esteemed
collaborateur, “ TOBY,” to learn that“SARK" is the name of the
above-mentioned manly hero, though whether nearly connected
with, or distantly related to " TOBY'S ” eminently serviceable
friend and confidant, this deponent author sayeth not. But, be
that as it may, The Cambric Mask is a delightfully fresh,
picturesquely written, and startlingly sensational romance.
The two new volumes of the Temple Classics (J. N. DENT &
Co.) are Cowper's Task-quite a holiday task to the Baron, who
is sufficiently old-fashioned to affectionate Poet COWPER, and to
prize him far above modern incomprehensibles—and Carlyle's
Heroes, whose dashing, spasmodic, kaleidoscopic style makes
the work tolerable to the Baron for about ten minutes at a
stretch.
The New Century Library gives us three new volumes, adapted
to an ordinary pocket and to ordinarily good eyesight, by road,

suitably housing such persons at rentals
of from twenty to thirty pounds a year;
and as their occupations and distractions
require that they should dwell in a cen-
tral situation, it would be well if some
portion of the site laid bare by the Strand
Improvement scheme should be given up
to them. A few blocks or squares of
buildings in this neighbourhood, of pleas-
ing appearance, and not more than three
storeys in height, would be in every way
adapted to their requirements. It must,
of course, be borne in mind that these
persons are not paupers, but respectable
ratepayers and, therefore, the buildings
must be of an architectual style that
will not outrage their self-respect. On
the other hand the rents must be strictly
moderate, any difference between such
rents and a fair return on the money
borrowed being, as usual, provided by
the ratepayers. Until some such scheme
as this is taken in hand the Housing pro-

Mr. Krüger to Lord Salisbury :-
As birds delight to bill and coo
And in their downy nests agree,
So good a thing it is to view
Nations that live in unity!
My Christian hands were never meant
To go and knock you in the eye;
Still less were yours by Heaven lent
To pay me double by and by.
But lo! how lying lips abound !
How Ananias doth increase !
The devil how he prowleth round
Saying that we disturbed the peace !
We who alone with sin would wage
Battle when Satan crossed our track,
Nor e'er forsook the psalter's page
Except to flay an errant black !
Blessing and blest we sought to dwell
On frugal fare from Nature snatched;
Innocent as the young gazelle,
And harmless as the dove unhatched !
How must our souls with rapture melt
When rage and horrid tumult cease!
This notion did occur before,
But then the time was not so fit;
For fear your honour might be soro
We hardly liked to mention it.
But with the present change of scene,
And bloodshed growing rather rife,
My conscience bids me intervene
To end a most immoral strife.
Having already done enough
To “stagger" people, as proposed,
We surely may, without rebuff,
Look on the late affair as closed.
Then with our wallets full of text,
Armed with the Dutch for Dr. WATTS,
We in our simple way annexed
The promised land in goodly lots.
Dealing the first (defensive) blow
From some external Pisgah-kop,
We hoped to catch the heathen foe
On, or a shade before, the hop.
The terms we contemplate are light;
My simple burghers would, I know,
Be willing to accept a slight
Improvement on the status quo.
O.S.
But, failing in our noble scheme
Of self-defence on alien soil,
To try it nearer home would seem
A wicked waste of tears and toil.
How beautiful upon the veldt
The feet of him that pipeth peace!

​ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, March 12.-
No one expected the MARKISS would speak
to-night. House, as usual, nearly empty.
No questions about either peace or war.
Only one relating to convalescent soldiers,
and a bill providing for d.scipline of
Youthful Offenders. The MARKISS in his
customary attitude of profound reflection;

Motionless to-night. All the more
marvel when, of all subjects in the world,
he plunged in Committee on Youthful
Offenders Bill.
ELGIN, jealous for the preservation of
sacred family ties, insisted that if the
Youthful Offender must needs be flogged,
his parents should enjoy the healthful
exercise in preference to the policeman as
directed by the Bill. Had it been any but
ELGIN, the remark, like many others, would
have passed unheeded over massivo head
of MARKISS. By clearly traceable associa-
tion of ideas, sight of noble lord on his
legs carried him back to far-off days.
ELGIN inevitably suggested marbles ;
marbles are played out of school hours ;
school recalls certain interviews with the
head master. In an instant the MARKISS was
back in his Eton days. Was it, he asked,
abruptly rising, the custom then for the
parents to be sent for from distant counties
in order each to flog his own boy? The
MARKISS trowed not. Then why should
there be one law for the poor and another
for the rich? For centuries the sons of
the rich had been flogged at school by
other than the kindly arm of the parent.
Why should the poor have the monopoly of
parental service in this fundamental
matter?

["Miss Walton, the Post-Mistress at Van
Wyk's Vlei, on being threatened with instant
death by the rebel Boers unless she gave up the
keys of her office, placed them in the bos m of her
dress, and told the man who pointed his rifle at
her that he could only get them from her dead
body. She succeeded eventually in escaping witi
the money and stamps, even the Boers applauding
her dauntless courage."]
This is the song of a heroine,
Mid the heroes of the War,

But stood to her trust as a man should

Who scorned the threats of the rebel raid,
And looked down the rifle without dismay,

This is the song of a heroine

Nay, be not coy, these demonstrations grieve me;

Thou holdest me in such a loving clasp,

I welcome thy embraces, but, believe me,
Why we must part.

1 The word Shamrock is of very doubtful mean-
ing. Even contemporary authorities (e.g., Times,
Daily Graphic, Pall Mall Gazette) disagree as to
the exact plant signified.
2 One of these, entitled “The Abgent-minded
Beggar,'' evidently attained a very wide popularity.
Judging from the fragments that remain, it is
difficult for us to see in this production any peculiar
merit.

and am doubtful, therefore, of the extent of the
Queen's order.
5 I am aware of a recent article in the Historical
Review maintaining that KIPLING's verse is a
parody of a still older ballad. But internal evidence
certainly proves that this ballad—which contains
some feeling and genuine poetry—is a later and
more polished work than the crude jingle of the
older rhymester.
6 During some recent research, I came across a
letter from one Ada PARNELL, calling upon all
Irishmen to dip the green in ink, and wear it as a
sign of mourning. This advice was doubtless
universally followed in Ireland.
7 Curious cumbrous vehicles, of which fragments
are still to be seen in our museums. The form of the

machine, a much earlier period.
8 A word of doubtful meaning and origin. They
appear to have been remarkable as birds of a
feather that flocked together. They made a
great noise, but were, we gather, perfectly harmless.
9 Despite opinions to the contrary I incline to
identify the moke with the ass or donkey. In the
works of one Punch, a learned writer, who alone
redeems the 19th Century from the charge of
barbarism, there is an account of a creature
Mokeanna, which I take to be the feminine form of
moke. On one occasion Mokeanna is said to bray,

FATHER THAMES'S TIP.
(By Mr. Punch's Vagrant.)
IT chanced last week that wandering by the marge
Of Thames's tide-its bleakness made me shiver-
I passed a creek conveniently large,
Where lay much spoil collected from the river-
Hencoops and biscuit-tins, and cats whose throttles
Were tightly bound, and hats and boots and bottles.
And many another waif that once stood high,
But, ah, how fortune, fickle jade, upsets 'em !
Exalts at first their honour to the sky,
Next moment turns them into common jetsam-
When, as I mused, a hale and ancient party
Rose from the ooze and gave a greeting hearty!
Right well I knew him: 'twas the River god;
His beard was matted and his forehead wrinkled ;
And from his tangled hair with every nod
A shower of mud upon the banks was sprinkled.
He wore a tunic-nothing could be damper-
And on his head a fragmentary hamper.
“Great Thames !” I cried, “you come upon the nick;
But, oh, speak soft, lest others should remark you,
And tell me truly which shall do the trick,
Which shall be first—the azure or the dark hue?
Since for the crews each day your ebb and flow trace
The course they row, say which shall win the boat-race."
“I never bet," the god replied, “myself,
Although I bear their barks upon my deep tide.
Let others quote the odds and aim at pelf-
I simply do my work with spring or neap tide.
But as for rowing, why of course it's true, Sir,
I can't help knowing just a thing or two, Sir.
I hear the laboured breathing of the eight,
The coxswain's shouts, the finish sharply ringing.
And some, I note, are generally late,
Some fail in drive and others fail in swinging.
The while the air grows blue with loud reproaches
Hurled at the crews by megaphoning coaches.
“And as night's shepherdess at morn is pale,
Her light grows thin and all her starry flocks wane,
So, when imposed upon the balanced scale,
Thinner and lighter grows each tiny coxswain.
Fed upon husks, but ever uncomplaining,
He fades and fades, and thus fulfils his training.

Southern Arabia (SMITH, ELDER) is a
record of successive journeyings by Mr.
and Mrs. THEODORE BENT, through un-
frequented districts of an ancient, still
unfamiliar country. A permanent and
valuable result is found in the half-a-
dozen maps drawn after personal survey
o pathways hitherto untrodden by a
white man, not to mention a white woman.
In his travelling, not always free from
peril, Mr. BENT was comforted by the
companionship of his plucky and resource-
ful wife. On the whole, my Baronite comes
to the conclusion that Southern Arabia is
more pleasant to read about than to
sojourn in. It teems with personages
'grandiloquently styled Sultans, who seem
to be exceedingly mean cusses. What
'they want is backsheesh, and, in the
worls of the advertisement, they see that
they get it. Whilst all the men are dirty,
not all the women are beautiful. In one
of many passages of vivid description Mrs.
BENT says of the Arab girls, “Their bodies
and faces are dyed a bright yellow; on
this ground they paint black lines with
antimony over their eyes. The fashion-
able colour of the nose is red; ring spots
adorn the cheek.” Thus in South Arabia

[The Lancet reports the case of a man who has
swallowed his braces.]
Tho' I was not wont to question
That a healthy indigestion
Could be captured from a crumpet or a crab,
It another kind of case is
If a man may eat his braces,
And batten on the buckle and the tab.
There are times when beef and mutton.
Fail to please the merest glutton,
And I'm personally very sick of each,
And there's constantly a reason
(Such as being out of season)
Why the dishes that I want are not in
reach.
But my fancy fairly riots
In the prospect of new diets
That is opened by the Lancet's gentle
touch;
For when meat inspires loathing
We can always take to clothing,
And it does not seem to hurt one very much.
There is naught, they say, like leather,
And I dimly wonder whether
This suspender had the succulence of
hide,
Or if it was elastic
So particularly plastic
That it easily got folded up inside.
But it really doesn't matter
How you manage to get fatter,
And a recipe is never out of place;.
So if fcebleness is chronic
You can try this modern tonic
And presumably it cannot fail to brace.

IN VINDICATION OF SCIENCE.
[The Phrenological Journal has been examining
Lord ROBERTS's bumps with the aid of a photo-

the region of the parietal eminence" it is con-
cluded that “he can be depended on to do the right
thing in an emergency.”]

Thereby to the Professor of Phrenology.
A photo or engraving will be quite enough
for him
To judge each bump and measure each

He will finger KRÜGER's cranium and tell

And predicate the Khalifa's depravity ;
The military genius of “BOBS” he knows
at sight,
And sees that STEAD has impulses to
pacify,
He reads a bishop's virtues, and invariably
he's right
When endeavouring our public men to
classify.
He hits on each convexity, protuberance,
and bump,
And is never at a loss for what to say
from them ;
He'll prophesy from Mr. Punch's own
time-honoured hump
His power all other's “hump" to take

House of Commons, Monday, March 19.-
Few things more pleasing or touching
than attitude of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD
towards ST. MICHAEL in discussion on
Budget scheme. To the guardianship of
All Angels St. MICHAEL has added the
jealous watchfulness of his predecessor at
the Treasury. Rude boys, like JEMMY

speak disrespectfully of the Budget. (The
CAPÄEN, who never forgives his old chum,
CORPORAL HANBURY, for accept ng a com-
mission, sneers at him as “the acolyte of
the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.") The
SQUIRE is down on them with weighty
reproof. ST. MICHAEL sits smiling and
blushing on Treasury Bench while his
battles are fought by this doughty
champion.
HENRY FOWLER ventured to say War

THE “NOTTINGHAM LAMBS.”
[On the opening day of the Session of the
National Liberal Federation at Nottingham, there
was a stormy display of feeling between the
supporters of the peaceful chairman and those of
the warlike Professor MASSIE. On the second day
the struggle abated. Sir EDWARD GREY spoke in
the place of Sir H. CAMPBELL - BANNERMAN,
regrettably absent through indisposition. The
speaker was not sure, even now, that if we had an
election it would turn on South Africa. There
were other subjects, such as the Workmen's Com-
pensation Bill for agricultural labourers, old-age
pensions, and temperance reform. Here was work
for the Liberal Party.-Daily Paper.]
PRETTY it was by all report
To note the Nottingham lambs at sport;
“Baa!" said the black coats,“ baa! baa !

And "Pooh!” said the white, said they;
But the great bell-wether was indisposed,
And hoped that the struggle would soon
be closed
In a friendly and lamb-like way.
The chair-sheep held that the flock had
sinned
Just on the point where his faith was
pinned ;
A section of sanguine rams had gone
On the innocent wolf his track,
Blundering forth in a blind career;
"Hear!" said the white sheep, “hear!
O hear!”
And " Pish-pooh-baa !” said the black.
The chair-sheep spoke to the faithful
few:-
“What would the Grand Old Llama do ?
He that was head of the ancient run
And friend of the enemy's pack?
He would have tethered those truculent
rams.”
“Ja! Ja! Ja!" said the little white lambs,
And "Bah! Bah! Bah!” said the black.

The new weekly, the “ Londoner"-an
excellent two pennyworth-contains an
article by Mr. F. H. Cowen on the impres-
sion produced by his own compositions on
himself. Charmed with the notion, Mr.
Punch has written to several eminent
literary persons, asking them to describe
the impressions produced by their own
compositions on themselves.
The principal impression produced upon
me by the perusal of my own works is a
splitting headache, especially acute in
the case of my poems. I have a strong
suspicion, amounting at times to a con-
viction, that I generally have a meaning
if only it can be found. In my more
recent works, however, this feeling is
less marked.
A subsidiary impression is amazement
at the number of people who read my
works and profess to understand them.

REGENT STREET.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I do not suppose
that there is a more dangerous place
for crossing the roadway in the whole
of Europe than Piccadilly Circus, and
the charming way in which carriages,
cabs, omnibuses and vans are permitted to
endeavour to exterminate the pedestrian
gives me the greatest delight as I stand
under the Shaftesbury Fountain, noting
the general discomfiture.
But Piccadilly Circus is nothing to
Regent Street itself, where from Oxford
Cireus downwards any would-be suicide
can easily be accommodated. It is a
quaint, and, from my point of view,
laudable scheme on the part of the police
to stop the traffic on one side and land the
"gutter-skippers” on a “refuge.” When
once there the poor creatures have no
means of completing their transit, for the
constable on the 0.P. (or Opposite Police-
man) side has not the least desire to
further their movements. Then the fun
begins. The refugees, tired of being made
prisoners, endeavour to escape. Most
of them do, after several attempts, but it
is delicious, again from my point of view,
to observe the near shaves which most of
them get, and now and again an accident,
possibly fatal, occurs. Long life to the
system, which means short death. Try it

TAE serenity of Cranford had been
pleasantly ruffled. A large poster out-

important lecture upon “The Marriage
Problem," by Mrs. IDEALA BETH. Tickets
of admission were eagerly sought for, and
Signor BRUNONI (the world-renowned con-
jurer), who had secured the rooms for the
preceding night, had to be content with
an audience consisting chiefly of a few
children from the National school.
The eventful evening arrived, and the
rooms were crowded. Even Miss BETSY
BARKER left her favourite Alderney cow
for this occasion (horrible looking thing

BROWN and his daughters-in fact, all the
local lights put in an appearance.

MR. PUNCH, SIR,-I venture to hope that
you will allow me sufficient space in your
influential columns to make known the
inconvenience which attends the wearing
of the khaki. I am proud to describe
myself, and with truth, an Imperial
Yeoman. Is it right, Sir, I ask, that my
uniform should be a cause of mockery and
insult to the man in the street ? All went
well with me, I was dined, treated, and
worshipped in my native suburb, until the
local authorities took it into their suburban
heads to organise a torchlight procession
for the benefit of my fellow heroes in
South Africa. In the said procession were
many cars, illustrative of the war, while
on each car stood a group of khaki-clad
heroes, who were really more or less
peaceable civilians. Myself, I went in
uniform to watch the procession from the
street, and was continually jeered at by
passers-by, and asked why I had left my
car, how much money we had made, where
the procession was going, and whether I
was not adjectively glad that I was not a
real Yeoman. Maddened and infuriated,
I was at length compelled to rush home
and change into mufti, since in that garb
only were peace and civility to be found.
I trust, Sir, that you will give publicity
to the woes of, Yours, etc.,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Duchess of Teck (JOHN MURRAY), will be found generally in-
teresting and instructive. Princess MARY was popular with
all classes, having gained the affection of the people by her
royally good-humoured bearing, which was, as it were, a prac-
tical and evident corroboration of the stories about her un-
affected geniality and warm-hearted kindliness to all with whom
Her Royal Highness was brought into contact. That the public
rightly gauged Princess MARY as one who took very little
pleasure in Court life and etiquette, this little extract from her
diary, taken at haphazard, fairly indicates :-
“ Behind the Fifes' fishing cottage we saw a fire kindled and preparations
making for Her Majesty's tea ; she was riding up the glen, so for discretion
we hurried on to our carriage, and, wrapping ourselves up to our very noses,
the wind being piercingly keen, drove on towards home. . . . Home by 6.30;
had tea to warm myself."
So Princess MARY bolted away from the prospect of tea with
the QUEEN, and hurried off to enjoy the “cup that cheers,” in
her own room, with, it may be, “FRANCIS” and “ HELENA.” The
Memoir, which offers many of these pleasant glimpses to our
view, has already achieved a popularity worthy of its subject.
ALLEN RAINE in her latest novel, Garthowen (HUTCHINSON),
wisely sticks to Wales. As far as novel writing is concerned, this
is a hitherto undiscovered country. As my Baronite remarked
of one of her earlier novels, ALLEN RAINE is beginning to do for
Wales what a score of novelists, following more or less closely
in the footsteps of WALTER SCOTT, have done for Scotland.
Her latest story has all the tenderness, the humanity, the sym-
pathy with beauty in Nature and goodness in man and woman,
that made Torn Sails, A Welsh Singer, and By Berwen Banks,
delectable. It is avowedly the story of a Welsh homestead,
and by simple art the reader is made to live with the inmates.
Morva, the heroine, is worthy of her musical name. One of
the most attractive and best drawn characters in the book is
the old woman Sara, who has a local reputation as a soothsayer.
Her adventurous journey from her mountain home into bustling
Cardiff is a delightful narrative.

rodents, who recently pursued the agri-
colæan spouse, should have been punished
for their impertinence. To those who
appear to favour a Pro-mouse policy, we
would point out that for long mice have
been closely associated with villainy, as
witness the historical intimacy existing
between the white mice of the notorious
Count Fosco and their master, as related
in Collins' Reports. Our only regret is
that the punishment was limited to the
removal of the caudal appendage. This
ill-timed leniency, this policy of “cut
and run," will, if we mistake not, be
subsequently regretted.
The Dollminster Gazette.-We are glad
to find ourselves in agreement, both with
the action of the farmer's wife and with
the action of the mice. In following the
farmer's wife, they surely followed a
natural instinct, whilst on the other hand
some kind of reprisal was quite legitimate.
Whether a dessert-knife instead of a
carving-knife would have been more in
accordance with humane treatment is
arguable. We cannot quite agree with
the Lex talionis policy, and at the same
time we are unable to endorse the forward
policy of the mice.

The plain man else would surely swear
We're still within the Middle Ages,
When credulous folk were none too rare.
Look at the tribe of rogues that thrive
On modern superstitious ninnies !

With eager dupes who spend their
guineas
Within Imposture's busy hive.
Flamboyant “ seers” of either sex,
And ev'ry kind of hocus-pocus,

The gipsy-van was once their locus,
But Mayfair-wards they've all made treks.
They “ give one furiously to think,"
The palmist and the sage who gazes
On crystal or clairvoyant ink,
The scribe of horoscopic mazes,
Winking the ancient augur's wink !
The law is strict with MARY JANE
And her itin'rant fortune-monger,
When, crossing palms, the maid is fain
To mitigate her soul's heart-hunger
With facts about her future swain.

On bigger hawks whose fees are fatter,
Whose“ clients” swarm in tale untold ;

BREAKING THE BANK AT MONTE CARLO.
(A Note from One who has all but done it.)
DEAR MR. PUNCH, -Now that so many
of my countrymen (the word includes both
sexes) patronise Monte Carlo, it is well
that they should be provided with an
infallible system. Some people think that
a lucky pig charm or a piece of Newgate
rope produces luck. But this impression
is caused by a feeling of superstition-
neither more nor less. What one wants
in front of the table is a really scientific
mathematical system. This I am prepared
to give.
Take a Napoleon as a unit, making up
your mind to lose up to a certain sum,
and do not exceed that sum. Now back
the colour twenty consecutive times.
Don't double, but simply keep to the
unit. When you have lost to the full
extent of your limit, double your stake.
Keep to this sum for another twenty
turns. By this time it is a mathematical
certainty that you must either have won
-or lost. Of course, if you have won
you will be pleased. If you have lost,
keep up your heart and double your
stakes again. This time you will be
backing the colour with a stake four
times as large as your original fancy.

comes of it.

APEY THOUGHTS.
[The Academy tells a story of a monkey which
was discovered tearing the article on DARWIN'S
Origin of Species out of the Encyclopædia
Britannica.]
DESCENDED from us? These degenerate
creatures,
With their hideous, human, expressionless
features ?
Great heavens! this DARWIN a monkey
would be,
But, please you, the devil a monkey is he!
Man may copy our ways; he may chatter
and fuss
In Parliament, after the manner of us;
He may give himself airs, like a lord or a
flunkey,
But it isn't the habit that maketh the
monkey.
Can he swing by the tail from the top of a
tree?
Not the trace of a caudal appendage has he,
And so long as he 's none, he will cer-
tainly fail
To make me believe in his dubious tale.

Mr. C-RTN-Y said that the invasion was
wholly due to the mistaken policy of his
Party. He was starting a Conciliation
Committee,” with himself as chairman, to
put matters right.
Sir EDW-RD CL-RKE took the same view
as Mr. C-RTN-Y.
Mr. CONTRITE SCHR-N-R said that every-
thing was the result of the wickedness
and greed of England. He advocated a
policy of non-resistance. We must turn
the other cheek. We had only to give in
and of course the war would stop. How
could it do otherwise? (The speaker was
here interrupted by expressions of dissent.)
He claimed the right of Freedom of Speech.
The English were wrong in this war as in
all their wars.
If they resisted the
righteous attack on London by Russia,
they would repent it. Should London,
however, be so unfortunate-and, he
would add, so criminal—as to repel the
attack, he trusted there would be no
idiotic jubilation on the subject. (Uproar.)
He claimed the right of Freedom of Speech.
At this stage a rush was made at the
platform. Mr. SCHR-N-R was swept off his
feet, and the Hall was wrecked.
On the following morning a letter
appeared in the Times from Professor
D-C-Y, who, whilo not agreeing with the
objects of the meeting, &c., pointed out
that, unless anybody might say anything

assault, the country would go to the

With political aspects it dealt
In a spirit of Radical spleen.

Implored me to take his advice
About patents in bicycle cranks

And I had declined them with thanks!

It will haunt me seductively still.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Arden Massiter, by Dr. WILLIAM BARRY, author of The
New Antigone, The Two Standards, etc. (T. FISHER UNWIN).
Dr. BARRY'S new novel, or rather romance, is of “ imagi-
nation all compact.” Now, imagination, the Baron holds to
be the language of genius. And genius, in his humble judg-
ment, means discerning that which is dark to ordinary
vision. Dr. BARRY, who knows Italian life as few Englishmen
know it, has eyes to see beneath its external phenomena the
workings of great elemental forces. And in these fascinating
pages he has put before us what he sees, with the pen of the
consummate literary artist. The Baron has no intention of
unveiling the thrilling plot of Arden Massiter. But he must
say that some of the descriptions have seldom been surpassed
in picturesque vividness. A few touches from Dr. BARRY'S
masterhand suffice to transport the reader to the scene de-
picted. The Baron will quote a few lines by way of example,
from a page at which the book chances to lie open:
“The hill descended by broad lapses of pasture, fringed with chestnuts,
into the ravines and valleys that went rolling forward till the plain of the
Sacco divided them from other hills and woods. So balmy an air touched
one's forehead, that May itself seemed to be roaming through the land; a
screen of light silvery clouds hid the sun, curiously veined in places with
sapphire and burnished gold."
Every word tells: and the reader sees what the writer saw.

It is the unmistakable note of a proper and spontaneous form:

A handbook, or pocket-book, most useful
for “this present distress" is A History

the 7th volume of the Temple Encyclo-
pædic Primers, published at 29, Bedford
Street. The only fault the Baron finds
with this book is that, full as it is of in-
formation, it is just a little too full of
“matter." At least a quarter of it might
have been omitted, whereby its readable-
ness would have been considerably im-
proved. Also, there should have been
side-headings, let in, or marginal refer-
ences, so that a reader in search of some
particular event, or date, would at once
find it. The index at the end serves its
own particular purpose, but, of course,
does not give dates. In all books of this
sort intended for handy reference, the
marginal general and particular reference,
with date, is indispensable to its perfec-
tion. This apart, the little book“

HALSBURY, no doubt, is an admirable man; so are all the other

the state of mind of Lord HALSBURY and the rest of them if a
constitutional appeal from Federated Australia comes before
them. They have no special knowledge of these matters; their
life and their practice have been pursued in other fields. I can
see them with the eye of imagination laboriously and honestly
"mugging up” the Australian Federation Act in order to
arrive at a decision on some disputed point, and finally reserving
their valuable judgments through a period of months on some
point which Australian judges sitting in Australia would have
decided at infinitely less cost in the same number of days.
Well, Gentlemen, I wish you well in this controversy as in all
others. I believe that the great body of public opinion in this
country is sound in these matters. • You ask in effect for your
charter of nation-hood, and the men of the old country, proud
of your achievements, heartily desirous of your great and
increasing prosperity, and firm, as I hope and believe they are
firm, in the belief that brotherhood and alliance depend not on
wretched forms and irritating technicalities, but on a free and
generous accord of feeling, on unity both of interests and
aspirations--they will see to it that what you wish is granted.
'If your peoples wished to part company from us we know we
could not hold you back. But it is your wish to abide with
us, unfettered members of one vast realm, free to control your
own affairs while sharing our destiny. And that wish of yours,
so nobly expressed, is at this moment our chief glory.

" NERVE."
“ WARS and rumours of wars," at the
present moment, demand throughout the
country that every able-bodied man should
ascertain what condition his own nerve is
in, as well as train himself both to ride
and shoot. The following experiments
have recently been made by way of
testing the nerve :-
BOODLESON boldly asked for his Pass-
book at the Bank, and examined it with-
out shrieking.
Little TIMMINS undertook to ride in a
steeplechase (and only got out of actually
doing it by paying a professional, at the
last moment).
THINMEANS faced his wife's last dress-
maker's bill, with the calm courage of
despair.
BOLDERSON went to hear an aspiring
amateur recite “The Absent - Minded
Beggar," and sat it out.
PUTTER attended a Highland Golf Club
dinner, ate haggis, and faced the music
of the pipes afterwards.*
RUMTOFF, in the middle of the Stock
Exchange, mounted a chair and called
“Long live KRÜGER ! Down with the
English Generals !!” .. We regret
to record that the unfortunate RUMTOFF
got in too late with his explanation—that,
in fact, before he could speak, there was
no RUMTOFF left, and therefore no expla-

[Ex-President Steyn has been assuring his countrymen that thousands of
foreign troops are on their way to help the Boers.]
COME, listen to me, Burghers, and raise your cheers on high,
For the day of our redemption is drawing very nigh,
When the rooineks shall be smitten and be cast into the sea,
And the country down to Cape Town shall be Afrikander-free!
For the nations have arisen and are flocking to our aid,
A sort of universal help-the-Boer 'gainst British raid.
Full twenty thousand Laplanders are sailing from the north,
And half a million Arabs to the south are marching forth;
Five hundred Russian ironclads are now upon their way
To join a million French marines in Delagoa Bay.
Four Army Corps of Germans are now landing in Natal,
We've even got ten regiments from that sneaking Portugal !
From the wild west of America there come the Cherokees,
And the Emperor in person is commanding the Chinese ;
In short, there's not a nation but is longing for the day
When the Absent-minded Beggar shall be made our bill to pay !
When you, my worthy Burghers, shall with loyalty and glee
Proclaim that all your blessings were derived from Paul and ME!

Of warriors bold my numbers told,
With battle's heat inspired.

CAUSÂ HORNERIS.
THERE is, probably, no one of all the heroes of nursery
legends who has had his memory kept so everlastingly
green as has the worthy little Jack Horner, who sat in a
corner eating a Christmas-pie, and who congratulated himself
on his vast moral superiority over all his contemporaries.
There were other good boys, but what a good boy was he! and
being such a good boy, of course, he died early, but he has
never, never, never been forgotten; and to commemorate his
fame, the fame of Horner of mince-pie-ous memory, there was
founded, probably in consequence of some munificent legacy
left them by little Jack, the “Company of the Horners,"
which held its annual meeting last Tuesday in one of the
corners of the City, at the Salters' Hall, St. Swithin's Lane.

["Mr. Steyn has now moved the seat of Government of the Orange
Free State from Kroonstad to Lindley.”—Daily Press.]
We believe there is no truth in the rumour that Ex-President
STEYN will remove his capital to a convenient pitch in the Old
Kent Road.
On the other hand, it is by no means unlikely that, in view
of Lord ROBERTS's rapid advance, the car of a captive balloon
may be the next place selected for a temporary capital. This
would afford a comparatively quiet meeting place for the Raad,
any other spot being so liable to disturbance just at the present

MANNING THE ADMIRALTY.
As I was strolling down Whitehall
I noted at the gate
The sentries, helmeted and tall,
Who sat in equine state,
All heedless of the wide-mouthed throng
They sat in solemn pride,
No cavaliers of fabled song,
But ATKINS glorified !
Impressed as any nursery maid
By those two warriors grand,
I passed to where the palisade
Divides the sea from land,
To that grim dwelling where “the Board"
Controls the winds and waves,
Where year to year the great First Lord
Britannia makes his slave.
Before this autocratic pile
No sentinel is seen,
No jacket blue displays his style,
Nor red of brave marine.

course there must be some good things in the record of a man
enjoying, over a long series of years, the opportunities of Mr.
SUTHERLAND EDWARDS. But my Baronite confesses he is a trifle
disappointed, possibly because he expected too much. The
Recollectioner describes ALBERT SMITH as “ a lively and agree-
able man full of good spirits, and full also of a mild evening-
party sort of fun.” That is a description that will apply to
most of Mr. EDWARDS' Bohemian acquaintances as they figure
on his canvas. As an example of the kind of humour that
made a lasting impression on the mind of the chronicler,
may be cited the case of “HARRY BAYLISS, in whose chambers
was a picture frame with a black cloth hanging down before
it on which might be read in white letters the alarming
inscription, Ladies, Beware. When ladies visited him he
made some pretext for leaving the room, and then abruptly
returning surprised them gazing eagerly upon amblank.

who, again in a bus, pretends to go mad, draws a pistol from
his pocket, is rushed upon by the company, breaks the pistol
in two, hands half to the conductor, and begins to eat the other
half. “It was made of chocolate!” says Mr. SUTHERLAND
EDWARDS, with a note of well-earned admiration.
The gaydog Cavalier period of English History is pretty well
played out, both for dramatist and novelist, and NELL GWYN,
the Merry Monarch, with all his other Merry Mistresses as
characters in a novel, are at this time of day as worthless as
ever they were in real life. Pity that Mr. FRANKFORT MOORE
should have occupied his time and talents on so thankless a
subject as Nell Gwyn Comedian (PEARSON), unless it was with
the purpose of showing how curiously dull was that gay court,
and how forced was the merriment of the Merry Monarch and
his merry courtiers. There is a slight thread of a story, and
in the last scene the patient reader may find his reward, which
comes better late than never.

Yet when the firs wild joy has had its way,
Such joy as not in all the years
Since CAMPBELL'S rescue rang through Lucknow-walls
Has made the sudden pulse of England leap-
Nay, but a joy more full and wider yet,
Because the countless echo of it calls

Where other myriad voices claim
By right of peril shared to have their part
In every shock of joy or shame

the letters which have lately reached the British
Generals in South Africa.]
DEAR LORD ROBERTS, -I should like to
have called you BOBS, only Mamma says
that you might be offended and would
not answer my letter, and then I should
not have a nice little letter from you to
show to all my friends and send a copy
of it to the newspaper; so it would have
been no use writing to you with best
spelling, and writing, too, which takes
ever so long, would it? I ought to tell
you we do love you so much, dear Lord
ROBERTS, and TOMMY and JOHNNY and
FRANK are all going to be soldiers when
they grow up, and beat the Boers and
everybody else like you do.
As I am
only a girl I suppose I shall not be able
to fight, but I shall always be awfully
patriotic and get up bazaars and concerts
and things for the sick and wounded in
every war, and have my name in all the
papers and on posters in the streets,
which will be lovely, and so no more from

CHLOE, once you used to fly,
When returning home benighted,
Did a hare but hurry by,
Timid and affrighted ;
When above you rustling trees
Happened with the breeze to flutter,
Faint of heart, with trembling knees,
Pretty little screams you'd utter.

Now you move not in our mind

Now at gentleness you scoff,

And at tennis, hockey, golf-
Play with us—and sometimes beat us.
Now your shoes are-number nine,
And their colour brown (or yellow).
Now you think it something fine
To be called “good fellow";
And your arm, once delicate,
Now is big and bare and brawny,
And your skin, once fair, of late
Almost verges on the tawny.
But (when all is said and done)
Since you still court approbation,
Take the wiser course, and shun
Each exaggeration ;

Would take your full allotted scope,
But if upon the victor's field
And not collapse before you must.
The final dissolution came,
But you would fain forestall the day, If there your glorious fate were sealed
And rank among the noble dead,
Amid a nation's clear acclaim;
Men who refused to fade away
If (I repeat) on fighting gro
By force of dotage on a bed !
You fell heroically dead-
Between the sheets you would not lie What sort of use could then be found
Under the gaze of hireling mutes, For Pity's arms beneath your head ?
And should the Public sing your praise
With undiscriminating breath,
Exhibiting a partial craze
For such as die a soldier's death-
Lost in the general loud applause,
How could discerning Love dilate
On those engaging little flaws
That only friends appreciate ?
But if, upon the other hand,
You died by doddering age outworn,
Husbanding life's last grain of sand,
Bankrupt, discredited, forlorn ;
Begging for day-to-day supplies,
Too poor to find the sexton's fees,
Facing the quest of curious eyes
With incoherent repartees ; -
Then Love should ease your gurgling
throat,
And hover round your crumbling clay,
And fan your cheek and take a note
Of anything you had to say.
And should the Public (which forgets
Its saviours when the need is past)

“ENGLISH” FOR THE “BRITISH.'
(A tale both practical and poetic.)
AN admirer of the Poet Laureate sat
reading the correspondence about the
terms “British” and “English, " in the
Times.
"Am I an Englishman, or am I a
Briton ?” he asked himself, and could
come to no conclusion. He dropped the
interesting journal and turned to the
latest work of the Poet Laureate, and
allowed his eyes to fall upon the pages.
Then his eyes closed unconsciously. In a
moment there was a complete change in
his surroundings.
He found himself hemmed in on every
side by a number of soldiers, who levelled
their rifles at his head.
Spare me!” he cried. “ You dare not

“To wbat nation do you belong?"
asked the officer, knocking up the rifles
of his men.

I care not much what liars say ;

And spoil the happiest funeral odes,
If they allege that on my heart

26TH TO 30TH.–At times by faith's ecstatic eye
I view the distant port,
Where in the parlous by-and-by
I purpose to resort.
Is it the haunt of summer seas
Where balmy prospects smile,
And only man, who keeps the keys,
Is absolutely vile ?
Lies it below a beetling scarp
Where zephyrs softly hum ?
Where captive Israel hangs her harp,
And Zion's songs are dumb ?
Is it located on the spot
Where dismal Doppers go?
Emphatically it is not,
Not there, my child, Oh no!
Nor shall I sail a shoreless sea
With JAPHET, SHEM and HAM;
The port I seek is Dutch, like me,
And both conclude with dam !

MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
My relations with all the other Powers
continue to be of a friendly character.

over the America Cup, in consequence of

GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,
The estimates for the year will be laid
before you. While desirous of guarding
against undue expenditure, I feel that the
present lack of condition in the country
will not permit you to depart from that
spirit in which you have during recent
years provided cricket-fields, golf-links,
and race-courses for the development of
my Empire.

the younger officers of my army-having

THE PLAINT OF THE INJURED PARODIST.
(An Appeal to the Poet Laureate after perusing his variation
on “ The Light Brigade.")
As when a young thing, all her heart aflame,
Her cheek by steady vigils rendered hollow,
Caught in an ecstasy of maiden shame,
Swoons at the feet of some sublime Apollo:
Then from a dream of chanted Delphic hymns
Haunting the glades of Phocis, green and nutty,
Wakes up and finds her idol's lower limbs
To be composed of ordinary putty:
Looks for the locks that went in wavy lines
Crowning the slightly academic forehead,
And notes the nascent horns and other signs
That mark the Satyr's nature (which is horrid) :
And lastly turns to where he held the lyre
Ready for pæans, rural odes, or dirges,
And there, as though to mock the Muses' quire
Perceives a banjo fresh from MOORE and BURGESS :
So we, poor fools, who hushed our clamorous hearts
Before the image of revived Apollo,
Drank in the beauty born of Greekish arts
And breathed the scent of bays we dared not swallow :
Time was when we believed we had in you
A mine of practically priceless treasure,
A sempiternal source of revenue,
An ocean all unplumbed to tap at leisure.
You were the flower from which, with honest toil,
We busy bees contrived to gather honey ;
But now you grudge us our laborious spoil,
And grow, yourself, deliberately funny!
Shifting your rôle from butt to bombardier,
The victim once and now the bold aggressor,
You enter, at a bound, the comic sphere
And bravely parody your predecessor !

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
To the Healing of the Sea (SMITA ELDER) contains vivid
descriptions of the New York Stock Exchange in moments of
frenzied excitement. Mr. FRANCIS HARDY has evidently studied
the subject on the spot, and is most successful in reproducing
it for the edification of milder-mannered citizens. All the
chapters relating to Stock Exchange transactions are written
with a master hand. When Mr. HARDY takes some of his
characters to the healing of the sea, provided by a passage to
Southampton in an ocean liner, he becomes conventional. My
Baronite recognises in him a man of dauntless courage. He
boldly tells, and spoils in the telling, the story about the Red
Indian, who, seated for the first time in his life at a civilized
dinner table, ate the contents of the mustard-pot. When,
presently, tears of agony rolled down his untwitching face,
and his host asked him what was the matter, he made answer
he was thinking of his late grandmother. It is a little startling
to have this ancient story resuscitated in the conversation
glittering through one of the latest of the six-shilling novels.
In Fate the Fiddler (CONSTABLE) Mr. H. C. MACILWAINE
realises most admirably the experience of two English squatters
in the comparatively early days of Australian development,
before the discovery of gold. If the author's processes are
somewhat leisurely, he justifies himself, according to my
Nautical Retainer, by effects which could not otherwise have
been obtained. We are lent with a firm impression of the
unconscious modifications of character which are the inevitable
result of a life removed from all conventions ; its tendency, in
particular, to accentuate original differences in natures thrown
upon their own resources.
The book is less a novel, in the accepted sense, than a study of
the influence, physical, moral and social, of circumstance and
locality. His Australian types—the squatter, active or retired,

Union Jacks have been flown that were made in
Germany, and incorrectly designed, or else hung
the wrong way up. Many, also, of the cheaper
Royal Standards exhibit the Harp in the second or
upper outside quarter instead of in the third or
lower quarter next the mast. It is noticeable, too,
that the Tricolour has been very largely adopted,
in spite of the fact that, vertically, this is the
French flag, and horizontally the Dutch, while by
another arrangement (white uppermost, blue and

declared who held out for “not guilty" against the other

Wallace collection being installed in a new building, to be con-

in town and country knows where the National Gallery is, but
we should say that the majority (including Provincials of
course) have yet to learn the locality of Hertford House.

driver. “Let's see—ain't that where Sir WILLUM WALLIS

historical knowledge, recalling “Scots wha hae" and so
forth. These are facts. But no doubt the locality will soon
be discovered, as has, I am informed on good authority, been
the case with the Tate Gallery, which is out of touch with
most omnibuses and with Metropolitan and District Stations;
likewise it has no pier for steamers. It possesses, however, a

country some idea of what there is to be seen in this unique
collection. Everyone to his taste, and assuredly everyone
will be individually gratified. For ourselves, give us a few

PRINCE ARTHUR's emotion stirred just
now by PICKERSGILL. P., with his pro-

to know whether it is intended to

with intent to extract information on
