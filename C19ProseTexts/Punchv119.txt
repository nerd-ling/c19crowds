AT the first touch of rosy-toed Aurora, the Imperial Maid had risen to the occasion, the same being unique. Its
m peculiar features were three ; and only two of them could ever meet again. First, it was New Year's Day; but
this recurs, roughly, with every thirteenth moon. Next, it was the opening of the New Century ; but every hundredth
year we may enjoy the repetition of this splendid event. Lastly, it was the day for proclaiming the Federation of
Australia ; and this could only happen once in the history of the world.
Fresh from a studied toilette, the Maid emerged into sunlight not more dazzling than herself. The air
was heavy with fortunate omens; the soil paved with spotless resolutions. Over these last lightly bounded her
faithful bodyguard, the kangaroo, always finding himself in one or other of his elements. Comely by grace of nature,
and dressed to distraction, she passed trippingly, yet with majesty, to the playing fields of Mars, a very Atalanta for
advance. As she assumed a posture of dignity at the saluting base, the punctual bugle rang; and at the head of his
troops forth rode the Veteran of Bouverie Street. Traces of pallor shewed about his cheek, for he had seen the New
Year in on native Burgundy, a wine that needs its Bush; yet was he full of movement, and mounted on a charger that
caracoled superbly.
Behind him marched the flower of Britain's chivalry, a specimen bouquet of all arms, spared from the long war-
harvest, and still leaving a few behind where they came from. Sabre, lance, and cuirass, those discredited tools of a
by-gone age, now relegated to pension and pageantry, shone bravely under a dazzling top-light. Onward they came, the
thousand and one knights, war-like infants, massed in quarter-column, and not a soul among them seeking cover.
So, with sword at the salute, the Veteran led his legions past our Lady of the Southern Cross.
Marked by a minimum of casualties, the Review was over. The Generalissimo had sheathed his blade, and
sprung to earth on bended knee before the Imperial Maid.
“Madam,” he cried, “we have brought you of our best to gild your peaceful pomp. Remains our debt of war,
the debt we owe for the strong arms you lent us at our need. And long may it remain unpaid in kind. Yet when, if
ever, you stand in just such need, doubt not the Great Mother will remember!
"Remote, indeed, must seem that peril on this day of days that binds her sons to one another (and, by
consequence, to her) with bonds not lightly to be loosed. There is a fable of a parent who called his sons together, and
shewing them a bundle of sticks—”

“I know it,” said the Maid, “I know it well. It keeps cropping up like the Chicago Phønix. Kindly pass on
to the next item."
“If,” replied the Veteran, “ you are already cognisant of this apposite illustration, I will waive it, and proceed
to drop into original poetry." And he pulled out a finely-engrossed parchment from up his tunic-sleeve. “Yet not
strictly original either"-he corrected himself—"for somewhat similar expressions have been attributed to a certain
Oriental Monarch whom our Only Dramatic Poet has lately popularised. But he was supposed to be mad at the time
(meaning Herod), whereas your obliged servant is nothing if not sane. With your permission ?”

“Thank you ; but may I take it as about to be read some other time, if you please?” said the Lady. “There is a good

“Madam,” replied the Veteran with much aplomb, “I had not actually foreseen this gracious interruption ; yet.

AGAIN you ask me, DAPHNE dear,
As looms in sight our short vacation,
Where shall we bend our steps this year
In quest of annual relaxation,
And find some sweet salubrious breeze,
Free from all taint of dire disease.
Then health reports by scores I scan,
Statistics of each spot comparing-

Before upon our journey faring,
And through the catalogue I run,
But to reject them, one by one.
Till, DAPHNE, but one place remains
(Since some defect mars all the rest of
them),
Where ever low the death-rate reigns,
One health resort, by far the best of
them ;
Yes, search the whole world, far and near,
You 'll find no place like London, dear.
Then still in London, DAPHNE, stay,
Where no unwholesome ills alarm you,
Let its perfections, day by day,
In health and vigour hold and charm you;

Must go to Paris after all.

AN (UNFINISHED) BALLADE OF MID-
SUMMER DAY AND NIGHT.
(JUNE 24, 1900.)
(With apologies to Mr. W. E. Henley.)
It's pouring in torrents, it's raining in
streams,
It's drenching the meadows, it's
drowning the hay,
The sun's ashamed of his wintry beams,
Midsummer Day! Midsummer Day!
The morning's sombre, the evening's
grey,
The sodden woods are a dismal sight,
The moon has a pallid, sickly ray,
Midsummer Night! O Midsummer Night!

The cuckoo in dumb depression dreams
of the horrible cold he has had since
May,
On the lawn the draggled peacock screams,
Midsummer Day! Midsummer Day!
The squirrels are far too wet to play,
The barndoor cocks are too wet to fight,
The barndoor hens are too wet to lay,
Midsummer Night! Ugh! Midsummer
Night!

said, “and do as I tell you."

pursuer's machine; at last its head-light
showed in the distance, as with greatly
diminished speed it began to climb the hill.
"Now!" shrieked CLARABELLA. -- “ Full

The automobile went backwards down
the hill like a flash of lighting. CUTTHROAT
had barely time to realise what was
happening before it was upon him. Too
late he tried to steer Black Jet out of
the way. There was a yell, a sound of
crashing steel, a cloud of steam. When

trifles (which to notice may be hypercritical), Mr. RUSSELL'S
style in this novel is easy, his characters are clearly defined,
and the dramatic situations so thoroughly stimulating as to
carry the reader on without a check from a good start to a
most satisfactory finish. The scene on the racecourse is capi.
tally described, and the excitement as to the race is kept up
in masterly style until the very last line of a first-rate chapter.
One most original character, to whom the reader must not
become too strongly attached, is the General's Chinese man-
servant. As far as the Baron is aware, this personage here
makes his first appearance in English fiction, though, of course,
in works of American humour the “ Heathen Chinee” is a very
old friend. That Fun Li (not a happy name) should have been
allowed to sneak out of the story, when he had been so amusing
and ornamental, is a distinct mistake which the Baron finds it
difficult to excuse. The explanation may be that the author
iz reserving this figure of fun for some future novel.
At any rate, it is to be hoped that we shall hear more
of Fun Li among the “ foleign devilee," and that it will

* PAYING THE PIPER.
LAST week a concert was given by the School Board, the pro-
gramme consisting of a portion of Judus Maccabæus. Lord
REAY, who presided, congratulated those present on the fact
that all performers were connected in some way with the
School Board. As the menu of the music was very successful,
it would seem almost ungracious to complain of the choice of
Handel in preference to other composers. In spite of this con-
sideration, it is obvious that there are a couple of items that
ought to be included in the next festival. “Where the money
goes” would make a most instructive “part” song, and no
concert of the School Board can be entirely appropriate with-
lout a setting of the song with the refrain of “Pay, pay, pay!"

you will remark in public that you don't
care to compete at these little local shows,
and your hearers will conclude that you
generously wish to give smaller growers a
chance of a prize. And if they choose to
assume that the flowers marked “not for
Wh

garden, that isn't your fault..
In order to keep up your reputation,
you must be careful wbat you say when
you are being shown round a friend's
garden. Never ask the name of a flower ;
it may be some quite common thing which
you ought to know. There is a regular
ritual to be observed on such occasions.
First, you dig your walking-stick into the
soil, and observe: “Ah, a nice useful
loam, I see." (This remark applies to
almost any soil, so it is quite safe.) Then
you may ask whether the wall has a south
aspect. “I should cut back those trees a
trifle more,” is another sentence which is
recommended. When your friend takes
you to inspect his roses, or grapes, or
cucumbers, your expression should indicate
tolerant approval. You will contrive to
suggest that, while these are all very well
in their way, they are vastly inferior to
those which you grow in your own gardin.
It is a good plan to learn up the Latin
names of a few common flowers. “Not a
bad specimen of Reseda odorata,” you
observe casually, pointing to your friend's
mignonette; and he is hugely impressed.
I will conclude with a few cultural notes

modelled on the style of those published
from time to time in ladies' journals, and
will be found quite as useful.) July is a

OUR CARNIVAL.
I DON'T know whether you could fairly
say that our Carnival at Dulwell was a
success or not. Anything in aid of the
Khaki Fund is sure of a succès d'estime,
and this was certainly not denied us.
Of course, it was not in our favour that a
heavy and persistent rain should have
fallen throughout the whole march of the
procession-nor was it conducive to en-
thusiasm that no one at the windows of
the houses could see anything of it, 'on
account of the torches refusing to light
up, in their wet and sodden condition.
On the wbole, it might have been worse-
but not much.
We had our preliminary meeting, to
settle the order of march, at the Vicarage.
The Mayor was to ride at the head of the
cortège, attired in Field-Marshal's uniform
-being extremely fat, string had to be
freely, employed in enlarging the lower
part of the chest of his red tunic, and as
he could not ride we were reluctantly
compelled to agree that he should go in
a gig. This, to my mind, rather took off
from a Field-Marshal's dignity: however,
the rest did not think so, and it was so
settled. Then Miss GUSHINGTON eagerly
volunteered to aid us. Speaking from
the back of the crowded room, she ex-
claimed: “I will go as Godiva-Minerva,
I mean!” she added with a shriek. She
meant well, but naturally we felt rather
-well-embarrassed, and for a minute or
two, no one bad any further suggestion
to offer. Then the Vicar came to the
rescue, and kindly said that he would
either carry a collecting box, attired in
the dress of the “Handy-Man” (he' is
the most unhandy man, I know), or form
one of the procession disguised as Colonel
of the New South Wales Lancers. As he
could supply his own mount-the white
chaise pony—the latter character was
finally chosen. Then came offers of
soldiers, sailors, ambulance men, hospital
nurses, military blacksmiths, the local
volunteer fire brigade, and one or two
allegorical cars. The meeting broke up
very pleased with itself, and we awaited
the eventful day in feverish expectancy
and busy preparation.

the gratifying reflection that they were
assisting the spread of civilization.
Soon, as it becaine clearer than ever
that poor Old CHINA was too feeble to
keep his own house in order, the six
Shopkeepers very kindly (for it was not
strictly in their line of business) arranged
to do it for him, each firm to undertake
a particular set of rooms.
But here a difficulty arose, because
every Shopkeeper wanted the best rooms
for himself, and they couldn't agree which
should have which, or whether their doors
should be open or closed to one another. I
Somehow Old CHINA managed to hear of
these disputes, which were not exactly
conducted in a whisper, and he mentioned
the matter to his sons, who attacked all
the representatives of the firms they could
find in the house and forced them to barri-
cade themselves in a cupboard.
Nothing could have been a greater
surprise to the Shopkeepers, who had
never imagined for a single moment that
Old Mr. CHINA could possibly be annoyed
by such a trifle, and were quite unpre-
pared at first to take any steps to rescue
the prisoners. Of course there was Mr.
JAPAN next door, who had got the better
of his neighbour before, and who was quite
ready now to get over the wall and compel
Old CHINA to set his captives free.
But one or two of the Shopkeepers didn't
care to be under an obligation to Mr.
JAPAN, and were afraid that he might
charge too heavily for his services. Be-

If you can see the creature blames
His keeper or his luck,
Try calling him endearing names-
An "angel " or a “duck.”
And he will love you (well he may !)
With love that does not cloy,
And all your life will fleet away
In happiness and joy.
Although his rind is rather thick,
His love you will not win
If you should beat him with a stick
or prick him with a pin.

“Not here," he replies. “You search

“WHERE TO GO.”
No. II.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, – Being still on the
look out, I rode to the next important
town we had put down on the list,
Sherrytounge, also in Norfolk. It was
the same style as Huntstayon: twenty
or thirty houses, of the West Kensington
build, erected on a field near the sea.
No old-fashioned hotel, so had to stay at
the Hotel Metafool, a gigantic house with
at least 200 bed-rooms. I was received
with some suspicion by the German
waiters, who ordered me to take my
bicycle round to the shed. I apologised
for being a bit dusty, but the head waiter
said it didn't matter; but I think it did,
for he took me to the far end of the
dining-room, so that I shouldn't be in
contact with the other guests, some of
whom were dressed as if they were going
to a ball. I asked if this were the case.
The waiter replied, “No but they like to
dress at the hotels. It makes a greater
change from their home life.”
The menu was the same as at the Shod-
dingham. Brown soup, brown sauce with
fish, entrée with brown sauce, &c. The
dinner was very expensive, and I told the
head waiter so. He replied, the class of
people they had there never complained,
and he couldn't see, himself, how it could
be cheaper, as they had recently spent
£5,000 on re-decorating the hotel. The
dining-room paper was certainly very fine.
It was a rich crimson and gold stamped
paper, in imitation of stamped leather,
the same as at the Shoddingham.
I had a bad night's rest; the bed-room
curtains, being made of some cheap flimsy
material, didn't keep out the light, and
the bed faced the window. Why do they
always place the beds facing the light?
I rode on to Crumer, which my wife said

distinguished category. We may be very
proud of Our Boys, so far, and, doubt-
less there are many more names that, for
the moment, escape the Baron's memory.
This story of Boy is simply charming. It
is true to life, genuinely humorous, and
powerfully pathetic. The poor little
chap's well - born, soddenly - drunken
father, and his "jelly fish ” of a mother
to whom “it was useless to talk about any-
thing but the merest commonplaces," are
convincing studies of character drawn to
the life by a masterly hand. These, the
evil genii of Boy, are admirably con-
trasted with the equally true types of
goodness, represented by the kind -
hearted, loving, faithful spinster, Miss
Letty, and ber honest, upright admirer,
Major Desmond, who is worthy to march
side by side with our dear old “Cod
Colonel," Thomas Newcome. Than this no
higher praise can be bestowed. The
juvenile hero of the tale runs great risk
of becoming a spoilt Boy. He will be in-
vited everywhere, fondled, petted by all.
He will be smiled upon, hugged, wept
over, taken up lovingly, again and again,
cherished and then parted with, for a time,
most reluctantly. Often, in years to come,
will he be brought down from his resting-
place in the library, to become acquainted
with new friends and admirers, or to be
welcomed by those in whose hearts the
memory of Boy will be ever kept green.
The Baron is inclined to pronounce this a
work of genius. As to its success, that

To-night became his duty to announce

result happiness. Annual income, twenty

those days. The solicitor appearing for
the prisoner, incidentally referred to the
District Messenger Boys in the course of
his remarks. He also urged that the
letter was important, as it contained a
cheque for a subscription in aid of a post-
man suddenly ill from overwork in hot
weather. Miss GOODHART, a lady of
ample means, with no temptations to
crime, had carried the letter herself to
avoid delay.
Official witnesses from the Post Office
stated in cross-examination that an
ordinary letter was conveyed from Bays-
water to Notting Hill in about 15 hours,
an express letter in 148 hours, and an
extra special express letter, with a fee of
five shillings, in 144 hours, supposing that
the compressed air motor postal van did
not break down on the way, which often
happened. In that case the letter would
be delivered within three days, but no
part of the five shillings would be re-
funded. A telegram requires nine hours.
A message by the electric-magnetic-hy-
draulic-pneumatic tube, provided the tube
is not blocked, can go sometimes in eight
hours.
The Magistrate said that these side
issues did not in any way diminish the
guilt of the prisoner. If persons so aban-
doned were allowed to break the law with
impunity, the British Empire would drift
into a condition of complete anarchy
resembling that of Germany or Russia. If
the Post Office were treated as an insti-
tution supported by public money for the
public benefit, instead of a magnificent
monopoly above all competition, the
British Empire would be tottering to its
fall. Nevertheless, in view of the
prisoner's age, and seeing also that it

inflict an unusually light punishment.

THE WASHING UP.
[“ New Australia, the socialist colony, which
started with such lofty ideals, has gone to pieces
upon the extremely vulgar question who was to do
the washing up."-Sydney Bulletin.]
To live for others, sinking self,
And deeming all the things of earth,
Rank, title, glory, honours, pelf
As nothing worth;
To share alike one common lot-
So, so we thought to drink the cup
Of happiness. Ah! we forgot
The washing up.
The dignity of labour—thus
The burden of our chorus ran-
This, this alone should stamp for us
The nobleman;
All should be equal, so they worked ;
But ah! when we would dine or sup,
We all invariably shirked
The washing up.

Ill

ROCCO
To take his brother by the hand,
And lead him on to higher states,
Was each man's wish. But none could
stand
The greasy plates.
Some even whispered, “Why not leave
Them on the ground? Some hungry pup
Will like them clean, and so achieve
The washing up.".
Ah me! that such a cause, so vain,
Should wreck so sweet and fair a dream!
Well, if we ever try again
A social scheme
Where all are equal in our view,
A maid, non-socialist, shall sup-
plement our household staff and do
The washing up.

You ask if we do not find yachting a very

quite a vintage flavour.

III.—THE “SCORCHER.”
“The scorcher,” you may loudly call,
“However groomed and cleaned,
Is not an animal at all,
Because he is a fiend.”
Your judgment does not trouble me
Or move me in the least,
Because on second thoughts you'll see
He really is a beast !
And therefore claims our kindness, so
We must, as you'll agree,
Allow our hearts to overflow
With love for such as he.
Reflect how many reasons for
Affection you can find,
He charges down upon you or
He catches you behind.
Perhaps he doesn't always ring
The necessary bell,
But he can give that useful thing,
A truly raucous yell.
What though the nervous invalid,
He frightens into fits ?
He energises such, indeed
He brightens up their wits.
For invalids must look alive,
And ladies skip about-
What other mortal could contrive
A hygienic shout ?
He kills a few? Perhaps, but stop!
I will not have him banned,
Considering the over-pop-
ulation of our land.
So do not prosecute bim when
He cycles on your toes,
But treat bim very kindly; then
Your conscience will repose. F. E.

FAREWELL, the City's roar! Farewell,

That emanates from dairy-farms.
I fling to any summer wind
The cares that warp my worldly breast,
And look with certitude to find
That cure of nature-balmy rest.
My palate craves no piquant spice,
No arts that titillate the town;
What need of Clicquot off the ice,
To wash the native cockerel down?
Full filled with milk (a generous tap)
I seck my chaste and timely bed,
And on the pillow's rustic nap
Depose a well-contented head.
I leave my little casement wide,
To catch, athwart the whispering

Some murmur of the country side,
Somnos quod invitet leves.
Out of my beauty sleep I start!
Was that the whirr of seraph wings?
I prick my ears; I hold my breath;
The room is full of flying things !
Bluebottles wanton on the pane;
Across my temple flits a bat;
Along my nose an organ-strain
Booms from a desultory gnat.
Above, the night-moth caracoles ;

An earwig tentatively strolls
About my sacred tympanum.

behind me evidently thought otherwise.

By the way, I think it would be good
policy to engage an interpreter at the
hotel to translate the menu, which-it
being an English hotel-was, of course,

My bedroom was gorgeously furnished,
but I took exception to the glare of the
electric light, which rendered reading in
bed an impossibility. There was a twenty-
five candle-power electric lamp hanging
above my head as I was lying down
reading. The glare was appalling, and
the heat from it was gradually frizzling
my hair; so the manager, a wonderfully
obliging gentleman, complied with my

I HAVE no lusty lance to bear before thee;

My legs are rather groggy at the knee;

I shrink from detonations on the line;

And, as I said before, my heart is thine.
I have no song, no stirring song, to send thee

I have no treasonable aid to lend thee,

Apart from war I so dislike the sea;
But though I rest in these immediate regions
My spirit (in a transport) flies to thee.

I have no flag of truce for fighting under,

And, lest my doctor may have missed
Some point, what I 'll propose is
That he shall have a specialist
To help his diagnosis.
But vain these cherished hopes, I stand
At present face to face
With a disease that's childish and
Extremely commonplace;
No very special drugs I need,
No powerful parcotic,
My malady is mild indeed
And most unpatriotic.

breathless style, which in this particular passage suggests a
quotation from one of 'MARK TWAIN's invaluable historical
works :-“ Meanwhile the King" (don't matter which, heaps
of 'em) “had another attack worse than ever. He was very
fierce, so that no one dared go near him, and refused to undress
or wash. This went on so long, and he got into such a dreadful
state, that the doctor said it must be stopped somehow. Ten
or twelve men, therefore, disguised themselves, wore armour
under their clothes and blackened their faces. Then they
rushed into the King's room. The King was so frightened that
he let them get close to him, and then they seized him, un-
dressed him, and washed him, and put. clean clothes on him.”

Supplied the reason which began the row;
That I, as primal cause of all the ill,
Should, so to speak, conduct the purging pill,
Since homeopathy demands of Us
To cure similia similibus.
Blind envy! 'Tis a vice, I dare to say,
To which I never yet have given way.
Enough that rigbtly, as it seems to Me,
The Powers insist on My hegemony;
Nor need I stoop to argue why they count
My claims (and Germany's) as paramount.
You go, Mein Graj, if not to guide the van,
At least to catch the hindmost, if you can.
And, even though unhappily you missed 'em,
I would not have you blame Our hallowed system.
We are a fighting nation, you must know,
That waits the KAJSER'S “ Are you ready? Go!"
Should war eventuate in foreign parts,
I press a button and the Army starts !
We boast, however distant be the sphere,
To reach the neighbourhood within the year!
In this superb mobility is seen
The beauty of a system-by-machine;
And here We leave, to My Imperial mind,
The amateurs of England far behind.
But now the solemn packing-hour has come,
And My emotions leave Me strangely dumb !
Farewell ! farewell! I print upon your face
A probably penultimate embrace.
To-night My Hohenzollern's band shall tune
A serenade to you beneath the moon.
To-morrow you will trickle toward the sea,
Taking my compliments to Italy.
I recommend Verona's balmy air:
It might be nice to break the journey there ;
The time would serve for getting into form
Against the Chi-li climate, which is warm.
Play bowls and croquet with your men; in short,
Foster a British love of martial sport.
Refreshed and rested, you will boldly creep
Across the dangers strewn about the deep;
And oh, I trust you may not run aground,
Or meet the other armies homeward-bound! 0. S.

Before you start on this momentous trip.
Bethink you, ere you board the restive train,
It is a chance may not occur again;
Bethink you what a time you have in store-
No prisoners ! no quarter ! simply gore !
I never, not in dreams, had nursed the hope
To give My mailëd fist so fine a scope.
My gallant troops through thirty years' increase
Have worn the honours incident to peace;
One test remained to prove their peerless might-
That they should actually go and fight !

To do an average ten knots an hour)-
If it can emulate that noble bark
On which My Royal Brother made his mark-
They should arrive in time to join the fray

Elected by a kind of cosmic voice ;

Hath not old custom made this car more sweet
Than Bishops' Palaces? Is not this third
More free from interruption than the court,
Where high and low, with wrathful wrangling, flock
To plague us with their pitiful disputes ?
Here feel we but the penalty of Cockneys,
The overcrowding ; as, the pungent plug
And heavy hob-nail of the working-man,
Which, when it stamps and grinds upon my toe,
Even till I shriek with pain, I smile and say-
No troubling brawlers these, no applicants
Who mar my peace that I may make their own,
But honest toilers on whose humble lot
A Bishop may perpend a homily.
Sweet are the uses of the Underground,
Which, like Avernus, black and sulphurous,
Hides yet the happy Islands of the Blest ;
And this my life, passed amid public haunts,
Finds tracts in trams, texts in the running 'bus,
Sermons in trains, and work in anything.

KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.
IV.-THE PERIWINKLE.
How callous are the “common herd"!
Their shell-fish ends to win,
The winkle oft is disinterred
With devastating pin.
I mean, uprooted from its shell
To crown a cruel feast;
But whether that be ill or well
They care not in the least.
And yet, perhaps, the winkle may
Possess a tiny soul,
And love to dream its life away
Where placid waters roll.
Perhaps a spark of poet fire
Imbues its tiny breast,
And can our brother man desire
To slay the sacred guest ?
Nay, rather let us all combine
To cherish, love, and train
This humble Offspring of the Brine,
This Tenant of the Main.
Then, it may answer to our care
And come when we shall call,
Its glad emotions we may share,
Its agonies and all.
Oh periwinkle, winkle on!
Our hearts with thine are one,
Thy fairy form we gaze upon
While cruelty we shun. F. E.

THE CUSTOMS CONGRESS.
AN International Congress, to consider
the best methods of simplifying all
Customs' formalities and regulations, met
in Paris last month, beginning its sittings
on July 30. One strictly private meeting,
held at the end of the Congress, has not
yet been reported.
A Swiss delegate said that the only
industry of his country was the tourist.
His countrymen lived upon tourists.
Therefore everything was done to en-
courage tourists. He advocated the
easiest regulations, if any were neces-
sary.
A German said he approved of all re-
gulations, instructions, official notices,
police orders, and so further. They were
indispensable, and were found in every
well-governed country. The better the
government, the more the regulations.
The Spanish delegate said they might be
useful if they did not interfere with the
comfort of the officials, and if they en-
couraged travellers to pay a few pesetas.
A Turkish gentleman here murmured
“Bakshish," and fell asleep again.
An English custom-house officer said the
remark was incomprehensible to him, as no
Custom-house officers understood foreign
languages. He did not know why the
previous speaker, whose remarks had been
translated to him, had advocated the pay-
ment of peas-eaters, by which he supposed
vegetarian officials were meant. For him-
self, he preferred honest beef and mutton,

were good things, but the glory of one's

excitement.
The gardens at Sans Souci, just outside Potsdam, are delight-
ful. Six long flights of steps lead up the terraces to the palace.
The enthusiast, at half-a-dozen palaces a day, must run up
them. The middleman, like myself, at three palaces, can stroll
gently up and watch the elderly female gardeners weeding the
borders. There are also male gardeners, but one can see them
elsewhere. One has some time to loiter in the gardens, since
one bas to run in the palaces. No sooner has the imperial
servant assembled the party than he starts at a brisk walk,
repeating his descriptions as fast as he can. Sometimes I tried
the simple device of asking a question ; but this only made him
hurry more afterwards, to make up for lost time.
I believe it is all owing to that charge for admission. When
one-especially if one is a frugal German-has paid threepence
to His Majesty WILLIAM I., German Emperor and King of
Prussia, one seems to have done enough. Moreover, the very
superior man in uniform who shows one round looks above a
tip. One could not offer threepence to him. At Sans Souci I
never thought of it. At the New Palace the imperial servant
seemed less unbending. As the party approached the exit, I
held a 50-pfennig piece in my hand. The rapidity with which
it passed into his showed me that, in spite of his uniform, he
was a mere man like myself.
In the Stadt Schloss, at Potsdam, my last palace for that day,
I was the only visitor. I had already seen two palaces, which
would be about my usual average for a whole year. I was
becoming satiated with palaces. Moreover, the afternoon was
warm. I longed to loiter. But the guide, in this case a woman,
would have none of it. She evidently wanted to run, though
she was by no means young, and all my lingering only reduced
her speed to about five miles an hour. Thus she led me,
breathless, through the rooms, containing, I believe, the books-
always French books—the dining-table descending through the

TO MY COLLAR STUD.
No pain majestic my brain can inspire,
No harmonies subtle I strike on my lyre ;
A commonplace subject is this that I touch,
But one that concerns me and worries me much.
Perhaps it may seem rather foolish to sing,
About such a very diminutive thing;
Perhaps I am dragging my Muse through the mud,
In mentioning you, little ivory stud.
I'm one of those rather unfortunate men
Who have to be up in the City by ten,
But many and oft are the mornings when I've
Slept peacefully on until eight forty-five.
A train I must catch at a quarter-past nine,
And I've an objection to running it fine;
With dressing and breakfast there's plenty to do,
It's really too much to be hindered by you.
But that's the occasion on which you will fix
To show off your most diabolical tricks;
Directly you see me approaching your lair,
For violent action at once you prepare.
Your cosy retreat I begin to explore,
And seizing your chance you slip down on the floor,
Then over the carpet you silently roll
To some inaccessible corner or hole.
Oh, evil the passions that you can create,
For I am reduced to a terrible state;
I'm rather short-righted, and loudly I curse
(My sight may be bad, but my language is worse).
I can't do without you, as doubtless you know,
But vainly I search for your shape, high and low;
Your fiendish skill all my agility mocks,
And wildly I dash round the room in my socks.
I shake out my garments, I grovel and grope,
It's close upon nine and I give up all hope ;
But just as the clock points to five minutes past,
In one of my boots you 're discovered at last.
I finish my toilet, five minutes remain,
My breakfast I bolt on the way to the train;
Then pangs of acute indigestion ensue-
Another misfortune that's owing to you.
And during the day my acquaintances find
That I'm not at all in a nice frame of mind ;
Of course they will get upon quite the wrong track
In putting it down to a liver attack.
Though kindly disposed before leaving my bed,
I'm grumpy and most discontented instead ;
My good resolutions are nipped in the bud,
And you are the cause, you diminutive stud!

And shrieks our life away."

THE TABLETS OF AZIT-TIGLETH-MIPHANSI, THE SCRIBE.
Professor HILPRECHT, Scientific Director of the American Expedition, has discovered at Nippur, in Babylonia, an entire library containing probably
160,000 tablets of remote antiquity, and of the greatest historical interest. As it must of necessity take time before authorised translations of these can
be given to the public, our artist has decided to give them a few samples to begin with. His knowledge of the cuneiform character is not extensive,
but he has done his best.

the kind of place one sees in a Christmas
Number picture, though it was rather
overlooked by a high building which I
thought a pity to have built so close to
such a pretty old house.
A lady and her son showed me over the
premises, and I must say the interior was
as attractive as the exterior. I think, per-
haps, I exhibited too much keenness and
approval, for the mother said I should have
to pay a deposit of £5 as she didn't know
me, and she had half promised an American
family the letting. I gave her £5 and she
said she guarantee the rooms should be
kept for me. Having at last been success-
ful, I wired the result to my wife, and
told her I should return home by the 6.50
train. I felt, after my success, I was
justified in dining comfortably at the
Commercial Hotel, which I did in com-
panionship of several pleasant commercial
travellers.
We shared a bottle of very good port,
and afterwards played a game of pool, at
which I lost half a sovereign. However,
that is neither here nor there. Without
being facetious, I may say it's not here.
They asked me if I was “ on the road,"
and I replied, “Yes, on the road to seek
farm-house apartments,” and was happy
to say I had been most successful.
They all knew the neighbourhood well,
but when I mentioned Appledore Farm, I
observed they looked at each other and
whistled. I asked what was the matter.
One of them said, “What price Lavender

I took it good-naturedly, and said, “I
suppose, gentlemen, you wish to convey
to me that the house is haunted; but
neither myself nor family will be frightened
at a ghost."
One said, “It wasn't the question of a
ghost; it was more a matter of bones;”.
and, on pressing him for an explanation,
it was explained to me that, though
Appledore Farm was a most charming
place, the big building close to it was a
bone factory, where bones from the
butchers for miles round were being
boiled down all day long.

of carpet, must not be scratched by plebeian boots. All of us,

CHAPTER I.
'Twas dewy eve. Into the dear old
garden the lovers strolled, his arm round
her waist, her fair tresses glowing in the
radiance of the setting sun, just in the
good old way it used to be before financial
novels were so much as thought of.
“Now, tell me," she cooed, love con-
fessed in every syllable; “tell me, HENRY,
where you have been to-day.”
“I have been," said HENRY, solemnly,
"in the Kaffir circus."

ALISM
A SOCIETY NOVEL.
By our Mr. Jabberjee.
PRELIMINARY NOTICE.
I HAVE the honour humbly to inform readers of Punch that,
after prolonged consumption of midnight oil, I have composed
a novel of imposing dimensions, which is shortly, by the indul-
gence of my friend and kind father, the honble Editor, to be
laid at their feet in the columns of this respectable journal.
My inducement to this enterprise was the spectacle of very
inferior rubbish palmed off by so-called popular novelists such
as Honbles KIPLING, JOSHUA BARRIE, ANTONY WEYMAN, STANLEY
HOPE, and the collaborative but feminine authoresses of The
Red Thumb in the Potter's Potash, all of whom profess (very, very
incorrectly) to give accurate reliable descriptions of Indian,
English or Scotch episodes.
The pity of it, that a magnificent and gullible British Public
should be fed like a babe on such spoonmeat and small beer!
And when the dawn of the Twentieth Century, too, is ad-
vancing upon us with leaps and bounds!
Would no one arise, inflamed by the pure enthusiasm of his
cacoethes scribendi, and write a romance which shall secure the
plerophory of British, American, Anglo-Indian, Colonial, and
Continental readers by dint of its imaginary power and slavish
fidelity to Nature ?
And since Echo answered that no one replied to this invita-
tion, I (like a fool, as some will say) rushed in where angels
were apprehensive of being too bulky to be borne.
Being naturally acquainted with gentlemen of my own
nationality and education, and also, of course, knowing London
and suburban society ab ovo usque ad mala (or, from the new-
laid egg to the stage when it is beginning to go bad), I de-
cided to take as my theme the adventures of a typically
splendid representative of Young India on British soil, and

CLARISSA ! do not deem it strange
That in this temporary lull,
When business on the Stock Exchange
Is, truth to tell, extremely dull,
My fleeting fancy should suggest
A higher kind of interest.
For monetary matters pall,
And at the present time I hate
To seriously think at all
Of stocks and shares that fluctuate ;
But when I turn to you, my own,
My thoughts assume a steady tone.
Consols may fall, Home Railways rise,
Industrials pay cent. per cent.,
But I shall not express surprise
At any unforeseen event;
Let me forget, while I've the charice,
The wild vagaries of finance.
A queen of womankind you are,
And when to visit you I come,
My spirits quickly rise from par
To a substantial premium ;
I'm sure, CLARISSA, you must be
A valuable security.
At times a weird and horrid dream
Flits through my money-grubbing head,
That somebody has got a scheme
For rendering you “Limited”;
Just fancy, if they dared to float
The only girl on whom I dote !
All your advantages would be
In a prospectus then displayed,
(The charm of your society
Is quite sufficient stock in trade),
And public enterprise would yearn,
To take up such a safe concorn,
But when the list was open, I :
Should leave my commonplace affairs,
And, blowing the expense, apply
For all the newly-issued shares;
Oh, I sincerely hope, my pet,
The full allotment I might get.
Enough! I'll drive these fancies hence,
My agitation is absurd ;
While you display a preference
All gloomy doubts may be deferred ;
You will, before the month is past,
Be irredeemable at last!

Season-on-sea. If this be a holiday-well, it's not my idea of
one. Why not bring out opera singers, and powdered footmen
in livery, butler and major-domo? No, thank you. And then
the rules and regulations all set forth, severely printed on large
formal cards, and stuck up conspicuously in every cabin, as
though you were on board a P. & O. steamer, where, of course,
such rules and regulations are as essential as they are on a
railway, or in a first-class hotel.
Is life worth living in holiday time if you have to be up every
day at a certain time; awakened by bugle to breakfast at a
fixed hour; to lunch ditto; to dress every evening, as if you
were going to the opera or a dance, and then when “the
sweetest morsel of the night” approaches, and you gather round
a small table or two in the smoking-room on deck to talk,
smoke, exchange experiences, tell and hear good stories and
drain a cheery nightcap, to know that at some unearthly and
unsealike hour such as 11.30 or 11.45 p.m. the electric light is
to be inexorably turned out, and the convives have to follow
the example of lights and to go out altogether, or one after

ABOARD THE “KAISER WILHELM DER GROSSE."
Was ho, meine Herzliche! I doubt if this be the correct
translation of “What ho, my hearties !” but it may do to say
at Bremerhaven when I ship myself all aboard of the great ship
with the long name. What a name! The White Star and Cunard
lines are satisfied with names of one word; the Union-Castle
with two words. Why, then, four words ? When the Norddeut-
scher Lloyd launches a new ship, longer and more luxurious if
that be possible, she might be called Seine Majestät Friedrich
Wilhelm Victor Albert Deutscher Kaiser und König von Preussen.
With a little practice you might say this in one breath, as you
say Oceanic.
I know but few English nautical expressions, and the meaning
of even these is a mystery to me. But I might safely try some
German nautical phrases, if I knew any, on a very short and
very fat German landsman whom I meet the evening before our
start.
In the hotel restaurant he seats himself, uninvited, at a table
occupied by an American and myself, thereby showing himself
ignorant of the customs of his own country. And further, also
without invitation, he confides his private affairs to us. It is
surprising to hear that he, a well-to-do man of five and thirty
perhaps, has never seen the sea. He comes from Wiesbaden.
But, he tells us proudly, he has been in steamers on the Rhine.
We assure him the North Sea is much wider than the Rhine.
We hold out to him the awful prospect of a gale on the next
day, in which case he will embark up the river at Bremerhaven,
go all the way to Cherbourg shut up in his cabin, crawl ashore
in the harbour there, and never see the sea after all.

When days were warm and skies were blue,

Volumes of good advice instead.

“ Treating the wives of electors, in order
to influence their husbands to vote, is an
offence." So he who would represent his
fellow man in Parliament must avoid tête-
à-tête lunches with the fellow man's wife.
The law raises an objection to the practice.
And here I may remark that the objection
probably would be shared by the fellow
man quâ husband.
Baron POLLOCK, in the St. Ceorge-in-the-
East Election Petition, condemned the
practice technically known as “ standing
drinks." His lordship expressed his
regret that the candidate should frequent
taverns to ingratiate himself. He even
went so far as to suggest that it was a
matter to deplore " that a candidate should
ever be seen in a public house." He added,
however, with a fine appreciation of the
failing incident to human nature, “he
should not be seen in the public house,
except where it is absolutely necessary."
Of course, requisite refreshment should
be obtained at second, not first, hand. But,
of course, there may be cases where a visit
to a tavern is “absolutely necessary"-
say in very hot weather, and these excep-
tional cases Baron POLLOCK recognised.
“Candidates are bound by the actions of
their agents, and consequently should be
careful in their selection of their repre-
sentatives.” At Montgomery—although
there was a division of forensic opinion-
the judges seemed to consider that an
agent who, when “in his cups,” treated
nearly everyone he came across was not
a suitable person for selection. They laid
it down “ that the reprehensible selection
ought to recoil upon those who had been
guilty of such culpable carelessness."
Any right-thinking man will agree with
the judges. A person who would “in

German troops should rendezvous at Wai-
Ting, and then advance on the Eastern
gate of the city, but when the British
arrived outside the walls, they found the
Germans there before them, and already
in possession. The soldiers of the Father-
land received them, standing at attention,

British retired, rather annoyed at being
thus anticipated.
When the Western gate was to be
stormed, it was agreed that the British,
Japanese and Russian forces should
advance together, to make a night attack.
In the darkness, however, the different
contingents became separated, and upon
our troops arriving at the gate as day
broke, they found the Russians had stolen
a march upon them, and were already
drawn up to receive them in parade order,
headed by General ORFULKORF, each
soldier saluting in true Russ fashion, with
his thumb placed firmly on his most
prominent Slav feature, and the fingers
well stretched out.

LOVE-SONG FOR THE AUTUMN.
In early Spring the snowdrop peeps
With gandy crocus-blossom lined,
And soon the Lenten lily leaps
To life in golden glory shrined.
Lilac, laburnum, primrose, may,
Reveal their beauty. Still I'm dumb.
For ev'ry flower there is a day,
And so for my Chrysanthemum !
The Summer splendour of the rose,
The brave carnation's varied hue,
Will shame the orchid where it blows,
And dim the massed lobelia's blue;
The fuschia's purple bell is fain
To match the pelargonium,
But royal tints would try in vain
To paint my sweet Chrysanthemum !
When leaves are stricken by the blast,
Or quiver 'neath a fickle sun,
And beeches shed their prickly mast,
And holly reddening has begun,
The violet lurks beneath its green
Beside the staunch nasturtium,
Where some poor blighted rose is seen,
Then reigns my fair Chrysanthemum !

I cried, “Do you anticipate

to say a few words of my opponent. I
chanced to see him enter his committee-
room to-day. For perhaps fifteen seconds
he stood in the full glare of my inductive
glance. What did those fifteen seconds
reveal ? That he makes a false income-tax
return, does not pay his tailor's bill, eats
bacon without mustard, collects postage-
stamps, only writes to his aged mother on
the second Monday in each month, is an
anti-vivisectionist, and is suffering from
over-indulgence in baked potatoes ! (Sen-
sation.) Yes, that was what I learnt in
fifteen seconds. But soon I hope to study
him for a full minute, and then, gentlemen,
you shall know the result! (Laughter and
cheers.) But in the light of what the most
simple inductive process has demonstrated
already, is such a man, I ask you con-

MR. SWINBURNE S'AMUSE.
SIR,- In the Athenæum—a paper I greatly

In the last week of August appeared, as

A matter of two or three columns of verse

And I read them and felt that I also could
write like that if I tried.
It was Mr. SWINBURNE who wrote thein,
and this was the metre he used.
The words and the rhymes were there all
right, but the thought was confused,
And the lines went rippling along and the
columns melted away,
And the poet sang on, sang on; but, alas,
he had nothing to say !

I said, “I will write Mr. Punch,

Note.-The MacBRAYNE officials, as I may have previously
remarked, on the steamboats, are quite models of “Civil
Servants,” but protracted acquaintance with the MACBRAYNE
fleet Icompels me to say that these vessels are capable of
considerable improvement. And this improvement, too, could
with great advantage be extended to the catering, which, good
of its kind, is very commonplace and monotonous. The bill of
fare on any one steamer is the same on all, and it seems to be
more and more the same the oftener you travel by a DAVID
MACBRAYNE steamer. With the exception of one or two half-
hearted oppositions with inferior boats, the MACBRAYNE has
practically the monopoly. It's a “One Man one Boat"
business. It ought not to be. The business is with very rare
exceptions admirably managed, and the attention given by the
MACBRAYNES at Head-quarters to any just representation is
immediate and just. And of this I speak from personal experi-
ence. Yet, no government, however popular, can be a success
without a strong opposition. The sooner MALCOLM, MACINTELLECT,
MACENTERPRISE & Co. start against DAVID MACBRAYNE, the
better for the public service and ultimately the better for
DAVID MACBRAYNE, unless DAVID should prove himself a
Solomon by anticipating the reform boldly but not rashly.
Why never a change in the menu ? Granted, that for break-
fast at 8.30 you can't improve to any considerable extent such
“ general-utility” dishes as eggs and bacon, eggs -and ham,
fresh herrings, some other fish, and marmalade for a finish.

snapped abruptly and flew across the boudoir ; but she gave no
other sign of the internal shock that she had sustained.
“And mine," she replied, as she collected the fragments with
perfect aplomb, “mine is–Lord FLOTSAM." She was a gifted
woman. The lie had a superb air of probability.
“Have you tried playing Patience, dear?” said BIEN-EXTENDUE,
very gently. “The' Demon' is so good for the nerves. I often
say to myself,” she added, with a woman's tact for easy
digression, “ that life is indeed a school for saints. I do so
dislike schools for saints. They sound like convents, and seem
so French. Poor dear ALFRED was very English, you know."
“ There ought only to be boys' schools for saints," said
TARARA-ETC.; " and yet," with a sudden fury, “I could be as
pious as a Vestal if a man's love was to be got by it. Ah!
Bah!”
“I should think Lord FLOTSAM must be a very beautiful
character," said BIEN-ENTENDUE, innocently.
2157.-TO ROBERT it was a matter of heart-searching that his
sense of MIDGET's nearness varied inversely with her physical
proximity. Thus, when she was a hundred miles away, he
would inadvertently order dinner for two; but when he
actually kissed her, as on the exceptional occasion of their
betrothal, it seemed that she was almost round the corner of
the next street. This gave a certain remoteness to his em-
brace, which still was recorded on the sensitive tablets of his
conscience as a desecration. A little more of this strain and
his taste for humour would have been permanently impaired.
22ND TO 24TH.-FLOTSAM, indeed, was uneasy about the mar- |
riage. To him the undivided devotion of his select circle was
a thing too sacred to be lightly disturbed. To a friend who
once reminded him that it is more blessed to give than to
receive, he replied that in the case of true friendship he was

| circumstances,' he said, and from that ground he would not
budge.” Some relief from the puerility of the book is found in
the illustrations, which, taken on the spot, are occasionally in-
teresting. It is a pleasure to turn from this vaporous perfor-
mance to Captain HALDANE's story, the high merit of which my
Baronite hastened to recognize when it appeared in the magazine.
Jezebel (HUTCHINSON) runs beyond the average length of the
6s. vol., which, happily in some cases, shows a tendency towards
decrease in bulk. The variation is welcome, for the volume is
good from beginning to end. It opens with a striking episode;
it works up to, and finely closes with, a dramatic passage.
There are a multitude of characters, all flesh and blood. My
Baronite knows Miss DESTER. He sat with her at breakfast a
short time ago, at a meet of the hounds not far from the cottage
where GEORGE MEREDITH lives his placid life. She was dressed
in the “rough garments designed by herself, and executed by a
tailor in the village." In Town everybody knows Lady
MARGARET ARLINGTON, with her shrewd ways, her kind heart,
and her neglect of the final “g” in common words. My Baronite
pointedly refrains from even hinting at the plot or the passion
of Mr. RICHARD PRYCE's last novel. But it's worth getting.
But for certain episodes, absolutely unnecessary, but generally
described by an English reader as “peculiarly French," the
Baron would strongly recommend to all lovers of the sort of
sensational romance whereof the immortal Count of Monte
Cristo is the most popular type, a story, which, in spite of
its melodramatic character, is not devoid of humorous
scenes and characters by EUGÈNE CHAVETTE, in two volumes,
of which the first is entitled La Veuve Rossignol, and the
second La Cléopâtre (Flammarion, Éditeur, Paris); though
it would have been better to have included both under some
such title as Le Trésor de Calrap, or the more popular one of
Les Trois Frères.

wearing a heavy moustache that not so very many years ago

[" Where they do agree .... their unanimity

SAY not that we entered the battle
Discordant with casual cries,
With the various polyglot rattle
That Babel addressed to the skies ;
Say not that we came to our task with
Competitive tunes for our toes,
With the militant Fife of an ASQUITH,
The peace-loving pipes o' MONTROSE.
Do not mention the curious manner
In which we combined for attack,
With the fugitive Hollanders' banner
Pinned on to the jubilant Jack;
Do not mention the way that we camped
on
The field of our ultimate doom
With the guns of our Ladysmith LAMBTON
In line with the Mausers of OOM.
Though apparently riven asunder,
We jointly adopted the view
That the War was a crime or a blunder;
The question was—which of the two?
For the Torics had gone for our“ brothers"
With openly cynical eyes,
Or were napping (according to others)
And taken by vulgar surprise.
If there was any personal faction
That marched to a separate band,
It was drowned by our war-cry in action
Unanimous, fluty and grand !
Ignoring debateable notions--
Home Rule, Local Drink, and the rest-
It appealed to the primal emotions
That lurk in the average breast.
That cry of the Party en bloc, Sirs,
Our Leaders were proud to endorse ;
It was used by the Battersea Boxers
With singular feeling and force;

ODE TO A LIBERAL MOCKING-BIRD.
[With acknowledgments to the late KEATS, and respectful
compliments to F. C. G. of the “Westminster Gazette."']
OUR brain aches and a torpor numbs our nerve
As though with opiates we were deep imbrued,
Being apparently condemned to serve
A second shift of penal servitude;
And we must envy thee thy happier lot,
Gay-hearted Dryad of the trenchant plume,
Who still upon the post-meridian breeze
In thy green-tinted plot
Amid the Opposition's ambient gloom
Chaffest the Tory with thy usual ease.
O for a drink of water such as cools
The Liberal larynx torrid on the stump,
Smacking of Cockermouth's perennial pools,
Of WIL, ID LAWSON and the village pump !
O for a taakard full of H,O,
The true, the proletarian Hippocrene,
With Local Veto winking at the brim
And filtered mirth below;
That haply we might hop about the scene
With thy sublime agility of limb:
Hop as our heart dictates, and quite ignore
What thou hast missed this many a summer-tide,
The weariness, amounting to a bore,
Of being always on the stronger side ;
Where fat and callous-eyed indifference rusts
Even the Tory Blood's incisive blade:
Where humour's bolt is evermore discharged
At unresisting busts;
And wit that works by opposition's aid
Dies of a liver borribly enlarged.
Frankly, immortal Bird, for five long years
We had a presage we should die that way,
And now the country's voice confirms our fears
Almost allowing us to fix the day;
Now more than ever longingly we dream
Of times when Victory flushed the Liberal camp,
And there was ploughing in the sandy ruts ;
Of ROSEBERY, grateful theme,
Of HARCOURT on the vulnerable ramp,
And all the vista lined with obvious butts.
For thee, a like regret would seem absurd ;
No vast majorities depress thy brain ;
Thou hast (if one may say it of a bird)
Thy faithful subjects in the Powers that reign.
Perhaps the self-same art in days by-gone
Tickled the ribs of JOSEPH's brother-band,
When, o'er a coat of many patterns blent
His pictured optic shone
Through comic casements opening on the land
Of Goshen, where he ran the Government.
The Government! The word is as a knell
Tolling us back to dulness of the Pit,
While thou art happy in another spell
Of the old hope forlorn that whets the wit;
There is thy JOSEPH, hewn a hundred times,
And, like Valhalla's warriors, fresh as paint !
Ah! in thy gallant fight against the gods,
Pity our bloodless rhymes,
That fall on hollow squadrons, pale and faint,
With never a chance to front the frowning odds!

the only, great after-dinner speaker left
to us. It is much easier to deliver a
ponderous discourse in Parliament than it
is to make an after-dinner speech which
shall be wise as well as witty, lambent
with flashes of humour but never degene-
rating into flippancy. To achieve this
success a keen, yet chastened, sense of
humour is indispensable. This Lord ROSE-
BERY has in abundance. In polished
phrases, often exquisitely turned, he
sometimes bridges the distance between
Humour and its more stately elder brother
Wit.
Imbued with this saving grace of humour,
Lord ROSEBERY is easily and naturally
moved to pathos. Think of the little aside
in his speech on the death of Mr. GLAD-
STONE which touched even the House of
Lords—an assembly the late Lord CCLE-
RIDGE vividly described when he said he
never spoke in it without feeling as if he
were in a churchyard addressing the tomb-
stones. Language had been exhausted
in eulogy of the great statesman and in
lamentation at his cutting off. Only Lord
ROSEBERY thought of “the solitary and
pathetic figure who, for sixty years shared
all the sorrows and all the joys of Mr.
GLADSTONE's life.”

to shoot, to be an Admiral, to change my
uniforms, to sit for photographs, to write
State-papers, to govern my Empire in every
department, and to make jokes with my
family. What says the poet ?-

will
Es ist nichts so fein gesponnen, es kommt doch an die

On these principles, so gloriously ex-
pressed by our immortal SCHILLER, I have
always acted, and the result is before the
world. My uniforms are kept in a large
hall a thousand feet square, where they
hang from specially-constructed pegs like
the harness of horses in the fire brigade.
All I have to do is to stand under a uni-
form, press a button and the clothes fall
round me in an instant. I often spend
an hour or so in amusing myself in this
way. It is quite a mistake to suppose
that anyone helps me with my pictures and
poems. I do them quite by myself. I will
here quote from one of my hundred best
poems :-
Der Deutsche Kaiser ! hoch! hoch! hoch!
Und hoch! hoch! hoch! der Deutsche Kaiser.
My meals are simple: a dish of soup, a
turbot, a pheasant or two, a sirloin of
beef, a boar's head (shot by me on the
same day), a dudelsack (a native dish, very
appetising) and a selection of sweets
washed down with native champagne -
such is my plain daily fare. After dinner
is over, the latest batch of arrested
editors is brought into my presence.
They are then set to fight one another,

wholesale grocers. On his annual visit to
Scotland he resumes the family name and
becomes The MCTAVISH, tout court.)
There being no otters in the Thames in
the neighbourhood of Westminster Bridge,
my personal acquaintance with their
appearance and habits is merely nominal.
On looking up the authorities, I was
gratified to learn that, to a certain extent,
my ignorance was shared by LINNÆUS.
That eminent man classed the otter with
the weasel. He was, of course, wrong.
The weasel, which rarely sleeps, lives
inyariably on the land. The otter is, chez
lui, in the water. The otter (lutra) has
eighteen teeth in each jaw, of which, J
regret to say, twelve are false molars.
The feet are palmated and the tail flattened
horizontally. The otter is about two feet
in length to the insertion of the tail,
which is sixteen inches long. It is brown
above, whitish around the lips, on the cheek
and beneath. When properly trained it
becomes very useful, a single otter being
capable of supplying a large family with
fish.
In view of the necessity of formulating
ministerial policy in a new Parliament,
here lurks a hint for Don JOSÉ. Prevented
by circumstances, including a hard-fisted
Chancellor of the Exchequer, from realis-
ing his beneficent dreams of Old Age
Pensions, why not formulate a scheme for
supplying the deserving poor with the
means of obtaining a free breakfast table
of fish? “One man one otter," would
overdo the thing, even as an electioneer-
ing cry. But an otter per household, say
of seven, would be a great boon to the
working classes. “Our Young Queen and
our Old Constitution," was a potent
political cry sixty years ago. “A Free
Otter and Fresh Fish "might, at the close
of the century, work equal charm.

on which the sun shed fresh glory.
Suddenly, in front, where the huntsmen
led the hounds, there was an outburst of
angry cries, broken by the cracking of a
whip. “They're on to the drag,” eagerly
whispered the crowd, pressing forward at
the run. They were indeed. But what
they had found was not an otter.
It was The MCTAVISH !
That ardent Highlander, getting ahead
of everybody, and finding near the bridge
convenient access to the river, descended
and was conducting an otter hunt on his
own account. It was a critical moment
with the eager hounds, who seemed
to have got on the drag. And here was
The McTavish in front, at the bend of the
river, poking his stick into holes as if he
were a chiffonier. The huntsman, happily
on the other bank, yelled and cracked his
whip. “Get behind the hounds!" roared
the crowd.
We found no otter through the three
hours' hunt that followed. But the sight
of The MCTAVISH, with pale face and firmly
set teeth, clambering up the steep bank
amid yells of execration, was worth the
outing.

THE COMPLAINT OF THE SPOOK.
[According to the the Daily Telegraph of
October 23, spiritualists and their disembodied De
friends have lately been protesting at Professor
Dewar's experiments with air at low temperatures,
whereby sundry stray spooks have been caught and
solidified along with the atmosphere. As a result
of their ignominious incarceration, several hitherto
well-affected spirits have threatened to emigrate to
a climate where a less pressure is brought to bear
upon them.]

AFTER VACATION.
Dear Mr. PUNCH, -Yon, who are the
friend of the young, can, I think, spare a
thought from your cares to the freshmen
lately folded to the breast of Cambridge
or of Oxford. From all quarters of the
world have they taken their way, some
with high ideals of the little life they are
to live within those grey and venerable
walls, some with thoughts of a chappy
time relieved of the incubus of school-|
masters, and exalted by the possession of
a cheque-book and a moderate balance at
the bank. But they are all freshmen,
youngster upon whom trials and troubles
have set no defacing mark, gay, light-
hearted, shy and unspoiled in mind, in
heart, and it does a veteran good to live
with them, even though it be merely in
imagination, for a moment.

CHILDE JOSEPH'S PILGRIMAGE.
. So on his pilgrimage forth fared the Childe
To represent Britannia's awful sway ;
His vessel--not that ship from CÆSAR styled,
Which should embark him down Gibraltar way,
Yet big with CÆSAR's fortune-ploughed the Bay
In the unnumbered wake of homing swallows;
Stoutly he lit a great cigar and lay
Contemptuous of Biscay's hoary hollows,
And with his naval son and heir conversed as follows:
Now he returns to fill his native niche,
Skirting the course of KRÜGER'S pilgrim feet,
Free to admit that there were points on which
He proved his local knowledge incomplete ;
Filled full with culture as an egg with meat,
And radiant with the art of antique Rome;
Yet, in respect of things like Downing Street,
Convinced that one may find, across the foam,
No place, however humble ours may be, like home!
(0. S.
“ AUSTEN, my boy! bright image of my self !
Now are we launched upon the lusty main;
Free from the gripe of politics and pelf
We may awhile repose the fevered brain
With scraps of some old nautical refrain;
With thoughts of Nelson, that ennobling theme,
Suggested by the adjacent map of Spain;
Till JESSE be forgotten as a dream,
And HOSKINS fade into an unpromoted scheme !"
Behold Gibraltar's bare and beetling rock,
Its adamantine base with billows wet,
Chip of the Empire's earth-compelling block
On which the sun is impotent to set!
What passions in the hero's bosom fret
As, on the Governor's arm, he scales the height
Burrowed with bastions! How should he forget
KYNOCHS and POWELL, faithful parasite,
Under a bushel doomed to douse his public light?
Soon with reluctant feet they quit the land,
Noting the pillars named of Hercules,
Europe and Africa on either hand,
And Britain throned on all the sundering seas.
Now Malta's cannon shake her martial quays,
Thrice favoured atom of that mighty whole

Which, thanks to Heaven and his (the Childe's) control,
Stretches in one harmonious mass from pole to pole!
HINTS ON MAKING ONESELF THOROUGHLY
OBJECTIONABLE.
“PRACTICE," says the proverb, “makes perfect!” And the
compiler of these hints wishes to impress this point on his
readers, urging them not to be discouraged if their efforts
do not meet with all the success they could wish for at the
first attempt. Perseverance and assiduous attention to the
object they have in view, namely, the exasperation of their
fellow men, will surely triumph in the end.
1.--IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE.
This is a very good place for the novice to experiment in.
First of all, to avoid any possibility of your operations being,
so to speak, nipped in the bud and brought to an untimely
end, it is advisable to select a long-distance train, and one
that does not stop for, at least, an hour after leaving the
terminus. Be at the station some time beforehand, and try to
find a compartment in which all four corner seats have been
secured by means of rugs, umbrellas, or newspapers, placed in
them. Having satisfied yourself that the legitimate occupier
of one seat is engaged at the other end of the platform,
looking after the luggage, you proceed to remove his belongings
up into the hatrack. Then you occupy the seat yourself. To
ensure complete success at this stage, you should be of the
feminine gender and call yourself a lady; in which case the
exasperated individual, whose place you have taken, cannot
very well resort to brute force just as the train is starting.
The atmosphere of that compartment will thus, you see, be
already nicely disturbed. I would mention in passing, that
you should have supplied yourself with a number of large
packages, “too fragile to go in the van," with which you can
fill up all the gaps between yourself and the other occupants of
the carriage. I would particularly suggest that you place some
on the floor, so as to cramp the nether limbs of your fellow
passengers. All these little things help.
If it is summer time, a large posy of gaudy flowers, freshly
gathered from your back garden, is to be strongly recmomended
as an addition to your other parcels. This will probably result
in one or two earwigs being discovered, and will also attract
any stray wasps that may be passing the windows.
The true artist should never overdo things. The impression
you have created will last for some little time now, without
further effort on your part. You may, however, derive some
amusement from the carriage windows, particularly the one on
your side. Study the taste of your fellow passengers as regards
fresh air, and endeavour to do exactly the opposite to what
they would wish, by lowering or raising the windows. P. G.
At length, eluding Scylla's loathéd wiles,
The urgent keel of Cæsar (H.M.S.)
Glides by the fiery Liparæan isles,
And on to Naples' azure bay, express.
And here the Childe in unofficial dress
Samples the cafés and the dim Duomo ;
But no incog. can hide his courtliness,
Though some mistake him for milord SELOMO,
So fine a modesty adorns our novus homo !
“ Napoli! Napoli!” (thus JOSEPH cried,
Scanning the plain with glassy eagle eye,
While from the crater in a steady tide
The sulphuretted lava floated by),
“ City that ROSEBERY saw and wished to die !
Thou art Italia's pride, our only love!
Such hatred we provoke--I wonder why;
Are some of us too near the powers above ?
Or does the New Diplomacy too rudely shove?"
Anon he courses down the Sacred Way
In cabs by moonlight, calm and self-possessed;
It is a scene, though viewed in vulgar day,
That leaves the thoughtful tourist much impressed ;
There to his listening son the Childe addressed
Remarks on Rome and ruin ; how she lacked
What might have served to stay the Gothic pest-
A gift for federation ; missed, in fact,
What he was born with-meaning pure Imperial tact!
A CORRESPONDENT, signing himself “An Ecclesiastical and
Parliamentary Student," inquires—“What were the Apostolic
Constitutions?' Had they all of them exceptionally fine
constitutions, and, in a general way, at that period was a
Hebrew or Greek or Roman constitution superior to the
British constitution of to-day?" Of course we should be de-
lighted to solve his difficulties; but as, in the first place, they
are purely ecclesiastical, we beg to refer him to those excel-
lent authorities on such matters The Guardian, The Pilot, The
Tablet, and other Church papers, to whose department the

SPEECH AND SONG.
At a meeting held at Swansea to con-
gratulate Sir G. NEWNES on his return for
the borough, it is reported that Sir GEORGE,
after making an allusion to his silver
wedding, burst into song, and favoured
the company with a verse of CHEVALIER'S
“ My Old Dutch” in :a pleasing tenor
voice. It is also believed, though not
expressly stated, that in answer to an
enthusiastic encore he brought down the
house with “A little (tit-)bit off the top."

perhaps, rulez as to order might bear

HINTS ON MAKING ONESELF
THOROUGHLY OBJECTIONABLE.
II.-IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE.
TAKE care to allow yourself plenty of
time before the train stops for your final
effort. This depends largely upon eat-
ables, and may be left to the student's
discretion. Crumbly sandwiches will, of
course, have a share in it. But fruit,
such as greengages or apples, is invalu-
able. The stones or cores, as the case
may be, should be hurled across the com-
partment at the opposite window. It is
improbable that more than one in every
half-dozen will go through, especially if
the window is only open a little at the
top. The rest will rebound, and more or
less come in contact with the other pas-
sengers.
This amusement can be continued until
the train begins to slacken speed, when

you will doubtless observe everybody else

time in moving into another compartment,
where, let us trust, your efforts will meet
with the success they deserve during the
remainder of the journey.

prominent methods to be employed.

For many weeks past he had buried
himself in his study for hours at a
time. When he emerged it was with
face blanched, with cheeks hollow, and
with weary, dark-rimmed eyes. His quick
yet furtive steps, his nervous horror when
someone came to the front door, bespoke
the attitude of a man haunted by some
dread secret. Sometimes he hurried along

from his little wifey,” she said, with a
touching simplicity of diction that cynics
would have termed imbecile. “Tush,

hair. “Let me bear it by myself. Why

O MARY, I remember yet
The blissful moment when we met,
Each trundled in a bassinette,
By nursemaids each attended ;
You came, you saw, you conquered. I
Your slave remained till, passing by,
The laughing MADGE I chanced to spy,
And then your reign was ended.
The laughing MADGE I did adore
For full six months, then fell before
The eyes of sad ANITA.
She was my senior by a score
Of maiden years, or haply more,
But what of that? So sweet a
Divinity ne'er blessed the ways
Of mortal men. I loved to gaze
Upon her eyes and sing her praise,
Until I chanced to meet a
Still fairer star,
More radiant far,

GUERITA.
The golden ringlets that she shook
Seemed meant for soft caresses :
I worshipped them, until I took
A turn for ebon tresses.
Then raven KATE was my delight,
Who walks in beauty like the night :
She ruled me till I caught a sight
Of auburn ANGELINA,
For whom my passion still increased-
I loved her for a month at least,
In short, until
I met with WIL-

A BOXING-NIGHT ROUNDEL.
HERE we are again, dear SUE,
With the children at “the Lane" ;
Old and young, a merry crew,
Here we are again.
Wicked fairies' wiles are vain,
Through the briars the Prince breaks

Frees his bride from slumber's chain.
All is old, and all is new;
One forgets how seasons wane,

Here, we are again.

BECAUSE carols are never entirely satis-

to a public-house.
Because a trombone, a bassoon, and a
concertina should be in time and tune
to give due effect to a midnight rendering
of the Mistletoe Bough.
Because “merry gentlemen " can never
“sit at home at ease" with howling on
the crescendo in the street outside.
Because an application for largesse at
1 a.m, is inappropriate and irritating.
Because the plea that “Christmas
comes but once a year" is absolutely
unnecessary.
Lastly, because Yuletide would be a

A DETERMINATION.
TIME was I basked in pleasure's sun
With none to copy fair my life
Before I met and loved and won
My wife.
I did exactly what I pleased,
Leaving undone what I disliked ;
Time by the forelock ne'er I seized
Nor biked.

O'er countless counters how one's head

IN RE HOLLY AND MISTLETOE.
(A Topical Interview.)
“WHY, Father, you don't look very
cheerful,” said a 10, Bouverie Street Man.
“No, Sir, I don't. And, what is more,
Sir, when I am at home and off duty, I
don't intend to look cheerful.”
“Keep your hair-I beg pardon-your
holly and mistletoe on."
“There, again, Sir, you are in the
wrong. J don't appear in holly and mistle-
toe in the house. I keep my official
costume for the posters of goose clubs and
the outside of boxes of cosaques."
“ You need not be so snappish,” re-
monstrated the 10, Bouverie Street Man.
“ After all, you come but once a year.”
"And sufficiently often," acquiesced
the Father, and he continued in querulous
tone, “Yes, Sir, sufficiently often. Times
are not what they were. Why! in the day
of DICKENS I was welcomed with effusion.
Lord! how they gushed about me!"
“ You refer to the Christmas Carol.”
“ Yes; that was an enormous success.
But now it's out of date–except as a
reading."
“But surely you are still popular,"
“Not I. Everyone couples me with
unpaid bills and vacant chairs. Instead
of romping in with boars' heads and
minstrels and the rest of them, I am
scarcely recognised. There's a spectacle
atı Drury Lane, and some of the provincial
theatres give me a pantomime."
“But don't you do a little in your
character of Santa Claus ?".
“Not much. The rising generation
don't believe in me. The girl and boy
must be very young to look forward to my
conventional stocking. Besides, the
grocers sell my cadeaux of gifts weeks
and weeks before the date fixed for my
appearance."
“But don't you still do a fair trade in
cards for Yuletide and the New Year?
They are a help to the G. P. O."
“Sad falling off. I was talking it over
the other day with St. Valentine, and he
said he was not surprised. I cut him out,
and now I am cut out myself.”
“By whom?"

A PLEA FOR A PLURAL.
You, who in sultry weather
To Scotland take your way,
To roam the purple heather
And bring the grouse to bay,
Oh, sportsman intramooral,
Declare, I beg, to me,
If grouse possessed a plural,
What would that plural be?
What fairness is there in it
If other, meaner birds,
Lark, sparrow, swallow, linnet,
Have, all, their plural words?
One grouse we know and cherish ;
li shows but little vous,
When ten or twenty perish,
To group them all as grouse.
No matter what intention
Inspires them, I accuse
Of poorness of invention
These paltry single views.
If men may dwell in houses,
Why deem it a disgrace
To speak of grouse as “grouses "
Whenever there's a brace?
This word I note with pain, Sir,
Is hardly to your mind;
You bid me try again, Sir,
Some better term to find.

assertion that the world knows nothing
of its greatest men.
The crowd gathering closer round the
cab awaited with breathless interest the
issue of the unequal contest.
"Wot's this?" insisted cabby, holding
out the coin, which looked uncommonly
like a shilling.
The noble viscount, adjusting his spec-
tacles and jerking his head on one side
with gesture familiar in the high court of
Parliament, sternly regarded his inter-
locutor.
“My good man," he said, " are you not
aware that the oath of a Privy Councillor
imposes upon him conditions of the
strictest secrecy? I am not able to convey
to you information on any question, how-
soever immaterial it may appear to the
casual observer."
The Lord Privy Seal quickly stepped
within the portals of No. 10 Downing
Street. The cabman, after gazing reflec-
tively at the coin, put it in his pocket and
drove off. His remarks were unfortunately
not suitable for promiscuous circulation.
