RUDENT, wise, and happy men who have selected their libraries
as a squirrel lays by his winter hoard—without one decayed or
hollow nut in the lot—have, of course, on their shelves the
ELEven Volumes of Punch. There they stand—(hear you
not HANDEL's organ 2)—
“In burning row!”
On the shelves of Windsor Castle Library, Punch has eleven
magnificent coats of gorgeous crimson, “smeared with gold.”
For, representing English Letters and English Art, Punch is
the pet of the Palace, and is cherished by his Queen and his
Prince with a condescending tenderness unknown even to
royal pups and royal parrots. How often has a Cabinet Council
broken up, leaving some state riddle still unsolved, when, not
to mention names, the Highest Lady in the Land has consulted
the crimson-coated Punch, and straightway the enigma has
been clear as sunbeam
Amid the shades of venerable Lambeth, clothed in morocco
of episcopal purple, and shouldered on either side by tall saints
and corpulent fathers, stands Punch—the delight and monitor
of Archbishops; Bishops; Deans; Prebends; and Church
Pluralists—(holy men, with twenty hands, and a loaf or a fish
in either of them)—in particular !
In the Court of Chancery, bound—(the word has a terrible
significance)—in law-calf, Punch, dilated into Eleven Volumes,
gives a fragrance to mustiness, and casts a rosy colour upon parchment, that then does not appear the dead, discoloured skin of
flayed Justice.



## p. (#8) ##################################################

iy PREFACE.
From Palace Library to swing-shelf or cupboard of Two-pair back, does Punch, in his Eleven Volumes—coated, now in
Imperial velvet, now in decent cloth—stand as the Guide, Philosopher, and Friend of rejoicing thousands. His Volumes are now
the Press Lares, the Household Gods (with an additional two every twelvemonth) of English homes.
Well, Punch blandly requests any one or all of his million readers to refer to his First Volume. Punch came upon the
political stage with the present moribund Parliament. Punch felt that he had fulfilled his mission in the streets and highways of
life, and resolved to take higher ground. In his First Wolume he published his Address; a meek, modest, little manifesto, whose
chariness of profession is most delightfully, most tremendously, contrasted by universality of deed. Punch hates a cock-a-doodle
crow of triumph, as he hates the undertaker note of the raven; nevertheless, Punch will do a violence to his besetting modesty, by
asking of every member of the House of Commons—who began his functions about the very time that Punch first made his bow on
paper—if he can think of his promises to his constituency with that pleasant dilatation of the heart affecting Punch when
contemplating the modest proposals in his first number, with the enlarging achievements, the growing triumphs of the past six
years Talk of the doings of St. STEPHENs Pooh 1–ponder on the conquests of Saint Punch :
Why doth Punch refer to these his early days 2 Why doth he ask the reader—(i.e. all the A. B. C. world)—to cast an eye
upon that modest paragraph that, nearly six years since, like a small phylactery, was worn about the brow of infant Punch—sweet,
foolscap baby, fed on printer's ink?—For this one reason: to measure, if the reader's imagination will do it, the future doings of
Punch by the past.
The SUN, that lights the world, makes no professions of splendour—neither does Punch. He shines, and never talks about
it. The SUN does not say—“Ladies and Gentlemen below, I will get up to-morrow.” Certainly not ; but he does it. Neither
will Punch say what he will do in the course of the next Parliament; but he will do it.
And is Punch surprised at what the last six years have made him : Certainly not: he expected it, intended it.
Once upon a time, the wind shook an acorn to the ground. The swine were munching their meal; thousands of acorns
were swallowed. But this one acorn fell into a nice soft piece of earth; and the dews fell upon it, and in a brief time it seemed to
open its mouth, and then it said—“I am now but an acorn; but I will grow into a huge oak ; and I will become part of a ship that
shall sail to all corners of the world, bearing about all sorts of good things in my hold; and carrying the white flag of peace at my
mast-head to all nations.” Now this acorn was Punch.
At this election time, when so many men may ask how often they have turned themselves inside out by their votes, and may
therefore doubt another appeal to “an enlightened constituency”—Punch, certain of his re-election, says nothing, but points to his
now completed Twelve Volumes |
And the nation uplifts its millions of hands, and—with a laugh and a shout—exclaims—“WE Vote for PUNCH !”

Reception of Pictures at the Royal Academy-Arrival of the “Portrait of a Gentleman.”
ARTISTICAL INFORMATION.
Now is the time for the Exhibition of the Royal Academy, when the portraits
give the whole affair avery sad complexion. They goto watch the prºcess of the
carrying of the portraits into the Exhibition-room--a process very like entering
an appearance, though some who have been foolish engugh to have their por-
their own effigies begin to wonder how they could have
portraits to a public exhibition.

Now is the period for holding the annual Waterloo Banquet. The hero
Gomensal takes the chair on one side of the water, while the hero F. M. the
Duke of Wºllington presides on the other. The Astleian celebrities com-
prehend many illustrious names that are not admissible to the Apsleian enter-

trusses of straw, at the moment that six cuirassiers were carrying everything
before them, will, of course, not be excluded from the other side of the Water-

Now is the proper period for cultivating the winter crop of cigars, and
educating the cabbage for the elevated position it is destined to occupy on the
shelves of the tobacconist. “Sweets to the sweet" is a long-accepted maxim,
and “Greens to the green” is not less true or forcible. This is the age for
encouraging home-grown commodities; and what is more harmless, more
worthy of encouragement, than the harmless vegetable which will never make
a man ill, like a Manilla? (Oh!)

know that the presence of one is frequently accompanied by the absence of
the other. But if you wish to get rid of one nuisance, don't send for
another. Some seek a ventilator, who cures your chimney, but leaves the doc-

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL TOM THUMB.
AFTER A PARENTHESIS, THE GENERAL DISCOURSES
UPON CHRISTMAS IN ENGLAND.
EFORE I go on with this little account of the Britishers,
I may jist sot down two or three lines in answer to a cloud
of letters that has come upon me from citizens of America,
located in this country. Many on 'em—and MR. BANCROFT
in special, our ambassador—fault me for what they call
the imperfect use of my mother tongue. Well, I can't say:
praps they're right, and praps they're wrong. But the truth
is, they do speak the wust English in London—and in
special about the squares—that any critter ever heerd on
this airth. And when it's remembered, as it ought to be,
how much I have mixed in high life—that is, how many
tables of the aristocracy I've danced my hornpipe at evenin
parties upon—some allowance, I think, might be made
for any error or so of a mistake in, what BARNUM has told
me to call, “the hurry of composition.” Howsumever, when
I'm once clear of these British critters, and am agin
under the wings of the Columbian eagle, my English–
BARNUM is ready to wager it—will come agin purer than
ever. Shouldn't wonder.
As I do not belittle meself to write to the English, but
to the citizens of inlightened America, I shall break off
for a leetle bit from my 'count of my first appearance at
the 'Gyptian Hall, to talk about the way in which the
Britishers pass their Christmas ; a day which has jist
turned round the corner.
In the first place, long afore Christmas, every family
begins to fatten its own bullock—its own sheep—and its
own pig. They don't feed the critters upon corn and
peeches, as in the model republic, but cram’em with almond
cakes, and pine-apples, which, thanks to the West Indies—
that will be soon annexed to America, being, in fact, only
bits broken off her by an airthquake or somethin o' the
sort, and therefore our rightful property,+which pine-
apples, I was about to say, are as plenty as periwinkles, and plentier. Well, all the beasts are druw near to Portman-Square ; where
PRINCE ALBERT, as a patron of the fine arts, and the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE, as the friend and adviser of all the cooks in London, and therefore
a mighty stout judge of what jintes of all sorts are—come with a band of music belongin to the Horse Guards—(and you should see how
their silver kittle-drums sparkle !)—and give away silver meddles for first prize beef, and bunches of horse-radish for the second.
And after the prizes are given out, all the masters of the workhouses—they are called Unions out of joke, acause they break the
weddin-ring in 'em, and part man and wife—all of 'em buy the cattle, and puttin green boughs about their horns, and collars and bows of
ribbons round about and all over 'em, drive 'em to the workhouse; and for the pigs and sheep as can't walk, they hire cabs and hackney-
coaches. This very Christmas as is gone, the fattest ox was druv to the Union of St. Pancras ; but I don't know what for—and when I
axed BARNUM he wouldn't tell me—the St. Pancras ox was dressed in black ribbons ; and so was an ox that was druv to St. Marrowbone.
There will, next Christmas, I have heerd, be a sort of poultry show—kinder fancy fair like—for ladies; so that the lords of the
airth, as the men critters call themselves, mayn't have the fat all their own way at the Portman. The ladies and young gals will show
their turkies, and their ducks, and their geese, and roosters and hens, and be prized accordin. Only right and proper this. Why should
great, big, hulkin men carry away all the meddles for fat beef-(and after all, when they think they're growin meat, they're only makin
tarnation dear candles)—and the dear little pussey critters not have so much as a silver thimble for a plump rooster ? "Taint the straight
line by no means ; when the airth was made, woman was to have half of it ; but the truth must be said ; we have wronged the pretty
critter precious. And how kind she always was and is to us ! Never keepin nothin wholly to herself; for as I said to BARNUM the other day,
who only larfed and couldn't say nothin in answer—when, poor soul, she hadn't no more than one apple, didn't she give ADAM half of it 2
And so the ladies' poultry show—as LADY DoRoAs said to me yesterday—only proves a leetle more of the spirit of the times, and the
growin rights of women. (Dear critters 1 since I’ve been kissed as I have been, you can't think how I take 'em all to heart.) LADY
DoRCAs tells me that she's goin to fatten ring-doves upon peppermint-drops; whilst a great agricultural Duchess as she knows, has already got

a pen of turkies crammin on custards, tipsy-cake, and blank-mange.
I'll wager one of my dimond studs, that Royal Highness giv me, that
the women's poultry, with fair play to back 'em, will beat the cattle.
“Tipsy-cake aginst ile-cake,” ses I, and not a doubt on the matter.
However, as I'm upon Christmas, I'll tell you all about it—I'll shake
you all the flour out of the bag, and more than's in it, as the miller said
down east, to CoB, the miser, who was buried in a flint-skin waistcoat.
Their beef-'xceptin always the prize, which does railly make one
think of a candle-stick—is first chop ; and their plum-puddin is some-
how gathered from all the best eends of the varsal airth. But they
have a custom which is terrible to think on, 'specially for young single
fellars like me with their hearts to let, and so many pretty critters
wantin to take the lodgins.
It is this.-The gals go out on the last moonlight nights afore Christ-
mas, and—now, I’ve had all this story from LADY DoRoAs, and, in
course, it's as true as a thunderbolt—and searchin up and down the
woods about Lunnun, Highgate, and Hornsey, and Saint John's Wood
in particular—they climb up the oak and apple-trees, and cut off
branches of mistletoe ; a thing that, as a free Republican, I am proud
to say does not grow in smart America. Well, they bring home the
mistletoe and hang it up wherever it will hang in their houses ; and
there—as LADY DoRoAs ses to me—it is no sooner hung, than one
Cupid at least goes and perches in it, like a sparrow in a bird's-eye
maple ; and there he sits, a fingerin his bow and his arrow, awaitin
for his prey, like a hunter of old Kentuck for a 'possum.
Well ; when a young fellar enters the house, one of the gals lookin
as if she wouldn't drink dove's milk, she is so innocent—sidles and
sidles right under the mistletoe, and a half-larfin, and a half-poutin,
without sayin a word axes the young fellar to come under the 'den-
tical branch also ; and when there—he can't help it; twenty thousand
giants couldn't hold him from doin it—he kisses the gal smack; and
at the very moment twang goes the bow-string in the mistletoe, like
the fiddle-string of OLE BULL–and the young fellar is hit right through
hit waistcoat, without a drop of blood a showin the wound. Well, now
you may larf at me or not, as you like ; but in six months that young
fellar's that gal's husband. It was never known to fail. With mistletoe-
berries, they make bird-lime—ses LADY DoRoAs to me—and with
mistletoe they make bride-lime too.
One thing, however, is special good in English Christmas ; and it
has been specially attended to this Christmas as is jist over. It is
this. All the money that was won at cards—from pounds to half-
pence—was the very next mornin sent to buy small comforts for the
poor of the parish. “BARNUM,” ses I, for I'd been very lucky,
“BARNUM, take this leetle fifty.”

COURT.
EVERY one knows—or if, perchance,
He knows it not, it matters nought—
If along Fleet Street you advance,
On the left hand is Poppins' Court.
Who Poppins was, or whence he came,
Authority runs very short
Of telling us, or why the name
Of Poppins decks that humble court.
But it exists, and has its rights,
And its oppressors must be taught,
at each one who for Freedom fights
Will also fight for Poppins' Court.
“But,” the impatient reader cries,
“Cut sentiment and pathos short;
Tell us—Why should the nation rise,
Bent on avenging Poppins' Court f"
Well then, the poet shall be brief;
And, though with passion he is fraught,
He'll coldly, calmly tell the grief,
The wrongs, the ills of Poppins' Court.
It seems, then, many months ago,
Workmen the little passage sought,
And wooden beams began to throw
From house to house in Poppins' Court.
The natives, of their air bereft,
Their light block'd out by what was brought,
Quickly demanded right and left,
“What would ye do with Poppins' Court?”
A surly answer from a man
At length the natives did extort,
“Those beams across the street we ran
To make a sewer for Poppins' Court.”
* - * * * º
Long days, weeks, months, have passed away
Since those huge timbers first were brought,
And nothing has been done, they say,
Towards the new sewer in Poppins' Court.
The beams, which run across the street,
Make lodgers say, “This vast support
Shows we're not safe, let's beat retreat,”
And off they go from Poppins' Court.
Nor will new lodgers take the rooms ;
Those rafters danger do import ;
They cry—“Who'd come to live in tombs,
Boxed up with wood in Poppins' Court 2"
GUN-COTTON VERSUS GUNPOWDER.
It is said that the manager of some Continental theatre has adopted
the use of gun-cotton instead of gunpowder for all dramatic purposes.
We confess we do not see the advantage of the change, for the gun-
cotton makes very little noise or smoke, which are always most impor-
tant parts of any grand military spectacle. The only thing gained by
the gun-cotton is power ; and unless it is intended to add to the vrai-
semblance of a piece by killing the performers in earnest, we think the
increased force obtained by the new invention would be rather an
objection to its application to theatrical purposes. If mere noiseless-
ness is the object, it may be easily achieved by using toy-guns instead
of real fire-arms. It is only the noise that causes the illusion on the
stage, and a military tableau would be nothing without the smoke,
which, gradually clearing off, discloses a brilliant arrangement of vic-
torious troops, lighted up with a blaze of red fire from above, while the
vanquished soldiery at their feet are illumined by a quantity of blue,
which gives a death-like aspect to their ghastly features.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
M U S I C A L MOVE M E N T S.
THE Monster Drum has left town with Monsieur Julliex, to make
a promenade tour through the provinces. It is travelling with two
horses, which the talented maestro conducts with his usual skill. It
forms a very convenient diligence to Monsieur JULLIEN and his band,
the interior being fitted up as a rotonde, which will contain twice as
many persons as a metropolitan omnibus—that is to say, any indefinite
number—and seats being fixed outside to represent a banquette. This
is occupied, in addition to Mossieur JULLIEN, by the cornet-à-piston,
who plays at intervals the Post-horn Galop and the Postilion Quadrilles.
The ophicleide is only called upon to mimic the “wintry blast" when-
ever a gate is closed at night, and it is requisite to wake up the sleepy
pikeman ; which has given Jullien a notion for a new overture in five
bars. This Monster Drum is making a great noise wherever it goes.
It silences all opposition, and Monsieur JULLIEN has strong hopes that,
after a little bracing exercise, it will fill the whole world with the
echoes of its fame. As sound travels quicker in cold weather, it is
preceded everywhere by the loudest reports. It was heard of last
week in Manchester, though it had only just left London.
PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
obiLITY. From the Latin mobilitas, the
class of Nobles. The word nobiles, or, as
somecall it, nobs, simply signifies notables,
which leads to the inference that nobility
is not-ability. According to an old Latin
proverb, Virtus est sola nobilitas, Virtue is
the only nobility ; but if this" maxim
were enforced, there might be some
changes in the House of Peers, which
would greatly disturb the present arrange-
ments. A peerage of all the virtues is,
after all, rather impracticable ; for we
cannot fancy the Marquis of Morality,
– Viscount Veracity, or the Baron of
Benevolence. The only Virtue to whom wealth is generally attri-
buted, is Wisdom, who is said to possess a plentiful stock of pearls,
but these pearls are not of the kind usually found in coronets. The
only way in which Virtue is connected er ºfficio with the peerage, is by
the fact of the members sitting in the House of Lords by virtue of
their offices. We have heard of an old quotation to the effect of some-
body having made all his nobles “into ninepins.” A sad illustration of
this occurred in France during the revolution, when all the nobles
were treated as ninepins, by being knocked unscrupulously over.
NotARY. From notarius, a person so called from his habit of taking
down the words of a speaker. The modern notary not only takes
notes, but brings bills for payment, and takes down the words “No
effects,” “Not at home,” “No orders,” or other pithy sentences that
are often the only answer to his application. Their chief business,
now, is in attesting deeds ; but the deeds they in these days most
frequently attest is the refusal to honour a bill, which is not so much
a deed or thing done, as a person done by the acceptor of the document.
Notes of HAND. A stop-gap to the importunity of creditors.
NoTE, BANK of ENGLAND. Pieces of silver paper that may be
turned into gold.
NUIs ANCE. From nocere, to hurt. Anything which occasions annoy-
ance, damage, or inconvenience. Nuisances are either public or
private, and as a specimen of the former, we may point to the fountains
in Trafalgar Square, the Wellington Statue, and other works of art in
the metropolis. Private nuisances are such as annoy individuals only ;
as if a man obstructs my ancient lights, either by blocking up my
windows, or injuring my eyes by placing his fist in unpleasant
propinquity. The remedy for a private nuisance is an action on the
case, which I may certainly have if the nuisances, in interfering with
my personal views, should have also smashed my spectacles. The
abatement of a nuisance is literally beating it down, as was lately done
by a baton in the celebrated case of “Punch versus the Statue of the
DURE OF WELLINGTON.”
NUN. A mystery to us, from which we beg leave to decline the
trouble of attempting to remove the veil.
ARTISTIC POWER.
A PRovincIAL critic, speaking of a popular actress, says that “when
she ran out to meet her lover she carried the whole of the audience with
her.” We have heard of pieces “embracing the entire company,” but
the idea of an actress running off the stage and carrying with her an
entire audience, gives us the image of a lady with such a pair of arms-
full as it is really painful to contemplate. We make a good deal of
allowance for the power of genius, but its strength does not usually
consist in such tours de force as that which is described by our provin-
cial critic. This beats the ordinary theatrical feat of “bringing the
house down,” or “eliciting thunders” by electrifying the whole audience.
We have seen occasionally such a “beggarly account of empty boxes”
that the most fragile female performer might have “carried the entire
audience with her,” for it has consisted of a boy and a baby; but we
cannot believe a lady, so attractive as our provincial critic's description
indicates, could possibly have been in such a desolate position.
BOXING DAY.
MR John BULL called upon SIR Robert PEEL to ask him “to
remember that little matter he had promised him four years ago. He
meant the Repeal of the Income-Tax. The smallest trifle would do.”
The answer brought to MR. BULL was, that SIR Robert “had nothing
for him, and to go about his business.”
Several authors called at the British Museum, and hoped the Trustees
“would not forget them this year, but let them have something upon
the Catalogue, anything would be acceptable.” They were directed to
call again in 1856.
an Old Ancestral Shade.
THE Trinidad Spectator, in speaking of the Governor of the Island,
calls him Lord HARRIs. We do not believe in the existence of such an
individual. We are sure our Trinidadian contemporary is either hoaxed
or hoaxing. We hereby give him “notice to produce” the HARRIs of
the nobility. We address to the imaginary Lord the celebrated invo-
cation of Caspar to Zamiel, “Appear, a Peer 1" Whatever faith we
may put in the aristocracy, we must say that in the Harristocracy we
have none at all.

It appears that the expensive interference caused by the new Build-

the houses constructed in conformity with its provisions. When no
District Surveyors, Official Referees, and others, were allowed to have
a voice in the matter—a voice, by the bye, which is accompanied by
charges to a pretty tune—people built their premises substantially
enough for their own security. Tow that the new Act brings District

Metropolitan Buildings Act having been strictly attended to. Though
you must not touch a brick or interfere with a chimney unless the
officials get their fees, you get from them no advantage in the way of
safety or solidity. Everything is required to be so substantial, that the
foundations cannot bear the weight of the superstructure. It may be
said of the new Act, that it—

THE IRISH JOSEPH ADY.
N Monday last an old man, named DANIEL
O'Connell, was brought up on the charge of
having practised a trick very similar to that of
the celebrated Joseph Ady, of “something to
your advantage” motoriety. It appeared from
the evidence that the prisoner had been in the
habit of sending round for some years and soli-
citing subscriptions on the promise of being able
to, put the subscribers in the way of obtaining
something for their advantage. By this delusive
proceeding he had contrived to practise on the
credulity of persons of all classes, and it was
shown that he must have received, from first to last, an amount of
money that we do not name, lest it should seem incredible. On being
asked what he had to say in his defence, he replied, that what he
promised was really likely to prove advantageous to the persons who
subscribed their money.
The magistrate said, that even if it were, which he very much
doubted, there was no proof that the prisoner had any power to give
what he undertook to give, for though he had been taking money for
doing so during a number of years, he was not now in the slightest
degree nearer than he was at first to the fulfilment of his promise.
The defendant declared he was, but a person, named SMITH O'BRIEN,
who professed that he had been one of the Irish ADY's dupes, came
forward to contradict him with much earnestness.
It seemed on further investigation that the defendant had been in-
strumental in proving the right of a large number of persons to Catholic
emancipation, and on the strength of his reputation for having done
this, he had been ever since coming forward continually with “some-
thing to the advantage” of those who were willing to pay him.
The Magistrate said it was a very bad case, and indeed it was
melancholy to see a man, who might have become a most useful
member of society, reduced to his present degraded condition. It
appeared that no sum was too small, no pocket too scantily supplied
for him—the prisoner—to dip into. On looking into the nature of the
promised advantage, it was found to consist of Repeal, to which, in the
first place, the right of O'Connell's victims was very questionable ; in
the next place the good it might do them was more doubtful still ; and
in the last place, there was no doubt that O'Connell had neither the
intention, nor the power to give it them.
The prisoner said he was an old man, and must do something for
a livelihood. He had left a profitable business because he thought he
could let the Irish people hear of something to their advantage; and
it was very hard, after the trouble he had taken, to have his right to

The magistrate said that whatever trouble might be taken, no man
had a right to be paid for merely promising what he could not accom-
the lowest labourer, but the fraud and misrepresentation deprive him
of all claim for removal or sympathy. He was afraid the case now
before him was not unlike the one he had alluded to. The prisoner,
O'Connell, no doubt, found it troublesome enough to continue his de-
lusions, but this was the natural consequence of having neglected a
career of honest industry. In consideration, however, of his age, and
some former good conduct, the prisoner might be discharged with a
caution.
The Irish ADY immediately retired from the dock, exclaiming,
“Hereditary bondsmen, know ye not,” &c., &c., and had scarcely got
outside the door of the Court before he was at his old tricks, promising
every Irishman he met “something to his advantage.”

The Best Destination for the Statue.
As there seems to be a variety of opinions as to the material of which
the rewards for the Peninsular veterans should be made, the best way
to end the dispute will be to break up the monster statue at Hyde
Park Corner, and have him melted down into medals. There is plenty
of metal in the charger for this purpose, and the long-agitated question
about the real breed of the horse would be settled at last by his turning
out to be a cross. SIR FREDERICK TRENCH should have the superin-
tendence of this job, as he can point to his numberous reverses in
matters of Art as having stamped himself the most finished meddler.
NEVER SAY DIE.
Such appears to be the motto of the old bridge of Westminster.
Though his existence has been marked by various closings, we find him
plish, nor indeed for any misrepresentation of any kind. Doubtless, the
begging impostor, who stands shivering in the streets on a frosty day,
and bares his limbs to excite sympathy, has a harder task than even
once more giving symptoms of vitality. He began receiving company
last week, and though he seemed to be a good deal shaken, he exhibited
on the whole far more firmness than might have been expected.

fit to make home pleasant to him who has been absent all day.
Such men surely ought to have their Clubs, and we will not class
them among Club Snobs therefore:—on whom let us reserve our attack
for next week.
- VOYAGE ACROSS THE STRAND.
FROM the difficulty experienced by passengers crossing the streets in
the crowded thoroughfares, it may be interesting to hear the following
particulars from the narrative of “A Voyage from the Thirty-fifth
lamp-post in the Strand to the Shop directly opposite.” Extract from
log —“Three o'clock P.M. Cleared from the curb-stone, with fair
weather, hoping to reach the opposite side of the street before dusk;
carrying main-top-coat and reefed umbrella.
“3 h. 2 min. Tacked to post to avoid an omnibus ; shipped a mud,
which damaged the patent boots.
“3 h. 4 min. Stood to the south, coasting along a reef of cabs; nearly
run down by a butcher's cart; passed a milliner girl in distress, who
had missed stays.
“3 h. 7 min. Saw an apothecary’s light; tried to take an observation,
but the light was lost in a fog of cabriolets.
“3 h. 10 min. Ran into by a coal cart; carried away larboard coat-
skirt; stood off and on to wait for an opening in the cab-bergs.
“3 h. 15 min. Fetched the end of the coach-stand ; hailed a buss
under blue colours and easy sail, bound for the westward, making to-
wards Kensington ; hauled to the north-east, and steered with great
difficulty among floes of waggons.
“3 h. 20 min. Lighted a cigar, and put on all steam ; hoisted the
spencer.
3 h. 30 min. Came in sight of land, and two minutes afterwards an-
chored in the roads by a street-post.”
THE PUNCH ANECDOTES.
ELO QUENCE.
E think it was LoRD BRough AM, who, upon being
asked whether O'Connell, made much money by
his eloquence, said, “Why, sir, he coins money
—he makes bank-notes out of the very rags
of his countrymen.”
. DEMosthen Es (who was called by TULLY “the
First of orators and the Last of men”) had one
great weakness, he could not refuse a bribe.
When he did not want to plead, he would appear
in court with his face muffled up, and pretended
he had lost his voice. “The voice of DEMos-
THENES,” said one of his miserable clients, “is
very like himself; it is to run away at the begin-
ning of an action.”
He asked one day in court, when he was hold-
ing his handkerchief up to his mouth, and was
shamming to be in great pain, what was the best
cure for the toothache “Getting a client,”
answered Phocio N, “to stop it with gold.”
Joseph HUME was told that the toe of the
statue of St. Peter at Rome was nearly worn
away with kissing. “I’ll be bound it's all the women's doing,” exclaimed
the greatest orator of the day; “they're so fond of kissing, wherever
there's a bit of mizzletoe.”
GRAcchus always had a flute-player at his side whilst he was speak-
ing, in order to regulate the pitch of his voice. He was questioned
why he chose particularly a flute; “To mind my stops,” answered the
noble father of the GRACCHI.
It was a favourite saying of Porson's, that all Directors of Railways
and Insurance Companies must be very great dunces, for he never knew
one yet who could decline “bºnus.”
The laconic eloquence of the Spartans is very well known, but the
following illustration of it, we think, is new. A Persian general, called
EUDAMSAUNIAs, made sure of beating a Spartan commander, and sent a
herald to ask him what weapon he would prefer being thrashed with ?
“Axe,” indignantly replied the brave son of Sparta, and the effect of
that one word was such that not a soldier of EUDAMSAUNLAs' survived
that day.
“It's all nonsense,” exclaimed SHERIDAN ; “members may deliver
speeches, but it is the reporters who make them. I have often been
surprised, on waking up in the morning, to find myself a great orator.
Every reporter is an ORPHEUs, who, by playing the literary lyre, ex-
tracts music out of the veriest sticks and stones.”
The following anecdote is too well authenticated to be doubted :-
“Several huissiers were sent after ScARRoN to arrest him, but he sup-
plicated their mercy in such an eloquent manner, asking them repeat-
edly, “if they were men —and whether they had hearts º' that the
only man who had the cruelty to take him was a Gascon, who hap-
pened to be deaf.”
“Those who were fortunate enough to see, on June 19th, 1846, the
blush of SIR JAMEs GRAHAM, will agree with me,” says MR. THoMAs
DU.Ncombe, “that it is not necessary to speak in order to be eloquent.
The most thrilling speech could not have produced a more thrilling
sensation. The effect was such that the house adjourned shortly
afterwards. His oldest friends were surprised, and his enemies com-
pletely confounded, by this unparalleled display. I must do SIR JAMES
GRAHAM the justice to confess that I did not think it was in him.”
BonAvRNTURE, in his World of Words, says, “The reason there are so
very few female orators is because a woman, when once she begins to
talk, never knows when to leave off.”
It was mooted a twelvemonth back to have the new frescoes in the
House of Commons painted in wax. “You had better not,” said
SERJEANT MURPHY-" the Irish members, with their eloquence, will
melt them all.”
SHIEL learns everyone of his speeches by heart. He rehearses them
always at home to a collection of old parrots, whom he has taught to
say, “hear,” “order,” and to whistle, scream, crow, and make all sorts
of deafening noises. The interruptions he receives from them in the
course of his speech, as he gets energetic, give him confidence, he says,
for the House of Commons, as he imagines, when he addresses the
members, that he is only speaking to so many parrots. He has given each
of them a different name, but we will be generous, and not repeat one.
SPORT OF THE SEASON.
A variety of the game of Snapdragon is one of the favourite sports
and pastimes of the City of London. It is played by dabbling in the
Stocks and in Railway Shares ; but whilst a few, here and there, get
plums by this amusement, very many more burn their fingers.

GEOGRAPHY FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN.
UCH mighty changes are taking place daily
in the division of kingdoms, that we expect
by the time we are octogenarians, that
Europe will have quite a new face. She has
changed lately so many of her old features—
Poland on one side, and the Pyrenees on
another—that it will be impossible to recog-
nise her, in a short time, for the same Europe
that she was in the present century, before
she had turned forty. We are indebted to a
celebrated clairvoyant for the following in-
sight into the state of the world in, say,
1896, the period when Prussia will pro-
bably be receiving her long-promised consti-
tution.
Spain will be annexed to France, and
Portugal will, as a matter of course, go
will be attached to Algeria, which will be ruled by Bugeaud le II*
Autocrate de toutes les Afriques.
The Isle of Man will be under the sway of Joinville, who will like-
wise be the absolute monarch of all the Hebrides, with the right of
succession to Eel Pie Island and Waterloo Bridge.
Russia will be permanently enlarged, and will occasionally publish a
ºn. either in the shape of Egypt or the Caucasus, or a bit of
key.
Austria and Prussia will divide Germany, the students of which will
sing oftener than ever, “Was ist das Waterland?” and drink endless
chopines of beer, in the hopes of getting an answer.
Ireland will be recognised an independent state by all the powers of
Europe, which is strong presumptive evidence that it will be seized
upon by one of them the following year. The Blarney Stone will be
carried to Dublin, and SMITH OBRIEN will be crowned upon it
Dictator of Ireland. The fact of his dictatorship will be published in a
five-shilling advertisement in the Nation, and will be proved by his
dictating half-a-dozen letters a day.
Italy will be governed by Pope PUseyUs I.
|
Greece will be let on a repairing lease, to any king who likes to
become a tenant of it.
Belgium will be a vestibule to France, and Holland the landing-place
leading into it.
America will have annexed the Cannibal Islands, the Canadas, the
Atlantic Ocean, New South Wales, Alderney, and the North Pole,
besides an enormous National Debt, which it will repudiate at the
earliest opportunity. The throne will be filled, as a matter of course,
with a Coburg, which will still be maintained as a nursery for kings.
England will be—but at this interesting point a full stop was put to
the coma, under the influence of which our clairvoyant had been giving
us the above authentic revelations, by his suddenly jumping up when
the dinner-bell rang; and we are sorry we cannot say what England
will be in 1896. We might guess, but we are sure our readers can do
that just as well as ourselves. Clairvoyance is too sacred a subject to
be jested upon.
THE BEY OF TUNIS AND LOUIS-PHILIPPE.
THE Bey of Tunis has, it is said, been persuaded by Louis-PHILIPPE
to make him a present of CLEoPATRA's needle. The king of the
French has had an eye upon this needle for a long time, and has at
length made the Bey of Tunis believe that it will be the means of sewing
up any rent that may ever have existed in their relations, and indeed
repairing the most extensive breaches. The ceremony of removing
the needle from its present position is to be conducted in solemn
silence, so that it may hereafter be said, “At the fall of the needle you

he is engaged to make his next appearance. If this plan of firing a
horse should be adopted, it will be necessary to conduct the experiment
with gun-cotton, as gunpowder, it has been proved, is the last thing in
the world to make the Duke fly.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XLV.-CLUB SNOBS.
UCII a sensation has been
created in the Clubs by the
appearance of the last paper
on Club Snobs, as can't
but be complimentary to
me who am one of their
number.
I belong to nine clubs.
The Union Jack, the Sash
and Marlingspike — Mili-
tary Clubs. The True
Blue, the No Surrender,
the Blue and Buff, the Guy
Fawkes, and the Cato
Street—l’olitical Clubs.
The Brummell and the
Regent—Dandy Clubs. The
Acropolis, the Palladium,
the Areopagus, the Pnyx, the Pentelicus, the Ilyssus, and
the Poluphloisboio Thalasses—Literary Clubs. I never
could make out how the latter set of Clubs got their
names; I don't know Greek for one, and I wonder how
many other members of those Institutions do.
Ever since the Club Snobs have been announced, I
observe a sensation created on my entrance into any one
of these places. Members get up and hustle together ;
they nod, they scowl, as they glance towards the present
Snob. “Infernal impudent jackanapes | If he shows me
up,” says Colonel BLUDYER, “I’ll break every bone in
his skin.” “I told you what would come of admitting
literary men into the Club,” says RAN ville RANVILLE to
his colleague, Spoon Ey, of the Tape and Sealing-Wax
Office. “These people are very well in their proper places,
and, as a public man, I make a point of shaking hands
with them, and that sort of thing ; but to have one's
privacy obtruded upon by such people is really too much.
Come along, Spooney,” and the pair of prigs retire
superciliously.
As I came into the coffee-room at the No Surrender,
old JAwkINs was holding out to a knot of men, who were
yawning, as usual. There he stood, waving the Standard,
7ini,
and swaggering before the fire.

“What,” says he, “did I
If you touch the Corn Laws, you
touch the Sugar Question; if you touch the Sugar, you
touch the Tea. I am no monopolist. I am a liberal man, but I cannot forget that
I stand on the brink of a precipice; and if we are to have Free Trade, give me
reciprocity. And what was SIR Robert PEEL's answer to me? MR. JAwRINs,
he said "–
Here JAwkins's eye suddenly turning on your humble servant, he stopped his
sentence, with a guilty look—his stale, old, stupid sentence, which every one of us
at the Club have heard over and over again.
JAwkins is a most pertinacious Club Snob. Every day he is at that fire-place,
holding that Standard, of which he reads up the leading article, and pours it out, ore
rotundo, with the most astonishing composure, into the face of his neighbour, who has
just read every word of it in the paper. JAwRINs has money, as you may see by
the tie of his neckcloth. He passes the morning swaggering about the City, in
bankers' and brokers' parlours, and says:—“I spoke with PEEL yesterday, and
his intentions are so and so. GRAHAM and I were talking over the matter, and I
pledge you my word of honour, his opinion coincides with mine ; and that
Whatdyecallum is the only measure Government will venture on trying.” By
evening-paper time he is at the Club : “I can tell you the opinion of the City,
my lord,” says he, “and the way in which Jones Loyo looks at it is briefly this ;
Rothschilds told me so themselves. In Mark Lane, peºple's minds are quite made
up.” He is considered rather a well-informed man.
He lives in Belgravia, of course; in a drab-coloured genteel house, and has
everything about him that is properly grave, dismal, and comfortable. His dinners
are in the Morning Herald, among the parties for the week; and his wife and
daughters make a very handsome appearance at the Drawing-Room, once a-year,
when he comes down to the Club in his Deputy-Lieutenant's uniform.
He is fond of beginning a speech to you by saying “When I was in the House,
I, &c.”—in fact he sat for Skittlebury for three weeks in the first reformed Par-
liament, and was unseated for bribery ; since which he has three times unsuccess-
fully contested that honourable borough.
Another sort of political Snob I have seen at most Clubs, and that is the man
who does not care so much for home politics, but is great upon foreign affairs. I
think this sort of man is scarcely found anywhere but in Clubs. It is for him the
papers provide their foreign articles, at an expense of some ten thousand a year
each. He is the man who is really seriously uncomfortable about the designs of
Russia, and the atrocious treachery of Louis-PhILIPPE. He it is who expects a
French fleet in the Thames, and has a constant eye upon the American President,
every word of whose speech (goodness help him l) he reads. He knows the names
of the contending leaders in Portugal, and what they are fighting about ; and who
it is says that LoRD ABERDEEN ought to be impeached, and LoRD PALMERston
hanged, or rice rersá.
Lord PALMERston's being sold to Russia, the exact number of roubles paid, by
what house in the city, is a favourite theme with this kind of Snob. I once over-
heard him—it was CAPTAIN SPITFIRE, R.N., (who had been refused a ship by the
Whigs, by the way)—indulging in the following conversation with Mr. MINNs

The interest taken in this feeble old structure, renders it necessary
that we should publish occasional bulletins for the information of the
public. We have appointed a sort of medical attendant, or rather a
standing counsel, to whom we have given what may be called a watch-
ing brief, with instructions to watch every turn in the case of this
venerable piece of masonry. The following are extracts from the note-
book of our learned friend, who has been specially retained to observe
the changes in the aspect of the structure:-
“6 o'clock A.M. The Bridge has passed a tolerably quiet night, and
seems to exhibit more than its ordinary firmness. Once or twice
during the night it was much agitated by the heavy night-mares pass-
ing over it.
“8 o'clock A.M. The bridge has received a few visitors, but did not
seem to be very greatly affected. It shed one big drop from the centre
of its arched brow at the approach of an old familiar omnibus. The
bridge soon resumed its firmness, but it was natural that it should be
somewhat moved on the first occasion of a visit from an old and early
companion, who had not seen the unhappy bridge since that day which
was generally believed to have been the closing one of its existence.
“12 o'clock at noon. The poor thing is in a violent state of delirium
tremens from the nervous excitement occasioned in consequence of the
influx of company. Fearing that my poor friend would give way
under it, and that the result might prove more than I could possibly
stand, I determined on retiring while yet unmoved, and I am therefore
unable to record anything further in my note-book.”
Our learned friend's weak and imbecile desertion of his post left us
in a most awkward position, for we were without any accounts of the
state of the Bridge during the afternoon, which may be called the daily
crisis of its miserable existence. If it gets through the period when
the traffic is at its height, a quiet night may generally be looked for;
but it is during the afternoon that its condition is most precarious, for
the feverish beating on the crown of the poor old thing continues
incessantly. We have, however, heard from a private source which
we—but no one else—are in the habit of relying on, that life-preservers
for man and beast are to be sold at the foot of the bridge on either side,
until further notice. The two engravings annexed will furnish a clue
to the manner in which this arrangement can be applied to the human
and equestrian passengers. We think, in fact, that while the Bridge
remains open, no horse weighing more than so many hundred weight,
and no gentleman exceeding so many pounds in weight, should be
allowed to peril his life upon the Bridge without one of the preservers.
Whether the arrangement should be at the expense of the public or of
the authorities who allow the dangerous pass to continue open, is a
question that may be hereafter considered,
THE OLD 'YEAR AND THE NEW.
1846 (speaks.)
I FAINT upon December's lap of snow,
I watch my lees of life drop one by one ;
Young forty-seven is on the watch below,
To fill my shoes, almost ere breath be gone.
But listen, greedy heir, tho' faint and old,
My heart is big with work, not worked in vain;
This hand, now palsied, forced Protection's hold
And loosed the giant Commerce from his chain.
And all this night, the last night of my life,
Ere I go hence to join the ghosts of Time,
I have had glorious visions.—War and Strife
Lay dead, and by them Hunger, Hate, and Crime.
And Peace and Plenty, Knowledge, Hope, and Love,
Shone round my bed like angels, and bowcd down
To my dim eyes ; and then there came a dove,
That placed on my frone hair an olive crown.
Who will crown thee, young upstart 2 What remains
Of glory such as mine beneath the stars 2
The year, that shook from industry her chains,
The year that spoke the doom of human wars 1
1847 (answers.)
Scowl not in death, old sire, nor think my hand
Would break one leaf from off thy crown :-In thce
I bow to a great year; but through the land
Achievement large enough is left for me.
Thy boon is incomplete; what thou hast given,
Material blessing to material man,—
Who waits what I must do, ere he have striven
Up to the compass of his human span.
Thou gavest wealth, I'll teach him how to use it;
Thou gavest peace,—its arts I must bestow ;
War, thanks to thee, is such, that they who choose it,
Choose isolation, beggary, and woe.
But Ignorance is left, and where that is,
Is war 'twixt light and darkness ; be it mine
To chase that darkness back to the abyss,
To lift that light, wide as age, sex, or clime.
What schools must I not build “What prisons purge 7
What self-contented foulness clear away ?—
Oh, there is work for me—and in my dirge
Deeds may be told, great as in thine, to-day !

THE MAHOGANY TREE,
Evenings we knew,
Happy as this;
Faces we miss,
Pleasant to see.
Kind hearts and true,
Gentle and just,
Peace to your dust 1
We sing round the tree.
CHRISTMAs is here ;
Winds whistle shrill,
Icy and chill:
Little care we.
Little we fear
Weather without,
Sheltered about
The Mahogany Tree.
Care, like a dun,
Lurks at the gate:
Let the dog wait ;
Happy we'll be 1
Drink every one ;
Pile up the coals,
Fill the red bowls,
Round the old tree l
Commoner greens,
Ivy and oaks,
Poets, in jokes,
Sing, do ye see :
Good fellows' shins
Here, boys, are found,
Twisting around
The Mahogany Tree.
Drain we the cup.–
Friend, art afraid 7
Spirits are laid
In the Red Sea.
Mantle it up ;
Empty it yet;
Once on the boughs,
Birds of rare plume
Sang, in its bloom ;
Night-birds are we :
Here we carouse,
Singing, like them,
WINDSOR FESTIVITIES.
It is with warm and unaffected satisfaction that we call
attention to a distribution of beef, bread, and pudding, to the
poor on New Year's Day, in the presence of HER MAJEsty at
Windsor. Nor were the interior linings of the needy the sole
objects of regard, for there were blankets, cloaks, rolls of
flannel, and other materials, intended to provide comfortable
external covering for the recipients of the royal bounty. A slice
of beef is well enough for the hour, but a good bit of flannel
will last the entire season. Pudding is delicious for the
day, but there is more permanent advantage in a petticoat.
Our good-natured old friend, the Duke of CAMBRIDGE, was
of course present at the scene, but the distribution of the beef
T seemed to have more charms for him than the giving out of
the clothing. When the smoking sirloins began to be served up, he could no longer
keep his distance in the balcony, but he came down and mingled with the crowd, to
whom he addressed a number of remarks on the beef, in the true spirit of a connoisseur
and a critic. He gave a synoptical glance at the early history of suet, in a few rapid
but recherché observations; and gave an illustration of “What to eat, drink, and
avoid,” for the benefit of the humble partakers of the Royal Charity. In two or three
instances he tasted the object of his eulogy, and in the spirit described by the poet, when
“Those who went to scoff remained to pray,”
the Duke of CAMBRIDGE placed himself immediately in such a position, with regard
to the beef, as to allow us to say of him that
“He who went to give remained to eat.”
* We beg to be understood most fully as having no objection to see IIis Royal
Highness condescending to “pick a bit” with the poor on such occasions. We had
rather he should sympathise with the guests at such a feast as that which the QUEEN
gave at Windsor than take the chair at the grandest banquet that ever graced the
Hall of the Freemasons.
FROM THE COURT CIRCULAR.—(owissions.)
The Court Circular one day last week, informed the public that PRINCE ALBERT
had, on the previous morning, amused himself at Frogmore by skating. It omitted,
however, to mention the following interesting circumstance —
“His Royal Highness, in compliment to his august consort, and to the great admiration of the lookers on,
cut out the letters W. R. on the ice.”
. Another omission was made by the Court circular—of course from motives of mean
jealousy :-
“His Royal Highness, amid cheers and laughter, endeavoured next to cut out the letters P. U. N. C. H.;
but the attempt was not quite successful.”
It was remarked, “that clever as his Royal Highness was, he was hardly able to
cut out Punch.”
Perched round the stem
Of the jolly old tree.
Let us forget,
Round the old tree.
Here let us sport,
Boys, as we sit ;
Laughter and wit
Flashing so free.
Life is but short—
When we are gone,
Let them sing on,
Round the old tree.
Sorrows, begone !
Life and its ills,
Duns and their bills,
Bid we to flee.
Come with the dawn,
Blue-devil sprite,
Leave us to night,
Round the old tree.
THE PECKHAM WOLF.
The papers have lately announced the alarming fact
that a wolf has been shot at Peckham. The incident
has given quite a romantic reputation to this under-
sized suburb, and Peckham is beginning to place
itself on a sort of par with the Pyrenees. Peckham,
infested with wolves, is really a grand idea. We shall
be hearing next of an avalanche falling from Snow
Hill, or a horde of brigands at Battersea.
We remember to have seen a hare-hunt in Pater-
noster Row ; and a wild-goose chase along the Strand
is a very common pastime; but a wolf at Peckham
is something as new and startling as a bison on
Battle Bridge, or a coatamundi prowling about the
Temple. We should scarcely be surprised to see a
tiger dart out from the jungle in Leicester Square ;
but we say again, we have no faith in the story of a
wolf at Peckham.
The Eteal and Ideal.
The Morning Post puts its readers on their guard
against the purchase of imitation brilliants, which
are said to be very ingenious and very plentiful. . It
is one of the peculiar advantages of Punch, that his
brilliants are so unquestionably of the first water as to
be wholly inimitable ; and though ingenuity has now
and then been displayed in trying to get up a counter-
|feit, the public has always, at once, detected the
| difference.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DIPLOMATIC BOUQUET.
ERTAINLY that great cook, SoYER –
the only true Minister of the Interior—
has resolved that France and England
shall not mutually retire into a state of
isolation. No ; SoYER would carry the
olive into the very bowels of France,
and bind the two countries together in
one Bouquet de Gibier; or what may be
freely translated, a nosegay of game. To
which end, he despatched from the Re-
form Club, on the 23rd ult, the aforesaid
nosegay to their Majesties of the French.
“The height of the bouquet,” says the
Times—
“Was about ten feet, and wide in proportion ;
the frame was richly covered with Christmas holly,
laurels, misletoe, and evergreen, with a great variety
of winter flowers. There were twenty-two head of game, consisting of larks, snipes,
woodcocks, teal, French and English !. grouse, widgeons, wild ducks,
blackcocks, pheasants, a leveret, a hare, and golden plovers. The interstices were lightly
filled with wheat and oats, the whole ornamented with tri-coloured ribbons.”
We see a profound political lesson in this bouquet. The oriental
mode of a declaration of love by means of flowers is well known ; and
SoYER, like a great genius, has elevated a comparative common-place
into the grand and instructive. LoRD PALMERston may write long
letters with the quill of the thunder-bearing eagle, and the MARQUIs of
NorMANBy, with face of diplomatic stone, may present them,--but
what is all this to the significance of SoYER's bouquet There is
matter in it for a whole winter night's contemplation, long as winter
nights are at this present writing. Let us first consider the frame.
The “holly” with its prickly spikes, hints of English swords and
bayonets, and, moreover, if Louis-PHILIPPE be a reader of SouthEY,
which no doubt he is, suggests to him, that
“All vain asperities he day by day
Should wear away,
*Till the smooth temper of his age should be
Like the high leaves upon the holly tree,”
The “laurel” is, as Ophelia would say, for memory of certain little
affairs in the last war with perfidious Albion ; whilst the “misletoe”
suggests—and we thank SoYER for the suggestion—the propriety of
a kiss of lasting peace between the two nations. The “larks” have a
playful allusion to the friskiness of Louis-PHILIPPE at Eu, when he
out-diplomatised (we choose to make a word now and then) our good,
unsuspecting little QUEEN. (Perhaps lapwings, that only pipe to
cheat, would have been a truer illustration ; but, possibly, a little too
strong.) The “woodcocks,” living only on suction, indicate the con-
dition of England depending upon the mere word of the King of the
French. The “wild-duck” gaily points to the sportive Duchess DE
MonTPENSIER, whilst the “leveret” means something about the Spa-
nish Crown, and its future heir. “Golden plovers” indicate the
money-power of England to carry on a war; whilst the “wheat and
oats” touchingly declare the right and duty of nations to bestow upon
one another their daily bread. We understand that Louis-PHILIPPE
was much affected on reading (more Turcorum) the bouquet, and as he
gave orders to his cook to have it served at table, there is no doubt
that his Majesty has ere this laid the contents nearer to his heart than
any missive ever yet written by ABERDEEN or PALMERSTON.
IMAGINARY (RAILWAY) CONVERSATIONS.
THE perusal of the Electric Telegraph, if we could trace in those
lines what they are talking about, would, we are sure, furnish a most
amusing volume of miscellanies. When we see the wire vibrate with
a thrilling motion, we can fancy that it bears some ecstatic message
from some ardent lover, and we see, in our imagination, the
“Soft intercourse from soul to soul, .
Wafted along from pole to pole,”
as it passes from one station to the other. Filled with these sentimental
reflections, we rushed into the telegraph-room at a London terminus,
and made it an earnest request that we should be admitted to the
confidence of that electric communicator, so refined and “air-drawn,”
like Macbeth's dagger. Our entreaty was answered with ready acqui-
escence, when to our utter horror the question asked, was, “How are
you off for coals f" and the answer returned, was “Pretty well, thank
you.”
THE VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES.
OH, why will man such danger run,
And madly brave the Fates,
To get some temporary fun
Upon a pair of skates ?
'Tis pleasant, on a winter's day,
Fleet o'er the ice to glide ;
But what is Life itself, I pray,
But one long winter slide 2
A rapid journey, where a stop
Is fatal to success ; -
Keep moving, or you’ll surely drop—
Such crowds behind you press.
Unless you onward boldly go,
Backsliders in your train
Will cause your sudden overthrow—
You'll ne'er get up again.
..Heed not, although you are not strong,
Pursue your even way;
Although you cannot get along,
Some friend behind you may.
Straightforward, if your action proves,
Ne'er from right line recoiling ;
By aid sometimes of friendly shoves,
You'll keep the pot a-boiling.
IBIow much for the Bonds of Union f
From a letter in the Times it appears that out of the twenty-seven
States which compose the Union, there are eight which have failed to
pay their debts. Pennsylvania is not included in that number, as she
has, singular to state, resumed payment since February, 1845. Eight
states out of twenty-seven, however, is not a bad beginning for a
juvenile country, which is scarcely yet out of its teens. We should
call them the most promising States in the world, considering their
creditors are never paid in anything but promises. Instead of dividing
the Union into North and South America, it would be better, we think,
to make a fresh division. Future geographers should make a separate
mention of those States which have paid their debts, and those which
have repudiated them. They might be distinguished as the Solvent
and Insolvent States of America.
THE PORTUGUESE Service.
THE two armies in Portugal seem, instead of rushing into each other's
arms, intent upon keeping up the distance there has lately been be:
tween them. The soldiers must have been told, before they entered
into service, “No followers allowed.”

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
ray GENERAL TOM THUMB.
THE GENERAL DISCOURSES ON ENGLISH CUSTOMS-NEW YEAR'S
DAY AND TWELFTH-CAKE ART. BARNUM DEFINES MODESTY.
N the last occasion I told you a leetle about the Bri-
tishers' Christmas, and might fill a letter-sheet with
the 'count of New Year's Day, and Twelfth-Cake
Day, and sich like; but tainte my notion. No ; I
shall at once go on with the greatest subject on airth
—meself. However, as I’m a writin at a charitable
time of the year, I don't mind settin down two or
three matters afore I begin with 'Gyptian Hall.
In the first place, for New Year's Day. The QUEEN
and the Prince are very charitable at the Castle.
- All the oldest and forlornest Members of Parliament
meet in the Quodrangle ; and then the LoRD CHANCELLOR and the
ARchbishop of CANTERBURY distribute, as the papers call it, Her
Majesty's bounty to the poor critters; consisting of law-books, writ
to the meanest understanding, and sermons, and tracts, and sich
like things, to teach 'em the strait line towards their deluded consti-
tuents when the House of Commons 'sembles. There is also another
very pretty custom—terrible affectin, I can tell you. It is this :-
There is three kings, they say, reigning at a place they call
Somerset House. Kings of the Poor. I’ve never seen their crowns
and robes, but, thinking of their subjects, suppose 'em to be crowned
with straw, and robed with tatters. Well, BARNUM tells me that these
kings—kinder like the Pope in Rome, BARNUM ses—go every New-
Year's Eve to some West-End workhouse—they went to St. James's
this year—and wash the feet and hands of all the poor with Windsor
soap, and dry 'em on damask towels. This is only to show what
the Kings of the Poor, in this country, think of the Poor. But they're
always doin somethin with 'em.
The Twelfth-cakes, at this season,. are monstrous beautiful. The
figures are mostly LoRD John Russell and the rest of the ministers
in the very best sugar ; that the children may fill their leetle bellies
with principles, BARNUM ses, without knowin it. The Britishers
have high notions of art for Twelfth-cakes ; but are easy pleased with
out o' door statues. Anything, they think, will do in bronze or stone,
but they are mighty particklar in art when it comes to sugar.
BARNUM ses they succeed better with Twelfth-cakes 'cause all the
confectioners set their faces against Royal 'Cademicians. I haven't
the smallest crumb of doubt upon it, that's it.
And now about 'Gyptian Hall. BARNUM had got it put about in
the papers, that Gracious Majesty had asked me to muffins; and, more-
over, had got some wood-cuts, I think he called 'em, in the Ulcerated
Neurs, and other pictur papers, showing how I didn't dance a quadrille
with Gracious Majesty, and how I did lick his Royal Highness at a game
of billiards, standinon the table and givin him five. And, moreover, there
were picturs of the dimond studs, and rings, and all the gifts, down to
the royal housemaid's thimble flung in at the carriage, at Buckinham
Palace. Well, as the Ulcerated Neurs goes into the busums of all
families, and there's nothin like picturs for teachin the true grit of
politics, all the world soon knowed about ToM THUMB ; and I'm a
sinner, if it didn't take a body of police, with Colonel RowAN sittin
in his saddle always at their head, to keep the Britishers clear of our
door, that was always obleeged to be opened with the chain up, in fear
they'd break in upon us. Once or twice BARNUM thought he'd write
to the Horse Guards, to have half-a-dozen sogers with shiny breast-
plates and drawn swords at the door, in disguise as a guard of honour,
but raelly to protect us. “'Twould be only doin the handsome thing
to the star-spangled banner,” said BARNUM ; and he'd sit a bitin his
pen, and then, like an independent citizen of the freest nation of airth,
he'd fling it away with a kinder toss, as much as to say, “No, Gen'ral,
we won't be obleeged to the critters.”
Well, with all this shindy a goin on, I ses one day to BARNUM–
“How is it, BARNUM,” ses I, “that these Britishers do make sich a
tearin noise about everything that's stranger-like * Everything
that's not of theirselves and their own country "
Whereupon BARNUM looking solemn upon me, and putting his
fore-finger erect up the side of his right cheek—for I like to be
particlar in this sort of thing, it gives a finish to writin, in the like
way as it does to paintin. In proof of which at this moment, there's
a Royal Cademician who'll get a hundred pound note for a pictur of a
cabbage-leaf, when another painter can't sell his Jupiters, Alexanders,
and sich things for the price of ile-cloth table mats. And wherefore? |
Why, the cabbage-leaf, everybody cries, is so rael. To be sure it is :
how could it miss 7 For doesn't the 'Cademician go to Covent Garden
and buy a rael leaf, and count all the leetle stalks and veins, and
paint every one on 'em 2 How then can it miss being rael and
natural Whereas for the pictur of JUPITER, whoever seed the
original to judge by ? And so, in course, the cabbage-leaf carries it ;
and so a good-sized summer cabbage is, whenever he likes, a hundred
pound note at least, in the pocket of that "Cademician. The rael
afore the ideal—the substance afore the shadow any day !
Well, BARNUM puts his fore finger up his right' cheek, and ses—
“Why does John Bull like foreigners afore his own Britishers ? I'll
tell you ; it all comes of his modesty.”
“What's that ?” ses I, for I'm wus nor a caterpillar if I'd ever
heerd him name the thing afore.
“Why, modesty,” ses BARNUM “is"—and then he did look in a tar-
nation fix. “Modesty, Gen'ral, is,” ses BARNUM ; and then he stopt
agin : no, he couldn't get it out : it seemed to stick like a leetle fish-
bone in his throat ; and the more he hummed and hawed, the more it
wouldn't come. At last, he takes a turn or two in the room to hide
his ignorance ; and then ses with a kinder deternlined manner, “Look
you here, Gen'ral, I'll explain this leetle question to you, by money.
I’ll illustrate what modesty raelly is, by what is called the coin of the
realm.”
“Is that possible 7" ses I, “Gov'nor.”
“Gen'ral,” replies BARNUM, solemn, “there is nothing—no moral pinte
on the airth that money will not illustrate, if you only know how to set
about it. Well, modesty is jist as stupid a thing as this; it is for all
the world as if a full weight goolden sov’reign was to insist upon going
for only nineteen shillins, and not a farden more. That is modesty ;
by which you will understand that modesty is always a thing that a
man loses by. Deny your full weight, though it be but a thousandth
part of a grain, and though you're put in a pair of scales, and balanced,
the world will swear that you don't weigh half you raelly do.
Modesty | Why it's as if a whole hog should beleettle himself down to
a suckin pig.” |
“What you’ve said about the goolden suv’reign, Governor,” ses I,
“has sunk into my heart. I’ll fancy meself that precious coin, and
never go for half-a-cent under it.”
“My dear Gen'ral, that won't do at all. By no means. No : the
true wisdom of this airth is for a man who thinks himself a goolden
suv'rain, to get twenty-seven—twenty-eight—aye, thirty shillings
for his goold ; and what's more, never—when he can get ’em —never
to refuse the extra ha'pence.”
BARNUM was goin on, when at the moment a thousand trumpets
seemed to blow on a sudden in the street—drums and clarinets struck
up—and the Gov'nor, with all his hair one end, run to the winder.
-
WHAT NEXT *
WE want a new definition of the phrase “Persons of Distinction.”
What can possibly be the meaning of it as applied in the following
paragraph 2–
“The Conde de Montemolin paid visits yesterday to several persons of distinction,
including MR. SHERIFF KINNEARD, MR. SHERIFF CHAllis, MR. UN de R-S11 ERIFF
TILLEARD, &c. &c.” -
Respectability has been defined as “keeping a gig ; ” Gentleman-
liness, as “occasionally discounting bills ; ” but if the above-named
worthy people be persons of distinction, what definition can possibly
include the DUKE of WELLING row and the Colonel of the Lumber
Troop, SIR Robert PEEL and MR. PETER BoRTHwick, LoRD MoRPETH
and MR. UNDER-SHERIFF TILLEARD 2
Coldness of the Season.
A LARGE block of ice, measuring we are afraid to state how many
feet, was exhibited last week in the window of the Wenham Lake Ice
Office in the Strand. Upon inquiring , we ascertained it had been
found in Walbrook Church, where the wind, and rain, and frost, have
the entrée through the roof and broken windows, all the year round.
It is called the Gibbs' Ice, and in coldness and thickness certainly
exceeds anything of the sort we have ever seen before. It is almost
impossible to melt it. The Wenham Lake Ice Company intends
using Walbrook Church as one of their coldest dépôts.
Close of the Vacation.
ORD JOHN RUSSELL, St. Stephen's House, Westminster, will expect to
meet his Young Friends, to resume their Liberal Studies, on the 19th instant.

RE-APPEARANCE OF THE AMERICAN SEA-SNARE.
uring the last week the newspapers have given authenticated accounts
of the appearance of the great Sea-snake somewhere off the shores
of Norway. The good Bishop PontoPPIDAN, in his veracious his-
tory, avers that he once saw a mermaid arise off the same coast,
and heard her sing a touching melody. Hence, Norway would seem
a favourite spot for the private view of marine monsters. Be this as
it may,+on Wednesday the 30th ult, the great North-American sea-
| snake was seen by thousands and tens of thousands of most respectable
people—people who keep gigs and carriages—residing in London and
its environs. Nay, every one of our ministers saw it—the Governor
of the Bank of England beheld it, and lifted up his hands—ALDERMAN
LAURIE marked it, and doubtless thought it ought to be “put down”
—in fact, we cannot individualize the multitude, astonished on Wed-
nesday the 30th ult. at the advent of the long American Sea-snake.
This, however, we can do. We can give the evidence of a few of the
.* as delivered before the LoRD MAYor—that great Christmas CARRol—on the follow-
1ng day :—
MR. John SMITH, banker, deposed : He was in the parlour of his counting house yesterday
morning, about eleven o'clock. He took up the Times, and became exceedingly alarmed by
the appearance of a compact mass of blackness that lay upon the page. Looked closer at
it, and thought he saw the “President's Speech,” but was convinced from the length of the
thing—for it wound in and out, filling up nine columns ; a mass of darkness, with not a
speck of light upon it—that it was nothing less than the American Sea-serpent, that from
time to time has disturbed the usual current of news, overflowing the margin of the brond
sheet. Witness tried to look at the thing minutely and attentively with his spectacles,
but became so alarmed that he was compelled to desist. He could swear, however, that
the whole thing seemed wriggling and twisting, and bore a very black complexion from
beginning to end.
MR. THOMAS BRown, merchant, examined :—
Lives in the Old Jewry, and distinctly saw the
monster alluded to between the hours of ten and
eleven, A.M. At first, thought the thing had
neither head nor tail. Believed it, at first, to
be composed of a mass of unconnected bits that
gave it the semblance of a whole ; in the like
way that a shoal of very little fish has been mis-
taken for one big whale. On closer examination,
thought he made out something like a head.
Having steadily observed it for some time, saw
it had a head. It had a very sinister, in fact,
a very disgusting, appearance. There was a
wicked expression in its eyes—an affectation of
mildness and benevolence ; but it was plain to
be seen—to men who had ever used their
faculties—that the creature looked revengeful,
and sly, and calculating. It was very sinuous,
and moved very slowly ; but was of a character
to create a'great displacement wherever it should
appear. The thing had been called a “Mess AGE,”
but was confident, from its length, its sinuosity,
and continual doubling, that the thing was no
other than the great American Sea-snake.
John Joseph LAwson, printer, examined:—
The thing described by the foregone witnesses
was the North American Snake, and no other ,
knew it well, nobody better; and could testify,
with the last witness, to the great displacement
of matter wherever it appeared. Some notion
of its voracity might be entertained from the
fact that it swallowed nine columns of the Times.
Hoped never again to see it; as nobody knew so
well as witness its gluttonous qualities. The
thing had certainly been very much cut up ;
but had no doubt it would appear again.
Thought its head had a very Pennsylvanian
look, with something projecting over its eyes,
like the broad brim of a hat. The end of the
thing tapered off not unlike the thongs of a slave-
driver's whip. -

CHRISTMAS BOOKS FOR MEN OF BUSINESS.
AMoxo the whole number of Christmas Books, we observe none
addressed to men of business. To be sure, there are plenty of cash and
memorandum books, but these are not the books that we have in our
eye. We think there is an opening for Christmas Books appealing to
men of the world. It is not everybody that is endowed with benevo-
lent sympathies; those of a large class are purely financial. We can
imagine a Christmas Book adapted to their capacities, of the nature of
which the following, which may be supposed to be the conclusion to it,
will give an idea :-
“The carriage was waiting at the warehouse door, and in it sat the aged but wealthy
bride. UNCLE: Dibbs detained SIDNEY a moment on the threshold.
“‘Aha! Sid," exclaimed the old gentleman, racily grinning as he jingled the cash in
his side pockets. “Will you quarrel with your old uncle now * Will you talk to me
now of your-what was it—crushed affections? Eh 7 Ha! ha : *
“‘Nay, nay, Uncle, I was green then."
“‘A hundred thousand in the Three Per Cents., eh? Thirty ditto in Railway Shares,
eh 2 The whole of Bullion Terrace and Sterling's Rents - eh? IIa ha! ha. A little
better than ANGrlin A and Camden Town—eh . "
“‘I should think so,” answered the young man.
“‘Did I not well, you dog, to intercept the—ha, ha! the billet dour.” demanded
the senior, uttering the last words in a tone of mock tenderness.
“‘You did, Uncle, you did."
““Spoon ER and ANGELINA Doves in a cage | Camden Town and two guineas a
week! Don't you envy them—eh? With Widow Consols—now Mrs. IBRADs—Eh!"
And MR. DiBiaspoked his nephew in the side and slapped his back.
*** Uncle,” exclaimed Sidney, “you were right, and I was an ass. There's an end
of that. And so now for our honeymoon; which, believe me, will often be sweetened
by the recollection of your favourite maxim, “Blunt before Beauty.’”

The Political Tea-Party.
In the present state of fusion, or confusion, of politics, it is
probable that party distinctions in Parliament will be obliterated.
There will muster, however, next session, a body of Repealers, in
the cause of Green IIyson, who may be expected to form a small tea-
party. It is said that they will invite the Cabinet to Tea and Turn-Out.

WRONGS OF AMERICA.—FAT OF MEXICO !
THE speech of PRESIDENT Polk would draw tears from a
Pennsylvanian debtor or a Virginian slave-holder. That big
bully, Mexico, has been kicking, and biting, and scratching the
Model Republic, that, like CINDERELLA by the fire-side, has
never used her nails, hardly wagged her tongue. At last,
however, when says Polk, “Mexico seemed to attribute to
weakness and indecision on our part, a forbearance which
was the offspring of magnanimity, and of a sincere desire to
preserve friendly relations with a sister republic,” why, then
the Model Republic suddenly jumped up and laid about her.
However, America is now greatly revenged, and is very
grateful. She has destroyed cities, murdered multitudes,
and now offers up thanks “to the Gracious Giver of all Good”
—for what ?—why, for “the vast extension of their territorial
limits.” A century or two ago one HERRERA (Polk, no
doubt, in a previous state of existence) describing the conquests
of the Spaniards over the Mexicans, in which the Indians
drew off and left the field to their victors, too fatigued to
follow, writes—“As soon as we found ourselves clear of
them, we returned thanks to God for his mercy, and entering a
strong and spacious temple, we dressed our wounds with the fat
of the Indians /" "And in the nineteenth century, wounded
North America dresses her imaginary sores with the fat of
Mexican fellow Christians !
POLITICAL MOVEMENTS.
THE preparations for the ensuing parliamentary campaign
are proceeding on an extensive scale, and each party has been
sending round its circulars. SIR WALENTINE BLAKE has
addressed a circular to the section of the House of Commons,
which may be called the “Don't-mean-to-stand-any-nonsense”
party in the present Parliament. Among those who take an
interest in the affairs of the nation, without being members of
its legislature, are MR. BRIEFless, who has addressed a cir-
cular to his immediate friends, inviting them to a grand
political breakfast at his chambers, for the purpose of con-
sidering what attitude it will be proper for him to assume
under the present crisis. Mister Punch, as the head of the
great national party, has sent his usual circular, inviting all
his friends to his usual weekly banquets throughout the year,
with a view to his being supported in his leadership of both
Houses of Parliament.
THE
3Fine (PIb Gnglisſ) (Bentleman of tſje ºregent Jime.
I'LL sing you a fine oki song, improved by a modern pate,
Of a fine Old English Gentleman, who owns a large estate,
But pays the labourers on it at a very shabby rate.
Some seven shillings each a week for early work and late,
Gives this fine Old English Gentleman, one of the present time.
His hall so brave is hung around with picturer, all in rows,
Of oxen that have gained the prize at agricultural shows,
And pigs so fat that they can't see an inch before their nose ;
For the whole of his attention on his cattle he bestows,
Like a fine Old English Gentleman, one of the present time.
In winter's cold, when poor and old for some assistance call,
And come to beg a trifle at the portals of his hall,
He refers them to the workhouse, that stands open wide for all;
For this is how the parish great relieve the parish small,
Like this fine Old English Gentleman, one of the present time.
When any of his working men are bold enough to press
For a trifle more of wages in a season of distress,
He answers like a thorough-going man of business :—
“Must I pay this or that for work which I could get for less 2"
Says the fine Old English Gentleman, one of the present time.
But rolling years will onwards flow, and time, alas ! will fly,
And one of these fine days this fine Old Gentleman must die.
Ah l will he then bethink him, as he heaves life's latest sigh,
That he has done to others quite as he would be done by,
As the true Old English Gentleman did in the olden time 7

THE NEW DISCOVERY IN SURGERY.
TREATY INSURANCE OFFICE.
|
A Ponth AIT, AFTER BEAR d.
Louis-PHILIPPE made a threat a few weeks ago, that he would
summon a congress of kings for the purpose of drawing up a new set of
treaties, so that each European state might know what to do for the
future. The notion is not a bad one, but, considering the short lives of
treaties in general, we think it scarcely necessary to draw up any at
all. It would be much better to calculate the average duration of the
existence of a treaty, and then for each monarch to enter into two
heavy sureties to keep the peace in Europe during that period. When
the term had expired, any crowned head should be at liberty to renew
the treaty for the same period of years. The promised congress would
only involve a number of unpleasant questions upon recent events,
besides bringing parties into contact who would have a difficulty, if
kings are given to blushing, to look one another in the face. Louis-
PHILIPPE ought to be very much obliged to us for this new proposal
of insuring treaties, for he must know better than anybody that it has
been his peculiar good fortune to gain upon every one of his policies,
which required a tremendous deal of assurance.
PUNCH'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS.
GENTLEMEN,
BREvity is the soul of Punch ; he will not therefore, like
Polk, write you a letter as long, but not so lively, as a volume of Sam
Slick.
Your thanks are due to your national stars for the successful settle-
ment of the Oregon Question.
You will learn with regret that you are in a decided fix. With a
view to business you have marched into Mexico ; but you have no
business there. You are likely to meet with more drubbings than
dollars. You had better imitate a former King of France, with his
thirty thousand men, and march back again.
If you do not take care, you will involve yourself in a national debt.
You owe quite enough already; and I recommend you to pay it as soon
as possible.
I advise you to repudiate—not indebtedness, but—slavery.
Industry is more profitable, and less hazardous, than Annexation.
The amendment of the Law of Lynch is worthy of your consideration.
Gentlemen, I wish you a merry Session, and a happy New Year.

Iord George on Railways and Corn.
At the York Festival Lord GEoRGE BENTINck said the name of
STEPHENson (to whom be all honour.) would “be remembered by
every farmer whose corn was carried to market at 48, to 5s. per quarter
less than before.” Very good. But Lord GeoRGE forgot this slightly
vital point —Let his Lordship's predictions prove true, as of course they
will, and the British farmer will have no corn to carry.
SPORTS AND PASTIMES OF THE PEOPLE.
RUBBERs at whist are said to be common in the carriages of the
Eastern Counties Railway. We think Patience would be a more ap-
i.
propriate game.
THE public will have seen with considerable interest that means
have been discovered for performing the most difficult operations
without giving pain to the party upon whom it is necessary to operate.
A man may, it seems, have his legs cut from under him without his
knowing it, by the new process, while the drawing out of his teeth
becomes an agreeable excitement, which is so delightful that a boy
having been mulcted of a molar, clamoured loudly to have another
extracted, and only held his jaw when the dentist consented to oblige
1nn.
However desirable this invention may be in a surgical point of view,
we have every hope that it will soon be applied to the more delicate
operations of politics. How useful would it have been during the last
session, when the Conservative body had to undergo the painful process
of the cutting off of so many of its members | Had the new process
been known, the political amputations might have taken place without
any of that pain, amounting in some cases to direct mortification,
which ensued in several instances. Considering the frequent severings
that SIR Robert PEEL has been obliged to undergo, and the numerous
occasions upon which he will again most probably feel it necessary to
submit to amputations, the new process must be almost invaluable to
the Right Honourable Baronet.
As the plan is calculated to prevent pain in all cases of removal, we
should recommend its being tried on the next occasion of a removal
from office by Her Majesty's Ministers. This has always been a most
distressing operation, from the suffering it has inflicted on the parties
concerned ; and all the friends of humanity must be delighted at the
prospect there is of its becoming an entirely painless proceeding.
A WORACIOUS PIKE.
The stones have been so slippery along Fleet Street, that the City
turnpikeman has had the greatest difficulty in pursuing the carts to
levy his toll. The poor man has been so tired, from repeatedly falling,
that he has not been able, since the frost has set in, to follow the chase
with his usual ardour; or if he has started a cart or two, it has been
only to see the game fly right before him, without the possibility of
bagging a single toll. The sums, he says, he has lost in this way are
quite untold. He has represented his case to the Court of Aldermen,
and they have been generous enough to allow him to wear, during the
frosty weather, a pair of skates. He has been practising by moonlight
on the pavement in Piccadilly, and declares he can stand up against
|anything now, as he cannot imagine any customer or ice being half so
slippery as the wood pavement. The public may expect to have some
capital sport with this voracious pike. His hiding-place is the corner
of Chancery Lane, and he is to be brought out at any time, by any per-
son who wishes to tackle him, by means of a horse and cart. He will run
any distance after his prey, and has never been known to leave it till he
has secured it.
Wanted, a Lion.
ALEXANDRE DUMAs has gone over to Algiers to hunt lions ; but it
seems that there is not a lion to be had in the place, for love or money.
He talked of sending over for the British Lion, but was dissuaded by
being told that the poor animal had been so dreadfully hunted down in
his own country, that there was not a roar left in him. ALEXANDRE
DUMAs is dreadfully wroth at the Game-Laws not being better pre-
served in Algeria, and has registered a vow in his pocket-book to send
over, as soon as he arrives in Paris, a covey of young lions, from the
Jardin des Plantes. He has advertised for a “spirited young man"
for a gamekeeper, but as yet no one has come forward to accept the
heroic situation.
TOO MUCH OF A BAD THING.
Sowe wretched man, or bitter satirist, proposes that the Statue of
the Duke be set up at the point in Kensington Gardens where the eight
avenues converge, “so that the figure may be seen from eight different
points of view.” It would also be seen in eight points of view at once
by different persons. We do not know what the frequenters of Ken-
sington Gardens have done to deserve this, nor do we feel so malig-
nant y towards the Sub-committee as to inflict on them such a ven-
geance. -
PARDONABLE WEAKNESS.
PoAchERs have been pardoned by the QUEEN. “May not this be
called ”—asks GRANTLEY BERKELEY of Punch—“a pardonable weak-
ness 2"
AN APPROPRIATE ALIAs.-We observe that the London Medical
Directory is much advertised. As an additional title for this publica-
tion, we would suggest “The Red Lamp.”

THE TRIUMPH OF PANTOMIME.
S Parliament opens so much earlier this year,
the theatres will be able to introduce into their
pantomimes a new batch of tricks. They
might announce them, like the newsvenders of
the evening papers, as “Second Edition 1
Opening of Parliament Wonderful Fun
New Tricks Surprising Transformations !
Second Edition.” As their wishes, however,
might exceed their ability, we will provide
them with a set beforehand. which any mana-
ger is welcome to, upon his pledging his
word that neither of those very lugubrious
songs, “Hot Codlins,” or “Tippytiwitchet,”
shall ever be sung in his theatre again.
Here they are :—
“LoRD John Russell, as Harlequin jumping
through the House of Commons, and sticking half way, when PEEL,
as Pantaloon, comes behind him and pushes him through.”
“The Blarney Stone changing into Conciliation Hall.”
“PEEL's Portrait Gallery being turned into the weathercocks of the
new House of Commons.”
“MR. O'Connell, as the celebrated old woman who sells hot codlins,
to be quietly boiling his pot, when MASTER SMITH OBRIEN and a
number of little boys throw in a few squibs, and blow him and all his
concern up.”
“The National Gallery Lottery Office, with the announcement, “All
prizes—no blanks'—to be turned into an immense mangle, which Clown
is to be turning, as Pantaloon puts the pictures in. “Last day of draw-
ing the Old Masters.” All the prizes to turn out blanks.”
“An Agricultural Show, to be changed into a Tallow Chandler's shop.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XLVI.-CLUB SNOBS.
WHY does not some great author write “The Mysteries of the Club
Houses ; or St. James's Street unveiled.” It would be a fine subject
for an imaginative writer. We must all, as boys, remember, when we
went to the fair, and had spent all our money—the sort of awe and
anxiety with which we loitered round the outside of the show, specu-
lating upon the nature of the entertainments going on within.
Man is a Drama—of Wonder and Passion, and Mystery and
Meanness, and Beauty and Truthfulness, and Etcetera. Each Bosom
is a Booth in Vanity Fair. But let us stop this capital style, I should
die if I kept it up for a column (a pretty thing a column all capitals
would be, by the way). In a club, though there mayn't be a soul of
your acquaintance in the room, you have always the chance of
watching strangers, and speculating on what is going on within those
tents and curtains of their souls, their coats and waistcoats. This is a
never-failing sport. Indeed I am told there are some clubs in the
town where nobody ever speaks to anybody. They sit in the coffee-
room, quite silent, and watching each other.
Yet how little you can tell from a man's outward demeanour !
There's a man at our club—large, heavy, middle-aged—gorgeously
dressed—rather bald—with lacquered boots—and a boa when he goes
out ; quiet in demeanour, always ordering and consuming a récherché
little dinner, whom I have mistaken for Lord PockLINGTON any time
these five years, and respected as a man with five hundred pounds per
diem; and I find he is but a clerk in an office in the City, with not
two hundred pounds income, and his name is JUBBER. My LoRD
Pocklingron was, on the contrary, the dirty little snuffy man who
cried out so about the bad quality of the beer, and grumbled at being
overcharged threehalfpence for a herring, seated at the next table to
JUBBER on the day when some one pointed his lordship out to me.
Take a different sort of mystery. I see, for instance, old FAwNEY
stealing round the rooms of the Club, with glassy, meaningless eyes,
and an endless greasy simper—he fawns on everybody he meets, and
shakes hands with you, and blesses you, and betrays the most tender
and astonishing interest in your welfare. You know him to be a
quack and a rogue, and he knows you know it. But he wriggles on
his way, and leaves a track of slimy flattery after him wherever he
goes. Who can penetrate that man's mystery 2 What earthly good
can he get from you or me 2 You don't know what is working under
that leering tranquil mask. You have only the dim instinctive re-
pulsion that warns you, you are in the presence of a knave—beyond
which fact all FAwNEY's soul is a secret to you.
I think I like to speculate on the young men best. Their play is
opener. You know the cards in their hand, as it were. Take, for
example, MEssRs. SPAVIN and CoCKSPUR.
A specimen or two of the above sort of young fellows may be found,
I believe, at most Clubs. They know nobody. They bring a fine
smell of cigars into the room with them, and they growl together, in a
corner, about sporting matters. They recollect the history of that
short period in which they have been ornaments of the world by the
names of winning horses. As political men talk about “the Reform
year,” “the year the Whigs went out,” and so forth, these young
sporting bucks speak of Tarnation's year, or Opodeldoc's year, or the
year when Catawampus ran second for the Chester Cup. They play
atbilliards in the morning, they absorb pale ale for breakfast, and “top
up” with glasses of strong waters. They read Bell's Life (and a very
pleasant paper too, with a great deal of erudition in the answers to
correspondents). They go down to TATTERSALL's, and swagger in the
Park, with their hands plunged in the pockets of their paletots.
What strikes me especially in the outward demeanour of sporting
youth is their amazing gravity, their conciseness of speech, and care-
worn and moody air. In the smoking-room at the Regent, when JoE
MILLERson will be setting the whole room in a roar with laughter,
you hear young MEssRs. SPAviN and Cockspur grumbling together-in
a corner. “I’ll take your five-and-twenty to one about Brother to
Bluenose,” whispers SPAvis. “Can't do it at the price,” CocksPUR
says, waggling his head ominously. The betting-book is always
present in the minds of those unfortunate youngsters. I think I hate
that work even more than the Peerage. There is some good in the
latter — though, generally speaking, a vain record ; though DE
MUGGINs is not descended from the giant Hogyn MogYN ; though
half the other genealogies are equally false and foolish ; yet the
mottoes are good reading—some of them; and the book itself a sort of
gold-laced and liveried lackey to History, and in so far serviceable.
But what good ever came out of, or went into, a betting-book 2 If I
could be CALIPH OMAR for a week, I would pitch every one of those
despicable manuscripts into the flames ; from my Lord's, who is
“in” with JAck SNAFFLE's stable, and is over-reaching worse-informed
rogues and swindling greenhorns; down to SAM's, the butcher-boy's,
who books eighteen-penny odds in the taproom, and “stands to win
five-and-twenty bob.”
In a turf transaction, either SPAVIN or Cockspur would try to get
the better of his father, and, to gain a point in the odds, victimize his
best friends. One day we shall hear of one or other levanting; an
event at which, not being sporting men, we shall not break our hearts.
See—MR. SPAviN is settling his toilette previous to departure; giving
a curl in the glass to his side-wisps of hair. Look at him 1 It is

PUNCH*S POLITICAL DICTIONARY.
OATH. A form of words administered by the usher in a court of
justice to witnesses and jurymen. In the case of the former it is a solo,
but in the case of the latter it is a quartette, the jurymen swearing in
little parties of four to save trouble. If a person, about to be examined,
refuses to take an oath, he is treated as unworthy of belief, though his
very conscientiousness shows that he is more likely to speak the truth
than one who does not hesitate to take any oath that may be required.
| Besides the oaths of witnesses, there are certain oaths which are sworn,
apparently, for the mere purpose of putting a shilling into the pockets
of the officer of the court, who is entitled to that fee on taking an affi-
davit. Barristers and attorneys on their admission to practice take an
oath of allegiance, by which they swear that they will not kill foreign
princes in the streets, or invite the Pope over to Windsor Castle.
OFFERINGs, EASTER. Contributions to the income of a clergyman,
and called offerings, from his offering to take them to any extent that
his parishioners may be pleased to offer him.
OFFICIAL. Of or belonging to office. That sort of conduct which, in
an individual's private capacity, would be characterised as unfeeling or
dishonourable, passes without censure when the adjective official can
be attached to it. Official sometimes has the effect of the Greek
negative a when prefixed to a word, and thus “Official politeness”
signifies, no politeness at all ; “Official dispatch” means extreme delay;
and “Official occupation” a state of utter idleness.
OLIGARCHY. Government by the few ; a state in which the rulers
are rather more select than numerous. To illustrate the matter by an
humble case in point, we may say that the Exeter Arcade is a
monarchy, for it is ruled by one beadle, while Burlington Arcade,
which has two beadles, a policeman, and a porter, may be compared to
an oligarchy. Blackfriar's Pier, which is ruled by a check-taker and
two Jacks-in-the-Water, may be called a triumvirate, for the policeman,
who knocks the boys about with his staff, can only be considered as a
lick-tor. Hungerford Pier, where there are several check-takers, all
quarrelling with each other, and a number of watermen, who do
nothing but scramble for the passengers and abuse each other, must be
regarded as a Commonwealth, in which the public money seems to be
treated as wealth common to all who will make a snatch at it.
ORDINARY. A term given to the Bishop of the diocese, as well as to
a dinner served up in a tavern at a certain hour for any one to partake
of Why Bishops are called Ordinaries is not exactly known, for some
of them pursue a most extraordinary line of conduct. The word ordi-
nary, which means also plain, is well adapted to the humble, and of
course plain, meal we have alluded to.
OUTLAwry is literally the process of being placed beyond the law,
though, in fact, it is generally the preliminary to getting into it. There
is still in existence a small band of outlaws, who are proclaimed
periodically at the Sheriff's Court; but they are not entitled to be
called bold outlaws, for they frequently consist entirely of runaways. ...

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 25
HIGH ART.
It is with the nicest feeling of appreciation, and the most salient
relish for high art, that we have caused a series of sketches in outline
—wretched, we own, when compared with those of the tremendous
RErsch—to be prepared for the illustration of our columns. Being
desirous of bringing out the powers of the artist in the fullest
possible manner, we placed the pleasing poem of “High diddle diddle"
unreservedly in his hands, as a morceau that a RAPHAEL might have
given ten minutes of his valuable life to illustrate. We selected the
theme for various reasons, but chiefly on account of the German mys-
ticism of the subject. There is a magic beauty in the opening line, a
sort of dreary incantation, or rather invocation, of the high, the lofty,
the elevated; and the “diddle diddle,” which is finely expressive of the
veiled, the mysterious, and the ideal. The tranquil and measured
calmness of the versification of “High diddle diddle” prepares us for
the introduction of “The cat and the fiddle.” The combination seems
at first strange, of a puss and a violin, but when we remember that the
strings of a fiddle are made of catgut, it is not surprising that between
the animal and the instrument there is an inward sympathy. The
artist has indeed seized the cat with exceeding cleverness, and thrown
into the violin a degree of tone that is truly marvellous.
But how beautiful is the transition from the calm quietude of the
mouse-trap of private life engaged in gentle harmony—how beautiful
we say is the transition to the violent action of the frolicsome quad-
ruped. When we are told that “The cow jumped over the moon,”
we take a mental somersault in the company of the eccentric animal.
We fancy the cow running furiously into the Milky Way, and leaping
over Luna like a lunatic. The illustrator of this singular incident in
our vaccine annals has caught the situation with surprising fidelity.
When we look at the picture, we fancy we can hear the breathing of
the cow, in spite of all the rules of acoustics which tell us the contrary.
When looking at the juxta-position of the moon and the cow, we become
overwhelmed by the oddness of the association, and the bewilderment
of the moon-calf comes suddenly over us.
But it is in the last grand tableau that the master mind of the artist
is visible. It is when he has to bring into the same group not only the
cat and the fiddle, and the cow performing its saltatory feat, but the
little dog laughing “to see such sport”, and the dish in the very act of
decamping with the table spoon. How truthfully is all this told in the
composition before us.
Do we not begin to hold both our sides in sympathy with the little
dog, whose laughter to “see such sport” the artist so delicately indi-
cates? As to the dish, it is a feast of itself, and we devour it with
that keen appetite which a hunger for high Art is sure to originate.
When we see the spoon we are literally carried away with it. Between
one point and the other of this remarkable picture, what with the spoon
and the fiddle, we begin to feel as fiddle-headed as either or both of
them.
We strongly advise the Committee of the Art-Union to distribute a
set of these engravings, done in outline, to the next year's subscribers.
ARE THERE ANY POLICEMEN ?
A Correspond ENT suggests that the police, who have nothing to do
save to find out the area of every house—a little problem, the solution
of which is generally XXX—should be employed during the day in
sweeping the streets. As new brooms sweep cleanest, there may be a
chance, he says, of a little of the mud, which is so very plentiful in this
soluble weather, being cleared away before next Mid-ummer. The
great advantage of this sweeping measure would be the possibility of
finding a policeman when one was wanted, instead of having to run
into the next county in search of one. We know a lady who maintains
that the police went out at the same time as the hackney coaches. It
is perfectly true that it is as difficult, in the present day, to hail one as
the other. We hope in a short time to see the curious phenomenon of
one of the letters of the alphabet—we have no preference—busily
engaged in ordering a mud-cart in Fleet Street to “move on ” as he
“takes up” a chain of miniature Apennines of dirt.
THE SPREAD OF BITUMEN.
According to the French papers, bitumen has been allowed to enter
the ports of Algeria free of duty. We are at a loss to imagine what
can be the great demand for bitumen in Algeria. Is it to smooth the
way in that country for MARshal BUGEAUD, and so to enable him to
walk over the natives 2 Is it to make the natives forget their native
soil, by hiding it from them * or is it to cut the ground from under
ABD. El-KADER's feet 2 or, stretching a point, is it to put the entire of
Africa under the pressure of the French flag 2 We cannot in the least
account for this extraordinary liberality in bitumen, unless, as it is
well-known that it is melted by the heat of the sun, it is sent over as
so much bird-lime, for the purpose of catching ABD-EL-KADER when he
passes over it. At all events, it is a capital expedient for tracing the
footsteps of that fugitive hero, though we must say we think it is rather
too bad that Louis PHILIPPE should be allowed to pitch it all his own
way in Algeria.
“BUBBLE BUBBLE, TOIL AND TROUBLE.”
It has been discovered that there are springs which throw up boiling
ponds in all parts of New Zealand. When Nature performs such
freaks as these, who can be surprised at the inhabitants of New
Zealand being always in hot water 7

THE ROOFLESS QUADRANT.
THE Quadrant has lately been turned into a
shower-bath. The roof forms one of the exhibi-
tions of the metropolis; it is open from morning
till dusk. The rain drips through, and the pedes-
trian who has folded up his umbrella under the
delusion he is under shelter, is astonished to find
when he emerges into the open air, that he is as
wet through as if he had been sitting inside
Walbrook Church. If it is the intention to turn
the Quadrant into a public washhouse, notice
should be given of the fact, and the beadles
should be provided with the necessary towels,
combs, and brushes; whereas at present a run
through the Quadrant costs a new hat, besides

PROSPECTS OF THE SESSION.
A SONG FOR LORD JOHN RUSSELL.
WITH one thing and another, what anxiety and bother,
What perplexity and trouble, and confusion I am in ;
I seem all hurry-skurry, in a flurry, and a worry,
Now the session Parliamentary is going to begin.
The work of Legislation will be such a complication.
That how shall I unravel it I'm puzzled how to think :
We shall be so very busy, the idea makes me dizzy,
And from the undertaking I am half inclined to shrink.
There's the Sanatory question for discussion and digestion,
There's the Smoke-prevention measure—there's the Duty upon Tea:
I’ve to settle Church Preferment, and to regulate Interment,
And the Malt-tax abolition must be grappled with by me.
On the Buildings' Act revision I must come to some decision,
And waggon-loads of Railway bills must manage to get through :
With the press of business-matter, and the talking and the chatter,
Upon my life I can't conceive whatever I shall do.
And I shall have to answer them, or yield to their demand;
There 'll be both Free Trade Extension and the Burdens upon Land.
And the diplomatic kettle I of fish shall have to settle,
And all I know about the Spanish Marriage to reveal ;-
Oh! humbly as a spaniel, let me beg, my dearest DANIEL,
In this trying situation not to plague me with Repeal.
Then a scheme of Education I must furnish for the nation,
Which Inglis will be trying to cut up in smithereens ;
And amid all these transactions, and the cavillings of factions,
I shall have to set to work about devising Ways and Means.
Worst of all, the monster question there remains, whose bare suggestion
Makes every hair upon my head to bristle up on end,
With Ireland and her evils I am call'd on to contend.
Oh, how badger'd, bored and harass'd, how cross-question'd and
embarrass'd,
How banter'd, teas'd and taunted, and tormented, I shall be l
With a prospect so appalling, can I hope to keep from falling,
Or help exclaiming wildly, “Oh, what will become of me?”.
Ah l ye men in Opposition, do not envy my condition,
I am sure you can't imagine at this moment what I feel ; -
Such a sinking there comes o'er me, when I think of what's before me,
That I almost could repent me that we ever ousted PEEL.
WINTER FASHIONS

IN consequence of the prevailing
habit of going upon the ice, some
fashions have been brought out that
are suitable to the very dangerous
exercise. Among the most elegant is
a monkey jacket of cork, with a
wooden garniture placed en lamp-
lighter's ladder along the lower part of
it, and terminating in four points, two
in front and two at the back of the
Wearer.
We have also seen a novelty in
hats, which is well adapted to the
perilous pastime of sliding
or skating on the Serpen-
tine. The top of the hat
is of cork, en parasol, and
instead of the customary
tassel, there is a ball of
string, as well as a large
hook, which enables the
bearer to be hooked out or

From the Log of a Commercial Gent.
Dec. 18th. Joined the convoy at Darlington, 4 P.M., weather squally
and threatening. The train is fitted to encounter snow. We have two
engines, and an ice-plough on the buffer of the leader. The guard—an
old hand, to whom I made some remark on the subject before we
started—looked hard to the N.E., and screwed up his weather-beaten
features with an “Aye, aye, Sir, we shall have a dirty night of it.”
The watch in the carriage where I am stationed consists of a stout
Quaker, an old lady with a large basket and a child, another commer-
cial gent besides myself, and a Scotchman. We are all in high spirits,
and look forward to our reaching the extreme northern point of Edin-
burgh with hopeful cheerfulness,

6 P.M. Squally; snow-clouds N.N.E. Spoke an up-train.
7 P.M. Ferrybridge in sight, bearing W. and by W. A few snow
flakes have already fallen. Ordered up the weather window.
8 P.M. Snow falling fast. No house in sight. Guard reports drift
snow ahead. Train labouring a good deal. Got out railway wrapper,
and made all snug.
10 P.M. Train making little way. Drift on the line increasing. The
old lady is getting nervous.
11 P.M. Overhauled the log. We ought to have made Newcastle by 7.
Attempted to make an observation to the guard, but could not procure
a civil answer. Observed a cow looking over the embankment.
11% P.M. Station-lights reported ahead. Train hardly making any
way. Drift very high, and snow falling so fast that we cannot show
ourselves on deck.
12 P.M. We have not yet made the station. The old lady has
brought out a bottle, and served out a dram to the watch. Quaker
gent refuses it, as being a teetotaller.
12% A.M., The Quaker gent has begged for a little brandy—“to be
taken medicinally.” Got up all our wraps to be ready for any emer-
gency. Train pitching a good deal ; engine, whistling perpetually.
1 A.M. Train brought up all standing. Floe-ice and hummocks
round about. Air thick, and carriage leaking. The other commercial
gent swears a good deal about the markets. The old lady appears to
be engaged in inward devotion. Thank Heaven the child has not yet
| begun to cry.
2 A.M. Remained in the same position. Scotch gentleman remarks
“It’s a coarse night,” which nobody seems inclined to deny.
6 A.M. Still stationary. Nothing in sight but walls of snowdrift.
* other commercial gent has attempted to open the door without
ect.
9 A.M. Daybreak. All very miserable. The coals are used up, and
the train imbedded in nearly fifteen feet of snowdrift. The old lady has
of the brandy medicinally, and is talking incoherently. The Scotch-
man observes that we shall be “unco late at E'embro,” which is gene-
rally admitted to be probable.
10 A.M. Native seen at a distance. Signals of distress made, but not
responded to. Proposed to overhaul provisions. Reported stores as
follows, viz.:-
QUAKER. One packet of sandwiches,
CoMMERCIAL GENT. Two cigars, one small toothcomb, half stick sealing
war, and false collar highly starched.
peppermint drops, pork pie in paper, piece French chalk, ditto waz candle-
end, pint of brandy.
Scotch MAN. Nothing whatever.
SELF. Packet of cheroots, small bottle lavender water, one pot bear's grease.
All this I took charge of, by consent of the rest.
11 A.M. Addressed the crew of my carriage on our situation. Old
lady resigned. Quaker still confused from effects of medicine.
Commercial gent (in his own opinion) funny, and Scotchman inclined
to dispute everything said by anybody else. Served out breakfast,
consisting of the old lady's captain's biscuits and allowance of brandy,
one thimbleful (by old lady's thimble) to each, except child. Com-

resistance will soon be idle.

a cigar.
4 P.M. After a dreadful struggle, in which I am sorry to say the old
lady took part, the pie has fallen into the hands of the mutineers, who
singing “We won't go home till morning,” which the commercial gent
has taught him.
5 P.M. The provisions are all gone. The commercial gent is now
sucking the starch out of his collar. The Scotchman has wheedled the
old lady out of her peppermint drops, which he is at this moment
not open the windows.

10, next morning. The sufferings of the night have been dreadful.
4 P.M. The guard has not returned ; probably he has fallen a victim
to his noble self-devotion. His comrade has gone after him. They
have both, no doubt, stuck fast, and perhaps perished!
5 P.M. A passenger has just discovered that the two selfish brutes
of guards have been, for the last hour, enjoying themselves among the
quantity, but enough remains to serve out a sparing meal to all the
train. The Quaker is sober again, and appears penitent. The Scotch-
man secured by great violence a barrel of oysters, all of which he has
eaten himself, keeping off the hungry with his oyster-knife.
6, P.M. Four engines reported in sight, attempting to get through
the drift ahead. 'Evins prosper the attempt 1

On coming down-stairs, found the Scotchman eating the former, and
two hours after, on going up-stairs, found same identical gent sleeping
in the latter.

The Police Footnan.
It is very evident that MR. DANIEL WHITTLE HARVEY knows what
use a policeman ought to be put to, for he made one into a domestic
servant. The City Commissioner was perfectly aware that a police-
man is never so completely at home as in the kitchen. There can be
no doubt that the situation of footman to MR. DANIEL WHITTLE
HARVEY must have been delightful to a member of the force who, we
believe, urged that he was induced to enter the service out of regard
for one of the collateral branches of MR. HARVEY's family. On enquiry
it turned out that the fellow cared little for the HARVEYs, but had an
intense attachment to the Whittles. ,
A MODEL MESSAGE.
It is to be hoped that the President's next message to Congress will
be transmitted by the Electric Telegraph. In that case, its necessary

| Mr. Punch respectfully begs to remind Members of the House of
Commons that Parliament will assemble on Tuesday the 19th instant,
for the despatch of business. He ventures to repeat—for the despatch
of business; because it appears to him to be generally forgotten that
this is the object of the meeting of Parliament.
In order to the due despatch of business, Mr. Punch may perhaps be
allowed to tender to the House of Commons a little advice. With very
much more than the usual work this Session, there must be very much
less than the usual talk.
| Honourable Members who have nothing to say are strongly recom-
mended to say it.
It is desirable that all speeches should be as closely compressed as
possible. Every sentence should be an aphorism ; if not new, at least
true; and in any case should have some bearing on the question before
the House.
References to the Eton Latin Grammar and the Elegant Extracts
should be dispensed with ; and the Speaker of the House should check
any quotation from ENFIELD's.
Unmeaning cant is to be sedulously avoided ; and the British Lion,
the Wisdom of our Ancestors, and our Glorious Constitution, are on no
pretence whatever to be invoked or alluded to.
That these requirements may be observed, it is suggested that every
Member before speaking should give himself the trouble of thinking.
Members who have statistical or arithmetical details to bring for-
ward, should have them printed on large boards, to be hoisted for in-
spection during the delivery of their speeches; the recital of such
matters being lengthy and impossible to follow.
Personality breeds altercation, altercation waste of time; it is there-
fore earnestly entreated that all Members will, if they possibly can,
abstain from impugning one another's motives, or calumniating, as-
persing, and vilifying each other. MR. DisBAELI, it is hoped, will turn
over a new leaf.
CoLoREL SIBTHoRPE is implored to be sparing of his witticisms.
All unnecessary questions and applications for useless returns are
deprecated. This Session, also, Members really should refrain from
utting, or at least from pressing to a division, motions which they
É. to be hopeless.
A Committee of at least a dozen wise men, if so many can be found
in the House, should be appointed to determine the claims of such
questions, applications, and motions to attention.
It is most expedient that all matters of privilege should be pooh-
poohed.
If these hints are carefully acted upon, it is just possible that Par-
liament may get through the business of the country by the end of
August.
A STAND-UP FOR SMITHFIELD.
A GREAT deal of clamour has been lately raised for the removal of
Smithfield Market, and the establishment of abattoirs in the suburbs.
As some excuse for this outcry, it is urged that about two or three
deaths, on an average, occur weekly, in consequence of cattle being
driven through the streets. But if a few people die by Smithfield, a
great many live by it. Besides, not everybody that is tossed is killed.
Last week a gentleman, in Kingsgate Street, High Holborn, was at-
tacked by an infuriated bull : he was only trampled on, and gored. On
the same day in Long Lane a boy was knocked down by a bullock.
He may have been severely wounded, but still he was picked up alive.
Accidents like these only strengthen the argument for retaining
Smithfield Market where it is. We allude of course to vested interests.
| These casualties show that besides the Corporation, publicans, and
others who are interested in the maintenance of Smithfield, there is
that respectable body of men, the surgeons. There are also the pupils
and teachers of St. BARTHoLoMEw's Hospital, which, by the provident
wisdom of our ancestors, adjoins the market.
The removal of Smithfield may save a few lives ; but it will disturb
the amicable relations between the College of Surgeons and the Court
of Aldermen. These relations ought to be preserved ; and for standing
so manfully as they have done by Smithfield, we advise the Council of
the College to give the Aldermen a dinner. Let the first toast on the
removal of the cloth be, “Smithfield and Surgery.”
GOOD SEORT FOR PUNCH.
“Mr. Punch,
“I Belongs to the class o' people called tenant-farmers.
Now, Zur, the bit o' land as Iockypies is overrun wi' game. You oodn't
credit the mischief the pheasants and harses and rabbits does me.
| They ates me, Zur, well nigh out o' house and whoam, they do. Talk
o' rats and mice. grubs and cattypillars, they be nothun to 'em. But I
can't help myself. This here game all belongs to my landlord, and
I can't touch a head on't. And now we shall soon ha the sason over,
and there'll be an end o' shootin. But I be told, Mr. Punch, as how
you've got a licence to sport all the year round. I wish you'd just
take your gun, and bring dog Twoaby along witun, and come down to
my pleace, and kill off these here warmunt for me. Or in case my
landlord should ax 'ee to dine witun, persuade un to make me zome
allowance for what the game destroys. If he's to feed it off my
property, he might as well turn out hogs, and sheep, and poultry over
the estate, in the zame way. But you come down wi' your gun at all
events, and bring as many friends as you like along with 'ee. Depend
'pon't, you'll never find fairer game than what devours my crops.
“Your most obagent Sarvant,

THE PUNCH ANECDOTES.
WANITY.
WE forget at present where we met with the following
anecdote.—Mr. C. *** was a man of great fashion, but
he marred all his good qualities by an excess of osten-
tation. Not content with being a gentleman he was
always aspiring to pass for a nobleman. He drove a
carriage drawn by two miserable hackney-coach
horses, and he had a servant stuck up behind in
effigy and made of hay and straw. Being at the
Opera one evening, where all the carriages followed in a
string, the horses behind the carriage of Mr. C * * *
ate up the two legs of the servant, and the body fell
under the carriage. Upon inquiring where his servant
had gone to, the coachman of the following vehicle
* replied, “Oh, he's just this minute gone, sir, to feed
the horses.” The following morning, a truss of straw
was left at his house, with the message that “it was
the new servant who had come to fill the vacant place.” The joke never
stopped, and he was continually subject to bills “For a new pair of legs
and an arm to your servant,” and so forth, till a sample of hay-seed
being sent to him which was “warranted to produce the finest crop of
footmen,” he took it so much to heart, that he left for America, where
§: was told there were no servants, and has not returned to the present
ay.
Fiddlers are noted for their vanity; hence the expression, probably,
of a person who is very vain, “playing first fiddle.” BARon NATHAN,
“who plays the fiddle like an angel,” is not free from this failing. A
lady of quality said of him one evening at Rosherville, “The Baron, as
soon as he has done playing, should be treated like his fiddle—put
into a case and carried home.”
An American was bragging about his country, saying that “Union
was Strength.” “I will give you a better motto than that,” said an
Englishman, ‘Union is Repudiation.”
CHARLEs KEAN is rather vain of his name. He was playing Romeo
one night. When Juliet came to the exclamation of “What's in a
. STUART, who was behind the scenes, cried out, “Fifteen pounds
a night.” ---
The pedigree of a Welchman, which was written on parchment, was
devoured by a rat. Will it be believed he had this animal kept in
a beautiful cage, and used to show it to his friends as “the literal
descendant of Adam.”
Many persons are vain of being ugly. MALHERBE declared that if
an apple was to be dropt on the earth, with the inscription, “To the
ugliest,” the number of persons who would rush forward to claim it
would be something awful. He knew a Frenchwoman who was dread-
fully jealous of another, and he never could understand the reason, as
it would have puzzled the greatest connoisseur to decide which was the
uglier; till he heard one of them say, in a violent passion, “You need
not be proud, Madam, if you have a mole on your nose more than I have.”
A NATION OF ADVERTISERS.
DVERTISEMENTs are spreading
all over England,-they have
crept under the bridges—have
planted themselves right in the
middle of the Thames—have
usurped the greatest thorough-
fares—and are now just on the
point of invading the omnibuses.
Advertising is certainly the
great vehicle for the age. Go
where you will, you are stopped
by a monster cart running over
with advertisements, or are
advertising house put upon
wheels, which calls upon you,
when too late, not to forget
Y “Number One.” These vehicles,
one would think, were more than
enough to satisfy the most greedy lover of advertisements, but it seems
there is such an extraordinary run for them that omnibuses are to be
lined and stuffed with nothing else. How will you like sitting for an
hour opposite to a pleasant list of the wonderful cures by some Profes-
sor’s Ointment 2 or how will ladies like being stared in the face, all
nearly knocked down by an
delicacy as for their truth, and do not form the kind of reading we
should exactly prescribe to the fairer portion of the public which patro-
nise omnibuses. Besides, what kind of advertisement is the conductor
to refuse? Has he directions to say, when any objectionable advertise-
A HINT TO CABMEN,
ment applies for admission, “Full inside f" Or are all the quack adver-
testimonials of these gifted gentlemen are as little noted for their
tisements to be compelled to get outside, likewasherwomen and butchers? |
It matters very little, for the system
of resorting to such a vehicle for ad
vertisements, is in our opinion mis-
placed altogether. We are haunted
with advertisements enough in
all shapes, tricks, and disguises.
The Penny Post has increased the
distribution of them most prolifi-
cally. Half of our billets-doua end
with an eloquent appeal to run to
some cheap grocer's, and buy a
pound of his best Hyson ; and the
bill-stickers are indefatigable in
making known the virtues of every
new discovery in strops, drugs,
novels, poisons, and “poses plas-
tiques.” As we have pantomimes,
papers, broadsides, circulars, hand-
bills, and fashionable stories, for
advertising, do in mercy allow us
to ride for a day's pleasure to Rich-
mond, or to go to the Bank to
receive our dividends, without com-
pelling us to sit vis-à-vis to Moses
& SoN, or having Rowland's
Kalydor perpetually thrown in our
faces.
Let us be a nation of shopkeep-
ers as much as we please, but there
is no necessity that we should
become a nation of advertisers.
We say most emphatically to the
gentlemen who have announced
their advertising omnibuses—“We
prefer your room to your Com-
pany.”
AN EDITOR IN THE CLOUDS.

If
wanderings.
“copy" when he selected a cloud as a subject for his lucubrations.
OUR sagacious contemporary, the Shrewsbury Journal, has devoted
ten lines of very powerful writing to the description of a very “remark-
able cloud,” which he appears to have encountered in one of his
his brother journalists were all to follow his example, we should find
the papers even more misty and obscure than they sometimes are
when they discourse upon politics.
It is true that the clouds can
scarcely present a more shifting and uncertain aspect than that of
public affairs at the present time ; and a writer may as well go at
once to the original thing as take for a theme the mere counterpart.
Our Shrewsbury friend tells us that his cloud had “the form of a
dagger,” and it is only to be regretted that he could not get hold of the
point for the purpose of putting it into his article.

the celebrated Iron Cage (something like the stalls at the St. James's | ---
Theatre), in which the prisoner could neither lie, sit, nor stand, but
was obliged to maintain an anomalous position, composed of all three ||
together. He is considered to have established the regal power in
France against the great vassals, at an immense expense of lies, poison-
ings, assassinations, and other crimes, the change for which was not
taken out till the French Revolution. He was remarkable for choosing
his associates and ministers from the dregs of the people. His barber
was his principal assistant, both in shaving himself and his people.
His right-hand man was TRistan L'HERMITE who united the functions
of head of the police and hangman; who always had a drop in his
eye, and invariably travelled with a halter in his pocket. ... This man,
with the captain of his archers, he was accustomed to call “the two
strings to his bow.” He was much attached to Scotchmen, and main-
tained a body-guard of this economical people, at a very small expense.
He attempted to trick the Saints by exactly the same “dodge” as he
employed against the crown vassals, giving them enormous promissory
notes for churches, lands, and images one day, and allowing them to be
dishonoured the next.
A BURGLARY of the most daring description known for years has
been committed against Mr. Punch; and it shows the dangerous con-
dition of literary property in the present day, that though the perpe-
|trators of this audacious theft are known, they are not at present, nor
are they likely to be, in custody.” -
For some considerable period Mr. Punch has been exposed to a series
of petty pilferings of small but very valuable articles. It is true he
never missed them, but the public were very frequently subjected
to much annoyance by a system of appropriating an article belonging
to Mr. Punch and trying to convert it into a number of inferior com-
modities. - -
Several little bits of sterling metal belonging to Mr. Punch have
thus been adulterated, beaten out, and mixed with "dross, for the
purpose of working up into a base imitation of some of the most popular
Punch patterns. This plan, however, was very easy of detection, and
the unprincipled purloiners got very little by their nefarious practices,
which had the disadvantage also of entailing upon them a tremendous
amount of hard labour.
Mr. Punch has long submitted to those petty depredations, for it
|need scarcely be said that being exceedingly rich it was impossible for
him to miss a few miscellaneous articles. Encouraged no doubt by
- |ºir impunity, a set of needy fellows conspired before the present
* - Christmas to commit a bold and wholesale burglary on Mr. Punch's
premises. There can be no doubt of the guilt of the culprits, for the
goods have since been found introduced into all the pantomimes in
| London, the managers of the theatres having turned their establish-
ments into houses for the reception of stolen goods on this occasion.
It appears that Mr. Punch's portfolio has been ransacked in the most
audacious manner. The Trafalgar Fountains, which he had pitched
away into his back row, as nothing better than so much old lead, have
been carried off by these depredators, and his choice and valuable articles
connected with the WELLINGTON Statue may all be seen on the stage of
every theatre where any pantomime is being represented in the
metropolis.
|
It is earnestly recommended to any of the public who may be de-
sirous to learn full particulars of this daring burglary, to obtain a
search warrant, which can be done by paying for it at the door of any
| London theatre, when they will have an opportunity of seeing the
awſul extent to which this most daring burglary has been carried.
Mr. Punch will not give himself the trouble to prosecute these light-
fingered, though heavy-penned gentry, but it is right that they should
be subjected to this public exposure.
The last months of his life seem to have been spent in a remarkably
cheerful sort of royal retirement. DE CoMINEs informs us, that “to look
upon him, one would have thought him rather a dead than a living man.

WHO IS LORD MAYOR 2
This question is agitating the heart of the City. Aldermen
ask of one another, in a mysterious voice, “Have you seen the
LoRD MAYOR 2'' and the answer invariably is, “No ; not since the
ninth of November 1” The old saying of “Enough is as good as
a feast” does not apply, it seems, to civic entertainments ; and
the whole of the Common Council and attachés of the City throne
are panic-stricken lest the LoRD MAyor should have broken up
his batterie de cuisine, under the delusion that “one dinner makes
a mayoralty.” The Corporation is bursting with indignation at
the sinful neglect of their elected monarch, and intends to convey
to him pretty plainly that the civic throne has “its duties as well
as its rights,” and that hospitality is not only one of the latter,
but also one of the former. We cannot tell where this agitation
will end , but in the meantime, as not a person has seen him
since the day of his coronation, the question is still running about
the City, “Who is LoRD MAYor?” BIRch, of Cornhill, we hope,
will soon pour turtle upon these troubled waters.
SHAMEFUL WASTE.
Consid:RING the burdens under which both France and Eng-
land at this moment labour, we loudly invoke the public indig-
nation against the reckless extravagance of Lord PALMERston
and M. GUIzot. It is impossible to glance at their voluminous
correspondence respecting the Spanish marriages, without being
horrified by the shocking waste of paper, pens, and ink, which it
must, have involved. We should like to know how many quires,
bundles, and bottles of writing materials it has cost; ail, as the
event has proved, utterly thrown away. The foolscap thus ini-
quitously squandered by these Ministers, may well be said to rest
on their own heads.
“THE BEST OF HUSBANDs.”
HIS is a very rare animal ; but
he is to be found. The exist.
ence of the unicorn has been
successfully disputed; and that
very handsome and graceful
animal, instead of being har-
nessed to HER MAJESTY's state-
carriage—as assuredly the spe-
cies should be, could eight of
them be procured—is merely
employed upon heraldic duty,
namely, to support HER MA-
JESTY's Arms. But the good
husband—let all our virgin
readers take heart—is not fa-
bulous. We cannot, certainly,
precisely mark out his habitat.
We do not think the creature
is to be found at public mas-
querades, or billiard-rooms, or
in soiled boots, dancing the
Polka at the Casino de Venus,
de Bacchus, or any other casino
of any other disreputable
heathen deity. The habits, too,
of the Best of Husbands vary
with the best of wives. Some
are best for one particular
virtue—some, for another—and some for virtues too numerous to
specify. Some Best of Husbands are always buying best of wives
new gowns; some best, again, are continually taking their bet-
ter-best to the opera or play; in fact, in ten thousand different
modes do the Best of Husbands show their superiority to the
second best, and the middling, and the fine ordinary, and those
merely good for families. But MR. B.Rown, the best husband of
the best MRs. BRowN, did—according to that excellent—in the
most devoted manner display the paramount excellence of his
marital qualities. MRs. BRowN herself, only on Thursday last,
informed her dear friend MRs. SMITH of the peculiarity that blest
her with the best of men. MRs. SMITH had dropt in to talk of
nothing, and have a dish of tea. MRs. SMITH had left her bon-
net, muff, and cloak, in MRs. BRown's bedroom, and was seated
at MRs. BRowN's fire. MRs. SMITH put her hands to her head,
and softly sighed.
Mrs. Brown. What's the matter, my dear 7 You don't look well. Nothing
particular, I hope P
Mrs. Smith. Oh no, nothing. Only SMITH again, as usual.
Mrs. Brown. Poor thing ! Well, I do pity you. What is it 2
Mrs. Smith. Oh, my love, that Club. He wasn't home till two this
morning, and I sitting up, and—yes, but you are a happy woman.—I’ve
no doubt, now, that MR. Brown—
Mrs. Brown. Bless you, my dear! He was reading the paper to me all
the evening.
Mrs. Smith. Ha! MR. BRowN is a good man.
Mrs. Brown. A good man, my dear? If I were to tell you all, you would
say_so. In fact, he's the best of husbands, and one little thing will prove it.
Mrs. Smith. What's that, MRs. BRowN ?
Mrs. Brown. Why this, MRs. SMITH. You wouldn't once think it of the
dear, kind soul; but he's so fond of me, that all this bitter cold weather,
he always goes up first to bed, to—warm my place | Now, I call that—

3}uitti)'s jolitical Dictionarp.
OverseeR. This word is a misnomer, for it applies to the officer whose
duty it is in parochial matters to oversee or overlook nothing. He is to
have an eye to arrears of rates, and look up putative fathers who have
neglected their small liabilities.
PARISH CLERK. A person whose duty it is to assist the parson, but who
very frequently puts him out by exclaiming Amen at the wrong time, and
by other improprieties. The Parish Clerk is also useful in looking after the
fees for himself and his principal. In small parishes the Parish Clerk and
Sexton are one ; but in case of marriages and christenings, when gratuities
are expected, he contrives by a little re-arrangement of his hair, or perhaps
a rapid change of coat, to keep the characters separate.
PARK. A privileged inclosure for beasts of the forest and chase. The
only remnant of such an inclosure is Whetstone Park, where the chase was
kept up till a late period by some stricken deer of a debtor running down it
to escape the pursuit of those inveterate huntsmen, the sheriff's officers.
Since the abolition of imprisonment for debt, the park of Whetstone has
become a kind of resort for wild animals, many of whom may be seen peer-
ing from their respective roosts in that locality.

PIRATICAL EXPEDITIONS.
WE understand, that, since
the flooring of the Flores
affair, several contem-
plated piratical expedi-
tions have been disco-
vered. One of them was
a plan of invasion, to be
carried into execution
with regard to the Isle of
Dogs, which was described
in a placard as “a fertile
district overflowing with
all the bounties of Na-
ture;” though the occa-
sional overflowing of the
Thames is the only natural
bounty of which it gets the benefit. A well-known captain in the
Thames steamboat service was to have been the leader in this scheme,
and every volunteer had been promised a native dog, worth a pound,
on his arrival at the island.
Another scheme, of more pretension still, was a contemplated
descent on the Eel Pies. A scheme had been laid by which all the
natives would have been spitch cooked at a given signal, and the leader
of the project would have been invested at once with the dictatorship:
The whole of his followers would have received an eel-pie, “free and
for ever,” on setting their feet on shore; and it was intended that the
ee's should have been treated a la Tartare by these ignoble imitators of
the pirates of Tartary. The whole plan was discovered by a rumºur
having gone abroad that there were some snakes in the grass, which
caused the chief to relinquish the enterprise. On further inquiry, it
turned out that the “snakes in the grass” were nothing but some poor
harmless eels, who had escaped from the cook, and were rolling about on
the turf, with a delicious consciousness of freedom.
THE SNOBS CF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XLVII.-CLUB SNOBS.
Both sorts of young men, mentioned in my last under the flippant
names of Wiggle and WAGGLE, may be found in tolerable plenty, I
think, in Clubs. WIGGLE and WAGGLE are both idle. They come of
the middle classes. One of them very likely makes believe to be a
barrister, and the other has smart apartments about Piccadilly. They
are a sort of second-chop dandies; they cannot imitate that superb
listlessness of demeanour, and that admirable vacuous folly which
distinguishes the noble and high-born chiefs of the race; but they
lead lives almost as bad (were it but for the example), and are per-
sonally quite as useless. I am not going to arm a thunderbolt, and
launch it at the heads of these little Pall Mall butterflies. They don't
commit much public harm, or private extravagance. They don't spend
a thousand pounds for diamond ear-rings for an Opera-dancer, as LoRD
TARQUIN can : neither of them ever set up a public-house or broke
the bank of a gambling-club, like the young EARL of MARTINGALE.
They have good points, kind feelings, and deal honourably in money-
transactions—only in their characters of men of second-rate pleasure
about town, they and their like are so utterly mean, self-contented,
and absurd, that they must not be omitted in a work treating on
Snobs.
Wiggle has been abroad, where he gives you to understand that
his success among the German countesses and Italian princesses,
whom he met at the tables d'hôte, was perfectly terrific. His rooms are
hung round with pictures of actresses and ballet-dancers. He passes
his mornings in a fine dressing-gown, burning pastilles, and reading
Don Juan and French novels (by the way, the life of the author of
Don Juan, as described by himself, was the model of the life of a Snob).
He has twopenny-halfpenny French prints of women with languishing
eyes, dressed in dominoes, guitars, gondolas, and so forth, and tells
you stories about them.
“It’s a bad print,” says he, “I know, but I've a reason for liking it.
It reminds me of somebody, somebody I knew in other climes. You
have heard of the PRINCI Essa DI Monte PULCIA No 2 I met her at
Rimini. Dear, dear FRANCEscAl That fair-haired, bright-eyed thing
in the Bird of Paradise and the Turkish Simar with the love-bird on
her finger, I'm sure must have been taken from—from somebody
perhaps whom you don't know—but she's known at Munich, WAGGLE,
my boy, everybody knows the CountEss OTTILIA D1 EULENscHRECK-
ENSTEIN. Gad, sir, what a beautiful creature she was when I danced
with her on the birthday of PRINCE ATTILA of Bavaria, in '441
PRINCE CARLoMAN was our ris-à-ris, and PRINCE PEPIN danced the
same contre danse. She had a polyanthus in her bouquet. WAGGLE, I
hare it now.” His countenance assumes an agonised and mysterious
expression, and he buries his head in the sofa cushions, as if plunging
into a whirlpool of passionate recollections.
Last year he made a considerable sensation, by having on his table
a morocco miniature-case locked by a gold key, which he always
wore round his neck, and on which was stamped a serpent—emblem of
eternity—with the letter M in the circle. Sometimes he laid this upon
his little morocco writing-table, as if it were on an altar—generally
he had flowers upon it—in the middle of a conversation he would
start up and kiss it. He would call out from his bed-room to his
valet, “Hicks, bring me my casket !”
“I don't know who it is,” WAGGLE would say. “Who does know
that fellow's intrigues 1 DesBorough WIGGLE, sir, is the slave of
passion. I suppose you have heard the story of the Italian princess
locked up in the Convent of Saint Barbara, at Rimini—he hasn't told
you ? then I'm not at liberty to speak—or the Countess, about whom
he nearly had the duel with PRINCE WITIKIND of Bavaria º Perhaps
you hav'n't even heard about that beautiful girl at Pentonville,
daughter of a most respectable dissenting clergyman. She broke her
heart when she found he was engaged (to a most lovely creature of
high family, who afterwards proved false to him) and she's now in
Hanwell.”
WAGGLE's belief in his friend amounts to frantic adoration.
“What a genius he is, if he would but apply himself?" he whispers to
me. “He could be anything, sir, but for his passions. His poems
are the most beautiful things you ever saw. He's written a con-
tinuation of Don Juan, from his own adventures. Did you ever read
his lines to MARY : They’re superior to BYRoN, sir—superior to
BYRON.” -
I was glad to hear this from so accomplished a critic as WAGGLE ;
for the fact is, I had composed the verses myself for honest Wiggle
one day, whom I found at his chambers plunged in thought over a
very dirty old-fashioned album, in which he had not as yet written a
single word.
“I can't,” says he. “Some days I can write whole cantos, and to-
day not a line. O, SNoB such an opportunity Such a divine
creature She's asked me to write verses for her album, and I
can't.”
“Is she rich P’’ said I.
but an heiress.”
“O, SNoB 1 she's the most accomplished, highly-connected creature I
—and I can't get out a line.”
“How will you have it,” says I : “hot with sugar * *
“Don’t, don't You trample on the most sacred feelings, SNoB.
I want something wild and tender-like BYRON. I want to tell her
that amongst the festive halls, and that sort of thing, you know,-I
only think about her, you know—that I scorn the world, and am weary
of it, you know, and—something about a gazelle, and a bulbul, you
“I thought you would never marry any
know.”
“And a yataghan to finish off with,” the present writer observed,
and we began :-
TO MARY.
I seem, in the midst of the crowd,
The lightest of all ;
My laughter rings cheery and loud,
In banquet and ball.
My lip hath its smiles and its sneers,
For all men to see ;
But my soul, and my truth, and my tears,
Are for thee, are for thee I
“Do you call that neat, W1GGLE 7" says I. “I declare it almost
makes me cry, myself.”
“Now suppose,” says Wiggle, “we say that all the world is at my
feet—make her jealous, you know, and that sort of thing—and that
—that I’m going to trarel, you know. That perhaps may work upon

So We (as this wretched prig said) began again—"
Around me they flatter and fawn—
The young and the old,
The fairest are ready to pawn
Their hearts for my gold.

“You abominable young impostor,” I exclaimed. “Finish the poem for yourself!” And
so he did, and entirely out of all metre, and bragged about the work at the Club as his
own performance.
Poor WAggle fully believed in his friend's genius, until one day last week he came
with a grin on his countenance to the Club and said, “O, SNoB, I've made such a discovery :
Going down to the skating to-day, whom should I see but Wiggle walking with that
splendid woman—that lady of illustrious family and immense fortune–MARY, you know,

—and W1GGLE's going to marry her next week.”

“So much the better, WAGGLE, my young friend,” I exclaimed. “Better for the sake
of womankind that this dangerous dog should leave off lady-killing—this Blue-Beard give
up practice. Or, better rather for his own sake. For as there is not a word of truth in
any of those prodigious love-stories which you used to swallow : nobody has been hurt
except Wiggle himself, whose affections will now centre in the ham-and-beef shop.
There are people, MR. WAGGLE, who do these things in earnest, and hold a good rank in
the world too. But these are not subjects for ridicule, and though certainly Snobs, are
scoundrels likewise. Their cases go up to a higher Court.”
The Root of an Evil.
IT certainly is true that “ill weeds thrive apace,” for Leicester Square, which has been
prosecuting for several years this branch of horticulture, has at present the finest collection
that “was ever seed.” This luxuriance of ill weeds may probably account for the very bad
cigars that are sold in the neighbourhood. |
(The 3300k of 3}romigrg.
THE KING OF DENMARK promises to give his
subjects a liberal Constitution. We think a
collection of royal and political promises would
make a most curious book. It would be amusing
to calculate how many out of the number had
been fulfilled. We will make a catalogue of
these fragile articles, and the reader must reckon
for himself those which, during their long travels,
have reached their journey's end without being
broken :—
1. The memorable and never-to-be-forgotten
promise of the KING of PRussia to give his sub-
jects a liberal Constitution. The date of this
promise is lost in the clouds of German tobacco-
smoke.
2. The promise of Russia, Prussia, and Austria
to keep inviolate the Republic of Cracow.
3. The promise of Louis-Philippe that the
forts round Paris should not be armed with can.
non excepting in cases of emergency.
4. The prºmise of the same promising monarch
that “La Charte" should be something like
“ºne vérité"; to say nothing of several pro-
mises made at Eu—and hence called IOU’s—
too numerous to mention.
5. The promise of a certain Prime Minister of
England, that the Income Tax, when he put it
upon the back of John BULL, was only to be a
burden for three years.
6. The thousand-and-one promises that the
Duke of York's debts should be paid.
7. The promise of an Uncrowned Monarch of
Ireland, that unless repeal was carried in a
twelvemonth he would, with the greatest plea-
sure, put his head upon the block, and die for
the good of his country.
8. The innumerable promises of the Protec-
tionists, that England was to be ruined a twelve-
month after the repeal of the Corn Laws.
9. The incalculable promises made about the
completion of the Nelson Column, and the new
Houses of Parliament.
. Perhaps “Promise” is too slight a word for
many of the above subjects; but we make allow-
ances, for we know that a king is not particular
to an oath. May the subjects of Denmark fare
a little better than those of the countries who
have been fed with similar promises :
ARRANGEMENTS FOR PARLIAMENT.
It is generally understood that some arrange-
ments will be shortly made to provide better
accommodation for the numerous parties who
resort to the House of Commons. The difficulty
of finding a sufficiency of front seats for the
Opposition has been already the cause of the
greatest inconvenience. We believe we may
announce with confidence, that the Opposition
benches will be divided into stalls and numbered,
so that the annoyance of overcrowding may be
obviated as much as possible. There is no
doubt that the numbering plan will be so far
objectionable, that there can be only a single
“number one,” and the contest for that is
always terrific in the House of Commons. We
believe that the numbers will not go beyond ten
or a dozen, but that a quantity of tickets will be
issued, having the cipher 0 upon them, for
indiscriminate distribution among the general
mass of individuals of whom the 0 is considered
to be the most appropriate representative.
OATHS IN PRUssIA.—Prussia has substituted a
brief oath in her courts for the long formula
hitherto in use. The reason for this is obvious .
Prussia, with a keen recollection of Cracow,
wishes to make as little of an oath as possible.

THE BEADLES OF ENGLAND.
SoME ingenious details have lately been given in the news-
papers of the domestic position of the various sovereigns of
Europe ; with reference to their ages, their being single or
married, their number of children, and other facts of equal
interest. Through the kindness of a statistical friend, we are
enabled to lay before the public some particulars relating to
that very remarkable class, the British Beadlery. It seems
that ninety Beadles have reached the age of sixty, forty-five
Beadles have been married twice, seven Beadles have had
ninety-one children, and eight Beadles are bachelors. Four
hundred and sixty-three Beadles wear gold lace on their
hats, and one Beadle puts his cocked hat in the window
of his residence as an ornament. Eleven Beadles cane the
first boy they meet, and sixteen Beadles run out of church
during service to see that the public-houses in the parish are
shut, and sit down in the bar, to take care that they continue
so, till, at least, within five minutes of the service being over.
A hundred and nineteen Beadles are invariably intoxicated
the day after Christmas Day, and two are sometimes sober.
Of the London Arcade Beadles, five are misanthropists, and
one—the Beadle of the Exéter Arcade—is a cynic. Of the
Quadrant Beadles, one is a day-dreamer, and the other a waiter
at evening parties.
Such are a few facts on the British Beadlery, which we
hope the British public will be able to appreciate.
A PROFOUND POLITICAL TRUTH.
“A NATION,” says the Morning Post, “cannot prosper with
all its energies crushed, with all its exertions paralysed.”
There is a wondrous truth in this ; a truth almost as new and
beautiful as that enunciated in the Critic :—
“For when the heart is sunk in deep despair,
It cannot taste of merriment.”
THE COALHEAVER'S COMPLAINT.

Political Comparison.
“SIR,” said DR. Johnson to Boswell, “comparisons are odious.
Sir, the Whigs make comparisons.” What Johnson meant by the
latter assertion, we do not know ; but certain it is that the Whigs are
now making a comparison which, whether odious or not, is certainly
just. They say that the Conservatives are like the Westminster
constituency—because both may whistle for a-LEADER.
THE TREATMENT OF A DOG.
Poland is henceforth to be called New Russia. Nicholas treats
Poland like a dog, and being determined to destroy it, begins with
giving it a bad name.
A PEC KHAM ALI.EGORY.
THE newspapers tell us that “a wolf was shot at Peckham : Near
its place of refuge a number of cats' skins were found, as if it had fed
on the tabbies of the neighbourhood.” We understand that this seem-
ingly alarming paragraph merely alludes to the capture of a gentleman
by bailiffs, a muffin-destroying gentleman, who, for some time past,
has been a great favourite at the tea-table of various elderly spinsters
of the locality. The penny-a-liners have ascended to allegory.
PontRAIT of The PEckham Wour.
DONNA MARIA's TEA PARTIES.
THE Morning Post has an especial correspondent to report these

announced —“[From our own Spoon.]”

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL TOM THUMB.
THE GENERAL GIVES AUDIENCE TO LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN
—FREEDOM OF THE CITY-THE GENERAL'S MUTTON CHOP.
GEN'RAL,” ses BARNUM, drawin in his head from the
winder, and his face all alight and red, like the
percession come to take you down to the 'Gyptian
Hall. There's the LoRD MAYoR in his goold coach,
and the sheriffs, and men in brass and steel armour,
and the aldermen, and a band o' trumpets and kittle-
drums, and crowds of women in rainbow silks and
sattins, and I think—but I’ll not be sure—a leetle
sprinklin of bishops, and all, as I say, to tend you in
state to the Hall. I must say it, Gen'ral ; it's
very handsome of the critters.”
“Is our Ambassador—is EveRETT among 'em,”
ses I; for I own it—I did feel a leetle streaked that
my own representative at the British Court should
hang back at the eend. "Twasn't doin the right
thing afore strangers.”
“Gen'ral,” ses BARNUM, “tainte to be expected.
The fact is—oh there’s no doubt on it—that Eve-
RETT is a leetle ryled at your tarnation success afore
Gracious Majesty. Then, agin, EveRETT is a literary critter—”
“What's a literary critter,” ses I, for I’d never heerd of it by
that name.
| “Oh, a critter”—ses BARNUM, smilin sour, with his mouth like a
vinegar cruet—“a critter that wriggles in ink, upon foolscap.”
“I see 1 Making marks like a snail upon a cabbage leaf,” ses I.
“Jist so,” ses BARNUM. “And such critters are special catawam-
pious at the rael thing—the true grit, like you. You know, Gen'ral,
you saw a lot of 'em at the Palace with Gracious Majesty, eatin
muffins with the Prince, and helping themselves to cream and sugar,
as if they’d been born with royal tongs twixt their fingers. Well,
you're the nat'ral true thing—a fortin in your own littleness; and
they can't abide that you should have come into the world, like a
human dimond as you are—the brightest gem in the crown of America,
if she had one. It's all summed up in this, I tell you. They can't
abide that anybody's littleness should make a fortin, when what they
call their greatness can hardly make both eends meet.”
“I think it's only belittleing ourselves to talk of the critters,” ses I.
“How'sumever, I'm not goin to the Hall, afore I’ve had somethin to
eat. And I do think, BARNUM, 'twould be only acting like the freest
citizens of the airth if we axed the Mayor and Aldermen to take a
julep, and sent some bread and cheese to the men in brass and steel
outside.”
“You’re right, Gen'ral,” ses BARNUM. “Our country can't expect
no less on us.” Whereupon BARNUM was goin down stairs, when he
stopt. “What will you take, Gen'ral 2"
“Oh, a mutton chop—done in paper, what d'ye call it 7” ses I,
for I'd seen the sort two days afore.
“A cutlet a lar Maintenon,” ses BARNUM. “And do you know—for
its my dooty, as your guardian, while you fill my pocket, to fill your
Lunnun sun in a fog, “Gen'ral,” ses he, “here's a
off a piece of vellum or ass's skin, tainte for me to say which. “Gen-
'ral”—ses LoRD MAYor—“it is the old and ancient custom of the
LoRD MAYor of the fust commercial city of the airth”—
“New York excepted,” ses I.
“New York excepted,” ses he, coloring a leetle about the nose, “to
welcome genius of any sort, and of any size, to the sile of England.
|The city of London is the appinted seat of all the Arts.”
|, “I’m very glad to hear it,” ses I, “and hope they have all taken
their places.”
Whereupon Lord Mayor coughs, and goes on. “London, proud of
her merchant princes—crowned as they are with bank paper—London,
proud of Temple Bar, and ALDERMAN GIBBs, and Bow bell, and her
giants—London is still more proud of the genius she has fostered.
Look at SHAKspeARE : it isn't for me to say how many hundred
pounds London has given for his signitur or oughtograff (though London
won't let his plays be acted, for fear of corruptin her prentices)–
London, through me, offers you the freedom of the city.”
“Much obleeged,” ses I, “What's it good for 7"
“'Twill permit you, Gen'ral,” ses Lord Mayor, “to open a shop in
the City, or to work as a coal-porter. And whereas, Gen'ral, at the
door of our noble cathedral, St. Paul's—that beautiful edifice, that
we're so fond on that we’ve smothered it round about with houses,
just like killin a critter with kindness—wherein no free and inlightened
citizen can enter that sacred buildin before he puts down tuppence,
the City of London offers you, through me, a free admission for the
season.”
“For one,” ses I.
“For two,” ses Lord Mayor, “yourself and BARNUM. And now it
is for you, Gen'ral, to appint the day when you will receive the free-
dom; and pray obleege us with a long notice, that Guildhall may be
'scrubbed and whitewashed, and the giants gilt and painted for the
'casion.”
“LoRD MAYor,” ses I, without ever getting up, “I shall be happy
to take the freedom—any freedom, in fact—with this leetle bargain,
| that you allow me also to appinte the size, and weight, and make of
the goold box that is to hold it.” Whereupon Lord MAYoº and
|Aldermen puckered up their mouths and nodded their heads, kinder
to say, “you've fixed our flints, anyhow.”
Well, the mint julep and the cobblers went round, and mighty
pleasant it was. “Gen'ral,” ses LoRD MAYor, his nose getting like
any babby's coral ; “Gen'ral I’ll give you a toast. Here is to the
intimate relations atween England and America; and may GENERAL
ToM THUMB prove a link—a goolden link—to the two countries.”
“LoRD MAYor and Aldermen,” ses I, “as the freest citizen in airth,
I thank you. Doubtless you mean well, poor critters 1 by the toast
aforesaid. But if I am to be the link atween the two countries, don’t
you think it will a leetle bit hurt the shippin interest, seein how
tarnation short it will make the passage 2"
You never heerd sich larfin as there was at this. And BARNUM
larfed—and I could see it—wos as proud of me as a monkey of a new
jacket. And then in his sly, soft, and buttery manner he ses, “Don’t,
Gen'ral, don't ; ” all the while meanin “Do, Gen'ral, do.”
Well, still they handed round the cobblers and sandwiches, and
still Lord MAYor and Aldermen ate and drank, and still the British
public—inlightened critters l—waited, with their toes a coolin on the
|stones outside—and the ladies, pretty, pussy things with their noses
gettin as blue as vi'lets, in the carriages. At last, LoRD MAYoF ses

THE RISING OF THE THAMES.
IT has been ascertained that the Thames
has been rising for some years.
There is now every prospect that it
will soon roll leisurely into the Houses
of Parliament and inundate the floor,
which has hitherto been immersed in
nothing less dry than a flood of ero-
quence. We are not quite sure what it

from their elevation, keep the occu-

For those members who are accus-

The Price of Genius.
WE are happy to find that notwithstanding the alleged extinction of
the drama, the price of dramatic genius has suffered no abatement.
According to the latest state of the market, a hundred pounds a night
have been asked, and fifty pounds a night have been refused by a fair
ex-actress.
“GLUT OF WILD Fowl.”—Under this title we find an article in
the papers announcing insane ducks at sixpence a piece, hares at a
shilling a head, and wild rabbits as a complete drug in the market.
We could understand flesh being made of one, and fowl of the other,
but how they manage to make fowl of both is beyond our comprehension.
THE DEGENERATE PARLIAMENT,
OR, THE LAMENT OF BOODLE'S.
TO BE SUNG BY SOME OLD POLITICAL GENTLEMAN.
AIR-‘‘Lillabullero.”
AH ! Parliament now is no longer the thing
It was in the days when we powder'd our locks,—
The time when we had GEORGE THE THIRD for our king,
For statesmen with SHERIDAN, BURRE, PITT, and Fox.
Totally changed,
Quite disarranged,
'Tis all a confusion and myst'ry to me;
In vain I perpend it,
I can't comprehend it,
But Parliament's not what it once used to be.
'Twas never required, when I enter'd on life,
That Members should work any more than they chose;
A few carried on the political strife,
The rest very quietly left it to those.
Nobody spoke,
Save for a joke,
Excepting some eminent men, two or three ;
The others less noted,
All silently voted :
Ah! Parliament's not what it once used to be.
Your old County Member would join in debate,
Or not, as it happen'd to suit his desire,
He sat in the House as a person of weight,
Content to be honour'd as Knight of his Shire.
That way or this—
Right or amiss—
He voted, unpledged, independent, and free
Of Premier's dominion,
Or Public Opinion—
Ah Parliament’s not what it once used to be.
Your Members for Boroughs had nothing to do
But vote for their interest and stick by their side;
And so all the Government work was got through
By means of supporters on whom they relied .
Trouble was saved,
Argument waiv'd,
The fate of a measure 'twas easy to see ;
This cut short debating,
Protesting and prating—
Ah 1 Parliament's not what it once used to be.
On Raflway Committees, in those happy times,
By force and compulsion no gentleman served ;
There ne'er were discussions on punishing crimes
When rogues were all hang'd, as, of course, they deserved.
People, when ruled,
Need not be school’d.
There then was no talking—all fiddle-de-dee—
About Education,
And teaching the nation—
Ah 1 Parliament's not what it once used to be.
The speeches, moreover, are not what they were,
The language, the action, are not half so fine ;
Egad, Sir, 'twas grand, 'twas sublime, I declare,
To listen to SHERIDAN, after his wine.
DUNDAs to PITT,
Tipsy a bit,
Observed, in his place, “I no Speaker can see; ”
And Pitt said, “Can't you, Sir 2
Why, I can see two, Sir 1"–
Ah Parliament's not what it once used to be.
The Whigs and the Tories, in those times alone,
Between them divided the House and the State ;
But good old distinctions are nearly o'erthrown,
And there's a new party in modern debate.
Seeking forsooth
Justice and truth,
On no other principles pledged to agree ;
Who take no positions
Among politicians :—
Ah Parliament's not what it once used to be.

PUNCH, OR
THE
LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HEADLESS OPPOSITION.
SHORTLY before the opening of Parliament, the peers and members
who this session constitute the Opposition, met, we understand, for the
purpose of choosing a leader in the Lords and Commons. The
following is a summary of the proceedings which, as we are informed,
took place at this Meeting :-
The Chair was taken by Lord STANLEY. His lordship said that
the purpose for which they were assembled was to determine on the
choice of leaders. He had no objection himself to lead the Opposition
in the Lords ; but the question was, whom was he to oppose ? He
had formerly acted with the Whigs, and subsequently with the
Conservatives ; but he now hardly knew with whom to act, or indeed,
how to act at all. He was decidedly a Protectionist, but now he did
not see what there was to protect. He would do what he could
against Ministers, but should like to know what he could do. Perhaps
he could fight them on Irish ground. Gentlemen were now in
possession of his sentiments, and he would not detain them any
longer.
The DURE OF RICHMOND was the Farmer's Friend, and so far, an
enemy to the Government, but he did not see, at present, in what way
he could befriend the farmer. He was hardly prepared to say that he
could oppose the Ministry on all points, and though he should feel it an
honour, he feared he should find it a difficulty, to lead the Opposition.
The DUKE of BuckINGHAM would willingly be the head of his party,
if, in that case, his party would be satisfied that it had head enough.
LoRD BRough AM was surprised at the difficulty experienced in
undertaking the leadership of the Opposition. Opposition was the
easiest thing in the world. He would not be backward in coming
forward. He would oppose anything or anybody.
LoRP GeoRGE BENTINCR would be too happy to assume the reins of
leadership in the House of Commons. He was well up to the work
of a leader—and a wheeler too, for the matter of that. He would back
himself ten to one against the field—he meant the House—to drive the
Qpposition. And he would say for his noble friend LoRD STANLEY,
that there was no man fitter than the noble lord for the same post in
the Lords... He (Lord GEORGE) always had an eye to the Derby.
For himself he would only say, that if they wanted a stable mind, he
was their man. His Lordship concluded these observations with
some spirited, but inarticulate accents, similar to those usually ad-
dressed to horses.
MR. B., Dish AELI would lead the Opposition with pleasure. He
would undertake to discharge a philippic on every opportunity against
the Ministry, which he apprehended was all that would be necessary.
He would pick as many holes in Lord John Russell's coat as he had
in PEEL's, and would reduce it to such a state that if the noble lord
should once more go and bathe, the right honourable baronet should
find the garment not worth stealing.
SIR Robert PEEL would treat the remarks of the last speaker as
they deserved. . For his own part, he had no relish for Opposition.
Still he would be happy to serve his friends in any reasonable way.
And, he would tell them this, though perhaps he told it them who
should not tell it them—
“Another of his fathom they have not
To lead their business.”
This remark, though received with murmurs, passed unanswered,

QThe Queen's $peerſ).
Though we shall be at press at the moment when the Royal Speech
is in the course of delivery, we have so arranged our extraordinary
express in anticipation of everything, but particularly in anticipation
of what HER MAJESTY is likely to say, that we are enabled to give the
following particulars. We do not mean to say that the Speech we
subjoin will be the same as that delivered by the QUEEN, but when the
difference of price is considered, we think it will be allowed that ours is
really the superior article. We do not give the royal address—as it
ought to have been—verbatim, but we furnish the substance in the
following paragraphs :—
HER MAJESTY will commence by saying she is glad to meet her
Lords and faithful Commons; but she will put a stress on the adjective,
as if she were saying to herself, in allusion to recent tergiversations,
“Faithful Commons ! Faithful fiddlestick.”
HER MAJESTY will next proceed to announce that she is still on good
terms with foreign relations ; but she will hint at some little disa-
greeables, which are generally the consequence of relations becoming
too intimate.
She will then allude to the state of Ireland, and will intimate that
her Ministers have measures to propose, but what those measures are,
she will leave to them to explain at the proper period.
HER MAJESTY will perhaps suggest that certain social improvements
will be proposed by her Government; but all this part of the Speech
will be vague, and indeed everything will be as mysterious as usual,
until the QUEEN graciously comes to the paragraph in which it is in-
timated to her faithful Commons that large supplies will be required,
and that she hopes they will be liberally granted.
We will just insinuate that a clause had been prepared, recommending
the placing of Mr. Punch on the Civil List, with a seat—a tolerably easy
one—in the Cabinet ; but as there was some disagreement on the point,
the proposal was withdrawn for the present.
Though the Speech as delivered may not coincide exactly with the
above outline, it will be found to correspond in all the most essential
particulars.
THE LAY OF A PENNY-A-LINER.
A NEwsPAPER paragraph states that two eggs were found in the
ruins of Halicarnassus, which were at least 2000 years old. We have
been favoured by a provincial correspondent with some wonderful par-
ticulars concerning these veteran eggs. A gentleman, a zealous anti-
quarian, who was most anxious to cultivate the taste of eggs 2000 years
old, had them boiled for his breakfast. What was his astonishment on
cracking them to find that one of them contained a young alligator, and
that the other disclosed a fine specimen of that extinct bird, the phoenix,
or the ibis, the gentleman is uncertain which
By the bye it seems rather odd to us that the age of these antiquated
eggs is so accurately known ; but we suppose a certificate of the year
in which they were laid, signed by two respectable old birds of the
period, was found with them,-or was the day of their ovation marked
upon them, as fresh-laid eggs are chalked in the country by careful
housewives, to prevent their lasting till the crack of doom ? We hope
when another egg is found at all approaching to the age of the inte-
resting couple, whose premature dissolution we have just chronicled, that
a committee of science will be appointed to sit upon it.
Classical Constabless
CAMBRIDGE, owing to the proctorial controversy, is nightly, according
to the Cambridge Advertiser, the scene of uproar and tumult. We con-
gratulate the collegiate police on their increasing sphere of usefulness.
We hope these gentlemen do not forget the classic in the constable.
We trust they say “Perge” for “Move on,” and we recommend them,
as often as may be necessary, as it appears to be every evening, to
have the Riot Act read in Latin.
A SPANISH Lesson.
BuckINGHAM PALACE has refused, this year, the New Year's Gift
sent annually by the Tuileries. Victor LA, taught experience by the
past, naturally mistrusts the present.

ROYAL SPORT.
IT is stated in the papers that game is
being preserved in the gardens of
Buckingham Palace. Our first im-
pression was, that game is being
potted on the premises; but on read-
ing further we found that pheasants,
hares, and partridges, are being bred
in the grounds attached to the royal
residence. We may expect to hear
soon of a pack of Pimlico hounds ;
- and the Belgrave hunt will, no doubt,
AZT , , become one of the fashionable “meets”
|-- ºs- of the season. Littlesºwill
º- = grow into a miniature Melton Mow-
= bray, and the Tothill Street harriers
_ will soon obtain a place in sporting
= annals. Pheasant shooting will com-
mence in Grosvenor place at the usual
time, and by next September we hope
to start a covey of partridges in
Piccadilly. It is probable that the
grouse, if any should be preserved, will take advantage of the bird:
cages in Bird-cage Walk for “safety and for succour.” We shall
certainly take out a license to enable us to shoot our way along the
Strand ; though we believe our sportsmanship, which confines itself to
shooting folly as it flies, requires no certificate.
“THE STANDARD.”
Of the family name of the late Count GoNFALONIERE, the victim of
Austrian oppression, this historical notice may be found, in that
pleasant book entitled Camden's Remaynes. Mrs. Harris will, doubtless
read it with great delectation :-
“Patronimia, or names of familye and descent, were, in yº originall,
given to denote some remarkable qualitye of minde or bodye wherein yº
founder thereof excelled. Thus ye GonFALoNIERI of Venice : as it
were Standard-bearers; a name of honoure, denotinge both valour and
bodily strengthe. Forasmuch as ye Standard is often much exposed
before alle menn, being heavye, requireth alwaye much endurance to support
yº weighte thereof. Soe one indede that can beare yº Standard, muste,
ea vi termini, bee capable of enduringe muche.”
We agree with CAMDEN. He must.
RENEWAL OF THE “ENTENTE CORDIALE.”
Louis-PHILIPPE has, at last, done the handsome thing. Smitten
with remorse for his shabbiness towards our good little Queen, whom
he so cruelly deceived in his snug, little parlour at Eu, about the
Spanish match, His Majesty has resolved, at any moderate sacrifice, to
renew the entente cordiale. QUEEN Poman E is, at the present moment,
the only unwedded queen; and we understand that Louis-PHILIPPE
proposes to use his influence, and if necessary, his forty-two pounders,
to bring about a match between her Sandwich Majesty and a Prince
of the House of Coburg. A very lengthy correspondence—which we
may quote from in our next—has already taken place on the subject.

MR. DYCE’S DESIGNS.
It will be found that MR. Dyce has received a commission to execute
some frescoes for Osborne House. It is to be expected, therefore, that
the German School of Art will be found predominant in the royal marine
residence. We have had an opportunity of seeing some of the designs
which have been fortunate enough to obtain the approbation of HER
MAJESTY.
One represents “BRITANNIA Ruling the Waves," in which the stiff.
ness which a ruler requires is preserved with wondrous fidelity. It is
true, that some hypercritics may object to the angular aspect of the
picture ; but in fishing for effect angles are quite allowable. Our old
...; the British Lion, is beautifully Germanized in the annexed
esign.
The subject of “NEPTUNE resigning the dominion of the seas to
BRITANNIA,” will no doubt lose nothing in MR. Dyce's hands; for the
formal style is well adapted to delineate a legal transaction, which a
i. of dominionship by regular conveyance must always be con-
Sidered.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XLVIII.-CLUB SNOBS.
º
BAcchus is the divinity to whom WAGGLE devotes his especial
worship. “Give me wine, my boy,” says he to his friend WIGGLE,
who is prating about lovely woman; and holds up his glass full of the
rosy fluid and winks at it portentously, and sips it, and smacks his
lips after it, and meditates on it, as if he were the greatest of
connoisseurs.
I have remarked this excessive wine-amateurship especially in
youth. Snoblings from College, Fledglings from the army, Goslings
from the public schools, who ornament our clubs, are frequently to
be heard in great force upon wine-questions. “This bottle's corked,”
says SNoBLING, and MR. SLY, the butler, taking it away, returns pre-
sently with the same wine in another jug, which the young amateur
pronounces excellent. “Hang champagne !” says FLEDGLING, “it’s
only fit for gals and children. Give me pale sherry at dinner, and
my twenty-three claret afterwards.” “What's port now 7" says
Gosling; “disgusting thick sweet stuff—where's the old dry wine one
used to get 2" Until the last twelvemonth, FLEDGLING drank small-
beer at Doctor SwishTAIL's ; and Gosling used to get his dry old
port at a gin-shop in Westminster—till he quitted that seminary,
in 1844.
Anybody who has looked at the caricatures of thirty years ago,
must remember how frequently bottle-noses, pimpled faces, and other
Bardolphian features are introduced by the designer. They are much
more rare now (in nature, and in pictures, therefore) than in those
good old times; but there are still to be found amongst the youth of
our Clubs, lads who glory in drinking-bouts, and whose faces, quite
sickly and yellow, for the most part are decorated with those marks
which Rowland's Kalydor is said to efface. “I was so cut last night
—old boy!” Hopkins says to ToMKINs (with amiable confidence). “I
tell you what we did. We breakfasted with JAck HERRING at twelve,
and kept up with brandy and soda-water and weeds till four ; then
we toddled into the Park for an hour; then we dined and drank
mulled Port till half-price ; then we looked in for an hour at the
Haymarket; then we came back to the Club, and had grills and
whisky punch till all was blue.—Hullo, waiter 1. Get me a glass of
cherry-brandy.” Club waiters, the civillest, the kindest, the patientest
of men, die under the infliction of these cruel young topers. But if
the reader wishes to see a perfect picture on the stage of this class of
young fellows, I would recommend him to witness the ingenious
comedy of London Assurance—the amiable heroes of which are repre-
sented, not only as drunkards and five-o'clock-in-the-morning men,
but as showing a hundred other delightful traits of swindling, lying,
and general debauchery, quite edifying to witness. .
How different is the conduct of these outrageous youths to the
decent behaviour of my friend, MR. PAP worthy; who says to
Poppins, the butler at the Club:-

THE VALUE OF HEALTH AT LIVERPOOL.
Y the papers Mr. Punch learns that the Town Council
of Liverpool intend to appoint an Officer of Health,
whose duties will consist in the direction of their
sanatory arrangements, and whose services they
propose to remunerate by a salary of £300 a year,
with the liberty to augment that handsome income,
if he can, by private practice.
-- Mr. Punch will engage to find a competent person,
24 who will willingly undertake the responsibilities of
; this office, on the liberal terms proposed by the Town
Council of Liverpool.
Mr. Punch, on behalf of the respectable medical
gentleman, his nominee, will promise that he, the said
respectable medical gentleman, shall devote his full attention to his
official duties, and endeavour to make money by private practice only
situation, bringing him in £300, as of primary importance, and shall
look upon his private earnings as matters of secondary consideration.
If the Officer of Health recommended by Mr. Punch shall have for
bourhood; an opulent fellmonger or tallow-chandler, with a yard or
manufactory in the heart of the town, he shall not hesitate from
nuisances. He shall not fail to point out the insalubrity of any gas-
works, similarly situated, the family of whose proprietor, he may
attend ; and if any wealthy old lady who may be in the habit of con-
sulting him shall infringe the Drainage Act, he shall not fail to declare
the circumstance to the authorities.
Mr. Punch repeats, that he will pledge himself to produce an able
and experienced medical practitioner, who shall-fulfil all these con-
ditions; but he respectfully asks the Town Council of Liverpool who,
but himself, would for a moment encourage them to expect such a man
—for their money.
SONG FOR PARLIAMENTARY PARTIES.
IT won't Do, JUST Now, To BE FACTIOUs.
CoME, let us all unite, in the present awkward plight
And most critical position of the nation,
And seriously strive proper measures to contrive,
With a view towards its prompt amelioration.
Small differences we'll blink, animosities we'll sink,
And we'll none of us be crotchetty or fractious ;
For once, at least, must we, somehow manage to agree,
For it won't do, just now, to be factious.
No, really, we must not be factious,
'Twould be rather too bad to be factious,
'Twould be wrong, intimeslike these,'twould indeedbenotthecheese;
It won't do, just now, to be factious.
Chorus. For it won't do, just now, to be factious, &c.
Though ne'er so much inclined one may be to speak one's mind,
To an enemy's annoyance and vexation, -
To waste his country's time recollecting 'tis a crime, .
Let him carefully suppress the observation.
Sure, Disraeli will feel 'twill be wrong to badger PEEL,
So will Roebuck to vituperate his betters;
And DUNcoMBE will refrain, very likely, to complain,
Though again they shall have open'd all his letters.
Chorus. For it won't do, just now, to be factious, &c.
PLUMPTRE and Spoon ER, too, will perceive it will not do
To be canting upon Sunday legislation;
And INGL1s, like a goose, to vent impotent abuse
On Maynooth and comprehensive education ;
And, for Old Ireland's weal will O'Connell drop Repeal,
Whilst her real want so vehemently presses,
And labour, like a man, to do everything he can
To alleviate her positive distresses.
Chorus. For it won't do, just now, to be factious, &c.
We're now in a condition that requires no Opposition;
It is necessary we should be united,
Forgetting party broils, and combined in common toils,
Till, at any rate, affairs are somewhat righted.
We are in such a hobble that we can't afford to squabble,
Let us quarrel in more favourable weather;
But, whilst the storm shall last, and until the danger's past,
We must all of us resolve to pull together.
Chorus. For it won't do, just now, to be factious, &c.
PEEL'S PORTRAIT GALLERY.
SEVERAL of our contemporaries have been giving very interesting
details respecting a portrait galiery which SIB Robert PEEL has lately
formed with much completeness. Politicians of every shade and every
turn are to be found ranged side by side in this remarkable collection.
It is not, however, generally known that the room is lighted by a
lantern in the centre, which represents on its six sides the portraits of the
proprietor in six of his most favourite characters. The lantern is a
revolving one, so that SIR Robert PEEL is represented in such a
manner as to enable him to keep all his friends in countenance. The
room is full of all the lights of the age, but the great revolving light
of the age most appropriately occupies the centre. He appears as the
man who plays on six different instruments, the knave of diamonds,
and other roles he has filled in the course of his rollings.
--
PAINLESS SURGICAL OperaTIONS.
THE establishment of the fact that surgical operations may be per-
formed without pain, has been properly described as “Good News for
Travellers by Railway.”
BINDING TREATIES.
Louis-PHILIPPE's speech announces the conclusion of a treaty with
the EMPERoR NICHOLAs. The “Entente Cordiale” hitherto has been
“done” in England “in the very best calf,” but as it has lately come
to pieces, it seems that, for the future, it is to be “bound in Russia.”.
CON. FOR THE COMMONS.
WHY is LoRD GEORGE BENTINck like the WELLINGTON Statue on
the BURtoN arch 7 Because he wants taking down a peg.

A GENIUS INCOG.
An advertisement in the Atlas and the
| Athenaeum states that “A Reviewer
| will make the reputation of a literary
aspirant in any branch of the belles
lettres, by wholly executing the contem-
| plated work.” This is a chance that
| does not occur every day. Any young
lady or gentleman, ambitious of appear-
ing in print, can achieve a literary
popularity without putting pen to
paper, by applying, cheque-book in
hand, to the above diffident genius. It
does not matter what the subject of
the “contemplated work” may be ;
history, romance, opera, quack adver-
tisements, bombon mottoes, an article
on the steam-engine, or logarithms
turned into poetry and fun, it is all the
same to “X. Y. Z.” We wonder if he
out. We can imagine it runs in the
following style :-
A soft, sentimental, moonlight, love-and-dove song - - -

Nor is there any fear of any of these articles not being properly
treated, for “X. Y. Z.” tells us himself that he is “the author of well-
reputed and successful works, on the parentage of which the seal of
secrecy is imposed.” Who can this genius incog. be 2 Is he the
author of the “Vestiges of Creation,” or Moses' advertisements, or
the “New Timon,” and numerous other bantlings who have no one in
this wide literary world whom they can call father ? We hope some
one will break this “seal of mystery.” Will SIR JAMEs GRAHAM try
his hand upon it? Who knows?—a second SHAKspeARE, a duplicate
GRANT, may be brought forth from the envelope which conceals those
three mysterious letters, “X.Y.Z.!” Canit possibly be Lord Brough AM 7
It is lucky the advertisement says “strictly confidential; ” for it
would be rather awkward if a lord paid liberally for a work, which was
published with his name and title, and “X. Y. Z.” afterwards claimed it.
Such an accident would be as distressing as the melancholy contretemps,
which happened three years ago to Lord WILLIAM LENNox. We warn
the aristocracy against a similar calamity
ROBBERY OF MOUNT PARNASSU.S.
It is indeed a sign of the badness of the times with the predatory
fraternity, for we see by the papers, that a robbery has actually been
committed on Mount Parnassus. We should as soon have expected
to hear of a burglary in a poet's attic, as the plunder of the home
of the Muses, which has recently been effected by some desperate
brigands. We must not, however, be surprised at what has occurred
abroad, when we think of the depredations that have been committed
at home, on property of a similar description to that which we should
suppose to abound in the regions of Parnassus.
The poverty of the spoil to be anticipated, is perhaps the most
wonderful feature of the burglary committed upon the home of the
Muses. It is not unlikely that the robbers were tempted by some
unprincipled persons in this country, who are in the habit of receiving
stolen articles of the description that would probably be met with on
Mount Parnassus.
THE ST. STEPHEN'S STEEPLE-CHASE.
A GRAND heat was run in the House of Commons on the day of the
opening of Parliament. The number that started is not exactly known,
but there was a strong muster in the field, every one of whom was in
good condition. The distance to be run was from CANNING's Statue to
the seat of the leader of the Opposition on the left of the St. Stephen's
training-ground.
Upper Benjamin (DISRAELI) took the lead, but Sancho Panza (BoFTH-
wick) was close upon his heels. They were followed by Bath Brick,
(Roebuck), and Brazennose (INGLIS), Bumpkin (BANREs), Grimaldi
(SIBTHoRPE), and others of a like breed, who soon broke down, for
want of mettle. At this point, The Hope of the Country (BENTINck)
came out very strong, but at the corner the Manchester Pet (LINcoLN),
who had been hitherto in the rear, made a rush, and passed the Hope
of the Country with the greatest ease. After this he had the running
all to himself. He cleared the different benches in the most masterly
style, and, jumping over all the forms of the House without once
stumbling, he reached the seat amid the cheers of his backers, and
was declared the winner. The value of the prize is not yet known.
Some say the stakes will be forfeited, as the Manchester Pet did not
start fairly, whilst others maintain that he was not entered properly.
We give the order of the high-mettled steeds as they came in :-
The Manchester Pet - - - - - -
The Hope of the Country . - - - -
Grimaldi - - - - -
Upper Benjamin - - -
Won cleverly by several full-lengths.
:
Slow Coach (HUDsoN) did not come in till half an hour afterwards.
It was whispered at BELLAMY's, that LoRD GEORGE intended to chal-
lenge the winner in a few days, as he had made up his book purposely
to go in and win. The last betting was 50 to 1 against him, freely
taken.
THE PRINCE OF WALES'S CHAIR.
The pretty little Chair to be placed on the right hand of the Throne,
for the pretty little PRINCE of WALEs, has been a general object of
affectionate interest. Unfortunately, however, while his Royal High-
ness is happily growing bigger every year, the pretty little Chair never
grows at all, and there must be a sad want of proportion between the
seat and its intended occupant. We can only recommend the application
of horticultural skill in such a manner that the Chair may be planted
in the ground, made of the wood of some living tree, and trained or
kept clipped in the form that may be required to suit the increasing
dimensions of Walesian Royalty.
Something of this sort must be done, for it is terrible to contemplate
the Prince outgrowing his chair, and giving to an object of taste and
elegance an air of awkwardness. Though his Royal Highness at his
present size would adorn the present Chair, what will be the effect
when, no longer a pretty little child in infantine tunic, he becomes a
boy in straps—or to use one expressive word—a strapper ? When he
passes into a state of manhood, his position on the Child's Chair will
be agonisingly inappropriate. We should be sorry indeed to observe
the Heir to the Throne facing the Legislative Assembly with his legs
forming a most uncomfortable N, and presenting altogether an awful
picture of Royalty cramped to a degree which, as loyal subjects, we
could never witness without a feeling of the deepest solicitude.
A very Natural Mistake.
“St. PAUL’s. CLosing For THREE WEEKs.”—An advertisement, thus
headed, appeared the other day in the Times. At first we supposed it
related to the Dean and Chapter's Exhibition ; but found, upon ex-
|amination, that it referred to a shop called Albion House.

MR. PLUMPTRE'S CALL.
MR. PLUMPTRE, on the question that the Report on the Address be
read, speaking of the state of Ireland, expressed himself, according to
the Times, as follows:–
“He did not mean to enter at large into the question where the guilt which had
drawn down upon them this tremendous dispensation lay—whether that guilt lay with
the people or #. rulers; but he could not help expressing what he considered to be a
well-founded opinion, that the rulers of this country had deeply offended by some acts
which they had recently placed on the statute book, and which in his belief were calcu-
lated to bring down the Divine displeasure on the land; but into this he would
not enter.”
What did MR. PLUMPTRE mean by these observations ? Did he
mean to accuse SIR Robert PEEL and the late Ministry of having
passed Acts of Parliament so wicked as to have incurred the vengeance
of Heaven This must have been his meaning, if he had any. And
is there nothing unparliamentary—not to say, presumptuous—in one
honourable gentleman imputing to others criminality of so heinous a
description ? Surely, an Act of Parliament should be unmistakeably
blasphemous, should be palpably impious, to justify such a charge as
this. What is the legislative impiety or blasphemy of which MR.
PLUMPTRE accuses SIR Robert PEEL 7 Name, good sir; name, name.
Is it the Maynooth Grant, or the Repeal of the Corn Laws 7 for with
your very peculiarly constituted mind, it is as likely that you allude
to the one measure as to the other. -
In the meantime, MR. PLUMPTRE, you will be pleased to observe,
that it is not on the mansion of Tamworth, nor on BELLAMY's coffee-
room, that has fallen this plague of famine. The scourge has left the
actual delinquents—such, according to your charitable supposition—
untouched. And if Ireland suffers for the sins of her rulers, are you
quite certain that she suffers for those of her recent government
May not her sufferings be partly attributable to the offences of former
legislators 2 Are you, indeed, absolutely positive that they are owing
to the guilt of any persons in particular If you are, will you con-
descend to tell us whence you have derived your information ? In
short, MR. PLUMPTRE, are you a prophet, or what are you ? For,
either your language is truly prophetic, or it is not remarkably
Christian.
E-
AN ANSWER IS WANTED.
WILL MR. DANIEL O'Connell have the goodness to tell us what has
become of his beautiful maxim—“England's need is Ireland's oppor-
tunity ?” Recent events in the two countries should convince him
that England's treatment towards Ireland is exactly the reverse.

very Ominous.
It is a remarkable fact, and is very symptomatic of the state of the
political world at the present moment, that the horses of HER MAJESTY's
Carriage the other day, in going down to the House of Lords, refused
most obstinately to follow their leaders. Just as the QUEEN left the
Palace, a fog of considerable denseness suddenly came down, as if to be
in character with the obscurity that at present overhangs the coming
events of the Session.

LoRD GEoRGE BENTINck intends getting up a Protectionist party.
Tickets have been issued to all the Agriculturist members. The large
rooms, at 54, New Bond Street, have been engaged, and a transparency
of the “Coming Man” is to be painted expressly for it. As the figure
is, at present, in the greatest obscurity, it would be premature on our
part to throw any light upon the person it is meant to represent.
There is a jockey's cap, however, which is wonderfully thrown in.
The costume of the members who attend this party is to be Lincoln
reen.
g SIR. Robert PEEL has declared his intention of entertaining no party,
or following any, this session. He has disbanded all his suite, who will
get up a series of small parties on their own account. Several soirées,
for instance, will be given by the Young England party, at which the
usual course of entertainments will be provided by MR. DisrAELI, with
the customary display of squibs and fireworks. Mr. PETER Borthwick,
who is the very man for a small party, is engaged to play one of the
first fiddles, (they are limited to a dozen,) and will amuse the company
with a new “Spanish Dance” of his own composing.
There has been published as yet, no announcement of the Liberal
parties, but from the arrangements that have been made, we have
every right to expect that the amusements generally furnished at their
expense will not be in the least diminished this session. MR. HuME,
as usual, will have the talented superintendence of the checks. - MR.
WILLIAMs has kindly undertaken the inspection of the vouchers;
another member has promised before the dissolution several cargoes of
cheap tea; whilst LoRD John Russell is pledged for sugar and other
sweets, MR. Roebuck for the bitters, and MR. BRIGHT's name is down
upon the lists for universal game. All these preparations are most
cheering; but some little terror has been caused by MR. Brotherton
sending word that the party must break up every evening at twelve
o'clock, or else he will bring the House about the members' ears. .
OIL FOR IRISH LIGHT-Houses.
THE Dublin Corporation advertise for a supply of the above com-
modity. Could not Mr. O'Connell supply the native article; no man
being a greater holder of Irish Palm-oil than the honourable gentleman?
Colonel SIBTHoRPE suggests that the WELLINgrox Statue be used
for the purpose of filling up the breach between France and England.
We are afraid even that is not large enough.
THE CONDE DE MONTEMOLIN.
AMong the numerous visits paid by the CoNDE to objects and places
of interest, the papers have omitted to mention the call made by His
Majesty at the chambers of MR. BRIEFLEss. The ConDE was received
at the outer door by Thompson, the clerk in waiting, who preceded His
Majesty along the grand matted corridor, at the end of which Mr.
BRIEFLEss was standing, to escort his royal visitor to the western
chamber. The CoNDE was occupied for some minutes in looking over
a rule to compute, and asked several questions on the subject of com-
putation, all of which were answered by the learned host with prompt
alacrity. The CoNDE was then ushered into the robing closet, where
the wig and gown of MR. BRIEFLEss were shown to the illustrious
guest, who, on hearing the wig was made of horse-hair, told some
interesting anecdotes of the horse, and expressed his admiration of the
skill exhibited in preparing the hair of that noble animal.
The CoNDE then inspected the gown with great minuteness, and
entered into a succinct history of the Spanish Inquisition, of which he
said the black gown had reminded him. His Majesty was then con-
ducted in front of the façade of the grand book-cases, and was pleased
to express his royal approbation of the taste displayed in forming the
library. On seeing upon the shelf a thick volume, called the Attorney's
Pocket-Book, the CoNDE good-humouredly remarked, that “he did not
wonder at a book being so large when it was intended for pockets so
very capacious as those of the attornies.” MR. BRIEFLEss smiled, and
“Thomson caught faintly the joke as it fell”
from the lips of His Majesty. The CoNDE having partaken of a mutton
pie, retired highly delighted with his visit.
PEEL'S POLITICAL DINNER.
Though it is quite true, as stated by our contemporaries, that SIR
RoBERT PEEL gave no political dinner on the occasion of the opening of
Parliament, it is not perhaps generally known that he took a sort of
demi-diplomatic luncheon at the Punch Office. Stout and stilton for two
were served on the large counter; and the ex-Premier seemed to enjoy
his host's frugal but substantial hospitality. SIR Ropert consulted Mr.
Punch as to the attitude to be assumed in Parliament by a retired
Minister, and as to the propriety of his supporting the present
Government. In this manner the distinguished couple indulged in
“genial discourse unblamed,” as our old friend in the lace collar—we
mean MILTON.—expressively hath it. Mr. Punch made some perti-
ment observations on the production of beer from sugar, which, if not
liked, might be easily lumped; and went somewhat deeply into the
statistics of stout, by the aid of that useful manual called—“Porter's
Progress of the Nation.” Mr. Punch then gave a toast, and SIR
Robert PEEL a sentiment, after which the distinguished pair sepa-
rated, highly delighted at the result of the interview.
--
NE SUTOR, &c.
WE understand that Mr. DuNN, the ex-suitor of Miss BURDETT
Courts, has protested on his own account against the Spanish mar-
riages. He declares himself, at least, entitled to compensation on the
ground of his having intended himself for the hand of the Queen, or at
least, of her sister the Infanta.

has such a voice as to make it appear that he sings from his eyes and
ears. This will enable him to sing a quartette all by himself for what
with a voice in each ear, and the assistance of his two favourite pupils
in his eyes, he can make up four parts with the greatest, facility.
His eyes will probably be merely secondary in his musical efforts|

A POLITICAL FLIRT.
LoRD BRough AM, after his long flirtation with France, seems disposed
to make amorous advances towards Austria. His Lordship has declared
himself particularly anxious for an alliance with the latter, and says
he is, at heart, thoroughly wedded to that country. The only lawful
connexion he is capable of forming is with England, but he has jilted
her long ago, to take up with France, which he is now desirous of
cutting for a newer attachment. We trust the poverty of France is
not, the cause of the ex-Chancellor's coldness. We hope it will not
pass into a proverb, that “When trouble comes in at the door, LoRD
BROUGHAM flies out at the window.” We do not know what England
will say to this second foreign attachment. BRough AM, with Austria
on one hand, and France on the other, singing “How happy could I
be with either,” would form a very striking picture.

The Vultures of Parliament-
THE political naturalist will beinterested to know that there exists
in these islands a peculiar species of vulture, which has not as yet
been described in our national ornithologies. These vultures are com-
monly called Parliamentary Agents; and the propriety of their classi-
fication with the Vulture tribe has been established by the complaint
of “A Victim,” in the Times. This individual states, that, for the
mere procuring of an Act of Parliament, unopposed, for the purpose of
improving his own estate, he had to pay £1,850, of which no less than
|csoo was swallowed up by these Agents. It thus appears that in
voracity these creatures equal the Condor itself. It may not, unhap-
pily, be possible to effect their extirpation; but surely some effectual
means of protection ought to be adopted against their ravages.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IT is gratifying to know that the late severe frost has not been with-
out its agreeable influence. One of its happiest effects has been to
bring about a pleasant understanding between the police and the
people, who have been found skating and sliding together most
amicably in the public thoroughfares. At Trafalgar Square, in parti-
cular, it was delicious to see the civil power helping to keep the pot
boiling down a long slide, in conjunction with a troop of boys, coal-
heavers, and others, who help to make up the “only true source of
legitimate power.” As slides in the public thoroughfares, during the
frost, are now “great facts,” which the police officially recognise, there
is only one thing to be desired, namely, that some little order should be
observed on the foot-pavements, so as to make a slide a convenient and
rapid mode of transit. We think the police should have instructions
skATING IN FLEET street.
- - * -
to “cut out” two series of slides at an early hour of the morning,
before the walking traffic begins, and that one series should go up, the
other down, the pathway of all the principal streets in London. Every
pedestrian should be made to fall into his place upon the slide, so that
no obstruction might be experienced to anybody. We are sure if this
plan were adopted at anytime when a heavy frost returns to us, it
would be found a great public convenience. By the present system,
under which slides are merely tolerated, and are only partially carried
out, some of the public who are unprepared for them, keep tumbling
about in a very awkward manner. A well-regulated routine of slides,
under the control of the police, would be an understood accommodation
for all, and order could easily be preserved, by sending policemen up.
and down each series of slides at proper intervals.

pleted; but we are enabled to announce that MR.

as vigorous as ever upon the big drums or gross cases. -
The novelties will be numerous; but several works from the old
répertoire of the few last seasons will be again brought forward.
Lord JoHN RUssell will act as conductor, and is in hopes of com-
pleting some production which will give an opportunity for a combi-
nation of all the principal political artists in one grand piece of har-
mony. We understand that an Irish subject is one of the first that
this grand experiment will be tried upon.

FRANCE IN DIFFICULTIES.
Poor France is in a frightful pecuniary mess at the present
moment. Her revenue is fearfully below her expenditure; her debt
is tremendous, and her Bank is so poor as to be positively compelled to
borrow “a little silver” of ours. Under these circumstances two
questions are being asked by everybody, namely—First, What's to
be done? and secondly, Who’s to do it? It is expected she will be
compelled to sell the fortifications of Paris for old building materials;
and that, her new and expensive Marine must be offered to some
wealthier dealer in marine stores as soon as possible.
We think there is one source of relief which France may justly
claim at the hands of England. The large sums of money recently
made by English managers from pieces stolen from the French, ought,
we think, if not to be wholly refunded, at least lent to relieve the
pressure prevailing in Paris at the present moment.
PLINY AND PUMP-WATER.
Hades. Sixth of the Kalends of Feb., U.C. 2600.
Most celebrated PUNCH,
THY fame hath descended even into these regions, for who of
all those who, daily arrive here bringeth not a report thereof * This
letter, therefore, I address unto thee, in order that it may be the more
widely circulated. To me, demanding of new-comers to our dominions,
in what place in the world they have existed, they, being your fellow-
citizens, are wont to answer: From the first city in Europe. Where-
upon, indeed, I have saluted them as countrymen and Romans; but
they, truly, have then informed me that they were Londoners. And, I
disputing the claim of London to pre-eminence, they have urged
against me its greater magnitude, and its superiority to Rome in the
arts and conveniences of life. But when I have questioned them of
their supply of water therein, they have been forced to confess them-
selves inferior to the Romans. For, whereas in Rome there were
not more than one million of inhabitants, for whom, of water were
furnished fifty millions of cubic feet; in London, where the population
is twice as great, the provision of water is less by nearly a twentieth
part. And yet they have assured me, that beneath their city there
lieth a vast and deep bed of chalk, wherein by penetrating, as hath in
a few instances been done, and at no very great expense, as abundant
a plenty of pure water as can be desired can very easily be obtained.
Which circumstances having considered, I have conceived it a no
small reproach to the London people, or at least to their government
and rulers, that they are so miserably in want of water; without the
aid of which fluid, and a sufficiency of soap, neither can the precepts
of cleanliness nor the public health be consulted. Farewell.
Thy Subscriber, in the Shades,
PLINY THE ELDER.

A New Opening for France.
FRANCE has concluded a treaty with Russia. The particulars have
not yet transpired, but one of the most important articles, we have
been informed, is that the mines of Siberia are to be thrown open un-
conditionally to all French political offenders. The traffic, it is ex-

chains.

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND. "
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER XLIX.-CLUB SNOBS.
very well-bred English female will
sympathise with the subject of the
harrowing tale, the history of SACK-
VILLE MAINE, I am now about to
recount. The pleasures of Clubs have
been spoken of: let us now glance for a
moment at the dangers of those insti-
\ tutions, and for this purpose I must
introduce you to my young acquaint-
ance, SACKville MAINE.
It was at a ball at the house of my
respected friend, MRs. PERKINs, that I
was introduced to this gentleman and
his charming lady. Seeing a young
creature before me in a white dress,
with white satin shoes ; with a pink
- ribbon, about a yard in breadth, flaming
| \ \ out as she twirled in a Polka in the
- arms of Monsieur DE SPRINGBock,
the German diplomatist ; with a green wreath on her head, and the
blackest hair this individual ever set eyes on—seeing, I say, before
me a charming young woman, whisking beautifully in a beautiful
dance, and presenting, as she wound and wound round the room, now
a full face, then a three-quarter face, then a profile–a face, in fine,
which, in every way you saw it, looked pretty, and rosy, and happy,
I felt (as I trust) a not unbecoming curiosity regarding the owner of
this pleasant countenance, and asked WAGLEY (who was standing by,
in conversation with an acquaintance) Who was the lady in question ?
“Which 7" says WAGLEY.
“That one with the coal-black eyes,” I replied.
“Hush,” says he, and the gentleman with whom he was talking
moved off, with rather a discomfited air.
When he was gone WAGLEY burst out laughing. “Coal-black eyes l’”
said he “you’ve just hit it. That's MRs. SACKVILLE MAINE,
and that was her husband who just went away. He's a coal-
merchant, SNoB, my boy, and I have no doubt MR. PERKINs's Walls-
ends are supplied from his wharf. He is in a flaming furnace when
he hears coals mentioned. He and his wife and his mother are very
proud of MRs. SACKville's family; she was a Miss CHUFF, daughter
of CAPTAIN CHUFF, R.N. That is the widow : that stout woman, in
crimson tabbinet, battling about the odd trick with old MR. DUMPs,
at the card-table.”
And so, in fact, it was. SACKVILLE MAINE (whose name is a
hundred times more elegant, surely, than that of CHUFF) was blest
with a pretty wife, and a genteel mother-in-law, both of whom some
people may envy him.
Soon after his marriage the old lady was good enough to come and
pay him a visit—just for a fortnight—at his pretty little cottage,
Kennington Oval ; and, such is her affection for the place, has never
quitted it these four years. She has also brought her son, Nelson
Collingwood Chure, to live with her ; but he is not so much at
home as his mamma, going as a day-boy to Merchant Tailors' School,
where he is getting a sound classical education.
If these beings, so closely allied to his wife, and so justly dear to
her, may be considered as drawbacks to MAINE’s happiness, what
man is there that has not some things in life to complain of ? And
when I first knew MR. MAINE, no man seemed more comfortable than
he. His cottage was a picture of elegance and comfort ; his table
and cellar were excellently and neatly supplied. There was every
enjoyment, but no ostentation. The omnibus took him to business of
a morning ; the boat brought him back to the happiest of homes,
where he would while away the long evenings by reading out the
fashionable novels to the ladies as they worked ; or accompany his
wife on the flute (which he played elegantly); or in any one of the
hundred pleasing and innocent amusements of the domestic circle.
MRs. CHUFF covered the drawing-rooms with prodigious tapestries,
the work of her hands. MRs. SACKville had a particular genius for
making covers of tape or net-work for these tapestried cushions. She
-
Elliºn. * Lºlº
could make home-made wines. She could make preserves and pickles. |
She had an album, into which, during the time of his courtship,
SACKVILLE MAINE had written choice scraps of ByRoN and MooRE's
poetry, analogous to his own situation, and in a fine mercantile hand.
She had a large manuscript receipt-book—every quality, in a word,
which indicated a virtuous and well-bred English female mind.
“And as for NELson Collingwood,” SACKville would say, laughing,
“we couldn't do without him in the house. If he didn't spoil the
tapestry we should be over-cushioned in a few months ; and whom
could we get but him to drink LAURA’s home-made wine?” The truth
is, the gents who came from the city to dine at the Oval could not be
induced to drink it, in which fastidiousness, I myself, when I grew to
be intimate with the family, confess that I shared.
“And yet, sir, that green ginger has been drunk by some of
England's proudest heroes,” MRs. CHUFF would exclaim ; “ADMIRAL
LoRD ExMouth tasted and praised it, sir, on board CAPTAIN CHUFF's
ship, the Nebuchadnezzar, 74, at Algiers; and he had three dozen with
him in the Pitchfork frigate, a part of which was served out to the men,
before he went into his immortal action with the Furibonde, CAPTAIN
Choufleur, in the Gulf of Panama.”
All this, though the old dowager told us the story every day when the
wine was produced, never served to get rid of any quantity of it—and
the green ginger, though it had fired British tars for combat and vic-
tory, was not to the taste of us peaceful and degenerate gents of modern
times.
I see SACKVILLE now, as on the occasion when presented by WAGLEY,
I paid my first visit to him. It was in July—a Sunday afternoon—
SAckville MAINE was coming from church, with his wife on one arm,
and his mother-in-law (in red tabbinet, as usual) on the other. A
half-grown, or hobbadehoyish footman, so to speak, walked after
them, carrying their shining golden prayer-books—the ladies had
splendid parasols with tags and fringes.
watch, fastened to her stomach, gleamed there like a ball of fire.
NElson Collingwood was in the distance, shying stones at an old
horse on Kennington Common. 'Twas on that verdant spot we met—
nor can I ever forget the majestic courtesy of Mrs CHUFF, as she re-
membered having had the pleasure of seeing me at MRs. PERKINs's—
nor the glance of scorn which she threw at an unfortunate gentleman
who was preaching an exceedingly desultory discourse to a sceptical
MRs. CHUFF's great gold
audience of omnibus-cads and nurse-maids, on a tub, as we passed by.
“I cannot help it, Sir,” says she “I am the widow of an officer of
Britain's navy : I was taught to honour my Church and my King :
and I cannot bear a Radical, or a Dissenter.”
With these fine principles I found SACRVILLE MAINE impressed.
“WAGLEY,” said he, to my introducer, “if no better engagement, why
shouldn't self and friend dine at the Oval 2 MR. SNoB, Sir, the
mutton's coming off the spit at this very minute. LAURA and MRs.
CHUFF, (he said Laurar and MRs. CHUFF ; but I hate people who
make remarks on these peculiarities of pronunciation,) will be most
happy to see you; and I can promise you a hearty welcome, and as
good a glass of port-wine as any in England.”
“This is better than dining at the Sarcophagus,” thinks I to
myself, at which club WAGLEY and I had intended to take our meal;
and so we accepted the kindly invitation, whence arose afterwards a
considerable intimacy.
Everything about this family and house was so good-natured, com-
fortable, and well-conditioned, that a Cynic would have ceased to growl
there. MRs. LAURA was all graciousness and smiles, and looked to as
great advantage in her pretty morning gown as in her dress robe at
MRs. PERRINs's. MRs. CHUFF fired off her stories about the Nebu-
chadnezzar, 74, the action between the Pitchfork and the Furibonde
—the heroic resistance of CAPTAIN Choufleur, and the quantity of
snuff he took, &c., &c.; which, as they were heard for the first time,
were pleasanter than I have subsequently found them. SACKVILLE
MAINE was the best of hosts. He agreed in everything everybody
said, altering his opinions without the slightest reservation upon the
slightest possible contradiction. He was not one of those beings who
would emulate a SchoNBEIN or FRIAR BAcon, or act the part of an
incendiary towards the Thames, his neighbour—but a good, kind,
simple, honest, easy fellow—in love with his wife—well-disposed to all
the world—content with himself, content even with his mother-in-
law. NElson Collingwood, I remember, in the course of the evening,
when whisky and water was for some reason produced, grew a little
tipsy. This did not in the least move SACKville's equanimity.
“Take him up stairs, Joseph,” said he to the hobbadehoy, “and–
Joseph-don't tell his Mamma.”
What could make a man so happily disposed unhappy 7 What
could cause discomfort, bickering, and estrangement in a family so
friendly and united 2 Ladies, it was not my fault—it was MRs.
CHUFF's doing—but the rest of the tale you shall have on a
future day.

---- OET BUNN AND THE SWEDISH NIGHTINGALE.
ºw Ş - *Whateven is, has been, say the philosophers ; and we believe
it. A musician—“a sweet lute's-master”—once upon a time had a
contention with a nightingale, “Hard by the stream of Tiber.” He
dared her to sing against his mastery. She warbled and was overcome.
Old CRASHAw has the story—
(“Now, who was CRAsHAw?” asks a “fast” one of the Rising Gene-
ration. “Somebody, devilish slow, no doubt I Who was CRAshaw 2"
We set aside the snob, and go on.)
Old CRASHAw has the story enshrined in divinest words; and the
Poet BUNN and the Swedish Nightingale arise to the imagination
as we read the ancient verse. Imagine the Poet BUNN with his lyre.
He plays, instead of writes, a letter to JENNY LIND :—
“His nimble hands instinct have taught each string
A capering cheerfulness, and made them sing
To their own dance; now negligently rash
He throws his arm, and with a long-drawn dash
Blends all together; then distinctly trips
From this to that; then quick returning skips
And snatches this again, and pauses there?"
Now is not this one of the poet's letters, set to music * The very
letter, lately despatched by BUNN, the Bard, to the Swedish Nightin-
gale 2 And—
“She measures every measure; everywhere
Meets art with art; sometimes as if in doubt,
Not perfect yet, and fearing to be out,
Trails her plain ditty in one long-spun note,
Through the sleek passage of her open throat,
A clear unwrinkled song.”
Saying plainly—"Poet BUNN; I will not come; and law shan't
make me.”
* Whereupon, the Poet BUNN takes another turn at And she, feeling that the Poet BUNN

“From this to that, from that to this he flies, Yet summons all her sweet powers for a note.

THE FINE ARTS AT EVERY STATION.
FELIX SUMMERLY, in the Athenaeum, recommends the decoration of
railway stations. The reasons he advances are so sensible that we
have no doubt his recommendation will speedily be put into the hands
of some talented R.A. for execution. The struggle amongst the
companies will be which shall have the finest collection of paintings.
These might be exchanged after a time—the Southampton lending its
pictures to the Birmingham—the Birmingham to the Brighton—and
so on, through the whole series of railways—by which arrangement
every station would have a new exhibition of Etry's and LANDseBR's,
every year, without any additional expense. For this reason, we think
oil-paintings preferable to frescoes, which would be too stationary, in
the most literal sense of the word, besides falling a certain prey, in
the event of fire—for who could remove an entire wall (unless, per-
haps, it was a party) whilst the next room was in flames —whereas
the most lackadaisical clerk could take a TURNER off the hooks, or put
a MAcLise under his arm, without fear or injury.
Subjects will be wanted, and as one of the objects of these decora-
tions will be to drive away ennui and inspire patience into the
passengers whilst waiting for a train, we think artists should strive
to select such subjects as will inculcate fortitude, and heroism, and all
the stoical virtues necessary in moments, or rather hours, of delay,
suffering, and hardship. The Spartan and Roman annals should be
ransacked for this purpose, whilst many a noble hint might be borrowed
from the savage chivalry of the persecuted Indians.
We dot down a few suggestions, which any railway is welcome to.
1. PENELoPE and Ulysses meeting “after many roving years.”
2. LATUDE in the Bastille, having nothing to do, tames a fly.
3. The one PolicEMAN of Herne Bay, reading the Morning Herald,
stretched on the sea-shore.
4. A Scene from the Gravesend Famine, 1845; the 500 passengers
of the Lively steamer drawing lots off Erith for the last herring and
the remainder of a pint of shrimps.
5. A View of Smithfield on a Market Day—during July—one mad
bull coming in collision with another—whilst another is seen running
headlong into a full omnibus. Universal alarm, and flight of horses,
pigs, old women, children, and everybody.
6. Robinson CRusoe, taking his likeness from the shadow of his
profile on the wall.
7. RUMoUR, riding a la Courier de St. Petersburg, on the five
wires of the Electric Telegraph ; an allegory of Justice overtaking
Crime—the latter personified by a gentleman with mustachios in the
first class not having paid his fare.
8. The Passengers of the Celerity omnibus waving their handker-
chiefs as the Bank appears in sight, after a three hours' run from the
White Horse Cellar. An incident during the repairs of Fleet-street,
1846.
9. The Mishaps of John Gilpis, drawn in a number of divisions,
like Monsieur WIEUXBois.
10. SHADEs waiting on the banks of the Styx to be ferried over by
CHARON.
11. A Shareholder of the English Opera House waiting for a dividend.
12. The Martyr SMITH O'BRIEN in the cellar of the House of Com-
mons, taking a melancholy dish of tea.
13. A Protectionist speaking in the House of Commons—extreme
fatigue and nausea of the Members.
14. The Railway King—driving from a triumphal first-class chariot
four-and-twenty railway engines, all running different directions—
north, east, and west—at eighty miles an hour. Stage coaches, and
skeletons of horses, strewed upon the ground. Fairy stokers, flying
above him, blowing tremendous trumpets. Triumphal arch in the
distance, decorated with innumerable crowns,and with ForTUNE standing
on the top, holding the Bank of England dangling by a string. Old
TIME, lagging behind, in the distance, quite broken-winded. Rainbow
of coloured purses in the sky.
15. The Survivor of a Chancery suit—a very old man, with an Old
PARR's beard, being presented with a brobdignaggian bill of costs.
* All these subjects are very pictorial. Many of them, of course,
might be executed, out of compliment to royal taste, in the present
fashionable German style. The PENELoPE and John GILPIN subjects
are beautifully adapted for the hard, kitchen-poker drawing of that
gracefully stiff lay-figure school. The terrors of Smithfield Market
would have every justice done to them by Edwin LANDSEER, and
would convince the timid old ladies and nervous old gentlemen that
there are greater dangers on land than there are on rail. We can
imagine a mad bull, in the hands of LANDseeR, would make us run,
merely to look at him. We should be carried away with the notion
that he was close at our heels, and should make all speed for the first
butcher's shop—the only place which a mad bull has an aversion to
entering. The Flying Rumour and Railway King should be left to the
poetic imagination of TURNER, who would turn over his Pleasures of
Memory (unpublished MS.) for some apt, wild, beautifully incompre-
hensible illustration. The Famine on board the Gravesend Steamer is
peculiarly a subject for Poole, who would go far beyond his celebrated
Plague of London, we are confident, in depicting the horrors of dis-
appointed appetite. He would give us the innocent child screaming
for its evening's pap—and the stupendous alderman, with a face the
colour of old stilton, sighing in despair for his daily turtle ! The
others are pretty little poems, which Dyce, HERBERT, LEsli.E, and
HUNT would make imperishable gems of, in their own brilliant way.
We present them to the British nation. The husband anxious to get
home in time for dinner—the lover burning to prove his punctual
affection—the merchant in a fever to take up a bill—the wife on pins
and needles for the evening's opera—and the housemaid looking for-
ward to nine o'clock, to open the area gate, in answer to the familiar
whistle of her “dear B 49”—will all thank us, as they are kept waiting
three or four hours at some lonely railway station, without a novel, or
a glass of wine, or a captain's biscuit, for having refreshed them with
new hope by the contemplation of such invigorating subjects.

STICKS IN WAITING
A PHILANTHRoP1st is so hurt with the melancholy look-out of the
scaffolding round the WELLINGTON Statue that he wishes to know
whether a Ball could be got up for the Distressed Poles 2
THE PSEUDO-SAINTS OF LIVERPOOL.
LoRD BRough AM, whatever may be thought by some people, is still
capable of talking very sensibly when he pleases. Witness the fol-
lowing observations of his lordship's, delivered by him recently,
according to the Times, on the occasion of presenting a petition:—
“He had heard from Liverpool, that about 25,000 paupers were receiving relief there,
only 3,000 of whom were natives of that town, the remainder being Irish, whom the
famine had driven over from their own shores. He was informed, also, that there were
parties in Liverpool who had endeavoured to prevent the opening of the soup-kitchens
on the Sabbath to relieve the wants of these 25,000 persons; forgetting altogether the
example of their Saviour, who, when his disciples were rebuked for plucking ears of corn
upon the Sabbath, declared that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
Sabbath. He would venture to say that those misguided zealots who would prevent the
opening of the soup-kitchens for the poor on Sunday, every one of them ate a hearty
dinner on that day, and that their servants cooked it for them too. (A laugh.)”
Spoken like the late HENRY BRough AM himself. But these Liver-
pool sabbatists are not zealots. A zealot is a religious enthusiast.
Now, what is the religion of this kind of creatures It is not
Christianity; for that teaches that it is lawful to do well on the
Sabbath-day. Their classification, as a sect, rests wholly on certain
externals; for the most part very unprepossessing. Their counte-
nance is bilious, and their voice nasal. They rejoice in doggrel
psalmody. Their conversation is a species of sanctifled slang, inter-
spersed with groans and other uncouth noises. They have an ungainly
habit of turning up their eyes, and depressing the angles of their lips.
These are the grimaces which they make before men; there are
others which they indulge in when alone. In private, they wink the
eye ; in the solitude of the chamber they thrust the tongue into the
cheek. Their religion, in fact, is a mere mask, and a most ugly one
—but very expressive. It has been said that their talk about the
observance of the Sabbath is mere cant. It is worse than that. They
are ready enough to do evil on Sunday. They scruple to open the
doors of Charity on that day; but they do not hesitate to shut them.

THE TASTE OF THE TREADMILL.
| In a document addressed to the Visiting-Justices, the Governor of
the Coldbath Fields House of Correction, states, with reference to labour
on the treadmill, that—
“In proof that it is regarded by many prisoners as calculated to vary the monotony
-- of their confinement, the governor has very frequently been importuned to allow them
º to work on the treadwheel, and many, on having their requests refused, have shed tears
of disappointment.” -

The treadmill has been long established as a specific in cases of
state of things in which the treadmill is a relief. The fact stated by
the Governor of Coldbath Fields is an important revelation. It
shows that the affinity of the workhouse to the prison may be ren-
dered yet closer with advantage; the monotony of confinement in the
Union may admit of the same agreeable variation which diversifies it
at Coldbath Fields. True, labour on the treadmill is very disgraceful,
but so is poverty—according to law. Why not, then, let the tread-
mill be introduced into the poor-house, and allow paupers the option of
a voluntary exercitation on it The permission would be a boon to
them ; they would prefer crushed feelings to crushing bones. Suffer-
ing from cold or from solitude, it would be a comfort to them to “take
a turn on the treadmill.”
he imprisoned squirrel solaces himself with a similar exercise.
The exhibition, however, should be public : for the treadmill un-
doubtedly does not seem so pleasant as it is ; and thus an example
would be afforded to indigence. Hard labour is always recommended
in cases of poverty; yet the treadmill has not been prescribed by
the Poor Law. Wherefore? Perhaps, since the remedy is so much

WONDERFUL EFFECTS OF ETHER IN A CASE OF
SCOLDING WIFE,
LORD BROUGHAM'S GRIEVANCES.
OUR friend LoRD BRough AM is reported, by a morning contempo-
rary, to have favoured the Peers, in Parliament assembled, with the
following important piece of information :-
“LoRD BRough AM said, that, at present, as their Lordships were aware, letters to this
country, from France, Holland and Belgium, and vice versä, were prepaid or not, at the
option of the sender. Since this arrangement took effect he received every morning large
packets of letters, of which he had to pay the postage (a laugh), and which he felt to be a
very great hardship, for he could not tell what they contained until he opened them.
Four or five of the packets he had thus received were directed most perfidiously in the
handwriting of a lady or gentleman, as the case might be, of his acquaintance, as he
thought, and, on opening them, he found them to be quack circulars. (A laugh.) Of
course, he could do nothing but send these communications back under cover, and the
parties would take them in or not, as they chose.”
How defective are the Parliamentary reports of the newspapers
Our contemporary omits to mention that his Lordship proceeded to
complain that—
He (Lord BROUGHAM) had a smoky chimney which, notwithstand-
ing he had had recourse to the best advice, he had not yet been able to
get cured. Amongst the quack circulars which he had just alluded to,
were those of several smoke-doctors; and he had not only to regret
having taken them in, but also having been taken in by them. His
butcher, he was sorry to say, had lately supplied him with very bad
meat; and, to make matters worse, the last joint was underdone,
which was peculiarly annoying, as it happened to be a hand of pork.
Nor was the peas-pudding that accompanied it at all to his satisfac-
tion, and he gave their Lordships notice that he should discharge his
cook. Somebody, he did not know who it was, or he would have
brought the guilty person before the House, had broken his area bell-
wire, and had likewise evidently attempted to pull off his knocker ;
and the pot-boys did sums in arithmetic on his doorposts, or even
defaced them with caricatures, which he had reason to believe were
intended for himself. He would ask their Lordships, did any of them
keep cats 2 (Several noble Lords answered in the affirmative.) Well,
then, he would inquire whether the cats of noble Lords were in the
habit of running away with mince-pies 7 His own cat was ; nay,
even with rounds of beef and shoulders of mutton. There were
draughts in nearly all his rooms; his house was infested with black
beetles; his boots pinched him; and the last pair of trowsers he had
had made, didn't fit. -
The LoRD CHANCELLOR would ask the noble and learned Lord if he
had another complaint to make 2
LoRD BRough AM had to complain of everything and everybody.
The LoRD CHANCELLoR suggested the propriety of proceeding with
the business of the House.
A FACT FOR EXETER HALL.
WE beg to call the attention of certain persons to the following
stroke of Popish craft, recorded by the Leeds Mercury:—
“The Roman Catholic priests of Cracow have given up their revenues for six months,
in . that they may be applied to the relief of the distress which prevails among the
people.
Another instance of the insidious policy of the Papists. Another
proof of the unscrupulous means by which they seek to propagate
their doctrines. Let it not be mistaken for a deed of charity; for
is it possible that Romanists can be capable of any goodness 2
No ; they who read their McNEILE, and attend their platform,
know better. They see that it is only a scheme, a trick, to throw
discredit on sincere professors. It is notorious that the slaves of
Rome, at any time, are ready to go through fire and water for that
purpose. Accordingly, they do not hesitate to commit an act of self-
robbery, aware that our esteemed Bishops and Clergy know too well
what is due to themselves to go and do likewise. The priests of
Cracow expect, no doubt, that their conduct will be quoted as an
example to English Churchmen ; between whom and themselves their
sole object is, of course, to procure an invidious comparison.
We feel that an apology for the above remarks is due to some of our
readers ; but we have to cater for a variety of tastes, and the foregoing
observations are addressed exclusively to our friends of Exeter Hall.
THE WIZARD FOR LINCOLN.
A Few days ago, and we began to think the Church was once again
in danger. Colonel SIBTHoRPE, it was said, would be ousted from
Lincoln ; and, recollecting the intimate connection between the militia
officer and the Church militant, we could not but feel that what would
shake the seat of the one, must affect the foundation of the other.
Happily, our fears are lulled to rest. The good people of Lincoln,
rejecting any new candidate, have resolved to keep the Colonel.
Strange are the effects of use ! We remember the story of an officer
who retired from the field of glory with a bullet in his body; for a
long time the bit of glorious lead teased and fretted the veteran con-
sumedly. Time rolled on, and then he became patient under the bullet;
still time rolled, and he declared that he felt quite an affection for the
bullet. At length, the bullet presented itself under the most favourable
circumstances for extraction. One touch of the knife, and the bullet
would be brought away. The veteran pondered a moment—shook his
head—“No,” said he, “I’ve been so long used to the lead that nothing
now shall part us.” Now, CoLoRELSIBTHoRPE is the bullet of Lincoln.
OST, STOLEN, or STRAYED.—The celebrated British Lion. It was last
heard roaring in the neighbourhood of New Bond Street. Had on, when last
seen, a very shaggy and dishevelled mane, a tail quite down, a seedy coat, and appeared
very much out of spirits. Whoever will bring the Lion, dead or alive, to the Agri-
cultural Protection Society, shall be handsomely rewarded, as the skin may be made
available for some of the Members.
A Domestic Tax.
SoME ladies, of charitable dispositions, have sent a petition to us, in
which they pray that, in the event of a new tax being imposed, which
they state is not at all unlikely, it may be levied upon all members of
clubs. They contend that a more just impost could not be devised,
and as absentees from Ireland are to be heavily taxed, they do not see
why absentees from home, who spend all their money and time abroad,
should be spared. Husbands of England, beware

UNION IS STRENGTH.
Y EveRYBody the inquiry is, “What
will MR. O'Connell's next move
be 7” for the Repeal is all but dead,
and something must be started to
support the number of hands that
will be thrown out of employment
by the stoppage of that great fac-
tory of Agitation—Conciliation Hall.
As MR. O'ConnELL is probably in
want of a notion, we will supply
him gratuitously with one. Let him
advocate the Union, instead of the
Repeal, and do everything in his
power to bring the two countries
together; instead of lending all his
energies, as he has lately done, to
the bitter task of dividing them. It
is much better to make Englishmen
and Irishmen friends than enemies;
for if the two countries are sisters,
it is no reason they should be
always quarreling. They may have
a tiff now and then, as all sisters do, but they generally love each other
all the more for it afterwards. Now, England and Ireland have been
calling one another all sorts of bad names for years past, and have
been ready, upon the very smallest provocation, to tear each other's
eyes out; and it is high time they should make it up. Let them, though
they do live apart, be upon the best visiting terms, and be continually
exchanging presents, and doing everything they possibly can to ad-
vance, by kindness, each other's interests. Depend upon it, they
would find it tend more to their mutual benefit.
Let MR. O'Connell make this principle the subject of his next agi-
tation, and if he only devote to it one half the trouble he has taken
about the agitation of Repeal, the Union will be something more than
nominal ;-for it will be one of truth and goodwill ;-one interest, and
one feeling binding the two countries together—a Union of Love, to
which, as long as it is true on both sides, there never can be a Repeal.
If MR. O'ConnELL will act as sponsor to this Union, and advocate it
with all his energy, talent, and influence, England and Ireland will, in
a very few years, be cited all over the world as the models of affec-
tionate sisters.
Iarºse In 1848.
A Real Calamity,
AT Conciliation Hall a few days ago MR. O'Connell rose with
melancholy face, and said, “I am sorry to say the repeal rent for the
week is only £15 16s. 9d.” Sorry to say it ! With thousands perishing
with hunger For our part, we look upon every farthing paid to the
Repeal Fund at the present time as so much plundered from the bellies
of the famishing. But there are some patriots who would ring shillings
upon coffin-lids.
JOKES IN BOTTLES.
A spirited wine-merchant of the West-End has advertised a new
cordial, under the name of the “Entente Cordiale.” For fear any one
should be deceived by the title, we beg to say we have had a small taste
of this “Entente Cordiale.” We do not mind stating, in confidence, that
it is not a cordial, but a new kind of bitters.
THE LAST DYING SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF
THE POOR-LAW COMMISSIONERS.
3 Cupp uſ [Berges.
FAREwBLL, good friends, if we may call
One man among you friend,
Assembled to behold our fall,
And view our shameful end.
If you would know what brought us here
Your eyes this day before;
'Twas being cruel and severe,
And hard upon the Poor.
Administrators of the laws
Respecting them, ordain'd ;
Against them each oppressive clause
With all our might we strain'd.
With hearts as hard as any flint,
We parted man and wife;
And did so far their diet stint,
It scarce supported life.
We would not listen to their groans
And cries for want of bread:
Instead of meat, we gave them bones
To crack—on which they fed.
We answer'd by the “Workhouse test”
The suppliant for relief:
That is to say, we did our best
To treat him like a thief
Beadles and masters, when they stood
Accused of gross neglect,
Or inhumanity, we would
By every means protect.
Our servant, if a useful one,
Had, like a dog, his day;
But when the dirty work was done,
We threw the tool away.
One, MALTHUs, in our early days,
Did first our minds delude:
We quitted, for his wicked ways,
The paths of rectitude.
In Somerset House we lived like kings,
And carried on the game;
And there it was we did the things
That brought us to this shame.
And now our time has come at last,
Good people, as you see ;
For our misdeeds we're tried and cast,
And doom'd no more to be.
Let our successors warning take
From our unhappy case,
Lest they, like us, an end should make
In sorrow and disgrace.
A PANELESS OPERATION.
To persons who had no umbrellas, the Quadrant used to be a place
of refuge in stormy weather ; but, now that the roof is as full of holes
as a shower-bath, the rain pours through in a manner worthy of the
palmy days of Vauxhall, and the refugee is sure to get a ducking under
false pretences. It is said the shopkeepers keep the holes open for the
purpose of letting them know when it is, what is called, “dirty weather,”
but we should advise them to close the ports, and to get some scientific
man to take out a patent for the improvement of the Quadrant ; for
the public may not like their degree of latitude, and abandon the place
altogether. In the meantime, we caution all persons afflicted with the
rheumatism to avoid the Quadrant; for the paneless operation of
inhaling the “ethereal mildness” of a shower through the roof would,
we are afraid, in their instance, turn out to be nothing better than what
PIERCE EGAN would emphatically call “Walker.”
The Progress of Ether.
WE understand that the inhalation of ether has been resorted to,
professionally, by various pork-butchers with great success. The chief
difficulty they have experienced has consisted in the opposition of the
patient; but when the natural obstinacy of the pig has been overcome,
and he has been persuaded to inhale the ether, he has been killed with
| comfort to himself, and without disturbance to the neighbourhood.

THERE seems to be no end to the new advertising projects which are
daily springing up in all directions. We have advertisements in omni-
buses, placed in such a position, that unless you can turn your eyes
upside down, or sit upon your own head, there is no possibility of read-
ing them. .
As to the advertising-carts, they are now on so gigantic a scale,
that no ordinary vision can take in more than half a letter at a
time—and thus the perambulating van must fall into the rear by the
excess to which the system has been carried. There is, however, still
one method of advertising left untried, and we wonder no one makes

the experiment. Our umbrellas are still left blank, and bear no
announcement of some new pill, new paletot, or new periodical. We are
quite sure that the parapluie is destined to become a tremendous vehicle
for information. An umbrella-maker might try the experiment by
placing a puffing broadside on all the articles of his own manufacture.
Or perhaps it would be a better plan—as some persons might object to
carry an advertising umbrella—that on wet days there should be sta-
tions, with placards ready printed, to be pasted on—for a consideration
—to the umbrellas of any who might be willing to combine profit with
convenience.
METROPOLITAN HouseHoldeRs. CLUB.
WE understand it is in contemplation to get up a Club for the
purpose of endeavouring to improve the quality of Servants. The
indifference of the material is very much against the project, but the
effort is worth making. A few old housekeepers have determined to
set the scheme on foot by offering a few prizes, of which the following
is a Catalogue :— - - *
For the Cook who has lived longest in one place, without including
whole candles under the general head of kitchen-stuff. One pound
For the Nurse who has walked oftenest in the Park without speaking
to a Horse-guard . . . . . . . . . . . . Ten shillings
a Tºm
-
For the Housemaid who has remained longest in a situation in which
the cat has not been in the habit of doing wilful damage to the
Crockery . . . . . . . . . . Five shillings
For the Cook who has been the greatest number of years in service
without resigning her own heart and her mistress's cold meat to
the devouring passion of a policeman . . . . . Fifteen shillings
For the Nurse who has remained the longest time in a place without
mistaking the children's linen for her own, and given the baby the
fewest private punches and pinches - - . Seven shillings
For the Female Servant who has set off on Sunday evenings to go to
Church, and found her way there oftenest - Five shillings
For the Page who has opened the smallest number of notes in the
longest period of service - - - - Half-a-Crown
For the Groom who has best carried out the principles of protection
with regard to his master's corn . - - . . Ten shillings
For the Footman who has worn the fewest of his master's
shirts - - - - - - - - . One shilling
The above are only a few preliminary prizes, but if the scheme can
be effectually carried out, there is every intention to offer rewards for
a variety of other qualities. In the present day, when servants are
always “bettering” themselves, which means growing worse and
worse, the project of a Prize Club for this troublesome class seems
fraught with the most promising prospects.
THE LIGHT OF ALL NATIONS.
THIs well-intended attempt to set up a sort of rushlight on the
Goodwin Sands has signally failed, for within the last few days the
gales have completely extinguished it. We were afraid, from the first,
that sticking up a candle in the centre of the ocean was rather a hope-
less experiment. It was convenient as long as it lasted to light the
Sun to his watery bed, but BoREAs was in such an obstreperous state all
last week, that the fatal blow has been at last given, and -the-Light of
all Nations has been puffed out, after a flicker of several months in its
sinking socket. Everything that skill could do to rescue the light
from its fate was resorted to, and a save-all had been even suggested
to keep its head above water. It has, however, been all in vain ; the
Light of all Nations has taken its place with the various lights of other
days, and has gone to the common extinguisher.

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL, ToM Thumb.
The GENERAL DEPARTS FOR THE EGYPTIAN HALL.-GREAT
Public MANIFESTATION BY THE POPULACE,
ND now, Lord Mayor,” ses I—havin
finished my chop, and takin no manner
of notice of the Bank note that that
critter, ALDERMAN GIBBs, would still
be a smackin his lips and lookin at—
“And now, Lord Mayor, as I feel a
little the true Cheshire, we'll jest go to
'Gyptian Hall, and you shall have the
honour to 'scort me. "Tainte every day,”
ses I, “the City of London has sich
luck.”
“'Tainte,” ses Lord Mayor ; and then
he begins to go back'ards out o' the
room, a bowin and a bowin afore me,
like a pigeon pickin up peas.
“Mind the stairs, Lord Mayor,” ses I,
“or you will find yourself a standin on
your head on the door-mat.” BARNUM
put on his cloak. “BARNUM,” ses I,
“are you ready ?” “Ready,” ses BAR-
NUM : whereupon, I jumps upon a chair,
and then jumps from it, sitting a stroddle
on BARNUM's right hip, and holdin the
Guv'ner by the buttons; and then he
put his cloak round me, and walked
down stairs, and nobody, to have looked at BARNUM, would have
thought there was the least mite particular about him ; never thinkin
there was the greatest wonder upon airth sittin a stroddle on his
leg. And in this way, BARNUM always takes me in and out of the
coach, that the critters in the street mayn't be for a minute on the
free list, and see me without the shillin.
Well, the door was opened, and the Mayor and the Aldermen got into
their carriages and wheeled off, and the men in armour began to trot,
and the brass band to play “See, the Conquerin Hero comes 1 "-it's
always played to me and WellingtoN-and the people hooraed as if
they'd tear a hole in the sky above 'em. Then they began to screach
for ToM THUMB. “Where's the Gen'ral 2 " they cried, “The Gen'ral
—the Gen'ral ' " for they never seed me get in the charot. “The
Gen'ral ” cried the men—and the women, the dear critters, I could
hear their voices, like the ringin of so many dollars, cryin out,
“Where's the Darlin’?” “the Duck?” “the Cherub º' “the Angel?"
“the airthly Bird of Paradise ?” and I don't know what beside. For
this is clear, I'd turned all the critters' heads afore they'd seen me;
and after they'd seen me agin and agin, and kissed and kissed me, till
my cheeks was wastin away like a cake of Windsor soap, their heads
had another twist, and are goin on turnin and turnin at this present
moment. How BARNUM did larf l—I felt the critter grinnin in his
very pockets as he heard the mob-and didn't I punch him with both
my fists, and larf too ! At last, there was sich a noise, and the bells
did ring so, I wanted to look about me.
“It’s impossible, Gen'ral "–ses BARNUM. “’t would spile all.
Don't you know, Gen'ral, what an unprincipled critter the public is.
If I was only to show the leetlest piece on airth of you, they’d fancy
the rest, and keep the shillins as close as oysters.”
“Well, then, tell me all about it. Is there many o' the critters ?”
ses I.
“Many ſ” cries BARNUM. “I should say—and Gen'ral, I never
'xaggerate; tainte my hook, by no means—but I should say, on a
rough guess, a leetle above a million.”
“And a million shillins,” ses I– -
“Never mind,” ses BARNUM : “I know all about that better than
you, Gen'ral. Well, this is a mighty fine sight, to be sure. All the
people with their holiday clothes on—all at the winders, and on the
roofs of the houses—and some of the gals with your pictur, Gen'ral,
from the Ulcerated News, pinned jest over their hearts.”
“The pretty pussy critters,” ses I.
“And Gen'ral,” ses BARNUM, “don’t you smell nothin, kinder
scent 7” ses he. -
“Nothin,” ses I; and I didn't. -
“Well, you ought: for they're throwin flowers from all the winders
—and—there—I’m a varmint if there isn't one lady in a squirrel
tippet that's jest emptied a bottle of lavender—don't you smell it—
on the roof of the coach. A great day, Gen'ral, this for Columbia,”
ses BARNUM ; and agin I felt his pocket beat and throb as if it was
alive. “Well, this is as it should be. How d'ye do, EveRETT 2
Yes, Gen'ral, there's our ambassador jest turned out of Bond Street
in his full dress, on a piebald horse, bearin the star-spangled banner,
and carryin a goolden eagle in his hat. Well, this is only payin his
countrymen proper respect. He won't lose nothin by it, at Washington.
He's a good critter, after all, that EveRETT.”
“BARNUM,” ses I, “what d'ye think? I’ve a thought. Suppose
we was to ax EveRETT as the 'Bassador of the United States, jest for
the first day, to give us a kinder glory-like, to take the shillins 7”
“Gen'ral,” ses. BARNUM, “Ambassadors and politicians are good
enough critters in their way ; but never mix 'em up with your
private shillins. Tainte the true grit, nohow. There ! Do you
hear that ?”
“Why, they're firin the guns :" ses I; “yes, I can smell the
powder.”
“The Park and the Tower ninety-eight-pounders, I can tell 'em to an
ounce,” ses BARNUM ; “mighty civil of Gracious Majesty to have 'em
fired ; they don’t do no mºre when she opens the Parliament—the
Grand National Caucus. And now, Gen'ral, we're a-going to stop—
for here's 'Gyptian Hall.” Well, I might ha' known that by the
screechin and hollorin of the people. And all the bells rung louder
and louder—and the guns went on a-bangin—and the trumpets a-
screaming, and in the middle of the shindy, BARNUM steps out of the
coach, and, with me still gripping him about the leg, and entirely
kivered by the cloak, enters the 'Gyptian Hall. I felt him a-goin
up a lot of stairs, and, at last, he went into a room. “Gen'ral,” ses
he, “you're welcome to home;” whereupon I climbs down his leg to
the floor, and looked about me. The room was large and—what I
special like in a room—was very high. “Yes, Gen'ral, this is what
we may call our mint ; here we'll strike a million or so of dollars out
of the enlightened British public that is so humble of itself, it can't
find nothin to run after at home ; and so likes to have genius, like
pine-apples, of foreign growth.”
“Are we all alone in the Hall ?” ses I.
“No,” ses BARNUM, “there's a poor critter that has made an Apollo
in marble, and a HEBE, and a VENUs, and half-a-dozen Graces, and
things of that sort. All day yesterday—for I made inquiry special—
there was only three people came to see the lot, and one o' them was
a baby in arms.”
“If you please, sir,” ses BARNUM's man, comin in, “if you please,
sir, is the Gen'ral ready ? There'll be murder if you don't open the
doors ; there's sich a crowd Three ladies have been carried out
faintin, and I’ve left two jist going into asterisks 1"
When BARNUM heerd this he larfed, and rubbed his hands, and
stroddled up and down the room, and put his hands in his pocket, and
took 'em out, and rubbed 'em again. Then he stopt and drawed
himself up, and said solemn-like to his man : “A crowd of ladies, eh?
I tell you what, you must let 'em wait till they rise to bilin pint, and
then—when I give the word—let 'em bust in.”
PUNCH BALLOONS.
HAVING resolved upon an enormous circulation of Punch throughout
the whole of the Continent, for the better civilisation, or, what is the
same thing, the Punchillization of our fellow-men, we have taken
counsel of Doctor REID, for the purpose of making the most of “every
little air that under heaven is blown ; ” and we have resolved to defy
the despotism that would ban Punch, by obtaining a circulation through
the means of balloons. Doctor REID advises us as follows:–
He says, “Manufacture a verythin oiled tissue paper, or a verythin
fabric of India-rubber, like gold-beater's skin—either of which, if made
in quantity, can be produced at an inconceivably small expense. Of this
fabric form very small balloons, which inflate with gas in the usual
way, attaching to each as many Numbers of Punch as it will bear—
which number will be considerable, since it is the spirit of Punch, as
MR. Milton says, to “spring upward like a pyramid of flame.’ Send
the balloons up when the wind blows easterly. To make the balloon
descend at the right time, a little water should be poured into each ;
which would drop through a minute orifice ; and the water, when all
gone, would allow the gas to escape, and the balloon and its bundle of
Punches descend; falling like honey-dew upon the fields of France,
Prussia, Austria, Russia, and perhaps China and Crim Tartary 1 "
The effect of this literary aerostation upon benighted millions is, if we
may be allowed a novel and beautiful phrase, more easily conceived
than described |

O'Connell's ºbjection3 to the 33 epeal of the Simion.
Nobody, a year or two ago, would have dreamed that O'Connell
would ever object to the Repeal of the Union. We now, however, are
strongly inclined to think that he will, as there is every prospect of a
speedy cessation of Rent; in which case we confidently predict that
he will see no good in the continuance of the Repeal agitation. We
even anticipate that MR. O'Connell will have the following objections
to Repeal:—
1. That circumstances alter cases, and that the Whigs are no longer
“base, bloody, and brutal,” but, on the contrary, generous, pacific, and
considerate; also, that the Sassenach have ceased to be tyrants and
oppressors, and instead of causing poor old Ireland to bleed, have bled
themselves, like perfect pelicans, for the benefit of the said poor old
Ireland.
2. That the principle of “Ireland for the Irish” must be given up ;
because it would involve that of “Ireland without the English,” with-
º * experience has proved that Ireland is unable to get on at
all, at all.
3. That, upon mature consideration, it appears too true, that, if
Ireland, at a pinch, wanted a dirty fifteen millions, there is not a soul
on.ºth but John BULL of whom she could beg or borrow the small
trifle.
4. That the Union is now to be regarded in a new light entirely;
namely, in that of a partnership, in which Ireland is the sleeping
partner, and England does the business and pays all the expenses,
which is a mighty easy and comfortable arrangement.
5. That Repeal had better not be talked about any longer, because
the mention of it rakes up old scores; particularly one with a certain
gentleman, who, some years ago, ventured to pledge his head that it
should be carried within six months.
“How Happy the soldier 1"
In the Chronicle there is a paragraph from a Correspondent, from
which we learn that the Duke's fifty lashes have been inflicted on a
man, named BLAKELEY, for deserting with half-a-sovereign. The
paragraph continues:–
“When in confinement in Fort Pitt, Chatham, he put lime into his eyes, with the
object of º them to such an extent as to render him unfit for service, and it was
for that crime that he was corporally punished to-day.”
Military Glory must, in sooth, be a hideous hag, when a poor wretch
puts lime in his eyes, that he may not look at her.

OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
THE Morning Chronicle has alluded to
the precarious state of the Foreign
Relations of Punch. We never like, at
º, any time, talking about ourselves ; but
ſº in this instance do not mind breaking
through our usual reserve, to furnish our
talented contemporary with the follow-
ing authentic particulars :-
The Ports in France are closed against
the admission of Punch. A private copy,
however, is always sent over to the
Tuileries, which Louis-PHILIPPE reads
under the bed-clothes, the last thing at
night, for fear of any one seeing him. It
is a curious fact, that King's messengers
are always sent off the first thing the
following morning to the War Office, to
complete the fortifications of Paris, as
rapidly as possible. The watchword of
the Army is—“Mort au Punch.”
The whole of Prussia is blockaded against the entry of Punch. The
police have the strictest orders to take any one into custody who at-
tempts to smuggle in a copy. Every cheese, every little atom is
sounded—every cocoa-nut examined—every bottle vised, to see if they
contain any symptoms of Punch. The most important article of the
Prussian Constitution will be (when it is published) —“It is high
treason to read Punch.”
The Emperor of Russia has issued an Ukase in which it is forbidden
to mention the name of Punch, under the penalty of ten years' exile in
Siberia. A translation of every Number is laid every week before his
Imperial Majesty; and whenever he is unusually cross, or indulges
more than his wont, in edicts and confiscations, the servants of the
Palace say to one another, “Look out ! The Emperor has been
reading Punch to-day :" and the bold st Cossack trembles.
Punch enjoys the advantages of Free Trade in China ; and the
Emperor, in his characteristic way, calls it “The Congou of Fun, and
the Pekoe of Wit,” and has written under innumerable copies, with
his own celestial hand, “Strongly recommended for family use.”
Ann-El-KADER is a regular subscriber to Punch, and always carries
a copy about his person as a talisman against the “Sons of dogs,”
which it seems is the Oriental phrase for Frenchmen. Mehr MET ALI,
ever since the bill of Punch was “stuck” by one of our bold staff
upon the Pyramid, has graciously allowed a guard of forty sentries to
be constantly stationed on the summit of that stupendous building, to
look after it. Whenever he reads it, the descendant of the Prophet
strokes his beard, and exclaims—“ALLAH be praised I Who'd have
thought it 7"
Africa and Asia are large consumers of Punch, ships of large tonnage
trading there, being freighted frequently with no other merchandise ;
and Aumerica shows its admiration of Punch, in the same way that it
does of the best English works, by reprinting it. It is not unusual to
see two members of Congress fighting, like two Kilkenny cats, for the
possession of an early copy.
Punch circulates all over the world. A copy was lately, found,
entwined round the British Flag, at the top of the North Pole, and
Mus, CAuple was spoken with last summer, in Behring's Straits.
Wherever Punch is to be seen, there is freedom and joy, wherever
he is excluded, there is tyranny and gloom. The emigrant cannot have
a better guide, in fixing his residence in a country, than in ascertaining
first, whether Punch is admitted.
Such is a condensed summary of the present state of our Foreign
Relations.
$3ab amb Goob Orangts.
At a recent inquest in St. Giles's, MR. WARLEY told the jury that
| he had discovered a manufactory of Oranges, at which bad oranges
could be made to put on the face of good ones.
“The process º was the submitting of unripe and inferior oranges to the action
of steam, or par-boiling them. This made them swell, filled out their rinds, and made
them thin, the usual external sign that the fruit was To give them the last polish,
and heishten their outward attraction, they were rubbed with a greasy piece of flannel,
or with somethius more objectionable.”
Well, it is not generally known that this process was first discovered
by the KuNg of HANoven, when Duke of Cumberland. All the world
recollects the talk about the bad Oranges in Ireland, his Royal High-
ness being thought the sourest and most unwholesome Orange of the lot.
Whereupon, in his place in the Lords, (assisted by an Orange from
the same tree, Lond Ron EN,) the Duke submitted the Oranges to cer-
tain warm and steaming speeches, endeavouring to make them swell
into Oranges of a respectable appearance; and, then, to give them "the
last polish,” did he not, as we may say, take his robe of royal purple,
(having “nothing more objectionable”) and rub and rub his brother
Oranges, to pass them off on the world as most delectable and wholesome
fruit—especially from Ireland It is strange that MR. WAKLEY, with
his proverbial sagacity, did not see, in the trick of St. Giles, only an
imitation of a parliamentary trick of St. James 1
THE SHUTTLECOCK PAUPER.
HE was old and thin, so that, under the skin,
You could count his pauper bones,
And, like whipcord strands, curled the veins of his hands,
As he sat there, breaking stones ;
And his song went along with the clink of his hammer—
An old tale of wrong, told in very bad grammar—
“I’m fourscore to-morrow ; in sin I was born,
Baptised into sorrow, and christened to scorn.
With a curse and a buffet, a hard father's door
Left my mother; to rough it—her baby she bore ;
And still from that birth-day, despite heart or hand,
I bear ‘vagrant’ upon me, stamped deep like a brand.
So right, boys, or wrong, young or old, sick or strong,
I'm only a “casual :’ pass me along !
“The story-books tell of the Wandering Jew
I know, mighty well, that the story is true;
'Tis all for to put poor folks on their mettle meant,
And shows 'em what comes of not having a settlement.
So right, boys, or wrong, young or old, sick or strong,
I'm only a “casual :' pass me along !
“Here I’ve lived by hard labour, man and boy, forty years ;
But “love of their neighbour” don't bind overseers,
All in vain—with my toil of spade, scythe, pick and plough-
I've water'd the soil with the sweat of my brow.
But right, boys, or wrong, young or old, sick or strong,
I'm only a “casual :' pass me along !
“In this parish I married, as the church books can show,
Here my old dame I carried to the churchyard below ;
Here my children were reared, here my children have died,
And fain, if you'd let me, I'd sleep by their side.
But, right, boys, or wrong, young or old, sick or strong,
I'm only a “casual : * pass me along !
“Game ne'er made me poacher, want ne'er made me thief;
Still, I'm an encroacher—no right to relief;
I can't die where I like, I must live where I can,—
What's a vagrant to do with the heart of a man 7
So, right, boys, or wrong, young or old, sick or strong,
I'm only a “casual :' pass me along !
“In England and Wales, if you search 'em all o'er,
There's of parishes some fourteenthopsand or more;
They'll not help me to live in e'er one of the lot,
And a corner to die in is hard to be got.
But, right, boys, or wrong, young or old, sick or strong,
I'm only a “casual :' pass me along !”
HOW TO READ THE DEBATES.
As it is really a day's labour to read the Debates—and it is a luxury
which only gentlemen possessing £1000 a year can afford—we advise
persons who wish to acquire some knowledge of the legislature of their
glance over the “hears” and the “cheers,” which are interspersed,
like so many glow-worms, along the dark, interminable lanes of type.
The “laughs” also are worth stopping in one's dreary journey to
listen to, and an “Order from the Speaker” may also justify a mo-
mentary stoppage ; but when there is nothing but a gloomy expanse of
level, unbroken, barren-looking print before the reader, we recommend
him to run over it as fast as he can, not to make a single stop, but to
jump over each member's style in the most expeditious manner. The
oases in the Grand Parliamentary Desert—all the rest is dust, dust,
dust, nothing but dust, which would blind in time the strongest pair of
eyes, and lay up the most indefatigable reader. By pursuing this
line of march, the bold traveller, who intends running through the
Arabia Petraea of Debates, will get to the end of his day's journey in
himself. With a feeling of the truest benevolence we wish him a happy
Journey.

A GOOD IDEA.
AMong the petitions presented to the House of Commons, on Thursday
evening, was one by MR. WAKLEY, from a gentleman in' debt, who, out
of a conscientious regard to the interests of his creditors, had applied
to Parliament to lend him the money to settle with all of them. A
desire to pay one's debts is so exceedingly laudable, that we hope the
gentleman who has had the manliness to avow his embarrassments,
| will not be thwarted in his noble project of paying twenty shillings in
the pound, by any ill-judged parsimony on the part of the Legislature.
The debtor confesses he has taken the idea from the great piece of
statesmanship lately propounded by Lord JoHN RUssell, as Prime
Minister, in accordance with which Government is to lend, or give,
which are often convertible terms, the money to pay the debts of the
Irish landlords. It is delightful to see a private individual coming
forward in a spirit of fine morality, and offering to pay his own debts
on the same terms as those which are suggested to an entire nation by
high ministerial authority. “Out of debt out of danger,” is an
admirable motto ; and as Ireland is to be put out of danger by being
got out of debt, we trust that Mr. WARLEY's embarrassed petitioner
will reap the fruits of his own honesty by the aid which—his being a
parallel case to that of Ireland—he is fairly entitled to. What is true
of the whole is true of a part, and what is good policy with regard to a
whole community, must be good policy with regard to one of its
members. The prayer of the gentleman's petition seems to be so
reasonable, when we look at the policy Ministers have adopted with
regard to Ireland, that we sincerely wish he may get it.
PUNCH*S HISTORICAL PORTRAIT GALLERY.
FREDERICK THE GREAT.
THIs distinguised monarch is identified, in the popular mind, with
war, jack-boots, high shoulders, snuff taken in immense quantities
from the waistcoat pocket, and Voltai RE. His career is remarkable
for the seven years' war, which is popularly confounded with the thirty
ź. ditto, but should, we need not say, be carefully distinguished
rom it.
FREDERICK was well known for his military sternness and brevity,
which have made him a favourite on the stage and off. His amuse-
ment, while in camp, was to order out the candles at ridiculously
early hours, and then to prowl about, detecting those who neglected to
“dowse their glims,” and immediately putting them to death.
His connexion with VoltaïRE redounds very little to the credit of
- ---
either. He was in the barbarous habit of requesting the philosopher
to review his works, and putting him in prison if he expressed an un-
favourable opinion. Had His Majesty been lucky enough to possess a
Quarterly Review in his dominions, he would have been spared this
harsh alternative. Voltair E on one occasion remarked that FREDE-
RICK might be a great king, but was certainly a small poet, for which
cutting sarcasm his pension was stopped and himself confined for
several years in the fortress of Glatz, where he made the acquaintance
of the well-known. BARON TRENck, and wrote his celebrated epic, the
“Pucelle de Belleville,” on the outside of a pewter pot, with a rusty nail.
* FREDERICK set out in life with that determination to make his way,
which has always marked the character of great conquerors and cele-
brated highwaymen. He found Prussia 2190 German miles in extent,
and left it 3515, with seventy millions of dollars in the treasury, and an
army of 200,000 men to keep off the owners, in case they claimed their
property. All this was the fruit of the most unblushing spoliation,
conducted on that large scale which entitles royal practitioners to the
title of Great, while'smaller depredators seldom rise, except to the gallows.
He did not, however, promise his subjects a Constitution. He contented
himself with being the TURPIN of the house of Brandenburg, leaving
to his present Majesty the character of its “RoberT MACAIRE,” which
he now alternates with that of its “TARTUFFE,” in a style quite un-
paralleled.
ADDRESS OF CONDOLENCE TO PRINCE ALBERT.
Mr. Punch, his bosom happening to be fired with loyalty, begs to
move that the following Address of Condolence be presented by his
numerous readers to PRINCE ALBERT :—
May it please your Royal Highness :-We, the undersigned, readers
of Punch, and constituting a large majority of the people of your
Gracious Consort, beg to approach your arm-chair—they lament that
they are as yet unable to say throne—with feelings of condolence and
sympathy.
We never, except in case of necessity, omit that portion of our duties
as subjects, which consists in daily reading the Court Oircular, and
making ourselves duly acquainted with all the movements and pro-
ceedings of our illustrious Sovereign, yourself, and your august family.
From the first of last September until recently, we hardly remember
to have perused a single Court Circular in which we did not find it
related that #. Royal Highness, in the morning, had, for several
hours, enjoyed the diversion of shooting. We were thus made sensible
of the high gratification derived by your Royal Highness from that
amusement, and of the strong attachment of your Royal Highness to
your princely gun. We are hence enabled to sympathise with your
Royal Highness in what we conceive must be your Royal feelings
during the present suspension of sport.
We therefore humbly venture to condole with your Royal Highness
on the termination of the shooting season, which occurred on the first
of this month ; and respectfully to express the hope that you will find
some other amusement, which will be a resource and consolation to you
between this time and the first of September next.
THE “STABLE MIND” ON CRACOW.
ON the first night of the Session Lord GEorge BENTINCK—with all
the coolness of TATTERSALL's—assured the House that the people of
Cracow were delighted at the annexation of the city. The Austrian
Eagle was, in fact, quite a pet with them ; in witness thereof they
illuminated. Liberty was extinguished, and they lighted candles in
gratitude therefore. And now, what says the last protest of Load
GEoRGE's delighted citizens of Cracow 7
“The inhabitants received notice that they were not to quit their houses, that doors
and windows were to be kept closed, that the patroles were ordered to fire on any one
who might come out at a door, or look out at a window, and that all the windows were
to be lighted throughout the night. This last was an effectual precaution for preventing
the inhabitants from moving about, or peeping furtively into the streets.”
And by windows so lighted, Lord STABLEMIND reads the huge
content of an outraged people ! Now, had the city been burnt to ashes,
his Lordship would, doubtless, have eulogised the conflagration as a
bonfire kindled to show far and wide the extreme felicity of the
houseless 1
The Prattle of Parliament.
THE House of Commons is “at it again;”—at its old trick of talking
to no purpose. Lord GeoRGE BENTINCR brings forward an Irish
Railway Bill, which he well knows will never pass ; Lord John
Russell declares that he shall oppose it, and yet allows it to be dis
cussed. “Time,” says the adage, “is money;” of which Parliament is
giving too much away to have any left to waste. We hope that the
legend of “Tempus Fugit” will be conspicuously printed up in the
new House of Commons,

THE LIVERY OF PARLIAMENT.
WE are not great admirers of the hat-band, shoulder-knot, and
plush, when worn by footmen; and certainly not when donned by
Members of Parliament—for some wear a livery, only, as Ophelia says,
“with a difference.” We repeat it ; we do not think that even a
JEAMEs should be taken by the aristocracy—whether of gules or
bullion—and ſantastically drest, even as a little girl dresses her doll, in
yellow, red, pink, purple, like a human tulip; nevertheless, it will take
some time, no doubt, ere human vanity consents to have its servants
out of livery. But surely, with the Reform Bill, we ought no longer to
have Members of Parliament drest like lacqueys. The last victim is
the Honourable Footman for West Sussex, Richard PRIME, Esq ;
in more holiday phrase, the nominee of the DUKE of RichMond. What
said the honest “MR. A. H. Cox, of Brighton 7". Why, he “protested
against the farce being called an election for West Sussex. For,” he
continued—
“There was the Duke or Richmond and the Duke or Nonroix, and two or three
more, who, if they liked, could choose their own footmen as their representatives (cheers
and counter cheers). The electors on this occasion had not the slightest power of pre-
venting the election of Mn. PRIME [“True"]. * * * He repeated it was slavery to
the tenants, and he defied any one to say that the Duke of Richmond's tenants dare
vote against the Duke's nominee (MR. Rushaidaek). [Duke's agent, “It is false; "
cries of “True, true."]."
Most true; and upon this truth, Richard PRIME, Esq. was elected
Member for West Sussex; that is, he put on the Duke's livery. Yes;
Truth, with her clear starlight eyes, sees PRIME, upon the hustings,
endue his nether self with the Richmond plush, don the coloured coat,
with its motley collar and facings, and stuck all over with the Rich-
Mond buttons, and then PRIME putteth on the hat with the Richmond
---
band, and he is all over covered with the Richmond livery; only with
this difference—the Duke's footman wears it upon his outward man,
and the Duke's Member wears the livery upon his soul. The Duke's
motto is En la Rose jejleurie; which PRIME, as a member of Parliament,
thus freely translates—Under the Duke I flourish/
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.
“DEAR PUNCH,
- “I should like to know how you came by the information
respecting my domestic inconveniences, which you published in your
last Number, I suspect you must have been mesmerised, and have
become a clairvoyant. You allude to the unsatisfactory composition of
the peas pudding which was lately served up to me with some under-
done pork; but you unaccountably omit the more important fact, that
for a long time I have never met with a cabinet pudding to my taste.
It seems that you and I. or rather I and you, were mistaken with
respect to the attempt at the Sunday-olosing of the soup-kitchens at
Liverpool. The truth is, that I was hoaxed by one of those corres-
pondents, who, as I complained in the Lords, are always pestering me
with their letters. I am sorry that I misled you; but still you were
to blame in too readily relying on my ipse dirit. Are you not aware
that you must not mind everything that I say ?
“Your friend and admirer,
“BRougilAM AND WAUx.”
*...* We publish the foregoing without note or comment. If it is not
a forgery, we shall be highly delighted to see the noble writer's pot-
hooks again.

In Smithfield, on a market day,
And 'tis Oh I the lives that are weekly lost ;
An ox went mad and ran away :
Sing, How would you like to be gored and toss'd 2
In Smithfield this was nothing rare,
What did the Corporation care 2
Pooh-pooh it was not their affair :
Let us wait till we find a thing out to our cost.
This rabid ox rush'd right and left,
And 'tis Oh the lives that are weekly lost;
And through the crowd his passage cleft :
Sing, How would you like to be gored and toss'd 7
Up Newgate-street he fiercely ran,
And met, right plump, no other than
An influential Alderman:
Let us wait till we find a thing out to our cost.
His hapless worship prostrate roll’d,
And 'tis Oh the lives that are weekly lost ;
The rest's too horrid to be told .
Sing, How would you like to be gored and toss'd 7
The Corporation met, next day;
And in a trice, without delay,
With Smithfield market did away:
For at last they had found a thing out to their cost.

Louis-PHILIPPE has been nicely tricked about the dowry of the
Infanta of Spain. He expected to receive 30,000,000 francs, whereas
he has only pocketed 30,000,000 reals; which makes, it seems, a dif-
ference of nearly two-thirds less in the calculation. This will teach
his Royal Majesty not to count his pecuniary chicks for the future
previous to the “shelling out.” We feel so acutely for His French
Majesty, that we do not mind, for his sake, risking the paltry pun, and
calling his disappointment “A Case of Real Distress.”
THE THISTLEWOOD TALENT.
THE Post is in a frightful rage with John BRIGHT. Listen :—
“MR. John BRight pronounced an oration. It was in his usual style of coarse,
offensive, extravagant Radicalism-something like the impudence of the members of the
old. Thistlewood gang, without their talent.”
Their “talent,” we believe, was to provide a bag for the head of Lord
QastLEREAGH, and to murder a police-officer | And the Post speaks
this savage truth of John BRIGHT. He is “without their talent.”

THE PROSPECTS OF LEICESTER SQUARE.
Pooh Leicester Square It is locked up in Chancery, which may
account for there never being anybody now in the interior. The fear,
we suppose, of being kept there for life strikes awe into the most vaga-
bond boys, and prevents the most spirited beadle from venturing inside.
We always thought there was an atmosphere of Chancery about the
dreary place. The poor thistles look sucked dry, and hang their heads
in very shame for their depressed condition. The small remnant of grass
is in the last stage of seediness, and sadly wants some revivor or other
to restore its natural colour. The weeds are smoke-dried, and, being
arrayed in the deepest black, seem to be in mourning for their miser-
able lot—pining away in solitude for the loss of that husbandry from
which they have been so long widowed. The beds have not been made
for the last twelvemonth—and look terribly damp—the trees want a
good shaking—the shrubs are dirty, and certainly require being turned,
or changed, or aired, and the forlorn statue of GeoRGE THE FIRst,
who dozes in the middle of this immense four-poster, is an illustra-
tion, “done upon stone,” of SHARspere's beautiful saying, that—
“Misery, or Chancery, (it is all the same) makes a man acquainted with
strange bedfellows.” It would be the act of a true philanthropist to
give him a new bolstering, or else provide him with a new berth.
But supposing His Majesty is passed on to a new parish, the question
is, what can be done with his late home 2 There is a talk of turning
it into a circus, and making it the West Riding of London. There is
also a whisper, which we picked up in the gallery of St. Paul's (price
twopence, bishops gratis), of MADAME TUssaud buying it for the pur-
pose of airing her wax figures during the summer; but this again is
contradicted by a general murmur that JULLIEN intends to make it the
arena for his monster ophecleides and drums, and that he will inaugurate
the opening, in June, with a new set of quadrilles, called the Smithfield
Market Quadrilles, in which will be introduced, in the Pastorale, imita-
tions of 500 animals, with a new set of French horns. The most preva-
lent rumour, however, is that it will be kept in its present state for the
Christmas Cattle Shows, as it has been calculated that there will be a
saving of fodder on account of the abundant pasturage ; but we are
afraid that Durhams and Southdowns will turn up their noses at
thistles, and feel themselves painfully stung with nettles after having
been fed with the richest cake, and having lived all their lives over
head and ears in clover. But we think all these rumours, whispers,
murmurs, and reports, are dreadfully premature, for if the Square is in
Chancery, it will be time enough, fifty years hence, for persons to be
speculating what to do with it.
The Prussian Constitution.
Ir was asserted by the Augsburgh Gazette, that the day on which the
Prussian Constitution would make its appearance would be the 24th
instant, the anniversary of FREDERICK THE GREAT's birthday. Of
course this statement has turned out to be fudge. We are authorised
to announce that the day that has been fixed upon by the KING of
PRUssíA, on which to confer a Constitution on his subjects, is the 80th
of February.

THE PAST.
VAST is the difference between the Poets' Patron of the past and of
the present period. Formerly the noble was the encourager of the lofty
strains of inspiration, but now-a-days Moses is the MAEcENAs of the
Muses. In times gone by the bard was accustomed to write lays to
laud the lazy lordling, but now he sings paeans to the paletot, and
invests the vest with the graceful trimmings of fancy.
The poet has turned puffer instead of parasite. Should another
Pope arise, he would sing the praises of another Chesterfield ; but
instead of being the Earl of that name, it would be the wrapper he
would take for the subject of his lucubrations. The following is a
fair specimen of the style of thing to which a new Pope would most
probably devote his poetical talents :-

How happy is the new Mosaic cut !
When Moses opens, let the rest be shut.
Look at the coat so dashing, yet refined,
In front perfection, and the same behind;
Body and skirt their equal distance keep,
The collar not too narrow, nor too deep ;
Grace shines about it with enchanting beams,
And finest workmanship cements the seams.
Taste lurks in every fold, and—Gracious Heaven l

Slave-Holding America.
We learn from the papers that that nest of singing birds, the
HUTCIIINson family, were not permitted to carol, because they would
not bind themselves not to execute anti-slavery songs. They bowed
to the despotism of the republican slave-holders, and were silent. We
understand that certain American authorities, with whom coloured
flesh is especially dear, inasmuch as they make dollars by it, propose
to enact a law for the destruction of all small birds at liberty; it
being considered dangerous to the interests of slavery, that even
innets and goldfinches should sing, if not in cages.
THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
CHAPTER L.-CLUB SNOBS.
The misfortune which befel the simple and good-natured young
SACKville, arose entirely from that abominable Sarcophagus Club ;
and that he ever entered it was partly the fault of the present
writer.
For seeing MRs. CHUFF, his mother-in-law, had a taste for the
genteel—(indeed, her talk was all about LoRD Collingwood, Lord
GAMBIER, SIR JAHALEEL BRENTon, and the Gosport and Plymouth
balls)—WAGLEY and I, according to our wont, trumped her conver-
sation, and talked about Lords, Dukes, Marquises, and Baronets, as if
those dignitaries were our familiar friends.
“LoRD SExton BURY,” says I, “seems to have recovered her Lady-
ship's death. He and the Duke were very jolly over their wine at the
Sarcophagus last night; weren't they, WAGLEY 7"
“Good fellow, the Duke,” WAGLEY replied. “Pray Ma'am (to
MRs. CHUFF), you who know the world and etiquette, will you tell me
what ought a man to do in my case ? Last June, His Grace, his son
LoRD CASTLERAMPANT, ToM SMITH, and myself were dining at the
Club, when I offered the odds against Daddylonglegs for the Derby—
forty to one, in sovereigns only. His Grace took the bet, and of
course I won. He has never paid me. Now, can I ask such a great
man for a sovereign 7–0ne more lump of sugar, if you please, my
dear Madam.”
It was lucky WAGLEY gave her this opportunity to elude the ques-
tion, for it prostrated the whole worthy family among whom we
were. They telegraphed each other with wondering eyes. They
looked at us with mute surprise, like stout CoRTEz when he stared on
the Pacific. MRs. CHUFF's stories about the naval nobility grew quite
faint ; and kind little MRs. SACKVILLE became uneasy, and went up
stairs to look at the children—not at that young monster, NELson

Collingwood, who was sleeping off the whisky-and-water—but at has an Egyptian look; the drawing rooms are Louis QUAToRze (so called
a couple of little ones who had made their appearance at dessert, and
of whom she and SACKVILLE were the happy parents.
The end of this and subsequent meetings with MR. MAINE was,
that we proposed and got him elected as a member of the Sarcophagus
Club.
It was not done without a deal of opposition—the secret having
been whispered that the candidate was a coal-merchant. You may be
sure some of the proud people and most of the parvenus of the Club
were ready to black-ball him. We combated this opposition success.
fully, however. We pointed out to the parvenus that the LAMBTons
and the STUARTs sold coals : we mollified the proud by accounts of
his good birth, good nature and good behaviour; and WAGLEY went
about on the day of election, describing with great eloquence, the
action between the Pitchfork and the Furibonde, and the valour of
CAPTAIN MAINE, our friend's father. There was a slight mistake in
the narrative; but we carried our man; with only a trifling sprinkling
of black beans in the boxes: BYLEs's, of course, who black-balls
everybody; and BUNg's, who looks down upon a coal-merchant,
having himself lately retired from the wine-trade.
Some fortnight afterwards I saw SACKVILLE MAINE under the fol-
lowing circumstances —

because the hideous ornaments displayed were used in the time of
Louis QUINze); the cortile, or hall, is Morisco-Italian. It is all over
marble, maplewood, looking-glasses, arabesques, ormolu, and scagliola.
Scrolls, ciphers, dragons, Cupids, polyanthuses, and other flowers
writhe up the walls in every kind of cornucopiosity. Fancy every
gentleman in JULLIEN's band playing with all his might, and each
performing a different tune ; the ornaments at our Club, the Sarco-
phagus, so bewilder and affect me. Dazzled with emotions which I
cannot describe, and which she dared not reveal, MRs. CHUFF, followed
by her children and son-in-law, walked wondering amongst these
blundering splendours.
In the great library (225 feet long by 150) the only man Mrs.
CHUFF saw, was Tiggs. He was lying on a crimson velvet sofa,
reading a French novel of PAUL DE Kock. It was a very little book.
He is a very little man. In that enormous hall he looked like a mere
speck. As the ladies passed breathless and trembling in the vastness
of the magnificent solitude, he threw a knowing, killing glance at the
fair strangers, as much as to say, “Ain’t I a fine fellow 7" They
thought so, I am sure.
“Who is that 3" hisses out MRs. CHUFF, when we were about fifty
yards off him at the other end of the room.
“TIGGs 1” says I, in a similar whisper.
“Pretty comfortable this, isn't it, my dear?” says MAINE in a free
and easy way to MRS. SACKVILLE ; “all the magazines, you see—
writing materials—new works—choice library, containing every
work of importance—what have we here 7–"DUGDALE's Monasticon,”
a most valuable, and I believe, entertaining book.”
And proposing to take down one of the books for MRs. MAINE’s
inspection, he selected volume vii., to which he was attracted by the
singular fact, that a brass door-handle grew out of the back. Instead
of pulling out a book, however, he pulled open a cupboard, only
inhabited by a lazy housemaid's broom and duster, at which he
looked exceedingly discomfited—while NELson Collingwood, losing
all respect, burst into a roar of laughter.
“That's the rummest book I ever saw,” says NELson.
we’d no others at Merchant Tailors’.”
“Hush, NELson,” cries MRs. CHUFF, and we went into the other
magnificent apartments.
How they did admire the drawing-room hangings, (pink and silver
brocade, most excellent wear for London,) and calculated the price per
yard; and reveled on the luxurious sofas ; and gazed on the immea-
surable looking-glasses.
“Pretty well to shave by, eh?” says MAINE to his mother-in-law.
(He was getting more abominably conceited every minute) “Get
away, SACKv1LLE,” says she, quite delighted, and threw a glance over
her shoulder, and spread out the wings of the red tabinet, and took a
good look at herself; so did MRs. SACKVILLE-just one, and I thought
the glass reflected a very smiling, pretty creature.

as it is, is nothing in comparison to the splendour of the Sarcophagus.
The delighted SACKVILLE MAINE was pointing out the beauties of the
place to them. It seemed as beautiful as Paradise to that little
party.

up his collars and grinning at his own mottled face. HULKER looking
solemnly at his great person, and tightening his coat to give himself a
waist. FRED. MINCHIN simpering by as he is going out to dine, and
casting upon the reflection of his white neck-cloth a pleased moony
smile. What a deal of vanity that Club mirror has reflected, to be
sure :

rush for the evening papers ; they saw the kitchens–those wonders
of art—where the Chef was presiding over twenty pretty kitchen-
maids, and ten thousand shining saucepans ; and they got into the
light-blue fly perfectly bewildered with pleasure.
SACKville did not enter it, though little LAURA took the back seat
on purpose, and left him the front place alongside of MRs. CHUFF's
red tabinet.
“We have your favourite dinner,” says she, in a timid voice, “won't
you come, SACKVILLE *"
“I shall take a chop here to-day, my dear,” SACKVILLE replied.
“Home, JAMEs.” And he went up the steps of the Sarcophagus, and
the pretty face looked very sad out of the carriage, as the blue fly
drove away.

WE have heard it said of an individual of a shattered constitution,
that “so and so is an old man before he is a young one ;” and it really
seems as if the New Houses of Parliament would be Old Houses of
Parliament before they come to maturity. Reid and BARRY have
been at their quarrels again, and REID is declared by BARRY to be the
barrier to the completion of the building. It is beginning to be quite
evident, that if the present Parliamentary generation ever goes into
the new house, it will be when they are all octogenarians at least ; for
there is little chance of the completion of the buildings until we have
nearly run through the present century. DR. REID's ventilation is
the only regular ill wind that blows nobody good, and must be the
very gust alluded to in the proverb. He has dealt out upon poor
MR. BARRY what may be ºptly termed—
“A heavy blow and great discouragement.”
We can fancy the figures that will be cut by such of the existing
members of the legislature as may survive long enough to take their
seats in the New Houses of Parliament. Poor LoRD BROUGHAM, who
has been so anxious for the Lords to get a house, that he actually
had thoughts of proposing that the Peers should join the Mutual
Benefit Building Society, has been heard to sing the following quatrain—
“There's nae luck about the house, There's nought but ague in the house,
There's nae luck at a', Till Doctor: REID's awa!"
THE INDIAN MAIL.
ERCEiving that the newspapers are
spending their five and ten thousand a
year to get what is called an “Antici-
pation of the Indian Mail,” we have
some idea of running an express of our
own ; but we shall try the experiment,
in the first instance, on a small scale,
from one of the suburbs. We find, on
referring to the contents of the bi-
monthly budget from India, that it is
not the quality of the news, but its ar-
rival two days before it comes in its
regular course, that constitutes its
value. For example, we will give a fair
average specimen of an Indian Sum-
mary, to obtain which, eight-and-forty
hours in advance of the post, couriers
have been riding as rapidly and upon as
many horses as M. LEoNARD, in his
circuitous overland, or over-sawdust route, round the ring, at Astley's,
from St. Petersburgh. It is for information like the following that
half-a-dozen couriers post, steam, rail, and gallop their precious lives
out some twelve times a year, and for which the steam is kept up at
a cost of fifteen pounds a day all the year round, in the harbour of
Boulogne. Voici /
OUR SUMMARY.
“The Wuseer has been suffering from a slight cold, and has had
several sneezing fits, which, as his health is valuable, have vibrated
from the mountains of Cashmere to the gates of Kangra. Ghoolab has
had another attack of the mumps, which has, for the present, closed
his mouth ; but he must eventually have a voice in the settlement of
Indian questions. The Beloochees are tranquil, but the Ghilzies are
noisy, while the Booghtie tribes are neither one thing nor the other.
EMEAM-ood DEEN, the shaky Sheik, has had a mustard poultice on his
chest; but he is still thought to harbour all kinds of evil in his per-
fidious bosom. FAL has had two interviews with SAL, but nothing
resulted from either.
“In domestic matters of intelligence there is the usual amount of
interest. The ship Rollabout, from Madras, CAPTAIN Top HEAvy, had
sailed with MR. and MRs. Jones and servant, as well as CAPTAIN
CUDDY and a “generally useful' boy, as passengers. MRs. RANTIPole
and lady, with maid-of-all-work, were passengers in the Rifum-Tºfum,
from Calcutta, but not having the money to settle for their berths,
they were indignantly put ashore by the captain on the Hog's Back,
where they still continue. The Tooral-Looral, in crossing the line,
which had become a little tangled, got into a regular web, and could
only get out at the rate of half-a-knot an hour. At length a loophole
was found for escape, and the captain, giving three cheers for Old
England, two for himself, and a ‘little one in,’ steered his vessel
bravely through the dilemma.
“Among the Indian marriages we have to record that of LIEUTENANT
SMITH, of the Yellow Facings, to LAURA, eleventh daughter of
ADJUTANT FLAMBEAU of the Native Flareups. The bride received, as
her portion, her father's blessing, and one of his old epaulettes. The
happy couple started off to Bubblejee Beerabad, to pass the honeymoon.
A post-chaise and four elephants was in readiness to convey them as far
as the first stage, which is only seventeen hundred miles, after which
they intended palanquining it as far as Bobdul, when they would walk
the rest of the way to Bubblejee Beerabad.”
Such is an average synopsis of one of those tremendous “anticipa-
tions” which come over twice a month ſrom India. We think we
might get news almost as exciting, and far more economical, from
Brompton or Battersea. Here, for instance, is a specimen—
“BALD Bop, the beadle, remains at Don Salteros, in a state of hope-
less inebriety. SAM FLAM, the relieving officer, has refused his adhesion
to everything, and will listen to nothing. The shipping intelligence is
devoid of interest. The Bee left the pier with four passengers, but we
could not ascertain the name of any one of them. If we hear more we
shall say more at another opportunity.”
--
Punch and the Aldermen of London.
MR. ALDERMAN SIDNEY, at the Corporation Reform Meeting, ven-
tured to apply a little of his own gunpowder to Punch. Speaking of
the Aldermen, he said—“A little might be said in Punch derogatory
to them, but they had no hostile feeling directed against them.” [Crics
of “Oh Oh!”]. Again he said, “he believed there were scarcely an
Englishman to be found who wished ill to the Aldermen of London.”
Now Pwnch here with declares, that he does not wish ill to the Alder-
men; on the contrary, he wishes them much better.

JENRINs crowned the Count, he has been tremendously majestic ; and,

However, the last loyal effort of JENKINs was to concoct a song,
called “A Health / The Song of the Loyal Spaniards,”—(of course

A PLACE AT COURT.
WE know that a royal household requires a vast number of servants
and officers of different rank and degree, but the Middlesex Sessions
developed on Thursday last a most extraordinary and ambiguous
character, under the name of “the QUEEN's knacker.” An individual
aspiring to the honour of wearing the Windsor uniform as “HER
MAJEsty's knacker,” is a startling novelty in the constitution of a
repudiate a gentleman who has been engaged in the excitement of a
wager, that a certain dog of which he is proprietor would “worry” a
hundred rats in seven minutes.
The accomplishment of the feat was denied, and indeed we should
think it is almost impossible to judge when a rat is thrown into that
state of mental anxiety which amounts to “worry” in the opinion of
the best judges. We often say of ourselves, that “we are worried out
of cur lives,” though it is not literally the fact, and we think the rat
should have the benefit of the margin which is allowed to human beings.
But we are losing sight of our point, which is the singular claim set
up by an individual calling himself “the QUEEN’s knacker.” We
remember a person who used impudently to advertise himself as
“Bug-Destroyer to WILLIAM THE FourTH and all the Royal Family.”
No, no. We don't believe it. We could understand a Court
poet, a Court jester, or a Court fool ; but a Court knacker–Pooh 11
Incredible ! ! !
CROWNS FOR WOULD-BE KINGS.
WHEN Lucy Lockit sees Captain Macheath in chains—the lighter
ones, sold by her dear papa, who has them “from one guinea to ten "
—she vows there is nothing so touching as the sight of a great man
in distress. The Morning Post improves upon this sensibility. With
JENKINs, the smaller the hero, the greater his claims to loyalty and
sympathy. Hence, when JENKINs catches an exiled prince, he insists
upon crowning him, and calling him Majesty. On a recent occasion
Punch, as a faithful journalist, gave a brief account of the coronation
of the CoNDE MonTEMoLIN at the office of the Morning Post; whence
he issued, to the astonishment of at least the publisher, as the King of
the Two Spains. Full of his new dignity he rushed to the Haymarket
to astonish WEBsTER with his sudden majesty, and called for the
farce of The Village Lawyer (if we do not mistake—and we never do,)
conferred by the old coat of a true gentleman bought in Holywell
Street by a Jeremy Diddler.
Nevertheless, it is very good of JENKINs to dispose of large crowns
to little Princes as he does ; and, in furtherance of his benevolent
object, we understand that he proposes to have a variety of crowns
on hand, for those deposed, and for others, in the event of deposition ;
to be disposed of as worthy tradesmen put off hats. He will shortly
issue a bill, from which we make an extract :—

None at all, none at all, but his head he'll gravely shake,
And it's oh in my heart, that the fee he's sure to take.
THE CAT IN THE NAVY.
It is a vulgar and very prevalent error that there are moral humili-
ation and physical torture inflicted by the boatswain's cat ; whereas
the thong is never touched upon in Parliament but up rise admirals
and post-captains, who protest that the cat is little more than an
instrument imparting very lively sensations, and by no means unpopular
among sailors. A few nights ago, on the motion of MR. HuME for
flogging returns, great was the unanimity that prevailed among the
nautical Members of the House on the utility of the lash. “A harm-
less, necessary cat,” says Shylock, and so say the sailors of the House of
Commons. The officers again and again protest that flogging is not
—as a false humanity preaches—objectionable to sailors. “If that
shoe pinches your lordship,” says Foote's shoemaker, “may. I be
hanged 1" Upon the like principle do the men with epaulettes answer
for the feelings of foremast-men.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BROUGHAM’S POSES PLASTIQUES
We have had, during the last year or two, a variety of Professors
whose attainments have consisted of an aptitude for throwing them-
selves and others into all sorts of different attitudes. We have seen
| PRofessor Risley with his sons standing on the palm of their parent,
who gets his children off his hands in the most astonishing manner.
| We have witnessed entortilationists of every description, who have com .
bined the twistaboutitiveness of the eel, with the jumpupeightſeethigh-
ativeness of the antelope. We have heard of, though we have not
cared to see, the half-dozen VENUses who have been nightly rising
from the sea during the last six months in every quarter of the
metropolis.
But the greatest wonder of all in the pose plastique line are the mar-
vellous entortilations of HENRY Lond BRough AM. He has all the
elasticity of Indian-rubber, with more expression ; and the play of his
features, down to the very tip of his nose, is absolutely wonderful.
| The very best of the VENUses rising from the sea is nothing compared
with the Ex-Chancellor rising from the woolsack. CINCINNATUs tying
his sandal—by the bye, how was it he had it so frequently dangling
about his heels as to make his tying it a personal peculiarity by which
he is known to posterity ?—was a mere fool to BRough AM fastening
his high-low.
But the most astonishing part of the noble Lord's performances is
the series of attitudes into which he throws himself during a speech in
the House of Lords; for however brief the oration may be, he contrives
to illustrate it with a rapid succession of effective tableaua, as unique
as they are graceful. He not only suits the action to the word, when
he speaks himself; but while any one else is addressing the House,
Load Bhough AM finds for every word a suitable action: he is the
great pantomime peer, or, to use a legal expression, he is a tremendous
chose en action. The annexed Sketches, made on the spot by an accom-
plished artist, during a short speech made by LoRD STANLEY, will show
the rank his Lordship ought to hold as an entortilationist.
“LoRD St ANLEY entirely concurred in the observations of his noble
and learned friend, that this was a time of all others when public men
ought not to be subject to misrepresentation with regard to their
motives, and particularly when their motives and actions had reference
to public distress.” l
A FEW WORDS WITH JOHN BRIGHT.
John, thou art a sturdy, stalwart sort of man, speaking roundly out,
with something of a good English leaven in thee'; but thou art hot,
Johs, and thus riskest to be ungenerous and ignoble in thy speech on
the Short-time Bill. Punch would urge on thee, in kindness, certain
truths which thou hast forgotten.
Thou callest this a bill to control adult labour. It would limit the
working-hours of boys between thirteen and eighteen, and of women of
all ages, to something under twelve hours a day. Thou sayest that
when the work of the young stops, stops that of the grown man. If
mules and spindles are not tended, and threads pieced, the power-loom
must pause and the spinner stay idle. Does not this apply in the case of
children below thirteen 2 Might not the same argument have held to
keep them to their twelve, thirteen, and fifteen hours' daily toil, while
big men could be found willing to labour so long, and requiring the
children's aid 2
There is an alternative, John ; older people may be employed if
young ones cannot. Wages will not suffer for that, and wits will be all
the brighter for not simmering in the tropical heat of the mill, and faces
the ruddier, and lungs the sounder, for an hour's more fresh air to coun-
teract the cotton-fuz.
This Bill puts no absolute restraint on the labour of the strong man;
it but restrains that labour under its present circumstances; it gives
women some time to attend to their homes and families. All this,
John, thou unaccountably sayest nothing of Wages, wages, wages,
is thy cry... We do not think they will suffer; but if they did, there is
something besides money.
Thou wert never at school after fifteen Perhaps thou art none the
better for that, John. Thou tellest the House that in the establish-
ment with which thou art connected there is an infant school, a reading-
room, and a news-room, a school for adults after working-hours; and a
person specially employed, at a very considerable expense, who devotes
his whole time to the investigation of every case which can affect the
welfare of the working people, as a missionary among them ; and not a
few hundred pounds per annum are expended in promoting the advan-
tage of that body ºf workmen, wholly independent of any compulsion
by any act of the House.
Then thou goest on to warn the House, that if they arm the working
classes against the capitalists by a law fixing the maximum of labour
to ten or any other number of hours, it will be impossible that that feeling
should exist on the part of the manufacturers towards the working classes
which had hitherto eacisted.
Dost thou mean that, if the Bill passes, thou wilt do away with thy
infant schools, and adult schools, and reading-rooms, and missionaries 2
—that if Parliament infringe on what thou deemest thy rights thou wilt no
longer perform what certainly are thy duties John, John, this is
unworthy It is not on condition of working thy looms fourteen hours
a day that thou dost these things. It is that thou art an employer of
labour—and an intelligent one—and seest what belongs to thy station,
that thou providest thy workpeople with something beyond work
and wages.
We remember, when schoolboys, to have had a similar disposition.
If the master thwarted us, by admonition or punishment, we deter-
mined to be very bad boys, to write naughty words on our slate, to
deface our books, and rebel against our lessons.
Surely, John, thou art not going to threaten the House with similar
pranks, now-a-days * Bethink thee of this, John. Thou hast not, in
all these things, done a whit more than thy duty; nothing to plume
thyself on ; nothing thou canst cease to do without sin ; nothing thou
canst talk of ceasing to do, without making thy enemies chuckle and
thy friends sigh—as Punch sighs, and subscribes himself
Thine, in sorrow.
The Mangling Market.
IN the late snow-storm, the officials of the National Gallery almost
despaired of clearing the long pavement which runs through Trafalgar-
square, in front of their architectural cruet-stand. One of them, how-
ever, thought of the picture-cleaner, and by his exertions the path was
soon as smooth as the canvass of “Peace and War.” The Paving
Commissioners complain that this operation has damaged the stones.
| They intend to proceed against the Trustees of the National Gallery,
as they say the injury lies at their door.
THE BONDS OF THE IRISH PARTY.
THE “Hereditary Bondsmen,” whom O'CosNELL was so constantly
appealing to, must mean the Irish Landlords, whose mortgaged estates
fully entitle them to the appellation of “Bondsmen.” They are at
present “striking the blow,” in getting England to pay off their bonds,
for they know well enough that, without that, they never can be “free,”
or their estates either.

PUNCH's Historical PoRTRAIT GALLERY. THE POLITE PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER.
| M.R. H. GRATTAN is, it must be confessed, a perfect master of abuse.
If he cannot speak pearls and diamonds, he can at least throw dirt.
|This is something. His favourite aversion is MR. Roebuck, whom, it
may be remembered, he designated “a shrivelled adder.” Mr. Roe-
Buck will not suffer that united body of Irishmen, the landlords, to

at once, convey a clear notion of their peculiar qualities. “The Downy
|Beaver”—“The White Buffalo.”—“The Diving Mouse,” give us an
instant notion of the character of the bearer; and as the Speaker of the
House of Commons permitted the silver-tongued GRATTAN to apply to
a gentleman the term “shrivelled Adder,” we think that from the
whole world of lower animals might be judiciously selected a phrase of
equal significance, applicable to every member. We will suppose
a few :—
|
“The Hon. Scorpion, who has just stung the House"—
“The Hon. Viper, whom I do not see in his place"—
“The Right Hon. Weasel, asleep upon the Treasury Bench"—
“The Hon. and Learned Earwig, who has just sat down"—
“The Fon. and Gallant Field Mouse"—
“The Noble Jackass"—And so forth.

applied for admissions for two to all the London theatres. “A 1 and

HUGH M*NEILE AND A GENERAL FAST.
This gentleman has already obtained an unfortunate celebrity by
his sermon on the visit of PRINCE ALBERT to Liverpool—a sermon dis-
figured and debased by the most irreverent comparison of a mere man
with the Divine Nature. He has now penned a petition to the QUEEN
—a petition lying for signature at Liverpool—for a general fast.
MR. M*NEILE has, we understand, most laudably exerted himself in
behalf of the suffering Irish; but such exertions do not justify the
absurdity and audacity of the man who attributes the present famine
to the wickedness of the people, who have drawn upon themselves the
wrath of Heaven. “Your petitioners,” says the document—
“—cannot, therefore, hear the tidings daily arriving from Ireland, of inquest after
inquest returning verdicts of “death by starvation," without recognising the outstretched
hand of Almighty God.
“Your petitioners believe also, on the same sacred authority, and without presuming
to be wise above what is written, that famine and pestilence are two of the sore inflictions
of an offended God for the transgressions of a guilty people; and that when they appear,
wise men should hear in them a voice calling aloud to national repentance.
“Your petitioners are grieved to perceive that, by persons of station and influence,
..sentiments have been uttered wholly subversive of this fundamental principle of the
religion which your Majesty has solemnly sworn to defend, and calculated, as far as their
: ** can extend, to propagate practical infidelity amongst your Majesty's
subjects."
What—we ask it—have been the transgressions of the wronged and
wretched peasantry They have been ground to the dust by oppres-
sion, and they have never murmured. But—we think we discover the
meaning of the preacher—they have been smitten for the patience
with which they have endured long-suffering. Doubtless, thinks MR.
M“NEILE, there is a point at which resignation becomes pusillanimity.
If he do not mean this, we can see nothing in the words of the petition-
monger—nothing save religion turned inside out.
DIPLoMACY-The old proverb of “He lies like truth,” has been
altered for the use of rising diplomatists into “He lies like GUIzot.”
IMPERTINENT INTRUSION.
OLD WINTER has been lately playing the part of Don Basilio
in the Barber of Seville. No sooner did we imagine that we had
got fairly rid of him, than he comes back with his horrible
agitato movement and disagreeable tremolo. We had hoped
that he had gone to sleep for the next ten months at least,
and had wished him buona sera, when he suddenly returns,
making us shake hands whether we will or no, and rendering
himself eminently disagreeable. He seems to serenade us
somewhat after the following fashion :-
Oh leave the gay, the social room,
The fire so warm and bright,
And rove with me, 'mid cold and gloom,
In February's night.
And as you take your chilling way,
From home and comfort far,
'Tis not improbable you may
Incur a slight catarrh.
I'll tell thee how the lady sneezed,
When out in cold and rain ;
And how the podgy vet’ran wheezed,
And ne'er breath'd free again.
I'll tell thee how the feet kept dry,
The best preservers are;
But if your boots or shoes are shy,
You'll catch a slight catarrh.

A Stranger in the Gallery.
THE other night, at the close of business in the House of
Commons, the Sergeant-at-Arms made the awful announce-
ment that he had caught a stranger in the Members' Gallery.
The wretched intruder was at once seized, but it having been
explained that he had lost his way, he was discharged from
custody. It is natural enough that a stranger should lose
himself in such a labyrinth as the ways of the House of
Commons. Their narrowness, intricacy, and tortuosity are
certainly enough to bewilder any unfortunate stranger who
accidentally gets into them.

THE BEST
WINEGAR.
T last the Prussians, after
waiting more than a quarter
of a century, have got their
Constitution ; but the people
do not much like the taste of
it. They say that a Constitu-
tion, like wine, may be kept
too long. The present sample,
for instance, after being thirty
years in bottle, closely sealed
up, is found, when opened, to
be completely gone. It may have
been very good drinking, thirty
years ago — but at present
there's nothing in it—the spirit
has quite evaporated—it is no-
thing but vinegar. So many
of the boldest are calling upon
His Prussian MAJESTY to give
them a bottle of a newer vint-
age, with a little more body in
it. We say, most fervently, we only wish they may get it.
The Prussian Constitution may be reduced to two clauses ; but
then, like cakes of portable soup, there is a great deal in them, only
not so easy to swallow it :—
First. If the King wants any money, he will pay the Prussians the
compliment to ask for it before he takes it.
Second. But if the Prussians refuse it, they must not be offended if
the King tells them to go about their business.
It was scarcely worth waiting so long to get so little. But we have
a saving clause. Let us hope His Prussian MAJESTY has merely thrown
out the above clauses, lobster-like, by way of feeler.
AVALANCHES FOR THE MILLION.
LoNDoN has been within the last few days visited with a series of
small avalanches, which present a very singular phenomenon. The
celebrated PRofessor SKYLARK was riding in his Brougham in the neigh-
bourhood of Hyde Park Gardens one day last week, when his man was
suddenly rendered invisible, by being imbedded in a mountain of snow,
which transformed him into a sort of miniature Mont Blanc, whose
coronation will be remembered by all the readers of Lord ByRoN.
The Professor perceiving that some invisible agent had crowned his
coachman with “a diadem of snow,” began to philosophise on the ex-
traordinary fact, and proceeding to take an observation through his
pocket edition of Rosse's telescope, discovered a continuous fall of ava-
lanches on each sideof him. On proceeding further, and taking the paral-
lax of one of the stacks of chimneys, he made the beautiful discovery that
the avalanche, in which his coachman still remained imbedded, arose
not so much from a freak of Nature as from the bounty of the inhabi-
tants who were distributing the gifts of HYEMs among the passengers, in
the most liberal manner. PRofessor SKYLARK, on the stopping of his
carriage, proceeded to examine the condition of his unfortunate coach-
man, and was compelled to perform an operation, very like that of
ing a mummy.
As each separate layer of snow was removed the domestic began to
give signs of consciousness, and it was found that, luckily, the brim of
his hat had formed a ledge, underneath which he had continued to
breathe during the time of his being embedded under the snowy
diadem. It appears, on inquiry, that several of these avalanches have
fallen during the last week, in consequence of the inhabitants having
been engaged in shovelling the snow from the tops of their houses.
As the mansions about Hyde Park Gardens are unusually lofty, the
avalanche, descending from so great a height, has been more destructive
than in other lower localities. |
Wonderful Fulfilment of a Political Prediction.
IN our last Number we predicted that the KING of PRussia would
grant his subjects a Constitution on the 30th of February. We may
safely say that our prediction has been verified. His Majesty has pro-
duced what he calls a Constitution, but what, we are certain, the
Prussians will call nothing of the sort.

ALL ye spirits, blithe and witty,
Aid me with your powers divine;
Never shall I learn from CHITTY,
How to write a Valentine.
Help, oh help !—my pen refuses
To indite a loving strain ;
For the Temple of the Muses
Is removed to Drury Lane.
I can draw a declaration,
But my love cannot declare;
File a bill or information,
Yet am silent to the Fair.
Saints would take their affidavits,
Stones would shed their tears like bricks,
Even a bold dragoon would shave his
Moustache—if in such a fix.
Special pleading of no use is
When we plead at Beauty's shrine;
Still affection oft excuses
Errors in a Valentine.
Give me, dearest, but a trial ;
CUPID shall my counsel be,
He will take no coy denial,—
Kisses are his only fee.
Bid me lay aside my fear;
Listen to my plaintive suit,
And Love's juvenile idea—r
Teach, ch teach it how to shoot
Now I beg ten thousand pardons
As my name I do not sign,
But each day in Temple Gardens
You may see your Valentine.

PAINLESS OPERATIONS.
-
THE following resolution was unanimously agreed to at the last
meeting of the Directors of the Eastern Counties' Railway:—
“Resolved, that as it is advisable to stop the complaints of the
public as much as possible on account of the numerous accidents
which, somehow, will occur on the best-regulated railways, rooms be
immediately prepared at every station, where persons who dislike
being hurt or injured, or are foolishly apprehensive of danger, may
have the option of inhaling the ether, so that they may have the privi-
lege of remaining during the whole journey in a state of insensibility,
for which act of accommodation the Directors trust the public will be
duly thankful.”
THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.
by one of the MSELVES,
CHAPTER LI.--CLUB SNOBS.
WHY-why did I and WAGLEY ever do so cruel an action, as to
introduce young SAckville MAINE into that odious Sarcophagus !
Let our imprudence and his example be a warning to other gents; let
his fate and that of his poor wife be remembered by every British
female. The consequences of his entering the Club were as follows:–
One of the first vices the unhappy wretch acquired in this abode of
frivolity was that of smoking. Some of the dandies of the Club, such
as the MARQUIs of MACABAw, Lord DooDEEN, and fellows of that
high order, are in the habit of indulging in this propensity up-stairs in
the billiard-rooms of the Sarcophagus—and, partly to make their
acquaintance, partly from a natural aptitude for crime, SACKVILLE
MAINE followed them, and became an adept in the odious custom.
Where it is introduced into a family I need not say how sad the
consequences are, both to the furniture and the morals. SACKVILLE
smoked in his dining-room at home, and caused an agony to his wife
and mother-in-law which I do not venture to describe.
He then became a professed billiard-player, wasting hours upon hours

at that amusement; betting freely, playing tolerably, losing awfully to CAPTAIN
Spot and Col. CANNoN. He played matches of a hundred games with these gen-
tlemen, and would not only continue until four or five o'clock in the morning at
this work, but would be found at the Club of a forenoon, indulging himself to
the detriment of his business, the ruin of his health, and the neglect of his wife.
From billiards to whist is but a step—and when a man gets to whist and
five pounds as the rubber, my opinion is, that it is all up with him. How was
the coal-business to go on, and the connexion of the firm to be kept up, and
the senior partner always at the card-table 2
Consorting now with genteel persons and Pall Mall bucks, SACKVILLE be-
came ashamed of his snug little residence in Kennington Oval—and transported
his family to Pimlico—where, though MRs. CHUFF, his mother-in-law, was at
first happy, as the quarter was elegant and near her Sovereign, poor little
LAURA and the children found a woeful difference. Where were her friends
who came in with their work of a morning?—At Kennington and in the vicinity
of Clapham. Where were her children's little playmates ?–On Kennington
Common. The great thundering carriages that roared up and down the
drab-coloured streets of the new quarter, contained no friends for the sociable
little LAURA. The children that paced the squares, attended by a Bonne or a
prim governess, were not like those happy ones that flew kites, or played
hop-scotch, on the well-beloved old Common. And ah l what a difference at
Church, too !—between St. Benedict's of Pimlico, with open seats, service in
sing-song—tapers—albs—surplices—garlands and processions, and the honest
old ways of Kennington . The footmen, too, attending St. Benedict's were so
splendid and enormous, that JAMEs, MRs. CHUFF's boy, trembled amongst
them, and said he would give warning rather than carry the books to that
church any more.
The furnishing of the house was not done without expense.
And, ye gods ! what a difference there was between SACKVILLE's dreary
French banquets in Pimlico, and the jolly dinners at the Oval 1 No more legs
of mutton, no more of “the best port wine in England;” but entrées on plate,
and dismal twopenny champagne, and waiters in gloves, and the Club bucks
for company—among whom MRs. CHUFF was uneasy and MRs. SACKVILLE
quite silent.
Not that he dined at home often. The wretch had become a perfect epicure,
and dined commonly at the Club with the gormandizing clique there ; with
old DR. MAw, ColoneL CRAMLEY, (who is as lean as a greyhound and has
jaws like a jack,) and the rest of them. Here you might see the wretch, tippling

How SAckville lost his health ; how he lost his business ;
how he got into scrapes ; how he got into debt ; how he

GREAT TWOPENNY MEETING AT ST, PAUL’S.
[From our own Correspondent, who was locked in.]
NIGHT before last a very important meeting was
held of the Shades of the illustrious men buried
in the Cathedral, and also of those whose ashes
otherwise bestowed, have nevertheless monu-
ments erected to their memory in the sacred
edifice. Your reporter, having strolled into the
Cathedral to refresh his architectural taste, for
which he duly paid twopence at the door, was,
whilst indulging in a profound sleep—caused
by circumstances too minute to enumerate—
locked in. He awoke as the bell tolled twelve.
Immediately, he perceived that all the monu-
º, ments were in motion. Doctor Don NE walked
out of his urn, and gracefully folding his
winding-sheet about him, stept with great
dignity. LoRD DUNCAN sheathed his sword,
and adjusted his boat-cloak. SIR RALPH
ABERCROMBIE rose from the arms of the
Highland soldier who has for so many years supported him ; and
Nelson stept from his pedestal, BRITANNLA herself giving him her
hand as he descended. SIR CHRistoph ER WREN came from the crypt,
majestic and venerable in his looks of 91. In a word, all the worthies
of St. Paul's were in motion, and it was plain that there was some
important business in hand. The church was beautifully lighted as
by a July sun ; and the organ pealed forth a magnificent voluntary.
As it ceased I heard a heavy tread, and, looking round, saw DocroR
Johnson, holding up his robes, certainly not with the grace of his
friend GARRICK, and shaking his head and scroll, and gesticulating
very oddly. All the other Shades bowed to him ; and then there was
a general hush. SIR CHRIstophER WREN was unanimously called
upon to preside. Who, indeed, so fitting 7
SIR CHRISToPHER opened the proceedings.-Brother Shades, we
have by one general impulse been moved to this gathering. For
many years have our spirits been tormented by the rattling of half-
pence and the ringing of sixpences and shillings taken and changed
at the Cathedral door, that we may be shown as they show the lions
in the Tower, or the dromedary and monkey and dancing bears in the
street. By my troth, worthy friends, when I built this Cathedral I
deemed it was to be dedicated to a purpose of holiness, and not for
the lucre of money-changers. (“Hear,” from Doctor Johnson.)
When I look about me, and see the awful representatives of philo-
sophers, and divines, and heroes, I do feel that their moral dignity is
insulted and made a byword, when, like the beasts at Bartlemy Fair,
they are shown for shillings. Our object, I believe, is to remonstrate
with the Dean and Chapter, who, if their hearts are not to be turned
shall seem fit and meet.
Doctor Johnson proposed the first resolution. The great architect
—the father, he might say, of that tremendous edifice, that, in the
words of a great and good man, though he was sorry to say he was a
Dissenter, that tremendous edifice that would “strike awe into a bac-
chanal”—SIR CHRIstopher had well delineated the humiliation to
which they were spiritually subjected by the pecuniary gulosity of
the ecclesiastical authorities. Let them, however, be incorporate and
unanimous, and the degrading Twopence must pass away with other
mortuary and sublunary abuses. They must now do something ;
they must not, as he had observed on another occasion, re-act the old
all their heaving, only produced muscipular abortions.
LoRD NElson said the whole Dean and Chapter wanted a thorough
overhauling. A good many of them were, in his opinion, a set of
lubbers that—(Cries of “Order, order 1" from Doctors DoNNE and
Johnson)—Well, for his part, he had no wish to offend the parsons ;
but he did not think that Mother Church ought to higgle and haggle
with halfpence—for all the world like a bum-boat woman selling soft
tommy. Besides, if money was to be taken—if they were all to be
made a show of like MRs. SALMoN's wax-work that he remembered
when a boy, why not have the thing done plain and above-board 7
Why didn't the Dean and Chapter always have a signal flying with
“St. Paul's expects every man to pay his twopence 7" In conclusion,
the gallant Earl observed (with a slight oath) that he was ready to
do anything to overhaul the parsons.
GENERAL Wolfe said he had a great respect for the Church, and
all Church associations. It might not be generally known ; but the
night before he received his death-wound he had read and got by
heart the very beautiful elegy by MR. GRAY. Therefore, in the most
respectful—nay, in the most affectionate spirit, he would co-operate
with the gallant admiral in his own fine, tarpaulin phrase, to overhaul
the parsons.
ADMIRAL LoRD Collingwood observed that, to speak the truth,
he did not think sailors and soldiers had any business at all in
Cathedrals. (“Hear, hear,” from the two services.) Fighting had
been their trade ; and they had done their best. Nevertheless, he did
not think that the true odour of Christianity was to be found in gun-
powder ; or that the Army of Martyrs meant soldiers with guns and
bayonets, and forty-two pounders. The Church Militant was not, in
his opinion, a Church with Ball-Cartridge.
been placed there, he felt in common with his friends the indignity
put upon them by the Twopence, and would heartily co-operate for
its abolition.
Here the meeting became very noisy. MR. John OPIE, R.A.,
began to speak—when he was interrupted by Fusel1, who stamped
and foamed at the mouth, and made very free indeed with “the par-
sons.” He observed, it had been said of him that “his domain was
air and hell ; the clouds and the grave. It was he who made real and
visible the vague and unsubstantial phantoms which haunt, like dim
dreams, the oppressed imagination.” If this were true—and he, for
However, as they had
one, could not deny it—“he would advise the parsons to look out for
themselves. He would not be shown like a dancing bear ; he would
not—” (and then he swore).
Hereupon Doctor Johnson moved that the meeting should dissolve:
and, after certain formalities, the meeting was dissolved accordingly.
It being understood that the Dean and Chapter should be firmly and
respectfully remonstrated with, that they might discontinue the
twopence ; and that, in the event of their contumacious denial, the
Ghosts of the Statues should take it in turn to make midnight calls
on each and every of the reverend body.
This determination seemed to give great pleasure to the naval
ghosts; and LoRD NElson, sheathing his sword, again mounted to his
pedestal, muttering something about “overhauling the parsons.”

THE SNOW AND THE STATUE.

A New appeal has this week been made to the public on behalf of the
Wellington Statue, which has appeared in the character of a poor frozen-out
equestrian. The snow has stood upon its arms, nestled in its cocked hat,
fringed its nose, conglomerated in its eyes, and stagnated on its saddle. The
snow would melt the coldest heart to consent to a removal of the monster, which
is only catching cold so long as it remains in its present position. The horse,
which seemed almost fo speak a short time ago, is getting hoarser every day;
and the Duke, who seemed but lately as brilliant as a bright poker, is hourly
getting dingier and dingier. The original stood the firing of Waterloo, but the
copy cannot even tolerate the smoke of London. He is beginning to get black
in the face, as if with anger at the treatment he has experienced.
Out 33irtùtig5ts amb out 35tables
Such is the inspiriting cry that now resounds through the parish of Fulham.
The glorious motto enters the parish at the first turning to the right, then
takes the second to the left, then the first to the right again, and there it is,
filling the whole parochial air with its echoes. “Our birthrights, and our
beadles,” is the cry that is now coming home to our businesses and bosoms.
Fulham, is at the present moment beadleless. There is a sort of cocked-hat
interregnum, during which the staff lies neglected in the hands of nobody, and
the energies of the cane are dormant. Anarchy is in the streets of the
beadle-bereft district ; juvenile rebellion throws the snow-ball, cuts out the
slide, pelts the pump, and talks in church on a Sunday.
It is a healthy sign there is little competition for the vacant collar, cuffs,
cape—or victorine, and came of beadlery. It is evident that absolute power
is no longer coveted, and that a mixed constitutional beadle—like that in the
Quadrant, who is associated with the “civil” power—must be very preferable
to the pure despotism in beadles, like that which keeps Fulham under the
beadlian thumb during the present century.
As the parish is to have a new beadle, now is the time to strike for Ty—rol—
or, rather, for Tol de rol, and Liber-tea. Let us all determine to vote for
no beadle but the one who will give us a constitution to secure our own, or
at least, our children's liberties. The right of assembly at a
Punch and Judy show must be conceded. We must have
a guarantee that the sliding-scale shall be abolished as far as
the pāvements are concerned, and that the principles of pro-
|tection shall still be adhered to.
We have every hope that the next beadle of Fulham will
|evince the reforming and liberal spirit shown by the new Pope,
whom, we believe, our candidate has closely studied. There is
an important omission observable in his canvassing letter, for
he omits to state the number of his children. We believe the
| children's qualification is indispensable. Had he been able to
throw NINE CHILDREN into LARGE. Type, or even to put a baby
in arms into syſALL CAPs, there would have been an approach
to i. sympathies which can only be reached through such a
medium.

better than to let his son go and marry, without taking care
astonishes us. As His Majesty is his own minister, so, we
imagine, he is his own lawyer, and has accordingly the sort of
client that such lawyers are proverbially said to have. Is
it possible that, with the value of Spanish bonds before his

think that M. JULLIEN should compose an Orleans Quadrille,
in which His Majesty might be supposed to execute such a solo
on the piccolo.
It may, perhaps, be surmised that this demand of an apanage
will be made the pretext for annexation of Spain; but we
doubt, after all, if the KING of THE FRENch has an eye to
the Spanish crown. We suspect he thinks a great deal more
of five-shilling-pieces than of crowns. It strikes us that all
his ambition, in the MonTrexsie R marriage case, was simply,
that his son should marry a lady with money. His disap-
pointment will only increase the derision which he has incurred
by the transaction in question. We doubt not that, in a short
time, he will be saluted by the Parisian mob with the cry of

THE SNOBS OF ENGLAND.

CHAIPTER LAST.
HOW it is that we have come

of papers, my dear friends and
brother Snobs, I hardly know
—but for a whole mortal year

tling, and abusing the human

Some weeks since, happening to have the felicity to sit next to a
young lady at a hospitable table, where poor old JAwKINs was holding
forth in a very absurd pompous manner, I wrote upon the spotless
damask “S B,” and called my neighbour's attention to the little
remark.
That young lady smiled. She knew it at once. Her mind straight-
way filled up the two letters concealed by apostrophic reserve, and I
read in her assenting eyes that she knew JAwkins was a Snob. You
seldom get them to make use of the word as yet, it is true; but it is
inconceivable how pretty an expression their little smiling mouths
assume when they speak it out. If any young lady doubts, just let
her go up to her own room, look at herself steadily in the glass, and
say “Snob.” If she tries this simple experiment, my life for it, she
will smile, and own that the word becomes her mouth amazingly. A
pretty little round word, all composed of soft letters, with a hiss at the
beginning, just to make it piquant, as it were.
JAwRINs, meanwhile, went on blundering and bragging and boring,
quite unconsciously. And so he will, no doubt, go on roaring and
braying to the end of time, or at least so long as people will hear him.
You cannot alter the nature of men and Snobs by any force of satire ;
as, by laying ever so many stripes on a donkey's back you can't turn
him into a zebra.
But we can warn the neighbourhood that the person whom they
and JAwKINs admire is an impostor. We can apply the Snob test to
him, and try whether he is conceited and a quack, whether pompous
and lacking humility—whether uncharitable and proud of his narrow
soul. How does he treat a great man—how regard a small one How
does he comport himself in the presence of His Grace the Duke ; and

We would submit good-naturedly to sit in a high place. We would

for the interest of SMITH's army that young DE BRAY should be a
Colonel at five-and-twenty, of SMITH's diplomatic relations that LoRD

Society. You, who despise your neighbour, are a Snob ; you, who
forget your own friends, meanly to follow after those of a higher

for your calling, are a Snob ; as are you who boast of your pedigree,
or are proud of your wealth.

LEGISLATING IN THE DARR.
SoME short-sighted Member (MR. HUME, we think) complained of
the very bad lighting of the House. We should say that, considering
how very, obscure most of the public measures were, there was a sad
deficiency of light in the House of Commons which prevented Members
seeing things as clearly as people out of doors. The light seems to
come all from one side—a kind of party light—which may account for
such one-sided views being always taken of the laws of the country by
those who have been legislating in the dark. There appears to be the
Tory light, the Whig light, and the Radical light, and that farthing
rushlight, the Protectionist light. Now, the sooner these lights are
merged into one, and a good central light introduced, by which Members
shall be able to see the same on all sides of the House, the better it will
be for those who have an antipathy to taxes. We do not know of a
better one than the Light of Truth. It is cheap—requires no snuffing
—trims itself—never goes out, and gives the light of we don't know
how many million candles. Will any tallow-chandler inform the House

THE NEW GAME OF “FRENCH AND ENGLISH.”
LoRD BRough AM, it is said, is fond of hearing himself talk. We
confess that we like to hear him talk too—whenever he talks as follows.
Mettraye, we should premise, is a school for the reformation of convict
children :—
“It was to the honour of the sister kingdom, that the French Government had aided
the Mettraye Institution by grants of money, it being partly supported by the labour of
the convicts themselves. They had also founded twelve similar institutions in other
parts of France, in consequence of the great success that had attended that at Mettrage.
If he had a feeling of rivalry with respect to France—if he had any national feeling, it
led him to envy the French government, far more for having established such institutions,
than for all their colonies in Algeria—than all their Spanish Marriages—than all the
glory of NAPolson and TuRENNE, against which he would set the brighter glory of his
noble friend who sat near him (the Dukz of WELLINGroN). He hoped and prayed
that they might soon think only of the rivalry he had mentioned, and that the trifling
quarrels and trumpery objections they had lately heard of, would give way to subjects of
greater interest and importance.”
Thus, according to the Times' report, spoke Lord BR.org HAM, the
other evening, in the House of Lords. Bravo, HENRY | Since there
must, of course, always exist some feeling of rivalry between France and
England, we hope that it will assume the form which his Lordship
desiderates. We shall then endeavour to cut out French penitentiaries
instead of French fleets, and it will be our national boast, that one of
our own schoolmasters is equal to three of our neighbours'. We shall
mutually vie in teaching the young idea to shoot—without a musket.
Our war-cry will be—“Up, scholars, and at them l’” We shall alter, not
abolish, a favourite pastime of the Old School. The game of “French
and English" will be played—with a difference—in the New.

MISS GRIFFIN'S ESTABLISHMENT FOR YOUNG LADIES.
THIS finishing establishment
for young ladies, not being
conducted on common
principles, has not its va-
cations at the vulgar time
of Christmas or Midsum-
mer. Hence, the examina-
tion of the pupils before
breaking up took place last
week; and Miss GRIFFIN,
knowing the great interest
that Punch takes in the
proper education of the
female mind, very hand-
somely scnt him a card
and a patent safety cab,
requesting the honour of
his attendance. Now, Miss
GRIFFIN's establishment
is really finishing, its
whole object being to turn
out the fair pupils fully
impressed with the solemn
responsibilities of mar-
riage ; a knowledge of
housewifery and cookery
being rightly considered
among the most serious.
Thus, Miss GRIFFIN gives practical lectures. Whenever she goes to market she takes a
select class with her, who, by such means, obtain a perfect knowledge of the tenderness of
beef in all its joints, and learn how “to choose fish,” and detect the age of poultry. Some-
thing like a “finished” education this
We were present at the examination last week, and were delighted with the fluency and
correctness with which nearly all the young ladies answered leading questions on English
Housewifery and Cookery. (M. SoYER, by the way, is engaged as the master of French
dishes.) The young ladies were assembled in a row, and their examination gradually rose
from rump-steaks to turtle. It was quite delightful to listen to the silvery voices of the
lovely girls, as they prattled of “ketchup" and “shreds of shalots,” and then deepened into
“onions.” One young lady carried off as a prize—for fitting prizes were bestowed—a very
handsome silver butter-boat, given as a reward for the admirable manner in which she
described the cooking of a calf's-head, throwing in various original suggestions that proved,
from her intimate knowledge of the subject, she would be a treasure to any man.
Another pupil received half-a-dozen silver skewers for the adroit and elegant way with
which she carved a fowl, making no more of it than if it had been a roasted Cupid.
Another bright-eyed little thing, not above sixteen, “took down” a whole row, getting at
once to the head of the “Pastry” class upon her intimate knowledge of tipsy-cake. The
whole class was at fault as to the relative proportions of brandy with other ingredients,
when she cried out, “Six spoonsfull of the best white,” when, as we have said, she took
them all down, and won for a prize a Punch-ladle, with VicToRIA's face smiling in gold in
the middle of it.
The “Chicken Currie” class was particularly interesting, from the solemnity with which
the examination was carried on. Miss GRIFFIN evidently felt that the eye of Punch was
upon her ; and therefore commenced her interrogatories with beseeming gravity. And the
class—six bouncing girls—felt the presence of their august visitor, and were in a state of
very proper trepidation.
“How to make a chicken currie 7" asked Miss GRIFFIN, in a solemn voice.
“Cut up the chickens raw,” said the head girl, “slice shalots—”
“Onions,” cried the second.
“Take her down, Miss BRiggs,” said Miss GRIFFIN, and the first girl was taken down
accordingly.
“Slice onions, and fry both in butter of a fine auburn brown,” said the third.
joints in a stewpan with veal or mutton gravy, and a clove or two—”
“Clove of what ?” cried Miss GRIFFIN,-and number four was at fault.
“Clove of garlic,” shrieked number five; and of course she took number four down.
And in this way the different classes went through the whole Cookery Book ; winding up
with the “Bishop” and “Grog” class. And we must say it—the progress of the young
ladies as to the mixture of “bishop,” “cardinal,” and so forth, was delicious to listen to.
The “Grog” class was no less excellent : we must give a sample. It was the “Chicken
Currie” class, again examined.
“Young ladies,” said Miss GRIFFIN, “it ought to form the reasonable hope of every young
woman entering upon life, that some excellent, endearing man may think her worthy of
being exalted to the honour of the marriage state. In looking at the various vicissitudes of
this changeful world, every young lady cannot do better than keep her eye wide open to the
probability of the wedding-ring. Now, it is not enough to catch the affection of a husband—
no; the grand secret is, to hold what you catch. Husbands are like those little delicate
“Lay the
love-birds on sale at the Pantheon ; easy, as I
am told, to cage, but difficult to keep. Now, it
is the weakness of most men to be at times
addicted to spirituous admixtures; and it would
ill become me, as a teacher of female youth—as
the Principal of the Finishing Housewifery Esta-
blishment, and, as I may say, a Living Guide to
the Marriage Service—to suffer any young
woman to leave my tuition without having
passed her examination as to what I may call
the proper conjugal mixture of brandy-and-
water, and of other grog or grogs.” Here-
upon Miss GRIFFIN drew herself up, and
asked, “How to make a Husband a first glass
of brandy-and-water 2"
“Half-and-half,” said Miss BRIggs; and Miss
GRIFFIN bowed assent.
“How a second P’’
“Two waters, one brandy,” answered number
two ; and all the responses, varying with the
supposed number of glasses, showed equal wis-
dom and foresight on the part of the scholars.
We have not room to dilate upon the “Pick-
ling" class, but we must say, until then we never
saw the latent beauties of cabbage and gherkins.
In brief, we left Miss GRIFFIN's establish-
ment with a still higher appreciation of the
noble qualities of the female mind, when, as
we had witnessed, so beautifully, so wisely
directed.
We shall be happy—in confidence—to send
Miss GRIFFIN's card to every mother interested
in the connubial prospects of it may be—an

FRESCOES FOR PARLIAMENT.
LIKE a number of little children, who, when
they are promised anything new, want to have
immediate enjoyment of the novelty, the Mem-
bers of the House of Lords are anxious to get into
the new building before the walls are dry, and
before the frescoes are even finished. It will be
necessary, therefore, for the artists to work in
the daytime; and after the Peers have held
their sittings at night, it is not improbable they
will carry away on their backs the occasional
impress of some historical portrait. We have
no doubt that a good deal of stencilling will be
accomplished on the coats of their Lordships in
this curious manner. We do not know whether
they will be guilty of an infringement of copy-
right, by walking away with a fine proof im-
pression, of their having had a design upon the
picture, or the picture having had a design upon
them, which would be nearly identical. We
seriously warn their Lordships against the
danger of damp houses, and we earnestly re-
commend that one of the prosiest of the Peers
should be requested to go and speak for an hour
a day within the walls, in order to aid in drying
the building.

that Kidney (which, however, we prefer not to give name to, just at
Present) he would not have held it so comfortably on the Whole, before
that very pendulous, portentous nose of Oliver's, ready to wrinkle in
sudden Scorn and Bauble-Defiance, and those Five Fingers clasped
round that brown iron Broad-Sword-Hilt. Somehow, this Figure
appears to us meant for an altogether different kind of World from this
of the WINDBAGs—not made for its calf-leather boots to tread on Sham
Froth Floors, with Iron Heels crushing noisily, nor to live on St.
Stephen's Soap-Bubbles, and such evanescent, windy Pabulum as
WINDBAG and DRYASDUST are fain to furnish between them. On the
Whole, OLIVER would scarce have been at Home in this choky, hot,
Steam-Vapour of our 19th Century, with our Sanatory Regulations,
and shrieking GossET-Privilege Questions, and Pie-Crust-BARRY
Decorations, and AEolus Discord of REID-Ventilation, great Carrying-
out of the WINDBAG principle, and suitable altogether to our West-
minster “Great Talk,” or Parliament, which is “Speaking” in the
Anglo-Norman.
Altogether, Probably, OLIVER would have inarticulately somehow
said to us, “On the Whole, I prefer the pitch-dark Nowhere, and infi-
nite Space, to this dim, black-grey, London-Fog of a Sham World.”—
Still, here is his Picture.
“%ig 310tugjip botſ) 33rotegt too mutſ), metjimi.g.”
oRD RADNOR is ready to die, at any moment, for
St. ADAM SMITH and the blessed MAcculloch.
He wants the Irish peasantry to follow his ex-
ample. His protest against the Destitute Relief
Bill is a very powerful admonition to empty
bellies not to grumble. Starvation is met by
science, and death made demonstrably necessary.
It must be a great comfort to Skibbereen to learn
that nothing whatever can be done for its hun-
ger; that there are the most satisfactory reasons
why Ireland should starve, and England refuse
to help her.
We want a new Gospel of Political Economy for the use of nations
in extremis. For “mercy,” it should read “demand and supply;” and for
“charity,” “natural check.” . For “Do unto others as you would that
others should do unto you,” the new Evangel must run, “Leave things
to find their level.” Where the Christian law says, “Feed the hungry
and clothe the naked,” the RADNoR dispensation substitutes “Rely on
your own exertions.” For “Blessed are those that give,” the new
beatitude is, “Blessed are those who take care of themselves and leave -
others to do the same.”
LoRD RADNoh is probably a humane man, and it is, perhaps, not
without considerable self-scarification, that he has vitreſſed his heart
in the furnace of political economy. He may be standing in the midst
of the dying and the dead, the daily victims of fever and famine, as
the Red Indian among his torture-fires, suffering intensely, but glory-
ing in the suppression of wince, groan, or tear-singing, as a cheerful
death-song, the triumph of Economical Principles, while his heart
bleeds with sympathy, and exposing his softest parts of humanity to
the stings and arrows of the press, with an imperturbability that
results not from want of feeling, but rare power of self-command.
If so, Lord RADNor is a pitiful spectacle of savage virtue. He
mistakes the time and text of his sermon. This is not “the natural
state of things” we are dealing with. It is too late for “people to rely
on their own exertions.” They have not the strength to make them.
God help the poor Irish to whom LoRD RADNoR talks of “energy.”
and “disclosing resources.”
Does the doctor, when he brings comfort to a bedside, preach to his
patient of the duties of temperance and caution while in health? Does he
begin an elaborate proof, that what the sick man is suffering is the result
of his own folly and heedlessness and excess; that if he get better he
will very likely fall ill again, from dependance on his physician's power
of cure 1 No; he relieves and cures. England is Ireland's physician.
She must relieve, not talk. She must mortgage every acre, pawn every
loom, anticipate every penny of her income, rather than the horror of
such starvation should continue.
Keep political economy to its time and place, and we will listen to it.
But ADAM SMITH is not the prophet that should stand between the
dying and the dead. The prophet for that office bears a holier name,
and raises a nobler gospel -
LoRD RADNok's protest stands alone. He is the Cocles of our time;
the one man bold enough to cut down the bridge, in the face of Ireland's
starving thousands pouring in upon us. We do not envy him the nerve
that such a task requires.
Monsieuh CHABERT, the Fire King, cooked his own mutton chops in
his own furnace, and came out looking calm and composed. So, in the
awful hour of the Irish famine, LoRD RADNoR pens his protest, calmly
such question of Statue or no Statue with DRYAsdust, and others of and collectedly; when common hands would be stricken into charity,
and hearts, even of ordinary economical proof, melted into running
waters of relief.
THE POLITICAL JOHN GILPIN.
GEoRGE BENTINck was a sporting man
Of credit and renown,
A stud in training eke had he,
For Epsom's famous down.
GEORGE BENTINCR to himself said he,
Though M. P. I have been
For many years, yet in debate
My name is seldom seen.
John Russell to the Commons goes,
As rumour doth declare,
A bill for Ireland to propose,
And I will meet him there.
There’s Borthwick, simple as a child,
Myself and DisrAEL(EE);
We'll start the game, and other fools
Are sure to follow we.
I am a rider free and bold,
As all the world doth know,
And my good friend the Railway King
Lends me a dodge or so.
The evening came, the dodge was plann'd,
An Irish railway grant,
And sixteen million little pounds
Was all, they said, they’d want.
So BENTINCR, HUDsoN, Borthwick, BEN,
The measure did bring in ;
Four precious souls, and all agog
To dash through thick and thin.
Away they rush'd, on went their tongues,
No rest their hearers had ;
The speeches seem'd to be composed
Of eloquence run mad.
GEoRGE BENTINCR his steam hobby rode
With all his might and main ;
And up he kept himself awhile,
But soon came down again.
Away went BENTINCR, neck or nought,
'Gainst every timid Whig ;
They little dreamt when he set out
He would run such a rig.
Some Irish members cheer'd him on ;
Protectionists and all
Cried out, “Go at it, GEORGE: well done !”
As loud as they could bawl.
Away went BENTINCR, who but he
Could run such pace around 2
He carries weight, he rides a race
For sixteen million pound.
And every one that saw him run
Believed it was for place ;
Against John Russell they declared
GEORGE BENTINCR rode a race.
And so he did, and lost it too,
For every one in town
Where he had been on getting up,
Found him on sitting down.
Let's sing I wean, long live the QUEEN,
And BENTINck long live he ;
When next he his steam hobby rides
May we be there to see.

THE Times speaks of a report of the arrival of MIGUEL in London,

nevertheless, a circumstance has come to our knowledge which we print
for the information of Lord PALMERston. Late last night, a Parcels
Delivery cart was drawn up at the door of the Morning Post, and a
parcel placed within it—a parcel marked “With care, this side
upwards.” We may be wrong, but, from this description, we think
the article was no other than the crown of Portugal, spoken of in our

fact that the cart drove to — Street, Camden Town, and the parcel
was delivered at a small butcher's, “for the foreign gent as lived in

by kicking against them. His Lordship is said to have been severely
stung ; and if this is true, he must be a frightful object, for he was
already much puffed up when he provoked their hostility. Some say
that he upset this angry hive in consequence of being pushed on

him so dangerous a trick.

RAILWAYS For IRELAND.
STATION ON AN IRISH RAILWAY. —PASSENGERS WAITING FOR TRAIN.

|--|--|-- m
Tummum
WHILE LoRD GEORGE BENTINck was insisting on the great importance of giving
Railways to Ireland, without a probability of either goods or passengers to carry, we
understand that the terrible example afforded by our own little Kensington Railway
never once occurred to him. Never shall we forget the impression created by the
opening of that line, where a table of phantom fares might be seen, arrayed for the
purpose of attracting a purely visionary traffic. Spectral stokers were standing there
with nothing to stoke; inspectors were there with nothing but the most dreary look-
out open to their inspection. It was idle to attempt to get up a hectic and feverish
desire on the part of the public to run from the Scrubbs of Wormwood to the
back of the Crescent of Kensington. It was a railway without a result—a road
leading from a place where nobody ever was, to a place where nobody was ever going.
It is true that Great Western sagacity discovered that the line only wanted a place
to start from, and a place to go to, in order to render it convenient to the public and
profitable to the shareholders.
By adding a bit at both ends, the line which led nowhere and began nowhere, will
be connected with an important link of communication between a flourishing suburb
and the centre of the Metropolis. High beats the heart of Hammersmith, and happy
is Hungerford, at the prospect of their speedy union! But Irish railways would be in |
a state of irredeemable destitution ; for extend them as far as you could, it would
be impossible to carry them to a point of profit. Though there was no chance of suc-
cess while the Bush of the Shepherds remained the terminus of the Kensington line,
whole flocks will rush to be conveyed upon it when pushed to the Broadway at
Hammersmith.
It is different in Ireland, where every railway must be what our own railway used to
be. The case will indeed be worse, for as the ground is out of cultivation, there is
not a chance of those dividends in the shape of lettuces which used occasionally to
be declared to the shareholders of the Kensington. We shall never forget the ardour
with which, as an original allottee, we exchanged our scrip for some registered sprouts,
without the coupon or stalk, which was left to create a sort of rest for future
produce ; nor shall we ever cease to remember our own energetic efforts to get an
extension of the line to Savoy, with a deviation towards Brussels—(sprouts).
M. DUMAS, THE LITERARY BRIAREUS.
THE Porcupine Man who appeared on the stage of life some years ago, only
shadowed the great coming event—ALExANDRE DUMAs, certainly the greatest hero of
quills yet vouchsafed to the world. The recent trial, in which the literary monster
was proceeded against for breach of supply of foolscap, reveals the tremendous energies
of the man. He haunts the world, a goose-quill demon He lives on paper, and
bathes in ink. He writes five feuilletons at a time; that is, a feuilleton with every
right-hand finger. Horses of best blood pant to keep up with him; and the railway
stokers heap up coals, and the engineer puts the train to double speed, and all to
supply the Paris press with the written thoughts of M. DUMAs I Now, for any man
to do this, to be modest, would be treason to his genius. He knows that he covers the
whole world with a sky of paper, and that all the human race walk only by his light.
Therefore, what would be the grossest impudence in a man of genius, is merely grace
in the Demon of Authors. “Who dare assign a limit to genius” asks M. DUMAs;
and, says the report, there is a “movement” among the auditors at the interrogation.
M. DUMAs engages to supply eighty volumes; and he supplies them : Whereupon,
he says, and hardly says enough:—
“The whole Académie together, forty in number, could not have produced eighty volumes in the
time allowed me by my publishers. I had begun five different romances in five different journals. I have
finished them all in the given time, and every word is written by my own hand. [Oh! Alexandr E!] I
have done what no man ever did before, and what none but myself can ever do again.”
|
The Demon continues :—
“I have at this moment three horses ready saddled in my stables—three grooms ready booted, ready
spurred to mount–then the railway going every hour to carry my feuilletons to Paris.”
And whilst this was going forward—adds a corre-
spondent of the Atlas—DUMAs was revelling with his
friends in a wood, hunting and feasting, the “most
uproarious of them all.” And the guests knew “nothing
of the toil and trouble of the nights,” when the Demon
was at work.
Now, it has been scandalously reported, and of course
as generally believed, that ALExANDRE DUMAs is only
the Director of a Company of novel-mongers ; and
that what appears under his name is, about nine-
tenths of it, the work of inferior quills. But then,
ALEXANDRE -
“Sheds o'er the page his purity of soul,
Corrects each error, and refines the whole.”
This is, of course, the base calumny of base envy;
for DUMAs says he writes every word with his own
hand; or rather, hands; for, like BRIAREUs, he has a
hundred of them, and can write with each. How, other-
wise, could he meet the impatience of three horses ready
saddled—three grooms ready booted—and the railway,
starting every hour to Paris with copy 2 We are sorry
to be compelled to say it; but we have it from our
own correspondent, that DUMAs has sold himself to the
Printer's Devil, for the use of a hundred hands, with a
pen in each, so many hours every night. Thus, after
his “delightful dinners” at his Pavillon de Henri
Quatre at St. Germain—and his “revelling in the
woods, hunting and feasting”—and his “petits sou-
pers” are concluded, he retires to his chamber, and,

taking off his coat, has, for certain hours of the
night, the unlimited use of a whole hundred hands, with
pens, like bread, a discrétion.
The Water-Gruel System.
THE German papers say the KING of PRUssíA has
published his Constitution at a very seasonable period.
The weakness of the Diet is beautifully adapted to a
season of fasting, like Lent. Let us hope that His
Majesty, as soon as he perceives that Prussia is still
suffering under constitutional weakness, will make her
Diet a little stronger. As it is, it really seems as if
he had taken for his recipe the Poor-Law Diet of
England. The strongest microscope would be puzzled
to find anything substantial in the provisions of either.
THE MONIED MONARCH.
THE Bank of France has applied to the Bank of
England for a loan. Need its Directors have travelled
so far for assistance 2 They seem quite to have over-
looked the hoards of the Tuileries. Surely Louis-
PHILIPPE could have spoken to a friend, who, on the
usual terms of course, could have cashed them a bill
to any amount.

THE ENGLISH IN LITTLE.
BY GENERAL TOM THUMB.
THE GENERAL IS SEVERELY KISSED, AND HITS UPON AN
ExPEDIENT TO RELIEVE HIMSELF.
|RE you ready, Gen'ral 7” ses
BARNUM. “Quite ready,” ses
I. “You may let the critters
in.” With this BARNUM waves
| his hand, Majesty-like, and
| | the doors fly back. Well,
* I never on airth did I see such
a shoal of humans ! If they
Lº didn't swim in-like herrins
Sºº —over one another's shoul-
ºf ders, I'm a sea-horse. I could
see them through a leetle hole
in the curtain ; for I hadn't
walked out upon the table
yet. And there they was
Such a mighty sight of grand-
mothers, and mothers and
daughters ; ten women to two
men, and one in. Well, I will
confess it : I couldn't help
sayin agin to meself—“You
hippopotamuses I haven't you
got nothin o' your own at
home to nurse—no babbies ; or, if no babbies, not even a spaniel
or a kitten, to make a screeching hubbaboo about, but you must
come out o' your own houses, to break your stay-laces, and have
your ribbons—that cost them honest critters, your husbands, so
much—tore slick off your bonnets, scrouging to see the smallest piece
on airth of human natur f * Yes; I will say it : I do have these
thoughts that belittle me—all really great critters have, BARNUM
tells me ; and the bigger they are, he says—in spirit, in coors, I
mean—the leetler will they sometimes insist upon bein. “It’s all
in the brain,” ses BARNUM ; “and the brain,” ses he, “is jist for all the
world like a bit of ingy-rubber; the further you pull it out, with
the greater the force, and all the backwarder it will go back.” How-
ever, about these female critters. When the room was quite full—
and, with the fine clothes, and the ribbons, and all that the women
had about 'em, you would have thought it had been a gen'ral meetin
of all the rainbows, past and to come, of all creation—when the room
was as full, and as noisy as a whole forest of cockatoos, I steps out.
Well, you should have heerd the shrekin | You should have heerd
the precious names they called me—'t was enough to break the heart
of a peacock with delight, as BARNUM said to me afterwards. As
for meself—you know I’m used to it, now—I was bashful, shame-
faced like, they said sich things to me. If I didn't blush to that
degree that my shirt was tinder, I'm a varmint. Well, I danced in
coorse, and sung my songs, and all that ; and the critters were all but
faintin with pleasure. At last, when we got a leetle quiet, BARNUM
pinted out to the people the dimond ring that Gracious Majesty had
given me—and the dimond studs, and the goold pencil-case, and all
the jew'llry. I sartinly did think that some on 'em would have
dropped upon their knees, when they looked at 'em. And then they
stared at me agin, as if somehow—knowin how I'd been treated at
the palace—they thought I'd brought somethin royal, precious like
about me, when I came away. But there was one thing happened
that whips the universal airth. And this is it.
These critters think that whatever comes from a palace must have
N W

kinder magic in it : and so, one old lady comes up to BARNUM, with
tears a runnin down her face like rain-drops down window-frames,
and ses—“My dear Mister, could you do me the leetle favour to lend
me the dimond ring that Gracious Majesty give to the Gen'ral.”
“What on airth do you want it for 7” ses BARNUM.
“Why, jist for this,” ses the old lady. “The fact is—my leetle
boy—poor critter! has got a humpback.”
“Well?” ses BARNUM, as much as to say—“I havn't.”
“And I’m mortal sure on it,” ses the old lady, “that if a leetle
pimple, or sty, is to be rubbed away by a plain goold ring—as it
always is "–
“Well ?” ses BARNUM agin—“Allowin it—what then 7”
“Why, that my leetle boy's humpback could be rubbed quite
straight by the ring with the QUEEN's dimond in it.”
Dreadful, isn't it, to think on the superstition of these poor critters ?
But so it is, or I'm worse nor a snake. Well, now I'm a goin to tell
you the beginnin o' my troubles.
After I'd done my dance and my song, and the postures—the
ERC'LEs a stranglin the Nºnmim Lion was, arter the 'Pollo, the special
favorite—the critters, jæ as if they was askin nothin, said they
should like to kiss me. Well, not having any fear—being sure they
wouldn’t bite—I said, “Very well, you critters; come along.” The
young and the pretty ones, if I must tell the truth, did not go aginst
the grain, by no means ; but it is a leetle too bad to be left to have
no choice. Well, they all, one arter the other, fell a kissin me ; and
the older they were, I do really believe the harder they kissed. I felt
my face a goin away—a meltin like a peach ; and I cried out, and
screeched; and at last was obligated to jump slick into BARNUM's
coat pocket ; and hold, I may say, a kinder parley like, afore I’d come
out. “I tell you what,” ses I, “I’ve no objection on airth to be
kissed; but then I do like to choose my own lips. Now it's mighty
cur'ous, but I ne'er could bear to be kissed by leetle gals in all my
life. No : I don't think kisses come to their full growth and flavour
till thirty—so here I am proud and happy to be kissed by any female
critter that is risin thirty-one.” You should have seen 'em : they all
hung behind in a minute; and nobody would from that minute beg
a kiss, 'xcept it was a pretty pussy critter that knew her lips, and
eyes, and roses in her cheeks made it kinder joke to be thought even
two-and-twenty. And after that fashion—for the first day—at least,
I was only kissed by the young and tender.
And so the first day was over ; and arter a time, I got home; well
nigh, I may say it, kissed off my legs. My face was skinned again—
(what the critters had to answer for l) and BARNUM went for SIR
BENJAMIN BRODIE, (he didn't live far from us,) and he recommended
a poultice of cold cream and rose-water outside ; with a mutton-chop
and a julep—for he said the American constitution required a julep—
a-goin to bed.
Well, next mornin, I rose like a giant clean shaved ; and went agin
private to the Hall. I must say it—it was beautiful to see BARNUM
with his ear a half-cock kinder listenin to the shillins droppin at the
door—as he would say, such a tarnation shower of silver ! And never
since this airth began, did any duck or goose—not that BARNUM's
either, not he quite as far from one as t'other—ever enjoy a shower
as BARNUM did them silver-drops.
Well, on the third day, I'd hardly got to the Hall, when BARNUM's
man comes runnin as if there was a ghost at the pay-place that
wanted to come in for nothin—but it wasn't: quite the contrary.
“What's the matter ?” ses BARNUM.
“The Dook of WELLINGTON's at the door,” cries the man.
“Is he 7 Then I'll go and talk to him—kinder gammonin him—
while you, like greased lightnin, dress the Gen'ral as NAPoleon. We
can do no less ; and the Dook will take it handsome.”
FOOD FOR MEN AND BIRDS.
THE proposal has been made to cut off the oats which are usually
given to horses, and make bread for men ; but there is another
consuming class which is allowed with impunity to take the food out
of the poor man's mouth. We allude to the hares and rabbits. Every
rabbit consumes a bushel of wheat—so says the calculation before us ;
robbing the farmer of his money and not benefiting the landlord. We
think, therefore, when there is not a mouthful of too much food to
spare, it would be as well to get rid of these epicurean rabbits, and
hares, and so increase the stock of provisions. It would be a delightful
item to read amongst the subscriptions to the Irish and Scotch
Destitute Fund :-
“The Abolition of the Game Laws . 2,000,000 bushels of wheat.”
It would be only a small addition (the bushel of wheat being six
shillings) of £600,000 | By the bye, what has become of the Game
Law Committee ? The members require starting a bit, for they do
nothing apparently but sit upon their forms.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OPENING OF THE OPERA.
HAT excitement, what bustle, what squeez-
ing, what crushing !
To the Opera every one seems to be
rushing.
No sooner the janitors open the doors,
Than into the house a vast multitude
pours.
At the door of the pit is the usual
squeeze :
Says one—“Take your heel off my toe,
if you please !”
While another exclaims, from a corner
remote,
“I’ll thank you to hand me the tail of
my coat.”
Some backwards, some forwards, some
sideways, are thrust ;
But somehow or other go onwards they must,
Till they find themselves pack'd, by a very close fit,
In the front, or the centre, or back of the pit.
Brimful is the house, and, as every one knows,
Expectation stands quite on the tip of its toes
To see what the manager brings in the stead
Of those who away from his standard have fled.
And first, on a scale comprehensively grand,
Before us is spread the new Opera Band:
A forest of fiddles, a thicket of basses,
A small grove of flutes, and a bed of grosses caisses;
A little plantation of trumpets and brass,
With serpents—but now not one snake in the grass.
What a splendid effect ' How delicious the twiddles
That come from the strings of those exquisite fiddles 1
And then how majestic, how soft, and how mellow,
The sound of that beautiful first violencello!
How deeply yet smoothly the notes seem to glide
From the thundering mouth of that huge ophycleide.
How soft the trombone ! how wondrously pat
It leaps all at once from the sharp to the flat.
That charming triangle! its sound makes us feel
There sometimes is soul in a bit of cold steel ;
And ah that magnificent drum how it soars
To the highest of notes in the highest of scores.
That sweet clarionet, how it gracefully gambles 1
From nat'ral to nat'ral it playfully rambles;
Now shrieking at A, and now moaning at F,
It touches, with ease, every note in the clef.
The curtain ascends—in procession before us
Pass a body of monks, who are singing a chorus.
The piece is the popular opera, The Favourite,
The plot has some strong situations to flavour it ;
But into particulars let us not go
Of what half the public by this time must know.
They’ve seen it with TEMPLEToN, and with DUPREz,
And with young MR. TRAVERs, of whom critics say
That he's destined to win operatical glory,
As our freshest and primest of primi tenori ;
With the heroine's part we completely at home are,
Through the aid of the Drury Lane favourite, Miss RonneR.
The plot it is needless again to repeat ;
How Fernando a lady is taken to meet,
THE
His badges of honour are marks of disgrace,
And smack they all go at the legs of the base.
Leonora, of course, to her Ferdinand clings,
At the hazard of tearing and rumbling her things;
Like a heroine plunged in the depths of despair,
She wildly gives loose to her grief and her hair;
'Tis always a mark of a sorrowful mind
When a heroine's back hair is all dangling behind.
Fernando re-enters the convent, and straight
A penitent female appears at the gate,
Of course it is wondrously easy to guess—
Leonora's the woman, in white and distress.
A deserted soprano their efforts ne'er cease,
The tenors can get not a moment of peace;
But such importunity can we regret
When it gives us a beautiful final duet,
Which, after a total exhaustion of force,
Will finish in death and forgiveness of course?
The tenor, GARDoN1, must rank with the best;
How precious the treasures locked up in his chest
Not e'en England's Bank if you came to inquire,
Contains in its chest any notes that are higher.
SUPERCHI and Bouche will soon be well known,
For they've each of them voices and styles of their own,
That render them worthy of taking the places
Of baritones best, and profoundest of bases.
MISTER LUMLEY, the manager, surely has reason
To be proud of the Opening Night of his Season.
The house fairly echoed with shoutings for LUMLEY,
Who bowed to his patrons in attitude comely:
And then to wind up, just by way of a closer,
Came calls for our principal English composer—
For BALFE, who pursuing the usual decencies,
Achieved some half-dozen most graceful obeisances.
The Ballet came after, with wondrous success,
But to say any more we can't now stop the press;
So we coolly make use of the common evasion,
By promising more on some future occasion.

WE understand that PRINCE ALBERT has becn solicited to allow him-
self to be put in nomination for the high and honourable office of
|Ranger of the park of Whetstone. His Royal Highness, from his know-
|ledge of all subjects, is considered the fittest person to preside over this
well-known park, and to defend its privileges against the rude hands of
| reformers. Whetstone Park was originally a manor or chase, and was
| so called from the determined manner in which chase was given to
those dishonest debtors who gave the name of Whetstone to the place,
in consequence of its making every blade when destitute of blunt a
sharper of the most penetrating description. The rangership has no
|emolument beyond the privilege of killing a buck; but as few bucks
resort to the park, this privilege is almost formal.
PRINCE ALBERT has likewise been offered the professorship of
Hebrew in the University of Hounsditch. It is true his Royal High-
ness dees not understand the language, but this will render him more
tolerant to those who are learning it.
It is rumoured that the square-keepership of Golden Square is to be

How he gets it, and hears a most horrible thing ;
How he's married, and thrown himself madly away

Oh, then what a terrible outburst ensues,
Fernando his monarch begins to abuse;
having three children; but as the Prince is in a position that will
enable him to put forth a placard inscribed “Vote for Albert and

predicted.

UNCH determined, in
consequence of the in-
terest excited by the trial
in France on this subject,
to lay a case before his
friend, MR. BRIEFLEss,
whose opinion is distin-
guished for those delight-
ful qualities which have
placed him at the top—
his chambers are on the
third floor—of his pro-
fession.
The following is theim-
portant document, which
will be read by the lawyer
and the litérateur with
equal interest :-
OPINION.
“I am of opinion, that
Monsi EUR DUMAs is not
exempt, on the score of
genius, from the fulfil-
ment of a legal contract;
for he might, on the same
plea, refuse to pay his
washerwoman; & though
geniusisoften exceedingly
irregular in the settle-
ment of pecuniary claims,
I think it would be dan-
- gerous to allow such a
quality to be regarded as a legal set-off to an action. There are, I
know, several cases in the books—I mean the tradesmen's books—to
show that poetry and punctuality in cash payments are incompatible ;
- but this doctrine has been since overruled by a more wholesome
| practice.
“I am further of opinion, that MossIEUR DUMAs is not exempt from
the obligation to fulfil his engagement because he has received some
money in advance, for though this has been the custom to a very great
extent, I do not think it is so invariable as to make it what is called a
good custom, for it has been interrupted occasionally—though I own
very rarely—within the time of what is termed legal memory.
| “I am strongly of opinion, that great allowances should be made for
| literary men, but it is rather too great an allowance to be allowed a
large sum without doing any work for it. -
“Upon the whole case I am of opinion, that Monsmeur DUMAs is en-
º titled to some consideration ; for the publishers, in making a contract
ſº with him to produce more than he was physically capable of bringing
| forth, entered into what may be called a nudum pactum, which is void
on the score of impossibility. I am aware it is the practice to regard
º the head of an author as a piece of machinery which may be constantly
worked without exhaustion; but I am nevertheless clearly of opinion,
that, such expectations being unreasonable, the publishers have no right
to demand their fulfilment. -
“On the whole, therefore, I am of opinion, that I can form no opinion
at all, which is perhaps the most strictly professional course that I can
follow. I certainly have no opinion of Mossieur DUMAs, after what
has occurred, and I need, I am sure, offer no opinion on the impropriety
of entering into a contract with a journal, and leaving the contract to
its own fulfilment.

ALEXANDRE DUMAs—His (LITERARY) creditors.
“J. BRIEFLESS.”
THE TEMPLE PORTERS.
It is said that two of a trade never agree ; but this odious maxim is completly controverted by
the delightful harmony that exists between the porters of the Temple. The two white-aproned and
pewter-badged functionaries who stand at the gate under HoxEY and SKELTON's, late HENRY VIII.
and Wolsey's, are more like brothers than opposition messengers. It is beautiful to watch the
harmony in which they pass their days. Nor does the approach of a customer occasion any
disturbance of the friendly relations existing between them. There is no indecent struggle for a letter,
no impetuous rush at a carpet bag, no violent plunge into the middle of a message, which is being
entrusted to one in the presence of the other. It would seem that the pewter badge subdues the heart-
burnings that might otherwise be in active operation beneath, and that the white apron is the emblem
of peacefulness.
We have often watched these friendly functionaries with the most earnest interest, and marked the
amiable intercourse which goes on between them, without the smallest touch of that envy and jealousy
| which acts like aqua fortis in corroding all the finer feelings of our nature. We are sure that an
Ode to Friendship might be inspired by a contemplation of the porters of the Temple, who, so far from
struggling to wrest from one another
the employment they are supposed to
seek, may be observed actually pre-
tending, with the utmost delicacy, not
to see the proffered parcel ; so that
the one to whom it is offered gives, as
it were, the refusal of the job to the
other.
There is something very touching in
this trait of brotherhood. We have
heard, alas !, a selfish interpretation
put upon this apparent disinterested-
ness. It is said they share all they
get, and consequently they both shirk
the work as much as possible. Oh not
we will not allow the charming illu-
sion to be dispelled so easily. We can-
not, we do not believe that there is an
understanding between the porters to
share the fees, and that the one who
does least gets the easiest life with
the same pay as his companion. For
the credit of human nature, and for
the honour of British porterhood, we

MR. BENTLEY has published a book
“with two portraits of the author.”
Hitherto authors have only done the
thing by halves; but we suppose the
two portraits are for the purpose of
giving the front and back view of the
author, as is done in giving the por-
trait of a large mansion ;-or was one
portrait done for the first edition, and
the other for the second 2 Perhaps

the author “on horse back,” whilst the

VERY great excitement has been produced at the “Corner” by the
sale of Lord GeoRGE BENTINck's steam stud, advertised to take place,
“as the noble owner is about to retire from the rail.” We were, of
course, on the spot, and are thus enabled to furnish a report of this
interesting sale.
1. Burster. A fast, narrow-gauge, long-boiler engine, got by Stephen-
son out of Experiment. It has been worked, during the last season, on
a North Line. Warranted safe, with a steady stoker, but apt to run
off the rails when extra steam is put on.
Burster, on being run up and down the yard a few times by MEssRs.
TATTERSALL's stoker, exhibited very perfect action, although some
knowing hands detected a tendency to “roaring.” Bought in.
Colonel's apprehensions.
2. Vesuvius, got by Dividend out of Economy. Aged. Has been
worked a short time on the North Midland Line.
Vesuvius, on being trotted out, looked anything but showy. Wind
evidently bad, and very great tendency to bolt. The stoker absolutely
refused to run him down without a safety-valve. Put up very cheap,
and bought for an “amalgamation line” for a trifle.
3. King Death, got by Erpress out of Recklessness. Well known as a
“queer customer.” Messrs. TATTERSALL did not attempt to disguise

from their customers that King Death was the well-known engine which
had already killed three stokers, four first-class passengers, and two-
thirds of a parliamentary train full. Temper said to be vicious, and a
screw loose in the boiler.
King Death on being run into the yard was at once pronounced “no
go.” Great difficulty was experienced in getting him to start. When
he did, he at first went off at a slapping pace, then stopped short, and

noble owner and breeder, at a very reckless figure, probably as a
“hedging” dodge. This lot hung very heavy on hand, and there seemed
no disposition to purchase. We cannot say anything of their per-
formances, but appearances were against them. It is a maxim on the
turf that “an Irish horse is a dark horse,” and we do not see any
reasons for excepting these specimens of LoRD GEORGE's Hibernian
“cross.”
The lot was ultimately withdrawn, no buyers being forthcoming.
THE LAST KICK OF BIGOTRY.
MR. WATson, last week, in the House of Commons, brought forward
a bill for repealing the remainder of the penal laws against the Roman
Catholics. SIR Robert INGL1s moved that it be read this day six
months, and the amendment was appropriately seconded by Colonel
SIBTHoRPE. It was, however, rejected; and Intolerance, we trust, has
kicked her last.
CoLoREL SIBTHoRPE, no doubt, seriously believes that the Roman
Catholics would, if they could, roast him alive in Smithfield. His
horror of Romanism is equal to his dread of railways; he regards its
professors as tigers and wolves, who, if they got him into their clutches,
would tear him in pieces. Sincerely entertaining these suppositions, of
course he votes for the maintenance of the penal laws against the
Catholics. Of course, also, he would enforce them.
Now, SIB Robert INGL1s can hardly participate in the gallant
He surely can be in no dread of Romish
fire and faggot. Nor does he desire that Catholics shall be imprisoned
or transported. He would not wish bigotry to use her rod; but it
seems that in his tenderness for the old creature he would not have her
deprived of the pleasure of holding it: he feels, we suppose, that there
is something comfortable in its grasp—a satisfaction in the conscious-
ness of the potentiality to use it: he cannot consent to yield that.
Poor gentleman We congratulate him on being seconded by the
member for Lincoln. Colonel SIBTHoRPE cries “ditto” to SIR Robert
INGLIS. Our Colonel is quite right.
Another Brew Constitution.
THE public will hear with universal satisfaction that the Beadle of
the Lowther Arcade has promised a Constitution to those who are
under his government. The staff is to be transferable in cases of mis-
conduct, and the protective system is to be abolished, by allowing boys
to go in and out free of duty; that is to say, whether they have any
business or not upon the premises. The inhabitants are to be allowed
the privilege of meeting each other half way with their goods, by
spreading them from side to side of the Arcade ; but the blockade is
not to interfere with the rights of neutrals to effect a passage. These
are some of the principal points in the Constitution, which has been
long looked for with intense interest.

WHAT MAKES MY HEART TO THRILL
SONG BY FITZROY CLARENCE.
AND GLOW 2
WINTER and summer, night and morn,
I languish at this table dark ;
My office window has a corn-
er looks into St. James's Park.
I hear the foot-guards' bugle horn,
Their tramp upon parade I mark;
I am a gentleman forlorn,
I am a Foreign-Office Clerk.
My toils, my pleasures, every one,
I find are stale, and dull, and slow ;
And yesterday, when work was done,
I felt myself so sad and low,
I could have seized a sentry's gun
My wearied brains out out to blow.
What is it makes my blood to run ?
What makes my heart to beat and glow
My notes of hand are burnt perhaps?
Some one has paid my tailor's bill ?
No : every morn the tailor raps;
My IOU’s are extant still.
I still am prey of debt and dun;
My elder brother's stout and well.
What is it makes my blood to run,
What makes my heart to glow and swell ?
I know my chief's distrust and hate ;
He says I’m lazy, and I shirk.
Ah I had I genius like the late
RIGHT Honour ABLE EDMUND BURRE.
My chance of all promotion's gone,
I know it is, he hates me so.
What is it makes my blood to run,
And all my heart to swell and glow 7
Why, why is all so bright and gay ?
There is no change, there is no cause;
My office-time I found to-day
Disgusting as it ever was.
At three, I went and tried the clubs,
And yawned and sauntered to and fro;
And now my heart jumps up and throbs,
Aud all my soul is in a glow.
At half-past four I had the cab;
I drove as hard as I could go.
The London sky was dirty drab,
And dirty brown the London snow.
And as I rattled in a cant-
er down by dear, old Bolton Row,
A something made my heart to pant,
And caused my cheek to flush and glow.
What could it be that made me find
Old JAwRINs pleasant at the club 2
Why was it that I laughed and grinned
At whist, although I lost the rub 2
What was it made me drink like mad
Thirteen small glasses of Curaço 2
That made my inmost heart so glad,
And every fibre thrill and glow 2
She's home again she's home, she's home !
Away all cares and griefs and pain;
I knew she would—she's back from Rome;
She's home again she's home again l

Since then my lonely heart is dead,

Among the other poetical associations which are being destroyed by
railways, must be ranked the annihilation of the trade of the brigand.
The traveller can no longer hope for the excitement of having a carbine
muzzle brought in contact with his own, or being carried off to the
“mountain home” of a band of bandits, until he obtains his ransom by
a cheque on RANsom's bank, or a draft Cotte qui Cotte on Courts's.
We understand that remonstrances are pouring in upon the Pope
from the depredating fraternity; and the following has, we hear, been
addressed to his Holiness by some modern Mazzaroni to the air of
**Gentle Zitella."

THE IDEA OF IRISH RAILWAYS |
"THE House of Commons has shown an unusual amount of common
sense in rejecting Lord George BENTINck's Irish Railway Bill. Our
senators, however, would have displayed much more of that quality, by
wasting considerably less discussion upon it. An obvious line of argu-
ment too, which common sense might have suggested against the
measure, was wholly overlooked by the House. It was urged, to be
sure, that commerce develops, instead of being developed by railways;
but the absurdity of the confusion of cause and effect, which formed
the basis of the whole scheme, was very insufficiently dwelt upon.
Nobody remarked on the singularity of the circumstance that a pro-
posal to put the cart before the horse should have emanated from a
stable mind. It was never observed that to give railroads to Ireland
would be doing her about as much good as sending her assiettes and
wine-coolers. The House did not bethink itself that it might as well
vote a side-pocket to a toad—a cradle to a Malthusian—as railways to
a country like Ireland.
Above all, the question was not asked, Who would everventure on
an Irish railway ? Where was Colonel Sibthoºrn 2 Even in Eng-
land, no prudent person will travel on any line intestate; and who, for
a moment, would dream of trusting his life and limbs upon an Irish
one 2 Irish railways! Why, who does not see that an Irish Great
Western would run due East—a Midland Counties along the coast 2
A passenger booked for Dublin would infallibly find himself at Cork.
Gradients would ascend the sides of mountains, turnings would be
made at angles of ninety; one portion of a double line would run
a substratum of bog; the guard would sit fronting the road side, en-
joying the view and his pipe; the whistle would never be sounded till
after a collision, on the principle of not crying out before you are hurt;
the coals would be put in the boiler, and the water underneath it ; and
when the train came to a standstill, the engineer would thrash the
engine with his shillelagh. If the Irish could afford to travel by them,
they would certainly reduce the population.
THE PROGRESS OF SONG.
ENGLAND may now dispute with Italy the claim to the title of the
|Land of Song, or rather may be regarded as peculiarly the Land of
| Sing-song. The million are undoubtedly music-mad; and we hope

public discourses will be delivered in recitative at least. Lectures will

THE civil war that is at present raging in the City has stopped

cannot believe that an alderman could be the slave of his appetite;
but if it is true that the Board is rebellious from being deprived of
its daily turtle, it will be easy for his lordship, instead of throwing
out the bill, to say at the next discussion, “Gentlemen, this bill will
be laid upon the dinner-table, and discussed this day three weeks;” and
then, if all animosity is removed with the table-cloth, it may be said

A SUGGESTION TO M. SOYER;
OR, THE TICKET FOR SOUP.
M. SoYER deserves to be called the Gastro-
nomic Regenerator of Ireland. His receipt for
cheap soup is the best practical suggestion
which has been yet made ior the relief of that
unlucky island. It has, however, been objected
against M. SoYER's soup, that it contains an
insufficient quantity of meat. We have a plan
to propose, by which this defect may be remedied.
Nay, we will show how animal matter may be
plentifully introduced into the soup with positive
gain instead of expense to the country. Let
game be applied to this purpose. We shall be
told that it will require all the game in the
kingdom. Exactly so. Two great savings will
thus be effected; one in crops to the agricultu-
rist, the other in prosecutions and prison-expen-
ses to counties. For if the Irish eat up the
game, the game will not eat up the farmer ;
poaching will be impossible, and the Game Laws
become a dead letter. We therefore, for once,
recommend a series of battues for the benefit of
the starving Irish. Let us not be told that
this is an unseasonable proposal. Famishing
people can eat stranger food than game out of
season. March hare will make very sensible
soup. Our scheme we know will spoil sport ;
but it is rather better to sacrifice that than
human life. Instead, therefore, of making game
of Soy ER's soup, we say, let SoYER's soup be
made of game. And the extirpation of game
by the iustrumentality of SoYER will add
appropriate lustre to a name associated with
Reform.
SPANISH MARRIAGES-SPANISH BLOOD.
MARRIAGE would, at times, seem to be like the scarlet fever; let it
only attack one, and it straight runs through a family. The Queen of
Spain is the first victim; and then immediately afterwards (not at the
same time, M. GUIzot) her little sister. Well, their affections being
placed, or said to be placed, upon respectable husbands—that is,
gentlemen with royal blood in their veins (the very best and brightest
let or hindrance BREsson, the great wedding-ring minister, speedily
nullifies. The girls are married, and there is an end. Well, poor Don
HENRY, finding himself attacked by the hymeneal fever, is desirous of
obtaining a remedy. Whereupon he is about to marry the young
now some three or four months a wife, with perhaps a new sympathy
for the young man on his impending misfortune—forbids the banns,
orders the prince to be popped into a post-chaise, and to travel to
“finish his naval education.” The young Countess is packed to a
husband. But there are great state reasons for this apparent tyranny.
cementing the Spanish Constitution. For it is not permitted to royal
blood to wed with the sangre azul, the blue blood of even the grandees
and best nobility.
There is much noise about blood in Spain. According to Mr. Ford,
the blue blood animates the true nobility; the real fluid, the poor
gentleman and younger brothers. “Those Peninsular ladies,” says
MR. Ford, “who are blues, by blood, not socks, are equally fastidious,
in the serious matter of its admixture even by Hymen ; one of them,
it is said, having chanced in a moment of weakness to mingle her
azure with something brownish, alleged in excuse, that she had done --
so for her character's sake. “What nonsense !' was the reply. . “Why
ten"living mishaps would have less discoloured your blood, than one
legitimate baby born of such a misalliance " " Hence, Spain being
very precise in the article of blood—though, by the way, she is apt to
be more than sufficiently liberal of it—will insist upon keeping the
royal fluid particularly pure. This is a pity; for, considering what
poor wishy-washy stuff it has become, very certain we are, that there
is much blood in Spain that would very well bear the recommendation
set forth at our own juniper palaces, and be “remarkably good for
mixing.”
The CoNDE DE Most Emolis—(King of Spain, according to the
Grace of the Morning Post)—is, like the rest of the royal family,
determined upon marriage; and, says L'Union Monarchique, has fixed
his eye upon our little PRINcess MARY, daughter of the DUKE of
CAMI Ridge. And then, coolly adds L'Union, “the only obstacle is the
difference of creeds: but it is said that this will be removed by the
Princess becoming a Catholic! ”. Rather too great, a sacrifice this, to
demand of the young lady ; we think that L'Union might have
suggested that each party should make one step towards mutual
accommodation.
Thus, instead of the Princess becoming wholly a Catholic, both her-
self and the Count should turn Puseyites. The Princess would only
have to take a step in advance, and the Prince one step back, and
this would bring both on the same line.

I, ITER AT UIREH,
MATILDA OF HUNGARY : a Grand Opera, in Three Acts. By ALFRED
BUNN, Esq., Author of “Hollow Hearts,” “Marble Halls,”“Woman's
Heart,” “Other Lips,” dºc., dºc.
ſº
J/5 A
NOTHER and another ” of the libretti of the
Poet BUNN “still succeeds,” each surpassing
its predecessor in those points for which
notre cher gāteau is eminent. Matilda of
Hungary, his last—or rather we must, we
fear, say his latest work—commences with
a chorus of Bohemian girls—no relations,
we believe, of the original old Bohemian girl
who “dream't that she dwelt”—all request-
ing protection for their “Queen, in danger's
darkest scene,” the “darkest scene" being
beautifully contrived by the lowering of the
foot-lights. It appears that a revolution
is going on behind the scenes, which is
contrived in the usual manner by sundry
murmurs of “follow, follow, follow,” the
striking of an occasional gong, and the
shaking of sheet-iron. The revolutionists,
in the most accommodating manner, “hold
their noise” all of a sudden, when an inn-
keeper comes in to explain to the Bohemian
girls, that one day, in a war with the Otto-
mans, KING LADIslaus I. “got wedged in,
and from that fatal moment has never been
heard of.” It seems his subjects lived in
the hope that their sovereign had only been
knocked into next week, and were always
expecting to see him again; but as next
week never comes, they were always doomed
to disappointment.
: It appears that a ballad has been written
on the subject—for Bohemia as well as
Chelsea has its BUNNs—and the peasantry
ask the innkeeper to sing it, promising to
join him in the chorus if he will give them
some wine. He replies, “Willingly,” which
proves that the Bohemian landlords are
very musically inclined, for they will go so
far as to serve out wine gratuitously to a
room-full of guests, on condition of their
joining in the refrain of one of his vocal
efforts.
The ballad is in the Poet's usual style,
pledging him to nothing in particular; for
when we have read the whole of it we can-
not tax him with having asserted anything
whatever. The innkeeper having got rid
of his unprofitable customers, is visited by
George Podiebrad—a corruption of the word
Point-de-brads—a man without brads, or
money. He is a poor man, with a good edu-
cation picked up in a Moravian convent, of
which his father was hall porter, and he
gains a livelihood by his bow, so that with-
out great care he is likely to overshoot the
mark in his expenditure.
A beautiful conversation then ensues
between the two friends, who tell each other
what both are well acquainted with—for it
is the charming simplicity of the dramatic
character to indulge in superfluous gossip. Podiebrad at length bursts
into a ballad of surpassing tenderness, the preliminary recitative of
which reminds us of the Poet of Moses, in his happiest moments.
It begins—
“One day I wandered far away,
As deer is known to browse or stray."
How forcibly this brings back to us the celebrated lines in the last
new poem of Costume Castle—
“How pleasant 'tis to wear a coat
In winter, buttoned to the throat."
The recitative is, however, nothing to the ballad which follows.
“It was a form so finely wrought,
(What was, eh, BUNN ?)
A look though pale so fair,
(Paleness and fairness are by no means incompatible, friend Poet.)
It seemed that lavish Nature brought
Her choicest treasures there.”
(The idea of Nature acting as a sort of a Parcels' Delivery of her own
treasures is superb and business-like.)
**To gaze upon her beauty's beam,
In hope its light to share,
Though less than fancy fain would dream,
Is more than it would dare.”
We have been so inspired by the delicacy and freshness of this senti-
ment that we have been emboldened to offer a slight imitation of it.
Its dreamy beauty is so vague and evanescent that we know of nothing
to equal it but this:—
“Though one and one can make but two,
While there is one to share;
The joys that other days renew,
Are more than all would dare.”
But let us turn from the lighter graces of poesy to the more sterling
matter of political reflection with which this great work abounds. The
Queen of Bohemia is persecuted by a minister, one Magnus, in a
mask and ermine cuffs on his highlows, and everything ermine
about him, to denote his desire to und-ermine the throne of his
sovereign. His political observations are marked by the keen-
est sagacity: he observes, among other matters, that “the hand
of a woman cannot govern Bohemia,” and adds with much acute-
ness, that “it requires a firmer one to put down party spirit.” He
offers himself as a husband to the Queen, who is seen by George Point-
de-Brads, and recognised as the identical “beauty's beam,” “idol there
it met,” “light he hoped to share,” &c., whom he rescued from the
back of a frisking pony in the mountains of Moravia. Magnus, the
minister, seeing in him a likeness to the king, requests Point-de-Brads to
remain and personate the monarch, which the latter consents to do ;
observing, with much point and pathos, that “Destiny leads him on ; ”
but surely Destiny never required of him to sing the ballad into which
he bursts immediately afterwards. It is something after the following
fashion :- -
“Adieu, fair land! the hamlet, too,
Where out, in youth, I hung;
Commanding that extensive view
I loved when I was young.
If fate turns out the gas of life,
Or turns it on, to shine
"Mid other scenes, away from strife,
To beam again on thine.
“I leave the mountains; yes, I go
To seek another air;
The country lies extremely low,
'Tis not so healthy there.
Yet, dark or light, or blue or green,
Orbistre, or carmine—
You know exactly what I mean–
To beam again on thine.”
It will be seen that the burden, the delicious
“beam again on thine,”
is the only part of this ballad upon which the Poet seems to set any
value. Burden is everything in a sentimental song, and not even PICK-
. would wish a heavier burden than a modern libretto would supply
to him.
This touching composition finishes the first scene, which, we think,
is about as large a dose as we can, at one time, safely administer. We

Whether it has extended to the watches we don't know ;

THE CLOCK EPIDEMIC.
The first that attracted any considerable notice, was that of St.
Clement's, which, our readers will remember, was seized with paralysis in
the hands, which lasted for a very considerable period. The next public
clock that became very bad, was that at Hyde Park Corner, which,
after having “a light in its laughing eye” very punctually, for a long
period, was suddenly obscured, and exhibited all the incipient eigns of
total blindness.
We, however, always expect something wrong with these clocks that
are up all night ; and we are never surprised, therefore, when we find
them going wrong ; which must be the consequence of a clock's keeping
irregular hours. The Hyde Park Corner horloge has had one or two
opportunities of becoming respectable, but it has soon gone back again
to its old and irregular pastime. We fear, moreover, that this unhappy
dial has set a bad example to its neighbour at the Hyde Park turnpike,

The poor thing counted eight very incoherently about a

it has become suddenly deprived of the power of repeating its
customary warnings to the surrounding neighbourhood.
THE CAMBRIDGE ADDRESS TO PRINCE ALBERT.
We have received a version of the above document, freely rendered
into English by a gentleman of the name of GYP, of Trinity College,
STERN fate hath clipped, with cruel shear,
In spite of all physick,
A worthy duke, a noble peer,
To virtue and to Cambridge dear,
(Says REveREND MR. CRICK.)
He ruled us but for seven short year,
His death was all too quick;
We howl, and drop the briny tear
Upon his lamentable bier,
(Says REVEREND MR. CRICK.)
About his venerated dust,
Our tear-drops tumble thick;
He was our champion kind and just,
In him was all our hope and trust,
(Says REveREND MR. CRick.)
But weep and blubber though we must,
For this of dukes the pick,
We must not cry until we bust—
Such conduct would inspire disgust,
(Says REveREND MR. CRick.)
My GRANTA 1 wipe your weeping face,
And be philosophick ;
Look round and see can we replace
In any way his poor dear Grace,
(Says REveREND MR. CRICK.)
Who is the man to meet our case ?
Who enters in the nick,
To take Northumbria's vacant mace
There is a gent of royal race,
(Says REveREND MR. CRick.)
There is a gent of royal breed,
There is a princely brick,
Who doth on every virtue feed,
As wise in thought as great in deed;
To him we'll fly, (says CRICK.)
O Prince 1 come succour at our need,
This body politic;
Heal up our wounds, which gape and bleed;
Prevent us running quite to seed,
(Cries REvEREND MR. CRICK.)
On thee our hopes and faith we pin;
Without thee, ruined slick;
To thee we kneel with humble shin;
Stand by us, guide us, hem usin,
Great Prince 1 (cries MR. CRICK.)
Thou bright exemplar of all Prin-
ces, here your shoes we lick;
Kings first endowed us with their tin,
Why mayn't we hope for kings agin?
(Says independent CRICK.)
Our tree is of an ancient root,
And straightway perpendic-
ular to heaven its boughs will shoot,
If you but listen to our suit,
(Says REveREND MR. CRick.)
We grovel at your royal boot;
Ah! don't in anger kick,
Great Prince 1 the suppliants at your foot,
See how our lips cling fondly to't,
(Cries that true Briton, CRICK.)
From faction's sacrilegious claws
Keep Church and Bishopric;
Support our academic cause ;
Uphold our rights; defend our laws,
(Ejaculated CRICK.)
The speech was done. He made a pause
For ALBERT and for Vic ;
Three most vociferous huzzaws
Then broke from mighty WHEwell's jaws,
Who, as a proof of his applause,
Straight to the buttery goes and draws
A pint of ale for CRick.

DUMAS, MARQUIS DE POLTRONNERIE.
Poor Marquis I Poor DUMAs His ink-bottle being cracked by
the wits of Paris—his pen cut to a cure-dent by the ridicule of his
loving countrymen—he would now dip his sword in gore, and write
himself up in blood. In the Chamber of Deputies, a little time ago,
the MARQUIs DE MALLEville chatted about the steamer granted for
the use of DUMAs; and, how he ever compressed his dignity into one
vessel—how it was he did not sail in two at one time, we cannot
comprehend. Well, DUMAs swallowed the words of DE MALLEville,
but could not digest them. They still lay upon his mighty heart, like
too much hard dumpling in the stomach of a child. However, he was
too busy defending himself from the base attempts made upon him in sallied forth in our full suit of
a court of law—attempts to compel him, most ignominiously, to do sables, skates in hand, for the Ser-
work from which he was entirely exonerated, having beforehand received pentine, to enjoy the healthful re-

his honour. Then, too, there was his new theatre; the dramatic art that spirit of philosophy which

some three weeks ago; and at this moment there are many shops in
Paris with the shutters still up ; the owners of those shops having
been part of the audience, and not yet recovered from their weary
sleep. This, however, by the way.
M. DUMAs finding himself, one morning, “free from all business”—
he had, to be sure, to write twelve separate feuilletons, and his horses
were “pawing the ground" for them to bear them to Paris—finding
himself thus free, he writes to M. DE MALLEville the following
letter :— º
“Sir, You insulted me the other day in the Chamber of Deputies. Free to-day
from all business engagements, I send to you my friend, M. Viennet, Peer of France,
President of the Society of Men of Letters, to learn the day, the place and the hour,
when it may be convenient for us to cut one another's throats—(in his own graphic
French, ou il vous convicnt que mous mous couperons la gorge.)

However, M. DE MALLEville is, evidently, a man without the least
touch of honourable condition ; he would not be immortalised on the
edge of DUMAs's sabre.

But we were not aware that the executioner of Paris was a Peer of

SAMson, not VIENNET. Clearly, we have been all along in a mistake.
Nay, it will not serve to tell us, that there is no error in the matter;
and that VIENNET, the second of DUMAs in this affair, is really a Peer,
and not a bourreau ; for we are convinced that such a letter—such an
invitation to cut throats, could not be borne by a gentleman—but

Prime Guillotinist himself.
Panic among the Maids.
SINCE the debate in which the condition of the soldier made so inte-
resting an episode took place, there has been a general panic throughout
the kitchens, nay the nurseries of the metropolis. MR. Sidney
HERBERT (seconded now by Fox MAULF) having resolved to educate,
elevate, soften, and refine the tastes and habits of the common soldier,
it is much feared by the humbler female domestics that they will cease
to have that hold upon his affections which they now possess by means
of their masters' mutton—his legs and shoulders—and their own wages,
for beer and tobacco. It is despairingly predicted that in a little time

conferred upon him (and which upon that account he had before de-
clined), proves that, since he has swallowed his statements, he has at
all events “eaten his terms.”

journalists of France study the political horizon, and tell their readers
what there is in the wind. It would be strange if the London papers
a list published of all the persons who called, in the course of the
day, at the French Ambassador's, and prophesied immense things
from their visits. The result would be in every way as absurd as the
following:—
“A man with a paper cap called on Tuesday at the CoMTE DE Sr.
AULAIRE's, as early as nine o'clock. He left a small parcel, and stated
he would call the following day for an answer. This parcel was opened,
and was found to contain a box of wafers and sealing-wax. This suspi-
cious circumstance leaves no doubt he is an emissary of the English
Cabinet, who wishes to impress upon the French Ambassador the expe-
diency of closing and sealing, with the greatest secrecy, the negotiation
that is at present open between the Courts of St. James and the
Tuileries.”—Times.
“An influential wine-merchant in the City had no less than three
audiences with the French Ambassador on Saturday last. We have
been told, on the best authority—and we stake our reputation upon the
fact—that it is the intention of the French Embassy at the next
dinner-party to go deeply into the question of opening the ports.”—
Morning Herald.
“Mr. PETER Borthwick dined at Ashburnham House yesterday.
This is a sufficient contradiction to the democratic rumours that there
is a rupture between the French and English Courts. The above fact
will prove that the alliance was never, at any period, so strong.”—
Morning Advertiser.
“RAMo SAMEE was not invited to the soirée
given, last night, by the CoMTE DE ST.
AULAIRE. This affront to the Porte is too
glaring to be overlooked. The Turkish Am-
bassador, who had just been calling at Ash-
burnham House, ordered his carriage to turn
back as soon as he was told of this circum-
stance, and insisted upon having his card
returned to him. The funds have fallen
at Stamboul.”—Daily News.
“Lord John Russell attended the performances at the French
Plays last Monday evening, when Robert Macaire was performed. The
CoMTE DE St. AulaſRE, feeling this was an allu-
sion to his royal master too gross to be passed
LoRD
John, however, has written an autograph letter
to Louis-PHILIPPE, containing the most satis-
factory apology for this apparent outrage, and
the Comte has nobly consented to retain the
appointment he has so long filled with such
honour to himself and country.”— Morning
Chronicle.
How the Débats, Presse, Siècle, National, Charivari, and the other
anglophobian journals, would laugh at our papers if they indulged
in such ridiculous nonsense; and yet their comments upon English
diplomacy are almost as absurd as the above. We wonder they do not
establish a quarantine round the English Ambassador's, and examine
anything and everybody on entering and leaving it. They would be
able, by opening every basket and portefeuille that went into the hotel,
to get to the bottom of manythings of which they do not at present
see more than the surface, and the plague which the English Embassy
has lately been to Mossieua Guizot and his policy might cease,
before either of them have fallen victims to it.

AN INDIGNANT OLD GENTLEMAN.
“To MR. PUNCH,
“SIR,-My name frequently appears in the newspapers. I am
a true Briton, one who venerates our good old institutions, which the
besom of sentimentalism is threatening to sweep away. I am one of
those who would have fellows who deserve to be hanged, hanged. Now,
| Sir, I perceive by the papers that a lad of twelve was tried the other
day at the Central Criminal Court for robbing his master of four
| pounds twelve shillings. His master, Sir ; mark that. Imagine your-
self that master. Now, Sir, what was the boy's punishment * Sir, he
was liberated—actually let off—on a gentleman being bound for his
good behaviour for a twelvemonth.
“The RecordER said, that “by thus dealing with the lad, he might
|become an honest member of society; by sending him to prison, he
might become an expert thief.” Become an honest member of society
by not being punished when found out 1 Monstrous ! Become an
expert thief by being sent to prison: Did not the wisdom of our an-
cestors devise prisons expressly to teach people not to be thieves I
am aware that there are some objections to sending children to gaols.
Evil communications, I know, will not only corrupt good manners, but
also make bad manners worse. But could nothing have been done to
this lad to teach him not to steal another time? Could he not, Sir,
have been whipped a little, or something of that sort 2 That, at least,
would have been some satisfaction to the feelings of his wronged
employer; as it would have been to those, if in his place, of
“FLAT JUSTITL.A.”
HINTS TO AMATEURS OF ART.
We have perceived among the amateurs of art at the public Exhibi-
tions, a growing practice of turning the back upon some of the best
pictures. We believe this is done out of no disrespect to the painter,
but for the purpose of discussing the merits of the painting with greater
convenience. It has not, however, occurred to these connoisseurs, that
their tergiversation, when it becomes continuous, has the effect of
obscuring the work upon which the evolution alluded to is practised.
We recommend that blank squares of canvas should be prepared for
those who are in the habit of remaining long with their backs to the
wall in one position.

THE PRINCE CHANCELLOR.
It is predicted in certain quarters, that PRINCE ALBERT
will at last burst into scholastic bloom, making a very file
show at Cambridge—a little later, certainly, than the tulip
season—some time about June. He has already given himself
up, heart and soul, to the severer duties of his new dignity;
having, within the past week, dismissed eight artists, to whom
he was engaged to sit for eight separate Field-Marshals. He
has also-(at least, such is the report)—written a farewell
Ode to his dogs and fowling-pieces; and ordered a very con-
siderable thinning of the game in all the preserves. The
Prince further proposes to take lodgings at Cambridge ; and
to immediately enter the little princes as, certainly, under-
sizers. Having himself felt the benefits of a University
education, he purposes to break through the royal ice of
England, and bestow on his sons the like blessing.
Tremendous Iseap.
Amongst the various accomplishments of PRINCE ALBERT,
it was not generally known he could jump particularly high :
but the tremendous leap he has lately taken at Cambridge, in
jumping over the heads of every one in England–even those
who stood the highest—has convinced the most sceptical that
there is no height in the world which His Royal Highness will
not ultimately get over. The next leap of PRINCE ALBERT
will be, it is said, to clear the Horse Guards; but it is not cer-
tain whether he will attempt this daring feat at present, as
he wishes first to see which way the cat jumps.

AN EXTENSIVE SLIP.
An extensive slip has occurred at SHAKspeARE's Cliff, which
seems to be gradually breaking up its establishment, and leav-
ing England in disgust. This may be in consequence of the
little hold ShakspeaRE has lately had upon his native
country; and the Cliff, probably, is only crossing the Channel to
seek a home in more congenial lands. Whither will it go to ?
Will it settle on the French coast, or sail direct for New York?
It would be curious to find SHAKspEARE's Cliff at Calais,
with a board stuck up, “Removed from over the way.” We
are confident that SHARspEARE himself would be thought all |
the more of, if he had a firm footing in France, and that his
Drama and his Cliff would rise much higher in the public
estimation when pieces of it could be taken from the French.
PARLIAMENTARY ACOUSTICS.
IT appears that the Houses of Parliament have been constructed
with such a beautiful regard to the science of Acoustics that it will be
necessary for the speakers to regulate their voices in conformity with
the principles of harmony. Peers speaking from one side of the House
will be compelled to speak in a different key from that adopted by the
members on the side opposite, and it will require that the Lord CHAN-
CELLoR should put forth the regular ut de poitrine when he is desirous
of having his cry for “order” distinctly heard all over the building.
The bench set apart for the Ministers is so situated that its occupants
must always talk in four flats, and the opposition Peers must, from
their position, begin with a B sharp when calling on any member of the
Government. One advantage of the new system is, that politicians in
Parliament will be able to make, without discord, those abrupt changes
of note which have hitherto been so destructive to harmony.
It is hoped that eventually an entire debate may be set to music, and
thrown into the form of an opera. The following specimen of a political
duet between Lords BRough AM and CAMPBell will furnish some idea
of the arrangement that might be entered into for the purpose of taking
full advantage of the acoustic ingenuity of the architect. A duet
between Lords BRough AM and CAMPBELL would assuredly have all the
interest of the celebrated Suomi la tromba in the hands—or rather in the
| mouths—of a stentorian bass and tremendous baritone.

“I say, JIM, vich do you give the Paufferance? Eugene Shue on
HALExaxDea DuMas?”
£iqugfacijing for tije ſtillion.
A PopULAR perruquier at the East End of the Town has made
arrangements for the supply, on an extensive and elaborate scale, of
Moustachios for the Million. The great demand for these articles by
the inmates of the Queen's Bench Prison, the swell mob, and other
numerous classes of our fellow-creatures, has rendered it necessary
that efforts should be made to throw into the market a cheap and
effective moustachio at a moderate figure. We understand that by a
new process a good dog's-hair article can be put in, with “glutinous
wash” complete, for adhesion, at one-and-fourpence, while a tip of
superior cat may be added for the extra twopence; and thus an appear-
ance equal to that of any Lieutenant in the “Horse Guards blew."
may be produced at a low price at the shortest notice. A suit of
| inferior rabbit's-hair, equivalent to a commission in a less distinguished
cavalry regiment, may be had for a shilling. It is intended to open a
Grand Imperial and Moustachio Mart at the end of the Quadrant,
for the convenience of mercantile and other gentlemen desirous of an
afternoon's stroll; and cigars, with a piece of tinfoil at the end—for
the benefit of those who are willing but wholly unable to smoke—may
also be procured by the day or hour.
Prince Albert for Lord Mayor.
| We understand it is in contemplation to offer the Lord Mayoralty of
London to PRINCE ALBERT on the next vacancy. Measures will be
taken to secure him an Aldermanic gown, which he will no doubt grace
as much as he has already done the gown of a Bencher, with which
the Society of Lincoln’s-Inn–charmed by his legal erudition—some
time ago invested him. His Royal Highness is now in training-upon
turtle—for the civic honours that are in store for him. He occasionally
practises in the Royal Mews with the state carriage, in which he is
drawn round and round the stable-yard, as a preliminary to the rides

ELEVATION OF THE ARMY.
THE Army is to be made very popular in England. To “pipeclay
and turn-out” will—predicts Mr. Fox MAULE—be considered an
honourable profession by the great body of the people. The Army
will not be a timely refuge from gaols—a hope “for the outcasts of
society”—but will afford a high social position for the lucky holder.
In the first place, the soldiers are to have libraries; they are to be
taught, upon principle, the humanising tendency of ramming down
hall-cartridge. They are to make war upon a much higher philosophy
than has ever yet been attained-charging bayonets with a more ele-
vated feeling, and burning and sacking a city with a refined gentleness
hitherto all unknown in the ranks. This is delightful to consider.
MARs will henceforth conduct his balls with an etiquette that distin-
guishes the balls of WEIPPERT. We, however, have our doubts of the
successful issue of the experiment. Though we certainly do not object
For in proportion as
you make the man think, you lose the mere soldier. Teach him to
look upon himself as a machine—and do teach him so, by all means—
and he will begin to question the utility, the moral lawfulness of its ap-
plication. When men are well used to thumb books, they will care less
to handle muskets.
THE ADAM OF THE POLITICAL ECONOMIST.
Mr. BRoth ERtoN has made a statement in the Commons that glori-
He has worked as a factory-boy; like
Uncle Toby's negro girl, he has suffered persecution and learnt mercy.
He, therefore, speaks manfully for the Ten Hours Bill, asking “Shall
we lay it down that to eat, to drink, to work, and to die only, shall be
the lot of a large portion of our fellow men?” And SIRJAMEs GRAHAM

its frame, fire for its food, and steam for its breath—an Apam that

º
| of Old England, and to successfully “compete with theforeigner.” And
yet, with a waggish benevolence, they talk of sending this engine ADAM
over-hours to school, and have already opened parks for his ease and
pleasant contemplation.
DISTRESSED FOREIGNERS.
WE recommend to any charitable association the following cases of
foreigners whose distress is extreme:- -
1. His MAJEsty Louis PHILIPPE, King of the French, who is in great
distress about the Duchess of MoxTPENSIER's apamage.
2. The Spanish and Portuguese nations at large, which are sadly
distressed for want of governments; and have not tasted tranquillity
for years.
3. The ConDE DE MonTEMoLIN, who wants somebody to help him to
a crown.
4. Nicholas, EMPERoR of Russia, sadly destitute of common hu-
manity.
5. BRoth ER Jonathan, embroiled with Mexico, and at a loss for
means to carry on the war.
The clerical Churn.
This is a new invention, just patented,—and said to be the great
brain-work of Doctor WHEwell. By the Clerical Churn, as recently
tested, any amount may be made, and that too in any time, of Cam-
bridge butter. All the lumps, when made, may be distinguished from
the common sort, by the stamp they carry, namely, that of a mitre.
The article, as produced by the patent churn, will, it is expected, be in
great request among gentlemen of the cloth, as they are unanimous in
the opinion that bread can never be so palatable as whenbuttered with
a mitre.
A World IN DISTINGUISHED EARS.
THE Court and Aristocracy are anticipating a high treat from the
warblings of the Swedish Nightingale. Can they not bestow a little of
their patronage upon the British Bulfinch *

REVOLUTION AT MUNICH.-BEAUTY'S BULL-DOG.
UR Bavarian Correspondent
has sent us the following
account.—“LoLA MonTEs,
own sister we believe to the
matador Montes, walks
about Munich with a bull-
dog. Both parties have of
late created some disturb-
ance; we mean both the dog
and the dog's lady. LoLA's
dog having a slight alterca-
cation with the horses of a
carman, the man remarked
thereon. At the word, LoLA
|||—not having, as we suppose,
| her dagger about her—at-
tacked him with her um-
brella. She then took refuge
in a chemist's shop, and the
mob assailed the house,
calling upon the chemist to give up both the dog and the—the lady.
| The door was barred, and in a few minutes Lola was seen with her
faithful dog at the first-floor window ; LoLA holding a quart-bottle in
her hand, labelled “poison, and intimating that she would drink rather
than surrender. The king, hearing of her danger, in his devotion to the
arts ordered out the garrison, and with very little bloodshed the lady was
rescued, returning to the palace, seated on a brass field-piece, the band
playing ‘We’ll not go home till morning.’”
[Further Particulars.]
“Eight o'clock. The populace have taken heart, led on by the insulted
carman. At this moment (for I write with everything passing under
my eyes and coming into my ears) they demand the head of LoLA
MostEs. This is stoutly refused by the king ; but a flag of truce has
issued from the gates, offering in place of her head the lady's dancing
slippers. The faithful bull-dog has just been captured by a patriotic
| pork and sausage-man, and hurried off to his own shop. The animal
will, no doubt, re-appear, like his mistress, in several pieces.”
[Latest Particulars.]
“DoNNA LoLA MonTEs in the centre of a solid square of cavalry, has
just been escorted to an unknown castle. The ministers have insisted
upon the measure. It is, however, believed that the favourite carries
with her the crown of Bavaria in a bonnet-box, with the whole of the
treasury in her reticule.”
[Still Later Particulars..]
“I regret to write that the King is alarmingly indisposed. There is
some talk of issuing a writ de lunatico. All yesterday he insisted upon
| believing himself a Spanish fly, and did nothing but buzz. To-day, the
humour is changed, and he has strongly declared that his head is
turned to a pair of castanets; and he does nothing but dance to his
Own Inuslc.

MYRMIDONS OF THE MINT.
THE authorities of the Mint, it appears, are in the habit of allowing
the policemen employed by them a large remuneration in addition to
their regular stipend. This, of course, operates as a premium on the
apprehension of coiners. The Mint authorities.remind us of certain
farmers, who allow the village boys the sum of one farthing for the head
of every sparrow that they produce ; the sparrow thus having a price
set upon its head as a depredator—a feathered rogue in grain. By this
expedient many sparrows are destroyed, but also not a few linnets and
yellow-hammers, whose innocent heads, by a little management, may

a corresponding temptation, the metropolitan policemen may not some-
times play a similar trick 7 May not a few unoffending heads have
occasionally been sacrificed to the Mint 2 If there is any such phreno-
logical organ as Detectiveness, we fear that the Mint must render it a
great deal too active.
Finality.
LoRD John tells us that the Reform Bill has arrived at a state of
Finality. There are many other things which resemble Reform, and
stand in as much need of it. There is the NELson Column, which has
arrived at a state of finality, for not a stone of it has been turned
since we have thrown so many at it. There is the Income-Tax, the
finality of which seems to be, thanks to Ireland, just as positive as:
that of the NELsoN Column; for though it was to have been finished
at the end of three years, we are afraid it will be left standing for
future ages to point at as a monument that ought to have been finished
and cleared away long ago. The only thing which does not seem to
have reached a state of finality, is the National Debt. It seems,
directly the Whigs come into power, as if there never would be an end
to it.
NATURE AND ART
MAJoR BENIowski, a Pole, who is celebrated for a new system of
artificial memory, has been brought up on a charge of violent assault.
We are afraid the Major's system of memory must be very artificial
indeed, if it allows him so easily to forget himself.
HUMANITY OF ST. STEPHEN’S.
PARLIAMENT appears disposed to mitigate, in some measure, the
punishment to which poverty is liable. Poor operatives, when the
Factory Bill has passed, will only have eleven hours on the mill.
THE GENERAL FAst.—One blessing must, at least, come of this fast;
namely, that if Messrs. Spooner and PLUMPTRE act up to their prin-
ciples, they must—for one day at least—keep their mouths shut.

CURIOSITIES OF ETON LITERATURE.
ow and then there issues
from Eton, and bursts upon
the astonished world, a piece
of English composition that
would put BLAIR to the
blush, and cause LINDLEY
MURRAY to bury his head
able little treatise. The Head
Master of Eton and the Pro-
vost have recently laid their
heads together for the pro-
duction of the following
mysterious paragraph. What
BUNN does for his mother-
tongue in poetry, Hodgson
and HAwTREY seem am-
bitious of accomplishing in
prose ; as the following
grammarless gush, apropos
of the abolition of Montem
at Eton, will testify —
“The Provost and Head-Master
of Eton feel it incumbent on them
to apprise Etonians, and those in-
terested in the welfare of Eton,
that the abolition of Montem has
been erroneously represented to be
still an open question. That cus-
tom was abolished in January last
by the Provost of Eton, in entire
concurrence with the Head-Master,
when HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
had graciously left to their sole
responsibility the decision of a
question upon which they had fully
made up their minds, after the strongest conviction that the evils attendant on Montem were irremediable, and much too
serious to admit of a continuance of that custom.—F. Hodgson, Provost. C. HAwTREY, Master. The Lodge, Eton College,
| March 5, 1847.”
Now, it has been hitherto our custom to offer a reward and a free pardon to any one who will
discover the sense of a mysterious sentence, and bring it home to conviction; but here is a case in
which it would be madness to ask for an impossibility, which we should do if we were seriously to
advertise for the sense of this paragraph. It is a Poor Removal Act in miniature; an abortion,
in which head and tail are equally deficient. It is not a mere instance of cart before the horse,
but of no horse, no cart, and—in a word—no nothing.
After stating that “the abolition of Montem has been erroneously represented to be still an open
question,” the Head-Master and provost proceed to say that “that custom was abolished in January
last.” Now, it is as clear as the November fog, at noon-day, that “that custom" is the custom
of “erroneously representing the abolition of Montem to be an open question.” It is the last thing
spoken of, and can be the only thing referred to as “that custom.”
We are then informed that “HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN had graciously left to their sole
responsibility the decision of a question upon which they had fully made up their minds after
the strongest conviction.” We see nothing particularly gracious in leaving a “sole responsibility”
upon two unfortunates, who would gladly have shifted the said responsibility on to HER MAJEsty,
who showed her sense, at all events, in getting rid of the burden. After all, the royal permission
only extended to allowing them “the decision of a question upon which they had fully made up
their minds,” and which of course, therefore, they had decided already. It seems, also, that they had
only “fully made up their minds after the strongest conviction;” so that conviction does not
necessarily mean that their minds are made up ; or, in other words, they may be convinced of a
thing being right, and yet yield their minds to the opposite. This shows a spirit of compliance
more accommodating than dignified.
We have compared the prose style of MEssRs. Hodgson and HAwTREY to the poetic manner of
BUNN, and we think, by the following proof how easily one might be substituted for the other, the
comparison will be justified :-
When those who Eton fondly love, |
When her fair Majesty the QUEEN
Shall look with other eyes,
Left it to us to say,
Whether the custom that we mean,
We still shall do away;
Though strong conviction crossed our mind,
The custom to regret ;
To abolition now resigned,
The Montem's sun has set.
And only say if they approve
The Montem which they prize;
When others falsely represent
The question open yet,
At such a time we always meant
The Montem's sun should set.
THE CONDE DE MONTEMOLIN.
His Morning-Postian Majesty, the CoNDE DE MonTEMoLIN, paid a visit last week to Covent
Garden Market, and invested two or three of the principal fruiterers with the Order of the Spanish
Chestnut. His Morning-Postian Majesty and suite then proceeded to the Bedford Hotel, where basins
of mock-turtle were served, and the royal stranger exhibited great curiosity to know what the
mockery consisted of . In the evening, his Morning Postian Majesty proceeded to the Grecian
Saloon, where he was pleased to exchange his refreshment ticket for a cigar; and having witnessed
as much of the Opera as could be got through until his cheroot was smoked out, he retired.

Cherry-Trees and Homicide.
In the debate for the abolition of the
killing of offenders by the hangman, MR.
BROTHERTON quoted the opinion of a
judge, who, in 1814, on passing sentence
on “the prisoner at the bar” for cutting
down a cherry-tree, said that “he who
would cut down a cherry-tree would kill
a man.” Verily, this judge must have
had a very confused notion of what passes
among men and among cherries as [black
hearts.

SMITHFIELD MARTYRS.–SMITHFIELD
“SALUBRITY.”
NDoubtedly the Court of Common Council
is blessed with long ears. Occasionally,
they lop heavily down like the ears of
a rabbit; and then they stand bolt-
upright, sharpened, pointed, at the cries
of distress, when uttered by golden
tongues. And the Smithfield Martyrs
have cried aloud to the Council ; and
the ears have risen to the call. Of
Smithfield Martyrs, however, there are
three kinds. And that the sensibility
of the reader may not mistakenly fall
upon the wrong lot, we proceed to de-
fine them.
There are, first, the Gridiron Mar-
tyrs of Smithfield—the respectable, but
unfortunate people, who were burnt out
of this bad world, as the surest mode of fitting them for a better.
Well, they are to be pitied somewhat ; but then it is a long time
ago, and it is the happiness of human nature to endure, with con-
siderable serenity, the miseries of others, especially when well got
over by death.
Then there are the Smithfield Martyrs of present hospitals. The
Martyrs knocked down, crushed, smashed, gored by the oxen on
their way to market, bound thither upon butchers' business, and
pricked thereto by the sticks of graziers. These Martyrs being—at
least many of them—Martyrs of our day, our sensibilities are, or
ought to be, quickened by contemporary suffering. Many of them
have been killed, and are therefore put decently out of sight. Earth
is apt to be an indulgent mother, and cover the greatest wrongs of
her children. Many, too, bear about them honourable scars, inflicted
in the street bull-fight: and many, until their dying day, limp in
memory of the vested interests of the Smithfield brute. These are
Martyrs for whom we may fulfil that duty to which grave-stones are
so often apt to invite us—and “drop a tear.”
And now come we to Smithfield Martyrs, class third ; for whom
as men, and particularly as Englishmen, we are bound to weep a very
deluge; we mean the Martyrs of the Breeches Pocket, the Money-
Martyrs, doomed, as they would declare, to drop their very best blood;
which is, of course, their very best cash.
DEPUTY Bedford made a most agonizing speech to the Council, on
behalf of Smithfield bullocks. It would have moved even ALDERMAN
GIBBs, had that cash Cato been a listener. The Deputy presented a
petition, signed by 2,000 of the graziers, butchers, salesmen, and
others interested in Smithfield Market, against the attempt to remove
it.
hear ! ”—or rather, returning to the long ears of the Common
Council, we should say, “Haw I have 1 " But the reader may wish to
know who, in addition to the graziers, butchers, and salesmen sign-
ing and crossing the petition, were the mysterious “others.” Why,
gentle reader, they were the drovers' dogs; it must be allowed, con-
siderably interested in the question that perilled the continuance of a
pleasant excitement—that of chasing the sheep under the horses'
bellies in the streets of London, to the loss of life and limb of London
wayfarers. (We understand, by the way, that an exclusive meeting
of the dogs, to get up a petition of their own, will next week take
place in Houndsditch).
DEPUTY Bedford, whose face, like the shield of Ajax, must be
covered with bull's hide, at least nine times thick, modestly, truthfully,
continued :-
“He believed it to be the opinion of all who were acquainted with the subject, that
Smithfield was the most eligible of all situations for a market, from its central position,
and the vast variety of its approaches and salubrity of cliMATE. (Hear, hear.)”
The softness of the climate has been known for centuries. It is a
matter of history, that Smithfield was once a vineyard, and grew the
finest Burgundy grapes. The vines, however, were somehow destroyed
when—in the good old times—our good old ancestors lighted fires
there. Nevertheless, the early lambs that are still produced at Smith-
field—why did DEPUTY BEDFord forget the interesting truth —suffi-
ciently attest the softness of the atmosphere. Indeed, in the most
English days, when the rest of London is dark with fogs, you have
only to drive to Smithfield, and—as though you had visited one of MR.
BURFoRD's Panoramas in Leicester Square—you will at once enjoy an

And the petition was received with a welcome “Hear !
Italian sky : blue—darkly, beautifully blew. The mildness of the
climate is made evident to the most careless observer; for even in
December, men may be seen in Smithfield in their shirt sleeves ; and
children, the careless little lazzaroni of Duke Street and Cock Lane
(two of the “vast variety” of the approaches), may be met with, shoe-
less and bare-headed, playing and crawling upon their knees, even like
their happy brethren of Portici. It is not generally known to a
superficial generation—too apt to leave digging for serious truths to
follow fun and bons-mots' butterflies—and, by the way, it sometimes
lies upon the conscience of Punch that he has, all undesignedly, put the
self-conceit of wit into most respectable dulness, as though every man,
woman, and child thought it a great social duty to think everything a
great joke, which it certainly is not—it is not, however, we say, to all
men that Long Lane and Cow Cross, two more of the variety of
approaches, are considered the city Montpelier and Madeira. Lodgings
in these balmy localities would carry an enormous price, did men not
run only after the gallimaufry of life, but think solemnly of the solemn
truths of existence. Such is the climate of Smithfield, that—we know
it for a fact, albeit the CHANCELLoR of THE ExchequER shall extort
no further intelligence from us ; and this—copper be praised —must
cost him three-pence—such is the Smithfield climate, that tobacco,
innocently bought for real Havannah, is grown not far from Islington,
and manufactured into fine, rich, brown cigars in Hosier Lane.
Now, does it not speak many volumes for the modest self-restraint
of DEPUTY Bedford, that, knowing these facts—for we would not
take the responsibility of doubting his acquaintance with every one of
them—that he should not have given them utterance 2 For surely
he might, when he spoke of the “salubrity” of Smithfield. However,
perhaps he only nurses them, to come out at a fitting season with the
agglomerated truth as a smasher.
DEPUTY Bedford rather touchingly alluded to the project of
moving the market ; saying, almost pathetically, that—
“It was quite unnecessary for him to attempt to add to the feeling which the citizens
of London entertained of so liberal and disinterested an interference with a place of
business, in which 7,000,000l. changed hands annually. (Hear, hear.)”
The most superficial spectator must have seen how every Common
Council waistcoat moved and undulated—the heart beneath suddenly
beating thick—at the £7,000,000 !
“A thousand hearts are throbbing in my breast !”
cries Richard, at Bosworth : now there were 7,000,000 in the capa-
cious bosom of every Common-Councilman, with every heart just one
pound weight.
And with good reason ; remove the market, and you of course
annihilate the whole £7,000,000, as the money could not change hands
elsewhere; whilst, as it is, every man who receives any part of the
£7,000,000, immediately lays it out in the shop of a citizen, and does
not carry it away with him. Therefore, drive bullocks through
crowded London—let passengers bleed in the streets, that butchers and
graziers may bleed from their pockets in the gin-shops of Smithfield
and Long Lane.
Of course the arguments advanced by DEPUTY BEDForm will fall
with merciless weight upon Her Majesty's Ministers, at this time pre-
paring a sanatory measure for the metropolis and the great towns of
England. Doctor Southwood SMITH, MR. Toy NBEE, LoRD AshLEY,
and other persons meddling with the vested rights —that is, the vested
muck—of society, have lifted up their venal voices against private
slaughter-houses in the thickest parts of London ; places that are,
as a matter of course, the luxuriant offshoots of salubrious Smithfield.
Doctor SMITH speaks of the effluvia—the mortal effluvia—arising
from the garbage and filth of butchery, and doing the work of death
in the lungs of the surrounding population.
This is, however, either design or pure ignorance on the part
of the Doctor. Before maturing the measure, Ministers will, of
course, examine DEPUTY BEDFord, who, with his customary emphasis,
will prove that as Smithfield, the great cattle market, is “salubrious”
to the City—so must the beasts removed therefrom bear with them
to every London lane and back-street the like health-giving sweetness:
in the same way that for those who cannot visit the healthful spring
itself, the benevolent chemist imparts the water in stone bottles.
We shall never again meet a citizen—Alderman or Common
Councilman—with a red and purple face, that we shall not, from the
ruddiness, set him down as a native of Smithfield. How men, in this
hastily-judging world, are wronged We are now assured of it :
again and again what has been set down to the effect of turtle, port,
and Burgundy, has been no other than Smithfield salubrity in great
| excess.

SPORTING AT CANNES.
Å GENTÉ ĀGOING OUTA SHOOTYNGF.
WE find, from the papers, that MR. John TEMPLE LEADER has
been following up the pleasures of the chase at Cannes, in the absence
of his learned friend, Lord BRough AM. By the bye, his lordship
declares that he never hunted a boar in all his life; and indeed we
believe him, for there would have been something suicidal—making a
small allowance in the way of spelling—for his persecution of that
Our advices from Cannes give us a very curious
picture of the sports of the field, as indulged in by the nominal M. P.
for Westminster. An artist who draws his pictures from the life, or
rather, draws all the life from his pictures, has sent us a very graphic
sketch of the pastimes now proceeding at Cannes, as far, at least, as it
is possible to see them from such a distance. -
According to the comparison we have been able to make between
the original and the copy, we think them alike , as near, at least, as
circumstances could have permitted. These circumstances, being
some hundreds of miles off, may account for some trifling discrepancy
between the thing intended to be delineated and the picture.
TEIE TENOR OF THE CURSE.
ThE celebrated FRAsch.INI, the Tenore della maledizione, has appeared
at Her Majesty's Theatre. His imprecation in Lucia di Lammermoor
certainly justified all that we had heard said of it. We fully expected
that our blood wonld run cold, and we went prepared with a thermo
meter, which, upon application to our pulse, indicated, during the
tremendous maledizione, thirty-five of Fahrenheit. The audience
would have kept FRAsch IN1 cursing all night, had it not been unrea-
sonable to demand more than a pair of maledictions in one evening.
Fortunately, our veins resumed their wonted fluency at the Fra Poco,
which warmed us up after our recent chill ; or we might have found
our circulation completely stopped, and that, we need scarcely say,
would have been the death of us. We looked in vain for the singing
from the eyes, with which a contemporary had given us to understand
FRAsc:IINI would favour us. He certainly acted with his eyes, and
lashed himself up into enthusiasm, while the audience applauded “like
winking.” FRAschi Ni has one of those voices, di petto, which are great
pets with us; instead of that voce di testa which is in some cases detestable.
Though we have made some cursory remarks on his curse, we do not
mean to say that malediction only is his forte, for he can also take his
place as a tenore di tenerezza among the very first of that quality.
THE PLOUGHMAN’S PETITION.
KIND gentlefolks, Members of Parliament, pleaseye,
I'm a poor agricultural labouring man;
I am sure I'm uncommonly sorry to tease ye,
But I hope you'll do something for me if you can.
Eight millions and more to the Irish you’ve granted ;
Very well, I have nothing to say against that :
I am told, and believe, that the money was wanted,
From starvation to save poor unfortunate Pat.
But you, who conduct the affairs of the nation,
So considerate to Paddy in want and distress,
Can't you help me a little in my situation ?
I don't think I deserve your benevolence less.
I work well for my living at least—what's my payment 7
Recollect that a wife and young children have I—
Seven shillings a week. Will it buy food and raiment 2
If it will, will it leave us a mite to lay by ?
You tell me, unless I can save from my wages
A provision enough to maintain me when old,
That the workhouse the only resource of my age is ;
How to save I should like very much to be told.
You say that the workhouse, by statesmen discerning,
To punish improvident people was meant :
If you'll show how a man with the pittance I’m earning
Can be provident, gentlemen, I'll be content.
Of my labour I'm told that dependent the pay is
On the law, as 'tis called, of supply and demand;
If that pay is too little, then all I can say is,
There is something amiss in the law of the land.
If you cannot insure us, by wise legislation,
For an honest day's labour an honest day's hire,
Don't you think now to render us fair compensation,
That both reason and justice your honours require 2
Put the means in our pow'r, and we'll readily hoard them,
To provide for our age, as you say we should do,
If your law of supply and demand won't afford them,
We've a right to expect the provision from you.
We do all that we possibly can for a living ;
There are some, I believe, I can mention that don't ;
Unto those that will work sure there's reason for giving,
If there's any for giving to people that won't.
To the truly deserving of succour extend it :
And if able to scrape up a few millions more,
On a sort of asylums suppose that you spend it—
For your old agricultural destitute poor.
FOREIGN TONGUES.
The Post correspondent states that not a word of Portuguese is
spoken at the Queen's Palace at Lisbon. The same thing is reported
of Buckingham Palace, where, it is said, if a person puts a question in
English, he is asked in German or French what he means; but we
shºuld like to know who believes the absurdity. The same story is
told against Louis-PHILIPPE, for it was suggested to him a few months
back, when the Entente Cordiale was a little more cordial than it is at
present, to put up a sign over the Tuileries, and call it “The British
Hotel.” And yet we know very well that His Majesty's attachment
to the English extended no further than a sincere desire “to take them
in.” After all, subjects care very little what languages their sovereigns
speak as long as they can depend upon their words.
A Vonder—A Popular Tax I
A GENTLEMAN, who signs himself “One of the Husbands of England,”
has sent in a proposal to Lord JoHN RUssell for raising a new tax,
which would have the novelty of being a great relief to the suffering
community, besides checking a growing evil. It is to apply the
Patent Mile Index to the tongues of women, and charge them so much
a mile. He calculates the loan of £8,000,000 would be paid off in less
than six months. We can see but one objection—and that is, the
enormous noise there will be, in consequence of the endless disputes of
the fare.
Nothing. When YOU ’RE USED TO IT.
GUIzot and NoaxiaNBy have made it up. When it is recollected
they only quarrelled about a lie, we think no one who understands the
least about diplomacy can blame them for not allowing such a trifle as
that to stand between them.

THERE has been a great row on Mount Olympus. MERCURY, who is
FPunch's guinea-a-liner, has forwarded the report; but with the sin of
prolixity common to the tribe. We have therefore cut MERCURY down
to the following paragraph :—
The new planet discovered by M. LEveRRIER has, it seems, been
christened NEPTUNE. The news no sooner reached Olympus, than a
row commenced. BAccHUs wanted to know why the planet was not
called after him He thought it very hard that he, who had lighted
so many men's noses, should be forgotten by the vinous illuminati.
JUPITER said he thought he might have had the planet : he knew he
had one already, but what of that ? When trumpery kings of earth
sported he could hardly tell how many stars, he thought that he
should have at least two. WULCAN, who swore dreadfully, said he had

a great mind to supply no more material to men for railways, when
they left him without a planet to put his head in. And when MARs
reminded him that his wife VENUs had a very beautiful planet,
MULCIBER looked savage, as though he could, an' he would, say a great
deal, but wouldn't.
When the express sunbeam left Olympus with the above, the com-
motion was not settled ; many of the gods swearing, for all the world,
like aetors, that they would positively not appear again, unless each
and all of them came out as the Star.
Old NEPTUNE is, we understand, very much conceited with the honour
paid him ; and was seen on Monday last, at Herne-Bay, swaggering
along the beach, pelting nursery-maids with pearls, and presenting
little sucklings with corals.

We should be glad if MR. HUME would move
for a return of all the Ethiopians at present in this country, whether
Lantum, Ohio, or otherwise; as, in the present paucity of provisions,
every unnecessary addition to the population is a serious evil.
So universal is the taste for these dingy melodists becoming, that we
should not be surprised to find the stars of the Italian Opera reduced
to the necessity of competing with the present attraction by adopting
the peculiarities of Ethiopian Serenaders; LABLACHE on the bones, and
MARIo on the banjo, would be an irresistible novelty. At all events it
would be worth while to try the experiment of a revival of Otello, in
which the Moor, assisted by his Lieutenant and his Ancient, might
introduce “Buffalo Gals, come out to night,” with the usual accompani-
ment furnished by the Ethiopians.

EXPLOSION OF THE GUN-COTTON.
How quickly the gun-cotton has gone out! People were so full of

ton was a very short one; it died a disappointed creature. It gave great
expectations at first, from the modest manner in which it went to

thus had the freedom of the city very
often presented to him in a snowball or

boast of even this amount of intimacy
between himself and the electors, for
his public life has been passed in the
provinces. If Beulah Spa were to be
allowed to send a member to Parlia-
ment, we know of no man so worthy as the Wandering Minstrel, of
the suffrages of that romantic tea-garden. We have no doubt that
if he were sent into the House of Commons, he would propose the
emancipation of the Gipsies, and recommend the appointment of a
committee to inquire into the propriety of having a British resident
at the Swiss Cottage, to encourage emigration to Norwood. The
electors of Westminster do not, however, require, as their represen-
tative, a gentleman who can touch a few notes on the guitar. They
want rather an able supporter of the popular cause, who, in matters
of practical improvement, can play first fiddle.
DELICIOUS.
A YouNG Irelander was saying that M. SoYER's soup was the
greatest luxury he had had for years. Upon being universally laughed
at for this declaration, he exclaimed, “It’s true, nevertheless; for I can
assure you it's so delicious, that the more I take of it the more it
brings the water into my mouth.”
has retired without fulfilling any of these brilliant promises. It is
supposed the ether has put it out, for it is very true, that since the
ether has been in persons' mouths, we have not had the gun-cotton so
much in our ears.
THE SPANISEI DANCE.
THIs dance lately has been a great deal in favour. The Duc DE
MoNTPENSIER was the first to introduce it. He executed the step in a
fine bold style, changing partners with the husband of IsabelLA,
giving his hand to the INFANTA, then executing a double shuffle, doing
the chaine anglaise, and going back again to the position he first occu-
pied in France, only taking his partner with him. This Spanish
dance was very popular in Paris; much more so than the one lately
attempted by Lola MonTEs at Munich. She has been enlivening the
dance with a number of new capers with the King, but the populace
don't admire the step much. It is expected the next movement will
be a general gallop towards the frontier, where, the Spanish danseuse
will be left to dance a pas seul by herself. There has been a tremen-
dous rise in the price of Bavarian beer, and the rising is quoted as
another instance of the unpopularity of the Spanish dancer. There
may be a few grains of truth in this, as we all know that beer is depend-
ent upon the state of the hops.

FIGHTS TO COME OFF.
LoRD BRough AM is ready to meet EARL DEvoN, or LoRD LoNDoN-
DERRY, or any lord in the House, to have two or three rounds with
them, on any subject on any night, for any sum. LoRD BRough AM
begs to tell LoRD CAMPBELL, that he is not afraid to come up to the
scratch at any time his lordship is in sufficient training to have a spar
with him.
LoRD BROUGHAM defies LoRD LONDoNDERY or any of the Irish Land-
lords to a good, fair, stand-up fight on their own grounds. He only
asks for fair play, and as for favour, he wants none, and will give none.
LoRD BRough AM challenges all England, Ireland, and Scotland to
spar with him. His lordship is not particular as to weight, size, or
condition, or age, and he does not mind what are the odds. His lord-
ship's money is lodged at BELLAMY's.
LORD BRough AM challenges the whole world upon the same terms.
POLICE BAL MASQUE.
AMONG the Réunions of the season that is just commencing, none will
create greater interest in certain circles—and squares—than an
intended Bal Masqué on a grand scale, which is about to be given by
the Police, for the purpose of accustoming themselves to those disguises
which they are now authorised to wear on numerous occasions. The
ball will be sanctioned by the Commissioners, as it is very desirable
that the deceptions the Police are permitted to practise should be
complete, and they can only obtain an easy bearing in their masque-
rade dresses by having occasional opportunities of wearing them. We
have heard that among some of the most piquant and original costumes
will be found those of a coiner, used for the purpose of facilitating
Mint prosecutions; and an entire smasher's suit, as worn by a police-
man, when encouraging the passing of bad money with a view to the
collection of evidence.

LORD PALMERSTON'S CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY.
At the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, last September, LoRD PALMERston addressed one of the
after-dinner conclaves on the wonders of nature as revealed by modern
science, and expressed his conviction, that the contemplation of the
vastness of the universe was admirably calculated, by its proving our
absolute insignificance, to render us indifferent to sublunary woes.
It is understood that his lordship's endeavours to reduce his theory
to practice, have met with the most marked success; that his instruc-
tions to the MARQUIs of NormanBy to come to an accord with
M. GUIzot were the consequence of his passing a night in the contem-
plation of Saturn's ring ; and that his subsequent verification of the
accuracy of MR. ADAMS's calculations of the distance of the new planet
Neptune from the sun, have rendered him utterly indifferent to the
mortification of the MonTPENSIER marriage.
Science has not made LoRD PALMERSTON indifferent to the happiness
of his fellow-creatures. If our informant does not mislead us, he has
suggested an application to LoRD RossE to place his telescope at the
disposal of government, in order that the starving Irish may be enabled,
by the visual assurance that nebulae are astral agglomerations, to
sustain, with perfect equanimity, the loss of the potato; and has
addressed to MR. LABouchERE an official minute of his lordship's firm
conviction, that the general employment of night telescopes in the
fever hospitals will be effectual as the vapour of ether in preventing
bodily anguish.
THE CARNIVAL OF LONDON.
GREAT preparations are being made for this Protestant Carnival,
that will commence two days before the fast of the 24th ; the Irish
Landlord Lent.
It is expected that the ring in Hyde Park will be very gay, the
dresses and masks of the most various and fanciful description.
Many of the Irish landlords will appear in characters taken from the
#|B. ggar's Opera.
The MARQUEss of LoNDoNDERRY as Cato, and LoRD BROUGHAM as
Clown, will engage with enormous sugar-plums.
MR. RoeBUCK will pelt the Irish landlords with eggs, filled, as usual,
with the strongest rose-water.
We have seen the mask and dress prepared for MR. H. GRATTAN.
He will represent to the life the nondescript thing set forth by CUMBER-
LAND–namely, A Talking Potato.
That the Fast may be kept with all proper rigidity, the dining-hour
throughout the fashionable world will, on Monday and Tuesday,
commence at four instead of nine: and on Tuesday, in particular,
dishes will continue to be brought in until the clock strikes midnight,
in order that the succeeding four-and-twenty hours may be passed
with proper abstinence.
EXPLANATION OF AFSOP'S FABLES FOR DULL STUDENTS.
I.—The Foa, who lost his Tail in the Gin.
THE Fox stood seized of an estate in trap, and by a device duly
executed he left his hairs a remainder in tail.
II.-The For and Crow.
In this case the Crow was evidently seized of a piece of cheese, with
contingent remainder to the Fox, in case she opened her mouth, which,
on her doing so, instantly descended to the Fox, who became seized of it.
Cambridgiana.
WHEN the deputation from Trinity College which waited upon
PRINCE ALBERT had announced his election, he begged to inquire
whether, as he objected to the College cap, he might be allowed to wear
his own hat 2 To this the deputation replied, that the question must
be referred to the Caput.
The Prince also informed them, that as he was in the habit of dining
with HER MAJESTY, he should feel more at home in having his
commons at Queen's. It was therefore decreed, that he should be
admitted as a Hat Fellow Commoner at Queen's.
A RIVAL TO THE MONTEM.
IN consequence of the feeling that has been expressed by some of
the aristocracy and other parties of high position, in favour of the
continuance of the Eton Montem, for the purpose of collecting “salt," it
is, we believe, in contemplation to establish a practise among the
police to collect a fund for the Inspector, under the name of “pepper.”
The members of the force will, it is understood, perambulate the prin-

* . . . . . [From our own Correspondent.]
MR. PUNCH,
As I am aware that, in the
balmy summer months, you
frequently visit this fresh-
water retreat to catch the
º, stray saline breezes from the
Great Nore, I feel much more
than satisfied to know that
you will be delighted at the
flourishing prospect of a
town in which Pleasure
dances with Commerce.
We are all alive ; and it
is in . consequence of the
extraordinary impetus given to business of every kind. Allow me to
jot down a few of our doings. -
All the butchers have purchased more than treble their week's stock,
and oxen and sheep—to say nothing of droves of pigs on their uncon-
scious way to the porkman's—fill every street. Children are screaming,
and women threatening to faint.
All the poulterers have geese, ducks, fowls, with festoons of pigeons,
hung from garret to shop-windows.
Shrimps are on the rise, and, it is expected, will be eighteenpence a
pint by the end of the week.
At every tavern and inn, brewers' men are delivering barrels of beer
and GUINNEss's stout.
Even in this weather ginger beer is going up.
Papers for the hire of extra maids and waiters are seen in the window
of every eating-house and cookshop.
The tea-people are making a great stir, and, the number of cows
being limited, the drain upon the pumps is incessant.
The bakers are working double time; ditto pastrycooks. It is pre-
dicted that penny buns will be threepence.
I have watched all these doings with considerable anxiety, and have
just met the oldest inhabitant, of whom I inquired the cause. “Why,
sir,” said that respectable individual, “the people of Gravesend are not
to be caught napping again. For you remember, on the last two
solemn occasions of royal funerals—when London was so full of woe
that it overflowed into the country to enjoy itself—Gravesend was
picked to the bone of its last mutton chop by the multitude; eaten to
its last crumb. Therefore, sir, as a like incursion of Londoners may
be expected here on Wednesday next, we are only making necessary
preparations for—the General Fast.”

and remained insensible for such a length of time, that their owners,

Excheques to employ M. SoYER to make John BULL, some palatable
hemlock soup, that he may be humanely skinned whilst insensible.
Whether BULL, like the asses, shall “recover in a short time” after the
flaying, we may not say ; as, however, he will soon have nothing to

LovE songs BY THE FAT contRIBUTOR.
THE DOMESTIC LOVE SONG.
RTICLEs of furniture are de-
servedly favourite subjects
with domestic poets; witness
those celebrated verses, “My
uncle's old hat,” “My grand-
mother's muff,” “My ances-
tor's coal-scuttle,” &c., by
Miss BUNIon and other poet-
esses, which have taken such
a strong hold on the affections
of the public. Our stout friend
evidently knew the value of
furniture when he composed
the following lyric. It is
crammed full of goods, like a
broker's shop, and has a
touching and domestic pathos,
which contrasts agreeably
with the May Fair swagger
of the poem we printed a
fortnight since.
The circumstances of the
poem are these :—The Con-
tributor, then lodging in Bid-
borough Street, Burton Cres-
cent, had received a present
of shrimps from a kind friend at Gravesend, and asked his landlady,
MRs. RUNT, and her daughter to breakfast, when the young lady not only
sate in the “cane-bottomed chair,” but broke it. The little affair of the
chair happened many years ago, and our friend has long quitted
MRs. RUNT's apartments : he says it was despair in love that tore him
thence, for he entertained a violent passion for Miss R., as usual ; but
her excellent mother persists that it was irregularity of rent-payments
which caused the serious difference with her lodger.
Nor could a young man in impoverished circumstances, as the C.
then was, expect much better treatment at the hands of Miss R.
That young lady was virtuously attached to the first-floor, LIEUTENANT
Bong of the Bombay Artillery, whom she married, and, as MRs.
CAPTAIN Bong, is the happy mother of a very large family.
As for her spirit revisiting the Contributor's arm-chair, that is all
bosh. People don't sit on it, but for the reason of breakage above
stated ; and poems of later dates, “To IANTHE ;” “To ZULEIRA ;”
“To AURELIA,” &c., show that the rogue was not more inconsolable
about other disappointments than about this one. Of course he
makes the most of his feelings; every poet does ; a true poet howls
if he is pricked with a pin, as much as an ordinary man who got
three dozen :—that is the beauty of poetic sensibility.
In tattered old slippers that toast at the bars,
And a ragged old jacket perfumed with cigars,
Away from the world and its toils and its cares,
I've a snug little kingdom up four pair of stairs.
To mount to this realm is a toil, to be sure,
But the fire there is bright and the air rather pure;
And the view I behold on a sunshiny day
Is grand through the chimney-pots over the way.
This snug little chamber is crammed in all nooks,
With worthless old knicknacks and silly old books,
And foolish old odds and foolish old ends,
Cracked bargains from brokers, cheap keepsakes from friends.
Qld armour, prints, pictures, pipes, china, (all cracked,)
Old rickety tables, and chairs broken-backed;
A twopenny treasury, wondrous to see :
What matter ? 'tis pleasant to you, friend, and me.
No better divan need the Sultan require,
Than the creaking old sofa that basks by the fire ;
And 'tis wonderful, surely, what music you get
From the rickety, ramshackle, wheezy spinet.
That praying-rug came from a Turcoman's camp;
By Tiber once twinkled that brazen old lamp ;
A Mameluke fierce yonder dagger has drawn :
'Tis a murderous knife to toast muffins upon.
Poor-Law Pill,
Long, long through the hours, and the night, and the chimes,
Here we talk of old books, and old friends, and old times ;
As we sit in a fog made of rich Latakie
This chamber is pleasant to you, friend, and me.
But of all the cheap treasures that garnish my nest,
There's one that I love and I cherish the best ;
For the finest of couches that's padded with hair
I never would change thee, my cane-bottomed chair.
'Tis a bandy-legged, high-shouldered, worm-eaten seat,
With a creaking old back, and twisted old feet ;
But since the fair morning when FANNY sate there,
I bless thee and love thee, old cane-bottomed chair.
If chairs have but feeling in holding such charms,
A thrill must have passed through your withered old arms 1
I looked, and I longed, and I wished in despair;
I wished myself turned to a cane-bottomed chair.
It was but a moment she sate in this place,
She’d a scarf on her neck, and a smile on her face 1
A smile on her face, and a rose in her hair,
And she sate there, and bloomed in my cane-bottomed chair.
And so I have valued my chair ever since,
Like the shrine of a saint, or the throne of a prince ;
Saint FANNY, my patroness sweet I declare,
The queen of my heart and my cane-bottomed chair,
When the candles burn low, and the company's gone,
In the silence of night as I sit here alone—
I sit here alone, but we yet are a pair—
My FANNY I see in my cane-bottomed chair.
She comes from the past and revisits my room;
She looks as she then did, all beauty and bloom ;
So smiling and tender, so fresh and so fair,
And yonder she sits in my cane-bottomed chair.
PHYSIC FOR IRELAND.
THE case of Ireland reminds us of one which frequently occurs in
medical practice. A patient is labouring under a state of constitution
which can only be remedied by perseverance with some unpalatable
remedy—say, a very bitter pill. The sufferer does not like the treat-
ment necessary for him ; accordingly he resorts to vegetable medicines
—elixirs of life—and runs the whole round of the specifics of advertising
uacks.
q At last, an attack of illness, threatening instant dissolution, throws
him on his bed. A regular practitioner is then sent for, and prescribes
the physic that should have been administered in the first instance,
shaking his head, observing that he should have been applied to before,
and hoping that his assistance may not have been sought too late.
Thus has LoRD John Russell, at the eleventh hour, been called in by
the friends of Ireland, and with these misgivings he prescribes the

EXPIRING ACTS OF PARLIA-
MENT.
WE read in the Morning Post a few
days ago a most affecting paragraph
under the touching title of “Expiring

an onion ready—to mourn over the
deplorable condition of these expiring

the coarser for daily use—of our nature.
To lead of a list of Expiring Acts
with one that is to live till the National
Debt is paid off—an immortality, at
the least—is a delusion, a snare, and
a mockery.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LORD BROUGHAM AND THE LAW OF MARRIAGE.
AE? Is Lordship has discovered an
7 awful and alarming flaw in the
existing law regarding marriage;
for though it is wisely and ex-
pressly provided by the canons
that a man may not marry his
grandmother, there is no security
against a man's marrying his
great-grandmother,if his connubial
wishes should take that very an-
tique direction. Lord Bhough AM
purposes to step in, and at once,
by a new enactment, render this
sort of marriage impossible. We
long for the day upon which
Lord BRough AM will ask leave
to bring in his bill, for the
debates on its several stages will
give a liveliness to the hitherto
exceedingly dull proceedings in
Parliament. We are always
happy to assist the legislative
labours of a man like Load
BRough AM, and we therefore have
much pleasure in presenting for
his approval the draft of a mea-
sure for securing the boon which
his senatorial heart is bent upon.
We trust he will do us the justice to place our proposed bill before the
excellent Society for the Amendment of the Law, at the very earliest
opportunity.
PREAMBLE.
&Ibrreag it is expedient that a check should be placed on inter-
marriage between great-grandsons and their great-grandmothers, and
to extend to the aforesaid great-grandmothers and great-grandsons
the law which is now in force with reference to grandsons and grand-
mothers only:
Ønt UNI) creag it is desirable to bring great-grandmothers under
the restraining clauses of a certain Act, passed in a previous reign, and
to give great-grandsons the benefit of that wholesome section of the
said Act, which prevents a grandson from leading his grandmother to
the hymeneal altar:
Be it therefore Enacted, by and with the consent of HER MAJEsty
and the Houses of Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, that
a marriage between a great-grandson and a great-grandmother shall
be ipso facto void ; and that there shall be a penalty of £ on any
clergyman who shall knowingly attempt to solemnise a farce of such
broad absurdity.
The above Act may be extended by some penal clauses, inflicting
penalties for incipient flirtations between great-grandsons and great-
grandmothers, which might terminate in the evil that the law is in-
tended to provide against.
We trust that this outline will satisfy the scrupulous mind of Lord
BROUGHAM. -
ECONOMICAL GROG.
ON THE PLAN of Moxsie UR soy ER's EcoxoMICAL soups.
TAKE a pint of boiling water, and put into it a thin slice of
lemon. Add to this a few grains of nutmeg, and three lumps of white
sugar. Pour out into wine-glasses, stir up with silver spoon, and
drink warm. The cost is as follows:—

The above quantity will suffice for at least a dozen people. The
flavour is something quite novel, and, besides having the recommenda-
tion of excessive cheapness, is found to be very refreshing, and, provid-
ing it is taken in moderation, exceedingly healthy. It is just the thing
to take before singing a convivial song, or after proposing a friend's
health. A person may take six tumblers of it with the greatest com-
fort, without feeling any of those boisterous effects or nervous headaches
the following morning, which result from drinking grog made of gin,
*::::: rum, or brandy. It is strongly recommended for the use of
annllies.
SMITHFIELD AND ST. BARTHOLOMEW’S.
WE are surprised that a particular class of individuals, whose
“vested interests" will be peculiarly injured in the event of Smithfield
market being done away with, have not come forward to protest against
its abolition. . We allude to the students at the neighbouring Hospital
of St. Bartholomew, who pay a considerable—not to say exorbitant—
sum for the permission to attend the surgical practice there ; and
especially to the dressers, who give fees still larger for the privilege of
assisting in the treatment of accidents. The suppression of a fruitful
source of “interesting cases” will prove most injurious to these young
men, by depriving them of countless valuable opportunities of bone-
setting and bandaging, for which they have laid out little fortunes.
Let their Governors—paternal as well as Hospital—look to this. All
we can say is, that if Smithfield Market is removed, the Bartholomew
surgeons must, in fairness, make a great reduction in their terms.
There must be a tremendous fallin Hospital Practice, and an alarming
sacrifice in Dresserships.
THE
GALLERY C F THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
Notwithstanding that it is the place appointed for the congregation
of so many of the lights of the age, the darkness of the House of Com-
mons is becoming a grievance that it is exceedingly difficult to tolerate.
The Reporters' Gallery is now utterly obscure; in consequence,
probably, of the ascending vapour from the speeches of the various
members, who certainly have the knack of being able to mystify even
the very clearest atmosphere. There is no doubt that, in legislation, it
is decidedly necessary to feel your way, but it is as well to be able to
see your way also.
The unhappy Reporters, who are not allowed the benefit of candles to
make their darkness somewhat visible, are compelled to take notes by
the merest guess-work,
and to eliminate from the
chaos of scrawls and
scratches the debates
which deck the next day's
newspapers. The dark-
ness of the spot has, in
|
|
º
|
pitch of pitchiness, that
avoid
which might be fraught
with considerable danger;
for though many of them are tolerably hard-headed, they are scarcely
capable of sustaining such shocks as a meeting—skull to skull—might
expose them to.
Some of the members who
sit under the gallery are in
the same dilemma with refer-
ence to the darkness, and
even the economical MR. Jo-
sEPH HUME, whose soul is in
the save all, has been known
to ask for a rushlight—or ||
even to plunge into a dip— ||
to enable him to read some
important document.
We really think that the
Reporters should be allowed
the privilege of the Cornish
miners, and be permitted to
walk into the dark gallery
assigned to them with lights
fastened on to their heads,
for the purpose of illuminating
the gloom in which their busi-
ness is transacted. . -

To MR. PUNCH.
SIR,-MY attention having been called to an assertion by SIR H.
BARRON, that “a cry has been raised against the Irish landlords by
the moneyed men of the City of London, in order to depreciate Irish
estates in the market, and then buy them at reduced values,” I am
induced to address you on this very painful subject. |
Sir, I am a “moneyed man.” I have bought an Irish estate,
whether at a lower price than its real value, you will judge by the
subjoined journal of what I do not hesitate to call the most agonising
month of my existence, though I have gone through all corporate
offices (except that of Lord Mayor) and have had disputes with the
Common Council.
When I purchased this estate a month ago (980 acres at an average
of £20 per acre,) I was a hale portly man of 17 stone, with the usual
outward characteristics of my age (52), position (Alderman of the
City of London), and calling (drysalier). I now weigh 13 stone! I
am pale, nervous, and emaciated. Why I am thus changed, the
subjoined will inform you. Hoping that my melancholy tale may
deter others in my position,
I remain, Sir,
Your constant reader,
John CALLIPAsh.

The kitchen is the only room inhabitable; and I cannot say that the
bailiff exhibited that willingness to make room for my luggage which
I have a right to expect.

wishing to know if I’d brought my coffin with me?—I am not to be
intimidated.
14th. Assembled tenants, and informed them that I had bought the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW BAVARIAN MINISTRY.
THE events that have recently happened in Bavaria, through the instrumentality of the Spanish
dancer, LoLA MonTEs, are certainly full of dramatic interest. The revolution effected by a member
of the coregraphic art, is something quite new in our modern annals ; and the idea of a danseuse
being instrumental to the overthrow of the Jesuits, has suggested to several members of the corps
de ballet in France and England to send in tenders to the various Cabinets of Europe for effecting
any great political changes that may be required.
The influence of Terpsichore has already been felt on the government of more than one European
nation ; and FANNY ELLsleR's interview with the Pope, soon after his elevation to the papal chair,
may probably have had a considerable share in bringing about the reforms which have so astonished
the world, as proceeding from a quarter hitherto considered to be most bigoted and inflexible.
The part recently acted by LoLA MonTEs might well serve as the foundation of a grand political
ballet, (of which we furnish a brief outline), to be called
s---
FA
º
LE ROI ET LA DANSEUSE. .
The King or Bavaria, worn out with the cares of government, and worried to death by his
jesuitical ministry, sends for the fair Lola, who has just arrived, to make her appearance at the
Imperial Theatre of Bavaria. At first he is indifferent to her pas and poses; but she soon attracts
his notice by pointing her toe with tremendous expression towards some disaffected members of the
ministry. The King's attention becomes arrested, and he would fain ask for an explanation, when
the graceful Lola goes off into a boundless group of endless entrechats. The sovereign seems puzzled,
and is about to pursue the delightful creature, for the purpose of putting further questions to her,
when she gaily gallops off and disappears among the mass, into which the royal pursuer refuses to
follow his lovely fugitive.
In the next tableau the King is represented torn by conflicting passions and thinking of LoLA.
Five of his Ministers come in and dance a pas de cinq, which goes by the name of the Pas des
Jésuites. The King seems distracted at the labyrinth into which he is drawn by the intricate move-
ments of this complicated pas; but he continually turns round, as if looking for the lovely Loſ A.
The Bishop of Augsburgh then presents himself with a downcast look, and two beautiful fountains
suddenly start from his eyes, which continue to run incessantly.
The King is about to yield on seeing the distress of the good Prelate, when the fascinating LoLA
comes bounding in, and pointing to the streaming eyes of the Bishop, indicates by her gestures
that he is a pump of the utmost duplicity. The King still seems dejected, when LoLA, by dancing
the Cachuca, gradually restores him to gaiety, when he joins her in a Polka, to the dismay of all his
courtiers. Upon this, the Ministers commence a grand pas de résignation, when the King fearing
he shall be left alone, appeals earnestly to Lola. She immediately summons some of her own
companions, who undertake to fill the vacant places, and dance the Pas de Cabinet, though with
some trifling awkwardness. She introduces, one by one, the three principal figures, each of whom
performs some “variations” of his own ; and the Minister of Education executes the College Hornpipe,
The New Ministria or The Ixterior.

to show his sympathy with the University.
The Minister of Finance then makes an
advance, and points to a Bank, which he
strikes, and a golden stream issues from
its side, with which he offers liquidation to
any extent, while he intimates by his action
that the golden stream acting on anything
produces a state of liquidation or solvency.
The Minister of the Interior is the next
that appears, and he takes an attitude of
firmness, which LoLA points out as a
proof of his value to the King of Bavaria.
After a variety of ins and outs, the fair
LoLA induces the King to allow the
formation of a Ministre Dansawite ; and a
picture is formed, of which the captivat-
ing Montes forms the centre, supported
by the KING of BAvARIA, who hangs ten-
derly over her, upon which pleasing picture

THE PARCEL POST.

What means that angry crowd 7
Why are those people quarrelling 2
Why are they talking loud 7
They're clamouring for the parcels |
They recently have lost,
Through foolishly confiding them
Unto the Parcel Post.
Behold the poor Inspector,
Left lonely in his shame,
To give three thousand parcels back,
And answer every claim ;
With bother render'd desperate,
He seeks the great LoRD MAYok,
And throws before the civic throne
The parcels in his care.
“My Lord, what shall I do with them?”
“Deliver them, of course,”
Replies his Lordship ; but 'tis vain,_
There is no cart, no horse. |
Thus the Inspector calmly spoke —
“My Lord, if through the streets
I send one of our vehicles,

“Who clutches by the bridle

And, for a debt, the equipage |

A single batch of parcels
I do not dare send out,
For creditors are dodging them
All London round about.
“And e'en our very servants,
For their arrears of pay,
Will from the parcels help themselves.
They do it every day.” -
His Lordship much regretted it,
But wisely shook his head;
Advice was quite impossible :
There's nothing to be said.
The poor Inspector then withdrew,
Expressing loud his fears
The whole establishment would soon
Be pull'd about his ears.
MORAL.
Before you start a Company,
'Tis better to take care
You've got sufficient capital
A loss at first to bear.
And as to speculation,
'Tis better let alone,
When all the cash you've got to lose
Is none of it your own.
And you Inspectors, guide yourselves
By this most sound reſlection :-
Don't be Inspectors of concerns
That will not bear inspection.

RI
VARI.
TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS.
ECENTLY, JUDY and
myself have expe-
rienced much anxi-
ety on account of our
youngest boy, AL-
BERT ERNEST, the
Prince's god-son,
who has lately com-
pleted his studies
with some distinc-
tion at Eton. He
was sent up for
cricket 77 times; he
also carried off the
third single-stick
prize, and was diving
medallist at the time
he left, all which may
be seen recorded to
our great pride in last
- year's Eton Alma-
w nack.
MAJoR-GENERAL SIR FREDERICR TRENCH is a worthy man. I have
had the good fortune to endear myself to him by the active part which
my paper has taken in the Great Horse Cause, now before the Court of
Public Opinion; and at this dull time of year we dine together, almost
daily, at the Carlton. I took occasion to consult him, a few days
since, as to what course I should adopt with regard to my unlucky
fºke to him with entire frankness. I told him that ALBERT
ERNest was good-tempered, well-grown, and very high-bred in his
manners, but vain, idle, illiterate, and devoid of all useful knowledge
to an incredible degree, considering the no-expense which had been
spared on his education; for before he went to Eton he was prepared for
a couple of years at the Rev. DR. Cotton's “Academia de' Nobili,” at
Kemptown, where a French man cook is kept, and where all the pupils
except himself and young DiBs, the banker, were noblemen's sons.
SIR FREDERIck mused for a short time.
“Your boy can't go into the navy,” said he, “he is too old for that,”
' ARTILLERY MESS
Besides, it is necessary for a lad to know a little before he is made a
middy, and a good deal before he is passed for a lieutenant. No banker -
or merchant would have anything to say to him if he is idle and
inexpert at accounts ; even at our public offices, now-a-days, they
give the preference to candidates who can speak and write a foreign
º, or two. How tall is he "I told him in a desponding tone
—“Six feet !”
The excellent man exclaimed briskly, “Cheer up, my dear friend.
From all you have told me concerning your son, it is clear that he is
eminently qualified for our cavalry. Write instantly to PRINCE
ALBERT ; I have often heard him speak of you with regard and
affection. He will, I am sure, be glad of the opportunity of serving
his favourite god-child.”
I reminded SIR FREDERICK that ALBERT ERNEst is decidedly not
clever ; and that where there were so many candidates for so few
vacancies, some preference must of course be shown to the most pro-
mising and best educated youths.
“None, whatever, my dear fellow,” said he.
Chief is strictly impartial on that score. You civilians are incapable of

commanding regiments, dislike lads who have had what is called a mili-
tary education, it only makes them priggish and conceited ; we prefer
young men from Eton and Oxford, who know nothing. We have then
no trouble in unteaching them. This may astonish you; but I think
that when you reflect on Waterloo and Jellalabad, and Aliwal and
Sobraon, you will admit that the system works well. I entered the
army myself, a mere child, eighty-four years ago; I knew nothing, and
was asked no questions at the time, have never opened a book or
answered a question since, and I am at this moment what you see
me, a Major-General ; and I flatter myself, not an undistinguished one.
All you have to do, is to get your son's name down on the Commander-
in-Chief's list ; lodge the money for his commission, and subsequent
steps, make him a liberal allowance, pay his debts from time to time,
and if he only attends tolerably to his drill, he will rise in his profession
as rapidly and surely as if he had written CAEsAR's Commentaries.”
I need scarcely say that I eagerly adopted the gallant officer's sug-
gestion, found PRINCE ALBERT all kindness, and the Duke, as SIR F.,
had assured me, all impartiality, and am expecting daily to see my
boy's name in the Gazette. I consider the information the worthy
baronet gave me, so curious and so interesting to every father of a
family whose sons are not, mentally, all a parent could wish, that I
have thought it my duty to lay it before the nublic.

MORE WESTED RIGHTS.
The Humble Petition of LEWIS NATHAN against the Abolition of the
Eton Montem.
SHEweTH,
THAT the Eton Montem is one of the most imposing spectacles
exhibited out of a theatre.
THAT it gives universal delight to those who perſonm in it, and is a
scource of great gratification to the fond mothers who take a natural
pride in seeing their sons in the beautiful clothes they wear on tha
ennobling occasion.
THAT those beautiful clothes are supplied by your Petitioner, who
has a constant supply of Greeks, Ojibbeways, and Charles the Seconds
always on hand, and keeps a good collection of Brigands, in the hope
of letting them out on the day of the Eton Montem.
THAT the Eton Montem, for that reason, is a matter of great emolu-
t
ment to your Petitioner, who always looks forward with a degree of
certainty to that great solemnity, together with the masquerades, to
enable him to pay his rent.
THAT the young noblemen who exhibit on that solemnity are his
best customers, and never think of asking the price of a Napoleon,
or a Robespierre, or a Jack Sheppard, as it is their respected fathers
who are expected to pay for the hire of those noble characters.
THAT if the Eton Montem be abolished, your Petitioner will be
deprived of the greater part of his income, and that all the above
splendid dresses will be thrown upon your Petitioner's hands; for as there
is nothing like the Eton Montem in the world, there will be no other
use or chance of display for them.
THAT, furthermore, the Eton Montem is one of the oldest institu-
tions of England, and must necessarily teach our young noblemen how
to carry themselves in after-life when they are appointed our ambas-
sadors, and senators, and field-marshals, and all those handsome
appointments which none but young noblemen are qnalified to fill.
It is therefore most earnestly prayed that the Eton Montem will not
be swept from the face of England, but will long be left to adorn it as
one of its grandest institutions ; or, in the event of its being rudely
abolished, that such ample compensation will be made to your
Petitioner as shall indemnify him from loss, due respect being paid to
the vested right your Petitioner and his descendants have in the
time-honoured and most respectable custom.
And your Petitioner will ever pray, &c.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE threatened abolition of inter-mural interments by Government
has caused, "we understand, the greatest excitement amongst the
undertakers, and others interested in their maintenance. In particular
it has occasioned the most extreme agitation on the part of that
numerous and respectable body, the proprietors of patent medicines,
who view the proposed measure with the deepest alarm, as obviously
calculated to inflict, the gravest, injury on their vested interests in consumption of patent medicines; but of course the above objections

It is intended, as we are informed, by this estimable class of men, to

THE WELLINGTON STATUE.
A cuRIous case under the Paving Act seems likely to arise in refer-
ence to this Statue, and the opinion of MR. BRIEFLEss has been taken
in order that the parties may act upon the very best legal advice that
is anywhere attainable. The Learned Gentleman being exceedingly
anxious to give his very best attention to this case, had previously
primed himself with a good draft of PETERspoRF, after which he took a
tolerably large slice of SElwyn, and he concluded by washing down the
whole with a quart of Show ER's Reports. Having strengthened himself
for his task by this tremendous feast of legal lore, our Learned
Friend took off his coat and waistcoat, for the purpose of having a
good stand-up tussel with the difficulties that were likely to present
themselves.
His opinion was required, Whether the Government or the Sub-
Committee of the Statue would be liable, under the Paving Act, for
obstructing the thoroughfare, supposing the Statue to be taken down
from the Arch and left for any one to tumble over at Hyde
Park Corner. Mr. BRIEFLEss has written the following lucid and
learned
OPINION.
“I am inclined to believe that this Statue does not fall within the
statute, for though the latter is exceedingly comprehensive, it is not
one of those statutes at large, through which it has been remarked
that a coach and six horses might be driven. There is an old case in
the books, which seems to say something pertinent to the present
question, but the pertinency is so merely apparent, that I do not think
it worth while to refer any further to that case, which I have thus
hinted at. I am of opinion that if the Statue is found to be an
obstruction, any policeman may order it to move on ; and if this order
is not attended to, it will become the duty of the policeman on duty
to remove the Statue on his own responsibility.
If he neglects to keep his beat perfectly clear, then he will become
liable to an action for his inaction, according to the well-known rule in
PUFFENDoRF. I have had some doubt whether the horse itself could
be taken damage feasant, but I am inclined to believe otherwise. A
horse is not a beast ferae natura, though the horse in question is a beast
ferrea naturae, but here the spelling makes all the difference. I do not
know whether the DUKE of WELLINGToN can be held responsible for
the acts of his representative, but I am strongly of opinion that the
qui facit per alium facit perse will not hold good in this instance.”

MISCHIEvous To THE LAST.
WESTMINstER Bridge has just sunk a barge in the most malicious
manner. We are surprised and hurt at finding a poor old creature
just on the brink of the grave, with its death-doom hanging over it,
rendering itself, to the very last, destructive of the property of others.
It appears that this pugnacious old pile struck a poor, decrepid, and
defenceless barge with one of its piers, and the imbecile craft had
scarcely recovered the shock when it received another terrific crack on
its larboard ribs from another malicious pier of the old Bridge at
Westminster. The unhappy barge went down immediately, but
fortunately no one suffered by the calamity, for the crazy creature was
deserted by all friends at the moment the first shock was perceptible.
Such a dig in the ribs has not been witnessed for some time as that
which the poor barge was made to endure from the violence of the hit
made by the Bridge in the merest wantonness.
It is true that the Bridge put on one of its arch looks, as much as to
say, “Now, stupid, where are you showing to ?” but there seems to us
no excuse for such a shameful act of cruelty as the hurrying into a
muddy grave a barge which was capable of doing no harm to any one.

MISS BIANCA GRIFFIN"—having

for her present most extensive
sion peculiarly auspicious for
the further development of
what she ventures to call the
tion for Young Ladies.
Were it necessary, Miss
GRIFFIN would not, for a mo-
ment, hesitate to specify the
number of years that has
elapsed since she was first
struck by the conviction that
the education of females began
and ended in an entirely erro-
neous principle. When Miss
GRIFFIN looks—as she con-
tinually does—round about the
world, she feels that Woman, to be thought more of, should think more of herself. For what,
it may be demanded, what do we not owe to her ? Without her, where—it may confidently

as the extras of life which married men care
nothing about. Now breakfasts, dinners, and

Man, as a lover—hideous hypocrite l—pro-
fesses to admire the theory of knowledge in
all its matters of filagree. As a husband he
demands the sternness of practice. He, who
with his affianced will talk of mounting to the

descend to the affairs of the kitchen. Man is
a monster; but we must make the best of him.

PUNCH*S PRIZE NOWELISTS.
PUNch’s PRIzE Novelists—so called because a Twenty THous AND
GUINEA PRIze is to be awarded to the successful candidate—will
embrace works by some of the most celebrated authors this country
boasts of.
Their tales will appear in succession, and pretty continuously, in the
pages of this Miscellany.
The publication will probably occupy about five-and-thirty years,
or more or less, according to the reception with which the novels meet
from our enlightened patrons—the generous British people.
All novels cannot be given entire, as a century would scarcely suf-
fice, so numerous are our authors, so prolific and so eager has been the
rush with stories, when our (confidential) announcement was sent into
the literary world. But fair specimens of the authors' talents will be
laid before the public, illustrated in our usual style of gorgeous
splendour.
The first prize will be 20,000 guineas, viz., a lottery ticket to that
amount, entitling the holder to the above sum or a palace at Vienna.
The second prize will be the volume of Punch for the current half-
year. The third a subscription to the British and Foreign Institute,
&c., &c.
With a pride and gratification we cannot conceal, we at once intro-
duce the public to GeoRGE DE BARNwell, by SIR E. L. B. L. B.B. L. L.
BB B. L. L. L., BART.
We are not at liberty to reveal the gifted author's name, but the
admirers of his works will no doubt recognize, in the splendid length
of the words, the frequent employment of the Beautiful and the Ideal,
the brilliant display of capitals, the profuse and profound classical learn-
ing, and, above all, in the announcement that this is to be the last of
his works—one who has delighted us for many years.

In Oort. DAY INT CIHEPE,
'Twas noonday in Chepe. High Tide in the mighty River City —
its banks well nigh overflowing with the myriad-waved Stream of
Man The toppling wains, bearing the produce of a thousand marts;
the gilded equipage of the Millionary ; the humbler, but yet larger,
vehicle from the green metropolitan suburbs (the Hanging Gardens of
our Babylon), in which every traveller might, for a modest remune-
ration, take a republican seat ; the mercenary caroche, with its private
freight ; the brisk curricle of the letter-carrier, robed in royal scarlet;
these and a thousand others were labouring and pressing onward, and
locked and bound and hustling together in the narrow channel of
Chepe. The imprecations of the charioteers were terrible. From the
noble's broidered hammer-cloth, or the driving-seat of the common
coach, each driver assailed the other with floods of ribald satire. The
pavid matron within the one vehicle (speeding to the Bank for her
semestrial pittance) shrieked and trembled ; the angry Dives
hastening to his offices (to add another thousand to his heap), thrust
his head over the blazoned panels, and displayed an eloquence
of objurgation which his very Menials could not equal ; the dauntless
street urchins, as they gaily threaded the Labyrinth of Life, enjoyed the
perplexities and quarrels of the scene, and exacerbated the already
furious cºmbatants by their poignant infantile satire. And the Phi-
losopher, as he regarded the hot strife and struggle of these Candidates
in the race for Gold, thought with a sigh of the Truthful and the
Beautiful, and walked on, melancholy and serene.
'Twas noon in Chepe. The ware-rooms were thronged. The
faunting windows of the mercers attracted many a purchaser : the
glittering panes, behind which Birmingham had glazed its simulated
silver, induced rustics to pause: although only noon, the savory odours
of the Cook Shops tempted the ever hungry citizen to the bun of Bath,
or to the fragrant potage that mocks the turtle's flavour—the turtle !
0 dapibus supremi grata testudo Joris / I am an Alderman when I think
of thee! Well: it was noon in Chepe.
But were all battling for gain there ? Among the many brilliant
shops whose casements shone upon Chepe, there stood one a century
back (about which period our tale opens) devoted to the sale of
Colonial produce. A rudely carved image of a negro with a fantastic
plume and apron of variegated feathers, decorated the lintel. The
East and the West had sent their contributions to replenish the
window.

The shop in questiºn was, in a word, a Grocer's.
In the midst of the shop and its gorgeous contents sate one who, to
judge from his appearance (though 'twas a difficult task, as, in sooth,
his back was turned), had just reached that happy period of life when
the Boy is expanding into the Man. O Youth, Youth ! Happy and
Beautiful O fresh and roseate dawn of life ; when the dew yet lies
on the flowers, ere they have been scorched and withered by Passion's
fiery Sun Immersed in thought or study, and indifferent to the din
around him, sate the Boy. A careless guardian was he of the treasures
confided to him. The crowd passed in Chepe ; he never marked it.
The sun shone on Chepe ; he only asked that it should illumine the
page he read. The knave might filch his treasures, he was heedless
of the knave. The customer might enter; but his book was all in all
to him.
And indeed a customer was there ; a little hand was tapping on the
counter with a pretty impatience ; a pair of arch eyes were gazing at
the Boy, admiring, perhaps, his manly proportions through the homely
and tightened garments he wore.

“You’re precious young to have all these good things,” the girl
exclaimed, not unwilling, seemingly, to prolong the conversation. “If
I was you, and stood behind the counter, I should be eating figs the
whole day long.”
“Time was,” answered the lad, and not long since I thought so,
too, “I thought I never should be tired of figs. But my old uncle
bade me take my fill, and now in sooth I am aweary of them.”
“I think you gentlemen are always so,” the coquette said.
“Nay, say not so, fair stranger ſ” the youth replied, his face
kindling as he spoke, and his eagle eyes flashing fire. “Figs pall;

ETHIOPIAN FASHIONS.
THE Ethiopian mania has had a wonderful effect upon the blacking
market, and WARREN's jet has gone up half a sixteenth in the market;
while DAY left off in the afternoon several shades better than it had
been in the morning. There is every reason to expect, that, in the
course of the ensuing season, we shall have “a grand Ethiopian ballet."
in which TAGLIoni will appear as Lucy Neal, while the renowned
VENAFRA, the O. SMITH of the Opera, will be called upon to “get out
of the way,” as the representative of “Old Dan Tucker.”
We have on previous occasions called attention to the Ethiopian
mania, but have not yet succeeded in checking it. Ethiopians are to
be found in every quarter of the town and every corner of the kingdom;
for a pennyworth of bones and a banjo, a ha'porth of soot, and an ounce
of suet, will set up a party of four, without further outlay.
Some of these Ethiopians, after sur-
reptitiously holding themselves out as
blacks, and colouring their fingers and
their faces, cannot be expected to come
out with clean hands, though when they
practise the imposition of calling them-
selves the Original Ethiopians, they are
little better, notwithstanding all their
manual nigritude, than light-fingered
gentry. It must be admitted that the
public has not dealt out its patronage
with a niggard hand to these niggered
melodists. We shall not be surprised if
the rage for Ethiopian blackness extends
to the occupants of the boxes as well as
to the performers on the stage, and we
shall expect to see Ethiopian head-
dresses, and Ethiopian masks for the

as the

THE LONG THURSDAYS AT THE OPERA.
--- HE liberality of the entertain-
a Bºžº of the Öp *a**! T ments at Her Majesty's Theatre
- º has rendered it necessary to elongate
the bills in a manner corresponding
with the extent of the attractions. If
we buy a bill in one street, we shall
find half of it round the corner of the
other, and it will soon be necessary to
fit up the boxes with rollers, for the
purpose of giving panoramic pro-
grammes of the performances.
Apropos of the Opera, we hear that
the renters contemplate an incursion
into all parts of Covent Garden, upon
its opening for Italian performances.
º: A renter's share, conferring a right to
º enter any part of the theatre, will, it is said, enable the
# = -- I purchaser of one of these articles—until lately so fearfully
H - - at a discount—to take his choice of any vacant seat before
~ the curtain in the whole establishment.
C- The possession of a renter's share will place upon a level
– the bishop and the shop-boy, the wearer of lawn and the
ALMA measurer of linen...The Duke ºr WELLINGToN may be
ousted from his position by any of the heroes of Waterloo-
House, and the clerical dignitary-the prebend, for
example—may be disturbed in his stall by his own parish
beadle. PUMMELL, and others of the virtuosi, who purchased
º: a free admission in the days of Covent Garden's decline,

to its presentrate of speed, will probably reach completion
by the time our great-grandchildren have great-grand-
children of their own. The appointments must be here-
--
-- ditary, we should say, the work proceeds, so very slowly.
--- At present only the letter A is completed. The present

about the most prolific in the alphabet, it will, when it is
reached, some time next century, absorb the entire life of
a literary man, let him live to twice the age of old PARR.
We have frequently heard of “men of letters...but this
catalogue-spinning will create a new class of littérateurs,
“the man of a single letter,” or, perhaps, “half a letter,
for the son, probably, may have to complete what the
father began in robust health, but perished in the middle

When the last letter has been given out, the SIR HENRY Ellis of that
unknown period, may with justice exclaim to the zealous student, who
is contemplating the pyramid upon pyramid of books which will form
the catalogue, “Mon enfant, quarante siècles te regardent du haut de ces
Livres /*—and the student will be struck dumb at the stupendous labour
i. his forefathers, and will look up to that catalogue as the Sphinx of
is times.
MEAGRE DIET.
It is declared that SoYER must have prepared the new Prussian
Diet, for it is so like his soup—there's nothing in it.
THE SIN OF STEALING SEVEN TURNIPS.
Could not some society be established for the encouragement of
thought and reflection among country magistrates ? To send a man to
gaol is a serious thing; but, apparently, their rural worships think little
of it. The daily papers inform us, that, at Exeter, last week, one John
SHUTE was convicted of having stolen seven turnips, the property of
WILLIAM ABBAHAM KEATs, his master. Whereupon,
“Mr. Justic; WILLIAMs said, it was a sad thing to see a man, like the prisoner, stand-
ing at the bar for stealing a few turnips; he had already been in prison for nearly a
month, and the sentence of the Court was that he should be imprisoned two days.
“Mr. WHYTE, who conducted the case for the prosecution, said that a man had been
set to watch the turnips, in consequence of former depredations, and the prisoner was
caught in the fact. t
“Mr. Justics Williams said the man had been subject to all the contamination of a
gaol for stealing three or four turnips. He had only 9s. a week.”
We are sorry when any men, meritorious of contempt and execration,
aredefrauded of their rightful due, since their loss is also the loss of society.
We regret, therefore, that our contemporaries did not publish the names
of the magistrates who committed this poor man to prison for stealing a
few turnips. Stealing do we say? Was it so * This poor ſellow “had
only 9s, a week.” His income, perhaps, was little more than that of the
members of a certain society, who, passing through a corn-field, and
being hungry—as men with nine shillings a week sometimes are–
plucked the ears of corn and did eat. Was that stealing * This did
they, moreover, on the Sabbath-day. There was one among them who,
had their act been flagitious, would, we presume, have reproved it, yet
did. He not so. This occurrence took place a long way off, and a good
while ago; it happened in Judea, in the early part of the first Christian
century. Had it taken place in Devonshire in the year 1847, it might
have given occasion for the comments of MR. Justice WILLIAMs.
THE GREATEST AGITATOR IN THE WORLD.
HE German papers inform us, that before
the letters-patent of the KING of PRussia
respecting the estates were published in
Berlin, they were sent at full length to the
EMPEROR of Russia and the PRINCE MET
TERNICH. It would be a great saving, we
think, to have electric telegraphs connect-
ing the government offices of Vienna, St.
Petersburgh, and Berlin. By these means
of rapid communication, FREDERick might
º -- ask the advice of METTERNich and the
|Wººl! permission of Nicholas before he entered
º All upon any new law, and messengers, car-
º *º riers, despatches, protests and protocols,
- and such slow things, be all dispensed with.
The links which have long connected those three courts would be
literally strengthened, and one half of Europe would be laid under
their secret influence. We wonder Louis-PHILIPPE, in his desire
to remove the distance between France and England, has not pro-
posed long ago, as the best means of making both ends meet, to
establish an electric telegraph between Neuilly and Osborne House.
By these means he might correspond with Victor LA, sending her a line
every day, and with a clever set of instruments, and by working the
oracle well, might eventually have the whole of England under his
thumb. Who knows 2—the crafty ULYsses may have in his hand some
day the strings which pull all the thrones of Europe (he has already
got Russia by a golden link, and Spain by a family tie), and ultimately
he may drive four-and-twenty kings as easily as WAN AMBURGH
drives the same number of horses It is quite awful to think that
the little finger of such a man might agitate the entire globe.

| 142 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
-
THE CHAMBER OF HORRORS.
WHILE every other branch of MADAME Tussaud's Exhibition is being
enriched by “magnificent additions,” it is a startling fact that the
Chamber of Horrors has remained in statu quofor a considerable period.
It is true, we have not lately had any Fieschis, with their infernal
machines, or HAREs and Burkes with their cold-blooded atrocities, to
furnish subjects for this department of the interesting collection of
MADAME Tessaud ; we think, however, the enterprising and in-
genious proprietor might meet with a new set of horrors in the present
day, quite fit to take their place beside the darker horrors of an
earlier period.
There are other tortures besides those of which her chamber fur-
nishes so many wondrous
specimens. Where, for in-
stance, could a finer subject
be found for a Chamber of
Horrors than the illustrious
Punch in the excruciating
agony of endeavouring to elu-
cidate a joke just received
from a Scotch humourist Ž
Those only who know what
it is to endure the infliction
of a bit of alleged fun, reeking
hot from Auld Reekie, may
form some conception of the
tortures endured by Punch in
opening a letter, and finding
it to contain a Caledonian
witticism. Surely this would
afford a powerful subject for
a “magnificent addition” to
MADAME Tussaud's Chamber
of Horrors. The miseries of official life are also wonderfully suggestive
of figures for the same portion of the Baker Street Wax-work. What
a picture of highly wrought
wretchedness could be produced
by a figure of a Government
clerk, when, having read through
the newspaper, he finds his day's
“occupation gone,” and delivering
himself up to the torments of
ennui, he becomes a prey to
horrors of the most desolating
description : How magnificent
would be the effect of one har-
rowing blank delineated faithfully
in the features of the melancholy
object, who might be supposed to
sigh in vain for one official note
to write, one official envelope to
open If this is not a subject for
the Chamber of Horrors, where
shall we look for matter worthy
of filling that gloomy apartment 2
But to go higher in the scale of
official existence, we may find in
the career of the Premier himself sufficient subject for the Chamber we
have been alluding to. Fancy the agony of poor Lord John Russell
at the moment of being
- persecuted by a deputa-
tion, asking him for the
hundred - and - ninetieth
time the perplexing ques-
tion, What is to be done
with Ireland? We are sure
that the active MADAME
T. will take our hint, and
supply the omissions in
her Chamber of Horrors
as speedily as possible.
A SITE AT LAST.
At length the Welling-
ton Statue will be placed
on a site that must satisfy
the grumblers. In the very
handsomest manner, a
- piece of ground has been
|allotted to it in their own
property, by the proprie-
tors of the Thames Tunnel.
THE SOLDIER AND HIS POST.
We are informed by our contemporary, the Morning Post, that
“some people will go tinkering everybody's kettle,” and that one of
such people is MR. Fox MAULE. The kettle which, according to the
Post, Mr. MAULE has gone tinkering, is the British Army, for changing
the system of enlistment wherein, he has introduced a bill into Par-
liament. By this measure it is proposed to limit the period of enlist-
ment, in the case of the cavalry to twelve, in that of the infantry to ten
years; at the expiration of which terms, the soldier shall have the
option of re-enlisting for similar periods. This proposal is described
by the Morning Post as an “outrageously absurd scheme"—its outra-
geous absurdity, in our contemporary's opinion, consisting, we presume,
in the supposition, that, after ten or twelve years' experience of a soldier's
life, a man could possibly wish to remain in the army.
Does the Morning Post, then, mean to say that the British soldier's is
such a miserable existence that no one voluntarily would consent to
lead it 2 Is not the soldier well paid, well lodged, well cared for 2 is
not the life which he hazards for his country rendered as comfortable
as possible while it lasts 2 Can the description of it given by the re-
cruiting serjeant—under the sanction of officers and gentlemen—be a
statement of the thing which is not Then, what absurdity is there
so very outrageous in the idea that the enjoyment of this delightful life
might probably tempt men to continue in it? :
If the soldier—to our national infamy—is a hopeless drudge, a
mechanic slave, ill-treated, ill-requited, the measure of MR. Fox
MAULE certainly would in itself be impolitic enough. In that case it
would be better to do away with the enlistment system altogether, and
sentence criminals to the army instead of to the hulks. But suppose—
fact, MR. MAULE's bill might easily be rendered quite feasible. This
might be readily done by the simple expedient of making re-enlistment
worth the soldier's while.
In the meanwhile, let the Morning Post consider that the measure is
Sibthoºr. If it were really so very absurd, would not the fact be
rather the reverse 2
PUNCH'S LAW REPORTS,
Re THE STATUE.-Er parte PUNCH.
This is another legal point arising out of the position of the Wel-
lington Statue. The question arose on an application made by MR.
BRIEFLEss to Vice-CILANCELlor KNight BRUCE, praying His Honour to
grant an injunction to restrain the Beadle of Piccadilly from removing
the horse to the pound, which had been threatened to be done, unless
the Statue should be taken out of the Beadle's jurisdiction.
His Honour could not see how he was to entertain the application.
The Statue stood in this position :-The horse was in possession of the
arch as a tenant at will, not in tail, though the tail had not been cut
off; but still the Duke, being on the horse, and remaining after his term,
was legally in as the remainder-man.
MR. BRIEFLess hoped His Honour would see that if the Beadle
made himself the casual ejector, and ejected the Statue at once as a
trespasser ab initio, another locus standi must be found for it.
His Honour.—“Why, really, MR. BRIEFLEss, the difficulty is to find
a locus standi for the Statue at all. You are quite right in your law, as
you always are—that the tail is not yet cut off; but it has been laid
down, as you are of course aware, that there cannot be a use upon a
use. Now, here we have abuse upon abuse; for both the Statue and
the arch, one of which is on the other, have come in for their share
of this commodity.”
MR. BRIEFLEss-“Then perhaps your Honour would advise us to
go at once to the Court of Arches?”
His Honour — “Exactly so, and in the meantime let the Statue
stand over for further directions.”

where they are mostly passed are the Quadrant, Regent Street, and
Leicester Square. They are recognised directly by a very brassy look,

The three specimens shown above represent our portrait when

ballad was appended to the specimens which we have given above :-

Then off the whiskers fly.
That nose I loved to gaze upon,
That bold and manly brow,
Are vanish'd, fled, completely gone—
Alas ! where are they now Ż
Thy hair, which once was black and bright,
Much worse than grey has grown;

For 't has completely flown.

And serves its fickleness to prove,
For soon 'tis all wiped out.

Have vanished as affection flies—
Alas !—where is it now Ż

FAIR IN THE TEIAMES TUNNEL.
| " We are every now and then hearing of a fair having been held in
the Thames Tunnel ; we confess we do not understand how such a
| festivity cal. eachieved in a place resembling a continuous succession
of coal-cellars. We should as soon think of giving a fête champétre
in our own dust-hole, or a matinée musicale in our largest water-butt.
How is it possible that Richardson could invite the public to walk up,
or Wombwell, exclaim “Alive alive l" in reference to his elderly
animals, with any chance of producing a good effect, when the whole
scene is in utter darkness, and one can scarcely grope about without
the fear of knocking one's head with violence against the ceiling 2 A
Fair in the Thames Tunnel seems to us as good an illustration of a
“pig in a poke” as we ever met with in the course of our porcine
experience. We perceive that the Wizard of the North was in
attendance. The presence of the “Wizard of the Wave” would have
been far more appropriate. All fair and above board is well enough,
but a fair under ground is an anomaly of the most grievous character.
virtues 7 We were not aware, however, until DR. PHILPott told us,
that the virtues have their aristocracy. We recommend the publica-
tion of a sort of moral peerage, by which the princely may be dis-
tinguished from the ducal, the ducal from the merely baronial, and the
baronial from those virtues of a low and plebeian character.
We always thought that virtus sola was a mobilitas in itself; but it
appears that we have been cruelly misinformed by the pedagogues who
led out our young ideas upon their first shooting excursion through the
rich preserves of classical literature. We do not wonder that a man
of such “princely virtues” as the DUKE of North UMBERLAND, one
whose rank in the peerage of morality was higher even than his position
in the pages of BURRE,--we are not surprised, we say, that such a man
should have been “deeply regretted by all the members of the Uni-
versity.” But now comes the illustration of the height of humbug,
which forms the title of our article.
of a prince, DR. PHILPoTT added– -
“Your Royal Highness's acceptance of our Chancellorship has raised us from the
grief which the loss of that excellent nobleman occasioned.”
Directly the Prince became Chancellor, the tears of the University
were dried up in the sunshine; or, rather, His Royal Highness has
become a sort of mop to absorb the moisture from the face of Cam-
bridge. After losing a Chancellor with the title of Duke and the
virtues of a Prince: nothing under a real, not merely a virtual Prince,
could console the afflicted University. Dr. PHILPoTT hopes that
the Institutions which His Royal Highness has honoured with his
connexion may be found “not unworthy” of his care. We hope not,
indeed –It would be a sad thing if one of the two greatest Univer-
sities in the greatest country in the world, should turn out, after all,
unworthy of the association of a Prince of the house of Coburg.
Nothing in England has been thought too good for the members of
this happy family; but, really, it is rather too humiliating when we

of rayther a fillosophical charickter Overhaulen the Times news-

in a leaky state, with a complement of 17 hands, 8 out of the lot upon

your Honour, I've nothin to say agin temperance, which I take to be
the drinkin of spirituous lickers in moderation. But what I do say is,
that it won't answer to knock a sailor off his grog. 'Tis my notion
that everything in this here world has got some use or another. The
use of grog I take to be to keep up what the doctors calls the cerkela-

cold and wet, go aloft, and keep watch in all weathers, requires their

reg'lar, as often as they can get it. By this rule your Honour will see
that I looks upon grog as a medicine, in which pint I agrees with the
teetotallers, for even they allows it to be taken medicinally. But
then I argyfy that 'tis a kind of physic that a sailor is always in want
of, more or less. He should take it for prewention, which is better
than cure ; and the melancholy condition of the bark Stirling, shows
the consequences of neglecting this wise precaution.

which Cambridge has endured at the loss of the Duke with the virtues

THE GENIUS OF BAVARIA.
A coloss AL statue is about to be erected at Munich, of the Genius of
Bavaria. We have not yet heard what is to be the design of this
interesting work of art, but we think the sketch we subjoin will furnish
an admirable idea to the intended sculptor. “LoLA and Liberty” is
now the cry throughout Bavaria, and despotism is being danced down
beneath the feet of Montes. The King, drawn into the pas de fascina-
tion, is following in the footsteps of his favourite ballerina, whose statue
deserves to be inaugurated as the Genius of Bavaria.
APPROACHING ELECTION.
MR. Cochrane, the real Wandering Minstrel, will shortly give a
grand entertainment to the electors of Westminster. Admission gratis.
The performances will consist of two parts.
PART The FirsT.
“I’ve been roaming, I've been roaming”— Why did I love? "-
“For many roving years.” “The Light Guitar.”
“I remember, I remember "- A Grand Catch from the Beggars' Opera.
“The Minstrel Boy.”
PART THE Second.
“Yegentlemen of England"—
“who'll buy my pretty ballads.” (In cha-
racter.)
“Do but pledge me"—
“1'll sing thee the songs I love."
-- ºld me discourse"—
“Here's a bumper to thee."
“o do not blame him "-
“His voice was ever true."
“o did youne'er hear of "&c.—
“The Pilgrim of Love.”
The whole to conclude with a Grand Scena from the Wanderer, and
recollections of a Musical Scamper through England. .

A REAL admirer for “the Statue” has been found at last. The
intelligent Hindoo who sweeps the crossing by the arch says, “He
“COMING THE SPANISH.”
THE EARL of CLARENDoN has let out the secret of the Spanish Bonds.
He said in the House of Lords that the dividends were never met, owing
to the number of revolutions in Spain, which prevented the payment.
We can understand now the object of so many revolutions in that
revolutionary country. Rarely does a year pass without there being
at least four. It is evident that, as soon as dividend-day draws high,
the Minister of the Finances takes a peepinto the Exchequer, and, upon
finding that there is only sufficient money to pay the troops, CHRusTixa,
himself and the ministers, he submits to his colleagues the expediency
of getting up a revolution immediately to upset the government.
Accordingly, orders to that effect are sent off to the Basque provinces,
a few guns are fired, a tremendous conspiracy is detected, a quantity
of spurious papers are seized, one or two poor devils—Carlists probably
—are arrested, and a most flaming accountappears, with all the horrors,
in the ministerial papers. These manoeuvres of course have their effect.
The funds fall; a four-and-twenty hours' panic is produced ; and notice
is sent off to London that it is impossible to pay the dividends of the
Spanish Bonds, on account of the awful revolution which has unex-
pectedly broken out, and not left a single real in the treasury. We
can imagine these events are now so regular that they are calculated
beforehand, like the eclipses, and that the Spanish pocket-books contain
notices like the following:—
April 1st.—Spanish Bonds payable. A Quarterly Revolution becomes due.
June 21st.--Dividend due on Spanish Bonds. Holiday at all the Government offices,
in consequence of an “attempt to overthrow the throne at Madrid.”
September 29th-Grand Revolution begins. Bank closed. Usual notices to be served
on the Spanish Bond-holders, that there is no dividend.
December 21st.—Spanish Bonds due. New Revolution rises 5h. 3m., sets 4h. 2m.
ºr Failure of the Bank. Dividends on Spanish Bonds end. Jubilee
a - º
And thus regularly four times a year does CHRISTINA and her
proud ministers “come the Spanish” over us. It must be so agreeable
to settle a bill with a revolution—so easy to discharge £70,000,000 with
a few guns! We wonder Greece, Philadelphia, Mexico, Holland, the
Thames Tunnel, and everything and everybody owing money to the
English government, do not get up revolutions. They might be
announced a week in advance in the newspapers, and, if got up
liberally, would certainly draw. We make a present of the idea to
the spirited proprietor of the Surrey Zoological Gardens. A revolution
in the Thames Tunnel, continued for three days, would, we are positive,
be an immense hit.
MONSIEUR SHAKSPEARE.
ER MAJESTY, says the Observateur
Français, “arrived in town at six
o'clock, and at eight o'clock was in her
box at the French plays.” This extra-
ordinary interest for the French Drama
might be turned to very good account.

Any of our dramatists, who are so well
skilled, from constant practice, in the
French language, could translate them ; or, if that was all, MossIEUR
Alexandre DUMAs would not mind improving “le vieur Billy” for a
royal audience. The experiment is worth trying, if it be only for
the novelty of seeing “By Desire,” with the royal arms, on an English
play-bill.

TO THE NATION.
N many accounts the readers of
Punch–Imean the nation at large
—must have felt gratified at the
promptitude with which the Com-
mander-in-Chief has complied
with H. R. H. PRINCE ALBERT's
application on behalf of a deserv-
ing public servant.
My boy, ALBERT ERNEST Punch,
Gent., was gazetted on Friday last
to a cornetcy, by purchase, in the
naburgh's Own, vice SoMERSET
SNoBBY, who retires.
The regiment is at present in
Ireland, its head-quarters being at
! Kilmichalog, County Kerry.
I have made all the inquiries
in my power respecting the cha-
* racter of LIEUT. ColoneL Lord
SwishTAIL, the Commanding Offi-
cer of the 122nd, to whose pater-
nal care Judy and I are about to
confide our darling child, and it
is most gratifying to our feelings
to learn that he stands remark-
ably high at the Horse Guards.
Irecollect him at school, twenty-
five years ago, when he was the
HoN. John Towzle: he was then
merely notorious for being the
greatest bully and the most hopeless dunce in his class, but as he has since
passed with much credit through the mysterious alembic of military
life, and as F. M. the DUKE of WELLINGron informed the civil autho-
rities,of the ancient town of Ballybunnion, in a terse note—when they
complained of Lord Swishtail for what they presumed to call his
egregious stupidity, and brutality during the late food riots—“that
122nd Hussars, the Bishop of Os-
coerce the starving peasantry of Kerry; or whether a close-fitting suit
of cloth, trimmed with fur, and a bear's-skin muff for a hat, open at
the top, with a crimson jelly-bag exuding therefrom, is a costume likely
to enhance the comfort of an officer under the broiling sun and heavy
dews of a tropical climate 7 No, no ; ALBERT ERNEst has been
|ººl upon-nobody but WIDDIconſBE could wear such a Tom-
fool's dress.
THE JEWISH CHAMPION.
MR. DisrAELI has written no less than three novels to further the
great cause of Jewish ascendancy, and to prove that the battle of the
Constitution is to be fought in Holywell Street. The clever littérateur
anticipates a golden age, should his views be carried out, but he forgets
that it is, after all, only an age of Mosaic gold that he is contending
for. After reading his last work of Tancred, we took quite a fresh
view of all the itinerant sons of Israel whom we met in the streets of
the Great Metropolis. “Look at that old clothes-man,” said we to
ourselves; “who would think that the unmixed blood of Caucasus runs
through the veins of that individual who has just offered us nine-pence
for our penultimate hat, and is refusing to give us ten-pence for our
pºpu-rerect or rather more than finished and done for, high-
OWS p *
It is evident that MR. DisrAELI has determined in his own mind,
that until there is a Mosaic Parliament, sitting in Rag Fair, the
object of his great mission will be unaccomplished. We shall begin to
suspect that MR. DisrAELI is the poet of Moses AND SoN's Establish-
ment, and that “Costume Castle” is to be the foundation-stone of a
new Jerusalem, removed from over the way, that is to say, from the
other side of the world, for the convenience of business. The Jews are
sharp fellows no doubt, and many of them are very amiable, excellent
people ; but we wish MR. DisBAELI would reform the errors of his
|favourite race, before he calls upon us to succumb entirely to its
influence. How is it that Jew-manufactured-clothes always tumble to
pieces and wear out in no time? that pencils purchased of the Jews are
ninety-nine parts stick to one part lead 7 that oranges bought of the
Jews are eleven bad to one good 7 that Mosaic jewellery is an imposi-
tion altogether? and that if you give an old coat to a Jew for a canary,
the bird is sure to have the pip, the hooping cough, or the mumps ?
Lºut.-Col. Lond Swishtam, was one of the most valuable Hussar |How is it that a Jew attorney is the worst of his class? and a Jew's-

worthless,” it would be unreasonable in me to doubt a fact so credibly never bring it back again? or sell you sets of jugs which you find upon
attested.
I therefore give our rulers great credit for making a first-rate leader
of horse out of such very indifferent materials as big JAck Towzle
used to be composed of when he was in the habit of compelling me, by
dint of severe pummelling, to do his exercises for him, and regard
ALBERT ERNest as truly fortunate in commencing his career under so
renowned a man.
SIR FRedekick TRENch assures me that he is considered to handle
troops, magnificently in the field. The interior economy of his regi-
ment he leaves almost entirely to his adjutant, LIEUTENANT NoseBAG,
an obsolete Peninsular veteran, who keeps it in capital order.
I understand that soon after Lord SwishTAI, entered the army,
being quartered in Galway, he accepted the hospitality of the O'Tooie

first glance been—-though the jugs have—rivetted 2
|DiskAELI will clear up these few little matters, outstanding, by no
means on the credit side, in our account with the Jews, we may begin
to join him in his demand for Mosaic Institutions, to replace those we
at present live under.
DINING BY DEPUTY.
We learn from the local papers, that one day last week, “the Mayor
of Liverpool gave a dinner to the high sheriff, the grand jury, and the
élite of the Bar, on behalf of the Bar.” This is certainly a new appli-
|cation of the legal doctrine on the subject of principal and agent.

MUSICAL CRITICISMS.
ositiveLY we have a very
sincere admiration for
the learned musical criti-
cisms of our contempo-
raries, which are evi-
dently written by men
who understand their
business ; and our only
regret is, that we cannot
come up to them in that
scientific acquaintance
which they display with
the subject of their
notices. There is, how-
ever, no knowing what
we can do till we try,
as we were once re-
minded by a sage of our
acquaintance, who, being
asked if he could play on the violin, modestly replied, that
“he did not know, for he had never attempted it.” In the
same humble spirit, we confess that we do not know, until
- we positively make the attempt, whether we can compete
SS with those learned and elaborate criticisms on music with
* which the best conducted of our daily and weekly con-
- temporaries now favour us. We will, however, plunge
boldly into the effort, and though we will not go at once at such very
high game as the Philharmonic, we will take for our theme one of those
street concerts at which we are very frequent visitants. Here goes
... We attended, on Monday evening last, one of those cheering réunions
in Coventry Street, which owe their existence to the energy of the
celebrated virtuoso BlowAway, whose fame on the trombone is quite
metropolitan. These meetings may be considered as now firmly
established ; and there is an indescribable charm about them, for they
combine the graces of a fête champêtre with the most delicious banquet
of harmony. The executants stand in a line, the audience forming a
complained of in those great musical meetings at the Hanover Square,
and other rooms hitherto confined to concert purposes.
The programme of Monday was not merely promising, but it was
pºsitively luscious. It offered a rich treat to the scholar and the mere
dilettante, for this has been the happy medium always hit by BLowAway.
The first piece was a Polka in A, B, C, from the Hop 82 of JULLIEN.
Every note of this was deliciously rendered by the executants. Every
*tuoso knows what an ophycleide is in the mouth of Brown, and on
this occasion it was more remarkable than ever for breadth and large-
ness. TUNKs on the triangle exhibited all the wonderful scholarship
with which he invariably touches that tender instrument. We rather
trembled for him in the magnificent scherzo, but he came out gloriously,
and his fellow executants winked their approbation, in the true spirit
of artists who are beyond all professional jealousy.
. Blowaway's trombone passages were almost appalling from their
intensity. He threw out his instrument to its fullest extent in the
stupendous largo, until we fancied we were in the presence of some
mighty magician who was overwhelming us with some potent spell,
which it was almost impossible to stand against. Rumble was a little
uncertain on the drum, as if he were nervous at the outset in attacking
such a work as JULLIEN's Hop 82; but he soon warmed up, and made
the parchment tell gloriously in the stretta, though his drumstick
became a little flat towards the end, from excess of energy. Tweed LE

Here we regret to say our criticism is brought to a close by the
abrupt termination of the concert. A sudden movement in A, of the

Pointment of the dilettanti, who were reluctantly compelled to separate.
PUNCH*S PRIZE NOWELISTS.
GEORGE DE BARNWELL.-WOL. II.
BY SIR. E. L. B. L. B. B. L. L. B B B. L. L. L., BART.
WE have selected the following episodical chapter in preference to
any relating to the mere story of GEoRGE BARNweLL, with which
most readers are familiar.
Up to this passage (extracted from the beginning of Vol. ii.) the
tale is briefly thus :—
That rogue of a MILLwood has come back every day to the
grocer's shop in Chepe, wanting some sugar, or some nutmeg, or some
figs, half-a-dozen times in the week.
She and GEORGE DE BARN well have vowed to each other an
eternal attachment.
This flame acts violently upon GEoRGE. His bosom swells with
ambition. His genius breaks out prodigiously. He talks about the
Good, the Beautiful, the Ideal, &c., in and out of all season, and is
virtuous and eloquent almost beyond belief—in fact like DEveREUx,
or P. CLIFFoRD, or E. ARAM, Esquires.
Inspired by MILLwood & LovE, GEoRGE robs the till, and mingles
in the world which he is destined to ornament. He outdoes all the
dandies, all the wits, all the scholars, and all the voluptuaries of the
age—an indefinite period of time between QUEEN ANN and GEoRGE
II.-dines with CURLL at St. John's gate, pinks Colonel CHARTERIs
in a duel behind Montague House, is initiated into the intrigues of
the CHEvaLIER St. GEORGE, whom he entertains at his sumptuous
pavilion at Hampstead, and likewise in disguise at the shop in
Cheapside.
His uncle, the owner of the shop, a surly curmudgeon with very
little taste for the True and the Beautiful, has retired from business to
the pastoral village in Cambridgeshire from which the noble BARN-
wells came. GEORGE's cousin ANNABEL is, of course, consumed with
a secret passion for him,
Some trifling inaccuracies may be remarked in the ensuing brilliant
little chapter ; but it must be remembered that the author wished to
present an age at a glance; and the dialogue is quite as fine and correct
as that in the “Last of the Barons,” or in “Eugene Aram,” or other
works of our author, in which Sentiment and History, or the True and
the Beautiful, are united.
CHAP. XXIV.
BUTTON'S IN PALL MALL.
Those who frequent the dismal and enormous Mansions of Silence
which society has raised to Ennui in that Omphalos of town, Pall
Mall, and which, because they knock you down with their dullness,
are called Clubs no doubt; those who yawn from a bay-window in St.
James's Street, at a half-score of other dandies gaping from another
bay-window over the way ; those who consult a dreary evening paper
for news, or satisfy themselves with the jokes of the miserable Punch,
by way of wit ; the men about town of the present day, in a word,
can have but little idea of London some six or eight score years back.
Thou pudding-sided old dandy of St. James's Street, with thy lackered
boots, thy dyed whiskers, and thy suffocating waistband, what art
thou to thy brilliant predecessor in the same quarter? The Brougham
from which thou descendest at the portal of the Carlton or the Travel-
lers', is like everybody else's ; thy black coat has no more plaits, nor
buttons, nor fancy in it than thy neighbour's ; thy hat was made on
the very block on which LoRD ADDLEPATE's was cast, who has just
entered the Club before thee. You and he yawn together out of the
same omnibus-box every night; you fancy yourselves men of pleasure;
you fancy yourselves men of fashion ; you fancy yourselves men of
taste; in fancy, in taste, in opinion, in philosophy, the newspaper legis-
lates for you ; it is there you get your jokes, and your thoughts, and
your facts and your wisdom—poor Pall Mall dullards. Stupid slaves
of the Press, on that ground which you at present occupy, there were
men of wit and pleasure and fashion, some five-and-twenty lustres ago.
We are at Button's—the well-known sign of the Turk's Head. The
crowd of periwigged heads at the windows—the swearing chairmen

London's Wit and Fashion. It is the corner of Regent Street. Carlton Presently, and with a graceful salute to the Society, he quitted the
House has not yet been taken down.
A stately gentleman in crimson velvet and gold is sipping chocolate
at one of the tables in earnest converse with a friend whose suit is
likewise embroidered, but stained by time, or wine mayhap, or wear.
A little deformed gentleman in iron-grey is reading the Morning
Chronicle newspaper by the fire, while a divine, with a broad brogue
and a shovel hat and cassock is talking freely with a gentleman, whose
star and riband, as well as the unmistakeable beauty of his Phidian
countenance, proclaims him to be a member of Britain's aristocracy.
Two ragged youths, the one tall, gaunt, clumsy, and scrofulous;
the other with a wild, careless, beautiful look, evidently indicating
Race, are gazing in at the window, not merely at the crowd in the
celebrated Club, but at TIMorhy, the waiter, who is removing a plate
of that exquisite dish, the muffin, (then newly invented,) at the desire
of some of the revellers within.
“I would, SAM, said the wild youth to his companion, “that I had
some of my Mother MaccLesºmeLD's gold, to enable usto-eat of those
eates and mingle with yon-springalds and beaux.”
“To vaunt a knowledge of the stoical philosophy,” said theyouth
addressed as SAM, “might elicit a smile of ineredulity upon the cheek
of the parasite of pleasure; buttthere are moments in life when His-
tory fortifies endurance: and past study renders present deprivation
more bearable. If our pecuniary resources be exiguous, let our-reso-
lution, Dick, supply the deficiencies of Fortune. The muffin we desire
to-day would little benefit us to-morrow. Poor and hungry, as we
are, are we less happy, Dick, than yon listless voluptuary who ban-
quets on the food which you covet?”
And the two lads turned away up Waterloo Place, and past the
Parthenon Club-house, and disappeared to take a meal of cow-heel at
a neighbouring cook's shop. Their names were SAMUEL Johnson and
Richard SAvAGE.
Meanwhile the conversation at BUTToN's was fast and brilliant.
“By Wood's thirteens, and the divvle go wid 'em,” cried the Church
dignitary in the cassock, “is it in blue and goold ye are this morn-
ing, SIR Richard, when you ought to be in seebles 2"
“Who's dead, DEAN ?” said the nobleman, the dean's companion.
“Faix, mee LARD Bolingbroke, as sure as mee name's JonATHAN
Swift—and I'm not so sure of that neither, for who knows his father's
name 2—there's been a mighty cruel murther committed entirely. A
child of Dick Steele's has been barbarously slain, dthrawn, and quar-
thered, and it's Joe Addison yondther has done it. Ye should have
killed one of your own, Joe, ye thief of the world.”
“I ?” said the amazed and RIGHT Honour ABLE Joseph ADDIson ;
“I kill Dick's child ! I was God-father to the last.”
“And promised a cup and never sent it,” Dick ejaculated. Joseph
looked grave.
“The child I mean is SIR Roger DE CoverLEY, KNIGHT AND
BARoNet. What made ye kill him, ye savage Mohock The whole
town is in tears about the good knight; all the ladies at Church this
afternoon were in mourning; all the booksellers are wild; and LINTot
says not a third of the copies of the Spectator are sold since the death
of the brave old gentleman.” And the DEAN of St. PATRIck's
pulled out the Spectator newspaper, containing the well-known
passage regarding SIR Roger's death. “I bought it but now in
“Wellington-street,” he said ; “the news-boys were howling all down
the Strand.”
“What a miracle is Genius—Genius, the Divine and Beautiful,” said
a gentleman leaning against the same fire-place with the deformed
cavalier in iron-grey, and addressing that individual, who was in fact
MR. ALEXANDER Pope, “what a marvellous gift is this, and royal
privilege of Art I To make the Ideal more credible than the Actual :
to enchain our hearts, to command our hopes, our regrets, our tears,
for a mere brain-born Emanation : to invest with life the Incorporeal,
and to glamour the cloudy into substance,—these are the lofty
privileges of the Poet, if I have read poesy aright ; and I am as
familiar with the sounds that rang from HomeR's lyre, as with
the strains which celebrate the loss of Beli NdAs lovely locks,
(MR. Pope blushed and bowed, highly delighted)—“these, I say, sir,
are the privileges of the Poet—the Poietes—the Maker—he moves the
world, and asks no lever; if he cannot charm death into life as
ORPHEUs feigned to do, he can create Beauty out of Naught, and defy
Death by rendering Thought Eternal. Ho! JEMMY, another flask of
Nantz.”
And the boy—for he who addressed the most brilliant company of
wits in Eurºpe was little more—emptied the contents of the brandy-
|flask into a silver flagon, and quaffed it gaily to the health of the
coffee-house, and was seen cantering on a magnificent Arab past the
National Gallery.
“Who is yon spark in blue and silver ? He beats JoE ADDIson,
himself, in drinking, and pious JoE is the greatest toper in the three
kingdoms,” Dick STEELE said good-naturedly.
“His paper in the Spectator beats thy best, Dick, thou sluggard,”
the Right Honour ABLE MR. Addison exclaimed. He is the author
of that famous No. 996, for which you have all been giving me the
credit.”
“The rascal foiled me at capping verses,” DEAN Swift said ; “and
won a tenpenny piece of me, plague take him 1"
“He has suggested an emendation in my “Homer,” which proves
him a delicate scholar,” MR. Pope exclaimed.
“He knows more of the French king than any man I have met
with; and we must have an eye upon him,” said Lord Bolingbroke,
then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and beckoning a suspi-
cious looking person who was drinking at a side-table, whispered to
him something.

are beginning to dis-

of being hired, from ten in the morning until three in the afternoon,
when ladies seeking situations will have a large choice of individuals
to select from. This step is considered necessary, on account of the
extreme difficulty experienced by those following the professions of
cooks, housemaids, nurses, scullions, &c., in suiting themselves with
places equal to their pretensions.
The following questions have been drawn up, which must be satis-
factorily answered by those masters and mistresses who are desirous of
securing the benefit of domestic assistance :-
1. Do you allow beer-money, and an unlimited supply of milk, so
that the former may be saved by the drinking of the latter 7
2. When you give out sugar for puddings or pies, are you particular
to a pound or two 7
3. When you have a joint at table, do you ever expect to see it
again under any circumstances whatever ?
4. How many cousins do you allow each servant to have in the
division of police that does duty in your neighbourhood 7
5. Do you consider “He is my cousin” a sufficient explanation of
6. Are you prepared to give a character half a dozen times over, in
the event of your situation, and five more after yours, being found

No master or mistress who cannot answer all these inquiries in a
most perfectly satisfactory manner, will on any account be treated
with by any lady in the domestic profession. Those persons who think
they will suit may apply at the new office.

THERE's trampling feet in Goswell Street, there's row on Holborn Hill,
There's crush and crowd, and swearing loud, from bass to treble shrill;
From grazier cad, and drover lad, and butcher shining greasy,
And slaughter-men, and knackers' men, and policemen free and easy.
'Tis Monday morn, and onward borne to Smithfield's mart repair
The pigs and sheep, and, lowing deep, the oxen fine and fair ;
They're trooping on from Islington, and down Whitechapel Road,
To wild halloo of a shouting crew, and yelp, and bite, and goad.
From combs of distant Devonshire, from sunny Sussex wold,
From where their Durham pastures the stately short-horns hold ;
From Herefordshire marches, from fenny Cambridge flat,
For London's maw they gather—those oxen fierce and fat.
The stunted stocks of Cambria's rocks uneasily are lowing,
With redder blaze of wild amaze their eyes around them throwing ;
And the unkempt stot of Galloway, and the Kyloe of the Mearns,
Whose hoof, that crush'd the heather tuft, the mild MACADAM spurns.
They may talk of plaza mayors, of toreros' nimble feat,
Of MonTEz, the famed matador, of picadors so fleet;
But what is Spanish bull-fight to the deeds that we can show,
When through the street, at all they meet, the Smithfield oxen go?
See there, see there, where high in air nursemaid and nursling fly
Into a first floor window, see, where that old gent. they shy :
Now they're bolting into parlours, now they're tumbling into cellars,
To the great disgust and terror of the peaceable indwellers. |
Who rides so meat down Chiswell Street P A city knight, I ween ;
By girth and span an alderman, nor less by port and mien.
Look out, look out ! that sudden shout ! the Smithfield herd is nigh ' |
Now turn, Sir Knight, and boldly fight, or more discreetly fly.
He hath eased round on his saddle, all fidgetty and fast;
There's another herd behind him, and the time for flight is past.
Full in his front glares a rabid runt, thro' tears of pain that blind him,
For the drover's almost twisted off the tail that hangs behind him. -
All lightly armed for such a shock was stout SIR CALIPEE,
The runt tears on, the rout is gone, the street is calm once more,
And to Bartlemy's they bear him, extended on a door;
Now, gramercy, good SIR CALIPEE, to the turtle and the haunch,
That padded out thy civic ribs and lined thy stately paunch.
But he couched his new umbrella, and “Police” aloud cried he l |No ribs are broke, but a shattering stroke thy system hath sustain'd :
Crash-smash—slap—dash! The whalebone snaps, the saddle-seat is |Any other than an alderman had certainly been brained.
| And soon as he had breath to swear, the knight right roundly swore
And the knight in mazy circles is flying thro' the air :
That straight he'd put down Smithfield and set up an abattoir.
THE FLOODS IN REGENT STREET. |
The roof of the Quadrant still remains “open to all, and influenced
by none.” The rain dribbles through as easily as if it were the roof of
Walbrook Church. Couldn't a few mackintoshes be spread over it 7
Anything to keep the wet out. The poor beadles are drenched with
every shower of rain. They look half drowned, and have the appear-
ance of a couple of beadles which had been purchased at RAINY's, the
auctioneer. It is a chilling mockery to see them walking about with
their staffs, when an umbrella over their heads would be of so much
more service to them. But if it is derogatory for a beadle to be
seen with an open gingham, there can be no objection to their being
invested with a mop each, and appointed surveyors of the numerous
pools which are supported by the voluntary contributions of every
shower that passes down Regent Street.
The water in the puddles overflows the gentlemen's boots, and swamps
the ladies' shoes in a manner that makes us believe that the cordon-
niers of the neighbourhood have an interest in keeping open roof in the
Quadrant. We should not wonder if the hatters, also, were concerned
in this attack on the heads and feet of the British public. It may do
very well for the foreigners who congregate under the Quadrant, but
for ourselves, we prefer sending our linen to a regular washerwoman's.
In the meantime, the Commissioners for the Improvement of the
Quadrant might advertise the place as a Bath and Wash-house for the
Million, admission gratis ; whilst the beadles might be authorised to
solicit subscriptions for the purchase of towels. |
RAILWAY CIRCUITS.
AMoNG the various evils of railways there is one which, to our
astonishment, has escaped the notice of Colonel SIBTHoRPE, namely,
the impairment of the dignity and style in which persons of consequence
were wont to travel. The Times tells us, that |
“So great has been the alteration in posting, in consequence of railways, that the judges
were obliged to be contented with a pair of horses each, from Liskeard to Bodmin.”
Such a derogatory mode of travelling as this is obviously calculated
to bring the judicial office into contempt. To cut a judge down to a
carriage and pair, is like shearing his wig. The four or six horses
with which, in the good old times, their lordships were wont to arrive
at an assize town, were among the chief causes of the veneration where-
with they were regarded. The equipage of the judge astonished the
natives of the rural districts. Hence, no less than from his very
robes, was the awfulness with which his person was invested in
their eyes. We propose, that since judges can no longer travel with
superfluous horses, they should be conveyed to their destination by
supernumerary engines. We would also have additional rails extended,
for a certain distance, along the road they arrive by, in order that the
Sheriff, in due state, may go out to meet them with his train, and
conduct them, with fitting solemnity, to the Hall of Justice.

PUNOHPS HISTORICAL PORTRAIT GALLERY.
Dr. JOHNSON.
This illustrious character, though in the other world, still takes that
nial interest in life and London, which set him frisking through Fleet
$treet, at four o'clock in the morning, while in the body. His faithful
Boswell, like the Indian's dog, “admitted to that equal sky “ ”
still bears him company,” and chronicles his sayings and doings as
faithfully as ever.
“Hearing that his portrait was about to be added to Punch's Gallery
of Illustrious Characters, I asked him,” writes the ghost of Boswell,
“what he thought of that periodical ?
“Sir” said he, “that hebdomadal publication is marked by a
humour which you are utterly unable to comprehend, and a wit tº
which your utmost efforts could never enable you to attain. Sir, I
like it vastly.” -- - >
“‘Don’t you think,' I ventured to remark, ‘that it is rather low ?
“His answer to this was, ‘Pooh, sir, you are a fool.' I inquired of
him if he thought Goldsmith would have contributed to Punch, had it
existed in our time. -
“‘Why, sir,’ he replied, “Goldy would no doubt have contributed,
but then he would have insisted on furnishing illustrations. Sir, I
should have contributed ''
“Upon this, of course, I was silent. Sometime after he returned to the
subject of his own accord. -
“Sir” said he, “Punch is a feature"of the present day, in which I
recognise much that RABELAIs failed to effect, and more than Swift
strove in vain to accomplish. To raise a laugh at the expense of sobriety
or virtue is easy; but to enlist MoMUs on the side of Morality is an
effort to which our times were unequal, and which, had I attempted, I
should no doubt have purchased popularity at the expense of dignity.
One thing, sir, I should have done. Sir, had I turned my pen to such a
purpose: I should have showed you up once a fortnight. Sir, you would
have been an admirable subject for Punch /* -
“Of course, although I could not see the truth of this, I did not
venture to dissent from my revered friend.”
A HINT TO BROUGHAM.
THE woolsack for the new House of Lords has printed on it in large
letters, “Licensed only to carry one.”
“THE RISING GENERATION ?” OF SMITHFIELD.
HockLEY-IN-The-Hole, according to the excellent authority of Mrs.
Peachem, in her advice to Filch, was the place to learn true breeding.
Schools of manners, however, shift their sites. According to a reso-
lution recently issued from Butchers' Hall, Smithfield is now the
chosen spot for the education of youth in all the humanities. Had it
been so in the time of ChestERFIELD, that superfine peer would
have written for his son, as his very best companion, A Guide to
Smithfield. The besetting sin of the world—the great vice of human
nature—is ingratitude. How many thousands of us never consider
how much we owe to butchers 1
Hall, was in the chair when the above-mentioned resolution was pro-
pounded, and gave his weight—true Leadenhall weight—to the
opinions enshrined in it. These opinions cut with the edge of a
cleaver—come down upon us with the weight of a pole-axe. The
“Rising Generation” are vitally concerned in the existence of Smith-
field Market for the transit of live cattle to the contiguous slaughter-
house. An Ox once spoke in the Forum. Listen to a Voice from
Butchers' Hall :—
“That it is essential that the cattle and dead meat markets should be contiguous, to
give the buyers every opportunity of purchasing their stock upon the most advantageous
terms, and thereby promoting the best interests of the public at large.”
Steaks and chops—for such is the subtle insinuation—are made
many pence in the pound cheaper to housekeepers when bought upon
the live animal in Smithfield. They would go up if made the exotics
of the suburbs. However, let us not forget the Rising Generation :-
“That the subject of housing, foddering, and slaughtering on the premises of the
owner is essential to the trade and to the rising generation.”
We know there is a prejudice for home education. Many folks
prefer that their little boys should learn their Greek and Latin under
the family roof, so that they may not risk their morals and their
jackets in the laxity and play-hour hubbub of a public school. In the
like manner the young butcher is held the purer for cutting a sheep's
throat at his own fireside. His manners would be roughened, and
perhaps his language partake too much of the Doric, were he unguard-
edly made to risk the vulgarity of the abattoir. Now, there can be
little doubt that the juvenile butcher of our time does, all unconsciously,
contract a gentleness of demeanour and a purity of speech from his
habit of seeing a bullock slaughtered in the bosom of a family.
He who would soar to the reputation of a great butcher—he whose
heart pants to become a GIBLETTs—must pass his days and nights in a
slaughter-house. His rule of life should be a line from King Lear
—“Kill ! kill I kill !” This truth is to be found in the resolution—
an evergreen piece of truth—stuck like a piece of Christmas holly
in prize suet.—
“It being indispensable for youth, in acquiring a competent knowledge and judgment
in live stock, to pass much of their time among slaughtering, it is of great importance to
the rising generation, whether as the sons, the apprentices, or youth generally, that
under the paternal and vigilant control of the principal, they should acquire knowledge
combined with morality, industry controlled by integrity, and general habits based on
humanity.” r
The son of a butcher—the apprentice of a butcher—is, it may be
expected, the butcher of the next generation. But how—for we wish
to learn—how are the “youth generally” of the metropolis affected
by the proposed abolition of Smithfield 2 We have it. The resolution,
doubtless, points to the “youth” to be usually found gathered about
the butcher's door when the obstinate sheep, snuffing the blood, refuse
to enter, until the butcher, with a habit “based on humanity,”
claws up the animal by its head and tail, and flings it over the
threshold. Then, again, there are of the “youth generally "who at
times attend as amateurs at the slaughter-house, and who may be
supposed to have a kind of prescriptive right to the show.
We are, however, mightily pleased, and certainly no less surprised,
at the inevitable combination of morality, industry, and integrity, with
habits of humanity, to be secured by killing at home. Henceforth—
at least as long as they are suffered to remain by a revolutionary
Legislature—henceforth, we shall never pass a private domestic
slaughter-house, without an instructive spiritual recognition of the
great human qualities nurtured and strengthened within. It would
seem that morals, like sugar, are refined by blood : that is, of the blood
of a private sticking-place.
Henceforth, the domestic butcher's boy will be to us a ruddy, carna-
tion-coloured student of the humanities. We shall feel the like
respect for his no hat that we now feel for the caps of Oxford and
Cambridge. Skewers themselves shall be to our eyes cuttings from
the Tree of Knowledge.
The thought will haunt us! How much we have all along owed to but-

Who knows how much of the courtesy an

London, though the Alderman may not know one of their names | For
instance, the young student, fresh and unctuous from his Academy,

Moily- the housemaid. There is an amenity of manner that the

a giggle into the kitchen, and the cook grins, and then the footman,

WINTER FOR EVER 1
On the first of April—as if to make April fools of those who thought
that SUMMER was really coming—Old WINTER popped his hoary head,
for the fourth time this year, down upon the metropolis. HIEMs has
been treating London as if it were the Strand Theatre, and has been
cutting up its one ordinary legitimate season into no less than half-a-
dozen, in the course of which he has made no less than six, positively
last, appearances. We shall not be at all surprised if, in the middle of
May, old HIEMs should be once more re-engaged for a limited period.
It is true he can at any time command overflowing houses, by his
celebrated Snow Scene, in the course of which he introduces “The
Storm, in character,” very effectually. The old saying of “only once a
year” will become perfectly obsolete, or inappropriate, as far as Christ-
mas is concerned, if we are to have so many repetitions of old. HIEMs's

We think that SPRING might fairly ask for an injunction to restrain
WINTER from trespassing on ground which he ought long since to have
vacated. All Nature's new and elegant stock gets damaged by the
destructive intrusion of which we complain, and the little buds pre-
paring to open on their own account, with an extensive assortment of
colours, are forced to shut up by the presence of their disagreeable
antagonist. An application Ex parte Flora v. HIEMs, would, we

MRS. NISBETT'S RETURN–PUNCH*S PROPHECY |

none more pleasing than the one-that promises the ap ce of MRs.
NISBETT on the Haymarket boards on Monday next. There she will
be once again, with her face ripe and rich as a peach in the sun, and
her mellow laughter, that “seems like honey melted in her throat.”
Now, though we may regret the cause that gives back the actress to
the stage, we cannot disguise our huge satisfaction at once more hav-
ing her. . Not that Punch is at all surprised—certainly not ; for
somehow, he knew it would happen, and in the year 1844 prophecied
the event. , Let the earnest and constant reader turn to page 21 of
Punch's eighth volume, and he will there find certain verses—(they were
dear LAMAN BLANCHARD's)—entitled, a “New Year's Ode to the
Winner of the St. Nisbett, Season 1844.” The last verse, it will be
found, contains this remarkable prediction:—-
“Who weds a mere beauty, dooms dozens to grieve; |
Who marries an heiress, leaves hundreds undone;
Who bears off an actress, (she never took leave),
Deprives a whole city of rational fun..
But, farewell the glances and nods of ST, Nisnºtt;

only account for it from this circumstance : there has been there no

THE MAMMOTH PRocession.
In consequence of the lessee of Drury Lane having taken advantage
of the streets of London to advertise his theatre, by sending a Mammoth
Procession of elephants and camels, Persian princes, Imaums, and others,
through the metropolis, it is expected that the proprietors of Richard-
son's Show will claim the same privilege. It is well known that a
tragedy of intense interest, called Rowena the Ruined; or, Brumaldi the
Brutal and Conrad the Crushed, is usually acted throughout the entireyear
at Richardson's Show ; and the following is the order of the procession
that will be selected for introducing to the metropolis the Mammoth
establishment for melodrame of intense interest. The following is in-
tended to be the order of procession:—
- THE PROPRIETOR,
on a velocipede, running backwards and forwards to clear the way, and
keep the route passable.
| Rowena the Ruined,
on a milk-white donkey, richly caparisoned with gorgeous trappings
from a four-post bedstead, long in the possession of the original
proprietor. -
- THE CELEBRATED GHOST,

slippers in which he appeared all last year to Macbeth, as he lay slain.
on the Field of Bosworth. -
THE LEADING TRAGEDIAN,
carrying the sword he planted in the bosom of Fandango the Faithless,
previous to the transition of that apostate into Pantaloon in the
Pantomime. -
IRichardson's Clown,
standing on one leg, and exclaiming, “Here we are l’” to nobody.
If the authorities do not interfere to prevenſt this—and there is no
reason why they should, after allowing the Mammoth Procession to
occupy the streets for nearly an entire day—it is expected that Wom B-
well will also attempt to get the benefit of an advertisement. We
may therefore expect a drove of wild beasts down the Strand, making
every man a WAN AMBURGH. in spite of himself; for he will have to
encounter the brutal procession. What is sauce for the goose, is how-
ever sauce for the gander ; and if all this outrageous puffing is good
for Drury Lane, it must be equally beneficial to the smaller establish-
ments. We think, however, “the Poet” had assumed a privilege in
blocking up the streets, and rehearsing his pageants, which will no

EMILY's eyes filled with fresh gushing dew. “Speak on, speak ever

as joyously as if it had been one of his early festals ; but the worthy
chaplain could scarcely eat it for tears.

“OUR LONDON CORRESPONDENT.”
UCH is the title under which various provincial
journals keep a contributor in town, whºse
duty it is to send a weekly column of exclu-

respondent is compelled to affect an acquaint:
circles; but as his sphere of observation is
confined to the limited circle of the tavern he
frequents, he is obliged to draw upon his imagi-
nation for the “facts” he furnishes to the pro-
vincial journal. It cannot be expected that
there will be much veracity in his statements,
but what they want in truth is made up in
audacity. Upon the strength of what he picks
up from his fellow reporters on the London
press, he has generally something to say about
the movements, intentions, engagements, or
non-engagements of the leading writers, about
whom he knows positively nothing. Occasion-
ally he has some grand scheme to communi-
cate with reference to the starting of a new
daily paper, which is to oppose every other
journal in existence, and is to be conducted by
everybody, who have all seceded from every-
thing else, for the purpose of putting every
possible and impossible strength into the new
enterprise. Proprietors, printers, publishers,
editors, coutributors, reporters, and indeed the entire establish-
ment, from the highest to the lowest, are said by “our London
Correspondent” to be on the point of abandoning profit, position,
character, and everything else, to start a wilful opposition to the paper
in which they all have a mutual interest.
When “our London Correspondent” is asked for his authority—
though it is seldom worth any one's while to do that—his announce-
ment of a new paper is found to rest on no foundation whatever. It
enabled him to fill up a portion of his required sheet, and he cannot
afford to be scrupulous as to the means of doing so.
“Our London Correspondent” is of course in the confidence of all
the Ministers and all the leading Members of the Opposition ; and yet,
upon his own showing, if his boast be true, he is betraying all the
secrets entrusted to him on all sides, for a few shillings a week from a
country newspaper. He knows that Lord John Russell will not be
in office another month at least four years before he goes out, and thus
“our London Correspondent” proves the access he has to very very
early—a little too early—intelligence. He can tell you who is to have
the next garter, when there is none vacant; and has seen letters from
JENNY LIND or MENDELsoHN, notwithstanding no letter has been
written by either of these illustrious individuals. - ***
In fact, “our London Correspondent” lives in a world of his own,
which enables him to see a great deal more than is seen by anybody
else ; and the best of it is, that there can be no witnesses to prove the
contrary of his assertions, for his facts are so truly original, that he
i. them all to himself, and no one else has an opportunity of meeting
them.
HEBREW MELODIES.
TheRE is no truth in the report that MR. Dise AELI's new novel is
being adapted for the Italian stage, and will be played with the
original music of Tancredi. We believe an eminent composer of the
Jewish persuasion is busy in arranging variations on themes taken
from Tancred, to be played on the Jew's harp, which cannot fail, with
the impulse MR. Dishaeli has given everything Caucasian, to be the
fashionable instrument, shortly, in everybody's mouth. A symphony
for six Jew's harps is making a deal of noise in the musical circles of
Houndsditch.
The Mendicity Market.
THE Eton Montem is abolished; so little boys who run away from
school and are caught begging, will, for the future, be taken up and
treated as good-for-nothing vagrants.-The Repeal Association is
reduced to its last penny. It is expected that the Kidderminster will
be hung out over the portico in a few days, and all the effects disposed
of. There is a great commotion amongst the buttermen, on account of
the greater part of the property consisting of the members' speeches.

English Opera House have not been able to ascertain yet the value of

ILLUSTRATED LAW BOOKS.
The rage for illustrated literature is now so universal, that scarcely
a book issues from the press without the aid of pictorial embellishment.
We are astonished that Illustrated Law Books have not yet been
added to the catalogue of pictorial publications, for there are certainly
many legal scenes to which the artist might impart the most lively
interest. The “Distraint for Rent” would admit of the most effective
treatment in the hands of a skilful illustrator, whose fancy might be
allowed to revel among tables and chairs in a particularly taking
manner. It would be easy to elevate the subject from its disagreeable
homeliness by placing the characters in the toga or table-cloth of
antiquity in the following fashion :-
Distitaint Fort Rent.
. An illustrated edition of Coke upon Littleton must become exceed-
ingly popular, for the illumination would help to throw a light upon
the obscurities of the work alluded to.
The peculiarly touching incident of “An Arrest for Debt” would
be very powerful in the hands of an artist with sufficient grasp to
enable him to seize his subject in a decided manner.

throughout England, would afford the most admirable point for the
painter; who might possibly be able to draw upon his own personal
experience for the original of the group he designed to pcrpetuate on
his canvas.
Perhaps, however, the finest subject for the six-pound paint-brush of
a Poussin, or any other master of the pictorial art, would be the por-
trait of that impassioned creature, BRIEFLEss, with his whole soul
wrapped up in a motion of course; as it always is when he is engaged
in making the most ordinary application. If it is only a compute that
he desires, his hands rise with the occasion, his brow contracts, and his
two pupils—the only two he ever had—flash forensic fire from his eyes,
and his whole appearance bespeaks the wild enthusiast. BRIEFLEss,
on such an occasion, seems to concentrate the whole dignity of the Bar
in his own person, and he has been known to wind up with the follow-
ing brilliant peroration—a la MACAULAY—when the compute has been
the subject cf his splendid eloquence:—
“No 1 I would rather dash from my head the housing of honourable
horsehair which forms a thatch to this poor, ill-furnished abode of my

stock, and crumple the cravat whose snowy whiteness rivals the driven
snow, or the carted ice.—Yes; I would submit even to this, before I

THE affairs of the Parish of Walbrook are in a disgraceful state ; no
less than 140 guineas are owing to the organist (a poor woman),
whilst the sextons have a claim upon the parish to the extent of £273.
The Parish should be summoned, and compelled under the new Act to
pay its debts. If it is too poor, then it should be made to go through
the Insolvent Debtors' Court. A whole parish being whitewashed
would be a stain upon every parishioner in it. We look upon
Walbrook as very little better than the Honourable Mr. WYNDHAM,
who achieved an infamous notoriety three months ago by contracting
debts, which he never intended to pay.
We wonder every house in the place is not ashamed of itself, for we
cannot imagine anything more shabby than being in debt to a sexton
The parish who would allow itself to be buried upon “tick,” is capable
of robbing its charity-children of their bread and butter. No mean-
ness would be too mean—no atrocity too atrocious for it. We suppose
marriages in Walbrook are performed only upon credit, and that the
clerk and beadle, when they ask for their fees at a christening, are
politely told to “chalk it up.” Shabby We should not at all be
surprised to hear that Walbrook had absconded some fine morning to
Boulogne. It would be a sad paragraph to read in the newspapers :—
“OUTLAwed.—The Parish of Walbrook, at the suit of its Sextons for £273.”
We hope some benevolent individuals will get up a penny
subscription, and, for the honour of British parishocracy, avert that
disgrace. We are sure ALDERMAN GIBBs, who was never behindhand
when money was concerned, will come forward, and liberally save the
character of Walbrook from being buried in its churchyard.
THE PHEASANT, THE PARTRIDGE, AND THE GOOSE.
A GAME-LAW FABLE.
A PHEAsANT from his cover flew
A neighbºring buckwheat-field into ;
Squire JENKINsoN the cover owns,
The field another Squire, call'd Jones.
On Jones's land a partridge bred,
Address'd the pheasant whilst he fed,
And after saying “How d'ye do *"
Inquired, “I say, whose bird are you?”
The pheasant “JENKINson's" replied,
“How so, my friend ?” the partridge cried.
“Why I,” returned the pheasant, “mate,
Was reared on JENkinson's estate,
In his preserve is fix'd my home;
So I am his where’er I roam.”
“No,” said the partridge, “you are not,
Now that on Jones's land you’ve got ;
And thus at once I will confute you :—
Jones has a lawful right to shoot you.”
The pheasant unto this demurr'd. .
And so the matter they referr'd :
For referee they sought a goose,
Nigh on a common grazing loose.
The goose, whose cackle we translate,
Thus solved the question in debate :-
“Three birds together, here we stand,
Yourselves and I, on NoMAN's land:
If truth the partridge has averr'd,
Then each of us is NoMAN's bird.
But I’ve an owner, there's no doubt,
For he could come and pick me out ;
If JENRINsoN or Jones should try,
You could they thus identify 2
If not, I hold you both are wrong,
And unto NoMAN must belong.
Where'er you are, it certain is
NoMAN can say that you are his.
Free denizens of fields and woods,
Who takes you steals but NoMAN's goods,
To NoMAN's injury alone,
Depriving NoMAN of his own.”

MORE GRAND PROCESSIONS.
THE streets of the metropolis have been enlivened during the week
by several grand processions which passed through them, consisting
of a herd of oxen and a triple troupe of anything-but-well-trained bulls,
engaged by MR. GIBLETTs of Bond Street, the celebrated tamer of
wild beasts, to take part in his wonderful exhibition, which is thrown
open to the public, in his shop window, free of charge, every Friday and
Saturday morning. '
The troupe started, at 12 o'clock in the day, from Smithfield, and pro-
ceeded down Fleet Street, the Strand, through Piccadilly, and up Bond
Street to MR. GIBLETTs’ establishment at the corner of Brook Street,
where every preparation had been made to receive it. The procession
was escorted by the distinguished drovers B and Q, and followed by an
unlimited number of little boys, who joined in the sport with a deal of
spirit. Driver DUGGINs also took a prominent part; he was seated in
his beautiful bright blue butcher's cart, the interior of which was
fitted up on this occasion with a select number of calves. The masterly
manner in which he succeeded in occupying the entire road, cutting
fearlessly from one side of the street to the other, in a style of horse-
manship worthy of the “Courrier of St. Petersburgh,” elicited fre-
quent remarks from the coachmen and omnibus conductors, who
pulled up expressly to look at his daring performances. The sight
altogether was very exciting, and many of the foot passengers appeared
much “struck” by the splendid animals, who were not at all dismayed
by the novelty of the scene, but jumped over every difficulty that stood
in their way with a grace and ease peculiar to that agile artiste, the
bull.
The wild cries and dances, also, of the natives who guided them, made
every one stop ; and their evolutions outside SHARPus's china shop,
where Young Heifer (only three years old) attempted a flying leap, a
la Harlequin, through the window, caused an excitement in the Hay-
market that has not been exceeded in the memory of the oldest apple-
woman. Lowther Arcade was closed during the procession, otherwise
the animals would doubtless have attempted that dangerous Pass, and
have left not a cup or a saucer unturned. All business was suspended
during the course of the proceedings, and a whole holiday was observed
in honour of the occasion by the police. The performances have gºn
such satisfaction, that they will be repeated, under the patronage of the
Common Council, every Smithfield market day until further notice.
PUNCH ON THE EDUCATION SCHEME.
Having been requested to “pronounce” on the subject of the Govern-
ment Education Scheme, we beg leave to say that we have weighed the
pros and the cons. in those scales of Justice which we always carry about
with us. We have looked at the project itself, and at the character of
the opposition which it has encountered ; and when desired to say
whether we think the remedy proposed for the awful ignorance that
prevails is more reasonable than the hostility with which it is met, We
have only to observe to the public at large–
“Your Baines and antidote are both before you."
Austria and Jenny X-ind.
THE EMPERoR of Austria, it is said, has conferred on JENNY LIND
the title of Singer of the Imperial Chapel. Considering the length of
the Imperial ears, this is the best use the Emperor has made of them.

WONDERFUL ESCAPE FROM THE TREADMILL-
...ONE of those farcical entertainments which have been played three
or four times lately every season in the neighbourhood of St. James's
Street, came off last week. Marlborough Street Police Office pre-
sented quite a gay and dashing appearance.
The vulgar “night charges” were supplanted by some score
gentlemen “of fashionable exterior,” the haul of a police inspector,
made the night before at a Hell in Bennett Street. Of course there
was no proof against them. There never is. They were discharged.
They always are. We cannot conceive why or wherefore police
commissioners issue orders, and police inspectors make descents upon
such houses. The law used to say, “You must catch people playing.”
This of course was very much as if it had said to the constable, “You
must catch the thief stealing.” This mockery is now felt to be too
barefaced.
Gambling, within the last ten years, has become less fashionable.
Lords and Commons are no longer quite so tolerant towards the
hazard-table. So the law has been altered, and now runs, “You must
find gambling instruments.” But it is only putting up an iron door
or two, strong enough to defy an inspector and a sledge-hammer, and
providing a convenient hiding-place for roulette-boards, rakes, dice-box,
and counters, and the hell-frequenters and hell-keepers, the demons
and their victims, may laugh at the law as safely as ever.
It is very curious, this law never wants proof to convict forger, or
thief, or burglar; but gamblers somehow slip through its iron fingers
| like eels. Certainly awkward effects might now and then follow if its
| grasp were a little more tenacious. It would be disagreeable to find in
the Times' police report, a list of the noble and distinguished company
| present at MR. HARDwick's matinée correctionelle at Malborough Street.
And the public feeling would be severely outraged by the occasional exhi-
bition of a noble lord taking out a summary “three weeks” at Brixton,
or of a distinguished popular leader on the wheel in Tothill Fields.
Otherwise there would be no great difficulty in the matter.
existence of such iron doors as guard these Hells, like Dante's—and
which might fitly bear the same inscription,
“All hope abandon, ye who enter here,”
—may be made an evidence against the house and those found in it.
The presumption would not be too violent.
Gentlemen do not usually barricade themselves within iron-plated
panels for purposes of innocent conviviality. We never remember
being asked to an inoffensive supper and sinless cigars, where we had
to run the gauntlet of three strong doors with a wicket in each, and a
gentleman of the Hebrew-Caucasian race taking a careful survey of our
person before admission. This fashion is peculiar to certain hospitable
first floors about St. James's ; and we cannot think their proprietors
would have any reason to complain if the rude hand of a Secretary of
State doomed them to the fate which has fallen on their suburban
| brethren at Ascot and Epsom.
NEWS OF THE COMING MAN.
THis important individual, who has been so long announced, and
who has so long disappointed the public, has been spoken with at
Jerusalem. When addressed, the only answer he gave was that of a
waiter—“Coming, coming, Sir.” He is expected in London very
shortly, and will take up his residence at MR. DisRAELI's in Duke
Street. Immense preparations are being made for him in a new 3 vol.
novel, which, it is rumoured, will about finish Tancred. Holywell
Street will illuminate on the night of the arrival of the Coming Man.
PROTECTION FOR SERVANT MAIDS,
WE beg to call attention to the mischief arising from allowing the
British soldier to go about in his red coat. The police reports inform
us of the conviction, at the Middlesex Sessions, of one DAVID RATCLIFFE,
a grenadier, for purloining the purse of a servant girl, at a concert to
which they had gone in company. MR. SERJEANT ADAMs, in his
charge to the jury, said that—
“It was extraordinary to what an extent domestic servants suffered themselves to be
duped by soldiers. They were foolish enough to be charmed, as it were, by the tall and
portly figure of a fine young fellow encased in a scarlet jacket, to such an extent that they
actually placed their reputation at stake for the mere pleasure of walking arm-in-arm
with him. He (the judge) was sorry to see girls were such fools, but he supposed it was
an infatuation they could not avoid.”
The wise precaution which disarmed the soldier, whilst off duty, of
his bayonet, has prevented him from the commission of much man-
slaughter; but it does not hinder him from committing woman-slaughter
to an extent which is truly frightful. He no longer gratuitously runs
people through the body, but he inflicts the most wanton injuries on the
female heart. It is absolutely necessary that he should be deprived of
the dangerous weapons which enable him to commit these outrages.
He really must not be suffered to be at large in his uniform. He must
doff the scarlet whilst he walks the streets, and exchange the military
cap for the plain oil-skin or gossamer. We now begin to see that
PRINCE ALBERT had some reason for inventing his celebrated hat. In
that, perhaps, there is small danger. But let the soldier be divested of
his red coat when he mingles with his fellow-citizens. In the mean-
while, with what security or confidence can we intrust our nursing-
maid with our children, or our cook with our leg of mutton 2
THE NATIONAL THEATRES.
AT the General Theatrical Fund Dinner, MR. MACREADY, in his
capacity of chairman, is reported by the Daily News to have said—
“That the present was a theatrical assembly, and he would propose to them as a toast,
those great national theatres which had the civilised world for their audiences, which
contained many excellent actors, and what was far more, many great and good men, -
he meant the two Houses of Parliament.”
MR. MACREADY has given utterance to a notion we have long
entertained, that
“Parliament's a stage,
And honourable members merely players.”
The House of Commons, as at present constituted, forms a strong com-
pany of comedians; but since the time of BURRE, whose famous dagger
scene is still remembered, it has been rather deficient in tragic talent.

WAL, the fact is, I’ve jest to ax your pardon; but as I never thought
of writin about these critters till I'd been a long time among em—
like a stupid 'possum as I was–BARNUM made up his mind to go back
to the States at the very nick of my last letter. And what with
packin all the plate and jew’lry—there's five-and-twenty packages of
watches, pencil-cases, and diamond and ruby rings, if there's an ounce
—what with makin all smoothe and strait, I’ve had no time to take up
my pen till now, when I sits down agin with the sweat upon my brow,
to catch up the thread where afore I dropt it. You recollect, in coorse,
the Dook of WELLINGTON was knockin to come in—but they kept
him at the door, while I was a dressin, out o' compliment like, for
NApoleon. Bein quite the emperor, I walks out, and motions for 'em
to open the door.
Wal, the Dook comes in. I heerd him, for I heerd BARNUM a scrapin
before him ; but I wouldn't look up; acause I'd got my arms a folded,
and was standin with my eyes down on the green baize of the table, a
contemplatin the battle of Oysterlitz. Then the Dook—with a lady
on his arm, or his arm on a lady's, I wont swear which—come close to
the table; and I heerd him take out his spy-glass, for it clicked like,
as he shook it to put it over his nose. Wal, he stood a starin at me
—and I heerd him grunt a leetle laugh. On which, lookin up, I
handed him my snuff-box. The critter dabbed in the tip of his leetle
finger, and agin grunted another leetle laugh. Wal, I felt my dander
rise, and looked piercin. You should have seen the Dook. There was
sich a whiteness came over his face; and his hair jest the leetlest
morsel in life did lift his hat off his head ; and then—as BARNUM told
me arterwards—I could see what was a movin inside of him. I
brought into his mind all the three days of Waterloo at once I could
see it—as BARNUM told me—I could see that he seed in me whole
squares of infants and battlelions of horses. He fit all the battle over

it him, at last the Dook slappin his leg screeched out—“Up guards !
and at em 1" And then the Dook could say no more; but bust into
tears, and was led by the lady out into the open air.
Wal, as for Dooks and Markesses, and critters o' that grit, there
was so many come to see me, I got tarnation tired of 'em. Very
sweet and flatterin at first, but 'twas like livin on molasses in the
eend. However—'rcept the Dook of IRon, as he 's called—they all
left with me their cards, in the shape of goold watches, and breast-
pins, and chains, and sich like ; and so, I can't speak o' the critters as
perhaps I ought, More's the pity : but as BARNUM ses, “If you want
to gag Truth, you must put a gold pin in her mouth.” Wal, I've as
many pins as a porkipine.
Arter a time, when the bloom was a bein wiped off the plum—as
BARNUM called it—that is, when the 'ristocracy begun to look upon me
as if I was not a bit better than theirselves—BARNUM said I should
go upon the stage. Father and mother lifted up all their hands and
feet agin the notion, and with tears in their eyes, said they would’nt
have their child disgraced no how. Whereupon BARNUM–oh, what
a critter it is 1 he'd talk an oyster out of its pearls—BARNUM ses,
“Disgrace l’ ses he, “why, the British stage is the glory of the
'varsal airth, and the glory of Britain in partiklar. Don't the QUEEN
go to the theatre three times a week, with all her Court in ostrich
feathers ? Three times a week,”—ses BARNUM, but he never said
'twas the 'Talian, not the British playhouse. Wal, father and mother
was honied all over by BARNUM, and it was agreed—though
mother said it 'ud shorten her life—that I should turn play-actor.
When this was known, you may be sure our house was beset by
managers. For a whole week we were obleged to have two policemen
to keep ’em off. At last, BARNUM made his pick of 'em ; and afore I
knowed where I was, I was upon the stage. But upon that pint, you

Poor PROFEssoR KELLER, the original importer of the Poses Plastiques,
has been run after not so much by the public as by a sheriff's officer,
who hunted the representative of the statues of antiquity in the most de-
termined manner. The Professor has consequently been compelled to add
some perfectly new groups to his stock, and among others, that of the
Bailiff Surprised has been exceedingly popular. It seems that KELLER,
upon two occasions, got up a Pose, which was a regular Poser to the
sheriff's officers, by presenting to them a facsimile of himself, whom he
allowed them to arrest by mistake, and then favoured them with a sort
of dissolving view, in the course of which the Professor suddenly turned
into one of his own pupils.
Perhaps the nearest approach to the heroism of antiquity that the
on the altar of liberty. As he was known by his beard, he boldly shaved
it off; and it is expected that “KELLER offering up his beard on the
shrine of freedom” will be one of the most attractive tableaux in his
next exhibition.

R THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DRURY LANE FUND DINNER.
“ON Friday, the 23rd of April,” says our friend the Observer, “‘the
annual feast” for the Drury Lane Theatrical Fund takes place.” We
have been favoured with a copy of the speech to be delivered by MR.
HARLEY, the efficient and eloquent master. It is as follows:–
“May it please your Royal Highness, and Gentlemen-It is again my
pleasurable duty to play upon your heartstrings, to arrive at your
pockets; and I trust I may without vanity observe, that, like a fiddler,
the longer I play the more delicate I consider the fingering.
“The Drury Lane Fund was established by that great creature and
bigamist, DAvid GARRICK. When I say bigamist, I mean that he had
two wives, Tragedy and Comedy (laughter), and, what was more
extraordinary, was equally master of them both. Their portraits were
painted by another great creature—need I add the name of SIR Joshua
REYNoLDs, Knight?
“DAvHD GARRICK projected our fund for the relief of the poor
player. It was established under the patronage of of one of the
GEORGEs, ancestor of the illustrious Prince, our president. For,
perhaps, even in this presence, it may be permitted me to say that the
brightest leaf in the umbrageous garland of the GUELPHs is their love
of the drama A leaf may I not say a hundred leaves?—witness
her Majesty's annual subscription—and every leaf a one pound Bank of
England note 1 (Cheers.)
“At the risk of being tedious, (Ories of ‘No,'), allow me, for the forty-
seventh time, to deliver my yearly lecture on the affecting uses of the
Drury Lane Fund. In the morning of life the young actor quits, it
may be, the paternal residence, to tread the thorny path that leads to
fame ; but hope is strong, and he feels not the hindrances that fester in
his way. Even as the traveller, with nocturnal shades closing round
him, is cheered by the twinkling of the distant taper, so is the young
actor supported by the far-off brightness of a London audience. His
hope, his aim, is the thought of Drury Lane, and Drury's most bene-
ficent and philanthropic fund. Alas! (may it please your Royal High-
ness, and Ladies and Gentlemen) alas! what is the reward of the genius
of the actor 2 Oblivion, (sensation); yes, oblivion! The sculptor
lives in stone ; the painter, stretching his canvas to the gale, floats
down to posterity ; the musician enshrines the bubble reputation in
nightingale notes, and the fame of a MozART may be said never to
know a minim rest. (Laughter.) With the actor it is pathetically
otherwise !
“Even as the rouge that lights the actor's cheek is swept by his own
‘defacing fingers’ ere he hies him to his humble but contented pallet,
so is the recollection of the actor's genius wiped from the memory of
the world. It is the luck of a SHARSPEARE to live for ever; whilst a
GARRICK is relentlessly doomed to be the creature of, so to speak, one
generation 1 (Applause.)
“I will not dwell upon the gratitude of those who are at the present
moment the thankful recipients of the bounty of the fund ; but, with
your permission, I will be awhile discursive on the number and con-
dition of those whose old age, it is not improbable, may be solaced by
what you will graciously subscribe this day.
“It has been tauntingly said of us that there are no actors at Drury
Lane; that this our annual appeal is, if I may be allowed to use the
word in such an august presence, is—a humbug l—(“Very right—very
proper,' from the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE). Thus encouraged, I fearlessly
repeat the word—humbug . It has been said that as Drury Lane em-
ploys no actors, and is not likely to employ any, the fund will ulti-
mately be scrambled for by a fortunate few To be sure, it has been
most indecorously suggested that it should merge in the General
Theatrical Fund, instituted for the illegitimate actors of illegitimate
pieces at illegitimate minor theatres. (Cries of “Shame !')
“No actors at Drury Lane ! But the press—the all-powerful press—
rebuts and utterly falsifies the venal accusation. I have only to remind
this distinguished audience of our new mammoth company; I have
only to appeal to the recollection of an enlightened public, so recently
delighted by the public entry of the ‘troupe’ into London—a poet, a
manager, and gentleman, whom a sense of delicacy permits me not
further to particularise, being prevented by Swedish business from
taking his rightful place upon the elephant's back.
“No actors Have we not, I ask it, two elephants, male and female 7
Have we not our JENNY LIND 2 And when the he-elephant—our
greatest living actor, I may be allowed to call him—shall have worn
himself out in the service of an enlightened public, will he not, as an
dawns he will not ask in vain for his bunch of carrots, and, haply, his
oranges on feast-days and Sundays 2 And then our own JENNY"LIND
-for since the poet BUNN could not have the Beauty herself, he was
determined to have the Beast—when her youth is past, will she not,
from the bounty of the fund, have her daily mouthful of clover, with,
haply, her pound of soft sugar moistened, like the sugar of Mrs. Gamp,
with the leetlest drop of gin 2 (Much Laughter.)
“When the camels, those quadruped Dukes of Gloucester, have ceased
to draw, will they not have, from your liberality, the pensionary truss
of hay–and the horses, will not they too enjoy their cosey paddocks,
their warm stables, and their daily feed of Fund beans and oats? Can
it be forgotten what the stage owes to horses 7 For what, I ask, would
Thespis have done without his four-in-hand to draw his cart withal P
(Laughter.)
“I am reminded that this is the birth-day of that great creature the
Swan of Avon ; need I say, SHAKspeARE * Let his large humanity fill
and elevate you ! Let him, who could feel for ‘the poor beetle, touch
your sympathies in the right place—need I observe, your pockets—for
the elephants Let him, who could sing about ‘the small gilded fly,’
strike at your hearts in the cause of the camels And, in conclusion,
let him who could paint ‘ the armed rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger,'
be permitted to succeed when he pleads to your inmost souls the cause
| of English piebalds and Burmese ponies.”

THE MILLION.
DECORATIONS (LITERALLY) For
WE see that there has been in the Chamber of Deputies the demand
for an additional grant of 50,000 francs for the Legion of Honour. This
further supply must be to provide for the increase of the population
during the past six months, for it is nonsense to suppose there was a
single person undecorated in France this time last year. The Statistical
Society would have given any money for the proof of such an extra-
ordinary fact. The cross is such a certainty now in France, that the
best physicians in Paris are in the habit of including it amongst
the diseases incident to humanity. They maintain, that, like the small-
pox, every one is liable to be attacked with it at some period or other of
his life. They deplore, in eloquent terms, that science has discovered
as yet no cure for the Legion of Honour; but they recommend every
Frenchman who is seized with it, to take it as kindly as possible, and
brave the consequences of his becoming a “marked” man.
* We wonder there is no opposition in the Chamber to these annual
grants for decorations ; for we believe that in real truth there is
nothing which goes more against a Frenchman's bosom than the
Cross of the Legion of Honour. In England we have now and then a
shower of frogs; in India they are subjected about once a year to a
shower of locusts; other countries are astonished occasionally with
a shower of stones; but in France a shower of crosses is so frequent,
that it has long ceased to be a phenomenon. We suppose it is something
in the climate, for we believe that an Englishman has only to stop a
month at Boulogne, and he is sure to be decorated.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
ST. PAUL's
* It was the general remark of the newspapers on Easter Tuesday, in
noticing the public exhibitions of the preceding day, that St. Paul's
and Westminster Abbey were not by any means so well attended as the
majority of the shows that were cpen for the gratification of visitors.
It seems to us quite clear that the Deans and Chapters of these two
edifices do not understand the art of putting forward the features
of their respective exhibitions in the most attractive light, and until
JULLIEN or some other great advertising genius takes the matter
in hand, “a beggarly account of empty” aisles must be looked for
instead of those crowded and overſlowing ones which might other-
wise be secured to the ecclesiastical showmen. Upon the principle that
everything ought to be done well if it is done at all, we beg to recom-
mend to the very reverend managers of St. Paul's and Westminster
Abbey a method of placing those great national shows well before the
public, by adopting the means which are now fashionable among show-
men of every class and character.
The mammoth procession of the other day might surely furnish a hint
to the clerical speculators, who would do well perhaps to retain MR.
BUNN in the capacity of acting manager. A string of board-men
carrying placards calling attention to some particular feature of the
show would, we are sure, prove very effective as an advertisement. A
placard inscribed “Do, papa, table me to see St. Paul's" would tell
º
EXHIBITION.
admirably at a time when the little boys are all home for the holidays.
Considering, too, that there has been a reduction of prices within the
last two or three years, it is a pity that more has not been made of such
an opportunity. The “great clock reduced to sixpence” would have
an immense effect in the shape of one of those broadsides which puffers
are continually firing for the purpose of taking the public by storm ;
and “London by Day”—from the top of the real St. Paul's—would
assuredly be as popular a catch-line as “London by Night,” which
attracts so many to the imitation St. Paul's at the Colosseum.
If Deans and Chapters will speculate in public exhibition it would
be as well to adopt proper management at once, so that there should
be as full a development as possible of the lucrative resources of the
two great cathedral establishments in the metropolis.
We have, however, a higher interest in desiring the Deans and
Chapters to adopt our views, for we are desirous that everything
should be done to place the matter of these exhibitions in a true
light, with a view to their nature and intention being fully under-
stood by the public. When this is done, the disgraceful system.
| will be so much the nearer its downfall; for it is hardly to be expected
that there will be much longer toleration for so gross an abuse, when
| j are thoroughly enlightened as to its truly low and sordid
| Character.

STATE OF THE SLAVE-MARKET.
Now that the SULTAN has abolished the slave-market in Turkey, it
is wonderful that such a thing should exist in England. The fact,
however, is so. Our slaves are the slaves of circumstances ; that is to
say, of bad circumstances, which oblige them to sell themselves for
governesses and tutors. The slave-market is brisk, but quotations are
made at very low figures. Its general state may be judged of by the
following advertisements, which we copy from authentic sources :-
W ANTED, a YOUNG LADY, about 20, who understands children, to take
the entire charge of two little girls (the eldest 11 years), and assist in needle-
work. Added to a good English education, she will be required to teach French and
music. She will have to live a few miles out of town, and if of good religious principles
and amiable disposition, will meet with every attention and consideration, but salary
will not exceed £15 and a laundress. The daughter of a clergyman, who has been
accustomed to instruction in her own family, would be preferred. Apply by letter,
stating every particular, to —.
LADY TEACHER WANTED IMMEDIATELY, for the Parish of
Avondale, and town of Strathaven. She must be qualified to teach the usual
branches required for a useful Female Education, such as English, writing, arithmetic,
needlework, knittipg, and music, &c., &c. There is an excellent Schoolroom and
Dwelling House free, but no Salary.
It thus appears that the live stock, though in some demand, is at a
discount. For understanding children, assisting in needlework, teaching
English, French, and music, £15 and a laundress are anything but a
premium. Religious principles are depreciated, and amiable disposi-
tions flat. Clergymen's daughters, however, are in some request. The
usual branches of a useful female education are a mere drug, and it will
be seen from the second of the above advertisements that sales in this.
line are sought to be effected by mere barter. The rate of exchange is
sadly below par.
In the male slave-market teachers are done at from £20, as will be
proved by the annexed quotation :-
EACHER WANTED for the FREE CHURCH Congregational School,
Newton-upon-Ayr. He must be qualified to teach according to the most
approved methods, English reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, book-
keeping, geography, mathematics, Latin, and Greek. An acquaintance with naviga-
tion, music, and drawing, will be an additional recommendation. The Schoolhouse
(which is not yet opened) is capable of containing upwards of 200 children. As it is
conveniently situated in the midst of a populous town, and connected with a numerous
congregation, an efficient Teacher may confidently expect that the School will be
largely attended. In addition to the Fees, and a Free Schoolroom, the Teacher will
receive a salary of £20, £30, or £45, according to his ability, and in conformity with
the regulations of the Education Committee of the General Assembly of the Free
Church. Applications, with Testimonials, to be addressed, &c.
Ayr, 25th March, 1847.
The foregoing prices show that Voluntary Bonds are heavy, and
indicate Government Educational Securities as a preferable investment.
It is manifest that reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar,
book-keeping, geography, and mathematics are dull; and that Latin
and Greek are by no means looking up. We wish we could see a better
feeling prevailing in the slave-market.

THE Patentee has much pleasure in presenting to the notice of the Public a new and
delicious perfume, called
Eau de Smithfield,
which is produced by a double distillation of all the essences peculiar to the well-known
salubrity of that favoured locality. The patentee has prepared several varieties of this
exquisite scent, including a delicious
Extrait-des-Moutons,
which is warranted to impart a soft and woolly odour wherever it may be applied, and will be
found invaluable for its fine aromatic qualities. There may also be had a most exquisite
preparation called the
Parfurn des Mille Porcs,
which is particularly recommended in cases of nervous headache, or as a demulcent in case of
rigidity of the facial muscles. The same proprietor is likewise preparing a new article for the
skin, to be called the
Ralydor des Boeufs. Insenses,
which it is expected will have the effect of whitening the complexion and producing an
interesting fairness of skin, which will be quite unapproachable by means of any other cosmetic.
JENNY LIND AT THE DRURY LANE FUND-DINNER.
At the time we publish, this solemnity has yet to be acted; but we have every reason to under-
stand that it will come off with unusual interest and splendour. We were last week enabled to
give a true copy of MR. HARLEY's mendicity speech for the quadrupeds forming the principal part
of Drury Lane Company. We are now in a position to speak of a still greater attraction.
if possible, for the feeders at Freemasons' Hall. A paragraph has been very industriously
circulated by the Fund Committee, assuring the public of a promise mysteriously made by the
Duke of CAMBRIDGE, to bring with him to the repast a distinguished foreigner recently arrived
in this country. People who professed to know something of the labyrinthine ways of high life,
declared that the foreigner could be no other than the Turkish Ambassador, commanded to
attend by the Sultan : for as MoLIERE has been acted before the ladies of the Harem, the Sultan is
no doubt stage-struck. Nevertheless, he is not yet become so low as to patronise the English
drama, our Ambassador at Constantinople having been instructed by the highest personage of
this realm to warn his Sublimity against so vulgar a prejudice. No ; the distinguished foreigner
promised by the Duke is not a biped exotic, but a stranger upon four legs; in fact, it is no
other than skittish JENNY LIND, the lady Elephant of Drury Lane :

going round with the hat
graceful bow at every donation.
The Committee proposed that his Royal Highness's carriage should be drawn by the illustrious
foreigner herself, from Cambridge House to the Freemasons'; but, we regret to state that, shrinking
from the celebrity attendant on such a design, the Duke has delicately objected. Therefore, the
Elephant will be introduced into the body of the Hall by MR. HARLEY, immediately after Non
nobis; and will proceed, as a member of the Drury Lane Company, to display her astounding
sagacity. We are enabled to give the details.
MR. HARLEY, having made his speech, will desire the elephantine JENNY to leave the room,
and return with his hat—informing the beast the maker's name and address, that she may pick it
The Eleºhant returns with the comic hat of the great comedian,
MR. HARLEY then makes a circuit of the tables, the Elephant following him, and—in fact—

We ought, by the way, to have premised that the Duke of CAM-
BRIDGE, with that'sly humour peculiar to himself—just to test the sagacity of the Elephant—winks
confidentially to those about him, and
then drops his subscription into the hat
in the shape of a bad half-crown.
Whereupon, the Elephant will lay down
the hat, take out the pocket-piece, and
ringing it on the mahogany with all
the emphasis of an old shopkeeper,
shake her head, and return the coun-
terfeit to the royal hand. (Great
laughter, in which his Royal Highness
joins)
The subscriptions being made, MR.
HARLEY will endeavour to open a con-
versation with the Elephant, after the
manner and wholly in the spirit of good
St. BARTHolomew.
Mr Harley. Now, JENNY LIND : don't
you think, JENNY, that you are very
much obliged to the company ?
Jenny screams, as much as to say
*Yes.”
Mr. Harley. That’s a pretty dear !
Well, I thought so. And wouldn't you
like to drink a toast, JENNY : Eh 7
Jenny yells in the affirmative,
Mr. Harley. To be sure. I knew that.
Well, here's a dollar; let's see how
you'll lay it out to enjoy yourself, my
pretty dear.
Jenny approaches a bell-pull, and tugs
it violently. A waiter with napkin
immediately walks up to the Elephant.
Mr. Harley. Now, JENNY, the waiter's
in the room—give your orders.
Here JENNY grunts and screams, and
waggles her trunk, and lifts her fore-feet
up and down, apparently in a state of
pleasurable excitement, immediately in-
terpreted as follows by MR, HARLEY.
Mr. Harley. That means, waiter, that
JENNY desires to have a bottle of rum—
your oldest Jamaica. Isn't that it,
JENNY 2
A terrific yell of delight from JENNY :
The glasses tremble on the board; but
the illustrious President, with character-
istic self-possession, merely observes—
“Oldest Jamaical Very proper.”
The bottle of rum is brought ; the
cork half-drawn. MR. HARLEY presents
the bottle to JENNY, who, pulling out the
cork, is about to drink. She is thus re-
buked by MR, HARLEY.
Mr. Harley. Is that your manners,
JENNY 2 Where's your toast 7 Remem-
ber, if you please, that—being one of the
principal actresses of Drury Lane—what
the gentlemen have kindly subscribed
to-night will be laid out upon the clover
and sugar, and almond-cakes and pound-
cakes of your old age. Therefore, JENNY,
you'll give a toast, will you?
Jenny screams.
Mr. Harley. I knew you would—with
appropriate action. Now, then, here's
the rum.
The Elephant takes the bottle, and
slightly bends her knees, bowing her head
in turn to all the tables. She then gives
a succession of screams, and with won-
derful sagacity—in fact, as the Duke
observes, “like any Christian,”—pours
the rum down her throat.
Mr. Harley. Your Royal Highness—
Ladies and Gentlemen—it is now my
duty to interpret the meaning of JENNY
LIND, our greatest actress, expressed in
her toast; a meaning in which the Com-
mittee fully join; it is this—“Success to
Drury Lane Fund !” which, as likely to
be administered as Drury Lane is at pre-
sent organised, is briefly, “Success to
Humbug." |

entitled “An Act for turning the Penal Laws against Popery to some
Account.” The means to be adopted for this purpose, we recommend,
shall consist in having the statutes in question painted on large boards
to be stationed in those places where Catholicism is most rife, in the
manner of notices or cautions to trespassers. The board might be affixed
to a post, or, what would come to the same thing, be placed in the
hands of SIR RoBERT INGL1s himself, in effigy. The figure of SIR

CODLINGSBY.
By B. DE SHREwsBURY, ESQ.
“THE whole world is bound by one chain. In every city in the globe
there is one quarter that certain travellers know and recognise from
its likeness to its brother district in all other places where are congre-
gated the habitations of men. In Tehran, or Pekin, or Stamboul, or
New York, or Timbuctoo, or London, there is a certain district where
a certain man is not a stranger. Where the idols are fed with
incense by the streams of Ching-wang-foo; where the minarets soar
sparkling above the cypresses, their reflexions quivering in the lucid
waters of the Golden Horn ; where the yellow Tiber flows under
broken bridges and over imperial glories; where the huts are squatted
by the Niger, under the palm-trees ; where the Northern Babel lies,
with its warehouses, and its bridges, its graceful factory-chimneys, and
its clumsy fanes—hidden in fog and smoke by the dirtiest river in the
world—in all the cities of mankind there is One Home whither men
of one family may resort. Over the entire world spreads a vast
brotherhood, suffering, silent, scattered, sympathising, waiting—an
immense Free-Masonry. Once this world-spread band was an Arabian
clan—a little nation alone and outlying amongst the mighty monar-
chies of ancient time, the Megatheria of history. The sails of their
rare ships might be seen in the Egyptian waters ; the camels of their |
caravans might thread the sands of Baalbec, or wind through the date- |

flame, and death, and struggle, Jerusalem agonised and died. * * *
Yes, the Jewish city is lost to Jewish men; but have they not taken
the world in exchange 7”
Mused thus GoDFREY DE Bouillon, MARQUIs of Codlingsby, as
he debouched from Wych Street into the Strand. He had been to
take a box for ARMIDA at MADAME WestRis's theatre. That little
ARMIDA was folle of MADAME WESTRIs's theatre ; and her little
Brougham, and her little self, and her enormous eyes, and her prodi-
gious opera-glass, and her miraculous bouquet, which cost LoRD Cod-
LINGsBY twenty guineas every evening at NATHAN's in Covent
Garden, (the children of the gardeners of Sharon have still no rival
for flowers,) might be seen three nights in the week at least, in
the narrow, charming, comfortable little theatre. GoDFREY had the
box. He was strolling, listlessly, eastward; and the above thoughts
passed through the young noble's mind as he came in sight of
Holywell Street. |
The occupants of the London Ghetto sat at their porches basking
in the evening sunshine. Children were playing on the steps. Fathers,
were smoking at the lintel. Smiling faces looked out from the various
and darkling draperies with which the warehouses were hung. Ringlets
glossy, and curly, and jetty—eyes black as night—midsummer night
—when it lightens ; haughty noses bending like beaks of eagles—eager
quivering nostrils—lips curved like the bow of Love—every man or
l
maiden, every babe or matron in that English Jewry bore in his
countenance one or more of these characteristics of his peerless
Arab-race.
“How beautiful they are l’ mused Codlingsby, as he surveyed
these placid groups calmly taking their pleasure in the sunset.

“D'you want to look at a nishe coat 7” a voice said, which made

“The same, LoRD CodlingsBY,” the individual so apostrophised

RAFAEL laid his hand on his breast, and bowed, an Oriental reverence.

disguise. He shields himself in craft, since the Norman boors perse-
cuted him.
They passed under an awning of old clothes, tawdry fripperies,
greasy spangles, and battered masks, into a shop as black and hideous
as the entrance was foul. “This your home, RAFAEL 7" said LoRD
CodlingsBy.
“Why not ?” RAFAEL answered. “I am tired of Schloss Schin-
kenstein; the Rhine bores me after a while. It is too hot for Florence;

WHAT IS ETHIOPIA P
THE tremendous influx of Ethiopians which has
occurred within the last year in this country,
has rendered it desirable that we should know
something of the country to which we are
indebted for these sable visitors. STRABO
places the Ethiopians near the Atlantic Sea ;
and we sometimes wish that STRABO had
placed them all at the bottom of it, and
thus have prevented them from becoming
- so great a nuisance as they have lately proved
- themselves.
The Ethiopians of antiquity raised a temple
to JUPITER AMMON, but the modern Ethi-
opians adopt MAMMON and GAMMON as their
idols. The origin of the Ethiopian race is
lost in obscurity, but it is evident that we
must look in the dark ages for the object of
our search; and it is equally certain that we
shall remain in the dark if we pursue our
investigations in the quarter alluded to. Our business is more with the
modern than the ancient Ethiopians, and with the geography of the country
of the former we are only too familiar.
Modern Ethiopia is bounded in the front by a row of stage-lamps, which
do duty for the equinoctial line, and separate the swarthy children of
the night from the rest of the community. As far as the eye can see
Ethiopia is bounded at the back by an extensive flat—made of canvass—and
the intervening landscape is filled up by gentlemen's seats in the form of
chairs of mahogany.

Ethiopian scenery.
The ground is thickly wooded—with planks—and rises by a gentle slope
towards the flat scenery in the rear.
The costume of the inhabitants of this curious
locality is by no means varied or picturesque,
but is supposed to be well adapted to the manners
and customs of this strange race of people. The
dress they wear is exceedingly plain, and exhibits
a desire to have everything in black and white,
which is carried to a wonderful extent ; but the
black appears to predominate. The natural
products of our dramatic Ethiopia are black
lead, bones, and banjos, with the first of which
articles the natives dye their hands and faces ;
but it is a singular circumstance that the dark-
ness of skin reaches no higher than the wrist,
~e-_T-
and goes no lower than the throat of this won-
derful human family. Their pursuits are chiefly
musical, and they extract melody from bones in
a most astounding manner.
It is a wonderful trait in the Ethiopian character, that the people renounce
costume of ethiopia.
already described, and become citizens of the every-day world
in a true cosmopolitan spirit, directly after they have left the
haunts and homes of their dramatic existence.
It is a distinguishing mark of the Ethiopians, which separates
them entirely from the blackamoor race, that whereas the latter
cannot be washed white, the former are easily susceptible of this
process.

course, with the spread of enlightenment.
GROSS INSULT TO MR. PUNCH.
SoME soulless, graceless, tasteless being has put the subjoined
advertisement into a morning journal :—

REIGN will be given for it and its contents.

such a paltry sum as one sovereign For a treasure which—

Let this unworthy owner of Punch's
Pocket Book know that half the world is scrambling for a sight of

favour than the cashing of any bill of exchange. Punch hereby
retorts the contempt which he has been treated with, and begs to
tell this individual, in the words of the Eton Grammar,
“Ego illum flocci pendo qui me pili aestimat:”
“I regard him at a rush who esteems me at a hair;”
a quotation which he has felt himself obliged to translate for
the benefit of a person so very illiterate as to see nothing in his
Pocket Book but a paltry bill.
Ioreadful Continental Failures.
It has been objected against the new House of Lords, that it
has too much of an “ecclesiastical” appearance ; and certainly
the seats have exactly the look of cathedral pews. This is borne
out by a remark SIBTHoRPE made when he went over the build-
ing. He was asked by MR. BARRY if he could see any room for
improvement? “Plenty of room,” he said “if, “non tanti piu,”
there were not so many pews.”
LoRD BRough AM made a similar observation. After comparing
the seats to “church sittings,” he exclaimed, “But the place took
so long building, that I suppose the seats were only put by de-
grees, or as we say in France, ‘pew a pew.’ (“Our London, Cor-
respondent” is welcome to either of these jokes for his provincial
papers.)
CAPPING THE HAT.
AN order will shortly be issued from the Horse Guards, out of
compliment to a noble Prince, who is in training for the Com-
mander-in-Chief, that for the future all the percussion caps for
the new muskets of the Army are to be modelled after the design
of the ALBERT Hat.
TAKING ORDERS.
A CLERGYMAN, who is just on the point of marrying a second
time, has made his intended promise, before she enters into. the
matrimonial state, that she will never exceed thirty-nine articles
their country and their colour the moment they quit the landscape we have of dress.

PENN PUNCH & THE SMITHFIELD SAVAGEs.
“O pardon me,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers.”—SHAREspeaRE.
N 1683, the great WILLIAM PENN–was there ever regal
purple to be compared with his Quaker drab 2–made a
treaty with the savages. The American historian has
chronicled the event, an American painter has put it upon
canvass. “We meet,” said PENN, “on the broad pathway
of good faith and good will ; no advantage shall be taken
on either side, but all shall be openness and love. I will
not call you children, for parents sometimes chide their
children too severely ; nor brother, only, for brothers differ.
The friendship between me and you I will not compare to
- a chain, for that the rains might rust or the falling tree

might break. We are the same as if one man's body were
to be divided into two parts: we are allone flesh and blood.” Such
were the words of WILLIAM PENN.
“And the children of the past,” says GEORGE BANCROFT, now
American Minister at the Court of Her Britannic Majesty, “were
touched by the sacred doctrines, and renounced their guile and their
revenge.”
Last week, Punch having endued his person in the humanizing drab
—having crowned his “dome of thought” with the true, ennobling
broadbrim—since it was never yet removed that a coronet might
take its place—Punch, in fact, dressing himself after the manner of
WILLIAM PENN, and taking with him John LEEch, his own historical
painter, Punch did last week visit Smithfield to have a conference
and make a treaty with the Smithfield Savages. “Look to the right
and you will behold the pictur !”
All Smithfield and its salubrious neighbourhood seemed humming
with the intelligence of the promised advent of Punch. Ere the sun,
with the heavy, inflamed eye of a drunkard, looked upon the shambles
of Whitechapel, Smithfield and its roundabout were wide awake l
And the sun rose and rose in slaughterous redness. And then Smith-
field savages, pouring in from every side, took their places on the
| classic, blood-dyed Field of Smith, awaiting Punch.

shoulders, glistened in the girdles, and dangled from the middle !
All the savages had their faces greased with more than ordinary
care for the occasion; and wore aprons stained with a peculiar blue
known to these people.
The clock of St. Sepulchre, as Punch arrived on the ground, struck
ten ; he was received with the loudest greeting.

CAPSIC UM HCUSE FOR YOUNG LADIES.
CHAPTER I.
A VISIT TO CAPSICUM House. MISS GRIFFIN ON THE FIRST
PRINCIPLES OF STUFFING.
throughout the land, attacking constitutions in no way able to with-
stand it, and making very grave folks very bad indeed ;-the serious
reader may now imperfectly understand our emotion as we approached
Capsicum House. It was a building worthy of its purpose. A large,
square, massive, red brick house; a house that somehow revealed the
solid comforts to be had within. A house, it was plain, with a magni-
ficent cellar for its heart—a cellar that at seasons sent its red blood
throughout the whole body of the building. The contemplative man,
his eye for the first time resting on the dining-room windows, would
inevitably subside into calculation; would count the number of elbows
that might be allowed honest play around the mahogany circle of that
room. There are many such houses throughout our merry land; and
yet how often are they in a fallen condition How often do we see
them put in irons by the mad doctor for private lunacy, how often
are they made the wineless sanctuaries for schoolmistresses : How
often is the use of the globes despotically taught in some noble room
—a room especially built that men might therein congregate and with
spirits on the wing—the bee's-wing—play with the globe, as school-
boys afore-named play at marbles l
The house was approached through an avenue of limes, curiously
cut. One bent to the wind, a large green shoulder of mutton—another
had a sirloin shape—whilst shrubs came up in frying-pans and fish-
slices; and cruet-stands grew in box ; and all things around had a
learned presence significant of the studies pursued by the rosy dwellers

GRIFFIN, turning the angle of a holly-hedge, came sharp upon us.
| She had a bunch of parsley in her hand, and wore a snow-white
apron high up, succinctly drawn across the bosom. Meeting her in
the garden, and with the parsley in her hand, we gallantly observed,
from some poet—
“Plucking the flowers, herself the fairest flower . "
“Why, the fact is, dear Sir”—said Miss GRIFFIN, blowing the dew
in silver drops from the parsley—“the fact is, I am just now a little
busy with some of the girls. The Weal-Stuffing Class is on, and there
is one girl, Miss FLUKE-whatever will become of her in the world, I
can't tell—I never can get her to understand the proper proportions
basis—of education.” We bowed. “A woman ignorant of stuffing,”
said Miss GRIFFIN solemnly, “is ill-calculated to meet the trials of this
life. You cannot tell how the giddiness of that girl distresses me.
However, I have my mission to perform, and stuffing is a part of it.
Nevertheless, Miss FLUKE is my great trouble. It has always been
my pride to turn my girls into the world with such unmistakeable
marks about them, such staring accomplishments, if I may be allowed
the phrase, that those who know my system, can at once exclaim—
“That's a GRIFFIN l' Now, I do not wish to prejudge anybody;

call a Churchman who, in public, should ridicule the religious views

Of course he does not mean to apply these epithets to DR. KockINs.
He will only say that he is a mistaken man; or rather, if the expression

despair; “I can hardly expect it, but I can only hope she'll not

* Tancred " at the Horne-Office.
THE Morning Post, one day last week, contained the following impor-
tant announcement :—
o: MR. TANCRED had an interview with SIR GEoRGE GREY yesterday at the Home-
ce.”
The object of TANCRED's visit to the Home Secretary has not trans-
pired, and we cannot well conjecture what it was. Had he gone
to the Foreign, instead of the Home Office, we might have guessed his
errand, which would probably have had reference to the “Asiatic
Mystery.”
THEATRICAL PORTRAITS.
THE Elephant is sitting for his portrait, which is to be prefixed to
the Desert, as soon as it is incorporated in CUMBERLAND’s British Theatre.
The Camels intend publishing their portraits separately, as they will
have the advantage of being “coloured;" their conceit—and they have
Education. But we do not think the end so very laudable as quite to
justify the means; namely, buffoonery in connexion with Baptism.
DR. Kockins's organ of “Veneration” is probably small; and perhaps
a blow from the cudgel of Mr. Punch may raise at least something like
a bump in the region of it.
LOOKS versus BOOKS.
It is said that the face is an index to the mind, but it surely cannot
be pretended that there is a table of contents in a discontented counte-
nance. We may sometimes read a man's character in his features, but
Time sometimes scratches and scrawls so many lines over the forehead
and cheeks, that the whole visage is quite illegible. For our own parts,
we are rather slow in deciphering these matters, and find very few
faces that will really repay perusal. We do not know of any that we
should always like to have upon our library table. We have been
able to observe in some a capital eye, but many that we have seen are
the merest blanks, in which scarcely anything is traceable.
LoRD BYRoN was disposed to read mankind as we would a clock, by
the hands; and certainly those who have any acquirement at their
fingers' ends may be judged of in this manner. Some physiognomists
have been generally led by the nose ; so that, what with one and the
other, it is difficult to decide what is the best criterion to go by.

The said PETER wox mightie proude, and be-
thinking him of PETER THE EREMITE, how he
preached the crusade, he devised how he also mighte

Now he had herde of Education, how people saide much goodethereof,

wot not whatte this Education mighte be; but he saide straighte, “Lo || \
you, peple seken this Education, I will go forthe with my brasse and
mythicke skulle and putte it downe.” Then saide divers of his friendes
to him, “Nay, PETER, lest thou braine thee against it, for it is a stout
thing and a hardy.” “Hal” quoth PETER,"brain meno braines; of them
reck I little; yea, I have of yore putte downe mine own.”
Then he preachedde how that Education was an Humbugge, and
how that the more waxed she the more waxed crime, and other grie-
vous and wilde talke he held to any such rabble as would heare.
And at thatte same time were otheres holding like discourse ;
specially one madde fellow called BAINEs made great mischiefe. And
when PETER preachedde his crusade, so there came forthe apestilent
route, cryinge “Downe with Bookes.” Manye blind were amonge
them, and marvellouse shallow wittes, and olde women eke who saide
how that this Education woulde make slaves of the peple. And
Ignorance thatte had slunke into bye-places for a while, came forthe
and kissed SIR PETER, and swore him for her championne and goode
knighte, and wente bravely aboute, and helde a highe court in the
Halle of Exetere, whither came divers of her olde foes, and sware
fealtie unto her, and made themselves her men. So Ignorance waxed
exceeding proude.
And as she was sette in the Halle of Exetere, came the saide PETER,
and avowed to be ye championne chosen of Ignorance against all
comers. And thereupon, when Ignorance was sette on the high dais,
with her Courte round her, and LoRD BAINEs as Chancellere, came in
PETER, in brasse, ridinge mightie proude on ane donkeye, with a cappe
on his head, and belles ringinge merrilie; and saide thus—
“Oyez Oyez I, PETER the Putter-down, goode knighte and true,
do here avouche Ignorance to be true and rightfulle Queene of this
reaume of Engleland, and wille abye the same on my hedde. And
whoso maintayneth aught agenst this avouchinge, I do proclaim him
false faitour, and will prove it on his bodye.”
And therewithe flung his gage upon the floore, and anon departed
ridinge for more courtesy and solace with his face unto the taile of the
asse, for thatte ye beaste woulde not otherwise voide the Halle. And
anon the Courte shouted acclaime unto PETER.
And so Ignorance helde herself mightie highe, and wened she had
been indeed Queene of Englelande, for that SIR PETER hadde putte
down Education. Natheless it was none so, as ye will see anon.
“we Met”—in Spain.
SPAIN is famous for her own ballads: but it is probable that at least
one of ours will become very popular in that country. We allude to
the pathetic song, “We Met,” which is understood to be a great
favourite of QUEEN IsabelLA's, who, with reference to the position
wherein she has been placed by CHRISTINA, is said to be constantly
singing the burden of the ditty—“Oh, thou hast been the cause of
this anguish, my mother!”
court T. CIRCULAR.
Owing to the paucity of folks at the last Drawing-room, it is
understood the next will only be a Parlour.
MANY of our readers will remember the vivid picture given by the
late MossIEUR Ducrow, of the Courier of St. Petersburgh, who was
represented as carrying the Moscow Mail on no less than five horses
at once, and alternately resting his right toe on the tip of the ear of
the one, while his left foot just reached the end of the tail of another,
and his arms embraced the necks of two more, leaving his chin
supported on the forehead of the remaining charger. In this uncom-
fortable attitude he was supposed to be travelling over the whole
route, to the tinkling of bells and the accompaniment of music ; while
Russia was represented by the ring of sawdust.
It appears that the Emperor has ordered the immediate construction
of a railway; and, as we presume the habits of the Russian Couriers
will remain unchanged, it will probably be necessary for them to have
a triple line of rails to permit the indulgence of that spirit of restless-
ness which animates the carriers of the mail from St. Petersburgh.
We can imagine the splendid act of engineship that Duckow would
have given us on such a suggestion as that which we have thrown out
in these observations. He would have flung himself about from boiler
to boiler with an abandon that no one but himself could achieve; and
we should have seen him at one moment poised upon a pair of funnels,
while at the next instant he would have been hanging on by the safety-

PARAGRAPHS FOR THE PROVINCES; OR, SCRAPS
FROM “our LONDON coRRESPONDENT."
Y-THE-BYE, the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT are
a great deal more in the habit of mixing with
the people than is generally suspected. It
happens to be known to the present writer, and
to nobody else, that on the first night of the
Desert at Drury Lane, the anxiety of the royal
pair to witness the performance took them
into the pit, which they entered with the rush
at the first opening. PRINCE ALBERT often goes
to the Haymarket at half-price, and your cor-
respondent has frequently had the honour of
sitting next to him, and getting into conver-
sation with his Royal Highness on the talents
of the company. The PRINCE is a warm admirer
of what are called “little bits” in the drama, and if he recognises, in
the delivery of a message, any particular emphasis or earnestness of
manner, he generally takes a note of the actor's name in a small
memorandum-book.”
“You will be surprised to hear that Punch has passed into the hands
of Lord BROUGHAM. The writers and artists are now on a visit at
Brougham Hall, where the noble host turns out a stag every day, to
gratify the well-known sporting propensities of the Punch corps of
celebrities. I told you long ago that PEEL always used to sit for his
portrait in all the caricatures in which he was introduced, and he never
went down to the House without sending to know whether he should
be wanted in Fleet Street. By the bye, I was wrong in telling you
that the publisher's “boy” had resigned, and that a general disorganis-
ation had been the consequence. My informant was the boy himself;
but as he has gone to settle on his own account in New Zealand, I can-
not call him as a witness to my veracity.”
“Everybody in town is talking of the new moon which appeared a
night or two ago in the sky, and is to remain with us for a month.
It is about the same size and brightness of many of its predecessors,
and I should not, perhaps, have thought it necessary to mention it, but
I know you rely upon your London Correspondent for a certain amount
of matter, and I may as well fill my sheet with one thing as with
another.”
“JENNY LIND has not yet arrived, but letters are in town from some-
body who saw her at Vienna. I have not seen these letters yet, but I
am promised by the postman a peep at the direction if any more of
them should come to town before the ‘Nightingale.' I must now conclude
my weekly budget, as I have promised Lord, John Russell, to dine
with him, and I can see him walking up and down before my lodging,
evidently impatient for my joining him.”

Emigration.
As emigration is being carried out on a very large scale in Ireland,
could not the SMITH O'BRIEN party be induced to leave their country?
We are not particular where they go to, providing it is as far away
from Ireland as possible. , Government might present them with some
snug little island at the Antipodes, where they might make speeches to
the natives as much as they pleased, and be allowed to legislate for
themselves. We are confident, if this scheme was properly carried out,
it would be the greatest boon to Ireland that has happened since the
day when ST. PATRick “drove out all the warmint.”
THE MAMMOTH ESTABLISHMENT AT DRURY LANE.
We have been favoured by a gentleman, who signs himself “Equestrian
Manager, Drury Lane Theatre,” with an order to view the carriages in
the Rose Inn, Farringdon Street, belonging to the Mammoth Establish-
ment. We regret that we have no time to attend the levee of the
PRINCE of Pensia, who will be found at home from twelve till three,
in his triumphal car, under an archway.
We understand that, animated by the recent example at Covent
Garden, there is an intention to rebuild Drury Lane, for the purpose of
constructing an arena, in which it will be attempted to give a more perfect
representation than has ever yet been attempted in this country of the
Equestrian Drama. The pit will be entirely taken away, and a circle
placed in its stead, while no expense will be spared to import several
waggon-loads of the very best saw-dust, in order to place the Eques-
trian Drama on a secure footing. The enterprising Lessee and his
indefatigable Stage Manager have long been studying the parts so

ment to the ring, of which it has hitherto been destitute.
It is in contemplation to adapt some of the most popular productions
of former seasons to the equestrian art, and the Bohemian Girl, on a
rapid courser, will be one of the earliest novelties. An engagement
will be offered to Moss. JULLIFN to compose an entirely new gallop,
which will be got up by a double stud of horses, and the HANsoM's
Patent Safety Quadrilles will be one of the earliest novelties.

JENNY LIND AT DRURY LANE.
MR. BUNN has certainly kept faith with the
public, by presenting the long-promised
JENNY LIND on his stage, though in the
shape of an elephant. She is undoubtedly the
greatest creature that ever trod the dramatic
boards, and stands higher than any other
member of the profession. Her compass is
extraordinary, for she can reach to the middle
of A Flat without any difficulty, and in a
slow movement her aplomb is truly wonder-
ful. We do not think she excels in rapid
passages, but her run, if she were to give
full vent to it, would, no doubt, make a powerful impression on her
audience.
CAPSICUM HOUSE FOR YOUNG LADIES.
CHAPTER II.
MISS GRIFFIN UPON THE,TEA-POT. “MORALS AND EXAMPLES.”
WASPS AND HUSBANDS.
Miss GRIFFIN was about to plant her foot upon the door-step : she
paused. “With your leave,” she said, “we’ll take a turn down the
Tea-Table Walk. A little more air will do me good; for that Miss
FLUKE does so distress me ! Well ! I suppose I must go through
with it ; but sometimes I fear I have hardly strength for my mission.”
Anxious as we were to enter Capsicum House—the Great Westibule,
as we considered it, to all the Domestic Virtues—nevertheless, we sup-
pressed the wish with the strong hand of gallantry, and, with Miss
GRIFFIN turning, turned about.
Three or four minutes, and we entered Tea-Table Walk. Here,
as in other parts of the garden, there were household lessons for the
female mind in the greenest and fullest leaf. In one bed was a most
charming tea-service, in the tenderest coloured and most delicate box :
whilst on either side were two huge bushes, trimmed and taught to
shoot as tea-kettles. They struck us with a blow of fine art. “How
noble !” we cried.
“What I the kettles 2 Yes, they are fine,” said Miss GRIFFIN, with
humble, chastised pride; “the kettles are natural, and when the bees
are buzzing about 'em you'd positively think they boiled.”
“And a complete tea-service l’” we cried; and admiration simmered
in our soul.
“Everything but the spoons,” remarked Miss GRIFFIN ; “but all
in good time. As I say to the girls, be patient ; patience is a virtue
—peculiarly a female virtue, for though it is greatly encouraged, it
meets with so little reward. Pardon me, my dear sir,” said Miss
GRIFFIN, laying the sprig of parsley very gently on our coat sleeve,
“but I feel that I can talk to you as to a sister.”
We made no reply to this ; but it was plain that Miss GRIFFIN saw
doubt rippling the corners of our mouth.
“Pray understand me,” she quickly followed. “I mean, I am so
impressed—have such a rock-like confidence in your sympathy with
women, in their great social struggle with their natural enemies—”
“Natural enemies 1" we exclaimed. “Impossible !”
“Oh ſ* cried Miss GRIFFIN, “it’s no use denying it—none at all,
now. For six thousand years—and I don't know how much longer,
according to Doctor BUCKLAND–all your sex have worn a mask, and
gone under a false name. But it is my mission to discover you. In
Capsicum House things are called by their proper titles. In this place
Man”—added Miss GRIFFIN, solemnly—“so long disguised, is taught
to be what he is, a natural enemy. And you know you are.”
There was an emphasis in this that enforced a polite confession.
We therefore bowed.
“To be sure,” cried Miss GRIFFIN, “I knew I might rely on
your frankness. Well, sir, I will be equally open. The whole aim
and tendency of the Griffinian system is to confound and conquer this
natural enemy; or, as I once happily observed to the girls in this
very walk, to turn the tea-tables upon man.”
“The happy thought,” we observed, “was no doubt suggested by
the genius of the place. Nothing can be more charming, more natural,
kerchiefs, and that little rebel Miss FLUKE seized a fire-screen.
“A large subject,” we observed; “a subject with many branches.”
º Not a tree in the garden has a greater number,” cried Miss GRIFFIN,
a little viyaciously. “I look upon the tea-pot, properly directed, as a
great engine in the hand of woman—an engine, sir, of subjugation of
her natural enemy.”
“Can it be possible 2 Is it really so *" we said, a little doubtingly.
“As I observed,” said Miss GRIFFIN, “I can—I am sure of it—
speak to you as to a sister. Such a large, and pure, and tender heart as
you possess is quite thrown away upon a man. I know all your good-
ness, my dear sir; and this I will say—you deserve to be nothing less
than one of us.”
At this we made the lowest of bows, all but touching the gravel-
walk with the tips of our fingers.
“And some afternoon, when I'm upon Tea, I trust I may be honoured
with your presence. If I am proud of anything, it is perhaps my Gun-
powder Class, sir. The classics—people who never knew what reai Pekoe
was talk of their magic herbs, and philtres, and love-charms. Now,

for-nothing goddess of 'em all. Let the young wife fascinate the
husband with the tea-pot—let her only bring him into habits of
intoxication with tea-let her, so to speak, make household honey-
suckles clamber up his chair-back and grow about the legs of his
table-let the hearth-rug be a bed of heart's-ease for feet in slippers,
—and the wickedness of the natural enemy must die within him, and,
as I say, his subjugation be complete.” Unconsciously, we shook our
head. “Don’t tell me,” said Miss GRIFFIN ; “kindness is the true
killer. I often illustrate the agreeable fact ; for in Capsicum House
no natural object is lost upon us. For instance, last Tuesday, whilst
the Milk Punch Class was on, an enormous wasp came like a Lillipu-
tian dragon into the room, and flew from girl to girl. Immediately,
they began to scream. I own it; this is the sad weakness that I have
to fight against , but, somehow, girls consider screams as property
they're born to. Some of the girls flew at the wasp with hand-
Feel-
ing that the time was come for me to show my energy, I exclaimed
with all my natural vigour, “Silence, ladies 1 silence, for a moral and
an example "—my usual mode of speech when about to submit any
natural object to a social, or, I should rather say, to a conjugal
illustration.
“‘A moral and an example !' cried the girls, and, except that FLUKE,
they were still as mice.
“‘Bring me the salad cruet,' was my command; and, with a thought,
the salad cruet stood upon the table. “Now, young ladies,” I observed,
taking a pen ; “now for the moral and example. You are here to
be finished for sensible, affectionate, but above all, controlling wives.
You are here to learn how best to subdue your natural enemies, that
is, to govern the men who may become your husbands. Yes, ladies,”
—for somehow (I can always tell) I felt the flow of words was coming,
and it was not for me as a woman to stop it—‘Yes, ladies, the Grif-
finian system will teach you how to control and overthrow your
tyrants. Man, marrying us, puts a gold ring upon our third finger,
and, in the arrogance of his heart, makes us, as he thinks, his blushing
captive. And shall not man, also, wear a ring—our ring 2 Yes; he
shall !' Here that Miss FLUKE proposed three cheers, but, with a
look and brow of thunder, I stopt her. ‘If,' said I, “we must wear
his ring upon our finger, let him—and not know it, poor wretch for
that’s the true triumph—let him wear our ring in his nose.” Here
Miss FLUKE jumped upon a chair and huzzaed, and—well, this time
I did not attempt to suppress the natural burst of delight so honour-
able to their feelings—all the other girls joined in the shout.
“‘A ring in his nose, I repeated ; “not the bit of shining gold
that declares our slavery, but an invisible, a fairy ring, that—like a
fish with a hook—he knows nothing about, only that he must follow
wherever it pulls him. Bless you, my dears l there's such rings in the
noses of thousands of husbands, though—for all they shave every
morning—they never see 'em.”
“‘And dearest madam,’ asked Miss PEBBLEs, a girl I have the
greatest hopes of “dearest madam, how is the nose of our natural
| enemy to be rung 2"
“‘Listen,' said I, ‘listen and attend, and you shall have a moral

OPENING OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
WELL, the House of Lords is open, and—if we would not have our
heart burst, we must “unpack it,” for never was carpet-bag fuller—
and we are disappointed. Be it understood that we are about to find
no fault with Mr. BARRY ; and Doctor REID, having been appointed
door-keeper to the Temple of the Winds, we shall let him also rest.
Neither shall we drop our bitterness upon the velvet and gilding, and,
like some of our contemporaries, take to pieces HER MAJESTY's state-
chair, and the chair of ALBERT, and the stool of the PRINCE of WALEs.
No ; our cause of discontent is larger, weightier, and must give utter-
ance in loudest volume. We are disappointed with the Peers them-
selves; for they have taken possession of their new abode, and have
failed to give a house-warming ! What luck can be expected from
their labours ? Such conduct towards the people of England, who
would not have minded paying a fair price for the treat, put in among
the other estimates, is downright shabby.
And such a pleasant evening might have been spent 1 IIad the
Lords given due notice of the intended hospitality, we feel convinced
that distinguished personages—rarely condescending to visit even
Courts—would have honoured the house-warming. Justice, who is
known to have her abode in the skies—coming to this world only upon
great occasions—would no doubt have come with golden scales, and—
(a hint, this, upon killing)—with her sword in the scabbard, would have
been one of the party. Though blind, anybody would have shown her
the way to the House of Lords; or, borrowing CERBERUs for the
occasion, the faithful dog would have led her there, taking her by the
way to the Courts of Law, which he so well knows; avoiding Chan-
cery, of course, as too much for her feelings. And it would have been
very pleasant to see Lord BRough AM doing the hospitality of the
treat, sitting himself beside her. This would have been delightful for
the people of England only once to look upon.
And TRUTH-not, of course, as she appeared in the antique world—
would have been of the party. Appearing in her ancient simplicity,
she would inevitably have caused great offence to many distinguished
noblemen, and would no doubt have been given in charge to the officers
of the House for a misdemeanor; therefore TRUTH would have at-
tended in a nice light evening dress, composed of that fine gauze that,
in these days of decency, legal milliners delight to clothe her with.
And MERCY, and all the Virtues, would have left their skiey home to
the softest and tenderest manner possible, just oiled it upon the
pass an evening with the Peers, and to give good augury to their house-
warming.
| We should not have been surprised to see MINERVA with the Bishop
of London, agreeably chatting, now on the Education Question, and
now on the Greek metres.
And MERCURY, the god of letters, might have taken the Bishop
of Norwich by the button, and, as a great favour, begged to know who
was “the somebody of Leeds,” so prettily flouted by the Right
Reverend Prelate. And the Bishop might have lifted his eyebrows,
and vowed he couldn't tell.
Eolus would of course have attended, with a free admission for
himself and party, signed by Doctor REID.
MARs, in undress uniform, would have begged the Iron Duke to
introduce him to the MARQUEss of LondosperRy, “having been so
much delighted” with his War in the Peninsula /
However, no further to enumerate, it is plain that the Peers of Eng-
land have missed a great opportunity. They might have had all the
Virtues, all the Noble Qualities to grace their house-warming, with the
people of England looking on, and then sitting down to sup. Dancing,
too, might have been kept up until a late hour in the morning. All
this might have been done—and what has been effected 7 Nothing.
It is, however, whispered that they intend to invite the kingdom to a
vocal concert performed by themselves, occasionally accompanied by
their own brass band.
BRITANNIA AND THE BLACKS.
“How the blacks fly!” may well be the exclamation of anyone who
now visits the metropolis, for the Ethiopian mania has brought down
upon London a shower of blacks, which, though destined to end in
smoke and be carried offinto thin air, must be considered just now avery
disagreeable nuisance. The raising of the wind will always bring down
the blacks rather unpleasantly, and they are now brought under our
noses, forced before our eyes, and driven into our ears, by the tremen-
dous puffs that circulate on all sides of us.

If any of those geniuses who undertake to cure smoky chimnies,
however bad they may be, would endeavour to get rid of the blacks
that darken the atmosphere of the world of amusement in London, a
great boon would be conferred upon Society. We may, however, hope
that there will very soon be a change in the wind, for the breath of
public approbation does not always lie in the same direction, and when
the object is worthless the current of air is very likely to shiftsuddenly
round; which is the result that, with reference to the present glut of
Ethiopians, we may every day anticipate.

THE ENSUING EXHIBITION OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY.
The Great Room at the National Gallery will soon become an object
of interest to those who are fond of self-contemplation. Our Trafalgar
Square Correspondent has put us in possession of the fact, that nearly
one thousand portraits have passed over the pavement, and the
physiognomist will soon have an opportunity of studying those endless
varieties of the “human face divine” which are to be seen every year
at the Royal Academy. A statistical account of the principal features
embraced in one of these Exhibitions would be very curious; and we

wish some MAcculloch of art would take the trouble to frame some
tables showing the relative proportion of pugs and Grecians in the
numerous noses which will stand forward, in a few days, as prominent
objects of art, to challenge the criticism of the connoisseur, and the
admiration of the public. We understand that some of the portraits
sent in for exhibition during the ensuing season were private speculations
of certain fashionable tailors, who hoped to smuggle a glowing descrip-
tion of a magnificent vest, or a registered Paletot, into the Catalogue.
THE defenders of this flagrant—by no means fragrant—nuisance
have discovered that it is conducive to public health and public morals,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
S FOR THE (THAMES) NAVY.
THERE is no doubt that the celebrated sea
songs of DIBDIN went very far towards
inspiring in the naval character of Eng-
land much of that indescribable some-
thing or other which made the name
of a British Tar synonymous with every-
thing noble, and sent the heart bounding
about like an old bonse at the very men-
tion of the word “seaman.” (We may
as well say, parenthetically, that a
“bonse” is a very large marble, if our
juvenile reminiscences do not mislead
us. It is not a “pot” nor a “ring-taw,”
but is considerably bigger than either,
and may be considered as a kind of Elgin
marble among its smaller associates.)
We have long since missed that enthusiasm which once hailed the
name of the Tar whenever it was pronounced, and we attribute the
decline of “honest JACK's" influence to a want of those beautiful naval
songs which used to be written concerning him.
We are afraid there is no possibility of reviving enthusiasm in favour
of the salt water seaman, but we are determined to try the experiment
whether the fresh water sailor—the Tar of the Thames—may not be
converted into a theme for the minstrel, and a subject for the constant
cheer of the theatrical gallery. We purpose, therefore, writing some
naval songs, the locality of which will be bounded on the east by Green-
wich, and on the west by Richmond Bridge. These termini will include
between them all that vast tract of water lying along the two shores of
the part of the river comprised within the space specified, including
of course the romantic little Isthmus of Isleworth and the Ecl Pie Archi-
pelago, with the Straits of Vauxhall and the Crookeds of Battersea.
Feeling the importance of these preliminary observations, and taking
a draft from our Pierian Pump-erected at great expense on our
premises, and being a force pump, of course—we proceed to mix a
Castalian preparation in our inkstand, and placing a steel-pen on a
holder made from wood cut from the hedge in which the tomb of VIRGIL
is embedded, we proceed to our poetical task.
No one can forget DiBDIN's beautiful song of “Poor Jack.” If any-
thing could possibly extinguish its lamp, as it stands like a rushlight
in the halls of Memory, sitting up till the last member of Posterity
comes home ; if anything could put an end to its burning, it would be
the snuffers of oblivion in the ominous form of our piece of poetry, to
which we give the title—not of “Poor Jack,” for we scorn plagiarism,
but—
POOR JONES.
Go, patter your lingo to landsmen and snobs,
'Bout danger by water, d'ye see;
With plenty of coal on my engine-room hobs,
A tight little steamer for me !
Why, a'n't our old captain, Bob TooDLEs, of Bow,
As tough as a steak when 'tis new ;
As long as Bob TooDLEs can take us in tow,
I don't care a farden—do you ?
Though the chimney athwart the two paddles should fall,
And threaten to fracture our bones,
What matter ? it argufles nothing at all
To a true British Tar, like poor Jones.
I said to our Poll, when I found her in tears,
As in Battersea's harbour we lay,
What argufies crying 7 I’m going not for years,
I'm only just off for the day.
Though tempests may howl, lass, don't howl in return,
With the winds there's no reason to roar;
Come, mop up your port-holes, such leakage I’d spurn—
Your stoker is true to the core.
But the heart of a seaman's so soft, d'ye see,
That, at sight of poor Poll and her moans,
I set to at blubbering as loudly as she—
Yes, piping all eyes was poor Jones.
But mind me; a sailor, whene'er he's afloat,
Should be like a bit of his craft ;
So, choking with tears, like an egg in my throat,
Iskurried the funnel abaft.
And over the boiler I manfully stood,
While my tears trickled down in a stream ;
So ye see, after all, that my weeping did good,
For my tears were soon turned into steam :
And as our bold skipper went easy ahead,
Poor Poll, 'mid her sighs and her groans,
Cried out, “That's the way that the boiler is fed,
They’ll blow up or boil down poor Jones 1”
3 #patt Biet.-à 3Little 3Patile.
(FoR THE KING OF PRUssIA).
A good father had long promised his children a treat; so one day he
called them together, and said, “You have been very good children,
and I think I can trust you now ; for the future you may dine with
me, and we will talk at dinner over your future prospects.”
The dinner at last took place, and the good father rose, and said,
“My dear boys, there is a lot of dry bread, which you may divide
amongst you ; you will also find on the sideboard some pump-water.
I know it will do you good, for a spare diet is the best for a strong
constitution. I have put a little sugar on your bread, because, on the
whole, you are good children, and I don't mind giving you plenty of
butter as long as you behave yourselves; but if you ask for anything
better—if you murmur about cheese, if you hint at fish, if you even
whisper about roast-beef, or dare grumble about not having a bit of
plum-pudding, you never shall dine with me again.”
This treat was repeated once or twice, and two or three of the elder
boys, who grumbled, were locked up; and one strong, rebellious fellow,
who had the impudence to ask for a drop of beer, was whipped and
sent to bed; till at last all the children rose, and said, “Father, your
dinners don't suit us : you talk very beautifully, but you give us
nothing to eat. Flesh and blood cannot stand it any longer. We are
very sorry to interfere with your arrangements, but we are determined
for the future to choose our own diet.”
The good father got into a tremendous passion, but, for all that, the
children set to work, and prepared a diet for themselves; and you may
be sure that they made it strong enough, and that, in time, they got quite
a vigorous constitution.
ENGLISH AUTHORS-AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS.
LEIGH HUNT, (whose quill was surely plucked from an eagle, and, like
the parent bird, ever and anon renews its youth,) in his delightful
Streets of London in the Atlas, has a pleasant remonstrance with
American booksellers on their use and abuse of English authors.
MR. HUNT is in Waterloo Place, and his talk is of MEsses. WILEY AND
PUTNAM, the American dealers :—
“An English man of letters certainly passes the doors of American booksellers in
London with very singular feelings. He knows they will snatch hold of his book the
moment it is published, sell thousands of copies of it on the other side of the Atlantic
without giving him the benefit of a stiver, and perhaps have the pleasure of seeing him go
by their London windows in the rain, while they are flourishing in a big house over his
head. We suppose it is all right, and proper, and consistent, and free-born, and inde-
pendent, and respectable, and slave-holding, and lovely, and going-h-head. It is cer-
tainly going another man's head, though with a considerable quantity of their own face
beneath it. Yet, after all, “how they can do it,” as the man said when he saw the New
Zealand young gentlemen eating their benefactor, is to us inconceivable.”
After all, this American practice of stealing a book from the author
is only an ingenious extension of the principle of stealing a man from
himself. An English writer is treated by America as America treats
her negroes: he is turned into ready money for the benefit of the smart
dealer who robs him. His brains are taken to market, and knocked
down to the highest bidder. We know that the best men of America
denounce this iniquity as emergetically as ourselves. MR. CoRNELIUs
MATHEws has done good service in what appeared the forlorn hope of
making Congress recognise the principle of honesty in the matter of
international copyright; and we have every confidence that eventually
American booksellers will—like Mrs. Chick—“make an effort” to be
decent, and cease to become the Fagins of letters—the “very respect-
able” dealers in stolen goods. Nevertheless, until such time arrives,
we must not cease to exhort and expose ; we must persuade and shame
America into honesty—America who, talking her mother-tongue, calls
England parent, and yet is every day committing felony upon her little
brothers and sisters.
But as the wit and beauty of Portia were enshrined in lead, so is the
genius of America enshrined in silver; in the metal whereof are made
American dollars. And that genius, still speaking our own English,
eternally cries in the pocket of JonATHAN the old, old words—with
hardly a difference—“JoNATHAN, get money; honestly, if it may be ;
but if not, go the entire animal, from the tip of the snout to the eend
of the tail, and get money.” Indeed, whilst America sells the bodies
of blacks, and steals the brains of the whites, she ought to take second
thoughts about a design for her flag. The stripes may remain ; they
are significant to the world of the American notion of liberty—lines of
bloody red, red as the gore that trickles from a negro's back; but the
stars, we think, admit of improvement. We would therefore have
them rounded into dollars. With such slight alteration, the Standard
of America would, for design, be perfect. Besides, there are no stars
to be seen in America; none. The sky, to be sure, has the like astral
glory with the sky of England; but surely the smart, book-stealing
American sees in JUPITER and VENUs, in all the planets, all the host
of stars—not stars, but dollars, dollars.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

{{20t) to #eep a good ſºleteorological Cable.
“DEAR PUNCH,
“I think I observe the weather as much as
anybody, and yet when I read the meteorological
tables, I never can make out from them whether
old BoBEAs has been kicking up a dust, or St.
WAUxhALL been raining cats and dogs, or HIEMs
has been favouring the metropolis with a new
series of outlines done in his usual style of frieze-
work. I am confident that not one person out
of five thousand understands what N.N.W. or
S.W.S. by E.W.N. signifies ; or can explain the
riddle of 73° Fahr., or guess the meaning of 63°
REAUMUR, which I take to be the name of the
Clerk of the Weather, and perhaps the 63° is the
amount of his age. It is time, I think, these
riddles should be given up; and, instead of indi-
cating the weather by figures and the letters of
the alphabet, which have enough to do on the
policemen's coats, without being collared also to
do duty for the wind, which is quite beyond
their compass, why couldn't some more intelli-
gible plan be adopted to record the changes of
the weather ? I have not the weather-wisdom
of MURPHY, but I send you my plan, which will
do for any country, excepting those, of course,
where the natives walk about in a constant state
of poses plastiques. It is indicated, you will see,
by the clothes—for what better test of the wea-
ther can you wish for than a person's clothing,
providing always he has changes sufficient in
his wardrobe, to keep pace with those of the
climate 2 But explanation is needless; you will
see what I mean by glancing your eye over the
following table :-

“Don’t the above articles of dress tell exactly the state of the

‘Summer Trowsers’ the very best sign of ‘change'? Isn't the “extra

A Word of Advice.
WHAT can be done with Ireland 7 Kindness, judging from the
speeches of Young Ireland, is thrown away upon her. Every sympathy
is shown to her distress, that charity can devise and money execute ;
but it all goes for nothing. She rejects the sympathy, and only keeps
the money. Instead of saying “Thank you,” she does nothing but
heap abuses on the hand that relieves her. We wonder what will
satisfy Ireland ' We think the best plan to bring her to her senses
will be to let her shift for herself for a twelvemonth. After a year's
punishment, with such ministers as O'BRIEN and MEAGHER, she will
be too glad to go down upon her knees, and say, in all bitterness, “I
am sorry for what I have done ; I will never do so any more.” We
. hope there will be no occasion to carry the punishment into
effect.
WANTER, a Member for the Western Division of the County of Gloucester.
He will be required to return thanks for the health of the Lord Lieutenant at
all the public dinners given in the county, and occasionally to attend Parliament.
Salary £300; also partial board and lodging, with two suits of clothes per annum.
Apply to Earl Fitzhakdinge, Berkeley Castle.
GUIDE TO COUNTRY GENTLEMEN.
PEASANT-PRESERWING.
LANDLORDs, for a long time, have given themselves up to pheasant-
preserving ; but a country gentleman will find that by preserving
peasants he will make a much better use of his estate.
A peasant preserve may be formed in almost any agricultural dis-
trict, where the peasants generally lie thick, but are often in poor con-
dition, owing to want of skill and care in their management. For the
most part they run lanky about the shanks, and are lantern-jawed and
round in the shoulders; but these defects may easily be remedied by
good diet and proper rearing.
You should box your peasants in clean, comfortable cottages, which
may be erected along road-sides, or in rows about villages, at a very
moderate expense. Let manure-heaps and other nuisances be carefully
kept out of the neighbourhood, for your peasants will require pure air
in order to be sound and healthy. The females should be provided
with washing, ironing, and needle-work. The young ones ought to be
sent for a reasonable time to school, and not set to weeding and keeping
birds off too soon.
Pheasant-preserving, or the preservation of any sort of game, is
unfavourable to the preserving of peasants. It must be remembered
that the peasant is a human being, of which creature wild animals are
the natural prey. The only way of preventing the peasant from
running after them is to give him plenty to eat; but this system has
not yet had a good trial. It might answer; but the safer plan would
be to shoot down all hares, rabbits, partridges, and pheasants on your
property. Encourage instead of destroying pole-cats, marten-cats,
stoats, weazels, kites, buzzards, hawks, crows, and magpies. These
will thin off the game, and hinder your peasants from going after it, to
the neglecting of their industrious occupations. If you like, however,
you can leave the peasants to pursue the game, which they will very
soon clear your land of. But if you forbid them from touching it when
there it is all around them, they will do so on the sly, and turn poachers,
which gets them into trouble, and into gaol, and the end is, that they
become criminals, and come to be transported or hanged.
The Beer-shop is very destructive to peasants; and you must
therefore do all in your power to keep them out of it. The peasant,
like the rest of his species, is apt to seek amusement, and kill care in
the readiest way that occurs to him. If, therefore, he is uncomfortable
at home, and has nothing better to do, he is sure to be off to the Beer-
shop. Accordingly, you must see that he is well lodged and cared for;
you should train him to read, and put a few books in his way to occupy
his mind with ; you may also encourage him to play cricket, football,
and so forth, in his leisure hours; for which purpose you should pro-
vide him a little leisure while it is light; and if you give him a holiday
now and then, so much the better.
For a peasant-keeper, you may employ a parson of the right breed.
Be sure to choose one who is active and alert, and not too much of a
gentleman to be above his business.
The proper food of the peasant is bread and beef; also bacon and
potatoes, with cheese, butter, and a sufficiency of malt liquor; but he
seldom gets more than the bread and the potatoes, and scarcely ever
enough of them. He will find himself in feed if you give him proper
wages ; those he usually gets average from seven to nine shillings
a-week, but at least twice as much as that should be given by any gentle-
man who wishes that his stock of peasants should be a credit to him.
When old and past work, do not pen your peasant up in a Union, as
is too generally done. A trifle will enable him to end his latter days
in comfort at home, with his mate, if still surviving, and brood.
By following these directions you will produce a fine race of peasants,
who will abundantly repay the capital you have laid out on them.
Their smiling faces, also, and cheerful looks, their attachment, and their
willingness to oblige, will afford you, you will find, the very best sport
that any rational country gentleman could desire.
A New Cry.
Ir is curious that the Irish still cry out for Repeal, and yet they are
rushing over to England in thousands every day. We begin to imagine
this cry of “Repeal” is directed against Ireland, considering the alacrity
the “finest peasantry” show in leaving it. It cannot be against
England, or else they would never seek food and shelter in the yery
country they so bitterly denounce. The best thing for Ireland will be
a poor law, with workhouses established all through the kingdom, on
a kindly, charitable plan, making the landlords contribute largely to
their support. The best cry for this purpose will be “Union.”

ADVERTISING CIRCULAR.
A NEw species of advertisement has lately sprung up. It
is advertising in the Court Circular. MR. Moon has lately
pursued this system to a very great extent. He has been
submitting to HER MAJESTY proofs of the engravings of the
royal guinea-pigs, and has received permission to make an
engraving of a magnificent clothes-horse in the possession
of PRINCE ALBERT. These interesting facts are stated at full
length in the Court Circular of last week. The scale of prices
which the Editor of the Court Circular charges for an adver-
tisement ought to be published. We should like to send him
an advertisement ourselves occasionally (stipulating, however,
to find our own grammar) when we attended at Buckingham
Palace to give HER MAJESTY a few choice readings from an
early copy of the next week's Punch. The fact might be
published thus :—
“Yesterday, Mr. Punch had the honour of making HER MAJesty nearly
die with laughter, by reading aloud the description .# policeman, who was
found accidentally in a house in Fitzroy Square, owing to the kitchen chimney
having caught fire. This unique specimen of a policeman is in a beautiful
state of preservation, and will shortly be exhibited at the Egyptian Hall.
Full particulars of this interesting curiosity are given in this week's number of
Punch. Price 3d.; stamped, 4d.”
We really think, if advertising is introduced into the records
of royalty, that it should be a matter of fair competition, and
that EveRTON, the patentee of the Prince of Wales's Toffy,
should have the same chance as the portrait engraver and
portrait publisher, who not only enjoy the monopoly at present
of all the royal patronage of the Fine Arts, but have the exclu-
sive privilege also of advertising for nothing in the columns of
the Court Circular every time they go to the Palace to have a
sitting from the royal canary, or parrot, or squirrel, or what-
ever it may be that is having its likeness taken. We direct
the attention of the authorities of Somerset House to this
shabby evasion of the advertisement duty, and call upon OLD
PARR, Moses AND Son, MRs. GoDFREY, and the EARL of
ALDBoRough, to be up, and raise a cry of “Throw open the
Advertisements of the Court Circular.”
DRAMATIC INTELLIGENCE.

MR. BARRY, the architect of this very beautiful building, has given a sly but very
severe dig at the Peers, for he has so constructed the upper house that none of the
speeches of their lordships are audible in any part of it. The Peers can neither
hear each other, nor hear themselves, nor be heard by any one else; so that, according
to MR. BARRY's plan, a debate has been treated as a thing to which it is worth
no one's while to listen. Considering what a common habit it has been for several
of their lordships to talk at the same time, this new acoustic regulation will be found
very convenient, for they can all speak at once without disturbing each other, or
creating the smallest confusion.

There is something very ingenious in so constructing the House of Lords that
liable to have the illusion destroyed by hearing what
their lordships are saying.
The effect is very imposing under present circum-
stances, for to the eye there is every appearance of a
dignified assembly, while the ear is not startled by any
of those dull platitudes to which, when the Peers speak,
they are in the habit of giving utterance. We think
BARRY deserves the thanks of the nation for having
rendered the debates in the upper house almost entirely
inaudible. If one of the Peers desires to speak out
more boldly, and with more meaning than any of his
colleagues, he will find no difficulty in obtaining a
hearing. The mere dummies might as well be dumb,
and it will therefore be no loss to the country to miss
the speeches they think proper to make, and which
now—as they cannot reach the reporter's ears—will
not be inflicted on the readers of newspapers.

formers, not only at the end, but sometimes in the course of a play or
opera. It is very hard that an artist is liable to be again “called out”
immediately after having given “satisfaction.” Considering the ex-
haustion that ensues after the exertion of a brilliant bravura, or screech-
exacting scena, it is really “too bad" to recall the vocalist for the pur-
pose of demanding a series of bows and curtsies entailing the utmost
fatigue upon the already worn out performer.
If actors and singers of the present day are like those of the past,
the inconvenience must be fearful ; for, with the stars of former times,
it was by no means an uncommon thing, after a scene of great energy,
for them to be carried away to the green-room in a state of prostra.
tion that would have rendered compliance with a call before the curtain
impossible.
It is well known, or at least it is boldly said by the dealers in dra-
matic anecdotes, that the celebrated EDMUNDKEAN was always wrapped
in a Witney blanket after playing Richard the Third; and George
FREDERick CookE was made up into a brown paper parcel directly
the play was over, so that had he been called for, he could not have
made his appearance, except as a bale of goods in the hands of a --
porter.
BETTERTON was always placed in a hot-bath directly the curtain
was down, and GARRICK sat with his feet in gruel for at least an hour
audience. To prevent
the possibility of dis-
appointment to the
public, it would be
as well that the per-
formers should be
allowed to be carried

THE MARQUESS OF WESTMEATH ON KILLING
BY LAW.
THE noble Marquess, a night or two since in the Lords, alluded to
the execution of the wretched woman Foster, at Bury. It appears,
that is, according to the perceptions of the Marquess, that the people
were so horrified by the protracted suffering of the woman, that they
exclaimed, “Shame, shame ! Murder, murder 1" The Marquess is as-
suredly in error. The people did not by such exclamations rebuke
the unskilfulness of the hangman, but the stupid wickedness of a bar-
barous law—a law proved to be wholly ineffectual in its implied end, that
of teaching a respect for the solemnity of human life, by judiciously
killing the offender. How many that composed the enormous crowd
at Bury were awed into respect for the law by the convulsive agonies of
one expiring woman 2 What feeling possessed the crowd as it broke up 7
Why, a feeling of disgust at the punishment, mingled with sympathy
for the criminal. And this is the majesty of Law 1 The judge dons
a black cap when he passes sentence. A cap and bells would be
more in keeping with the hideous mockery of common sense and com-
mon humanity.
The MARQUEss of WESTMEATH has evidently bent the powers of his
mind to the subject of hanging, that is, to hanging made easy. We
would he would shift his ground, and study how to make hanging un-
lawful. DRYDEN speaks of the wife of an executioner who, with
conjugal partiality, declared that any bungler could put a man to death,
but it was only her husband who could cause a man “to die sweetly,
like a gentleman.” If such an artist could be always insured by the
state, the Marquess would perhaps consent that we should continue in
the good old way of strangulation by rope. Nevertheless, hanging,
says the Marquess, on the authority of SIR Astley Cooper, is a pun-
ishment that presses unequally on different culprits. The heavy man
“suffers but little,” whilst the “light person suffers much.” To remedy
this, the Marquess significantly alluded to “executions in Germany,”
and the garotte (a Spanish machine of death), as being “more humane”
than the mode “adopted here.”
We are surprised that no peer vindicated the use of the halter as a
good old British custom, condemning every other plan of judicial
homicide “as un-English, and utterly opposed to the genius of the
nation.” In Germany, the two-handed sword, wielded by sinewy arms
practised at the work, takes the head clean off, with little inconve-
nience to the owner. Would the Marquess familiarise the use of the
weapon to the mob of the Old Bailey Or again, France drives a good
trade in guillotines, having, among other Gallic blessings indigenous
to the soil, shipped several cargoes of the ingenious toy to Algeria.
What say you, Marquess, to the guillotine 7 A free gift of such an
instrument by Louis-PHILIPPE, might help to restore the entente
cordiale between the two nations.
Seriously, however, we marvel that the Marquess, in his considera-
tion for the moribund criminal, did not eschew alike the notion of the
influence of rope or steel upon the culprit, until compassionately
prepared by inhalation of ether. This is a great improvement, and
would be worthy of the attention of the Marquess, were there not a
paramount duty to engage his attention—namely, not to study the
easiest mode of killing, but its abolition. Legislators hang for fa
“moral example,” which the people, in the disgust and loathing of their

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PARAGRAPHS FOR THE PROVINCES, OR SCRAPS
FROM “OUR LONDON CORRESPONDENT.”
ou have heard a great deal about the
ºn sinister influence of Col.FTTI in the affairs
of Greece; but you will hardly believe
that this man has become a member of
the company at Her Majesty's Theatre,
for the purpose, no doubt, of furthering
his designs by the aid of agencies in
this country. He has a fine voice, and
is an excellent actor, but the latter fact
ou will have anticipated from his well-
£º artifice in his ministerial capacity.
I am assured that MR. LUMLEY, the
enterprising manager of Her Majesty's
Theatre, was not aware of the political
position of ColeTTI when the engage-
ment was entered into ; and his appear-
ance as the Doge in the Due Foscari would not have been allowed, if it
had been known that he was aiming at supreme power. I do not
wonder that his voice was all-powerful in the Council-Chamber of OTHo,
for it fills the vast area of Her Majesty's Theatre very easily.”
“I have a great literary secret to impart to you, which I picked up
at the door of one of the Clubs, from a porter who enjoys my con-
fidence. My news is neither more nor less than this—which I hasten
to divulge for I am determined that your paper shall be the
first, either in or out of London, to communicate the startling intelli-
gence. Well, then, the fact is, that MACAULAY has quarrelled with the
Edinburgh Review, and has joined Lloyd's List, which is shortly to appear
under his avowed editorship. He commences the next number with
one of his brilliant essays, on Shipping ; and the Edinburgh Review will,
it is expected, merge in the Observer, to which it will form a quarterly
supplement. The corps of the Edinburgh .# thus dispersed, will leave
many of its writers free, and it is expecte they will go over in a
body to the Musical World, which will be enlarged to six times its
present size, and will be published every half-hour. By the bye, HAL-
HAM does not write a burlesque for the Olympic, nor is the lessee in
treaty with Dr. KAYE Shuttlewonth j though if these two eminent
men could be induced to combine their strength, an immense treat
might be expected.”
“You will be a little surprised to hear that the Ministers intended
to resign last Saturday, but I recommended them to reconsider their
determination, and they bowed to my judgment. . You know that I
foretold the downfall of PEEL at least four years before it happened ;
and, mark my words—the Russell administration will not last for
ever !—it may last one year, or two, or three, or four, or five, or,
perhaps, even ten ; but they are grievously mistaken who expect that
twenty years hence it will still be in existence. I do not pretend to a
gift of prophecy, but in this instance, at least, your London Cor-
respondent may be implicitly relied upon.”

E.
ENGLISH TENDENCIES.
RENch newspapers comment very severely on the
KING of PRUssia's opening speech to the Diet,
describing it as full of “English tendencies.” We
were not aware that for a nation to have the
liberty of talking without the power of acting,
was exactly an “English tendency.” Neither
did we know that a King making a speech three
columns long about himself, was an “English
tendency.” We never knew before, either, that
to give a nation a constitution, and then to
3 say it must not exercise it “for fear of the
consequences,” was altogether an “English
tendency.”
We were equally ignorant up to this moment, that for a sovereign
to present his people with the shadow of power and to keep the
substance himself, was an “English tendency;” or that there was
anything English in a king being frightened out of his life by “a
written sheet of paper;” or that there was an “English tendency” at
the present day to prosecute or to circumscribe the freedom of the press;
or that, when the QUEEN opens Parliament, she indulges in a long tirade
against the slanders of the periodicals, or inveighs in bitter invectives
against the caricatures levelled at the crown of the Albert Hat; or
that she apostrophises the different members of the House of Com-
mons as “Ye mighty men of Manx;” or speaks of “Beds” as her
“great pillar and support ;” or calls “Sheffield” “her right trusty
blade;” and so on, running through every county in the United
Kingdom, giving a bit of sugar to each, and declaring she shall never
despair of Fatherland as long as she can rely upon the “brave spirits”
of the Isle of Dogs.
We never recollect hearing the QUEEN talk in Parliament about her
“costly jewels,” or the “sword of mind,” and similar pretty figures of
speech which kings and queens make use of in melodramas and
romances, but never in public life. The only tendency we can discover
in the KING of PRUssia's speech is a tendency to the absurd, and we
took that to be peculiarly a “French tendency.” Our French contem-
poraries must not look for “English tendencies " in a KING of
PRussia's speech. . We might as well attempt to search for “French
glory” in the annals of Algeria.
“$bjects to tſje ºbject.”
THE City Commission of Sewers declare, in their Report, that
“for paving, draining, sewerage, lighting, health and cleanliness, the
City of London is inferior to no city in the Empire.” So excited is
this excellent body by the attempt to include the City within the ope-
ration of Lord MoRPETH's Health of Towns Bill, that it has burst
into song, “Facit indignatio versum.” We subjoin two examples —

Royal visit To stratford on Avon.
(FROM THE oldest INHABITANT.)
“Stratford-on-Avon, April 29, 1847.
~~~~i=- EAR PUNCH,
ºf ºx “This has been a
pleasant day for “my
own romantic town.'
QUEEN VICTORIA,
PRINCE ALBERT, the
PRINCE of WALEs,
the PRINCEss Royal,
and the PRINCEss
ALICE have all made
a pilgrimage to the
birthplace of our own
—the world's SHAK-
SPEARE ; and have
visited every spot
sacred and sweet
with the light and
odour of his name.
A very cheerful day,
Mr. Punch, has this
been to me; an old
man now, sir, and at
most within a year
or so of making my
bed in Stratford
churchyard, with the
yellow Avon mur-
muring at its side,
singing to the sleep-
ing dead. A cheerful
day, sir, for I have
seen my QUEEN —
may she live to the
years, escaping the
wrinkles, of ELIZA-
BETH !—yes, sir, seen
my Queen for the
first time, and the PRINCE, a tall, fair, good-looking gentleman, (by the bye, is there any picture of him?)
and the little PRINCE of WALEs and his little sisters, royal rose-buds all. And they all came to tread
the native earth of ShakspeaRE, and to look upon things that even to my old eyes seem to wear a
strange beauty and bloom upon them, seeing that they were all familiar things to him.
“Well, sir, the QUEEN, and her husband and her little ones (saving their presence), came this morning
from Oxford. The PRINCE, I have heard, as the new Bishop of the place, had a little business to do
there, so stopped a while by the way. However, the whole party, with two or three lords, and maids
of honour with faces blooming like fresh nosegays, crossed Clopton's Bridge, and entered Stratford
at 11 this morning. You may be sure, sir, that the bells waked up in the church steeple, and that all
the folks snatched up and scratched on their best clothes; and MR. MAYor flung himself into his
gown, and the Corporation and Bailiffs made themselves ready, and the Constables run out with their
staves, and everything was done that on a sudden could be done to honour the visitors. I was at first
mighty sorry that there could be no more preparation; but the words of SHAKSPEARE welled up in my
memory, and I was quite content. What saith he 7–
* For never anything can be amiss
When simpleness and duty tender it.”
“And in this spirit the QUEEN–I could see it—took all our hurried bravery. I think I know a
SHAKSPERIAN face when I see it; that is, a face that has fed and fed upon the page of SHAKspeARE,
and has within it a part of the honied wisdom, the deep intelligence, the sparkling wit, the brooding,
rippling humour of our miraculous WILL. Well, sir, our QUEEN has a little of all this so subtly
mixed, so sweetly tempered in her regal face, that I know SHAkspeaRE must again and again have
beat with the pulses of her noble heart.—(But, forgive me, sir; I am apt to ramble.)
“The Lord of the Manor met the QUEEN, the Lord with the Mayor by his side, and invited HER
MAJESTY to take some refreshment; but she refused it with the sweetest smile, and desired to be taken
forthwith to Henley Street, to the House in which SHARsPEARE was born. When the royal carriage
came to the beginning of the street, the QUEEN ordered it to stop. Then PRINCE AlBERT lifted her
out; and QUEEN and PRINCE, taking their children by the hand, walked—just like any pilgrims—walked
down the street to the immortal homestead. It was pretty—more than pretty—to see the greatest
QUEEN of all the world pay such homage to SHAKSPEARE, to the man who has surrounded her own
England—surrounded it, even as the sea—with a never-ebbing flood of glory. (Again your pardon,
sir; but I am an old man, and must talk.)
“Well, HER MAJESTY came to the house. As she looked at the outside, a beautiful smile broke upon
her beautiful face; and I thought—but my sight is none of the best—I thought that I saw a little
tear start to her eye, as she crossed the threshold.
“Well, sir, she walked upon the floor so softly—so reverently, I may say—you'd have thought she
was walking in a church. Then, as I understand from one of the Corporation, HER MAJESTY, with
the PRINCE and the babies—(Heaven bless all of 'em ()—went into the middle room, where SHAKspeARE
was born. Think of that rough, plain, simple room, sir; and of the light that dawned there ! What
are rooms of cedar, with purple and gold and porphyry, after that ? (But I must keep to my story.)
“Here the QUEEN, in the prettiest way in life, told the royal children what a great man had been born
in that room; a man who had done such mighty good to all God's creatures; a man that they must
learn to love for his goodness, and
to imitate for his wisdom. And the
sweet little creatures looked solemn
like, as though they understood every
word that was said ; and, with their
little pouting lips, promised never to:
forget SHAkspeaRE. You wouldn't
think it, sir; but our town-bailiff
almost burst into crying.
“Then the QUEEN and the PRINCE,
and the little children all wrote their
names in the visitors' book; as if none
of 'em were any more than one of us.
(To be sure, what is any crowned
head in that house, where Nature
crowned the baby head of SHAK-
sPEARE *—saving your presence, sir.)
“Well, the QUEEN left the house,
and, still walking with the PRINCE
and children, went to the Church. As
they entered the lime avenue, (in my
heart, sir, I was sorry for this back-
ward spring ; for there was scarcely
a leaflet out,) there was the Minister,
and the Beadle, and all the children
in their best clothes. And the
children began God save the Queen ;
but when they had finished the first
verse, HER MAJESTY bowed, and de-
sired them to chaunt SHAKSPEARE's
epitaph, as set to song by one JoHN
BARNETT, if I do not mistake. It
was sweet, sir, to hear their silver
voices trilling, trilling upwards, lark-
wise :—
*** Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbeare
To digg the dust enclosed here :
Bless'd be the man that spares these stones,
And curst be he that moves my bones.”
“This being done, the QUEEN pro-
ceeded to the Church, and entered the
chancel, wherein is the monument of
SHARspeARE. Not a word was said.
I could hear the watch of the Mayor
tick in his fob. And then HER
MAJESTY and the PRINCE, after
dwelling some time in silence, pre-
pared to depart. They again entered
their carriage at the end of the
avenue, and drove to the Grammar
School, whereat SHAKSPEARE, as you
know, sir, was a scholar. And there
—where SHAKspeARE used to sit—
was it not a pretty sight to see
Our Gracious Lady the QUEEN, with
her own motherly arms lift the
PRINCE of WALEs into the seat, and
tell him, from that time never to for-
get the great glory of his country-
man, SHAKSPEARE 1 And the dear
little fellow, (saving his presence)
coloured like a blood-red apricot, and
said, when he was a man he never
would l Oh, sir, this was a sight to
send an old man back into life, aye,
ten good years—begging your par-
don, sir.
“Well, sir, HER MAJESTY went to
the Mayor's house to refresh herself,
and she mirthfully called for a cup of
sherris sack, and therein drank “The
immortal memory of SHAKSPEARE.’
After this, HER MAJESTY drank “The
Corporation of Stratford ; ' and after
a short tarrying, again took her coach
towards Oxford.
“On parting with the Mayor at
the boundary of the county, HER
MAJESTY graciously informed his
Worship, that, in commemoration of
her visit to the house and tomb of
SHAKsPEARE, it would be her Royal
pleasure to institute a new order, of
universal merit—“The Order of the
Mulberry l’

sir, as a great blessing that I have been spared to see such a day: for
though Royalty can, by its homage, do no honour to the genius of
| SHARsPEARE, it does a great deal, sir—a great deal by example. This
| visit of the QUEEN to ShaksPEARE will make tens of thousands crowd
to house and tomb. Besides, the QUEEN honours herself and throne,
by honouring the greatest-mind that ever dawned in man—and that
man, an Englishman.

sir—with these old eyes I saw them : and yet I am told that in this

THE OLD WOOLSACK.
(DEDICATED TO Miss ELIZA cook.)
OH, the old House at home might be shabby and small,
And the new House is stately, and splendid, and tall,
But better I loved the old faded moreen,
Than the new silks and satins, and purple and sheen ;
For thro' that old House where I liked I could walk,
And in that old House I could hear myself talk ;
And though springy and soft the new Woolsack may be,
Oh, dearer by far the old Woolsack to me !
Thence ten times a-night have I jumped up to speak,
On its surface for hours I’ve displayed “Poses plastiques ;’
'Twas from it that at CAMPBELL mythunders I flung,
And showed to the Peers the rough side of my tongue.
Oh, bless its broad back and its shabby old facel
For, whoever sat on it I still found a place ;
How fiercely I thumped it, no care it displayed,
Nor how dirty the boots that upon it I laid.
Yes ; tho’ springy and soft the new Woolsack may be,
Oh, dearer by far the old Woolsack to me !
'Twas on it that by dozens I knocked off appeals,
'Twas on it that triumphant I wielded the seals :
When on it no reporter could e'er cut me short,
For whatever I said they were forced to report;
Now the rogues, when I rise, with delight in their looks,
Wink each at the other, and shut up their books;
And I feel, as I spout, that it’s no use at all,
For it's all 'twixt their Lordships, and me, and the wall.
No ; tho’ springy and soft the new Woolsack may be,
Oh, dearer by far the old Woolsack to me ! BROUGHAM.
New Coin,
THERE has been a talk about new coin in the House of Commons, in
order that we may gradually reform our currency according to decimals.
Tenths will certainly be a more convenient calculation for the Church,
a farthing will, in a little time, be a most convenient coin for subscribers
to the Repeal Fund. MR. SHEIL proposes that the new two-shilling
piece should be called “a Royal”—the one-shilling, “Half-a-Royal”—
and six-pence, “a Quarter of a Royal.” We should like more familiar
terms; for instance, why not call the two-shilling, “a Hog”—the
one-shilling, “a Pig"—and the six-pence, “a Suckling 2"
OR SALE—A GREAT BARGAIN. By a Sovereign who is giving up
the use of it—a Constitution, as good as new, having only been worked on
trial, though the owner has had it thirty years in his possession. The present
proprietor is parting with it merely because he finds it goes rather faster than suits
his convenience. It is admirably suited for any one in his position who wants
violent exercise; and is built after an English model. It will be disposed of on easy
terms, as the proprietor is anxious to get it off his hands.-Apply (post-paid) to F. W.,

CHAPTER III.
ARRIVAL OF MR. TAMERLANE CORKS-THE MARRIAGE-SERVICE
CLASS.
C. very hour's communion with
*R} Miss GRIFFIN charmed us
\' " with the growing belief that
$4 nature, just for once to show
what she could do, had made
in the mistress of Capsicum
House a perfect woman.
Every hour she rose in our
opinion ; and—it is the
faculty of genius—she
same time : we rose with
- her.
prepared for an admirable, and withal most original discipline
of the female mind in its tremendous development of girlhood
into womanhood, we were yet to be pleasantly astounded by the
genius of Miss GRIFFIN in her preparation of the giddiness of
maiden life for the serious truths of wedlock. Miss GRIFFIN,
however, felt the solemnity of her mission, and in the matter of
marriage, began with the beginning. Hence, her pupils were once a
month collected into the Marriage-Service Class, that by a proper
rehearsal of the ceremony, they might be perfect in all fitting self-
possession when the anxious time of performance should arrive.
“My dear sir,” said Miss GRIFFIN, “I have seen weddings that
have sent me into a twitter. Tears and tremblings
felt compromised by the weakness. No, sir; I like to see a woman
give herself away with dignity; as if she very well knew every scruple
of her own worth ; every atom of the treasure which, at the most
liberal moment of human life, she was bestowing upon man. It's a
great gift, sir, a very great gift; and therefore, as I say, I acutely
feel the humiliation, when I see a young woman give away her hand
as though she, forsooth, was the obliged party. All wrong—all very
wrong !” said Miss GRIFFIN, with a sigh. “A woman, sir, should
deal by her heart as she deals by a trinket at a fancy fair; ask a
man the highest price for it, and give no change.”
“No change, Miss GRIFFIN | No reciprocity of love "we cried.
“Well, not exactly that,” said Miss GRIFFIN; “but you know
what I mean.” Not quite ; nevertheless, in all gallantry, we bowed.
It was on an early visit to Capsicum House, that its mistress
revealed to us thus much of her discipline : we were therefore not
wholly unprepared for an introduction that in a few days followed.
We had paused at one of the girl's beds of sweet herbs, and with
dreamy eye were wandering from thyme to parsley, from parsley to
sweet marjoram, thinking of marriage as treated by Miss GRIFFIN,
when that lady, attended by a strange gentleman, approached us.
“Dear sir,” said that wondrous woman, “allow me to introduce
MR. TAMERLANE Corks, Professor of The Marriage-Service Class.”
“A clergyman?” we observed in a half-voice to Miss GRIFFIN;
for we thought we recognised in the neckcloth of the stranger the
established starch. “A clergyman 2"
“Why, no,” said Miss GRIFFIN, “although MR. Corks has several
pupils, young gentlemen intended for the church. He teaches 'em to
say grace with proper intonation at public dinners.
Indeed,” said
seemed to elevate us at the
Thus, albeit we were
Oh, I have
Miss GRIFFIN, with a slight burst, “I don't know why it should be
disguised—and, for myself, I feel quite above the prejudice—but, the
fact is, MR. Corks was an actor at Drury Lane Theatre.” Here MR.
CoRKs bowed with the tempered majesty of fallen greatness. “How-
ever, it was not for a man like MR. Corks to associate with camels,
and make companions of elephants ; and, therefore, in a word, you
may see in my friend TAMERLANE the Decline of the Drama.”
We bowed to the obvious truth. Looking again, we wondered how
for a moment we could have mistaken Cokks ; for we still saw the
track of the hare's foot upon his cheek, though a little obliterated by
the later occupation of his mind, divided as it was between the church
and the bar. His former practice as an actor had, notwithstanding,
all unconsciously prepared him for the double task. He took to the
stage as a walking gentleman, and, retiring from before the elephants,
left it as a heavy father; having in the course of five-and-thirty years
played all the intermediate parts. Hence, he could charge a young
barrister with the varying eloquence of a Marc Antony, making him
play upon a jury of twelve as though they were Pandaean pipes—or

he could load an advocate for the pulpit with the dignity of a Cardinal
Wolsey. (It is not generally known that Doctor ScARLET, who
went over from Protestantism to Puseyism—preferring his religion
coloured to plain—was got up in his most effective discourse by MR.
TAMERLANE Corks. However, we would not have this circumstance
talked of ; if known, it might injure the prospects of Capsicum
House. People are so prejudiced.)
“And how are the young ladies, dear Miss GRIFFIN ?” asked MR.
TAMERLANE Corks; as though—taking us for a part of the church,
the very humblest brick, or candidate for horse-hair and hunter of
yet unlittered ermines—he talked for a pupil; and therefore very
handsomely gave us a specimen of his powers of intonation. MR. CoRKS
had a remarkably fine range of voice: now it liquified into the Lydian
flute, and now fell in a lump to the Bartholomew gong. “How are
the young ladies 2" he asked, running the scale; “brilliant as dew-
drops on the damask rose ?”
“Just so,” said Miss GRIFFIN, slightly iced ; “but you know, MR.
Corks, I do not admit of such language here.”
“Madam,” rolled CoRks, like a muffled drum, “then I will take the
liberty of sacred friendship to say you are wrong. Again, I will say
it. To make the education of your young creatures complete, you
must have the Flattery Class.”
“I'm afraid of it,” said Miss GRIFFIN ; and she looked upon the
earth.
“Then, my dear Madam,” reverberated TAMERLANE, “you will send
them into a dangerous world with a raw and imperfect education.”
A brief spasm seemed to convulse the soul of Miss GRIFFIN at the
imputation; but she tossed her head, and broke into a placid smile. She
would not believe it. MR. CoRks, evidently glancing towards us for
support, continued—“Poor, unprotected things . Unless, with the
other transcendent accomplishments acquired at Capsicum House, they
are not steeled—I should rather say plated—against the wiles of
flattery, they are made doubly hazardous. Depend upon it, they'll
marry at the first offer; and that's a responsibility, Miss GRIFFIN;
yes, that’s “a burden, CRomwell !’”
templating the smallness of her own foot. “And therefore you must
have a Flattery Class, where all sorts of sugar-plums in syllables are
flung about, that when the young ladies get into the world they may
be invulnerable to the shot. Depend upon it—and I say it with feelings
I hardly confess to myself—depend upon it, Capsicum House must have
a Flattery Class : indeed, without it the Marriage-Service Class—
though I, as the examiner, say it—is altogether premature. A Flat-
tery Class, with the lessons selected from the British Dramatists. I
have every dramatist here—CoRks clapt the tip of his fore-finger to
his forehead—“and could do it in a week. A Flattery Class, eh,
Miss GRIFFIN ?” -
“I can't say,” said that thoughtful lady; “isn't it playing with
edged weapons 2" At this moment a gentlewoman with a serious
look, authorised by five-and-thirty years in a very serious face, came
from the house. “CARRAways,” said Miss GRIFFIN, “MR. CoRks,
you see, is here. Are the ladies ready ?”
“Been waiting, ma'am,” answered CARRAways, “this quarter-of-an-
hour and more.”
“Dear girls ; they're always so punctual 1 Now, sir, if you please: | -
we shall make no difficulty about you. Besides, as a marriage is very
seldom performed without the presence of some strangers, it is neces-
sary, for the acquirement of a proper demeanour during the ceremony,
that the girls should not always be alone. This way, if you please,”
said Miss GRIFFIN ; and she mounted the steps of Capsicum House.
We followed, crossing the threshold. We gently, tremulously trod the
floor, for varied feelings throbbed in our soles. In our time we
had visited many abodes of learning. Our heart had palpitated at the
theology of Oxford, and melted almost to tears with the mathematics of
Cambridge. We knew that we trod the halls and crossed the quad-
rangles of the future Bishops of England—the Judges of England
Nevertheless, we did not forget our manhood ; but, with head erect,
bore up against the load of awe that weighed upon us. This was at
Oxford and at Cambridge.
The thought of the Bishops and Judges of England was heavy—if you
will—awful; but still a distinct feeling. Shovel-hats and horse-hair
wigs, and silken aprons and ermine tippets (masculine), are all of them
very dear things. No Englishman with a heart as big as a cotton ball

SQUARE REDIVIVU.S.
LEICESTER
SUCH a change has come over Leicester Square l—It is quite spruce,
and clean, and handsome, compared to the dirty, vulgar, seedy, dis-
reputable Square it was a few weeks ago. The hedges are so smart
that they look as if they had been not only cut but curled ; the grass
has been trimmed, the plants have had their ends taken off, the walks
properly brushed and parted, and the lawn so beautifully shaven that
it is nov" as smooth as a dustman's chin on a Sunday morning.
The anonymous statue, even, who formerly hid its diminished head
in a perfect maze of a wilderness of weeds, has had its face washed,
and been scoured from top to bottom, and stands out at present
as good-looking a statue as a person would expect to see in a day's
march through London. The trees, also, begin to have the appearance
of trees, and can no longer be stigmatised as “birch-brooms in
hysterics.” The whole place has evidently been under the hands, of
the Reviver, and has come out with a new suit in exchange for the one
it lately had in Chancery; for we believe the secret of the improved
looks of Leicester Square is owing to LoRD CotteNHAM being no
longer its ranger and keeper. An ample provision has been made for
its maintenance, and a certain annuity settled upon it. It is to be
found in everything it wants, and provided with an establishment
and a staff—(a beadle's)—suitable to its position in London. Two
trustees have been appointed to look after it, and a six-foot beadle will,
it is confidently expected, be shortly invested with the cane of office
and absolute power over the boys and cats and dogs of the neighbour-
hood. In the meantime the following clauses have been drawn up for its
protection, and will be published in black and white on large boards
at certain distances round the Square.
Hieicester $quare 33rgulations.
| That no cat or dog, on or after this date, is to be allowed to enter the
Square without the express permission of the beadle.
That no boy is to get over the railings or through them, or to walk
on the top of them, under any pretence or spree whatsoever.
That no more oystershells or bricks are to be thrown into the in-
| terior ; and the inhabitants are requested to provide themselves forth-
with, in any other Square of London, with another dusthole.
That the railings must not be taken out for any purpose whatever.
That it is hoped no inhabitant will get over the railings in preference
to entering through the gate.
| That no band of music, and no organ boys, and no exhibition, espe-
cially of Poses Plastiques, can, under any patronage or excuse whatever,
be allowed in the interior of the Square, and no clothes are to be hung
| out to dry.
| That the inhabitants are not to cut down the trees for firewood, or
to remove the turf for fuel.
That the royal statue in the centre is not to be disfigured more than
it is at present ; and no man, woman, or child is to attempt to get on
His Majesty's horse, as his back is very weak, and will not carry more
than one.
| That no person will be allowed to enter without his hat or coat.
Wivat BEDELUs.
We shall never pass Leicester Square without looking at it with an
eye—it may be, two eyes—of affectionate interest ; for we believe it is
the only estate in England which has had the good luck to escape
| entire from Chancery—that awful bourne from which no property ever
returns. We hope the Square will be kept up properly, if only as a
| curiosity.
THE DIRTY LONDON ALDERMAN.
THE extraordinary antipathy to a washing which has recently been
shown by the Coporation of the City of London, suggests very
forcibly the old nursery song on the subject of the refractory urchin,
who recoiled from the purifying process of the washing-tub. The
following ballad will be found appropriate to the situation in which
the City has placed itself by refusing to come under the sanitary
operation of Lord MoRPETH's measure.
What cry when I’d wash you ! not wish to be clean :
There, got and be dirty—as always you’ve been ;
It's not worth my while to begin a dispute:
I'll not take the trouble to wash such a brute.
Suppose I should leave you, now, just as you are,
Do you think that the QUEEN ought to pass Temple Bar,
Or come to Guildhall with her husband, PRINCE A.,
To dine in a city where filth has full sway ?
Ah look at your thoroughfares, isn't it so 2
Is there one through which any clean carriage could go,
Without getting splashes all over the glass,
As through the thick mud it effected a pass 2
Your sewers—are they ever in perfect repair?
No ; they’re constantly open, infecting the air ;
And as to your gas—to deny it were vain—
There always appears something wrong in the main.
So, so I I have hurt you. "Tis useless to cry,
'Twill only wash down all the dirt from your eye,
But let kind Nurse MoRPETH at once interfere—
You'll be a good Alderman, won't you, my dear?
“War's The MATTER, EH2 "
“Oh, there's Always A somethInk! WY, I’ve BIN AND LEFT MY hopeka-
Glass IN A cab Now."
* 4000 Black Muffs."
ONE of the four thousand Ethiopian Serenaders has borrowed a hint
from a notice in a furrier's shop, and intends advertising his Massachu-
setts Company as “A FINE Collection of REAL SABLE Bohes.”

that the embellishments are all of a very magnificent and artistical character,
and that “high art” prevails not only from the top of the wall, but even down
to the lowest depth of the skirting-board. The impression upon the eye of the
| visitor is agreeable enough while looking at the house; but if he goes home
and falls asleep—which he is sure to do if he has been listening to a debate—
the effect of the frescoes and other adornments upon his dreams, is not so very
delightful. The extraordinary conglomeration of eccentric lions rampant,
meagre unicorns, and other animals, with the staring eyes and spectral figures
upon our turnup bedstead for that repose which a mutton-chop with our tea
and a clear conscience inspire, a dreadful nightmare was the awful consequence.
Our dream seemed to be ushered in with an unearthly symphony of carpenters'
hammers, painters' brushes, and a low rumbling accompaniment formed by a
conversation, sotto voce, on “high art,” and then our dream took the form of the
following—
BALLAD.
I dreamt that I sat in the House of Lords,
As MonTEAGLE spoke at my side,
And into that sleep which his tone affords
I did imperceptibly glide.
THERE is no doubt that the House of Lords is a very beautiful building, and
of departed kings, are not exactly the materials to form the beau idéal of a
vision of sleep; and accordingly, when we went home and threw ourselves down
There were lions too many to count—a host
Of creatures I knew not by name;
And I also dreamt—which puzzled me most—
That the figures were all the same.
Idreamt that huge monsters—a fearful band—
Were staring to such a degree
That the sight was more than I could withstand,
For they turn’d all their eyes upon me.
And I dreamt that King John's unearthly ghost
Stepp'd forth my homage to claim,
When I woke and I found’twas my bedstead's post,
But it frightened me all the same.
AN INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCE.
SoMEBody is at present advertising an article which purports
to combine twenty-four shawls in one; so that a husband
may make his wife a present of four new shawls per annum
for six years, without ever going beyond his first outlay. This
extraordinary wrapper reminds us of the cap made of a “single
sheet of paper,” which was capable of being twisted into six-
and-twenty different forms—from a church-window to a curry-
comb. A new shawl for every day in the week—at no
other expense than the trouble of folding—must be indeed a
blessing to mothers, an economy to husbands, and a source of
satisfaction to all parties.
We wish some ingenious tailor would invent a wrapper for
gentlemen, to answer the purpose of some ten or a dozen coats
instead of one, to which necessity sometimes restricts us for
a long period. We throw out the following hint to Court, or
some other ingenious member of the fraternity; and, if he can
make anything of it, we will give him the benefit of the patent
on condition of his rubbing off all old scores, and clothing us
gratuitously for the remainder of our mutual existences. The
following is our design:—
Make a good easy paletot, with double skirts—a pair of
long skirts outside and a pair of short skirts under them.—
1st Let down the long skirts, and you have a great-coat.
—2nd. Fasten them up, and let the short skirts fall down,
when you will have a dress-coat for evening parties.—3rd.
Pin the long skirts together, and you will get a cloak-4th.
Pin up both pairs of skirts, and you will have a comfortable
spencer.—5th. Throw one of the long skirts over your right
shoulder, and it will make a Spanish cloak.-6th. Take your
arms out of the arm-holes, pull the sleeves inside, and you
get a cape.—7th. Pin up a portion of the long skirts into the
long skirts half up, but leave the lappets of the pockets visible,
and the shooting-jacket thus formed will challenge any compa-

you are in a first-rate pair of trowsers.

ITALIAN OPERA FASHIONS.
WHILE we
admit, in com-
mon with our
contemporaries,
the merit of
º sical arrange-
ments at the
Royal Italian
| Opera, Covent
Garden, we
must (also in
common with
some of our
contemporaries)
call attention to the anomalies in fashion and dress that prevail in the
new establishment. Decorum is commanded by a printed notice at
the door, and violated inside; while “top-coats, white hats, and ||
umbrellas” are placed under a ban, in a placard, which is wholly set at
defiance by those visitors who, armed with the powers of renters, deny
the existence of any authority to regulate their costume... They
accordingly rush into the house in attire of the most miscellaneous
description. Paletots, registered and unregistered, are rife in the pit :
while there are two hundred Taglionis among the audience, to make
up for the deficiency of one Taglioni in the ballet.
The applause bestowed upon the singers very often smacks of the
umbrella-ferrule, and we frequently recognise the sound made by the
end of an ash stick beating in concert with Costa's bâton. Many a
virtuoso, not content with standing up for his favourite performer in a
moderate degree, must needs stand up on the cushions of the pit seats,
to show the extent to which his dilettanteeism is carried. We do not
blame the management of this establish
ment for the defects of which we complain;
if there is an intractable public to be
dealt with, there is, of course, no remedy.
Every effort is made by the lessees to “keep
the thing respectable;” but if some per-
sons will adopt peculiar notions of a crush
hat for what they
call “ Common
Garden wear,”
and if they choose
to adopt the early and uncivilised highlow of
our ancestors, for the “patent polish of a
brighter age,” it is not the fault of the con-
ductors of this establishment.
The virtuoso in ankle-jacks will insist on standing upon his rights as
pertinaciously as the aristocratic habitué will take his ground upon a
chaussure of superior quality.
We don't see how the rights of the public are to be interfered with,
if an attempt should be made to turn the stalls into a Grecian Saloon,
or something of the sort, and to intersperse the enjoyment of “liquid
harmony” with indulgence in liquids of a different character. We

waiter's in the stalls;” but who knows what it is all tending to ?
By the way, we may (also in common with some of our contempo-
raries) as well call attention to the blockade of the pit, which is one
among the curious features of this establishment. The entrance to it
is usually occupied by a double or treble file, through which it is diffi-
cult to force a passage to get in, and impossible to force a passage to
get out again. One rush is quite enough trouble to be put to in
getting into one theatre; but to encounter the same awful struggle
than the entertainment is worth, whatever may be its intrinsic
attraction.

PUNCH's SONGS FOR THE (THAMES) NAVY.
It is seldom that a storm on the Thames has been described with all
that poetic vigour of which it is susceptible. It is true that the river
is not often tossed by those terrific tornadoes which are felt in some
parts of our hemisphere; but the Reach of Chelsea is a miniature Bay
of Biscay. in its way, in windy weather. We have known the time |
when we have been obliged to scud in a lee-scupper close to the shore,
all the way from Vauxhall to Battersea Bridge, and at last been com-
pelled to throw the binnacle overboard, and bring the boiler quite taut
under main-gallant reefings. Nautical men will appreciate the diffi-
culty of the position we have described, though landsmen may not
know exactly what to make of it. The following naval song will
perhaps help the general reader to an understanding of the peculiar
peril of a vessel in such extraordinary bearings. On more than one
occasion have we been under the necessity of personally hauling the
spanker jib-boom right athwart the hawsers of the main-stay, when |
the difference of five minutes in the luffing might have sent us all to
the top of the lid of Davy Jones's locker; for happily it was not deep
enough to allow us to go any lower, and we therefore could not have
sunk to the bottom. However, the recollection of the whole thing is
quite vivid enough to have suggested to us the following naval song,
to which we have given the appropriate title of
| THE BAY OF CHELSEA, OH !
Loud roar'd the smoking funnel,
The blacks came down in showers ;
The steam-pipe coughs like one ill,
The smoke above us lowers;
The mud both thick and dark
Impedes our wretched bark:
There we lay,
Half a day,
In the Bay of Chelsea, oh!
Now dashed against the gravel,
We crumble, crash, and creak ;
At this rate we shan’t travel
A mile within a week.
Cries of “Return the fare l’”
Now rend the startled air :
“Did we pay,
Here to stay,
In the Bay of Chelsea, oh!”
At length a wished-for wherry
'Long side of us drew nigh;
The prospect made us merry,
The laugh rose loud and high ;
But when, alas ! we knew
'Twould not hold half our crew,
None were gay,
As they lay
In the Bay of Chelsea, oh!
A little ease to give her
(To make her float we meant),
At once into the river
Her heavy chimney's sent.
To swim she now appears,
We give three hearty cheers,
As we scud
Off the mud,
In the Bay of Chelsea, oh
A Delicate Attention.
A GRAND ballet has just been produced at the Académie Royale, in
Paris, under the title of Ozai. The scene is laid in “one of the islands
of Oceania.” The original title was La Tahitienne, and the scene was
laid in “Papetee;” but the government interposed, for fear the entente
cordiale might suffer from a supposed allusion to recent events in the
Pacific. They anticipated a pas seul ă la PRITCHARD, and a pirouette à
da PomARE, and no doubt fancied Lord Noh MANBY's feelings would be
hurt. This little incident is beautifully characteristic of the politest
people of Europe.
RATHER PERSONAL.
THE Bishop of Nonwich has given great offence to the Dissenters
by alluding to MR. BAINEs as “Somebody from Leeds.” If the Anti-
educationist had been called one of the “Nobodies from Leeds,” perhaps
his friends would have been still more dissatisfied.
EDUCATE THE SUPERIOR CLASSES.
ANY" one who has doubts concerning the sad want of education
amongst the superior classes is requested to read the letter of the
MARQUIs of LoNDoNDERRY, to Lord John Russell, published in
the Morning Post. It is so crowded with errors that it is evident
the noble MARQUIs has such a contempt for the very first principles of
education, that he does not even mind his letters. We think that a
commission ought to be issued to inquire into the state of education
of those who have to legislate upon the education of the people. The
mass of evidence collected, would, we are positive, be something
appalling; and if HER MAJESTY does not issue the commission, Punch
certainly will. .

YOUNG IRELAND
Is so young that, like an unweaned baby, it does nothing but kick
and squall, and bend its little fists, and look blue in the face; the while
BRITANNIA—placid, unmoved nurse—allows it to roar its little bellyfull.
“When it's tired, 'twill go to sleep.”
Within these few days, however, Young Ireland has been very
uproarious—but withal, very harmless. MR. Charles Gavin DUFFY,
in the Music Hall of Dublin, a few evenings ago, said it was
“A curious fact that the Macedonia, which was coming here from America, laden with
food, was at one time a British ship of war (cheers, and cries of “More power / '). Did
Lond John Russell not fear that Irishmen might begin to think the only way British
º: { war could serve Ireland was by falling into the hands of the enemies of England?
(cheers).”
Oh, DUFFY 1 and would you desire that the tricolor, the stars and
stripes, should fly over English oak, as “the only way to serve
Ireland 7" - No, DUFFY, you had no such thought ; but you wanted
to be treated to a shout, and, DUFFY, you got it.
A MR. Doheny very much desired to rescue Ireland “from her
murderers.” He, moreover, considered LoRD RUSSELL's head—that is,
off his shoulders—due to Ireland. He
“Declared that many a minister had his head cut off for less criminal conduct (cheers),
and if England was a just nation, the blood, the head of Lord John RUssell would be
offered as a trifting expiation of his crimes against the people of Ireland (cheers).”
We have seen boxes, and other nicknacks, inscribed with “A trifle
from Margate; ” but there is something awful, nobly great in the
notion of a box, containing LoRD RUssell's head, shipped at Liverpool
for Dublin—a box marked, “A trifle for Ireland "
There are some idle, foolish men, whom we cannot better compliment
than by disbelieving what they utter. MR. Dohexy is precisely one
of these. He is a mere word-flourisher, and therefore just to be pitied.
Could we think him in earnest, we should believe him a subject
requiring the speedy attention of a police-officer.

T H E POET BU N N ? S N EXT O P E R A.
THE manager of Drury Lane has been so pleased with the behaviour
of his new quadrupedal company, that he has it in contemplation to
write an entirely new grand dramatic lyric, for the purpose of intro-
ducing the docile brutes in a manner worthy of their great abilities.
The Elephant (JENNY LIND) has been heard to complain, by grunts and
groans, of the insignificance of the part assigned to her in the Desert,
and she has declared, as emphatically as a flourish of her trunk can
express, that she will no longer walk on in a procession like a mere
supernumerary, with the PRINCE or PERs1A on her back; and she hints
that she will some day or other throw up not only her engagement but
the individual she is made to carry, for she is determined that she will
no longer be thus put upon.
The splendid old Camel, who, from her being continually in full
blow, goes by the name of CAMELLA, has also turned rusty—as rusty
almost as her own coat–at the very little that is made of her in a
dramatic point of view ; and indeed it is chiefly on account of dis-
agreeables of this kind, that the engagement of the brutal troupe was so
soon made to terminate. The spirited lessee has therefore made up
his mind—in a very small envelope of course—to write a libretto, for the
express purpose of introducing some of the leading members of the
|
programme, which we have much pleasure in furnishing.
Mammoth Establishment, should he sway the destinies of old Drury
next season. We have seen—in our mind's eye—a sketch of the
The
piece is to be called—
THE ELEPHANT OF THE EUPHRATES :
ok, THE CAMEL OF THE CAUCASUS.
The first scene will represent a common on the borders of Abyssinia,
in which a flock of Camels will enter to a gallopade, which their
drivers will accompany with a chorus. Hassan will then come forward
and sing an Aria Buffa, to which the Camels will furnish a refrain by
the tinkling of their bells, and the whole of the brutes will be so
trained as to keep their eyes on the conductor's bâton; the group will
retire, and Clorinda will advance, leading her favourite Elephant with
a silken string, and singing a ballad—the gem of the piece—the words
of which we are happy to be able to give entire.
“When o'er fair Libya's barren waste,
I look upon thy massive form,
A simple maid I stray,
Thy heart is not a stone,
Intent on joys I ne'er can taste, That beats with impulse fresh and warm,
Though happy others may ; For thou art all my own.
[The Elephant will dance during the symphony, and curtsey during the
applause. .
“oh, wherefore should I madly trust
The fickle human heart?
For man, alas! is only dust,
Which comes but to depart;
[The Elephant dances and curtsics as before, during the applause and
symphony. -
While thou dost never glide away,
Like straw on river thrown:
Yes; thou art all my own!"
The above specimen will furnish some idea of the materials of which
the anticipated Opera will be composed. There will be a grand quin-
tette, introducing two Camels, the Elephant, a Cassowary, and a Boa.

3 #rettp 3Little Game
FOR PRETTY LITTLE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY.
An amusing game is that of building ships, and seeing whether
they will float. You must first get some oak timber and knock it into
shape anyhow, till it begins to look something like a tub. Then take
your ship to the seaside and see if it will float ; but if it will not, you
must take it out of the water and pull it to pieces again, and begin
making a fresh ship. Do this until it does not sink. When this is
the case, you can begin putting in your guns ; but, if it should roll
over, which is very probable, you had better carry away your ship
before it goes to the bottom, and pull it to pieces again, and patch it
and construct it on quite a new plan ; but if after all, it does nothing
but roll over, you had better put it aside for firewood, and lose no more

Snip.
The most amusing game, however, is to build some four or five ships
at the same time, as like one another as two eggs, and to launch them
all together. It is great fun to watch them in the water. One will
pitch, the other will toss; one will roll, and another will do nothing
at all but show a strong desire, like a stone, to go to the bottom.
This sport is very diverting, and never tires, no matter how often you
may repeat it.
You may play at this game as often as you like, for you can come
to no harm in trying the experiments, as you do not go in the ships
yourselves, and have nothing to pay for the amusement. It is the
stupid English nation which pays for all.

Punch AND JENNY LIND.
T was impossible that Punch could fail in
assisting at such an event as the débùt of
the veritable JENNY LIND, whose inaugu-
ration as the prima donna of the world
will be ever memorable in the annals of
the Opera. To endeavour to give any
description of her charms as a singer and
actress, would be as vain as to endeavour
to represent the brilliance of the sun with
a ha'porth of gamboge ; or to produce a
brick, and request the looker-on to form
from it an idea of such a building as the
Colosseum. To say too much is impos-
sible; to say half enough is more impos-
sible still ; and to flatter is the most im-
possible of all; for we might as well send
for a pot of paint in order to paint the lily,
|
or cover a sovereign with a layer of Dutch
metal, as endeavour to paint JENNY LIND's
splendid achievements in their appropriate
colours. From the first moment of her
entrance she kept us in a state of enchant-
ment, and it was difficult to break the spell
at the conclusion of the opera. The critic
of the Times has truly described the delight
she afforded as a “new sensation,” and we
feel that it is a new sensation which must
be repeatedly gratified; for, having once
heard, we long again to listen. To those
who cannot go repeatedly to Her Majesty's
Theatre, we fear we ought in charity to
say “Go not at all; ” for once brought
within the influence of the Swedish magnet, resistance will be impossible.
A little Jenny is a dangerous thing;
Hear oft, or taste not the Linderian spring.
Expectation had indeed been raised to its highest point ; but it was evident, from the first
few notes she sang on her first night, that expectation had lagged far behind the exquisite
reality. To call JENNY LIND the Swedish Nightingale is a compliment to the bird, which will
put an additional feather in his cap—or, we should rather say, his tail—for the remainder of
| his existence. We need not say, that but for the prompt attendance of friends we must
have sunk under the fascination of the Syren, whose advent is the commencement of a new and
splendid era in the annals of our Italian Opera. The music of Roberto il Diacolo is still ringing
in our ears, with its splendid orchestral effects, so gloriously brought out under the directing
bâton of BALFE, and its vocal and dramatic beauties so magnificently developed by a combination
of first-rate vocalists. STAUDIGL's personation of the Fiend-father is so terrifically truthful,
that every printer's devil who has persecuted us for copy since the first night of Roberto il Diarolo
has brought that great artist to our recollection. One would imagine that STAUDigl had
been living on brimstone and treacle for a month previous to his débât, so thoroughly did he
appear “native and to the manner born” in his unearthly character. The debút of JENNY LIND
is a thing for which we have already swept
out a snug little corner in our memory, where
the circumstance lies enshrined under the
crystal shade of the brightest reflection. MR. |
LUMLEY has not only made his present season,
|but many seasons to come, by having brought
the Swedish Nightingale—no—this Song-bird
of Paradise—to his Aviary in the Haymarket.

It is gratifying to find that this series of
lyrics is already beginning to inspire, upon
the Thames and at the various wharves along
the river, a sort of feeling similar to that
which prevailed at our seaports during the
war, and in fact saved the country. The
pierman at the Temple has been seen prac-
tising private hornpipes under the money-
taker's shed, and is rapidly adopting a
phraseology in conformity with the good old
naval character. He has twice denounced
the clerk who delivers the checks as a land-
lubber, and has begun to drop tears of sen-
sibility, at the rate of a pint per day, over
the recollection of his pretty Poll of Parson's
Green, and his friend HARRY HANDRAIL of
Hampstead, This all looks as if we were
going in the right direction; and if we suc-
ceed in planting a row of sentiment all the
way down each bank of the Thames, we shall
begin to feel that, whatever happens, we have
got a Thames Navy. Hitherto our fresh-
water sailors have wanted that intensity and
depth which gave so much value to the
British Tar in the time of Nelson ; but we
have every hope that we shall instil into the
metropolito-nautical character a spirit that
will render him finally equalin many respects,
and inferior in few, to the heart of oak of our
immediate ancestors.
The following short but pithy lyric touches
tunefully, though mayhap mournfully, on the
Thames seaman's farewell to his wherry. The
original air goes by the name of “Poor Tom.”
We detest plagiarism, and will call our song
by the name of
POOR NED.
Now, farewell, my useless wherry,
Rudder, mat, and sculls, farewell;
Never more to Bucklersbury.”
Shall your Edward row a swell.
To the captain, quite a stranger,
On the Bridegroom's deck I go,
Where, not seeing there is danger,
A sloping chimney lays me low.
Then mayhap, when prostrate lying,
With the funnel 'thwart my head,
Even you my case descrying,
With a sigh may cry “Poor NED !”
Absentees.
A cARgo of Irish pigs was announced last
week at Liverpool. We are positive they
emigrated; they could not stand MR. MEA-
gh ER's harangues. We do not wonder at it;
it is enough to make every Irish pig blush
for his country when it hears such rabid
nonsense applauded as eloquence. Or perhaps
the pigs emigrated from a feeling of envy,
as they found it hopeless to compete with
Young Ireland in the prodigious amount of
gammon.
• Bucklersbury is, we fear, a little inland, but n'importe.

SHAKSPEARE'S HOUSE TO BE SOLD.
WE are requested to give insertion to the subjoined
communication: a letter from New York, addressed
by MR. BARNUM, the “guide, philosopher, and
friend” of GENERAL ToM THUMB, to the Mayor
of Stratford-upon-Avon. **
“TO MR. MAYOR OF STRATFORD."
“SIR,-Seeing that the critters of English have
no use somever of the house of SHAKSPEARE, and
that the location is in the market for sale, I do—
as a citizen of the freest nation of airth—opinionate
that it might be made first chop on this side of the
everlastin ocean. For, understand me, Mr. Mayor,
SHARsPEARE is pretty well catawampussed up in
his own country by all sorts of foreign sarpints;
and his nose is out of jinte, and will never be set
strait agin at the English Court; and therefore,
you see, Mr. Mayor, we–free Americans, children
of the star-spangled banner—we, who are the only
people on airth who understand English in the
clear grit that that 'varsal critter SHAKspeARE
writ it—we ought to possess the location in which
he fust saw the light, afore any other nation under
the blue canopy. ShakspeaRE's house is a drug
in England; but wouldn't it be a beauty, put upon
wheels, and drawn through all the States?
“And so, Mr. Mayor, jist say the number of dollars that your
Stratford critters want for the immortal location, and I'll consign 'em
slick; or if you’d like—in these tarnation hard times—the vally of
the house in breadstuffs, or hams, or molasses, or any other airthly
fixings, I'll swap strait ahead—I will And as for gittin the house
over here, I’ve a notion that I'd ship every crumb of it.
“I propose—to do the tarnation handsome thing to the immortal
critter—that GENERAL ToM THUMB should act SHAKSPEARE jist as he
has acted NAPoleon. A smartish compliment this, I think, to the
ivverlastin Bard. The Gen'ral has rehearsed a lot on it, and will—or
I'll be whipped for it—be jist as much at home in SHAKspeARE's
house as ever SHAKSPEARE was himself. The Gen'ral has been
I shall show him fust as MASTER SHAK-
sPEARE goin to school, “with his soapy mornin face,’ as the critter
himself says ; and then as the lover after the gals, writin a epic to
their eyebrowses ; and then as the soger—in the uniform of the Colum-
bian Flyshooters, in coorse; and so on, all the stages. And then the
Gen'ral will appear writin Hamlet, with his eyes a rollin in fine frenzies
—he does it tarnation beautiful already: and then I shall show him
a plantin the mulberry-trees for future generations, and laurels on his
own account.
“In a word, I have got MR. CHARLEs KNIGHT's ‘Life of Shak-
speare,’ and, as an honest citizen of the smartest nation of the airth,
intend to send the Gen'ral through every one of the five hundred and
forty-four pages, makin the curtain go down with the Gen'ral, sittin
with a goose-quill in his hand, and floured for a marble bust at

THE HEALTH OF THE METROPOLIS.
In answer to many inquiries about the health of the Metropolis, we
are requested to state that it is “pretty bobbish,” and that the
Metropolis and suburbs are doing as well as can be expected for this
time of the year. It is the opinion of many medical men, who have
known the Metropolis for years, that its health would be considerably
improved if the sanitary regulations were better observed in the City,
and about Mary-le-bone and other unhealthy parts, where its circu-
lation has been for a long time very irregular. They say that a few
draughts of a bill, which is being compounded in the great laboratory
for all sorts of drugs at St. Stephen's, would do those parts all the
good in the world. They also report that, as soon as the fine weather
will allow it, the Wellington Statue should be removed. The Metropolis,
there is no doubt, would be very much relieved, and will look all the better
for it, as the Statue has been, for months, a dreadful weight upon its
mind, and has quite robbed it of its good looks—so much so, that
many of its oldest admirers would not believe it was the same Metro-
polis they had seen only a year ago.
PUNCH*S PRIZE NOWELISTS.
CODLINGSBY.
BY B. DE SHREWSBURY.
The noise in the old town was terrific ; Great Tom was booming
sullenly over the uproar; the bell of Saint Mary's was clanging with
alarm ; St. Giles's tocsin chimed furiously; howls, curses, flights of
brickbats, stones shivering windows, groans of wounded men, cries of
frightened females, cheers of either contending party as it charged the
enemy from Carfax to Trumpington Street, proclaimed that the battle
was at its height.
In Berlin they would have said it was a revolution, and the cuiras-
siers would have been charging, sabre in hand, amidst that infuriate
mob. In France they would have brought down artillery, and played
on it with twenty-four-pounders. In Cambridge nobody heeded the
disturbance—it was a Town and Gown row.
The row arose at a boat-race. The Town boat (manned by eight
stout bargees, with the redoubted RULLock for stroke) had bumped
the Brazennose light oar, usually at the head of the river. High
words arose regarding the dispute. After returning from Granchester,
when the boats pulled back to Christchurch meadows, the disturbance
between the Townsmen and the University youths—their invariable
opponents—grew louder and more violent, until it broke out in open
battle. Sparring and skirmishing took place along the pleasant fields
that lead from the University gate down to the broad and shining
waters of the Cam, and under the walls of Baliol and Sidney Sussex.
The DUKE of BELLAMonT (then a dashing young sizar at Exeter) had
a couple of rounds with BILLY BUTT, the bow oar of the Bargee boat.
VAvAsour of Brazennose was engaged with a powerful butcher, a
well-known champion of the Town party, when, the great University
bells ringing to dinner, truce was called between the combatants,
and they retired to their several colleges for refection.
During the boat-race, a gentleman pulling in a canoe, and smoking
a Nargilly, had attracted no ordinary attention. He rowed about a
hundred yards ahead of the boats in the race, so that he could have a
good view of that curious pastime.
ahead; then he would wait, surveying the race, and sending up
volumes of odour from his cool Nargilly.
“Who is he 7” asked the crowds who panted along the shore,
encouraging, according to Cambridge wont, the efforts of the oarsmen
in the race. Town and Gown alike asked who it was, who, with an
ease so provoking, in a barque so singular, with a form seemingly so
slight, but a skill so prodigious, beat their best men. No answer
could be given to the query, save that a gentleman in a dark
If the eight-oars neared him,
with a few rapid strokes of his flashing paddles his boat shot a furlong
travelling-chariot, preceded by six fourgons and a courier, had arrived
the day before at the Hoop Inn, opposite Brazennose, and that the
stranger of the canoe seemed to be the individual in question.
No wonder the boat, that all admired so, could compete with any
that ever was wrought by Cambridge artificer or Putney workman.
That boat—slim, shining, and shooting through the water like a pike
after a small fish—was a caique from Tophana ; it had distanced the
Sultan's oarsmen, and the best crews of the Capitan Pasha in the
Bosphorus; it was the workmanship of Togrull-Beg, Caikjee Bashee
of his Highness. The Bashee had refused fifty thousand tomauns from
Count BouTENIEFF, the Russian Ambassador, for that little marvel.
When his head was taken off, the Father of Believers presented the
boat to RAFAEL MENDozA.
It was RAFAEL MENdozA that saved the Turkish Monarchy after
the battle of Nezeeb. By sending three millions of piastres to the
Seraskier ; by bribing Colonel DE St. CornichoN, the French envoy
in the camp of the victorious IBRAHIM, the march of the Egyptian
army was stopped—the menaced empire of the Ottomans was saved
from ruin ; the MARCHIONEss of STOKEPogis, our Ambassador's lady,
appeared in a suit of diamonds which outblazed even the Romanoff
jewels, and RAFAEL MENDozA obtained the little caique. He never
travelled without it. It was scarcely heavier than an arm-chair.
BARoN1, the courier, had carried it down to the Cam that morning,
and RAFAEL had seen the singular sport which we have mentioned.
The dinner over, the young men rushed from their colleges, flushed,
full-fed, and eager for battle. If the Gown was angry, the Town, too,
was on the alert. From Iffley and Barnwell, from factory and mill,
from wharf and warehouse, the Town poured out to meet their enemy,
and the battle was soon general.

CURIOSITIES of (ADVERTISING) LITERATURE.
HE advertising literature of the day certainly
demands a DisrAELI—the Elder—to embalm its
numerous curiosities. The Times has, within
even the last week, teemed with some of the
choicest specimens of interesting and amusing
matter, describing the wants, the offers, and the
achievements of our fellow-creatures.
In the first place, we find that “a man and his
wife are wanted—the man to be acquainted with
the lineage and movements of the aristocracy,”
while the woman will be “required to clean the
offices.” We need not remark on the dreadfully
ill-assorted match that is presumed to have been
made by the parties sought for in this advertise-
ment—a husband “acquainted with the lineage
and movements of the aristocracy,” (and of
course, therefore, living intimately with them
in their lofty circle,) with a wife who “will be
required to clean the offices;” the man a con-
firmed and successful tuft-hunter—the woman
an active searcher after cobwebs.
There are so many badly-matched couples in the world, that we
should not be surprised if the man on intimate terms with the aristo-
cracy, and his charwoman of a wife, should be speedily forthcoming.
The husband's gay society out of doors is so perfectly compatible with
the domestic drudgery of the wife at home, and the sort of union so
often exists, that we are perhaps wrong in classing this case under the
head of Curiosities of Advertising Literature.
The next specimen, however, comes fairly under this denomination ;
for it comprises the offer of a lady to dye hair permanently either
brown, light brown, auburn, or black, and to show her own hair as a
pattern of every one of these colours. This lady of the rainbow
tresses must indeed be an interesting phenomenon, with her beautifully-
variegated head of hair decked in parti-colours, like the dress of a
harlequin. There is something extraordinary in the devotion she shows
to her art, in cultivating half-a-dozen different patches of an equal
number of hues on her head, and being willing to exhibit the absurdity
as a specimen of her talents. Nothing but dire necessity can, we
fear, have suggested such a sacrifice. We should think that, in the
slack season, her exhibition of herself as the piebald lady, at sixpence
the head, would prove a considerable source of revenue.
The next literary curiosity, culled from the advertising columns, is
the announcement of the United Dentists' Tooth Powder. There is
something rare in the fact of the dentists having forgotten all profes.
sional jealousy, in order to rally round one particular dentrifice. The
United Dentists are, we know, not by any means united on general
matters; but here is a dentrifice which has provided them with a sort
of more than neutral ground, where they may be not simply forgetful
of hostility, but positively harmonious. Had the specific been a
mineral cement, we should not have wondered so much at its bringin
them together; but there is something astounding in the union effec
by mere Tooth Powder.
One"more curiosity, and we have done. An auctioneering firm has
advertised the sale of the “library of a gentleman in good condition.”
One naturally inquires what the condition of the gentleman can have
to, do with the sale of his library. Perhaps the fact is stated to
show that the gentleman is not so out of condition—so thoroughly
done up—as to be forced to sell his library. Nevertheless, as the name
is not published, the caution appears somewhat superfluous.
Tºrull and void.
ONE of the securities that was offered by England for the loan
advanced by the EMPERoR of Russia was Ireland. The Emperor
instantly declined the bargain upon any such terms, for he declared
with great warmth that it was preposterous to suppose there was the
slightest security in Ireland.

THE HOOP AND “ CAT” NUISANCE.
STREET NUISANCES-TIP-cat AND IRon HOOPS. --
“YouTH is the time for enjoyment,” says the sage, who was a great
fool for his pains, in encouraging those juvenile sports which “sages”
are sure to find ully inconvenient. Far be it from us, however,
to check the exuberance of youthful gaiety, to seize the hoopstick from
the hand of early playfulness, or emancipate the (wooden) cat from the
grasp of boyish buoyancy. Nevertheless, we think that in the public
streets the pastimes of the young ought not to be allowed to endanger
the shins of the aged, norought the iron hoop of infancy to be permitted
to trundle between the decrepid legs of tottering longevity. “Crabbed
age” may well earn its epithet when a wooden missile, technically
called a cat, springs up into the eye moistened with the tears of old
associations, or knocks off the wig, respectable through having been
paid for, from the pole venerable, through having not a bit of hair
upon it.
Our own feelings will not let us interfere; but the street-keeper is not
under this sentimental restraint, and in his hands therefore we leave
the matter.

CAPSICUM HOUSE-FOR YOUNG LADIES.
CHAPTER IV.
THE MARRIAGE-SERVICE CLASS.–MISS FLUKE IN FULL BRIDAL
DRESS.
REMEMBERING that spasm of the heart as the door opened, we think
with moderated admiration of the valour that takes a man clean up to
artillery. For resolutely jumping from our natural timidity, we are
sure of it, we caught a sublimer heroism than ever yet surprised the
early soldier, one moment pusillanimously sick at heart, and—(the
cannon thunder)—and the next the aforesaid heart burning with the
blood of dragons. For—in all sobriety we ask it—what, what is a park
of artillery, what twenty guns conscientiously loaded to the muzzle,
to twenty young ladies charged to the mouth with the Marriage
Service 7
ere are men—brave, fragmentary men—at Chelsea and Green-
wich, who would wince at the question ; would heavily shake the head
at the very provocation of the comparison.
And therefore we took the liberty of crowning ourselves with a
chaplet of immortal greenness when we found that we had conquered
the craven within us; and stood, with only here and there a nerve
vibrating—like harp-strings touched by beauty's fingers — stood,
receiving the fire of forty eyes, levelled at point wedlock.
And then the hero melted in the man Two minutes, and we had
humblest admiration. We felt that we stood in the presence of twenty
of the future wives of England, and our spirit bowed to them as to
creatures sent into the world to make it habitable for men. What
love, what tenderness, what capacity in those twenty bright ones to
make this otherwise cold, bleak, dirty, sloppy world warm, and trim,
and snug to man as a ring-dove's nest . Such were our harmonious
thoughts—such the music that broke in our brain. And then we
looked into their eyes; and then we thought—“Sweet little things :
If they only knew their strength ! But then, they never do 1"
We say it, there were twenty marriageable young ladies all in a row.
Twenty young ladies; the meanest of the twenty beautiful; the others
by most delicate gradation sublimating to the angelical.
(Now it is with some confusion we confess that, in the way of
description, this is all we can do for these young women. We have—
as we promised—dived souse into our ink-bottle, and have despairingly
| groped about for every imaginable beauty;-but no ; after an hour we
rise to the surface, with nothing but the head ache. And yet what
|fairy treasures, what immortal jewels lie at the bottom of that Black
Sea, and a man only knew how and where to dip for them 1)
“Where is Miss FLUKE 7” cried Miss GRIFFIN, with a cold, edgy
voice; and no young lady would take it upon herself to answer. In
a moment, we had counted the class : there were but nineteen.
“Where is Miss FLUKE 7" repeated Miss GRIFFIN ; and, we could
see it, CARRAways shrank at the query as from an east wind.
At the moment the door swung open. “Here, ma'am " " cried Miss
FLUKE, and that young lady bounded into the room as a kid would

Miss GRIFFIN drew herself up as though determined never to come
down again. “Why, what mockery is this 7”
“Mockery, ma'am " " cried Miss FLUKE, as though she ran all the
syllables into one. “What mockery, ma'am f"
We may here make it known that Miss FLUKE, being the last
comer, had never before attended the Marriage-Service Class. But
that young lady possessed an earnestness of disposition that at once
carried her into the very heart of a subject; her treatment of Weal
Stuffing, before lamented by Miss GRIFFIN, always excepted. Hence,
the pupil had determined to do all honour to the tuition of MR. TA-
MERLANE Coaks, and to appear in the fullest bridal dress that her
wardrobe rendered possible. She wore a white satin gown or slip :
(though why a gown should ever be confounded with a slip we cannot
discover). And over this gown was another gown of lace. She had a
veil, hanging in white clouds about her like a fairy in a pantomime;
and tenderly clasping her head—and seeming very comfortable there
—was a wreath of orange flowers. Indeed, if we except a certain
audacity of sparkle in her eye, Miss FLUKE looked a bride to the life—
to the tenderest and warmest life.
“Miss FLUKE,” said Miss GRIFFIN, a little confounded by the
saucy, rebellious demeanour of her pupil—who, with the prettiest
affectation of awe, stood with her red lips wide open, and her swimming
eyes as fixed as they could be, for the laughter that was breaking in
them, staring at her awful governess—“Miss FLUKE, I should very
much wish to know where you expect to go to ?”
“To the altar, ma'am,” snapped Miss FLUKE, as though she had
anticipated the question.
“To the altar!” echoed Miss GRIFFIN; and then she raised her eyes
to the ceiling, and, as though soliloquising, solemnly ejaculated, “Poor
man—whoever he is l’”
“Isn't this the sort of dress, ma'am 7” asked the sparkling, un-
abashed Miss FLUKE. “Except the diamonds, and that the lace isn't
real Valenciennes, I’m sure I’ve made it all up from a wedding
at St. George's, in the Morning Post. The bride fainted, ma'am.”
“And do you read newspapers, Miss FLUKE *" asked MR. CoRKs,
in his deep and dulcet tones.
“Yes ; I like the politics—I don't care for anything else,” answered
FLUKE.
“Politics 1" whooped CoRks.
“Yes, you know : the births, deaths, and marriages. Wouldn't
give a pin for anything else,” repeated the pupil.
Here Miss GRIFFIN instantly armed herself with her worst of
terrors. Nobody could know what she suffered to threaten such a
penalty; but, certainly, Miss FLUKE-unless she compassed complete
and immediate amendment—would be ignominiously expelled from
Capsicum House. And what would then become of her ?
Miss FLUKE bore the threat with the hardihood of a confirmed
criminal ; for she merely brushed out her flounces with her hand, gave
a twitch to her orange wreath, as though to tighten it for the cere-
mony, and slightly bent back her shoulders with an expression of
energy and self-decision. Her whole manner said—“Let us to mar-
riage, directly.” It was clear that Miss GRIFFIN was a little
appalled by the demeanour of her latest and youngest pupil ; and, in
momentary helplessness, turned her gaze upon MR. CoRKs. That
worthy man immediately lightened the dilemma. He put on his
gayest look, and spoke in his most cherished falsetto.

appointments may make the illusion of marriage more complete. Is it not sº, my dear young lady ?

half slumbered, half winked on the cheek of Miss GRIFFIN ; who, all unconsciously to match the
smile that opened the mouth of CoRKs, smiled very widely herself.
| “Ha 1 ha hal” cried the sharp-eyed Miss FLUKE, laughing in every bone of her body. -

Miss PALMER—FLUKE's next companion—a fair, quiet girl of nineteen, with flaxen hair and
blue china eyes, looked wonderingly at Miss FLUKE, and was preparing herself to meekly deny the
imputation, when FLUKE, sharply nodding her head, said—“You know you did, dear; but never
mind.” - -
Miss GRIFFIN looked hopelessly upon her youngest pupil; and then, with suppressed despe-
ration, and something like a ghastly smile, said to MR. CoRKs—“It’s no use ; we had better go
on with the Marriage Service. That may tame her.”
Then there was a rustling sound, as the twenty pupils smoothed themselves and took close order ;
and we had seen enough of Miss FLUKE to feel assured, from her busy expression of face, that,

come what might, she was determined to distinguish herself. She had not endued her person with
white satin, lace, and orange-flowers for nothing. -
“It is not to be forgotten, ladies,” said Miss GRIFFIN, with a practised air, “that, according
to the most authentic returns, the population of the world is-is-it's very odd; but what is it,
exactly, MR. Corks 2"
“The learned MR. PINNock”—said CoRks, in thorough bass, to give weight to the authority—
“MR. Pinnock, who was a patient man, and had doubtless counted heads, says eight hundred millions.”
“I should say"—observed Miss Fluke, desolately ignorant of political economy—“I should say,
the more the merrier.” Miss GRIFFIN would not hear the rebel, so Corks proceeded.
I say equal, I mean so many million
little boys to so many million little
girls.”
“That's nice l" cried Miss FLUKE.
“Nice " shouted Miss GRIFFIN.
“I mean, ma'am, it's just as it
should be,” said Miss FLUKE, a little
confidently.
And Miss GRIFFIN could not denyit.
A DISPUTED GENEALOGY.
“Tugglesham Rectory, May 5, 1847.
“SIR,
“My family's means are limited,
and we cannot buy a Peerage every
year : but our own name is to be
found in that volume, (see Knightage,
page 976–Tuggles, SIRT,) and we
are interested of course in every other
member of the , aristocracy of the
greatest country in the world.
“Not being in a position to pur-
chase every new edition of our
favourite work as it appears, I have
caused an interleaved peerage to be
constructed, in which it is the custom
of my wife and daughters to enter,
in manuscript, those changes which
death or marriage may cause—are
daily causing—in the ranks of the
patricians of the realm.
“Yesterday Mrs. Tuggles brought
me the following extract from our
paper, which I confess has puzzled
our family circle :-
“." On the 21st inst., at Bathwick Church,
Bath, (by the Rev. Henny Roghns, Rector
9f All Saints, Bristol,) Lieutenant-Colº
Sir Robert Gyll, late of the i5th King's
Hussars, and Guard Yeoman of the Guards to
his Majesty William IV., youngest son or ºf
HARRIET Flemyng, only daughter of HAMMIL-
Ton FLEMyNG, ninth EARL or Wigron, and
9APTAIN WILLlam Gyll, of the 2nd Life
| Guards, First Equerry to his Royal Highness
| The Duke of Sussex, only son of A Lognº
| Gyº, of the city of London, Yeovenny House,
| Middlesex, and Wraysbury House, Bucks; to
| JANE PRick Thomason, widow' of Hºnºr
| Byfield Thomason, Esq., of Peachfield,
| county of Worcester, only son of sm Epwº
and Lady Thomason, of Great Pulteney Street,
| Bath, and youngest daughter of Sir John and
Lady, Pinhohn, of Wingswood Park, Isle of
Wight. After the ceremony the bride and
bridegroom returned to Lady thomason's to
|a, select breakfast, prepared for the occasion,
when the happy pair left for Gloucestershire.”
“That the respected bride and
bridegroom should return to a select
breakfast prepared for the occasion
when they left Gloucestershire, I can
understand. At my own union with
MRs. TUGGLEs, her mother-in-law,
MRs. CAPTAIN RAM, gave a morning
banquet, for which she sent me in the
bill, so that I well understand the cost
and nature of those entertainments.
“But it is to the genealogical part
of this hymeneal announcement to
which I would at present refer. Are
we, sir, to conclude—
“1st. That his late Majesty,
WILLIAM IV., was the only son of

“What, sir, I ask, are we to conclude from these astonishing state-
ments 2 If true, they strike at the roots of every genealogical tree in
the kingdom ; if incorrect, they are likely wofully to mislead many a
family of that aristocracy which I educate, and of which I am proud

- are—I have it upon the best authority
C- —occasioning very great anxiety at this
moment to several European Courts.
The EMPEROR NICHOLAs, who has his
own luck and the proverbial good for-
tune of another individual, is the pro-
prietor of these Ural and . Siberian
regions, and is thereby placed in pos-
session of ready cash sufficient to pay
money down for the rest of the habitable
globe. The Ural rivers run with gold;
and gold as big as a Cossack's head is
dug up in lumps, plentiful as potatoes,
= by the Polish patriots doomed to Siberia.
This circumstance, as you may suppose,
has given Lord PALMERSTON great un-
easiness, and—I have it from a distin-
guished door-keeper—a Cabinet Council
was held upon the subject yesterday at Buckingham Palace. The
Council sat so long that HER MAJEsty insisted upon sending in a
bottle of sherry and some Westphalia sandwiches to her exhausted
Ministers. This little trait on the part of the QUEEN is—it must be
ſº
confessed—worthy of the best times of English hospitality.
“It appears—(you will be the first to publish the secret)—that
Nicholas, wishing to make a profitable investment of some of his sur-
plus gold, has sent in a tender, offering to purchase the whole of Ireland
of the mercenary Saxon. I have heard the precise sum named ; but it
would be premature to mention it. When, however, I inform you that
a celebrated architect has been ordered to inspect the Bank cellars
with a view to their enlargement, some idea may be entertained of the
amount of bullion to be paid down.
“LoRD PALMERston-this I know—will not consent to the sale of
Ireland, and, it is thought, will quit the Cabinet upon the question;
for LoRDs Russell and GREY insist upon the measure, as the means of
putting England into ready mcney. Between ourselves, a receipt
#. to legalise the transaction, is now in preparation at Somerset
ouse.
“Who could have thought that “the first flower of the earth, and
first gem of the sea” would have ever been worn at once in the button-
hole and crown of the EMPEROR of Russia 2 This will be a great
triumph to the Young Ireland party, relieved as they will be from the
oppressive, inhuman, atrocious, bloodthirsty (forgive my feelings, but I
write as a juvenile Irishman), avaricious, contemptible, disgusting yoke
of the infamous Saxon 1 The Russian dove will bring the olive to the
shores of Erin, and the amiable Cossack water his steed on the briuk
of the Liffy
* “The EMPERoR NICHOLAs has also made a very handsome offer to
Louis-PHILIPPE to purchase France; but His Majesty holds out for
higher terms. Portugal, and subsequently Spain, will in due time pass
to the EMPERoR as very cheap penn'orths. Your readers will doubt-
less be surprised at this intelligence; but all I can say is, if any iota
of it is incorrect, blame me.”
“JENNY LIND has made a great sensation. She can run to Q,
descending to X flat. The QUEEN was present on JENNY's appear-
ance; and after the first act, sent round to her a splendid night-
ingale, hatched at Stork AND MoRTIMER's—the body of chased dead
gold, with diamond eyes, ruby bill, and emerald claws. JENNY appeared
in the second act with the trinket in her hair, and curtseyed very
significantly to the royal box.”
... “There is at present a great rage for amateur theatricals. A play
is to be got up in the course of the month at Exeter Hall, for the
purpose of obtaining funds to whitewash St. Paul's. It is a gratifying
fact, that the existence of the cause has brought together, in perfect
harmony, gentlemen of opposite principles. I am fortunately enabled
to transmit you the names of a few of the actors. For instance, there
are SIR. R. H. INGL1s, MR. BRIGHT, SIR Rob ERT PEEL, MR. DisrAELI,
SIR ANDREw AGNEw, and the Poet BUNN. Colonel SIBTHoRPE refuses
to act, but has consented to sing Hot Codlins between the play and the
farce. I have not yet heard the names of the pieces, inasmuch as they
are not yet fixed.” -
“You R LoNDoN CoEREspondent.”
The National Shipbreakers.
WE think the Admiralty, instead of giving their ships frightful
classical names, which the sailors can never pronounce, and which
mean nothing, might christen them in such an intelligible manner that
their future destination and glorious career would be understood at
once. For instance, they might call them “The Piecrust,” “The Female
Promise,” or the “Lower's Wow,” or “The Child's Plaything,” and so on,
after articles which are generally supposed to be made only to be
broken up.
THE fashion of tailors, pill-makers, quacks, and tradesmen, having
their portraits painted for the Academy, in the hopes of the adver-
tisement doing them a deal of good, has led to the practice of artists
having two prices 5–one in case the picture is accepted, and a much
lower one in case it is refused. This has been the cause, however, of
a curious dispute.—MR. Jack Boots, a wealthy bootmaker, called
upon his artist, in Brook Street, the other day, to pay for the beautiful

you have only given me £40. You must

accepted, you were to pay me £100."
“Perfectly true,” replied the original,
who was as oily as his portrait; “but
I do not consider my portrait is in the

the indignant artist. “Why here it

Nothing could induce MR. JACK Boots
to add another penny to the £40; and
as the case has been put into the hands
of MR. BRIEFLEss, the question will
soon be tried — whether the Octagon

question is, who would be his sureties 7 The best thing, perhaps the
most friendly act to Young Ireland, and the quickest method to
restore the riotous young gentleman to reason, would be to put him
under confinement for a short period, for we really cannot believe that
the young fellow is in his right senses, or he would never have
behaved in the mad manner he has been doing lately. It would not
be a bad move for the Government to take out a writ de lunatico

dence to prove how incapable he is to manage his affairs. If the
commission is granted, we ask as a particular favour to be the counsel
engaged on that occasion. What a case we would make out for the Jury

PUNCH or THE LONDON CHARIVARI
THE NEw House of LoRDs, L.
Every day's experience proves the important fact, that the new
House of Lords is built in such fearful defiance of acoustic principles,
that hearing has become a very difficult operation, instead of—as it
used to be when nonsense was being talked—a very painful one. Some
of the finest bursts of oratory are now doomed to become lost in the
regions of space; for there is something in the construction of the
building that macadamises sentences the moment they are uttered,
breaking them up into little bits, and frittering them away in the fret-
work of the mediaeval tracery of the ceiling. If a peer raises his voice
to its highest pitch, it is ten to one that his nominative case will find
its way to the clock, his adjective will stick fast in the hangings of the
throne, his verb will drop down upon the floor, his accusative will whiz
out through the door, and nothing but his vocative will, perhaps, reach
the Reporters' Gallery. As it is exceedingly undesirable that so much
aristocratic eloquence should be entirely lost, some ingenious indi-
vidual has it in contemplation to introduce a system of telegraphic
signals, by which their Lordships may hold a debate in dumb show or
pantomime. The difficulty of making any audible comment upon a
speech, as it proceeds, has suggested the use of a variety of gestures,
by which it will be possible to indicate the usual emotions that their
Lordships are in the habit of expressing. -
Wefurnish a few specimens for immediate use; and if they are found
effective, we shall be happy to supply a more
opening of both eyes, and a
raising of the arms with an air of bewilderment.
The different degrees of assent might very well
be exhibited by means of the umbrella, with
which several of their Lordships go already pro-
vided; or, there might be an umbrella-stand for
the general use of the House, to which any peer might
resort on his wishingtogive eitheramodified or an entire
assent to another's proposition. The modified assent
could be easily conveyed by holding the umbrella in the
mannershownintheillustration; while an entire assent,
or perfect opening of the mind to
conviction, would require nothing
more to give it expression than an
unfurling of the parapluie, with an
abandon proper to the sentiment of
confidence.
A mere protest of a difference of
opinion should be represented as
coming from the heart, and a touch
| of indignation should be adroitly thrown into it.
There would be, perhaps, a little of the “more in
sorrow than in anger” in the gesture above de-
scribed; but this is an improvement upon the more
offensive mode of protesting that sometimes pre-
vails among their Lordships. Dissent and defiance
will perhaps require somewhat more claborate
A demand for “order” would be doubtless one
of the most constantly-recurring proceedings of
the Upper House; and for this ->
we propose to provide by a E
motion, after the fasion which
the annexed engraving indi-
cates.
We trust that some influential
- peer will bring our code of signals before the at-
º tention of their Lordships at the
- first convenient opportunity, and
- - we have little doubt that the
- scheme will be adopted with ge-
- neral cheering and loud cries of
“Bravo. 1"
This reminds us that our code
of signals comprises none for the expression of this
ecstatic delight; and we therefore conclude by offering
the drawing annexed, as a design to be followed
action, but the mode of expressing the latter is
perfectly obvious.

NEW MUSICAL PRODIGY.
Every one is tired of the Ethiopians, and we get so angry as nearly
to turn black in the face whenever we hear them mentioned. Some-
thing, then, is wanted, of an entirely novel kind, to replace the void
which will, we hope, be soon occasioned by the clearance of Ethiopians
from the face of the town, upon which they remain at present like a
dark spot that has hitherto defied the soap of injudicious praise, and
the scrubbing-brush of harsher criticism. We propose, therefore, to
effect a cure of the prevailing epidemic by establishing a sort of counter-
irritant; and we have therefore invented a species of piano, which can be
simultaneously played and danced upon by any infant prodigy who is
in want of a job; and as several of them have been for sometime out of
work, there will be no difficulty in finding one to execute the task
for which she is required. Our piano will have its keys elongated and
widened to such an extent as to form a sort of stage or platform, upon
which the prodigy will execute a solo, combining a dance and its appro-
priate accompaniment in the same movement.
The prodigies already performed by the fingers will be arranged for
the toes, and some of the most difficult pieces of HERzwill afford ample
opportunity for that activity of caper and energy of entrechat that the
danseuses of the present day are so anxious to cultivate. For the
benefit of the classical virtuosi, who love to be lulled to sleep by bits of
SEBASTIAN BAch, there can be performances arranged to include selec-
tions from his fine old lugubrious Op. 86—a title suggestive of the
most vigorous imagination and large clusters of masterly masses of huge
scholarship. How the admirers of the Razumousky quartette in F,
which sent the Musical Union into fits of passionate ecstasy lately,
with its graphic bit of contrapuntal colouring in A, ten flats—how
would these dilettanti enjoy this composition, danced deliciously off the
piano we have invented . We beg leave to warn the world that we
claim this invention as our own patent. It is true we do not yet know
how the instrument is to be made; but the idea is ours, and if any one
dares to make use of it, we will bring down upon him the power of an
injunction, and the just indignation of the Right Honourable Loºp
Cottenham.
Europe's uncle.
The EMPERoR of Russia, in the kindest spirit, is lending money to
every country whose affairs happen to be in an embarrassed state. We
advise his Russian Majesty (if it is necessary to advise one who knows
how to look after his own interest) to hang out in front of his palace
at St. Petersburgh the emblem of his new profession—the three balls—
and to write up the usual inscription, “Money Advanced to ANY
AMoUNT.” We should excessively like to see one of the imperial tickets,
but we suppose we shall be able to buy up one shortly for a very small
figure at DEBENHAM's sales of “Unredeemed Pledges.”

“Now, dear young lady. You are to remember the peculiar

“That is, from one hundred millions,” chimed in Miss GRIFFIN ;
“leaving ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand

Miss GRIFFIN meekly assented, MR. Corks standing up as bride-

A has very recently been cut off by the thrush
or the measles, one of the most extra-
ordinary human curiosities under the sun.
The individual in question is a Colonel
of Dragoons. He does not stand twelve
inches high ; in fact, he does not stand at
all ; although, from top to toe, he measures
about a foot, or one-sixth of the average
stature of the Dragoon. Although placed
at the head of a regiment, he has never yet been known to give the
word of command; This speech consisting of sounds which are wholly
inarticulate. The Colonel is a very great favourite with the ladies,
although he pays them no manner of attentions; and they pronounce
him handsome, though his features are so indistinct that it is impossible
to describe the shape of his nose, or to say, with any certainty, of
what particular colour his eyes are. Besides, albeit that his head is
almost bald, there is not on his lip the least vestige of a moustache,
nor on his cheek the slightest trace of a whisker.
The brave will sometimes shed tears; but this officer is subject to
paroxysms of weeping so frequent as to be extraordinary for a Colonel
of Dragoons, and his grief is more noisy than that usually evinced by
the soldier. Military men are often wont to drown their sorrows in
drink; but those of our Colonel are most readily assuaged by food,
although it is said he sometimes finds a solace in the bottle.
The Colonel's habits are as extraordinary as his person. He has
never yet been known to go to bed, although he sleeps several times a
day—taking his rest, like an old campaigner, when and where he can.
It is always necessary to carry him to his couch ; yet he has never
been known to be intoxicated. He has seen no service but that of a
domestic nature; nevertheless, he is almost constantly in arms : how-
ever, he has frequently smelt powder, the odour of which is to his
nostrils as that of the violet. It is also reported that he has received
a wound in the arm, at the hand of a vaccine lancer. Although not a
veteran, he is quite toothless, and consequently cannot take animal food,
but is obliged to feed either by suction or upon spoon-diet. His uniform
is a cap and a sash, with Imperial purple and cambric facings. It is,
indeed, one peculiar to the Infantry, in which corps, strange to say,
he ranks, notwithstanding that he is a Colonel of Dragoons.
In confirmation of the above particulars, we refer the reader to the
Morning Post of the 12th inst., which states that—
“The EMPERon of Russia has nominated his last-born grandson, the GRAND DUkr
Yº!" ALEXANdhowitch, to the command of the regiment of Dragoons of the
ularoi.
We trust that our friend NICHOLAS will officer all his forces in a
similar manner, and that henceforth the world will hear nothing of the
Russian artillery but the rattle.

NORTH-AMERICAN BOOK-MEN.
His will, doubtless, prove one of the most
extraordinary exhibitions ever seen in
Europe. The North-American Book-
men are natives of Nooyorck; landed
in Liverpool by the brig Whole Hog,
Captain Go-a-head; and will be ex-
hibited for the first time next week
at the Royal Institution. They are
two men, two women, and a baby—of
the Book-men tribe from the Brord-
weigh; and are the first that, from
their unprincipled and thievish habits,
could ever be induced to visit a place
of civilisation. This opportunity of
gratifying the English author, and the
student of English letters, has only
been obtained by a party of gentlemen
(connected with the Literary Fund) who
have brought the Book-mento England
at an immense outlay of capital, with
the Christian view of enlightening
the minds of these North-American
savages, and if possible, of reclaiming them from their degrading and
disgusting habits. On the passage to Europe the baby was born at sea.
Now, had the baby (it is a boy) been born in the Brordweigh, there is |
but little doubt that, bred to the customs of these forlorn Book-men
—who do not know another man's property from their own—the
poor child would have been as morally lost as its unhappy parents;
but there is now every hope that the child will be placed in Paternoster
Row, and brought up in the respect of good men's good works.
These people are called Book-men, from their custom of living upon
leaves of every kind. Indeed, they will gobble any substance upon
which anything can be written or printed ; the leaves of the talipot,
properly sauced with printer's ink—the bulrush, whereof was made
the ancient papyrus, bark, parchment, anything soever that is printed
upon—these Book-men will greedily devour. But there must be ink
-printer's ink—English ink—enshrining the brains of English authors,
their brains, and heart, and blood—to make it particularly palatable
to these benighted Book-men, who are sometimes known under the
compound name of Amer-ic-amp-ublis-hers. As an instance of the
ravenousness of the tribe for this kind of nutriment, we may inform
the reader that the baby of these Book-men lived upon a number of
Dombey and Son, rolled into something like a sugar-stick, half the
voyage.
The following is from a modern author's work on The North-
American Book-men :-
“Miserable Bookman Thy hand has been against every one ! For
generations past thou hast hunted the English author like the beaver
or the civet-cat ; thou hast followed him like the wild ostrich, and
not caring to meet his eye, hast robbed him of many a Tale. Depriving
the British author of what Nature made his own—(but what the
Congress of the freest nation upon airth opinionates he has a just
right to be robbed of)—thou hast become cruel, fierce, insolent, and
—in short, a nuisance.”
(For particulars and habits of these Book-men see reprints of
English books). -
We are happy to state that several worthy Christians in and about
Paternoster Row—with other good men at the West End–evince the
THE BATTLE OF THE ARCADE.
THE traveller who has lately perforated the recesses of Exeter
Arcade, must have remarked that the southern chain of that inte-
resting pass is thoroughly depopulated. On making inquiry into the
circumstances, we have found that the barbarian horde of a brutal
bailiff has fallen upon the primitive inhabitants of that peaceful nook,
which has been the scene of the most heart-rending and window-
smashing struggles.
It is, perhaps, not generally known that the dwellers in this secluded
fissure of the nook which divides the plains of Catherine and North
Wellington, have hitherto led a life of rural indolence; and, indeed,
their Arcadian simplicity in taking shops
in this Arcade must at once be recognised.
The mild and patriarchal beadle had all
along exercised a kind of parental despotism
over the little family, and they might often
be seen, at the close of day, drinking together
the beer of urbanity from the pot of social
intercourse. One afternoon lately, ere the
simple Arcadians had retired to the fast-
nesses of their respective huts, a savage,
armed with a writ, came to spread terror in their hearts, and furniture
all over their pavement. The ruffian, aided by another of his unfeeling
class, had got a ji, fa, and, with a shout like that of
“Fr FA foree fum,
I smell the goods of an Englishman,”
he pounced upon the “little all” of an artificer of fancy slippers. Wild
shrieks instantly rent the air of that little inclosure—the Vaucluse, or
|Val Chiuso of the British Metropolis. The good old beadle, startled
|from his post-matutinal dose, was instantly on his legs, and, grasping
| instinctively his official staff, approached the scene whence the cry of
distress had arisen. There he found a table, evidently on its last legs,
giving creaks of agony as it was being torn away from the spot; while
its affectionate owner, folding its flaps to his bosom—like the green
leaves of hope—clung to its claws with passionate energy.
From the room above a cruel attempt was being made to let down a
sort of sofa ; while a frantic voice screamed out, “Ye shall not lay low
the ottoman!” The beadle had only time to mutter to himself—
“Woman in distress 1” before he was at the scene of confusion ; and,
throwing himself into a majestic attitude, with upraised staff, before
the shop-door, his sentiments formed themselves into blank verse
without any effort:-
“How now ! What's this? Hallo there ! Who are you?
Come, come ! You'll leave that chair alone, young man.
A writ, pooh pooh so, so, if that's the dodge,
You'll please to look at this, and this, and this.”
As he spoke the last line, he suited the action to the word, by
producing three several distresses for three distinct
quarters' rents which had never been enforced, and
which he contended gave him a prior claim to the
goods that were the subject of the struggle. The
bailiff barbarian sneered in the face of the good old
| man, who suddenly, from a mere lamb, sprang up
into a semblance of a lion. His eyes flashing with
recent double X, his nostrils dilating with dignity,
and his whiskers twinkling with electric fire, like
that on the back of a cat, when its back is regularly
greatest interest in the amelioration of the condition of these people; up, he sprang upon the table, and taking an attitude of defiance,
and will spare no pains to teach them the simple lesson of meum and defled the bailiff to
tuum.
We, moreover, understand that Messrs. LoNGMAN have—with their
characteristic benevolence and liberality—offered to take the poor baby
Book-man, and bring him up, decently and honestly, in their own
house. We trust they will be permitted to do this ; otherwise, there
is every fear that the child, on returning to Nooyorck, will join the
pestilent tribe of Amer-ic-anp-ubl-is-hers; a race more brutal than the
Cherokees, more ferocious than the Iroquois.
IDreadful Complaint.
The prevalent complaint, in the City, is that the Bank is labouring
under a severe tightness across, its money-chest. If something is not
speedily done to relieve the old lady, there is no knowing what the
consequences will be. TRADE and CoMMERCE (who are dependent for
their daily support, and are generally fed by the BANK with a gold and
silver spoon) are completely paralysed for the want of their usual food.
Persons who know their cases the best, declare that TRADE and
CoMMERCE must certainly die of inanition if the BANK does not
immediately give “a little bullion,” or something nourishing, just to
keep them alive.
“touch it, with but a look.”
The man of law was for a moment abashed ; but renewing the
struggle, he had nearly succeeded in carrying off his prize, when the
beadle, knowing the geography of the place,
bounded off towards the western postern,
which he secured by lock and key, his wife
having already taken the hint, and barricaded
the eastern frontier. The result was a parley,
and it ended in the bailiff being obliged to
march out with the honours—and raps on the
knuckles—of war, leaving the beadle sole
master of the field ; upon which, after the
first excitement had passed, he “cried like a
child,” and buried his head in a small basket of
toys, to conceal his emotion.
It is true victory crowned the efforts of the Arcadians ; but the
chaumière had been desecrated; and as the Eastern yellow-hammer never
returns to the nest once looked upon by human eye, the debtor no
longer finds repose in the dwelling that has fallen under the falcon
glance of his creditor. In either case the twig must be for ever
hopped; and such has been the result of the scene we have been
describing. -

THE authorities of the Literary Fund Society are evidently actuated by a fine
spirit of patronage towards literary men, if we are to judge by the manner in which
the representatives of the Press were received at the recent dinner. We find from
the reports—or rather from the non-reports—of the morning journals, that the
gentlemen deputed to attend on behalf of the newspapers were placed at the very
end of the hall, opposite to a continually-opening door, and out of the hearing of
everything. It is certainly very becoming in the managers of a Literary Society to
intimate, as strongly as possible, their opinion that “persons belonging to the Press
ought to be kept at a distance.” It is quite true that the Literary Fund Society is
instituted to pension literature, but not to honour it; and it was therefore considered
perhaps quite allowable to treat the humble individuals belonging to the literary
fraternity with indignity. The poor devils got a dinner; and, what more could they
be justified in looking for *
It seems certainly a little ungracious to treat the Press in this manner, the very year
after the Times journal gave to the fund the handsome donation of a hundred guineas
|—a sum that we think might have purchased some con-
sideration for even the humblest members of the journalist
community. Of course, however, amidst the number of
|Bishops, Right Honourables, and Baronets, whom it
was thought expedient to honour by the best places and
the politest attention, it was impossible to think about a
set of diurnal scribblers, who ought to have been satisfied
with getting a meal where and how they could, without
presuming to look for anything further. If any authors
of eminence were present, we suppose they were left to
|* themselves in at any side-table where there
happened to be a vacant place, for the aristocracy of
birth was, we find, accommodated very extensively,
though we find mention of very few names belonging to
the aristocracy of talent. It is, however, as we have said
already, a charity for literary men, and they have no right
to expect any better treatment on such an occasion than
is awarded to mendicants. Perhaps next year some of the
representatives of the literary class may be called upon
to attend, for the purpose of walking round the room

ledging the subscriptions.
TESTIMONIAL TO CAXTON.
THE REv. H. MILMAN has written a letter to Lord
|Morpeth, proposing the erection of a monument to the
|memory of CAxton ; and his Lordship, like the Captain
in the romance of Billy Taylor, “has werry much applauded
wot he has done.” It is needless to say that we concur
|cordially in Load MoRPETH's approval of the Rev. M.R.
MILMAN's suggestion.
We need not enlarge upon the immense obligations
under which every civilised person lies to Caxton. From
the child with his horn-book to the scholar with his Homer,
from the peasant with his Penny Magazine to the philoso-
sally venerated. The statesman for his statistics, the
politician for his paper, must bless the memory of Caxton.
The little milliner has Caxton to thank for her St. Clair
of the Isles, the school-boy for his Robinson Crusoe, indeed,
to CAxton we owe everything in literature, from Jack
the Giant Killer up to Hamlet; from the poetry of ByRos
down to that of BUNN; from the minstrelsy of Moore to
that of Moses AND Sox.
But of all and sundry who are bounden to the great

the palace to the cottage—the perusal of whose writings is
more than co-extensive with the distribution of the Anglo-
Saxon race.
to his readers (more numerous than farthings in the
national debt) to come forward with their subscription
to CAxton's monument. And thus “like KATTERFElto,
with his hair on end,” wondering at his own wonders,
astonished at his own tremendous circulation, and pro-
portionally grateful for it to the inventor of printing, does
Punch swell the cry for a testimonial to Caxton.

THAT every stone has its sermon,
One SHAKspEARE ventured to tell us;
But e'en bricks and mortar
(Could they find a reporter)
Might make some pulpit-orators jealous.
And, for two famous specimens
Of these brick-and-mortar preachers,
Take School and Prison,
Who’ve lately arisen
As opposition teachers.
Preacher Prison, that frowns so gloomy
On poor society's errors,
Holds the kind of discourse
Whose heavenward force
Springs all from torments and terrors.
Besides that such means are simple,
Efficacious 'tis said you'll find 'em ;
As in Ireland we know,
To make post-horses go,
They clap lighted wisps behind 'em.
So Prison says, “Hark ye, rascals ſ”
(And what sermon can be terser?)
“Just behave as you should—
You'd better be good ;
If you're bad, I'll make you worser?
“That nouns must be, do, or suffer,
Into schoolboys schoolmasters hammer.
You’ve been and done,
So now suffer each one :
That's good sense as well as grammar.”
But Saint School hath a milder aspect,
And preaches a gentler lesson ;
Still making sweet,
To the wayfarer's feet,
The road she would have them press on.
So, as on to stern Preacher Prison
The young congregation journey,
Saint School stops the crowd,
While Prison, aloud,
Invokes Jury, Judge, and Attorney.
“Let them pass to me, old woman—
I preach stern truth: why scotch it?
There's nothing like Law ;
Education—Pshaw 1
Stuff! nonsense ! crazy crotchet !
“Crime listens but to my preaching,
And laughs at thy soft story;
The more thou dost ply,
The fuller am I;
'Tis remarked by SIR PETER LAURIE.”
“Nay, good Preacher Prison,” answered
Saint School, with a gentle patience ;
“Thine ire is hot—
Here's enough, God wot,
For both our congregations.
“Thou art older than I, and richer;
But just consider a minute,
(Ere thou ventur'st to boast,)
That thy chapel, thou know'st,
Had till late all the free-seats in it.
“Want and Ignorance were thy beadles,
(From a time no chronology can date,)
And their goal was thy steeple,
To which all stray young people
Were whipped in by parochial mandate.
“But no mite of aid, till lately,
Have I had from Bench or Beadle ;
Thou couldst bluster and swear
In thy big iron chair,
Whilst poor I must cringe or wheedle.
“And before my face by thousands,
I saw young things, pale and wizen,
Pass stumbling along
The blind paths of wrong,
To sit under Preacher Prison.
“I was helpless and had no patron,
And they passed my door with laughter;
And I sat dismayed,
And I wept and prayed,
Like thee to be followed after.
“But at last I am growing the fashion,
Despite the scoffers and sneerers;
So look to your shop,
For I don't mean to stop
Till 1've drained it of two-thirds your hearers.”

GoDFREY and RAFAEL passed from the street into the outer shop of
the old mansion in Holywell Street. It was a masquerade warehouse,

A medical student was trying one of the doublets of orange-tawney
and silver, slashed with dirty light blue. He was going to a mas-
querade that night. He thought Polly PATTENs would admire him
in the dress–Polly PATTENs, the fairest of maids-of-all-work—the
Borough VENUs, adored by half the youth of GUY's.
“You look like a Prince in it, MR. LINT,” pretty RACHAEL said,
coaxing him with her beady black eyes.
“It is the cheese,” replied MR. LINT ; “it ain't the dress that don't
suit, my rose of Sharon ; it's the figure. Hullo, RAFAEL, is that you,

“There's a sweet pretty brigand's dress you may have for half de

So saying, RAFAEL turned to LoRD CodLINGSBY with the utmost
gravity, and displayed to him the garment about which the young
Medicus was haggling.
“Cheap at the money,” Codlingsby replied ; “if you won't make
up your mind, sir, I should like to engage it myself.” But the thought
that another should appear before Polly PATTENs in that costume was
too much for MR. LINT : he agreed to pay the fifteen shillings for the
garment. And RAFAEL, pocketing the money with perfect simplicity,
said “Dis way, MR. Bhownsh; dere’s someting vill shoot you in the
next shop.”
LoRD Codlingsby followed him, wondering.

FINANCIAL PROPOSITION.
ERHAPs it is not generally known that Punch has
had an interview with the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER, for the purpose of laying before
the Government a proposition to release the
PUNCH*S
ment. Punch was received—of course—very
graciously by the Minister ; and, having been
asked to take a seat in the Cabinet of that
clever official, he proceeded with the statement,
of which the following is an outline :—“There
is,” said Mr. Punch, “I understand, a great
- pressure for money, or, as it is technically
termed, a tightness, though I confess I do not feel it ; I can do very
well without money, if other people would only be satisfied and not
ask me for it. It is true that my tradesmen talk to me of the difficulty
they have in getting in their accounts; but I say to them, very
naturally, What right have you to embark in business at all, if you
have not the requisite capital to bear the brunt of it? Don't talk to
me about settling my little bill; go, sir, and pay your own debts, but
pray don't hother me about matters of this kind, for I have more
important affairs to occupy my attention.”
Mr. Punch here explained to the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequER,
that this part of his observations related only to the general state of
existing circumstances between debtor and creditor, but had no direct
bearing on his great financial proposition. The Minister expressed his
anxiety to come at this as speedily as possible, and the following
dialogue ensued :-
Mr. Punch. Now tell me, in a word, what is the evil for which
you require a remedy ? -
Chancellor of the Exchequer. The fact is, that the circulating
medium is all locked up or out of the country, and we must either
release it or find a substitute.
Mr. Punch. That is exactly my point. Would an unlimited issue
of paper restore the circulation ?
Čhancellor of the Exchequer. Most assuredly it would.
Mr. Punch. Then here you have it. This paper (producing a
number of Punch) has already an unlimited issue, and it is recognised
as a circulating medium all over the world. Now, you have been
talking of putting an interest on Exchequer Bills: do what you will
with them, they will never carry half the interest that attaches to
the paper I now hold in my
hand; and I propose that
a number of Punch, which
is nominally valued at three-
pence, should be declared a
legal tender for one pound
thus you have an issue of
one pound notes at once,

risk of interfering with the

on the receipt of a nominal

which will entitle the appli-

will be kept up a constant

country from its present pecuniary embarrass-
THEORY AND PRACTICE.
EveRY one must approve of the resolution come to by HER MAJESTY,
to practise the most rigid economy in the royal household. There is
something novel in the notion of putting the palace on short commons;
but an example of saving in such a high quarter is of infinite value,
and will have the best effect upon all classes of society. Even the royal
dinner-table is, we believe, set out with a limited number of “breads,”
and the attendants have instructions to prevent even the most illus-
trious of visitors from exceeding the pound, to which each individual is
limited. If LoRD John RussFLL and his Lady should be on a visit to
the QUEEN, a half-quartern loaf would be placed outside the Premier's
door with his shaving-water, and an intimation that the loaf must last
all day would be respectfully given. It was delightful to hear his Lord-
ship, at the recent City dinner to the Ministers, holding forth on the
subject of economy in every article of food ; but unfortunately for the
effect of his eloquence, this particular part of his speech fell side by
side in the report with the bill of fare of the banquet, which was set
forth in the adjoining column. We cannot resist the temptation of
placing the paragraphs to which we allude in juxtaposition, for there
is something very striking in the contrast between what LoRD John
RUSSELL was saying and what he was eating. There is a wondrous
difference between what fell from his mouth and what we may presume
was passing into it.
Look on this picture.”
“I mean that, while on the one hand we
ought to favour as much as possible a free
admission of the greatest quantity of food
into the country, so likewise it is the duty
of every master of a household to economise
as much as possible the food we have.
(Cheers.) While the labouring classes and
the poorer orders of society have the
greatest difficulty in providing for the daily
subsistence of themselves and their families,
it is the duty, I say, of every master of a
household to do what in him lies that that
calamity shall not be aggravated by his own
waste. (Cheers.) And while I state that to
be a general duty, I am happy to say that

kingdom—HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN–has

strawberries, oranges, pears, dried fruits,
Savoy and almond cakes, mixed cakes,
brandy cherries, preserved ginger.
“lces.— Pine, raspberry, strawberry,
orange, millefruit, &c."...-- - -
--
We do not call attention spitefully or ill-naturedly to this little
contradiction, and we give Lord JoHN RUSSELL full credit for the
sincerity of all he said, notwithstanding all he may have eaten; but
the coincidence is rather unfortunate. When a Minister is talking of
the necessity for the utmost economy in the consumption of every
article of food, it is awkward that he should give any one the oppor-
tunity of throwing in his face a lot of “Turkey poults,” “Genvoise
pastry,” “Swiss and Venice merangs,” or enable any ill-disposed person
to stop his economy-preaching mouth with “Plovers' eggs,” “Chantilly
tartlets,” and “Nesselrode puddings.” It must have struck every one
at table, who heard LoRD John Russell's speech, that they had all
been doing very wrong in partaking of so many superfluous luxuries;
but happily the speech came “after dinner” instead of before, and an
alarmed conscience was not permitted to destroy the appetite. We
wonder if LoRD John RUssFLL would have been quite as eloquent on
the subject of abstemiousness before the cloth was removed as he
became afterwards. We suspect his speech would not have been half
so acceptable while the good things enumerated in the bill of fare were
under discussion, as it became when the whole of the dainties had
been disposed of.
We sincerely hope that heads of families will carry out the principle
so properly laid down in the royal household. Let them all look
sharply after the waste and robbery committed by their servants, who
by dishonesty and extravagance give an impetus to the trade...in
marine stores, or put some pet policeman upon an extra diet. With
such a precedent as the Queen most wisely affords, no mistress of a
house need suffer herself to be bullied by her menials out of a rigid
supervision of her household affairs, or from a fear of being called mean,
fail in the moral courage to act with prudence.
- - Exchange NO ROBBERY.
A DAILY paper says “Things on the Exchange are very tight.”
We confess, when we look at the Royal Exchange, that it seems very
TITE–TITE all over. We only wish that the National Gallery and
other buildings about town were equally “right and TITE.”

landlords while attempting to relieve the distress of the whole people.

was framed in a hurry; and as nothing done in a hurry is done well,
nothing ought to be done when an urgent necessity demands it.

AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS–ENGLISH AUTHORS.
MR. PUTNAM, American bookseller, while “passing through England
for New York,” has written a rather affecting letter to the Times on
the matter of American book-stealing. A part of his defence is,
English publishers rob Americans. No doubt they do ; nevertheless,
because a robbery is committed on either side of the Atlantic, the act
is no less a theft. A BARRINGTON in New York is not rendered decent
and respectable by the existence of a BARRINGTON in London. We are,
however, happy to car, on the authority of MR. PUTNAM, that—
“American publishers would prefer to pay English authors;” and,
implies MR. P., they would have done so but for “the unjust and in-
temperate abuse” of English writers, whose hard words have delayed
“an international arrangement.” Thus, call a pirate a pirate, and the
water-rat continues in the wickedness of his ways. Speak him fairly
as the pink of honesty, and the soft flattery makes him a gentleman
complete. Therefore, let us not brand American publishers as the
snappers-up of English volumes; but give them all honour as men
delicately mindful of the property of others, and always insisting upon
money down for its usufruct. Let us henceforth borrow some of
MR. SLIck's “soft sawder :” well applied, it may turn petty larceny
into punctilious probity.
MR. PUTNAM—on his own showing—has done good service for the
honour of the American name. “More than four years ago,” he in-
forms us, he “procured personally the signatures of ninety-seven
American publishers and printers” to a petition for international
copyright:—
“This petition was referred to a Select Committee in both houses of Congress; but
became probable.”
the exciting controversies about Oregon, &c., unfortunately intervened just as success
MR. PUTNAM avows that he has paid English authors a proportion of
the profits of their reprints. We are delighted to make known to our
readers so honourable an exception to the general custom ; and beg to
point to MR. PUTNAM as an example to be followed by “the FAGINs of
letters” (for Mr. Putnam uses, Punch's words) on both sides of the
Atlantic. MR. PUTNAM further declares, that “the American publishers
as a body would prefer to pay English authors for a copyright in their
books.” This is unexpected news.
MR. PUTNAM is about to sail for New York. Fair winds go with
him 1 And when he arrives there, let him perfect the good work
broken by the threatened great guns of Oregon. Let him gather about
him all the American publishers, that they may again petition Congress
to do an act of honesty; whilst at the same time the American
Ambassador in England—himself a distinguished man of letters—shall
be instructed to move the British Government to the like fair dealing.
We think we can promise American authors the fullest and heartiest
co-operation of English writers. For, brethren of America, whilst we
seek to refine and elevate the rest of the world, why should we neglect
—as we have so long neglected—the benighted booksellers ?
An Arch Suggestion.
EveRYBody is inquiring what is the reason of the scaffolding being

that nobody will go to the expense of taking it down ; but we under-

218 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
PUNCH'S REVIEW.
The Post Office Directory for 1847.
THERE is a good deal of pleasant light reading in the pages of this
extensively circulated periodical There can be no doubt that each
annual volume furnishes a vast addition to our stock of modern letters.
There are several works on the same principle as the Post Office
Directory, but we do not know of one that combines, in so convenient a
degree, the delightful peculiarities of business and playfulness. The
mixture of fun and fact is quite extraordinary, and in every page we
find a series of puzzles, which render the work a sort of compre-
hensive collection of “Nuts to Crack,” for the library, the office, and
the counting-house.
As a Christmas book, we know of nothing that we should recommend
so earnestly as we should the Post Office Directory. A Twelfth-night
party might amuse themselves for hours over the riddles contained in
the entertaining volume. Even in its earliest pages the fun begins, for
we find opposite to the name of ADNAM the ingenious piece of per-
plexing hieroglyphic comprehended in the following syllables, “Who.
spiced. old Swan la. Upper Thames St.” Surely there is an hour's
amusement at least to be derived from the attempted solution of this
strange enigma. Who would ever imagine that these fragmentary
exclamations, or whatever else they may be called, are intended to
§ “Wholesale Spice Dealers, Old Swan Lane, Upper Thames
treet.”
In a portion of the work a little further on, we are struck with the
interesting announcement of “Who. Button Wa.,” which causes us to
inquire who does what? and how can buttons have any thing to do
with it 7 An hour or two's industry will, however, reveal the fact,
that “Who. Button Wa.” means nothing more nor less than Wholesale
Button Warehouse.
It will be seen from the specimens we have given, that endless
amusement may be derived from the Post-Office London Directory.
There cannot be the slightest doubt in the world, that any one who
reads it regularly through will rise from the perusal, if not a wiser and
a sadder, at least a puzzleder and mithereder man.
THE QUEEN'S PLATE.
A PRINT-PUBLISHER, whose shop is in an open umbrella in Tottenham
Court Road, writes to say, that it is rather unfair that ALDERMAN
Moon should have the exclusive privilege of soliciting subscriptions
for his engravings in the Royal palaces. A picture of the Royal
Family is exhibited at Buckingham Palace, and the admiring visitor
is gently pulled aside by a gentleman who informs him, very politely,
that “a proof is only £10 10s.-shall he have the pleasure of putting
| your name down?” That attentive gentleman is an agent of ALDERMAN
Moon, and his object is to coax a subscription out of everybody who
enters the palace. The Print-publisher above contends, that if the

like to attend with his umbrella, and he knows several publishers in
the New Cut who would be rejoiced to establish agents in the Royal

illuminated chimney-sweeps. We must say our correspondent writes
as if he were a little jealous of ALDERMAN Moon.
S A CHANCE FOR HIGH ART.
st IR,
“EveRYBoDY complains that High Art is at a discount in this
country. I am a living proof of the fact. I find it quite impossible to
live by ideal creations, and am at this moment (with a heart entirely
devoted to the Umbrian School, and a hand which I am convinced only
wants the fostering aid of a LEo, or a CHIGI, to equal FRA BARTolomeo)
obtaining a precarious support from a portrait club, held at the “Goose
and Gridiron,’ Clare Market. tº º
“Sir, I need not say there is something wrong here. Government
patronage will not set it right. The new House of Lords offers a fine
field; but look at MR. Dyce's fresco. Between ourselves, we must, with
whatever reluctance, confess that it is muffish to the last degree. Now,
sir, I have deeply meditated on this subject. I have read Vasari (in a
translation), Burnet on Effect, Mr. Ruskin's Modern Painters, Lemprière's
Dictionary, Goldsmith's History of England, ditto Greece and Rome, The
studies, aided by an examination of the finest pictures, have, I think,
led me to a discovery which contains the true secret why the old
masters were what they were, and why we remain so far below them.
“The old masters looked at their subjects as realities. Now
realities, i. e. men and women, wear clothes. Accordingly the old
masters painted their personages in the costumes they saw around
them. GUIDo puts Swiss guards at the funeral pile of DIDo, and
REMBRANDT (I believe) paints ABRAHAM as about to dispatch Isaac
with a blunderbuss. The young men in RAFAEL's Marriage of the
Virgin wear Italian dresses of the fifteenth century.
“They thus actualised the ideal, if I may be allowed the expres-
sion, (which a party at the “Goose and Gridiron,’ on Tuesday last,
declared to be “stuff a nonsense’—and this was one of my critics )
because they felt the subject as a reality; and the impress of this
feeling is upon their works. Why should not our painters do the same?
If we can't paint a life-like CAESAR in a toga and paludamentum, (see
Adams's Antiquities,) we may still succeed with one in a tail-coat or
paletot. This is a sketch which I made at our weekly meeting in
illustration of my principle. It was much relished. The subject is the
assassination of JULIUS CAESAR, (see Goldsmith's History of Rome).
“Again, look at the Judgment of Paris, by RUBENs, in our National
Gallery. The ladies are his two wives and a third party, who seems
to have been a common model; and the PARIs is obviously a young
Flemish gent of the seventeenth Century. I would treat the subject
thus:–
Vicar of Wakefield, Gil Blas, and Sir Joshua Reynold's Discourses. These where the realities of the nineteenth century (in which we live)
bring out the notion much more strongly than it could be developed

SHAKSPEARE’S HOUSE.
(conIRIBUTED BY THE oldest INHABITANT.)
“DEAR MR. PUNCH, “Stratford-upon-Avon, May 26.
“Your goodness in printing my last letter has made me bold
to trouble you with a second. I do assure you, sir, that since I appeared
in your pages, I am become very famous in this my native place. Old
as I am, sir, people did not think I had so much printer's ink in me.
And now folks look at my head—bare and shining, sir, as a billiard-
ball—as much as to say, ‘sure there's something more in it that must
go to paper.' And they are right, sir; and here it is.
“Though an old man, sir, I am not given to nurse signs and omens
into points of faith. Nevertheless, sir, when the martlets this year
|
H
failed to mend and take possession of their clay nests under the eaves
of SHAKSPEARE's house, I did, despite of myself, forbode some mis-
chance. I may be wrong ; but I think I have known the birds, from
year to year, down I can hardly count how many generations.
“‘This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here.”
“And SHAKspEARE's martlets—but it's no doubt a fancy, sir–
always seemed to me gentler and prettier than any beside. It is
seventy years and upwards, sir, since I well remember watching 'em
under SHARsPEARE's eaves.
of the little ones opening like opening scissors, and their small white
throats thrust out of their nests to swallow gnats and flies brought
with a thought, and away again, by cock and hen. Well, sir, the
season is past—I have watched and watched—and this spring not a
bird has returned. The nests, cracked by frost and wind, and wet, are
crumbling away, and never a winged mason is there to mend them.
SHAKsp EARE's house is deserted by the martlets, for—I can hardly
write the words—it is, I learn, deserted by men.
“SHAKSPEARE's house—the world's temple, sir—is, as I hear, to be
sold. The owners of that glorious hut are, as I am told, about to turn
it into hard cash, as though it were a stack of firewood. A foreign
| gentleman, as I understand, has offered money for the wondrous
building, to turn it into a show somewhere across the seas. And when
the wonder is past as a show, I further learn that the same gentleman
intends to manufacture the timber into boot-jacks and clothes-pegs.
A London playhousemaster—I forget his name, MUNN or GUNN, or some-
thing like it—has, as I hear, bespoke a horse-trough to be made from
SHARspeARE's roof-tree.
“Well, I confess all these reports—coupled with the keeping away of
the martlets—did at first make my heart sink like a dead thing.
Another minute, and I was all restored ; for I recollected the visit of
my Gracious QUEEN, and amiable Prince, and darling children, to the
house of ShakspeaRE; and I knew—I was sure of it—that the memory
of that house was a sacred thing in the bosom of Gracious Majesty.
SHARsPEARE grew his laurels under an ElizaBETH, and a Victoria
would protect them 1 And I said so ; but—I almost blush for the un-
belief of some people—I was laughed at for so saying.
“Nevertheless, I have heard from a neighbour just come from London
—who would not have his name known—that the QUEEN is so much
pleased with her visit to SHAKspeARE's house, that she has ordered a
picture to be painted of it; and that the picture may be done properly,
the QUEEN has ordered a foreign painter—of the name, I think, of
WINTERHATER—to paint it. The picture, as I am told—but of course,
sir, you know better than I do—will bring in the PRINCE of WALEs in
the QUEEN's lap, signing his name in SHAkspeaRE's birth-room, PRINCE
ALBERT and the two little girls looking on. It must, of course, sir, be
a beautiful thing when done; and I only hope that all the people will be
allowed to see it—they will so love our darling QUEEN for her honour
of SHAKspeARE.
“However, sir, it seems the Peet's house is really to be sold. Now,
as I am informed that your paper—printed in golden letters, they tell
me, and on white satin—is laid upon the QUEEN's breakfast-table, with
camellias, and azalias, and heliotropes, and other beautiful and fragrant
things, every Thursday morning, I humbly write the following lines, in
the fearful hope that they may catch the starry and vouchsafing
eye of condescending Majesty.
“I do, then, humbly propose—to save the nation from a blistering
shame—that the house of SHARspEARE be purchased by the State.—
And further, that there be a poetic guardian, or—as I believe it is called,
custode—of the premises, with a gentlemanly and sufficing in-coming.
His title might be the Poet-Laureate of Stratford ; and, crowned with
poetic wreath—it is a pity that mulberry doth not leaf so early—he
might deliver an ode, or sing a song, as his voice might be, on every
anniversary of SHAKSPEARE's birth-day. This gentleman—in his
own poetic right—s'ould do the honours of SHAKsPEARE's house on
certain ceremonious occasions. For, of course, the Literary Fund (if
I am not wrong in the name) would now and then, after visiting the
house, keep festival in Stratford ; and, no doubt, the SHARspeARE
Society would occasionally take an early train, and hold a solemn
sitting under the roof of SHARspEARE. MR. PAYNE Collie R —
(we have his edition of the Poetin sweet-smelling Russia, also Charles
KNIGHT's, lustrous with pictures, at the Falcon)—would pen a right
merry chronicle of such a gathering. And on these occasions, as I
have said, the custode should be, so to say it, master of the ceremonies.
And this custode I would have some dramatist; and, to begin with,
say MR. SHERIDAN Knowles, a man who hath done good service,
and faithfully earned his future ease.
“And, sir, if the State and the QUEEN be too poor to save the
house of SHAKspEARE ; if they be all too straitened to purchase
the premises, and keep them in due honour, -permit me to suggest the
present as an opportunity well worthy of the attention of the affluent
desirous of compassing a lasting renown, and at the same time
fulfilling a debt of gratitude to him, who hath made all men, of all
nations and all times, his largest creditors. Yours, sir,
“THE OLDEST INHABITANT.”
As a tiny boy, I can remember the bills

TALES OF THE TELEGRAPHS.
THE traveller to Epsom on the Derby-Day
was probably struck by the fitful and fantastic
working of the old-fashioned telegraph on the
old furze-furnished Common of Wimbledon.
Since the adoption of the electric principle, the
occupation of the old original telegraph is gone,
as far as any useful purpose is concerned ; but
the change has had such an effect on the minds
of several of the old workers of these obsolete
machines, that it has been found absolutely
necessary to indulge the poor creatures, by
permitting them to send nonsense messages
backwards and forwards from all the stations
between the Admiralty and Portsmouth. It
was a lamentable thing, on the Derby-Day, to
see the Wimbledon telegraph at work, or rather
at play, in the delivery of a set of incoherent
signals.
We admire the humane spirit in which the
old workers of these perfectly passé concerns
are permitted to continue their former pursuit,
and indulge a sort of garrulity through the
medium of those signals, which are antcipated
like lightning by the principle of elecitricity.
The scene on Wimbledon Common was touching
in the extreme, and reminded us of the affecting
incident of MAsANIELLO singing snatches of his
favourite baccarole after reason had abdicated
its throne, and given place to the establishment
of a thoroughly republican bewilderment in the
brain of the Neapolitan fisherman.
CHEAP PROVISIONS.
A contenTED mind is a continual feast. What
a pity the Irish cannot be made contented 1
QIje QBigtruction in QIñreatmeeble $treet.
YESTERDAY, MRs. BANKE, well known in the City as the “Old Lady
of Threadneedle Street,” came before the LoRD MAYoR to complain of
an obstruction which had been laid at her door by a person of the name
of PEEL. The Court inquired whether she, in return, laid the obstruc-
tion at PEEL's door f The old lady hoped that the Court would not
make fun of her. It was no joke.
The Lord MAYOR asked what was the nature of the obstruction
complained of 2
MRs. BANKB said that it was a heap of rubbish which prevented her
from getting into her cellar. She had upwards of nine millions of
bullion in that cellar, of which she was unable to get at a mite or
morsel; whilst, owing to the badness of the times, she was actually at
her wits' end for a sovereign.
The LoRD MAYok desired to know how long the obstruction com-
plained of had existed 2
MRs. BANKE replied, ever since 1844. The rubbish had been shot
before her cellar-door in that year, and had remained there ever since.
Till lately, she had not so much minded the inconvenience, because she
had only to put her hand in her pocket to answer all calls upon her.
But now her pocket was empty, and she could not get into her cellar.
The LoBD MAYor wished to know the nature of the rubbish, which,
as she alleged, had been shot at her cellar-door by PEEL.
The old lady said it was a parcel of stuff which was called Bank
Charter. The rubbish had been carted at her door by PEEL, at a time
when he was the Government head-carter.
The LoRD MAYok suggested that MRs. BANKE should apply to the
present driver of the Government cart.
MRs. BANKE said that she had done so, but to no purpose. The one
was as bad as the other; there was not a pin to choose between them ;
for what this one said, that one stuck to. She would be glad if his
lordship would order PEEL to take his rubbish away.
The LoRD MAYok regretted, that though he was the sovereign of the
City he was not an absolute monarch : he had no power to remove an
obstruction which was sanctioned by Act of Parliament.
Mas. BANKE said that it was a sin and a shame, when here she was
in trouble and difficulty herself, and with all sorts of people depending
upon her, and going to rack and ruin for want of her help, whereas
she had ample means of relieving them in her cellar. -
The Lord MAYor perfectly agreed with the complainant. He would
try what could be done. MRs. BANKE thanked his lordship, and withdrew.
THE ONE NAME BEFORE THE PUBLIC.
ENNY LIND excites in the public mind
an enthusiasm which now amounts to
actual delirium, interrupted only by
a few lucid intervals, when the atten-
tion is awakened by some very urgent
necessity of life. In pity to her ad-
mirers, she should exert her fascina-
tions less powerfully, for she is begin-
ning to cause people to neglect their
affairs, and leave the most important
business unattended to.
Even in the Money Market, not-
withstanding its tightness, it is com-
montohear JENNY LIND quoted instead
of the rate of Exchange. Those who
want their bills discounted ask you to
cash them notes of JENNY LIND. The
name of LIND is uttered when the
| proper word should have been Consols,
scrip, or Venezuela bonds. It is to be
feared that the “glorious simplicity
of the Three per Cents.” will soon be
: rendered onemass of confusion through
being mixed up with JENNY LIND.
But if the City is wandering on the
subject of JENNY LIND, the West
End, as might be expected, is actually
raving upon it. Ladies at Swan AND EDGAR's, speaking of a new
silk, inquire, What is that JENNY LIND a yard P A gentleman, in
presenting the object of his affections with a bouquet, begs that she
will allow him to offer her a JENNY LIND ; and a rose, it appears, will
not only smell as sweet by this other name, but much sweeter. In the
smoking-rooms at the Clubs, men talk of a prime cigar as a JENNY
LIND, and request the pleasure of a glass of JENNY LIND with you,
or desire you to pass the JENNY LIND this way. At all conversaziones,
her name is mingled with the discussion; and but the other day, a
lecturer at the Royal Institution, forgetting what he was about, said
JENNY LIND when he meant hydrogen.
In short, the Swedish Nightingale has kindled a “blaze of triumph,”
which has produced the general effect of a coup de soleil.

P UNCH*S PRIZE NOWELISTS. |
CODLINGSBY.
By B. DE SEireWs BURY.
WHEN MIRLAM, returning to the mother-of-pearl music-stool, at
a signal from her brother, touched the silver and enamelled keys
of the ivory piano, and began to sing, LoRD CodLINgsby felt as if
he were listening at the gates of Paradise, or were hearing JENNY
LIND.
“LIND is a name of the Hebrew race; so is MENTELsoHN, the Son
of Almonds ; so is RoseNTHAL, the Valley of the Roses; so is Löwe
or LEwis or Lyons or Lion—the beautiful and the brave alike give
cognizances to the ancient people—you Saxons callyourselves BROWN,
or SMITH, or RodgeRs,” RAFAEL observed to his friend; and drawing
the instrument from his pocket, he accompanied his sister, in the most
ravishing manner, on a little gold and jewelled harp of the kind pecu-
liar to his nation.
All the airs which the Hebrew maid selected were written by com-
posers of her race ; it was either a hymn by RossINI, a polacca by
BRAHAM, a delicious romance by SLomax, or a melody by WEBER,
that, thrilling on the strings of the instrument, wakened a harmony on
the fibres of the heart; but she sang no other than the songs of her
“Beautiful one ! sing ever, sing always,” CodLINgsby thought. “I
could sit at thy feet as under a green palm-tree, and fancy that Para-
dise-birds were singing in the boughs.”
RAFAEL read his thoughts. “We have Saxon blood too in our
veins,” he said. “You smile; but it is even so. An ancestress of ours
made a mésalliance in the reign of your KING John. Her name was
REBEccA, daughter of Isaac of York, and she married in Spain,
whither she had fled to the Court of KING BoABDIL, SIR WILFRID of
Ivan Hoe, then a widower by the demise of his first lady RowRNA.
The match was deemed a cruel insult amongst our people; but
WILFRID conformed, and was a Rabbi of some note at the synagogue
at Cordova. We are descended from him lineally. It is the only
blot upon the escutcheon of the MENDozAs.”
As they sate talking together, the music finished, and MIRLAM
having retired (though her song and her beauty were still present to
the soul of the stranger) at a signal from MENDozA, various mes-
sengers from the outer apartments came in to transact business with
him.
First it was MR. AMINADAB, who kissed his foot, and brought
papers to sign. “How is the house in Grosvenor Square, AMINADAB ;
and is your son tired of his yacht yet "MEspoza asked. “That is
my twenty-fourth cashier,” said RAFAEL to CodlingsBY, when the
obsequious clerk went away. “He is fond of display, and all w
people may have what money they like.”
Entered presently the LoRD BAREACREs, on the affair of his mort- |
gage. The LoRD BAREACREs, strutting into the apartment with a |
haughty air, shrank back, nevertheless, with surprise on beholding
the magnificence around him. “Little MoRDEcAI,” said RAFAEL to a
little orange-boy who came in at the heels of the noble, “take this
gentleman out and let him have ten thousand pounds. I can't do
more for you, my lord, than this—I’m busy. Good bye l’” and
| RAFAEL waved his hand to the peer, and fell to smoking his Nargilly.
A man with a square face, cat-like eyes, and a yellow moustache,
came next. He had an hour-glass of a waist, and walked uneasily upon
his high-heeled boots.
“Tell your master that he shall have two
millions more, but not another shilling,” RAFAEL said. “That story
about the five-and-twenty millions of ready money at Cronstadt is all
bosh. They won't believe it in Europe. You understand me, Count
GRogomorESRI ?”
said MENDozA good-naturedly.
“But his Imperial Majesty said four millions, and I shall get the
knowlt unless—”
“Go and speak to MR. SHADRACH, in room Z94, the fourth Court,”
“Leave me at peace, Count ; don't
you see it is Friday, and almost sunset 7” The Calmuck envoy
“The QUEEN must come back from Aranjuez, or that king must be
disposed of.” RAFAEL exclaimed, as a yellow-faced ambassador from
Spain, GENERAL THE DUKE of Olla PodRIDA, left him. “Which
shall it be, my CodlingsBY 7" CodLINGSBY was about laughingly to
answer, for indeed he was amazed to find all the affairs of the world
represented here, and Holywell Street the centre of Europe, when
three knocks of a peculiar nature were heard, and MENDozA, starting
up, said, “Ha! there are only four men in the world who know that
signal.” At once, and with a reverence quite distinct from his former
nonchalant manner, he advanced towards the new comer.
He was an old man—an old man evidently, too, of the Hebrew race
—the light of his eyes was unfathomable—about his mouth there
played an inscrutable smile.
He had a cotton umbrella, and old
trowsers, and old boots, and an old wig, curling at the top like a |
rotten old pear.
He sate down as if tired, in the first seat at hand, as RAFAEL made
him the lowliest reverence.

“I am tired,” says he ; “I have come in fifteen hours. I am ill
at Neuilly,” he added with a grin. “Get me some eau sucrée, and
tell me the news, PRINCE DE MENDozA. These bread rows ; this
unpopularity of GUIzot ; this odious Spanish conspiracy against my
darling MonTPENSIER and daughter; this ferocity of PALMERsTon
against ColeTTI, make me quite ill. Give me your opinion, my dear
duke. But hal whom have we here 7”
The august individual who had spoken, had used the Hebrew
| language to address MENDozA, and the LoRD CodLINGsHy might
easily have pleaded ignorance of that tongue. But he had been at
Cambridge, where all the youth acquire it perfectly.
“Sire,” said he, “I will not disguise from you that I know the
ancient tongue in which you speak. There are probably secrets
between MENDozA and your MAJ–”
“Hush!” said RAFAEL, leading him from the room : “Au recoir, dear

piping bulfinches ; and a Cardinal in disguise, with a proposal for a
new loan for the Pope, were heard by turns, and each, after a rapid
| colloquy in his own language, was dismissed by RAFAEL.
“so is the Pope of Rome; so is * * *”—a whisper concealed the
“Gracious powers 1 is it so 7" said CodlingsBY, musing. He
entered into Holywell Street. The sun was sinking.
“It is time,” said he, “to go and fetch FIFINE to the Olympic.”

MUSINGS ON MUMMY-PAPER.

OH, Shade of MEMNoN 1
CHEops and RAMESEs, shake in your cere-cloths l
Save smoke-dried Pashas of true-Eastern phlegm, none
Can read, unmoved, the end of all your glory,
Announced in the Grand Cairo Spettatore:
How, in the place of mere cloths
Of woollen, linen, cotton,
More or less rotten,
As made at Manchester, and sold by every draper,
They're going to take the bier-cloths
That wrap the sons and daughters of old Nile,
From gilded kings to rough-dressed rank and file,
And turn them into paper 1
We're not told, in the Egyptian Spectator,
What daring speculator
Conceived the notion ; but I'd make a bet he grew
Up to the thought from watching Dr. PETTIGREw,
At some soirée or conversacione,
Midst talk of YoUNG, CHAMPollion, or BELZoni,
And such hieroglyphic twaddle,
Unwinding nimbly, swaddle after swaddle,
The wrappings aromatic
Of some aristocratic
Dandy, of hundred-gated Thebes or Heliopolis,
Consigned to our mushroom of a metropolis
Per last Peninsular and Oriental packet;
And from the hush of his Necropolis–
So deep and drear—
Tumbled ashore, midst the unholy racket
Of the Southampton Pier.
Heaven only knows what acreage of mummy-hood
Is resting in its thousand-year-old dummy hood
Under the desert sands;
Nor what miles upon miles of linen bands
Are rotting in the bosom of the lands
Which MEHMET commands.
But these are times when not e'en mummies
Can longer rest as dummies;
And as the grains of wheat found at their side
Were sown, have grown, and now grow far and wide,
So must old Egypt's gentlemen and ladies,
To the disgust of each old-fashioned ghost,
Give up their cerements to the hand whose trade is
To turn them into Foolscap or Bath-post,
To fly round all creation,
In tongues of every nation,
Spreading (at least we'll hope it) useful information.
But yet, methinks, the venerable sheets
In which have slept, their long, millennial night,
Those who once trod Theban or Memphian streets,
Should not receive the vulgar black and white,
Impressed by common types on common reams;
No mummy-paper should record the dreams
Of those who'd have society rolled back
Into the track
Which the world left five hundred years ago—
The lovers of the stony statu quo—
“Standers in the old ways,” whom nothing stirs,
To whom “the wisdom of our ancestors ”
Is wisdom yesterday, to-day, for ever;
Who, midst a world of change, boast, blind, of changing never.
On mummy-paper a Lord GEorge might find
Fit place for utterance of his “stable mind ;”
On mummy-paper GLADstone should dilate
On old-world theories of Church and State ;
Let mummy-paper bear our penal laws
'Gainst those who hold a different faith or cause ;
On mummy-paper print the outworn story,
And useless Shibboleths of Whig and Tory—
Watch-words that rouse no cry—exploded shams—
“Our glorious Constitution,” and such flams :
In short, print on it (we’ll lend aid most hearty)
A library for next year's “Country Party.”
CAPSICUM HOUSE—FOR YOUNG LADIES."
CHAPTER WI.
MISS GRIFFIN'S SECRET.-The GREY MARE.
Now, could Miss
GRIFFIN have screwed
herself to the Ama-
zonian pitch – could
she have risen to her
own ideal of feminine
firmness—sure we are
she would have sacri-
ficed Miss FLUKE upon
the spot, by denouncing
her as the expelled
one l But for the
milkiness of human
nature seething in the
bosom of the Mistress
of Capsicum, the forlorn Miss FLUKE-with all her boxes l—would
have been sent forth into the wide world, to travel onward to an
obscure grave, a rejected GRIFFIN. This judgment, though deserved
by the offender, was too terrible to be pronounced by the mistress;
who, it may be, thought also of the scandal that might fly-spot the
white fame of Capsicum. And therefore, mingled motives of benignity
and profit made Miss GRIFFIN tolerant of the audacious FLUKE ;
who, by the laughing wilfulness of seventeen, confounded and
governed a spinster of middle age—supposing the usual number of
spinster years to be ninety.
As Miss FLUKE whisked from the room, carried out of it by the
unchecked vigour of her laughter, an infectious gaiety fell upon the
remainder nineteen young ladies. Mirth ran from face to face,
like a line of sudden light. Eyes, black and blue, were dissolving
with the fun that shone within them ; and lips put themselves into all
shapes and contrivances to repress the laughter that—like heart-
delighting wine—gently whizzed and oozed at the corners, ready to
burst in sparkling foam for man's sweet intoxication. Nineteen pair
of lips, some in little red lumps, some growing redder beneath the
biting pearl, some tightly pressed, some involving one another, and all
vainly trying to imprison and slay the god of mirth, that, engendered
in the heart, at length burst forth upon the air with a silvery shout.
And Miss GRIFFIN, for the first time, knew she had a secret, at the
moment she felt it was discovered. Those nineteen melodious voices
were so many accusing spirits, taking all shapes and sounds. Now
they tinkled in her ears like a chain of wedding-rings ; and now,
like the softest and most honied notes of a church organ, they accom-
panied the hymeneal cherubim—all heads and voices—chanting
“I WILL :"
In that prophetic flash did Miss GRIFFIN see MR. TAMERLANE
CoRRs in a new blue coat and white watered satin waistcoat. (She
saw no more). He held the ring ; and she felt a cold shiver run
to the root of her third finger. Corks smiled and—to her thought—

valentine. In that lightening moment Miss GRIFFIN felt her marriage
minute was come ! All things sympathised with the time. The
pigeons without cooed loudly down the chimney; the orange-buds
no doubt broke in the conservatory; and, in the garden, as singeth
PLANCHE, the lyrist—
“The lily of the valley rang her peal of silver bells.”
And all this, credulous reader, all this came into the mind of Miss
GRIFFIN, struck there by the leading laugh of Miss FLUKE, conscien-
tiously followed by all her nineteen schoolfellows.
But Miss GRIFFIN–shaking her feelings as partlet shakes her
rumpled feathers—became calm, solemnly calm. “The Marriage-
Class is dismissed,” she said, with a stern serenity; as though with
the words she turned away HYMEN from her own heart, like an impor-
tunate linkman whose services were by no means required. “The
Marriage-Class is dismissed,” she repeated ; and the young ladies,
demurely as kittens bent on mischief, walked as with velvet feet from
the room, every one of them carrying about her lips the beginning of
another laugh, to be duly finished up stairs.
“What will become cf. that Miss FLUKE,” said the GRIFFIN, still
avoiding the eye of CoRks, as though it were a bullet, “who can
tell ?—It is not pleasant to ruin a young lady for life—
“No,” said the sepulchral Corks.
“Otherwise,” continued the Governess, “I would send her with
a penny-post letter home. However, I am afraid that, go when she
will from this house, she will never leave it with the grey mare.”
“The grey mare 1” we cried. “What of the grey mare 7"
“Oh, a symbol—merely a symbol,” answered Miss GRIFFIN. We
gracefully pressed for an explanation. “Well, then, you must under-
stand,” said the Governess, “that when a young lady, fitted with all
the acquirements of a wife and a housekeeper—a young lady, educated
at Capsicum House, to guide her husband as MINERVA guides her
peacock, with reins unfelt, unseen—mere reins of moonshine,”—
“Sunshine,” we suggested, as an improved material for conjugal
harness.
“Say sunshine,” consented Miss GRIFFIN. “When she quits
this place, duly furnished for the altar, the dining-room and the pantry,
she is always taken to her home by the grey mare. When married—
if she remain a true Capsicum, and I am proud to say I have
known but few backsliders, when married, sir, she is carried to the
home of her husband by four grey mares. For in a grey mare, sir, –
you shall by-and-bye see our own darling in the paddock—in a grey
mare, as you ought to know, there is a proverb and a symbol.”
We bowed to the existence of the proverb.; and then—for we
marked that Miss GRIFFIN desired to talk—and then we observed,
“The saying is very ancient. Yes; the grey mare is old—doubtless
very old 7”
“I am assured, sir, by Doctor PUMPUs,” answered Miss GRIFFIN,
“that she came out of NoAH's ark with NoAH's wife and NoAH's
sons' wives.”
“No doubt of it,” sounded Corks. “I have somewhere read that
the Amazons—we have few such women now,” and Corks looked at
Miss GRIFFIN–“the Amazons always strung their bows from a grey
mare; and I believe it is not saying too much of those distinguished
ladies to assert, that their arrow never missed their man, and their bow
never wanted a string. Happy women l’”
“The world was worth living in then,” said Miss GRIFFIN with a
sigh.
“It is for you, madam,” said CoRks, “to roll back that world. As
for the Grey Mare, her history—I mean her domestic history—is yet
to be developed. I have no doubt she is a-a myth—” finished
CoRks, looking somewhat appealingly for an explanation of the syllable
he had ventured.
“It has just struck me, MR. CoRks, that as we have the Order of
the Sheep, the Order of the Elephant—if I am right,” ventured Mrss
GRIFFIN, “the Order of the Lion, and the Order of the Bear (an
excellent Order), for men, that it would be an admirable institution,
to have the Order of the Grey Mare, for women.”
“Splen—did l’ shouted Corks. “Why not found the Order your-
self, dearest madam, and hold your first chapter—if I am not wrong—
here in Capsicum House?”
“I almost feel it is my mission,” said Miss GRIFFIN. “Neverthe-
less, society is hardly ripe for it. To be sure, until the proper time
shall come, the sisterhood might be one of secrecy. Every wife found
worthy of the Order of the Grey Mare need not show it.”
“At least, not before company,” we ventured to remark.
And then Miss GRIFFIN shook her head and cried—“My dear sir,
on second thoughts, only think of the temptation 1"
looked like Cupid as a bird-catcher, the picture of her earliest “Very true,” we
answered ; “no : it is not to be expected. 'Twould
be like wearing diamonds under a nightcap.”
“MR. Corks l’exclaimed Miss GRIFFIN, as though she looked to
him for protection ; and then, with cold composure, she said, “if you
please, as we are upon the subject, and the school is up for the day,
we will walk to the paddock.”
MR. Conks, bending his arm like the bow of CUPID, offered it to
Miss GRIFFIN, who just laid her five fingers on the proffered limb, as
though playfully afraid of it. |
We descended into the garden, and turning zig-zag right and left,
came into the poultry-yard. Suddenly Miss GRIFFIN stopped, and
pointing to a gander that stood motionless beside a small, low shed,
observed, “Look there ! The goose has been four weeks last Tuesday
on her eggs; and except to eat a bit, and now and then to wash him-
self, that faithful bird, her mate, has never left that spot.”
CoRKs moved his head up and down in solemn admiration ;
and then, with his searching eye upon the gander, slowly remarked,
|
|
|
|
“Philoprogenitiveness very large.”
Feeling that some word was required of us, we said, “Such tender-
ness in an irrational creature, madam, is a touching sight.”
“Oh, sir,” cried Miss GRIFFIN, and pathetically, too, “Oh, sir,
when I sometimes read the newspapers, and think of the faithfulness
of the birds of the air, I confess it, I blush for a part of my species.”
“It is very kind of you, Miss GRIFFIN,” said we.
“Not but what I sometimes think we wrong poor animals. Now,
geese, MR. Corks,”—and suddenly the Professor of Intonation looked
quite alive to the subject—“I think geese very much slandered. I
am convinced of it, geese have great judgment.”
“Well, madam, I must say it—my experience as an actor cannot
wholly deny it,” and CoRks feebly sailed. |
“And do the young ladies,” we inquired, “pursue their studies
here 7 Have you a Poultry-Class 7” |
“Most certainly,” answered Miss GRIFFIN, as she walked on.
“How defective is the education of a woman who cannot detect a
chicken from a maternal hen; a duckling from the grandmother of
ducks ; a young stubble goose from a goose grown grey with years 1
Reflect, sir, for a moment on the domestic acerbity likely to be occa-
sioned by old poultry brought to table. I have known, sir, men
of the best tempers—with tough poultry to carve—turned into
demons. Now here, sir, the pullet is watched, I may say, from the
egg to the spit; and thus the serenity of the future husband is
unruffled by drum-sticks. But here,” said Miss GRIFFIN, “here is
the paddock with the Grey Mare.”
3iegal Intelligence.
It may be as well that the Profession should be made acquainted
with the state of the engagements of our learned friend MR. BRIEFLEss,
who, amongst his numerous retainers, finds none so agreeable as the
pleasant recollection he always retains of the confidence of his clients.
We find in our forensic friend's list of business for the Term, the follow-
ing important items :-
1. Case for opinion. This is an interesting case of excellent Cham-
pagne, of which his opinion is desired at his earliest convenience.
2. Draft to settle. This is a pipe of admirable draft Cyder, which
has been left with MR. BRIEFLEss to settle before the long vacation.
3. Bill with instructions to draw. This turns out to be an accom-
modation bill, which a friend has instructed the learned gentleman to
draw ; but MR. BRIEFLEss, with becoming caution, has declined enter-
ing into the transaction.
|
Besides the above list, there is in our learned friend's chambers a
case of DoE on the demise of Roe, which turns out to be a preserved
Mackarel with bread-stuffing, and which, we believe, he intends
leaving over altogether as a remanet. We find nothing in the
peremptory paper way but a letter from the learned gentleman's
tailor, which will take him to Court on the first opportunity.

AMong the earliest exhibitions of the present season, that of the Bill
Stickers stands exceedingly high, and is replete with a truly charming
variety. The pictorial placard has opened out quite a new style of
art, and we shall not be surprised to find some of the first painters of
the age devoting their genius to the composition of broadsides. One of
the earliest efforts in this direction was the celebrated “Ha 1 ha I
Cured in an instant ' " which will be found in the collection of Pro-
FEssoR HollowAY, who was certainly a greater Professor—looking at
his Professions—than any of his contemporaries. It will be remem-
bered that his ointment was warranted to pull out teeth, extract corns,
demolish bunions, remove baldness, get rid of gout, produce whiskers,
cure indigestion, give an appetite, take away freckles, soften the hands,
prolong life, arch the eyebrows, support the knees, eradicate chaps
from the ilips, and promote activity in the muscles.

| continually sending up to the Professor the details of some astonishing
cure, which has been produced by the marvellous ointment.
| The EARL of ALDBoRough must be a wonderful man to have gone
through so many dangers, and the wonderful ointment is worthy of the
noble who appears to live upon it. We cannot deny to the Professor
the credit of having been one of the first to associate the fine arts with
advertising hand-bills, and thus to lay the foundation for those exhi-
bitions of puffing pictures which give new life to all the dead walls in
and about the metropolis.
The present season is exceedingly rich in these pictorial embellish-
ments, and the exterior of the old Fleet Prison offers just now a very
powerful counter-attraction to those exhibitions which are
open, or are on the point of opening. We think it would be worth the
while of some enterprising publisher to print a daily catalogue of the
| wall of the Fleet, for the convenience and instruction of amateurs and
the public in general.
THE CAXTON MONUMENT.
Doctor MILMAN has received the subjoined letter from Wiscount
MoRPETH. It will be remembered that, on a late occasion, HER MA-
JESTY's Ministers declined to interfere in the matter of the preservation
of the house of SHAKSPEARE. Possibly, they were influenced in their
determination by the Court Circular, that chronicles so many royal
visits to the Italian Opera and the French Plays, but rarely one to an
English theatre. SHAKSPEARE being considered a bore at Court, is
scarcely to be respected by the Cabinet. We are sure that LoRD
MoRPETH must have felt a twinge as he penned the subjoined :—
“MY DEAR Doctor MILMAN,+All that you have written about a
monument to CAxton is charming—very charming, indeed. The idea
is truly that of a poet. A fountain by day, and a jet of light by night !
Thirst assuaged, and darkness conquered Extremely pertinent this ;
and very typical of the art of the printer, as developed in the publi-
cation of the morning and evening papers. Nevertheless, HER MA-
JEsty's Government considers that the fame of CAxton is more the
general property of the nation than of the Ministry; who, indeed,
violate a standing order of Parliament when they suffer the printer to
enter either the Lords or Commons. And then, for the proposed
fountain and light, permit me to observe that the locality you have
suggested for the CAxton monument is, I am given to understand on
the very best authority, already blest with a pump and gas. These
the exercise of a moderate degree of popular imagination may easily
regard as the Fountain and Light you propose—and the expense of the
monument be saved. Besides, when we have to lay out so much money
upon Buckingham Palace, how can we-in these hard times—spare a
shilling for the monument of a man, whose art, by the way, has not
always been a matter of comfort or admiration to the sovereigns of
England 7
“I remain, my dear Doctor MILMAN,
“Your's faithfully,
“MoRPETH.”
“P.S. Should the monument arise from private funds, I shall feel
myself honoured by being placed among the subscribers.”
classical 33antomime Quartetteg.
A DELIGHTFUL series of Pantomime Quartettes has recently been
commenced by four of our first executants in that most captivating
branch of art, and we hope to see the experiment perfectly successful.
These charming unions have originated in the taste and genius of the
veteran SouthBY, who conceived the happy idea of holding meetings for
the effective rendering of some of those exquisite pantomimic morceaux
that have been bequeathed to us by the great GRIMALDI and other old
masters. The programme for last Monday was exceedingly attractive,
and comprised the delicious wheelbarrow movement, Op. 926, together
with “Tippitywitchet,” and a variety of other favourite compositions.
The wheelbarrow movement created the most intense interest among the
numerous dilettanti and virtuosi who thronged the room. SouthBY's
firmness and breadth give a steadiness and body which are essential to
the perfect rendering of this great work of art, and his grasp of his
subject was splendidly displayed in the handling of the wood which
forms the wheel of the wheelbarrow. Howell made an admirable
little more to do than support South Br, the hand of the master was
apparent in every movement. “Tippitywitchet” gave MATHEws
an opportunity of coming forward more independently in the solo hits,
where his scholarship came out with great freshness and force ; while
the tuttis at the end of each verse enabled every executant to display
some peculiarity for which he is illustrious. In the sneeze, the free-
dom and finish of MATHEws told exceedingly well; while he never
allowed his gushing buoyancy to go beyond that delicate nicety which
marks the true artist. Howell did efficient service in the yawn, and
carried his audience with him in a most astonishing manner. "
The dilettanti expressed the most unmeasured delight at the whole
pantomimic unions. We understand that “Hot Codlings” is the next
great work the executants will take in hand, but they do not mean to
present it to the virtuosi until it can be given in that state of perfection
which is due to a composition of such rare magnitude.

LOVE-SONGS OF THE FAT CCNTRIBUTOR.
THE GHAZUL, OR ORIENTAL LOVE-SONG.
YRICAL composition of
almost every kind
has been tried by our
F. F., and it cannot
be supposed that he
should have practised
so much without es-
saying the Oriental
style of verse. Here
are three specimens
of his Eastern poems,
from a large collection
called by their gifted
author, “Draughts
of Sherbet.”
| \
||||| - -
TSN N
His own account of the verses is as follows :-
1. THE Rocks. This song is anterior to the times of Antar, and almost as
popular among the tribes of the Lebanon as any chronicle of the indomitable
lover of Ibla. I learned it in the Seven Towers, Constantinople, from young
BUKsheesh BEY, a prisoner there along with his uncle, the ill-fated EMEER
BESHEER. Sung to a guzla, and to a wild and plaintive air, the Antelope never
failed to bring tears into the eyes of the Emeer's attendants. I regret not
having noted the music.
2. THE MERRY BARD is the celebrated or rather notorious little KARA
GURoo, the cobbler, philosopher and bell-ringer at the mosque of SULTAN
AcHMET. His mots are repeated all over Constantinople, and he is to be found
at the Greek wine-houses, pretty regularly of an evening, with a dulcimer and
a jar of wine beside him, tippling and singing verses of an epicurean and
amatory tendency. “The Little Brown Bulbul" is the name by which he is
known in his quarter, where I was introduced to him by another delightful
poet—I mean M. DE TITof F, of the Russian Embassy.
3. THE CAICJKEE. This is a favourite song of His Highness ABD-UL-
MEDJEED. I composed it (in the Turkish language, with which I am pretty
familiar) on a melancholy occasion, of which I forbear to speak. The fate of
the LEILAH of the song is well known. The REVEREND G–E BR-N, of the
American Mission at Pera, has in his possession the sack in which the lovely
and unfortunate Georgian girl was found floating in the Bosphorus. I have
never been the same man since.
Such is our friend's explanation; not one word of which, it gives us great
pain to say, do we believe.
The ROCKS.
I was a timid little antelope;
My home was in the rocks, the lonely rocks.
I saw the hunters scouring on the plain;
I lived among the rocks, the lonely rocks.
I was a-thirsty in the summer-heat;
I ventured to the tents beneath the rocks.
ZULEIRAH brought me water from the well ;
Since then I have been faithless to the rocks.
I saw her face reflected in the well ;
Her camels since have marched into the rocks,
I look to see her image in the well ;
I only see my eyes, my own sad eyes.
My mother is alone among the rocks.
THE MERRY BARD.
ZULEIRAH ! The young Agas in the bazaar are slim-waisted and wear
| yellow slippers. I am old and hideous. One of my eyes is out, and the hairs
of my beard are mostly grey. Praise be to Allah 1 I am a merry bard.
There is a bird upon the terrace of the Emir's chief wife. Praise be to
Allah!. He has emeralds on his neck, and a ruby tail. I am a merry bard.
He deafens me with his diabolical screaming.
There is a little brown bird in the basket-maker's cage. Praise be to Allah!
He ravishes my soul in the moonlight. I am a merry bard.
The peacock is an Aga, but the little bird is a Bulbul.
| Am a little brown Bulbul. Come and listen in the moonlight. Praise be to
Allah! I am a merry bard.
THE CAIQUE.
Yonder to the kiosk, beside the creek,
Paddle the swift caique.
Thou brawny oarsman with the sun-burnt cheek,
Quick 1 for it soothes my heart to hear the Bulbul speak
Ferry me quickly to the Asian shores,
Swift bending to your oars.
Beneath the melancholy sycamores,
Hark! what a ravishing note the love-lorn Bulbul pours.
Behold, the boughs seem quivering with delight,
The stars themselves more bright,
As mid the waving branches out of sight
The Lover of the Rose sits singing through the night.
Under the boughs I sat and listened still,
I could not have my fill.
“How comes,” I said, “such music to his bill ?
Tell me for whom he sings so beautiful a trill.”
|
|
|
“Once I was dumb,” then did the Bird disclose, |
“But looked upon the Rose ;
And in the garden where the loved-one grows,
I straightway did begin sweet music to compose.”
|
|
|
“O bird of song, there's one in this caique
The Rose would also seek,
So he might learn like you to love and speak.”
Then answered me the bird of dusky beak,
“The Rose, the Rose of Love blushes on LEILAH's cheek.”
MULTUM IN PARVO.
AMong the novelties in dress that ingenuity has lately
brought forth, is a garment consisting of collar, cravat, shirt-
front, and waistcoat, all in one. It is said to be “a saving
of time, money, and material, in dress;” but this is an
economy that can be just as well achieved with an ordinary
waistcoat, by buttoning it closely up, and omitting all the
other articles by which it is usually accompanied. We have
known several ingenious gentlemen who have anticipated the
inventor of the costume described, by making one item of
dress do the duty of half-a-dozen. In this way we have
known a boot serve the additional purpose of a stocking ; and
other portions of costume have been put upon double or treble
duty, in the manner we have hinted at.

ATTORNEYS." GOWNS.
HE attorneys are getting up an agitation in favour
of their wearing a gown; and the great Bom-
bazine Question is likely to become a leading
topic with the legal fraternity. An antiquarian
member of the craft has discovered that the
gown was formerly a part of the attorney's
costume, and there is a loud cry for its resump-
tion. The reasons by which this movement
is supported are now before us in a printed
circular.
“1st, That, on being sworn attorneys, they are invested
with it as a distinguishing garb and characteristic of the
profession.”
There is not much in reason number one;
for it does not follow that because a piece of
masquerading mummery marks the initiation
of an attorney into his professional career, he
is to keep up the tom-foolery to the end of his
practice.
“2ndly, That it is the simple and efficient means of avoiding the inconvenience of
obtaining admission into crowded courts of justice, &c.”
If their wish is only to make their way easily through a crowd, a
harlequin's dress would be the most fitting costume we could recom-
mend to them. But it is absurd to suppose that an attorney requires
anything of the kind to enable him to force his way, for most of the
class are such pushing fellows, that the difficulty is to keep them out
instead of facilitating their entrance. -
“3rdly, When admitted to the body of the court, of obtaining access to counsel and
retaining possession of the seats appropriated to attorneys, a matter which every
attorney knows is now often an impossibility, the seats being usually crowded at the
opening of the courts by the idle and curious, in consequence of which, the attorney
is often obliged to ſting his brief to counsel, without an opportunity of making any of
or criminal,) which his detailed knowledge would render so useful and convenient to the
advocate.”
We certainly sympathise more with the counsel who have the briefs
flung at them, than with the attorneys who complain that they are
put to the trouble of flinging. It is perhaps rather objectionable that
every attorney should have his fling in court; but if it is the only
way of throwing out a suggestion, it is an inconvenience that we
must learn to tolerate.
“And lastly, That it would give a professional character, and attach respect, by raising
the respectability of our order in the eyes of the public. The barrister does not forsake
his wig and gown; why should the attorney relinquish the outward and visible sign of
his belonging to the same learned profession?”
This last reason is the one which seems after all to be the most
plausible. Still it is one that cannot stand; for if an attorney relies
upon a gown to give him a professional character, he will not find it
wear to his satisfaction. The respectable practitioner is, “when un-
adorn'd, adorn'd the most ;” but as to the scamp—
“You may gown, you may toga the Gent. as you will,
But the pettifog odour will stick to him still.”
It is true enough that the barrister does not forsake his wig and
affection, and long separation must have so accustomed him to the
change, that a re-union would only be awkward and embarrassing.
The circular now before us, after commencing with all the pretension
of an appeal to professional dignity, sinks down, towards the end, into
a regular begging letter. The following paragraph is full of purpose:—
“As this course is necessarily attended with expenses in printing, postages, &c., it is
proposed to defray it by a subscription, not exceeding 5s. each, which may be forwarded
to me in penny postage stamps.”
The moderation and delicacy with which the subscription is limited
thus imposed will act, we dare say, as a most wholesome check on
exuberant generosity. The farce of “Lend me Five Shillings” cannot
be richer than this little incident of the application for that sum in
postage stamps. The following concluding paragraph of the epistle
from which we have been quoting, is rather more curious than
satisfactory.
“Should the list of adherents appear sufficiently numerous, counsel will bring the
subject before the Judges of the superior courts, or such other |...}º will be
taken to carry the plan generally into execution as may be deemed advisable.”
If there are enough adherents—if a sufficient number should hang
on by the gown of the attorneys—the subject will perhaps be brought
before the courts, and the five shillings will be applied for the benefit
of the subscribers. If the great body of attorneys should think the
gown all stuff, what is to become of the enormous accumulation of
Echo-or its substitute—answers, “You had better make your inquiries
of the parties concerned, for I can give you no information.”
RICHARDSON'S GHOST'S COMPLAINT.
(Picked up at Greenwich Fair.)
Forced from home and all its pleasures,
London town I left forlorn :
To increase a showman's treasures,
In a jolting waggon borne.
Men with whiting came and chalked me,
Round me did a sheet enfold :
Into playing ghosts they talked me—
Oh, how sadly I was sold!
Still in thought as free as ever,
Who has got the right, I ask,
Me from better parts to sever ?
Acting ghosts my daily task."
Cotton night-caps, chalk complexion,
Cannot forfeit talent's claim ;
Dress may differ, but reflection
Tells me Genius is the same.
Why did melodrama writers
Make the parts in which I toil 7
Of my hopes they are the blighters:
Any acting they would spoil.
Think ye, authors, leaden-headed,
Writing for the showman's boards,
How much genius lies embedded,
In the Ghost your pen affords.
By my energies all wasted,
In a tablecloth and chain ;
By the chalk that I have tasted,
Pouring down my cheeks like rain;
By my sufferings since ye brought me
Down to this degrading part,
But sustained because it taught me
Something of the actor's art ;
Let me play the ghosts no longer
Than a substitute ye find ;
Give me business rather stronger,
Business that gives scope for mind.
Managers, whose sordid dealings
Tarnish all your noble boasts,
Just consider people's feelings,
Ere you make them play the ghosts.
'Musical Arrangements.
HERR Schwartz is in town for the season, with his celebrated brass
band, and purposes taking a series of musical excursions to Rosherville
and other parts during the summer weather. He has just finished
the Limehouse Quadrilles, which he will play on board the Red Rover
to Herne Bay, in a few days ; and he has arranged a series of passages,
ascending and descending, to harmonise with the alternate going up
and down of the vessel. HERR Schwartz is also busy upon the
Blackwall Polka, and White Bait Waltz, which will be played, for the
first time, on the 15th of July, in commemoration of the taking of
Rosherville.

A QUARTER of an ounce of sugar of lead was lately found in a bottle

fearful results that any peruser of “all the new works” must have
long ago discovered.

THE RUINS OF REGENT STREET ARCADE.
WHAT would GeoRGE THE FourTH say if he could see at present
It has scarcely a roof to its head. The
rain pours in upon it from a thousand holes; the winds whistle through
the broken skylights; the lath and plaster hang from the ragged
ceiling in dreary festoons of wretchedness ; and the mortar repeatedly
comes down in a pelting shower, which makes the stoutest umbrella
tremble under it. There is a Chancery look about the place ; the
pillars seem of the I.O.U. order of architecture ; litigation and the dry
rot are evidently doing their best to undermine the haughty Arcade
and reduce it into a state of premature decay. In a few months more,
unless the holes are filled up—for a hole in time may save nine—the
entire colonnade must inevitably tumble from its proud estate, and
the ruins will be numbered with those of Nineveh and Carthage.

back with regret to those days when carriages loved to bask in the
sun of the fashionable highway, and silk-stockinged footmen delighted
to repose in the peaceful shades of the Arcade. The sun bakes the
pavement; and the rural seats outside HoweLL AND JAMEs's, where
John met THOMAs in friendly intercourse, and exchanged the secrets of
each others' pantry, are deserted for the feverish benches of the nearest
public. And the carriages—where are they 2 They are disporting

Arcade. He will agree with us, that there is not in the whole collec-
tion of “Nash's Exteriors” a roof which could have more fretting about
it than the one which is allowed to be shamefully suspended by a
solitary hog's-bristle, as it were, over the devoted beadle's head. To
prevent accidents, we really think a board ought to be put up marked
“Dangerous,” or a whisp cf straw suspended at each entrance, with the
warning “No thoroughfare.”
Peel's Coming 1
THE Morning Herald has read a terrible warning to all Peeresses
with sons. If the affectionate mothers would preserve their children
from a political ogre, they are to beware of the ex-Premier. For—asks
the Herald, in a passion of grief—for “what hope have youth and
amiability in the unscrupulous hands of SIR Robert PEEL 7" This
feeling is now so generally acknowledged, that at Harrow and Eton
the masters, when they would send the naughty boys to bed, have only
to exclaim—“PEEL's coming !” and the thing's done.

PUNCH'S ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
OUR advices from Oxford are somewhat ambiguous; our local
correspondent in that quarter sends us facts to the 28th ultimo, and
jokes to the 31st, from the latest of which we make a selection. The
name of MR. Round, one of the candidates, has put us in possession
of puns, one of which has just arrived by electric telegraph. We
need not say that we have been severely shocked, but whether by the
wit or the wires, we have not yet been able to determine. The follow-
|ing are the particulars :—
“The chairman of MR. Round's Committee has been trying to set
him square with the electors; but the general impression is, that the
attempt will not end in a successful quadrature of the circle.”
We understand that MR. Round's Committee instantly met for the
purpose of getting up an opposition pun upon the name of MR.
CARDWELL ; but though several rumours are afloat, no joke has been
set forth with the weight of official acknowledgment. A vague
allusion to “playing his Card-well,” and not being “a trump card,”
was in circulation for a short time ; but an indignant disclaimer has
since been put forth by an influential member of MR. Round's
Committee. It is understood that if the election seems likely to
depend ultimately on a play upon words, an experienced punster will
be offered a thousand guineas to come down from London expressly to
pun MR. CARDwell completely out of the field, which the much-
respected wag to whom we allude, has undertaken to accomplish, if
his services should be required.
Our correspondent at Aberdeen writes to us, entreating us to send
down a candidate to oppose MR. BANNERMAN ; for, that any one knowing
how to work the point about fighting under the standard of Freedom
instead of the humiliating banner of BANNERMAN, would be sure of an
enthusiastic reception among the electors. It certainly seems a pity
that a subject so suggestive of electioneering squibs should be lost for
want of an opposition.
In Greenock, LoRD JoHN HAY's friends have been canvassing, not-
withstanding the extreme heat of the weather, and they have secured
several votes by ask-
ing the electors to
make Hay while the
sun shines.
In Bristol, the HoN.
T. H. BERKELEY is
opposed by MR. FRIPP.
We need not say that
placards, with No FRIP-
PERY upon them, are
now covering the walls
of the city.
At Bath, MR. Roe-
Buck has been under-
going a severe cross-
questioning from his
constituents. They
complain of his ex-
ceeding bitterness, and
his very bad taste ;
on account of which
some of the electors
declare they can no
longer swallow him.
In Westminster, the
Wandering Minstrel
has had pretty broad
hints that he had
better “move on ; ”
for wherever he strikes
up, he is regarded as
a nuisance by the
electors.
Coming to a Proper Conclusion.
TheRE was a paragraph at the conclusion of the KING OF PRUssLA's
speech at the opening of the Diet which has been omitted, somehow, in
all the published reports. The paragraph runs as follows:– “My
brave spirits of Fatherland, you have my speech. ... I beg of you now
to put it in your much-to-be-admired-and-beautifully-coloured pipes,
and to smoke it.” The Germans are proverbially slow, but we believe
that a great number of them have already come to the above conclu-
sion. But the speech is so dry that it takes them a long time to get
through it.

REJOICINGS IN HONOUR OF THE QUEEN'S BIRTH-DAY.
FROM an early hour in the morning the inhabitants of London
were enlivened by a constant ringing of bells, whose merry peals pre-
vented them from hearing a word that was spoken; and as, in the
present “tightness,” no very agreeable conversation is to be had, the
effect was altogether very delightful. The firing of the guns supplied
a most acceptable boon to the riders in omnibuses, for by startling the
horses, the constant discharges of artillery accelerated the speed of the
animals, who might otherwise have fallen, from the heat of the weather,
into a pace of uncomfortable sluggishness. -
Therejoicings in the metropolitan eating-houses were on the usual scale
of festive liberality. The various joints were observed to be in excellent
“cut” up to a late hour of the day, and several parties took advantage
of the opportunity thus afforded them of assisting at the rejoicings on
the occasion of her Majesty's Birth-day. . In the evening the hilarity
was kept up by the illuminations provided at the expense of the
clubs and tradesmen of the metropolis, whose liberality seemed to give
general satisfaction to every one but the moon, who was visibly affected
by the superior brilliance that surrounded her.

THE GOVERNMENT SHIPS.
THE extraordinary freaks of the ships built for the government,
have been exciting the most serious attention, for every man-of-war
goes rolling about the ocean in a state of top-heaviness that is regarded
with alarm by all who are anxious to maintain our naval supremacy.
The extreme weight of the guns has caused such a determination of
lead to the head, that unless something can be done to relieve the
overcharged vessels, a sort of apoplexy among the ships will become
general. Several of them have been already suffering under a sort of
paralytic attack, which deprives them of the use of their sides, and all
the support that can be given by the aid of stays has been found
ineffectual
We believe that a sort of cold-water cure has been seriously recom-
mended, which it is proposed to put in force by constructing some
ships on the principle of the common sieve, permitting a current of
water to flow continually in, and thus steady the ship by the introduction
of a sort of aquatic ballast. The only objection to this is, that when
you let in any water at all, you cannot exactly say where it will stop ;
but it is proposed to obviate this difficulty by attaching balloons to
the masts, which, it is thought, will effectually prevent any vessel from
sinking. We hope the plans hinted at will, at all events, be tried, for
they cannot prove greater failures than those which have been already
put in practice.
SUBSTITUTE FOR THE TREADMILL.
THE Times informs us that at a meeting of Middlesex Magistrates,
the other day, a motion was made by MR. Rotch, “That it be referred
to a committee to consider whether some better system of hard labour
cannot be substituted for the treadwheel in the prisons of the County of
Middlesex.”— A better species of hard labour than the treadwheel
i would be the task of making out a modern Act of Parliament.
CAPSICUM HOUSE-FOR YOUNG LADIES,
CHAPTER WII.
MISS FLUKE RIDES THE GREY MARE. THE “DRUNKEN HUSBAND.
“STAY, madam,” we observed ; “we may disturb the young ladies.”
Saying this, we shrank behind a tree, and Miss GRIFFIN, gently
pressed by MR. Conks, felt herself squeezed aside from the gate she
was about to open. At a glimpse we saw that all the school was
assembled in a corner of the paddock, gathered about the Grey Mare,
whose keen, proud, handsome head—bearing a garland of bachelors'-
buttons, jump-up-and-kiss-me's, and Venus's-looking-glass, selected
and woven, as we afterwards learned, by Miss FLUKE-rose above the
talking, laughing crowd that with white, small, tender hands patted
the Mare's satin skin, or braided her silken mane, or offered her
delicate grass or newest hay. “Dear young ladies 1" we cried; “they
seem very fond of the creature.”
“It is a part of their education, sir,” said Miss GRIFFIN, “always to
remember what is due to the Grey Mare. It is always”—
Here Miss GRIFFIN was interrupted by a loud musical shouting,
and clapping of hands ; and the crowd of girls breaking apart, the
Grey Mare, throwing up her head, as though proud of its beauty,
leapt forth like a hound, Miss GRIFFIN–with beautiful presence of
mind—killing a ready scream by plugging her mouth with her pocket-
handkerchief. “It's that Miss FLUKE,” she cried at length, in a
smothered voice, at the same time unconsciously pinching the arm of
CoRKs, to relieve her feelings.
It tras Miss FLUKE. And without saddle or bridle—her little hand
buried in the creature's mane—she sat the Grey Mare as easily and as
smilingly as though she sat upon a cushion. And as the Mare broke
into a gallop, Miss FLUKE now waved a green branch over her head,
and now laid it on the Mare's neck; and the young lady's big, black
curls shook merrily about her glowing face; whilst her gleaming
eyes seemed to dally with danger, as though she loved it. It was
noon ; and sure we are that Apollo, with his eye for beauty, must
have pulled up his horses for one little point of time to admire Miss
FLUKE upon the Grey Mare.
“FLUKE”—“FLUKE, dear”—“FLUKE, love, don't,” cried and
shouted the girls, as the Mare galloped faster and faster; the young
lady mightily enjoying the fun, and waving a graceful bravado with
her green branch.
“She'll break her neck,” cried Miss GRIFFIN with solemn resigna-
tion. The next minute the Grey Mare leapt the five-barred gate like
a cat, coming down close at the feet of Miss GRIFFIN, pulled up by the
rider.
Miss GRIFFIN screamed. “I said I'd do it, and PALMER's lost the
gloves 1" cried Miss FLUKE, as, in a second, she subsided from the
Mare to the earth, shook her curls, dropt a curtsey, and bounded like
a ball out of sight.
“Dear Madam,” said the sonorous CoRks, “if she can only ride the
Grey Mare in that fashion all her life, what a GRIFFIN she'll make—
what a glory she'll shed upon Capsicum House !”
Miss GRIFFIN smiled a flurried smile, and begged for some minutes
to be excused. She must follow that rebel. MR. CoRks could not
suffer her to cross the Poultry-Yard alone; and left us to open the
gate for the re-admission of the Mare into her paddock. This done,
we sauntered with premeditated leisure—not to interfere with the

“Good morning. A nice cool draught that,” we answered.
“Ha, sir! They're all very well, these nice cool draughts,” cried
the stranger; “very well in their way; but oh, dear sir, what a
pleasant thing brandy-and-water would be, if there was no to-morrow
morning in it !”
The man had a loose, potable look. It was plain that his face, like
hot-house fruit, had ripened under a glass. It seemed to us very
strange that such a man should be found in such a place of floral
purity and sweetness. We had as soon looked for distilled juniper in
the cups of tulips.
The man looked heavily at us, and without another word put his
hand to his head as though remembrances of last might—like hammers
—were beating there.
“Pray, sir,” we said with our best politeness, “do you belong to
Capsicum House?”
“Not yet: I'm only here on trial; and I'm a little afeard I shan't
quite answer. They tell me I ain't half quarrelsome enough. I'm
sorry for it; and nobody can say more. I’m sorry for it,” he repeated
emphatically.
Finding him so far communicative we proceeded. “What, sir, may
be your profession here 7”
“Oh, I'm on liking for the Drunken Husband,” answered the
stranger, and we stared very widely. “Oh, I am, as sure as my name
is Blossoms. But, as I said, I'm afeard I shan't answer—I'm too
peaceable by half.”
“The man is intoxicated,” we thought ; and immediately MR.
Blossoms divined our opinion, for he very knowingly shook his head,
and cried, “No, I ain’t ; not a bit on it.”
“The Drunken Husband I" we exclaimed. “And is it possible that
Miss GRIFFIN can entertain, even in fiction, so horrid an animal 7”
“Miss GRIFFIN,” replied MR. Blossoms, “is a lady of the world ;
and though I may not be fort'nate enough to suit her—though I may
be too peaceable for the average run, as she says—I won't hear a
word agin her. Last night, you see, was my night for coming home

way of bus'ness, and a man must live. Finding ourselves in this

Company; but it's a poor matter by itself. Now if I can only add
to it, for a certainty, the Drunken Husband, I shall feel myself a
gentleman for life.”
We could not distinguish the true meaning of the man through
such attachment on the part of Miss GRIFFIN to first principles—
though they were the especial pets of the Lady of Capsicum—as to
imagine that, for hire and reward, she engaged the representative of a
bacchanal husband as a necessary agent in the complete education of
young British ladies for the future Wives of England. In our
ignorance, as it will be shown, we greatly undervalued the enthusiasm
of a devoted woman.
“You say, MR. Blossoms,” we continued, “that last night was
your night for coming home drunk 2 You do not mean to infer that
Capsicum House is your home 7”
“Most undeniably, sir, I do,” replied Blossoms boldly. “Look
here, sir, and understand me if you can.” We bowed. “Miss
GRIFFIN–who knows the heart of man as she knows the A, B, C,
and can put together and spell all sorts of feelings—Miss GRIFFIN
takes it upon herself to be mother to so many young women for so
much a year—and hard work it must be, take my word for it. She
teaches 'em life, as I may say, in a gallantee-show, afore they're
called upon, poor little things l to go and squeeze for themselves.
Every young lady here is brought up for a wife. Now, sir, Miss
GRIFFIN says that the whole philosophy—yes, I think that's it—the
whole philosophy of a good deal of wedlock is to make the best of an
early misfortin.”
|
“Humph 1 a sad employment,” we observed.
“Picking oakum's nothing to it,” said Blossoms, a little softened.
“Well, sir, it can't be denied—and Miss GRIFFIN, as a woman of the
world, knows it—drunkenness is a good deal about.”
We nodded in mournful affirmation.
“A husband, sir, with drink, is a wild beast—a lion coming home
to lay down with the lamb,” cried Blossoms, his eyes slightly
twinkling with emotion.
“You seem quite alive to the evil of the vice, MR. Blossoms ?”
“I’m all over alive to it, sir; and I intend to 'bolish it. That's
why I'm so ill this morning. You see, I’m hired—or, as Miss GRIF-
FIN says, my mission here at Capsicum House is this, to take the
part of the Drunken Husband ; and to do it so to the life—to make
such a noise at the door when I come home o' nights—and such a
hubbub when they let me into the passage—and to shout and sing and
sit upon the stairs, and swear I'll never go to bed—so that all the
young ladies, seeing what a tipsy husband is, should take the pledge
one among another, never to have anything to do with the animal.
That's my mission,” said Blossoms.
“Very noble, indeed,” we observed.
“Only the worst of it is,” urged Blossoms, with a mild melancholy
-“the worst of it is, I can't be violent enough. To be sure, they tell
me that I would kiss CARRAways last night ; that's getting a little
better; a little.” And Blossoms wanly smiled with self-encourage-
ment.
“Oh you'll do, no doubt : and then the cause is so noble,” we said.
“It's Miss GRIFFIN's notion, and she carries it out beautiful.
Every young lady, wrapt up in three shawls, with short candles, takes
it in turn to sit up till three in the morning, to see what a wretch I
am. CARRAways lets me in ; and when I’ve had a good wrangle
with the bannisters, and shown what a brute a lord o' the creation can
be, why then the gardener leads me to bed. It's all in Virtue's
cause,” says Miss GRIFFIN,-“but just now what a precious headache
Virtue's give me.”
Scotch Pleasantry.
A Scotch paper, the Glasgow Constitutional, in describing a funeral,
says, “MR. , and his son, were dressed in the full Highland
garb, and looked remarkably well.” This criticism of the appearance
of the mourners at a burial is in the happiest vein of Caledonian good
taste; for it is the distinguishing feature of Scotch gaiety, that it is
brought in at solemnities, where it is of course most wanted.

QUEEN CHRISTINA ON VESUVIUS.
HER feline Majesty CHRISTINA—ex-queen of Spain, and connubial
blessing of the Duke DE RIANZAREs—has by this time reached her
destination. It is not generally known that she is about to pass the
summer on Mount Vesuvius. At a consultation of the Faculty—
affectionately ordered by Louis-PHILIPPE—it was concluded that the
atmosphere of Paris was much too cold for Her Majesty; who was
thereupon advised to try a sulphur air, as more congenial with her
ardent temperament. Having successfully lived through so many
Spanish intrigues, it was thought that Vesuvius alone would be of
enduring service to Her Majesty. Whereupon, Louis-PHILIPPE—only
too happy to carry out the advice of the physicians—immediately
sent an order to Birmingham for the construction of an iron house, to
be screwed together and put up on the volcano, for the residence of
her salamandrine Majesty. The tenement was manufactured with that
despatch which characterizes the men of Birmingham; and—accord-
ing to last advices from our correspondent—was carried, piecemeal, on
the backs of mules, to the selected site, and immediately erected. Its
site is as near as is possible to the brim of the great crater; so that
Her Majesty may have the lulling sound of the ashes and pumice
falling upon the roof of her abode, and also enjoy that brimstone
atmosphere which her long political life has made so essential to her
daily comfort. Volcanoes, however, are apt to be deficient in courtesy
even to crowned heads: for we are told, that no sooner was it known
throughout the depths of the fiery regions, that CHRIsrna of Spain
was about to become his lodger, than old Vesuvius grumbled amazingly.
He was doubtless afraid that his own brimstone would be no match for
the article of QUEEN CHRISTINA.
ENGLISH AUTHORS–AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS.
“Wiscount PALMERsron to THE RIGHT Hon. R. PARENBAM,
English Ambassador to the United States.
“SIR,-In your relation with the United States of America, you
are to consider yourself directed to urge upon the Government the
| claims of English authors and English artists upon the American
people. Her Britannic Majesty, as mother of the British nation, and
nurse of letters and arts, has for some years contemplated, with con-
siderable pain, the manifold wrongs endured by her faithful subjects
at the hands of their transatlantic Saxon brethren. Various
American periodicals have been brought under HER MAJESTY's notice,
| purporting to have for their object the robbery of her faithful
subjects; and this, in utter violation of the spirit of international law
as established among civilized nations.
“You will be pleased to urge upon the American Cabinet, that
whereaspirates issuing from American ports, and professedly American
subjects, would—if captured in their attempt to seize the vessels of
British subjects—be hanged forthwith ; so should a like condign
punishment be visited upon the pirate behind the counter—“the land
rat,” who seizes upon the venture of the British author. Indeed,
piracy by sea is, as it appears to HER MAJESTY, a somewhat less
iniquitous practice than the buccaneering of booksellers. Sailing with
“a trade wind, and no ingenuous flag—a Death's-head and cross-bones
proper, in a field of black—they mercilessly rob miserable men of their
brains, remorselessly putting them all to the dollar. You will,
therefore, be pleased to urge upon the American Government that this
Fº scandalous to the boasted civilization of the age—can no
onger be endured by HER BRITANNic MAJESTY; who justly considers
such an offence, committed by the American people on their own
kindred, speaking the like mother tongue, as an additional outrage on
the principles of common honesty.—CAIN added atrocity to his crime
when the victim was his brother.
“If-as it may be urged by the American Government—it shall be
pleaded that the custom of stealing English letters and English art is
so long established that it is looked upon as one of the dearest privi-
leges of the American people, you are then instructed temperately,
but firmly to decline all further correspondence with the American
Cabinet, and to immediately repair on board the Chesapeake frigate,
that carries out this despatch.
“No less than six engravings—six different portraits of PRINCE AL-
Bººr—have been pirated by American printsellers, to the great pain
of HER MAJESTY, and of Pºnce ALBERT in particular; who has failed
to recognise, in the pirated prints, that heroic look and true military
bearing that have endeared him to the country, as one of her best-
painted, and best-engraved, Field-Marshals.
“In conclusion, you are to energetically urge upon the Government
the opinion of Hea BRITANNic MAJEsty, that all pacific relations
between America and England must cease, unless the pirated plates
aforesaid (with all the impressions of H. R. H. Pance Albert, Field-
Marshal, Chancellor of Cambridge, Hat-maker to the Horse-Guards,
Beadle of Windsor Park, Lord High Admiral of the Fleet, and one of
the Chief Justices in Eyre) beforthwith delivered into your hands,
preparatºry to the passing of an international law of copyright. And
these shall be your instructions.

To Mr. Punch.
-- SIR,
“I observe that an individual has written a letter to the Times,
to complain that people are not allowed to bathe in the Serpentine
until after the hour of eight in the evening. I want to know why they
should go to bathe in the Serpentine: why do they not go to some
hotel for their baths; for instance, to the Old Hummums? Oh! but
perhaps I shall be told that such persons cannot afford to go to the
Old Hummums, and that the Serpentine is the only place they have to
bathe in. That maybe; and I grant that there is danger in going into
cold water late in the evening. But what is to be done? The writer
in the Times recommends, in plain terms, that the frequenters of the
Ring should go away earlier. Yes; but he forgets that this arrange-
ment would interfere with our dinner hours.
“It may be inconvenient to the populace to bathe after sunset, but
so it is to us to dine by daylight. Perhaps bathing in the Serpentine
might be permitted in the morning until twelve or one o'clock. But
this would incommode some of us whose medical attendants have
prescribed early rising. On the whole, Mr. Punch, I think, after all,
that the wisest course would be to prevent the people from bathing in
the Serpentine altogether—by providing baths and wash-houses for
the labouring classes. Inever before saw the wit of your advocacy of
those institutions, but I now agree with you decidedly.

The open sea Blocked up.
THE number of ships going to the Black Sea to load with corn, is
said to be so great that it is quite difficult to get along the Archipelago,
in consequence of the crowd of vessels. The Sea of Marmora has all
the appearance of Fleet Street at four o'clock in the afternoon; and
the marine police have as much as they can do to prevent obstruction
to the oceanic thoroughfare. Rules, we believe, have been laid down,
that in taking up, figure-heads are to be turned towards Russia, and
ships are then to drive off in the direction of the Dardanelles.

on all sides against the injustice of making an

employed in its illustration, deserves to be
worn in the most conspicuous manner. We
wish some true friend to the Fine Arts would
set the fashion, during the summer season, of
making an external article of dress of the
shirt, by wearing it en blouse, and thus pre-
venting the concealment of those exquisite
productions of the artist's pencil which giye
to the linen the lineaments of some favourite

the style of its treatment ; then why
should the “Portrait of a Gentleman's

altogether very brilliant productions. For our own parts, we shrink
back overpowered at the mere contemplation of so much blonde and
barège, such mountains of tulles and taffetas. Sometimes, however,
a bit of homely description comes in, that is quite refreshing ; and it
is truly delightful to arrive at a paragraph which informs us that one
of the ladies' was present at Court “in that simple" garment — a
corded petticoat.” Her appearance must have afforded a quiet contrast
to the silks and satins around, which must have been delightful to
look upon. -
Some of the costumes of the gentlemen must have been rather em-
barrassing. For instance, a Viscount, we are told, “wore the triple
collars of the Orders of the Bath, Guelph, and the Tower and Sword.”
Considering that the day was almost a dog-day, the Viscount in three
collars, “one a-top o' tother,” like the successive layers of colds
caught by the hackney coachman, must have been fearfully embar-
rassing. It is a pity that one of the three collars could not have been
made into a ByRoN tie for the occasion. The Chief Judges of each of
the three Courts wore “a portcullis about their necks, in addition to
their gold º of SS,” which must have given them a stiff-necked
appearance, highly conducive to an aspect of dignity.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
PUNCH IN NEWGATE I
It is well to be prepared for the worst : this is, in truth, a part of
the divine philosophy of Punch ; hence, on Wednesday last, we took a
turn in Newgate—and, we must confess it, were most courteously
received by the authorities—that we might view the premises with a
view to our probable tarrying there. It seems that the magnanimous
KING of PRUssIA has complained to the Senate of the free town of
Hamburgh—the free town, mind ye—of “a little satirical journal”
there published, and called Mephistopheles, which dared to ridicule the
late speech of Prussia's king. Royal dulness, it appears, does not love
a jest; hence, on the royal complaint, the writers of Mephistopheles
were fined 150 francs, and sentenced to a month's imprisonment.
We do not feel ourselves safe. At this very moment, for aught we
know, the CHEVALIER BUNSEN may be closeted with LoRD PALMER-
ston, insisting upon
the imprisonment of
Punch for having
treated the Prussian
Eagle with no more
respect than if it were
a piece of common
poultry—ameredung-
hill cock. We have
looked at our lodging
in Newgate, which,
after it has been made
classic stone by our
tenancy, will be worth
at least five hundred
a-year in fees to the
exhibiting turnkey.

gate to behold the

noses . We sit prepared. We have our carpet-bag in readiness, and
are screwed up for the worst.
We have, with our best condolence, sent a proof of the above to
our suffering brethren of the Mephistoplicles.
PUNCH'S FUTURE PARLIAMENT.
THE eve of an election suggests to us, as it probably does to many
others, the necessity of a further reform in Parliament. Our project
is this. Let the representation be entirely re-modelled. Let it be
placed on a perfectly novel basis, which will secure for the country
legislators who understand the feelings and wishes of their constituents;
or, in other words, know what they are about. Instead, therefore,
of mere members for counties and boroughs, let each borough and each
county return members for classes. For instance, let there be members
for workmen and members for masters ; members for agriculturists,
and members for landlords; members for clergymen, and members for
dissenters; members for professional people, and members for trades-
men ; members for soldiers, and members for sailors. Of course, there
should be members for literary men; or, at least, one member—it is
not for Punch to indicate the fit and proper person. The ladies, also,
ought by all means to have a representative. Some, perhaps, to
secure universal representation, would have even members for convicts.
We will not go quite so far as that ; but we will be so bold as to pro-
pose members for paupers ; aware as we are that we shall thus shock
the feelings of many persons of respectability. The great thing for the
country, we are convinced, will be class legislation—legislating equally
for all classes.
A Walking Dioceses
A Correspondent of the Times states, that the REv. MR. HALE is
Archdeacon of Middlesex, Canon of St. Paul's, Vicar of Cripplegate,
and Master of the Charter House. Really, MR. HALE combines in his
own person such a number of clergymen, that the Ecclesiastical Com-
missioners ought to erect him into a diocese, and give him a Bishop
all to himself.
PORT IN PERIL.
MR PUNCH has been commissioned to present the subjoined Petition
to Parliament :—
To the Houses of Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled :
The humble Petition of the Resident Fellows, Tutors, and
Heads of Houses of the Universities of Oxford and Cam-
bridge, of the Beneficed Clergy, of the Inns of Court, and of
the Merchants, Bankers, and Traders of the City of London,
Humbly Sheweth—
That your Petitioners view with great alarm and apprehension the
present very unsatisfactory state of affairs in Portugal:
That the wine produced by Oporto is that which is commonly called
Port ; and that this said liquor, Port wine, is indispensable to the
comfort and well-being of your Petitioners :
That, in the abstract, your Petitioners approve of the principle of non-
intervention in foreign politics, and that as long as they were able to
get their Port wine they had no objection to its being acted upon ; but
now that their supply of the necessary beverage is endangered, they
conceive that interference in the affairs of Portugal is imperative :
Your Petitioners therefore humbly entreat, that you will speedily
take such measures as to your wisdom may seem advisable for the
tranquillisation of the kingdom of Portugal generally, and particularly
for the restoration of order in that part of it called Oporto, to the end
that your Petitioners may continue to have their Port wine as heretofore.
And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.
*...* Punch will willingly present this petition; at the same time, for
the consolation of the parties who have intrusted him with it, he begs
to assure them, that, however affairs may prevent exportation, they
may rely on being able to get as much Port wine in this country as
ever.

too many of our young men of ton, utterly blasé, although only in his
twenty-fourth year. Blest, luckily, with a mother of excellent prin-
ciples, (who had imbued his young mind with that Morality which
is so superior to all the vain pomps of the world !), it had not been
always the young Earl's lot to wear the coronet for which he now in
sooth cared so little. His father, a Captain of Britain's navy, struck
down by the side of the gallant Collingwood in the Bay of Fundy,
left little but his sword and spotless name to his young, lovely, and
inconsolable widow, who passed the first years of her mourning in

MoDEL ADDRESSES FOR CANDIDATES.
The difficulty of framing addresses to the
various electors throughout the country,
has suggested to the benevolent mind of
Mr. Punch, the philanthropic idea of supply-
ing that “real blessing” to candidates. . In
order to accommodate all parties, we shall
write for each an exposition of political
sentiments; and we freely give permission

representatives have not only the least to
say, but the least capacity for saying it.
We shall therefore commence with the
ADDRESS For THE COUNTRY PARTY
CANDIDATE.
“In coming before you to ask for your
votes, I feel that the present prospects of
somewhat gloomy. Everything British is suffering under
sion: the British Constitution has been so long shouting
our party are
a.
for help, that it has almost shouted itself into a hoarseness, which has
rendered its voice inaudible. The British Lion sits crouching between
the combined weight of Free Trade and a Whig Ministry. The British
Labourer no longer sweetens the bread of labour with the calm satis-
faction of patient industry. The cheerful song with which he accom-
panied his daily work, enabling him to take six shillings-a-week to
his wife and family, is no longer heard, but he thinks of the corn now
coming through the Sea of Marmora to compete with him, and his song
becomes a sigh, his whistling ends in wailing. My object in going into
Parliament will be to rally the remnants of the country party round
the standard of our ancestors, and restore the smile to the wan features
of the British Lion. If I can succeed in doing this; if I should be so
fortunate as to add one vibration to that tail, which has become stag-
nant from distress; if I can establish one honest twinkle in the eye of
the British labourer; if I can keep one ear of foreign-grown grain from
the ports of this country, I shall feel that I have not laboured in vain;
and when I resign once more my trust into your hands, I shall do so
with the comfortable conviction that I have played the part of a true
patriot.—N.B. My committee sits daily at the Duck and Thunder,
where any information will be gladly received, and beer liberally
supplied to any elector of staunch principles.”
We will now attempt an
ADDRESS Fort. A conservative CANDIDATE.
“In soliciting your aid at the approaching struggle, I avow myself
a follower of those principles of which SiR Robert PEEL is the
highest example, and which will be found thoroughly Conservative in
their influence. The plan of that distinguished statesman has ever
been to preserve to himself the merit not only of his own views, but
of those professed by his opponents; and hence the truly Conservative
character of all his proceedings. He and his adherents have allowed
| others to talk, and have themselves been content to Do, when leaving
undone became dangerous or inexpedient ; and hence we may
assume for ourselves the title of the great DO party, in opposition
to the great TALK party formed by our political antagonists. We
pledge ourselves to continue the same course that has hitherto secured
our popularity. If the independent electors require mere verba, let
them choose my Whig opponent ; but if acta are needed, let them
send into the House of Commons a Conservative, such as I declare
myself.”
We now come to the last, though, in promise at all events, by no
means the least of the addresses, in the shape of an
Address Fort. An ultra-RADICAL CANDIDATE.
“Though I come forward to ask the votes of those who have them'
I would scorn to represent your property if I did not also represent
your throbbing impulses of philanthropic patriotism; and Ishould little
regard your ten-pound households if I did not hope to take with me
into the House of Commons the warm sympathies of millions of my
fellow-countrymen. I do not go into Parliament as member for your
humble borough, if I go at all; but I enter the legislature as the embodi-
ment of a myriad of gushing hopes, patriotic yearnings, and fond
anticipations, which I will either die or realise. I hope to see the day
when we shall have good, honest day-labourers spending their nights
in the House of Commons. Some candidates object to pledges. Perhaps
they have good reasons for their hesitation : I have none, and I there-
l fore pledge myself never to cease from my labours until the people
We shall begin with that class whose

with the peasant—until bread is so cheap, that the bakers give it
away instead of selling it—until everything that is wanted may be
had merely for the asking—and, in fact, until there is a thorough
radical reform in all our institutions.”
WONDERS WILL NEVER CEASE.
Among the literary novelties of the day is a book called “Why and
Because,” which is advertised as being “intended for young persons
with a clock face and moveable hands.” We never yet met with a
young person having a clock face, though moveable hands are by no
means uncommon among the juvenile members of society. Indeed, the
difficulty of making the little folks keep their hands still has become
quite proverbial. A clock face remains a mystery to us, for the nearest
approach to anything of the kind we have ever seen is a visage
indicating that the party to whom it belongs is up to the time of day,
*...* the phenomenon of a clock face has in our experience been
realised.
THE BLIND NUISANCE.
(Imitated from Byrox.)
He that don't always bend his head
When London streets he fain would thread,
But with a mild and stately air,
From left to right doth idly stare,
Or looking round him, slightly lingers,
Twirling his guard-chain round his fingers,
Will, as he gives a look behind,
Not seeing where he means to go,
Receive from a tremendous blind,
An almost stupefying blow.
So darkly low, so lowly dim,
It breaks the hat from crown to rim.
The taller victim, as he goes,
Receives the blind below his nose;
While the less lofty passer-by,
Sheathes the fierce ledge-point in his eye.
A cry of vengeance fills the air–
'Tis vain, police are wanting there.

atrocities of advertising Literature.
We perceived the other day, among the Times' advertisements, an
intimation that “a single-handed footman, who knows his business, is
wanted, at once, in a small genteel family.” There is something
horrible in the idea of a person, being satisfied with a dismembered
flunkey, and taking one with a single hand, in the hope, we presume, of
getting at a reduced rate the services of a mutilated menial. As to
the poor fellow “knowing his business,” that seems a cruel mockery;
for what is the use of his knowing his business, when he is deprived of
half the power of doing it 2 We shall hear next of wooden-legged hall-

THE BATTLE OF WORCESTER. PAINTED FOR THE RIGHT HON. MR. PUNCH.
THE THAMES DERBY.
UR songs of the Thames Navy have ful-
filled their object, by arousing in the
fresh-water bosom of the river mariner
those feelings of enthusiasm for which
the British Tar was formerly conspi-
cuous. We are quite sure, that as long
the naval heart is in the right place,
our country has nothing to dread; and
when we look at the hospital for our
decayed seamen, we often exclaim in
an outburst of enthusiasm, “As long
as England has a Greenwich, she will
never have a Wapping !” It was there-
fore with much delight that we found
our efforts to bring out the energies of
the Thames Tar had been so far successful as to have roused a feeling
among the ploughers of the deep—though, by the bye, the ploughing is
often made more complete by the shallowness of the water, which sends
the vessels aground—it was, we say, with infinite satisfaction that
we heard resolutions had been come to for the purpose of getting up
a sort of Thames Derby-day on the river.
The event was to be celebrated, not by a mere competition for a cup,
as at Ascot ; but by a regular Cup and Ball—the Ball following the
presentation of the Cup to the fortunate winner.
At a preliminary meeting of influential naval officers, including the
Admiral of the Richmond squadron, the Rear-Admiral of the Pink, and
other distinguished nautical celebrities, it was resolved, that there
should be an annual race, open to all steamers not over five years old;
that the heat should be limited to one chaldron of Wallsend coals; and
that a small sweep should be contributed by each competitor for the
funnel of the winner. Directly the scheme was made known, owners
began to enter their boats very freely, and the following were among
the favourites:—
Bachelor . . by Windlass. out of Cofferdam, ,
Daffydowndilly , , Cognovit . , , Pawn.
Waverley . . Accident . , Jeopardy.
Childe Harold . ,, Pullaway . , Mud.
Moonbeam . . , Magic . . . , Cucumber.
There were other favourites on the list, which included most of the
well-known Thames steamers, all of which had several backers.
Betting was tolerably, brisk in the early part of the day, and the
various captains sat down to the Trial Stakes at one, which turned out to
be very tough work, though by going at it tooth and nail, the difficulty
was soon vanquished. At length the time for the race itself drew
near, and the Grand Stand at the end of Blackfriars Pier was
crowded with the élite of the Thames virtuosi and steam-boat dilettanti
of the Metropolis.
The Lord Mayor attended in his private (coal) barge, and among
the general company we observed MEssRs. SMITH, Jones, BRowN, and
RoBINson. The company seems to have been enlivened with music,
and the attendance of Coles's Celebrated Rheumatic Band had been
expected; but this treat was not forthcoming; and though HERE
Schwartz, in his usual handsome manner, offered the gratuitous use of
his ophycleide, he was unable to give the benefit of his services, and
the ophycleide, without a performer, could not make itself instrumental
to the amusement of the company.
Everything being now ready for the race, the competitors were
placed in their proper positions. Most of them looked well, with the
exception of the Richmond lot, the crews of which appeared to be half
asleep; and the Captain of one seemed anxious to repose upon his
Laurel—which happened to be the name of his vessel. At length, after
various false starts, Snowdrop shot out first, followed up by Pink, while
Jasmine continued creeping alongside very cleverly. Hridegroom now
went to work, with Bachelor and Bride at his heels, as if they had all
three been intent on a steeple-chase, when suddenly Bee appeared to
wax rather energetic; but Cricket coming up, took the sting completely
out of her. By this time Ant, who had been working industriously
from the first, got near to the front rank, but Bee regaining her ground,
became so exceedingly buzzy that she seemed likely to win, had not
Cricket run in and bowled her out with wonderful dexterity.
In the meantime, Waterman No. 12, and Citizen A, had been making
all the running, and ultimately the former won, by a neck-or-nothing
dash through the arch of Blackfriars Bridge, amid the shouts of the
crowded assembly. The other vessels were not placed, and indeed
both Starlight and Moonlight were so far off, that they did not make
their appearance till late in the evening, while Laurel had become
planted in the ground from the beginning of the contest.

dig out the mummy of a policeman, and after unrolling a layer of
capes, might find a tertiary deposit of half-a-crown in the victim's
pocket. Here might be the hat of Higgs the drover, and here the
skeleton of a suffocated pig, all thrown higgledy-piggledy together in
a rudis indigestaque moles, such as Holborn now presents in its living
aspect, and such as it would be, were an earthquake suddenly to devour
it. We are sure that the most skilful of scientific speculators would not
be able to decide whether the spot had been used chiefly for animals or for
men, since Smithfield renders Holborn Hill as much a pasture for flocks
and herds as it is a promenade for bipeds or a thoroughfare for vehicles.
LITERARY ORDERS EXECUTED ON THE SHORTEST
NOTICE.
A NAPLEspaper has the following paragraph —
“Nicolo Conhidi, of Corfu, furnishes, in four-and-twenty hours, a complete comedy;
in eight-and-forty hours, a tragedy, or the libretto of an opera; in seventy-two hours,
an entire poem, in stanzas of six verses, with the exclusion of any particular letter or
letters of the alphabet. The poet resides in the Hotel de Londres, Rue Guantari,
No. 22, a Naples.”
The preceding advertisement is enough to make MR. G. P. P. X. Y. Z.
JAMEs ashamed of his indolence; and calculated to achieve the phe-
nomenon of inventing a blush on the cheek of MonsLEUR ALExANDRE
DUMAs for his extreme slowness. We should say that SIGNOR Nicolo
would be the very man to finish the Catalogue of the British Museum;
and we have no doubt he would be perfectly willing to leave out any
particular letter or letters, which the Trustees might think de trop, or
out of place in such a literal publication.
This exclusion of certain letters is something new in the art of
writing poetry. We never heard of a person having an antipathy to
certain diphthongs or liquids; probably there are some sensitive minds
who faint at the sight of a K, or go into hysterics at the mere mention
of the letter X ; for there is no accounting for antipathies, any more
than there is for tastes. It would be rather awkward, however, for
the Corfusian poet, if a lady entertained a violent hatred against all
the vowels, and gave him an order for a poem with the exclusion of
A, E, I, O, U. The poet's only chance of executing his commission
would be, to write the poem in the Welsh language, which has been
pronounced by a great linguist to be the most consonant of all lan-
guages. Another item which surprises us in the SIGNor's bill of
fare is, that the libretto of an opera takes longer to write than a
comedy. We are confident he is not acquainted with our Bohemian
Girls and Matildas, or else he would have amended his advertisement
in the following style —“A complete comedy in four-and-twenty
hours, and the libretto of an opera whilst the person waits.” It is quite
a new era in the literary world, when an author can be hired, like a
cab, by the hour. There should be a scale of charges drawn out, to
prevent imposition. We suggest the following :—
AUTHORS' FARES.
The hire of an Author—first hour - - -
Ditto ditto second hour - - - ... le.
And after the rate of 6d. for every succeeding hour, and 6d. for every fractional part
of an hour.
The above is for authors writing only with one pen; but for those who have been
trained to write with two pens—one in each hand, after the DuMAs system—two-thirds
Enore of the above fares are to be taken.
Stoppages not allowed. Backfare, or reading over the copy, to be le. for 100 pages
2s.
of prose, and 6d. for 500 pages of poetry. In cases of dispute as to time or length, the
: to be read and measured by tº: parish beadle, and the expenses to be paid by the
losing party. All ideas, jokes, metaphors, and sentiments, old, middle-aged, or new,
left in the MS., to be the property of the hirer for 12 months; but the author to be
answerable for all libels above 40s. Authors hired by the day, week, month, or year, to
be paid according to private agreement.
There is already an office in the Strand for the hire of authors, where
all kinds of literary job-work are executed upon the smallest terms,
from a sermon to a conundrum for a tobacco-paper. We should not
be surprised shortly to hear that there was a stand for authors opened
in Stationers' Hall, where any rich amateur who is ambitious to reach
popularity, can engage any vehicle he pleases to arrive at that end ;
no matter whether it be in the walks of fact, or fiction, or a little of
both, such as history—or neither, such as MR. AINsworth's romances.
SIGNoR Nicolo Corridi might come over and officiate at the head of
them, as the literary waterman. Alas! that the ranks of literature
|
should be reduced to those of a hackney-coach stand 1
THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH’S LOCUST.S.
We are sorry to learn that the wheat in the neighbourhood of
Blenheim has, to a great extent, been devoured by locusts, in the shape
of hares and pheasants. The Globe informs us, that
“It is a sad fact that, from the very large quantity of game preserved on the DUKE
or MARLBorough's estate at Blenheim, some of the corn-growing land in the locality
will not produce a bushel of corn to the acre. His Grace has some hundreds of acres of
arable land in his occupation, which is now unproductive, and which has not this season
been cultivated."
The man, it has been said, deserves the thanks of his country, who
makes two blades of wheat grow where but one grew before. What
does he deserve who causes an acre to yield but one bushel of corn,
and the land on which corn grew, or might have grown, in abundance,
to produce none whatever ?
Unholy Matrimony.
QUEEN IsABELLA of Spain, it is said, intends, for good and sufficing
reasons, to apply to his Holiness the Pope for a divorce from the hus:
band of her compulsion. Though a marriage may have proved the
destruction of a woman's happiness, its dissolution may not in ordinary
cases be allowable. The nuptial knot is a hallowed ligature—when
duly tied ; but this instance is exceptional. Whom Louis-PHILIPPE
hath joined together, it may be competent to man to put asunder.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
THE COMING ELECTION.
The House of Commons is at present full of contrast, caused by the ºpathy of
those members who don't mean to stand again, and the energy of those whº
mean to ask a renewal of the confidence of their constituents. The former will
sit still and even sleep over the voting away of thousands in the miscellaneous
estimates, while the latter will throw themselves into an agony of excitement at the
possible waste of a single halfpenny. . To the retiring member, the *.:
; while the
aspiring member loses no opportunity of showing that he continues alive till the
the session is a tedious bore, which he desires to hasten to a close
very last to his legislative duties. If the reader will but
AND ON THAT,
LOOK ON THIS PICTURE,
he will form a very correct notion, by which he can comprehend at one view who
will be the candidates at the forthcoming election.
A NICE NEW NEWSPAPER.
We have a great fault to find with our daily contempo-
raries: what we complain of is, the badness of their news.
Not that the intelligence which they contain is inaccurate;
on the contrary, it is, unfortunately, for the most part, too
true. We are sure that there remains a want to be sup-
plied in the matter of newspapers. There is a large and
respectable class of persons who have nothing in the
world to vex them but the state of the country, of which
they read such alarming accounts in the diurnal press.
We are confident that they would be glad of a paper on
their breakfast-tables which would exhilarate and cheer,
instead of depressing and disheartening them. Let some
enterprising capitalist, therefore, start a new daily journal.
Let it be called the Morning Comforter. Let its infor-
mation, if possible, be true; if not, let its columns be
replenished by the imagination; somewhat, for example,
after the fashion following :-
Good News FROM IRELAND–SLIGo.—We are happy to
say that both landlords and people, about here, are setting
to work in earnest to ensure, as far as in them lies, better
times. Now that we are putting our shoulders to the
wheel, there is no doubt we shall get on.
ABUNDANCE AT LIVERPool.-In this town, at least, the
“twopenny buster” seems destined to changeits appellation.
The species of loafso vulgarly denominated now sells at 1:#d.
THE SAFETY of RAILway TRAVELLING.—For the last
six months not a single accident has occurred on the
Eastern Counties Railway.
THE INcomE-TAx AND THE REVENUE.—So ample have
been the returns upon exciseable commodities during the
last quarter, that it will now become possible, with perfect
safety, for Government to venture on the abolition of the
income-tax. |
It is generally admitted that poetry is the charm and
solace of life; the enjoyment of which, we are sure, would
be much promoted by the introduction of such poetry as
we have above written into newspapers.
NATURAL HISTORY OF THE CITY PIG.
THE generic name of this animal is Sus Aldermanicus; variety,
Londinensis. It may be placed at the head of the porcine family,
being the greatest known hog. The City Pig possesses, in an eminent
degree, the characteristics peculiar to its species—excessive voracity,
and love of dirt. It is an indiscriminate feeder, as will appear from
the specification of a few only of the articles which it has been known
to consume at a single meal:—Turtle, fish of a dozen kinds dressed in
as many different ways, venison, currant-jelly, roast sirloin, green
goose, blanc-mange, turkey poults, Italian cream, asparagus-tops,
oyster patties, quail, cabinet-pudding, partridge, cheesecakes, phea-
sant, Charlotte Russe, teal, plover, widgeon, prawns, woodcock, cucum-
ber, custard, and lobster salad ; together with iced punch, Cham-
pagne, Hock, ale, porter, Sauterne, and sparkling Moselle ; besides
Stilton and Neufchâtel cheese, nuts, apples, peaches, preserved ginger,
pineapple, almonds and raisins, cheese-cakes, sweet biscuits, and
strawberries: with Port, claret, Burgundy, and brandy-and-water.
The digestion of the City Pig is proportionate to its appetite; so
that it frequently acquires the weight of twenty stone. Its predilection
for dirt is yet more remarkable than its propensity for food. It
delights in the foulest mud, and has its favourite cess-pools and sewers,
in which it loves to lie and wallow. It is especially partial to Smithfield
Market, in the mire of which Paradise it revels with almost frantic
enjoyment. To any clamour that may be raised for the purpose of
driving it from these beloved haunts, it replies by a succession of
angry grunts.
An attempt to dislodge it from the slush of its choice occasions it
instantly to set up its bristles, and display symptoms of violent irri-
tation. To the endeavour to stir it, the animal simply opposes the
passive resistance of its bulk and weight, which nothing but a number
of very strong men in parliament could overcome. It possesses, in so
striking a degree, the common quality of the Pachydermata, thickness of
hide, that the sharpest poke will not induce it to budge an inch ; and
so dense is its skull, that there is no driving anything into its head.
The uncleanly habits of the City Pig, to which it is addicted with all
the obstinacy of its species, occasion it to be a most dangerous neigh-
bour. The air in its vicinity is poisoned by the exhalations emitted
from the various nuisances which it rejoices in ; whence the districts
which it inhabits are devastated by fever and pestilence. It is highly
desirable, therefore, that the City Pig should be removed from its
sphere of mischievousness. It required the power of a Sovereign to
any further rise in bread will be quite impossible.”
rid England of its wild boars, and the authority of Government must
now be exerted to clear the City of its pigs, or at least to impose a
compulsory cleanliness on those dirty animals. |
-
THE CHELSEA PENSIONERS.
THEse veterans have been reviewed, and though they went gallantly
through the exertion at the time, we understand that many of them
have felt the fatigue a great deal since, and have been suffering less
from the mock action than
the re-action that followed.
Though they have all, in
their turn, stood fire, they
were unable to stand the
sun; and the heat of the
day is more dreadful to
them than they once used
to find the heat of the
battle. It has been proposed,
therefore, to allow a parasol
to each as a portion of his
accoutrements. This adjunct
to the military equipment of
the veteran corps will be a
great consolation to those
who ought, at least, to be
allowed the shade of their
parasols, since they are no
longer permitted to repose
under the shade of their
laurels. It is all very well
to bask in the sunshine of
glory; but at a certain time
of life, “taking it cool” is
much to be desired.
"A SUGGESTION FROM SIBTHORPE.

PARTY BOOTS.
It is an old saying, “Tell me what company you keep, and I will
tell you what you are ;” but we say, “If you want a character, let us
look at your boots, and we will give you one.”. Phrenologists may
fumble over the head; but looking at the heads of politicians to form
an estimate of the quality, we soon discover that there is nothing in
them—the sole is the true criterion for judging of a man's pos-ition,
dis-position, or even his in-dis-position to serve the interests of his
fellow-creatures. Let us make a brief examination of a few pairs of
boots and shoes, that we may judge of the standing their wearers are
entitled to. -
As Whiggery happens to have a pretty firm footing just now, let us
examine the chaussure of that party.
Here we find the understanding in tole-
rably good order, but there is an exhi-
bition of foppery which is not quite
agreeable, and which would prevent the
owner from taking the straightforward
path if there seemed to be anything in
the way that might prove a little incon-
venient. The Whig chaussure does not
seem quite so well adapted as it ought
to be for going boldly on wherever duty
directs, regardless of an occasional mess
into which all are liable to fall, but which any one with a stout sole and
a good serviceable understanding may easily go through, with a fair
amount of perseverance and courage. LoRD MoRPETH's retiring over-
delicacy with regard to the Health
of Towns Bill shows the peculiarity
of the Whig chaussure, which partakes
a great deal more of the weak insig-
nificant pump than the bold boot that
boots not where it goes, so that the
path leads in the right direction.
The Country party foot-gearis of a
different stamp, but is not less expres-
sive of the position of its wearers.
There is a desire to retain the top,
s although the thing has gone by long
ago, and the pretensions to such a
distinction have become utterly ridi-
culous.
The Young England, or DisBAELI
chaussure, is something really melan
choly to contemplate. There is a sad
indication of being on its last legs, .
and the curl of the toe bespeaks that *
all is up with this unhappy section of a
politicians. Even Holywell Street, W
with all its associations, would refrain :
from naming a price for this worn-
out remnant of “leather and pru-
nella.”
High Church and Low Church are
strongly marked in the article which now
occupies our attention. The boots of the
former evince a starched stiffness truly
characteristic of the spirit that: animates
their wearer; but it is “quite another pair
of shoes” with Low Church, whose comfort-
able modesty bespeaks
a mixture of humility
and selfishness that
will be found blended
in a very great degree
in the class we have
laid by the heels in
the annexed illustra-
tion... We shall wind
up our gallery with
the working man's chaussure; and any one
who looks upon the picture may judge that
the labourer is reduced sometimes to very shocking extremities.
PUNCH'S MEDICAL ADVICE TO THE NATION.
WELL, MR. BULL, I have heard your story. Your complaint consists
in a disorder of the circulating medium, accompanied by febrile excite-
ment, and depression of your nervous system. You are suffering, in fact,
from the effects of the railway fever, which attacked you about a year-
and-a-half ago. This affection produced a most serious disturbance of
your economy; it occasioned a lavish expenditure of your means, which,
if you had husbanded them, would have enabled you to defy atmo-
spherical and all other injurious influences. Your present symptoms are
those of reaction, consequent on an inflammatory process.
You also consider that your constitutional disorder is in part owing
to a local disease, situated in your Irish region. ... I am rather disposed
to refer that local disease to a constitutional origin. Your chief
symptom, you say, is a tightness of the chest. This, sir, arises from
congestion of the cavities of your heart, which I need not tell you lies
in your Bank; the valves of that organ will not act, and their closure
may be attributed to the treatment you received in 1844, whilst you
were under the hands of that medical gentleman at Tamworth.
The numbness and paralytic indications which you feel in your
lower extremities are all referable to the obstruction at the centre of
your circulation. Your primary attack was occasioned by plethora or
fullness, producing a derangement of the functions of the brain, evi-
denced by bulimia, or canine appetite, which, I should explain to you,
is an inordinate craving for strange food—sometimes, as in your case,
for gold. Now, in plethora webleed; though it is better, if possible,
to content ourselves with equalising the circulation. However, you
have been bled more than sufficiently; indeed, you are evidently suf-
fering from excessive venesection. Now, then, for your treatment.
Although you are in a state of debility, you are an in
subject; I therefore dissuade you from recourse to artificial stimulants.
These will merely palliate present sensations; ultimately they will
only aggravate your woes. What I recommend to you is, for the next
three or four months, extreme moderation in diet. Take your three
meals daily, but eat and drink at each about half of what you have
been accustomed to. Live, in short, upon sixpence a day, and earn it.
Avoid alcoholic liquors, especially whisky and gin; for the conversion
of grain into alcohol is a chemical process, which in the present state
of your system is peculiarly likely to disagree with you. . Let your
bread be at least a day old before you eat it; and let it be made of
seconds instead of fine flour. Any surplus nutriment that you may
have, may be distributed over the pores or mouths at your extremities,
which are at present in a state of inanition. You will find your account
in pinching the stomach to feed the pore.
By-and-bye, when you feel yourself a little firmer on the legs, and
able to get about, take this prescription to the shop of the old lady in
Threadneedle Street, and get one of the assistants to put it up :
TR : eſ £. 6. O. Jil. ‘Biff j. Jo 6e casfied iwiwediateſy.
The price of the medicine will be only about three per cent. ; a few
repetitions of it will complete your cure, and all that distressing sense
of pressure which you now experience will be removed. In the mean-
time, keep up your spirits ; and for that purpose, amongst others,
continually read my book. I believe, sir, that your vital organs are
untouched, and that your disorder is merely functional. And now, sir,
go about your business; and as to my fee, considering your present
circumstances, I shall not trouble you for more than threepence.
Punch's Railway Intelligence.
We regret to perceive that our own little line at Kensington is still
unenlivened by traffic, and as the steed starves while the grass grows,
so are the shareholders starving while the weeds are springing up on
this suburban railway. We understood that the Great Western had
adopted the poor little outcast, in which case it would no doubt
become strong and healthy; but at present it remains in a puny
condition. We are sure that nothing is required but respectable
connections and active treatment to make this little railway all that
its best friends could desire.
Memoir of a Vould-be Members
THE versatility of Mr.CochRANE, the would-be M.P. for Westminster,
is well known; but his talent in this line is scarcely appreciated.
It ought, in justice to this gentleman, to be known, that his military
exploits have been rather remarkable. He was warmly interested a
few years ago in the affairs of Portugal; but such was his extreme
impartiality, that he made first to Don PEDRo, and afterwards to Don
Miguel, offers of his services, which were declined by both.
The facility with which MR. CochRANE can adapt himself to different
views may be useful to him in his political career, and may enable him,
when rejected by the Liberals in Westminster, to fit himself to a Con-
servative constituency at some future period.

POWER OF FRENCH INVENTION.
The Siècle informs its readers, that the success of JENNY
LIND is altogether a matter of money. The enthusiasm has
been got up by the critics, who have been paid 20,000
francs for their panegyrics. Our French contemporary, of
course, is well informed, though it is rather too bad that
the secret should have been betrayed in this treacherous
manner. Which of the papers has played false? Is it a
morning, or a weekly, or a twice-a-weekly, or an evening
journal, who is the base traitor 2 - We advise all the
theatrical critics to combine together for the purpose of
discovering who amongst them has revealed the awful secret
of the critical fraternity, and to demand back his share of
the 20,000 francs. By the bye, as there are somewhere about
five hundred papers published during the week in London,
a single share of the 20,000 francs, said by the Siècle to be
paid to the numerous body of critics, cannot amount to
much ; but this only proves, of course, what an enormous
amount of praise can be purchased in London for less than a
sovereign. The French really imagine that everything is
purchasable in England. They believe that a person can
buy the succession to the throne, if he is but rich enough;
and that one can have a new moon any day by paying for it.
But there is one thing which not all the money in the world
could purchase, and that is, to induce the English to be
angry at the ridiculous nonsense the French writers so
humorously invent about them. The only way of paying
them off is by laughing at them. Evidently, the old proverb
ought to be altered to “Le Français, né malin, inventa l'Anglo-
phobie,” for the childish way in which they display it on every
little occasion, is much funnier than their “vaudeville.”

A TITLE FOR SIR PETER.
THE result of a great man's achievements is always the
acquisition of a name. This often is a really distinctive
appellation. PUBLIUs Scipio, from his victories over the
Carthaginians, was called AFRICANUs. JustiN was honoured
with the title of MARTYR. We have had a WILLIAM termed
the CoNQUERoR, and a HENRY entitled the DEFENDER of THE
FAITH. France boasts of her Louis LE DEBoxNAIRE, and
does not boast of her PHILIPPEEGALITE, nor, by the bye, will
she probably boast of his son. There was once a PETER

has as yet received no name in addition to simple LAURIE,
but who has done his very best to gain one. By his heroic
championship of sewers and cess-pools; by his gallant defence
of the vested interests of sinks; by his stedfast adherence to
the cause of mire; by his manful resistance to the scavenger
and the besom, SIR PETER LAURIE has fairly earned the
honourable alias of Srick-IN-THE-MUD.
Quite ag goob ag #Homep.
As there is a great scarcity of gold, we propose that some new scrip be
issued, to be called the Jenny Lind Scrip. This mighteasily be managed
by allowing the tickets for the Italian Opera House to be received as a
legal tender. Their value would of course depend upon the particular
place to which the holder of the scrip would be entitled admission. A
pit note would be less than one for the stalls, and a coupon for the
boxes would be higher than either. This scrip has already been cir-
culated to a very great extent in the Money Market, and in ſevery
instance has realised large sums. The holder of four Opera bonds for
private boxes, with six coupons to each, cleared £100 last week.
An issue of gallery debentures also would rectify the evil in the same
degree, though of course to a more moderate extent; for, being at a
very high premium, they would supersede for a time the use of gold.
We advise ministers to be careful with the Exchequer Bonds, which
only frighten people and agitate the market, and recommend them to
purchase largely in the LUMLEY Funds, which is the great circulating
medium at the present moment, and increase in value every day. If
they do not do this rapidly, they may depend upon it the EMPERoR
Nicholas will be before them in the market, and will be sending over
some £5,000,000, or some such Russian trifle, to buy up as much
JENNY LIND Scrip as possible, as being the very best stock in Europe
he can invest his money in. By the bye, there is a talk of a fresh
issue of half-farthings. We are confident there is no demand for them,
as ...; as there are so many English Opera-House debentures in the
market.
A GOOD BERTH.
ALL the new appointments have been filled up by Lords. What a
piece of extraordinary luck it is, there is such a thing in creation as a
peerage ' If there were no nobles in the world, England would be
without a government; for no one under a Baronet, it seems, is qualified
to be a minister. A plain Mr. has no title for office, though ennobled
by the highest ability; but an Earl, who has nothing to show but his
crest, has the best title—that of nobility. Look at the present govern-
ment ; how it is crowded with Viscounts, and Earls, and Right
Honourables 1 Every head in the cabinet has a coronet upon it; but
this is not to be wondered at, for the Whigs have always proved, when-
ever they had a chance, how strongly they were attached to a good
berth. “Lodge's Peerage” might appropriately be called “The Guide
to Government Situations.” -
IRISH ALL OVER.
THE Times has announced that the Irish circuits have been post-
poned for three months, on account of the prevalence of fever in Cork.
The judges, it seems, like everybody else in Ireland, will make any
thing an excuse for neglecting their business. We shall next have
Irish constables refusing to apprehend a thief on the plea that it is a
rainy morning. -

The sensation produced by the débùt of AMETHYst PIMLIco at the
| Court of the Sovereign, and in the salons of the beau-monde, was such as
has seldom been created by the appearance of any other beauty. The
men were raving with love, and the women with jealousy. Her eyes,
her beauty, her wit, her grace, her ton, caused a perfect fureur of
admiration or envy.
Introduced by the DUCHEss of FitzBATTLEAxE, along with her
Grace's daughters, the Ladies GwendoLINE and Gwinever Port-
CULLIs, the heiress's regal beauty quite flung her cousins' simple
charms into the shade, and blazed with a splendour which caused all
“minor lights” to twinkle faintly. Before a day the beau monde,
before a week even the vulgarians of the rest of the town, rang with
the fame of her beauty: and while the dandies and the beauties were
raving about her or tearing her to pieces in May Fair, even MRs.
DoBBs (who had been to the pit of the “Hoperer” in a green turban
and a crumpled yellow satin), talked about the great hairess to her
D. in Bloomsbury Square.
Crowds went to SQUAB AND Lynch's, in Long Acre, to examine the
carriages building for her, so faultless, so splendid, so quiet, so odiously
unostentatious and provokingly simple ! Besides the ancestral ser-
vices of argenterie and raisselle plate, contained in a hundred and seventy-
six plate chests at Messrs. CHILDs, RUMBLE and BRIggs prepared a
gold service, and GARRAway, of the Haymarket, a service of the
BENVENUTo CELLINI pattern, which were the admiration of all London.
Before a month it is a fact that the wretched haberdashers in the city
exhibited blue stocks, called “Heiress-killers, very chaste, two-and-
six;” long before that, the monde had rushed to MADAME CRINoLINE’s,
or sent couriers to MADAME MARABou, at Paris, so as to have copies
of her dresses; but, as the Mantuan bard observes, “Non cuivis contigit,”
-every foot cannot accommodate itself to the chaussure of CINDERELLA.
With all this splendour, this worship, this beauty ; with these
cheers following her, and these crowds at her feet, was AMETHYst
happy 2 Ah, no It is not under the necklace the most brilliant
that BRIgGs and RUMBLE can supply ; it is not in Lynch's best
| cushioned chariot that the heart is most at ease. “Que je me ruinerai,”
| says FRoNsAG in a letter to Bossuer, “si je sarais ou acheter le
| bonheur !”
With all her riches, with all her splendour, AMETHYst was
| wretched—wretched, because lonely ; wretched, because her loving
heart had nothing to cling to. Her splendid mansion was a convent;
no male person ever entered it, except FRANKLIN Fox, (who counted
for nothing,) and the Duchess's family, her kinsman old Lord
HUMPINgton, his friend old SIR John. Fogey, and her cousin, the
odious, odious BoroDINo.
The PRINCE DE BoroDINo declared openly that AMETHYst was
engaged to him. Criblé de dettes, it is no wonder that he should choose
such an opportunity to refaire sa fortune. He gave out that he would
kill any man who should cast an eye on the heiress, and the monster
kept his word. MAJoR GRIGG, of the Life Guards, had already
fallen by his hand at Ostend. The O'ToolE, who had met her on the
Rhine, had received a ball in his shoulder at Coblentz, and did not
care to resume so dangerous a courtship. Borodino could snuff a
bougie at a hundred-and-fifty yards. He could beat BERTRAND or
ALEXANDER DUMAs himself with the small sword ; he was the
dragon that watched this pomme d'or, and very few persons were now
inclined to face a champion si redoutable.
Over a Salmi d'escargot at the Coventry, the dandies whom we in-
heiress ; and her story was told by FRANKLIN Fox to Load Bagnigge,
who for a wonder was interested in the tale. Borodino's pretensions
were discussed, and the way in which the fair AMETHYst was con-
fined. Fitzbattleaxe House in Belgrave Square is—as everybody
knows—the next mansion to that occupied by AMETHYst. A com-
munication was made between the two houses. She never went out
except accompanied by the Duchess's guard, which it was impossible to
overcome.”
“Impossible ! Nothing's impossible,” said LoRD BAGNIGGE.
“I bet you what you like you don't get in,” said the
MARQUIs of MARTINGALE.
“I bet you a thousand ponies I stop a week in the heiress's house
troduced in our last volume were assembled, there talking of the Courts's for some time to come.
before the season's over,” LoRD BAGNigge replied with a yawn; and
the bet was registered with shouts of applause.
But it seemed as if the Fates had determined against LoRD
BAGNIGGE, for the very next day, riding in the Park, his horse fell
with him ; he was carried home to his house with a fractured limb and
a dislocated shoulder; and the doctor's bulletins pronounced him to
be in the most dangerous state.
MARTINGALE was a married man, and there was no danger of his
riding by the FITzBATTLEAxE carriage. A fortnight after the above
|events, his Lordship was prancing by her Grace's great family coach,
and chattering with LADY Gwinever about the strange wager.
“Do you know what a poney is, LADY Gwinever ?” he asked.
| Her Ladyship said yes; she had a cream-coloured one at Castle
Barbican ; and stared when Lord MARTINGALE announced that he
should soon have a thousand ponies, worth five-and-twenty pounds
each, which were all now kept at Coutts's. Then he explained the
circumstances of the bet with BAGNIggs. Parliament was to adjourn
in ten days; the season would be over ; BAGNigge was lying ill chez
|lui; and the five-and-twenty thousand were irrecoverably his. And
|he vowed he would buy Lond Bisnacle's yacht—crew, captain, guns,
and all.
On returning home that night from LADY Polkmore's, MARTIN-
|GALE found among the many billets upon the gold plateau in his anti-
| chambre, the following brief one, which made him start:-
“DEAR MARTINGALE,-Don't be too sure of BINNAcLE's yacht. There
are still ten days before the season is over; and my ponies may lie at
“Yours,
“BAGNIGGE.”
“P.S.. I write with my left hand; for my right is still splintered up
from that confounded fall.” .

PUNCH'S PRACTICE CASES.
WATson ex parte DUGGIN ats. GREAVEs.
GREAves had gone with instructions to WATson to draw a bill of
foreclosure. Whereupon Duggin, clerk to WATson, executed a pro-
visional foreclosure at once by shutting the outer door, and refusing to
execute a release until GREAves had given him a fee. GREAVEs having
a dinner in reversion, and being unwilling to go in as the remainder-
man, wished to call upon a casual ejector (a policeman), but DUGGIN
held GREAves in possession by the skirt of his coat, who was thus
seised in tail. DUGGIN having refused to execute a release, unless he
was put in possession of the fee, GREAVEs consented to surrender two-
and-sixpence as a base fee, and the parties now came before the Court
for further directions.
ARNoLD, C. J.-I scarcely see how we can interfere. The question
for us is, in fact, whether an attorney can be considered assets in the
hands of the clerk of a conveyancer. It is clear that if the seisure had
been by the vest, a sort of vested interest would have been established;
but after all, had the attorney's coat been torn off his back, he would
have remained as a mere nudum pactum for the benefit of the clerk of
the conveyancer.
HARDwick, J.-This seems rather a matter for the Prize Court than
for us, because there was a capture of the clearest kind, and the clerk,
who was in fact an underwriter, can scarcely be allowed to carry
assurance to the length he would have done had he been permitted.
There was undoubtedly a ne exeat served upon the attorney, who had
a perfect right to demur ; but he had his remedy by avoiding the entry,
which he had better do for the future.
Everything refused.

Musical Intelligence.
SoME curiosity has been excited in the European mind—we allude:
of course, to our readers—on the subject of HERR Schwartz, whose
name has been introduced into our paper on one or two occasions.
Schwartz is an ex-member of Coles's Rheumatic Band, consisting, of
course of wind instruments, which he quitted in consequence of the
objection he felt to the blowing of hot and cold; to which, as a member of
the Rheumatic Band, he was continually liable. The HERR has com-
menced a series of steam-boat Séances, and is arranging a funnel Fan-
tasia, as well as a paddle-box Polka, in commemoration of the forth-
coming Festa di Rosherville.
SUBSTITUTE FOR POTATOES.
Sever AL persons have been eating haricot beans as a substitute for
potatoes. We have tried these beans, and consider them quite a stable
dish ; but we must confess, that of all haricots we prefer haricot
mutton.
SALUBRITY OF SMITHFIELD.
THERE is an old saying, that every one eats a peck of dirt in the
course of his life; but a calculation of how much dirt one drinks—held
in solution in Thames water—has, we believe, never been completed.
The friends of Smithfield Market are, no doubt, not merely reconciled
to the sort of fare which we all are said to partake of rather largely,
but they appear to delight in the consumption, as if, on the principle of
similia similibus, a large accession of mundane dirt to human clay were
greatly to be desired. On the supposition that there is something sa-
lubrious in filth, we may account for the allegation as to the whole-
someness of Smithfield Market.
The purity of the water in the vicinity has been much talked about,
and we have therefore caused a drop of it to be magnified and analysed.
The accompanying section will show the parts of which the Smithfield
fluid is composed. It will be seen that Mammon is one of the chief
ingredients, though Folly forms no inconsiderable portion of the dis-
gusting mixture. We are, however, preparing a patent filter, which, by
applying the principle of very hard pressure, will, we trust, have the
effect of purifying even Smithfield from the foulness with which it is
at present encumbered.
A COLLECTOR OF CURIOSITIES.
AN enthusiast has offered £100 reward to any one who will produce
a play-bill which contains the printed proof of an English piece being
performed, or an English actor ever playing an English character, by
royal command of HER MAJESTY,-dramas for elephants and hyenas, of
course, excepted. We think the generous enthusiast is in a fair
way of winning the £100 himself, for if there ever was such a
curious document in the world, every impression must have been
bought up long ago, and must be now, from its extreme rarity, at a
much higher premium than £100. He may go through the process of
removing his proffered reward from his right into his left pocket, and
can repeat the transfer with the greatest security, as often as he is in
want, in this warm weather, of a cool hundred. We are afraid the par-
ticular printer's-ink has not yet been invented which is to strike off
the identical play-bill our enthusiast is dying to possess in order to
enrich his cabinet of curiosities.
Sauve qui Peut.
THE Chamber of Deputies have thrown out the proposition for an
uniform rate of postage, proposed on Rowland HILL's plan. We thought
the French were such a military nation that they would have rushed into
anything that was uniform; but it seems that the charge made was so
strong, that they could not meet it. After all, we must not blame their
want of courage, for the uniform in question was a British one.

THE SUN SNUFFED OUT.
The latest invention is to take photographic portraits by means of a
lighted candle. We must say the dip has been burning at both ends
lately. It was only the other day that the dip of the magnetic needle
was discovered, and now it breaks out in a new light and takes
portraits with a lucifer match. Henceforth what will be the R.A.s of
the Academy, compared to those of a rushlight SIR MARTIN SHEE
will be thrown into the shade, WINTERHALTER will be sent to the wall,
and the talented Pickersgill will be obliged to hold the candle to
PRINCE ALBERT, whenever his Royal Highness burns for another
portrait.
We cannot help thinking that His Royal Highness will be quite
dazzled, almost blinded by this new invention, for every little rapin
of a boy, who is in command of a short six, and every loyal engraver
who can handle a long four, will be rushing to the Palace to ask for

frame-work of guttering candles, like those we see in the French

THE NEW COUNTY COURTS ACT.
This Act, which was to serve as a sort of parcels delivery for
bringing justice home to every man's door, is all very well in theory;
but the sort of justice that is being brought home to the door seems, in
nine cases out of ten, to be scarcely worth the house-room it would
occupy. In consequence of some dissatisfaction that has been expressed
with the decisions, we understand that arrangements have been made
by which variety will be secured, and all tastes accommodated. There
are to be, in future, two or three different decisions on the same point,
so hat any one objecting to one mode of settling a difficulty may, by
raising the same question again, get a decision of an exactly opposite
character. We have not heard whether the same judge will give the
| public the benefit of this agreeable alternation in a single Court, or
whether the practice will be coufined, as at present, to the contradiction
of the judgment of one Court by the judgment of another. By the
existing arrangement every variety of justice may be had by resorting
to a sufficient number of tribunals ; but the tendency of the practice
appears to be towards a system by which the same judge will contradict
himself as well as his fellow functionaries; and thus, a client, without
going out of one Court, can have the same matter decided in ways quite
opposite to each other.
THE LAST OF THE ETHIOPIANS.
THE Ethiopian Mania is, at last, upon the wane; and, since the an-
nouncement of the final nights of the original band, soot has fallen at
lies. 40 per cent... while lamp-black is a drug, and burnt cork has lost all
its buoyancy. Now that the rage for black vocalists is just over, we may
look for a healthier complexion in the aspect of public amusement ;
and we shall not have so many performers announcing themselves as
attractions to the world, on what the lawyers would call a merely
“colourable” pretext. Hitherto, the public would seem to have been
as much in the dark as the Ethiopians themselves; for pretenders have
been tolerated, if they only had the face to pass themselves off as
deserving of patronage.
The original introducers of this black spot upon public taste, have
been presenting people with their portraits, in order that a record may
be preserved of one of the most extraordinary features in the history
of gullibility. We find that each visitor to the St. James's has been
allowed the option of taking a portrait, either plain or coloured—that
is to say, dyed in the ink from which he has derived his income—of
the individual serenader taking his benefit.
We regret that we were not consulted as
to the means of having
“Two faces under one hood,”
by getting the double effect of the Ethi-
opian and the European in the same
picture. The annexed truly artistic
sketch, from the paint-brush and scrub-
hing-brush of a picture-cleaner in the
National Gallery, will convey a capital
idea of our method of giving two like- |
nesses in one, by preserving, on the same
canvass, the dark and the bright side of
these Ethiopians, who have so long con-
tributed to the public amusement, and—
no doubt—to their own emolument.
Burdens on Property.
ON French railways, previous to the opening of any viaduct,
enormous weights are passed over it to test its strength. Should this
practice ever be adopted in England, we recommend for the purpose
MR. DisrAELI's Election Addresses. If the viaduct does not give way
under one of them, before it has got half-way through it, it may be
taken for granted it will bear any weight in the world.

rooms in the new Houses of Parliament.

CoLoREL SIBTHORPE's objections against Railways have never been
published. We hasten, out of justice to our facetious Member, to
supply the omission :- -
“I dislike railways, because they cut up the country.
“I hate them, because they are the greatest levellers in the world.
“I object to them, because I object to any one running through my
property excepting myself. -
“I have an especial aversion to tunnels, as I do not see upon what
grounds England has to be bored by them.
“My antipathy against the smoke cannot be described in colours
black enough. The prettiest spots on the face of the country have
been rubbed out by the new lines that have been run across it, and its
most lovely, features buried under a heap of cinders, which every
railway carries in its train, for all the world like the train of CINDERELLA.
In fact, if railways are allowed to run much longer, England will soon
be reduced to a state of ashes, and will have to be swept twice a year,
or else it will ultimately disappear from the surface of the globe.
“I have the greatest dislike against directors, guards, policemen, and
every one connected with railways. I think a stoker will go any
lengths to attain his end ; and I am of opinion that every railway
engine is more or less an engine of destruction, and that nothing will
stop it when once it has made up its boiler to go a certain distance.

feel disposed to state them just at present.

SEveRAL correspondents have written to us to know, whether we
can give any geographical particulars of the Mons Jullien, which is
now being placarded all over the metropolis. In these days of decided
tendency to make a mountain out of a molehill, the appearance of a
Mons with the name of Jullien may be partly accounted for.
cannot give any very elaborate description of this Mons; but we
understand it is at present to be, seen somewhere in the neigh-
bourhood of the Surrey Hills, an imaginary range of mountains
that are said to be visible from the window of every attic in the
metropolis, if we are to believe, the word of every lodging-letting
landlord or landlady. The Mons Jullien has a dark summit rising
over a front of whiteness equal to that of Mont Blanc. The longi-
tude of the Mons is nothing very considerable, but the latitude
allowed to the Mons is sometimes really astonishing. The Mons
Jullien would have saved MAhom ET a good deal of trouble had he
been disinclined to go to the mountain, for the mountain would—for a
consideration—have at any time gone to MAHOMET.

PELL anticipates the discovery of some new effects on his peculiar

its treatment of the bones, as exemplified in the great Crushing Case.

HINTS TO CANVASSERS.
The difficulty of a personal canvass has frequently been alleged as
an excuse for omitting this ceremony, by individuals offering themselves
as candidates for Parliament. We think the compliment of a call ºn
every elector can just as well be paid by a man's portrait as by himself.
The subjoined sketch exemplifies the idea to which we beg to direct
the attention of would-be Members of Parliament.
PUNCH'S GUIDE TO FASHIONABLE DANCING.
Resus CITATION OF THE DANCE.
A LITTLE while ago the dance was apparently on its last legs, and
only one form of it continued in full vigour, namely, that quick suc-
cession of rapid steps, comprising the interminable dance which some
people are always leading their creditors. To get up a quadrille used
to require as much canvassing and soliciting among the constituents
as an election for a member of Parliament. The hostess at a soirée
intended to be dansante was compelled to ask the suffrages of those
around her with the most persuasive eloquence, in order to return a
sufficient number of members for getting through the usual measures.
Even then the apathy exhibited was of the most freezing character,
and the parties paired off with languid listlessness. This state of
things has been succeeded by another totally different. The movement
has reached the ball-room, the waltz has taken a favourable turn
a-head, and the legs now stand up for a freedom of action which they
had lately denied themselves. The constituents of a quadrille, instead
of waiting for entreaties before they would sluggishly exercise the
Terpsichorean franchise, now rush eagerly to the pol—ka, and use the
elective privilege in the choice of partners.
In searching for the causes of the revolution thus effected, we find
the Polka at the bottom, as well as at the top of every one of them.
The Polka has broken down the old aristocratic barriers of the formal
Quadrille, and opened the doors of the dance to all, by removing its old
limits. The Quadrille, though favourable to the formation of sets, was
opposed to that broad and universal spirit of equality which the Polka
encourages. It is true that, like other free institutions, the Polka has
sometimes been abused, and carried to an objectionable extent; but, on
the whole, the freedom it has introduced into the ball-room has not
been destructive of order or propriety.
Though the dance has, of late years, assumed more of character than
it formerly possessed, we do not mean to say that the steps and figures
of the stage can be, with propriety, introduced into the salon. Want
of space would interfere to mar the buoyancy and beauty of those
bounds which tell so well on the dramatic boards ; for a CERIto-like
movement in a ball-room would carry the executant from the door to
the fire-place, or from the wall to the window at a jump, causing a
routing of the occupants of the rout seats to an extent that would be
far from agreeable. The proceedings that are eulogised as fawn-like when
stances, a complete stop to the progress of industry.
seen upon the stage, would be sadly de trop at a wire, and the gambois
of the gazelle, though charming when exhibited in an ample space,
would be inconvenient amongst the handing round of refreshments in
glass and china-ware. Even the Highland Fling, which is compara-
tively quiet at the theatre, would never do in private life, for the
Hºnºr must not be allowed to have his fling amidst a private
curcie.
The College Hornpipe is well enough at a noisy assembly of under-
graduates, but not the most experienced master of the Terpsichorean
art could tone it down so as to adapt it to the limits of a soirée
dansante. Who but BARon NATHAN would attempt the Truandaise
amid the intricacies of tea-trays, a collision with which might furnish
a tambourine accompaniment far more striking than appropriate *
Who would attempt the pas de fascination in Grosvenor Place, or give
the gambols of a Gitana through a first floor—by courtesy called a suite
—in Baker Street 2 What would the Cachucha be in Cadogan Place,
or how would the Sylphide's flights up and down chimneys be carried
out in every-day life, to say nothing of the direct violation of the Act
against climbing-boys, among which—as masculine means feminine in
legislative language—climbing-girls are of course included ? Our Guide
to Fashionable Dancing will therefore not teach the young idea how to
shoot up into the air like our friend SHALLABALLAH from his box; nor
will it give lessons for bounding about upon one leg, as if human
beings were unipeds and not bipeds; but we shall endeavour to guide
the steps of our readers in the right direction. By placing their feet
in our hands they will be perfectly safe, and will never befound tripping.
THE USE OF TEMPLE BAR.
A Most unexpected advantage has recently been discovered in
Temple Bar, by its being found adapted to a purpose which the archi-
tect could never have ventured to contemplate. For the last few years
it has been good for little more than to serve as an outpost to the
paviours, by aiding them in blocking up the thoroughfares; or rather,
it might be regarded as a sort of advanced piquette-appropriately
placed near Picket Street—to keep off the carriages and cabs that
might have otherwise driven down upon the breast-works being con-
tinually thrown up by the gas-work people, or the emissaries from a
hostile water company, which is so frequently in possession of some of H.
the principal passes in the metropolis.
The important fact has, however, at last been brought to light, that
Temple Bar is serviceable as a kind of fortress to defend the city against
the invasion of those gigantic advertising vans, that put, in many in-
| ||

Happily, puffing
has reached such an enormous height as to have out-grown the very
gaps through which it would have forced itself, and it has thus
become the victim of its own enormity. We beg to propose to the
civic authorities that the Bar should be regularly manned with a small
reserve of policemen, empowered to act against an invader in the shape
of a monster van, and prevent the possibility of a siege becoming suc-
cessful. While the advertiser is attacking the city in the van, a corps
of the Civic Raw Lobstery could rush round to the rear, and might
easily turn the flanks of the horse, or cause the foe to wheel sharp
round and surrender at discretion.

HALE! HALE –ALL HALE |
Every one knows that Hail is in its nature a fluid that derives substance from its excessive
coolness; and the clerical HALE, whose career illustrates the fact that “it never rains but it
pours,” is a living proof of extreme coolness giving substance to an otherwise somewhat
insignificant particle. - -

excused for likening him to an object of art, with which most of our readers are, no doubt,

He is a sort of Reverend Seven in One—an article shaped like an apple, but which,

an involuntary exclamation of “Go it my pippin-1” escapes our lips as we find a succession
of pippins one after the other present themselves. . Thus, in examining one of the largest
specimens of the fruits of church patronage, which looks sufficient of itself to satisfy and
extravagant appetite, we find a great deal of “that within which passeth show;" for, as we

BRASS-BAND SERENADERS.
THE Daily News informs us that a party of
sixteen gentlemen, members of the German Vocal
Club, repaired to Miss LIND's residence at
Brompton, and executed several beautiful sere-
made airs in a very superior and musician-like
manner. Our contemporary must be mistaken.
These gentlemen were surely not vocalists, but
instrumental performers; and there must have
been much brass even in the band that could
presume to play in JENNY LIND's hearing. To
give JENNY LINo music, is pretty much like pre-
tending to make jokes for the amusement of
Punch, or carrying coals to Newcastle. We would
recommend JENNY LINo-to keep a policeman
on her premises, who would compel any indi-
viduals indulging themselves in airs under her
window, to perform the best movement they could
possibly be capable of that of moving on.
Zoological -ntelligence.
THE recent death of the elephant at the Zoo-
logical Gardens in the Regent's Park, has caused
a vacancy at that establishment which will not
be filled up very easily. The late elephant was
highly respected by all the fellows of the Society.
He has left no property behind him, for his trunk
has been diligently searched, and nothing what-
ever has been found in it. We are told that
there are two or three candidates already in the
field, with the view of offering themselves to fill
up the gap occasioned by the demise of the great
creature whose decease has recently happened.
QBut Committee on tijº (Tījāmtg) Nabigation ſlab 8.
WHILE the House of Commons has its Committee sitting on the
General Navigation Laws of the country, we have issued our com-
mission to inquire into the more limited, but yet vitally important
subject of these laws, as they affect the Thames, its craft, and the
persons engaged on board of them.
The most valuable results have been arrived at in the course of the
inquiry, as may be seen from the subjoined extracts from the mass of
evidence.
aware of the existence of laws for the Thames navigation.
John Jiggers, Captain of the Minnow half-penny steamer, examined—Is
Takes the
right-hand going down, and the left coming up. Understands the prin-
ciples of navigation; means by them the signs for “Back her,” “Ease
her,” “Stop her.” Has been in the habit of running down funnies, occa-
sionally. Can't see how it can be helped. It’s no use starboarding or
porting the helmuto get out of their way. They always do what you
do. Suppose it's the desire of imitation, because they naturally think
you must be right. Believes the navigation might be improved by
taking away the Bridges; this would give increased employment to
the steam-boats in conveying people across, and save the time now spent
in lowering funnels. Thinks the increased use of steam-boats the
great thing to be desired. ... Does not consider half-penny steamers
unsafe, except in holiday times. They may be rather crowded on
Easter-week and about Whitsuntide. If people go a pleasuring, thinks
they like a crowd going down the river. Disapproves of any inter-
ference with the numbers to be carried. . It would be contrary to the
principle of self-government to confine them. Never takes more than
he has standing room for. , SIR PETER LAURIE is in the habit of going
by his boat. Has heard him talk about self-government.
Thomas Drysalter examined.—Is a clerk in an establishment in
Thames Street. Is a member of several boating clubs. Spends his
holidays on the water. Flatters himself he knows the river. Star-
board and larboard are words used on the river. Has heard them often
used on board the steamers, and has used them himself. Does not
attach distinct ideas to them, but steers according to the circumstances
of the case. Has not been run down lately. Cannot swim. Battersea
Reach is considered dangerous when the wind is fresh. Perhaps it
may be dangerous when the oarsmen are fresh also. It is a law of the
river to get drunk at Avis's after a boat-race. Considers that the great
thing to be desired is the doing away with the steamboats ; they cause
a swell, and are very dangerous to rowing boats. The directions
given from them are seldom intelligible. Would have them kept to
the middle of the river, like omnibuses. The funnies and gigs should
be considered as foot-passengers. Has his life insured in the Pelican.
Did not mention that he was in the habit of going on the river when
he effected the insurance.
James Mudlark, examined.—Is a waterman. Gets his living by going
off to gents. that go overboard. Has picked up a tidy lot. Finds they
can't often get their hands into their pockets when out of the water.
Thinks a material that won't shrink should be used for boating-
trowsers. Steamers ought to be encouraged. Many honest men, like
himself, would lose their bread if it warn’t for the steamers. Is sorry
to say they are getting more cautious. Hasn't had a jolly good accident
these six weeks. Means, by a jolly good accident, an eight run down,
when the gents. are in liquor, and pay handsomely: or a pleasure-boat
capsized, with females on board. Always makes a point of landing
females first. Doesn't see what is to become of him if people learn to
swim. Life-preservers are all humbug. Would sooner trust to a
waterman himself.
Mir-ABILE DICTU.
A FRENCH paper, Le Bien Public, tells us that there has been lately
seen twice, a splendidº mirage at Macon... We, don't know what our
Gallic contemporary may call a splendid mirage, but SIR PETER
LAURIE is ready to lay a bet that nothing in France can equal the
mir(e)age in the neighbourhood of Smithfield Market. (Oh /)

A NOTE FoR PERSONs GOING ABROAD.
THE best passport, after all, is an English Bank-note. It is very
portable, and is current everywhere, being perfectly understood alk
over the Continent. It will admit the bearer into places he would
otherwise have no means of seeing, and will carry him much further than
a common passport. It does not require to be viséd, though there is a
difficulty sometimes, when a traveller is a long way from home, in
getting it renewed. These passports can be procured at any time from
the Bank of England; but any generous “Governor” has the privilege
to grant them. . This privilege, however, is rarely abused by them; and
an absent son, who is studying at a German University, and hap-
pens to have lost his passport, often experiences, to his cost, very
great difficulty in procuring a fresh one. Travellers cannot be suffi-
ciently cautioned against parting with a passport of this valuable
nature ; for when once it has gone out of their hands, especially at a
French hotel, they may be sure they will never see it again. . Young
gentlemen should likewise be careful not to rely too much upon the
respectability of this passport ; for, no matter how high the stamp of
it may be, still, they will find it worth nothing, and that they will be
stopt for some time on their journey, if they venture, when abroad, to
rush into those extravagant excesses which a Bank-note is allowed by
indulgent magistrates sometimes to cover in their own country.

PUNCH'S PRIZE NOWELISTS.
LORDS AND LIVERIES.
BY THE AUTHOREss of “DUREs AND DEJEUNERs,” “HEARTS AND
DIAMONDs,” “MARCHIONESSES AND MILLINERs,” ETC. ETC.
THE tall footman, number four, who had come in the place of John,
cashiered (for want of proper mollets, and because his hair did not take
powder well), had given great satisfaction to the under-butler, who
reported well of him to his chief, who had mentioned his name with
praise to the house-steward. He was so good-looking and well-spoken
a young man, that the ladies in the housekeeper's room deigned to
notice him more than once; nor was his popularity diminished on
account of a quarrel in which he engaged with MonsLEUR ANATole,
the enormous Walloon chasseur, who was one day found embracing Miss
FLOUNCY, who waited on AMETHYst's own maid. The very instant
Miss FLOUNCY saw MR. JEAMEs entering the Servants' Hall, where
MonsLEUR ANATole was engaged in “aggravating” her, Miss Flouncy
screamed – at the next moment the Belgian giant lay sprawling
upon the carpet—and JEAMEs, standing over him, assumed so terrible
a look, that the chasseur declined any further combat. The victory
was made known to the house-steward himself, who, being a little
partial to Miss FLouncy herself, complimented JEAMEs on his
valour, and poured out a glass of Madeira in his own room.
Who was JEAMEs He had come recommended by the BAGNIGGE
people. He had lived, he said, in that family two years. “But where
there was no ladies,” he said, “a gentleman's hand was spiled for
service ; ” and JEAMEs's was a very delicate hand; Miss Flouncy
admired it very much, and of course he did not defile it by menial service;
he had in a young man who called him “Sir,” and did all the coarse
work ; and JEAMEs read the morning paper to the ladies; not spell-
ingly and with hesitation, as many gentlemen do, but easily and
elegantly, speaking off the longest words without a moment's difficulty.
He could speak French, too, Miss Flouncy found, who was studying
it under MADEMoisellE GRANDE, fille-de-chambre de confiance; for
when she said to him “Polly roo Fransy, MUNSEER JEAMEs 2" he
replied readily, “We, Mademaselle, j'ay passay boco de tong a Parry.

as he stood before her, the day after he had saved Miss AMETHYst,
when the horses had run away with her in the Park :
Poor Flouncy, poor Flouncy 1 JEAMEs had been but a week in
AMETHYST's service, and already the gentle heart of the washing-girl
was irrecoverably gone Poor Flouncy poor Flouncy he thought
not of thee,
It happened thus. Miss AMETHYST being engaged to drive with
her cousin the Prince in his phaeton, her own carriage was sent into
the Park simply with her companion, who had charge of her little
Fido, the dearest little spaniel in the world. JEAMEs and FREDERICK
were behind the carriage with their long sticks and neat dark liveries;
the horses were worth a thousand guineas each, the coachman a late
Lieutenant-Colonel of cavalry: the whole ring did not boast a more
elegant turn-out.
The Prince drove his curricle, and had charge of his belle cousine.
It may have been the red fezzes in the carriage of the Turkish
ambassador which frightened the Prince's greys, or MRs. CHAM-
PIGNON's new yellow liveries, which were 'flaunting in the Park, or
hideous LADY GoRGon’s preternatural ugliness, who passed in a low
poney-carriage at the time, or the Prince's own want of skill, finally;
but certain it is that the horses took fright, dashed wildly along the
mile, scattered equipages, piétons, dandies' cabs, and Snobs' pheaytons.
AMETHYST was screaming ; and the Prince, deadly pale, had lost all
presence of mind, as the curricle came rushing by the spot where
Miss AMETHYst's carriage stood.
“I’m blest,” FREDERICK exclaimed to his companion, “if it ain't
the Prince a drivin our Missis : They'll be in the Serpingtine, or
dashed to pieces, if they don't mind;” and the runaway steeds at this
instant came upon them as a whirlwind.
But if those steeds ran at whirlwind pace, JEAMEs was swifter.
To jump from behind, to bound after the rocking, reeling curricle, to
jump into it, aided by the long stick which he carried and used as a
leaping-pole, and to seize the reins out of the hands of the miserable
BoRoDINo, who shrieked piteously as the dauntless valet leapt on his
toes and into his seat, was the work of an instant. In a few minutes
the mad, swaying rush of the horses was reduced to a swift but steady
gallop; presently into a canter, then a trot; until finally they pulled up
smoking and trembling, but quite quiet, by the side of AMETHYst's
carriage, which came up at a rapid pace.
“Give me the reins, malappris! tu m'écrases les cors, manant "yelled
the frantic nobleman, writhing underneath the intrepid charioteer.
“Tant pis pour toi, migaud,” was the reply. The lovely AMETHYst of
course had fainted; but she recovered as she was placed in her car-
riage, and rewarded her preserver with a celestial smile.
The rage, the fury, the maledictions of BoroDINo, as he saw
the latter—a liveried menial–stoop gracefully forward and kiss
AMETHYST’s hand, may be imagined rather than described. But
JEAMEs heeded not his curses. Having placed his adored mistress in
the carriage, he calmly resumed his station behind. Passion or danger
seemed to have no impression upon that pale marble face.
Bokodino went home furious; nor was his rage diminished, when, on
coming to dinner that day, a recherché banquet served in the Frangi-
pane best style, and requesting a supply of a purée à la bisque aur
€crérisses, the clumsy attendant who served him let fall the assiette of
termeille ciselé, with its scalding contents, over the Prince's chin, his
Mechlin jabot, and the grand cordon of the Legion of Honour which
he wore.
“Infäme,” howled BoroDINo, “tu l'as fait exprest"
“Oui, je l'ai fait expres,” said the man, with the most perfect Parisian
accent. It was JEAMEs.
Such insolence of course could not be passed unnoticed even after
the morning's service, and he was chasséd on the spot. He had been
but a week in the house.
The next month the newspapers contained a paragraph which may
possibly elucidate the above mystery, and to the following effect :—
“Singular Wager.—One night, at the end of last season, the young and
eccentric EARL of B–GN—GGE laid a wager of twenty-five thousand
pounds with a broken sporting patrician, the dashing MARQUIs of
M—RT-NG—LE, that he would pass a week under the roof of a
celebrated and lovely young heiress, who lives not a hundred miles
from B–LGR–VE SQU—RE. The bet having been made, the Earl
pretended an illness, and having taken lessons from one of his lordship's
own footmen (MR. JAMEs PLUsh, whose name he also borrowed) in
‘the mysteries of the profession,’ actually succeeded in making an entry
into Miss P-ML–co's mansion, where he stopped one week exactly ;
having time to win his bet, and to save the life of the lady, whom we

THE LEPUS VASTATOR.
CoNSIDERABLE doubt exists whether the aphis, which is said to produce
the potato-blight, is a true vastator; but as to the fact that the Lepus
is a genuine vastator, or devastator, there is no mistake. The ravages
which it commits upon young wheat, clover, and turnips, are enormous,
as the farmer, whose lands are unfortunately infested by it, can testify
to his cost. There are two varieties of the Lepus vastator; one com-
monly known as the Hare, Lepus timidus ; the other, Lepus cuniculus, as
the Rabbit or Coney. These creatures require no microscope to dis-
tinguish them, being perfectly visible by the naked eye, with which a
farmer can often count as many as a hundred of them in a single field
of clover, wherein, in a few days afterwards, there remains very little
clover to be seen. They constitute a perfect scourge to agriculture, the
THE POWER OF ROYALTY.
THE amount of good that Royalty can effect in this country is
astonishing—only less astonishing than that which it has yet to do.
A Royal nod, wink, word, scratch of the pen, can abate a nuisance or
abolish a wrong. Evil is still eradicable by the Royal touch. We are
informed, by the United Service Gazette, of a wonderful cure of one of the
many forms of it, wrought—not, indeed, by the Sovereign, but—by a
Prince of the Blood. The vice of gambling was prevalent in the Hiber-
nian United Service Club, where it had led to the ruin of several officers.
PRINCE GEORGE of CAMBRIDGE—to his honour beitspoken—intimated
his intention of withdrawing his name from the Club's books, unless
the practice were discontinued. His Royal Highness had but to speak
the word. The committee of the Club promptly acceded to his wishes,
and have determined to discountenance gambling within its walls to
their utmost power. Such virtue having been proved to reside in a
mere Prince, what may we now expect from Majesty herself? Perhaps
the gratification of reading, in our contemporaries, announcements such
as the following:—
“The QUEEN, desirous, it is understood, of reviving the taste among
her subjects for the higher order of the Drama, has graciously inti-
mated her desire to MR. BENJAMIN WEBstER, of the Haymarket, that
he should take measures for the production, at his theatre, of a five-act
play; which, on its appearance, she has further been graciously
pleased to promise to honour with her presence. We hope and trust
that our dramatists will zealously bestir themselves to produce a per-
formance that may be worthy of the attention of their Sovereign.”
“HER Most GRAcious MAJESTY has commanded the Professors of
the Royal Academy of Music to make a selection of the most proficient
vocalists among their pupils, who are to have the honour of singing at
HER MAJESTY's concerts. The QUEEN, we are informed, has deter-
mined on this step, in order to try whether anything but Royal
encouragement is wanting to render native talent in all-respects equal
to that of foreigners. We are very sanguine as to the success of the
experiment.”
“We are authorised in stating that it is the express command of the
Sovereign that no Irish landlord shall be presented at Court, or presume
to intrude into her gracious presence, who does not, at least during six
months of the year, reside on his own estates.”
“His Royal HighNEss PRINCE ALBERT, actuated no less by his
personal feelings than by those of his august consort, has announced
his determination to speak to no nobleman or gentleman of whom his
tenants complain for preserving game.”
The monarchy of England is, in one sense, limited. Of course it
cannot—and never did—harm. For beneficial purposes, however, its
will is absolute law ; and now that Royalty knows the extent of its
sphere of usefulness—which may be defined a circle with no end to
its diameter—it will no doubt exert itself therein indefinitely.

profuse rate. It has been laid on everywhere
in the metropolis, but nowhere so liberally as
on the Regent Street Arcade, where an open-
ing has been made through the roof to give
the water every facility of coming in. The
consequence is, a series of the most popular
aquatic fetes has been given during the last
week. The Beadle on one occasion paddled
backwards and forwards in a most elegant
gondola, and one or two Swans from EDGAR's
enlivened considerably the watery scene. It is
intended, as long as there is the present depth
of water in the Arcade, toget up a few rowing
matches, and the left-hand Beadle has challenged the right-hand

We do not wonder, with these testimonies to its effects, to hear that
a compºny is to be at once “Established to supply the public with an
ounce of Ether, direct from Apothecaries' Hall, and a bladder.”
THE GREAT CAxton MEETING.
PUNCH must of course sympathise from the bottom of his heart—
drop in at the |aye, from the very soles of his feet—in the proposition for a monu-
chemists', to call ment to CAxton ; and he was therefore present at a meeting held a

corroborating the fact, and describing the effects
of the new stimulant.

“SIR,--I have imbibed Ether, and shall con-

for immortality, which I confidently expect to do

aware I have been the butt of his malignant criticism for years.)

and weekly papers.
“Third stage.—Produced an historical picture, 25 feet by 15, repre-
senting the ‘Discovery of the dead body of Harold after the

Commissioners, and was dragged home by the populace in my own

by a surprising imitation of HERR von JoEL, and a general challenge

order of eloquence, which keeps a purpose back instead of helping it
forward.
The report given in all the papers was, of course, very far from
literal, but we are fortunately enabled to reproduce some of its most
salient points, and particularly a few of those which were embodied in
the speech of our old friend DR. BUCKLAND, of Megatherium notoriety.
The following is a correct summary of his speech relative to CAxton ;
from which it will be seen—as in the old Hamlet story—the name of
CAxton was almost entirely omitted:—
DR. BucKLAND began by paying a compliment to the chairman,
LoRD MoRPETH, and took the opportunity of going into the early history
of the Woods and Forests. DR. BUCKLAND then struck out into Swallow
Street, and suggested to everybody, that if anybody had walked down
Swallow Street a hundred years ago, nobody would know Swallow
Street again in its present altered condition. (Nothing said of
CAxton.) DR. BUCKLAND then took a turn into Vigo Lane, strolling
leisurely along Glasshouse Street, asking the audience to accompany
him to the station-house in Vine Street. (CAxton still smothered in
antiquarian small-talk.) DR. BUCKLAND then lingered over ARCH-
Bishop TENyson's pump, dropped into NEwMAN's stable-yard, and took
a few gigantic strides along MAJoR FAUBERT's passage. “I now
come,” said DR. BUCKLAND–after he had been loitering in Swallow
Street for at least half an hour—“I now come to that great invention,
the invention of printing.” (A feeling of “Ah, now we shall have it at
last !” was by this time pretty general.) DR. BUCKLAND proceeded to
say that there had lately been discovered somewhere—no matter
where; perhaps in some private mare's nest of his own—two wonderful
birds, called by the name of Dinornis, having bodies half the size of an
ostrich, and legs twice the length of a camel. (Here there was a sort
of stare, as much as to say, “What is CAxton to these birds, or they to
CAxton 2") DR. BUCKLAND proceeded to enlarge a good deal on
these birds, sometimes adding a yard or two to their legs, until at
last he seemed to come to the point, or at least within a circuit of
some few miles round it, by intimating that the invention of printing
would communicate—what mighty fact do you think?—the discovery
of these two birds to the antipodes / /
No doubt the object was very much advanced by the subscriptions,
if there were any ; but the talk will, we fear, be found rather an
impediment, as it is calculated to frighten people away from taking
part in a matter which serves as a peg to hang up such heavy stuff
as DR. BUCKLAND's eloquence.
THE TRUE BRITISH SAILOR 1
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, on hoisting his flag at Portsmouth, has issued
an address worthy of T. P. Cooke and the glorious days of the British
Navy at the Surrey. Who can read the following inspiriting “bit of
fat” (as it would be called in the theatre) without feeling the liveliest
inclination to bless his dear eyes, and to bid any lubber “avast,” who
may not share his enthusiasm —
“Any young fellows who are fond of fun had better rally round the Old Commodore,
whose bit of blue flies on board of her, and who is looking out for squalls.”
SIR CHARLEs has written a letter to MR. T. P. CookE, inviting him
on board the flag-ship, where he will dance his celebrated hornpipe on
the quarter-deck every two hours, and go through his unequalled
parting address to his messmates (with the 'bacca-box, business)
mornings and evenings, for the purpose of exciting a true blue enthu-
siasm among the men. During the intervals of his performances on
board, MR. T. P. CookE will eat bank-notes between bread and butter,
and fry watches at a public-house on “the Hard,” thus giving the
sailors, who are hanging back from volunteering, a pleasant anticipa-
tion of the sailor's life ashore, exactly in keeping with SIR. C. NAPIER's
address.

THE POLITICAL CHEAP-JACK.
WE understand that an eccentric personage, who has been long
well known at Shrewsbury as a Political Cheap-Jack, has been lately
going about in Buckinghamshire with his cart, whence he is in the
habit of delivering an oration of this sort —
“Now, then, my Bucks—let me have the pleasure of making you a
few presents—an assortment of valuable pledges, warranted never to
break. I won't sell them to you; there is no such word as sell
in my book. I mean to give them away. All I want in return is
your plumpers : you that have any come forward—you that have
got none may go home and turn your wives' mangles. Here's a
valuable Protection screen, warranted to secure all your interests.
You shall not have it for a million votes—nor ten thousand—nor
five hundred—but I'll give it to any one of you who will offer me
two. Or come, say one if you will—half a loaf is better than no bread.

corn into that bushel, and it will never come out under five pounds

it is a liberal one 7 No, sir; I don't deal in liberal articles. If you want
them, you must go to Brummagem. Here's a whip—a splendid whip

BUGEAUD AFRICANUs has been recalled from Algeria. Previous to
leaving the scene of his innumerable triumphs—in the Moniteur-he
paid a farewell visit to the different tribes, who received him every-
where with open arms. The Marshal kept up the old interchange of
civilities, and presented them, before parting, with a few balls, which the
Kabyles returned with the true fire and hospitality of their country.
Dancing was kept up to the very last hour of the Marshal's stay, and
the French advanced backwards and forwards, and chasséd and dos-à-
dosed with the natives over the mountains, until they were fairly beaten,
and had scarcely a leg to stand upon.
MARSHAL BUGEAUD had a pressing invitation from ABD-EL-KADER,
hoping he should have the pleasure to see him in the Desert before he
left, as he had made every preparation to give him a warm reception;
but the Hero of a Hundred Razzias was compelled to defer this engage-
ment, with many others, till his next visit to the country, which is
expected to be, like MALBRook's, somewhere about “la Trinité.” The
Marshal, however, displayed his gallantry to the last, and gave the
Emir another proof of that politeness which he has always pursued
towards him in all his campaigns, by sending him his card, marked,
“Pour prendre congé," for ABD-El-KADER was not aware that Louis-
PHILIPPE had lately given him one.
The Emir was deeply moved when he heard of the Marshal's
departure, for though he had always kept him at a proper distance,
still he could not help regarding a man who made so many approaches
towards him with some degree of pity, if not sympathy, and was pained
to hear he was about to lose a faithful follower, who had so often gone
out of his way to walk in his footsteps. It is rumoured the Marshal,
on his return to France, will retire into private life, to complete the
Commentaries “De Bello Africano,” which he has begun in imitation of
CESAR's.

Good friends, ne do ye not my ghost to shame,
If with thinne sounde it crepe into your ears ;
Whenas, for laud of my yburied name,
Ye gatheren, wise clerks, and pleasant peers.
Demè ye not that, these four hundred years,
I, WILLIAM CAxton, a dead heart did keepe
Withinne the Abbey walls my silent sleepe.
A breath of my quick spirit shrined was
In every bookeyturned to print from pen,
By my true sons, and therewithal did pass
Athwart the ways and thro' the hearts of men,
And came, bringing me tidings back again
How wagged the queint world, that so I knew
How my so little art to giant grew.
Naught craved I, ne canopy of stone,
Ne of fair brass a daintie monument;
For in my art, meseemèd, I alone
Had set up my own tomb-stone, veramënt.
To be embalmed in leaves I was content;
The clerkly abbey Latine seemèd chaffe
To me, that had all print for epitaph.
Nobler methought it was to bear about
True words that speken wise men, new and old,
Than be from brass by hurrying feet trod out,
Or stretch in effigy of marble cold;
The which, for sixpence each, cokenays behold,
Hurried by vergers that ne letten stop
No man, but all befoul with their slip-slop.
Ne wolde I, by my will, abroad be shewed,
With NELson high upon a stone pillère,
Like that whereon, as clerkès seyn, abode
St. SIMEON the foul for many a year.
And sore I trembled in my bones, for feare
Lest, on some arch, a figure meet of fun
I stand should, like ye DUKE of WELLINGTON.
That I ne may be with no statue graced,
As statues goe, I pray each gentle heart 1
Save me from all committees, hight of taste,
From “high” or “low,” so it be “London” art—
From such honour full fain wolde I astart:

IMPORTANT TO EVERY FATHER OF A FAMILY.
EsPECTED SIR,--I lately sent a contribution to
a newspaper. I am proud to say it was
inserted, but in such a reduced shape that I
could have cried over it.
“The contribution in question was the birth
of a son, (the doctor says it is the finest child
he ever saw,) and it ran—the advertisement I
mean—as follows:–
“‘Yesterday at No. – Gower Street, the lady of PETER
BRiggs, Esq., officer of that distinguished corps in HER
MAJESTY's service, the Gentlemen-at-Arms, and cousin
to SIR John Cummings, merchant at Hong Kong, and late
Registrar-General in the Isle of Man, of a son. The
mother is doing remarkably well, and the child, a fine
healthy boy, is the admiration of every one who has seen
it. It has blue eyes, a Roman nose, and has not cried once."

cruelly omitted, and nothing but the plain fact stated, which I must say
annoyed me exceedingly, as I felt a little proud (if you are a father, sir,

as much space as the news from the United States, would have an
immense circulation. A dozen fathers, and as many mothers, might
easily start it; the expenses would be rapidly paid by the advertise-
ments, especially if no parent was limited to length. I cannot tell you,
sir, my indignation when I saw my dear child compressed into a
miserable line. I have written to the Editor in the most indignant
style, but he has taken no notice of my letter, though I can assure you
it was at least four pages long. I write to you, sir, as the Governor
of the Nation, and hope you will find room for this complaint of
“A FATHER of A FAMILY, (oNE BOY AND ONE GIRL).”

HUMBLY SHEwerH,
That each of your Petitioners is liable,

house, as the case may be ; and
that on Monday, the 14th inst.,
sundry soldiers, principally of the

order that they might be at hand
to take part in a Review in Hyde

necessity for holding.
That the said Review, which

deferred, on account of the weather,
to the 17th inst., whence your
Petitioners were enforced so much the longer to harbour and entertain
the said soldiers.
That the Review was held solely and entirely for the diversion and
amusement of certain distinguished foreigners and others; and accord-
ingly, that, for the same ends only, the soldiers were quartered on your
Petitioners.
Your Petitioners therefore humbly hope, that you will be graciously
pleased to suggest to the said distinguished foreigners and others, that
inasmuch as it was merely for their pleasure and gratification that the
soldiers were quartered upon your Petitioners, they, the distinguished
foreigners and others aforesaid, ought, in reason, for the indemnifi-
cation of your said Petitioners, to come down with something handsome.

THE Mons JULLIEN, which has lately raised its head at the Surrey
Zoological Gardens, has been experiencing a few dampers during the
past week by a series of showers more refreshing to the crops than
acceptable to the curly locks of the conductor and his orchestra. On
these occasions the visitors to the gardens have dſ course been few ;
and JULLIEN's chief audience have been bears, tigers, and those
original lions of the place who are not well pleased at finding an

had much trouble to make itself heard amid the vehement bellowings
of the bison. Of course, in rainy weather, the animals have had it all
their own way, and they have stood erect on their poles, or forward in
their cages, to laugh, as it were, to scorn the aimless efforts of the
energetic JULLIEN. The Surrey Zoological Gardens, though a most

we might have a chance of being made an ambassador to Timbuctoo, or one of the Sandwich
Islands, or even of representing HER MAJESTY at that Little Pedlington of Europe, Saxe-Coburg.
THE RAILWAY'S GROSS
MISMANAGEMENT;
OR, THE COMPLAINT OF THE “ENGINE-
DRIVER,” WERSIFIED.
YoU managers of railways,
Who meet to talk and dine,
Ah little do you think upon
The dangers of the line ;
Give ear unto your engineers,
And they will plainly show
All the wrack, which, alack 1
From mismanagement doth flow.
All who are engine-drivers
Must have tremendous pluck,
For when you get upon your seat
You trust your life to luck;
You must not be faint-hearted
For crash or overthrow,
And the spills from the ills
Of mismanagement that flow.
Sometimes our trains are mix'd up,
Of common sense in spite,
With several heavy carriages,
And others that are light ;
Out rolls the train, and no man
What next may come can know;
But whate'er happens here
From mismanagement doth flow.
But our worst source of peril
By far, is when we find
One engine put before the train,
And one to push behind;
Then jamm'd and crush'd together
Of carriages the row
Oft will be—which, you see,
From mismanagement doth flow.
Unto our trains, of breaksmen
There is a shameful lack;
And hence it is our lives and limbs
So often go to wrack,
For want of due assistance
Our peril when we know :
This defect from neglect
And mismanagement doth flow.
Ye legislative sages 1
On you it is we call;
For as for our proprietors,
Gain is their all in all,
Which, for the public safety,
They somewhat must forego,
Or your bills stop those ills
From mismanagement that flow.
IDissolving Portraits.
THE motto for the Photographic Por-
traits should be “Light come, light go,”
for as they are taken by the means of
light, so they disappear, similia similibus,
by the same agency. A correspondent
assures us, that of his portrait, which was
only taken “a little month” ago, there
is not a single feature left, excepting half
a whisker, and that is gradually melting
away into thin hair. We are sorry for
our correspondent's whiskers, and recom-
mend him to try a new portrait. We
have been told that nothing can take the
curl out of BEARD's.

MODERN STREETOLOGY.
STREETology is a modern science, but, like many other of the
modern sciences, the more we advance in it, the further are we off from
understanding it. The present cry is for wide streets, and accordingly
wide streets are formed; but, like the gentleman who built a house
without a staircase, our architects plan wide streets without any con-
sideration how we are to get into them, or how we are to get out of
them. Thus we get plenty of streets, but no thoroughfares; for every
new way of any extent or importance is remarkable for its beginning
at a place from which no one ever comes, and ending in a quarter to
which no one is ever going. We have magnificent preparations made
for opening a communication between Cook's Court and Jones's Build-
ings, but the approach from Cheapside to Blackfriars is still narrow,
tortuous, and often inaccessible.
The nomenclature of new streets is conducted on the same absurd
principle. The boldest ways have the meanest appellations, while the
most illustrious titles are given to the dirtiest lanes and the humblest
alleys. We find Smith Streets with foot-pavements twelve feet wide,
while Waterloo Street is in some remote hole, through which WELLING-
ToN could never have brought up a van half the size of one of JULLIEN's.
The only really appropriately-styled thoroughfare we know of is Little
Brougham Street, somewhere in Bermondsey, which winds about in the
most extraordinary manner—now assuming an openness, and even a
grandeur, that frequently belong to its prototype; and now falling away
into the most meandering and most eccentric courses conceivable.
If we were to move for—and get—a return of the amount of streets
monopolised by such ordinary names as JoHN, Robert, Thomas, and
GEoRGE, to say nothing of our old friend SMITH, we should find the
three first by themselves in possession of at least half the entire
Metropolis. We hope that one of the earliest motions made in the
new Parliament will be for a Committee to inquire into the expediency
of erasing at least one half of the Roberts, Johns, GEORGEs, and
SMITHS from the Directory, or street statute-book.
ANOTHER FRENCH REVOLUTION 1
ALL the clerks and persons employed by the French Government
have received orders to shave off their moustaches. This daring attack
upon the liberty of the person and the best affections of La Jeune
France has not been made without the strongest precautions having
been previously taken by the military authorities to suppress any
public outbreak. The fortifications round Paris have been reinforced
doubly strong, and the artillerymen of Vincennes have been ordered to
stand to their guns with lighted matches, and to fire upon the capital
at the very first demonstration of a seditious movement. We subjoin
the latest intelligence we have received upon this, the greatest epoch
which has occurred in French history since the three days of July.
June 10th.-Louis-PHILIPPE has retreated to Neuilly. His ministers
have entreated him upon their knees to rescind the fatal order. His
Majesty was firm, and excused himself by saying he was determined to
put a new face upon France. “Oh, Sire l’exclaimed GUIzot in an
please, but do not sacrifice the moustache which has so long adorned
it ; or else, have a care, Sire,” continued the faithful Minister, in a
voice of suffocating emotion, “the hairs of your Majesty's head are
*" “Mon ami, je porte une perruque,” was His Majesty's only
reply.
June 11th.-A deputation of ladies has waited upon the Queen at
Neuilly. She was moved by the cries of the petitioners, and has
promised to take the moustaches of France in hand. Confidence is
restored, and this evening there was seen in the Boulevard des Italiens
a réunion of the most popular “barbes” of Paris. Every variety of
moustache attended, and the meeting was made still more formidable
by the adhesion of the “imperials,” who are naturally alarmed at this
sweeping state of things, as they consider that if the moustaches fall,
they will be cut off the next, as the two have generally hung together.
Great excitement prevailed at ten o'clock, when it was announced at
the Cercle that the MARQUIs DE VIEUxcARAMBOLE and JULES DE
FUNAMBULE, who are known to be two of the most extensive whisker-
growers throughout France, had joined the Moustachio-League. The
Funds have fallen three centimes.
June 12th.-The marchands de circ-à-moustache have presented a pe-
tition to the Chamber of Deputies, in which they prove that if the
moustaches go, they must go also, as their merchandise is only of that
nature which enables them to live from “hand to mouth.”
Twelve o’clock.-There is an alarming report at the Hôtel Vantini
that EUGENE SUE has shaved off his moustache. This report, however,
is disbelieved by those who know how much EUGENE loved it. ALEx-
ANDRE DUMAs, however, has declared, “sur la parole d'un gentilhomme,”
which cannot be disbelieved, that he has seen the moustache in a black
frame, suspended with immortelles, in poor SUE's bed-room, with the
following epitaph underneath it : “A mon plus fidèle ami, qui ne m'a
jamais quitté pour 25 ans.” Victor HUGo is writing an Ode to it.
Two o'clock.-The Doctrinaires declare that this tyranny of shaving
off what a Frenchman clings to, of all others, with the greatest tenacity,
is grounded upon the fortifications of Paris, in which it was evident
the great plan of Louis-PHILIPPE was to “raser toute la capitale, et de
ce coup faire la barbe a toute la France.”
June 13th–There has been a long discussion in the Chamber of
Deputies.—MoNSIEUR THIERs vehemently stigmatised this odious law,
in a speech of four hours, as a master-stroke on the part of Louis-
PHILIPPE to renew the entente cordiale, by sending up the price of
English razors and the Savon de Windsor.
Ten o'clock.-The PRINCE DE JoinvillE has joined the insurgents.
The entire fleet is with him. The army is also on the side of the
Moustachionistes. All the barbers have fled from Paris. The complexion
of affairs is getting blacker every day. QUEEN CHRISTINA has sent in
word to the Council of the League, that she gives her entire counte-
nance to the cause. Bou MAzA has done the same. The excitement
spreads every hour; there is no knowing where it will stop. It is re-
ported that the PRINCE DE Joinville has been arrested and shaved in a
most barefaced manner, à la pointe de labaïonette, as an example to others.
The Prince has not been seen, but his friends say he is too much cut up
to show his face.
Twelve o'clock-Two ministers have thrown up their portefeuilles
sooner than resign their moustaches. MARSHAL SouLT has been
closeted with a soap-brush for these three days. The last time the
servant looked at him through the key-hole the old veteran was ob-
served to be in tears. He evidently could not nerve his hand—that
brave hand which has never trembled before—for the fatal blow. The
Marshal's moustache is supposed to be in its fiftieth summer.
Three o'clock.-The public offices are all closed. All those holding
Government appointments and moustaches have resigned, and as
every person in France who has an appointment has also a moustache,
there is not a person left to carry on the government. All the ministries
are deserted. It is expected that the navy will next resign,and then the
army, in which case Louis-PHILIPPE must abdicate, or else rescind the
unpopular order. In the meantime he has thrown himself upon the
fortifications of Paris. May they be a soft cushion to receive him in
his fall!
We shall publish the progress of this revolution, which hitherto
has been carried on without the spilling of a single drop of blood, -
excepting in the case of the martyr SUE, who, in removing the left
moustache, slightly cut himself—in editions, if necessary, every
quarter-of-an-hour. We have six electric telegraphs working night
and day on the different roads. Let us hope the heir to the throne—
the CoMTE DE PARIs, who at present is too young to side one way or
the other—will not be ultimately cut off by a coup de rasoir/
E.
DOUBLY HAZARDOUS.
THE Insurance Offices intend introducing a clause into their policies
to the effect that no insurance will be paid when the life has been
lost on a railway. The risk is considered now to be infinitely greater
attitude of supplication, “alter the face of France as much as you
than that of a sea voyage.

PUNCHPS CANDIDATES FOR PARLIAMENT.
— No one will deny the right of Punch to have a voice,
---
W OTE. and a pretty loud one, too, in the choice of members
for the ensuing Parliament. We have therefore to call
[ÖR upon the electors throughout the kingdom to send to
Parliament such persons, who, if they cannot be
either useful or ornamental, may at least be found
amusing, by their being adapted to caricaturing pur-
poses. An emptiness of head may be accompanied by
a fulness of cheek, or a shortness of intellect by a
length of face, that may prove in the highest degree
acceptable to the public, through the representations
of our artists. Those who cannot serve their
country as politicians, may at least have the merit
of diverting her as grotesques; and we hope that
this will not be forgotten in those places where the
candidates are on an equality of intellectual insigni-
ficance, while one can boast a large majority of
moustache or some feature entitling him to decided
pre-eminence. An enormous imperial would enable
the supporters of such a man as CochRANE, for
instance, to get up a cry of “CochRANE and TIP ſ”
a cry which the electors of Westminster would, we
trust, never disgrace themselves by attending to,
however effectual it might be in some half-starved,
sneaking little borough, to which we recommend the
Wandering Minstrel to transfer the offer of his services. One of our
artists has supplied us with a few sketches representing the sort of
thing that would be useful for the artistical department of Punch,
and we recommend candidates at once—if they wish for our support
—to get themselves regularly “made up" after some of the accom-
panying patterns.
MTRING
INCREDIBLE ATROCITY.
A STATEMENT, which really appears incredible, appeared on Friday,
last week, in the columns of several of our contemporaries. It will
be recollected that John TAwell, a Quaker, was executed in March,
1845, for murder; and that the wretched man left behind him a
widow, and a large amount of property. Now, our contemporaries
concur in asserting that this poor woman has been deprived of that
property upon the pretence that by her husband's conviction it has
become forfeited to the crown 1 They affirm that this monstrous act
of cruelty was perpetrated by a commission of “escheat,” held at
Hertford on the evening of Thursday, the 17th instant. The Times
informs us that—
“The proceedings did not commence until 3 o'clock, and so secret, had the matter
been kept, that, with the exception of the commissioners, jury, and legal gentlemen and
witnesses connected with the inquiry, no persons except reporters were present."
Well might the authors of such iniquitous proceedings have kept
them secret. But this is not all. The newspapers further relate that
the commissioners proceeded to institute an inquiry as to the amount
of the property left by TAwell, which was estimated at nearly £8000 ;
and that, in order to determine the question, they had actually the
barbarity to summon before them MRs. TAwell herself.
“Mas. TAwell wept bitterly, and appeared to suffer great distress of mind."
Why, surely all our contemporaries must have been the dupes of some
wicked incendiary. This case of legal atrocity may perhaps be founded
on fact. Such a transaction may have occurred in the dark ages, in
the times of hanging, drawing, quartering, and burning alive; or, along
while ago, it may have taken place in Turkey, where it was customary
to rase a criminal's dwelling-place, and to sell his poor innocent widow
and children for slaves; but at this day, no one, even in the East,
except a BEDERHAN-BEY, would think of punishing a widow for
the crime of her husband. . .
What an inconceivable refinement of cruelty, too, to drag the wife
into court to beggar herself by her own evidence We will venture to
say that so shocking a piece of inhumanity never disgraced even the
Star Chamber. As soon should we dream of seeing the penal statutes
enforced, as the obsolete law which avenges itself on an offender's
relatives. No : the whole story must have been a malignant fabrica-
tion, designed, by imputing to the Crown and the Government a
deed revolting to humanity, to bring the constituted authorities into
contempt.

HIGH ART
IN WESTMINSTER HALL.
UNCH is, in the opinion
of all artists, the only
competent person to
dictate to the Fine
Arts' Commissioners.
We have been over-
whelmed with commu-
nications on the sub-
ject of the Westmin-
ster Hall Exhibition,
just opened. The
judges, like the man in
the fable of the Miller
and his Ass, seem to
have given satisfaction
to nobody among the
artists, except the
º prizeholders. As some
| consolation for this,
however, they have
given satisfaction to
everybody else.
MR. BEAto ANgE-
Lico PUGIN HARDLINEs
sends us an indignant
denunciation of the
Commissioners, for
overlooking the claims of early Christian Art. “Why,” he asks, “is my picture of
Esther before Ahasuerus, in my finest manner, and in good preservation (see sketch),
allowed to stand unsold, against the wall of my studio? The canvassisten feet by
five; the figures are seven feet high, and in the grandly severe taste of the fourteenth
century, when the Art was at its zenith of religious power and chastened purity.
Look at the earnest manhood (not unmingled with rising admiration) of the king,
IITTW
and the womanly, devotional sweetness of my Esther, and then tell me why this
work is not filling a space in the House of Lords?”
MR. LEMPRIERE LAYMAN laments the utter absence of the good old subjects
which used to form the leading incidents in the artist's History of England.
“There is not one picture of Alfred burning the Cakes /" groans Mr. LAYMAN,
“Where is our nationality ? I looked in vain for a Finding of the Body of Harold.
There is, it is true, a Burial of the said body, but a body must be found in order
to be buried. Where, I ask, is Margaret of Anjou and the Robber Where is
Eleanor sucking the Poison? What can be expected for Art when we see our artists
thus leaving the old paths to paint battles of Meanee, and such contemporary rub-
º: we shall next see Gil Blas and the Vicar of Wakefield banished from the
cademy.”
He sends us the above sketch of his great work of Charles II. in the Oak, and
demands public comparison between his picture and MR. Townshend's, on the
same subject. “Where, in MR. Townshend's picture,”
he wishes to know, “is the characteristic touch of manners
in the Roundhead smoking the Pipe and Short-cut of the Period,
whom you see on the right of my sketch? Besides,
MR. Townshend's king has no insignia of royalty; by
which the effect of his figure is utterly lost. Observe,
too, the expression of concern in the face of my CHARLEs,
significant at once of his uncomfortable seat in the tree,
and the presence of his enemies underneath. There is a
delicate touch, with much point (though I say it,) in the
Roundhead's pike, so dangerously near the Royal Person 1"
We are anxious to do justice to our correspondents,
and accordingly expose their sketches to the criticisms of
the public—in other words—the readers of Punch. .
©ut @bituary.
We regret to announce the death, at the family residence
in George Street, Hanover Square, of the British and
Foreign Institute, aged between four and five years, sin-
cerely regretted by its sole surviving parent. Its death
was occasioned by a rapid decline, but it had been weakly
from its birth. Its end was tranquil, as it was completely
exhausted by its previous struggles. A hatchment has been
put up, with a “Non” inserted before the usual “Resurgam.”
The Parliamentary Bills of Mortality record an alarming
number of deaths among the Infant Bills. This period of
the session is usually fatal to numbers of these poor little
creatures, whose parents are guilty of the greatest cruelty
in deserting their offspring, or otherwise making away with
them. The crime of Legislative Infanticide is, we are
afraid, on the increase. A monster in human form, known
by the name of STRUTT, was recently detected in the act of
dropping a Railway Bill at the door of George Hudson,
Esq., M.P.; and it is only by the greatest exertions of
several humane individuals that the Health of Towns Bill,
whose parents have been suspected of an intention of
cruelly abandoning it, has been preserved alive through the
session. It is not yet out of danger.
SELF-ACTING FURNITURE.
We have seen advertisements in all the newspapers, for
some months past, with this heading. We have not the
least notion what it means. Can it be that modern inge-
nuity has invented furniture which helps us to discharge
our duties to ourselves and our neighbours? We can at
once appreciate the value of a bed which, at 6 o'clock every
morning, turns out the occupant on the floor, and makes
itself; or a shower-bath which persists steadily, on the
coldest days, in irrigating its owner, notwithstanding his
struggles; or chairs and tables which, the moment a quar-
ter's rent is due, take themselves in execution, and set off
to the broker's ; or a dining-table which, the instant the
guests had eaten and drunk as much as was good for them,
should walk out of the dining-room and into the kitchen,
notwithstanding the remonstrance of the gentleman at the
head of it. It would be difficult to live otherwise than vir-
tuously in a house thus furnished; and we trust that the
“self-acting furniture” is constructed to act upon none
but high and severe principles of social morality.
Counterfeit suns.
TREMENDous consternation has lately prevailed in Scot-
land, according to the Flyin Courant, at the appearance of
several counterfeit suns, which, as the Scotch are very
slow at discriminating between real brilliance and sham,
have proved very embarrassing. Various mistakes have
arisen from persons endeavouring to keep themselves warm
in the wrong sun, out of which the shine has not been
sufficiently taken to prevent imposition. We understand
that a respectable thermometer was so far deceived as to
stand at sixty-five degrees in one of the fictitious suns,
which the too credulous instrument had mistaken for the
old original luminary.

+junty's Eigits to gome of tſje Courts of Gurope.
Midst all our long acquaint-
ance with “Camps and
Courts,” we recollect no-
thing that can be compared
with the County Court in
Castle Street. Though we
have never been regularly
presented at this Court, we
have succeeded in making
our way thither; but we
never have yet been, and
we trust never shall be,
implicated in any of its
very numerous levees. The
Castle Street County Court
has no pretension to archi-
tectural grandeur. The
façade is of the plainest
deal; but, thrown up into
relief, in the centre of a
dark-green portal, is-orought to be—a bright brass knocker. Time,
and the boys—those inveterate enemies of everything great as well as of
everything little—have perhaps torn it away, and plucked out by the
very roots that tongue to tell the arrival of a visitor—that tongue
which every reader of Young's Night Thoughts” will recognise as the
bell in the door-post. There is something wondrously humble in the
entrance to that County Court of Castle Street! Nothing marks it as
the abode of Justice but a board over the top of the portal, bearing the
simple words, “Westminster County Court;” and, if our recollection
does not deceive us, it is bounded on one side by a tailor's, as if all
who entered the County Court might be sewed up at the shortest
notice.

The admittance by the passage is easy enough, and reminds us of our
old friend the Latin quotation—
“facilis descensus Averni,
Sed revocare gradum, superasque evadere adauras,
Hic labor, hoc opus est;"
- -
which may be literally rendered thus –
The door is open, and the passage short,
Quick the descent into a County Court;
The depths and dangers of the Law's abyss
'Tis really quite impossible to miss;
But to escape that atmosphere of fees,
And taste once more a purer, healthier breeze;
To quit that Court where ushers grandly frown,
Telling the various “parties” to stand down:
To quit that Court—where Phipps enacts the Snob-
Aye, that's the labour—there's, indeed, the job.
On penetrating to the end of the passage, which is ornamented with
a series of poses plastiques, in the shape of drunken witnesses lolling
against the walls, the stranger finds himself in a species of hall, where
| clerks are employed at various compartments, saying as little as they
can in answer to inquiries, and doing as little as possible. At one end
of this hall is a tremendous window, the lower part of which is formed
of ground glass, but through an upper pane of the glazed aperture the
top of a forensic wig is occasionally visible. The bobbing up and
down of this venerated horse-hair reveals by glimpses the fact that
* Young, or somebody else—but, in our multiplicity of reading and research, we

justice is being administered on the other side of the window. The
traveller now pursues his way towards the Court itself, threading a
what with the rails put up by the carpenter, and the
| still stronger obstacle of suitors, the steering is ex-
ceedingly difficult through the sea of mortality that
leads by the Ushers' Straits to the Judges' Harbour.
It would be as well for every stranger intending to
- reconnoitre this Court, that he should take with him
º a guide, for the people employed on the spot are
| remarkable for their ignorance of everything connected
with the locality.
Quitting the menials on the floor, let us soar up to the lofty bench,
and join the judge, who, refreshed by a buttered biscuit, regaled
by the scent of a bouquet, and irrigated by a stream from an
adjacent decanter, pours forth his equitable decisions with a grace
and dignity worthy of a higher tribunal. “His Lordship,” “His
Honour,” “My Lud,” “Sir” and “You, sir,” as he is promiscuously
called by the suitors or witnesses, in their various gradations of
respect or familiarity, has indeed hard work of it; and a half-crown
barometer nailed to the wall on his right hand must be a most useful
guide in enabling him to preserve that coolness which marks his
demeanour, however hot and angry may be the contest between
plaintiffs, defendants, and visitors. The admirable discrimination he
exhibits when a rush of contradictory oaths comes upon him from all
quarters of the Court at once, is really something astonishing , and it
is only the quickness of his intellect, sustained by the nicety of his
discretion, that can enable MR. Moylan to administer justice with the
firmness and facility for which he stands or rather sits conspicuous.
The bench itself is formed by one of those folding wash-hand stands,
which open so as to make three compartments, and the outside
couple are devoted to the decanter and bouquet, by which the judge is
sustained in his arduous duties. The centre compartment is of course
hollow, being intended for the wash-hand basin; but the learned judge
covers the round aperture with his “pad” and note-book, while under
it he keeps his bag of biscuits, as well as a bottle of scent, when the
presence of one of the unwashed, as a party or a witness, brings avery
strong case before the county tribunal.
Over the bench, but quite out of everybody's sight—except the
usher's—is a clock, which is never right; and higher up is a skylight,
which is never open. On the right and leſt of the bench are seats
covered with green baize, intended, we suppose, for the reception of
royal or illustrious visitors. On the left of the judge, but far enough
off to make it difficult to get at him without tumbling over an ink-
stand, sits the associate, on whose left is a square hole in the wall,
through which he is enabled to chat with the people in the next room,
or play at catch-ball by darting papers from one apartment to the
other through the little aperture. We must confess that none of this
pastime was going on during our visit, for the associate was hard at
shoutsfor silence and the bad jokes of the spectacled usher.
Opposite the bench is a raised division for plaintiff and defendant,
but the partition between them is too low to prevent that interchange
of high words, which in nine cases out of ten they are sure to come to.
The witnesses seem to consist of anybody who happens to be in the
a moment unsupported for want of a witness. The plaintiff and
defendant took it in turns to swear down each other as long as a witness
was left on either side; and as the judge, very properly, seemed to say,
“What am to do? I must take the peoples' oaths tº the trial became
a kind of game at odd man, in which the suitor who could go on
longest bringing a fresh witness to the scratch, perforce obtained the
judgment in his favour.
As every alternate witness had to be summoned from a public-house
hard by, there may be, perhaps, a house of call for witnesses some-
where in the neighbourhood. Whenever a fact was waiting to be
deposed to, the party had only to run to the public-house, when he
would return in a few minutes with somebody perfectly prepared to

swear to anything...It might be a saving of time to count the
witnesses on both sides at once, and begin by giving a decision in
work as long as we stayed, except when he was interrupted by the
way; for we remarked, while we remained in court, that no fact stood

favour of that party who could show, as far as numbers are concerned,
a balance of evidence. After witnessing some half-dozen of these
| trials, in which a majority of those who exercised the swearing
franchise gained the victory, we went away with the conviction that
a good deal of the justice brought home to every man's door cannot
be taken in without the person who receives it being taken in also.
THE CANT OF CANTWELL.
An Irish, Roman Catholic Bishop, most inappropriately named
CANTwell, his cant being of the worst description, has addressed to
MR. John O'ConnELL a letter which contains the following passages:—
“The sad condition to which our unfortunate country is reduced, and the treatment
which she has received from an English Parliament during this season of unexampled
suffering, are sufficient to arouse every Irishman who is not lost to all sense of national
honour, or national safety, into the most determined exertion to repeal the miscalled
+ ºr -
Act of Union. * *
“The scenes of unparalleled wretchedness by which we are everywhere surrounded;
the inhuman course pursued by the present Ministry; the inadequacy of their measures
to save the lives of the famishing millions; the present legislation tending, or rather pro- |
ducing, the certainty of beggaring the rich and starving the destitute; the utter disregard
of Irish feeling; the total ignorance of Irish wants, and thorough indifference of irish
interests evinced by England, whether Whig or Tory;-these extinguish in us every
hope for our oppressed and misgoverned country, save what is to be derived from a
domestic Parliament.”
DR. CANtwell complains of the “treatment” which Ireland has received
from an English Parliament. What sort of treatment, on the part of
Parliament, he would have preferred for her, it is difficult to conjecture.
Since, however, he so decidedly condemns the treatment she has met
with, we may presume that he would have wished it to be precisely the
reverse of what it has been. Parliament would, therefore, perhaps
have pleased DR. CANTwell, had it, instead of taking Irish affairs into
consideration as soon as it met, postponed them to the end of the
session. Instead of voting several millions for the relief of Ireland,
Parliament, to have gained DR. CANTwell's approbation, should have
refused to give her a sixpence. Parliament, in short, should have given
Ireland neither time normoney; whereas it has bestowed more of both
on her than it could afford, and consequently earns the abuse of DR.
CANTwell.
Moreover, according to DR. CANTwell, the course which the
Ministry has pursued towards the Irish is “inhuman.” As that course
consisted in feeding them, he evidently disapproves of their having
been fed. “England, in fine,” says Dr. CANTwell, “has shown an
utter disregard of Irish feeling, and a total ignorance of Irish wants.”
Possibly, if Irish feeling and Irish wants are represented by DR. CANT-
weLL, England has evinced an utter disregard of Irish bad feeling, by
ministering, in spite of it, to Irish necessities. She has also shown her
ignorance of Irish wants, if those wants are comprised in the want of a
“domestic Parliament.” She has imagined that the wants of Ireland
were the want of bread and potatoes, which, in her “total ignorance,”
she has done her best to supply. But if she does not know what the
Irish want, she knows very well what they do not want. They do not
want such bishops as DR. CANTwell. -

PRIMA FACIE ATTRACTION.
The Ethiopian Serenaders advertised, that on their final performance
on Saturday, July the 3rd, they would “appear for the first time in
white faces.”. It will, of course, be seen from this, that the Ethiopian
Serenader, like somebody else, is not so black as he is painted. “To
this complexion have we come at last,” would have been a suitable
motto for the occasion. We cannot very well account for the adoption
of the black face; but we presume they thought that, like BUNN's
“hollow hearts,” it was necessary to “wear a mask,” in order to obtain
moir, would scarcely be reconciled to seeing them au naturel, and the
difficulty of believing black to be white, must of course be great among
the public at large, by whom the Serenaders have been visited. By Ron
tells us of hair having “grown white in a single night,” on account of
“sudden fears;” but we remember no precedent for this change from a
black skin to a white in a similarly brief period.
This washing of the serenading blackamoor white, is one of those
wonders which can only be performed within the walls of a theatre,
and we recommend its adoption by every party of black serenaders all
over the kingdom.
A CRITICAL COMPLAINT.
ONE of the daily critics, in speaking of MADEMoisellE CARollNE,
the female equestrian at Vauxhall, declares that she appeared to be a
part of the horse, and the scribe intimates that he could not distinguish
the fair rider from the animal. This is indeed holding her up as “the
very Centatºr of attraction.”

The exile of SHARESPEARE from Covent Garden and Drury Lane
threatens now to be permanent.
portation for life, instead of mere banishment for a limited period.
Under these circumstances there is every probability of an asylum
being offered to him over the water at Astley's, where SHERIDAN has
lately found a welcome. Pizarro has been literally “mounted,” in fine
style, at that Theatre; and we hope that instead of seeing SHAKESPEARE
only occasionally set to music, we may have the pleasure of seeing
him very frequently set to harness and horsemanship. Othello, as an
Equestrian Tragedy, would be a very exciting novelty. -
There is also internal evidence in many of SHAKESPEARE's plays, that
the immortal bard contemplated availing himself of the resources of the
royal amphitheatre, Westminster Bridge, or some similar establishment,
for a perfect performance of his tragedies. Richard's ardent longing for
“a horse ! a horse !” can only be accounted for upon the principle we
have suggested. Again, it has been doubted by a very high authority,
whether Othello does not utter some allusion to his keeping a gig in
the beautiful speech which ends—according to the pronunciation of an
eminent Franch artist—with the words, “Chay-horse is come again l’”
We are quite convinced that a rapid act of Shakespeareship in the
circle at ASTLEY's, would be an extremely attractive feature of the
performances at that popular place of amusement. Hamlet's philo-
It is evidently a case of trans-
sophy could not come with better effect than spoken from the back of
a horse at full gallop, which would finely illustrate the ups and downs
of life that astonish and perplex the moralist. We beg to recommend
the subject to the serious attention of the friends of the late Swan of
: And we hope a public meeting will be called as early as
possible.
Quite Natural.
AN hospital on a very extensive scale, has just been built at the
Paddington terminus of the Great Western. We have no doubt that
in time every large railway will have its hospital, not only at the limits
of the line, but at some of the principal stations. Such a result must
be looked for in pursuance of the inevitable law that supply is the
sure consequence of demand. We shall not be surprised if hospitals
become regular portions of every railway scheme, for the Directors of a
Company ought to have all the workings of the line as much under
their own eyes as possible.

STRANGE EPIDEMIC.
OUR attention has been called to a fearful epidemic
which seizes on the clerks engaged in paying money-
orders at the new office in St. Martin's-le-Grand. The
symptoms are very peculiar, and seem to affect, every one
the moment he takes his place as an underling in the
office alluded to. The patient is first afflicted by a vacant
staring of the eyes directly an order is presented to him
He is then troubled with a sort of speech-
lessness—peculiar to official subordinates—which prevents
him from answering the questions addressed to him. His
hand seems to be paralysed, for it is scarcely able to take 2.
hold of the order on its being shown to him, and a species
of coma overtakes him when he has to produce the money,
which he can scarcely manage to take from his till, much
less to count out and pay over without the greatest diffi-
culty, which renders the operation very painful to witness,
as well as exceedingly tedious. Sometimes the patient is
seized with fits of yawning and stretching of the arms,
particularly when the money-orders wanting his attention
are unusually numerous. We have been requested to
administer a little of the bark of our baton, which we
have no doubt will act as a stimulant to these money-order
functionaries, who are getting almost useless from their
apathetic listlessness.

INFLUENCE OF THE IMAGINATION.

The danger of giving loose to the fancy is frequently pointed out ; but we have
seldom heard so sad a case as that of a friend of ours, who having lately been
feeding on haricot beans, in consequence of the dearness of bread, has taken it into
his head that he is changed into a horse, and has made various attempts to draw
his own gig, while he is neglecting his ordinary avocations. What makes the
matter worse is the fact that the poor fellow who fancies himself a horse is saddled
with an enormous family; and he has been running about exclaiming, with

BENJAMIN DISRAELI PASSING THE RUBICON
MR. Dish AELI has informed the electors of Buckinghamshire that “he
waited some time before he determined to pass the Rubicon, but
having passed the Rubicon, he will certainly go to Rome.” He is at
liberty to go to Jericho if he likes ; but we should like to know when
it was that Dish AELI passed the Rubicon, and what is the situation of
the Rubicon that DisrAELI passed ? We find that he has elected
himself champion of the yeomen, but we have not heard by whose
suffrages this distinction has been secured to him. Such an event as
DISRAELI passing the Rubicon is worthy of a cartoon—an honour
which it will be seen we have awarded it.
Qſìt $iege of Gibraltat.
We have heard a great deal of what railways were to do in annihi-
lating time and space; but who would ever have thought that Gibraltar
would so soon be brought within a sixpenny fare by the omnibus 7
Such is, nevertheless, the fact, for “the Rock” is now accessible from
the Strand every five minutes, and that impregnable fortress in the
Mediterranean is scarcely more than a stone’s-throw from the
“Elephant.”—as the Elephant and Castle is curtly called by travellers.
The spirited proprietor of the Surrey Zoological Gardens, who has
already brought Vesuvius home to every man's door, and rendered
ancient Rome accessible to the million, has presented us with a cheap
Gibraltar, which is served up au naturel in the first instance, and after-
wards a la Tartare, for only one shilling. A survey of Gibraltar from
the lake of the Surrey Zoological Gardens is exceedingly interesting,
though the first glance convinced us that Gibraltar must have been
sadly Gibr-altered since we were there last, if the picture is a facsimile
of its present condition.
JULLIEN is there also, and we regret to say, is not half so effective
by daylight as by gaslight. He looks very faded in the morning, and
he reminded us a good deal of Vauxhall in the middle of winter.
PUNCH TO PETER BORTHWICK.
MY DEAR PETER,
In consequence of the very proper part you took on the Poor
Law Amendment discussion, on Thursday, June 24th, in the House of
Commons, when you succeeded in introducing a clause to prevent the
separation of man and wife after the age of sixty, and beat the Prime
Minister, who opposed this just and humane provision, I hereby give
you an indemnity, for six months from this date, for all the folly you
may have committed or may hereafter commit, until this protection
expires. And I hereby call upon all my emissaries to give you “aid
and protection” for the space I have named ; and I subjoin a description
of your person, by which you may be known by all my allies, in all
quarters of the globe.
Name, PETER BoRTHwick,-Age, old enough to know (generally)
better.—Forehead, usually considered empty until now.—Nose, poking
into affairs it don't understand, except in the present instance.—Height,
very insignificant, but materially raised on this occasion.
(Signed) Punch.
