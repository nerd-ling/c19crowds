PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PRE
ACE

HATEFUL on this afternoon of midsummer was the double line of lofty elms that led up to the Moated
Manor-house, with its guard of Norman towers. So it struck the fancy of the person of exotic aspect
who was striding easily up the avenue at the end of a long cheroot, with a small Stars-and-Stripes flag under each arm,
and whistling a bar or two of " The Stately Homes of Eiif/lawl." "Say," said the perfect Stranger, as he overtook a
gentleman of homely exterior, and clapped him pleasantly on the back, "you happen to know if the pro-prietor of
these ruins is anxious to do a deal?" The Lord of the Manor answered with a noble dignity, "If you are good
enough to refer to myself," he said, "I have no intention of disposing of my ancestral property. My name is Bull."
"Proud to make your acquaintance, Mr. Bull. Shake. You are at present conversing with Jonathan M. Yankes,
of New York City (M. for Monroe, Sir), and Agent of the Great Amurican Pioneer and British Isles Development
Trust. That is my card, Sir. And let me tell you there is a future before your country, Sir, soon as we start in
under the Pond with our Pan-Anglo-Saxon Submarine Toob. We are dead-set on opening up these Islands, Sir; but we
allow that there are some institootions in the Old Place which give us a six-holes beating in the matter of sentiment
and picturesqueness, doo to age." The Lord of the Manor bowed coldly.
"Where we can persuade the holders to let go of their assets," continued the Stranger, "we propose to take these
relics over as going concerns and preserve them for pos-terity. We are now sizing up some of your brightest antiqui-
ties, such as Stratford-on-Avon, and the like. With your permission, Sir, I will pro-ceed to sample the heirlooms. Kf
you hev a cat'logue handy, we might get through with this business in time for me to hitch my private car on to your
Down-South Night Crawler. A stance of the British Museum Roof-Garden Cafe Syndicate is fixed for to-morrow,
10 a.m.; and at noon I reckon to take a short run west to peg out the Old Windsor Boar Park, where we are laying
down our Whitney-Muggins Stud Farm for the Improvement of the British Race-horse; and at 3.30 p.m., I come right
hack to the Metropolis for the Crystal Palace and Piccadilly Overhead Track Combine Meeting, when a notion for All-
fired Crow-Catchers will be on the tapee. Things are humming, Sir, both in and around your Capital."
A fine reserve characterised the reply of the Lord of the Manor. "You do not appear," he said, "to grasp the
fact that there are things which money cannot buy from an. honourable Englishman. But I shall be happy, in the
capacity of host, to show you over my place. By the way, may one ask how you reconcile your schemes of annexation
with what is known by you as the Monroe Doctrine 1"
"The late Colonel Monroe," replied the Pioneer, "was a whole-souled man, Sir. But he lacked imagination. He
failed to grasp the re-verse of the medallion. And he overlooked the twentieth century. The twentieth century, Sir,

will bulk pretty consid'ble in the history of the de-velopment of Europe. I guess it would surprise C'lumbus some if
he could resurrect and see Amurica discovering the Old World."
*.*.****••
"That there, Sir," said the Pioneer later on, "is a cunning soot of armour. Med'eval, I guess?"
"One of my people wore it at Agincourt, I believe," said Mr. Bull.
"Wa'al, I grant it looks more at home here than it would in your War Office. Its rel'tive up-to-dateness would
jar on the official sense of antiquity in that Burreau. We opine, Sir, that we have no place in our Pioneer Scheme for
your mil'tary institootions. We reckon to keep them on ice for the future stoodent of antiques. And now, Sir, I will ask
you to name a price, right away, for this baronial mansion, with grounds, relics, and general fixings, as it stands."
"I repeat," said the Lord of the Manor, "that money cannot buy my family possessions. I would not part with
them even for ten times their market value; no, not for a million sterling. English gentlemen, I' am glad to think,
retain something of their old pride and patriotism."
"Ef you will throw your eye over this document," replied the Stranger, itnperturbably, as he handed him an
envelope, " I will walk around the par-tares for a matter of five minutes and, come back to you right here."
* * * * .* * * *
The interval for reflection, brief but sufficient, had expired The eye of the Lord of the Manor still rested lovingly
on a cheque to bearer for fifteen million dollars. "You see me, Sir, on time," remarked the Pioneer. "I reckon we "ve
fixed that trifle up straight enough. Say, how soon can you quit?"
"Had you been a foreigner in the full sense," replied Mr. Bull, "I must undoubtedly have declined your highly
generous offer. But Blood, as I now feel, is thicker than water, and I am conscious that our two countries are daily
drawing closer under the influence, if I may employ a pleasantry, of the recent Morganitic Alliance. But I must put
one condition upon my acceptance of your handsome proposal. It is that I shall be allowed to retain a single treasure
from my library, the very latest of a long series of which the previous numbers are already known to me by heart."
"Sir," replied the Pioneer, "as representing the Trust, I claim to have a soul above low-down greed. The work in
question is yours. And ef it is to be had on the book-stores anyway, I grant I shall annex a dooplicate."
'*******»
Not wholly suggestive of despair was the figure which, before the afternoon was out, might have been seen retiring
down the long avenue of lofty elms. It belonged to the ex-Lord of the Manor, who thus "through Eden took his
solitary way" towards the lodge-gates, an exile from the home of his birth. Secured in his small bundle of necessities
lay the potent draught (at sight), a princely compensation for disturbance; while under his arm ho held that priceless
balm of adversity, Mr. PUNCH'S

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
m

"JACKIDBS."
"His last appearance! "Most of us can appraise at its worth the
value of this announcement when it concerns a popular comedian
or vocalist. Thenceforth, we might fairly deduce many " last
appearances" ere the well-graced favourite should bow his
final farewell. But, with Mr. Punch's great cartoonist, this is
not so. It is his wish that his words should be taken literally.
His last cartoon for Mr. Punch appears this week. During a
period of something over fifty years, working with almost
unbroken regularity, week after week, and year by year, he
has given the British public his very best. A grand, and, in
the history of pictorial journalism, unique record.
Yet, "His last appearance I" Can It bo possible? Is
permissible? "Look at this picture and on that.'" Compa
with his cartoon for this week any one of his most memorat
cartoons! Perfect in its classic design, as fresh in its fan<
and as vigorous as ever in its cxecntion, is it possible that th
is the last we are to see of his work? Will he do no mo
"cartoons"? No. Ho will not. The artist has decide
"Sic voJo, sic jubto." We do not doubt the wisdom of h
judgment, and we bow to his irrevocable decision. But though
the public is lost the charm of his graceful pencil, among i
his fellow-workers on "Mr. Punch's" staff, he remain
retaining his seat at our council-board, the historic tabl
ever most warmly welcome as "Our Jackides," that is,

paraphrase Falstaff, "JACKIDES with his familiars, JOHN -with
his relations, and Sir JOIJN TENNIEL to the -whole world."
So Sir JACKIDES, preux chevalier et sans reproche, hangs up his
pencil-sword, still bright with the polish of truo wit, which,
ever ready to bo drawn on the side of right, ho has never felt
himself called upon to use in self-defence. Would that, like
Proapero, he wero simply laying aside for a while his magic art
to resume it at -will.
JOHN TENNIEL summoned, at a critical moment, to join "the
Staff," by the lirst Editor MARK LEMON, was on it with DOUGLAS
JERKOLD, GILBERT ABBOTT ABECKETT, JOHN LEECH, SHIRLEY
BROOKS, and WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY. It is possible,
that, at some future time, Sir JACKIDES, as a courteous Nestor,
may reason with a youthful Atrides and newly elected Pelides,
each intolerant of the other's opinion, in his wise prototype's
words—
"You are not both, put both your years in one,
So old as I. I liv'd long since, and was companion
With men superior to you both, who yet would hear
My counsels with respect."
Whereupon the two heroes shall reconsider the matter, quietly
and calmly.
Sir JACKIDES will, I trust, pardon me, his fellow-worker during
nearly forty years, for writing this a son insu, but my excuse
is that ho would never have "consented to the deed" had
1 besought his leave and license. In the character of
"Manager," I plead the occasion as sufficient apology for my
appearanco, with these few inadequate words, before the
curtain which, by the time this number .appears, will have
already risen on the First Scene of the Great World-wide
Drama of The Now Century. F. C. B.
DUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
WERE the Baron asked, "What shall I give a youth or a mere
lioy as a New Year's present?" he would reply, " Kind Sir, or
good Madam, as the case may be, whether the youth, or mere boy,
has been good, bad, or indifferent, during the past year, I should
strongly recommend you to give him a Wiggin." And when
the liaron thus expresses himself ho would have it understood
that the "Wiggin" he means is Mrs. KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN,
•whoso two works, old friends, with new faces by Mr. CHARLES
BROCK, Penelope's English Experiences and Penelope's Experiences
in Scotland (GAY AND BIRD,—the very description for publishers
of such light and airy books) will be one of the delights of his
life. The Baron emphasizes them as "old friends," as they
first saw the light in 1893, but "the new faces," the pictures
in these books, endow them with a vitality that will consider-
ably extend tho popularity they have already achieved. The
name of tho artist, Mr. CHARI.KS BitocK, recalls one associated
-with artistic brilliancy :n IIreworks as is that of this present
artist with artistic brilliancy in apt and humorous illustration.
Dr. ROBERTSON Nicoi.L does well to bring out a new edition
of his James AliiedonfU, Journalist (HODI)KR & KTOUGHTON). It
is what it professes to be, the life of a journalist, "perhaps,"
he claims, "the only life of a journalist pure and simple ever
written." The materials are arranged with great skill, and the
story is told with that simplicity of style which seems so easy till
you try to reproduce it. My. Baronite remembers JAMES M.\c-
DONBLL in tho Press Gallery of the House of Commons and other
fields of work, a quietly mannered, earnest toiler who, starting
from the lowest rung of the journalistic ladder, worthily
reached the top.
The Baron is puzzled by the proven fact that, up to within a
very few weeks ago, ho had not heard of "Tho Rsv. P. A.
SIIKKIIAN, P.P., Donoraile, Diocese of Cloyne" the author of
My New Curate, a, book published (by MARTIN CALLAHAN & Co.)
in 1889, and which reached its eighth edition in October,
]!)00. Having hoard of it, to order it and receive it was
the work of a moment; to read it and enjoy it, at leisure,
was tho work, protracted on purpose, of several days.
No "scents of clerical life," not GEORGE ELLIOT'S, not
TROLLOPE'S, nor even the story of Monsieur L'ABBE
CONSTANTIN, have ever given the Baron so much honest,
healthy-minded, and purely high-comedy entertainment as is
provided, for all readers capable of appreciating such a work, by
this "Parish Priest of DonerailcDiocese." Hislatinity and his
delight in the classics reminds the Baron of THACKERAY'S friend,
Father PROUT. It is full of that quiet humour in pathos, of those
smiles amid tears, which are the touches of nature that make
the whole world kin, irrespective of creed and countiy. Not
infrequently was the stony-hearted Baron compelled to deposit
this book on his knee, search swiftly for his kerchief . . and
blow his nose vigorously. Ad lectores meos, "tolle lege!"
WHO'S who who says he can get along through daily life
without possessing a copy of Who's Who (A. & C. BLACK)? His
range of interests must be exceedingly narrow. When Lord
RANDOLPH CHURCHILL went out to Central Africa he took with
him a single book, Shakespeare. My Baronite, starting on
shorter journeys, makes a point of packing up Wlio 's Who, the
most compendious library of its kind known to him in single-
volume form. In the new edition is incorporated Men and
Women of the Time, an admirable -work in its way, long
since elbowed out of the field by its strenuous, up-to-date and
far more comprehensive rival. Messrs. BLACK also issU3 The
English Woman's Year-Book. It tells a woman everything she
wants to know, save how to get married. It is on a far loftier
plane than l/«it.
Miss ELLEN THORNEYCKOIT FOWLER leaped into fame by her
novel Concei-ning Isabel Caniaby, round which to-day rests the
pleasing halo of a seventeenth edition, completing the sale of
fifty thousand. My Baronite knew her earlier, and hailed her
genius as a writer of verse in some of the -weeklies. They are
brought together and published in a dainty volume, the text set
in good black typo within luxuriously broad margin. "Love's
Argument and Other Poems (HoDDER & STOUGHTON). The poems,
in many rhythms, have each something pointed to say, and the
point is well turned. It is high praise for a young writer in
verse to say that Miss FOWLER'S shows no trace of imitation of
established models. It's all her own, and very good, too.
THE BARON DE B.-W.
A FAREWELL.
TIME, who devours his children, now claims thee,
Poor dying Century! With eager pace
Tho New Ago hurries on to take thy place,
And thou goest forth into the Darkness. We,
Who knew and loved thee, turn reluctantly.
To the new comer's unfamiliar face,
Look in his eyes and strive in vain to trace
Thy likeness in tho features that we see.
In vain! W7hat there is shown none may descry.
But we can smile though skies be overcast,
Can front the future as we faced tho past,
And bear a light heart with us till we die,
Can find a laugh for the New Century,
And just one tear at parting with the Last!

fascinating bachelor, or widower, may induce the excellent lady
to change her name for his, but, of course, without ceasing

THE HOME-COMING OF THE CHIEF.
To PIELD-MAHKIIAL LOUD ROHKKTS, V.C.
January 2, 1C01.
Wm/'OMK, welcome, long desired!
Now the watching eyes aslrain
Over the misty-curtained main
Have the sight that sets at rest
Hearts the sport of hope and fear.
Now the signal-lights are fired;
Now with shattering thunder-shock
Battleship and cannon'd rock,
Booming out their iron cheor
Greet you where your vessel rides
Swinging on familiar tides
Off the land you love the best!
So for you the circled year
Hounds the term of labour wrought,
Victory snatched from out defeat,
Pledge redeemed as with a charm
J!y your skill of scheming thought
And the strong destroying arm.
Marshal of a mightier host
Than our conquering keels of oak
Kver lx>ro from Britain's coast,
Yours were yet tho nobler arts,
Where with Justice, swift of stroke,
Milder claims of Mercy moot.
Ho you come, long waited for,
While the gathering of the strands
Streaming from your web of war
Lies with other younger hands,
Younger hands and sterner hearts!
First before your Empress-Queen
You shall lay your laurels low;
Her whose hand has learned to lean
On your undimmcd •warrior-strength;
Her for whose dear honour's sake,
When tho nations laughed to know
England's lordship like to fall,
You obeyed tho instant call,
IXM! the van and turned tho day.
So, your warfare done, at length
Krom her lips you go to take
What of thanks a Queen may pay.
Next, saluted by tho port
Whence with heartening faith you fared
Toward your task beyond tho foam,
Now your haven, nearing home—
Come where she, through street and
Court,
Mother of Cities, hails her choice!
Come to us whose myriad voice
For tho year of dangers dared
Shall in one bright hour atone!
Come Ixmeath tho banners blown,
Down tho roar of serried ranks,
Heart* aglow with love and pride!
Come and hear your country's thanks!
Come, for she romombors well
How in that last winter-tide
When the night around her fell
All her hopes on you wore set
As upon a magic spell!
Should she, then, so soon forget?
Ah! but while a nation's cries
Storm against our sullen skies,
M iess and the mirth
Flung about your victor's way,
If behind the brave array
All the hidden heart were known,
Save for love of England's name
Gladly would you yield the prize,
Glory, triumph, wealth and fame,
Could you win one grace alone,
Could you have your boy again
Home from where he takes his rest
Lying under alien earth
By Colenso's dreadful plain
With the Cross above his breast!
O. S.
MOGGSON'S CHRISTMAS EVE.
MOCGSON was alone in his library. He
had been working hard till quite late in
the evening, and felt tired—too tired to
read. So be leant back in his chair, and
enjoyed the blaze from the lire. Now and
then he would take a look round at his
well-filled shelves. It was good to be
near so ^any friends—even though too
tired to converse with them; for one of
the rare joys of intimate friendship con-
sists in companionable silence.
So Moggson smoked and thought—no,
thought is too severe an expression; he let
tho mental reins go slack, so that his fancy
should carry him wheresoever she willed.
His gaze wandered to tho far corner of
the, room where a number of new books,
written specially for Christmas time, had
threatened by their smart appearance and
fashionable ways to eclipse altogether a
few, well-worn, shabby old friends, who
had been there for years. Hml threatened!
Yes, but surely . It was odd.
MOGGSON rubbed his eyes. In the fire-
light the new-comers seemed to have lost
their brightness and alertness. They
looked positively insignificant. And,
curiously enough, there was a strange
brightness about an odd, old-fashioned
little chap at the end of the shelf. A
murmur of disgust came from the new-
comers. MOUIISOK caught the words.
"Hopelessly out of date." "Such bad
taste, dressing like that." "Never mind"
—(this from one of the latest arrivals—he
had looked a gorgeous fellow, now he
seemed draggled and miserable)—" that
vulgar little chap in the red coat."
MOGGSON was interested. He rose and
walked towards the shelves. The odd
little chap in tho corner was chuckling:
certainly he looked old-fashioned enough,
yet there was a strange glow of vitality
about him which his spick-and-span
companions lacked.
MOGGSON was delighted. Here was the
right comrade for him. He felt ashamed
that he had paid so little attention to him
lately. "Come and chat with me, will
you?" he said. The little chap sprang
off the shelf. His movements were
grotesque, and his dress certainly open to
criticism. Yet MOGGSO.V felt amazingly
at homo with him, and at some observa-
tion he put back his head and laughed as
he hadn't laughed for months. How the
hours sped on. The fire was replenished
and he listened to his friend talking.
Sometimes he would laugh, till some of the
serious friends on the shelves almost died
of disgust; at other times the laugh got
mixed up with an odd feeling in the throat;
and things lookedalittlc dimfora moment
or so; until another laugh came, and
*****
Ho opened his eyes. The grey dawn
gave the flickering gas lamps outside a
slate background. MOGGSON stretched
himself and looked at the book on his
lap, "A CHRISTMAS CAROL." "Men,
women and children of England," said
MOGGSON, addressing an imaginary au-
dience, "let me give you a Christmas
toast. Here's to the gentleman who has
discovered the secret of perpetual youth—
CHARLES DICKENS!" A. R.
SPORTIVE SONGS.
(An Old Fogey addresses his Great-Ncplicw
on the JVeu> Year.)
I MAY not sing tho New Year's praise,
E'en though a century begins.
No! I look back on other days,
On bygono virtues, bygone sins;
On decades that went all too fast,
Though now they are so very slow.
Give me (he ne'er forgotten Past,
The tips and downs of Long Ago!
Then men were brave and women fair,
I don't deny they 're so to-day,
But is Life now so <Jc6onmi.tr,
And arc its serfs so blithe and gay?
Why did the World seem then so bright.
Why did we quaff our wine, not sip?
Well, some folk like electric light,
Give me the good old tallow dip!
You much prefer a touzled head
Above a figure limp and lean!
Give me tho visage plump and red
That beamed above a crinoline!
Give me the Dandy's splendid glare
That proudest damsels could abash,
For such a being can't compare
With half-bred screws, who live on
"mash."
Wo backed our fancy with a will:
Begad! tho money used to fly,
And though our judgment might be nil,
We wagered on it, "do or die ";
But you young fellows don't e'en go
To see how racing flyers shape.
At home you all are " in the know,"
And lawyer-like, employ re(a)d "tape."
And then wo fought—Yes! we could fight,
Face odds with stern, determined brow,
Stand up as one for Britain's right.
Can you do this who battle now?
What's this I read? "Each stubborn rank"
'Gainst three to one the Boer can't tir^
Here, put this cheque into your bank. (
And put this doggrel in the flre.

YULE-TIDE PAST AND PRESENT.
(A Couple of Specimens.)
SPECIMEN No. 1. OLD STYLE.
NKVER was there such a merry time.
The walls huiig with holly and mistletoe
glistened in the soft candle-light. The j
party included everyone. There were
grandpa and grandma, and the Colonel and
the Captain R.N., and numbers of grand-
children, nephews, nieces and cousins
twice removed. It was Yule-tide —
glorious Yule-tide — season of happy
goodwill.
How they danced! LTow they travelled
down the centre of the hall. How the
musicians in the gallery played Sir Roger
de Coverley until they nearly dropped
asleep from sheer fatigue. Indeed, in-
deed, it was a right merry time.
And how the portraits of the ancestors
smiled from their canvases! Generation
after generation of statesmen, warriors
and divines. There they were, beaming on
their descendants.
And the dinner! Ah, that was the time
for mirth. How they laughed! How they
pledged one another! How the entire
family—from the senior of seventy to the
junior of five — met together to frater-
nise!
"I am glad to see you all!" cried the
white-headed host. "Why, my dear re-
latives? Why, because it is Christinas!"
SPECIMEN No. 2. MODERN.
They were seated facing one another in
the coffee-room of the hotel. They had
left town for about a week and were
quietly enjoying themselves.
"Glad to escape the family circle,''
said he.
"Quito so," was her laconic response.
The waiter had served them with the
regulation table-d'hote dinner. They had
come to the sweets.
"Which will you have, Madam, mince-
pie or plum-pudding."
"What an odd iiienu!" he exclaimed.
"Why do they give us such indigestible
dishes?"
"Can't say, Sir," replied the waiter.
Then he hazarded. "It may be, Sir,
because it is Christinas."

Drink out Sir WILFRID'S sober rhymes,
But drink the " fuller " minstrel in.
Drink in the complaisant J.P.,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Drink out a dull and sober land,
Drink in the vice that is to be.
"WUAT! HARE !" — Widely,! and as a
rule favourably reviewed, are the three
concluding " volumes, iv. to vi." (a very
good time in the day for reading) of
AUGUSTUS J. C. HAKE'S Story of my Life.
It seems, judging from the notices, that
Mr. HARE might with greater accuracy
have styled the work "Stories of other
people's lives," and have appended to it
the alternative title of "The Hare and
many friends." Such a book, while im-
parting to its readers a quantity of more
or less useful or entertaining knowledge,
must contain a considerable amount of
padding, which need not, in this instance
be heavy, but might consist of "Trifles,
light as Hare."

A CHRISTMAS CAROL.
"SlNG a song of Christmas,"
The Editor did cry,
"Of turkey and plum-pudding
And endless revelry."
When the song was opened
He found this little thing—
Wasn't it a funny song
For a Christmas bard to sing?
"When the postman daily fills
My letter-box with Christmas bills,
When with winning smile he knocks
For his wonted Christmas box,
When the duns are at my door,
Asking more and more and more,
When from their wiles I vainly fly,
Then doth my harassed spirit cry,
Though Christmas comes but once a
year,
Once too often it is here.
"When the Christmas snow and sleet
Permeate my frozen feet,
When the Christmas ' fln' doth rack
Legs and arms and bones and back,
When with feet in mustard cruel
I am sipping Christmas gruel,
Then as I groan and cough and sneeze,
Through my red-hot throat I wheeze,
Though Christmas comes but once a
year,
Once too often it is here."
A STORY OP THE LONG.
(Told in the Short Vacation.)
IT was in Bristol City. A Representa-
tive of tho Sago of Bouverie Street met
the Poor _nd Disreputable Member of the
Family. As usual, the Disreputable Ono
was committing his popular atrocities
be ere an enthusiastic audience. The
spectators were of tender years, but, in
spite of their School Board training,
cheered to the echo the slaughter of the
wife, the murder of tho son and heir, the
crushing of the policeman, the undoing of
the clown, and the final.triumphiovenOld
Bogey.
"But where is the dog?" asked a
Representative.
"He 's been sacrificed, Sir, for the good
of the Public," replied the Disreputable
One's Business Manager.
"What do you mean by that?"
"That when they put his muzzle on
Sir, he could not bite tho nose of his
employer."
• "Oh, that's the short of it, is it?"
"Well, no, Sir; I should say it was
more Long than Short."
And when the story was narrated that
evening at the annual dinner of the local
Press Fund in the presence of the Presi-
dent of the Board of Agriculture (late
President of the Local Government Board)
it went with roars. Three cheers for
Bristol City.

THE FESTIVE SEASON.

TO THE NEW CENTURY.
NKW century, whom now we greet,
Upon your threshold gladly standing,
Come with your blessings, we entreat,
Over the world your reign expanding;
We, with old pains and griefs depressed,
Hail you a glad and welcome guest.
Rich, glorious times we hope to get
Out of your store before you leave us;
We possibly shall catch DK WET,
Microbes may haply cease to grieve us,
And, inaybo, London thoroughfare's
Shall some day finish their repairs.
And those whose roving fancies turn
To the North Pole perchance may reach
it;
Teetotalers at least may learn
True temperance as well as teach it;
Thus many a hope, with longing eyes,
We look to you to realise.
Yet if for ills that we endure
The remedy in vain we ask you,
New century, of this wo 're sure,
That when our sons in turn shall task you
With all the ills wherewith they 're vexed
They '11 hope to lose them in tho next.

DEAMATJC SEQUELS.
I.— THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL.
WHEN Mr. SYDNEY GRUNDY'S Comedy
A Debt of Honour was being given recently
at the St. James's Theatre, Mr. ALEXANDER
had the happy idea of playing after it a
drama in one act by the same author,
showing the further fortunes of the
characters in the piece. This idea of
dramatic sequels is one which seems
capable of further extension. For ex-
ample, we have ourselves prevailed upon
the Shade of Sheridan to provide a sequel
to The School for Scandal. It is called:
THE RELAPSE OF LADY TEAZLE.
SCENE—Room in Sir PETER TKAZLE'S house.
Sip PKTER and Lady TEAZLE discovered
wrangling as in Act II.
Sir P. Lady TEAZLE, Lady TEAZLE, I '11
not bear it.
Lady T. Sir PETER, Sir PETER, you've
told me that a hundred times. This habit
of repeating yourself is most distressing.
'Tis a sure sign of old age.
Sir P. (in o passion). Oons, madam, will
you never be tired of flinging my age in
my face?
Lady T. Lud, Sir PETER, 'tis you that
fling it in mine. How often have you said
tome (beating time) "when an old bachelor
marries a young wife
Sir P. And if I have, Lady TEAZLE, you
needn't repeat it after me. But you live
only to plague me. And yet 'twas but six
months ago you vowed never to cross me
again. Yes, madam, six months ago, when
I found you concealed behind a screen in
Mr. SURFACE'S library, you promised that
if I would forgive you your future con-
duct should prove the sincerity of your
repentance. I forgave you, Madam, and
this is my reward!
Lady T. And am I to blame, Sir PETER,
for your ill-humours? Must I always be
making concessions? To please you, I have
given up all routs and assemblies, attend
no balls nor quadrilles, talk no scandal,
never ogle nor flirt. I go no more to my
Lady SNEERWELL'S, though I vow her's
was a most delightful house to visit. Such
fashion and elegance! Such wit! Such
delicate malice!
Sir P. (fretfully). Just so, Madam; that
is what I complain of. All the while you
are longing to return to these follies.
You are not happy when you are alone
with me.
lady T. Groat heavens, Sir PETER; you
must not ask for miracles. What woman
of fashion is ever happy alone with her
husband?
Sir P. There it is, Lady TEAZLE. You
think only of fashion. And yet, when I
married you
Lady T. (yawning). Lud, Sir PETER, why
will you be always returning to that pain-
ful subject?
Sir P. Vastly painful, no doubt, Madam,
since it prevents you from marrying Mr.
SURFACE, behind whose screen I found
yon.
Ij'ulti T. (yawning more heartily). Mr.
SURFACE? But 'twas CHARLES you used to
suspect.
Sir P. (angrily.) And now 'tis JOSEPH.
Zounds, Madam, is a man never to be
allowed to change his mind? (liaising his
voice in fury) I say 'tis JOSEPH! JOSEPH!!
JOSEPH!! 1
Enter JOSEPH SURFACE. Sir PETER and
Lady TEAZLE are obviously discon-
certed a this inopportune arrival, and
say nothing. JOSEPH IMS greatly changed
in appearance in the six months which
nave elapsed between the play and the
sequel. He has lost his sleekness and
his air of conscious virtue, and looks
like a careless, good-humoured man-
about-town.
Joseph (obviously enjoying their discom-
fort). Sir PETER, your servant. Lady
TEAZLE, your most obedient (bou>s tnocfc-
ingly).
Sir P. (stiffly). To what, Mr. SURFACE,
do we owe the honour of this visit?
Joseph (blandly, correcting him). Plea-
sure, Sir PKTER.
Sir P. (testily). I said " honour," Sir.
Joseph (easily). I came at the invitation
of Sir OLIVER, who is staying in your
house. He desired to see me.
Lady T. (viciously, to Sir P.). If this
gentleman's business is with Sir OLIVER,
perhaps he will explain why he has
intruded in this room.
Joseph (amused). With pleasure. My
attention was arrested by the sound of
voices raised in dispute. I heard my
name mentioned loudly more than once,
and, recognizing one of the voices as
that of Lady TEAZLE (with a low bow), I
thought it better to interpose to defend
my character at once.
Lady T. (stamping her foot). Insolent!
Sir P. (chuckling). Ha, ha! Very good.
I' faith, Mr. SURFACE, I could almost find
it in my heart to forgive you for your
injuries towards me when you talk like
that.
Joseph. Injuries, Sir PETER? I never
did you an injury. That affair of the
screen was the merest misunderstanding.
I had no serious desire to capture the
affections of Lady TEAZLE. On the con-
trary, 'twould have been highly incon-
venient for me. 'Twas yonr ward MARIA
that I wished to win.
Lady T. Monster!
Joseph (continuing.) Unhappily, Lady
TEAZLE mistook the nature of my atten-
tions and I, knowiug her temper (bowing to
Lady T.), feared to undeceive her lest she
should use her influence to prejudice me
in the eyes of your ward. That, Sir PETER,
is the true explanation of the situation in
which you found Lady TEAZLE on that
unlucky morning.
Lady T. (iinth suppressed fury). Pray,
Sir PETER, do you propose to continue to
permit this gentleman to speak of me in
this way?
Sir P. Certainly, Madam. Everything
that Mr. SURFACE has said seems to me
to bear the stamp of truth.
Lady T. Ah!
Joseph. So, you see, Sir PETER, you never
had any real cause of jealousy towards me.
My conduct was foolish, I admit, but it
was never criminal.
Sir P. JOSEPH, I believe you. Give me
your hand. Six months ago I thought you
guilty of the basest treachery towards me.
But a year of marriage with Lady TEAZLE
has convinced me that, in her relations
with you as in her relations with me, it
is always Lady TEAZLE who is in the
wrong! [They shake hands irarmly.
Lady T. I will not stay hero to be in-
sulted in this manner. I will go straight
to Lady SNEERWELL'S, and tear both your
characters to tatters.
[Exit in a violent passion.
Sir P. Oons, what a fury! But when an
old bachelor marries a young wife
Joseph. Come, come, Sir PKTER, no senti-
ments!
Sir P. What you say that! My dear
JOSEPH, this is indeed a reformation.
Had it been CHARLES now, I should not
have been surprised.
Joseph. Egad, Sir PETER, in the matter
of sentiments CHARLES, for a long time,
had a most unfair advantage of me. For,
having no character to lose he had no need
of sentiments to support it. But now I
have as little character as he, and we
start fair. Now I am a free man; I say
what I think, do what I please. Scandal
has done its worst with me, and I no
longer fear it. Whereas, when I had a
character for morality to maintain, all
my time was wasted in trying to live up
to it. I had to conceal every trifling
flirtation, and had finally wrapped myself
in such a web of falsehood thai when
your hand tore away the veil, I give you
my word, I was almost grateful. Depend
upon it, Sir PETER, there 's no possession
in the world so troublesome to the owner
as a good reputation.
Sir P. (digging him in the ribs). Ah,
JOSEPH, you 're a sad dog. But here comes
your uncle, Sir OLIVEII. I'll leave you
with him. | /•>;'/.
Enter Sir OLIVER, reading a alieaf of legal
documents.'
SirO. (reading). Eighty, ("fie hundred and
twenty, two hundred and'.twenty, three
hundred pounds '. Gad, the' dog will ruin
me. \
Joseph. Sir OLIVER, your servant.
Sir O. (looking up). Eh? i Is that you,
Nephew. Yes, I remember. I sent for
you.
Joseph. You are busy Ishis morning,
Uncle. I '11 wait upon you another day.

to say that T had decided to pardon your
past misconduct and restore you to favour.
Six months of CHARLES'S society have
convinced me of the folly of adopting a
reprobate.
Joseph. I thought they would, Uncle.
Sir 0. Your brother's extravagances
pass all bounds. Hero are four writs
•which were served upon him but yester-
day. And the fellow has the assurance
to send them on to me. (Joseph laughs
heartily.) Zounds, Nephew, don't stand
chuckling there. And his character has
not reformed one whit, in spite of his pro-
mises. His flirtations with my Lady
SXEKRWELL and others are so excessive
that MARIA has quite thrown him over,
and the engagement is broken off. Add
to this that I have paid his debts three
times, only to find him contracting fresh
liabilities, and you may judge that my
patience is exhausted.
Joseph. But these are old stories,
Uncle. You tnew that CHARLES was
vicious and extravagant when you made
him your heir. Ho has done nothing fresh
to offend you.
Sir O. On the contrary. He has done
something which has hurt me deeply.
Jose;Ji. How absurd of him, Uncle,
when he knows that he is dependent
wholly on your bounty!
Sip 0. Wait till you have heard the
whole story. A week ago your brother
came to me for money to meet some
gambling debt. I refused him. Where-
upon, he returned to his house, had in
an auctioneer and sold everything that
it contained.
Joseph (much amused). And did you
play little Premium a second time,
Uncle?
Sir O. (testily). Certainly not, Sir. On
this occasion I left the rogue to settle
matters for himself.
Joseph. Hut I see no great harm in this.
Why should not CHARLES sell his furni-
ture?
Sir 0. (angrily). Deuce take his furni-
ture. He sold my picture!
Joseph. What, "the ill-looking little
fellow over the settee "?
Sir 0. Yes.
Joseph. Ha! ha! ha! Delicious! Sold
his Uncle's portrait! Gad, I like his
spirit.
Sir 0. You seem vastly entertained,
Nephew!
Joseph. I confess the humour of the
situation appeals to me.
Sir O. Happily for you I am less easily
amused. No, no; CHARLES is a heartless
scoundrel, and I '11 disown him.
Joseph. No, no, Uncle. He 's no worse
than other young men.
Sir 0. But he sold my picture!
Joseph. He was pressed for money.
Sir 0. (exasperated). But he sold my
picture!!
Joseph. Ho meant no harm, I '11 be
bound.
Sir 0. (still more enraged). But he sold
my picture!!!
[Enter Sir PETER hurriedly, looking pale
and disordered.
Joseph. My clear Sir PBTKU, you are ill!
You have had bad news?
Sir O. Sir PETER, old friend, what is it?
Sir T. (gasping). Lady TEAZLE
[Stops, choked with passion.
Sir O. Not dead?
Sir P. Dead ! Hell and furies! if it were
only that! No; run away with your pro-
fligate Nephew CHARLES!
Joseph. Impossible!
Sir 0. Is this certain?
Sir P. Aye. ROWLEY saw them driving
together in a postchaise towards Richmond,
not ten minutes ago.
Sir 0. Then I disown him. JOSEPH, you
are my heir. But see that you behave
yourself or I '11 disinherit you, too, and
leave my money to a missionary society.

A BALLADE OP DREADFUL DISEASES.
THODGH the season of Christmas by right should be gay,
Yet the outlook is certainly black,
For most dreadful diseases will come in our way,
Though the crackers may merrily crack.
Though we claim happy days by consuming a stack
Of mince-pies—and we all of us try—'tis
Quito certain that few will avoid the attack
Of some malady ending in "—itis."
Just to take an occurrence of every day,
"Which the wet weather brings in its track,
A sore throat, with a rather bad cough, let us say,
Of the kind that professes to "hack "—
Well, the owner is cheerfully placed on the rack,
For his doctor, ignoring his fright, is
Afraid he '11 be thought an incompetent quack
If he doesn't say "Bad laryngitis!"
To this proposition, then, none can say nay,
Of strange maladies there is no lack,
And alcoholitis, the prophets all say,
Will be prevalent during the "vac."
For hundreds of people possessing the knack—
I 'm not quite prepared to say why 'tis—
Love to talk by the yard, with a medical smack,
Of their own or their friends somethingitis!
Envoi.
Boys, at Christmas take only a moderate "whack,"
For the horrible truth which I write is
That you can't have an old-fashioned bilious attack—
Yon '11 be laid up with plumpuddingitis!
NEW CENTURY GREETINGS.
THERE is reason to believe that some of the Ministers, un-
willing that Lord LANSDOWNE'S French, so frequently men-
tioned, should seem to be the only linguistic achievement of
the Cabinet, have written the following letters.
The Lord Privy Seal to Count Billow, Berlin.

derbar! Wennjemand fragt warum er Foreign Secretary ist,

meisterhaft, so prachtvoll spricht und schreibt." Viele Lcute
denken dass es nicht genug ist, und sic sagen es sind Kellner

MUY SENOR MlO,—Mi amigo LANSDOWNE puede escribir francos.
Yo want to escribir espafiol. Muy difficult. Yo don't like

airs. Mi tio SALISBURY pensa no end of LAXSDOWNE, and
his precious French. Spanish is useful now to translate
"guerrillas," which even the Times, in a leading article, seems
to think means men, as though we called the Boers " campaigns,"
or "raids." I know it ought to be "guerrilleros," porque yo
aprendo cspafiol. Yo amo Espana, porque el rey es uno child,
como yo. Yo dije en el House of Commons, "I am a child in
these matters." ALFONZO y yo, nosotros both of us arc children.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
CONVERSATIONAL HINTS TO YOUNG EIDEES.
CHAPTER III.
(Of Scenl—Of Adolphus \Yinterside, his dress, deportment, and
conversation—Mi's opinion of imagination and poets.)
WE •will now put aside the reminiscences of childhood, and
in imagination wo will take horse on a fine hunting day (and
as balmy as May), and make our way to tho meet of the hounds.
The sun is shining, a clearsun, striking jewels of light from the
damp earth and the trees. There is refreshment in the air,
though the month is December, and Nature looks as if she had
taken a hearty shower-bath and forgotten to dry herself. As
wo near tho trysting place our
party increases, and cheery
good-days are exchanged by
the cavalcade. What is tho
chief topic? Why, of course,
it is SCENT — not the en-
trancing essences supplied by
tho most eminent of our per-
fumers, but the elusive,
baffling, unaccountable, subtle
quality that makes or mars
the success of a hunting day.
Who is there that really knows
anything about it? Who can
say, without fear of finding
himself flatly contradicted by
the event, that in certain con-
ditions of weather the scent
will or will not be good? For
hundreds of years men have
been hunting in dry weather,
in wet weather, in warm
weather, in cold weather,
when the fields arc deep with
moisture, and even when snow
is on the ground (one of the
most glorious runs I remember
was over snow), and yet no one
has been able to settle a for-
mula, or even a series of for-
iii n In-, which shall enable a man
to foretell what tho scent will
be like when he takes the field.
Are not learned articles every
year in the Field, in Baily's
Magazine, and in the Badmin-
ton, devoted to this subject,
and can anyone, with all re-
spect for the erudite and gallant authors say that, after
reading them, his ignorance on this engrossing matter is one
whit less extensive and peculiar? There is the fascination of
it. Nobody knows, and, therefore, as to this point, at any
rate, it is no vain boast to say that in the hunting field all men
are equal.
But let us edge up to the young ADOLPHUS WINTERSIDE, one of

country gentlemen devoted to the chase? Has he not lived for
sport from his earliest years, spending a great part of his
boyhood in the mild and magnificent eyes of masters, of hunts-
men and of whips? Hear him, then, as he converses.
Adolphus. Good morning, Miss MIHABEL. Ripping day,
isn't it?
Miss M. Yes, quite lovely. I do so hope we shall get a
run. We 're only pottered about from covert to covert
tho last three times I 've been out, and never managed to get
away.
Adolphus. Well, wo 're bound to find in Hollytree Wood.
Never drew it yet without finding at least one fox; and as
he'll probably make for Whitethorns we shall have a jolly
grass country with good clean
jumping. Oh! yes, we shall get
a run right enough — if tho
scent lies.
Miss M. Ah, of course; but
isn't there sure to be scent on
a day like this?
Adolphus. 'Pon my honour,
Miss MIRABEL, you'd better
ask me another, for I can't
tell you. I remember days
exactly like this, when a ton
of aniseed spread out;in front
of their noses wouldn't have
made tho hounds give a sniff.
You can't tell, that's a fact.
Scent's one of those jolly
mysterious things, like tho
what-you-may-call-'em cal-
culus, or the maps with that
old chap Mercator's projec-
tion. Lots of fellows talk

What F.-M. Punch \vnnts to know is what happened between
1st of October and 21st of December to compel this reversal of
decision taken by Lord LANSDOWNE, acting upon the finding of the
Army Board? Had fresh evidence been brought to light? If so,
was it communicated to the accused, and opportunity^afforded
him of rebutting it? General COLVILB, in his published state-
ment, says no such opportunity was offered to him.
A telegram from Capetown states that, subsequent to the War
Office enquiry, Colonel SPRAGGB submitted to the authorities a
telegram which reached him on the 23rd of May. It was dated
from Lindley, and purported to be from General COLVILK, urging
him to hurry up to his men to Lindley as fast As possible. If
this telegram were genuine and General COLVILE, having sum-
moned the Yeomanry to strengthen his command, had left
them in the lurch, he deserves the professional ruin with which
he is threatened. But there is a little fact that upsets this
argument. Colonel SPRAGGE received the Lindley telegram on
the 28rd of May, and General COLVILE did not reach Lindley
till the 26th. The slim Boer may be able to explain this
mystery. Certainly General COLVILE did not send the tele-
gram; had not, indeed, heard of Colonel SPRAOGE till, on the
morning of the 28th, he received his appeal for help.
These are the uncontested facts. F.-M. Punch makes no re-
mark upon them beyond the obvious •><><•. that for the honour
of the Army and the credit of the War Office the matter cannot
be allowed to rest where the Secretary of State's dismissal
of General COLVILE leaves it.

THE STRANGE CASE OF GENERAL COLVILE.
F.-M. PCNCH having at heart the true interests of the
based as they largely are upon justice to officers and men, has
been looking into the case of General Sir HKNRY COLVILK.
Avoiding controversy, sticking closely to facts, as is tho
F.-M.'s manner, it may be briefly stated:'
On the 20th of May, General COLVILE, in command of a
division of the Army in South Africa, was ordered by Lord
ROBERTS to march to Heilbron, reaching that point on the 29th.
Fighting his way through Lindley he, when half-way between
that place and his destination, received a message from Colonel
SPHAGGE, in command of 500 Yeomanry, asking for help. General
COLVILE had his orders to be in Heilbron on a particular day.
He had reason to believe his march was part of a concerted
movement, which would bo baulked if ho did not turn up on
the appointed date. Rightly or wrongly, he continued his
march, and the Yeomanry, overpowered by numbers, surren-
dered to the Boers. The circumstances of the case being
considered by the Army Board of the War Office, General
COLVILE was permitted to resume his command at Gibraltar.
Up to this point it is all plain marching. Now we torn into
Queer Street. In accordance with instructions from the War
OUicc, General COLVILE on the 1st of October resumed his com-
mand at Gibraltar. On the 21st of December there reached
him a sort of Christmas card from Sir EVELYN WOOD, informing
him that Mr. BRODRICK—who, in the meantime, had succeeded
Lord LANSDOWNE at the War Office—held him responsible for the
Lindley affair, and dismissed him from his command.
A PETTY FOGGER.
(By a llisanthroplst.)
SOME of us like the sunshine, some of us like the rain,
Some of us love the moonlight, some of us love the main;
These are fancies that our brain-wheels set ever and aye agog,
But consistently and perfectly give me a London fog!
'Twas meant for a fellow morose, with a visage grim and dour
And a voice acidulated as an unripe lemon's sour,
With a rind that can match its denseness in the thickness of
Never-be,
And a kind of a lost intensenoss in the Kingdom of Xever-see.
What matters to me the howling of the destitute drunken dog
Who has lost his way in the noisome spray that distils this
London fog;
His yells are to me the sweeter because I am left alone,
And the castaway cannot venture to dispute with me my bone;
I rejoice when Londoners flounder in a sort of Serbonian bog.
I 'm a brute and beast inhuman, but I do love a London fog!

SIR JOHN AIHD, BART.—The New Century has commenced well
with the bestowal of a Baronetcy upon the Member for Padding-

AlKD. Amongst the important public works he has carried out
at home and abroad, his hustling of old Father NILE, compelling
him to evenly distribute his favours over thirsty Egypt, will,
when completed, rank highest. But he always had a winning
way with water, as is shown by the Staines Reservoir, and the
new Docks at Southampton. We ought to have Aird of this
recognition before. But it's never too late to be a Baronet.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE
BY MAJOR W. P. DRURY.
A ZIG-ZAG of steel-blue flre licked out from the inky cloud
above Yes Tor, and Mr. PAGETT and I Involuntarily withdrew
from the red-curtained lattice whence we had been watching
the storm's approach.
"A flash o' lightnin'," he began, "always "minds me --"
It was the formula with which my host, the ex-Private of
Marines, invariably began the narration of his very moving
experiences by flood and field, though in this instance its con-
clusion was lost in the thunderclap which shook the "Coach
and Horses" to its ancient granite foundations. As the
muttering echoes died among the Dartmoor gorges I called to
mind the tattered Pilgrim's Progress on the best parlour table,
the green and yellow lizard on the sunlit garden wall, the
village doctor at his surgery door, and a dozen unconsidered
trifles which had furnished a great artist with material for his
finest masterpieces. Thrusting my tobacco pouch into the
artist's hands, I drew a couple of high-backed chairs before the
fire, and — with reference to certain arrangements upon the
table — requested him to say "when."
He said it on the instant, and before the golden fluid in the
lower half of the tumbler had grown appreciably paler. Then,
having assured himself that the blessed miller, as he expressed it,
had not been drowned, ho plunged with military directness into
the strange narrative which it is my privilege to make public.
"It so "appencd," ho began. "that on a certain red rot night
about 'alf a dozen years back I was employed by Her Majesty on
'ighly responsible and very 'arassin' dooty at a spot some ten
thousand milos south-cast o' Plymouth Sound. The spot was
the 'arbour of Batavia, in the groat Dutch island o' Java: and
the dooty — which was that of cabin-door sentry aboard the
second-class cruiser Dook o' York — was 'arassin' by reason o'
the heat, and more than usually responsible on account of the
Dutch adm'ral dinin' that evenin' with our skipper. Ever
since I flrst saw Queen WlLLYMlNOK's pretty face on a ha'penny
box o' matches I 've always thought that, next to bein' a British
Marine, I 'd like to be a Dutch one: and it pleased me to think
that one of her adm'rals was, in a manner o' speakin', eatin'
his dinner under the charge of Private PAGETT."
My gallant host glanced sentimentally at a coloured print of
the young Queen of Holland which, in company with one of his
la-wfnl sovereign, adorned the overmantel of the best parlour.
But a bnxom lady in the bar happening at that moment to glance
through the glass partition in our direction, he hastily shifted
his gaze to the flre and continued the story.
"Although the conversation at the dinner -table was in
English, for the flrst hour or so I could pick up nothing worth
repeatin' on the lower deck. In spite o' the champagne wine
they wore strikin' down by the quart, the talk was as "eavy to
listen to as the Times noospaper is to read. But no sooner 'ad
the Dutch adm'ral got a cigar between his teeth than he began
to grow confidential, and after a bit ho told our skipper a piece
o' noos that I '11 lay to it he 'd 'nve given a year's sea wages in
the mornin' to recall. As for me, I knocked off that ridic'Ious
farce of walkin' my post in a soldierlike manner, and stood
stric'ly at ease as near the open cabin door as possible, in order
that when I was relieved my messmates might "ave the benefit
o' the noos as well.
"' Latitood nine, thirteen south,' the adm'ral was savin',
'and longitood one 'nndred an' four east. It was reborted to
me this morgeu by the captain of a— how say you ?— ja, tramp.
Four 'undred miles sou'-west of Sunda Straits he was when he
passed the islant. Yet no islant at all, my frient, is shown in
that bart o' the ocean on your Adm'ralty jarts!'
"'I'll back our Adm'ralty charts, all the same,' says the
skipper, 'uffylike, ' against the diseased imagination of a tipsy-
mauiao master of a tramp! I don't believe in that there
island,' he says,' no more than I believe in the man in the moon.'
"'Novorthemore,' says the Dutchman, risin' with onsteady
dignity from the table, 'to-morrow I go to annegs it in the
name o' WlLLYMINOR, by the grace of God Queen o' the Nether-
lands.'
"'I wish Her Majesty joy of her noo possession,' says our
skipper sarcaustically, bowin' his guest up the after ladder.
1 By the way, what did you say Its position was on the chart?'
"' My dear frient,' says the adm'ral, steppin" into his
barge, 'what can it madder, since it only exists in the de-
ceased imagination of a dibsymaniac?' At which the skipper
swore very softly to hisself.
"A few minutes after returnin' to his cabin, 'owever, he
rang the bell.
"' Sir?' says I, answerin' it.
"'Take these orders,' says he, 'to the flrst lootenant and
chief engineer ;' and with that he turns in.
"Then there was more soft swoarin'—from the wardroom
an' lower-deck messes this time. For the orders to the flrst
lootenant were to unmoor and be ready for sea by day-light,
while the chief engineer was to 'ave steam for ten knots by
the same hour. Which meant that at least two-thirds o' the
ship's comp'ny 'ad to put off their Toosday night's rest till
the followin' Sunday afternoon.
"Under the mistaken impression that we were "omeward
bound, the band o' the Dutch flagship played us out of 'arbour
next mornin' to the toon of ' Beautiful Isle o' the Sea.' But
it was a younger isle than old England we were bound for;
and, as soon as we 'ad crawled out o' sight, instead of keopin'
on our course for Signapore the 'elm was jammed 'ard a-star-
board, the injin-room telegraph sot at 'full speed ahead,' and
in a few hours we were racin' at ten an' a quarter knots
through the Straits o' Sunda towards the Indian Ocean. When
we reached the open, the skipper put the ship on a sou'-
westorly course, and—sent for me."
"For you?"
"Not for the First Lord o' the Adm'ralty," explained Mr.
PAGETT wearily, "but for me. 'You 'ad the flrst watch on the
cabin door last night?' says the skipper. 'I 'ad,' says I. 'I
misremember," ho says, lookin' me 'ard in the face, 'the esac'
longitood and latitood o' that there island.' 'Nine, thirteen
south,' says I, 'by one 'undrod and four east.' ''Ow do you
know?' he asks. 'I wrote it down on the af t-deok paintwork,'
I says, 'with my trigger finger,1 I says, 'dipped in some corfy
your stooard was carryin* into the cabin at the time." 'Then
you'll probably get fourteen days from the first lootenant,'
he says, ' for spoilin' his paint, and fourteen more from me for
listenin' to international conf'rences. Now you can go.'
"But when in the dawn two days afterwards the island lay
right athwart our course, the skipper sends for me on the fore
bridge and gives me the lance stripe instead. It was after-
wards took from me, you may recollec', for lettin' the jib sheet
jam when Lootenant PRINGLE was sail in' that there train across
the Isthmus «.' Paria in Venezuela.
"Now, if the Dutch adm'ral 'ad seen that forsaken island,
maybe he wouldn't 'ave talked so big about annexiif it for
Queen WILT.YMINOR, God bless her! It was no sort of present
for a lady—let alone a Queen, bein' nothin' but a flat, irreg'lar
patch of rock an' shingle about 'alf a mile long, and lookin'
like an inkstain in the middle of a blue silk tablecloth."
"I suppose you went back again," I hazarded, seeing that ho
paused.
"If you suppose the ship and everybody in her but the
Marines," rejoined Mr. PAGETT moodily, "yon suppose right.
In order to make the Dutch adm'ral swear on his arrival, the
skipper caused the entire detachment, from me an' Lootenant
JANNAWAY down to the drummer, to parade in our best scarlet
iconics, and then landed us as a 'garrison of occupation.' We

took -with us a large mining marquee for the men, a couple o'
bell tents for Lootenant JANNAWAY an' the colour-sergeant,
our arms an' accoutrements, a week's rations, and the tallest
spar and biggest Union Jack we 'ad In the ship. After hoistin'
the colours with his own 'and an' proclaimin' the island part o'
the British Empire, the Marines presented arms, and the skipper
returned on board: and an hour later the Dook o' York was iull
down on the north-eastern 'orizon.
"We pitched the tents, laid out our beddin', cleaned our
arms an' accoutrements, cooked and 'ad our dinners, lit our
pipes, and lay down in the shade till evenin'. Then JANNAWAY,
who was a born Marine and would 'ave 'arassed pore castaways
upon a raft, ordered us to fall in for drill.
"The ground mightn't 'ave. been as smooth as the parade in
Plymouth barricks, but it was certainly roomier than theDoofc's
quarter-deck. Besides,'Marines ain't like common soldiers. It
makes no diff'rence to them whether.they drill m a stonemason's
yard or in a gale o' wind at sea. Therefore there seemed no
sort of excuse for the shufflin' and jostlin' that went on in'the ranks
as soon as we were on the move. Presently JANNAWAY 'alts us.
"' What the blazes is the matter with you?' he says. 'One
would think you were a pack of infants out of a kindergarten,
instead of long-service infantry o' the line. The left 'alf
comp'ny's disgraceful,' he says, 'and I b'lieve the fourth
section's drunk. The comp'ny will advance—by the left—quick
march!'
"Thenex" minute the left-'and man but two trips, and the
'ole of the fourth section loses the step.
"' Take that man's name, Colour-Sergeant,' says JANNAWAY.
"' Beg pardon, Sir,' says the indignant soldier, ' but my rear-
rank man's done nothin' but tread on my 'eels ever since the
blessed drill began.'
"' Don't talk to me, Sir!' roars JANNAWAY. 'You can check
him as well, Colour-Sergeant, for tellin' me a lie. It's the first
time,' he says sarcaustically, 'that I 've 'card of a rear-rank
man in a blank file!'
"Now, as everyone knows, when there 's an odd number o'
men in a comp'ny, the left-'and file but two is called the blank
file, because there 's a gap at that point in the rear rank. In
other words, the front-rank man has got no one be'ind him.
The comp'ny sniggered, and the man himself looked foolish; so
JANNAWAY, to give him a chance, shifted him to the right o' the
rear rank, and the drill continued.
"Three minutes later the noo front-rank man, with a scared
look on his face, stops out o' the ranks and requests to be made
a pris'ner.
"' What the devil for?' asks JANNAWAY.
"' Because,' says the man, through his chatterin' teeth, ' it
gives me the 'orrors every time I turn about to run agin some-
body I can't see!"
"' I '11 'ave a double sentry posted on the rum cask,' says
JANNAWAY, always suspicious of us pore soldiers. 'The nex'
man as says the blank file 's complete will 'ave a crime made
out against him.'
"He broke up the detachment, reformed and numbered it,
and went on with the drill. But it wasn't a bit o' good. In
spite of Mr. JANNAWAY the blank file teas complete. There was
always Someone marchin' in that vacant place in the left 'alf
comp'ny, and the left 'alf corap'ny didn't like it. After a bit
they began to panic, and the panic spread to the right 'alf, so
that JANNAWAY, with many crool words, was presently forced
to dismiss us.
"The records of the great Sea Regiment," continued Mr.
PAGETT, with apparent irrelevance, "go back, as you well know,
more than two 'undred and thirty years, and they form an
unbroken tale of the most splendid valour in every quarter o'
the globe. Not even a loss of fifty per cent, o' their numbers
'ave stopped the Marines from capturin' a position, and they
'ave gone to the bottom standin' with unbroken ranks upon the
quarterdeck. But even Marines are sometimes seized with
panic, and after that drill we raced back to the minin' tent as
though the devil himself 'ad been at our 'eels. We would 'avo
fought a dozen Dutch flagships with pleasure, but that bloomin'
blank file was a bit too much for our nerves."
So shattered were Mr. PAOETT'S nerves, even after the lapse
of six years, that for several minutes he was entirely uncon-
scious that the tumbler he held midway to his mouth was empty:
nor, on my hastening to atone for my forgetfulness, did he
remember to say "when" until the whiskey had reached the
top of the pretty. His omission to add any water was pos-
sibly but another proof that the great man's thoughts were
ten thousand miles away from his beloved "Coach and Horses."
"I ask you," he resumed, after staring at the fire in silence
for several minutes, "to_consider the sitooation. Three an'
thirty pprejnaropned soldiers—countin' me, an' JANNAWAY, an'
the colour-sergeant—jostlin'each other on a pin's 'ejid of rock
in the most deserted part^o' the Indian Ocean. Night comin'
on, and in our ranks a blank file there was no accountin' for,
and which, by all the rules o' squad drill, didn't'ougbt to 'ave
been there. And now, in the wake o' the blank file, 'ad come
another 'orror called blue funk: and all this, if you please, in
order to make a Dutch adm'ral swear! It made us swear, and
you may lay to it: for it was 'ard, crool 'ard, on the most
deservin' body o' men in Her Majesty's rcg'lar forces."
Mr. PAGETT passed his left hand over his eyes while his right
sought the newly replenished tumbler. After a gallant effort to
control his emotion, he set the glass resolutely upon the table,
and continued.
"At two bells in the first watch Mr. JANNAWAY, who would
'ave carried out routine if he 'd been ROBINSON CKUSOE, ordered
the bugler to sound 'Out lights!' and after we 'd all turned in,
he went the rounds with the colour-sergeant. Everything
being correct, they also retired to their respective tents: and
for some time nothin' broke the oppressive silence but the foot-
steps o' the sentry outside.
"The first thing that 'appened was the rattle of his rifle an'
baynit as he come down to the charge, and his challenge ' 'Alt!
Who goes there?' Now, seein'that every soul on the island
but the sentry himself was in bed, we all sat up on our blankets
to 'ear the reply. But none came: so after a minute or more
the sentry resoomed his walk, and we in the minin' tent lay
down again.
"Before long the thing was repeated, after which it went on
at intervals of about two minutes, but with never a reply to the
challenges. The fifth brought Mr. JANNAWAY to the door of his
tent, and he was in a doose of a rage, you may lay to it.
"' When that militiaman's finished challengin' his own
shadow,' he sings out, 'p'r'aps he'll recollec' that all the in-
'abitants of this pop'lous island are in bed, and want to go to
sleep!'
""Then for the first time in our joint existence,' says the
sentry, his voice shakin' with the tropical cold, 'me and my
shadow 'ave parted comp'ny. It's just gone into the minin'
tent!' he says.
"In less than a brace o' shakes the 'ole thirty of us were
outside the tent in our shirts, which so upset the sentry that
he drops his rifle and starts shinnin' up the jackstaff, greatcoat
an' all.
"'Come down out o' that, you grey ape,' roars JANNAWAY,
1 before I bring you down with my revolver. As for the rest o'
you,' he says, 'if you ain't back in your beds in one minute,
I '11 'ave you all tried for mutiny as soon as we get back to the
ship. To think,' he says, ' that a detachment o' Royal Marines
should be turned into a flock o' silly sheep by a sentry with a
touch o' sunstroke!'
"Then he orders the sentry to be relieved and kep' under
observation in the colour-sergeant's tent as a criminal loonatic:
and we guessed that the colour-sergeant would prefer the com-
p'ny of a criminal loonatic to bein' left by hisself in the dark."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LETTER TO A YOUNG PUBLISHER.
SINCE, my dear JONES, you are good
enough to ask for my advice, need I say
that your success in business -will depend
chiefly upon judicious advertisement?
You are bringing out, I understand, a
thrilling story of domestic life, entitled
Maria's Marriage. Already, I am glad to
learn, you have caused a paragraph to
.appear in the literary journals contra-
dicting "the widespread report that Mr.
KIPITNG and the German EMPEROR have
collaborated in the production of this
novel, the appearance of which is awaited
•with such extraordinary interest." And
you have induced a number of papers to
give prominence to the fact that Mr.
PENWIPER dines daily off curry and clotted
cream. So far, so good. Your next step
will be to send out review-copies, to-
gether with ready-made laudatory criti-
cisms; in order, as you will explain, to
save the hardworked reviewers trouble.
But, you will say, supposing this inge-
nious device to fail? Supposing Maria'*
Marriage to be universally "slatorl'
Well, even then you need not despair.
With a little practice, you will learn the
art of manufacturing an attractive ad-
vertisement column from the most un-
promising material. Let me give you a
brief example of the method:
I.—THE RAW MATERIAL.
"MR. PENWIPER'S latest production
Maria's Marriage, scarcely calls for
serious notice. It seems hard to believe
that even tho most tolerant reader will
contrive to study with attention a work
of -which every page contains glaring
errors of taste. Humour, smartness and
interest are all conspicuously wanting."
—The Thunderer.
"This book is undeniably third-rate—
dull, badly-written, incoherent; in fine,
a dismal failure."—The Wigwam.
"If Maria's Marriage has any real
merit, it is as an object-lesson to aspir-
ing authors. Here, we would say to
them, is a striking example of the way
in which romance should not be written.
Set yourself to produce a work exactly
its opposite iu every particular, and the
chances are that you will produce, if not
a masterpiece, at least, a tale free from
the most glaring faults. For the terrible
warning thus afforded by his volume to
budding writer, Mr. PENWIPEH deserves
to be heartily thanked."—Daily Tele-
phone.
"Maria's Marriage is another book
that -we have received in the course of
the month."—The Parachute.
II.—THE RESULT.

WATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE KNIGHT?
A plaint of Poets Untitled.
[The studied exclusion of the name of Mr.
ALFBED AUSTIN from the list of New Tea:
Knights is supposed to have aroused much indig-
nation in the breast of Mr. SW-NB-BNE, at Putney.
The following lines attempt to give expression to a
sentiment that reflects great credit on the author
of Atalanta in Calydon.]
WHEN the cooling of cosmos began
With a sprinkling of spots on the sun,
At the primal commencement of man,
When tho winds and the waters were one;
Prom the dawn of the dallying years
There came of tlio travail of Time,
Harmony niched from the spheres,
Rhyme find the making of rhyme.
And the nine-fold heavenly brood,
Bred in Olympian air,
Gave us ambrosial food
And to browse on the following fare:—
Mirth that is misery's pillow,
And grief, the bolster of mirth;
Boom of the earth-sick billow,
Ache of the sea-sick earth:
Lips that are drunk with laughter,
Fulness that frets for more,
Wisdom that follows after
Tho wassail that went before;
Beauty that breaks at a breath,
Love that is louder than strife;
Life, the cousin of death,
And death, the ditto of life.
In the subsequent age of gold,
Ere the savour of life went wrong,
When the passions of men took mould
Prom the hand of the Maker of Song;
On the wings of the North and the South
White-hot on the quest they came,
And the truths that dropped from his
Fell on their hearts like flame, [mouth
Ivy was lashed to his locks,
Of pearls was his robe inwrought,
Gaily the fatted ox
Yielded him food for thought.
Sovereign of kings he sat
And sang to the lords of the isles,
By day on a gem-strewn mat,
By night on the star-struck tiles.
He sang of the dregs of desire,
Of sin and the issue of sin,
Of the wealth that his wandering lyre
Had won, and was worthy to win;
Till the feasters were faint in the chest,
And the voice of the waiters was dumb,
And you heard in the course of a rest
Tho crash of a decadent crumb!
England! What of the gold,
Of the fine gold rotting to rust?
What of your heart grown cold
And the eyes of you dimmed with dust?
Where now are the spoils of the bard,
Carbuncles brave on his breast,
Myrrh and emulsion of nard
For the frenzy and fringe of his crest?
What of the deference done
To the builder of bounteous rhymes
In the young year's honours that run
To a column or so of the Times?
Science and service of State,
Trade and the treatment of bile,
ower for the parish-debate,
Nerve for the damming of Nile—
Hence are the sheer heights scaled
By virtue that keeps to the path,
But never a poet has nailed
Even the boon of a Bath!
To the feet that are feathered to follow
The song-god's fluttering shift,
Empty is fame and hollow
Earth that comes with a gift;
But he that fashions his lays
No nearer the Muse's lap
Than the hall where he hangs his bays
When he washes at CARLTON'S tap—
AUSTIN, what of the Knight?
Heavy with hope deferred,
When will he solace our sight,
Panoplied, plumed, and spurred?
Give me no guerdon of mortals!
Zeus-gotten and cherished of Zeus,
I fling their pay to the portals
Hound-bound of the nethermost deuce;
With a hitch to my Bacchanal's wreath,
I mock at the titles of man,
When at Putney aloof on the Heath
I can prance to the pipings of Pan!
O. S.

THE DREAM OF THE STATISTICIAN.
TOTTEHUP had not been feeling well
lately. Perhaps the long series of
magazine articles, written at somewhat
high pressure, was responsible for it.
But he had finished with them for the
present, and as he got into bed that
evening he resolved to have a good rest
from all numerical calculations.
He spent an uncomfortable night, how-
ever. Visions of the little black-and-
white diagrams with which he used to
illustrate his articles danced before his
eyes. The dotted lines and shaded por-
tions pursued him relentlessly, until
nature at last succumbed to the influence
of Morpheus.
He awoke feeling refreshed, and began
to dress leisurely. He was a methodical
man and always arranged his personal
belongings on the dressing-table overnight.
This made it all the more strange that he
could not find his tie-clip that morning
However, he finished his toilet and went
downstairs. Meeting the housemaid on
the way, he asked her if she had seen the
tie-clip anywhere about.
"Oh, please, Sir, a gentleman called for
it last night; but you were so fast asleep,
I fetched it out of your room without
waking you. He said he must have it."
"A gentleman called for my tie-clip!"
"Yes, Sir. He was from the Admiralty,
I think. He said something about it being
required for the defence of the Nation."
TOTTBRUP stared at tho girl for a
moment. Then there came into his mind
the recollection of his earlier articles;
he had touched on the amount of metal
employed each year in the construction of
tie-clips. It had also called attention to
the fact that this same amount of metal
would equip a fleet of war vessels. So
the Government were going to put bis
calculations to the test. Well, this was
fame!
He entered the dining-room. Breakfast
was his favourite meal. His landlady was
one of those few persons who can cook
bacon, and there was a large dish of it on
the table. But TOTTERUP was unusually
hungry that morning, so he rang the bell.
The landlady answered it in person.
"Mrs. MUGGRfDGE," he observed, "I
should like a couple of boiled eggs."
"I 'm very sorry, Sir, but there are no
eggs to be had for love or money just
now."
"Why, this is just the season for them!"
"Well, Sir I can only say what I'm
told. Every egg, new-laid or stale, in the
United Kingdom is wanted for the Straits
of Dover."
Once ngnin, something impelled TOTTER-
UP to recall his statistical works. Yes,
he remembered it clearly now. He
certainly had made the statement that the
number of eggs laid by British hens would
be sufficient, in a certain time, to com-
pletely fill up the Straits of Dover. So
this, too, was being put to the test.
Supposing he had not been quite accurate
in his calculations!
Ho finished his breakfast with toast and
marmalade. Then putting on his hat and
coat he wandered out. He turned into
Oxford Street, and crossed the road. As
he did so, he stumbled over something
in the roadway. Stooping down, ho
picked up a novel. He was glancing
through it when a policeman tapped him
on the shoulder.
"Now then, Sir, please put that back
where you found it."
TOTTERUP looked at the constable, and
then at the ground. To his astonishment,
he noticed that tho whole of tho roadway
was covered with works of fiction, packed
closely together. The volume lie held in
his hand had somehow got dislodged, for
there was a gap at his feet that it fitted
into.
"It's the County Council," remarked
the policeman, in answer to TOTTERUP'S
appealing glance. "Some bloke in the
papers has been pointing out that 'Lon-
don could be paved with novels from Shep-
herd's Bush to Mile End'; so they 're

trying it instead of wood. All this year's
books."
With a wild light in his eyes, TOTTERUP
started walking down the path of fiction
Citywards. He'stopped at his news-
agent's to get a paper.
"None on sale, Sir," said the man.
All being bought up by the Hastro-
nomer-Royal. 'E says as 'ow the daily
papers will reach to the moon in time,
if they pile 'em up; at least, that's what
some writer chap tells 'ira. So 'e's try-
ing to make 'em as helevating as Or.
PARKER even could 'avo wished."
TOTTERUP paused for a moment; then
hailing a hansom, he dashed off to his
fiancee's address. He was shown up into
the drawing-room and found her tying
up a brown-paper parcel, which she pre-
sented to him without a word.
"What is it, dear? " he gasped.
"Only my engagement ring and a few
of your presents to me. Yon know, in
that last article of yours on the different
ages at which people get married, you
point out that the majority of unhappy
marriages take place between females of
from twenty-three to tiee-nty-flae years of
age and males of thirty to thirty-two.
As I am four-and-twenty and you are
just thirty-one, it would be criminal if
we continued to be engaged."
"Rut, my dearest EVANGEUNE!"
"Not a word. Your calculations are
always so correct and clear."
She disappeared through a door at the
end of the room. TOTTERUP dashed after
her, camo in violent contact with the
door handle, and—awoke!
POEMS FOR THE MILLION.
[A serial has been issued consisting entirely of
vene.]
0 MINOR bards, in numbers vast,
Who '' want of space'' so often curse,
Take heart of grace, here is at last
A periodical all verse.
With "copy " editors unkind
(The poet scorners) you pursue;
The whole fair fleld you here will find
One poet's corner, all for you.
Ah! but if all who thus aspire
Must in its pages find a home,
Each monthly issue would require
Encyclopaedias, tome on tome.
Yet, if our minor poets all
Would only each one copy buy,
What other periodical
Could with its circulation vie?
A DAINTY DILEMMA.

Neither manners nor duty
Could save me from being
Absorbed in her beauty.

My eye—gallant rover,
Her beautiful face
Travelled over and over.
Should I tell her—and lose
Her affection for ever?
Gould 1 utter the words
That us two might dissever?
She is raising her eyes !—
Those translucent pools
In whose depths have drowned
Many wise men and fools.
Oh, pity my plight!
To court her disdain,
And never to look
On her beauty again.
For if she should frown—
Ah, pity my plight!
My heaven made hell,
My day turned to night!
Oh, faintly I fought
And fainter. Oh, love,
The syllables softly
To utter I strove.
But I was so powerless,
Tongue-tied and stupid:
If only MARCONI
Had studied with Cup d!
In a burst of despair,
Knowing well all was lost,
I determined to speak;
And I said—at what cost !—
At the risk of destroying
Her wonderful pose,
"There 's such a big smut
On the bridge of your nose!'

CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOE YOUNG EIDERS.
CHAPTER IV.
(Tlie gfii/ fii((J busy meet—Ladies in the lend—the Hunt bivnkfaiit
—y/ie flatter!wj of Fred Dickiiixon.)
AND now you are at tlio meet. Is tlicro a more cheerful ami
inspiriting sight in the world than this gay confusion of high-
mettlcd horses with their gallant riders bright in their scarlet
coats, their white breeches, their polished top-boots and their
shining hats, or more sober but not less workmanlike in
the darker hues of mufti? Here, too, are the ladies, noble
figures of horsewomen, sure but easy of seat, light-handed and
glowing with health. Yon are a youngster, and, like other
youngsters, you probably think women a feeble folk doomed to
be guided and controlled and
kept in subjection by such
stalwart, brave, and sagacious
creatures as yourself. But wait
a bit till the old fox has
broken covert, and the hounds,
responsive to the huntsman's
"Yoick!" are settled on his
track. They run fast, and the
country is not of the easiest.
There are banks and ditches
that call for all a rider's skill
and courage; a little further
on is a brook, not too narrow,
and with a hard rake-off: then
we dash through a covert, ears
open for the faltering music of
the hounds, now checking for
a moment, now pelting along
the rides with right arm ready
to ward off the low hanging
branches; then out again into
the opeiv—a grass country with
a stiff line of posts and rails.
Some have been pounded at a
bank, some have come to ruin
at the brook ; others have gone
astray in the wood, or have
displayed an excessive cunning
in skirting it in the wrong
direction; now one or two re-
fuse at the first post and rails.
Crash goes ADOI.PHUS WIXTKII-
SIDE; his horse is blown, and
has misjudged his jump. His
horse pecks on landing, pulls
himself together pecks again
and rolls over, and, lo, the onco. immaculate ADOLPHUS be-1
comes a muddy chaos, his hat batte-red into tho likeness
of an ancient concertina, and all the 'pride gone out of him.
But far ahead, ever in the first flight with the boldest riders,
behold Miss MIRABEL, that airy, dainty young woman over
whom ADOLPHUS was prepared to extend his protection and
patronage. She is well mounted: every hunting girl must
have a good horse, but a good horse is not enough. Nerve and
skill and firmness and judgment are wanted, and all those she
has. Nothing daunts her; she takes her own line, and asks no j
man to lead her. She never stops a crowd by bungling with a |
gate, or attempts absurd feats of jumping when there is a j
quicker, a safer, and an easier way. She is bold; but she!
spares her horse over the heavy land, and lets him feel his J
speed—but not too much—over the springy turf, and when,
with a llnal rush and a fierce concentration, the hounds run
into their quarry, I warrant she will not be far away. When
you come panting and pounding up a few minutes later, you i
will have learnt that, with all her soft and pretty ways and

"FOG SI
(A Hint to the
her delicate complexion, Miss MIRABEL has 'nothing to learn
from your own strong sex in the matter of riding to hounds.
But see whither the ardour of the chase has carried me. We
have hardly arrived at the meet, and already have I carried
you at breakneck speed from a find to a check, from a check to
a view, from a view to a death in the morning. Let us hark
back ;i bit, and take things more easily.
You are to suppose, then, that we are at an invitation meet,
and that breakfast has been laid out in the spacious hall of
Elvaston Manor, tho home of Squire WILDRAHAM, one of the
mainstays of our hunt. A few of the older fellows have gone in
and made a pretence of toying with ham, or galantine, or cold
pheasant to the accompaniment of a glass of champagne or a
tankard of ale, or a go of cherry brandy. Outside, the rest of
the riders have had their glass,
the hunt servants guarding the
wise and friendly hounds in the
adjoining paddock have had
their drain of beer, the Squire
and the farmers on their
honest serviceable nags have
exchanged hearty greetings—
everybody is in the highest
spirits, and tongues are wag-
ging freely. I advise you not
to say too much, and not to
be critical. Rather admire
where you can honestly do so;
if not, keep silent. But it is
so easy to admire and to
gratify. Try the plan on FRED
DICKINSON, as thus—
"By Jupiter, FRED, that's a
good-looking horse you're on;
Where did you get him?"
"Bought him from a chap in
Ireland. Only got him over
last week."
"I bet you had to pay a stiff
price."
"Not a bit. Eighty, includ-
ing all expenses of getting him
here."
"Well, you have got a bar-
gain. I never saw a better cut
of horse for pace and jumping.
His quarters are magnWcent."
In this simple interchange of
sentences you have flattered
KKKli's judgment of a horse and
his skill as a bargainer, and
in the most delicate way you've made him a warm friend.
Later on, you'11 overhear him saying to the Squire, "Poosid
pleasant young chap, that LUJHTTOOT; rides as straight as a line,
and knows a thing or two about a horse." So easily arc the
great conciliated.

DUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT is a high tribute to the anonymous writer of An Englinh-
tcoman's Love-Letters (JOHN MURRAY) that its readers are
forthwith resolved into rival camps, one averring that the
letters are genuine, the other recognising in them the hand of
a practised writer. My Baronite dwells with the latter com-
munity. Xot the least clever part of a rarely clever book is
what is called "Explanation." Study of style discloses the
fact that it is written by the same hand that penned the letters.
The only argument in favour of tho theory of actuality, is that
the person to whom the correspondence purports to be addressed
is the very kind of fellow who would be disposed to turn an
honest penny by selling the originals to an enterprising
publisher. There is not,.through the nearly ninety letters, a
single sentence devoted to description either of the man or his
mother. But with subtle art the writer manages to convey a
clear idea of these shadowy players in her plot. We know the
mother, narrow-minded, hard-hearted, wilful, arbitrary, selfish
in her attachment to her son. And him, a weak, vacillating
creature, who, rather than suffer household rows, breaks the
heart of a loving woman. It is a new way of accomplishing the
old work of novel-writing, not to be recommended to the
commonality since it requires rare gifts amounting to genius.
Xothing so pitiful, so pathetic, for pure literary style so
attractive, has been written for a long time.

In the leisure of a recess and the labour of a \Vinter Session,
Mr. IAN MALCOLM has compiled a Calendar of Empire (BLACK-
WOOD). His idea is to enter under proper dates certain historical
events in the way of births and deaths, great legislative acts,
and decisive battles by land and sea. For each he draws from
extensive reading a more or less appropriate quotation. It is,
perhaps, difficult to understand how one who can appreciate
BURKE, CANNING, CLARENDON, TENNYSON, MEREDITH, and other
masters, displays decided weakness for the noisy vapouring of
W. E. HENLRY, redolent of the martial ecstasy of the music-
hall before the bill for drinks round comes in. In one of several
quotations from that quarter is found the quaint couplet:
Through his diurnal round of dawns.
Our drum-tap squires the sun.
My Baronito prefers the older version of the same- boast
about "the Empire on which tho sun never sets." However,
certain pages can be skipped, and there remain many of
pleasant reading.
:his backwater of the Transvaal War, to read how, more than
thirty years ago, CARYLE said, "The English people are an
"ncredible people. They seem to think it is not necessary that
a General should have the least knowledge of the art of war."
What does General X. or M. (as the case may be), of South
African campaigning, say to that?

MARK !RUTHERFORD, going over his desk, has collected a
series of stray papers, which FISHER UNWIN publishes under
the title Pages from a Journal. They widely vary in topic,
from CARLYLE to JUDAS ISCARIOT, from SPINOZA to Sir WALTER
SCOTT, with some notes on MILTON, and reflections on the
morality of BYRON'S poetry. Finally, M. R. throws in half-a-
dozen short stories, the whole making an attractive book. My
Baronite finds tho introductory article describing a visit to
CARLYLE in 1818, not tho least interesting. It is striking, in

Mr. FITCHETT had a happy thought when it occurred to him
to rescue from imdeserved oblivion a cluster of soldierly
autobiographies, to give some pictures of famous battles, Hot
as described by the historian or analysed by the philosopher,
but as seen by the eyes of men who fought in them. The plan
of campaign was, my Baronite remembers, in operation when.
KINGLAKE wrote his history of the Crimea. Phases of all tho
great battles are therein described, often in the very words of
privates and officers who took part in them. In Wellington's
Men (SMITH, ELDER) Mr. FITCHETT roams through famous
battle-fields, from Torres Vedras to Waterloo, and, culling from
a multitude of books, presents moving pictures drawn by hands
that laid down gun or pike to take up the pen.
THE BARON DE B.-W.

[Attention has been called to the fact that the ruins of the ancient Ionian
City of Magnesia on the Moeander, which were laid open by the German
Professors K MM. HUMANS and Baron KILLER about a decade ugo, have since
been partially demolished by the head architect of the Turkish Province of
.Smyrna, a Polish engineer named BABOXOVSKI. In 1895 he had the temple
of Zeus pulled down, and used the large marble stones for the construction of
a mosque at Smyrna and of a bridge over the Micaudcr.—The Standard.]
WHERE were thy thunders, Zeus, when this dull fool,
Xot reverencing thine old, time-ruined halls,
Pillaged the city thou wast wont to rule
And tore the marble from thy temple walls?
All silent! Not one peal broke from the cloud
To fright this impious robber from thy shrine
Thy glory is departed, thy head bowed,
And the Turk rules the lands that once were thine,
Therefore we should have let thy temple lie
Buried beneath the dust, unknown, unseen,
Far down, where no Barbarian Pasha's eye
Could mark the spot nor know where thou hadst been.
But we revealed thy secret and thy stones
Cry out against us from Meander's flood,
While round the bridge they build the sad stream moniis
To see thee fallen, knowing thoe a god.
Thy stream is slow, Mteander, thy heart cold,
Or thou wouldst rise in mountainous spate and sweep
Bridge, Pasha, in one common ruin rolled,
Before thy wrath and drown them in the deep!
Strange that great Zeus himself could not prevail
Xor all the gods of this Ionian land,
To save their old Hellenic citadel,
And stay this Polish dog's destroying hand!
Could they not? Then, indeed, the gods are dead I
But Europe lives. Let it be Europe's work
To hold above their shrines her segis dread,
And save the gods of Hellas from the Turk!

DRAMATIC SEQUELS.
II.
EVERYBODY who has seen SHERIDAN'S
play The Critic must have been filled
with curiosity to read the Press notices
on Mr. PUFF'S tragedy The Spanish
Armada. The following sequel to SlIKRI-
DAN'S comedy embodies some of these.
As the play is called The Critic, the
sequel may fitly be called—
THE OTHER CRITIC?.
SCENE.—BANGLE'S house. Mr. and Mrs.
DANGLE, SNEER and Sir FRETFUL
PLAGIARY discovered discussing the
first performance of Pt'FF's play, which
ha* taken place a uvefc previously. A
table is littered with Press cuttings
dealing with the event, supplied by the
indispensable Romeilee.
Sir Fretful Plagiary. I give you ray
word, the duel scene was taken wholly
from my comedy The Lovers Abandoned
—pilfered, egad!
Dangle. Bless my soul! You don't say
so?
Sir F. And TILBURINA'S speech about
the "finches of the grove." 'Twas I
first thought of finches, in my tragedy of
Antoninus.'
Dangle. But I can't believe my friend
PUFF can have borrowed deliberately
from you, Sir FRETFUL.
Sneer. No ona could possibly believe
thatl
Sir F. Eh?
Mrs. Dangle. It must have been a coin-
cidence.
.Sir F. Coincidence! Egad, Madam,
'twas sheer theft. And that use of the
white handkerchief! Stolen bodily, on
my conscience. Coincidence!
Dangle (judicially). It may be so—though
he t« my friend.
Sir F. May te so! It is so I Zounds,
DANQLE, I take it very unfriendly of you
to have any doubt at all about the matter!
Dangle (liedging). The reaemblances are
certainly very marked—though he in my
friend. But will you hear what the critics
say about it?
[Turning nervously to pile of Press
cuttings.
Sir F. Do they say anything about his
indebtedness to me?
Sneer. Not a word, I dare bo sworn.
Sir F. Then I don't want to hear them.
None of the rogues know their business.
Dangle. But they 're very severe on the
play.
Sir F. Are they? There's something in
the fellows, after all. Pray read us some
of i la- notices.
Dangle. Shall I begin with The Times?
'Tis very satirical, and ns full of quota-
tions as a pudding is of plums.
Sneer. I know the ;style—a vocabulary
recruited from all the dead and living
languages. 'Tis the very Babel of
dramatic criticism. Begin, DASGLS.
Dangle (reading). "The philosopher who
found in thought the proof of existence,
crystallised his theory in the phrase' Cogito
ergo sum,' 'I think, therefore, I exist.'
In this he found the explanation of what
HUGO called the ne"ant g<?ant. The theory
of the author of The Spanish Armada, on
the contrary, seems to be ' Sum, ei-go non
cogitabo,' 'I exist, therefore I need not
think1"
Sir F. Ha! Ha! Very good, i' faith.
Dangle (continuing). "Lutciate ogni
speranea — the audience murmurs with
DANTE, as three mortal hours pass and Mr.
PUFF is still prosing. Nor has he any
dramatic novelty to offer us. The scene a
faire is on conventional lines. The boards
are hoar with the neiges d' antan. There
is the anagnorisis desiderated by ARIS-
TOTLE, and the unhappy ending required
by the Elizabethans. The inevitable
peripeteia"
Mr*. D. You know, Mr. DANGLE, I don't
understand a single word you 're reading.
Sneer. Nor I, upon my soul.
.Sir F. It is certainly somewhat obscure.
Dangle. Shall I omit a few sentences, and
go on again where the allusions are less
plentiful? (Reads lialf aloud to himself,
knitting his brows in the effort to under-
stand what it is all about.) No trace of
HEINE'S Weltschmerz .... capo e espada
. . NlETSCHZE'8 Uebermensch .... tic
cornm pueros .... PETRARCH'S immortal
Jo t' onto . . . . le canif du jardinier et
ccliti de mon pere •"
Mrs. Dangle. Really, Mr. DANQLK, if you
can find nothing more intelligible to read
than that farrago of jargon, 1 shall go
away. Pray read us something in English,
for a change.
Dangle (much relieved, selecting another
cutting). Here 's the Daily Telegraph—a
whole column.
Sneer. Not much English there, I '11
warrant.
Dangle (reading.) "Time was when the
London playhouses had not been invaded
by the coarse suggestiveness or the veiled
indelicacy of the Norwegian stage, when
Pater-Jamilia* could still take his daughters
to the theatre without a blush. Those
days are past. The Master—as his fol-
lowers call him—like a deadly upas tree,
has spread his blighting influence over
our stage. Morality, shocked at the fare
that is nightly set before her, shuns the
playhouse and vice usurps the scene once
occupied by the manly and the true"
Sneer (who has been beating time). Hear!
hear!
Dangle. "In the good old days, when
MACREADY"
Sir F. Zounds, Mr. DANGLE, don't you
think we might leave MACREADY out of
the question? I notice that when the
Daily Telegraph mentions MACREADY the
reference never occupies less than a
quarter of a column. You might omit that
part, and take up the thread further on.
Dangle. Very well. (Continuing) "It
is impossible not to be astonished that a
writer of Mr. PUFF'S talents should break
away from the noble traditions of SHAK-
SPEARE to follow in the footsteps of the
Scandinavian ''
Mrs. Dangle. Surely, Mr. DANGLE,
we've had that before.
Dangle (testily). No; not in the same
words.
Mrs. Dangle. But the sense
Dangle. Egnd, why will you interrupt!
You can't expect a writer for the ponny
press to have something new to say in
every sentence! How the plague is a
dramatic critic who has nothing to say
to fill a column, if he is never to be
allowed to repeat himself?
Sneer. How, indeed!
Sir F. Ah, I remember when my play
The Indulgent Husband was produced ''
Sneer (yawning). I think, DANGLE, you
might leave the Telegraph and try one of
the weekly papers. What does The World
say?
Dangle. As you will (selecting a new
cutting). "In his new play The Spanish
Armada Mr. PUFF has set himself to deal
with one of those problems of feminine
psychology with-which IBSEN, HAUPTMANN,
and SUDERMANN, and all the newer school
of continental dramatists have made us
familiar. The problem is briefly this.
When filial duty beckons a woman one
way and passion another, which call should
she obey? Should she set herself to "live
her life" in the modern phrase, to realise
her individuality and stand forth glad and
free as GREGERS WERLE says? Or should
she deny her ego, bow to the old conven-
tions, accept the old Shibboleths and sur-
render her love? Like .Vora, like Hcdda,
Tilburina is a personality at war with its
environment"
Sir F. (interrupting). Pray, Mr. DANGLE,
did you not tell me the critics were all
unfavourable to Mr. PUFF'S play?
Dangle. Nearly all of them. But if the
other critics abuse a play, you will always
find the critic of The IVorM will praise it.
'Tis the nature of the man.
Sir F. But how does ho know what the
other fellows will say?
Dangle. Easily. You see, he writes only
for a weekly paper and always reads what
the others have said first. Then he takes
the opposite view.
Sneer. No wonder he's so often right!
Dangle (continuing). "In WHWKERANDOS
we have the man of primary emotions
only: Like SOLNES, he climbs no steeples,
like LOVBORG, he may now and then be
seen with the vine leaves in his hair . . . ."
Mrs. Dangle. Stop, stop, Mr.. DANGLE.
Surely there must be some mistake. I
don't remember that WHISKERANDOS had
anything in his hair. He wore a helmet
all the time!

A SOVEREIGN a soldier had.
She sent him o'er the sea;
He wasn't what you call a lad,
But handy as could be.
He knew when right to strike a light,
And when to square the jobs;
He 's done his best with zeal and zest,
Hurrah ! for Little BOBS!
C/ioriis.
He 's an Earl, also K.G.,
Little BOBS! Little Boas!
Commander-in-chief of all is he,
Little BOBS! Little BOBS!
May he a centenarian be,
Little BOBS! Little BOBS!
And so again we '11 shout amain,
Hurrah for Little BOBS!
THE TYPEWRITER AS A HUMOURIST.
HITHERTO, the typewriter has not been
regarded as a thing sentient with humour;
that is where we have unwittingly done it
an injustice. It is more than a humourist;
it is a wild wag, upon occasions. Whilst
writing these words, I am gazing sadly
upon the wreckage of a story which has
just been returned after undergoing the
process of typing. Some of the extracts
given below, suggest distinctly original
views on life.
"The English reader, generally speak-
ing, knows little of Russian geography,"
1 wrote; and then the merry typewriter
came in, with—
"The English reader, generally speak-
ing, knows little of roomy photography."
This was a trifle disconcerting to the
conscientious author to start with, but
worse was to come.
"I sprang forward and pulled the
nearest Cossack from his saddle" eventu-
ated in—
"I sprang forward and pulled the
dearest Cosaque from his muddle."
If this sort of thing had not been cor-
rected, I felt that it might have caused
my story to lose, somewhat, in intensity.
I went on, however, with perseverance.
"Crimes such as these cannot be swept
aside without a blush."
This was rendered—
"Crumbs such as these cannot be swept
outside without a brush."
I sighed, corrected, and continued—
"The great soul beaming in his face,"
which the demon instrument made into—
"The great fool bending in his face."
At this juncture, I began to be really
discouraged. But the next few lines ran
on without any mistake, and I took heart
again. After nearly a whole page cor-
rectly transcribed, I stopped short at—
"He walked with giant strides through
fern and bracken."
Which came out—
'He walked with gummy slides through
'ern and bracken."
My lips began to frame a—a—a—hasty
xpression, but I resolutely choked it
down again, and resumed reading, with
nothing stronger than another sigh. All
went well until the finish of the chapter.
"The Count turned sorrowfully away:
and as he once more faced the grim old
aouse, his eyes fell upon the Duchesse
D ' ODDES—alone.''
But the typewriter, that all-conquering,
iuow-better-than-you-do-yourself instru-
ment was not to be cheated of its little
joke: and my lines were made to read
thus—
'The Count turned sorrowfully away;
and as he once more faced the grin old
tiorse, his eyes fell upon the Dutchie of
TOD SLOAN."
Then I took off my boots and threw
them through the window; hurled the
coal-scuttle downstairs, and broke the
mirror with the fire-irons. I felt better
after this; but in future, I think I shall
find it less wearing to refrain from re-
quisitioning the typewriter; its peculiar
style of humour is too boisterous for my
appreciation.
AN ERROR IN EYES.
I SAT me down to write a song
About your eyes, >
A lyric dainty, not too long,
Of quaint surprise,
To find that orbs so clear and true
Should realise the sapphire blue
And thrill my heart-chords through and
through
With tender sighs.
I sit me down to read your note
Of pretty purls;
I picture you just as you wrote
With shaking curls-

MARS THROUGH THE GLASSES.
(Communicated—unsteadily.)
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—This is a most re-
markable experience. You know what a
tasting order is. Well, I had one, and
tasted port, sherry, port and sherry. Not
much, you know—merely tasting. You
know what I mean.
Well, they say that, although you don't
take anything to talk of—say, a glass
hero and a glass there—you get intoxi
cated through the atmosphere of the
place. Absurd notion, because—I write
because—if you eat a biscuit you can't be-
come intoxicated. Too absurd for words
Look at me, now. You know what ]
mean.
I have been tasting at the Docks. Now
'. am trying to get a message from Mars.
should say have been. Messages from
Hars can't be sent. Can't be sent, you
mderstand. You know what I mean.
Well, I was looking at Mars. Through
a big telescope, and that sort of thing.
You know what I mean. And I stopped
ust for a moment or so to take a glass of
soda and brandy. You know what I mean.
Well, I looked at Mars, and I give you
my word of honour—you know what I
mean—my word of honour, there were four
)lanets! A quartette of Mars! And all
wobbling! All of them! You know what
mean.
Well, I thought I could make out a
signal. I saw plainly up in the sky, first,
'Yon have had a tasting order for the
3ocks." I sang out, "That's right, I
lave, and I am as sober as a judge." Then
tfars telegraphed, '• No; you are as in-
:oxicated as a fly."
From this I know it's all rot, you under-
stand. Mars wouldn't have sent such a
message. So I take the whole thing to be
a myth.
You know what I mean.
Can't write any more. Going to bed.
ONR GLASS MORE.
P.S.—Can't take off my boots. You
know what I mean.
TO MY DOG.
You 'RE a funny looking fellow
With your coat of dingy yellow,
Just the colour of a January fog;
And 1 think you 've got a feature
Out of almost every creature
That could fairly claim to reckon as a
dog.
I have often sat and pondered
On your ancestors, and wondered
What a curio a list of them would be:
It would surely tax the knowledge
Of the Royal Heralds' College
To approximately trace your pedigree.
You can boast a collie's muzzle,
But I think your legs would puzzle
All the Kennel Club; and though one
might suppose
That your ears suggest a spaniel,
It would take a second DANIKL
To decide upon the merits of your toes.
There's a dash of bull and setter—
But I really think it better
That we specify no further, my dear Sir,
It will simplify confusion i
If we come to the conclusion;
You 're a cross between a mongrel and a
cur.

OH, GALUPPI BALDASARO, am I to believe my ears?
Are they really speaking truly, these confounded gondoliers?

From their alabaster coffins, from tho Islands of the Blest,
Break the sleep in which Death laps them and indignantly

one out of it, viz. BULWER LYTTON'S Pauline, or The. Lady of

[JANUARY 16, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE
BY MAJOR W. P. DRURY.
"DURIN' the next hour nothin' seemed to be stirrin' under
the Southern Cross. The noo sentry cither didn't see anything
to challenge, or didn't want to, and some o' the men had even
begun to snore. I was just droppin' off to sleep myself, when
a snorer at the other end o' the tent suddenly raps out an oath,
and his boot comes whizzin' down the gangway.
"' The next swab as plays me that trick,' he grumbles, 'will
'ave to take off his toonik to me in the rnornin'.' ,
"' What trick, chum?' I asks, chuckin' him back his boot.
"' Puttin' Ilia icy cold foot on my face,' he says, indignant.
"It didn't sound nice, somo'ow, and my 'eart commenced to
beat a devil's tattoo under the blankets. But nobody said
nothin', and if it 'adn't been for the thumpin' of a dozen gallant
"carts besides mine, you might 'ave 'card n pin drop.
"Presently, 'owever, the drummer, who slop' next to the
corpril, calls out soinethin' beneath his bedclothes.
"' What is ' STICKS ' a-sayin' ?' asks one o' the men anxiously.
"' He 's only talkin' in his sleep,' says the corpril.
"'No, he ain't,' pipes the boy in his 'igh treble, 'but gome-
body's a-ioo?fci7i' ire his!'
"This statement was received with a most oncomfortable
silence of several minutes. Then the man next to me begins
'urriedly to scramble into his trousers.
"' The kid "s quite right,' he says, 'and 1 know bloomin' well
who the sleep-walker is.'
"' Who?' inquires a dozen voices at once.
"'The Blank Pile,' says the man, 'and he's lookin' for a
sleepin" billet, that's what he's a-doin' of. But he ain't goin'
to doss next to me,' he says, and with that he bolts out o' the
tent.
"In another minute there was nobody — so far as we knew —
left inside it. We all wanted to keep the sentry comp'ny till
daylight." •
Mr. PAGETT paused to refill his pipe, an operation he effected
with characteristic absent-minded ness from my pouch. I feigned
to be pondering his last words.
"After such a night of horror," I hazarded, " the daylight
must indeed have been a welcome relief."
He slipped the pouch, with charming ntuoete, into his pocket.
"You mark time a bit," he said: "I 'aven't finished with that
night of 'orror yet."
I murmured an apology.
"No," he continued. "Before the sun rose we were destined
to 'ave another scare, compared with which the others were
child's-play. It was this way, look.
"The corpril was explainin' to Mr. JANNAWAY, who "ad come
out of his quarters in his pyjammers, that the men couldn't
sleep in the minin' tent on account of the heat, and JANNAWAY
was just beginnin' to talk sarcaustic about a girls' school afraid
o' the dark, when the sentry drops his rifle with a clatter that
brings all our gallant "earts into our necks. His teeth were
rattlin' in his 'ead like a boxful o' dice, you could 'ave 'ung up
your coat and 'at on his eyes, and he was pointin' to his front
like a sign-post shook by the wind. At first we thought it was
an appleplctic fit, but after a bit wo discovered that he was
wishful for us to look at the jackstaff.
"The first glimmer o' dawn was whitcnin' the eastern 'orizon,
and there was just light enough for us to sec an oxtr'ordin'ry
phenomenon that made even a detachment o' Marines stare.
There wasn't air enough to chill your wetted linger: it was a
dead tropical calm: the great jack and its 'all turds lay along-
side the staff as if they were glued to it. Yet all of a .sudden
the long fold of bunting stirred, and the double lines twanged
against the pole like a plucked 'arpstring!
"Five seconds later the thing 'appened again, and then
continued at perfectly reg'lar intervals. Not a soul, as far as
we could see, was within ten yards of that bewitched spar.
Yet one thing was quite plain. Someone was flngerin' the
'alliards before our very eyes!
"Presently JANXAWAY clears his throat.
"'Am I goiu' stark starin' mad like the rest o' you,' he
asks 'uskily, ' or is there a bell ringin' somewhere?'
"You might 'ave stabbed the silence which followed with a
baynit.
"' There is a bell, Sir,' says one o' the men at length, 'a big
bell a-tolling. I should judge it to be as far away as Batavia,
or p'r'aps Plymouth,' he says; 'but in either case you may lay
to it that it's no earthly bell ——'
"'That's enough,' says JANNAWAY, stampin' his foot. 'I
won't 'ave no more of it. Colour-Sergeant,' he-says, 'as soon
as it's daylight fall the men in for bathin' parade. There 'K
nothin' like a sea dip to steady the nerves." And with that ho
walks off into the middle o' the island.
"The detachment strolled down to the water 's edge, while I,
disbelievin' in ghosts now that the daylight was comin', sat
down and lit my pipe. At first I watched the sunrise, and it
seemed to me that the day was gettin' up with a most disreput-
able black eye. Across the red, an' green, an' orange inflam-
mation of the dawn was stuck a dark patch that in the case of a
pore soldier would 'ave got him confined to barricks for a
fortnight. But after a bit my attention was attracted to
Lootenant JANNAWAY, who was peerin' under a great ledge o'
rock a couple of 'undred yards away. Presently he stood up,
and beckoned to me.
"' Tell me what you see in there,' he says, when I reached
him.
"' You ought to know,' I says, moppin' my face, after I 'd
looked into the 'ole; 'you 've been starin' at it for the last five
minutes.'
"' But I want to make sure, you insolent vagabone,' he says.
'Our nerves are all endways, and p'r'aps I 've been mistook.'
"' Very well, then,' says I, 'it's a rusted round shot mixed
up with a 'uman skeleton.'
"' I thought so,' ho returns, with a sigh of relief. 'But since
this island is a noo-born baby, in a manner o' speakiu', it licks
me 'ow them things come there.'
"'P'r'aps,' says I, after thinkin" 'ard for some moments,
'they were born with the bloomin' baby.'
"' You 're a fool, PAGETT,' says he, 'and you 'd better go an'
fall in with the rest.'
"Now, as I was carryin' my wounded feelin's back to my
comrades, it suddenly struck me that the dawn wasn't breakiu'
as quickly as it usually does in those latitoods. The black
patch over the day's eye had covered the entire face of the
eastern sky, and was spreadin' to the zenith faster than the
daylight itself. It was plain, from the incessant twinklin', that
a tropical thunderstorm was comin' up with the sun, and you
may take my word for it that a bare rock in mid-ocean ain't the
safest place to see one from.
"The detachment 'ad already undressed, and were bein'
mustered by the colour-sergeant, so I slipped off my clothes and
joined them.
"Before the muster was over, the mornin' 'ad grown much
darker than the night had ever been, and the sky above us
•WHS like a great velvet pall with its borders trailin' in the
sea. Long zigzag rents were torn in the pall about once every
second, nor was there any interval in the 'orriblc din o' the
thunder. Luckily wo escaped the rainfall, but we could 'ear
it liiHsin' on the sea a mile away, like forty thousand locomo-
tives bio win' off steam.
"As it was too dark to bathe, and too dangerous to go into
the tent where the arms were, JANNAWAY fell us in two deep
in rear of it. Before very long, 'owever, the eastern edge o'
the pall began to lift, and a streak of crimson sky appeared
beneath it. Then the streak widened; orange showed abovo

the red, primrose above the orange, till presently •we could
see the bright blue o' the zenith. The velvet pall had rolled
away as quickly as it 'ad spread."
Mr. PAGETT removed the pipe from his mouth, and laid it
upon the table.
"You've been in the tropics yourself, Sir?" he observed,
looking into the fire.
I nodded.
"Did you ever see one o' them lightnin' photographs?"
"I've heard of them," I admitted cautiously. "It is said
that they cannot yet be accounted for by science, though they
are undoubtedly electrical."
"I saw one that mornin' on the island," he mused; "the
flash over the Tor just now 'minded me of it.
"The first thing we noticed after JANNAWAY dismissed us>
and wo 'd moved away from the tent, was the double line of
our shadows still fixed upon the curtain, where it "ad been
thrown by the lightnin'."
"Yes," I admitted, "that was quite possible."
"Quite possible. But 'ow about this? The drummer, who
was starin' at the phenomenon from the front o' the group,
suddenly turns round.
"' I thought,' he squeaked, 'that, countin' Mr. JAXXAWAY,
we were thirty-three all told."
"' Then, for once in your sinful young life,' says the eorpril
'you thought right, my son.'
"'Well,' says the boy, edgin' into the middle o' the crowd,
''ow do you account for there bein' thirty-/onr shadows on the
bloomiu' tent?'
"Nobody attempted to account for it; nobody even wanted
to account for it. What everybody did want, 'owever, was to
get off that cursed island without another minute's delay.
Like one man the detachment turned and bolted for the pin-
nace in which we 'ad landed, and which was moored a few
yards from the beach. It was the stampede of the previous
afternoon over again, with the diff'rence that this time me.
an' the colour-sergeant, an' JANNAWAY were in it as well.
"We splashed through the water, shinned over the gunnel o
the big boat, got out the oars, and gave way like a crew
possessed. But we 'd barely put a hundred yards between u;
and the Blank File's shadow on the tent, before the sea began
to bubble about the pinnace like water round an egg in a
saucepan.
"'For the Lord's sake,' cries one o' the men, layin' on his
oar, 'look at the bloomin' island!'
"Then we saw a most curious thing. The island wa
gradually grow-in' smaller—in other words, it was sinkin' before
our eyes! Presently only the tops o' the tents and the jackstal
were visible above the water, and then only the Union Jacl
itself. When that 'omely bit o' buntin' 'ad gone too, the
drummer burst out a-cryin'.
"'Any'ow,' says the Corpril cheerily, 'that exarsperatin
Blank File's gone with it.'
"'Aye,'chimes in the'Dismal JIMMY 'of the detachment, 'bu
we shall be under stoppages o' pay until them arms an
accoutrements are made good. 1 said at the time,' he continued
'that it was no earthly bell a-tollin''
"'Take that man's name for disobedience of orders,' roar
out JAXXAWAY. ''Ow dare you make my flesh creep,' he says
'when I 'aven't got a stitch o' clothin' on?'
"' There's the Dutch flagship in the offing just off the por
benm, Sir,' sings out another.
"'Then I 'ope to goodness,' says JAXNAWAY, casting a
anxious eye over the naked forms before him, ' that the adm'ra
'nsn't brought no ladies with him to see the noo island!'
"An hour later we clambered one by one up the steep sid
o' the Dutchman, and were served out with a pair o' bagg
trousers apiece. If there were any ladies on board they mus
'uve been sent below before we got alongside, and the orf'cers
and men didn't matter. Mr. JANNAWAY told the adm'ral tha
e were pore castaways from a wrecked emigrant ship, and the
dm'ral, with one eye cocked on me, said he 'd had the pleasure
'meetin' one at least of the pore emigrants before. Then,
ith a chronic twinkle in the same eye, he carried us back to
atavia, and put us on board our own ship.
"Before reportin' ourselves, 'owever, Mr. JAXXAWAY ad-
ressed us in a few kind words.
"' If yon mention that there Blank File,' he says, 'you will
et the credit of bein' bigger liars than what you really are.
herefore,' he says, 'I shouldn't.'
"And you may lay to it that we didn't!"
From a battered Service ditty-box on the mantelpiece Mr.
AOETT produced a crumpled half-sheet of notepaper.
"That inscription," said he, "was sent me by Lootenant
ANXAWAY a year after we paid off. He copied it off an old brass
n the tower of a church at Sandwieh."
I refrained from commenting on the remarkable resemblance
f the writing to Mr. PAGETT'S own cramped caligraphy, and
ead it aloud.
"Sacred to the Memory," it ran, "of BELTISHAZZAR FARWIO,
rivate in the Marines, and sometime a Bellringer of this
Church. Who died on the 29th Dec. 1770, on board His Majesty's^
hip Endeavour (commanded by the famous Navigator, Captain
AMES COOK), and was buried at sea in Lat. 9° 13' 8. and Long.
04° E."
"Wasn't it a most extr'ordin'ry thing," asked Mr. PAGETT,
egarding me out of the tail of his eye, "that the pore feller
.hould 'ave come to the surface again on the middle of a
•olcanic island?"
"Most extraordinary !" I murmured.
"And that, after all them years, he should 'ave drilled once
more with his old regiment and been photographed with them
by lightnin '?"
"I never heard anything like it before," said I.
"And that he should 'ave tolled that onearthly bell to warn
ihem that the island was goin' to sink?"
"Wonderful indeed! Yet to me, Mr. PAGETT, the most
wonderful thing of all is your own marvellous power of
nven—of memory, I mean."
Mr. PAGETT stared at me in pained surprise. "I was afraid,"
le said reproachfully, "that you were goin' to use another
word. In which case, Mister, me an' you would 'ave 'ad to
part brassrags!"
ILL-TREATING.
To Mr. Punch.
SIR,—It makes my blood boil to read how the precious time
of the Commander-in-Chief is wasted by precious fools. Not
long ago an admirable appeal against " Treating" was written
by Lord ROBERTS. Please observe that I call him by his correct,
name, or, without the title, simply ROBERTS, for the everlasting
use of " BOBS " disgusts me, and seems to me wanting alike in
sense and courtesy. We do not call KITCHENER " Kitty," and
a hundred years ago they did not call NELSOX "Nelly." Lord
ROBERTS, as I have said, protested against "treating" the
private in the "public." Allow me to protest against the public
ill-treating Lord ROBERTS in private. He cannot even travel by
railway, on his own private business, without being button-
holed and talked at by mayors or vestrymen whenever the train
stops. Every obscure borough, from Mudby-in-the-Marsh to
Shrimpington-on-Sea, pesters him to receive its ridiculous and
useless "freedom." Freedom, indeed! I'd give "em some
freedom of speech on my part which might show the meddle-
some mayors and the addle-headed aldermen what I thought of
'em. But Lord ROBERTS is too good-natured to do that. Allow
me, therefore, to protest against his being ill-treated in this
manner. Yours indignantly,
HANG DASH BLOW (Major, retired).

Where the unblushing Sappho wrote
The hymns we hardly like to quote ;—

Who found your fame had been and gone;
There seems to be a future yet
For Tenedos and Marathon;

And this is due to Dr. LUXN!

All bring their maps and some their wives
And at the vision Greece revives!

The fumes that made the Pythian cough
Still permeate the conscious air;
Parnassus, of the arduous "grade,"
May still be clomb, with local aid.

Nightly unwove the work of day,
Staving her suitors off till he,

And on his brave grass-widow's breast
Forgot Calypso and the rest.
In Crete, where Theseus ilrst embrace:!

And follow, to the maze's source,
The thread of some profound discourse.

•So scandalised her mortal kin,
Where young Apollo, lord of light,
Commenced his progress as a twin-
Fair Delos they shall get to know,
And Paros, where the marbles grow.

From faith they move, by way of sight,
To knowledge meant for noble ends;

To work it off upon the boys.

Where certain islands ought to be,
How well to whack him hard and low
And say, " The pain is worse for me,

Familiar, like the Isle of Wight."

•DEAR MR. PUNCH,— Is it possible to
convey some sense of decency into the
mind of the average London County
Councillor? It may be that I wrong this
distinguished personage, and that, travel-
ling to and fro in his luxurious brougham,
capacious barouche or untaxed cart, he is
not aware of the disgraceful scenes which
occur every morning and evening at the
terminal stations of the tram lines at
Blackfriars and Westminster Bridges. The
tram-cars are owned by the London County
Council and they are run at a profit, the
London County Council also supply ticket
inspectors and starters, but they also
provide chaos of the worst order. I
would ask two such staid members of
this august body as Mr. H. W. L. LAWSON
and Mr. JOHN BURNS to spend a couple of
hours on one day in surveying the horrible
scenes which occur when the cars are
arriving and leaving, after "business
hours." Yours, PETER PICOON.

[Interviewed bv an Italian journalist, Madame DVSF. is reported to have
said: "To save the theatre the theatre must be destroyed, and its actors and
actresses must die of the plague. They poison Art. . . . We should return
to the Greeks and play in the open air. Boxes, stalls, . . . kill the drama.
... I want ... the Acropolis. ... I am condemned to play SABDOC and
PIXEBO! . . . If I had my will, I would live in a ship in the middle of the
ocenn."] ,
DEAR lady, the cure -which you kindly propose
For au evil that sounds rather vague
Would not be especially welcome to those
\Vho are destined to die of the plague.
You would sweep every actor and actress away—
They poison the air and their art,
And, affecting the Greeks in your methods, would play
In the open your favourite part.
You deplore the existence of box and of stall,
That are pounding the drama to grit,
But we fear the receipts would be likely to fall
If your theatre were nothing but pit.
And although the Acropolis sounds very nice,
Stone seats and the draught and the rain
Would in all probability amply suffice
To pi-event one from coming again.
The veriest Vandal would tremble to speak
In a tongue that was strange on its stage,
While a scholarly knowledge of Attican Greek
Is scarcely a mark of the age.
PlNEHO and SARDOU are all you may play,
By Fate you are manacled thus,
But, with all due respect, may we venture to say
That they 're not disagreeable to us?
In fine, we implore you to see with our eyes,
And again to consider the case—
Would a ship in mid-ocean be thoroughly wise.
When there 'a no one to reign in your place?
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
M r. TOM GALLON will doubtless learn from many reviewers of
.1 ftof/iic m Loi>e (HUTCHINSON) that he draws his inspiration
from CHARLES DICKENS. "Who deniges of it?" to quote
inquiry by one of the Master's best known people. Certainly
not my Baronite. He recognises in most of the characters,
echoes of earlier acquaintances. But that does not detract
from the charm of the book, its flow of incident, its atmo-
sphere of humour ever ready to blend with pathos. It is just
the book a tired man will like to read after a quiet dinner.
And that is high praise.

Sons of the Morning (METHt'EN) is really a big book, wherein
it differs from the ordinary run of novels. The story, homed on
Dartmoor, shares its grandeur and its mysticism. Mr. EDEN
PHILLPOTTS knows nit fond that strange distinctive clan the
Devonians, and gives us some delightful records of their sayings
and doings. His descriptions of Dartmoor in sunlight and storm
are finely done. It would be hard to beat the picture of a
storm which brings the drama to a climax. The pure, strong,
literary style of the narrative is refreshing. Like THACKERAY,
though in quite a different way, Mr. PHILLPOTT8 is a preacher as
well as a novelist. He does not shrink from the oft-attempted
task of defining humour. "It is," he writes, "a balm of life;
it is the root of tolerance, the prop of patience; it suffers long,
and is kind ; keeps the heart of man sweet, his soul modest. And
at the end, when the light thickens and tho mesh grows tight,
humour can sharo the suffering vigils of the sleepless, can
soften pain, can brighten the ashy road to death." My Baronite,
brought up in the House of Commons—where a high flight of
humour is recognised when a member marks the conclusion of
his speech by sitting on his hat—begins to understand.
My Baronite envies A. T. QriLLER-Corcn the labour of love
he has perfected in the production of The Oxford Book of
English Verse (HENRY FROWDE). What daisied pastures he has
strolled through, what fragrant gardens he has culled! His
task carries him back over more than COO years of the British
Poets, not forgetting those who touched the Irish harp. Some
are new to the average reader, most are very dear. The plea-
sure of reading them all again is added to by the dainty form in
which they issue from the Oxford Press. The casket is worthy
of the treasure it contains.

The Baron confesses to knowing next to nothing of the talk,
habits, and manners of the privates in the British Army. Mr-
KIPLING'S Muh'tnnj and his companions may be true to facts,
and if they are, so much the worse for the facts, or they may
have been highly-coloured fancy-portraits, intended more for our
amusement than for our instruction or edification. Be that as
it may, the Baron never took kindly to them, became, in fact,
rather bored by them (of course, the more 's the pity), and finally
felt inclined to adopt towards the British Tommy Kiplinised a
sentiment similar to that expressed by Betsy Prig towards Mm.
Harris, and avow "I don't believe there ain't no such person,"
i.e. as represented in the popular KIPLING romances. And the
Baron is more than ever convinced of tho probability that there
is good ground for his opinion after reading the dramatically-
written Military Dialogues on Active Serfire, by Lieut.-Colonel
N. IS'EWNHAM DAVIS (SANDS & Co.), which are thoroughly inte-
resting, and so artistically contrived as to be here and there
enlivened with effects that are genuinely sensational. The
sketches, too, all in dialogue, of the officers' wives, are very
interesting; and those of the "girls they (the soldiers) leave
behind them" seem thoroughly natural to the Baron, who has
small experience of the former, and none whatever of the latter
in this category. Taking for granted that the author, being a
Lieutenant-Colonel, is thoroughly familiar with all the military
subjects he has here taken in hand, the Baron begs to recom-
mend it, especially in this sad time of war, to all civilians, as
the work of an expert who knows what he is talking almut.
But what has become of the rollicking gaiety of the young
and old campaigners as pourtrayed by CHARLES LKVER in his
Hurry Lnn-eqiier, Jack Hinton the (humltnuiH, and his diaries
Mtilleii? Where 's ymirMickey Free now? These, truly, were
to tho Baron " ideals." Is it possible they were never "reals"?

A LETTER TO A YOUNG PUBLISHER.
II.
IN thanking me for the hints I
gave
you recently on the art of advertising,
you observe that even though you sell
a largo number of copies, advertising is
an expensive business, and that the net
pecuniary gain to yourself of what is
called a "successful" novel is by no
means large. Moreover, you add, suc-
cessful authors are few in number, and
have a nasty trick of insisting upon un-
commonly high royalties.
My dear JONES, if you are really to
succeed in your busi-
ness, you must un-
derstand at once that
the bulk of your in-
come is to come not
from the successful
books, but (paradox
as it seems) from tho
unsuccessful. The
successful man knows
too much, or his inte-
rests are looked after
by an agent, which
comes to pretty well
the same thing, so far
as you are concerned.
But the beginner—
the aristocratic young
lady,the younggentlc-
man fresh fromOxford,
the country gentle-
man who suddenly
gives -way to the
mcocthes ac.rlbcnili—•
these, dear JoNKi, are
in reality your most
valuable clients,
whose usefulness is
liuiili-il only at one
end by their gulli-
bility, and at the
other by their bank-
ing-accounts. Yon
sent me a MS. as a
specimen of the hope-
less rubbish daily sub- .Buf Conductor_
mitted to you, and
your intention, I gather, was to return
it promptly to its author. Nothing, I
assure you, could be more gratuitously
f'X)lish. I have read Heart-Throbs — as
MS. Of course, you will add, there is
grave risk about bringing out the work of
an unknown man, but, in consideration of
the exceptional merit of Heart-Throbs, you
are willing to brave it. All that you will
ask the author to do is to pay £80 towards
tho cost of production, while you will
undertake to supply the demand up to a
thousand copies. On all copies sold above
that number you will pay him a royalty of
twenty or thirty—you can promise safely
anything you like—per cent.
The author will be delighted at the
reader's "favourable report." He may
boggle a bit about the £80, in which case

And, if you like, you can send in by-and-
bye another bill of £10 or so for "adver-
tising," and "cost of extra proof correc-
tions." If ho remonstrates, you can talk
gravely of your risk, your heavy office-
expenses, etc., und you will be surprised
and grieved that the sale of the book has
not got beyond 50 copies. It is just
possible that at this point your client
may go to the Society of Authors, but
that needn't concern you. You have
made your £50 or £68 out of Heart-
Throbs, and the supply of fools, thank
heaven! is unfailing. Only, you will
deplore his lack of confidence, and the
passing away of the
good old days, when
no Authors' Societies
existed.

your estimate of it. Moro undiluted
drivel it would be hard to conceive. It
is dull, foolish, badly-written; without
one redeeming feature. But as for re-
turning it, that would be nothing less
than tho criminal waste of an opportu-
nity. Follow my instructions, and you
shall make a pretty penny out of Hearl-
Tlirobs.

CONVERSATIONAL
HINTS FOR
CHAPTEU V.
YOUNG EIDERS.
Of Chances for Talk—Shooting and Hunting—Of Dropping a .S7ioe—
An Over-reach and other matters.
IT is, undoubtedly, I fear, the case that in hunting, conver-
sational ability is not at so high a premium as in shooting.
There is less opportunity for the easy, pleasant talk that makes
up so large a part of the day's sport with the gun. Men have
to manage their horses, to watch the hounds, to study the
country, to make sure they are not left behind when the fox
breaks away, and, generally, to look closely after the business
on which they have come out. The shooting man, on the other
hand, except during the minutes when the birds are actually
coming over him, can make his day into one long opportunity
for conversation of various
kinds. When the beat on the
drive is over and the birds are
collected; while the guns walk
on to take their places at the
next stand; at lunch and after;
on the walk home when the day
is done—during all these in-
tervals and cessations there
are countless chances for the
skilled conversationalist. But
in the hunting field, as I have
said, the openings are fewer
and circumstances too often
check the flow of soul. Still,
a wary man will get his chances
even in hunting and, the fewer
they are, the more necessary
is it to take proper advantage
of them.
In the first place you will
have observed, though you are
a novice at the game, that you
are always entitled to tell any
man that his horse has lost a
shoe. Even if he moves in
gilded circles, irradiated by
Dukes and Earls, and you are
a mere son of the soil, the rule
holds good. If you doubt what
I say, just select a man whose
horse has dropped a shoe, men-
tion the fact to him, and then
keep close to him for a few minutes while you are riding,
as wo may suppose, from one covert to another, no fox being
at the moment on the move. The next man who comes up
in the track of the horse with three shoes, will go through
the same little pantomime as you did. He '11 take a good
look, pull back his horse a bit, look again, ride closer, gaze
intently and then, evidently making up his mind to stake
his whole reputation for eyesight and knowledge, will break
out with "You've lost a shoe, Sir, near fore-foot." If the
interval of easy riding last long enough, you will observe a dozen
men go through this identical performance one after another,

IMITATION
expect to have the matter mentioned to you even by men you
don't know. "I'm afraid you've got rather a nasty over-
reach," is a fairly good formula for tho occasion—and even
when you arc tried by tho repetition time after time of this
observation, you ought to remember that it is prompted by
good-will, by a desire to point out to you what you cannot see
for yourself, and so to enable you to save from more serious
damage the gallant horse whose welfare ought to be as close to
your heart as your own.
If a man loses his spur, or batters his hat, or gets his face
torn by a twig, or his coat covered with mud from a fall, you
will not, unless he should happen to bo your friend, call his
attention to facts which are entirely within his own knowledge
and are probably causing him acute discomfort. But how shall
a rider know that his horse has dropped a shoe or over-reached?
His horse, the much-enduring, indomitably courageous com-
panion of his sport, is unable
to give him a hint, except by
going lame—and then the mis-
chief is done.
So it has come to bo recog-
nised as a humane duty on the
part of riders to give one an-
other information on such
matters, and no rule drawn
from that gorgeous guide,
"The Manners of Good Society;
By One "Who is in It," will be
broken if a gentleman hitherto
unknown to you should address
you in the manner I have de-
scribed. Besides, if you are
going to bo stand-offish iu the
hunting field, if you are going
to inflate yourself with dignity
and make yourself rigid with
arrogance, and scowl and talk
of "devilish impertinence"
just because little cheery DICK
TADWORTH makes a remark to
you in his genial Cockney way,
why you'd bettor stay at home
and feed on BURKE'S Peerages
and other books of social pre-
cedence. The hunting field is
no place for you. There DICK
is your equal, though the
blood of kings should happen
(in a slightly diluted form) to
run in your veins, and DICK has nothing to back him except
a clever head for figures, perfect good nature, and a desire
to be on good terms with all the world. Of course, Din;
mustn't push too much—in any case, he's not tho man to do
that, for there's nothing of the Snob in him, and if he errs he
errs without ill-will or mean aspiration of any kind.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MY HOLIDAY.
(A Coji/ession).
IN the first place, I blame the doctor.
He shouldn't have used long words and
looked at me as if I was something under
the microscope. But when a man has the
word "neurosthenic" flung at him he is
obliged, in self-defence, to do something,
and so I accepted his Mephistophelean
suggestion about country air and a few
days' quiet. He even hypnotised me into
the belief that I was tired of town (shade
of CHARLES LAMB forgive me!), and I
agreed to go right away into the country
for a week—down to a friend's country
house near Lynton.
It's my firm belief that if I had taken
a day—choosing my weather—down in
Surrey: or a week-end at Brighton, el-
even a day in bed, I should have been per-
fectly right again. But I was fool enough
to be beguiled by the doctor, and
Well, it's no use repining now.
I really think (to be perfectly just to
myself) that I was for a few hours on the
first evening—perhaps even for an houi1
or so next morning—genuinely contented.
The quiet soothed me. With Mr. PKCK-
SXIFF I contemplated existence, and then,
alas, like Mr. PECKSNIFF, I assumed a role
of horrible duplicity. On the second day
the quietness of the Devonshire hills
grated terribly on my nerves, and I longed
for the soothing roar of the London traffic.
But I assumed a look of placid pleasure,
ard even feebly thanked goodness when
I heard that London papers came a day
late. Humbug! hypocrite! that I was.
But Nemesis overtook me. Try as I might,
I could not conceal the awful depression
that was stealing over me.
On the fourth day there was a prospect
that the road might be blocked. Horror!
I made up my mind.
"TOM," 1 said, "don't be alarmed, old
man, but I feel that I ought to consult
some specialist: the fact is, I "here
I tapped my chest ambiguously.
"Rot!" said TOM. (There 'H a refresh-
ing frankness about TOM.) "Take a
twenty-mile walk, and you 'II lie as iltasa
fiddle." With some experience of musical
relations, I derived no consolation from
this simile.
"Possibly," I said, •with affected
stoicism; "and yet I can't help remem-
bering that Uncle PETER '' I shrugged
my shoulder, and left Uncle PKTKR'S fate
to TOM'S imagination.
"Well, come down when you've seen
him. You can't do better thnu stop here."
"I will, I will," I interrupted fever-
ishly, then rushed off to pack. The
next afternoon 1 was gliding through
Westbourne Park in a (J.W. train (blessings
on it!) feeling almost delirious with joy.
"Foggy, as usual," said a man opposite.
I gave an imbecile grin. "Yes," I
said, "just the same dear old yellow,
throat-choking friend."
He regarded me amazed. "The filthy
condition of the roads," he said, "is
scandalous ; the Local Board"
"I know," I said. "Never mind.
Shouldn't we bo disgusted if everything
was spick and span? What should we talk
about on the morning 'bus, or in the
matutinal tube! Hurrah for the London
dirt!"
We drew up at Paddington. I bought
up all the evening papers, and gave the
hansom driver a royal fee.
Specialists be blowcd. Country be
blowed. I sat down and wrote to TOM.
I told him I had been a liar and a humbug;
and that although I loved him dearly,
nothing would persuade me to see him
in the winter-time. When I am calmer I
shall write to the doctor. A.R.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARL
DEAMATIC SEQUELS.
III.—HAMLET.
AMONG the plays which seem specially
to require a sequel, Hamlet must certainly
be reckoned. The end of Act V. left the
distracted kingdom of Denmark bereft
alike of King, Queen, and Heir-Pre
sumptive. There were thus all the
materials for an acute political crisis. It
might have been imagined that the crown
would fall inevitably to the Norwegian
Prince FoRTIXBRAS who, being on the spot
with an army behind him, certainly seems
to have neglected his chances. It is clear,
however, from the sequel that FORTIX-
BRAS failed to rise to the occasion, and
that HORATIO, being more an antique
Roman than a Dane, seized his oppor-
tunity and by a coup d'etat got posses-
sion of the vacant throne. Nor would
FORTINBRAS appear to have resented this,
as we flnd him subsequently visiting
HORATIO at Elsinore. There is, however,
a Nemesis which waits upon Usurpers, as
the sequel shows. The sequel,, by the
way, should have been called (.tliosts,
but as that title has been already appro-
priated by a lesser dramatist, the name
has been changed to—•

can't agree with you.
I shall stay here.
[.Sits down resolutely with his ba<;k to
the. castle.
Forlinbras (turning up his coat, collar
resignedly). It "s perfect rot, you
know,
To let yourself be frightened by a Ghost!
H. (angrily). A Ghost! You 're always
so inaccurate!
Nobody minds a spectre at the feast
Less than HORATIO, but a dozen spectres,
All sitting round your hospitable board
And clamouring for dinner, are a sight
No one can bear with equanimity.
Of course, I know it's different for you.
You- don't believe in ghosts! . . . Ugh,
what was that?
F. Nothing.
H. I "m sure I saw a figure moving
there.
F. Absurd! It's far too dark to sec
at all.
(AnjHmentatively), After all, what are
ghosts?
In the most high and palmy state of Rome
A little ere the mightiest JULIUS fell,
People saw hoards of them! Just ring
for lights,
And let us make ourselves as comfortable
As this inclement atmosphere permits.
H. (despondently). I 'd ring with plea-
sure, if I thought the bell
Had any prospect of being answered.
But as there's not a servant in the
house
F. (annoyed). Xo servants?
H. (bitterly). As my genial friend,
MACBETH,
Would probably have put it, "Not a maid
Is left this vault to brag of." In other
words,
They left en masse this morning.
F. Dash it all!
Something is rotten in the state of Den-
mark
When you, its reigning monarch, cannot
keep
Your servants for a week.
H. (sadly). Ah, FoRTIXBRAS,
If you inhabited a haunted castle
You 'd flnd your servants would give
warning too.
It's not as if we only had one ghost.
They simply swann! (Ticking them off on
his fingers.) There 's HAMLET'S father.
He walks the battlements from ten to five.
You '11 see him here in half an hour or so.
CLAUDIUS, the late King, haunts the State
apartments,
The QUERN the keep, OPHELIA the moat,
And ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN the
hall.
POLONIUS you will usually flnd
Behind the arras murmuring platitudes,
And HAMLET stalking in the corridors.
Alas, poor ghost 1 his fatal indecision
Pursues him still. He can't make up his
mind
Which rooms to take—you 're never safe
from him!
F. But why object to meeting HAMLET'S
Ghost?
I 've hoard he was a most accomplished
Prince,
A trifle, fat and scant of breath, perhaps;
But then a disembodied HAMLET
Would doubtless show a gratifying change
In that respect.
H. (irritably). I tell you, FORTINBRAS,
It's not at all a theme for joking.
However, when the New Wing's finished
I shall move in, and all the ghosts in limbo
May settle here as far as I 'm concerned.
F. When will that be?
H. The architect declares
He'll have the roof on by the end of
March.
F. (rising briskly). It is a nipping and
an eager air,
Suppose we stroll and see it?
H. (rising also). With all my heart.
Indeed, I think we 'd better go at once.
[Looks at watch.
The Ghost of HAMLET'S father 's almost
due.
His morbid love of punctuality
Makes him arrive upon the stroke of ten,
And as the castle clock is always fast
He's rather apt to be before his time.
[The clock begins to strike as they
exeunt hastily. On the last stroke,
Ghost enters.
Ghost. I am HAMLET'S father's spirit,
Doomed for a certain term to walk the
night,
And for the day ....
[Stops, seeing no one there.
What! Nobody about?
Why, this is positively disrespectful.
I '11 wait until HORATIO returns
And, when I 've got him quietly alone,
I will a tale unfold will make him jump!
[Sits rfoirii resolutely to ivait for
HORATIO.

SCENE II.—Before the Neto Wing of the

tremely leisurely fashionio be expected
of artiziins who are not members of

1st Cioirn (in Ins best Elizabethan
manner). Nay, but hear you, goodman
builder
2nd Clown (in homely vernacular). Look
here, BILL, you can drop that jargon.
There's no one here but ourselves, and I
ain't amused by it. It's all very well
to try it on when there's gentlefolk
about, but when we 're alone you take a
rest.
1st Clown (puzzled). Ay, marry!
2nd Clown (throwing down tools). Stow
it, I say, or I '11 have to make you. Marry,
indeed! If you mean " Yes," say "Yes."
If you mean " No," say "No."
1st Clown. All right, mate.
2nd Clown (grumbling). It's bad enough
staying up all night building more rooms
on to this confounded castle — I should
have thought it was big enough and ugly
enough without our additions — but if
I 'm to listen to your gab, s'help ine!
1st Clown. Hush! here comes some
le.
[They make a valiant pretence of work
as HORATIO and FOHTINBRAS enter.
Horatio (ecstatically, completely deceived
by this simple ruse). My Master-Builders!
Fortinbras. Idle dogs!
1st Clown (Elizabethan again). Argal,
goodman builder, will he nill he, he that
builds not ill builds well, and he that
builds not well builds ill. Therefore,

H. (to F.). Ha! Ha! Good again. By

say, the toe of the peasant comes so near
the heel of the courtier, it galls his kibe.
F. (savagely). The toe of the courtier is
getting so perilously near the person of
the peasant that you 'd better get rid of
the latter as soon as possible.
H. (doubtfully). Perhaps you're right.
And yet I was always taught to consider

THANK goodness, no more
Will this wretched exotic
Annoy us, and bore
With refrain idiotic.
No more can it bloom
With the flowers of diction
And French that find room
In feminine fiction.

Out-of-date 'tis at last,
In the tick of a second;
When the Century passed.
Dead also 'twas reckoned.
No longer 'twill fit
Aberrations of fashion,
The vagaries of wit,
Or the problems of passion.

SECOND SERIES.
I.—THE MEDIEVAL SECTION.
(With tlie Author's compliments to Mr. Maurice Hewlett.)
JANUARY IST, 2ND.—But at the high board sat My Lord de
DURDANS, named of his enemies ARCHIBALD YEA-AND-NAY, for
that first he would and then -he would not, for over-asking.
And by him was Sir HENRY COP-LA-POULB, sire of ELAINE LA
HUMOROUS, and about him much company of chapmen of the
Shires. And "Oyez! good Sirs," cried he, "I give you rumour
of war; not for fair lands, since none such be left to raid,
but for gold, that yellow peril, the quest of great hearts. And
herein victory shall be to the loudest voice; and that land
shall go under, ours or another, that cannot bruit abroad her
wares to the welkin. A murrain, say I, on false shame 1 Shall
any reave us of our right to be esteemed a nation of bagmen?
Never, pardie I"
3RD, 4TH.—Now to the lieges of his Suzerain Lady came
challenge of tourney from OOM of the Doppers, Lord of
Outrevalles. And BOUGEGARDE the trobador smote on his tam-
bour and made a Chanson des Pauvres Diables Distraictz.
And the lists were straightly set in Val de Long-Tomps. And
the hollow plain was ribbed with naked rocks, grey kopjes
crowning all. And from the borders of Our Lady of the Snows,
and from Isles of the Southern Cross, flew winged proffers of
vassal service, and the cry of knighthood calling to saddle and
spur. And it was really rather curious. For My Lord RED-
TAPE, out of his great knowledge of warlike matters, made
retort courteous, saying, "Oy deus! what should we with
horse? Send us foot!"
5TH, 6TH.—But by force of whelming numbers and a. stub-
born hardihood begot of British beef, they overbore no few of
the chivalry of Oom; a%d some they made captive before ever
they could mount and invite the hills to cover them. There-
upon a remnant of England's knighthood, composite of the
heavy sort and such as go in housings of blue (for a sprinkling
of actual horsemen had joined issue with the foe in the melee),
made their ways homeward. And Le Sieur BOBS DE KANDAHAR,
holding that the tourney was accomplished, himself took ship
whence he came. At this the heathen, emerging from their
parole or other sanctuary, rallied for the onset; and they
swept the lists like an Egypt's plague of locusts. And about
the time of the seventeenth moon (shaped sickle-wise for sign
of a bloody aftermath) the new Lord RED-TAPB (for the former
had been lifted nighcr the throne as one that had the French
speech most nimble on his tongue) woke from a drugged sleep
on a cry of danger, calling "To horse! A crown a day, and
d n the expense!" So, the traverse being a windy matter
at this season, there was mounting in rod haste against the
second anniversary of the tourney.
7m, STH.—Meanwhile to the tents of the puissant and most
Christian DE WET came heralds for parley. Now you shall know
that he was the match of three Icoparcla for padded cunning
and agility. It was a dog-cat nature, keen nose and mobile paw.
And the envoys of peace he bade take and flog, and the third he
foully slew. But the tidings of this same feat of arms was
brought to Lord OOM, lying perdu among the oversea Dutch.
And him the messengers found helmed in the beaver's pelt, deep
in Holy Writ, psalter at elbow. And on the hearing of their tale
he lifted strained eyes from the page of DAVID and said: "By
the rood, Sirs, 'twas well done!"
DTH.—Now at the very sable of fog-tide you must understand
that they play Moralities on the dun banks of Thames. And of
such are^the moving histories of Sir Richard de Whittingtoune,
La Belle Dormeuse, Damosel Rouge-Cape, The Forest Infanta,
Mistress Cendrillon (called Cinderella of the Fur Slipper, though
certain lack-lores would have her shod not in vair, which is to
say fur, but verre, namely glass), Jacques Mort-au-Qeant and
Aladdin of tlie Lamp Merveilloiis (out of Araby). Follows a
sample or so in this kind.
10TH TO 12TH.—Whether it was the red wine, or the splitting
of crackers, or else her cinder-hot beauty, I know not, that set
the Prince's heart oil sudden flre. Certes, he caught her to his
knee in the eyes of all the gaping meinie.
"Vair-slipper," he cried, "your little foot is on my neck;
your slave am I already. Make me your Prince I"
"Lord, say not that," said Mistress CENDRILLON. Ashen
were her cheeks against the blue flame of her hair. Twice
round her brows it went, and the pigtail's ending slept between
her breasts. "Lord," says she, "it can never be. The
humming-bird may not mate with the titmouse."
"By my halidom," he cried, "but it shall be so, ma mye."
"Lord!" she murmured, "the hour is close on middle night;
let me away 1"
She slipped like green water from his rocky arms. "Nay,
popinjay," he cried, "it is the hour of Philomel. Stay with
me till she withdraw before the early throstle."
For all answer, light as a beam of Diaii she slid down the ban-
nisters and so past the drowsy cloak-room sentinels. Midnight
carillon, peeling from a hundred belfries, snapped the wand of
faerie. Into the sheer starlight flitted the shadow of a homing
wench, clad in most pitiful poor gear. My Lord Prince, hot
in pursuit, stood rooted to earth, chanting a forlorn stave of
"Le Tresor des Humbles." Against the nap of his sapphire
vest he held a Slipper of Vair chance-dropped in the princely
purlieus.
18TH TO 15TH.—Young Spring was waking in the high woods.
Now was the pairing-time of amorous fowls in burgeoned brakes.
Earth turned in her sleep with a throb of surging sap. Lush
hyacinths spread a gossamer web to veil her bridals. Hand in
hand, as became orphans of one ravaged house, the Forest
Infants paced under boon boughs.
"Parbleu," said FULK, that was right heir of this goodly
demesne, " but I have an aching maw!"
"And I," said his sister ALYS, "I also could do with a
devilled ortolan."
"'Tis a dog of an uncle!" said FULK, with a round oath that
your Gascon trooper might repeat, not I.
"And the aunt a vile ferret," replied ALYS, and wept for
mere emptiness.
"Mort de mamere," cried FULK, " 'tis ill work ambling thus.
Let us lie close in the quick undergrowth, and woo dreams of
potted lobster, first having shriven our dusty souls."
And so they found them after a many days, stark, each in the
other's gripe. And their pall was wrought of the dead leaves
of yesteryear. The robins had done it. The red of their breasts
•was, I take it, the passionate heart's blood that showed through.

Lord DouBLESlllRE entertained a small
party of friends at his town house last
evening. After dinner the servants
mingled freely with the guests, and the
Marchioness of STOKE NEWINGTON was
presented to the second stair-maid, Miss
ELIZABETH WILKINS, whoso acquaintance
she made.
Among the smart "bridge" parties
last week must be numbered Mrs. ALOEY
BOU.NCKBY'S. Her butler, THOMAS SCRAGGS,
•who paired for the first rubber with the
Duke of DUNKIRK, is fast proving his
claim to bo one of the finest exponents of
this fashionable card game.
We understand that the Countess of
CRUMBLBTON has issued cards to a dis-
tinguished but select few to meet her
coachman, Mr. JOHN JENKINS.
At the theatre the other evening, con-
spicuous among a remarkably well-dressed
set of people, wo noticed Lord LouGimoiiO,
the Hon. Misses LODGHBORO, and the head
gardener, K/.HKIEL JILKS. The latter gen-
tleman wore the famous silver Albert
watch-chain, a Christmas present, it is
understood, from Miss GWENDOLEN LODGH-
BORO, the bestowal of which gift has
aroused so much comment in aristocratic
and horticultural circles.
Half-a-dozen dissatisfied members of
Brooks's club are talking of resigning if
Lord LIVEWELL'S groom is not black-balled.
Ho was of course put up by Lord LIVE-
WELL himself and seconded by his uncle,
Earl GOTHEPACE. One or two rumours
have certainly reached us reflecting on
the temperance of BOB "WHIPPET, the
handsome groom. But for the old-fashioned
prejudices which evidently animate the
action of the discontented six, wo have
nothing but the severest reproof.
Owing to the severe illness of Miss
MADELINE MARROWBY, the stall at the
forthcoming Bazaar will be taken by her
maid ELLKN CRIFPS. As previously ar-
ranged, the stall-holders will bo presented
individually to the Royal Visitors.
In the forthcoming golf competition, at
Hoylake, Miss SUHAN BATES, the scullery-
maid to Hon. Miss PITZWINTBB, is looked
on as a likely prize winner. Her handi-
cap playing has shown a wonderful im-
provement lately, so much so that her
considerate mistress has given her per-
mission to forego her ordinary duties ol
washing up the dishes and filling the
coal scuttles, in order that she may gel
in a good morning's practise on the links
Among the presentations for the nexl

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
How Granfer Volunteered.
By M. B. FRANCIS.
FAKMBR SAMPSON rolled slowly homewards after church one
•wintry Sunday, full of a comfortable sense of righteousness,
and looking forward to a reposeful hour before the mid-day
meal. He exchanged greetings with his neighbours, discussed
with them the probability of "snow-stuff" coming, or the
likelihood of "its taking up" that night. Being an affable
man, his opinion invariably coincided with that of the last
person who spoke to him.
Arrived at his own substantial dwelling, and pausing a
moment, on passing through the kitchen, to inhale the fra-
grance of the roasting joint, he proceeded flrst to the best
parlour, an awe-inspiring room, never used save for a christen-
ing or a funeral; a shrine for stuffed birds, wax fruits and
flowers, unopened books and the family's best wearing apparel.
Mrs. SAMPSON'S Sunday bonnet reposed in the bandbox beneath
the sofa; the accompanying gown was stowed away on one of
the shelves of the bureau; other garments, belonging respec-
tively to children and grand-children, wore hidden beneath
silver paper in other receptacles; and the master of the house,
now divesting himself of his broadcloth coat, hung it carefully
on the back of a chair, and restored his hat to the peg allotted
to it behind tho door. Then, making his way to the family
living-room, he assumed his white "pinner" — a clean one,
which had been laid ready for him on the table—took up the
newspaper, sat down in the wide armchair by the hearth, which
his substantial figure filled to a nicety, drew his spectacles
from his pocket, and began to read. But, as he slowly spelt
out line after line, his forefinger moving along the column on
which his eyes rested, the air of contentment with which he
at flrst settled to his task gave way, first to an expression of
puzzled astonishment, then to one of irresolution, and, finally,
to absolute consternation. After, however, reading and re-
reading the paragraph which had attracted his attention in
the Western Weekly, scratching his head, rubbing his nose,
drumming with his fingers on the table; and, in fact, availing
himself to. the full of every recognised aid to thought, his brow
cleared, and bringing one mighty clenched hand down on the
open palm of the other, he exclaimed aloud:
"I'11 do it! I'm blest if I don't do it; my dooty do stare
me in the face."
Thereupon, wheeling round slowly in his chair so as to face
the door—a matter of some little difficulty—he proceeded to
call, or rather to bellow, at the top of his voice. "Missus!
Grandma! Come here, will 'ee? POLLY, ANNIE—be there any-
one about? Here, little 'uns, go an' fetch Grandma, one on
you. Mis-sus!"
Presently there was a rush of feet, and Mrs. SAMPSON entered,
followed by her married daughter POLLY, with three or four
children clinging to her skirts, while Maidy ANNIE, the father's
favourite, hastened in from the rear.
"Bless me, Granfer! Whatever be the matter?" inquired
his wife anxiously.
Good old SAMPSON had been known as "Father," in the
family circle for many a year, until POLLY and her husband
had taken up their abode at the farm, when the title of
"Granfer," naturally used by the children, had come to be
universally adopted.
"There be matter enough for one while," he now responded
gloomily, and yet with a certain air of dignified triumph.
"Dear heart alive, they Boers b'ain't a-coming to fight us
over here, be they?" cried ANNIE, who was an imaginative
young person.
"There 's no knowin' what they '11 be a-thinkin' on if we
don't look out," responded her father, importantly. "It
b'ain't so much the Boers," he continued, with a superior air,
"'tis the French as wo must be on our guard again'—an" the
Germans—an' the Rooehans," he cried, emphatically, his eyes
growing wider and wider as he named each nationality. "They
do say as they do all hate us worse nor p'ison, and is only lookin'
for an opportunity for attackin' us."
"Dear! dear! ye don't say so!" groaned Mrs. SAMPSON.
"'Tis worse nor in BONEY'S time. Lard! I can mind my father
tell in1 mo as when he was a boy they was expectin' for sure as
BONEY 'ud land, and the country very near went mad wi'
fright. An' now ye say there be more nor the French again
us?"
"Whatever is to be done?" put in POLLY. "I can't think
as there can be many soldiers a-left i' the country wi' them
great ships-full goin' out week arter week. Who 's to defend
us if any o' them folks from abroad do come?"
Granfer looked slowly round from one anxious face to the
other, rolled his head from side to side, heavod a deep sigh, and
finally remarked in a sepulchral tone:
"There's summat a-goin' to be done, ye might be sure." He
paused, nodded, smoothed out the paper on his knee, and finally
handed it with a tragic air to ANNIE.
"See here, my maid," he said, indicating a certain-paragraph
with his broad thumb; "read this here to your mother an" all
on us. Then ye '11 see what's a-goin' to be done!"
He threw himself back in his chair, while ANNIE, somewhat
mystified and a good deal alarmed, read the following:
"Her Majesty the QUEBN has been graciously pleased to
invite her old soldiers to return to service again for one year,
for tho defence of the country during the absence of her armies
in South Africa.
"The text of the proclamation posted at the War Office will
be found in another column. Such an appeal will be warmly
responded to by many a loyal British heart; our veterans will
rejoice at the opportunity thus afforded them of proving their
devotion to Queen and Country."
"Well," said Mrs. SAMPSON, in a relieved tone. "Think o'
that now! I 'm sure there be a good few old soldiers about, an'
it '11 be very nice for 'cm to get a chance of doin" summat."
"Very nice!" shouted her lord, with unaccountable fierce-
ness. "Very nice, do ye say? That be your notion, be it? Well,
I did look for a bid more feelin' from you. A man may be willin'
to do his dooty, an' yet he mid find it oncomroen hard work!"
"Why, Granfer, what be tnlkin' about? I'm sure I
never ''
"Do you suppose, Missus, as us old folks won't find it a bit
agin' us to go shootin' an' manoverin' an sich like at our time
o' life? Wi' the best heart in the world, I reckon we be like to
find it a bit stiff."
"Bless me, SAMPSON, don't tell I as you 've a-got a notion o'
j'inin' the army at your time o' life. Lard save us!" she
continued, with gathering irritation, "I do believe you've
a-took leave of your senses!"
"My dear woman," returned the farmer, "I do 'low it will
have gived ye a bit of a turn ; but there 'tis, wrote plain for all
to read: 'Her Majesty the QUEEN have invited her old soldiers
to serve'—if Her Majesty have a-made up her mind as 'tis old
soldiers she wants, it b'ain't for the likes of us to go again* it.
I 've alays heerd tell as the QUEEN were an oncommon sensible
woman, an' she 've a-found out most like as these hare
youngsters b'ain't to be trusted—ye can't expect old heads on
young shoulders. I never did hold wi' them there notions o'
shart service, an' havin' nothin* but lads i' th' army; an' Her
Majesty—d' ye see, Her Majesty—do very like agree wi' I."
"Well but, Granfer," said POLLY, doubtfully, "d1 ye think
the QUEEN did mean soldiers as had—as had left off practising
so long as you?"
"An', besides," put in ANNIE, quickly, "'tisn't same as if you
was ever a regular soldier in barracks an' that. Ye did only go
out wi' the Yeomanry, didn't ye?"
"Well," returned her father, indignantly, "an* will'ee go

for to tell I as a man as was twenty year a trooper in the
Darset Yeomanry b'ain't a soldier! Why what else be he then?
Ye be a voolish maid, my dear, very voolish!"
"But," gasped poor Mrs. SAMPSON, recovering breath at last,
"'tis thirty year an" more, I "m sure, since ye did go out wi'
'em! Ah! I'm sure 'tis thirty year—'twas when poor HARRY
•was a baby as ye did give up, an' long afore POLLY was born."
"Now, I tell '«•<• what, Missus, this here kind o' talk isn't the
proper talk for them as loves Queen and Country. What do the
papers say? Read yourself, an' see. If every old soldier in the
country was to go makin' excuses, an' thinkin' this, that an'
t'other, who 's to defend England? Now I 'm a old man, an' a
bit stiff i' the j'ints, an' a bit heavy on my legs, but I can get
on a harse, and pull a trigger yet. And I 'm not the roan to go
and disapp'int the QUEEN. There! My mind bo made up, an' ye
may tark till midnight wi'out changin' it."
"Well, to be sure," said poor Grandma, dropping into a chair,
"I must say I didn't think as I should live to see this day.
When a body comes to your time o' life I didn't look for ye to
be tarkin' o' goin' off to the war, jist at our busiest time o' year
too, when we may be lookin' out for new calves any day, and
the lambin' season not half over."
"'Tis a bit ark'ard, that I must agree," returned SAMPSON,
his face falling as he spoke. "Ah, I eould ha' wished as Her
Majesty hadn't a-called upon us in the midst o' lambiu' time.
We must do the best we can, that's all. TOM must see to things.
I 'd 'low other folks find it jist so hard to leave their businesses.
But when you comes to talk in' o' my years, Missus, you do
make a mistake. 'Tis my years as makes my services valuable.
Now, ANNIE, read what's wrote here about the men comin' up.'1
ANNIE dolorously found the place, and read how already the
response throughout the country had been unanimous, and how
men were turning up by hundreds at various military depots to
offer their services.
"Ah I" commented Granfer reflectively, "the nearest
military deepotts. Let me see; ours 'ud be Blanchester, I sup-
pose. Well, Missus, make up your mind to it; I '11 be off to~
morrow. When a thing must be done, it must be done."
Mrs. SAMPSON threw her apron over her head, and began to
weep. POLLY sniffed ominously, the children wailed, and
ANNIE, flinging her arms round her father's neck, besought him
to think better of it.
"There, to be sure! What a fuss ye do make," cried he,
struggling in her embrace. "What be all in such a stew about,
eh? I b'ain't a-goin' off to fight the Boers, I tell 'ee. I be
a-goin' for to bide here and defend the country if the French
or the Roosians comes this way. As like as not, I shall be able
to come back'ards and for'ards pretty often to see how ye be
all a-gettin' on. There, I tell 'ee ye should take more thought
for I, and not go a-upsettin' of I this way. 'Tis 'ard enough
for I as 'tis 1" And here the large face which was looking dis-
consolately over ANNIE'S shoulder assumed a purple hue, and
big tears gathered in Granfer's usually merry eyes.
"There," he added weakly, as, freeing one hand from his
daughter's somewhat strangulating caresses, he produced a
large red-and-yellow handkerchief, and proceeded to mop his
eyes, "you did ought to help I instead of hinderin' of 11 You
do all owe a dooty to Queen and Country yourselves."
After this appeal to the better feelings of the family, all
opposition was withdrawn, and presently they fell to discuss-
ing arrangements for the carrying out of his Spartan intent.
"My uniform is laid by safe enough, I know," said Granfer,
"but 'tis a question whether 'twill flt mo or no. I've got a
bit stoutish since I left off wearing of 'en."
"Lard man I the jacket "11 not come within a yard o' meetin'
—ye be twice so big round as ye did used to be; an" as for the
trousers—there, there 's no use thinkin' of 'em! They 'd no
more flt 'ee nor they would little JACK IK there."
"Them trousers as ye 've a-got on 'ud do very well, though,"
said POLLY. "They 're dark, d 'ye see."
'I'll have to ride, though," said her father thoughtfully.
"E'es—bein' in the Yeomanry, d'ye see, I'm bound to ride.
'Twouldn't look no-ways respectful like if I didn't offer myself,
harse an' all."
"Well, I 'in sure I don't know what harse ye '11 take, wi'out
it's Chrissy," returned Mrs. SAMPSON. "Ye'11 never get a
saddle to stay on Vi'let or Duke; besides, they 're wanted for
ploughin'. An' Bob 'ud never carry ye."
"Well, Chrissy 'ud do right enough. He was a fine mare in
his day. I never see a better. There isn't a colt as I "vo a-had
from 'en as haven't turned out well. E'es TOM mid drive 'en
up from the lower mead to-morrow morn, an' we '11 rub 'en down
a. bit and make 'en smart."
"But ye'11 never go for to ride all the way, Granfer?"
pleaded the anxious wife. "Ye '11 be joggled to pieces, an'
I 'm sure your best trousers won't be flt to bo seen. There's
reason in all things. Ye'd best go in JOYCE'S cart, and tie
Chrissy at back till ye get near the town."
"Ah! I mid do that," he agreed, with unexpected docility.
"I reckon I 'd find it a stiffish job to ride so far without I had
a bit more practice."
The discussion was here interrupted by the entrance of TOM,
POLLY'S husband, but was resumed with even greater energy
after the state of affairs had been explained to him. As he was
short-sighted enough, to express doubt and disapproval, the
entire family fell upon him with one accord and reduced him
to a state of sulky submission.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG RIDERS.
CHAPTER VI. i
PROM letters lately received, I am pleased to note that these
hints are meeting with some little attention in the world of
young riders, but there seems, unfortunately, to be a slight
misconception as to their scope and intention on the part of
some of my correspondents. Here, ifor instance, is one—he
veils agood sound sporting name behind the modest pseudonym,
'' An Inquirer ''—who asks me: (1), to recommend a bookmaker
and a breeches-maker; (2), to inform him what, in my opinion,
is the best drink to takeout ill his flask; (3), to advise him as to
the proper treatment of aore backs, splints, and corns; and
(4), to say what I consider the best type of horse for a certain
kind of country •which he describes. These matters, my dear
Sir, are not for me. This treatise has nothing to do—except
quite incidentally, of course—with the points you name. I am
ready to tell you how to talk and generally how to bear yourself
in the hunting field, but there I stop. I flutter about the out-
side of things in a light and frivolous manner; I do not seek to
penetrate into the temple or to tamper with the sacred
mysteries revealed by Captain HAYES or Mrs. NANNY POWER
O'DoNOGHCE. Let others tell you how to judge a horse, how to
ride, how to dress, and what shops you should honour with your
custom. My ambition does not extend to these matters, and all
I can do for you is to school your tongue.
Another letter concerns me more nearly: "Sir," says the
writer, "in your interesting hints you have not, so far, touched
a subject which you will, I think, admit to be one of the very
highest importance to men who hunt. It is this: How, and
under what circumstances, ought one to speak to a Master ol
Hounds? I 've seen a great many fellows do it in different ways
but none of them seemed to me to be quite satisfactory, for in
our hunt there happens to be a sort of feeling that a man has
got to be kept in his proper place, and if he pushes too much he
gets himself snubbed—which is fun for the cat and ought to be
death for the mouse, if the mouse would only agree to look at il
in that way. Anyhow, please give me a tip or two, and oblige
yours, as ever, The Stall at the Top."
This is a sensible letter and shows a prndent spirit. To answer
it fully, however, would need considerable volume, which shoulc
investigate the origin and history of hunts and their masters
from the earliest ages down to the present. It should begin,
let us suppose, by describing how the ancient Briton, having
discovered that his flocks were menaced, told his wife not to
worry, embraced his clamouring brood and assured them that
the fur-coated fox should be disposed of in a twinkling. Next he
would send a polite message to BOADICEA to inform her, owing to
urgent private affairs he would be unable to give himself the
pleasure of taking part in a projected foray upon a friendly anc
unsuspecting tribe of neighbours, or of helping to decimate
a Roman legion. Then I can see him overlaying with a fresh
coat of scarlet paint his customary household garment of woad,
selecting his sharpest javelins and his deadliest bow and sally-
ing forth to extirpate the hostile wolf. This man, in course of
time, would acquire the spirit of the chase. He would cease to
look upon hunting as being merely intended to safeguard
his flocks or his children. He would refuse to allow the
marauding wolf to be slain except upon certain days duly
appointed for the carrying out of the ceremony, and under
certain formal conditions agreed upon by himself and his
followers. These conditions he would then call Sport—the
ancient British word escapes me at the moment—and he would
attribute to it that sacred character of tribal importance which
it has ever since maintained. His neighbours, recognising in
him a chief of sportsmen, would invest him with the ceremonia
leadership, granting to him amongst other privileges an annua
tribute of corn and cattle to recompense him for the time anc
trouble spent in their service. He would feed his hounds, h is
servants and himself at their expense so long as he was engaged
n ministering to their pleasures, and would eventually be
'ollowed to his grave on Salisbury Plain by the sorrow and
respect of the whole country-side. Here you have, sketched
n brief, the first part of a historical work which has yet to be
written. Some day a Professor FREEMAN will arise amongst
hunting men and write it, but in the meantime we are reduced
« paltry actualities, and must refrain from want of knowledge
from more extended historical investigations.
I come back, then, to the question of'addressing masters of
hounds. The master is, if I may so describe him, the President
of the most democratic republic in the world. He is elected to
ttis great position by the suffrages of his equals, who have not
:he remotest intention of making him a ruler without power or
privilege. They intend him to be, during his term of office, a strong
autocrat, governing without fear or favour the sport -which they
consider to be the most important part of human life and
activity. Amongst the innumerable things which, as we
boast, have made Englishmen what they are; hunting as-
suredly stands pre-eminent—and not without reason. Courage
and skill, grace, strength, activity and endurance, a gallant
spirit, a knowledge of the country, a courteous consideration
for others, together with a resolute determination to excel
by all honourable means, a design to taste the exhilaration of
perfect health in the open air and inswift movement, acomplete
control of and sympathy with your horse. These are some of
the qualities that the sport of hunting requires and en-
courages in ite votaries. Obviously, then, the man who is
appointed to be the chief and the master of such a sport is,
in virtue of his appointment, if in virtue of nothing else,
entitled to a high respect and consideration.

DRURIOLENO AND CO.
SINCE 1897, when Messrs. DAN LENO and HERBERT CAMPBELL
disported themselves as The Babes in the Wood, Manager
ARTHUR COLLINS has not given so excellent a pantomime as
this present one, written by himself and Mr. HICKORY WOOD,
viz., The Sleeping Beauty and the Beast. More gorgeous displays
there may, perhaps, have been, but nothing, since aforesaid
Babes to beat this in opportunities afforded to those masters
in drollery, DAN and HERBERT (why shouldn't it be "BERTIE,"
if DANIEL be familiarised as "DAN " ?), for the display of their
apparently utterly irresponsible and quite irresistible fun,
which sends a crowded house into convulsions of uncontrollable
laughter. As for the children among the audience, they shout
and shriek with delight, leading the tumultuous applause.
DAN and BERTIE in a motor car, on a ladder "burgling,
playing golf, are immense. Then DAN alone, as Queen Ravla in
prison, telling the audience the story of her Aunt, moves his
hearers to such tears of laughter that, though utterly exhausted
they would hear the whole narrative over again, including the
criticism on " the Minstrel Boy," signifying the same to DAN
by a perfect volley of applause at the conclusion of bis soliloquy.
If the pantomime consisted of these scenes alone it would be
first-rate value for money, but it has such scenery, such artistic
and brilliant costumes, such poetic groupings, graceful dances
and such catehingly tuneful and cleverly arranged music by

that experienced light and leading composer, selector, arranger,
and orchestra-conductor, J. M. GLOVER, that we can only
wonder at the dazzling combinations and permutations, and,
like the Admiral in Billy Taylor, " werry much applaud " what
all the united efforts of various talented persons have con-
tributed towards the now assured success of this Drury Lane
Pantomime.
Mr. FRED EMNEY as The Nurse is the third "droll" who,
already a favourite, keeps his hold on the audience throughout.
Certain allusions, in the scenes wherein clever Mr. CAIRO
appears as President of a Republic, might be advantageously
omitted, as indeed might be all the topical "hits," which are
rarely of such a kind as not offend some who are present, without
causing much pleasure to others.
The Princess Beauty, Miss MADGE LESSING, obtains a treble
encore when, attired as a boy, she sings a quaint "coon
song" with chorus. Miss ELAINE RAVENSBERQ is a charming
Prince Caramel and Miss MOLLY LoWELLmust be in everybody's
opinion a perfect exemplar of what any Lord Jocelyn, ought
to be. Once again the spring-heeled, airy, fairy Lilian-lady,
Madame GRIGOLATI, "wires in" most successfully as The
Spirit of the Aii- (Mr. GLOVER giving us the spirit of all the airs
in the orchestra), and "comes off," and on, "with flying
colours."
But, after all said, sung and done, we return to our DAN and
BERTIE; for " men may come and men may go," but with these
two leaders of the Drurylanianforces (though BERTIE wouldn't be
quite at home without DAN, and they mustn't be separated) this
pantomime, like the stream, could " run on for ever " if it were
not for the "statutory limitations" in between.
As to " tho houses in between" this and Easter, Manager
COLLINS can regard them without the least anxiety. Mr.
ARTHUR COLUXS gives a lot, too much perhaps, for the money,
as the pantomime is too long, and "There's no deniging of it,
BETSY!"

THE young Englishman sank down on the sofa in tho con-

fixing his melancholy gaze upon the merry eyes of his partner,
addressed her.
"I am glad to get away from the ball-room," he murmured.
"You are quite sure you understand me?"
"Oh, yes; I speak perfectly the English," was the smiling
response.
"Parce qiie je parle parfaitement le Franyaia," he continued;
"but, of course, I am more at home in my own tongue."
"And what do you want know?" queried the fair girl, playing
with her fan.
"You are fond of dress?"
"Pond! I dote upon it! Oh, I love it!"
"Then you have extravagant tastes—vous avez un gout qui
cofite cheref"
"Oh, no; not at all. I know where to get my gowns in the
market of the cheapest. I go to places—shops—where I buy
for nothing, scarcely anything at all."
"Can you give me the address?" he asked, taking out his
note-book.
"You are too kind, you are too good. But the trousseau is
provided by the bride's family, "and she cast down her eyes in
some confusion.
"The addresses," he pleaded. Then the pencil went gliding
over the paper, and the note-book was replaced in the young
man's pocket. "I must go now. Adieu."
They parted. Then the fair young Frenchwoman sighed. He
had not proposed! What a strange sort of Englishman!
But she was wrong. He was not a strange sort of Eng-
lishman, but only a British commercial traveller on the model
suggested by Lord ROSEBERY.

LOVE'S LITTLE LIABILITIES.
SJiort Stories with very Sad Endings.
I.—THE MYSTERY OF MAURICE PINION.
"WITH a beautiful unconventionality that
so strongly appealed to the sensitive
nature of MAURICE PINION he had been
permitted to drift, as it wore, into the
affections of SYBE,HOYLAKE. There was no
more tacit engagement ever formed. Each
had borrowed a phrase from scholastic
Euclid, and said, "Let it be granted."
But the moment had come ta establish
the reciprocity of love on what is termed
in commercial circles a sound and definite
basis. Mr. PINION had suddenly appeared
on the horizon of SYBIL'S life and walked
straight into her young heart, with the
solemn inevitableness of a wind- borne
cloud. Who he was, what he was, were
alike matters of conjecture.
They reclined rather than sat in the
two corners of a Chesterfield sofa. Each
cherished an inward conviction that the
course of true love was going to be
dammed by unkind circumstance.
The man leant a little forward as he
spoke. "SYBIL," he said, rather hesi-
tatingly at first, but gathering force as
he went on, "for nearly six months we
haved lived under the spell of love's
young dream. The awakening must come.
I need not repeat what I have said a
thousand times in a thousand different
ways—I love you."
The girl shivered nervously.
"Before I ask you the great momentous
question, you must learn who I am—what
I am." The man faltered.
"I can trust you," said the girl softly.
"It helps me to go on," said MAURICE
PINION, "as the knowledge of your price-
less love and sympathy has led me to hope
that when I have revealed to you the
secret of my life—you—you will not turn
against mo as so many have done."
SYBIL raised her eyes tenderly towards
his.
"You—you are n-not a convict, a
"Notexactly," said PINION. "But
"Ah! You have perpetrated some
monstrous crime!"
"No, no. I'm guiltless of any crime
within the meaning of the act."
"Thank Heaven, thank Heaven !" she
gasped, her breath coming in the pre-
scribed thick condition under the terrible
stress. "Do not tell me you are a Company
Promoter!"
"No," he answered sadly, "no such
luck."
"Or a long-firm swindler."
"Indeed, no."
"Ora faith curate—I mean cnrist."
"Faith!" MAI:RICE PINION uttered the
•word significantly, and paused in an atti
tade of defiance.
The girl groaned, and hid her face in the
bine-veined fingers with which nature hae
blessed her—for that purpose.
"Listen," cried PINION, rising and pacing
he room rapidly. "It all began by my
sending a little thing to one of the
magazines. I meant nothing by it; in-
deed, I meant nothing."
"Horrible, horrible !" moaned SIBYL.
"It was accepted."
"Naturally. These advertisements"
"You don't understand. It was not an
advertisement."
'Not an advertisement I"
'I sent another. The same result.
Accepted." The man laughed ironically.
"I only thought then of the encourage-
ment with courtesy, and a cheque"

book dropped back into his pocket. The
door closed softly behind him.

DRAMATIC SEQUELS.
IV,—MORE ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
SCENE.—The garden of BENEDICK'S house
at Padua. BENEDICK -is sitting on a
garden seat, sunning himself indo-
lently. BEATRICE is beside him, keep-
ing tip her reputation for conver-
sational brilliancy by a series of
sprightly witticisms.
Beatrice. Very likely I do talk twice as
much as I should. But then, if I talk
too much you certainly listen far too
little, so we arc quits. Do you hear?
Benedick (opening his eyes slowly). Eh?
Beatrice. I believe you were asleep!
But there—'tis a great compliment to
my wit. Like ORPHEUS, I can put even
the savage beasts to sleep with it.
(Benedick's eyes close again, and he ap-
pears to sink into a profound doze.) But
if the beasts go to sleep there 's no use
in being witty. I suppose ORPHEUS never
thought of that. Come, wake up, good
Signior Beast. (Prods him coqnettishly
with her finger.) Have you forgotten that
the Duke is coming? ,
Benedick (drowsily). "When will he be
here?
Beatrice. Ere you have done gaping.
Benedick (terribly bored by this badi-
nage). My dear, if only you would occa-
sionally answer a plain question. When
do you expect him?
Beatrice (skittish to the last). Plain
questions should only be ai -fwered by
plain people.
Benedick (yawning lieartUy). A pretty
question then.
Beatrice. Pretty questions should only
be asked by pretty people. There! What
do you think of that for wit!
Benedick. Really, my dear, I can hardly
trust myself to characterise it in—er—
fitting terms. (Kings bell. Enter Page.}
When is the Duke expected?
Page. In half-an-hour, Sir.
Benedick. Thank you. [Exit Page.
Beatrice (pouting). You needn't have
rung. I could have told you that.
Benedick. I am sure you could, my
dear. But as you wouldn't
Beatrice. I was going to, if you hac
given me time.
Benedick. Experience has taught me
my dear BEATRICE, that it is usually much
quicker to ring! (Closes his eyes again.)
Beatrice. How rude you are!
Benedick (half opening them). Eh?
Beatrice. I said it was very rude of you
to go to sleep when I am talking.
Benedick (closing his eyes afresh). It "s
perfectly absurd of you to talk ;when I
am going to sleep.
Beatrice (girding herself for fresh witti-
cisms). Why absurd?
Benedick. Because I don't hear whai
you say, of course, my love.
Beatrice (whose repartees have been scat
ered for the moment by t/tis adroit com-
pliment). Well, well, sleep your fill, Bear.
'11 go and bandy epigrams with Ursula.
[E.vit BEATRICE. BENEDICK looks cau-
tiously round to see if she in really
gone, and then heaves a sigh of
relief.
Benedick. Poor BEATRICE! If only she
were not so incorrigibly sprightly. She
)ositively drives one to subterfuge.
[Produces a boofc fromhis pocket, which
he reads with every appearance of
being entirely awake.
Enter DON PEDRO, as from a journey.
BENEDICK does not see him.
Don Pedro. Signior BENKDICK!
Benedick (starting up on hearing his
icime). Ah, my dear Lord. Welcome to
Padua.
Don Pedro (Zoofcs him up and down).
3ut how 's this? You look but poorly, my
;ood BENEDICK.
Benedick. I am passing well, my Lord.
Don Pedro. And your wife, the fair
BEATRICE? As witty as ever?
Benedick (grimly). Quite!
Don P. (rubbing his Jtands). I felt sure of
t! I made the match, remember! I said
bo old LEONATO "She were an excellent
match for BENEDICK" as soon as I saw
tier.
Benedick (sighing). So you did, so you
did.
Don P. (puzzled). I 'm bound to say you
don't seem particularly happy.
Benedick (evasively). Oh, we get on well
enough.
Don P. Well enough I Why, what's the
matter, man? Come, be frank with me.
Benedick (impressively). My dear Lord,
never marry a witty wife 1 If you do,
you'll repent it. But it's a painful
subject. Let's talk of something else.
How's CLAUDIO? I thought we should
see him—and HERO—with you.
Don P. (looking slightly uncomfortable).
CLAUDIO is—er—fairly well.
Benedick. Why, what's the matter with
him? His wife isn't developing into a
wit, is she?
Don P. No. She's certainly not doing
that/
Benedick. Happy CLAUDIO! But why
aren't they here then?
Don P. (coughing nervously). Well, the
truth is CLAUDIO'S marriage hasn't been
exactly one of my successes. You remem-
ber I made that match too?
Benedicfc. I remember. Don't they bil
it off?
Don P. (querulously). It was all CLAU-
DIO'S suspicious temper. He never would
disabuse his mind of the idea that HERO
was making love to somebody else. You
remember he began that even before he
was married. First it was me he sus-
pected. Then it was the mysterious man
under her balcony.
Benedick. You suspected him too.
Don P. That 'si true. But that wasi'al
my brother JOHN'S fault. Anyhow, I
houglit when they were onoo married
liings would settle down comfortably.
Benedick. You wero curiously sanguine.
'. should have thought anyone would have
seen that after that scene in the church
/hey would never be happy together.
Den P. Perhaps so. Anyhow, they
weren't. Of course, everything was
against them. What with my brother
fOHN'S absolute genius for hatching plots,
and my utter inability to detect them,
not to speak of CLAUDIO'S unfortunate
Dropensity for overhearing conversations
and misunderstanding them, the intervals
of harmony between them were extremely
few, and, at last, HERO lost patience and
divorced him.
Benedick. So bad as that? How did it
tiappen?
Don P. Oh, in the old way. My brother
pretended that HERO was unfaithful, and
as he could produce no evidence of the
fact whatever, of course CLAUDIO believed
him. So, with his old passion for making
scenes, he selected the moment when I
and half-a-dozen others were staying at
the house and denounced her before us
all after dinner.
Benedicfc. The church scene over again?
Don P. No. It took place in the
drawing-room. HERO behaved with her
usual dignity, declined to discuss CLAC-
DIO'S accusations altogether, put the
matter in the hands of her solicitor, and
the decree'.was made absolute last week.
Benedicfc. She was perfectly innocent,
of course?
Don P. Completely. It was merely
another ruse on the part of my amiable
brother. Really, JOHN'S behaviour was
inexcusable.
Benedicfc. Was CLAUDIO greatly dis-
tressed when he found how he had been
deceived?
Don P. He was distracted. But HERO
declined to have anything more to do
with him. She said she could forgive a
man for making a fool of himself once, but
twice was too much of a good thing.
Benedick (frowning). That sounds rather
more epigrammatic than a really nice
wife's remarks should be.
Don P. She had great provocation.
Benedicfc. That's true. And one can
see her point of view. It was the pub-
licity of the thing that galled her, no
doubt. But poor CLAUDIO had no re-
ticence whatever. That scene in the
church was in the worst possible taste.
But I forgot. You had a share in that.
Don P. (stiffly). I don't think we need
go into that question.
Benedick. And now to select the hour,
after a dinner party, for taxing his wife
with infidelity 1 How like CLAUDIO!
Really, he must been an absolute fool.
Don P. Oh, well, your marriage doesn't
seem to have been a conspicuous success,
if you come to that.

Benedick (sauagely). That's no great
credit to you, is it? You made the match.
You said as much a moment ago.
Don P. I know, I know. But seriously,
my dear BENEDICK, what is wrong?
Benedick (snappishly). BEATRICE, of
course. You don't suppose I 'm wrong,
do you?
Don P. Come, that's better. A spark
of the old BENEDICK. Let me call your
wife to you, and we '11 have one of your
old encounters of wit.
Benedick (seriously alarmed). For
Heaven's sake, no. Ah, my dear Lord,
if you only knew how weary I am of wit,
especially BEATRICE'S wit.
Don P. You surprise me. I remember
I thought her a most amusing young
lady.
Benedick (tersely). You weren't married
to her.
Don P. But what is it you complain of?
Benedick. BEATRICE bores me. It is all
very well to listen to sparkling sallies for
ten minutes or so, but BEATRICE sparkles
for hours together. Sho is utterly in-
capable of answering the simplest question
without a blaze of epigram. When I ask
her what time it is, she becomes so in-
sufferably facetious that all the clocks
stop in disgust. And once when I was
thoughtless enough to enquire what there
was for dinner, she made so many jokes on
the subject that I had to go down without
her. And even then the soup was cold!
Don P. (quoting). "Here you may see
BENEDICK, the married man!"
Benedick. Don't yon try to bo funny too!
One joker in a household is quite enough,
I can tell you. And poor BEATRICE'S jokes
aren't always in the best of taste either.
The other day, when the Vicar came to
lunch ho was so shocked at her that he
left before the meal was half over and his
wife has never called since.
Don P. My poor BENEDICK, I wish I
could advise you. But I really don't
know what to suggest. My brother could
have helped you, I 'm sure. He was
always so good at intrigue. But un-
fortunately I had him executed after his
last exploit with CLAUDIO. It's most un-
lucky. But that's the worst of making
away with a villain. You never know
when you may need him. Poor JOHN could
always be depended upon in an emergency
of this kind.
Benedick (gloomily). He is certainly a
great loss.
DOHI P. Don't you think you could
arrange so that BEATRICE should overhear
you making love to someone else? We've
tried that sort of thing moro than once in
this play.
Benedick (acidly). As the result has
invariably been disastrous, I think we
may dismiss that expedient from our
minds. No, there's nothing for it but to
put up with the infliction, and by practis-
ing a habit of mental abstraction, reduce
the evil to within bearable limits.
Don P. I don't think I quite follow
you.
Benedick. In plain English, my dear
Lord, I find the only way to go on living
with BEATRICE is never to listen to
her. As soon as she begins to be witty
I fall into a kind of swoon, and in that
comatose condition I can live through
perfect coruscations of brilliancy without
inconvenience.
Don P. Does she like that?
Benedick. Candidly, I don't think she
does.
Don P. Hold! I have an idea.
Benedick (nervously). I hope not. Your
ideas have been singularly unfortunate
hitherto in my affairs.
Don. P. Ah, but you'll approve of this.
Benedick. What is it?
Don P. Leave your wife, and come away
with me.
Benedick (doubtfully). She 'd come after
us.
Don P. Yes, but we should have the
start. »
Benedick. That's true. By Jove, I'll
doit! Let's go at once. [Rises liastily.

Don P. I think you ought to leave some
kind of message for her—just to say good-
bye; you know. It seems morejpolite.
Benedick. Perhaps so. (Tears leaf out of
pocket-book). What shall it be, prose or
verse? I remember CLAUDIO burst into
poetry when he was taking leave of HERO.
Such bad poetry too!
Don P. I think you might make it verse
—as you're leaving her for ever. It
seems more in keeping with the solemnity
of the occasion.
Benedick. So it does. (Writes.)
Bored to death by BEATRICE'S tongue
Was the hero that lived here
Don P. Hush! Isn't that your wife over
there in the arbour?
Benedick (losingihis temper). Dash it all1!
there's nothing but eaves-dropping in this
play.
Don P. Perhaps* she doesn't' see us.
Let's steal off, anyhow, on the chance.
[They creep off on tip toe (R) as
BEATRICE enters with similar
caution (L).
Beatrice (watching them go). Bother! I
thought I should overhear what they were
saying. I believe BENEDICK, is really run-
ning away. It's just as well. If he
hadn't, I should. He had really grown too
dull for anything. (Sees note which BENE-
DICK lias left) Ah, so he 's left a message.
"Farewell forever," I suppose. (Heads it.
Stamps her foot) Monster! If I ever
see him again I '11 scratch him!

AN APOLOGY.
[" At the 0. P. Club dinner, the chairman, Mr.
CECIL RALEIGH, repeated his well-known views as
to SHAKSPEARE as a dramatic ' blackleg' who was
a grossly uufair competitor in the market. Speak-
ing of Mr. TBEE, he said that as a manager he had
given London a most remarkable series of plays,
with only occasionally regrettable lapses into
SHAKSPEAEE. "—Daily Chronicle.]
Shade of Sliakspeare speaks:
WHAT 's this I hear? New charges swell
In ever, ever blackening lists.
A blackleg I, that undersell
Legitimate trades-unionists,
And so reduce to next to zero
Profits of GRUNDY, JONES, PINERO?
Ye modern masters of an art
Wherein a humble 'prentice I,
I, Sirs, have played no pushful part
Nor sought a cheap publicity:
If I am acted, blame not me,
But Messrs. BENSON, WALLER, TREE.
I know my place. Nor would I claim
A rank to which I cannot rise;
My work I would not think to name
Beside The Wisdom of the Wise:
What is the coarse and clumsy wit
Of my poor clowns compared with it?
My simple Muse made no pretence
Of more ambitious problem play;
I wrote no Mrs. Dane's Defence
Nor Second Airs. Tanqueray;
Such masterpieces find no rivals
Among niy out-of-date survivals.
My lyrics have been praised, I 'in told;
I know them dross, a base alloy
Beside the pure refined gold
Of Geisha, Circus Girl, San Toy,
And humbly bows my Muse before a
Great work of art like Florodora.
True, one there is to whom some say
A faint resemblance I can boast;
More kind than critical are they
That would so honour this poor ghost,
And fondly claim to have him reckoned
To that great mind a distant second.
Great mind—so great that my poor claim
To sire this prodigy of TREE'S
Has fired the emulative flame
Of easy-going SOPHOCLES
To challenge my pretence and find
The prototype in his own mind.
And he who once would not contest
With JiscHYLUS, but kissed him—lo!
IIo argues with a fiery zest
Till Hades rings again as though
EURIPIDES, the metre blunderer
Did wrangle with the mighty Thunderer.

OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT is curious to read in Captain CAIRNE'S history of Lord
Roberts as a Soldier in Peace and War (HODDER AND STOUGHTON),
that the veteran soldier who has returned unscathed from an
arduous campaign to gallantly face the subtler perils of a
succession of ban-
quota was a deli-
cate youth. Up to
his eighteenth
year, wo are told,
he was not only
small (he has
scarcely yet got
over that), but
suffered from re-
current attacks of
faintness, behind
which heart dis-
ea.se was sus-
pected. His par-
ents were in doubt
as to whether it
was safe for him
to sojourn in a
tropical climate.
But BOBS had uiado
up his mind to be
a soldier as his
father was, and in
February, 1852,
set out for India,
modestly bearing
a commission as
Lieutenant in the
Bengal Artillery,
then in the service
of the East India
Company. Captain
CAIRNES is at the
disadvantage of
appearing in the
field after Lord
ROBERTS filled it
with his own fas-
cinating account
of what he did and
saw during his
forty-one years' re-
sidence in India.
Per contra, he has the opportunity of bringing into fuller
light some episodes Lord ROBERTS'S modesty tended to ob-
scure. On the whole, my Baronite finds in the volume an
excellent record of a stirring career. In his advance on
Cabul, in his even more famous march to Kaudahar, is seen
the same alert, capable, when the moment comes, audacious
Captain known in nearer times in South Africa. In the earlier
stages of his service Lord ROBERTS was, as he has shown
himself in later times, tireless in his care for the well-being
of the private soldier under his command. In India as in
South Africa, foot and horseman, they all love BOBS.
In Number One and Number Two (MACMILLAN & Co.) "P. M.
PKARD" — that is, not Field-Marshal" but FRANCES MARY,
PEAJUJ (whether "Mrs. or Miss " this Deponent, i.e., the Baron,
knoweth not)—has given us a simple, but thoroughly interest-
ing story, always brightly, and, in many instances, brilliantly
•written. Truly, in literature, an exquisite art is simplicity!
The scene being laid in Egypt, the authoress had given herself
every chance of filling her pages with artistic descriptions of
a vivid Eastern character. "But in spite of all temptations"

'J'Ni7 "SEE THAT BIRD?*
FRANCES MARY has never strayed away from the straight path
of narration, and whenever it leads her through picturesque
places at witching times sho has, with perfect touch, briefly
and graphically described these scenes after the manner of
one to whom the peculiarities of Eastern travel and its weird
beauties are quite familiar. It is the best novel of dramatic
dialogue the Baron
has read for some
time. The only
situation of any-
thing like a sen-
sational character
seems to have been
decided upon by
the clever a u-
thoress in a hurry.
She wanted to jerk
her two estranged
lovers together, to
throw them forci-
bly into one an-
other's arms, and
how could this end
be better attained
than by the sud-
den appearance
on the scene of a
r u n a way horse
"urging on his
wild career," and,
en passant, kicking
the hero, who has
saved the heroine,
into the latter's em-
brace! 'Tis ending
a comedy of real
life with a "turn"
in a circus. This
blot is irritating
only because all
the rest .is so par-
ticularly good. Up
to this stage, and
immediately after
it, when the mis-
chief is done,
"'tis all FRANCES
MARY," in stalls,
boxes, and dress
circle, but this
situation is decidedly "Fanny Polly," in gallery, "upper
suckle," and pit. THE BARON DK B. W.
THE LESS THE CASH, THE MORE THE COURAGE.
(A story for the incredulous.)
TIIR hero stood ready to attempt the forlorn hope. Hitherto,
he had not been particularly distinguished for his courage.
Ho had been sparing in his stock of ammunition. Over and
over again, when he might have used his revolver to advantage,
he had been supine.
"And you have decided to cover yourself with glory?"
asked his subaltern.
"Yes; glory is better than a threadbare coat?"
"And you have no cartridges?"
"No," replied the hero, bitterly. "I cannot afford toget any."
"My friend," said the subaltern. "This is the supremo
moment. "Why, my dear friend, are you courting certain death ?''
"Because, to tell you the truth," calmly replied the hero,
'' on my wretched pay I cannot afford to live!''

THE NOBLE CAME.
(A vision of the near
future.)
WITH great as-
to nishment the
Veteran Cricketer
read in. his daily
paper that his old
county, Loamshire,
was engaged in a
three days' match
with Little Puddle-
ton. What in the
world was tho
meaning of the fact
that one of the
finest elevens in
England was play-
ing against a vil-
lage team? Deter-
mined to get to the
bottom of the
mystery, he rushed
off to the County
ground, sat down
in the enclosure,
and put his ques-
tion to the spec-
tator occupying
the next chair.
"Why;" said tho
spectator, "itwill
take us all our time
to beat Little
Piiddlcton nowa-
days. Look at the
telegraph —
they 've got 800
for one wicket
already."
The Veteran
Cricketer, how-
ever, was watch-
ing the play in-
tently. "But, good
Heavens, look at
the bowling!" ho
exclaimed. "Who
on earth is that
man sending down
underhand full-
pitches to leg?
What's become of
where 's TWISTER?
our usual bowlers 1"
The stranger smiled compassionately.
"You seem unaware, Sir," he said, "that
the county captains have held a meeting
since the close of last season, and the
result is that tho game is considerably
altered. Two witnesses deposed that they
had seen SCATTERBAIL, when a boy of ten,
deliver an unfair ball. Once a thrower,
always a thrower, is the captains' maxim.
Consequently, SCATTERBAIL is forbidden
to play."
"But how about TWISTER?" enquired
tho Veteran Cricketer. "No one in Eng-
land has a fairer delivery than his!"
v'v^"

UNKIND.
Tite Bolilits hired a turn-out for a drive into the country, and Mrs, B. drove.
Mr. B. "I UNDBRHTOOD YOU TO SAY, M.MLIA, THAT YOU KNEW HOW TO DRIVE!"
SCATTERBAIL? And
I don't sec one of
"Quito so," assented the other.
"TWISTER'S delivery has been perfectly
fair—up to the present. But, as the cap-
tains argued, what guarantee is there
that, if he were still permitted to play, he
might not take to throwing in the future?
Practically none. So, as TWISTER had taken
many of their wickets last season, and it

was impossible to
say that he might
not some day send
down a ball of
doubtful fairness,
they have forbid-
den him to take
part in this year's
cricket. On the
same principle,
they have warned
off all our other
bowlers."
"How perfectly
preposterous!"
cried the Veteran
Cricketer. "But
—there 's another
bye 1 That's the
sixth this over.
Who is keeping
wicket 1 Anyhow,
they can't have
warned off poor old
SNAPPER for unfair
bowling—he never
bowled iu his
life!"
"No," the
8 t r a nger ox-
plained, "but one
of the captains de-
clared he had once
lost his wicket
through SNAPPER'S
happening to
sneeze when he
was just about to
play a difficult ball.
Determined to
stamp out the
slightest suspiciou
of unfairness, the
captains agreed
that SNAPPER must
not keep wicket
for the future iu
any county
match."
"So the whole
team is changed,
except tho cap-
tain !'' tho Veteran
Cricketer remarked. "Stay, though—I
see one familiar face—that's NIMBLE, sure
enough. But why on earth is the smartest
cover-point in the world put to field at
deep long-on?"
"He was too smart," rejoined the other.
"Such exceptional agility was thought
likely to disconcert the batsman, which
would bo obviously unfair. Therefore,
the county captains"
"Rubbish! Nonsense!" interrupted
the Veteran Cricketer. "Preposterous
tomfoolery! County captains, indeed!
What is the M.C.C. doing?"
His companion smiled. "That," he
said, "is what a good many people are
asking." A. C. D.

THE QUEEN.
"TT ERE, in an early number of his life's work, Mr. -Punch,
by the hand of one of his Young Men, first presents
his QUBEN to her faithful people. Apart from this incident
the occasion is historic. At the date HER MAJESTY had been
married just eighteen months. A political crisis, followed
by a General Election, deprived her of the counsel and com-
panionship of her friend and first Minister of State, Lord
MELBOURNE. Sir ROBERT PEEL was inevitable, and was re-
luctantly sent for.
"The position of affairs and the attitude of parties is accu-
rately shown by the artist. The QUEEN is seated at her
desk, over which is shown a bust of the lamented MELBOURNE.
With face averted from the intruder, HER MAJESTY reluc-
tantly opens his letter of introduction, which comes in the
form of a mandate from the electorate, giving the Tories
(at this epoch there were no Conservatives) an overwhelming
majority."

“What England suffered in those days of suspense only those who lived through them can realise. In this fine picture we see the Queen making common cause with her people, widowed and made
fatherless at Delhi, Lucknow, and Cawnpore. At the time of the issue of this number the latest news in London was that Delhi was still in the hands of the rebels, and that the Presidency at Lucknow was
besieged. Asamatter of fact, the Queen's prayer had already been answered. Delhi had been captured by 'steel-hearted British soldiers,' and ‘the God of Battles' had led Havelock to the relief of Lucknow.”

THE tears we disallow to lesser ill
Here is no shame for English eyes to shed,
Because the noblest heart of all is still —
Because the QUEEN lies dead.
Grief asks for words, yet silent grief were well;
Vain is desire, as passionate prayer was vain;
Not all our love can bring, by any spell,
Breath to those lips again.
Ah I had but Death foregone his'royal claim,
Demanding ransom, life for life the price,
How loyalty had leaped to kiss the flame
Of such a sacrifice!
God knows, in many a need this thing has been —
Light hearts for her have dared the desolate grave;
From other hurt their blood has saved the QCEEN,
From Death it could not save. /
And of the dregs to drink from sorrow's cup
This is most bitter, that with life's release
She might not leave her children folded up
Between the wings of Peace.
Yet, for a solace in that darkest hour,
When even Kings have found themselves alone,
Over a people's love she kept her power
Firm as her fathers' throne.
So by the gate where is no first nor last
And lords of earth must lay their splendour down,
Thither, where Love is Sovereign, she has passed
To win his queenlier crown.
Thence, by her guardian spirit, heavenly-wise,
Still shall her realm of old be girded round,
And common loss yet closer knit the ties
That common love has bound.
Yea, too, since Nature owns no bar of race,
She, being dead, may speak through alien lands,
Changing suspicion, by remembered grace,
To trust that understands.
O great of heart! in whom the world has known
'Wisdom with woman's sweetness reconciled;
Who held her Kingdom's honour, as her own,
Still fair and undented!
Best shall they keep that stainless memory bright
Who count their heritage a holy debt,.
Who walk with fearless soul the way of light
In which her feet were set.
And in that faith, ere yet our tears are dry,
Or poignant grief has spent its sudden sting,
To Him she serves we lift our hearts and cry,
"God save her son, the King I" O. S.

THE LEVEE OF THE SEASON. 1874.
“In March, 1874, the victorious troops came back from Ashantee. The climax of enthusiasm was reached when the Queen reviewed the troops in the Great Park at Windsor. They were only 1,600 strong,
: mere group compared with the armies of the Continent. But they chanced, as is shown in the picture, to be representative of all the nationalities, both branches of the service, and some of the most
amous regiments.”

'THE QUEEN! THE QUEEN!"
""CpOR the last time in her long reign the QUEEN opened Parlia-
ment in person in the Session of 1886. It was a final mark
of favour to the heritors <>i M r. DISRAELI'S power, and was the
more marked by reason of the absolute hopelessness of the
situation. "The Stop-Gap Government," as Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
•wittily called it when, in* June, 1885, an unexpected concatena-
tion of circumstances called it into being, was heavily routed
at the General Election that took place in the following
December. Mr. GLADSTONE, after a brief exile, came back to
power stronger than ever.
"Unlike Mr. DISRAELI in 1880, Lord SALISBURY resolved to
meet Parliament, facing it from the'Ministerial Bench. To this
gallant but hopeless effort the QUEEN lent the encouragement of
her rare presence. It was unavailing against the inevitable.
On January 21 the QUEEN opened Parliament in person, her
•peech being drafted in Lord SALISBURY'S Cabinet."

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Wednesday, January 28rtl.—THE last
time the QUEEN, seated on the Throne in the House of Lords,
opened Parliament in person, -was in January, 1880. The
circumstances of the political hour were as strange as the
QUEEN'S visits to Westminster were rare. Lord SALISBURY was
still Prime Minister, albeit at the general election just con-
cluded he had been hopelessly routed. Possibly it was a
feeling of loyalty to an old friend in time of trouble that
prompted HER MAJESTY to go out of her ordinary way to
associate herself with Ministers whose fall was inevitable.
Within a week of the ceremony, Mr. JESSE COLLINGS moved the
historic amendment to the Address asserting the principle of
endowing the agricultural labourer with three acres and a
cow. On a division the Government were defeated by a
majority of 79, and forthwith resigned. •
By odd coincidence, the precedent appearance of the QUEEN
on the Parliamentary scene presaged ministerial defeat. In
1880 the glamour that had through some years 'steadily shone
over Lord BfiACONSFTELD'S Government was fading. The sands
of the life of the Parliament that in 1874, for the first time in his
career, placed him in power as well as office, were running
out. The shadow of Dissolution hung over all. The only
question was at what hour it would fall. The QUEEN came clown
to give her favourite Minister a good send-off on the perilous, as
it turned oat the fatal, leap awaiting him.
In 1870, the third Session of the Disraolian Parliament,
HER MAJESTY, after long absence, reappeared at West-
minster. It was a stately scene, from which the sun pettishly
withdrew. One remembers, over the wilderness of a quarter of
a cent»ry, the semi-darkness that filled the Chamber, crowded
with Peers and Peeresses awaiting the coming of the QUEEN.
At a signal from the LORD CHANCELLOR a flood of light from the
gaseliers ia the roof suddenly burst on the scene. A chatter
of conversation abruptly filling the Chamber testified to the
revulsion of "spirits consequent on deliverance from the de-
pressing influence of the fog.
This scene DISRAELI witnessed from the Bar of the House,
where he stood breathless after the mad rush of the Com-
mons to get front places in the Heuse of Lords. The ordered
programme was that the SPEAKER should walk in solemn
majesty, led by Black Rod, escorted by the Sergeant^at-Arms.
Behind him, at respectful distance, would pace the Leader
of the House and the Leader of the Opposition. Then come
Ministers, ex-Ministers, and Privy Councillors, whilst sedately
marched in the rear the host of private Members. That
was all very well; looks nice when written down on paper.
But, alack! before Blaei Rod had safely conducted the
SPEAKER within the corridor leading to the Lords' Lobby, the
mass of Members, spreading out in the Octagon Hall, finding
their progress baffled by the narrower limits of the corridor,
began to press forward. The SPEAKER was hustled into the
presence of [his sovereign, safe in possession of wig and gown.
But the feeble body of the PREMIER was sorely tried. It was
said at the time he had been overthrown. That was the usual
exaggeration. He was certainly a good deal knocked about.
The QUEEN opening Parliament again in the following Ses-
sion, DISRAELI took effective means of. preventing recurrence
of accident. When, on the 8th of February, 1877, the QUEEN
took her seat on the Throne, the PREMIER entered the House
by the less tumultuous approach of the doorway behind the
Throne. Nay, he accompanied his SOVEREIGN robed in crimson
and ermine, bearing aloft a sword in scabbard richly dight.
Still BENJAMIN, be was DISRAELI no more, but Earl of BEACONS-
FIELD, carrying the Sword of State before the QUEEN, whom lie
•
had of late made EMPRESS OF INDIA.
In 1886 the QUEEN came to Westminster once more in the
circumstances described. Then fell silence, and now night.
Although in recent times the QUEEN'S direct touch •with
Parliament was limited to these four visits, her interest in
its proceedings was exceedingly keen. It is an old story how
every night the LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS wrote a
letter summarising the course of proceeding at a current
sitting. In view of the variety in Pictures in Parliament pre-
sented by the morning papers, supplementing the lengthened
report of the speeches, that seemed a superfluity. The custom
was in vogue when the QUEEN camo to the Throne, and she
clung to it to the end. It dates back to the time of GEORGE
III., when newspapers were scarce and the reporting of Parlia-
mentary Debates was hampered by hopeless restrictions.
LORD NORTH, First Lord of the Treasury from 1770 to 1782,
wrote " Essence of Parliament" long before it was distilled in
the pages of Punch.
In the course of her long reign, the QUEEN saw Parliamentary
procedure revolutionised. Through moro than sixty years she
gave her royal assent to a scries of Bills which raised the
condition of her people to the highest plane of prosperity and
domestic comfort known among nations. Her counsel has
strengthened the heart, to a certain extent guided the pur-
pose, of a long succession of Ministers. Never once, except
in the so-called Bedchamber Plot, which happened while she
was yet a girl, did she assume an attitude approaching conflict
with political feeling in Parliament. In the House of Commons
the reverence felt for her was testified at the merest mention
of her name. From time to time the Lords and Commons have

'THE WATER BABIES AND THE ROYAL GODMOTHER." 1891.
"On February 26, 1891, Portsmouth Dockyard was in festive array. Two new ships, bolder than anything yet numbered in the fleet, had been
completed. One was the largest battleship up to date built in Great Britain. The Queen consented to honour the occasion by launching and naming the
vetwlu. Accompanied by the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Duke of Connaught, Her Majesty successfully launched the mammoth
•hips, naming one the Soyat Arthur, the other the Boyal Sovereign."

joined in congratulation on some happy event in the family
circle, or in tribute of sorrow and sympathy, blows far too
frequently smote one of the gentlest, most faithful, hearts that
ever beat in the breast of woman. There has been no mistaking
the genuineness of the emotion then evoked.
Memborfi of the last House of Commons, many of whom sit in
that which to-day mourns the death of the QUEEN, do not forget
the characteristic circumstances which last brought them into
her presence. They had gone in a body'to Buckingham Palace,
to present their congratulations on the sixtieth anniversary of
her accession, to the Throne. There was blundering on the
part of officious personages, with result that only a dozen or
a score of members reached the room where the QUEBN awaited
their coming. HER MAJESTY, hearing "of the disappointment
thus occasioned, regardless~of the burden of her years, of the
exceptional work pressed upon her by the Jubilee ceremonies,
arranged a 'special Garden Party at Windsor, where she was
at home to her faithful Commons.
That is tke last glimpse of her that dwells [in the memory
of the majority. It was appropriately homely in its kindness^-
the aged QUEBN, all on a summer afternoon, greeting her
guests in her own home-garden, endeared to her by the varied
memories of sixty years.
*****
Last night, Tuesday, January 22, the QUEKN died.
******
To-day, Wednesday, January 23, the King lives.
Parliament hastily summoned to take the oath of allegiance
to the new Sovereign. Considering abruptness of summons the
muster large, especially in the Commons. Many come on from
St. James's Palace, where they saw the King subscribe the
oath enacted at the Union.
Members not yet Privy Councillors cluster in the Lobby and
wonder by what title they shall hail their King. At Westminster
no one as yet knows. The form of oath is written out ready, all
but the title of his Majesty. Under which King, ALBERT or
EDWARD 1 BKNZONIA GIBBONS, 'Clerk of the Public Bill Office,
•who has the matter in charge, could not speak if for his silence
ho had te die.
The news finally flashes forth in manner the more impressive
because undesigned. Four o'clock having struck and the
Speaker taken the chair, he rises and says: "It now becomes
our duty to take the oath of allegiance to His MAJESTY KING
EDWAKO THE SEVENTH."
A murmur of approval ran round the benches. In the un-
wonted style thus proclaimed there was a fine old Plantagenet
flavour that pleased .the palate of the representatives of an
ancient people.
Boom! Boom! The sullen roar reverberates through West-
minster Hall. It is the long drawn-out plaint of the minute
gun, that takes an hour and twenty-two minutes to spell out
the message The QUEEN is dead.
Business done.—Members take oath of allegiance to new
KINO.
Thursday.—My right honourable friend the Member for Sark
who, with the rest of the Privy Councillors, was at St. James's
Palace yesterday, tells me the KINO, in trying circumstances,
bore himself with dignity, grace, and, at times, a tenderness
that touched all hearts. His reference to his "beloved Mother,
the QUEEN" (he did not speak of her as "the late QUEEN")
was uttered in a broken voice. When he came to pledge him-
self to follow in her footsteps as a Constitutional Sovereign, as
long as there is breath in his body to work for the good of his
people, he braced himself up and spoke in clear emphatic notes.
Business done.—More swearing-in.
Friday.—Find ourselves in odd plight. By Statute incorpo-
rated in Parliamentary Reform scheme of 1867, old state of things
whereby Parliament was straightway dissolved on demise of
Crown abolished. Consequent avoidance of deplorable incon-
venience of General Election, following close on that which in
October celebrated "the close of the war." In the quaint
way in which Bills are drafted, this 30 and 31 Vic. orders by
special section that the act is not to apply to Scotland or
Ireland. Logical consequence is, that whilst we English and
Welsh members go on as if nothing happened at Osborne on
Tuesday night, there must needs be a General Election for
Ireland and Scotland.
"We muddle through a war somehow," as Lord ROSEBERY
hopefully says. How wo are going to muddle through this
business not yet settled. Irish members, at present couchant
in their castled homes, may be counted upon to have something
to say on the matter when they turn up next month. They
will, at least, insist that Scotch members be put to the trouble
and expense of another election.
Business done.—Addresses to the KING conveying condo-
lence and congratulation voted in both Houses. Ai'jonrn till
14th of February. ,

“Eighteen hundred and ninety-seven is the Queen's year, the sixtieth anniversary of a memorable reign. On this the eve of the Queen's birthday
there yet remain months of the year into which great events may be crammed. Up to mid-April it was hoped that strenuous efforts, in which the Queen
has taken an anxious part, would have averted war. That hope suffered sudden extinction, and the Jubilee year has not proved a year of peace on earth
and goodwill among men. England, having done her best for peace' sake, stands apart from the fray. The nation united in preparation for rendering full

Mrs. BULKWLSE, the Colonel'a wife, a
full, broad and asxertiiw lady, is giving
ten to Mrs. LYTTLETOS-CAIITWKKJHT,
with the stump of fashion upon her,
and Mrs. KARMADINE, who has a soul
for art—both {adieu of the regiment,
Colonel BllLKWISE, a stnal{ and de-
sjyondent man wlwxc hair is "part-

Mrs. Bul1ni<i»K (miring a tea cup). As
surely as WOMAN is asserting her right to
a place in medicine, in law, and in the
council, so surely will she take her proper
place in the control of the army.
Mr*. Lyttleton - Cartivright. What a
lovely costume one could compose out of
the uniform. I 'vo often tried JACK'S
tunic on.
Mrs. B. (severely). The mere brutal
work of fighting, the butchery of the
trade, would still have to be left to the
men; but such matters as require higher
intelligence, keener wit, tact, perse-
verance, should be, and some day shall
be, in our hands.
Airs. Kttrmadiite. And the beauty and
grace of life, Mrs. BI:LKWISE. Surely wo
women, if allowed, could in peace bring
ulture to the barrack-room, and garland
the sword with bay wreaths?
rg. B. Take the War Office. I am told
that the ranks of the regiments are de-
pleted of combatant officers in order that
they may sit in offices, in Pall Mall, and
lo clerical work indifferently. Now, I
hold that our sex could do this work
better, more cheaply, and with greater
dispatch.
Airs. L-C. "Pall-Mall" would be such
an excellent address.
Mrs. 13. The young men, both officers
and civilians, who are employed waste,
so I understand, the time of the public by
going out to lunch at clubs and frequently
pause in their work to smoke cigars and
discuss the odds. Now a glass of milk,
or some claret and lemonade, a slice of
seed-cake, or some tartlets, brought by a
maid from'the nearest A. B. C. shop would
satisfy all our mid-day wants.
Mrx. L-C. And I never knew a woman
who couldn't work and talk bonnets at
the same time.
Mrs. C. Just a few palms—don't you
think, Mrs. BULKWISK?—in those dreary,
dreary rooms, and some oriental rugs on
the floors, and a little bunch of flowers on
each desk would make life so much easier
to live.
[Colonel Biillcu'ise murmurs something
unintelligible.
Mrs. B. What do you say, GEORGE?
Colonel B. (with sudden fierceness). I
said, that there are too many old women,
as it is, in the War Office.
Mrs. B. GEORGE!
[The Colonel relapses again into morose
silence.
Mrs. B. The Intelligence Department
should, of course, bo in our hands.
Mr*. L.-C. I should just love to run
about all the time, finding out other
people's secrets.
Airs. B. And the Clothing Department
calls for a woman's knowledge. The
hideous snuff-coloured garments must be
retained for warfare, but with the new
costume for walking out and ceremonial
I think something might be done.
Mrs. L-C. Tho woman who makes my
frocks is as clever as she can be, and
always has her head full of ideas for
those sort of things.
Mm. C. MICHEL ANGELO did not disdain
to design the uniform of the Swiss Guard.
Perhaps GILBERT, or FORD, or BROCK might
follow in the giant's footsteps.
Col. B. You ladies always design such
sensible clothes for yourselves, do you
not? [He is frozen into silence again.
Airs. B. And the education of young
officers. From a cursory glance through
my husband's books on law, topography
and administration, I should say that
there are no military subjects that the
average woman could not master in a
fortnight. Strategy, of course, comes to
us by intuition. Tho companionship and

cannot be overrated, and the professors both at the Staff College

(Continued from January.)
(With the Author's compliments to Mr. Maurice Hewlett.)
10TH TO 18TH.—But of the crowning Moralities of Monsieur
BERNARD LE COQ-SHAW and how he belittled Master SHAKSPEARE
CYONE D'AVON I trust not myself to indite, being simple of
wit and holding such things to be the peculiar of learned
doctors. Hear then an excerpt of GUILLEM SAGITTARIUS, whereof
the judgment ranges from Le Roi (Edipe to Qnex le Qai and
the visions of HENRIK DE L'HOSTEL POUP£E. Over duranimous
of speech he is for a full report; yet a man of conscience and
his matter solid.
"How," says he, "shall I justify me of my Art in the
perpending of these 'Three Plays for Puritans,' short of ex-
hausting a furlong of parchment. Let me consider of one only,
of his 'Csesar and Cleopatra.' And be it known that this
Morality is conceived in a certain naughty spirit of badinage
to which a generous indulgence should be conceded. Yet,
in pure sooth, he overtops the legitimate hedge of licensed
fooling, when ho presents in Britannus (amanuensis to Ctesar)
a persona informed with decadent sentiment and tinged with
latter-day paradox. Vain the contention of Monsieur LE COQ-
SHAW, that the lapse of centuries has but immaterially modi-
fied the British type, as charactered by influence of soil
and climate and other physical environing. Still would I urge
my suspicion (I hope groundless) of divers anachronisms, still
(with deference) allege neglect of right local colour and histori-
cal harmonies." And so forth, much of it.
19TH TO 28RD.—But about this time Sir HOWARD, Lord Duke
of the North-folk, that hitherto had been disposed to cloistral
habitudes, sat mightily in the public eye. For being Chief
Butler of England (by grace of birth) and also Comptroller of
Letter-bags (by grace of sheer desert) he was minded to yield up
this last dignity, the better to expedite him for battle against
the heathen; of so galliard a stock of chivalers was his tree
compact. So in harness of the wan leopard's hue he sailed
south by east. And under a blistering noon, very noxious to
parched maws, he pricking against the enemy (that had no heart
to wait his advent), and crying "Ha! MALTRAVERS! Sauve
ARUNDEL!" his palfrey avoided from under him. But being
recovered of this hurt, he made dedication of his knightly spurs
to Saint MICHAEL of Table Bay, and so home without more ado.
And now you shall hear how he must needs make his peace
with Monsignor the Pope, that had looked askance on this
crusade and withheld blessing from my Lord Duke's emprise.
So in palmer's sable he mado haste to Borne with a great
following of pelegrins, and there he gat himself misliked as
one that was loud to have His Holiness restored to temporal
thrones; and brought the Quirinal about his ears; and so home
again, protesting fair intent.
And as soon as he had done off his pilgrim's weeds, he must go
accoutred cap-a-pie in his panoply of Earl Marshal (likewise by
grace of birth) for proclaiming of the new King. And not a
blazoned herald of them all that could move without his nod.
And it was matter for mere marvel how one mortal could be so
innumerably gifted. But thereafter he withdrew to his privy
pleasaunce of Arundel, and set his face against pride.
24T1I TO 26TH.—Now, as the city waxed monstrous fruitful,
but the highways abode as they were, save for yawning breeches
in the floor thereof very unseasonable, you will collect that
the press of passengers, horse and foot, grew like to a hustle
of pilchards pell-mell in a Brittany drag-net. And the town-
watch gave admonishment, crying "Passavant! passavant!" or
"Halte-la!" as the case demanded. And the driver of the
all-folks-wain would turn to his rearguard and " Lord Mayor ha'
mercy," he would say, "'tis a mazy faring!" And, "Ay, mate,
a bit thick!" his fellow; and so would troll a snatch of Adhccsi
pavimento.
But for relief of the pent roads there was devised a hollow
mine-way, such as coneys affect; and engines, fitted thereto,
to draw men through the midriff of earth, betwixt its crust
and fiery omphalode. And it was named Le Tube a Deux
Deniers; for, fared they never so far,' serf or margrave,
difference of price or person was there none. But against the
Company of Adventurers that wrought the same was plaint made
of flacking walls, and a volleying of roof-beams, and basements
rent as with a mangonel. And "Tush!" says the Company.
But "Oy, sires!" cried the dwellers overhead, " let the chose
be 'jugee!'" And so haled them before the Shire-reeve's
Court, for mulct and amercement.
27TH, 28TH.—Now so it was, that the chivalry of England,
they alone, took shame of being seen abroad in fighting-gear,
whether as being too proud to air the ensigns of their
pride, or for modesty, lest in so salient a flame the hearts of
ladies errant might be as night-moths scorched against their
will—I may conjecture, not determine. But le Sieur Boas DE
KANDAHAR sent word that he would have his knighthood eschew
mufti (an unchristian word, filched, as you should know, from
unblooded law-givers of Byzant) and come before him in
armour point-devise. And this was but as a tucket to prelude
the shock of battle. For my Lord BOBS had laid his baton in
rest against the Empery of Red Tape." And it was no madrigal
business; but a task such as had Duke HERCLES of pleasant
renown when he laid his besom about the middens of the Old
Man of the Stables (Vetus de Stabulis).
29TH TO SlST.—But scarce it wanted a se'nnight to the eve of
Monsirc VALENTINE when the mviere-ban outflow for summons
to a serry of knights at the High Court of Parliament. And of
those that sent it forth Sir BELCHAMP PORTE-DRAPEAU was one;
he that was named Fore-and-Aft by his own; for that he sat
with portions of him overlapping the fence, this way and that
way.
"Saint LLOYD-GEORGE for Little England!" came answer
from the Welsh Marches.
And "Dame!" cried JEHAN OF MONTROSE, that, save under
great provoking, used but sparsely the language of piety;
"and must I quit my inkhorn for yon chattering parrot-house ?''
"Stone of BUFUS !" cried Sir VERNON DE CHASTEL-LA-FOREST,
surnamed Le Pompous for a touch of the mammoth in his
motion; a born trampler of men; "Stone ofBuFi'Sl" says he,
"but I scent budget-work afoot!" And so snorted joyfully.
"Great GLAMIS !" said the Thane of Fife iE. Division), "I am
the Empire's, let her make what wars she will. That first;
then give me Holy Church to harry!"
"King's man!" cried Sir CoP-LA-PoULE; "and sib with you
there, both ways!"
But "By the Mace!" said LA BOUCHERS of the Cordonniers,
"there should be noses broke among the faithful. 'Tis like to
be a most amazing pretty medley." O. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MARTYRDOM OF UNCLE JACK.
EVERYBODY knew that Uncle JACK lived
at the Temple, and nobody knew when or
why he came to live there. It is true
that the Law List mentioned 1870 as the
date of his call to the Bar, but his friends
and acquaintances all felt that this must
be a mistake, for not even his bitterest
enemy ever accused Uncle JACK of being
in the least like a barrister. A legend
was extant that in the good old days
of the "'eighties"—long before London
suffered from the twopenny tubercular
disease—he once received a County Court
brief; but the best of men are not proof
against calumny, and even the legend
contained no suggestion that Uncle JACK
won the case or, indeed, displayed any
acumen whatever in conducting it.
It was only after his martyrdom that he
was universally canonised as Uncle. Of
course he had been an uncle long before,
and in a pretty extensive way; but the
experiences of a few weeks ago turned
the theory into a fact of such dreadful
dimensions that—But I anticipate.
He did not deserve his martyrdom.
Even youthful barrister acquaintances
admitted that, despite certain grave moral
failings laid to his charge. For instance,
it must be reluctantly admitted that he
did not regard KIPLING as the greatest
writer of the age, that he still read
DICKENS, and on one appalling occasion
when token by an enthusiastic Ibsenite to
one of the master's plays he went to sleep
before the end of the first act.
Yet the martyrdom redeemed all else.
It happened on this wise. On December
24, the postman brought him an invitation
to spend Christmas with a nephew, some-
where in the wilds of Kensington. Uncle
JACK consented, little knowing what was
in store for him. All went well till
January 26, when destiny decreed that
the nephew should sprain his knee. Now
it HO happened that the nephew had in-
vited numerous olive branches (more or
less related) to a children's party on that
day. The nephew's own family was
tolerably large; and one may say with-
out exaggeration that the atmosphere of
the house was decidedly cheerful. Uncle
JACK loved cheerful, healthy children—at
a distance, but he was now called upon
to act, pro tern., as host. Not only was
he required to preside at the party, but
to personally conduct several detach-
ments of nephews and ncices and friends
to various pantomimes. Now, for a middlo-
agrd man who is sensitive to noiso, and
who is prone to gout, with occasional
intervals for asthma, the part which
Uncle JACK was suddenly called upon to
assume was of a character beside which
the rack, and other mediaeval tortures,
seem merely healthy exercises. In an
age when novelists play so unsparingly
.

"WHILE YOU WAIT."
"HmiE, MY GOOD MAN, JUST PULL THOSE KAILS DOWN. Be AS QUICK AS YOU CAN I"
"TAKE 'EH DOWN, Miss! IT'LL HE A GOOD FOUR HOUES' JOB, FOP. I'vs BEEN ALL
THE MORN.IN' A-PUTTIN' OF "EM UP!"
upon our emotions I will be as reticent
as possible. These are a few bald facts.
From December 26 to January 16, Uncle
JACK took part in ton games of blind post,
flvo games of musical chairs, and sat out
three pantomimes (four hours each). Need
I give further details?
In the middle of January a decrepit and
weary individual tottered down Middle
Temple Lane. He crawled up the stairs
to his chambers, and flung himself into an
armchair, surrounding himself immediately
with a halo of Temple dust. It symbolised
his martyrdom.
The winter sun (quite good-tempered at
being able to make himself seen) sent a
flood of yellow light over the martyr. In
tho dishevelled and still scantier locks
could be seen tho traces of childish
endearments. On the careworn face and
dazed expression could be read (to slightly
alter SYDNEY SMITH) the legend " 'gagged'
to death by wild comedians." The palsied
limbs bespoke those, terrible orgies—
musical chairs. The shrunken figure
pointed plainly to the terrible struggles
of blind post. Even the watch had lost
its spring-case (having been "blown
open" by so many infants). Truly a
harrowing sight. And, reader, should you
happen to meet Uncle JACK for tho next
few months, breathe not the word panto-
mime! Martyrs are like worms in one
respect. A. R.

How Granfer Volunteered.
BY M. E. FRANCIS.
LONG before dawn on the morrow the household was astir;
TOM plodding over the rimy fields in the -wake of Chrisxy,
Grandma hunting up the uniform, POLLY turning over her
belongings in search of a red felt petticoat which, she de-
clared, matched it so well in colour and texture that portions
of it might be used to widen the jacket, and ANNIE arming her-
self with scissors, needles and thread, in order to carry out
the necessary alterations. Round the kitchen lire they all
presently gathered, eagerly assisting Granfer to "try on";
everyone talking at once, and everyone sneezing, for Grandma
was too good a manager not to have provided against the
destructive moth by embalming the uniform in quantities of
camphor and pepper.
After almost superhuman efforts, Granfer was inducted into
the jacket, his back having somewhat the appearance of a large
red pincushion, while between the lower edge of the coat and
the top of the Sunday trousers, a good<leal of grey flannel shirt
was plainly visible. As for meeting in front, that, as Mrs.
SAMPSON had foretold, the garment could by no means be in-
duced to do, until ANNIE had deftly contrived to insert large
strips of POLLY'S red petticoat at the sides and in the sleeves.
"I expect I shall have to get a new 'un," remarked Granfer,
endeavouring to obtain a back view of himself, and squinting
violently in the attempt. "This hero coat do soem too shart
bo/iind. I reckon I'd best take off thiccy shirt; it didn't
ought to stick out like that.i The jacket 'ud fit bettor over my
singlet."
"Take off your shirt!" screamed his wife. "That 'ud )xj a
pretty thing to do. Ye'd bo gettin' laid up wi' lumbaguey
first thing, an' much good yo'd bo at your soldiering then.
Here, I '11 pull it down a bit, and when your sword do go on it
won't show much."
"Keep your arms by your sides, Granfer, so much as you
can," advised ANNIE, "an' then the patches won't be seen."
"Lard! The red do suit 'ee wonderful, I "m sure," groaned
PoiLY, admiringly. "I think the QUEEN herself would be
pleased if she could see ye."
Granfer smiled, much gratified, and then sat down to break-
fast.
A towel had been hung out in the hedge, which was the
recognised signal to JOYCE, the carrier, that ho was expected
to draw up for a consignment of some kind, and presently one
of the children running in announced that the van was at the
gate. TOM led round Chritmy, a, sagacious animal, mild in the
eye, long in the tooth, and with a figure more matronly than
symmetrical.
TOM had, as he explained, managed to get a good bit o' grease
out of her coat, though ho had not had time to trim her fetlocks,
which were indeed marvellously shaggy, while her rusty tail
almost swept the ground.* Granfer appeared in the doorway
with his weeping family clinging to him, his sword in his hand,
his cap set at a jaunty angle on the top of his bald head, but
with the rest of his military glory hidden beneath a comfortable
frieze coat.
After explaining his project to Mr. JOYCE, the carrier, who
was speechless with admiration and astonishment, and laying
the saddle inside the van, Granfer, tearing himself from his
womankind, climbed up beside the driver. And so they set off,
with poor Chritssy meekly following at the rear of the vehicle
and the distracted family standing by the gate until the
"clipper-clopper" of her heavy hoofs sounded faint in the
distance.
******
What was the joyful surprise of the SAMPSON household when,
late on that same day, Mr. JOYCE'S van was observed to slacken
is it appoached their house, and, moreover, the jaded form of
;he faithful C'/m'ssy was seen to bo jogging in the rear, when,
ndeed, the well-known bellow of Granfer himself hailed them
'rom a distance of a hundred yards or so, and, presently, his
jurly figure alighted from the vehicle.
'Well," he remarked, with an odd expression in which per-
plexity appeared to struggle with relief. "I be como back,
ye see."
'Dear heart alive, Granfer! I be main glad!" ejaculated
Airs. SAMPSON, breathlessly. "Lard, I can't tell 'ee how glad
I be! There, I 've been a-frettin' of myself to death very near
all day! Hut however did they come to let you off?"
'Well," said Granfer, after nodding farewell to Mr. JOYCE,
and waiting till the van had proceeded on its. way, "I were a
bit surprised myself, but it seems I've missed the job by three
months."
"Why, how 's that?" cried POLLY and ANNIK together, while
Grandma, with groans of gratitude, remarked she didn't care
how many months it was—she was only too thankful he luid
missed it.
'If I 'd ha' been turned seventy," went on the farmer, his face
vacillating oddly between triumph and disappointment, "I 'd
iiave been took on; but come in, an' I '11 tell ye all about it."
Having been installed in his .elbow-chair, having unbuttoned
his tunic, and pushed his cap to the back of his head, Granfer
legan his recital.
"When we did get near Blanohestcr, I did say to carrier,
JOYCE,' says I,' you did best let mo down here.' So he did pull
ip, and I did get out saddle and put it on Christy, and rub so
much of the dust off her as I could wi' a handful o' straw, but the
poor boast was awful hot, what wi' her long coat, and what wi'
joggin' so far. However, up I gets, and did ride alongside o'
Mr. JOYCE till wo got to the town, and I turned off towards
barracks. Well, I reckon I must ha' been the first o' the old
soldiers o' Darset as axed to take service again, for everyone
'the place was a-turnin' to look at me, same as if I 'd bsen a
show. Ye see, I 'd took off my coat, and laid it across saddle in
'ront of I, and they couldn't help but set> what 'twas I were
arter. When I did get to barracks, they did all come gatherin'
round me, laughin' and cullin' out, an' makin* such a din as you
never did hear."
"Lard, now, Granfer, what were that for?" inquired Mrs.
SAMPSON indignantly.
"I couldn't tell 'ee, I 'm sure," he replied, with lofty disdain.
1 Ignorance, I suppose. As I was sayin', I don't think many
old soldiers can have offered theirselves yet. Well, I didn't
take no notice, but jist axed for an officer, and by-an'-bye one
come out, an' he looks first at I, an' then at Chrissy, an1 then, if
ye '11 lielieve me, he began to laugh.
"' Why, my good man,' says he, ' what may you want?'
"'Sir,' says I, 'I did see in the paper yesterday, as the
QUEEN was axin' of her old soldiers to come an' j'ine again, so I
be a-come to offer my services.'
"The impident lads round, they fair roared; but the officer
stopped laughing, an' he says, 'Well done,' says he. 'Will you
dismount an' come with me for a minute or two, an' we can talk
the matter over. Your mure will stand, I think,' says he, very
serious.
"'B'es,' says I, 'he'll stand right enough, if he bain't
meddled wi'.'
"' So he told off one of the men to see to 'en, an' I did off
Chrisay, an' did walk alongside o' the officer indoor to a room.
"' To begin with,' says he smilin' very kind, 'what be your
name, an' what be your employment?'
"' JAMES SAMPSON be my name, Sir,' said I; 'I be a farmer,
an' lives yonder at Biverton, fourteen mile away. 'Tis a bit
ill-convenient for I to leave home jist now—'tis a busy time o'
year wi' us farmers, d'ye see, what wi' its bein' larnbin' time,

QUEEN herself did ax us to j'ine again, I wouldn't like for to
disapp'int Her Majesty.'
"' Quite right, quite right,' says he, very grave aa' kind.
'Ail how long is it, Mr. SAMPSON, since you were a soldier?
Judging by your uniform,' says he, lookin' at it rather hard, 'it
must ha' been some time ago.'
"' Well, Sir,' says I, ''tis a matter o' thirty year since I did
leave the Darset Yeomanry. 1 went out \vi' 'em for fifteen year,
an' I didn't miss a single trainin' ; but when my father died, an'
1 did settle down upon tho farm, my missus were a bit agin' it
so I did give up.'"
"Oh, SAMPSON, whatever made ye bring my name into it,"
said Mrs. SAMPSON, bashfully. "I 'm sure I don't know -what-
ever the gentleman can ha' thought."
"It didn't seem to put "en out a bit. 'Thirty years ago,' says
he, 'an' fifteen years before that. How old are you now?'
"I told 'en I 'd be seventy in a few months.
"'Ah,' says he, an' then he looks at me solemn-like for a
minute, an' then he says, 'Well, Mr. SAMPSON, I admire your
sperrit, an' I've no doubt,'says he, 'the QUEEN'ud be extremely
gratified if she knew of the offer you have made. But there arc
one or two objections'
"' Why, Sir,' says I, ' what 'a ag'in' it?'
"' Why,' says he, ' your figure is ag'in' it, to begin with.'
"' Well, Sir,' says I, 'I know very well I haven't ezactly tho
kind o' figure to go climbin' up kopgees an' that. I 'm not
a-volunteerin' for foreign service,' says I; 'but I understood
as the QUEEN was axin' her old soldiers to undertake the de-
fence o' the country, an' I reckon I could do that so well as
another. I can shoot a bit,' says I. 'Ye '11 7iot find many crows
about my fields,' I says; 'they be too much afeard o' me an'
my gun.'
"'Well said,' cries he, clapping me on the shoulder. 'But
then there 's your age to think about, Mr. SAMPSON. Sixty-nine,
I think you said?'
"'Sixty-nine years and nine months, Sir,' says I.
"' Ah,' he says, 'that's the difficulty.'
"'How so, Sir?' says I. 'I be a-comin' up to my three-
scorc-and-ten, Sir.'
"'Ah,' he says again, and looks at me very solemn, 'I'm
afraid it won't do. Now I '11 tell you what you 'U do, Mr.
SAMPSON. Just you go quietly home again, and wait till ye 're
called upon. I'm much obliged,' says he, 'for your handsome
offer. You're a plucky fellow,' he says, an' he shakes me by
the hand, 'an" if we find we can't get on -without you, you may
be sure we '11 send for you.'
"So he comes with me to the door, arid -the ill-nianncred folk
as was standin' there did begin a-laughin' again so soon as
they ketched sight o' me, but the officer threw up his hand
and stopped 'em.
"' Men,' says he, ' I 'm going to call upon you to give three
cheers for this fine old Briton!'—these was the very words he
said, I do assure you—' this flue old Briton,' says he."
"Did he now? Well, that was right down handsome," cried
ANNIE and POLI.Y together, while Grandma, overcome with
emotion, fairly wept.
"E'es. I do 'low I thought it kind of him. 'Three cheers
for this flue old Briton,' says he. 'He's made of the right
staff. He has come hero at great personal inconvenience to
offer his services to Queen and Country, and I say we may be
proud to think there are such men among us. Come, lads, a
henrty cheer! Hip, hip, hip'
"Well, I 'd managed to get up on Chrissij by this time, and
they all run round me, cheerin' and wavin' their caps, and I
saluted 'em back, pleasant-like; and Chrissy and me walked off
wi' ourselves so proud as Punch. So, though they didn't take
us on, ye see we 've had what ye mid call a good day."
"'E'es indeed, Grandfer," returned his Missus, delighted,
but tearful still. "I 'm sure we may all feel proud. And I am
but too thankful as they didn't take ye on. Dear heart alive!
'Twas a narrow escape—ye '11 be seventy in nest to no
time."
"True, true," agreed Granfer. "'Twas a thing I didn't even
think on—but 'tis plain to be seen the reason why they didn't
take I. They did ax for old soldiers, and I weren't old enough."
CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOB YOUNG RIDERS.
CHAP. VI. (CONTINUED).
On converting icitfc the Matter—on worrying him — on being
obtrush'e—the advantage of opening a gate.
ONE rule for conversation with a Master of Hounds may
safely be laid down. It is this:—Do not interrupt him with
unseasonable babble. There are some foolish, if well-meaning,
persons who seem to imagine that a Master's only duty is to
make himself the receptacle of every stale bit of information
that can be drawn from the back numbers of the Field, or of
any silly remark about the weather, the scent, the chances of
finding a fox, the size of the field, the looks of the hounds, or any
other ordinary topic from which the witlessness of man can
extract a stupid commonplace. The Master is, in a sense, a
public character, but lie is in no sense the public property of
every gentleman who may do him the honour of riding after,
in front of, or even over his hounds. The Master has big things
to think about. Jf he hunts his own hounds, his time and his
tongue are fully occupied; but even if he merely performs the
usual ceremonial duties of his station he has no leisure for
chatter. Do you, therefore, respect your Master, and so
order your own conduct that he shall respect you. Don't
obtrude yourself on his notice as one rashly seeking reputa-
tion. It is unnecessary, for instance, if you should observe
a hound or two lagging or straying that you should make for
them, and rate them with a great to-do and much cracking of
your whip, and loud " Get-away-on-to-him's!" You may do this
once and escape, but if you try it a second time it's a thousand
to one you '11 find some such words as these hurtling after you:
"All right. Sir, all right; I've got plenty of whips for the
job. We '11 let you know when there 's a vacancy," or, "Now
then, yon, Sir, on the chestnut, let my hounds alone," or any
other of those crushing remarks which come from a Master
with all the force and deadly effect of a one-pound shell from a
pom-pom.
On the other hand, it is to be remembered that a Master,
though his station is lofty, is, after all, human. He doesn't want
to be worried—who docs ?—but he never resents a crisp and
cheerful saying dropped, as it were, into tho gaps of a run at
the proper psychological moment, nor will he fail to note with
approval a ready obedience or an unobtrusive willingness to
oblige on the part of a young rider. For instance, if you see a
Master in trouble with a gate, you can never lose caste by
springing off and opening it for him. "Much obliged," he'll
say; "I'll remember you in my will." "Too long to wait,
Sir," you can reply. "Won't you make it a bit earlier?" The
Master will smile—even these great ones of the earth un-
bend and smile—and the Master's friends will be pleased, and
Miss MIRABEL, as you let her through directly afterwards, will
give you one of of Oiose bewitching looks that set your novice
heart thumping under your well-striped and brass-buttoned
waistcoat. And in the evening, as you are riding home, you
may chance to find yourself alongside the Master, and he will
discuss with you the incidents of the day's sport, and will even
listen with respect to your reasons for believing that at a
certain point the hounds changed foxes. After that, if you
have common intelligence, you should have no more anxiety.

ARRANT KNIGHTS.
[A modern lecturer has discovered that Hooli-
ganism " arises from a perverted sense of chivalry."
Mr. r.tnch might have hesitated to accept this
pronouncement if a correspondent had not (nll'd
his attention to the following passage from Malory,
which hud escaped his memory, but which certainly
seems to support the theory.]
THEN were Sir HOOLIGAN and Sir PEAKY
and Sir LARRIKIN ware of an unarmed
Knight passing by, and with him LA BKIJ,E
ARRIETTE. And they ran a great wallop
and rashed him to the ground, and then
they feutred their feet and gave him many
and great kicks, so that his head all to-
brast. And when LA BELLE ARRIETTK saw
him Ho as one dead, she shrieked wonderly
sore, and ran to Sir PEELEREAU and be-
sought him that he would do battle upon
those felon knights. And Sir PEELEREAU
drew liis staff, that hight x-Calibre (for
that no man knew of what power it might
be), and he ran upon those three, and they
would not abide his onset but avoided the
place. Howbeit, Sir HOOLIGAN in his flight
did pass by LA BELLE ARRIETTE, and smote
her woundily upon the boko, so that the
blood gushed forth. Then did Sir LAHRI-
KIN let cry a rescue, and a great press of
other knights gathered together, and they
beset Sir PEELEREAU twenty against one.
But Sir PKELEREAU put x-Calibre before
him, and dressed himself against them, so
that they durst not come anigh him. And
when Sir HOOLIGAN saw that Sir PEELEREAU
was a good man of his hands and might
not be overcome, he drew his dagger, that
hight couteau-de—cheese, and came stilly
stalking, and ran upon him from behind
and drove it into his back. And Sir
PEELEREAU gave a marvellously grisly
groan and fell down in a swoon, and the
ground was all to-bled. So Sir HOOLIGAN
had great honour amongst the other
knights, and right willingly went LA
BELLE ARRIETTE with him to the Palace
of Joyous Ginne, and they made merry
until they were assotted. E. T. H.

TARTARIN A BRIGHTON.
RENCONTRE DANS LA BRUME.
Ex quittant 1'hotel, TARTARIN, toujours prudent, avait de-
mande la route. "A gaucho," dit-il, "et encore la huitiemc
rue a gauche." An milieu do la brume, sous le jour blafard,
les Tarasconnais avancaient lentement. Us voyaient los fene-
trcs des maisons ct des magasins, tons fermes, et k 1'autre
cote dii trottoir, les silhouettes des reverberes. An dolk rien.
II n'y avait persoum*. Tons les braves bourgeois mangeaient
lo rnsbif du dimanche.
Enlin, vers los doux heures, BRAVIDA les arreta. "C'est par

Bo.MPAlU), "ce n'est quo la septieme," Lii-dessus ils com-
meneerent a discuter, ma is I'ilhistro TARTARIN les interrompit,
"Zoii, pas de querelles, suivons cette rue." Et ils s'cnga-
gerent dans line ruelle sombre ct descrte.
C'etait un vrai coupe-gorge. TARTAIUN, toujours eveille,
pensnit aux guets-apcns, aux attaques nocturnes, aux pirates,
aux Sioux, aux Touaregs, do sos lectures. Ils etaient la, peut-
etre. Enlln Un 1'attendaiont. Los mains sui1 ses pistolcts,

et u droite des maisons sombres et fermei'S, (levant lui la ruelle
lugubn>, la brume, 1'obscurite.. Plus loin une autre ruelle, un
tas d(! petites rues inornes et de'sortos. Los Tarasconnais
s'etaiont cgares. Brusquement, a un detour, TARTARIN s'arreta.
Ses camarades, se rcfugiant dcrriore lui, clierchaiout a voir
1'obstaele qui reinpechait d'avancer. Ils n'apercovaient rien.
Mais TARTARIN, un vrai scant qui voit tout, les indiqua d'un
gcste uno forme immobile au travel's de la brume. C'etait un
hominc gigantesque.
"Pas un mot," ehuehota 1'intrcpido president, "suivez-moi
a IH lllo, en avant!" Avec inille precaution sils avaneerent.
Par mnlhenr, a ee moment supreme, PASCALON tremblait ate]
point quo son paraplnie henrta son chapeau de soie et le fit
tomber par torn-. L'homme He retourna. C'etait un policeman.
De pres il ne paraissait pas si enorme, et il avait une bonne-
figure rouge et sourianto de mangeur de biftecks. Les
Tnraseonnais ctaient rassures, sauf peut-etre TARTARIN, a qui
ils echappaient eneoi-o.
Mais le sevgent do ville, des qu'il les apercut, ne sourit plus
Un cri lui echappa, "Tlie Boers, the bloomin' Doers, landed at
last!" Ces homines etranges, emergeant de la brume, lu
semblaient des envahisseurs venus du Transvaal, t'n instant i
he^ita, un instant, peut-etre, il pensa a sa femme, a ses enfants,
et puis il tira son baton, et d'un ton d'autorite, " Stop!" dit-il.
Devant lui quatre Boers armes, probablement une vingtaine,
une centaine, tous les hommes de 1'expedition, derriere lui
a loi, la patrie, le home. II no bougoa pas.
"Le dictionnaire, PASCALON," dit TARTARIN, "avancez done,
ct traduisez." Le pauvre jeune homme, qui pensa mourir de
)eur, obeit quand memo. Mais lorsqu'il essaya d'une main
remblante de tirer le dictionnaire de sa poche, le policeman
ui saisit le bras, et cria, "Drop it, leave your revolver alone."
3t PASCALON, le baton au-dessus de la tete, se laissa tomber
aux pieds de .1'agent, e^ murmura, agenouille, " Ayez pitie, de
grace!"
Que faire? Les Tarasconnais restaient interloques. Le
ooliceman, lorsqu'il les voyait si tranquils, si paisibles, etait
etonn£. "Well," flt-il, "of all the bloomin' Jlocrs!"
"Qu'est-ce qu'il dit?" s'e'cria TARTARIN. "Les Boers? Te,
>•£, est-ce qu'il pensent que nous sommes des Boers?"
"Evidemment," repondit BRAVIDA, "mais comment lui ex-
pliquer que nous no sommes pas, sans le dictionnaire, sans
PASCALON."
Lo savoir-faire de TARTARIN ne manque jamais. "Tout sim-
plemont," dit-il, "chantons le God Have." "Impossible!"
repondirent les autres. "Nous ue le savons pas." Mais ce
diable d'homrae, qui sait tout, chanta de sa belle voix, sans
hesiter un instant, " God fiave tra la la la, tra la la la la la."
II nesavait pas les mots. Et puis, "Aoh yes! Hipip honrra!"
"Wlmt!" s'ecria le policeman, tout souriant. "Then yon' re
not Boers? But," poursuivit-il, et son front s'a.ssombrit de
nouveau, " are you pro-Biters'?"
Et TARTARIN do recommencer, " God fiare tra la la la." "All
riijkt," dit 1'autre, encore plus aimablc, "neitliej" Boers nor
pro-Boers." "Pas Boers," rt-pondit TARTARIN, qui ne coinprit
que co seul mot, "pas Boers. Francais." Et comme si
1'agent eiait sourd, parce qu'il ne comprenait pas, lo Taras-
connais rep^ta et hurla d'une voix formidable, "Francais,
Francais."
"Frenchy?" demanda le brave policeman, nussi intelligent
que courageux, et imitant le l:ingage musical dc TARTARIN\ il
se mit a sifller, pas trop mill, 1'air du refrain de la Marseillaise.
Les Meridionaux etaient enchantes. TARTARIN saisit la grosse
main du gardien de la paix, et la serra vigoureusement. Ho.M-
I'ARD et BRAVIDA firent de memo. PASCALON, assis par terre,
osa lever la tete et les rcgarder plus hardimont.
Mais comment se tirer de 1'embarras? Inutile de visitor c<
Pavilion, car il etait trois heures et on ne voyait rien. Il
fallait rebrousser chemin et regagner 1'hotel avant la unit.
Comment faire comprendre au policeman qu'ils ne savaient
pas oil nller, qu'ils s'etaient egares, qu'ils ch(M'chaient 1'Hotel
Splendide? Meme devant tout ca I'intrepido TARTAHIN nc recula
pas. II s'approcha tout pres do l'agcnt, il cria "Splendide"
plusicurs fois, et puis il entonna 1'air du
Home, tiiveet Home, qu'il avait entondu
quelque part. Et le policeman comprit ;i
merveille, les guida jusqu'u la grando
promenade, et indiqua d'un geste qu'il
fallait suivre a droite. En signe de
reconnaissance TARTARIN tira son etui de
sa poche. donna au brave homme les trois cigares qui s'y
trouvaient, et hurla arnicalement, "Aoli yen. Hipip /ic/urm.'"
"Maitre," dit PASUALON, saisi d'admiration, "vous parlez
anglais mieux que moi." "Ah," repondit 1'illustre philologue
nonchalamment, "chasser le lion, fairo 1'ascension du Mont
Blanc, parler les langues etrangeres, tout ca est facile si Ton
se met carrement u 1'oeuvre." Et chemin faisant il ajouta,
"Demain, s'il fait beau, nous irons au port, oil nous trouveron*
un bateau quelconque pour faire une excursion en iner ai
moins." H. D. 15.

11.—FAME AND THE WOMAN.
TUB woman's suspicions were confirmed
the moment she saw him. KITTY SYL-
VESTER knew only too well that EmvAHD
VANCITHAT, the distinguished novelist,
dramatist and poet, expected much from
the woman who aspired to be his wife.
How often, as children playing together
had they not built airy castles, planning
for each other a wonderful career of un-
interrupted success and public homage!
She remembered his words even now,
though spoken fifteen years ago, as they
wandered through the green meadows
bordering their homes. "My wife must
be beautiful and famous,1' lie had said.
And she in her childish fancy had imposed
similar conditions with regard to her
husband.
EDWARD had embraced a literary career
and met with a full measure of success,
while she, Krm" SYLVESTER, an actress.
What had she accomplished? She saw in-
stinctively, with a woman's intuition
(which saves the humble romancist such a
lot of description), in EDWARD'S demeanour
a scarcely veiled look of reproach. It
tinged his whole manner with a chill re-
serve. And when she remembered how
she had longed all through the tedious
fifteen years for this moment; this meet-
ing of children-loveni after each had
taken a place in the great theatre of life,
her heart failed her at his douhts. A
great oppression seized her, u chill linger
seemed to clutch ut her throat (this must
only be taken metaphorically), and' a
despairing voice cried in her ear, "Ho
doubts your fame, he doubts it!"
* * * *
"Ah, how can you doubt?" cried KITTY,
her eyes flashing in petulant defiance.
"Surely you have followed my stage
career?"
"Yes," he admitted.
"You have seen, how I have played
inijenvex, adventuresses, leading ladies—"
"True, true."
"And Hhakspcatv. Not a heroine of the
great master, but I have played her for
all she was worth"
"I know," said VANCITHAT, with a note
of sad reflection.
"I have been compared to EI.LKN TERRY,
Mrs. SIDDONH"
The man shrugged his shoulders.
"1 am interviewed at least once a
week."
"Yes, but"
"My portrait is in all the shop windows,
in all the illustrated papers"
"Yes," said VANCITHAT, but without
conviction.
"Oh, how can I allay your doubts."
said KITTY, looking round her in genuine
agony. "I—I am referred to as the great
actress, my comings and goings are noted,
my gowns described in detail"
"Toadvertiscthedressmaker," retorted
EDWARD, coldly.
"See! " exclaimed the woman, bringing
forward a ponderous volume. "See!"
and she let the pages slip from beneath
her dainty finger points. "The twenty-
eighth volume of press notices."
The man knew too much of the dark side
of professional life to attach any impor-
tance to this. He shook his head sadly.
"Society has taken me up," exclaimed
KITTY, with an attempt at a laugh.
"Surely—surely that says something for
my fame ?''
VANCITHAT reproached KITTY'S reckless
optimism with a deep sigh.
She saw the little barrier of icy reserve
springing up between them.
"EWVARD, ED WARD, "she cried |)iteously,
"do not look at me like that! Tell me,
how 1 can prove my claim to be worthy
of your great and deep, deep love! 1 tell
you, I am famous"
The man caught at her wrists, and gazed
with fearful intensity into her frightened
(but still sin passingly lovely) face.
"Tell me," he half-shouted, gripping
her wrists till she cried out with the
pain. "Tell me, have you written a
testimonial to a Hair Wash, or a Face
Powder'! Tell me"
The woman's face blanched. "Xo.no,"
she wailed. The hands released from the
man's passionate grasp fell to her sides.
VAXCITIIAT gave a groan of anguish. Ah!
Heaven, she had tried to deceive him.
She was not famous. The great criterion
of fame had condemned her.

"WE expect to attack in
force to-morrow — indeed,
the movement should have
been made to-day, but I
had not quite finished my

termined to risk nothing by

my gallant force in line,

The unmannerly enemy had
the bad taste to open fire
long before I had con-
cluded my remarks, and our
casualties, in consequence,
were rather numerous. I
am despatching a protest

that he is a saucy varlet,

will exact due vengeance

yesterday was not quite
successful, owing chiefly to
the enemy's not following
the rules of fictitious war-

perceived that our left flank was some-

rallied it in person, and directed a
charge against our enemies, but we had
to retreat in some disorder.

victory before long.

That she might give her life in place of

Torn from the anus of Death, to plague
me thus?
This was your boon, in sooth no Ixion to me.

blessing is a wife
Who saves your life
And then doth make it doubly hard to

Alas, sho doth but give
A gift we cannot prize
But count it in our eyes
As nothing worth—a thing to spurn, to
cast away,
To form the theme of this depreciatory
lay!

it is to find
This kingly mind
So much disturbed, this kingly heart no

By thy too active tongue!

But oh, how wrong it is
To make that life which thou so nobly
didst restore

When shall ye see again
The pence that once ye h \d

In wrath,
And doom you to a tedious life of fear and

Of unavailing tears and unconcealed

shame
Shall cloud thy previous fame
Who brought this lady back
Along the black

To those Tartarean lulls which hear no

And why, once dead, did I return again

Why did you bear me back to this sad place,
This palace where ADMKTUS sits en-
throned?
Oh, what a disagreeable fate it is
To live with Biich a husband—hear his
voice
Raised ever in complaint, and have no
word
Of gratitude for all I did for him I
Was there another creature in the world
Who willingly would die for such a man?
Not one! His father, aged though he was,
Scouted the proposition as absurd.
His mother, when approached, declined in
terms
Which I should hesitate to reproduce,
So frank and so unflattering they were.
But I, 1 gave my life instead of his,
And what is my reward? A few cold
words
Of thanks, a complimentary phrase or two,
And then he drops the subject, thinks no
more
About the matter and is quite annoyed

I accidentally allude to it!

In this extremely inconsiderate way.
Depend upon it when a lady dies
It's most unwise to call her back again.

As good a wife as any man could wish,

Chorus.
Is this really to put
An end to our cares,
To the toils where our foot-
Was caught unawares?
Will HERACLES really put straight this
unfortunate state of affairs?
Will he overthrow Death
For the second time here?
Will he do as he saith
And in due time appear
With the news which will lay fair ALCES-
TIS a second time out on her bier?
She will die, she proclaims,
With the utmost good-will,
And she calls us all names
In a voice that is shrill
While she vows that the sight of AD-
.M !•: it's, her husband, is making her ill!
It hardly seems wise
To spurn and reject
Your husband with cries—
To which all men object,
But ADMETUS is scarcely the husband to
inspire any wife with respect.

A hero confessed!
But he twiddles his thumbs
And looks somewhat depressed.

Well, all I can say is, I 'in blest!

Heracles, lou 1 Ion!
Admetus. Don't yap like that. Speak
up. What is your news?
Heracles. My friends, I saw Death slink-
ing down the drive.
I stopped him, told him that this lady
here
Was anxious for his escort to the Shades,
Reminded him that I had once before
Rescued her from his grasp, and pointed
oi:t
low generous I was thus to restore
What then I took. In fact, I put the best
Complexion on the matter that I could.
Alcestis. Well? Did he say that he
would take me back?
Heracles. By no means. Ho declined
emphatically.
Ic will not take you upon any terms.
Jeath is no fool; he knows what he's
about!
\ilnii'iin. But did you not compel him
to consent?
Heracles. I did my best. We had a bout
or two
Of wrestling, but he threw me every time.
Finally, out of breath, and sadly mauled,
I ran away—and here I am, in fact.
Alcestis. You stupid, clumsy, fat, de*-

When I approached him, would not take
her back?
At Inn-1 it*. I can't pretend I 'm very much

Although, if you will pardon the remark,
I thiuk you might have made a better
flght.
Better not stay to dine. It's hardly safe.
ALCESTIS isn't to be trifled with,
And if she murdered you I should bo

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"IT is difficult," quoth the Baron, "to believe that so
Insipid and commonplace a story as Morals and Millions (F. V.
WHITE <fe Co.) is by FLORENCE WARDEN, authoress of that strong
melodramatic romance TJie House on the Marsh. Yet so it is,
and FLORENCE WARDEN must hasten to give us something worthy
of her reputation."
IN his Eccentricities of Genim (CHATTO AND WTINDUS) Major POND
introduces ninety well-known personages, most of whom he
induced to lecture in the United States under his able manage-
ment. They are all interesting. To my Baronite, the most
attractive revelation of character made in the bulky volume is
that of the Major himself. With rare access of modesty,
ho devotes only some nine pages to autobiography. But in
sketching others
tho gallant Major
involuntarily
looms clear on
the sheet. He is
tho kind of man
grown only on the
vast expanse, in
the electrical air,
of the United
States. To supreme
capacity for busi-
ness he adds almost
lioyisli enthusiasm.
W a r m-h e a r t e d,
generous, expan-
sively hospitable,
all he asks in retui n
is that the lecturer
he happens to be
managing shall be
able for a given
number of days, as
per contract, to
address an audi-
ence morning and
evening, to travel
all night in t! e
cars, to assist in
advertising by
receiving clusto s
of reporters at any
hour they may pre-
sent themselves,
and (if in holy
orders) throw in a sermon on a Sunday morning or evening.
Judged by this standard, HENRY STANLEY, Who, of course,
omitted tho sermon, established the profoundest claim on the
Major's respect. After him comes IAN McLAREN, who doubtless
owed something of his success to the start the Major gave
him. Ho entertained him at luncheon immediately on his
landing at New York. "I ordered," he writes, and
you can almost hear him smacking his lips, "a largo
double sirloin steak and hashed brown potatoes with
cream, just what never fails to catch an Englishman."
It failed with MATTHEW ARNOLD, with results the Major
summarises. "MATTHEW ARNOLD came to this country
and gave 100 lectures. Nobody'ever heard any of them,
not even those sitting in the front row." That's what
comes of shirking a large double sirloin steak and
hashed brown potatoes with cream. The lectures were
entertaining enough, as appears from the enormous
takings at the doors. Most entertaining of all—that
is, if ho 's writing not about you but your friends—is
the ingenuous Major.
Ttie Book of Saints and Friendly Reasts (LONGMAN, GHEEN &
Oo.) by A nun; FARWELL BROWN, Is delightful in many respects,
and would have been still more delightful had the writer
not colloquialised his stories as if telling them to twentieth-
century children of a rather up-to-date-ish class. The fascinat-
ing legends of Saint Francis of Assisi arc the best told in this
volume. The Baron has much pleasure in widely recommending
this little book. The illustrations by FANNY Y. CORY, with the
exception of St. Cuthbert's vision, are scarcely worthy of tho
subjects. . THE BARON DE B.-W.

Visitor to draw
thespecial and par-

and numbered, in the catalogue, "46." It represents a royal group
painted by Sir FRANCIS GRANT, P.R.A. The youthful QUEEN, a
sweet young mother, is seated holding a bonny baby, the Prince
of WALES, on her lap; beside her stands the Princess Royal, :i
tiny tot, holding out a biscuit to two dogs. It comes from
the Royal Collection, and was lent, as the catalogue
informs us, by "H.M. the QUEEN." This is not a
masterpiece of Sir FRANCIS GRANT'S, but its interest
is unique.
The exhibition is open for another six weeks. It is
an exhibitiou of tho works of MILLAIS, ALFRED STEVENS

(memorable work), of the brief-lived genius FRED

You 'RE more than seven, you "re three

As you declare with pride,
You 're twenty-one! Of age, "the Brat"
About to become a bride.
"What shall I give you, O Brat, to-day
To prove in peace we part?
No !—I will not give myself away
Since yon have lost your heart.
Shall I give you a tress of raven hair
That is now of ruddy hue?
A miracle changed the colour, I swear,
Not a bottle of Carmine Dew.
Shall, I lay at your feet, O Brat, the

That flowed from your facile pen?
No! they '11 act as the best of antidotes
To the poison of "Notv" and " Then."
Shall I send you a ribbon or left hand

Interior of a dreary room in the War
Office. A. tired-looking young officer,
in mufti, sits at a table with great
piles of papers, each bundle tied with
red tape and ticketed with labels oj
different colours, on one side of it
ready to his hand. Another pile oj
papers, which lie has already dealt with,
is on the other side of the table. He
is an official and IMS many letters, the
first two being D.A. after his name
The gas lias just been lighted. A. clerk
brings in another fat bundle of papers
The Officer (patting the smaller pile on
the table). These can go on, SMITHERS
That question of sardine-openers must go
back to the commissariat, and the Genera
Commanding the Central District must be
authorised to deal on his own responsibility
with the matter of the fierce bull in the
field where the recruits bathe. "What
have you got there?
The Clerk. It is the correspondence
Sir, relative to that false tooth requisi
tioned for by the Officer Commanding the
Rutlandshire Regiment for the first corne
of the band. The Medical Departmen
sent it back to us this morning, and then
is another letter in from the Colonel
protesting against his regiment being
forced to go route marching to an imper
feet musical accompaniment.
The Officer (groaning). I thought we had
got rid of that matter at last by sending
t to the doctors.
The Clerk. No, Sir. The Surgeon-General
has decided that " one tooth, false, with
jold attachment," cannot be considered a
medical comfort.
The Officer (taking a precis from the top
of the papers). 1 suppose we must go into
,he matter again. It began with the letter
'rom the Colonel to the General?
The Clerk. Yes, Sir; here it is. The
O. C. the Rutland Regiment has the
honour to report that the first cornet
ilayer in the band has lost a tooth, and
as the band has become inefficient in
ihe playing of marching music in con-
sequence, he requests that a false tooth
may be supplied at government expense.
The Officer. And the General, of course,
replied in the usual formula that he had
no fund available for such purpose.
The Clerk. Yes, Sir; but suggested that
ihe regimental band fund might be drawn
on.
The Officer. "Where is the Colonel's
letter in reply. (It is handed to him.) Ah,
yes. Band fund is established, he writes,
for purchase of musical instruments and
music, and not for repair of incomplete
bandsmen, and refuses to authorise ex-
pense, except under order from the
Commander-in-Chief.
The Clerk. The General sends this on to
us, with a remark as to the Colonel's
temper.
The Officer. And we pass it to the
Quarter-Mflster-GeneraFs people, suggest-
ing that under certain circumstances a
false tooth might be considered a "neces-
sary," and a free issue made.
The Clerk. A very long memo, on the
subject, in reply, from the Q.-M.-G., Sir.
He points out that though, under excep-
tional circumstances, a pair of spectacles
might be held to be a sight-protector, a
false tooth could not be held to be either
a fork, a spoon, a shaving-brush, a razor,
or even an oil bottle.
The Officer. We wrote back, suggesting
that it might pass as a "jag "—our little
joke.
The Clerk. Your little joke, Sir. The
Q.-M.-G.'s people didn't see it.
The Officer. No? Then the correspon
dence goes on to the Ordnance Department
with a suggestion that a false tooth might
be considered an arm or an accoutrement
Tlie Clerk. The Director-General replies
Sir, that in the early days of the British
Army, when the Army Clothing Depart-
ment's sole issue was a supply of woad
a tooth, or indeed a nail, might hav
reasonably been indented for as a weapon
but that, owing to the introduction an
perfection of flre-arms, such weapons are
now obsolete and cannot be issued.
The Officer. And now the .Medical Ser-
vice refuse to help us.
The Clerk. Yes, Sir. They cannot brin.
he fixing of it under the head of surgical
perations, and the Surgeon - General
loinis out very justly, if I may be per-
mitted to say so, Sir, that a seal-pattern
alse tooth could hardly be considered a
medical comfort."
The Officer. What are we to do? The
Colonel of the regiment is evidently
'urious.
The Clerk. We might send the cor-
respondence to the Inspector of Iron
Structures. He may be able to do or
suggest something.
The Officer. Very well; and will you send
off this telegram to my wife saying I have
a long evening's work before me, and that
'. shall not be able to get back to dinner
to-night? (Exit the Clerk.) Whenever
will they trust a General Commanding
a District to spend for the public good on
lis own responsibility a sum as large as a
schoolboy's allowance, and so take some of
the unnecessary work off our shoulders?

MY DEAREST ToOTSIE,—I know that you
will be dying to hear what life in the
sunny South is like, and as my brother
BOBBIE has accepted an invitation from a
French nobleman, the Count de FLYCARDE,
to a friendly game of picquet, I seize upon
my first spare moment to write this.
You know, dear, that BOBBIE and I being
rather luxurious, we thought we must
have a courier—so we took COOK'S returns
and thereby obtained the services of a
man (in liver]/) at tons les flares—oh, how
silly I am!—I mean at all the stations.
One gets so into the way of speaking
nothing but French here, that one really
cannot help lapsing into it occasionally.
Well, dear, we made the voyage—Dover to
Calais—safely, and I must say that one
cannot find fault with the supply of basins
on board. They are given quite free of
charge. Of course, we had to pass the
Douane—Customs, I mean—at Calais, and
BOBBIE succeeded in getting through a
packet of his inimitable twopennies—a
special brand without which he never
travels. The Chef de Gore—There I go
again I Oh, isn't it silly of me!—the
Station-master was too charming, and got
us deux places in the train. I think he told
a sous-Ojfjtcier that I was tres joli—rather
nice of him, wasn't it?
Our Parisian experiences lasted nearly
three hours, whilst we waited for the
train South. Naturally, we saw a good
deal of the place, and I have quite de-
cided that ^e life wouldn't suit me:
Give me dear old Upper Tooting, say I»
Then away wo raced to the South. Ah,

it is. \V"o went to sleep in the frost and
darkness, to wake up in baltny air
(Tk)BBIE calls it Balmy-on-the-Crumpet
air!) to see the vineyards full ,of oranges
How y ou 'd like to suck them, TOOTSIE !),
the lemons, the olive-oil, and dates, all
growing together. And the dates; not
like those nasty things we get at JOKE-
SMITHS Stores, but the real thing. Oh,
it's all too lovely. And at last we
reached Cannes, and drove with the rest
of the personally conducted party to the
hotel. Here, whilst walking down the
passages, you can even smell tho onions
growing.
We have not wasted time. The next
day, we went on and did Nice, Beaulieu,
Mentone, and Monte Carlo, where 1 lost
rather heavily—naughty me, to gamble!
I lost five francs at one venture. BOBBIE
went to the Tir on.v Pigeons, and though
he missed all the birds he nearly got one
of tho men who set the traps. We re-
turned to Cannes that night, and the day
after to-morrow leave for old England
again, after an absence of nearly a
week.
1 feel that I shall never settle down
again after our Continental life. It takes
one out of one's groove—not that I mean
that you are one bit "groovy," dear
TOOTSIE—still, of course, you've not had
the chance of travelling abroad and seeing
other places and other people, have you'!
I shall bo back almost as soon as this
reaches you.
From your fond friend,
Tltix.
P.S.—BOBBIE has been unfortunate with
the Count—and, between us, we shall have
to make up forty-five francs to pay for his
losses at picqtiet this afternoon.

DEAMATIC SEQUELS.
VI.—SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.
MANY people must have •wondered
whether happiness resulted from the
marriage bet-ween CHARLES MARLOW,
whose shyness with ladies, it will be
remembered, prevented his ever having a
word to say to any woman above the rank
of a barmaid, and the vivacious KATE
HARDCASTLB. The following sequel reveals
the painful truth. It is called :—
STILL STOOPING.
SCENE.—The parlour oj CHARLES MARLOW'S
house. He and KATE are sitting on
opposite sides of the flre. Silence
reigns, and CHARLES fidgets nervously.
Kate (anticipating a remark subsequently
made by PAULA TANQUERAY). Six minutes!
Cliarles (finding his tongue with an effort).
Er—eh?
Kate. Exactly six minutes, dear, since
you made your last remark.
Charles (laughing uneasily and blushing).
Urn—ah!— ha! ha!
Kate Well? What are you going to say
next? It's really time you made an ob-
servation of some kind, you know.
Cliarles (lielplessly). Um — er — I 've
nothing to say.
Kate (rallying him). Come, make an
effort.
Charles (in desperation). It's—er—a fine
day.
Kate (genially). Considering that it's
raining steadily, dear, and has been for
the past half-hour, I hardly think that can
be considered a fortunate opening.
Charles (covered tinth confusion). Con-
found it! so it is. Forgive me—er—my
dear, I dirln't know what I was saying.
Kate. You very seldom do, dear—to me.
Charles. What a fool you must think
me!
Kate (touched by his evident sincerity).
Never mind, dear. It's a shame to laugh
at you. But you are rather absurd, you
know. (She goes over and kisses him. He
accepts the caress with gratitude, but
blushes painfully.)
Charles. I know, dear. But I 've always
been shy like that. It's an idiosyncrasy.
Kate. Not idiosyncrasy, dear. Idiocy.
The words are so much alike.
Charles (hurt). Ah, now you 're laugh-
ing at me!
Kate. Of course I am, goose. (Argu-
mentatively) You see, dear, as long as
you were a bachelor it was all very well
to be bashful. But now that we are
married, I really think you ought to flght
against it!
Charles. Fight against it! I flght
against it every hour of the day. Every
morning I say to myself, "I really must
get over this ridiculous shyness. I must
try and show KATE how much I—er—love
her."
Kate. You are curiously unsuccessful,
dear.
Cliarles (miserably). I feel that. But
it's not for lack of trying. (Desperately)
Do you suppose, KATE, that anything but
the strongest effort of will keeps me
sitting in this chair at this moment? Do
I ever, savo under compulsion, remain
in the same room with any lady for more
than five minutes? Why, if I didn't love
you to distraction, dear, I shouldn't re-
main here an instant!
Kate. You certainly have a curious
method of displaying an ardent attachment.
Charles. Yes. It's most unfortunate.
But I warned you, dear, didn't I? 1 told
you all about my absurd bashfulness be-
fore we became engaged. You knew that
the presence of ladies invariably reduced
me to spoechlessness before you accepted
me.
Kate (sweetly). Not invariably, my love.
What about your prowess with Mrs.
MANTRAP and Lady BETTY BLACKLEG that
you told me about? (CHARLES blushes
crimson.) Didn't they call you "their
agreeable Rattle" at the Ladies' Club
in Town?
Cliarles. I—er—get on well enough
with—urn—er—disreputable' ladies. But
yon—er—aren't disreputable.
Kate. You are too modest, dear. Some
of your conquests are quite respectable.
Didn't I come upon you in the act of
kissing ANNE, the housemaid, yesterday?
And no one can pretend that my house-
maids are disreputable!
Charles (sighing). Yes. I 'm not shy
with housemaids.
Kate. So I noticed. I sent ANXE away
this morning.
Cliarles (with real concern). Not ANNE!
Kate. Yes. And SARAH too. I thought
I detected in you a lurking penchant for
SARAH.
Charles (simply). Yes, I liked SARAH.
Kate. So now we haven't a single'maid
in the house. It's really very incon-
venient.
Charles. You must get others.
Kate. For you to make eyes at? Cer-
tainly not. By the way, is there any type
of female domestic servant whom you do
not find irresistibly attractive? Dark
ones? Fair ones? Young ones? Old
ones? Tall ones? Short ones? (He shakes
his head at each question.) Not one?
Charles. I 'm afraid not.
Kate (with decision). Then I must do the
house-work myself.
Charles (delighted). Charming! My dear
KATE, how delightful. Put on a cap and
apron and take a broom in your hand, and
my bashfulness will vanish at once. I
know it will.
Kate. It seems the only course open to
us, especially as there 's no one else to
sweep the rooms. But I wish you were
not so unfortunately constituted.
Charles (heartily). So do I. But, after
all, we must accept facts and make the
best of them. You must stoop to
conquer, you know. Go and put on an
apron at once.
SCENE II.—CHARLES'S special sitting-room,
where lie is wont to hide his shyness from
visitors. Time, a week later. KATE, in
a print dress, cap and apron, is on her
knees before the fire-place cleaning up
the hearth.
Charles (entering the room unperceived,
stealing up behind her and giving her a
sounding kiss). Still stooping, KATE!
Kate. CHARLES! (.Rising.)
Charles (hissing her again). Ah, KATK,
KATE, what a charming little creature
you are, and how much I love you!
Kate. Dut how long will you go on
loving me?
Cluirles. Always, dearest—in a cap and
apron. (Embraces her.)
Kate. It's rather hard that I should
have to remain a housemaid permanently
in order to retain my husband's affection.
Charles (seriously). It is, dear. I see
that.
Kafc. However, there 's nothing to be
done, so I may as well accustom myself
to the idea as soon as possible. (Tofces a
broom and begins to sweep the floor.) Yon
don't think your absurd shyness is likely
to diminish with time?
Charles. It may, dear. But I think it
would be unwise to count upon it. No,
as far as 1 can see, the only thing to bo
done is for you to continue in your pre-
sent occupation—you sweep charmingly—
for the rest of your natural life.
Kafe (sweeping industriously). What
would my father say if he saw me!
Charles (easily). He won't sec you. He
hasn't been over since wo were married.
[A ring is heard.
Kate (starting). Who's that?
Cliarles. What does it matter? No one
will be shown in here. JENKINS has orders
never to bring visitors into my room.
Kate. That's true. (.Returns to her
siveeping).
'Suddenly the door opens and Mr. HARD-
CASTLE enters, with elaborate hearti-
ness, thrusting aside JENKINS who
vainly tries to Jceep him out.
Hardcastfe. Zounds, man, out of the
way! Don't talk to me about the parlour.
Can't I come and see my son-in-law in any
room I choose?
^CHARLES mutters an oath; KATE stands,
clutching her broom conwulsu'ely, facing
her father.
Hardcastle (boisterously). How d 'ye do,
son-in-law? KATE, my dear, give me a
kiss. Heavens, child, don't stand there
clinging to a broomstick as though you
were going to fly away with it. Come and
kiss your old father.
[KATE drops the broom nervously and kisses
him obediently.

OUR CHILDREN'S LETTER.
(We freely acknou)ledge that this idea is
suggested by many popular lady's papers.)
MY DEAR LITTLE READERS,—Hero is^ a
letter written especially for you. I want
you all to write me a nice letter in return,
telling me what you think of this charming
paper. You see, we try all sorts of.'artful
dodges to sell it. And we do sell so many
—millions and millions every week. You
must call me Auntie BERTHA. What a
difficult name BERTHA is. Perhaps Auntie
BLUFFER is easier. I hope all my little
readers have a money-box. If not, you
must ask mamma to buy you one; and all
the pennies you save during the week you
will put in your money-box; and when
Saturday comes, you will have quite a lot
of pennies to spend on copies of this dear
little paper. I 'm sure it is your favourite
one. We all work so hard in this great
big office to make it better than any other
paper in the world. Of course you will
not keep all the copies yourself. My
little chicks must not be selfish. No;
you will ask nurse to take yon round in
the pram; and you will leave a copy at
every house all round where you live.
Then wo shall sell more copies |of this
paper and grow very rich. Won't that be
fun—for us! And when you have bought
and given away five hundred copies of
your favourite little paper, you must write
and tell Auntie BLUFFER. And I shall send
each of my kind little helpers a beautifully-
dressed doll, costing quite two whole
bright shillings. Isn't that a lot of
money? I hope the little boys and girls
mamma lets you play with are very good
—and buy our paper every week. Does
your kind papa know wo publish a paper
for big men—every Wednesday? It costs
six-and-six, post free, and is so clever.
Of course my chicks will tell grandmamma
all about our Sunday papers.
Now I 'm going to tell you a little story:
There was once an egg born in a warm,
soft nest in the country. It was such a
nice little fresh egg. I 'm quite sure my
little London readers have no idea how
fresh a little egg can be. Well, it grew
discontented at being in the pure and
beautiful country, and longed for the
great town; not knowing what a dread-
ful place it is. So it got put in a big
wooden box, and came to London. And it
went to a grocer's shop, and lay all day in
the box watching the people passing to
and fro. And, Oh, the sights it saw!
Well, after a few weeks of town life it felt
it was losing its freshness, and the grocer
felt so too, and put a big card over it on
which was written "SELECTED." It was
just as well the egg could not read. And
when months and months went by and
nobody bought it, it longed for the
country, for the dreadful air of London
made it so unhappy. Indeed, it knew too
well how London life had made it, quite a
bad little egg. But one day a maid came
and bought it, and the bad little egg
thought it was going into a nice pudding.
But when the cook broke its shell she
knew at once what a thoroughly bad little
egg it was, and she said "Pugh!" and
threw it into the dustbin. And that was
the end'of the discontented egg.
And the MORAL is: London is not the
place for a fresh egg.
And now, my chicks, I must stop. So
buy-buy—I mean bye-bye.
From your pence-loving,
Auntie BLUFFER.
Isn't this a nice, artless letter?
'VARSITY VERSES.
OXFORD ODES.
V.
WHEN first with studious guide-book I
To learn the colleges would try,
When John's I thought was in the High,
And Queen's was mixed with Oriel,
When bull-dogs, in my verdant view,
To fierce and four-legged monsters
grew,
Then first my glances fell on you,
Mysterious Memorial.
I wondered whose the praise you sung,
With eloquent yet silent tongue —
Some village Hampden that had wrung
From Stewart tyrants charters,
Some Cromwell guiltless — vide GRAY —
Some England's Alf — I turned away,
And in my guide-book read that they
Were called the Oxford Martyrs.
The Oxford Martyrs? I had read
Of none; and as I laid my head,
Much wondering, upon my bed,
Behold, my troubled slumbers
Were filled with visions: first advanced
A troop of dons, who round me danced,
Greek chorus-like, the while entranced
I listened to their numbers:
"The martyrs are those who lecture on
proso
To pupils whose Latin is not CICERO'S;
Who are doomed to teach Greek
Six days in tho week
To youths to whom Plato is Greek, Heaven
knows.
"Who are fated — ah, me !— to make the
blind see
The delicate beauties of syntax — e.g.,
The grammatical plan
Of the particle He,
And the force of pi ov as compared with
The wailing strophe died away,
Another band took up the lay;
All undergraduates were they
Who moved in mournful fashion.
Sad figures, pitiful to see,
And as they danced in front of me,
They sang their sad antistrophe
With scarce concealed passion:
"The Martyrs are those who are taught
to write prose
In a style that old CICERO out-Ciceroes,
Who are doomed to submit
To the insolent wit
Of a tutor who sneers at the little one
knows.
"Who are fated — woe, woe I — never, never
to know
The delicate bea utics of syntax, which show
That all particles must
Their vagaries adjust
To dicta of RUTHERFORD, GOODWIN,
MONRO."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL
MR. MIFFIN'S ADVENTURE.
MR. MIFFIN re-filled his glass for the
fifth timo. Not to havo done so would
have argued criminal mis-apprecintion of
'51 port. And nrxt to the study of Ori-
ental metaphysics caino old bottled port
in Mr. MIFFIS'S estimation. Indeed, his
essay on "Decantering considered as one
of the fine arts" had reccited possibly
more favour from his fellow clubmen than
his esoteric discourse on "Transmigra-
tional Transcendentalism."
But make no mistake! Mr. MIFFIN was
not dining at his club.
On the contrary, he was lunching at
home in Bayswater, and the point is of
some importance, as may be seen from
subsequent events.
Before lunch, Mr. MIFFIN had suffered
^certain conscientious pangs as to the
desirability of taking this sacred vintage
in the middle of the day. But you must
combat a north-east wind in some way,
and perhaps it is better, after being
buffeted about in the open, to run to
port.
After lunch, Mr. MIFFIN felt no qualms
whatever. He even viewed the cold slush
outside with a genial smile. Then he
ruminated on his pet theory, " The Trans-
migration of Souls," illustrating his own
views—to himself—by means of the cork.
A sudden twinge put an end to a very
elaborate argument, and the conscience
of Mr. MIFFIN awoke with a jerk. "I'll
go out," said he ; and out he went.
A man was standing near one of the
gates of the Park. Ho was shabbily
dressed, and would have attracted no
notice had not Mr. MIFFIN caught these
remarkable words as he passed: "The
ivnj walls of Rome Imue ears. Nero hath
spies everywhere." Was the man mad?
What did he know of Rome? What—could
it be——? Oh, joy! Mr. MIFFIN almost
broke, his umbrella in his excitement.
There, perhaps, was the individual whom
he had sought for years—one who remem-
bered his previous existence! Doubtless
this poor wretch was once a citizen of the
Great Empire. He must speak to him.
At first the man seemed surprised, then
an odd expression came into his face, and
he told'Mr. MIFFIN that he remembered,
not only Ancient Rome, but Egypt and
many Eastern countries. Once, indeed,
lie could swear he had been a rich mer-
chant in Bagdad. Possibly, if Mr. MIFFIN
had not been so carried away by
enthusiasm, he might have been more
sceptical. But he was naturally a trustful
man, and '51 port is not compatible with
scepticism.
He made an appointment with the man
for the following day, and rushed home to
write a paper that should startle the
world.
Alas I that the world should havo been
deprived of this pleasure by the insig-

Mabel. "WELL, IT is KIND OF YOU, FHEDDIE DEAR, TO ALLOW MB TO DRIVE; AND
WHEN WE ARE MARRIED I HOPE YOU WILL CONTINUE ALLOWING HE TO DO SO."
Freddie. "AYELL—I DON'T KNOW, DARLINO. I THINK, MABEL DEAR, WHEN THAT TIME
COMI8, I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE THE REINS OCCASIONALLY MYSELF."
nificaut fact that a shabby-
looking man never turned up
at the house of Mr. MIFFIN.
So Mr. MIFFIN could not write
his paper. Nevertheless, ho
talks very freely at the Club
about his adventure, and how
the man had, perhaps, been
too frightened to come, or
been killed, etc.
By a queer coincidence, on
that very day when Mr. MlF-
FIN encountered this living
illustration of his pre-exis-
tence theory, a new "super"

in Tlte Sign of the Cross at one
of the suburban theatres. He
had been wandering about the
park on this afternoon, and
met (so he after averred) a
strange old cove with whom
he had a joke. Previously he
had taken part in the panto-
mime of .Hi Hiiim.
And the remarkable thing
is that his fellow-actors dis-
believe his story just as the
Club - men disbelieve Mr.
MIFFIN.
This fact, as the moralist
says, gives food for reflection.

THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A GREAT TBOUGUT FOR EVERY DAY IN TUB YEAR.
SRCOND SERIES.
H.—THE AMATORY CORRESPONDENCE SECTION.
(With aclmmi'lcngments to the gentleman who is reputed to have
composed "An Englishwoman's Love-Letters.")
Mr DEAR A PAT,—I am about to send you a lieavy latch of love-
letters. Do not be shocked. I recognise that we are within the
prohibited degrees. They are only female love-letters made out of
my head. You will understand that I have disguised my sex;
reversing, out of deference to modern feeling, the process of
GEOROB ELIOT and others. I was naturally tempted to colZ my
work "The Love-betters of Elizabeth," that name being noui
almost de rigueur in the trade; but I liave been content to say
"An Englishwoman lias done this tiling." You might be good
enough to get them published for me, and affix a preface (in a
different style from tliat of the .letters) saying, (1) that they
were originally sacred and meant for the eyes of One Only; (2)
t/i(it the author is dead; (3) tluit exceptional circumstances have
arisen, &c.; and (4) anything else that may occur to you as likely
to intrigud the public. I am sending them to you because you
are the only woman that I know at all well whose handivriting is
at once feminine and legible. This is necessary for imposing on
a publislier's innocence. I sliall trust you to emend anything than
strikes you as too unladylike; and, in the hope tliat you will
kindly remit profits to me at the old address, I sign myself,
Your ever anonymous NEPHEW.
FEBRUARY 1st.—BRIGHTEST AND BEST,—This is the first of a
long and steady series of love-letters that are to come from my
swelling heart. Need I say that they are not for publication?
No eye but yours, not even your butler's, must ever see
them. I have a trunk full of letters of responsive love, written
daily during the weary six months of our blossoming friendship.
Each was ready stamped at the time, in case your proposal
arrived before the bag went out. And now, at last, at last, I
have hooked you. Dear fish! and you are man enough to
imagine the victory yours! See, I give my sex away, and am
too glad to blush! I never blush now. Till to-morrow.
Your Compleat Angler.
*SRD.—MOST THOROUGHLY BELOVED,—Had you an egg for
breakfast? I had. I take a new and absorbing interest in
myself, now that I am part of you! As a child I have been
radiantly happy over mud pies. I must believe now that some-
where your dear hands were contemporaneously busy with the
same luscious compound. Otherwise the joy I then had is
inexplicable. I was to tell you of a wasp on my window-sill,
and a new dress, also with a sting in its tail, into whose making I
have put all my lovo for yon, and how I saw a rabbit, during the
transit of Venus, sucking dandelions on the lawn; but I am so
fearful that you will look for mysteries between the. lines, and
despair of following me. My brain is a dazzle of diamond
facets, while yours is a pure carbuncle, and like the Blenheim
skull that woke wonder in little PETERKIN as being "so large
and smooth and round." Your ever amorous.
CTH.—OWN,—Shall we give each other names from the stars,
that we may wink together when apart? Yes? Then I will bo
Virgo, and you shall be the Great Bear that hugs me. It is my
birthday, and you did not know! Somehow, I could not tell you:
so strange a thing is a really nice woman's reserve.
CTH.—MOST PATIENT,—The post has this moment gone with my
letter, finished just in time. So I sit down to begin another.
I could go on writing without a break except for meals; but
pity is at the heart of my love.
7TH.—LOVELIEST,—You have won the right to know rny past.
I will not withhold from you that an intermittent fever, some-
thing like nettle-rash, used to possess me when I dreamed
of one day being a maker of books. Now that I have
you, I have no care for a larger public. And, indeed, it is a
man's career. For woman there is lovo and there is beauty.
My heart is my warrant for the one; for the other, it ripens
daily in my mirror. Happy Mercury! though perhaps it is for
you, rather than me, to say it. Please say it.
OTH.—MY STAR, MY GREAT BEAR,—I have your very own
letter acknowledging my six last, which sopm to have arrived
by consecutive posts. You ask mo if I do not weary myself,
and whether I could not eontrivV to say a little less. Dear
Altruist! I do not, and I could not, if I tried. Your
importunate.
IOTH.—ABSENT YET PRESENT,—"What, what is this of your
sickness, and me not by to touch the spot? To think that you
should be laid up with " servant's knee!" Why, it is I, who
am one large genuflexion at your feet, that should suffer in
that sort. Do not fear tliat I should love you less, though both
your knees should perish utterly. You are you, and cannot
essentially change. I send you BROWNING'S Jocoseria for a love-
potion. Your NANA (not ZOLA'S, but meaning your Nurse that
would be). *
llTH.—POOR, POOR,—So the medicine was worse than the
disease, and the " servant's knee" has given place to a strain
in your dear mind? It was thoughtless to send you BROWNING,
when yon were too weak to bear him. Be appeased, beloved!
Where your mother has failed, it will take something more than
BROWNING to sever us. Here is BAEDEKER in his stead, that you
may picture me in Italy, for which I start next week. My body,
that is, for my spirit will bestride your pillow. In Paradise,
I think, there will be no side-saddles. Ever your astral.
13TH.—Never doubt me, dearest. I would not dream of setting
up my opinion against yours. I have seen your mother but once;
you must have met her far, far, oftener. But then, I think, she
could never have accused you, even tacitly, of suffering from
hereditary madness. Here, quite humbly, I have the advantage
of you in my experience of her. Forgive my presumption;
you know how easily I would lay down my life for you at the
first soitpcon of your wish that way. When will you put mo to
the test? To-morrow? Then it must be by the morning post,
as we leave in the afternoon for the Continent, where my
address is uncertain. Moribunda te saluto.
15TH.—DEAREST INNOMINATO,—You have my letters, one from
Dover, two from the Calais buffet, and a post-card from each
end of the St. Gothard Tunnel? Arno is under me as I write.
The architecture of Florence is aldermanic: it glorifies the
municipal idea. One misses the reach-me-up of the soaring
Gothic. I am just back from the Academia delle Belle Arti-
(You don't mind my spelling it with only one c? It is a
weakness I cannot conquer.) I thought I knew my LIPPO
of the prim Madonnas, that so belie the known levity of their
model. But one has first to see his " Coronation," where his
own portrait shows most profane among "the flowery, bowery
angel-brood," beside the brazen " little lily-thing " who makes
apology for his intrusion (and hers, too, for that matter) with
her unanswerable " Iste pcrjei-.it opus." Lucky " St. Lucy"!
If I were Florentine, and not, as you know, an Englishwoman
abroad, engaged to be married, and could choose from all this
city's centuries a man to love, certainly this same LIPPO should
have my heart.
"Floorer o' the broom,
Take away love aud our earth is a tomb."
Whoever—it should not be Lucrezia's half-souled DEL SARTO,
though he does get more atmosphere into his work than most
of them. How BROWNING has made these dead bones live for
us with his touch of Fancy, re-creating Fact! But I forgot;
you begged me, as I loved you, not to mention him. Yet he,
* NOTE.— The artificial arrangement of the dates of these letters is
governed by the length and magnitude of the thoughts which they contain.
It does no sort of justice to the admirable' frequency of their despatch.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
The Expert in Handwriting.
BY A. L.
I.
OFTEN I have •wondered •whether there is any truth in the
remark that the nonsense knocked out of people at school is, at
Oxford, carefully and painlessly put back. It was at Oxford
that HARVEY—my husband—formed his friendship for WYVERN
MAUNDER. WYVERN is a "nice boy," a "dear fellow," or a
"good chap," according to people's age and point of view. If
he is a trifle better looking than the average, he has neither
any sort of pose nor any " views," nor, indeed, anything likely
to irritate his fellow men. He is consequently popular, parti-
cularly with women; and they probably know how enormously
popular they are with him. It is not the sort of thing a man
like WYVERN would conceal from them. In fact, he is strangely
susceptible, and I have never met him yet when he was not,
more or less, desperately in love. Theoretically, he is what
I believe used to be called a Pessimist, and never sees the
slightest glimmer of a silver lining without promptly calling
attention to the lowering cloud. But this does not in the
least interfere with his spirits, which are quite abnormally
high. Oar friendship has always consisted chiefly in our con-
fiding in each other enthusiastically on matters of no impor-
tance whatsoever, and giving to each other, simultaneously,
excellent advice, to which neither even pretended to listen.
I talked to him about everything under the sun. His own
subject never varied.
However, after a time, I listened less eagerly to the com-
fortable sorrows of the sentimentalist. But he still continued
to write to me with some frequency, assuming his confidences
to be no less interesting than before. It would, however, be
most unfair to accuse him, in this matter, of indiscretion.
WYVERN MACNDER'B epistolary communications were liable to
remain as profound a secret from his correspondent as from the
rest of the world. Clear and intelligible in conversation, on
paper he became a dark, unfathomable mystery. As a matter
of fact, no one had as yet been discovered who could read a
single word of his handwriting.
One day I received a letter from him, written apparently,
as usual, in bad Arabic, with the handle rather than the
point of the pen. From the shape of the letter I thought
it did not seem to require an answer, and I had grown acciu-
tomed to judging by appearances in these mattters. I therefore
took no notice of it, although it looked a little blacker, the
words were larger and yet closer together, and altogether it
seemed more interesting than usual. But our friendship was
growing fainter. Besides, I was going to Tunbridge Wells for
Easter by an early train with little GLADYS (HARVKY was to join
me the next day), and also I had something on my mind that
made me rather absent at the time.
HARVEY had risen late, and I went to say goodbye to him, not
at all liking to leave him even for a day. Then, as I went
down and saw his breakfast ready in the dining-room, I found
the letter in my pocket; so I put it on his plate, think-
ing it might amuso him to try to decipher "old WYVERN'S
scrawl," and went off with GLADYS and her governess to
Tunbridge Wells. I was thoughtful.
In the autumn I had seen a palmist known as the Wonderful
Mrs. HOPKINSON, who assured me, with the absolute certainty
of the mistaken, that a man with the initials A. H.' would
"come into my life " and " in the early spring " would "save
me from a terrible danger." For a time I was sceptical. Yet,
as I met, in steady succession, ANTHONY HOPE, ARTHUR HU.M-
. FHEYS, ANDRE HELIOFFALOVICH, Lord ALFRED HAVERLBY and
AXGY HAZLER, and when neither of them appeared to shew any
desire to come into my life I felt disappointed. The only one
who certainly did take a little trouble at one time was ALGY
JAZLER, and I am bound to say that if ono luid to bo saved from
a danger ALGY II \/i 1:1; would have been the person I should
»avo chosen to do it.
But, after meeting him, and discovering his good qualities—
and his initials—at a dinner-party, after seeing him accidentally
at the theatre and on purpose in the Park, ho confided in me
;hat he was "privately engaged" to a dear girl down in
Jertfordshire.
Privately engaged indeed! People with the appearance of
Mr. ALGERNON HAZLER ought to have the decency to be publicly
engaged, and they ought to wear a notice to that effect. Not
;hat it mattered ; what, in Heaven's name, had it to do with me!
However, it was spring; there appeared to be no dangers
about, and that absurd ALGY (I never liked him really) had gone
to spend Easter " down in Hertfordshire."
GLADYS, Miss MILLS and I wandered about the Common,
bought for each other paper-knives of curious Tunbridge ware,
and GLADYS presented us each with a shell pincushion, demand-
ing first the money to pay for these useful gifts.
The next morning I received a telegram, of which this is
an accurate copy:—
To Mrs. Wentioorth, Tiles Hotel, Mount Sebastian, Tun-
bridge Wells.—AH discovered Never return to my roof Am
communicating solely through solicitor Harvey Basset Went-
worth.
Naturally I felt horribly upset and bewildered, and, of
course, I simply hadn't a notion of what it could mean. The
more I read it aloud to Miss MILLS, and the more she read it
aloud to me, the less we both understood it. In the shadow of
the Toad Rock I took the resolution to ask HARVEY what was
the matter. I went indoors, when another telegram was given
to me at the hotel. It ran thus:—
Come at once to Chiltern Court Witt meet you station
Bring Gladys and Mills Hope arrange all right, but must tell
us everything Love from Violet—Cluirleij.
'This was, if possible, a greater puzzle than the last. The
only obvious thing was that we must leave the Tiles Hotel
at once.
Our journey from Tunbridge Wells to my cousin's country
house remains a ghastly blank in my memory. I believe that
even Miss MILLS—and certainly GLADYS, who is five—would,
if they had been informed of it all, have doubted my utter
ignorance of the trouble.
CHARLEY and VIOLET, my greatest friends, are a delightful
young married couple. CHARLEY—well, I think that ought to
be enough. Everyone knows what a CHARLEY is like. He was
exceptional only in being still fonder of sport of all kinds than
most CHARLEYS (particularly for shooting with an air-gun at
cats).
At the little station at Chiltern we saw CHARLEY.
"BEATRICE, get up here. Miss MILLS and GLADYS can go
in the carriage ;'' and in two minutes I was being whirled
along on a high dog-cart, side by side with CHARLEY, who at
once began.
"Well, you 've been making a nice mess of it I"
"CHARLEY," I implored, "what is it all about?"
"Oh, BEATRICE, hang it!" he answered in a tone of despair,
"do shut up that sort of thing, or I can't be the least use.
VIOLET and I '11 stick to you, if you '11 tell us everything."
"But I don't know anything!"
"Yon're enough to irritate a saint I Listen. HARVEY came

and then, if I could send him a satisfactory explanation of the
letter, to come down and give you a chance of explaining."
"tetter! What letter?"
"You know all right!"
"I don't."
"HARVEY found on his breakfast-table, after yon left, a love-
letter"
I started.
"A love-letter. The servants say you put it there yourself—
though I shouldn't have thought even you would be quite
capable of that; but perhaps you did?"
"Oh, my dear CHARLIE," I cried radiantly, clapping my hands
•with joy. "Of coarse I did! Is that all? Why, I can explain
it easily! It's all right. It's a mistake. I '11 convince
HARVEY. He's jealons, then, and of"
"Of MAUNDER, confound him! I always thought lie was a
doceut chap, too. I can tell you, though, BEATRICE, you 've
got to stop this bosh—for, of course, it is bosh."
"No, it isn't," I cried eagerly, "not even bosh.' It isn't
anything! Don't you see? WYVERN is madly in love with
somebody else, and he confides in me. Oh, CHARLIE, I 'm so
relieved! Of course, no one can read his handwriting, and
HARVEY must have made a mistake."
"Thank goodness! That's all right, then. I '11 wire HARVEY
something that will bring him down to-morrow morning; and
now, do cheer up and make the best of it."
II.
AFTER anight of suspense, I was waiting in the little Japa-
nese room to see HARVEY. I heard his voice. He had arrived!
1 was horribly nervous. He came in, shut the door and stood
iu front of it.
I said, "Dearest HARVEY, how could you be so absurd"
and I held out both my hands. HARVEY put his behind his
back as though I were a child, and he had a present for me,
and I was to guess what it was. So I did the same, though it
seemed a silly game. Then he said:
"Now, BEATRICE, it's useless trying to humbug me. I
insist on a plain answer to a plain question."
He then produced the letter from WYVERN I had left on the
table, and asked me to read it.
Anything so entirely unintelligible, I never saw.
"What's this, HARVEY, about 'Don't laugh at me as a
humorous swine'?"
"Rubbish I It's 'Don't laugh at me as an amorous swain.'"
1 was sure of my version, but stumbled on—'"You know
little, so far, of these liver pills.'"
"' Lovers' ills '!" shouted HARVEY. "It's no use wasting
time on this. I have copied out the essential part—the part
that opened my eyes," and he gave me a paper in his own clear
handwriting. This is what I read:
"You are (thet) soul of my existence, you dear woman, and
our love is our life. He is frivolous and hateful, and we may
(word undecipherable) tell the fool to go hang."
I was appalled at first. Could WYVERN have gone off his
head, and really written this nonsense?
"Did you really find this in the letter?"
"Yes. I tell you that, taking it with the rest, I understood it.
I thought at first it was a code, or something, but I soon saw it
was plain English."
"Plain English I But it doesn't make sense—and WYTBRN
doesn't make love. Oh, believe me I"
"Silence 1 If you like, we '11 go through the letter together.
I wish to be just."
What on earth could "He is frivolous and liatefitl"
mean? Why should HARVEY suppose it to refer to him? We
went through it, and fought the letter word by word, till
my brain whirled. One sentence 1 read, "I bought a shutter
on the Alps," which HARVEY perversely declared was " I sought
a shelter in your arms." It was endless and maddening, until
I had a bright idea. Ask WYVERN! HARVEY scorned it, saying
the idiotic fool would be sure to have some damned clever
rotten explanation, and so wo went on, ho reproaching bitterly,
I denying and crying, until I suddenly said:
"Listen, HARVEY. I am certain WYVERN would not write
to me in that strain, but I '11 make this suggestion. Go to
an expert in handwriting, and I '11 abide by his decision!"
And HARVEY agreed, seeming struck with the idea. After
grumbling a little more, and a few words with CHARLIE and
VIOLET, he consented to gq back to town and see an expert.
He refused to stay to lunch, and went by the 12.45, provi-
sionally cold and civil in manner.
In the afternoon our troubles were over. The following
telegram arrived:
"Everything all right. Too sorry for words. Expert's explana-
tion follows by post. Will come and fetch you to-morrow
morning. Love.—HARVEY .''
And by the evening post I received the expert's version of
the important sentences. It ran thus:
"I am quick at making verses, and have finished the play in an
hour. It is possible and probable that I shall bring it out as
soon as I can get a man to go shares."
"I suppose," HARVEY wrote, "that dear old WYVERN lias
written a play, and hasn't enough money to get it produced
himself. If he can't find a capitalist, I 'm going to back him
up. Forgive me, darling."
******
The next day wo went back happy, though I still had an un-
easy belief that WYVERN must have been writing to me about
some woman—and I was quite certain he would as soon write a
play in an hour as a year; also that he was not "quick at
making verses." We wore talking it over when WYVERN came
in, and I signed to him to say nothing when HARVEY discussed
it with him.
HARVEY put down WYVEIIN'S smiling silence, awkward looks,
and apparent entire ignorance of the subject, title, or style
of his play, to shyness, and went out, leaving us together, to
show his renewed confidence.
Then WYVERN read me his own, real, original, and genuine
version of the letter. The fatal sentences ran as follows:
"I am sick of dancing attendance on that woman, and can bear
it no more. She is frivolous and heartless, and I shall go to
Nonuaij to fish as soon as I can get a pal to go too."
Since this happened, the only result of any importance is
that WYVERN has learnt type-writing. Certainly, the expert
did get one or two of the unimportant words right—which
was rather clever of him.
Here are the three versions side by side :—
Husband's Version.
"You are (the)
soul of ray exist-
ence, you dear
woman, and our love
is our life. He is
frivolous and hate-
ful, and we may"
(word undecipher-
able) "tell the fool
to go hang."
Expert's Version.
"I'm quick at ma-
king verses, and
have finished the
play in an hour. It
is possible and pro-
bable that I shall
bring it out as soon
as I can get a man
to go shares."
Genuine Version.
"I'm sick of dan-
cing attendance ion
that woman, and can
bear it no more.
She is frivolous and
heartless, and I shall
go to Norway to flsh
as soon as I can get
a pal to go too."
And, wasn't it extraordinary? I asked HARVBY the name of
the expert, and it's AUGUSTUS HENDERSON—A. H., you know!

MAN'S PLACE IN NATURE.
(According to the Emancipated Lady
Journalist.)
THERE was a rustle of silk skirts, a
delicate odour of the latest fashion in
perfume, a metallic jangling of chatelaine
appurtenances, and the lady journalist
swept into tho sanctum of
her chief -with all the gush
and ardour of her kind.
The Editor, a nervous,
overworked gentleman, with
a habit of strained polite-
ness, saluted his fair visitor,
and timidly picking up a
long "pull," known in his
profession asa " galley slip,"
ran his eyes its length adown
and addressed the lady:
"Your report of the DE
JONES -wedding," he said.
The Lady Journalist grew
sympathetically interested.
"It's very good," he re-
marked, in tones that hardly
carried conviction with
them. "'This afternoon,'
you write, 'at St. George's,
Hanover Square, the mar-
riage took place of Miss
CYNTHIA GWENDOLEN DE
JONES. Tho church was
beautfully decorated with
palms and white azaleas.
The service, which was fully
choral, was very greatly im-
proved by the able conduct-
ing of Mr. THUMPLETON, tho
organist of the DE JONES'
parish church.'"
"Yes," acquiesced she.
"'The bride," " continued
the Editor, "'was given
away by her brother. She
looked exceedingly well in
her wedding gown. It was
made of cream satin, and
was in every way a triumph
of art, etc., etc.' Here you
devote four lines to a des-
cription of the costume."
"Yes; I had to condense
it, knowing how valuable
your space is."
"Then you take four moro
lines for the full court train,
with an additional two for
for the veil. Three more for
the jewels, another for ornaments, another
for the bouquet."
"I thought it well to have these im-
portant facts quite accurate."
"Certainly. There were six brides-
maids, I notice. You give their names in
full, with their relationship to the bride.
Then four, six, eight, nine lines—no less
—yon devote to their costumes, with two
supernumerary lines for their jewels and
bouquets."
"Yes," said the lady journalist, archly.
"It's the usual thing, isn't it?"
"Quite," said the Editor. "Then comes
a concise account of the bride's travelling-
dress, and the usual remarks about tho
presents," and he handed the proof to her.
She smiled very sweetly as she thanked him.
"Now I want you to glance over it,"
ful imperturbability, "I felt that one or
two minor details had escaped my obser-
vation."

Never was there such a

TWELFTH-NIGHT CHARACTERS.
THE success achieved by Mr. TREE'S production of Twelfth
\ig/it, is primarily duo to a charmingly nai've Viola, as rendered
ijy Miss LILY BKAYTON, to the love-sick nobleman Or.iino,
made as manly as possible by Mr. ROBERT TABEB (looking
occasionally like Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, and acting and
speaking so like Mr. HERMAN VRZIN that between the two
resemblances the puzzle is to find TABER), to Mr. LIONEL
BROUGH'S jolly old roystering Uncle Toby, combining forces
with the irresistibly absurd Sir Andrew of Mr. NORMAN
FORBES, and the mischievous, buxom housekeeper, Maria
(afterwards My Lady Toby, and therefore aunt by marriage to
the proud Olivia—how delighted this lady will be !—but what
did this matter to rollicking WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE !) as played
by Miss ZEVFIK TILBURY, to Festo, the musical fool, as jauntily
represented by Mr. COURTICE POUNDS, whose songs were
encored, everyone of them, and who never acted better than
in this difficult part; and to Mr. TREE'S perfectly self-satisfied,
pompous, unconsciously idiotic Maleolio, an immortal illustration
of the swollen-headed official. It is one of his very cleverest
impersonations: admirable. His only fault is a rather too
evident consciousness of his own humour.
This is the first list of the Twelfth Niglit " characters," who,
placed as they have been by Mr. HAWES CRAVEN in a perfect
paradise called "Olivia's Garden" (loudly and most justly
acclaimed by tho crowded audience), gaily carry the piece to
the goal of success, taking the audience with them. On the
second list there is Mr. COOKSON as an excellent melodramatic
Sea Captain, Miss MAUD JEFFRIES as a rather too Lady Mac-
bethian Countess Olii'ia, and Mr. QUARTERMAIN in that most
madly in love at first sight and politely to consent to marry
off-hand a lady of whom he knows nothing at all, and has never
seen before, and all this in a space of a few dozen lines, of which
none are of any particular importance! Bravo, Sebastian!
Tho finish is charming and thoroughly Shakspcarian. Tho
romantic extravaganza is finished, tho prismatic coloured
bubble has vanished into thin air, and only the Fool remains
on the stage to give one .'little demi-somiquavcr of a note
on his pipe and cast a knowing glance at the audience, as who
would say, "This is such stuff as dreams arc made of "—
"But that's all one
Our play is dune,
And we '11 strive to please you every day."
Yes, the Fool sounds the true note at the finish, and all pre-
sent could dream this dream again for which the run will offer,
it is most probable, many opportunities between the start and
finish of the season. Music, including Sir ALEXANDER MAC-
KENZIE'S overture, written long ago, not specially for this
occasion, charming.
DUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN his Shylock of the River (DiOBY, LONO & Co.) Mr. FERGUS
HUME gives us a sensational story with the wrongfully sus-
pected but, of course, utterly innocent hero, the wicked
woman, the suffering heroine, and the villain, all in their
proper places, and all worked in the same old accustomed
fashion up to a certain point, when suddenly "things take •.<.
turn," the novel-reader's curiosity is aroused, he pulls himsuif
together and finds that this is, "after all said and done," an
uncommonly ingenious and novel plot. Worth reading, mind
you, for the plot's sake, not for the writing which runs into
wearisome dialogue. The criminally-disposed twins, Tweedle-
dum and Tweedle-dce gone wrong, are a decidedly original
invention. "FERGUS HUME," quoth the Baron, "with all thy
faults I am partial to you still," and he recommends this book
to those who follow the Baron.
I would give half-a-dozen of SHAKSPEARE'S plays for one of
the prefaces he ought to have written." Thus Mr. BERNARD
SHAW when introducing, as he frankly says, from the cart with
the trumpet, his Three Plays for Puritans (GRANT RICHARDS).
The three plays are excellent. But my Baronite will give them
all for the preface. Nothing so sublimely egotistic has ap-
peared in print since Mr. SHAW last wrote on a subject always
to him alluring. Part of the attraction of reading the pages
lies in the dubiety as to whether he has his tongue in his
cheek throughout the performance, or whether he is really as
enamoured of himself as he professes. There is a limit to his
self-esteem. "Better than SHAKSPEARK?" is the enquiry
prefixed to the final study of himself. He shrinks from the
definite affirmative, but boldly asserts his right to profess to
have " something to say by this time that neither HOMER nor
SHAKSPEAREsaid." He certainly has. Whether it is all subtle
fooling or hopeless folly, it is decidedly entertaining. But Mr.
SHAW does not immediately remind my Uaronite of either
HOMER or SHAKSPEARE.
The Oxford University Press is always up to date. Within
ten days of the Accession of King EDWARD, Mr. HENRY FROWDE
had out copies of the amended Book of Common Prayer. It
contains a copy of the Royal Warrant for the new Accession
Service, issued by the King's command two days' before the
book was offered to the public. As is the custom of the Uni-
versity Press,- it is issued in various forms to suit divers parses.
All are excellently printed; some beautifully bound. Mj
Baronite notes that the prayer for the Royal Family, where, of
late, the Prince and Princess of WALES prominently figured
difficult of all the parts to look and act, namely, Sebastian, a
gawky, raw-boned looking lad, who is constrained to appear as | now beseeches for blessing upon "GEORGE, Duke of CORNWALL
much as possible like his twin-sister Viola (and she is bound to | and YORK, the Duchess of CORNWALL and YORK." By-and-bye

CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG RIDERS.
CHAP. VII.
Of Mr. Jorrocks and his creator—0} Verdant Green and Cuthbert
Bede—Of Whyte Melville—Of the "Edinburgh Review."
THERE is no more important part of the conversational
equipment of a young sportsman than a knowledge of sporting
history and literature. To know all about Mr. Jorrocks and
his exploits is something, for Mr. Jorrocks is to hunting what
Afr. Verdant Green is to university life, a tradition, an en-
couragement, an example and an absurdity. The man who can
quote his Jorrocks in the field, or at any convivial gathering of
sportsmen, will never lack the tribute of appreciative laughter.
What Afr. Jorrocks did, or said, or thought; how he bore
himself in all the vicissitudes of his career, how he was now
own to supplement possible deficiencies in his biography. But
if it were shown that he had never been on a horse, the fact
would not be more surprising than the undoubted fact that
CUTHBERT BEDE, the author of Verdant Green, was an under-
graduate, not of Oxford, but of Durham University. Whither
have vanished all the pale imitations of the immortal Verdant?
Of Mr. Golightty, the Cambridge Freshman, a stray copy is,
perhaps, sold here and there to an unsuspecting Cantab, but
Verdant, whose author was a Durham man, still holds his own
in edition after edition, at Cambridge no less than at Oxford.
Habent sua fata libelli.
In the meantime, O my young friend, let mo commend to
your notice a delightful article on " The Early History of Fox-
Hunting," in the latest issue of the Edinburgh Review. I can
see your start of surprise. What, you ask, has this great

crafty and now bold, how he lectured and ate and drank and
slept and roistered and rode—these are the topics that have
brightened the lives and tickled the ribs of successive
generations of hunting men, and seem likely to provide their
descendants, in the future, with a no less generous fund of
anecdote and amusement. Of Mr. Jorrocks, then, you hear
constantly, and more will be said of him in this series; but of
the author of his being, Mr. SURTEES—the creator, too, of a
whole gallery of vivid sporting characters whose deeds are
alive in the mouths of men who ride—little or nothing is known.
He wrote his books, ho lived his life, death long ago claimed
him, and there his history ends. And it is perhaps his
greatest glory that by the mere force of his animal spirits
and his gift of lively description he should have stamped
his fat cockney shopkeeper, Jorrocks, upon the minds of
sportsmen as the type and exemplar of a sportsman. Was
SURTBES himself a hunting man? It is a horrid doubt; I do
not speak by the book, and have no private knowledge of my
quarterly—the jousting place of MACAULAY, and innumerable
other protagonists of politics and literature—what has it to
do with sport, and how shall a sporting novice profit by read-
ing its severe and solemn pages? Softly, good youth, softly.
Remember, that in all ages literature and sportsmanship have
gone hand in hand, and that though countless rubbishy books
have been written on hunting, as on every other mortal sub-
jects, yet the books that live and delight their readers are the
good books. Think of our own, our unapproachable, WHYTE
MELVILLE, a scholar, a novelist, a poet and one of the gallantcst
gentlemen that ever crossed a saddle. He has the grand style
in literary sportsmanship; his is the brave and breezy nature
appreciative of all noble, generous deeds, his the sense of tears
in mortal things and the deep love for the brave dumb creatures
who lay at our feet their priceless gifts of strength, courage,
affection and devotion. WHYTE MELVILLE is the man: he lives
while Thormanby and his like are already, to all intents and
purposes, dead and forgotten. Hear our Edinburgh Reviewer:

book without being (as LOCKHART said to

the readers of sporting literature are less

going to be a counter-jumper; reassure
her that " bracket turns " have nothing
to do with the damage of wall-decorations.

severely. Ice almost bears in suburbs.

SKVFTXTH is not an ordinary Peer of Parlia-
ment. To-day disclosed possession of rare
gift of in.ikinu' liimself heard throughout
full length of House of Lords. For most
Peers the gorgeous Chamber is the
sepulchre of spceeh. Of COO Peers there are
not more than a score who are able, suc-
cessfully, to fight against the triumphant
faultiness of acoustical properties of the
Chamber. To-day LORD CH VNCKLI/IIC had
occasion to read a form of oath for the
KINO'S (subscription. Over the strained
ears of brilliant assi-mbly there flouted
stray words of mysterious import.
Understood to be some antiquated decla-
ration administered as a dose of sour

mounted British monarchs since times of

When, some minutes later, Loitn CUAX-

his SOVEREIGN a document with broad
black edge, and His MAJESTV began to
read the lengthy speech prepared for him
by his faithful Ministers, his voice, dis-
tinct, sonorous, filled the. Chamber
apparently without effort.
A strange unwonted scene MUK8TY
looked upon seated side by side under
the canopy of the Throne. Every bench on
floor was filled. Masses of black where
th.i Peeresses sat, lightened by the glow
of fair countenances and the flash of
peerless diamonds, contrasted with the
wedges of red driven into the parterre by
closely packed Peers in scarlet robo.5.
[ Long lines of ladies in deepest mourning
tilled the side galleries; they crowded
the gallery where, in ordinary times,
humbler strangers sit. Judges in their
robes and full-bottomed wigs; Bishops in
spotless surplices; Foreign Ministers in
uniform, displaying on their breasts many
j strange orders. At the Bar stood the

stretchers, bath chairs and other Con-
venient locomotive contrivances for tho*
•wounded. BcitnETTCorrrs, biistlinground
on tour of inspection, felt quite at home.
It was not the after-math of a fresh en-
gagement in the not yet ended war. It
was merely borough and county Members
who lind taken part in tho dash on House
of Lords coining back to hear Debate on
Address in Commons.
Six o'clock before actual business com-
menced. SPEAKER took chair at 3.30:
but on these occasions House likes to
waste its freshest hours, rushing into
dinner hour the Leader of House with
speech everyone is waiting for. First
there was swearing in of new Members, a
performance which, if necessity bo in-
sisted upon, might equally effectually, far
more conveniently, be accomplished be-
tween breakfast and luncheon in one of
the Committee Rooms. Then SPEAKER
read collection of musty .Standing Orders
which nobody but JEMMY LOWTHKR minds.
One supplies him with opportunity of
dragging out what is now mere mummy
of » joke. It prohibits, under fearsome
penalties, Peers taking part in Parlia-
mentary elections.
"All my eye," says JKMMY, readily
dropping into the vernacular. "At be-
ginning of every Session we solemnly
affirm this Constitutional principle, and
noble Lords, when it pleases them, ab-
solutely ignore it and us. What does Dr.
WATTS remark?
'Tis not enough to say
You *rc sorry :iml repent,
If you f,'u on in the same way
As you did always went.
In this case, Peers don't even plead sorrow
or affect repentance. They just go on in
the old way: so do we. No use barking
if you can't bite. Let us abolish this
futile injunction."
Much common-sense in this; ad .nimbly
put in a speech once or twice heard. But
JKM.MY has l>con at it now for years, and
repetition, even of n joke, palls upon frail
humanity. Tho Member for Sark knows
an old Seigneur in the adjacent island of
Alderney, who has a story which turns
upon the firing of a gun. On his own
estate the thing works well enough. A
well trained retainer, at a certain stage of
dinner, tiros a gun on the lawn.
"Hallo!" cries the genial host, "there's
a gunshot. That reminds me."
Then comes tho story. When the old
gentleman is visiting at other houses the
wine is more difficult. But he is equal
to it. In a pause in conversation he
kicks the table underneath. "Hallo!"
he says, "was that a gun? Now that
reminds me." Then the story.
Thus our dear JE.MMY. Whenever the
SPEAKER, at the opening of a Session,
submits Standing Order affecting Peers
and Parliamentary elections, JKMMY
pricks up his ears. "Hallo!" he says,
"Peers in Parliament? That reminds
me," and straightway he moves to amend
Standing Order.
To-night he considerately spared speech
but insisted on a division, the whole
performance filching more than a quarter
of an hour. Then came those armed men,
the Mover and Seconder of the Address,
taking precedence of Leaders on both
sides with prolonged utterance of pretty
platitudes.
CAWMKM. - BAXXERMAX, at last finding
his opportunity, was so demoralised that
he displayed the (for him) rare weakness
of taking an hour and a quarter wherein
to say nothing particular. Thus it came
to pass that PRIXCE ARTHI'R, on whose
utterance the crowded House waited, had
only half an hour in which to expound
Ministerial policy and then was driven
perilously close into the dinner hour.
Suppose at opening of next Session, as
soon as the SPEAKER takes the Chair, we
have the Leader of the Opposition deliver-
ing himself of his views of Government
polity past, present, and future; the
Leader of the House replying. Thereafter,
business thus accomplished, play might
commence, including JEMMY LOWTHKR'S
tilt against the Peers, and the pained
orations of the Mover and the Seconder of
the Address.
JJiisiiic.sx done.—Kixo and QCEFX open
Parliament. Address in reply to Speech
moved in both Houses.
Vridnij yifiht.—Sort of haggis of debate.
Remember what the appreciative Scot
said about the national dish? "Some
fine confused feeding in a haggis," he
remarked, smacking his lips.
Talk to-night, rather confused than fine,
began around pure beer; ran into the
War; got back to beer; led to Army
Hospitals; diverted by one Irish Member
to murderous accusations against Generals,
the pick of whom, the pride of all, are
bom Irishmen; trended by another Irish
Member to scholastic mediaeval defini-
tions; finally brought back by Burdett
Coutts to remarks about himself with
references to War Hospital adminis-
tration.
Drear level varied by brief flash of
speech from Lord STAXI.KY. Extending
experience as Chairman of Kitchen Com-
mittee; been out to tho war. Applied
energy ill cutting down kitchen expenses
by truncating war correspondents des-
patches. Thing struck him most in cam-

A thing of nature lost for ever
In that it never did beguile

To coax from man a word of praise
On your profound attainments mental,
Or grieve that false he thought your ways,
As also your arrangements dental.
Perish all your maidhood's deep fears

As yearjon year rolled o'er your head
And took from youth some winning grace,
You quite despaired of being we.I,

When silver hairs you first did spy
When man came not—but only years,
You positively thought you 'd dye.

Too hallow for a human breast.

A TIP FOR LOVERS.
DKAR MR. Prxt'H,—I read in the papers
(how do these things get there ?) that the
Hottentot widow who re-marries has to
cut off the top-joint of a finger, and present
it to her new husband. People of different
colour understand one another's ways
with difficulty, and this account of a
primitive jointure is—in the absence of
African legal commentaries—valuable as
an index to the Black's tone of matrimonial
ethics. No jointure, no marriage. If this
custom prevailed in Europe, a doubting
swain would bo provided with a handy
test. " M'tiimes tui " he would murmur in
the language of passion. "Jf inmm," would
reply the widow, humorously but inaccu-
rately, and she would proceed to suit the
action to the word by at once nailing her
man with the necessary handsel. What
husband would not bo happy thus mon-
strarl tUfjitof Yours, Au UxulK.M.

FEBKVAK Y 1 STH.—Out of a gondola '' I send my heart up to thee.
all my heart." I want you here in Venice, to hold you by the
hand and teach yon tilings about Art not to bo found even in
Baedeker. I should be (ho man, and you would be the woman—
in this Kingdom by the Sea, as Mr. Swixni'RXK said of GF.OROK
SAND and Dn MrssET. You have heard of these people, beloved?
My Italian betters itself. I had a fancy, when I saw Uoyttiia
written up in the railway station on my arrival here, that it
was (he feminine of DIXJC and so should mean the Sea, beeause
the Doges used to wed it with a ring. Of course, it was really
the Custom House (Doiiane). We call our pet gondolier
IPPOPOTAMO, because, for lack of cabs, he is our river-horse.
Who was the old lady who complained that she did not see
Venice under favourable conditions, «s tt WON flooded? No
thought but of you.
19'ni.—By all means, dearest, make an armistice with your
mother, and let us all go into winter-quarters. 1 remember,
the first (and only) time I saw her, she had such an air of
prophylactic maternity that. 1 almost asked her if she knew you
were out. Frankly, beloved, she is really rather an old hen;
or shall we say she is most (or should it be more) like CAIAER-
I.EY's parroquet that declined to die. It was imbecile, too,
you know; the very epithet your mother applied, by implication,
to my mother. Still, 1 must love her a little, since, but for her,
how could 1 have known you? In any case, my whole love to
her son.
20TH.—MOST NEAR,—This must be a, very, very short letter,
as I can hear your horse's gallop in the lane. You are coming,
beloved, you arc coming!
I am just returned from the gate. It was the butcher's boy.
1 kissed his feet from mere association of ideas. You are not
jealous? He is nothing, nothing to me, except that just now
he seemed to take your rightful place. See, 1 lay my cheek on
the words that will soon glow under your eyes. There, 1 have
a black smudge on my nose, and um in mourning for myself.
Lay your nose, dearest, where mine has left the paper still
warm. Your impressionable.
21sT.—(jRACiors,—This is very sudden. Ycjnr dear letter
says that I must understand we parted for ever last Tuesday at
3.30 P.M. Ah ! these things should not be written. Come to
me, come, and with your own lips repeat this remark; and
then by that very act you will belie yourself with lovely
perjury. 1 would say much more, but my pen, for the first
time within my knowledge, refuses. This must show you how
strangely I am your distraught.
22ND.—Of course, my Prince, if you mean it, I must release
you. But nothing shall ever make me stop writing. Do not
imagine me capable of such self-effacement. There is a big
empty play-box upstairs, which 1 am having made into a dead-
letter office- There will be pigeon-holes to take the little
essays which, out of my great love for you, t promise not to
post. You are right in saying (hat I am the most generous
woman you have ever met.
23KD.—UREAT HEART,—I would have you know that there are
consolations. If you had lot me marry you, as I have so con-
sistently urged, that might have been the end of my love-
letters. A'oiu there is no limit set them but the grave. My
pen was always jealous of your presence. A'oit' it knows it is
the dearest thing I ever grasp.
24TH.—I do not propose to outlive my happiness very long.
And, indeed, my own mother died when I was seven. In one of
my letters I told you my family was long-Lived on bath sides.
This, of course, was not true; but 1 wrote it just after your
mother had hinted thut my "stock" was not very good stulT.
Your sorry.
I seek in vain for help from the grief of poets. Words'.
words! a tagging of epitaphs that makes mo sick. "C'eat
aimer pen que de poiivoir dire combien I'on aime." And tho
same with sorrow, only more .so. If I thought that any eye.
but yours would penetrate the secret of my woe, I would
destroy these letters utiwritt^n ; or else be more careful about
the spelling of my Italian.
I cannot stain this paper with tears as I could have wished.
Why will they not come at call, like ink? At each eyelid hangs
one, but only semi-detached, like a Brixton villa. You see, I
am not so sad but I can still compass some happy turn of
thought like this. Your ever ingenious.
25TH.—BELOVED ORPHAN,—Light lie the earth on your mother's
head. Ho short a while ago, and 1 would not have believed that
1 could one day hear of her death unmoved. Yet this morning,
when the news came, 1 could not raise so much as a feeble
smile. Well, she has had her will; and now she has "gone to
her place"—not mine, lot me trust. Dearest, you will never
have another mother like her; nor 1, it seems, a mother-in-law
of any sort.
2BTH.— DKAK ONLY READER (if any),—I was born with a
priic/iaiit for descriptive letters, and had I meant these for
the public eye I should have made your personality shine
more speakingly through them. How should the world know
just what you are to me from a passing reference to your check
riding-breeches and side-whiskers? And that is so long past.
By now you must have replaced the one; and the other you
may have shaved away in a paroxysm of regret.
1 think I could have lost you almost cheerfully if I had
only been told why. One of the saddest memories of my
childhood (I was two at the time) is concerned with a tale rny
NAXA told me, of a poor wronged woman—was she a Queen of
SPAIN, or somebody in TOJI HOOD?—whose true love left her
on a rumour that she had a wooden leg. She was condemned
unheard, and the sentence was practically capital. Like me,
she never ercn knew the charge against her; partly for the
stringency of etiquette, and in part through the proper sensi-
tiveness of her lover, who must, 1 think, a little have resembled
you, beloved.
As a child—perhaps already nursing my woman's seed of
uncomplaining sorrow — the story touched me poignantly.
AKTHUK, on the other hand, who also was present at its
telling, has no memory of it. But then he was my junior,
being barely out of long-clothes.
28™.—MOST STOLID, — This is my last letter, positively.
Tho doctors give me till to-morrow to break up. Ale you
interested to learn tho cause? No? Then 1 must still tell you.
I <iii! dyinti of Curiosity. It is the woman's ruling passion—that,
and love-letter-writing in my case—strong even to the death.
Many unsolicited answers to our conundrum—yours and mine,
beloved, for all that is yours is mine—have been sent in to inc
by good-natured people, perfect strangers to me, most of them.
One writes, quite gently, hazarding the theory that you wero
bored by me. Well meant, but manifestly absurd. Another
guesses that, suddenly, you had recognised your own mother's
madness, and shrank from reproducing it. Some of these
solutions are too paltry to repeat; and one of them unmention-
able on other grounds.
In my secret heart—it may have been through unconscious
association with the story of the wooden leg—1 half believe
that when I called your attention, perhaps with too careless a
pride, to the Norman tint in.my veins, you gathered, from the
eloquence of my love, that their blueness was really due to the
presence of ink in my blood. Well, whatever—I would shed its
last drop for you. Your always most effusive. O. S.

IT is with amazement that I have read
in one or two esteemed contemporaries
the remark that pied cats have been un-
usually scarce this season. To me, as an
ardent devotee of the ait-gun (the catapult
is now held in the supremest contempt
by all Primrose Hill sportsmen), this in-
formation comes as a keen disappointment.
A friend of mine writing from tlie wilds of
North liayswnter assures me that no less
than two of these sprightly little animals
have fallen to his gun during the present
century; which is an uncommonly good
bag, 1 should imagine, considering the

had but one decent shot at a pied cat, and
then 1 fortunately missed her. It was my
dear and very wealthy old aunt's, and she
would never have forgotten or forgiven.
Disciples of the bent-pin have had some
disappointing sport in the round pond on
Ilumpstead. Evidently, the minnow is
partaking of the wide - spreading in-
fluences of popular education, and is not
so open to the crooked argument seduc-
tively dangled before its eyes as is
popularly supposed. A friend of mine,
who persists in advocating the pleasures
of deep-sea fishing over freshwater—or as
fresh as can bo got—sends me a long
letter from Margate, where he says quite
a host of well-known piscatorial per-
sonalities are to be seen daily thronging
the jetty. Catches of crab and harbour
eels, he writes, average one in every two
minutes. One of the advantages of deep-
sea fishing, says my friend in parenthesis,
is the pleasurable, absence of sardine tins
and old shoes. To the most philosophic
line-dangler, the sight of such aquatic
tli'brix on the end of his slender string
brings a distrustful doubt as to whether
some forms of Hritish sport and recreation
are not over-estimated.
For me, exciting as salt-water fishing
is held to be, I think nothing beats
the exhilarating, thrilling, and slightly
perilous sport of " tiddler fishing," as it
is so pleasantly and familiarly called. 1
spent all last Sunday morning casting
over our pond, after having with great
difficulty penned all the ducks. 1 did not
actually catch anything, although 1 noticed
with my pocket-telescope that several
tiddlers nibbled the bread and swam off.
Next Sunday I am going to bait with
brown bread, which is considered very
digestible; and, after all, why not make
your sports as humane as possible?

DRAMATIC SEQUELS.
VII.--IN THE LYoxs DEN.
Whex Lord Lyttox provided the con-
ventional “happy ending '' for The Lady
of Lyons by reuniting Pauline, née Des-
chappelles, to the devoted Claude Melnotte,
promoting the latter to the rank of Colonel
in the French army, he seems not to have
troubled his head as to the divergent
social ideas of the happy pair, nor as to
how the vulgar and purse-proud family of
Deschappelles and the humbler Melnottes
would get on together. The sequel throws
a lurid light on these points. In writing
it, great pains have been taken to make
the blank verse, wherever possible, as
bad as Lord LYTTON'S.
SCENE. — The drawing-room of CLAUDE
MELNoTTE's house. PAULINE is sitting
by the fire, CLAUDE leaning with his
back against the mantel piece. JAMES,
a man-servant in livery, enters with a
card on a salver.
Pauline (reading card). Mrs.
Not at home, JAMES.
Claude (who can never quite get out of
his habit of speaking in blank verse).
Why are you not at home to Mrs.
SMITH 2.
Pauline. My dear CLAUDE, that woman :
Mr. SMITH kept a greengrocer's shop.
'Tis true he made a great deal of money
by his contracts to supply the armies of
the Republic with vegetables, but they
are not gentlepeople !
Claude (in his most Byronic manner).
What is it makes a gentleman, PAULINE 2
Is it to have a cousin in the Peerage 2
Pauline. Partly that, dear.
Claude (refusing to be interrupted). Or
is it to be honest, simple, kind—
Pauline. But I have no reason for
believing Mr. SMITH to have been more
honest than the general run of army
contractors.
Claude (continuing). Gentle in speech
and action as in name?
Oh, it is this that makes a gentleman :
And Mr. SMITH, although he kept a shop,
May very properly be so described.
Pauline. Yes, I know, dear. Everybody
calls himself a gentleman nowadays, even
the boy who cleans the boots. But I am
not going to give in to these unhealthy
modern ideas, and I am not going to visit
Mrs. SMIth. She is not in Society.
Claude (off again on his high horse). What
is Society 2 All noble men
Pauline (objecting). But Mr.
isn't a nobleman, CLAUDE.
Claude. . . . . And women, in whatever
station born.
These, only these, make up “Society.”
Pauline (patiently). But that 's such a
dreadful misuse of words, dear. When one
talks of “Society,” one does not mean good
people, or unselfish people, or high-minded
people, but people who keep a carriage
SMITH !
SMiith
and give dinner parties. Those are the
only things which really matter socially.
Claude. PAULINE, PAULINE, what dread-
ful sentiments'
They show a wordly and perverted mind.
I grieve to think my wife should utter
them "
Pauline (very sweetliſ). I wish, CLAUDE,
you 'd try and give up talking in
blank verse. It's very bad form. And
it 's very bad verse, too. Try and break
yourself of it.
Claude (off again). All noble thoughts,
PAL LINE
Pauline. No, no, no, CLAUDE. I really
can't have this ranting. Byronics are
quite out of fashion.
Claude (relapsing gloomily into prose).
You may laugh at me, PAULINE, but you
know I'm right.
Pauline. Of course you're right, dear.
Much too right for this wicked world.
That's why I never can take your advice
on any subject. You're so unpractical.
("laude (breaking out again). The world,
the world, oh, how I hate this world !
Pauline. Now that's silly of you, dear.
There's nothing like making the best of a
bad thing. By the way, CLAUDE, didn't
you say Mrs. MELNoTTE was coming to
call this afternoon 2
Claude. Yes. Dear mother, how nice it
will be to see her again -
Pauline. It will be charming, of course.
. . . I do hope no one else will call at the
same time. Perhaps I'd better tell JAMES
we are not at home to anyone except Mrs.
MELNOTTE.
Claude. Oh, no, don't do that.
mother will enjoy meeting our friends.
Pauline. No doubt, dear. But will our
friends enjoy meeting your mother ?
(Seeing him about to burst forth again) Oh,
yes, CLAUDE, I know what you are going
to say. But, after all, Lyons is a very
purse-proud, vulgar place. You know,
how my mother can behave on occasions !
And if Mrs. MELNoTTE happens to be here
when any other people call it may be very
unpleasant. I really think I had better
say we are not at home to anyone else.
[Rises to ring the bell.
Claude. PAULINE, I forbid you ! Sit
down at once. If my family are not good
enough for your friends, let them drop us
and be hanged to them.
Pauline. CLAUDE, don't storm. It 's so
vulgar. And there's not the least occa-
sion for it either. I only thought it would
be pleasanter for all our visitors—your
dear mother among the number—if we
avoided all chance of disagreeable scenes.
But there, dear, you've no savoir faire,
and I'm afraid we shall never get into
Society. It's very sad.
Claude (touched by her patience). I am
sorry, my dear. I ought to have kept my
temper. But I wish you weren't so set
upon getting into Society. Isn't it a little
snobbish?
My
Pauline (wilfully misunderstanding him).
It's dreadfully snobbish, dear; the most
snobbish sort of Society I know. All
provincial towns are like that. But it's
the only Society there is here, you know,
and we must make the best of it.
Claude. My poor PAULINE. [Kissing her.
Pauline (gently). But you know, CLAUDE,
social distinctions do exist. Why not re-
cognize them 2 And the late Mr. MEL-
NoTTE was a gardener
Claude. He was—an excellent gardener.
Pauline. One of the Lower Classes.
Claude. In a Republic there are no
Lower Classes.
Pauline (correcting him). In a Republic
there are no Higher Classes. And class
distinctions are more sharply drawn than
ever in consequence.
Claude. So much the worse for the Re-
public.
Pauline (shocked). CLAUDE, I begin to
think you are an anarchist.
Claude. I? (Proudly) I am a colonel in
the French army.
Pauline. But not a real colonel, CLAUDE.
Only a Republican colonel.
Claude (sternly). I rose from the ranks
in two years by merit.
Pauline. I know, dear. Real colonels
only rise by interest. [CLAUDE gasps.
James (opening the door and sluowing in
a wizened old lady in rusty black garments
and a bonnet slightly awry). Mrs. MEL-
Norre. [PAULINE goes forward to greet her.
Mrs. M. (not seeing her). Ah, my dear
son (runs across the room to CLAUDE before
the eyes of the deeply scandalised JAMES,
and kisses him repeatedly), how glad I am
to see you again! And your grand house !
And your fine servants In livery, too !
[PAULINE shudders, and so does JAMEs.
The latter goes out.
Claude. My dearest mother! [Kisses her.
Mrs. M. (beaming on PAULINE). How do
you do, my dear? Let me give my CLAUDE's
wife a kiss. [Does so in resounding fashion.
Pauline (as soon as she has recovered
from the warmth of this embrace). How do
you do, Mrs. MELNottrº Won't you sit
down 2
Mrs. M. Thank you kindly, my dear. I
don't mind if I do.
[A ring is heard outside, followed by
the sound of someone being ad-
mitted. PAULINE looks anxiously
towards the door.
Pauline (to herselſ). A visitor :
unlucky : I wonder who it is.
James (throwing open the door). Mrs.
DESCHAPPELLES.
Pauline. Great Heavens, my mother:
How
[Falls back, overwhelmed, into her chair.
Mrs. D. (in her most elaborate manner).
My dear child, you are unwell. My
coming has been a shock to you. But
there, a daughter's affection, CLAUDE—
(shaking hands with him)—how wonderful
it is .

Pauline. Dear mother, we are delighted
:o see you.
Mrs. D. Of course. I ought to have
called before. I have been meaning to
omo ever since you returned from your
loneyinoou. But I have so many visits
0 pay; and you have only been back
;en weeks!
Pauline. I quite understand, nutlicr
lear.
Mrs. D. And. as I always say to your
poor father, "When one is a leader of
Society, one has so many engagements."
[ am sure yon find that.
Pauline. I have hardly begun to receive
visits yet.
Mrs. D. No, dear? But then it's
different with you. When you married
.'olonel MELXOTTE, of course you gave up
all .social ambitions.
Mrs. M. I am sure no one could wish
tor a better, braver husband than my
ClAUDB.
Mrs. D. (turning sharply round and
>bserving Mrs. MELXOTTE for the first time

Mrs. M. (bravely). I said no one could
have a better husband than CLAUDE.
Mrs. D. (dumbfounded, appalling to
Pauline). Who—who is this person?
Pauline (nervously). 1 think you have met
before, mother. This is Mrs. MELXOTTE.
Mr».I>.(Insolently). Oh! the gardener's
wife?
Claude (melodramatic at onre). Yes.
The gardener's wife and my mother!
Mrs. D. (impatiently). Of course,! knou
the unfortunate relationship between you,
CLAUDE. You need not thrust it down mj
throat. You know how unpleasant it is
to me.
Pauline (shocked at this bad taste)
Mother!
Mrs. D. Oh, yes, it is. As I was saying
to your poor father only yesterday. "O:
course, CLAUDE is all right. He is ai
officer now, and all officers are suppose!
to be gentlemen. Hut his relatives arc
impossible, quite impossible!"
Claude (furiously). This insolence is
intolerable. Madame DESCHAPPELLEN .
Mrs. M. (intervening). CLAUDE, CLAUDE
don't be angry! Remember who she is.
Claude (savagely). 1 remember wel
enough. She is Madame DESCHAPPELI.ES
and her husband is a successful tradesman
lie was an English shop-boy, and his prope
name was CHAPEL. He came over t>
France, grew rich, put a "de" before hi
name, and now gives himself airs like the
other pnrrcniig.
Mrs. D. Monster!
Pauline. My dear CLAI'DE, how \vondci
fully interesting 1
Mrs. M. (rising). My son, you must no
forget your manners. M rs. Db'sCHAlM'KI.LK
is PA I LINK'S mother. 1 will go away now
and leave you to make your apologies t
her. (CLAi'DK tries to prevent her going.
STO, no, I will go, really, flood-bye, my
on; good-bye, dear PAULINE.
[Kisses her and goes out.
Mrs. D. If that woman imagines that I
in going stay here after being insulted
iy you as I have been, she is much mis-
aken. Please, ring for my carriage.
Claude rings.) As for you, PAULINE, I
Iways told you what would happen if
•on insisted on marrying beneath you,
nd now you sec I 'm right.
Pi/ii/ine (quietly). You seem to forget,
namma, that papa was practically a bank-
upt when I married, and that CLAUDE
>aid his debts.
Mrs. /). I forget nothing. And I do
lot see that it makes the smallest differ-
nce. I am not blaming your poor father
or having his debts paid by Colonel
MELXOTTE; I am blaming you for marry-
iig him. Good-bye.
[.She sweeps out ill a towering passion.
Pauline. Sit down, CLAUDE, and don't
glower at me like that. It 's not my fault
f mamma does not know how to behave.
Claude, (struggling with his r:ige). That's
:rue, that 's true. •
Pauline. Poor mamma, her want of
3reeding is terrible! , 1 have always
lot iced it. But that story alwut Mr.
UIIAPEL explains it all. Why didn't you
X3ll it to me before?
Claude. I thought it would pain you.
Pauline. Pain me? I am delighted with
t! Why, it explains everything. It ex-
plains HIP. It explains you, even. A Miss
CHAPEL might marry anyone. Don't frown
CLAUDE; laugh. We shall never get into
Society in Lyons, but, at least, we shall
never have another visit from mamma.
The worst has happened. We can now
live happily ever afterwards. ST. J. H.

With merely a difference, wear my rue;
For my years were few,
And her eyes were blue.
And they pierced my soft heart through

And behold I was wedded or ever I knew

The General's office at the headquarters
of a tlisti ict. Jii the room tiro tables
covered with green baize, a row of red-
covered books on each; an almanack,
list of returns, etc., are on the green-
jsapered trails, strips of carpet are on
the boarded floor. A fine view of -parade
ground and bin-racks i.» obtained through
two windows. A smart young Gene nil,
ii'/io h«s just taken over command, in
undress uniform, a row of medal rib-
bons on his coat, a "swagger stick"
under his arm, is standing before the
fire-place, an elderly Stuff Officer is
sitting at the smaller of tlie two tables.
The General. We '11 make our garrison
ield - day on Thursday the real thing,
'HAPMAN. eh? We'll have a fight under
he absolute conditions of warfare and no
nake-believe, except that the cartridges
shall be blank instead of loaded ones.
The Staff Officer (who has been through
t all before). Yes, Sir.
The General. Have out the whole bri-
gade. How many can we muster?
The Staff Officer. Well, Sir, the big draft
'or India, volunteers for Africa, and the
200 horses they 've been called upon to
irovide, allowed for, the Dragoons won't
stand more than a hundred strong on
>arade. The battery will send out four
guns. The Rutlands, if we suspend mus-
tetry and military training, and put all
he recruits in the ranks, may stand 300.
The Southern Fusiliers, who nnd the guards
that day, about 200, and the Ballinasloe
Rifles, 230.
The. General. But, good gracious me,
what becomes of the men?
The. Staff Officer. Orderly men. Sir,
garrison employ, fatigue duties, men in
hospital, men on light duty, men on guard,
men coming oft guard, men on picquet and
police duties, orderlies, men struck off all
work by special order, men at Aldershot,
cooking, gymnasium classes, men away for
mounted infantry, submarine-mining, gun-
nery, and surveying training.
The General. Stop, stop; that's enough.
My brigade shrinks to a regiment.
The Staff Officer. The parade will bt-
"as strong as possible," Sir.
The General. Well, now, as to place
(ftpreudiug on the. bigger table an ordnanc,-
map.) 1 see there 's a line stretch of down
and common land here, twenty miles t.i
the north. We'll scud our red force out
there on Wednesday to camp, with all
military precautions, and
The Staff Officer. How about transport,
Sir? We sent the draft horses of tho
regimental transport to Plymouth, on an
urgent order last week, and the waggon-*
have been returned to the carriage factory

The General. Hire. •

Besides, Sir, the last time there were
manoeuvres on those downs, the com-
moners put in a claim for destruction of
turf and gorsc, and got it, and no
manoeuvres may now take place there
without special orders and a special
grant.
The General (running his finger over a
tract of enclosed country). What about
this bit of land round Straw-field?
The Stuff Officer. Compensation for
crops, compensation for hedgerows, com-
pensation for trees, compensation for
ground game—quite impossible, Sir.
Tlie General. Then where on earth are
we to fight'!
The Stuff Officer. Them is the big drill-
field just outside the town, Sir, that has
always been used for the purpose.
The General. And every officer and every
man knows every inch of it.
The Staff Officer. We try to give a
variety to the, "general idea,'' Sir. On
the last field-day the garrison bakery was
supposed to be an inaccessible hill, the
garrison chaplain's garden, which juts
into the field, was an inundation, and the
railway, which cuts across the end of the
Uelcl, was supposed to be an nnfordabU
river. The time before we practised
desert warfare, and the bakery was con-
sidered a mosque, not to be occupied hj
either force, the chaplain's lawn tennis
ground was an oasis, and the railway
precipitous gorge.
Tlie General. And what do you suggesl
this time?
The Staff Officer. To make the, fleld-da>
thoroughly useful, 1 would suggest South
Africa, the railway a donga, the bakery;
krantz, the tennis ground a vlei.
The General. Yes, yes.
The Stuff Officer. Will it be necessarj
under the circumstances to close the re-
gimental shops, put the officers servant
in the ranks, and suspend musketry?
The General. Do what you like. 1 sha'n'l
stay here to see such tomfoolery. Lei
the senior colone^l take command. 1 'II gc
up to town that day.

QUESTIONS OF THE HOUR.
MrcH diligence having boon evincec
by the Daily Press in hunting up prece-
dents for the pageant of last Thursday
Afr. Punch's own Constitutional Quidnuju
has selected a few of the more vita
points in which the present resembles
or differs from, earlier ceremonies :—
Famuli* Creams.—The horses which took
part in Thursday's procession are not th<
some as those which drew Queen VICTORIA
to IKM" coronation.
Gun Salute.—We have searched HOI.IX-
MiiKD in vain for any mention of a similar
ceremonial on the accession of King
ALFKKD.

FORETHOUGHT.
Wife, (to absent-minded husband, tcfti has just, directed the Cabman to drive to
Scotland Yard). ''CHARHB! WHY ox EARTH BO you WANT TO oo TO SCOTLAND YAKD!"
Absent-minded Husband. "Wav, YOU KNOW, DEAR. I AH CONSTANTLY LEAVING MY
UMBRELLA IN A CAB, AND THEN NEXT DAY GOING TO SCOTLAND YARD TO GET IF BACK,
SO THIS TJME I'M OOfNG TO TAKK IT 8TRATOHT THERE UYSSLF, AND THEN THERB CANNOT
US ANY MISTAKE."
Hiii/iil Ilube.—The number of tail-tips
in King EjiWAltn's ermine lining, which
is computed at upwards of 10,000, is
quite the largest on record.
House of Commons.—\Vo are assured,
by an eye-witness of last week's cere-
mony, that in the rush after the Sl'EAKKIl
to the House of Lords several members
sustained severe injuries. This is strictly
in accordance with precedent.
Roijtil Ad(/ir*8.—The Kixo did not follow
the example of his illustrious great-grand-
father in addressing the august assembly
as " My Lords and Turkey-Cocks."
State OriKiment*.—It is understood that
the buckle on the left shoe of the Lord
bearing the Cap of Maintenance pre-
sented striking dissimilarities to that
worn by any of his predecessors on for-
me:- occasions.

"Yes. Am I to
take what remains of the Nelson Relics?
"No, but you are to look at the picture
gallery."
"But I cannot find the picture gallery,
for it has disappeared. The hospital has
disappeared!" .
"Has it also been shaken down by the
trembling of the earth?"
"Yes. It has shared the fate of the

tracted so much

dowed. I have been
everywhere after
him, but always
five minutes too

to Keusal Green,
to Smithtleld, to
Covent Garden and
then to Richmond
and Kew. But never
quite in time; but

PUNCH, OH THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Invoca-
tion.

THE EVOLUTION OF A MUSICAL COMEDY.
[It if pre<=um?d, ffentle reader, that you have., at some time or oth?r, been
present at one of those feasts of mirth and melody which are so popular in th?
Metropolis nowadays. Unless you happen Jo be " in the kno-.v," the following
account of ho-,v such a feast is concocted may be of interest.]
PROEM.
SPIRIT of Entertainment, fickle fay!
Where, in the theatre-going world to-day,
Dost thou hold firm and undisputed sway
Second to none 1
Is it in melodrama fierce and hot?
Is it in problem plays with little plot?
Here thou may'st rest awhile, but they do not
Long enough run.
The Poet's Boisterous farce will sometimes make a hit,
Fancy. Drawing forth laughter till our sides should split;
Comedy, crusted o'or with verbal wit,
All have their day.
But, for a venture like to draw the town,
Even though morbid pessimists may frown,
Give me the much extolled and much run
down
Musical play.
Type of an age that's frivolous, may be,
Owing a lot to Fashion's stern decree;
Many an hour of harmless pleasantry
Still it affords.
Sparkling with melody that comes and goes,
Mirth that delights and mlse-en-scene that
glows,
Who is to wonder at such tempting shows
Holding tho boards?
The Reader to Some, through these pages, may be glad, perchance,
follow his jnto tho hidden works to take a glance ,
Leader, Noticing how such blends of song and dance
Reach their success.
No carping curiosity we mean,
But, from a passing glance behind tho scene,
Probably more instruction we may glean
Thau one might guess.
CANTO THE FIRST.
The Manager. Come, let us trace tho fountain to its source;
Follow with me, with deferential tread,
Unto the Manager, for he, of course,
Is the presiding spirit and the head
Of all those schemes which, emanating hence,
Startle the town with their magnificence.
Into his sanctum pass through outer doors
Thronged all about, from morning until night,
With histrionic applicants in scores,
Seeking employment, howsoever light.
This is but one small trial, you must know,
Of the successful impresario.
Commander of a mighty host indeed,
In town and in the provinces as well,
Many a staunch lieutenant does he need
To deal with business more than one can tell;
Yet, when in doubt, on him they have to call,
The Alpha and tho Omega of nil.
And yet, see what a kindly smile is this,
As ev'ry nervous applicant ho greets;
It seoms to say there's nothing much amiss
With all the latest box-office receipts.
Fair the reward of such an one as he,
Who studies carefully the great B. P.
The Malinger
seeth necessity
for a noveltr.
And suni-
moneth his
adherents.

Pegasus
brcaketh into
a canter.
Reaping the harvest of his last sucecsr,
—Though it, no doubt, is not the only one—
His managerial mind is, more or less,
At case throughout the fulness of its run;
Still, for the greatest of dramatic booms,
Far, far away, the mournful last night looms.
While time upon its steadfast course may fly,
His gay productions brave the flight of years;
And hundredth nights are celebrated by
The giving of rcelierehe souvenirs.
But, as I fancy I remarked before,
An end for cv'rything must be in store.
So, when he sees, as some sad day he will,
That the amount of weekly booking falls;
While pit and gallery no longer fill,
And " paper" finds its way into the stalls;
He knows that piece is practically dead,
And he must get another one instead.
Forth goes tho managerial decree,
"A play, a play ; my kingdom for a play;

CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG RIDERS.
CHAP. VIII.
Of the Edinburgh Review—Of Hares and Stags and Foxes—
The, origins of Far-Hunting.
LET us imagine, then, that yon have primed yourself with all
the lore contained in that excellent Edinburgh Review article
lo which 1 referred you last week. You have had a good day's
hunting: the scent has been keen, the hounds have run like
smoke, your ardent but docile bay has carried you to perfection,
the fox has been pulled down in the open, and you have spared
a pitying thought for the fate of this gallant marauder, dying
game to the last in the remorseless scrimmage of his pursuers.
Now, with a glow of healthy fatigue tingling through your
whole body, you are walking or jogging homewards with a few
companions. The incidents of the day have been exhaustively
discussed; you turn to more general matters. One of the
sportsmen may remark that there exist on the face of the
earth races of men so hopelessly abandoned as to shoot or trap
foxes. A groan of horror comes from his companions; their
manly British breasts heave with emotion at the dreadful
thought. This is your opening : —
Young Rider. Well, for the matter of that, we used to
massacre foxes in England.
First Sportsman. Rats!
Young Rider. No, not rate, foxes. Give you my word of
honour we did. (Sensation.)
First Sporlxman. Get out! Do you mean to say we used to
kill 'cm without hunting 'em—eh, what?
Young Rider. Certainly, we did. People began with hare-
hunting. They used to place nets over foxes' earths, smoke
'em out and kill 'em with clubs. There was a Solicitor-General
who said it wasn't foul play to knock foxes and wolves on the
head. \A IKIHKI-. indicating polite incredulity.
.Second Sportsman. Oh, you mean back among the ancient
Britons, or the Druids—Boadicea, and all that?
Y. R. Not a bit of it. Fox-hunting didn't begin properly
till close on the seventeenth century, and even then they
didn't think much of it.
Second Sportsman (putting a poser). What did they think
much of, then?
1". K. Oh, hare-hunting or stag-hunting. But the only
people who hunted stags were the big-wigs, the great nobles
with large estates who could do the thing in style.
First Sportsman (still incredulous). Stag-hunting V
Y. R. Yes, stag-hunting.
.Second Sportsman. But, I say—not carted stags!
Y. R. No, no. Real stag-hunting, not what a fellow in a
review calls "that grotesque, but harmless parody of sport,
the chase of the carted deer."
First Sportsman. Ha, ha! that's good! Grotesque but harmless
thingummy—that's capital! These writing chaps do get hold
of an idea sometimes—eh, what?
With this 1 advise you to pause awhile. At this point you 've
got your company with you. You have filled them with con-
tempt for the past and a hearty satisfaction with the present,
and have left them with the idea that they are far finer and
more knowing fellows than the paltry folk who, in by-gone
centuries, were ignorant of the glories and delights of fox-
hunting. But if you pursue the matter, they '11 begin to think
you know too much, or that they themselves might conceivably
come under the suspicion of knowing too little. So you may
keep for a future occasion such tags of information as that Sir
ROBERT WALPOLE, who opened before all other despatches the
letters from his huntsman, was a hare-hunter; or that the
original Vine Hounds did not give up the hare for the fox
until 1791, or that Lord ARUNDEU, OF WARDOTR is believed, o«
good authority, to have kept the first pack of fox-hounds
between the years 1090 and 1700; or that this same pack
was sold to the "famous Mr. Hcco MKYNEI.L, who was
the real father of modern fox-hunting." All these matters you
will find set out in a very pleasant way in the article 1
have mentioned—these, and many other matters such as,
for instance, the tragic end of "Prince" BOOTHBV, brother-
ill - law to Mr. MEYNKI.L. It is recorded that after a
breakfast of cold tea at his lodging in Clarges Street, and
a ride in Hyde Park, he blew out his brains because he was
"tired of the bore of dressing and undressing." "Man filf,"
HO the father of M. de Connors wrote to his son, "La vie
m'ennuic. Je la quitte," and quit it he did, surely enough,
and possibly, if the truth were known, his weariness of exis-
tence came not from the larger boredoms of life, but from the
interminable tcdioas repetition of unbuttoning and going to
bed and getting out of bed and re-buttoning. And in the days
of the Regency, when "Prince Boom

THE British Government cries "Heads!" but the Chinese

"If you have but one head to wear

SHARSPEARE ON DRINK ADUL-
TERATION.
DEAir MR. PUNCH,-Knowing you to be
an earnest student of the Immortal Bard
and, as your name implies, an authority
on strong drink, I venture to point out to
you that SHAKSPEARE proves that the
adulteration of certain alcoholic bever-
SIR 1 Put HER over THE
ages was as well known in his day as it
is in ours. For instance, Camillo in the
Winter's Tale speaks of a-
“Lingering dram that should notwork maliciously
like poison.”
Again, Falstaff knew as much about
strong drink as any man in his day, and
what does he say?
“Let a cup of sack be my poison!”
Then he denounces the liquor at the
famous Boar's Head Tavern, in East Cheap,
in these unmistakable terms:–
“You rogue, there's lime in this sack too; there
is nothing but roguery to be found in villainous
man, yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack
with lime in it !”
That's pretty straight evidence, Sir,
isn't it 2
But probably more striking than any
other passage in the works of the Divine
WiLLIAM, are the convincing words of the
Queen in the last act of Hamlet:—
“Oh, my dear Hamlet. The drink, the drink!
I am poisoned . "
In these modern days of stage realism I
suppose any one of our up-to-date manager-
actors would make the Queen point to a
handsome tankard, which had been filled
from a silver jug labelled “Beer,” held
by one of the attendants, who, having
taken a sip or two on the sly would now be
seized with qualms, and would join the

other sufferers in the final tableau of
Hamlet.
Pretty conclusive proofs of adulteration
are those given above, are they not Sir?
And you can take it from me, that what
SHAKSPEARE didn't know about the tricks
of the trade in drink in his own time was
not worth knowing. Another quotation
(not included in the foregoing) from the
Anti-Beery Bard may, perhaps, receive ad-
ditional emphasis fromt the point of a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WAKING THEM UP AT THE ST. JAMES'S.
The Awakening, by Mr. HADDON CHAMBERS, is not another
specimen of the modern "Problem Play," nor is it a play of
•which the success is problematic. Its success, we may fairly
take it for granted, is already achieved, and thereupon are to be
complimented Mr. HADDON CHAMBERS, Mr. GEOROE ALEXANDER,
and the excellent company now under his management at the
St. James's Theatre. But if The Atoakening offers no problem,
does it give a probable basis whereon to build up the play?
The basis is, that a young girl, owing all her education in art,
literature, religion and morals, to the loving and tender care of
her widowed father, an artist of some repute, with whom she had
lived in the country till his death, after which she continued to
reside in the same cottage (if that can be called a cottage, of
which in one room alone could be given a dance for some sixty
persons or more; but let this pass—some parties, especially
heroines, arc so uncommonly lucky), attended only by an old
and attached nurse (as Juliet
might have been had she been
left an orphan), and a maid
(mentioned but invisible) em-
ploying her leisure in painting
and perhaps occasionally
making a trifle by it (but this
is not clear), should be, after a
very brief and slight acquaint-
ance, so fascinated by the
charms of a youngish (thirty or
thirty-live ?) gentleman, visit-
ing in the neighbourhood, as
to have taken his invitation to
call upon him in town seri-
ously; and that this young
English Juliet should have
suddenly, proprlo 1110(11, packed
up her portmanteau, bade tin
!'"i'>ir to her nurse, and have
tfiiined to town, put up at an
hotel formerly frequented by
her father (which is a. saving
clause, and accounts for her
being served with a perfect
little dinner), and then, having
secured a first-rate hansom,
with a polite, good - looking
driver and a first-rate horse _
(O exceptionally lucky in-
genue /), should huvo been taken straight away to
fascinating gentleman's abode, whence hearing ho had
"company " she drives away to nowhere in particular, return-
ing, however, at about 10.45 just in time to catch her Homeo,
who happening to be an early bird, is on the point of retiring
for the night. She is admitted, and then, after awhile, he, act-
ing always, as far as the audience can tell, with a certain
amount of proper caution, sees her home. That is the start of
it all. Admit all this as a probable basis, and there 's nothing
to be said except that the author has constructed upon it a
very well-written, very pretty, and highly entertaining play.
Mr. GKOIICB ALKXANDKII, who seems to have made up his mind
never to '' make up" his face in modern comedy, gi vos us a cure-
fully considered study of character in the person of Mr. James
fit. John Trower, a gentleman who, posing as a conventional cynic,
occasionally fatuous, with a dormant sense of honour and a
very slight appreciation of humour, becomes a convertite of a
very high grade when true love, which includes all that sclf-
sacriflce entails, has cast out of him the demon of egoism, by
which he was possessed.
Miss FAY DAVIS, as that most ingenuous of simple-minded
ingenue* 0/ii><; Lawrence, must have been most accurately
measured for the part by Mr. CHAMBERS, so perfectly does it
become her, and so admirably does she suit if.
Mr. H. B. IRVING'S Lord Reginald Dngdale is a delightful
creation of a nondescript sort of person that might find a place
among the eccentric beings in one of Mr. LEAR'S Nonsense
Books. This Lord Reginald (there seldom now-a-days is a
comedy without a "Regi" in it) is.a composite character, made
up apparently out of materials which recall Master Modus in
The Hunchback, linxil Georgione in The Colonel, Lord Veritopht
(in the presence of Kate Nickleby), Master Hlender (sighing and
doting on sweet A line Page), and Lord Dundreary: indeed, had
Mr. IT. B. IRVING met with the exceptional chance that
caused Lord Dundreary to supersede the hero in The American
Cousin, it would be quite on the cards that this part could be
so developed and magnified as to put all the others into the
shade. The audience accepts the character, little as there is
of it, at Mr. iRVINfi's valuation, and delight in whatever Lord
Reginald does or says. He has very little to do and not much
to say, but he and Miss (lliAN-
VILLK, as Miss Prexcott (quite
the most original and, at the
same time, most natural part
among .the principals in the
piece), crown themselves with
such laurels of comedy as are
accorded only to a very first-
rate performance of the anti-
quated love scenes, between
Helen and .Modus, in SHERIDAN
KNOWLKS'S The Hunchback.
Miss GERTRUDE KINGSTON, as
-.'"-•'- I Ludij Margaret fitainea, the
representative of the chief of
"Jim" Truii'er'a many eon-
quests among married ladies of
title, artistically triumphs in
rendering this character so
odious—especially iu her scene
where she plays the ELEANOR
to Olive's KAMI ROSAMUND—as
to banish all sympathy with
her from the hearts of tho
spectators. The author tries to
let her down easily in the last
act, but we only pity him for this
weak concession to common-
place good-nature. It is a really
remarkable impersonation,
this , Mr. A. E. MATTHEWS, as the boyish Cecil Bint, typical of the

latest "form" in fast juvenility, is, as Cecil would express it,
"about as good as they make 'em."
Mr. VINCENT, as Jaruis, the butler, needs no character,
except his own most conscientious reading of this one, for his
next place.
By Miss TALBOT'S artistic rendering of Mrs. Mby, the nurse to
this new Juliet, is to be obtained all the insight into her young
charge's character and history that may make for, or against,
the probabilities of the plot as they have already been herein
stated.
Miss JrLiE Opr, as Mrs. Herbcrtson, one of Jim Trwer's
minor victims in society, docs to perfection all that tho author
requires of her, which is not of nil exhaustive character.
]n brief, the piece is thoroughly well acted all round.. One
word as to the generally woll written and evenly-balanced
dialogue of the piece. Quotations from scripture1, placed in the
mouths of any characters in a comedy for the mere purpose of
raising a laugh by the smartness of their application, can never
be considered as specimens of good taste on the part of tho
author, nor on the part of those responsible for the production
of the piece, from the Licenser of Plays down to the stage-

little known to Europeans (except such as form units in an

keen observation and the power of lively description. His

his arrival at Gildessa is a vivid picture. Although on

The conversation long flagged. When it came to a dead stop,
the morning caller remarked "People in England take an
extreme interest in Ethiopia." Encouraged by the King's
reception of thin pleasing remark, Mr. VlVIAX asked that he
might be graciously favoured by being made transmitter of a
message to the English people. The King consented, and my
Baronito remembers reading the message in the columns of the
Daily Exprenii. It struck him at the time as resembling rather
the literary style of Tudor Street than of Addis Ababa. How-
cver, it was very interesting; and so is the book, its value
largely increased by eighty illustrations from photograph*

to get through for newspaper publication. They are included

House of Commons, Monday, February 18.
—The MARKISS, hampered by insistence
of HARRY CHAPLIN upon resolve to with-
draw upon a position of fuller personal
freedom in politics, paralysed by deter-
mination of GRAND CROSS to rest on his
laurels and his pension, bethought him
how he might strengthen his Ministry,
lu the dilemma, like GOLDSMITH'S Traveller,
"his heart untravelled fondly turned to
home." HATFIELD, the hub of the Universe,

trative diamond digging. As the LORD
CHANCELLOR says, "Worldly advance-
ment, like charity, should begin at home."
Unfortunately for the State, home circle
limited. Successive drafts already nar-
rowed it. There remained the Son and
Heir.
"Come," said the MARKISS, "let us
make him Under-Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs."
Of all subaltern posts in the Administra-
tion, this far away the most difficult and
delicate. With chief in House of Lords,
Under-Secretary is medium of communi-
cation between the Department and the
public. As compared with his position
in Commons, Secretary for State in the
Lords has easy berth. Under-Secretary
always in evidence, assailed night after
night by searching questions.
Difficulty of position illustrated by
PRIN-CE ARTHUR when, ST. JOHN BRODHICK
succeeding GEORGE CuitzoN at the critical
outpost, he wrapped him round with
peremptory injunction not to be inveigled
into attempt to swim without bladders.
To meet Questions appearing on paper,
Under - Secretary was provided with
carefully considered reply written in se-
clusion of Foreign Office. Mustn't, in
any circumstances, be led into supple-
menting its absence of information.
House always resented this innovation;
put up with it perforce; lio use arguing
against majority of six score and ten.
By dint of carefully eschewing reference
to specially obnoxious circumstance
establishing rule, soreness somewhat
healed. Many Members forgotten PHINCE
ARTHUR'S autocratic agency; had come
to regard the matter as arising upon
initiative of Under - Secretary himself,
possibly justified by exigencies known at
the Foreign Office.
To-night, the familiar episode recurred.
Question on paper with relation to Minis-
ters of Allied Powers in Pekin. SON AND
HEIR read off answer from manuscript;
pressed for further information after
manner of twentieth Century, was stricken
with diplomatic dumbness.
"Will not the Noble Lord answer?"
JOHN DILLON insisted.
Up gat the latest tower of strength
to the Ministry, and ingenuously replied,
"The Lender of the House has stated
that it is an understanding the Under-
secretary shall not answer Supplementary
Questions."
Something Bismarckian in the crude
simplicity of this confession, the apparent
gratuitous giving away a position. Only,
when BISMAKCK played the game he
always won. Now House flashed forth in
blaze of righteous wrath. Was its pri-
vilege of full inquiry to be limited at
BANNEIIMAN. Strong suspicion of hypno-
tism at work as, when AsQL'lTH declared
himself a convert to annexation; when he
insisted war must be carried out to the
end; when he agreed forthwith to at-
tempt at planting in conquered States fully
equipped machinery of constitutional
Government, he always turned round to
C.-B.. and waving his hand in peculiar
manner said, "And that's what my right
hou. friend thinks."
C.-B.'s body moved; half opened his

ASQ-TH HYPXOTISK3
caprice of a Minister? For two hours
and a-hnlf debate foamed; on division in
crowded House Ministerial majority re-
duced to 45.
Business done.—Quite a lively night.
The Unexpected happened through its
long length. No opportunity for prepar-
ing long speeches; consequently, House
seen at its best in the give-and-take of
unpremeditated debate.
Tuesday.—Irish Members had little sur-
prise in store to-night. Still harping
on Address. ASQUITH made speech on
position of affairs in South Africa that
might have been delivered from Treasury
Bench. Special charm was it purported
to express views and opinions of CAWMELL-
C.-P,"
mouth us if about to speak. ASQUITH
made another rapid movement with out-
stretched hand; C.-B. fell back in his
seat, what time the Ministerialists cheered,
Bon REID glared, Irish Members howled.
After this surprised at nothing, not
even when, from Irish camp, uprose a
rustic figure remarking:
"A nuchdar.'iu, mar Eiremmach 6 iiit go lab-
hartlmi', gacdilin blath, fc-ar o nasum go bfuil
teanga uiri, agus ati tin ng bruin snofrso d-ffguil

This may have been to the point; ob-
vious difficulty iii assuming certainty.
SPEAKER, stretching hands forth on elbow
of chair, looked aghast; quickly seized

situation; the exile from Erin, forlorn by
the banks of Thames, had dropped into
liis native tongue.
Mr. MURPHY, rising later—" clothed
just as I am," he said, proudly draw-
ing attention to his new knock-me-down
suit of light tweed—explained, that the
gentleman from East Kerry was moved
by conviction that "the Irish tongue is

"Order! order !" the SPEAKER sternly
3ried, fearful of fresh incursion of the Irish.
SPEAKER inexorable, and like the harp
that once through Tara's Halls the soul
af music shed, Mr. O'DONNELL sat as mute
in St. STEPHEN'S Halls as if that soul were
Bed.
Business done. — Debate on Address.
JOHN AIRD, just back from damming the
Nile, took the Oath with a grace and
ease that charmed the onlooker. "It 's
practice, you know," said JOHN, with his
usual modesty.
Thursday. — When PRINCE ARTHUR un-
expectedly rose to follow T. W. RUS-
SELL in his tirade on Irish Land Question
there was general impression that T. W.
was about to catch it. Members recalled
occasion when the PRINCE turned and rent
HENRY HOWORTH, who had not made him-
self anything like so offensive as T. W.,
fresh from Ulster, succeeded in doing.
Last time T. W. spoke it was from
Treasury Bench, where he sat a subaltern
in a Government in which landlords pre-
Jominated. To-night, he rose up from
l>elow gangway and, amid rapturous
?heers from Land Leaguers opposite,
jailed the landlord accursed.
An odd, sharply-contrasted change; but
P. W. had explanation ready. "1 have
.•hanged," he said, "I admit. But Ire-
and also has changed."
Concatenation of circumstance, coin-
cidence of date, happy since they syn-
chronised with the MARKISS'S intimation
that there was no place for T. W. in the
reconstructed Ministry.
PRINCE ARTHUR, tossing about on
Treasury Bench whilst T. W. fulminated
'rom below gangway, was a changed man
.vhen he stood on his feet. Almost dove-like
n his attitude towards "my hon. friend";
.vould not question his motives; would
lot quote old speeches delivered by him;
>nly regretted that he should adopt a
ityle of oratory which, harmless in the
House, might prove disastrous in the in-
lammable fields of Ulster.
Members felt it wasn't for this PRINCK
ARTHUR had at the particular moment
nterposed. Soon the secret was out.
There were threats of revolt in Ulster
-amp; PRINCE ARTHUR'S business was to
lip this in bud by declaring pending vote
>ne of confidence in best of all Govern-
ments. That made clear, Debate might
safely be left to shape itself.
Business done. — REDMOND atne moved
amendment to Address, demanding estab-
lishment of system compulsory land pur-
chase in Ireland. Negatived by 235 votes
against 140.
Friday. — Still talk of WINSTON
CHURCHILL'S speech. Much interest per-
tained to occasion; high expectation;
both justified. Fortunate in circumstances
attending his de'biit. LLOYD GEOROK
obligingly bridged latter portion of
dinner hour with blatant denunciation of
all things British, exaltation of all things
Boer. Frantic cheers of Irish sympathisers
with England's enemies drew in loungers
from the lobby, students from the library,
philosophers from the smoking-room.
Constant stream of diners-out flowed in.

Itoviviiifj " n certain splendid memory."
When young CHURCHILL rose from corner
seat of bench behind Ministers, obligingly
lent by CAP'EN TOMMY BOWLES, he faced,
and was surrounded by, an audience
that filled the Chamber. No friendly
cheer greeted his rising. To three-
quarters of the audience he was personally
unknown. Before he concluded his third
sentence he fixed attention, growi ng keener
and kinder when, in reply to whispered
question, answer went round that this was
RANDOLPH CHURCHILL'S son.
Nothing either in voice or manner
recalls what WINSTON in delicate touch
alluded to as " a certain splendid memory.''
He has, however, the same command of
pointed phrase; the same self-possession
verging, perhaps, on self-assurance; the
same gift of viewing familiar objects from
a new standpoint; the same shrewd, con-
fident judgment. Instantly commanding
attention of the House, he maintained it
to the end of a discourse wisely brief.
Pretty to see SQUIRE OP MALWOOD watching
him with pleased, fatherly smile; PRINCE
ARTHUR, with glowing countenance,
keenly listening from the opposite bench,
doubtless thinking of days that are no
more, feeling again the touch of a
vanished hand, faintly hearing the sound
of a voice that is still.
The Member for SARK remembers over
the waste of nearly a quarter of a cen-
tury GRANDOLPH'S maiden speech. He
rose from the bench behind that from
which WINSTON spoke. In those days he
did not assume the prominence of a corner
seat, content to find a place somewhere
about the middle of the Bench. He had
plenty of room to choose, for the House
was not half full. The occasion was one of
CHARLES DII.KE'S crusades against small
boroughs. In course of his speech he had
alluded disrespectfully to Woodstock, the
family borough for which GRANDOLPH, not
then scorning the ways of ducal cadets,
was content to sit. The speech created
little attention, save among two or three
close observers who recognised the flash
of genius in the unconventional utterance.
Not the most friendly and sanguine
listener dreamt of the future career of
the young man who, having made an end
of speaking abruptly the left House and
was not heard again till after long
interval.
Very different fortune attends his son
when, twenty-six years later, he makes
his maiden speech. WINSTON must see to
it that the reversion of circumstance is
not followed all along the line. The
father began on a low level, and stormed
the topmost towers of Ilium. The sou
springs into notice from a lofty plane, and
will be expected to preserve his attitude.
To which end SARK, nothing if not
practical, warns him to be chary of con-
tribution to debate, at least, through his
first session. Better to have the House
of Commons wondering why you don't
speak, than marvelling why you do.
Business done. — Still talking round
Address. Accent chiefly Irish.
HERALDIC TALK.
Three Lions (first quarter). Can't see
what the dragon wants. But perhaps

the fourth corner as, say, the Irish harp.

DRAMATIC SEQUELS.
VIII.—THE VENGEANCE OF CASTE.
MOST people, in their day, have wept
tears of relief at the ending of T. W.
ROBERTSON'S comedy Caste, -when the Hon.
George D'Alroy—not dead, poor chap !—
falls into the arms of his wife, Esther,
while his father-in-law, Eccles, bestows a
drunken benediction upon him before
starting for Jersey, and his sister-in-law,
Polly, and her adored plumber, Gerridge,
embrace sympathetically in the back-
ground. In these circumstances it seems
hardly kind to add a further act to this
harrowing drama. But the writer of
Sequels, like Nemesis, is inexorable. If
the perusal of the following scene prevents
any young subaltern from emulating
D'Alroy and marrying a ballet-dancer with
a drunken father, it will not have been
•written in vain.
SCENE—The dining-room of the D'Al.ROYS'
house in the suburbs. Dinner is just
over, and GEORGE D'ALROY, in o seedy
coat and carpet slippers, is sitting by
tlie fire smoking a pipe. On the, other
side of the fire sits ESTHER, his wife,
darning a sock.
Esther. Tired, GEORGE?
George. Yea.
Esther. Had a bad day in the City?
George. Beastly! I believe I 'm the un-
luckiest beggar in the world. Every stock
I touch goes down.
Esther. Why don't yon give up specu-
lating if you 're so unlucky?
George (hurt). I don't speculate, dear. 1
invest.
Esther. Why don't you give up invest-
ing, then? It makes a dreadful hole in our
income.
George. One must do something for one's
living.
Esther {sighing). What a pity it is you
left the Army.
George. I had to. The regiment wouldn't
stand your father. He was always coming
to the mess-room when he was drunk, and
asking for me. So the Colonel said 1 'd
better send in my papers.
Esther (gently). Not drunk, GEORGE.
George. The Colonel said so. And he
was rather a judge.
Esther (unable to improve upon the
phrase in which, it will be remembered, she
was accustomed to excuse her father).
Father is a very eccentric man. But a
very good man, when you know him.
George (grimly). If you mean by "ec-
centric" a man who is always drunk and
•won't die, ho is. Most eccentric!
Esther. Hush, dear. After all, he 's my
father.
George. That 's my objection to him.
Esther. 1 "in afraid you must have lost a
great deal of money to-day!
George. Pretty well. But I 've noticed
that retired military men who go into the
City invariably do lose money.
Esther. Why do they go into the City
then?
George (gloomily). Why, indeed?
[There is a. short pause. GEORGF
stares moodily at the fire.
Esther. I had a visit from your mother
to-day.
George. How was she?
Esther. Not very well. She has aged
sadly in the last few years. Her hair is
quite white now.
George (half to himself). Poor mother,
poor mother!
Esther. She was very kind. She asked
particularly after you, and she saw little
GEORGE. (Gently) I think she is getting
more reconciled to our marriage.
George. Do you really, dear? (Looks at
her curiously).
Esther. Yes; and I think it 's such n
good thing. How strange it is that people
should attach such importance to class
distinctions!
George. Forgive me, dear, but if you
think it strange that the Marquise de St.
MAUR docs not consider Mr. ECCLES and
the GERRIDGES wholly desirable connec-
tions I am afraid I cannot agree with you.
Esther. Of course, Papa is a very ec-
centric man
George. My dear ESTHER, Mr. ECCLES
made his hundred and fifty-sixth appear-
ance in the police-court last week. The
fact was made the subject of jocular com-
ment in the cheaper evening papers. The
sentence was five shillings or seven days.
Esther. Poor Papa felt his position
acutely.
George. Not half so acutely as I did. I
paid the five shillings. If only he had
consented to remain in Jersey!
Esther. But you know Jersey didn't suit
him. He was never well there.
George. He was never sober there. That
was the only thing that was the matter
with him. No, my love, let us look facts
in the face. You are a dear little woman,
but your father is detestable, and there is
not the smallest ground for hope that my
mother will ever be "reconciled" to our
marriage as long as she retains her reason.
Esther. I suppose father is rather a
difficulty.
George. Yes. He and the GERRIDOES,
Between them, have made us impossible
socially.
Esther. What's the matter with the
ERR1DGES?
George. Nothing, except that you always
ask them to all our dinner parties. And
as gentlepeoplo have a curious prejudice
against sitting down to dinner with a
D! umber and glazier, it somewhat narrows
our circle of acquaintance.
Esther. But SAM isn't a working plumber
now. He has a shop of his own. Quite a
argeshop. And their house is just as good
as ours. The furniture is better. SAM
bought POLLY a new carpet for tho
drawing-room only last week. It cost
fourteen pounds. And our drawing-room
carpet is dreadfully shabby.
George. I 'ra glad they 're getting on so
well. (With a flicker of hope) Do you
think there's any chance, as they grow
more prosperous, of their "dropping"
us?
Esther (indignantly). How can you think
of such a thing!
George (sighing). 1 was afraid not.
Esther (enthusiastically). Why, SAM is
as kind as can be and so is POLLY. And
you know how fond they are of little
GEORGE.
George. Poor child, yes. He has played
with their children ever since he could
toddle. And what is the result? A
Cockney accent that is indescribable.
Esther. What does it matter about his
accent so long as he is a good boy, and
grows up to be a good man?
George. Ethically, my dear, not at all.
But practically, it matters a great deal.
It causes mo intense physical discomfort.
And I think it is killing my mother.
Esther. George!
George. Moreover, when the time comes
for him to go to a Public school he will
probably be very unhappy in conse-
quence.
Esther. Why?
George. Merely irrational prejudice.
Public school boys dislike all deviations
from the normal. And to them—happily
a pronounced Cockney accent repre-
sents the height of abnormality.
Esther (sadly). In spite of our marriage,
I 'm afraid you 're still a worshipper of
caste. I thought you turned your back
on all that when you married me.
George. So I did, dear, so I did. But
1 don't want to commit my son to the
same hazardous experiment.
Esther. Ah, GEORGE, you don't really
love me, or you woiddn't talk like that.
George. My dear, I love you to distrac-
tion. That's exactly the difficulty. I am
;orn between my devotion to you and my
abhorrence of your relations. When your
'ather returned from Jersey, and took a
edging close by us, nothing but the
warmth of my affection prevented me
'rom leaving you for ever. He is still
here, and so am I. "What greater proof
could you have of the strength of my
attachment?
Esther. Poor father ! he could not bear
;o be away from us. And he has grown
so fond of little GEORGE! (GEORGE shud-
ders.) Father has a good heart.
George. I wish he had a stronger head.
\This remark is prompted by the sound
of Mr. ECCLES entering the front
door, and hat<ing a tipsy alterca-
tion with the maid.
Maid (announcing). Mr. ECCLES.
Eccles (joyously). Evening — hie — mo

A DIFFICULT FEAT.
MR. CARNEGIE does not like football.
He says, " I do not approve of any game
in which men stamp upon each other
when they are down." Nor do we approve
of such practices, nor do we know how it
is done—even at football. "For men who
are down to stamp upon each other" is
clearly a feat which Mr. CARNEGIE alone
can explain.
THE EMPEROR'S QUANDARY.
[The Emperor of CHINA realises that his future
is a diplomatic toss-up. He must pay the indemnity,
and hare the ringleaders executed. In point of
fact, it is—taels he loses, heads we win.]
THE Chinese Emperor knit his brows
As his ministers came around him
With servile nods and extravagant bows,
His Li Hi'xo CHANGS and his great Pow-
wows,
In a terrible stew they found him.
Be speaks;
"The Powers are gathered about the Gate
And around the sacred wall.
Their anger I cannot one jot abate,
And I do not like, I am bound to state,
The look of affairs at all.
"We moved our Court to a quieter spot,
To think things carefully over.
But how to get out of our artful plot,
And how to unravel the Boxer knot,
Is a thing I can not discover.
I am sure you will hear with great sur-
prise
That we 're stumped for fresh excuses.
We have come to the end of our list of
lies,
And the Chinese Puzzle our wit defies.
In short, it the very deuce is.
For the Powers request an enormous lot
Of cash, as indemnity,
And the heads of the leaders of the plot.
But these gentlemen wire they would
rather not
With our modest request comply.
Of these two-fold evils we both must
choose,
As I shall exactly prove.
To accept their terms we cannot refuse,
But do you not sec how we stand to lose
Whichever the way wo move?
We pay the Indemnity: Taels they win.
It is heads we lose if we slay
The great ringleaders. Do you begin
To see what a terrible plight we 're in?
And to think, it's the only way!
A PRACTICAL SUGGESTION.
DEAR MR. PI;NCH,—If DK WKT be ever
caught I venture to suggest that, instead
of sending him to St. Helena or Ceylon,
he should be brought to England and
handed over to the Master of the Buck-
hounds, to be used as a deer in place of
the present quadrupeds. What rattling
runs he could give over the country round
Windsor, and what a saving it would be
to country in venison! Even Mr. LABBY,
M.P., the deadly opponent of the Buck-
hounds, could scarcely object to the
King's Boer-hounds.
Yours obediently,
PRACTICAL PETER.

SHOW-SEEING MADE EASY.
Now that London has tasted blood, so
to speak, and expects her weekly feast of
pageantry and procession, it may not be
amiss to throw out a few hints and sug-
gestions for the greatest happiness of the
greatest number of sightseers:—
1. That the pavements shall be scienti-
fically and permanently "raked," in the
theatrical sense, i.e. given a slant of not
less than twenty degrees down to the
roadway.
2. That, where the foregoing is imprac-
ticable, the roadway be raised at least
three feet, or, better still, be turned into
an American elevated track.
3. That all police, soldiers and volun-
teers lining the route, do so behind,
instead of in front of the crowd.
4. That the crowd arrange itself in sizes,
that is, all the short persons should stand
in the front rows, it being made a mis-
demeanour for a tall individual to block
the view of one of lower stature.
5. That m;ii im'-i- hats be ranked as a
felony, breach of the peace, or lese-
majest£, according to circumstances. The
wearers to be instantly removed in
custody and head-cuffed.
0. That better and safer accommodation
be provided in trees commanding the line
of procession—at present, ladies have
some difficulty in mounting even to the
lowest branches. Spiral staircases
round the trunk should therefore be
constructed, with proper hen - roosts
where available.
7. That the tops of lamp-posts be made
more accessible. Occupiers of such an
excellent vantage ground should no
longer be discouraged by insecurity of
tenure and foothold and the attentions
of the police.
8. That ladies shall not be hoisted on
gentlemen's shoulders under any pretext
whatever. Anybody shall be entitled to
run a pin into the offenders.
9. That babies be left at home, as the
supply of coroners is limited.
10. That the invention of the lady who
used a looking-glass on the occasion of
the Opening of Parliament on February
14 be developed, and the view be re-
flected into all the suburbs. This would
enable people to stay at home.
11. That all processions pass twice over
the course, on the principle of an over-
flow meeting. Those who have seen
the first time to go home at once.
12. That London be entirely rebuilt
and fitted with decent vistas, a la HAUSS-
MANN.
18. That their Gracious Majesties be
entreated to open something, Parliament
for choice, once a week. The Houses
needn't sit during the interval, as they
really appear to have outlived their use-

A BALLAD OF EDWARD GREY.
(After Tennysoji's pathetic poem, "Edward Gray"; and with
acknowledgments to the author o/ the famous proposition, liere
distorted from its original sense:—" Let us bury the hatchet
—in the bowels of our enemy! ")
[HisTOBic NOTE.—On February 20, Sir KOBEBT REID (sympathising with
the Boers) presided at a dinner of the Eighty Club given in honour of Sir
EDWABD OBEY (Imperialist). Pending the time when the clouds should
roll by, the Chairman thought it would help to clear the air if he confessed to
a marked difference of opinion, on a point of temporary interest, as between
himself and the guest of the evening. Sir EDWABD OBEY heartily endorsed
this sentiment. He further admitted that he had modified his admiration for
Mr. CHAMHERLAIX'S attitude. He deplored that gentleman's tendency to
allude to a section of the Liberal Party as Pro-Boers. The Liberal Party was
actually a very fine combination, with a remarkable future before it.]
C'Amors HARRIET CAMPBELL-B.
Sat on the fence in her well-known way;
"And where is your warrior's axe," she said,
"And have you buried it, EDWARD GREY?"
Cautious HARRIET spoke like that;
Slightly blushing I looked away;
"Cautious HARRIET, coals of flre
Lie on the scalp of EDWARD GitEV.
"BERTHA REID was my own true love,
Liberal both our hearts at core.
But I was British by taste, and she
Pro-(as I used to call her)-Bocr.
"Wrong I thought her, as she thought me;
Between our loves was a deadly breach;
We moved apart in neighbouring plots,
While you sat tight with a leg in each.
"Wingecl and khakied words I spake,
Once I suffered myself to say—
'You are too little an englander
To suit the habits of EDWARD GREY!'
"Several sporting things I did
Calculated to cause her pain;
Even toyed with the lustrous locks
Of gentle JOSEPHINE CHAMBERLAIN.
"But Wednesday last the Liberal Bond
Fed in my honour, and hearts were fresd;
And there to welcome me, in the chair,
Looking her best was BERTHA REID!
"' EDWARD GREY, we differ !' said she;
'So it would seem,' was my reply;
'Let us agree to differ,' she said,
And ' Certainly, BERTHA REID !' said I.
"Steadily fell the coals of flrc;
The course of EDWARD GREY was plain;
1 must contrive to depreciate
The charms of JOSEPHINE CHAMBERLAIN.
"' I thought her promising once,' I said,
'But that is my view no more, no more;
She called my beautiful BERTHA REID
A rude unmannerly name—pro-Boer!'
'' Frank was our laughter over the wine,
Frankly we spoke in generous vein;
That night we buried our hatchets in
The heart of JOSEPHINE CHAMBERLAIN.
"Right through her bosom of triple bronze
They cleft her heart like a thing of clay;
There lies the hatchet of BERTHA REID,
And the similar weapon of EDWARD GREY."

TARTAEIN A BRIGHTON.
LE NAUFRAGE.
l.i. lendemain la brume avait disparu, et le soleil, toujours
pale en Angleterrc, brillait entre les nuages. Le vent
soufflait rudement.
TARTARIN s'habilla vite, chercha sesamis, lesentraina dehors.
"Aliens," dit-il, "plus do brume, uno bonne brise, tout ce
qw'il nous faut, hein? Vitc, au port!" Alors les Tarasconnais
cherchaient a s'orientcr. Us voyaient toujours la grande
promenade et les cailloux de la plage.
"Diffe>emment," deraanda TARTARIN, "oil est done le
port?" "Probablement," dit BRAVIDA, "il n'y en a pas,
comme les antiquit^s, les monuments, les curiosites de la
ville." "Eh bien, alors," r^pondit TARTARIN, "nous allons
nous embarquer dans un de ces petits bateaux sur la plage
la-bas." "Impossible," crierent les autres, "par ce vent."
"Moi, j'irai," dit TAUTARIN simplement. "Vous n'osez
pas," fit BOMPARD. "Le President du Yackt Club de Taras-
con," repondit I'autre cl'un ton severe, "ne craint rien en
mer."
Et la-dessus le heros doscendit leiitement dc la digue,
aborda un batelier, et lui fit signe de lancer a la mer une
barque a voiles. Cette pavtie de la plage etait abritee par un
brise-lame. L'homme ob^it sans hesiter, croyant avoir affaire
a un marin distingue. Et pendant que TARTARIN attendait
tranquillement, PASCALON, les larmes aux yeux, le priait
instamment de ne pas risqtier sa vie. Mais TARTARIN ne fleehit
pas. TARTARIN seul, debout a cote du mat, la tete haute, et
le regard fler, gardait toujours son calme he>o'ique. De temps
en temps il regardait sa boussole, qu'il teuait a la main.
Poussee par le batelier, la barque glissa dans 1'eau, et un
instant apres TARTAHIN se cramponna au mat. Les Taras-
eonnais, moins inquiets, regardaient le petit bateau trnversant
1'eau calme '•; 1'abri du brise-lamc, et puis ils poussaient des
cris d'cffroi, car. k quelques metres de la plage, la barque coula,
renversee par les vagues.
Quel moment terrible! Leur illustre president naufrage, ce
heros du Midi noy6 dans la mer triste et grise du Nord!
Heureusement 1'eau n'eiait pas profonde, le batelier s'y
precipita et tira le grand homme hors des vagues. Ruisselant,
grelottant, le he>os tomba entre les bras de ses camarades. 11s
le porterent a une voiture. Arrive ii 1'hotel il se coucha
immediatement, et demanda, toujours grelottaut, des grogs
chauds. II en avala plusieurs et s'endormit.
Le soir il s'eveilla et se leva en sursaut. "Allons," dit-il,
"nous pouvons partir, je n'ai plus froid, cette fois je ne meurs
pas. Muis tout de meme je vous donne ma demission. Je ne
serai plus President du Yackt Club de Tarascon. Je ue serai
plusyacktman. J'enaisoupe. Les montagnes sont dangereuses,
les lions sont terribles, mais la mer—zou!—dans un yackt,
rien qu'une planehe entre vous et la mort—t£, \4 '.—elle me fait
peur! J'y renonce a tout jamais. PASCALON, prenez nia
boussole, et donnez-la au brave batelier qui ra'a sauve du
naufrage. Allons! La note, une voiture! Cam'effraye toujonrs,
ce bruit de la mer. Vite, a la gare! Pardi, on n'est pas noye
dans les trains au moins!"
Une heure plus tard ils quittaient Brighton. H. D. B.
His WAY OP DOING IT.—Admiral Sir E. R. FREEMANTLE writes
the preface to Mr. ARCHIBALD S. KURD'S pamphlet " The British

writing, but he wants also to be Kurd. .

TO THE KING'S PARLIAMENT.
SIRS, you are met—the nation's fato,
The nation's hopes arc in your keeping,
And you shall sit in high debate
While those you cater for are sleeping.
'Tis yours to wrack a weary head
In coining to a grave decision,
But not to lie at case in bed
And be subtracted from division.
And some shall wage the war of words
With skill, with wit and eke with passion,
Transforming kindness' milk to curds
As is the parliamentary fashion.
And some, compelling oft the storm
That agitates the usual teacup,
Will rant of grievance and reform,
Being all too swift to rise and speak up.
While others, TCWMIES in the ranks,
Seen but not heard shall keep their
places,
The partisans of leaders' pranks,
The saviours of their leaders' faces.
The whips shall hurry to and fro,
Much talk shall be and many a Question;
Xew policies shall come and go,
And all be merged in one congestion.
Of you our knowledge is but short,
But Parliaments have gone before you
And steered the ship of State to port,
Born of the parentage that bore you.
So let us .trust, as sure we must,
"When all is said and done and written,
That, as a fact, your every act
May honour Great and Greater Britain.
THE PERFECT LETTER-WRITER.
THE old-fashioned manuals gave ex-
amples of very simple letters to relatives
and employers, some few specimens of
business communications, and no more.
The growth of education during the last
thirty years and the multiplication of
means of travel have so vastly increased
the numbers of correspondents that it is
now necessary to give examples of letters
to personages in high places, to editors of
newspapers, to managers of railways,
to directors of public institutions, to
foreigners, and to others. Many of these
letters would be from persons in humble
positions, who have been instructed, but
not quite to this point, by the Board
Schools. Simple forms of letters are now
unnecessary. For instance, the first let-
ter, judiciously varied, might be
From a Young Man to his Grand/other, on
hearing of the latter'a Engagement.
MY DEAR GRANDFATHER, — With the
greatest pleasure I have received the
news that you are about to be married for
the fifth time. When I consider your
activity of body, in a bath-chair, and of
mind, when expressing your opinion of my
Uncle ADOLPHCS, your son-in-law, I may
confidently express the hope that you may
be as happy with, and may confer as much

happiness on, my future step-grandmother,
as you were with, and did confer on, my
grandmother SUSAN, and my step-grand-
mothers MARY, DORA, and ELAINE. I under-
stand that the lady's name is GWENDOLEN,
and that she is nineteen years of age. As
I have only seen her once, when, in the
absence of your valet, she brought yon
your evening arrowroot, it would be pre-
sumptuous for me to praise her personal
appearance ; but I may truthfully say that
I have rarely noticed any other London
housemaid so remarkable as she for a rosy
complexion and a roundness of figure,
which together would have fascinated
RUBENS himself.
With my heartiest congratulations and
every good wish, I remain your affectionate
grandson, THOMAS WROTTfR.

Or through the fields of " Martian ire "?
Wouldst stroll by Venus' berg or dell?

Short stories with sad endings.
III.—THE LOVE STORY OF AN AMBITIOUS
"WOMAN.
REGINALD MAINGAY arose out of an
attitude of genuflection. His nervous
clutch was about tho brim of his silk bat,
his demeanour the excess of blushing
awkwardness.
"Then," he said, in quavering notes.
"I 'in—1 'm not good enough
for you? A regular bad penny.
Won't have me at any price.
I—I shall como into ten thou-
sand a-year, you know."
A strange, dancing light came
into the young girl's eye (the
right eye, I think).
"It is not that," she said.
"Oh, we all have faults, I know.
I do not want to be harsh or
unkind—but"
"I see," said REGINALD,
dolefully. "I 'm a bit of a
"But you will improve?"
said the girl, half-appealingly.
"I will study hard to be
more deserving of your love—
when you bestow it on me. I 'm
not worthy of you, but if I had
a little encouragement—just the
faintest glint of hope," and he
paused, and blinked out his
pent-up emotion.

He scarcely realised, so mysterious are
the workings of love—what a marked
change this young girl had effected in
him. Even she doubted—the result was
so utterly beyond anything her most
ambitious hopes had formed.
"You havegivenup drinking? " shesaid.

"In a year and a day," she
said dramatically, "I will
answer yon."
The lover accepted the
period of probation, and the
young girl who had read of tho follies,
the undurability, and .the ever cropping
up of hitherto unconsidered short-corn -
ings in Man, congratulated herself that
she, at any rate, would have a husband
adaptable to the lightest whim of her
feminine fancy. For one year and one
day REGINALD would be under her close
surveillance, and well she knew that her
charms were all sufficient to feed the
flame of love in REGINALD MAINGAY'M bosom
until such time as her good influence had
transformed the awkward boy, with his
selfishness and objectionable bachelor
vices, into an eligible husband.

HOW TO WRITE FOR PVXCH, THE
TIMES (OR ANY OTHER PAPER).
(By one who IMS done it.)
A NUMBER of volumes have been pub-
lished of late with such titles as The Com-
plete Guide to Successful Journalism, How-
to write for the Magazines, etc. But, so
far as we know, none of these works
contains hints to the innumerable aspi-
rants who wish to write for Punch—a
task demanding, of course, quite excep-
tional powers. The following hints on
this important matter are sure to bo
widely welcomed.
1. The first thing is to flnd an appro-
priate subject. There is no difficulty at
all about this. Select a well-known joke
from any Jest-Boot, or take one from a
back number of Punch itself. Perhaps
yon have been taught that originality is
prized by editors; in that case you should
compose a ten-thousand-words essay on
"Molecular Attraction," or "The Burial
Customs of the Ancient Hittites." No-
thing like this, as you will justly point
out to the Editor, has ever appeared in
his periodical, so that he is bound to
welcome it.
2. You will then write your article on
foreign note-paper, taking care to use
both sides. And rememl>er, that an ille-
gible handwriting is a sure sign of
genius.
8. With the manuscript you will enclose
a lengthy letter, giving a few reasons
why the Editor must feel bound to use
your contribution. Any one of the follow-
ing is highly recommended:
(a) That five years ago a letter of
yours on the town drainage - system
was published by the Piiddleton
Gazette.'
(b) That you recently met at a garden-
party a man who knew a man whose
second-cousin's husband is on uodding-
terms with the Editor.
(<•) That you have an elderly relation
to support, or that your family is very
numerous.
(d) That extremely feeble as you be-
lieve your contribution to be, it is at
least better than anything printed in
Punch within the last ten years.
4. If you do not get a handsome cheque
by return of post, you will write an angry
letter to the Editor, demanding the reason
of this disgraceful delay. Should he still
remain silent, you will follow it up by
other letters, varied by abusive postcards.
Then you will call three or four times a
day for a month at the office, Mr. Punch's,
The Times, or whatever the paper may be

FROM WEST TO EAST.
(Page from a Business-Man's Diary.)
Monday.—Attended meeting of Patent
Thunderbolt Company. Board perfectly
satisfied with manager's report. Didn't
understand it. Didn't like to say so.
Others understood it, so it must lie all right.
Tuesday.—Looked in at the gathering of
theAntipodean Tube Connecting Syndicate.
Man in chair seemed to know something
aboutit. Intelligent man, and clear-headed.
Passed him customary vote of confidence.
Wednesday.—Appeared at the Board of
the Moribund Life Assurance. Rather
late for the statement, but in time for the
fees. Asked what had been done. Com-
pany Director replied "Oh, the usual
business." Appeared disappointed at my
arrival, as, had I not put in an appe:-.;'-
ance, Company directors would have
divided my fee. Things seem to be going
well. Lunched at the Club.
Thursday. — Turned up at the Consoli-
dated Spanish Aerial Castle Combination.
Report in every way satisfactory, as far
I can make out. But I never had a head
for figures. However, I quite under-
stand that oar " prefs.," i.e. " preference
shares," are at a premium, and are ex-
pected to go higher.
Friday.—Popped into the Board Meeting
of the Undiscovered Island Development
Company. All-going well according to
the experts; but I admit, as I said to a
companion director, that geography and
minerals were never among my strong
points at school. By the way, at Uni-
versity never did any geography. Nobody
ever did. Quite forgotten if -we had any
maps.
Saturday.—A day off. Vote myself into
my arm-chair before fire, and shall take up
Encyclopaedia to get out of it some infor-
mation as to Thunderbolts, Tubes, Castles-
in-Air, geography and mineralogy gener-
ally Can't flnd Encyclopaedia —
suppose I haven't got one. Old golfing
friend calls for me to run down with him
to Sandwich Links from Saturday till
Monday. Good. Bother Directorates and
Directories. All comes right if you don't
worry. That's my motto, and a good one.
Off. Back in time to get fees on Monday
at the meeting of Patent Thunderbolt
Company (Limited).
bution is, after all, an irrelevant detail.
"A Shorter Way."—Address a letter to
the Publishers requesting them to forward
you a copy of Punch, for which you enclose
stamped and addressed wrapper. This is
"writing for Punch" reduced to its very
simplest form, and the plan is adaptable
to any and every form of journal.

REGULAR IMPOSITIONS. — Mr. GAZE, for
America, would impose duty on Russian
imports. Thereupon M. WlTTE would
impose duty on American imports into
Russia. Isn't this a striking instance of
"Ready Witte"?

O FABLED Apollo of maritime RHODES,
If you could behold this Imperial Isle,
And see who presides o'er our latter-day
nodes,
You could not forbear with amusement
to smile.
Like Atlas of old, on his shoulders he bears
The burden of state; granting chary
assent
To kingly decrees, on his country's affairs,
Or yielding faint praise with admonish-
ment blent.
Kings, Emperors, Czesars some title abate
To their greatness, beshrouding their
emblems of power,
And on his sweet pleasure content are to
wait.
Or—haply, l>encath his fell anger to
cower.
Ambassadors, diplomats, plenipots., all
This Cerberus strive to appease with a
sop,
Full knowing his pow'r to procure their
recall,
If he, by design or chance, on them
should drop.
He shows each new Member the path to
pursue,
Inculcates his duties, imposes his plan
Of political action the whole session
through;
And trumpets his views from Beersheba
to Dan.
He lays down the laws for our Naval
defence:
His voice through the War-Office echoes
amain;
He argues his rights with a vigour intense;
He booes in the theatre with cheerful
disdain;
O'er vestry, o'er council, o'er newly-made
movement
Still does he the wand of authority
•wield;
He weaves aery webs for some Body's
improvement;
The soldier instructs in his duties afleld.

And the ha'penny papers without inter-
mission
For his favour and nod of approval
compete.
The great British Empire is — by kind
permission
Of him I refer to —The Man in the
Street!

"On, JAMB ! .TANE! WHAT win. YOUR MASTER SAY!"

SRE mighty Hattersea arise,
An awe-inspiring suburb,
Quite peaceful, save for coster's cries
Of rabbits or of rhubarb.
(Excuse that rhyme.) This stately place
Displays its awful power,
And dooms to dire and deep disgrace
The Ministers who cower.
Of course they tremble. Dare they stand,
Like lightning-scorning AJAX,
Defying Battersea's command,
And still in office stay Jacks?
Ah, no! The Ministry must fall,
And not because it blundered,
Unless it can obey the call
S. W. has thundered.
It can't obey, so what is claimed
By Battersea is cruel;
The Government, abashed, ashamed,
Must die in such a duel.
O Conscript Fathers round that Park
Where bicyclists go riding,
To pity's gentle pleading hark
And cease your angry chiding!
If all the Ministers went out,
How could you take their places?
Your valuable time, no doubt,
Is lllled in many cases.
Could you neglect South-Western shops
To rule the British nation?
Then leave to others, till it stops,
That humbler occupation.

CANTO THE SECOND.

The Libretto.

WE left the authors and composers too,
But, for a while, the latter have to rest;
At present there is nothing they can do,
Though later on for time they may be pressed;
So your attention let me kindly ask
For the librettists, in their thankless task.
Thankless, I say, because, as well they know,
There is so much hard work to do at first,
Which into nothingness will doubtless go
As soon as it begins to be rehearsed.
And, when the shadow of their work remnins,
They get condemned by critics for tkeir pains.
And here a word in season let me speak:
Who is to bliiine, and in a large dt-gree,
That these librettos are so often weak'.'
Surely the unintelligent B. P.
What use in writing subtle epigram'!
The line that gets most laughter is a " D—ti!"
So then the authors, if they know the ropes,
Must not rely upon their verbal wit;
A first-night audience may raise false hopes
By seeing and appreciating it.
But afterwards, though suinc good lines rr.a~
"go,"
You '11 find this is not generally so.
Important to a very large extent
Is the locale wherein they lay their plot;
It may bo one they 've chosen to invent,
Or, on the other hand, it may be not.
The point is, that the scenic artist gets
A chance of painting some effective "sets."
The piece will be divided into acts,
Two in tlie number most in vogue to-day
(Though change of dress and scenery distracts
Attention from the dtilness of a play).
And the finale to the first will be
The one dramatic opportunity.
The thread of story in this fort of play,
By song and dance is often being stopped;
So ill the second act, 1 think it may
To all intents be absolutely dropped.
And the denouement—if there 'a one at all,
Can take place hurriedly at curtain-fall.
But more of this anon ; come, reader, now
Ravenons it uos inoiitons for a bit;
The authors, rather cramped, yet knowing how
They must proceed if they would make a hit;
Working upon the lines I 've tried to show,
Cj.icoct an up-to-date scenario.
When the scenario is complete, the authors will read it to tin
Manager, who will suggest countless alterations which may o
may not coincide with their views. For instance, one of the
characters in the piece may be a young girl,—essentially
refined and charming.
"Ah!" says the Manager, "just the part for Miss ASTERISK.'
Now, Miss ASTKRISK is a sprightly serio-comic from the halls
who has gained popularity by singing risque songs with
cockney accent. Therefore, consternation and expostulatio
on the part of the authors.
"Nonsense, my boys; she must have the part. Look at th

And so on. till the authors abandon mr.ny of their fonder

schemes to the necessity of "writing round the cast." How-
ver, let us presume that, subject to these trifling alterations,
ic scenario is approved and the authors are told to "go

Now are they fairly started on their task,
Tho framework of their vessel has been laid;
But, before very long, they '11 have to ask

The choruses,—fair sailing have they here,
Trios, duets, concerted pieces too;
Some may be " cut " and never used, I fear,
Others may last the many changes through.
The songs—well, better leave them for a
while,

Surely we ought to excuse them, if they
Give themselves airs now and then!

masterpiece of musical comedy ought to make rapid progress.
The difficulties of "writing round the cast " have been already

their peculiarities, which it is the author's duty to study
closely and endeavour to suit. P. O.

For once we '11 waive the stichomuthia.
First Prof. Sirs, of your Romeo and his offence
We have considered duly, weighing each
Small circumstance that haply might excuse
His so black crime. You murmur. Crime it is,
According to the sacred laws of Bangor,
Where none may court a maid, nay, not so much
As change a word with her, unless the twain
Be formally betrothed. Yet Romeo—
Himself denies not—through the streets at eve
Escorted Juliet, yea, unblushing, came
E'en to the portals of her hostel here.
For this no palliation can we find,
NOT semblance of excuse why wo should stay

Must also leave the college.
(Renewed uproar, winch finally resolves itself into a elionm of

You hear? You hear? It's perfectly clear.
Our Romeo they banish;
And Juliet, too, that adorable Blue,
Has likewise got to vanish.
Oli, shame! Oh, shame! If that is your game,
You may play it, of course, if you like, Sirs:
But, first of all, pray, hear what we have to say—

Your voice unheard. Beware us!
Your oldest joke will not provoke
The shade of a smile.
Profs. Oh! spare us!
Student. Your lecture will fall on a dead brick wall:
However you may prepare it,
No looked-for applause will greet each clause
Profs. Enough ! we cannot bear it!
Student. You yield?
Profs. We do. And what of you?
Student. You '11 wink at the laws?

VEGETARIAN VERSES.
O MljSE! inflate mo with celestial fire,
Let all my baser particles expire,
And deign to smile upon me, though the ire
Of those who drag Old England through the mire
By slaying beasts to glut a mad desire
Should overwhelm me with convulsion dire.
How passing mad is man! And who can doubt
That all his woes, and maladies, from gout
To mumps, and measles of the German breed.
Arise from his carnivorousness and greed.
What can create a thief
But beef?
What is it animates the glutton?
Why, mutton.
The murderer sticks his fork
In pork,
And how exceedingly unpleasant
Is he that feasts on pheasant!
If Englishmen are down upon their luck,
Attribute it to duck.
War-clouds above, the atmosphere is murky
Through eating turkey,
And many a suicide selects the fatal cartridge
Through partridge.
What thing supremely stamps this heartless "profit and
loss" age?
—The awful sausnge!
() happy Hindoo!
How I venerate you.
For killing of cattle you wholly eschew,
Which is so much the better I think for the " coo,"
To vary what STKPHKNSON said to pooh-pooh
Certain pessimist views which were sadly untrue.
Then the heathen Chinee,
How blessed is he!
Can you picture him peacefully swilling his tea,
And swallowing rice with exuberant glee?
But, if he foolishly forsake that diet
Js'o " power" (or set of " powers ") can keep him quiet.
Inspired by pig and puppy he will burn
And massacre and slay at every turn;
So, gentle reader, be advised, and shun
All food that's more exciting than a bun;
Intoxicating flesh, you may have gleaned,
Will speedily transform you to a fiend.
Be warned in time, and try the better plan
Of turning to a vegetar-i-an.
The soul upon the tender cabbage reared
Is certain to be honoured, loved, revered!

OXFORD ODES.
VIII.
WHEN time was refusing to fly,
And the Dean was especially stale
(It was frequently said
That our excellent Head
Was blind to the point of his tale),
When even the clouds became dry—
Though our spirits they clamped for all
that—
Our glances would fall
On a bench in the Hall
Where two damsels from Somervillesat.
The one was a dream of delight,
Instinct with a delicate grace,
With cheeks soft and dimply—
In short, it was simply
A rapture to look on her face.
The other a regular fright,
Green-goggled, and forty at least,—
So we thought it our duty
To call the one Beauty,
While t'other was known as the Beast.
Now, the Beast had a studious mind:
Her thoughts were intent on the Head,
And in shorthand she wrote
An elaborate note
Of the least little word that he said.
Her brow was well wrinkled and lined,
As though with historical dates,
And we one and all knew
That this terrible Blue
Was a "cert " for a first in her Greats.
But Beauty, sweet innocent, seemed
To set on the lecture small store:
To judge from her look,
She apparently took
The worthy old Dean for a bore.
We thought that in fancy she dreamed
Of love or the joys of the ball;
"Why, why," we all said,
"Vex her dear little head?
She will only be ' gulfed*' after all."

The wisdom of mortals is nought,
And even the youngest man makea
What we -venture to view
(With all respect due
To omniscient youth) as mistakes.
Of all things, as Euripides thought,
To comprehend woman 's the worst;
The Beast was found fit
For the bottomless pit,
While Beauty came out with a first.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW GENIUS OF STRATFORD-ON-AVON.
(Lines suggested by the remarks of a local
guide, radiant with reflected glory.)
THE more I live and look about
The more it seems surprising
That men -who might hare made a name
Should miss the full re-ward of fame
For -want of advertising.
Authors, especially, I see
Addicted to the habit
Of hiding their effulgent light,
And keeping somewhere out of sight
In burrows like a rabbit.
Of how they privately behavo
The journals make no mention;
Their facial cast remains in doubt,
They feed in public spots without
Attracting wide attention.
Even the Bard of Avon chose
To play the homely brewer,
To nurse a quiet love of pelf
And never talk about himself
To any interviewer.
Our faith in his reputed works
Is naturally shaken,
With no contemporary puff
To tell us if he wrote the stuff
Or got it done by BACON.
I wonder if some Philistine,
Some impious child of DAOON,
Will, in the course of time, discuss
Who was the actual Genius
That penned Tlie Master Pagan!
Will curious cryptogrammatists
Join the insensate melee,
To prove that Mr. CAIXK (of Man)
Wrote it to please the Great God Pan,
And called himself C-R-LU?
Not if our M-RIK'S clear reclame
Shall still survive to boom her I
And I believe it will not be
False shame or foolish modesty
That lets the moth consume her!
A happy thought, to take a house
In SHAKSPEARE'S own locality,
Where frequent pilgrims pass the door
And cannot very well ignore
Her poignant personality!
The Yankee, streaming to the shrine
Of our immortal Mummer,
Forgets the dead and doubtful "Swan,"
And concentrates his worship on
The real and living Hummer.
The showman, sick of shady myths
And dearth of life-recorders,
Explains that this is not the way
A grateful Stratford treats to-day
The prophet in her borders.
"Behold," he cries, "the actual hcwsw
That Miss C-R-LLI leases,
In yonder study's restful shade,
Accepting none but Heaven's aid,
She makes her masterpieces.
"Such the retirement suited to
A theologic scholar!
Screened from the idle curious throng
To her we might apply the song
'Go, lovely rose!' (by WAJAER).
"Hard by she builds a worthier home,
And, when she seeks that haven,
Upon the walls where now you gaze
The Mayor of Stratford means to raise
A tablet chastely graven :—
Within this temple, which has been
Presented to the nation
(Here follows name of Mayor, with date),
Occurred a portion of the great
C-R-LLI'S inspiration." O. S.

THE NEW STAR, AND WHAT WILL
COME OF IT.
(A report received from the Milky Way.)
"WHAT shall we do?" cried Jupiter
from afar, using the wireless telegraphy.
"I have already bestowed a magnificent
army, that will go any where and do any-
thing," replied Mars.
"And I," put in Neptune, not to be
outdone in generosity, "have given a
first-class navy that can meet that army
anywhere and conquer it."
"I have bestowed a perfect bevy of
beauties, who will cause any number of
cases to be ready for trial by battle,"
said Venus, with a love of mischief
suitable to her sex.
"And I have given a messenger system
equal to anything at St. Martin's-le-
Grand," murmured Mercury, not feeling
sure that his gift would be valued.
"That is not very much," sneered
Saturn; "and I can do a little better.
My ring is already on its way through
space."
"Ring I " thundered Jupiter. "A pretty
present, indeed! "Why, the poor little
star will be hopelessly ruined if it has
anything to do with a ring I I "ve half a
mind to crush it at its birth with a
thunderbolt."
"It will reach maturity before your
messenger arrives," returned Mercury,
who had a taste for figures.
Jupiter considered a moment, and then
gave judgment.
"Well, let us see how matters go.
Wars, beauties, an imperfect postal ser-
vice, and a commercial ring from Saturn
to swallow up everything."
"Oh, dear me!" cried the new star.
"I don't believe, with such extra-
ordinary gifts, I shall be any better off
than that poor old world the Earth!"
THE PERFECT LETTER-WRITER.
PART II.
From an Organ-grinder to the Principal of
the Guildluill School of Music.
SIR,—Reluctant as I am to trespass upon
your valuable time, I cannot refrain from
pointing out to you the irreparable injury
which your institution, together with the
Royal College and the Royal Academy of
Music, may ultimately cause to the pro-
fession of which I am a member. I do
not in any way blame you, or the gentle-
men controlling the other establishments,
but I think you cannot deny that in
time, through your mis-directed efforts a
majority—no doubt a small majority—of
the English nation, or, at least, of the
inhabitants of London, will become so
prejudiced in favour of the sort of instru-
mental music which you, and others like
you, advocate, that the performances
given by members of my profession will
no longer be universally appreciated and
admired, as they are at present, and as
they deserve always to be. In fact—but
of that, happily, there is so far no sign
whatever—London may ultimately sink
to the level of Brussels, or any other
third-rate capital, where the instrument
on which I perform is absolutely pro-
hibited.
Far distant be the day when so-called
"education" may teach the Londoner to
wish for some trifle by CHOPIN or SCHUBERT
played on the digital pianoforte, rather
than an air from the music-halls rendered
on the mechanical one! At present it is
evident that the noble English nation
prefers the street organ to any other
instrument, for the members of my pro-
fession are welcomed to your great cities
in a manner unknown in other countries.
I have another subject of complaint.
As those who play the piano with their
fingers increase in number, the noise
caused by them in summer, when the
windows are open, becomes every year a
greater interruption to the enjoyment of
the music performed on the piano by
members of my profession, with the
infallible accuracy and perfectly correct
time only obtainable by the use of
mechanism. Your own institution, being
somewhat retired, causes us little annoy-
ance. But I shall never forget the first
time that I passed the Royal Academy of
Music on a hot day. I entered Tenterden
Street, a quiet turning such as I prefer,
and no sooner had I done this than so great
a noise of digital pianoforte playing burst
upon my ears that I turned and fled.
It is difficult for me to suggest any
remedy for the growing evils of which I
complain, unless it were a heavy tax upon
all non-vehicular instruments of music,
but I feel it my duty, on behalf of my
profession, to enter a protest, and I am,
Sir, your obedient servant.

[MARCH 6, 1901,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OMAR AND OH MY!
A DRAMATIC EXPERIMENT.
[It is said that a drama founded upon the
Rub&ijat of Omar Khayyam, as rendered into
English by FITZOEBALD, has been written in the
United States and will shortly be given on the stage.
Mr. Punch hastens to present a rival version.]
SCENE—Courtyard of the deserted palace of
JAMSHYD, canopied by that inverted
bowel commonly culled the sky. To
right, <i tavern—not deserted. To left,
a potter's house. At back, the grave
of BAHRAM, whence a sound of snoring
proceeds. A wild asx stamps fitfully
upon it. It is four o'clock in the
morning, and the "false dawn" shows
in the sky. In the centre of the stage
stand a lion and a lizard, eyeing each
other mistrustfully.
Lion. Look here, do you keep these
courte, or do I?
Lisard (resentfully). I don't know. I
believe we both keep them.
Lion (sarcastically). Do you? Then 1
venture to differ from you.
Ll*ard. Perhaps you'd rather we took
turns?
Lion. Oh, no, I wouldn't. I mean to
have this job to myself.
[Ho and the lizard close in mortal
combat. After a gallant struggle
the latter is killed, and the lion
proceeds to eat him. Suddenly a
shadowy form issues from the
a in iii- at back of stage.
Lion. BAHRAM, by Jove! Confound that
jackass. (Bolts remains of lizard and
then bolts himself, pursued by shadowy
form.)
Wild Asa. They said I couldn't wake
him. But I knew better! Hee-haw!
(Exit in triumph.)
[A sound of revelry becomes noticeable
from the tavern. A crowd gathers
outside. The tioice of OMAR, rather
tipsy, is heard.
Omar. When all the temple—hie !—is
prepared within, why nods the lousy
worshipper outside?
[A cock crows, and the sun rises.
Crowd (shouting in unison). Open then
the door. You know how little while we
have to stay. And, once departed, good-
ness only knows when we shall get back
again!
Omar (opening the door and appearing
unsteadily on the threshold). You can't
come in. It's—hie—full.
[Closes door again.
Crowd. I say, what rot!
[Exeunt, depressed.
Kightingale (jubilantly from tree). Wine!
wine! Red wine!
Rose (from neighbouring bush, much
shocked). My dear, you know I have
always been a total abstainer.
Nightingale. So you have. But every
morning brings a thousand roses. After
, you're che'ap. JAMRHYD and I like
our liquor, and plenty of it.
Rose (shaking her head in disapproval).
[ 've heard he drank deep.
Nightingale. Of course he did. You
should have seen him when HATIM called
;o supper! He simply went for it!
Bose (blushing crimson). How dreadful I
Nightingale (contemptuouslg). I dare say.
But you wouldn't be so red yourself if
some buried Csesar didn't fertilize your
roots. Why, even the hyacinth's past
sn't altogether creditable, and as for
;r.iss—why, I could tell you things about
lie grass that would scare the soul out
of a vegetable.
.Rose (annoyed). I 'm not a vegetable.
Nightingale. Well, well, I can't stay to
argue with you. I've but a little time
ii flutter myself. [£.rU on the wing.
Enter OMAR from tavern. He is by
thin time magnificently intoxicated
and is leaning on the arm of a
fascinating SAKI. He has a jug of
wine in his hand.
Omar (trying to kiss her). Ah, my be-
loved, fill the cup that clears to-day of
past regrets and future fears. To-
morrow! Why to-morrow 1 I may be
Sdki (interrupting). I know what you 're
going to say. To-morrow you '11 be sober.
But you won't. I know you. Go home!
Omar. Home! — hie. What do I want
with home? A book of verses under-
neath the bough, a jug of wine, a loaf
of bread—no, no bread, two jugs of wine
—and thou (puts arm round her waist)
beside me singing like a bulbul.
[Sings uproariously.
For to-ni(tht we '11 mem be!
For to-night
Sdki. Fie! An old man like you!
Omar. Old! Thank goodness I am old.
When I was young I went to school and
heard the sages. Didn't learn much
there.' They said I came like water and
went like wind. Horrid chilly Band-of-
Hope sort of doctrine. I know better
now. [Drinks from the jug in his hand.
Sdki (watching him anxiously). Take
care. You '11 spill it.
Omar. Never mind. It won't be wasted.
All goes to quench some poor beggar's
thirst down there (Points below.) Dare
say he needs it—hie.
Sdki (shocked). How can you talk'so!
Omar (growing argumentative in his
cups). I must abjure the balm of life, J
must I I must give up wine for fear of—
hie— What is it I 'm to fear? Gout,
I suppose. Not I! [Takes a?iother drink.
Safci (trying to take jug from him)
There, there, that's enough.
Omar (fast losing coherence in his e.v-
treme intoxication). I want to . talk 1i
yon about THEE and ME. That's what
want to talk about. (Counting on his
fingers.) Yon see there's the THEE ii
ME and there 's the ME in THEK. That's
myshticism, that is. Difficult word to
say, mysticisbm. Must light lamp and
see if I can't find it. Must be somewhere
about.
Sdki. You 're drunk, that's what you
are. Disgracefully drunk.
Omar. Of course 1 'm drunk. I am
to-day what I was yesterday, and
xvmorrow I shall n*ot be less. Kiss me.
Sdfci (boring his ears). I won't have it,
I tell you. I 'm a respectable SAKI; and
you 're not to take liberties, or I '11 leave
you to find your way home alone.
Onuir (bceo7ning maudlin). Don't leave
me, my rose, my bullfinch—I mean bulbul.
You know how my road is beset with
pitfalls—hie !—and with gin.
Sdki (disgusted). Plenty of gin, I know.
You never can pass a public-house. .
Omar (struck with the splendour of the
idea). I say—hie !—let's fling the dust
aside, and naked on the air of Heaven ride.
I i 's shame not to do It!
[Flings off hat, and stamps on it by way
of preliminary.
Sdki (scandalised). If yon take anything
else off I shall call the police.
[Exit hurriedly.
Omar (terrified). Here, SAKi, come back.
How am I to find my way without you?
(A pause.) What's come to the girl? I
only spoke—hie—meta—pborically. Diffi-
cult word to say, meta — phorically!
(Longer pause.) How am I to get home?
Can't go 'lone. Must wait for someone to
come along. (Peers tipsily about him.)
Strange, isn't it, that though lots of
people go along here every day, not one
returns to tell me of the road. Very
strange. S'pose must sleep here ....
S'posc [Rolls into ditchand falls asleep.
Tlie curtain falls for a moment. When it
rises again, day is departing and it is
growing dark. OMAR is still in his
ditch. The door of the potter's house,
to the left of the stage, is open, the
potter having betaken himself to the
tavern opposite, and the pots within
ar« arguing fiercely.
First Pot. Don't tell me I was only made
to be broken. I know better.
Second Pot. Even a peevish boy wouldn't
break me! The Potter would whack him
if he did!
Third Pot (of a more ungainly moke).
Depends on what he drank out of you.
Second Pot. What's that you say, yon
lopsided object?
Third Pot. That's right. Sneer at me 1
'Tisn't my fault if the potter's hand shook
when he made me. He was not sober.
Fourth Pot (I think a Sufi pipkin). It's
all very well to talk about pot and potter.
What I want to know is, what did the pot
call the kettle?
Third Pot (grumbling). I believe my
clay 's too dry. That's what's the matter
with me!
[The moon rises. A step is heard
without.

A SUGGESTION WITH SEVERAL
SHOCKS.
[" Llanl'yllin (Montgomeryshire) Town Council
were yesterday horrified by the suggestion that u
dramatic license should be granted to a London
agent for the presentation of musical dramas in the
Town Hall. Only one gentleman had the temerity
to support the application. The Council declined
to have anything to do with the unholy thing, and
the application was laid on the table."—Daily
Telegraph.}
SCENE FROM A PLAY FOR PURITANS.
SCENE—A Welsh Town Council. Around a
plain table are seated several councillors
in diverse pious attitudes. They are
all grave, formal, and severe in mien
and aspect, clad in sombre broad-
cloth and whiskers. One with sinful
daring rei'els in a tufted chin. Before
each is placed a glass of filtered water
indicating the purity of their discourse.
A murmur of indignation is with diffi-
culty suppressed. The councillor with
the tufted chin has just sat down. He
is purple in the face with shame and
vexation. A gentleman near him is
sobbing bitterly. Several councillors
are blowing their noses with Christian
violence. To an incidental accompani-
ment of snuffles, groans, and lamenta-
tions, Aldermnn JONES rises.

Alderman Jones (with great emotion and
a fanatic vigour of utterance). Fellow
townsmen and miserable sinners. Can I
believe Ay ears? Is it indeed true that a
lost soul from our iniquitous Capital has
had the temerity to enter this town?
A Muffled Voice. Impossible!
Aid. Jones. Enter this town, I repeat,
with the impudent, the degrading, the
truly horrible suggestion, that a dramatic
license should be granted for the repre-
sentation of musical dramas in the Town
Hall? [Tremendous sensation.
Several Councillors (in chorus). Alas!
Woe! Woe!
Aid. Jones (stemming a rebellious tear).
And that this diabolical scheme has the
support of an inhabitant of this town and
a member—alas, misguided and fallen!—
of this council? (Every eyeball is turned
with a synchronizing click on the unfortu-
nate possessor of the tufted chin. He,
overcome by the fear of some vengeful
Welsh Nemesis, slowly slides off his chair
and disappears beneath the council table.)
Oh, my friends, help me to quench this
growing spirit of levity. Assist me to
uphold the traditions of this exception-
ally moral town, wherein such a thing as
a short skirt or an indecorous knicker-
bocker has never penetrated. Think
what this terrible, this soul-excoriating
suggestion means. To see in our midst
an actor — (terrible excitement) — who
smokes cigarettes on a Sunday, and au
actress—a real actress—with rouge and
hare's-foot. (Awful, sepulchral groans.
One councillor, overcome by vertigo at the
thought of such an innovation, of seeing an
actress through anything but smoked glasses
and a respirator, splutters i» his glass of
water, and lias to be assisted out, stiJi
coughing and gurgling.) To have the name
of SHAKSPEARE—(patriotic hisses)—coupled
with our immortal Welsh bards. To hear
our children lisping the profane names of
WAGNER and OFFENBACH with our own
dearly - loved LLANWYLLGWYDFENELLYN.
(Yells of anguish.) My fellow-townsmen,
for years we have eschewed the naked
truth. Let us treat, then, with Welsh con-
tumely and municipal scorn this—this—
my tongue can scarcely be brought to
utter it—this bare suggestion.
[Seueral councillors are prostrated, and
the meeting breaks up as soon as the
morally-afflicted are sufficiently re-
covered.
PECULIAR TO MARS.
Latest Signals from the Red Planet.
No time wasted in Parliament.
Everyone satisfied, especially the
working-man—unable to comprehend the
meaning of strikes.
Farmers boast of continuous peace and
plenty.
Toleration reigns supreme everywhere.
No difficulty in obtaining respectable
domestics.
No black balls ever found in club ballot
boxes.
Newspapers absolutely reliable—sen-
sational paragraphs carefully barred.
Rational dress is the order of the day
and night amongst all classes of the com-
munity.
Latch-keys abolished.
Problem plays and musical monstrosi-
ties things of the distant past.

THE NEXT SPLASH VTEDD1XG;
Or, Hymen among the Billionaires.
(By Transatlantic Cable.)
As all the ceremonial arrangements of
forthcoming nuptial -matinees among the
Pour Hundred are now being stage-managed
and rehearsed some months previous, we
are able to present our readers with an
advance report of the morning performance
of a wedding-de-luxe which will be
enacted early nest April at the Vaudeville
Memorial Chapel of Xudeport (R.I.). It
will be a very quiet, but thoroughly toney
affair.
The high contracting parties are Miss
MAMIE GREENBACK, only daughter and
heiress of the late well-known financier
of "Wall Street, and Mr. OGDEN G. VANDE-
POT, America's richest young man, who has
recently amassed over 1,000,000,000 dols.
by a smart corner in freight-cars.
Miss MAMIE is a twentieth - century
blond of ultra c/iic appearance, who has
received the most expensive and exotic
education that Europe can provide, and
weighs 138 pounds. She is an expert
balloonist and base-ball player, manages
her father's banks single-handed, and has
taken the highest degrees possible in law,
medicine, pigkilling and laundry-work.
She has a complete set of gold teeth with
diamond fixings, and curls her hair every
night with five-hundred-dollar bills. Her
favourite colours are green (from her name)
and yellow (from the newspapers); and
she adores peanuts. Everyone considers
her a perfect peach.
Of the groom's career, we need only
say that he has been in the push ever
since the day he left his cradle to drive
his own motor-pram on Fifth Avenue.
Everyone knows the solid gold yacht
with which he intends to reach the North
Pole this summer, and his lapis-lazuli
cottage in the Adirondacks in which the
•five hundred millionaires were lost the
other day. O. G. wears an uphill smile,
and will go further still. There is not
much ice that he can't cut.
To avoid any appearance of a hippodrome
wedding, and to ensure perfect privacy
for the twenty thousand guests, the
Vaudeville Chapel will be raised from its
foundations for this occasion, and trans-
ported by means of a mammoth trolly on
to a monster raft, which will be moored a
mile from the shore. It will be reached
by a parqueted pontoon causeway, but, in
case any of the congregation elect to swim
the ^distance, the sea will be artificially
warmed and spread with oil for several
days beforehand. This will cost a hundred
million dollars at least. A fleet of steam-
tugs will whistle throughout the service
to keep order.
The sacred edifice will be draped from
steeple to basement in cloth of gold, and
the drop scene at the chancel-steps will
be formed of the rarest old green Gobelins

tapestry obtainable. The musical arrange-
ments are entrusted to Manager GRAU,
who will bring a trained choir of prima
donnas and choristers over from ROSTER
and BIAL'S. Bishop POTTER will pronounce
the benediction at the fall of the curtain.
All this will run into another hundred
million dollars.
Mr. VANDEPOT is to have a dozen best
men, supported by a hundred ushers in
gold-lined diving - costume, which will
come in handy, after the ceremony, when
real pearls are to be thrown instead of
rice. The groom himself will wear rubbers
of fine-spun platinum. These items figure
out at another hundred million.
The thirty-six bridesmaids will be taste-
fully attired in pointlace bathing-dresses
heavily jeweled at fabulous expense. The
bride's costume .... (here follow ten
columns of description, which we must
regretfully omit as also the account of
the sky-scraper cake with elevator in the
inside, and the unostentatious departure
of the happy pair in an airship, chased by
yellow reporters in balloons).

pleasant dinner at the " Star and Garter,"
and went homo at night feeling passing
oyful. Scarcely, however, hud I manipu-
ated my latch-key, with the help of a
>oliceman, when I was confronted by my
Commanding Officer, who, in tones of
sepulchral indignation enquired, " What's
he meaning of this, Mr. BITBBLETON?"
at the same time handing me a telegram
which read as follows: "Got rid of Sara
taken on Clara for you as desired, JOE."
I confess that for the moment I was
brgetfnl of the jargon of Capel Court,
and mumbled something about stupid
jractical joke. My hesitation increased
;he suspicions of my old Argus-eyed
)heasant, and even now, notwithstanding
rhat I have got a sworn affidavit from JOE
FoBBrNS as to the meaning of his despatch,
and have loaded her with fifty pounds'
worth of Spring gowns, she keeps me as
iight as a greyhound in a leash, and my
warmest protestations of undying affection
are met with such chilling remarks as:
'Is that the way yon addressed SARA?"
and "What a pity it is that CLARA can't
iave you!" However, to-day 1 got JOE
to write and say he had bought me a con-
signment of "Transvaal Devils," and this
lias sobered her a little.
Nevertheless, I am sure you will
agree with me that the sooner these
unmanly nicknames are abolished the
better for the peace of mind of such
innocent speculators as, yours dolefully,

ANYONE who appreciates good acting in a pretty and touch-
ing play will find the materials for enjoyment on visiting the
Court Theatre, where a dramatised version of MARION (not
"MARIAN," as the play-bill has it, which is adding insult to
injury, as Mr. Sam Weller observed on reading "Moses"
instead of "Samuel" prefixed to Pickwick on the way-bill of
the coach) CRAWFORD'S story, A Cigarette Maker's Romance,
adapted by Mr. CHARLES HANNAN, is now being given by Mr.
MARTIN HARVEY and his Company, with Mr. SYDNEY VALENTINE
added to the number. And a very powerful addition he is,
with a melodramatic situation at the climax of the piece that
forcibly reminds the "Old Hand" of that unrivalled scene,
where tho muffled drunkard, throwing off his disguise and
standing erect, declares himself to be "HAWKSHAW the Detec-
tive!" So Mr. SYDNEY VALENTINE (February must be his
lucky month, and the fourteenth his lucky day), by arrange-
ment with Messrs. HARRISON and MAUDE, gets a chance at the
Court which was not open to him at the Haymarket, and makes
the most of it.
Mr. MAKTIN HARVEY'S rendering of a most difficult character,
that of Count Skariatine, who is a bit "off his head," is
thoroughly artistic. It is so perfect as to excite the pity and
arouse the impatience of an audience that has begun to
sympathise with the poor, crazy creature, who, in the midst of
his supposed delusions, and in his agony of a broken memory,
is always a Christian gentleman, un chevalier, sans peur et sans
reproche. Mr. HARVEY'S is a very remarkable performance,
and he is ably seconded by Miss N. de SILVA, as the loving,
self-sacrificing, gentle-toned Viera. A clever company all
round. Mr. WILLIAM HAVILAND, as the villainous cousin—not
too villainous, but just villainous enough, will scarcely be
recognised by those who have seen him as the loyal Cavalier in
the first piece, Sweet Prue, written by CLAUDE DICKENS, which,
as being a capital little drama of forty-five minutes' duration,
beginning at eight o'clock, is a strong supplement to the bill.
In this piece Mr. LANDER, who is so good as Schmidt in The
Cigarette Maker's Romance, makes a striking figure of Major
Overton, as does Mr. FRANK VERNON of General Gaul.
Mrs. B. M. DE SOLLA given us a vigorous rendering of the
harsh, miserly, rancorous Akalina, mistress of the cigarette
factory; Miss CRETE HAHN is good as the giggling .Anna; and
Miss BESSIE ELDER as tho idiotic Augusta, with nothing to say
but plenty to do in tho way of tumbling about, is a sort of
German Tilly Sloivboy, only without any baby to take care of
and talk to.
Mr. MARTIN HARVEY'S art has probably considerable limita-
tions, but, so far as the very difficult character of Count
Skariatine is concerned, it is a masterpiece in miniature.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY or TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday Night, Feb. 25.
—Great day for CAP'EN TOMMY BOWLES.
In . spite of advancing years, a body
maimed in his country's service, secret
sorrow over the falling away (on to the
Treasury Bench) of his old comrade
CORPORAL HANDURY, and a general distrust
of the Government, the CAP'EN, ever on
the alert, forsome time has had his weather
eye on Gibraltar. Doubts wisdom of plan
of fortification. In Recess, whilst others
made holiday, the CAP'RN put up the helm
and steered his barque for Gibraltar.
Arrived there, saw at a glance what was
the matter. Our sapient custodians of
the Empire been spending millions on
works apparently specially designed to
meet convenience of enemies' fire. To-
night CAP'EN brought the subject forward
on Amendment to Address; demanded
enquiry and meanwhile stoppage of the
expensive, worse-than-useless work.
Expected things would take their usual
course. War Office would sneer at the
CAP'EN ; Admiralty would tell him to mind
his own business. "Instead of which"
PRINCE ARTHUR promptly rose, and, as the
CAP'EN put it, surrendered keys of
fortress; promised to appoint committee;
invited the CAP'EN to join it.
HANBHRY happened to be away; spared
the remorse born of abandonment of such
a leader. The BLAMELESS BARTLETT almost
breathless with admiration. A good deal
in what he says. Gibraltar one of the
chief bastions of the Empire. House of
Commons cheerfully voted millions for its
better defence. Two Governments have
carried on the work. Highest officers of
Army and Navy concerned in carrying it
out. As the BLAMELESS B. remarks, it is left
for a civilian—if he had remembered Our
Mutual Friend he would certainly have
quoted Mr. BOFFIN, " and with a wooden
leg "—to discover the flaw.
Business done.—Still debating Address.
Tuesday night.—"List of amendments to
the Address reminds me of the widow's
cruse," said the Member for Sark, turn-
ing over the almost endless folios. "Here
we are on the ninth day of Debate, and
paper fuller than ever."
Quite true. If Ministers pleased, De-
bate on Address might serve for full
business of Session. You may raise any
topic; it's all flsh that comes into the
net of the Address. One thing, however,
to place Amendment on paper; quite
another to find opportunity of moving it.
Of the more than forty Members who
proposed to discourse on divers subjects,
only four have been able to get on.
Night after night, SAM SMITH has been
seen in his place, lingering like the
grey mist on the early morning moor-
land. Wasn't Piccadilly at midnight this
time occupied his mind; nor had he at
heart reminiscences of naughty things
seen and said on the stage. Was con-
cerned about malpractices in the Church.
So was GREENE, K.C. GREENE, not a
Bencher of the Middle Temple for
nothing, proceeded by Bill. SAMCEL,
called early one morning, found on
opening his Orders of the Day that
GREENE, K.C., had brought in a Bill deal-
ing with Church Discipline. According to
Standing Orders, notice given to bring
in a Bill precludes prior discussion of
the subject matter upon a Resolution.
SAMUEL was dished. His discourse, al-
ready typewritten for convenience of
Alack! JOHN DILLON, that Parliamentary
lean kinc who, being on his legs, swallows
up everyone else's chance, was 1o the
fore. Caught SPEAKER'S eye last night at
a quarter to eleven; moved Amendment,
calling upon Government to make peace
with the gentle Boer on his own terms,
some apprehension that he would talk till
i half-past eleven, making it impossible to
dispose of Amendment at last night's
sitting. Three-quarters of an hour a
pretty good slice for private Member to
take out of a sitting.
"But we know our JOHN," said wearied
! Members. "He 's good for three-quarters
: of an hour " ; and they yawned in advance.

pounced. Still nearly two score amend-
ments on the paper. At least four score
Members, merely British, prepared to
take part in Debate on one or other.

war; started at hour's notice, abandoning
cheerful life in Paris to face hardships of
campaign. Distinguished himself in
several hard fights; mentioned in BOBS'
despatches. Apart from interesting per-
sonality, House would have welcomed his
testimony to things he had seen with his
own eves.
Turned out they didn't nearly know
their JOHN. When midnight struck he
was still on his legs. Tonight came up
quite brisk. WILLIAM O'BRIKN has had a
night to himself; REDMONI> afn^ has
delivered several1 speeches. TIM HBALY,
j in his unpatriotic way, has more than once
charmed crowded audiences with piquant
speech. Time Ireland should know JOHN
DILLON was around. So, having spoken
'for an hour and a-quarter last night, con-
tinued this evening through another hour,
with six minutes thrown in.
This spoiled all chance of his Amend-
ment being debated. But one can't have
everything, and JOHN had enjoyed himself
! for two hours and twenty-pne minutes by
Westminster clock.

SARK, regretfully. "When I first knew

passion for drink. Unresisted it grows

slave. There are Homes for the habitual
drunkard. Why shouldn't we have caves

Business done.—Address voted.
Thursday night.—Members came down
to-day a little low-spirited. Fresh Sup-
plementary Estimate circulated, asking
for additional three millions to meet
expenses of war conveniently concluded
on eve of dissolution last October ; brings
total amount up to ninety-five millions.
Remember how, on eve of war, SAGE
OF QI;EEN ANNE'S GATE prophesied it
would cost £100,000,000. Jeered at from
Ministerial side.
"LABBY," they said, "is more than
usually farcical."
Rather a costly farce. As a taxpayer,
would be glad to contract myself out of
future liabilities by payment on basis
of my share of the round one hundred
million.
However, a silver lining to every cloud.
AKERS DOUGLAS sewed it on to-night. Sup-
plementary Estimates under discussion.
Total amount not big as figures go in
these piping times. Only there is per-
sistent rise in the coal bill. In all public
offices this item gone up. Irish Members
particularly interested in case; whenever
fresh public office reached in course of
estimates, be sure you would find head of
Irish Member projecting from coal-hole
wanting to know why coal bill so large.
Dealing with vote for Houses of Parlia-
ment, AKERS DOUGLAS explained mystery.
True, the bill increased by some thou-
sands; extra cost only apparent. "What
has really happened is reduction of ex-
penditure. Coal bought now for Parlia-
ment and public offices on entirely new
principle; middleman abolished; First

ran away from his proposal to make

A good draw-forward we thought the
horse;
In imagining this we were wrong, of
course.
It is clear to-morrow is yesterday,
And everything travels the opposite way.
AN AIRY TRIFLE.
(From the "Times " of April 1, 1910.)
THE public enquiry in connection with
the claim of the Atmospheric Company,
for an increase of its powers, was re-
sumed yesterday, when Mr. BlNKS,- the
Company's Chairman, was further cross-
examined by Mr. Punch, K.C., who ap-
peared on behalf of the British Public.
In reply to counsel's questions, witness:
said that the present charge for the use
of air—a shilling in the pound on the
actual rental of a house—did not appear
too high. In fact, it was absolutely ne-
cessary to raise it, if his Directors'
salaries of £5,000 apiece were to be
maintained. He knew that some people
argued that the Company had no pro-
prietary rights over the atmosphere.
This was a mistake. If it was recognised
that water was a valuable commodity, to
be doled out sparingly by companies, and
paid for at fancy prices, the same prin-
ciple applied to air. The work of the
Company consisted in a variety of opera-
tions, requiring the most elaborate care.
Pressed as to the meaning of this, wit-
ness alluded to the annual banquet of
the Board, the preparation of which
caused the whole staff much anxiety.
No doubt, some complaints had been
made as to the limited amount of air
per head allowed by his Company. This
was really the fault of the consumers,
many of whom were extremely waste-
ful. Steps were being taken to remedy
this. For the future, anyone guilty of
having more than one window open,
except between the hours of two and
four p.m., would be summonsed. And
an extra rate would be levied on those
who had any ventilating apparatus in
their houses, on the same principle as
that employed by the water companies in
regard to bath-rooms. The additional
powers asked for by the Company were
inconsiderable—merely the right to add
a few more shillings in the pound on the
air-rate, together with an increased
period of imprisonment for those convicted
of infringing the Company's regulations.
Asked how he could have the impudence
to make such claims, the witness replied,
amid some laughter, that surely a public
which consented to endure the tyranny
of the water companies would submit to
anything a body of self - constituted
monopolists chose to ask. Indeed, he
considered that his Company was a greater
public benefactor than the water-company.
Some persons managed to get along with
very little water, but everyone needed
air. Therefore it was only right that
everyone should pay for it. Questioned
as to the conduct of the Company's officials,
witness admitted that complaints had been
made. It was possible that an inspector
had called at one house nine times in a
week, to test the consumption of air

therein. That, witness considered, showed
praiseworthy zeal. And the inspectors
•were paid (out of the rates) at so much
per visit.
At this point the atmosphere in the hall
became unbearable. The .-witness was
understood to gasp that his Company must
have cut off the air by mistake, and the
enquiry was hurriedly adjourned.

COMPENSATION.
LEARNED in natural laws the Government,
The County Councillor no less a student;
Each to one clause official ear has lent,
The compensative law, so just and prudent.
Each recks that for a heaven-climbing
hill
Some scooped-out valley lies below the
plain;
That every town grown peopleless and
still
Marks distant cities growing up amain.
Each has revolved in hydra-headed mind
How Nature when upheaping mound on
mound,
Occasionally aided by mankind,
Is elsewhere mole-like working under-
. ground.
Each for the other serving as a prop,
Of Nature's compensative wish aware,
When County Councillor pulls down a shop
The Government digs up a thoroughfare.
HOW TO PAY FOR THE WAR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I see hundreds of
suggestions in your contemporaries as to
the finding of means whereby to pay the
expenses of the war. Some advocate
special postage stamps, others taxes on
cats, others again on bicycles, and others
on, perambulators or cigarettes. Permit
me, Sir, as an old economist, to suggest a
practical way by which the Revenue is
bound to be largely increased and that is,

to fine every individual over twenty who
does not take at least half-a-pint of spirits
or a quart of ale every day. If your
conscientious teetotaller won't take strong
liquor, then he pays the penalty; if he
does, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
benefits. This is a double - barrelled
method well worthy of the attention of
Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH, because there 's
no getting away from the results. It's
heads I win, tails yon lose.—Your obe-
dient Servant, THOMAS TOPER.

Dweller among the top notes, firm and true,
Queen of the tender trill, the subtle shake.

Lively and gay, her spirit never flags;

Will help the low comedian with his "gags."

Of the most tuneful numbers in the score.

in Sonjrs. Time was, when quite the proper thing to do
WHS to relate in verse a touching tale,
Xot wholly unconnected with the Zoo.
But we have wearied of such songs as these;
This sort of thing perhaps may better please :—
MARY AND HER DAIRY.
The Poet MARY MILES was a country maid,
parodicth. Plumpish and plain and pleasant;.
Though some folks thought she was just a shade
Too cute for a simple peasant.
She lived at a dairy all serene,
And didn't she keep that dairy clean 1
For day after day, with smiling face,
She tucked up her sleeves and mopped the place.
MARY, MARY, mopped up a dairy,
Kept it clean and coolish and airy;
Many a passing stranger stopped
At the delicate dairy MARY mopped 1

Now simple MARY had got a most
Remarkable lot of swell beans;
Though not good-looking, yet she could boast
A beautiful pair of elbows.
And neighbouring noblemen saw the charms
Of MARY'S plump though plebeian arms;
So Dukes and Marquises thronged the door
While MARY mopped up the dairy floor.
MARY, MARY, mopped up a dairy,
Kept it clean and coolish and airy;
Many a high-born head was popped
In the delicate dairy MARY mopped!
At length a widowed but wealthy earl
Could really resist no longer;
For ev'ry day that he saw the girl
He felt that his love grew stronger.
He offered his heart and his coronet,
And fell on bis knees, though the floor was wet;
While MARY danced on the pots and pans,
And soon the vicar announced the banns.
MARY, MARY, quitted the dairy,
Work for her is unnecessary;
Never the slightest hint is dropped
Of the delicate dairy MARY mopped!
The above number, if set to a taking melody with a refrain
accompanied by a lilting movement on the part of singer and
girl-chorus, and immediately followed by a descriptive " dance
and exit," will no doubt become a great favourite with
the public. Its moral may be vague, but this will be more
than atoned for by the pleasing jingle of words in the refrain.
If the accompainment be fairly easy to play on the piano, the
song will become very popular with young men of the under-
graduate type, while suburban drawing-rooms will resound
with it before the piece has been running for a hundred nights.
There may be other lady stars, no doubt,
This is an average collection, though;
And quite enough, as you would soon find out
If you should ever try to run the show.
Three leading ladies—and each lady wills
That her name shall come first upon the bills.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A New English Dictionary (HENRY FROWDE) is getting on.
Volume IV., a massive tome, dealing with the letters F anil G,
is just issued. The scale upon which the work is accomplished
appears from the fact that, whilst Dr. JOHNSON dealt with only
1312 words beginning with G, Mr. HENRY BRADLEY and his
assistants explain and lavishly illustrate 15,542. This is twice
as many as are comprised within the borders of more massive
modern dictionaries. Among much curious information conveyed
is the fact that the letter F contains no words beginning with
a Latin prefix. (This will probably throw a new, strange light
upon the fact that the little old woman in Little Dorrit had no
name but "Mr. F.'s Aunt.") Words directly taken from the
Greek are also absent. Apart from its uses as the supremest
dictionary of the English Ian-
gnage, the book is positively
fascinating. My Baronite, a
busy man who could do very
well with forty-eight hours in
a day, shrinks from turning to
the treasure-trove in search of
varied meanings of a word,
knowing by experience that
having once opened the pages
he goes on reading when he
ought to be writing.
How startling in colour, at
least, if not in design, is the
cover wherein it has pleased
Publisher PEARSON (Limited)
that MJ-. RICHARD MARSH'S
Strange Wooing of Mary Bouv
ley shall appear before the
world of romance - readers!
Seeing the cover, the not over
fastidious novel devourer, in
search of a sensation, would
shudder and avoid. The
orangey-yellow would so im-
press itself on the retina that
for some seconds everything
must appear to his jaundiced
eye as smeared with this book-
paint. Was it "ever thus since
childhood's hour"? the Baron
asks in a Swivellerian mood,
recalling a "snatch," and re-
membering how once upon a
time, in 1891, as he has been
informed, this same Strange
Wooing appeared as a PEARSON
publication, price sixpence?
Soit: The Baron never saw it: to him it is as new as
though it had only just made its first appearance. Well,
it is a rough - and - ready sort of story, the satisfactory
perusal of which can be accomplished only by the most artful
skipper who knows when to come upon the tit-bits and when
to pounce. When the situation, to which minor incidents have
not inartistically prepared the way, arrives, it is a good one,
but the author tries to get more out of it than it will stand.
MR. MARSH does not take himself seriously, and treats his
melodramatic story in a light-hearted fashion that robs it of
all genuine realism. Yet it has its merits, and on those merits
it may be recommended to the hesitating.
An excellent plot underlies Mr. FRANKFORT MOORE'S last
novel, According to Plato (HcrCHiNSON). A man falsely accused
of forgery, knowing that the criminal is his friend, dumbly
suffers the penalty. On the termination of his imprisonment
he went out to Australia, and made enough money to leave

his son wealthy. The son returns to England and, not know-
ing the name of the man who victimised his father, is thrown
within the circle of his acquaintance, and, of course, falls in
love with his daughter. Mr. MOORK has, perhaps, not made
quite as much of this complexity as some would have done.
Led away by desire to give friendly digs at various fashion-
able follies, he invents elaborate and far-fetched machinery.
This makes possible some amusing sketches of a Technical
School of Literature and of a system of ingenious advertising.
The best character in a sprightly book my Baronite recog-
nises in Sir Creighton Severn, the great inventor, who success-
fully applied electricity alike to big ends and little ones.
Street Dust, by "OuiDA," is a collection of stories (F. V.
WHITE & Co.) of which the first gives its title to the book.
Not a happy title; nor is there much happiness in the stories
which might have been called
Four Dismal Nights and a Bright
Morning, or Da?-fc Cloud* and*
Bay of Sunlight. They are all
artistically told. The Little
Thief is sweet but painful.
The Fig Tree is terrible, being
the short history of a word, a
blow, a cut, and a run. But
the last story is cheerful,
bright, and as delightfully im-
probable as a fairy tale while
as pretty as the legend of
DICK WHITTINGTON. There 's
a cat in it, too; but she is "a
person of no importance," at
least of very secondary impor-
tance in comparison with the
chief characters. As we are
told to be thankful for small
mercies, so we may be grate-
ful for short stories, espe-
cially when they are written
by " OriDA" at her best.
Mr. JOHN LANE, who, pub-

For ourselves, if there be anything in names, we should say
that "Head-fort" indicated a strong-willed person who would
plunge into matrimony, head first, determinedly. As for the
jocosely verbal chances offered by the name of "BOOTE," are

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVABI.
PREPARING FOR THE PRESS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—A "school for
journalists" was tried, I believe, a few
years since. But would it not be better
to attempt something: of the kind with
the rising generation in the days of their
boyhood? I subjoin an interview as it
could be reproduced in any latter-dny
school newspaper.
(From oiir own Commissioner.)
Having carefully disguised
myself in a bald wig and a false
moustache (reserved for the
purpose from the accessories
supplied for our latest private
theatricals), I presented myself
to Mr. BIRCH. The impression
I wished to convey was that I
was a parent anxious to place
several sons under his care,
and from the manner in which
I was received I believe my
effort was successful.
"You keep a good table?"
I asked.
"An excellent one. As a
matter of fact, we frequently
have soup, flsh, and an excel-
lent joint or entree. Sweets,
of course, daily."
"Then, if NOBBY Minor de-
clares that 'resurrection pie'
twice a week is the only dinner
dish ho is guilty of a false-
hood?"
Mr. BIRCH raised his eyes
with an expression of astonish-
ment.
"And 1 should like to ask,"
I continued, pleased with the
effect I had created, "if you
are careful that your charges
shall not be over-worked."
"Certainly, my dear sir, cer-
tainly. Our object is to prepare
our pupils for the Universities,
and we have a distinguished j DEVOURED HIM.
list of successes."
postage stamps (even with a liberal dis-
count) in lieu of cash. So it is impor-
tant that the boys should receive what
is sent for them."
"Sir!" replied Mr. BIRCH, flushing
with anger. "You would imply that I
might cheat either the parents or their
children!"
"No, no," I explained hurriedly, for
when Mr. BIRCH gets into a wax he is
distinctly dangerous. "I don't mean to

G. P. O"-GRE!
"I presume," suid I, with a
smile, "that you refer to BRAINS
Major — who, I fancy, was
known to his schoolmates as
'Old Sweater,' and is frequently trotted
out as an example at prize distributions."
"Certainly, Mr. BRAINS had an excep-
tionally distinguished career at Oxford,
but I am unaware that he was ever known
as 'Old Sweater." Perhaps you received
tluit information also from NOBBY Minor."
I smiled and waved my hand gracefully.
I owed NOBBY Minor one-and-sixpence,
and he is for ever reminding me of that
unpleasant fact. I pursued my inquiries.
"Now, before I place any of my sons
with you, I should like to know that you
are liberal as to pocket-money. I am
given to understand that food at the
tuck-shop is very expensive, and that
there is a growing disinclination to accept

tolls me that he pays you at the rate of
eighteenpence a week, when I only re-

"Your pater!" exclaimed Mr. BIRCH,
springing to his feet; "and the money
you received!"
To add to the embarrassment of the
moment, at this point of the interview my
false moustache came off and 1 had to run
for my life.
As I hear you are on the point of being
expelled, I forward this contribution—
from a safe distance. May it be satis-

QUESTION AND ANSWER.
YOUR question, my pet, as I take it
Is solely and easily this—
If a burglar his pleasure should make
it
To trouble my somnolent bliss,
Should I use a revolver (and miss)
Or against his skull hurl boots to break
it?
I bow to your kind superstition
That "nunky" is splendidly
brave,
And would in this awkward
position
Infallibly go to his grave
In a noble endeavour to save
Much personal loss and con-
trition.
To prevent his abstracting ray
treasure,
His blood I might take on my
soul
With quite undeniable pleasure
If behind him in secret I
stole,
Myself pretty safe on the
whole,
And could shoot him or club
him at leisure.
But, child, as the truth of the
matter
I feel to a child must be told,
Your fondest illusions [shatter,
Your Uncle is gouty and old;
He never was any too bold—
Of late he's more timid, and—
fatter.
The truth is as follows: the

Would cover my diQIdent

All shreds of foolhardiness

If my life I .could save by an
ace,

As blithe as I am at a wed-
ding.

(Omnibus hoc vitium raconteuribiw!)
MY dear old Proser, I declare,
I like to hear you " in your glory,"
With many a halt from stair to stair,
As slowly we to bed repair,
With what rich gusto do you air
That " splendid story "!
"Splendid," I quite agree, although
I merely grunt like some John Dory;
I can't enthusiastic grow,
Because, to fact, some hours ago
I told it you myself, you know—
That splendid story!

CHAPTER IX.
Of Mr. Swtees, Uis Life and Works—The Dictionary of National
Biography—The Value of Observation.
WRITING a few weeks back on the subject of Mr. SURTEES,
the creator of Jorrocks, I committed myself to the statement
that but little was known of him except that he had lived and
written and was now departed.
A correspondent, however, has written to me from the neigh-
bourhood of Darlington as follows :—
"You may be interested to know that the author of Jorrocks is perfectly
well known. He lived in the County of Durham. The hounds he hunted
with were "The Braes o' Derwent," of which Pioo was huntsman. Mr.
SUBTEES belonged to a branch of the fine old county family of SVBTBES still
with us. I have just been sitting with my old friend, Mr. A—— M ,
aged eighty-six, late M. F. H., who says he knew him personally very well.
Many of the scenes of Mr. Jorrocki's adventures were in this neighbourhood,
and many of the persons described by Mr. SUBTEES were, or are still,
easily recognisable."
Hereupon, I did what I ought to have done before I wrote of
Mr. SURTEES at all. I turned to the Dictionary of National
Biography and looked up the name. There, sure enough, set out
in nearly three columns of that absolutely invaluable book, I
found plenty of details with regard to the novelist. He was
born in 1803, educated at Durham Grammar School, qualified as
solicitor, and began writing for the old Sporting Magazine.
During 1830 he compiled a manual for horse-buyers, and in 1831
helped to start the .Veto Sporting Magazine, which he edited
for five years. In the pages of this periodical he developed
the character of Mr. Jorrocks, "a sporting grocer, the quint-
essence of Cockney vulgarity, good humour, absurdity and
cunning." The Dictionary of N. B. further states that
it was the success of these sketches that led to the conception
of a similar scheme by CHAPMAN and SEYMOUR, which resulted
in the "Pickwick Papers." Later on SURTEES became a J.P.
for Durham, a major of militia and, glory of glories, high
sheriff of the County in 1856. He diecj in 1803. He was, says
the Dictionary, "a keen observer, very tall, bait a good
horseman, who, 'without ever riding for effect, saw a deal of
what the hounds were doing.'" For all further details, those
who are interested may be referred to the Dictionary itself,
which is a nice, handy little work in sixty-three volumes,
admirably suited to the waistcoat pocket. Having thus iii.ide
my reparation to the injured .shade of Mr. SriiTEKs, 1 may
proceed with a clear conscience.
For purposes of conversational excellence, I know nothing
that will serve a youth so well as a careful observation of the
types he meets when engaged in the chase of the fox. I put
aside for the moment the so-called fashionable packs. We
cannot all hunt in the Midlands; some of us have to be content
with the hounds that hunt the country in which we were born,
or where we have our residence, in the south, the north, the
east or the west. These, the average, steady-going packs, are,
in a sense, the backbone of the sport. They pursue it, year in,
year out, against all manner of adverse circumstances, and
keep the sacred lamp of the chase burning with an enthusiasm
that nothing can daunt. One who hunts with such a pack, not
for show, but for sheer love of the sport, may say of himself,
varying what GOLDSMITH said of Sir JOSHUA RKYNOLDS :—
When they talked of their Quorna and their Pytchleys and stuff
He shifted his trumpet and only took snuff.
And devotees of the Quorn and the Pytchley may be appeased
when they reflect that in this perversion they are privileged in
regard to hunting with the position that RAPHAEL and CORREQGIO
hold in regard to painting. So the matter is fair all round.
I will suppose, then, that you hunt where you live, and that
you live where most Englishmen, after all, live—that is, in a part
of England unadorned by a fashionable pack. Keep your eyes

POST OFFICE COMPETITION.
["The Post office threatens to supersede the
District Messenger Boys."]
BRISK boys, who go so very fast,
So quickly yet so surely too,
Hero is an awful threat at last,
Which might dishearten even you;
Henceforth the fatal fact you know,
You struggle with the O. P. O.
However quickly you may run,
However promptly do your task,
Remember there is always one
From whom no mercy you can ask;
A monster, deaf and blind and slow,
Will dog your steps—the G. P. O.
Yet be not frightened or ashamed,
But bravely to your duties keep,
The horrid monster I have named
Is usually fast asleep;
And, should it now less drowsy grow,
You need not fear the G. P. O.
Yoit "ve heard the fable of the Hare,
Who, while the Tortoise won the race,
Was idly dozing. Now the pair
Of you, in such a tale, change place;
The Tortoise certainly would go
To sleep, since he 's the G. P. O.
TO CHLOE.
CHLOE, when (to save expense)
Years ago I lived at Brixton,
While for your proud residence
Kensington your father fixed on;
Then, though living far apart
(1 with heart with rapture beating,
You with blush and well-feigned start),
Somehow wo were always meeting.
But though wo now, CHLOE dear
(How is it? Alas! I wonder),
To each other live so near,
We are as the poles asunder.
Where you go to sup or dine
I am not allowed to follow;
At that dismal club of mine
Doomed my lonely meal to swallow.
Strange indeed, that I, who then
Danced attendance, fetched and
I, alone, of all the men, [carried,
Scarcely see you—now wo 're married.
GIVE AND TAKE.

GIVE a man a dish ho can eat,
Give a man a wine he can drink;
If they 're bad for his health he Ml get

And never will sleep a wink.
Tell a man a stupid old joke,
Give a man a book dull to read;
You '11 be on the floor and out of the
door
With a nose ho has caused to bleed.
Give a man a note he can change
While you wait his return to tea;
Your trust is in vain,—but I needn't

'Tis " the confidence trick," you sec.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BELLES LETTRES.
BY BABOO JABBEBJEE.
I.—An Englishwoman's Love-Letters.
I AM to commence -with the personal explanation. After my
star was in the brilliant ascendant of a crack British Novelist,
owing to successful serial publication of "The Adventures of
Mr. BINDABUN BHOSH" (which has, somehow, not vet made its
appearance in voluminous form), I was humbly approached with
a complimentary request from Horible Punch, that I was to do
him some criticisms on up-to-date English fictions and litera-
tures.
But, finding myself destitute of the quantum suff of straw
to compose even the moiety of a brick, I nilled the invitation
with a polite nolo episcopari. Subsequently, however, I made
the discovery that literary circles, both in Calcutta and
London, were in the pucker of a stew concerning a certain
volume of post-obit correspondence, entitled, An Englishwoman's
Love-Letters.
Some stoutly upheld them as the unadulterated <mtput of a
genuine young deceased feminine; others more sceptically
maintained that they were the spurious and flim-flam produc-
tions of some anonymous male.
Not having perused the said documents at the time, I was
obliged to confess myself totally incompetent to undo the
Gordian knot of their authenticity; but, hey-day! presently
Rumour, protruding her thousand tongues painted with venom,
indicated my inoffensive self as either the stony-hearted re-
cipient or the /OTIS et origo of these elegant billet-dotixs!
So, impelled by sheer curiosity, I procured a copy of the
volume from a Calcutta library, and read same with eyes
jutting out in amazement. I should mention that I had pre-
viously seen copious extracts in the pages of Punch's periodi-
cal ; but these, though obviously from the same hand, are pro-
bably taken from some enlarged edition, as I cannot find them
in my own copy.
First and foremost, let me vehemently deny that any of these
epistles were written either to or by myself, though I will
admit that, while a resident in England, I received countless
equally impassioned notes, and not only from Miss MANKLETOW,
but innumerable other members of the softer sex.
Had I been an (Edipus to foresee the frantic avidity with
which cultivated British readers would devour authentic love-
letters which were not even addressed to themselves, I should
have preserved those chaste and erotical effusions, instead of
carelessly destroying matter worth many hundreds of rupees.
As to the wanton and gratuitous'accusation that I wrote the
contents of this volume, while I will not affect such false
modesty as to pretend inability to do so (and in far more correct
style and composition), still I can conscientiously assure all
honble readers that I am, like Emperor CESAR'S better half,
above suspicion.
And I should really have expected that their own nude
commonsense would have demonstrated the utter folly and
preposteronsness of such a supposition!
Is it reasonably plausible that any certificated B.A. could
perpetrate such a solecism as "Look, see! O blind mouth!"
[v. Letter I.] when it is within the knowledge of the veriest
schoolboy that the mouth is not the organ of vision? Or am I
so mediocre an astronomer that I should talk of a star swim-
ming up, clasping the writer, and showing her the portrait of a
lover? [v. Letter II.] This is not customary with any stars
that I am acquainted with, and if it is contended that all this
is intended metaphorically, no Oriental scholar is addicted to
mix his metaphors in such topsy-turvy fashions.
On the other side, I am constrained to admit that there are
certain passages which, to a superficial student, might seem to
implicate myself. Letter XII. contains an allusion to "a well-
dressed sort of young fellow, in grey and a moustache, and know-
ing how to ride," which, except in the matter of proficiency "in
the art of equitation, is on all fours with my own personal
appearance.
In Letter IV. the writer inquires if her beloved goes out
rabbit-shooting for love of her, and misses every time, and in
Letter L. she requests him not to shoot any lark birds, it being
incontrovertible that, when engaged in pleasures of the Chase,
I did miss nearly every time, and did not hit a single lark bird.
Also, in Letter C, she addresses him as "Dear Prince Wonder-
ful," and I was notoriously mistaken by most London feminines
for some sort of Native Prince. Again, in Letter Q, she
narrates that she hoard someone speak of him as "charming,"
which she might constantly have heard remarked of this un-
worthy self had she been a resident at the same select board-
ing establishment, though I do not assert she was, assuming
her to be of feminine gender at all.
Moreover, she comments [Letter XXXI.] on the resemblance
between a portrait by Honble TITIAN of a certain tip-top
Norfolk magnate and "somebody she likes," and, though un-
acquainted with either of the parties, I have frequently
received compliments on my aristocratic bearings, and have
been actually accosted in the streets as the "blooming Duke."
And, finally, there is the striking reference [Letter LV.] to her
pen as "a poor dinky" [qu. clerical mistake for "dingy," or
"inky"] "little Othello," which appears to contain a round-
about reference to some Native gentleman with rather jealous
proclivities. Still, after making all these handsome admissions,
I repeat that the cap is a palpable misfit for such an unassuming
head as the present writer's.
I will next examine the question: Are these documents the
work of a genuine female woman or vice versa?
If not, one thing is a cock-certainty. They are by a male
who is an au fait in the knowledge of the proper attitude of a
female towards her lord and master. The writer addresses her
most Beloved as " her own sweetheart whom she so worships ";
[Letter VI.] invites him [Letter XIII.] to come and see her, but
to shut "those dear cupboards of vision," his eyes; (probably
in dread of being dazzled) asks permission [Letter XXI.] to send
his poor foot a kiss per post; tells him [Letter XXIV.] that
"her love lies grovelling and insufficient at his feet, and will,
till they "become amputated;" begs him [Letter LVI.] to continue
to smudge his letters with a "whirlpool mark of his thumb," for
the reason that it is "delicious to rest her face (on the said
smudge) and feel him there."
All this is marvellously true to nature and characteristic of
the feminine temperaments, as I can testify from having been
frequently compelled to correct similar tendencies in my own
wives.
But there are other points which render me suspicious.
Would a real lady request that she might not be given presents
of jewellery? [v. Letter III.] I can only say this is utterly
opposed to my own experience of the sex. Would any feminine
muster up sufficient physical courageousness to tie up a mouse
in a paper bag and throw it out of the window? I should
consider this a dare-devil proceeding, even for myself. Or
would not a genuine English lady use some more refined
expression than to write about "waters walloping under the
bellies of gondolas?" [Letter XXXVIII.]
Without presuming to decide where even angels will rush in
and disagree, I proceed to another point, videlicet: Why did
these lovers part? And here I have no hesitation in solving so
facile a conundrum. They parted because the lady was a
victim of woolgathering wits, and the sweet bells of brain were
irrevocably jangled.
This I can prove by internal evidence: In Letter IV. she
says she is making her dress-tail purposely long so that, before
vanishing round a corner, it may say to him: "I love you so,
see how slowly I am going." She entreats him [Letter XXXI, j
to walk only on one leg when thinking of her. She suffers from
delusions (1) that the constellation of Ursa Major looks in at

her -window and growls at her. [Letter V.] (2) that a man came
down from a Blue-moon and partook of plum-porridge in her
society [Letter P.]
I inquire fearlessly, are these the concomitants of an un-
clouded intellect? And I «xpect with utmost confidence that
Echo will oblige with the customary answer in the negative.
My theory is, then, that the young man broke it off on
ground that his fiancee was secreting a bee in her bonnet, and
that he abstained, with the delicacy of a chivalrous, from
telling her this reason, and also from endangering his person
by a personal interview.
It may be asked: why did she not adopt the ordinary Con-
stitutional remedy of deserted feminines, and institute legal
proceedings for breach of promise to marry, as Miss M. 'did
against my unfortunate self? She had, prima facie, a better
case; he had a superfluity of the root of evil; she had pre-
served all his letters; and he had publicly acknowledged her
at a ball as his official fiancee, [v. Letter XI.]
The reason is plain as a pike's head. No solicitor, however
full of push, would undertake the cause of a client afflicted
with the loose tile, and giddy as a goose with rats in her
upper story!
But in making these shrewd guesses, I must again disown
all personal connection with this painful kettle of flsh.. It
would do me severe social and professional damages were I
supposed to be the hero, or even the author, of this notorious
production, and I cannot too emphatically contradict 'such
fallacious and cock-and-bull assertions.
Nevertheless, as I do not wish to damp a juvenile litterateur
(if not deceased), I have pleasure in testifying that I have
perused the little volume with considerable interest.
Calcutta, Feb. llth, 1901. H. B. J.
A MEETING OF THE BENCH.
[" It was extremely necessary that the judges themselves should know
something of the meaning and effect of the sentences they passed, and it
should be every judge's, duty to acquaint himself, as far as possible, with the
effects of different punishments."—Tht Lord Chief Jtwtice, at the meeting of
the Society of Comparative Legislation.'FeSrudr'y'21.]
The L—d C—r. In criminal matters, my learned brethren, I
must confess I have always been a mere child. My interest in
crime and punishment is, of course, merely an academic one.
Therefore, I have much pleasure in calling upon my friend the
Lord Chief Justice to open this discussion.
The L. C. J. (genially). Well,.dear boys—or—that is,'my noble,
learned and distinguished brethren, I want to talk to you about
my recent speech on the subject of making the punishment fit
the crime. I regret the absence, to-day, of Mr. Justice
GILBKRT, whom I may perhaps describe as—ahem—the pioneer
in this untrodden by-way of criminal jurisprudence (Fine phrase
that, H-ISB-Y. Hope the reporters will get it all right). The
whole thing lies in a nutshell. How much of what sort of
punishment will most effectually prevent any given crime? A
mere matter of proportion, which we can only settle by a course
of personal investigation, in which I hope a number of judges
will be ready to take part. In the first place, we will assume
that my Brother D-Y has been guilty of a series of acts of
violence, felonies, in fact, of varying flagrancy, and we will
therefore sentence him in the straightforward, if unfeeling,
language of Stephen's Digest to be "once, twice, or thrice,
privately whipped " in addition to the usual terms of imprison-
ment. After each whipping he will report on the effects, and
we shall thereby gradually arrive at a correct sliding scale of
strokes and crimes, so that in future a judge will merely have
to refer to the scale in order to give a criminal the correct
number of strokes sufficient to prevent him from repeating the
particular crime. And so with all our other punishments.
Various judges will kindly oblige with sliding scales compiled
from knowledge acquired at first hand.
(Sings—Con amore.)
Our object all sublime
We shall achieve in time
To make the punishment fit each crime
That is by us cognoscible!
So judges shall be sent
To achieve this high intent
By per-so-nal ex-per-i-ment—
At least, "as far as possible "!

But only as far as possible!
The L—d C—r. Very good idea. What about capital punish-
ment, though?
37ie £>. C. J. Capital punishment, my lord, does not seem to
me to be divisible or capable of being adjusted according to a
sliding scale, unless your lordship would care to experiment
personally in the effects of partial electrocution?
D—g, J. (interrupting). Never mind Capital; let us get on to
Labour—hard labour. [Laughter.

we have, and are likely to have, no unseemly levity in Appeal
Court II.
The L. C. J. No; have to go to the House of Commons for
that, eh, old boy? Do you remember how
The L—d C—r. Keally, my lord, I think we are wandering
somewhat from the point.
The L. C. J. As your lordship pleases. With regard to hard
labour
D—y J. (in a solemn voice). I have a suggestion to submit.
There is one form of hard labour which can best be performed
by one who possesses the trained action of an expert pedestrian.
I suggest that the learned lord's early athletic training, with
which we are all so familiar, makes him peculiarly fitted to
prepare a sliding scale showing the daily amount of treadmill
proportionate to every offence known to the law. A course,
say, of two or three years' duration, not exceeding four hours a
day, in spells of
Jt—h, J. If I might venture for one moment to interpose,
though merely an Equity Judge, and therefore unversed in
crime, still, as an old Fellow of a well-known Oxford College,
and a regular Saturday visitor to the Links at Sandwich, it
occurs to me that all this experimenting in punishments which
my Common Law brethren so nobly propose to undertake, might
be saved by the simple expedient of constituting a Crimiua
Court of Appeal. In Civil matters, and especially, if I may
say so, in Chancery matters, we find a similar institution ol
much value in correcting any slips, or ineleganticc juris (if I
may be permitted the Latin expression), which may inadver-
tently occur in the Courts of first instance. I cannot help
thinking, that in order to make the punishment effectually fit
the crime, a strong court of criminal appeal

sympathy with the well-known hymn, commencing, "Pleasant
are the courts above." (Cries of "Order!") All I want

MY DEAR JACK,—I want you to come

as you can help her with a children's
party, and also play Pantaloon in a little
thing being got up by the young people.
I will mount you on the Tuesday with our
Staghounds, as I know you are fond of a
day's hunting. No, don't thank me, my
dear chap—I shall be only too glad if you
will go, as the horse I am intending to
put you on is a rank brute, and when he
doesn't refuse his fences—which is a rare
occurrence—he invariably falls into them.
However, you won't mind that, will you?
You will have to put up with real
bachelor accommodation I am afraid, as
the house is crammed. The best I can do
for you is a half share of one of the attics.
Our cook has left us, all unexpectedly, so
this places her room at our disposal for
two of you. The kitchen-maid is doing
her best to keep us from starving; but,
though she means well, I can hardly class
her as a cordon bleu.
LOUISE DEARLOVK, that pretty little
girl you were so sweet upon last season,
is unable to come; but her brother—the
red-headed youth who was always trying
to pick a quarrel with you—will be here.
I am so short »f horses that I fear I
must ask you to cab the 'four miles up
from the station; but I am sure you won't
mind taking the rough with the smooth.

tion, I ask which is " the smooth "?

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"' THE Right Honble. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, M.P., who made
possible the Unionist Parliament of 1895 to 1900." should bo
bo considerably gratified by having so useful, so amusing,
and so historically accurate a work dedicated to him as
Mr. H. W. LUCY'S Diary of a Unionist Parliament (J. W.
ARROWSMITH). It is excellent in style and sound in matter,
while as a work of reference, as to details that would have
escaped the 7iotiee of the ordinary stolid chronicler, it is
invaluable. But Mr. LUCY is ever on the alert; nothing worth
recording escapes his eagle eye: he comes, he sees, he pounces.
The major and minor notables in Parliament, with their "tricks
and their manners," are all placed before the reader in a
series of "living pictures," varied in combination and dis-
tinct in character. Occasionally, the REED (E. T.) is called
in to assist the Pen, and his quaintly grotesque sketches,
speaking likenesses as they are in broadest caricature, add
point and brilliancy to the scenes described. Those " in the
know" will welcome this book as a pleasant reminder, and
the majority in "the-don't-know" will be delighted to find
that Parliamentary Proceedings can be so dealt with as to
interest them as much as an entertaining novel by their
favourite author, whoever he may be.
Five years ago Miss BROMLEY DAVENPORT wrote the Story of
Aline, a first novel my Baronite hastened to applaud as a
work of singular originality and power. Miss DAVENPORT,
now Lady RIDLEY, has not been in a hurry to make a second
attempt. The result justifies her prescience and her prudence.
Anne Mainwaring (LONGMAN'S) is a considerable advance on her
successful first effort. To begin with, the literary style is
excellent—not always the case when lovely woman stoops to
writing. All her people are of flesh and blood. One seems to
have met them somewhere. Lady RIDLEY certainly has. It is
a long time since my Baronite read a novel which had about it
such atmosphere of reality. An additional charm to the story
is its partial framework in the old manor-house, Waynstede,
with its ancient ruins, its park, its skies, its moor, and its ever-
changing greenery. Anne Maimvaring confirms the impression
conveyed by the Story of Aline, that the now century is
dowered with a new novelist ranged close by the limited
circle of first-class women writers. If need be, we will wait
another five years for a novel from Lady RIDLEY. But she
must go on.
When in a novel the experienced Baron lights on the phrase,
"A strange, hunted look came into her eyes," he pauses to
repeat SNEER'S question in The Critic, "Haven't I heard
that line before?" and prolongs the interval in order that
he may commune with himself as to it being worth his
while to devote any more time and attention to the story.
So it chanced, during his perusal of The ffin of Jasper
StaHdish (CONSTABLE), written by "RITA," that coming across
that " strange, hunted look," the Baron debated as to whether
he was sufficiently interested in the plot to see it out to the
end. And he decided that in spite of a considerable amount of
superflous Irish padding, and despite the motives for the crime
being inadequate, and in spite of murderer and victim being
not particularly interesting personalities, yet would he per-
severe in order to see if "RITA" had given a sudden twist to
her tale which would lift it out of the very ordinary class of
stories to which, up to a certain point, it seemed to belong.
There is a good love scene, out hunting, following, of course,
upon an accident that, for a while, brings together the estranged
lovers. But the dialogues are somewhat tedious, and the
narrative too slow for the reader who wants to "come to
Hecuba." Had the title been The Sins, instead of Tin- Sin, it
would have been more exact if not quite so striking, and had
"RITA " only devised that, somehow or other, an exceptionally
terrible vengeance should have fallen upon the sordid criminal,
the book would have received a stronger recommendation to
public attention than the Baron can, under the circumstances,
givo it.
Anyone at all "out of sorts" in this perverse weather, and
forced to remain indoors, will do well to adopt the Baron's
advice which is, that he take at certain times a dose of Dr.
ASHBY STERRY'S mixture entitled The Bystander (SANDS & Co.),
and read "Aimking," "A Bad Cold," and several others as
occasion may serve. But let the patient defer his study of
jnmi:-. Clmzzlewit, in same work, until he is quite well again and
strong enough to bear it. THE BARON DE B.-W.

And as yet on ne'er a nostrum could rely;

Failed me, so the one in question
May be but a case of " Wink the other eye!"
POTAGE A LA STRAND THEATRE.
THAT such a piece of farcical folly as In the Soup, representing
an initially good idea of a plot utterly frittered away in the
attempt to elaborate its dramatic development, should have
achieved a success that has carried it merrily over one hundred
and fifty nights, and that apparently it should still be going
strong, speaks volumes for the company of clever comedians
headed by Mr. JAMES WELCH and Miss CARRIE CRONYN, and
ably seconded by Miss MARIA SAKER, Mrs. RICHARD EDGAR,
Miss AUDREY FORD (one of the "spoons" in the soup),
Messrs. JOHN BEACCHAMP, HARRY FARMER (the other " spoon "),
VICTOR WIDDICOMBE, and WILLIAM WYES (looking inimitably
foolish), who play all together, in a rapid touch-and-go, give-
and-take fashion that artfully affords no pause for thought,
and evokes continuous merriment from the audience, who are
thoroughly with them— " in the soup "—from first to last.
What is In the Soup is not the strength of the essence of wit,
but is simply the flavouring and spice thrown into every possible
line by the actors, who also supply the brightly burning lamp
of animal spirits that keeps the rather weak material bubbling
hot, and thus it is rendered highly palatable to a mirthfully
disposed audience. Not since in November, 1899, Mr. THOMAS
WISE played Singleton Sites, in an amusing piece The Wrong
Mr. Wright, has there been such peals of laughter in this

IN RE ARMY REFORM.
(Suggestions that have reached 10, Bouverie
Street.)
Most flattering, certainly. Apparently,
when the Commander-in-Chief and the
Secretary of State for War cannot agree
upon any matter the affair is to be re-
ferred to me. Well, I am not quite sure
I have the requisite expert knowledge,
but, however, I shall be happy to do my
best. But am not quite sure that best
will be the best for the British Empire.
(Signed) THE MAN IN THE STREET.
It must be obvious that the first thing
necessary is to put the Volunteers, the
Militia, and the Regulars, on the same
footing—especially the Volunteers.
(Signed) A CITIZEN SOLDIER.
Only thing possible under the circum-
stances is to remove the class distinction
between Militia and Regular. The Volun-
teers are absolutely superfluous.
(Signed) OLD CONSTITUTIONAL Force.
Return to the old idea, of course. Let
the Regular Army be the Regular Army,
and abolish the Auxiliary Forces.
(Signed) GENERAL AGED SEVENTY.
Why not turn the British Army into a
Company of Limited Liability? Jokers
say it is already. But, to be serious—for
it is a very serious matter—a good pros-
pectus should be got out at once. Would
be pleased to join the Board after allot-
ment. (Signed) PROMOTER.
What is wanted is centralisation. Let
one man be responsible for everything. I
have a brother-in-law who would accept
the appointment on very reasonable terms.
(Signed) A PATRIOT.
Avoid centralisation, a system which has
been the curse of the Army. Things will
come right somehow, whatever is done.
But only carry out my idea and all will
be well, and at once.
(Signed) OPTIMIST.
Why have an Army at all? It is an
expensive luxury, and is absolutely
needless if proper diplomacy is used to
settle international disputes.
(Signed) A PRACTICAL MAN.
If we are to have an Army, let us have
the best army. If we are to have a
Commander-in-Chief, let him be the ablest
commander-in-chief. If we are to have a
War Minister, let him be the best war
minister. Surely this is the best policy.

It is irritating that so much should be
written about Army Reform, when the
only way of securing it is at hand. Let
Mr. Punch himself take the entire com-
mand of the Imperial Forces, and all will

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FEOM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M. P.
Bouse of Lords, Monday, March 4.—
When, thirty-five years ago, Mr. GLADSTONE
•was rejected by his Alma Mater, he
hastened down to Manchester and, as he
said, stood before the electors unmuzzled.
To-night Field-Marshal LOUD WOLSELEV,
quitting post of Commander-in-C'hief, faced
his Peers unmuzzled. House crowded to
listen to a bark that might prelude a bite.
WOLSELEY took up position on second
cross-bench •where Field-Marshals most
do congregate. On similar occasions in
times past the pleasant presence of the
PRINCE OF WALES has been on front bench,
DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE seated a little lower
down. To-night the bench tenantless.
H.R.H. is EDWARD THE SEVENTH. When
he comes down to House he sits on Throne.
Possibly subject matter of debate too
painful for DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE to listen
to. Howbeit, his place was empty.
On third cross-bench with accidental—
or was it studious ?—avoidance of being on
same line as his predecessor in the post of
Commander - in - Chief sat BOBS, grimly
attentive; saying nothing; doubtless
thinking a good deal.
WOLSELEY set ofl at a gallop; if he had
an appointment with ARABI PASHA at
Tel-el-Kebir at half-past one to-morrow
morning, couldn't have started at higher
speed. Kept it up throughout. When,
after rattling through an hour, he made
end of speaking noble Lords nearly
breathless from effort to keep pace. Con-
clusion exceedingly definite; system in
vogue since WOLSELEY went to Pall Mall
is "pernicious," fraught with peril to
the nation. Commander-in-Chief is a
nonentity; to-day ANTONIUS BRODERICK
personally commands British Army vice
CAESAR, LORD LANSDOWNE, gone to Foreign
Office. WOLSELEY schooled himself in re-
straint of passion or strong language.
But infinite scorn flashed under his quiet
manner as he pictured the civilian
Secretary of State planning fortifications
and directing armies whilst a veteran
soldier, used to 'arms from his youth,
fretted his soul in an overlooked ante-
chamber in Pall Mall.
For a civilian, LANSDOWNE uncom-
monly warlike; not content with de-
fending system attacked, carried war
into enemy's country; bluntly accused
WOLSF.LEY of sulking in his tent, jealous
of a system that placed Secretary of
State in direct touch with 7uilitary
experts. Shirked duties assigned to him;
neglected auxiliary forces at home; made
possible the occupation of Ladysinith;
failed to warn the Cabinet that it would
take more than one Army Corps to sub-
jugate the Boer.
Here was a pretty washing in public
of War Office dirty linen. Noble Lords
alarmed, dismayed, thought they had
better forthwith adjourn; moreover, the
sacred dinner hour was striking. So
they went home more than ever at ease
in contemplation of the British Army.
Business done. — Duel between late
Secretary of State for War and his
esteemed colleague, the ex-Commander-
in-Chief.
Tuesday night.—The MAUKISS in fine
ho asked, "which, so far as we can see, is
now raging between the rfijime of 1888
and the regime of 1893."
He saw it all. At the former epoch the
Adjutant-General, having a scheme to
\ submit, brought the papers in the first
instance to theCommander-in-Chief. After
\ issue of Order in Council in 1893, the
papers went first to Secretary of State.

A DIVISION"
{for u'tiii'h even the Ini-Moichatl Fl-v-n and Co. will quit tlie House).
"The mhost injhoyable noight oi iver spint! "—Mr. 3f-th-l J-s-ph Fl-c-n.
form to-night. Situation decidedly grave;
disclosure made that whilst armies in the
field in South Africa, sometimes half-
famished, often shelterless through the
night, were fighting for life and Empire,
Heads of Department in supreme control
of military affairs were squabbling on
details of personal supremacy. The hero
of many fights, victor of most, "our only
General," as he was wont to bo hailed,
publicly impeached by a colleague as
personally responsible for the two circum-
stances chiefly responsible for prolonga-
tion of the war, circumstances that at one
time threatened to realise Mr. KRITGEII'S
cheerful proposal to drive the English
into the sea.
"A lamentable, unseemly attack,"
ROSKBERY called it, in tones of burning
indignation.
The MAKKlSs, waking up, shaking off
the drowsiness born of partly audible
remarks from NORTHBROOK, CHELMSFORD
and DUNRAVEN, assumed mental attitude
of old Caspar seated in the sun, posed
by the inquisitive small boy. What
WOLSELEY and LAXSDOWNE fought each
other for the MARKISS never could make
out. "To me," ho said, looking from the
ex-Secretary of State to the retired Com-
mander-in-Chief, "it has all seemed very
strange." "Now what is the dispute?"
"That's all," said the light-hearted
Premier, looking round at amazed Lords,
who thought they had for two nights been
engaged in debate on a subject that goes
to the root of efficiency of Army, with
which is bound up the safety of the
Empire.
Business done.—In House of Commons
Irish Members, bored to death by debate
on Education vote, suddenly broke out.
PRINCE ARTHUR, after patiently watching
waste of a week in discussion of Supple-
mentary Estimates moved closure. House
cleared for Division. Irish Members
refused to retire; were at length after
desperate struggle'.! severally carried out
by the police. "God save Ireland!"
they sang as they were borne towards the
door; but, owing to circumstances, the
familiar carol was sadly out of tune. As
the MEMBER FOR SARK, summing up the
situation, says, "The Irish members took
the floor and the police took the Irish
members."
House of Commons, Thursday night.—No
one looking on this evening would con-
ceive it to be the same assembly that
burst into tumult at the midnight hour of
Tuesday, what time Mr. FLAVIN'S flowered
waistcoat was rent, and Mr. JEREMIAH
JORDAN had occasion to add a fresh chapter
to his Lamentations. Every seat filled;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
the long side galleries thronged ^ Peers
penned like sheep in gallery facing
SPEAKER'S chair; over all atmosphere of
intense expectancy, through which from
time to time flash electric sparks from
Irish quarter. Gunpowder thick sprinkled
over floor; needed but the dropping of
match from awkward hands, the spark of
steel on flint from elephantine boot, to
cause explosion.
Temporarily relieved from presence
of the Twelve Apostles of disorder,
ashamed of what had happened, deeply
concerned to re-establish itself in public
opinion. House assumed an attitude of
quiet dignity that forbade such mishap.
SPEAKER sounded key-note. JEREMIAH
JORDAN wrote protesting it was all a
mistake about his having disobeyed
instruction of Chairman, of Committee to
leave House when division was called.
To logical Saxou mind question suggests
itself. How could JEREMIAH have been
"conveyed," as the police call it, from his
seat bolow the gangway if, in obedience to
the injunctions of CHAIRMAN, he was at
the moment in the Division Lobby? J. J.
explains. He had meekly gone forth when
division was called, but hearing pre-
monition of a row in House had instinc-
tively returned; found a convenient post
of observation below gangway; was
named by CHAIRMAN, and before you
eould say JF.RKMIAH JORDAN found himself
haled forth by well-meaning but undis-
criminating police.
SPEAKER at once accepted this as estab-
1 tailing prima facie case for enquiry;
permitted JOHN DILLON to raise question
of Privilege upon it, resulting in full ac-
ceptance of JEREMIAH'S narrative and
removal of the. ban of suspension. To
this happy ending, Which had powerful
influence over character of debate on New
Standing Order, Chairman of Committees
contributed frank admission that, amid
turmoil of the midnight orgie, he made a
mistake with respect to the part JKKKMIAH
played in it.
Bn.tine.s3 done.—Debating New Standing
Order providing expulsion for remainder
of Session of Members guilty of ex-
treme disorderly conduct.
JiYida;/, 5.40 a.m.—House just up after
passing Standing Order. HUGH CECIL con-
tributed picturesque episode to prolonged
drama. Nearly two hundred years ago,
Ireland even then a distressful country,
Dean SWIFT contributed to settlement
of problem A Modest Propose/ for Pre-
venting the Children of Poor People in
Ireland from being a Burden to theii
Parents. Title of Pamphlet long; its
recommendation short. "Fatten and eat
them," wrote the genial Dean.
Lord HUGH has an equally short waj
with recalcitrant Irish Members. "Clap
'em in prison," says he. Moved Amend
ment to Cousin ARTHUR'S Resolution
leaving out clause about suspension for
>est of Session, substituting "and shall
>e committed to prison until the further
order of the House." Pretty to see the
willowy figure of Lord HUGH swaying
>efore the storm that burst upon him from
rish camp when he rose to move his
Amendment. The mobility sign rather
of strength than of weakness. When
irishmen howled themselves hoarse he
>egan in voice of womanly softness to
urge the reasonableness of his proposal.
Absolutely ignored existence of turbulent
crowd immediately facing him; only sign
of consciousness of the tumult was the
almost delirious movement of the long
;hin fingers of nervous hands. Never
since public speaking began were seen
such gestures, such mad movements of de-
irious digits. Otherwise calm, courteous,
sweetly-persuasive in effort to show that
:he discipline he recommended, possibly
drastic at first glance, would really
be conducive to what Mr. KRVGER would
call the moral and intellectual advance-
ment of the Irish Member.
'What an Inquisitor he would have
made'!" said SARK, looking admiringly
at the frail figure, the passionless face.
'' He was born four hundred years too late.''
Business done.— At to-night's sitting
House again crowded. St. JOHN BRODRICK,
in masterly speech, detailed proposals for
Army Reform..
TO A JILT.
MOST cruelly fair, I 'm returning
The presents you squandered on me,

Ah! sadly I sing it, discerning
That you would prefer to be free;
My ring you will doubtless surrender
(Two rubies enclosing a pearl,
Engraved with some lettering tender)
To serve for a kindlier girl.
You will find in my registered packet
The pin (of Assyrian gold),
The button you cut from your jacket,
The gloves (they are covered with
mould);
In fact, there is each little present
Save one, that I beg as a grace
And a memory bitterly pleasant—
Your handkerchief, dainty with lace.
And this—I would swear that my broken
Aud'moribund heart couldn't spare,
This infinitesimal token
Of our idiotic affair.
But truth, which is all that is left me,
Compels me the notion to quash,
Since Fate of the trifle bereft me—
It never came back from the wash!
PROVOCATION.
[" If the purpose of Great Britain is still to look
or delay she will not get it. If it be her deter-
mination to pick a quarrel with us she will find
. . -when the war terminates that the steel band
which binds the Throne in London to Australia and
ndia, which passes through Canada, Till hare been
ent ill twain, and with its severance down will
ro the British Empire."—Senator Morgan.]
OLD lion, feeble and effete,
None of your impudent resisting;
Tear up that treaty obsolete.
I guess your worn-out stump wants
twisting.
)o you imagine UN'CLE SAM
About your treaties, few or many,
ares, one and all, a single—cent?
Not much! he isn't having any.
So when our Eagle flaps about
If you but touch a single feather,
'. reckon he '11 just wipe you out.
You and your colonies together.
Yes, just you let the noble fowl
With beak and claw but once get to you,
The rooster soon will—What! you growl?
You want to pick a quarrel—do you?
THE SCIENTIST ON HIS METAL.
[" It was sufficiently startling to hear of arsenic
as a constituent of beer, but now Professor W. N.
ElARTLF.y, of the Royal College of Science, Dublin,

THE wonders of science who shall tell?
The penetrating glance of seer
Draws Truth from out her sunken well,
And traces arsenic in beer.
Still pressing on with probing eye,
The panting scientist puts foot
In Truth's domain, and learns thereby
That silver is contained in soot.
Not far the time when we shall learn
To look where we ne'er looked before
And iu least likely place discern
The secret of some precious ore.
To find within some dark recess
Of the constrained anatomy
Of any messenger express
Slight evidence of mercury.
To con the fact with marked relief,
Which truth no longer dare conceal,
That in the nature of the thief
There lies a tendency to steel.
To hear some scientist serene
Inform you with expanding grin,
That he from his grand-parent mean
Extracted had a heap of tin.
To hoar it said in serious tone,
Accepted, too, in spirit proper,
That the policeman has been known
By many to be merely — copper.
The wonders of science who shall sing'
The radiant light it still must shed.
Not ours to soar on fancy's wing,
For by its knowledge we are lead.

[If Canada wishes to place this country under an
eternal debt of gratitude, she will export to us
some of the servant girls whom a lecturer r.t the
Imperial Institute on "The Maritime Provinces of
Canada," mentioned as among the resources of
Prince Edward Island. What are potatoes, oats,
lumber, wood-pulp, horses, and the other products
compared to these? -Daily Telegraph.]
(A letter found at the Colonial Office ad-
dressed to its highest official.
DEAJI SIR,—In this humble petition,
"Which I trust you will not disavow,
I merely point out a condition
That you may not happen to know.
A condition, Sir, fraught with disaster,
An evil unpleasantly rife.
Oh, help me the danger to master,
Assist, Sir, the servantless wife.
Enough of the Khaki Campaign, Sir,
No more of the Boers and DE WKT,
From African matters refrain, Sir,
Australian feting forget.
And bend all your talents and skill, Sir,
On a question that cries for redress,
On a socially serious ill, Sir—
Great Britain is quite servantless.
Yet, the remedy lies to your hand, Sir,
For Canada teems, so 1 hear,
With servants of all kinds. How grand,
Sir,
If all to these shores we could bear!
Oh, promise you will do your best, Sir;
We would |>ay them in wnges just
double
To what they receive in the West, Sir—•
Oil, do help us out of our trouble!
You have only to place an embargo
On ships leaving Canada's ports
That do not contain a large cargo
Of Canada's servants (all sorts).
What are pulp and potatoes and horses,
And lumber and oats—what are they,
To a maid who can wait through three
courses
And not be fatigued the next day?
Then send us a shipload of cooks, Sir,
Who can cook—say a chop or a steak—
Without searching through twenty odd
books, Sir—
And a simple milk pudding can make;
Who will rise before twelve in the
morning,
And expect not the use of the carriage,
Who do not in a pet give you warning
If some trifle you dare to disparage.
And of generals, sev'ral ship loads, Sir,
Not forgetting the " all-work " adept,
Who is needed in all those abodes, Sir,
Where " only one servant is kept."
With stair maids and scullery pack, Sir,
A hundred big liners or more;
Bring them hither in cruiser or smack, Sir,
At once to this servantless shore.
Let them come with the flowers in spring,
Sir,
In swarms like the midsummer fly,
Let every fresh cargo-boat bring, Sir,
An assortment to choose from. Oh, try
To do this. Oh, make an endeavour
To sweeten the matron's home-life
And she '11 bless you for ever and ever,
Yours truly, A SEKTANT-LESS WIFE.

then, everyone has the path made so easy.
Just before the Election I got a curd

was to record my vote.

everyone had the same advantage.
First R. No doubt. If there had been
any neglect in this, it would certainly
have been recorded in the newspapers.
Second R. Assuredly! and yet, in spite
of this, the Progressives have romped in:
It is shameful that this was allowed!
And only on account of apathy 1

NOT TOO PLAIN MORALITY.
[A Chicago judge has expressed his opinion that,
"although women are undoubtedly upon a higher
moral plane than men they are not so reliable upon
the witness-stand."]
"I HEAR you speak of a moral plane,
Which only women can ever attain;
Tell me, Judge—for I fain would go
To find this plane that you say you know—
Is it after a woman has taken an oath
That she makes such strides in her moral
growth?"
"Not then, not tlien, my child."
"Is it in the walls of a fusty court,
Where suits are long and memories short;
Where lawyers ask of a spinster's youth,
And miss by a decade or so the truth;
Where peril lurks 'in-atli the question
bland—
Shall I liiul it, Judge, on tho witness-
stand ?''
"Not there, not there, my child."
"I cannot tell you, my gentle Sir,
What I may mean you must only infer;
Somewhere there is a woman best
Where shc'cannot be put toVbrutal test.
Morals are not for the witness-box,
And should you seek for a paradox,
It is there, it is there, my child."
HOW TO SIGNAL TO MARS.
(Impression* after reading an article in
the current number of the " Pall Mall
Magazine.")
TAKE a flag about the size of Europe,
and mount it upon a staff the length of
the circumference of the earth. Then
generate sufficient electric fluid to illumi-
nate the material, which should be of a
conductive character. Having done this,
apply the fluid to the material with the
assistance of all the electric waves of the
solar system. Next change the laws of
Nature, in so much as they prevent tho
operation of waving so gigantic a flag as
the signal. Select a day when the condi-
tions are favourable, and put the apparatus
in operation. Then, if the Martians are
on the alert, they may possibly observe
the signal, and reply to it, say, iu a couple
of centuries. If you do not obtain a
manifestation, conclude that the inhabi-
tants of Mars are looking another way.

THE EVOLUTION OF A MUSICAL COMEDY.
The Poet
deserteth the
fair sex.
The Baritone.

Patter for
Patriots.

The Low
Comedian.
CANTO THE FOURTH.
THOUGH ladies first we 've criticised—I trust
With all respect which to the sex is due,—
The male performers, in their turn, we must
Subject to an impartial interview.
And hero, as in the ladies' realm, there seem
To be some mighty ones who reign supreme.
See this embodiment of manly grace,
Before whose glory everybody pales;
In the shop windows we shall find his face,
His voice is tuneful as the nightingale's.
He 's worshipped, with a fervour that's intense,
By female members of the audience.
The heroine is his alone, so he
Will sing her tender ballads now and then;
And his profession probably will be
Either the Army or tho bold R.N.
This gives an opportunity, in fact,
For one big " number " in the second act.
There, very likely in some foreign clime,
And with a chorus of the fullest size;
To swinging melody in martial time,
His own profession he will eulogise.
And people will applaud with emphasis
A composition something, say, like this :—
"Oh, we take him from the factory or mill,
(You will find out who the "him " is by and
bye);
We set to work and train him with a will,
And raise a martial ardour in his eye.
It does n'ot matter if he's not refined,
Or if he cannot even write his name;
For his want of education doosn't influence the
nation,
He 's a Gentleman in Khaki, all the same.
"O—oh, Gentleman in Khaki, you're a good
'mi, there 's no donbt,
And particularly useful as a chap to sing about:
May your pluck lie never failing, may your
aim be ever true,
Oh, Gentleman in Khaki, there 's my best top
note for you!
"But when one day the call to duty comes,
And he has got to face the nasty foe;
While all the air with patriotism hums
(Which fills the house and makes this number
go),
The gallant lad from danger does not flinch,
Oh, Englishmen, you really should rejoice;
Off he goes across the ocean, and you '11 notice
my emotion
By the most pathetic tremor in my voice."
[Chorus as before, only much slotver and mth
impressive pauses.
Then there's the low comedian, on whose
Shoulders a mighty burden oft is hung;
Nothing can check his efforts to amuse,
Even a "gag" but serves to loose his tongue.
An artist, in his own way unsurpassed,
Perhaps the hardest worker in the cast.
In awkward situations he will get
When he 's the chance. Anon he '11 condescend
The Ponderous
Potentate.
The Poet
toucheth on
topics.

To join in some light, rollicking duet,
A nimble-footed, fair, young lady friend;
Also, at frequent intervals, he tries
A change of costume or some quaint disguise.
One other type of artiste yet awaits
Our close inspection for a while. 'Tis he
Who in a lifelike way impersonates
Some potentate or lord of high degree.
Massive of frame; of voice distinct and clear,
Each word he utters you can plainly hear.
Who then is better suited to supply
That element which brightens the conclusions
Of many shows like this ;—for low and high
Welcome a song with topical allusions.
Following up my previous example,
Once more let me submit to you a sample.
I WANT TO BE TOPICAL.
"A person who holds an exalted position
In musical comedy land,
Will very soon find that the claim of tradition
Is something he cannot withstand
The humorous potentate 's always expected
To touch on events of the day;
And therefore a topical song I 've selected,
To sing in the Tisual way.
Cliorus.
"Oh, I 'vc got to be topical,
Topical!
Topical!
Encored by women and men;
If my vferses should pall
I get. fresh ones, that's all:
I 'm sure to be topical then!
"Of course I '11 allude to the fact that my nation,
Though probably one of the best,
Is lacking in products of civilization
That are such a boon te the west.
The halfpenny papers, Parisian drosses,
The latest Society play;
If I say that the Twopenny Tube a success is,
Is that being topical, eh?
"For I want to be topical,
Topical!
Topical!
Encored by women and men;
When the houses vibrate
Up at Notting Hill Gate
The Tube must be topical then!
"And turning to'matters more thrilling than ever,
I mean the South African War ;—
A verse about KRUOER, which need not be clever,
Is certain to win an encore.
And then I shall mention,—it may make a stir too,
The heroes we 're proud of to-day;
BADEN-POWELL and KITCHENER I can refer to,
I fancy they 're topical, eh?
"For I want to be topical,
Topical!
Topical!
Encored by women and men;
If I drag in Lord BOBS
(And can rhyme him with " jobs,")
Oh, shall I be topical then?" P. G.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PERFECT LETTER-WRITER.
PART III.
From a HoiiHe-Painter at Hackney la the
Dean of St. Paul's.
VERY REVEREND SIR,—In the interest
of Art I venture to address to you this
letter, which, I trust—written as it is in
:i cause, that of Art, as dear to yon, Mr.
DEAN, if I may say so, as to myself—you
will read with the attention due not to its
manner, since I am, unhappily, a man of
scanty education, but
to its matter, a letter,
in fact, dealing with
that mighty edifice,
the masterpiece of
CHRISTOPHER WREN,
which the nation, or
the Prime Minister,
or the London County
Council, or someone,
has committed to your
keeping.
Now it must be
evident to you, Mr.
DEAN, that the ex-
terior of St. Paul's,
untouched for cen-
turies, cannot remain
much longer in such
a deplorable condi-
tion. There is not a
house in Hackney
which has not re-
ceivetl three coats of
good oil paint, or, at
least, a wash of colour,
during a much shorter
period.
1 have, therefore,
elaborated a scheme,
of which I am sure
you would approve,
for the entire paint-
ing. Jt is evident
t jat a cathedral should
not be treated as a
mere ordinary build-
ing, but that the arts
of graining and mar-
bling should be freely
employed. I do not,
No one can deny that he is making the
interior extremely bright and cheerful.
I am not acquainted with any building in
Hackney so gay in appearance, and this
not-withstanding the fact that he has not
yet availed himself of the arts of graining
and marbling to increase the tasteful
splendour of his work. Why, then, has
he left the exterior in such a black and
gloomy condition? It cannot be from
regard for the mere architectural features,
since he has not hesitated to alter these

however, propose that the whole surface
should be marbled. The mouldings, and all
the other lines of the structure, should be
emphasized by vermilion, Naples yellow,
Prussian blue, Brunswick green, and other
colours calculated to enliven the gloomy
heaviness of the structure externally, in
the same manner as they have already
been employed to adorn the interior.
The. mention of the internal decoration
compels me to say that it has never been
my custom to depreciate the work of
other tradesmen. Still, I am forced to say
that the decorator at Hammersmith, who
has hitherto been engaged upon this job,
has shown a curious remissness in alto-
gether neglecting the external paint'ng.
internally when he perceived that his
judgment in architecture was superior to
that of WREN.
As ho has not undertaken the external
painting, 1 can offer my services without
any breach of professional etiquette. I
may add that, by observing the colours
you have permitted him to use, I have
learnt that you and he think, as I do,
that brilliance should be our first aim,
and I have designed tho external de-
coration accordingly.
Trusting that our mutual interest in
Art will seem to you, Mr. DEAN, a suffi-
cient reason for my intrusion, I have the
honour to be, Very Reverend Sir, your
obedient srrvant, P. GREEN.

No. V.—THE YOUNG MAN WHO DIDN'T.
COLD silence reigned in the room. The
man-servant -with noiseless activity had
set the card-table and disappeared, clos-
ing the door gently after him. MURIEL
stared into the fire. Ever and anon
aromatic cloudlets of cigar smoke sailed
past her. Once he broke the burdensome
silence by setting down his coffee cup
with a clangour that almost made her
start. Then there was a piff-biff. He
had thrown the moiety j
of his weed into the
fire with a gesture of
unrestrained impa-
tience. Now she knew
it was coming. The
words she had antici-
pated for four months.
Four sweet months of

He was so handsome,
so markedly superior

Had it not been in
the keeping of MONTY
PIPSTONE any time

The man rose, and
came nearer to the
girl. His face was
working strangely.
There was a drawn
look, that told of hid-
den agony. His flsts
were clenched, and
once he raised them
"Forgive me," said PIPSTONE in re-
morseful tones, seizing her slim wrists
and peering into her tear - wet eyes.
"You shall, you must, when you hear
what I have to say."
MURIEL gave a despairing sob.
"Don't make my punishment harder.
It is now almost more than I can bear.
To see you, the only true queen of my
heart suffering through my words, for
ever so short a moment tears me into a
thousand pieces of living agony. I know
I was wrong. Acoward, I suppose, to go
on treading the primrose path of love,
knowing to what end. I know I should

suppress it, I know; but tho thought that
to reveal it would separate us kept mo
mute. And now"
MURIEL was crying softly.
"At the Club I am avoided. Members
pass me by suspiciously; the servants eye
me curiously, as if I were some extinct
monster of antiquity. My friends are
falling from me like leaves from autumn-
stricken trees. Acquaintances who were
wont to tip the cheery nod now let mo go
unacknowledged, or frown sullenly on me.

and raised a hand in silent agony.
"MONTY I" she implored with wide
staring eyes.
"Ah! It must come," the man cried,
his whole frame shaken with the ex-
tremity of his passion. "For four months
we have dwelt in Elysium. Given our-
selves up to the delicious reverie of

drawing as quietly as possible. I saw—
none clearer—in what a false position I
was placed. That I had no right to be

"Ah ! some social misdemeanour!"
The man loosed his hold of her wrists.
"It was absurd to imagine that I could
pursue the routine of pleasure imposed
by another season, without someone of
average perspicuity discovering in what
manner I fell short of tho social equip-
ment with which I am accredited. I
should have torn down with a morally
courageous hand the sign of 'elegible,'

A. By having cloth of a new colour.
Q. Would quality or price bo material?
A. No, so long as expense was a

Q. Would you discard gold lace?
A. I would increase its use in all

Chorus.
TWENTY heart-sick ladies vie

Every morning fervently
Wishing, wishing we were not.
Twenty married ladies we,
And our fate we may not alter;
If we dare to mutiny
They will send us to Gibraltar!
[The babies, appalled at this prospect,
howl unanimously.
Saphir (as soon as she can make herself
heard). Our mornings go in stilling

[All yawn, including the babies.
Chorus.
Twenty heart-sick ladies we, etc.
Angela (sighs). It's a dreadful thing that
we should all have married officers in the
Army.
Saphir. And all have to live at Alder-
shot.
Ella. All except Lady JANE.
Saphir. But she married a Duke.
Ella. I don't see why that should make
any difference.
Angela. You wouldn't expect a Duchess
to live in the provinces. She couldn't be
spared.
filla. What do you mean?
Angela. No Duchess is allowed to be out
of London during the season. There are
hardly enough of them to go round as it is.
Saphir. I never imagined that when we
were married we should find ourselves so
completely " out of it."
All (indignant!;/). Out of it!
Saphir. Yes, out of it. Out of the
world, the fashion, what you please.
Afetheticism is out of vogue now, of
course, but there have been lots of
fascinating "movements" since then.
There 's been IBSEN and tho Revolt of the
Daughters, and AUBREY BEARDSLEY and
the Decadence, and MAETERLINCK. The
world has been through all these wonder-
fully thrilling phases since 1880, and
where are WE?
Angela (remonstrating). We read about
them in tho ladies' papers.
Saphir. Read about them! What's the
good of reading about them? I want to be
in them. I want to live my life. (Shakes
her baby fiercely. It raises a howl.)
Ella (rushing to the rescue). Take care,
take care! Poor darling! it '11 have a fit.
Saphir. Take it, then (Throws it to
ELLA). I 'm tired of it. What's the good
of buying a complete set of back numbers
of the Velloio Book, and reading them,
too—(General astonishment at this feat)—
if you can't even shake your baby without
making it squall. 1 'd never have married
Colonel CALVERLEY if I had thought of
that!
Angela. Nor I Major MURGATROYD.
(Sings.)
When first I consented to wed,
I said, " I shall never come down
To passing my life
As an officer's wife,
In a second-rate garrison town."
I said, " I shall live in Mayfair,
With plenty of money to spare,
Have admirers in flocks,
Wear adorable frocks,
And diamonds everywhere."
Yes, that's what 1 certainly said
When first I consented to wed.
I thought—on the day was wed—
I could reckon with perfect propriety
On filling a place
With conspicuous grace
In the smartest of London Society.
1 said, "It is easy to see
I shall be at the top of the tree,
And none of the millions
Of vulgar civilians
Will venture to patronize me!"
Yes, that "s what I foolishly said
When first I consented to wed.
As the song ends, enter Colonel
CALVKRLEY, Major Mi KOATROYU,
and the other officers, in uni/orin
<is from parade. The ladies groan.
So do the babies.
Colonel. Hullo! Groans! Whafs all
this about?
Saphir. If you only knew how it pains
us to see you in those preposterous
clothes.
Officers. Preposterous 1
Angela. Perfectly preposterous. You
know they are.
Major. If by preposterous you mean not
conspicuously well adapted for active
service, we cannot deny it.
Angela. Of course you can't. Your uni-
forms are useless and pretentious. To
tho educated eye they are not even
beautiful.
Officer (horrified). Not beautiful!
Saphir. Certainly not. If they were,
you would not be so unwilling to be seen
about in them.
Col. (haughtily). It is not etiquette in
:he British Army for an officer ever to be
seen in his uniform. It isn't done!
Saphir. And why not? Because he is
ashamed of it. He wants to be dressed
like a soldier, not like a mountebank.
How can anyone respect a uniform that's
only meant for show?
Major. That's true. But the ladies? If
it wasn't for our gorgeous frippery they
wouldn't fall in love with us.
Angela (crossly.) Nonsense. Women like
soldiers because they are brave, not
because they wear red coats. Any Tommy
could tell you that.
Col. (sarcastically). Indeed?
Angela. Yes. SAPHIR, tell Colonel CAL-
VERLEY the story of WILLIAM STOKES.
Saphir (sings). Once WILLIAM STOKES
went forth to woo,
A corporal he of the Horse Guards (Blue),
He thought all housemaid hearts to storm
With his truly magnificent uniform.
But the housemaids all cried " No, no, no,
Your uniform 's only meant for show,
Your gorgeous trappings are wicked
waste,
And your whole get-up 's in the worst of
taste."
All. The worst of taste?
Saphir. The worst, of taste!
These quite unfeeling
Very plain dealing
Ladies cried in haste—
"Your uniform, BILLY,
Is simply silly
And quite in the worst of taste!"
Poor WILLIAM took these cries amiss,
Being quite unaccustomed to snubs like
this.
At last he explained, by way of excuse,
His gorgeous clothes weren't made for
use.
His elaborate tunic was much too tight
To eat his dinner in, far less fight.
It was only meant to attract the eye
Of the less intelligent passer-by.
All. The passer-by?
Siiph/r. The passer-by!
And so poor BILLY,
Feeling quite silly,
Threw up the Horse Guards (Blue),
And now in the Park he
Appears in Khaki,
And greatly prefers it too!
Colonel. That's all very well, and 1
dare say you 're right in what you say,
but you 'II never get the War Office to
see it.
Afajor. They 're too stupid.
Saphir. Was it the War Office who sent
US to Aldershot?
Major. Yes.
Saphir. You 're quite right. They are
stupid!
Colonel. What's the matter with Aider-
shot?
Angela. It's dull, it's philistine, it's
conventional. ' And to think that we were
once ^Esthetic!

Colonel. Listen, and I will tell you—
(Sings.)
When you once have your commission, if
you want a high position in the army
of the King,
You must tout for the affections of the
influential sections of the Inner Social
Ring.
If you 're anxious for promotion, you must
early get a notion of the qualities com-
manders prize;
You must learn to play at polo, strum a
banjo, sing a solo, and you 're simply
bound to rise!
For everyone will say
In the usual fatuous way:—
"If this young fellow's such a popular
figure in High Society
Why, what a very competent commander
of a troop this fine young man must be!"
You must buy expensive suits, quite the
shiniest of boots, and a glossy hat and
tall,
For if you 're really clever you need
practically never wear your uniform
at all.
You probably will then see as little of
your men as you decently can do,
And you '11 launch a thousand sneers at
those foolish Volunteers, who are not a
bit like you!
And those Volunteers will say
When you go on in that way :—
"If this young man's such an unconcealed
contempt for the likes of such as we
What a genius at strategy and tactics too
this fine young man must be!"
When, your blunders never noted, you are
rapidly promoted to the snuggest berth
you know,
Till we see you at Pall Mall with the Army
gone to—well, where the Army should
not go.
When your country goes to war your
abilities will awe all the foemen that
beset her,
And if you make a mess of it, of course
we're told the less of it the country
hears the bettor!
And you '11 hear civilians say,
In their usual humble way,
If this old buffer is a General of Division,
and also a G. C. B.,
Why, what a past master of the art of war
this fine old boy must be!
Sapliir. Do you mean that you 'It never
get a berth at the Horse Guards, any of
you?
Colonel (sadly). It's most unlikely.
Saphir. Then my patience is exhausted.
I shall apply for a judicial separation.
Angela. So shall I.
.Ladies. We shall all apply for a judicial
separations.
Officers. Impossible!
Angela. Oh, yes, we shall; we cannot
consent to remain at Aldershot any longer.
At any moment a new movement in the
world of Art or Letters may begin in
London, and WE shall not be in it. The
thought is unendurable. We must go and
pack at once. [Exeunt.

A FATAL SUCCESS.
AMINADAB CARRUTHERS JONES
Was steady as can be,
He was, as everybody owns,
Of strict sobriety.
This man invented something great
(I think it was a gun);
And then there camo a weary wait
Ere victory was won.
Ho fought a monster in disguise,
The ruddiest of tape,
Which strangled private enterprise
In every size and shape.
At last, at last, success was his,
Success for all his schemes!
He worked a miracle—that is,
He realised nis dreams.
"Adopted" was the gladsome word
Which filled his heart with glee—
That night poor JONES was as absurd
A sight as you could see.
He staggered home to Mrs. J.,
His face suffused with pink,
And this is what he had to say:
"M'RIA, wha' you think?
"I shay, goodole redtapshafool,
M'RIA, wha' you shay?
We 're joll' goodfellers, tooroolool,
Hi, tooroolooroolay."
INTOXICATED WITH SUCCESS,
He fairly lost his wits;
The happy home, as you may guess,
He pounded all to bits.
In sorry degradation sunk,
He showed himself a " rip."
With pure success our friend was
drunk,
No liquor passed his lip.
And now, good friends, a warning
take,
Pray, pay especial heed,
Success should make you fear and
quake—
Beware how you succeed!
THEOPHRASTU8 UP TO DATE.
"Literary Characters."
THE NEW PUBLISHER.
NEW Publishing may be denned as the
puffing of unknown authors for the sake
of gain.
The New Publisher is one who will do
his own reviewing, and fill many columns
of the papers with eulogies of his own
publications. Warming to the work, ho
will hire sandwich-men to parade the
streets proclaiming their aspirations or
their sin. Great is his belief in anony-
mity, and having propounded the riddle
he is well pleased to keep silent and reap
the harvest from a puzzled world. He is
very apt to bring discredit on his pro-
fession.
THE NEW JOURNALIST.
New Journalism is the framing of fic-
titious sayings and doings at the pleasure
of him who makes journals.
The New Journalist is a person who will
condemn a prisoner before he has' been
tried, or ruin a man's reputation to sell
a single issue of his paper. When a sen-
sational trial is in the courts he will be
quick to scent out any savoury gossip
and horrible revelation. It is quite in his
manner, too, to publish the evidence of a
witness who has not yet appeared in the
box. Hearing that a degree of frost has
been registered during the night, he
hastens to write a par. on "Blizzards at
Brixton," adding, that Wandsworth and
Wimbledon are in winter's icy grasp. He
is also called Yellow.
THE NEW WAR CORRESPONDENT.
New War Correspondence is a distress-
ing indifference to style and subject,
where popularity is concerned.
The New War Correspondent Is one
who, though he has seen nothing of war,
and knows as little of politics, will cheer-
fully go to the front, and write home
criticism of the General's tactics and of
the Government. There is no need for
him to leave his quarters in order to
give a graphic description of the latest
battle. He is apt to refer to a scout-
ing reconnaissance as an advance in
force, adding that on this day he messed
with the Regiment who had looted a
barrel of whisky. If half-a-dozen Boers
are dislodged from a kopje, he will
describe it as a great victory, though he
will point out that, but for the blundering
of the General engaged, the loss of five
British officers might have been avoided.
He is quite likely to write a novel, in
which he will discourse much of "Glass-
eye," "Pom-pom" and ""Ard-work."
He is very apt to use this kind of phrase,
"The lioness of Britain whelps heroes
still." He is a "quill-driving lump of
sin."

parodists that the author feels it as all-
commanding upon him to give the letters
to the world.
The story that echoes through the fol-
lowing pages shows how hopelessly the
author has fallen under the influence of
certain eminent writers. When at length
he shakes off this influence, he Minis to
his horror that he is inarticulate. So
long has he imitated the method and style
of others that he has no longer any style
of his own; he has become a mechanical
mocking-bird. Therein lies the tragedy;
for a man who cannot write a natural
love-letter must give up the role of lover.
LETTER I.
(Written under the influence of Q-rge
M-r-d-th.)
BELOVED,—With this letter lies overt
the first page of the scented volume of

"JUSP IS TIMS FOR THB CENSTS, STR I'
love. Its passionate perfume narcotises
my soul with verbal-tone pictures, and
drives me with its harmonious discords
into polysyllabic conceits. Thero is an
obscurity, dearest (if, mayhap, obscure I
shall seem) which arises from excess of
light. On the sensitised brain of the
ordinary soul this super-radiance is re-
gistered as shadow, and, indeed, deve-
lopes as such. You, beloved, would scorn
such a negative test.
And now to psalm the praises of Cupid,
who liketh not the naked, unattractive
highway that leadeth direct to wedding
bells, but glorieth, Ariel-like, in the
intricate byeways of intellectual magic-
loving ordeals, while shunning marriages
that are not amazing. And now, dearest,
take a deep breath, for I am about to
enter upon a glittering sea of metaphors,
and goodness knows when a full-stop will
arrest my declamatory barque. To-night I
opened my casement (there is no window
in my room) while mine ears drank in—
Nature has been kind in gifts aural—the
bitter-sweet passion song of the nightin-
gale, which entranceth my soul with the
value of archaic words and recondite
phrases, albeit somewhat sense-betwisted
from the natural meaning accorded them
by the upper-shelf haunting dictionary;
maddeneth my heart with such an ecstasy
as the gods feel who, looking down upon
the stage of life, rejoice in the pantomimic
vagaries of low comedians gallery-espied—
somewhere in the Lane of existence;
greeteth my body (my soul and heart have
already been disposed of) with some
chance catarrh (that I super-gladly suffer)
which, clasping my throat in its ardent
embrace, or whispering in sibilous periods
to the penetralia of the bronchi Dearest
heart of my heart, I have lost my place,
and where my original nominative was, alas,
Iwotnot. So farewell. The fount must cease
to flow: inspiration has become siccate.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE EVOLUTION OF A MUSICAL COMEDY.
• CANTO THE FIFTH.
The Press THE masterpiece towards completion tends,
Paragraphs. And on its steady journey to success
It may be pushed along by kindly friends
Who chance to be connected with the Press.
In many a chatty paper, far and near,
Notes on the new production will appear.
Starting.with just a line or so at first,
These paragraphs are few and far between;
But ere the piece for long has been rehearsed
On ev'ry side accounts of it are seen;
All of them helping, in some slight degree,
To rouse the public curiosity.
Soon, with an ardour uncontrolled and hot,
The journalists crowd thickly on the scent;
Bach tries to find out details of the plot
(If there should be a plot by accident).
Failing in this, he very often gleans
Descriptions of the dresses and the scenes.
The Illustrated Or, knowing public interest runs high,
Interview. The authors and composers he '11 pursue,
And,.at their private residences, try
To get the honour of an interview.
Sometimes their latest photos they will fetch,
And let him reproduce them,—say in SketrJi.
Let us now return for a while to the piece itself. It is far
enough advanced to go into rehearsal. This necessitates our
approaching the theatre,—and by the stage door. But before
taking what may be to the reader such a momentous step,
perhaps it would be as well to propitiate the fates, and do
homage in fitting fashion to this mystic barrier which guards
tie world behind the footlights.
INVOCATION TO THK STAGE Doon.
Hail! O thou magic and mysterious portal,
Strangely attractive to the guileless mortal,
Who, though possessed of an inquiring mind,
Has never had the chance to "go behind."
The real from the unreal thou dost divide;
And those to whom the entree is denied,
Heed not the voice of elders, who declare
That they are building castles in the air.
Dazzled by all the splendour of to-day
They see in thee the one and only way
To Fairyland; and feel a hatred for
Thy careful and suspicious janitor;
Who, watching from the corner of his eye,
Will let no unfamiliar face pass by.
O foolish ones, why will ye not be wise?
When will the outside public realise
That through this mystic door, for many a one,
The road to disillusionment may run.
Alas ! the youthful dream of beauty stops
When one has been confronted by the " props.";
While as for Fairyland, the only things
That will suggest it are perhaps the " wings."
Rehearsal of
the Chorus.
Preliminaries will be started by
Rehearsals of the chorus, who will be
Summoned as soon as possible to try
The music, full of haunting melody.
Female and male, henceforth they must not shirk
The drudgery attendant on such work.
Pity the chorus master, who will sit
Surrounded by the many-voiced throng;
The Chorus
singeth for
Itself.
Taking them through the music bit by bit,
And interrupting when they sing it wrong.
Marking the time for them, "One, two; one, two!"
Shouting out " Ladies, that will never do I"
No orchestra his efforts will assist,
As has been, and will be in future days;
Only the tinkling of a pianist,
Who on his instrument serenely plays. •
This sort of thing is steadily maintained.
Until, at length, proficiency is gained.
The idiosyncrasies of the chorus must often have struck the
reader. They are always on the spot when wanted, and always
willing to sing. But let them speak for themselves.
SONG OF THE CHORUS.
The principal characters wander about
Wherever the action may take them,
And though it may strike you as funny, no doubt,
We never, no never forsake them.
To regions remote they may possibly fly,
To deserts unpleasant and sandy;
But no matter where these localities lie,
They 're sure to find some of us handy.
Our voices are clear and sonorous,
And no situation can floor us;
Both early and late or
From Pole to Equator,
There 's no getting rid of the Chorus I
Supposing a musical number is due,
For which we 're responsible partly;
The stage may be empty, but give us the cue,
And see how we take it up smartly.
To come on in clusters of two or of three
We 're always remarkably willing!
We enter from Centre, from P, and O. P.
(Result of elaborate drilling.)
We look as if nothing could bore us;
Though dreadful disaster bangs o'er us,
Sopranos and basses
Wear smiles on their faces,
You cannot discourage the Chorus!
Act One may present us as civilized folk,
But, as you perhaps may have reckoned,
We probably shall our identities cloak
In starting upon Act the Second.
The lady who was a Society belle,
Supposing the piece should demand it,
May next be a peasant;—the Regent Street swell
May turn to a bloodthirsty bandit.
And no one can really ignore us;
The audience sitting before us,
Our value confesses;
In tights or in dresses,
They liven things up, do the Chorus!
Meanwhile, in other quarters, matters are being rapidly
pushed forward. The scene-painters, having submitted models
and had the same approved, are hard at work on the two or
more "sets." The costumiers are materialising the ideas of
the designer, and turning out elaborate creations which are to
make the piece a -well-dressed one. It is high time to call a
rehearsal of the principals. Accordingly, one day, the members
of the company assemble on the stage. Some of the more
favoured ones may have had the piece explained to them
previously by the authors, but the majority will have to obtain
a vague idea of it, by reading through their parts.
(To be continued.) P. O.

PHILANTHROPY IN THE WEST-END.
(Speech designed for Lord ROSEBERY on the occasion of his open-
ing a Loan Collection of Pictures in the Lobby of the Bouse
of Commons.)
MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,—I cannot think
Why I should give this opening address,
Except that I have leisure more than most
And often undertake these little turns.
Since flrst, some three-and-thirty years ago,
I entered what ia known as public life,
I have remarked a desultory change
In Members' manners, chiefly for the worse.
Time was, some three-and-thirty years ago
(Excuse my mentioning the date again),
Before the Irish occupied our thoughts,
When the behaviour of the Lower House
Was almost worthy of the Peers themselves.
Home Rule is dead (I helped to dig its grave,
And made an after-dinner speech above it),
But several naughty passions roused thereby
Have wrought corruption in our polished style
Ancl even compromised the House of Lords,
Where I myself only the other day
Observed a noble Marquis who betrayed
A " lamentable and unseemly" tone—
To cite the epithets I then employed.
It is in hope of working some reform
Which may effect itself by moral suasion,
And ease the burdens of our brave police.
That I expose these pictures which include
The hundred greatest works of human Art,
Selected by my friend, Lord AvEBruv.
OVID (in ancient days) regarded Art
As an emollient of savage natures;
But Art is very long, and takes its time;
And he were optimist who should expect
That for a Member passing through this Lobby
(Possibly under force and upside down)
In course of transit simply to have seen
A CONSTABLE suspended on the wall
Should be the sudden means of his conversion
And change a FLAVIN to a CHESTERKIELD.
Yet if he only gave sufficient time
To rapt and steady contemplation of
Some useful masterpiece—a RAPHAEL or
A MICHAEL ANGELO (I '11 ask the Press,
Who claim the copyright of these remarks,
Not to report him as VON ANGELI),
Then I believe that in this stately House
There is no Hooligan so coarse of hide
But what the brute would ultimately own
The Brummelising influence of Art.
Nor has this choice collection been arranged
Merely to mollify the rampant kind
And cause " the ape and tiger " to expire.
Apart from general humanising aims,
An intimate regard has here been shown
For individual Members' private needs.
Thus it is hoped that this sublime chef d'ceuvre—
Lord Roberts playing with the little Boer—
(Illustrative of peaceful Ignorance
Imbibing Wisdom from a Warrior Chief)
May chance to catch my LORD OF LANSDOWNE'S eye.
The Soul's Awakening has been secured
In order to divert my noble friend
The Duke of DEVONSHIRE. Those chaste designs,
HOGARTH'S progressive series of The Rake,
Should give an added breadth to SAMUEL SMITH.
The picture of The Princes in the Tower
Might soften Lord HUGH'S adamantine breast;
And all the house of CECIL must remark
This rather pleasing genre interior,
The Happy Family. Our Liberal Leader
is suitably accommodated with
The Choice of Hercules, while LANDSEER'S gem,
The Time of Peace, with careless lambs and goats
Bleating about the rusted cannon's throat,
Should meet the Anti-British-Army views
Of HARCOURT. .Dignity and Impudence,
By the same master's hand, is meant to warn
Precocious genii like Master WINSTON,
Not to usurp the seat of Mr. BOWLES.
That rustic scene, The Dam beside the WEIR,
Speaks for itself; and, finally,
La Source, that emblematic nude, is loaned
Exclusively for WILFRID LAWSON'S needs.
I need not stimulate my audience
With further instances how Art may be
"Applied" to persons. 'Tis my honest hope
That each of you will help in pointing out
To other Members those respective works
Which strike you as applicable to them;
Always remembering our primal aim—
To civilise the mob. I ought to add
That catalogues are free, a gift from GORST,
Another of his many services
To Education.
Let me now declare
This Gallery open. May its various oils
Assuage the troubled waters round our bark;
And may a bounteous blessing wait upon
These efforts to reclaim the West-End rouprh. O. S.
OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
MESSRS. HUTCHINSON have issued the first volume of a work
which promises to take a favoured place in the library. It
deals with The Living Kac.cn of Mankind, providing a popular
illustrated account of the customs, habits, feasts and cere-
monies of the human race throughout the world. To the
proper study of mankind no equally original and comprehen-
sive work has before been undertaken. The letterpress,
edited and partly written by Mr. II. N. HUTCHINSON, assisted
by eminent specialists, deals with masterful brevity with the
physical features of the races of mankind, their clothing,
ornaments, food, dwellings, weapons, habits and customs,
their modes of thought and mental characteristics. Without
minimising the value of the text, my Baronite believes it is the
illustrations that will mark the supremacy of the work. They
are taken on the spot, in the Fiji Islands, New Guinea,
Australia, Tasmania, Siam, China, the Andaman Islands,
Bokhara, Siberia, and all the ends of the earth. Such a
varied collection of living figures so admirably reproduced,
has not before been seen between the covers of a single
volume.
There has been such a run on the "Masters" in fiction,
that, as an attraction, it would have been better had Miss BESSIE
HATTON chosen some other title for her novel than The Master
Passion (C. ARTHUR PEARSON, Limited). However, "a rose by
any other name" will have the roseate effect, so we may accept
this latest " master-piece " with satisfaction, even if it be not
quite so " masterful " as the name implies. The plot is of the
smallest consequence. Evidently it is intended for a study in
the evolution or development of character. A kind of Taming
of the Shrew. The heroine starts as a most impossible specimen
of modern girlhood, and though she eventually tones down into

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
something of an ordinary human being, she never quite loses
that unorthodox temperament -which is apparently the distinc-
tion of most up-to-date heroines. The very best parts of the
book are decidedly in the life at the French convent. Here
Miss HATTON is thoroughly at home. Her descriptions of the
happy uneventful routine of existence in a convent school are
done with a charming delicacy of touch. Of the many female
characters, the most distinctly and pleasantly drawn one is
that of the nun, Madame Veronique de Salles. Bat why Salles?
Should it not be Soles? "Salles" is so suggestive of "salles"
for music, de lecture, d'attente, etc. An interesting story, but
overweighted with this idea of a " Master Passion."
A Narrow Way (METHUEN) will add to the growing reputa-
tion of MARY FINDLATBR. It is the story of a bright, clever,
pure-minded, unselfish girl, cooped up in the narrow cage of
the Edinburgh home of a dour Calvinistic aunt. "With con-
summate, perhaps unconscious art, these grim surroundings
serve to bring out the charm of KITTY. My Baronite strongly
recommends the Baron's readers to find and follow A Narrow
Way.
What Men call Love (WmTK & Co.) is a sad, sad story of
human passion, painful as such stories, to be true to life, must
always be, told by LUCAS CLEVE with strong grip of character,
considerable power of description, both of the picturesque
scenery in which the action takes place, and of the naturally
dramatic situations through which it is worked out to the
end. "Their Penance" would have been a more accurate
title for the story, telling as it does of the agony of self-
reproach, of savage vengeance, and of suffering willingly
undergone in expiation of a crime, for which forgiveness has
been freely and fully accorded, but too late. Decidedly a
powerful work. The gleam of sunshine at the finish relieves
the human tragedy and consoles the tender-hearted.
BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
OHE! MON MAIRE!
"NOT to-day, Baker; " no, nor on any other day, Worshipful
DANIEL BAKER, Mayor of Folkestone, in spite of your anxiety,
as displayed in that letter to The Times last week, to get the post
through from Paris to Glasgow, and vice versa, taking London
en route and advancing business by, as this "DANIEL come to
judgment" hath it, some twenty-four hours. As if letters
couldn't wait! As if -business would not be all the better con-
ducted iu consequence of business-like men having time to
ponder and consider, instead of replying hurriedly, and com-
mitting themselves in a second to what they may possibly
regret "it may be for years, it may be for ever!" Answer in
haste, repent at leisure.
And what other loss will there be—not to the business men,
but to the travellers? Why the loss of a genuinely good lunch
at the Calais Buffet, taken by those who know what to eat,
drink and avoid," in the space of at least twenty-five minutes
by English and Continental time (would it were an hour!),
and digested quietly and pleasantly, and probably "slept
upon " during the journey; so that the traveller, feeling like
Richard, when he was "himself again," arrives in Paris with
the makings of another excellent appetite which will be in
working order by the hour of dinner. And the wise and
worshipful DANIEL (he '11 find himself in a lions' den without
celestial aid to rescue him) points out that for those who must
feed there is luncheon provided in the restaurant car, so that,
en route, the traveller can sample a specimen of poulet and
inn rouge. Has the worthy Mayor of Folkestone personally
tried this? Probably; and ho may bo impervious to indiges-
tion (O lucky official!), or His Worship may have had an
exceptionally fortunate experience. I, moi qui parle, have done
it once, or twice, but, as the song says, "Never again with
you, ROBIN I" We were jolted, to this side and that, we were

clutching and shaken, and the waiters were staggering; the
knives and forks became a danger, glasses jingled and col-
lided, bottles were grasped, and the whole meal was a most
upsetting and "upset" affair. Perhaps the occasion was an
exceptional experience; but evidence is against that suppo-
sition.
Via Folkestone for Boulogne to Paris, with twenty minutes
allowed for refreshment, and no other stoppage of any sort
save five minutes at Amiens, is certainly the quickest and
cheapest, supposing fares unaltered, for those in a deuce of a
hurry, and who "needs must " because a certain personage,
name unmentionable to ears polite, is their engine-driver; but
for those who would prolong life, see good days, and take
everything easily, we adhere to the London via Calm's route to
Paris, with as much time as one can possibly get at Calais,
even if there bo a few francs more to pay for the extra forty
minutos' journey which saves the traveller from dyspepsia,
and gives him rest after refreshment.
Business is business, Mr. Mayor, and we don't want it to be
less business-like: but where there 's more haste there 's less
speed and, on the whole, where there is one letter which it is
of vital importance (financially) to answer at once, there will be
some ninety-nine to which the answers will be all the better for
keeping. Besides, how about telegraphing, telephoning, private
code cabling, and Marconi signalling ?" Long life and success
to the Mayor" of Folkestone, and may he come to a better
mind on the subject of De Londres ii Paris et retour.

DON JOSE. This, the motto of most

exemplified to-night iu Strange Case of
General COLVILE. On verge of midnight;
House densely crowded; atmosphere in
that electric condition that portends pos-
sible disaster. PRINCE ARTHUR speaking
an hour ago cleverly attempted to put
gloss on the case.
"The House," he said, amidst storm of
cheers and counter-cheering, "is re-
solving itself into a grand jury on ques-
tions of strategy in order to say whether
there is a case to go to the common jury
in the shape of some military Court of
Inquiry, which is to reverse or indorse
as it thinks fit, the verdict of the Com-
mander-in-Chief."
ASQUITH, in one of those masterpieces
of lucid, cogent statement with which
from time to time he illuminates debate,
put the fact more accurately. "General
COLVILE'S case was," he said, "considered
by the Secretary of State. All the in-
formation available being brought before
the authorities, he was deliberately
reinstated in his command. First he was
acquitted, then reinstated, and after all
that was done a Court of Inquiry was
held behind his back, at which he was
not represented, of the evidence produced
at which we have no knowledge, and of
the charges neither ho nor we at this

having performed ill or well in the field,
is reinstated in his post after considera-
tion of his conduct by the most compe-
tent authorities he ought not, according

to the rules of justice, according to the
traditions of fair play, and the practice
that prevails iu every branch of life—
social, political, or business, to have that
decision reversed, and his status taken
away without some opportunity of answer-
ing the new charges preferred against
him."
That was the plain and simple demand.
House of Commons shrank instinctively
from complicity with anything resembling
a DKEYKUS case. Did not presume to
offer opinion whether COLVILE was justi-
fied in his action at Lindley. DICKSON-
POYNUEU, who was on the spot, varied this
attitude. He, a trained soldier with per-
sonal knowledge of the whole affair,
emphatically adquitted COLVILK of blame.
The House on its part simply demanded
reference of the case to a Military Court
of Enquiry before whom, in presence
of the accused, the whole evidence should
be considered.
Question entirely free from party
politics; speakers equally divided between
two camps supported General COLVILE'S
demand. In the two nights' debate only
one voice raised in support of position
assumed on Treasury Bench. WINSTON
CHURCHILL, refraining from dealing with
the particular case, urged Secretary of
State as a matter of principle not to budgo.
To-night Leader of House, with keen in-
stinct of danger, made question one of
confidence in the Ministry; also dragged
in BOBS, who must be getting a little tired
of the tactics.
"Fire away, Gentlemen, if you like,"
said the Master of Legions; "if you do,
you '11 hit BOBS."
Even afterthis, things looked nasty; cer-
tainly if Ministerial majority were left with
free hand the appeal for a court-martial
would have been carried by acclaim. At
this crisis DON JOSE put up to repeat
PRINCE ARTHUR'S solemn warning to whom
it might concern. If amendment were
carried, BOBS would go, Ministers woultl
resign and (this arrow DON JOSE sped from
his own quiver) the British Army would
be destroyed.
After this, only one thing for good
Ministerialists to do. They went into the
Lobby almost to a man, and the veteran
soldier seated under the Gallery listening
to the long debate was finally broken.
Business done.—Motion for Enquiry into
COLVILK case negatived by 202 votes
against 148.
Thursday iiiyht.— House gathered to
discuss vote of eighty - eight millions
sterling proposed in Army Estimates.
Sum beats the record; involves question
underlying existence of the Empire;
House presumably anxious to approach
subject forthwith, bestowing upon it
every available moment of Sitting.
But there is QUINLAN'S Ass. Irish
Members insist that it shall be first at-
tended to. Like birth of JEAMES, the
early years of QUINLAN'S Ass are "wropt
in mist'ry." Suddenly, unexpectedly,
probably at a period when life's shadows
are lengthening, QUINLAN'S Ass has a
question all to itself on paper of House
of Commons; put and answered amid full
panoply of ordered Sitting; wigged and
gowned Speaker in the Chair; Sergeant-
at-Arms watchful at his post; Mace on
the table; eager circle of listeners. A
bye-wave of interest ripples round the
owner of the quadruped. QUINLAN? What
manner of man is he who owns an ass
that thrills Ireland with passion, and,
standing with meek obstinacy on floor
of House of Commons, bars progress of
vote of eighty-eight millions of sterling 'i
It was Mr. REDDY who, lightly throw-
ing a leg over the back of QUINLAN'S Ass,
trotted the beast down the floor of the
House. For one of his name, an Irish
Member to boot, he was singularly un-
ready of speech. This doubtless due to

seething indignation clogging his voice. Mention of QuiXLAN'S
Ass set every fibre in his body vibrating. Crowded House,
scarcely less excited, with difficulty followed the narrative.
As far as could be made.'out, there has been larceny in the
case of QDINLAN'S Ass. "Who stole the donkey? " is a question
often put by ribald crowds and never answered. Darkness of
equal depth brooded over the felonious attempt on QUINLAN'S
Ass. What Mr. REDDY succeeded in making clear was that
Quintan's Ass was " the only one to go before the grand jury
of Tullamore Assizes." Grand jury threw out the bill, and
QUINLAN'S Ass left the court without a stain on its character.
But charges had been incurred; the ratepayers were mulcted.
The Crown Solicitor, probably in peril of his life, meanly
suggested that the Attorney-General would pay costs out of
his pocket.
Now Mr. REDDY was coming to the point. With skilful appli-
cation of heel, he made QUINLAN'S Ass give out threatening
kick behind.
"Will the Attorney-General for Ireland pay the costs? " he
gurgled.
Vainly battling with emotion, ATKINSON, noting that breadth
of the table was between him and QuiNLAN'9 Ass, emphati-
cally answered " No, I will not!"
Movement of depression plainly visible on pendulous ears of
QUINLAN'S Ass as this cruel answer fell upon them ; quietly per-
mitted itself to be led forth by Mr. REDDY.
Haven't yet heard the last of the beast. SAHR tells me Irish
Members intend to ask leave to move the adjournment in order
to discuss case of QUINLAN'S Ass as a matter of urgent public
importance.
Business done.—Question of QUINLAN'S Ass and 121 others on
the Paper (majority of equal importance) disposed of, what
was left of Sitting devoted to Army Estimates.
Friday.—CHANCBU.OR OF EXCHEQUER, faced by deficit un-
equalled in modern times, at his wits' end to find new sources
of taxation. Jumps eagerly at suggestion lightly thrown out
by TIM HEALY in debate on Congested Districts (Ireland) Bill.
MACARTNEY lamented neglect by Board of Ulster, "although,"
he said, "the tenants there are worse off than those on the

CHAPTER X.
Hunting Types—The Man who rides a Bolter.
You can't be in the hunting field for more than a very short
time without meeting the man who rides a bolter. "Have no
truck with a puller," said the Colonel to me, when first as a
youngster I followed the hounds. "A puller's often a showy
horse, and when they bring him out to you from his stable and
make him do his paces up and down, or clear a hurdle in the
little field beyond, why you 're apt to think you've never in all
your life seen a nobler animal. There he goes, a great sinewy,
bony, upstanding chestnut, full of fire and courage, clean-
limbed, a proud jumper, and with an action that makes a man
feel as if he were riding on C springs. Yes, ray boy, that's all
very well when there are no hounds, and no other horses tear-
ing up to him and thundering along with snortings and pantings
that make him feel as if there was a devil let loose behind him
and he had to go his best and fastest to escape. Look at his
eye carefully. It 'a not really an honest eye—too much white
about it for that, and too little of that liquid intelligence that
shines in the eye of a good horse. However, you '11 buy him
probably, and then you '11 take him out with the hounds, and
then your mother ought to hang up a special votive tablet if
you come home with sound bones. That horse, my boy, turns
into an untamed streak of lightning—if you can imagine a
streak of lightning with a mouth as hard as that of an ARM-
STRONG gun, and a power of palling that turns your arms and
shoulders into a mass of aches. No, there's no pleasure to be
got out of a horse like that. Get rid of him anyhow; sell him,
pawn him; give him away; but don't keep him, or, if you do
keep him, don't ride him."
So spoke the Colonel, riding on his wiry flea-bitten grey—a
man bronzed by many suns and scarred in many fights, a keen
horseman and a joyous rider to hounds. I laughed, as is the
habit of youth, and promised to remember his words, and that
very day I saw JOHNNIE BARROWMORF. lugging and tugging on
the top of a huge bay, a mere robin on a round of beef.
JOHNNIE was the soul of good humour, but the amiability even
of his temper must have been exhausted by the innumerable
apologies he found himself compelled to dispense. He banged
into the master; he collided with the huntsman; he all but
rode over old Captain BODLER, who was fumbling about at a
small fence. He upset his best friend and lost him the best
run of the season, and then, getting away himself, he dis-
appeared like a flash in the dim distance, far beyond the
hounds and their music, a swiftly vanishing meteor, viewed
with amazement and fear by the rest of the field. His account
of that dreadful gallop is Homeric. I cannot recall the whole
terrible series of its incidents, the roads he clattered along,
the carts he avoided by a hair's breadth, the iron railings he
cleared, the gardens he crashed through, the villages he
terrified with his reckless speed, the dogs, the pigs, the hens
that he trampled on. Late at night a woe-begone wreck of the
once immaculate JOHNNIE arrived at his home. His horse had
finally hurled himself into an orchard, had fixed JOHNNIE,
bruised but happy in his release, between the branches of an
apple tree, and had then continued his flight into the unknown.
He (the horse, I mean) was found on the following day, minus
his saddle, in a neighbouring sea-port town, and was sold for
six pounds to go in a butcher's cart. That was the last I ever
heard of him, but I always pitied the butcher. »

Yet who can be wise at all times. Only a month later I was
mounted on my latest acquisition, the finest horse, I thought,
I had ever ridden. We were with a private pack of beagles,
and the hare kept running rings. When my brute saw the
hounds and heard them give tongue his whole nature changed.
He bounded this way and that; he bored, he flung his head
into the air and into my face, he took the bit in his infamous
teeth, tested my hands and arms, found his mouth had the
greater strength and endurance, and away he went. Wo
ended—the interval was a nightmare — down a twelve-foot
drop on to a large field-roller, the shafts of which ho splintered
into match-sticks, while I soared through the air and landed
twenty feet beyond on my back. That was my first and last
horse of that kind, and since then I have never been the man
who rides a bolter. But you '11 find him at one time or another
in every hunt, and the best advice I can give you is to keep
out of his way.

BUSINESS EXPERIENCES OF THE HON. THOMAS CASH.
BY T. H.
MY special aptitude for business, or, since I have had several,
perhaps I may even say businesses, was not entirely a gift; it
was also largely due to early training. I had spent a great
number of years at school, learning to express myself fluently
in languages of which at least one has yielded several distinct
words to the vernacular of the money market; and with great
prudence I had early obtained a ;special exemption from the
study of mathematics and French and German, that I might
have more hours to devote to d£schylean tragedy and Aris-
totle's Poetics. I had then passed four years at Oxford,
devoting the first two to perfecting my knowledge of the same
subjects, and the last two to
forgetting them and speciali-
sing in—if my memory serves
me—Moral Philosophy. Round-
ing this off with a period of
Roman Law, punctuated by
dinners at an unhealthy hour
in the Temple, usually in the
vicinity of a Hindoo and two
Japanese, I came naturally to
the summit of the long hill of
intellectual preparation, and
with a conquering shout leaped
down the sunny slopes of com-
merce.
I had myself no doubt as to
the suitability of my training;
but it was pleasant to flnd that
it had stamped capacity upon
my countenance so unmistak-
ably. I saw many agents of
many businesses, and in no
single instance did any one of
them fail to recognise at a
glance that the special con-
ditions which had admittedly
handicapped the owner would
be powerless against me. In
cases where meagreness of
profit was attributed to the
proprietor having taken to
gambling, or to drink, or to
photography, it was, of course,
natural that my superiority to
such vices should be apparent
to the most unobservant.
Bat when failure was openly
attributed to mismanagement,

an energetic man. I was simply appalled at the lethargy which
had settled down on the commercial classes. Energy, as I
often used to remark to PEPLOW, as he punted me up the
Cherwell, is at the root of all success, and I frequently pointed
out to him that it was only when he relaxed his efforts that we
ever failed to reach Parsons' Pleasure. And here, in various
forms, were Dr. JOHNSON'S potentialities of wealth beyond the
dreams of avarice simply spoiling through the indolence of
traders. It was a saddening reflection, and I mentally resolved
that the mercantile world should be raised by my example from
this slough of indolence, that it should learn to see in me the
Apostle of Effort, and that I would never fall away for one
moment from that noble ambition, even though I had to have
two managers to do the work and sank under the strain of
paying them. •"
I think it was GUNTER'S ad-
vice that ultimately decided
me to choose brewing for my
first field of operations. He
said that Hereditary Incom-
petence had so long used this
industry as a training ground
for recruits, that to enter it had
become a kind of baronial goose-
step, and any intellect which
really marched could not fail
to achieve distinction. PEP-
LOW'S statement that he had
heard beer took a week to
ferment, during which time
one could only look at it, cer-
tainly weighed with me, for 1
know the value of such periods
of cerebral incubation; but I
was young then, and too pro-
digal of energy to attach full
importance to this considera-
tion. At any rate, I decided
upon brewing, and consulted
Messrs. PINTK ami PUETA on
the subject.
These gentlemen had provi-
dentially the very thing. The
profits were practically non-
existent, but there were rea-
sons. Their account was a
little confused, for we cannot
all have University lucidity of
expression; but, so far as I

of a property for me than otherwise, I began to understand To an energetic man, however, this concern was a sure fortune.
how much my education had effected.
These experiences grew increasingly gratifying. In one
concern, for instance, even general bad trade was similarly
GUNTER and PEPLOW agreed that it offered a fair field for the
display of my talents.
Some little time was taken up by valuations. A tall gentle-
treated as a detail which, although fatal in tho past, and j man, nominated by Messrs. PINTE and PUETA, and a short
possibly in itself deplorable, need not in my case affect the
consideration of the price; but this seemed to me little removed
from flattery. I think—in fact, I feel sure—that tho mere
presence in a neighbourhood of one properly trained commercial
intellect would not affect its entire economic conditions;
unless, indeed—but no, probably even Oxford intelligences have
their limitation.
This was in the year—well, I need not perhaps mention the
date. Anyone who has ever at any time looked for a business
will be able to identify it for himself when I say that it was in
gentleman nominated by myself, spent three days in elaborately
avoiding one another in the neighbourhood, dined together on
the evening of the third day, and on the morning of tho fourth
informed me that the long gentleman's valuation amounted to
£50,000 6s. 8d., and the short gentleman's to £49,999 13s. 4<1.;
they therefore proposed, with my consent, to agree to the figure
at £50,000. This was very fortunately tho sum which I had
told Messrs. PlNTE and PEUTA I desired to invest. I am not a
mathematician myself, but I consulted GUNTER, who was a
Wrangler in his time, and he said the precision of these figures
the year when all tho concerns on offer were a sure fortune to I impressed him very favourably.

(MARCH 20, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVAHI.
The legal formalities and the engagement of a manager caused
some further delay, under which I chafed considerably, but
everything was at last completed. I celebrated the occasion by
giving a dinner to PEPLOW and GUNTER, which served both to
inaugurate the buckling on of my commercial harness, and also as
a leave-taking to my two friends on my setting out on my annual
holiday. I think we all felt the solemnity of the occasion.
PEPLOW proposed success to the New Era in a speech of great
power, and my housemaid, who is from the country, and
happened, at the moment tn be bringing in a decanter, was so
carried away by his dramatic description of the brightness of
the day which he said had dawned, that she turned off the
electric light and plunged us in temporary darkness. GtJNTER,
if less apostrophic, was equally complimentary, and con-
gratulated me on having that day taken a step which would do
more to undermine the drunken habits of the neighbourhood
than the most fanatical temperance crusade.
I returned thanks with, I hope, modesty, deprecating the
idea of sacrifice, for I had made none. To a man of my tempera-
ment the idle lolling on a woolsack, dispensing patronage to
greedy relations, would have been as repugant as, in the
alternative, the somnolent atmosphere of a Bishop's palace.
The so-called learned professions did but deal with the corns
and bunions of the body politic: it was not only from a sense
of duty, but from my own desire, that I had elected to sit rather
with my finger for over on that pulse of trade which throbbed
with the true life-blood of the nation. I said more, but it is
scarcely worth recalling, for I.am conscious my eloquence was
heavy; a sense of coming responsibility robbed it of its usual
light touch. Early the next morning I started for Yokohama.
If I had known then as much as I do now I should have
hesitated to go so far, but my knowledge of managers was at
that time singularly incomplete. Even to this day their short-
comings amaze me, for that absence of strenuous endeavour
which distinguishes the hireling is a characteristic to which I
can never get accustomed. I have no doubt that the reports on
which I had insisted, and which followed me about from place
to place, may have indicated an unsatisfactory state of things,
but they were so shrouded in technical obscurities, and reached
me so long after despatch, that they did not seem worth the
labour of perusal, and it therefore came upon me as a shock in
receive a telegram from PEPLOW advising me to come home and
look into matters. I was relieved to find on my return that
there was nothing, so to speak, organically wrong. I think
PBI LOW, if he had been willing to do as I would have done in his
place, might have remedied matters instead of cabling for me,
but he has a lethargic nature and undoubtedly there had been
an unaccountable lack of supervision.
I took the matter in hand with my usual promptitude. I inter-
viewed my manager, and after impressing upon him the
criminality of slackness in any affair where a hand has once
been put to the plough I discharged him forthwith. I gave
PEPLOW a chance of redeeming the fault against friendship
which he had committed, by offering him the occupation of my
office whilst I looked for a fresh manager, and I made it my
business to weigh the answers to the advertisement I inserted
in the trade journal.
In this manner I soon had matters in a satisfactory condition,
and MACDONALD, the first applicant, installed. He was a
lean and angular Scotchman, lurking behind cheek-bones and a
colossal self-satisfaction, a quality I particularly detest. But
procrastination was never one of my faults, and as MACIK>NALD
applied first, and there were twenty-seven other candidates
whose examination would have taken time, I acted instead of
talking and engaged him there and then. In the week that
PEPLOW had been in my office I could not find that he had done
anything, except order other people about and send the office
boy for bottled beer, so I excused his further attendance and
took possession myself.
It has always seemed to me a blot upon our commercial
system that to all that a principal must necessarily have upon
his mind there should be added the strain of supervision. I
yield to none in energy, but every scientist distinguishes
between the two leading types—energy of motion and energy of
position. Of these, it is the latter which I have developed to
such an extraordinary degree; I have always recognised it as
the highest, and we needs must love the highest when we see
it.
The necessity for this supervision is unfortunate enough when
a principal is upon the spot, but when he is at a distance it is
simply intolerable. MACDONALD had a repellent habit of
chasing me about the country with lists of conundrums requiring
immediate answer, and this in spite of my protests that I could
not possibly return braced for strenuous daily effort if I had to
attend to correspondence whilst recruiting.
Many employers would have refused to be thus worried, and
would have left him to flounder as best he could ; but, making
allowance for a weaker vessel, I used to go through his questions
with great care, and write marginal instructions against each,
such as—
"Consult a solicitor."
"Refer to Mr. PEPLOW, who knows my views."
"Buy tha hops now, unless you can get them cheaper later
on."
"Follow your own judgment, and report to me further."
In spite of this assistance, business did not seem to be
properly dealt with in the office, and at last, on one occasion,
when I returned from a shooting engagement to find my desk
crowded with matters which I had already disposed of as above,
I realised that the time had come for me to administer an object-
lesson.

EVERYONE roust feel the greatest

and who is subjected to the plainest out-
spoken criticism in the newspapers, which
le may be sure is read with the keenest
nterest by friends, foes, and the public
generally. Such is the fate of any college
man of Oxford or Cambridge who becomes
one of "the Eight" of his University.
Study the minutely conscientious pro-
fessional criticisms on the unhappy

jaged in practising for the great annual
competition. The Oxford men occasion-
ally "pick up the work rather well";
but in their stroke there is "a lack of
rhythm." Unfortunate "Numbers Three
and Five" (they're no longer men;
they 're only numbers, like convicts)
"swing out of the boat"; and "bow"
;. "bow oar," but this distinction,
such as it is, is better than being merely a
number), "failing to keep time," aids his
confederates in causing "the boat to
roll about." Subsequently (poor souls!)
their "form began to deteriorate," and
this happened not far from the "Craven"
(absit omen!) "Steps." Then, when they
come to an end of their practice, their
"finish" having been "far from good"
(alas!), "the majority of the men were
much distressed." "Much distressed,"
indeed! Nonsense, they must have been
highly delighted. Of course, they would
not so express themselves, and, no doubt,
implored their trainer, with tears in their
eyes, to let them go on practising for
another hour or two. "Distressed!"
>'ot they. Precious glad to get it over and
to retire for their evening meal, limited.
And the Cantabs; what of them?
Why, they were, so to speak, in the samp
boat witli the Oxonians. They did not
"make a particularly good commence-
ment," and "the. finish of the stroke was
clipped." Quite different this from n
"clipping good stroke." Then the mer
"seemed unable to continue their good
form." Wretched galley slaves! Anc
"they didn't keep proper time." One o
them, "Number Four," appeared on this
occasion to be the ghost of himself, as he
"rowed without life "; and not only so
but he "failed to use his slide, ami
generally spoilt the appearance of the
crew." How pleased "Number Four'
must have been when he read this
What wonder if he had chucked the whole

thermometer at fifteen below zero Centigrade. A tumultuous
North-wind, with a kiss of East in it, is blowing straight off the
Baltic, bringing up faint delicious odours of sea-icicles and
frozen Finn. 1 like these better than the smell of hyacinths,
which seems to me too assertive. I often ask myself what
order of mind it is that prefers new spring dresses and a
town-flat to precious solitude and communion with a botanical
dictionary. I open my treasure at random and read: Galan-
tJms, Gale, Oaleobdolon, Oaleopsis, Galingalc, Gardenia, Garlic,
Gastridiitm. I shall send for whole trucks of these and have
them planted in masses all over the carriage-drive. I wish I
were less ignorant about their symptoms, but I cannot trust to
the gardener, whose imagination does not rise above arti-
chokes, which he talks of training up the sun-dial.
"What a lovely solitary February it has been, with the virgin
snow up to the bedroom windows and the crocuses waiting
their time, all snug and warm under their eider-down quilt.
As I look back to the day when I married the Man of "War,
with a cheerful carelessness of consequences, and no guarantee
of a garden at all, and the prospect of his constant company,
I wonder at my temerity. But it has worked out admirably;
and surely there are few women who can enjoy their husband's
absence with such pure delight, and yet tolerate his presence
with such equanimity.
And now ELKANOII FORBKH must needs ask for her girl
ELIZABETH to pay me a visit for the sake of her German. 1
do hope she will not be too exacting and want society and tea-
parties. The only rule of hospitality which I really understand
is the one about speeding the parting guest. However, I hear
she is very innocent and ingenue, and so she ought to be fond
of flowers. She may even have a soul, and be able to talk
about the easier poets.
STH.—Chateau Chasse-Bebe. Dearest Mamma,—I leave here
to-morrow. 1 wish 1 hadn't got to stay with Griilin ELIZABETH.
I know they won't any of them have waists, except the men,
and they eat their food even worse than the French, and can't
say nice things to make up for it. Still, it's time I left here
anyway. Some of the men are so absent-minded, and keep on
proposing to me in the billiard-room (not the English kind, you
know), and whole heaps of the 09th Chanieur* have pinched me
in corridors and places, and I don't think this is quite respect-
ful, do you, Mamma? And it is so awkward, because CELESTIXE
notices the marks on my arms when she is drying mo after my
tub, and this makes her very patronising and hinty, and the
stuffing I put into my bedroom key-hole because of the draught-
keeps falling out, I can't think why. Two duels have been
fought for some reason or other, 1 don't know what, in the
deer-park and one in the middle of a Palli <1e Papier. Nobody
was hurt, of course, but it makes people look awfully sheepish,
and I 'm sure it's time I left. I am picking up some new gowns
from ROSALIE'S to astonish the Fatherland, though I don't know
what the nearest garrison town is or whether they have fleets
and things on the sea there, and goodnight, dear Mamma,
Your aflectionate daughter, ELIZABETH.
STH.—I have hardly had time to discover whether ELIZABETH
has a soul, but her dinner-gown and general attitude do not
encourage this hope. I am a little afraid that she expected a
house-party, or at least an officer or two to take her in. I may
be obliged to send for the Man of War to amuse her. It sounds
improbable, but in his heavy negative way he likes a young
girl without ideas or yearning intelligence.
One thing that struck me as a deplorable revelation of her
character was a remark that slip made about some women who
bored her ("stuffy people," she called them) on one of her
visits ; " nothing," she said, " rustled nicely when they walked,
anil they had 110 scent on." Unfortunately she allows no such
defect in her own toilette, and the scent she " has on " quite
overpowers the pure fragrance of my snowdrops, besides beiug
a detestable thing in itself. 1 even sigh for the Man of "War's
tobacco, and look forward to an afternoon with my artificial
manures as a corrective.
I asked her the usual question at night—" You are not afraid
of sleeping alone?" "Oh, no," she said, "I'm used to ghosts:
there were whole stacks of them at Norman Tower in the
passages, and a funny old thing asked me to join them and he
would take care of me, but 1 thought it would be such shivery
work in the middle of the night." I am afraid ELIZABETH'S
mother is not careful enough in her choice of houses for this
young person to stay in. Girls with such beautifully childlike
minds are often too unsuspecting of evil.
HTH.—SchlossBlumendam. Dearest Mamma,—I can't imagine
why you sent me here. It's been the stuffiest week I ever had.
I 'm the whole house-party in myself, and not a man of any kind
in the place except the coachman who's married and the
gardener who 's engaged to the cook. It 's so depressing, and I
think CKLESTIXE means to go out of her mind. The Grafin only
has two dresses, and talks all day of nothing but flowers and
manures, and have I read any good books lately, and of course
I haven't, and I can't even think of any names to pretend with.
Once I thought something was really going to happen, when
the Grafln said that she was looking forward excitedly to u
whole heap of tens. I should have chosen dances myself, but
teas arc better than nothing, and sometimes you get a straj-
man to look in ; and then it turned out that it was short forlcn-
roxcs. Such dull things to look forward to!
And then, again, I never get really shocked here. Oh, yes,
once I was when the (iriifin said that she hoped that a lot of
Rubenses wouldn't get into Madame JOSEPH SCHWARZ'S lied by
mistake again as they did last year. Of course I guessed that
"Rubenses " were only pictures, but it did seem rather inuddly
for Madamo SCHWAKZ having them actually in her bed, and so
many of them too, besides being very valuable, I should think,
and easily damaged, especially if she is stout like most German
women are. And I wondered if Madame NCHWARZ was a
visitor or just the housekeeper; and when 1 asked if they
weren't taken out at once, the (iriifin said that no, it was tt>o
late and they had to keep them there all the summer as it
wasn't safe to move them. And then 1 asked wasn't it very
uncomfortable for her having to sleep on a crowd of old oils, or
were they only very little ones, and was there room for her in
the other half of. the bed ; and it turned out that it wasn't
pictures, or a visitor, or a housekeeper at all, but just the
names of different dwarf-roses!
Always roses and things! 1 thought I liked flowers till 1
came here, though I was never good at their names and used to
mix up verbenas with scarlet-runners; but after this I know it
will take away my appetite just seeing them on a dinner-table,
and when I die, which I shall do pretty soon if things go on
like this,, I hope they '11 have a notice put in the paper, saying,
"No floivers, please."
I don't wonder the Graf himself keeps away from his wife. I
suppose her parents made him marry her like the poor Marquis
at Chasse-B<5be. I really miss him and the Vicointe, and if
Lord YALKOP was here now I don't believe I should smack him
so hard again, however he behaved, though they were rather
forward, all of them, weren't they, Mamma?
Later.—Great news! The Grafin says vaguely that the Mau-

THE BUREAU OF COMMON-SENSE.
[" Judge EMDEX, of Lambeth County Court, is convinced that nothing is
more required than a bureau to give common-sense advice to the humbler
classes. His Honour had before him a labourer, who earned from 25». to 30«.
a week, and supported a wife and family. He was induced to take a 25-
guinea piano on the hire-purchase system, but could not keep up his monthly
payments."—Daily Paper.]
IT is suggested that, if such a Bureau were established, the
daily report of proceedings might read something after this
fashion:—• WILLIAM JENKiNSOX, bricklayer, applied for advice
under the following circumstances. His wife had been kept
awake by neuralgia for two nights in succession. Should he
call in Sir DOUGLAS POWELL, or would a change of air be likely
to relieve her sufferings:1 In the latter case, he was uncertain
whether to take her to tho South of France or for a long sca-
•oyage. Perhaps the authorities would kindly givo him the
names of some llrst-class hotels in the Riviera. He was earning
regular wages of 18s. a week.
ROBERT JONES, dustman, was anxious to know whether he
would be considered extravagant if he indulged his taste for
Art by attending at CHRISTIE'S in his spare time and bidding
forOld Masters. He already possessed at his private1 residence,
in Clare Market, a line specimen of VELASQUEZ and an undis-
puted TITIAN. There was a little thing by TINTORETTO that he
was particularly anxious to secure. He was in receipt of 15s.
a week from the Vestry, but a good many of the householders
were in the habit of giving him twopence for himself when he
cleared their dust-bins.
JIM HOPKINS, railway porter, wanted to be told what was the
largest amount, consistent with true economy, that a person in
his position might spend annually on opera tickets. He made
16s. a week and tips extra. Also, which was the best place to
take a lady to for supper. He had heard that the cooking was
good both at the Carlton and the Savoy.
THOMAS SIMPSON was earning 14s. weekly as a 'bus conductor.
His working hours being rather long, he had little time to
himself, but his great hobby was book collecting. He possessed
tho first four folios of SHAKESPEARE complete, and most of the
quartos. There was, however, room in his library in the Mile
End Road for some, more volumes. Did tho Bureau authorities
think him justified in buying a beautiful edition of the Encyclo-
paedia Britannica, bound in vellum, or would he bo acting more
wisely in subscribing for the Time* issue of tho First Fifty
Yearn o/ Punch.
JosEl'H TIMMS, office-boy, was quite aware that you cannot
judge cigars by tho picture on tho box. He was unable to
make up his mind whether " La Rosa Do Santiago " Celestialos,
at 102s. the hundred, were preferable to "H. Do Cabanas Y
Carbajal " Imperiales at 84s. Of course, if the Bureau advised
him to go in for a cheaper cigar, "HENRY CLAYS " at 51s. were
not bad. His salary was 7s. Ot(. a week, but he expected to
have a rise soon.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DRAMATIC PROLOGUE.
THE UNFORTUNATE MR. EBBSMITH.
THOSE persons -who have seen Mrs.
PATRICK CAMPBELL'S magnificent perform-
ance at the Royalty in The Notorious
Mrs. Ebbsmith will have probably gone
away -with a quite false impression of
the gentleman with whom AGNES EBB-
SMITH spent her eight years of married
life. "For the first twelve months," she
declares bitterly in the first act, "he
treated me like a woman in a harem, for
the rest of the time like a beast of
burden." This is not quite just to poor
EBBSMITH, who was a good sort of fellow
in his commonplace way, and it is mani-
festly unfair that the audience should
have no opportunity of hearing his side
of the question. An attempt is made to
remedy this injustice in the following
Prologue, which all fair-minded persons
are entreated to read before seeing Mr.
PINERO'S very clever play.
SCENE— The dining-room of the EBBSMITHS'
/louse in West Kensington. AGNES and
her Husband are at breakfast. They
have been married seven years. She
looks much as we see her in the early
acts of the play, gaunt, pale, badly
dressed. He is a careworn man with
hair slightly grey at the temples, an
anxious forehead and sad eyes. He
is glancing through the Standard in
the intervals of eating his bacon. She is
absorbed in the Morning Screamer,
one of the more violent Socialist -
Radical organs of that day. Presently,
EBBSMITH looks up.
Ebbsmith. You won't forget, AGNES, that
we are expecting people to dinner to-
night?
Agnes (putting down her paper with an
air of patient endurance). Eh?
Ebbsmith (mildly). I was saying, dear,
if you will give me your attention for a
moment, that I hoped you would not forget
that Sir MYLES JAWKINS and his wife and
the SPENCERS and the THORNTONS were
dining here to-night.
Agnes (contemptuously). You seem very
anxious that 1 should remember that
Lady JAWKINS is honouring us with her
company!
Ebbsmith. I only meant that I hoped
you had told JANE about dinner. Last time
the JAWKINSES came you may recollect
that you had omitted to order anything
for them to eat, and when they arrived
there was nothing in the house but some
soup, a little cold mutton and a rice
pudding.
Agnes. Very well (returns to her paper).
Ebbsmith. Thank you. And, ACNES, if
you could manage to be dressed in time to
receive them I should be very much
obliged.
Agnes. I?
Ebbsmith. Of course. I suppose you will
be here to entertain our guests.
Agnes. Your guests, you mean.
Ebbsmith. My dear AGNES, surely my
guests are your guests also!
Agnes (breaking out). As long as the
present unjust and oppressive marriage
laws remain in force-—•
Ebbsmith (interrupting). I don't think
we need go into the question of the
alteration of the marriage laws.
Agnes. Ah, yes. You always refuse to
listen to my arguments on that subject.
Yon know they are unanswerable.
Ebbsmith (patiently). I only meant that
there would hardly be time to argue the
matter at breakfast.
Agne» (vehemently). A paltry evasion!
Ebbsmith. Still, 1 assume that you will
be here to receive our guests—my guests
if you prefer it—to-night.
Agnes. Do you make a point of always
being at home to receive my guests?
Ebbsmith. Those Anarchist people whom
you are constantly asking to tea? Cer-
tainly not.
Agnes (with triumphant logic). Then,
may I ask, why I should be at home to
receive the JAWKINSES?
Ebbsmith. My dear, you surely realise
that the cases are hardly parallel. The
only time I was present at one of your
Revolutionary tea - parties the guests
consisted of a Hyde Park orator who
dropped his h's, a cobbler who had
turned Socialist by way of increasing his
importance in the eyes of the community,
three ladies who were either living apart
from their husbands or living with the
husbands of other ladies, and a Polish
refugee who had been convicted, quite
justly, of murder. You cannot pretend
to compare the JAWKINSES with such
people.
Agnes. Indeed, I can. (Rhetorically) In
a properly organized Society
Ebbsmith (testily). I really can't stop to
re-organize Society now. I am due at
my chambers in half-an-hour.
Agnes (sullenly). As you decline to listen
to what I have to say, I may as well tell
you at once that I shall not be at home to
dinner to-night.
Ebbsmith (controlling hi* temper with an
effort). May I ask your reason?
Agnes. Because I have to be at the
meeting of the Anti-marriage Association.
Ebbsmith. Can't you send an excuse?
Agnes. Send an excuse I Throw up a
meeting called to discuss an important
Public question because you have asked a
few barristers and their wives to dine!
You must be mad.
Ebbsmith. Well, I must put them off, I
suppose. What night next week will suit
you to meet them? Thursday?
Agnes. On Thursday I am addressing a
meeting of the Society for the Encourage-
ment of Divorce.
Ebbsmith. Friday?
Agnes (coldly). Friday, as you know, is
the weekly meeting of the Agamists*
League.
Ebbsmith. Saturday?
Agnes. On Saturday I am speaking on
Free Union for the People at Battersea.
Ebbsmith. Can you suggest an evening?
Agnes (firmly). No. I think the time has
come to make a stand against the con-
vention which demands that a wife should
preside at her husband's dinner-parties.
It is an absurdity. Away with it!
Ebbsmith (alarmed). But, AGNES! Think
what you are doing. You don't want to
offend these people. SPENCER and THORNTON
are useful men to know, and JAWKINS puts
a lot of work in my way.
Agnes (with magnificent scorn). How like
a man! And so .' am to be civil to this
JAWKINS person because he "puts a lot
of work in your way!"
Ebbsmith (meekly). Well, you know, my
dear, I have to make an income somehow.
Agnes. 1 would sooner starve than resort
to such truckling!
Ebbsmith (gloomily). We are likely to do
that, sooner or later, in any case.
-4gnes. What do you mean?
Ebbsmith (dtjjldently). Your—ahem !—
somewhat subversive tenets, my love, arc
not precisely calculated to improve my
professional prospects.
Agnf.s. What have I to do with your
prospects?
Ebbsmith. The accounts of your meet-
ings which appear in the newspapers
are not likely to encourage respectable
solicitors to send me briefs.
Agnes (indifferently). Indeed!
Ebbsmith. Here is a report in to-day's
Standard of a meeting addressed by you
last night which would certainly not have
that effect. Shall I read it to you?
Agnes. If you wish it.
Ebbsmith (reads). "The meeting which
was held in St. Luke's parish last night
under the auspices of the Polyandrous
Club proved to be of an unusually excit-
ing description. The lecturer was Mrs.
JOHN EBBSMITH, wife of the well-known
barrister of that name." Really, AGNES,
I think my name need not have been
dragged into the business.
Agnes. Go on.
Ebbsmith. "As soon as the doors were
opened the place of meeting—the Iron
Hall, Carter Street —was filled with a
compact body of roughs assembled from
the neighbouring streets, and there seemed
every prospect of disorderly scenes. Tho
appearance of Mrs. EBBSMITH on the plat-
form was greeted with cries of 'Mad
AGNES!'" Surely, my dear, you must
recognise that my professional reputation
is endangered when my wife is reported
in the newspapers to bo addressing
meetings in discreditable parts of London,
where her appearance is greeted with
shouts of ' Mad AGNES !'"

Agnes. Nonsense! Who is likely to read
an obscure paragraph like that?
Ebbsmith. Obscure paragraph! My dear
AGNES, the Standard has a leading article
on it. Listen to this:—" Mrs. EBBSMITH'S
crusade against the institution of marriage
is again attracting unfavourable attention.
Last night in St. Luke's she once more
attempted to ventilate her preposterous
schemes . . . crack-brained crusade . . .
bellowing revolutionary nonsense on ob-
scure platforms . . . This absurd visionary,
•whom her audiences not inappropriately
nickname 'Mad AONIS' . . . TJltimately
the meeting had to be broken up by the
police . . . We cannot understand how a
man in Mr. EBBSMITH'S position can allow
himself to Be made ridiculous." (Almost
ti'eeping) I do think they might leave my
name out of it. In a leading article too!
.Agues. Is there any more of the stuff?
Ebbsmith. Another half column. Do, my
dear, to oblige me, find some less osten-
tatious method of making known your
views on the subject of marriage1.
Agnes (anticipating a remark xnhseqiieiitly
made by the Duke of ST. OLPHERTS). ;Un-
ostentatious immodesty is not part of my
programme.
Ebbsmith (humbly). Could you not, for
my sake, consent to take a less prominent
part in the movement?
Agnes (enthusiastically). But I want to
be among the Leaders—the Leaders! That
will be my hour
Ebbsmith (puzzled). Your hour? I doa'b
think I quite understand you.
Agnes. There's only one hour in a
woman's life—when she's defying her
husband, wrecking his happiness and
blasting his prospects. That is her hour!
Let her make the most of every second
of it!
Ebbsmitli (wearily). Well, my dear, when
it's over, you '11 have the satisfaction of
counting the departing footsteps of a
ruined man.
Agnes. Departing?
Ebbsmith. Certainly. You and your
crusade between them will have killed me.
But I must go now. I ought to be at my
chambers in ten minutes, and I must go
round and make my excuses to JAWKINS
some time this morning. Tell-jANE not to
bother about dinner to-night. I shall dine
at the Club.

YENEZIA LA BELLA.
[According to a correspondent of the Times, it is
proposed to erect bridges connecting Venice with
the mainland.]
ONE afternoon in the autumn of 1930,
when the express from Milan arrived at
Venice an Englishman stepped out, handed
his luggage ticket to a porter, and said,
"Hotel Tiziano."
"Adesso Hotel Moderno, signore,"
remarked the porter.
"They 'vo changed the name, I suppose.
All right. Hotel Moderno, gondola."
"Clie cosa, signore ?" asked the porter,
apparently confused, "gon—, gondo—, non
capisco. Hotel Moderno, non e vero?"
And he led the way to the outside, where
the Englishman perceived a wide,
asphalted street. "£cco Id, signore, la
stazione sotterranea del Tubo dei Qtiattro
Soldi: ecco qui Iti tramvla elettrica, e
{'omnibus de!I' hotel."
"Gondola," repeated the Englishman.
The porter stared at him again. Then he
shookhishead andanswered, "A'oncapisco,
Hore, non parlo inglese." So the
Englishman entered the motor omnibus,
started at once, for there were no other
travellers, and in a few minutes arrived
at the hotel, designed by an American
architect and fifteen stories in height.
The gorgeous marble and alabaster
entrance-hall was entirely deserted.
Having engaged a room, the Englishman
asked -for a guide. The hall porter, who
spoke ten languages fluently and simul-
taneously, murmured some words into a
telephone, and almost immediately a
dapper little man presented himself with
an obsequious bow. .
"I want to go round the principal
buildings," said the Englishman. "You
speak English, of course."
'' Secure, Sir,'' answered the guide, with
another bow; "alls the ciceronians speaks
her fine language, but her speak I as one
English. Lets us go to visit the Grand
Central Station of the Tube."
"Oh, no," said the Englishman, "not
that sort of thing! I 'm not an engineer.
I should like to see the Doge's Palace."
"Lo, Sir! The Palace is now the
Stazione Cent rale Elettrica."
"Then it's no good going to see that.
I will go to St. Marks."
"San Marco is shutted, Sir. The vtbra-
zione of the elettrical mechanism has done
fall the mosaics. The to visit is become
too periculous."
"Oh, indeed! Well, we can go up the
Grand Canal."
"The Canal Grande, Sir, is now the
Via Marconi. Is all changed, and covered,
as all the olds canals of Venezia, with
arches of steel and a street of asfalto.
Is fine, fine, e bella, bella, una via mara-
I'iyliosa!"
"You don't mean to say there isn't a
canal left? Where are the gondolas
then?"
"Ah, tina gondola! The sir is archeo-
logo. Ebbenel We shalls go to the Museo.
There she shall see one gondola, much
curious, and old, ah, so old!"
"Not a canal, not a gondola—except in
the museum! What is there to see?"
"There is much, Sir. There is the
Tube of the Pour Halfpennies, tutto a!J'
inglese, as at London. He is on the
arches of steel below the news streets.
There is the bridge from the city to
Murano, one span of steel all covered of
stone much thin, as the Ponte della Torre,
the Bridge of the Tower, at London. Is
marvellous, the our bridge! Is one
bridge, and not of less not appear to be
one bridge, but one castle of the middle
age in the middle air. $: bellissimo, e
oncJie tutto all' inglese. And then"
"Stop," cried the Englishman. "Does
anybody ever come to your city now?
Any artists, for instance?"
"Ah, no, Sir! Pittori, seultori, perchef
But there are voyagers some time. The
month past all the Society of the Engineers
of Japan are corned, and the hotels were
fulls, and all those sirs were much con-
tenteds and saved the city was marvel-
lous. She shall go now, Sir. to visit the
bridge?"
"No," said the Englishman, emphati-
cally, "not I! Let me pay my bill here
and your fee, whatever it is, and take me
back to the railway station as fast as
you can. There arc plenty of bridges in
London. I am going back there."

IN OTHER DAYS LET OTHER LIPS."
NOT mine to tell in splendid verse
My Lady's beauty, nor to greet her
With joyous music, nor rehearse
Her virtue in melodious metre.
Not mine to liken her dear eyes
To something shy and unexpected
In metaphor that would surprise
The poets who are most respected.
Not mine to weave her fancy prose
With all a laureate's graceful notion,
Nor glad her sight with rows on rows
Of printed, edited emotion.
Not mine—an undiscovered KEATS,
My genius has escaped detection,
And everything I proffer meets
With editorial rejection.

NATIONAL.
HONOURED SIR,—Reading in the Daily
Telegraph that spring had arrived (though,
sooth to say, I would humbly suggest that
the Discovery need not seek the South
Pole if the Promoters of the Expedition
desire Antarctic sensations), I plucked
up courage to run through the candidates
about to compete for the Timber and
Ditch Derby. My prognostications are
brief but, I trust, to the point.—point-to-
point, in fact.
There are many, who back the Go to meet Hack,
But I prefer Glory of might-debt;
Hit of Gotsip may win, but I like for the spin
The Lotion of Slough if well set.
Trusting, honoured Sir, that You and
Yours will be well to the fore as usual,
I am, as heretofore,
Your devoted Henchman,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Princes and Poisoners (DUCKWORTH) is the attractive title
fiven to a translation of Monsieur FuNCK-BRENTANO's studies of
he Court of Louis XIV. These studies are, perhaps, a little
monotonously confined to the occupation of secret murder. As
he industrious author is able to give chapter and verse from
official documents for his weird stories we must accept them as
matters of fact. They reveal a state of things in the daily life
f Paris during the reign of the Grand Monarque, contemplation
f which lends a new reading to the cherished phrase about the
good old times. If a woman in any rank of life, from a washer-
voinan to a marchioness, grew a-weary of her husband, she just
oisoned him and borrowed another, who, in all probability,
ventually shared the same fate. It is noteworthy that the
hief movers in this domestic drama, from the sorceress LA
'OISIN to the great practitioner the Countess de BUIXVILLIKR.H,
•ere women. The story of the latter has often been told,
ever in fuller or more authentic detail than in this narrative.
or perfectly harmless people like my Bnronite it has a
orrible fascination. Beer-drinkers in the neighbourhood of

by the Editor, Mr. POTTER BRISCOE, who contributes an intro-

TIME was when the High to the feminine eye
Was a shrine of mysterious rites,
Where studious youth sat worshipping Truth
Through long and laborious nights;
And woman still trod each garden and quad.
With a fearful delight as she ran,
While a halo of gold she was apt to behold
Round the cap of the 'Varsity man.
At the letters B.A. she was filled with dismay,
Such learning they seemed to imply—
Which fact followed from the principle om-
me ignotum pro terribili.
A Master of Arts was a master of hearts,
Who worshipping crowds never lacked,
For the graduate dunce was a magnate at once
And as such he was bound to attract.
But the lustre that fell, like a magical spell,
O'er our halls we can only deplore,
And the glory once shed round the graduate's head
Now shines on our faces no more.
For the girls swarming by, down the Corn and the High,
Have invaded each college and shrine,
With the tragic result they've abandoned our cult,
And think us no longer divine.
To boast a B.A. is now a poor way
To give weight to our masculine words,
For these maidens of course know precisely the force
Of our Firsts and our Seconds and Thirds.
A don in their eyes is not bound to be wise,
Nor a graduate always a god :
'Neath the pelt leonine a poor ass they divine—
Our glory is gone. Ichabod 1
THE GART00NS OF SIR JAGKIDES THE INIMITABLE.
(Selected from Mr. Punch's Pages and published at the
“Punch" Office.)
OLD friends, indeed, and to not a few of us somewhere in the
sere and yellow, old familiar faces too ! What memories does
not this carefully compiled collection of Sir John's famous
cartoons, from 1851 to 1901, awaken The Russian Bear and
the Bees the British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger
What pages of history are here summed up in such a
manner that the busiest or the most careless among the
younger ones may learn them in a few moments, and the
least impressionable will carry away with them the lasting
remembrance of the powerful pictures that at the time
recorded these events and emphasized their moral. What real
lions ! what fierce tigers what wonderful bears, dancing,
piping, or hugging.
There is one very striking scene representing Lord RANdolph
CHURCHILL when, in 1886, as the Grand Young Man he took the
House by storm. Behind him stands the watchful shade of
DISRAELI, saying, “Dear me ! Quite reminds me of old times' "
And now, in this year of grace, 1901, has not Mr. Punch's
Parliamentary artist quite recently reminded the public of this
very cartoon by showing, in a small sketch, WINSTON CHURCHILL
in his father's attitude, repeating his father's tour de force,
while behind him is the shade of Lord RANdolph, in the attitude
of DISRAELI's ghost, repeating these identical words? Of course,
the allusion to Sir John's “DISRAELI picture” was taken at once
and thoroughly appreciated.
What humour in “The Panic among the Pigs,” when a Papal
Rescript condemned “The Plan of Campaign” and scattered
the Irish Nationalists! What pathos in that wonderful
“Dropping the Pilot,” of which the original is in Lord
ROSEBERY's possession. What genuine fun and humour in the
two old maids, H-RC-RT and M-RL-Y, under the mistletoe,
December, 1898 :
One of Sir John's most remarkable triumphs—he is always
immense when humanizing animals—is in his conception of the
Chinese Dragon (1900) about to receive its death-blow from the
spear of civilisation. It is only when calling to mind the comic
pantomimic effects of the droll fairy legends, with which the
figure of the Dragon has always been pictorially assoicated, that
the thoughtful critic will realise the great difficulty that had to
be encountered by any artist determined to deal seriously
with a dragon, and to give us such a monster as would cause
rather a thrill of terror than raise even the slightest smile.
WAGNER and his property men signally failed with their dragon
on the operatic stage: c’était pour rire. But TENNIEL's Dragon
is fearfully and wonderfully made. Sir John has compelled the
grotesque to become very real and living. Yes, it is Sir John
himself who is the knight that has conquered the Dragon.
In his cartoon of “ Gladiators preparing for the Arena "–a
veritable triumph of wit and humour displayed in perfect artis-
tic design and consummate draughtsmanship, unsurpassed, I may
venture to affirm, by any cartoon of a similar character that
Sir JOHN has ever done—the names of the political celebrities
therein pourtrayed are clearly set forth below, so that future
generations, to whom the living presentments of “Lord JoHN,”
RoeBUck, HoRSMAN, T. HUghes, MILL, Lowe, GLADSTONE, Lord
DERBY, B. DISRAELI and JOHN BRIGHT would be unfamiliar or
absolutely unknown, are thus enabled to identify each celebrity.
It would have added considerably to the historic value of this
admirable collection had this plan been adopted throughout.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—It is announced that

cluding " elaborate precautions to ensure
that, as far as possible, not a single house
or a single individual shall be overlooked."
I protest, Sir, against the overlooking.
1 am already overlooked by countless tax-
gatherers, why, then, should the Regis-
trar-General put his detectives on my
track? Of what interest can it be to him
to know my age, or my social position, or
the number of the house in which I reside?
If the Registrar-General would put on a
staff of officials to note the late arrivals of
the trains at Metropolitan stations, he
would confer a possible blessing on
travelling humanity. As it is, he is driving
sensible beings to foreign dog-kennels and
Continental rabbit-hutches.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAKT or TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 18.—
Somebody, I forget who, once "poured
contumely and scorn " on somebody else
whose name at the moment I forget. DON
JOSE nicely discriminates. To-night he
poured scorn on Mr. LOUGH; heaped con-
tumely on SYDNEY BUXTON. All about
Ashanti. A new quarter of the African
continent for M.P.'s to take their pleasure
in. Identical in one respect with South
Africa. In West Africa as in the South, a
baleful influence predominates. The
Ashantis, as DON Jos6 pictured them,
sarcastically drawing on the fancy of
Mr. LOUGH, were enjoying condition1 of
Klysian happiness; the day too short for
natives engaged in peaceful pursuits.
fellow countrymen arc cruel, treacherous, j
thieves and murderers; all at expense ot 1
blameless natives.
DON Jost almost sorry for Mr. LOUGH.
With SYDNEY BUXION the case different.
He had been at the Colonial Office;
must know something of the real state
of things in Ashanti, of the difficulties
and dangers with which the Colonial
Office had to wrestle. These, in aug-
mented measure, were inherited by the
present Colonial Minister from his pre-
decessors. Here followed withering de-
nunciation of a Government which, whilst
the scramble for Africa went on, did
nothing, the result being that British
Colonies were encroached upon, their value
destroyed by the advance of other nations.
Drawing towards midnight when DON
JOSE rose. A weary sitting; wrangling
Tuesday night.—"Tuppence more and
up goes the donkey!'' Thus REDMOND
afn<5, in correspondence with convenient
persons in the United States and in
speeches at St. Patrick Day's banquets.
Of course doesn't use the classic phrase.
t What he says, ore rotondo, is that he and
his more or less merry men, facing tyrau-
, nical Government with majority of 100,
have in course of four short weeks reduced
House of Commons to absurdity, over-
i whelmed Government with difficulty and
embarrassment. Tuppence more in the
hat, and patriotic Irishmen shall see what
they shall see.
Speech and letters characteristically
bombastic; substratum of truth under-
lies assertion. House to-night, as it was
last night, in pitiable condition regarded
from business point of \iew; progress

SOMS ''FETISHES" NOT WORSHIPPED BY KINO Jo-Jo OF ASHANTI (AND KLSEWHIRK).
On this pleasing picture falls the baneful
shadow of the COLONIAL SECRETARY. All
is changed; war succeeds peace; discord
follows harmony; the sword of the
executioner is looted, and oke tho Golden
Stool is withdrawn from beneath the
sacred person of the KING.
"These things follow," said DON Jostf,
looking round with penitential glance,
"on the advent of the Bogey Man from the
Colonial Office."
This pretty overture prelude to some-
thing resembling an Ashanti foray. Dis-
tinction between his two assailants
cleverly, effectively marked. For the
ignorance of Mr. LOUGH he had no feeling
but one of infinite pity. Member for
Islington knew nothing about Ashanti, or
of the relations of the Colonial Office with
it. Suffering from flux of talk, he must
needs pour it forth whenever opportunity
presented itself; the vote for Ashanti
coming up for discussion, it served him as
well as any other topic offering means
of relief; also he had cherished oppor-
tunity of showing that on the West Coast
of Africa, as in its Southern parts, his
about procedure up to eight o'clock, when
business was commenced with a statement
extending through the dinner hour ex-
planatory of Naval Estimates; then Mr.
LOCGH; next SYDNEY BUXTON, trying to
walk on both sides of the road at the
same time; then DON Jostf, in ominously
smiling mood to begin with. Hasn't en-
joyed himself so much for a long time;
delight of defence of policy in South
Africa palled by repetition; Ashanti new
ground; Opposition been nibbling at it
for some time ; questions suggesting exis-
tence of state of things Mr. Loi'Gll'S
fancy feigned have appeared on Paper.
This the first full opportunity presented.
DON Josti seized it by the hair, as they
say in Franco. Metaphorically, as far as
circumstances permit, he also took by
the hair the Member for Islington and
the Member for Tower Hamlets, banging
their heads together by way of cadence
to his fiery speech, much as in other
climes the dancer beats time with cym-
bals held in either hand.
Business done.—Naval Estimates intro-
duced.
with Votes slow and spasmodic. When
one is submitted, reduction moved; long
speech made; Minister in charge replies.
If, as chances just now, tho Minister be
DON JOSE, Members on other side rise up
and call him wicked. PRINCE ARTHUR
after given interval glides in, moves the
closure; two divisions, between them
occupying half an-hour, are taken. Another.
Vote submitted; performance repeated.
To-night new Member varied procedure
by denouncing eminent City firm as a
common gang of thieves and swindlers.
"Let me at them," he exclaimed. "Don't
hold me back! Nothing I desire more
than that they should bring against me
charge of libel. But they won't. Police!
Thieves! Swindlers!"
DON Jos£ obligingly pointed out that
new Member could readily obtain his
heart's desire. Let him place in writing
what he has just said, publish it out of
doors, and he would swiftly find himself
defendant in action for criminal libel.
New Member glared at Colonial Secretary.
"The right hon. gentleman," he said,
"makes black white and white black.

"ho once- slandered the soldiers of the
Empire, the attack being based on anony-
mous correspondence."
'What is to "bo done with now Member
of this kind? J. "W. LowTOEii regarded
him curiously from the chair; called him
to order several times; with difficulty
induced to resume his seat whilst Chair-
mah on his feet. Got up again; broke
out in fresh place.
"I have," he said, slowly waving a
pamphlet, "a document in my hand that

ex-blockade runner. Ever since he came
to Westminster has taken up his parable
against the Belleville boiler. Boiler now
bust; millions having been spent on it
by successive administrations, committee
of experts declare money wasted. Boiler
not to be used any more in British Navy.
But it /iris been used; all big battleships
built in recent years have the Belleville
boiler. What's to be done about them?
is anxiously asked.
"WThy, then," answers DOGBERRY (who
sat on the Commission), "take 'no note
of him, but let him go, and presently call
the rest of the watch together and thank
Ciod you are rid of great peril."
WILLI\M ALLAN, not satisfied with this
shiftless proceeding, ruffles his hair,
tangles his beard, draws himself up an
inch or two above his superfluous six
feet, and hails the Treasury Bench as if
it were moored on the other side of the
Thames. They must root out these boilers
from every ship, beginning with the
Royal Yacht.
. "Come down like a man," he thundered
at ARNOLD FORSTER, pale and trembling
on the deserted Bench. "Frankly ad-
mit that the Department have made a
colossal and costly mistake. Don't allow
your amour propre to stand in the way."
"Armour prope," he called it, suggest-
ing a new type of water-tube boiler.
Business done.—Talked away on divers
subjects till midnight, when, settling
down to work, took a few Votes and
several divisions in report of Supply.
Friday night. — In Lords the other
night F.-M. WoLSELEY lifted veil from
inner sanctum of War Office, and dis-
closed SECRETARY OP STATE and Comman-
der-in-chief lighting each other instead
of the Boer. RAGLAN interposed with
testimony that so far from the two noble
Lords avoiding each other's society, they
were in the habit of seeking it with a
persistence embarrassing to the Under
Secretary. His room lying between those
of the two chiefs, ho was constantly
interrupted by them flying through in
search of each other's counsel.
SARK tells me that whilst this story is
true it is not complete. When the SECRE-
TARY OF STATE rushed across to call upon
his esteemed friend and colleague, lie found
the Commander-in-Chief had just rushed
out to call on him; and Vice Versa, as Mr.
ANSTEV says. Thus, like parallel lines,
they never met.

colleague. Much angry talk about yester-
day's performance in the Lords. FOREIGN
SECRETARY, in pursuance of friendly
arrangement with EARL SPENCER, made
full communication about crisis at
Tientsin. An hour later FIRST LORD OF
TREASURY invited to make statement on
subject to anxious Commons.
"Story! God bless you," cried PRINCE
ARTHCR, in his astonishment looking
curiously like a needy knife-grinder, "I
have none to tell."
Members persisted. FOREIGN SECRE-
TARY had been unreservedly communica-
tive in other House, why should the
Commons be kept in the dark on question
of momentous importance?
"WThat communication?" PniNCB
ARTHUR asked, in evident bewilderment.

ponder on strange ways of a Government

A FLEET IN SEEMING.
(Showing the folly of wasting money on

THE gentlemen were elderly,
The gentlemen were wise,
And yet they stared in wonder :\t
The sights that met their eyes.
The Board of Admiralty they
Had planned a little trip
To ascertain the value of
A modern battle ship.
The ship lay snugly in the dock,
And so with cue accord
The elderly wise gentlemen
Came presently on board.
They gazed in rapture at her bulk,
Her armour-plated sides,
Admitting that shipbuilding had
Made certainly great strides.
They peered into her turrets grim,
Her horrid guns they eyed,
And each the foremost Naval Power
In playful jest defied.
They clambered up, they tumbled
down,
They trapsed from bow to stern,
The finest new equipment they
Beheld at every turn.
They worked a gun, the search-light
proved,
The signalling inspected,
And joyed to think what credit it
Upon themselves reflected.
But as they were about to leave
The warship for the shore,
They recollected they had missed
The ammunition store.
They called the officer in charge,
Their wish to him expressed,
And asked, in bygone phrase, to see
The ammunition chest.
The officer by shoulder-shrug
Its absence indicated,
And said, " Our ammunition, Sirs,
Is not yet fabricated."
The elderly wise gentlemen
Looked each the other at
In ill-concealed astonishment,
And murmured, "Fancy that!"
"But if," said one, " in action you
Were sent against the foe,
It surely would be safer to—
Load up a gun or so?"
The officer replied: "If we
Were into action sent, Sirs,
All moneys on projectiles would
Be very idly spent, Sirs,
For Naval experts all agree
Wo should not need a shot there,
For all our boilers would explode
Long, long before we got there.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE EVOLUTION OF A MUSICAL COMEDY.
CANTO THE SIXTH".
HENCEFORTH, until the time of production, rehearsals will be
the order of the day—and night. It is, perhaps, difficult to
make the reader realize the quantity of hard work that will be
gone through in these final weeks. The burden of this falls
most heavily on that important individual, the stage-manager,
unless one of the authors is a person of sufficient experience to
take the production of the piece into his own hands.
Nor must we forget the assistant stage-manager, who in no
small degree shares the responsibility of his superior officer.
Let us then just take a glance at the general surroundings
unrid which these operations are conducted.
The stage is wrapt in mystic gloom, save where a " T" of gas
or electric light sheds its rays. Down by the footlights, which
are not lit, is a diminutive table and a few chairs. Round
these are grouped the stage-manager, authors, composers, etc.
When the final rehearsals are on, however, as a rule, a
temporary platform is erected over the centre of the
orchestra for these individuals, so as to give more space on
the stage.
The members of the chorus, when their services are not
wanted, may be discerned sitting or wandering round the
outskirts of the stage, wYilo the principals go through their
scenes in the centre.
So line by line the piece is plodded through,
- With many a halt for "business" here and
there;
And, oh! the feelings of the authors, who
Must frequently be driven to despair,
At seeing that on which they set great store
Kuthlessly "cut," to vanish evermore.
Thearrauger Anon the services will be required
of dancei. Of him who guides the light fantastic toes;
With knowledge by Terpsichore inspired,
He will arrange full many a graceful 'pose.
And every kind of dance is in his line,
The double shuffle or the serpentine.
Thus hour by hour they work, and day by day,
No trifling point attention will escape;
Till gradually chaos will give way
To something that approaches form and shnpe.
And the stage-manager, deserving chap,
Has got another feather in his cap.
This is the sort of thing that goes on. We will presume that
the Light Comedian and the Principal Girl are going through a
scene in the centre of the stage.
Light Comedian (addressing Principal Girl). But do you mean
to say, my dear VIOLET, that your father is very strict?
Principal Girl. Oh, he 's simply dreadful 1
Stage Manager (suddenly xlwnting to some of the chorus, who
are conversing in audible whisper*). Silence, if you please,
ladies!
Light Comedian. Dear me, I shouldn't have thought it from
his photos!
PrincijMl Girl. I know, he does look benevolent; but it's all
his whiskers.
Stage Manager (making notes on the " script "). Don't forget to
cross at "whiskers," Miss BLANK.
Light Comedian. So he's a bit of a bear, eh? Well, perhaps
that comes of being connected with the Stock Exchange.
One of the Authors (nervously interrupting). 1 don't think you
put quite enough emphasis on the word "bear." There's
meant to be a little point in that. Sort of play on words!
Light Comedian. I see! [Repeats the line as required.
Principal Girl. Oh, JACK, I don't understand anything about
he Stock Exchange.
[Tlie Light Comedian delivers a rather lengthy but epigram-
matic speech, comparing tfie Stock Exchange to a
barometer.
Stage Manager. Yes, I think we'Jl cut that speech, if you don't
mind. (Murmur o] mild expostulation from one of the authors.)
Seally, my dear chap, it's much too clever for the audience
lere. We must have it out?
[The Author retires crushed. The Light Comedian and
Principal Girl continue their scene, which i» at last
brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
Stage Manager. Shan't want you any more to-day, Miss BLANK.
Shouting) Now then, ladies, please take your places for the
Concerted Number!
fair Damsel (approaching him). Please, Mr. JONES, may I have
hat line to speak after the opening chorus?
Stage Manager. Oh, don't worry, my dear girl; I can't settle
that just now.
Some more Fair Damsels. Where are we to go for our second-
act dresses, Mr. JONES?
Stage Manager. RUSSELL & TEWSOX'S, any time to-morrow.
Now then, ladies, if you please!
Low Comedian (suddenly making his appearance from the sur-
rounding gloom, where he lia» been pacing up and down, wrapt in
thought). One moment, Mr. JONES. 1 've just been thinking out
a bit of business in my scene with Miss ASTERISK. You know
where I say "No, it is in vain; you cannot move me. I am
Irish!" Well, I want half-a-dozen of the chorus men, dressed
as policemen, to come on and carry me off.
Stage Manager (dubiously). Seems a lot of trouble just for
that one exit.
Low Comedian. Well, it will get me a big laugh.
Stage Manager. I '11 see about it. Now then, ladies, if you
please. [The rehearsal is continued.
Finul Touches. And when at last the premiere draws nigh,
There's still more work, as you may understand;
The musical director, by-the-bye,
Will have to take the orchestra in hand.
Costumiers are "fitting on" with care,
And carpenters are busy ev'rywhere.
The Drew Then come the dress rehearsals, two or more,
Rehearsals. Which friendly critics watch with interest;
Turning the merits of each artiste o'er,
Discussing, too, which numbers are the best,
And will the piece give pleasure or offence
To the exacting first-night audience.
But if, at the eleventh hour, the play
Seems to be in an uncompleted state,
The new production very likely may
Be yet postponed until another date;
So as to run no risks of condemnation
Merely through insufficient preparation.
Still, even if the first-night verdict be
A most decidedly unpleasant one,
It does not follow, as a certainty,
The piece is not to have a longish run.
For it may be improved, and, more or less, .
Worked up into a regular success.
We are now, gentle reader, approaching the last scene of'al
in this strange, eventful history. AH true lovers of the drAma
are aware of the atmosphere, of excitement and expectation
which prevails at such a time. There is nothing else quite :Hke
it. Indeed, a visit to the theatre on a first-night is as diffeifen
from a visit on any ordinary occasion as champagne is

BUSINESS EXPERIENCES OF THE HON. THOMAS CASH.
BY E. T. IT.
I DETERMINED that MACDONALD should be conscious of a
master eye upon him, and for the ensuing month I can truthfully
say that there were few days of which I did not pass some part
in the brewery or its imuiediato vicinity; but it was a mis-
take.
1 have never pretended that 1 had any special acquaint-
ance with the merely technical side of brewing. It is not
yet included in the curriculum of the older Universities,
whatever Birmingham may do, and as I have already indicated
that I had dropped mathematics at about the point where we
learn .v to be an unknown quantity, xxx appeared trebly
mysterious. But it was no part of my plan to admit this to
to me at once. I think ho must have suspected some evasion,
for on Thursday he sent up a note by the office-boy to ask me to
send him word " what percentage of protonoids I considered
normal." This was an awkward fix, and I did not quite see my
way. I had not the least notion what protenoids might be. My
dictionary, which I hastily consulted under cover of my blotter,
did not mention the ridiculous things, but judging from the
uncouthness of the name they must be something undesirable,
and everything undesirable is always present in large quantities.
However, even with this to guide me I dare not risk a number,
so I ultimately wrote, "It is a matter much disputed, but 1
think PASTEUR'S estimate was correct"—as indeed I have no
doubt it was, if he ever made one on the subject. The office-boy
took the note, and as he opened the door into the brewery, I
opened the one into the street.

MACDOXALD, and 1 was unfortunately able on one occasion to
set him right on a point of chemistry. His detestable self-love
was instantly up in arras, and that was my last day of peace.
Very eariy in the following morning (Tuesday) I found
him waiting for me, to ask "whether all ordinary soluble
albumenoids were capable of peptonic modification." Fortu-
nately this question was couched in a form to which a single
affirmative seemed a sufficient answer, and I gave it unhesi-
tatingly. I could not gather much from his face, and 1 did not
wait to see as I had a train to catch, but I hoped the success of
the day's brew would not turn on its correctness.
On Wednesday morning he wanted to know " if I believed in
KAGELI'S molecular-physical theory of fermentation!" 1 felt
safer here: nothing could turn upon a mere matter of opinion,
and with a firmness born of conscious veracity—for I certainly
never believed in anything BO preposterously named—I replied
in the negative, asking him to kindly tell the cashier to come
It was with considerable misgivings that 1 entered the brewery
on Monday, but my mind was already made up, and when
] MACDONALD button-holed mo in the course of the morning,
I and peering at me over his boulders of cheek-bones desired me
I to explain to him the old theory that "fermentation was due to
oxidising azotised matter acting by catalytic influence on the
tertiary sugar," I put him firmly on one side, went home, caught
the three o'clock train to Harwich, and was in Rotterdam next
morning. It is well to keep a finger on the throbbing pulse of
trade, but a clinical thermometer under MACDONALD'S tongue,
thrust well home, would at the moment have seemed to me oven
better.
But when one's heart is in any occupation even distance and
change of scene build up feeble barriers, and as it happened I
was ableto goonwithmy work through making the acquaintance
of a Rotterdam brewer. He waa no sort of business man, for
he would sometimes spend from te.i o'clock in the morning to

five at night In his office, and even thbn havo to go again next
day) bat during such leisure as I had in a month's residence,
he instructed ttie in the Continental decoction or cooking
method of brewing, and I took occasion to write to MACDONALD
and ask if he did not think this system would lead to larger
extracts.
I had no reply and was congratulating myself that this
display of technical knowledge had impressed him, when
suddenly received a wire from PEPLOW, "Come at once, some-
thing wrong." Anyone less able than PEPLOW to cope with an
emergency I never knew. He met me at the station with the
news that MACDONALD had not been seen for several days, and
that a letter for me from him had just arrived. It briefly
thanked me for my hint about the cooking methods, and said it
did enable one to increase the extract. I was a little puzzled
about this until GCNTER, at my request, came down to look into
the accounts and cash, and then I understood: the cooking was
admirably thorough, and the extracts had been enormous.
If I had known GUNTER did not want to come, I would not
have invited him; but he should either have refused altogether
or como in a better temper. He seemed to think I was in some
way to blame, and although this was obviously unreasonable, his
jaundiced view of the matter had perhaps some influence in
determining a step which I had been meditating for some time,
nothing else, in fact, than to do without a manager entirely and
do all the work myself.
PEPLOW endeavoured to dissuade me, saying he did not think
I could do it; but I was not to be shaken, and to his further
remonstrances replied that at least nobody would suffer but
myself. He did not assent to this self-evident proposition,
merely making some irrelevant remark to the effect that "he
supposed then he could go to the sea-side," but I checked this
talk by asking if he meant to leave me in the lurch just when
I was undertaking a task which he had himself hinted might
prove beyond my strength. I have never denied that PBPLOW
is good-natured, although he lacks enthusiasm and initiative,
and I think this touched him. He and GUNTER dined with me
that evening, and after dinner I laid before them my plan.
It was this. I would convert my business into a private
limited company. GCNTER and PEPLOW should be the two other
Directors, with a merely nominal holding, and receiving the
sum of one guinea per board meeting for their services. This
was more than GUNTER was worth, but I did not wish to make
any invidious distinctions. I would be Chairman, and would
give my services gratuitously until the shareholders had
received ten per cent. I would myself hold all the shares.
Seeing that he was salaried and I was not, PEFLOW would act as
Secretary. Board meetings would be held once a week, the
Secretary and one other Director to form a quorum.
I still think that this scheme ought to have worked, for it
seemed to me well thought out, but I admit that in practice it
did not. In the first place GUNTER'S attendance was most
irregular. He was only present at ten meetings in the first
year, with the result that at only that number was a quorum
obtainable. Then PEPLOW took an exceedingly narrow view of
the duties of a Secretary, and was often absent from the brewery
for whole days, so that I never really had any trustworthy accounts
of what was taking place there. In the next place, I began to
receive complaints of the quality of the ale. Several customers
complained that it was "hard," and although I gave in-
structions that softer water should be used this did not seem to
produce the desired effect. Another wrote asking with super-
ficial politeness that his next delivery might be first hung on a
clothes-line to let the surplus water drip out. The beer began
to be returned on our hands to such an alarming extent that I
looked into the matter myself, and called in a brewery specialist.
After exhaustive examination, this gentleman gave it as his
opinion that if I would give over using my present hops, buy
some different mull, change tho yeast, and sink a new well for
purer water, I should at once feel the benefit, and that then it
would only be necessary to adopt a different principle of
brewing and alter my system of fermentation. I paid a heavy
fee for this encouragement, and neither PEPLOW nor GUNTER—
although as salaried officials they were more responsible than I
was—would contribute a single sixpence towards it.
GUNTER, however, did undertake to make up tho year's
accounts, and the result was most disheartening, disclosing as
it did that the profits were not sufficient to enable the directors'
fees to be paid. It is a selfish world, and I could not under the
circumstances blame my co-directors for wishing to withdraw;
but I might surely have expected that the3T would do so without
levity. A fishing engagement prevented my attending the next
Board meeting, but PEPLOW supplied me with a copy of the
resolutions passed at it, which were as follows:—
That it has been proved to the satisfaction of the directors
that this company, by reason of its liability to the errors
of the Chairman, cannot continue its business.
That an Extraordinary General Meeting—that is to say a
meeting at which the Chairman shall be present—be called
to consider the question of liquidation.
That the liquid assets, if no better than the sample supplied
this day in the Board-room, be drunk by the Chairman.
There was only one way of treating the matter with dignity,
and I did that at once. I purchased the one or two shares
possessed by the other nominal shareholders, and the business
once more became my sole property. A little more, and PEPLOW
would have ruined it.
I had now pretty well exhausted the resources of civilisation
in dealing with this matter. It is true I had not tried tho co-
operative principle, but a brief consideration convinced me
that inasmuch as all previous schemes had split upon the rock
of my failure to find loyal coadjutors, there would be little
hope in that direction. I should doubtless have conquered the
difficulty, as I have always done all others, but it happened
that just at this time I met MENZIES. MENZIES had l>een at
school with me, but had left comparatively early to take up a
position in his father's distillery, and he had spent seven years
in that occupation before a crisis in the whiskey trade involved
him in ruin. He was now a temperance lecturer.
I came across him through the accident of his delivering in
my neighbourhood an address, at which curiosity and the attrac-
tion of his name led me to be present. It was a very powerful
lecture entitled "Alcohol and Commonsense," and the reason-
ing by which he demonstrated that if all the money at present
spent in drink was expended in the purchase of motor curs (the
chief industry of the district) there would be such a demand
for those articles as would ruin the trade in horses, was very
well received by everyone except the local veterinary surgeon,
who left the room. I recalled myself to MENZIES' memory at the
conclusion of the proceedings, and he stayed with me for two
days: during this time tho temperance question was frequently
discussed in all its bearings, with the singular result that
whilst he convinced me that I ought not to go on profiting by
the sale of beer, I convinced him that it was a trade which in
the hands of an advocate of teetotalism would be powerful for
good.
Under these circumstances a business arrangement seemed
possible, and with the help of Messrs. PINTE & PUETA, who
negotiated a considerable loan, one was ultimately carried out.
MENZIES took over my business, paying me (by means of the
loan) half the purchase-money in cash, and the balance I left in
his hands at 7 per cent., a satisfactory rate of interest. I was
•very restloss while tho negotiations and formalities were being
carried through, but at length everything was completed, I
attached my signature to a number of formidable documents,
and walked away from my solicitor's office with the proud
consciousness that, if I had sacrificed my prospects, I was no
longer profiting by any man's weaknesses.
I think MENZIES must be doing well. He has never objected
to the rate of interest, and pays it regularly.

business-like and sensible one,
give us Londoners a real good

steamers between Folkestone

Such as the steamers have
been "they were better than

bnt they were absolutely im-
possible, that is, as a rule, and

The rough-and-tumble element
(not by any means the river

rowdiness of the 'ARRY when
his work was over and his life

temporarily, life for quiet, re-
spectable citizens on board
these crowded steamboats not
worth living by any manner of

sibility as by-water-carriers,

FRIEND.
DEAR old HAROLD POWER!
"Old!" Never a day older
than when—it seems but a few
years ago—he played Cox to the
Box of GEOKGE Du MAURIER
and to the Sergeant Bouncer of
"JOHNNIE" FORSTER in the
triumviretta of Cox and Box,
for which ARTHUR SULLIVAN
wrote such humorous, melodi-
ous, and dramatic music, as in
his best days ho himself rarely,
if ever, surpassed. HAROLD
POWER, the kindest of men,
and, in his best health, one of
the very brightest as he was
one of the most amusing, was
the last of those who belonged
to what may be called "the
ALBERT SMITH group," repre-
senting a kind of practical fun
and boisterous humour that
died out entirely with the
author of Mr. Ledbury, The
Pottleton Legacy, and with the
extinction of the Cider Cellars,
Evans's, and the Fast-After-
Midnight Life in London.
HAROLD POWER, though good
as an actor and entertainer,
was best as an amateur, acting
on the spur of the moment, say-
ing and doing the absurdest
things with the greatest possi-
ble gravity. He was associated
with "Afr. Punch's young men"
when they played for the
BENNETT benefit in Manchester,
where, with his acting and
singing in Lei* Deux Avemjlex,
with his after-supper speeches,
and with his imperturbable
•ood humour, he was the life
and soul of the party generally,
uul of the house-party at
"JOHN HENRY'S" in parti-
ular. The greatest sympathy
will be felt for his family in
their bereavement, and wo

memory of one who was
eckoned as within the private
circle of Afr. Punch's intimate
riends.

AET IN THE DOLLS' HOUSE.
BY LITTLE QUEENIE.
§ 1.—About the Need Jor Impruvement.
DEAR readers, when I laid down my pen after telling you
all about the two highly importent subjects of Nursery Cookery
and Ettiket, I fondly immajined that it was for ever—but it
has terned out otherwise!
I have been so suxessful in doing up my doll'shouse in a
thurally artistic fashion, and I recieve such lots of apeals from
cusins and similiar quarters to advise them about fernishing
theirs that I have relnctently consented to do so in these
pages.
Now, perhaps some children (like MARIA STODGELEY) will
say what does it matter how hijeous doll's fernicher etcettera
is so long as the dolls are comfortible; but this is what grown-
ups would call a falasy that begs to be questioned. It does
matter, tremenjously.
Is it not a shame that Dolls should be so behind the time,
and that, while us children have the advantiges of easthetic
wallpapers and freezes and overmantles and Art roking-horses
and chintses arid things, and our Mamas sit in rooms abounding
with Maurice curtins and Chipindale sofas and LIB vi v cosy
corners and potery on brakets and commie china pussies nud
every other luxry, our dolls should still be compelled to
reside in houses which are too Erly Victorian for words?
All grown-up and thoughtfull persons will tell you how
esenshil it is if we are to mold the charicters of the young and
instill them with noble and lofty asperations that they should
be surounded from infansy with butifnl objicts. Then they
grow up to be faltless judges and have such exqisite taste
that they never aprove of anything, like my Uncle FILIBERT
who writes the sweetest sonets and colects china and says all
effort is useless because Art and Literature are both quite
dead.
But if we go on alowing our dolls to dwell in Pilistine
suroundings, how can we be surprized if they do not look more
inteligent or if they are deficient in jeneril culcher?
§ 2.—The Tippicle Dolls' House.
Let us exsamine for a moment the apearance, both outside
and in, of the convenshunil Dolls' House.
The front is painted the inevittible stairing red, with white
round the windows, the door and balkny being a krude pea-
grene; the knoker gilt and of some cheap and inartistic patern
which will not knok. The droin-room windows are curtined
with mashine-made lace or else crochy.
We enter, having first previously unhooked the front (for the
door is a paultry shamb!) and what do we find? An interior
devided into four compartments, like a rabit hutch. [FLORRIE
BUCKMASTER did keep rabits in her dolls' house for a time—
but it was not a suxess.] There is no trace of any hall, or even
passidge. There are no doors, so if a droin-room doll should
find herself in the kitchen or nursery by any chance, there she
has got to remane till some cumpationat hand releses her to her
propper sfere!
And the wall-papers I Gordy yuge paterns which most house-
maids would shuder at on their bedrooms walls. As for the
carpits, they will either be painted seppilkers or else peices of
oilclothes. Are there any windows at the sides or back? No,
there are not. Well, at least there are stares? No, the clever
grownups who bild these atrosities have left out the stares.
They do not seem aware that dolls (mostly) posess legs!
Then the fernicher. Think of the droin-room, with its
mene little mantlepeice which never wilt go close up to the
wall and has red tinsle fire in it! The round table—in the
center, if you please !—and a sofa of a similiar patern to the one
at our last seaside lodjins, which made mummy so ill she had to
buy an Itallian rug to cover it up with and it was all Father's
fault for taking the first rooms he saw to save himself trubble
and because they were cheap 1
Regard the six chares, all exacly alike, red or green sattin
and white wood; the pianno that won't even open (though I
wouldn't mind if we had one of that sort in our scoolroom!)
and the pictuers on the walls, hung crookid and jenerilly
oliografts by artists of no repputation!
Let my readers who think this discripshun exajerated give an
imparshil glance at their own dolls' houses, and then see if it
is not corect—and this is the best room out of four!
Yet it is in such squoller as this that the majorrity of our
dolls pass their lives in! Sometimes I hear Father talking
about the necessity of rehousing the Poorer Classes, but I think
Dolls require it much more because they are less able to make
their voices heard.
§ 3.—About Eforts at Better Things.
[ don't mene of course that alt dollshouses are as badly bilt as
this. Within my own reccolection there have sprung up in our
midst edifishes with more claim to be called arkitecshur. FUJJS
CLOVER has one she is awfuly proud of and it really is rather
nice. It has a blue sloping roof with real windows and
chimnies in it, a portico with steps up to it and a dear little
ellectric bell which really rings, and there is a passidge and
stares and doors to open and shut in every room.
But as I told FILLIS (and it did make her so cross) the
passidge is too dredfuly pokey and there are no bannisters to
the stares and a visitor would have to rech the droinroom
through a hole in the floor—which peple do not do in Society.
Now my own Papa is an Arkitect and very clever. He is
always doing plans for Goverment bildings only there is BO
mnch favoritism that only the Old Gang and Rank Outsiders get
chosen.
So I said to him one day, " Dear Papa, if nobody else will give
you a job, I will. Supose you sit down and do me a design for
a really convenient dollshouse?"
Papa laufed, but did it and it really was too sweet, with a
Queen Ann portch and the most facinatiug bo-windowa and
little curved balknics aud a lovely wide starecase and curly
bannisters and a conservitry and well—everything.
I was perfidy delited with it, only when I took the desine
to a toyshop man and asked what it would cost to make up he
said it would work out at about fifty pound.
So I was obbliged to tell Papa that as I had only seven and
sixpence (counting the half-crown Aunt Mary gives me on my
next birthday) I was ajra.de his dosine was beyond my menes at
present, and Papa laufed and said I reminded him of his other
cliants.
I shall have to save up for severil years before I shall have
enough to bild Papa's desine for a dollshouse, but in the mcne-
time I resolved to make the best of my old one. So I called in
a particler friend of mine, REGGY SAWYER, who is very clever
with his fingers and has just had a new toolbox, and I told
REGGY what impruvments I wanted done and ho did it.
First he threw out two wings with wood made out. of Father's
sigar boxes (after carefuly putting all the sigars back in the
cubbard again) and REGGY got the glass for the windows out
of fotoframes in the droinroom. After cuting through the
partishun on the ground floor, he constructed a splendid hall
and starecase. The bannisters were rather a bother at first,
till I reccolected that there were gilded ratings round some
Louey Cans tables and things in the droin-room, and these,
with a little twisting, made a highly efective ballastrade. We
found a cabbinet of soft white wood contaniug trays of
meddles and things which were no use, and the wood was just
enough to make a top story.
When Papa found out, he said it would have been almost
cheaper to have carrid out his orijinil plans but I fansy he
was secretly plesed with our injinuity—though not Mother.
So now I was the posessor of a really roomy and convenient

respective Authors of " Elizabeth and her German Garden," and
"The Visits of Elizabeth." Extracts from the former's Diary
and the Jotter's Letters are given alternately, the younger
Elizabeth being on a visit to the elder Elizabeth.]
MARCH 17TH.—I remember reading in a wise book that a fresh
acquaintance coming among close friends is always a bore.
Well, ELIZABETH is the fresh acquaintance, and the close friends
are myself and I, which includes my garden and my books.
I really believe the babies dimly understand, and are doing
their best to act as buffers. The Michaelmas Goose baby,
whose equilibrium is still unstable, drags ELIZABETH about by
her skirts, singing lustily her favourite Sunday hymn—" Some
day my earthly house will fall!" Yesterday, the March Hare
baby tried to distract our visitor by an invitation to-a game of
Adam and Eve in the garden. "And you shall pwetend to
be EVA, if you like, Fraulein ELSE," she said, encouragingly.
"But wouldn't it be rather cold?" protested ELIZABETH.
The March Hare baby, who is much less ingenuous than
ELIZABETH, grew red in the cheeks and said, "You keeps your
flngs on, naturllch. It looks properlier."
"And how will you do for a serpent?" asked ELIZABETH,
whose nature is sadly reliant "on the concrete, and cannot
realise the unseen world.
"We 'se got a weal live snake," said the May Meeting baby,
"but it's gestnft, so you won't be bited."
"And I will be the Apfel," added the March Hare baby, "and
when yon eats me I will unagreo wiv you insides."
"But there isn't anybody to be ADAM," said ELIZABETH,
thinking to raise an insurmountable difficulty.
The March Hare baby dealt -with it promptly and conclusively,
not without some show of pity for ELIZABETH'S limited intelli-
gence. "The Gartner, he will be ADAM," she said: "ADAM,
in Mummy's story was a Gartner, auch."
The principal roles being thus distributed, with the other
babies as mute supers representing the Lion pensive beside the
Lamb, symbols of the peace of Eden about to be so rudely dis-
turbed, I was able to retire to what the play-bill would call
"Another glade in Paradise," and talk in solitude with my
larches. But that remark of ELIZABETH'S kept preying on my
mind—"There isn't anybody to be Adam!" Such a want of
imagination; and such a confession of a woman's standard of
desire as popularly accepted! I shall certainly have to telegraph
for the Man of War. For either he -would consent to be
amused by a kind of humour that differs essentially from mine,
or else, if she failed to win him from his iron, mood, he would
direct her attention, with paralysing frankness, to the limited
purpose served by all women in any decently ordered scheme
of society.
22ND.—Dearest Mamma,—You can't think what a dismal time I
am having. Some stodgy Fraus have called, but nothing in the
shape of a man. And even then I didn't count because I
wasn't married; as if one could possibly marry a German,
anyhow. What an awful price to pay for being allowed into
their cackling old hen yards! One of the frumps was talking
of a French girl, in Berlin, whose engagement with a German
officer was broken off because he saw her trying to climb on to
the top of a tram-car. "Wasn't it real lace," I asked, "or
was her ankle too bulgy?" All the three Fraus turned round
with a jerk and put up their glasses at me, and then looked at
the Grafin, as much as to say, "What is this thing?" So the
Grafln explained to me that the French girl, being a foreigner
like me, didn't know that the law wouldn't let women ride on
the top of trams, because it was bad for morals. Aren't they
funny, Mamma? I know I should always be in prison or some-
where if I lived here; not that it would make much difference,
after being in this house.
I don't so much mind the plain living, and I could easily do
without stupid damsons and things with my beef; but it's what
she calls the " high thinking " that is so difficult. Of course, I
don't often say aloud what I 'm thinking about, but 1 know,
by the Grafln's eye, that she can always tell that it isn't high
enough. Don't be surprised, will you, Mamma, if I telegraph
some day for you to write and tell mo to come home? The only
thing that consoles me here is looking forward to the Man-
of-War coming. Meantime I'm wearing to a thread, and CELKS-
TINE talks of taking in my waists, and I really ought to be as fat
as possible to please the Man-of-War, because they must be
used to the natives being podgy. So I shall go in for what
they call Swine-cutlets and Munich Beer, which are very
developing.
Your affectionate) daughter,
ELIZABETH.
26TH.—I cannot pretend to be very sorry that ELIZABETH has
suddenly announced that she has to leave the day after to-
morrow; besides, I can now wire to the Man of War to say
that he need not come; and so I shall have the pink silence
jf the pines all to myself. I really had tried to improve her
by simple processes like the sight of a sunset through woods;
and when I saw a far-away look in her eyes I thought I was
having a certain success, till she said, "I do like that; I
simply must have a gown of that shade." Failing hero I was
not likely to succeed on subtler points, such as the alertness
of tulips or the stooping divinity of nasturtiums.
I think myself fortunate to have got rid of ELIZABETH so
easily. For a big girl, she is much too aggressively innocent.
I always suspect people of that kind; they seem like Persian
Yellows, very plausible to the careless eye, but with strange
crawling things inside them when you look closer.
And now to go and dance with my daffodils!
28TH.—Dearest Mamma, thank you for answering my telegram
so quickly, and telling me I may come home at once, 1 will
explain why. Such a funny thing happened four days ago. It
came out as quite the most natural thing in the world that the
Grafln is married to the Man-of-War! You can guess how
staggered I was and nearly choked over my Swine-cutlet,
because it sounded just like a harem, or something of that
sort, only the other way about. I had hardly breath enough
to ask if this was the same Man-of-War that she was expecting
to-morrow, and the Grafln looked quite surprised and said how
could there be more than one Man-of-War, and 1 didn't know
whether she meant that the German fleet was so small, but
anyhow I agreed with her that one Man-of-War was quite
enough to be married to at once, though I didn't say so. And
then it struck me that if they were all married to her, all the
officers, I mean, there would be nobody left over for me, be-
sides it not being quite nice for me to stay in a house with
a hostess married to so many people, though CELESTINE says
it wouldn't include the warrant-officers; but then she is so
selfish and only thinks about herself. And that's why I sent
you the telegram, and please expect me soon after this arrives.
Of course, I always said the Grafln was a stuffy old bore, but

JEERS, IDLE JEERS!
MINE is, alas! a flippant muse,
If she's a heart she docs not show it,
So she and I have different views;
I want to be a real poet!
I want my versos to be read
With tears by men of lofty station,
I want a statue, when I 'm dead,
Erected by a grateful nation!
I 'm sick of -writing ribald rhymes,
I 'm tired of cutting humorous capers,
I want nil/ poems in The Times
And all the other daily papers.
Like LEWIS MORRIS I will sing
—At quite unnsual length—of Hades.
The critics say that sort of thing
Is very much admired by ladies.
With WILLIAM WATSON I '11 declaim
Armenia's woes and make you shudder,
Or rival EDWIN ARNOLD'S fame,
By writing further reams on Buddha.
I feel a playwright's fire in me,
I do not hesitate to say it;
I '11 write a blank verse tragedy
And Mr. BRERBOHM TREE shall play it.
I '11 turn out patriotic lays,
And make the music-halls recite them;
They'll win me universal praise—
And almost any fool can write them.
My lyrics shall surpass belief,
I '11 shine alike in song and sonnet;
And when my country comes to grief
1 'II write ii threnody upon it.
Till AUSTIN, weary of the way
Those wicked critics daily twit him,
Will lay aside his wreath of bay
—Which really never seems to fit him.
Then all the other bards who try
To seize the crown will be rejected,
For nobody can doubt that I
Shall Ix; the gentleman selected.
The papers will be charmed to hear
That one fine morning I've
knighted,
And later, when I 'm made a peer.
They will be equally delighted.
And when my day of death is come
I shall, 1 hope, like Master HORNER,
Pluck from life's pie one final plum
Serenely in the Poet's Corner.

him to earth at Clapham Junction. But
he slipped through my fingers on both
occasions. Curse him, he is as slippery

round cautiously, as if we were expecting
someone.
We walk carefully one before the other
both keenly on the alert. Suddenly he
turns round, and now we are face to face.
I rush at him. He rushes at me. There
is a terrible struggle, but I have the
better of it.
"I arrest you!" I exclaim, with as
much dignity as I can muster after a
quarter of an hour's fight.
"Nonsense!" cries my capture. "Non-

THE SPLENDID BANKRUPT.
(Being a flint to our Legislators and a
Reminder to the Official Receiver.)
UNDER its spreading bankruptcy
The village mansion stands;
Its lord, a mighty man is he,
With large, broad-acred lands;
And the laws that baulk his creditors
Are strong as iron bands.
His laugh is free and loud and long,
His dress is spick-and-span;
He pays no debt with honest sweat,
He keeps whate'er he can,
And stares the whole world in the face,
For he fears not any man.
Week in, week out, from morn till night,
Prince-like he runs the show;
And a round of social gaieties
Keeps things from getting slow—
As the agent of his wife, of course,
His credit's never low.
His children, coming back from school,
Bless their progenitor,
Who 's ruffling at the yearly rate
Of fifteen thou. or more,
Nor care they how his victims fly
To the workhouse open door.
He goes on Sunday to the church
With all whom he employs,
To hear the parson pray and preach,
Condemning stolen joys;
It falls like water off his back—
His conscience ne'er annoys.
Scheming, promoting, squandering,
Onward through life he goes;
Each morning sees some "deal " begun,
Each evening sees it close;
Some coup attempted, someone " done,"
Has earned a night's repose.
Thanks, thanks, to thee, my worthy friend
For the lesson thou hast taught!
Thus in the busy City life
Our fortunes must be wrought;
Thus does the Splendid Bankrupt thrive
While honest fools get nought !]

In all her works there 's nothing new.
But what is sadder to relate
She will not bring them up to date.
She forms a mountain and then fails
To furnish it with train and rails.
She takes decades to mould a crater
And then forgets the elevator.
Such carelessness, pray, who conl
pardon?
She wonderfully plans a garden,
A natural haven of delight
And overshadows it by night,
Leaving the Yankee, most Twen-centy,
To fit it up with arc lights twenty.
So now the works you can compare
Of Nature with the millionaire.
How faint the glories of the skies
Compared with Yankee enterprise!

Supplied with countless music halls.

SPRING, while at you the cynics rail,
Your fickleness arraigning,
Not ours your coldness to assail,
With querulous complaiuing.
To you glad greetings still we bring,
With vernal transports glowing,
For, though you might be milder, spring,
It is not always suowing.
Though frequent blizzards swirl and shriek
Our very marrows freezing.
And though the climate hard and bleak
Sets feeble wind-pipes wheezing;
We at our snug firesides can stay,
In cosy armchairs, knowing
The clouds will pass away some day—
It is not always snowing.
Nay then, sweet spring, we still can smile
Though by your scourgings smitten,
Ami though we sneeze and shiver, •while
By your keen tooth we're bitten;
This thought can mitigate our pains,
A soothing balm bestowing—
Sometimes it only hails and rains,
It is not always snowing.

OPEEATIC PEOSPECTS.
SOME say tho season's'going to be a French 'un.
The ground for which assertion, I may mention,
Is, that a name whereon I place my finger,
In the subscribers' list is " Paris Singer."
"Which," as says EUCLID, "is absurd." Dismiss it.
All ask if Madame MELBA •will revisit
The stage she brightens •with her charming trill?
Her answer's yet to come; perhaps she will.
"Well, " if she will, she will, you may depend on "t,"
"And if she won't, she won't, and there 's an end on "t."
Yet with good names the opera programme teems—
ADAMS, TERNINA, BAUERMEISTER, EAMKS,
MAUBOUHG and GADSKY, BREMA and SOBRINO,
And of the others many have we seen? No.
But there is one whom all will hail with " Halve!"
That great dramatic singer, Madame CALVE.
Now for " the spear side" : Would you hear " Otello " f
Then here 's TAMAGNO ; he 's the very fellow!
PI.ANCON, SALKZA, BISPHAM, COAXES, and BLASS
As Dogberry, singing, "Write me down an ass,"
In opera, by VILLIERS STANFORD, who'
Has set to music SHAKSPEARE'S " Much Ado."
Names of VAN DYCK, VAN ROOY, the list has got:
Two Vans for all this Covent Garden lot!
They Ml sing their songs as well as e'er they 've sung 'em,
Although you '11 note they 've but one £note among them!
The orchestra as large and good as ever.
PLON, MANCINELLI, both Conductors clever.
With FORSYTH Manager success is certain;
But, hush! The overture 1 .... Ring up the curtain!
OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
A DAINTY little book for tho pocket is the collection of TENNY-
SON'S Love Poems (JOHN LANE). The Easter holiday-maker,
travelling for recreation, will do well to carry this with him,
and learn half a poem a day.
"Hullo, here's a church!" said Mr. Wemmick, walking
through Walworth, Miss Sklffins on his arm. "Let's go in and
get married." "Hullo!" says Mr. BARING-GOULD, "there's
much talk just now in Blue Books and Parliament about lead
poisoning in the earthenware works. Let "s go down to the
Potteries and write a novel." This he does, calls it TJie
Frobishers, and Mr. MKTHUEN publishes it. It is a sadly
inartistic piece of work. In hardly any scene are the flats
joined. The materials are older than the first number of the
London Journal. There is the rightful heir (Beaudessart) re-
instated, the superseded family, including a lovely girl, left
destitute. This makes an opening for the Potteries, and for
Mr. BARING-GOULD to work up information about work there
learned in a flying visit. There is the leering, lustful manager
of the works; the virtuous girl, who is finally married to the
re-instated heir, and lives happy evermore in her old home.
"A poor thing," my Baronite says. "But mine own," retorts
Mr. BARING-GOULD, capping the quotation.
In Tim Wizard's Knot (FISHER UNWIN) WILLIAM BARRY [tout
court, for is he not the Reverend and "D.D." to boot?] has
written a romance of Irish life which, in many respects, other
writers in the same field of literature would find hard to beat.
His gift of poetic description, his thorough knowledge and
genuine appreciation of certain phases of the Celtic character,
coupled with his power of life-like portraiture (for they are
more than sketches of those who have unconsciously served
him as models) give to his work a charm which, as a mere tale,
it does not possess. The story is thin, and it is not long
before whatever interest has been awakened at the com-
mencement is obscured by clouds of far-fetched epithets or
ostin a labyrinth of puzzling paragraphs. Sometimes the Baron
las paused in his pleasurable toil to wonder if BARJIY could
possibly be the Irish spelling of MEREDITH. Nevertheless, the
haractcr of O'Dwyer, scholar, peasant, poet, hedge-school-
master, m«dici-nc-man and wizard, is a masterpiece.
In Two Sides of a Question MAY SINCLAIR (ARCHIBALD CON-
STABLE & Co.) gives us two stories, of which, my Baronitess
says, the second, "Superseded," is the better. Both stories
are somewhat pessimistic, and should therefore be read when
yon are in the best of health on a sunshiny day. The second
story is notable for its quaint touches of character in the
narrow life of a middle-aged teacher of arithmetic.
"Finding on my table," quoth the studious and indefatigable
Baron, "a book entitled Veronica Vernon, the first chapter,of
which was headed 'I vegetate,' it occurred to me that MINA
SANDEMAN'S Veronica Vernon Vegetarian (JOHN LONG) offered a
prospect no less of entertainment than, judging from its dedi-
cation ' to the Blessed Angels on spheres of light,' and to 'all
champions of the helpless,' of instruction." So the Baron
bravely went to work; and in the course of perusal took a
considerable amount of exercise [in the way of skipping, by
which means he sped along with agility to Chapter XV., headed
"I receive a shock," and the story being sufficiently interest-
ing (somewhat after the manner of that very original "My
dear Diary," of years ago) to warrant the Baron's seeing it
through to the bitter (or sweet) end, the undaunted Baron
bent to his work with stern determination. He passed to
Chapter XVI. Story going well, interest improving; nearing
the aena&ment. Now for Chapter XVII Hallo! No
Chapter XVII.!!! But instead, Chapter XV. over again, with
same heading "I receive a shock." The Baron did, indeed,
"receive a shock!" Rarely has he ever been so "shock'd."
The numbers, too, of the pages had got mixed. Here is 296
next to 265, and at".280 the book finishes with this broken line,
"' You look very pensive, Miss VEEDANT,' remarked"
That's all. "Here break we off"—with a vengeance. Who
"remarked "? What did he remark? There's no intimation
that the story is to be " continued in our next." No ; nothing.
As, on a memorable occasion, Miss SQUEERS exclaimed, " Is this
the hend ?" so, aspirate included, basks the disappointed and
PUZZLED BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
THE DRINK OF PEERS.
[" Ginger ale" ia advertised "as drunk in the House of Lords."]
COME, fill the cup! The peers look wan and pale,
And 'neath their legislative labours fail;
Half round the hours the minute hand hath stole;
Enough! come fill the cup with ginger ale!
Fill high the foaming nectar! Do not fear
To quaff the sparkling cup, for every peer,
Though drinking, shall be sober: it alone
Is drunk within the gilded chamber here.
Far other drinks our fathers used to swill
From sunny vineyard or from Highland still;
But since a gouty habit they bequeathed
To us, we needs must be teetotal still.
Although for smallest mercies we would fain
Express due gratitude, mere doles are vain
To make our shrunken rent-rolls what they were,
And ginger ale is cheaper than champagne.
If by some strange mischance (and here's the rub!)
The Children's Bill, despite the CECIL'S snub,
Should pass this session, whom have we to send
To fetch our modest pewter from the pub.?
Then let the baffled brewers wrathful rail,
And curse the Lords for their decreasing sale;
Health, purse, necessity together cry,
"Come, fill the cup, ye Peers, with ginger ale!"

CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOB YOUNG EIDERS.
CHAPTER XI.
Hunting-types—T/ie Veteran, " 0/<J Ribs."
THERE is in every hunt at least ono veteran who has followed
those particular hounds since he was a boy, who swears by
them as the very best pack in the world, who comes out
with them still on every hunting day, and whose words
are regarded with an almost superstitious reverence by
all the rest. His dress conveys an idea of immemorial
antiquity, suggesting the sporting pictures of a day long
since gone by. His hat is low-crowned and broad-brimmed,
his chin is sunk into the folds of an ample hunting-stock
with a plain gold pin to keep it together. His coat is of a
sub-fuse hue, his breeches are of serviceable brown cord, and
his legs are cased in an old pair of butcher boots made of limp
leather and heavily crinkled and wrinkled from top to bottom.
His spurs make no pretence to ape the fashion; they are short
and curved, rather than long and straight. His queer old crop
with its brown thong adds a final touch of character to his
make-up. His nag, like his breeches, is meant for service
rather than for show—a, bony, angular grey, short-coupled and
as hard as nails, emphatically not a horse,
Swift as the Arab steed that leads the rush
Of tiirbaned warriors.
nor one on which you would choose to make an effort
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
but, nevertheless, a horse that invariably manages, with the
cheery, grey-whiskered veteran on his back, to be well up with
the hounds when the run ends, no matter what the country
may 1x3 over which the fox has led them in his race for life«
Wonderful stories are told of this horse, his patriarchal age,
his capacity for endurance, his marvellous wisdom. "Old
Ribs " he is called by the younger and light-minded members
of the hunt, who yet, one and all, profess and feel an un-
bounded admiration for his prowess and that of his rider. It
was "Old Ribs" who, when his master once fell off into a
thick and muddy ditch (we are all human, even the oldest of
us; and we all fall now and then), sat by him—"Yes, Sir, I
give you my word of honour, sat by him like "a dog'1—the
old gentleman having wrenched his leg and being unable to
struggle out, and eventually summoned assistance by plucking
a farm-labourer by his smock until he induced the astounded
rustic to follow him to the scene of the disaster. And it was
"Old Ribs" who, on the following hunting day, his master
being still laid up, managed to escape from his loose-box and
appeared at the front door at the usual time bearing his
master's hunting crop in his mouth. There are a hundred
other stories, all equally veracious, and all bearing testimony
to the virtues of this unparalleled animal, who has never within
the memory of other veterans been young, and will never grow
old. Some clay, years and years hence, a flight of shining winged
horses will descend upon the stable where "Old Ribs" has
his home and will bear him away to another happv ground
where there is no wire fencing, and where ghostly hounds chase
shadowy foxes for ever through the asphodel country without
a check. But in the meantime this typo of perennial equine
middle-age remains to delight our hunt and to carry his gallant
old master. He is a. horse of character and has opinions of his
own. Certain fences there are that he simply won't jump, and
when he comes to one of them ho just stops and turns his wise
old head round. His rider knows him too well to try to flog
him or spur him over. He dismounts in the most amiable and
accommodating way, and while the youngsters are charging and
blundering and scrambling to right and to left of him he takes
the reins in his hand, gets over the ditch, climbs the bank,
brings "Old Ribs" cheerfully after him, and so down on the other
side without any silly fuss or ceremony. It is a convention
between horse and rider, and each does his part perfectly.

UNANSWERABLE.
Yotmy Impecunious Swell (rather proud of hisjvjure. and anxious to
produce a great effect at a forthcoming County Ball—to Tailor). "I SAT,
MY FRIEND, DO MB A OREAT FAVOUR ; LET ME HAVE THIS NEW SUIT
BY .THE END OF THE WEEK, AND I SHALL BE FOP. EVER AND KVEll
INDEBTED TO YOU."
Tailor. "THANK YOU MUCH, SIR; BUT I THINK, ON CONSIDERA-
TION, I SHOULD PREFER A CHEQUE DOWN, SrE.V UNDER A SLIGHT
DISCOUNT."
"Why don't you put the saddle on and let the horse mount
you?" said an irreverent novice when he saw this performance
being gone through. The old man made no reply, but he had
his quiet revenge. At the next fence the scoffer parted
company with his fiery Bucephalus, and the veteran as he
passed tossed him a ginger biscuit, saying, "It's all I can
spare," and left him gazing disconsolately at the vanishing
flight of hounds and horsemen.
RATHER "OUT OF IT"

A SHAKSPEAEIAN SOUVENIR.
FIRST-HATE idea of Mr. TREE'S (whose impersonation of
Malvolio is a masterpiece of comicality), especially when
carried out to something nearly approaching perfection, is
that of presenting your audience with a ''souvenir" of
the fiftieth or hundredth night of the run of a Shakspearian
or, for the matter of that, of any other play. Now this
artistic "souvenir," very cleverly drawn by CHAS. BUCHEI,
and reproduced in colour by HENTSCHEL LTD., is of itself
an attraction to re-visit Her Majesty's. The likenesses arc
excellent, invaluable to a theatrical collector; but, as they
arc likenesses only of the "characters," would it not add
considerably to the value of another "souvenir" were the
portraits of actresses or actors in everyday attire placed in
juxta-position to that of themselves "in character"? Would
it not be an invaluable lesson in the art of "making-up "?
Would it not be an additional tribute to the artistic talent
of the actor, for every actor must have in him, more or less,
the germs of the historical artist's peculiar power? Sometimes
the actor has to reproduce historical portraiture: at other
times he has to consult the author, and draw the portrait of the
character he is assuming from the latter's conception of it.
But in a play of Shakspearian funcy he has to determine for
himself, or to blend his own idea with that of whoever is
charged with the production of the piece. However, this is
not an essay on "the art of 7naking-up," and Afr. Punch's
Representative has only to record the vast improvement of
Miss MAri) JEFFRIES' Olivia (since the flrst night) and the con-
tinued success of Tivelfth Night, which, filling Her Majesty's
nightly, bids fair, judging from the present undoubted popu-
larity, to achieve an exceptionally long run.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THK DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 25.—
"When C.-B. is away the SQUIRE doth
play," said SARK, dropping into poetry,
and, unlike Mr. Silas Wegg, scorning to
make extra charge.
Leader of Opposition at home nursing a
cold, SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, returning to
old work, took his place and, to a certain
extent, made things hum. That very hard
task after an hour's experience with dull-
witted Irishmen of the type of O'DOHERTV
trying their hand at the game of baiting
Ministers with questions. Nevertheless,
SQUIRE in good form. Recalled old times
when gentlemen on Front Bench lived up
to axiom that the duty of an Opposition is
to oppose. Harking back to controversy
last week when PRINCE ARTHUR, designing
to dish obstructionists, submitted Civil
Service Estimates in lump sum, the SQUIRE
extracted from SPEAKER a ruling that will
prevent its repetition. Also ho made
clear inconvenient fact that when BROD-
RICK, disclosing new Army plan, announced
that the Navy would hereafter look after
the coaling stations he counted without
the Admiralty.
PRINCE ARTHUR a great admirer of the
SQUIRE'S.
"HARCOURT," he once said to tho
MEMBER FOR SARK, " is the last survivor
of the old type of the highest form of the
House of Commons man."
That an abstract opinion, dropped in
flush of generous talk about an ancient
foeman. In the concrete, aggravating to
the sweetest temper to have the SQUIRE
unexpectedly waking up and showing how
an Opposition ought to be led. He sub-
mitted his point of order to the SPEAKER

,The Concrete (Sir Wm. H-rc-rt) pitches into the
Abstract (Mr. B-ll-r).

(AS IT PROMISES TO BB— UGH I ! )
at prodigious length. Question reached
proportions of ordinary speech.
"I understand," said PRINCE ARTHUR,
with wicked emphasis on the numeral,
"the right hon. gentleman submitted one
question on one point of order."
Then in snappish tone he proceeded, as
briefly as possible, to defend the action
taken.
Bad enough to have Irish Members
yelping at his heels night after night
through the week, coarsely belittling his
gifts as Leader. To have the SQUIRE OF
MALWOOD suddenly resuming reins of
leadership a visitation equivalent to the
last straw. The Leader of the House of
Commons is, after all, almost human.
Business done. — Appropriation Bill
brought in.
Tuesday night. — House adjourned at
quarter to live this morning; SPEAKER
took chair again at three this afternoon.
Shifts in n coal mine easy going compared
with this. Tho sturdy miner shares the
labour of a day with another, and would
raise the roof off the mine if he were
called upon to extend one of his working
shifts for an uninterrupted space of four-
teen hours.
Board of Guardians, or of a Vestry. The
Mother of Parliaments knows better. Tho
first and freshest four hours of the sitting
were given vip to a Private Bill. Then
came cloud of Questions darkening the
dinner hour. At length, in almost empty
House, a few tired-out Members pro-
ceeded to Debate Second Reading of
Appropriation Bill.
Proceedings deadly dull. House in
comatose state. Shortly after midnight
Members on Ministerial side, waking out
of troubled doze, found SPEAKER on his
legs putting question; groped their way
into Division Lobby, and so home to bed.
Business done.—Appropriation Bill read
a second time.
Thursday night.—Like the burglar's, the
life of the Under Secretary for Foreign
Affairs is not wholly a happy one. Since
he came into the family heritage, SON AND
HEIR has been singularly unfortunate.
To begin with, there was his delightfully
frank, but disastrous, remark about
COUSIN ARTHUR forbidding him when
replying to Questions to say anything in
supplement of what is written out for him.
Then there was tho row about his Chief's
confidences to the Lords on the Tientsin

ing close of financial year must get it-
through all stages before Saturday.
Natural to suppose House meeting
again this afternoon would straightway
proceed to Second Reading of the Bill.
That would be all very well for gather-
SON AND HEIR not responsible for either
of these misfortunes. PRINCE ARTHUR
imposed on him the first; LANSDOWNE
everything to do with second.
To-night promised reparation. Task
committed to him of explaining to Com-
ing of private commercial company, of|mons position of affairs in China. Had

ordinary course been followed, and this
question of Imperial interest come on
nunediately after Questions, all would
have been well. .SON AND HEIR would
aave had population of the Vineyard in
attitude of strained attention; fresh him-
self, would have talked to unwearied
ears. What happened was that, South
Africa winning the toss, went to the
wickets. Some sharp play, with DON
Jos6 in best slogging form. Debate
trailed on through dinner hour; that in
itself bit of good luck; seemed to pro-
mise SON AND HEIR'S opportunity about
ten o'clock, the best hour for speaking
after 7.30. Members come in from dinner
with minds!and bodies refreshed, in
genial mood to welcome promising effort.
Alack! BASHMEAD-ARTLETT was to the
fore. Since Question time he had per-
vaded premises. What with LANSDOWNK
up in the Lords discoursing on China,
with SON AND HEIR in Commons liable to
be turned on same topic any moment,
BASHMEAD had rather exciting evening.
Lines of strangers waiting in outer Lobby
from time to time startled by meteoric
flight; were conscious of the swift pass-
ing of tall figure with flushed face, lank
locks, a glass gleaming in one eye like a
perturbed beacon, a mass of drab-coloured
pocket - handkerchief protruding from
coat-tail pocket. Some said it was the
new star, Nova Persei, astray from its un-
accustomed orbit. Police explained it
was "only ASHMKAD-BARTLETT."
Needn't have been in such hurry.
Foreign Secretary finished his statement,
and had comfortably dined, before China
Question reached in Commons, and the
Sheffield Knight, rising, poured out by the
hour what SARK describes as "a washy
flood of turbulent trash." Half-past eleven
before SON AND HEIR got a look in ; did
very well, considering how sorely he was
handicapped.

a third time.

celestial fire which flamed about his con-
temporaries DISRAELI, GLADSTONE, BRIGHT

Inspector of Schools. He obtained that

£2,000 a year and a retiring pension of
£866, enjoyed till the close of his life.
Letters addressed to him by Mr. G. are
embargoed pending conclusion of JOHN

ILDERS in his own correspondence suc-
ceeds in throwing side-lights on that
multiplex character. We who lived with
urn in the House of Commons remember
lis gift of convincing people that what-
iver was (at the moment expedient) was
right. I can see him now as, nineteen
years ago, the British Fleet having bom-
3arded Alexandria and a British Army

is speech announcing the demand, Mr.

necessity without once mentioning Russia!

On the 15th July, 1882, he wrote to
CHILDKRS, then Minister for War, sug-
gesting that the troops should be placed
under command of the Naval authorities
avowedly for police purposes, "so as to
avoid even the semblance of invasion, and
the consequent suspicion and serious diffi-
culties that would arise if we landed a

manders."
Isn't that delicious? Does more to
reveal the inner man than a tome 01

two volumes. The veil is withdrawn
from the perplexities of the dividec

epoch, 1882—85. In the latter year came

AND HK NEVER GOT IT BACK!
He is truly idem semper
With this lamentable lack.

Does he wish to be insipid?
No, it grieves him to the soul.

All the children love to pelt him
With potatoes in the street;
And to take a belt and belt him

Yet, you '11 ever find him lenient
To tbe]hooligan*and rough;
Though it 's highly inconvenient
To be never in a huff.
For his hat is badly battered,
And the bead that 's underneath
Often has its'sensesjscattered
With the loss of sundry teeth.
In this most unhealthy fashion
He is treated, for they know
That he hasn't any passion
Or vindictiveness to show.
And he longs with such a longing
For the temper he has lost!
For the righting of the wronging
Which his carelessness has cost.
But his temper 's gone for ever,
All his longing is in vain
(He who found it thought it clever
Not to part with it again).
Ne'er again this hapless victim
Will be angry with a bore,
Nor with anyone who kicked him
Vet impatient any more!

If you really wish to quarrel,
NEVER LOSE YOUR TEMPER, friend.

THE EVOLUTION OF A MUSICAL COMEDY.
CANTO THE SEVENTH.
The First- 'Tts come at last! the most eventful night
Night. Which press and public have awaited long;
The Thespian temple, all ablaze with light,
Welcomes a large and fashionable throng,
Which through the vestibule serenely flocks
To stalls, drerw-circle, or a private box.
Characteristics The cheaper portions of the house will be
Pilled with those persons who are none the less
Critics of recognized ability
Although they may not put on evening'dress,
And pit and gallery have borne the brunt
Of waiting hours to get a seat in front.
Notice the hum and chatter that pervade
The auditorium in ev'ry part;
While by the "gods" sweet melody is made
Until the tuneful overture shall start.
And now and then will rise a storm of cheers,
As some distinguished personage appears.
Now from the orchestra there comes the sound
Of tuning up, with many a scrape and squeak;
And restless eyes, that have been roving round,
A certain spot beneath the footlights seek,
Whence will emerge, with baton in his hand,
The chief composer, to conduct the band.
The Conductor See, there he is ! and volleys of applause
take) his Seat. prom ev'ry quarter his appearance greet;
Repeatedly he bows—then comes a pause,
As in the orchestra he takes his seat.
A glance at his musicians, ev'ryone;
He waves his hand—the overture's begun.
What follows need not be described at great length. The
render has probably been present at many such first-nights.
Ho knows the applause which greets every popular artiste,
an he or she appears during the progress of the First Act.
The musical numbers will be listened to attentively, and those
which particularly take the fancy of the audience will call
forth a demand for encores, which the conductor, if he is wise,
will turn a deaf oar to as much as possible. To take every
encore means prolonging the performance to a late hour, and
when the fate of a piece is doubtful, a conclusion in good time
may often turn the balance of public opinion in a favourable
direction.

(Upon the programme, as a rule, you 'II find

liut, after all, it is the Second Act
On which the fortune of the play depends;

And when the members of the lengthy cast
Have come on, one by one, or two by two;
And when before the curtain there have passed
The authors, lyrists, and composers too,
Then, once again, the house is set astir
By the appearance of the Manager.
There, with a cheerful smile upon his face,
See in his glory how he stands alone,
His countenance revealing not a trace
Of all the past anxiety he 's known.
Sometimes the noisy audience beseech
That he will just vouchsafe to them a speech.
But by-and-bye they turn the footlights out,
And rapidly the crowd of people throngs
Into the street, with lots to talk about,
Some even humming snatches of the songs.
The critics hurry off at once to write
Any impressions they have formed that night.
So, all is over, saving the critiques
Which in to-morrow's papers will appear;
If they are fairly good, for many weeks
The box-office one hardly can get near,
And ev'ry other person that one meets
Explains that he 's been trying to lxx>k seats.
Then soon the touring companies go forth
Upon their travels all throughout the land;
And people, east and west, and south and north,
Will pay their money down with willing hand.
While striking posters, flaunted near and far,
All help to make the piece more popular.

Perchance it happens that you do not pay
Another visit to this merry show,
Till it has been before the public, say
For just about three hundred nights or so.
Then we '11 excuse you if you rub your eyes,
And gaze around you in a blank surprise.
The title of the piece remains, no doubt,
The characters are pretty much the same;
But if there 's little else you know about
I do not think that you are much to blame.
No wonder that it all should seem so strange,
For ev'rything has undergone a change.
New numbers have been added here and there,
New business, very probably new scenes;
New dresses, gorgeous beyond compare;
But, really, it is only by these means
That such a piece draws crowded houses for
Five hundred nights or, maybe, even more.
L'EXVOI.
Enough, O gentle reader! you and I
Have probed beneath the surface more or
less,
Seeking to flnd the wherefore and the why
Of things that are conducive to success.
Now let us bid adieu to all concerned,
Trusting that no ill-feeling wo have earned.
And if there is a moral to be traced
From any of the incidents I 've shown,
'Tis surely this; "Study the public taste,
Even although it may not be your own."
Thus fortune you may speedily amass,
And, " rincit omnia Varietas I"
THE END.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MOTOBIST (A NOVICE) HAS BEEN GIVING CHAIRMAN OF LOCAL URBAN COUNCIL A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF THE EASE WITH
WHICH A MOTOR-CAB CAN BE CONTROLLED WHEN TRAVELLING AT A HIGH 8PEED.
A SPORTSMAN'S NIGHTMARE.
[" This is one of the moat crowded weeks in the
Sportsman's Year."—Daily Paper.]
WITH his usual determination to keep
abrenst of every movement, and guide
the opinions of the public, Mr. Punch
directed his Sporting Representative to
keep an eye on, everything of interest to
the sportsman during the week that has
elapsed since our last issue. The effort
to be in so many places at once has
perhaps befogged the usually clear in-
tellect of his S. R.; or, possibly, the
occurrence of the First of April has had
an especially lamentable effect this year;
it is, at any rate, very difficult to make
out whether the Report which has
reached this office refers to the Boatrace
or the 'Varsity Sports, or the Liverpool
Grand National, or the International
Football Match or the Amateur Boxing
Championship. A determination to at-
tend them all, without forgetting golf or
billiards, is no doubt responsible for a
catholicity of descriptive verbiage which
does more credit to our representative's
all - round sportsmanship than to his
lucidity.
"Old Sol," writes our impassioned
friend, "was beaming in the zenith after
a laj-hion which at once proved^the truth
of the old adage that March1, comes in
like a goose and goes out like a gander.
The Liverpudlians and the Metropolitan
contingent were in great force. Few ticks
of the chronometer were cut to waste
as the row of equine candidates faced the
starter, and it was noted that the crack
was carrying even more bloom than when
last he was seen out, and despite a some-
what plain frontispiece looked all over a
gentleman of blood-like quality. But all
comments were hushed as the flag fell,
aud Cusliendun was seen to be the first to
break the line. The welkin, rang with
the shouts of " They 're off!" as the first
division topped the earlier obstacles, and
the second-raters began to show their
pretensions to belonging to the semi-dark
fraternity.
A smart piece of pedipulatiou soon
resulted in the clever Scotch forward
eluding the Southern custodian, and deftly
depositing the pilule between the uprights.
But hardly had the sphere begun to roll
once more, than a magnificent dribble on
the left wing took it right across the
carpet, and the champions of the Thistle
were soon embarrassed by the numerous
efforts made to enter their reticulated
stronghold. Not to be denied, however,
the hardy sons of the North soou gave the
beholders a taste of their quality, and
after tapping the Aston Villa representa-
tive smartly on the knowledge-box, the
"Heart of Midlothian " lad followed up his
advantage with a rasper in the commis-
sariat department that fairly doubled up
the Saxon, and the bout finished with a
considerable quantity of Badminton iu
full evidence from the damaged pro-
boscis.
All this time the boys in the Dark Blue
had been far from idle. Urging their
canvas craft forward with alacrity, they
proved themselves as slippery as their
best backers could desire. But Mr.
MUTTLKBURY'S darlings were far from
done with. Iu the diugdoug exchanges
which ensued each in turn paid a hurried
but involuntary visit to the boards, and
there was very little fiddling about for
an opening as the champions of the Isis
faced their opponents in the rough water
of Corney Reach. The dexter optic of
the Cambridge representative was by
this time assuming a decidedly swarthy
hue, but encouraged by the parboiled
aspect of his enemy's sinistral peeper,
he soon gave evidence of making the
effort of his life, and appeared to bo so
full of running that he must be classed
among the dangerous contingent for the
rest of his career.

:o show signs of serious trouble in a
mnker on the Surrey side, but extri-
'ating himself by the ingenious vise of a
liblick, he begun tearing through the
iqtiid element in a truly astonishing
manner. But all hope had not been aban-
doned as they passed the Soapworks, for
t was known that the leader had a tube
n his throat, and in the certainty of its
soon becoming a question of "bellows to
mend" in all directions, the Light Blues
made a terriflc bid for victory before
liarnes Bridge had been attained. Pass-
ing beneath that structure the timepieces
showed 32 immersions to the minute, and
many thought a double baulk must he the
only issue. Caution then marked the
further progress of the game, and after
carefully nursing the ivories at the busi-
ness end of the Green Board of Cloth,
the Oxonian gently dropped the straw-
berry globe into the right-hand pouch,
disappeared himself into a similar recep-
tacle, and left the pallid one in capital
position for continuing his break. When
they neared the Pavilion for the second
circuit of the cinders a hot exchange
ensued, and several organs in each com-
petitor were severely rattled up, but as
they swung into the straight with only
two more timbers to negotiate before
severing the judicial worsted, it was
seen that Barsac and Levanter had both
shot their bolt, and as soon as Mr
NUGENT asked the question Dmmcree
responded gamely, and hugging the rails
nil the way, managed to get hold of a
very accelerated pass from the outside
which was soon converted into a smasher
on the 'tater trap that did the business
for his game opponent was evidently deat
to the world soon afterwards, and all was
over bar the shouting. We hear the

trained octette. T. A. C.

of a deeply respected Puisne Judge, wh
wanted the pitch for himself.
That a certain Chancery Judge, seeing
that his horse must be beaten by that o
nn eminent K.C. practising in his owi
court, threatened to deprive the latter o
his costs in a big action pending unles
he allowed him, the learned Judge,:
win.
That it is not tho fact that any of the
Puisne Judges were reported by th
Htarter for disobedience at the post.
That the "disgraceful episode" give:
publicity below is utterly devoid o

ustices, jumping tho last fence side by
ide, "arranged" who should win, in the
ollowing terms :—
First L. J. Will you stand in a tenner

Second L. J. Can't do it, Cookie, under

First L. J. Is a pony any good to you?
Second L. ,7. Right, sonny. Qo on and
win, or I shall have to pull this beggar's
lead off in order to stop him!
That tho Lord Chief Justice was very
anxious to run a motor car in the first
race, but had to scratch it as he could
lot find a jockey.
That two of the riders—who were also
stewards—called each other before them-

each was severely reprimanded by the
other.

A SPORTING DEPUTY.
MY friend THUUSTER, who acts as hunt-
ing correspondent to a leading sporting
journal, -wrote, imploring me to run down
and "do" a lawn meet of the Haughty-
shire Foxhounds, on his behalf, as he had
been called away on urgent business.
"Make my house and stables your own,
dear boy. I know you have no literary
experience, but reporting a hunting run
is so simple that
you can't go
wrong," he wrote.
Of course I ac-
cepted, and Mon-
day saw me arrived

for the morrow's

my mount for tho
day. Bolted coffoe
and hurried out,
tripping over spur
and tearing right
boot badly with
rowel.
Groom touches
hat and looks dubi-
ously at my heels.
"Beg pardon, Sir,

divest myself of them, climb up into

my toe with his teeth, and twice trying

regards my mount with critical eye.
"You know this horse?" I enquired in

off to draw some small woods. Chestnut
kicked at, but mercifully missed, a hound.
M.F.H. swore at me, and huntsman looked
murderous. Entered wood, where my
horse immediately " took charge," grazing
my leg up against sundry tree trunks,
crushing hat over my eyes under the
branches, and generally enjoying himself
in his own weird way. Away went a fox

we tore over a big grass field, bounded by

promptly refused. Tried again, and found
myself in collision with hard riding

another refusal, galloped round to gate.

and fell into ditch, then out on to road,
along which we kept for a mile, across
grass fields without end, and (mercifully)
no necessity for jumping, as line of open

hunted slowly on for an hour, and lost.

AET IN THE DOLLS' HOUSE.
BY LITTLE QUEENIE.
§ 4.—About Defcorotion.
DEKORATION, I should explane for the benneflt of my younger
readers, menes painting and papering. The first may entale
some expence unless, like me, you are so forchunate as to have
a Papa who is an Artist or Arkitect. Then it needn't cost you so
much, as you have only to wate till he is out of his studeyo. I
got a pan of Crimson Lake and another of Ultrymorene that -way
•which -was suflshent to dekorate the front door of my dolls'
house and all the bannisters.
Papa said I bad picked out the two most expencive paints in
his box, which shows I have an eye for cullour.
For the Nursery or Bedroom I can reccomend either a nice
cool gambooge, or else a pale srimp pink. (You make srimp
pink by squedging a tube of Chinease white on to a pan of
carmine) Srimp pink always looks reffined, besides being
restful to the eye of a tired doll.
Some dekorators invaryably do all the woodwork of the
droin-room sky-blue, but this is comonplace and even hedge-
sparowegg blue is not such a culcherd cullour as it used to be
and is very trying to most dolls' complecshuna.
I did mine Nile Grene, but I forget how I made it, except
that there was Emerild Green in it and when Father asked
what had become of his emerild grene it was unforchunately
found to be mislade.
For the Dining-room you must have some warm ritch cullour
like Vandike Brown or Injian Bed, which is exacly the shade
of Anchovey Paste but tastes quite diferent.
For the Atticks you should imploy Vermillion or Royal Male
Bed which are quiet and yet chearful to live with.
Should none of your dear parents or relatives posess a paint-
box (which is scaresly creddible) you will have to use your own
paints or else buy some. I have seen dolls' houses dekorated
with those enamil paints they sell in tins (my Cousin JOSKFINE
did hers with them and made a most awfull mess of it) On the
hole I do not advise ennamils unless you are waring a pinnifore
that dosen't matter.
It is nedeless to say that Dekoration is an Art that cannot be
performed without the ade of brushes. These should be of the
very best quolity, and it is false ekonomy to use any but the
finest ('mull's hair. If as I before remarked you have an
artistic parent it ought to be esy to provide yourself with
sutable brushes. If not you must do the best you can with
penny ones.
§ 5.—About Papering.
This is a far more dificult problim than painting. It will
hardly be beloved, but there is not a single toyshop in London
where you can procure a cheap and really artistic wallpaper,
or any of any kind 1 Where they get the papers they put up
in dolls' houses I don't know, but the yare abbominations, and
no doll can hope to have a truly butiful, home with them on
her walls.
Now when I was redekorating my dollshouse, I ditermined
I wouldn't have any paper on my walls that hadn't got some
pritensions to artistic merrit.
Acordingly one day I went with SARA (my made) into an
upolsterer's shop in Oxford Street, where Mummy always
goes to, and I said, "Will you please show me some of your
latest desines for papers?"
So a gentleman who seemed rather tired and conternptious
invited me to sit upon an Art sofa and weeled out a large
frame full of spesimens of wall-papers, the size of scoolroom
maps, and turned them over for me to see, thinking all the
time of something else.
I think he didn't like them himself or expect me to, and I
didn't. I said they were all a little too large for my perposcs,
which they were—a lot.
He said lankwidly. "Of course, that would depend very
much on what your perposes were."
And I said my perposes were doing up my dolls' house in an
easthetic stile. So he advised me to try some other establish-
iniiit, and I did try severil, but all their paterns were much
too big and I allmost comenced to despare.
However, one day—and this will show you, my dear young
friends, that we should allways persivere in whatever we have
made our minds up to acomplish — one day, by a peice of
extrordnry good luck I came upon the very thing I wanted.
You will lauf when you hear how ecstremly simple it was,
and how esily I might have thought of it at first.
When my dear Mamma was married (which was before I was
born or even cristened) she received a quantity of weding
presents, some of which are still lingring on the upstares
mantlepeices. But amongst them was a set of most butifully
bound books with her monnigram outside.
Now I happened to pepe inside one day, not in the least
ecspecting to find anything usefull, when—what do you think ?—
I found to my intense delite that the inside was lined with a
dellicat pale pink and blue marbel patern which was just ideel
for a doll's best bedroom, and there were flyleves at both ends
just the same with no printing on them so they couldn't be
wanted realy. The vollumes were ten in number, which
furnished just enough (and a little over) for my requirements
and nothing could have looked pretier or in more perfect taste
when pasted up.
I was so pleased I ran down to ask Mummy to come up and
look, but she hapened to be too busy that afternoon.
Encuraged by this suxess I thurally serched all the books on
the shelves and found an abundence of papers to sellect from.
One which I can strongly reccomend had a charming design of
little ships and swans in pale sammon, and another, nearly as
good, was all over little Injian ladies neeling down and shooting
with bows and arows.
I think it is very nice and thoughtfull of the gentlemen who
write these luvly books to have them lined so prettily, and they
will come off quite esily by inserting a pennife and slitting
jently. I feel most gratefull.
Still I was not content, as I had set my heart on having a
Jappinese boodwor for my best doll, and mere wall paper was
too convenshonil for my perposes. So I hunted about, and
fancy what I found? Why, a great big bloting-book covered
with the most exqisite Chinease embroidered silk! Another of
dear Mummy's weding presents, and such a nice usefull one!
The silk striped off esier than paper, and there was just enough
of it, after cutting it to shape, to go all round the droin-room.
So now, my dear children, you see what may be done with s
little
******
P.S.—Since writing the above terible events have oenred!
Mummy hapened, for the first time since her maridge, to open
one of her weding present books in order to show a vissitor how
butifully they were bound.
After the vissitor had diparted Mother sent for me and we
had rather a panefnl interview together, and even dear Father
said severil very disagribble and unkind things to me. Next
they came upon the bloting-book—but I proffer to draw a vail
over this unplesant topic and will only say that I have allmost
lived on bread and water ever since!
So, my beluved young readers, unless you are happilly en-
dowed with parints who posess more understanding and sim-
pathy with their children's nedes than I alas can bost of, I 'm
afrade I must advise you to be sattisfide with the hijeous wall-
papers your dolls' house is sure to be provided with,
Your heartbroken and misunderstood little Friend,
QUEEN IE.
P. P. S.—They didn't make me take the papers down, though!

THE TOILER'S HOLIDAY.
[The strain of nearly seven weeks' continuous work in Parliament has
necessitated an Easter vacation just one-third of that period in length.]
THERE is a point at which the nervous tissue
Even of Statesmen -will incline to rot;
Work it too hard and, in the awful issue,
The man becomes a drivelling idiot.
Nature, that cannot overlook abuses
Of her divinely regulated laws,
Prom time to time arrests our mental juices,
And utters her inexorable " Pause!"
This is the reason why our Legislature,
After an almost unexampled strain,
Bowing to these unwritten rules of Nature,
Goes forth reluctantly to ease its brain.
And who will doubt that Britain's Great Elected,
Outworn by sacred Duty's daily stress,
By midnight travail visibly affected,
Have more than earned their Eastertide recess?
Oh, let no niggling criticism grudge them
This sole reward for services received;
Let not a crude examination judge them
Upon the actual results achieved!
Theirs is the maintenance of high tradition,
Of manners and of Parliamentary tact,
Labours that lack the joy of full fruition.
Attendant on a mere accomplished fact.
They know the need of pertinent enigmas,
Not to be gauged by what replies they yield;
They have the care of casting quiet stigmas
On soldiers, out of hearing, in the field.
Work such as this has left them scanty leisure
For executing more constructive feats;
Yet have they nearly passed one useful measure
Permitting Ministers to keep their scats.
The Housing of the Poor had been suggested
As urgent business calling for debate;
Perhaps when Parliament is nicely rested—
Meanwhile the Poor are with us; they can wait.
Some people hold a view of legislation
Which calmer thought refuses to admit;
They think the House exists to please the Nation!
The Nation, as a fact, exists for IT.
Happy the land that has the chance to cherish
Sin-ii stalwart champions of the common weal;
I trow she would not gladly see them perish
A sacriflce_to pure excess of zeal.
Two little weeks' repose! How paltry after
Some six of steady pressure on the brain!
A snatch of sleep, a trill of boyish laughter,
And then the stern relentless task again! O. S.
THE TRAMGIRT ISLAND.
THE Isle of Thanet has been given over to the Electric Koad
Car Company. The excursion vans will, in course of time,
probably vanish, as 'Arries and 'Arriets will in fine weather
patronise the "trams," preferring life in the open air, on the
upper deck of the "tram," to being temporarily, but swiftly,
carried in a covered-in carriage to their destination at Margate
or Birchington. The head-quarters of the new tram are, we
believe, at Ramsgatc, which may henceforth be known as
"Trams-gate." The line to be called "The Tramsgate, Car-
gate, and Switchington Line." Why not carry it on to Herne
Bay on the one side (and so, as 'Arry says, "Herno a hextry
sixpence"), and to Sandwich (for refreshment) on the other,
and complete the circle by running through the meadows to
Canterbury, and so "joining the flats "!
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
• First on tlie Antarctic Continent (NEWNES), is Captain BoRCHGRE-
VINK'S narrative of the Antarctic expedition which, at the
charges of Sir GEORGE NEXVNES, set forth in 1808. The enter-
prise of visiting the Antarctic seas and continent is not now.
Captain COOK sailed so far southward as to sight the great ice
barrier that forms the seaward boundary of the weird continent.
Other expeditious have steered due south with varying degree
of fresh discovery. It was left to Captain BORCHGREVINK and
his gallant crew of the Southern Cross to hoist the first flag that
ever waved over the ice-fields of the Antarctic continent. It
was, of course, the Union Jack. The object of the expedition
was to locate the magnetic Pole. This was achieved after
nearly two years of arduous, sometimes perilous, adventure,
lived through with sublime patience and dauntless courage.
The explorers, travelling the final stage by sledge, reached the
furthest point south yet trodden by foot of man. After reading
the Captain's vivid account of daily life and its surroundings
in and about latitude 78°, my Baronite cannot honestly recom-
mend the newly discovered land to the average emigrant. But
Science has greatly profited by the munificence of Sir GEORGE
NEWNES, the skill and courage of officers and crew of the
Southern Cross.
The Tragedy of a Pedigree, by HUGO AMES (GREENING & Co.,
LTD.), though a very readable novel, is a little disappointing.
Both title and the gruesome picture on the cover suggest a
story of weird surroundings; "instead of which," one is
plunged into Society's vortex. Trouble to find plot. There is
a mesalliance of the heir of an ancient family with a young
woman of vague lineage. Naturally, his indiscretion becomes
an uncomfortable fact when he falls in love with a lady of
high degree. The characters, however, are well sketched.
That of the hero's sister Elizabeth (yet another ELIZABETH !)
stands out with clear distinction. Ames at a success, of
course: but Ames without hitting " the gold."
The discontinuance of Annals of our Time was a serious loss
to those concerned with the study and chronicling of current
events. One or two inadequate attempts have been made to
fill up the gap. The most successful that has come my
Baronite's way is MORISON's Chronicle of the Year's News
compiled by Mr. GEORGE EYRE-TODD. It is not so minute in
detail as the original work; by way of compensation it is
very much cheaper. It will serve for all ordinary purposes,
and those who require fuller information on particular subjects
will find in it the preliminary information of dates and places.
The Politician's Handbook (VACHER) is described by its com-
piler, Mr. WHATES, as designed to furnish the governing,
literary, and commercial classes with the essential information
given in diplomatic correspondence, Parliamentary papers, new
treaties, reports of Royal Commissions and other documents
issued by the Government. It is an undertaking which involves
grinding hard work guided by skill and experience. These
conditions are fulfilled in the handy well-printed volume. It
preserves in convenient, accessible form the gist of the
political and commercial history of the year. Lest we forget,
here will be found the very text of documents marking the
progress of events in the Far East, in. South Africa and else-
where, during the first year of the new century. A full index
makes easy the hunt for items. THE BARON DE B.-W.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—When I was reading
my paper this morning in my customary
attitude, standing on my head, it oc-
curred to me that even at the last
moment I might be of some slight service
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I
have not had an opportunity—from cir-
cumstances not entirely under my con-
trol—of consulting my good friends, the
Emperor of China, the Man in the Moon,
the Director-in-Chief of the Aerial Tran-
sit Company from Mars to the Sun,
Limited, and other persons of undoubted
antiquity; so I am not armed with their
opinions.
But this is a matter of detail, and un-
worthy the attention of one who would
not strike to the ground with a marling
spike a British sailor without serious
provocation.
From what I have gathered from a
hurried perusal of the leading articles
of the daily papers, read backwards, in
such a manner that extremes meet, I
fear there is a good deal of objection to
the payment of taxes by so-called sane
people. Then why tax the so-called sane?
Surely this is injudicious treatment, and
not to be spoken of in the same day with
a shower bath or what is technically
known as a strait waistcoat.
I do not know that I make myself clearly
understood, as I am not accustomed to
public speaking, especially when the
Great Panjandrum, with the little button
on top, is jogging my elbow with a com-
plete edition of Dr. JOHNSON'S Dictionary.
But, there, let that pass, for you cannot
always settle your opponent with the
stroke of a patent umbrella stand—even
when no one is looking. All I would
suggest is that, if the sane object, why
not tax the insane? They at least would
pay up with every appearance of cheer-
fulness and unpremeditated satisfaction.
Yours, as king-in-chief of the universe,

ON BANK HOLIDAYS.
THE following paper will be read by Professor SNOOKS before
the Society of Antiquaries towards the end of the twenty-first
century:—
The institution of "Bank" holidays, which seem to have
become increasingly frequent during the last years of the
nineteenth century of our era, has long been a puzzle to the
historian. Considerable doubt prevails among antiquaries as
to the origin of the name by which they were known. The
general view is that, they were called "Bank" holidays
because on those days, to add to the general inconvenience of
holiday makers, no one could go to the bank. My friend
Professor BUGGINS, however, derives the name somewhat
differently. He is of opinion that they were styled "Bank"
holidays because the less reputable members of the community
spent them lying on banks at Hampstead and elsewhere in
various stages of intoxication. That this was a prominent
feature in the keeping of these holidays is unhappily beyond
question, and Professor BUQGINS'S view, therefore, deserves
serious consideration.
The learned Dr. JINKS, on the other hand, believes that the
word "Bank " is a corruption of "Blank," and that these days
were called " Blank " holidays because, owing to over-crowding
and other difficulties, it was not possible for any sane human
being to find anything to do on them. Contemporary descrip-
tions which have come down to us seem to bear out this view,
and it is easy to perceive that, if a whole community endeavours
to keep holiday on the same day, every train, place of amuse-
ment and seaside resort will be crowded with a perspiring mob
of hapless citizens, and the effort to obtain enjoyment and
relaxation will be necessarily futile. Professor BUGGINS, on the
other hand, has laboured to show that this difficulty is more
apparent than real. He imagines a smiling and contented
population wandering in leisurely fashion through the streets
of great cities looking into shop windows, admiring the beauti-
Ful objects displayed in them, and returning home in the
evening laden with ribbons and cheap jewellry. Dr. JINKS,
however, has proved that this view is not tenable. He has
shown that on these days no shops containing anything which
any rational person could wish to buy were allowed to remain
open, and that the streets presented the depressing spectacle
of long lines of shuttered windows, flanking pavements strewn
with orange peel and torn paper. If this picture be a correct
one it only makes the institution of these holidays more
inexplicable.
Dr. SMITHSQN has ingeniously argued that the true name of
these days was "Dank" holidays, and that they were so
called because it always rained on them. This he declares to
be the true explanation of the fact, if fact it be, that a con-
siderable section of the community usually spent them in an
uncomfortably crowded public house.
Professor DOBBS maintains that the whole idea of "Bank"
or "Blank" or "Dank" holidays, as commonly accepted,
is a myth. He points out, with a considerable show of reason,
that no country with a large population could ever have
dreamed of compelling all its citizens to keep holiday on the
same day. On the contrary, its great aim would have been to
induce people to take their holidays on different days. He
refuses to believe that any nation with a reputation for sanity
to keep up would select four or five Mondays in each year on
which to travel in over-crowded trains, visit over-crowded
museums and theatres, trample on one another's heels on
Hampstead Heath, and jostle one another in a frantic effort to
get inside the Crystal Palace. He declares that the whole
conception of general holidays of this kind had become
impossible at the end of the nineteeth century, and belongs
rather to the scantier populations of the seventeenth and
eighteenth. He further points out, with a fair show of reason,
that holidays which are universal lack the real charm of holi-
days. There is no luxury in leaving off work if everybody else
leaves off at the same time. The essence of a holiday is that
other people should be working while you are idling.
Nor is it credible, according to Professor DOBBS, that the
English nation should ever have been content to put up with
the gross discomfort which is said to have marked the celebra-
tion of these days. The pictures -which have come down to us
of the loafer and the respectable tradesman, the clerk and the
chimney sweep, pigging together in third-class carriages,
elbowing one another on Margate beach, and singing convivial
choruses at Epping, are clearly inaccurate and even absurd.
Among the humbler sections of the community, even more than
among the higher, class distinctions are strictly maintained,
and the respectable clerk or artizan who was only allowed to
keep holiday among a crowd of 'Arries would certainly prefer
to stop at home and read the newspaper. It has been objected
to this view that nations are not rational and that legislators
are stupid. That short-sighted philanthropists may easily
have imagined that they were conferring a boon on the com-
munity by giving everyone certain holidays during the year,
without troubling to ascertain how on earth they were going to
enjoy them. But Professor DOBBS refuses to accept this view,
and he points out that as we in this twenty-first century have
found no difficulty in ordaining that every employer shall allow
his employes a certain number of holidays a year, leaving it to
the parties themselves to settle on the dates most convenient
for taking them, our forefathers of the twentieth century must
have had the sense to demand and obtain similar freedom.
QUESTION TIME. — "One unaccustomed to Parliamentary
Practice " wants to know if the kitchen and restaurant business
of the House of Commons is always referred to as a " ' Joint'
Committee," and, if so, is it a '"Hot or Cold Joint' Com-
mittee," or a " ' Soup-Fish-aud-Joint' Committee "?

EASY CIRCUMSTANCES.
HAPPY tho poor man's lot to-day!
For he with riches' cares unhampered
May now, without a cent to pay,
With every luxury be pampered.
While rival dealers struggle still,
And each upon the other tramples,
"With patent foods his mouth they fill,
And deluge him with cocoa samples.
A halfpenny paper if he buys
A free insurance it provides him,
And on a sick-bed if he lies
"With generous advice it guides him.
If he through stress of poverty
No picture shows can be affording,
The choicest art in posters he
Can gaze upon on every hoarding.
Yes, these are happy days indeed!
When traders, keen and enterprising
The public cure, amuse, and feed
Gratis by way of advertising.
LOVE'S LITTLE LIABILITIES.
Short Stories with Sad Endings.
No. VI.—THE OTHER WOMAN.
IF it had been the subject of a modern
play it would have been called a triangular
affair. At the base were EUSTACE CHARD
and the woman he had wooed and almost
won, the woman who would have been Mrs.
CHARD but for the presence of the other
woman who frowned at the apex. Poor
CHARD, and he thought everything was
going so satisfactorily and smoothly for
him; and to be thus confronted, nay,
defied by this creature who threatened to
overturn all his plans for future happiness
with the one woman he really did cherish
a sincere affection for was a poignant
grief that threatened to shatter his very
reason. The outlook was about as gloomy
a one as EUSTACE had ever faced. He was
not naturally a coward, but scenes with
women unnerved him and to see his
MAI; mi;IK in a state of semi-collapse,
brought on by this woman's insolence and
unwarranted behaviour, was a spectacle
that entirely robbed him of his self-con-
trol.
He had been lolling limply against the
piano. His mind was confused, his limbs
inadequately fitted to support him under
distress, threatened momentarily to give
•way. He lurched into the centre of the
room, and asked blankly: "Where is
she?"
"In the next room," answered the
woman.
The man played nervously with his
watch chain. Already her faith in his
strength and manhood had evaporated.
She avoided his glance. Yet he knew he
dare not trust himself to go into the next
room. She saw his irresolution, and
offered to go herself.
The man wavered. It was his only
chance. Yet he had some compunction
against allowing MARJORIE to go to this
woman, and he made a feeble show of
resistance. But this was quickly beaten
down, and the man weakly acquiesced to
an interview between the two women.
Poor little MARJORIE, she had not antici-
pated episodes of this sort being intro-
duced into her married life. Perhaps her
view of matrimony was taken too much
from modern works of fiction, where ex-
perience seldom inspires the description.
Such a contingency would have been met
by less impressionable women in quite
an airy, matter-of-fact manner, but with
MARJORIE this was not the case. She
was disappointed, her illusions, when re-
vealing themselves as such, seemed to
bo lurking in the near future, and only
bearing their ghosts into the present as
samples of what was to come. Very
naturally the man was not torn by any
conflicting emotions as to future develop-
ments. He hated to think, that the
woman in the adjoining room should have
the slightest power to alter the course
he and MARJORIE had marked out for
themselves. But he knew too well she
had. He knew that by a few words she
could dispel his dream and separate him
and MARJORIE—perhaps for ever. And
it was this fact that galled him; that an
ill - educated, unprepossessing woman,
could ever be in a position to play fast
and loose with practically half of his
life. If ever there was an outward and
visible sign of the degeneracy of modern
times this was one. Moreover, he knew
that this case was a replica of thousands
of others, happening daily, and that such
women, as the one who engrossed his
thoughts had the power, and used it to
devastate the realms of a home life, such
as he and MARJORIE had proposed to
enter on.
The man groaned. "After all," he said
in a broken voice, "yours is the best
way." MARJORIE'S face was touched with
a deep pity. She saw how genuinely
ashamed he was of his weakness.
"Go to her," he continued. "Toll her
of our plans for the future—as [much of
our life as you think fit and necessary.
Tell her how much of our happiness, our
hopes of peace and comfort depend on her
—good sense, her reasonable attitude, her
kind forbearance. Make her understand.''
The door opened and closed. The man
waited anxiously. He could hear the
buzz of their voices. How harsh, almost
raucous, tho woman's voice sounded to
MARJORIE'S richly modulated tones. The
sounds ceased. MARJORiEwas returning.
The door was flung open and the woman
who was to have been EUSTACE CHARD'S
wife, sank dejectedly into a chair.
"Speak, speak!" cried CHARD. "All
my hopes of future happiness depend on
your word. What did she say?"
"She said," sobbed out the distressed
MARJORIE, "She 's-bl-blowed if she '11 be
anybody's cook in a fifty-pound-a-yearflat
—oh, EUSTACE, don't hope. It "s impos-
sible. There can be no love where there
is no cook!"
THE CURE FOR INSOMNIA.
Ol' course everyone knows it. The
simplest thing in the world. All you have
to do is to fancy that you are counting a
flock of sheep crossing a stile.
You try it. There's the stile, close to
a tree, and near a cottage. Girl looking
out of window. Boy comes over stile and
makes an ugly face at girl. Girl takes an
umbrella and chivies boy. Stop! stop!—
this is getting interesting. Besides, has
nothing to do with the flock of sheep.
Going back. Leave cottage, boy, and
girl, and scrimmage, and return to stile.
Stile in foreground. Sheep approaching.
One sheep with a bell gets half over and
sticks. Dog barks, but does not do any
good. Wedding-party come up. Rustic
bride much distressed at not being able
to pass the stile. Bad omen. Rustic
bridegroom indignant with shepherd.
Row. Wedding guests take different
sides. Some of them personal friends
of the shepherd. Rural constable ap-
proaches. Row subsides. But heated
argument. Most interesting. But this
is not helping me to go to sleep. Never
more wide awake in my life!
Try back to tho stile. Fresh flock of
sheep. Here they come. One gets over,
then another, then a third. But, hallo!
What's this? Here comes a bull. How
the sheep scamper 1 And now the dog is
fighting the bull! And here comes a lot
of Volunteers. Why, they are lining the
hedges! It's a sham fight. Lord ROBERTS,
as I live, and Sir EVELYN WOOD. But I
didn't want to think of these eminent
warriors. I am more awake than ever.
Must get] Lback to my stile, pur «t
simple.
Same old stile. New flock of sheep.
They are in single file. Four of them get
over and I am expecting a fifth, when,
what is this? Why, the cottage is on
flre 1 Here come the engines! They pass
rapidly, getting up steam en route. And
here are the fire-escapes! What a mob!
The water is beginning to take effect!
The sheep are scrambling away in the
distance! The boy is trying to save the
girl 1 He clambers up the ladder of the
fire-escape! Saved! Saved! Here come
more fire-engines! The stile is broken
down to allow them to pass! Dear me!
I am more awake than ever! And my
sheep and stile both gone!
Try another remedy. Open presenta-
tion copy of a book by a valued friend.
Read a couple of pages. Rather dull.
Not quite sure—gork! gawk! gork—awk!

Mr. Tipcat. I am really at my wits' end.
I have cut down all the contributors to

hundred pounds' worth of jewellery every
week, and also, as you know, two motor
cars, fifty bicycles, and five-and-twenty
thousand copies of Pinnocfe's History of

some free luncheon tickets and a few
cases of champagne and whiskey, or buy
the favourite for the Derby and give him
to the person who spots the most con-
sonants in a certain number of the paper.
Proprietor (drill/). I know who that

Mr. Tipcat (suddenly struck bija brilliant
idea). Novel idea! "Novel" idea! That's
it! You 've just hit it! We '11 offer £500

AN INVITATION.
FAIR butterflies, that in the Park
Hither and thither flit and flutter,
The while your gorgeous hues I mark
In ecstasy the wish I utter:
"Would you would come in myriads here,
Our eyes to gladden and to cheer."
Come, hover round each lovely flower,
Its pollen browse, sip from its petals,
And we will make for you a bower
All overgrown with toothsome nettles,
Where you may spend your glad spring
days,
While we in admiration gaze.
Oh, foolish wish of ours! for now
Your children come, a loathly lot,
And swarm and creep on every bough,
For, butterfly, I quite forgot,
That, ere to beauty forth you burst,
You were a caterpillar first.

AFTER BANK HOLIDAY.
(A Few Confessions.)
Lightning Tourist. Got over 5,000 miles
or was it 50,000? I am quite sure we
visited Paris. Forget whether we saw
the Rhine or Switzerland, or both. Any-
way, we carried out the programme and
didn't waste a penny. It was certainly
cheap, and if my impressions are slightly
raised — well, I can find out
where we did go and read the
guide-book.
Enthusiastic Volunteer. Splen-
did time! Up at flve, on parade
at six. Hard at work until six
in the evening. Then mess.
Slept most of the time. Turned
in at seven; out again at flve,
and repeated the movement.
Not a moment to myself. De-
lightful holiday, and after my
work in the office a splendid
rest!
Typical 'Arry. Oh, dear!
Never see such fun. Fifty of
us in a compartment built for
ten. Such songs, such games,
and came back without being
copped by the police. First
rate, and no error!
Lgisurely Lounger. Never
think of going away when
other fellows go. Prefer the
club empty. Get my own cor-
ner in the coffee-room without
opposition. If I go to an hotel
on Bank Holiday, always full.
Like to be looked after. Hate
to be si number. Bank Holiday
first-rate institution — when
you stay at home.
Amusement Caterer. Splen-
did houses; cram full on Mon-
day. Up all night looking after
things. Rushed up the balance
at the Bank. Not much rest
for me; but, then, I always
have the hardest work on a
holiday.
Cabinet Minister. Left in
town to look after everything!
Half a mind to serve my col-
leagues out by causing foreign
and colonial complications.

good of being a Right Honourable if you
don't behave as such?

FOR LOVE OF SCIATICA.
(An Hydropathic Romance.)
SCIATICA was not beautiful, nor was
she young, and yet, no sooner had Mr.
ROOMER TISM exchanged a dozen words
with her than he fell desperately in love.
They met in the Pump Room, whither
a gouty destiny had impelled them.
ROOMER waxed eloquent on sulphates;
SCIATICA flashed out with apo-
thegms on carbonates. A
secret affinity of the problem
on diuretics drew these two
middle-aged souls together, and
they walked back to the hydro
thrilling with the thought that
Nature had given each a similar
diathesis. Later on, as they
stirred weak tea sweetened
by saxin, they compared with
feverish interest their diet
charts, and tears of exquisite
sympathy fell from SCIATICA'S
eyes when she found that Mr.
ROOMER TISM also was told to
avoid pork chops and bottled
beer.
We were designed for each
other, murmuredRooJlEn, bend-
ing as much as tendency to
lumbago would permit.
SCIATICA blushed and bash-
fully turned the subject on to
the clinical significance of
gastric toxins.
That evening she confided
to her cousin ARTHRITIS the
news of the mutual attachment,
while ROOMER, as he drank his
glass of hot water before
retiring to rest, silently
pledged his love.
Of course, a few shadows
chequered from time to time
the sunshine of the romance.
The course of true love never,
etc., as the poet says, and
when the course is a "water"
course, tho sentiment has
additional application. But
then the tiffs were no ordinary
lovers' tiffs. O ' dear no!
nothing so foolish and trivial.
SCIATICA had a weakness for
carbo-hydrates which ROOMER TISM did
not share, and she resented his mild
reproaches on this score. But he made a
peace offering of takadiastase (in 5-grain
doses) tied up with blue ribbon, and all
was right again. The wedding will shortly
take place: a peptonised wedding-cake is
being prepared by a first-class chemical
firm, and the health of bride and bride-
groom will be drunk in fine old Vichy
water. It is understood that the bride-
groom has presented the bride with a neck-
lace and pendants composed of varalettes.
Tho honeymoon will be divided between
tho various English spas.

THE USES OF ADVERTISEMENT.
Shade of Milton speaks:

To all the world explained

Else haply had my verses raised
Almost as great a noise
As this unread but much self-praised

Paradise Lost no better fared:
No advertising page
This masterpiece of mine declared
The marvel of the age.

Of these who now possess
The courage and the face to puff
Peccavi in the press.
I wrote of Satan, but no " ad."
My genius proclaimed—
If BEELZEBUB I only had

No bold announcement bade men look
For Lycidas, but then
No royal life was my poor book
Writ by a ducal pen.
My foolish thoughts, all out of joint,
On art alono were bent,
And quite ignored the vital point
Of self-advertisement.
I wrote an Epic, and it stocked
My purse with guineas five—
These wiser moderns just concoct
Advertisements, and thrive.
FOR FOREIGNERS IN LONDON AT
EASTER.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I see that several
excellent schemes have been arranged for
English, strangers visiting the Continent
at Easter, to enable them to see the chief
objects of interest in foreign parts. For
instance, in Paris an itinerary allows
tourists to inspect the Place de la Con-
corde, the Boulevards.the Arc de Triomphe,
and the Morgue. Now, could not some-
thing bo done of the same kind for French-
men visiting London at this season of the
year for the first time? I think so. I jot
down a programme for three days.
First Day. Visit to Charing Cross.
Inspection of the statue of CHARLES I.
Visit to Charing Cross railway station.
Inspection of the exterior of the Royal
United Service Institution. Walk in St.
James's Park. Lunch. A substantial one
can be obtained at the A.B.C. shops.
Promenade down the Victoria Embank-
ment, with visits to tho bridges of
Westminster, Charing Cross (foot>path),
Waterloo, and Blackfriars. Home.
Second Day. Visit to the Tottenham
Court Road. Inspection of huge shops.
Journeys by the Twopenny Tube to the
extent of 8d. Lunch at the A.B.C. Visit
to Battorsea Park. Inspection of the
British Museum. Walks to and fro of the
most interesting character. Journey to
King's Cross. Inspection of railway
platform. Home.
Third Day.—Visit to the Docks. After
they have been inspected, journey to Kew
Gardens. Charming walk by Knights-
bridge, Kensington, and Hammersmith.
Lunch at the A.B.C. The rest of the time
might be usefully employed in resting on
the benches on the Thames Embankment,
and packing up. Train leaves for the
Continent at a time that carefully avoids
clashing with the dinner hour.
There, my dear Mr. Punch, if that is not
an excellent programme I am a Dutchman.
I have found no exact balance to the
Morgue. Some suggest, however, that
the School of Mines, in Jermyn Street, is
sufficiently gloomy to be accepted by the
more cheerful of our visitors as a satis-
factory substitute.
Yours very truly,
ORGANISER.

A DANCE DIALOGUE.
"A SMARTISH affair this," I said to the
little man with the pale-blue eyes, who
leant disconsolately against the wall.
He laughed nervously. I felt drawn
to him, somehow. He appeared to know
no one, and I knew very few intimately,
and hadn't succeeded yet in discovering
the host and hostess.
"But I should say," I went on,drawing
inspiration from my new acquaintance's
sympathetic attention, "I should say it
cost our host Sir TUMNAL TINTZ a pretty
penny. Tho champagne is actually up to
par, ahd no stint."
"Really, I "m glad to hear you say so."
"Reassuring, isn't it?"
From our point of vantage we could
command a full view of the ball-room.
The melody of the waltz, the perfume,
and tho frou-frou of Parisian and Viennese
confections had lulled the little man into
a delicious reverie.
"There," I said, " you see that old chap
who looks as if he had stolen the Eastern
Hemisphere and put it under his waistcoat
—that explains the fizz!"
My friend looked exceedingly puzzled.
"That's GOOTZEGOO — the chap who
supplied the wine. Oh, everybody knows
Sir TUMNAL runs things a bit above his
income. Lady TINTZ has social ambitions.
What's the consequence? Bills are paid
by invitations to meet all the exclusive
and celebrated, instead of by coin of the
realm. GOOTZEGOG accepted with pleasure
—on the back of a receipted bill for six
dozen 'bottles of the boy.'"
"Really, this is exceedingly unpl"
"Social sins," I said. "You'll know
them all by heart by and bye. It's only
a question of time. Now, you see that
woman hop-waltzing. There, just passed
us, high-pitched voice, pearls"
"Yes, yes, but"
"That is Mrs. GRINBUROER, kuowu in
Chatham Street as JULIETTE & CIE., swag-
ger dressmakers, where Lady TINTZ can
make up her betting-book, aud hedge—
by patronising the GRINBUROER."
"Upon my word I " in astonishment.
"Scandalous having to meet these
people. And that thin woman bare-ly
clothed—ha! ha ! excuse my little quip."
"I know"
"Mdlle. SEMBRACH—bonnets; supplies
the TINTZ girls with headgear, and is
allowed to pass as a friend of the family
because she forgets to send in the bill.
Convenient, isn't it? She looks like mak-
ing a match—or a breach of promise"
"It is incredible," almost vociferated
my little friend, whose eyes I was evi-
dently opening as to the ways and means
of a certain, or rather uncertain, class
of society. "It is incredible," he said,
"that you should tell me all these
scandalous tales in the house where you
are privileged"
"Quite so, quite so," I said, fearing I
may have wounded his sensibilities. "One
only does this sort of thing when the
function is a fizzle. But you appeared to
know no one."
"You appear to know everyone"
"A good many. Come, let us have a
stroll round and try and find the host."
The little man blinked nervously.
"Have you any idea what the Johnny's
like?" I enquired.
"Exactly like me," said the little man.
"I am Sir TUMNAL TINTZ 1"
CHART OF THE COMING WEATHER.
(Accuracy Guaranteed—More or Less.)
SUNSHINE mingled with snow and sleet.
Wind veering round from north to east,
and then by south to west. Thunder in
places, with showers and light breezes.
Change at Paris, Folkestone, Reading, aud
the North of Scotland. Blizzard moving
from America across the Atlantic. Smooth
to half a gale on the Channel. Squalls
on the North Sea, and a hurricane at
Putney. Fog at Blackheath. Unreliable
weather in the Bay of Biscay.
Suitable costume for the month, flannel
suit lined with fur, and pith helmet
swathed in flannel. Sunshine two hours to
the forty-eight, and seven inches of raia
to the square foot in places.

A CURIOUS COURTSHIP.
PERSONAE.
Blanche Alder (21). Enid Forsyth (30).
Freddy Alder (16). Cecil Carington (28).
SCENE–A bright little Drawing-room in Mayfair. BLANCHE
ALDER, who is the only daughter of a fascinating widower,
is surrounded by floral tributes and other presents in honour
of her twenty-first birthday. She is slim and fair, with an
appearance of wilful airiness. On a table near her is a large
framed photograph of a young man, looking pale but deter-
mined, on a background of vague landscape. She is reading
to herself a telegram that runs as follows :-
“It is better I should never see you again. Better so perfect
an ideal should remain a vision. Only, should we see more of
each other, it might lead to anguish and despair for me. Do
not even answer this; it is better so. Good-bye. Reply paid.
CECIL CARINGTON, Victoria Street.”
Footman (announcing). Mrs. Forsyth.
Enter BLANCHE's greatest friend. She is tall, dark and
handsome, and tries, unsuccessfully, to conceal under
the grace of a perfect hostess and the cordiality of
a charming guest the well-known fact that she is
still in love with her own husband.
Blanche (hiding the telegram). Oh, how are you, darling 2
Enid (taking off her furs, with a quick glance round). What is
the matter, BLANCHE 2 Is anything wrong 2
Blanche. I am rather worried, dear. Can I trust you ?
Enid (reproachfully). Oh, BLANCHE I
Blanche (apologetically). It's such a great secret, dear!—
About my brother—poor little FREDDY — you know. He's
spending the holidays with Uncle SAVILE. He wants to marry.
He wants to marry CARRIE FLOYD—and has asked me to lend
him fifteen shillings.
Enid. Is that enough to marry on ?
Blanche. Oh, of course not! But he says that doesn’t matter.
She has such a splendid salary at the Tiv–where she sings,
you know—Classical concerts. Besides, dear, think I She is
married already, and has six children. And, then, the disparity
of age : She is forty-six, and he is sixteen. He says he
knows all that—he isn't blind to the facts—but it's real love,
the sort of thing you read of in books—
Enid. Or newspapers.
Blanche. Yes—and he can't live without her.
Papa will— And such a difference in age l’’
Enid. I think nothing of that. It is often done nowadays.
But if she is married already there seems no danger of its
coming off, so I can't sympathise very much.
Blanche. Darling ENID ! How sensible and soothing you
always are

Blanche. Very nearly.

Enid. And, of course, you didn't appreciate it.
you care for diamonds !
Blanche. They last so long !
Enid. You would give all your jewels for a mass of gardenias.
And who sent the gardenias and orchids 2
Blanche. Young REEVEs. He thinks I am a heartless, sophis-
ticated woman of the world, and disapproves of me; but says
I have a morbid attraction for him. The rosebuds are from
old Mr. Coulston. He says I’m so refreshingly simple and
innocent, it's quite a treat to meet that sort of girl nowadays.
And he begins a long letter—a sort of patronising proposal—
with “My dear Young Lady, May an old friend of the family
venture,” and so on—you know the kind of thing. Isn't it
funny, to be so different with different people? And how can
one help it? I suppose it's the point of view.
Oh, think how
It was Papa who gave me this
How little
Enid. And the attitude. Is that a new photograph of
ARTHUR 2. It's rather flattered.
Blanche. Ah, you see, he took it himself. And he photo-
graphs so well—too well ! He does everything so well. I
think that 's what I don't like about him.
Enid. I can't imagine, BLANCHE, why you don't marry him
and — and get it over ! He has everything in the world.
You'll never meet anyone nicer. You've been followed about
for the most absurd length of time by these three admirers—
old Mr. Coulston, BoBBY REEVEs and ARTHUR-and it's time
you decided. It would be such a relief to my mind! I'm
always afraid you'll do something idiotic—I meant original,
but it's the same thing. Do marry ARTHUR-please !
Blanche. Oh, I can't ' He's too suitable !
Enid. Rubbish : Besides, if that's an objection, he probably
won't remain suitable. No, I won't argue on those grounds,
and I won't listen to such nonsense. He's handsome, enor-
mously rich, will have a pretty name someday—he'll be Lord
LYNNESEDE, won't he?—and is the best fellow in the world. Also,
so well-balanced and the right age. Just what you needſ
The very person 1
Blanche. Please don't be irritating, ENID; and it's no use
saying more, because I can't—I mean, I couldn't—if I wanted
to. First, I said I wouldn't marry him, and now he's turned
round, rather rudely, and said, “All right then, I won't marry
iſou. So there !”
Enid. Really, BLANCHE 2
Blanche. Yes, dear. Here's his letter. (Reads.) “After
what passed last evening, I beg to relinquish for ever the
honour to which I have been aspiring so long. You know that
I went to that dinner on purpose for a word with you, and
you ignored me and spent the entire evening with a perfect
stranger. I most sincerely hope you may be happy, though I
own that, with your surroundings and disposition, I have
grave fears to the contrary. And as I leave England to-
morrow, you will be no longer troubled by my importunities.”
And so on—you know the sort of thing. Horribly rude and
cross |
Enid. What have you been doing—and where's the poor boy
going to hide his bruised heart?
Blanche. At Monte Carlo. He was going, anyhow.
Enid. And when did this happen?
Blanche (beaming wistfully). I met him for the first time last
night. He was a perfect stranger A curious, interesting
man, very different from-. Oh, don't look so regretful,
ENID | ARTHUR's high principles, violent temper and fondness
for playing halma would have led to trouble between us—I
know it. Now CECIL CARINGTON.—I’m not sure I like him,
though.
Enid. I am quite sure you do–to–day. What did he say to
you?
Blanche. Oh, let me see. He said he would like to burn me,
like spice, on the altar of a devoted friendship !
Enid. A strong statement. What did he mean?
Blanche. I’ve no idea. He thinks we met in a previous
existence—he remembers it. He has a wonderful memory.
Well, it's only about two or three thousand years ago, I
suppose. It's a pity I shan’t see him again.
Enid. Shan’t you ? (She seems gratified, but sceptical.)
Blanche. Well — not after this afternoon. Now, ENID,
don't look like that. I did not ask him to call. I thought,
perhaps, he might ask to, but he didn't. He said he preferred
our meeting should be like a dream to look back on, an isolated,
golden spot in his memory, or something, and of course I agreed
with him. Oh, here's his telegram. (Reads telegram.) “It is
better I should never see you again ; better—so perfect,” and
so on—you know the kind of thing. “Do not even answer this;
it is better so. Reply paid.—CECIL CARINGTON, Victoria
Street.'"
Enid. And what did you answer?

APRIL SHOWERS!
OR, A SPURT HOME.
THE CENSUS AND AFTER.
DKAR MR. PUNCH,—I am reluctant to trouble you with the
story of my grievance, but with a view to making the period
between census to census longer than at present fixed I ven-
ture to address you. I must confess that my experience of
taking the necessary particulars of my household is anything
rather than a pleasant one. I jot down a few facts in support
of my proposal that in future the census should be taken every
fifty years instead of the customary shorter interval. I do not
wish to attack that much-abused relative, the mother-in-law—
who, by-the-way, is a far more formidable personage on the
Continent than in England—but what can we do when the lady
in question, who has been staying with us for years, insists that
she is six months younger than
her own daughter?
Then, it is really highly in-
convenient when one's cook
grows frightened at the sight
of the official paper and takes to
excessive drinking to nerve
herself to answer your ques-
tions. This excessive drinking
renders her replies of no value
as evidence, and, moreover,
sadly interferes with the com-
fort of one's dinner. Pickles
should not be put in bisque
<r/iomnrd,and turbot should not
be covered with apple sauce.
Then the boys should not call
the census "rot," and insist
upon with drawing to Paris to
avoid the nuisance of answering
your queries. Of course it is
only an excuse to get what they
term " a tenner a-piece out of
the pater," but still in these
hard times the demand is incon-
venient.
Then there Ss another matter
that may cause annoyance. Say that a room supposed to be
reserved for "lumber" has been occupied by the dressmaker, to
whom you object, and her presence is discovered on the day fixed
for the taking of the census. How is she to be entered on your
list when she asserts she has never slept a wink, and has been
working all night?
Lastly, when you have taken infinite pains to do your duty as
a patriotic citizen, it is not only annoying but embarrassing to
find—when the official calls for your paper—that your census
statement has been torn up by your wife and the pieces used
as fuel for the fire in the dining-room.
All these accidents have happened to me recently, and such
being the case, I consider that I may lay myself open to a
charge of sarcasm, when I sign myself (using the official
designation), Yours truly, THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD.
HAMLET THE CORRECT CARD I—The now favourite game at cards
yclept" Bridge " has obtruded itself on SHAKSPEARE. Mr. BENSON
advertises his Hamlet as "a-bridge'd version." Is Hamlet
the Knave of Clubs? Shall the fascinating King of Hearts, or
the frowning Sovereign of Spades be the false Uncle Claudius?

Attatie Turkey, describes how Judges of the
Turkish Empire have their impartiality and in-
corruptibility assured by a salary of £2 10«. a
month."-Sf. Jauun's Gazette.}
THRICE happy Turk! the gentle sway
Of kindly Caliphs you obey,
Who golden tribute renp;
While righteous laws their realm adorn
That trickle from the Golden Horn,
And justice is so cheap.
We Englishmen, albeit free,
Brief barristers with heavy fee,
And lordly stipends pay
To judge and magistrate, while still
Your benches you contrive to fill
At half-a-crown a day.
Yet what if rumours may be true
That whisper how there falls to you
Stray perquisites beside;
That when the suitors' bones are bare
Judge WOLF contents him as his share
With carcass, wool, and hide?
Ah! then, if even at the rate
Of half-a-crown a day, your State
Of Judges finds no dearth,
'Tis possible that, after all,
The stipend, though extremely small,
Is fully what they 're worth.
"PATRIE!"
IF you are fond of a good old tragic
melodrama, and if you are in Paris, go and
see SARDOU'8 Patrie! revived at the
Theatre Francais. It is a cheerful drama.
M. MOUNBT-SULLY, as the Comtede Ryaooi;
a dignified gentleman a little past middle
age, with a neatly-trimmed grey beard
and large eyes—somewhat resembling the
KING OF ENGLAND—is chiefly occupied in
ejaculating "Patrie/" This becomes,
naturally enough, so monotonous to the
southern temperament of his Spanish wife
that she fixes her affections on another
Flemish gentleman, who says less and does
more. For he not only conspires against
the lives of his Spanish enemies, but also
against the happiness of his Flemish
friend, and by degrees he gets in such a
muddle with his varied schemes that, as
the only way out of the difficulty, he begs
the Comte de fij/soor to kill him. But the
Comte—remarking, as usual, "Patrie 1"
—refuses.
Then the conspirators are caught by the
Duke of Alva in the Town Hall of Brussels,
and the fun begins. The Spaniards shoot
a patriotic and self-sacrificing bell-ringer.
They burn some patriotic conspirators.
They are about to torture the Comte de
Rysoor, but he escapes by committing
suicide, his last word being, of course,
"Patrie!" The Duke of Alva's daughter,
who, one would suppose, must have been
accustomed to massacres, is scared to
death by the anticipation of one, and the
VOL. CXJC.
Comtesne de Rysoor is stabbed by her lover,
who throws himself from the window oti
to the paving below. The paving of the
Grand' Place at Brussels is to this day
hard and unyielding.
So the play has to come to an end, for
there is no one left alive but the Duke of
Alwi and the supers, and one concludes
that the former has been busy slaughter-
ing as many of the latter as possible
behind the scenes during the last act. It
is an exhilarating drama.
It is put upon the stage in the most
sumptuous manner. The scenery, the
furniture, the dresses and the processions

are superb. And you can see them all
from any part of the stalls, for the
Com&lie Francaise has made a rule—an
admirable innovation in a French theatre
—that ladies are not admitted in hats or
bonnets. As almost all the men are now
in evening dress, the audience in the
stalls is quite elegant.
The theatre has been well restored
since the fire, but, curiously enough, the
precautions against this very calamity
seom incomplete. The gangways are still
lined with strapontins, fitted with springs
so strong that in closing they would in-
fallibly catch the dresses of ladies in a
panic-stricken audience, and told them
immovable. But even if the women es-
caped the strapontins, they could never
pass the two pairs of very narrow doors
at each exit. The springs closing these
are so strong that it is almost impossible
to hold the doors open.
However, whatever might happen, there
would be one consolation. The statue of
VOLTAIRE in the foyer, being now provided
with wheels concealed in the pedestal,
would in any case be saved. H. D. B.

ART IN THE DOLLS' HOUSE.
BY LITTLE QUEENIE.
§ C.—About Fernishing.
IN fernishing the most importent thing to mind is that it
must be thurally artistic. It dosen't mater nerely so much if it
is not quite comfitable to sit on. Grownups who have got
culcher would far rather sit on a chare or sofa which is all
right and a genuine Sherriton than lunge on a couch which is
only ininiihiiii.il sadlebogs. And dolls are less particular
about comfit than grownups are, because they hardly ever sit
down realy.
So do be carefull to chuse only things that are butiful in
themselves, rejecting enny peice of fernicher that is not a good
desine—for bad and ugly objects are more demorillising than
you would supose. FILLIS ANDERSON'S dolls' house is full of
such, and her gentleman doll wares a check suit with gilt butons
and an emerild grene tie, and you can't tell which are the
ladies from the servants!
I am afrade it is allmost impossible to proccure any jenuine
old Chipindale or Sherriton the exact size for a dolls' house,
because I cannot assertain that any were ever made. In those
benited days it was considered that anything was good enough
for dolls.
But Mr. BRANSAWDER (at the Spotid Roking Horse, Number
999, Oxford Street) has the most luvly fernicher, all coppied by
his own desiners from the Arts and Crafts Exhibition.
Mr. BRANSAWDER is a very nice and clever gentleman, who
took to selling toys because he could not get on as a barister,
and I can asure my young readers that, if they go to him and
menshun that they were reccomended by LITTLE QUEENIE, they will
recieve his best atenshun. He told me to say that his own self.
We will comence with the droin-room: Let no one pursuade
you to buy one of those horid "sets" with detestible fringes
round the chares and sofa, like the ends of crakers. You are
sure not to like them, and they are the sine of a medioker mind.
Far better buy each artikle sepparate, and witli some
indijuality in it. This may cost more, but, as Mr. BRANSAWDER
says, it is far cheaper in the long run.
He has some realy luvly Umpire sofas upolstered in Utreck
velvet for only seven and sixpence. With one of these and two
esy chares at five .shillings cuvered in Art Chints and an
ocasional table or two, you will have the newclius of a
charmingly fernished room.
A Queen Ann fireplace and qvermantle (which you will also
find at Mr. BRANSAWDEU'S) are de rigure. For the curtins I
always advise real lace and it cannot be too good. Mine came
off one of Auntie WINNIE'S pokct-hankerchifs which she droped
and is old Valansiaus, but those of my readers who have 1101
got an Auntie WINNIE or whose Auntie WINNIE has not got a
lace pocket-hanky must look elsewhere. I have often though
that some of the triming round Mummy's dressing-table woulc
not come in badly for the droin-room curtins of my doll's houst
—but I have not sujested it to her.
Perhaps some day a dear old lady may come to dinner witl
your Papa and Mama with lappits of real Brusels or Hnnnytor
over her head, and then if you should hapen to be provided witl
scisors and choose a time when nobody is nottising . . . but
have sajd enough to show you that it is your own fault if you
are content to put up with iuimitoshuns.
§ 7.—About Orniments and Niknaks.
Without these no droin-room is complete. Mr. BRANSAWDER
has a very fine sellection. I quite fell in love with two littl
gilt-bronse stattuets of cavileers which were abserdly cheap a
only five shillings the pare. Mr. BRANSAWDER very kindlj
begged me to axcept them. He is a particlerly plesant person
You ought to have plenty of flowers about the room. Thej
don't smell but give an air of refinement, and Mr. BRANSAWDER
has some elligant little tables with a pot of jerauiums on them
which were made in Germany, which acounts for their being
inly half-a-crown.
The week point of the ordinery doll's house is the pictuers
which are mostly cromos, but I found some quite wee water-
ullours in one of dear Papa's allbums which REGGIE framed for
me and they are a constant joy. Papa has a very old book, too,
with funny writing and gorjious ilustrashuns on gold. One of
hem would do splendidly over the droin-room sofa of my doll's-
louse for an Old Master, or else a Burnjones, but they are all
so pretty I can't make up my mind which to cut out though I
mow my dear Papa wouldn't mind my taking just one for so
;ood an object.
I will now procede to anser my young corispondents :—
DORA B.—I am truly sorry for you with a coalskutle in your
lining-room which, from what you say of it, must be a purject
eyesoar. You might go and look at Mr. BRANSAWDEU'S Art
coalskutles, 999, Oxford Street. They are too sweet. I forget
the exact price—but Mr. BRANSAWDER could tell you.
PROBORA.—(1) If your Brother TOMMY will insist on billyting
!x>rd ROBBERTS and ten Black Watch Highlanders in your dolls'
louse nursery and comandearing the shourbath for a look-out,
! should put all thefcighlanders carefully back in their box when
IB wasn't looking—but not Lord ROBBERTS, because he is a
freat hero and should be regarded (even on horseback) in the
ight of an honored gest.
(2) Yes, it is tyrany of TOMMY to declare that the nursery is
under marshal law.
PURPLEXT.—You ask me how you can best butify the interior
of your dollhouse with the five shillings given you by your
Uncle GEORGE. Why not pay a visit to The Spoted Roking-
tiorse, 999, Oxford Street, and inspect some of the novelties
Mr. BRANSAWDER has just recieved from Nurimbnrg?
PUT UPON.—No, your Brother BOBBY is quite wrong. His
long torn gun may be the most purfect moddle—but it is out
of a place in a dolls droin-room, and I should tell Nurse.
JOSEFINE.—Yes, I should certainly have a mirror over the
mantlepeice. I wonder if yon have seen the old Vinetian ones
Mr. BRANSAWDER sells at 4s. Cd.? Or he has a convecks one
with a dear little gilt egle on top that would go nicely with
your Umpire fcrnicher.
SELF HELP.—No trouble at all, dear. I like all the sampils
you send me. Perhaps the brokade with the teeny rosebuds
that you took out of your Mama's Court trane is the prettiest
and would make charming curtins for the bedroom. But the
pale grene silk from the inside of the worktable is alliuost as
good, and as you took out the whole of the lining you conic
have your chares, etc., recuvered to match. Mr. BRANSAWDER
(for adress see ansers to other corispondence) would do this
for you at a merely nominle charge. 1 hope you got your dear
Mama's leve before taking the stuff. Mamas are so funny alx>ui
things sometimes.
CONNIE CULCHERD.—No, Mr. BRANSAWDER has some exquiset
nik-naks, but they are all_ moddern. If you have realy se'
your heart on having anteeks, couldn't you find some in your
Mama's droin-room? I got two luvly little old Dressden
immiges out of a cabbinet for my doll's droin-room mantlepiecc
and a carved ivory chestman which looks most handsome on a
sidetable. Perhaps your dear Papa colects Japinese nitchkies
or tiny brons stattuets like mine does. If you borow one o
two of these and paint them with gold or silver paint they lool
quite magniflsent. But ask first—unless you 're quite sure thej
wouldn't mind.
A VICTIM.—(1) When I discribed how I papered my doll's
house I told you how sevearly I was made to sufer for it, and i
serves you right for doing the same. Perhaps your deer Mauu
is a little narow-minded, but as you seem to have damiged some
valluble bindings without getting any papers that looket
sattisfactry when up, I 'm afrade I must agree with her that i
was wantunly mischevious. Anyhow, you can't put the blame
on me. (2) Yes. 999 Oxford Street. Ql'EENJB.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ACTOR-MANAGER DISCOURSES.
[The follomng homily is addressed to an author of established
reputation who has applied his gifts to the production of an
original literary drama not unworthy of SHAKESPEARE, but
betraying ignorance of the modern requirements of the British
stage.]
WE have perused your meritorious play
With that impartial condescension which
Our sense of justice leads us to bestow
On budding talent: but it will not do.
Yet if your ignorance be well advised
To draw instruction out of present failure
Our words will not be wasted on the wind.
And, first, to rectify a false conceit
Frequent enough in literary men
Who look on drama as a branch of letters,
Whereas, in point of fact, their lower art
Is but the menial handmaid of the stage—
Were SHAKESPEARE (who is fortunately dead)
Among the living candidates for fame
His plays would not command a button's purchase.
We patronise him with the deference due
To the immortal Dead who take no fees;
While on the credulous audience he lays
The spell of antique unction like a church
Whereof the priestly management supplies
A splendid ritual, careless of the cost.
Hence the success he still achieves despite
His damne'd gift of literary style;
Also despite his pestilential habit
Of holding mirrors up to human life,
A daring enterprise, as you have proved
Whose work betrays this woful want of tact.
For, please to mark the plays whose facile run
Is as the going of a god on wheels.
Do their inventors draw from actual life?
Sir, they are men of business; they adopt
The safe conventions of the story-book's,
The only certain.shaft to perforate
A British bosom.
Take our soldier-author,
Our Second in Demand, if we allow
The leading place to SHAKSPEARE—does he let
His military knowledge mar his play,
And give us soldiers such as they are found
Extant in visible barracks? No, not he;
He knows his theatre too well for that.
He has his finger on the pulsing heart
Of myriad clients clamorous for the type
Long-hallowed by the shilling novelette,
Crystallized in the monthly magazines
By woman's fancy soaring past the facts!
If we detect in your submitted work
A fault more obviously patent than
Your fatal gift of reproducing Nature,
'Tis the incorrigible craving for
Originality. Let us inform you
That there are movements in the tastes of men
Which, caught upon the hop, conduct to fortune.
Only an innate sense of unseen things
May suifl the presage of them on the breeze,
Tracing a tendency toward Musketeers,
A hankering for good old Drury Nells,
An urgent boom in left-off mistresses
Rudely resurgent on the wedding-eve.
These things are in the universal air
Subtle as patchouli, appealing to
A lot of sentient playwrights all at once.
So, too, the law that regulates the plot,
Confining it to well-established themes,
Applies with equal force to dialogue;
The public likes to recognise a friend,
Not to be made to think. That was the rock
On which the argosy of BERNARD SHAW,
Packed with unminted specie, went and split.
Once more, beware of letting poetry,
Especially the blanker sort of verse,'
Disturb the claims of those interpreters
On whom your hopes depend. Their primal task
Is to arrest attention on themselves,
And not divert it to the author's work.
Though exquisitely conscious how a line
Should be enounced, a noble jealousy
Might paralyse them with the fear that you,
Rather than they, should earn the pit's applnuse.
We here allude, of course, to poetry
Designed to penetrate the average brain,
Not to the loftier kind which tends to leave
The public nervous, like a little child
Vaguely aware of tricks imposed upon it.
Further—a common error with the scribe—
Your play reveals a crude intelligence
Stultified by a total disregard
Of the peculiar faculties of those
On whom the duty of " creation" falls.
Thus, we have failed to find a leading part
Composed to illustrate o«r special gifts.
Your only character that strikes the eye
Is, we observe, a withered patriarch!
Must we assume this dotard's senile years,
And waste our youth beneath a hoary beard,
And have no scope for that high power of passion
By which it is our undisputed pride
To hold the women's throbbing hearts in thrall?
To merit our regard a man must write
A drama round ourself, as Greekish art
Upreared a suitably receptive shrine
About the sacred Image dropped from heaven.
In fine, you lean too much to Nature's ways,
Who lets no mortal dominate her stage
But loves to deal her entrances and exits,
And much between, without respect of persons.
Art, on the contrary, discriminates,
Lifting the Actor-Manager aloof
From those inferior persons in his pay
Who have no just occasion to exist
Save as the negligeable satellites
On whom his scintillating talents play
(Since even genius demands a foil);
Who herald his approach, and in his presence
Veil their identities, and stand aside
For culminating curtains all his own.
Thus are the facts of life improved upon,
Art's noblest function being to correct
An oversight of Nature. Try again. O. S.
SUGGESTION FOR AN ARTIST (in plenty of time for next year's
Academy).—We 've had several varieties on the subject of
Finding the body of Harold, and not a few on Tlie Finding of the
Infant Moses in the Bulrushes. Henceforward let these subjects
be tabooed, and let another be started which offers fine scope
for imaginative composition, grand colour, and strong dramatic
effect. It is—The Finding of The Jury in a Cause Celebre.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
BETA FRANCIs and Eliza KEARY have between them spoiled
what might have been an attractive work. Had they com-
pressed The Francis Letters (HUTCHINSON) into a single volume,
it would have been well. They have filled two, and the result
is deplorable. There is no excuse for the fatuity. The
character of the mass of the materials at their disposal is
described with charming frankness and perfect accuracy by
BETA FRANCIs, great granddaughter of Sir PHILIP, who began
making the collection. “It is impossible,” she writes, “to
imagine why some of these letters were kept. Many of them
are very dull and bald. Some contain nothing but minute
accounts of illness, with distressing particulars of the rough
medical treatment of a century ago. Scarcely any would have
been worth preserving.” Miss FRANCIS nevertheless preserved
them, and, the task ending fatally, Miss KEARY has dumped
them down on a long-suffering public. My Baronite, a con-
scientious reviewer, nearly shared the fate of Miss FRANCIS
before he reached the end of the first volume. But it's a poor
heart that never rejoices. Stubbornly plodding on into the
second volume he came, near the end withal, upon a batch of
eight letters written by ELIZA JoHNSON, who later became Sir
PHILIP's daughter-in-law. These are simply delightful, giving
sprightly accounts of life in an English country house at the
beginning of the century. Inspired by this touch of native
genius, the letters of Sir PHILIP FRANCIS, hitherto dull like the
rest, begin to sparkle. Up to this period they have supplied
the weightiest evidence yet put in the scales against his being
the writer of the Junius Letters. About this time, notably in
his correspondence with Lady THANET, there flash occasional
sparkles of the pointed pen of the famous Letter-Writer. The
Diary of Sir PHILIP's spendthrift–daughter MARY, with its
prophetic touches of Mr. Micawber, and the story of little
EM'LY, sister to MARY JOHNSON, told by that incomparable
writer herself, are full reward for wicked waste of time on the
first volume. But these gems of purest ray serene lie hidden
fathoms deep in pointless verbiage.
The English Turf (METHUEN) is a record of horses and courses,
made by Mr. CHARLEs RICHARDsoN and edited by Mr. E. T.
SACHS. My Baronite is not an authority on racing, except, to
some extent, in the matter of the Parliamentary Stakes. It
seems to him, however, that in this handsome volume, with
its plans and illustrations of all the great racecourses snapped
at the right moment, the last word is said in respect of English
racing. After a preliminary chapter on the position of the
Turf, others are devoted to Newmarket, Ascot and Goodwood,
Epsom, and the Yorkshire Meetings. Breeding, Lines of Blood,
| Trainers and Jockeys are each carefully dealt with. Mr.
Richardson traces ToD SLOAN's startling seat on the horse to
study of the Indian on horseback. Its practical advantage is
found in the fact that by lying along the neck of the horse with
his hands close to the animal's ears, the jockey lightens the
horse's burden by 5 lbs., a serious consideration. This calcula-
tion is based on the supposition that the horse is travelling at
thirty-five miles an hour, a pace which fixes atmospheric
resistance at the rate of 5 lbs. per square foot.
The Baron recommends GEORGE PASTON's Little Memoirs of
the Eighteenth Century (GRANT RICHARDs). One “little
memoir" can be taken at intervals by way of refreshment
during any reading of quite another sort, and the dose will
have a refreshing effect. Let the Baron warn his followers
against the deception of so sensational a title to one of the
memoirs as The Romance of John Tweddell, which looks attrac-
tive, but the “memoir” is not by any means up to its title.
The story of Lady CRAVEN, fascinating and flighty, shows her to
have been, in her superior line of life, a specimen of the genus
whereof Becky Sharpe was so memorable a type. The “little
memoir” of GEORGE CUMBERLAND, playwright and dramatist,
novelist, poet, essayist, editor, civil servant, amateur diploma-
tist, and controversial theologian is an entertaining study.
Pitifully jealous was CUMBERLAND of SHERIDAN who satirised
him in the character of Sir Fretful Plagiary. By the way, Mr.
PASTON misquotes the well-known line in the picture-dealing
scene in the Schºol for Scandal, and speaks of Uncle Oliver's
portrait as a “villainous disinheriting countenance.” How
weak is this instead of the “damned disinheriting ”with which
we are all familiar. How came Mr. PASTON to “bowdlerise"
this line 2 However, for the sake of the merits of his book, for
this mis-quotation shall Mr. PASTON be pardoned by the
generous, forgiving BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

total lack of training and mili- |

amusements. "All this may, as
I say, continue to be written
until the crack of doom, but,
if appearances may be taken
as a guide, our officers seem
likely to continuefield-sporting
in spite of everything and
everybody. It is not my part
here to say whether they are
right or wrong, but I may be
permitted to point out that the
officers themselves are but little
to blame. Tradition is the
wrong-doer, tradition (other-
wise known as the tone, or
esprit de corps) which lays it
down that the man who doesn't
ride to hounds when he can,
play polo or cricket, or help in
the regimental race, meeting,
is a muff. Soldiers are cer-
tainly not the men who are
likely to set themselves against
tradition, and behold, there-
fore, every soldier who can
buy, or hire, or borrow a hunter
patronises all the meets of
hounds that he can con-
veniently attend. Very wel-
come they are, too, as a rule.
Not every soldier, to be sure,
is a good rider. Indeed, you
may see some quaint sights on
horseback issuing from the constructED.
precincts of garrison towns, ' -
and may learn on inquiry that, they bear military titles. But
whether they ride well or ill (and most of them ride well),
they all ride with immense dash and pluck.
“Hold hard there, Sir, hold hard,” you may hear the Master
saying well above his breath; “give the hounds a chance,”
and you will observe Captain THRUSTER, of the 90th Lancers
(Queen, ADELAIDE's Own), obviously endeavouring to pick out
the line for himself and acting the part of the leading hound, the
pride of the pack. Then, if you know the gallant Captain—and
who doesn't know that light-hearted, terse and healthy soldier?
—you can make an opportunity of riding up alongside of him
and saying to him in your most conciliatory style, “They're
going pretty slow to-day,” to which he will reply, “Slow 2 I
should think they were slow. I’d back myself to kick my hat
faster than these hounds can go. And, by Jove, even if they
do want to go these fellows never give 'em a chance; they’re
always taking 'em off the line and casting back, and trying
to show how doosid clever they are. 'Pon my word, if this kind
of thing goes on I shall take to drag-hunting and chuck the
fox-hounds.”

THE HANDY MAN.
WHAT HE will HAVE To BECOME, IF RECRUITING For THE NAVY
CONTINUES TO FALL OFF, AND MANY MORE NEW BATTLESHIPS ARE
... So the Captain, justly offended
in his tenderest feelings, will
fulminate. But the next mo-
ment there's a scattering of
horses and a “Yoick 1 '' from
the huntsman and a “Gone
away !” from someone else,
and off sets the Captain, ventre
& terre, as straight as a line,
over a stiff country. “By the
Lord Harry,” he says at the
end of the run, when the hounds
have killed their fox, “that
was a pretty hot thing, and no
mistake. There isn't another
lot of hounds could show you
sport as good. Anyhow, I don't
want better,” and he'll offer
you a pull from his flask and a
sandwich from his case, and at
the end of the day he'll jog
his fifteen miles home happy in
the knowledge that he jumped
the most amazing fences in the
worst places, pounded half the
field, left the Master, the hunts-
man and the whips far behind,
took the hounds along for the
last three miles by himself, and
altogether enjoyed himself as
only a hard-riding soldier, un-
troubled by heavy intellectual
cares or thoughts of the why
and wherefore in human affairs,
can enjoy himself. And at the
next meet he'll be there again,
and, if he is checked by the
Master, as he is sure to be, he
will again fulminate, and in the
end he will enjoy himself again.
For, after all, you may say
what you will about an officer's
military capacity, but you

an A1 sportsman, wherever you meet him.

DEAR MR. PUNCH, — You may have
noticed that recently a number of papers
have been publishing what may be called
"pictorial statistics." For example, one
of your contemporaries showed the com-
parative size of the police force in the
various countries of Europe. England's
constable was larger than France's guar-
dian of the peace, and so on.
The popularity of the series to which
I have referred encourages me to send
you a few sketches, but without the
pictures.
Who would believe that it would take
twenty - seven million billion postage
stamps to extend from the centre ol
Piccadilly to the frontiers of the moon?
Who would fancy for a moment that a
ray of light travels through space at
twenty-four million times the velocity ol
a nine-inch shell?
Is it not wonderful to consider that i
every boy, girl, man and woman joinec
hands they wouldmake a circle wide enough
to include Saturn, taking the Earth as a
centre.
And here I pause for a moment, thai
those of your readers who have followec
me so far may work the problem out for
themselves.

Father Thames speaks :—
TIME was when my silvery waters
Were gay with the barges 1 bore,
And the laughter of London's fair daughters
Was heard on my echoing shore;
And gallant young -watermen courted
Sweet maids at that magical hour
When Love in his cockle-shell sported
From Westminster Bridge to the Tower.
Queen BESS loved the plash of my billows
That lapped on the bow of her bark,
As, sunk in the down of her pillows,
She glided to fair Greenwich Park;
The merry young monarch found leisure
On my glittering waves to disport,
And fair were the daughters of pleasure
I wafted to sweet Hampton Court.
Mr. PEPYS, in sartorial glory
The envy and wonder of all,
Delighted to crack a good story
As he blithely took ship to Whitehall.
Gay ladies and courtiers tender
On my bosom delighted to row,
And all was life, beauty and splendour
On my sunshiny waves long ago.
But now scarce a lingering wherry
Is seen on my desolate shore,
And the laughter that once rang so merry
O'er my -waters is heard there no more.
Of all the gay craft that were dotting
My roystering tide, -what are here
But the crazy old hulks that lie rotting,
Neglected, off Battersea Pier?
The Seine has her nimble flotillas
Whereon her tired toilers may fly
At eve to their rose-covered villas
And gardens. Then why have not I?
Why are my pale citizens driven
To the bowels of earth, and denied
The air and the freshness of heaven
That ripple my fast-flowing tide?

[MB. PIXEEO recently confessed that he could not write n play about the
middle-classes. In his search for dramatic complications suitable for repre-
sentation on the stage he found himself compelled to place his uhunictcrs
higher in the social scale.]
I AM » hard-worked city clerk, my salary is small,
My social status hardly worth considering at all. [bleed
I've a wife and several children and the hardest heart miglit
If it saw my weekly income and the mouths it has to feed.
For years I 've borne my poverty in uncomplaining fashion
Feeling confident uiy woes excited general compassion.
I knew my life was bitter, 1 imagined it was tragic,
And the thought sufficed to lighten grief and charmed my cares
like magic!
i
When calamity oppressed me I endured it like a stoic,
And took comfort in the thought that my behaviour was heroic;
But now I find that dramatists won't have mo for a hero
And the dismal news has come from Mr. ARTHUR WING PINERO.
It seems he cannot weave a plot round men in humble stations,
He looks in vain among them for dramatic complications,
He can people comedies with dukes and other titled asses
But he cannot write a play about the lower middle classes.
I own I 'in disappointed, for I always hoped one day
I should see myself presented as the hero of a play;
I pictured crowded audiences echoing my groans
Through several moving scenes by Mr. HENRY ARTHUR JONES.
In vain! My hopes of figuring in drama were a dream,
No Keif-respecting dramatist will take me as his theme,
He cannot write a play about a pauper in an attic
For though it's sad that people starve it's very undramatic!
His subjects are the common ones, of love and death and
marriage,
But his heroine's mamma will keep two footmen and a car-
riage,
For, if a playwright knows his work, he's very well aware
That heroines of.comedies must live in Grosvenor Square.
He stimulates your sympathies for this attractive girl
By making her the daughter of a very wealthy carl,
While her lover's an attache, winning diplomatic laurels,
A youth of most exalted birth but rather dubious morals.
Both pit and stalls are tortured by the fear he '11 be rejected,
For though he is a shocking scamp he 's very well connected,
So no one 's really happy till these doubts are set at rest
And the too forgiving heroine has clasped him to her breast!
My readers will have gathered from this harrowing recital
That you cannot figure in a play unless you have a title,
There 's therefore very little chance, as far as I can see,
That anyone will ever write a drama about ME.

THE NEW RENAISSANCE.
BY AHTIHT. CONDER.
I.
THE whole concern sprang from MOBERLEY'S fit of the blues.
Wo were sitting in the smoking-room—MOBERLEY, myself, and
some half-dozen other members of the Disappointed Authors'
Club—a silent and very gloomy company. Now and then a
gleam of light came into some eye. as its owner culled an
inspiration from the newspaper, or the ceiling, or the bowl
of his pipe; but it flickered out again quickly enough as he
remembered the permanent and unalterable regret of all editors
that they were unable, etc. We were, every man of us,
sufferers from cacoPthes scribendi, engendered, no doubt, by
the deadly bite of what SMALLEY used to call the "/aw; de
sikcle." MOBERLKY was, perhaps, the greatest sufferer of us
all. Dear, painstaking fellow! How regularly every day he
used to send forth at least one MS., like the dove from the
Ark, to see whether the waters had abated! And how un-
failingly the dove used to return, having found no rest for the
sole of her foot; bearing, none the less, in her beak that polite
little olive-branch from the regretful editor! Younger than
the rest of us was MOBERLEY, and had not yet reached the
silent stage of despair. He burst out now, with, ''I'm sick
of it!"
"Of what in particular?" asked MEDLICOTT wearily.
"Of this senile, doddering, semi-defunct old century; so
semi-defunct that no one seems quite to know whether it's
actually dead or not."
"Stop! stop!" cried BRODIE encouragingly. "Material for
a set of light verses there."
"Do you think I don't know that?" said MOBERLEY with a
savage laugh. "I've made light verses on it—seven light
verses—and they 've been rejected fourteen times. Don't talk
to me about light verses. Why the deuce can't the century
die, and have done with it?"
"Certainly," said SMALLEY, in his piping voice; " it will be
delightful to kneel by its grave with the cool, morning breezes
of a new-age fanning one's fevered brow."
"And to feel the full, fresh life of a young and unsophis-
ticated century throbbing around one," said MORIARTY, who
had just entered with McCASKlLL. "Yes, it will be very
refreshing. There will be new ideas, new sensations, the first
nascent tremblings of great new movements. I myself shall
buy a new fountain pen."
"Psh! Absurd! Ridiculous nonsense!" growled STARK,
from his armchair. "There won't be any change at all—at
least, not in us. Decadents we are, and decadents we shall
remain."
"But, my dear fellow," said MORIARTY, "you can't be
decadent at the beginning of a century. Just you try."
Then spoke that great man, McCASKlLL. "MORIARTY is
perfectly right. The decadence cannot continue. What then?
Don't you see the alternative? There must be a Great Twen-
tieth Century Renaissance! And we must conduct it!"
We hailed McCASKILL's stupendous idea with enthusiasm,
and it was decided to call a meeting of the Club at once.
MOBERLEY alone looked doubtful. "What," he said, "if the
world refuses to take any notice of us?"
"My good boy," said MORIARTY, "they're bound to take
notice of you if you 're a renaissance. Sooner or later, I mean.
At first we may be scoffed at, even ignored. But we shall be
a quiet, working force, gradually permeating the whole of
society. Do you see ?''
"Thank you, yes ; it's beautiful!" said MOBEHLEY.
So a meeting was called, a Committee chosen, and McCASKlLL
appointed Chairman. We were considering the further ap-
pointment of sub-Committees for the special management of
the various branches of our work—the literary branch, the
musical branch, the sculpture and painting branch, the dining
branch, &c., when BRODIE interrupted the proceedings to say
that it was impossible to go on without considering the
question of funds. Wo all had a great respect for BRODIE;
he was that wonderful thing known as "a good man of
business," the only one in the Club. Ho hailed from Glasgow.
So we listened attentively to his suggestions. Ho pointed out
that the great work on which we were embarking must neces-
sarily involve large expenditure (particularly in the dining
branch); and he ventured to recommend a subscription of £30
per annum, payable in advance to an Honorary Secretary and
Treasurer.
We all approved the sound sense of this ; but could not help
laughing a little at BRODIE for having run his head into a noose.
Of course, he was the only possible man for Treasurer. HRODIE
joined in the laugh, and accepted the post with great good
humour. We had always known BRODIE as a nice, unselfish
fellow.
II.
SMALLEY was for putting off the renaissance till 1901, but, aa
the Chairman ably pointed out, in an age when Christmas
numbers appeared in October, and besieged towns were relieved
in anticipation by the telegraph, it was only fitting that the
Great Renaissance of the Twentieth Century should have its
beginning in the last year of the Nineteenth. The observation was
greeted with applause, and we were about to set to work in
good earnest when STARK, who really ought never to have got
on the Committee at all, blurted out that we knew perfectly
well we were a pack of blooming decadents, and, as such, quite
incapable of starting a decently-conducted renaissance. This
vulgar and wholly unexpected outburst created a considerable
sensation, and some unpleasantness might have ensued had not
our Chairman called the house to order, and then with his
unerring tact demonstrated the Tightness and pregnancy of the
phrase " blooming decadents." It was out of decay alone, he
said, that new life could be expected to spring: and if only we
were sufficiently far advanced in our decay we might hope,
indeed, to bloom. Very happy, this, and quite silenced the
opposition. BRODIE, the Secretary, and our boldest spirit, then
rose to make a few introductory remarks. Ever since the Dis-
appointed Authors had been turned into the New Renaissance
Club, he said, it had been felt that the most pressing question
for consideration was: How shall we regulate and improve the
output of fiction? At present the public was inundated by a
sea of literature in which the few, the very few, works of real
merit were hopelessly swamped. Our first care, therefore,
should be to formulate some restrictive measure which should
give a fair chance to quality by reducing quantity. Much more
from BRODIE to the same effect; all very excellent. Then
occurred the really painful scene of the evening. It was pretty
clear from the first that STARK had no real sympathy with the
movement, still, we none of us expected him to break out as he
did. Perhaps it was the persistent rejection of " Seared Souls"
by the publishers which had embittered him. He said that if the
new renaissance was to be any good at all it must abolish fiction
altogether; fiction was unnecessary, demoralising. The reading
world, and, still more, the writing world, would be far happier
without it. It was responsible for all the evils of the time—
pauperism, for example. The amount of pauperism in a country
was in direct proportion to the amount of rags; the supply of
rags was regulated by the demands of the paper-mills; and the
paper-mills owed half their work to the publishers of fiction;
hence, no novels, fewer paper-mills; fewer paper-mills, fewer
rags; fewer rags, less pauperism. And as for the leisured
classes, we knew how fiction demoralised them; how they
worked off all their human feelings of sympathy, love and pity
upon imaginary characters, until they had none left for the
living world around them. It was in a terrible silence that
STARK sat down. There was a short, tense pause before the
Chairman rose and intimated that if those were really the

honourable member's sentiments, he had
better go and have a little renaissance by
himself outside. STARK refusing to take
the hint, MORIARTY, the strong man of the
Club, was appointed official chucker-out,
and forcibly removed him. Very painful
indeed. But necessary. The meeting
was adjourned till that day week.
III.
PUNCTUALLY at nine o'clock the Chairman
rose to his feet. He said that we had
before us a most interesting problem.
Though we might not, and did not, agree
with a late member of the Club in con-
sidering that total abstinence from fiction
was necessary or desirable, yet we might
(and did) hold that some regulative mea-
sure was advisable alike for the sake of
public and of authors. He invited sugges-
tions. SMALLEY, rising, said that, of
course, State intervention would be neces-
sary. (Cries of "No, no!") Yes, yes.
We must use the best means that come to
our hand, and the invocation of State
authority need not hinder the true inward-
ness of the movement. He was for begin-
ning with the brewers—he meant the
authors. (A little coarse of SMALLEY, this.)
He would have a thorough system of Gov-
ernment inspection to prevent the issue of
harmful or adulterated stuff. (Cries of
"Who's to be the inspector?") Why,
who but one of the promoters of the
renaissance? (General grunt of satis-
faction.) This alone would reduce the
fictional output, he calculated, by at least
seven-eighths. Thus SMALLEY. WIMPLETT
followed with a suggestion that the female
sex should be placed under a legal dis-
ability. This, he said, would reduce the
remaining eighth by one-half. MOBERLEY
objected to the clause as unnecessary,
since this class of authors was already
provided for by SMALLEY's system of
Government inspection. CRIPPS, ever full
of statistics, at this point jumped up with
the amazing statement that the annual
output of works of fiction would still
amount to seven thousand five hundred
and sixty-three, or, including the bound
volumes of the daily papers, to seven
thousand five hundred and seventy-two.
Hence, he thought, it would be necessary
to supplement the measure for Government
inspection by a system of local option.
He himself had come across the case of a
provincial town in which there were as
many as sis booksellers' shops in one
street. Was not this state of things
scandalous? (Cries of "How long was
the street? ") He preferred not to answer
frivolous questions. It was obvious that
six bookshops was an inordinate allowance
for any street whatsoever. Why, a con-
firmed reader of bad fiction might succeed
with heroic fortitude in passing five of
those temptations and yet succumb to the
sixth. (A young member: "On the other
hand, he might succumb to the first, and

TOO MUCH FOR .ME, I SHALL TRY THE TRIANGLE I"
then where are you?") Really, ho was
not accustomed to having his ideas treated
in thM flippant way. If anyone had a
better proposal to make he should like to
hear it. CRIPPS sat down in a huff. There
was really no need to take much notice
of CRIPPS. It was at this point that I
made my own modest contribution to the
discussion. I remarked that there was
another scheme which had met with con-
siderable favour in a different field. To
state it baldly, it came to this; that no
bookseller should bo allowed to serve a
customer with fiction without at the same
time selling him some solid food, in the
shape, for example, of a history book or a
science primer. The idea caught on at
once, and the formulation of a measure to
this effect was set down as one of the
propaganda of the Club.
"My dear fellow," said BRODIE to me
in an undertone, "it is magnificent! It
shall bo done, by Jove, it shall! And
you and I will write history books—and
science primers 1 Lots and lots and lots
of science primers!"
The meeting came to a close at 12.30a.m.,
after a sub-committee had been appointed
to consider the kindred questions of
circulating libraries and revolving book-
cases.
I must mention, however, a little
difference which arose after the meeting
between BRODIE, our Treasurer, and
McCASKlLL. McCASKlLL (who is a splendid
fellow, but no man of business) thought

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
that BROIUE ought to submit the accounts
quarterly to the Club. Of course, this
was a terrible insult, and I could see that
BRODIE felt it keenly, though quite aware
that it resulted from sheer ignorance of
business principles. He behaved admi-
rably, not losing his temper in the
slightest, but quietly pointing out that a
Treasurer's business was to 'keep the
accounts; and that if he let them go out
of his keeping, he would be false to his
trust. Of course, when he put the matter
in that light, McCASKILL saw it at once
and apologised handsomely.
(To be continued.)

I DO not know a sadder case
(It is a theme I can't be mute on !)
Of hoodwinking the human race
Than by the late Sir ISAAC NEWTON.
Alas ! he spent a long career
In teaching errors astronomic,
For instance, that the Earth's a sphere—
A blunder that is really comic!
He tried, of course, to nullify
The truth that has been known for ages,
The science plain to half an eye
In HOMKK and the Hebrew sages.
There we are told the Earth is flat,
And has Jerusalem for centre,
Or Delphi—into more than that,
'Twere almost blasphemous to enter!
I personally give my vote
For THALES' simple ipse dixit,
Who makes the world on water float.
As terra flrtua thus I fix it.
In this the Hindoos and Chinese
And other learned folk support us,
In resting this abyss of seas
Eventually upon a tortoise.
Still, moderns want some kind of proof—
1 '11 therefore give them one that new is;
To shew the earth's no domo-like roof,
I bid them take a trip to Suez.
Were the world-surface spherical,
I 'd like to hear them splve this riddle—
Why through each end of that canal
No water runs down from its middle?
No answer comes! and so we know
The antipodes have no existence,
And round the world COOK couldn't go—
The Ophir's wasting its persistence!
The moon is made of cheese that's green,
The sun's n disc, its brother planet;
No blatant contradictor's been
Nearer than I, I 'in sure, to scan it!
I grieve for CHRISTIK, LOCKYER, BALL,
And so I '11 end, as I began, well;
Vainly and flat on deaf ears fall
These counterblasts I send from Han-

THE RUIN OF A CRICKET INVEN-
TION (1904).
(From a contemporary journal.)
IT was the evening of the eighth day
of the Great Cricket Match, "All Eng-
land v. the Boers," when a man of sinister
aspect might have been seen examining
one of the new Patent Machine Bowlers,
authorised by the Committee of the Make-
all-you-can Cricket Club. The man, in
the most noiseless fashion possible, in-
serted a key into the forearm of the
Mechanical Bowler. It was well-known
to the public under the name of "TRUN-
DLBR." The match recommenced on the
next day, and the Boers having 14000.5
runs to win (by the Decimal Fraction
Teleboard), TRUNDLER was put on to
bowl. Directly the figure commenced
operations a yell of horror—for British
subjects are always fair-minded if foul-
mouthed come from the spectators. In a
word, "TRUNDLER " was throwing!!!
The officers of the M.C.C. met together
and pronounced against the peccant figure.
The Boers were, by common consent and
the engrossed authority of the M. C. C. on
vellum, awarded the contest amid the
illuminations of the Zoological Gardens
and St. John's Wood, and the regatta on
the Regent's Park Canal was merely a
fitting sequel to the great event.
Subsequently the Patent American
Jockey, manufactured entirely in British
steel, was severely censured by the
Stewards of Sandown Park, but as he
was not provided with the Triplex
Electric Speaking Apparatus, he was un-
able to pronounce the baptismal name of
Mr. HWFA WILLIAMS, and was warned off
the course.
But the Patent Bowler died and was
replaced by a Registered Underhand
Universal Lob-chucker, of British Manu-
facture which was guaranteed never to
"shy."
SMALL BY DEGREES AND BEAUTI-
FULLY LESS.
(Study of an article interrupted by the
veering round of public opinion.)
NOTHING could be better than the scheme
that was presented to a deeply interested
House last night. It was listened to with
wrapt attention, and the impression of
any reasonable person who heard the
statement was of unmixed satisfaction.
(Pause of forty-eight hours.)
The scheme that was unfolded to a full
House a day or so ago scarcely bears
successfully the test of maturer considera-
tion. There are, no doubt, flaws that may
be found possible of removal, but at the
first blush they seem almost fatal to what,
after all, can only be considered in the
light of an experiment.
(Pause for another couple of days.)
It will cause no astonishment that the
scheme, ushered in with so brave a flourish
of trumpets, when examined by experts
is found to be wanting in all that at first
seemed to recommend it to general
appreciation. In this age of keen criticism
nothing escapes review, and if ever there
was need for deliberation, this so-called
plan is one emphasising that requirement.
It is a matter of conjecture whether the
proposals, that seemed at first so plausible,
can be accepted with the necessary safe-
guards protecting the interests of a mighty
empire.
(At the end of the week.)
Ncthing could be worse than the scheme
that was presented to a deeply interested
House seven days ago. After careful
deliberation, the impression that must be
left on the mind of any reasonable person
who has given it anxious consideration is
one of unmixed dissatisfaction.

Beats on the burnt-up town,
When Mayfair packs her trunks and flies
To moor and breezy down;
When, dense as cattle in a pen,
My children in their slums
Lie sick and panting—then, ah ! then

That in my alleys seethe,
And poisonous the evil air
My hapless children breathe;
While down the kennel, through the reek
Of rotting refuse, lo!
Disease, his easy prey to seek,
Stalks grimly to and fro.
Water! they cry ; the stifling air
For water, water sighs;
The faintiug earth in her despair
For water, water cries;
All nature, sick wellnigh to death
Beneath the savage sun,
For water calls with her last breath—
But water there is none.
Thrice blest my sister of the north
For whom Loch Katrine pours
Her cool, life-giving treasures forth
In never-ending stores,

"WHERE is JANE?" asked the father
for the second time. This time his manner
suggested that the east wind had got

The mother saw no help for it; she had
tried to protect her daughter's secret.
"JANB is writing in her room," said
the mother.
The father wheeled round his chair and
looked sternly at his wife.
"Symptoms the same as ALFRED?" ho
queried.

I think it 'a only a mild attack, dear, this

healthy young man. Then he got restless;
pored over penny magazines, furtively
purchased stationery, and finally "—the

asked me if 1 had a rhyming dictionary.

"Only stories !" shrieked the unhappy
father. "Only stories. Wife, do you
know I had a sister once who wrote only
stories? The horror of those days I shall
never forget. Not till the rest of the

complaint abate. JANE must be placed by

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AET IN THE DOLLS' HOUSE.
BY LITTLE QUEENIE.
§ 8.—About Mr. Bransaivder's Kindness.
I HAVE been so overwelmed -with letters of grattitude and
congratnlashuns about this series that it is simpley imposible
to reply to them indyvijuly, so I must thank my beluved readers
here insted and tell them how delited I feel that these artikles
have been such a help to them.
They are a great pleshure to me to do, besides being a sauce
of much profflt too. Mind, dear readers, that when you are
ordering things at Mr. BRANSAWDER'S, 999, Oxford St., with the
spoted Rokinghorse over the shop (and realy and truly it is the
only liiyhclasx toyshop in London) mind you mention my name
because, besides being sure of getting something in ireprochible
taste, you -will have the sattisfaction of knowing that you are
bennyfltting me.
It is like this: Mr. BRANSAWDER is so plesed with these
artikles that he wants to encurage me to persivere with them,
and he is going to send me a spessimen of every novlety he
gets for nottice in these collums—and I am not to dreme of
returning them afterwards!
That is not all; he says that in f utner he is going to alow me
what he calls a " comislmm" on every perchase by a Custimer
who menshuns these artikles.
A comishun is that, if you perchase a shilling thing on my
reccomendashun, I get a halfpenny out of it; if a two shilling,
a penny, and so on—which is why I allways advise my readers
to buy only the venj best.
Then MR. PUNCH pays me for what I write, and alltogether a
child who desires to be independent and earn her own poket-
money without the humilliashun of aplying to her parents every
time she wants some cannot do better than do as I am.
§ 9.—.4. Word of Warning.
Bnt do not iniajine for a moment that 1 am advising any of
my readers to folow my exampil. It is not everybody that
conM—perhaps nobody but me, though it sounds conseted to
say it. Still, it is more dificult than you think. You see, you
have got to be thurally well ejucated and acustomed to writing
and spcling with purfect esc and acurasy. Then you must
posess ecsquisit taste and judgemint and simpathy, and not
mind what trouble you take.
I am afrade, if you tried, you would only meet with dissi-
pointiueut and falure, and on the hole I cannot reccomend any
of you, dear children, to take to Litteratuer as a carere.
* * * - * * *
Alasl my beluved readers, events have once more turned
out in a manner which I little antisipated 1
My dear Papa is one of those superior pursons that doesn't
read "Punch" but only glanses at the pictuera and says
there is nothing in it this week.
However, the fame of his little Queenie's artikles penny-
trated his ears at last, and sending for the back numbers, he
egerly perused the efusions of his beluved daughter.
At first he rawed with disrcspeeful meriment—but bye and
bye he arived at my honorible uienshuiiH of Mr. BRANSAWDER'S
shop and he nitted his browse and his laufter dyed away in ex-
presions which I cannot sulley my pen by repeting.
Then he sturnly declared that no child of his should receve
comishuns from tradesmen, though I pointed out to him that
Mr. BRANSAWDER was not a common shopman, but a purflct
gentleman who hcd gone into bisness.
Poor Papa was uterly unable to see that that made any
difcrence, and it was in vane that I erged that if Mr. BRAN-
SAWDER'S toys were the best (which they truly ore), I was only
doing my readers and myself good by reccomending them.
But Papa remaned as obstinit as any pig and said it was a
roten sistem and the next thing to bribery and he wouldn't
have it, and I wasn't to acept anything out of the shop without
paying cash down for it and he had a good mind to punch poor
Mr. BRANSAWDER'S head for his impidence—and things like
that!
Well, to avoid unplesantness, I was obliged to give way—but
I can't see why I mayn't take any little presents when Mr.
BRANSAWDER so kindly presses them on my acceptence, only it
apears the grownups are not in the babbit of doing so, and I
think it just shows how silly they are!
I sometimes think my poor dear Papa is just a little Erly
Victorian in his way of looking at things, and doesn't reconise
that we have entered the threshole of a New Sentury.
But, for the present, I have no opshun but to obay, and since
I cannot conshientsusly reccomend any goods which do not
come out of Mr. BRANSAWDER'S shop, and I am not to be alowed
to do it my own way, I haven't the heart to coutinnue this
series any longer—except, perhaps, to anser a few cori-
spoudense who may care to adress a line of comfit and
simpathy to
Their well-mening but constently bailed little friend,

POOD FOK INFANTS.
[" At an inquest held at Newington on a baby two months old, it transpired
that the mother had been feeding him on oato .... The coroner remarked
that he had had cases where children had been fed on whelks, fried fish and
pork chops, and had drunk ale and stout."—Daily Chronicle.}
A BABE was born in a Newington slum,
As healthy a babe as may be,
"With a round little head and a round little turn,
And a white little tooth in a red little gum,
And a voice that would seldom or never be dumb—
In short, a model baby.
The child was remarkably sturdy and stout,
And, for all one could tell of it, clever.
Of that there is no manner of doubt—
No probable, possible shadow of doubt—
No possible doubt whatever.
Now, babes I am given to understand,
Should live 011 a simple diet;
But this one was fed on the fat of the land,
Pork chops and pickles and lobster—canned—
With rum, of an inexpensive brand,
And gin to keep it quiet.
Pork chops and whelks, washed down with stout,
Small babies thrive on never.
Of that there is no manner of doubt—
No probable, possible shadow of doubt—
No possible doubt whatever.
Weeks sped, and wan and wasted and worn
Became that infant cherished;
His ounces were fewer than when he was bom,
His little inside with pain was torn,
And when they came to his cot one morn,
They found that he had perished.
A taste for gin, combined with stout,
Had doubled him up forever.
Of that there is no manner of doubt—
No probable, possible shadow of doubt—
No possible doubt whatever.

can obtain. They 've got the money, they've got the correct
taste, they've got the men to drink, and if they haven't the

THE RAIN OP TERROR;
Or, one more Ingredient.
[According to recent reports, rain of n ruby-red
colour has fallen in southern Europe. The reports

UPON my walks I met a man,
A happy man, who laughed with glee,
High, high indeed, his spirits ran;
A thing I rather like to see.
I touched him quietly on the sleeve,
"My dear good friend," I gently said,
"My curiosity relieve,
And tell me who you are." Instead
Of answering my small behest
He looked me curiously o'er.
Then thumped me soundly on the chest—
A kind of greeting I abhor;
And then he bawled into niy ear
(I swear his lungs were made of leather),
"1 am the clerk, the overseer,
Of that most talked of thing — the
weather.
"I send the rain, I sprinkle snow,
I portion out with sparing hand
The azure sky with sunset glow,
And when I "m glum befog the land.
"The raw material of weather
I deal with as it comes to hand.
I do not send it all together,
But vary it, yon understand.
"I give you, say, a pinch of snow,
A touch of fog, a heavy dew,
And over all a gale I blow;
A kind of atmospheric stew.
"I sometimes add a little frost
In penetrating mists dissolved,
Or hail—I never count the cost.
Variety, I am resolved,
"The spice of life is. Now, old boy,
To you I will at once explain
The reason of my boundless joy;

"One more ingredient! Hooray!
I '11 send you April showers of fire.
Throughout the City every day
The streets shall flow with crimson mire.
"A carmine snow-storm, think of that!
A poppy-mist before a blizzard,
And all the ladies crying, 'Drat
That ready-witted weather wizard !'"
He laughed aloud and sped away,
That clerkly demon of the weather.
I stood there to surprise a prey;
You might have felled me with a feather.
A MORBID REFLECTION.

That lulls me to enjoyment, calm and
Come analysts unkind, [sleepy,

Uneasily I smoke,
While sadly (or in joke)
The crop of dismal horrors they 're
describing;
Though at their proofs I winced,
I 'm only half convinced,
As your delicious perfumes I 'm imbibing.
But when your stump goes out,
I overcome my doubt,
And from my troubled fancy I despatch it
With this profound reflection—
That, if it is infection,
I only wish my Cavendish would catch it.

[APRIL 24, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A GREAT THOUGHT FOE EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR.
SECOND SERIES.
IV.—THE "BRIDGE" SECTION.
APRIL IST.—Bridge is a well-known parlour-game, that may be
played after dinner by ladies and gentlemen indifferently (this
is especially true of ladies). It is also played in clubs; thus
distinguishing itself from " Ping-pong."
2ND.—Bridge is understood to have originated in Thibet,
•where it has long been a sacred perquisite of the Grand Slama.
3RD.—The derivation of the word Bridge is explained as
follows:—When the game was introduced into Europe by
Oriental scholars, the Latin equivalent for Grand Slama was
found to be Pontifex Maximns. Now, a pontifex is etymologi-
oally one who performs rites (facio) on a bridge (pona).
Bridge, therefore, may be said to be associated" with the idea
of sacrificial victims, a view which is daily growing in favour
among the less fortunate exponents of the game. It is only
fair, however, to say that another theory, connecting it with
pans asinorum, has received the approval of many experts.
4TH.—The cause of the supplanting of Whist by Bridge is at
least twofold. (1) Under a thin resemblance to a game hallowed
by traditions of sobriety and respectability, it has insidiously
introduced a chartered form of gambling (with its attendant
debauchery) into the most rigid haunts of virtue. (2) Unlike
Whist (an onomatopoeic word implying the necessity for silence;
of. hush!) the game of Bridge encourages polite conversation
among the players, in this way affording a much-needed relief
to the tension of the mind.
5TH.—It might be imagined that the device of a compulsory
dummy would tend to modify the above-mentioned licence; but
experience has proved that the dummy talks as loud as any
active player during the progress of a hand, and very much
louder immediately after.
CTH.—Abuse of the privilege of cursive comment has led in
some clubs to the overt classification of Bridge under the head
of Games of Hazard (such as Euchre, Pharaoh, and Loo)'; in
some to the revival of the duello; in some (but these cases are
as rare as they are deplorable) to the introduction of the
police.
7TH.—During a dispute between your adversaries on the
subject of the preceding (or even the current) hand, circum-
stances and knowledge of character must decide for you
whether you should take sides in the discussion. If language
of actual contumely is hurtling in the air, then it is as well to
let confusion do its dreadful work without interruption.
STH.—If, however, the debate is friendly and on abstract
lines, each of your opponents giving expression, to a modest
belief in the impregnability of his position, then it is a good
rule for you and your partner to throw your united weight on
one or other side; thus establishing diffidence in the one, and
an overweening confidence in the other.
OTH.—It is further an excellent practice to argue stoutly in
support of a gross mistake committed by the weaker of your
adversaries, that so he may be encouraged to repeat it.
10TH.—You should always give a courteous welcome to an
elementary player who proposes to join your table: for it must
never be forgotten that your chances of making something out
of him are precisely as two to one.
HTH.—Dummy is not supposed to call attention to his
partner's revoke (if it escapes remark) till after the cards have
been cut for the ensuing deal. Then ho is free to offer con-
gratulations and suitable pleasantries. But if attention is
called to the revoke at the time by the adversaries, then
dummy is at liberty to say at once whatever occurs to him.
12TH.—Choice of seats (apart from superstition) may be of
more importance than is commonly supposed. The idea of
taking into account the position of mirrors in a room may be
discarded as ungentlemanlike; but the effect of a legitimate
draught on the back of an opponent already afflicted with a
sorry rheum has been worked out by statisticians as equiva-
lent to fourteen points in every third rubber.
> 13TB.—Honours in Bridge, as in Whist, 'have [no connection
with merit; a fact to which we may partially attribute the
celerity with which politicians have familiarised themselves
with this game.
14TH.—The absence of pockets in ladies' evening-gowns is a
fruitful source of Bad Debts.
15TH.—It has been nicely computed that the relative values
of skill in Bridge and in Whist are as fifteen to four. Conse-
quently, a Government official, devoting to Bridge the same
proportion of his limited leisure as he used to devote to Whist,
is now enabled to lose £98 10s. Od. per annum, of his hardly-
earned income, where he was accustomed to lose only
£26 5s. 4d. This will not, however, prevent him from de-
scribing Bridge as a game in which pure chance predominates.
(To be continued.) O. S.
THAT DREADFUL GAME ; OR, THE TORTURE OF TOMKINS.
ABOUT a fortnight ago I went to dine with the ROBINSONS.
It was au excellent dinner, as all their dinners are, and not
too long, which leaves time for music or cards afterwards.
Like many easy-going men who have passed the first bloom
of youth, I find that suits me perfectly. To listen to music
involves no exertion whatever; to play cards one is at all
events seated; even for pool or billiards one has only to stand
and stroll about. Some dreadfully energetic men I know
always say, "What a lazy beggar TOMKINS is!" But I don't
care.
When we had finished dinner at the ROBINSONS' that evening,
the men were invited to go and smoke in another room. I
thought nothing of that. I imagined that the dining-room had
to be cleared, so that early the next morning it might be
painted, or whitewashed, or undergo some such decoration not
unusual in spring. So I smoked peacefully in the other room
with the other fellows, and then we went into the drawing-
room. No sooner had we entered the door than the young
ladies of the family jumped up and cried joyfully, "Ping
Pong!"
"What's that? "said I.
"Not know Ping Pong, Mr.TOMKiNS?" they asked, derisively.
"I 'm not much good at games," I confessed humbly. "Of
course I 've heard it spoken of, but how do you play it?"
"Come and see, "they replied; "it's as easy as possible. You'll
learn directly. It's such a jolly game. We play every evening.''
I abandoned all hope of peaceful music. One of the girls
sings very nicely, and another plays the piano, but, of course,
no girl would do anything so effeminate if there were a
chance of jumping about with a racquet and. a ball. I felt
sure it must be something of the sort, and I was right.
The whole of that deplorable evening was devoted to that
"jolly game." They stood me at one end of the dining-table,
put a battledore, a beastly baby's battledore into my baud,
and made me aim at a beastly little ball that bounded up from
what some writers call "the festive board." At first I couldn't
hit the thing at all. Then I gave it tremendous whacks, and it
flew up to the ceiling, or hit the pictures, or got mixed
up with the electric light. But wherever it went it always
finished on the floor, and I spent half the time crawling under
tho table, or hitting my head against the sideboard, or
grovelling under the chairs, or lifting up the coal scuttle.
However, several times I hit the silly ball in the right
direction, and the girls said I was "getting on splendidly,"
when all I was anxious for was getting off.
At last they let me go, and I sat at the side of the room with
various admirers of the ghastly game, and, like them—though
in my case from politeness rather than interest—followed the

movements of the ball, our heads wag
ging solemnly from side to side exactlj
like tho head of the old gentleman a
Madame TUSSAUD'S. This gave me such
crick in my neck that I was glad, as an
excuse for no longer looking on, to star
fielding for the girls. Even after dinner
it is less uncomfortable to crawl abou
the floor on one's hands and knees than
to "sit a •while," and wag one's head
and roll one's eyes, and twist one'
neck, till they all ache together, listen
ing meanwhile to the horrid, monotonou
thuds on the beastly battledores, a sounc
which the enthusiasts seem positively tc
enjoy.
Then they made me have another turn
with the battledore, and complimentet
me still more on my vast progress. Bu
I bore it meekly, for after that th<
party broke up. I have since under
stood that this was unusual, as manj
intelligent persons go on till breakfas
time.
A few days ago I heard from somi
mutual friends that the ROBINSON girls
had been making fun of me everywhere
and saying, " Why, Mr. TOMKINS couldn'
even hit the ball!" Well, I never wantet
to hit it. But it was a very unkint
criticism, after I had spent a whole evening
crawling among the furniture to please
them.
Jfow I think of patenting a new game to
be called "Progressive Ping Pong.'
Instead of playing in one room only, which
seems feeble, you put a long table ii
every possible part of the house, anc
put all the rest of your furniture ir
the garden, or the kitchen, or pile it up
in the cellars. I may mention, incidentally
that if you live in a flat you can't plaj
my game at all. Besides, if you tried to,
you would be murdered by the other
tenants, and it would serve you jolly well
right. Well, when you 've cleared your
house, people play my game in every
room, and move on, as in Progressive
Whist. Those who have reached the
ground floor begin again in the attics. So
they need never stop. You needn't give
hem any supper; their enthusiasm is too
;reat for such interruptions; a lemon-
squash on the staircase is the most they
could want. Of course, the prize for the
winner would be a gold-mounted battle-
lore with little gold screws, as on a
cettle-druin, to tune the parchment to
ihe exact note of "ping" or "pong"
.vhich he or she might prefer. I
hope the game will not go out of
ashion before I can introduce my im-
irovement.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UNEXPECTED INTERVIEWS.
THE BITER BIT.
GOOD morning, Mr. WHITE. Congratulate you; -wonderful
success—er—your book, of course. Everyone's talking of it.
Mistake? Oh, no: I'm from the Epoch, you know. Anyone
else been? No one from the Argus? Capital! But they're
d slo-w lot. Well, we flatter ourselves—don't do to waste time,
does it? The public likes its news served hot—and strong—
the stronger the better. Stupid ass, the public, but it likes to
know, you know.
Ah, let me see. Your first interview? Better and better.
Not the last though, or I '11—I Ml eat the Argus. But after
your success—pretty clock, that. Any story? No? Oh, don't
apologise—not your fault. Alarum, I see: Orthro-phoito—
pardon the Greek tag—besides, the rest doesn't apply, we'll
hope—but you do rise early, I presume? Kight, seven, six?
That's all right. The earlier the better for the public, as long
as they don't have to do it themselves. Kr—might 1 see your
bedroom? Oh, I see, yes—camp-bedstead. Cold tub, I sup-
pose. Yes, and then—work before breakfast? Oh, no work
before breakfast? That's bad. Ah, BLAKEf.EY's Exerciser, I
see; that's better. May I feel your arm? Use it myself
generally at the beginning of the year. Time for good resolu-
tions, isn't it? Difficult to keep up though. Five days is my
record. We'll call it STRONG'S, if you don't mind; it'll fit
iu better. Something of this sort:—" a biceps which would do
credit to SANDOW himself, whose Exerciser occupies a prominent
position in "—yes, that runs pretty well.
Thanks, no; no time for smoking. Now then, after the
Exerciser,—you don't run round the Park now, for instance?
You see, I want to work the Spartan note for all it's worth.
No? Or break the ice on the Serpentine? Ah, you row on it, do
you? Yes, that's good. Anyone else there at that time of
[lay? / see—wild fowl and peacocks. Yes, I could bring in
the peacocks,—and the hum of distant London, yes, and the
Liver Brigade in the Row byway of contrast, tins ii» tirbe:
that sort of thing: that will be quite effective.
Well, then we come to breakfast. Pity you have it so early,
by-the-way. You see my notion was to catch you at it,—get
the local colour. My dear fellow, I 'in sure you would, if you 'd
known. Obliging isn't the word—yes, it is though, by Jove!
How would this do?—"Nothing could be more obliging than
the courtesy with which Mr. WHITE "—Yes, I like that. Well,
ne must just do the best we can from stock. Let's see—"The
rising Author had just finished breakfast when I arrived at the
anholy hour of 8.10. I had been -warned " (wish I had) " that I
mist be a very early bird to catch this particular"—'m, yes.
rhere, of course, 1 shall bring in the Spartan simplicity,
3ANDOW, Serpentine, and so on—" the secret of your success,"
irou know. Yes, I begin to see my way. "The debris of his
'rugal meal"—you eat porridge? Capital: it ought to be
porridge. Couldn't do without porridge—and perhaps an egg.
ITi's, you might have a couple of eggs, I think—"as he sat there,
A'atching tho blue smoke curl upwards from his briar-pipe"—
res, I see it's a meerschaum,—" from his battered old briar,
ooking every inch an Englishman, broad-shouldered, curly-
uiired, blue-eyed "—Not blue? Ah, that's a pity. Oh, well—
lot at all, my dear fellow; nature's fault, not yours. We must
lo the best we can with grey. Let's see—Oh, yes—" with the
leep grey eyes of the habitual thinker, betraying a steady,
earnest purpose, it was hard to imagine that this was the man
it whose humour the whole world is"—it wouldn't be a bad
;hing, by the way, if you could manage to say something funny
- " one of Mr. WHITE'S happy remarks" you know, " which we
:annot refrain from placing before the readers of the Epoch."
Won't it come? Oh, well, never mind. I '11 see what I can do
when I get home.
Now about your -work. Done anything before? I don't seem
to remember—oh, anonymous. Well, if you '11 take my advice,
you won't do any more unsigned work; it don't pay. Must
have your name on the bookstalls. Still, I can shove in some-
thing about only equalled by your modesty. Yes, that wouldn't
be bad. Got anything else on the stocks? Not yet?—H'm
—" Mr. WHITE doesn't believe in the modern mercenary method
of beginning a new story before the ink "—'m!—" while his last
book is still smoking hot from the press. He considers that
the inevitable result of making haste to get rich is unfinished
and unworthy work." You don't mind my saying that, do you?
It 's true enough, you know. Why, look at—well, look at the
railway bookstalls.
Enough! My dear sir,'we've hardly begun. Father alive?
That's his photograph, 1 suppose. 'M—ah,—" remarkable face,
vividly recalling the rugged features of the Sage of Cheyne
Walk." Then about your mother. Rather not? By all means.
We always respect these little prejudices, though—well, about
yourself, then. No children, I suppose? Or dog—haven't you
a fox-terrier? Pity, that. Both useful properties. Nuisance
in real life, but excellent copy. However—how would this do?
"Mr. White is at present prevented by the incessant nature of
his work from indulging his strong passion for children and
animals. No fairy footsteps on the stairs, no cheerful barking
to enliven his solitary hours. His motto is"—that'll do.
Trifle poetical, perhaps. Still it's—no, it's not bad.
Now then for some youthful reminiscences. Oh, but, my dear
fellow, you must have. Weren't you at school? Well, then—
top of your class? No? Excellent. "Far from being an
infant prodigy, our author was looked upon as an incorrigible
dunce. Nothing but sheer dogged perseverance "—we mustn't
make you too grim, though. Didn't you ever play tricks on the
master? Caricatures, now, or verses? No? Well, let's see,
I 'm not much of a poet, still I think I could—what was his
name? Briggs?—'m !—figs, wigs, pigs. It'll have to be per-
sonal, of course. I have it; capital B. Small man? Ah, can't
be helped. Listen to this: "How doth the little busy B.
delight to"—he smoked, I suppose? "Delight to smoke and
smite! He smites our somethings"—no, can't say that: "He
caneth gaily all the day, and smoketh half the night." That '11
do—see? You wrote 'em, and then—yes, after he 'd—no, before
he licked you, he said, "Mark my words, boys, Tommy"—
your name is Thomas, I think? "Tommy White will be a
famous writer some day. But—" Not at all, make you a
handsome present of it. It'll go down to posterity like the
versatile-young-dog tale about MILLAIS, and all the rest of 'em.
Such is fame—what?
Then we ought to have your views on something. Doesn't
much matter what. Got any to speak of? Women's wrongs,
now, or—No? Well, it is a bit played out. Still we might
suggest—how about this?—" Asked whether he held decided
views on the Woman Question, Mr. WHITE said with a sigh
that he didn't know the answer. Pressed for a more definite
reply, his eyes lit up with a fire which I had not before observed,
and his pipe went out in its—no—his excitement. Tall, strong,
blue—no, grey-eyed, he stood with his back "—and so on. Then
you might say something. "' You remember,' said Mr. WHITE,
'the familiar quotation, "common are to either sex artifex
and opifexf"' 'Yes,' I murmured, 'and likewise "oaro,
carnis is the same."' 'Well,' continued the brilliant young
author"—haven't called you that before, have I?—"brilliant
young author, taking no notice of my irrelevant interruption—
• there you have the Woman Question in a nutshell. The poet,
of course, meant that all the arts and all the professions were
open—must be open—to those of both sexes.' 'Let 'em all
come,' I suggested with a nervous chuckle. 'Let 'em all
come,' he replied, with a humorous twinkle in his eye, as he
relit his trusty pipe." Well, what d' you think of that for an
impromptu? I 'm getting into my stride at last.
Hallo, look at the time. I must be off. Well, many thanks
for the able way in which you 've seconded my poor efforts to

THE NEW ROAD.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—It is very beautiful
to witness the making of a brand-new
road—I mean in the suburbs, where the
red-brick builder is putting up his houses
and tenements. When those concerned
commence operations they chop down all
the old trees, which are older than Mr.
JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN or Mr. JOHN BURNS,
or for that matter Sir WILLIAM THIHELTON-
DYER, Autocrat of Kew Gardens, who is
also a feller of great intent. When the
road-makers have assassinated all the
trees they throw vast quantities of
Aberdeen granite gravel and water over
the thoroughfare, which is, indeed, no
thoroughfare, because it leads into a
combined brickfield and stone-yard. For
many, many days, tho dwellers in the
fresh and watery dwellings crunch their
corns over the rubble and bark their shins
on casual timber. On dark nights there
are no gas-lamps in order, they fall into
moist and perilous cavities arranged on
the sidewalks like the ambuscades of the
Boer generals. What are those cavities?
They are the holes which the excellent
authorities have dug for planting new
trees, having cut down, as before men-
tioned, all the ancient growth. In a
century wo shall have a miniature
boulevard.
The Aberdeen granite, &e., having boon
converted into a state of slush is then
severely sat upon, torn about, and gene-
rally ill-used by an instrument known as

the Steam Roller, bearing, as a rule, the
White Horse of Kent on its portly bosom.
There is no reason to believe but that,
conducted on certain principles, the
Steam Boiler would bo a great advantage
to the civilisation of the metropolis ajid
its immediate surroundings. It might,
for instance, effectually curb the impetus
of the misguided railway vans and carry-
ing trollies, which roam our streets with-
out let or hindrance. It might also wake
up some of our police - constables at
crossings, and clear the way for the
traffic disturbed by telephonic wire
layers, but as the main factor in a new
street it is disappointing and a demoniac
nuisance.
It may be tho fault of the Aberdeen
granite (N.B., Aberdeen granite must
always bo distinguished, like Doncaster
butterscotch, Everton toffee, Bath chaps,
or Stilton cheeses), [or the gravel or the
water, but the cruel sound of this modern
Car of Juggernauth suggests; the anni-
hilation of tho broauway over which it
lumbers from early morning till dewy eve,
like a County Council Elephant of the
Plciocene age. There is only one pleasing
personage connected with this Colossus
of roads, and he is the veteran armed
with a Communist flag of deep red, who
walks a few yards in front of a monster
whose snorting can be heard for miles.
He is such a delightful creature of fiction,
that in this age of realism we look upon
him with joy. Even the horses give their
customary laugh when they see his banner
of freedom to the new road. He is so
simply lovely because he is so perfectly
useless. Yours faithfully,
PHILIDORA PHLATMAN.

I WILL not laud the football or
The gentlemen who kick it;
Nor ask your kind attention for
Some eulogy on cricket.
Though golf and hockey long ago
Created a sensation,
Old England's sons and daughters know
A finer recreation.
It's oh, for the bounding celluloid 1
Oh, for the six-inch net!
No one denies
There is exercise
In a fiercely fought out " set."
Oh, for the rally that's much en joyed,
Oh, for the tuneful song,
When tho racquets sing,
With a pong and a ping,
And a ping, ping, pong!
And who would bike or ride or row,
Since anyone is able
To keep on rushing to and fro
About the dining-table.
The sweat from off your forehead falls
When mighty is the tussle;
And merely picking up the balls
Develops ev'ry muscle.
It's oh, for the serve that's hard and
Oh, for the wily twist! [fast!
Oh, for the scores
From the battledores,
When the strokes are seldom
missed.
Oh, for the balls that crack at last,
Though they are fairly strong;
You '11 send them wide
If you never have tried
To play ping, ping, pong!
For those of us whose blood is blue
The time it quickly passes;
It also gives enjoyment to
The humbler middle classes.
We bolt our meals, it must be feared,
So eager is our longing
To get the table quickly cleared
And start once more " ping-ponging."
It's oh, for the polished table-tops,
Losing their pristine bloom;
Players don't care
For the wear and tear
In the average dining-room.
Oh, for a game that seldom stops,
Probably we, ere long
Shall hie with despatch
To the 'Varsity match
Of this ping, ping, pong! P. G.

shy nervousness at SQUIRE OF M ALWOOD,
silting far down the bench, shoulder to
shoulder with CAWMEJLI. - BANNERMAN,
facing brass-bound box as if he were again
Leader of the Opposition.
How long is it since the SQUIRE
approached J. M., warbling " Come, live
with me and be my love?" Trustful,
thinking no evil, consent was shyly given.
"Tis the old sad story. Soon the lusty
SQUIRE found retirement palling upon him;

out all night; now has openly abandoned

making debut at Savoy. Behold him to-
night a plump comedian, full of rollicking
humour, singing charmingly withal.
Quite at home with Antonio. Know
him well at our own little theatre by
Westminster Bridge. He 's JOHN BURNS
to a B(attersea). True, never saw JOHN
wearing earrings; but, then, I never met
him on a Sunday. Otherwise, the very
man in height, build, face, gestures, voice
and intonation. In Scene III., Act 4,
the police are called in to remove Antonio
for earlier offence of obstruction (just
like our House, you see). When he
squared his shoulders and roared "Let
me speak a little," I quite expected
to hear some reference to the London
Water Bill, or a few remarks about the
Select Committee that threw out the Bill
transferring River Steamers to London
County Council.
BEERBOHM TREE crowns the success of
his staging, the triumph of his getting to-
gether such a company, by his rendering
of Malvolio. With many subtle touches
he presents the living man. One little
thing: when the clown is prominently to
the front in conversation with Olivia, the
way the fussy, vain, pompous steward,
touches him with his wand of office, in
indescribable manner indicating posses-
sion and authority over some meaner
thing, is a rarely devised bit of bye-play.

CHAPTER XIII.
Tlie En A of the Season.
ANOTHER season has come to an end. It has, so to speak, run
to earth, and these notes, like pursuing hounds who reach the
qxiarry's hiding-place after an interval, must be regretfully
gathered together and taken home. The hounds will reappear
in all their bravery next autumn—but the notes have done
their work, and are to be kennelled for good.
It has been a good season, well protracted owing to the
backwardness of spring, and horses and hounds have had their
full share of honest work. Frost, the enemy of all good hunting
men, has troubled us but little. Do you remember, years and
years ago, when the flrst flush of a hardy youth was still yours,
when your limbs were springy, and your spirits keen, and your
eyes clear, and your hair still grew close and thick about
your temples, in those far-off delightful days when nothing
seemed to tire you, and when the harder you rode the more
warmly you glowed with the ardour of the run-—do you remem-
ber, I say, how waking in the early morning you blundered
across your bedroom to the window, drew the blind, opened
the window, felt the frost in your face, and realised with a
bitter disappointment that this day, to which you had been
looking forward, was doomed to be a wasted day? However,
you were not going to be defeated without a struggle: .you
shaved—ugh! how the razor scrapes when the mercury has
fallen below 32—you indued your leather breeches, fought
apoplectically with the button-hook, lugged on, even more
apoplectically, your top-boots, felt the buttons of your breeches
pressed deep into your tender leg, but bore the pain unmurmur-
ing; tied your beautiful tie neatly and with despatch; and
then, shining with health and the exertion of dressing, pro-
ceeded to breakfast. Was there any hope of the sun breaking
through in strength sufficient to make hunting possible? Was
the wind about to veer and bring a spurt of rain? Was it
possible that six miles off, at the "Three Tuns," where hounds
were to meet, there might have been no frost at all? These
mitigations of despair chased one another through your mind as
you ate your appointed way through the fried sole, the kidneys
and bacon, the poached eggs, and the concluding marmalade.
"Any good, TOM ?'' you said to the faithful stableman not long
afterwards in the stable.
'Well, Sir, it don't look very cheerful, that's certain; but,
[/or', you never knows your luck. Of course they mayn't bring
lounds out, but then again they may—and if it's anyhow possible
they '11 have a go. Yes, Sir, I '11 have him ready in a minute."
And then, varying between hopes and fears, you rode to the
meet—only to find half-a-dozen enthusiasts like yourself, but
no hounds, and no prospect of them. It was a cruel blow, but
;he justice of the decision was undeniable, for no man of sense
would have imperilled his horse's legs and his own valuable
bones over those iron-bound fields. Yes, frost is the worst
be of the good hunting man, and we may thank our stars that
we have so little of it to spoil sport and keep horses in their
stalls. Years ago, I remember, I passed some days with a fine
old veteran, the keenest man to hounds I ever saw. We had
good sport over a good country. On the morning of my depar-
ture I was surprised by my host with the request that as soon
as I got back to London I should buy for him and send to him
a pair of skates. "What kind?" I asked.
"Oh, any kind; I don't care what they 're like, so long
as they 're skates."
"But I didn't know yon skated."
"I don't—but the weather looks like turning to frost. I 've
tried every sort of dodge, and I 've found that the only way
to keep off frost is to buy a pair of skates. I 've got thirty or
forty pairs of 'em in the lumber-room at the top of the house."
If my memory serves me, on this occasion the fates were
perverse. The old gentleman got his skates in due course,
but he also got a very severe frost, which didn't in the least
diminish his faith in the efficacy of his dodge when another
year came round.
DARBY JONES ON THE CITY AND SUBURBAN.
HONOURED SIR,—When this afternoon I saw a Chestnut Tree
in all the Glory of Verdant Leaf I warbled to Myself, "The
Spring has come, the City and Suburban is at hand." Now
what Affinity there was between the Epsom contest and that
Harbinger of bud and blossom, I cannot pretend to determine.
Perhaps the foliage pointed iu some inscrutable Way to the
Victory of a Chestnut Quadruped over those Downs which
are now as ever free.
I have, honoured Sir, been a constant Patron of this
Meeting, but no one Assembly is more impressed on the
tablets of my memory than that of 1882, when Lord ROSSMORE'S
Passaic annexed the Stake at the remunerative price of 40
to 1. This Event was remarkable to me because, on that
occasion, I noted his lordship's brother, the Houble. PETER
WESTENRA, returning to the Metropolis in a four-wheeled cab,
whereof ,the windows were plastered with Five-pound Notes,
in order, as the Hon. P. explained, "Just to show what an
Irish gentleman could do." I regret to say that I had no
reason for joining in the Hon. Nobleman's enthusiasm.
This year we of the Prophetic Vein have a difficult task be-
fore us. You, Sir, sitting in your Damask Arm Chair little
know the Tortures which a Vates has to endure. Dig and delve
as we may in the Field of Divination, we very likely in the cud
break our Augurial Spade on the Flints of Disappointment.
However, as the 'Bus Driver hath it, "Here goes."
The ^AJfbed looks splendid in print,
But /like the Southern Sid. better,
Mantalini is good for a sprint,
And Charles Wyndham may be an upsetter,
But the Qay Nonconformist should win,
And the Soundmaid has got a good chance,
While Upper Thames gets a look ill,
If only Tin Spec leads the dance.
Such, Honoured Sir, is my Prognostication. Trusting to see you
and your Aristocratic Friends as usual on your Well-appointed
Coach supplied with the Ease and Posse of Conviviality, I am
Your Devoted Henchman and Heeler, DARBY JOKES.

PAINFUL POEMS.—NO. V.
PETER BROWN AND HIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT.
His brain was slightly overwrought
One warm and sunny day,
He fell into a train of thought
Which carried him away.
It was a fairly heavy fall,
And PETER BROWN was dazed;
He could not recollect at all
The scenes on which he gazed.
For swift as thought the train had sped,
Far over sea and land;
The sun was blazing overhead,
The scenery was grand.
But PETER BROWN received a shock!
Before he could divine
What made his Pullman carriage rock,
The train was off the line.
It crumpled up upon its tracks,
He almost broke his neck,
And then a crowd of ugly blacks
Came clamb'ring o'er the wreck.
They tied poor PETER hand and foot,
And bore him to a spot
Where they, alas, were wont to put
Their captives in a pot.
Yes, put them in a pot to boil
For necessary food
With vinegar and salt and oil
(Their cookery was crude).
Oh, who shall tell his horror when
He faced the nigger chief,
All feathers, like a frightened hen,
And black beyond belief?
The blubber lips revealed a flash
Of teeth as white as snow,
And when the teeth began to gnash
Poor PETER wished to go.
But all in vain! A mighty club
The monster heaved on high,
While PETER looked his last on shrub
And tree and earth and sky.
"Farewell," he cried,'' each earthly toy,
To earth itself farewell "—
Then paused, and shouted with a joy
That tongue would fail to tell.
Another train of thought appeared!
Resistless in its course,
The brutal black that PETER feared
It crushed without remorse.
And PETKR next it bore away,
Through realms of pure delight,
To where Trafalgar's fountains play
Each morning, noon and night.
So PETER BROWN was saved, although
His brain was overwrought;'
And cherished with a grateful glow
That second train of thought. F. E.

Bal>s the Impossible (HuTCHlNSON) is our old friend the girl of
The Heavenly Twins, -with new surroundings and another
history. There is not lacking even the faithful, loving brother.
But Montaciite Kingconstance—votla un nom!—does not play so
important a part in the story as did Bobs' earlier brother. As
for Babs, she is just the same, frank, boisterous, beautiful,
sentimental—in a word, impossible. Men fall suddenly in love
•with her, and when two propose, at five minutes' notice, she
expresses desire to marry them both, one for Sundays, the other
for week-days. Marriage, or, to be precise, proposal of
marriage, is, indeed, a constant sequence of daily life in
the community that people Danehnrst. If the men dally, the
women hasten to meet them more than half way. Mr.
Jelli/liond 'fhineji, a barman retired with a fortune, literally has
all the women at his feet, from the aristocratic Mm. King-
eonxtanff of Dane Court to poor poverty-stricken Afins fipiee,
who falls in love with him at sight. My Baronite found
enclosed in his copy of the novel a booklet containing an
"interview" with Mrs. SARAH GRAND, explaining her
purpose in writing. He did not do the gifted lady the
injustice of reading Jthe conversation, fearing lest it should
close the novel to him. A story that needs explaining is not,
as a rule, worth following. Glancing over the " interview,"
he gathered that Mrs. GRAND is of,opinion that women are left
too much to their own resources, whilst their husbands go
gadding about in a gay hut wicked world. That is a matter of
personal, consequently varied, experience. Certainly the
influence of the scarcity of the society of men at Dane-
hurst was not wholesome. Mr*. Kingconttnnce comes as near
the mere animal state as is possible to a well - educated
well-bred woman. Mr. Jellybond Tinney is as impossible as
Babx, and more amusing. When the book reaches—er—a second
edition, Mrs.—er—GRAND will do well—er—to cut out this sort
of—er—thing from the conversation. It is bad enough to have
one of the characters stuttering in meaningless manner. Mrs.
GRAND is so enamoured of the humour of it that she seta
two or three of her puppets at it.
Mr. H. B. IRVING has chosen a nice lively subject for publi-
cation (by Mr. HEiNEMANN) in this sweet spring time, and has
given to a merry world his carefully and somewhat cynically
written SI uiliett of French Criminals. The Baron dipped into some
of the stories of these notorious scoundrels, male and female,
and sincerely wished that Mr. H. B. IRVING had been satisfied
with using these materials for a Harrison-Ainsworth-y Romance
such as i;<m!.,i;,nii, of which that ruffianly highwayman DICK
TCRPIN was the hero, though on calm consideration it is
better to represent crime and criminals just as they are than
to paint them in the bright colouring of an utterly false senti-
ment. The only question is, why not leave ill alone? Why
not leave them at rest in the French Newgate Calendar? For
one thing, Mr. H. B. IRVING, who essayed the white-washing
of Judge JEFFREYS, deserves our gratitude, and that is, he has
not attempted to represent black as white, and all his villains
are of the very deepest dye. THE BARON T>E B.-W.

THE NEW RENAISSANCE.
BY A. C.
rv.
IT is time that I came to the Central Idea of the renaissance.
Personally, I was opposed to the policy of having a Central
Idea ; it seemed to me a trifle bourgeois, but MORIARTY said that
all the best renaissances did have them, and the general feeling
in the Club seemed to be that we couldn't get on without one.
So we drew lots, out of a hat, for the honour of making first
suggestion. Number one was drawn by Professor SKILLIBEG
(author of Fungus Growth*) and we knew that an interesting
half-hour lay before us. The Professor is so original.
He said that he believed we were all palpitating with the
same spirit; the only difficulty was to give it verbal expression.
We few, we happy few, were destined to bring in a new era in
art, in literature, and in morals. We didn't mind (he believed he
expressed the feeling of the majority) -what sort of an era it
was, provided that it was really and truly new. ("Hear, hear!")
Now, most of the epochs in art were marked by a change in the
conception of the Beautiful. We should go deeper than that.
We should abolish the Beautiful as an artistic ideal altogether.
(Slight sensation.) This might seem startling, but he was sure
that it expressed our true feeling. Beauty had had its day, was
played out; we were gradually awakening to the discovery of the
pre-eminent sesthetical value of ugliness. (Murmurs of appro-
bation.) Hitherto even our most advanced spirits had only
ventured to name the Ugly as a sub-species of the Beautiful,
but surely the view of his German friend Herr von KRAUTZMANN,
was the truer—that Beauty was merely a particular and inferior
kind of Ugliness. If only we were true to this ideal a vast
field lay open to us, almost untouched as yet. In the drama
there had been little accomplished. Scandinavia was diffidently,
and perhaps unconsciously, pointing the way; but in our own
country we had got no farther than the production of plays
that were repulsive, and he hoped that none of us were in such
blindness as to confound the repulsive with the truly Ugly. In
music, again, despite the open-air efforts of certain countrymen
of his friend Herr von KRAUTZMANN, little or nothing had been
accomplished. For those of us who worked with brush or
pencil there might perhaps be a smoother path. There were not-
lacking indications that the illustrated papers would give us a
hand, and any really sound work was sure to find a place in the
Royal Academy. But from all quarters we must be prepared to
meet with opposition and even derision. We should have the
name of paradox-mongers thrown in our teeth; we should even
be called decadents by those who failed to distinguish between
the prismatic hues of putridity and the brilliant colours of
unfolding life. But we must persevere. And, finally, if we
would preach Ugliness, let us be ugly. In our characters, he
meant. So far as personal appearance went, it was too late for
some of us to succeed. He was aware—painfully aware—that
he, himself, was not a really ugly man. (Cries of "Question! ")
No, no, that was sheer flattery. He disliked flattery—particu-
larly on this point—and he beggexl us, if we wished to remain
his friends, not to employ it. Some people had told him that
with a little making-up he would do; but it had always seemed
to him the worst of affectations for a man to use artificial means
to enhance his own ugliness. But inward ugliness of the soul
was within the reach of all, and he trusted that no member of
this Club, at all events, would find any difficulty in attaining it.
The Professor sat down amid a tempest of applause.
His idea had quite carried us away. After the meeting was
over and I was about todepart, I heard agonized groans from the
cloak-room. Going in, I discovered that they proceeded from
WlMPLETT, the best-looking man in the Club. He was standing
before a looking-glass, with the marks of despair printed clearly
enough on his handsome face. Over and over again, he mur-
mured the words, "Too late, too late I" It was a pathetic

scene—WIMPLETT'S life tragedy. I slipped out noiselessly and
went home.
V.
THE Chairman had impressed upon us very carefully, that
although we were to be a subtle, insidious, permeating
influence, entirely devoid of vulgar ostentation, yet we were
never to shrink, if the occasion demanded it, from openly
asserting our gospel of Ugliness. Silent action was a noble
thing, but much might also be done by the spoken word. We
were somewhat surprised, when, at the next meeting of the
Committee, the Chairman turned up with a bandage over his
right eye. "Gentlemen," he began, almost as soon as he
entered the room, " I am now in a position to confirm what I
said last time about the spoken word. Much may be done by
it—much." We pressed sympathetically for details, and after
some attempts at evasion, the Chairman gave them. "Gentle-
men," he said, "there is a
certain bishop of my acquaint-
ance, whose name I refrain
from mentioning although you
can probably guess it. I have
known him for years, but never
until lately have I appreciated
sufficiently his aesthetical value.
Gentlemen, he is the ugliest
man in England, perhaps in
Europe." (We knew now of
whom he was speaking, and
cast meaning glances at one
another.) "He is blessed with
a wife and six children, all of
equal personal attractions, and
yet he has never appeared a
really happy man. Now,
thought 1, if only he were to
embrace our renaissance doc-
trines, what a difference it
would make to him! Gentle-
men, I went to that bishop: I
got into pleasant conversation
with him: I led the talk to-
wards Art. Gradually I began
to unfold to him the elements
of the truth. He seemed hardly
to comprehend, so I stated at
some length and with much lucidity the doctrine of Ugliness
for Ugliness' sake. Finally, gentlemen, carried away by my
theme, I burst into a fervent personal appeal. 'Embrace our
faith,' I said, 'and life will become a different thing to you.
Only realise the sesthetical supremacy of Ugliness, and every
time you glance at these noble portraits of your ancestors you
will feel a thrill of the purest joy: every time you gaze upon
the faces of your little ones you will experience an artistic
treat: every time you look in the mirror you will have a feast
of zesthetic delight!' Could I have put it more clearly, gentle-
men?" Certainly he could not. "And yet the bishop did not
understand. 'Young man,' he said, 'there are two ways out of
this room: the door and the window. I recommend the door.'
I had feared already that the sudden access of light was merely
dazzling his mental vision. Now he appeared to be growing
unintelligible, so I felt it both kinder and wiser to withdraw."
Here the Chairman abruptly sat down. There were various
cries of "What about that "bandage?" "Did the bishop do
it?" "Gentlemen," said the Chairman without rising, " I had
wished to draw a veil over the bandage. The incidents which
gave rise to it were not to the credit of my friend the bishop.
If you must know, however, there was a slight interlude
between my determination to leave the bishop and my actual
accomplishment of that purpose. As I said before, much may
be done by the spoken word. But let me advise you, gentle-

THE RECOVERED GAINSBOROUGH.
men, to find out, before you speak it, whether the other man is
a boxer."
Before the meeting closed, MoRIARTY caused some sensation
by getting up to propose a vote of thanks to the bishop. On
his reasons being demanded, he snid that, at all events, the
gentleman in question had, according to renaissance principles,
infinitely improved the personal appearance of our Chairman.
Considering the graceful nature of the compliment, and the fact
that it came from MORIAHTY, who is in some sense a rival of his,
I thought the Chairman might have seemed more pleased.
VI.
"An, really good renaissances," said MORIARTY—MORIARTY
had a way of talking about renaissances as if he had spent his
life amongst them: sometimes one could hardly help suspecting
that he kept half-a-dozen or so in his back-yard—"all really
good renaissances have a lead-
ing spirit. How about ours?"
The question was a momentous
one, and the Club went into
committee about it at once.
After some preliminary discus-
sion it was decided to ballot
for the leadership. This, in
spite of violent protest from
SMALLEY, who thought that
nothing but time and the public
verdict could possibly decide
such a question. SMALLEY knew
that he wouldn't have a chance
in the ballot. We none of us
liked SMALLEY. He proved so
obstreperous now that at last
the Chairman was obliged to
ask MORIARTY to sit on him,
which MORIARTY did effectu-
ally. As soon as the muffled
cries had ceased, we pro-
ceeded to ballot. The result
was unfortunately indecisive.
"Gentlemen," said the Chair-
man, "I find in the hat,
twenty-three slips of paper,
bearing twenty-three different
names—invaluable as a collec-
tion of autographs, but as a poll—unsatisfactory. Perhaps,
before balloting again, we had better clear the ground by a
little discussion on general lines." So we discussed. Professor
SKILLIBKG, M.A.Oxon., gave it as his view that-the ideal
leader should be an experienced, middle-aged man, who com-
bined philosophical with artistic attainments, and could further
the movement in one of our great educational centres.
WIMPLETT, the playwright, held that for bringing ideas before
the public there was nothing like the stage: the Twentieth
Century Renaissance would most naturally crystallise round a
second SHAKSPEARE. And so on. I, myself, thought that, con-
sidering the enormous influence of the daily and weekly press,
a writer of short articles would have most chance of reaching
the minds of the people. The discussion appeared likely to
end as the ballot had done, when MORIARTY, without removing
his fourteen-stone avoirdupois from its resting-place above the
refractory member, spoke winged words. "It strikes me," he
said, "that we are altogether on the wrong tack. We should
not choose one of ourselves, or, at all events, not one now
living. It would give much more freedom to the public imagi-
nation if we were to set up as our idol and leader some rare
genius who had departed this world with his life-work unfinished,
and had bequeathed to us the carrying out of his great ideas."
"Good!" cried several members.
"Whom do you propose?" cried others.

[APRIL 24, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
There was silence for a few moments. Then said WIMPLETT,
"How about SMALLEY?"
MORIARTY rose to his feet and disclosed SMALLEY lying very
flat and still in the bottom of the arm-chair.
"He died young," said MORIARTY, regarding the body with a
pensive shake of the head. We rose involuntarily from our
seats, as he went on with a gentle eloquence inspired by the
deep emotion of the moment. "He died young; in his prime,
or even before it; with the larger part of his unique genius
still undeveloped. He left few works, and those few are of
value rather as a magnificent promise than as actual achieve-
ments. It is in the lives and works of his small but admiring
circle of friends that we must look for his life and work. If
ever he was ambitious to become the leader of the New Move-
meat, that ambition is richly and abundantly realised. His
bodily presence is no longer with us, but his spirit is the spirit
of the Twentieth Century."
It was a flue, tableau, suggestive of ANTONY and JULIUS C.-ESAR.
A murmur of intense emotion ran round the room. And then—
nobody can quite tell how it happened—we found STARK, the
ejected member of the Club, standing in our midst. He had a
dangerous, unpleasant look. We were so much disgusted by
his intrusion, that nobody stirred or spoke; and a minute later
he was driving off with the body of our Leader in a hansom cab.
VII.
AT first it seemed as if, for once, SMALLGY had done a really
smart thing. His decease provided our movement with an
ideal Leading Spirit. It is always an advantage to have your
leading spirit (a) young, and (b) dead. Then he will never
embarrass you by doing anything; he will never lose romance
by growing fat; and he can be venerated at a smaller sacrifice
of self-respect, the halo seeming more natural when the top-
hat has been finally discarded.
In SMALLEY'S case there were exceptional advantages; for
he had left no finished works to speak of, so that we could
safely attribute to him any ideas that came into our heads,
just as PLATO did with poor old SOCRATES after the hemlock
episode. (And one would like to be assured, by the bye, that
PLATO himself didn't have a hand in the brewing of that
hemlock!)
But, alas! that we should ever have trusted such a "man.
He and STARK between them broke up the Club. McCASKILL's
memoir of SMALLEY had just been published and had created
an enormous sensation, and we were holding a most successful
banquet, at which all the men of light and leading in art and
literature were present, when the dastardly blow was dealt.
MORIAHTY was on his feet, holding the well-dined company
entranced with an exposition of our Leader's ideas on art.
"We feebly endeavour," he said, "to follow in his footsteps.
Would that he himself were here to guide us!" And then
the door opened, and in walked STARK and SMALLEY, arm-in-
arm! I shall not attempt to describe the sensation. It was
horrible. SMALLEY took a horrid big pipe out of his mouth,
nodded and grinned diabolically.
"Glad to see you fellers again," he said. "I see by your
bright faces how you 've been sorrowing for me. Daresay you
didn't know that I suffer from trances; have done ever since I
was a boy. But I 'in nil right again, now. Come! this is jolly."
We had always known that SMALLGY' was not a gentleman;
but no one had ever suspected him of possessing such a shifty,
uncertain character. We sat and stared in silence whilst he
helped himself to port. Our guests showed their delicacy by
dropping quietly out of the room one by one. When they were
all gone, STARK, who had been grinning from behind
MCCASKILL'S chair, turned to SMALLEY.
"Come, old man. We must be going." As they reached the
door, he looked over his shoulder. "I knew you 'd all be
pleasantly surprised. Such a relief to MORIARTY in particular!
But I 'm sorry the Club 's closing."
The next morning I received an urgent call to the United
States. On my way to the station, I passed the Club. The
shutters were up, and there was a piece of paper fastened by
four drawing-pins on the door just below the knocker. I
mounted the steps to examine it. Upon it was printed, in bold
characters, the announcement :•—
"THGRG WILL BE NO RENAISSANCE NEXT CENTURY.
By order, J. SMALLEY."
But BRODIE still keeps the accounts. He keeps them so well
that nobody knows where they are; nor where he is.
RAMSGATE AND TRAMGATK.
SIR,—Your own Holiday Tour Commissioner has returned
from his Kent Coast mission, and inageneralway reports" All 's
well." He wishes to remark on a paragraph that recently
appeared in your paper, under date April 10, as to a certain
"Tramgirt Island." Sir, that island—if that island be, as
your Commissioner takes it to be, the Isle of Thanet, then
permit him to inform you that at present it is not tram-girt,
and very far from being so. But that they are on the Trampage
between Margate or Cargate, Rainsgate or Tramgate, and
Switchington or Birchingtou, "there ain't," as our dear old
Mrs. GAMP would have said, "no deniging of it, BETSY!"
But in spite of bad tobacco and all the savoury scents and
smells that accompany the partially washed to their favourite
holiday resorts at certain brief seasons of the year, the splendid
air of Thanet, north and south, remains the same salubrious
health-giving, refreshing, invigorating tonic that has always
been its peculiar characteristic. 'Arries and 'Arriets, et hoc
genus omne, may patronise these trams, if they find it is
advantageous to them so to do, in passing from Cargate to
Tramgate, and vice versa, and so it may eventuate that the
cars, the four-in-hands, the vans, waggonettes, and other
vehicles that "kick up a dust" and ply for hire, "wet or
shine," may suffer, but not the line, neither the L. C. & D. nor

time, and, as your Commissioner believes, charging rather less,
or, at all events, not more than the rushing, crawling, curving,
slowing, speeding, stopping, ascending, descending tram.
"There 's air!" is the cry at Ramsgate, even though the place
be temporarily converted into " Tramgate," and it is not to be
dispelled by this Yellow Monster (for such is the nice restful
colour of these tramcars, whose shape is certainly ungainly) that
is not yet under perfect control, and not inclined to invariably
obey the guidance of the conductor, conduct he never so wisely.
There are more St. Georges than one in Thanet, land" possessors,
who oppose the advance of the Tram Dragon (quite a Snap-
dragon in the way of collaring and swallowing up the land left
and right), and who, champions of right against might, are
regarded by some of the very advanced school much as the
civilised westerns were wont to look upon the Celestials \vho
opposed the incursion of the Locomotive into the Lotus-Land
of the Yellow Peril and China-Blue Puzzle.
The railways at all events may safely sing " We fear no foe,"
and those who love the Island of Rest (with exceptions of Bank
Holiday unrest), may safely seek their old sea-side resorts
iin-fram-melled, and sing, not only "Begone, dull care," but
also, to the same old tune,
"Begone, bright ear;
I prithee begone without me .'

ONE OF THE
NEW SCHOOL.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
—I see from some
of the papers that
all the London
Schools are falling
off, and one of the
head - masters de-
clares it's because
there is too much
Greek and too little
country air. I
think that's rather
rot, myself. Sure
enough about the
Greek, but then a
chap needn't learn
it unless he likes.
In fact, a chap
needn't learn any-
thing unless it
pleases him. I
never do.
And as to the
country air!
That 's precious
rot, too. Surely
you get plenty of
sunshine at Ham-
mersmith and Cat-
ford, and even at
Westminster. Vin-
cent Square, now
that the slums
have been cleared
away to make room
for the coming
Cathedral is open
enough for any-
body. It 's first-
rate for footer,
and splendid for
cricket. Then why
write rot about
London Schools
falling off on ac-
count of compul-
sory Greek and prohibited country air?
Strikes me, if they are falling off, it's on
account of the parents not being able to
stump up. I know my father has been
hit by the extra income tax. So, coming
to this conclusion, it strikes me it's the
duty of every fellow who thinks he knows
enough—and who doesn't?—to take the
matter in his own hands and bolt.
Yours filially and patriotically,

DRAMATIC SEQUELS.
X.—THE THIRD MRS. TANQUERAY.
SCENE — The Dining - room of AUBREY
TANQOBRAY's country house, Higher-
combe, in Surrey. A lean butler is
standing at the sideboard. AUBREY
and CAYLEY DRUMMLE enter and go up
to warm themselves at the fire, which
burns feebly. The time is an evening
in March, five years after tlie events of
Mr. PINERO'S play, and CAYLEY loofcs
quite five years stouter. AUBREY does
not.
Cayieu. IT '8 quite shocking, AUBREY,
that you should have been married nearly
a year, and that I should not yet have had
the pleasure of making Mrs. TANQUERAY'S
acquaintance. I am dying to know her.
Aubrey. My fault, my dear CAYLEY.
Cayley. Entirely. Your weddings are
always so furtive.
[Pokes the fire resolutely, in the hope of
producing something approaching
a cheerful blaze.
Aubrey. Well, you '11 see her to-night.
I hoped she would be able to dine at home,
but she had promised to address a Tem-
perance meeting in the village. (CAYLEY
looks dubious.) However, she '11 be back
at ten. Meanwhile, you '11 have to be
contented with a bachelor dinner.
[Tliey go to the table and sit doum.
Cayley (unfolding serviette). Experience
has taught me, my dear AUBREY, that
bachelor dinners are apt to be particularly
well worth eating. No doubt it is to
make up for the absence of more charming
society.
Aubrey (doubtfully). I hope it will prove
so in this case.
Cayley. I feel sure of it. I remember
your cook of old.
Aubrey. I 'm afraid it won't be that cook.
Cayley (in horror). You haven't parted
with him?
Aubrey. Yes. He left soon after my
marriage. There was some small error in
his accounts, which Mrs. TANQUERAY
discovered. So, of course, we had to
dismiss him.
Cat/ley (eagerly). Do yon happen to have
his address?
Aubrey. I dare say Mrs. TANQUERAY has,
if you wish to know it.
[Footman hands soup.
Cayley. I shall be eternally indebted to
her.
Aubrey. Why?
Cayley. I shall engage him at once.
(Begins to eat his soup, frowns, and then
puts down his spoon) But I 'm afraid you '11
want him back yourself.
Aubrey. No. My wife is most particular
about tho character of her servants.
Cayley. Ah! I 'm more particular about
the character of my soup.
[His hand goes out instinctively towards
his sherry-glass. As he is about to
raise it he sees that it is empty, and
refrains.
Aubrey. CAYLEY, you ought to marry.
Then you 'd realise that there are more
important things in the world than soup.
Cayley. Of course there are, my dear
fellow. There 's the fish and the joint.
[Fish of an unattractive kind is handed
to him. He takes some.
Aubrey. Sybarite!
[CAYLEY loofcs at his fish dubiously.
Then leaves it untasted.
Cayley. You are quite wrong. A simple
cut of beef or mutton, well-cooked, is
quite enough for me.
Butler (to CAYLEY). Lemonade, Sir?
Cayley. Eh, what? No thank you.
Aubrey. Ah, CAYLEY. What will you
drink? (CAYLEY'S face brightens visibly.)
I 'm afraid I can't offer you any wine.
(It falls again.) My wife never allows al-
cohol at her table. But there are various
sorts of mineral waters. You don't mind?
Cayley (grimly.) Not at all, my dear
fellow, not at all. Which brand of
mineral water do you consider most—
ah—stimulating?
Aubrey (laughing mirthlessly). I 'm afraid,
CAYLEY, you're not a convert to Tem-
perance principles yet. That shows you
have never heard my wife speak.
Cayley (emphatically). Never! Tem-
perance meetings are not in my line.
[Footman removes his plate.
Aubrey. Perhaps some of the other
movements in which she is interested
would appeal to you more. (With a touch
of happy pride) As you may know, my
wife is a vice-president of the Anti-
Vaccination Society, and of the Woman's
Home Rule Union. Indeed, she is in
great request on all public platforms.
Cayley (with simulated enthusiasm). I
feel sure of that, my dear ADBREY. (Foot-
man hands CAYLEY some rice-pudding.
CAYLEY put* up his eije-glass, and eyes it
curiously.) What is this?
.F'ootma?!. Rice-pudding, Sir.
[CAYLEY drops spoon hastily.
Aubrey (politely). You 're eating no-
thing, CAYLEY.
Cayley (with some ' concern). AUBREY,
have I slept through the joint? I have
no recollection of eating it. If, in a
moment of abstraction, I refused it, may
I change my mind?
Aubrey (sternly). My wife never has
meat at her table on Fridays.
Cayley (peevishly). My dear fellow, I
wish you 'd thought of mentioning it
before I came down. Then I might have
had a more substantial luncheon. Where's
that rice-pudding?
[Helps himself. There is a rather con-
strained silence.
Aubrey. It's really very good of you
to have come down to see us, CAYLEY.
Cayley (pulling himself together). Very
good of you to say so, my dear chap.
[Tackles Ms rice-pudding manfully.
Aubrey. My wife and I can so seldom
get any man to drop in to dinner nowa-
days.
Cayley (giving up his struggle with rice-
pudding in despair). I suppose so.
Aubrey. In fact, wo see very little
society now.
Cayley (sententiouslij). Society only
likes people who feed it, my dear Au-
BREY. You ought to have kept that
cook.
Aubrey (meditatively). So my daughter
said.
Cayley. ELLEAN? Is she with yon now?
Aubrey. No. She is in Ireland. After
making that remark she went back to
her convent.
Cayley (heartily). Sensible girl! I like
ELLEAN.
Aubrey. She and my wife did not get
on, somehow. It was very unfortunate,
as it was mainly on ELLEAN'S account
that I thought it right to marry again.
Cayley (with polite incredulity). Indeed?
Aubrey. Yes. You see, it is so difficult
for a girl of ELLEAN'S retiring disposition
to meet people and make friends when
she has no mother to chaperon her. And
if she meets no one, how is she to get
married? Dessert, CAYLEY?
Cayley (after surveying a rather unattrac-
tive assortment of apples and ttwlnuts).
No, thanks. As you were saying?
Aubrey. So I thought if I could meet
with a really suitable person, someone
with whom she would be in sympathy,
someone she would look upon as a sort
of second mother
Cayley (correcting him). Third, AUBREY.
.Aubrey (ignoring the interruption)
it would make home more comfortable for
her.
Cayley (laughing). I like your idea of
comfort, AUBREY! But I should have
thought you could have'adopted some less
extreme measure for providing ELLEAN
with a chaperon? Yon have neighbours.
Mrs. CORTELYON, for instance?
Aubrey (stiffly). Mrs. CORTELYON'S
chaperonage was not very successful on
the last occasion.
Cayley. No, no; to be sure. Young
ARDALE. I was forgetting.
Aubrey. Unhappily the whole scheme
was a failure. ELLEAN conceived a violent
aversion for Mrs. TANQUERAY almost
directly we came home, and a week later
—I remember it was directly after dinner
—she announced her intention of leaving
the house for ever.
Cayley (the thought of his dinner still
rankling). Poor girl! No doubt she's
happier in her convent.
Butler enters with coffee. CAYLEY takes
some.
Aubrey. I am sorry I can't ask you to
smoke, CAYLEY, but my wife has a par-
ticular objection to tobacco. She is a
member of the Anti-tobacco League, and
often speaks at its meetings.

tions that now I hardly notice them. Of
course, it's different with you.

Aubrey. You can't go to-night. The
last train leaves at 9.80. It's 9.15 now.
Cayley (jumping up). Then I must start
at once. Send my bag after me.
Aubrey. You've not a chance of catch-
ing it.
Cayley (solemnly). My dear old friend, I
shall return to town to-night if I have to
walk!
Aubrey (detaining him). But my wife?
You haven't even made her acquaintance
yet. She '11 think it so strange.
Cayiey. Not half so strange as I have
thought her dinner. (Shaking himself free)
No, AUBREY, this is really good-bye. I
like you very much, and it cuts me to the
heart to have to drop your acquaintance;
but nothing in the world would induce me
to face another dinner such as I have had
to-night!

SUGGESTIONS TO SHORTEN CRICKET
MATCHES.
(By one who admires sport but loves
luncheon.)
1. LET the batsmen go in fetters, and
extend the distance between the wickets
to a quarter of a mile.
2. Have two bowlers at each end, and
allow them to bowl simultaneously.
8. Increase the field of the outs to
twenty-two, and allow only six of the ins
to go in, chosen by lot—not by ballot.
4. Have six stumps at each end, double
the height of those in present use and
four inches from each other, so as to ex-
tend the area of the wicket.
5. Let the bat be abolished in favour of
the broom-stick.
0. Instruct umpires to treat every
application in the most favourable sense
to the outs.
7. Let overs become less numerous by
permitting their length to be limited by
the bowlers.
8. On reaching twenty runs, let the
innings of a batsman be closed.
9. Abolish "no balls" and let the match
come to an end when declared by a tenth
of the spectators as "tedious."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A GREAT THOUGHT FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR.
SECOND SERIES.
IV.—THE "BRIDGE" SECTION.
(Continued from April.)
16TH.—In my treatise on Whist I have devoted a chapter to
"The Conversation of the Game," showing that information
may be conveyed to your partner (if he happens to be paying
attention) and at the same time to your opponents (invariably
on the alert), without employment of the living voice, or pressure
of feet beneath the table (the latter a device never resorted to
except in the family circle or where the game is played for
Love and Love only). But it will bo obvious that in "Bridge,
where open conversation is encouraged within certain limits,
the opportunities for conveying information will be less
restricted. To a recognition of this fact we may trace what
are known as the Conventions of Bridge.
17TH.—Success in Bridge, as in morality, depends upon a
right appreciation of the Conventions.
18TH.—The Conventions of Bridge (not to be confused with the
Council of Trent, and still less with that of Trente-et-un) are
in the fluid stage which precedes crystallisation. Pending
the establishment of a Great Bridge Trust (one of the humane
objects of the recent PAUNCEFOTE-HAY negotiations, which aim
at a better understanding between the two great branches of
the Anglo-Saxon family), it is found convenient, when strangers
are present, to make a preliminary comparison of Principles
with a view to mutual adjustment. In Bridge, as in morality
once more, it is the universal view that a person who differs
from you in Principles might as well be without them altogether.
19rH.—It is my desire in this monograph to extend the scope
and utility of Conventions. Thus, there is a Convention by
which, when your adversaries have declared No Trumps (the
lead being with 'your partner), and you announce your inten-
tion of doubling the stakes, your partner is to understand
that you desire Hearts to be led to you. Now it may very
well happen that you wish to double on the strength of a
hand to which Hearts contribute no portion of its vitality.
You hold, let us say, a top sequence of ten Clubs, with the
four of Spades, the three of Diamonds, and the deuce of Hearts,
all single. Let us suppose for the sake of argument that eleven
of the remaining Hearts, including all the court cards of that
suit, lie between your adversaries. It is natural and right for
you to wish to double with ten Club tricks in your hand; it
is equally natural and right that you should shrink from having
Hearts led to you. Plainly, the accepted Convention would
here be misleading, and might in the result go far to impair
the harmonious relations, if any, existing between yourself and
your partner.
Yet, if Conventions are good, the more you have of them the
better; for by a wise enlargement of the field of information
you come within measurable distance of the highest ideal
namely, the treble dummy game, where there is no human possi-
bility of concealment or evasion.
218T.—The following No-Trump Conventions, approved by
the Majority report of the Royal Commission on Bridge (nol
least among the splendid achievements of the present Parlia-
ment), are already gaining acceptance in Turf circles :—
"I double " ; lead Hearts.
"I propose to double "; lead Diamonds.
"I duplicate "; lead Clubs.
"I propose to duplicate "; lead Spades.
22ND.—Much, again, may be done by modulation of the voice
if you possess an elastic organ. Thus, when your dexter ad ver
sary has dealt, and it is incumbent on you either to double or
to ask, "May I play ?"—if your hand is not quite good enough
to justify your doubling, but you would be gratified to see thai
course adopted by your partner, a tone of enterprise should be
nfused into the phrase, implying that you would welcome a
divergence from ordinary routine. On the other hand, a
merely formal recital of the question, made as if only one answer
were possible, implies that the extreme weakness of your own
land compels you to discourage unnec SFsary speculation.
23RD.—The obvious device of hesi'atlon suggests that yon
lave strength, though not excessive, in your adversary's trumps,
and are practically calling for them to be led through to you;
while the simple addition of the word partner—" May I play,
partner ?" might convey, in the case of a red trump being de-
lared, that you are strong in the other red suit.
24TH.—Again, the bald statement, "I leave it to you,"
admits of picturesque colouring. If you make this announce-
ment with a rapidity too great to admit of your having sorted
your hand, your partner should understand that you hold a
carte blanclie without aces. Unless, therefore, he has six
certain tricks and a possible seventh in his own hand ho will
be well advised to declare Spades, and minimise your losses,
[f, however, you leave it to him reluctantly after a protracted
pause, he should gather that yon were within an ace (probably a
red ace) of going No Trumps.
2oTH.—Variations in the title by which you address your
partner may throw further light on the features of your hand.
A few rules are here thrown out tentatively, but they may
easily be revised and supplemented. Thus :—" I leave it to
you, Sir (or Madam)," might imply that you hold four Hearts,
with two honours.
"I leave it to you, JONES (or Miss SMITH)," might imply that
you hold four Diamonds with two honours.
"I leave it to you" (here adding your partner's Christian
name when you are on terms of familiarity) might imply that
you hold five small Hearts.
"I leave it to you" (here adding your partner's Christian
name without the justification of previous intimacy) might
imply that you hold five small Diamonds. And so on.
26TH.—Winking and other facial contortions are rightly
viewed with disapprobation among the elite; and a man cj
sensitive honour will even avoid looking directly in bis
partner's face lest ho should unwittingly cause offence. But
by an appropriate physical movement you may convey informa-
tion to your partner, even while his eyes are riveted upon his
own cards. Thus, when you hold an overwhelming No-Trump
hand, an uncontrollable restlessness and wriggling of the body
will suggest to him that you arc anxious to have it left to you
On the contrary, when you hold a hand that is mediocre and
lacking in character, by the adoption of an attitude of coyness
(so becoming in a woman when she wishes to encourage a pro-
posal of marriage) you will imply that it is for yonr partner
and not for you to make a declaration.
27TH.—So far I have spoken of various methods of conventions
collusion, as between your partner and yourself. I have now
to speak of the use of finesse for the purpose of throwing dnsi
in your adversaries' eyes. Finesse, which is commonly shown
by the playing of a false card (the word false is not here uset
in the same sense as in the phrase " a false nose," and does no
suggest the introduction of a card from another pack, which is
always a reprehensible, and often a dangerous, feat), may also
be employed, as in Poker, through the medium of intonation or
physical attitude. Thus, when the selection of trumps is left to
you, and you are forced to declare Spades, having three inferio
cards of that suit and practically nil outside it, do not make
your declaration till after a show of mature reflection, and the
apparent sacrifice of valour to discretion. Your adversaries
will then hesitate to double, in the belief that your decision
was dictated by prudence or cowardice.
20TH.—Similarly, when the declaration is left in your hands
and you are 0 up to your opponents' 20, and you hold the ace
queen, 10, 8, 0, 4, of Hearts, with a nice strength in the plain
suits, you should glance at the score, shrug yonr shoulders
and declare Hearts in the manner of one who addresses himsel

to a, forlorn hope with the courage born of despair. Then
the adversary on your right may be tempted to double with the
king, knave, 9, 7, 5 of trumps, and you will be comfortably
over him all the time, and have a trump to spare at the
end.
SOrH.—Finally, not very much can be made of the words "I
am content," when your opponents have doubled. Bntitisstill
possible to impart to the expression a tone of gratuitously noble
resignation. Thus, when your opponents' score is 2 to your 24,
and your declaration of Spades from a deplorably feeble hand
is doubled, and in the issue they run out with a Grand Slam, the
moving recitation of that pathetic phrase (like BEATRICE CENCI'S

to her execution) should linger in the memory and haply purify

Edinburgh, takes the Queen's shilling, is drafted to South Africa,
and saves the life of IVOR MALCOLM, who is, of course, his success-
ful rival for the hand of the pretty girl aforesaid. My Baronite,
however, finds the honours of heroship divided between old
General MALCOLM and his sometime comrade the Chaplain who,
settling down after many campaigns, administers spiritual
comfort to the congregation at Aberfourie. These ancient
comrades, the overbearing General accustomed to command,
the Chaplain never losing sight of his former state of sub-
ordination, are excellently drawn. The story, it will be per-
ceived, is up to date. One of the episodes providing
opportunity for a vivid sketch is the engagement with the
Boers in which General WAUCHOPE fell, and the Highland
Brigade was nearly wiped out.
Under thinly veiled disguises Mr. MORICE GERARD deals In
The Queen's Mate (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) with a recent
royal marriage that attracted friendly interest throughout
Europe, and gave deep delight to the Dutch. With practised art
he has invested the matter-of-fact with the glamour of
romance. His HELENA is the most charming of girl-queens.
The man of her heart's choice has a pretty trick of obtaining
honourable and useful scars in heroic enterprises. My Baronite
does not particularly care for the princely pretender to the
Queen's hand, the handsome nominee of the imperious Emperor
of GRAMOND. He is a rather melodramatic prince of the price-
coloured-twopence type. But he is made a principal actor in
an exceedingly dramatic episode, boldly conceived and ad-
mirably told. The gentle reader will find it worth looking for
in chapter seven.
In The Mystery of the Clasped Hands (F. V. WHITE & Co.),
a decidedly attractive title, Mr. GUY BOOTHBY gives us a fairly
interesting "detective" story, which the author might have
made far more sensational had he followed the elaborate
method of Gaboriau in the elucidation of the mystery, instead
of wasting time over very ordinary love-making, in which occurs
an episode, neither absolutely novel nor remarkably original,
representing the lovely heroine being thrown off her horse
and into the "saving clause" of her lover's arms. The
sketches of the sharp criminal lawyer and genial detective
arc good, and the whole story will serve to pass away an hour
or two pleasantly. THE BAKON DB B>.W-

THE "LIONESS COMIQUE."
THERE's a lady to be met with in every
class and set,
Whom Nature has endowed with tongue
and cheek;
All day long and every day she performs
a sort of play—
Let us christen her the Lioness
Comique.
She will take—and keep—the stage, sole
attention will engage,
Leaving no one else a line of "fat" to
speak;
She will mimic, pose, and chaff, while
the rest have but to laugh
And to listen to the Lioness Coinique.
There is here and there a caitiff, dull
and unappreciative,
Who will greet her jests with laughter
thin and bleak,
And will say that though she's harmless she 's an altogether
charmless
And unnecessary Lioness Comique.
A mere man, you take yo'. oath! He 's fool, or knave, or
both!
Disregard him—his remarks are Jue to pique;
For all men of taste or sense must of course derive immense
Satisfaction from the Lioness Comique.
You shall seek, when sad or ill, no old-fashioned draught or pill,
Nor vainly, O my brothers, shall you seek
A panacea, if you care to, for all ills that flesh is heir to,
In the sallies of the Lioness Comique.
Any miserable " bloke," with his heart or pocket "broke,"
Should forget his woes by spending, say, a week
'Mid the stimulating quips that are ever on the lips
Of the effervescing Lioness Comique!
HENEICUS IRVINGIUS COB10LANUS.
HAD Doctors LKMPRIERE and SMITH been classical authorities
in SHAKSPEARB'S time, that eminent dramatic poet might have
had to defend his "quantities" in pronouncing Coriolanus.
Genius is above rules, and therefore SHAKSPEARE pronounced
Coriolanus, "Coriolanus " (for all the world as if the Roman
hero were a gentleman of Hibernian extraction, descending from
one Mr.CoRRYO'LANUS)or "CorlOlftnus" or "Cori61anus," just
as the fit of inspiration took him. No doubt about it, that for
dignity "Cdri61anus of Corlftli " sounds a grander title than
"Marcus Curtius Cdridlanus " or " Coriftlanus." However, be
that as it may, Mr. BARNES, Mr. LUGO, and other talented
members of the Lyceum Company to whose lot it may fall to
pronounce the name of this hero, give it with true Shakspearian
independence. The play is magnificently placed on the stage
by the eminent designer Sir ALMA TADEMA, Pictor Classicus,
R.A., and the action throughout is descriptively and sympa-
thetically accompanied by that great classical commander
ALEXANDER, yclept the melodious equea Sir A. C. MACKENZIE,
Compositor Dulciganus.
As a play Coriolanus is wearisome to read, the hero being
what ROBBIE BURNS would have styled a "rantin', roarin' boy,"
only, of coarse, not under the influence of any spirits save his
own, many degrees above proof. What a splendid football
player would Carry (to deal with his name briefly and fami-
liarly) have been in this "so-called" twentieth century I Most
decidedly, " rantin' and roarin' " has been the method adopted
by those great actors that up to now have grappled with the
part. But not so is it with Sir HENRY, who recognises in him
the lucky general whose prestige is a terror to his foes, while
as a man he is rough, breezy, short-tempered, warm-hearted,
and impulsive; a hot-headed youth, in fact, who has not been
so long away from school as to have in the slightest degree
acquired the worldly polish of diplomacy. It is for this reason
that he is so violently angry with Tulltis Aufidius for con-
temptuously styling him " Boy!" It is evidently from rolling-
eye'd, sulkily muttering, honied-tonguc'd Tullus Aufidius, as a
type of the ancient melodramatic villains, that Mr. Lenville,
when alluding to the ladies of the Company, who were to a
petticoat on the side of Nicholas Nickleby on the latter being
challenged by the tragedian, addressed him with "But they
shall not protect ye—boy!"
Coriohmiis, however, does not treat Titllus as Nicholas treated
the leading tragedian of the Crummies' company, on whom he
smiled pleasantly, and when Mi-. Lenvillf approached Nicholas
with the avowed intention of pulling his nose, Nicholas, "with-
out the smallest discomposure, knocked him down."
But this wouldn't have suited Mr. WILLIAM SHAKSPEAHE, who
makes the term "boy" so opprobrious to our excitable Carry
that he utterly loses his temper, just proving that ho is a boy;
and that Tulltis knew Carry's weak point, and so it follows
that Corri/, by advancing threateningly, offers the crafty
Volscian the very opportunity he has been seeking, and of
which the assassins at once avail themselves. Marvellously
effective is this final scene as played by Sir HENRY and the
determined murderers led by Mr. MARSDEN as Lieutenant to the
scowling Tullus Aufldius Lenville, as represented by Mr. ASH-
CROFT of the Carker-like gleaming teeth. It is a most effective
finish to a severely classic play.
The lights and shades of the character of the impulsive
Roman are admirably brought out by Sir HENRY, so that, when
the violent tempest of his wrath has suddenly ceased, and he
takes to his heart the tenderly clinging Virgilia (Miss MABEL
HACKNEY), his most sweet and gentle wife, he seems to intro-
duce into the drama that love interest of which, otherwise, it
would be so entirely devoid.
Never could the clever, beautiful, and still youthful matron,
mother of Coriolnims (we can gauge Corry's age by this), have
been more perfectly represented than she is now by Miss ELLEN
TERRY as Volnmnia. Whether sewing at home, going out
shopping with her charming companion Valeria (Miss MAUD
MILTON), rousing her son up to the sticking point, on her knoes
beseeching him, Miss TERRY is admirable.
When care has been taken to render the representation of
every part as perfect as possible, as is the case at the Lyceum,
then, after the two principals, and after the stage-manager,
who is mainly represented by the crowds vigorously and artis-
tically led by four thoroughly Roman citizens, of the Leices-
terus Squarus typo (viz., DODSWORTHUS, BOWNUS, KENNEICS and
REYNOLDSUS), Mr. J. H. BARNES, perfectly made up for the part
and as perfectly playing Mene.nitts Agrippa, with the two (Ed lies
of the people, Sicinius Velutus (Mr. JAMES HEARN), and Junius
Brutus (Mr. LAURENCE IRVING, most artistic as in his make-up
so in his and touch of character), are the most notable for the
flashes of true comedy with which they from time to time en-
lighten this drama, with which the public is unfamiliar, there
being so few "quotations" in it. Certainly, rarely has Mr.
BARNES played more artistically than in his rendering of
Menenius.
After reading the report of the rather stormy meeting of the
Lyceum Company Limited, it is not difficult to imagine Junius
Brutus and Sicinius Velutus as the leaders of the turbulent and
dissatisfied shareholders; while, as Cominius, the devoted
friend of Corioiantis and the sensible pacificator of the grum-
blers, Mr. COMINIUS CARR would appear to perfection. The
return of Sir HENRY "to his own again " is certain to mean
"many happy'returns.'" So let the shareholders cheer up.

THE German Reichstag discussed last
Wednesday a bill providing for the con-
struction of a railway from Dar-os-Salaam,
the capital of German East Africa, to
Mrogoro, a distance of 230'kilometres, at
a cost of £1,200,000. In opposition to the
bill it was stated that there were only
twelve Europeans in the region through
which the line would pass, the native in-
habitants numbering about 2j per square
mile, according to the translation by the
correspondent of the Times.
So the railway will cost about £100,000
for every one of the future first-class pas-
sengers. The expense has been carefully
arranged to fit iu with the number of
them. It seems as costly as our Uganda
Railway.
The gauge of the new line is to be
about 3 feet 0 inches. This seems also
arranged to suit the population. When
one of the twelve Europeans, doubtless all
Germans, residing on an average nineteen
kilometres from his neighbour, desires a
friendly chat, and a (.Has Bier, he will
travel over those eleven or twelve miles
in a first-class compartment about a yard
and a-half wide. If ho is an average
German he will fill that comfortably. The
same space in the third-class will exactly
accommodate the 2| natives who inhabit
each square mile. Could anything have
been calculated with greater mathe-
matical and military precision, even by a
German?
But, alas, even a German may overlook
something! If this colony, unlike other
German colonies, should become pros-
perous, the natives themselves might
grow fat. Then the population of a
square mile could no longer be squeezed
into one seat of a third-class car-
riage, and all the careful calculations
would be upset. The carriage itself
might be upset if the 2$ natives were
only fat enough.
Then, of course, the three - quarter
natives would have to go separately.
Would there be compartments labelled
"Fiir Rauchei-," and also "Fur }." The
enterprising Herr BAEDEKER is doubtless
already hard at work on his guide to
Mrogoro. When it is published we shall
be fully informed on all these matters,
and we shall learn what Trinkgeld should
be bestowed on three-quarters of a porter
—the native population seems at present
to consist of porters, so there ought to
be plenty at Mrogoro Station — and
whether three-quarters of a waiter would
be satisfied with three-quarters of a tip.
Also, if such persons will travel with
three-quarters of a ticket in the carriages
of the Mrogoroisclie Eisenbahngesellschaft.
But perhaps these three-quarter natives
are only the better halves of the men. H. D. B.
BEAUTIFUL FOR EVER;

ripe bloom of healthy youth can be indelibly fixed
upon the cheeks of all who desire it—in other
words, an American lady hag induced a AVert-Knd

graduated) into her countenance.]
THE flush no longer comes and goes
In fitful, irresponsive fashion,
The tint that emulates the rose
On maiden cheeks, the tinge that glows
With modesty, or joy, or passion.
It makes no difference nowadays
However you address a lady—
A "How-d'-yc-do?" or word of praise,
A Hooligan's familiar gaze,
Or clubman's anecdote that's shady.
The same invariable result
Attends your bold or shy advances
To greet the feminine adult
Who follows Fashion's beauty-cult
And thus her fading charm enhances.
How is it done? Ought one to tell?
It does seem just a shade ungallant
A pleasing mystery to dispel!
Still, should we let each florid belle
Wrap up hoi1 one cosmetic talent?
'Tis thus (at risk of being rude),
The reason of this lasting beauty:
•Your pink-and-whito complexioned prude
Has gone and had her face tattooed
Sub rosfi—-cutely, too, sub cute '.
And so anaemic skins suffuse
With permanently hectic flushes!
Stay, mortal fair ones, would you choose
These tell-tale and persistent hues
To linger in post-mortem blushes?

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THB DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 22nd.
—At first sight nothing in common be-
tween Lord MORRIS, First Baron KIL-
LANIN, and Ebenezer
partner of the firm
Marley. Yet both
strange experience,
will be remembered,
his first sleep on Christmas Eve, beheld
his former self, dead these thirty years.
Lord MORRIS, sitting to-night in Peers'
Gallery, looked down on young MORRIS,
elected for Galway thirty-six years ago,
making his maiden speech. The Peer in
the Gallery, with the wisp of white hair
encircling his cheerful countenance, has,
according to the almanacs, passed his
three score years and ten. Nevertheless,
he saw himself upstanding by the Bench
below the Gangway, in age not far
across the thirties, with all his life
before him.
Not many in present House who heard
the Boy from Galway make his maiden
speech in the Session of 1865. Here he
is again, black-haired, youthful in coun-
tenance, with flexible voice oiled with
touch of the brogue, unfailing fluency,
unabashed confidence, taking to life and
work in House of Commons as a duck
takes to water. MICHAEL MORRIS, Mem-
ber for Galway, 1865; MARTIN MORRIS,
Member for Galway, 1901. And think of
all that lies between the dates!
A rare, perhaps unique, experience for
the fond father in the Gallery, hearing
his own mellifluous voice raised again in
the House of Commons across the borders
of the century.
"Nunc Dimittis, TOBY, dear boy. Which
being translated means 'I go off to me
dinner.' Glad you like the boy's speech.
He is, as you say, hampered with diffi-
dence. I suffered from the complaint
meself when I was his age. Haven't
quite got over it yet; but I 'm always
willing to learn, ever striving to im-
prove."
Business done.—Debate on Irish Uni-
versity Education.
Tuesday.—Curious how trouble tells
upon some men. Just notf it is quite easy to
distinguish a coal-owner from a fishmonger
or other honest tradesman. If going about
the Lobby, seated in the Library, or pass-
ing through the dining-room, you see a
man whose clothes hang on his shrunken
limbs, whose eyes are dulled with weeping
in the dead, unhappy night, whose conver-
sation is a wail, whose every breath a sigh,
yon know he is a colliery proprietor. For
months he has been accumulating riches
beyond the dreams of avarice. Not a
grade of society, not a class of the trading
community that has not cast tribute into his
coffers. The common, or tenement, house-

SDRVH'ORS OF THE (GLAD-)STONE AGE!
"I belong to the ancient, prehistoric, pre-Adamite school of my friend Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice.

doctrine."—(See ff. Campbell-Bannerman't Speech at the Hotel Cecil.)
holder has paid famine prices for one of
the necessities of life through the* winter
months. The working man, the struggling
shopkeeper who buys his coal by the hun-
dredweight, has been fain to deal with
nubbly bits as if they were nuggets of gold.
Then comes the CHANCELLOR OP THE
EXCHEQUER with the abhorred shears, and
proposes to nip off a shilling per ton
profit.
Not quite that; exact proposal of
Budget is that the foreigner who takes
our priceless and irreplaceable coal shall
contribute a shilling a ton to the cost
of the war mainly responsible for sending
up prices to the range reached in the
winter, the colliery proprietor being so
good as to collect it on account of the
State. Hence these tears. It is not so
much for self and partners that the col-
liery proprietor weeps. "My country,
still of thee," he is thinking. The
foundations of the prosperity of the
Empire are deeply dug in coal. Put up
the export price by a shilling a ton and,
by some magical process, the foundation
is shattered and with it slips away the
crumbling fabric of the Empire.
"Dear boy," said the MEMBER FOR
SUCK, lending his arm to one of the
afflicted, on his way to his carriage
waiting in Palace Yard, "my heart bleeds
for you. It is said that, being in rather
a large way of business in the coal line,
you, personally, last year cleared an
exceptional profit of a million and a half
sterling. Why, you know, if you liked,
you might, all by yourself, go to war
with the Boers for a whole week, paying
cash down out of your profits. And now a
heartless, unsympathetic Chancellor of
the Exchequer wants you to collect a
shilling a ton for him on your exports!
Yes, yes, I know ; but it's no use blubber-
ing. Taking things all round, I wish I
had half your complaint."
Business done.—Income Tax resolution
carried in Committee of Ways and Means.
Thursday.—Mr. WEIR begins to think
life would be endurable only for other
people who share it. In the new Parlia-
ment he finds its conditions woefully
altered. In the last century he had un-
d isputed preeminence at the Question hour.
None but he thought of putting down
from six to ten Questions at a sitting.
Now not only is the thing common; the
number is far exceeded. All can grow the
flower now, for all have got the seed.
Came along to-night with bis six Ques-
tions, including one about Mark IV. bullets
he has put a score of times. Thought that
pretty well; and, behold, D. A. THOMAS
turned up with twenty Questions!
"Taffy was a Welshman," Mr. WEIR
hummed with unwonted asperity, "Taffy
was — an abstractor of other people's
ideas."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Observed with growing indignation that
the Member for Merthyr Tydvil had
improved upon another of his copyrights.
The original Note of Interrogation, as is
well known, prefaces each of his Ques-
tions with a bye-play which not even
monotony can rob of terror. It is most
effectively played off on tho LORD AD-
VOCATE. That personage, affecting in-
difference to Mr. WEIR'S criticisms 'on
divers matters, endeavours to make
jaunty replies; sometimes declines to
make any. Mr. "WEIR not to be trifled
with. When to-night he had occasion
to ask LORD ADVOCATE Question about a
bridge—why the water ran down beneath
its arches instead of running tip — he
solemnly rose, regarded the guilty Minis-
ter with chilling glance, slowly fixed his
pince-nez, looked at him again, and said
in profound bass notes, "Ques-ti-on 117.
The LORD ADVOCATE."
That is another of Mr. WEIR'S patents.
The ordinary Member, having the Ques-
tion to put, would say, " I beg to ask the
LORD ADVOCATE Question Number 117."
Mr. WEIR'S mood is too tragic for pre-
positions or personal pronouns. He in-
vests an ordinary Question with the
solemnity of sentence of death. If after
his ordinary formula he added, "And
may the Lord have mercy on your soul,"
no one, least of all the LORD ADVOCATE,
would be surprised.
Added anguish to-night to observe the
intruder's adaptation of his own dramatic
pauses. Having received answer to one
of his Questions, Mr. THOMAS sank into
condition of profound reverie. Wakened
by SPEAKER calling on him to put his next,
he started, deliberately studied the paper,
and having by leisurely process dis-
covered it, slowly recited the number.
When you have twenty Questions all in
a row, and the Budget waiting to come
on in Committee of Ways and Means,
this takes time. Mr. WEIR thought it
was decidedly low.
Business done.—Of a sitting of nine
hours, the fag end of four and a half
allotted to business.
Friday. — There is lamentation in
Speaker's Court, wailing by Westminster
Bridge. Billy is dead I Dead in his

When, nearly six years ago, Billy first
came to Westminster in the suite of the
newly-elected SPEAKER, ho was a shapely
dog, light-hearted, enterprising, always
ready to sample a fresh calf. Close ac-
quaintance with Parliamentary life had
effect of blunting his spirits, souring his
mind, and giving to his nose an upward,
scornful, turn unusual even in a bull-dog.
Muzzling order began process of deterio-

something of the size of a herring-net, he
grew visibly depressed in manner. Never
forgave himself for missing opportunity

June, 1898. Crossing Palace Yard on his
way to take an airing in tho park, Billy

Your maid? Oh, no, she. didn't—really. She was quite nice
to me. She was only doing what you—her duty. When I said
I was connected with the Press, she said you made it a rule
never to be interviewed, and just at first it was—it was a little
disappointing. It's a long way from—from where I live. But
I was just going, and then—and then when I saw you I couldn't
help calling to you, and you. were so kind, and I was tired, and
—and people aren't generally kind. And though I knew you
were—oh, from your photographs, and I've seen you act, of
course. That was what made me think of coming. I liked your
face. Besides, you would have made such splendid copy. And
I hadn't thought you would mind—really I hadn't. Most of
them don't, you know: they—they rather like it. But I ought
to have known you were different. I 'd no right to want to pry
into your life—oh, but I did.
Now, I really am better. No; no more, thanks. I 'm not used
to it. Besides I must be—ivhat f Tell you about my life? Qh,
no—no, I couldn't. It wouldn't interest you: it's not—not so
amusing as yours. No, I 'm sorry: I oughtn't to have said that,
I know, only—only it's so different, and sometimes it's terribly
hard not to be jealous of other people's happiness, when one
struggles and struggles—Do you really want me to? Well, I '11
—where shall I begin? Connected with the Press—that's me.
I don't know if it's a regular phrase, but it's what I call
myself. I wonder—I do wonder why I 'm talking to you like
this. I haven't talked—not really talked—to a human being for
ages. But you—you—oh, I can't help it. I must talk to you, if
I bore you to death. Ah, no, Mrs. ALLEYNE, I know. If you
were I shouldn't—I couldn't. But you are so different to the
rest,—so different.
Yes, I '11 go on. I was thinking. When I—I told your inaid
I came from a paper, that wasn't true. No, I 'm not on any
paper. There 'a no room for me. Yes, I 've tried—oh, how I 've
tried—sketches and little bits of verse,—oh, about everything
—anything that came into my head, only so few things would
come. And then the editor I knew resigned, and the new man
had his own people, of coarse, and my things came back. I 'm
not good enough; never was, I suppose, or else I 've lost the
knack.
May you? Of course, anything you like. Oh, that! Is
that all? Well, I'll tell you. To-day is the third—no
fourth. Three weeks ago to-day—Do you ever read Truth ?—
Well, throe weeks ago I won half a Truth puzzle—that was a
guinea. My rent—oh, a room in Soho—is two shillings a week,
und I wash my own things. No, it doesn't leave much, does
it? But you mustn't think things are always as bad. I haven't
had to buy clothes. I had plenty when I—before I came to
Soho. And I get little scraps into some of the papers, and
there 's a German waiter, who lives under me: I 'm teaching
him English, and he just pays the rent. Once I taught a strong
man from one of the music halls. He paid me well for a fort-
night—he was making twenty pounds a week, and then he—he
wanted me to go—go and live with him, and so that came to an
end.
What a dear face you have. I? Ah, but not like you. And
yet even I—it doesn't make life any easier, does it? Have you
found that too? No, life isn't easy. The contrasts are too big.
Do you ever go into the Park? It's a dreary, dreary place.
I go and watch them, carriage after carriage, face after face—
relations of mine, some of them. Oh, no. They know I 'm
connected with the Press, but they 're too busy to know me,
now. Squirrels in a gilded cage, somebody called them; and
it's true, you know. They can't get out. Sometimes the men
do: they get away, to climb or to fight. But the others, never.
And wherever they go they take their cage with them, and just
go round and round in it. And yet—how I envy her—I mean
them. No, I don't, I mean her.
Yes, you 're right. I may as well tell you. Oh, my dear, I
can't help telling you. There was a man—yes, I see him there
sometimes, and once—to-day he saw me. He asked me to marry
him—that was in the old days, before I was connected with the
Press. And I said Yes. Do you think I was very wrong? Ah,
but you don'-t know. I 've been punished. He was—he was
King Cophetiia, and I—my mistress—yes, I was a governess.
It's an old-fashioned sort of story, isn't it? When we told her—
she was his mother, you know, and a very great lady—she
packed me off at once without a character, as if I had stolen
the spoons. And after that—Soho.
Going on? But there's [nothing to go on about; that was
the end. You can't, go beyond a German cook-shop in Soho,
where the stairs reek of dirty cooking, and the bannisters are
all greasy with it, and yet you must catch hold of them to
drag yourself upstairs when you come back tired out. I can
keep my own room clean, but—oh, King Cophetna! No, of
course it wasn't quite the end, only the rest—must I tell you?
—it isn't quite so old-fashioned. He ought to have defied his
people, and stuck to me—they do in the story-books—only, he
didn't. And now they—they '11—no, he 's not married yet.
But to-day—I saw him on my way here, and he stopped and
asked me what I was doing, and he—he said he was going to
be married. He didn't tell me her name. Perhaps you—I
wonder if you know her. He looked so—so strong.
Why do you sit looking into the flre? Thinking? Oh, no,
don't think. Life's so full of thinking. When one wakes in
the night—oh, I daren't think of it. Talk tome. Tell me about
yourself. Are you happy? Are you—is there—shall you ever
marry again? I 'd like to think of you—oh, how glad I am 1
And is he—is he—but, of course, he isn't good enough for you.
Well—shall I ever see him? To-day? Is ho coming to-day?
No, don't ask me. Not to-day. Not even for you. And yet—
can you understand what seeing you act meant for me? I just
felt that I could—well, no, not die for you; that would be
nothing—but live for you, light your fires, scrub for you—
wliat? Do you really mean it? To come and live with you!
Your secretary! Rest me! Would it rest me? Would it!
Let mo hold your dear hand. Now, now I can tell you. I would
do anything—anything to serve you. Only, don't you see, I
can't come here? Yes, can't. It would be running away.
I must go on trying to—oh, I can't explain. If you had asked
me only a little ago—but now—now I 'm stronger. Don't you
see I must fight it out! Look at me, dear. Tell me—oh, no,
I 'm not brave—tell me it's stronger to say No. No, don't tell
me that. Tell me it would be weak and cowardly to say Yes.
Be strong for me. You don't know how you 've tempted me.
But if you will fight it with me—yes, yes. Better to fight it
out. No, not perhaps. Dear, how you understand. Yes, oh,
yes, I '11 come and see you, but now—now I can go back to it
all. Oh, how I—Listen! there's someone coming. Will it be
him? Are you—What! Is this—Why, it's—I—I—forgive mo for

someone else, someone who is dead. Mrs. ALLEYNE has just
been telling me about you. I 'd like to—Will you shake hands
with me, just to show there's no—no ill-will, after my rude-
ness? I congratulate you with all my—heart. Ah! No, no,
it's only my hand. It's not so—it's weaker than it used to
be, and you—you 're so strong. No, please, please don't think

TAXES TO PAY AND AXES TO GEIND.
To the Editor of the "Sentinel."
SIR,—I wish to enter an emphatic protest against the pro-
posals of Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH. At a time when the
middle classes of this country are rolling, if I may say so, in
penury and •when we have more than enough to do to make even
one end meet, to say nothing of both or more, the cold and
heartless suggestion that twopence should be added to the
Income-Tax is enough to make every honest Englishman's blood
boil. The Chancellor seems to think we are growing so bloated
with wealth that all we have to do is to live in the lap of luxury
with millions of pounds in our pockets and to smile, positively
to smile, when he asks us for an overwhelming share of the
burdens that he and his Government have put on our shoulders.
We Income-Tax payers are a patient race, but patient people
often have short tempers and long memories, as he will find to
his cost if this kind of thing goes on. I may be told that we
children to school. My margin of profit is so small that if any
further cost is imposed upon me I shall have to give up all my
subscriptions, put down my horses and live in a cottage, whilo
my workmen will receive no wages. Can this be what Sir
MICHAEL intended? If so, it is time that wo should combine
our voices and make ourselves heard amidst the deaf adders of
Downing Street. It is useless to sit still. We must be up and
doing. Let nobody tell me that I object to all taxation. That
is, to put it plainly, a lie. I have not a word to say against
the tax on Sugar. Indeed, twice the proposed duty might be
levied on that article. Some foolish people have talked about
the cost of the war as an excuse for the Coal duty. Can any-
thing be more absurd^ Every penny we have spent could be
at once recovered from the gold-mines—but the Government
are afraid of offending the gold people, though they don't mind
treading on the corns of the collieries. At the next election
my vote shall go to the Radical Candidate. Yours truly,

are at war, and that war costs money. Suppose I admit it—
what then? Nobody is more willing to do what is fair than we
are. What we protest against is the scandalous injustice of
the new impost on incomes. Of course we must flght the
Boers to a finish, and it is no doubt right that Coal and
Sugar should be taxed, but it is not right to perpetrate the
wickedness of putting a premium on idleness—for that is what
it comes to. The more money a man makes, the more he will
have to pay in income-tax. Every owner of an income will
therefore keep it down to its lowest point, in order to pay as
small a tax as possible, and the consequence will be not only
that the Chancellor's proposal will defeat itself but that
England's sun will set, and her commercial supremacy will go to
America or Germany. When a Conservative Candidate next
asks for my vote I shall say, "Never again."

vobisl Is the Government collectively insane? The idea that
Sugar should be taxed is enough to fill the mildest man with
gall. Are we living in a free country, or under the despotic
sway of a Russian autocrat? I ask these questions not for
myself alone, but for millions of others. To tax Coal is the
merest justice—but to put a tax on an article used by every
British breakfaster, an article that sweetens the cup of the
toiler and adds a charm to the champagne glass of the duchess
—that, Sir, is an outrage not to be borne. For what did we
win our liberties if, on the specious plea of a war in South
Africa, we are to be thrust back at once into a sugarless
servitude. If Britons are what they once were, there will bo a
wave of indignation that will strike like a flaming sword to the
heart of our craven and incompetent ministers. Let Sir
MICHAEL beware before it is too late. If tho basis of taxation
must be broadened, why not tax cats, bicycles, orchids, eye-
glasses, frock-coats, and Gainsborough hats?
Yours, Sir, indignantly, SACCHAROMETER. •
ON Sir MICHAEL'S successfully squaring Budget matters with
his ministerial confreres, the Government will probably be
remembered as "The Coal-ition Cabinet."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL
A PLEA FOR THE GUILTY.
I WAS formerly a great reader of
Romance. To this day I can remember
the kind of story that delighted my
youth. The beautiful heroine, a tender
blonde with luxuriant tresses that swept
the ground -when the author was good
enough to allow the French maid to loose
the restraining bands; the hero, so brave,
so handsome, and misguided withal; the
cold, crafty villain (with eyes that glit-
tered), who had a knack of
turning up in unexpected
places and upsetting every-
body's calculations. What
wonderful embodiments those
scoundrels were! It is for
such a guilty soul that this
plea is preferred. For one;
for whom? I remember the
type excellently well. How
the stealthy, silent-footed
rogue triumphed over his
virtuous companions. How he
plotted and threatened, bullied
and tortured, mocked and
insulted all who had the
audacity to be in the same
story with him. How he laid
traps for the heroine's father,
practising cruelly on that un-
suspecting gentleman's cre-
dulity. With what adroitness
he bribed the French maid,
with what a contempt he
viewed the hero, with what
admirable charm he ingratiated
himself with all who were to
become his miserable dupes.
But his cunning and suavity
availed him nothing in the
end. He would meet a scoun-
drel's doom. He could not
survive the story. How joy-
fully I witnessed his end. How
I screamed with delight when
this vile little cheat and mur-
it impossible to live through. I should
like to see him alive at the end of
"Nemesis," "The Sleuth Hounds of
Justice," "Retribution," "The Sword of
Damocles," or any such annihilating
portions of the romance. Desperate as
he is, quick, clever, artful, full of all
kinds of trick, subterfuge and resource
as he is shown to be, he cannot survive
the story. Justice and the reader will
be satisfied.
In course of timo this tremendous fact

smother the heroine, as the occasion and
plot demanded? I know not. I only
know I felt a tender sorrow at his sub-
jugation, a true compassion at his over-
throw. A heartfelt regret that he should
be so inevitably brought to book. Many
a time my expectation played the hypo-
crite, and made a semblance of believing
that it would find a villain •who outlived a
story. But such deception got no more
than it deserved. I have searched the
book-sellers in vain. Once I truly
believed I had found my im-
mortal knave. He was carry-
ing all before him. A
hundred pages saw him well
and hearty and full of devilry.
Page two hundred exhibited
him a Napoleon of crime. On
page three hundred and two
he was grinning sardonically
in the blanched faces of his
enemies. Page three hundred
and twenty began a chronicle
of his triumphant misdeeds.
At page three hundred and
forty-one he had perpetrated
the most successful murder of
modern times, and was in
possession of a comfortable
sum from an Insurance Com-
pany; all without the faintest
spark of suspicion being at-
tached to him. Another

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI
DRAMATIC SEQUELS.
XI.— THE LADY ON THE SEA.
WHEN IBSEN ended The Lady from the
Sea by making Mrs. WANGEL give up her
idea of eloping with "The Stranger"
and decide to remain with her husband
and her step-children, many people must
have felt that there was a want of finality
about the arrangement. Having discussed
so exhaustively with Dr. WANGBL the
advisability of leaving him, she could
hardly be expected to give up the project
permanently. The play is therefore one
which emphatically calls for a sequel.
SCENE I.—Beside the pond in the W ANGELS'
garden. It is a malarious evening in
September. HILDA and BOLETTA, Mrs.
WANGEL'S step-daughters, are, as usual,
failing to catch the carp which are said
to Haunt the pond.
Boletta. Do you think she (nodding
towards Mrs. WANGEL, who prowls to and
fro on the damp lawn with a shawl over her
head) is any better?
Hilda.-No, worse.
Boletta (cheerfully). Oh, she can't be
worse.
Hilda. That's all very well for you.
You 're going to be married. It doesn't
matter to you how mad she is! You '11 be
out of it before long.
Boletta (jubilantly). Yes, I shall be out
of it.
Hilda. But I shan't. (DarWu) However,
perhaps she '11 go away soon.
Holt-tin. Papa still thinks of moving to
the sea-side then?
Hilda (crossly). Oh, Papa—Papa never
thinks!
Boletta. Hush, HILDA. What dreadful
things you say!
Hilda (grimly). Not half so dreadful as
the things I should like to do.
Boletta. HILDA!
Hilda. Oh, yes, I should. And I will
when I grow up. I '11 make Master-builder
SOLNESS tumble off one of his own steeples.
Think of that now 1
Boletta. What a horrid child you are.
And just when I thought you were begin-
ning to get on better with her too!
(nodding towards Mrs. WANGEL). It's
most provoking.
Hilda. I call it perfectly thrilling, my-
self. But here she comes. (Mrs. WANGEL
approaches.) Go away. I want to talk to
her. (Exit BOLETTA doubtfully). How are
you to-day, Mother?
Mrs. Wangel (absently). Eh?
Hilda (controlling her impatience). I
asked how you were.
Alp*. Wangel. But you called me mother.
I 'm not your mother. I 'm only your step-
mother.
Hilda. But I can't address you as step-
mother. "People don't do those things,"

Hilda. Mother, have you seen him?
Mrs. Wangel. I believe WANGEL is in the
surgery.
Hilda. I don't mean Papa. What does
it matter where Papa is I I mean The
Stranger. The English steamer is at the
pier. It arrived last night. (Loofcs at
Mrs. WANGEL meaningly.)
Mrs. Wangel (vaguely). Is it, dear? You
astonish me.
Hilda. You will go and see him, of
course?
Mrs. Wangel. Oh, of course, of course.
Hilda. I think it must be so perfectly
thrilling to go down all by one's self to
a steamer to see a strange man who is
not one's husband.
Mrs. Wangel (recalling with difficulty
her old phrase). Oh, yes—yes. It allures
me wonderfully.
Hilda. I should go at once, if I were
you, before Papa comes out.
Mrs. Wangel. Don't you think I ought
to tell WANGEL? I have always been
accustomed to consult him before eloping
with anyone else.
Hilda. I think not. You roust go of
your own free will. You see, Papa might
urge you to go. And then it would not
be altogether your own will that sent
you, would it? It would be partly his.
Mrs. Wangel. So it would.
Hilda. Isn't it splendid to think of
your going away with him to-night,
quite, quite away, across the sea?
Mrs. Wangel (doubtfully). Yes.
Hilda. You know you always like the
sea. You talk so much about it. It
allures you, you know.
Mrs. Wangel. Yes, the idea of it is
wonderfully alluring. (With misgiving)
But I 've never been on the sea.
Hilda (enthusiastically). That's what
makes the idea so thrilling. It will be
quite a new sensation! The sea is so
fresh and buoyant, you know 1 So rough 1
Not like these vapid fiords where it's

full of the sea?

Ah, the sea, the -wonderful, changeful sea!

SCENE II.—The deck of the English steamer.
Tlie vessel has got outside the shelter
of the fiord, and is beginning to pitch
a little in the long sea rollers. Mrs.
WANGEL is discovered groping her ivay
cautiously up the companion in the
darkness.
Mrs. Wangel. This motion is very dis-
agreeable—(The vessel gives a very heavy
lurch)—most disagreeable I I wonder if I
could speak to The Stranger now? HILDA

Mrs. Wangel. No—er—that is, yes.

Steward. There's no one of that name

Mrs. Wangel (fretfully). Mr. JOHNSTON
isn't a passenger. Mr. JOHNSTON is the
second mate. (The vessel lurches again.)
Oh, oh!

But the second mate's name is BROWN.

Mrs. Wangel (as the boat gets further
out to sea and begins to roll heavily). This
is horrible. I begin to think I don't like
the sea at all. I feel positively ill. And

exhilarating. It doesn't exhilarate me in
the least. I wish JOHNSTON would come

he could find somewhere for me to lie

Brown (briskly). Not a bit. Never was
so sorry to see a -woman in my life.
Mrs. Wangel (in liorror). But you care
for me. You said you wanted me.
Brown. I know I did. Thought old
QUANGLE-WANGLE would buy me off if I
put the screw on. He didn't see it.
Stingy old cuss!
Mrs. Wangel (appalled fit this way of
speaking of her husband). But 'you never
asked Dr. WANGEL for anything?
Brown. No fear. Too old a hand for
that. He 'd have put me in prison for
trying to extort money.
Mrs. Wangel. How could you expect
him to give you money if you didn't ask
for it?
Brown. I didn't suppose he was an
absolute fool. When a man has a crazy
wife be can't be such a born natural
as to suppose that another man really
wants her to go away with him. He
wants the price of a drink. That's
what he wants. But old QlJANGLE-
WANGLE was too clever for me. He
wouldn't part.
Mrs. Wangel. Wouldn't part husband
and wife, you mean?
Brown. No, I don't, and you. know I
don't. Wouldn't part with the dibs;
that's what I mean.
Mrs. Wangel (as the vessel gives a big
roll). Oh, I 'in going to be very ill in-
deed. Why did I think I should like the
sea?
Brown. Why, indeed? I don't know.
Dash me if I do. Mad, I suppose.
Mrs. Wangel. What am I to do now?
Brown. Go back to old QUANGLE, if
he '11 take you. He's fool enough, I
dare say.
Mrs. Wangel. But I can't. We're out
at sea. I can't get back now. I think
I "m going to die. [She sinks upon a seat.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MAN FROM BLANKLEY'S;
On, THE MERRY WIVES OF WEST-BOURNE.
To faithful patrons of Mr. Punch there
is no need to recall the plot of The Man
from Blankley's. Apart frora the develop-
ment of a single scheme of mutual con-
fusion, cleverly contrived to extend over
the greater part of the play, it is a pure
comedy of dialogue. The wisdom of the
•wise critics, -with whom T would ask leave
to break a Free Lance edged with plati-
tude, has of late been instructing us in the
view that drama is primarily concerned
with action and not with speech. This
is, of course, to forget the fairly notice-
able fact that speech is one form of action;
and, indeed, of all forms, the most
common, the most continuous, the most
readily illustrative of character; and, for
all these reasons, the most conveniently
dramatic. Indeed, in the ordinary
relations of actual life (which the stage
hypocritically professes to reproduce)
people seldom do things; they talk.
Tragedy, perhaps, is more a matter of
action, though I have held speech with
people whose dulness made the terrors of
death seem a light thing. But in the
Comedy of Life, for one humorous thing
that I have seen done, I have heard a
thousand said.
This is not to imply that all comedies of
dialogue are suited to the stage. The
detached scintillation, the epigram of
which just any irresponsible person is
made the arbitrary mouthpiece—these
rather lose than gain by recital on a stage.
But dialogue that defines the characters
of which it is the inevitable expression
may gain much by realization, through
eye and ear, of individuality and environ-
ment. And this is just the kind of
dialogue which runs through Mr. ANSTKY'S
play. From the first speech that intro-
duces us to each new arrival there is no
least word spoken that is not subtly
germane to the character that utters it.
And in these " Voices " of middle Middle-
classdom, the author shows himself too
good an artist to spoil the actuality of
his dialogue by straining on the one hand
after epigram, or falling on the other into
farce. If pure fatuity is natural to any
of his characters, they are allowed to
talk it. But in every remark, even the
most apparently pointless, he has, if you
consider it, discriminated nicely between
the fatuities of which his fatuous people
are severally capable. And all the details
of dress, of make-up, of pose, of entourage,
combine to justify the dramatic present-
ment of these characters by affording a
clearer realisation of their idiosyncrasies.
But plays that depend upon the finest
dialogue are liable, as plays, to the
defects of their quality. It was scarcely
to be hoped that the enthusiastic appre-
ciation which the First Act received would

be kept up through the Second without the
sustainment of a fresh incident. Add to
this the greatly daring experiment of a
set dinner-party lasting from rise to fall
of the curtain. Though the difficulties of
the mitte-en-scene were admirably over-
come, and hosts and guests (nobly as-
sisted by Mr. ARTHUR PJ.AYFAIU as the
butler) played their parts almost as well
as they could be played, the attempt on
the first night seemed to fail of a per-
fect justification. In part, this was due
to comparison with the First Act, with
its novel introduction of characters who
were bound to lose something of their
pristine bloom; in part to the almost total
absence of the relief of movement among
the principal characters, and in part to
the necessary straining of stage conven-
tion by loud conversation a deux, not
always meant for the general ear. It is
characteristic of Mr. ANSTEY that ho
refused to evade this last difficulty
by making his conversation gensral, and
so defying the sacred laws of over-peopled
dinner-tables.
Since the first night the dialogue his
been curtailed, and the scene is played
more closely; and if Mr. FORD would only
keep still in his seat, and not wriggle hia
body round to face his neighbour, it would
be difficult to find a flaw either in tho
acting or the stage-management.
In a strict dramatic sense the Third
Act is the best. It contains the only
deliberately planned "situation," whore
Mr. Qabriel Oihucittle proudly enters the
drawing-room on the arm of Lord .S'trat/i-
peffer with the pronounced intention of
introducing him to his wife, and this at
the moment when that buxom dauia is

that he is a man from Blankley's shop.
This is irony of tho most Greek. Here,
too, in the study of vulgarity, is a
happily conceived contrast between the
changing attitudes of the company,
shocked in turn by the loss of their
illusion and then of their disillusion.
In the construction of his play, the
author has gone one better than the
Unities. By the device of letting the
ladies' conversation in the drawing-room
overlap that of the men downstairs, he
gains a fair number of minutes over the
common enemy, almost enough to make
good the intervals and allow the play to
coincide exactly with the period which it
designs to cover.
Before the final curtain I think, with
deference, that Mr. ANSTEY might have
set a sterner limit on his love-scene: but
he was excusably tempted to draw out
the linked sweetness of his one passage
of sentiment; and the gallery in these
cases always demands clear proof that the
lady's future is assured. And then Mr.
ANSTEY has a secret passion, too little
gratified, for being taken seriously.
Mr. HAWTREY, though at heart probably
suffering fron the same yearning, may
have been embarrassed on the first night by
the comparative respectability of his part.
Yet he acted with well-bred assurance in
a situation that might have shattered the
self-confidence of an ordinary lord. But,
except when he bursts into uncontrollable
and most infectious laughter over his mis-
taken identity, he is perhaps a shade too
statuesque. In the absence of Mr.
ARTHUR WILLIAMS, through sudden indis-
position, Mr. FORD (not Ford of the other
"Merry Wives "), taking the part of Mon-
tague TiiitiiHi-xli at short notice, earned the
gratitude of the house by his rendering of
the apologetic husband moving uneasily in
the too flue air of the liaut monde of West-
bourne Park. On a second view, I found
him not quite within the picture. While
the others without effort are all living
characters, he tries to be too life-like, and
only succeeds in giving himself the elastic
airs of a marionette.
Miss FANNY BROUOH, as his far, far
better half, more than justified the warmth
of her welcome. In her extremely varied
relations with the other characters she
showed an extraordinary intelligence and
versatility, and kept up her end of the
table, under the most trying circum-
stances, with a resourcefulness that was
quite masterly. Mr. AUBREY FITZGERALD,
as Mr. Poffley of the jeunesse doree of
Bayswater, raconteur and Tit-Bit statis-
tician, was irresistibly absurd; and the
complacent turkey-gobble with which he
disguised any hiatus in his gifted conver-
sation, was a continual joy. Miss JESSIE
BATEMAN as the Governess — her fresh
beauty and Paris gown both charming
contrasts to her incongruous surroundings
—played with nice feeling and restraint
in a kind of part that is seldom played so
well; reserving for the happy termination
of her love-scene a convincing ardour
of the sort that leaves a nice large
smudge of pearl-powder on the lapel of
the gentleman's coat. All the minor
characters, without exception, are admir-
ably played; but the palm must still
be given — ungrudgingly, I am sure,
by her elders—to the altogether fascinat-
ing performance of little Miss BEATRICE
TERRY.
As a rule, the introduction of children
on the stage, employed generally ad
misericordiam, has the effect of freezing
at their source the welling founts of pity
in my breast. But this child was only
asked to be human and adorable. Always
a refreshing picture, with the lovely
auburn hair against the pretty white
frock, she played the part of a natural,
outspoken child with no more hesitation
than was proper to her character, and
without the lightest shadow of preco-
city. Whether in her piquant.criticism
of the pompous Uncle Gabriel (Mr. HENRY
EEMBLE at his happiest), or in the easy
confidence which she shows in the
stranger gentleman from Blankley's (see
how she takes him her picture-book at
once, with that instinct for the right
man which is the gift of children and
the wiser quadrupeds), she had the hearts
of all the house at her feet.
I have spoken of the charm of the play
and its performance, I hope without
seeming to hold a brief for Mr. ANSTEY.
I am glad to think that its success does
not lie wholly on the knees of the gods,
for I doubt if the true delicacy of its
flavour always penetrates so near the
ceiling. But there should be enough of
the finer sense of humour among London
playgoers to fulfil the present healthy
promise of a pretty run.
Finally, I shall ask Mr. ANSTEY'S forgive-
ness for writing so ponderously on so
light a theme. Whatever poor badinage
one may contrive to command must be
reserved for the more serious creations of
the modern stage. O. 8.

A home in the rolling deep,
That the billows never lave
Though the currents never sleep.
Where the whiting come and tap
On the porthole's misty pane
And the congers bark and snap
In a dog-fishlike refrain.
A life 'mid the flowing tide,
A home in the sunless sea
In a ship with a porpoise hide
That ever concealed must be.
A perpetual game of nap
On the ocean's ill-made bed;
There one's feet get soft as pap
Where the sole alone may tread.

As he curses his garb of grime!

With the heat in a torrid clime!

ODE BOOKING-OFFICE.
FOR basis of his story By Command of the Prince (FlSHER
UNWIN) Mr. LAWRENCE LAMBE has taken a tragedy which, some
four years ago, held the attention, of Europe. It was the
cowardly murder of a hapless Austrian singing girl who pes-
tered her betrayer, aide-de-camp and favourite of the Prince
of Bulgaria. What made the affair more dramatic was that he
found an accomplice in the Prefect of Phil ippopolis, acting, as he
was informed by the principal scoundrel, under secret instruc-
tions from the Sovereign. That in such circumstances this
estimable functionary should have helped to waylay a hapless
girl, see her strangled and flung into a deep pool, throws a
lurid light on life in Bulgaria. Mr. LAMBE is not endowed with
the gifts of lucidity and compression out of which lights illum-
ing a story flash. He is, indeed, content doggedly to follow the
story as it was told in the newspapers of the day, literally trans-
lating the proceedings in the Criminal Courts. But he has visited
the scene of the tragedy, talked with some of the people who
had knowledge of the murderers and their victim, and supplies
many realistic touches from life. It is the classic story of AMY
ROBSART over again. Only, my Baronite finds truth is, verily,
stranger than fiction.
Mr. WM. LE QUEUX with his story of The Gamblers (HUTCHIN-
SON & Co.), rivets his readers' attention on a certain sensational
incident that occurs at the very outset of the story, and then
leading them on "per varies castis per tot discrimina (et
crtmino) rerum," compels them to inquire when on earth is
the explanation to be forthcoming, or rather, as the will-o'-the-
wisp-like author is perpetually taking us away from the straight
path and leading us through tortuous bye-ways of quite un-
expected and unsatisfactory surprises, the question to be asked
is, "When are all the requisite explanations to take place?"
Or, after the fashion of that Master of Detection-of-Crime
Romances, GABORIAU, the probable inspirer of Sherlock Holmes,
will the explanations have a separate volume all to themselves?
The story of The Gamblers is thoroughly interesting until the
last scene of all, in which the mysteries are intended to be
solred, but at this point the betting is that the reader who has
been most closely studying the intricacies of the story will find
himself more mystified than ever. To many with leisure and a
flair for such occupation, the elucidation of an apparently hope-
lessly muddled mystery is of itself an attraction, and these
literary detectives will retrace their steps, pick up at different
points the various threads, will gradually disentangle them,
and find that all the clues lead up to one and the same ildnoue-
ment. The Baron not having at his disposal leisure for such
engrossing work, must content himself with having passed a
fairly agreeable time in company with The Gamblerx, whom he
quitted without reluctance, not very much caring who won or
lost, yet decidedly in a mood to recommend the otherwise
unemployed among his friends to try their heads on this
"wonderful puzzle fifteen."
My Baronite is not familiar with the name of HESTER WHITE,
nor is there in her book, just published by BlACKWOOD, record
of earlier efforts. If, as therefore seems probable, Mountains
of Necessity is a first novel, it is a remarkable achievement.
To begin with, HESTER has hit upon a now situation, rare recom-
mendation in these days when of the making of novels there is
no end. It will be seen at a glance, when you are once shown
which way to look, what possibilities for skilful hands lie in
the entanglement of an avowed woman-hater who, anticipating;
instant death, marries a high-spirited girl, who consents be-
cause she wants his money for the salvation of her only
brother. Tho man recovers. The strangely-wed couple, un
suspecting the growing love that finally masters each, lon;.-
live apart. How they are brought together is n story eleverlv
planned and brightly told, its episodes affording opportunity
for display of intimate knowledge of life in India.
To the kind thoughtful ness, of a friend who knows a queer
book or "an odd volume" when he sees one, the Baron is
indebted for a copy of LAURENCE OLIPHANT'S Piccadilly
published by BLACKWOOD thirty years ago. In its literary
style there is a curious smack of two such very opposite
thinkers and writers as were BULWER and THACKERAY. Though
the novel is almost plotless, it is impossible not to feel that
its characters were drawn from types easily recognised at the
time, and it seems probable that the eccentric hero was in-
tended as a portrait-sketch of the author himself. This is
merely conjecture on the part of the Baron, to whom LAURENCK
OLIPHANT was no more than a name frequently mentioned in
the presence of this deponent, then only a merry Swish'd
schoolboy, now a " noble and approved good master."
The Baron has just come across an unpretending volume, a
kind of off-hand publication in a paper cover, as though indi-
cating that modesty could not possibly aspire to stout leather
durable binding, entitled Vagrom Verse and Ragged Rhyme, by
ROBERT GEORGE LEGOE (MILES & Co., LTD.). Its motto, wittily
applied, is "You shall comprehend all vagrom men," and,
therefore, whoever looks into it need not be afraid of getting u
headache from any recondite Browningisms. The dedication i-:i
"To any man." Here the light-hearted poet has lost a chance.
Surely it should have been "To any other man," and thus the
dedication would have been passed on from any one to any
other, and nobody would be so vain as to accept it as of persons I
and private application. However, this is "dropping into1'
metaphysics, and'' that way madness lies." His " Gypsy Song ''
should inspire a composer, and his "Baby " should be a delight
to mothers. You may pick out here and there one, for thin
book is to the reader as is the flower to the butterfly, that is,
if the reader be of that touch-and-go, flitting temperament.
"Anyhow, delighted to give this notice by way of a ' Leggc-
up,' " says the gay BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
CUPIDONS AND CUISINE.
QUITE an artistically correct picture-card of invitation to
visit Chef ODDENINO'S new place was sent out by that eminent
restaurateur, drawn by DUDLEY HARDY, and representing, with
Dudley-hardihood, several Cupidons, guiltless of any tailor-
made clothes, flying about anyhow, while one of them is blowing
them up with a trumpet. Perhaps this is symbolical of
M. ODDENINO'S own trumpet, which the innate modesty of the
true artist prevents him from performing on himself. Or, stay,
is it to signify that this trumpeting Cupidon in particular is
having a good " blow-out," and informing his other little one-
winged brethren of the fact? Anyway, this is a trump card for
;he artist of the free pencil and the artist of the frying-pan. But
why has each Cupidon got only one wing? Is it the moulting
season with them? Or is it again symbolical, to show that
another wing has yet to be added to the establishment?
ODDENINO is not an easy name to pronounce, some calling it
'Out-an-in-o " ; but if the entertainment provided be only " out-
an-out-o," what does this mispronunciation matter? Others
say " Odd-an-even-o," as though it were going to be quite a
'toss-up" how dinners and diners would be served by the
cuisinier, who has taken a step upwards and promoted himself
'rom the Royal to the Imperial. Would not an "Imperial
Crown Dinner" draw?" Anyway, if such an announcement
would draw as well as DUDLEY HARDY, the success of the enter-
is assured d'nuance.

THE FORCE OF HABIT.
[" I am'informed by 1ho»e who have been lawyers
in large practice, that there is so close an associa-
tion between work in Court and the reception of a
fee for that work, that it produces quite an un-
natural and unpleasant sensation to have to do the
work and not get the fee. So great is the force of
habit, that I can well imagine this might be the
cue."—Mr. A. J. Balfour.}
PRAY, do not think we men of law
Desire our fees too dearly;
Tis not for that we like to draw
Our twenty thousand yearly;
'Tis not that, wo arc fond of gold,
Or greedily would grab it
To hoard it, up in sums untold—
'Tis simply force of habit.
When we appear in Court, we know
A fee is bound to follow
As surely as the April snow
Succeeds the April swallow.
So often is the same thing done,
One gradually places
The fees as feature number one
In all ones's legal cases.
One gets to love them in one's heart,
To feel with satisfaction
That they are an essential part
And parcel of an action;
And if, by any strange mishap,
One chances to have missed 'em,
The sense of void upsets a chap
And tries his nervous system.
As money merely, they, of course,
Possess no fascination,
But who is proof against the force
Of such association?
'Tis not that wo are fond of gold,
Or greedily would grab it
To hoard it up in sums untold—
'Tis simply force of habit.
THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL CO.;
or, Sport (?) on a Business Footing.
REPORT OK THE DIRECTORS.
Presented at the Fifth Animal General
Meeting, held at the Company's Head
Office, May 1st, 1900.
IN reporting upon the affairs of the
Company for tho year ending April 20,
1906, the first duty of the Directors is to
refer to the great loss it has sustained
by the lamented death of its Chairman,
Sir BILL BLOGGS, Bart., M.P., for Leather-
head, and Minister for the Department
of Imperial Footerculture. His all-round
qualifications as ex-pugilist and chucker-
ont, as trainer and entrepreneur of the
Zulu Football Impi, as Promoter of
the Boxer Importation Syndicate, and
Manager of the Umpires Burial Society,
have contributed very largely to the
financial success of the Company.
Tho Board have elected tho Honble.
POTT HUNTER, the well-known President
of the Oldham Win Tie or Wrangle Club,
to bo Chairman in place of tho late Sir
BILL BLOGGS.

SISTERLY SYMPATHY.
Gwendolen. "How LATE YOU AKE, DEAR. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL THE
AF'lERNOON?"
Maude. "HELPING THE GRICJSBYS AT THEIR 'AT HOME,' AND MAKING MYSELF GENERALLY
FASCINATING AND AGREEABLE 1"
Gwendolen. "POOR THING I" WHAT A HAKD DAY'S WORK FOR YOU!"
The operations of the Company have been
greatly extended during the past twelve
months. This gratifying result has been
chiefly brought about by the sweeping
success of Association and Rugby candi-
dates at the recent General Election, none
but professionals standing a chance at the
polls. Tho inspectors of the Company
have thus been authorised by Government
to enforce tho New House-to-House collec-
tion of fines for non-attendance at League
Matches; and anti-football voters have
now been disfranchised.
Owing to salutary police-regulations the
gate-money at the company's fixtures has
touched a record, and we have again
to express our thanks to the various Rail-
way Companies for stopping all traffic on
Wednesdays and Saturdays throughout
the season, to permit the passage of the
thousands of football trains. Tho assist-
ance repeatedly rendered by the Household
Troops has also been most valuable in
guarding the referees, under a hundred
of whom this year, it has been ascertained,
have laid down their lives in the service
of the public.
The Crystal Palace arena being found
inadequate, it is proposed to convert the
whole of Hyde Park into a huge open-air
amphitheatre, which, it is estimated,
will hold between two and three million
spectators. The financial recommenda-
tions of this scheme are obvious. A
large percentage of the turnover will be
devoted to the development, snstenta-
tion and pensioning of the class of picked
professional performers, the British as
a nation having ceased to play tho game.
It may be mentioned incidentally that the
last amateur has just died in tho work-
house.
In conclusion, it is considered unneces-
sary that any detailed balance - sheet
should be issued, but it may be stated
in general terms that the Company's
revenue has this year run into eight
figures, and that the holders of Preference
Stock will receive a dividend of eighty
per cent.

To let the flying minutes go, nor heed them as they pass;
An easy book for company, and, though the dons may fret,
To puff, while porters prowl afar, tho lawless cigarette.
To hear the voice of friends who pass, and hail you as they go—
"Got up, get up, you lazy loon! It's time to come and row."
Oh, early, unforgotten friends, I cannot praise—can you?—

The silent, dogged earnestness of all the panting orew,
The strong beginning swiftly gripped, the finish driven through,
The rattle of the oars and, ah, sometimes the sound sublime
Of one who cheered, " Swing out, my lads, you're doing record

How fresh and cool the evenings were—like those who spent
them then
In frank and boyish cheerfulness, our self-created men.
Ah, would that I were back with those who keep in Cambridge

The old tradition ever young of life in cap and gown!
But we must walk in Fleet Street now, or perch upon a 'bus;
No avenue of rustling trees makes melody for us—
Yet memories of grassy slopes and sunny hours relax
The minds of men in London pent who never see the Backs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACT-ID FROM THK DlARY OF TOBT, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April 29.—
"Mr. LOWTHER, Sir, I would like to know
whether this Assembly is the most orderly
in the world ?''
'Twas the voice of Mr. FLAVIN. I knew
he 'd complain. A man of large mind,
kind nature, far-reaching sympathies,
there is one thing he can't stand; it is,
the mere approach to disorder. Observe
the punctilious style of his address. None
of your jumping up and chucking a
Question at the CHAIRMAN, as if it were
half a brick and he a stranger. "Mr.
LOWTHER, Sir."
The Question, it must be said, answered
itself. Mr. CHANNING was on his legs,
and, unfortunately, tho House doesn't like
Mr. CHANNINO. An honest, well-meaning
man, ever impelled by sense of duty, he
has thegift, quite unconsciously exercised,
of instantly arousing the antipathy of his
audience. This due largely to monotony
of their mutual relations. Mr. CHANNINO
is always in a minority, and the majority
are ever in the wrong. In ordinary cir-
cumstances, even when ho simply rises to
put a Question, the House howls at him.
To-night he delivered his views on the
war in South Africa, insisting that his
own countrymen, whether in civil or
military capacity, are criminally in the
wrong, whilst the gentle Boer, harmless
as an infant, is a martyr to brutal force
and murderous cupidity. Small wonder if
men, some of whom had lost dear ones

lliealius Flavinius Valerius, Senator.
"1 would like to know whether this Assembly is
the most orderly in the world."
killed in ambush or shot from under the
protection of tho white flag, indicated
dissent.
In brief, what was happening was a
shouting match. Gentlemen opposite
maintained perpetual roar. Mr. CHANSIXO
waited till something approaching lull
was reached, when he, yelling at top of
his voice, tried to work in the fragment
of a sentence.
Mr. FLAVIN, not wholly unused to scenes
of disorder, cherishes memories of a
night not long past when on the floor of
the House of Commons he played the
part of VALERIUS at the Battle of Lake
Rcgillus.
But fiercer grew Ihe fighting
Around VALERIUS dead;
For TiTi's dragged him by the foot,
And Ari.fs by the head.
The difference between the Roman
soldier and the Member for North Kerry
happily is that Mr. FLAVIN was alive,
was, indeed, kicking. But there were
TITUS and AULUS, disguised in uniform
of the Metropolitan police. MACAULAY,
in the spirit of prophecy that belongs
to the poet, accurately described their
method of handling the hon. Member
when conducting him towards the door.
Some people of fastidious taste might
describe this as a disorderly scene. Put-
ting it that way only establishes Mr.
FLAVIN'S position as an authority on the
subject. The Chairman of Ways and
Means shrank from reply. But Members
hung their heads and felt that, as usual,
Mr. FLAVIN had touched the spot. It
would have been idle at that particular
moment to affirm that "this Assembly is
the most orderly in the world."
Business done.—Tackling the Budget in
Committee.
Tuesday.—Little did MARK LOCKWOOD,
Colonel, rising early and pinning his
carnation in his buttonhole, guess what
to-day had in store for him. As for his
colleague on the North Western Board,
things have, with the new century, taken
a turn that prepares a heroic spirit for
any fresh disaster. Exiled from the
Treasury Bench, accused of confederation
with POWELL WILLIAMS in engineering a
corner in cordite, abashed by Cap'cn
TOMMY BOWLES'S pre-eminence in the mat-
ter of ducks, the Right Hon. ELLISON
MACARTXKY is a Blighted Being. To be
accused of wrongfully voting, to be
compelled to withdraw whilst House
discussed whether his vote should be
disallowed, were mere incidents in the
colour of the day.
For MARK LOCKWOOD the case was dif-
ferent. On him the sun always shines,
pleased to meet his friendly regard. He
is (in some respects) like the sunflower,
which "turns on her god when he
sets, the same look which she turned
when ho rose." Came down to-day
resolved to back up tin best of all

'* Like the Sunflower."
(Colonel M-rk I.-ckw-d.)
Governments in matter of tho Coal Tax.
By way of preface to business there was
a little Bill promoted by tho London and
North - Western Railway, whose direc-
torate he adorns. Rejection of Bill
moved. The Colonel naturally went into
Lobby in support of it. When he came
out was suddenly seized by Irish Mem-
bers with intent to make awful example
of him in conjunction with MACARTNEY.
Motion formally made to disallow his
vote.
On many a crimsoned battle-field the
Colonel, at the head of his faithful
Coldstrearos, has faced death. At
Chillianwallah, Albuera, Aliwal, and
Aldershot the light of battle has played
around the inseparable carnation. As
HOOD wrote of him in contemporary
history, he almost "left his legs in
Badajos's breaches." Those moments
of peril fade in comparison with what
he endured this afternoon, when, in
faltering voice, he repelled tho accusa-
tion brought against him by tho Irish
Members. Having made an end of speak-
ing, he saluted the SPKAKKR and, pulling
himself together, strode forth with mar-
tial step, whilst in his absence his sad
case was considered.
Honourably acquitted, but tho scars
remain. Shows afresh how uncertain is
life, how a day ushered in by a fair morn
may fizzle out under sulphureous cloud.
Business done.—None. House met for
morning sitting to discuss Coal Resolution

A SAD AND DESERVING CASE!!

of Budget. "No, you don't," said pro-
moters of private Railway Bill. Took the
floor, and kept it for whole of sitting.
Budget and colossal interests involved
set aside. This in accordance with
Standing Orders of biggest business esta-
blishment in the world. "Vous I'avez
voulii, George Dandin!"
Thursday.—JoiCEY, who has his OVID
at his finger ends, meant to-night to
garnish his speech on the Coal Tax with
a quotation from one of the Fables. It
is the lines beginning " Plenty has made me
poor "which, by the way, SPENSER
and DRYDKN, consciously or unconsciously
later "conveyed." But St. MICHAEL'S
speech in reply to SQUIRE OP MALWOOD
knocked OVID, and much else, out of his
head. Long time since there has been such
clattering down of card-built structure.
The SQUIRE not himself in the Coal Trade,
any more than BOBBY SPENCER is an agri-
cultural labourer. He is not a colliery, but
he lives near several when he visits his
constituency in Monmouthshire. To-night
put in best possible way the case of the
impoverished coalowner. JOICEY and
DAVID THOMAS wept silent tears as, in
eloquent passage, he described their fallen
fortunes ; literally cut off with a shilling.
Then came St. MICHAEL, accompanied
by All Angels in the way of facts and
statistics, showing that the British Coal
Trade, in Hpito of increased prices that
last year put an extra thirty-four millions
sterling in the coalowner's sack, main-
tains tho predominant position to which
during the last seven years it has ad-
vanced by leaps and bounds. Whilst
these figures were worked out, the
emaciated coal-owners bounded on the
Benches like parched peas over a fire of
Welsh coal. They pleaded for pity and
commiseration. And hero was the
CHANCELLOR OK TUB EXCHEQUER pelting
them with their own hand-picked coal,
for which of late they were getting 3U. a
ton, short-weight, delivered in your cellar.
Business done.—The bitter cry of the
coal-owner mocked by relentless CHAN-
CELLOR OK THE EXCHEQUER.
Friday.—BURT's speech on Coal Tax
much talked of. First time he has been
heard, even by some Members who sat in
last Parliament. All delighted with his
shrewd observation, strong common-sense,
logical force and under-current of quiet
humour, the amalgam made musical by
strange Northumbrian speech. SARK
regards the Member for Morpeth as one
of the finest episodes in Parliamentary
life. Himself an honour to tho House of
Commons, the House is at its very best in
its attitude towards him. The Ex-Secretary
of the Board of Trade, as with modest
pride he testifies, "commenced working
in coal-pita at an early age." As was
seen last night, when a crowded audience
followed with eager attention his un-
adorned eloquence, there is none it more
delights to honour.
"Inevitable talk in these sad times of
deterioration of Parliament," says the
MEMBER FOR SARK. "But when, as in
this case, tho House of Commons comes in
contact with absolute simplicity of man-
ner, genuine honesty of character, it
strikes true as steel. Now, as of old,
Trojan or Tyrian, duke's son or ex-collier,
are the same to it if only they be true
men."
Business done.—After brief interval,
Irish Members again in possession.
POPULAR REGULATIONS FOR THE
INFANTRY.

vice at the front on account of their youth."—

ODE TO THE "FLUE."
(Written in Bed therewith, with an apology
to the shade o} Lord Byron.)
THE flues increase! the flues increase!
Their endless fevers chill and burn—
Of sneezing born they seldom cease,
And leave us only to return.
Eternal change all hope denies,
Suns could not set which would not rise.
The Doctor looked iipon my bed,
My weary bed held on to me,
That Doctor gravely watching said,
"Thou canst not stand ! get up and see."
When tottering legs beneath me fell,
I knew I was indeed unwell!
Oh, how it rose and whence it came,
The dread bacillus of the flue,
And that mean germ which'puts to shame
All that the wisest ever knew,
Why all invincible are they,
It's not in Human Wit to say.
I stagger like a sea-sick man,
And reel across the swaying floor;
Or after doing all I can,
Find that I can do nothing more,
Then feebly murmur that it's clear
It must be arsenic in my beer.
I sicken at the sight of meat;
I turn from generous wines away;
What can a fellow drink or eat
When once the flue has come to stay?
Hardest in this the sufferer's lot,
Digestion is a thing forgot.
Oh, how am IV And what art thou,
My country ? Still through chills and rain
Thine elements keep up their row,
Thy peerless climate doth remain,
Till exercise my soul abhors,
And only wants to stop indoors.
Place me on any sort of steep,
Where nothing save some kind of air
May calm my flue-racked nerves to sleep,
And let ine settle anywhere;
In British damp perforce I stew—
Drat the Bacillus of the Flue! H. C. M.

CULTURED CONVEESATIONS.
I.—LITER AH Y.
SCENE—A serious-looking boudoir in South Kensington. Dis-
covered, Mrs. ONSLOW and Captain DORMER. Slie is a pretty
young widow wlwse knowledge, /recently referred to in con-
versation, of the fact tliat Mrs. BROWNING was the wife of Mr.
BROWNING, and that Lord BYHON was not all that lie should
have been, to say the least of it, lias won for her a reputation
for Intellect and Literary Culture to which her visitor is
endeavouring to live up by craftily adjusting his mental
equipment to her supposed requirements. On a table near her
are "all the latest publications," while her unconscious desire
to prove that her vast knowledge has not injured the Femi-
nine side of her clutracter is shown by her being engaged on
some ratlier feeble embroidery.
Captain Dormer (looking at her admiringly). You seem to me
to read everything, Mrs. ONSLOW I It's really wonderful! I'm
keen enough on reading, myself, but I don't seem to get the
time. Of course, I don't say I'm clever, and all that. But I
Icnow what I like, and I never let myself get rusty, even out
in India. Always kept up with the times, don't you know.
Now, there's this (He takes up a dainty white volume, tied
with green ribbons). J suppose you know who wrote it? I bet
you 're behind the scenes!
Mrs. Onslmo (flattered). "Well, I have heard—but you won't
repeat it, will you, Captain DORMER?—that it's by LAURENCE
HOUSMAN, or by Mrs. MEYNELL I
Captain Dormer (supposing he ought to be surprised). By
Jove 1 Fancy! LAURENCE HOUSMAN, you know I Or Mrs.
Whatshername! I Well 1
Mrs. Onsloiv. But, please, don't tell anyone, will you? It's
rather a secret, you see. Promise! I might get into such
trouble over it!
Captain Dormer. I promise. But who 'd have thought it?
Do you like the book, Mrs. ONSLOW? I thought it rather jolly,
in parts.
J! AS. Onsloiv. Oh! . . . I hardly think I should call it' that,
Captain DORMER.
Captain Dormer. Well, perhaps it is rather rot, as you say,
Mrs. ONSLOW.
Mrs. Onslow. I don't think I said that, did I?
Captain Dormer (changing the subject). Now, look here, Mrs
ONSLOW, you 're an intellectual woman. Who should you say
was the best modern writer—the best of all, you know?
Mrs. Onslow. Do you mean of the last decade, of the lasi
season, or of the entire Victorian era, Captain DORMER?
Captain Dormer (depressed and bewildered). Oh 1 I don'i
know. The last fifty years or so.
Mrs. Onslow (thoughtfully). Well, I suppose, of the grea
thinkers, SPENCER would be among the first.
Captain Dormer (cheerfully, recognising tlie name). Oh
Capital! Do you know, I thought you 'd say that, Mrs. ONSLOW
SPENSEU—the chap who wrote the Faery Queen—and a vorj
pretty thing I've heard, though I 've not had time to read i
myself. Si'UXSEK! Yes, by Jove. And where do you plnc<
CARLYLE and KIDKII HAGGARD and those Johnnies, eh? A goo<
way after SPENSER, I 'II bet!
Mrs. Onsloio (rather reproachfully). Oh, they're all s
different, Captain DORMER.
Captain Dormer. Yes, I suppose they are .... Poetry
now. You might not think so, but I 'm awfully keen o
poetry. I used to recite " The boy stood on the burning deck,'
when I was a little chap, but 1 think that'» rather rot. I'i
keen on SWINBURNE and LOCKSLKY HALL, and those chaps,
think LOCKSLKY HALL 's my favourite poet, ((fathering fi-ot
Mrs. ONSLOW'S expreaaion that he is getting out of his depth, an

OUR OWN PRIVATE VIEW. R.A.
THIS year's art, as evidenced at the Academy, seems to be
specially prolific in sucklings, babes and small childen. No
.vonder, then, that Master HARRY, HARRY'S son, who is a very
early master, should find in this show special opportunities for
lis own peculiar style of recording draughtsmanship.
14. "The King's Yeoman." By Mr. ARTHUR GARRATT. For a
feoman, a real good old Beefeater, associated always with
5alaces and Drawing Rooms, to come to a Garratt is probably
he reason why this Beefeater, aged and thin, with very little
beef in him, only the costume being "full," should appear so
melancholy. Some of us have not quite forgotten that ancient
'Yeoman of the Guard," eh?
17. Portrait of a lady. By SOLOMON J. SOLOMON, A. The lady
s in very pretty evening dress. There is a puzzled expression
on her face as she lifts her left arm and places her finger on
her 'left shoulder. What's the matter? A hidden pin? A
mosquito bite? What is it? Motto, "Noli me tangere," as the
lady said to the insect.
24. The Rev. Canon Wood, D.D. By DOROTHEA M. WOOD.
r is an ecclesiastical puzzle to the simple laic. Being attired
in Genevan bands, cardinal's scarlet, black University (?) scarf,
ring (episcopal?) on his finger, likewise wearing an embroidered
surplice, what is he? Apparently several ecclesiastical digni-
taries rolled into one. "A big gun," not a mere " canon."
82. W. if. F. Lyon, Esq. By GEORGE WATSON. In full hunt-
ing costume. A Lyon-hunter. But, cheer up, Sir, in spite of
your having on your right (31) ADAMS' "Morning Mists," from
which you are despondingly turning uway, you have below you,

gentleman, shown by Mr. SEYMOUR LUCAS, R.A., singing merrily

curious black-beetle-crushing boots.
85. "The Rome Wind." By C. NAPIKR HEMY, A. Might bo
two Hemy-grants from another Hemy-sphere, who had taken a
boat and put to sea in order to get home quickly. "Sale «nd
Return." Delightfully breezy.
92. Pretty lady, shown by ROSE D. BONNOR, attired for going
out, and waiting for her friend, or friends, to fetch her. If
her friends are not " fetching," she is.
03. GEORGE W.JOY. A Joyous picture of "Britannia" aa
"an armour-clad." Let us hope that this is " a lasting Joy,"
likewise " a thing of beauty," which is " a Joy for e%-er!"
98. A Dunn I Don't be frightened, not the ordinary sort of
"Dun," but a portrait, very well Dunn, by SOLOMON J. SOLOMON
(that's two of 'em, ergo, why not call himself "SOLOMONS"?)
of a good old sportsman in hunting toggery, grasping his whip and

Tramping the East for a home,
Seeking in vain through sunshine and rain,
We wearily, drearily roam;
While our little ones whimper at heel
Through dismal dark alleys and slums,
And weary and wet and hungry, they fret
For home—but the home never comes.
The birds of the air have their nests,
The beast of the field has his den
Where his limbs may repose in the spot that he knowa—
But what of us children of men?
No rest for the soles of our feet,
But still to new scenes we must change,
Still, still be unknown, without homes of our own,
And strangers 'mid all that is strange.
Trudge, trudge, trudge,
Wo struggle, with labouring breath
And tottering knees, through dens of disease
And hovels of sickness and death.
Trudge, trudge, trudge,
Dog-weary in body and mind
We ply our sad quest without hope, without rest,
But never a home can we find.

DRAMATIC SEQUELS.
OCTAVIAN AND CLEOPATRA.
THIS is not, as might at first be
imagined, a sequel to the Antony and
Cleopatra of SHAKSPEARE, but to the
Ccesar and Cleopatra of Mr. GEORGE
BERNARD SHAW. Unlike SHAKSPEARE'S
famous tragedy, it is written with a
scrupulous regard for the facts of history,
and, Mr. SHAW, if we would let him,
would be happy to prove in a prefatory
essay that its dialogue is not only true
to life, but is substantially a reproduc-
tion of what was actually spoken in the
year B.C. 31, by the characters.
SCENE—An extravagantly furnished apart-
ment in the Palace at Alexandria.
CLEOPATRA is discovered seated upon
her throne. She is dressed with
mournful splendour, as befits a queen
who has been defeated at Actium
and has suffered a recent bereave-
ment. Her face is as attractive as a
liberal use of cosmetics can make it,
and lier whole appearance is t/iat of
a middle-aged and rather dissipated
member of the corps de ballet, who has
gone into half-mourning because the
manager has reduced her salary.
CHARMIAN, a pretty, shrewish-looking
damsel, is in attendance on her.
Cleopatra (nervously). Am I looking my
best, CHARMIAN?
Charaiian (sulkily). Your majesty is
looking as well as / can make you. If
yon are not satisfied you had better get
another maid.
Cleo. (looking at herself in hand mirror).
Silly child. Of course I am satisfied. I
think you are wonderful.
Char, (mollified). Yes. I think I 've not
done so badly.
Cleo. Of course, with ANTONY not even
buried yet it would hardly have done for
me to be too magnificent.
Char, (decidedly). Most unsuitable.
Cleo. As it is, I think we 've arrived at
a rather successful blend of splendour and
sorrow, suggesting at once the afflicted
widow and the queen who is open to con-
solation.
Char. That is certainly the impression
we intended to convey. By the way, when
does C.«SAR arrive?
Cleo. OCTAVIAN? Almost at once.
Char. His first visit, isn't it?
Cleo. Yes. So much depends on a first
impression. (Looks at mirror again.) I
think we shall captivate him.
Char, (dubiously). He's not very im-
pressionable, I hear.
Cleo. No. But I shall manage it. Think
how completely 1 fascinated JULIUS.
Char. His uncle? I 'm afraid that's
hardly a reason why you should prove
equally attractive to the nephew.
Cleo. My dear child,, why not?
Char. Well — the lapse of time, you
know. That was seventeen years ago.
ILLUSTRATED QUOTATIONS.
(One no seldom 'f/cA- an Artist who realises the poetic conception.)

'I HAVB BEEN DBBAMINO. OF A THINll UKK THE*."— Wade.
Cleo. How horrid you are. I wish you
hadn't such an accurate memory for dates.
Char. Yes, dates are stubborn things.
Cleo. (pettishly). That's no excuse for
perpetually reminding me of them. 1
declare I 've a good mind to have you
executed.
Char, (tranquilly). Your majesty will
hardly do that. I am the only person in
Egypt who really understands the secret
of your majesty's complexion.
Cleo. That's true. But you ought to be
more tactful.
Char, (tossing her head). You can't ex-
pect me to display tact when my wages
haven't been paid since the battle of
Actium.
Cleo. Poor child! Never mind, when
OCTAVIAN is at my feet you shall be pai-J
in full. Will that satisfy you?
Char. I 'd much rather have something
on account.
Cleo. I wish you wouldn't vex me in this
way just when it's so important that I
should look my best. You know how 'tin-
becoming temper is to a woman when she
is ... well, over thirty (beginning to cry).
Char. There, there! 1 'm sorry I said
anything to hurt you. Don't cry, for
Heaven's sake, or that rouge will run.
Then I shall have to go all over you again.
Dry your eyes, there 's a good creature.
(CLEOPATRA does so obediently.) I declare
you 're all in streaks. Come here, and let
me put you straight.
[CLEOPATRA goes to CHARMIAN it'ho pro-
duces powder-puff,etc.,and repairs
the ravages of emotion. •
Cleo. Quick, quick! They 're coming. I
hear them. I 'm glad he 's so early. Only
a quarter of an hour after his time.
(Proudly) That shows how eager he is to
see me! I feel that this is going to be
another of my triumphs.
[CHARMIAN puis flic finishing touch to
the Queen just as C.ESAR enters.
She then hastily conceals poioder-
puff, etc., behind her. CLEOPATRA
has no time to return to the throne,
and stands rather awkwardly with

CHARMIAN to receive her visitors.
These prove to be OCTAVIAN, a
pale, dyspeptic-looking young man
of about thirty; AGRIPPA, a bluff,
thick-set, red-faced warrior past
middle-age, and a guard of lloman
soldiers.
Octauian (looking round the gorgeous
apartment with much disgust, and speak-
ing in a soft, weary voice). Ugh! Bad
taste, very bad taste all this.
Agrippa. You know what these bar-
barians are. (To the two women) Kindly
inform the Queen ('.rs\i: is here.
Cleo. (advancing). I am the Queen. How
do you do?
Agr. You! Nonsense!
Cleo. (archly). Oh, yes, I am.
Oct. (with gentle melancholy). Dear,
dear, another illusion gone 1
Cleo. Illusion?
Oct. Your beauty, you know; your
grace, your charm. I had heard so mnch
of them. So had AGRIPPA. Let me intro-
duce you, by the way. AGRIPPA—CLEO-
PATRA. (Wearily) As I was saying, it is
most disappointing.
Agr. (gruffly). Not what I expected at
all! [CHARMIAN giggles furtively.
Cleo. (puzzled). You—don't admire me?
Oct. (tjc.ii.Hij). Admire you? My dear
lady!
Cleo. (bridling). ANTONY was of a
different opinion.
Agr. (bluntly). ANTONY was a fool.
Oct. Hush, my dear AGRIPPA! You hurt
her feelings.
[AGRIPPA shrugs his shoulders and
crosses to CHARMIAN, with whom
he commences a rigorous flirtation.
Cleo. (angrily). Never mind my feelings.
Oct. Frankly then, dear lady, we are
not impressed. We came here prepared
for a beautiful temptress, a dazzling siren
whom I must resist or perish, something
seductive, enticing. And what do we find?
Cleo. (furious). Well, what do you find?
Oct. (in his gentlest voice). Dear lady,
don't let us pursue this painful subject.
Probably we had not allowed for the flight
of time. Suffice it that our poor hopes are
unrealised. (Looking round) But I don't
see C.i-s \itii>\.
Cleo. (sullenly). My son is not here.
Oct. Another disappointment.
Cleo. You wished to speak to him?
Oct. Yes. They talk of him as a son of
JULIUS, don't they?
Cleo. He is a son of JULIUS.
Oct. A sort of relation of mine, then?
I must really make his acquaintance. Can
you give me his address?
Cleo. (*ii!!,il 11). No. If you want him,
you will have to find him for yourself.
Oct. (blandly). I shall find him, dearest
Queen. You need be under no apprehen-
sions about that.
Cleo. Brute!
Oct. Eh?
Cleo. Nothing. I was only thinking.
Oct. Never think aloud, dear lady. It's
a dangerous habit.
Cleo. (impatiently). Is there anything
further you want with me 1
Oct. (affably). Nothing, thank you,
nothing. At least, nothing just now.
CJeo. You would like to see me later?
Oct. (gentler than a sucking dove). In a
few weeks, perhaps. The Triumph, you
know. The sovereign people throwing up
their caps and hallooing. The Procession
up the Sacred Way, with the headsman at
the end of it all. (Yawning slightly) The
usual thing.
Cleo. (losing her temper). Oh, you 're
not a man at all 1 You 're a block, a
stone! You have no blood in your veins.
You 're not like ANTONY.
Oct. No, dear lady, Ii'm not like ANTONY.
If I were, I shouldn't have beaten him at
Actium.
Cleo. I won't stay to be baited in this
•way. I won't I I won't!
[Goes towards door.
Oct. (gallantly). Farewell, then. We shall
meet again. AGRIPPA, the Queen is going.
Agr. (breaking off in the midst of his
flirtation). Eh? Oh, goodbye.
Cleo. (stamping her foot). CHARMIAN!
[Exit.
[CHARMIAN jumps tip, kisses her hand
to AGRIPPA and follows her mistress
out.
Agr. (looking after her). That's a pretty
little minx.
Oct. (who has seated himself wearily on
the throne). Is she? I didn't notice . . .
C.«SARION'S fled.
Agr. So I supposed.
Oct. It's a great nuisance. We must
find him. Will you see about it?
Agr. If you wish it. What shall I do
with him?
Oct. (in his tired voice). Better put him
to death. It will save a lot of trouble in
the end.
Agr. But the boy 's your own cousin.
Oct. Yes. I have always disliked my
relations.
Agr. (admiringly). I begin to think you
nre a genius, C.fSAR, after all.
Oct. I am. Much good it does me! I 'd
give my genius for your digestion any day.
[Leans back on throne and closes his eyes.
Enter CHARMIAN hurriedly, looking pale
and dishevelled.
Char. Help! Help! The Queen is dying.
Oct. (irritably, opening his eyes). Stop
that noise, girl! You make my head
ache.
Char. She is dying, I tell you. She has
taken poison. [Exit, squealing.
Agr. Poison, by Jove!' Confound it,
she mustn't do that, must she?
[7s about to follow CHARMIAN.
Oct. Why not? It seems to me an
excellent arrangement. Very thoughtful
of her. Very thoughtful and considerate.
Agr. But we want her for that Triumph
of yours.
Oct. Never mind. After all, what is a
Triumph? Disagreeable for her. A bore
for us. Let her die now, by all means, if
she prefers it.
Agr. (impatiently). Don't you try and
[je magnanimous too. Leave that to your
uncle. He did it better.
Oct. (wearily). My dear AGRIPPA, how
stupid you are. What possible use can a
quite plain and middle-aged lady be in a
triumphal procession? If CLEOPATRA were
still attractive I should say, "Save her,
by all means." As she isn't, (yawning) I
think we may let her die her own way
without being charged with excessive
magnanimity.
Agr. (regretfully). Still I should nave
liked to have seen her brought to Home.
Oct. Ah. I shall be quite contented to
see her comfortably in her coffin in Egypt.
We '11 let her be buried beside ANTONY.
It will gratify the Egyptians, and it won't
hurt us. See to it, there's a good fellow.
[Exit AGRIPPA. OCTAVIAN leans back,
and falls asleep on the throne.
ST. 3. H.
TO PHYLLIS.
FAIREST PHYLLIS, May is come,
Leaves are bursting, blossoms budding,
On the lawn the insects hum,
Overhead white clouds are scudding—
So Spring's joys pass swiftly by;
Let us taste them while they fly.
Ah 1 youth's happiness we prize,
Idle though the world may judge it;
Let them then our joys despise,
Wrangle over Bill and Budget,
Toil and pinch, and suffer pain,
Fame and worthless wealth to gain.
While discordant parties shout,
You are wise and do not heed them;
Books that wrap men's minds in doubt
Harm you not, you do not read them,
Well content with me to stand
In this garden hand in hand.
Sing Spring's carols while you may
Ere they turn to Winter's dirges;
As for me I 'm growing grey,
And for you youth's pleasure urges—
In another year or so
You must go to school, you know.
NOTE AND QUERY FROM WILLIAM
WHELK.—Dear Mr. Punch, I see that Mr.
REGINALD SMITH, of the British Museum,
has been excavating the Ancient British
Estate of Winkleburj/, near Basingstoke.
He has found a boar's tusk and some bones,
according to the report in the Pall .M-.tti
Gazette. Surely, if the place is so called
in consequence of their having buried
'winkles—which is short for periwinkles,
you know—in that spot, he must also have
discovered any amount of pins. Will you
kindly enquire, and oblige?

ONE MORE!
WHY did the strawberries cry?
Because the cream was whipped.
THE ACTOR-MANAGEK DISCOUESES.
n.
MY Lord, I have your gratifying lines
Which do us equal honour, me and you.
You have, I notice, thoughtfully perused
The critics' judgment on my latest -work,
Wherein they dwell with proper English pride
Upon the service I have done to Art.
That soft impeachment I will not deny.
Nor do I simply claim that in my person
I touch the highest single peak of Art,
As the Divine Interpreter of Life,
Nature's Protagonist; I also am
The magnet which attracts the lesser arts,
The link that binds them by a common lure.
Patron of letters, silent but for me,
I give to poetry (or else to prose)
The thing they lack—sublime articulation;
And from my bounteous hand the chosen scribe
Whom I delight to honour bears away
The most enormous guerdons ever known.
Patron of plastic art, the living kind,
I have an exquisite regard for form;
And, by the rhythmic postures I assume,
Teaching my company likewise to pose
As breathing statues, ambulant at will,
I give the astonied sculptor food for thought.
Patron of harmony, I set my seal
On incidental music. I permit
Triumphant blasts to advertise my coming,
Appropriate strains to punctuate my words,
And melting passages to mark the close;
Yet ever keep the lower art in check
So that it serves, but not obscures, the higher.
Patron of painting also, I command
Expert professors of the larger brush
(For whose colossal schemes a fitting scope
May not be found on ordinary walls)
To bid the Titan canvas speak aloud;
Yet not so loud that, when I walk the stage,
Their art should show as other than an adjunct
To emphasise and throw in fair relief
My dominating personality;
While for the drop-scene, which concerns me less,
Being my background merely when I bow,
And rather meant to soothe the general brain
Narcotically to beguile the time
Vacant between the visions of myself—
Here I allow a wider latitude,
Letting my workmen's fancy play at large;
And, if I judge them rightly by results,
It is a liberty they much enjoy.
Such, then, the arts to which I give a home;
And yet I have not mentioned nearly all.
Take architecture; I encourage that;
Eclectic, I extend a helping hand
To representatives of various styles,
Gothic, Flamboyant, Perpendicular,
Rococo, and of Italy new-born.
Under my wing the decorative arts
Flourish like bay-trees all about the building.
A careless luxury pervades the place
Rich in seraglio-spoils and Tyrian dyeS. •
Druggets of Ind, and enervating plush;
The walls are eloquent with fresco-work
Vaguely suggestive of the Sistine vault;
Pillar and portal, bar and balustrade
Aspire in marble (real, not imitation)
Expressly hewn for me in fabulous climes,
And tinted naturally like a rainbow.
Nor do I overlook the humblest arts.
The dull mechanic toils at my behest
Shifting the scenery ; the lime-light person
Plays round me with his concentrated moons;
To me the wig-man dedicates his wares,
And the costumier takes his breath from me.
I give her cue to Fashion ; when I move
In evening dress, conducting social plays,
As from a leading tailor's patterned block
The youth of London learns the latest mode;
And to my ladies' gowns (inspired by me)
Critics devote their best appreciations,
Often extending to a semi-column.
Some other minor services to Art,
May have escaped my notice; and, indeed,
I hardly care to labour instances
Which might convey a hint of self-esteem.
Enough has been advanced to prove that I
Am something more than mere consummate Master
In what the world accounts as the profession;
That I attach or focus to myself
All sister arts, confederate to form
A kind of Universal Exhibition;
Like certain splendid patrons, known to fame,
Tyrants and others, who encouraged Art,
Yet cannot properly be called my peers
Since they were only amateurs themselves;
As DIONYSIUS of Syracuse,
FRANCIS the First, Pope JULIUS the Second,
AUGUSTUS, PERICLES, and Monsieur LOUBET.
Once more, my Lord, I willingly accept
Your compliments. It is my pleasure to
Reciprocate them; I enclose a Box.

"ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD."
(From Diary of Sam Peeps, Junior.)
May 1.—Up betimes. To Westminster, where a review of the
Thames fleet. A great crowd both by land and water, and well
worth seeing. The boats all newly painted and mighty brave
with flags and bunting, so that it was the finest sight that ever
I did see in all my life, and makes me resolve in future ever to
go by water, being both for cheapness, speed and comfort,
better than the crowded streets where so many coaches.
May 2.—To Westminster. Bought a ticket for Chelsea; cost
me 2d. Having waited half-an-hour, was told the boats ran every
ten minutes. By-and-by, a boat, and all well till Vauxhall
Bridge, where the tide somewhat strong and the boat weak;
we could by no means pass, but swept back so often as we
reached the piers. A mighty crowd on bridge, and cheered
lustily, to our no small indignation, but being held by the tide
could in no wise escape, and at their mercy more than half-an-
hour. And so anon back to Lambeth, where all ashore. I was
for keeping my ticket, to use upon another occasion, but the
man would not suffer me to pass. Cost me 2d. and upwards of an
hour to travel three furlongs, and makes me doubtful as to ever
again going by water.

(MAY 15, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHAT THE ZOO EEALLY WANTS!
(Report of a Midnight Mass-Meeting of Representative Denizens.)
THE ELEPHANT (-who, on the motion of the JACKAL, -was
unanimously voted into the chair) said they wore met together
that evening to consider the present highly unsatisfactory
state of their accommodation in those Gardens. (" Hear, hear!"
and groans.) He thought the general trend (great applause) was
towards a thorough overhauling of all our old-established
institutions. Any weight he might have should be thrown into
the scale of ReCorm. There was much that needed setting
right. (Cheers.) For instance, he could not think it was quite
fair that he and his hon. friend the CAMEL should be the only
animals compelled to ply for hire as public conveyances. He
considered the LION and the TIGER ought to take their turn at
this -work. (The KANGAROO. "Hear, hear!")
The LION had no objection in the world to the proposal—
provided he were licensed to carry passengers inside as well as
out.
The TIGER was quite ready to consider the suggestion, as
amended. What lie chiefly complained of was the scandalous in-
sufficiency of the catering. He would like to see every animal
provided at least with a live baby on his birthday, and possibly
on Bank Holidays. (Cheers from all the CARNIVORE.) From the
lowest point of view, he thought it would draw the Public. He
felt sure he could rely on the support of his hon. friend, if he
would allow him to term him so, the GIRAFFE.
The GIRAFFE said that, as a confirmed vegetarian, he was of
opinion that dates contained more sustenance to the square
inch than their equivalent in babies. (Uproar.) Well, it was
purely a matter of taste. Where he ventured to think the
authorities wanting was in their neglect to provide more
facilities for exercise. (Loud applause.) Why not transform the
whole of the Regent's Park into a desert? A few cart-loads of
sand, a palm or two, and the thing would be done. Then
individuals like his friend the SLOTH, for instance, would be
encouraged to lead healthier lives.
The SLOTH was understood to remark that exercise was all
skittles. Let every animal be given a good old-fashioned four-
post bedstead, and never be called except for meals, and they
would hear no more grumbling. He appealed to his friend the
LYNX.
The LYNX said his friend the SLOTH had, in appealing to him,
come—if they would pass the expression—to the wrong shop.
He generally sat up all night, and never slept except with one
eye open. The Gardens always closed just when he was begin-
ning to feel lively and ready to make an evening of it.
The POLAR BEAR was prepared to support the GIBAFFE'S
scheme with a slight modification. None of your sandy deserts.
Make the entire Park into a Skating Rink, with real ice and
real icebergs (even artificial would be better than nothing)
At present, the place was disgracefully overheated. ("No
no!" from the SALAMANDER.) Perhaps his friend would allow
him to know what he was talking about. All he could say was
that, since his arrival in those Gardens, he had never once
known what it was to feel comfortably cool.
The HIPPOPOTAMUS thought there should be some opportunity
afforded for innocent social recreation. They might rail in a
space, engage the Pink Pomeranians, and allow the animals to
meet, say, every Saturday evening, fora friendly dance. Hislfrienc
the HYENA appeared to be amused—but, if his laughter impliec
any allusion to the speaker's figure, he might inform him thai
stout persons were notoriously the most graceful performers ir
the Terpsichorean Art. Not that he went in for round dances—
only square—still, he nattered himself—(Boars of laughter, lee
by the HYENA, amidst which the speaker sat down).
The OSTUICH said ho enjoyed a waltz occasionally, but he
liked lots of room for it. Personally, he would rather see a
Cinder track laid down all round the Park and sprinting races
instituted. He would back himself for a pound of brass-headed
lai Is and a pocket corkscrew to give the PELICAN and TOUCAN
a thousand yards start, and beat their old beaks off.
The PELICAN regretted that he was no longer an Athlete.
But he was still a keen sportsman, and would like to see every
animal there allotted his private lake, with the fishing strictly
preserved. Think what it would mean to an overworked person
ike his friend the CAMEL to get away occasionally for a quiet
day's fishing.
A BLUE-NOSED BABOON considered they all required some form
of rational amusement. He -was sick and tired of pulling a
smaller monkey's tail, and then bolting. Why shouldn't they
)e given a Switchback Railway, or a Steam Merry-go-Round?
But even a Rocking-Horse in every cage would afford them some
ntellectual diversion. They had a rocking-horse, he knew, at
the Manchester Zoo, also a pump with a movable handle.
The RHINOCEROS said if anyone dared to put a Rocking-Horse
n his stable, he would rip it open. Ah, he would, though!
Bolder measures were wanted if the Zoo was to be rendered
decently habitable. Hix idea was: Keep out the Public, turn
the Gardens into a jungle, with plenty of swamp, and then let
all the animals loose to enjoy themselves in their own fashion.
They wouldn't be bothered with Keepers very long after that.
The RUSSIAN WOLF doubted whether the Swamp would hold
water. He had a better plan. Lay down five feet of snow over
the whole Park, throw it open to the public, and get them to
take up sleighing. There was worse fun, he could assure them,
then chiveying a sleigh with a couple of crocks and a confirmed
roarer in the traces.
The TORTOISE said that was not a form of amusement that
particularly appealed to him. He preferred burrowing, and lie
attributed his perfect health at his advanced age entirely to a
lifelong abstinence from violent physical exercise and excite-
ment.
The SEAL advocated the erection of a Waterchute, like the
one at Earl's Court. Boats would not be required, as they could
easily slide down on their stomachs. He merely threw out the
suggestion. (Interruption.)
The Chairman. We all throw it out. Preposterous! It is a
pity some people haven't more imagination! (The SEAL resumed
his seat.)
The BROWN BEAR said it appeared to him that the grand
mistake all previous speakers had made was to regard this
important question too much from a personal point of view.
He had a proposition which he ventured to think avoided that
error, and consulted the general convenience. Let the Committee
give each animal a good large pit all to himself—(Applause.)—
he had not finished yet. Let that pit be provided—not with a
clumsy old-fashioned climbing pole—but an up-to-date hydraulic
lift. Surely they saw the advantage of that? Why, when they
noticed a particularly attractive infant above, with a bun or
what-not, all they would have to do would be to step into the
lift, be carried comfortably up, and, well—help themselves.
If their comforts were only studied a little more in little things
like that, he was sure they would all be better and happier beasts.
The BEAVER considered that their chief grievance was the
housing accommodation, which was totally inadequate. He
attributed this to the employment of Human Architects instead
of animals like themselves, who are naturally the best judges of
of their own requirements. Give him plenty of time and build-
ing materials, and he would undertake to re-house the whole
population on a scientific and sanitary system of his own.
(Interruption.) He had been building ever since he was born,
and was he to be told that he did not know his business by that
time? He knew from whence those ignoble attempts to howl
him down proceeded—from envious and incompetent amateurs
like (The remainder of the BEAVER'S remarks was inaudible
from the gallery.)
Other speakers followed, but the meeting broke up about
4.30 A.M. in some confusion, without having adopted any definite
scheme of improvement, and was adjourned sine die. F. A.

IT isn't FLABSTER'S fault—I know all
about that; but he 's one of the most de-
pressing men 1 ever met. lie carries
about him the atmosphere of a chemist's
shop, and always looks as if he had
swallowed tbe wrong medicine. He's
the kind of man who never has a sensible
straightforward illness, but has per-
petually some liuiiii'kiiift little ailment
that afflicts his friends far more thau it
afflicts him. He makes it a rule to tell
his family history after he 's known you
about two minutes. His grandfather was
a martyr to asthma, and his grandmother
suffered from nerves. So, probably, on
consideration did the grandfather, but
FLABSTER never enlarged on that point.
Then his father But FLABSTER will
tell you all about it when you see him.
"Heredity, my friend," says he k(I'm
not his friend, but that's one tof FLAB-
STER'S hasty assumptions); "diathesis—
gouty diathesis!"
"Dire nuisance," I murmur under my
breath, then try to look sympathetic.
"1 tell you what," said FLABSTBR
solemnly to me one; day. "If people
always took a small quantity of liquid
at the end of meals they would be far
better."
"A liqueur does make a difference," I
assented heartily, — if somewhat mali-
ciously.
He regarded me with a look of bilious
reproach, and I fled.
One could forgive FLABSTER for not
being enthusiastic about the English
climate. But no climate was ever known
to suit him. If you meet him in the

Engadiue in radiant weather he complains
dismally about vertigo and over-stimula-
tion from the air, and not even the most
obvious witticisms will shame him.
One superb June I met him in Venice.
I thought him looking very well, and
ventured on the observation. Of course
he denied it, with tbe air of a man whose
moral character has been besmirched and
who despairs of ever being understood.
"I thought you would say so," he
remarked with a gloomy smile. "It's the
peculiarity of malarial complaints"
Then I recollected an appointment and
made for the nearest gondola.
FLABSTER is well-to-do: a man should
take his gout where he gets his gold, and
be thankful. He has no particular work
to do (if he had, perhaps his health
would improve); yet he is always taking
a holiday because ho is "run down." I
wish—but no, that's brutal I
No doubt his ancestors have bequeathed
•various unpleasant little legacies; but
that's no reason why other folk should
pay duty on them. FLABSTER should re-
member that there are other forms of
light literature besides QUAIN'B Dictionary
of Medicine. A. R.

conceded at last moment. Anyhow, will
get division at this sitting; more Members
than ever want to talk; give them a
quarter of an hour, or, at most, twenty
minutes apiece, and might have useful,
interesting debate. And here "s BROTHER
GERALD, of all men in the world, rising
after EDWARD GREY and talking for an
hour and twenty minutes. If some enemy
had done this thing, if it were an Irish
Member, it would be the expected and
must be endured. But the President of
the Board of Trade!
0 GEBALD, 0 mon frire,
Le bon sons t'abandonne.
This start enough to cripple any debate;
did not recover for hours. Towards mid-
night LAMBTON lifted the cloud with
breezy speech in which, to delight of
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, he "went for" ST.
MICHAEL. In other passages mentioned
some interesting autobiographical inci-
dents. Appears that this scion of the
Durham family, beginning his oratorical
career lisped, not in numbers but, in
measures. To be precise, in coal measures.
Years ago, when a boy at Eton, distur-
bance in the coal trade was made topic
of debate at Pop. Naturally, young
LAMBTON an authority on the subject;
delivered a speech which settled contro-
versy. To-night read to attentive House
summary report of proceedings. Debate
in House of Commons from time of
BURKE and Pox, frequently quoted at
Pop. Never before was House of Commons
treated to intellectual educational advan-
tage of learning what had been said by
short-jacketed statesmen settling affairs
of universe in that Cradle of Cabinet
Ministers.
Business done.—Coal Tax Resolution
carried by 833 votes against 227.
Tuesday.—The MEMBER FOR SARK has a
curious theory about the Member for
Carmarthen District. According to com-
mon report, Mr. Pickwick has been dead
these many years. SARK insists that he is
back with us in the flesh, and has assumed
the name of ALFRED DAVIES. Of course,
there can be nothing in it. But, really,
when you watch Mr. DA VIES advancing a
pace on to the floor of the House with
intent to unmask DON JOSE, one recalls
Sam Weller's immortal master. Put Mr.
DAVIES in tights and gaiters, with one
hand behind his coat-tails, the other
waving in the air to assist his denuncia-
tion of the Author of all Modern Evil, and

"ME. PICKWICK" REDIVIVUS!
"Will the right hon. Gentlemen the Colonial
Secretary do iue the honour of replying to my
Question, nnd will he also have the kindness to
make himself audible? May I also so far presume
as to «sk for strict silence while the answer to 11n •
Question U given?"
(Mr. Alfr-d D-v-s.)
you have Mr. Picku'ick to a gaiter button.
Owing to nature of Mr. DAVIES'S self-
appointed mission in the House, it is
Me. Pickivick in his severest moments—
Mr. Pickii'ick meditating over the iniqui-
ties of Job Trotter, made known in the
confidences of Sam Weller.
When he has a Question to put indica-
ting discovery of some fresh enormities
at Colonial Office, Mr. DAVIKS strategi-
cally secures a seat on front bench below
the Gangway, whence he can watch the
conscience-stricken COLONIAL SECRETARY
awaiting the moment of peril. Before
the Bench, drawn on the matting, runs
a thin red line, reminiscent of duelling
days. Wlien GEORGE f THE THIRD was
King Members were prone in the heat of
argument to advance a pace across the
floor with intent to pink each other; this
line was drawn, and order issued that no
gentleman addressing the House should
cross it. Mr. DAVIES, intent on "getting
at" DON Josti, disregards the injunction
which, the ancient cause non-existent,
abides to this day. Stopping well out
beyond the line, so that the House may
contemplate the Pickwickian outline of
face and figure, he fixes a piercing eye
on DON JOSE, puts his Question, resumes
his seat, magisterially crosses one short
leg over the other, and waits to hear
what prisoner in the dock has to say.
Usually, by way of preface, he wags a
forefinger at the culprit, instructing him
how he should answer, and informing him
it is no use his endeavouring to wriggle
out of the tight place into which Mi-.
Pickwick's acumen and knowledge of
affairs have thrust him.
His buoyancy, his bubbling-over con-
viction that the terrible Minister has at
length found his match, combined with
DON JOSK'S stern repressal of instinct and
desire to tear the little man into shreds,
supplies a bit of comedy precious in dull
times.
Businens done.— JOHN O'GoRST, time-
honoured Educationalist, brings in a new
Bill. Laboriously explains that it is not
intended to touch the School Board or
interfere with their work; will merely
control the latter, and in course of time
will swallow the former. "But they will
be very comfortable inside," says JOHN
O'GORST, nodding assuringly at gentlemen
opposite, champions of the School Boards.
Thursday.—SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE
dipping into history came out a little
mixed in colour. Been looking up epoch
of Wars of the Roses, in search of support
for his argument that what are known as
hereditary revenues don't descend from
father to son in the long list of British
sovereigns.
"When," he said, "HENRY IV., who
represented the White Rose"
"EDWARD! EDWARD!" cried Members
later from school.
"Very well, EDWARD," said the SAGE,
to whom a trifle here or there is nothing.
"When EDWARD IV. represented the Red
Rase"
"HENRY ! HENRY !" cried Members.
The SA<;E stood aghast. What did they
mean? He said HRNRY to begin with;
they contradicted him; he accepted their
correction ; now they contradicted again.
Hit high or hit low, he could not please
them.
"HENRY, exactly; I was right at first.
I said HENRY, you said EDWARD. Very
well; when he, HENRY, after the triumph
of the White Rose, came to the
throne"
"EDWARD! EDWARD!" shouted Mem-
bers.

(GRAVESEND) "PIER-RE AND HIS PEOPLE"!
Mr. G-lb-rt P-rk-r pilots a few friends from his constituency round the precincts!
Hadn't had such a bit of fun for a
long time. Earlier in the evening Mr.
WEIR led round the bull the people of
Rorroston, jealous of the privileges of
their neighbours of Carloway, desired to
borrow. The gravity he imported into
the procedure, contrasted with the levity
of the Lord Advocate, was good in these
doleful days. But nothing compared with
the SAGE'S distraction between the rival
Roses of York and Lancaster. Evidently
no use pursuing lino of argument. The
SAGE, rarely flustered, was hopelessly
bewildered. Didn't know a rose from a
cabbage, a king from a cotton-spinner;
turned aside to other branch of subject,
leaving in doubt his impression whether
"he, HENRY" (his flual but unsuccessful
effort at hedging), wore the Red Rose or
the White.
Business done.—The KING'S Civil List

Friday. — AuTOLYCUS MoUNTSTUART E.
GRANT DUFF,, throwing his wallet over
his shoulder, has been out again, picking
up more or less uncousidered trifles.
Forget how many previous volumes there
were. JOHN MURRAY just issued two new
ones, covering the epoch 1889-91. At
this rate, a pleased generation may
expect nine or ten more before AUTO-
LYCLH reaches the marge of the new
century. Never since Bos\\ ELI laid down
the pen was there such an industrious
chronicler of small talk. In justice to
him, it must be said he has not the per-
sonal charm that endears Bozzv to his
fellowmen. Dr. JOHNSON'S satellite was
undoubtedly vain, and looked down upon
OLIVER GOLDSMITH. GRANT DUFF'S self-
conceit is colossal, and from his artificial
altitude he looks down on everybody—
especially on Mr. GLADSTONE, who twice
gave him ofllce, made him Governor of
Madras, and Grand Cross of the Star
of India.
His industry in this occupation of de-
clining years is merciless. He even goes
out to breakfast if there is a chance
of picking up any crumbs falling from the
table. Envious neighbours charged
AtTOLYCUS with the gentle habit of steal-
ing from adjacent flocks, altering the
marks of ownership on his plunder, and
mingling them with his own sheep. In
two closely-printed volumes, crammed
with stories, it is natural that here
and there our modern Argonaut displays
hereditary tendency. But a large num-
ber of the stories are new, some of
them excellent. Sir MOUNTSTUART'S
many hosts and hostesses still living
will be pleased to be reminded of what
was said in the privacy of their break-
fast, luncheon, or dinner-table in bygone
years.

A POPULAR FALLACY.
["According to a popular but pessimistic author,
clothes are ' a fatal invention.' .... As they do
not add to the real heat of the body, i.-c.-as they
only prevent heet from escaping, we ihouid be more
warmly clothed and much less encumbered if we
increased the natural heat of the body: in other
words, we ought to find some means of substituting
food for clothes."—TAe Globe.]

But let it whistle as it will,
We '11 keep our temperature up still!
Phew! How the May North-easters blow
With rain and thunder, sleet and snow!
Phew! how the so-called zephyr moans
Amid its victims' tortured bones!
Fling off your coat and waistcoat—nay,
Not draw them closer !—Off, I say!
Clothes are an empty, senseless form,
Tis mere delusion that they 're -warm,
An out-of-date exploded notion.
They do but check the body's motion,
Stop circulation, make the blood
A stagnant, cold and frozen flood.
It follows, the more cold it grows,
The more you should dispense with clothes.
Off with them, then, and sing this gay
And spirit-rousing roundelay:
Oh, some sing the wines of Oporto,
And some sing of sparkling Tokay,
While others appear to appreciate beer
In a simply astonishing way.
But when I am offered such liquors,
With a shudder of fear I recoil,
Saying, thank you, good Sir; but the brand

Is cod-liver oil.
Allow me to mention its virtues.
Are you cold? Take a spoonful of

And the generous cup quickly covers you

Worn out with long labour and toil?
There is no need to stuff; you will soon
have enough
Of cod-liver oil.
Are you thirsty? Without hesitation
The spoon to your lip you may press
And drink to your fill, for the danger is
nil
You will suffer from any excess.

Your sense of enjoyment need spoil;

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IF it is a happiness for the erudite to communicate with the
profane in a form which hides the painful process of achieve-
ment and only gives the picturesque results, then (says my
Nautical Retainer) Mr. REGINALD BLOMFIELD is thrice blessed.
His S/iort History of Renaissance Architecture in England, 1500—
1800 (GEORGE BELL), an abridgment of his larger work, is a
remarkable example of the way in which history may be made
delightful by the charming manner of its presentment. The
reader is possessed by the confidence that comes of a sense of
the author's personal experience and observation; he knows
that he has to do neither with an amateur nor with a maker of
books out of books. Add to this that the volume is a very
gallery of illustrations, largely the work of the author's own
lavish and facile pen. In the unavoidable absence of a royal
road to the knowledge of architecture, here is a way,—with
Mr. BLOMFIELD for your charioteer—that makes a most deceptive
substitute.
In Plato's Handmaiden (JOHN LONG) LUCAS CLEEVE has given us
a vivid picture of one of the latest crazes, or phases, of modern
fashionable life. It is a carefully worked-out story, slight in
plot, and not rich]in incident, evincing, however, a carefully made
study of the men and women she is depicting. The peculiar
style of narration that LUCAS CLEEVE affects is occasionally
somewhat irritating, as, for instance, when, at some interesting
point, the author interposes paragraphically a short dialogue
that may probably take place some months or years afterwards,
or stops to consider what may be the effect in the distant future
of the action then passing under the reader's eyes. If LUCAS
CLEBVE would only avoid all attempts at dropping into epigram
and enigmatical moralising, the interest of the story, which is
a novel of character-development, would absorb the reader
from first to last. As it is, the interposed moralisings are dis~
tracting. The villain, a married woman with a past most care-
fully concealed, and a Becky-Sharpian talent for intrigue, is a
character drawn by a masterly hand, as, indeed, are all the
women in the story, though, perhaps, the simplicity of the
heroine is rather overdone. The warm-hearted, impressionable,
generous man of the world, who is as utterly unable to realise
the caddishness of his generosity towards "lovely woman in
distress "as he is to recognise the selfishness of what he con-
siders his true regard and great love for the object of his
disloyal passion, is another admirably drawn character. With-
out any reserve, save the trifling defect above-mentioned, the
Baron can strongly recommend this book to those who honour
him by following his advice. The book leaves the Baron still
puzzled over its title, Plato's Handmaiden / Why drag in
PLATO? Likewise, why fix that highly moral and respectable
sage with a '' handmaiden "? By any other name the book would
have been just as good, and there are ever so many titles at
hand far better than that chosen for it by LUCAS CLEEVE, at
least, such is the opinion of the criticising
BARON DB B.-W.

PICTURES MOUNTED.
MR. G. H. JALLAND, earnest sportsman
and jocose draughtsman, is now exhibit-
ing at the Pine Art Society's rooms in
New Bond Street a considerable number
of original pictures, reproductions of
which have from time to time appeared in
Mr. Punch's pages, where they were
"plain," but now, the sporting artist
having obtained "the brush," they are
coloured. A very bright show, scarlet
of course predominating, many of the
brilliant hunting scenes striking the eye
as quite "' the pink' of perfection." In
some instances, however, the idea is
suggested that the horses owe their bur-
nished coats to having been groomed at
the Coloured Lithographic Stables.
Many are already sold, as in another
sense will be the sportsmanlike collectors
who may be too late for the show. Re-
gard No. 5 one of the best. No. 68 is so
full of " go" (rare to be this at 68!) that
it may be gone altogether long ere this
appears to call public attention to it.
No. 22, "A capital Dodge," tells its own
tale and the horse's. No. 24. The Scare-
crow is delightfully absurd. No. 29 is
Leechian in idea, and better as a paint-
ing, for LEECH was not very strong as a

GOOD OLD TIMES REVIVED AT THE VAUDEVILLE.
Fon a while, at least, the theatre-going public
having lost ita taste for the " problem play," and
beginning to repent itself of its questionable
caprice for "the •woman with a past," turns to
the innocent themes that aforetime delighted its
dining-early fathers, as •well as its homely mothers,
its generous bachelor uncles, and its kindly spin-
ster aunts. Captain BASIL HOOD, author of the
very pretty and interesting comedy Siveet and Twenty which
has achieved a well-deserved success at the Vaudeville
Theatre, eschewing the dangerous ground of modern divorce-
court drama, has songht his model for an ideal domestic play
—a play, that is, that the rather artificial and simpering
young person can be taken to see without calling up the blush
to her powdered cheek,—in the style of piece with which the
early P., that is the early PiNERO, in his salad-dressing days,
made us familiar in Sweet Lavender; and, going back still
earlier, Captain BASIL HOOD evinces his sympathy with the
simple dramatic form which sufficiently served the purpose of
the social TOM ROBERTSON, and which was brought to perfection
by the tender-hearted, mildly punning THOMAS CRAVEN in The
Postboy and Meg's Diversions.
So our good old friend Domestic Drama is once again welcomed
back to its own home at the Vaudeville, whose reputation in
this kind of play was made by Messrs. JAMES and THORNE with
BYRON'S Our Boys, and, under the same management, with
ALBERT'S Two Roses. Yes, the Vaudeville is now the Domestic
Drama's "Home, sweet home," as in ROBSON'S time was the
Olympic, where it shared the house, as it did at the Strand and
Royalty Theatres, with burlesque.
And, as a connecting link with the past, in this present play
of BASIL HOOD'S is " an odd man," one Prynne, capitally played
by Mr. FRED EMNEY, in whose part there is scarcely a line
without a pun in it, reminding the old playgoer with a clear
memory of the manner of Jasper Pidgeon in Meg's Diversions,
and other similar characters. So the early Victorian low-
comedian, with puns as plentiful as plums in his speeches, is
not only revived but is going as strong as ever with a public
that thoroughly enjoys every line spoken by this eccentric old
Prynne.
The new order changeth giving place to old, and, to judge
from the unequivocal success of this experiment at the Vaude-
ville, the harking-back movement is already undeniably popular.
Yet, for all that, Captain BASIL HOOD is an uncommonly lucky
man; his lines have indeed fallen in pleasant places when they
have to be spoken by Miss ELLALINE TERRISS. As Joan Trevelyan,
the "sweet-and-twenty" heroine of the play, she is simply
perfect; and, having seen her in this, it is impossible to
imagine anyone on the London stage to whom the part would
be so exactly fitted. More touchingly, more tenderly, more
"sweetly" rendered, it could not be. Those who have not seen
Miss ELLALINE TERRISS as Joan have a genuine treat in store for
them. It is no detraction from the general and individual
excellence of the performance to express an opinion that, with-
out ELLALINE TERRISS as the heroine this simple play, in
some respects inartistic, especially in its lame finish, could
never have gained upon the public as it undoubtedly has done.
Mr. 3. n. BEVERIDOB, one of the best actors on the stage, to
whom any part might be safely confided, plays admirably the
Rev. James Floyd, an elderly clergyman, a manly character
who is neither preacher nor prig, and who is therefore from
the very first a favourite with the audience.
Mies MARY RORKE is invaluable as Ellen, the handsome
parlour-maid (whose age may be about thirty-five, and whose
"make-up" is most artistic), deeply attached to the family
whom she has served since the brothers Eustace and Douglas
Floyd were babies. For a parlour-maid on the stage the name
Ellen is rare: somehow, the nomenclature is happy and seems
of itself to lift the character out of and above the status
of the ordinary stage domestic maid-servant.
Miss VANE FBATHERSTONE flashes across the scene a brilliant
meteor, holds the stage for a while, has, indeed, a good flve-
minutes' solo with scarcely a second's breathing interval for any-
one to cut in with the briefest remark, and then—exit—and she
"is heard no more." Why this Mrs. Trevelyan ever came at all
is a query very difficult to answer satisfactorily; certainly Joan
could have got on without her by merely alluding to the ex-
istence of such a pei-son (whether aunt or mother, I could not
gather from anything said or done), just as the Floyd quartette,
Rev. James, Masters Eustace and Douglas and Chris (flrst-rate
little boy Mr. GEORGE HERSEE), get on without Mrs. Floyd (not
Aurora of that ilk 1 Poor Aurora!), who is perpetually being1
spoken of, but who, like the late Madame Benoiton in that
once popular comedy, is never seen nor even "heard without"
during the entire piece.
Mr. HOLBHOOK BLINN plays the very difficult part of the bad
brother with considerable artistic self-restraint. He makes
himself up, and makes himself out, worse than he is. He is
morbidly, biliously jealous. That Joan could ever have liked
him at all, or trusted him in the least, he being such a vampire-
looking sort of person, is just one of the two patent impro-
babilities of the play.
Mr. SEYMOUR HICKS, as Douglas Floyd, is the very man for
this breezy, youthful, rather feather-headed but very warm-
hearted sailor, and he makes the character go with the
audience for all it is worth. Nor is it necessary that the Cain
of this play (Mr. BLINN) should be so evidently a contrast to
the Abel as author and actors have apparently thought. The
lights and shades of the character of Douglas Floyd, the frank,
easy-going, open-hearted, yet for all that diffident and bashful
sailor, and then the deeply repentant prodigal son returned
home, are well brought out by Mr. SEYMOUR HICKS, who in
this part is suited down to the ground, or to the sea, and
shows in it a vein of pathos hitherto unexpected in so very
light a comedian. The episode of the toy pistol (this is the
second glaring improbability) is so preposterous that how it
escaped excision during rehearsal, that is, after the piece had
been accepted on the strength of the parts to be
played by Mr. HICKS and Miss ELLALINK TERRISS,
is a marvel even to one so practically versed in
the mysteries of stage-craft as is this present
critic. But "there's always a somethin',"
and in spite of these " somethin's " this piece
is in for a good run of public favour.

AN OLD FRIEND IN NEED.
AT a time when the question of coal is occupying so much
attention it may occur to some generous owners and tax-payers
that there is another way of spelling it, namely, the one adopted
by His Majesty the ancient King Cole, and not only by that
monarch, but also by one of our "queens of song," Madame
SUSANNAH COLE, who, as the public has recently been informed,
through no fault of her own but simply through misfortune, has
'alien on evil days and is now in need of charitable assistance.
Mr. BALFOUR granted Madame COLE a sum from the Royal
Bounty Fund, and Queen ALEXANDRA has not only expressed
ler kindly sympathy but has also given to it practical effect
n a handsome donation. Mr. Punch is informed that the well-
known music-hall publishers, Messrs. CHAPPELL, of Bond Street,
are kindly acting as treasurers to the fund, and to Messrs.
CHAPPELL, 50, New Bond Street, all subscriptions for the
'Madame COLE Fund" should be sent direct. The "live
COLE " is still bright and brilliant! Let us do our best to keep
ler so. She is now seventy-one, and—so the Daily Graphic
tells us—" her voice is still wonderful." So, musical public,
notes as a present for notes in the past.

mined to review his fleet, and, not without
a feeling of pride did he survey the vessels,
gorgeous in unlimited paint, and plenti-
fully bedecked with bunting. How
delieiously the paint smelt, how bril-
liant were the buttons of the skippers,
how truly Venetian the awnings!'' Yes,''
said Father Thames, as he swallowed
some gallons of smoke, "I have much
to be thankful for. Life has its joys and
its HILLS combined." Then he wondered
if the Mario Wood could not be tinkered
up, for she would certainly be in the best
of company.
THE
DIVERTING HISTORY OF
SOUTHEND LION HUNT.
THE
[A lion is said to be at large in the vicinity of
Southend. Parties of gentlemen, armed with
rifles obtained from the Southend (title Club,
have been busy "hunting" in the neighbouring
coverts. It was reported that persons had heard
the animal roar, and the children were afraid to
go to school. The "hunters," although encouraged
to persevere by curious "footprints" observed here
and there, have so far been unsuccessful in their
search. A gentleman living close by is of opinion
that the mysterious visitor is a stag. Whatever
the animal may be, it in still at large, and the
mystery is unsolved.—Daily Paper.]
BROWN was a sporting citizen
Of credit and renown
(And so were JONES and ROBINSON)
In famous Southend town.
Said BROWN to JONES and ROBINSON,
"Though gunning oft we 've been,
And slain confiding gulls, yet we
No big game e'er have seen:
"But now a lion fierce and grim
Has made its horrid lair
In yonder thicket wild, to which
To-morrow we '11 repair."
JONES soon replied, "Amongst the best
Of sportsmen you 're the one
I most admire "—and so, to all
Intent, said ROBINSON.
"Therefore this deed," continued JONES,
"Of daring shall be done "—
The hardy compact thus he made,
And so did ROBINSON.
The morning came, the sportsmen dressed
All in their loudest checks,
With cartridge-bags and hunting-knives
Suspended round their necks.
They shouldered with an air expert
The deadly tubes, which BROWN
Had borrowed from the Rifle Club
In famous Southend town.
And soon the woods and brakes resound,
For BROWN had thought it meet
To hire a hundred loafers bold
The coverts for to beat.

Mrs. Vanoof (aliapping in Paris). "Now LKT MB SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT EXTRA SPECIAL."
Salesman. "MADAM, WE 'AVB SOME VBE' FIN« Loois TREI/E."
Mr. Vanoof. "TRAYS, MAX! WHAT DO WE WANT WITS TRAYS!"
Mrs. Vanoof. "BETTIR TBY ONE OR TWO; THEY'RE ONLY A r.ouis."
Each sportsman flourished right and left
The unaccustomed arm,
The while he eyed his neighbour's with
But ill-concealed alarm.
From dawn to eve they beat the woods.
Throughout the country side,
And all the squires and gamekeepers
Were highly gratified.
They found no lion, but at last
They found a curious slot—
"A lion's or a stag's," said BROWN,
As he surveyed the spot.
"Their feet are very much alike,"
Said BROWN, and JONES agreed,
Whilst ROBINSON, as in duty bound,
Said, "Very much indeed."
Just then a fearful roar was heard.
Each sportsman turned to run.
BROWN fired at JONES by accident,
And JONES at ROBINSON.
Again the fearful roar rang out,
More near and yet more near—
Alas! Alas! "A braying ass
Did sing most loud and clear "!
The beaters noised the tale abroad,
And sadly now goes BROWN
(As also JONES and ROBINSON)
In famous Southend town.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WANDEEING IN "THE WILDERNESS."
FOR such success as The Wilderness may have achieved, its
author Mr. H. "V. ESMOND must gratefully thank the excellence
of his better half's (Mrs. ESMOND alias Miss EVA MOORE) per-
perfonnance as Mabel Vaughan, and must also acknowledge
the artistic quality of Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER'S Sir Harry
Milanor. Three-sixths of the praise, fractionally divided, must
be allotted to the actress, two-sixths to the leading actor,
while the remaining one-sixth must be divided among the
company generally, on whose talents no considerable call
is made. Outside these, so to speak, and appearing only
in the first act, are two small character-parts so well rendered
by Mr. LENNOX PAWLE and Mrs. EDWARD SAKER as to cause
regret at their total eclipse subsequent to their short half-
hour on the stage, after which they, condemned to a fate
similar to that of the "poor player who struts and frets,"
are '' heard no more.'' Ou t—out! ye two brief dramatic candles,
Lady Pawson and her son Mr. Gilbert; the latter, by the way,
could, without the stuffln' of tea and muffin, make up perfectly for
the Pat Boy in Picfcwicfc. [Happy thought! To write a play for
him as the hero and call it '' Joe.'' Not '' Poor Joe'' nor "Jo ";
these have been done. But "Joe" tout simple. Perhaps,
though, the answer may be "Not for Joe." So, to proceed.]
Mr. ALEXANDER certainly creates a part out of scanty
materials. It is clever, not very pleasant, for there is a
touch of cynicism in his manner that makes anything he says
and does, that has any heart in it, unreal. A man of thirty-five,
a millionaire, a responsible person, and a magnate in his
own county, who presumably received a public-school and
University training, who has seen the world at home and
abroad—a man of this stamp, a gentleman by birth and edu-
cation, talking as foolishly and inconsequently as a scatter-
brained youth of nineteen, and behaving as an irresponsible
being, a kind of youthful Harold Skimpole, is, as a character
in play or novel, an unsolvable problem. Have we renounced
the "problem play" to find the problem character? Yet just
when the part is beginning to be wearisome it suddenly becomes
interesting. This happens in the last act, from which, by the
way, a good ten minutes' worth of dialogue could be excised
much to the advantage of the play.
But if Sir Problem Bart, troubles the intelligent "friends in
front," in Mabel Vaughan, the flirt, the larky, the dangerously
high-spirited, impulsive yet calculating, unprincipled and
impudent, the budding adventuress who, converted by marriage,
into a true and devotedly loving wife, will be recognised a
living picture of a type far from rare, which has been seen on
the stage ere now, but never in so perfect'a presentment as is
now given us in Mabel Vaughan, that is, as played by Miss EVA
MOORE. So real, so natural, is she that one feels sympatheti-
cally inclined to persuade her from being so headstrongly
honest, and, after seven months of happiest possible wedlock,
so most unnecessarily communicative. Nothing threatens
her: she is afraid of nobody: it is only a case of a conscience
inexplicably and suddenly, after seven months' rest, aroused!
And what about? Nothing: absolutely nothing at all. She
had married for money, married out of pique, and then hat
arrived at loving and honouring her husband. There is some-
thing in the part akin to that of Mrs. Afildmai; in Still
Waters run Deep, but Sir Harry is no counterpart of the
sensible bourgeois husband in that play, while Jack Kennerley
is a colourless and insipid kind of intending seducer of a very
ordinary type. This dull, gay young dog, with a criminal pas-
sion for Mabel, is a difficult part thoroughly well played by Mr
GRAHAM BROWNE, with the one exception of his final scene with
Af abel. Even in the best-built house, where the ears of the walls
may be stuffed with tapestry, the loud tones of an impetuous
lover would penetrate into the study, dining-room, and kitchen
When he was uttering his sentiments to Mabel, stentorianly pas-
sionate with loving or with bitter reproaches, everyone interestei
n the scene must have trembled lest a servant should suddenly
nter to artfully inquire " Did you ring, my lady?" or lest Sir
larry should unexpectedly dash in to see what on earth could
>e the matter.
Miss LE TBIERE as Lady Milanor, Sir Harry's mother, gives us
broadly-drawn highly-coloured picture of a made-up old
woman of the world, not intended for a grande dame.
Mr. ESMOND'S people, with the exception of three principals,
are all stage puppets, including Mrs. Buckley Western's two
children, Master VVVIAN THOMAS, and Miss PHYLLIS DARE,
who do most conscientiously what they have been mistakenly
.aught, but as their presence in no way strengthens the piece,
t would have been more satisfactory to the audience, and
ess risky to success, had this little couple been as invisible as
are the fairies about whom Mr. ESMOND has made them chatter
with such irritating affectation.
A beautiful scene this woodland one, painted by W. HANN, as
jerfect a sylvan picture as could be seen on any stage. This
:an't be " the Wilderness." It is not so named in the playbill.
Is " the Wilderness" the tea-shop, or is it London ?" Out of
the Wilderness," says Sir Harry, "into the sunshine." Mabel
asks him, as an afterthought, whathe means by this expression.
Bis answer did not clear up the mystery.
What had the author, who has done far better work than
;his, in his head when he called this play " the Wilderness?"
On the other hand, "Why not?" Quite so. We'll let it rest
at that, and as Sam Weller replied to Mr. Tuckle, "We shall
get on by degrees, I des-say. We '11 try a better one, by-
and-bye."

CUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE Army Act provides that an officer thinking himself
wronged by his Commanding Officer, may carry his grievance
direct to the foot of the Throne. General Sir HENRY COLVILE,
precluded by technical difficulties from taking that course, ap-
peals to the British public. His statement takes the shape of a
record of The Work of the Ninth Division (EDWARD ARNOLD).
The plain, straight-forward narrative, illustrated by maps and
plans, makes clear the intricate story of Sannah's Post and Lind-
ley. He states his case with a manly reserve not less valorous
than his bearing on the battle-field. He indulges in no violent
diatribes, makes no accusations, arrays his facts with soldierly
brevity and precision, and leaves the jury of the world to decide
between him and the Prosecutor-judge at the War Office. There
may be differences of opinion among military critics (enjoying
the advantage of coming to judgment after the event), whether
General COLVILE did or omitted to do the right thing at the
critical moment at Lindley and Sannah's Post. My Baronite
believes there will be no difference of opinion on the assertion
that if in their dealings with the Commander of the Ninth Division
the authorities at the War Office were right, they were un-
commonly unfortunate iu the direction taken to reach the
right.
The Baron hopes that The Private Life of the King, by One of
His Majesty's Servants (PEARSON), will not be brought under His
MAJESTY'S notice as, the KINO'S sense of humour being peculiarly
keen, the effect on His MAJESTY might be serious. Would that
Mr. Punch had a WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY to review
this work, which he-would probably pronounce to be "beyond
criticism" and though, perhaps, "beyond" may not be pre-
cisely the word, yet it expresses the idea. To say that it is
"above criticism" would not be in accordance with fact. It
would be an illustration of " Le Rol s'amuse " were His MAJESTY
to give a few minutes to this work by " One of His Majesty's
Servants." As to the photographic portraits, probably Mr.
DOWNEY would be the best judge of the justice done to his
handiwork; and if he be pleased, then "Box and Co* are
satisfied," and so, of course, is the Baron.
My Son Richard (HUTCHiNSOX) is truly described as a romance
of the river. The river is the Thames, and for the scene of his
story, Mr. DOUGLAS SLADEN has chosen the lovely reach lying
between Maidenhead a'nd Marlow. He knows and loves every
furlong of it, and is happily gifted with the power of communi-
cating to others his pleasure in contemplating it. He peoples
its banks and its boats with pleasant folk, who live ordinary
holiday life, fishing, flirting, punting and rowing. It makes a
pretty pastoral picture, pleasant for the study of those who
have time and opportunity to get on the river, perhaps even
more so to those, like my Baronite, whose chief boating
experience is pulling the galley oar in town. Tho story
is brought up to date by news of the outbreak of the war in
South Africa, and the patriotic but inconvenient desire of
My Son Bidutrd, and others of the company, to imitate MAL-
BROOK, Qu'il s'eii va't en guerre,
Buy and "Sell." Useful and entertaining for all those who
are blessed, or otherwise, with the journalistic faculty is the
large volume entitled Hell's World's Press, with its artistically
got up supplement, containing portraits of such a number of
what a fortune-telling gipsy might term "pretty gentlemen."
In connection with the name of "Sell," it is a good thing
to be taken in. But in spite of the name the information, to
judge of it lit a glance, is ample and accurate in the opinion
of the careful BARON DE B.-W.

TO A PIGEON OF "LA PIAZZA."
BIHD of the beady eye and tireless crop,
Capacious past the common pigeon's use,
Brave, neck and breast, with bloom of green and purple,
A rounded Iris answering the sun,
But suited for the rest in sober grey,
Mating the dusky gleam of Moorish domes,
And sombre-hued against the gilt and glare
Of bastard Byzantine, restored "to taste"—
I like you, bird ; the gondolas and you
Would seem the only ancient things in Venice,
"Which -we may hope to understand -without
The help of Mr. RUSKIN. Let me buy
One little paper bag of yellow maize,
Dear at a soldo, and I '11 undertake,
"Waiving the Master's aid, to win your love
As perfectly as though I had by heart
The inwardness of all the Middle Ages.
I say, I like you, bird ; you have a soul
Unseared by culture ; you will roost o' nights
Indifferently on a marble niche
Flanking the dim mosaic's awful marge,
Or up a rain-spout; on the Doges' Palace,
Or QUADRI's restaurant; you throw your eye
"With equal and dispassionate regard
Upon the untutored Briton who aspires
Not far beyond the sudden Kodak's film,
And on the fair Bostonian rapt with awe,
Her Stones of Venice tucked beneath her arm,
Her visage wan with having drunk too well
The borrowed sweets of that laborious bee,

Although LA DISK passes, deadly bored
"With playing in her hero's Cittd Morta;
Nay, should the hero's self, Italia's pride,

Consent to prance across the dazzled square,
Recalling memories of the Golden Time,
You would not turn to stare as others turn,
Quite rudely; what's D'ANNUNZIO to you,
Unless his largesse leaves you plump with grain?
And even so the studied attitude
Will certainly escape you. I respect
Your disregard of persons. I admire
With what aloofness you ignore the crowd,
Going about your private loves and^hates
As though the public counted not at all,
Save as a menace to your fragile toes
And as a source of food. It is an art,
This unselfconsciousness, which we have lost,
Like that of wearing wings. You keep them both.
What brought you here, I wonder, at the first,
Before the hucksters spread their toothsome wares
Within the very temple's outer courts?
Doubtless the prose accounts are always best;
Yet, were I poet, I would dare to say
Here, too, was instinct, Nature's work by which
Beauty is drawn to beauty, like to like,
Not knowing wherefore. So, by such a spell,
I will believe that in the Time-old tale,
The Cytherean doves, they knew not why,
Hovered about the gracious ways of her,
That other Aphrodite of the Sea.

THE NEW "FRONDE.'
ACCORDING to the Westminster Gazette an effort is being made
to establish a daily paper in London which shall be the pro-
duction of women for women in every particular. Sporting
news will be done by women as well as politics, Parliament,
&c." Nothing if not up-to-date, Mr. Punch offers an
intelligent anticipation" of the first number:—
POLITICS.
(By our Special Parliamentary Representative.)
A very dull sitting, which would have been quite uneventful
but for the appearance of the beautiful Mrs. HADDON HAIX, who
lightened the gloom of the ladies' gallery by a charming con-
fection of fawn glace. She wore a coat of Directoire shape,
the smart little basque being cut away at the sides. The revers
and cuffs were faced with silk and trimmed with gold braid,
while the waistcoat was of Pompadour silk box-pleated, and the
lace frills that fell over her hands matched the lace of the
jabot. And here let me protest once more against the wicked
iniquity of allowing ladies to be "cabined, cribbed, confined"
in that abominable black hole behind the grille, where the
choicest toilette of Paris sheds its lustre in vain. In spite of
good eye-sight and the best opera glasses, I was quite unable
to detect the material of Mrs. HADDON HALL'S underskirt.
Miss , of the Woman's Suffrage League, was busy lobby-
ing, as usual, gowned in hep customary severe simplicity. I
noticed that several Members have taken to summer wear.
Mr. W-NST-N CH-RCH-LL, in particular, looked well in a new
frock-coat, while Mr. B-RNS was democratic in a bowler.
SPORT.
The cricket tournament at Lord's yesterday proved very
interesting. JONES, the fast bowler, opened with a tremendous
service to BROWN, who, however, returned the leather, slogging
it right out of court.
Nothing daunted, JONES returned to the attack, but BROWN
defended his uprights, half-volleying the service. At the third
ball he was narrowly missed by the stump-keeper, who, how-
ever, failed to hold the pilule and passed to longstop, who
neatly returned it to JONES. After the fifth ball the umpire called
"Overli" but the match was not ended yet. JONES was exhausted
by his tremendous efforts, and the service was taken up by
SMITH from the other end of the court. SMITH'S service seemed
to be very deadly, pitching just on the service-line with a
nasty twist in towards the goal-posts, and it evidently
puzzled the batsman, whose score remained steadily at love.
At length, growing desperate, he ran in to the globe and
volleyed it right into SMITH'S hands, who held the sphere amid
loud applause. By this time SMITH was out of breath, but JUNES
having recovered resumed the service, and another batsmau
coming in, play continued until lunch time, when who should
I see crossing the court but CHARLIE, who is playing for the
M.C.C. and looked delicious in flannels. He was as surprised to
see me as I to set eyes on him, and would hardly believe it
when I said I was there to report the match for the new paper.
He asked me to lunch with him, and being very hungry and
tired, I was delighted; and after lunch he offered to overhaul
my copy; and that, perhaps, is why I have been able to give
such a minute and technical account of the match.
THE MONEY MARKET.
Kain falling heavily in the morning, the market was dull,
though umbrellas went up and there was a run on waterproofs.
At this season of the year, a safe investment is a bolero.
During the recent cold weather there was a perceptible rise in
furs, the bears having it all their own way. Muslins were
sensitive, but have now recovered and will probably remain
steady for some time, but owing to the continuous east winds,
transparent collars are still at a discount.

USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL.
WHAT startling post-cards for Home and Abroad distribution
have been recently brought out by Messrs. R. TUCK & SONS
under the style and title of "The Heraldic Series," displaying
the arms, hands, legs, feet and mot-toes of most of the principal
towns in United Kingdom! They might have been invented
by a modern Mr. Peter Magnus, who, following in the steps
of his Pickwickian prototype, finds that some trifling pictorial
novelty on a post-card has the same effect on the recipients
as had those "hasty notes to intimate acquaintance," with
"afternoon" signed on them instead of "P.M.," which
was, in Mr. PICKWICK'S opinion, a performance "calculated to
afford them (Mr. Magnus's friends) the highest gratification."
Exeter is represented by "Three Castles" and "a Cow."
Why? "Three Castles" is the celebrated Virginian tobacco
praised by THACKERAY; while a " Cow" is associated with the
"three acres" once so familiar to the ears of political
supporters. But what has Exeter specially to do with these
things? Cheltenham is represented by a rook, two books, a
couple of gulls, and (apparently) a cauliflower rampant. Again,
why? The meaning of the Harrogate motto is more evident,
"Aivc Celebris Jontibus," clearly "Arx (i.e. 'ask') for the
celebrated waters." The armorial bearings of Birmingham have
nothing of Brummagem about them. On the left of a shield (one
of the South Shields, perhaps) is a languishing lady, with
palette and brushes; clearly "Art," and as she is tall she
represents "High Art." On the right is a Smith (" heard that
name before"), with a hammer resting on an anvil, while in
the centre above the shield is a castellated crown, out of which
has arisen a muscular arm with hand grasping a battle-axe that
is about to descend sharply on the idle blacksmith's head, just
by way of reminder that he must get on with his work. The
motto is an excellent one, " Forward," which, of course, is not
intended to be applicable to the very modest and retiring
female artist already mentioned, while the arm with battle-axe
is evidently to suggest how unpleasant for the workmen would
be the effects of a strike.
We regret not having at our disposal more leisure for the
deciphering of these arms and mottoes, "the bearings" of
which lie "in the application on 'em." Anyway, the idea is
novel, and will induce many, who have nothing particular to
say, to send some of these cards as puzzles to friends in any
part of the United Kingdom.
ONE REASON FOR TAXING SUGAR.
THE bitter-sweet in Life how intertwined,
Coraingled and compounded! Where the mind
That could the dual properties dissever?
Ah! no, they will be separated never.
The Government so deep read in the laws
Nature imposes for the common cause,
Has long taxed bitter. What could be more meet
Than that it now should wish to tax the suvet?
PEOPLE WHO PALL ON ME.
II.—THE MAN WHO is ALWAYS "TIP-TOP."
GOOD health is a bright jewel, someone with a penchant for
copybook maxims has said. Doubtless; at the same time it's
bad form to be over-dressed with any kind of ornament, and
there are some people whose ostentatious good health is very
exasperating. ROUSER, for instance, falls into this category.
He 's not content to be healthy in a gentlemanly, un- assuming
way; it makes him positively aggressive.
"What," shouts ROUSER (he never talks, and no tradition
exists of his ever having whispered), "not feeling quit* up to
the mark, aren't you? Eh? These east winds! Pooh, man.
Why, I'm tip-top—absolutely. What i/ou want is a five-mile
walk before breakfast. Then you 'd be as fit as a fiddle."
I think of mentioning that there are fiddles and fiddles, but
it's of little use replying to ROUSER. So I smile sceptically
and change the subject, though the latter is a difficult thing to
accomplish. Odd thing that such men imagine rude health
necessarily connotes rude manners: Men like Roi'SKR always
mistake good health for a moral quality.
"I thank my stars 1 never get influenza," he is always
exclaiming during the winter and spring months, suggesting
by his tone that there has been some special dispensation of
Providence on his behalf.
1 dislike a man who is always telling me what he thinks
I want. ROL'SER's a distinct failure as a thought-reader.
Then, again, just because an early breakfast doesn't disagree
with him, he chucks (that 's the only word which describes it)
this early breakfast at all his less obviously robust friends. I
say "less obviously robust" advisedly, for I believe many of
us are quite as healthy, though not so ostentatiously healthy,
as ROUSER.
"Look here, ROUSER!" I've said to him. "If an early
breakfast suits you, then take it—But for goodness sake take
it secretly, and make no public mention of such an unholy
performance: else may the ghost of BLIA haunt you."
But perhaps this is scarcely kind to the ghost of KLIA.
No doubt the day will come when the chastening influence
of a chill will descend on ROUSER. To every man there comes,
at some time, the opportunity to reform. And when that much
to be desired event arrives, ROUSER, I am sure, will rise from
his bed a quieter and more tolerable companion.

"SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT";
Or, the Coming Eclipse—of the Honeymoon.
[" That the modern bride cannot endure the sole
companionship of her husband for even the first
few days of married life, and that Benedick must
have golfing or playhouses, or the society of friends,
lest he should be bored by the woman he has just
taken as a life-companion, is truly a pitiful exposure
of the spirit in which the holy estate is entered
upon by the present generation."—Lady's Pictorial. ]
Being a " Love-letter " from a Bride to an
Intimate Friend.
MY DEAREST INA,—When GEORGE and I
left good old Hill Street for Charing Cross
in his motor-car, I experienced the most
awful feelings of loneliness. So did
GEORGE. So silly, when we had arranged
to be sensible and make the honeymoon a
matter of mere traditional interest.
GEORGE'S own words. I never realized
what strangers we are until we were tuff-
tuffing across Berkeley Square in a kind
of misty matrimonial gloom. I wished,
dear, I knew him better. You see, I saw
so little of him when we were engaged,
and now that we are married I expect my
chances of knowing him are altogether
gone. We shall be like " ships that pass
in the night," you knowr. I actually felt
nonplussed as to what to talk about. I
knew his five golf stories (including the
swear words), and he has made himself
thoroughly familiar with my remarks on
the weather. So, you see, wo were at a
complete standstill. Fortunately, we
were not long left in this awful predica-
ment, for the motor went wrong (good old
GEORGE !), and we arranged that I should
get out and take a cab, while GEORGE and
his man should push the car to the station
or die in the attempt. Quite a will of his
own, hasn't he? By-the-bye, dearest, his
moustache is brown. You were right,
after all. I always thought it was black;
but, of course, you know him so much
better than I do.
Thank goodness, there was a crowd to
meet us at Charing Cross. All the PETER-
SHAWLS and that set. CHARLEY was so
amusing, and travelled down with us to
Dover. Wasn't it a relief, dear? GEORGE
studied Ruff's Guide until he fell asleep,
and CHARLEY and I played piquet. We
went to the "Warden," and GEORGE per-
suaded CHARLEY to come too. The FOWLER-
GRANTS met us at the hotel, for, as I think
I told you, they had arranged a little
dance in our honour. Though rather
fagged with the ceremony and the hurry
and bustle, I managed to get the best out
of an average evening. Do you know,
darling, GKORGE doesn't dance, and posi-
tively refused to be bored to death at the
FOWLER-GRANTS (rather small house), so
he and CHARLEY made the night hideous
in the billiard-room. Mrs. F. G. was rather
surprised at my going alone. Such an old-
fashioned thing. I told her now-a-days a
husband was an institution like the Tower

Amateur Gardener (to goat-fancying neighbour). "Hi, MADAM! ON« OF TOUK CONFOUNDED
PITH HAS GOT INTO MY OARDKN, AND IS EATING MY BIDDIK G-PLANTS!"
Neighbour. "GOOD GRACIOUS! / TKUST THEY ARK WOT POISONOUS!"
or the National Gallery. So accessible,
dear, that you never go near them. She
was—or pretended to be—a little shocked.
I thought it was not bad for me.
We went on board one of those awful
boats the next day in a drizzle. Not a soul
on board we knew. I never realized what
a really nice boy CHARLEY P. was until I
saw him fading away in a Dover fly on his
way to the station. Could anything be
more awful, dear, more hopelessly depres-
sing than to be alone on a tossing little
tub with one's own husband? We were a
most deplorable looking couple when we
reached Calais. Here, I am thankful to
say, the LEPIZONS met us as arranged.
GEORGE was awfully bad-tempered. I can't
think what annoyed him. Perhaps I bored
him ; perhaps he saw how successfully he
bored me. At any rate, we decided (of
course, quite nicely) that as ho was sick
of Paris, he might as well return at once
to England, when he thought he would be
in time for the golf competition. He is so
delightfully mad on golf, dear. Of course,
it would be awfully dull for him here. Wo
are going to do all the theatres next week
and perhaps some of the music-halls, dar-
ling! Then we shall go on to Nice. I
shall try and persuade GEORGE to come on
there. He can golf all day, and play bridge
with Col. WEYBRIDGE and the LEPIZONS in
the evening.
If GEORGE decides to go straight homo
after Hoylake, we shall prolong our stay
here. It will be an immense relief, dear,
to know that he is perfectly happy in his
dear, silly old way. And when we meet
again the atmosphere of sickly sentiment
will have cleared. One hopes so!
Ever yours devotedly,
SELIN'A TlUIMAN.

"SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE."
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—No doubt yon have
seen in the papers a long correspondence
about " The Poor Lady." Several philan-
thropists have shown how an impoverished
gentlewoman can live, upon next to no-
thing a year with the assistance of various
residential homes. But if there are poor
ladies, are there not " mere men " equally
requiring the aid of the charita.bly inclined?
Take myself, for example. I dress fairly
(thanks to the indulgence of my trades-
people), and occasionally am able to take
the house dinner at my club. But I am
terribly pressed, and even regard an
omnibus as an impossible luxury. I re-
member, years ago, one of the most cele-
brated of the contributors to your im-
mortal pages suggested that there was an
opening for poor gentlemen in "salad dres-
sing." The scheme was proposed i n a work
entitled, as I think, Happy Thotiylit Hall,
and "the Confraternity" was to be
styled " The Little Brothers of the Rich."
Presentable young men were to dine at a
moment's notice, like "the Man from
Blank-ley's."
Surely the admirable notion should have
been followed up. I shall be only too
pleased to start it, going myself to the
first entertainment demanding my ser-
vices. 1 can listen to bores with so much
attention that I can put in at the appro-
priate moments either smiles or tears. I
can cheer heartily an amateur's comic
song, and, what is even more important,
can keep perfectly grave while a non-
professional prima donna is"singing in a
whisper out of time. Surelyisuch talents
as mine should be turned to good account.
Yours truly, "A POOR MAN."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY or TOBY, H.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 18.—
GEORGE WYSDHAM, banging door of Irish
Office behind him, gaily returned to \Var
Office affairs. For the moment quite a
different man. Been Irish Secretary only
a few months; already work beginning to
tell upon him. It broke FORSTER's stout
heart; it turned GEORGE TREVELYAN'S
hair prematurely grey. Compared with
their times of turmoil, CHIEF SECRETARY
of to-day has quite a pleasant place; but
already streaks of white are showing in
his abundant hair. Something of the
native joyousness of his manner has faded;
he is acquiring an artificial sing-song
intonation of sentences that tends to spoil
his speech. For one night only he returns
to the War Office, to help BRODRICK in
defending his scheme. This he triumph-
antly does on quite new and conclusive
ground.
"If," he asked, " we reject this scheme,
what are we going to do with the Generals
and Staff Officers now at the front?"
There's the thing in a nut-shell. Thirty-
two millions to be voted for the Army.
'' Why ?'' asks the over-burdened taxpayer.
"Why?" repeats WYNDHAM, sharply.
"Because we 've got to find something to
do for our Generals and Staff Officers who
will be out of work when the war is over
in South Africa."
Next to this disclosure, C.-B.'s shrewd
discovery of weak point of the whole
scheme was a secondary sensation. "You
ask for six Army Corps, three to be ready
for active service abroad. Very well. If
three out of the six go, there won't be
six left."
For a moment the House stood at gaze
like JOSHUA'S sun at Ajalon. BRODKICK
moved uneasily on the Treasury Bench.
PRINCE fARTHUR pretended to be deeply
engaged with his despatch box. WALDRON
standing at the Bar, looking round to see
that his men were well in hand, felt that
if a division were forthwith taken it would
go hard with the Government. The pause
broken by ripple of laughter. Deepened
into a roar. C.-B., resuming his seat,
looked round and smiled in genial response.
All very well to take it that way. An
old device to laugh at unpleasant incon-
trovertible fact; but can C.-B.'s proposi-
tion be denied? Can anyone put his
hand upon his heart and say that if three
of the six Army Corps go abroad, there
will be six left at home? I trow not.
Then where are we? Admitting this flaw
in the scheme, is it worth while to spend
thirty millions in order to find occupa-
tion and income for discharged Generals
and disendowed Staff Officers?
Tried to catch SPEAKER'S eye; would
like to have put these points, which flash
upon one's mind as result of exhilarating
intellectual activity born of listening to
Debate. As usual, SPEAKER didn't see
me.
Business done. — Debatiug new War
Office scheme.
House of Lords, Tuesday night.— The
MARKISS back again after brief holiday.
Everyone glad to flnd him in bounding
health and (consequently) in most para-
doxical mood. Inclined to hit out all
round, contradicting everyone. The first
body on which his heavy hand fell was the
blameless one that homes the meek spirit
of HENEAGE. Never so surprised in liis

"I am not sure that I do not think it something

that our preparations have not been sufficiently
thought out to make our position as secure as we
could wish to be !"—Lord Salisbury's Speech at
the Hotel Metropole.
life. For startled moment thought he
was back again in educational establish-
ment in Yorkshire where, whilst he was
still with us in the Commons, fantastic
fancy feigned knowledge of his early and
unhappy sojourn.
Question before House was Second
Reading of Licensing Boards Bill, moved
by CAMPERDOWN. All HENEAGE did was to
invite the Government to fulfil their
promise set forth in KINO'S Speech to
bring in Bill dealing with Licensing
Question.
"Don't," he said, "try to get out of
the position by inviting individual Mem-
bers of the House to intrcduec Bills."
The MARKISS up like a young thing of
twenty. "I -wish," he said, severely
regarding HENEAGE as if he were a house-
maid discovered taking a chair in the
drawing-room at Hatfleld, "to correct
•what the noble Lord has said, that I asked
private Members to bring in Bills. I do
not remember ever having made so indis-
creet a request."
HENEAGE, trembling in every limb, his
pallid brow beaded with perspiration,
meekly reminded the MAHKISS that when
BISHOP OF WINCHESTER brought before the
House Resolution on the subject he, the
MARKISS, peremptorily ordered him to
take it away and bring in a Bill.
"That's a very different matter," said
the MARKISS; "but to exhort private
Members generally to bring in Bills is an
amount of indiscretion of which I have
not been guilty."
And of which no one had accused him.
Later, ROSEBERY in masterly process of
cross-examination pitilessly plied the
MARKISS with questions on the subject of
Ministerial intention. If the subject of
the ordeal had been any other—say Mrs.
DANE on her Defence—he would'have been
brought to his knees. The MARKISS only
contradicted ROSEBERY and himself, and
in the end there remained unravelled
the mystery that broods about Govern-
ment Licensing Bill promised in KING'S
Speech.
Business done.—Commons still discus-
sing Army scheme put forward by War
Office. Hostile criticism renewed from
both sides. SARK says it reminds him of
CHARLES I. riding through the streets of
the town after the Battle of Naseby
"There was none to cry God bless
him!"
House of Commons, Tliumdaij Night.—
Nineteen years has Mr. SAM. SMITH
dwelt in the wilderness of the House
of Commons, and its ways are still
dark to him. Just now, called on by
the SPEAKER, he rose to put a question
concerning the welfare of the London
barmaid. Why should Members burst
into roar of cheers, turning to a shout of
laughter as he meekly surveyed the
scene? Difficult for him to understand
why in any circumstances grown-up men
should laugh. The present lapse into
temporary insanity quite inexplicable.
'Twas ever thus. Whatever be the subject
he takes in hand—the purlieus, of the
theatres, the back of the stage at the
music-halls, the iniquity of certain plays,
Piccadilly Circus after midnight — no
sooner is his plaintive voice heard asking
a question or driving home a moral than
ribald Members opposite, others below
the Gangway on his own side, break forth
into a cheer of suspicious vigour.
Of course, there is not a scintilla of
truth in the story told in the smoking-
room, that SAMUEL crossed Palace Yard

buxom barmaid on either arm. If it were
true, why not'! A common thing for
Members about to address the house to
escort lady friends to the Gallery. Why
should S. S., intent upon pleading the
cause of the over-worked barmaid be
deprived of the society of acquaintances
especially interested in the subject of
his remarks.
It wasn't true; the House knew it was
a weak invention; but it laughed, all the
same, what time SAMUEL in mild amaze
awaited an interval of silence in which he
might put his Question.
Business done.—BRODRlCK's resolution
on Army Reform carried by majority of
142 in the House of 468. Members
wouldn't speak in favour of it; but they
voted; which, on the whole, PRINCE
ARTHUR, a little anxious about the re-
sult, thinks is the better way.
Friday.—WINSTON CHURCHILL came very
well out of critical ordeal of second
important speech. With the modesty of
youth ho undertook to challenge the
scheme of Army Re-organization put for-
ward from War Office. Handed in amend-
ment to BRODRICK'S resolution, which,
if carried, would not only have involved
withdrawal of elaborate scheme but re-
signation of the Ministry. C.-B. moving
more leisurely, as is the way with
heavier bodies, some time later placed
on Paper amendment designed to have
identical effect. WINSTON must needs
give way to Leader of Opposition; but
no reason why he shouldn't have his
say.
With characteristic good luck, found
an opening at eleven o'clock. No
better time for making a hit. Members
back again in their places in cheerful
frame of mind engendered by dinner.
WINSTON'S speech evidently carefully
prepared, but wasn't embarrassed by his
notes; turned aside from them now and
then to make capital debating point out
of speeches delivered earlier in the
evening. Much in matter and manner of
speech that recalled his father. To be-
gin with, had thoroughly studied the
subject, and had something practical to
say about it; his darts winged with
admirably-phrased, sometimes epigram-
matic sentences. SARK complains that
his utterance is too rapid, and hopes he
won't make fatal mistake of speaking too
often. But he '11 learn, and lie 'II do.

THE SOLDIER'S PROGRESS.
(Modern Version.)
[" Means must be found either to put a atop to
the social and other expenses connected with com-
mands in the Army, which demand private expen-
diture, or to raise the pay to the level of the
expenses."—Times, May 15. J
WELLINGTON MARLBOROUGH SMITH made
up his mind at the early age of five that
ne would be worthy of his Christian names.
By saving up his pocket-money, and
turning it over" by the purchase arid
sale of various articles greatly prized by
lis school-fellows, he realised a sum that
assisted his parents to obtain for him the
supplementary education qualifying him
tor the Service.
He was gazetted a second lieutenant.
Then it came to pass that he found he had
an insufficient income to live up to hisrank.
So he invented and patented a new sort
of corkscrew, and realised a considerable-
sum. This kept him going until he secured
his "star."
And now he had to qualify for his
company. He took to betting, and with
the aid of good luck, again was in sufficient
funds. He became a captain, and was
ready to receive field rank.
He faced the financial difficulty, and,
with the assistance of the Stock Ex-
change, obtained sufficient cash to keep
up his position. Captain, and subse-
quently Major, W. M. SMITH prospered.
A small war in a distant part of His
Majesty's possessions secured for him
valuable service and no less valuable
exemption from entertaining.
He was worthy of his name, and returned
home Major-General Sir WELLINGTON M.
SMITH, K.C.B.
He was called to Pall Mall and offered
the command of a district.
He hesitated. He was urged to accept
the appointment.
"You deserve it, Sir WELLINGTON,"
said the official. "Your services have
been meritorious, and the Army wil;
receive our choice with acclamation."
"You are most kind," returned Sii
WELLINGTON, "but there is an insuperable
difficulty. 1 am not a rich man."
The official received the announcement
with grave regret.
"Well," said he at last, " we will keei,
it open for six weeks. By the end of thai
time you will be able to see if you can do
anything."
The period passed rapidly. At its enc
Sir WELLINGTON presented himself once
more at Pall Mall.
"I am delighted, Sir, to accept the
command you have so kindly suggested.'
The official shook the distinguishe<
officer by the hand. They had been
school-fellows in the days when they were
boys together.
"I say, old man," said the civilian
dropping the official tone as the matte:

ANYHOW, SINCERE.
Reggie (who prides himself on his vrit). "I BAY, CHA.KLIE, YOU am MY JOKE, DON'T YOP,
OLD CHAP? VRRY GOOD, ISN'T IT?"
Charlie (who considers himself a wag). "NoT AT ALL, OLD FELLOW. DON'T BKJC IT, AND
DON'T WANT TO SBI IT. HAVB BSARD IT, AND THAT'S QUITE INOUOH FOR us!"
[Conversation ends abruptlu.
was settled, "how did you get over the
financial difficulty? Peg tops and knives
played out?"
"Quite—fifty years ago."
"And T suppose not much left of the
patent corkscrew?"
"Self-opening bottles disposed of that."
"Anything on race meetings or the
Stock Exchange?"
"Haven't time for either."
"Then how on earth did you obtain a
sufficient private income to keep up the
command?"
"I am married," returned the warrior,
"and the maiden name of my wife was
EUPHINA X. Y. Z. O'DoiXARS, of Chicago,
U.S.A. My father-in-law—who is known
as the Pork King—behaved like a million-
aire and a gentleman." And shaking
hands with his old school-fellow, the Gene-
ral Commanding the District hastened
to Head-quarters to show himself at a
garden fete, plus a dinner-party and a
flve-hundred-guosts-iuvited dance.
AT EARL'S COURT-AN APPRECIATION.
SOMETHING like a Military Exhibition!
Big guns defending the band-stand, big
guns protecting the refreshment depart-
ment, big guns dominating the principal
stalls and threatening the gigantic
wheel. And a very splendid spectacle,
"China," takes one to Pekin. According
to the book, historically correct.
Then the military relics are deeply
interesting. WELLINGTON'S cloak at Water-
loo quite worth of itself the charge
of one shilling which admits the visitor
to the whole show—the whole show (well
understood), with two or three exceptions.
The military pictures, too, first rate. A
portrait of the late ARCHIBALD FORBES (to
whose memory knights of the pen and
sword are erecting a monument in St.
Paul's), capital. Quite one of the best of
Professor VON HERKOMER. Altogether,
well worth seeing. It was said years ago
that all roads led to Earl's Court. Those
roads this year should bo well travelled.

OCCASIONAL NOTES AT THE OPERA.
Monday, May 18.—To the Opera, with a Covent-
Gardenia as a button-hole in honour Of first night
of season. Merry month of May, musical May,
season for pipe and tabor. Couldn't get very far
now-a-days with orchestra limited to pipe and
tabor. New arrangements outside, inside, on the
stage, under the stage, above the stage—whether
for better or worse time will show. At entrance
in Bow Street, carriages drive up where cabs fear to come;
and outside-the portico under an awning (which wasn't there
on the first night, but has since been fixed up) the cabs drive
up. This promises, by the aid of well-managed "call-boys,"
to be a considerable improvement on the old rough-and-tumble
fashion of cgresaing. The awning is not big enough by at least
a third. And is it rain-proof?
By the new arrangement of entrance to stalls right and left
of orchestra, whence the stall-occupants come up de profundis,
the lounge entr'acte, whereof the lorgnetters were wont to block
the passage, is now a thing of the past. By this move the
syndicate gains two private boxes. There is nothing very
novel in the scenic arrangements. The hideous old-fashioned
prompt-box, like the top part of a small hansom cab, is at a
greater distance from the "flote,"—no longer to be called
"flote" as the lights are "sunk,"—and the conductor of the
orchestra seems to be raised on a higher rock than ever above
the submerged musicians.
As to performance. Well, chorus good; "cloister " and " ball-
room" scene ditto in Goi'NOD's Romeo et Juliette, given in French-
Grand ovation to Madame EAMBS as the melodious heroine, who
would not take an encore for the waltz which she sang
deliciously. With her, one good turn does not deserve another.
As Romeo, Mons. SALEZA in excellent voice: nice little man
for BO fine a Juliette. The evergreen BAUERMEISTER-singer,
quite a coquettish Gertrude, alias Shakspearian "nurse to
Juliette." Mons. JOURNET not quite the worthy Frere iaiirent.
Signer MANCINELLI in great force, conducting himself and
orchestra admirably.
Of course, punctually at eight the National Anthem was
given as a sort of perfunctory tribute to the Opera House as
bearing the affix of "Royal." It rather recalls the Non Nobis
at a City dinner, so delightfully described by THACKERAY as
"sung by those professional devotees, Mr. SHADRACK, Mr.
MESHECH, and little JACK OLDBOY." This devotional dedication
of the season was lost on the fashionable majority in boxes and
stalls, their occupants not arriving in time to demonstrate their
undoubted loyalty.
Among the celebrities present we observed Prince and
Princess PING-PONG, the Marquis of LAWN-TENNIS, Count CRO-
QUET, and Baron BRIDGE. Wiscount WHIST, of Whisteria, we
regret to say, was unable to put in an appearance. UNLIMITED
Loo, sparkling in diamonds, was very much en Evidence, as were
Baroness BACCARAT, Captain CRIBBAGE, and GREGORY GOLF.
Not" all the ' talents ' " present but a fair average of "shekels."
Tuesday, May 14, at 7.45, HUMPERDINCK'S opera of Hansel und
Qretel in German. This being a "juvenile night,"—that is, as
far as the first part is concerned, the second division, Caviillcria
Rusticann (in Italian), being for those who have passed from the
years of discretion into those of indiscretion,—a juvenile critic
was evidently the one to give an unsophisticated opinion, and
this very "young person" was simply delighted with the
Gretel of Fraulein DAVID and the Hansel of Franlein FELSER,
who really seemed to make themselves quite little children.
Oh! how they did act and sing! Full of spirit and "go."
"Go" is the word.
"The prayer," observed our youthful critic, attempting the
professionally descriptive style, "before the children prepare
for sleep, was most beautifully rendered by these very clever
(with an accent on the 'very') young ladies." "They
received," continues our ecstatic reporter, "many 'calls' at
the end of the delightful opera." And did "they come when
they were called"? "Rather.' And," adds my enthusiastic
deponent, "they thoroughly deserved it, for they had worked
ADMIRABLY!!!" Italics and notes of admiration can no
further go.
Miss ALDRIDGE with the powerful voice was a splendid
witch, and Mile. OLITZKA as Gertrude very good. As the
drunken old Eccles-like but good-hearted father Peter, Herr
MTHLMANN, though a name that sounds like a man who makes
a mull of it, was excellent. Specially to be noted as being
particularly effective were the two solos of the Sandman and
the Dewman, sung by Madame KIRKBY LIJNN (pity her
Christian name isn't "SARAH "—as for this children's opera a
"Sally Lunn" would have been so suggestive of nursery tea
time!) and by Miss NlCHOLLS. Mistake to give Cavalleria
after this; and so late too! Was it in order to balance the
comedy of Hansel und Oretel against the tragedy of Cavalleriu
that the big " waits " were thrown into the scale?
Wednesday. — Tannhiinsf.r in German. Composer WAGNER,
Conductor LoHSE. Fran GADSKI at her very best as Elisabeth.
Was it Fran GADSKI who wrote The Letters of Elizabeth? The
notes of this Elisabeth are even more charming than those of
the other Elizabeth, just now so popular. Mile. STRAKOSCH not
an ideal Venus. Mynheer VAN DYCK, as the Good Knight gone
wrong, is knight errant at first, but wins reproche at finish:
quite the character. Hcrr MOHWINKEL'S Wolfram " of the very
best." Good performance. But O those weary waits between
the acts! Whose fault? A good ten minutes, or what the
French call tin petit quart d'heure, would be quite sufficient for
the most exhausted singers to rest their bodies, clear their
pipes, and, in the ancient language of "the ring," not the
Wagnerian but pugilistic, to " take a suck at the lemon and at
him again." Time! tuneful ladies and gentlemen. Time!
Thursday.—Re-appearance of our old friend Bigoletto. Viva
VERDI! Show me a better aiiin than Black-eyed SUSAN ADAMS,
and if that be possible, then do I defy you to produce a better
Duke, a Duke younger and more tender, a lighter Lovelace and
gayer Lothario combined, a Duke not yet old enough or politic
enough to assume the virtue of a Ducal bearing in public
though he hath it not in private,—in fact, show me a more
captivating young dog of a Duke, a more charming singer and
more careless sinner than is ANSELMI as II Duca, and—well—
the reward will be given in " untold gold "!
That excellent artist, M.GlLLiBEKT was a dignified representa-
tive of the unfortunate Montcrone, whose terrific " cuss " is
the cause of all the woe. M. SEVEILHAC was about as good a
Rigolleto as is within the memory of opera-goers more youthful
than those who can remember RONCONI: but RONCONI was
nowhere vocally. M. SEVEILHAC, Black-eyed SUSAN, and the
Dook, were called and recalled, and recalled after that. So
Rigoletto is not played out, but like " la petit bonhomme" the
work of VERDI "uit encore." Marked curtail-
ment of entr'actes. The removal of these heavy
"waits " makes Rigoletto quite a light opera.
Friday.—"A nicht with GOUNOD; or, Faust
a la franyaise," and a Saturday WAGNER Xight,
Tristan und Isolde, bring the first week's opera
season to a satisfactory conclusion.

In the City.
Innocent Dabbler. What do they mean by Northern Pacific
Commons?
Mr. Spec (mho has not been particularly fortunate). I should
call them the North Pacific Uucommons, as they jump about
like kangaroos.

REGULATIONS FOR MOTOR CARS.
To encourage a rising British industry,
the following rules are suggested tor the
consideration of those County Councils
most opposed to any new vehicles.
The maximum rate of speed for any
motor-car anywhere at any time is to be
two miles an hour, with the following
exceptions:—
When-passing through any town, village,
or hamlet, or within a hundred yards of
any house, cottage or other inhabited
building, the speed is to be diminished to
one-half of the maximum rate.
When there is any cart, carriage, van,
bath-chair, perambulator or other vehicle
within, sight, the speed is to be diminished
to one quarter.
Wht-n turning any corner, the speed is
Between the hours of sunset and sun-
rise every motor-car shall carry four
powerful lamps, one at each corner.
If the driver of any cart, carriage,
van, bath-chair, perambulator, or other
vehicle, shall indicate by any signs or
words that the motor-car is likely to
alarm the horses, asses, passengers, or
other animals or persons in the vehicle,
the driver and passengers of the motor-
car shall at once alight, and lift, push,
pull, drag, or by other means remove the
motor-car behind a house, cottage, shed,
church, barn, haystack, or other screen,
until the vehicle in which are the animals
or persons alarmed has past and is at a
distance of not less than 440 yards away.
Every motor-car is to be provided with
cow, dog, or any other building, erection,
vehicle, person, or animal whatsoever,
but the bell or horn is not to be sounded
in such a manner as to cause annoyance or
alarm to or in any animal, person, vehicle,
or building.
Every motor-car is to carry at the back
a board or other erection bearing in
letters not less than one foot high the
name and address of the owner, the letters
to be black on a white ground by day,
and luminous by night.
Every driver, owner, passenger, hirer
or lessor of any motor-car infringing any
of the above regulations shall be liable to
a flue of not less than £100, and to be im-
prisoned for not less than one calendar
month with hard labour, these penalties

[May 29, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A GREAT THOUGHT FOR EveRY DAY IN THE YEAR.
SECOND SERIES.
V.—THE BERNARD SHAW SECTION.
MAY 1st.—It was never my intention that the disabilities
which hampered the many strong men who preceded AGAMEMNON
should hamper me. They were, I take it, a brainless crew,
busy with doing things instead of getting themselves talked
about. There is always a solution (which seems to have
escaped them) for the difficulty of finding a sacred bard to
record you. Be your own sacred bard.
2ND, 3Rd.—In most periods the lonely genius, who is after-
wards described as the outcome of his age, though he invariably
has to create the taste by which he is ultimately appreciated,
has been regarded, if regarded at all by his jejune contempo-
raries, as a poseur. It happens that I have been so regarded,
and rightly. Now, to correct the unhappy results of such an
impression, in itself accurate, there is one salutary antidote.
It is to pose about your pose. That is what I am doing now.
4TH, 5TH.—The middle classes, fed to suffocation on the
Romanticism of drawing-room drama and the Family Herald,
take unkindly to the social iconoclast. It is, therefore, the
business of this, the highest type of philanthropic reformer, to
include his own image, or eikom, among those that he sets out
to pulverise beyond hope of recognition. Let him engage him-
self as his own Aunt Sally, and so establish the impartiality of
his critical attitude.
6th, 7th.-I have a right horror of the egoism which finds
amusement in making an enigma of itself at the expense of a
public that has an itch for personal revelation. My moral
position is of an almost pellucid transparency. I am an in-
tellectual Puritan to the finger-tips, with an affectionate
tolerance for the candour of a Mercutio. That is a conjunc-
tion, surely, that asks no apologic explication. And I will be
yet more open with the world, and declare myself the charlatan
I am. If I have given my friends to understand that I am
immeasurably superior to SHAKESPEAR, I was trading upon their
credulity. In point of fact, he is very nearly my equal; as a
dramatic technician, that is ; not, of course, as an exponent of
latter-day philosophy.
8TH-10TH.—Perhaps the most pathetic feature in the modern
drama—and SHAKESPEAR himself is not altogether blameless in
this connection—is its fatuous penchant for associating action
with motive. Yet, in real life, if there is one thing more obvious
than another (which I doubt) it is that the commonest motive
for action is to have none at all. Take arson. You will say
that arson is a relatively untypical expression of energy. On
the contrary, I see it mentioned in the papers at least once a
quarter. Take arson, then. Do we ever find that jealousy,
hatred, revenge—those darling bugbears of the Romantic stage
—have been the motive for this form of action ? Seldom, or
never. People commit arson as a medicine for ennui, to make
pass the time; or else out of a morbid curiosity for noting the
play of firelight on neighbouring scenery; motives so light
that they may be practically disregarded, as they would most
certainly be flouted in those hotbeds of Romanticism, the
theatre and the law-courts.
11th, 12th.-Or, again, take Love, which is popularly sup-
posed to be more common than arson. When has Love ever
constituted a motive for action? Only in the last decade or
so, under the influence of sentimental drama. So vacant,
indeed, are my countrymen of all original imagination that the
decadent stage, masquerading as the mirror of humanity, has
actually imposed its own conventions of Love upon the very
lives from which it professed to draw them.
18TH-15TH.—I have elsewhere said that “ten years of cheap
reading have changed the English from the most stolid nation
in Europe to the most theatrical and hysterical.” I would go
further and point to the terrible corruption in foreign manners
bred of contact with British decadence. Travel, as I have
done, among the Latin races, and mark the recent changes in
their demeanour. In rural byways they still retain that
decorum of carriage and behaviour which comes of unspoiled
intercourse with earth. But in the cities, and even in those
villages that lie upon the tourist's beaten track, you will
recognise the growth of demonstrativeness in their gestures,
and pseudo-dramatic methods in their deportment. What is
the cause of this degeneracy? They have become infected by
the deadly germs of that Anglomania which is also responsible
for their recent adoption of manly sports, so-called, and other
intolerable brutalities.
16th.--To recur to the subject of accepted conventions—
what hope is there for the salvation of audiences saturated
with artificiality? None, though it were my own lips that
essayed to recall them to the real. Go back to Italy's Venice,
after witnessing its counterfeit in Olympia, and you will never
“recapture the first fine careless rapture.” I am, so to speak,
the original Venice.
18th, 19th.-There is a tale told of certain visitors at the
court of a semi-barbaric king, who offered to supply him with
a nightingale, a bird of which hitherto he had no cognisance.
During a temporary delay in its arrival they sought to appease
the monarch by producing an instrument guaranteed to emit
music of the same order. So beglamored was the king by its
ravishing melodies that on the ultimate appearance of the
actual warbler he dismissed the latter with contumely as a
poor imitation of the original. I am, as it were, the real
nightingale. O. S.
(To be continued.)
MORE MUNIFICENCE FOR MILLIONAIRES.
MR. CARNEGIE's magnificent generosity—“princely" is no
word for it, since no royal personage anywhere could afford to
do anything like it—may encourage others to imitate him. As
Mr. CARNEGIE pays the fees of the college students in Scotland,
some other wealthy person may be disposed to give a much
smaller sum for one of the following purposes, that is the
income to pay in perpetuity:—
The milliners' bills of all the ladies performing in any one
London theatre.
The hatters' bills of all the literary men in Great Britain. A
very small capital sum would suffice for this.
Week-end trips to the country or seaside, including subscrip-
tions to golf clubs, for all the journalists in London.
The tailors' bills of, say, one hundred millionaires, dukes,
cabinet ministers, and other eminent persons least particular
about the cut and newness of their clothes. A cheap gift.
The whole of the tax on the staple product or manufacture of
the constituency represented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer
for the time being.
One-eighth per cent. of the taxes on the staple products
or manufactures of the constituencies represented by the
Opposition for the time being.
The wages, calculated according to their skill in whatever
trades they profess to follow, of all the strike 'agitators in the
British Empire, on condition of their doing, writing, and saying
nothing.
The whole cost of “decorating ” St. Paul's Cathedral, now
or at any time, including the gilt iron railings on the cornice
and other music-hall adornments, on condition that the building
is left entirely untouched.
The cost of repairing ten London streets, on the present
system.
The cost of repairing all the London streets, on some better
system.
The haircutters' bills of all the pianists and other musical
performers in Europe. A mere trifle.

VISITORS IN OUR VILLAGE.
I.—MR. SILAS P. JENKS.
HE had come, so he told us in the bar
of the "Green Dragon" (where he had
petrified the landlord by demanding in
turn "a Moral Elevator" and "a Dewy
Sunrise," by way of liquid refreshment),
in order to study British rural life. "No,
Sir," he said, "I concede that there 'a
nothing like it on our side. There 's a
sort o' as-it-was-in-the-beginning feel in
your air that's vnrry reposeful, and I
intend to let it soak in. You 've got the
old farm-houses, and the green lanes, and
the chirrupy dickey-birds, just as I 've
met 'em in the story-books. I was bound
to see one of your sleepy old villages,
anyhow, and as for this place—why, I
reckon you can hear it snoring!"
Farmer GILES, who has just bought a
brand-new patent reaper, was about to
utter an indignant protest, but Mr. JENKS
cut it short.
"No, stranger," said he, "don't you
trouble to chip in. Why, if there was as
much progress hereabouts as would cover
a cent it would spoil the lot. The vurry
cows have a kind o" just-stepped-out-o'-
the-Ark look about 'em. Say, likely there's
a cottage in the neighbourhood where the
Poet SHAKSPEARE panned out a poem or
two?"
"We had to admit that there wasn't.
"Or a wood, maybe, where MILTON put
in a spell o' versifying?"
We shook our heads.
"Wall," said Mr. JE.NKS, obviously
disappointed, "there 's bound to be same
improving an' historic scenes in the
neighbourhood which I roust inspect.
Let's see your newspaper."
We explained that the Slowboroitgli
Gazette wasn't published before Friday,
and that it did not reach Puddleton till
the carrier brought it next day.
"Snakes!" exclaimed Mr. JENKS," d'you
mean to say that you "re a community of
five or six hundred able-bodied citizens
and haven't a journal of your own? Why,
I '11 start one for you myself!"
And he did. The next day he went over
to Slowborough, our market town, to
interview tho local printers, whom he
described subsequently as "the derndest
old fossils that ever handled a stereo."
A week later appeared No. 1 of the Puddle-
ton Pelican. To say that it made a sensa-
tion would be gravely to understate the
truth. It was indeed, as its editor
claimed, "a real, live, snappy journal;
calculated to make things hum." Things
did more than hum, they fairly boiled
after its appearance. Its first column
was taken up with an article, chiefly about
stars, stripes, and a soaring eagle, of which
no one in Puddleton could understand a
word. But this was followed by a page
headed "Social Sparklets." A few

NAUGHTY DONKST."
Little Girl. "On, WHAT A SHAME, NUKSE! HE ISN'T A NAUGHTY DONKEY. HB'S ONLY

extracts from it will help you to realise
its effect upon our peaceful village.
"Mr. GILES has succeeded at last in
selling his red cow. Mr. BLOOGINS is the
unfortunate purchaser, and his remarks
on the transaction are exceedingly pictur-
esque. He will shortly be seen wearing
new foot-gear."

"Is it true—in the interests of public
morality we ask the question—is it true
that Miss JEMIMA TIMSON" (our village
schoolmistress, a most respectable lady of
about fifty) "again walked home from
church on Sunday night with Dr. SNOOKS"
(our local medical man)? "Alas! there
seems no doubt about it. Oh, naughty,
naughty JEMIMA!"

"Mr. STUDBS, we hear, is about to retire
from the police-force, and it is proposed to
present him with a testimonial. The land-
lord of the "Green Dragon," doubtless,
will head the subscription list. He has
good reason to know—and so has Mrs. S.
—that P.O. STUBBS is a public benefactor."
* * * *
Next day a deputation called on Mr.
SILAS P. JENKINS. While disapproving
generally, they said, of American institu-
tions, there was one which Puddleton was
inclined to adopt. Tar and feathers, they
believe, formed prominent features in it.

LIGHTER THAN EVER.—According to re-
port there is quite a new kind of illumina-
tor coming into the market that will
compete successfully with gas and elec-
tricity. It is apparently a process of
incandescence applied to petroleum. It is
known as the Kitson system. In future

it from its competitor, "the Kitson."

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Gamblers (HCTCHiNSON & Co.), by WILLIAM LE QUECX,
give occasion to The Grumblers who, having taken up this
book and become deeply interested in it at the outset, began
to weary of it about midway, and were finally inclined to drop
it altogether before the finish. It promised well, but it breaks
down in performance. Mr. LE QUEUX can do something vastly
better than this.
Mr. TOM GALLON does not trouble himself about probabilities.
When he has conceived a story he goes right on and right
through with it, making things fit generally in manner con-
vincing by its coolness. The Second Dandy Chater (HUTCHresos)
gets his name, and has laid for him the foundation of a strange
history, owing to the eccentricities of his father. That gentle-
man's wife having presented him with twins, he thinks the
bounty is a little too much. Accordingly he ships one off to
Australia, and, a man entirely above small prejudices, he Delects
for expatriation the elder, the rightful heir of his name and
broad acres. The younger, coming into the estates, turns oat to
be rather a bad egg. In brief, he associates with the most
melodramatic London criminals, commits burglary, forgery, and,
finally, murder. The rightful heir returns home just in time to
learn that his brother has in turn been murdered. His resem-
blance to the late twin is so marvellous that, the fact of the
murder being the secret of an extremely limited circle, he is
accepted as the owner of Chater Hall, and all that pertains
thereto. Amongst his responsibilities are the consequences of
the forgery, burglary, and murder aforesaid. It will be seen
that here is material for many complications, which my Baronite
recommends the gentle reader to unravel in the volume.
In Rosa Amorosa by GEORGE EOERTON (GKANT RICHARDS), says
my Baronitess, we have yet another collection of a woman's
love-letters. But the exact nationality of this writer is not
definitely mentioned. No doubt she is a British maiden of a
very progressive type, to judge from the freedom of her out-
pourings and her decidedly Ibsenitish morals on matrimony.
Her one idea in allowing her friend the author to publish these
effusions was apparently her overwhelming desire to show the
world "her pretty talent for loving." The letters are frankly
realistic, not idealistic.
An assistant reader writes: — In Men and Letters (JOHN
LANE) Mr. HKHBERT PAUL has given us a delightful book of
essays. Mr. PAUL is a scholar, but he wears his learning
lightly, like a flower, and shakes the petals out on the path
of his reader. Moreover, Mr. PAUL'S touch is as light and
his style as brilliant as his reading is wide, and his memory
accurate. He deals with SWIFT, with GIBBON, with SELDEN,
with the \7ictorian novelists, with HALIFAX, with the letters of
BYRON, with the decay of quotation, with the classical poems
of TENNYSON—I cite these to show the breadth of the author's
sympathy, and his range of subjects—and on all he has many
brilliant, suggestive and witty things to say. His fund of good
stories is inexhaustible, and his urbanity never fails. On the
whole, this book is one of the very best examples of literature
on literature and life.
From such a sinister sobriquet as " Black Mary," by ALAN
McAULAY (T. FISHER UNWIN), any skilled reader would probably
expect a tragedy of dungeons and daggers, and will be agree-
ably surprised by a simple romance of Scottish life a hundred
years ago. The heroine, a very charming girl, is only thus
unpleasantly styled from the certainly queer circumstances of
her West Indian parentage, which shock the severe morals of
her northern relations to whom she is sent. The characters of
tho hard Aunty BARBARA and her brother JAMES stand out
clearly. It is pleasantly written, and the quiet humdrumiiess
of life in those far-off days makes itself felt throughout. The
only drawback is the too frequent use of "dialect." A neces-
sary fault, perhaps, in, such a story.
Anni Fnaacex, by R. C. LKHMANN (JOHN LANE), is a delightful
collection of lightly tripping verses, written with all the spirit
and freedom of youth, hero and there chastened by an occa-
sional tap on the shoulder from Time the Remembrancer.
To the truth of the sentiment in Cambridge Revisited not a few
University men, who have managed to keep abreast (in their
own estimation) with Academic times, and to be part and parcel
of the up-to-date.st spirit of the University, will bear witness.
Sufficient to its day is the Cambridge thereof. "And after?"
You are a ghost revisiting the shades ; if not a Bogey, certainly
a Fogey. THE BARON DK B.-W.
"DECORATIONS."
I.
WHEN the whirligig of fashion with its customs full of change
Comes invading British dwellings with a craze that's wild and
strange,
If the style be Japanesy, for the dado and the walls,
Just select an awful paper, over which a dragon sprawls.
Then with fans of varied patterns—some little jars of blue,
Grinning masks, grotesque and ugly plus a screen of bent
bamboo,
And a bunch of reeds and grasses like a dissipated broom,
You complete the modern notion of a Japanesy room.
'Tis an easy room, a f riezy room, a jarry, Japanesy room,
With many creepy spiders and a green and yellow stool:
'Tis a creaky room, a freaky room, a rather make-you-shrieky
room
Not really Japanesy, but the Japanesy school.
II.
If you feel the world is flippant and you sigh for ghosts and
gloom,
Have a longing for apartments damp and chilly as a tomb,
In a cold, cobwebby chamber tatter'd banners you display,
With a knight or two in armour, and some relics of the fray.
Then you buy some modern portraits of ancestors old and grim,
While a "glacier" decoration makes the light subdued and
dim. •
And the guests will start and shudder and ask themselves to
whom
They really are indebted for this fearful feudal room.
'Tis a musty room, a fusty room, a dusty room, a gusty room,
The men in armour rattle as you walk across the floor;
'Tis a shaky room, a quaky room, a keep-you-wide-awakey room.
And you 're always thinking something will be coming through
the door.
III.
Presume you 're unincumbered and more go-ahead than neat,
Then your room 's a bit eccentric, and your pictures indiscreet;
You 've a cabinet collection—where a pose is nicely caught,
Some arc signed and have been given, some are c/iic and have
been bought.
There are odds and ends you value and have fastened up with
tacks,
There's the "Ref" and there's the "Pink 'Un" and some
Frenchy yellow-backs.
'Tis a den of wwoct contentment that is innocent of broom,
But tho' littered and disordered, 'tis a ripping little room.
'Tis a cozy room, a dozy room, a forty-wink-reposy room,
With foils and gloves and golfing clubs and fishing-rod and
gun.
A crazy room, a lazy room, an often smoky-hazy room,
A favourite room with pictures of the favourites that have
won. HUAN MSB.

A WHIT-MONDAY CATASTROPHE.
"CAN 's PULL vs. Jmt"
"PULL YKK: WHY, BLESS TBK 'AKT,
HELEPHANT! JUMP IN, ALL OF TBK!"
E 8 AS STKOSil AS A
THEY JUMP IN!
OCCASIONAL OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday, May 20.—Hansel nnd Orctel (in German) so popular
as to be given again with a new witch in it, Miss EDITH MILLER.
The fact is, they keep so many bewitching ladies in stock at
Covent Garden, that it is the easiest thing in the world, should
one be absent, to immediately nnd an excellent substitute.
"Second time I 've seen Hansel wul Qretel," says our youthful
and enthusiastic critic, specially turned on for this juvenile
Humpty-duiupty-dinoHsh Opera, "and I am quite in love with
FrUulcins DAVID and FELSER; they make one feel quite young
again!" Which is praise indeed, coming from a critic of such
ripe experience as is invariably associated with "sweet
seventeen."
The attraction to-night was the appearance of Signer
ANSELMI as Turiddu in MASCAGM'S Cavalleria Ruaticana.
As we observed of his rendering of the Duke in Riyoletto, he
can sing most tunefully and feelingly, and he can act. The
drinking song received a hearty encore, to which the new tenor
smilingly responded. When a tonor is new to a Covent Garden
audience he is so obliging, so courteous! Sing? Oh, anything!
Encore? Oh, not the slightesttronble in the world. Certainly,
as many encores as you like, and we '11 see who tires first.
But when his popularity is established and lie is master of the
situation, then the tenor will bow politely, will shake his
head at the conductor as who would say, " No, decidedly not;
get on with the opera," and will be deaf to the plaudits of the
"upper sukkles" and of the gallery, applaud they never so
loudly or unwisely. "Plaudite," says the great tenor to them
in effect, "Plaudite—et valete!
The remainder of the cast the same as when the opera was
given the previous week, M. DECLERY being a dramatic Alflo,
Mile. MAUBOURO effective as the seductive Carmen-i-cal Lola.
Mile. BAUERMEISTER a sweet dame Lucia, who pities the
sorrows of everybody generally, while in Mile. STRAKOSt'H the
unfortunate Hantuzzii finds a more than adequate representative.
So far highly satisfactory. Specially ANSELMI. Hope new
tenor won't knock up, so that, when one of his enthusiastic
admirers should go specially to hear him, the announcement
should be made that he is hoarse de combat. Whereupon
enthusiastic admirers will piteously exclaim, " O ANSELMI! how
cruel of a cold to thus attack you an' sell me so!" [Exit.
AFTER THE WHITSUN HOLIDAY.
(Voices from the Throng.)
GOT to Paris and back, and saw something new at the
theatres. But rather glowing.
Bonnets quite uieii.r jeu, my dear.
Really the stores anticipate the Boulevards.
Of course one can see "lovely Lucerne" in a week, but one
has a good deal more of a not very lovely railway carriage.
English watering-place for a week, and rather trying to the
waiters' and the guests' tempers.
When a fashionable hotel's population rises suddenly from
six to six hundred it causes confusion.
A day's trip across the Channel simply a dream when it's
fine, but rather a nightmare when the weather 's uncertain.
Yes, you must be fairly expeditious if you want to get
through your lunch between the arrival of one boat at Boulogne
and the departure of the other for Folkestone.
Rather fun meeting acquaintances on the deck, as they
become ever after your friends for life.
Precious hard work travelling all day and all night, with
half-hour pauses for sight-seeing.
Yes, yes, yes, all very well—but there "s no place like home.

THE NEW GALLERY.
THE Hon. JOHN COLLIER has hit upon the happy idea of
representing at 86, Mr. Rudyard Kipling as martyring him-
self, a la mode de St. Laurentius, in front of a stove. He is ap-
parently ruminating as to •whether it is time to turn and be done
on the other side, the only evident reason for his not turning is
that the artist has done him so thoroughly well on 'the side
exposed to the spectator. However, the name of RUDYARD
KIPLING is associated with a hot climate and various •warm
corners. A very serious KIPLING is he in this picture; not at
all one of the "Kiplings blithe and merry" as he was wont
to be called by early scribes.
Compliments to C. E. PERUGINI, on his charming portrait of
Mrs. PERUGISI, 40, which is the number of the picture, of
course. Mrs. PERUGISI is also a distinguished sister of the
brush, and Mr. C. E. PERUGINI is one of the few husbands who,
with honest pride, can admit that " his wife paints."
There is a speaking likeness, by EDWIN A. WARD, of "S. L.
Clement," popularly known as " MARK TWAIN,"and certainly the
alias" is well chosen, this being a "speaking" likeness of a
man, who, as a gifted humorous orator, is equal to any twain of
them, pick 'em where you will—even among his own generally
first-rate post-prandial orating fellow-countrymen.
80. Don't be misled by the title of this picture, "The Bridge,"
to imagine you are going to see a tableau representing ladies and
gentlemen engaged in the game of cards now so much in vogue.
No; Mr. WELLESLEY COTTRELL hasn't done this, but has painted
a pretty country picture and also "The Brook," 91. And
these two may be taken as three subjects, closely akin, since in
representing Bridge and Brook he has painted Well,
131. S. MELTON FISHER'S portrait of Sir Henry Drummond
Wolff is life-like. Such a picture could not be rejected even by
those most eager to keep the wolf from the door.
145. A Dorsetshire Pastoral. By SIDNEY MoORE. Delight-
ful! Absolutely still life. Nothing of the moor about it
except in the name of the clever artist. Any picture purchaser
who has finished his collection would do well to reconsider the
matter and add just this one Moore.
105. In designing " The Naiads' Pool," and showing us these
nice nudities with curiously entwined legs, Mr. HERBERT
DRAPER might have given them just a few garments out of his
drapery.
125. Clever picture of Mrs. HUMPHRY'S. "Hard to hold.'
A girl holding a kitten. But surely the little thing with silkei
fur must be soft to hold, not hard. Odd 1
150. C. E. HALLE'S Hero is a Heroine.
157. C. NAPIER HEMY, A.R.A., shows two fishermen in a boa
"Counting the Catch." Delightfully briny. Boat curiousl
unaffected by the decidedly rough sea. If this were always the
case, viz., the worse the sea the steadier the boat, when
painted by Mr. C. N. HEMY, then we would invariably go to him
when we wanted our little yacht painted. Perhaps this mar
vellously un-rockiugboat is being held steady by " the painter.'
May be. If this artist would turn his attention to a scene on
shore in social life abroad, he has only got to give hi
title a twist, and instead of two men "counting a catch" h
could substitute two lady-adventuresses "Catching a Count.'
N.B.—No extra charge for suggestion.
225. The Earl of Stair, K.T., by Sir GEORGE REID, P.R.S.A.
nobleman who, judging from his title, must always have his
yes wide open.
Those who come to see pictures, the pictures of the sea
will delight, such as 232, "Estuary of the Kith." A lady
ooking at this observed, "How odd I one lives and learns!
always thought an Estuary was a sort of Notary, or an Under-
writer at LLOYDS!"
259. The Duke of Portland, ably represented by JOHN 8.
iAHGENT, R.A., with two most unique and remarkable speci-
mens of feathered collies or bird-dogs, calculated to famish
.elightfully picturesque " boas " for ladies. Dogs of a feather
here together.
Now we must come away. Can't go upstairs to see the
mounted pictures.
A BADER IN MAY.
ON the programme of Mr. HAROLD BAUER'S pianoforte recitals,
'under the management of Mr. SHARPE "—a name of which the
musical punster will inevitably avail himself unless he is warned
>ff in time—there is an announcement of " The new baby Grand,"
who is "pleasing to look upon," and so forth and so forth, all*
n praise of the infant, bless its little heart—we very nearly wrote
'tiny" for "little," but tiny might be mispronounced "tinny,"
and that would never do unless with a " coote " before it, but
even then, though there's a " COOTE and TiNNEY" band, there
sn't a ditto and ditto piano: at least, not as far as we know.
3ut this does not explain "baby Grand." It might be a new
lovel by clever "SARAH GRAND," whose Twins were so de-
ightful. It is not. "Pinafore" melodies should be played on
a " baby Grand." The visitors on Friday next will, we hope,
je as pleased with " Papillons, Op. 2," as they were on Wednes-
day last with Op. 22 ("Like 'Ops, 'cos 1 'm a bit of a dancer my-
self," as 'Arry observed) and with "Variations by BRAHMS on
a theme by PAGANINI," which, with such names, and such an
executant, ought to be something to remember. Such a pro-
gramme should attract to the "Bauer Saloon" all who have
any interest in the great beer question, seeing it is so full of
excellent '"ops."
By the way, how readily musical expressions arise to the lips
of concert-goers on these occasions. Only recently an energetic
lady was hurrying to her seat—the wrong one, as she had passed
her own—when her daughter, slowly following, exclaimed,
"Allegro, ma, non troppo!" Whereupon her mother retraced
her steps and took her right seat.

NEW READING.—Only just discovered it. In Macbeth. The
Thane, with Banquo, meets the Weird Sisters. Macbeth and
Banquo, being victorious, are, of course, walking home after a
grand banquet given in their honour by the Best United Scotch
Club of the period. National drinks and dishes. What more
natural then that, "seeing things," and being—like the
whiskey he has been taking—" a little mixed," General Afacbeth
should exclaim—
"How now, ye secret black and midnight Haggis,
What is 't ye do?"
I find on examination that this wasn't said on the occasion of
his first introduction to these elderly ladies, but on his visit
to the witches when they gave an "At Home" in their own
spacious cave. But this is a detail. Macbeth had just been
dining, of course, and he must have screwed his courage to
the sticking point in order to have paid this visit. Anyway, it
is evidently what our WULLIE McSHAKSPEARE meant, or why
should he have chosen a Scotch subject at all?

THE VALUE OF GYMNASTICS.
[At a recent meeting of the Gymnastic Teachers
Institute, the Lord Chief Justice, who presided,
observed that if systematic physical training for
girls was more widely adopted, we should see far
fewer young ladies with bent-over ankles and
turned-over feet walking along the street.]
IF sisters you possess, dear boy,
Whose bones are still elastic,
See that a training they enjoy
Both mental and gymnastic.
The vaulting-horse improvement brings
In leaping and in running.
Girls take quite cheerfully to "rings"
(Excuse my trick of punning).
The rings expand their brains and chests—
Mens sana in corpore sano—
Say no to that you can't—(my jests
Sparkle like Pommery-Greno).
By parallels they may be taught
To hold a perfect balance—
They will not lose it when they 're sought
By half-a-dozen gallants!

Whate 'er her rank or station.

And, last not least, they'll bring ere
My dreams to full fruition.
Then shall my eye ne'er meet, with pain
Which in my bosom rankles,

With satisfaction I shall deign
To note their nice straight ankles!

Is she anxious to guide the policy of

Is she an angel of light, or one of a

Is she a peg upon which to hang anec-

OH, tell me, CHRISTOBEL, my queen,
Didst deem my manner strangely cold,
When in the twilight, yester-e'en,
We side by side together strolled?
For it had been a day of days,
As far as weather was concerned;
At noon, the sun with scorching rays
Our delicate complexions burned.
Released at length from Winter's thrall,
We both inhaled the breath of Spring;
At first I revelled in it all,
And felt as happy as a king.
But as we tramped o'er hill and dale
The long day through, with cheeks
Did you observe my spirits fail, [aglow;
My conversation cease to flow?
We plucked the golden daffodil—
Of Nature I am very fond;
You were enthusiastic, till
You found that I did not respond.
We watched the sunset to the last,
And as a solemn stillness fell,
A spasm o'er my features passed,
Which made you think 1 was not well.
You grew romantic by and bye,
The happy future you could see;
Doubtless you heard me heave a sigh,
And grind my teeth in misery.
Homeward I did escort you soon,
And hurriedly I said farewell.
Beneath the newly risen moon
I kissed you coldly, CHRISTOBEL.
And were you filled with haunting fears
When I had vanished from your eyes?
Perchance you wept some bitter tears,
So now let me apologise.
It was not that I loved you less
Than I had over done before.
This fact allow me to impress,
You are the one whom I adore.
I did not find your presence pall
Upon me—not one little bit.
When something 's pleasant, after all,
One cannot have too much of it.

awaited the onslaught. WINCHESTER, of
milder mood, conscious of exceptional
provocation given by him last week,
strategically, though to all appearances
quite casually, got his brother of LONDON
between himself and the PREMIER.
Happily for peace and propriety of
House, the vision of the nurserymaid
crossed the PREMIER'S eye; as effective
in its way as earlier historic vision of
the housemaid. Bishop of HEREFORD,
presumably drawing on domestic ex-
periences, instanced in proof of spread
of the plague of betting that the nursery-
maid habitually "had her shilling on"
the coming race. Fervid fancy pictured
daily scenes in the nursery under
this malignant influence. Master CLAUD,
tetat 7, in a white hat (much too large for
liim), standing on his mother's bandbox
shouting "Ten to one bar one!" Sister
GLADYS, four last birthday, responding
in shrill voice, "Five to one on the
field!"
"Is that the kind of public betting you
hope to put a stop to?" the MARKISS
asked in withering tones. "What
machinery have you to enable you to put
a stop to nurserymaids putting a shilling
on each succeeding race?"
Admirable point this. Well if MARKISS
had stopped when he had made it. Always
a mistake when an expert in a particular
field, whether it be the nursery or the
housemaid's department, steps outside it.
Encouraged by applause lavishly bestowed,
the MARKISS next alluded to "large
crowds that on Sunday morning assemble
round one man in order to give him tips."
TWEEDMOUTH, more familiar with the sub-
ject, explained that the crowd is gathered
not to give tips to the one man but to
receive and pay for tips distributed by
him.
"Very well then," said the MARKISS,
with manner curiously reminiscent of
PRINCE ARTHUR when in the other House
he geta hold of the wrong end of the
stick; "the crowd assembles to pay for
tips."
House accepted the frank and ready
correction. But it broke the spell of
omniscience with which the earlier pas-
sage about the nurserymaid had been
delivered. In the end, protesting ho

explosions of cordite. Six years ago next
month—-when Mr. GLADSTONE, the MEMBER
FOR SARK, DON CURRIE, and other eminent
Htutesmon were away at Kiel, in the now-
wrecked Tantallon Castle, helping GERMAN
EMPEROR to open new canal—cordite ex-
plosion under Treasury Bench blew into
Opposition CAWMBLL-BANNBRMAN and his
colleagues in the Rosebery Government.
It was BRODRICK who fired the charge,
and the whirligig of time has brought him
to fill the position whence he was instru-
mental in discharging C.-B.
Cordite having done its work nothing
more heard of it till, the other night,
PRINCE ARTHUR incidentally mentioned
that at particular crisis of campaign in
South Africa there were only 3,000 rounds
in store. This afternoon C.-B. commented
on this concatenation of circumstances.
The very men who had turned him and his
friends out on alleged insufficiency of
ammunition, who had been in office for six
years, who had asked for and obtained
millions for war purposes, were thus
caught dangerously napping.
Nasty blow that; would have discon-
certed some men. PRINCE ARTHUR splen-
did in his audacity. It was, he vowed,
all C.-B.'s fault. In 1895, he, being at the
head of the War Office, was found guilty
of insufficient stores of cordite; very pro-
perly kicked out of office. Five years later,
his critics of 1895 having meanwhile been
in power, and having raised Army expen-
diture from eighteen and a half millions
to thirty millions, it was suddenly dis-
covered that the country being at war,
the stock of ammunition was almost ex-
hausted. Who was responsible? The
Minister in charge of the War Office
since 1895? Certainly not. It was the
guilty Minister whose sin had found him
out six years ago.
This PRINCK ARTHUR s;vid without
shadow of a smile, without movement
of an eyelid distantly suggesting a wink.
The unexpected assault took C.-B.'s breath
:i way. For u moment a pause of amazement
fell on the crowded benches. Then some-
one behind Treasury Bench cheered; cry
taken up till it swelled to a roar, through
whoso prolonged length PniNCK ARTHUR
glared with honest indignation on the
limp C.-B., who began to think that he was
really much more sinful than he thought.

LOVE-LETTERS OF A DANISH WOMA_N.
(Published fur the first time after a pause
of centuries.)
MY LORD,—You will never receive this
letter. It was not my fault. My father
told me to do it. But why should he have
been killed for listening behind the cur-
tains? Ho was acting for the best. He
is always so kind. The best of men. And
why tell me to go to a convent? And why
say that I paint? My hair is all my own.
And so are you. If you would only let it
be so. But surely you can be reasonable.
And yet you will never know. And you
are always in my thoughts. Oh! my
Lord, my dear Lord, my dearest Lord. I
don't believe my brother. I know he is
spiteful to everyone. And I am glad he
is going for a trip—far, far away.
Your Onest, O.
My DEAREST LORD,—I feel it is un-
maidenly to write to you. But this letter
will never reach you, so I am comforted.
Surely it was cruel to make a scene when
we had come to see your little play. Of
course, we like amateur theatricals.' But
then you did not do us the honour to ask
us to take part in them. You preferred
professionals. And Court life in Elsinore
is not too cheerful. I never thought that
you would take back the presents that
you gave me, but you did. And I thought
it was so kind of you to sit near me. But
then you should not have caused all that
disturbance. You sadly grieved your
mother. And she is such a sweet thing.
Means so well. And really, your uncle—
step-father—is so anxious to be civil.
What is the matter with you? But I shall
never know, for you will never receive
this poor letter. I have heard from my
brother. LAERTES seems to be enjoying
himself; but, naturally, poor papa's
untimely end came as a shock. Of course,
I sent no details. They were too painful.
Oh! my own one. Oh! my darling. I do
so wish you were more reasonable.
Your unknown lover, O.
SWEETEST,—My last letter. You will
never receive it. Perhaps it may be found
on the stream, floating along amongst the
water-lilies. I have taken to singing,—
although my music master never thought
me a very promising pupil. But itdistracts
my thoughts—which are sad ones. LAERTES
seems to be t i red with his t ravels, and sends
a scrap to say that he is on his way home.
I feel at times rather wrong in my head. I
won't let my maid touch iny hair, and have
taken to decorating it with wild flowers.
They look rather pretty but untidy. And
now I am going for a little walk, and then
I shall have a nice long rest by the stream
amongst the willows. My own, my dear-
est, my all-in-black one. But you will
never know—until it is too late.
Your poor distracted
OPHELIA.

[MAT 29, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PICKLETHORN'S CONTRIBUTION.
MR. PICKLKTHORN adjusted his spectacles, took up the
letter and read it through twice very carefully and deliberately.
Then, with an air of bewilderment, he gazed at a slip of pink
paper enclosed within it. Next he studied the envelope, duly
addressed to "JOSIAH PICKLETHORN, Esq., The Hollies, Wimble-
don," carefully scrutinising the postmarks as if in the hope
that these could solve the riddle for him. Finally, with a
despairing sigh, lie handed the letter across the breakfast-table
to his wife.
"What the dickens does this mean?" he enquired. "Read
it, M AKI A, and let's hear what you make of it. It must be some
idiotic mistake—and yet it seems meant for me right enough!"
Mrs. PICKLETHORN read the letter in her turn, her face
betraying increasing astonishment as she did so. It ran:—
"Office of 'Tlie Trumpet Magazine,'
"Fleet Street, B.C.
"DEAR 8iR, — We are now making arrangements for the
Christmas Number of the Magazine, and should like to include
in it one of your humorous sketches. Pour thousand words
would be a suitable length, and the payment we could offer
would be £15. In the hope that our proposal will be agreeable
to you, we enclose cheque for half that sum, the balance to be
paid on publication. We should be glad to have your MS. at
the earliest possible date. Yours faithfully,
"T. HENDERSON, Editor."
"Good gracious I" exclaimed Mrs. PICKLETHORN, dropping
the letter and staring at her husband. "One of your humorous
sketches!"
"One of my humorous sketches," repeated Mr. PICKLETHORN,
"The editor of this paper, or magazine, or whatever it is,
writes to me for one of my humorous sketches to put in his
Christmas Number. And here's his cheque, too, payable to
JOSIAH PICKLETHORN. One of my humorous sketches! Forty
years have I been in the sugar trade, MARIA, and, except in the
way of business or a friendly letter, I haven't set pen to paper
since I left school. Why this HENDERSON writes to me, and
what he means—or if somebody 's trying to play a silly joke—
well, it just boats me!"
"It can't be a joke," observed his wife thoughtfully. "No
one would send you a cheque as a joke. And it can't well be a
mistake, seeing that it's addressed right, with your Christian
name and all. No, he must have heard of you, somehow."
"Seems like it, doesn't it?" agreed the other.
"Perhaps he knows one of our friends?"
"Quito possible," admitted the sugar-broker. "But even i:
ho does, why"
"Yes," resumed Mrs. PICKLETHORN, with growing conviction
"one of your friends must have spoken to this editor about
those clever stories you sometimes tell—no, don't deny it
JOSIAH, they ore clever. Why, only last Tuesday, when the
JOHNSONS wero dining hero, and you gave us that description o
how your Aunt lost her way in the Edgwaro Road, Mrs
JOHNSON said to mo that you ought to send that to Punch."
"Well, well," said Mr. PICKLKTHORN, with a gratified smile
"I don't deny that I love a bit of a joke now and then. 'Tis t
poor heart that never rejoices, as SHAKSPKARE, I believe, puts
it."
"Why, it's as plain as a pikestaff I This editor, you see, was
talking about his paper to a friend. 'The Magazine's all right,
says he, 'but what I want to make it complete is a right-down
good piece of fun, and whore it's to come from I can't tell.
•D'you know Mr. JOSUH PICKLETHORN?' asks the friend
'Can't say I do,' replies the Editor. 'Well,' says the friend
• you just get him to give you one of his stories, and you
readers will laugh as they've never laughed before.' 'Thanl
vou,' says the Editor, 'I '11 ask him' ; and so he sits down am
writes you this letter. That's the explanation, depend upon
t."
"It may be," allowed Mr. PICKLETHORN dubiously; "I can't
hink of any other. Well, then, in that case, I '11 just drop him
a note, thanking him for the offer, bat returning his cheque, as
don't happen to be in the writing line."
'W7hat?" cried his wife indignantly. "Return his cheque,
ndeed! To think of throwing away money like that! You 'II
do nothing of the kind; you '11 just sit down this evening, and
write off that story—it won't take you long."
'But I can't," protested Mr. PICKLETHORN. "Why, what
story could I write?"
"Nonsense, JOSIAH; of course you can. All you 've got to do
s to copy out one of those anecdotes you tell so splendidly—
:here 's that one, for instance, about your missing the last train
at Clapham."
Mr. PICKLETHORN pondered in silence for some moments.
"Seems a pity not to take that £15 certainly," he said; "and
I've often thought that, if I gave my mind to it, I could •write
t>etter stuff than lots of these literary fellows. . . Well, MARIA,
!'11 have a shot at it, if you like."
"Of course you will I You could write three stories a week
easily. That's £45 a week, which is"
"Hold hard, MARIA—the first one isn't written yet, and a
precious tough job I expect it '11 be. This letter says it's
t to be four thousand words long—that sounds a terrible
lot—and if it should be a mistake, after all! Look here, I '11
take that cheque to town with me and present it at once, and
if it's all right, why, I '11 tackle the story this evening. And
it's time for me to be starting for the City now. You might
get in a packet of foolscap paper from the stationer's while
I 'in gone."
And in the course of the morning, Mrs. PICKLETHORN received
the following satisfactory telegram—" Cheque all right."
That evening, after dinner, Mr. PIOKLETHOHN sat down to
compose his story, his wife having provided him with a new
nib, fresh blotting-paper, and an immense pile of foolscap
paper. The servants were enjoined that not a sound must be
heard from the kitchen; "Perfect quiet, my love," said Mr.
PICKLETHOIIN, "is absolutely essential." At the beginning,
his wife was allowed to witness his labours, but before long
the author found that her enquiries as to his progress, re-
peated every ten minutes, were exceedingly distracting, and,
accordingly, she was banished to the drawing-room, while Mr.
PICKLETHORN plied his pen in the dining-room. After much
consideration, the anecdote about his missing the last train
at Clapham—a story often recounted with gratifying success
amongst his friends—had been selected as most likely to charm
the readers of Tlie Trumpet, but Mr. PICKLETHORN found him-
self considerably hampered by the Editor's request, that the
story should be four thousand words long, which he inter-
preted to mean that there must be not one word more or less
than this number.
Presently, the author appeared at the drawing-room door in
his shirtsleeves, mopping a heated brow.
"Look here, MARIA," he said, "I've written it all down,
and 1 've only done two thousand one hundred and forty-seven.
I can spin it out a little longer, but I '11 never get to four
thousand!"
"You must work in another story as well, then," said his
wife promptly. "Couldn't you introduce that one about Miss
HAVILAND'S cockatoo?"
"Ah," said the author, visibly relieved. "I might do that;"
and he retreated downstairs again.
At midnight, Mrs. PICKLETHORN prepared to retire, at which
time her husband's total, as he announced, was two short of
three thousand. And he added his firm intention of finishing
one blessed thing before he went to bed.
When Mrs. PICKLETHORN had been asleep for a couple of hours

or so, she was awakened by tremendous
shouts from the ground-floor.
"MARIA I" cried her husband's voice,
"here-—come here, quickly!"
In some alarm, Mrs. PICKLETHORN slipped
on her dressing-gown, and peered over
the banisters. Two flights below her
stood her husband on the stairs, a bundle
of manuscript in his hand.
"Oh! there you are. Tell me, is 'wait-
ing-room' one word or two?"
"Is that all ?" said Mrs. PICKLETHORN,
in distinctly annoyed tones. "I thought

"Yes; but is 'waiting - room' one

"Oh, bother! Two, I suppose."

THE REVIEWERS' RETREAT.
IT was a noble-looking Institution.
Just the place where jaded reviewers and
ink-sodden critics would care to drone
away the last few years of their life. The
high wall that skirted the garden was
delicately tipped with sea-green bottle-
glass, thus ensuring peace and quiet from
prowling authors whose works the aged
reviewers may at some time or other have
considered.
The novelists' arbour was particularly
•well protected (no doubt advisably so) for
'twas here that reviewers of current
fiction took their afternoon tea, and
smoked their friendly "screws " of baccy
sent by well-disposed acquaintances.
Yet, despite the high wall, wire barbing,
&c., many a tragedy had been enacted
within this shady retreat. It was a
pathetic sight to see the palsied critics
doddering around with Mudie - hunted
expressions for their afternoon airing.
These all slept, by tho way, on the ground
floor, as they dreaded anything in the
nature of a story. A sad tradition exists
of one weary reviewer who roused his
comrades in the night by cries of agony.
As they gathered fearfully around him,
he pointed in horror through the window
at the stars. "A comet!" he cried. Then

adding, with a moan of anguish, " it has a ,
tail," he expired with a look of mortal
terror that almost drove his companions
frantic.
On another occasion a reviewer was
gossipping with a friend in the arbour
when a bomb from an unseen author
hurtled through the air, crushed the un-
fortunate victim and injured many others.
It was a religious novel; one of the most
dangerous missiles ever invented, combin-
ing a deadly heaviness with deadly
explosive qualities.
Turning from the novelists' arbour the
visitor may note the poets' yard, where
reviewers of minor poetry, essays, etc.,
undergo SANDOW'S exercises, and open-air
treatment generally after the debilitating
occupation they have followed for many
years. There is a new drill-sergeant
(CH-RT-N C-LL-xs by name), whose severi-
ties have inspired dismay throughout the
institution. Some of the more stalwart,
however, recently combined to withstand
his austere treatment, and he is at pre-
sent in the sick ward.
Visitors are urgently requested not to
tempt the inmates with gifts of high-
coloured adjectives and new adverbial
expressions. It is scarcely fair, since all
the inmates have to take a grammatical
pledge—and the simplest Saxon English
alone is served out with the rations.

MY DEAR SIR,—I am not a groat student

as a surprise to learn that LONGFELLOW

•was a poet, and, that, years ago, this cele-
brated bard had immortalised the present,
fashionable and absorbing game of
"Bridge." I was not aware that "Bridge"
was known in his time; but then he was
an American, therefore go-a-head; also a
poet, and a poet like a prophet is always
just a bit previous. However, Sir, to you

And the current that came in their favour

As, sweeping the tricks towards them,
"Grand slam," they scored,—ah me!
And walking home in the moonlight,
You might have heard a " D!"
And the loss of all my money
Liko a horrid dream appears;
And a flood of thought comes o'er me,
Which fills my eyes with tears.
Yet whenever I cross the club room,

I played on at Bridge at midnight
As the clocks were striking the hour,
And still to rise from the table,
Was quite beyond my power.
I saw my partner reflecting
On cards I was longing to see;
And wondered if he 'd make the trumps
Or if he would leave it to me!
But far from having such wisdom
On that lovely night in May,
How often, oh, how often,
In the days that had gone by,
I had played on at Bridge past midnight
When the betting had been high!
How often, oh, how often,
I had wished that luck's ebbing tide
Would bear away my wretched cards
To my adversaries' side!
Till my head grew hot and aching,
And my cards a real nightmare,
And the burden of playing a rubber,
Seemed greater than I could bear.
But now it has fallen from me,
And only in dreams I see,
The gold which I trusted that others
Would one day lose to me.
Foolish hope! the scene I find
Equals what I left behind,—
Crowded roads, whose human tide
Almost emulates Cheapside,
Whose hotels, superb and grand,
Seem transplanted from the Strand,
Where at once I happen on
SMITH and BROWN and ROBINSON.
Ah! then, since the quest is vain,
Homeward I return again,
Fain once more relief to seek
From my comrades of the week,
By an ignominious flight;
But to meet as I alight,
By the same train back in town—
ROBINSON and SMITH and BROWN.

TO
GENTLE lady, since I saw you last—
(Ah, those glorious weeks of summer weather!)
Dreary months on dreary months have passed
Since they sped away—alas, too fast!—
Those enchanted hours we spent together.
You of my poor heart again are queen,
Scorning other claims and dominations,
Other fainter loves that came between
(Ah, how futile now they seem, how mean !)
Now must yield their rival usurpations.
Yes, my all too fickle heart you bind,
Lady, with the chain of old that bound me,
All the glowing past I call to mind,
All that intervenes I leave behind,
Yielding to your spells that now surround uie.
What should stay me ?—'tis no idle shauie,
(If the world derides me, lady, let it!)
I would fain once more your gveeting claim,
Grasp your hand, and call upon your name—
But—upon my soul, I quite forget it.
THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A GREAT THOUGHT FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR.
SECOND SERIES.
V.—THE BERNARD SHAW SECTION.
(Continued from May.)
20TH—22N0.—A constant and fatal error with play-mongers is
to imagine that there arc themes, within the scope of their
intelligence, which can appeal at once to the gilded Semite of the
Stalls and the School Board alumni of the gallery. I say they
have no single sentiment of 'pleasure in common. At times
they are bored by the same things, but interested in the same
things never. It may satisfy Mr. KIPLING'S sense of the realities
to assert that " the Colonel's lady and Mrs. O'GRADY " (on the
strength) " are sisters under the skin." But, to take him on
his own restricted lines, I happen myself to have made a
study of armies (see my Arms and the Man), and I differ from
him fearlessly and without pity.
23RD—25TH.—I have little sympathy for the writer who is
lured from the strait road of Art by a passion for pedantic
consistency in the general purposes, if any, of his drama. I
hesitate to quote myself as a brilliant example of the contrary
method; but I still think it was a happy thought to put my
most modern criticisms into the mouth of a contemporary of
OCTAVIAN; and another, though not quite so happy, to assign
the exposition of my best twentyflrst-century philosophy (for
it will take till then for the public to apprehend me) to a
"Devil's Disciple " of the eighteenth. I may have faults, but
a taste for academic purity is not one of them.
26TH.—Nor do I pretend to say beforehand whether any given
play of mine is intended for a tragedy or a farce. I choose to
leave this matter to the audience to decide, having a rooted
belief in the subjective plasticity of all great work. I have
known my sentiments elicit laughter when 1 had privately antici-
pated tears; and I have seen the house divided, pit from stalls,
as to which of these two receptions should be accorded to a
speech of which the intention was equally ambiguous to myself.
In the game of poker, as I am given to believe, the most
brilliant artists are those who play without any settled
principles of their own, thus permitting their motives to escape
observation. Misunderstand yourself, if you would make
doubly sure of a position as one of the Great Misunderstood.
27TH.—I merit, of course, the abuse of the critics, who find
themselves at a loss to arrange their labels on accepted lines;
and the public is inclined to grow captious through inability to
confirm their suspicions of an underlying sense in my plays;
but without some guarantee of popular disfavour. One
trembles to imagine what will become of one's hesitating
self-esteem.
28TH.—To the great Artist there is always something ine-
briative in urisuccess; and though there may be danger of
over-exultation induced by a run of splendid failures, it isi
better to perish this way than to die, as some successful
authors have died, of a fatty degeneration of the brain.
29TH TO SlST.—In conclusion I would join issue with those
rash intellects that have assigned to me, thus early, a per-
manent seat among the Immortals. Admitted that I have the
advantage of SOPHOCLES and GOETHB in enjoying a wider range
of vision, I am very little, if at all, their superior in point of
actual genius. But in my own case, as in theirs, I protest
against the indefinite survival of reputations. The ages should
always advance from great to greater, as their purview of
humanity largens. And if this little collection of homilies
should avail to check that tendency to Cock-Shawolatry which
threatens, among the chosen few, to perpetuate my claims as
an Authority, neither I nor my readers will rightly grudge the
pains we shall severally have expended upon it. O. 3.
AN ODE.
TO AN OLD FAVOURITE.
[It is maintained that the ".shooting "of corns on the approach of damp
weather is due to the rapid formation of protective tissue, a provision of
Nature dating back to a period ieveral thousand centuries before boota were
invented.]
COME, shall I now address, or rather, dress thee,
Companion of my waking, dreaming hours?
How may I best in fitting terms express thee,
Life-long curtailer of my walking powers,
One that, though trodden on, art yet my master,
Reverse of friend that sticketh closer than a—plaster!
I '11 sing an ode, for though I 'm far from doting
Upon an ancient nuisance such as you,
I see you 're white-washed—here I 'm freely quoting
The April North American Review,
Where Dr. Louis ROBINSON discourses
About the common human callus and its sources.
Our ancestors in every sort of weather
Were forced to hunt, ho says, for food each day.
All innocent of manufactured leather,
Their pushful feet were shod in Nature's way;
Which cuticle, whene'er the glass said " Rainy,"
Would grow and thicken with an instinct really brainy!
Thus were they soled and heeled, and willy-willy,
• With automatic and impromptu boots,
Whose " vascular and sensitive papilhe"
Still linger with one when a pet corn shoots,
And, active through millenniums, are transmitted
To punish those who with degenerate shoes are fitted.
Let us be soothed—this extra sole-material
That on one's nerves will now and then impinge
And make one hobble at a pace funereal
Is, after all, a Prehistoric Twinge;
"I'is but a miracle of atavism
When clouds impending give your toe a paroxysm!
So then, my pet, my venerable relic
Descended from a spacious unshod age,
I '11 bear you still with temper that's angelic,
Nor vex you, as of old, with bootless rage;
My aneroid 's "Set Pair," and hence the reason
For close-time to your shooting and my game-leg season!
A. A. 8.

BANK HOLIDAY—AND AFTER.
(Page ]rom a Holiday-maker'a Diary.)
Monday.—The usual thing; up to twelve
noon know it. After then, suppose it.
Tuesday.—Resting a bit after yesterday.
High old time. But rather a head this
morning. But what's the odds so long
as you're happy? And happy I was—no
error.
Wednesday.—Still a bit off colour. Can't
be expected at the works. Leastways, if
I am, why, they can "continue the move-
ment"—as they say in the Volunteers
—and go on expecting.
Thursday.—Why, it seems ages since
Monday. Just beginning to feel the rest.
Wonderful fixture, bank holiday. Quite
leaves a fixed impression.
Friday.—Wonder how things are going
at the works. Expect nothing much. Know
all my pals won't have turned up yet. It
can't be all work and no play. Bank holi-
day doesn't come often.
Saturday.—The six days gone! Well,
done so before. And as to work. Well,
I must think seriously about it next week.
PEOPLE WHO PALL ON ME.
HI.—THE GIRL WHO DOTES ON LITERATURE.
I MEET her constantly during that
period of storm and stress known as the
London Season. At other times she
haunts the various Spas (in filial atten-
dance on various Pa's) so persistently,
that in a moment of verbal aberration, I
once termed her the hydro-headed mon-
ster. It was rude of me; but I find that
taking the waters dilutes my naturally
excellent temper.
I feel sure that she hasn't the least
regard for—or the faintest inkling as to
what constitutes—literature in reality.
That is the annoying part. But you can't
tell her so (unless you 're a brute), and
this makes it more annoying still.
As a rule, it is only the very latest book
that interests her. And she gets it up—
to use an uncouth expression—just like
other girls "get up" Bridge or Ping
Pong. It promises to be fashionable for a
while, and serves to enrich one's small
talk. It's—well, Mudie-flcent, but it isn't
literature.
Sometimes, however, this girl has been
known to patronise the Classics. She may
have had a ticket for a literary dinner,
and thinks she will be called upon to
discuss, say, SHELLEY during the INI
course, and SCHOPENHAUER while toying
with the savouries. Then, with a recollec-
tion of the way in which she "did" the
Art-treasures of Italy in ten days, she
will rush through the literary galleries o:
the Immortals with an anxious eye flxec
upon some popular literary guide so as to
find what she oitijht to think about these

SO SWEET OF HER!
Mrs. Chatterleigh. "FANCY, DEAR, AT THE BROWNS' LAST NIGHT THEY WERE ALL SAYING
HOW GLAD THEY WERE TO HEAR YOU WERE AT LAST ENGAGED! OF COURSE I DIDN'T
BELIEVE THE REPORT, DEAR, AND SAID I WONDERED ANY ONE COULD BK SO STUPID AS TO
IMAGINE ANYTHING SO ABSURD!"
"dear poets" and "dreadfully clever"
philosophers.
Perhaps this lady is the most trying
when she knows a real live poet. I
wonder he "s alive—but then, perhaps, the
acquaintance is not very close. Unless
you wish to be put down as an intellectual
pariah, you mustn't say you never heard
of him before. A few pertinent questions
will doubtless enlighten you as to who
this genius is. Probably your old friend
Occ. VERSEMAN, who once published a
volume at the earnest request of himself.
But don't disturb her simple faith. Let
her think the itinerant musician is a dis-
guised nobleman.
The language which this lady speaks is
common to all with a bent for gush. Her
conversation may be described as a sac-
charine sea strewn with adjectival and
adverbial wreckage. Useless to im-
press upon her that wise proverb "All
that's published is not sold." To this
doting damsel print is but a synonym for
fame. It may be puerile: yet, what is
dotage but second childhood.
HONOUR MEASURE.
TWENTY years of public service equal
a paragraph in the papers.
Two paragraphs in the papers equal a
leading article in a journal of standing.
Four leading articles equal the freedom
of a provincial city.'
Three freedoms of provincial cities
equal a banquet of honour in London.
Two banquets of honour in London
equal a dozen speeches at the openings of
bazaars.
Four dozen openings of bazaars equal
an occasional paragraph in an outer sheet.
One paragraph once a month in an outer
sheet equals public neglect.
Six months of public neglect equal
oblivion.

CULTURED CONVERSATIONS.
II.—ARTISTIC.
SCENE.—The Academy, on fine day the end of May. Captain
DORMER, who "knows wliat he likes," but doesn't under-
stand pictnres, is being told what he ought to admire by
Mrs. ONSLOW, who, though demure, is very decided, and
shows a feeling of responsibility as to the weight of her
judgment. Captain DORMER is cheery and docile, and
anxiously agrees with Mrs. ONSLOW before she lias given her
opinion.
Mrs. Onslow (in front of portrait of the Misses Wertheimer).
Oh I I 'in sure this must be a SARGENT. Do look, Captain
DORMER.
Captain Dormer (bewildered). A sergeant—this isn't a mili-
tary picture—it's two girls. Ah! (Catching sight of name.)
Yes, I see what you mean, of course. Anyone can tell that—
SARGENT ! good Heavens,—yes! At a glance. Now, don't you
think that's rather [Undecided pause.
Mrs. O. (quickly and decidedly). I do, indeed I
Captain D. (relieved). So do I! Do you suppose, now, that
vase is meant as an advertisement for the curios, and so on—
old China? I must say, these two ladies are really
Mrs. O. You 're perfectly right. (They pass on, Captain
DORMER wondering what on earth their opinion of the picture
is, exactly. In front of " Intercepted Letter," by FRITZ.)
Captain D. (really interested). I say, do you know, I call this
rather capital. But what on earth is the Johnnie in such a
rage about? Awful shame, poor little woman! Why, anyhow,
you can see she's been doing a bit of knitting. There can't
be much harm in her. I 'in afraid you don't like it.
M?'s. 0. I regard it as mere reporting. Scarcely a picture
at all.
Captain D. Indeed I By Jove—and I thought the great point
in a picture was to tell a story. Of course it ought to stand out,
too; I love a picture that stands out well. [DouM/!<i pause.
Mrs. O. Yet, many critics think one should look at the subject
of a picture as though a window. You often hear the expres-
sion "well in the picture," don't you?
Captain. So you do—I suppose. Now, what price this? I
mean, what is your feeling about this portrait of Mrs. RUSSELL?
SARGENT again, I see.
Mm. O. Most interesting!
Captain D. What's that sort of silvery thing, an egg-boiler,
or a Greek lamp—or what? Rum thing to put in a picture.
Mrs. 0. Don't you see, it's just to give a note of brightness—
to "egayer" (as the French say) the picture?
Captain D. (illuminated). By Jove! I say, how deep these
chaps are, aren 't they? Well, I think this is a jolly good exhi-
bition, although the pictures off the walls, Mrs. ONSLOW
Mrs. 0. Let us look at the statuary. Oh, how beautiful this
frieze is I I simply worship metal work. Don't you?
Captain D. Metal work, eh? Yes, it's rather jolly. A bit
cold, though. (After thought) Perhaps that's why they call
it a freeze. Do you think so?
Mrs. O. (laughing). How you cling to the old humour.
Captain D. Humour ? 1 didn't know I 'd made a joke; but it's
all right, if you like it Let's sit down a bit; I 'm sure you 're
tired.
(They rest in front of a landscape.)
Captain D. (tierroiislj/.) Er—how jolly it would be if we were
Hitting under that tree, wouldn't it? It looks awfully jolly,
don't you think so? (Ulight pause) And so well drawn too!
Mrs. O. The colouring of Yseult by FRANK DICKSEE—is
beautiful—so warm and glowing
Captain D. Yes, 1 daresay, but (frankly) she's not my style.
Mrs. O. Isn't she, indeed? (rising). Well, thank you so much
fur taking me round. I feel I've not seen half—but that's
really the best way, you know—
Captain D. (quickly). You mean, to do it in time. Yes; I
shall l>e delighted to come again, if you will. Fond of the—a—
Old Masters?
Mrs. O. I adore them. Which are your favourites?
Captain D. (thought/till]/). Isn't there a chap called JONES—
something JONES? Oh, no; he writes plays, doesn't he? Well
—(suddenly) oh, yes; RAPHAEL, and all those fellows. Splendid!
Nothing like it here, is there?
Mrs. 0. What a charming thing this is of Venice.
Captain D. Yes—and the Viennese, I believe, are so very
nice. [A. pause.
Mrs. O. Fond of pastels?
Captain D. Can't say I am. I hate those perfumed burning
things. Must you go now? Well, we'll go to the Classical
'oncert on Saturday, won't we, Mrs. ONSLOW? AM revoir /
[He puts her in a hansom and walks down Piccadilly, feeling
his tone has been raised but his spirits a little depressed.
THE SEASON.
Lo, it's the season 1 The talk is of marriages,
Maidens and bachelors made into one;
Dowagers driving in all sorts of carriages,
Resolute Benedicks watching the fun.
Band-boxy, up-to-date, deucedly pretty girls,
Breezy old bucks who date back to the Ark;
Guardsmen who chaff and are chaffed by the witty girls—
Guardsmen are always in place in the Park.
Dinners and dances—we take them all dashingly—
Staircases happily crowded with girls.
Snowy white shoulders, and golden hair flashingly
Gleaming and glancing with diamonds and pearls.
Music that swings you and makes you feel supple, too,
Bliss for your partner and rapture for you;
Fans made for one that can cover a couple, too;
Nooks for the lucky ones sitting it through. «
Now we can eye with an air supercilious
Countrified cousins at function and show;
Smile while their vigorous bands Piccadilly us
In to the pictures or out to the Row.
Catalogued, ardent, they throng the Academy,
Prattle with pleasure or shudder with shocks,
Startled by nudities Bvy or Adamy,
Thrilled by the portraits of children in frocks.
Ladies-with curls (and a patent for curling 'em),
Men with moustaches and looking their best,
See how they vanish in hausoms to Hurlingham,
All irreproachably booted and dressed.
Sweet tetes-a-tetes that mean much without saying it,
Lawns of cool grass that invite you to stroll;
Ponies and polo and prodigies playing it,
Turning and charging and striking for goal.
Then we go whirliug^that 's always the way we go—
Off after dinner to HAWTHEY or MAUDE;
Starched, patent-leathered and black to the play wo go;
Some of us laugh while the others applaud.
Some of us think that our plays are too clever now,
Some of us hold that the drama is dead.
Some swear by ROBERTS, who 's better than ever now;
So to our supper, and then to our bed.
Yes, it's the season ! our time for frivolity I
Off with our troubles for once in a while 1
See with a ripple of jesting and jollity
Smoky old London breaks out in a smile 1
Racketings, jauntings and innocent devilry,
Hearts beating madly, but always in tune,
Playtime and pleasure and rushes of revelry—
That is the way of the season in June I R. C. L.

A GOOD BEGINNING.
Gipsy Fortune-teller, "Pammr GENTLEMAN, YOU WILL HAVE LUCK TO-DAY!"
ODE BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT seems almost a pity to have given forth The Further Memoirs
oj Marie Bashkirtseff (GRANT RICHARDS). There is so little in this
collection except her letters to GUY DB MAUPASSANT which could
add anything to the extraordinary wonder of daring self-revela-
tion produced by her "dear diary" of a few years back. On
reading these scrappy memoirs one is inclined to question whether
this strange girl genius would have ever attained the heights
to which she aspired. Her one ardent prayer was to be a star.
But it was with short meteoric brilliancy that she just flashed
across the Parisian firmament and then sadly vanished, leaving
a memory of complex fascinations. Her short correspondence
with GUY DE MAUPASSANT is bright with girlish conceits and
admiration, a strong contrast to that decadent author's affecta-
tion of boredom. MARIE BASIIKIKTSEPF reveals herself as a
conflicting mixture of small vanities that is surprising in such
an ambitious nature, till one remembers her youth, and then
these little oddities of character make her individuality deci-
dedly more convincing, and one takes her as a girl utterly out
of the common, a problem to bo studied.
RICHARD MARSH wastes very little time on unnecessary
description, no matter how strong the temptation to wander
from the straight path of story-telling may be. In his novel of
Mrs. Musgrave and her Husband (JOHN LONG) he has given a
strange tale, and, as it appears to the Baron, a decidedly
original one. So death-dealing is he in this tragedy that he
seems to have said to himself, "Reason thus with Life; If I
do lose thee I do lose a thing Which none but fools would keep,
A breath thou art," and so five of his characters, including an
innocent babe, are deprived of their power to "carp vital
airs." The story is of the De Lunatico Inquirendo order, and
more than this, as in a wink darkly, the Baron may not hint.
Coincidence that the author of this so-to-speak Broadmoorish
tragedy should be a " Marsh." The proverb as to the insanity
of certain hares refers to those of the Marsh, not, as so often
and always erroneously quoted, "a March hare." The Baron
begs to introduce Mrs. Musgrave and her Husband to his friends.
A Woman Derelict (JOHN LONG), by MAY CHOMMEUN, is the
story of a woman who, after a great shock, has lost her
memory, much as did the Count in The Cigarette Maker's
Romance, and who recovers it in a somewhat similar fashion.
The novel lacks the tender charm of MARION CRAWFORD'S story,
and the reader's interest in the heroine, which is aroused to a
certain pitch of puzzlement by the style of narration involving
the striking use of italics almost as freely employed as they
were in very early nineteenth-century novels, soon flags and
would gradually die out were it not revived by the introduction
of a dramatic situation of which, however, nothing particular
comes, as, after a considerable waste of existence, the un-
fortunate heroine, who, when " a little wanting," might either
have become the wife of her affectionate doctor (if he hadn't
happened to have a crazy Jane of a wife still living), or who
might, on recovering her memory, have rejoined her loving
husband (had he not quietly married again and been blessed
with a child), comes to an Untimely but most opportune end.
So Majeste L'Amour, by MAX O'RKix (CALMANN LEVY, Paris),

Englishman, for a Londoner especially. MAX O'RELL is as fair
aa it is possible for a foreigner to be when criticising the
"tricks and the manners" of any other country but his own
MAX O'RELL knows his England and his London better than do
most Frenchmen; he is a keen observer, has genuine humour,
and as a •writer he is very amusing, because he refuses to take
anything seriously. Well does he say, " Pour Ja matrone bri-
tannique lea mots francais et immoral aont synonymes; mais je
vous assure que lea Anglais inteltigents se moquent de cette dame
tout autant que nous." MAX O'RELL knows his bourgeois bri-
tannique so perfectly, and his bourgeoise too, that it is sur-
prising, to the Baron at least, how so sharp-sighted and so
keen-witted a writer is unable to avoid the ordinary pitfalls
into which a foreigner writing about England and the English
[and in a general way represented by Count Smorltork in
Pickwick, who stays here "Long—ver' long—time, fortnight
more "] invariably tumbles headforemost. Occasionally one is
puzzled to know whether he is being uncommonly satirical at
the expense of intelligibility, as, for example, when he writes
"En Angleterre, la belle-mere n'est pas le sujet de plaisanteries
aussi ameres qu'en France. La raison eat toute simple. La

expense do our English dramatists, our satirical artists, our
song and novel writers, invariably obtain a laugh, if not
at that of the Mother-in-law? It it were not so, how comes it
that the English so thoroughly appreciate the belle-mere in
French farces? However, this is only a chance sample, but of
such mistakes as an Englishman of similar calibre to MAX O'RELL
would make, were he, after long residence in France, to give
his impression of French men and women, especially Parisians.

THE DISEASE OF GENIUS.
[All genius, according to medical materialism, may be accounted for by
abnormal physical conditions.]
Chorus of Aspirants.
FILLED with all-expectant yearning
To the door of light and learning
Where the lamp of truth is burning
Eagerly we flock;
And with breathless expectation
Here we hhmbly take our station
While upon his habitation
Venture we to knock.
Enter Medico-Materialist.
Incarnate Wisdom, hail!
Before thy learned brow
Thy servants do not fail
To bow;
Without thy aid we can't
Accomplish our affair—
Incarnate Wisdom, grant
Our prayer!
M. M. Rise, gentlemen, and tell me who ye be,
And what it is that ye would ask of me.
Chorus. Aspirants to fame are we,
Anxious all to leave a name
That shall ever honoured be
On the roll of fame.
Some to letters, some to art,
Some to politics aspire;
Some would play a SHAKSPEARE'S part,
Others SAPPHO'S lyre.
Teach us how we each may rise
To such enviable state—
Thou, in whom all knowledge lies,
• Teach us to be great I
M. Af. Friends, I will teach you. First remember, please,
That genius is simply a disease.
Chorus. Disease!
M. M. Undoubtedly. It indicates
Abnormal, extraordinary states.
You doubt me? Could an ordinary fellow
Have written plays like Hamlet and Othello?
Chorus. No indeed 1 No indeed!
We are healthy and sane,
But we all are agreed
"Twouldn't enter our brain
To write such a play as Othello, King Lear, or Hamlet the
Dane.
M. M. Well, if ordinary mortals write their ordinary plays
In their ordinary language and their ordinary ways,
There must be some abnormal cause, it's very clear to us,
Accounting for the symptoms of abnormal genius.
For the secret of CARLYLH'S success we needn't travel far;
The symptoms clearly indicate duodenal catarrh;
Redundant cerebellum caused the wisdom of old Solon,
While Fox's Martyrs indicate a much disordered colon.
The busts of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE that Italians make for us
Without a doubt suggest a case of hydrocephalus;
The diseases of the moderns I 'd swear to on the Bible,
It it weren't for the terribly expensive law of libol.
Chorus. Then, learned Sir, we gather that without
Disease we never can be great?
M. M. No doubt.
Tell me the bent of each one's aspirations,
And I '11 at once prepare inoculations.
They may, of course, prove fatal, but we '11 chance it.
Just wait a moment while I fetch my lancet.
[Exit M. M.
Chorus. Wo! wo! Where shall we go?
What are we in for? I 'm sure I don't know—
All the diseases
This gentleman pleases
To put in our bodies to prosper and grow.
Of course it is splendid to write problem plays,
And to reap a fair harvest of shekels ami praise;
While, if we keep healthy,
We'll never grow wealthy,
But still be mere nobodies all of our days.
And yet if disease is the sine qua iwn
That glory and fame are dependent upon—
Hark! hark! We can hear him
Concocting his serum!
Perhaps, on the whole, we had better be gone.

THE MORE THAN USUALLY GAY
SOLDIER AT ISLINGTON.
EVERYONE is delighted when the Agri-
cultural Hall at Islington is occupied by
the gallant performers who have made
the Royal Military Tournament one of the
most popular features of the entertain-
ments of the year. Directors may come
and directors may go, but " the combined
display '' goes on for ever. The musical
drive, too, is a source of intense pleasure
to thousands. When the Life Guards and
the Lancers dance about on their horses
to the tunes of the band, even the oldest
spectator forgets to regret the faded
glories of ASTLEY'S Amphitheatre. Then
there are the real contests—sword against
bayonet, lance against lance—all useful
and, to put ifc technically, to the point.
Everything so far excellent—very good.
But—alas that there should be a but—
there is an innovation this year that is
scarcely an improvement. Quite the best
thing of the shows of other days was the
dignity of Captain DANN, Master of the
Ceremonies. Had the gallant officer been
in a civilian circus he would have possibly
had to unbend to the clown, and act as
a ring-master. And this is what the
Captain was seemingly invited to do on
a recent occasion. Surely this was a
mistake. If comic relief must be intro-
duced, it would be well to let the drill
take its proper place in the exorcise
book. For instance, something of this
might be permitted.

Comic squad drill. To produce a mirth-
provoking grimace.
At the caution of the Instructor, "Pre-
pare to grin," the recruit will bring his
right eyebrow sharply up to the level of
the lobe of his left ear. At the' word
"Two," he will raise the corners of his
mouth and drop the eyelid over his left
eye, sharply bringing it back again,
judging his own time. At the word
"Three," he will exclaim, "Ha, ha, ha!"
and stand steady.
If the comicalities of the ring were
regulated in the manner suggested, all
would bo, if not quite well, at least
much better. As it is, the comic relief
is a little out of hand and requires
discipline.
For the rest, Islington is as merrio if
not merrier than of yore. The audiences
come in their tens of thousands to secure
enjoyment and to assist in a work of
charity. So, take it all round the circle,
there is nothing demanding complaint.

"ESCAPED once again!" panted the
bondsman, as with a faithful band of
followers ho disappeared into the bush.
"Save us from this new despotism!"
cried his lieutenant, who, having had the
advantage of a British education, was
more intelligent than the rest. "We are
not fit, O Master, to bo turned away
from our homes and a condition of irre-
sponsibility to earn by cruel hard work
our living."
A deep roar of applause was. the con-
firmation of the statement.
"Silence !" shouted the bondsman in a
whisper. "Silence, or we shall be dis-
covered. Not five minutes since, wo were
in danger of being taken and forcibly
deprived of that protection which those
idiota from London call ' slavery' because
they don't in the least understand the
situation."
"Wo will never give up our shackles,"
said a maiden. "They are quite the fashion
as bangles."
"And to think that, at the bidding of
shouters in an obscure hole known as
Exeter Hall, we should give up the
absolute comfort of protection to the
brutal uncertainty of bosh called 'free-
dom ' is too absurd!"
Again it was the lieutenant who had
had the advantage of an English eduea-
ion who was the speaker.-
At this moment the sound of martial
music was wafted into the bush.
"Ah, I know that hateful tune," cried
the bondsman. "Yes, there goes the
idiotic refrain, 'Britons, never, never,
never will be slaves!' I consider it
rubbish!"
"And so say all of us," replied the
lieutenant. "Britons never will be
slaves. But ice will!"
And with this determination the ex-
cited band continued their escape froDi
freedom by hurrying through the bush.

And pondered deep inexorable time.

And Time's remorseless fingers had

Closed on his throat, amid the City's

But hero where gentle zephyrs fanned the

And Nature overspread with bounteous

Her tranquil splendours, hither had he

Where boldly ho the stretch of Time could

Where extradition treaties were un-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HOKKIBLE IMBKOGLIO.
AM I engaged to EVELINA TREMAYNE, or
am I not?
That is the question which I have been
asking myself for the past six weeks, and
I seem to be as far from learning the
answer to it as ever.
Six weeks ago I proposed to EVELINA on
a sudden impulse.
I am an impulsive
man. But whether
she accepted my
suit or rejected it
I do not know, and
I find this condi-
tion of uncertainty
peculiarly galling.
It came about in
this way. A month
previously I had
met EVELINA down
in Surrey. It was
at the FARRING-
DON8' dance. She
waltzed divinely
and wore pink.
Soon afterwards
she came up to
stay with her
grandmother in
Regent's Park.
Before I had seen
her a dozen times
I had discovered
that life without
her would be
worthless, and one
morning I wrote to
her from my cham-
bers in the Temple
asking her to be
my wife.
Now mark the ma-
lignity of things.
I had hardly sent
off that letter when
I was summoned
to Brighton on
business which
might take three
or four days. As
Mrs. TRIPPETT is
rather care less
find her completely recovered. She was
much offended when she learned the
reason of my visit, and in order to pro-
pitiate her I agreed to run over to Llan-
dudno to see a tenant of her's who
wanted some repairs done to the roof of
his house. Both at Brighton and at Tor-
quay I filled up forms instructing the
postal authorities to forward letters.

THE
TWOPENNY TUBE."
"Ht, GUV'NOR, THERE AIN'T NO STATION NAMED os TBU TICKST!"
"No; ALL OUU TICKETS ARK ALIKE."
"THEN, 'ow DO 1 KNOW WHERB I'M OOIKO!"
about sending on
my letters, I went to the Post
in Fleet Street before leaving
Office
town,
and filled up a form, ordering all letters
to be forwarded to my address at Brighton.
In this way I felt that I should receive
EVELINA'S letter with the least possible
delay.
My Brighton business took less time
than I had anticipated, and I was on the
point of returning to London next morn-
ing when I ran across Uncle BowKEit at
the station. He informed me, with tears
in his eyes, that Aunt EMILY was at the
point of death at Torquay. I need not
say that I hurried to her side, only to
Having transacted Aunt EMILY'S busi-
ness at Llandudno, I returned next day
to Town, after filling up a final form
ordering all letters to be sent after mo
to London.
By that seemingly harmless act, 1 cut
myself off entirely from the blessings of
the penny post! No letters, either from
EVELINA or from anyone else, ever reach
me now. They are addressed to me in
London. London forwards them to
Brighton, Brighton to Torquay, Torquay
to Llandudno, Llandudno to London,
London to Brighton again. At no point
do they ever reach me. By some hideous
accident I seem to have hit upon the
secret of Perpetual Motion, and my
letters—EVELINA'S among the number—are
doomed to revolve, planet-fashion, round
the watering-places of England and Wales
to all eternity. As things stand at pre-
sent, I am as completely isolated from
correspondence as ALEXANDER SELKIRK.
I have inquired in vain at the Fleet
Street Post Office,
and even at St.
Mar tin's-1 e-G rand,
for a form, by the
filling up of which
I may break the
spell which im-
prisons my letters,
but no such form
exists. Meantime,
the number of che-
ques, invitations,
and bills revolving
on their orbits in-
stead of being de-
livered to me
grows daily
greater, and none
of them, save the
cheques, can I
"stop." This, for
obvious reasons, I
do not wish to do.
When I first re-
turned to Town,
and no letters
reached me, I did
not dream that
anything was
wrong. After wait-
ing a day or two,
therefore, for a
line from EVELINA,
I decided that her
reply must have
miscarried and
wrote again, say-
ing, that I feared
her answer must
hdve been "lost
in the Post." I
little knew how
completely "lost
in the Post" it
was! When, how-
ever, no reply
curne to this second letter I became uneasy,
and when no letters reached me at all from
any quarter, I began to realise the ter-
rible predicament in which I was placed.
My letters were hurtling round the sea-
side resorts of Great Britain instead of
being quietly delivered at my Chambers
in the Temple, and even the Postmaster-
General was incapable of arresting their
flight!
My first idea, when I perceived what
was happening, was to write EVELINA a
note asking whether wo wore engaged
or not, and begging her to reply by bearer.
But the question looked so preposterous

on paper, that 1 had not the courage to
send it. .
Then I thought of driving round to
Regent's Park and making the enquiry in
person. But the practical difficulties
seemed insuperable. The. demeanours of
a rejected suitor and an accepted lover are
•widely different, and try as I would, I
failed to hit on a compromise •which should
combine the characteristics of both.
Lastly, I had a scheme of putting the
question frankly to some friend of both of
us; but my vanity shrank from the task,
and I reluctantly abandoned it..
And now, to intensify the difficulties of
my position, EVELINA and her grandmother
have gone abroad for some weeks, and as
I have not their address — if we are
engaged, it is doubtless in one of those
letters which have been sucked into the
vortex of my correspondence—all possi-
bility of interrogating either of them is
for the moment, at an end.
The worst of it is, I have no longer the
slightest desire to be engaged to EVELINA.
On the contrary, the sufferings of the
past few weeks have made the idea
positively distasteful to me. Moreover,
less than a fortnight ago I met DOROTHY
SINCLAIR at a garden party, and now I
feel that only with DOROTHY can I ever be
happy. She has blue eyes, and plays
croquet adorably. I have seen her several
times since, and nothing would give me
greater pleasure than to ask her to be
mine. But so long as I do not know
whether I am engaged to EVELINA or not,
I cannot possibly propose to DOROTHY.
And so long as I cannot get hold of
EVELINA'S letters I cannot discover
whether we are engaged.
From this horrible imbroglio there
seems to be no way of escape. Moreover,
EVELINA does not return from abroad for
five weeks, and as DOROTHY starts with
her father for India in three, it is
tolerably clear that unless the Post Office
consents to disgorge my correspondence
—which it shows no symptoms of doing—
DOROTHY will be half way across the
Indian Ocean before I can personally iu-
tefview EVELINA and discover whether
I am free to propose to anyone else.

SOCIAL ASTRONOMY.
Celestial Note* from a very Future Number
of a Society Journal.
[" OF late years total eclipses have tended more
and more to lw social functions. In fact, celestial
phenomena, which were formerly ignored us vulgar
proceedings, conducted by astronomers and other
mechanics, have now the honour of being witnessed
by really smart people."—St. Jameft Gaittte.]
IT is feared that the partial eclipse of
the sun will attract few, if any, of the
really smart people this year owing to its
falling on Ascot week. This clashing of
dates appears, from all accounts, to have
been unavoidable. However, it is ex-
pected that those mainly responsible for
the organizing of this astronomical enter-
tainment will include in their bill of fare,
comestibles of a lighter order than usual
in deference to the taste of the multitude
who will be desirous of supporting the
enterprise with their presence.
Parties are' already being made up to
witness the shadow which crosses the sun
on the 14th prox. It is particularly
fortunate coming immediately before the
Dumpletown Races, as the hosts of pretty
frocks which are always a feature of this
exclusive little meeting, or will have a
preliminary airing, so to speak, on the
14th. Lady SAGITTARIUS and the Hon.
STELLA POLARIS are included in the house
party of the Marquis of SlRiUS, the genial
President of the Society of Astronomical
Entertainers.
Owing to Sir PYIADES ORION being out
of town the shower of shooting stars
fixed for next Wednesday will have to be
held over indefinitely. It is greatly to
be hoped Sir PYLADES will be able to fit
in this beautiful phenomenon with his
social arrangements, as it only takes place
once in thirty-three and a quarter years.
It is a thousand pities that the eclipses
of the moon, formerly among the most
prominent of popular functions of the
season, are to be discontinued owing to
lack of patronage. Sic transit gloria
lunae, one might exclaim. It is now over
fifty years since an eclipse of the moon
has been arranged in anything like a
satisfactory manner. It is an open secret
that the financial gain attached to these
lunar spectacles was anything but en-
couraging. Still, we cannot but deplore
the lapse of an ancient and time-honoured
custom, and can only hope that some
generous patron may be forthcoming from
our " old nobility," who will place future
eclipses on a firm financial basis.
"We understand that the enterprising
paper, The Daily Diddler, has made ar-
rangements for introducing to its readers,
and a specially invited body of scientic
gentlemen, a new and original comet.
Such of the millions of readers' of the
Diddler, as are desirous of participating in
this unique stellar offer, should send up
five coupons cut from current numbers of
the journal when they will be furnished
with a ticket entitling them to a seat in
the line of route. It is anticipated that
the comet will come into sight at the
Marble Arch about 10 a.m., and wend
its fiery way down Oxford Street, reach-
ing the Bank about noon. The proprietors
of the Daily Diddler wish it to Ixj dis-
tinctly understood that they do not hold
themselves responsible for the non -
appearance of the comet at the hour
advertised, or at all.

OCCASIONAL OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday, May 25.—A memorable night. The duel between
Herr KNOTK as Lohengrin and Herr MOHWINKKL as Telramtind
was about as near the real thing as it could be, with an entirely
novel and unrehearsed effect as poor Telramtind got such "a
nasty one" across the nose—(" Bridge" in it again!)—that
instead of falling, as is the jeu da scene familiar to all, he
suddenly staggered off, concealing the wound so effectually,
that, but for the apology made for him after the fall of the
curtain, few would have been aware of the accident. His
place was immediately and capably filled by Herr MUHLMANN,
who repeated his performance on the following Tuesday.
Wednesday, May 29.— Tantihauser in its native German.
Most satisfactory. All kept well in hand, orchestra included
but chorus excluded, by Herr LOUSE, whose motto is " if it were
done, t'were well it were done quickly."
Mile. STRAKOSCH, as Venus, attractive as the Venus of
Venusberg ought to be. Madame SOBKINO bright as the
Shepherdess, and Sir Tannhiiuser a masterpiece by Van DYCK.
Herr Van ROOY is the Broth of a Boy, Sings marvellous
well in German, And we raise our glass, In praise of Herr
BLASS, Who was very good as Hermann. But we turn off the
poetical tap and return to prose. After rather a surfeit of " the

EMMA EAMES as Elisabeth, of which we cannot have too much.
Thursday, May 30.—Memorable. Much ado about something.
First night of the STANFORD-SHAKKSPKARK-STURGIS, or the S.S.S.
Combination Opera Co. in four acts. Music composed by CHARLES
VILLIERS STANFORD (" Op. 76 "—whatever this may mean to the
cognoscenti, or "knowing ones"), to libretto by JULIAN SHAKE-
SPEARE and WILLIAM STLIRCIS. Let it be said at once, so as to
put the opera-going world in general, and the "S.S.S. Comb.
Op. Co." in particular, at their ease, that its success, on its
premiere, was undisputed, and that everyone interested in
British musical industry may sincerely congratulate composer,
librettists (including the " Divine WILLIAMS "), artistes, con-
ductor, manager, Syndicate, and in fact everyone concerned iu
the production.

comedy is evident from all that he has done in this direction
throughout Much Ado; but when he attempts low comedy, as in
»is orchestral jesting for the part of Dogberry, then what
might possibly be considered intensely humorous when "made
n Germany," must appear to an English audience as the merest
commonplace of farce and pantomime which would be appro-
priate when acaompanying the comicalities of DAN LEND,
IERBERT CAMPBELL and an acrobatic donkey on the stage of
Drury Lane at Christmas, with energetic Mr. Hand-and-Glover
leating the air in the orchestra.
Had Professor STANFORD, "Op. 76," slyly introduced the tune
of The Vicar of Dray, the cryptic jest might have been appre-
ciated by not a few of those on whom such exhibitions-of humour
ire never lost. Neither is this scene enlivened by Herr BLASS,
in operatic comedian evidently chosen for Dogberry on ac-
ount of three-fifths of his name suggesting (in English) the
Shakspearian clown whom he has to impersonate. It is in this
part of the Opera that librettist (possibly) and composer (cer-
tainly) have thrown away their chances. The idea of making
Verges a pantomimist, without a word to speak, may have seemed
exquisitely humorous until it came into action on the stage,
and then Verges is simply in the way, whereas, how suggestive
of a genuinely comic trio are Dogberry, Verges, and Seacoal!
Dismissing this Shakspearian farcical portion as the only mis-
take in the whole Opera and, remembering that he " who never
makes a mistake never makes anything," let us " cut the cackle
and come to the 'osses."
There is no overture; prelude; chorus commencing on stage
before rising of curtain. Prom this minute forward, all the
music is charming; but it flows on and on so melodiously, yet
always so rapidly, that, it being impossible to stem it (and
not for worlds would we dam it, cela va sans dire), we cannot
even stay it for a moment in order to obtain an encore
Consequently, sweet melodies and momentarily catching phrases
are swirled along one after the other, and there is nothing to
caught.
On comes that villain of deepest dye, Don John, dressed in
black, with white face, reminding me of the most melodramatic
villains with whom I have had the pleasure of being acquainted.
The general appearance of Mr. DUTTON in this part suggests
the idea of a vampire who has had rather a bad passage between
Dover and Calais. Mr. HYDE as Borachio (" ch" hard, so that an
inspired rhymester may not say, "Here comes Borachio With a
blackmoustachio," unless he spells it " moustarkio "), and Mr.
DUTTON manage to pronounce their English so cleverly that no(
a few intelligent persons in the stalls exclaim, "Hallo! why,
it's in Italian after all!"
Mr. DAVID BISPHAM, a Welshman presumably, also managed
to give this Italian effect to the plain English of JULIAN
SHAKESPEARE, otherwise his Benedick was in singing excellent,
and in acting a very clever reading of that eccentric Shak
spearian character who, though "officer and gentleman,'
yet has the rough-and-ready bearing of one who has risen from
the ranks and been taken up by II.R.H. Don Pedro of Arragor
(played unobtrusively by Mr. IVOR PoSTKR), to whom he
acts as a kind of Court Jester. For singing and acting, com
mend me to JOHN COATES, who, as Don Claudia, appeared to be a
a very gallant and most amiable " young lord of Florence."
Leonato, Governor of Messina, was efficiently represented by
Mr. PUTNAM GRISWOLD, who, though he had given the characte
white hair, yet had evidently considered him as a very young
man for his years, and in this style so.played him. It was
almost touching to see with what modest dignity he welcomec
his guests, carrying his timidity to such a pitch that, ir
addressing them from a raised dais, he appeared so bashful a
to be really unable to open his eyes. This was a genuin
artistic touch: Leonato had got his speech by heart, and an;
distraction might have put it out of his head.
SUZANNE ADAMS simply charming, in singing and acting, as th
heroine Hero, and Miss MARIE BRBMA will soon improve on he
rst-night performance of Beatrice, which even then left very
ttle, while her perfect singing left nothing, to be desired.
M. PLANQON always great as Jupiter, or good as a mediaeval
cclesiastic, came out dramatically and vocally strong as Friar
rancig. He, too, kindly sang in English (but then Frenchmen
re so polite), though he shied at the word "impediment,"
ubstituting "cause," and it was rather hard on him that
itr. STURGIS should have given to the French frerc the only
ine in the libretto that isn't of the "well of English pure and
undented," as, in answer to Claudia's prayer for pardon, his
Beverence is made by Mr. STURGIS, not by SHAKSPEARE, to
ay, "God pardon thee, and she thy hapless bride!" However,
t's all "much ado about nothing," and, also, "all's well that
;nds well." Good novel effect produced musically by combina-
ion of church bells, church organ behind scenes, orchestra,
vhile Beatrice and Benedick are duetting. The conduct of the
oy acolytes, who during this " extraordinary scene in a church,
at a wedding" remain impassable, Ts beyond all praise. Good
>oys these.
Time permits no more ado at present by yours truly. The
Opera should be given several times this season, and then take
ts place in the regular repertoire. Yet, after a first hear-
ng, when encores were not permitted, I cau only record a
generally pleasant impression of one "harmonious whole,"
,nd, therefore,
Surely this Opera hu come to stay,
Since nothing from it can one take away.
Any number of "calls" after every act. Did they "come
vhen they were called?" Aye, marry, did they! Professor
STANFORD holding on to Master STURGIS, and both kept in their
>roper places by being in the grip of the artists who, at another
ime, brought on MANCINELLI the Merry, when they all
advanced in a line as if they were going to do a real good dance
by way of a finish. But they didn't; perhaps they did after
the curtain was down, for they must have been thoroughly
satisfied with the success.
OVERLOOKED, NOT FORGOTTEN.
(An Extract from Military History.)
THEGeneral was very pleased. There was an excellent parade
of troops. All arms of the service were admirably repre-
sented. Cavalry, infantry, and artillery were all well to the
fore. Many of the men were young — growing lads. There
were others bronzed from service in the field. Medals
abounded, and good-conduct stripes were widely distributed.
"Excellent!" cried the General, as he examined the state.
"Nothing wanting. Plenty of Regulars?"
"Plenty, Sir," was the prompt reply.
"The Yeomanry in full force?"
"A very large number indeed, Sir."
"And the Volunteers — our gallant Volunteers—they have
responded to the call of duty?"
"Indeed they have, Sir." Then there was a pause. The
General seemed to be lost in thought.
"To make the army absolutely representative, I fancy we
should have a few of our old constitutional force. Are any
present? Of course, I mean our friends the Militia."
Again there was a slight pause. It was passed from rank to
rank that the Militia were absent. What had become of them?
"Well, really," exclaimed the General, "we must accounl
for the Militia." Then came a consultation, and after a brie
interval an answer to the question was forthcoming.
"If you please, Sir, the Militia are not on parade, Sir
because"
"Yes—because?"
"They are in South Africa, Sir, fighting for their King and
country." And the explanation was considered satisfactor;
by the General, and even more than satisfactory by the
remainder of the British Empire.

MR. PICKLETHORN'S CONTRIBUTION.
CHAPTER II.
In the editor's room of The Trumpet Magazine sat Mr.
HENDERSON, regarding an MS. which lay before him in a
manner which can only be described as savage. Against the
mantelpiece leaned Mr. BRADOATE, the sub-editor, looking
extremely uncomfortable—which was not to be wondered at,
for his chief had just been giving him a piece of his mind, and
on such occasions Mr. HENDERSON was not in the habit of
considering other persons' feelings.
"In the course of my experience," he remarked, "I have had
to read a great quantity of rubbish—but never, I assure you,
BRADQATE, never such quite unmitigated drivel as this!"
"I'm very sorry," said Mr. BRADUATE humbly. "Really, I
can't understand it at all. It is the most awful nonsense, as
you say. But are you bound to take it?"
"Thanks to
you," rejoined the
editor, " I suppose
I am. You came
to me full of a
humorous sketch
which this fellow
had written, and
which you assured
me was positively
brilliant.
"Yes," put iu
Mr. BRADGATE;
"it was in the
Charing Cross Re-
view, and it was
called 'A Novel
Revenge. '"
"And on the
strength of it, yon
persuaded me to
ask him to contri-
bute to our Christ-
mas Number.
Worst of all, you
were so despe-
rately keen on
getting him, that
you induced me—
quite contrary to
custom — to offer
him a rather fancy
price, and to send him half the amount in advance! And the
result is that he gives us drivel that would disgrace a school-
boys' paper. Really, BRADGATE, I thought you had more sense.
Of course, if he is really a friend of yours"
"He's nothing of the kind," said the sub-editor, with some
indignation. "I told you that I 'd never even heard his name
before, and I hunted out his address in the directory."
"Sure you didn't make some mistake about it?"
"Quite sure—it isn't a common name, and there was only
one JOSIAH PICKLETHORN in the Directory, so that"
At this moment the office-boy entered with a card, which he
banded to Mr. HENDERSON. "Gentleman wishes to see you,"
he said.
"By Jove!" cried the Editor, " it's the chap himself! Show
him in, Thomas. Now we'll have it out with him," he added to
the sub-editor. "Don't you go, BRADGATB—he's your protegt,
you know."
And in another minute, THOMAS reappeared, ushering in Mr.
JOSIAH PICKLETHORN, who shook hands warmly with Mr. HENDER-
SON as the Editor rose to greet him.
"Happened to be passing this way," he said, "so I thought
.--''tJL .c'l
,^r>\ ^>.^ i^* _ , .—^^r^}\\.

"A1.J.ANP.O
"GOING TO HEPSOM, BILL!"
"HEPBOM! THIS YEA.K I Nor ME I LOOK AT THE HINCOMK TAX!"
I 'd just drop iu and see whether you 'd got my story all
right."
"Yes, " replied the Editor frigidly, "we have your story, Mr.
PICKLETHORN."
"Ah, that's right. Then, if you don't mind, I '11 take along
that other seven-pound-ten with me. And, if you happen to
want a few more stories of the same sort, why, as I was telling
my wife this morning"
"One moment, Mr. PICKLETHOHN," interposed Mr. HENDERSON.
"I assure you wo want no more stories of the same sort. In
fact, I am greatly—very greatly—disappointed with the tale
you sent me."
"Eh?" exclaimed the author, with obvious surprise. "Dis-'
appointed, are you? How's that?"
"Surely, you must feel that it is such infinitely inferior work
"A Novel Revenge,' " supplied Mr. BRADOATE.
"Yes, 'A Novel
Revenge.' Inferior
to it in every
way I"
"That 's a inat-
a a
ter of taste, Sir,"
rejoined Mr. PIC-
KLETHORN. "For
my part, I think
that story of mine
couldn't easily be
beaten. Why, I
assure you"
At this juncture,
the office-boy
again entered with
a card.
"'Mr. RICHARD
SMITH,'" said the
Editor, reading it.
"Never heard of
him. You 'd better
see what he wants,
BRADGATE. Now,
Mr. PICKLETHORN,
I must be frank
with you. This
piece of work of
yours is wholly
unsuited to our
magazine, so I
must suggest that
we cancel our contract. Comparing it with ' A Novel Revenge,'
1 think"
"I don't care what you think," cried Mr. PICKLETHORN in
high wrath ; " but if you think I 'm :i fool,you are mistaken, and
that's all about it. Cancel the contract. Not likely! As to
that other story you keep on dragging in, not having read it"
"Not having read it! Why—Mr. PICKLETHORN—you wrote
it!"
"Look here, Sir," Mr. PICKLETHORN retorted; "not being a
literary man myself, I don't understand these games. Is it a
joke, or what?"
"A joke 1 " cried the astonished Editor. "D' you mean to say
you didn't write 'A Novel Revenge' in the C/mring Cross
Reaieiv ?''
"Most certainly not," replied Mr. PICKLETHORN. "Never
wrote a line in my life till"
The door burst open, and in rushed Mr. BRADGATE, followed
by a young man in a state of obvious surprise.
"Most extraordinary thing I "gasped the Bub-editor. "Look
here, HENDERSON, this is Mr. RICHAUD SMITH—and it's ho who
wrote 'A Novel Revenge !'"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"I don't understand," said the Editor, feebly, -with his head
between his hands. "I understood you to say that Mr. JOSIAH
PlCKLETHORN ''
"Yes ; but this gentleman wrote that story—his first, it seems
—over a pseudonym, and signed it JOSIAH PICKLETHORN."
The rightful owner of that name gasped, and turned fiercely
upon the stranger.
"Do I understand, Sir, that you deliberately stole a name—
stole my name—and attached it to your own miserable story?"
"I must apologise," said Mr. SMITH. "I am most
grieved"
"Apologise! D' you think an apology is enough for wilful
forgery?"
"Not wilful," Mr. SMITH protested. "May I explain?
When I 'd written my first story, 'A Novel Revenge' and it
was accepted, it occurred to me that I must take a nom-de-
pliime. Too many 'RICHARD SMITHS' about, you see. I tried
to think of an uncommon one, and, somehow—I suppose I roust
have seen it in a newspaper—the name 'JOSIAH PICKLETHORN'
came into my head. It seemed such an odd one that it was
just what 1 wanted."
"Such an odd one !" cried Mr. PICKLETHORN.
"So—er, out of the way—and distinguished; in fact, it never
occurred to me that there could be a real owner to the name.
I needn't add that I '11 use another pseudonym in future."
"You had better!" said Mr. PICKLETHORN, "Otherwise,
young man, you '11 find yourself in prison before you 're much
older."
"But you see now, Mr. PICKLETHORN," said Mr. HENDERSON,
who had been conferring in an undertone with his colleague,
"that there has been an absurd blunder, and that I wrote to
you under a misapprehension. Under the circumstances, I am
sure you will release me from the contract, and allow me to
return your manuscript to you."
"As you please," said the author. "If you're fool enough
not to use a really clever story—well, that's your look out."
"Very well then," resumed Mr. HENDERSON. "And that
cheque I sent you?"
The wrath on Mr. PICKLETHORN'S face gave way to a com-
placent chuckle. "It's cashed," he said. "I'll let you off
the other half; but if you think seven-pounds-ten is too much
for sitting up half the night writing—well, I differ from you,
that's all. And if you want it back, you 'd better sue this young
gentleman, who forged my name! "Well, I'11 be going. I don't
bear no malice, and if you should want one of my stories by-
and-bye, you can write; you know my address, anyhow!"
Mr. PICKLETHORN has not yet been asked, however, for
further contributions. But among his friends he now adopts
a tone of lofty patronage when speaking on literary topics.
"Very poor stuff it is," he said, criticising contemporary
flction. "Of course, I've no time to write myself. As a
matter of fact, though, one of the best magazines once asked me
to write a story for them, and sent me a cheque in advance."
At which remark his friends regard the sugar-broker rather
incredulously. But Mr. PICKLETHORN is telling the truth, all
the same! A. C. D.
THE DERBY, ACCORDING TO DARBY
JONES.
HONOURED SIR,—"Oh I who will o'er
the Downs so free?" sings the Bard once
beloved by the mellow-toned Boys who
warbled at Evans's in the GREEN old days
long ago. The Poet must assuredly have
been referring to the chalky Uplands of
Epsom for, as you are well aware, they are
unlike many parks and pleasaunces known
as Kempton, Sandown, Hurst and Lingfield,
as free to all Humanity as is the Atlantic
Ocean or the National Gallery. I confess,
Sir, that I have a great Regard for Epsom
on the Derby Day. It is a Cosmopolitan
Holiday, and if Mr. CARNKOIE, the cast-
iron King-Democrat were to entrust
Messrs. WEATHERBY with £5,000,000,
wherewithal to endow a Great Inter-
national Race without Entrance-fees,
Forfeits or payment of Riding-Money to
Jockeys it would not knock out the Top
Weight in the Turf Ring.
As my friend the Count says, "The
Derby is so easy to go to, and it is so easy
to get away from." The Count is a noble-
man of Singular Resourcefulness. For
instance, whenever he is going to decimate
the Grice in Caledonia, he invariably has
his Portmanteau labelled for Clapham
Junction. "You can get anywhere, my
friend," he says, "from Clapham Junc-
tion." So you can from Epsom, if the
Monetary Scales are tipped up against you.
This year I shall appear on the Hill on the
well-appointed Coach of my friend Mr.
DIGBY SLAPP, whose late lamented sire
made a fortune out of Patent India-rubber
Mourning Hatbands. DIGBY himself is far
from funereal, unless he be regarded from
the standpoint of an Hibernian Wake. His
motto is " Cash or Crash," and his favour-
ite colour Vermilion.
But a truce to these Meanderings; let
us to the Poesy of Business. Lord SALIS-
BURY and the Right Honourable JOSEPH,
to say nothing of Lord MILNER of St.
James's Street and Capetown House, have
their difficulties, but what are they to
those of a Scrutator into an Inscrutable
Mystery? Nevertheless, as the Gaul says,
"On Avong!" Here, therefore, goes :—
The Jfamleler leems to be fancied at home
But surely the Flowtrihape' v better.
Regal Red to the fore is not likely to come
Nor Disdainful be held an up-Better.
The Orange King may muke a bid for the lead
When Oreek Entrance it doing his best,
Sander's blossom will need a rare turn of speed
When Hotchpotch is put to the test.
The Town of Natal may run into a place,
But Calf-comfort is not one for me,
And the Curious Lord will not stride at a pace
That will do for the Lord with a Bee.
The Ready Hats off should be one of the three
Who will fight with the Jatc-breaking Pale,
But beware oh! beware of the Treasury Gee
When the foremost are nearing the goal!
So the Spirit of Divination has moved
me. I cannot do more than divine. I
have several Spirit-rapping friends; they
cannot do more. I have tried them. All
spirits seem woefully ignorant about
Horse Racing. If they were not, they
would be as popular as Scottish whiskey
in the opinion of
Your devoted henchman and heeler,
DARBY JONES.
P.S. — I presume, honoured Sir, the
same old spot under the Luncheon
Baskets—opposite the Grand Stand?
AN EXHORTATION.
(A suitable Preface for a Volume of Minor
Poetry.)
OH, do not ask that my attempt in rhyme
Shall in the highest spirit of poesy
Conceived be. Or that my muse with Time
Shall pace it out unto eternity.
But to each page thy gentle favour lend
And read my volume to the bitter end.
Oh, ask not how to publish this I dare!
Nor be thou over curious to know
If I who trill and twitter am aware
How hard the immortal trumpet is to
blow.
Thy kindly glances on my rhyming s;>ond
And try to read the volume to the end.
My passion all too precious is to find
A place in aught so cold as inky ode;
Nor any thoughts that may appoint iny
mind
Shall you expect released from their
abode.
Sana passion, feeling, thought thy way
shalt wend
These pages through unto the bitter end.
When SHAKSPEARE, MILTON, WORDSWORTH,
each hath proved
A dainty morsel for the tooth of Time
And mighty music leaves thy heart un-
moved,
Thou shalt bethink thec of my votive
rhyme.
And half in wonder, half in pity bend
Thine eyes upon these pieces—to what
end?
AN IMPRESSIONIST. — The burglar who
takes the wax model of a key.

ADDITIONAL ANTICIPATIONS.
(By R. Tesian Wells.)
AN eminent authority on the future is
writing in the Fortnightly Review a series
of "Anticipations"
of progress in
general during the
twentieth century.
He goes deeply
into the subject,
but he appears to
overlook the social
and unscientific
aspect of it. The
present writer, at
the risk of being
bored,has gone
even deeper.
Although he has
the same name, he
has no connection
•with the other
WELLS. That gen-
tleman is content-
ed •with digging
near the surface.
The present wri-
ter, enlisting the
aid of science,
pierces far lower,
and causes the
springs of know-
ledge to gush forth
from the hidden
rocks. Enough,
however, of these
personal matters.
Anyone can see
that everyone,
even at the pre-
sent day, is too
busy with work or
amusement to de-
vote much time to
reading the news-
papers. The most
modern journals,
therefore, use the
shortest sentences.
From this one may
safely conclude
that all the news-
papers of the latter
half of this cen-
tury will be writ-
ten in the style
introduced by the
telegraph, which
is far indeed from
the one introduced
by the .Telegraph. It is intended to
give, in these " Additional Anticipations,"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
THE ACTOK-MANAGER DISCOURSES,
ill.
MADAM, you must not count me cold of heart
Nor deaf to beauty's homage frankly paid,
If with an equal frankness I decline
That proffer of the soul's surrendered pride
Which is a credit to your natural taste
And shows you gifted with a fine contempt
For maiden modesty. It cannot be.
Yet I am mortal (in a way) and wear
No certain armour, any more than yon,
Against the stab of beauty, save alone
My solemn sense of service owed to Art.
But were I once to give my pity play, •
Once to allow my ruthless front to melt,
I dare not think what issues might evolve
From such a precedent.
Believe me, Madam,
Your case is not by any means unique.
Unnumbered missives, much the same as yours,
Breathing insidious scents of Araby,
Perfume my dressing-room. The nightly door,
Whence I debouch on my attendant brougham,
Reveals a wistful ambush on the watch.
To see the Artist, so to speak, unveiled,
Human and palpable as other men,
Yet more disquietingly beautiful;
To stand a moment in the mystic flame
That is my envelope, and there imbibe
The benison of air that I have breathed.
Nay, if I told you of the provinces
What I have suffered where my advent is
Like angels' visits, relatively rare,
And time admits no devious processes
But by his fringe must needs be rudely gripped—
It would surprise you. I have been pursued
By swift admirers, not to be denied,
Right into my hotel, and stood at bay,
A hunted thing, until the telephone
Summoned the brave police amd they arrived,
And drew a compass round my chaste retreat.
I mention this to salve your stricken pride
By solace drawn from numbers; you will see
That, as I said, your case is not unique.
For me, though not precisely celibate,
1 still must hold myself in high reserve.
I live for Art: myisoul is not my own
To give at pleasure; it is consecrated
To nobler uses. That, again, is why
I never boast about those private charms
Of person and deportment which provoke
Feminine flattery, butjseem to me
To win their only worth from being placed
At Art's disposal unreservedly,
With all emoluments attached thereto.
Sworn servitor of One, and One alone,
At Her tremendous feet I lay my gifts,
Content to be the minister who takes
Vicariously the homage meant for Her;
To be the happy medium by which
As through a filter, drained of vulgar dross,
The general worship percolates Her way.
An illustration. There was once a temple
Sacred to Phcebus. It contained a priest,
Himself a fair Apollo, lusty-limbed,
And, like the god's own laurels, evergreen;
A constant source of desperate concern
To fluttered ladies in the holy haunts.
Think you he took the lightest cognisance
Of carnal adoration? Not at all.
His eyes were on the altar, unaware;
Or, if he guessed what passions he inspired,
He feigned a child-like innocence, and said
"Apollo's be the praise!" and passed it on.
So I, who humbly tend the shrine of Art,
Not curious how my earthly charms may work
Havoc in heads susceptible as yours—
I give the glory where the thing is due,
And serve my ministry, and have my soul
Single in Her employ Whose priest I am.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Penelope (Mrs. KATE DOUGLAS WIGGINS), sighing for fresh
kingdoms to conquer, having flitted over England, and sped
through Scotland, has alighted on Ireland. Penelope's Irish
Experiences (GAY AND BIRD), is not the least delightful of the
trio of books. In some respects it is the best, since the
characteristics of the Irish people appeal more strongly to her
sympathies, her poetic temperament, and her keen sense of
humour. She does not shirk the gay shiftlessness of the people,
their indifference to cleanliness, tidiness, punctuality, and other
commonplaces, observance of which adds to the comfort of the
more stolid Saxon. But, as she writes, "The Irish peasants
would puzzle you, perplex you, disappoint you, with their incon-
sistencies; keep from liking them if you can." Penelope,
susceptible to the influence of her surroundings, scorns anything
like system. Wandering about the Island in occasionally
bewildering fashion, she comes on charming bits of nature and
meets delightful natives, male and female. Afore Hibernico, the
most original character in the book is the strange girl from
Salem, U.S.A., who comes accidentally on the scene and figures
in many of its brightest episodes. Through the pages runs a
pretty love-story, ending happily as it should. Penelope herself
is in love with her husband, Himself, as she terms him, filling
the provoking part which the Man of Wrath does with Elizabeth
in her German Garden. To crusty bachelors like my Baronite
it is quite boring to have charming women perpetually flinging
themselves at the feet of their absent husbands—a way of
putting it which shows how infectious is the more Hibernico
alluded to.
The Good Red Earth, EDEN PHILLPOTTS' latest contribution to
ARHOWSMITH'S three-and-sixpenny series of novels, is an excel-
lent piece of workmanship. My Baronite has seen many a worse
plot attenuated through a volume twice its bulk. The story is
set in the background of Devonshire. It is fragrant with the
perfume of nppleblossom ; later, as the months roll by, deepen-
ing into the rich, sweet smell of newly-made cider. The people
who till and own the good red earth are all alive, of true Devon
type, from the peasant at the plough to the landlord in his
ancient hall. Mr. Newte, the travelling pedlar—" Johnny Fort-
night" on week-days, a vessel of the Lord on Sundays—pouring
forth oil and balm into the spiritual woxuids of sinners gathered
in the Gospel Nest, is an exceedingly interesting person.
Round him with his unctuous ways is ravelled a tale that will be
found well worth reading. THE BAUON DE B.-W.

VISITORS IN OUR VILLAGE.
II.—LADY BATHWICK.
WE arc not very familiar with persons
of title in Puddleton, so that we were
impressed more than we cared to show
when a real live Countess came for a few
days' visit to the Rectory. On the morning
after her arrival I looked in at the Post-
Office—which is also the linen-draper's,
grocery, and bootshop—and found some ol
our leading inhabitants discussing the
ways of the aristocracy. Mr. DCGGAN,
the proprietor, was in his shirt sleeves,
sorting out his stock and re-arranging his
window, in the vague hope of attracting
a titled customer, while the blacksmith,
who holds extreme Radical views, plied
him with withering sarcasm.
"Tisagreat day for Puddleton!" he
said. "Look at Mr. DUGGAN now, a-
soortin' out his sand from the sugar! Oh,
a Lunnon lady must have her vittles
quite different from the likes of us. And
a Countess, too! Why, we must kneel
down when we see her comin', surelie!"
"Fust time as you've been on your
knees then this many a day," said the
parish clerk. "An" some of us do be
pleased to be respectful-like to them as
is set over us, same as passon said o'
Sunday."
"' Set over us '!" echoed the black-
smith with huge scorn. "An' who's set
this Lady BATHWICK over me? Tell her
to her face, I would, .so soon as look at
her."
"Hush, hush!" cried Mr. DUGGAN,
hastily plunging into his coat, "here's
her ladyship comin' down the road with
the Rector's wife!"
And as he spoke we saw them; the
stranger in s dress that filled us with
amazement, and set Mr. DUGGAN calcu-
lating its price per yard. Hhe wore
pince-nez, and looked about the village
street as she walked with an expression
much like that of a visitor at the Zoo.
Presently, she and her guide reached
the Post-Office—and, after a moment's
pause, they entered! Lady BATHWICK
carefully held up her skirt, and glanced
round her. Mr. DUGGAN bustled up with
his best professional manner, a note-book
in one hand, a newly-sharpened pencil in
the other. There was a moment of tense
silence. Then Lady BATHWICK spoke in
a deep bass voice. "You keep cheese?"
she demanded solemnly.
It was, the rest of us felt, not at all
the kind of thing you would expect a
Countess to ask for. Mr. DUUGAN, how-
ever, was equal to the occasion.
"Cheese, my lady? Certainly; ex-
cellent cheese, Gloucester, Dutch"
"You keep bacon and boots?" pur-
sued Lady BATHWICK.
"First quality bacon," replied Mr.
DUGGAN (looking, despite his efforts, a
it-tie surprised), "and boots also —

"OH, YOU CRUEL BOY, TO TABF. THOSE EQO8 OUP OF THE KF.9T! THINK OF TBK POOR
MOTH IK ISIKD WHEN 8HK COMKS" "THE MOTHER BIRD'S DEAD, MlSS."
"HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?" "I BIE IT IN YOUR HAT!"
though not exactly the style which—but,
perhaps your ladyship requires them for
a servant ?''
"You sell calico, and raisins, and
butter, and paraffin 'i " her ladyship went
on, pointing as she spoke to each of these
articles with her parasol.
"Certainly, my lady," said Mr. DfGGAX,
joyfully realising at length that these
aristocrats do their shopping on an
extensive scale, "butter, and raisins,
and—paraffin, I think your ladyship said?
If you will permit me to write down these
orders first ——''
•LOUISA," interrupted Lady BATHWICK,
burning to the Hector's wife, "just think
of it! All these things aro kept jumbled
up together in this poky little shop! I do
trust that you get down all your groceries
from the Stores. You can give me, please,
a shilling's-worth of penny stamps."
* * * * *
At the last election our Tory member
had a much-reduced majority. The local
ncwspaperattributed this to " the growing
reaction against Jingoism." As a matter
of fact, it was due solely to the energetic
support given by Mr. DUGGAN (hitherto a
member of the Primrose League) to the
Radical candidate, who included the
Abolition of the House of Lords in his
programme. A. C. D.

OCCASIONAL OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday, June 3. — More of Much Ado About Nothing.
Naturally, everything going better. Decidedly Herr Professor
STANFORD has made a hit. Reverse of a cricketer, the Pro-
fessor " scored" first and made a hit afterwards.
Tuesday.—"Not there, not there, my child."
Wednesday. — Die Meistersinger. Acting - Deputy Deponent
maketh oath and sayeth that this was about as good as any
warbling Wagnerite could wish. Frau GADSKI as Ei<a, and
M. VAN ROOY perfect as Hans Sachs. Being both perfect, the
praise must bo apportioned in the well-known formula, "Sachs
to one and half-a-doren to the other." Herr KNOTE kept up
the good old sporting tradition of a Derby Night at the Opera
by becoming a little hoarse (petit cheval) in the third act.
Perhaps not up to so much weight. However, as he was not
placed bourse de combat he contrived to be well up at the
finish. Mr. BISPHAM brought out all the Wagnerian waggishness
of Beckmesser. Altogether, a brighter and quicker perform-
ance than heretofore, due probably to Herr LOUSE having
judiciously withdrawn a considerable number of Wagnerian
notes from circulation.
Thursday, June 0.—Preeixi's La Boheme in Italian, which
doesn't seem to suit it so well as the light and musical-airy
French. Charming opera! So delightful to see the four
poverty-stricken Brothers of the Brush living all together in
an attic capable of accommodating a party of two or three
hundred persons! So snug. No wonder Benoit (well played
by M. DtJFiiit'HE, who, absolutely transformed, is "afterwards
Alcindoro," a gay but stingy old fop) cannot get his rent for
such a spacious apartment from this merry quartette, who
seem to have been the Balzacian prototypes of the lively
French students, who took such an interest in poor Trilby.
As Rodolfo, Signor ANSELMI sings and acts at his very best,
in spite of the absurdity of the early nineteenth-century
Quartier-Latin costume, in which they all look so supremely
ridiculous, and yet, when all are struck mute in the
presence of the dying heroine, so grotesquely affecting. Telle
cut la vie de Buhimel Excellent comedian, Sl'OTTl, as Mitt-cello
droll Mons. GlLIBKRT, looking a perfect monx among the mole-
hills, as Nchaunard, and M. ISUARDOX, trhs blengrime as Co/fine
all playing and singing in such style as leaves nothing to be
desired, except that there were more of it with shorter waits
between the acts, which are evidently being spun out to keei
up the very latent traditions of the opera ; for which reason als<
Madame MKLBA has to go mad as Lucia after she has come to a
sad, untimely, but tuneful end as Miiiit. Another illusioi
destroyed! Better to commence at half-past eight, and to le
us depart at eleven with sad echo of poorMimi's sweetest note
lingering in our ears. MELBA'S is a clever performance of Mini
the grisetto, a typo now-a-days perhaps rarely met with, even
in the Quartier Latin, and the coyness, gentleness, and innate
modesty—for this is possible—of the uneducated girl, fo
whose station in life there is no precise English equivalent, ar
emphasised by Mme. MELBA with such tact as to bring thes
qualities into strong contrast with the dashing gaiety of th
high-spirited, quick-tempered, inconstant constant Musetta
represented to the life, and sung to perfection by Fraiilei
FRITZI SCHKFP. Her realistic picture of Musetta is a Franco
German work of great worth, in fact, a Scheff d'ccuvre.
For the first time in their musical and dramatic characte
Ir. STEDMAN'S choir of boys, when at the Fair, where all was
aiety and merriment, took their pleasures most sadly and
olemnly. There was no life nor spirit in them. What was the
matter? Had they been told that they were to suggest to the
udience that it was the last hour of the holidays? Cheer up,
my lads; or, as HENRY RUSSELL would have sung, "Cheer,
joys, cheer, no more of idle sorrow!"
And with whom lies the responsibility for the operatic snow?
n the third act, " Oh, what a fall was there!" Perhaps, were
•ne to inquire "Oi't sont leu nciges d'antanf" the answer
vould be that the supply had not given out, and that in order
o show there was plenty more %vhere that came from, the
Snow-man over the Borders let small flakes dribble away and
all through the roof—sadly needing repair—of the Artists' attic,
where, in fourth act, poor Mimi passes gently away. Well,
f it were true that one can't have too much of a good thing,
hen this surplusage of snow would never be de trap in any
jpera, say in the garden scene of Borneo and Juliet, or during
ton Giovanni's banquet. Advice to the Snow Producer—
'Drop it"; but not in the manner it was dropped on this
'lovely night in June."
The calls before the curtain were hearty and numerous; not
one singer among them whom the audience did not delight to
lonour, especially Queen MELBA, "more power to her elba!"
But to "drop into verse" is not permitted, so An rcvoir to
Bddles and 'celli, Congratulations to MANCINKLLI. I hope the
omens seem to indicate Great success to the Opera Syndicate.
WALK UP! CLIMB UP!!
CLIMB up to the top to see and hear Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER,
who is, as usual, "sans peur et sans reproche "—unless we
reproach him with not having very many novelties to give us.
has introduced The Magic, Doll into his programme, which is
much the same sort of tricky show as was given in last year's
Drury Lane pantomime. It is clever and amusing: but we prefer
more of CHEVALIER. "Our Bazaar," "The Old Actor," and
other favourites going strong, especially whore the CHEVALIER
appears as the Coster and sings "Mafekin' Night"; Mr. HARRY
CARSDALE'S imitations of farm-iliar sounds in a farm-yard are
nimitable, and, as a specimen of "turn and turnabout," when
the Lion Comique makes an ass of himself, the audience roar!
It is altogether a capital entertainment, including "Phantas-
magoria " excellently performed on an Erard Grand by the clever
piano-forte executant Mr. A. H. WEST. But to what a height
Mr. CHEVALIER'S patrons have to go in order to reach the hall
where he performs! If his friends in and out of the Press "give
him a lift" now and then, why does not he return the com-
pliment and give the public "a lift" to take 'em up and down
in the twopenny-tube elevator style? As it is, the entertain-
ment invariably commences with the old air, and very little
wind to play it, "Such a-gettin' up stairs."
THANKS TO THE L. H. C.
THE Lord High Chancellor, at the banquet of the Newspaper
Press Fund, took occasion to refer in terms of grave disappro-
bation to "The Fringe of the Press." His Lordship doclaretl
it was a pity that this fringe should always be trailing ii
the mud. Fringe is generally used for ornament; but, ap-
parently, the fringe to which Lord HALSBURY referred is the
reverse" of ornamental and equally the reverse of anything
useful. Surely, the remedy is to cut off the fringe. A lady
adopts that action when an otherwise smart gown is so
disfigured. The fabric of the Press should be treated on the
lines accepted by the lady with the smart dress. Let the
muddy fringe be cut off, or, if that cannot be done, let the
fringe be prevented in the future from trailing in the gutter
Surely that is a duty fitting the responsibilities of gentlemen
of the Press.

TEETH!
(To Mr. Punch.)
FORGIVE mo, sir, if, under strong compulsion,
I lay my load of grief before your throne.
You are the source of ease to them that toil;
Your words give comfort, and your smiles can smooth
The brows of those who dwell with black despair.
Wherefore, you ask, this pitiful appeal,
These sighs, these lamentations, and this woe?
Wherefore these downcast looks that rob the day
Of brightness and make night more desolate;
This gloomy gait, as of a mute who treads
The dismal ways that lead to Kensal Green?
I'll toll you, sir, for you are one who knows
The sadness and the mystery of life;
You can explain in words what others feel,
Others who stumble when they strive to speak,
And, speaking, make confusion more confused.
Well, sir, I have a babe like other babes,
A babe its mother deems a paragon,
The glass of beauty and the mould of wit.
To me, though much 1 love to watch its sports,
Its aimless, staggering rushes, and its falls,
Flat as the flattest pancake on the floor;
To hear its shouts, its puvple-visaged screams
Of shameless anger, passionate attempts
To be the tyrant of its nursery realm;
To note its inarticulate endeavours
At dissyllabic oft-repeated words,
"Papa," " Mama," or "Nana," or " Tata "—
To me who own I am a Ruffian man
It is a babe, a plain thing, but mine own.
This infant, Sir, has TEETH (or is to have),
Teeth growing, as I judge, from head to foot,
Teeth scattered over all its dumpling frame,
Teeth heedless whence they come or where they sprout,
Teeth that can be the secret cause of all
The ills that ADAM brought on mortal men.
The- babe falls down and howls, its nurse says " Teeth ";
Its forehead shows a bruise, its hand a scar—
"Teeth," says its nurse, its mother echoes "Teeth."
Teeth are the reason for its silent moods,
Teeth make it babble, teeth produce the whim
That makes it pinch its sister, or refuse
To "say good-bye to Gran'ma " or to hail
With smiles of joy each self-created aunt.
Teeth cause it to denude its doll of hair,
To stamp upon the kitten and to be
Sleepless of nights or sleepy in the day.
Teeth, teeth and teeth! the world is one huge; tooth
That's always on the point of coming through,
Invisible, but sharp, and never comes. U. C. L.
THE MOORISH MISSION.—"Cms BRITANNICUS " wishes to be

EXTRACTS FROM THE TRAVEL DIAKT OF
TOBY. M.P.
R.M.S. Egypt, Bay of Biscay, Saturday.
—" TOBY, dear boy," said PRI>X-E ARTHCR
on the eve of adjournment for Whitsun
Recess, "wish you 'd do something for us.
Here 's Whitsun holiday; made it as long
as I could. Use it by running over to
Gibraltar, and look into this affair of
the defences. Yes, I know; but, between
us, CAP'EN TOMMY BOWLES wasn't quifce
the man to deal with the affair. He's a
genius; what we want is the opinion of
a sound, practical, I won't say stolid,
person, free from flights of imagination.
You '11 really do the State a service if
you'll undertake the job."
Accordingly, here I am, steaming over
placid pond defamed by usual associations
connected with Bay of Biscay. Quite a
number of acquaintances on board. As
many Members of House of Commons as
I 've sometimes sat with in Committee
of Supply voting millions. Item, two of
the busiest men at the Bar. Seems to
have occurred to a score of busy men that
here is the model holiday when time is
limited. Leave London on Thursday;
arrive at Gibraltar on Monday; returning,
leave for Plymouth on Tuesday; eight
days at sea; or go on to Marseilles and
back overland, staying a night in Paris.
Better still, if you can spare the time,
sec Ronda, Malaga, Granada, and Seville.
This an alluring prospect for men of
leisure and freedom from public cares.
As for me, all my time will be taken up
grubbing round Gibraltar, getting to the
bottom of this difficulty about the de-
fences.
Hotel Rcina Christina, Algeciras, Mon-
day.—" Algeciras is an ancient Moorish
town," writes GEOKOE BORROW, visiting it
sixty years ago. Town unaltered since
his eye looked upon it. The same white
houses, with flower-garlanded, iron-barred
balconies, through which Juliet may look
at Romeo and talk to him, which, indeed,
she does every evening. Here is the
river and its beautiful bridge; in front,
the bay of Gibraltar wearing on its bosom
the jewel of the Rock. At a stride
(taken in a comfortable steamer) the
visitor passes from British dominion and
modern civilisation to old Spain that has
learned nothing through the centuries,
and doesn't feel the need of learning.
Algeciras is in Spain, but the bold
Briton has fastened his grip upon the
place; has made a railway through
apparently impossible passages in the
mountains going northward to Grenada.
Of late has built a hotel, the prettiest,
most perfectly designed the travelled
MEMBER FOR SARK has come across in his
wanderings. In style, a happy combination
of Moorish palace and English mansion.
Long been a reproach cast at Gibraltar
that its hotel accommodation does not tempt
the wayfarer to sojourn long. Here, twenty
minutes' journey by steamer, is a gem of
a residence, set in a climate amid scenery
that rivals the choicest bits of the Riviera.
Immediately opposite is the Rock, its
aspect changing every moment under the
varying shadows of the clouds; in the
morning and evening bathed in the glory
of the rising and the setting sun. Behind
is a circle of the everlasting hills, the
blue Mediterranean lapping the shore at
its feet.
Ronda, Tuesday.—" Call me at half-past
five," I said to the polyglot factotum on
going to bed last night at the Hotel Heine
Christina. "Si, Signer, very weel," he
replied. And he called me at five.
Train starts northward at 0.35. At the
station the inevitable couple of Carabin-
eers, who carry their ancient fowling-piece
as if it were a babe in arms, insist upon
opening every article of our baggage;
understood to be in search of dutiable
goods ; exercise seems superfluous. Here
we are in a Spanish town, bent on railway
journey through a Spanish country, the
area being subjected to equal customs
duties. How, in these circumstances, we
could evade or outrage them does not
appear. Put the case before the Cara-
bineer. He listens with flattering atten-
tion. When I conclude, fancying I have
made favourable impression, he calls up
the other Carabineer, who dangles his
musket in the hollow of his arms, with
the muzzle directed upon me. This
arranged, his comrade goes through my
portmanteau and other things.
Three hours and a-half run to Ronda;
on the up-grade all the way; magnificent
country, by mountain and river, through
vineyards and olive groves. Nearing
Ronda look ba«k and see the Sierra
Nevada flashing white teeth abovo the
ranges of lower hills. Englishmen found
the money for the marvellous engineer-
ing feat of making a railway through
these pathless mountain tracks. English
engineers built the line, and a Scotch-
man manages it. An unknown'.country
for the great army of the British tourist.
In freshness and beauty that sometimes
rise to the height of grandeur, he would
find it worth looking up. For miles be-
side the railway track runs the Gnadiana.
Sometimes a deep stream of blue water;
sometimes spreading out over a stony
bed ; further on gathering up its strength
to dash in foam over the rocks.
Ronda, 8,000 feet above the sea level, is
not too hot even on this midsummer day.
The Romans, who knew a fine site when
they saw it, settled here. Over their
amphitheatre the Spaniards built a bull-
ring, now the oldest in the Kingdom. In
a later century the Moors and the
Spaniards, conqueror and conquered,
dwelt together separated by a riven
mountain. The cleft is 200 feet wide,
350 deep. At the bottom the river runs,
working flour mills and thedynamos which
flood the meanest quarter with electric
light. At one side of the Taja the Moors
dwelt, their houses standing to this day.
On the other the Spaniards waited their
opportunity.
"Odd," says SARK, "how closely the
Moor is connected with the history of
Spain. Odder still that we had not the
least great." "What was his name?"
"Sir JOHN MOORE. Corunna, you remem-
ber."
Granada, Wednesday.—Wakened at sun-
rise by the nightingales singing in the
garden of the Alhambra, as they sang
when BOABDIL ruled in its spacious courts.
A short night owing to cheerful habits of
landlord's family. Consists of two Demon-
boys, their customs peculiar. A haggard-
looking fellow-guest, who left by the
earliest train this morning, tells me the
night before last he was awakened at
half-past eleven by trundling of cart down
hill of narrow thoroughfare that faces
sleeping rooms of hotel. It was in charge
of the Demon-boys. Game was to drag
cart to top of hill; one Demon got in;
the other ran by its side; both shouting
at top of voice of supernatural shrillness.
A gleam momentarily lightened the
leaden life of the sleepless guest as ho
mentions a strange coincidence. The
contents of a jug of water fell on the
pathway just as the Demons halted under
his window with intent to make another
journey up the hill. After that there was
silence.
To-night the Demons, having dried their
clothes, broke out in fresh place. As
omnibus starts to catch train at 6.80 a.m.,
guests go to bed early. Turned in at 10.0 last
night tired with slowest railway journey,
from Bobadilla to Granada, ever suffered
by man. Fell asleep at once. Suddenly
awakened by uproar outside; listened for
the great bell in the Tower of the Alhambra
that signals revolution. Granada, answer-
ing the signal from Seville, responding to
mad cry of the men of Madrid, evidently
on foot to turn out the King and slay
somebody. Heard above the din, a shrill
voice answered by another; dull sound of
kicking and thumping;; massacre evidently
commenced; got out of bed; peered
cautiously through windows opened wide
to the summer night; beheld a strange
sight.
The Demon-boys had organised a mid-
night football match; team composed of
the domestic establishment. There was
the cook, with white apron gleaming in
the moonlight over portly paunch, kick-
ing like anything. The head waiter,
wildly waving a serviette, brushed imagi-
nary flies off the football. Boots, with
somebody's shoe on his left hand, yelled
at the top of his voice. The stable-men,
the 'bus-driver, our chamber-maid, an
elderly female of morose countenance,

who sullenly made our Ijeds five minutes
before \ve got into them—they were all
there. All shouting, all kicking, whether
the football was in sight or not. As for
the Demon-boys, they answered to each
other as deep calls unto deep. Also they
had a quite undue share of the football,
which they kicked to each other over
the heads of the crowd.
Happily that didn't matter, the cook
just as pleased kicking at nothing as if
his foot felt the exhilarating impact of
the ball. Boots bellowed every time the
ball was kicked. As for chambermaid,
she thumped away at space as if smitten
with remorse at the recollection that
earlier in the evening she had forgotten
to shake up beds made up of some myste-
rious compound of flock and remnants of
old carpets.
It was an ineresting sight, not lacking
in excitement, bufc it was also a quarter
of an hour past midnight, and majority
of the guests were to be called at 5.30.
Through the still night rose the voice of
the cook, chanting:
UQ manco escribo una carta—(kick);
l"n siego la esta mirando—(thump);
Un mudo la esta Icyendo—(thump):
Y un sordo la esta escuchando—(kick).
It.M.H. Peninsula, Tuesday.—Homeward
bound; Gibraltar fading in distance;
beautiful Algeciras out of sight. Suddenly
horrible thought possesses me. Forgot
all about my mission! Meant to go
thoroughly into question of Gibraltar
defences. Entirely slipped my memory.
All due to the horrors *of my night at
Granada. Spent the following day amid
the marvels of the Alhambra ; drove about
the Town ; visited the Cathedral; stood in
the vault, lighted by tallow dips, in which
sleep FERDINAND and ISABELLA.
Pretty tired after a hot day, but could
not face prospect of another night in
company of the Demon-boys of Granada.
Sure to have fresh entertainment on hand
for the night. Rather journey southward
through the silent stretches of corn and
the green pastures, the olive groves, the
vineyards, the orchards where grow the
lemon, orange, pomegranate, fig and peach.
They stretch inimitably under the moon-
light, and the peace of midnight is infinite
when I think of what is going on in the
steep, narrow street before the hotel in
the precincts of the Alhambra.
Shall comeback again; understand why
the Spaniards always talk of Maiiana.
To-day is so beautiful in this sunlit land
that we leave all burdens for To-morrow.
By the way, the MEMBER FOR SAHK has
got for me translation of the song the
cook sang at the midnight football match.
It runs like this:
A hand less mnn a letter did write:
A dumb dictated it word for word;
The person who read it had lost his eight:
And deaf was he who listened and heard.

THIS IS HOW IT CAME ABOUT, THAT GOSSIPS 8PRF.AD "THE- BEPORT THAT "YOUNG EDGAR

What useful cause can we advance
By teaching them the tongue of France,

I wonder.

Could agitate the mind of him

In Derbyshire! Would any clown
Suppose that folk would ever drown
In Chesterfield, an inland town?
I wonder.
Why train the body? Wherefore store
The infant mind with useless lore?
And what is education for?

And why, oh, why have I been sent
To make these speeches? What was
meant
By making me Lord President?
I wonder.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVAEI.
IN GOOD COMPANY.
FOR his very light comedy at the Court Theatre, Mr.
BRANDON THOMAS has not hit upon an attractive title in calling
it Women are so Serious. Such a title may, perhaps, arouse
curiosity, but the " perhaps " is a very big one. Not that M.
PIERRE WOLFF was happily inspired in naming the original
French piece (whence this is light-heartedly adapted) "Celles
<j»'oii Respecte." But, thank goodness, there is scarcely a
serious moment in this piece, which is acted for all it is worth,
professing to be only a comedy of character. Were not the
light and airy play kept going by the perfect acting of every-
one concerned it would fall to the ground in the very first act;
but, played as it is, with natural dialogue naturally given, it
rattles on with such a pace that the audience, if never
intensely interested, is from first to last kept thoroughly
amused.
Miss ELLIS JEFFERIES as the vivacious Mrs. Gunthorpe,
i«rinni et mutabile, never lets action or dialogue flag. She pre-
eminently is "ono of the lifes and souls" of the piece, and
artistically contrasted with her is her husband, the stolid,
chuckling Algij Gunthorpe of Mr. GEORGE GIDIJENS, the bicy-
clist-maniac who gives up to the wheel the time he ought to
pass with his wife, and whose habit of " pedalling," even when
he his quietly seated in the drawing-room, ^yould "get on the
nerves" of anyone even less highly-strung than is the flighty
Mrs. Ounthorpe. Of course, all this is exaggeration, but it is
very funny, and, except the highly improbable "pedalling,"
the action is rarely overdone; wherein lies the cleverness of
the performance.
As Lady Wavelet/, a quiet, worldly-wise, sly-pusslike
character, rather difficult to place, Miss MABEL TERRY-LEWIS
plays with considerable skill, but to the last leaves the
audience, which pays its money and takes its choice, to decide
whether she is rather partial to the male-flirt, Harold Twyford,
and jealous of her married friend, Mrs. Gunthorpe, or whether
she is only a coquette interfering in what doesn't concern her
out of mere vanity and love of intrigue. It is not a colourless
part, but it is a blend.
As Cora, the sharp, businesslike Red Cross nurse (not that
she is either "Red" or "Cross," but this only applies to the
costume with the badge), who, having been once temporarily
taken in by the gallant and grateful Harold (whom she has
nursed in hospital), finds out what his professions of love are
worth, returns his presents, and throws him over, after having
secured as her husband Harold'n superior officer, Miss CON-
STANCE COLLIER is excellent.
Mr. HERBERT STANDING, as Major Datibeny, whose part, indeed,
mainly consists of "Standing on," gets a laugh for every
utterance ; he rarely has to say more than two or three words
at a time, but every word tells. He speaks forcibly, abruptly,
clearly, and to the point; which point he immediately makes,
startling the audience into a short, sharp laugh that is the
very echo of the character. He is so in earnest: it is delightful.
A very clever bit of character acting.
The part of Hipton, the portly butler, is well rendered by
Mr. W. H. QfiXTON, as also is the small part of Sopley, the
soldier-servant, by Mr. It. C. HERZ. •
The fatuous, selfish, irresponsible, male-flirt, Harold Twyford,
is made-up and played to perfection by Mr. FREDERICK KERR.
Harold Twyford makes love to anyone at a moment's notice, for,
like the "dogs" that "delight to bark and bite," and the
"bears and lions" that "growl and light," in the ancient
nursery verse of Dr. WATTS, "it is his nature to." Matri-
mony he never contemplates; he is heartless, but the author
lets him off scot free. It is true that, in an aside, he says he
will have to leave the regiment because the Major has
married Cora, who will now be "his commanding officer "; but
does anyone believe for a moment that this prospect is in the
least likely to trouble him after the first few hours? Truly,
'tis a play without a moral of any sort: it simply forewarns
male-flirts, that if they cannot refrain from making love to
every pretty woman they meet, it is as well not to observe
precisely the same form of address to each lady who may
encourage their attentions. Harold is still flirting as the
curtain descends, nor does one feel that the sudden recon-
ciliation .of Algy Gunthorpe and his wife is likely to be lasting.
Though, on the whole, the play does little more than suggest
material for dramatic development, yet, so far as it goes,
every act is highly amusing, and of the three the second is
the best, going admirably without a single pause for reflection,
and eliciting from the audience a genuinely hearty call at the
fall of the curtain. Prosit!
By the way, the comedy, which doesn't commence till nine,
is preceded at 8.15 by a performance of The Musketeer Concert
Party, which we advise those inclined to patronise " masked
minstrels" and part - singing with comic interludes on no
account to miss. Their only mistake is in having a piano on
the stage; it is quite out of the picture and damages the effect.
There is a piano in the orchestra, why not use that? Musketeers
would have done better with mandolines or guitars; but, as
they sing quite up-to-date songs, why not insert " Modern"
before " Musketeers " in the descriptive title?
FEMININE FASHION; OR, GIRLS ARE XOW IN SEASON.
[" It is cheering to learn from a society correspondent that'girls are to be
fashionable this year.' Last year was distinctly a matrons' season."
St. James's ffturtte.]
OH, MABEL, dear MABEL, for years I have waited
My passionate love to declare.
At times I believed that to part we were fated
By fashion—forgive my despair!
Oh, the dread apprehension that you might succumb,
Out of spite, to some fashionless peer,
While I by this social decree was held dumb—
Girls are not the fashion this year!
If you knew half the torture I had to go through
In attempting my passion to smother,
When, instead of my paying attention to you,
I had to make love to your mother.
But you in my heart, dear, none else could supplant.
I poured out the wealth of my passion
In a violent outburst of love to your aunt—
Because girls were not then in fashion.
Can't you guess how I sighed for a glance from your eyes
As I punted your aunt up the stream?
And enlarged on the beauty of water and skies;
She is deaf—which obliged me to scream.
I 'm afraid the excursion was painfully slow,
It presently came on to rain.
How 1 longed for the time when the matron would go,
And girls come in fashion again!
And T felt that perhaps you might not understand
How disinterested were my intentions,
WThen T, roguishly pressing your grandmamma's hand,
Complimented her on her dimensions.
I hope you '11 allow 'twas an excellent cause
When you 're fully aware of the reason;
I flirted with grandmamma, MABEL, because
Last year chaperons were in season.
But now, dearest MABEL, by Fashion's decree
The matron 's a thing of the past.
I need not run after your mother, so we
Can love one another at last.
For girls are the fashion this year, so I 'm able
To open ray floodgates of passion.
How delightful to make violent love to you, MABEL,
And know I am strictly in fashion!

But it is one part of our duty to keep

put them down. Splendid division of

Cif. Off. (taking up his pen). Yes; and
as I have a lot to do, unless
Mil. Off. Wouldn't disturb you for
worlds, my dear fellow; but I 'm afraid I
must just ask you officially to be so kind
as to lend a helping hand.
Civ. Off. (coining to attention). Oh, cer-

Mil. Off. Well, you'see things are not
working quite smoothly. Most of our
chiefs, frankly, are not up to much.
Cit>. Off. It is not the business of a
civilian to make remarks, but it was
thought possible when the Report was

I fancy that most of us are a bit ofl
colour.
C'ir. Off. (u'il/i intention.) You said you
wanted to speak to me officially.
Mil. Off. To IHJ sure. Well, to tell the
truth we have made rather a mess of a
whole heap of commissariat contracts, and
I don't think we have done quite the right
thing about arranging the transports, and
there's a good deal of complaint about the
barrack buildings, and——•
Cio. Off. (who lias been tubing hurried

Mil. Off. (airily). Shall in good time, my
dear fellow; all in good time. But now

we soldier fellows find it a bit hard to
keep ahead of our work.
Civ. Off. (with a glance at his arrears).
But when I have full particulars, what do
you want me to do?
Mil. Off. Why, to perform the function
allotted to you by the Report—to explain
matters to Parliament.
Cir. Off. (grimly). 1 will undertake that
duty with the greatest pleasure.

TO TRIPTOLEMUS.
[" Triptolemus was inspired by the goddess
Demeter with the idea of extending the growth of
corn all over Greece. In order to enable him to
travel rapidly from place to place, the provided
him with a single wheel, across which he used to
stride. Hence Hjginus declares him to have been
the one quiprimus fiominum una rota dieitur titiu
ne curnu moraretur."—Westminster Gazette.]
HAIL! foremost pioneer
Of the myriad cyclist race!
At length, at length appear
In thy duly honoured place
As our blessed patron saint, as thou
shouldst be,
Who taught us first to feel
The joy of whirling wheel,
"Mid the glint of flashing steel—
Hail to thee!
Blest was the day that saw thy birth
And blest the land that gave thec us,
O son of Ocean and of Earth,
Triptolemus!
By theo the golden wheat was sown,
By thee was garnered first the corn;
No harvests made the waggons groan
Ere thou wast born.
The famished nations cried to thco
To stave their hunger: "Give, oh,
give
Thy blessings unto us that we
May learn to live!"
Thus cried the people hour by hour,
And thou didst hear their dying call,
Yet hadst not thou the magic power
To visit all.
Then from Olympus bright
A radiant vision fled
Swift through the stilly night,
And stood beside thy bed;
A goddess fair with a garland rare
Of yellow corn in her golden hair,
And whispered in mine car—•
Divinest Demeter.
Up with a nimble leap
Or ever it was day
Thou sprangest from thy sleep,
Her bidding to obey;
And anvil rang and the sp:irk upsprang
As the hammer fell with its ceaseless clang,
And ere the set of sun
The Goddess' will was done!
Behold thec flying swift
As zephyr through the air,
And lavishing thy gift
Of plenty everywhere!
Thou wast the first that ever ljurst
A tyro upon a flint accurst;
Then hear the hymns that rise from us,
O patron-saint, Triptolemus!

CHAM; that China should be brought more into

H.I.M. THE EMPEROR sailed his own
junk at the festival of Yot-Ting. Honours
seemed likely to rest with the Mandarin
LiP-TuN's junk, but a hint, conveyed to
him through the speaking-trumpet, that
unless he gave way and allowed the
Imperial vessel to win, he, the Mandarin,
might get himself disliked, materially
contributed to the Son of Heaven's easy
victory.
At the conclusion of the junk races,
the EMPEROR came ashore and indulged
in turns on the Steam Roundabout until
he fell ofl. The proprietor, overcome by
His Majesty's condescension, asked him
for payment—two taels—and immediately
lost his own head in consequence.
The Derby was, of course, won by
H.I. Majesty's twenty-year-old but peer-
less steed Wot-ah-Krock which took the
stakes, though some misguided spectators
affirmed—but in very low tones, however
—that the noble beast finished tenth.
There was a good race for second prize,
though it was afterwards found that this
would not be given, as, in order to save
all squabbling in the matter, the Clerk of
the Course, Ho-Krs, had already annexed
the prize-money himself.
The likin on the rivers has been raised
five per cent., and though the waterside

<i rule, when the first sounds are emitted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TALE OF A CAT.
IT is quite certain that LAVINIA would
never have offered to take charge of
Tibbij, the black cat, if she had not had
"expectations" from her Aunt JANE,
whose property the animal was. And
even had LAVINIA been willing, her
husband, Mr. STUBBS, would decidedly
have objected.
He hated all animals, cats more particu-
larly, but LAVINIA'S aunt, was comfortably
off, and it was as well to keep in with
her, in view of contingencies.
So when she went over to Paris for a
few days—she did this once every year—
LAVINIA had offered to provide a kind
home for Tibby during her
absence; for the old lady did
not like to leave her pet to the
tender mercies of a rather
flighty domestic servant.
But 1'il-i'u did not take at all
kindly to his new quarters.
Perhaps the brand of catsmeat
was not one that he cared
about; perhaps he did not
relish being first trodden on
and then kicked by Mr. STUBBS.
Anyway, on the morning fol-
lowing his arrival, he was
nowhere to be found.
Here was a pretty state of
affairs! LAVINIA was frantic;
Mr. STUBBS greatly upset, and
full of strange oaths. Both re-
cognised that it was a serious
matter for them, and might en-
tiil the estrangement of Aunt
JANE and the final disappoint-
ment of their hopes.
What was to be done?
Enquiries were made at all
the neighbouring houses—after
their own had been searched
from cellar to garret — and
notices of the loss, with offers
of pecuniary reward for the re-
covery of the animal, were
posted on the front gate. All
in vain. Not a sign was there
of the missing Tibby.
They thought it best not to write and
tell Aunt JANE of the misfortune that had
befallen. It could only upset her, declared
Mr. STUBBS, sympathetically; besides,
the animal might turn up before she
returned—or—
Mr. STUBBS had an idea!
"Why not?" he said to his wife. "All
cats avc much alike—it 'a only a matter of
colour. Tibby was all black"
"\^ ith a -vhite spot on the chest," put
in LAVINIA.
"Quite so—but there are heaps of cats
answering to that description. I 'II go to
the Dials to-day, and see if I can't get
one like it. The old womttft '11 never know
the difference."
LAVINIA, though not so confiden^ of the
success of the trick as her husband, could
yet see no other course open. She simply
dared not, she declared, inform her aunt
of the true state of affairs. It w'ould be
best, no doubt, to obtain a cat as like
Tibby as possible and keep it in reserve,
to produce should the real animal not
turn up by the time of the old lady's
return.
This was fixed for two days later.
Before that time Mr. STUBBS had con-
trived to obtain a pussy that, in appear-
ance at least, was the very double of the
missing Tibby. Unfortunately it was of a
different sex and not so amiable, but these
were details which, it was hoped, Aunt
JANE would not notice.
'Ill

THE SHORTEST STUMP SPEECH ON RECORD.
"We '11 say it has got peevish through
separation from her," said Mr. STUBBS,
jocularly. He, at any rate, felt convinced
that the old lady would be deceived.
Needless to say the greatest care was
taken of the new cat, which was ensconced
in a comfortable basket on a soft mat,
with a piece of cerise ribbon round its
furry neck.
Aunt JANE'S plan was to return to hor
home on leaving Paris, and call on her
niece for the cat on the following day.
Some little disappointment, therefore,
or perhaps some little astonishment merely,
was felt when that day passed without a
sign of her or a word from her.
"I wonder what she's playing at!"
said Mr. STUBBS to his spouse. "You'd
better write to her, and don't forget to
say the cat is nice and comfortable."
LAVINIA did so. And as regards the,
cat, she spoke in glowing terms, both of
its own charms, and of the tender care it
had met with at the hands of her husband
and herself. She concluded by expressing
a hope that her dear aunt would couieand
fetch it soon—not that she wanted to be
rid of it, of course, or let her Bave
trouble by bringing it to the old lady's
residence.
In reply, Aunt JANE wrote a letter
which caused LAVINIA to shed tears for a
week, and Mr. STUBBS to use the most
dreadful language, besides kicking the
new cat out of its comfortable basket
into the street, to its great
astonishment and indignation.
Aunt JANE had been sur-
prised, she said, after her
niece's promises to take care
of her pet, to find poor Tibby
at her house, when she arrived
home, with not a drop of milk
in his basin—for which she had
given her maid notice — and
otherwise vilely tended. But
she had been even more sur-
prised at her niece's attempt
to deceive her by palming off
another cat as her one and
only Tibby. That was quite
unpardonable, and Aunt JANE
could only surmise where LAVI-
NIA would go to ultimately for
being guilty of such appalling
cmendaity.
The "expectations," as
Mr. and Mrs. STUBBS dejectedly
realised, were "off."
That wretched Tibby, follow-
ing an instinct which Mr.
STUBBS now recollected—too
late—is common in cats, had
quietly returned home without
the formality of bidding good-
bye to its host and hostess,
and, after travelling the thirty
miles or so between the two
residences, had arrived looking
very muddy and disreputable.
And it is now generally thought that
Aunt JANE'S money will go, either to her
other niece, LAVINIA'S cousin, or to the
Cats' Home, or to both in equal shares.

M. Regis writes to M. Drumont:—
WE fought, man cher, at half-past eight,
The day was fine but not too warm,
The ground was thronged, at every gate
Policemen stood in uniform.
They ushered ticket-holders in
But kept the vulgar herd outside.
And while we waited to begin,
I looked at them with conscious pride.
Some fifty of them, so 'tis said,
Leaving their customary beats,
Were busily employed instead
In putting people in their seats;
They opened gates for carriages, t
They checked the tickets of admission,
And showed in many different ways
A most obliging disposition.
Fair ladies sat on every side,
Each in her most becoming dress;
Care had been taken to provide
Accommodation for the Press;
Reporters stuck to us like burrs,
They never let us out of sight,
While dozens of photographers
Were taking snapshots of the fight.
My face, impassive yet alert,
Maintained its customary hue,
I wore a light pyjama shirt,
My gloves were red, my trousers blue,
And though it's true that victory
Remained with Monsieur LABERDESQUE
The ladies one and all agree
My clothes were far more picturesque!
After the duel ceased perforce
My flery heart, which nothing tames,
Drove me to the usual course
Of calling my opponent names';
He manifested no surprise
(Although my seconds stood aghast),
But seemed amused to recognise
That I was canaille to the last!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
REVERIE OF A "SPECIAL."
UPON the lonely veld he lay
Beneath the morning sun;
It was a treat to have the heat
Undo what night had done;
To watch hia frozen limbs relax
Sensibly, one by one.
No horrid sound of war's alarms
Imperilled his repose;
Just here and there through halcyon air
A little fume uprose,
And a pleasant smell of burning farm
Tickled his nimble nose.
An intellectual content
Across his features shone
His active brain ignored the pain
Of occupation gone;
And thought about the monthly pay
That went serenely on.
"Of such a life," said he, "I fain
Would have a longish lease;
But I foresee that we shall be
Some day reduced to peace;
Even the nicest kind of'war
Must ultimately cease.
"There was a time when I aspired
To rank among the men
Who make you feel the flash of steel
By force of the mightier pen,
For those were days when things oc-
curred,
And battles happened then.
"But soon the Censor's dreadful shears
Curtailed my teeming lines,
And coarsely hacked the phrases that
smacked
Of the juice of purple vines;
Till nobody recognised my art
By any inward signs.
"My figurative speech was made
To doff its broidered dress;
My wit was shorn and left forlorn
Of all its brave flnesse;
My wires have even been confused
With those of the Tory Press.
"But still in letters I could find
An ample scope and space;
My pregnant plume could here resume
Its ancient verve and grace;
But now—events have given up
The habit of taking place.
"And if I turn to pure romance,"
That welling fount is dried;
Suppose I paint some brilliant feint
Conceived in my own inside,
The Chief is sure to send a wire
Saying that I have lied.
"I cannot raise a fresh effect
Out of the local Dutch;
I dare not ' do' the trite caroo
With the old artistic touch;
It has been done for all it 'a worth,
And that was never much.
"And yet a more disturbing thought
Has left my soul resigned;
I know my trade has long mislaid
Its grip of the public mind;
I know that what was once a Power
Is nothing of the kind.
"They say that Mr. BALFOUR gets
Elsewhere his open views;
To the Chief, again, we had to explain
That the Times and the Daily News
Do not, as a matter of custom, have
The same political hues.
"Nay, other arts have also known
Rude changes come about;
Though sword and quill are rivals still
There seems no sort of doubt
That both, regarded as useful tools,
Are gently dropping out.
"And so I lie along the veld,
Assuming a careless pose,
And watch the sun in playful fun
Unfurl my frosted toes;
And idly wonder, half-awake,
How the guerrilla goes." O. S.
ACCORDING TO REGULATION.
(A Story of Twenty Years afterwards.)
"WELL, really," said the High Official,
as he leant back in his chair in Pall Mall,
"there is so much to do that I don't
know how we can make a beginning."
"Yes, it is rather difficult," conceded
his Private Secretary. "A couple of
decades ago your predecessor got more
i linn three thousand letters a day, and
now yon have about four times the
quantity."
"Yes," was the response, "and we
muddle along in the good old fashion.
Dear me, youth and man, I have been in
this ramshackle place for half a century,
and I have never seen any change in it."
"Then what would you like to do, Sir?"
asked the Private Secretary.
"Well, suppose we put this room in
order. Those pigeon-holes are full of
valuable documents; let's turn them out,
and, if obsolete, cast them into the waste
paper-basket."
"Scarcely my duty, Sir; more the
business of the messengers," p\it in the
Private Secretary.
"Nonsense !" replied his Chief. "Some
of the papers may be of a confidential
character, and it would never do to run
the risk of allowing them to get into
unworthy hands. So take off your coat,
and get to work."
The Private Secretary obeyed the order
of his Chief, and was soon covered with
dust and documents. At last he came
upon a faded Blue book in a cobwebby
pigeon-hole, that had evidently been
allowed to lie undisturbed for many years.
"What's that?" asked the Chief.
"It seems to me something about re-
organisation. Centralisation is to be
discouraged, and the Department is to be
run on business lines."
1' Dear me! what an odd idea I And
what is it called?"
"' A Report for the Reconstruction of
the War Office,' and it bears the date of
1901."
Then the two officials looked round the
room in which they were sitting, with its
piles and piles of paper awaiting their
attention, and, meeting one another's eyes,
burst into laughter.
A VAIN QUEST.
["Mrs. NANCY IEVINO, a wealthy Chicago
woman, is in search of an honest man. She offers
a prize of £200 for the rarity."— Weitmimter

Shade of Diogenes speaks:
THROUGH every street of Athens I
With lighted lantern ran,
But nowhere could my glance descry
My quest, an honest man;
And now a lady, I am told,
Is seeking what I sought,
And offers many pounds of gold
For what I never caught.
What! does she fondly hope to see
Where I was only blind?
In what strange corner hopeth she
Fair Honesty to find?
Her sister Truth is said to dwell
Where mortal cannot see,
Deep in a dark unfathomed well—
But where is Honesty?
Among the lawyers? Is she here?
Are they no longer bent
On making much the worse appear
The better argument?
Are they to-day so changed from these
Who practised in my youth?
And do they now ignore their fees
And only seek the Truth?
Among the doctors? Do they then
. No more concoct bread pills
And colour water, curing men
Of all their mortal ills?
Are quacks extinct? And do they not
Invent new "treatments," and
Prescribe with cheerfulness for what
They cannot understand?
Among the merchants? What! Are they
Grown into honest men,
Preferring Truth to profit? Nay,
Quantum mutat i then!
Do they no longer lie and cheat,
And puff each worthless ware?
Strike me alive if you will meet
An honest person there!
Among the wise? Among the fools?
The saints who virtue preach?
The learned teachers of the schools?
The idle brats they teach?
Who, who is honest? Millionaire
Or starving little waif ?—
Madam, be calm! Your gold, I swear,
Is absolutely safe.

[JUNE 19, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON STAGE "FOOD AND FEEDING."
WE were discussing theatrical banquets as given on the
stage, whether in farce, opera, or drama, and one and all
agreed that, commencing -with the very grand affair at Glamis
Castle, •which was of the nature of a public dinner given by
that superbly entertaining couple King MACBETH and his
amiable queen on their accession to the Scottish throne,
and continuing with the feasts of foolishness and flow of
melody in Lea Huguenots, Don Giovanni, Traviata, and many
others, down to the wedding breakfast in Trelaieny of the
Wells, all such stage festivities were like the "super " guests
and the "property" goblets, mere empty forms, mere outward
show, ridiculous even to an audience most charitably disposed
towards an accepted "stage illusion," and eminently unsatisfac-
tory to the inner consciousness of a healthy appetite possessed
by the most eminent actors, whatever their line might be.
Then we, well acquainted with the usual stock-in-trade anec-
dotes of the Drama, recalled how a real meal had invariably to
be provided on the stage at any theatre whenever the old musical
farce of ATo Song no Supper was performed. "There is also,"
quoth somebody present, "the story of a superb banquet given
by Madame VESTHis at the Olympic in some play,"—but here the
narrator hesitated, and was lost. The verdict finally arrived at
was, and so will remain for some considerable time, that in the
second act of Mr. F. ANSTEY'S Man from Blankley's, now going
stronger than ever at the Prince of "Wales's Theatre, the
dinner-party scene is unique and is a triumph of stage-
management.
In days gone by, Realism on the stage was a constant theme
for argument. Like the briar that flourished over the graves of
Lord Level and Lady Nancy Bell, this Realism '' grew, and it grow,
and it gre-e-ew, until it couldn't gre-ew any higher," and we
had everything real, boats, ships, cabs, carriages, locomotives,
flro-engines, and galloping horses, until all that was wanted to
complete the triumph of realism was real acting, and this was
comparatively rare. Realism is in the first stage of its decadence:
against the introduction on the stage of such material objects
as engines, cabs, and billiard-tables there is a reaction; "we
don't want 'em any more," as the song, once so popular, had it.
But, instead, we are going to have on the stage "living
pictures" of real life; and, to begin with, here at the
Prince of Wales' Theatre is the real presentment of a
genuine dinner party given by eminently respectable people
living in a semi-suburban quarter of London. It is a cleverly-
contrived scene; the dinner is steadily gone through. The hired
waiter, a butler out of an engagement, one Dawes, is delightfully
played by Mr. ARTHUR PLAYFAIR, who directs the two parlour-
maids, and superintends the entire arrangements. Soup, fish,
entrees, joints, sweets, vegetables are all duly handed, the
conversation is fitful, there are bursts of sound, there is a hum,
there is a silence, and so perfect is the stage-craft that the
audience, having granted the premises, follow all the dialogue
that skilfully assists the plot and develops the characters,
just as if it were the most natural thing in the world for any
guest at a dinner-table to say what he didn't wish anyone else
to hear in a tone so skilfully pitched as to reach the furthest
limits of the gallery and pit.
Miss FANNY BROUOH is immense in this scene, as she is
throughout the piece, sharing the success with Miss JESSIE
i: M i MAN, Miss PATEMAN, Miss VICTOR, and all the representa-
tives of the guests with their most artistically marked
individualities, who, as a rule, have caught so exactly the tone
of the situation as to make the perfectly self-contained Lord
Strathpeffer, played by CHARLES HAWTREY at his very best,
stand out in admirable contrast with Mr. HENRY KEMBLE'S
capital presentment of the pompous old humbug of a Radical,
Gabriel Gihvattle, and with the tricks and manners of the
curious collection of antiquities that figure at the oval table
chee TlDMARSH, of Ledbury Square, Bayswater.
TO GAD'S HILL AND BACK.
(From a Pickwickian Note-Book.)
Saturday, June 8.—Received at Rochester (dear, quaint old
town, so reminiscent of Jinglf, Job's tragedian brother, and Pick-
wickians) by the kind and courteous Dean HOLE, who, in the
Guildhall, made us welcome to " Dickens Town" and "Dickens
Land," in a neat speech, which was a perfect model of plain,
unadorned oratory, although the Dean, so justly celebrated for
his love of horticulture and for his rose-growing, might have
filled it with the choicest flowers of speech. The Dean, who
has seen some eighty summers, is as bright as ever he was
when llrst this present deponent had the pleasure of seeing him
—"vidi tn nt it in " on that occasion—some—well, no matter how
many—years ago. His Reverence was JOHN LEECH'S companion
during that Little Tour in Ireland, of which I regret to say 1
have not a copy on my shelves. This must be remedied.
How perfect a day we had! Thanks, first and foremost, to
one bearing the world-honoured name of DICKENS, yclept HENRY,
Q.C., and then to the energy of that devoted Pickwickian, PERCY
FITZGERALD, who had ingeniously mapped out our route from
Rochester, where, at the "Bull," were evoked such pleasant
memories of Winkle and Dr. Slammer, of Jingle and Dismal Jemmy,
and of the genial Mr. Pickwick himself, that had we stayed the
night at the ancient hostelrie, most certainly should we have seen
the shades of these old friends celebrating with us the CHARLES
DICKENS Anniversary. Thence to the "Leather Bottel," at Cob-
ham, where Mr. Tupman consoled himself for the loss of Rachel
Wardle, and then, to the orchestral accompaniment of thousands
of humming insects, for a stroll amidst a perfect forest of rhodo-
dendrons in all their luxuriance of harmoniously varied colour.
Gad's Hill. To the House, to the room, to the study. The
true spirit of pilgrimage all of us realise in the quiet, in-
the English homeliness, in the very Dickensian atmosphere of
the House and grounds, over which the Boz Club is courteously
shown by our courteous hosts, Mr. and Mrs. LATHAM, now
owners of the property. Here he had constructed, here he had
laid out his plots, here was his fancy, there his delight, and
everywhere his work. Dear was it to him to recall the Shaks-
pearean tradition of the place; dearer to us to recall him, the
great master of truth in fiction. Our conversation is entirely
of him, inseparable from his work. And when the moment
comes that this delightful day must end, then there is one toast,
one only, silently responded to with all our hearts, the name of
"Boz." And so ends an informally kept anniversary.
A few days after the above recorded visit to Gad's Hill, I
was the favoured recipient of a photogravure portrait by the
Gresham Publishing Company, Glasgow, of CHARLES DICKENS,
which is an admirable likeness of the great novelist, exactly
as he was on the last occasion I ever had the great satisfaction
of seeing him. As far as my memory serves, this likeness is
perfect. Who having once seen DICKENS could ever forget him?
Odd, too, that this should come from Glasgow. On the spur
of the moment, I can only recall two sketches of Scotch or
Irish character in all DICKENS. 'Tis a pity that the
Pickwickians never crossed the border. How Tracy Titpnian
would have lost his heart over and over again to the Scotch
lassies and the Irish colleens I Had DICKENS taken them to
Ireland, how Killarney would have inspired Poet Snodgrass.' Mr.
Winkle at the Curragh, and Sam Weller in a faction fight, would
have been delightful! And how Mr. Pickwick would have filled
his note-book with reminiscences of Watergrass! Perhaps best
as it is, and with the best all true Pickwicklaus are content.
THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHERS' CONGRESS AT BERLIN.—The
Times of Saturday, June 15, reports that the members of this
Congress were to be " entertained " (last Friday evening) " in
the Zoological Gardens." Evidently the Berliners consider
their guests as genuine " Lions."

Repine when I perpend pale poems some-
times die.
In mystic maze I muse,
In odour eke occult;
You mind
That I 'm
A kind
Of rhyme
Divinely difficult:
A pale-pink pleasauuce ground
With pensive poppies pranckt and purple
palings round.
t
'Pon pinions pale I poise
Like bliss-born butterfly
O'er rose.
I wreathe
In throes,
And breathe
Each echo's ecstasy.
In phantom fields I dwell,
Like love-lorn lily limp or azure asphodel.
Nor to my passion pale
One thought I bring, because
I try
To see
If I
Can l>e
As faint and fearful as
The poems of to-day.
I think I am, and shall endure as long as
they.
PEOPLE WHO PALL ON ME.
IV.—THE "WORTHY PERSON."
POSSIBLY this term was invented as a
polite equivalent for mental decay, as the
worthy person is, as a rule, quite elderly.
Who ever heard of a young man or woman
that was a worthy person? If a youth
evinces a leaning toward intellectual
obtuseness, we call him a young ass, or
words to that effect. But after a certain
age the young ass is transformed into a
ivorthy person. Ho may be a preacher,
'or instance, with a faculty for verljosity

Auntie. "I WONDER WHAT MAMMA WILL SAY
YOU'VE BKEN."
Little Oirl. "I SHAN'T, THOUGH. I'LL SAT I'VB BEEN VERT GOOD."
Auntie. "You CAN'T DO THAT, MY DEAR. IT WILL KB A LI*."
Little Oirl. "Oo, BOTHER! I FORGOT ABOUT LIES!"
WHEN YOU TELL HER HOW NAUdHTY
such as Lady SUSAN HAKABIN and Mr.
LUCIKN EDENSOR agreed to condemn; but
you will be informed by a host of old lady
apologists that he is really a very worthy
man. Or, if among your acquaintances
there be one man or woman woefully
deficient in tact, and dull beyond the
dreams of idiocy, you are sure to be told
that this individual is a very worthy
person. "I know that worthy person,"
you cry, with a foresight born of bitter
experience; "he comes from Bore-land."
But, says the Apologist, he is kind-
hearted, and surely Nay, I protest
most strenuously this only aggravates the
case. Were the worthy person a Peck-
sniff you could unmask him with a glow
of satisfaction, but his amiable intentions
disarm your attack while they render him
;he more intolerable. An amiable bore
s the very worst kind of bore. Your
shafts of ridicule fall hopelessly tangled
in the rank weedy growth of his bene-
volent intentions. The iciness of your
manner never affects him because it
never reaches its destination. The
warm, enervating atmosphere of tropical
geniality that surrounds him protects
him from the Arctic moods of acquaint-
ances. No, the poet who wrote thought-
lessly about kind hearts forgot the
worthy person. After all, a coronet is
an asset while a kind-hearted worthy
person is too often merely an ass.
There is only one course to take with
worthy persons—avoid them. When you
hear the epithet, think of the red flag that
precedes the steam-roller and beware.
Otherwise, the steed of your temper, which
you usually can keep so well under control,
will jib and rear when the puffing truisms
and snorting commonplaces of the ponder-
ous, slow-moving "worthy person" come
within the range of sight and hearing.

PROM SHADE TO SHADE.
To Charles Dickens, Esq.
MY DKAR CHARLKS,—Why do we meet so rarely? No count-
less leagues of Shadow-land divide us. The journey is not a
long one. The steam-boats on the Acheron are lately much
improved, and there is an excellent service of the best motor-
cars from the place of landing. All these advantages are fully
set out in our time-tables—yet for some reason, as I say, we
rarely meet. This must be altered. Will you make up your
mind and pack up your traps and come to me on Tuesday next?
I have some fine Chambertin, and TKRRE, dear old TERRE—you
remember his queer little place in the Rue Neuve des Petits
Champs—has promised to provide a dish of bouillabaisse. I
have asked FIELDINO, CHARLES LAMB, and one or two other
bright particular souls to bo of the company. GOLDSMITH and
QARRICK and DICK STEELE may come. ADDISON is uncertain,
but, to tell you the truth, if he fails us I shall not grieve un-
duly. He 's a good creature, but has a mighty capacity for
being ponderous, and after two glasses he quotes from himself.
As I 'm a dead sinner, I cannot stand anything more from
Cato or The Campaign. They 're well enough in their way,
but it's not your way or mine, and even on earth that bit
about pale Britannia was done to death.
Well, CHARLES, they have been celebrating you, I see, in
your well-loved haunts, visiting Gad's Hill in cheerful state,
and recalling to one another the places consecrated by your
genius. It was well done, a pious pilgrimage to a happy
shrine. It is right that they should sometimes think of us who
pass our days far removed from the cheerful laughter and the
friendly voices of living men. What would they say if we told
them the truth? Would they pity us or envy if they knew that
we existed among the creatures of our own creating, each of us
in his own little kingdom with his own retainers and his own
population made for him by his brain? Had I but known in
time, I think I might have spared myself a snob or two. Barry
Lyndon amused me at first, but he 's a drunken unprincipled
rascal. Something of a coward too, as you may judge when I
tell you that old Coatigan cuffed him soundly last week for
having threatened to kick Jos Sedley, and Barry, though he
made much noise, never gave a cuff in return. I always sus-
pected the rogue's bluster, and now I know. You, too, could
be happy, I believe, without Jonas or Carker, and even Mrs.
Gamp may prove a trial. But que Jaire? They are but as we
made them, and, such as they are, we must endure them.
No matter, come on Tuesday and let us renew our life and our
youth and the happy days that are no more. Be sure of this,
whatever else you may be doubtful of: no man ever had for
you a more loyal regard and admiration than he who now writes
to you and asks you to bear him company. And in your genial
soul, what room can there be for anything but noble loyalty
and generous good fellowship? Farewell.
Yours, as ever, in friendship and esteem,
W.M. THACKERAY.
McCORIOLANDS PERSONALLY CONDUCTED.
DURING the playing of Coriolanus at the Lyceum the playing
of the orchestra, to the ears of the uninitiated, seemed to be
but the pleasant Mackenzieish flavouring to the somewhat
heavy Shakspearean dish. Severed from its close connection
with Volumnia's big boy, and produced by itself at an after-
noon concert at Queen's Hall, even Sir ALEXANDER MACKENZIE,
conducting his own work in person, must have been satisfied
not only with the orchestra's admirable performance, but also
with its enthusiastic reception by an audience in whose
ears, when it was given at the theatre as part and parcel of
the play, its beauties would probably have passed unnoticed.
In a drama, music that would stand by its own intrinsic
merit, or fall by the absence of it, has but a poor chance
of being taken seriously and at its real value when blended
into the action and overpowered by such dialogue as falls to
the lot of the Hectorlike youthful Roman warrior. Sir ALEC'S
is a musical dish a part, and the more frequently it is heard,
as given on this occasion, the more popular will it become.
And while on the subject of this same afternoon concert, it
must be recorded how admirably VERDI'S Requiem was rendered
by Mesdames MARIE BREMA and SOBRINO, Messieurs PLANCON
and ANSELMI, and a chorus which differed from our gay young
opera choristers and light^of-other-days singers at Covent Gar-
den in being as nearly perfect in every respect as possible.
Those who were not present on this occasion missed a great
treat, though maybe they were consoled by some other equally
great treat in another quarter of the musical world.
WHY did the Oval " look round " 1
Because there were so many " maidens" bold there.

BACILLUS AMORI8.
A German pathologist is reported to hare
discovered a serum which kills the Bacillus
amorit."—J)aily Paper.]
LET pathology •work as it will,
And puzzle its brains as it pleases
To find out a serum to kill
The oldest of mortal diseases;
But bootless and vain is its aim,
And most ineffective its lore is,
For hark! how its victims exclaim,
"Thrice welcome, Bacillus amoris!"
"I can't write my leader," cried JONKS,
"My thoughts will not centre upon it,"
While SMITH in the counting-house owns
He is trying his hand at a sonnet.
Yet they are not incensed when they see
How their wits have been wandering,
nor is
Their anger directed at thee,
Seductive Bacillus amoris.
"What follows is perfectly plain:
It means a most shocking dispersal
Of energy, money and brain,
And the havoc is quite universal;
All suffer alike, rich and poor,
Red Radicals, crusted old Tories—
And is there no possible cure
For this fatal Bacillus amori*?
Some doctors by poverty swear,
And all other serums disparage,
While others will solemnly swear
There 's nothing so certain as marriage;
Some tell you that honeymoons kill
With absolute sureness. What stories!
I "ve tried all the three, and I still
Am a prey to Bacillus amori*.

[" Commerce states that the habit of tea-diinking u becoming prevalent in

WAKE from the dust, old OMAR, with surprise
And rub the earth from your bewildered eyes.
Wipe from your raiment wine's besotting stain,
In modern Persia other cults arise.
Not in the tavern where the ribald throng
Of vetoed juices come to raise your song,
The cups that cheer but not inebriate
Should be your theme—rich syrupy Souchong.
A cosy table in an A. B. C.,
A buttered scone, is good enough for me,
A willing maid to answer to my call,
And for a Jug of Wine—a Cup of Tea.
I sent my soul the nation's drink to scan,
Westward to Frisco, eastward to Japan,
And everywhere the fragrant cup I find,
And everywhere the heathen Chinaman.
Some quaff their Bass, or Special Scotch, and some
Cocktails, some Veuve Cliquot or costly Mimim,—
Ah, give mo but one meal, at five o'clock,
And for tho music but a kettle-drum.
So, OMAR (since all booms must terminate),
While Bridge and Ping-pong now usurp your state,
Yon yet may win another lease of life,
By posing as a Temperance Advocate.
A SEASIDE ROUNDEL.
Ox the sands as loitering I stand
Where my point of view the scene commands,
I survey the prospect fair and grand
On the sands.

Chiromancers reading dirty hands,
Nursemaids, children, preachers, skiffs that land
Trippers with cigars of fearful brands,

On the sands.

"What Spring Brides should buy for the Home." "Spring
Brides!" What elastic young women they ought to be! Female
"Bounders," it is to be feared. And, of course, everything to
match, as, naturally, in the very fitness of things, the Bouncing
Bridegroom would buy his Bounding Bride (lovely title for a
Romance, The Bounder's Bride.') a mansion in Spring Gardens,
where there would be fountains of spring water, and where
every room would be furnished with spring cushions, spring
chairs, the house itself having been, of course, quite recently
"spring-cleaned."

A RECORD BANQUET.
THE banquet given to " Our Sir JOHN TENNIEL" was a splen-
cl public tribute, as the Chairman, Mr. ARTHUR BALFOUR,
a speech replete with most refined and delicate humour,
licitously expressed it, "to a great artist and a great gen-
snian." "And," as the words of the old chorus—suddenly
arted as if by inspiration, and on this occasion sung "with
e heart and voice" in unison, by .all present upstanding—
A-e it, "So say all of us." So sang " all of us" present, and
feel and say all to whom the work of Mi'. Punch'» great
rtoonist is familiar during the last half-century.
For some seconds the guest of the evening, rising to reply,
uld scarcely restrain his emotion, nor summon up from "the
sty depths" of his large heart the words that would not
•orne when'they were called." If, like the blessed and
istocratic BendeVcre (so often quoted), " 'twas his to speak,"
en 'twas ours to cheer. The eloquent speeches were silvern
Seed, but this most eloquent silence was golden. More than
nere few in that great company experienced a certain choky
nsation in the throat, and a stronger throb of the pulse that
oved how their hearts were in warmest sympathy with the
ent orator, whose pathetic pause was just that "one touch of
ture which makes the whole world kin."
At that supreme moment there was not a man amongst us
10 would not have forgotten injuries and shaken hands with
his bitterest foe. The pathos of those blanks in Sir JOHN'S
speech was sublime ; those blanks, indeed, were prizes dis-
tributed to all present as lasting memorials of a gathering
absolutely unique in its character.
As was the occasion, so was the recherche dinner: artistic-
ally ordered, excellently served, wines of the very best, as
perfect a model to all public-dinner caterers as were the few
speeches delivered perfect models of post-prandial oratory.
And yet, brilliant as was the entire evening, all present, as Mr.
AUOUSTIN BIRRELL finely said, "had had from Sir JOHN TENNIEL
a speech which made one in love with silence."
All sympathised with the Chairman in regretting the enforced
absence of Lord RosEBERY, to whom the initiative of this
banquet was due, and, in mentioning this, it will not be con-
sidered a breach of etiquette to add that Lord JAMES OK
HEREFORD and Mr. ALFRED I>E ROTHSCHILD are to bo specially
thanked for their invaluable assistance and hearty co-operation
which had helped to somewhat lighten the labours of the
indefatigable Secretary, Mr. CHARLES WILLIE MATHEWS, who,
on Lord RosEBKRY's suggestion, had most willingly undertaken
a task of no little difficulty as a labour of love, purely out of a
sense of the highest personal esteem for Sir JOHN TENNIEL, as
"great gentleman and great artist," whose admirable work in
the service of the British Public, and for the matter of that of
the civilised world, for over half a century, ought to receive,
as it now has done, the heartiest public recognition.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACT-ID FROM TH* DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Alcmd.01/ nigkt.—If
anything could abash the SAGE OF QUEEN
GATE, or bring the crirasqn blush

"DOT ONE PENNY."
(Sir Fr-d-r-ck D-i-n dot H-rtl-nd.)
to the cheek of DON'T KEIR HARDIE, it was
DIXON-HARTLAND'S demonstration of the
dirt-cheapness of British Royalty. Select
Committee to which King's Civil List
originally referred unanimously agreed to
certain resolutions. SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S
GATE alone in his opposition; drew up
report of his own, which stood in severe
minority of one; had satisfaction of see-
ing it printed for benefit of posterity side
by side with Majority Report. Restated
his objections on earlier stage of Bill.
Reasonable to suppose that would serve.
To-night House in Committee on the
Bill. Coining back refreshed with Whit-
sun holidays the SAGE begins uh ovo, as a
Member long gone over to the majority
once said on the third reading of a
drainage Bill. Puts down amendments to
every clause of Bill; some hours of sultry
night passed by overwhelming majority in
walking through the No Lobby.
It was on amendment to reduce total
amount of Civil List from £470,000 to
£415,000, that DIXON-HARTLAND inter-
posed. A busy man, a banker, author of
the Genealogical History of the Jfoyn/
Houses of Europe, FREDERICK D1XON DIXON-
HARTLAND, Bart., felt the time had come
to bring the loyal foot down on the head of
the incipient dragon of Democracy. The
SAGE insisted £470,000 a year too much to
pay for Royalty; DON'T KEIR HAKDIE,
frowning above voluminous blood - red
necktie that must have cost at least one-
and-uine in the Borough, backed him up.
"Very well," said the many-syllabled
HARTLAND; "we'11 see."
Devoted the reasonably long Whitsun
recess to preparation of table designed to
show comparative cheapness of home-bred
Royalty; worked the sum out in decimal
fractions; nothing like being precise in
these matters.
"The cost of Royalty in Germany per
head of the population," he said, glancing
sternly over his spectacles at the shrink-
ing figure of the SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S
GATE, "isdotSJd.; in Italy it is dot 4}d.;
in Spain," here he turned his regard upon
DON'T KEIR HARDIE, who ostentatiously
aftected complete indifference, " it is dot
4d., plus the sixteenth part of a penny;
in Russia it is dot 5d."
Committee beginning to simmer with
laughter F. D. D-H., sternly regarding the
two prisoners in the dock opposite,
emphatically repeated the dot; Committee
broke into irreverent laughter.
"DIXON - HARTLAND's getting quite
dotty," someone whispered, and the
laughter rose again.
The Baronet, temporarily withdrawing
his gaze from benches below the Gangway
opposite, turned with amazement to regard
the laughing faces that circled him.
"In this country," he added, in tones
of tragic solemnity, "the cost of Royalty
is dot one penny."
After this nothing more was heard or
said amid the whirlwind of laughter.
F. D. D-H. sat down; but he had made
his point—I mean his dot, and aggressive
Democracy was ground to powder.
Jiusinexs done.—Civil List passed after
much exercise in Division Lobby.
Tuesday night. — "Man and boy, I've
been in the House of Commons twenty-
eight years," said the MEMBER FOR SARK,
"and I never saw the game played quite
so low down as to-night."
Appointed business, statement by PRINCE
ARTHUR affecting affairs through remain-
der of Session. There being only thirty-
nine Questions on Paper, reasonable to
suppose that motion appropriating remain-
ing time of Session would come on about
four o'clock. An hour's talk would serve,
and at five o'clock the House would settle
down to debate on Factories and Work-
shops' Bill, which affects the health and
comfort of hundreds of thousands of men
and women. This forecast founded on as-
sumption that House of Commons is a
business assembly, its affairs controlled
by dictates of common-sense. That's
just where the bottom falls out of the
bucket. What happened was that two
Private Bills, one affecting a Gas Com-
pany, the other a Railway Company, took
precedence, waiving aside the Leader of
the House, Members with Questions,
Ministers with Answers.
The two first and freshest hours of sit-
ting appropriated for these Bills, it looked
as if business really at hand. "Oh, no, you
don't," said JOHN DILLON.
Among list of private business was a
Provisional Order affecting the Arizona
Copper Company. What '« the Arizona
Copper Company to the Irish Member, or
the Irish Member to it, that he should
weep for it? Nothing more than HECUBY
was to the player who rehearsed before
Hamlet. But it would serve as well as
anything to obstruct business and pre-
vent the case of the factory workers being
fairly considered. Accordingly, another
half-hour wasted, whilst DILLON and RED-
MOND aine talked about Arizona Copper
Company, on which they frankly confessed
they knew absolutely nothing. Mean-
while the SPEAKER sat in Chair impotent
to prevent this prank, and the mightiest
Legislative Assembly in the world, whose
word can launch a thousand ships or place
in the field an army that could storm the
topmost towers of Ilium, quietly suffered.
The Factories' Bill was not taken in
hand till half-past nine, with the know-
ledge that Debate might not extend be-
yond midnight. Thus two hours and a-
half were allotted to business and six
and a-half to approaching it. PRINCE
ARTHUR remarked that it is impossible
for outside public to understand certain
miancet of procedure. That is true; but
the public will understand the bald state-
ment of fact here set forth, and, in imita-
tion of WILSON BARRETT in a shelved play,
will throw up gaunt arms and cry aloud,
"How long? How long?"
UtixiiH'xs done.—Remainder of Session
commandeered for public business. The
Divine SARA reviewed Parliamentary
forces from the Ladies' Gallery. Much
puzzled by its construction. "Your Poet

was wrong, cher TOBIE," she said,
"Iron bars do make a cage."
Thursday night.—House laughed when,
the other day, C.-B. announced discovery
that if of six battalions you send three
out of the country six don't remain.
Laughed again to-night when CAP'EN
TOMMY BOWLES delicately alluded to frag-
ment of the Gibraltar Defences Com-
mission still serving. Originally there
were four Members. Having mentioned
that in certain circumstances he had
resigned, the CAP'EN added, "I do not
know what has since occurred with what
remained of the Commission."
Numerically, the fragment was three-
quarters of the whole. But in estimating
value something more than numerals must
be taken into account. For example,
there's Great Britain, Jersey, Alderney
and 8ark — four islands. If by some
convulsion of Nature Great Britain were
whelmed in the sea, Jersey, Alderney and
Sark remaining intact, we, regardless of
their aggregate number, would naturally
allude to them as " what remained of the
Islands." Thus the CAP'EN was, as usual,
right, the frivolous House only too ready
to ripple the stagnant water of its pro-
cedure with gust of laughter.
Business done.—Two hours appropriated
for private Bill; one hour and a half for
Questions, mostly frivolous; another hour
and a half for motion for adjournment in
order that CAP'EN TOMMY might reel off
his speech about Gibraltar. This brought
Sitting up to eight o'clock, leaving four
hours for work out of a possible nine.
Friday night.—PLUTARCH having given
up writing, HKNBY BROADHURST takes
pen in hand and gives us the history
of his life (HUTCHINSON). A very good
book it is; interesting story of honest,
arduous daily life, simply, modestly
told. His acquaintance with the Home
Office is intimate and unique. In his
early capacity as a stonemason he helped
to build it; many years later he sat
in oue of its carpeted rooms Under-
secretary for State for tho Departs
ment. Every soldier knows he carries in
his knapsack the baton of a Field Mar-
shal. BROADHURST has proved that the
working mason may carry in his basket
the quill pen of a Minister of the Crown.
The story is creditable alike to English
public lifo and HENRY BROADIR'RST'S
share in it. The only dark spot, lightly
touched,' is that wherein the petty
jealousies of the class he had served
since boyhood found issue in per-
sistent calumny and organized effort to
withdraw from him tho support of the
working man. BROADHUHST met the
unequal contest pluckily and straight-
forwardly, and in the end overcame.
With pardonable pride, the ex-stom
mason habituullv declined invitations to
dinner with the great. Occasionally he
varied from his practice, notably in
attending a little dinner given by Lord
(then Sir HENRY) JAMES at Greenwich.
Amongst the company were tho SQUIRE
OP MALWOOD, DON JOSE, and Mr. ASQUITB.
It was towards the end of the Session of
188C, when there was talk of re-union of
the Liberal Party. BROADHURST surmises
that this dinner was specially designed
to that end. All of which makes more
pointed his contribution to the conver-
sation.
The host asked him across the table
whether he had lately brought his bull-
terrier down to the House of Commons.
"I replied," he writes, "I thought the
time was coming when it would be neces-
sary to bring it in order to clear out the
rats. The meeting," he adds, "at once
became more genial, and a very pleasant
evening was the immediate outcome."
The book was worth writing, if only for
inclusion of this delicious passage.
Business done.—Committee of Supply.
MORE DUCAL REFLECTIONS.
[" The Government were justified in assuming
that they still had the confidence of the country,
but they should have had no right to be surprised
if a different conclusion had been formed,"—Ttt*
Duke of Devonshire.']
You gentlemen of common-sense
Require no demonstration
That we possess the confidence
Of all the British nation;
Though were we in tho painful plight
Of being left without it,
I do not think we 've any right
To be surprised about it.
The war, of course, we've carried
through
In triumph, every action
Therewith connected giving u-
niversal satisfaction;
Though had the public changed their
views
As blunder followed blunder,
It had, 1 think, been inexcus-
able in us to wonder.
Tax-payers are delighted at
The new financial cycle
For which they daily breathe their grat-
itude to good Sir MICHAEL;
Though had their sage opinions veered,
With taxes always rising,
To me it would not have appeared
Remarkably surprising.
Our social programme—Bills to house,
Our liquor legisation,
And old-age pension schemes arouse
The country's admiration.
Though had they looked on what we 've
done
With odium unbounded,

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHAEIVAKI.
ANOTHER "REAL CONVERSATION."
A SERIES of "Real Conversations"
between that distinguished dramatic critic
Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER and various promi-
nent dramatists is now appearing in the
Pall Mall Magazine amid thunders of
applause. Mr. Punch, green with jealousy,
has decided that he cannot allow a mere
magazine to have the monopoly of these
earth-shaking interviews. He has, there-
fore, intercepted the manuscript of a
"Real Conversation" between Mr.
ARCHER and SeBor ECHEGARAV, whose
play Mariana, now being performed at the
Royalty, was so enthusiastically praised
on its production by the critic of the
World.
SCENE—The Arboretum of the Playgoers'
Club. DATE — The future. Seilor
ECHEOARAY discovered in an armchair
reading the "Daily Telegraph." To
him Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER :—
W. A. (magisterially). Seiior ECHEOARAY,
I see you are reading the Telegraph. I
should have thought that was hardly the
sort of paper a dramatist should read!
Seilor Echegaray (unsuspiciously). There
is some other paper you would recommend,
perhaps?
W. A. (severely). There is only one
journal, my dear Sir, that need engross
the attention of a person connected with
play writing. I refer to the World. My
own weekly articles on the drama appear
in its columns. They, and they only,
represent a true and correct judgment on
such poor plays as are now produced.
8. E. Indeed?
W. A. Most certainly. You saw my
article on Mariana, of course?
S. E. (putting down paper). Yes.
W. A. Powerful, wasn't it? Weighty!
I compared your play to Romeo and Juliet,
you remember.
8. E. (yawning). It was really very hand-
some of you.
W. A. (simpering). Not at all. You saw
the connection, of course?
£1. E. (nervously). Well, the fact is, I am
nob sure that I did.
W. A. (n-\i'ili. I think that's rather
dull of you. Mariana dies in the last
act. So does Juliet. Both are pas-
sionately beloved. What more would you
have?
S. E. (puzzled). That's true, of course.
(Doubtfully) But the differences are even
more considerable. Juliet loves her hus-
band, and kills herself for love of him.
Mariana hates her husband, and is killed
by him for loving someone else. The
parallel is not very close, after all.
TV. A. (huffed). You think not? Well,
of course, you must have your own
opinion. But you will find I am right.
Besides, you can't deny that they are
both love tragedies!
S. E. No doubt. But
W. A. (triumphantly). Well then!
S. E. (giving up the struggle and accept-
ing this fatuity with a good grace). The
comparison is more profound than I had
imagined.
W. A. (pleased). I felt certain I should
convince you. And now let us talk of
something else. I am sure, Seflor, that
you cannot have been in London for even
a week without realising that the Eng-
lish drama is in a sad condition.
S. E. You don't say so?
W. A. Positively moribund, I assure
you. Not a star in its firmament, if I may
so express myself. Except, of course,
Mr. PHILLIPS.
S. E. PHILLIPS? I don't think I know
the name.
TV. A. You shock me! Our only genius.
I discovered him. I always do discover
people. It is my specialty. I discovered
you, for instance.
S. E. I am vastly obliged to you.
TV. A. But I shall come to that pre-
sently. Just now I am speaking of the
state of the British Drama. In "Real
Conversations" it is important to keep
to the point.
S. E. (bored). No doubt.
TV. A. The fact is, all our plays are
regrettably cheerful just now. Quite
healthy, in fact. There 's nothing morbific
about them. That's a bad sign!
S. E. Of course.
TV. A. (opening his ponderous and mar-
ble jaw for a net speech). Dean SWIFT, you
may remember, said that a nice man was
a man full of nasty ideas. This applies
especially to .playwrights. It follows,
therefore, that you cannot have really
nice plays without nasty plots. And as
nasty plots seem particularly scarce just
now the British Drama is naturally in a
bad way.
S. E. Inevitably.
H'. A. What we want is a few gloomy
dramatists like yourself to put things
right. What with our happy endings and
our unimpeachable morality our home-
grown plays just now are unspeakably
depressing. Sweet and Twenty, for
instance. What a drama! The scene, a
country parsonage. The end, virtue
rewarded. How morbid! If only dear
IBSEN—I discovered him, you know—
would write another Ghosts, how un-
speakably refreshing it would be 1
S. E. (glancing furtively at his "Daily
Telegraph"). Most refreshing.
TV. A. (sadly). But he never will. TVJien
we Deadaivaken showed a sad falling away.
Not half full-blooded enough. Too allu-
sive altogether.
S. JB. Quite so.
TV. A. (majestically, noticing that his
hearer's mind is [straying to abandoned
neu-spaper). I was going to announce,
therefore, if you are giving me your
attention, that with my assistance a great
future might await your dramas in
England.
S. E. (hurriedly concealing abandoned
newspaper aforesaid). You are very good.
TV. A. Now that dear IBSEN'S genius is
so universally recognised ho hardly re-
quires all my time, and I propose to
devote some pf it to pressing your claims
—in a translation of course—on the atten-
tion of the British public.
S. E. This is really most kind of you.
TV. A. There is only one serious obstacle
that I foresee.
S. E. (smiling). You will surmount it.
TV. A. (sternly). I must beg you to be
serious. (Seflor ECHEOARAY looks glum.)
The obstacle is in your name.
S. E. My name?
W. A. Yes. It will be years before
even the elect will feel certain how to
pronounce it. I have had the same diffi-
culty in popularising dear MAETERLINCK.
IBSEN, of course, anyone can say after a
fashion. It is true they make it rhyme
with GIBSON—a most regrettable error—
but, at least, it does not frighten them.
Your name is quite another matter. I
suppose you couldn't change it?
S. E. Afraid I could hardly manage that.
TV. A. (gloomily). It's very unfortunate.
However, I shall explain to my readers
that they must sneeze before attempting
to pronounce it. That will get the vocal
chords into the proper position. Thus:—
Hu-tsschg-ray.
S. E. (encouragingly). Excellent. Bravo!
W. A. (proudly). I knew I should manage
it. And now I must say good-bye. On
looking through my notes I see I have
done most of the talking. But that is as
it should be. In an interview the person
interviewed gives his views. In a "Real
Conversation" the interviewer does so.
That's the whole difference. Good-bye
again. [E.vit busily, pocketing note-book. ST. J. H.

Old Style—Half a Century Ago. I give
more details of the latest fight. The
general at sunrise ordered an attack.
(Tlien follow ten thousand ivords of de-
scriptive matter.) I need scarcely say
that the mistakes were patent, and can
easily be recounted. (TJien follow ten
thousand words of criticism.) To sum up,
although the battle was not a Waterloo,
still British valour was once more to the
front. (Then follow ten thousand words
of eulogy.)
New Style—Present Day. Battle over.
Details anticipated by Official Despatch.
No good sending any more news, as all
the other fellows (thanks to the Press
censor) have got the same intelligence.
Question whether it was worth while
going to the expense of sending us here.
So wire to say am coming home. The
General can do his own reporting. Don't
want us.

Being «• Letter from Ina SiyisWe to Mrs.
Helina Truman.
MY DEAREST SELINA, — I am in the
greatest difficulty, and want your advice.
In the first place, the War Office is being
thoroughly reorganized, and EVAN has
been made a major. Isn't it glorious!
It is in the Gazette this week, and looks so
smart in print. I believe he is really very,
very fond of me, and if ever we are alone
he will pop the momentous question. If
ever we are alone! Oh, the awful
thought. It seems utterly impossible.
We are never at home. We even break-
fast out now on the Thames Embankment,
and sip our coffee and batter in the tops
of our eggs to the tune of a Parisian
mazurka. That's papa's idea.
Once EVAN came with the REDWRYSTS
and their little Anglo-Indian set, and if
ever a man's eyes spoke a tumultuous,
pent-up passion EVAN'S did that morning.
In future, all love-making will be done
by signs, because we can't make love in
public, and privacy is one of the privi-
leges of the poor. I tried to show EVAN
my true feelings by raising and lowering
my eyebrows, until mama asked me to try
the corner of my handkerchief if I had
anything in my eye, and not make such
distressing grimaces. I have persuaded

him to be manicured (iny nails simply
gleam, darling) so that we could meet,
but Lord WRINKLE seems to live there.
We have run into him every time.
If only we could have a meal at home,
of course the thing could be managed.
Even with servants coming in and out, 1
believe he would risk some sort of pre-
liminary canter over the course of true
love. But our meals have been arranged
at all the fashionable hotels and restau-
rants right through the season, including
dinner-parties given and accepted. We
lunch invariably at Prince's, we have
tea invariably at CLARIDGF.'S, we have
dinner invariably at the Carlton, we have
supper at the New Club or the Savoy.
Always surrounded by a host of chatter-
ing people, with an occasional fringe of
relatives. Mama, whose energy is simply
astounding, goes through it all without
turning a hair. And EVAN and the moon
are equally remote. What shall I do?
That spiteful Aunt EMMELINE has an eye
on EVAN for MAUD (who, my dear, is as
thinandhop-poleyasever),andccmtii!ii(if(i/
throws them together. You see, not
being so frightfully fashionable as us,
they have.some of their meals at home—
doesn't it sound funny?—and ask him
alone. Can't you see what a terrible
strait I 'm in? I 'm sure he loves me as
much as I adore him, and yet the dictates
of fashion won't let us alone, or rather,
won't let us be alone.
At the TUMNAL TiNTZ'S the other night
we had Bridge tables instead of petits
chewux, and I got EVAN for a partner for
two rubbers. Wasn't it luck! Of course
whenever I had to declare trumps, I said
"Hearts!" and gave him such a niseet
look. And when he left the declaration to
me, I said "Hearts!" with such a deep
sigh, often sacrificing hundreds of points in
another suit. We lost over eight pounds
each, and I don't believe he saw what 1
meant. Love-making like this is too expen-
sive. But what is a girl todo? I can think
of nothing. Shall I send him a telegram,
"Someone loves you tremendously be-
ginning with I"? or put a line in'tho
agony column of one of the papers, "If
Major EVAN STILLWAYS will communicate,
etc., he will hear of something to his ad-
vantage"? This might seem conceited.
I would be ill if 1 thought I should be
taken home. Then 1 could get con-
valescent and receive an "occasional
visitor." But I believe it's fashionable
to go to hospitals now and be ill among
all sorts and conditions of people. Dear-
est and sweetest SELINA, do advise me by
return.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The WJiMigig (WARD, LOCK & Co.), by MAYNE LINDSAY, is a
kaleidoscopic - cinematographic romance. Such the Baron,
with his head aching after desperate struggles through its
mazes and tangles, considers is a perfectly fair description of
this wonderful work. "Wonderful, indeed; would it were
impossible! " as the Unwieldy Lexicographer observed of a
fantasia on the violoncello. The Whirligig is a most appropriate
title for the story, which would, perhaps, not have come into
in existence but for the popularity of a certain kind of romance
whereof The Prisoner of Zenda is the model. Once, in the very
thickest of the tangle, the Baron endeavoured to retrace his
steps to find a fresh starting point, but all in vain. And this is
a pity, for the melodramatic situations are good in themselves;
the duels, the hairbreadth escapes, the fights, the scrimmages
are described with great spirit, and the illustrations are
clever. But what the plot may
be the Baron leaves to some
SHERLOCK HoLMES-like critic
to unravel.
Just to return for a moment
to a book the Baron had the
pleasure of remarking upon the
other day, namely, Sa Majeste
I'Amour, for the sake of quoting
MAX O'RELL's frank apprecia-
tion " de cephiloaophe maussade
THOMAS CARLYLE," of whom he
writes :—
"CABLYLE a trait£ le monde comme
il traitait Bit femme. II lui jcrivait
des lettrea dana leaquelles il lui
exprimait tout son amour; mais
quand il 1'avait auprfs de lui, il no
pouvaic jamais r^ussir a trourer un
mot aimable A lui dire, ce qui eut
nidi' a la rendre plus heureuBe."
Absolutely true. The Baron
can recall more than one Carlyl-
esque philosopher, who might
be fitly described as " sage and
onions," with the onions for
the predominant partner in
this summarised character.
Certainly MAX O'RELL is an
amusing and a genial cynic.
Yeoman Service (SMITH ELDER)
is the title given by Lady
MAUD ROLLESTON to gleanings
from the diary she kept in South
Africa, visiting it as the wife of an Imperial Yeomanry officer
at the front. It has the charm of the lark's song, inasmuch as
publication was unpremeditated. We have conveyed in simple
language, suitable to the literature of private correspondence,
a lady's impressions of what she saw and heard amid the stirring
scenes of war. There have been some hard things said about
the crusade of the West End to South Africa. Slumming being
out of fashion, flne ladies took to hospital-nursing. Lady MAUD
really did some practical work, setting up, principally out of
her private funds, a Convalescent Home at Kimberley. All the
same, when, in her journeying, she accidentally came within
range of Lord KITCHENER'S glance at a railway station she
fouud it judicious to secrete herself about the premises. Lady
MAUD ingenuously puts the case against herself and far less
worthy searchers after a new form of excitement. Permis-
sion to go up to Lindley wheedled out of the General, and
afterwards retracted, she writes: "I was horribly disappointed,
but it was a great mercy I did not go. I should certainly have
been very much in the way, and I might, indeed, have cost

valuable men's lives, and enough had been lost out there with-
out that." My Baronite quite agrees with Lady MAUD.
Letters of an Eton Boy (CASSELL & Co.). "Hcec olim meminisse
juvabit." "Ancient Etonians," says the Baron to himself,
"will enjoy looking back on happy days at 'my Tutor's,' un-
happy winter mornings at 6.30 school, haphazard saying lessons
at a later hour in the dingy class-room of some strict, sharp-
eyed and sharp-eared master, who was quite ' up to ' those who
were 'up to' him; glorious Fourths of June, the first champagne,
the last swishing, the leave and licence, the delights, the
dangers, and the anything-but-laborious days in the playing
fields, in the Five Courts, on the Ascot Road, and, "after
four," up to Surley and back again for the roll-call, when
some of us were conspicuous by our "absence," and others
were punished for taking on themselves to answer for us,
quite by mistake, of course. Yes," repeated the Baron, pull-
ing up short, " I've no doubt of it; there isn't an old, or let us
say an elderly, Etonian to
whom this book will not come
as a tickle in the ribs, waking
him up to any number of
pleasant memories!" In the
seventeenth letter Mr. NUGENT
BANKES makes his juvenile
hero relate how he and the
youthful Thespians at his
tutor's performed a burlesque
called YillUcins and his Dinali,
written aforetime by one who,
when at Eton, wrote his first
farce, and, with a distinguished
cast, performed it in his tutor's
pupil-room, the author being
then about two years younger
than the heroine of the old
ballad on which the burlesque
was founded, namely, Alias
Dinah, who was "seventeen
years old, with a very large
fortune in sil-i-ver and gold."
The dates of days and months
head these letters, but what
was the year? Whenever it
was, the "slang " of the place
seems to have remained un-
changed since "the days when
we went gipsying, a long time
ago," i.e. in 1851; but there
was, apparently, more work
to be got through in Mr. NUGENT
BANKES' time than there was
at the period of the Baron's "pupil-room " days, though, judging
from these letters, it doesn't follow at all that more work uxu done
then or is done now any better than of yore. Seemingly, these
later Etonians are inclined to resent having masters placed over
them who had not been educated at Eton, as in the instance of
"the new master named HALL," who teaches "Mincrallogy."
This young letter-writer stays at Eton for seven years, so was
a pretty old boy by the time he took leave of the Head Master,
who, of course, bade him farewell with best swishes for his
happiness. THE BARON DE B.-W.

THIS IB ONLY A LITTLE G4ME OF "PlNO-PONG" IN I'KOU RES8, AND BOMB OP THI BALLS ABE MISSING I
"THIS HOUSE TO LET."
SIR, you 're not a bird of passage, but you sometimes, I suppose,
When you 're tired of pricking folly with your verses or your
prose,
You must sometimes, as I fancy, take a whim to go and range
To some other part of London or the country for a change.
That means hunting for a house, Sir; it's a weary job at best,
Full of carking disappointments, void of happiness or rest.
There are houses by the hundred, but they never seem to be
Just the thing—at least, 1 find them quite unsuitable for me.
There are houses in Bclgravia, very frowning, very tall,
Storeyed palaces of stucco, with a most extensive hall;
With electric light and nurseries, and a set of gloomy rooms,
Like a range of mausoleums in an avenue of tombs.
There a man might live and flourish, if he cared to take his place
As iin undistinguished atom in illimitable space.
Ho would llnd it hard at starting, but discomforts he might baull;
With a telescope to see with and a megaphone to talk.
There are tidy little houses where a doll could live at ease,
With her tiny cups and saucers giving everlasting teas.
With my shoulders on the ceiling and my feet upon the floor,
1 should stay inside for ever if 1 once got through the door.
They have billiard-rooms, these houses, which they always
advertise
As containing billiard-tables of a full and proper size.
They attract me, I admit it, but I doubt if they would do
With their margins of six inches for your body and your cue.
Then the fixtures, oh, the fixtures: there are some that seem to
stay,
There are some the former tenant seems to pack and take away.
There are some ho kindly loaves you, which are generally those
That you take (although you hate them) and you pay for through
the nose.
So I fancy on the whole, Sir, though I really want to go
To some other part of London which is closer to the How,

Of the tidy little doll's house, and be happy where I am.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OCCASIONAL OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday, June 15.—OteHo in Italian. Signer TAMAGNO,
appearing as the Moor, could not have had a more enthusiastic j
reception than that given him after his long absence from
Covent Garden. There is "No Moor at present" except Tarn
Agno, and there won't be until August, when Otello has departed
and sportsmen gone to the Moors. Odd, that the revival of
Otello should havo synchronised with the visit of the Moorish
Embassy to London.
Madame EAME8 superb as Dear Desdemona, but not equally
great in her dramatic rendering of the Shakspearean character.
Can't expect everything in perfection, especially in opera, where
the motto is " singing first and acting afterwards." Plenty of
enthusiasm in the audience: loud calls, then smiling recipients
of "musical honours." All good, and MANCINELLI evidently
delighted.
Again at the Opera must be asked the question, "OiV *ont let
neiges d'antanf" And the answer must be, "Up above the
'flies' so high." Given La Boheme, and the supply of snow is
so plentiful for that charming opera as to continue for several
nights sparsely falling, quite unexpectedly, in the most unlikely
places. For the sake of the Syndicate's reputation this fall
should bo stopped, or else the report will get about that " the
House is full of ' paper."" Absit omen.
Wednesday, June 19.—MELBA to hear as Marguerite Is ever a
genuine musical treat. To MELBA'S Marguerite with lovely
notes, The Syndicate for Faust selected COATES. Whate'cr the
tenors whom they choose to oust, They can't make COATES to
fit exactly Faust. "No time for measurement! take what
we 've got! COATES ready-made is here upon the spot,"
Decides Sartorial Syndicate by votes. After his Faust they
asked, "Who'11 cut out COATES?" As Mephiatopheles, good
Monsieur PLANCON Made every note of his most fiendish chanson
Tell with a force that charmed us one and all, Winning applause
and heartiest recall. Summon'd by sounds not in the least
uncertain, He and the others came before the curtain. Faust
in best French the " principals " all sing; Not BO the chorus,
that's a different thing. These, without principals, or with,
insist On singing in Italian as they list. Although all sang as
if they were inspired, The mise-en-ncene left things to be desired.
With MANCINELLI as conductor clever, The orchestra was just
as good as ever. A great success achieved, the opera ended.
Alas, outside the pelting rain descended! Commissionaires,
though usually dabs At swiftly running and procuring cabs,
Did not, as on the other nights, abound, And sadly owned that
cabs could not be found! The why or wherefore nobody
explained; But one thing very certain was, it rained. The
carriage folk of course were well provided, While for the rest
they had to do as I did, And walk, much dreading lest we should
be soused, Until we cabbed it. Oh, how wo blessed Faust.'
Thursday.—Carmen. Never mind whether 'tis French or
Italian, and on this occasion it was in BIZET'S native tongue.
Carmen, as rendered to-night, is delightful. CALVE, as Carmen,
simply perfect. All the artfulness, all the heartlessncss, all
the fascination of the character, all the character itself—well,
who has not seen CALvti as Carmen has never Carmen seen.
And such a caste! As Don Jose, the weak, the tortured lover,
M. SALEZA is one of the best. The entire caste excellent,
dramatically and musically. ANCOXA, as the gay Escamillo,
charming us with "Toreador confcnto," as if wo had never
heard it before. Then the humour of tho two scoundrels,
played, sung, and stepped by Messieurs GILIBERT and FORGEUR,
comes, as fresh as if the pie had only just been opened and tho
birds had begun to sing. The incomparable BAUERMEISTER as
Frusquita and charming Mile. MAUBOURO as Mercedes both
delightful as the fascinating gipsies, Miss SUZANNE ADAMS,
as-the loving and trusting Micaela, singing angelically and in
sweet simplicity, contrasting with all the devil-roay-care-iness
around her. STEDMAN'S boys up to the mark and doing their
best, as if the holidays had already commenced, and Conductor
M. PH. FLON conducting the orchestra with such spirit aa to
leave nothing to be desired except that we may see and hear
many such readings of Carmen.
OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
Doom Castle (BLACKWOOD) is a romance happily named. By the
title, Mr. NEIL MUNRO, possibly unconsciously, sounds the key-
note of a story with dark and gloomy background. Whilst the
reader is affected by this pervading influence, he is none the
less, perhaps all the more, moved by the stirring story.
Mr. MUNRO has really written a romance, a rare achievement
in these prosaic days. He is the more venturous since he has
not shrunk from meeting WALTER SCOTT on his native heath, or
footing it with STEVENSON in company with the kind of Scot he
most affected. My Baronite doesn't particularly care for the
Duke of Argyll and his Duchess, who are rather Dresden-china
figures. But Count Victor is a lifc-and-blood Frenchman,
serving admirably as a foil to the sombre Scot and tho terrible
weather he comes in contact with during his sojourn in the
country of Argyll. Sim AfacTaggart, the roue Chamberlain,
equally successful in the boudoirs of Paris and the drear hind
round Doom Castle, is admirably drawn, as is the ruined lord, of
Doom. Best of all is Mungo, the factotum put to infinite shifts
to make the lean larder maintain the ancient hospitality of the
the Castle.
Paul le Maistre, by FREDERIC CARREL (JOHN LONG), is not
within measurable distance of Tlie Progcess of Pauline Kessler
by the same author. The canvas is too crowded, and there is
so very "much ado about nothing," that the reader finds himself
searching for the chief persons, who are lost to sight in a
crowd of nobodies and anybodies. It is a restless Zolaesque
and Gcorge-Mooresque sort of novel. Of all the characters that
begin well and end badly there is none that doeth good, no not
one, and they all go out of their way to become abominable.
There is an exception to the rule, but he is a half-hearted
nonentity, a person of no importance. The chief characters
are of animal type, and their squalid story, such as it is, could
have been told in a very few chapters, sufficient, that is, to
interest the trained skipping reader of the masculine gender,
for with the gentler sex the Baron feels sure this book would
find scant favour.
The Baron was under the impression that the old original
"Cheshire Cheese" had disappeared with the old original
"Cock Tavern," but "from information received" through
the latest re-edited re-publication on this subject, entitled The
Book of the Cheese compiled by the late T. W. REID and edited
by R. D. ADAMS, M.A. (FisHER UNWIN), it appears that the ancient
tavern still exists. The traditions associated with the old
place are very interesting, as also are the illustrations by
SEYMOUR LUCAS, R.A., HERBERT RAILTOX, PENNEL, ALLEN, and
CRUIKSHANK. Tho form, however, of the book might, the Baron
suggests, bo recast with considerable advantage to the
extension of its future popularity.
"The Manager of Brods/iaio's Guide presents his compliments,
and begs the Baron's acceptance of a facsimile of the first
edition of Bradshaw's Guide." It is a gem! Perfect! A pocket
guide dated October 10, 1830. Quite a curiosity. It seems
that people in those days didn't want to come up to London,
but ranged only about Liverpool, Manchester, Bolton, there
and thereabouts. Considering the novelty and the luxury, the
fares were reasonable too! Worth while examining it for the
sake of the few lines contained in the brochure, which at dinner-
parties and in club smoking-rooms are all worth quoting.
And here is a "surprise-packet" prepared by some of Air.
Punch's young men, just to show him what they can do when they
like, after the manner of Todgers ("Oh, Todgers's could do it when

it chose "), entitled Punch's Holiday Book,
edited by E. T. REED, of Prehistoric Fame,
and calculated to rejoice the hearts of all
those -who can take a holiday and with it
this book, or, if unable to obtain a long
or short " vac," may enjoy the sketches,
poems and articles, all good and well
chosen, during such time as they can
spare from work. Mr. Punch, who has
only just dipped into it and come up
again refreshed, has one whisper for the
ear of the clever collector of these well-
considered trifles and well-executed cuts,
which is, that to speak of " Mr. Punch" as
"Punch," without the prefix of " Mister,"
is —ahem—well just a trifle too familiar.
Does the Reedy-witted Editor of this
Holiday Book call to mind the just indigna-
tion of the devoted Sam Weller against
"some person or persons unknown " who,
as he supposed, had taken liberties with
the honoured name of "Pickwick " f Apart
from his own hebdomadal publication,
which is uniquely "Punch," he appears
everywhere, and is addressed by every-
body as "Mr. Punch," not a " veteran"
by any manner of means, but ever young,
ever wise, genial to all, satirical but
kindly, and everybody's best friend. The
contributors to the Holiday Book have
done their best to "deserve success," at
least, so says the benevolent

OH, what is a maid to do
When never a swain will woo;
When \7icnnese dresses
And eddying tresses
And eyes of a heavenly blue,
Are treated with high disdain
By the cold and the careless swain,
When soft showered glances
At dinners and dances
Are sadly but truly vain?
Ah, then, must a maid despair?
Ah, no, but betimes repair
With her magical tresses
And summery dresses
To upper Thames reaches, where
She turns her wan cheek to the sun
(Of lesser swains she will none);
Her glorious flame,
Well skilled in the game,
Flings kisses that burn like fun.
And cheeks that had lost their charm
Grow rosy and soft and warm;
Eyes lately so dull
Of sun-light are full
As masculine hearts with alarm.
For jealousy by degrees
Steals over the swain who sees
The cheek he was slighting
Another delighting,
And so he is brought to his knees.

Gross gobbets, joints ill-cooked and crude
Raised by the pedant's breeding—
The gorged and jaded appetite
Shall bolt unchewed, instead of bite,
And dining be mere feeding.
For now the dainty taste may play
With lighter food, in many a way
That our skilled teachers dish us,
Who offer from their bill of fare
A morsel here, a tit-bit there,
All toothsome and delicious.
So, while the sated soul, set free
To sip of science like a bee
And shame the grosser glutton,
Culls culture (like JACK HORNER'S plum),
The classics, in the time to come,
Shall be as dead as—mutton.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARL
BABS THE INSUFFERABLE. .
An Undrantattc Sequel.
THE Hysteria, on which BABS the
Insufferable and her brother MONTACOTE
•were returning from their Eastern tour,
steamed slowly into Plymouth Sound.
The news of her arrival struck a chill
into the heart of Mrs. KINGCONSTANCE,
which even the presence of salmon
mayonnaise on the menu at luncheon failed
to dispel.
""We must really get married at once,"
she said to Mr. JELLIBOND TINNEY, as she
helped herself for the fourth time. "Then
we can go away and settle somewhere else,
and BABS can live at Dane Court with her
brother. He will be of age in a few
weeks."
"Do you think MONTACUTE will stand
that? " enquired JKLLIBOND, dubiously.
"Of course he will," replied Mrs. KING-
CONSTANCE, helping herself to a cutlet.
"MONTACUTE is curiously stupid. He
quite likes BABS. If he didn't he would
not have taken her abroad with him."
"Let us hope that travelling will not
have sharpened his intelligence," said
JELLIBOND. "When will they be here?"
"I expect them to dinner."
JELLIBOND groaned. "You had better
ask the CADENHOUSES to dine too," he
suggested. "It will give BABS someone
to be rude to besides ourselves."
"How thoughtful you are, JELLIBOND,"
said Mrs. KINGCONSTANCE. "I will write
to them directly after luncheon. Shall
I tell them BABS will be here?"
"Not if you want them to come,"
answered JELLIBOND, grimly.
BABS'S greeting to her family, on her
arrival, was characteristic. Tea was in
the drawing-room when she entered, and
Mrs. KINGCONSTANCE was preparing to
attack her fourth muffin.
"Hallo, mother!" she said. "Still
eating! If you don't take care you "11
die of apoplexy."
"Really, BABS, how can you say such
things 1 " replied her mother, nervously.
"You here too, TINNEY ?" she went on,
turning to JELLIBOND. "Hanging on to the
mater's skirts as usual."
"My dear BABS, is that a way to address
your future father-in-law?" JELLIBOND
asked with heavy geniality.
"Oh, hang fathers-in-law!" said BABS.
"I wish the relationship didn't exist."
"So do I," JELLIBOND answered sweetly.
When the CADENHOUSES arrived she
greeted them in her usual sprightly
manner.
"You 're looking more than usually
plain this evening, Aunt LORRAINE," she
said, as they sat down to dinner. "I
wonder why CADENHOUSE married yon
instead of me."
"That 'a easily answered," replied her
aunt, acidly. "He thought he would
rather be your uncle than your husband."
"Had you there, BABS!" MONTACUTE
observed from his end of the table.
"Shut up, 'Cute," his sister answered.
"One rude person is quite enough in any
family."
"I do hope you 're not going to quarrel,
children," said Mrs. KINGCONSTANCE, anxi-
ously. "It will quite spoil my dinner."
"I don't think that will, matter," an-
swered BABS; "you're too fat as it is,
mater."
CADENHOUSE gasped.
"Is she always like this at home?" he
murmured to his wife.
"Always," replied Lady CADENHOUSE.
"It is her idea of humour."
"What an escape I had!" thought
CADENHOUSK.
"When are you going to be married,
mater?" asked MONTACUTE, presently.
Abruptness was a peculiarity of the KING-
CONSTANCE family.
"As soon as wo can find a house,
dear," said his mother.
"JELLIBOND heard of one in Gloucester-
shire the other day."
"If you imagine I "m going to bury my-
self in Gloucestershire, you 're much mis-
taken," said BABS.
"Of course not," said Mrs. KINGCON-
STANCE, greatly relieved; "you will stay
here with "CUTE."
"Thank you," put in MONTACUTE, drily;
"I would rather you left me out of your
arrangements.''
"But you know you will like to have
your sister with you," said Mrs. KING-
CONSTANCE, persuasively.
"My dear mother, do be serious,"
answered MONTACUTE. "Is it likely that
I should like BABS to live with me?
Would anybody like it? Do you like it
yourself?"
"No," said his mother, " I 'm afraid I
don't."
"No more should I," said MONTACUTE
decisively.
Mrs. KINGCONSTANCE wrung her hands.
"JELLIBOND said this would happen," she
moaned, "and I didn't believe him. Was
ever anything so unfortunate!"
"Cheer up, mater," said BABS, coming
to the rescue, "I shall be all right. I '11
go and stay with CADENHOUSE."
"Pardon me," returned Lady CADEN-
HOUSE, "you will do nothing of the kind.
Nothing would induce me to consent to
such an arrangement."
"You are always so selfish, LORRAINE,"
said Mrs. KINGCONSTANCE, plaintively.
"It's in the family, I suppose."
"When I have the misfortune to have
a niece whose manners are absolutely
insufferable," snapped Lady CADENHOUSE,
"I can scarcely be blamed for not wishing
to have her permanently in my house."
"Cat!" interjected BABS.
"I think, perhaps, I have a suggestion
which might meet the difficulty," said
JELLIBOND gently.
"You are always so clever, JELLIBOND,"
said Mrs. KlNGOONSTANCE.
"A life spent in compounding American
drinks, and in the practise of hypnotism
to induce people to swallow them, tends to
sharpen the faculties," JELLIBOND observed
modestly.
"Go ahead, TINNEY," said BABS.
"My suggestion is," JELLIBOND said
sweetly, "that this young lady should
be given an allowance—a small allowance
—by her mother, and go and 'live her
life.' I think that is the phrase. She
might then indulge in any eccentricities
of deportment which she fancies without
annoying her relatives."
"But she can't possibly live by her-
self," put in Mrs. KINGCONSTANCE. "She
will want a chaperon."
"BABS is so very modern that that
perhaps might be dispensed with," re-
plied JELLIBOXD. "Besides, I doubt
whether you could get any chaperon to
stay. Chaperons are very independent
nowadays. They are almost as bad as
housemaids."
"That is true," said Lady CADENHOUSE.
"If, however, you dislike the idea of
her living alone," JELLIBOND went on,
"she might, perhaps, board with Mrs.
GRAND, or share rooms with the Heavenly
Twins. Or she might live at one of those
advanced clubs, where the food is cheap
and the committee are not too particular.
Ultimately, of course, she would start a
crusade. Disagreeable women always end
by starting crusades. But I daresay you
would not object to that."
"Not at all," said Mrs. KINGCONSTAJJCK.
"It all sounds very suitable. When do
you think she could start, LORRAINE?
Would to-morrow be too soon?"
"Nothing could possibly be too soon,"
replied Lady CADENHOUSE.
And that was the end of BABS the In-
sufferable. ST. J. H.
A WANDERING IN WIERTZLAND.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, — It was WILSON
WAGGLETHORPE who conceived the idea of
wandering to Wiertzland. He had never
set eyes on the paintings of the weird
impressionist, but somewhere or another
he had come across a reputed portrait of
the eccentric Belgian, and thenceforth
his mind became, if I may so put it.
be-Wiertzed. He was certain that WIERTZ
was the grandest limner who had ever
existed in the land of D. TENIERS and
P. P. RUBENS. And I was so persuaded
by WAGGLETHORPE that, lo, and behold!
one fine evening found us crossing the
North Sea on board of the G. E. R.'s
comfortable ship the Colchester.
I cannot say, before we retired to rest,
that WAGGLETHORPB'S conduct was in any
way extraordinary; but the next morning,
when I ascended on to the deck to survey
the very red, green and yellow hues
(representing houses, meadows and water)

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
of' tho Scheldt and country, I was sur-
prised, when my friend drew me on one
side, and whispered, "Look, there is
WIERTZ in the flesh." Ho pointed to a
gentleman who had no peculiarity about
him, in so far as I could see, but the fact
that ho wore a Peagreen Waistcoat. Ho
might have been WIERTZ. but his flesh was
not superabundant, and he was drinking
rum and milk, and not, as might have
been supposed, Wicrtz-key and water.
His appearance, however, greatly im-
pressed WILSON WAGCLETHORPE, who,
relying upon tho authenticity of tho
"WlERTZ likeness (cut out of an American
paper), still asserted that it was tho
painter redivions, Tho portrait, 1 after-
wards discovered, was that of a Texan
filibuster; but let that pass—as he did—
away.
On arrival at Antwerp, WILSON WAGGLE-
THORPE immediately proceeded to provide
himself with the coins of Belgium and
several other Continental states. I may
here state that this monetary collection
comprised (1) a- two-franc piece bearing
the image and superscription of pear-
headed Louis PHILIPPE, (2) a coin with
a female figure supposed to be Helvetia,
(3) a solid piece of silver revealing very
indistinctly the features of the Re Galan-
tuomo VICTOR EMMANCEL, (4) a Greek
token of dubious minting, (5) a WallachiTin
para; and (6) what looked like a Nijui-
Novgorod goods label, together with other
currency, all of which was refused by tho
subjects of King LEOPOLD.
Now, it so happened that when WAGGLE-
THORPE was collecting his cash, there
appeared at the self-same house of call
the Man in the Pea-green Waistcoat,
otherwise WIERTZ restored like an Old
Master. WAGGLETHORPE immediately put
down his income of dubious doubloons to
the malevolent influence of the stranger.
A curious theory, considering his infatua-
tion for WIERTZ'S work, which he had
never seen. And also, curiously enough,
on six separate occasions, when WAGGLE-
THORPE was endeavouring to pass away
the coins, WIERTZ'S double appeared—
once at the Zoo, when WILSON was paying
for some nuts for the monkeys; again, at
the Music Hall just after a spirited artist
had done seven "turns" in unbroken
succession; again, in the vxigon-lit car-
riage, bound for Brussels, when my
friend was attempting to compel the
controletir to givo him whiskey, which he
did not sell; also, when he was stealing
away from a cab; and, lastly, when he
was trying to defraud a bookstall clerk
in respect of a Tauchnitz novel. On
each and every occasion there was tho
Man in the Pea-green Waistcoat, survey-
ing WAGGLETHORPE with an unearthly and
undeniable smile.
On arrival at Brussels we chartered
a driver to take us to the Museo
Wiertz. The charioteer swore that ho

had never heard of the establishment, but
by dint of promises of pourboires he finally,
after taking us to a horticultural show,
a home for sick animals, and the Hotel
do Ville, brought us to the desired edi-
fice. WAGGLETHORPE immediately glued
his eyes to the little holes through which
the visitor gazes at the Wiertzian spec-
tres. He chuckled with delight, and was
also much taken with a delineation of
NAPOLEON I., in a warmer placo than tho
Tuilcries was supposed to bo before it
was burned by the Communists. Then
he turned round and selected several
catalogues and photographs, and I saw
him hand the Louis PHILIPPE coin to the
attendant. The latter raised his head ;md
said, in unmistakable and coarse English,
"Look 'ere, governor, 'adn't you better
drop it?" It was the Man in tho Pea-
green Waistcoat!
WAGGLETHORPE gave a fearful yell, and
i flinging down the whole of his base metals,
fled from the Museum.
I met him subsequently at the Gare du
\ord, wrestling with much absinthe. "By
Jove!" he exclaimed, "I was right.
That man was WIERTZ, after all."

the traffic, not one-tenth part of which has been able to pass.
The enemy's earthworks, fosses and artificially-made barricades
of scaffold poles have been so well held by strong bodies
(especially strong when the weather has been at all warm) that
the citizens have almost despaired of ever " getting through."
But under cover of the darkness last night, General Omnibus's
contingent, ill the absence of most part of the enemy on public
(house) duty succeeded in forcing the passage.
This morning, terms of peace have teen arranged. On con-
dition that the citizens do not press their advantage, the Trades
Unions controlling the working army have agreed that at the
end of flve years, when the indentures of the apprentices
(whom they are now instructing in landscape gardening in the
London streets) shall have run out, they will once more allow
the general body of Londoners to use their own roads. These
terms were accepted without demur, as being much more
favourable than any which the hapless citizens had ever
expected.

MY love, I cannot make you any verses,
1 've used up every single rhyme 1 know.
My still-born stanzas merely end in curses,
Prosaic wrath your former poet nurses.
And more, my dear, what infinitely worse is,
BROWN makes his go.
BROWN, who could never shine among the shiners,
BROWN, who was envious of the praise I got,
Least useful of the wretched penny-a-liners,
One of the legion of perpetual winners.
Sits high amongst the most luxurious diners,
And 1 do not.
My love, the songs I made to give you pleasure
Brought me my name and ruined me completely,
For I have spent the last of all my treasure,
Squandered for you Love's last mellifluous measure,
Sung all my voice away through work and leisure—
Sung far too sweetly;
But though 1 starve, now 1 can sing no more,
1 keep the love that made me sing before.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAUT OF TOHY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 17.—
No use shirking fact that REDMOND
Cadet's comrades look upon him •with
newly-born suspicion. Constitutionally
quick-witted, familiar by pained experi-
ence, from the days of SADLIER downwards,
with the tendency of patriots to make
personally advantageous terms with the
Saxon, they don't like the Cadet's goings-
on to-night. They may do him injustice;
certainly the circumstance is peculiar.
Except that his legs are more substantial,
his voice more resonant, he in relation to
public life recalls Mr. Sim Tappertit,
captain of the 'Prentice Knights, later,
when times grew stirring, known as The
United Bulldogs. He has the ponderous
gravity, the occasional aloofness, the fatal
fluency, and, above all, the boundless
ambition of the politician who disturbed
the reign of GEORGE THE SECOND.
It must also be said that to one of his
temperament and ability the situation is
tempting. It is true C.-B. is nominally
leader of the Liberal Party, and the other
night the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD amicably
dined in his company. But the Liberal
Party is at least a Trinity of organism.
To-night one section of it has come to the
fore. Taking no counsel with Front
Bench, LLOYD-GEORGE moved adjournment
in order to hold up to contempt and
detestation of delighted foreigners his
countrymen, who at the close of more
than eighteen months' hard fighting and
incessant toil are doing their best for the
women and children abandoned by the
Boers. Amid rapturous cheers from " the
foreign element "in the House, boasted
of by REDMOND Aine, LLOYD - GEORGE
denounced Englishmen in charge of the
refugee camps as guilty of deliberate
ill-treatment of women and children, a
parallel for which ho found only in the
dealing of Spain with Cuba.
JOHN ELLIS, not to be outdone, likened
state of things under British flag to the
Black Hole of Calcutta. BRYN ROBERTS,
happily inarticulate, bobbed up and down
on the Bench and shook his gory hat at the
Secretary of State for War. That man of
Peace, Captain Putin, gnashed his teeth
over Mr.- HALDANE, whose judicial habit
led him to invite production of proof of
the infamies charged against absent men.
REDMOND Cadet saw his opportunity, and
seized it by the hair. Here were sheep—or,
in recognition of their belligerent attitude,
rams—without a shepherd. Now was the
time to strike in, and show them where one
was to be found. He could rant with the
loudest of them. To denounce anything
British, to bring gross charges against
anyone bearing the commission of the
Sovereign, or endowed with the authority
of the Executive, had been his pastime
from boyhood. If Englishmen and Welsh-
men were fouling the national nest, should
an Irish Member refrain from applauding
them? REDMOND Cadet thought not.
Moreover, there was the ulterior motive
suspected by PATRICK O'BRIEN, sniffed at by
Mr. FLAVIN. Last Session REDMOND Cadet
was one night discovered on the Front
Opposition Bench. The incident was re-
garded at the time as a mere ebullition of
the high spirits which sometimes tempt
the street gamin to walk behind an uncon-
scious swell mimicking his manner. To-
night there is uneasy suspicion in the
Irish camp that it had deeper meaning.
and gazing reflectively round the House,
he asked another. '' What is small coal ?''
JOICEY, sitting opposite, thrust his
hand in his trousers' pocket and drew it
forth with look of keen disappointment
on a face prematurely seamed with the
Shilling Coal Tax. "The Right Hon.
Gentleman," he said, "should give notice
of that Question." If he had only known,
he would have brought down a handful
of small coal, which, chucked at the head
| of the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,
might have carried conviction. As it was,
! ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS, ignoring in-

A STUDY IN LATTERDAY "LIBERALISM."
Warm and tolerant reception of a good Liberal who ventured to hazard the assertion that in all
probability our fellow-countrymen in South Africa were not engaged in carrying through a wanton and
criminal war with the grossest barbarity to women and children. These outrageously "Jingo"
sentiments were naturally received with every symptom of horror and detestation on the Radical benches.
(Mr. H-ld-ne, K.C.)
Why should REDMOND Cadet play second terruption, repeated the enquiry, " What
fiddle among Irishmen below the Gangway is small coal V"
when he might lead at least a section of Echo answered, "What?" And there
the historic Liberal Party? Listening to ,was no other response. Even the SQUIRE
tirades delivered below and above the! OF MALWOOD who, since he migrated to
Gangway on Opposition side, there seems ; Monmouthshire, has become personally
distinct appropriateness in the bold; acquainted with the Coal Industry, had
scheme born to-night in a busy brain. no readier or fuller reply. Difficulty
Bumnesa done.—Factories' Bill read a
second time, at the fag end of a sitting
whose freshest hours were snatched for
surprise attack on the caretakers of the
Boer refugees.
Tuesday night.—" Wrhat is a' pound?"
asked a great financial authority long since
gathered to his fathers. The ingathering
took place before the problem was solved.
SARK says, in the Bankruptcy Court of
to-day, a pound varies. Sometimes it's
one and threepence ; occasionally it runs
up to fifteen shillings. The remark
seems inconsequential. It was Sir ROBERT
PEEL'S classic question the CHANCELLOR
OP THE EXCHEQUER had in his mind
when, leaning his elbow on the box
arose on rumour that, his heart softening
towards the ruined millionaires of thocoal
mines, the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER
had been tempted to reduce by one-half
the export duty on small coal. ST.
MICHAEL now explained he was quite
ready to take that step. But whilst
meditating on it ho found himself faced
by the problem he had stated.
Others of analogous form have proved
not impregnable.
"What is Truth?'
School teacher of
asked the Sunday
attentive class.
"Please, Sir, it's sixpence," answered
a small boy whose father was in the
bookstall business.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OF THE EXCHEQUER asked for the third
time, and over the silent House there
broke no murmur of response.
Business done.—Civil List Bill read a
third time.
House of Lords, Thursday night.—The
MARKISS has infinite scorn for his fellow
men. It is intensified in contemplation of
the assembly in which, nearly sixty years
ago, Lord ROBERT CECIL won his spurs.
Would rather not allude to its existence.
If it be forced on his unwilling attention
waives it off with contemptuous gesture.
When, as to-night, Honse of Commons is
bracketed with what the MARKISS calls
"the Drunkards' Bill" (it is really the
BISHOP OF WINCHESTER'S) his contempt
becomes vitriolic. Bill coming up for
third reading, SPENCER wanted to know
what course Government would take in the
Commons. Would it be carried through
this session?
"That depends." snapped the MARKISS,
"upon the action of persons with whom
the noble EARL has closer political con-
nection than I can claim."
All he could say was that the Measure
would appear with a Ministerialist
asterisk affixed. A sign, he believed,
which "meant so much in another place."
Poor, pallid print can convey no idea of
the scorn conveyed in this reference to
the House of Commons' custom whereby
-Ministerial Bills are distinguished on the
Orders of the Day by an asterisk. "Star-
ring a Bill," it is called in that poor,
maudlin assembly. Contemplation of
the process increased the MARKISS'S
amusement at the childishness of the
House of Commons. Pressed to say
whether the Licensing Bill would be
similarly distinguished on its Agenda, he
Iweame almost funny.
"lam not," ho said, "invested with
the power of distributing these much
envied stars. If the noble lord will give
me a day's notice, 1 will tell him some-
thing about that form of astronomy."
Noble Lords loyally, not too loudly,
laughed. They knew by hearsay of the
existence of the House of Commons. They
even have heard some talk of a pretension
or desire on its part to abolish the House
of Lords! It was scarcely worth noticing;
but well enough to have it occasionally
snubbed in this exquisitely humorous
fashion.
"When I hear the MARKISS referring to
the House of Commons," said the LORD
HIGH CHANCELLOR, "it subtly conveys to
my mind the impression that he is holding
it out with a pair of tongs whilst he talks
over its head."
r.nxiiii--:. done.—Budget Bill further dis-
cussed in the Commons.
Friday night.—Committee of House of
Lords have taken in hand subject of the
Declaration made by Sovereign on his
Accession that justly and deeply affronts
our Catholic fellow citizens. ATTORNEY-
GENERAL FOR IRELAND tells me he has
received from an Orange Lodge in Bel-
fast copy of a resolution just passed. It
approves and applauds the barbaric
phrase on the ground that it is "o great
bulivark of civil and religions liberty."
When wo come to think of it, recalling
the objectionable phrase and all it implies
to the detriment of some millions of
fellow-citizens, this is the grimmest piece
of unconscious humour I recall.
Mr. GLADSTONE once told the MEMBER
FOR SARK he well remembered in his
early days, on taking his seat in the House
of Commons reciting and subscribing an
Oath of Allegiance equally offensive to
Catholic citizens.
"On one occasion," Mr. G. said,
"following on a general election, I sang
the words very small so as not to
offend the just susceptibilities of DANIEL
O'CONNELL, who stood close by me taking
the Oath in the form then specially pre-
scribed for Catholics."
Business done.—Scotch Votes in Com-
mittee.

A SONG OF SCIENCE.
[The United States Fisheries Commission are
making efforts to evolve same hybrid fish of an
entirely new type by mixing the eggs at spawning
time. . . . Another marvel which will possibly
be produced is the turtle with, an edible shell, by
crossing the soft-shell crab with a terrapin."—
Daily Paper.]
O LIST while I sing
You the following song,
Quite a short little thing
That will not keep you long,
In praise of American science,
Which appears to be going it strong.
We know that our kin
Work wonders not small;
A yarn they can spin
Out of nothing at all,
And on the most slender foundation's
Build stories amazingly tall.
For turtle, as such,
No longer they wish,
They are seeking a much
More luxurious dish,
So, instead of just crossing the ftsh-pond,
They 've taken to crossing the fish.
To soften the shell
Is their object and care,
And they 've managed quite well,
As you 're doubtless aware,
In doing the trick with their nut trees—
At least, they 're all colonels out there;
And before this same year
Has worn itself out,
We shall all of us hear
Of fresh wonders, no doubt,
That they 've crossed a cucumber with
salmon,
And Whitstable oysters with stout.
ERIN GO BRAGH.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I perceive that there
is a movement on foot, initiated by the
Patriot DOOGAN, M.P., for teaching the
Irish language to the youthful REDMONDS
and HEALEYS of the Emerald Isle. I am
sorry that the Government has not
acquiesced in the motion. I, myself,
would bring in a measure compelling all
Hibernian Members of Parliament to de-
nounce (they never speak) in their native
tongue. Just fancy the rapture with which
they would inveigh in a language incap-
able of comprehension by a single Sassen-
ach! And what a mighty relief to the
other legislators! If necessary, the
Speaker might be provided with an Anglo-
Irish Dictionary, or possibly a new post
(open to Nationalists only) might bo
created, viz., Interpreter for Ireland.
Trusting that my suggestion may be
supported by you.
I am, yours obediently,
LINDLEY MURRAY WALKER.
The College, Torkington-on-the-Marsh.
