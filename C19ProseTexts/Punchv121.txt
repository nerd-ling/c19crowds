CJEliTAINLY it was a passing poor object that met the eye of the Arch-Practitioner as he entered the apartment
I of John Buu,, patient. A Specialist in complications, he was accustomed to prescribe for the most distressing
symptoms with a smiling face. To-day, however, he wore an air of unusual seriousness. A faint savour of quackery,
which pervaded the room, had not escaped the professional nostril, emunct as ever; but had confirmed his suspicion that
he should have been called in at an earlier stage. In consequence, he was inclined to adopt a tone of moral exhortation
rare in so genial a Physician as Dr. Punch.
"Let us plunge at once," he said, "in infimas rex: that is to say, begin at the lower end. Our foot, now.
A touch, shall we confess, of podagra vulgaris, induced by feeding and drinking with a somewhat expensive
abandonment 1 Physically, I find this development to be without interest; but psychologically a thing to note. Has
it not struck you as strange that people who are forever whining of bad times, the strain of the war, the pressure of
taxation, the decline of trade, the influx of competitive aliens, the necessity of cutting down luxuries, such, notably,
as the purchase of books and' pictures, or the assistance of charities (matters, these, that concern the head and heart),
should have attempted no sort of economy in the affairs of the stomach, but rather have developed a taste for animal
luxury unprecedented within the memory of man 1 Prankly, I cannot commiserate with you who now pay the penalty
of this offence; nor will I prescribe for you any sedative drug. Until you can appreciate the value of 'Plain living
and high thinking' for its own sake, I wish you a very excruciating gout and many of them.
"Our arm, to move upwards, is a different thing; another pair of sleeves, as the saying is. Yet here you have
yourself to blame for postponing precautions to the last moment. Morally, it is the way of you; you wander casually
on when there is no danger, and only employ these necessary measures under stress of immediate peril, and under
conditions most inconvenient to everybody except the enemy. Your single merit, in this connection, is that you are
not of those pitiful creatures, the conscientious objectors.
"But what shall we say of this affection of our head 1 Swollen, originally, by over-confidence, it is now suffering, by
reaction, from the other extreme of depression. Time was, when you had blood enough and brains enough to leave your
rivals standing. Then, like the hare in the story, you seized the occasion to fall asleep, out of mere assurance; and now

you turn lazily, half-awake, to find yourself a lap or so behind in the race. You roll over, muttering curses on fortune,
on fate, on anything but your own sole stupidity. You must wake up altogether, my good friend, as your new Prince
said the other day; and not lie on your laurels till they lose their shape past all recognition.
"And this reminds me that a certain Canon has been writing an article about you, Mr. Buj.i., alleging that you are
a played-out type, which always stood for a hatred of ideas; and hinting that limbo was the only place for your like.
He was wrong, this reverend gentleman; you never hated ideas; but lately you have grown too easily contented with
the wrong kind; and you have left it to others to invent them for you. And what inventors! Look at all this stuff
I see strewn about you. Heaven, of course, forbid that I should abuse the Brass at its best, but you may have too much
of even a good thing; you may easily get such a surfeit of other people's ideas as to cease, through sheer distension,
from thinking for yourself.
"As for this gutter-press of the Continent, I don't doubt but you still find yourself very superior to your neighbours
who feed on this sort of garbage. Yet they only take what's given them; and how much more do you do yourself in
the way of discrimination 1 Indeed, I think they have the laugh of you when they can point to something not so very
different being hawked about beneath your very nose. No other country but yours would tolerate it. But you, with
your damnable indifference, suffer yourself to1 be imposed upon by the old plea for liberty of opinion. Liberty of
fiddlesticks, Sir! I'd have the whole bag of treasonable tricks burned by the common hangman.
"But sufficient for one homily. And, after all, you 're sound enough at heart; it's only your brain that wants
stimulating from its atrophy. That's a work that asks no drugs if you will but remember ray moral prescription of
plainer living and higher thinking.
"So, to our next more jovial meeting in the New Year! Meanwhile I present you with the most perfect cure for
a disordered system. It will, at least, help you to set your face on the right road of 'efficiency' tempered by
genial mirth. Forgive my air of Mchoolmaster, and permit me to make my peace by begging your acceptance of my

THE BOOK OP BEAUTY.
A Great Thought for Every Day in the Year.
Second Series.
VI.—THE HENLEY SECTION.
(Continued from June.)
These City Imperial Voluntaries, rhymeless and rhymed, are
dedicated, as before, with the author's sincere admiration, to the
Poet (not the Regatta).
June 17th, 18th.—Night and the starless Void,
And cloud-rack canopies that veil
The undiscoverable vault of heaven;
And, over the City's coruscating gloom,
High in his beetling four-square tower,
Big Ben, the bull's-eyed Constable,
Plashing his sentinel beam for sign
How, underneath, the nation's tireless brain
Seethes at its sacerdotal task of framing laws.
19TH.—With swirl of oozy ebb the River goes
Bedridden, bargee-blasphemous,
Lipping the terraced stones
Outworn with commerce of tea and cakes
And jaunty legislators' junketings.
20th.—Within, the uncommunicative mace
(Symbol of that portentous sovereignty
Which stamps the people's choice,
Arch-progeny of the proletariate Will)
Watches the tragic comedy
Play out its tardy length to stertorous stalls.
21st.—Hark where in windy platitudes,
Compound of the froth of undigested fact
And ponderous tub-thump wit of the hustings-wag,
Each for his own advertisement,
They rant—they bellow—they abuse.
22nd.—Here sits the Chief, disturbed
From healthy spasms of philosophic doubt,
Politely querulous of his truant ranks
Once counted adequate
To play the not-too-exigent part
Of gentlemanly walkers-on—
Now damned for irredeemable diners-out.
23rd, 24th.— There lies the Opposition's fold
Incurably divided from itself—
These, ralliant to their country, right or wrong,
Those, cheek by jowl against her, wVong or right;
And, in the desperate interval, behold
The dubious Campbell-wether of the flock
Protagonising in his own despite,
And butted fore and aft
Whither not he nor they precisely know.
25lH.—This is our Ancient Mother of Parliaments,
Fallen on dotage-days
Varied by episodic savagery,
But, for the rest,
Abysmal, desolate, irreclaimably dull.
What have we done to you,
Mother, O Mother,
That you requite us with so quaint a farce,
Such disillusioning parody of your Prime?
26th, 27th.—Inveterate airs that blow
As from a dim orchestral Age of Brass ;—
A rout of coryphees that toil and spin
With lustre of whirling lace and giddy gyre
Of hose rough-hued to ape
The arduous leg within ;—
Sallies of immemorial patriot wit,
Potent to kill, but impotent to pass ;—
And lo!
London's immeasurable mouth agape
From gallery to tranced pit
With worship ; her Imperial eyes aglow
With the divine ecstatic lire!
28th TO 30th.—There is no male here, this ambrosial night,
But feels the manhood vocal in his veins.
There is no woman, if I read them right,
But in her hidden heart
Envies yon breezy sylph the art
By which she turns these virile brains
To irreducible pulp, and sets the breast
Apant behind its hedge of shining shirt.
What unconjecturable spell
Inspires this exquisite torture of unrest,
Or where the point of what the humorous mime
Says, and the sudden midriff splits—
Not I, who rarely enter here, can tell.
They, rather, who from unremembered time
Follow the same old Grace's flying skirt,
The same old amorous play of pencilled eyes,
And the unwearied acrobacy of wits
Reiterate past fear of rude surprise—
These, lifting voluntaries clear and strong,
May quire aloud what happy quest is theirs
Who tread the nightly stairs
Of London's luminous Halls of Mirth and Song.
O. S.
LAMENTS OF LONDON.
[" The Government hare abandoned their Education Bill. The fate of the
Cockerton schools is still undecided."—Daily Paper.}
Mother City speaks:
Dark are the dens in my teeming life-centres
Where Poverty makes her unspeakable lair,
Where breeze never blows and no sun ever enters—
But darker than all is the ignorance there.
Lust, greed—all the crimes that are damned by the preachers,
Mid fllth of the body and filth of the mind—
These, these are my little ones' eloquent teachers,
And this is the school where my sons are confined.
Ah, think of the foulness that strangles and smothers
Any seed of the good that may struggle to bloom!
Think, Parliament, think of your poor stricken brothers
Sunk deep in these caverns of squalor and gloom!
From these perilous haunts let my sons be protected,
From these nests of black gaol-birds, oh, save them in
time 1
How can they know virtue when left so neglected?
How can they be honest, untaught save in crime?
Come, open your purse I Let the least in the nation
Be trained in the use of his hand and his eye!
Fling open your schools, for in them lies salvation,
By them is the country to live or to die!
Then still shall I see my poor children enjoying
The rights that brave hearts and true citizens rear—
You spend in one brief little week of destroying
As much as I ask for my schools in a year.

principal part of Der Rotter will be played by Oom sweet Oom

Bulkley. "Yes; hek parents psrsuadid her, and it's all ofer between vs."
"■ Sympathetic Friend. "She can't have realised what a lot she was giving up."
UEBS IN EUEE.
"What the doctor says Tommy wants
is nourishment," Mrs. BOFFIN declared
emphatically. "He wants good whole-
some country food."
"Very well, my dear," her husband
had replied listlessly. "Bat I don't be-
lieve you will be able to get him any better
food in the country than you can in Bays-
water. In the Grove"
"Nonsense, John," said Mrs. Boffin.
"You know what Dr. Harvey said.
London food is all adulterated. It is
kept in refrigerators and treated with
chemical preservatives till it has lost all
nutritive qualities. "What Tommy needs
is fresh country milk and butter, fresh
eggs, fresh meat and poultry."
"Yery well, dear," her husband replied
again. "Have it your own way."
So Mrs. Boffin went forth and took
lodgings in a Surrey village, three miles
from a railway station, where the scenery
was delightfully rural, and where Tommy's
health might be quickly re-established by
wholesome English food. The morning
after their arrival Mrs. Boffin's troubles
over poor Tommy's diet began. ".Hasn't
the milkman brought any cream\ this
morning, Mrs. Smith? " she asked.
"I'm afraid you won't get any cream
hereabouts, mem," said that lady much
as if her visitor had asked for the
moon.
"No cream, Mrs. Smith?"
"No, mem; not unless you was to get
it in the village. Mrs. Knapp down at
the shop has some sometimes. She gets
it in jars from London."
"But I want fresh cream," Mrs. BOFFIN
urged; "that will not be fresh."
"It won't be fresh, mem, certainly,"
Mrs. Smith agreed, evidently thinking
that an irrelevant consideration.
Mrs. Boffin knitted her brows. The
problem of Tommy's morning cream seemed
likely to be more difficult than she antici-
pated.
"Very well, Mrs. Smith," she said,
after a moment's thought; "you must
take plenty of fresh milk every night, and
we will get the cream from that."
"It is very difficult to get fresh milk
here, mem," replied Mrs. Smith. "It all
goes to London. There's Swiss milk, of
course," she added, cheerfully.
"Oh, but that won't do at all," said
poor Mrs. Boffin. "I must enquire about
another milkman at once. By the way,
Mrs. Smith, don't forget to have plenty
of fresh eggs in the house. They must be
new-laid."
"You can't get noo-laid eggs here,
mem," Mrs. Smith replied, rather tartly,
stung, perhaps, by the unreasonable char-
acter of the request. "There's French
eggs, of course," she added, meditatively.
"You could get them at the shop."
"But have you no fowls here? Can't I
get any eggs at all?" Mrs. Boffin en-
quired, anxiously.
"There's Russian fowls, mem," said
Mrs. Smith. "Mrs. Knapp has them
twice a week from Leadenhall Market;
you can get them at the shop same as the
eggs."
"But I don't want Russian fowls,"
Mrs. Boffin answered querulously. "I
want Surrey fowls. I thought Surrey was
famous for poultry."
"Oh, yes, mem," said Mrs. SMITH. "We
have .beautiful fowls. But they all goes
up to London, same as the eggs and the
milk and the cream and the butter."
"The butter, Mrs. Smith!" cried Mrs.
Boffin in horror. "Have you no fresh
butter either?"
"It's quite fresh, mem," Mrs. Smith
replied in an injured tone. "Very good
butter it is—Danish."
"But I don't understand this," Mrs.
Boffin moaned. "Your eggs, you say,
come from France, your butter from
Denmark, your cream from London, your
fowls from Russia, your milk from Switzer-
land. Is there no fresh food of any kind
that I can procure here? Where do you
get your meat from?"
"Oh, that comes from New Zealand,
mem," Mrs. SMITH answered, simpering.
"But you have sheep and cows in
Surrey, haven't you?" Mrs. Boffin said
crossly. "Why have you neither milk
nor mutton ?''
"They're all wanted for the London
market, mem," repliod Mrs. Smith.

6 PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[July 3-, 1901.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Handbook of the Administrations of Great Britain (Smith,
Elder) is an cpitomo of the History of Great Britain during
the nineteenth century. Compressed within the space of 350
pages, it is none the less complete. Mr. CELLING Carr-Gomm's
method is simple, when you como to think of it; its working-
out easy, if you are prepared to devote far-reaching research to
the production of what in measurement and avoirdupois weight
comes to very little. Each brief chapter contains a list of the
Cabinets of successive Administrations, from Mr. Addington'S
in the spring of 1801 to Lord Salisbury's Third in the summer
of 1895. A summary of the principal events happening under
successive Administrations is givcn._ My Baronite recognises
in the handy volume a masterpiece of lucid summary. Its
value is increased by a full index.
Mr. Arthur Rickett's Mimes and Rhymes (Brimley Johnson)
is a bright and pleasant little book of jeux d'esprit and parodies
in prose and verse. Mr. Rickett has a happy knack of ridicule.
The flavour is pungent but never acid.
The reader of Deborah of Tod's expects much when he comes
across a new novel by Mrs. Henry de la Pasture. He will not
be disappointed on taking up Catherine of Calais (SMITH, ELDER).
The title is not particularly attractive or in adequate degree
descriptive. My Baronite confesses that, guided by it solely,
apprehending another of the increasingly tiresome pseudo-
historical works now happily in waning fashion, he would have
passed it over. Catherine chanced to pass her childhood in
Calais, the thrall of a cruel aunt, and as Deborah, being "of
Tod's," was a great success, so Catherine is "of Calais." The
longer and fuller portion of her life is lived in London and in
the Devonshire Mrs. De la Pasture knows so well. The story
is strikingly original because of avoidance of what seemed an
obvious turn. When pretty Catherine gives her passionate
heart, her sparkling life into the keeping of a handsome, impas-
sive man, old enough to be her father, the inured novel-reader
naturally expects that by-and-bye a younger knight will come
along, will love and will ride away with the fair and guilty
wife. There is a passage in an early chapter which
indicates this ordinary conclusion of the matter. Possibly it
was contemplated, or perhaps the hint was only artful, designed
to lead astray. However it be, Mrs. De la Pasture has
chosen the better way, keeping Catherine pure and faithful to
the last. The characters, many and various, are drawn with
unerring skill. Lady Sarah Adelstane is etched with a light,
firm, glowing touch that recalls the master-hand of Thackeray,
The ninth volume of the Analo-Saxon Review, published by
Mrs. George Cornwallis-West, of 49, Rupert Street, and
edited by Lady Randolph Spencer Churchill, is, as was said
of the song in Twelfth Night, "more excellent" than the others,
that is, than the preceding volumes—not as to the contents, but
as to the binding, on which subject there is an interesting and
learned article by an expert. The frontispiece is an admirable
likeness of our Gracious Queen Alexandra, and the reproduction
of the three portraits of Cardinal Richelieu is excellent.
Mr. Andrew Lang has an interesting article on Smoixett,
who, he thinks—and rightly—has long ceased to be a popular
author, which information is on a par with the news suddenly
brought us of the decease of Her Majesty Queen Anne. Mr.
Lang misquotes a classic when he writes the line—
Artaxom. Alas, my Bom- {diet)
Bombastet.—'Bastes he would have Baid.
But this he can put right by a more careful study of that
immortal work. Where the Baron once detects a misquote ho
begins to bo cautious. The similarity between Barry Lyndon
and " Ferdinand Count Fathom " is, to the Baron's thinking, not
sufficiently brought out and insisted on, and of the parallelism
between Dickens and Smollett he would willingly have heard
more. Edwin Sharpe Grew's article on the Physiognomy of
newspapers would be imperfect did it not deal with Mr.
Punch's own remarkable and unique physiognomy. He should
have given Mr. Milliken's reply, as narrated in Mr. Spiel-
MANN's invaluable history of Punch, to the lady who complained
that " Punch is not so good as it used to be." "No," replied
Milliken, " it never was." Mr. Grew alludes by implication
to this most happy mot. The Baron congratulates Mrs. CORN-
wallis-West and Lady Randolph (a dual personality) on this
pleasant volume, of which it can be honestly said, judging alone
from the outside, that " it is bound to please." Baron de B.-W.
OCCASIONAL OPERATIC NOTES.
La Tosca. Better have left La Tosca, with SARA Bernhardt
for the heroine, as a melodrama, than have chosen it for a
musical setting, even when the music is Puccini's. But that
throughout it is most dramatic is what "nobody can deny."
How fortunate to find as interpreters a Fraulein Ternina for
Floria Tosca, and a De Marchi for Mario Cavaradossi—(what
memories does not the name of Mario recall in Opera !),—with
Signor Scotti for Baron Scarpia, all so vocally, musically and
dramatically excellent. Without such artistes as these, what
would l)ocoine of the Opera, qua Opera? 'Tis good, but not
great. Where are such rare merits in it as will make it live?
Puccini's La Tosca is for all sorts of "time," but not for an
age. By the way, how true a motto for any Opera is "Tempora
mutantur"!
The comic Sacristan is capitally played by M. Gilubert, the
character recalling some trait of Calchas in La Belle Hilene.
The entire Opera excellently rendered with Policeman Man-
cinelli on his beat in the orchestra.
Tuesday.—In three acts, all "made in Germany," Tristan
und Isolde. A fine performance. Ternina magnificent in acting
and singing. Everybody enthusiastic. Marie Brema admir-
able as usual, and Baritone Bispham—(Quite a title this! Almost
as good as " Baronet Bispham," or " Bispham, Bart." !)—not a
whit behind the best of 'em, pick 'em where you like. The tenor,
with the regular knock-me-down name of Forchhammer,
if not startling, was at all events pleasing, as being never
untuneful. The chorus, an "unconsidered trifle" where
WAGNER has his sing and say, satisfactory. Orchestra, under
Lohse, quite up to the mark—"the Konig Marke"—and
scenery as good as they can make it, though what the great
improvements in stage machinery may have been, of which so
much was heard and now so little has been seen, it is difficult
to arrive at. House full and " smart."
Thursday.—Great disappointment for some of us, who had
been eagerly looking forward to the Huguenots with Suzanne
Adams, Lucienne Breval, Signor do Marchi, and Fraulein
Frisky Scheff—(No, beg pardon !—how the mis-scheff could the
mistake have arisen?—on vent dire "Fritzi Scheff ")—as Vrbain,
the Page of Huguenot musical history. But who shall foresee
the events of a rehearsal? Who shall protect the delicate
throat? Notices are wired far and near, "Opera changed to
Faust. Brisval indisposed." Alas I poor Breval! May she
speedily recover her voice, and may this deponent be there to
hear her sing the "Tu m'ami," with the best tenor able to
thrill the house, tear himself from his Valentine, and jump like
a springheel'd lover into the street below.
Faust, always old, always to be revived, and ever available
for rejuvenising. M. Salignac as the " Old Master Restored"
(a good and artistic sub-title for the opera herewith presented
gratis to the Syndicate C. G.) is not all one could wish; still,
for his performance "tol lol" is an adequate musical and vocal
formula. Journet as Mephisto, pro hac vice "for this journey,"
sufficeth; but "caparisons are odorous," so no more at
present, except to exclaim with the nautical William, "What!
Susan, ahoy!" and to add that those who have not seen Miss
Suzanne Adams when she sings and plays Marguerite have yet
something to live for. "Qui vivra, verra." And so into July,
and theGrand Finale within measurable distance.

VOILA CE QUE L'ON DIT DE MOI!"
de Hollande I"—Song of (Prince) Paul in Offenbach's "La Grande Dachesse.")

When the war lirst began, the Boers quite
believed
That Kruger might capture the Queen;
For the fibs that he told
To the peoplo he "sold,"
"Were odd and uncommonly mean!
But later, when matters began to look
black,
The President thought he would hide;
So he mounted his "gee"
(Like Gilpin was lie),
And straightway went off for a ride.
When they found from that ride that he
did not return,
They searched, but the search was in
vain,
For Paul in this plight
Had now taken flight,
And was lodged, for a while, in a train.
But the foe drew too close to our Oom
Paul's abode,
So lest he a captive should be,
He said, " Inform Steyn
That I now fully mean
To take a long voyage by sea."
Mrs. Kruger, who wrote when he reached
the sea-port,
Begged PAUL'that ho'd take her with him.
But he wired, " My dear,
I can't have you here;
jVo time to indulge this new whim."
From the ship Oelderland, which the Queen
of the Dutch
Lent our valiant, fugitive hero,
He landed in France
Where he hoped to advance
His cause, which just then stood at zero.
Though banquets they gave to Oom Paul
and his suite
(Such stuffing was fit quite to kill 'em),
He saw with some pain
He must "move on" again
And said, "1 '11 seek Emperor VlLLEM."
But Villem had bus'ness that took him
away,
So couldn't dear Oom Paul receive,
Who then in dismay
Set sail the next day
For Holland his cause to retrieve.
There, too, he did not get "material aid,"
But met with a " hearty ovation ";
With music and showers
Of beautiful flowers
Evincing the joy of the nation.
They paraded with banners before his
hotel,—
Paul Eruger no rest could obtain;
For they sang till past one,
And then hadn't done,
But chorus'd again and again.
At length some transparencies, brightly
lit up,
His men to the crowd did display:
The words made 'em weep,
"Hush ! KRUGER must sleep!"
So, tearfully, all crept away.
And now all his friends who are making a
fuss,
A vigilant eyeion'him keep,
And they ask, speaking low
As they walk on tip-toe,
"Is our wide-awake Oom still asleep?"
BRITISH BRUTALITY.
With regard to the outcry recently
raised by Miss Hobhousk and others
anent the conditions of the Boer Refuge
Camps forwomen and children, Mr. Punch's
Lady Commissioner, having made exhaust-
ive enquiries, now reports as follows :—
I can fully believe in any enormities
alleged, or to be alleged, against the
British, as I found a most shocking state
of things existing.
1. The supply of Hairpins is wholly in-
adequate.
2. The whole camp of 573 women had
but one back number of a Ladies' paper
amongst them, with a fashion-plate depict-
ing a positively odious costume of last
season.
3. Only five bottles of "Violettes de
Parme scent were to be found throughout.
4. No spirit-lamps for the proper heat-
ing of curling-tongs—this is a fact.
5. Owing to their military duties, none
of the British officers ever come in to
afternoon tea with, or do anything to
socially entertain, the Boer ladies. This
is looked upon as particularly brutal con-
duct, and makes one quite inclined to
believe in almost any charge of neglect.
C. It will hardly be credited when I
say that not a single set of Ping-Pong is
to be found throughout the whole of the
Refuge Camp I
7. Ladies' maids are almost impossible
to obtain. All the Boer women have to
do their own hair.
8. A salmon mayonnaise is simply an
unknown luxury. The Boer ladies ask for
ices to be supplied regularly to the
Refuge, but the authorities refuge—beg
pardon—refuse, I should say, their re-
quest.
9. There is no Ladies' Golf Club.
In conclusion, I venture to make a small
suggestion. It is that those Boer ladies
peopling the Refuge Camps should be
brought over to England and given a
season in town at the expenso of the
country. This would silence every com-
plaint, and make things pleasant all
round.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[Jult 3, 1901.
A "GO" AT THE GAIETY.
j£i Lessee and Manager George EDwardes is a lucky
^\9SSpS§S^^ man: his horse wins, his theatre -wins. It takes
\^S&>? a trainer and a jockey to do the victorious horse
UsTrSQ trick, but it takes two authors, two lyricists, and
"^*£?}S6$L^. two composers, with designers and makers of
&S-0>~^- costumes, of dresses, of uniforms, of hats, of
wigs, "properties," floral decorations, and gloves, all men-
tioned in the playbill (and what a seridus matter the pay-bill
must be!) to achieve success for " Mr. George Edwardes' New
Production," The Toreador, at the Gaiety Theatre.
Certainly, the horse's gallop at racing pace is over in a
few minutes ; a mere breathing space, and we knew the worst
or best, but it may take weeks to decide the fate of a piece,
whether it shall run for months or "come off " after a spirited
struggle for life.
Gaiety pieces, or rather musical plays—(they are scarcely
"plays," and "extravaganzas" may be the more fitting des-
cription),—brought out wherever they may be, at Daly's, or the
Lyric, or anywhere else, as long as they arc produced by Mr.
George Edwardes, on the Edwardes' method and plan, may or
may not at first make a "palpable hit," but after a while, by
the strictest attention to business on the part of all concerned
in the production, whatever doesn't "go" goes out, and in
its place something that makes a hit is substituted, until the
patchwork of necessarily eccentric design, perhaps without any
design at all, becomes a far more brilliant and attractive piece (or
piecing) of work than was the original. I have seen a thorough
artist in his studio discard an almost finished picture, which
seemed to my somewhat particular eye uncommonly good, and
recommence the work on a fresh canvas, simply because in the
first he had not come up to his own ideal; and, after a time, I
have testified to the vast improvement on the first picture when
he has completed the same subject on his second canvas.
So it is with Mr. George Edwardes and his musical plays;
so it is with this present musical play, written by Messrs.
Tanner and Nicholls, lyricised by Ross and U keen-bank ; music
composed for it by Caryl and Monckton; which music, light
and full of tune and go, presents no striking novelty, no very
original and catching melody; and, as the music, so the piece,
which being bright, light, uninteresting but amusing, easy, not
brilliant dialogue, and with nothing to arrest the attention
in business or situation, carries one along for three hours
through a pleasant song-and-dance country, presenting, how-
ever, few features that can compare with the charming San
Toy, the delightful Geisha, or the eccentric Messenger Boy.
But, on the Edwardes' method, it may yet rival and beat all its
predecessors, outrunning them all with two or three hundred
nights in hand.
As far as "character" may be looked for in such a piece,
Mr. George Grossmith, Junior, with his song "Everybody's
awfully good to me," by Paul Rubens, has the best of it; whila
for eccentricity Mr. Edmund Payne's Sammy Oigg the tiger is
incomparable. Ah! what couldn't Mr. Edmund Payne do if—
but no matter, let's take him as he is and for what he is, and
rejoice in him as " a thing of beauty and a joy for " the entire
run of any piece in which he plays a leading part. Mr. Lionee
Mackinder represents one of those modern musical-piece young
men whose special mStier came into existence with Hay'Don
Coffin's success, and who are gradually settling down into a
recognised classification as "Gaiety-good-young-man, A Go-
with-the-girls young man," who can dance a bit, sing a bit,
speak a bit, "here a bit and there a bit, and everywhere a bit,"
and all good of its kind. With Edmund Payne is associated
bright Miss VIOLET LLOY'D, and their duets and eccentric charac-
ter dances are capital; but in their predecessors they have
"ower dangerous" rivals.
Miss Claire Romaine has the best song in the piece, " Maud"
(not the elderly spinster invited into the garden), which meets
with hearty encores; while Miss Marie Studholme and Miss
Florence Collingbourne have, with Messrs. Grossmith and
Mackinder, the pick of the quartette singing and dancing.
Miss Maidie Hope comes out well with Mr. Rubens' song of
"The Tordador"—(very rash of Mr. RUBENS to choose such a
subject, and clever of him to get away entirely from the only
"Toreador contento" so familiar to all of us)—and Miss
QUEENIE Leighton gives so much of intensity to the jealousy of
Dona Teresa as brings out, in sharp contrast with it, the comic
terror and the absurd amativeness of Mr. Pay'NE.
Mr. Willie Warde is funny as the Bandmaster, his make-up
defying identification; but, for once, having taught everyone
else how to dance, he takes no steps to show what he could do
on his own account. Mr. Ivan Cary'LL working harder as con-
ductor than he seems to have done as composer, gives an
impulse to the plaudits of a crowded and appreciative house.
Summary of evening's entertainment: "great pleasure and
little Payne."
FROM FATHER THAMES TO THE OARSMEN.
Well, boys, you 're here again at Henley, the home of youth
and strength and endeavour; at Henley, where for more than
sixty years my Naiads, the fair, fresh daughters of a hoary
parent, have watched your swift boats cleaving the pellucid
surface of the river, and from the depths below have acclaimed
your skill, your endurance and your triumphs. How is it to be
with you this year? Is the ancient Cup, engraved with so
many noble names, to be won by you, my sons, or is it to be-
come the proud ornament of some foreign, if fraternal, Club?
Shall Leander have it again, shall New College for a year glow
with its possession, or shall I hide my mournful head while the
doughty Pennsylvanians or the brave Belgians carry it in glory
to a distant shore? Many are the chances. I control the
river. It is fair and equal for all. But the winds are tricky,
treacherous customers, fellows of whims and caprices, of sudden
dislikes and an uncontrollable temper. The winds are not
within my rule. Notus, Boreas, and the rest owe fealty to
Aiolus, and JEolus, the lasher of waves, was ever an enemy to
me and mine. Let us flatter him while there is yet time, and
entreat him to send at most a Zephyr, a gentle breeze that may
make the water smile, and blow with equal favour behind the
racing crews.
You, O dauntless Belgians, have visited mc before. I
welcome you again, and wish you well. But for you, friends
from far Philadelphia, I have a special greeting. I like your
pluck, your eager spirit of adventure, your emulous desire
to wrest the trophies of our old world from our hands. A
fair course you shall have, and, for the rest, such fortune
as your skill and vigour deserve. You have come to tug
the old Lion good-humouredly by the beard—not to twist
his much enduring tail. He 's a sleepy beast; see how he
yawns and stretches his big limbs, and looks for all the world
as though effort and agile swiftness were beyond him. But
there's a lire in his eye still, and his muscles are well strung
and—well, I think he's got it in him, and he '11 try his best
now that you 've put him to it. Of one thing you may be sure.
You have come three thousand miles over weary wastes of
ocean, and now you are our friends. We clasp your hands, and
give you place in our brotherhood of oarsmen. Henceforth you
are with us and of us in honour and in all loyal manly strife.
Loss or gain, victory or defeat, what, after all, do they matter?
We play the game—you and we—for the sake of the glorious
game itself. Success is a thing of a moment, defeat nobly
endured can leave no sting. But loyalty and chivalry and
friendship—these remain with us all, a possession for ever.
May your memories of the Old Country, and of the men you
strive against be sweet and pleasant. We shall do all wo can
to make them so.—Yours in friendship and good-will,
Father Thames.

"Pray leave my armorial bearings

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted fkom the Diast of Toby, M.P.
House 0} Commons, Monday, June 24.—
There is nothing small or mean about Mr.
Alfred Pickwick Davitss, Member of
Parliament lor the Carmarthen District.
Ho has all the high-mindedness and simple
dignity of the genial gentleman whose
personality he realises for the present
generation. As a statesman he distrusts
the Colonial Secretary. Carmarthen
District has committed to his hands a
solemn charge he is proud to cherish.
"Keep your eye on Joe," was the last
injunction he received when Carmarthen
District sent him to Parliament.
No one can accuse him of laggard

service in the cause of his country and
of Carmarthen. Ominously early in
career of new Parliament Don Jose
became conscious of a strange magnetic
influence. Unconsciously obedient, he
found his gaze attracted to the lower end
of Front Bench below Gangway opposite,
dan beheld, as he thought, the cherished
hero of his earlier excursion into litera-
ture—Mr. Pickwick. Illusion strengthened
when, a few days after Parliament had
settled down, Member for Carmarthen
rose, and, stepping out half a pace from
tho bench so that there might be more
room for his cocked coat-tail when with
familiar gesture he thrust his hand
beneath it, begged to address to the
Colonial Secretary "a Question of which
I have given him private notice."
There was the same noble brow under
which, ■ astride an unobtrusive nose,

glistened the interrogative spectacles;
the same kindly but firm manner. Almost,
under the trousers with which later
fashion clothed the legs of authority, Don
Jose fancied he could trace the gaiters.
"I will ask the House," added Mr.
Davies, waving his right hand, "to give
the right lion, gentleman their attention
while he kindly replies."
That only the beginning. Since that
day Don Jose has constantly been strained
on the rack by the Member for Carmar-
then. A visit to tho United States, oc-
casioned by international complications
not unconnected with the business of
carriers, gave him an interval of respite.
It was a coincidence, purely a coinci-

The Chief Secretary to the "Lhaid Liff-ten'nt."
(Mr. G-rge W-ndh-m )
dence, that when the newspapers an-
nounced the return of the Member for
Carmarthen to Westminster, the Colonial
Secretary had an attack of gout that
confined him to his room. Last week
Mr. Davies, stepping out to address a
Question to the right hon. Gentleman,
observed his absence and extended grace-
ful assurance of sympathy. Encouraged
by this friendly token, Don Jose to-day
returned to his post. His re-appearance
led to one of those incidents that ennoble
Parliamentary strife and irrigate tho arid
course of party politics.
"Question 57, Mr. Speaker, to the
Colonial Secretary'. And," Mr. Pick-
wick continued with comprehensive wave
of his hand, "I am sure the House will
join me in welcoming the right hon.
Gentleman on his recovery."

On Beya'.f of the Aggericaltural Lubourtr.
(Mr. Br-dh-ret.)
Don Jose visibly affected; master of
himself though Liberal Ministries fall,
his voice now trembled as he made
acknowledgment of this friendly overture.
Prince Arthur suspiciously sniffed as
he unfolded his pocket handkerchief and
gazed reflectively into its depths. In
Strangers* Gallery there was not a dry
eye.
Business done.—Mr. Jemmy Lowther,
looking in from Ascot on his way to
Exeter Hall, delivers a speech prepared
for last Thursday's Debate on the Sugar
Duty. St. Michael and all Angels, resent-
ing tho delay, offers, sotto voce, a few
remarks that sound like extracts from the
Athanasian Creed.
Tuesday night.—St. Michael comes up
quite fresh again with his conundrum,
"What is Small Coal?" For him age
cannot wither nor custom stale its infinite

variety. 'Whenever hard pressed by the
struggling millionaire coalowner he rises,
leans his elbow on desk and remarks, "I
confess there is a good deal in what the
honourable gentleman says; but can he
define Small Coal?"
Of course ho can't; necessarily shuts
up, and Chancellor of Exchequer goes
on his way resistless.
In the end the thing works out admi-
rably. D. A. THOMAS having moved an
Amendment in one of his powerful speeches
rich in eloquent pauses, ST. MICHAEL
followed. "Can the honourable Gentle-
men," he commenced ; whereat there was
howl of despair from the impoverished
millionaires.
"No, no," they cried; "we give it
up."
St. Michael, justly pleased, not disposed
to be outdone in generosity, met sur-
render by liberal compromise.
During his first Session in the House of
Commons, the Member for Sark dined
with a company that included that most
delightful of men the late Lord Gran-
ville. A lady announced the interest-
ing fact that a son had been born to
Robebt Browning and his wife, then re-
sident in Florence.
1' The funniest, oddest thing you ever
saw," she said.
"Ah," smiled Lord Granville, "then
there will now be, not two Incom-
prehensibles, but three Incomprehensi-
bles."
St. Michael has added a fourth. It is
Small Coal. Having established it in the
category, having exacted admission of its
impregnability, he could afford to be
lavish.
"We know," he said, "the limit of
human power, even in this potent
assembly. Wo can't square the circle;
we can't gag Ca'pen Tommy Bowles, and
we can't define Small Coal. But I '11 tell
you what I '11 do. I '11 relieve from the
shilling export duty all coal delivered
free on board at six shillings a ton, and
you may call it small coal or great, as you
like."
David Thomas fell on Joicey's breast,
and dropped a coal-black tear on his
cambric front.
"It is not everything, James," he said,
"but it will save us from starvation. It
will yield a crumb for our little ones, and
a jug of water for the stranger at our
gate. Let us re-Joicey."
To this pitiful depth was reduced an
ordinarily staid colliery owner.
Business done.—Mutual concession ; the
coalowners give up Chancellor of
Exchequer's riddle, Chancellor of
Exchequer gives up portion of Coal
Tax.
Thursday night.—The vital truth that
underlies the observation "One man may
steal a horse whilst another may not look
over the hedge" was illustrated just now
in case of Mr. Weir. On Consolidated
Fund Bill John Dillon nagged at length at
Mr. Brodrick, accusing him of having,
four months ago, misled the House as to
position of the forsaken Boor women in
tho refugee camps. Performance lasted
fully an hour. Brodrick made detailed
reply; John Dillon worked off repeated
rejoinder; Lloyd - George said a few
words.
Mr. Weir, a patient listener, felt his
hour had come; quite a long time since
he had an innings. What with verbosity
of Irish members, activity of the Welsh,
no opening for modest Scotch gentleman.
Now it presented itself. Mr. Weir rose;
solemnly adjusted his pince-nez; through
the House rumbled the noise of tho
hydraulic machinery whereby his voice is
drawn up from the reservoir of his boots.
Click! It was all right; ready for a good
forty minutes' spin.
"Is the right hon. gentleman a-
Weir?"
As in the analogous case of Marmion,
these were the last words of the Member
for Boss and Cromartie. Up sprang
Prince Arthur. "I move that the Ques-
tion be now put," he said.
Mr. Weir slowly sank in his seat, as at
eventide, in far-off Ross, the sun drops
behind Ben Wyvis. There was no appeal.
It was the Closure; brute force brought
to choke off Highland eloquence. One
thing Mr. Weir might do; he could demand
a Division. So when the Speaker put
Question of Closure and declared "the
Ayes have it," a deep-throated "No,"
sustained by a disproportionate quantity
of unused hydraulic power, rolled through
the House.
Thus was Mr. Weir avenged. Prince
Arthur refused him even five minutes in
which to speak. The Division on the
Closure occupied fifteen.
Business done.—Miscellaneous.
House of Lords, Friilay.—Mr. Choate,
hearing that the Moorish Ambassador had
been down to House in a white shirt,
thought it time United States had a look
in. Settled himself comfortably in side
gallery this afternoon, and had refreshing
sleep whilst Lansdowne discoursed on
British Army. Woke up hearing Wolse-
ley referring to America.
'^For its size, mind you, I say for
its size," F. M. repeated, holding up
his little finger, "I call the Array
of the United States the finest in the
world."
"Shake!" said the American Ambassa-
dor, feeling in the neighbourhood of his
moustache with intent to give it a mili-
tary curl. Not finding it, he squared his
shoulders and softly whistled a bar from
"The Star-Spangled Banner."
Business done.—In the Commons PRINCE
Arthur, by this time quite used to the
domestic manoeuvre, abandoned the Infant
Education Bill.

To preserve decorum, only lemonade and
ginger-beer shall bo drunk during the
illuminations, and fireworks shall hence-
forth be restricted to one squib and
a couple of crackers to each house-boat.
Finally, recreation of every kind shall
be discontinued, so that in future the
unpopularity of the County Council on
land shall find its reflection in the universal
detestation in which the Thames Con-
servancy shall be held by those living on
the river.

THE MAN BEHIND THE PEN.
A "Literary " Play.
[" The imratn8e competition among young
publishers, and the hawking round of books to the
highest bidder by the literary agent, has made
publishing a less remunerative pursuit than
formerly; and I have in my mind's eye a number
of publishers whose houses are less magnificent
than those of at least a dozen authors whom I
could name."—Sphere, June 22.]
The scene represents a magnificent ap<irt-
ment in the palatial abode of .
a fashionable Author. The
beautifully carved walls of
sandal-wood, where they are
■not concealed by priceless
tapestries, are hung with
countless "old masters."
Gorgeous portieres of Eastern
design and colouring usurp
the function of doors, and
conceal rows of books bound
"in the best possible taste
and style." The Author lan-
guishes on a Tuscan divan,
chatting airily to a peer or
t wo. All are toying with most
expensive cigarettes. Imme-
diately behind the Author is
a Japanese Idol composed of
several preciousmetals, which
serves as a pedestal for a twin
pair of jewelled typewriters,
while a miniature Indian
Temple (the gift of twenty
Rajahs) contains the gold-
edged paper. Near by stands
a console table, with platinum
and ivory legs, bearing wines

HAUGHTY-CULTUEE.
A gardener at Methering-
ham, in Lincolnshire, has set
up the following announcement
in his garden:
"NOTICE.—Anybody found pinch-
ing vegetables from this garden will
be allot. By Order."
This seems a strong an-
nouncement, especially when
we fail to recollect a single
instance of anyone pinching
vegetables. We have heard of tickling
trout, and have ourselves pinched peaches,
apricots and pears, to ascertain if they
were ripe, but to apply our fingers with
the same object to potatoes, carrots, tur-
nips, kidney beans or even tomatoes, has
never been our custom. In Lincolnshire
the practice may obtain, but surely the
penalty is in excess of the crime? Why
not try a gin on the June-nipper instead
of executing him with fire-arms? The
gardener of Metheringham seems to be
rather too much of a marksman. Of
course, he will shoot the pinchers with
grape-shot.

"THE PARTY" AT THE AVENUE.
Mr. Wkkdon Grossmith has found an outlet for his dual
talent as dramatist and actor at the Avenue Theatre. His new
and interesting play, The Night of the Party, is going
strong. That it should be going strong speaks well both for
company and audience. The piece, although possibly suggested
by such productions as High Life Below Stairs and the Lackey's
Carnival, has a novelty of its own. Mr. Wbedon Grossmith
—must earmark him from Brother Gee-Gee—has made his hero,
"the gentleman's gentleman," very human. In some respects the
life from below stairs might give a lesson to the existence on
a platform a couple of stories higher. The servants pictured
by the author show a chivalry not usually associated with the
atmosphere of the pantry and the house-keeper's room. For
the rest, Mr. Weedon Grossmith is a host in himself, literally
and figuratively, supported by a capital company of comedians.
Miss May Palfrey is charming.

ADDITIONAL ANTICIPATIONS—III.
(By K. Tesian Wells.)
We have already seen by our extracts
from the daily papers of the latter half of
this century, that the readers' time 'will
not be wasted by any attempts at re-
dundant elegance or stately verbosity.
When every needless word is omitted it
would be impossible to imitate Johnson
or Macaulay, or, above all, Blowitz, the
three great masters of literary English.
The journals of the future — consisting
wholly of paragraphs, every paragraph
illustrated in colours—will attract chiefly
by their price, never more than one "flf,"
that is, the fiftieth part of a "twen,"
one-twentieth of a sovereign in the deci-
mal coinage of that period.
Even the leading articles of
the Times, long published in a
separate form every Saturday
at the price of two fifs, will
eventually disappear.
One newspaper, however, the
Tailor and Cutter, will remain
faithful to the finest traditions
of the older journalism. No
one ever saw a tailor or even a
cutter—except a racing cutter
—in a hurry, and no one ever
will. The journal devoted to
the interests of thpse serene
and stately persons will con-
tinue to use language worthy
of them, and in its dignified
leisure it will have time not
only to chronicle the present
but also to review the past.
We have the pleasure of re-
producing, or ante-producing,
from its pages the following
article, entitled "Costume for
Gentlemen in Days of Yore '':—
Amidst the manifold occupa-
tions of this agitated age but
few have leisure or inclination
to study the attire of Auld
Lang Syne, or to investigate
the origin of each species of
garment worn by men, to use the curt
language of the present day, or by
gentlemen, in the more elegant phrase-
ology of a bygone period". Our grand-
parents considered the "topper" hat
a permanent institution of our native
land. They would never have dreamed
that it would eventually be worn by only
one gentleman, the Speaker of the House
of Commons when in the Chair. There
was also the " bowler " hat, still worn by
the umpires at the professional cricket
matches, but why it was named after the
bowler, or whether it was ever worn by
him, the most careful research is unable
to discover. When the ordinary hat of
to-day, which it would be superfluous to
describe, was first introduced, every one
asserted that it would never supersede
the "topper" hat, at least in "Capel
Court," the old name of the Stock
Exchange, still applied to the gigantic
edifice at Highgate, N.C. Yet the last
wearer of this head covering, a venerable
broker, died at an advanced age many
years ago.
It was the same with the " frock-coat,"
not to be confused with a lady's "frock,"
or "petticoat." This ancient garment,
now only to be seen in the Historical
Costume Museum at Chichester, S. S. W.,
a suburb so easily reached for thirty fifs
by the Isle of Wight Motoroad, was once
universally worn by gentlemen in London,
and was considered the fine fleur du
smart. With the "topper" hat it van-
ished in the early days of the primitive
motor, that strange, vibrating, smelling

vehicle which our grandfathers thought
so wonderful, and its place was taken by
the present distingue garment, which,
like the modern hat, it would be super-
fluous to describe. Nor need we refer to
the difference between the modern morn-
ing or afternoon leg-coverings and the
old trousers.
The alterations in evening attire appear
trifling to the unprofessional eye. To
the keener vision of the artistic designer
and connoisseur the subtle variations in
the cut of the trousers—now "peg-top,"
and anon wide-spreading at the ankle—
the delicate nuances in the height of the
coat-collar, and the sowpf ons of change in
the opening of the waistcoat, alike breathe
a whisper of that eternal evolution, that
persistent, though gradual, adaptation to
the environment, which is the natural law
of the entire universe. Unaltered amidst
these variations, the exquisite white ex-
panse of the snowy shirt front remains as
it was at tlio beginning of the century.
Fashions in day garments—literally the
ephemeridm of our art—have altered in
accordance with the changes in locomo-
tion, in occupation and in life generally,
but the evening attire of the English
gentleman seems eternally fixed.
In one respect it has advanced. Sixty
or seventy years ago the crease in the
trousers became the fashion. Now that
all gentlemen, and even some authors,
artists and other persons usually in-
different to their appearance, have their
complete evening attire pressed every
day, the effect is much finer. The ancient
Greeks themselves would have
gazed in astonishment at the
elegant habitues of the New
Opera House at Cambridge, N.,
or the Riverside Music Garden
atOxford.W.,those two suburbs
(so conveniently situated with-
in the half-twen zone on the
Western and and Northern
Motoroads) which are especi
ally devoted to the encourage-
ment of music, literature and
the arts in general.
It was our good fortune to
attend the Japanese Opera
Cycle at Cambridge, and to
observe with admiration the
appearance of those gentlemen
who had just coino on by motor
from dinner at the newest
Restaurant d'Ete of the Cercle
Gastronomique do Londres on
the Norfolk Broads. Nothing
could be handsomer than the
appearaTice of an English gen
tleman in the evening, during
this, the second, half of the
twentieth century, with an
unbroken crease down each leg,
down each arm, down the middle
of his back, and at each side of
his rigid shirt-front, looking
the words of a distinguished
to quote
critic of sartorial art, " as though ho were
clothed in cardboard." H. D

Dearest Mabel,—You ask me to keep

that a fresh craze may be sprung upon us
before I have finished this letter, in which
case I will wire. I daresay you know
that Bridge, Ping-pong, and Vint have be-
come successively demodes. "Gryllo," a
combination of cricket and tennis, was
started a day or two ago at the Queen's
Club and is now out of date. Some genius
law-twice-removod, you know), who is
considered the best^dressed man in town,
now wears a smock-frock down Picca-
dilly, and is taking lessons in weeding
and gravel-scratching from a professor
every morning in the Row. His whim
has caught on quite wonderfully, and a
new type of liver-brigade has been
evolved. Sir Mangell Worsell, who is
nothing if not original, has obtained per-
mission from the various local authorities
to plant potatoes and other esculent roots
in the different entrenchments now to be
found in the Strand, Regent Street, and
elsewhere. He says, quite rightly, that
the ditches are there for months, and may
as well be utilised.
Smart Mrs. Gyles-Hodoson has started
a real roof-garden (not one of the Ameri-
can sort) among the chimney-pots of her
charming Park Lane house. She has some
special pets in the shape of three dwarf
scarlet-runners, which find the soot of
those elevated regions most congenial.
The youngest she has had potted, and

of her lap-dog. All Mayfair now clambers

A DESERTER'S MEDITATION.
Sultry is the summer day,
And the lawns are cool and shady,
On them throngs, in raiment gay,
Round me many a lovely lady;
While afar the dull debate
Plods with dilatory dripping.
On things of state
I meditate,
From cooling cups at leisure sipping.
Far from tongues' discordant strife,
'Mid fair scenes I fain would hide me,
Snatching hours of happy life
While sweet Daphne sits beside me;
What though cares of statesman-
ship—
Clearest, plainest duty—blinking,
The watchful whip
I had to slip,
Out of the House in secret slinking?
What though irate leaders come
With their "black lists" to impeach
me?
In these shades the distant hum
Of their threats can hardly reach me.
Heedless what the vulgar deem,
Who with politics are fussing,
To me this cream
And strawberries seem
Matters much better worth discussing.

PEOPLE WHO PALL ON ME.
V.—The Critical Man.
Criticism, like the cold-water douche,
is refreshing—at intervals. But some folk
overdo the cold-water business altoget her.
Of such a kind is the critical man. He
is only bearable in the hot summertime of
violent emotion. Then a little of him,
just like an occasional [ice, may have a
cooling effect. But, on the whole, the
critical man is not suited to our English
climate, and if you have any enthusiasms,
better cover them up with the waterproof
of a cheerful dogmatism before you meet
him: otherwise, depend upon it, ho will
chill the poor things through and through
by swamping them with frigid question-
ings.
The critical man, who prides himself
upon his level-headedness, flatters him-
self that he is never swept away by the
current of strong emotion, and has con-
structed for himself logical tunnels which
run beneath the tidal passions and convey
his opinions smoothly along to their des-
tination, while the electric light of com-
mon-sense sheds a hard radiance upon the
course.
Considered as a companion, the critical
man is the reverse of exhilarating: it is
disagreeable to walk beside a man who
uses stilts. You can put up with a taller
man than yourself, but a man who raises
himself artificially and then takes credit
for looking down on you—that is not to be
borne with.
The critical man is usually good-
tempered, but there must be something
wrong about a man who persistently keeps
his temper. It isn't healthy to keep aloof
from emotional athletics.
The critical man boasts that he has
scarcely any prejudices. Unhappy wight!
One would as soon admire an old house
the better because all the lichen and ivy
has been removed.

"Charles the First," revived for only a few performances,
to be repeated again, it is to be hoped, if pre-arrangements
permit, "walked and talked " last week; but Sir Henry Irving
has not as yet given us enough of " Wills's Mixture," whereof
the flavour is delightful. As the lovable but weak King, Irving
is at his very best. His manner, his figure, his smile, all so
pathetic, that no one, save a being of Scrooge-liko type,
with a strong spice of Fifth-Monarchy man in him, seeing the
representation could have the heart to adapt the Cibberian
version of Ricliard the Third to the occasion and exclaim, " Off
with his head! So much for Charles Stuart!" In fact, had
Sir Henry been Charles the First he would never have been
beheaded; but had Charles been Henry he would have lost
his head over the management of the Lyceum long ago, and
been sent to the block by some stony-hearted Cromwellian
Syndicate. The only " block" at present is that of carriages
and cabs in the Strand, Covent Garden, and Wellington Street,
on the occasions when the unfortunate monarch is fortunately
revived. Vivat Rex I
Then the opportunity afforded to our own Ellen Terry!
Are we not all ready to join with her with one heart and voice,
and with tears in our eyes, in that touching and eloquent
appeal to the stubborn man of destiny, Cromwell, as admirably
represented by Mr. Tyars, as is the honest and faithful
servitor by Mr. Barnes.
The Lyceum should be to Londoners what the Francais is to
the Parisians. Here is a varied collection! Place side by side
as companion portraits HENRY Ihvinc'S First Charles and his
Eleventh Louis. They are historical studies worthy of any stage:
the one play original, by an Englishman; the other a clever
English adaptation of the play by M. Casimir Delavignk, but
quite an English classic associated with the names of Charles
Kean (whom the present deponent just remembers in it, and,
remembering, shall never forget), and Phelps, whom the same
deponent never saw in this particular part, and it is difficult to
imagine him as having been equal to either Kean or Irving.
The part with its cynicism, its sardonic smile, its good humour
under flattery, its abject superstition, tiger-like ferocity, and its
display of grovelling fear of death, is one which gives the actor
opportunities afforded him probably by no other part in his
repertoire, and from which he extracts the very utmost effect
possible.
No one who cares for English drama at its best should miss
such a rare display of histrionic genius as can now be seen
"for a few nights only"—alas!—at the Lyceum. Pity that
this entire season has not been devoted to these most popular
revivals! Sir Henry might have kept Corry O'Lanus for a1
little tour in Ireland and then on to America, and Corry would
have [done well for a few nights, alternating with The Lyons
Mail and The Dells, on which he could have rung the changes,

THE LOST FOLLOWER.
[Note.—The Leader of the Liberal Party, being himself somewhat in
doubt as to the issue of Tuesday's impending conference, has felt unable to
render the author any useful assistance in his composition.]
Just for a mouthful of dinner he leaves us,
Just for a bumper to mellow his heart;
False is the sigh that the hypocrite heaves'us,
Wishing we too could be taking a part.
Had he withdrawn at the summons of duty,
Pressure of work, let us say, at the Bar,
How had our sympathy, tearful and fluty,
Mourned the eclipse of a promising star!
How we had felt for him, visibly thinner,
Worn to a shadow by zeal for the law,
Running no risk of incurring at dinner
Pangs for his conscience and pains for his maw
We that remarked his forensic proclivities
Under that other redoubtable chief,
Fostered and flattered his latent abilities,
Letting him have an occasional brief—
We that beneath an identical banner
Fought at his side to dismember the Church,
Dimly adopting his Ballinl manner—
We are the ones that he leaves in the lurch!
Morley was for me, Sir WILLIAM was one with me,
Battersea Burns with my canse had combined ;—
He (the unmentioncd) has openly done with me,
He has announced that he means to be dined!
Picture what pattern of barbarous victuals
Such an occasion will place in his hands;
Boer's-head and bully-beef, lager (with skittles)
And the dum-dumpling that goes and expands!
We, too, have dined ; he will plead our example,
Hint how we feasted for personal ends,
How, being full, we proceeded to trample
Right on the toes of our dearest of friends.
Well, if my section waxed fat, when they fed it,
Even discharging the opening brick,
Still I can always recover my credit
Keeping a trump for the " confidence " trick.
As for this duplicate banquet's verbosity,
While I am all for opinions at play,
Candid respect and polite reciprocity,
I should suggest he were better away.
Yet, if I reckon the ultimate cost to mo
(Here I allude to the moral expense),
'Tis but a paltry Imperial lost to me
When I return to my roost on the fence;
Back to the perch that I ought to have stopped on,
Back from the nervous exhaustion and strain,
Back from the definite sphere that I dropped on,
Back to ambiguous postures again t O. S.

ROUNDABOUT LONDON.
(Concerning tlie Four-mile Radius.)
The would-be driver was applying for a
licence.
"How would you get from Charing
Cross to Victoria Station?" asked the
Examiner.
"I would go up Bond Street by Suffolk
Street, the Haymarket, Regent Stroet,
and Burlington Gardens, then get into
South Audley Street and come round
by Sloane Street, Pont Stroet, Baton
Square and Hobart Place."
"Wouldn't that be rather a circuitous
route?"
"Well, it could not strictly be charged
the whole distance by the mile, because
it would come to more than the measured
allowance issued by Scotland Yard."
"Why not go by Parliament Street
and Victoria Street?"
"Because Parliament Street would be
probably up for alterations, and Victoria
Street closed for repairs."
"You wouldn't go by Pall Mall and the
Park, and then through Buckingham Palace
Road?"
"Certainly not; for one of those
thoroughfares would be sure to be blocked
by something or other."
"Then you think the route you have
indicated the wisest?"
"Yes, and in the long run it would be
found to be the shortest."
"If you had to drive from Charing Cross
to the Mansion House, how would you go?"
"Chiefly by Holborn and north of
Newgate Street."
"And from Charing Cross to London
Bridge?"
"Round the Bank and over the New
Tower Bridge via. Finsbury Circus."
"And why would you take these seem-
ingly roundabout courses?"
"Because I would have to consider the
ups and downs of the Metropolitan roads."
"And you believe that the Metropolitan
roads would be chiefly?"
"Would be chiefly ups. So, you see,
Sir, I know my London fairly well."
"Yes," replied the Examiner, "you
do ; and, what is more useful, you know
your London County Council even better."
And the would-be driver received his
certificate.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Bights and Wrongs of the Transvaal War (Arnold) is essentially
a sane book. Its author, Mr. E. T. Cook, equipped in many
ways for his task, is, above all, gifted with a judicial mind.
Had he been called to the Bar, and enjoyed even remote blood-
relationship with the Lord Chancellor, he would, ere this, have
been a priceless addition to the judicial bench. As things
went, he was content to sit for a while in the editorial chair of
a daily newspaper, to which he brought access of the dignity
born of absolute independence of judgment, keen insight into
public affairs, and inflexible courage. His book [charac-
teristically partakes rather of the summing-up of a j>idge
than of the views of an advocate. The task he set himself was
to trace the war back to its ultimate causes, to recall the secret
events immediately preceding it, and to set forth the actual
course of negotiations. For the student of history coming to
his task to-day or to-morrow the book is invaluable. Mr. Cook
has a pale passion for Blue Books. Ho has unrestrainedly in-
dulged in it, boiling down into a not too portly volume all that
relates to the War in South Africa. He frankly admits belief
that, substantially, Great Britain has been in the right and the
Dutch Republics have been in the wrong. If the reader, on
laying down tho book, arrives at the same conclusion he will
admit that it is due, not to special pleading on the part of the
author, but to the irrefragable logic of facts. In an appendix
re-appear the two valedictory articles which startled the
readers of a historic morning newspaper on the eve of a great
collapse. Their dignified tone, maintained through painful
circumstances, will find all journalists in agreement with my
Baronite in hoping that the time is not far distant when
British journalism will again see Mr. Cook in one of its princi-
pal chairs.
No one can commence reading The Serious Wooing (Methuen),
by "John Oliver Hobbes " (Mrs. Craigie still retains her nom
de plume), without in a very short time becoming deeply
interested in every one of her characters, according to their
measure of importance. It is the simple story, worked out with
singular cleverness, and with masterly insight into character,
of a strongly loving man, as zealous to indiscretion in the
political cause to which he has given all his energy as he
is when surrendering himself to the overpowering passion of
his love, and of a woman devoted to him heart and soul, as is
he to her; a woman who learns to think as he thinks, to talk as
ho talks; to yield to him unquestioning obedience save in one
thing, and that is, she will not part with him, she will not allow
him to leave her, she cannot bear separation for the very shortest
space, but whether because she mistrusts him or because she
is not sure of herself is not made clear. If they have not
perfect confidence in one another, apart or together, then is
their love not love at all. When Lultrel, ordered away on a
foreign socialistic and revolutionary mission, must go alone,
all that Rosabel, in effect, has to say is, "That she never will
desert Mr. Micawber." But both have to yield to fate, and
both are the victims of the machinations of a set of well-dis-
posed,ordinary worldly persons (every one of them artistically
individualized) who being self-interested in preserving the
respectability of their friend Rosabel as one of their own rank,
condescend to a series of lies and to acts of meanness and
dishonesty which, to a certain extent, achieve their purpose,
in so far as they temporarily wreck the happiness of Lutlrel
and Rosabel. The whole story is admirably written; and yet,
original as is Mrs. Craigie's stylo the Baron is not infrequently
struck by something in it that reminds him of tho earlier and
less word-entangled Meredith. As, for example, this descrip-
tion of how "Luttrel, much in earnest in matters of justice,
and also fairly reeling with love for the martyr to a monstrous
etiquette," might easily have been an "extract of Early
MEREDITH." Tittering Arthur Wardle, with the fat hands and
testhetie tastes, is delightful as playing the part of Chorus
before the audience, and taking his share in the action as it
is carried on by tho aristocratic coterie. The two scenes in
Chapters vii. and viii. are of the very best high comedy.
The Baron trusts that no lurking feeling of jealousy will pro-
vent Mrs. Craigie from joining him in offering his most sincere
congratulations to " John Oliver Hobbes" on this new work,
which, he fancies, will achieve even a greater popularity than
any of its predecessors writ by the same hand.
Great Men (Grant Richards), verse by Harold Begbie and
pictures by F. Carruthers Gould, is capital fun. The Baron
congratulates both poet and painter (for the illustrations are
in colour,—not of the old "twopence coloured" kind", but
excellent in every way) on their work, which, though jocosely
intended for the nursery, somewhere in the top storey, will
be, the Baron ventures to think, far more popular among the
"grown-ups" in the drawing-room and smoking-room,—
"but that's another 'storey.'" Under the picture of "Mr.
Chamberlain as the Earl of Bkaconsoteld" Mr. Carruthers
GOULD should have added "with thanks for the smjyestion
conveued to him bij Sir John Tenniel's cartoon. Any. 3, 1878,
entitled, 'The Pus de Deux.'" With this exception, all are
thoroughly original and of most happy application.

A CURIOUS CREED.
[" The idiot who praises every country but his own."— W. S. Gilbert.]
Oh, is it not a moral joy, an altruistic pleasure
To vilify one's Native Land with Jeremiah's measure!
"My Country, right or wrong," to say the Jingo may continue,
But as, of course, you can't be right, my Country, I'm agin you!
I never fail to circulate the tale opponents make up,
And any continental lie is good enough to rake up.
I misreport and minimise with gusto our successes;
To think they forward wicked ends my righteous soul distresses!
When things go wrong upon our side, I'm positively skittish;
I burst to hail our Nemesis—" Disaster to the British!"
Nay, where I really am at home is at a foreign meeting,
Where cries of " Mort a Chamberlain / " my gladdened ears are
greeting.
To show my country up's my cue, and enemies of Britain
Cannot outdo in emphasis what I have said and written 1
To show my country up—I gloat upon my holy function;
There isn't much to show, but what there is I ban with unction.
Give me a Cause that militates against the Empire's glory—
I'm ipso facto pro-that^Cause, a " 'gin-Joe " con amore!
I do not blame our soldiers—no, I only say they 're brutal,
Nor do I care how many times I meet with a refutal.
I do not praise the foe, because the foe is not the farmer
Who's fighting hard for Kruger's rights, but our battalions'
armer.
I would conciliate all those who British soil invaded
And lurked in white-flag-flying farms with Mausers ambuscaded.
By general climbing down once more I would our sins diminish,
But not, as Mr. Punch once said,* by " fighting to a finish!"

OCCASIONAL OPERATIC NOTES.
Tuesday, July 2.—Messaline; or, the Tra-lara-Boom-de-ay!
When Mr. ISIDORE DE Lara's Messaline was first produced at
Covent Garden two years ago, Mr. P.'s Operatic Repre-
sentative was "otherwise engaged." But on this present
occasion of its re-production he went early, before house and
orchestra were half filled, and came away early, that is, as
opera-hours go, seeing it was past eleven when the curtain
descended on the second tabteau of Act iii., and there was yet
a fourth act, of which he made free gift to all those who cared
to stop and listen to it, and who were, he is bound to state,
the majority. Well, if the show of hands be in favour of this
opera, your musical-and-dramatio Representative bows to this
expression of their opinion, but cannot compliment them on
their sound judgment. Before giving a final verdict on the
music, it would be only fair to composer and to critic to
hear it again, and, should a doubt remain, then again after
that, stipulating, however, as Mr. P.'s Op. Rep. emphatically
does that, whether it be sung by the present artistes engaged,
or by others, it should be given as at a concert, with vocalists
and orchestra only, and without any dramatic action whatever.
To see it in action—well!—if Mrs. Grundy had been present
with the Misses GRUNDY, it is not absolutely impossible
to imagine that excellent lady as gathering up her skirts and
her opera-cloak, and with tip-tilted nose and distended nostrils
stalking up the gangway of the stalls, followed by her two
marriageable darlings, long before, at all events, the first
scene of the third act was over. She might, perhaps, if a very
decided and ultra-Puritanic Mrs. Grundy, have taken flight at
the close of Act I, but to have remained with her dear innocent
girls all through the "great" scene between Messaline, so
marvellously played by Mile. Calv£, and Helton the muscular
heathen (a part which, considering how the male heavy-
weight has to be artistically contrasted with the voluptu-
ously sensual sorceress, was adequately represented by
Signor Tamaono) would have weighed on the Grundian con-
science for some considerable time: but, while the action
of decorous Madame Grundy might make the Opera 'habitue'
smile, and cause uncovered shoulders to shrug, yet I suspect
that most good men and true women who have sympathised
with and respected Colonel Neuicome when they read of him as
stalking out of the Cave of Harmony, cane on shoulder, re-
moving his boy Clive from the chance of hearing the highly
flavoured ditty sung by fuddled old Costigan, would have
applauded Mrs. Grundy. The more powerful, the more perfect
the acting of Mile. Calve, the stronger would become my
argument against the representation on the stage of such a
situation as occurs in the third act of this Opera.
I think Messieurs Armand Sylvestre and Eugene Morand,
if bound to ohoose Messalina for their heroine, might have
found some more delicate but equally dramatic way of telling
the story. Mr. de Lara had but to set it to music, and, of
course, is not primarily responsible for the libretto. The
Opera which, whatever its future may be, would be vastly
improved by judicious lopping and pruning, is most effectively
"stage'd." There are some striking choruses in it which, as the
"keening" one so "very like a wail," become monotonous
either by actual repetition or by a family resemblance; there
is a telling refrain to the song of Hares in the first act, but it
is dangerously near the lilt of a catching modern music-hall
chorus; then clever M. Gilibert as Myrrhon, has a taking
morceau — 'tis nothing more than that—in which one of the
charming young ladies Tsilla and Leuconaz, represented by
Miss Bliss and Miss Ruby (pretty names both. "How happy
could he be with Ruby, Were Miss Perfect Bliss but away! "),
joins him occasionally.
This scene in the second act seems to have been suggested,
not musically, but dramatically, by a reminiscence of the tavern
scene in Carmen and of the scene in the Huguenots where the
entrance of the watch stops the street riot. To compare small
things with great, as here, all the rioters and revellers, male
and female, flop down on their faces directly someone rushing
in shouts, in effect, "Here's a policeman coming!" and so
remain (much as the gamblers did in Artful Cards, when Mr.
Toole hid under the tabic with a trombone), until the guileless
jEdile, having complimented the tavern-keeper on his respect
for law and order and promised to give him a favourable report
on next licensing day, departs; and scarcely is his back
turned than up they are at it again, their singing, dancing,
drinking, fighting being only interrupted by the appearance of
Helion, the champion of the ring, who is acclaimed much in the
same way as is the Toriador in the second act of Carmen. And,
by the way, Messaline is but Carmen writ large, an Imperial
Carmen. If only the story had been similarly treated by the
librettists.
There's a duet between Hares and Helion, describing how
the latter killed a lion and saved his brother's life ; then the
scene between the muscular heathen and Afessoline; after
this, Brother Hares is tied up in a handy parcel, and is
chucked out of the window into the muddy Tiber. This little
job being satisfactorily finished, merry Messaline expands
joyously, and goes off to finish the evening more suo with the
muscular brother, who is " innocent of the knowledge, dearest
chuck," but would not, if he knew it, " applaud the deed."
Next scene: banks of Tiber: illuminated window, Fantoccini
show size, on opposite bank where muscular brother and
Messaline don't appear like "ombres Chinoises," which is a
great opportunity lost by librettist and stage manager. Hares
is rescued from drowning by the Roman Humane Society, is
dried in less than a second, seizes a knife from somebody
who has no immediate use for such an article, and hurries
off, eager for vengeance, while invisible chorus and the light
soprano, Tyndaris (Miss NlCHOLLS), sing these delightful words:
"Ho eho O .... h^ ah Leiya . . . Leiya . . . Eiya! Leiya!
. . . Ah! Ah !" which for real poetry and grace of expression
can alone be equalled, though hardly surpassed, by those
immortal words so often recurring in British minstrelsy,
namely, "Tol de rol lol 1 Pal de ral lal! Tooral li da! and
Tral de ral lara!"
Wednesday.—To-night Les Huguenots. Always welcome! It
should draw all Exeter Hallites to hear what Albert Smith
used to call The Hug-me-nots; or, Pop go the Protestants. De
Marchi as Raoul and Mile. Breval as his Valentine admirable
in the great "Tu m'orai" duet, and, for the matter of that,
excellent throughout. Suzanne Adams a brilliantly vocalising
queen, causing notes of the highest value to be issued Tand
taken for all their worth by thoroughly appreciative audience.
Plancon impressively noble as St. Bris; M. Journet a Marcel
not quite so rough and ready as that stern Puritan soldier
would have been, but singing as never a nasal-toned Puritan
private ever could have sung. Delightful exercise for linguists
to-night, French "as she is sung," and likewise Italian. There
may have been German, English, and Norwegian in the chorus,
but what does that matter? Music is not for one language,
but for all tune and for all time; and the music, like the play,
"is the thing." And "What's the odds, as long as it's a
success?"—which it was.
Under the Waves.—The Paris Figaro states that the sub-
marine boat Onstave Zede passed unobserved through the
entire line of the French Mediterranean Fleet and torpedoed
the iron-clad Jauriguiberry. This fact appears to surprise
the French critics. May we therefore suggest that the
present submarine's name should be altered to Giistaue, ou le
Mauvais Sujet. Quite a Paul de Kockboat. But, all the same,
though the submarine boat does play uncommonly low down,
yet, if "out of sight," its proceedings should not be "out of
the mind" of our own Admiralty.

REFLECTIONS OF A MOTOR-RACER.
Two a.m.! Time to get up, if I'm to
be ready for tho great Paris-Berlin race
at a.30. Feel very cold and sleepy. Pitch
dark morning, of course. Moon been
down hours. Must get into clothes, I
suppose. Oilskins feel very clammy and
heavy at this hour in the morning. But-
ton up tunic and tuck trousers into top-
boots. Put on peaked cap and fasten
veil tightly over face, after covering eyes
with iron goggles and protecting mouth
with respirator. Wind woollen muffler
round neck and. case hands in thick dog-
skin gloves with gauntlets. Look like
Nansen going to discover North Pole.
Or Tweedledum about to join battle with
Tweedledee. Effect on the whole un-
pleasing.
Great crowds to see us off. Nearly ran
over several in effort to reach starting
post. Very careless. People ought not
to get in the way on these occasions.
Noise appalling. Cheers, snatches of
Mameillaise, snorts of motors, curses of
competitors, cries of bystanders knocked
down by enthusiastic chauffeurs, shouts of
qendarmes clearing the course. Spec-
tators seem to find glaro of acetylene
lamps very confusing. Several more or
less injured through not getting out of
the way sufficiently quickly. At last the
flag drops. We are off.
Pull lever, and car leaps forward. 'Won-
der if wiser to start full speed or begin
gently? Decide on latter. Result, nearly
blinded by dust of competitors in front,
and suffocated by stench of petroleum.
Fellow just ahead particularly objection-
able in both respects. Decide to quicken
up and pass him. Can't see a foot before
me on account of his dust. Suddenly run
into the stern of his car. Apologise.
Can't I look where I'm going? Of
course I can. Not my fault at all. Surly
fellow! Proceed to go slower. Fellow
behind runs into me. Confound him, can't
he be more careful? Says he couldn't see
me. Idiot!
Put on speed again. Car in front just
visible through haze of dust. Hear distant
crash. Confound the man, he's run into
a dray! Just time to swerve to the right,
and miss wreck of his car by an inch.
Clumsy fellow, blocking my road in that
way. At last clear space before me. Go
up with a rush. Wind whistles past my
ears. Glorious! What's that? Run over
an old woman? Very annoying. Almost
upset my car. Awkward for next chap.
Body right across the road. Spill him to
a certainty. •
Morning growing light, but dust thicker
than ever. Scarcely see a yard in front of
me. Must trust to luck. Fortunately
road pretty straight here. Just missed big
tree. Collided with small one. Knocked
it over like a ninepin. Lucky I was going
so fast. Car uninjured, but tree done for.
Man in car just ahead very much in my
way. Shout to him to get out of the light.
Turns round and grins malevolently.
Movement fatal. He forgets to steer and
goes crash into ditch. What's that he
says? Help? Silly fellow, does he think
I can stop at this pace? Curious how
ignorant people seem to be of simplest
mechanical laws.
Magnificent piece of road here.
Nothing in sight but a dog. Run over it.
Put on full speed. Seventy miles an hour
at least. Can no longer see or hear any-
thing. Trees, villages, fields rush by in
lightning succession. Fancy a child is
knocked down. Am vaguely conscious of
upsetting old gentleman in gig. Seem to
notice a bump on part of car, indicating
that it has passed over prostrate fellow
citizen, but not sure. Sensation most
exhilarating. Immolate another child.
Really most careless of parents leaving
children loose like this in the country.
Some day there will bo an accident.
Might have punctured my tyre.
Chap in front of me comes in sight.
Catching him up fast. He puts on full
speed. Still gaining on him. Pace terrific.
Sudden flash just ahead, followed by loud
explosion. Fellow's benzine reservoir
blown up apparently. Pass over smoking
ruins of car. Driver nowhere to be seen.
Probably lying in neighbouring field. That
puts him out of the race.
Eh? What's that? Aix in sight?
Gallop, says Browning. Better not, per-
haps. Road ahead crowded with spec-
tators. Great temptation to charge
through them in style. Mightn't bo
popular, though. Slow down to fifteen
miles an hour, and enter town amid frantic
cheering. Most interesting. Wonder-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from thi Diary oi Toby, M..P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 1.—
"I suppose you've heard?" the Sqvjire
OF Malwood said to JOHN MORLEY -when
latter took his seat at end of Front Bench
in time for Questions.
"Heard -what?" said JOHN gloomily,
for now that Milner man is authorised,
Parliament not sitting at the Cape, to
issue warrants to meet the expenditure
for the public service.
"Asquith's going to the dinner at the
Hotel Cecil."
"No," cried Honest John, a fresh
wrinkle stealing over his pensive brow,
"Wouldn't have thought it of him. I
confess that, Oliver Cromwell and Burke
you see what I'm leading up to? Asquith
at another meeting, where 1 suppose there
was some sort of a dinner, emphatically
denies my assertion. That was unneces-
sary; it was rude to an old colleague; but
there matters might have rested. Instead
of which, they propose to dine Asquith,
in order that he may trounce us! Now
that's what I call going too far. It's
traitorous to the Liberal Party, playing
into the hands of the enemy."
"Exactly," said the SQUIRE, stroking
one of his chins, "but didn't we—ahem!
—rather begin it?"
"Certainly we had a dinner, but that
was the dinner of the Liberal Party. C.-B.,
our—I mean their—esteemed leader, was
present, and he wouldn't have been if the
gathering had been that of a section
must limit his remarks within briefest
space of time; only one Member may
speak in criticism, he equally tied and
bound in matter of minutes. Think of
that, when a whole summer night might
be wasted in making speeches that would
have no possible effect on Bill, which will
be fully discussed on Second Beading and
moulded in Committee.
This bad enough; worse still, John
O'Gorst, who might have spoken for ten
minutes, occupied only four. True, in that
time he said everything that was possible
or useful. But insult was added to injury.
Opposition angrily protested the thing
couldn't be done in tin minutes. Lo ! it is
accomplished in four. Bryce, ordinarily
the mildest-mannered man that ever sat
in Opposition, quite in tantrums.

"WAR TO THE KNIFE AND FORK," OR THE DREAD ARBITRAMENT OF DINNER.
being no more, my faith in man was
weakened. Now it is shattered. Con-
sider the situation. You and C.-B. are
the honoured guests at a dinner given at
the Holborn Restaurant with intent to
extol the Boer and decry our fellow-
countrymen at the front in South Africa.
I drop in, accidentally as it were, hoping
I don't intrude. You, in your clever way,
drag me to the front, and I make a speech
in which I avow belief that Asqdith,
Grey, Henry Fowler, and other mis-
guided persons, seeing error of their
ways, are chiefly anxious to find oppor-
tunity of recanting their so-called patrio-
tism.
"Very well, you follow me? I don't
mean, of course, as a political leader. I
know my place. On the Front Bench we
are two; I'm the Party and you 're the
Leader. That in parenthesis. I mean
numerically insignificant. No one can
call me an extreme man. I am all for
compromise. You've read me On Com-
promise f What I call compromise is, that
since wo began the business of disintegra-
tion at the Holborn Restaurant, let us
leave it there. For the majority of the
party to go and dine at the Hotel Cecil
and denounce us is flat burglary. Could
anything be fairer or more logical?"
"N—n—no," said the Squire, stroking
the other chin, " I think not."
Business done.—Still in Committee on
the Budget.
Tuesday night.—Opposition fallen on evil
times; like Mrs. Qummidge of blessed
memory, it is "a lone, lorn crittur and
every think goes contrairy." Final blow
fell to-night when John O'Gorst brought in
Education Bill under Ten Minutes' Rule.
That means Minister introducing Bill
"The extreme brevity of the right hon.
Gentleman's speech," he said, severely
regarding the inoffensive John O'Gorst,
"does not minimise the objection we take
to bringing in this important measure
under the Ten Minutes' Rule."
Thereupon, Bryce p.acceded to deliver
one of the most effective speeches he
ever contributed to debate. Time strictly
limited; no room for verbiage. Spoke for
seven minutes, crystallizing objections
to the Bill. Every sentence rap of a
hammer. A valuable object-lesson for
House; hope it will be studied and bear
fruit. What we want is not restriction
but extension of Ten Minutes' Rule.
With rare exception, all Ministerial Bills
should be brought in under its beneficent
ordering.
Business done.—Quiet night in Com-
mittee on Budget.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [July io, 1901.
T/nirsday nifilrt.—C.-B. coming back at
eleven o'clock, slipping quietly into his
place, amazed lo find things in state of
uproar. Sr. John BRODRIC'K on his legs,
stirring up with long polo Irish Members,
Welsh Members and Mr. LaBOCCHERE.
That all very well. A hot night, but
battle is the business of "War Minister,
and if Brodrick likes to engage in it
with the thermometer at 90° in the shade
it is a free country. Quite another thing
when, catching sight of C.-B., he suddenly
turned upon him. Members of his party,
he said, habitually championing case of
Boers; attended public meetings where
resolutions were carried affirming right-
eousness of independence of the Boer
States.
"It is a novelty in the history of the
House," BRODRICK added, "that on a
question of this importance the Leader of
the Opposition should absent himself and
refrain from expressing an opinion."
"1 was under the impression," said
C.-B., with air of injured innocence that
well becomes him, "that this was an
ordinary financial debate. Up to approach
of eight o'clock things were as dull as
ditchwater. 1 assumed it was an occasion
on which I might follow the example of
hon. Members opposite, who are in the
habit of spending their Parliamentary
evenings in more pleasant localities."
The Member for Sark, who never tells
tales out of the dining-room, whispers to
me that the pleasant locality C.-B. has
just returned from is in the neighbour-
hood of Bruton Street. An older gene-
ration of Members of both Houses
remember it as the hospitable homo of
the late Lord Granville. To-night a
later host worthily kept up traditions of
the historic dining-room where, before
Granville bought his costly mansion
on Carlton House Terrace, men who
made English history often sat at meat.
Dinner given in honour of JOHNBOBINSON,
Knight, who made the Daily New*, and
revolutionised British journalism by
establishing the practice of using the
telegraph instead of the pen for word-
pictures from the battle-field. C.-B. heard
much of late designed to make dinners
distasteful; found this an exception. A
notable gathering to do honour to the
Master Journalist. In addition to col-
leagues, some of whom worked with
him on the old paper for a quarter of a
century, there were the Squire of Mal-
wood, who has intimate acquaintance
with the contributor to the morning news-
paper wont tosign himself " Historicus ";
the Red Earl, now, alack, growing grey;
Lord Aberdeen, Lord Brassey, the ever-
buoyant Lord Cork, the mute but not
inglorious Lord "Wklby ; Earl CARRINGTON,
faithful among the faithless found; a
former private secretary of Mr. G.'s; an
old Liberal Whip, and others known only
to fame.
To leave this cheerful circle and sud-
denly fall into cauldron of Parliamentary
wrangle painful experience. C.-B., as
usual, made the best of it.
"The fact is, dear boy," ho said,
mopping his massivo brow, "the new
century has invested dinners with a novel
danger. If there isn't a row at the table,
you are sure to come in for one im-
mediately after."
Business done.—War Loan Bill read a
second time. Sudden flare-up at con-
clusion of placid debate.
Friday.—Strolled into the Gallery in
Bond Street, where P. C. G.'s political

is familiar with reproduction of these

naturally follows, bought in their original

measure their exquisite humour. In the
main good-tempered; occasionally mor-
dant with one subject only. The differ-
ences between P. C. G.'s Markiss and his

ling what manner of men they were

FARTHEST SOUTH.
[" A South African Pboklem.—What shall
we do with our daughters? The modern answer
to the conundrum, as furnished by an important
conference, is that we should send them to South
Africa, there to join hands in the work of colonisa-
tion with those active and energetic countrymen of
ours who, at the close of the war, will find a
permanent home in the Colonies." — Daily
Telegraph, July 3.]
The Hon. Mrs. Getemoff, in an eloquent
address on the subject of emigration,
remarked that, so thoroughly was her
heart in this work, that if she could find
a suitable chaperon, she would not object
to sending her own dear girls out—she
had heard that thero were plenty—oh,
heaps !—of eligible men—she meant ele-
gant occupations — in South Africa for
ladies. Her DOROTHEA, for instance,
could teach the natives figure-skating, a
most useful accomplishment, and one
which, up to the present, was quite un-
known upon the Veldt. (Applause.)
The Duchess of Halghtyshire said that
Bertie Fitzass, who had just been
(promptly) returned from the front, had
assured her that there were plenty of
high-class openings for women in South
Africa. A nurse's dress was very becom-
ing, and of course, one need not do more
than sit with the patients an hour or two
a day. She, the Duchess, would suggest
starting Pagodas for afternoon tea all
over the Veldt, from Cape Town to the
Zambesi. She did not quite know who
the Zambesis were, but they had certainly
been settled in Africa ever since she
could remember. (Applause.)
Mrs. Cutadasu, who spoke rather
rapidly, making reporting somewhat diffi-
cult, said that there were lots of ways to
make money in South Africa, if only the
right sort of women went out. (Applause.)
Sho suggested that dressmakers, those
who really had a knowledge of Worth's
latest things, would be immensely appre-
ciated by both Boer and Kaffir ladies. Of
course, at present, the latter didn't dress
well—if at all; but their tastes must be
educated up to the latest things from
Paris. Thero would be no difficulty in
this. (Applause.) Sho herself had never
found any women reluctant to dress in
things that were really chic, no matter of
what nationality they—the women—were,
and sho saw no reason why the Kaffir
women should not take to Paris fashions as
a duck takes to green peas—she meant to
the water. (Great applause.)
The Hon. Mrs. DRESSWELL thoroughly
endorsed the sensible observations and
practical suggestions of the last speaker.
Good dressmaking would mean the making
of the Cape. ("Oh, oh I")
A proposition that some women should
go out as domestic servants and house-
keepers w'as at once negatived nem. con.,
and the proceedings terminated with a
vote of thanks to the Chair-woman.

A GOUTY COURTSHIP.
His Diary.
Royat, July 4th.—Arrived hero to-day from London, con-
demned by doctor to twenty-one days •without the option of a
fine I In other words, I have to swill tepid water at a bubbling
fountain, soak myself daily in a running bath and undergo a
gentle massage treatment at the hands of an expert Swede for
three consecutive weeks, and all because my forefathers drank
too much port, and left me as a heritage the most unmistakable
signs of gout. Yes, in the flower of my youth (I am only thirty-
three) I find myself extremely "dicky" on one leg, and my
hitherto angelic temper is rapidly changing to chronic irasci-
bility. Gout at thirty-three! It is sickening, disgusting,
absolutely ridiculous. I was told that I should find Royat
delightful. Two casinos, two theatres, bands playing all day,
baccarat and petits ehevaux, health restored—in fact, a perfect
little Paradise on earth. I have already seen all the former
attractions. I have lost a few louis at the "little horses," I
have been politely invited to become a member of the Baccarat
Club, but I experienced a shock on hearing a lady, who was
dining at the next table to mine, say, "It is my seventh season
here—the waters are so good for gout!'' But why seven years
if the waters are any good? Shall I have to come here seven
years? I who already grumble at the prospect of twenty-one
days? I must make this lady's acquaintance, and find out what
she means. Surely she must have been talking nonsense, or
perhaps she has gout on the brain. It seems to me that you
ought either to bo cured, or not, in your first year. Why
persevere seven years?
Royat is empty; the bands play to rows of unoccupied chairs,
a few sepulchral looking cocottes walk listlessly round the
petits ehevaux, and you can inscribe yourself for any hour you
like at the baths. The hotel proprietors say, "Les Anglais nous
manquent cette annee!" I should think so! France has been so
inviting to English people lately.
I have noticed one pretty girl here, and she is staying at this
hotel. But what is the good of thinking of pretty girls when
yon have gout, and a prospect of spending seven seasons at
Royat? 1 close my Diary with renewed reelings of despair.
Her Diary.
Royat, July 4th.—This is papa's tenth day here, and he is no
better. Our excellent doctor, the type of the courtly English
physician, tells him that the waters show no beneficial signs at
first. Papa asks him, with a sarcasm even more suppressed
than his gout, at what period they do begin to show beneficial
signs, and our dear old doctor smiles goodnaturedly and
tells him not to be impatient. All the same, Mamma says
Papa's tempor has certainly improved within the last few days.
His grumbling, which ho feared was becoming chronic, is
certainly less violent and the intervals between the outbursts
of fury are becoming longer. I hope he will really be cured
soon. Royat is so dull, and every second person one meets is
an invalid. By the way, we have got a new man at the hotel. He
is rather nice-looking; but ho, too, looks delicate. He is too
young to have gout, although ho certainly walks a little lame.
Perhaps he has been wounded in the Transvaal. That would
make him rather interesting. We want interesting people in
the hotel—there are only about six men all told, and they are
all what the shops call "damaged goods." I wonder what a
dance would be like here. There is a lawn-tennis club, but 1
never hear of anyone playing. Perhaps it is kept up by
charitable contributions, like the hospital. I went to one little
soiree dansante at the Casino, but there were only the shop-
keepers from Clermont who danced, and Mamma was so afraid
that one of them would ask me to dance that she hurried me
away after the first valse. Ah, well, wo have fifteen days more
to spend here. Ordinarily the "cure" is twenty-one days,
but it appears that Papa's case being an obstinate one requires
four days more. "Your father always was obstinate in every-
thing," Mamma said when she heard this prescription. And to
think that gout is hereditary!
His Diary.
July 5th.—Took my waters, my bath and my massage; feeling
worse—furious.
July Ct/i.—The same as yesterday. Decidedly that English
girl is pretty. Her name is Sombrville—Maud Sombrviixe.
She has red hair, her father has gout. She looks sad and
devoted. Poor girl! What an existence I
July 7th.—She dresses well and has a pretty figure. There is
a mother, a faded, nearly obliterated portrait of the girl. I
should like to make their acquaintance; but they seem to know
no one, and not to care to. After dinner they take their coffee
on the terrace of the hotel and then go to their rooms. I am
not allowed coffee. Took my treatment as usual.
July 8th.—Am I overwhelmed with vanity, or do I fancy that
she looks at me sometimes? Perhaps she pities my lonely
condition. I wonder if she knows what I have the matter with
me. I sat very near them at the band this afternoon, but with
no result. Treatment as usual.
July 9th.—My masseur masses her father's stomach, to aid his
digestion. Scarcely a sufficient introduction. I could not very
well say: "I think we have a mutual friend, who masses your
father's stomach." I must find some other means. Of course,
the usual treatment—which is doing me no good.
July 10th.—Did not see her all day. Masseur said she had
gone for an excursion with her mother. What silly things
excursions are, and how I hate Royat!
July llth.—It appears they have gone to Vichy for two days.
Royat is perfectly loathsome.
July 12th.—She has come back, looking more charming than
ever. She almost seemed to recognise me, and appear pleased
when she saw me at luncheon. It is fine and the place is look-
ing brighter, people arriving every day. Fancy my knee is a
little better.
Her Diary.
July 5th.—Papa is certainly better. Mamma says he swears
with less volubility, and experiences a difficulty in finding fresh
oaths which she has never known before. It really looks as if
the waters were doing him good. The new invalid looks very
dull, and as if he was boring himself to death. Perhaps he is
longing to be back again at the war.
July 6th.—I rather fancy the new invalid would like to make
my—I mean, our acquaintance. Naturally it is very dull for
him, but Papa won't know anyone. He says it is quite enough
to be bored with people at home, without coming abroad to have
fresh inflictions thrust upon one.
July 7th.—His name is Goring—Percy Goring. He is not in
the army. He has gout! What a disillusion. Still, I can't help
pitying him. He is so young to suffer. I hope the waters will
do him good.
July 8th.—We have had an invitation from the Dentons to
spend a couple of days at Vichy. Neither Mamma nor I wanted
to go, but Papa insisted on our going. He said it might do him
good not to see us for two days. A new kind of cure! He has
tried almost every other one. Mr. Goring looks very ill and
sad. I hope he will be looking better when I come back.
July 0th.—He looked so piteously at me to-day. I wish he
was going to Vichy. Mamma says perhaps he drinks—it is
very unusual for a man of his age to havo gout. Papa went
further, and said of course he was a confirmed drunkard. He
could see dissipation written in every line of his face. I can't
—I can only see resigned suffering.
July 10th, Vichy.—Arrived here this morning. It is very like
Royat, only ten times bigger and more crowded. 1 don't think
I should like to stay here.
July llth.—Decidedly, I hate Vichy 1 Thank goodness, wo go
back to Royat to-morrow.1

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Royat, July 12th.—It seemed almost like seeing an old friend
when I saw him coming in to luncheon. Ho limps a little less,
but not much. I fancied he looked reproachfully at me, as much"
as to say, "Why did you go away?" I tried to look as if it
wasn't my fault, as if I would have given anything to stay here.
But all that was rather difficult to get into one look, and I am
not at all sure that I succeeded. Papa is still making improve-
ment. I think he ought certainly to prolong his stay, as it is
doing him so much good. I have told Mamma to tell the doctor
so. She seemed sur-
prised, and said she
thought I disliked Royat.
I said I thought it bettor |
to make the sacrifice a
complete and unique one,
instead of having to re-
turn here year after year.
She agreed with me.
His Diary.
July lZth.— What rot-
ten things introductions
are, and to what a cor-
rupt state Society must
have arrived to require
them! Why can't I speak
to her without being in-
troduced? I think she
would like to know me
and sympathise with my
miserable condition. Sho
has a very sweet voice.
I am sure she would
soothe me, and I want
soothing very badly. If
I don't make her acquain-
tance in two days, 1 shall
finish my treatment at
one gulp and go away. I
shall sit in a bath for
twelve hours at a stretch,
and drink thirty glasses
of water.
July Hth. — She has
gone to Clermont to see
the National fete. I shall
go to Clermont to see the
National fete. Hang the
treatment!
July loth.—No good!
They got lost in the
crowd, and I never saw
them. At dinner the
waiter brought her father
the wrong water — St.
Victor instead of Cesar.
Old man furious; let loose choice Billingsgate. I jumped up
and promptly offered my bottle of Cesar, which waiter had just
brought me. Old man still more furious. "I was not speaking
to you, Sir; t was addressing the waiter." Tears of mortified
humiliation in her eyes, apologies from mother ; but 1 had to
retire defeated. I shall certainly finish my treatment to-
morrow. I shall order a bath for the day!
Her Diary.
July 13th.—It seems very hard that we can't talk to each
other without being properly introduced. I am sure he is
dying to know me, and that wo should have a lot to say to
each other. He has lovely eyes, and they look at me so
reproachfully sometimes. But what can I do?
July 14th.—WTe went to Clermont to see the sports, and the

'CHAOS IS COME AGAIN!"
Or, Things very much Up in the City.
["The following streets were 'up'on July 3 :—Old Broad Street, Threadneedle Street,
Lothbury, Frinc.es Street, Bishoppgate Street, Gracechurch Street, Lendenhall Street,

review, and all tho stupid things of a National fete. In tho
morning, I said in a very loud voice as ho passed us: "I think
it will be very hot at Clermont," with a strong accent on
Clermont; but ho never came, or if he did he must have been
lost in the crowd.
July 15th.—When I have written my day's diary I am going
to bed and have a good cry. Wo had such a terrible scene at
dinner. Papa was very thirsty, and ordered a bottle of Cesar
water. The waiter brought it and poured some out, and Papa
took a gulp, and suddenly
sent it flying in every
direction, accompanied
by the most horriblo
language, partly French
and partly English.
Papa's French is very
elementary ; he can't get
much beyond Sucre.' and
Imbecile! "Vous voulez
poisoner moi?" he yelled
at the waiter. "Vous
savez que Veau St. Victor
il est plein d'arsenic et
moi je dois pas prendre
ca!" And then English
came to his relief, and
he sank back in his chair
purple in the face, and
emitting verbal fireworks
of a very fiery nature.
Then my angelic martyr
came to the rcseuo with
a bottle of Cesar, which
he promptly and gra-
ciously placed at Papa's
disposal. But this only
made him worse — ho
curtly refused it, and
glared at Mr. Goring as
if the bottle he had
offered him was really a
deadly poison. So poor
Mr. Goring retired, fol-
lowed by pleasant little
mutterings such as
"D —d cheek!" "In-
fernal snob!" "Mind
his own blank busi-
ness," etc., etc., and
so now I am going to
bed to cry. The Den-
tons are coming over
to spend the day to-
morrow. Such a nui-
sance!
His Diary.
July 16th.—Hooray! I have made her acquaintance! She
is adorable, perfectly bewitching, and she gains tremendously
on acquaintance—even the acquaintance of a few hours. It
appears that the Dentons—excellent angels of mercy!—are
staying at Vichy. I have known them all my life, and they
actually came here to spend the day with the Somervilles.
It was not an opportunity to let slip; so the moment they came
and spoke to me, I whispered, in hurried, tragic accents, "You
must introduce me to the girl with the red hair—I mean the
Somervilles." "Is it as bad as that?" laughed Mrs. Denton.
"Of course we will, in good time. But you might ask us how
we are, and what we are doing here. JACK has had awful
dyspepsia. He can't digest a simple biscuit, so we are at

Vichy." "How sad!" I answered. "But
don't let's talk about symptoms. I am
much worse than Jack. Tell mo about
the SoMBRvTIXRs." So then I quickly
learnt that she was an only child, adored
by her parents, rich, attractive, gifted,
and very hard to please. "I don't know
how many men she has already refused,"
concluded Mrs. Denton. "It is either
morbid, or a mania with her." This, of
course, is discouraging, but after the in-
troduction had been made I felt less dis-
heartened. I sat at the band with them
in the afternoon, and I was quite charmed
with her easy, unaffected conversation.
Wo carefully avoided the waters, the
baths, and other usual topics of conver-
sation here. She asked me once if I
drank the waters, and I replied with
evasive lightness that I had had a slight
accident to my knee and took them oc-
casionally. Then I adroitly got her back
to safer topics. The Dentons went back
in the evening. I was rather glad—they
had served a very useful purpose, and
I would rather have her to myself. Mrs.
Denton is loud and cheery, aud horribly
energetic. Even her husband's incurable
indigestion doesn't seem to have damped
her spirits. I am looking forward to to-
morrow and every day until she goes,
which, alas! is to be very soon. I coun-
ter-ordered the all-day bath, and resumed
rational treatment. F. C. Ph.

RECLAME A LA REJANE.
During Madame Rejane'9 stay in London
everyone must have seen her pair of very
handsome mules drawing a carriage of a
form sometimes seen in Paris, and
resembling, according to one London
newspaper, a hansom cab. Seeing that it
has four wheels, the box in front, and a
pole for a pair of animals there semblance
is not very apparent. It is, in fact, a
victoria with a fixed wooden hood instead
of a movable leather one. It is extremely
unlikely that this eccentricity of genius
on the part of Madame Rejane will pass
unnoticed or unimitated by the other
leaders of the theatrical world. Next
summer we may expect to read the follow-
ing amongst the "Society " paragraphs.
Madame Sarah Bernhardt was in the
Park yesterday, in a yellow barouche
drawn by four superb zebras, with postil-
lions in amber silk liveries and gilt hats.
Mrs. Lanotry was at Hurlingham in
the afternoon. She had come down in
her miniature green cabriolet drawn by
twp large antelopes of matchless beauty
driven tandem. A negro page, wearing a
green satin turban and green dress studded
with emeralds, stood as " tiger " behind.
Mons. Coquelin (the Society para-
graphist would certainly write "Mons."
instead of "M.") was noticed in Picca-
dilly in his scarlet charrette anglaise,
drawn by a remarkably fine ostrich.
Mr. Tree drove through the Park. The
dashing dromedary in his elegant pink
Irish car excited general admiration.
Mile. Liane de Pougy was shopping in
Bond Street. Her palanquin, painted
pure white, and lined with white velvet
and pearls, was suspended on the backs of
two white sacred bulls from India, led by
Hindoos entirely clothed in white gar-
ments with pearl ornaments.
Mr. Dan Leno was riding in the Row on
his hippopotamus. An unexpected inci-
dent occurred. The animal suddenly
dashed over the footpath and rushed into
the Serpentine. Mr. Leno scrambled off,
and struggled out of the water with some
difficulty. He was at once charged by
the police with having a horse not under
proper control, with riding on the foot-
path, wi th sendi ng a n animal into the water,
with bathing in the Serpentine during
prohibited hours, and with other breaches
of the Park regulations. As he explained,
however, that the animal was a riverhorse,
and therefore ought to be in the river,
and that he had not bathed in the
Serpentine but had only stepped in with
his clothes on by mistake, his name and
address were taken and he was allowed to
go home. The Royal Humane Society's
men, after two hours of fruitless efforts,
desisted from their attempts to rescue
the hippopotamus, which left the water
later on and trotted quietly home to
Mr. Jamrach'S stable. H. D. B.

Infuriated C. 0. 10th V. B. Mutlfordshire Fusiliers {who has ordered Bugler to sound the "Ceasi fire' several times without effect).

"WHAT 'S THE ODDS AS LONG AS YOU 'RE 'JAPPY'!"
In -what, light do the educated Japanese, the Jap gentlemen
and ladies, regard such a performance as the one we have
recently been witnessing at the Criterion Theatre? It seemed
to bear a striking resemblance to the inspired attempts of very
small and early masters, joining with their sisters and with
young friends of about the same age, in treating their nurses
and, perhaps, even papa and mamma (admission to principal
places at the price of " what you like to give, thank ye, Sir ! ")
to a dramatic entertainment in the Theatre Royal Day Nursery.
Of course, these modern Jap actors gave us dramas which might
be termed "scenes from old Japan " in no way representing
modern Japanese life. The story was made quite intelligible
by their action, and their speaking was as the twittering of
early birds on a spring morning, only given pianissimo.
In The Sliogun (not unlike the title of Irish drama The
Shaughraun) the love-making of Madame Sada YAOCO and Mr.
Fuiisawa was, especially on the lady's part, sweetly natural;
while the death per "Happy Despatch" and subsequent, or
was it simultaneous, beheading of Vjitomo (Mr. Hattori), and
of the little Jappy child Haruo, delightfully played by Master
Raikichi, quite a mere "toddle," brought tears to the eyes of
those most inclined to laugh at the whole show. As that
wicked old Sybarite of a Shogun (which is apparently Japanese
for "a Great Gun"), with his leering eyes and amorous grin,
Mr. O. Kawakami was really admirable. You didn't want to
hear what he said; his manner and action showed to the most
limited imaginative capacity of what that naughty old man was
thinking. Ought to have been ashamed of himself!
It must have occurred to some among the titteringand giggling
audience to ask themselves how Sir Henry IRVING, were he
playing (say) Coriolanus or Macbeth at the Theatre Royal,
Li Seyum, in Yokohama, to a fashionable Japanese audience,
would like it were his finest efforts and most desperately tragic
fighting and dying greeted with uncontrollable merriment?
Yet this is how the audience received all the combats, the
stranglings, the knivings, and, indeed, all the terribly tragic
situations on the night when I saw it, and, I admit, thought it,
with an exception here and there, elementary and childish.
There was very little art used to conceal art. It was, as it
were, a Japanese Bottom and his friends playing Pyramus and
Thisbe before the Court of Theseus, with a charming young
lady, as Chorus, to step in front of curtain, before each act,
to smilingly explain the plot.
As an intermezzo La LOIH Fuller gave us a marvelious
exhibition of Drapery Dancing, viewed in all sorts of lights.
Some of the designs—one of the Rose and another of the Sun-
flower—are exquisite. It is wonderful, but not fairylike; it is
not a Peri at the Gates of Paradise, no, it is a Loie Fuller's
earthly form of entertainment, as difficult to classify as is " L\
Loie" herself, the moving, materialised spirit of a show which
may be described as fascinating and irritating.
The Japs have departed on tour. May their Shogun achieve
its aim and make a hit.

IDYLLS OF THE CHIEF.
IV.
[Note.—The reader is requested to regard the word Chief in this connec-
tion as a general term applicable to the leader of the Liberal Party for the
time being; and the following Idyll as continuing a series originally
entitled "Morte d'Sarcoirt."]
So on an afternoon the knighthood drew
Mist-like to that great Meeting in the Mall.
For he, Sir Belchamp Porte-drapeau, the Chief,—
Chief? Ay, for if to have the style of Chief
Is to be Chief indeed then ho was Chief,
Which thing he thought to settle once for all—
Being vexed of soul because his flower of men
Had fed, or meant to feed, beyond their strength,
And, feeding, spoken, or proposed to speak
Most parlously above the wassail-bowl,
Oblivious of their fealty to the Cause,
Oblivious of their own elected lord,
Oblivious of all else beside the facts,
And sown divisions, yea, and deadly taint
Among the weaker vessels—he, the Chief,
Summoned a solemn conclave, to be held
Without refreshments. So the knighthood came
All through the solstice-sultry afternoon
Panting; and filled the Order's ancient haunts
(Half-alien now, and borrowed free of charge)
And tasted vain desire of cooling drinks;
Factions, a few, but loyal-seeming all,
And smiling widely, as the Cheshire cat
Smiles in the picture. Then Sir Porte-drapeau
Clomb to the chair, and heavily sighing spake.
"Not for myself, O knighthood, would I plead,
Seeing I care not greatly, no, not I,
For that white light that beats upon a crown
Sadly debased and shorn of privilege,
Being hawked about and ever changing heads;
But—for the heathen wanton overmuch,
Accounting us a beast of many mouths,
Each feeding at its several banquet-board—
I would remind this Table Round, so-called,
How they reposed their hands in mine and swore,
Not lightly, but with strange and fearful oaths,
To love one Chief alone, and freeze to him
Through years of Opposition till he came
Out on the top and triumphed. So ye swore,
Saying "We will," and straightly did it not.
WThat cause of privy malice wrought this wrong,
Being so innocent I may not guess,
Or, shrewdly guessing, will not seem to guess,
So ye be minded now to make amends.
For, O my knights, some faith there needs must be,
Wide-armed and tolerant, which being embraced,
"We might contrive to pass our days in peace;
And such an one I will proceed to sketch.
And, first, ignoring bow the thing began,
I would pursue this war and make an end;
Yet not by military means, O no,
But civil; and for those misguided men,
British, that lifted reckless hands and struck
At Britain's throne, I would o'erlook their fault,
And yield, for blows, the kiss of courtesy,
Leaving to loyalty its own reward,
That all may so be equal at the last.
This, not to bandy words, should be a creed
Wide-armed and tolerant, with easy range
For honest difference on paltry points,
Which for the time escape me; yet I hold
That we should draw the line at lawless cliques,
Dining or other. Having said this much,
I call upon a brace of gallant men
To move a vote of confidence in me."
He ended; then those others, worthy knights,
Spake ; and Sir Harcourt, he that ruled the lists,
But sold his charger, having had enough,
And made as if to pass, but, being bored
In Avalon the Forest, made return
In that balloon of which the tale was told *;
And gladly would have led the jousts again
But dared not say so,—he, Sir Harcourt, spake
Softly, with delicate motion of his chins,
Veiling his heart; and all the Order cried,
(For so the theme of dinners held their thoughts)
"Clash crockery! and clang glass! Let the Chief
reign!"
Thereat Sir Fife, the same that knew his mind
And had a way of putting it in words
Most awkward, and was deemed the primal root
Of this disturbance, rose and roundly swore
Loyalty to the death, with leave reserved
To hold what damned heresy he chose.
Wliereon the cheerful Order cried again,
"Clash crockery! and clang glass 1 Let the Chief
reign!"
But he, Sir Reid de Cardiff, who alone
Of all the greater knighthood had his tongue
Elsewhere than in his cheek, stood forth and said,
"A boon, my liege lord! Let me hear again
What are those comfortable words of grace
Proffered to rebels taken in the toils
With blood of loyal British on their hands!"
So he, and sat at pause, waiting reply.
And in the pause Sir Gris du Jeu DE Paume
Chipped hastily in, and said, " Let details be 1
This is no place for aught but platitude
Clothed in loose verbiage, cryptic, vaporous,
Committing nobody, me least of all.
Who in this frequence am resolved to swear
Loyalty to the death, but, once outside,
Reserve with bold Sir Fife my manhood's claim
To hold what damned heresy I choose!"
Then on Sir Reid the knighthood looked askance
As on a dreadful child that fain would know
More than he should; and crossed themselves, and
cried,
"Clash crockery! and clang glass I Let the Chief
reign!"
But when Sir Belchamp Porte-drapeau, that shone
Like to a sepulchre now-washed without,
Had made acknowledgment of favours done,
Dropping no hint of banquets yet to be,
But loudly praising liberty of speech,
So it be always barren of results,—
Thereafter, overworn •with ecstasy,
The knighthood parted, each to his owd place,
Save such as went and told it to the Press.
And, last, Sir Laboix'HERE DE Boom-LE-Vrai
Low-muttering in his beard remarked, "What rot!"
And I that called myself their King of Fools!
And now, behold! I am a beaten man!" O. S.

A MEDICINAL MARRIAGE;
Or, Prevention re Sometimes Better
than Matrimony.
[" One remedy against indigestion is matrimony.
At least, the Lancet tells us that it is the celibate
young barrister, the lonely curate in lodgings, the
struggling bachelor journalist, or business man
or clerk who suffers most from premature' dyspepsia
because he eats alone. He generally reads during
his meals, which is bad; or he reads directly he has
bolted his food, which is likewise bad. Obviously,
therefore, matrimony is a bar to indigestion."—
Lady's Pictorial.]
THERE was an air of triumph about Mrs.
Chat a way that was not usual. She floated
across the room buoyed up by some moral
superiority. Her husband eyed her sus-
piciously. Her smile of welcome, he
remembered thinking, was a little over-
done this evening. Her conversation at
tlie dinner-table had been sustained in a
manner that denoted a deep purpose.
Chataway lit his cigar and settled him-
self in an arm-chair. Mrs. Chataway
gave a little laugh.
"I often wonder," she said, evidently
in imitation of a man's brusque tones,
"why you married a girl like me."
"Why I married you?" he repeated,
vaguely.
"Yes," she assented.
"Oh—er—love at first sight, darling.
I couldn't help myself."
The young wife gave a second little
laugh full of delightful incredulity, and
looked her husband full in the face to
accentuate her entire disbelief of the
statement.
This completely upset Chataway.
"Of course, it's awfully difficult to
explain"
"I was afraid you would find it so."
"Why, Nina, what do you mean"
"I mean," and she stood up, and flashed
a pair of pretty searching eyes on her
recalcitrant spouse, "that for two years
I have lived in a fool's paradise. That for
two years I have been fettered to a man
in whom I trusted and believed, only to
And at the end of it that I have been
tricked, swindled into an ignominious and
loveless marriage."
Chataway' gazed in mute wonder.
"Praise my good looks now. My hair,
my taste in gowns, my housekeeping, my
thousand and one womanly charms in your
simpering phrases of adulation, which a
cruel deception has taught you to handle
with such deftness. And see the poor
weak flsh nibble at the baits. Tell me all
over again how you fell in love with the
swing of my shoulders, the poise of my
bead, my half-parted lips when I drank in
your decontly-veiled protestations of love
and sympathy. Paugh! Thank heaven
my eyos are opened. The flsh has seen
the hook treacherously concealed in the
red worsted."
The man lot his hands fall into his lap.
Somehow or other she had discovered the
motive that had urged him to make her his
wife. And yet, how?
"My dear Nina," he began again.
"Toll me again," she said, with a sneer
that dried up all the blood in the man's
heart, "how you despise the man who
marries for any but the purest emotions
of ideal love; generous, manly sentiments,
true nobility of thought!"
The man was cowed. He could not
stand up against this whirlwind of denun-
ciation. He was ashamed, crushed,
humiliated. Still, he was a roan; so he
attempted to brazen it out.
"Nina," he attempted, "this is the
sheerest nonsense ''
The woman gurgled inarticulately.
"What right have you to ?" The
man's jaw dropped. For, with a quick
movement his wife took from her bodice a
small crumpled note and flung it towards
him. He turned ashy pale. He recognised
in the toll-tale shred of paper a congratu-
lation from an old friend on h'is marriage.
With a sickly feeling he took it; his
tremulous fingers smoothed out the letter,
and he read:—"I cuuhl not think why
the deuce you married the girl, until I re-
membered you are a martyr to indigestion.
I hope sincerely the curexvill be effectual."
The paper fluttered to the ground.
"And this is the end of a high
romance," said she, brokenly; "to find
oneself the victim of a medicinal marriage,
a cure for dyspepsia, a dose, a mere dose.
All that is best, and tenderest and most
beautiful in womanhood compounded by a
pharmaceutical brute of a man into a
matrimonial tabloid. It 'stoo humiliating
—too degrading I"
It was hard, after having taken the
medicine steadily for two years, to find at
the end of it that it violently disagreed
wthhim. W. H. M.

OCCASIONAL OPERATIC NOTES.
Thursday, July 11.—On no account, even at a banker's—(well,
that's as may be),—would Mr. Punch's Royal Opera Commissioner
miss hearing and seeing his very dear old friend Lea Huguenots.
To-night his old friend shows him a new face, namely, that of
M. Jerome appearing as Ruoul de Nangis, or as near Raoul de
Nangis as possible. And M. Jerome was distinctly good; not
great, not entrancing, no; not making us wonder that the sweet
singing, merry, yet stately equestrian, Queen Susan Adams oj
Navarre, did not fall in love with him on the spot and cut out her
first lady-in-waiting Valentine, powerfully played by Miss
Lcciennk Breval, but a very capable and agile Raoul for all that.
M. Planqon realises the grand seigneur, as the Comte de St.
Bris, singing perfectly and acting as he always does, artisti-
cally. Whatever character M. Planijon for the moment repre-
sents, that for the moment he is. M. Declery tres distingue as
the high-minded Comte de Nevers. M. JOURNET is not the
rough-and-ready Huguenot soldier Marcel, his " Piff Paff " song
having in it less of the musket than the pop-gun, rather missed
fire. After the great duet, between Marcel and Valentine in
the third act, e'est Mademoiselle Lucienne Breval gu'tl jioks
/aut when we applaud with all hands, but an encore could not
be taken. Mile. Maubouro as Urbain, the page, delightful,
both in singing and acting, though her "No, No, No!" was
not so effective as to make it at once apparent that she is
"thoroughly in the 'No.'"
'Tis a wonderful Opera! What chances for singer and
actor 1 What triumphs for stage-manager and for scenic
artists 1 Yet the chorus that should be throughout so spirited
is but half-hearted, and its shyness was apparent when as
Huguenot soldiers they tried to back up their officer in his
solos, they themselves having, contrary to all military discipline,
taken the initiative by commencing the Rataplan chorus. What
tact is demanded of any stage-manager to render such a situation
anything like possible! Les Huguenots requires new stage
management, fearlessly ignoring conventionality.
Dare a conductor, who should be equally musician and
dramatist, with a thorough knowledge of the most advanced
requirements, re-write some of the old '' tum-ti-tum'' accompani-
ments? Would not MEYERBEER himself have done so in 1901?
Not a doubt of it. If, for modern audiences, to edit and adapt
Shaesfbare is permissible, why not do the same with Meyer-
beer? And so with the old stage operatic traditions. Look at
that absurd "banquet" in the first scene, when some
hundred splendidly attired guests drink aerated nothing out of
shining goblets, apparently quite charmed at having been
invited, the whole lot of them, to a tasty " spread," consisting
of one centre-dish containing a couple of apples, a pair of
oranges, grapes, I think, and, possibly, nuts, lavishly provided
for them by the generous giver of the feast, the gay and festive
Comte de Nevcrs. The polite guests did not touch that single
dish of fruit. They knew those apples and oranges. A little
child sitting behind me in the stalls watched this scene with
the greatest possible interest. "Why," she asked her mamma,
"does no one take any of the apples?" Her mamma could
only say " Hush!" And how delighted was the little girl when,
at the close of the act, Raoul de Nangis had a handkerchief
bound over his eyes. "Oh, mamma I " she exclaimed joyously,
"now they 're going to play Blind Man's Buff!" Poor little
girl! how disappointed she was when the curtain descended,
and all chance of seeing a really good parlour game of "Blind
Man's Buff" was lost for ever.
The season terminates on Monday, July 29, and for Wednes-
day, July 17, a new opera, Le Roi d'Ys, by Edouard Lalo, is
announced. What will be the next novelty? La Reine de
Wherefores, as a companion Opera?
OUB BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Millionaire Mystery (Chatto & Windus) belongs to the
class of story-telling that in theatrical illustration was known
as "penny plain, tuppence coloured." To do Mr. Fergcs
Hume justice, his book should, in recognition of the wealth and
elaboration of its detail, rank on the higher pecuniary scale.
Never before was there such concatenation of circumstance,
the unexpected ever leading to the improbable. If there is in
any locality a desire to make the flesh creep, probably not an
unpleasant process in sultry weather, The Millionaire Mystery
is the very thing.
Sister Theresa, by GEORGE Moorb (T. Fisher Ukwin), is a
sequel to the same author's Evelyn Innes. To understand Sister
Theresa it is essential to re-read certain portions of the earlier
work, published in 1898. It is safe to affirm that neither story was
intended by the author to be read virginibus puerisque. More-
over, virgines et pueri of healthy literary tastes would, it is the
Baron's deliberate opinion, be weary of the first book after
a few chapters, and therefore would never think of attempt-
ing the second novel; while, if they began with this recently
published sequel, it would be unintelligible to them. Primarily,
Wagner and his music seem to be responsible for much that
was wrong in the life of Evelyn Innes who became Sister Theresa.
The story, powerfully told, in clear and graceful style, is
saddening in its realism, dealing as it does with the wanderings of
a restlessly yearning soul in perpetual conflict with its material
body. Not a very novel theme; and whether the ultimate victory
is with grace or with nature the author leaves undecided;
and the heroine's career seems so uncertain, that the reader
almost expects to see the notice, "to be continued in my
next " on the last page of Sister Theresa. At all events Sister
Theresa is not dead yet, and perhaps there is Moore hereafter
on the same subject. Mr. George Moore, after the manner of
the Zolaesque school, has no scruples as to "dotting his 'i's'";
indeed, the Baron is of opinion that,with hardly an exception,these
dots are simply blots. Could not the story have been rendered
attractive to all, and profitable to many, without these blots of
dots? As it is, the undoubtedly clever work of a clever man
can only be recommended to the elect few who will thoroughly
appreciate the artistic merit of this author's latest work.
Mr. Raphael Tuck has sent for the Baron's inspection and,
he hopes, approval, an assortment of post-cards with photographs
of various places of holiday resort and of picturesque types pecu-
liar to some of them. Good, so far. But picture occupies so
much of the card that little space is left for sending a
friendly message and signing each. Now, when Mr. Raphael
tuck it into his head to produce these cards he evidently forgot

use of anyone sending a portrait of a " Deep Sea Fisherman" to

And without "lines" the fisherman at any time is useless? Of

meaning, then wo mustn't judge by tho surface, but must sup-
pose the photo to mysteriously convey some "fishing interro-

FOR A CONSIDERATION.
Dear Mr. Punch,—No doubt, until June next, the columns of
your contemporaries will be deluged with suggestions as to the
route of the Coronation Procession. Permit me to make a pro-
posal in the same direction?
Why should not the route be as follows? Start from Bucking-
ham Palace and do the suburbs thoroughly. Up to Chiswick by
Kensington, Hammersmith, and Upham Park Road. Then have
detachments sent to Streatham, Tooting, Peckham Rye, Lewis-
ham, and Barnes. I say detachments, because the main portion
would be required for parading Lesser London and the City.
With a little organisation all the principal streets could be
visited. Even the provinces might share, to a certain extent,
in the demonstration. The heralds, acting on precedent, might
make a visitation to a few of our watering-places.
If my plan is adopted—as it should be—thousands and thou-
sands will be able to take part in an event of unique historical
importance, after, of course, showing their solvency by paying
for their places in advance. Yours sincerely,
An Anti-banger op Saxpences.
LAST NIGHTS AT THE LYCEUM.
Personally, I should be content were Sir Henry Irving to
limit himself to a single piece at any one performance. Of
course, when Shakspeare provides the entertainment there
can seldom be two pieces in the bill; but when Conan Doyle's
Waterloo is given, the impersonation of Corporal Gregory Brew-
ster takes as much out of the audience as it does out of the
actor, and most willingly would we quit the theatre immediately
after the fall of the curtain on the Corporal's death, grateful
for having seen it and absolutely certain that no other piece
could give us so much of the very essence of the great actor's
histrionic genius, rather than witness him exhausting himself
on the character of Mathias in The Bells, a play that could well
have tho programme to itself. By the way, the " melodrame"
music for this, except when it is purely Alsatian in character,
might with advantage bo rewritten.
But what Sir Henry might give as a foil to The Bells, or to
Waterloo, would be the slight piece entitled Jingle, of which I
remember nothing whatever except the principal character
figuring in a dramatised episode from Pickwick. Possibly it
would have to be re-written: a new version might, perhaps,
give us Jingle at Dingly Dell; Jingle eloping with Miss Wardle;
a cinematographic view of the postchaise chase bringing down
the curtain; and, for the second act, we should have the
touching meeting of Mr. Pickwick with Jingle in the Poor
Debtors' side of the Fleet, ending with his embarcation for
a new life in a new world. There would be much to raise a
smile: but the finish would leave us smiling through tears.
However, this is but a suggestion, that, adopted practically,
might relieve the actor who is inclined to over-tax his powers,
and, which might prove a very considerable attraction.
Now " The Dook has something to say " as to Waterloo and
its present cast, which, though efficient, is not quite up to the
original. However wonderful be the " make-up " of any actor,
yet "mannerism," like murder, "will out," and within a few

"Why was Bill Jones made Captain! 'E's done nothin', 'e
ain't."
"Nothin'I Oh, ain't 'eI! Wy, at the Hoval 'e ihrew up
THE BALL FROM FOUR BOUND'eY WOT GRACE 'IT!"
minutes of the best disguised actor's appearance on the scene,
his individuality is sure to reveal his identity. I am beginning
to reconsider this dictum: for it occurs to me, after seeing this
piece at the Lyceum, that there are two young actors on the
London stage who can perfectly conceal their identity; and.of
these two Mr. Laurence Irving is one; while as to the other
young actor, I leave experienced playgoers to guess, merely
saying that he is not, and never has been, connected in any
way with the Lyceum.
All who have seen Mr. Laurence Irving in the play of Robes-
pierre, for example, will testify to the perfection of his make-up
as Colonel James Midwinter, which was so excellent (though to
his reading of the part I take exception) that, unlike the amateur
in The Pantomime Rehearsal, I did not "know it was Laurence
Irving," nor did I make the discovery until consulting the bill
after leaving the theatre. Had his rendering of this small
part struck me as somethiug exceptional, naturally I should
at the time have referred to the bill to see if the name of the
actor were familiar to me.
For Friday, July 19, The Merchant is announced, and on
Saturday, July 20, Coriolanus is given on the last night of the
season, after which, and before starting for work again, let us
hope Sir Henry will give himself a thoroughly lazy, lounging,
invigorating, recuperating vacation; and if he doesn't, "a word
will have to be said on that subject by The Dook."

[July 17, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MACHINE, SOME MORTALS,
AND A BAT AND BALL.
There is no need to say much about the
Bowler. Like all latter-day trundlers he
was a person of next-to-no-importance,
with a strong fellow-feeling for Skating
Competitions and the Hay Crop and all
other unfortunates whose success or
failure depends on the whim of the
weather. Also, he was a cricket reformer
of the deepest dye. He was fond of
arguing that the g«ime ought to be played
in winter instead of in summer : we might
get decent wickets then, he said. Or else
why not use a smaller ball? But his
ideas, like his deliveries, were treated
with scanty respect by a sceptical public.
The Batsman deserves more notice. He
belonged to a well-known cricketing
family, easily distinguished by the fact
that its members never figure in the list
of averages. His own initials were B. R.,
and he was a son of M.'s and a brother of
8. M. and B. and T., as well as of A. N.,
who is, of course, the most famous of all
the others. His cousin, Anon, the most
prolific of the minor poets, was stretched
behind the net on what he called the
grassy sward, armed with a pencil and
note-book. There were also present the
Bat and the Ball.
The wicket was a good old-fashioned
one. In other words, as B. R. remarked
with some heat, it reduced first-class
cricket to an utter farce. But the Bowler,
for once in his life, was enjoying himself.
As hot and happy and sticky as a child at
a Sunday-school treat, he was giving B. R.
a very bad quarter of an hour. In the
language of the sporting newspapers he
was making the ball talk, and Anon, who
had never yet seen this feat accomplished,
except in print, composed himself to
listen with both ears, ventre-ii-terre.
"What's this new game called?"
asked the Bat, who was also in a conver-
sational mood.
"Called!" repeated the Ball, scorn-
fully. "I forget. Sort of name that
recalls the delicious hair-oils of thirty
years ago, combined with the patent
compressed soups of to-day. But it's the
new society game; I know that much.
Begins with Ft—that's the soup, and ends
with oro,—that's the olives, hair-oil,
I mean. But it's,—no, it isn't Vioro.
There's somethin'—can't remember what
it is—joinin' the two (got you that time,
old chap) halves."
"Yes," murmured the Bat, as he
knocked in the middle stump, "there
would be a joint, wouldn't there, after
the soup? Ah'm. Perhaps there's a G
missing. You 're always droppin' them
about. 1 know. It must be Vigoro—is that
it? Well, it certainly does make one's
hair curl. But how's it played?" he
continued, settling himself in the block.
"It's a sort of cricket, ain't it?"
"Cricket! It's about as much like
cricket as—as that is," exclaimed the
Ball, as B. R. put his pad in front of a
cunning off-break. "Why, they use lawn-
tennis balls instead of me."
"That won't make much difference here
I wish you wouldn't kick," said the Bat,
all in one breath. "That ain't cricket
anyhow. You needn't get savage. You've
hurt my man." Then there was an
interval, while the Bowler tried to look as
if he were sorry, and B. R. made forcible
remarks (which he ought to have sup-
pressed), about his thumb and the wicket.
And it certainly was bleeding—the thumb,
Wen enteniht, not the wicket.
"Well, go on, old stick-in-the-mud," the
Bat resumed, when the Man had at length
exhausted his vocabulary. "Tell us how
they bowl."
"With lawn-tennis rackets!"
"Bosh! How do they field, then?"
"With rackets."
"And catch?"
"With rackets—rotten badly."
"Ah," said the Bat, in a relieved tone
of voice, "then they're not out-and-out
Radicals. Not going to change every-
thing all at once. That means there's a
chance for me. At least—they 're not
going to cut me down, or stick up another
wicket, are they?"
"Worse than that,"—said the Ball.
"By Jove, I shot then, didn't I? I'd
quite forgotten what it feltlike. They 're
goin' to bat with"
"Not with rackets?"
The Ball nodded: his heart was too full
for words.
"Oh, what rot!" screamed the Bat.
At least that was what he meant to say.
What he did say—well, this is Anon's
account of the matter. The Bat, he says,
was obviously a highly respectable Bat,
rated Al at Lord's, and carefully trained
not to interfere with balls which the pads
could play as well or better than himself.
In fact, he had got beyond the mere A, B, C,
of cricket, and was learning to mind his
P's and Q's in first-class company. But
when he got excited he could not pro-
nounce his R's. As Anon remarked in his
humorous way, they always stumped him.
So that what ho actually did say in his
frenzy was not, " What rot," but "What
toot."
Now it happened that the young female
who goes by the name of Echo, was, after
her usual custom, slumbering lazily in
front of the Pavilion. You know her
trick of catching up your last word in a
scornful sort of way, giving it a perverse
twist, and rushing off at a tangent, with-
out paying any attention to the main
argument. This trait of hers would, of
itself, be enough to prove her sex, even if
the most famous of Anon'£ predecessors
had not settled the question for all time
by the immortal line, "Echo femininum
name." 11 is true that the writer adduces
no evidence in support of his proposition.
But, argues Anon, that only proves, not
that his gender-rule is at fault, but that
he was either a married man, or else had
sisters. And as ANON is tho one himself,
and possesses several of tho others, he is
probably correct.
But to resume. When the Bat cried,
"What rot!" he called so loudly that he
woke the nymph of the Pavilion. And
after that the conversation took the
following turn.
Echo. "What what?"
Ball. "Don't take any notice of her.
.She can't catch on to what I say. I'm
too fast for her."
Bat. "All right. Did you hear what
my man said when you hit him on the
wrist?"
Echo. " Whist!"
Ball. "Got your middle stump again,
old cock. You were frightfully crooked."
Bat. "Well, it's B. R.'s fault. Ho
ought to hold me straighter."
Eclio. "Waiter!"
Ball. "Jove, 1 bumped a bit then.
Beastly wicket."
Bat. "Yes, I don't half like it: it's too
risky."
Echo. "Whiskey."
Ball. "She's pullin' your leg, old
chap."
Bat. "If I could only pull hers!
Wouldn't it be rare"
Echo. "Beware!"
Bat. "Simply ripping I"
j Echo. "Whipping I"
Ball. "You couldn't."
Bat. " Could if I tried."
Echo. " Wide."
Ball. "I'm blowed if it—oh, I forgot."
Bar. "I say, that was a good smack.
How many could I have run?"
Echo. "One."
Ball. "Oh, confound the girl! Here,
let me have a shot at her. He's tossing
mc upslowernow. Are you[there, Echo?"
Echo. "Ecco."
Ball. "You are"
Echo. "You are"
Ball. "A fool."
Echo. "A/ooI."
Ball. "No, hang it, I must put it the
other way round. I mean I am a fool, you
fool."
Echo. "Fool, you fool."
Whether the Ball would have succeeded
in finding out Echo's weak spot, is, in
Anon's opinion, rather doubtful. But at
this moment the Mortals took up the run-
ning. "By George, B. R." said the
Bowler, as he put the Ball into his bag,
"didn't I make him talk?"
"You!" answered the Batsman. "It
was the wicket. Besides, balls don't
talk."
"This one does, my dear cousin,", said
Anon. "1 heard it."
"Heard it! Bosh! You beastly poets,
are always thinking you hear things.

A Study in Expression.
'Spose you '11 say next that my bat talks,
or my pads, or—or"
"Or the mowing-machine?" suggested
Anon, -who had some unpublished verses
on the subject in his pocket. "But it does.
Can't you hear what it's saying? Well,
I can. I '11 just scribble it down while
you fellows are changing. Oh, it's no
bother." And when the two cricketers
returned, bored but submissive, the poet
and his verselets were ready for them, as
fresh (apparently) as a basket of new-laid
eggs, and without a hint of the Rhyming
Dictionary or a trace of the midnight oil
about them.
"Sure you fellows don't mind?" he
began. "Well, then, I've called it Ex
Machina, and it begins like this: 'Back-
wards and forwards.' B' the bye, I
ought to tell you the first and last verses
are in italics. It's more usual, you know.
Ahem 1
EX MACHINA.
Backwards and forwards, and forwards
and back,
Marking the length of its double green
track,
Making the cricket-ground level and green,
This is the song of the Mowing-Machine.
Hark to me, cricketers, hark to my whirr,
Hark to my mellow machinery's purr,
Hark to my murmuring all the long day;
I have my work to do, you have your
play.
Work at your playing, then,—like a
machine,
Regular, little by little, and keen;
Nerves made of iron and sinews of steel,
Shoulder to shoulder, and wheel within
wheel.
Shoulder to shoulder, you '11 get at the
heart of it,
Wheel within wheel is the whole and the
part of it.
Play with one mind and ono end and one
aim,
Playing together and playing the game.
Play it with judgment and play it with
skill,
Play with good temper but play with a
will,
Play it with courtesy, play it with pluck,
Play it with something that's better than
luck.
If you'd be honest, steal nothing but
runs,
If you want wins, then take care of the
"ones,"
Don't count your centuries ere they are
hatched,
Don't drop your catches until they are
catched.
Play the game, aiming to make a good
fight of it,
Play—nevermind if you 're beaten in spite
of it; i
Keen in the contest and straight in the
strife,—
That is the motto for cricket and life.
Nearer and clearer the stir and the luhirr
of it,
Further and fainter the thrum and the hum
of it,
Backicards and forioards, now white and
now green,
That is the song of the Mowing-Machine.
"Not half-bad," said the Batsman, as
the Poet paused for breath and applause.
"Oh, ripping," added the Bowler; "but
I 'in afraid I must be off. You coming my
way, B. R.?"
"Clever little devil, that cousin of
yours," he went on, as soon as they were
out of earshot. "/ couldn't have done
it, at least not in record time like that."
"Oh, well, I don't know. Yes, I dare-
say," returned the Batsman, with cousinly
disparagement. "Pity he's such an ass
though. He's an absolute crock at games,
you know. And yet, somehow—I wonder
if he did hear all that rot. What d'you
think?" G. P. C.
"OUR DEAR OLD HOLMES."
"Is it really true that you rescued the
greats. H.?"
"Certainly I did. As the celebrated
detective descended with the utmost ex-
pedition from the mountain, I caught him
before he was smashed in the valley."
"Really! Most astounding!''
"I caught him in a balloon."
"Wonderful! What was it made of?"
"It was made of paper."
"Was it inflated with gas?"
"No. It was fed by a magazine."
"Of powder?"
"Ah, now you are asking too much."
"Then is even the name of the maga-
zine a secret?"
"Certainly—a journalistic secret."
And the Interviewer disappeared sing-
ing the old-time song " In the ' Strand.'"

46 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Jn« 17, 1901.

"FOE THEIR HEAETHS AND HOMES!"
An Appeal.
In the number dated November 8, 1890, Mr. Punch aroused
tho sympathy of all with a cartoon by Sir John Tenniel
entitled " Britannia Consolatrix." A crowd in the background
cheered the troops departing for the war (1899!!), and "the
girls they left behind them " were their wives and children, to
whom Britannia said, " I will take care of you! Your man has
gone to his duty—and I will do mine." Once again Mr. Punch
comes forward and craves your support, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Fathers and Mothers, for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families
Association, the Holborn and Finsbury Fund, under the
presidency of Her Majesty Queen Alexandra. In this cause,
the great cause of charity, we, whatever may be our political
opinions regarding the war, all must be, and, for the matter of
that, are, united. From prospectus recently issued, it appears—
"The wife of a Private receives a total of 9s. lid. a week—of
this 7s. 7d. is separation allowance from Government, 2s. id.
allotment from her husband. She also receives Is. 2d. a week
for each child from Government.
'' The Association supplements this aid by small weekly grants.
In the Division of Holborn and Finsbury these vary from 2s. 6d.
to 5s. for each -woman.
"In cases -where employers make weekly grants, the Associa-
tion gives no help.
"The question of the moment is — whether these soldiers'
families are now to be left without this supplementary aid, or
whether the generosity of those in the Holborn and Finsbury
Boroughs will enable the Association to continue tlieir aid to
the wives of those men who, month after month, are so nobly
doing their duty.
"There have been altogether 566 families in the district. Of
these some, owing to tho death of tho husband, have become
entitled to pensions; some men have returned and resumed
their previous employment, while others, pending their dis-
charge, have been provided for from other sources. There are
still, however, 250 families to bo aided, at a cost of about £50
per week. The number gradually diminishes as the events just
mentioned occur, but it is estimated that funds will be required
to carry on the work for many, many months to come; further,
the recent despatch of fresh Militia battalions to the front has
added to the number of families.
"It is proposed to make arrangements whereby the smallest
weekly sums can be collected, enabling all to give to this Fund.
"All money received will be spent entirely on the families in
Holborn and Finsbury."
To this Mr. Punch need add nothing, except what he trusts
his many friends will join him in, namely, a substantial contribu-
tion, which can be addressed to The Punch Office, care of Messrs.
Bradbury, Agnew & Co., 10, Bouverie Street, E.G., for the
"Soldiers' and Sailors' Families (Holborn and Finsbury) Fund."
Mr. Punch receives many uninvited "contributions" which
from time to time he is compelled to reject, but such contribu-
tions as he now invites, being intended for the above-men-
tioned Fund, no matter what their value, will be immediately
and gratefully accepted, with heartiest thanks in behalf of
this truly "Home Charity." Friendly amateurs, too, send
him drawings which ho is unable to use, but in this case,
every chequo duly drawn and signed, by amateur or pro-
fessional, no matter how many figures there may be in it, will
be sure of acceptance, and will be handed over for artistic
"reproduction" in the shape of substantial benefit to the
families of our Soldiers and Sailors. Punch.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from the Diary of Toby M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 8.—
Extremely painful scene in the House
to-night. At half-past seven Lord Chan-
cellor, rising from "Woolsack, regarding

Canny Kilmarnock.
(Colonel D-nny.)
with awful countenance the bench of
Bishops, remarked, "I have a strong con-
viction that we have been out of order
since half-past five."
Now it was about that hour, be the same
more or less, that the Archbishop of
Canterbury interposed on Motion relating
to King's Declaration on Accession.
Subject came before House on stage of
consideration of Report of Select Com-
mittee. Calling on the Order, Lord
Chancellor observed that all that might
be done at present juncture was to lay
Report on the Table, whereupon notice of
action might be given. Hopped back to
Woolsack; resumed his seat; folded his
gown across his stately body with assur-
ance that the thing was settled.
Up gat the Primate, and positively
moved that Report be referred back to
Committee I A hush of fearsome expecta-
tion fell over Assembly. What would
happen 1 Would the floor open, creating
a vacancy in the See of Canterbury?
Instinctively felt that the Markiss was
the only man who might ride on the
brooding whirlwind. Markiss not one to
shirk his duty, especially when it involves
privilege of having a go at a Bishop.
The Primate complained that the Com-
mittee appointed to consider the delicate
matter did not contain a single Bishop.
Let a certain number be added to the
Committee, and the Report referred back.
In tones of mingled scorn and indigna-
tion the Markiss protested he had never
heard of such a thing as referring back a
Report to a Committee without indicating
particulars on which it was desired to
amend it. The only suggestion offered by
the most reverend prelate was that to the
Committee should bo added "a large
infusion of Bishops."
Most eloquent word "infusion" in the
Markiss's mouth. Analogy between
Bishops and tea - leaves unmistakable.
Speaking again later, when revolt seemed
coming to a head, he changed the metaphor,
alluding with increased scorn to a pro-
posal to "dilute the Committee with two
Bishops." This tamed even the truculent
Temi>LE; broke down the whito «walls of
resistance, four-deep, set up above gang-
way to right of Woolsack. No one could
say whither the fancy of the Markiss
would lead him next. There were possible
similitudes even worse than tea-leaves
and tepid water. Primate made haste to
capitulate, humbly asking leave to with-
draw his motion.
It was then the Lord Chancellor rose
in his might and rounded off a pleasant
evening by asserting that, led astray from
the Episcopal Bench, the House had for
two hours been in a disorderly state.
Business done.—Second Reading of Edu-
cation Bill moved in the Commons.
House of Commons, Tuesday night.—
"Sir," said the Squire of Malwood,
looking more than ever like Jove, "this
insolent injustice must be repelled."
As he thundered forth the words he,
swinging round on heel to face the
cheering Opposition, flung forth his right
arm as if discharging a thunderbolt.
What was the matter? Looking on and
listening, the stranger in the Gallery, un-
familiar with the Squire's occasional
manner, would be inclined to answer
with Mrs. Malaprop in The Rivals, " Why,

'■Danger! Weir!"
murder's the matter. Slaughter's the
matter. Killing's the matter."
It wasn't any one of the three.
John O'Gorst was the matter. On mov-
ing Second Reading of Education Bill
last night, he spoke disrespectfully of
School Boards. Having gone so far, he
naturally felt he might fling to the winds
last vestige of respectability; accordingly
assumed a sprightly air; told the House
some interesting stories.

North Birmingham.
(Mr. M-ddl-awe.)
It seems that, like Haroun-al-Raschid,
the Yice-President of the Council, dis-
guising himself and painting his well-
known bicycle a less obtrusive colour,
made the round of the night schools with
intent to see for himself how things were
working. In one he found the youthful
aspirants after knowledge tripping it on
the light fantastic toe. "Physical exer-
cise," it was discreetly called in the School
Report. The Yice-President was able to
testify that it was nothing other than the
giddy waltz, the shameless schottische.
Whether, in order the bettor to main-
tain his anonymity, the Yice-President of
the Council took a turn himself was not
stated. BRYCE, alluding to the adven-
ture, hinted belief that the right hon.
Gentleman was quite equal to the indis-
cretion. It is only fair to suppose he
drew the line at the waltz. But it is a
pretty conceit that flashes on the mind—
John O'Gorst, mated with a maiden from
Bethnal Green, going hands across and
up the middle, after the manner of
Mr. Fezziwig in John Leech's immortal
picture of the ball, in "A Christmas
Carol."
To-night, whilst Squire of Malwood
thundered at him across the Table and
Prince Arthur gallantly defended him,
John O'Gorst, with elbow supported in
palm of left hand, toyed with his beard,

and, ■with far-away look appropriate to
subject, reflected on the power and
majesty of the Committee of Council, on
tho grip, gentle, firm, and comprehensive,
hold on the Education Question by " my
noble friend the President."
Business done.—Education Bill read a
second time by 333 votes against 215.
Thursday night. — There is something
really distressing about Mr. Coghill'S
conscience. Its occasionally sudden
prompting enriches the Commons with
painfully close realisation of the hovering
habit of Banguo's ghost. To-day, as in
Macbeth's castle at Inverness, things are
going on quietly; no one thinking either
of Banquo or Mr. COGHILL; suddenly,
according to stage direction, "enter the
ghost of Banquo and sits in Macbeth's
place."
Came about this way. Lambert asked
when Agricultural Rating Bill will be
brought on. "Next week," Prince
Arthur answered, and resumed his seat,
thinking the incident closed. Prom be-
low gangway on Ministerial side was
heard a voice curiously like Banquo's be-
fore he became a ghost.
"Will the right honour able gentleman,"
it said, "wait until the war in South
Africa comes to an end before he proposes
to renew the Act?"
Storm of cheering rose from Opposition
benches ; here was a man on Ministerial
side saying what they long had thought!
Prince Arthur looking round beheld, not
Banquo, but Mr. COGHILL regarding him
with sternly-set face. For moment the
illusion was complete. The Prince's
white lips, slowly moving, murmured,
"Thou canst not say I did it; never shake
Thy gory locks at me."
Perceiving his mistake (the Member for
Stoke's hair is not red), recognising that
it was "only Coghill," Prince Abthur
recovered his self-possession. But these
things are disconcerting, especially in
hot weather. Worst of it is, never know
when similar thing may not happen. It's
always in quiet moments, on unexpected
topics, when no one is thinking of him,
that Cog HILL jumps up and puts incon-
venient questions of this kind.
Business done.—Report stage of Budget
Bill.
House of Lords, Friday.—Listening to
Llandaff discoursing on the King's
Declaration, observing James of Here-
ford seated on the Ministerial bench just
below him, memory carries the Member
FOR Sark back over a period, of thirty-five
years when he first knew Henry Matthews
and Henry James. It was in an ancient
assize town on the Oxford Circuit known
to Shakspeare. They were then in the
very prime of life and power, hardy
stuff-gownsmen. Their style with judge
and jury varied. Both were brilliant,
though possibly neither, constitutionally
modest, dreamt of this evening when they
would be sitting in the House of Lords,
ono having having been Homo Secretary
and Cabinet Minister, the other enjoying
the perhaps unique distinction of having
refused aliko the Speakership of the
House of Commons and the Lord High
Chancellorship.
As a debater Henry Matthews was,
strange to say, by no means a success
in the Commons. His speech on the
King's Declaration was one of the finest
pieces of oratory Sark has lately heard
in the Lords. In style and manner of
delivery it recalled Rathmore, and praise
can no higher go. Like the ever-lamented
David Plunket of the House of Commons,
Lord Llandaff very rarely speaks since
his translation. Which, seeing what is
suffered in the ordinary way in the House
of Lords, approaches inhumanity.
Business done.—Fifteenth allotted day
for Committee of Supply in the House of
Commons. Only eight more possible, and
still over a hundred votes out of 144 to
be dealt with.

I dreamed; and in my trance beheld
A gentleman infirm and eld,
Yet with a step heroic.
And by the glimmering lanthorn he
Upheld, I made him out to be
Diogenes, the stoic.
"Ah, sage," I cried, "still, still you
seek
An honest mortal!" Down his cheek
An idle tear-drop ran,
As he replied, "Fool, naught I care
A finger-snap whether, or where
There dwells an honest man.
"New centuries new wonders bring,
Which set new sages wondering
And new pursuits impose.
No more the phantom-man whose brow
Is stamped with honour I allow
To lead me by the nose 1 ''
"But still you seek with lanthorn,
why?"
I asked. And as he made reply
His voice with anguish shook.
"My search as hopeless as of yore
Now seems since I am searching for
A perfect English cook !''
Starvation Policy and Liberal Fare.—
At the Eighty Club's "At Home" Lord
Tyveedmolth suggested the abandonment
of the "Asquith Dinner," and added, ac-
cording to a Daily News note, that the
party " should postpone dining until they
could all dine together." Poor Party!
How ravenous they will all be when that
tout ensemble banquet comes off! Then,
indeed, will the Dinner Party cry be,

CORRUPTIO OPTIMI?
[" The trial took place on July 8, of Kapvscha,
one of the leading members of the Boer Committee
in Vienna, who got up a violent agitation in
favour of the Boers there and collected large sums
in order to present Mr. Kbvoeb with a costly
casket and other gifts. He engaged a large num-
ber of persons to accompany him in a tour of
Europe, demanding from each security in sums
amounting altogether to 40,000 crowns. The
address to Mr. Ksvoee was signed by 16,000
persons Kapvscha was arrested on sus-
picion of having appropriated the deposit money.
.... He has been sentenced to five years' hard
labour."—Daily Chronicle.]
Kapuscha speaks :—
I WAS among the leading men
Who formed Vienna's Boer Commit-
And strove to rouse with voice and
pen
The slumbering conscience of that
city.
Our efforts won complete success,
We made a splendid agitation,
We drew up a superb Address
To Mr. Kruger from the nation.
The document was widely read,
In every household you could find
it;
I don't remember what it said,
But sixteen thousand people signed it.
These signatures we hoped to send
To Krugf.R, in a costly casket,
And piles of money to that end
Came in when we began to ask it.
A tour through Europe's chiefest
towns
To help The Cause was next pro-
jected,
And more than forty thousand crowns
Were very rapidly collected.
The scheme delighted high and low,
We put it into execution,
And every one who wished to go
Forked out a handsome contribu-
tion.
And thus a good, round sum was
raised,
Tho total, really, was surprising,
I was, myself, immensely praised
For my success in organising.
But when, at length, tho moment came
To buy the casket and present it,
And cash was wanted for the same,
I had to own that I had spent it 1
So the projected tour fell through
As 1 had collared all the money.
It seemed the only thing to do,
Though Kruger must have thought it
funny.
And now Vienna's ceased to take
An interest in the Boer faction,
So no one but myself will make
A penny out of the transaction 1

[July 17, 1801.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A GOUTY COURTSHIP.
Her Dust.
July 16th.—Oh Joy! Joy!! Joy!!! Dear, darling diary, wo
have been introduced! Sweet Mrs. Denton, whose visit hung
over me like a nightmare, was the officiating angel. She knows
him very well; she says he is of verij good family, tolerably
well oft, rather a mala.de imaginaire she fancied, and ho has no
parents. "What could be nicer? He certainly improves even in
appearance when you talk to him. His features light up, and his
sad eyes almost sparkled once or twice. I am afraid he is not
very truthful. He told me that he had had an accident to his
knee, and the caissiere of the hotel distinctly told Mamma that
he was following the treatment for gout. But he does not like
to talk about himself. He asked me so many questions about
the things I liked and the sort of life I led, and it is extra-
ordinary that we agreed on every subject. We have exactly
the same tastes. He does not care much about society, and not
at all for dancing—no more do I. He likes golf and all out-door
sports. So do I. Oh! I wish it was to-morrow!
His Diary.
July 17th.—A terrible thing has happened. They are going
away very shortly. Some idiotic doctor has decided that Mr.
Somerville has had sufficient baths, and they have decided to
leave on the 22nd. I shall decide for myself when I have had
sufficient baths. It will probably be not later than the 23rd.
I am certainly better. Boyat is a wonderful place. The air
is perfectly delicious, and the Park so green and smiling with
its perennial orchestra. How could one be dull here? I sat
with her twice yesterday—she can tell fortunes by palmistry.
I begged her to tell mine. At first she objected, and asked me
if my fortune was not already told; but as I persisted she took
the tips of my Angers in hers and read some really wonderful
truths. It was an ecstatic moment. First of all, she said I
had "a very good heart "—(Quite true); that I had more heart
than "head"—(I am not quite sure of this); 1 had natural
gifts for the Arts—(I suppose this is true also); I had a good
temper—(This I know to be an absolute fact); I was perhaps
not always quite truthful—(Who can be in a world full of shams
and deceit?). Finally, I should live to a good old age, and she
added, rather maliciously, 1 thought, "notwithstanding the
accident to your knee." I couldn't help asking her, in rather a
shaky voice, "Shall I ever marry?" She looked very steadily
at the lines of my hand, and then said, "I hope so. People are
happier married, are they not?" I felt almost like making her
a declaration on the spot, but the band was playing a particu-
larly loud selection from Lohengrin, and the moment was not
propitious. I should like to have asked some more questions;
but her father came back from the fountain, where the waters
had evidently not improved his temper. "Do leave off that
tomfoolery, Maud," he said. "A hundred years ago you would
have been burnt as a witch." "It is a very harmless kind of
witchcraft," I said apologetically. "I don't choose my daughter
to do it, Sir," he said with a gouty glare.
Naturally, we both collapsed.
In the evening I managed to say: "Will you complete my
fortune to-morrow?" "I don't think I have anything to do
with your fortune," she answered simply. "You might have,
if you liked—if you would condescend," I said very humbly,
and then of course there came the usual interruption in the
shape of her mother. I am thinking of nice things to say
to-morrow. Usually, I don't find it difficult to talk, but when
I am with her I find myself tongue-tied or making inexpressibly
idiotic remarks.
Her Diary.
July 17th.—I have only four more days to spend here. A
week ago 1 should bo delighted at the prospect of leaving, but
now I am almost miserable. 1 suppose we shall meet again, but
everything is so uncertain in this life. I told his fortune by
palmistry yesterday. He has nothing but good lines in his hand.
I was sure of it before I looked. His " heart " is immense, and
he is affectionate and true in love; but I couldn't tell him all
that. I went very far as it was! He talks brilliantly, and at
the same time very sensibly. I could listen to him all day.
There is just a little sadness in some of the things he said, but
I don't know if that is caused by the past or the present. I
rather fancy it is the latter. Mamma likes him, but Papa says
there must be something radically wrong with a man who has
gout at his age. "God knows what he has been up to!" he
said. I turned crimson, and said: "Were you very wicked,
Papa, that you are being punished by gout?" I was very near
the door when I made the remark, and I didn't wait for the
reply.
His Diary.
July 18th.—Things are reaching a crisis. I can't "sleep now.
All night long I tossed about thinking of brilliant things to say
to her, and the more I strived after epigrams which should
have a slight tinge of sadness in them, the more my mind
became a blank, and I could only repeat, "She goes in three
days! What will become of me?" Of course, I am in love—
more so than I have ever been—and, mingled with gout, it is a
terrible disease. And she is in love too. Why does her hand
tremble when it touches mine? Why does the colour mount to
her face whenever we meet? Why do we both prefer to be
silent when we are together? Because we cannot talk of jtho
things which are in our minds, and so we prefer to think. The
idea of ever gaining her father's consent seems to me pre-
posterous at the present moment. If I could only save her life,
or her mother's—not his—something that would entitle me to
his gratitude. But people never are grateful. It would
probably make him hate me more than he already does if I
rendered him a service. I must think of something else. But
what? In vain I beat my brain to think of something that will
show me in a favourable light to him. It is no use sitting here
writing—I must go to bed—back to the hot pillows which I
turn again and again, till, in desperation, I throw them on to
the floor and lie flat on my back, staring up at the ceiling in
blank despair.
Her Diary.
July 18th.—Papa dislikes him more and more, and I am sure
his affection for me increases in proportion. What is to be
done? I have started a cough—a little hacking cough; and if
they are very unkind to me I mean to develop consumption.
Papa is already irritated by my cough. He said, "You have
caught cold, Maud. How the devil did you manage to do
that?" I said, "I don't know. I daresay it's nothing—only—
I always feel tired now." Mamma was really uneasy, and said
I must sec a doctor. If the doctor would only recommend me
the waters to gargle and inhale, I shouldn't mind. It would
keep us hero till the end of his " cure." What will he do with-
out me! He told me yesterday that his movements were
uncertain, that he should probably not stay after the 23rd,
and he threw such meaning and sadness into the date. It
would be terrible if I were the cause of shortening his treat-
ment and preventing his restoration to health. I should never
forgive myself. How I wish J had gout, then Papa couldn't
say anything. I might imitate the faces Papa makes when he
gets a twinge, but nothing would induce me to imitate his
language. Only three days more, unless a miracle takes place.
His Diary.
July 19th.—Only two days more, and she is ill. How inhuman
of them to take her away. She coughs, and has a drooping
appearance. Can it be grief? We never have a moment alone!
She told me yesterday that she had never beon so sorry to
leave any place. I managed to whisper that I liked it at
present, but after she had gone it would seem like—I stopped
for want of a proper simile. "I know the place you mean,"
she said; "Papa often mentions it."

I think I will write to her to-morrow. It may be dishonour-
able to do so without her parents' knowledge, but with such
inhospitable parents one must deal differently. They are going
to Paris for a few days, and from there liome to their place in
Sussex. It is all hopeless; I shall never see her again. I am
decidedly better, but what does it matter how 1 am if I lose
her?
Her Diary.
July 19t/t.—There is not the slightest sign of a miracle, and I
shall never see him after the 22nd of this month. 1 coughed
till I really made myself hoarse, and then Papa and Mamma both
decided that I wanted change of air. 1 have never coughed
since, still they say that it is
a warning that I have ex-
hausted this air. What rub-
bish people talk about health!
I almost feel as if I must con-
fide in Mamma; I should like
to throw myself at her feet and
tell her that 1 love him, and
that as she was young herself
once, and, I supposed, loved
Papa at that period, she must
have pity on me. She is very
good and sweet, 1 think she
would understand me; but Papa
would be driven clean out of
his mind, and probably have
a very bad relapse. Besides,
1 don't know that he loves me.
I think he thinks I am rather
nice, and ho certainly prefers
to talk to me to anyone. He
knows people here, and he has
refused all their invitations;
but is that sufficient to implore
Mamma to stay another week?
I can write no more—my brain
is wandering.
His Diary.
July 20th.—It is done. I have
written to her ! Without vanity,
I think I may say I composed a
beautiful letter. It was simple,
manly and straightforward. I
told her frankly that I loved
her, that I had never loved
anyone until I met her, and
then I gave some necessary
details of my position and past life, and, finally, begged
for a few words of hope. I have just given the letter,
together with a louis, to the chambermaid of her floor, and
to-morrow morning I shall know the worst. Of course, sleep is
out of the question; I don't even feel like going to bed. I have
only been here sixteen days, and what a (mange has been
effected in my life! How blindly one looks at tlie" jutofe! I
came here thinking only of my gout and the wretched" three
weeks I should have to spend here, and now all changed-. ■ I
think only of her, night and day. 'y
Her Diary.
Jnly20tli.—Ho has written to me! How imprudent of him,
but how delightful to read his fervent, truthful words, and
know that ho really cares for no one in the world but me! He
asks me to marry him, to be only his, to drag his soul from the
slough of despair in which it is at present plunged. Nothing
could be more beautiful or clever than his choice of words, and
his handwriting is exquisite—firm and legible. What was I to
do? I read his eight pages over and over again, and then I

decided to seek Mamma's assistance, so I tapped gently at her
j door, and begged her to come and talk to me in my room. It
was very difficult, and poor Mamma was quite unprepared for
my news. Sho said she was just saying her prayers, and thought
I she had finished with one day's miseries at any rate. But I
explained to her that this was not sorrow; it was joy—
unspeakable joy, for me. She seemed to think it very extra-
I ordinary that 1 should care for h man of whom I knew so little,
but I told her that there was no reason in love; if people
reasoned it wouldn't be love, it would be calculation. This
argument seemed to strike her, and then, with many blushes, I
showed her his letter. Of |course, sho couldn't help admiring
his beautiful phrases—although
she didn't acknowledge it; but
she shook her head, and said
Papa would never consent to
my marrying a gouty man.
"Then I shall die!" I ex-
claimed. "And the sooner the
better. You know I am ill, and
I believe you want to kill me
on purpose." Then Mamma
cried, and I cried too, and
finally I got her to consent to
my going over to the Dentons
to-morrow; and he may come
too, if he likes (by another
train); and if we really seem
to care for each other when
we are without the restraint
of third people I am to write,
and then she will see what can
be done with Papa. "It is
better that you should not be
there when the news is broken
to him," she said, in her dear
old complaining voice. "Ho
might throw something at
you." So then I hugged her
for ever so long, and let her
go to bed, and I sat down and
wrote a very guarded, modest
letter to Percy—I shall cer-
tainly call him Percy- in my
diary. I have looked out the
trains; I leave at 10.0 and
there is a train for him about
12.3. I shan't sleep to-night.
His Diary.
Vichy, July 21st.—We are both here—she staying with the
Dentons, I at another hotel. Sho has consented, conditionally
on her father's approval. Too excited and bewildered to write.
Her Diary.
Vichy, July 22nd.—We are so happy; but all depends on
Mamma's' letter to-morrow. Vichy is such a pretty place, and
the a-ir* perfectly delightful. As for the Dentons, no words can
erprcss their kindness. I can't write, I have so much to think
Of. .. -;
* July 23i d.—A very sweet letter from Mamma. She says the
worst is over. She let Papa work off the superfluous language
for at least half-an-hour before she interrupted him, and then
she gradually explained to him that I was really in love with
Percy, and making myself quite ill at the thoughts of a separa-
tion—also that I must marry some day, and that Mr. Goring
my own darling Percy—was certainly a desirable parti, and a
lot of other very clever arguments, and finally, towards the
evening, Papa consented to interviewing Percy, and if he can
give satisfactory reasons for his gout he will perfuips consider

reader, have I told you about

to itself later on. Between it

myself iu a light loam early in

slowly and distinctly twenty-

of it all doesn't sink into your

Alas, poor leaf! If it were still
upon the tree, it would not
lie upon the dark damp earth;
stirred by the gentle wind
'twould murmur a thousand
caressing messages to its little
brothers! Fate willed it otherwise. Ah,
complete, ah, mournful parable of life!
The leaf is not on the tree. It lies
upon the ground—lies between the tree
and the dear pansies; forsaken, deso-
late, alone. The apple-tree is on its
right — dread symbolism ! — the pansy-
border on its left. The leaf is on the
ground.

in the garden from ten o'clock to four—
Saturdays, ten to one—and put down my
thoughts just as they come, mixed up

eyes, two feet, and one beak. But tho
early worm has left some hours ago on
pressing business. Ah, dearest reader,

late! Too late! Too late! Oh, the bitter-

Yet even here fresh disappoint-

The pump is out of order. Be-
sides, there arc no geraniums
to water. The cat scratched
them all up last week.
Now it is nearly lunch-time,

ter. Down the pleasant path
I stray, among the mignonette

Still, even then, that was not all,
'Tis rumoured, farther back, Vauxhall
Was in a worse condition.
But nowadays we 've changed all that;

With former expedition.

Question. I think you are the master of a

A. Of the reversed positions of master

Q. Can you give an instance to prove
your meaning?
A. Yes, many; but perhaps one may
suffice. In the past, the remains of the
dinner of tho parlour went down to feed
the occupants of the kitchen. Nowadays,
tho dining-room may consider itself lucky
if it receives a cut off the joint from the
servants' hall.
Q. Do you find that there is less
inclination to work amongst servants
than there used to be?
A. Assuredly. In tho days of old, a
Sunday out was a concession made once a
month. Now, two half-holidays a week
and a whole holiday every seventh day is
quite the regulation.
Q. Do you dread to ring the bell?
A. Certainly, because the housemaid
will not bring up the coals, and the foot-
man has a soul above the ascent of a jug
of hot water.
Q. You mean that your servants think
more of their dignity than your comfort?
A. Quite so; and this idea, carried to
excess, renders life in a furnished house
a perfect misery.
Q. Do you know any remedy by which
things may be set straight?
A. Yes, by letting your house and living
at a hotel.
Q. But what will become of the servants
if you do this?
A. If they have a spell of responsibility
as their own employers, they may learn to
resume their old-fashioned fidelity.
1 Q. And when that happy time arrives,
what will you do?
A. Give up hotel life, and go home
again.

I sit beneath the sun with empty hands,

Incontinent and take a sudden chair
And tell the untutored crowd what might be dono
If there were men to do it, and return
And write the records of the Man Who Did.
I cannot rest for very long on end.
For I have been a portion of the Turf,

And marked their modes of intermittent thought,
Strange customs, ay, and manners stranger still;
And had a party of my own, and led
Until the turn of fortune loft me tired.

In praise of privacy, most dull it were
To be regarded merely as a name,

From some removed and settled vantage-ground,

Of others, unembarrassed by the risk

(A thing most inconvenient), yet I hold
That if this world-wide realm, than which I know
Of none more free or more beneficent,
Means to fulfil her high Imperial charge,
I should account it matter for regret
Were I to have no thumb within that pie.
*****
Deep calls to deep; there lies, a splendid hulk,
Our grand old wherry, wheezing off the shore;
Seaworthy once, but now severely strained
And pirouetting in a fatuous round
With rival rowers working different ways.
Groggy, I grant, she is, and lists to port,
But has a lot of service in her yet.
Come then, my noble tars, who oft have fared
Through sunshine with me (and through storm, without),
Come let us give the seas another chance.
Bring on your well-fed b's'n; step aboard;
Shove off and plough the furrows, sitting tight
In any order which occurs to you
So that you somehow get the thing to go.
It may be we shall spring a loathsome leak
And ultimately rot upon the sands,
Not those we ploughed of old, but somewhere else;
It may bo we shall touch Elysian fields
And sit with blessed Harcourt hand in hand,
And wallow in official asphodel.
For though we have to mourn some splintered planks
(Old platform-wood) we will replace the same
With heart of oak; and though we may not be
That happy family which onco we were,
Still, at the worst, why, what we are, we are;
A desperate crew adventuring the deep
Toward no particular port this side the polls,
Nor, for that matter, down the dim beyond,
But sworn to float or founder with the flag.
*****
P.S. On second thoughts, my gallant crew
Shall go without me: I will stay at home
And check their movements on a private chart.

AN "X '-HIBITION; OR, ALGEBRA AT THE ALHAMBRA.
The algebraic problem is to find the value of "X" to the
Alhambra Co., as represented by the General Manager, Mr.
Dundas Slater, under whose auspices the " Entirely New and
Wondrous Illusion" is now being nightly presented to the
puzzled public. A Masked Lady in theatrical "boy's" costume
runs on to the stage, bows to the audience, then runs away dis-
appearing behind some curtains, whence in a few seconds
emerges a kind of balloon flower-basket carrying the upper
half of, apparently, this same Masked Lady, while for the nonce
the lower half has entirely disappeared. There was once, in
bygone ages, a certain "Miss Biffin" exhibited, who was a
legless lady. Is this the solution of the new "Illusion"?
Does the legless one appear as "the double" of the leggy
lady? However it is done, the effect is elegtrifying. Up she
goes, carried in a basket, as was the elderly lady whp went
to sweep the cobwebs off the sky, so that people on earth
should get a clear view of the moon, until she is very near the
gallery, and then, always gracefully bowing, and scattering
flowers right and left of her, turning right round as if moving
on a pivot like one of those half-length dummies in a hairdresser's
shop, she is slowly lowered, and in her floral and aerial car she
is carried back to the stage, disappears behind the curtains,
and suddenly re-appears, running down to the flote, kissing her
hands to the audience, and, taking good care that there shall
not be the slightest doubt as to the existence of her legs, she
runs off merrily, leaving everyone staggered and wondering.
We have had the "Problem Play," now we have got "The
Problem Entertainment." The latter is distinctly the more
amusing.
After this, the comic billiardists, Messrs. Kelly and
Gillette, contrive to restore us to the realities of life in their
most eccentric and amusing knockabout scene. The Alhambra
Ballet, which is called Inspiration, is as effective as ever; but the
problem is the thing. Hero "X," on which no "X-rays" throw
any light, is an unknown quantity—yet not Xactly that—as two
logs can't be precisely an unknown quantity. But where do these
two legs walk off to by themselves? What becomes of these
detached legs? The lady should, when up above, have a song
to sing to the old tune of The Girl I left behind Me, to be
entitled "The Legs I left behind Me 1" It is quite the knee
plus ultra Of puzzles, and we 're content to leave it that,
congratulating the Alhambra on the engagement of a lady who
without legs can put the entertainment on a sound footing.
WRITE AND WRONG.
[Dr. T. A. Stewabt, the Chief Inspector of Schools in Scotland, calls bad
writing " immoral."]
Oh, Doctor, though you 're rightfully annoyed
At vile caligraphy, your rage exciting;
Indeed, I 'in not of virtue all devoid,
Though 1 must own to wretchedly bad writing.
'Tis true when once I wrote " immortal verse"
(Or verse I thought deserved a deathless laurel),
Banned by the angry printer's devil's curse,
With shame I found my verse became "immoral."
Yet spare your strictures to a suppliant sad,
To one who owns his failings be propitious,
Nor say because my characters are bad,
My character is consequently vicious.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE END OF EUSTACE JENKINS.
Not without reluctance do I take up my
pcn to relato the circumstances which led
to the untimely end of Eustacb Jenkins.
But I find it necessary to justify my own
share in the matter, and feel convinced
that when the truth is known it will be
found that I was actuated—not by any
petty feelings of pique or spite, but^by
a desire to benefit the community at large
—pro bono publico, as my young Eton
brother would say.
Eustace Jenkins was by nature a very
serious-minded young man. Some of his
lady friends thought him clever, but I
think that aspersion was due to the fact
that he wore spectacles and looked bilious.
At the same time, it is only fair to add that
he once created quite a stir among some
elderly relatives by a letter to the
Spectator on "the moral qualities of the
beetle."
Some serious-minded young men have
been known to make themselves objec-
tionable. Not so Eustace Jenkins. Ex-
hilarating as a companion he certainly
was not, but a certain diffidence (possibly
justified) in his own powers of conversa-
tion made him a silent and by no means
unpleasant companion. For he possessed
this most rare and admirable quality: he
was an excellent listener.
To this quality I attribute the fact that
he was a man with many friends. What
such a man might not have done with his
negative merits must be left to idle
speculation- Speaking for myself, I am
bound to say that often when I have felt
the spirit of loquacity rise within me, and
when I have felt that I must have an
audience, Jenkins has done what no other
friend would do for me. He has listened
attentively while 1 discoursed for hours.
This much I wish to record, in justice to
the memory of my friend.
But, alas, about three months ago he
underwent a terrible change. Some mis-
guided person told him of a riddle then
coming into fashion: "Why did the
blankety blank," or "What made the
what-you-uiay-call-it thingum-a-bob ?'' Up
to then, Jenkins had never been guilty of an
attachment for humour of any kind ; even
while awaiting his turn at the barber's he
would bring out a pocket-edition of
EMERSON'S Essays for perusal, and shun
the harmless comic cut. But the riddle
craze made of him another man. A curse
on these verbal atrocities! Alas! My poor
friend bought up every paper that con-
tained the least reference to these lingual
barbarities.
Nor was this the worst. The riddle-
fever made him restless and talkative.
He would rush up to chance acquaintances
with all kinds of imbecile Why did's, and
Why was's, till the sight of his spectacled
features became a terror to all who knew
him.

He. "Very tunny, isn't it?'' She. "Very."
He. "Of course you understand French well?"
Be. "But you laugh." She. "So do the others.
[ The title of the song is
She. "Not a word."
Personne ne comprend.'
I watched the progress of this insidious'
disease with horror and dismay, and was
the more pained as the unfortunate
Jenkins never was able to invent a
riddle of his own, or to recall any
that had not already become a club
chestnut.
The craze is bad enough, the pun-riddle
is trying, even at the best. But when
the riddle lias a musty, mildewy appear-
ance !1 At last 1 made up my mind.
Matters had reached a climax. Several
of my friends were already prostrate1
with nervous headaches entirely due to
the questionings of Eustace Jenkins.
Last week Jenkins came to see me after
dinner. I had staying with me an uncle
rich in everything but a good temper.
If there was one thing he disliked more
than another it was a pun. For myself,
I was far from wjll, and when I saw
Jenkins I knew by the feverish glitter
in his eye that he was in a dangerous
condition.
So, after considering matters all round,
I made up my mind.
Before greeting Jenkins, I loaded my
revolver.
"Hullo, old chap," said he, "why ,"
I pointed the weapon and fired.
Jenkins fell back. "What made tho
bullet dum?" ho murmured, then expired.
I explained to my uncle, who then
entered the room, that my friend had
suffered from a painful and incurable
disease. He was so pleased with my
humanity that he has added a codicil of
a gratifying description to his will.
*****
At the inquest the jury exonerated me
completely. They, too, had suffered from
the riddle craze. A. R.

THE LIBERAL SOCIAL-ISM.
["Nine-tenths of the existence of society, and the whole of its point of
view, are false and unhealthy, and a Liberal can no more partake of that
existence without being weakened in Bome way or other than he can take
poison and receive no injury. We cannot imagine any community of idea
or faith between a great reforming party inspired by the Bpirit of humble
humanity and that organisation of flitting and dining and gossiping known as
society."—Echo.]
Awake, Opposition, your parlous position
Is due to your own impropriety,
In mixing and thronging with people belonging
To what's understood as Society.
The flitting and flirting undoubtedly's hurting
Your liberal stomach for fight, Sirs.
You come to the lobby from some social hobby;
Do you think such behaviour is right, Sirs?
In circles unhealthy you move, where the wealthy
And idle and useless hold sway, Sirs,
And their vileness and taint will stick like wet paint;
Oh, try to keep out of their way, Sirs!
You are far too much scon in that poopled demesne
The Park, where on Sunday you bask, Sirs.
'What with dances and dinners and talking with sinners,
You 're surely unfit for your task, Sirs.
At the theatre and opera, dressed like a fop or a
Twentieth-century beau,
You are frequently noted; or smartly frock-coated
You have actually lounged in the Row.
At a swagger hotel you 've been noticed as well,
Shaking hands with an aristocrat,
And been once or twice met with a fast, racing set—
Oh, the stigma attaching to that 1
You have dined tt la carte at a restaurant smart
With effrontery simply astonishing;
But your manner so hearty is wrecking your party,
And calls for the strongest admonishing.
So, Liberals, pray to tho country away,
Society animadverting,
And exclusively ponder in silence and wonder
Your side-splitting action diverting.
OCCASIONAL OPERATIC NOTES.
Finishing up. Tuesday.—Old Friend Faust, with Mme. Calve
as Marguerite. Certainly not seen, in such a wig, at her best
nor heard at her best either. Miss Kirkby Lunn excellent as
Stebei. Mr. Waostaff whispered to Sir Alexander Mackenzie
his regret that "Miss Lunn's name was not Sarah, as, had it
been, ""Had it been," interrupted Sir Alec, " you would
have said that the successful Sally Lunn took the cake! Good
evening," and the eminent composer departed, triumphantly
chuckling, leaving Mr. "Waostaff " plants la."
Wednesday, July 17.—Your Musical Representative being
unavoidably prevented from attending in his place at the
production of Le Roi d'Ys—libretto by Edouard Blau and
music by Edouakd Lalo ("two 'Eds are bettcr*than one")—for
the first time at Covent Garden, although it has been known
in Paris for some years, was represented by a distinguished Lady
Musical Critic in whose opinion he has the most perfect confi-
dence, although knowingly allowing himself to be Miss-repre-
sented. Your M.R.'s miss-representative pronounced favourably
on the Opera, and says, that though to some extent Wagnerish,
yet on the whole the airs were, to put it meteorologically in this
excessively hot temperature, " light and various." With such a
Margared as Mile. Paquot, the success of this part was assured,
while " Pretty Seeusan," operatically known as Madame Suzanne
Adams, was, as in singing so in acting, an ideal Rozenn. The
majestic Plancon was excellent as Le Roi qui ne s'amuse pas.
M. Jerome, as Mylio the victorious, will be a good boy and do
better next time; while as Karnae the Konkered, M. Seveilhac
was good but not great. The stony-hearted statue of the Com-
mendatore who personally conducts the wicked Don Juan to
"down there," has now an animated operatic rival in the
operatic living statue of Saint Corentin, whose music was well
given by M. Journet, organ and choir being "heard without."
The audience, being in melting mood, on this lovely [night in
July, quite envied Margared's final plunge into the canvas sea.
What was left unmelted of your representative's miss-
representative expressed great contentment, and Y. R. trusts
to personally pay his respects to His Majesty Le Roi d'Ys at
his next gracious reception. So Vive Le Roi I
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Of its kind, says my Nautical Retainer, I have read nothing
so remarkable as Zack's story of The White Cottage (Archibald
Constable). It is of the rare books that leave you with a sense
that the author has had faith in your intelligence and imagina-
tion. It is a close and delicate study of character, treated
dramatically rather than analytically; in the sense that you
arrive at results, in action or speech, without superfluous dis-
cussion of mental processes. The reserve of language natural
to these Wessex folk adds its own force to the economy of the
tale. The effect of such methods, in the hands of an author who
adds a fine imagination to a sincere knowledge of the kind of
character with which she deals, is constantly to delight the
reader by the piquancy of unforeseen conclusions, which still
in the retrospect compel him to acknowledge their inevitability.
Both the theme and the locale of the story recall Thomas
Hardy; and if one looks in vain for the personal charm of his
manner there is abundant compensation in the undissipated in-
tensity of the matter. Indeed, the author seems nowhere to
have sought to embroider her work with literary graces; at
times it is almost carelessly defective in the first elements of
style; but she is an artist without knowing it, or without
letting you see that she knows it; and the gain in sheer vitality
is not to be questioned. Tho book possesses, along with a
subtler imagination, that essentiality which characterises the
short stories of Maupassant; but Zack succeeds, where
Maupassant generally failed, in preserving this quality over a
sustained narrative. That the book is tragic even in its joys
will not give it less favour in the eyes of the only kind of public
whose heart is worth winning. The Baron de B.-W.

He is learned to dispute on
Principles laid down by Newton,
And he likewise knows, of course,
All the laws about the force.

He must see folk are not dead,

THE BLACK FOREST VADE-MECUM.
It may not be generally known that in
the picturesque region of Germany called
the Schwarz-Wald there exists a society
called the Association of Black Forest
Proprietors, with headquarters at Horn-
berg. For the benefit of British travellers
this society publishes a little handbook of
"Hints," which is a distinctly precious
volume. In the first paragraph, after
somo useful advice about beds, children,
&c, the writer says:
"On the visitor receiving a special offer, with
prices and details, we would recommend him, if the
offer be suitable, to write at once, or even should
the place be much frequented or tho season ad-
vanced, to telegraph his acceptance, otherwise he
may easily be too late. For, as a matter of course,
the hotel proprietor cannot hold himielf bound hy
the many offers he is obliged to make daily. Like
any other business man, he offers so long as dis-
engaged, i.e. providing that on receipt of an
answer accepting his oner its execution is still
possible."
This is magnificent. Note—(1) the
landlord makes the traveller an offer, (2)
the traveller accepts the offer, (3) but
when tho traveller arrives at the inn the
landlord may declare the deal off. This is
very like tho old game of "Heads I win,
tails you lose," and it may bo a Black
Forest game known as Spoufchen. As to
pension, the guide remarks after pointing
out the social advantages of boarding—
"Of course in this case a punctual attendance at
table is necefsary, a point in which many visitors
leave much to be desired. It is really mrprising
how many otherwise nice, highly educated and
fashionable people cause annoyance to the manage-
ment, the servants and their fellow boarders by
daily coming to table tco late."
Ye gods! this is, indeed, a lesson in
manners whinh should be taken to heart
by such "otherwise nice people" as tho
Earl and Countess of Cockalorum, Sir
Dionysius Periwig, Captain Corkington,
of the Manx Guards, and others of the
beau monde, who imagine that most
London dinners begin when dessert time
arrives. Wo readily allow that in the
Black Forest such culpable tardiness may
annoy the management and tho menials;
but we cannot believe that the early
birds are dissatisfied, since they will, if
wise, have devoured all the best table-
d'hote worms before the arrival of the
"highly-educated, fashionable," but dila-
tory—"otherwise nice"—ones. Passing
by the question of children, in big or little
beds, let us turn to the Canine Question.
Quoth the guide—
"As the taking of dogs and other pet animals
causes the landlord, the servants, and also the visi-
tors, greatest annoyance, and as, moreover, these
animals, apart from inevitable nuisances, cause
great damage to the arrangement of rooms, carpets,
upholstery, curtains, and also to beds, visitors
cannot be sufficiently recommended to leave their
dogs and other pet animals at home."
Another way of saying, "No dogs ad-
mitted." But what are the other pet
animals? Monkeys, cats, mongooses,
lions, tigers, foxes? Let them be sche-
duled by the hotel proprietors, or, one of
these days, we shall hear of a Briton
arriving with a polar bear and defying
ejection from the premises. Next the
guide urges that articles of value should
be given over to tho landlord, as in case
of loss the visitor "would save much
annoyance and difficulty, ae he would
have to prove that tho objects in question
had really been brought into the hotel and
lost there." This casta a distinct slur of
dishonesty on the visitor, and seems to
imply that he travels about pretending to
lose his treasure in unsuspicious hostel-
ries. It is then pointed out that the Post
Office will not deliver registered letters
and money orders without the traveller
proving his identity. The voyager na-
turally appeals to the landlord.
"This, however, the hotel proprietor cannot be
expected to.do for people quite unknown to him.
We therefore earnestly advise visitors of the
Black Forest to take some proof of their identity, or
in case they have neglected to do this to have their
registered letters or money orders sent to them
under cover addressed to the care of the hotel
proprietor."
If this means anything at all, it is that
the landlord, being a thought-reader,
although he cannot identify a visitor for
the benefit of the Post Office, knows him
at once when he (the hotel-keeper) has
the valuables in his keeping. The clause
about cheques is worth a king's ransom.
It says—
"Foreigners (especially Englishmen) often want
to pay their hotel bills by cheques payable abroad.
They do not consider that a cheque is not ready
money, but only an order on a bank, and that a
conscientious and prudent business man is not
bound to take for granted that it will be duly-
honoured, unless the drawer is personally known to
him as a thoroughly good and solvent man. But
this is seldom the case."
The last sentence is appalling. Has tho
Black Forest been visited by swarms of
depredators, who spread their worthless
drafts among the confiding inhabitants?
It would unhappily seem so, and that
they were "especially Englishmen." The
vade mecum goes on to say, "An hotel-
keeper is less averse to taking in payment
so-called circular notes—cash payments
are, however, tho best." Of course they
are. Hoch 1 hoch! hoch! for the merry
innkeepers of the Schwarz-Wald!
THE STRAYED THOUGHT.
In Life what joy, what hope?
Ah me ! a veil is drawn
Athwart the sun. I grope
In darkness and lift up the cry of one
forlorn.
I rose, to find thee fled,
Whom I had made mine own.
Thee, whom I cherished,
And reared in my mind uptn a daedal
throne.
When first thou earnest to me
In exultation wild
I sank upon one knee.
Nor half my love for thee e'er parent had
for child.
Yet ever wert thou coy
And wayward as the wind,
My pale, elusive joy,
But thou art gone and I am left with
Yoided mind.
For thee I sighed for fame.
Ink, inspiration, thou!
The lustre of a name
To have, thou, one of three, shouldst have
informed me how.
On Thamis' watery coil
I hoped, thou to inspire,
To fling my midnight oil
And see his bosom blaze with dropping
globes of fire.
For thou wert all I had,
My ewe-thought, ah! unkind
To fly me, too, too bad.
To coldly stray beyond tho margin of my
mind.
A sense of lonliness
Came o'er thee, straying thought!
But what of my distress?
For now that thou art fled: I have no
mind—for aught!

UN HOTEL DE PROVINCE.
Stifling in Paris. Worse in the trains.
Night journey to Zurich long and gritty.
Black smoke, whistles, screams, jolts,
gritty floor, gritty seat in the wagon-lits,
with a bed that jumps up and down, and
sheets and pillow which soon become
gritty also. It might be better to stop
some%vhere on tho way, and sleep com-
fortably. Search Baedeker and discover,
half-way to Zurich, Langros, an old
French town on a high hill. That sounds
more ajry. Will go there.
Five hours in tho express quite long
enough. Arrive at Langres in the after-
noon. Get out, to the evident surprise
of the railway officials, and go up by
little hill railway to the town. It is an
old-fashioned provincial town, with an
old-fashioned provincial inn. The land-
lord ushers mo up to vast state apart-
ment. Sofa, arm-chair, and numerous
other chairs, all covered with crimson
velvet, two gigantic mirrors in gilt frames,
immense gilt clock, actually going cor-
rectly, family portraits on walls, table
with crimson velvet cover. A voyage of
discovery reveals the bedstead, hidden
beneath a mountainous e'dredon, in a re-
mote corner, but the washstand is not to
bo found. Search everywhere. At last

and wonder if there is any ink in the

dim corner, a wcll-dcsigncdold escritoire.
Open the top and perceive a small white
object, round and rising up in the middle,
rather larger than a coffee-cup. It is
doubtless a big old-fashioned crockery

inkstand. Look closer. It is not! It is
the jug and the hand-basin. I have dis-
covered the washstand.
However, if but little water is provided,
the room is perfectly clean. Not a speck
of dust anywhero. When I go to bed I
summon the garcon, and ask, knowing that
it is an absurd question, if there is a bath
in the house. Of course not. "Mais vous
avez des bains de siige, natv.rellem.ent f"
The waiter hesitates. "Je crots que on J,
monsieur, je vais demander." Then he
goes away, and after some time returns
with a dejected air. "Ah, monsieur!"
says he, in an agitated manner, "le patron
dit que nous avons un bain de siige, mats
il a 6ti brine", et le patron ne Va pas fait
raccommoder, comme ca, e'est impossible."
His hands spread out, his shoulders rise,
he is tho imago of despair. There is a
painful pause. Suddenly a bright idea
|strikes him. "Mais nous avons un bain
de pieds, monsieur!" And in the morning
a tiny footbath makes its appearance. I
do not venture to step into it, for long
ago in a French provincial inn I once tried
to stand in a footbath, whereupon the
bottom at once gave way, and the precious
water, obtained after infinite negotia-
tions, was lost over tho whole surface of
the floor.
Afterwards my caje-au-lait is served up,
with a bowl to drink it from which is
larger than the hand-basin, and a noble
napkin at least four times the size of one
of the tiny essuic-mains which, together,
took the place of a bath towel. It is
quite an old-fashioned hotel de. province,
but it is clean, absurdly cheap, and tho
proprietor and his servants are as polite
as possible. 1 tako a stroll round the
town, I see tho distant view towards
Switzerland, and then I go on to Basle
and Zurich. H. D. B.

VIEWS ABOUT A VIEW.
(Some Topical Thought-reading.)
The Jerry-Builder's. What a fuss about
a few trees and a bit of riverside! What
finer view cam there be than a neat little
row of our red-and-whito brick villas,
rent £30 per annum ; two reception, three
bod, and two dressing-rooms, bath-room
(h. and c), kitchen and usual offices;
easily reached from Bank of England and
West-End stations by Twopenny Tube and
Id. electric tram every three or four
minutes; near public library and large
recreation ground? Besides, as our
houses are guaranteed to collapse in two
and a half years, the landscape will soon
bo agreeably diversified with picturesque
ruins, which should appeal toevery artistic
eye.
The Old Inhabitant's. Well, of all the
robbery! Here, this view has been our
chief commercial asset since the days of
Poi'B and Walpolh. It has been dis-
covered over a hundred and fifty years,
and has brought any amount of custom
into the town. Why, the hotels and
boarding-houses are run on the strength
of it, and if this act of spoliation is
allowed, 1 shall never let my house again!
The view is part and parcel of the place,
and it is perfectly scandalous, Sir, that
upstart vaudals should bo allowed to
tamper with it! What! Ask me to sub-
scribe to save it? Why, it's of world-
wide importance—you had better write to
Mr. Carnegie or Mr. Pierpont Morgan.
Only Americans properly appreciate our
scenery.
The American Visitor's. You don't say!
Wal, I guess I '11 buy your toy county
right hero, and take the viow back home.
Calculate wo'd fix it up in a roof-garden
corner, alongside of Stratford-on-Avon,
transhipped to-day. Shake!

at least, not where the missus and 1
want to go of a Sunday. No more bricks-
and-mortar within char-ii-banc range,
I say. Let 'em take their blooming

The Solicitors' and Auctioneers'. This
outbreak of sentiment is really too absurd!
How are we to make a living if the country
is not to bo properly developed? This par-
ticular estate is admirably "ripe," and it
would bo a sin to neglect such an oppor-
tunity. These ridiculous landscape-lovers

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from thi Diary of Toby, M.P
House of Commons, Monday, July 15.—
Young Members had a taste to-day of
pro-historic times; opportunity of
observing how things worked (or didn't
work) beforo the era of the closure.
Chairman of Ways and Moans laid up with
gout. Stuart - Wortley, one of the
appointed deputies, takes the Chair in his
absence. So far good. LOWTHER, J. W.,
is one of the two best Chairmen of the
last quarter of a century. But Sti'ART-
Wortley, for what must be regarded as an
amateur, served admirably. Oa\y he is not
invested with power to put the closure in
force. When that beneficent rule was
slowly driven through House of Commons,
adast stand was made round the bodies of
deputies.
"Let the Speaker and Chairman of

Merry Horsham.
An Impression of Mr. H-yw-d J-hnst-ne's smile.
Ways and Means wield this debasing,
demoralizing power if they must; but
spare, oh, spare our feelings by not deput-
ing it to the deputy." Thus good Conser-
vatives of the day.
Concession was made on this point,
though why a man capable of performing
duties of Chairman should not be trusted
to say whether closure may or may not
bo moved is one of those things that beat
Banaghcr. To-night absurdity of situa-
tion forced on notice. Hour after hour
Stuart - Wortley sits in Chair whilst
CHANNINO chatters, and Macnamara at
prodigious length makes his moan. Not
even decent pretence made of saying
anything new; speeches delivered at
Second Reading re-hashed; benches
empty, but Members kept at hand in case
of a division; Chairman impotent to deal
with dreary farce.
Once when Mr. Plummbr turned aside

A Pencil Kodak of the Prime Minister.
to discourse on the Battle of Waterloo,
Chairman ventured to observe that that
event, though interesting and historical,
had nothing to do with the question
immediately before the Committee. In
vain Prince Arthur pleaded for the
division. Squire OF Malwood, happening
to look in before going to dinner, fell
upon him and sorely buffeted him. Not
often Opposition has a chance like this;
ridiculous to suppose they would not make
the most of it.

East "Phi'r.ntLro-y.
M ■. Ein-st F.-w-r.
So through the dead, unhappy night tht!
talk went on till stroke of midnight
sounded the adjournment. For all
practical purposes, adjournment might
just as well havo tako.i place at a quarter-
pist five when House got into Committee.
Kecognising hopelessness of situation,
further dealing with measure deferred till
Monday next, by which time it is hoped
Lowther, J. W., will havo come again,
bringing his sheaves with him in shape of
the closure.
Business done.—None.
House of Lords, Tuesday.—In an ancient
document few have been privileged to see
it is written that when, a little more than
seven centuries ago, Sir David of WEMYSS
escorted the Maid of Norway on her jour-
ney to Scotland ho made only one remark.
"But," as the chronicle here translated
quaintly puts it, "it lasted all the way
from Norway till the shores of Scotland
were sighted."

There must necessarily have been
intervals for refreshment and repose.
Nevertheless, as is well known, tho Maid
Margaret did not survive the ordeal,
dying ere she reached the shore, where
her betrothed, son of Edward First of
England, impatiently awaited her.
Curious how hereditary tendencies as-
sert themselves. Sir David of Wemyks
was an ancestor of the lusty young
bridegroom who is to-day ninth Karl of
WEMYSS. Times and manners have changed;
but Lord Wemysh possesses in degree
that gift of voluble speech which, seven
hundred and twenty-one years ago, proved
fatal to tho Maid of Norway. Some Mem-
bers still in the Commons remember when
Lord Elcho, standing well out from a
seat below the Gangway, nightly lectured
alike the Government of the day and Her
Majesty's Opposition. To-night, a belted
Earl, he is on his legs in the Lords, look-

ing hardly a year older, apparently not
having abated a jot of the energy that
marked his manner, when, just sixty
years ago, he took his seat for East
Clloucestershire. Forty-two years he sat
in the Commons, for the last thirty-six
representing Haddingtonshiro and the
Universe.
To-night he is concerned about the
plans of the Government Offices in
Whitehall and Parliament Street; wants
models to be made and publicly exhibited.
Pembroke pooh-poohs suggestion. Lans-
downe tries to laugh it out of the House.
WEMYSS just holds on; insists on taking
a division, and defeats the strongest
Government of modern times by more
than two to one.
"Such, Toby,dear boy," he said, when
I congratulated him on his success, "is
the result of natural eloquence when in-
formed by taste, sustained by knowledge,
and not hampered by considerations of
brevity."
Business done.—Commons talk all night
round Local Government Board Estimates,
and pass one vote.
House of Commons, Thursday.—Pretty
scene across Table between C.-B. and
Don Jose. Walter Long had moved for
leave to introduce Bill continuing the
Landlord and Clergy Relief Acts passed
in last Parliament; pleaded, as John
O'Gorst did on introducing Education
Bill, that the measure was a very little
one.
"Some people's geese are all swans,"
said the Squire ok Malwood, suiting his
simile to agricultural surroundings.
"This Government's are all goslings."
C.-B., arguing against the dole to land-
lords out of rates, quoted dictum on sub-
ject delivered, ho said, by a distinguished
Member of present Government. "Lord
Salisbury," so the extract ran, "coolly
proposes to hand over certain new cus-
toms duties to the landlords of the
country in the shape of a contribution
in aid of local taxes. I must say that 1
never recollect any man propose in a
franker, I might even say in a more
audacious manner, to rob Peter in order
to pay Paul. And what makes it worse
is that in this case Peter is represented
by the landless millions who have no
other wealth than their labour, while
Paul is a great landlord seeking to re-
lieve himself of his share of taxation by
shifting it on to the shoulders of his less
fortunate fellow-countrymen."
That is what Opposition said about
Agricultural Rating Bill when introduced
five years ago. That is what they say
now of attempt, when the country is
groaning under war taxation, to renew
the Act. Only no ono of them said it so
well, put the case in such pitiless, sting-
ing, memorable phrase.
C.-B. smacks his lips over the passage
as he quotes it, looking over top of manu-
script at Don Jose seated with impassive
countenance on the Treasury Bench,
buttressed on either sido by those blue-
blooded Tories Prince Arthur and St.
Michael. A jubilant cheer rises from
crowded Opposition Benches. Eight score
mocking faces turn upon the pale coun-
tenance apparently slumbering on the
Treasury Bench. Suddenly Don Josb,
dropping the mask, sprang to his feet,
waving C.-B. down with imperious move-
ment of the arm.
"Who said I ever said that?" he
angrily asked. "The right hon. Gentle-
man, as I understand, said that whilst I
was a member of the Government"
"Oh, no," C.-B. rose to explain, " itwas
not in the present Government. These
were his old doctrines before he"got into
his present company."
Don Jose still standing at Table whilst
C.-B. explained. Case made clear, he for
all response said, "Oh!" and waved
permission to C.-B. to go on, if he thought
it worth while. It was only one of his
old speeches of far-off '83 come home to
roost. He had gone through this ordeal
before. It amused his former colleagues,
and it didn't hurt him. Only none who
did not hear Don Jose utter that "Oh!"
dream what depths of scorn and contempt
lurk in the interjection.
Business done.—Landlords Relief Act to
be made permanent. Also the Clergy
ditto.
Friday.— The Markiss, as everyone
knows, has a pretty wit. One of its
flashes of late illumined the family circle.
Too good to be exclusively enjoyed at
Hatfield. Someone, discoursing on the
activity of Lord Hugh Cecil and Earl
Percy when any question affecting the
Church comes on in the House of Com-
mons, observed that though only half the
strength of the Fourth Party they are
a considerable power in Parliament and
only want a distinctive name.
"Call them the Hughligans," said the
Markiss, his eye dwelling with fatherly
affection on the slim figure and seraphic
countenance of son Hugh.
Business done.—In Committee of Supply.
"UP, UP, WITH THE STREETS 1"
The way they have in the City.
"Now then, gentlemen," said the
organiser, "I am at your service. It
certainly is a much-frequented thorough-
fare, but, of course, you must have it up
when necessary."
"Well, Sir," put in one of the repre-
sentatives, "I think we shall want
January for the sewers."
"Certainly. Sanitation before any-
thing. I have put you down for January."
"And, Sir, we shall want February for
the water-works," suggested a second
representative.
"No sort of objection. February for
you."
"Please, Sir," and the boy put out his
hand, but ho was ignored.
"May I have March for the Electric
Lighting? " asked a third representative.
The reply was in the affirmative. Then
another half a dozen or so obtained a
month apiece for various undertakings.
"We have got to December," observed
the organiser. "Well, the public can
enjoy the thoroughfares without inter-
ruption during the Christmas holidays."
"I am afraid not," said the last of the
representatives. "Because they must be
closed then for repairs."
"Please, Sir," asked the boy, who had
been trying to put the question all
through, "couldn't all these things be
done at one and the same time? Then,
you know, the thoroughfares would be
open eleven months out of"
"Silence I " interrupted the organiser.
"Don't talk nonsense."
The boy was silenced. But how about
the public?
HERE AND THERE.
Ik you were only here, GEORGE,
I think—in fact, I know,
We'd get a girl to steer, George,
And take a boat and row;
And, striking mighty bubbles
From each propulsive blade,
Forget that life had troubles
At ninety in the shade.
We'd swing along together,
And cheerily defy
This toasting, roasting weather,
This sunshine of July.
Our feather might be dirty.
Our style might not be great;
But style for men of thirty
(And more) is out of date.
You'd note with high elation—
I think I see you now—
The beaded perspiration
That gathered on your brow.
Oh, by that brow impearled, George,
And by that zephyr wet,
I vow in all the world, George,
There's nothing like a "sweat."
To row as if it mattered,
Just think of what it means:
All cares and worries shattered
To silly smithereens.
To row on such a day, George,
And feel the singe's'1 brain,
Its cobwebs brushed away, George,
Clear for its work again 1
But you at Henley linger,
While I am at Bourne-End.
You will not stir a finger
To come and join your friend.
This much at least is clear, George:
We cannot row a pair
So long as I am here, George,
And you remain up there. R. C. L.

Algernon db le Tante, that promising
young poet, soliloquises:
Had no idea -when I came to stay with
Lady Tapperton that I should be expected
to attend this kind of thing . . . pleases
the poor rustics, of course—but are they
worth pleasing? They don't even know
that a celebrity is among them; they make
coarse remarks about pigs and things,
even when I try to direct their thoughts
to loftier altitudes . . . asked one of
them—the Vicar's daughter, I think—
whether she had read Foul and Fair, my
last volume of exquisite sonnets . . . she
said she hadn't, but would like to, if it
would enable her to get a better price for
her chickens at Puddleton market! . . .
Here's another woman, in a horrid frock,
coming to pester me to buy things . . .

Bazaar's for the soldiers' widows and
orphans—" such an excellent cause" . . .
I argue the point . . . she is annoyed ; her
husband is a Colonel . . . tell her "I'm
sorry for her "... she goes, but others
of her tribe succeed her . . . No, I don't
want a buttonhole—such a buttonhole! . . .
and I can't take shares in a raffle for a
sowing-machine, and tea I never touch out-
side my own rooms . . . this is dreadful!
Isn't there any way of escape? . . . Here's
the tent of "Abracadabra, the cele-
brated Syrian fortune-teller ''; suppose
I have my fortune told? . . . Perhaps the
fortune-teller isn't a dreadful rustic, and
anyhow I shall be out of the rabble for a
while . . . the tent is empty apparently
—■ no, here 's the Prophetess . . . Good
gracious, it's Mrs. Smithson, a woman
I know (and abominate) in town! . . .
Too late to escape . . . very surprising;
she seems delighted to see me—doesn't
even suggest fortune-telling, but asks me
to make myself comfortable. . . I repose
elegantly in a deck-chair, and, at Mrs.
S.mithson's suggestion, light a cigarette

son 's gone away; wonder if I might take
a short nap. . . . Awakened by sound of
coarse laughter. . . Two rustics hastily
disappear through the tent door . . . un-
mannerly plebeians! . . . pose myself
again in graceful attitude, and light
another cigarette . . . more rustics enter,
stare at me in silence for a moment, then
guffaw loudly . . . with a languid wave
of my hand, I explain that the Prophetess
is temporarily absent, so they had better
go . . . they do so, roaring with laughter
. . . they are followed by others, all con-
vulsed with merriment when they see me.
Why? Wonder if my tie is disarranged,
or can there be a smut on my nose? . . .
Yet more rustics enter, guffaw loudly, and
disappear . . . this is becoming unbear-
able, I shall go . . . ah, here's Mrs.
Smithson. I thank her for allowing me
my cigarette, but she declares that the
obligation is on her side . . . what the
dickens does she mean? And she's
giggling all the while, too. . . Asks me,
in a choked voice, to remove a placard

"PROMOTION.''
I.
Once a Company was started by a few
Of the sharpest City folk you ever knew,
And a big success was scored,
With a Peer upon the Board
(Who had nothing in particular to do).
By abundant advertising
Applications were surprising,
And the letters of allotment and regret
Were sent out in several batches,
Which were followed by despatches
Of the most astounding profits they would
net.
The promoters filled their pockets,
And the shares went up like rockets,
For the public didn't understand the trick,
That the thing was over-loaded,
And in time must be exploded;
After soaring like a rocket it would come
down like a stick 1
II.
All announcements looked so absolutely
true,
That it rapidly in public favour grew;
Directly it was floated
By jobbers it was quoted
At a premium—(seventeen to twenty-two).
At this boom unprecedented
Speculators were demented,
But that prem ium still continued to expand;
It got more and more inflated,
The directorate, elated,
Said, "Our riches even beat the Rand."
Still promoters filled their pockets,
Still the shares went up like rockets,
Still people were bamboozled by the trick;
And messages were coded :—
"We 're auriferously loded,
It's a great financial rocket to which
everyone should stick."
III.
Their Statutory Meeting then fell due
(In accordance with the Act—that is the
new).
They conducted business formal,
They made promises abnormal,
And said they'd put the "bears" into a
stew.
Next the Chairman was rewarded
(And the office boy applauded),
For there really seemed a plethora of cash.
But at this important juncture
To the bubble came a puncture,
And the whole thing went to everlasting
smash.
The promoters filled their pockets
(On the Stock Exchange were dockets),
For now the public realised the trick;
To selling they were goaded,
So they rapidly unloaded;
Of the splendour of the rocket there was
nothing save the stick.

AN OLD SONG.
(Set to New Facts.)
When swallows dart to catch the gnats,
And midges swarm around our hats,
When moths are captured by the bats,
And flowers perfume the way,
We love to fly from daily care
To breathe the sneezious country air;
Our cambric handkerchiefs we bring.
And sniff and sneeze like anything
Amid the new-mown hay.
There's room for all, whoe'er they be,
Who have a turn for heartless glee,
And snigger, "Bless you," when they see
Us turn our heads away.
Then join the sport, good men and true,
And maidens sweet with eyes so blue;
Come youth, come ago, come children fair,
And blow your noses in despair,
Amid the new-mown hay.
SENTI-MENTAL.
["The reign of physical beauty in woman is,
according to M. Mabcel Pbevost, the French
novelist, now over. The mind, it seems, is what
is revered nowadays, and that is the reason that
such women as Mrs. Gladstone, Mrs. KRUQF.n,
Mrs. Botha, Mrs. De Wet, and the Countess
Toistoi are most revered."—St. James's Gazette
Sing no more of winsome faces,
Roguish laughter, courtly graces,
Flashing arms
And roseate charms,
Sure your taste In song disgraces.
Sing no more of eyes entrancing,
Nor the love-light in them dancing,
Silken lashes,
Radiant flashes,
Be no more their spells advancing.
Foolish he who fondly lingers
O'er a maiden's shapely fingers;
Shoulders dimply
Sung are simply
By the most degenerate singers.
Cease henceforward, foolish lover,
Aught in beauty to discover;
You must spurn all
Charms external,
Carnal beauty's reign is over.
If you must sing, sing discreetly,
Taking care to waive completely
Skin-deep beauty
That refute ye,
Tho' it strike your senses sweetly.
Sing the femalo disposition
With a mental acquisition;
Charm cerebral,
So integral
Till the chop-and-change transition.
Sing the maid revered for reason.
For ourselves, we 're out of season
We must go hence,!
Keeping silence,
'Less we be accused of treason.

PRESS AND DEPRESS.
"Now, you don't like papers," said my
uncle, trilling a little melody from a light
opera. "A great mistake, my boy.
Everybody ought to spend an hour a
day with the newspapers. They depress
you? Contain nothing but vague reports?
Nonsense, boy. You're not well. Slug-
gish life, sluggish liver."
He repeated the last two words, and
opened one of the morning papers. I
never remembered seeing him]'
look so well and jolly. In the
pink of condition.
"Besides," he continued,
looking over the top of the
paper, "it stimulates one's
thoughts, sets in motion a
train of ideas that carry one
through the day. A mental
tonic, my boy, that's what
our daily paper is, a mental
tonic, to be easily taken with
our coffee and baoon and eggs.
Ha! ha!" he looked at me
again with an expression of
triumph. "My boy, listen to
this. Lord Avebury, on the
British Press, 'said he be-
lieved there was no country in
tho world which had a better
or a brighter litcraturo than
England. You sec, it would
brighten you up, my boy.
Nothing but other people's
misfortunes? Piddle - sticks!
You 're hipped. Now, I '11 just
prove to you how entertaining
and refreshing a morning
paper is. What tone, what
verve, what vigour," here my
uncle mildly saluted his chest
with his right hand, "a perusal
imparts to the system."
He glanced at the leading
article, and began reading:
"' From tho melancholy array
of blue books and volumes of
statistics issued at the close
of the nineteenth century wo
are unhappily brought face to
face with the very mournful
truth that, as a nation, wo aro on the
down grade.' Ah! well, that's uninter-
esting. One never reads that sort of
thing. Some croaking dyspeptic." His
eye reverted from the leading article
to another column. "Ah! now, my boy,
1 read haphazard. 'In a current num-
ber of one of our foremost scientific
magazines, we are confronted with the
alarming statement that our coal supply
cannot last for ever. A time must come
when'"—my uncle's voice faltered—
"' nothing but the tax on it will remain!'
Pooh! pooh! a scare. These things will
creep into the best regulated paper." A
shade of annoyance crossed his face.
"Now, look here. Shipping Notes. 'The
news that the American Syndicate has
actually bought out one of our largest
shipping lines is quite sufficient to fill
every British breast with apprehension as
to the future of our marine commerce.
In every department the Americans are
outbuying us. At no distant date we
anticipate tho flotation of "Britain,
Limited," by a syndicate of enterprising
Yankees.' Dear, dear I" said my uncle,
slowly.
The cheery tone had disappeared. His

are—are furnished with muzzle-loaders—
of the time of Nelson.' And to think of
the sum expended yearly, the taxes, the
constant calls "My uncle's words
failed him. His face was almost haggard.
I would have begged him to desist. But
ho grasped the paper, more determined
than ever to convince me what a cheerful
companion a daily newspaper was.
"Turn to the Army," he said. Then
he docided he would not, as lie caught
sight of the headline: "Is Our Army
worth the Khaki it is clothed
in?" Ho turned the paper
again: "England's Trade, a
Study in Retrogression." He
moaned audibly, and folded
the article down out of sight.
His eye lighted on an adver-
tisement. "'To-morrow You
May Have a Fit!'" he read,
and shivered. He folded the
paper again, and in thick black
letters was informed that "Few
People Have Sound Lungs."
Tho "mental tonic" slipped
from my uncle's knees on to
tho floor. Ho looked worn
out, and coughed in a tenta-
tive manner. "My chest has
been rather troublesome
lately," ho affirmed mildly. "I
wonder if my lungs "and
stretched down for tho paper.
But I had kicked it away. I
trilled lightly the melody my
uncle had begun his remarks
with, and raising my coffee
oup, said, in a spirit of mock
gravity, "To the British Press,
tho brightest in tho world!
What tone, what verve, what
vigour a perusal—imparts to

My undo laughed in his old
delightful manner. He saw the

brow puckered. He turned over a page.
"Now, then, page three. British Navy.
Now, my boy, our glorious Navy. Surely
that has some interest for you." Ho
read, not, 1 believe, without an uncom-
fortable foreboding. "'During the last
few months we have made it perfectly
clear to our readers, by our Speoial
Investigator's articles, how very far from
satisfactory is the state of our Navy.
Half the number of vessels which go to
make-up our powerful Fleet are either
not built or only in the first stages of
building, and of the rest all those with
modern armaments have leaky boilers,

again—" 'all the ships with reliable boilers

her teeth rows of pearls. Sho glided

Then the bird opened his beak and

Naiads of back-waters, willows and locks.
Dainty town daughters in open-worked bodices,
Convoyed by cousins in piqu6 so spick,
Rosy-cheeked, brown-fingered, jimp water-goddesses
Fleeing the district of mortar and brick.
Ladies excitable scuttling and scampering,
Laughing with glee as they rush to and fro,
Groups of old stagers, their quick footsteps hampering,
Wondering why they are hurrying so.

In the long queue at the ticket-box hustling,
Waiting for tickets to bear them afar.

Slaughter of hearts in an innocent way,
Actors and actresses, shorn of their mummery,

OUE BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Grip of the Book Maker (Hutchinson) will be extended to
the ordinary reader, who will find himself held in it till the end
of the last chapter. There is, of course, nothing new in the
leading idea of the book—a young man with educational and
social advantages purchased with the money of a well-meaning
but illiterate and, on the whole, undesirable parent. With a
variation it is the foundation of what my Baronite regards as
one of the two best, the one least widely known, of Dickens's
novels. That is the only point of resemblance with Great
Expectations. Mr. Percy White goes his own way, and a
pleasant one it proves, with his sketches of high life in London,
designed on the whole to make persons of lower estate content
with their lot.
Souvenir of Sir Arthur Sullivan (George Newnes) is perhaps
not the best title Mr. Walter Wells (no relation to John
Wellington of that clan) might have chosen. More especially
in this connection is it suggestive of those not too-costly gifts
managers of theatres present to the audience on the fiftieth, or,
happier still, the hundredth night of the performance of the
piece. Apart from this minor criticism the work is well don
and beautifully printed. The sketch of the life and works of
dear Arthur, a man whom to know was to love, is considerably
added to by a series of illustrations, including photographs of
MY SPORTING LIFE: A RETROSPECT;
Or, Gambling Parsonified.
Those who imagined that the last 'sporting parson' had disappeared
from the Church of England are quite mistaken, for in this week's Church
Times a clergyman who boldly adopts the time-honoured pseudonym writes
a long letter asking whether gambling is really a sin, and he comes to the
conclusion that it is not. ... As an undergraduate he used to attend New-
market out of sheer love of horsellesh, and at the University Steeplechases
he and his friends frequently made bets, and the reckoning up of their gains
and losses added much to the fun of the day. Same with cards—always for
small Bums."—Daily Telegraph, July 23.]
Though Time has taught me something of discretion,
And on my blooming cheek has pressed a finger,
I do not blush to make the small confession
That still I love to let fond mem'ry linger
O'er former days when I, a verdant scholar—
A Church of England minister prospective—
Was wont to back my fancy for a dollar.
Ah! happy is the habit retrospective.
What were the Muses nine? What were the Graces,
Ecclesiastic tutoring and knowledge,
To one fair day spent at the Steeplechases,
So warmly patronised by our college?
My love of horseflesh so predominated
My taste for Christian creeds or heathen gods,
That to accept I never hesitated
A smallish bet at rather longish odds.
Ah! happy day, when from the race returning.
Our several gains and losses then we reckoned,
Ah, joy! to such as with an eye discerning
Ne'er backed a horse to win that came in second.
Ah! who will say that I had ta'en a ramble
Within the precincts of a wicked sinner?
1 think myself 1 did not wrong to gamble—
I always toddled home a tidy winner.
And oh! the days before a parson's choker
Proscribed in some degree my love of gaming,
Those cosy little parties of draw poker!
Myself 1 really cannot think of blaming.
Except on one occasion when a bluffer
By standing pat on nothing proved a winner,
The limit best—I went out like a duffer—
I should have seen him. Then I was a sinner!
Those days are gone; but still I am not lacking
In those proclivities which folk call sporting,
My fancy still occasionally backing,
Altho' to methods different resorting.
Instead of taking odds at Goodwood races,
Or making little books on the regattas,
1 speculate upon the pairs of braces
1 'in likely to receive, and such like matters.

I.
A LADY somewhat pasaie wants to play the juvenile,
(And as Juliet or .Rosalind to lead).
So will practiso by the hour winsome way and sunny smile,
And she finds a deal of practising they need.
She 's matronly ingenuous and flits across the stage
In delightful seventeen's seductive way;
But through your opora-glasses you can estimate her age—
And you swear that " she is forty, if a day."
Rouge, hare's-foot, powder-puff and dye,
A wig, of ruddy gold, she '11 buy,
(With other kinds of panoply essential to her art).
She will fancy both her acting
And appearance are attracting,
And think she looks perfection when she's made up for the
part.
II.
You may have met a City man who boasts about his yacht;
At Cowes he points it out—and you admire.
He says his "soul's in racing," but you 're confident 'tis not,
Though he struts in Comic Opera sea attire.
Ho always is romancing of the perils of the deep,
Of a cyclone ho encountered in the Bay;
As you 've seen him on a Calais boat it sounds a trifle steep,
For before you 'd reached Mid-Channel he looked grey.
He's quite aware the restless sea
Does not agree with such as he,
So from the Esplanade or pier will rarely make a start,
But dressed in serge (with buttons brass),
He '11 keenly eye the weather glass,
And think he looks perfection when he's made up for the
part.
HI.
If a fussy little tradesman, in a neighbourhood effete,
As Mayor of Borough Council gets elected,
He soon begins to fancy that his brains aro hard to beat,
Though hitherto they've never been detected.
As patron of Suburbia he '11 proudly stroll about,
(He is something now beyond the common clay);
But for acme of amusement you ought to hear him " spout "—
A performance quite as good as any play.
He wants a chain and badge to wear,
Some footmen tall, with powdered hair,
A gilded coach, with coat of arms, to supersede the cart,
A robe—he '11 simply grab it
(It is red and trimmed with rabbit),
And think he looks perfection when he's made up for the
part. Huan MEE.

July 1st to 5th.—" And -where shall -we go for our summer
elopement this year, dearest?" said Jocelyn, as they stood
locked in each other's arms. "Would Nuremberg suit you?"
"What route do you propose?" asked Rosabel, suddenly
practical, and extricating herself from his grasp.
"I suggest the Hook of Holland and the Rhine to Mayence.
Have you any prejudices in the matter?"
"How do you get to the Hook of Holland?"
"By the Great Eastern, from Liverpool Street to Harwich.
But why this unwomanly regard for detail? I hardly know
you, Rosabel, in this new attitude."
"Is Liverpool Street the only starting-point for Harwich?"
She insisted with a strange perseverance.
"Rosabel, Rosabel, you have changed surprisingly since
our last elopement. Is it the influence of your second
marriage? You never talked like this before. You were
"never importunate about termini. Can you have lost your old
confidence in mo?"
"Never, never! But we must be frank with one another,
and face the truth. We shall have many embarrassments to
contend with in our coming irregular career; let us not
anticipate them; let us at least hold together, you and I. Is
Liverpool Street the only starting-point for Harwich?"
"Yes, a thousand times yes. And now kindly explain."
A sigh of satisfaction escaped from ROSABEL. "Dearest,"
she said, "between those who love no explanation should be
needed. But I too will be frank with you. I have not lived
this long, weary time apart from you without growing older
and knowing more of the world. Never again, with my eyes
open, will I elope with anyone on a system with alternative
routes, such as the Chatham and South-Eastern. Have you
already forgotten the fiasco of our first elopement? How it fell
through, as it were, between two stools—namely, Victoria and
Charing Cross? And my first husband lying dead at the time,
and I ignorant of that fait accompli? It is by these little
accidents—an unforeseen change of terminus at the last
moment, for instance—that the entire destinies of two lives
may be permanently bifurcated. But for those alternative
routes we might have reached Marseilles together, read of my
first husband's death in the papers, got married at the con-
sulate, and been an honest man and woman ever afterwards."
"'Honest,' Rosabel? What is this new talk of technical
virtue, based on signatures before witnesses? Do you, after
all, regret the step we are once more taking in defiance of
social tradition? Ce n'est que le premier pas qui co&te. This is
the second of the kind."
"No, my love, I am not drawing back. But a second elope-
ment, even with the same man, can never be quite the same
thing. The first prompt, instinctive glow is irrevocably gone.
One becomes rational, almost worldly in one's unworldliness.
But my mind is fixed; I shall not fail you. To-night, then, at
Liverpool Street, for the Hook." (She smiled a little patheti-
cally at this unpremeditated pleasantry). "You will get the
tickets—single tickets, of course. I must go home for my
Church Service and hand-mirror, and to leave a p.p.c. on my
second husband. Remember I Liverpool Street."
John Oliver Hobbes (in The Serious Wooing).
6th to 10th.—It did not fall, gentlemen, within the scope of
my original scheme to confide to you my arrangements for
spending the summer vacation. Never voluntarily will I with-
draw the veil of privacy from my retirement. But having
already admitted my intention of ploughing my furrow alone to
the utter end, I am compelled to throw further light upon my
plans. For, if I am to anticipate, as a contingency, the
prospect of being joined by others in my enterprise, it becomes
necessary for me to define the precise locality of my intended
tilth. Being fully cognisant of the fact that the ordinary
furrow is naturally limited in the opportunities it offers, and
that, while I reserve the freedom of desisting at any moment if
the furrow prove too tedious, I do not wish to consummate my
task prematurely, I have felt bound to select a field of practi-
cally boundless range. The Sahara occurred to me as answering
to this description.
I propose, therefore, in the full heat of July, to issue from
tlie site of Carthage, whose ruins were once sat upon by
Marius (an historical figure that has always had a poignant
interest for me), and plough, with the permission of the French
and other Governments, in a southerly direction, with Cape
Town for my objective; thus covering in a bee-line the entire
length of the Dark Continent. Of the adaptability of much
of the soil to the uses of the plough I am uncertain: but I
have confidence that at least the Sahara will provide the kind
of material with which our Liberal implements are familiar.
If I fail to get to the Cape Colony alive, my friends will be good
enough to attribute that misfortune rather to my own hardihood
than to any neglect on the part of the Foreign and Colonial
Offices. Beyond that point, if I meet with the enemy, I shall
plead non-combatancy, and, if detained a prisoner, shall send
for my books. Assuming that I reach my ultimate destination
in solitude, I shall return to my library by the next steamer.
And, finally, if I attain my end in company of others, I really
cannot tell you what will ensue, as I am myself at present in
ignorance of the proper sequel to such a juncture. Understand
that I crave the company of none; but in case my movements
should be matter for curiosity to any prospective supporter, the
Sahara will find me until further intimation. RoSEBERY.
11th, 12th.—To the glazed eye, dull with yearlong routine,
and avid of colour and incident, Yarmouth brings relief with the
bronze of her bloaters. On your seaward breakfast-table they
lie, a point of diurnal pungency; eloquent, too, of suggestion.
Salt, that was the breath of their life, is the stuff of their
embalming. Not here, in the trite phrase, was death the cure of
ill, save for a brief interspace. Then that which gave its savour
to existence was itself made the cure of death, last ill of all.
That is why Yarmouth, for all its pier and sable minstrelsy, is
still the inviolable hermitage of tired hearts. Its salt is some-
thing better than Attic. It breathes, as Athens never wholly
breathed in her prime, the continuity of existence. It is vocal
with the rhythm of death cured and corrected.
Alice Mkynell.
18th TO 17th.—" I want a new place to be a hero in!" The
speaker ended, as he began, abruptly. Silence is golden, but
the next best thing is that your words should be fit and few.
He was a strong man, but his eye had the quiet reserve
that may sometimes be found with strength, a combination
always attractive. There were lines, too, about his mouth that
revealed a capacity for pathos as well as humour.
None of these characteristics, except perhaps his strength (a
dangerous thing if allied to madness), imposed itself upon the
observation of the young man whom he addressed—a clerk in
the office of Messrs. Gaze, Catchem and Cook.
"Is it a holiday tour you want?" he asked, tentatively.
"Mention a few novelties," replied the strong, quiet man.
"We are booking a good deal for tho interior of Turkey,"
said tho clerk.
"Fought at Plevna," replied the strong, quiet man.

have his meals alone. His food is far more likely
to agree with him when partaken of in company.]
Sweet ! * though a word from you would
bind
My future and your own much closer,
You have not yet made up your mind
Whether to answer'' Yes " or " No, Sir!"
Let it be " Yes," for here indeed
Is reason good for you to chance it;
Be influenced by what you read
Among the columns of the Lancet.
"Man should not take his meals alone!"
This stated[as a simple'fact is.
If you '11 consent to be my own,
We '11 put this precepti into practice.
Though little love you have to spare,
Why not let pity solve the question?
For, only think, my lady fair,
How you can help my poor digestion I
At breakfast-time—supposing that
This charitable job you take on—
No longer shall I dread the fat
That usually surrounds my bacon.
Though eggs be stale, yet who shall note
Of discontent the slightest whisper?
You '11 help the coffee down my throat,
And make my toast seem all the crisper.
At dinner, too, your charming face
Will make a difference surprising;
In the 7iors d'ozuvres I'm sure to trace
A flavour far more appetising.
Sou]), flsh and joint will all entice,
Though feeble be the cook's resources;
And I shall dream of Paradise
Before I've finished half the courses.
Then, later on, your presence still
Shall haunt me like some gay enchanter,
And hover round each glass I All
From out the trustworthy decanter.
For nothing then will disagree,
Dyspepsia won't make me shiver.
Oh, bo my bride, and you will see
How Love shall triumph o'er the Liver I

Scene—A Publisher's Sanctum.
Chorus of Authors.
IN" these enlightened days
Of taste and culture rare,
When souly School Boards raise
Their standards everywhere,
When ignorance is dead,
And vulgar folly dumb,
And pupil teachers shed
Refinement on the slum;
When babes that scarce can walk
Are taught to sing and dance,
And oven learn to talk
The dainty»tongue of Prance;
Our work is sure to find
Appreciative praise
From every cultured mind
In these enlightened days.
First Author. A humble poet I
That spent my eager youth
In seeking after Truth—
I sought her low and high.
Through fortune good and ill
One passion filled my heart—■
To mingle Truth with Art,
And show her truthful still.
My'days among the dead,
The deathless dead, were past;
With them my lot was cast,
Their mighty minds I read.
Athenian Sophocles
And Shakspeare, fancy's child,
Warbling his woodnotes wild—
My boon companions these.
And now a humble play,
The fruit of toilful years,
I bring with hopes and fears,
And at thy feet]I lay.
Publisher. A Shakspearian play? Oh, take it away!
It's the very last thing that one needs.
Demand there is none, for Shakspeare is one
That nobody now-a-days reads.
It's dull, stodgy stuff—not sensation enough—
Too poetical—calls for some brains.
A man who will write in blank verse gives you quite
Unsuitable reading for trains.
First An. Then you decline my drama?
Pub. Yes, I do;
It's quite unsaleable. Now, what have you?
Second An. No SHAKSPEARE I. With humbler pen
I only seek to tell
The follies and the faults of men
That round about me dwell;
To paint them as in truth they are,
Wise, foolish, grave and gay—
Content to follow from afar
My master Thackeray.
Pub. My thanks to you! Pray, don't undo
Your parcel; there's no reason!
Remember, please, such works as these
Are wholly out of season.
Such stuff as that to-day falls flat;
The public want more savour.
Take my advice, and give them spice
With lots and lots of flavour.

And list to me a minute—

TO MY QUEEN—OF THE KOSES.
(At a Rose Show.)
Roses in dazzling dresses
Shook out their perfumed tresses,
Such glory ne'er was seen.
In trembling odour swaying,
Their blooming charms displaying,
Each claimed to bo the queen,
Their sweets about did fling
In inter-whispering
Their title to bo queen.
And ne'er among the flowers
Born of the golden hours
Was such sweet turmoil seen.
In midst whereof my queen
Was by the roses seen;
Their titles all they hushed.
And at the lovely sight
Grew many roses white,
And other roses blushed.
THE ANTI-GREEN PARK.
MisterPunch, my Distinguished Friend
and Colleague,—I ask your pardon to
address you. I have now been in your
great city for many years, and although I
know the Vauxhall Bridge Road and
Leicester Square better than the other
parts, still I feel able to advise you.
You are about to spend some millions
of francs in altering your Green Park.
Good! But let it be done wisely. I hear
your present intention is to take a slice
of Piccadilly and make it road, leaving a
narrow neck at Hyde Park Corner, and
another narrow neck at your street of
St. James. Is this wise? I say No, a
thousand times No! Why do you not
imitate the Continent—as you call all
Europe save your own little island—in
this direction? Why should there not be
a road (like that in the Champs Elysees)
for the children? Why should not Mr.
Punch himself appear in his own show?
He might be accompanied by Madame and
the dog, and—for a while—by the baby.
It would be delightful, and how pleased
the children would be! And why not
cafes? And even a Eursaal might be
established like the excellent one just
started at Southend. Roads might be
made here, there, and everywhere. It
would not cost much if the land had not
to be purchased. And there might be a
garden for strange animals—like the one
in the Bois de Boulogne. I have been
told—and I do not think he that gave the
story was what you call pulling my leg—
that there is already a Jardin d'acclima-
tation in the Park of St. James. Why
not bring it to your Green Park?
Above all, there is a blot which should
be removed. Away with your Vilainton!
He is too much!
Receive my consideration the most
distinguished.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 22.—Small
minds disposed to scoff when, the vision
of the housemaid crossing the Markiss's
eye, ho thinks it worthy of mention in the
High Court of Parliament. Profounder
students of human nature will find in it a
charming note of domesticity flecking the
purple of the Premiership. However it
be, the topic and cognate matters are
irresistible. Nothing seemed more un-
likely in Lords tc-night than that the
Premier would make a speech that should
overcome his predecessor's indisposition
to interpose in public affairs.
A sultry afternoon; less than two score
Peers present. First business, motion by
Stanmore to re-establish the Fine Arts
Commission of 1842. Premier dozed on
till Stanmore, after some talk about
pictures, began, as the Markiss put it,
to tell us of stains on various carpets, to
criticise certain wall-paper. Promptly
rising when Stanmore made an end of
speaking, the Markiss eagerly said,
"I quite sympathise with the wish of the
noble lord that all wall-paper should be
pretty and all carpets should be clean.
But the point is, what js the remedy, what
is the mode of achieving this end?"
Then Stanmore insisted there was
delicate ironwork to be made, dainty
wood-carving to be achieved. "These
things," continued the Markiss, shaking
his head, "are, I think, calculated to
send a cold shudder down the back of the
Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. They," he
added in hollow voice, "can bo attained
only by expenditure of money. Why want
such a Commission? "Why part with the
supervision of Parliament, or the executive
power of the Government in matters of
art?"
On this a vision in turn crossed the
active mind of Lord Rosebery. '' 1 should


"The Mnrkiss's eje slowly roved over the
benches opposite."
be very sorry," he said, "to see the noble
Markiss followed by a staff, passing
through the Private View of the Royal
Academy with a marked catalogue in his
hand, noting the purchases ho intends to
make on behalf of the public."
Another vivid picture flashed by Rose-
bery through the half empty House was
hung on a peg supplied by Stanmore'S
suggestion that portraits of leading
statesmen should adorn the walls of
Parliament. "I think," he said, "there
would be an invidiousness about hanging
statesmen in this House."
The Markiss, preparing to go to sleep
again, woke up; his eye slowly roved
over the Benches opposite. He did not
say anything, but there was that in his
expressive countenance which indicated
he did not go the full length of the noble
Earl's statement. As a rule the proposi-
tion was sound; but there are possible
exceptions to every rule.
Business done.—In Commons, after brisk
debate, Prince Arthur carries motion
suspending Twelve o'clock Rule for rest
of Session. Says there is no need for
Prorogation to be deferred beyond 17th.
"Begorra, we'll see about that," say
the Irish Members, whose well-earned
increment is calculated at rate per diem,
and does not run through the recess.
Tuesday night.—It is a tradition at the
Treasury that during Reginald Earle
Welby, K.C.B.'s term of office as Per-
manent Secretary, whenever estimates
were submitted from any of the spending
Departments, ho responded, "Can't you
cut 'em down?" Conspicuous ability,
high service to the State, leading to a
peerage, question arose as to what title
he would select. Colleagues at the
Treasury were prompt and unanimous in
suggestion. Lord Cut-'EM-Down was
obvious. The new Peer, avoiding the
picturesque, was satisfied with ennobling
his family name, and as Lord "Welby has
through seven years suffered the pangs of
silence in House of Lords. "What the
discipline must have been to him his
many friends will know.
To-night broke the spell. Delivered
luminous speech on condition of national
expenses. Through it all ran the old
refrain, " Cut 'em down."
The Markiss evidently impressed. "I
am not an agricultural labourer," Bobby
Spencer once remarked, standing at Table
of House of Commons in immaculate morn-
ing costume. Said the Markiss, "I
have only a very lay and uninstructed
intelligence to bring to bear on the
accumulated learning which many years
of distinguished public service have
enabled the noblo lord to gather."
Thus the Markiss, rising, as it were,
to propose a vote of thanks to the learned
lecturer. "What " a very lay intelligence"
may be is not immediately clear. It finds
its parallel in Cap'en Tommy Bowles's
remark the other night in another place.
"I rose very largely," he said, "to give
the Under - Secretary for Foreign
Affairs an opportunity to explain."
Prince Arthur, beginning to think that
we can have too much even of the Cap'en,
privately expressed a hope that the old
salt would be content to present himself
at question time in his usual size. That
the Markiss, master of phrases, should
have blundered on a faulty one is striking
testimony to impression wrought by Lord
Welby's discourse.
Business done.—In Commons, Lowther,
J. W., back after week's absence in

The Henley Division.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
company of gout. A hearty cheer from both
sides paid tribute to his successful admi-
nistration of a difficult and delicate post.
Closure once more possible, Committee on
Education Bill brisked up wonderfully.
Last week Hart-Dyke rather let fly at
the blameless John 0' Gorst; accused
him in so many words of playing the banjo
whilst national school-houses were burn-
ing. To-night, influenced by example at
Reform Club, withdrew everything he had
said; apologised; held out right hand of
reconciliation; couldn't have behaved
handsomer had JOHN 0' Gorst been a
Liberal Leader, and he one of the " con-
spirators '' among the party darkly alluded
to by C.-B. and SQUIRE OF Malwood.
This led up to proposal that Prince
Arthur should accept amendment moved
by Mather from Opposition Benches limit-
ing operation of Bill to prolonging statu
quo for twelve months. Never in his life
was Prince Arthur so amazed, so pained.
What! Should a Ministry of which he
was a member, of whose views he was
authorised exponent, display this weak-
ness in face of enemy? His Majesty's
Government had brought in Education
Bill embodying a distinct principle, framed
on definite lines. To withdraw it, to
abandon it, to substitute an alternative,
would be to display a weakness that
would stamp them as incapable of dealing
with so grave a question as national
education.
Squire of Malwood, who remembers
history of Education question under the
Markiss's Government, softly laughed.
Crowded Committee looked on in ad-
miration at Prince Arthur's indignant
gestures, his flashing eyes, his anger-
crimsoned cheeks.
"Upon my word," said James Bryce, a
plain Aberdeen body, "1 do think he
believes he has not within the last few
years twice stood at that very box and
abandoned two Education Bills a few
months earlier introduced from the
Treasury Bench, with trumpets also and
shawms."
Thursday night. — What was the Lord
Great Chamberlain going to do with the
benches, the scarlet cloth coverings, the
canopy over the chair of the Lord High
Steward, and eke the door mats that
furnished forth the Royal Gallery for the
trial of Earl Russell by his peers?
Something sad in meditation on the
matter. Here was the heir of a historic
name on trial for felony. The Peers of
the United. Kingdom, arrayed in 'scarlet
cloaks, sat in pained silence. The Lord
High Chancellor, a square cap stuck on
top of his wig lending a crowning grace
to his presence, was throned in state.
The formula, closely studied, was strictly
followed. It was a page reverently
removed from early English history, and
set among the magazines, the newspapers,
the extra-specials of "the twentieth
century. A solemn, stately pageant,
carrying the mind back to Plantagenet
times.
And here was the Lord Great Chamber-
lain, narrowly examining the texture of
the crimson cloth, in his mind's eye
measuring the matting, smacking his lips
over the canopy above the chair of the
Lord High Steward, reckoning up how
much they would fetch in the market.
They were all his; perquisites belonging
to his high office. As soon as the trial
was over, when John Stanley, Earl
Russell, was led forth, to the stake at
Smithfleld or to the chop in Holloway
Gaol as the sentence might direct, the
Lord Great Chamberlain's varlets could
swoop down on the rich carpets, the
rare red cloth, and bear it away.
But as on a historical occasion Ran-
dolph Churchill '' forgot Goschen," so the
Lord Great Chamberlain forgot Akers-
Douglas. Story out to-night at Question
time. "Where," Swift MacNeil, envious,
asked, "are the benches, the scarlet
cloth covering, and the canopy of the
Lord High Steward?"
"The fittings, &c," said the First Com-
missioner of Works (note the bloodless
"&c." in this connection) "are still in
my possession. They have been claimed
by the Lord Great Chamberlain, but I
have disallowed the claim."
And there was an end of the matter.
"What pale, puling creatures we have
become in this so-called twentieth cen-
tury," says Sark. "Had Ancaster's
forbear, the Lord Willoughby who fought
under Edward the First, yearned after
this red cloth and these wooden benches,
he would have just looked in and taken
them, running Akers - Douglas through
the body 'if he said him nay. Under
Edward the Seventh the First Commis-
sioner of Works holds up his hand, and
the Lord Great Chamberlain slinks away
to write a postcard to Whiteley's to say
they needn't send for the things.
Business done. — The Lord Great
Chamberlain's little game stopped by
the First Commissioner of Works.
WHAT THE SAD SEA WAVES ARE
SAYLNG.
At Aguehoe.—Avoid this "abode for the
convalescent" if you wish to escape the
doctor on your return to town.
At Swindleborough-on-Sea.—Beware of
the hotel " extras " and the bath in your
own room at two shillings a day.
At Coffin-super-Mare.—Make your will
and send it to your lawyer, and then
choose a spotjn the local cemetery.
At "the favourite watering-places" gene-
rally.—That you won't have much comfort
unless you have a long purse. And even
if you are a millionaire, you will find
furnished apartments nothing like home,
sweet home.'
"CHINA MENDED."
Apropos of the report that Chinese
"progressives " intend to so far conform
to Western customs as to start a popular
newspaper in Hu-Nan embodying the
"latest ideas in journalism," a few ex-
tracts from the Editor's diary might
prove of interest:—

And be ready in a moment for the next.
Then, O man, be not dejected!

You will find that five poor shillings
Make the sorrow's crown of which the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUE CLUB.
It is well known that the king can do no
wrong. It is almost equally well known
—at least, in clubs—that no House Commit-
tee can do anything right. Our House
Committee is no exception to the rule.
For a long time there had been com-
plaints of draughts upon our staircase.
After considering these for months our
House Committee
at last decided to
put up a new swing
door. They waited
till the winter was
over and till tjhe
chilly spring was
well advanced, and
then they began.
For days and days
we, the members,
fell over recum-
bent workmen,
bags of tools, and
such things, in
dark corners of the
hall; the early
morning brought
sounds of hammer-
ing, and unex-
pected bangs dis-
turbed the calm
silence of the
afternoon. At last
the door was there,
a seemingly in-
offensive, glazed,
swing door. Then
it was at once dis-
covered that the
hinges had been
put at the wrong
side, with the re-
sult that members
going in one direc-
tion walked into
the fireplace, and
in the other stum-
bled down the
back stairs.
So the House
Committee con-
sidered the whole
thing once more,
the recumbent
workmen, the bags of tools, the hammer-
ings and the bangs came back again, and
the door made its re-appearance with the
hinges altered. Meanwhile the weather
was gradually getting warmer, and the
members forgot the draughts. We all
said, of course, that the House Committee
was wrong, and that the door should have
been put up in August, when the Club is
always closed and cleaned. But the
House Committee, having started that
door, devoted all their energy to the
completion of it. By degrees it was
painted; it was provided with handles
and finger-plates, and, finally, a spring of
superhuman force having been affixed, it
was completed. The great work of our
House Committee, the masterpiece of
those sublime intellects, was achieved.
Still we were not satisfied. By this
time the weather had become so hot at
intervals that wo pined for draughts.
We remembered the refreshing currents of
air which had prevailed all the winter,
and wore now shut out by the pig-

headed obstinacy of our House Com-
mittee.
But our sufferings did not end there,
and our grumblings only began. The
force of the spring on that door was so
great that it needed three of the largest
of us, or half-a-dozen small members, to
hold the door open. One day Tomkins
rushed hastily out to welcome a lady
visitor in the hall, and as he passed the
demon door caught his coat and held him
immovable. Members and waiters rushed
to his assistance. They could not move
his coat without opening the door, and
they could not open the door without
tearing the tails off his coat. They had to
pull him out of his garment, and he weut
to the lady in a friend's overcoat that
didn't fit him.
After this we thought that door would
be altered again, but it wasn't, and
shortly after one of us let it go un-
expectedly, for he had not the strength
lo hold it open, and it hit another member
on the head, raising such a bump that
he could not wear
| a stiff hat for a
| fortnight.
Then timid'mem-
bers, especially
after dark, got in
the habit of going
up the front stair-
case and coming
down the back
one, merely to
avoid that door.
One powerful mem-
ber, fighting with
it, had a new hat
knocked off and
utterly ruined.
Another, a small,
new member, was
so battered about
in his first attempt
I to get through
that he has never
come to our Club
again.
At last our suffer-
I ings ended. The
| other day a'fmem-
ber of the House
Committee was
caught by that
door and his little
finger was scrat-
ched. An extra-
ordinary meeting
of the House Com-
mittee was imme-
diately summoned;
they- deliberated
for nine hours and
three - quarters,
and then ordered
up a bundle of
firewood. One of
them, incredibly
reckless, tried to tackle the demon door
single-handed. In the twinkling of an
eye he was swept round a corner, flung
down the back staircase, and picked up
more dead than alive in the basement.
Then the remainder of House Committee,
flung themselves on the demon door and
held it back, while a page-boy slipped a
wedge of firewood underneath it.
Thus at last we were freed from that
wooden tyrant, and it now stands, always
open, helpless and forgotten. But the
Club will have to pay for it all the same.
So, you see, our House Committee is no
better than any other. H. D. B.

[July 31, 1901.

No, this isn't a collection of Tubercular Microbes escaping from this Congress;
BUT MERELY THE MONTGOMERY-SMITHS IN THEIR MOTOR-CAB, ENJOYING THE BEAUTIES OF
THE COUNTRY.
DER SCHNELL-ZUG.
If you want to And a really slow train
try the express of the K.k. priv. Siidbahn
Oesellschaft from Innsbruck to Toblach
in the Tyrol. The distance, according to
the infallible Baedeker, is 90J miles, and
the journey takes flvo hours. A Spanish
oxpress could hardly beat this. Even
the Imperial Royal Private Southrailway
Company may not be able to run a train
very fast uphill, though they have an
engine to pull and another to push it up
the Brenner Pass, but they might try a
slightly greater speed on the level ground,
and even if the express stopped at every
station like a Spanish express, as it does,
it need not stop long enough for the
engine-driver to smoke several cigarettes,
or the guard to drink a Kaffee mit Obers
with the stationmaster. And this mar-
vellous express, travelling at the astound-
ing average speed of eighteen miles an
hour, is so ingeniously arranged by the K.k.
priv. Siidbahn Oesellschaft that it lands
one at eight in the evening—that is, if it
is only a quarter of an hour late—at the
desolate station of Toblach, immediately
opposite a vast barrack, which is the
hotel owned by the K.k. priv. Siidbahn
Oesellschaft, one of the most uncomfort-
able and, considering its discomfort, one
of the most expensive hotels one could
possibly discover. To the north it com-
mands a magnificent view of the railway
station, with a grass slope beyond, to the
south there is a hill immediately outside
the windows.
In this dismal spot the unhappy tra-
veller, caught in the clutches of the K.k.
priv. Siidbahn Gesellschaft, must spend
his time and his money, especially the
latter, till the next morning, and patiently
consume such tepid soup and other frag-
ments as may remain from the Abendessen
of the very numerous middle-class Aus-
trians who are content to stay en pension
in this huge shed. They are stated, and
they appear, to be mostly Viennese finan-
ciers. Perhaps they prefer to be opposite
a railway station in order to rush off at
once to Vienna if there should be a rise
or fall on the Bourse. Only, as the ex-
presses of the Company would take about
two days, at eighteen miles an hour, to
convey them there, they would probably
arrive too late.
My fellow-traveller in this train was a
courteous and amiable priest, who became
very restless after about five hours, and
paced up and down the little corridor.
In the next compartment there was an
officer, buttoned up in the extremely
tight blue tunic of the Austrians, a tunic
so tight that it suggests stays beneath
it. Whenever the train stopped for an
unusually long time, the priest sought
out the officer and conversed with him.
1 imagine that he found some consolation
in such forcible expressions as the soldier
might apply to the K.k. priv. Siidbahn
Gesellschaft, but which a priest could not
properly use. However, the officer got
out before we reached Toblach, and the
priest was going on to Trieste, with no
one to speak out for him. He told me he
expected to arrive at three o'clock in the
morning. As that was a good many days
ago, I hope his journey is ended by this
time.
It must be admitted that travellers can
avoid this express by taking an equally
slow one at seven in the morning. Then
they can also avoid the hotel. Here the
crafty K.k. priv. Siidbahn Gesellschaft
again shows its ingenuity, for it knows
that most people do not care to start at
that unearthly hour. As for the slow
trains of this Company, one never hears of
them, and I am inclined to believe that
none of them have ever reached their
destination, so that no traveller has
returned to tell what happened—ce qui
arriva—but it certainly could not have
been the train gut arriua.

where the books detailed in his catalogue may be
inspected."—Daily Paper.']
At last the publishers are awake to the
advisability of offering every facility to
the public for a personal inspection of
their new books. We claim a small share
In this welcome innovation, for our readers
know how vigorously we have advocated
in these columns a careful examination of
all books previous to purchase. I know of
nothing more distressing to one's peace
of mind than, after ordering a novel or a
volume of verses from a catalogue, to
receive a clumsy leatherette affair with
an atrocious design executed in the most
hideous colour imaginable. But, thanks
to one or two leading publishers' fore-
sight, such contingencies can be guarded
against.
I spent yesterday morning in turning
over Messrs. Print and Bind'b summer
stock. A little booklet of Essays (I
forget the nature exactly) in a soft shade
of crimson levant, especially took my
fancy. The paper, of a delightful Indian
transparency, yielded deliciously to the
touch and made it quite a pleasure to
turn over the leaves. The type was
singularly clear and graceful, and that
known to printers as "pica." Altogether
a pleasing little book. The novels, 1
noticed, still cling to the elaborate
designs, and I cannot confidently re-
commend any except a couple in a light
terra-cotta buckram, which had a cheer-
ful and generally pleasing get-up. I
forget what they were called and whom
they were written by. The Love-letters
of a Oernuin Gardener, that everyone is
raving about, is bound in an unfortunate
shade of sage-green, and should not be
read by anyone with a pale complexion
—at least, not in public. The cover is
grotesquely ornamented with Japanese
cabbages, which adds in no small degree
to the great vogue which this horto-senti-
mental work has attained. Although, I
must say, I cannot myself see how a great
sale can be looked for while the paper
continues to be of so inferior a quality.
The time has gone by-—and the astutest
of publishers recognise the fact—when
readers are satisfied with any kind of
binding and get-up so long as the contents
are genuinely good. But in these en-
lightened days what we look for and
justly expect is as high a finish to our
literary ornaments as to our tables and
chairs.
Messrs. Papermashey's stock includes
an excellent series of summer novels,
daintily habited in a thoughtful blue.
There is an open-air freshness about them
that cannot but make them exhilarating
companions. For such of our readers
as affect a taste for pale pink, we can
recommend Queen of the Quorn, and
Altruist or Idiot? A word of praise
must be accorded the latest novel by Mr.
Hugo Hughes. It is in automobile red
and is printed with a nice, generous
margin in a distinctly fetching American
type. The "honey-pale" bookmarker
inserted in The Cabman and Corinna is
bound to secure for it a high place in
the summer sales. When you look at Puff
and Boom's holiday goods, don't fail to
notice the little imitation shagreen
bibelot. I must say the so-called Poems
which these little masterpieces in the art
of modern book-binding hold together are
the feeblest nonsense I have come across
for many a long day. But who reads
Poetry nowadays? Anyhow, the ornamen-
tation on the cover has been especially
copied from a design of one of Queen
Anne's pocket-handkerchiefs, and at least
five duchesses have intimated their inten-
tion of having a copy about the house.
I should not bo surprised if this little
sheaf of songs (what a pity they're so
very twaddly) finds a prominent place in
every boudoir in Britain. The binding is
in every way excellent.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Messrs. Hutchinson have issued the second volume of The
Living Races of Mankind, edited by Mr. H. N. Hutchinson, Mr.
Gregory, and Mr. Lydekker. It presents a popular account
of the customs, habits, pursuits, feasts and ceremonies of the
races of mankind throughout the world. It is marked by all
the excellencies noted by my Baronite in review of the first
volume. Whilst the letterpress is bright and informing, the
illustrations, reproduced from photographs, are unique in range
and striking in individuality. Sharper than a library of books
do they bring home to us insulars the personality of our strange
brothers and sisters throughout the wide world. By the way,
on page 431 there is a photograph of a Tollemarken (Sweden)
peasant for which Mr. Gladstone might have sat. In every
detail of feature and contour we have revealed the familiar
face.
Secret Chambers and Hiding Places, by Allan Pea (Bousfteld).
This is a most interesting book; one, however, rather useful to
the historian or historic novelist as one of reference than for
the general reader, who, if on tiptoe of expectation for strange,
wild, weird and exciting stories, would be proportionately dis-
appointed. The author rarely goes into anything like details
of the romantic and fearful facts, though with them he could
have filled several volumes. The illustrations, too, are most
interesting. The ingenuity that invented these hiding places
was something marvellous, the chief inventor dying a martyr;
and as he had passed his life in carefully secreting those
persecuted for conscience' sake, so, during the supremacy of
the unprincipled Cecil, he, true to his latest breath, died
under barbarous torture, a "blessed martyr"—whether canon-
ised or not this deponent cannot say—never breathing one
syllable of all he knew. By "holes" of his devising a con-
siderable number escaped, and, though not actual martyrs, they
were henceforth reckoned as " hole-y men." Also, the author
gives all too brief accounts of smugglers' caves and hiding
places. There is a delightful chapter about Boscobel and
Charles; and there is just such a taste given of the mystery
of Glamis Castle as will make the least curious in such matters
eager for more.
John Topp, Pirate (Methuen), is a right down good story of
the old-fashioned tuppenny-coloured type. That Mr. WeatherbY
Chesney has studied Charles Kingsley, and is familiar with
the works of R. L. Stevenson, is evident. But his work is
none the worse, rather tho better, for that. The scene is laid
in the time and in tho country of Westward Ho 1 The story is
full of blood, thunder, fighting on deck and shore, with inter-
stices filled in by graphic descriptions of the work of the
Spanish Inquisition. It will prove a delight to boys big and
little, and my Baronite, no longer in his teens, has read it with
breathless interest.
"Biographies—No. VII."—His Most Gracious Majesty King
Edward VII., by H. Whates, author of The Third Salisbury
Administration (H. J. DbanE, Salisbury House, Publishers).
Ahem! Everything comes to him who Whates, and the chance
has arrived of which Mr. Whatks has availed himself, and, on
the whole, well and wisely. But—there are lots of "buts" in
it—might it not have been done better and with more wisdom 1
The Baron is unaware what six biographies have preceded this of
the Seventh Edward, His Most Gracious Majesty, nor within
the range of his extensive knowledge does he remember having
previously met with any specimens of these "Bijou Biogra-
phies." Reading the preface, after having perused the little
volume, the Baron is informed thereby that "this little sketch
will excite the disdain of the courtier and the surprise of the
sycophant"; so leaving the courtier and the sycophant to
discuss the matter between them, the Baron, with his hand
upon his heart, is able to say that, having read the "Bijou
Biography," he feels neither surprise nor disdain, and is, on
the whole, about as well as could be expected. It is a handy
book of reference, and, of course, very interesting in the
details of our King's early educational career, especially as
Mr. Punch, ever thoughtful, ever kindly, and truly loyal,
actually interfered for the young Prince's benefit, being
fearful lest all work and very little play should have a bad
effect on our future King. It is pleasant to think that Mr.
Punch's well-timed advice was acted upon. Altogether, it is
so interesting a little work that the author of it will not
be remembered as "Heavy Whates," nor is any portion of it
so frivolous as to suggest the idea of "Light Whates." No,
the Baron fancies the well-balanced writing suggests "Exact
Whates," while its occasional genial and harmonious tone sug-
gests "Christmas W?hates." The Baron de B.-W.
THE LOVESICK LOCOMOTIVE.
'TWAS a dashing locomotive, and it thundered down the line
Ev'ry morning with a corridor express,—
Round a curve or through a tunnel,
Puffing smoke from out the funnel,
On and on,—a mile a minute more or less.
If the signals didn't stop it, it would cut the records fine,
And one day the pace was wonderful to see,
When another engine passed it,
And it realised at last it
Was in love,—about as badly as could be.
You would think a locomotive big and bluff, puff! puff!
Would be proof against all sentimental stuff, puff ! puff!
I'vea theory—though slender—
That, as part of it was " tender,"
It explains the funny conduct of the puff, puff, puff!
Now the other engine drew a humble goods train to and fro,
While the big express went past her ev'ry day,
With its driving wheels a-humming
When it saw that she was coming—
But between them was the horrid six-foot way.
Ev'ry now and then its whistle very loudly it would blow,
But the other took no notice,—not a bit;
So the poor express was troubled,
And it snorted and it bubbled,
For, as I remarked, it was so hardly hit.
And at last it really got into a huff, puff! puff!
For the treatment it received was rather rough, puff! puff!
And it thought, "I '11 have revenge in
Some way suited to an engine,
I will not bo made the plaything of a puff, puff, puff!
"I will get on closer terms with her !" that locomotive cried,
But it found that ev'ry effort seemed to fail;
So one day as it wont gliding
Past the goods train in a siding,
It arranged affairs by running off the rail.
When two very heavy bodies rather suddenly collide,
Something happens, as you 're probably aware;
And a locomotive suffers
From a bang upon the buffers,
And a subsequent explosion in the air.
Now to ev'ry man the moral's plain enough, puff ! puff!
Keep your distance, or you '11 meet with a rebuff, puff 1 puff 1
And, of course, you never know, Sir,
When you get a little closer,
Why, you may^be disillusioned like that puff, puff, puff 1

Should these same people's verdict be
So nasty as the present one.
Strophe of Professors.
Of course, the Frenchman's right enough
About the undergrads.,
Their manners often are the rough,
Uncultured ways of cads;
They racket round about the quad.,
They whistle, shout and sing,
They even have been seen to nod
When we are lecturing.
Their ignorance is dark as night,
Their prose is barbarous;
So far, indeed, the Frenchman's right—
It's when he speaks of us.'

Lady [soUmnly). "When you bis a boy always loafing round street corners,
WHAT PLACE IN LIFE DO YOU SUPPOSE HE IS FITTING HIMSELF FOR!"
Boy. "TO BE A POLICEMAN, MUM I"
Absurd! As if the fellow knew—
He writes himself a sham
When criticising us—lie sn-
tor supra crepidam!
Antistrophe of Students.
What! Not distinguished, Froggy?
Those
Whose everlasting doom
Is hearing one another prose
Each night in Common Room?
Distinguished! Not these dull old dons
Who give us lectures dry
On Euclid, Asinorum pons,
And functions x and y?
Who drone by morning, noon, and night
Of Homer, jEschylus ?—
By Jove ! old Froggy, you are right—
It's when you talk of us!
Why, then you show us how a brain
Not altogether bad
May be on some points fairly sane,
On others, raving mad.
Chorus of Professors and Students.
But, after all, what matter how
A Frenchman, cross and moody, sees?
Another question rises now,
Quu judicabit judices?
The Frenchman's clearly blind, and
more—
We will not care a bit for him;
His vulgar lies we will ignore—
The only treatment fit for hiin.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
[August 7, 1901.
P. P. S.
["You have permitted Cape Colonyto be ravaged
and my property destroyed by a set of murderers,
thieves and incendiaries, when you might easily
have prevented it by hanging a few of these
criminal lunatics who rebelled when all chance of
success was hopeless." — Extract from the lent
letter signed " P. S." in the Morning Post."]
Some weeks ago I gave my mind
(In Punch) to trying hard to guess
Who writes the letters that are signed
"P. S."
I searched directories day and night,
And every Blue-book I possess,
For men whom these initials might
Express.
But though I followed every trail,
I had to own that no success
Had crowned my efforts to unveil
"P. S."
So when the other day I hit
Upon a letter to the Press
Fall of the old familiar bit-
terness,
And recognised the trenchant style,
The fierce invective, I confess
I murmured, with a happy smile,
"P. S.!"
"Will this," I cried, "reveal to me
The secret of our friend's address?"
I read it through, and joyfully
Said, "Yes!"
The Cape invaders have destroyed
His house, and made a beastly mess,
And this has very much annoyed
"P. S."
Tn this a shadowy hint he gives
Of where to find him, more or less,
The colony where lived (or lives ?)
"P. S."
But hints like this don't take one far,
And so I cry in my distress,
"Do tell me who you really are,
'P. S.! *"
GLADSHAW'S HOLIDAY.
(A Suggestion to Husbands.)
"I've made all arrangements for you
and the children to start to-morrow,"
said Gladshaw. "The 'bus will be here,
early; and you will reach Blowgate-on-
Sea in time for a good midday meal."
"How thoughtful of you, dear.—Tommy,
if you do that again you shall go to bed.
... I don't care whether it's your fault or
Ada's. . . . You shall both go to bed.—
And, Geoffrey, you '11 eome down at the
week end?"
"No, dear, certainly not, quite impos-
sible," said Gladshaw, firmly. "This
holiday is for you and the children"
"But what of you?"
Gladshaw rose quietly and put a bun-
dle of journals into his wife's hands.
"These are comic papers, Jane. Look
through them carefully, and then ask
yourself whether you wish to see your
husband filling the part of one of these
wretched idiots. Ah! I see you smiling.
Well, so far I have your respect. But if
I come down to Blowgato with you and
the children, then you will turn from me
as the imbecile seaside-lodging beach-
crazed husband of the confounded comic
cut. No, I'11 stay at home."
* * # *
Gladshaw kept his word, and stayed in
London all through August. He might
have gone out on his own account with a
bachelor friend to Ostend or Boulogne,
or even Paris, for a day or so. -Indeed,
more than once he was on the point of
doing so, and then remembered in time
that this would only pander to the comic
paper. He recollected with disgust
various "cuts" rejoicing in some such
title as "Hubby enjoys himself." And
so GLADSHAW remained at home.
But there was one thing which he
dreaded. He did not care to be out of it
when "holiday experiences" cropped up
at the club. And so every evening for a
week he locked himself in his study and
worried Baedeker.
* * * *
"What sort of holiday?" asked Brown.
"I suppose you were with the wife and
kids, eh?"
"Oh, no!" said Gladshaw, airily.
"Fact is, I had a fancy for the Norwegian
fjords. There's scenery for you, Brown.
Why, from," etc., etc.
"What a memory for places you have,"
interjected Brown, admiringly. "Gad!
wish I'd had such a holiday!" A. R.
POLITICIANS AT PLAY.
By on Enlightened Member.
[" Gentlemen in the House of Commons Beem to
fancy that the public take them seriously. It is
more true than they think that the House of
Commons is losing the respect of the country."—
The Times, July 23.]
THERE'S nothing so nice that I know of
Asa day in the House free from worrying,
Amid a perpetual flow of
Grave gentlemen in and out hurrying
Where pale politicians are prattling,
'Tis very amusing to hear 'em,
In voluble verbiage battling,
And don'tthey flush up when you jeer'em.
(Chorus—briskly after the first word.)
But what does it matter—
The chatting and chattel:—
So long as the thing doesn't weary us?
It adds to our pleasure
To throw out a measure
For no one imagines we 're serious.
'Tis mildly amusing, I will say—
Though carried too far it is irksome—
To toy with a Factory Bill, say,
Though many a gentleman shirks 'em;
To languidly listen to speeches,
And vent an occasional " hear! hear!"
When somebody calmly beseeches
Support on a motion for Pure
(C)iorus.)
But what does it matter?
We chaff and we chatter
On Factory Bills and the Beer-y fuss;
We cut 'em all short
By a clever retort,
For no one imagines we 're serious.
We juggle with figures statistic,
But always with good-humoured jollity;
It makes life far less realistic
Does an innocent touch of frivolity,
While it adds to the charm of debating;
And we deluge with questionings
numerous
The Member who starts legislating,
For this in itself is so humorous.
(Chorus.)
And what does it matter?
'Tis innocent chatter
And, taken all round, doesn't weary us.
For life in the lobby
Is merely a hobby,
And no one imagines it's serious.
W. H. M.
TO MEMORY DEAR.
Dear Mr. Punch,—Now that people are
thinking of leaving London for the Coast,
it may be as well to get out a hotel tariff
not to be exceeded by any manager en-
trusted with the care of a caravanserai
in any district, however fashionable it
may be. If the following items are made
maximum charges everywhere, a great
deal of unnecessary and unpleasant cor-
respondence to the papers concerning ex-
tortion will be avoided. £ s. d.
Bedroom overlooking a dead wall 0 15 0
Attendance per person - - 0 5 0
Electric lights and candles per
day 040
Cup of tea 010
Cup of tea with three slices of
bread and butter - - - 0 2 6
Use of the reading and smoking
rooms - - - - - 026
Table d'hote breakfast (tea and
eggs)- - - - -050
Table d'hote lunch (sardines, soup

Table d'hote dinner (soup and
three courses) - - - - 0 15 0
Soda and brandy - - - - 0 2 0
Speaking to the hall porter- - 0 5 0
Other tips - (not less than) - 1 0 0
There, nothing could be fairer. I have
left any calculation concerning laundry
prices out of my estimate, because such
charges vary with the locality. Still, I
think it safe to say that except in ultra
expensive hotels you will never be asked
to pay more than half-a-crown for the
washing of a pair of socks.
Yours faithfully,
A Contented Tourist.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A Great Thought for Every Day in the Year.
Second Series.
VII.—THE HOLIDAY PROGRAMME SECTION.
(Continued from July.)
(With the Author's compliments to Mr. Henry Harland, begging
him, as soon as may be, to publish another novel as charm-
ing as "The Cardinal's Snuff-box.")
JULY 18th TO 21st.—For the garden of a chalet, picked up on
the -word of a bailiff's advertisement, with never an asterisk in
Baedeker to guarantee the Aussicht, it was not so bad a spot to
drink beer in under a July sun, very aperitive to the pores.
At Peter's feet swept the Rhine in a swirling rush of molten
lead, gathering speed, compressing its flanks, for the rapids
below Lauffenburg. Across the river, beyond the feathery
slopes of the castle-grounds, the forest uplands of Baden
stretched, ridge above ridge of pine, oak, larch, northwards to
the bastioned heights of Menzenschwand, vague, symbolic,
impalpable on the horizon's verge.
A schoolboy memory of the Muse beat importunate on his
brain. "Positively," he thought, "what with the river, the
lawns, the pines, and a fair substitute for topmost Gargarus,
the scene might be sitting for a photogravure illustration of
(Enone. Not, of course, a perfect analogy. Thus, the Rhine at
this stage is somewhat bulky for the exercise of 1 falling
through the clov'n ravine in cataract after cataract '"
But he had only got as far as the second cataract, when—
"You find the view a touch too chromographic?" The voice
was female, but of a fine distinction, but of a full, rich, con-
tralto resonance, to rival the roar of the intervening flood.
Involuntarily Peter rose and bowed to the opposite bank.
A lovely phantom met his glance, clear-cut, crisp-edged,
dazzling white against the peacock-green of her environment.
For a brief minute, crowded with dim recognition, incredulity,
triumphant assurance, Peter was beside himself, and neither
of him could find an answer to the lady's preamble. Oh, but
with good excuse, for was not this her first word with Peter?
Thus far, he had only seen her in public at varying distances,
had had no speech of her, had just surmised her enough to
make her the heroine of his novel.
"You find it somewhat arranged, crude, obvious?" she
asked in English; oh, yes, in quite good English.
"On the contrary, I had pronounced it a Tennysonian har-
mony." Peter spoke with an outward aplomb; but his heart
was beating just anywhere between his boots and his Homburg
hat.
"Ah, yes," she said, "you allude to (Enone. An admirable
classic." Her manner, as if inured to dialectic, might have
confessed her a Girtonian, but for a something, an I-know-
not-what of banter in her left eyelid, scarce perceptible across
the estranging river.
"I admit the analogy to be imperfect," replied Peter.
"By the way," she said, "I hope that the chalet answers
fairly to the terms of my advertisement; that you don't think
the photographs were cooked." Again, the slight depression
of the azure-veined left lid. Then, with a valedictory bow and
in the easiest possible manner—" Please let me know if the
drains go wrong. Good evening."
"An adorable creature," he reflected, as the crisp-edged
vision of whiteness vanished up the lawns. "What a nerve,
what intuition, what femininity I"
******
22nd, 23rd.—" Will the High-born have yet another beer?"
It was the Swiss maid, waisted like a young cedar, stolidly
flamboyant in her local finery.
"Gretchen," answered Peter, abstractedly in English,
"to cite the words of our late immortal laureate, on whom we
have already touched allusively, 'the truth, that flies the
flowing can, will haunt the vacant cup.' At present I shrink
from truth; I would soar on the pinions of Phaethonian pre-
sumption. You do not chance to keep any hashish on the
promises ?''
"Bitte, mein Herr?"
"Ja wohl, noch ein Glas Bier. And, Gretchen," he con-
tinued in the vernacular, " tell me who lives opposite."
"The noblest Sir does not know? It is Her Serene Widow-
hood, the Herzogin vox Basel-Basel."
"Her Widowhood !" murmured Peter, greatly relieved.
"Her Serene Widowhood," Gretchen corrected.
"Implying a superiority to the need of consolation?" asked
Peter.
"Bitte?"
"Yes, yes, more beer, Gretchen; do not hesitate to bring me
more beer."
******
24th, 25th.—Ten days later Peter sat in the garden trying
vainly to make copy out of his despair. Behind him swept the
Rhino in a swirling rush of molten lead, gathering speed,
compressing its flanks, for the narrows below the village. An
agitated dachshund was tracking water-vermin with plaintive
whines.
"Is the dog attached to you?" The voice was female, but of
a fine distinction, of a rich, ripe, contralto resonance, transilient
across the roar of the river.
Peter started to his feet. His heart was still volatile; but
this time he was more prepared, composed, alert. "In the
absence of other diversions, he consents to be aware of my
propinquity," he replied. "But for tho moment he is preying
upon his fellow-brute."
"An illustration of the universal law of Nature?" she asked,
with an air of serious detachment. But there was a something,
an I-really-hardly-know-what of badinage in her smile.
"So careful of the type, so careless of the single life," replied
Peter. Loverlike, he was eager to improve the occasion, to
expand himself in the profundities of dogma.
"Have you observed," he continued, "that in this incessant
war of pursuer and pursued, the nobler the nature of the
animal the greater the modification he undergoes by his
ignoble employ. The rat himself pursues a yet inferior class of
vermin, and in the process becomes but negligibly deformed.
Tho dachshund, on tho other hand, degenerates into a mere
abortion, a caricature of a dog. Is not here a premonitory
warning for the highest form of Nature—I refer to Humanity?"
"Oh," she said, "you are much, much too clover for me.
But I am nothing if not a child of Nature; so I shall harden my
heart and go on ' still achieving, still pursuing.' Some people
like being pursued, is it not so?" And on the word she had
withdrawn before Peter's density could compose a pertinent
retort.
"What a nerve," he mused, "what intuition, what
Weiblichkeit!"
******
28th TO 31st.—The first touch of autumn was on the valley,
as Peter crossed the castle-lawns to take his last leave of the
Herzogin. Her creed he might have contrived to adopt, but
there was no getting over this eternal offence of her title and
her wealth. The lady was above him and away. It was the
old tale of Queen Kate of Cornaro and the page-boy, that
"pined for the grace of her so far above his power of doing
good to."
As for the view, its general features were practically
unchanged. Beyond the feathery slopes of the castle-grounds
the great forest uplands of Baden stretched, ridge above ridge
of pine, larch, oak, northwards to the bastioned heights, &c. A
schoolboy memory of the Muse beat importunate upon his
brain. "Positively," he thought, "what with the river, the

lawns, the pines, and the best of substi-
tutes for topmost Gargarus" (repeat, as
above, down to the words, " cataract after
cataract ")
But he had only got as far as the second
"cataract," -when
"You find the view a touch too chromo-
graphic?"
Peter started and bowed to a gracious
phantom of whiteness, crisp-cut, clean-
edged, on a rustic seat. His heart was
beating just anywhere between his boots
and his Homburg hat. Oh, but with good
excuse, for Peter was in love, but very
very much in love.
"You find it somewhat arranged, crude,
obvious?" she asked.
"On the contrary I had pronounced it
a Tennysonian harmony."
"Ah, yes," she said, "you allude to
(Enone. An admirable classic." Her
manner, as if inured to dialectic, might
have confessed her a Girtonian. But
there was a something, &o.
"I admit the analogy to be imperfect,"
replied Peter.
"Your dog is still attached to you?"
She pointed with quick spontaneity to the
agitated dachshund pursuing imaginary
game in the shrubbery.
"In the absence of other diversions,
yes. But for tho moment ho preys upon
his follow-bruto."
"An illustration of tho universal law
of Nature? No, please," she added, as
Peter was in act to take up his cue; "I
cannot bear any more of it. Let us try a
new conversation. What are you carrying
there?"
"I am restoring to the Bishop his latch-
key. He dropped it," said Peter, sheep-
ishly.
"Not again!" she said; "how un-
original of him! By-the-by, is your new
novel finished?"
"My new novel!" ho cried, aghast.
"Who told you that I write novels?"
"But you must have known that I
knew. No author ever hid his profession
under a bushel for a week together. And,
being an author on a holiday, you would
never think of missing such a chance of
copy. What are you going to call this
account of your latest experiences?"
"I am calling it The Bishop's Latch-
key," said Peter, sheepishly. "It sounds
so alluring. That's why I keep carrying
the thing about. 1 have to drag it into the
picture somehow."
"I think, out of courtesy, you might
give up that title, and call the book after
me. 1 must be more import-ant than the
latch-key. But 1 'm afraid the Indiscre-
tion of the Duchess has been used al-
ready." There was a something in her
manner—could it have been the very least
little depression of the azure-veined left
lid ?—that suddenly emboldened Peter.
For the time being she lent him her eyes,
to see things by as she saw them.
"Certainly," he replied ; " I will drop
my title and take your name instead,
on the understanding that you, for your
part"
"That I, for my part, drop my title
and take your namo instead?" she asked,
with a very pleasant frankness.
"Precisely," he said.
"Oh, very well," said she. O. S.
THEN AND NOW.
Time was to Scotland I would go,
When hot July to August drew;
I loved to stalk the timid roe
Upon the heights of Ben Venue.
To crawl from rock to rock, to plough
Through bog and swamp was once my
wont,
I loved it then intensely. Now
I don't.
Time was I loved my fly to cast
Upon the waters of the Tay,
And, heedless of the rainy blast,
To wade waist deep the livelong day.
That now would make me chill and numb—
'Tis not that I am growing old,
'Tis that the water has become
So cold.
When o'er the land the breeze blew hot,
I loved to skim the dancing seas,
And in my little white-winged yacht
To coast the stormy Hebrides.
To watch tho penny steamboats now
Upon the Thames is quite enough;
The sea has lately grown, somehow,
So rough.
Time was I tramped, with rod and gun,
Mile after mile for fish and fowl,
Rising before the sluggard sun,
And bedding with the midnight owl.
This year, methinks, another way
Of change and rest I '11 try instead;
I '11 take a holiday and stay
In bed.

COMFOI1TABLB. An' THEY HAIN'T NO BAD JUDGI NEITHER I"
THE COMPLETE AUTHOR.
If you want to bo an author and to take the world by storm,
Pay attention whilst I mention rules to which you must conform;
First, of course, you want a heroine—it doesn't matter who—
Plain or pretty, dull or witty, ignoramus or a blue,
Young or middle-aged or ancient, it is really all the same,
Provided you've decided that Elizabeth's her name.
You must have a little garden, you must babble by the hour,
Of the lilies, daffodillies, hollyhock and gilly-fiower;
Or when vegetables bore you, and you 're anxious to relieve
The monotony of botany, you may perhaps achieve
A digression on the slugs and snails that eat your pet rose-trees,
Or the habits of the rabbits, or the squirrels or the bees.
Next, whatever the temptation to behold your name in print,
It is vital that the title-page should have no author in't;
What were Junius himself if his identity were known?
Who would trouble with a bubble that is burst before it's
blown?
How can books without a mystery expect to make a fuss?
People grovel to a novel if it is anonymous.
As for form, you must consider what the reading-world expects,
And epistles are the thistles that the public ass affects;
So abolish old-world chapters, and at each new section's head
You had better write your "Letter Number So-and-So " instead;
And you '11 quite eclipse the fame of many literary men,
For you're fated to be rated as a man of letters then.
Nor forget to tell creation what a genius you are;
Set each daily singing gaily of the newly-risen star,
Every pago of every paper where a mortal eye may look
Thus adorning with, "Good-morning! Have you read Delh's
Garden Book?"
And assure them it's essential they should have it on their
shelves—
They might never be so clever as to learn the fact themselves.
OPERA AND AFTER.
The Opera Season for 1001 is over. Notable for Jean de
Rkszke's conspicuous absence. On the whole, the Opera Line
has been run on the "high level." Wagnerites have not by
any means had it all to themselves. Madame Eames is to be
congratulated on improvement as an actress and on there
being no improvement wanted in her singing. Melba is as
charming as ever: perhaps the riverside in this hot weather
has had a refreshing effect, and so she must consider Father
Thames as her contributary. Calve always admirable, and far
too powerful in Messaline, has been excellent throughout,
except when appearing as the willing victim of the unhappy
Faust, and then—-well, personally, I could have wished that no
Mephistophelian manager had ever tempted her to play and
sing the part. Grand Otcllo-Tamagno lirst-rato, so Herr Van
Rooy: Jupiter Planron incomparable in everything, be he
ascetic monk, unprincipled roue, or devotedly pious king. All
is artistic that comes to his net. The throe conductors, Signor
Mancinelli, Herr Lohse, and Monsieur Flon, one down, t'other
come up, have, baton in hand, led their men to victory. Opera
finished, Messrs. Frank Rendle and Manager Neil Forsyth
take possession of the Opera House, and commence preparations
for the annual Goose step, with plenty of caper sauce, charac-
teristic of the Fancy Dress Ball Season. Sic transit: si dance-it.

Oenial Doctor (after laughing heartily at a joke of his patient's). "Ha! HA 1 HA I There's

Irrepressible Patient. "Why, of course I should. It would be my last chance I"
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from the Diaey of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, July 29.—
Markiss moves second reading of Royal
Titles Bill. Rosebery suggests that in-
stead of the cumbrous clause, "Of the
British Dominions beyond the Seas, King,"
Edward the Seventh should be hailed,
King of the Britains beyond the Seas.
The Markiss thought not. Phrase he
held to be strange, even uncouth.
Why uncouth the Markiss only knows.
If hypercriticism wanted to quarrel with
it it might be urged that it is an echo of
one of the musical lines in Tennyson's
welcome to our present Queen when she
first came over the sea.
There was, the Markiss further urged,
no precedent for the phrase. "If the
noble Marquis," said Rosebery, "will
consult the small change in his pocket
he will find on its face the words 1 Bri-
tanniarum Regina.'"
Pretty to see the shrewd look that came
over the Markiss's expressive counte-
nance; the slightly screwed lip, the
curled nostril, almost a wink. Had read
somewhere about the Confidence Trick;
only vaguest idea of what it is; certain
that someone you meet in the street asks
you to produce a coin, or a larger sum of
money. You comply, and by some hocus
pocus the coin is transferred to the other
man's pocket, and you go your way
lamenting.
Rosebery has just that innocent, boyish
face that would be invaluable in such an
enterprise. Of late, owing doubtless to
the succession of dinners eaten at distinct
points of the compass by the Party he
once led, he is developing the embon-
point that marks the genial man accus-
tomed to do good deeds. Anyone he
chanced to meet in the street to whom he
made proposition to produce a fiver and
lay it in his outstretched hand, promising
a tenner for the mark of personal con-
fidence, would instantly produce the
money—that is, of course, if he had it
about him.
The Markiss too old a bird to be caught
by appearances. He stared straight ahead
of him, and, heedless of ROSEBERY'S
insinuating invitation, kept his coin safe
in his pocket.
Business done.—Royal Titles Bill read
a second time.
House of Commons, Tuesday 2 A.M.—
"Begorra, the young 'un's done us!"
'Twas the voice of Mr. Flavin; he had
good cause to complain. When, early in
Session, a tyrannical Minister, backed by
an unscrupulous majority, passed Standing
Order authorising expulsion for remainder
of Session of Members guilty of disorderly
conduct, it was felt a new and deadly
injustice had been wrought to Ireland.
Heretofore an Irish Member might have
his fling and obtain bold advertisement in
the Nationalist papers at the cost of a
week's suspension. As in such circum-
stances William O'Brien's sordid injunc-
tion stopping wages during absence from
Parliamentary duties did not apply, it
meant in addition to glory a week's
holiday on full pay. A very different
thing to be expelled for rest of Session
from House, with all its comfortable
surroundings, its daily opportunity of
getting your name in the newspapers.
The game not worth so costly a candle.
Accordingly Irish Members, practising
truculence as far as was safe, always
stopped short when limit of Speaker's
supernal patience was reached. Their
turn would come by-and-by when, end
of Session practically determined, they
could calculate to a nicety how much
their advertisement would cost; a fort-
night, ten days, or a week, according as
they selected their day for bearding the
Speaker in his chair. Will all take their
turn in time. Obviously the chiefest
distinction, the biggest advertisement,
goes to the Member who leads off. By
repetition performance palls on public
taste. With four-score men, in small or
large batches, going through the same
noisy antics, followed by same disciplinary
procedure, thing becomes a bore. The
honours are with the man who opens the
ball. j
, Time running short now. Little more
than a fortnight of Session remaining.
Strange restlessness pervades Irish camp.
Members look at each other suspiciously.
Swift MacNbil up at Question time, ,
waving his arms in windmill fashion,
regarded with especial concern. Does he |
mean business this time? Is he going to 1
sneak a mean advantage? Relief when
Ihe sits down breathless. Anxiety re-'
newed when Mr. Flavin lifts his tall head

wearing in his countenance the green of
envy, made a dash at his coat-tails;
succeeded in getting himself carried off
with him.
This happened whilst Mr. Flavin was
walking on the Terrace communing
with the stars. At sound of Division
Bell, strolled upstairs to find himself
locked out; to learn that, as he put it,
"the young 'un had done them."
Business done.—Redmond cadet and

camp growing strained. If things go on
as they now shape the Nationalists will

Ominous talk of a dinner to be given to
Redmond cadet at the " Shamrock'' Restau-
rant ; threats that if invitation be accepted,
Mr. Flavin shall be banqueted at the
"Harp-that-Once." The principal guests
have promptly intimated their readiness
to attend; which seems to have thrown a
cloud over the proceedings. Anyhow,
not yet gone further.
Meanwhile, Mr. O'Shee, of all men, has
managed to take the wind out of the sails
of other mariners bound for the haven and
the honour of expulsion. Redmond aini,
who bears up pretty well under his be-
reavement, asked Prince Arthur to oblige
Irish Members by setting aside public
business in order to give them a day on
which they might make personal attack
on Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in his
judicial capacity. Prince Arthur thought,
on the whole, he would rather not. Red-
mond nine righteously indignant. What's
the use of the House of Commons if, safe
in its sanctuary from the law of libel,
hon. members may not slander private
foes and vilify public servants?
Above the hubbub that followed was
heard the shrill voice of Mr. O'Shee
denouncing "judicial blackguardism."
Time was when for peace sake, in
generous hope that manners might im-
prove, the Chair would have been dis-
creetly deaf to this remark. The Speaker
at length convinced it's no use playing
with organised disorder which through
the Session has bubbled in the Irish
camp. Down on O'Shee like a shot;
insisted on withdrawal of offensive re-
mark. O'Shee, fluttered by this un-
wonted firmness, hesitated; turned for
counsel to friends near him. They, car-
ried away by excitement of moment, for-
getful of his personal advantage, urged
him on. So O'Shee defied the Speaker,
was promptly suspended, and went forth
to join the growing army of martyrs
already on holiday leave.
Business done.—Education Bill read a
third time.
MDSIC HATH
There's a lady I know
(To my grief and my woe,
For she lives in the very next flat down
below,
And flats are not proof against sound, as
you know)
Whose joy is to play
The piano all day,
And to lift up her pitiful voice in a way
That frightens my poor little Muse into
fits,
And drives her demented, clean out of her
wits,
And me into words I'm unable to smother,
Though they'd certainly shock me if used
by another.
C! C!
So hammers she
While she loudly gives voice to a very
flat B
To which I reply with a very sharp D.
A! A!
Next she will play,
While her voice is at B or still further
away;
And the greater the discords that come
from her throat
The louder she bangs the unfortunate
note,
Till my poor little Muse claps her hands
to her ears
And flies from my flat in a torrent of tears.
When her throat has got sore
And can quaver no more,
She sends for the tuner, and almost before
The neat little mannikin gets to the door
I hear her complain
In a much aggrieved strain:
"That wretched piano wants tuning
again!"
So the meek little tuner the key-board
doth try—
He pitches it low and he pitches it high
In the vainest of efforts: it never will go
In tune with the voice of the lady below.
HOLIDAY TASKS.
Change of employment, it has been
said, is the truest form of recreation. In
pursuance of this idea, Mr. Punch has
devised a plan which has enabled his
brilliant staff to enjoy a true holiday,
while, at the same time, their valuable
services are not lost to his columns. For
instance, he despatched his cricket re-
porter to a concert, with the result that
the notice of it runs as follows:
"Hcrr Thumpoki'SKY's recital un-
doubtedly is one of tho most attractive
fixtures of tho season, and it was not
surprising to find a large gate on Thursday
night. The first two performers on the
programme were easily disposed of for
a single ballad apiece, but Herr Thump-
OFFSKY himself was in fine form. Ho
opened quietly, but after playing himself
in, seemed completely at home for the
rest of his innings. Some of his late
cuts in the treble were particularly fine,
and ho scored a number of quick runs by
dexterous wrist-play in a manner which
elicited hearty applause. Towards the
end of the second movement he slowed
down somewhat, and two or three of his
uppish strokes in tho Scherzo appeared
a trifle risky, but these wore small
blemishes in a highly meritorious per-
formance. He was heartily cheered when
lie returned to the pavilion, but, despite
the applause of the onlookers, declared
his innings closed."
From our high-souled literary critic's City
report.
"Brighton A's! Something of magic,
surely, lingers o'er the phrase. Brighton
—the place of sunny, windy memories, of
the roystering Regent, of old-world
scandals, loves, intrigues. And yet they
fell, these Brighton A's, 1-16—or rose,
perchance, 1-12? It boots not to remem-
ber; of Brighton the charm is perennial;
outlasting rise or fall, mode or moment.
And what, you ask, of Eldorados? They
were in brisk demand—aye, and in brisk
demand will bo so long as aspirations
vague, ineluctable, find their abode within
the heart of man. I fancy, Sir, I'm
dropping into verse. The name of
Eldorado is the cause. Dear Eldorado!
dear long-wished-for land of happiness
and infinite delight! Yes, Eldorados
were in brisk demand."
From our dramatic critic's remarks on a
race-meeting.
"The performance was not altogether
bad, but the stage-management was very
far from artistic. When, for instance, the
favourite won, it was allowed to lead
from start to finish. Need 1 point out
how much the effect would have been
enhanced had it been made to snatch the
victory by a neck? Again, the hoisting of
the numbers at the winning-post should
have been the cue for at least one of the
spectators to shoot himself. Strange to
say, this well-established piece of busi-
ness was forgotten. Until these and other
defects arc madegood, such a trite perform-
ance is not likely to attract the public."
Puddleton Market report, sent in by our
Lady contributor.
"There was an unusually smart gather-
ing in tho square to-day. Among others
we noticed Mrs. Giles, escorted by her
husband. She was gowned in an exquisite
creation of blue and yellow spotted
muslin—one of the latest novelties, we
believe, from the Puddleton post-office.

[August 7, 1901.
SORROWS OF PATERFAMILIAS AT THE SEASIDE.
Long since, I came to the conclusion that Marion—Marion
is my wife—was right in everything. At all events, I say so.
It saves so much argument. So when one morning at break-
fast she said that the dear children wanted a change, I at once
agreed with her, and went on reading my paper.
Marion poured herself out a second cup of coffee, and then
said reflectively:
"I suppose Scarborough wouldn't do?"
Again I agreed with her, readily. Scarborough would not do,
and once more settled down to a perusal of the money article.
After a brief pause, she went on:
"What do you think of the Isle of Wight?"
I replied that I thought very highly of the Isle of Wight. As
the summer home of our King
"Don't be silly, George," she interrupted. "Do put down
that paper, and try to settle where we can go to this summer."
Now, the truth is that SiMSGlDDY and I had talked over
the question of taking our holiday together, en garden.
Talked over it, with bated breath, be it understood: for Sims-
qiddy is as much married as I. am myself; his olive branches
amount to seven, whilst my blessings are eight in number.
Still, we thought that we should obtain more change and rest
by going away minus our families. And whilst he had pro-
posed this daring innovation, I had promised to seriously
consider it and see if the annual visit en famille to the seaside
could be dodged.
So I lowered the newspaper, and, peeping over the top of it,
said:
"Er—an idea occurs to me, Marion. Suppose you take the
darlings away, whilst I—I—er—I just run out of town for
a few days—I daresay I could get that fellow SiMSGlDDY to
go with me, if I asked him." Then I paused to see the effect.
Marion almost choked herself with a piece of toast.
"What! and leave me with all the children? What next,
I should like to know?"
"Still, my dear, it might be more of a change if"
But here Marion brought up her strongest battery of quick-
firing arguments in order to silenco my feeble guns.
"George, I am surprised at you. I couldn't have thought
that you and that horrid SiMSGlDDY man could possibly have
concocted such a plot to go away and leave me alone with
all the children; and how I'm to manage with nurse going on
as she does, and no pleasing her, I don't know—it's really too
wearing for any woman, let alone me. I don't believe you care
for me any longer, and that's about the truth!"
And matters went no farther that day. I thought dear
Marion would sulk, so prudently remained late at the office
and stayed out to dinner. It is strange how one's atten-
tion to business suddenly increases under such circumstances.
But Marion triumphed in the end. I really had not the
courage to repeat my suggestion—and Simsciddy'S scheme went
to the wall. It was finally settled that we should go to
Cockleton-super-Maro for our summer trip. "Which day will
you go down and see about apartments? " asked Marion.
"I? Oh, I thought that perhaps you, my dear—1 mean that
you would be a better judge of "but Marion's brow grew
wrinkled, and I paused, irresolute.
"Nonsense, George. You will go. I have looked at Brad-
thaw, and And that you can manage to get there and back in
the day, by catching the 6.10 train in the morning."
I shivered. "I—I think, my dear, I had better, perhaps, go
a little later, and stay the night at the hotel."
"Oh, there's not the slightest need for that expense,"
and I thought that Marion's tone was somewhat tart.
"Then, perhaps, my dear, I had better have breakfast
overnight," I murmured.
But Marion was quite impervious to covert levity. I had to
go by the C.10 a.m. train.
Arrived at Cockleton, I fortified myself with a station sand-
wich and a glass of soda-water (with just a little whiskey in it)
before sallying forth along the "front."
I tried three or four houses, and then one with a balcony
attracted my notice. It was called Shore Villa. I knocked,
and was admitted by the landlady.
Marion had specially warned me against flighty-looking
landladies. So I was naturally glad to find that this person's
appearance would at once acquit her of any such charge. No
photographer would have run the risk of pitting his camera
against such a face as hers, unless he had insured the instru-
ment first.
"Guinea a room all August." No, she couldn't take less—oh,
and there was a big fambly, too? Ah, that made a difference—
another 'arf guinea and hextrys, if there was a baby. Oh, yes,
I could see the rooms—yes, they was beautiful rooms. Clean?
She should think so, indeed! Cook? Well, if she couldn't
cook by this time—well, there!
Of course, this last remark clinched the matter; I took the
rooms, and Arranged to bring my family down on the following
Thursday.
We were not fortunate in our train on the day fixed. There
appeared to be about twice as many passengers as there were
seats. Under these circumstances, even Marion's equable
temper showed signs of friction. She grew hot and flushed,
spoke sharply to our offspring, bullied the nurse and finally
called me an idiot.
At last Willy, Molly, Charles, Nurse and baby, and I
squeezed into one carriage, whilst Marion and the rest
scrambled into another. Bed-faced porters hurled our small
paraphernalia in after us, and the much-harassed guard banged
the door, shutting my coat tail in, securely. We were off.
At Boodlesby Junction, after hailing the guard to release my
coat tail, I got out and went to Marion.
"George," she said, "go into the Refreshment Room and
get the children some milk."
"My dear," I remonstrated, " I—I—I really don't think it's
likely that they keep such a thing on a station. Now, ginger-
beer, or even"
"Don't be so absurd, George, of course they have milk. Do
make haste, or I'm sure the train will be starting again. Here,
give me the tickets in case you get left behind!"
I sighed, but had to go and ask the yellow-haired damsel at
the refreshment buffet for three glasses of milk. The lady
giggled, adjusted a sidecomb in her yellow hair, and then
leisurely condescended to hand me the three tumblers of milk,
already poured out. There was a fly in two out of the three.
I looked at them dubiously. Then I asked her if I might have
another fly for the third tumbler? She seemed quite annoyed
at this. I bought some buns, and' carefully holding the three
milk glasses I made my uncertain and fearful way down the
over-crowded platform.
Of course I passed the carriage I was looking for, and went
the whole length of the train before discovering my error;
then I retraced my steps, and Marion, tarter than ever,
exclaimed:
"My dear George, I thought you must have lost your way!"
Then (rather spitefully, as I thought), "What could you have
had to talk about to that creature at the bar?"
I said nothing. I waited patiently until the milk had been
consumed; then ran back with the empty tumblers—no time
left in which to get anything for myself—and finally scrambled
into my carriage again, hot, breathless, and so thirsty.
After what seemed an interminable journey, we arrived.
MARION thought we could get the luggage and ourselves into
two cabs, and became just a little snappish when I expressed
a doubt. However, after several packings and re-packings, in
the course of which baby's particular trunk fell off the box-seat,
smashed, we started for Shoro Villa. I felt anxious to see
whether Marion would approve of the rooms—for when dear

Marion disapproves, I find it more politic
to curtail my holiday.
I assumed an air of mild hilarity, ■when,
after settling two altercations with the
cabmen about their fares, I approached
my wife, and rubbing my hands together,
said:
"This is all very jolly, isn't it, my
dear?"
Marion gazed abstractedly at the
carpet before replying. Then, looking
up at me, she said solemnly:
"George—I smell a rat!"
"Do you, indeed, my dear? That's
very unpleasant," I replied, sniffing
about as I spoke. "I don't smell any-
thing, myself."
"No, no! "What I mean is that I sus-
pect the woman—the landlady—is not
clean."
"You don't say so, my dear! Then
perhaps it was that, and not the rat"
"Oh, George, don't be so dense! " she
cried in worried tones. "I mean that the
house is not kept clean: can't you under-
stand? Men are so stupid!"
"Yes, my dear, certainly — I quite
agree. I think I '11 take a little walk-
down to the sea, and ■"
"Very well," sighed Marion; "and

Charlie can go with you. Meantime,
Nurse and I will unpack, though where
in the world wo 're to put all the things

peg to be seen, and "'. but by this
time I had gently edged out of the door,
and eluding the dear children, put on
a Panama hat, and strolled out on to the
beach.
1 was just enjoying the first sniff of the
ozone, when a familiar, if not altogether
welcome, voice smote upon my ear. 1
looked round and, to my great surprise,
saw my neighbour at Uampstead, little
Perksley.
Marion says the Perksleys are dread-
fully common. I sincerely trust that they j
are uncommon, their vulgarity is so great.
I should not like to say that Perksley is
an awful little cad—but a man may think
what he likes.
"'Ullo!" he cried, thrusting a warm
red paw into my hand. "Oo'd ever 'ave
thought of seein' you 'ere? Come down
ong garsong, or jest as the ordinary Pater-
Family-Ass?"
One serious drawback of Perksley's is
that he thinks himself a wit.
I infused a certain frigidity into my
manner, as I replied:
"My wife and family are with me."
"Ah, that's right—you must drop in
and bring 'em to see mine. And my
youngsters must play with yours on the
sands."
Very condescending of him. I merely
inclined my head and passed on. How
shall I ever have sufficient courage to
tell dear Marion that I have brought her

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
THE ACTOE-MANAGEE DISCOUESES.
IV.
Madam, I understand you nurse a hope
Of compassing the highest sphere of Art,
That is to say, of going on the stage.
Bear -with me, if experience bids me use
A father's candour, coldly demonstrating
What obstacles, how rude and multiform,
Await your climbing feet. I speak as one
Gifted, I grant, -with genius, yet constrained,
Like great Apollo in Phersean halls,
Through many years to ply the menial task
Until my God-like nature stood confessed.
This goal to which your innocence aspires
Is such as may not lightly be embraced
By methods of the prompt instinctive kind
So well adapted to the lesser arts.
The heights by first-rate histrions reached and kept
Were not attained by sudden-soaring flight,
But by the more exact and arduous route
Of discipline, appointed in the rules
Of hoar tradition. No, my dear young lady,
'Tis not enough that you possess the charms,
Which from your photograph I judge are yours,
Of beauty, grace of figure, virtue, youth,
Though theso are gifts which must not be despised;
They serve their purpose, as I proved myself
Before my latent genius came to light.
Nor does it yet suffice that you have filled—
With marked success, your testimonial says—
A loading role in drawing-room charades.
Indeed, I know no worse apprenticeship
For serious business than to play a part
In amateur theatricals without
Professional guidance. Tricks are thus acquired
Hard to unlearn by years of patient toil;
Such as the childish habit of behaving
As people do in ordinary life;
Of sitting in your chair and keeping still,
To give the axithor's dialogue a chance,
Instead of jumping up to take the floor
At every third remark, and crossing over,
And sitting somewhere else, and coming back;
Motions that might in social intercourse
Seem to betray a lack of that repose
Which stamps the purest caste; but on the stage
Are still among the elemental signs
Of perfect breeding.
Take another point
On which your amateurs are apt to err.
They have a prejudice for looking at
The person whom they happen, in the play,
To bo addressing! They have yet to learn
That any actor, rightly trained, ignores
The presence of an audience on the stage,
Unless compelled by force of circumstance,
Such as the need to kiss, or else to fight,—
Acts that demand collusion. Otherwise
He disregards his fellow; turns on him
His back, his profile, anything except
His speaking eyes, exclusively reserved
To front the empty void which represents
The scenic chamber's complementary wall;
Through which transparent barrier he accosts
The world at large, and only looks elsewhere
When moved to punctuate his dialogue
By desultory prancings up and down.
Trust me, my dear, Dramatic Art is one
Of many noble institutions based
On pure Convention; take her prop away
And she assumes the level of vulgar Life,
Like mountebanks when they mislay their stilts.
You, on the other hand, appear to be
A child of Nature. When I look upon
Your counterfeit presentment, so unspoiled,
So immature, so wistful—I could weep I
I have been faithful to discourage you,
Because, hereafter, I would not be blamed
If, having lost your old love, you attain
Never to clasp the new. Nature and Art
(My Art, I speak of) you must choose between:
No-one, not I myself, can serve them both.
Yet, if—my admonitions duly weighed—
A stubborn overmastering consciousness
Of innate genius, not to be suppressed,
Still urges you (I know the feeling well!)
To make the sacrifice that Art commands,
I shall expect you in my private room
(Stage Entrance) Tuesday next at half-past two,
And we will try and see what can be done.

A FOREIGN LION IN LONDON.
(A Page from a Diary kept during tlie post Season.)
Monday.—The usual list of invitations. Guest of the Under-
takers' Company in the City, members chiefly mill-owners
and stockbrokers. Brought in my peroration about "Liberty
never degenerating into licence" by declaring it to be a grave
subject.
Tuesday.—Cards by the bushel. Guest of the evening at
the Unconventional Burglars' Club. Members chiefly artists,
authors, and millionaires. Peroration, "Liberty never de-
generating into licence" introduced by reference to the
use of the felon of advanced ideas. A little far-fetched, but
passable.
Wednesday.—Again a flood of requests for the honour of
my company. Asked to speak at the Charwomen's Provident
Fund Festival. Referred to the claims of the sensible man.
He did not lose his "liberty when he secured his marriage
licence." Remarks well received.
Thursday.—Wearied to death by Garden Parties and other al
fresco distractions. Dined with another City Company, the
Skate Makers. No one seemed to have anything to do with
the industry. Master turned out to bo a large cab-owner.
Spoke of Holland and its skates. "That was in the land where
Liberty never degenerated into licence." Peroration did not
go so well as usual. Heard afterwards it was suspected of
being pro-Boer.
Friday.—Again they come. Asked to unveil bust of the
great Brown. Never heard of him, but consented. At subse-
quent banquet referred to BnoWN as that true patriot who never
forgot "that liberty was not licence." Peroration right
again.
Saturday.—Happy to say week at an end. Off to my native
land. Reception Committee bid me good-bye. In my reply to
their cheering assured them that theirs was the land where
freedom abounded, and where truo Liberty never was per-
mitted to sink into licence. Same peroration for the series!
Nothing like getting a happy phrase and sticking to it. And
now for a quiet country life to compensate for festival
banquets!
"Nothing new undkr thb sun."—Not even "Arc Lights."
Of course, Noah used them on board ship.

A BALLADE OF LITERARY
ADVERTISEMENT.
[Why should not the literary advertisement be
aa much a recognised branch of art as the artistic
poster? The following verses are an attempt to
serve at once the Muses and Mammon from a
literary point of view.]
Be silent, Broadwood ; and refrain,
Collard, from melody; nor dare,
Steinway, your merits to maintain;
Your airs must vanish in thin air;
For lo 1 when makers you compare,
Of North or South or East or West,
The public's verdict 'will declare
That 's pianos are the best.
O gay guitar of joyous Spain,
O harp, rich, resonant and rare,
O rural pipe with jocund strain,
O flute, of timbre thin and spare,
O trumpet tone of martial blare,
Lyre, violin, and all the rest
Of instruments, your claims forbear,
For 's pianos are the best!
Come, pianists, a mighty train,
From P 1, rich of hair,
Down to the schoolgirl in the lane
Who practises "The Maiden's
Prayer,"
All others you'll henceforth forswear
If once you put these to the test,
And speedily become aware
That 's pianos are the best.

N.B.—iF dealers, all unfair,
A worthless substitute suggest,
Of their nefarious wiles beware 1
For 's pianos are the best.
LA VIE DE LUX.
{From our Special Gormandizer.)
It was the Duchess of Cooafuko (I need
scarcely say that I am diplomatist enough
to disguise the real name of her Grace)
who challenged me to give her a respect-
able dinner in London, and bet me—well,
I will not say what odds the noblewoman
laid, but I may record that my stake
consisted of six dozen pairs of Peau-
dechien's unrivalled twelve - buttoned
guilts de suede, at the not unreasonable
price of half-a-guinea a couple.
Looking through my gastronomical note-
book in the smoking-room of the Albatross
Club (nicknamed the "Ancient Mariner"
by certain wags of Bohemia and the beau
monde), I decided that my choice should
fall on the Pomme de Terre Restaurant,
which is not a thousand miles remote
from Regent Street. Her Grace, I say,
arrived at the Pomme de Terre in that
stylish little brougham, drawn by Andalu-
sian mules, at eight eighteen, and as
she was only half-an-hour and three
minutes late I freely forgave her, with
the better grace because Signor Craca-
bello, the excellent manager of the

A LESSON IN GEOGRAPHY.
"What is water surrounded by land called!"
"Oh, a duck pond, of course."
"No. Water as large as the two fields outside and the garden as well?"
"Oh, that's called Exaggeration I"
Pomme de Terre, was waiting on the steps
of the eating-house with a splendid
bouquet of orchids, rich and creamy as
one of his own souffle's, in his hand.
The Duchess was attired in a piquant
ensemble of rose geranium, in which my
eye did not err in detecting the hand of
Madame Schitzkl, the Anglo-American
artiste. She was, as usual, all smiles,
and when placed in receipt of Signor
Cracabello'8 floral tribute, became a
human sunbeam of good nature.
By the way, I cannot imagine how,
unless I inadvertently gave him the hint,
Cracabello knew that I was awaiting so
distinguished a lady. I was pleased to
find that he had caused the table to be
lighted with electric lamps concealed by
shades matching her Grace's complexion
and costume. I did not forget to pay
him a handsome compliment on his good
taste. The repast to which we sat down
did infinite credit not only to Signor
Cracabello, but also to his chef, Monsieur
Mirliton, who was formerly cordon-bleu
to the Sultan of Mesopotamia.
The menu was arranged as follows—
remember, the day was very hot, and the
thermometer showed no appreciable re-
laxation at the time so pathetically
referred to by Longfellow in his noble
poem, Excelsior:—Bisque d'ecrevisses
(iced), a trifle too red to suit the surround-
ings, but not dear at ten shillings a
portion; whitebait au diable (done,with
curry powder and Nepaul pepper, after
the recipe of my esteemed friend the
Rajah of Picllipore) came next, and cer-
tainly well worth the 9s. 9d. put on the
bill. Then a frozen cucumber stuffed
with caviare—a luxury to be appreciated
at a modest sovereign. A Surrey capon,
larded with pati de Joie gras and farced
with black pudding, was economically
conspicuous at three guineas. A sorbet
of Mexican bananas and Tokay, some
Limburger cheese straws, a dessert of
custard apples and mangoes, followed by
green coffee with a harmony of similarly
coloured chartreuse—such was Joursimplo
repast. Leonard Lux.

EOVING AT RAMSGATE.
Mr. Punch, Sir,—Thus sang the South Anglian Laureate,
B.A., Mus. Doc, S.E.R., L.C.D., &c, as he harped on the same
string over and over again:
Oh, what heavenly weather
What a genuine treat!
As you and I together
Sail in La Marguerite.
As you and I together,
Crossing the ocean, wave
Our hats—we 're in great feather!—
We two so bright and brave!
We wave our hats to the ladies
Of France, who are on the quay,
But what I am much afraid is
Our waving they do not see!
At this point the Bard was restrained: it was just on the
stroke of one, and wo summoned him, as the Ghost of the
Commendatore summoned Don Juan, "down below,"-—only this
was not merely to rcccivo his deserts but to have his lunch.
Feeding good: not great, not luxurious: appetite excellent;
drinkatite ditto. Waiting done by stewards of the Q.C.S.,
which initials stand for "Quiet Civil Service." Doing the
same voyage two days later, 1 find precisely the same bourgeois
menu. If I meet with it on a third journey I may fairly charge
the Chief Steward, or the Purveyors, with lack of imagination,
or with lazily adhering to very old-fashioned notions on the
subject of restauration. Starting from Ramsgate, where it
calls after leaving Margate. By this boat, not too crowded,
but quite sufliciently full to pay and leave something over, we
had, on the first visit, only two complaints to make, and to
whom can they bo made with better effect than to you, Mr,
Punch, P.C.O., i.e. "Public Complaint Officer "?
First, the boat being advertised for 10.45 at Ramsgate, we
being one quarter of an hour before our time on purpose to
escape crowding, found the ticket-office—a kind of bathing
machine in reduced circumstances on very small wheels —
closed, and it was not until the crowd, which we had
tried to escape, had become troublesome, that at length the
pigeon-hole was opened, and there was a struggle for places,
while the ticket^distributor civilly informed us that probably
the Marguerite wouldn't arrive for another hour. Whether
this was his fun, or intended for our comfort, was not evident;
anyway, his remarks had the immediate effect of more or less
irritating everybody, except a few giggling females who haggled
over their small change in so exasperating a fashion as to make
dealing with them quite a penance for the ticket man-in-the-
bathing-machine box-office, who would have saved himself all
this trouble and us all this crowding had he arrived a quarter
of an hour earlier. Then, in a broiling July sun, refreshed
only very occasionally by a whiff of S.E. wind, with no sort
of shelter over us, we, miserable sinners, had to remain,
most of us standing, in a sort of sheep-pen (this is the fault
of the harbour authorities, not of the "La Marguerite"
Company), being done to rags by the blazing sun, scorched,
baked, but of course not on all sides, as head and shoulders
got the worst of it. It was courting sunstrokes. At last, three
quarters of an hour late, in came the merry and majestic
Marguerite, we feeling towards her more like Mephistopheles
than Faust. On our next visit the ticket distributor was in
the bathing-machine-like office quite fifteen minutes before the
time advertised for starting, and there was no crowding; but
the absence of protection from the sun's rays was notable. And
how utterly hopeless this unprotected situation would be in
a " surprise" pelting shower!
"Once aboard the lugger and we were free!" It was
delightful. It was "alittle bit of all right," as a jovial tourist
who had previously joined the ship at Margate, observed. But
if anything could do harm to a pleasant day, it was having been
compelled to wait for the unpunctual opening of the ticket-office,
and being detained for three quarters of an hour in *he broiling
sun, where we boys stood on the burning stones, which were
like hot bricks to our poor fried soles, without any awning,
and only a few benches.
Mr. Punch, Sir, we wish well to the merry Marguerite, her
crew and company, and to our noble friend The Pier of Rams-
gate, and if you, Sir, will only give these pier officials a stir
up with your baton, just a playful poke in the ribs, we are
certain they will recognise the justice of complaints which do
not come from grumblers but from well-wishers.
Ramsgate, which ashore is capable of considerable improve-
ment, as also, we should imagine, is its Local Board of Manage-
ment or Town Council, or whatever the supreme authority may
be, is now well provided with Boat Services, among others
being one running to and from Folkestone, per combined
forces of L. C. & D. and S. E. boats, calling at Deal and Dover
en route, and continuing the voyage to Margate on the
return. This is a service that, with a very little attention
given to the times and seasons, and to the cuisine, which is in
the hands of an experienced steward (we've come across him
before now, same Service, other boats), ought, as a distinct
feature of the K.C.B. ("Kent Coasting Boats"), to become
highly and deservedly popular.
At Folkestone the voyager has plenty of time to mount to the
big hotel, the Metropolc, or, if he would take it very easily,
he can remain en has at the Imperial, where, on the occasion
of our visit, there was a lunch excellent in quality but parsi-
monious in quantity, though no doubt wo could have had all
we required if, like Oliver Twist, we had only "asked for
more." But wo didn't, except as to tomatoes, and these were
so frugally served (though deliciously done), being neatly
divided into two slices for each person (tomatoes, you see, are
so dear! !), that we summoned up courage to implore one of the
extremely superior waiters, who had all the chastened air of
men ready at any moment to undertake an order for an expen-

sive funeral, to repeat the dose of "tomatoes for three." In
about five minutes he returned, quietly and sorrowfully,
"bringing his sheaves with him" in the shape of two more
thin slices of tomatoes! It must have gone to the cook's heart,
or the larder-maid's heart, to part with them! And there
was no extra charge in the bill! Fancy that! So we were
thankful for small mercies, and cheerfully paid three shillings
for four lemon-squashes (two of us were thirsty souls), and two
shillings for two "goes" of whisky, which at a club would
have amounted to eightpence or tenpence at the most. How-
ever, "live and let live." And so for the present, until more
"complaints " induce us to seek Dr. Punch for a cure, we beg
to remain (here).

Toothsome.—Sir J. Crichton Browne, proposing the health of
the Dental Association last week, observed that "the age in
which we lived was one of dental debility." "The age to
which some of us live" would have been more accurate, in
another sense of "age." He also said that the new century
"must look well to the teeth of its people." Quite so: it may
not be long ere we shall be among the nations who have " to
show their teeth," and prove they can bite as sharply as they
can bark loudly. At the present and at anytime the artist who
can most painlessly and most skilfully " draw teeth" is to be
reckoned among the greatest benefactors of suffering mortals.'

"Which will you have, this or that?" asked the other,

The intruder pressed for particulars.
"Well," said Number One, "you will find the house suffi-
ciently comfortable, good and wholesome food, warm clothing,
and tobacco in moderation."
"That sounds well. And now, Sir, what can you do for me?"
"Your health is our first consideration."
"So it is with us," put in Official Number One. "Sanitary
considerations take precedence of everything else."
"Both tempting,"said the intruder, " and I should certainly
like admission."
"Well, the qualification is simple enough," said Number
One. "Are you a pauper?"
"No, not quite."
"Then are you a thief or any other kind of law breaker?"
queried Number Two.
"Sorry I am neither," answered the intruder; "I am
only an artizan out of work."
"Won't do for us. A stranger to the Relieving Officer,"
observed Number One.
"And unknown to the police," returned the other.
"Then what s/wflldo?"
"You mustanswer that question yourself," said Number One.
But Number Two was silent, feeling that it was no part
of his official duty to find a solution to conundrums.

It murders the unknown maestro with the maestro who's got
Yet I pity the poor assassin, for I know it cannot be free

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
FOR some time past, at brief intervals, Messrs. Newnes have
been issuing what they call The Library of Useful Stories. It
is not a kind of Tit-Bits of fiction. It is, in truth, a series of
erudite essays on subjects of every-day interest, written in a
style understanded of the people. Amongst earlier volumes
are The Story of Wild Flowers, The Story of Eclipses, The
Story of a Piece of Coal, and The Story of the Stars. The latest
issue, The Story of King Alfred, comes out just in time for the
millenary of England's Darling. When my Baronite adds that
the little book was written by Sir Walter Besant it touches
tautology to add that it is picturesquely written. To be sold
at a shilling each this library must have a very wide circulation
in order to pay. For those concerned for the spread of educa-
tion it is pleasant to think of so powerful an agency at work.
The conclusion that must inevitably be arrived at by any one
gifted with a true appreciation of the humorous during the perusal
of Some Experiences of an Irish R.M., by Messrs. Sohbrville and
Martin Ross (Longmans, Green & Co.), will be that the authors
have a faculty for seeing things not as others, mere ordinary
persons, see them, and of narrating them in so mirth-provoking
and original a fashion as to compel laughter where, as a matter
of fact, our sympathy with the sufferer or our annoyance with
the cause of his sufferings should have been the first sentiment
aroused in the breast of a spectator, as the reader is supposed
to be, of the scenes described. But not a bit of it! The
ludicrous side in every situation, fraught it may be with more
or less danger to life and limb, is always kept uppermost by
these two laughing Irish philosophers. Dulness is banished
from the opening of the book to the close thereof, though it
may be said that the choicest stories are at the commence-
ment, as the most attractive strawberries are to be found at
the top of the pottle. Since Charles Lever was at his best
with Harry Lorrequer, Cliarles O'Malley, Tom Burke of Ours,
and, may be, The Knight of Gwynne, no such rollicking Irish
book as this has appeared, at least not within the period where-
unto the memory of the Baron runneth not to the contrary.
Sheehan's My New Curate is as thoroughly Irish as this, but its
admirable humour is of a sedate and gentle character. Nothing
of a sedate or gentle character is to be found here: nearly every
story is calculated to "set the table in a roar," and to only one
of them is there anything like a serious and rather sensational
finish. As a mirth-provoker this book might be placed in the
same category with Many Cargoes and with The Lunatic at
Large, though this latter is rather a work of extravagantly
grotesque imagination, while Some Experiences deals with facts.
Over The Lisheen Races the Baron wept tears of laughter,
and would read no more that night, unless in the presence of
a surgeon, a nurse, and his own medical attendant, in case he
should "split his sides" and require an immediate opera-
tion to be performed by the deftest hands. The Baron does
not remember having laughed so heartily since he first learnt
how Mr. Pickwick drove the chaise with the horse in it that
"displayed various peculiarities," while Mr. Winkle bestrode
an animal that went up the street, "side first, with his head
towards one side of the way, and his tail to the other." The
book is as full of good things as a terrine de foie gras or
exquisitely made grouse-pudding.
Mr. Sydney Buxton has enlarged and, to a considerable
extent, re-written a couple of articles that appeared in the
spring in one of the monthly magazines, being a study of
Mr. Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. John
Murray publishes them in a convenient volume. It falls a few
pages short of two hundred, but it comprises within its boards
a marvellous chapter in the history of England. Between
Mr. Gladstone's first Budget speech, delivered in April, 1853,
and his last, spoken in July, 1882, there lies accomplishment of
national good unequalled by any statesman who has helped to
mould the destinies of the empire. Mr. Buxton, dealing with
a congenial subject, makes his book a model of lucidity. My
Baronite observes that forty years ago, as to-day, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and his colleagues of the
spending departments were at loggerheads. Speaking of the
Budget in 1861, DlZZY, in a characteristic outburst, contrasts
"a patriotic Prime Minister, appealing to the spirit of the
country, with his Chancellor of the Exchequer, whose duty is
to supply the ways and means by which those exertions are to
be supported, proposing votes with innuendo and recommending
expenditure in a whispered invective."
Some Literary Landmarks for Pilgrims on Wheels (Dent & Co.),
by Mr. E. W. Rockett, if not as brilliantly startling as the name
of the author would suggest, is a delightful little book, excep-
tionally valuable to Booky Bikers, who can carry it in a side
pocket, and, when resting for a while, can dip into it for mental
refreshment and profitable instruction. It is prettily illustrated
by J. A. Symmington. The Baron is not a Biker, but the country
through which this book takes us, with its old world stories
and pleasant recollections, would be an inducement to him to
take to cruising on wheels had he the leisure at his disposal
for perfecting himself in the Ixionic labour. With a pleasant
companion, too, there could be much interchange of thought,
as there is no rule of the road, as there is of the sea, against
speaking "to the man at the wheel," or, as it should be here
rendered, "to the man on the wheel."
The Baron can recommend My Lady's Diamonds (Ward,
Lock & Co.), by Adeline Sargent, as a novel potir passer le
temps when travelling by river, rail or road. It is an old theme,
perhaps, but the treatment is somewhat new, the hero is more
or less of a noodle, and the heroine is not a particularly
startling character. Still, 'twill serve when on a journey.
Apropos of "journeys," is there a better pocket series for
travellers than The Temple Classics (J. M. Dent & Co.)?—well
bound, simply but strongly, the latest of whicli considerable
collection is The Love Letters of Abelard and Heloise, "written,"
as "H.M." in his preface reminds us, "in Latin about the year
1128 and first published in Paris in 1610." The present trans-
lation, or rather paraphrase, which admirably conveys the
spirit of the original, was published in 1722. Immortal romance
of real life that as long as the world lasts must ever enlist the
sympathy of even the most austerely virtuous for these bitterly
punished victims of human frailty and of fiendish revenge.
Let us, in a cooler season of the year, visit the tomb of
Abelard and Heloise in the cemetery of Pere Lachaise, and,
like "the soldier" who "leant upon his sword and wiped

IN MEMORIAM.
IJ.ff. TBittma.
GERMAN EMPRESS, PRINCESS ROYAL OF ENGLAND.
Bohn, Nov. 21, 1810. Died, Aug. 5, 1901.
Froved Royal by the courage, bright, serene,
That bore through lingering pain the lonely test,
Not far behind her feet, your Mother-Queen
You follow to your rest.
Daughter of England, gentle, brave and wise,
Who looked to play that high Imperial part
Which should have linked by Love's and Nature's ties
The lands that shared your heart;—
Ah! might you have your will, then Death's own hand,
That set upon your throne so swift a doom,
Through memory yet shall bind these two that stand
To-day above your tomb.
THE WAY THEY WILL HAVE WITH THE ARMY.
(A Rip-Van-Winklein peep into the Future.)
The hundred years had passed rapidly. Rip, before going
to sleep, had taken the latest patent remedy for preserving
tissue, and came to himself as fresh as over. Things had
not changed very much during his slumber. The same old
aerial navigation, wireless telegraphy, dwelling atmospheres
(the substitute for board and residence), and the rest of it. Ho
willed, and his brain-wave took him into a palace.
"Why are you here?" he asked a gentleman who was
covered with silver, gold and precious stones.
"Because I prefer it," was tho languid reply."
"What is your income?" queried Rrp with a curiosity the
outcome of transatlantic extraction.
"A couple of thousand ayear or so and perquisites," was the
reply, languid as before.
"Are you a Cabinet Minister?"
"No—one infinitely more important, a soldier."
"I see; so in the twenty-first century this is the manner in
which a field-marshal exists?"
"No, you aro wrong," said the soldier, "I am not a field-
marshal, but a private. 1 cost a good deal—in fact, as you
may imagine, many thousands. But I am told I am cheap at
the price."
"Cheap at the price? Why?"
"Yes, because we really can't afford conscription."
"THE YICIOUS CIRCLE."
Oh, tell me not 1 've lost my appetite,
This is a world of melancholy truth:
"Alas!" quoth I, "that which did once invite
Was but the stomach of Digestivo Youth!"
In vain I strove to eat at—well, say fifty,—
As eat I used when I was twenty-one;
Starving, I could but drink, and, mixed and thrifty,
Weep for results of chops so overdone.
In vain I murmured, "Eat and drink one hath to:"
So quoth the cat that swalloweth the bird;
Tho bird, arising from his morning bath, too,
Eats up the worm before it can be heard.
The worm but turns in righteous indignation,
And, to console himself as best he may,
Says, " They bad men, by order of creation,
Peed on wo beasties, till we feed on They."
God makyth man ; man dog unkindly beateth;
Dog chivieth cat (explain it how you can,
The circle goes full round); then cat bird eateth;
Bird swalloweth worm, and worm devoureth Man.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EmtAOTID PROM THB DlABY OF TOBT, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, August 5.—
Efforts have been made from time to
time by belated writers to picture the
Markiss's manner of speech when he
stands at Table of House. Braye (the

The Markiw murmurs into the privacy of hie
waistcoat.
Baron not the Vicar), with unconscious
humour to-night tumbled upon description
which for graphicness and accuracy the
most skilful penman could not beat.
Speaking on third reading of Koyal
Declaration Bill, Braye brought startling
accusation against the Markiss. "The
noble lord," he said, "when referring to
the doctrine of transubstantiation lowered
his voice, inclined his head, and spoke in
a deeply reverential spirit."
The Markiss jumped up and, for him,
hotly denied the description. "The
noble lord," he observed, " said I lowered
my voice and inclined my head. He is
quite mistaken. I deny it."
All the same it is literally and exactly
true. Only, tone and gesture had nothing
to do with transubstantiation. The trick
might have happened at the moment the
word was pronounced, and caught the
watchful eye of Lord Braye. That is the
more likely since it is recurrent at least
once in every five minutes of the Markiss's
speech. He goes along pretty audibly for
ten or a dozen sentences; then down drops
his massive chin on his manly breast, and
to the anguish of the laboriously listening
audience the final clause of the sentence,
often the most important, is murmured into
the privacy of his waistcoat.
Lord Braye's mistake, delightful for
its elaborate comicality, will have its
uses if it brings home to the Markiss
the inconvenience of a mannerism that
sometimes reaches the proportions of a
public calamity.
Business done.—In the Commons Amurath
to Amurath succeeds. We have for a
while lost Sam Smith; we have found
Sproston Caine. Samuel, it will be re-
membered, used to prowl about Piccadilly
at midnight, or haunt the stage door of
the music halls, coming down to the
House, and making its flesh creep with
horror at recital of things he had seen
and heard. Sproston, according to his
own account, has been lavishing his
pennies in looking up naughty things
hidden in the recesses of mutoscopes.
Home Secretary so interested in the
enterprise that, taking his tip from
Sproston, he has spent all his pocket-
money.
"The hon. Member," he ruefully said
just now, "referred me to the Strand. I
paraded up and down the Strand one
whole afternoon and detected nothing. T
have spent the best part of this Bank
Holiday trying to find these pictures. I
saw many picture boxes, surrounded by
urchins, and spent several pennies in look-
ing into them, but I did not see one single
thing that any human being could possibly
object to."
This vision of Ritchie hovering round
mutoscope with other street urchins, feel-
ing in his pockets to see if he had got
another penny, tenderly toying with it,
finally making up his mind, hastily drop-
ping it in the slot, bending his eye to
level of peephole, and then being dis-
appointed, was hailed by unsympathetic
House with roars of laughter.
Tuesday night.—The Hughligans broke
out to-night. John o'Gorst, epitome of
harmless respectability, taking an after-
noon walk after leaving a card on the
Committee of the Council of Education,
suddenly set upon; his hat beaten over
his brow; his ribs punched; his whiskers
pulled; his body left for dead in the
lonely furrow that lies between the pave-
ment and the roadway and is collo-
quially known as the gutter.
All this, of course, in a Parliamentary
sense. What actually happened was that
Hugh Cecil and his more or less merry
men made up their minds to prevent the
building of a new Board School at Step-
ney. John o'Gorst, as representative of
the Board of Education, had arranged
everything for the purchase of a site.
Provisional Order confirmed in Com-
mittee; Bill came up this afternoon
for consideration on Report stage. If it
passed all was lost; Board School would
forthwith be built. If they could get
the Bill re-committed, on whatever ex-
cuse, delay would, at this period of
Session, be fatal, and the evil day of
erection of another Board School in Lon-
don would be put off for twelve months.
Lord Hugh Cecil accordingly met his
boys at midnight, by a coffee stall, in
quiet street at Greenwich. All arranged.
When Bill called on to-day Evans Gordon,
Major (retired), put up to make frontal
attack. At the right moment, Hugh
Cecil came up on the flank, and the
pounding began. Accused JOHN o'Gorst
of "surreptitious proceedings"; with
indignant gesture of angry hand toward
the Treasury Bench, on which sat Brother
Cranborne, Cousin Arthur, and Cousin
Gerald, declared that it was the only
part of the House where honourable un-
derstandings were not kept.
Effect of scene on Squire of Malwood
quite painful. In voice choked with
emotion, he protested that never had he
seen the House fallen so low as when,
charges of this kind brought against
the King's Ministers, no reply was forth-
coming. This interposition wrought magic
results on Lord HUGH. Ran over and
knelt by side of prostrate Vice President
of the Council; helped him to his feet;
smoothed his hair; brushed his clothes;
promised him a new coat of red paint for
his bicycle.
"If," he protested, "I have said any-
thing that is capable of being interpreted
as reflecting on Sir JOHN Gorst, I with-
draw it. I have the warmest sense of the
fairness and honesty he always displays."
Here he tenderly removed a flake of
mud from the right hon. gentleman's left
whisker.
"Urn," said the Squire of Malwood,
"wish I hadn't spoken. Rather spoiled
a promising little game."
Business done.—The Hughligans ruth-
lessly assault John o' Gorst.
Friday night.—I sometimes ask the Mem-
ber for Sark what has become of Frank
Hugh O'Donnell. Twenty years ago he
was, perhaps, the most brilliant of the
band of Irish obstructionists who reduced
obstruction to a science, and showed how a
few men, some of them illiterate, all reso-
lute, unscrupulous, could defy and defame
the Mother of Parliaments. The answer
comes to-day in a little book published

Gorst succumbs to the Chief of the " Hughligins."

[August 14, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
by John Long, entitled The Message of
the Masters. Frank Hugh, like Mr.
Silas Wegg, has dropped into poetry. The
theme of the verso is the legend, dear to
Irishmen, which tells how within the
bosom of the Mount of Aileach are buried
the ruins of the stately summer palace of
the northern kings of Ireland, who, silent
amid their slumbering hosts, watch for
the dawning of the day when they shall
lead forth their warriors to deliver Ireland
from the yoke of the Saxon.
Prank Hugh's verse has all the finish
and far more of the fire of his prose
speeches. Written in the rhythm of
Macaulay's ballads, there are some verses
the Master might have, been proud to
have penned. I gather that the former
Member for Dungarvan does not think
much of the present Irish Parliamentary
Party. Even Parnell did not please him.
To his memory he dedicates the following
lines :—
A shape of lath and plaster had late been leader
there,
With puppetry and paint-work to set the folk
astare.
There came a wind of judgment, and lo! its place
was bare.
In a supplement of historical notes and
explanations, not the least interesting
portion of the little book, this is admitted
to refer to Charles Stbwaht Parnell,
"a penniless "Wicklow squire of English
descent.'' But who is this ?—
We marked a burst of cheering that hailed a
bloated slave
The Seller of our exiles from Clyde to London's
wave.
The Talkers cheered the Knaving; the throng
acclaimed the knave.
And this ?—
And still, and still a Talker, with Ghetto shekels
paid,
Where Moy looks South on Galway, his sordid
mobsmen bade
Refuse the County Honour to Ireland's New
Brigade.
And who can this be ?—
Still prosing and still posing 1 Like pedant from
hedge school,
Came one, sour faced with envy, incompetent to
rule,
To show no fool in motley can match a Dismal
Fool.
What Frank Huon can't abear is the
making of long speeches in the House of
Commons. As he puts it—
The Chiefs are hot with hating the noisome Night
of Words,
The Chiefs are wild with waiting the leaping
Light of Swords.
Yet Sark remembers Frank Hugh
making a two hours' speech in his first
Session. Also he remembers one night
iu June, 1880, when F. H., in the middle
of the Question Hour, moved the adjourn-
ment, in order to attack Challemel-
Laoour, just named French Ambassador
at the Court of St. James's, leading to
talk which lasted till one o'clock the
next morning. Other times, other O'Don-
nell's. To-day none so fierco as he in
flagellation of the Tribe of Talkers.
Business done.—Report of Supply driven
through.
PIEVE DI CADORE.
Twenty-five miles from a railway
station, and without electric light or gas,
Pieve di Cadore, the birthplace of Titian,
remains old-fashioned. One can sit out-
side the Hotel Progresso, and watch the
dusty travellers arriving in dusty
carriages with the luggage tied on
behind, as in the time of Dickens's
Pictures from Italy. A vettura pubblica,
a degenerate descendant of the old dili-
gence, arrives four times a day. It is
only an omnibus with two seats in front,
but it is inscribed Mesnaggeria Postale,
it is painted bright yellow, and it does
its best to look as old as possible. As for
the three horses in it, they look as old as
possible without any trying. They seem
to date back to the time of Dickens at
least, if not of Titian himself.
The name of the Hotel Progresso is
possibly unique. Its progress, as regards
slowness, is much the same. However,
it has reached a point of tolerable com-
fort, and, being able to accommodate
eighty people, it has just bought a second
hip-bath. It boasts already of a plunge
bath—a cement tank in the floor of an
out-house approached through the garden.
The comfort of this bath is somewhat
diminished by the fact that the cold-water
tap leaks and squirts a thin, but powerful,
stream of water into the air. The
stranger, on entering, naturally en-
deavours to turn off the tap, with the
result that the squirt of water is diverted
on to him, and gives him a pleasant
shower-bath before he has taken his
clothes off.
But one forgets all these trifling imper-
fections in the delightful climate of Pieve
di Cadore, which is as nearly perfect as
possible. An Italian sky and a southern
sunshine are blended with the pure air of
three thousand feet above the sea. It is
just the happy medium between baking
Belluno to the south, and cloudy Cortina or
shivering Schluderbach to the north. In
Cortina, with over 3,000 inhabitants, it is
impossible to buy a book or a newspaper
of any country whatever. The place is so
benighted, so literally in the clouds, that
even the clocks are permanently wrong.
Marvellous to relate they are not slow,
but fast—twenty minutes ahead of Vienna.
It is possible that Cortina, never seeing a
book or a newspaper, has never heard of
Central European Time, but how it gets
its clocks twenty minutes fast, unless it
regulates them by the moon, is moro than
one can discover. At Pieve di Cadore, in
poor, ignorant Italy, with only eight
hundred poor, ignorant inhabitants, one
can buy a Venetian paper daily, and in
the shop where pins and needles, toys,
thread, matches, picture post-cards and
other trifles are sold, one can even buy a
book. It is not much of a book, but it is
more than you could get in Cortina, un-
less you telegraphed to Vienna for it.
Pieve di Cadore has but one defect,
shared with other Italian towns. The
inhabitants seem to require no sleep.
Before five in the morning they ring the
church bells, terrific bells, certainly
audible two miles away. This is the
morning programme:
4.45 a.m. — Church bells for three
minutes.
5.0.—Just as one is settling off to sleep
again, clock of Municipio strikes. It is
a very loud clock. Second attempt to
fall asleep again.
5.2.—Clock of church strikes. Also a
loud one.
5.10, or thereabouts. — Animated con-
versation of inhabitants just under bed-
room window. They were talking outside
till 11 P.M. Crowing of cocks.
5.30.—Banging of doors in corridor, and
departure of first travellers leaving to-
day. Much conversation in loud voices.
Shouts in various languages—Italian,
German, American. Crashes of heavy
luggage on floors. Creaking of brakes on
wheels of carriages descending hill. Also
bells, cocks, dogs, swifts and others.
6.0.—Day's work well begun. Renewed
movements of vehicles, of luggage, of
travellers. General chorus of cocks,
clocks, dogs, swifts, servants and in-
habitants generally. Occasional solo by
a donkey. Last hope of sleep finally
abandoned. Get up.
7.0.—Bells and clocks. After this a
profound peace settles down upon the
Piazza Tiziano. The few people about
seem to converse softly. An occasional
vehicle passing is hardly noticeable.
The bells are rung no more. Even the
clocks appear to strike more gently. But
it is too late to go to bed again when one
is up and dressed.
After two such awakenings, it became
evident that the only way to get some
sleep was to go to bed at nine. Un-
fortunately I came to this conclusion on a
Sunday, when the town band, with brass
instruments of vast power and a mighty
drum, performed a selection of music
under my windows till 10.30 p.m., and so
completely aroused the already wakeful
inhabitants that they remained on the
piazza discussing the performance till
midnight. On Monday the enterprising
proprietor of the Caffe Tiziano, opposite,
had engaged two comic singers, who sang
with immense energy, accompanied by a
harmonium, from nine in the evening until
some late hour, which complete exhaustion
prevented me from recording. I only
know that they had finished when the
church bells woke me at a quarter to five
on Tuesday morning. H. D. B.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
SORROWS OF PATERFAMILIAS AT THE SEASIDE.
Part II.
Four of my offspring joined me on tlie sands.
Willy and Johnny expressed a desire to paddle; 'whilst
Molly and Charlie were equally determined to buy pails,
spades and nets. I, personally, should have preferred remaining
on the beach, but
The contest ended in tears on one side, triumph on the other,
and a forced march upon the toyshop in the High Street. It
struck me that, judging by the varied assortment of smells,
the High Street -was aptly named. Near the toy-shop we met
my eldest boy puffing at a cigarette. I frowned warningly, but
ALGERNON exclaimed: "Oh, it's all right, Gov'nor; the Mater
will never know if you don't tell her."
I sighed, and entered the shop. Amid a clamour of infantile
cries, I fitted out the children with nets, boats, cheap bathing
dresses, and canvas shoes.
Then we again repaired to the beach. The children all
paddled, except ALGERNON, who turned rather green, and said
he didn't care for the seaside, and that he thought the journey
down had disagreed with him. "We returned, at length, to
what is euphemistically designated a high tea, sandy, dirty and
sticky.
Marion had "put things to rights"—whatever that may
mean—we retired to bed early, and awoke to a bright,
sunny day. The only drawbacks to the enjoyment of our
breakfast were that the eggs were hard, and the bacon uneatable.
The tea had apparently been made with tepid water, too. But
we had not come to Cockleton to eat but to enjoy the sight of
the azure sea. It was not azure; it was of a faded pea-soup
colour ; but that was a detail.
Shortly after breakfast we started for the beach, laden with
camp-stools, milk-buns, sponge cakes, pears, bananas, bathing-
dresses, towels, pails and spades, toy boats and fishing-nets,
brushes and combs. I carried most of these things—dear
Marion is so flattering in the confidence she reposes in me,
as evidenced by her desire that I should personally take charge
of most, if not all, of our belongings. I walked a little in
advance, so that Marion should be able to see if I dropped
anything en route.
We reached the sands and spread our impedimenta on the
ground. Selecting my wife's waterproof, I was laying it out
preparatory to sitting on it, when a yell from Marion apprised
me that the baby was underneath, having been temporarily
deposited there by Nurse. How I could be so careless
Marion could not understand. I smiled broadly, and Marion
said I was a brute.
About 10 a.m. we began to think of bathing, and I was
to ascertain how soon we could obtain possession of two bathing
machines in close proximity. Bathing-machine man grumpy,
'Ow did 'e know when the machines was goin' to be empty!
'Ow did 'e know when the "parties" was coroin' aout! Pro-
pitiated him with sixpence, after which he thought that
Twenty-four and Twenty-six would be ready in a 'arf-hour.
Returned. For once, Marion quite pleased with me. So
astonished, almost choked myself with milk-bun.
The "parties" finally emerged from Twenty-four and Twenty-
six, almost at same moment. I and four boys took Twenty-four,
whilst Nurse and three younger ones went into Twenty-six.
Baby left in charge of our small nursemaid, under supervision
of Marion, on sand.
Space extremely limited. I got in first. Water extremely
cold. Algernon insists on diving from machine. Does so, and
hits his head against the sand. Marion screams from shore to
ask why I allowed him to do such a dangerous thing. Two
youngest boys cling to each other and decline to come into
water at all. Stand at foot of steps persuading, and getting
very cold.
"C-c-c-come along, boys; it's n-n-n-not at all c-c-c-cold t" My
teeth were rattling, and giving the lie direct to my assertion.
Willy at length puts toe in and rushes back. Have to carry
him out screaming. Dip him, and thereby earn his undying
distrust. Same process with Charlie. Tommy adventurous,
and gets out of his depth. Rush in, and drag him out—much
the pluckiest, and quickly begins enjoyiDg himself. All the rest
follow suit, and,desperately cold, I scrambled back into bathing
machine, seized rough towel and began to rub life into my
perished frame again. Door suddenly opens, and Nurse—who
has mistaken Twenty-four for Twenty-six—rushes in and shuts
door after her. Situation too horrible for words. She gives
weird shriek, and flies out again. Very trying, but suppose
accidents will happen in best reg Dear Marion hammering
at door. Why don't I make Algernon and TOMMY come in?
Really, she thought I could have no authority at all! Reply
that I quite agree with her; don't think I have. Nevertheless,
shout to boys:
"Your mother says you are to come in, at once 1"
"No fear!" is the graceless and extremely vulgar reply.
What can I do more?
Dress and return to beach, and Marion, In cold tones, asks,
"How was it that you and Nurse were in same machine?"
Explain. Regret to find dear Marion unreasoning and
sceptical.
Succeed at length in explaining, but noticed, nevertheless,
that Nurse received month's warning. Perksley dropped in that
evening—unfortunately, table was being laid for supper—and,
all our efforts to dislodge him proving abortive, he stopped and
shared meal with us.
Dear Marion, in stony silence, rose at nine p.m., bowed,
and stalked majestically off, leaving me to entertain our guest
until half-past eleven, when, having smoked two of my cigars
and consumed nearly a third of whisky bottle, he rose, patted
me familiarly on shoulder, asked me to excuse him for running
away so early, and promised to "drop in another night, soon."
If he does drop in I drop out.
Low tide in morning, and we made for the rocks. I caught a
prawn, and a small green crab caught WILLY. His screams
were heartrending, until I had succeeded in releasing his finger
from the nipping crustacean embrace, which was immediately
transferred to me. I smashed crab on rock, taking the skin off
my knuckles in doing so.
Resumed operations, and made discoveries—amongst them,
that sitting down on green seaweed-covered rocks, whether
voluntarily or the reverse—most frequently the latter—is not
improving to white flannel trousers. Johnny, reaching out too
far over a rock, overbalanced and fell in. Wet through. Fear-
ing dear Marion's displeasure, I told him wo must go home at
once. Indignant protests from children. What ought father
of family to do under these embarrassing circumstances?
Finally decide on taking Johnny home, despite struggles, and
entrust rest of children to Algernon. Algernon hardly rises
to situation—says something about "Blooming rot!" Look
severe, but Algernon only laughs. Wish he wouldn't. So
hurtful. Ignore laugh, and start home, leading Johnny by
hand. Ho kicks and screams, until I threaten him with condign
punishment. At this, he roars still more loudly, and I substi-
tute promise of chalky looking sweetstuff, which we obtain at
shop just off beach. We reach home without further trouble.
Dear Marion looks reproachfully at me, and asks in despairing
tones why it is that I can never be trusted out with the children
alone? Was immediately sent back to find the others, whilst
Marion and Nurse took Johnny in hand. Up to present, feel
that my brief sojourn at seaside has hardly afforded me the
rest I had hoped for.
When I again found boys, Algernon had dropped some way
behind rest to smoke cigarette and make eyes at pretty
nursemaid. Again ignored his fatuous conduct, but care-
fully took him by arm and led him on with me. Discovered

my other little ones playing with that odious creature's,
Perksley's, youngsters—so embarrassing, as Marion had parti-
cularly warned mo against permitting this. Wish dear Marion
■were here. Thought best plan was to adjourn to early dinner.
Did so, in spite of vigorous protests, and got children home,
exhausted—1 mean
that I was.
Algernon in-
formed us, as we
were struggling
with our under-
done, tepid leg of
mutton, and cab-
bage tasting of
soapsuds, that
there would be a
cricket match that
afternoon on the
sands. He and
Willy were to
play.
Welcomed this,
as promising quiet
hour in which to
read and indulge
in contemplative
pipe. Baby would
be asleep—I hoped
—and Marion ly-
ing down — I
trusted. Boys and
Molly rushed
away, after meal,
to sands, whilst
Marion bustled
upstairs to nur-
sery, and I lit pipe
and settled down
to previous day's
newspaper. Began
to think that, after
all, seaside life
very restful, when
Willy rushed in
and requested me
to come and "make
up" the needed
eleven for the
Visitors — match
being "Visitors v.
Residents. Pro-
tested that as I
had not played
cricket for twenty
years the thing
was impossible.
Willy inexorable.
"You must come;
you'll have to! Wo
must have one
more feller to make I
up—they told mo to say that any rotter would do!" Very
flattering, this. Have to give in, and repair to sands forth-
with.
Visitors win toss and take first innings. Our "captain"—
aspiring youth of sixteen—consults ALGERNON as to order of
going in. Algernon replies airily, "Oh, shove the gov'nor in
anywhere. He's hopeless!" Smile pleasantly, but feel both
annoyed and nervous. When my turn came for action felt
more nervous still.

Mr. Punch. "Make yotjb mind easy, Sib Christopher, I'll keep an eye on it."
[" Ween never dreamt of the desperate attacks the sandy substratum would have to sustain."
Daily Paper.]
I hit wildly at first ball, but was unaware that success had
crowned my efforts, until a very Babel of shouts warned me
to "Run it out, Sir!" and, like one possessed, I capered up
and down the "pitch," until my mad career was prematurely
cut short by the ball, dexterously hurled at my wicket, missing
it, and hitting me,
with great force,
on the trouser.
Rubbed injured
part ruefully, and
again "took
guard." Once more
did I strike with
savage force at
the unseen: but
this time my bat
only snicked the
flying missile,
which went into
the hands of
"slip," and I
was out. Thankful
that nothing worse
had happened, I
retired from wic-
kets, sore and
bruised, but still
triumphant, as I
had hit a four,
anyhow. Ironical
cheers greeted me
on my return, and
our captain — the
youth before al-
luded to — patted
me patronisingly on
back, and said that
"for an old buffer,
I really wasn't so
bad, after all." I
may here remark
that this young
gentleman himself
had been bowled
first ball.
Fielding some-
what tiresome, and
lasted throughout
afternoon. I missed
three catches, was
o'penly execrated
by rest of Visitors'
team — consisting,
mostly, of small
boys—was struck
on nose in attempt-
ing to field lofty
hit; declined to go
into sea in pursuit

CRICKET PROSPECTS FOR 1902.
[" First-claw cricket, properly organised and
run as an attractive variety-Bhow, would be a fine
paying concern."—An American financier to an
Interviewer.]
Thr Anglo-American "Willow-and-
Leather" Syndicate (President: Mr.
I'IKUPOINT MORGAN; capital, ten million
dollars) beg to intimate that their season
will open at Lord's on the lrst of April.
They have obtained an exclusive lease of
this well-kuown ground, aud their list of
star artists fairly licks creation.
Turnstiles open at 7 a.m. No free
passes. One continuous round of amuse-
ment from 9 A.M. to 0 P.M. Program for
each day of the opening week :—
9 A.M.—Prince Ranji and Lord HAW KB
will take center. These aristocratic
willow-wielders will then demonstrate on
slow half-volleys, putting on 200 runs in
the hour. Positively no disappointment.
However often they are bowled or caught,
they will continue to whack the sphere
until the hour bo expired. The Prince
and the Peer every morning from nine to
ten!
10—11.—Grand exhibition of bowling
and fielding by tho united Yorkshire
troupe. (Specially and exclusively en-
gaged.) Rhodes, Haigu and Hirst will
perform the celebrated Hat Trick. There
are no spots on the Yorkshire bowlers!
11—11.30.—Comic interlude, entitled
"No-Ball; or, The Doubtful Deliverer and
the Umbraged Umpire." Messrs. Mold
and James Philips have been booked at
fabulous cost to give this screamingly-
funny performance each day of the open-
ing week.
11.30—12.30. — Charles B. Fry will
lecture on "The Use and Abuse of the
Leg-glance." The glory of C. B. as the
champion cricketing word-spinner needs
no polish to increase its glitter. Wise
words from a bravo batsman daily at
11.30! (Schools admitted to this turn at
reduced fees.)
12.30—2.0. — The Champion Midgets!
Splendid show by Messrs. Abel and Quaife.
Skill Dersiis size. The little wonders will
smack the pilule to the boundary every
time. Followed by Abel's celebrated
turn: "How I walk back to the Pavilion."
Howls of delighted applause!
From 2 to 3.—The entire troupe will be
fed in the Pavilion, aud the public will be
admitted to view the fascinating scene.
But the practice of offering the performers
buns and lumps of sugar is very dangerous
and cannot be permitted.
;°cisely.—Dr. W. G. Grace will
v?ay into the field, and will give
his world-renowned performance, including
the Deep-Square-Leg Trick, the Scratch-
iug-the-ground-with-a-Bail Trick, etc., etc.
At tho conclusion of his turn he will be
umpired out "l.b.w." to a leg-break, and
will then speak a stirring monologue.
(Copyright strictly reserved.)
4— 5. — The Oxford and Cambridge
elevens will play tip-and-run. The scene
on the ground will be a careful reproduc-
tion of the famous'Varsity match. Beauty
and brightness will be seated on real
drags; Peers (warranted hall-marked),
Cabinet Ministers and Judges will watch
the proceedings from the pavilion. Real
triple-distilled essence of British Aris-
tocracy will pervade this turn. Huge
attraction for vistors from the States.
5— 6.—America versus England. Magni-
ficent International Match. America will
be represented by (among others) Fry,
Hayward, Jessop, Palairbt, Hearne, etc.
(all of whom conclusively can show Ameri-
can descent. Their pedigrees have been
made specially for the Syndicate, and are
unquestionably genuine.) England will
number among its foremost champions
Messrs. Timson, Snooks, Stubbs, etc., of
the Lower Pottlebury Cricket Club.
America will win I The Supremacy of the
Eagle over the Decrepit Lion will be
established daily! Unique scene!
The whole of the troupe will join in
singing "The Star-Spangled Banner"

"Very sorry," replied the waiter,
"but it's against the rules of the

"What do you mean, sirrah?" ex-
claimed the Person.
"From your dress," continued the
waiter, "I take you to be a drum-major
of artillery, and we cannot serve N.C.O.'s
except when they appear in mufti."
"A drum-major of artillery!" indig-
nantly echoed the wearer of much em-
broidery. "Why, I am a Cabinet Minis-
ter!"
"Very sorry indeed, Sir," returned the
waiter more respectfully, "but I'm much
afraid I can't serve you. You see our
orders are strict, not to serve anyone out
of mufti. No discourtesy intended to you
personally, Sir, I am sure, Sir, but"
"Merely an insult to His Majesty's

"Well, Sir, that does seem about the
size of it."
And the man made the admission be-
cause he was only a waiter and not a

PERPETUAL YODTH.
[" Prof. Gautieb, of the Inatitut de Franca,
bat isolated the bacteria of physical fatigue, which
he find* is a poison strongly resembling ptomaine
in nature. From this he deduces that fatigue can,
by the use of disinfectants, be avoided like any
other poison, and consequently man, no longer
euifering from wear and tear, need not weaken or
age."—Evening Frets Agency.]
When streaks of silver I descry
Mid looks that once were raven called,
■When candid mirrors tell me I
Am bald;
When furrows on my wrinkled phiz
I massage daily, but in vain,
I think, " It is not age—it is
Ptomaine."
Then let me not, like some great dunce,
Bewail my hapless lot because
I am not quite so young as once
I was;
But let me rather—if I can—
Entrap the germs, and down their throats
Gently but firmly force the an-
tidotes.
Then shall my limbs again be lithe,
My figure grow a thought less stout,
My swollen feet no longer writhe
"With gout;
Smooth, smooth shall be this wrinkled
brow,
And oh, it will be passing sweet
To don my youthful hose that now
"Won't meet.

Instead of panting as I climb
Herne Hill;
And famous victories I '11 win

The sports of youth no more enjoy,
I still shall love my football, quite

AT GORING.
Where is the sweetest river reach,
With nooks well worth exploring,
Wild woods of bramble, thorn and beech
Their fragrant breath outpouring?
Where does our dear secluded stream
Most gaily gleam?
At Goring.
Where sings the thrush amid the fern?
Where trills the lark upsoaring?
Where build the timid coot and hern,
The foot of man ignoring?
Where sits secure the water vole
Beside her hole?
At Goring.
Where do the stars dramatic shine
'Mid satellites adoring?
And where does fashion lunch and dine
Al fresco, bored and boring?
Where do we meet confections sweet
And toilets neat?
At Goring.
Where are regattas? Where are trains
Their noisy crowds outpouring?
And bands discoursing hackneyed strains,
And rockets skyward soaring?
Where is this urbs in rure ?—where
This Cockney Pair?
At Goring.
"VENICE, LIMITED."
Down by road from Pieve di Cadore,
along the valley of the Piave to Belluno,
where it is raining. Pieve, Piave, piove.
However, this is nothing unusual at
Belluno, where it rains every afternoon,
according to account. It is admitted
even by the waiter, who tries to speak
three languages in one breath, and
startles one with rapid exclamations such
as ""Vino-du-vin-some-wine?" He ad-
mits it sorrowfully and breathlessly.
"Si-oui-yass," says he. If it were not so
rainy Belluno would be a very pleasant
place, but one is not tempted to linger,
and the truthful waiter, with "Buon-
v iaggio-signore-bon - jou r - monsieur - good-
bye," sees me start for Venice.
Venice in August. Friendly fellow-
travellers, aghast, have warned me
solemnly of fearful heat, of terrible
odours, of maddening mosquitos. They
were all wrong. I saw one mosquito,
and counted him carefully. As for the
heat, it was nothing like London or Paris.
Summer is the time for Venice, rather
than the autumn, when one shivers in a
gondola.
But there will not be much left of
Venice after a short time, for it is gradu-
ally becoming one large show, run by
English companies. A little extension,
a final amalgamation, and "Venice,
Limited," would offer its shares to the
public. Then the poor, shabby, old-
fashioned parts of the city, where no
tourists, no picture post-cards, no hideous,
gimcrack souvenirs are to be seen, could
all be swept away. The dingy little
canals could be filled in, and used for
electric tramways. Every campo could
have its switchback railway or its music-
hall. Then Venice would be perfect. The
English and Americans would stay in
hotels, on Italian territory, where no
Italian dish would ever be seen. They
would live on grilled chops, Irish stew,
roast beef, plum puddings, and pancakes,
exactly as they do at home. The Germans
would stay in similar hotels and live on
Kaltes Aufschnitt, Kartoffelnsalat, Wiener
Schnitzel, Compot, Bier, und so wetter.
The name of polenta would be forgotten,
and everyone in the city would speak
English or German.
"Venice, Limited 1" It is a fascinating
prospect. That absurd, undulating old
floor in St. Mark's would be up in no
time, and the Company's Mosaic Depart-
ment would lay an elegant, modern floor,
tested with spirit levels. The climb to
the top of the Campanile is preposterous;
the Company's Lift Department would
soon alter that. The trip to the Lido by
water is tedious; a girder bridge and an
electric tram from the Piazzetta would
be an evident improvement. One insti-
tution would remain unaltered. The
pigeons of St. Mark's, those charming
little birds, exactly the same as the
pigeons of the British Museum, would
still afford amusement to simple-minded
tourists, who never look at a pigeon,
much less feed one, in New York, or
London, or Berlin. The Company's Grain
Department would supply the where-
withal to feed them, obtained from penny-
in-slot machines. And when the tourist
became, at last, a little weary of feeding
the pretty birds, the Company's gondola
would take him to one of the Company's
shops, and the Company's Souvenir De-
partment, or its Antiquities Department,
would sell him all that he might wish to
buy. And the Company's Forwarding
Department would send it to his home in
any part of the world.
Meanwhile, some trifling improvements
might bo made. A few seats, not of stone,
might be provided; some chairs, at a
penny or twopence, on the Piazza. There
cannot be a city anywhere with less seats
than Venice. Unless one sits outside a
cafd—and one does not require drinks or
ices at all hours of the day—one must sit
on the pavement. One very hot evening
I perceived a number of quiet, well-
dressed Italians sitting on the wide
plinth of St. Mark's, that plinth so solid
that it remains uninjured after, perhaps, a
thousand years of tumultuous history. I
joined them, and we sat peacefully, with-
out kicking the plinth or doing any
damage whatever. But soon there strolled
along one of those ridiculous little police-
men of Venice—caricatures of the London
policeman, in the same clothes, except
that a sword is carried, but short and
thin and stooping, exactly like a super,
dressed as a policeman, in a pantomime—
and gently told us to go. We yielded,
with protests, and the inoffensive super
strolled peacefully away. Of course, we
all had to adjourn to the cafes, in whose
interest this regulation is evidently made.
As for me, I sought such vengeance as
was possible. I went at once to the
Caffe Florian, ordered a glass of beer, the
cheapest drink obtainable, and sat stolidly
in front of it for two mortal hours. It
was rather wearisome, but I had my
revenge. H. D. B.
"TRANSFORMATIONS."
I.
One night the streets are fair and smooth,
the asphalte surface splendid,
The telephone has gone to rest, the navvy's
work is ended;
The 'bus, the hansom, and the bike
Can journey just where'er they like,
For now the roadway's mended.
But with the dawn there comes a
change;
From Charing Cross to Royal Exchange,
As far and wide as eye can range,
There's one vast excavation.
'Tis sewers, water, or the gas—
Result of ignorance most crass.
And some contractor who's an ass
Has wrought this transformation.
n.
One recollects the wayside inn, its snowy
floor well sanded,
Where good refreshment was dispensed
by Phyllis sweet, neat-handed.
With mirrors, parquetry and paint,
A stained-glass Bacchus—patron saint,
The place has been expanded.
Nous avons change" tout cela.
'Tis Hebe now behind the bar,
Who, pert as Comic Opera star, .
Expects her adoration.
To make the change was rather rash,
For all is done with borrowed cash;
Then comes a big distiller's smash—
Another transformation.
III.
Not long ago the sunny Squares, by lime
trees screened and hidden,
A rendezvous exclusive were, to wanderers
forbidden.
And little kids who trod the street
In tattered clothes and shoeless feet,
From Paradise were driven.
But nowadays our hearts decide
Humanity shall conquer pride,
So Eden's gates are opened wide
In welcome invitation, . '- - • ■ -
No longer from the waifs forlorn
We bar the pleasures of the lawn; -
They live, and no one dares to scorn.
This glorious transformation.

OBLIGING.
Lady (to village jobber, who for days ha* been " working " in the house). "Can you tell me

Village Jobber. "If you can tkll me, Mum, wheer I'm likely to oet another."
THE MILLIONAIRE'S LAMENT;
Or, The Impotence of Riches.
There are philosophers who state
That wealth, if not an actual bobble,
Is bound to prove, at any rate,
A source of almost endless trouble;
Veil, I was once content to bear
These trials of a millionaire.
In town a bijou-palace, and
Six country seats, all castellated,
A yacht or two, a four-in-hand,
A cuisine justly celebrated ;—
■With these for solace I could find
Courage enough to be resigned.
I freely mixed with social stars,
And Noblemen would grace my table;
They had the run of my cigars,
My wines, my motors and my stable;
They were not difficult to please,
And always made me feel at ease.
But now I recognise the view,
To which the poets give expression
(Speaking as men belonging to
A sadly underpaid profession),
That there are joys too deep, or high,
For even billionaires to buy.
I quite admit the power of wealth
At any ordinary juncture;
But when you sigh for youth or health,
Or for a conscience free from punc-
ture,
Not all the mines on Afric's map
Would serve to fill the aching gap*
With these elusive joys to seek,
Pray how, I ask, would it console us,
Though we were offered, so to speak,
The private right to tap Pactolus?
The gifts of Nature, as of Art,
Are seldom quoted on the mart.
The other day I bought a moor,
And on its summit I erected
A massive structure where a score
Of sporting Peers might be collected;
I know its size unnerved the grouse,
It was so like the Mansion House.
And then I purchased, as became
A lord of fifty thousand acres,
Along with tools for killing game
(By all the most expensive makers),
Some dozen suits of Harris tweed,
And twenty setters, guaranteed.
Now see how little wealth can do!
Despite the most superb of shootings,
Despite my weapons brave and new,
Despite the smartest Highland suit-
ings,
As yet (I know it sounds absurd)
I haven't hit a single bird '.

When publishers bombard one every day with some suggestion,
However much one needs it, rest is quite beyond the question.

Besides, my students have their notes verbatim, which, I hear,
Are treasured up and handed down by them from year to year.

For six months' rest. If possible, remain incognito?"

PEOPLE WHO PALL ON ME.
VI.—The Friend Who Knows of an "Ideal Holiday Spot."
I object to ideal holiday spots—at any rate, to those so
designated by friends. I don't care to be told where I ought
to go, any more than I like being told what I ought to read.
But some persons carry about the categorical imperative with
them as if it were a kind of walking-stick or umbrella.
One man tells me of a charming little place in Blankshire
"away from everything, you know—quite idyllic."
Well, I know something of those charming, idyllic little
places, and I do not desire their further acquaintance.
Besides, why on earth shouldn't I find out idyllic spots for
myself? Have I not as much imagination and enterprise as my
friends? Or, even if I haven't (an absurdly unlikely hypothesis,
but assumed), is it tactful of them to thrust the fact under my
nose?
No; I must decline to accept the stale, second-hand idylls
of my friends. Fancy going with a man and having this as a
running commentary if you showed the smallest sign of enjoying
yourself: "Didn't I tell you! Fancy a man like you never
having found out . .. . now you will know what a holiday can
be, eh?" Yes, I probably should.
Why, therefore, should I bother myself with these prescribed
ideal holiday spots? Some will run them like a patent medicine
in the near future, and we shall see monster advertisements
something like this:—
"Try Borkman's Ideal Holiday Retreat. Five hundred miles
from everywhere. Invaluable for all nervous people. Will
induce melancholia in two days. Complete imbecility guaranteed
in a week!" Or this:—" Try Razzleton'S Ideal Holiday Spot.
A perfect round of amusements from morning to night. Margate
is a fool to it. Niggers will collect under your sitting-room
window every evening. Music hall.songs of-ten years' vintage
alone on tap. Are you free from .headache? Then go to
Razzleton'S Ideal Holiday Spot. .Nervous wrecks .turned out
at the end of each holiday with the .greatest regularity," and
so on.
Now why have any plans for a holiday? Isn't there some-
thing degrading about piecing out your time, one day here,
and two days there? Just pack up a few indispensables and go
—out of town. Where? Well, you can decide in the cab on
your first stopping place.
After that let sweet inclination guide you, and eschew all
Ideal Holiday Spots " as recommended."
The essence of holiday-making lies in a whole-hearted aim-
less meander, and in the cultivation of mooning as one of the
fine arts. A. R.

LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. I.
Pizarro Polo Cortez Jones
Was in his youth a bag of bones,
A skinny, sallow, grubby child,
Whose sandy, touzled hair grew wild,
Who wore (to see with, I suppose)
A pair of gig-lamps on his nose.
"Knobs " he was called—his joints were
knotty—
His other playful name was " Spotty,"
Prom which, I fear, we must conclude
That he was plain, his fellows rude.
He never had a tio tied straight;
He always came to lessons late.
His shirt displeased his friends because
It should bo washed, but never was.
His exercises, verse or proso
(And how he did them goodness knows),
Were always what they should not be,
And so got marked with "pessime."
He did not know, and could not tell,
Who were the Kings of Israel,
And always showed he had imbued a
Pronounced distaste for those of Judah,
Refusing, though the cane impended,
To start their list or even end it.
In sober truth you could not want
To meet a boy moro ignorant.
Kindness to boys like that? Oh, stow it!
You must be firm with them and show it.
The place below his ragged jacket
Simply invited one to whack it.
His oars projecting seemed to say,

"I do not flog," his master said,
"To occupy my leisure.
Pizarro, if I smack your head
It does not give me pleasure.
Flogging and smacking are to me
No things of joy or beauty:
I do them sadly, not with glee,
And from a sense of duty."
Pizarro deemed it idle chatter;
To him it didn't seem to matter.
"A whack's a whack, howe'er you strike
it,"
He said, and didn't seem to like it,

A hardened, sullen disposition,

THE GAME OF FAMILY TYPES.
(A Sure Cure /or Insomnia.)
I, Percival Parkins, am confined to my
bed by a severe attack, a disorder in
consequence of which I am denied, in
a darkened room, the pleasures of read-
ing, writing, smoking, drinking (save
milk and soda), and eating (save soft
biscuits and rice pudding). I am pro-
vided with a delightful amanuensis, who
also reads the newspaper. Till now I
never discovered how exactly the war
telegrams were alike to each other. Left
to my own mental resources, I have hit
upon a pastime which is quite original
and thoroughly engrossing. I have called
it "Family Types." It is a very simple
game to play. You select, in the first
place, a family circle with which you
were intimately acquainted some three
decades back. I choose, therefore, the
family of Bronnson.
There were Mr. and Mrs. Bronnson and
seven children, three boys and four girls.
Now the game begins. I have to deter-
mine correctly all the attributes of
the Bronnson family. Mr. Bronnson is
easily got rid of. He was a banker and
his Christian name Thompson. Mrs. B.
was the third, no the fourth, daughter of
Lord Clinkertown; her Christian name
was—now what on earth was her Christian
name 1 This is the first check. I can't for
the life of me remember it, and so score
one mark against myself.
I now come to the children. The eldest
lad was Richard. He went into the 16th
Lancers, no, now I come to think of it,
must have been the 21st Hussars, who
nowadays have become Lancers. Very
provoking I can't remember the right
regiment! However, I'II on to Robert
the second son; he I know was in the
Navy, and was drowned in the Red Sea.
Stop, was it the Red or the Yellow or the
White Sea? Anyway, he was drowned.
William was number three, he went out to
the Cape—I am sure it was the Cape, and
some demon keeps whispering Texas.
[Here Mr. Parktns abruptly broke off, and
five minutes after was snoring loudly.

TO A FAMILY PORTRAIT ALBUM.
Volumb strange and rather weird,
By my ancestors revered,
Pray accept my greetings.
Well I know your form so fat,
Much in requisition at
Small and social meetings.
For, when other topics pall
And 'tis settled, once for all,
If it's cold or warm out;
When the conversation flags,
Then some daring mortal drags
Your familiar form out.
Sacred are your pages old,
Woe to him whose linger bold
Very slightly stains them.
On my knee I take one end
While some well-intentioned friend
Carefully explains them.
Here we see a countless host—
Friends, relations—all in most
Foolish looking poses.
Backs to artificial skies,
Touched up underneath the eyes
And along the noses.
Time-worn tales your leaves provoke
From the quiet elder folk—
Oft some aged tongue stirs—
When they see, with sudden start,
On a cabinet or carte,
What they were as youngsters.
Though I love you none too well,
Yet I have, the truth to tell.
Frequent cause to bless you.
Much your presence would be missed;
Can the family exist
That does not possess you? P. G.
LEAVES FROM A DETECTIVE'S NOTE-
BOOK.
The Strange Disappearance of Pil-
bury's Grandmother.
Thursday, Five o'clock. — Most extra-
ordinary case ever dealt with. Telegram
from Pilbury:—" Come at once; grand-
mother absolutely disappeared." Hastily
put up bag. Include all books dealing
with disappearing grandmothers. Also
pocket vol., Language of Vegetables. Catch
night express to Slogton.
Note.—Distance fifty miles. Five hours'
journey. If only our ancestors could see
the rate we travel nowadays.
PiLBURY meets me at station. Intensely
cut up. Strange look in his eye. Very
sprucely got up. Patent boots.
Query.—Is it customary to go arrayed in
patent boots on disappearance of grand-
mother?
Footnote.—Pilbury's patents. (Possible
clue.)
Significant Points of Pilbury's State-
ment.
Dwells in detached cottage on outskirts
of Slogton. Household consists of Pil-
Bl'RY', grandmother (before she dis-
appeared), and superior housekeeper,
Mrs. Burcher. Mrs. B. distinctly good-
looking. Observed same to PiLBURY', who
supposed she was.
Note.—Suspect Pilbury. Suspect Mrs.
B. Would suspect grandmother if I knew
w*here she was. Grandmother went for
walk Tuesday, 12.30. Now Friday morn-
ing and no trace of her. Simply dis-
appeared into space. Woman of sixty-
four years. Stoutish. Regular habits.
Note.—Has never disappeared before.
Pity. Always so much easier to have
precedent. Country scoured. Nobody
seen her. Everybody completely mysti-
fied. Self included.
Pilbury's Theory.—None.
Mrs. Burclter's Tlieory.—None.
My Tlieory.—None.
Assure myself grandmother did not go
north, south, or east.
Note.—Gone west? (Possible clue.)
Follow it up in afternoon. Discover
footprints edge of lake.
Query— Pilbury's grandmother?
Measure breadth of lake, 300 yards.
Enquire of Pilbury how far his grand-
mother could swim. Not 100 feet. Good.
She could not have crossed the lake.
Pilbury ventures to think if she had
swum lake, clothes would have been at
hand. Ask him has he never heard of
native dodge of carrying clothes on head?
Has not. Opines that elderly, church-
going lady would hardly divest herself
of . Confess I think it unlikely.
But explain it is the unexpected that
always happens — to those who don't
expect it. Seems convinced. Asks me if
I have any faith in the theory. Smile.
Note.—Usual practice when completely
stumped.
My Statement.—If your grandmother
could only swim 100 feet, she must have
drowned before reaching opposite bank.
Suggest dragging lake. Pilbury demurs.
Cost. Insist. Lake dragged accordingly.
.Result.—Two cwt. miscellaneous debris.
No grandmother. (Theory abandoned.)
Saturday morning. — Pilbury losing
confidence in me. Must suggest some-
thing.
Query.—What?
Visit lake again. Examine footprints.
Ask Pilbury why they suddenly cease f
Doesn't know. More do I. Don't tell
him so ; but suggost grandmother carried
off in a balloon. Pilbury' thinks it most
unlikely. Lady of advanced age suddenly
go ballooning? Reply, " not voluntarily,"
and smile.
Note.—Think it best to keep on smiling.
Asks me if I think she has been
forced. Confess no great faith in theory.
Still, anchor dangling from car. Catch
in plaquet-hole. {Theory abandoned.)
Afternoon.—Pilbury doubts my capacity.
Must do something. Search back of house.
Discover grandmother's broken specs, in
dust-hole. Completely mystified. Show
to PiLBURY' with smile. Amazed.
Important Note.—Mrs. BURCHER knew
they were there. Quite useless. (Possible
clue.)
Monday.—Search front of house. Find
hairpin of disappeared. More and more
fogged. Show to Pilbury (with smile).
Tuesday.—Seareh sides of house. Come
across tattered cap-strings. PILBURY
wants to know whether I am going to
restore grandmother in fragments. Why
can't I make a practical job of it and
restore her in bulk? At present rate
of progress says he can't hope to see her
in the entirety before Christmas.
At Lunch.— Pilbury sulky. Doesn't
believe I am a bit wiser than when I first
arrived.
Mrs. B. waiting table. Note.—Certainly
a handsome woman.
She brings potatoes. Note. — Three
waxy, two over-boiled, black eyes, one
deliciously floury. Waits till PiLBURY
has helped himself, then hands potatoes.
Floury one towards him. He takes it.
(Clue). Note.—Three reasons why in the
ordinary course of events I should have
had the best potato. (1) a handsomer
man than P; (2) a guest; (3) subtler
taste. Action of Mrs. B. sinister. Con-
sult Language of Vegetables. Read:
Handing of floury potatoes to gentleman
means " I want to marry you!" (Clue.)
Recall Pilbury's spruce appearance
and decide he is in love. No agitating
symptoms. Reciprocated. Query.—Why
should Mrs. Burcher love Pilbury?
Ans.—He will inherit £500 a year from his
grandmother. Note.—As long as she is
alive Mrs. B. luis no prospect of marrying
PiLBURY. (Phew! Wipe perspiration
from brow and continue.) Mrs. Burcher
has made away with Piibury's grand-
mother. Awful discovery! Pilbury'
notices my agitation. Asks cause. Reply
"hot on scent"—and fix Mrs. B. with
eye. Note.—Rather pleasant job. Dis-
tinctly handsome woman. But mercenary.
Tentatively ask if I may visit cellar.
Mrs. B. hurriedly says, "door locked:
key lost." impoi-tnitt Note.—Has reasons
for keeping me from cellar. Put it to
Pilbury quietly whether it isn't probable
that his grandmother, for sinister purpose,
is in wine cellar?
Replies most improbable, as grand-
mother is staunch teetotaler. ' Note.—
Pilbury's train of reasoning absolutely
idiotic. Important if true. Mrs. Burcher
states positively key of cellar in grand-
mother's pocket. Very puzzling. This
ready evasion characteristic of criminal
at bay. Her guilt apparent. Determine
to denounce her. Call her to dining-room
with Pilbury' and boldly accuse her of
being directly concerned in disappearance
of grandmother. PiLBURY'amazed. Mrs.
B., hardened in crime, denies all know-
ledge. Explain all evasion useless. Possess

THE CURSE OF THE CUSTOMER.
(How tlie Beer Bill would have acted—a
Recollection of the Session.)
"Mind, the beer must be partly malt—
no pure malt for me."
The innkeeper listened with amazement.
In his part of the country the weaker
liquid was preferred.
"You are quite sure, Sir?" he asked
his guest. "You know the doctors say
that pure malt is"
"I will not have pure malt," inter-
rupted the guest, in a tone that brooked
no further contradiction. "Give me partly
malt or I leave your hostelry for ever."
The innkeeper trembled. Times were
hard, and to lose a customer might spell
disaster.
"As you will, Sir," said he. "I will get
you the required refreshment."
While he was away the arbitrary visitor
lighted his pipe and waited impatiently
for the promised liquor. When it came
he looked at the bottle.
"Yes," he murmured, "it seems all
right. 'Partly malt' is certainly dis-
tinctly visible."
With a trembling hand the innkeeper
poured out a glass of beer. The guest
drank it, and asked for more; at the end
of the second glass he repeated his appli-
cation.
"Sirrah!" thundered the drinker, when
ho had completed the bottle, "you have
betrayed me. This is not partly malt
beer! This is beer composed entirely of
malt."
The innkeeper silently pointed to the
label.
"A cheat, a fraud! You have de-
ceived me!"
"What is your proof? How do you
know that this is not partly malt beer?"
Then came the crushing and convincing
rejoinder.
"Because, if it had been partly malt
I should by this time have been drunk,
and, look at me, I am quite sober."
HISTORY AND MYTH.
[" The famous tale of Alfbed's burning the
cakes . . . seemed to belong to a genuine tradi-
tion. There were other stories of legendary type,
such as that in which A m eld was said to hare
visited the Danish camp disguised as a harper."—
Sir Frederick Pollock to the Extension Student! at
Oxford.]
Great King, to you our thoughts we throw
Back for a thousand years or so,
Till legend we are lost in;
Of you still England owns the fame,
Her poets, too, have borne your name—
BONN, Tknnyson, and Austin!
Since Science bold, that none may shun,
Our ancient legends, one by one,
Compels us to abandon,
Even your well-loved stories she,
With wanton incredulity,
Now lays her ruthless hand on.
Your period now prim students scan,
And straightway they pronounce it an
Unprincipled invention
To say that you, when schools were few,
Were the progenitor of U-
niversity extension.
And children's faith is now upset;
We bid them carefully forget
The lessons once we told them:
How with your harp's melodious strains,
Instead of buying off the Danes,
As minstrel boy you sold them.
Yet, while the rest are overthrown,
The "story of the cakes " alone
Grim Science has respected.
Till, by a curious irony,
Your claim to future fame must be
The task which you neglected.

HINTS TO BEGINNERS. GROUSE DRIVING.
Birds coming straight towards you sometimes offer a very unsatisfactory shot.
THE NEW MOSQUITO CURE.
An American lady, who is a Christian
Scientist, is quoted in the St. James's
Gazette as saying that "it is outrageous
to kill the little harmless insects. If a
mosquito is troubling you, just speak to
him kindly and say, 'Look here, my
friend, you leave me alone and I '11 leave
you alone.' Then believe he won't bite
you. Even if he does, his sting -won't
hurt. I have dono this for years, and
now enjoy having the pretty little things
around and listening to their musical
buzz." Whence it appears that the able-
bodied " skeeter" is amenable to reason
after all, if you only address "him"
politely, and not in the customary way.
All you have to do is to catch his ear
(metaphorically), and hail him as "my
friend" in the American language. He
will then submit the question of dinner
to arbitration, or enter upon a very
offensive and defensive alliance with
you against some third party who may
happen to hold "outrageous" views as
to the sanctity of his own and the mos-
quito's person. There are some who hold
that the "musical buzz" of the "little
harmless insect" is even more demoralis-
ing in the night-watches than his bite;
but, believing that you are immune, you
will be merely lulled to sleep. In the
morning, you will wake up with your
forehead, and features generally, raised
in high relief, and any further relief will
thus be rendered unnecessary.
We wonder if this principle of parley
can bo extended to the case of other
"harmless" but too familiar insects.
Some, we fear, will refuse to be charmed
by the voice of transatlantic logic, and
will continue deaf to the tenets of the
Hague Convention. Will any one sacrifice
himself to the cause during the holidays,
and practise caressing a wasp or smooth
the ruffled feelings of a hornet? Will a
word in season and a soft answer, with or
without a white flag, avail us in our next
encounter with a mad bull, a rabid dog,
or an elephant that has turned "Turk "?
What "kind" conversational gambit
should we adopt with a poor little scorpion
that may have ensconced itself in the
boot we are putting on, or with the pretty,
playful crab that nips our big toe as we
are bathing? Will the American lady
please oblige with the correct formula
to employ on these respective occasions?
Or, can it be that such very decided
opinions have rendered her integument
so tough that no mosquito is able to pierce
it, whereas less strong-minded individuals
like ourselves are still condemned to
suffer unlimited puncture? A. A. S.
A LITTLE LATE.
I DON'T know what I wrote to you
Since you assert I was untrue,
And made an old indictment new
(But surely I was teasing ?).
It always seems so strange to me
That "give and take'' should never be
A pastime gay, a fancy free,
A sport of petty pleasing.
You know I only talked of Jack,
Because you spoke of Jill—alack!
The reel, indeed, is running back
When you recall this folly.
What can I say this Summer-tide
Except recall the world is wide ?—
I send the photo of my bride,
She is so nice and jolly,
More mistletoe than holly.
So sends a kiss—won't be denied,
1 really wish that you were tied.
Here's news for melancholy,
Her name is also Dolly!

fillips to the game.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from the Diary op Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, August 12.
—'' Whenever you see an Irish Member
on his legs talking with much fluency and
excessive bitterness on a topic not directly
relating to Ireland, cherche JOE."
This pearl of wisdom fell from lips of
Member for Sark when, entering House
just now, he found Mr. DALY on his legs
(he's that Nightly) discoursing on Pacific
Cable Bill. Evidently knew nothing about
it. That no reason why he should not
talk upon it at length. Did so. Presently
the head of Don JosiS appeared in his
Memorial, just as that of Charles the
First was wont to do in another. The
enterprise is, Mr. Daly declares, devised
for sole purpose of gratifying vanity of
Don" lost and extending his "shoddy
Imperialism." Later, John Dillon, not
having delivered speech for two hours,
prepared to average matters. Talked for
half an hour; remarks chiefly directed at
happily absent Don Jose. Might have
gone on for two hours. Himself ready
and willing; only one reason why ho
shouldn't. This was the closure, abhorred
shears that cut the thin-spun thread of
John's verbosity.
At least had consolation of knowing that
he had enjoyed earlier opportunity. Was
up at five o'clock on Royal Titles Bill.
This being undoubtedly the work of Don
Jose, was inevitably iniquitous. JOHN
Dillon discovered in it a fresh crime
against Ireland: "stamps upon her the
bar sinister." This sounds well; meaning
a little obscure. Saunderson protests he
really doesn't know what JOHN means.
What of that? An hour has been wasted
and Don Jos£ beaten afresh about his
unoffending head.
Business done. — In Committee on
Factory and Workshops Bill, Government
defeated by 163 votes against 141. "It's
of no consequence," said Mr. Toots
Ritchie, echoing the remark of his proto-
type when he inadvertently sat down
on Florence Dombey's Sunday bonnet.
"Resign! resign!" shouted the Opposi-
tion. Tim Healy, always ready to oblige,
moved the adjournment in order to give
His Majesty's Government opportunity
of considering what course they should
take in the sudden crisis.
"Not the slightest consequence," in-
sisted the Right Hon. Mr. Toots on the
Treasury Bench. "The House has deci-
sively intimated its opinion on the subject.
Resigned unto its heavenly will, the
Government carry on their business still."
Tuesday night.—Have always felt that
to know the House of Commons is a liberal
education. It is the most perfect realisa-
tion of microcosm. The men composing
it, of varied station and diverse ex-
perience, know something of everything.
A little incident that befell to-night
illustrates the point. John Burns dis-
cussing Laundry Clause of Factories and
Workshops Act. In proof of t he necessity
of supervision of so-called charitable
institutions, he cited the case of a
pseudo-religious adventurer in Essex
who organised a Home for Children and
starved them in it.
"I hope," said John, "th.it that man
is now climbing up the golden stairs of
the treadmill."
The Committee manifesting interest in
this way of looking at the exercise,
reminiscent, save in the matter of level, of
going round and round the division lobbies,
John became confidential. He knew all
about the treadmill; had trodden its
endless steps when he sojourned in
Pentonville.
"If I may give hon. Members a tip," he
said, lowering his voice to confidential
note, "I would advise them always to
take the stairs by the wall side."
The Committee laughed. Seated immedi-
ately behind Treasury Bench, JOHN G. Tal-
bot, constitutionally free from that in-
firmity, regarded the back of Ritchie's
head with fresh interest. Felt it borne
in upon him that if the Home Secretary
went on in the way he was now treading,
he, J. G. T., would some day, on his round
of duty as a visiting magistrate, catch a
back view of the right hon. gentleman
curiously foreshortened, apparently walk-
ing upstairs and never getting any nearer
the top.
All about this laundry business. Irish
Members object to certain laundries
under conventual direction being subject
to visits of inspection. Talbot doesn't
know more about laundries than the
ordinary head of a household; but hero
ho catches glimpse of the skirt of the
Scarlet Woman.
"This will be known in history as the
Great Surrender," he sobbed, tears
ploughing the lonely furrows of his cheek
just as if they were ex-Premiers retired
from business.
A little cheered by the peep into
Ritchie's future personal history sug-
gested by John Bcrns's tip. Never-
theless, sad at heart to find himself

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
dragged at the heels of the Irish Nation-
alists* because the masters of a mighty
majority shrank from the fight.
Business done.—Government capitulate
on Laundry Clause of Factories and
Workshops Bill.
Friday.—Koyal Assent given to Royal
Titles Bill. Nobody likes the title which,
Jaute de mieux, the Government have
adopted. "Edward the Seventh, by the
Grace of God of Great Britain and Ireland
and of all the British Dominions beyond
the seas, King, Defender of the Faith,
Emperor of India." Happily the title is
not cited within the four corners of Act.
It is left to tho Kino to determine the
style. This being so, I presume to call
His Majesty's attention to a precedent
that, through the long controversy, has
escaped attention. In the Anglo Saxon
Chronicle there is recorded a marvellous
vision that came to King Alfred.
"The King lay awake and thought of
all that had come to pass by day, and
presently he saw a great light, like the
brightness of the sun, and he saw an old
man with black hair, clothed in priest's
garments, and with a mitre on his head,
and holding in his right hand a book of the
Gospels, adorned with gold and gems."
This was ST. Cuthbert, who comforted
and encouraged Alfred on the eve of the
battle that delivered Wessex from the
dominion of the Dane. Cuthbert hails
the Saxon royal soldier as "King of all
Britain." What better, more precise,
yet equally comprehensive title could be
adopted by the twentieth century King,
descended in unbroken line from Alfred?
The title would then run, "Edward the
Seventh, by the Grace of God King of all
Britain and Ireland, Defender of tho Faith,
Emperor of India."
Objection was taken to Lord Rosebery'S
suggestion to substitute "King of
Britains beyond the seas," on the ground,
amongst others, that the Canadians and
inhabitants of Mauritius are not Britons.
That does not apply to adoption of King
Alfred's magnificently simple title, since
Canada and Mauritius are, for imperial
purposes, as much parts of Britain as
are Australasia or Cape Colony.

gation.

RIVERSIDE SUNDAY.
Unnumbered are the trees that fling
O'er Pangbourne Reach their shade,
Unnumbered there the birds that sing
Melodious serenade;
But as the leaves upon the boughs
Or feathers on the birds,
So are the trippers who carouse
Along the banks in herds.
Punt, centre-board, launch, skiff, canoe,
Lunch-laden hither hie,
Each bearing her expectant crew
To veal and chicken-pie;
And from the woods around Hart's Lock
Reports ring loud and clear,
■ As trippers draw the festive hock
Or democratic beer.
From one to three, below, above,
Is heard the crisp, clear crunch
Of salad, as gay Damons love
To linger over lunch.
From three to six a kettle sings
'Neath every sheltering tree
As afternoon to Phyllis brings
The magic hour of tea.
Well may the Cockney fly the Strand
For this remoter nest,
Where buses cease from rumbling and
The motors are at rest.
But would you shun your fellows—if
To quiet you incline—
Oh, rather scull your shilling skiff
Upon the Serpentine.
THE JOKE THAT CAME OFF.
It was a splendid joke: quite the
funnies't thing that he had ever lighted
on. Now a really good joke is not to be
found every day, so Simpson must not be
blamed for making a great deal of to-do
about this joke.
We were anxious, of course, to hear
the joke, and suggested to Simpson that
he should organise a select little supper-
party and then acquaint us with the
humorous masterpiece. We assured him
that we were prepared to laugh and
applaud ad lib., provided that on his side
he should see the supper was a credit to
the clief at the Savoy.
But Simpson was not impressed, and
declined to part with his joke. This was
decidedly mean and unworthy of an
Englishman.
What Englishman worth his salt ever
neglected to tell his friends "the funniest
thing in the world"? Was it not done
always as a matter of course without the
least pressure being applied? Nay, was it
not done even after friends had omitted
to show any wish to hear of the " funniest
thing"?
And we had entreated Simpson—in vain.
Oh, it was preposterous! Simpson locked
up this joke in his brain, so he told us,
and intended keeping the poor thing
there till a fitting season.
Nor was he to be moved from his
purpose by humanitarian protests on our
part. We impressed upon him that the
joke would die for want of room, but he
laughed scornfully, and said we were
jealous.
And then a celebrated wit joined us all
at the Club one day, till Simpson, goaded
beyond endurance at the rapturous way
in which we received the mildest mots,
cleared his throat and prepared to unlock
his imprisoned joke. But at the critical
moment the joke wouldn't come. The
lock must have turned rusty, or else the
joke had perished—melted away, perhaps,
with the extreme heat.
It was a ghastly moment for SIMPSON:
a moment before he had looked so confi-
dent, and then came his look of horror—his
gasp—his white and red complexion. We
all screamed with laughter. No joke
could have been as funny as was Simp-
son's face.
The celebrated wit soon left us, but he
had not been gone for a quarter of an
hour before Simpson rose to his feet
excitedly.
"I remember it," he said. Then with
a cry of relief he dashed after the cele-
brated wit.
Unhappily, the wit had just caught the
boatrtrain and was speeding away to
Paris.
Simpson, not to be daunted, pursued
him. He arrived in Paris and rushed to
his rooms. But, alas, he had just left
again for Switzerland.
Then began a frantic pursuit. Whether
the wit knew that a joke was tracking
him down none can tell, but anyway, he
eluded the Sherlock - like sagacity of
Simpson for a long while. And then, one
day, the man with a joke hunted him
down—or rather up—on the high Alps.
Simpson was divided from the celebrated
wit by a yawning abyss, but undeterred
by this he screamed across the snowy
gulf—the joke.
The celebrated wit caught the full
import of the joke, and his laughter
rolled round the mountain sides.
"Funny, isn't it?" shouted Simpson.
"Simply killing!" yelled the wit;
then fell, still laughing, into the abyss.
The mountain itself was so tickled by
the joke that it broke into appreciative
avalanches. Upon one of these Simpson,
chuckling with triumph, was carried to
join the celebrated wit.
And so the joke came off after all
among the high Alps.
It is regrettable that Simpson came off
as wel 1; but the moral is so obvious that we
ought not to lament his death. He died
nobly in the cause of humour, and as none
but the celebrated wit heard the joke, we
can all believe that this joke was the fun-
niest and most delightfully humorous sally
ever perpetrated by man. "Such tricks
hath strong imagination." A. R.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SORROWS OF PATERFAMILIAS AT THE SEASIDE.
Part III.
Early next morning dear Marion told me she had just seen
Mary Jane, our Nurse, walking -with a soldier. Replied
reassuringly, "Yes, my dear, well, why not? I am sure we
all owe a debt of gratitude to our noble"
"Oh, don't be so foolish, George!" breaks in Marion,
despairingly. "You know what soldiers are."
"Certainly, my dear. There is surely nothing mysterious
that I am aware of in their composition."
Marion looks baffled and then says, in cutting tones, "Some
men are such fools." Agree with this in abstract, but refuse
to see any personal application in remark.
After bathing with the children, sat on beach, trying to read
paper. Should have succeeded, but for being importuned by
itinerant vendors to buy flowers, cakes, fruit, toffee and
brandyballs ; and also by divers others to have my photograph
taken, patronize four piano organs and a German band, and
witness the performance of an Italian with a monkey. Hid
behind rock, some distance from crowd. Peace at last! I
threw myself at full length upon the beach, spread out my
paper and—"Want a boat, Sir? Nice day for a sail." Replied
distantly that there was no wind. Thought I rather scored
there, but the man was shameless. "Well, no,-there ain't, Sir,
not in a way o' speakin', as you might say, but it'd be a rare
day for goin' out to the Ledge, a-flshin'."
Rather good idea, this—sounded reposeful to lie at anchor
and fish.
"How much?" I asked.
"'Arf-a-crown a hour, Sir, includin' everythink, bait, lines
and all."
"I will go," I said. "At 2.30 this afternoon.
Gave up attempt to read paper, and strolled home. Dear
Marion suggested I should take Algernon and Willy. Felt
rather damped at this, as I had secretly hugged myself with
idea of quiet afternoon, free from the dear children. It ended,
of course, in taking them.
Ancient Mariner not ready when we arrived on beach. Had
not enough bait. When bait brought down by small boy, A. M.
further discovered supply of lines insufficient. Just as we
were ready to shove off, A. M. said he must run up the beach
"to see a man." Watched carefully, and distinctly saw A. M.
emerge from the "Pilot and Periwinkle," wiping mouth with
ba^k of hand.
At length we got away, and A. M. pulled us out towards the
Ledge. He rowed without any undue haste, this man. Talking
seemed more in his line than pulling. He "minded" of the
time when he had been mate of the Sudden Jerk, and a
gale had carried away her main top-gallant spritsail hal-
liards, and he alone had been saved by floating ashore on a
hen-coop. He was also in one of England's famous sea battles,
of which I happened to recollect the date. A casual enquiry
as to Mariner's age elicited that he must have either played
this gallant part at the somewhat early age of three, or
else that he was a stately liar. Personally I inclined to latter
opinion, but boys listened open-mouthed in admiring wonder-
ment.
At length we reached Ledge, and A. M. dropped anchor and
got out and baited lines with singularly revolting lob-worms.
Commenced fishing: Willy's success immediate, as he quickly
hauled out small dog-fish. A. M. breaks its neek and throws
it back into water. Willy dissolves into silent tears at loss
of his prize. Encourage him with threepenny-piece. A. M.
catches bigger dog-fish, and repeats process. I feel tug, haul
up rapidly and land battered sou'-wester. A. M. regards it
critically, and then says, "Ah, some pore chap 'as gorn over-
board 'ere, you may depend on't. Well, there's sure to be
fish, any'ow where 'e is."
Feel myself turning shade paler: inference so obvious:
recover, however, on reflecting that A. M. probably lying.
More dog-flsh reward us. At last, however, Willy hooks
whiting pout, longer than my forefinger. Another and yet
another come to hand: then two sea-perch, and a small dab.
After an hour of this, I noticed that ALGERNON had ceased talk-
ing, whilst I myself felt that, though the sea was calm, there
was more ground swell than one liked. We went on fishing for
half-hour longer, when, without warning, Aloy let his line slip
overboard, and gently collapsed into bottom of boat. 1 at-
tempted to rally him, but felt within the thrall of a gloomy
reserve, and disinclined for speech. At last, after languidly
catching two more whiting, I raised my heavy eyes to
Ancient Mariner's, and murmured the one word "Home."
With diabolical tardiness, A. M. set about getting up our
anchor; this accomplished, he deliberately loaded and lit his
evil-smelling pipe. Willy alone remained firm; and with
the unthinking levity of youth, gave imitations of our suffer-
ings. Was too feeble to even chide him, but never came nearer
disliking my own flesh and blood than at that moment. Rest
of row to the shore full of a weird calm.
Never heard any sound so grateful as that made by boat's
keel when it grated on beach.
ALGY and I stumbled weakly out, whilst A. M. hauled boat
up, and WILLY' collected our catch. We had been out nearly
two hours, and I silently tendered five shillings to A. M.
A. M. looked dubiously at money and observed:
"Wot'sthis?"
"Is it not right?" I asked. The ground I stood on seemed
to wave and rock beneath me, and I was indisposed for argu-
ment.
"We was jest hover two hours and 'n'arf," he^replied
indignantly.
"Then you charge for not being ready with the bait, and
for going to the ' Pilot and Periwinkle' 1 " I replied severely.
"Well, s'elp me, I thought you was a gentleman, I did!
Wantin' to knock orf a minute or two from a pore man's tint*.
Give us the two 'arf crowns then. Pretty afternoon's work
this 'as bin for me, I don't think."
We got back for tea, bearing our fish with us. Great rejoic-
ings on part of younger offspring at prospect of eating spoil.
"I do wish I'd been with you!" exclaimed JOHNNY,
earnestly. Algernon and I exchanged a fleeting glance, but
said nothing. Willy burst into rude guffaw, and Algernon
(dear Marion not being present) promptly smacked his head.
Felt it my duty to frown, though secretly delighted to see
Willy's unfeeling conduct so suitably rewarded.
The whiting were duly fried for supper. With gruesome
memories of A. M.'s suggestion anent the sou'-wester, I
declined to partake of the fish; and when, later on, dear
Marion remarked that whiting was a fish with a lot of "body"
in it, I left the table and strolled into the garden for air.
Marion supposed we should "soon be going out fishing again";
but I looked at Algernon, who smiled in a far-off way, and
thought not .
I was exhorted by Marion, next day, to take the dear chil-
dren out for donkey-ride on sands. Five of them accompanied
me, and waited whilst I bargained with extortionate donkey
men. Arranged terms and then found that children expected
me to also ride donkey. Tried to escape, but in vain. Had to
mount long-eared steed, and submit to its monotonous joltings.
Very undignified for City man. Consoled myself by thinking
that Pkrksley was the only person who knew me in the whole
of Cockleton, and he, certainly, did not count. Alas, for the
futility of earthly hopes! Before we had proceeded two
hundred yards along sands, Perksley himself met us, and
(unasked) joined our party. And two minutes later we met the
wife of our vicar, Lady Chasuble, with whom dear MARION
particularly wishes to stand well. Had no idea the Chasubles
were down hero. She raised her lorgnettes languidly, and

focussed me, bestriding a small donkey, and listening, perforce,
to the loud laughter and vulgar jokes of Perksley. As she
turned away in lofty disgust—for she has openly said that
nothing will induce her to know the Perksleys—I felt my cup
of bitterness to be full indeed. A moment later, however, and
it was fuller still: for my girth broke, the saddle came round,
and I rolled ignominiously on the sand, amid a hideous din of
giggles, screeches and loud laughter, led by that arch-villain,
Perksley. On returning to house, bruised and humiliated,
Marion (rather unreasonably, as I thought) said that really
had no patience with them,

dear Marion thought I had
better go for doctor. Did so,
in costume consisting of frock-
coat buttoned over pyjamas,
and bed-room slippers. Could
not find doctor. Wasted nearly
an hour looking for his house;
then met coast guard, who
showed me the way. Rang
night-bell eleven times; then
doctor appeared in costume
lighter than my own. He
accompanied me home. On
enquiry, found that Johnny
had been feeding Baby and
himself freely on the chalky-
looking sweets. Doctor an-
noyed, and grumbled at being
"called up for nothing."
Apologised and handed him
guinea. To bed again at 4.30
a.m.
Collector called and I had
to subscribe to Town Band,
Athletic Sports Committee,
Cricket Club and Regatta
Funds. Collector said he had
been told to ask me to sit on
Regatta Committee. Felt that
I should very much like to
'.' sit on" collector. Regattas
always a nuisance. Dear
Marion insisted upon my accepting proffered honour, and 1
was thereupon told to attend meeting that night at parish
room.
Next two days, all Regatta Committee—no time for anything
else—I was to order fireworks, arrange battle of confetti at
night, engage town band, and, finally, present myself on board
committee boat, by 10.0 a.m. on the eventful day.
Eventful day disgusting, from weather point of view. Went
on committee boat and was invested with huge blue favour.
Squalls of wind alternated with pelting showers throughout.
Boatmen's sailing race interesting, as it produced three
protests, an objection to winner for having gone wrong course,
a double claim against committee, with threats of County
Court actions for stakes, and a row royal, eventuating in
a fight between two beery mariners on beach, our boat
rocking so disagreeably that I soon make excuse for being
put ashore—thankful I reached there just in time. Retreated
to our lodgings, but messenger came up directly afterwards to
say there was some dispute as to band's terms—would I just
step down and settle it? And he added that the fireworks had
not arrived from London—would I kindly wire at once? Went

down to band first. Bandmaster already very drunk and un-
pleasant. Demanded just twice sum agreed upon. Feebly tried
to temporise. Bandmaster aggressive. I looked around help-
lessly, and saw telegraph messenger approaching. Took tele-
gram and read—" Please return. Pogson ill."
POGSON is my junior parter. I jumped at the chance. Slip-
ping away from drunken bandmaster, I rushed back to Shore
Villa, flung a few things into Gladstone bag, wrote explaining
matters to dear Marion, and one to Perksley—this was my
revenge—asking him to take my place on Regatta Committee,
and settle with bandmaster. I flattered myself this last move
absolutely Machiavellian—and fled to station.
For two days in town I was
peaceful and happy. Then
came [this letter from Perk-
sley:
"Dear old Cove" [vulgar
brute!]—"I soon settled your
little dispute with old Blow-
hard. Told him you were a
generous sort of bloke, and
that as there seemed to have
been some mistake about terms,
you'd give them a fiver out of
your own pocket above what
the committee paid. That's
a bit of all right, ain't it? Met
Lady Chasuble yesterday, and
introduced myself by telling
her you and me were such
pals; more like brothers, i n
fact." [The outrageous vil-
lain !] "She didn't quite seem
to cotton to me, but we shall get
on first-rate in time. So long.
Your pal—Wm. J. Perksley.
"P.S. Your share of the de-
ficit of Regatta Committee
amounts to seven pounds four
and a penny, which please
remit to them at once."
And this was the end of it all.
It was for this I sacrificed what
might have been a pleasant
holiday.
I need scarcely say that I
have done with Cockleton. It is
a place I have no farther use for.

Drusilla, dear Drusilla,
In its velvet deeps I'd dwell,
And bear my loves before me for the Queen of Dimple Dell.
In a nest of lovely roses,
'Neath the light of laughing eyes
And a gentle spirit breathing through this tiny Paradise.
Drusilla, dear Drusilla,

I lingered and you once forgot your laughter's magic spell,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HOUSE OF REST FOR HUMAN
BEINGS. I
Dear Mr. Punch,—So much has been
written by appreciative men and women
of the Home of Rest for Horses at Acton,
a most deserving institution, that, per-
haps, a short personal experience of a
bipod at a Human House of Rest in the
Northern Highlands of London may not be
wholly unacceptable. In the first place,
let it be clearly understood that " perfect
repose" was the recipe given by the
talented physician who prescribed for the
relief of my nerves, shattered by a fear-
some and dangerous operation.
In the second, that the air of
the Northern Highlands was
recommended as peculiarly
prone to give bracing influences
by day and refreshing sleep by
night. The House of Rest
selected had much to recom-
mend it in appearance. It
stood on the slope of a toler-
ably steep hill, and the road
being barred at one end by
an entrance to the public
park, the intrusion of the
raucous costermonger, the in-
sidious "rag and bone " man,
and the peripatetic coal mer-
chant seemed as strictly
prohibited as would be betting
at the street corner. But I,
the man who needed rest, soon
found that appearances were
as deceptive as those supplied
by the proverbial chameleon.
The ground-floor of the House
of Rest was occupied by Mr.
and Mrs. Bounderby—a vigor-
ous young couple, who spent
their time in warbling comic
songs, playing at spelling bee
with their friends, and settling
domestic disputes at all hours

HOW TO REMAIN A MILLIONAIRE.
Dkar Mr. Puxcu,—As the representa-
tive of everyone, from the richest to the
poorest, I venture to address you. I see
that in one of the magazines there is
an article showing the expenses of the
wealthy. I am convinced that the estimate
is misleading because it is founded in some
respects on too liberal a scale. Now let
me consider the items of my actual
expenditure.
First comes house rent, rates and taxes.
It would bo ridiculous to imagine that this
would cost a penny less than £100 or
even £150. Of course, if one went to
Brixton, or even West Kensington, it
might bo a trifle less. But in a central
position it would be certainly that.
Now as to wines. Say you entertain
once or twice a week. Well, here again
it is safe to put down a substantial sum.
You will find £5 a year the very least.
One's friends will not drink shilling claret,
and are liable to turn up their noses at a
really effervoscing champagne at two and
twopence. Next, board and lodging for
yourself, say 10s. a day, or, in the aggregate,
£180 a year, or thereabouts. Servants'
wages quite £20 a year, and board to
match, £5. With the assistance of the
secondhand clothes provider your wearing
apparel might be kept within £4 10s.,
but it would be safer to say £5. Then, for
extras, say £1000. And there you are,
don't you see.
But stay, I have left out of my calcula-
tions the heaviest item of the lot, and the
most important •— advertisements. Say
£1200 for advertisements. It may be
asked—by the simple and inexperienced—
what are advertisements? To which I
reply, contributions to charities.
Yours truly, Crojsus, Junior.

PUNCH, OB, THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [August 28, 1901.
THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A Great Thought for Every Day in the Year.
Second Series.
VIII.—THE MRS. HUMPHRY WARD SECTION.
August 1st.—Out there on the terrace of the Villa Prighi the
last of the sunset had ceased to illumine the intellectual brow
of Hells mere Bannisty. "Modelled by Praxiteles, tinted by
BOTnOELLl"; so his head had been described by an artist.
Through the well-preserved growth that clustered round this
noble organ he ran his long nervous fingers as he pored, with
critical rapture, over the final proofs of his great opus:—Italian
Liberty: its Cause and Cure.
2nd, 3rd.—Immersed in the splendour of one of those scenic
descriptions which reflect a conscientious observation in situ—
had he not rented the Villa Prighi largely for the very uses of
local colour ?—he could still appreciate the humorous exhala-
tions that stole up from the old-world soil of the Campagna
through the sentinel lines of prophylactic eucalyptus. Yet
in a general way it was not consonant with his detached
personality to be affected by anything of a strictly humorous
character.
4th, 5th.—Nor would a nature less absorbed in its own
identity have put so severe a strain on the devotion of its
audience. But to a type like Hellsmere's it did not occur
that ROSAMOND was laying more surely every minute the
foundation of an incurable catarrh. It only seemed natural
that she should want to sit shivering in this deadly air for mere
joy of hearing the following passage for the twenty-third
time:—
6th.—" Above me, as I write, stretches the midsummer
cobalt of an Italian sky in the full sense of that expression.
Below, beneath, before, behind, to right, to left, lies the vast
sweep of the Campagna. To have seen Rome apart from the
Campagna—rich though the Eternal City undoubtedly is in
classical and ecclesiastical traditions, continuously maintained
from the era of Romulus and Rhea Silvia down to that of
Marie Corelli and Hall Caine, not excluding the Pontiffs—
is to have missed the intrinsic force of Italy's association with
her own soil.
7th, 8th.—" Here from the terrace of the Villa Prighi I look
out over avenues of ilex and stone-pine, over a wide largesse
of rose and lilac and cyclamen, and other growths whether
perennial or appropriate to the season, to where, like a phantom
balloon, rises the airy dome of Peter, and, beyond, on the faint
horizon, Soracte stands up and drinks the noontide. And
everywhere, and always, always, always, the Campagna.
Hour by hour, day by day, week by week, under varying con-
ditions of light and weather, I have remarked the view from
my terrace at Villa Prighi; and I can recall no occasion,
however apparently trivial, when the Campagna in some form
or other has not met my astonished eyes.
9th—11th.—"But when the dying splendour falls on vine-
yard and ploughland, on broom and cytisus and aromatic bean;
when waves of pellucid amethyst and purple come tumbling
out of the wild west, and throw a reflected glory on the
dazzling gleam of stucco antiques and sombre lichen-crusted
travertine; and the love-lorn nightingale prepares to grow
eloquent in cypress-bowers; then the Campagna is her truest
self; then from her ghostly soil, a teeming hot-bed of forgotten
effigies, uprise those effluvia of the shadowy past which intoxi.
cate the lizard and other native fauna, and to an impressionist,
like myself, are a most lively source of literary inspiration."
******
12th.—[Orouse shooting begins.] From the Campagna to the
moors of Balliemet; what a change of milieu / And it was
characteristic of Hellsmere that his spiritual condition always
took on something of the colour of his physical environment.
He was cognisant of a recrudescence of feeling in favour of the
strait tenets of his childhood's orthodoxy. The very air, waft-
ing warm scents of moorland, seemed heavy with Presbyterian
conviction.
13th.—Almost involuntarily he found himself reviewing the
processes, now logical, now arbitrary, by which he had arrived
at his present tolerance of the principles of Christian Science,
qualified by an obscurantist Panatheism. His early unreason-
ing acceptance of U. P. dogma; his tentative excursions in
Kant, followed by a sudden and glorious emancipation from the
school of Peebles; his reaction from the strain of the larger
Secularism under the Pagan teaching of Barbizon and La
Boheme; then, at first sight of the Eternal City, his volte-face
from the doctrines of the Latin Quarter to those of the Latin
Fathers; the yearning, out of a confused memory of Crockett,
John Stuart Mill, and the Contes Drolatiques, to find in
traditional Authority a sure euthanasia of speculative thought;
and, finally, the attraction towards the new Occidental creed
of Faith-healing, culminating in an attitude of reservation and
eclectic detachment.
16th.—Yet the chains of heredity were not to be so lightly
thrown off. He had been reminded of their force as he
swallowed his bowl of porridge at breakfast. And now, what
the Scots oatmeal had begun, the heather and the gillies and
the whining of the Gordon setters seemed likely to confirm.
For a while he almost trembled to think that he was on the eve
of an atavism. O. S.

THE GOLLY GIRL AND HER GALOOT.
(A West Country Ditty.)
[The " Golly Girl" is the maiden who works her trade of fish-selling on
the shore. The " Galoot,1' evidently a name borrowed from over the seas, is
the lover who braves the ocean wave. This explanation is necessary because
"Golly Girl" and " Galoot" have not yet been put into any English Dic-
tionary.]
In the old West port by the rolling of the sea
Part the Golly Girl and her Galoot.
It's the story of the past, of what might but couldn't be
For the Golly Girl and her Galoot.
The Golly Girl is slender, and her head is red with gold,
And her eyes are like the amethysts that violets unfold
When the dew is waxing weaker and the sun is growing bold,
So the Golly Girl to her Galoot.
O sweet Golly Girl
With red-gold curl,
Never listen to the white owl's hoot.
For the dawn will surely rise
With the splendour of your eyes
When you welcome back your own Galoot
In the old West port by the roaring of the gale
Waits the Golly Girl for her Galoot.
And her locks are very lank and her lips are very pale,
She is longing for her lost Galoot.
The Golly Girl is weary with the waiting of the years,
With the never-ended watching 'mid the storm of constant tears,
But she's clinging like a limpet to the man she knows, who
steers
To the Golly Girl—her own Galoot.
O sweet Golly Girl,
In the tempest's whirl,
Can't you see where that ship must shoot?
Between the rock and pier
He is there, but he can steer,
At the wheel is standing your Galoot.
And, glory be, she's free, he is safe as safe can bo,
And harboured is your own Galoot!

He. "That's all I'm abkino you to do, my dear. You please me well emouohI"
THE EXCUSE-MAKER.
I realised at once that I had mistaken
the number of the chambers: the middle-
aged gentleman in a frock-coat obviously
was not the manager of The Rushlight,
whom I was anxious to interview concern-
ing an honorarium somewhat overdue.
"Excuse me "—I began.
"Certainly, certainly," ho said, opening
a large note-book. "Delighted to do so
—on the usual terms. If you will give me
the details of your case ''
"You misunderstand me. Sir," I said,
considerably surprised, "I was about to
explain"
"Just what I asked you to do. I gathered
that you want an excuse, and my profes-
sion is to supply them—for strict cash."
"You are a solicitor, then ?" I asked.
"Not at all. I am an Excuse-maker.
I supply excuses to the nobility, clergy,
landed gentry, and others. If you haven't
come to consult me professionally, what
are you doing here ?''
"It was a mistake," I explained. "If
an excuse is needed"
"You have come to the right person,"
he concluded. "Those I supply are
sound, superfatted, and defy competition.
Perhaps you suffer from a tender con-
science? Precisely. Most of my clients are
victims to that ailment, but, thanks to me,
its evil consequences are entirely avoided.
My time is precious, however. May I ask
you once more to be good enough to state
what brand of excuse you need?"
"What sorts do you supply?" I asked.
"Every possible kind. Here, for
instance,"—he picked up a letter—" is a
typical case—that of a Cambridge under-
graduate who wishes to attend a dance in
town on Thursday. He has no imagination;
his own excuses—if he was foolish enough
to make them for himself—would be
contemptible. Probably he'd say that he
wanted to see a dentist, and his tutor
would laugh in his face at that ancient
fable. But he has had the sense to ask
my assistance, and on the right day he '11
get a letter saying: 'Sir, many years ago
your grandfather did me an inestimable
service. Now I am a millionaire, and as
a slight mark of gratitude, I wish to offer
your college a small benefaction of a few
hundred thousands or so. Please meet
me at the Hotel Cecil on Thursday night
to arrange details.' This letter he '11
show to his tutor, who, of course, will give
him his exeat like a shot. Then here's
another case — that of an M.P. who
promised some time back to address his
constituents next week. Unfortunately,
he 'b offended them since by some of his
votes, and he would be heckled in a very
disagreeable way if he appeared. To-
morrow, therefore, he '11 receive a letter,
signed with the name of an eminent
doctor, absolutely forbidding him to take
part in any political meeting for the next
six months, and with this he '11 bo able to
pacify his committee."
"Quito so," I remarked, "but as I
am neither an undergraduate nor an
M.P."
"Oh, but I provide excuses for every
class — those two are only samples.
Possibly you are about to stay at a country-
house of which you know very little. Per-
haps it will be dull, perhaps not. Well,
two days after your arrival you '11 have a
wire from me saying, 'Return to London
at once. Most important business. Your
presence absolutely necessary.' If you 're
having a good time, you '11 merely tear
this up. But if you 're bored, you '11 show it
to your host and leave by the next train."
"In fact," I said, rather coldly, "your
system is one of organised falsehood."
"On the contrary," he returned, " it's
the very opposite. But for my services
as an excuse maker many persons would bo
compelled to resort to falsehood—a pain-
ful thing to people with tender consciences.
They employ me, and then thero's no
necessity for them to tell untruths."
"And yet," I suggested, "there's that
old saying, 'qui s'excuse s'accuse.'"
"Precisely," ho said, triumphantly,
"precisely. The man who makes his own
excuses in so doing accuses himself of
idiocy. He's like the man who tries to
be his own doctor or solicitor. His con-
science suffers, and his home-made
excuses are crude, inartistic, unconvinc-
ing. The wise man comes to me, and I do
the business for him for a most moderate
fee. But I've got seventeen more excuses
to provide tc-day, and really cannot
waste my time in talk. Good-morning 1"

FORTHCOMING DEAMAS.
I.—The Return of Ulysses.
Mr. Stephen Phillips is writing a play in blank verse, for
Mr. Tree, on The Return of Ulysses. But-why in Blank Verse? A
prose drama on realistic lines, dealing with the hero's return after
his twenty years of absence and with his subsequent departure
(see Tennyson) would be far more in keeping with the modern
spirit. Let Mr. Phillips break away from the old-fashioned
poetic treatment of the subject (as exemplified in Homer), and
approach it frankly and fearlessly from the realistic stand-
point. He would then tarn out a play of thrilling human
interest, more or less as follows :—
Scene I.—The courtyard before the Palace of ULYSSES at Ithaca.
The house is greatly out of repair. Arods, a watch-dog,
very old and blind, dozes on the mat before the front door,
which is open. ULYSSES, in an extremely ragged suit of
armour, and with nothing on his legs, enters R and goes up
to the door. He seems annoyed at the neglected condition
of the house.
Ulysses. H'm! Don't think much of the way things have
been looked after during my absence. They '11 have the rain
through the roof if those tiles aren't seen to. But that's the
worst of being away so long. Everything goes to rack and
ruin. (Notices ARGUS on the mat.) Hullo, Argus, is that you?
You must be precious old by now. Come and speak to your
master. (Stoops down to pat him.)
Argus (without even looking at him). Urrgh!
Ulysses (stepping back hastily). I believe the idiot doesn't
recognise me. Here, Argus, good dog! (Argus does not stir.)
I wish I had a stick or something. (Si/cop/wnticallj/.) Qood
old dog then.
Argus (slowly turning his head and facing the intruder).
Urrrrrrgghh!
Ulysses (retreating hurriedly). Dash it, this is very awkward.
The old fool will bite me if I don't take care. (Advancing
cautiously.) If I could only manage to reach that bell. (Does
so, by a great effort, and pulls violently. • It does not ring.)
Broken, by Jove! (With vexation.) I do think Penelope might
have kept the front door bell in order. It's really very careless
of her. (Argus lowers his head once more upon his paws and
closes his eyes.) I believe he *s going to sleep again. I wonder
if I can step over him without his waking. (Creeps up on tiptoe
and endeavours to do so. Argus opens his eyes and snaps
viciously). Ah, would you!
Argus (rising and glaring shortsightedly at the visitor. Wow,
wow, wow, wow, WOW!
UUjsses (backing nervously). Good dog! Good doggie! I wish
to goodness I had something on my legs. Hang it, he's coming
after me. (Argus advances slowly upon him. He retreats before
him across the court-yard.) Good dog then! Nasty, vicious
brute, he '11 nip me before I know where I am. If he'd only
look the other way for a moment I might make a dash for the
door and get in before he caught me. (With a sudden inspira-
tion.) Hi, Argus! Rats! (Argus loofcs round for a moment.
ULYSSES makes a rush for the door, but the dog is too quick for
him, and grips him firmly by the leg.) Hi! Help! Let go, you
brute!
There is a short scuffle, and then a howl from Argus as
ULYSSES wrenches himself free, and gives him a kick which
lands him in the middle of the court-yard. Ulysses
rushes to the liat-stand, and searches feverishly for a
walking-stick with which to defend himself. At this
inopportune moment the inevitable Old Servant of
Greek tragedy appears.
Old Servant. Now, then, what are you doing there?
Ulysses (angrily). What am I doing? What are you doing,
you mean. Why didn't you come before? Didn't you hear me
calling? That confounded dog has bitten me, and I'm looking
for a stick to break his ribs with.
Old Servant (with great scorn). Looking for a stick, indeed!
Trying to steal the umbrellas, that's what you 're doing! Be
off with you, or I '11 call the dog again. Here, Argus, at him!
Ulysses (alarmed). Don't do that, you fool. Don't you know
me? I'm Ulysses.
Old Servant. Gracious, it's master! Whatever will mistress
say! (Runs in excitedly.)
Ulysses. Here, come back! What's come to the man, running
off like that. (ARGUS rises from the ground and limps painfully
towards the hmtse, growling in an undertone.) And here's that
dashed dog coming after me again. Confound it! 1 can't stay
here. (Bolts after aged servant as the curtain falls.)
Scene II. The dining hall and general living room of the Palace.
The table is laid for a large number of diners, but the only
occupant of the room at present is Penelope, o dear old
lady, very amiable and very deaf, who sits in a great chair by
the hearth.
Old Servant (shuffling into tile room and running all his words
together in his excitement.) The-master 's-come-back-and-he 's-in
the-hall-now-and
Penelope (peering at him over her spectacles). Eh?
Old Servant (raising his voice). The master's comeback
Penelope. I can't hear you. You must speak louder.
Old Serwnt (sliouting). The MASTER'S
Penelope. No, I didn't say you were to speak faster. I said
you were to speak louder.
Old Servant (goes up and bellows angrily in her ear). I didn't
say «' PASTER." I said "MASTER.''
Penelope. Well, well; there's nothing to be cross about.
"Paster" and "pasture" are very much alike, and you
know I'm a little hard of hearing. What's happened to the
pasture?
[Enter ULYSSES. The Old Servant, giving up all attempt to
make the old lady hear, points mutely at him.
Penelope. Ulysses! (Jumps up, toddles to him and throws
her arms round his neck). Is it really you, safe and sound?
Ulysses (grumbling). Safe enough, but I should have been
sounder if that cursed dog hadn't just taken a piece out of my
leg. Why don't you keep your front door bell in order?
Penelope. I don't hear so well as I did, dear. You must speak
a little louder.
Ulysses (raising his voice). I said that brute of a dog had
bitten me.
Penelope. Written? Of course I've written. But we haven't
known your address for some time. Even the Delphic Oracle
didn't know it, for I sent Telemachus to ask them.
Ulysses (shouting). What message did they send back?
Penelope. Not bend your back? Poor dear; you 're stiff
after your journey. Sit down by me.
Ulysses (sitting by her and roaring into her ear). I didn't say
"BEND." I said "SEND."
Peneiope (quite unruffled). Well, well, "bend" and "spend"
are very much alike. And I don't hear so well as I did.
Where's my trumpet? (Puts it to her ear.) Now I can hear
you. Tell me all your adventures. Where have you been all
this time?
Ulysses (evasively). Paying visits. I stayed some time with
Alcinous, and payed a call on the Cyclops, and put in a year
or two with Calypso, and some time with Circe.
Penefope. I thought CiRCE always turned men into pigs.
Ulysses. So she does. So would you, my dear, if you cooked
as well as she does.
Penelope. How horrible!
Ulysses. On the contrary. Most agreeable. And how have
you been?
Penelope. Pretty well—if it weren't for the suitors.
Ulysses. The what?

Pat. "Shure, ybr honour, and it's just that little drop that's wantin' to varnish it!"

Ulysses. The deuce they did. That sounds rather ominous.

Penelope. About a hundred.

About a hundred! Where's my hat? I must go at once.
They '11 cut my throat if they find me here. I'm not so young

Penelope. I can't hear a word you're saying, dear.
Ulysses. Confound it! where's that trumpet? (Speaking into
it.) I "was saying, I thought I'd be off before your admirers
turned up, as they sound rather dangerous.
Penelope (beaming on him). That's right, dear. Go down to
your ship and bring up your crew, and when the suitors are all
sitting comfortably at their dinner you can rush in and butcher
them.
Ulysses (peevishly). But I haven't got a ship. It was wrecked
years ago.
Penelope. Were all the crew drowned?
Ulysses. All of them. I was the last to leave the ship.
Penelope. My brave husband I
Ulysses. Not at all. She was bottom upwards. The others
held on as long as they could.
Penelope. Then what are you going to do?
Ulysses (irritably). Do? Be off as fast as my legs can carry
me, of course. What do you suppose?
Penelope. And leave me altogether?
Ulysses. Can't help it, my love. A wife with a hundred
suitors all clamouring for her husband's blood isn't the most
comfortable person in the world to live with.
Penelope. I'm so sorry.
Ulysses (grimly). Not half so sorry as I am, my own. If you'd
travelled as much as I have during the past ten years, you'd
be pretty sick at having to leave home before you'd been in it
half an hour. What time do you expect these ruffians?
Penelope. They may be here any minute now.
Ulysses. Then there's no time to be lost. I believe I hear
footsteps already. Goodbye I My love to TELEMACHU8.
Penelope (embracing him tearfully). Oh, it's dreadful to have
to lose you directly you have got back, in this way.
Ulysses (torn between desire to comfort his wife and longing to
get away). Of course it is, dear. And I'm dreadfully sorry to
leave you. Hark 1 isn't that somebody coming? No, it's no
one. Yes, as I was saying, I'd dearly like to stay and

A HOUSE-HUNTING SONG.
Some people liunt the local fox and some tho polar bear,
And some chase after bargains with extraordinary care;
Some try to sweep celebrities within their social net,
But I go hunting houses and I haven't found one yet.
There's a close time for whatever game that sportsmen may
pursue,
And after-season remnants aren't continually on view;
While Mrs. Leo Hunter finds sometimes her quarry flee,
But from an endless house-hunt there's no holiday for me!
I want to live in Surbiton, Pall Mall, and Cheyne Walk,
The baby'd vote for Hampstead Heath if he could only talk;
His parent on the mother's side likes frequent change of air,
And varies like a weather-hen—from Richmond to Mayfair.
There always is a room too few, or else a room too much,
The neighbourhood's too low—if not, the rent's too high to
touch;
It seems as if I might as well chase Botha or De Wet,
The fact is, that I can't decide what kind of house to get!
"BUONA NOTTE."
(Or not, eh t)
North Italy is delightful in summer, and existence would be
perfect if sleep were possible. Even Dr. Watts could not have
condemned the voice of the sluggard complaining that he had
been waked too soon, if the awakening had been at five in the
morning, or earlier. Venice itself, though the traffic is noise-
less, has means of arousing one. People argue and walk, and
sometimes sing, under the windows till 2 or 3 A.M., and before
5 the neighbouring church bells are in full swing. In winter,
when one could shut the windows, one might hear less, but in
summer one does not lose a word of the discussion or a note of
the song. The afternoon siesta is some compensation, for at
that time no one talks because everyone is dozing. Sometimes
one is willing to keep awake, when, for instance, there is a
Serenata on the Grand Canal, an excellent concert in a deco-
rated barge moving slowly along, surrounded by gondolas with
gondoliers all in white, looking by moonlight like coffins rowed
by ghosts.
To return towards England avoid Milan, hotter and noisier,
and go across by Brescia and the Lakes. Arrive at Brescia
in the evening, the only time a train is supportable. Waiter
ushers me into elegant bedroom almost entirely covered with
red velvet. Appears warm. Hope it is quiet. Look out of
the window and perceive wide thoroughfare paved with cobble-
stones. There may not be much early traffic. Waiter assures
me there is no noise. Perhaps on the first floor a little, but on
the second, ah, no I Retire to rest. Suddenly awakened by
sounds as of an earthquake and a thunderstorm combined. It
is the first waggon over the cobble-stones, and the time is
4.15 a.m. Then follows a moment's peace and then another
waggon. Get up and rush out on to the staircase. Discover
sleepy porter in hall. Explain my position. He remarks that
it is nearly five, as though everyone were anxious to get up at
five. Explain that I am not, and follow sleepy porter with
candle along various passages to distant apartment of vast
size, remote from chief street. Porter points out regretfully
that there are no sheets. Excursion back to previous room,
procession along passages with armful of sheets and pillows,
and peaceful sleep for at least an hour. Then become aware
that there is a peal of bells not many yards away. Leave
Brescia without regret.
Arrive at Lecco also late in the evening. Crowd sitting out-
side hotel. Proprietor opens door of omnibus. Every room
full. "Non^c'e- una camera." There is a regatta to-morrow.
Impossible to leave Lecco as there is no train. Lengthy dis-
cussion between proprietor and his wife. Finally put me in the
large reading room, made as comfortable as possible. But feel
compelled to rise early, to make way for tho readers, if thcro
are any.
Across the Swiss frontier to Bcllinzona. Amongst the placid
Swiss may sleep more peacefully. Hotel recommended by the
infallible Baedeker. Find that it is clean and fairly well-
managed, but in the most undesirable position imaginable,
squeezed in between a high rock, four feet away, and a stone-
paved street. Far from being entre cour et jardin, an ideal
situation, it is entre rue et rocher. Not only that. The
architect has further ideas of comfort. Between the rock and
tbe^street stands the campanile of the church. Ecro! The
site is perfect. He puts his building against the tower, and
every time the clock strikes the hotel quivers. Less than a
quarter of a mile away there are open fields, and charming
views of woods and mountains. At most places with Italian
names sleep is difficult. But at Bellinzona, in the hotel
recommended by tho infallible Baedeker, himself sleepless,
ever on the watch for information, it is impossible. H. D. B.
FOLLOWING UP THE TRAIL.
(A fragment from a Sartorial Romance.)
"But surely you will be reasonable," said the Professor,
"you know that your trailing skirt may mean dea h to tens,
to hundreds, to thousands!"
The Lady without Mercy merely smiled and pointed to a
highly-coloured plate in which a female was depicted strutting
proudly across a marble terrace side by side with a peacock.
"Yes, I know many wear them," continued the Professor,
earnestly. "But you should remember the responsibilities
of your station. Did you not hear at the recent conference
that the trailing skirt carries the germs of sickness, aye, and
death, into the house and the home?"
But the Lady without Mercy continued smiling and pointing.
"Can nothing move you ?" implored the Professor. "Listen.
Like most scientists, I am a millionaire; like most scientists, I
have received a peerage for my services to the world. I lay
my cash, my rank at your feet. I ask only one concession, and
I ask it in the name of civilisation and my own self-respect.
Give up the trailing skirt and become my wife I"
For a moment the Lady without Mercy wavered, then she
smiled—this time a little sadly—pointed to the picture, and left
him.
A week passed and they met once more. To his delight she
wore the short skirt of common sense. He rushed towards her.
"Oh, my darling, you have made the concession I demanded!
Oh, my angel, you have listened to the dictates of your
conscience! My own, my soon-to-be wife!"
"Yes, Erasmus Dionysius," she responded softly, "I am
willing to share your rank and cash. And, dearest, as there
should be no secrets between the recently-engaged, let me
confess to you that I gave up my trailing skirt because I read
in the Times it was no longer fashionable."

In olden time, in Portsmouth town,
When OliORiiE the something wore the

When wars with France seemed always
near
And of invasion we'd a fear;
A gang wont round—the Press.
And men who by this gang were caught,
When blood was hot, like tigers fought;
Thus oft was England's freedom boughti
Through power of the Press.
In present time in every town
The Fourth Estate achieves renown.
Our freedom, still our proudest boast,

Of " Gentlemen—Tho Press!"

From Pekin to Witwatersrand,

Which represents tho Press.

Such was PlZARRO's life at school,
Not formed or planned on any rule,
Save this :—if at a given minute
There comes a scrape, be sure you 're in it.
If Justice chanced to want a victim,
She never paused, but promptly picked
him:
Not that his crimes were great or many—
He rarely perpetrated any—
But rather that his looks bewrayed him;
He blushed with ease, a fact that made
him,
When red beyond all recognition,
Obnoxious to extreme suspicion.
The booby-trap that spilt its water
On Dr. Ccfflad's matron's daughter;
That worthy matron's bed—oh, fie !—■
Converted to an apple-pie;
The broken pane, the tattered syntax,
The master's highlows filled with tintacks;
The dart impelled by secret force
Upon its swift and peccant course—
These crimes, and more as fine and largo,
Were always laid to Jones's charge.
Not his the deeds, but his the rueing.
To blush when charged is worse than
doing.
Well, well, the years passed on, and he
Passed his matriculation:
In ancient days it used to be
No hard examination.
His Greek and his arithmetic
He was not very pat in;
He know no French ; he used to stick
In Euclid and in Latin.
Yet ho became—the feat was great—
An Oxford undergraduate!
I shall not follow his career
From week to week, from year to year;
The task would bore you.
I can describe Pizarro'S acts
By laying certain salient facts
Coldly before you:—
He did not run, ho would not row,
His private reading was no go;
Ho knew no cricket.
He did not seem to be aware
That when a pig-skin's full of air,
You catch or kick it.
In this dead list of negatives
One positive stands out and lives:
Upon his face he wore a fur-suit—
His cheeks and chin were very hirsute.
In short, although his comrades jeered
He was a smug and grew a beard!
The years went on, and finally
Our hero took a pass degree,
Fading from Oxford life away
As P. P. Cortez Jones, B.A.
1 pass tho intervening years,
With all their hopes and joys and fears.
Let this poor fact suffice for fame,
That JONES took Orders and became,
His life progressing at a due rate,
A Church of England country curate.
Would that my humble pen were equal
To tolling all tho glorious sequel;
Would that my skill could paint the glory
Of our Pizarro'S splendid story!
Enough. I '11 take one blazing scene
To show my readers what I mean :—
That fate unkindly tests and searches
Our early lives with canes and birches;
Or takes and dooms us to perdition
With keepings-in or imposition;
Makes us uncouth and void of sense,
And far too apt to give offence,
Merely in order to devote us
To later splendour, and promote us
On our dead selves, as stepping-stones,
To higher things—'twas thus with Jones.

RAILWAY COMPANIONS.
(By a Disagreeable Traveller.)
I.
I HAVE come to the conclusion that the
railway train exercises a sinister influence
upon the human race. Persons who are
tolerable—or even welcome—in ordinary
daily life, become peculiarly obnoxious so
soon as they enter the compartment of a
train. No fairy prince ever stepped into
a railway train—assuming he favoured
that means of locomotion—without being
transformed straightway into a Beast, and
even Beauty herself could not be distin-
guished from her disagreeable sisters—in
a train.
Speaking for myself, railway travelling
invariably brings to the surface all my
worst qualities.
My neighbour opposite hazards some
remark. I feel immediately a fit of
taciturnity coming over me, and an over-
powering inclination to retreat behind a
fortification of journals and magazines.
On the other hand, say that I have
exhausted my stock of railway literature
—or, no remote possibility, that the
literature has exhausted me—then I make
a casual remark about the weather. The
weather is not usually considered a
controversial topic: in railway trains,
however, it becomes so.
"Rain! not a bit," says a passenger in
the far corner, evidently meditating a
walking tour, and he views me suspiciously
as if 1 were a rain-producer.
"And a good thing too," remarks the
man opposite. "It's wanted badly, I tell
you, Sir—very badly. It's all very well
for you holiday folk," &c, &c.
And all this bad feeling because of my
harmless well-intentioned remark.
The window is up. "Phew! . . .
stuffy," says the man opposite. "You
don't mind, I hope, the window—
eh?" "Not in the least," I say, and
conceive a deadly hatred for him.
I know from experience that directly
that window is down all the winds
of heaven will conspire to rush through,
bearing upon them a smoky pall. I resign
myself, therefore, to possible bronchitis
and inflammation of the eye. Schoolboys,
I may remark by the way, are the worst
window offenders, owing to their dia-
bolical practice of looking out of window
in a tunnel—and, of course, nothing ever
happens to them. What's the use of
expostulating after the compartment is
full of yellow, choking vapour. These
boys should bo leashed together like dogs
and conveyed in the luggage-van.
The window is down. "W-h-oop"
coughs an elderly man. "Do you mind,
Sir, that window being closed?" Polite
mendacity and inward bitterness on my
part towards the individual who has con-
verted the compartment into an oven.
But there are worse companions even
than these, of whom I must speak another
time. A. R.
THE SONG OP THE SEEDY
BACHELOR.
The world is like a wedding-cake
That once was prodigal of plums;
But fruitless now the search I make,—
Alas! my way no currant comes!
O'er devastated plains of crumbs
A crusty Bachelor I roam;
In vain I saccharine my thumbs,
Sultanaless I wander home!
In vain I probe life's almond paste
To find some raisin gone astray;
No almond eyes illume the waste
Where once a baker's dozen lay.
Alas! no currant comes my way,
Now one would satisfy my greed;
I must, to chase dull carroway,
Inevitably run to seed! R. E. L.

BELGIUM AND THE B.P.
(By our Quite-a-Little-Holiday-making
Impressionist.)
What B.P.? Not the British Public?
Well, yes, the best representative of the
British Public—the British Press. (Cheer*.)
But this is not a speech, but at this point
there would have been left a blank in the
reporter's notebook for applause, and I am
speaking of reporters. And the British
Press, how was it represented? Well,
nowadays, the reporter carries out the
general impression conveyed by the words,
"Gentlemen of the Press." Always did,
but does it now more than ever. Take
the representatives of British journalists
who went to Ostend and Bruges a week or
so since and sample them. Take a third,
say half a dozen. Item, a pressman who
had held a commission R.N., item, a press-
man who had appeared in the Army List,
the rest, members of the Bar. Nothing
incongruous in Burgomasters, general
managers, and such like gentlemen doing
honour to the British Press when so
represented.
Picture a pleasant journey from London
to Dover. On the way down, the relation
of marvellous adventures concerning
foreign lands from the salt with the
pencil. And all true, every one of them.
And yet the rest of the company talk of
ever-interesting Fleet Street with an
occasional dash into the Common Rooms
of the Cam and the Isis, and the last
anecdotes from the Robing Room in
Carey Street, now closed for tho long
vacation. "The boys" who could wear
helmets and horsehair wigs in camp and
Court, but who were now exchanging
straw hats for caps, were ushered on
board one of the splendid vessels of the
State Administration of Railways and
Steamboats in Belgium, and carried across
the ocean to the shore opposite the chalky
cliffs of Albion. The clerk of the weather
was on his best behaviour—did not risk a
practical joke at the expense of the
R.B.P. So the Rapide was worthy of
her name, and the blithesome party were
landed punctual to the moment.
Ostend was hospitable. The R.B.P.
dined with the revered Minister of
Railways, or rather, his admirable
representative. Eloquence was all the
better because it was not reported—save
in the local Ostend papers. At a moment's
notice (possibly accepting a little help) a
respected R.B.P. explained the system of
the State Railways of Belgium, tho luxury
of saloon cars, the delight of a season
ticket, carrying one over tho whole
system, with stoppages, like bread, u
discretion. Then the P.I.J, spoke from
his heart and said the nicest things (to
him) imaginable. Congratulations and
an adjournment to tho ball held at the
largest acreage of hotel in the world.
Did the R.B.P. dance? Certainly. Every
one of them—save those whoso dancing
days were over.
And the next day? The visit to Bruges.
What could have been more luxurious
than the saloon of luxury? What could
have been more impressive than the
reception of the R.B.P. by the Municipality
of Bruges? In a chamber suggestive of
centuries ago the Chief of the Municipal
State welcomed the interesting strangers.
Was French spoken? Wasn't it! First
one Pressman returned thanks in the
French language—over which the great
Thackeray had so complete a mastery—to
the admiration of all beholders. Then the
P.I.J, proposed prosperity to Bruges in a
speech with an accent which was more
Parisian than that of the Parisians. "Nous
sommes freres!" Splendid sentiment—
binding Briton and Belgian in a bond of
union which, &c, &c, &c.
Then to see the monuments. Old
churches, old pictures, restored town
halls, the most ancient archery club in
the world (of whom the late Queen
Victoria was President), a room with the
chair of Reubens in it, a gateway with
apartments overhead, said to have been
once occupied—a long while ago—by a
renowned Archbishop of Canterbury.
Then, after hearing that Bruges was to be
a seaport, thanks to a coming canal, away
to Ostend for dinner and a concert at the
Kursaal.
Was the dinner a success? Quite.
Ostend was so crowded that the banquet
had to be held in a room partly occupied by
other guests. But what mattered that?
Could not the Burgomaster tell his guests
how the Belgians loved the British?
Could not the ever-eloquent P.I.J, return
the compliment, and speak of the fetes of
1867, when the Volunteers and the Liege
Riflemen were brothers, as, indeed, they
were in Waterloo year, when they stood
shoulder to shoulder not so many miles
from Brussels? And then away to the
excellent music of the Eursaal and the
glorious moonlight of the beautiful pro-
menade on the sea front.
Oh, what a week's end! The last morn-
ing was passed with a visit to the Exhibi-
tion, which was interesting, and to a
museum of exhibits from the huge collec-
tion, gathered together by the State
traiteur, of the late Duke Alfred of Saxe-
CobuRG GOTHA. Then, by the good ship
CU.mentine, home to Dover. Clementine
**e swift, Clementine the scientific —
■,vas there not a wireless telegraphic
conversation between Belgium and Eng-
land conducted from the deck of the State
packot ? — Clementine tho luxuriously
furnished and punctually up-to-time.
From Dover to London by S.E. and C.R.
also satisfactory.
And so the dream of swords, pens,
barristers' wigs, reporters' pencils, seas,
sands, hotels, balls, vins d'honneiir,
capital yarns, delightful talk, excellent
speeches in admirable English and more
than admirable French came to an end.
Thanks to the ever-courteous manager, to
whom the State Administration owes so
much, thanks to the standard-bearer who
carried the flag of Britain ten years ago to
Belgium, thanks to the worthy representa-
tive of the B.P., who maintained the best
traditions of English journalism. Thanks
all round.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
MRS. MEDWIN.
By Henry James.
I.
"Well, we are a pair!" the poor lady's visitor broke out to
her, at the end of her explanation, in a manner disconcerting
onough. The poor lady was Miss Cutter, who lived in South
Audley Street, where she had an " upper half" so compact that
it might have passed for convenient; and her visitor was her
half-brother, whom she had not seen for three years. She was
remarkable for a maturity of which every symptom might have
been observed to be admirably controlled, had not a tendency
to stoutness just affirmed its independence. Her present, no
doubt, insisted too much on her past, but with the excuse,
sufficiently valid, that she must certainly once have been
prettier. She was clearly not contented with once—she wished
to be prettier again. She neglected nothing that could produce
that illusion, and, being both fair and fat, dressed almost
wholly in black. When she added a little colour it was not, at
any rate, to her drapery. Her small rooms had the peculiarity
that everything they contained appeared to testify with
vividness to her position in society, quite as if they had been
furnished by the bounty of admiring friends. They were
adorned indeed almost exclusively with objects that nobody
buys, as had more than once been remarked by spectators of
her own sex, for herself, and would have been luxurious if
luxury consisted mainly in photographic portraits slashed across
with signatures, in baskets of flowers be-ribboned with the
cards of passing compatriots, and in a neat collection of red
volumes, blue volumes, alphabetical volumes, aids to London
lucidity, of every sort, devoted to addresses and engagements.
To be in Miss CUTTER'S tiny drawing-room, in short, even with
Miss Cutter alone—should you by any chance have found her
so—was somehow to be in the world and in a crowd.
This was what the tall, lean, loose gentleman lounging there
before her might have appeared to read in the suggestive scene,
over which, while she talked to him, his eyes moved without
haste and without rest. "Oh, come, Mamie! " he occasionally
threw off; and the words were evidently connected with the
impression thus absorbed. His comparative youth spoke of
waste even as her positive—her top-positive—spoke of economy.
There was only one thing, that is, to make up in him for every-
thing he had lost—though it was distinct enough indeed that
this thing might sometimes serve. It consisted in the perfec-
tion of an indifference, an indifference at the present moment
directed to the plea—a plea of inability, of pure destitution—
with which his sister had met him. Yet it had even now a
wider embrace; took in quite sufficiently all consequences of
queerness, confessed in advance to the false note that, in such
a setting, he almost excruciatingly constituted. He cared as
little that he looked at moments all his impudence as that he
looked all his shabbiness, all his cleverness, all his history.
These different things were written in him, in his premature
baldness, his seamed, strained face, the lapse from bravery of
his long tawny moustache, above all in his easy, friendly,
universally acquainted eye, so much too sociable for mere con-
versation. What possible relation with him could bo natural
enough to meet it? He wore a scant, rough Inverness cape and
a pair of black trousers, wanting in substance and marked with
the sheen of time, that had presumably once served for evening
use. Ho spoke with the slowness helplessly permitted to
Americans—as something too slow to be stopped; and he
repeated that he found himself associated with Miss Cutter in
a harmony worthy of wonder. She had been telling him not
only that she couldn't possibly give him ten pounds, but that
his unexpected arrival, should he insist on being much in view,
might seriously interfere with arrangements necessary to her
own maintenance; on which he had begun by replying that he
of course knew she had long ago spent her money, but that he
looked to her now exactly because she had without tho aid of
that convenience mastered the art of life.
"I'd really go away with a fiver, my dear, if you'd only tell
me how you do it. It's no use saying only, as you've always
said, that' people are very kind to you.' What the devil arc
they kind to you /or?"
"Well, one reason is precisely that no particular incon-
venience has hitherto been supposed to attach to me. I'm just
what I am," said Mamie Cutter; "nothing less and nothing
more. It's awkward to have to explain to you—which,
moreover, I really needn't in the least. I'm clever and amusing
and charming." She was uneasy and even frightened; but she
kept her temper and met him with a grace of her own. "I
don't think you ought to ask me more questions than I ask
you."
"Ah, my dear," said the odd youngman, " I've no mysteries.
Why in the world, since it was what you came out for and have
devoted so much of your time to, haven't you'pulled it off?
Why haven't you married?"
"Why haven't you? " she retorted. "Do you think that if I
had, it would have been better for you?—that my husband
would for a moment have put up with you? Do you mind my
asking you if you'll kindly go nowt" she went on after a
glance at the clock. "I'm expecting a friend, whom I must
see alone, on a matter of great importance"
"And my being seen with you may compromise your respecta-
bility or undermine your nerve?" He sprawled, imperturbably,
in his place, crossing again, in another sense, his long black
legs and showing, above his low shoes, an absurd reach of parti-
coloured sock. "I take your point well enough, but mayn't
you be, after all, quite wrong? If you can't do anything for
me, couldn't you at least do something with me? If it comes
to that, I'm clever and amusing and charming too! I've been
such an ass that you don't appreciate me. But people like me
—1 assure you they do. They usually don't know what an ass
I've been; they only see the surface; which "—and he
stretched himself afresh as she looked him up and down—" you
can imagine them, can't you, rather taken with? I'm 'what I
am ' too; nothing less and nothing more. That's true of us as
a family, you see. We ore a crew!" He delivered himself
serenely; his voice was soft and flat ; his pleasant eyes, his
simple tones, tending to the solemn, achieved at moments that
effect of quaintness which is, in certain connections, socially
so known and enjoyed. "English people have quite a weakness
for me—more than any others. I get on with them beautifully.
['ve always been with them abroad. They think me," the
young man explained, "diabolically American."
"You!" Such stupidity drew from her a sigh of compassion.
Her companion apparently quite understood it. "Are you
homesick, Mamie?" he asked with wondering irrelevance.
Tho manner of the question made her for some reason, in spite
of her preoccupations, break into a laugh. A shade of
indulgence, a sense of other things, came back to her. "You
ire funny, SOOTT !''
"Well," remarked Scott, "that's just what I claim. But
are you so homesick?" he spaciously inquired; not as if to a
practical end, but from an easy play of intelligon6o.
"I'm just dying of it!" said Mamie Cjtter.
"Why, so ami!" Her visitor had a sweetness of con-
currence.
"We're the only decent people," Miss Cutter declared.
"And I know. You don't—you can't; and I can't explain.
Come in," she continued with a return of her impatience and an
increase of her decision, " at seven sharp."
Sho had quitted her seat some time before, and now, to get
him into motion, hovered before him while, still motionless, ho
looked up at her. Something intimate, in the silence, appeared
to pass between them—a community of fatigue and failure and,
after all, of intelligence. There was a final, cynical humour
in it. It determined him, at any rate, at last, and he slowly

rose, taking in again, as he stood there, the testimony of the room.
He might have been counting the photographs, but he looked
at the flowers with detachment. "Who's coming?"
"Mrs. Med win."
"American?"
"Dear, no!"
'' Then what are you doing if or hep?'' i
"I work for everyone," she promptly returned.
"For everyone
who pays? So I
suppose. Yet isn't
it only we who do
pay?"
There was a drol-
lery, not lost on
her, in the way his
queer presence
lent itself to his
emphasized plural.
"Do you consider
that youl&o?"
At this, with his
deliberation, |hc
came back to his
charming idea.
"Only try me, and
see if I can 't be
made to. Work me
in." Onhersharply
presenting her
back he stared a
little at the clock.
"If I come at
seven, may I stay
to dinner?"
It brought her
round again. "Im-
possible. I'm din-
ing out."
"With whom?"
She had to think.
"With Lord Con-
SIDINE."
"Oh, my eye!"
Scott exclaimed.
She looked at
him gloomily. "Is
that sort of tone
what makes you
pay? I think you
might under-
stand," she went
on, " that if you 're
to sponge on me
successfully you
mustn't ruin me.
I must have some
remote resem-
blance to a lady."
"Yes? But why must I?" Her exasperated silence was full
of answers; of which, however, his inimitable manner took no
account. "You don't understand my real strength—I doubt
if you even understand your own. You 're clever, Mamie; but
you're not so clever as I supposed. However," he pursued,
"it's out of Mrs. Medwin that you '11 get it?"
"Get what?"'
"Why, the cheque that will enable you to assist me."
On this, for a moment, she met his eyes. "If you'll come
back at seven sharp—not a minute before, and not a minute
after—I 'II give you two five-pound notes."
He thought it over. "Whom are you expecting a minute
after?"
It sent her to the window with a groan almost of anguish,
and she answered nothing till she had looked at the street.
"If you injure me, you know, SCOTT, you '11 be sorry."
"I wouldn't injure you for the world. What I want to do,
in fact, is really to help you, and I promise you that I won't
leave you—by which I mean won't leave London—till I've
effected something
really pleasant for
you. I like you,
Mamie — because
I like pluck; I like
you much more
than you like me.
I like you very,
very much." He
had at last, with
this, reached the
door and opened
it, but he remained
with his hand on
the latch. "What
does Mrs. Medwin
want of you? " he
thus brought out.
She had come
round, to see him
disappear, and in
the relief of this
prospect she again
just indulged him.
"The impossible."
He waited ano-
ther minute. "And
you 're going to do
it?"
"I'm going to
doit," said Mamie
Cutter.
"Well then, that
ought to be a
haul'. Call it
three fivers!" he
laughed. "At
seven sharp." And
at last he left her
alone.

ADA CAMBRIDGE—(Mrs. or Miss? From her frank confidences
on the married state and what it involves, my Baronite sus-
pects the latter. Those who have suffered are more reticent)—
is almost monotonous in the misery in which she envelopes her
households. It is a game of cross purposes all through. If
Dr. Dallas, or Keith Macdonald, had married Peggy, all would
have been well, and if Harry Bedingfleld had married Mimi
Carter it would have served him right. But they don't. On
the contrary, each marries the wrong one (Mimi does it four
times, of course in succession), and complications and disasters
duly follow. Tlieso Miss Cam-
BBIDGB manages with con-
siderable skill, succeeding In
holding the attention of the
reader to the end, where he is
rewarded by coming upon quite
a little novel by itself. This is
t he story of Gordon le Marchand
and his wife. Here Ada revels
in the wealth of her ideas of
the usual sort of thing in the
average British household.
Gordon marries Eleanor when
both were ordinarily young
and extraordinarily handsome.
They quarrel; she goes home
to her mother; he makes love
elsewliere; she gets a divorce
and marries again; he remains
singlo and rails against beauty
in woman; her second husband
dies ; on what might have been
their silver wedding day Gordon
and Eleanor moet on the very
spot whore a quarter of a cen-
tury earlier they started on
their honeymoon; they make
it up, marry again, and live
happy ever afterwards. My
Baronite's Advice to those
About to Marry is, "Read
The Devastators."
In The Skirts of Happy
Chance (Methukn), Mr.
Marriott "Watson relates the
adventures of Francis, second
son of the late Marquess of
Auriol. They are delightful,
and are told with a literary art and skill that add much to the
enjoyment of the reader. It is quite possible they might not
have been written had there been no Lunatic at Large. But my
Baronite does not suggest that as a reproach or a drawback.
In a weary world ho is too grateful for a hearty laugh to quarrel
with the benefactor.
"There is, as it seems to me," quoth the Baron reflectively,
"a considerable difficulty in 'placing' Mr. Anthony Hope's
latest romance, Tristram of Blent (John Murray). The plot
is simple to a fault: and the story, as worked out by the
marked individuality of the characters through a series of
well-pointed dialogues, striking scenes, and dramatic situations,
is, if not absorbing, enticingly interesting. Whethor the family
idiosyncrasies of the Tristrams of Blent are likely to recommend
themselves to the reader as among the probabilities of life
which are not of the merely ordinary type, is a question the
Baron would not undertake to answer in tho affirmative.
Neither hero nor heroine of this romance is in any sort of way a
lovable character, nor is there anyone among them whose better

acquaintance tho Baron would be desirous of cultivating. Such
a criticism, however, may be a tribute to the truth of the
author's portraiture. Not a single opportunity is afforded to
tho 'skipper' for exercising his mental agility over so many
pages at a time, or even over any part of a page. Dialogue or
description, it is all good reading; although the author's fond-
ness for dropping into parentheses is amusingly irritating. The
title is not a good one, as to many readers besides the Baron tho
suggestion will occur that to have styled the novel Josiah
Clwlderton's Journal would have been far better. And, while
on the subject of titles, it is in fancy nomenclature that the in-
ventive faculty of Mr. Anthony Hope Hawkins is at its weakest.
He attempts, after the manner of Thackeray and Trollopk,
to create titles that will be
suggestive not only of exist-
ing ones, but of the distin-
guished individuals who bear,
or have borne, them. What
can be more misleading than
the name of Disney as that
of the Prime Minister (with
the Christian name of
llobert), coupled with such a
description of tho personal
appearance of its owner as
might possibly identify the
character with Lord Ripon?
Then Viscount Broadstairs
(Disney's private secretary),
'eldest son of the Earl of
Ramsgate ' (and, he might have
added, 'first cousin to tho
Marquis of Margate'), is
simply the sort of burlesque
title that Thackeray might
have used in Jeames's Diary,
or in the Yellowplns't Papers.
In another line he writes,
'Birch & Co., the famous
furnishers,' evidently wish-
ing his readers to ni te how
slily humorous he can be
when he wishes to indicate,
without plainly mentioning,
'Messrs. Maple & Co.' [or
'Sons,' tho Baron forgets
which it is]. Presumably, the
Tristrams of Blent, being a
very ancient family, were
Catholics np to the Reforma-
tion, and then saved their
estate by conforming to the new order. This circumstance
must be taken for granted in the story, otherwise Mr. Anthony
Hope would have been confronted by a difficulty which not
only would have given full scope for tho play of his inventive
powers, but would have intensified the interest in an excep-
tional manner. It is not," says the Baron, "for me to give
away this idea, which may have occurred to Mr. Anthony Hope,
and in which he may have foreseen difficulties which he refused
to tackle. However, as it is, the interest is sufficient to carry
the reader from a pleasant start to a satisfactory finish, with-
out causing him the smallest pang of regret at parting with
any one of tho characters. The story has served its purposo,
wild tout." The Baron dk B.-W.

interests, in thought, the woman of forty at the
present day is as young as her daughter less than

Who for ever is forsworn,
That her beauties may not weigh
'Gainst the charms that thee adorn.
Let her not my heart enthral
With her dangerous dignity:
Thou wert to me all in all
Till mamma came sweeping by.
In her thoughts, her ways, her dress,
Such alluring grace I find;
Nor can I my love repress
Of her equal balanced mind.
Roving go my lover's eyes
Every time mamma appears
With a splendour that defies
All her two times twenty years.
Take, then, take mamma away,
Let her not infatuate me,
Or lead my poor heart astray,

VERBAL ENDINGS.
A year ago, to wit, before
The General Election,
This everlasting campaign wore
The rosiest complexion:
The Boers were beaten out and out,
Our men were simply splendid;
In short, the war, beyond a doubt,
Was practically ended.
But though the Boers—benighted crew—
Were obviously routed,
Like Wellington at Waterloo,
The notion still they scouted;
And so, that we might not be blamed
If war was not suspended,
We called it murder and proclaimed
It technically ended.
And yet, despite assurance clear,
Despite our best endeavour,
The casualty lists appear
About as long as ever.
When these I see, it seems to me
Quite time that things were mended,
And that this weary war should be,
Say, genuinely ended.
AN ENGLISHMAN'S LOVE-LETTER.
An Open Offer.
Lady, tell me may I love thee?
I 've a heart can beat for two;
I will vow there's none above thee,
If thou wilt but let me woo.
Let me prove my heart's devotion
With what grace I may and can,
Humour the fantastic notion
Of a literary man!
I '11 not ask that thou be rather
Under than above three score,
Or that thou shouldst have a father
With a million pounds or more.
Some would ask a queen exquisite
To reign o'er their heart's domi-
nion.
I don't. Loveliness, what is it
But a matter of opinion?
Lady, only let me love thee
In a literary way,
With my fervour I will move thee
If thou wilt but say I may.
Thou mayst be as fair as Venus,
Or a lamentable fright,
Only let there be between us
An arrangement definite.
Lady, I don't ask to wed thee,
Or to take thee by the hand.
If, unconsciously, I've fed thee
With vain hopes, pray understand—
Decorous will be such passion
As I venture to propose,
Ruled by the prevailing fashion,
And susceptible to prose.
I shall pour out my affection
In a letter day by day.
Thou wilt have a nice collection
By the end of—April, say.
Letters couched in phrase erotic
(Suitable for calf or leather),
I shall touch on every topic
From hysteria to the weather.
And when, in a dainty cover,
My effusions thou shalt see,
Titled: Spasms of a Lover,
I believe thou wilt agree,
Though we never met nor mated,
If the sales we can maintain
Of the volume herewith stated,
We shall not have loved in vain.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 4, 1901.
MR. PUNCH'S MUSEUM.
[It is stated that a Museum of Local Antiquities
is about to be founded at Fulham. Other districts
of the Metropolis will doubtless follow suit, with
curious and obsolete exhibits.]
West End Collection.
Exhibit No. 1. "Sandwich-man (temp
1900)." Preserved in spirits of wine.
This quaint antique was one of the last
survivors of a somewhat eccentric method
of advertising, adopted by our ancestors
at the end of the nineteenth century.
Of exceedingly dejected and miserable
appearance in life-time owing to the diffi-
culty of obtaining a sufficiency of strong
drink on a pittance of one shilling per
diem, he has now acquired a cheerful
and even jaunty demeanour through the
superabundance of alcohol now permeat-
ing his system.
No. 37. "Part of a London Bus.
Early Edwardian (VII., not VI.). These
strange vehicles came to be known as
Penny, or Twopenny, Ovens, from the
singular reluctance of their proprietors
to provide the passengers with adequate
ventilation in hot weather, even so late
as the beginning of the twentieth cen
tury. No complete specimen is known to
exist, as during the Great Heat Wave of
1902, they were one and all reduced to
fragments by their exasperated occu
pants.
No. 666. "Hide of a Shouting iVems-
vendor." These offensive creatures were
at one time quite common in the streets of
London. They were remarkable for their
throat and lungs, which were made of
leather; also for their thick skins, im-
pervious to the attentions of passers-by
or police. They were gradually tanned
out of existence.
No. 607. "Coat-tail of the last Hyde
Park Orator." A venerable relic which
represents all that could bo secured by
the constables who chased its owner over
the railings. This sub-order is now
happily extinct, unlike some of its
congeners of the Obstructive Party in
Parliament.
No. 668. "Orinding-organ." Period,
late Victorian; complete with monkey
(stuffed), and working models of attendant
Italian family. N.B.—Any person handling
this particular exhibit will be condemned
to penal servitude for life. It was only
with the greatest difficulty that these
noxious pests were extirpated from London
life, as they long defied all by-laws and
street regulations. The instrument is
charged with the deadly air of the
"Absent-minded Beggar," which used to
incite its hearers to battle, murder and
sudden death, and therefore must on no
account be resuscitated.
No. 669. "Music-score and Obsolete
Brass Implements." Supposed to belong
to a German band before these were sup-
pressed. The peculiarity of this very
primitive composition is that it makes no
difference whether the score is played
right side up, upside down, forwards or
backwards. It was the only tune the
performers knew, and variations were
obtained by each taking his own time and
key simultaneously. The brass - ware
appears to have undergone severe treat-
ment and shows marks of kicks, probably
aimed at the operators, who doubtless
used these exhibits as means of defence
as well as offence in some emeute
LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. I. (Concluded.)
Some twenty years went by. The school
Where Jones was deemed a graceless fool
Whom nothing was excused to,
Still stood upon a hill-top high,
Its turrets pointing to the sky
Precisely as they used to.
The shouts, the tramp of boyish feet,
The masters' houses in the street,
Rented at quite a stiff rent;
The games, the tasks, the furtive Bohn—
All were the same; the boys alone
Were, though they seemed not , different.
Oh, day of days, oh, joy that I
Should be this day's recorder!
The sun came out, the hours went by
In their appointed order.
The Prefects looked like little kings,
And every impish urchin
Wore all the tasteful Sunday things
He mostly went to Church in.
The masters, if some fault was done,
Showed a benignant blindness:
They smiled as though their life was one
Unbroken round of kindness.
The fathers came, an eager crowd,
And with them came the mothers;
Sisters were bashfully allowed
To walk and talk with brothers.
This was, in short—permit the phrase—
No day of blame, no teach-day,
But jiist our day for prize and praise—
In fact it was our Speech-Day.
A boy came on the dais dressed
(A tall and comely fellow)
In swallow-tails and low-cut vest
To represent Othello.
Another, garbed the same as he,
Whose pride it was to own a
Bass voice, expired in agony
As Lady Desdemona.
Tell, Harpagon, and (Edipus,
We lumped them all together:
In evening clothes they spoke to us,
And pumps of patent leather.
And though (in Greek) they feigned
despair,
And then (in French) grew skittish,
The accents that they talked in were
Imperially British.
The speeches ended, the Headmaster rose;
He hemmed, ho hawed, and then he blew
his nose,
Spoke of his pride at being there and
greeting
So many friends at this their annual
meeting.
Glanced, as he spoke, at Harrow and at
Eton,
But held that Rodwell's record was un-
beaten:
In every point, in scholarship, in tone,
In sports, in numbers Rodwell held its own
Its grounds were large, its buildings were
extensive,
Its air was good, its fees were inexpensive
All things, in fact, combined—as all things
should—
To make it better while they kept it good.
"Amongst our old Rodwellians one," he
said,
"Is here to-day whose fame is widely
spread;
A man of genius, tempered by sobriety,
Of learning made sublimely great by piety.
I was his friend at school; 1 knew him
well;
No words of mine are adequate to tell
The story of his boyish deeds—I mean
The Bishop "—here he glowed—" of Peck-
ham Green.
He, as each one of you, of course, sur-
mises,—
You know his goodness,—will present the
prizes."
Of Bishops many have I seen,
But none so nobly meek or
So mildly large as Peckham Green,
Whose signature was " Pecor."
Fate had not done tlie thing by halves,
Nor had she meanly catered
For one with such a pair of calves
So admirably gaitered.
On all the best of boiled and roast
His being he had grounded:
What came beneath his chest was most
Episcopally rounded.
He rose, a gorgeous presence, and
He laid his views before us;
His voice was dignified but bland,
His attitude decorous.
In all you do, in all you try,
Strive for the perfect tense, boys;
If," he went on, "your aim is high,
You won't hit low: that's sense, boys.
When I was but a little boy
I tried to guide each action
To give my worthy parents joy,
My masters satisfaction.
And now—" he paused; we gave a shout;
We understood his thesis;
Our wild applausive yells filled out
The aposiopesis.
But while the cheers still rent the sky,
And while the air was humming,
Dim memories of days gone by
Kept obstinately coming.
Somehow, I felt, I knew those tones—
Great Zeus! how shall I tell it ?—
I recognised the idiot Jones
In Peckham's portly prelate!

"Yes; but we never look at anything marked 'Private.'"
"MAN(EUVRES."
Well-kept lawns, and marquees long,
Of Unionists almighty throng;
See, they come in thousands strong
In the season of Manoeuvres.
In " country dress" they 're all arrayed,
The staunchest ones, and those who've
strayed;
For demonstrating is simply grand,
With lunch thrown in and a vintage
brand
As part of the mad Manoeuvres.
They would sooner leave for Moors and
grouse,
But they deem it wise outside the House
To explain what they propose to do
To settle the fractious Irish crew;
So forty odd of the rowdy boys
They seek to rob of St. Stephen's joys.
If the forty left make double noise,
Well, what of these new Manoeuvres?
Yeoman back from veldt and fray,
Yeoman waiting his promised pay,
Haunts Pall Mall from day to day
Because of its mad Manoeuvres.
"The pay-sheet's lost," someone com-
plains.

He's paid one score, but he's got to wait
Before his own's wiped off the slate,
With these muddled up Manoeuvres.
But what's the odds? He's only fought;
Just been where the "jolly lesson's"
taught
(For "jolly " it's called in poet's song).
But he's "jolly" sure it's "jolly" wrong,
Though cash is due, he should have to
stay
Waiting till Government sees its way
To follow the Jingo cry and "pay,"
And stop these mean Manoeuvres.

FAIR'S FAIR(?).
[Mr. Havelock Ellis, in an article on the
Comparative Abilities of the Fair and the Dark in
the last Monthly Serine, proves by statistics that
men of action are generally fair, while men of
thought are dark. Those who hare the highest
"index of pigmentation," and are therefore
fairest, are political reformers, sailors and soldiers;
at the dark end of the scale are actresses and
professional beauties.]
Poets, since the days of Homer
Down to Onions, all have erred,
Cherishing a sad misnomer
Making all their odes absurd.
Briefly, what I have to tell is
From a current magazine,
Where ungallant Mr. Ellis
Says that "fair" ?iot fair should
mean.
Paradoxic is his thesis—
Beauty's dark, and dark is fair,
Fair is ugly; so to pieces
Idylls fall beyond repair.
Neither flaxen-haired nor florid
Is the veritable belle;
Figures with percentage horrid
Thus our pained assent compel I
This iconoclast unruly
Dares the dreadful fact to hint:—
"Fair ones" should be darkies truly,
Or, at least, a swarthy tint.
In his scale of pigmentation
First come socialists and tars;
They 're the fairest of the nation,
Followed next by sons of Mars.
Last upon the list he places
Those with colour-index low;
Darkest are the brightest Graces
Whom as actresses we know.
Spite of powder and peroxide,
Dark is light and gay and bright;
Ladies will their auburn locks hide
Now with wigs as black as night 1
So the bard will sing, when jilted,
"If she be not dark to me"
(Though the phrase is fairly stilted),
"What care I how dark she be 1"
Farewell, author greatly daring—
Lest the fair think you unfair,
And, when next you forth are faring,
Hold Judge LYNCH's fair, beware!
A. A. S.
Query by Old Westminster Wag.—It
is to be noted that Whitehall and
Parliament Street are now being relaid
with blocks of red gum. Is this in any
way connected with the healthy state of
the mouth of the Nation at St. Stephens?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 4, 1901.
THE BOOK OP BEAUTY.
A Great Thought for Every Day in the Year.
Second Series.
VIII.—THE MRS. HUMPHRY WARD SECTION.
(Continued from August.)
AUGUST 17th.—The path up to the moor lay through hanging
woods lush with dew, alive with the stir of nature. Hellsmere's
eyes, lifted from the page of Hume's Essays, fell on a great flr-
trunk with its russet-red that seemed, under a cloudy sky, to
retain the fire of departed suns. How was that for an image of
the survival of religious emotions still aglow with the colour
of discarded creeds?
18th, 19th.—The train of thought to which this figure gave
an impulse was disturbed by a flash of gold plumage. A cock-
pheasant went whirring through the brake. A squirrel, beady-
eyed and tawny-brushed, peered from a pine and pursued his
spiral ascent. Here and there went the bobbing of rabbits'
tails speeding to shelter. Over the broad leaves of water-
lilies lying flat on the surface of a dusky pool, a moor-hen
hurried, dryfoot, like Israel's host, to the further bank. Hells-
mere became subconsciously aware that all these furred and
feathered creatures were actuated by a common passion for
self-preservation, expressing itself in various manifestations
according to their respective shapes and habits. What more
natural! What else, indeed, was the human cry for immor-
tality but this same instinct in a form perhaps more spiritual,
certainly more sanguine? Could it be possible, he asked him-
self, that the analogy went further? That the Powers above,
in the careless calm attributed to them by the Lucretian
philosophy, had no deeper designs on our existence than he,
Hellsmere, had at that moment on these denizens of the
woods?
20th.—And yet with them it was not mere untutored instinct
that warned them to seek safety. There had been rude and
bitter experience. Pheasants had been killed; though not, he
hoped, in August. As for rabbits, they were a perpetual prey.
What, indeed, was his objective at that moment? Was it not
the destruction of certain forms of life? primarily the grouse,
incidentally the hare, and, conceivably, the snipe? A divine
shame smote his heart as he felt in the game-pocket of his coat
and brought out a copy of the Canticle of the Creatures.
21st, 22nd.—And now the moor stretched before him, sweeping
up the long low braes of Athol, chequered with purple patches,-
here flaunting the conscious symmetry of a draught-board, there
counterfeiting the dappled shadows of the milch-kine of Apollo.
The guns spread out into line. The dogs, unleashed, bounded
forward with drooped necks and sentient nostrils lifted up the
wind. Not even then could Hellsmere escape from his attitude
of mental absorption. Though an early predilection for ratting
had remained among the most poignant memories of his child-
hood, his subsequent trend had been towards metaphysics
rather than pure animalism. Of a disposition too analytical for
the comparative directness and simplicity of vision required in
a perfect sportsman, he had sometimes, on occasions like the
present, been tempted to follow up a line of abstract reasoning
—associated, perhaps, with the identity of his ego—even when a
crisis, such as the opportunity for a right and left, had seemed
to demand instantaneous action. This tendency had from time
to time been detrimental in its effects upon the bag.
23rd.—And to-day he could not throw off a certain obsession
of mind caused by his reflections upon the Canticle of St.
Francis. On reaching the commencement of the beat he had
handed this work, along with Hume's Essays, Bishop Berkeley's
Sermons, and Sesame and Lilies to the man who was carrying
his cartridges; but the words, ''Praise Heaven for our sister
the grouse," kept ringing in his ears.
24th.—The question, too, of intuition in dogs arrested his
fancy. He derived an appreciable ecstasy from differentiating
between the instinct of a pointer for the scent of the living,
and that of a retriever for the scent of the dead or dying.
How far were these qualities inherent in their natures, and how
far were they a matter of training? And why, in whatever
proportions inherited and acquired, were they more permanent
in animals than in men? Why, for instance, had he outgrown
his taste for Presbyterianism? and was it possible for him to
revert to it by the mere process of reproducing the geographical
conditions which evolved it?
25th.—Fascinated by the field of argument opened up by
these enigmas, he was dimly conscious of the subdued voice
of the head-keeper inviting him to "take a point." Mechani-
cally he walked towards the dog, that stood poised like a rigid
simulacrum of itself; mechanically he advanced beyond it,
moving as in a dream; faintly murmuring, "For our sister
the grouse."
26th.—A sudden nausea seized him, to the partial oblitera-
tion of the landscape. Was it to be tolerated that humanity,
not content with the use of lethal weapons diabolically pre-
cise, must needs employ the instincts of one of the lower orders
of creation for the annihilation of a sister existence? Surely
the whole question of our moral responsibility to these lower
forms, whether we label ourselves Positivist, Deist, or
Orthodox, was here involved. If we hypothecate the exis-
tence of higher powers, can wo count it consistent with
their Divine nature to play off humanity against humanity for
their own better sport? A Pagan doctrine, only excusable in
the makers of Trojan and collateral myths.
27th to 29th.—And yet—but it was at this point of his
internal argument that the birds got up and went away un-
scathed. Nor was this all; for the lamentable accident
which ensued was a further tribute to the complexity of
Hellsmere's organism. The desperate character of his reflec-
tions had reduced him to a state of acute scepticism, in which
he even permitted himself to doubt tho actuality of all
phenomena. A wave of subjectivity passed over him. Meanwhile
he had, as if automatically, raised his gun in the direction of
one of the rising birds and placed his finger on the trigger
of the right barrel. The natural completion of this action
was arrested by an inanition of will-power consequent upon
the absence of his mind. The arrest was, however, only
temporary. Before he could disengage his mind from the con-
clusion that all phenomena wore alike in the quality of non-
existence, he had performed a kind of reflex movement—the
result of associated ideas—and pressed the trigger home. This
happened—in even less time than has been required for the
narration of events—at the moment when his gillie, after
remarking, "Hoot! mon; they're awa'," and advancing with-
out further comment, had reached the position vacated by the
bird at which Hellsmere had pointed his gun.
30th.—By great good fortune, the major and more crowded
portion of the discharge was intercepted by Bishop Berkeley's
Sermons, which the man was carrying in an empty game-bag
slung across his back. Only the outlying shot lodged in his
actual body. To the inconvenience caused by these pellets
Hellsmere alluded coldly in the language of Christian Science,
urging that the injury was apparent rather than real; but when
representations were made to him subsequently in the gun-
room, he cancelled his obligations in conformity with the usual
tariff arranged for these regrettable incidents, the scale of
charges being regulated according to the part of the person
affected.
31ST. — The account of this contretemps, appearing in the
North British papers on the very day of the publication of
his work on Italian Liberty, created a great sensation in the
literary world, and established the success of the volume. It
was natural, therefore, that his immediate accession to the
ranks of the Broader Vegetarianism should have been a painful
shock to the friends who had prophesied for him a political

When summer skies grew clouded,
And blasts blew chill and keen,

Who may not be neglected.
And at your sojourn though
Tended and nursed and petted,
Yet, when at length you go,
You leave me unregretted.

Dear Mr. Punch, — This is a spot,
which, according to your instructions, I
reached last evening. In these same in-
structions you described it as " a growing
place." I fancy it must be of the aspara-
gus order, that vegetable, as you are well
aware, taking three years in which to
develop itself to perfection. Highbury-
barn-on-Sea is, I regret to say, in the first
stage—judged from an asparagus point of
view. I cannot entertain the enthusiastic
description of the candid correspondent.
(I refer to the cutting forwarded by you
from an eminent daily paper under the
heading, "By the Golden Ocean.") He
describes it as "an oasis on the desert
coast of Great Britain." Far be it from
me to deny the desert—all I object to is
the oasis.
I ask you, Sir, if you ever, in the course
of the travels in which you have out-
rivalled Stanley, Cameron, Livingstone,
Harry de Windt, and, may I add, De
Rougemont, ever came across an oasis
consisting of two score villas, built with
scarcely baked bricks,'reposing on an arid
waste amid a number of tumbled-down
cottages, and surmounted by a mighty
workhouse-like hotel looking down on a
pre-Adamite beershop?
The sky was blue, the air was fresh, the
waves had retreated to sea when I arrived
in a jolting omnibus at Highburybarn-on-
Sea, and deposited myself and luggage at
the Metropolitan Hotel. A page-boy was
playing airs on a Jew's - harp when I
alighted on the sand-driven steps of the
hostelry. He seemed surprised at my
arrival, but in most respectful fashion
placed his organ of minstrelsy in his j
jacket pocket, the while he conveyed my
Gladstone bag to my apartment, secured
by an interview with an elderly dame,
who gave an intelligent but very wan
smile when I suggested dinner. She
referred me to the head waiter. This
functionary pointed in grandiose fashion
to the coffee-room, wherein some artistic
wall - papering wag had committed
atrocities on which it would be libel to
comment.
There was only one occupant, a short
clean-shaven gentleman with white hair
and a red nose, who was apparently
chasing space. This turned out to be a
militant blue-bottle. Meantime, the
head-waiter produced his bill of fare, or
rather the remains of it. Nearly every
dish had apparently been consumed, for
the most tempting plats were removed
from the menu by a liberal application of
red pencil. Finally, I decided on a fried
solo and a steak. The white-haired man
still pursued the blue-bottle.
I went up to my room, and after
washing with no soap I returned to the
coffee-room. The blue-bottle still had!
j the best of it. The head-waiter, after
the lapse of an hour, informed me that
the sole would not be long. When it
arrived, I found that he spoke the truth.
If you have any recollection of the repast
which Porthos endured when entertained
by Madame Coquenard, you will have some
notion of my feast. The head-waiter told
me that some bare-legged persons who
had waded into the water were shrimp-
catchers. I only wished that I were one
of them, for at least they found food.
Later on I retired to rest. I was
visited in the hours of darkness, to
which I had consigned myself, by a horde
of mosquitoes, imported, so I was informed
in the morning, by American travellers,
who never tipped the waiters. I fulfilled
their obligations, still gazing on the
auburn sand-drift, still looking on the sea,
still feeling hungry and murmuring to my-
self, "Highburybarn-on-Sea would be a
capital place for children, if I could only
see any cows." A melancholy cocoa-nut
shy by the station appeared to afford all
the milk in the place.
Yours despondently,
NlBBLETHORPE NOBBS.

170 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 4, 1901.
A TEN DAYS' TRIP.
For "all the good it might do me" (and it has done a lot) I
•was recommended by an eminent medical authority to go to
Norway and back—ten days' trip. "Where do I start from?"
I asked. "Oh," he replied somewhat brusquely, as, having
many patients waiting, he showed me out, "go to Hull." I
thanked him and withdrew. I decided on further inquiry, not
to go to Hull, but to take boat to Christiania from Tilbury.
In this •way I should have more sea, more air, less train,
less trouble. The next thing was to secure berths aboard the
gallant ship, the Wilson-liner Orlando, in plenty of time, as
during the summer holidays the cabins are " bespoke" quite a
month in advance. Being a mere raw, that is, un-Cook'd
English traveller, ignorant of the Norwegian language, and
doubtful as to generally received opinion that "English and
French will take you anywhere" [they won't, as a matter
of fact; or, if they do, they leave you where they've taken
you and refuse to bring you back again], I sent a mercurial
boy to purchase me an inexpensive, handy and pocketable
Cook's Tourists' Handbook for Norway. Primarily intended for
a " personally conducted " Cookian tourist, this book doubtless
fulfils its purpose. Hut a tourist, unattached and unbound, like
myself (and Prometheus), by any vows or solemn obligations to
the Chief Cooks, will do better for himself if he procure some
other guide-book whose line is, to adapt technically theatrical
language, the " general utility business."
First, in this Cook-ery Book I fail to find the Norwegian for
"bath." There is "Vamt Vaud" for "warm water;" but
tho words for "hot" and "cold " do not reward my search.
The Boots, who, according to the printed instructions on the
card in the bedroom, is summoned per three tinkles of electric
bell, shakes despairing head, as also does the Chambermaid,
whom two tinkles "<t la carte" have added to our conclave;
we all three pantomime to each other and shake our heads hope-
lessly. Suddenly a happy thought strikes the Chambermaid,
and she rushes off frantically, returning with a captive waiter,
slim and light-haired, who not only speaks but understands
English. He appears as the Dens ex machina, translates and
explains. "Ah !" exclaim the Chambermaid and Boots, throw-
ing up their hands and smiling brightly, as if the cloud that
had threatened to obscure the sunshine in their lives had been
for once and ever removed.
Then, "Happy thought,"—after my next difficulty, not worth
dwelling upon here, is over,—I write down my orders for the
two following days, and confide these instructions to the poly-
glottic porter of the Hotel Victoria, who, being a first-rate
specimen of "porter with a head on," is worth any number of
Victorian chambermaids and bootses, however ready and will-
ing, with a fair sprinkling of nimble waiters thrown in.
Then, ill this Cook-ery Book, where are the Norwegian names
for the days of the week? Where the word for " to-morrow "?
That the non-arrival of "to-morrow" is proverbial may serve
as an excuse, for its absence from this vocabulary. Messrs.
Cook might with advantago add a page or two to their "voca-
bulary and useful phrases " without overburdening either book
or tourist.
For example, this eighteenpenny handbook gives me, among
other items of comparatively useless or, at least, superfluous
knowledge, "the Legal Boating Tariff." Now, how does this
affect the mere ordinary tourist, myself for example? Am I
going to remain in Norway to learn the language and the
intricacies of the law simply to bring an action against some
boatman for extortion? It sounds improbable. This, and
certain other pieces of gratuitous information, I should class
under the head of "luxurious"; and putting these aside, let
us see how this "guide, philosopher and friend" deals with
"necessities." At haphazard I take an example. There is no
form of words to be addressed to the chambermaid asking her
to "make the room while I am out." Cook's tourists employ-
ing this vocabulary in Norway can ask for "meat," " bacon,"
"fish" (generically), "supper and breakfast" (neither in
detail); but they would find themselves at fault should they
desire "soup," "potatoes," "cutlets," or "-wine." However,
the last can be ordered by selection from the " carte."
Cook's Guide obliges us with "numerals " up to a thousand,
which, of course, is uncommonly useful. "Please," "thanks,"
and "how much?" are all there, "all right" and "take my
things." The regulations as to "Close time for game" are
most useful to "the sportsman," but are waste paper to the
ordinary voyageur.
As for coinage in "Kronin" and "Ohre," I learnt more in
five minutes from the intelligent hall-porter at the Hotel Vic-
toria than I did from a prolonged study of the " tables" in this
Norwegian Cook-ery Book.
Mem.—For "Wilson Line" tickets apply to Messrs. Bott.
Name easily remembered "apropos de Bott." At their office
you will be treated with the most polite attention to all the
details of your requirements, and you will have only yourself
to blame if there is one single detail of the tour left un-
explained.
The one drawback at the commencement is the starting from
Fenchurch Street Station. Such an inconvenient place! So
narrow, cribbed, confined! Such a crowd of people coming out
and going in I Porters at their wits' end 1 Cabs, trucks, carts,
vehicles of all sorts, rammed and jammed up together, appar-
ently in a kind of back yard. Desperate struggles through
crowd after bidding "aurevoir" to the porter who has our bags
and baggage on his truck. Will we ever see him again in this
world? I say "we " not" editorially," but as two of us travel-
ling. Then we are hustled and bustled on to the platform.
(Summer, mind you, and about 95° in tho shade.) "Oh where
and oh where is my little Porter? Oh where on earth can
he be?"—Old song adapted to occasion—"Oh where and
oh where has my (anything) Porter gone?" Train crammed.
Carriages nearly full: mostly quite full. Enftn! At the latest
moment, porter with truck and all luggage! Nay, I will not
use strong language—so—Bless thee, my porter!
Now then, all in to begin the journey, and away we go along
the most depressing line of country, wet or shine, ever devised
by mortal engineer, until we reach Tilbury. Melting day:
exeunt collars; wristbands limp. More porters; more trucks:
on to quay. New porters, a trifle more nautical by this time, as
being in keeping with our approach to river and sea, and remind-
ing me of some of the characters so graphically described by
Mr. Jacobs in Many Cargoes. At last our " cargo" is on board
the good ship Orlando; and we are speedily shown to our
cabins, which seem all " trim and taut," as becomes a well-tried
passenger ship that does the Viking business between England
and Norway, belonging to the "Wilson liner fleet."
I am glad to come aboard: I anticipate a first-rate cruise:
I look forward to a restoration to perfect health, and, with a
kind of amateur emigrant's feeling, to seeing a new life in a
world entirely fresh to me within the next few days; though,
as I bid farewell to Tilbury, it occurs to me that 1 might as
well be going away "for a year and a day," as for only a brief
holiday. Quite up to time the bell rings; "any more for
shore" return by the tender—there are many "tender fare-
wells," waving of handkerchiefs, shoutings, injunctions to mes-
sengers and telegraph boys, and then—we are away!
Suddenly an old song and old tune, not sung or heard of for
years, occurs to me,—it is " Wlien I beheld the anchor weighed,"
—which takes me back .... However, I don't want to be taken
back, but am glad to recognise that we are gliding onwards,
dodging vessels to the right of us, vessels to the left of us,
barges, P. & O. steamers, and any amount of shipping, opening
out to us a zigzag course as the Orlando steadily steams
seawards.
The next point on the horizon is luncheon at 1.30 punctually.
All hands to the menu.

One of the Wagstaff family is on board,
and takes the first opportunity of making
himself known to me. "Good ship,
Orlando," he says; "only why that
namo?" Idon'tknow: whynot? ""Well,
my dear Sir," he returns, with an emphasis
on the "dear," "because, why call the
ship Orlando, when it goes 'O'er Sea
O'i"
I groan in spirit. Wagstaff must be
repressed. Mentally I utter a hope that
he may not be a good sailor. Fortunately,
he is placed at a distant table, where his
old jokes are appreciated by an entirely
new company, and whore he can be amus-
ing without being vulgar, as long, at all
events, as we remain in the river.
THE COMING NAVAL MAN(EUVRES.
(A yam—for consumption by the Marines
—of Fleet Street and the sea.)
"Tt is very serious," said the senior
editor, as he read the document handed to
him by one of his colleagues. "So the
Admiralty will permit no correspondents
to attend the operations?
"It is indeed the case," returned the
other. "Although the fact was published
in the columns of ," and the name of a
well-known journal was murmured, "it is
undeniably true."
"There is only one thing to be done,"
cried the senior editor, striking with his
list the reading-desk in front of him.
"We must charter a vessel of our own,
and start on a voyage of discovery."
"Agreed !" cried the other editors.
"It will be only what we shall have to
do in the next land war if tho censorship
retains the mastery."
"Just so," cried the other editors.
And thus came it to pass that The Lively
Sally — immediately re-christened The
Fourth Estate—was purchased for the
benefit of the Press.
*****
"Now who shall command hor?" asked
the reporter with the longest service.
"Why not you ?'' suggested a youngster
■who had just come from the completion of
his education on the banks of the Isis, and
was fond of sport.
"Always willing to oblige, but the fact
is, I am not quite sure whether I know
the difference between a marline-spike
and a pair of main braces."
"Next, please!" put in a colleague who
had given up the Civil Service for
journalism. "What do you know about
navigation?"
"Well, not much, except when I am
getting up an Admiralty case. Fact is,
too, that my briefs belonged more to
Probate and Divorce than to the other
business of the division—I mean to say,
when I was in practice."
Then of a sudden there was a cry for
"the Admiral."

DIARY OF AN AUTOMOBILIST ABROAD.
Tanoibr, Fkidav.—"Our car makes a dkep impression in Morocco,
my mechanic, who accompanies me, thinks it is not a good country for
he srims to feel the heat more than i do."
Alfonso,
motorino.
"Well, yes," he admitted, "I have
been a naval officer. But then, you see,
I have been everything else. When I
commanded the North Polo Fusiliers,
I recollect"
But there was no time for a yarn. The
Fourth Estate, nee The Lively Sully,
steamed gallantly away, and was soon
miles distant from shore.
"With your permission," said tho newly
appointed CO., " I will open our sealed
orders. As I expected. Short and sweet.
They say, 'Find out what you can, and
transmit same by wireless telegraphy.'
All right, we will."
Tho Press boat went here, tho Press
boat went there, the Press boat went
everywhere.
"Ahoy!" hailed one of the specials,
under the rightful impression that he was
nautical to the tips of his fingers. "I
think I can see the remains of a destroyer
fathoms deep under water."
Field-glasses and search-lights were
brought to bear.
"Right you are," answered the CO.
"Make it so."
And the incident was entered in the
log and passed round for general infor-
mation.
Further discoveries wero made. A
derelict cruiser was met and avoided;
four battleships were seen to bo resting
gracefully on some submarine rocks; and
other interesting details of a kindred
character were noticeable.
At last The Fourth Estate, nee The
Lively Sally, entered a fog, and gently
collided with and all but sank an enor-
mous man-o'-war.
"Ship ahoy!" shouted an officer f rom
H.M.S.
"Ship ahoy!" was tho reply of tho
Press Admiral. "We are The Fourth
Estate, ne'e The Lively Sally, from Fleet
Street, bound for information."
"And I am Commander-in-chief of all
that remains of the British Navy."
"What's the matter ?" asked the Press
Admiral.
"Lost my way. Can you assist me to
get back to head-quarters?"
"Certainly," was the cheery response.
"Always pleased to oblige the defenders
of our country in the hour of their dis-
tress. Follow us."
And the Press boat piloted the battle-
ship back to England, and very properly
received the thanks of the Lords of the
Admiralty.

Beneath the gentle breeze of morn
Beside the brimming river,
Ah, for the silver wavelets gay
With golden water-lily
That gleam a hundred miles away
From hateful Piccadilly.
To hear the birds outpour their joys
In carolling melodious,
Instead of listening to the noise
Of barrel-organs odious;
To lie beneath some spreading oak-
No more a slave to work '11
Be rapture after smuts and smoke
Upon the Inner Circle.
And then to sleep! Each night at ten
To sink in easy slumber;
No more to listen while Big Ben
Some " wee sma' hour" shall number;
To court sweet Morpheus to the strains
Of nightingales—oh, that'll
Be better than these whistling trains
And early milk-carts' rattle.

All night the cock'rels, growing

In weary iterations,
While from the orphaned lambkins rise
Heart-rending lamentations.
All night the keepers rend the air
With tootling most unpleasant,
As Reynard they attempt to scare
From midnight, feasts of pheasant;
Anon the geese with piercing cries
Upraise a fearful riot,
As Reynard, sick of rabbit, tries
To get a change of diet.
All night I, sleepless, toss and ban
The everlasting Babel
Of senseless bird and beast and man
In wood and coop and stable;
All night upon my mattress hard
I curse the fancy silly
That lured my steps a single yard
From peaceful Piccadilly.
NO MORE.
The memory of those bygone days
Brings thoughts too sacred for
Expression in a studied phrase:
I can suggest—no more.
She whom I wildly idolized
Of years knew but a score.
I must confess I was surprised
To hear it was no more.
My love was far from idle sport,
Yet when I fiercely swore
To love but her—she cut me short,
And begged 1 'd say no more.
Saddest of hours I chose, I fear,
Out of the twenty-four.
I told her what I made per year,
Her glances said, "no more?"
I vowed to take my wretched life—
To drown in grief and gore;
I made my will, I bought a knife—
And then could do no more.
She gave her hand—her shapely hand-
To one she'd loved before,
Whom she soon taught, I understand,
To wish he were no more.

lived at Kilkee. Sark'h imagination,
kindled by thought of the grandeur of
the scenery on the rock-girdled coast;
tho sea in its many moods; sometimes a
boundless expanse of blue, sometimes, in
days of wrath, incessantly beating against

sets, and the stately ships going on to
their haven under the hill.
"You must live among some splendid
scenery," mused Sark.
"Scenery !" almost screamed the Irish
member. "Bedad! there's nothing but
wather between us and Ameriky."
Through a long day there was nothing
but water between us and Ameriky. The

miles, little more than one half. So a

a link of rail will connect Clarbeston
Road on the main lino with Letterston on
the way to Fishguard, cutting off some
miles. In three years the service will be
commenced, and a new route opened to
Ireland, bringing southern parts of the
distressful country nearer to London by
two hours and a half as compared with the
North Western route which now takes
the cake and the traffic. New Milford
will be forsaken, and Fishguard will be
even as the green bay tree.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 4, 1901.
MRS. MEDWIN.
By Henry James.
II.
Miss Cutter waited till she heard the house-door close; after
which, in a sightless, mechanical way, she moved about the room,
readjusting various objects that he had not touched. It was
as if his mere voice and accent had spoiled her form. But she
was not left too long to reckon with these things, for Mrs.
Medwin was promptly announced. This lady was not, more
than her hostess, in the first flush of her youth; her appearance
—the scattered remains of beauty manipulated by taste—re-
sembled one of the light repasts in which the fragments of
yesterday's dinner figure with a conscious ease that makes up
for the want of presence. She was perhaps of an effect still too
immediate to be called interesting; but she was candid, gentle
and surprised—not tatiguingly surprised, only just in the right
degree; and her white faee—it was too white—with the fixed
eyes, the somewhat touzled hair and the Louis Seize hat, might,
at the end of the very long neck, have suggested the head of a
princess carried, in a revolution, on a pike. She immediately
took up the business that had brought her—with the air, how-
over, of drawing from the omens then discernible less confi-
dence than she had hoped. The complication lay in the fact
that if it was Mamie's part to present the omens, that lady
yet had so to colour them as to make her own service large.
She perhaps over-coloured, for her friend gave way to momen-
tary despair.
"What you mean is, then, that it's simply impossible?"
"Oh, no," said Mamie, with a qualified emphasis. "It's
possible."
"But disgustingly difficult?"
"As difficult as you like."
"Then what can I do that I haven't done?"
"You can only wait a little longer."
"But that's just what I have done. I 've done nothing else.
I'm always waiting a little longer!"
Miss Cutter retained, in spite of this pathos, her grasp of
the subject. "The thing, as I've told you, is for you first
to be seen."
"But il people won't look at me?"
"They will."
"They will ?"—Mrs. Medwin was eager.
"They shall," her hostess went on. "It's their only having
heard—without having seen."
"But if they stare straight the other way?" Mrs. Medwin
continued to object. "You can't simply go up to them and
twist their heads about!"
"It's just what I can !" said Mamie Cutter.
But her charming visitor, heedless, for the moment, of this
attenuation, had found the way to put it. "It's the old story.
You can't go into the water till you swim; and you can't swim
till you go into the water. I can't be spoken to till 1 'm seen;
but I can't be seen till I'm spoken to."
She met this lucidity, Miss Cutter, with but an instant's
lapse. "You say I can't twist their heads about. But I have
twisted them."
It had been quietly produced, but it gave her companion
a jerk. "They say ' Yes '?"
She summed it up. "All but one. She says 'No.'"
Mrs. Medwin thought—then jumped. "Lady Wantridge?"
Miss Cutter—as more delicate—only bowed admission. "I
shall see her either this afternoon or late to-morrow. But she
has written."
Her visitor wondered again. "May I see her letter?"
"No." She spoke with decision. "But I shall square her."
"Then how?"
"Well,"—and Miss Cutter, as if looking upward for inspira-
tion, fixed her eyes awhile on the ceiling—" well, it will come
to me."
Mrs. Medwin j watched her—it was impressive. "And will
they come to you — the others?" This question drew out
the fact that they would—so far, at least, as they consisted of
Lady Edward, Lady Bellhouse and Mrs. Pounckr; who had
engaged to muster, at the signal of tea, on the 14th—prepared,
as it were, for the worst. There was, of course, always the
chance that Lady Wantridge might take the field in such force
as to paralyse them—though that danger, at the same time,
seemed inconsistent with her being squared. It didn't perhaps
all quite ideally hang together; but what it sufficiently oame
to was that if she was the one who could do most for a person
in Mrs. Medwin'S position she was also the one who could do
most against. It would therefore be distinctly what our friend
familiarly spoke of as "collar-work." The effect of these
mixed considerations was, at any rate, that Mamie eventually
acquiesced in the idea, handsomely thrown out by her client,
that she should have an "advance" to go on with. Miss
Cutter confessed that it seemed at times as if one scarce could
go on; but the advance was, in spite of this delicacy, still
more delicately made—made in the form of a banknote, several
sovereigns, some loose silver and two coppers, the whole
contents of her purse, neatly disposed by Mrs. Medwin on one
of the tiny tables. It seemed to clear the air for deeper
intimacies, the fruit of which was that Mamie, lonely, after all,
in her crowd, and always more helpful than helped, eventually
brought out that the way Scott had been going on was what
seemed momentarily to overshadow her own power to do so.
"I've had a descent from him." But she had to explain.
"My half-brother—Scott Homer. A wretch."
'' What kind of a wretch ?''
"Every kind. I lose sight of him at times—he disappears
abroad. But he always turns up again, worse than ever."
"Violent?"
"No."
"Maudlin?"
"No."
"Only unpleasant?"
"No. Rather pleasant. Awfully clever—awfully travelled
and easy."
"Then what's the matter with him?"
Mamie mused, hesitated—seemed to see a wide past. "I
don't know."
"Something in the background?" Then, as her friend was
silent, "Something queer about cards?" Mrs. Medwin threw
off.
"I don't know—and I don't want to!"
"Ah, well, I'm sure I don't," Mrs. Medwin returned with
spirit. The note of sharpness was perhaps also a little in the
observation she made as she gathered herself to go. "Do you
mind my saying something'!"
Mamie took lier eyes quickly from the money on the little
jtand. "You may say what you like."
"I only mean that anything awkward you may have to keep
out of the way does seem to mako,more wonderful, doesn't it,
that you should have got just where you are? 1 allude, you
know, to your position."
"I see." M iss Cutter somewhat coldly smiled. "To my
[tower."
"So awfully remarkable in an American!"
"Ah, you like us so."
Mrs. Medwin candidly considered. "JJut we don't, dearest."
Her companion's smile brightened. "Then why do you come
tome?"
"Oh, I like you //' Mrs. Medwin made out.
"Then that's it. There are no 'Americans.' It's always
'you.'"
"Me?" Mrs. Medwin looked lovely, but a little muddled.
"Me!" Mamie Cutter laughed. "But if you like me, you
dear thing, you can judge if I like you." She gave her a kiss
to dismiss her. "I '11 see you again when I've seen her."

"Lady Wantridgk? I hope so, indeed.
I '11 turn up late to-morrow, if you don't
catch me first. Has it come to you yet 1"
the visitor, now at the door, went on.
"No—but it will. There's time."
"Oh—a little less every day!"
Miss Cutter had approached the table,
and glanced again at the gold and silver
and the note—not, indeed, absolutely over-
looked the two coppers. "The balance,"
she put it, 'the day after ?''
"That very night if you like."
"Then count on me."
"Oh, if I didn't !" But the door
closed on the dark idea. Yearningly
then, and only when it had done so, Miss
Cotter took up the money.
She went out with it ten minutes later,
and, the calls on her time being many,
remained out so long that at half-past six
she had not come back. At that hour,
on the other hand, Scott Homer knocked
at her door, where her maid, who opened
it with a weak pretence of holding it firm,
ventured to announce to him, as a lesson
well learnt, that he had not been ex-
pected till seven. No lesson, none the
less, could prevail against his native art;
he pleaded fatigue, her—the maid's—
dreadful depressing London and the need
to curl up somewhere. If she would just
leave him quiet half-an-hour that old sofa
up-stairs would do for it; of which he
took, quickly, such effectual possession
that when five minutes later she peeped,
nervous for her broken vow, into the
drawing-room, the faithless young woman
found him extended at his length and
peacefully asleep.

EAILWAY COMPANIONS.
(By a Disagreeable Traveller.)
ii.
I have known people thoughtlessly
speak well of the luncheon-basket. In
my opinion, the luncheon-basket arouses
the worst passions of human nature, and
is a direct incentive to deeds of violence.
To say this is to cast an aspersion upon the
refreshment contractor, who is evidently
a man of touchingly simple faith and high
imagination. Simple faith assuredly, for
does he not provide on the principle that
our insides are hardy and vigorous and
unspoilt by the art of cooking? High
imagination most certainly, otherwise ho
would never call that red fluid by the
name of claret.
No, it is to the social rather than to the
gastronomic influence of the luncheon-
basket that I wish to advert.
Once I procured a luncheon-basket and
with it came the demon of discontent and
suspicion, converting three neutral people
into deadly enemies.
One was a pale young man who had
been scowling over Browning and making
frantic notes on the margin of the book.
Personally, I don't think it quite decent
for pale young men to improve their minds
in a public conveyance—but at any rate
he had seemed harmless. Now he raised
his eyes and viewed me with undisguised
contempt. "Wretched glutton," he said
in effect, and when accidentally I burned
my mouth with mustard (which a sudden
swerve had sent meandering in a yellow
stream across the chicken and ham), he
gave a sneering, callous smile, which
reminded me that a man may smile and
smile and be a—railway companion.
I verily believe that youth to be
capable of any crime, even Extension
lecturing.
Then there was a young lady reading a
sixpenny Braddon, who viewed me as if
I were some monster; when I shut my
eyes and gulped oft some—er—claret, she
brought biscuits and lemonade from a
small bag and l-efreshed herself with
ostentatious simplicity, as if to say,
"Look upon this picture and on the wine-
bibbing epicurean in the corner." An
old lady with her was more amply pro-
vided for (old ladies usually take more
care of their insides than anyone else in
creation), but although she munched
sandwiches, and washed them down with
sherry (probably sweet, ugh!) luxuriously,
she looked with pious horror at my plates
and dishes spread out. I might have said,
"Madam, I eat frankly and openly; my
resources may be viewed by all. Your
secret and delusive bags have limitless
resources that you are ashamed to show."
I didn't say so; but the restraint placed
on myself quite spoilt the lunch. No more
baskets.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 4, 1901.
"COURT AND CAMP."
(To be read without prejudice to ditto and
ditto under proper management.)
As an earnest, hard-working curate
(three Bazaars and a Jumble Sale during
the last six weeks !) I took charge of a
detachment of our local Lads' Brigade, at
their sea-side camp this year. How the
boys would glory in the hitherto unknown
ocean, and all the beauties of Nature!
And it should be my pleasing task to cul-
tivate their minds withal—to which end
I packed a small volume of poems, pub-
lished anonymously, but—ah, I suppose I
may as well confess it—they wore mine.
The Lads mustered in force, wearing
smart round caps and belts, and
looking like a cross between a
District Messenger and one of
the Army Service Corps—I, as
Commanding Officer, also wore
a belt, buckled round my black,
long-skirted coat, white sand-
shoes, and a Glengarry cap,
which gave me quite a military
appearance. Our baggage was
very limited; my own effects
being contained in a largo
biscuit tin and a cigar-box.
Directly we entrained, the
dear lads' spirits and love of
music began to assert them-
selves. Nearly all had brought
mouth-organs, andsoon we went
along merrily to the lilt of at
least twenty different tunes,
varied by hoorayings ad lib.
It was all so unaffectedly
hearty.
Arrived at Prawntown, our
Fife and Drum band was quickly
formed up, and with me at their
head, our drums banged and
our llfes shrieked through the
peaceful little village. 1 after-
wards heard that most of the
inhabitants fled fearfully out
into the surrounding country,
but noticed nothing at the time,
being too nearly stunned by
the big drum.
We reached the camp and soon
settled down. After our frugal meal—my
own consisting of two currant buns and a
bottle of ginger-beer—I approached an
intelligent youth to ask what had been
his impression of the vast, illimitable sea,
which had now gladdened his eyes for the
first time?
"Fust time be blowed 1" (So uncon-
ventional.) "1 bin daown 'ere hevery
year since the bloomin' camp's bin
opened. Wot do 1 think o' the sea?
Hoh, well, that's a bit of all right, s' long
as yer don't fall inter it."
"I trust you take in the beauties of
Nature?" 1 continued.
"Yus, I do that! You see me wen I
gits a chawuce at ole fatty Jones's apples!
—'is orchid's a-bustin' over with 'em.
But 'e keeps a dorg, that's the wust of it.
Larst year, wen I was shaikin' the tree,
'e nearly tore orl the close orf of me!"
Next morning the reveille sounded, and
I marched the lads down to bathe, stand-
ing well up to windward of their clot hing,
deposited in little heaps upon the shore.
What with yelling, horse-play, chiveying
a wretched terrier, and two fights, we had
not a dull moment.
After breakfast, they played cricket,
whilst I read one of my poems to a sick
lad. I am sorry to say that ho was much
sicker after the reading than he had been
before. Then 1 betook myself for a ramble
in the country lanes.

"THERE'S NOTHINC
HALF
YOUNC
SWEET
DREAM."
did not. Indeed, a more brutal person
than the Chairman of the Bench I never
met.
I appeared wearing my belt and Glen-
garry cap, and was at once made to take
off the latter by the Gaoler. The Chair-
man stared at mo and asked, "What is
this?"
1 blushingly explained, and he went on:
"Are you the head of this camp?"
I proudly replied that I commanded
these lads.
"Or they command you? Which is it?"
he asked sarcastically.
Wretched man!
Then, the case being proved, this
unsympathetic creature gave his decision.
"Fined five shillings each
and costs. And I take this
opportunity of saying that the
worthy young gentleman "—
(myself) — "who thinks he
'commands' this camp, is about
as fitted for the task as an
ostrich is to climb trees. Since
the arrival of these boys, a reign
of terror has existed. They
break into orchards, steal fruit,
destroy fences, bathe in pro-
hibited places, bawl in the
streets, fight with each other,
and now fl ve of them stand con-
victed of wanton destruction.
The inhabitants of this once
peaceful.spot will feel that it
is no place for them any longer.
Most of them have already
fled in despair, lodging-house
keepers see ruin staring them
in the face, whilst the residents
have barred and shuttered their
doors and windows. And all
because this amiable gentle-
man entirely fails to keep his
charges in order. His conduct
should be at once investigated
by his Bishop—or his Mamma."
I left the Court—and later
in the day, the Camp.
TlMPKINS,

AFTER MANY TEARS OF WA.NDERINQ THE WORLD Oil,
LONQ-FELT DESIRE TO RETURN TO THE HALLOWED SPOT
WHERE HE WAS REFUSED BY HIS FIRST AND ONLY LOVE.
All went well until the fourth day. The
lads, with their mouth-organs and their
yellings, were rapidly emptying an over-
crowded locality and getting the place
almost entirely to themselves. But the
catastrophe was at hand.
That day, some of the boys playfully
raided the peach-house and destroyed
the grape-vines of Sir Haughtybird
Humpleby, and the latter, instead of
treating the matter as a harmless joke,
promptly called a constable and "ran in"
the offenders.
I had to bail them out and produce
them in Court next morning.
I thought my explanation would at once
settle this disagreeable business; but it

Officer. "Well, mv man, what is your religion?"
Man. "I dunno, Sir."
Officer. "Come, come! What church do you attend—Church of England, Roman-
Catholic or Nonconformist?"
Man. "Please, Sir, I follers the Band!"
IN TWO PLAY-HOUSES.
A. Page from our Impressionist's Note-Book.
Becky Sharp! At the Prince of Wales's
Theatre. Yes, a part of her and the
pleasanter part. The wit, the fun, the
good nature. But the darker side absent.
Scarcely a suggestion of the heartless,
thoroughly and entirely wicked woman.
"I am innocent!" justified. Not quite
Thackeray, but very good play acting.
Miss Marie Tempest to be congratulated.
Raxvdon Crawley, Mr. Leonard Boyne,
excellent. Everyone has his own ideal,
and perhaps the Rawdon Crawley of
Mr. Leonard Boyxe is not the ideal of
everyone. But it would be difficult for
anyone to suggest an improvement.
Heavy cavalry man, gambler, but, to use
the slang of the day, "good sort."
Magnificent in the supper scene. Mr.
Gilbert Hare not quite the Marquis of
Steyne. Very near, but not quite. A
trifle too old. A little angular, and
TnACKERAY's Marquis was rounded. Diffi-
cult again to suggest improvement. A
fine performance, worthy of his father's
son. Version? Well, not bad. On the
whole a good play. Rather absurd the
Earl's courtship. Meets Becky in Act
II., and then a number of years pass.
Under the circumstances the incidents
of the last scene a little late. But taken
all round—considering that scenery and
dresses are first-rate—good play, well
worth seeing. Final objection, interior
of sponging-house a little too gorgeous.
Less of the second-rate palace and more
of the fifth-rate coffee-house would have
been better. But on the whole, I repeat,
good play, well worth seeing.
A Man of his Word. At Mrs.
Lanotry's truly beautiful Imperial
Theatre. Rather forced idea of honour.
Officer and gentleman, believing himself
to be dying, confesses that ho did not
perform an act usually rewarded with the
Victoria Cross. Induces his dearest friend
to promise never to tell. Dearest friend
doesn't tell, and gets into a scrape in con-
sequence. Believed to have missed the
Victoria Cross himself. Senior Failure for
the Victoria Cross recovers, and is ordered
to take command of the Army somewhere in
the North-West Provinces, because (to put
it in mess-room form) " he's about the only
Johnnie who knows how to win the
battle, don't you know." Matter, re-
motely connected with the Victoria Cross,
hushed up in consequence of national
importance of the programme. E.rit
Senior Failure for the Victoria Cross,
promising—in a vague kind of way—that
after he has won the battle he will
disappear for ever. Probably change
his name, shave off his moustache and
become a millionaire or something of that
sort. Still, amusing piece. Mr. Herbert
Waring, admirable as dearest friend of
the Senior Failure for the Victoria Cross.
Mr. H. B. Irving, as Senior Failure, also
capital. Mrs. Cecil Raleigh, as a lady
who seems anxious to act as a guide to a
personally-conducted party to the High
Court of Justice, Probate, Divorce and
Admiralty Division, also most pleas-
ing. Character rather curious specimen
of society at Simla.
Play judiciously stage-managed, but
rather a pity that some one from H. Q. S.
was not asked to look in to inspect mili-
tary details. In the absence of that
individual, and acting as his unwilling
substitute, I venture to hint that some of
the officers should not have been passed
their drill until they had learned how to
close their fingers in saluting. Divided
opinion, too, about the wearing of sword
knots. Fancy that C.R.A. in the last act
would have had sufficient service to have
known that his sword knot was wrong—
think it would have attracted unfavour-
able attention at an official inspection.
And why levee dress for dinner or five
o'clock tea? Of course, the entire garri-
son twiy have been lunching in state with
the Viceroy, but, in spite of this sugges-
tion, the levee dress—although distinctly
effective, was scarcely convincing. Yet
these are very minor details. A Man of
his Word, a very good play very well
acted. Seems to bo a success. Success
deserved.
According to the Daily Telegraph, the
French Police, in view of the Czar's visit,
"are actively looking for Anarchists at
Dunkirk," and in the same column a
quotation from the Francais, dated from
the port which Charles the Second sold,
announces that " well-known Nihilists and
persons reported to be dangerous Anar-
chists have for several days been missing
from their usual places of residence."
Mr. Punch, without pretending to be a
Sherlock Holmes, would respectfully
suggest that "the well-known &c." may
have crossed the Channel.

On European monarchs' tracks shall go,
And find in Denmark's company of kings
Poor substitutes for Leicester's King and Coe.

And marvel how the Duke of Cornwall likes
To wear a third-class County's name and lose
The lonely lustre streaming from the Tykes.

HYDE PARK AND THE FALRY.
(A Holiday Fancy.)
It began with the rainbow. Stretched on brown turf I had
watched the slate-coloured sky illuminated on a sudden by
a wealth of colouring which suggested that the clerk of the
weather was—with all his shortcomings—a man of true artistic
feeling. Tho ground on which I was lolling was scarcely
touched by the recent shower, for a friendly old elm spread
his protecting arms above me. Evidently the rainbow had
exercised an exhilarating effect upon him, for a handful of dry
leaves pattered on to my upturned face. I captured one of
these, and was idly pulling it to pieces when a tiny voice at
my elbow said:
"You needn't destroy fairy correspondence."
"I beg your pardon," I said, turning round.
A tiny elf was perched upon a tuft of cornflowers a few paces
from me.
"You know very well," continued a voice like the purling
of a brook, "that we send messages to one another on the
leaves. At least you used to know it once when you tried to
read our marks and symbols in that old Surrey garden."
"That was such a long time ago," I observed lamely. "You
see I was very small then, and so much has happened since.
But how is it you are here, of all places. Surely those quaint
old gardens and woods"
The blue eyes gleamed till the cornflowers paled with envy.
"There are plenty of children who want us. Perhaps you
thought we ceased to exist when you forgot to look for us."
"Not at all," I said, with the uncomfortable feeling that my
thoughts had been read. "These children, however," I added
hastily, in order to turn the conversation from a personal
channel, "will scarcely appreciate your kind attentions."
"You 're far, far more stupid than you used to be," said the
fairy, reflectively; "like all grown-up people — especially
men!" She looked wistfully at the scattered bands of grubby,
yelling, Cockney children playing about.
"When you were a sensible little boy," she resumed, "you
found us because you wanted us. These children want us far
more than you did — although they may not know how to
express it. Every child is not brought up luxuriously on Hans
Anof.RSEN." (She looked severely at me.) "But we can read in
their eyes and their wistful mouths that they want us.
Why, every London park is full of fairies now."
The journalistic instinct rose within me. I had visions of an
article, "Interview with a Fairy: an Elf's Opinion of the
London School Board," etc. At that moment a small girl of six
created a diversion by rushing across the grass close by and
climbing over prohibitive railings into a sacred, ringed-off por-
tion of ground. She was hunting after a ball she had lost. A
severe-looking park-keeper came up from the opposite direction.
Instantly the fairy swung off her perch, and just as the keeper
passed she threw two stray sunbeams into his eyes. This so
dazzled him that he didn't note the trespasser who had paused
in terror. Then another sunbeam was flung in the direction of
the ball, and the next minute the child was racing away with
the recovered treasure.
"Capital," I said
"Eh?" said the park-keeper, looking down.
"I wasn't speaking to you," I explained, then looked around
me. The fairy had gone. But I realised that there were more
things in a London park than are dreamt of in a park-keeper's—
or, for the matter of that, a journalist's—philosophy.

TIIE CRUISE OF THE SABRTNA.
II.—A Circular Tour.
Extracts from tiie Travel Diary of
Tory, M.P.
Miljord Haven, Tuesday.—Wasn't there
somcono who wrote a treatise on The
Hunting of the Staff? Or was it The
Tracking of the Snark? Fancy it was the
former. Anyhow, we 've spent a fair
summer day in hunting for the Staff.
Game peculiar to single line railways
worked on the block system. Idea—very
reasonable—is that if you have only one
train at a time on a particular section of
the line, you can't possibly have a colli-
sion. Argal, the guard of a train passing
through station A is handed something
like a policeman's truncheon which he
delivers up on passing station B. Till the
Staff comes back to station A no train
may follow on track of train number one.
"Very well," as William Allan says
when explaining to the House the fear-
some potentialities of the Belleville
Boiler.
Our intent was to make our way from
Milford Haven to Fishguard on the
northern coast of the peninsula that
flanks the entrance to the Bristol Chan-
nel. If we had taken the ordinary train all
would have been well. But none of your
ordinary trains for the Commodore, Bart.
Like Todgers, he "can do it when he
likes," and he always likes. Must have
a special train, and such a specialler!
Only a saloon carriage; but the floor was
carpeted with rugs from far-off Ind;
the cushions on the seats were of faint
sea-green morocco; the silken curtains
looped across the windows were of the
same tint. A silver lamp swung over a
table at which eight could comfortably
sit at luncheon. From a corner peeped a
lordly hamper.
"Something iced," said the Commodore
in reply to the Member for Sark's mute
enquiring glance.
Capital start this. Run across from
coast to coast in hour and a half. High
noon now. Lunch at 1.30. Meal at hotel
ordered by telegraph. "And lobsters,"
the Commodore, with his own hand, added
to the simple suggestions of Sark, who
drafted the telegram. Trundled merrily
out of the station; passed in triumph
through Tenby; reached Saundersfoot,
and the discovery that life is not all silk
curtains, silver lamps and Eastern rugs.
As at a critical point in his career,
Grandolph "forgot Goschen" so we had
forgotten the Staff, and all it implies.
The Staff had gone on with the ordinary
train to Whitland, and till it was brought
back by down train we couldn't stir a
foot—"not a Saundersfoot" as the Com-
modore gloomily said.
Half-an-hour sped. In somo circum-
stances Saundersfoot may have its attrac-
tions for the intelligent wayfarer. Under

AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE FROM COLORADO.

the midday sun, with luncheon already
postponed, they were not apparent
through the plate-glass -windows of our
luxuriant carriage. Ten minutes later
down train arrived. Our guard seized
the magic Staff; put on steam for
Clynderwen; not so bad after all; a
cold lunch was ordered; in this weather
couldn't get much colder for half-an-
hour's wait.
Clynderwen the junction with the main
line and the single line going on to
Fishguard. Do the rest of the run in
half-an-hour.
"Very sorry, Sir, indeed, but the Staff
just gone on. Back in fifty minutes."
'Twas the voice of the station-master.
Blank silence fell on the company.
Began to regard the Commodore with
estranging glance. What did he mean
by taking us out to Barmecide feasts in
luxurious equipages? "And lobsters,"
forsooth! If he had been content "with
the ordinary train (return tickets at
considerable reduction in price) all would
have been well. Instead of which, as the
judge said, he goes about the country in
purple and fine linen, pulling up for fifty
minutes at every other roadside station.
This last block, if nothing worse
happened, would bring us to Fishguard
at three o'clock, a little late for lobsters.
Besides, who knows where the confounded
Staff would be when we arrived at the
next boundary of a section?
'' I really think,'' said the Commodore, in
ft meek voice quite unfamiliar, what time
his gaiters twinkled on his own quarter-
deck, "we'd better not go on. Mightn't
reach Fishguard till four o'clock, that
would be—don't you think—eh? We're
on the main line now, where the Staff I
doesn't count. If we keep on we shall get I
to Milford Haven by three o'clock, and can
have a snack on the yacht."
"Milford Haven, Sir!" exclaimed Sark,
with irritating access of politeness. "Isn't
that the place we started from at noon?"
"Well, yes," said the Baronite, apolo-
getically. "But, you know, we must
start from somewhere ; everybody does."
So we steered W.S.W. by south, reach-
ing Milford Haven at 3.15, hot and hungry.
"Je n'ai pas vu Carcasonne," wails the
dying man in the plaintive Gascon ballad.
We did not see Fishguard.
This melancholy and true story should
be illustrated by a map after the manner
of Treasure Island. Failing that, look up
the map in the railway guide of the Great
Western Co. and you '11 find our circular
tour appropriately marked in blood-red-
line.

he anything like Dean Simpkin?
Little Daughter. Oh, no, daddy! Be-

of braces would do you good.
Vicar. A pair of braces! It surely
couldn't have been the Bishop.
Little Daughter. No, daddy; he said he

and here are the braces.

LIVES OP GREAT MEN.
No. II.—The Duke op Donnybrook and Bow.
The fifteenth Duke of Donnybrook and Bow-
It is a splendid and an ancient title—
Felt that life's lamp was sinking very low,
Leaving but little of the spark called vital.
His sins—nay, let us speak of them as errors—
Were few; for such a Duke death has no terrors.
He was a good old man; not overwise,
But Dukes require no ample store of wisdom;
Dulness had no disfavour in his eyes,
And dull men loved him, for he never quizzed 'em.
He was no wit—in fact, I don't know whether
It's right to mention Dukes and wit together.
Yet he was great: he won the Derby race
First with a chestnut, next time with a bay gee.
In every Cabinet he had a place,
And so they made him G.C.B. and K.G.
In every English county he had got land;
He owned a river and a moor in Scotland.
All other things he had his rank to suit:
Cedars and oaks his spacious gardens grew in;
Much glass he owned for orchids and for fruit—
Possessed five castles and a hoary ruin.
Pictures and prints—I scarce know how to tell 'em—■
And busts and arms and folios bound in vellum.
That death should take this man appears to me
A most un-English and pro-Boer proceeding.
To cut the flowers and let the coarse stuff be
Is, you'll agree with me, unskilful weeding.
It needs a lot of pretty hard forgiving
To take a Duke and leave a pauper living.
Such pleas availed not, as the hour drew nigh,
To check the purposo of the grizzly spectre.
The Duke, good soul, resigned himself to die,
Sustained, consoled, encouraged by the Rector,
Who held a Ducal living and was trying
To do his best to help the Ducal dying.
So the Duke died, and all men praised him well
(Some praised too much, but nobody rebuked 'em);
But, which was strange, no man of tbem could tell
Who should succeed the dead Duke in the Dukedom.
Much to the British public's consternation,
The Duke, it seemed, had left no male relation.
Three brothers he had had, but one
In infancy departed.
His breath was short, his race was run
Almost before he started.
The second might have travelled far,
And might have died in bed, Sir.
One day he bought a motor-car;
The next day he was dead, Sir.
The third one (of a City man
He seemed to have the makings)
In manhood's prime set out to plan
Commercial undertakings.
The City was his hunting ground:
In many a bright prospectus
On which his Lordship's name was found
He offered to direct us.
Withal, the man was never rash,
For, ere the wise foreboded
Or even hinted at a crash,
He skilfully unloaded.
He floated out his companies,
But when there came a gale, or
When clouds were black, finance's seas
Knew no more careful sailor.
If storms arose he judged it best,
Unless they could be weathered,
To make for home ; he had a nest
Most comfortably feathered.
But how shall man foretell his end?
His companies outgrew him,
And one declared a dividend—
The shock was such it slew him.

TORTURE-CHAMBER MUSIC.
[" The French Academie de Medecine has been much excited over a
new dental apparatus which combines the administration of gas with
phonographic musical selections. While you are inhaling the one, you are
likewise drinking in the other, and the result is said to be ' a most agree-
able sensation.'"—Lady's Pictorial.]
Scene—A Modern Torture-Chamber, i.e., the Operating-room
of a Dentist. In a prominent position before the windoiv
stands a "roomy" chair fitted with mechanism for adjtist-
ing same. Overhanging it is a movable case of implements
of the most dis- and ex-tracting kind. Near by is a formidable
apparatus exhaling a gaseous odour for administering an
anatsthesia, to it is attached a phonograph, contiguous to
which latter is an enormous array of boxes filled with wax
cylinders containing "tunes." A shadowy assistant flits
to and fro, appearing and disappearing with alarming
frequency and mystery, rising and falling in clouds of
odoform. The Dentist is wiping a particularly aggressive-
looking instrument when a stout and elderly lady enters.
Her face is so swollen she cannot speak.
Dentist. Good morning! (Referring to visiting-book as he
waves elderly sufferer to the chair.) Ah I (Apparently satisfied
that the lady is not there under false pretences, proceeds to
gaze upon her disfigurement with a cheerful smile.) An abscess,
ma'am. I'm afraid we shall have to dispense with the services
of that gentleman (forcing Elderly Lady's mouth open and play-
fully tapping offending "gentleman " with forceps. Elderly Lady
winces and throws up a pair of remonstrating Hands). Please,
don't be alarmed. We will take it out, I think, under gas.
Painless. Absolutely, I assure you, and not unpleasant.
(Elderly Lady's face, if capable of expression, would facially
"beg to differ." Dentist signals violently to Shadowy Assistant,
who is energetically engaged in looking the other way; having at
length made him appreciate the fact that the Elderly Lady is
about to have "gas," he proceeds to make the necessary pre-
parations.) It is usual, Madam—(with great confidence and
professional aplomb)—to make these operations as agreeable
as possible. I propose to lull you into a rapturous repose.
(Sweeps his hands slowly before Elderly Lady's face, suggesting,
in a general way, the enchantment of the process.) You will
fall asleep on " a dying air." (Elderly Lady attempts to rise.
Adjusting the chair to an almost horizontal position.) Pray be
calm, Madam. A quotation merely, Shakspeare. I mean a
musical air, as you shall see—or hear. (Laying a hand affec-
tionately on plwnograph.) Attached to the apparatus is this
phonograph, which will be set in motion at the same time as
the gas is administered. You will float away—metaphorically
—to the sound of soft music. (Elderly Lady is much impressed.)
Now, I should be so obliged if you could give me some idea of
the kind of music you would like to go off to. (Happily.) Shall
it be a spirited mazurka, reminiscent of happy girlhood's
days? (Elderly Lady signifies disapproval by gurgle.) Then a
dreamy waltz? We have all the latest, and I must say the
delirium of some of our modern waltzes has a most spirit-
wafting effect. Lift you [out offyourself. (Elderly Lady shows

great aversion to waltz - music.) No?
Then a patriotic song or a soft solo
from one of our comic operas? (Elderly
Lady suggests by muffled interjections that
it would be most inappropriate. It is any-
thingbut a comic opera-tion.) True. Well,
shall we say a nocturne? Something from
the divine Chopin? {Elderly Lady franti-
cally signals to dentist to extract tooth, and
becomes exhausted.) Then, Madam, I'm
sure Wagner is to your taste. Quite a
run on Tannhduser for back teeth, while
the "Wedding March" from Lohengrin is
a safe " molar " accompaniment. (Elderly
Lady stares blankly at Dentist, who takes
silence for consent and proceeds with
operation to the tune of:
"You may wriggle, yon may struggle, but I've got
him in my eye,
And I'll have him, yes, I'll have him, I will have
him by-and-by I"
an air from "Faust-up-to-Vate " which the
Shadowy Assistant slips in by mistake.)
Same Scene. (Tmo hours later.)
A slim, clean-shaven young man, with glasses
and what is termed an "artistic" get-
up, rises in an excited state from the
chair. Oas having been just ad-
ministered and a tooth drawn, to the
tune of "The Absent-Minded Beggar."
8. Y. M. (as furiously as the exluiusted
state in which the gas has left him will
allow, to Dentist, who smiles in amiable
discomfort). You more than fool! You
Philistine! To rob me of a sound tooth.
I particularly pointed out the tooth I
■wanted extracted. (Dentist suggests choice
was prompted by decay). Nonsense! Rot!
It was the other one, two teeth off. But
that's a small matter. It's not the tooth
I grudge. But I'm a musician, and to be
forced to experience one of the most
deliciously languishing sensations to that
execrable tune! It's atrocious, it's
degrading! An insult to my artistic
instinct, an outrage against my delicately
constituted organisation. It has left me
with impressions that it will take weeks
to obliterate. If you had only let me go
off to Thohaikowsky's Last Symphony! I
would have forgiven a trifling mistake.
Even Mendelssohn, or a Ritournelle by
Madame Chaminade. I could have borne
the loss of a few teeth under such circum-
stances. But the "Absent"

THE CALENDAR OF LOVE.
I knew a little maid in January,
She was so sweet and wary,
But not the little maid I knew
In February;
I knew that little maid in March,
All frills and furbelows and starch,
But when in April storm and shine
(A different sort of weather)
I thought the little maid was mine,
And we together!
I knew that little maid in May,
When blossoms were a-showing,
She grew more proud from day to day
When June with life was flowing.
Then came July, and she and I
Had quite a tender tether:
What mattered storm or cloudy sky ?—
We were together 1
Then August brought the bloom to come,
With fruit both rich and mellow;
September made the Harvest Home,
With fields of cornstalks yellow;
October—then she showed her pride,
November made her slither,
December showed I was denied—
We are no more together.
But still I love her, time or tide,
And hope for better weather!

SEPTEMBER SONG.
Tis the season of unreason; it were treason
To write sense.
In September, pray remember, silly songs are
No offence.
If you 're clever now you never will endeavour
To be wise,
But be frivolously jolly, catching folly
As it flies.
Now we weary with our dreary, silly query
Every print;
Not forgetting to be setting social problems
Without stint.
Now the scaly serpent daily do we gaily
Renovate,
On his visit in a solemn open column
We dilate.
Lass and lad, see, ma and dad, see, from the sad sea
Come at last,
For the summer has become a happy mem'ry
Of the past.
Now we tumble with a grumble to our humble
Business ways.
As we dream in manner hazy of our lazy
Holidays.
Maids alluring are enduring now the curing
Homburg yields.
Now the partridge with a cartridge seeks the sportsman
O'er the fields.
Now the clubby, fresh and chubby (trifle tubby)
City he
Doth in triumph romp and royster with the oyster
From the sea!
A TEN DAYS' TRIP.
Aboard the "Orlando." 1.30. Already quite a nautical appe-
tite. Steward places us. My next neighbour and boon com-
panion is Charlie Wortler, an old friend and distinguished
actor (though Wortler is not his nom de thi&tre), whom I have
not seen for years. Delighted, both of us; and, in a second,
we are, as it were, Siamese twins; at all events, we are to-
gether bound for the same port, on the same voyage—but not,
of course, in a twin-ship.
Captain also delighted at our knowing each other. But was
there ever such a captain 1 Why, on his personal introduction as
host and master of the ceremonies aboard ship, we all, every
man Jack of us, and every woman Jil of us, become intimately
acquainted, nay, on the very best possible terms with one
another within the first twenty minutes of dinner-time. This
fraternal sentiment commences at our table which, tem-
porarily, is the Captain's, and communicates itself rapidly to
the entire party occupying the several tables in the dining
saloon, for the Wilson Liner is choke-full and not a cabin to
spare. With most courteous diplomacy, our Captain does not
stick to one table and isolate a small party, as if by favouritism,
but he takes the chair, as it were, at various meetings—now at
one mess, now at another—of his constituents, who, to a man or
woman, will at the end of the voyage all plump for Captain
Cowlrick, and would vote solid for making him Admiral of
the Fleet, but for the fact that thereby they would lose, not
only his cheery companionship, but his tried and experienced
seamanship on this Tilbury to Norway voyage.
If it be fine weather, our Captain points out the pleasures of
the trip, and expatiates on all the manifest advantages of
travelling by sea. He is the first to set the passengers amus-
ing themselves with "deck quoits," with "deck croquet" (a
most ingenious game), and with "deck" anything else that
offers opportunities for exercise or that affords diversion. If
there boa " nasty sea on" and ladies are collapsing, is not our
Captain at hand to see them well and comfortably bestowed,
and to restore courage to the most nervous by pointing out,
clearly and sensibly, how there could not possibly be any
danger, as, if there wore, could he, as Captain, be attending
to them? Would ho not have to be "above," like the sweet
little cherub in the old nautical song "perched " (as a cherub
might be, being in a general way physically incapacitated for
either sitting or standing—but not so our Captain) "up
aloft, keeping watch for the life of poor JACK," that is (in the
Captain's case), for the safety of the ship and those committed
to his charge? Certainly he would; and that common-
sense reasoning is the most efficacious remedy for the nerves
at sea.
So the Captain is a capital doctor for mal-de-mer, and those
who imagine themselves at their worst would be simply hope-
less but for his considerate and tactful treatment. Bravo,
Captain Cowlrick, who, when we are "all at sea," makes
every one of us feel "quite at home." Let us all chorus, as
years ago they did in Black Eye'd Susan Burlesque, only substi-
tuting Cowlrick for Crosstree, to the once familiar air of
"Champagne Charlie." "Captain Cowlrick is my name (Ms),
Good for any game to-night, my boys (bis), Then, bravo, boys,
off again to sea!"
Very hot August day, but comparatively cool, with gentle
breeze, as, post-prandially, we sit about on deck, reading,
chatting and idling generally, with occasional doze. Universal
opinion nautically expressed, that, in lovely weather, on a per-
fectly calm sea, and with land still clearly in view, there is
nothing like a sea trip, absolutely nothing to compare with it
for real tenjoyment!
Also there is nothing like companionship aboard, on a sea
voyage, to bring out the real genuine man or woman, no matter
what his or her profession or business may be when on shore.
Here is WORTLER, a melodramatic actor of either the brightest
or the deepest dye, according to the part for which he may have
been cast. Rarely have I seen him on the boards otherwise
than as a gallant rescuer of heroines, a champion of virtue, a
man who redeems a vicious past by one act of heroic self renun-
ciation, uniting the lovers' hands over his breast and dying to
slow music as the final curtain descends, or, occasionally, as a
polite villain of the modern school, with a self-possessed manner
and a handy pistol in his trousers pocket, and once as such
an awful type of humanity degraded By drunkenness that the
representation brought tears to the eyes of all and caused such
dryness of throats (through emotion) as could only be relieved
by the longest, deepest, and most cooling draughts imme-
diately that exceptionally thrilling performance was over,—
and here he is, in propria persona, "merry and free" (as that
atrocious gay scoundrel, Jack Sheppard, used to describe him-
self in his old song) and about as jolly as the jolliest of sand-
boys, whatever a " sandboy " may be—as long as he remains the
accepted nautical type of joviality.
Be the voyageur a barrister, statesman, actor, author, clergy-
man, doctor, no matter what, there is such a briny breeziness
about a sea-voyage that it takes off every particle of pro-
fessional veneer, blows away all conventional cobwebbiness,
and men and women en voyage appear, perhaps for the first
time in their lives, as what they really are, as what Nature
originally intended them to be, and shows them all, with very,
very few exceptions, to be just about "as good as they make
'em"—that is, generally, honest specimens of kindly humanity.
Aye! and even in their suffering! For suffering is "the badge
of" nearly "all the tribe" that go down to the sea in ships and
attempt to take their pleasure in the decidedly "deep," not to
say treacherous, waters.
Here is Wortler, on the very first evening, delighting us
with some recitations, having been pressed thereto by others

[The Sandal craze ma}- be the beginning of a great change in the matter of dress.]
•who, captain included and taking the lead, have all been doing
their levol best to make the time pass pleasantly. And the
next evening where is Wortler, "where is he?" Wrapped
up, bedless, supperless, drinkless, swathed in rugs, lying in
a sort of gutter on the upper deck, refusing to bo comforted,
and only murmuring polite but almost inarticulate regrets as
to the impossibility of his accepting any invitation to take
light refreshment "down below," being at that particular
moment otherwise engaged. But that was an evening and a
night when, with a few fortunate exceptions (not including
Waostaff, who, after being ultra-marine and affecting to play
the sailor, has every old joke and every possibility of a joke
taken out of him), all landsmen and landswomen on board
were either quite overcome by mal-dc-mer, or nervously over-
cautious, deciding upon not "going down to avoid" [as the
pugilists have it] the probable unpleasant consequences of what
a composer might describe as "a movement in C." Yet once
the storm over, all are alive again! Then, as evening advances,
and calm sea and rest and dinner restore us, the guests,
like the blackbirds in the opened pie, "began to sing," and
long before our arrival at Christiunsand we are, one and all of
us, " a pretty dish to set before a " Viking.
Gradually (1 am referring to the first night and not to that
of the storm), the music being over and the National Anthem
chorussed by the entire company (upon the principle of each
one for himself, and God save the King for us all), wo retire,
one by one, to our cabins in order to give ourselves, indi-
vidually, plenty of time for so arranging our compartments
(some eight or ten feet high, and five or six broad) as to
resemble, as nearly as may be, our own spacious bed and
dressing rooms at home. The door of my cabin is partially
open, and the port-hole open also: a delightful current of air.
Curling myself round somewhat after the manner of a tired dog
making himself comfortable on a hearthrug before the fire, I,
so to speak, worm myself into the "bunk" (why "bunk"?)
and cautiously stretch out my legs as I mentally measure the
space at command, and accommodate the coverlet, sheets, and
blanket to my straitened circumstances.
After taking a half turn, so to put it nautically, to star-
board and remaining there on trial. I execute another equally
cautious, and, as it would be called in music, "slow move-
ment" to larboard side. (" Larboard it is "—or, if it isn't, let
me be corrected by those who know better.) Having decided
on the advantages of this position I begin to pay attention to
my going to sleep, and now for the first time I become aware
of the wonderful power of the screw. It is like the heart
of the ship, pulsating quickly, unceasingly, loudly, but with
a decidedly healthy action. Its healthiness is encouraging.
But will it not, like Macbeth's crime, "murder sleep"? I
begin to read in order to distract my attention from the screw
and to induce sleep. I will not mention the name of the book,
as to do so, under the circumstances, might bo deemed uncom-
plimentary to the author. However, whether I became deeply
interested and began to meditate, or whether the monotony of
the thudding exercised a soothing effect on my nerves, I
suddenly found myself dozing, when, seizing the opportunity,
and always preternaturally cautious as to making any sudden
movement which should hopelessly muddle the bunk-coverings
for the night, I stretch my hand towards the electric button,
turn it, " put out the light, and then"—slowly and very gin-
gerly withdraw myself into my little lair, as if I were some
fugitive hiding from the minions of a cruel tyrant, and, once
more neatly and quietly folding myself up and laying myself out,
like a suit of flannels, on a shelf in a store cupboard, I am very
soon sound asleep. Not absolutely without rocking, but the
rocking is of the gentlest possible "hushabye-baby" descrip-
tion, so that this child of nature feels quite at "home on the
rolling deep, where the scattered waters" do something or
other, I forget what it was in the old song, "and the winds
their revels keep." Revels or no revels, the winds do not
disturb me, and I do not open my eyes again until 5 a.m. on a
glorious Sunday morning.

DOWN FOR?"
THE PLAYS OF SHAWKSPEAItE.
No I.—McBeth.
Readers of Caesar and Cleopatra may
remember that Mr. George Bernard Shaw
is at some pains to justify himself in a
preface for writing a drama dealing with
characters already used by Shakspeare.
He maintains that the intelligent Jplay-
goer, however much ho may admire
Shakspeare, may reasonably desire, as
time goes on, to see his plots and charac-
ters rehandled in the light of modern
ideas. Sated with Shakspeare, in fact,
he clamours for Shawkspeare. The
tragedy of Macbeth is a crucial instance
of the need for such revision. The deplor-
able lack of any trace of Scots idiom
must entirely prevent it from being ac-
cepted as a realistic picture of the events
it purports to recall. In the Shawk-
spearian version this defect has, it is
hoped, been successfully overcome, while
the five acts have been successfully com-
pressed into two.
ACT I.—SCENE—Glamis Castle. McBeth,
who, it will be remembered, was Thane
of Glamis, is discovered sitting by the
fire in the great hall with a glass of
whisky and water at his elbow. It is
nearly midnight. Enter Lady McBeth.
AfcB. Hoots, wife, are ye noe abed yet?
Lady Af. 'Tis noe likely wi' Dooncan an
a' ben the house.
AfcB. Eh, woman, ye 're jist pufflt up
wi' pride to hae the King o' Scotlan' to
stop wi' ye.
Lady M. Aweel, 'tis a great honour.
AfcB. Ay, an' verra expeensive. Will
he gang the morrow, d'ye ken?
Lady Af. {darkly). I hope noe to see that
morrow, guidmon.
AfcB. (talcing some more whisky). Eh,
wife, yer face is as a buke whaur mon
may read strange matters.
Lady Af. 'Tis -werra like.
AfcB. At the same time I dinna ken
why ye should noe wish to see him gane.
'Tis aye wastefu' to hae veesitors.
Lady Af. (impatiently). Mon, mon, ye're
nae better than a fule. What did the
Weird Seesters say to ye when ye met
them?
AfcB. They askit me for twa shillin'.
Lady Af. And when ye gied it to them?
AfcB. They said I wad be Thane o'
Cawdor an' King o' Scotlan'.
Lady Af. Aweel, are ye noe Thane o'
Cawdor?
AfcB. Ay, syn that puir body, Cawdor,
lost his head through takin' the wrang
side in the war wi' Narroway.
Lady Af. And wad ye noe like to be
King o' Scotlan'?
AfcB. (wavering). 'Tis a gran' poseetion.
Lady Af. Ye shall hae it, guidmon! Ye
shall hae it!
AfcB. (shaking his head). Woman, woman,
I'm thinkin' ye 're too ambeetious.
Lady Af. (contemptuously). Are ye
afeard?
AfcB. Nae, nae, I'm noe afeard. But
I'm noe sae rash either.
Lady Af. (still unappeased). Eh, mon,
ye 're a gey speeritless body. Ye '11 be
lettin' "I daur na" wait upon "I wad,"
like the puir bit pussie in the story-
buke.
AfcB. (sulkily). I've as muckle courage
as my neighbours.
Lady Af. Then ye've a gran* gift for
concealin' it.
AfcB. What wad ye hae me do? I
canna murder Dooncan. 'Twad be maist
inhospitable.
Lady Af. 'Twill noe be ne3essary.
(Solemnly.) Do ye ken whaur Dooncan
sleeps the nicht?
AfcB. Nae.
Lady Af. (triumphantly). In the haunted
chamber.
AfcB. (alarmed). The haunted chamber?
Hecht, woman, His Meejesty will noe like
that.
Lady Af. Mon, mon, whaur hae ye left
yer inteeligence? If the Glamis Ghaist
sees Dooncan he '11 shak' the life oot of
him. An' then ye may tak' the crown for
yersell.
AfcB. (struck with admiration at his
wife's superior cunning). Eh, wife, but
ye 're a gran' woman.
Lady Af. (complacently). I winna say nae
to that. But whaur wad be the guid of
havin' a bonnie braw ghaistie on the
preemises if I couldna niak' use of him

MRS. MEDWIN.
By Henry James.
III.
The situation, before Miss Cutter's return, developed in
other directions still, and -when that event took place, at a
few minutes past seven, these circumstances were, by the foot
of the stair, between mistress and maid, the subject of some
interrogative gasps and scared admissions. Lady Wantridge
had arrived shortly after the interloper, and wishing, as she
said, to wait, had gone straight up in spite of being told he was
lying down.
"She distinctly understood he was there?"
"Oh yes, ma'am—I thought it right to mention."
"And what did you call him?"
"Well, ma'am, I thought it unfair to you to call him anything
but a gentleman."
Mamie took it all in, though there might well be more of it
than one could quickly embrace. "But if she has had time,"
she flashed, " to find out he isn't one?"
"Oh ma'am, she had a quarter of an hour."
"Then she isn't with him still?"
"No, ma'am—she came down again at last. She rang, and I
saw her here, and she said she wouldn't wait longer."
Miss Cutter darkly mused. "Yet had already waited?"
"Quite a quarter."
"Mercy on us!" She began to mount. Before reaching the
top, however, she had reflected that quite a quarter was long
if Lady Wantridoe had only been Bhocked. On the other hand
it was short if she had only been pleased. But how could she
have been pleased? The very essence of their actual crisis
was just that there was no pleasing her! Mamie had but to
open the drawing-room door indeed to perceive that this was
not true at least of SCOTT Homer, who was horribly cheerful.
Miss Cotter expressed to her brother without reserve her
sense of the constitutional, the brutal selfishness that had
determined his mistimed return. It had taken place, in
violation of their agreement, exactly at the moment when it
was most cruel to her that he should be there, and if she must
now completely wash her hands of him he had only himself to
thank. She had come in flushed with resentment, and for a
moment had been voluble; but it would have been striking
that, though the way he received her might have seemed but
to aggravate, it presently justified him by causing their relation
really to take a stride. He had the art of confounding those
who would quarrel with him by reducing them to the humilia-
tion of an irritated curiosity.
"What could she have made of you? " Mamie demanded.
"My dear girl, she's not a woman who's eager to make too
much of anything—anything, I mean, that will prevent her from
doing as she likes, what she takes into her head. Of course,''
he continued to explain, "if it's something she doesn't want
to do, she '11 make as much as Moses!"
Mamie wondered if that was the way he talked to her visitor,
but felt obliged to own to his acuteness. It was an exact
description of Lady Wantridoe, and she was conscious of
tucking it away, for future use, in a corner of her miscellaneous
little mind. She withheld, however, all present acknowledg-
ment, only addressing him another question. "Did you really
get on with her?"
"Have you still to learn, darling—I can't help again putting
it to you—that I get on with everybody? That's just what I
don't seem able to drive into you! Only see how I get on with
you."
She almost stood corrected. "What I mean is, of course,
whether"
"Whether she made love to me? Shyly, yot—or because—
shamefully. She would have liked awfully to stay."
"Then why didn't she?"
"Because, on account of somo other matter—and I could see
it was true—she hadn't time. Twenty minutes—she was here
less—were all she came to give you. So don't be afraid I
frightened her away. She Ml come back."
Mamie thought it over. "Yet you didn't go with her to the
door?"
"She wouldn't let me, and I know when to do what I'm told
—quite as much as what I'm not told. She wanted to find out
about me. I mean from your little creature ; a pearl of fidelity,
by the way."
"But what on earth did she come up for?" Mamie again
found herself appealing and, just by that fact, showing her
need of help.
"Because she always goes up." Then, as, in the presence
of this rapid generalization, to say nothing of that of such a
relative altogether, Miss Cutter could only show as compara-
tively blank: "I mean she knows when to go up and when
to come down. She has instincts. She didn't know whom you
might have up here. It's a kind of compliment to*you anyway.
Why, Mamie," Soott pursued, "you don't know the curiosity
we any of us inspire. You wouldn't believe what I've seen.
The bigger bugs they are the more they 're on the look-out."
Mamie still followed but at a distance. "The look-out for
what?"
"Why, for anything that will help them to live. You've
been here all this time without making out, then, about them,
what I've had to pick out as I can? They 're dead, don't you
see? And we're alive."
"You? Oh !"—Mamie almost laughed about it.
"Well, they're a worn-out old lot, anyhow. They've used
up their resources. They do look out. And I '11 do them the
justice to say they're not afraid. Not even of me!" he
continued as his sister again showed something of the same
irony. "Lady Wantridge, at any rate, wasn't; that's what I
mean by her having made love to me. She does what she likes.
Mind it, you know." He was by this time fairly teaching her
to know one of her best friends, and when, after it, he had
come back to the great point of his lesson—that of her failure,
through feminine inferiority, practically to grasp ,the truth
that their being just as they were, he and she, was the real
card for them to play—when he had renewed that reminder he
left her absolutely in a state of dependence. Her impulse to
press him on the subject of Lady Wantridge dropped; it was
as if she had felt that, whatever had taken place, some-
thing would somehow come of it. She was to be in a
manner disappointed, but the impression helped to keep
her over to the next morning, when, as Soorr had fore-
told, his new acquaintance did reappear; explaining to Miss
Cutter that she had acted the day before to gain time
and that she even now sought to gain it by not waiting longer.
What, she promptly intimated she had asked herself, could that
friend be thinking of? She must show where she stood before
things had gone too far. If she had brought her answer without
more delay she wished to make it sharp. Mrs. Medwin?
Never !" No, my dear—not I. There I stop!"
Mamie had known it would be "collar-work," but somehow,
now, at the beginning, she felt her heart sink. It was not
that she had expected to carry the position with a rush, but
that, as always after an interval, her visitor's defences really
loomed—and quite, as it were, to the material vision—too
large. She was always planted with them, voluminous, in the
very centre of the passage; was like a person accommodated
with a chair in some unlawful place at the theatre. She
wouldn't move, and you couldn't get round. Mamie's calcula-
tion indeed had not been on getting round; she was obliged
to recognise that, too foolishly and fondly, she had dreamed of
producing a surrender. Her dream had been the fruit of her
need; but, conscious that she was even yot unequipped for
pressure, she felt, almost for the first time in her life, super-
ficial and crude. She was to be paid—but with what was she,

i
to that end, to pay? She had engaged to find an answer to
this question; but the answer had not, according to her pro-
mise, "come." And Lady Wantridoe meanwhile massed her-
self, and there was no view of her that didn't show her as
verily, by some process too obscure to be traced, the hard
depository of the social law. She was no younger, no fresher,
no stronger, really, than any of them; she was only, with a
kind of haggard fineness, a sharpened taste for life, and with
all sorts of things behind and beneath her, more abysmal and
more immoral, more secure and more impertinent. The points
she made were two in number. One was that she absolutely
declined. The other was that she quite doubted if Mamie
herself had measured the job. The thing couldn't be done.
But say it could be: was Mamie quite the person to do it?
To this Miss Cutter, with a sweet smile, replied that she
quite understood how little she might seem so. "I'm only
one of the persons to whom it has appeared that you are."
"Then who are the others ?''
"Well, to begin with—Lady Edward, Lady Bellhouse and
Mrs. Pouncer."
"Do you mean that they 'II come to meet her?"
"1 've seen them, and they've promised."
"To come, of course," Lady WANTRIDOE said, " if J come."
Her hostess hesitated. "Oh, of course you could prevent
them. But I should take it as awfully kind of you not to.
Won't you do this for me? " Mamie pleaded.
Ber friend looked about the room very much as SCOTT had
done. "Do they really understand what it's for t"
"Perfectly. So that she may call."
"And what good will that do her?"
Miss Cutter faltered, but she presently brought it out.
"Of course, what one hopes is that you '11 ask her."
"Ask her to call?"
"Ask her to dine. Ask her—if you'd be so truly sweet—for
a Sunday, or something of that sort, and even if only in one
of your most mixed parties, to Catchmore."
Miss Cutter felt the less hopeful after this effort in that her
companion only showed a strange good-nature. And it was
not the amiability of irony. Yet it was amusement. "Take
Mrs. Medwin into my family?"
"Some day when you 're taking forty others!"
"Ah, but what 1 don't see is what it does for you. You're
already so welcome among us that you can scarcely improve
your position oven by forming for us the most delightful
relation."
"Well, I know how dear you are," Mamie Cutter replied;
"but one has, after all, more than one side and more than one
sympathy. I like her, you know." And even at this Lady
Wantridoe was not shocked; she showed that ease and bland-
ness which were her way, unfortunately, of being most impos-
sible. She remarked that she might listen to such things,
because she was clever enough for them not to matter; only
Mamie should take care how she went about saying them at
large. When she became definite, however, in a minute, on
the subject of the public facts, Miss Cutter soon found herself
ready to make her own concession. Of course, she didn't
dispute them: there they were; they were unfortunately on
record, and nothing was to be done about them but to—Mamie
found it, in truth, at this point, a little difficult!
"Well, what? Pretend already to have forgotten them?"
"Why not—when you've done it in so many other cases?"
"There ore no other cases so bad. One meets them, at any
rate, as they come. Some you can manage. Others you can't.
It's no use—you must give them up. They 're past patching
—there's nothing to be done with them. There's nothing,
accordingly, to be done with Mrs. Medwin but to put her off."
And Lady Wantridoe rose to her height.
"Well, you know, I do do things!" Mamie quavered with a
smile so strained that it partook of exaltation.
"You help people? Oh, yes, I've known you to'do wonders.
But stick," said Lady Wantridoe with strong and cheerful
emphasis, "to your Americans!"
Miss Cutter, gazing, got up. "You don't do justice, Lady
Wantridoe, to your own compatriots. Some of them are really
charming. Besides," said Mamie, "working for mine often
strikes me, so far as the interest—the inspiration and excite-
ment, don't you know?—go, as rather too easy. You all, as I
constantly have occasion to say, like us so!"
Her companion frankly weighed it. "Yes—it takes that to
account for your position. I've always thought of you, never-
theless, as keeping, for their benefit, a regular working
agency. They come to you, and [you place them. There re-
mains, I confess," her ladyship went on in the same free spirit,
"the great wonder"
"Of how I first placed my poor little self? Yes," Mamie
bravely conceded, "when I began there was no agency! I just
worked my passage. I didn't even come to you, did I? You
never noticed me till, as Mrs. SHORT STOKES says, ' I was 'way,
'way up!' Mrs. Medwin," she threw in, "can't get over
it." Then, as her friend looked vague: "Over my social
situation."
"Well, it's no great flattery to you to say," Lady Want-
ridoe good humouredly returned, "that she certainly can't
hope for one resembling it." Yet it really seemed to spread
there before them. "You simply made Mrs. SHORT STOKE8."
"In spite of her name!" Mamie smiled.
"Oh, your names !In spite of everything."
"Ah, I'm something of an artist!" With which, and a
relapse, marked by her wistful eyes, into the gravity of the
matter, she supremely fixed her friend. She felt how little
she minded betraying at last the extremity of her need, and
it was out of this extremity that her appeal proceeded. "Have
I really had your last word? It means so much to me."
Lady Wantridoe came straight to the point. "You mean
you depend on it?"
"Awfully!"
"Is it all you have?"
"All. Now."
"But Mrs. Short Stokes and the others—'rolling,'aren't
they ?—don't they pay up?"
"Ah," sighed Mamie, "if it wasn't for them!"
Lady Wantridoe perceived. "You've had so much?"
"I couldn't have gone on."
"Then what do you do with it all?"
"Oh, most of it goes back to them! There are all sorts, and
it's all help. Some of them have nothing."
"Oh, if you feed the hungry," Lady Wantridoe laughed,
"you 're indeed in a great way of business. Is Mrs. Medwin"
—her transition "was immediate—" really rich?"
"Really. He left her everything."
"So that if I do say Yes"
"It will quite set mo up!"
"I see—and how much more responsible it makes one. But
I'd rather myself give you the money."
"Oh!" Mamie coldly murmured.
"You mean I mayn't suspect your prices? Well, I dare say I
don't! But I'd rather give you ten pounds."
"Oh!" Mamie repeated in a tone that sufficiently covered
her prices. The question was in every way larger. "Do you
never forgive?" she reproachfully inquired. The door opened,
however, at the moment she spoke, and Scott Homer presented
himself.
(To be continued.)

THAT FELLER'S DICTIONARY.
"Traduttori, tniditori."
In most countries and in most European
languages there may bo obtained pocket
dictionaries by a German feller called
Feller. In form they are perfect, in
type they are good, in the contents alone
can any fault be discovered. The words
—a not unimportant feature of a dic-
tionary—are at times less useful than
could bo wished. This defect, however,
is to be found in most dictionaries. Care-
ful research reveals the method
of this German feller in his
English - Italian volume. The
Highwellborn Mister Doctor
Professor—apparently un-
acquainted with either language
—has obtained the dictionary
of Johnson and that of some
Italian contemporary of the
Great Lexicographer, and,
selecting those words most
impressive by their length or
their rarity, has triumphantly
produced, according to the title
page, his "Third Stereotype
Edition."
If Goldsmith, when ho was
wandering in Italy, had met
Goldoni, ho might have appre-
ciated the dictionary of the
Herr Doktor. It must be
admitted that there are a few
anachronisms which clasli with
the words of the eighteenth
century or earlier. "Railroad"
for instance. Yet here the
editor has done his best to be
old-fashioned by choosing the
word commonly used in Eng-
land fifty years ago.
The captious tourist of to-day
may grumble at a dictionary
which entirely omits such
words as cab, omnibus, cigar,
cigarette, postage-stamp and
telegram, and gives train,
tunnel, porter, ticket and plat-
form in a sense whicli no one
requires. When he asks where
the train is and finds that he
has enquired the whereabouts
of his retinue, or when he
wishes for a railway ticket and is offered
a receipt, he will grumble yet more at this
odd Feller. As for clothes, overcoat is
overlooked altogether, but he will find
"trossers" as a plural garment and
"trouse " as a singular one—a decidedly
singular one.
Of course, in a day or two any tourist
learns the simplest substantives, but
when he first looks for cigar or cigarette
and finds neither, he may be annoyed to
discover in their place such words as,
churme, cicuration, ciliary and cineri-
tious. "Churme, riimove confuso," is
charming. Perhaps this odd Feller, who
also gives gybe and gyre, had ideas of
attempting a translation of Jabberwockij.
However, the tourist may not always
grumble. Whenever he wishes to refer to
them, and in ordinary conversation some
tourists may do this often, he will always
be able to find the Italian equivalents of
xerocollyrium, xerophthalmy, xerotes,
xiphias, xylobalsamum, xylographer and
xyster. Though flvo of these seven words
are medical terms, it must not be supposed
that a feller-feeling has prompted Dr.
Ffxler — most probably not doctor of

Gentleman. "That looks a well-bbed dog."
Owner. "I .SHOULD THINK HE WAS WELL-BBED.
HAVE A BIT EB DINNER TILL HE's GOT HIS COLLAR ON!
medicine, but of philosophy, or possibly
oven of philology—to arrange his Words-
book for dialogues with a surgeon or a
chemist. Should the unhappy tourist
catch a cold, ho might as well lose his
voice also, for he could never find words
to explain his condition. If ho went to
an Italian chemist to buy some quinine,
or a littlo vaseline, or a cake of carbolic
soap, he must remain speechless for all
the German feller would do to help him.
Only one sufferer—a case which is pro-
bably rare—could describe his complaints
and obtain remedies. A xylographer,
afflicted with a complication of xerotes
and xerophthalmy, could ask for xero-
collyrium and xylobalsamum anywhere.
Of course, one can get on very well in
the larger Italian towns without even the
few useful words provided by this remark-
able dictionary. Usually chambermaids
speak only the language of the country.
But if at the Hotel Danieli, in Venice, you
ask for hot water or a cold bath in the
purest Tuscan, or as near to it as you can
manage, the chambermaid, being Swiss,
will reply " I do not spik Italien; I spik
Anglish." If the German feller contem-
plates yet another " stereotype
edition," he might with advan-
tage have it revised by the
chambermaids at Danieli's.
They know, perhaps, as much
"Anglish" as he. In remote
places, as, for instance, Pieve
di Cadore in the Dolomites, such
linguistic attainments are rarer.
The very obliging landlord and
landlady of the hotel at Pieve
di Cadore do not attempt one
foreign word. The elderly
cashier, Signor Gaspare
Vecellio, a descendant of
Titian himself, is satisfied with
the language of his immortal
ancestor. Of the active and
obliging staff, one waiter speaks
some German, and one maid
believes that she can speak
French, and even English. The
present writer heard her once
conversing rapidly with an
American lady, who believed
that sho also could speak
French, and even English.
Around them stood the pro-
prietors, the staff, and casual
loungers, lost in admiration at
this linguistic display. Unfor-
tunately the phrases known to
the one were not apparently
those known to the other. So,
while French and English words
flew about wildly, the Italian
and American languages formed
the backbone of the con-
versation. It is in such a
town that one can use a pocket
dictionary — but not the
pharmaceutical philology of the
philosophic Feller. H. D. B.

DOMESTIC ECONOMIES.
"Economy," said I, "is the art of
saving five shillings at the expense of
ten."
"I -wish you would talk sense instead
of trying to make epigrams," replied my
■wife. "But I suppose that is hardly to
be expected of a minor poet."
The writing of occasional verses being
among the various ways in which 1 pick
up a- somewhat precarious livelihood,
Gwendolen is able, when put out, to
apply to me this most opprobrious of
epithets. I was silent.
"As I said before, when you were rude
enough to interrupt me," Gwendolen
continued, "it's quite time we began to
study economy. Last year we made two
hundred and fifty pounds, and spent"
"Oh, that was Switzerland, darling."
"And the year before"
"That was our honeymoon."
"This year, so far—" went on Gwen-
dolen, doggedly, taking up the account
book.
"My dear, I am sure you are quite
right. Let us economise by all means.
How do you propose to begin?"
"At the beginning, of course."
"And that is?"
"Pood. We mustgive up our butcher."
'' But, darling ''
"In any case, Veal says if you don't
send him a cheque"
"How irrational 1 When I've nothing
in the bankl"
"Well, he says he won't leave another
cutlet"
"Then you'd better say you'll with-
draw your custom."
"But suppose I had to carry out the
threat, would anyone olse supply us?"
I had to admit that it was doubtful.
"Well," concluded my wife illogically,
and abruptly returning to the point from
which we had both unconsciously strayed,
"you needn't talk about sticking to
Vkal"
"My dear, I suggested leaving him."
"Until you can find some editor to
accept your masterpieces."
"Sarcasm," said I, "one expects from
enemies; one puts up with it from friends;
but from a wife"
"Darling, I was horrid."
Intellectually I am to Gwendolen as a
giant to a dwarf. She is a woman—I, a
man. She scribbles the fashion column in
the Woman's World, and sentimental
stories for inferior magazines. I, on the
other hand, in addition to verses, write
Meredithian Novels and learned articles
for—I do not say in—the great Reviews.
Still, when Gwendolen comes and sits
upon my knee and, putting her soft arm
round my neck, gently pats my cheek
with her plump little hand, I confess I am
ready to concede any point she may ask
me to agree to.

Having smoothed my ruffled suscepti-
bilities by the familiar means, GWENDOLEN
proceeded to disclose her plans.
"Instead of dealing any longer with
Veal and extortionate tradesmen, I mean
to shop in the King's Road on Saturday
night. Yes," continuedGwENDOLEN,ignor-
ing my lifted eyebrows, "I'm told you

"Is it?"
"A shilling is tenpenco more than.two-

"Nothing is twopence less than two-

"I've calculated," said GWENDOLEN,
paying no attention to my frivolous
suggestion, "that if we do our week's
shopping on Saturday night, wo '11 save

mind ''

LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. II.— The Duke op Donnybrook and Bow.
(Continued.)
The Duke, I should have said before,
Although he liked the fair much,
Lived all his life a bachelor, •
And didn't seem to care much.
Though often tenderly inclined,
And twice within an ace of
Engagement rings, he failed to find
A girl to make Her Grace of.
He owed immunity from strife
(And that was all he did owe)
To this: he lived without a wife,
And died without a widow.
So, when the old man sank to sleep,
We mourned for him the rather
That not a son was left to weep
The loss of such a father.
Male relatives of all degrees
He once had had by dozens,
They all were doomed to predecease—
His uncles, nephews, cousins.
Throughout his life the Duke had been
In almost ceaseless mourning:
His cousins vanished from the scene
Without a word of warning.
Just aa the Duke regained his smile
And ceased to be condolent,
One cousin met a lion, while
Another plumbed the Solent.
A third up Monte Rosa went—
It took him hours to win it.
He made an unforeseen descent
In less than half a minute.
A fourth would chase the fox, and Fate,
While he was chasing, chased him.
She had a longish time to wait
Before the jade outpaced him.
She caught him girt with hunting folk,
And, though he fain had missed her,
A neck or nothing man, he broke
The former with the Bicester.
But why the fatal list pursue?
I've given you a sample.
To prove that what I say is true
These instances are ample.
All men who heard the story deemed
The Duke unduly careless:
In such a well-known Duke it seemed
Unjust to be so heirless.
At Court the news gave great surprise,
But, though no doubt the Kino wished
That facts had shaped it otherwise,
The Dukedom seemed extinguished.
Now mark the sequel; lay it well to heart.
Note how the fortunes of great families
And ancient houses hang upon a hair;
How a mere chance may shatter them, and how
A humble hand may 'stablish them again.
The dead Duke's family solicitors
Were Messrs. Deedswell, Ginnyfee and Ritter,
A well-known firm. They carried on their work
Within the classic Fields of Lincoln's Inn.
Much had they grieved when their old client died,
Not idly, as a common man might grieve,
But deeply with a poignant business-grief
As of three men who see a stream of wealth
Dry at its source, and know not where to turn
To find another half so bountiful.
Never again would it be theirs to send
Those stout half-yearly bills so promptly paid:
So much "for writing you," so much again
"For two attendances re Broseley Farm ";
"For taking your instructions" so much more;
"For drawing deed "—you know the way it runs,
With all its folios; "for engrossing same "—
In short the items all set down that make
Grist for the comfortable lawyer's mill.
Never again! The thought made Deedswell sad,
And Ginnyfee was sad, and Ritter too.
To them thus grieving came their Clerk, a man
Bred to the law and by the law made keen.
He, since the Duke had died, had made the case
His own: full many a wakeful night he passed
With all the dull and dusty documents
Wherein was writ the story of the house.
Much had he pored o'er ancient muniments,
Had mastered all the records of the race,
Their origin, their genealogy,
Duly worked out in complicated trees.
Thus fortified and crammed and brimming o'er,
He came before his gloomy principals,
And at a nod from Ginnyfee he spoke:
"Sirs, I assume that you are seized of all
The salient points that mark this tragedy,
For tragedy it is as all men know.
I spare you their recital and proceed
Straight to my point, the very point of points,
Though noted by no mortal man before.
It is recorded that the thirteenth Duke
Was born in 1752; he died
In 1820, having had two sons.
One, who was born in 1785,
Succeeded him as fourteenth Duke; with him
We are not now concerned, but with his brother
Born three years later, 1788.
What of that Ducal scion, Gentlemen?
How fared it with him? What became of him?"
Hereat the heavy cloud on DEEDS WELL'S face
Lifted, and Ginnyfee was seen to smile.
And Ritter said, "Proceed, young man, proceed!"
"Lord Arthur Battlemore," the Clerk went on,
"(That was the young man's name) was very wild;
A harum-scarum temper marked his acts.
What then? Here comes the point: they shipped him off,
When he was twenty-two, to Africa,
And he was never heard of after that.
Whether he lived or died, or if he married
And reared a family, no man can say
For certain—but I think we should enquire.
For it may chance that in that torrid land
Some grandson or great grandson yet may live.
Should we not seek him? Must we not exhaust
All means to find an heir to him we mourn?"
He ceased, but his three principals broke out
In exultation: never was there heard
So great a noise from three solicitors.
"Eureka!" Deeds well cried; it was not true,
But Ritter echoed him, and Ginnyfee,
Swept beyond prudence, cried " Eureka 1 " too.

Being a forecast of M. Edmond Rostand's Ode of Salutation from
France to the Czar.
CaiRi, you como!
Par on the faint horizon's curve,
A thousand patient telescopes observe
My love's approaching chimney-stacks 1 • ■
The eager semaphore r..-
Gesticulates with amorous arms,
Bidding the wide-mouthed cannon roar
Their glad alarms;
The clarion tootles and the urgent drum
Gives off its deep erotic rum-ti-tum;
Conscious of civic dues
M. le Maire,
Has his sublime discourse by heart;
Meanwhile the eloquent air
Breathes bunting; over Ocean's local surge,
Already teeming with vociferous smacks,
A halcyon calm, for this occasion, coos;
And I, your lonely love, emerge,
As by a swift sea-change,
From playing that most tedious part
Of Mariana in the Moated Grange.
For you the poet's fingers, all on fire,
Set to the sounding lyre
An ode replete with loyalty and laud;
For you our naval squadrons shall perform
The opening figure, well-rehearsed,
Of a descent on faithless Albion's coasts;
For you our captious boilers, overawed,
This once have undertaken not to leak;
For you our Infantry shall mass their hosts
In Grand Manoeuvres splendidly antique;
For you our Cavalry shall burst
In one long rolling thunder-storm,
Reckless of umpires, onward to the death;
For you, with bated breath,
Oar native Fowl shall curb his diddle-doo;
For you the Legion's buttons, and for you
Our Treasury shall contrive
A further loan for supplemental dower;
Yea and for you your love has gone
And put her best confections on,
Tremulous for the long-expected hour
When on this panting bosom you arrive I
Ah 1 may no blizzard intervene
To mar our mutual joys! no rain bedew
The scarf of tricolor, red, white and blue,
Lashed to your tunic with a true-love knot!
May no insensate submarine
(Pride of our fleet) grow restive 'neath the brine,
And, getting out of hand,
Puncture your bark below the water-line
Or ere you leap to land!
Oh, may no worthy red-cap sansculotte,
In pauses of the Afarseiilaise
Or Russian Anthem, prance
Indignant, or his lusty voice upraise
In language calculated to offend
Absolute Empire, visible in the friend
Of Freedom-loving France!
Dearest (and costliest),
Let me consider why I love you so;
What is the thought of you
That most particularly thrills
The nerves of this impressionable breast?
It is not merely your intrinsic charms;
Nor that you come with conquering arms
Straight from Manchuria where the Boxers grow
(Making such useful grist for my love's mills),
And, as the harbinger of wars to cease,
Consent to pass our warriors in review;
Ono!
Not that you stand confessed
A "little father" to the Finns;
Nor that in culture and the arts of peace,
In every sooial scheme
To lavish liberty upon the thrall,
In every philanthropic plan
Conducive to the Brotherhood of Man,
We two would seem
To be inseparable twins:—
That is not all.
There is a cause, more delicate than these,
Why I intend to fly
Into your arms direct and grip you tight,
Why I am anxious even to engage
In open osculation on the quays;
It is for joy of Albion's jealous eye,
For pure delight
To hear her gnash her teeth in helpless rage.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In Love and His Mask (Heinemann), Menik MURIEL
Dowie tries what is for her a new method and
makes a great success of it. The self-deception
of Lestie Rose, a most engaging heroine, is
elaborately worked out, and it has the merit of
being convincing. Altogether a very clever
novel brightly written, with just that amount of
Khaki flavour which rather more than "half-suspected
animates the whole."
The Baron once, and not so very long ago, suggested a series of
"Bogie Books." Had this idea been caught up and acted upon
by any spirited publisher—of course, only a publisher in con-
junction with some'' spirit'' could adequately deal with what was
a mere ghost of an idea—then Richard Marsh's The Joss: A
Reversion (F. White & Co.) would at first sight, that is judging
by its earlier chapters, be entitled to a place on the shelves
devoted to "TerribleTales" and "Many Mysteries." But at
"second sight"—most appropriately used in dealing with this
sort of work—the Baron qualifies his opinion, and says that if a
"Han well Bogie Series" or a series of "Muddle-Headed
Mysteries," were in existence, Robert Marsh's romance ought
to rank among its chiefest ornaments. After the earlier

chapters " O what a falling oft is there!"
It picks up again towards the finish, but
'tis only a fitful fiash-in-the-pan illumi-
nating a chapter or two, and then, with-
out even a fizzle, it is gone. Better re-
read Wilkie CoiXlNS'S Moonstone or Edgar
Poe's Beetle.
The Temple Classics (J. M. Dent & Co.)
still continue their excellent course,
with, apparently, undiminished "power
of adding to the number." Among the
very latest is the most charming and
most ancient Romance of the Rose admir-
ably translated and rhythm'd by P. S.
Ellis, from the original of Guillaume de
Lorris and Jean de Meun. This Romance
■was written before Chaucer was "born
or thought of." At the close of his inter-
esting preface, Mr. Ellis, referring to the
"word-play," otherwise puns, in which
Jean de Meun, like Shakspeare, de-
lighted, is needlessly apologetic, though
apologising in defiant tone, because quite
sure of his ground when ho says, " Good
critic "—of course he only addresses him-
self to good critics—" ere you censure "—
the Baron, going one better than 'good,'
will not even find fault—" try your hand."
Which is as much as to say, plainly, "take
this up as a holiday task, my fine fellow,
and see how you like it." Now the Baron
did take the Rose up qua holiday task,
and liked it so much that it became
temporarily his constant companion. A
propos of this the Baron ventures on
erratic rhyming paraphrase after the
style of Wandering Willie:
"Good critic, ere you censure
Try your hand."
And then, sure,
You'll understand
How difficult the task hath been
So well by Ellis done, I ween,
That nobody can deny it 1
Or, if they do,
Then say I, "Pooh!
Let Somebody Ellis try it!"
W. Lorris and John Clopinel "flour-
ished"—their memory is yet green and
their leaves immortelles—" circa 1280 and
1270. Their work was first printed about
1475, having previously been partly tran-
slated by Chaucer and another ( " name I
name!") about 1865: and here we are
enjoying it, as fresh and as true as
ever it was, in the Year of Grace 1901.

adapted and headed "Of Naval Adven-

and season. In future years will not the
author chuckle over these lines of his—
"With the moon at full quarter we enter our quads
By an ojJen ascent of the palings,
So little we reck of the wrath of the gods,
Or a Dean and his railings!"
Delightful escapades—to look back upon!
Wonderful flights of poetry and fancy!
"H<ec olim," &c. There's a spring-breezy
lilt about these verses that inspires the
musically-inclined with the desire of
setting and singing them to his own com-
position, moro or less original. Humour,
quiet or buoyant, is of the essence of these
Horatian imitations. Chants the Baron,
previous to quaffing a beaker,
In this sparkling Moet

A TEN DAYS' TRIP.
Sunday morning.—Good weather or bad weather, and taking
the rough with the smooth, and an unfair proportion of the
rough without the smooth, we sight Christiansand. Cool on
board: but on shore, melting, scorching! So, except first to
have a stroll and see, as the conversation books have it, "the
fine streets," "the good shops," and to note the particularly
cleanly appearance of Christiansand and its delightful air of
Sunday-like repose, more remarkable than in any sea-side
place in Scotland that I can call to mind, we, that is, two
of us at least, after a stroll, are glad to return to the ship and
there remain with our books and conversation, diversified by
the leisurely excercise of occasionally promenading the deck.
Wortlkr, perfectly recovered from effects of roughish night,
and impelled by vigorous reaction, has been early ashore, and,
with all the zeal of a First Discoverer, has, as I learn after-
wards, seen most of what there was to be seen within a radius
of twenty miles, has made the acquaintance of several Norwegian
families (by whom he had been invited to stay or at least revisit
them as early as possible) and is now, when reappearing on
deck, after at least five hours ashore, quite ready to play a
"speaking part" as a thorough Norwegian, having picked
up and mastered so much of the language as might bo neces-
sary to his purpose within the short leave of absence granted
by the Captain. Then, after bidding cheery farewells to many
of our companions who are going away on shooting and fishing
expeditions, waving adieux to others remaining on the pier to
see us off, the Orlando starts for Christiania.
So delightful a sail round the coast from Christiansand to
Christiania, that at night the concert party is able to give
a varied entertainment. Re-appearance of Wagstaff, who, un-
asked, gives us a song or two. This is very thoughtful of
him, as it decides in the negative, once and for all, the question
as to whether he should be requested to perform on some future
occasion. Wortlkr, on excessively pressing invitation, gives
us a telling recitation from Bret Harte that brings tears to
the eyes of the ladies and would have spread rather a gloom
over the company generally, but for the Captain, who, after
publicly thanking Wortler, forthwith restores our spirits by
himself contributing considerably to the harmony of the meeting
and thus setting us all going again quite merrily.
Monday morning, Christiania.—Arriving, We are much struck
by the lightness, brightness, and bustle of the place. It is
very early, and seems as if the curtain had just risen on the
opening scene of an opera, all "movement" and market chorus.
Landing-stage-management excellent. Carts and open voitures
("vogns" according to the Cook-ery Book's vocabulary) every-
where. Likewise tramcars all over the principal streets.
A network of them. OSCAR is King of Sweden and Denmark.
The 'os is disappearing, except for voitures and wagons, and
only the car remains. Why not change title to King Tramcar the
First. And with this witticism, his last on the present occasion,
Wagstaff disappears from the scene. He is on a fishing
expedition, and the "-first thing I have to catch," he says,
"is a train." So "exit Wagstaff," and may joy and jokes go
with him!
Thought I should see some carioles, of which species of con-
veyance much has been heard, likewise a few slotkjoerres, await-
ing us. To my great disappointment, none are in evidence, only
the usual sort of open fly to hold four, generally driven by most
respectable-looking coachmen, infinitely superior to the majority
of cockers in Paris, and to our "growler cabbies" in London.
Also, within my travelling experience (which in a short time is
considerable, as the weather, on the occasion of our visit, is so
overpoweringly hot in Christiania, worse even than in Christian-
sand, that I refuse to walk as long as a cab or a tram can be
obtained), I am bound to say that never anywhere have I known
cabmen so polite or so honest as these of Christiania. "Honest,
my Lord? Aye, honest: for to be honest as this world goes is
to be as one man picked out of ten thousand." Hamlet the
Dane, must have had the ilite of uogn-drivers in his eye at that
moment.
The coachmen we employed never overcharged, stuck exactly
to the tariff, never once asked for a "pour-boire," were most civil
and polite in their manner, and, on more than one occasion, when,
through want of familiarity with the coinage, we had acciden-
tally overpaid our driver, he took off his hat most courteously,
shook his head, handed back the surplus, and was about to drive
away, when, as in courtesy bound, we pressed the extra fifty
"ohre" (about half a franc) on his acceptance, whereupon,
this noble descendant of a line of Nonvegian Vikings who had
driven their enemies out of the land, smilingly accepted the
gratuity, bowed, and rattled away with a light heart and
empty trap.
"Rattled!" Oh, the rattling of everything with wheels over
the awful big-stoned pavements of these streets! If any one
wants to have a "real rattling time of it," let him go to
Christiania and drive about in any vehicle, no matter what.
When in one of these traps, and going slow or fast, speaking
is difficult, talking impossible. There are some quiet streets,
but they are very few and very far between within the cab
radius of the town. If there were any, they are lost to memory
in the rattle and jolting of the vogn over the stones. "Rattle
his bones Over the stones, Driving about In one of their vognsl"
In fact, never take a cab unless, by staying in the town, you
have become acclimatised to the noise, but employ the trams,
which are swift, sure, and comporatire/y—only comparatively,
mark you—noiseless.
What strikes one first and most forcibly in Norway, that is, at
least, in Christiania, is the civility, which is beyond mere polite-
ness, of everybody towards "the stranger within their gates."
In Christiania a Londoner, accustomed to travel at home and
abroad, will marvel at the entire absence of beggars. Anyone
attempting to beg is "downed upon" at once by the wary
police (the streets are well but not obtrusively police'd), and
therefore the professional beggar's occupation is gone, although
a few may be seen, as I am informed, here and there holding out
their hats as receptacles for coin, but not uttering a plaint.
Of these, within three days' time and going alwnt—walking, or
driving, or in tram,—pretty well everywhere, 1, personally, saw
only one single example.

Tho trams arc first-rate, except for noise. As for distance,
they go up-hill, a pretty steep but gradual ascent, to Holmen
Kollen, via Majorstuen (a trajet of about an hour or so), -where
there is a huge restaurant, a hotel in case you want to stay the
night, and tables whereat the visitors may sit and refresh
themselves as they gaze on the beautiful panoramic view of
the islands, town and harbour, the outlines occasionally
blurred by rising haze. The return journey takes about half
an hour, as tho electric tram docs "the double" on the down-
ward way—a real /riciits descensus—back to Majorstuen.
I am not now writing a guido to Christiania, but simply
mentioning the town as the objective of a trip from London to
anyone who cannot spare more than ten days for a holiday, and
would like to spend six of those on river, sea, and fiord, starting
from Tilbury.
Avis aux Voyagctirs.—If you cannot get in at the Grand Hotel,
Christiania, go to tho Victoria. Put up at tho one, or put up
with the other. Tho Grand, however, for choice, as it is in all
respects quite up to latest date. There may, perhaps, be other
hotels in Christiania equally as good as the Grand, but none,
1 feel sure, superior.
Should you have time you may discover many a cafe" where
you can procure a bottle of light wine, excellent, at a kronin
(i.e. thirteen pence halfpenny), for which at any "first-class"
hotel you will be charged two kronin and a-half.
I am not aware of there being an early closing movement in
Christiania; at all events, there are no signs of it as, at past
midnight, after quitting the restaurant, we are rattled back,
with occasional swervings of the vehicle, caused by tho wheels
gripping the interlacing tram-lines, to the Hotel Victoria.
THE SUBMERGED SUBURBS.
[A em respondent in the Timet suggests that sea-water should be taken
in at Brighton, stored in the Crystal Palace heights, and thence distri-
buted all over London.]
O Prince of bold projects, that seem
Our wonderful period to crown!
At last they are broaching a scheme
For bringing sea-water to town.
A'o more in cheap trains shall we ride,
In quest of far distant sea shores,
Since here is a plan to provide
The ocean itself at our doors.
Soon Dalston with Margate shall vie,
Ozone it will give us to sniff,
And outlying suburbs supply
Sea-breezes refreshing and stiff.
Lo ! henceforth Victoria Park
Tho whiff of the briny inhales;
There swims to the Zoo the stray shark,
The Serpentine's teeming with whales.
To win for the public this prize—
Sea-water in London at will—
It needs but a plan to devise
To get it to travel uphill.
Town and Country.—A sight to be seen frequently in towns
in times of great excitement, but never to be met with in the
country, i.e. "Ugly Rushes." In the low-lying lands they are
always picturesque, and, bending to the breeze, most graceful.
"Vaccination Concerts," as mentioned recently in the
Times, ought to have something very "taking" about them.
How appropriate would be the old Scotch song, "Oh, dear,
what can the matter bet"

Vicar's DauglUer. "On, Mrs. Upton, do you know I am going
to Lady Raceby's garden party next week?"
Mrs. Uptmi. "Really, dear? I hope you'll enjoy it. But
they tell me that Lady Raceby is so much less exclusive than
she used to be!"

GREAT EXPECTATIONS.
I COME from haunts of grouse and hare,
And, free from worldly burdens,
I linger in dear Berkeley Square,
Or loiter round the Durdana.
I roam by some Italian lake,
I make a sudden sally,
And into twain my party break
Whene'er it tries to rally.
And next I widen up the breach,
Since I can do no better,
With here and there a little speech,
And here and there a letter.
A score of papers curse me well,
A dozen sing my praises,
And half-a-hundred posters tell
My very latest phases.
I draw my followers along,
I make still fresh seceders,
I mingle those cross-currents strong
That fret unhappy leaders.
Then in again I go, and laugh,
To hide my cerebellum
Mid many a tome of stately calf
And many a tome of vellum.
I sit, I sigh, I gloom, I groan
Of new Imperialism;
I plough my furrow all alone,
I sow. the seeds of schism;
But out again I come, and lo!
Men cease expecting never,
For Campbells come and Harcourts go,
But I go on forever.
WHIFFLETON'S BOGEY.
A Story with a Moral.
I.
Whiffleton was a good fellow—not a
genius, an hereditary omission that
gladdened the hearts of his friends, but—
a genial, reliable, easy-tempered chap,
with just a few foibles to redeem his
character from virtuous insipidity. When,
however, Whiffleton returned from his
summer holiday, it was clear that some-
thing had happened. He was gloomy and
taciturn, and used to leave the club
at some disgracefully early hour. We
were deeply concerned about him and
hazarded various explanations as to the
change.
"I didn't like the way he sipped his
whisky last night," said Mullet in a
melancholy tone. "It seems to me the
chap's drifting towards—why, hang it,
you know, I believe he's actually falling
into—teetotalism."
"Pooh," remarked GREGSON. "You 're
too morbid, Mullet." Gregson rarely
advanced any view of his own, but made a
point of pooh - poohing other people's
views. "Depend upon it, Whiffleton's
moodiness, whatever it arises from, has
nothing to do with that."
"The explanation's easy enough," said
the Colonel. "Six weeks in south-west
Cornwall, and liver to follow. Oh, nothing
but liver could have made him so glum
last night, when I told that dreadfully
funny story—you remember ?''
The others assented hastily.
"I still think," asserted Mullet, "that
he's meditating some fad. There's abso-
lutely no reason why a bachelor of forty,
with £5,000 a year, and excellent health,
and—er — dashed good friends, should
mope, unless he had got some silly whim
into his head."
"Only two things make a sane man
mope—liver and love," put in the Colonel,
and he knocked out his pipe with an air of
finality. "If it isn't liver, it's the other
thing."
"Not a bit," said Gregson, with a
Burleigh-like shake of the head. "None
of the usual signs."
"What are the usual signs?" enquired
Mullet, with a sudden thirst for infor-
mation.
But Gregson was not to be drawn.
At this moment Whiffleton came up.
"Well," he said, "you all look worried
and just a thought disputatious. What
is it—the War?"
"No, my boy, khaki-ng care of another
kind," replied the Colonel, 'with a
snigger.
Whiffleton rounded on the speaker in
an unexpected blaze of anger.
"What on earth has come over you?"
interposed Mullet. "That's what we
want to know!"
(To be concluded.)

MORE ANTIQUITIES FOR LONDON
LOCAL MUSEUMS.
(See "Punch," Sept. 4.)
Annotated List ok Exhibits, Continued.
"Domestic Servant (Mnmmy)." An
extremely rare and finely-preserved
specimen of a vanished class, -whose
extinction dates from 1901 A.D. It is
therefore of the highest interest to the
anthropologist and the comparative
anatomist. Its duties are now performed,
perhaps more effectively, by the automa-
tic" general" and the electric dumb-
waiter. When alive, it commanded the
salary of a prima donna, and towards the
close of its career was engaged by the
Syndicate Halls to give exhibition per-
formances in the now obsolete arts, of
plate-smashing and "giving notice."
"Semi-circular Wooden Framework—
probably a so-called 'Paddle-box.'" Wo
have here, no doubt, part of the strange
craft, propelled by steam, which plied
between landing-stages on the Thames at
irregular intervals from 1840 until well
within the twentieth century, when they
gradually fell to pieces. This portion was
dredged up from the river-bed, when the
foundations for the new half-tide lock at
Westminster were being laid.
"View of an Advertisement-Hoarding
(early Edwardian). About this period there
was a remarkable craze for covering up
every available elevation with crude de-
signs in flaring colours, mostly on behalf
of sundry nostrums and condiments. The
sums spent on these "posters" (as they
were termed) increased to such an extent
that there were, at last, no funds left to
produce the wares advertised, and the
mania, therefore, died a natural death.
"Model of Street Excavations." The
chief amusement of the "authorities"
(■\tho these were could never be ascer-
tained), at the beginning of the Tube
and Telephone Era, was to hand over the
most important thoroughfares to gangs of
navvies, with instructions to investigate
the nature of the London subsoil, to
search for pre-historic finds, to shift
every pipe encountered, and to lay as
many others as possible, with the maximum
amount of inconvenience to passengers
and householders. This state of things
continued until a general collapse of
houses along the Strand and elsewhere
engulfed the workmen and contractors in
a ready-made and well-merited grave.
On Dit.—" Not for years," says the
Westminster Gazette, "has such good
sport been enjoyed among the grouse."
Doesn't this look as if the grouse were
thoroughly enjoying themselves?

'WE HAVI FED OUR SKA FOR A THOUSAND TEAKS."—Kipling.
THE CRUISE OF THE SABRINA.
III.—A Lady of Cockles.
Extracts from the Travel Diary of
Tory, M.P.
Waterford, Saturday.—Hitherto thought
of Waterford chiefly in connection with dear
old (perennially young) Dick Power, who
represented it in the House of Commons
for many years, distraught between his
duties as Whip of the Parnellite party and
his passion for hunting. Also, Waterford
contributed Major O'GORMAN to West-
minster. Alack 1 the Nationalist party of
to-day has no successor to either. But
Waterford still has its Suir, one of the
finest -waterways in the kingdom. Bobs
has often dreamed of it, whether on his
way to Kandahar or Pretoria. He is a
Waterford "boy," descended on the
distaff side from a Huguenot family that
settled here little more than three hun-
dred years ago.
"His great-grandfather lived in Patrick
Street," said a friendly sergeant of
police in a coat adorned with much-
frayed frogs, whom we met by the old
French church. "He was an architect and
had twenty-four children."
The sequence was not inevitable, but it
satisfied our philosopher and friend -with
the frayed frogs.
"Just the two dozen," he added, com-
placently.
Certainly one more or less would have
spoiled the symmetry of the family circle.
"He was buried here and his French
wife too. Also his son and hu wife, both
of this parish. Himself" (meaning Bobs)
"will come here at the end of his last
march."
May the day be far off!
Meanwhile it is to be hoped that when it
dawns the official who has charge of the
key of the church will not be away on
his holiday. He is so enjoyiug himself
just now, and consequently, to the
genuine distress of our friend with the
frogs, we can't see the interior of the
ruined edifice. Why a gentleman in
charge of a church door-key, presumably
of considerable size, should pack it up in
his portmanteau when he goes for his
annual holiday is one of those things the
simple Saxon cannot understand.
Content, perforce, with feasting the eye
on the beautiful tower, first seen as we
reached our moorings, its dainty outline
standing out amid the squalid shops and
warehouses flanking the quay. Founded
in 1240 as a Franciscan Friary, Henry the
Third richly endowed it. Not much of
the structure left to-day; the ruins
closed in on all sides by mean modern
habitations. What remains is a precious
possession, illustrating afresh the familiar
lesson that whilst the march of civilisation
shows most things better done in the
twentieth century than in Plantagenet
times, we have lost by the way the art
of architecture.
In the afternoon drove across country
— there and back eighteen miles — to
Woodstown Strand. On the way, pa
the residence of Lady Carew, who
charmed the court of Charles the Tenth
of France with her pretty face and her
Irish poplin frock. In her 108rd year she
is still, Sauk says, a formidable hand at
chess.
On the beach made a charming acquaint-
ance. She was about four feet five high,
and fully half the measurement in circum-
ference of the waist. Her costume was
tailor-made to the extent that its variety
was largely composed of odds and ends
from a series of male wardrobes. Her
age might be sixty. In a face tanned to
mahogany hue twinkled a pair of laughing
eyes. Her voluminous skirts did not
droop far below her generous knees.
Presumably from motives of economy she
wore only one garter. From the leg whose
turn to wear the garter was not to-day
something that was originally a sack, and
now served as a stocking, drooped to her
heel. This negligence displayed what at
first sight might have been taken for a
highly-polished mahogany bedpost; but
was otherwise. Honi *oit qui mal y
pense.
She had spent the morning in picking
cockles, digging them out of their retreat
in the wet sand with virile forefinger.
Her treasure was displayed at the bottom
of a small much-mended sack.
"What fine cockles," I exclaimed, with
polite desire to open conversation with a
lady to whom I had not been formally
presented.
"Deed, yer Honour," she said, fondly
dipping her hands in the heap and drop-
ping their fulness back into the sack,
"they're fit for anny society."
With this recommendation, we bought
the lot and carried them back to Water-
ford in the well of the outside car. An
excellent breakfast dish.
Queenstown, Sunday.—Moored close by
H.M.S. Howe. After breakfast the blue-
jackets and marines, dressed all in their
best, muster for inspection on the
snowy decks. We can see the captain and
his chief officers passing down the lines.
The band begins to play; the music,
wafted by a light western breeze, floats
around the yacht. Pretty to see how the
sea-gulls, for hours circling and shrilly
chattering in the space between the
man-of-war and the yacht, become mute,
and, settling down on the water, beat time
to the m«sic as they rise and fall on the
swell of the sunlit sea.
THE MOTOR CAR.
Air—"The Low-back'd Car"
When first I saw sweet Peggy,
'Twas on an Autumn day,
A motor car she drove and got
In everybody's way.
It made such hay of blooming grass
When blund'ring off the road,
It went o'er stones
With grunts and groans,
I thought it would explode.
As she sat in the motor car,
We shouted from ever so far,
"Hallo there I I sayl
Get out of the way
Of that Juggernaut motor car 1"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MRS. MEDWIN.
By Henry James.
IV.
Scott Homer wore exactly, to his sister's eyes, the aspect he
had -worn the day before, and it also formed, to her sense, the
groat feature of his impartial greeting.
"How d'ye do, Mamie? How d'ye do, Lady Wantridge?"
"How d'ye do again?" Lady Wantridge replied with an
equanimity striking to her hostess. It was as if Scott's own
had been contagious; it was almost indeed as if she had seen
him before. Had she ever so seen him—before the previous
day? While Miss Cotter put to herself this question her
visitor, at all events, met the one she had previously uttered.
"Ever 'forgive'?" this personage echoed in a tone that
made as little account as possible of the interruption. "Dear,
yes! The people I luxve forgiven!" She laughed—perhaps a
little nervously; and she was now looking at Scott. The way
she looked at him was precisely what had already had its effect
for his sister. "Tlife people I can!"
"Can you forgive me ?" asked Scott Homer.
She took it so easily !" But—what?"
Mamie interposed; she turned directly to her brother.
"Don't try her. Leave it so." She had had an inspiration; it
was the most extraordinary thing in the world. "Don't try
him "—she had turned to their companion. She looked grave,
sad, strange. "Leave it so." Yes, it was a distinct inspira-
tion, which she couldn't have explained, but which had come,
prompted by something she had caught—the extent of the
recognition expressed—in Lady Wantridge's face. It had come,
absolutely, of a sudden, straight out of the opposition of the
two figures before her—quite as if a -concussion had struck a
light. The light was helped by her quickened sense that her
friend's silence on the incident of the day before showed some
sort of consciousness. She looked surprised. "Do you know
my brother?"
"Do I know you?" Lady Wantridge asked of him.
"No, Lady Wantridge," Scott pleasantly confessed, "not
ono little mite!"
"Well then, if you must go !" and Mamie offered her a
hand. "But I'11 go down with^'ou. Not you!" she launched
at her brother, who immediately effaced himself. His way ol
doing so—and he had already done so, as for Lady Wantridge, in
respect to their previous encounter—struck her even at tho
moment as an instinctive if slightly blind tribute to her
possession of an idea; and as such, in its celerity, made her so
admire him, and their common wit, that, on tho spot, she more
than forgave him his queerness. Ho was right. He could be
as queer as he liked! The queerer the better: It was at tho
foot of the stairs, when she had got her guest down, that what
sho had assured Mrs. Medwin would como did indeed come.
"Did you meet him here yesterday?"
"Dear, yes. Isn't he too funny?"
"Yes," said Mamie gloomily. "He is funny. But had you
evor met him before?"
"Dear, no!"
"Oh !"—and Mamie's tone might have meant many things.
Lady Wantridge, however, after all, easily overlooked it.
"I only knew he was one of your odd Americans. That's why,
when I hoard yesterday, here, that he was up there awaiting
your return, I didn't let that prevent me. I thought he might
be. He certainly," her ladyship laughed, "is."
"Yes, he's very American," Mamie went on in the same way.
"As you say, we jure fond of.you! Good-bye," jsaid Lady
Wantridge. \
But MAMIE had not half done with her. She felt more and
more—or she hoped at least—that she looked strange. She was,
no doubt, if it came to that, strange. "Lady Wantridge," she
almost convulsively broke!out, :"I don't know! whether you '11
understand me, but I seem to feel that I must act with you—I
don't know what to call it I—responsibly. He is my brother."
"Surely—and why not?" Lady Wantridge stared. "He's
the image of you !''
"Thank you !"—and Mamie was stranger than ever.
"Oh, he's good looking. He's handsome, my dear. Oddly
—but distinctly!" Her ladyship was for treating it much as a
joke.
But Mamie, all sombre, would have none of this. She boldly
gave him up. "I think he's awful."
"He is indeed—delightfully. And where do you get your
ways of saying things? It isn't anything—and the things
aren't anything. But it's so droll."
"Don't lot yourself, all the same," Mamie consistently
pursued, "be carried away by it. The thing can't be done—
simply."
Lady Wantridge wondered. "' Done simply '?"
"Done at all."
"But what can't be?"
"Why, what you might think—from his pleasantness. What
he spoke of your doing for him."
Lady Wantridge recalled. "Forgiving him?"
"He asked you if you couldn't. But you can't. It's too
dreadful for me, as so near a relation, to have, loyally—loyally
to you—to say it. But he's impossible."
It was so portentously produced that her ladyship had some-
how to meet it. "What's the matter with him?"
"I don't know."
"Then what's the matter with you?" Lady Wantridge
laughed.
"It's because I won't know," Mamie—not without dignity—
explained.
"Then I won't cither!"
"Precisely. Don't. It's something," Mamie pursued with
some inconsequence, "that—somewhere or other, at some time
or other—he appears to have done; something that has made
a difference in his life."
"'Something'?" Lady Wantridge echoed again. "What
kind of thing?"
Mamie looked up at tho light above the door, through
which the London sky was doubly dim. "I haven't the least
idea."
"Then what kind of difference?"
Mamie's gaze was still at tho light. "The difference you
see."
Lady Wantridge, rather obligingly, seemed to ask herself
what she saw. "But I don't see any! It seems, at least,"
sho added, "sucli an amusing one! And he has such nico
eyes."
"Oh, dear eyes!" Mamie conceded; but with too much
sadness, for the moment, about the connections of the subject,
to say more.
It almost forced her companion, after an instant, to proooid.
"Do you mean he can't go home?"
She weighed her responsibility. "I only make out—moro's
the pity !—that he doesn't."
"Is it then something too terrible——?"
She]thought again. "I don't know w-hat—for men—it too
terrible."
"Well then, as you don't know what 'is' for women either
—good-bye !" her visitor laughed.
It practically [wound up the inteiview; which, however,
terminating thus on a considerable stir of the air, was to give
Miss Cutter, the next few days, the sense ol being much blown
about. The degree to which, to begin with, she had been
drawn—or perhaps rather pushed—closer to SCOTT was marked
in the brief colloquy that, on her frit nil's departure, she had
with him. "You '11 see if she doesn't ask mo down!" he had
immediately said.
";So soon?"

"Oh, I've known them, at places—at
Cannes, at Pau, at Shanghai—to do it
sooner still. I always know when they
will. You can't make out they don't love
me!" He spoko almost plaintively—as
if he wished she could.
"Then I don't see why it hasn't done
you more good."
"Why, Mamie," ho patiently reasoned,
"what more good could it? As I tell
you," he explained, "it has just been
my life."
"Then why do you come to me for
money ?''
"Oh, they don't give me that 1" Scott
returned.
"So that it only means then, after all,
that I, at the best, must keep you up?"
He fixed on her the nice eyes that Lady
Wantridge admired. "Do you mean to
tell me that already—at this very moment
—I am not distinctly keeping you?"
She gave him back his look. "Wait till
she has asked you. And then," Mamie
added, "decline."
Scott—not too grossly—wondered. "As
acting for you?"
Mamie's next injunction was answer
enough. "But before—yes—call."
He took it in. "Call—but decline.
Good."
"The rest," she said, "I leave to
you;" and she left it, in fact, with such
confidence that, for a couple of days, she
was not only conscious of no need to give
Mrs. Medwin another turn of the screw,
but positively evaded, in her fortitude,
another visit from that lady. It was not
till the third day that she waited upon
her, finding her, as she had expected,
tense.
"Lady Wantridge will?"
"Yes—though she says she won't."
"She says she won't? O—oh!" Mrs.
Medwin moaned.
"Sit tight, all the same. I have her."
"But how?"
"Through Scott—whom she wants."
"Your bad brother?" Mrs. Medwin
stared. '' What does she want of him?"
"To amuse them at Catch more. Any-
thing for that. And he would. But he
sha'n't!" Mamie declared. "He sha'n't
go unless she comes. She must meet you
first—you 're my condition."
"O—o—oh!" Mrs. MEDWIN'S tone was
a wonder of hope and fear. "But doesn't
he want to go?"
"He wants what I want. She draws
the line at you—I draw the line at him."
"But site ?Doesn't she mind that
he's bad?"
It was so artless that Mamie laughed.
"No. It doesn't touch her. Besides, per-
haps he isn't. It isn't as for you—people
seem not to know. He has settled every-
thing, at all events, by going to see her.
It's before her that he's the thing she
will have to have."
"'Have ' to i"
"For Sundays in the country. A
feature. The feature."
"So she has asked him?"
"Yes—and he has declined."
"For me?" Mrs. Medwin panted.
"For me!" said Mamie on the door-
step. "But I don't leave him for
long." Her hansom had waited. "She'll
come."
Lady WANTRIDGE did come. She met in
South Audley Street, on the 14th, at tea,
the ladies whom Mamie had named to her
—together with three or four others; and
it was rather a master-stroke for Miss
Cutter that, if Mrs. Medwin was modestly
present, Scott Homer was as markedly
not. This occasion, however, is a medal
that would take rare casting; as would
also, for that matter, even the minor light
and shade, the lower relief, of the pecu-
niary transaction that Mrs. Medwtn's
flushed gratitude scarce awaited the dis-
persal of the company munificently to
complete. A new understanding indeed,
on the spot, rebounded from it, the con-
ception of which, in Mamie's mind, had
promptly bloomed. "He sha'n't go now
unless he takes you." Then, as her fancy
always moved quicker for her client than
her client's own: "Down with him—to
Catchmore—when he goes to amuse them,
you," she comfortably declared, "shall
amuse them too." Mrs. Medwin'S re-
sponse was again rather oddly divided,
but she was sufficiently intelligible when
it came to meeting tho intimation that
this latter would be an opportunity in-
volving a separate fee. "Say," Mamie
had suggested, "the same."
"Very well. The same."
The knowledge that it was to be the
same had perhaps something to do, also,
with the obliging spirit in which Scott
eventually went. It was all, at the last,
rather hurried—a party rapidly got to-
gether for the Grand-Duke, who was in
England but for the hour, who had good-
naturedly proposed himself, and who liked
his parties small, intimate and funny.
This one was of the smallest, and it was
finally judged to conform neither too little
nor too much to the other conditions—
after a brief whirlwind of wires and
counterwires, and an iterated waiting of
hansoms at various doors—to include
Mrs. Medwin. It was from Cat chin ore
itself that, snatching a moment on the
wondrous Sunday afternoon, this lady
had the harmonious thought of sending
the new cheque. She was in bliss enough,
but her scribble none the less intimated
that it was Scott who amused them most.
He was the feature.
a he end.

BARL.
The name of the city, called by the
Times " Basel," -which is German, and by
other papers, "Bale," which is French, or
"Basle," which is no modern language at
all, is pronounced by every Englishman so
as to rhyme with "snarl." "Why not spell
it accordingly?
The meekest person who goes to Barl
by way of Miilhausen would certainly
snarl before he got there. Why every-
one should be turned out of the train to
pass through the German Custom-house,
when the train is on German territory for
only half an hour, is incomprehensible to
anyone but a German official. Those who
are going on in the train might be allowed
to remain in it. A Custom-house officer
might walk through if absolutely necessary.
But they are all turned out, ladies or
invalids, old or young. After the solemn
German officials have gazed solemnly
through their spectacles at the handbags,
the umbrellas, the rugs and similar un-
taxed articles, the passengers are solemnly
released and solemnly put back in the
train, the solemn station-master gives the
signal of departure, and within half an
hour they are again, to their great relief,
beyond the frontier of the fussy Father-
land.
Barl is one of those nice, restful places—
like Berlin, or Barcelona, Budapest, Bath,
or Brighton—where the stranger can leave
his Baedeker at the hotel and go out for
an aimless stroll without doing any sight
seeing at all, because, in fact, there are
hardly any sights to see. Berlin, Bar-
celona, Budapest and, perhaps, Bath are
superior in the matter of attractions, but,
as regards rest from sight-seeing, Barl is,
of course, completely cut out by Brighton,
which contains no objects of interest
whatever. However, few large towns
could compete with Brighton in this
respect.
As everyone knows, there is in Barl an
excellent hotel, which Princo CHUN and
his attendants had amplo time to appre-
ciate. For an hotel in a largo town it
has one remarkable attraction. In the
rooms overlooking the Rhino there is
perfect quiet. No traffic over cobble-
stones at daybreak, no belfry next door,
no railway station opposite, no arguing
early in the morning, no singing late at
night. There is a soothing splash of the
water against the piers of the bridge, and
that is all. It has only one defect. The
proprietor does not reckon for unexpected
arrivals. At dejeuner or dinner five
hungry Germans, or ten hungry Ameri-
cans, will suddenly come in, and upset
all the calculations of the cook. Then
ensue fearful pauses. Opposite me, one
morning, sat three elderly Frenchpeople,
two men and a lady. The entre-cote
comes to an end. My neighbours and I
wait twenty minutes till a fresh supply
arrives. Then one of the old Frenchmen,
who has, meanwhile, consumed a large
helping, sees his, and seizes his, oppor-
tunity. "Le plat!" he cries, and has
a second quantity. But when we reach
the cheese, fortune has turned. Then
the Frenchpeople wait, but not patiently.
They are inconsiderate, for Gruyere is
a rare delicacy in Switzerland. Their
lamentations and complaints are inces-
sant. One of the old gentlemen even
claims my sympathy across the table.
"Votis avez ete la victime de Ventre-cote,
monsieur, et moi je sin's la victime du
fromage." But there is no envy between
us now; we are brothers in misfortune.
Away by the train to Paris, which starts
at 10.22. It is there, at the platform, a
quarter of an hour before. In the waiting-
room stand all the passengers, looking at
the empty train, but kept back by one
puny official till it is actually past 10.20.
Then with one frantic rush they are
allowed not quite two minutes to take
their seats for a journey of over eight
hours. Any less stupid people would have
swept away that puny official long ago.
Of all the senseless arrangements of all
the sleepy Swiss there is no arrangement
which reaches such a depth of stupidity
as this one.

LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. II.—The Duke of Donnybrook and Bow.
(Concluded.)
Thky appointed a Commission to report with proper care,
On the possible survival of an unsuspected heir.
The instructions that they gave them were exhaustive and
concise,
"If he lives," they wrote, " just find him, and you needn'tmind
the price.
Through the Continent of Africa your duty you '11 discharge:
It's a biggish stretch of country, so the order's rather large.
Still, the task you 're undertaking is ineffably sublime,
And we don't intend to hamper you or limit you in time.
Pare you well; do all you can, Sirs; and, wherever you may go,
Think of England, think of duty, think of Donnybrook and Bow."
I may spare you the recital of a lot of deeds they did;
And some painful things they suffered in oblivion may be hid.
But I can't forbear to mention that they learnt to speak with
ease
Many queer and tricky lingoes and the dialects of these.
When upset upon the Pungwe they were saved for fame and us
By the opportune arrival of a hippopotamus
Who took in the situation and conveyed them from the wreck,
Clinging tightly to salvation by his rather massive neck.
Then they wandered through Sahara, traced the Congo to its
source;
Took the Niger in a steam-launch, and were wrecked again, of
course;
Did a trip or two from Cairo, where they lingered for a while,
And conversed with all the fellahs whom they found about the
Nile.
They discovered that an eight-oar isn't equal for a bump
To that desert-ship, the camel, with a saddle on his hump,
And that missionary fillet or explorer barbecue
Isn't always used for dinner in the wilds of Timbuctoo.
Their adventures in the forests make a formidable list:
They were shot at by the Pigmies, but were fortunately missed;
And they learnt by having suffered how your courtesy it tries
To be entertained by Bushmen or be feasted on by flies.
Kaffirs, Hottentots and Zulus, Matabeles, Portuguese,
Fuzzy-Wuzzies, men of Benin and the savage Ashantees,
Every tribe they plied with questions as to whether they had met
Any man whose brow seemed fitted for a ducal coronet.
Failure, failure, always failure! And the months went slipping
by,
And no clue appeared to gladden their investigating eye—
Till one day on Lake Nyanza, as they paddled their canoe,
They were greeted by a negro with a cheery "how-de-do?"
When they heard these words in English—oh, the magic of that
tongue!—
All this middle-aged Commission felt at once supremely young.
They approach him, and their Chairman with a joyful eye
perceives
On his chest the ducal birthmark of a strawberry with leaves 1
In his hut he kept his records: all the amulets were there, .
All the marriage-lines and tokens that can make a man an heir;
And they found that, though a black man, he could trace—and
did with glee—
To a line of Dukes in England quite a flawless pedigree.
So they cabled home to London, "We have found the heir alive;
He's greatrgrandson to Lord ARTHUR, and his age is twenty-
five.
We have packed the proofs securely, and shall start with him
to-night.
He has very pleasant manners, but he isn't very white."
The sixteenth Duke of Donnybrook and Bow,
George Alured Augustus Battlemore,
Marquis of Goldstone, Earl of Ballyhinch
In Ireland's peerage, Baron Struachan
In Scotland, and I know not what beside,
Dwells in the Castle that his ancestor,
The Great Red Duke, built centuries ago.
Oh, what a scene that was when he returned
To claim his own and be an English peer.
Rumour preceded him and spread the news,
And all the country-side was set agog.
The tenants all were there, a goodly crowd,
Stout, comfortable farmers and their wives,
Peasants in smocks, and stablemen, and grooms,
And footmen with their well-developed calves;
The Parish Council with its Chairman too,
And all the children from the village school,
The Rector at their head; he had prepared
A long congratulatory address,
And meant to read it to the coming Duke.
At last there rose a shout, "He comes, he comes 1"
And lo! the County Yeomanry appeared
A-clatter up the ducal avenue.
Dragoons they were, a set of burly men
On burly horses—a terrific sight.
Behind them whirled the family barouche,
Drawn by four spanking greys, and in it sat
The Duke, the object of all men's desires.
"He \s black," said farmer H0BBS, "as black as black.
I never seed a Duke like that afore."
But Mrs. Hobbs opined you couldn't look
For everything to please you: there must be
A sort of give and take: and thus to carp
At colour was allying in the face
Of Providence that had restored the Duke.
Then the whole multitude broke out in cheers;
The carriage stopped, and so the Rector spoke :—
"Your Grace," he said—hereat the black Duke smiled—
"We have assembled here to welcome you.
Before the ancient mansion of your race
We greet you, for wo know that you will show
The virtues that have marked your loyal house
In Church and State, and on the tented field.
From that far country where you had your home,
You bring the "here the Rector paused and
coughed,
And grew embarrassed ; he had meant to say
"The white flower of a blameless life," but now,
Noting the ducal ebony, he thought
The words were tactless, so he slurred them o'er,
And passed to other things, and made an end.
The Duke replied—he had been coached with skill—
Leapt from his carriage, shook a thousand hands,
And all men said, "How affable!" and all
Their wives and daughters, as they saw him pass,
Observed his smile and much admired his teeth.
And now, beloved of all, he holds his rule.
Society acclaims him ; he is seen
At every meeting of the Primrose League;
Opens bazaars, and rides to hounds, and shoots.
And though he sometimes shocks the staider folk
With intempestive laughter, or with songs
And dances of a savage character,
These faults are venial, and his neighbours own
They are such eccentricities as Dukes
May use at will, and none the less be Dukes.
P.S.—The Morning Post announces this:
"We are informed a marriage is arranged
Between the Duke of Donnybrook and Bow
And Lady Angelina, only child
Of Geoffrey, Marquis of FrrzALTAMONT.*'

[The author, in attempting to follow Mr. Hall Cains in hi* latest flights
of actuality, wishes to oast no sort of reflection upon any extant Monarch or
Official of State whom he has found it convenient to introduce for the purposes
of Art.]
September 1st.—It was the dawn of a new century, practically
contemporary with the present. By an edict of the young, pale
King EPAMIN0NDA8 I., this unusual event was to be marked
by the inauguration of a colossal scheme for restoring the
Parthenon. A Jubilee Procession to the Acropolis had been
arranged with a view of reviving the splendours of the ancient
Panathenaic festival. All Athens had been notified to attend.
2nd, 3rd.—In the great Square (plateia) of the Constitution
a vast and motley crowd was assembled. Here was the Athenian
Demos, ever ready, as in the days of the Christian Era, to see
something new. Politicians of the cafe (cstiatoria) might be
seen sipping their sweet masticha, or munching Greekish delight
(glukumi) inlaid with pistacchio nuts. In the midst of animated
conversation, they were telling the beads of their secular
rosaries, as occupation for their restless hands. Here were
shepherds from distant Nomarchies, Slavs from Boeotia,
Roumanians from Acarnania, clad in capotes of goat's-hair, or
red vests and baggy trousers, green and blue. Here were
Albanian peasant-women in long shirts with broidered sleeves
and leather girdle, and the glint of sequins in their hair. Here
were local Demarchs swelling with importance; there a street
Arab crying bis sigarocharto (cigarette papers) at 25 lepta, or
about 2Jd. the packet; or a newspaper-boy shouting Ephemeris!
or Astu! (the names of party-organs). There again was an
arebmandrite rubbing elbows with a parish Papa in his conical
hat, long hair and dark gown; and, mixed with these, the foreign
tourist, recognisable by his alien speech and appearance.
4th.—On the balcony of the Prime Minister's Palace, over-
looking the Square of the Constitution, the flower of Athenian
beauty and chivalry had gathered, 'along with the Ministers
accredited from the various European Courts, the Vatican
amongst them. They were greeting one another in terms of
aristocratic familiarity, such as Kale mera (good day), or
ydssou (your health 1) From group to group flitted the charming
Princess Vevifwiski, a Russian blonde with cockatoo plumes
rising from a Parisian toque, now tapping a General of Cavalry
with her lorgnette, now ogling an attache behind her fan.
Scandal was the topic of the hour.
5th.—In an adjoining salon the Prime Minister, M. Raixipapia,
having dismissed his Cabinet and the corps diplomatique, was
now closeted with the Heads of the Army, the Navy, and the
Auxiliary Forces, the Chief of Police, the Mayors of Athens
and the Piraeus, the Directors of the Foreign Schools of
Archaeology, and the Commandante of the Fire Brigade. The
face of the Premier, who was faultlessly dressed with a crimson
peony in his button-hole, was that of a man habituated to
command, and unscrupulous in the methods by which he
attained his ends.
6th.—" You, gentlemen," he said, turning to the Archaeo-
logists, "have guaranteed the stability of the ruins of the
Acropolis during to-day's ordeal, earthquakes excepted; I do
not anticipate a fracas in any other quarter. But,"—and here
he fixed a sombre eye upon the various officials grouped about
him—" at the first sign of disturbance, I have only to fire the
cannon on my Palace-roof, connected with my watch-fob by
the Marconi system, and you will at once block the passes to
Eleusis and Marathon, hock the horses in the fctpposiderodrotm
(tramways), blow up the suburban lines, turn the municipal hose
on to the main squares and streets, and arrest every one who
cannot establish his identity by the name on his shirt-collar."
"Malista, Kyrie (certainly, honoured Sir)," replied tho
officials, as they bowed themselves out backwards.
7th.—Meanwhile, a thrill of tense expectation animated the
brilliant company that thronged the reception rooms. Sud-
denly, up the stairs of Pentelican marble, ornamented with
low prehistoric reliefs, came a penetrating whiff of ottar
of patchouli, followed almost immediately by a full round
figure, with a face radiant as a lark, and dewy as Aphrodite
fresh-risen from the foam. Her smile, which embraced every-
body, including perfect strangers, seemed to permeate her
whole being, from the Gainsborough hat (with its wreath of
natural edelweiss) to the astrachan gaiters, slashed with
priceless ermine.
8th to 10th.—" Dearest Athena!" cried the Priness Vevi-
fwiski, as her rouged lips imprinted a peck, soft as a dove's,
and hypocritical as a hawk's, on the daffodil complexion of the
full round beauty; "mais, mon Dieu, how ravishing a toilette,
and what blooming cheeks 1" She spoke in fluent French, the
invariable medium of expression in the best court circles.
"Who is she?" asked the new English Minister, Lord Tiro,
addressing himself to the Plenipotentiary Representative of
the United States.
"My! Not to know her, Viscount, argues yourself unknown,"
replied General Goatee. "Why, I guess she just walks around
with the Prime Minister and runs this yere Government on
her own. Pro-digious!"
"Ah !" said the English Minister, "she has a past. I saw
that at a glance. But tell me, General, for I am fresh to the
work, what is the nature of the ambitions that govern this
ancient Hellenic race in regard to their political status?"
"Sir," said the American, "I will figure it up for you right
here. Ever since that Cretan business this one-horse Govern-
ment has been afflicted with notions. They reckon to re-
juvenate the Pan'lenic instinct, and start fair again with a
slap-up new Parthenon. In view of the im'nent dissolution
of the Turkish Empire, of which you, as a Britisher, may not
have had any pre-monition, they are pegging out moral claims
on a thickish slab of Thessaly. That's so."
"You astonish me," said the Viscount. "My Government
had given me no information of this contingency. But I shall
have my eyes open."
"A bright man, Sir, this Raixipapia, and no flies on him.
Reads his Byron (not forgetting Don Juan, you bet!) and has
military aspirations, and means to knock sparks out of the
European concert; if only this all-fired Demos don't call his
hand over the olive-tax."
"Ah! the People 1" said the British Minister pensively,
"one has always to reckon with the People where there is a
tradition of democracy." ■
11th TO 13th.—The Jubilee Procession had begun. The van
of the resplendent cortege had already traversed the Street of
Hermes, wheeled by the Church of Eapnikarea, and debouched
on the Square of the Temple of the Winds, heading for the
sacred ascent of the Propylaea.
"Holy Martyrs I " cried Athena, as she leaned her full round
shape over the balustrade, "what a picture 1 See the pro-
cession, how it unwinds its apparently interminable coils amid
the multitudinous populace, and bristles like a gigantic boa-
constrictor threading the countless ripple of the jungle."
In another moment she had forgotten the sequence of her
remarks in a delicious ecstasy of personal detail.
"There's a battalion of Euzoni 1 " she cried in childish glee,
with a flash of her mulberry eyes. "Look at their Albanian
uniform, with the fez, and the embroidered jacket with open
sleeves, and tho full white petticoat, or fustanella, and the red
shoes turned up at the toes. That man with the grimy face is
from the mines at Laurion, where they get from two to twenty
pounds of silver for every ton of lead. And there's the dear
Metropolitan himself in the funny high hat I Fancy their call-
ing the Paris underground railway after him! And, oh, look

There's M. Zola, who writes novels. He's taking notes for' a
volume on Athens. And Mrs. Humphry Ward, too, on the samo
tack. And there's the famous Signorina Marie Corelli. That
makes three. She comes from Stratford-on-the-Avon. Oh, yes,
I was\rought up in England. And, talking of Stratford, if
there isn't the blessed spook of Shakspeare! No, it isn't.
It's the great Master, Hall Caine, with his nice little red
Baedeker, and a green grammar of Modern Greek. He's going
to out-Corelli the Signorina. On dit, there is no love lost
there. And that makes four. All on the same tack. Why, no
more English people need over come to Athens. They can get
it at the lending hibliothekes!"
Her brilliant flow of comment flooded the noontide air, heavy
with the scent of honey wafted from the purple slopes of
Hymettus. At her back there was that constant tittering and
whispering behind fans which is de rigueur in the highest
quarters. Aspasia and Pompadour wore among the allusive
names which passed from lip to lip.
"And where, I wonder, is my dear Anarchist, the Honorable
Dotti? I know I shall lose my heart to him. And I want him
so to sit as a model for Harmodius, or else Artstogeiton, who
slew the tyrant. You know, of course," she cried, throwing a
dazzling glance from her mulberry eyes upon the company,
"that I have been asked by the Board of Works to do a fresco
for the wall-paper of the now Parthenon. You must all of you
come to the private view." The invitation was received with
well-simulated rapture. The Prime Minister had just entered,
twirling his moustaches with a confident air of proprietorship.
14th to 16th.—A quivering vibration passed through the
crowd below, as in a play just before the ghost comes on.
This was followed by a muttering, vague as distant thunder,
faintly audible as a tideless sea. All eyes were directed to a
figure that was climbing up an electric lamp-post immediately
under the balcony of the Premier's Palace. It was Deemster
Dotti. His face was as green as an olive, yet as bold as a
beacon.
"Euphemeite, 0 politai! Citizens, hush your tongues to
holy silence !" he began in the formula familiar to all in whom
flowed the blood of the old Athenian people. "I am not
Demosthenes that I should declaim from the Pnyx; nor the
Apostle that I should address you from the Areopagus: but the
spirit of both still animates me even on this precarious point
of vantage. Brothers, we are to-day the victims of a cruel
farce. Under the guise of restoring the fraternal beauty of an
ancient Republic, the Government, ambitious of a higher place
in the Councils of Europe, is but riveting more firmly the
fetters about your patient necks."
Murmurs of dissent and approval floated up from the multitude.
"Kalo (bravo !)." "Siga (shut up !)." "Go it, cockey!"
"People of the Eternal City of the Violet Crown! It is a
true Republic that we want to restore, the Republic of Man-
hood. Wo want no Kings, no Governments, no Army, no Navy,
no Auxiliary Forces, no Fire Brigade 1 We want no Prime
Minister sucking the People's veins while he toys with the
tangles of a Phryne's locks!"
"Eu! cu!" "To the crows with him!" "Good old
Dotti !''
"Yet let us not move through rapine and violence to noble
ends. Let us simply express opinions. Let us convince by
moral suasion. Let our motto be—For others / Everything for
everybody else 1"
17th.—The peroration, designedly conciliatory, was lost in
the sudden roar of a cannon from the Prime Minister's roof.
This was followed by a terrific explosion on the down line of
the Piraeus railway. Fountains of red blood spurted from the
flanks of their chargers as the mounted police bore down upon
the crowd with fixed carbines. Honorable Dotti had raised his
arm to implore the people not to resist, when a live jet of water

from the municipal hose caught him full between the eyes, felling
him to the foot of the lamp-post.
l&TH.—The brilliant gathering on the balcony had melted
away like snow towards the back-door. As they streamed
through the gorgeous saloons, tittering behind their fans, a
quick ear might have overheard a ripple of society gossip.
"Well, I never!" "Who'd have thought?" What'11 the
boss do with it?" "That's one for the minx!"
As the curtain fell upon this first act of the modern Athenian
drama, the full round form of Athena, her beauty strangely
altered, was lying in the Cabinet Chamber prone across a
despatch-box. The Prime Minister* stood above her, still fault-
lessly dressed and twirling the waxed ends of his inscrutable |
moustaches. . O. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [September 25, 1901.
A TEN DAYS' TRIP.
August in Christiania.—Dining very late, or supping very
early, whichever you like to call it, the energetic tourist (that
is, as energetic as a tourist can be when it is 90 degrees in the
shade, and when he is suffering from perpetual din of wheels
over paving-stones, from the constant sound of tram-whistles,
and, like Sir Henry Irving as Mathias, from "the bells," the
electric bells ringing spasmodically in one's ears) can "put
in" any number of meals between early coffee, regulation
table d'hote dinner at 2.30, and 10 P.M., as during these
intervals he will be jolted about the town in an open
vehicle which thoroughly realises the idea of a "rattle-trap."
The environs of Christiania recall those, to a certain extent, of
Paris towards Auteuil, with an occasional dash of Regent's
Park, the country about Bournemouth, and St. John's "Wood.
The tourist who has been well advised as to the outlay of his
time will probably "drop in," in quite a friendly way, to see
if H.M. Oscar, King of Norway and Sweden, be at home, either
at his palace in the town or at "Oscar's Hall," a little way out.
This last-mentioned chateau is a castellated palace on a small
scale, commanding lovely views, and employing aquaint custodian
who can speak sufficient English to make the explanation of the
pictures and the curios rather like a series of conundrums, and
whose gratitude for a couple of kronin—there were three of
us, and we did it all thoroughly—is so unbounded that, from the
moment ho receives this unwonted gratuity, until he is gradually
lost to our view as we drive away, he positively refuses to
remain covered in our presence, while he continues "booing,
booing, and booing " with all the perseverance of a Sir Pertinax
MacSycophant.
Nor must the traveller miss seeing the old Viking ship: not
that he will be allowed to miss it if Mr. Bennett's courtly
and most attentive cicerone be first consulted; so he needs no
advice from mo; and, if he bo a Cook's Tourist, the intelligent
shepherd, into whose charge the flock of trotters is committed,
will be sure to take him there. Also, whether he "follow the
man from Cook's" or not, he must on no account omit the
trip, per tram, to Majorstuen, and thence, per ascending
electric tram, to Holraen Kollcn, to which place "we go up, up,
up, up," and upper and upper, through grand rocks, skirting,
on one side, pine forests, and, on the other, sheer precipices
suggestive of all sorts of unpleasant possibilities. "Excelsior!
Excelsior!" ascending at a fair rato of speed, ever obtaining
peeps of such landscapes and water-scapes as whet the appetite
for the entire panorama "at a glance," which we are soon to
behold in all its glory on this lovely summer evening, when,
having quitted tiro tram and walked very gently and circum-
spectly up to the uttermost height, wo sit down at one of the
small tables, in the Restauration's gardens, order our much-
needed consommations, and enjoy the grand scene which would
be described in an auctioneer's descriptive prospectus as
"This lovely and extensive panorama."
The neat-handed Phyllis who serves us, and it is to be noted
all the waitresses are neat-handed, tidily-dressed, and most
respectable young Phyllises, speaks English perfectly, and
gives us such information as our thirst, for knowledge and
for cool draughts of hock, requires. The view is entrancing; we
could sit here for any time watching the alternations of light
and shade, the sun cautiously " climbing down," and the mists
gradually stealing up the mountains.
Wortler, too, is, as it were, in the clouds, yearning towards
the setting sun, whose brilliant "last appearance," and "for
this night only !" is evidently affecting him deeply. Mechani-
cally he stretches out his hand towards the hock bottle. But
it is all gone; "'hock' olim mcminisse juvabit." Wortler
sighs; there arc indications of tears in his voice when he
murmurs, "What a glorious evening! I could stay here all
night!" As the practical carrying out of this sentiment
would disarrange all our plans, we recall Wortler from
the ruddy, golden sunset in the skies to dull earth by ask-
ing the waitress for the bill and requesting his contribution
thereto. But he is in no humour for such mundane calculations;
he is for throwing down his purse on the table and exclaiming,
"There's gold for ye; take it!" So, falling in vAtli this
glorious humour of his, we submissively allow him to discharge
in full our indebtedness for the "consommations," adding a
guerdon for Phyllis. Then, with Wortler walking as one in a
dream, we " wander down the mountain side."
On our return to the Eidevolds Plads we look in at
the Tivoli Gardens, where is given, every evening, an
entertainment not so exceptionally different from any other
music-hall entertainment, al fresco or under cover, as to
warrant my recommending a visit to it, unless pour passer le
temps. The National Theatre being closed and under repair,
much to Charlie Wortler's disappointment, we content our-
selves with criticising a statue of Ibsen erected in front of it.
There is also a statue of another eminent Norwegian play-
wright (is it Bjornsen ?) on the other; dramatic Gog and Magog
guarding Norwegian Temple of Thespis.
DOMESTIC ECONOMIES.
(Continued.)
"Didn't I tell you so!" cried Gwen, pointing with triumph
to a greasy ticket stuck in a piece of meat.
"Twopence," I read. "Yes, of course you were right. It's
very cheap and—nasty."
"I suppose it's quite—good?" Gwen queried.
"It appears it hasn't been condemned yet, at all events."
"I wonder if raw meat always looks like that?"
"I rather thought it was red," said I. •
"I thought so too. I wonder why it is so black?"
"King's Road is not the cleanest place in the world, love,
and the denizens of Chelsea have not the cleanest fingers."
Gwendolen turned up her nose. "Let's try another shop."
"Buy! buy! buy!" cried the butcher's assistant. "Wot
kin I do for you, Ma'm?"
It was too late to fly. We were wedged in by a crowd of
Chelsea ladies intent on Sunday dinners and to test in the
approved method of the slums tho quality of their bargains.
The assistant had us at his mercy, and almost before we knew
what had happened, I found myself laden with a large doubtful
mass wrapped in a greasy Star.
"Now for the vegetables," said Gwendolen. The glitter in
her eye betokened that the purchase had roused the genuine
feminine lust for a bargain. Sho had tasted first blood and was
eager for the fray.
Hundreds of barrows lined the King's Road; hundreds of
naphtha flares smoked and blazed and smelt; hundreds of
costers shouted their wares, and thousands of women fought
for bargains. Tomatoes, gooseberries, marrows, peas, bananas,
cherries, currants, potatoes, raspberries—all lay heaped on one
another in boundless profusion, to be had almost for the asking.
A delirious desire to buy up everything seized upon Gwendolen,
and even my sluggish blood was stirred. For half-an-hour we
struggled and haggled and bought, and by this time I was a
walking greengrocer's shop.
"I'm afraid I can't carry anything more, dear," said I,
as raspberries, peas and currants dropped from me on all
sides ; " no, not even that cauliflower."
"It's so cheap," pleaded Gwendolen. "The man says we
may have two for three-halfpence."
Surreptitiously I dropped a large marrow and seized the
cauliflowers. "I think we had better be getting home now,
love," I suggested.
"Perhaps we had." ,
We walked a few steps in silence. "These cabbages
and things are very heavy," I remarked.
"Very," emphasised GWENDOLEN.

Mr. Van Wyck (who has very recently acquired his country seat). "Most extraordinary I
Can't understand it at all! Why, I told my keeper to order a dozen only last
WEEK!"
"Darling, are you tired?"
Gwen looked at me pitoously. Now if
there is an event in the world that 1
dread, it is when Gwendolen gets tired.
Fatigue does not come to her, as to me,
gradually and gently, giving timely
warning of its approach; it leaps upon
her suddenly, from the back, as it wore,
and before she knows it is there it has
knocked her down. Ono moment sho is
all vivacity and "go" — twenty times
more energetic than myself—and the next
sho is collapsed—a dismasted wreck—a
broken reed—a helpless baby in my hands.
"Shall we get an omnibus, dear?"
Gwendolen nodded.
"If wo walk to the Vestry Hall—it's
only twenty yards"
Had I suggested a stroll to the North
Pole, Gwendolen could hardly have looked
more hopeless and reproachful.
"Very well, we will wait hero."
Scores of omnibuses passed us, an end-
less procession of kaleidoscopic colours,
bound for Putney, Fulham, Walham Green,
World's End—anywhere but for our desti-
nation. Gwendolen watched tho advent
of delusive possibilities with intent ex-
pectancy, but as each possiblo blue re-
solved itself into an uncompromising red,
white, green or chocolate, despair settled
more and more pertinaciously on her heart.
At length our own familiar blue appeared.
"Hero it is!" I cried, and began waving
a bunch of carrots at the driver. "Hi!
Stop!" But the stately blue leviathan
held heedless on its way.
"Full!" I murmured.
"Full!" gasped Gwendolen.
It was but a monosyllable, but what a
world of pathos and reproach was in the
tone of it!" Why did you bring me hero
on this dreadful errand?" it said, far
more clearly than if the words had been
uttered; and tho force of it lay in this,
that whilo I might have argued with the
spoken thought, demonstrating that it
was not I who had insisted on coming,
from tho accusation that was never made
I was powerless to defend myself.
It was clearly a case for a cab,for to
arguo with Gwendolen as tho plums,
which had now soaked through the paper
bag she was carrying, dropped one by
one in a sad procession into the gutter,
would have been sheer cruelty.
When'we come to tot up—a rite that is
religiously performed every quarter—we
shall find that I grossly understated the
case against economy. We did not know,
till Augusta told us, that "the tuppenny
mutton never kep', and 'ad to be ot over-
night"; so tho porter had to bo bribed
to bury the meat; the dustman, too, re-
quired a consideration to carry away the
vegetables, and tho cabman to bo com-
pensated for tho cushions on which our
assorted bargains had left a thousand
stains. Moreover, as we had nothing to eat
in the house, we had to dine out on Sunday.
But as I lit my cigar after an excellent
dinner at the Carlton—A.B.C.'s are closed
on Sundays—I remarked that, after all,
economy had its points.
And Gwendolen, pouring her Cognac
into her coffee, endorsed my sentiment.
THAT DOG.
By a Lover annoyed by a Poodle.
I do not like that dog,
Ho sniffs about my heels,
Though I stand stiffly as a log,
Or work my calves like eels.
He has a beastly grumpy growl
Whene'er he sits to beg,
And sometimes gives a ghostly howl,
As though he'd eat my leg.
I do not like that dog,
Despite tho proverb old;
He seems to think that I would jog
His dogship from the fold.
But 1 do love his lady,
The Queen of my delight.
Why was that brutal hound o'er made?
he
Can bark and bite at sight—
1 know it—yet I lovo her. Am I right?

CHEERFUL READING.
In the Bookman of this month we are
informed that "Mr. Rider Haggard's
novel in favour of Vaccination is to have
a reply from the Anti-Vaccination Society
in the form of another novel." To this
pleasing announcement we are not author-
ised to make the following additions :—
Dr. Koch's arrangements for the com-
ing publishing season are now complete.
Ho has engaged the services of Messrs.
Anthony Hope, Hall Caine, and Mrs.
Meynei.L, whoaretocollaborate on a strik-
ing work of fiction entitled The Tuber-
culosis of Timothy. From tho scenario,
already drafted, we gather that the plot
is of the most thrilling interest, and that
the closing chapters afford a dramatic
vindication of Dr. Koch's latest theories.
Mrs. Molesworth's juvenile stories are
always sure of a welcome in the nursery,
and doubtless the two volumes she has
just completed — Matilda's Mumps and
Little Lottie's Lumbago—will bo as popu-
lar as her previous works.
An odd controversy has arisen con-
cerning tho serial publication of a well-
known author's last production. He en-
titled it Temperature 106'.r>, and as it
dealt with the behaviour of a patient in
a high state of fover, the name—if be-
traying some exaggeration—seemed fairly
appropriate. But tho proprietors of The
Perfect Lady's Mirror objected to the
realism of some of the scenes, and in-
sisted both on toning them down and at
the same time on changing the title to
Very Nearly Normal.
Owing to the interest taken by the
public of late in medical matters, impor-
tant changes aro to be made in the
character of the Lancet. Henceforth, it
is to bo issued monthly, with numerous
coloured illustrations. Dr. Conan Doyle
will act as editor, and serials are pro-
mised by Guy Boothby, Dr. Virchow, and
other popular writers. A. C. D.
Mr. Punch's Museum. — " Table of
British Weights and Measures." This
may be regarded in the light of a
practical joko perpetrated upon Anglo-
Saxon schoolboys throughout several cen-
turies, and sanctioned by repeated acts
of Parliament, until the weight of foreign
competition brought the decimal system
into vogue. Note especially the laugh-
able "rod, pole, or perch " = 5£ yards;
the humorous or "dry" measure of
pottles and quarts, and quarters and
quarterns; the comic and ingenious
system of firkins and kilderkins, tods and
weys, Troy and Avoirdupois and Apothe-
caries' weight, and English and French
and Flemish ells, all calculated to produce
hilarity in the course of a business trans-
action. These venerable jeux d'esprit
wero all swept away in the commercial
crash of 1003.
FINANCIAL FOLLIES.

When dividends get sadly in arrear,
It's certain the directorate will hear
That for office they 'ro unfitted,
And in other ways be twitted;
Then the Press is not admitted,
For nothing of the meeting must appear.

as Queer,
And no longer there's hostility to fear,
These Directors so keen-witted
With proprietors are knitted;

Mr. Punch's Museum.—" Toy Jacobite."
One of a small set of curious marionette-
like figures which were used to play
the game of " Nursery Treason," invented
or revived about the year 1890 for adver-
tising purposes. They seem to have
been chiefly in evidence on Stuart
anniversaries, like tho 30th of January,
when their old-fashioned antics some-
what amused the public. They were con-
structed to lay wreaths in the small
hours of that particular morning in Tra-
falgar Square, and to utter the word
"Remember !" with the dark air of con-
spirators. They would curl up at the
mention of Cromwell or Police. If no
notice was taken of them, they would
endeavour to attract it by drawing up a
proposal for tho canonisation of'James
the Second, or the restoration of the
Legitimate Pretender to the Throne of
the Cannibal Islands. They were useful
in Kindergartens to explain the term
"make-believe." This specimen was un-
earthed near a Thames Yallcy backwater.
It is not known what became of the rest
of the set.

"NO P'LICE LIKE HOLMES!"
Sherlock Holmes, by Conan Doyle and William Gillette, as
now being played at the Lyceum, is a first-rate melodrama.
I make the reservation of " as now being played," because it is
possible to conceivo that it might not have achieved so
immediate and so great success had it been in less able
hands than those of Mr. William Gillette, representing
that master of logical deduction, the cool amateur detec-
tive Sherlock Holmes, and in those of Mr. W. L. ABINGDON
as Sherlock's deadly enemy, the creepy-crawly spider-like
king of criminals, Professor Moriarly. Not less excellent
are Mr. Ralph Delmore, as the burly scoundrel James
Larrabee, and Miss Granville in the most difficult part
of the female villain, Madge Larrabee, while Miss Maude Fealy
awakens our sympathy for the mildly vindictive, but much
suffering and interesting heroine, Alice Faulkner. Nor from
the cast must be omitted the light comedy scoundrel, Sidney
Prince, as represented by Mr. Fuller Mellisii, nor Master
HENRY McArdlk'S Billy, whose racy, uncontrollable laughter,
inspired by Mr. Gillette's quiet chuckle, brings down the
curtain on tho final tableau of the second act to uproarious
applause. But for the matter of that, every " curtain " is thus
greeted, though the situation at the end of the third act, being
tho greatest surprise of all, is the one that " brings the house
down," and the house doesn't recover its equanimity until " all
concerned" have reappeared, grouped on the scene of Sherlock
Holmes' triumph, to receive so hearty and spontaneous a tribute
of applause as the oldest playgoer with the best memory would
find it difficult to parallel. It is a drama in which the lights
and shades, not being confined to the situations and the
dialogue (throughout good and individually characteristic), be-
come, as it were, part and parcel (if such impalpable creations
as light and shade can become, "parts and parcels"—but
that's another story) of the auditorium, where at one moment
the audience is in a blaze of light, while the band, under the
skilful direction of Mr. Raymond Roze, keeps everybody merry
with appropriately brilliant music, till suddenly, at a signal
for the curtain rising, all are in darkness! Gradually the
stage-lights dawn upon the house, when "action" commences.
The audience being for the greater part of the evening in the
dark, few of them would come away with a clear and defined
notion of the plot were it not for the "brief synopsis of the
first act " given on the third page of the programme by a kindly
and considerate management. Otherwise, many would be like
"little Peterfcin," in the poem, whose inquiries as to what the
Battle of Blenheim was all about the veteran Casper was unable
to completely satisfy. To adapt his reply to the occasion:
"Why, that I cannot tell, quoth he,
But 'twas a famous mystery!"
And that "s just it. The action carries it triumphantly; it is
a game of hunt the slipper in tho shape of a packet of com-
promising letters inexpressibly valuable to "a very exalted
foreign personage"—whose name is never oven breathed,
and who remains invisible and unmentionable to ears polite
from the rise to the fall of the curtain. Personally, I
should have liked Messrs. Doyle and Gillette to have
given us a fifth act, and to have shown, on the glaciers
of the Alps, or in any other equally mysterious locality, the
realisation of Professor Moriarttj's prophetic threat of ven-
geance; only, of course, such a catastrophe is bound to
happen during Sherlock's happy honeymoon with "sweet Alice,"
and the bride's sudden and unexpected appearance on the scene
would have saved her husband just at the critical moment when
it had become a question as to whether Sherlocfc, or his old
enemy Moriarty, should go over the precipice. "Ce que la
femme veut"—and over would have rolled Moriarty, smash,
crash, bang! while the ever-faithful "Do-you-follow-me-
Watson " would have been seen climbing up with the guides
as his friend Sherlock would once more have fervently embraced
his wife in the gradually expiring lime-light, and the house
would havo risen, for the last time that evening, to enthusias-
tically applaud a grand and thrilling climax.
But perhaps, Sherlock's adventures being endless, another
drama may be up tho collaborateurs' sleeves, with this fifth act
as a finish. It is a good suggestion, as it brings in not only
the principals up to the very latest moment of interest, bat it
satisfies the audience by showing that latest edition of
"Charles, his Friend," in the person of "Dr. Do-you-follow-
mc-Watson," alive and well, to whom, as the confidant of the
great Sherlock, tho audience primarily owe a deep debt of
gratitude, since, without " Do-you-follow-nie-Watson," cleverly
played by Mr. Percy Lyndal, what would anyone havo known
of Slierlock Holmes? For how long Mr. Gillette may be in
possession of the Lyceum is uncertain, but this piece has
certainly come to stay, and at this House our American artistic
cousins have made their Holmes.
THE GOLDEN PACIFIC.
["An American specialist on education has just discovered that anxious
mothers will have no trouble with the most troublesome children if they will
begin by teaching them metaphysics."—The Globe.]
When your little one is teething, just endeavour to explain
The philosophic aspect and significance of pain.
Don't dose him with such quackeries as syrups and emulsions;
There's nothing like a page of Kant or Hegel for convulsions.
Should your youngster bump his head against a table or a chair,
Lo! Plato will convince him that per se it wasn't there;
Ho might believe he felt it, but it wasn't really real:
Your little boy will laugh again—tho system is ideal.
What's physic? Throw it to the dogs 1 But metaphysic still
Contains the sovereign remedy for every infant ill;
So when your babe is querulous and will not take his bottle,
The very best prescription is a dose of Artstotie.

[" The cleverest argument in favour of a return to

the ' art of the needle,' she says: —' It cannot be
denied that a pretty hand, wielding this delicate
weapon; a pretty figure bending over a piece of
work; a pair of bright eyes, thoughtfully, atten-
tively considering the article in hand, have a
charm of their own. The attitude of calm serenity

The country speed along,
I saw her with unlovely zeal
A-practising ping-pong.
And, thought I to myself: "No, she

I saw her canter shyly down
The Row. And from afar
I saw her steering (bolder grown)
Her brand-new motor car.
And still unto myself I said:
"She's not the kind of girl I wed!"
I saw her drive a skittish mare
At Ranelagh, or, drawn
By game less vigorous, make a pair
At croquet on the lawn.
And still I had no doubt that she
Was not the kind of wife for me.
I saw her swimming in the sea,
I saw her in a punt,
I saw her golfing on'the lea,
I saw her dance and hunt.
But still no tremor in my breast
A small, incipient love confest.
I saw her do a hundred things
That might a fellow move,
Things, too, round which some romance
Yet never felt in love. [clings,
She wanted just that little touch
Of coquetry which means so much.
Something each day I saw her at,
But it was not until
I saw her ply her needle that
1 felt a sudden thrill I
Unconsciously I said, "By Jove,
I do believe I am in love 1"
I saw her work! It was too much,
More than I could resist,
There was just that coquettish touch—
My eyes bade her desist.
But, heedless of my mute appcaliugs,
She worked, and worked — upon my
feelings!

THE CRUISE OP THE SABRINA.
Last Log.—The Tragedy of Galway.
Extracts from the Travel Diary of
Toby, M.P.
Killarney, Sunday.—Drove hither from
Kenmare through Windy Gap, above and
alongside the Lakos. The sun shone on
mountain and valley, on the far-reaching
lakes, studded with islands and islets of
emerald green. The low walls of the
roadway are clad with mosses and ferns.
Behind stretch acres of wood-oak, yew,
arbutus, holly, rowan, ash; everywhere
the birch - tree with trunk of polished
ivory and leaves of silver beaten out
to gossamer thinness. Only the horses
didn't care for it. They had on previous
day done their forty miles to Killarney
and back. A second day too much.
Walked up all the hills to save them;
finally undertook to do the last four
miles on foot, waggonette going on with
the Commodore and the baggage.
An hour later came up with horses
fairly broken down. Our destined hotel
two miles off: horses couldn't do another
two furlongs. Luncheon hour long passed;
famished: scouts going out came back
with news of wayside inn. "Not much
to look at," they said. But broken-down
travellers can't be choosers. So wag-
gonette wearily dragged along till we
reached "Mulligan's."
Certainly not palatial in build nor luxu-
rious in appointments. But " Mulligan's"
is no longer the type of the average hotel
in the South and West of Ireland. Next
morning wo went on to one which, in
respect of cleanliness, comfort and cook-
ing, need not shirk comparison with any
in holiday resorts, whether in Great
Britain or on the Continent. In the matter
of reasonable charges it beats them all.
Do not name it, this not being the adver-
tisement sheet. But it rather than " Mul-
ligan's" is the type of the modern hotel
in the beautiful country on whose stately
rocks the Atlantic impotently flings itself.
The railway companies have of late
years wakened up to their opportunities.
No use making costly lines and inviting
the British public to use them in holiday
time if travellers have nowhere to lay
their head at night but on the dubious
pillow of a whitewashed hovel innocent
of ordinary sanitary conveniences. The
great railway company of which, last
session, wo heard a good deal in the
House of Commons at private Bill time,
have taken the matter in hand. At most
of their termini will be found a first-class
hotel where one may live like a fighting
cock (if he has leanings that way) on a
fixed tariff of ten shillings a day.
Qalway, Monday.—Made this place from
Kenmare, calling at Parknasilla, a lovely
place with a fine hotel cosily set in an
inlet of the widely stretched mouth of
Kenmare river; Valentia, with the sweet,
soft air of the Riviera; Ballybunion, where
our Chief Engineer (G.W.R.) inspected
the mono-rail that runs as far as Listowel.
A weird-looking affair. A rail is laid on
trestles three feet oft the ground. On
this is slung, pannier wise, two sets of
carriages, and off we go, doing ten miles
in forty minutes, including one stoppage.
Am told traffic occasionally delayed by
difficulty of balancing weights in either
pannier. If a gentleman of fourteen or
flteen stone gets in on one side, women
and children are weighed to an ounce
or two and packed in carriage on t'other.
Owing to their convenience for this
purpose children are carried at half-price.
Arrival of Sabrina in Ballybunion Bay
created profound sensation. No pier.
Landing a little difficult. Only thing to
do was to .run the gig ashore and then
wade. Fortunately a boat already beached.
Got alongside and scrambled ashore. The
Commodore's progress watched with
breathless interest.
"He's seventeen stun at laste," said a
sympathetic Irish lady with a shawl over
her head. "God bless him I" fervently
responded her companion.
The Traffic Manager of the Mono-rail
regarded him with business eye. Invalu-
able as part of the rolling stock. Put him
in one of the panniers and you might safely
seat two women and a child in t'other.
Save time and trouble in weighing.
"Worth five shillings a day and a
uniform," murmured the Traffic Manager
under his breath.
Don't seem to have anything to do in
Ballybunion. Chief industry to lounge
about the streets — against a wall for
preference. Our descent on the place
gave quite a fillip to local life.
"They 're mimbers of the Government
landed from the gunboat that just came
in." I heard one explain to a friend.
As three out of seven were ladies, this
implied the establishment of petticoat
Government.
Ttiesi/ay.—In dock on a wet day in
Galway. Language does not permit of
picturing equal desolation in eight words.
Just forty-nine years ago another, an
illustrious, member of the little company
that once a week sits down to dinner
round "The Old Mahogany Tree," as it
has sat through nearly three score years,
visited Galway. It was raining then.
"The rain poured down for two days after
our arrival at Kilroy's Hotel," wrote
Thackeray in the Irish Sketch Book. Has
it rained ever since those far-off days
when Mr. Tit-marsh was Mr. Punch's Pat
Contributor? It really looks like it, so
sodden, so sad looking is the town that
once proudly bore the name of the Rome
of Connaught.
Seven hills has Gome, seven mouths has Niltu
stream,
Around the Pole seven burning planets gleam.
Twice equal these is Galway, Connaught's Rome,
Twice seven illustrious tribes here find their home.
The ancient City of the Tribes has
fallen on evil days. Wherever the eye
rests it sees evidence of ruin and decay.
Empty harbour, roofless factories, front-
less houses. Once upon a time, not so
long ago, the sitting member for Galway
resolved to restore its ancient state,
when it was a prosperous port, doing a
fine trade with Spain. The nearest point
of touch with America, why should
Liverpool monopolise the trade? Mr.
Orrell Lever, M.P., answered his own
enquiry by starting a new line of
steamers to America. But the ill luck of
Galway, gathering through the centuries,
stuck to it. One of the new steamers was
wrecked. Another was burned. Funds
failed; Mr. Lever and his big scheme
vanished from the scene.
The wraith of young LYNCH seems to
hover over the town and blast its hopes
and efforts. His story is told to this day
in a tablet adorned with a skull and
crossbones let into the wall of the grave-
yard. It bears record how in the last
years of the fifteenth century Mayor
Lynch's son murdered a Spaniard; how,
found guilty and condemned to death, the
Mayor's wife raised the town and tried
to rescue her son; how sturdy Mayor
Lynch, finding the hangman on strike and
the place of execution in the hands of the
Mother-led mob, escorted his son to a
projecting window of a prison cell and
there, with his own hand, hanged him.
"Very pretty," said the Member for
Sark. "But I'll tell you something
nearer the seat of the cancer than young
Lynch or his wraith. Walking along the
harbour this morning I came upon a man
building a boat, five others, their hands
in their pockets, short pipes in their
mouths, looking on. It was very small
and of unfamiliar build. 'What's it
meant for?' I asked. 'Herrings, yer
honour,' cheerily answered the builder.
'Herrings!' I cried; 'but isn't it very
small to go out herring fishing?' 4 It is
that,' he replied. 'But here in Galway
we've always built boats like this, and
I supposo we '11 go on doing so.'"
AforaJ—but no; it stares out upon the
passer-by at every corner of the old town,
in writing more sharply cut than is the
inscription on the Lynch stone.
Mr. Punch's Museum.—"Piece of Red
Tape." This article formed a large part
of the outfit and stock-in-trade of the
permanent officials of the late War Office
and the unreformed G.P.O. No transac-
tion was considered binding without its
application, and it covered a multitude of
departmental stupidities. It is not to be
confused with the "thin red line" of
the British Army, also obsolete. It was
used to measure telegraphic addresses.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Exhausted by the audacious garrulity of Mr. Hall Caine's
The Eternal City (HETNRMANN), with its cheap guide-book erudi-
tion on the one hand, and its fascinating ignorance of human pro-
babilities on the other, I have found, says my Nautical Retainer,
a most perfect medicine in the refreshing pages of King's End
(Constable), a simple, unlaboured story of New England village
life, by Alice Bhown. Hero is no factitious pomp of melo-
drama, no tawdry bravery to hide the place where the puppet's
heart never so much as begins to beat. We breathe the imme-
diate air of Nature, alivo and palpable. Yet there is nothing
in the whole book that is obvious or unmeditated; each type has
its own fresh piquancy; wo seem not to have met them before,
and yet are never doubtful that
they are to bo met, and well
worth the meeting. It is quite
admirable how, within the so
narrow limits she has assigned
to herself, the author has had
the genius to create characters
so individual, so clear-cut, so
diverse. To English readers of
this book its harmony of humour
and pathos may appeal more ex-
quisitely than to those with
whom t he manner of speech and
life which it reflects is more
intimate. But no one can con-
ceivably resist the charm of the
author's humanity, the strong
reserve of her eloquence, her
instant feeling for the felici-
tous word.
Bagsby's Daughter (Grant
Richards) is notable among
other .things for the creation of
a now situation. My Baronite
is ever punctilious in refraining
from giving away a story by
disclosing its plot. As the
situation referred to is pre-
sented in the first chapter,
the beginning as contrasted
with the middle or end of
things, no harm can be done
by revealing it. The hero by
chance meets the heroine at an
afternoon party, and in the
ordinary course of things is
formally presented. Ho had
never seen her before, nor she
him. At the time of their in-
troduction, they know nothing
of each other. Ten minutes later, iiobert Halifax has asked
Violet liagsby to marry him, and Violet has murmured "Yes."
It seems a little preposterous, but it is a tribute to the skill
of Bessie and Marie Van Vorst, joint mothers of Bagsby's
Daughter, that the bewitched reader accepts tho situation
as readily as did the father and mother of the bride. There
are other surprises in store, compounded and cleared up with
contagious vivacity. Tho Misses Van Vorst are evidently
intimately acquainted with the manners and customs of the
society in the framework of which their story is set. It is,
consequently, a little alarming for those about to marry to
learn that at a fashionable wedding breakfast in Chicago, the
minister who had officiated at the altar having pronounced a
benediction, "his assistants were asked for further blessings,
and at last tho breakfast was served." Old Bagsby, the
millionaire pill-maker, is delightful. Early in his career, his

wife falling ill, he turned his attention to the manufacture of a
really wholesome and effective pill. Successfully trying it on
Mrs. B., ho launched forth in the pill lino, and made a colossal
fortune. That is a case not without precedent. Where P'ere
Bagsby shines is in the fact that, recognising the accidental
fount of his fortune, he set apart one-third of his profits to tho
personal account of his first patient. What do tho Shades of
Cockle and tho Venerable Blue-Pill think of that? In all
matters relating to the social world of Chicago, my Baronite
sits humbly at the feet of his guides. But when they shift the
scene to London he must tell them that a member of our old
nobility may not be indifferently spoken of as Lord Everard
Appleyard and as Lord Appleyard. The two styles indicate
widely different status. As, neither could he invite a stranger
to "lunch at the Marlborough
Club."
The Pocket Poetry Series,
though this is not its title,
issued by John Lane, has re-
cently been enriched by the
publication of a neat little
volume entitled Love Poems by
Landor, of a size to fit into a
waistcoat pocket, left side,
nearest the heart. A lover in
difficulties, wishing to make a
fervid sonnet to "his lady's
eyebrow," and at the same
time to express the unutter-
able constancy of his devotion,
will only have to take a leaflet
out of this little book, couple
its Pegasus with his own jog-
trot animal, drivQ off in his
Landor and pair, and drop his
verses into the nearest pillar-
box. The Baron db B.-W.

"Sample of Air from the
Underground Railway." Care-
fully gathered and bottled be-
fore tho electrification of the
line. Our hardy ancestors ap-
peared to have breathed it, if
they did not hold their noses
all tho time. Recent attempts
at analysis, however, have been
unsuccessful, owing to its
deadly nature, and no demon-
strator has survived the ex-
periment. According to tradition, its constituents are London
fog, coal fumes, train oil, sulphur, marsh gas and stale tobacco
smoke in about equal proportions. No trace of oxygen has ever
been observed.
"Mess or Shell Jacket." This sartorial freak was probably
part of a fancy dress, like the busbies, hussar-jackets, and
other grotesque adornments which appear in old military
prints. It gave to a corpulent colonel or dandified captain
the appearance of an overgrown schoolboy, and, if generally
worn, must have been subversive of gravity and discipline.
"Assortment of London Statues." Collected from various
squares and public places. It has, unfortunately, been impos-
sible to identify them, as the original inscriptions and labels
have been lost, and they all bear a strong likeness to each
other. Prom their pose and expression they would appear to
date from tho darkest period of English art. A. A. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LIVES OF GEE AT MEN.
No. III.—The Right Honourable Adolphus Buffkrtop, M.P.
Adolphus, -when I knew him first, was stout,
Rotund and apple-cheeked, a cheerful boy,
■Within whose trouscr-pocket there reposed
Much treasure garnered from the deuce knows where,
And stored with undiscriminating zeal.
Item, a watchkey, not designed to fit
'His watch, or any watch that mortal knew;
Item, three yards of string, a tangled maze;
Two chestnuts pierced with holes, and so prepared
To break or conquer in the mimic fray—
"Conkers " we called them ere they met the doom
That falls to every chestnut soon or late.
Item, a pencil guiltless of a point;
Two lengths'of stout elastic formed to be
The missile power of his catapult;
The catapult was absent: it had been
Confiscate to an usher weeks before.
An indiarubber ball; three drawing-pins;
Two little slabs of polished cocoa-nut,
Soon to be fashioned by his cunning hand
To anchors, crosses, hearts and things that were
His sister's pleasure and his mother's pride.
Item, a piece of steel—it had a spring,
And some day it was meant to take its place
Upon a pocket pistol, and discharge
Shots at his comrades' calves—you know the kind.
Item, an apple—what, at least, had been
An apple once, but now reduced to core,
Fluffy and brown with age, it had become
The mouldy relic of a ribstone pippin.
One halfpenny and one farthing, and a knife
Broken in blade ; a crumpled paper bag,
Empty, but redolent of peppermint.
And, last, within the utmost cornsr lurked
A lollipop not utterly devoid
Of stickiness: reluctantly it left-
Clinging to life and lining to the last—
Its warm retreat, to be transferred at once
Into its owner's much-desiring mouth.
From these contents, so faithfully set down,
You may infer ADOLPHUS: he was much
What many boys are at the age of twelve.
Take him at fourteen, see him in his class
With thirty other boys, the Lower Fourth.
It is the hour for Caesar ; BUFKERTOP
Cared not for Ccesar; little did he reck
Of Gaul and its divisions, little cared
For marches, camps, attacks and winter quarters.
He saw no use in Latin, and his mind,
Which should have followed Cesar, to the wars,
Strayed to the tuck-shop or the playing field.
On him thus gathering wool an eagle eye
Pounced, and the master's sudden voice broke out
Sternly, "Stand up and construe, BlJFFERTOP."
Oh, luckless BUFFERTOP! He stood indeed,
But that was all; his book was in his hand;
His fevered eye went up and down the page,
Finding nor stay nor comfort as it went.
RUDOE minor prompted him, but all in vain,
And took an imposition for his pains.
Then spoke the master, "'Tis the fifteenth time
That Buffertop's attention is at fault.
Such infamies must cease—one hundred lines!"
"Oh, Sir ! "—" Two hundred," was the swift retort.
"Please, Sir, I didn't——" "Do four hundred then."
"But, Sir, I ""Write eight hundred; and to show
That I will not be trifled with, stay in
For two half-holidays at least, and learn
That inattention brings you misery."
He paused indignant, but the culprit's soul
Was wrung with woe ; down on the form he sank,
And sobbed as though his heart would break, and wiped
With inky fingers both his brimming eyes,
And both his streaming cheeks, a hideous sight.
And even as he sobbed a vision mocked
His aching senses, and he saw the field
Next Saturday, and all the merry rout
Of happy boys, their cricket bats in hand,
Pitching the stumps ; and someone seemed to say
"Where's BUFFERTOP, our champion junior bat?"
And someone answered him, " Kept in," whereat
His heartless fellows laughed, and he the while,
Pent in the hateful class-room, laboured on.
Ah well, he was assured that keepings in
And lines were very dangerous to health.
It might be he would fade away and die,
And then too late his virtues would be known,
And the harsh master who had kept him in,'
Racked by remorse, would pour upon his grave
The tardy tribute of repentant tears.
Too late, too late ! for Bui-'FEUTOP would lio
Cold in his coffin underneath the earth.
His piteous mother would bewail her son,
Crying, "Give back, oh, give mo back my boy!"
And it might chance his father would be wroth,
And send policemen to arrest his foe,
And doom him to the scaffold and the rope.
With this consoled he ceased to weep, and raised
His heavy head, and, lastly, stowed away
His handkerchief, and caine to life again.
(To be continued.) It. C. L.
NEVER TOO LATE FOR AN OLD FRIEND.

thirteenth-century wimple for the head, the whole dating from
the year 1901. It has nothing to do with pan-taloons or pan-
tonine, as has been asserted by certain unsympathetic Saxon
archteologists, who have gone so far as to question the exist-
ence even of a "Pan-Celt." It is said, however, that there
were, about this time, certain renegade English who were
anxious to unlearn their mother-tongue and make antiquarian
exhibits of themselves by acquiring a more abusive and mori-
bund language.

WHIFFLETON'S BOGEY.
(Continuedfrom September 18.)
"So you've noticed that I'd something
on my mind," said Whiffleton, slowly.
"Egad, I should think so," observed
the Colonel. "I don't ask any man to
laugh at my jokes. I pity his lack of
humour—but, dash it all, I don't expect
to be treated as a criminal. Perhaps,
like other men with your income, you
begin to feel the burden of riches. Well,
the cure is simple. There's no need to
stalk about like a melodramatic villain.
We could all do with a better balance at
our banks, eh, boys?"
"We would do anything to make you
happy," put in Gregson heartily.
Whiffleton ordered a small brandy,
then lit a cigar. After this appropriate
prologue, he remarked, "The truth of it is
•—1 'm haunted. Ever since I returned
from Cornwall, I've been haunted day and
night. I can't escape the horrid thing."
"Troublesome matter, holiday flirta-
tions," said the Colonel, gravely. "I
remember in India"
"Holiday flirtations be jiggered,"
interrupted Whiffleton impatiently.
"Women aren't the only horrid things—
beg pardon, Gregson, Mrs. G ex-
cluded, of course. I'm haunted by the
obvious. It follows me everywhere. It
started after a course of magazine read-
ing during my long railway journeys.
It gave me no peace afterwards. When
I began a story, it whispered the con-
clusion. I met a friend, it told me what
he would say. I knew exactly what the
people opposite at table d'hote would chat
about. I foresaw all the Colonel's jokes
when I returned. I knew what every
mother's son of you would say in reply
to my enquiries: 'great mistake, holi-
days' ; 'What, you in town again?' etc.
I rush to the theatre or a music hall,
the thing pursues me there. I open the
papers—" Whiffleton groaned.
"Hullo, Whiffleton!" called out a
jovial looking man at another table.
"Just a word with you if it's con-
venient."
"Coming," said Whiffleton in a tragic
voice. "Shall Itell you what he '11 say?"
he added in a gloomy whisper. "Ho
borrowed five pounds from me last June—
and he's going to say, awfully sorry he
can't square things, but if I make it ton
he's expecting some luck at the end of
the week—well, you know the old game.
Oh, this bogey of mine!"
"Thanks, old chap," said the jovial
borrower, as Whiffleton cams up, "much
obliged for that fiver. Bettor take it
now whilst I have it. Eh—what?"
Whiffleton wrung his hand with wild
hilarity. "You've destroyed it," he said,
"the darned thing's gone! Here, have the
money, take another fiver. Yes, I insist!''
Tho jovial man whistled. "Good dodge
that, though risky," he murmured to
himself as he jingled some small change.

240 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI. [October 2, 1901.
THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A Great Thought for Every Day in the Year.
Second Semes.
THE "ETERNAL CITY" SECTION.
{Continued from September.)
l&TH.—The rays of the afternoon sun fell in rich blotches of
golden glory on the walls of Athena's studio underneath the
Hill of the Demi-Nymphs. Palette in hand, her prehensile Angel's
were rapidly blocking out in the plastic clay the features of the
great Athenian Martyr. As the temperature of her feelings
towards her model had moved up from the zero of hatred to the
boiling point (80° Reaumur) of passionate worship, so the bust
had successively represented Cleon (the brawling demagogue),
Alcibiades, Herodotus, Themistocles, Aristides, and finally
Socrates himself. The work, when accomplished, was to be a
pleasant surprise for the model, who had always been looking
the other way.
20th.—The door opened. "Honorable Dotti!" cried the
butler, and withdrew without comment. The Deputy entered
carrying a large mpaoulo (trunk) heavily padlocked. He gave
a quiet sniff of satisfaction as he recognised the familiar per-
fume of patchouli. Then silently, as if by the force of a habit
which he was powerless to arrest, he stepped to the throne,
wrought of Parian marble and draped with Phoenician byssos (a
kind of linen, not so diaphanous as Coan silk) and assumed a
bust-like attitude with his back to the artist. There was an
expression on hi/3 face. It was the spirit of outraged Justice.
The atmosphere of the studio tingled with suppressed passion.
As the salient features of Socrates leaped into actuality under
her rapid touch, it seemed to Athena that she could not resist
the impulse to infuse some of her own superfluous warmth into
the lifeless clay. Furtively she kissed the Martyr's clammy
nose. It was the connubial instinct. For the moment she was
playing the part of Xanthippe.
21ht.—The silence was broken by Dotct's voice, the relic of
a noble organ ruined by the practice of addressing outdoor
crowds in the teeth of a brutal constabulary.
"Athena," he said, " my soul has learned to trust in your
discretion, and the purity of your motives, ever since that
hour in my bachelor attic when you introduced yourself to me
in an evening dress that displayed the full round ripeness of
your youth and beauty. I will now proceed to read aloud to
you a little thing of my own composition. It is the draught of
a poster giving instructions to the Great Over-taxed how to
behave at our mass-meeting to-morrow night under the columns
of Zeus Olympios. For days they have been coming in from
far and near; not only from Attica and the Peloponnese, but
from the uttermost isles of the Archipelago. I ought, perhaps,
to say that the splendid paradox of the opening sentence is
taken verbatim from the pen of the Master. I have printed the
passage in small caps."
"Go on, Daniel Dotti," said Athena. "My heart is with
you. But don't look round."
The Deputy took a long breath and began. Never had his
face so closely resembled the Bust as at this moment.
22nd.—"Friends, Athenians, Countrymen! THE SKY IS DARK,
THE HEAVENS ARE VOID, WE ARE TRAVELLING BENEATH THE STORM-
CLOUD. Yet it has the customary silver lining. It is the dawn
of the Milky Way, though still no bigger than a man's hand.
Come, then, to the Olympieion in your myriads, leaving behind
your poniards and shot-guns. Let each man ivear his own lutir
with a simple branch of olive twined about it. It shall be at once
a symbol of Peace, and a protest against the olive-tax. Do not
provoke violence. The hired soldiers, themselves your down-
trodden brothers, would be reluctantly tempted to retaliate. Do
nothing, or yon will surely be done by. Simply assemble and talk.
Better still, just listen to me. Respect property. Pay honour
to vested interests. Remember Tliermopylce! Remember Salamis'.
To-morrow after dark; say, about 8.30. . Daniel Dotti.
23rd.—" Beautiful, isn't it?" cried Athena. "And now tell
mo something about your past. I feel I must have met you in
another and a better world." There was a passionate appeal in
her mulberry eyes. "My child," enquired Dotti, "are you strong
enough to bear the truth?" "Try me," sho said. With that,
having drawn down the blinds, ho extracted from the trunk a
phono-cinemato-biograph with oxy-hydrogen lantern complete.
Fixing them in position, he cleared his throat and started:—
24th to 2Gth.—"Constantly harried by the police in my
capacity of Friend of Man, yet never, even in my most rapid
movements—even when my very boots were an impediment—
have I consented to part with this ingeniously complicated
instrument, my sole memento of the noblest Exile I ever
clapped eyes on."
Athena's attention had now become seriously diverted from
the Bust.
"The victim of his virtues, he was placed in what is in-
variably known as domicilio coatto (confinement) on a sea-bound
island. There, loaded with chains, and guarded day and night
by heavy dragoons with drawn sabres, he ultimately perished.
That man was your fatlier!"
Athena's palette fell from her nerveless grasp.
"I now turn on the gas, and both the dead and the dead-alive
will appear. The scene before you represents Trafalgar Square.
Victorious troops from Egypt are marching by. They have just
detrained at Charing Cross. I suppose they must have come over-
land as far as Calais or Boulogne.,. You will notice the Exiled
Philanthropist with a bright little girl and a handsome Greek
boy, the latter holding a stuffed squirrel on wheels by a string."
A sudden tremor passed through Athena's limbs. It shook
her easel, displacing the Bust, which fell nose-downwards with
a thud to the floor. Where it fell, there it stuck.
"The Philanthropist addresses the boy. 'Daniel Leonidas,'
ho says, 'listen to the band!' The drums and fifes are pass-
ing; they are playing The Girl I left behind tne.' The little
maid is speaking to the Philanthropist. 'Papa,' she asks, ' is
dey playing Kingnm turn ?'"
Athena's knees wore going under her. Sho sank down
uneasily on the moist clay of the prostrate chef d'ozuvre.
"I never rightly understood," continued Dotti, "why she
could manage the guttural in the word Kingdom, and yet failed
to pronounce it in the word come. But let that pass. Now the
gentleman hails a four-wheeler. 'Soho!' he cries. 1 What
ho!' answers the cabman. 'So-ho!' replies the Exile with
grave courtesy."
Athena could boar no more. "But surely," she cried, " my
father never made a joke?"
"Not consciously," replied Dotti. "I learned much from
him in that respect. I owe him a great debt."
"But who is the little Leonidas in the picture?"
"Ego o idios (I myself) 1 Dotti is an aiios."
"Never mind, dear," cried Athena. "To me, whatever
your real name, you will never be anything but dotty!" She
smiled shyly at her own jeu d'esprit, and flung herself upon
his answering chest.
* * * * *
27th.—Dearest Husband,—For are we not man and wife in all
except actual fact ?—Ever since you left me at the church-
door at 4 a.m. this morning in a red wig and top-boots, so as to
elude the cordon of detectives, I have been wondering what
you had for breakfast. I say to myself, " Why does he hold
such perilous opinions?" And then I remember that I have
promised to bo your true little help-meet.
All the police are asking one another " Have you seen Honor-
able Dotti?" The crowds are restive and want to go home.
Throughout the night tho troops were raking them with shot
and shell; but the list of casualties is smaller than we anti-
cipated. One milch-goat from the Stadion killed by a

28th.—My Dear Daniel Dotti,— Of course it is splendid having
love-letter after love-letter from you, full of such beautiful
language about the Republic of Man, and telling me how you have
got the greater part of Europe to agree with you. But I was a
little jealous of the Parisian ladies. I feel happier now you are

have foreseen, am soon going to prison for it. I am dying to
have you back; but still, don't you think that Athens may be
a little warm for you? You see, it is only quite a short time

our poor human methods are but as clay or plasticene in the
hands of a Higher Destiny! You hoped to attain your 'end by
peaceful means. I dare not think how long this might have
taken. But now you have succeeded in a moment by the simple

manslaughter ''

I not abjured the guerdon of that—of that regrettable incident?

motto is still Everything for Everybody else. As usual, 1 efface

Epilogue.
80th.—It was a summer evening. Kaspari's work was done.
Beside his cottage door, en the hills above Megara, the fine old
shepherd was sitting in the sun. He had just returned from
Athens, after a one-day excursion.
"Papoiis! (grandpapa)" cried little Petrokinos, "what is
that you have in your pocket, so large and smooth and round?"
"My child," replied Kaspari, "'tis a present from Athens
for a good boy. Tis a bit of the Bust of the great Dotti!"
With that he drew forth a cast of tho lately-discovered
fragment of a portrait head which that day had been set up,
to tho accompaniment of the massed bands of all available
Brotherhoods, on the tomb of Athena in the Potters' Quarter
(Kerameikos).
"Who was Dotti, grandpapa?"
"Dotti, my boy? why that's ages ago, back in the early
part of the twentieth century, before they did away with
Kings and Boundaries, and such-like relics of barbarism."
"Is it a pretty story, grandpapa?" asked the boy wistfully.
"That's a matter of taste, my child," replied the old man;
"but I know it's a d d long one." O. S.
Incorrect.—The phrase, "Mrs. So-and-so presented Mr. So-
and-so with a fine boy, girl, or twins," as the case may be, is
not a happy one, especially in the case of twins. Why should
Mrs. So-and-so present Mr. So-and-so with what is his own?
This isn't the usual idea of a birthday present. And if, per
contra—but—ahem !—that's another story.
Alice at Sea in Yacht Racingland. — " Well," said tho
Carpenter to the Walrus, after they had both been hearing
from Alice detailed accounts in the newspapers of the great
Anglo-American yacht contest: "It ought to be a nailing
good race as there is such a lot of tacks in it."
When affairs come to a deadlock what is the best remedy?
Try a skeleton key.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"THE OLD MILLIONAIRE."
[Parody on "The Old Arm Chair.")
I 'M married; I'm married, and who shall dare
To chide me for ■wedding a millionaire;
I wavered long; though his money I prize,
In other respects the match seemed unwise.
But what could I do—with bills lying there ?—
A warning to wed this old millionaire.
In former years I had hoped to wed
A man I loved—my dear friend Ted!
Yet I heeded the worldly truths that fell
From the lips of my mother, who loves me well.
She said, "No evil will ever betide
A girl who becomes a rich man's bride!"
And creditors taught me I must not dare
Again to refuse the old millionaire.
I watched and I watched him for many a day,—
His eyes were blear'd, and his locks were grey;
And I almost hated him -when he smiled,
While his unctuous manners drove me wild.
Weeks passed on—then he ask'd once more,
That time I said "yes" to the rich old bore;
And learned how much the heart could bear,
After giving my hand to that old millionaire.
'Tis past, 'tis past, but I gaze on him now
With aching heart and with throbbing brow.
Thus I who married for gold alone
Am reaping the harvest I have sown.
Say it is folly, and deem me weak;
When he drops his H's I want to shriek;
But I'm married, I'm married, and cannot tear
Myself away from the old millionaire!
A TEN DAYS' TRIP.
The tourist will have plenty of drives at a very reasonable
charge, and at a very fair rate of speed, if he be so inclined;
his own legs and occasional trams will do the rest; and,
by the way, his own legs will be glad enough in any case to do
a rest when he can find an unoccupied arm-chair or couch.
At our rooms at the Victoria we are so exceptionally well off
in this respect that, once settled down in Victorian armchair,
or at full length on sofa, we found it very difficult to rouse
ourselves up and once again pursue our wild and rattling
career.
The indefatigable tourist will visit Den Eullurhistoriske
Udstillings, which is a sort of National Gallery and Eensington
Museum combined, and can take his midday meal at the
Hestauration there situated, if hunger is a very sharp thorn;
but if it isn't, let him drive straight away to the Restaura-
tion at the Grand, and there take "the order of the day," or
give any other order he pleases, and he will be pretty sure to
lunch well and wisely.
Remember the little steamers in Piperviken Bay for short
excursions; also the larger steamer that takes you about the
islands between 4.80 and 7 o'clock of an afternoon. Finally,
"when in doubt," "play your trump card," i.e. Mr. Bennett,
whose shop, full of Norwegian curios and all sorts of souvenirs
to delight children, you will find at No. 35 Carl Johans Gade,
not three minutes' walk from, and in a line with, the Grand
Hotel, which is apparently to the English and American
tourist " the hub of the universe in Christiania." Should Mr.
Bennett himself be invisible, his amiable representative (all
that there is of him—which is about six foot three) will attend
to you and put you in the right and the best way of doing
everything and of going everywhere at the least possible
expense compatible with perfect comfort.
A delightful two days and a-half return voyage to England.
On arriving in the Thames, not daring to face tho vacant streets
of London, broiling under the rays of an early autumn sun or a
late summer one, which is much the same thing, we debark at
Tilbury, bid aw revoir to our gallant Captain, and, after wait-
ing about an hour or so, watching nothing in particular,
La Marguerite comes alongside. We are inclined to follow the
example of the mariners in the old "Bay of Biscay" song, and
"hail her with three cheers," but we restrain our enthusiasm
and go quietly on board. A lovely day ; some hundreds swarm-
ing in by train, pouring into the ship, and stowing themselves
away in all directions, treble-lining tho side nearest the landing
stage, but all settling themselves down comfortably as we get
under weigh.
A pleasant trip by the lovely Marguerite to Ramsgate.
Average bourgeois lunch en route. (I have tried it since.
'Tis always good, but monotonous.) Personally I should not
select the Marguerite for the society of its passengers. Am
quite content to imagine what a nice, quiet, "say-nothing-
to-nobody-sort of" set they will be on the return voyage.
However, trippers will be trippers, and tipplers will be tipplers.
Ramsgate at last. Happy thought.—Let us keep up the idea
of still travelling about, and dine at the Hotel. Carried,
nem. con. A well-served dinner at the Granville, in company
with our capital travelling companion, Charles Wortler,
winds up the Norway holiday just in the right way. We drink
to our next merry meeting and voyaging.
The next day.—The nostalgie of the sea being upon us, we
continue being nautical by going aboard one of the taut and trim
little steamers in the S. E. and L. C. & D. service, plying this
season merrily between Folkestone and Ramsgate, aller et
retour. We make several pleasant runs over to Folkestone and
back, distributing our favours between the Imperial Hotel below
and the Metropole above, and by exercising "the wisdom
of the wise," (here's a health to John Oliver Hobbes!) we do
ourselves very well at both establishments. This little steamer,
if its running is continued next season, is worth attention;
six hours at sea, allowing two and a-half ashore, coasting all
the way, and stopping at the two intermediate ports. More
sea breeze benefit than can be obtained during a shorter voyage
on a bigger ship, and not a third of the expense! When found
make a note of it! And thus, after our Norway outing, do
we, speaking for self and the partners of our voyaging joys,
let ourselves down gently; then gradually extending the
intervals between the sailing excursions, we reduce them to
one in the week, and by that time the year's brief holiday
is over.

"PHOTOGRAPHS."
One used to think a Photograph -was honest as the sun,
The acme of veracity, sons bias,
But that was in the early days before it had begun
To follow in the steps of Ananias.
One saw a view of sunlit sands, and dreamed the sky was blue,
The colour of the waves an emerald green,
And if what one imagined didn't happen to be true .
One simply blamed one's fancy for the scene.
But now, in brilliant colours, they produce a photochrome,
That really out of Fancy takes the shine;
One thinks Virginia "Water is a bit of Ancient Rome,
Or mistakes the Thames at Shadwell for the Rhine.
When a girl was very pretty—vivacious or demure,
In days before photography was known,
'Twas only in a miniature her portrait you'd secure
And a wonderful resemblance would be shown.
You'd recognise the maiden with her dainty air of grace,
The lilies and the roses on her cheek,
The hair, the eyes, the attitude, expression of the face—
The picture could do everything but speak.
But now outside a theatre you perceive a mighty frame
Of photos from the Chorus to the Star,
And can you trace the likeness, altho' they put the name
To tell the British public who they are?
What charming views they forward when a villa is for sale,
And p'raps for further details you have sent,
By woodlands 'tis surrounded, or 'tis in a fertile dale,
And, as the agent puts it—" Why pay rent?"
The entrance looks so spacious and the carriage sweep so
grand,
And every room's so lofty and so wide;
There's a lake and there \s a paddock and a lot of meadow
land;
To buy it, from the photos, you decide.
Alas! the shameful swindle of the camera again,
For disillusion comes when far too late,
It is pokey, also stuffy, p'raps the roof lets in the rain,
And you could not get a go-cart through the gate.
In illustrated papers, where the interviews appear
With some Continental beauty when chez elle,
Duplicity of photos is phenomenal, I fear,
Regarding that most charming demoiselle.
There's a corner of her boudoir, of the salon there's a slice,
A vista of a glasshouse full of flowers,
A pond within the garden where she skates when thcro is ice,
A kiosk wherein she spends the sunny hours.
The camera's a liar! and we '11 let it go at that
(Tho' letterpress is also far from true),
For this palatial mansion is an ordinary flat,
And the photos give a quite ideal view!

"My dear, shall I tell the porter we
wish to sub-let the flat?"
"If you would occasionally have an
opinion of your own on some subject,"
remarked GWENDOLEN in a tone of icy con-
tempt, "you would be so infinitely more

Seeing that an amiable alacrity to fall
in with any and every suggestion was not
enough, and that GWENDOLEN was deter-
mined 1 should take an intelligent interest
in the approaching discussion, 1 settled
myself in an easy chair and lit a cigar.
"Living in London is so terribly ex-
pensive." %
"Yes," I agreed, glancing at a
milliner's bill which had just made posi-
tively its last appearance.
"You see," continued Gwendolen,
divining my thoughts, " one can dress on
nothing in the country. A cycling skirt
and a sailor hat"
I pulled a long face; but the opportunity
was not to be lost. "And I, of course,
would wear a flannel shirt," I interposed
casually. Gwkndolen is most particular
about my linen.
"Mm—yes," she replied, doubtfully,
"well, when you are digging in the garden
perhaps. Of course, wo '11 do all our own

cise for you, and we shan't be able to

tables! Living will cost practically
nothing. Why, the butcher's will be the
only bill we shall have to pay!''
"Or leave unpaid," 1 suggested.
"Then cabs—1 'm sure we spend quite a
small fortune on them, and there aren't
any hansoms in the country."
"Nor theatres."
"No, nor suppers after them," added
Gwkn, with just a suspicion of regret in
her voice.
"Well, my dear, that will save us no
end of money. Then, we shan't have to
entertain."
"No, dear, there'll just be our two
selves. And you 'II l>e able to give up

you know you do nothing at the club but
stand drinks to budding journalists more
impecunious than yourself."
"The budding journalist of to-day may
be the full-blown editor of to-morrow," I
remarked.
"In which case you hope he will
rememl>er the whisky-and-watering you
gave him in his youth? No, <lear, you

up my sleeve and patting the puny white
arm she discovered, "it shall grow as big
and brown as a navvy's. And as for my

"Really, Gwendolen"
"Did I tease it? Oh, Jack! wo shall

Young Lady. "Oh, Mk. Green, I don't know what to do with Effie! She is bo miserable because she hasn't had her
DONKEY RIDE. WOULD YOU MIND GIVING HER A PICK-A-BACK?"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Queen's Comrade (Hutchinson) is Sarah, Duchess of
Marlborough, whose life and times Mr. Fitzgerald Molloy
pictures in two handsome volumes. The work is a valuable
contribution to the knowledge of the history of a stirring period.
The Duchess lived through six reigns, playing a prominent
part in the majority of them. Mr. Molloy begins at the
beginning, when Sarah Jennings, the budding Duchess, was
appointed Maid of Honour to the Duke of York's bride,
the hapless Princess of Modena. The Duke (in course of
time James the Second), forming his household as heir-
apparent, promoted his former page, John Churchill, to
be Master of the Robes. At a ball given by Charles the
Second in honour of the new Duchess of York, young
Churchill saw Sarah and straightway fell in love. She treated
him with persistent coquetry, an attitude that only inflamed
his ardour. Mr. Molloy quotes many letters written by
Churchill before and subsequent to his marriage, all breathing
unfaltering affection. Faithless found in other quarters, he
was, to the last, faithful to his first love. Among many episodes
of enthralling interest, the invasion of England by William op
ORANGE and the flight of King James is not least. The
story is mainly told from the letters of those who made the
history. Abandoned by one daughter, assailed with armed
force in the name of another, deserted by his trusted generals,
with his protigi John Churchill in the van, feebly trustful,
futilely irresolute, King James cuts a pathetic figure. But my
Baronite is constrained to say that kings and queens of this
final Stuart era, pimps and paramours, were a poor lot.
What a splendid-looking book is this tenth volume of The
Anglo-Saxon Review for this quarter, edited by Lady Randolph
Churchill, and published by Mrs. Cornwallis West at 49,
Rupert Street. Two charming ladies rolled into one. Such a
volume ought to be replete with articles de luxe. It opens
with a delicate reproduced engraving of Sir Thomas Lawrence's
well-known portrait of the lovely Lady Blessington, about
whom there is an interesting article by John Fyvie, who
styles her Ladyship "the Gorgeous." The Baron does not
approve of the epithet, preferring, "Beautiful Blessington."
Mr. FYvrE's memoir is most interesting. The Baron, having
only quite recently received The Anglo-Saxon, must possess
his soul in patience until from his much-occupied time a fair
proportion can be spared for further consideration of the many
articles with most attractive titles. THE BARON DE B.-W.

THE SMILE CURE;
Or, No Laughing Matter.
(A Very Serious Story.)
Chapter I.
During the last eighteen months busi-
ness with Arthur Jollifer had suffered a
general depression. Being susceptible to
commercial influences, it was only natural
that Arthur should share the depression.
It was particularly unfortunate that a long
streak of commercial prosperity should
suddenly evaporate — immediately after
his marriage. Enid was a splendid girl,
plucky, light-hearted, and all that, and he
felt that his silent brooding over bad
times was unfair to hor. He ought to
make an effort to simulate an air of
cheerfulness—at '.east at home. He must
throw off the shroud of gloomy foreboding.
He must pull himself out of himself, and,
generally speaking, buck up and be
sprightly. Dinner each evening was
becoming a rather dismal affair. It must
bo altered. "Dash it all," said Jollieer,
pulling a daily paper from his pocket, " it
isn't fair to her."
As he said this to himself his eye caught
the following paragraph:
"We have had many strange cures from America,
and the latest seem? to be the smile cure. A well-
known doctor of Minneapolis issues the following
pretcription: 'Smile, keep on smiling, don't stop
smiling.' This is said to be useful for melancholy
patienta."
"By Jove! Just the thing. I '11 adopt
the cure. Don't stop smiling. I won't!
I will cure myself, by Jove, for her sake!"
Chapter II.
Now it so happened—so much stranger
is truth than fiction—that the day on
which Jor.LiFER had registered the firm and
unbreakable vow recorded above had been
a very unfortunate one with Enid. To
begin with, her presentation pup (from
workers of Walthamstow) had attacked a
tradesman in the vital parts of his con-
tinuations, for which compensation would
have to be made. ■ This was in itself
annoying; but when the man became
abusive (after the pup had been tied up),
and threatened to shoot the "animal,"
and have Jollifer imprisoned and Mrs.
Jollifer fined, and "get all their names
in the paper," Enid began to despair.
Then the cook, " a perfect treasure," gave
notice. At four o'clock Enid cut her
linger. At half-past six the curling-irons
got over-heated, and a little rod burn
began to throb and smart beneath the
curls on Enid's troubled brow. Alto-
gether this chapter may be not
inappropriately called one of accidents,
notwithstanding that we recognize the
appellation as an old friend. But wecau't
all be original.
Chapter III.
Jollifer, who did nothing by halves,
started rehearsing a soft, ingratiating
smile directly he left the office. To tired
and morose gentlemen wno travelled
towards their suburban homes on that
evening JOLLIFER was a source of no little
irritation. As he put the latch-key in the
door a beautiful beamy expression came
over him. It was a really exhilarating ex-
pression of supreme innocent delight, and
would have established a reputation for
permanent good nature among the most
polished of amiable shopwalkers. Jollifer,
as we intimated, did things thoroughly,
and: in mercantile parlance we may
without exaggeration affirm that a steady
and assiduous application to the business
of risibility in all its ramifications had
furnished him with a most efficient and
workmanlike article.'
Chapter IV.
Enid was greatly disconcerted by the
complaisant smile that overspread the
countenance of her husband as he sat down
to dinner. She had anticipated a rather
gloomy atmosphere in which to parade her
misfortunes. She waited until ARTHUR'S
mood was more in sympathy with what
she had* to tell him before she spoke.
But Arthur's mood was not of a change-
able quality. A broad and generous
smile illumed his face and gave every
indication of being a permanent fixture.
This was so unusual that Enid became
nervous. But she reflected, "Ho's in
such a good humour I think I might try
him with the cook." So, in a plaintive,
appealing manner, she told Arthur that
the "treasure" had given notice.
Arthur was intensely amused. There
might have been a lurking suspicion of
annoyance for a second, the cook was a
treasure. It was intensely aggravating,
but Arthur clenched his fists and gave
vent to a series of merry chuckles.
"We paid fifteen shillings in Registry
Office fees," said Enid, "and wc shall
never get another."
Arthur knew it was true, and a smile
mellowed on his lips.
It was something of a relief to Enid
that he took it so well. She had expected
an outburst. It gave her courage to
mention the puppy incident. In tremulous
syllables she did so—fully. It seemed at
first as though the pup would be immo-
lated on the altar of Jollifer's wrath.
It was not his first offence; he had been
warned. But when the story was told,
Jollifer gripped his chair with both hands
and—burst into a peal of hearty laughter.
"Dogs will be dogs," he said, "only natu-
ral—serve the tradesman right," pointing
each phrase with an ebullient smirk.
This was capital. But it hardly pre-
pared the way for the cut finger, for which
a great deal of sympathy was anticipated.
Enid had kept it in case Arthur should
threaten to get rid of the pup, or storm
because the cook was leaving. He had
taken both like an angel. Consequently it
had a strange superfluity. However, it
was held up and commiseration cordially
urged on its behalf.
Jollifer treated his expectant wife to
a magnificent series of cordial smiles.
"Arthur," urged Enid, "aren't you
sorry ?''
"Awfully, darling," he replied, with a
crisp chuckle.
Enid stared at him in amazement and
then burst into tears. Jollifer was not
a man to break a resolution once having
formed it, so the more his wife cried the
more he smiled. Finally, Enid left the
room. The puppy, not knowing quite what
was going on, approached Jollifer for a
caress, and was promptly kicked from one
end of the room to the other. His yowl
brought Enid back again, and she made a
second exit with the pup under her arm.
Jollifer became a little uneasy as to
the entire success of his smile-cure. Ho
wondered if he had followed the direc-
tions correctly. As he pondered over
what he had read the front door closed to
with a bang. He rushed into the hall.
"Where is Mrs. Jollifer?" he asked
of the maid.
"Gone to her mother's, Sir—with the
little dog, Sir 1"
Jollifer felt that this justified him in
bringing his resolution to an end, so he
stopped smiling and looked dangerous.
Then he took a cab and followed his wife.
At twelve o'clock that evening he was
still explaining matters.
Jollifer's next role is Henry the
First, the gentleman who "never smiled
again."j W. H. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
A MUCH INJURED MAN.
Chapter I.
Now, in telling this story, I don't want any one to run away
with the idea that I'm one of those conceited asses who think
themselves absolutely irresistible with women. I don't exactly
think that; but really, I fancy 1 know something about the sex.
My friend, De Thode, said to me the last time he came to borrow
a sovereign, "By Jove, old man, you are a deuce of a fellow
amongst the ladies!" Well, that's DE TlIODE's idea—not
mine. However, he may be right. I really don't know, and
offer no opinion on the subject.
This is merely preliminary to my story. Briefly put, it is
this. I had heard from my Uncle, that Miss ACRESBY, the
groat heiress, was going down to the Blazeaway country to
hunt, last season, so thought I might as well send my stud down
there, especially after my uncle had given mo a hint that he
was rather tired of seeing me a bachelor. Thought I might
hunt the heiress and the fox at one and the same time. Funny
fellow, my uncle. Of course, he's very fond of me, but he
put the matter rather crudely when he said:
"The best thing you can do is to marry some fool of a girl
who '11 keep you, for I '11 be past-participlcd if I '11 do so much
longer!"
So I sent down my stud-groom—I 've only one groom at
present, but I call him my stud-groom—to take rooms for me at
"The George," Splashington, and stabling for my stud—I've
only one horse just now, but I call it my stud—and after
getting a plentiful supply of good cigars (on credit), and a few
other necessaries, which I told them to put down to my uncle,
just as a matter of form—I toddled down next day by the fast
train to Splashington; my stud-groom met mo with a cab at
the station, and I drove up to "The George."
The rooms were fairly comfortable; and after I'd had some
of the furniture taken out, and a sofa brought in from the land-
lord's own apartments—always And it necessary to recline for
an hour before dinner—I proceeded to settle myself, leaving
my fellow—the stud-groom—to unpack my things, discover the
address of Miss Acresby, fetch me the local paper, and trace
out my route, on the map, to next day's meet. Young Gadsby,
who knows everybody, dropped in late in the evening, and we
chatted about the prospects of sport, both with the fox and the
fair sex, till nearly midnight. By Jove, Gadsby does possess a
thirst! The beggar drank six whiskies and sodas—I only took
five, because I wanted to be in good going order for the next
day. Just before he left, he said, " Well, if you want an intro-
duction to the heiress, I'm your man. 1 '11 do it to-morrow, at
covert-side." I think I said it was deuced good of him, but I 'ni
not quite sure; anyhow, that's what I meant to say, but really
I felt so—tired—that that's all I remember.
Can't think what made my head ache so awfully the next
morning. Deuced strange, because I'm always so careful what
I drink overnight. If it had been Gadsby, now, I shouldn't
have been surprised.
Got up and felt rather better after my tub. My stud-gr—
my fellow, I mean, valets mo awfully well, I must say. After
he had helped me dress—I'm not conceited, but the " pink"
rather suits me, I fancy—he said that the meet was at Bolington
Cross-roads, about four miles out of the town, and that my
stud-groo—that he, I should say, would have my hunter ready
at 10.15. I went down to breakfast with a sort of feeling that
I didn't care so much about hunting as I thought I did. Don't
know how it was: the headache, I suppose. Horrid meal,
breakfast. Drank four cups of tea, but ate nothing. From
my window I saw lots of fellows pass, on their way to covert.
Didn't think 1 should hunt that day: felt rather more inclined
to potter about and trot out the heiress. My hunter was
brought round punctually, and a quarter of an hour later—for 1
rather like to watch j ny horse paraded up and down, whilst
the small boys stand around gaping, and making admiring
comments—I went down and mounted. Had to have ail tho
tackle re-adjusted—girths tightened, stirrup leathers let down,
throat-lash drawn up: it's really never safe to leave these
things to even tho most accomplished stud-groom; one always
knows so much better oneself.
I found that, with all this delay—so stupid of my fellow—
I had got a bit behindhand, so I had to gallop my horse
along a hard road the whole four miles to the meet. That's'
enough to make any fellow swear at his,stud-groom, isn't it?
However, I got to Bolington Cross-roads just as hounds were
in the act of moving off, and fell in with the ruck of horsemen
going down a narrow lane. There were two ladies riding just
ahead of me, both magnificently mounted, and on them my gaze
became immediately fixed.
>>ow, I fancy I know something about horses. And I should
be well under the mark in saying that neither of those two
splendid animals could have cost much less than three hundred
guineas. Just as I was twisting up the ends of my moustache
before coming into the range of vision of these ladies, Gadsby
dropped back to speak to me.
That fellow's six whiskies overnight hadn't affected him a
bit!
"Morning, old chap," he said to me with a grin, " you were
a bit—tired—last night, weren't you?"
Now, I didn't seo what that had to do with Gadsby, so I
answered in rather an offhand tone:
"Oh, a little. Who are the ladies on in front?"
He dropped his voice as he answered:
"Ssh I—that's the heiress—that's Miss ACRESBY."
"Which ?" I asked, "the one on the chestnut?"
"No, the little dark-eyed woman on the brown mare."
This was rather a disappointment to me. I should so much
have preferred marrying the tall, fair-haired girl on the chest-
nut. However, as I could not help it, I bowed to the inevitable
—I am a bit of a philosopher—and made up my mind that I
must take tho brunette.
"Introduce me, Gadsby," I said, with an air of resignation
which I hardly felt. But I always look at the bright side- of
things, and I thought I should probably find the girl pretty
tolerable. After all, one woman is so much like another, and
they are all so vastly inferior to the male part of creation that
—provided, of course, she has money, one may just as well
marry A. as B. De Thode has on many an occasion said to me,
"My dear Maximilian, a man of your calibre ought to marry a
Duchess—but in the astonishing topsy-turveydom of the world,
I daresay you '11 end by simply carrying off some rich com-
moner." It looks rather as if De Thode is about to prove him-
self a true prophet. Well, never mind her want of title: the
woman is always raised to the man's level: he is not dragged
down to her's. When I marry her, she will become a Boun-
eerby, and that is good enough for me. The Bouncerbys
came over with the Conqueror—-so'De Thode tells me.
As soon as hounds had been thrown in to covert—I flatter
myself I know something about hounds, and determined that"
on a future occasion I would give the huntsman a gentle hint
that he was not going the right way to work in drawing his
coverts—Gadsby" motioned me up alongside him, and riding
over to where the two ladies sat in their saddles, he raised his
hat and said:
"Allow me to introduce a particular friend of mine, Mr.
Maximilian de Verb Bolxceuby, who has just come down to
hunt with these hounds."
The little woman with the dark eyes at once commenced
talking in most animated fashion to me. Now, I fancy I know
something about women, and I can't help saying that she made
strong running from the first, probably to cut out her cousin,
the fair-haired girl, who only accorded me a somewhat stiff
bow. Shy, very probably, I thought. F. R.

The plot of the story seems to have been on this wise : A and
B, it is alleged, damage C's fence at Broadstairs; C, hatless,
pursues A and B to Ramsgate (a distance of about two miles
and a-half, without coming across a constable), where, on
arriving, he blows a police whistle in order that "the watch"
may arrest A and B. The watch, however, represented by Chief
Constable aforesaid, arrests the hatless and injured C. The
hatless and injured, always good-tempered and polite up to a
certain point of forbearance, when it appears he used a naughty
swear word, on subsequently receiving notification of a sum-
mons having been taken out against him, consulted his solici-
tors, who wrote a sharp "lawyer's letter" to energetic Chief
Constable, which that eminently facetious official treated "as a
joke," for how possibly could any threat of proceedings against
the representative of Law and Order, in the execution of his
"dooty," be anything but a joke?
However, the defendant's hard-headed lawyers, unable, appar-
ently, to enter into the humour of the thing, insisted on tackling
the Chief Constable, who thereupon, following the example of his
Shakspearian prototype, called together the "Watch" Com-
mittee, and left himself, so to speak, in their hands. Hence
the employment of that eminent K.C., Mr. Kemp, to come down
from town and undertake the prosecution of Mr. John Warren,
charged with " sounding a noisy instrument, to wit, a whistle,"
and "so collecting an assembly," &c, &c.
The Worshipful Mayor and thirteen Justices assembled in
terrible array to do justice in the King's name. Now, though
Orummer was represented among the constables, yet the
Magistrate, Mr. Napkins, not being impersonated by any of
the Justices, was a deficiency in the cast that rather detracted
from the humour of the scene, although on one occasion the
Worshipful Mayor did venture on an astute Nujilcins-y sort of
question as to whether "if a certain act were committed in
Broadstairs, would tho Ramsgate police bo justified in arrest-
ing?" This most pertinent and far-reaching conundrum was
curtly quashed by Mr. Abrahams, who, showing a strange lack
of humorous appreciation, replied, "I don't know, and it does
not matter a bit, if I may respectfully say so!" Heavens!
This to the Mayor! The "if" was a saving clause, and
the thirteen magistrates must have breathed again.
However, the whole thing was pooh-poohed, Dogberry-Jones
was Jiot "wery much applauded for what he'd done." But he
was not "severely reprimanded" by the Bench of magistrates,
as they evidently did not like to be hard upon one of their
own officials, who, after all, had perhaps afforded themselves
and the applauding public more genuine amusement in a quiet
way than they had enjoyed for a considerable time. So, at the
request of Counsel for the defence, the defendant's whistle was
restored to him, and the Chief Constable, as he left the Court,
probably exclaimed, "Oh, blow it!"

"P/ionographtc Record of a

and date (1901) of this exhibit
are beyond question, but of
its authenticity there is some
doubt, certain students of
phonetics maintaining that the
noises emitted could only have
come from a farmyard or a
cattle-show, and not from an
assemblage of human beings.
They allude with some justice
to the hissing of geese, the
hooting of owls, the yapping
of dogs, the booing of bulls,
and similar animal cries. We
leave the title, therefore,
subject to revision.
"Photograph of Butcher's

exhibition of uncooked flesh
and slaughtered animals
which was quite common all over
London until well within the twentieth
century. It was allowed to regale the
eye and other senses of passors-by in
the open street, as will be seen from
this excellent reproduction in all the
original tints. The scene is ono of
the poorer quarters of the Metropolis
on a Saturday night, when such
establishments were specially active.
By the Slaughterhouses and Knackers
Regulation Act of 1910, displays and
entertainments of this nature were
no longer permitted in public thorough-
fares.

"This be t' sleepin' room an' this be t'
kitchen," explained the old woman who
showed us over a cottage to which a
thatched roof covered \vith green moss
had attracted us.
"Charming!" cried Gwendolen. "I
do so love these red-tiled floors. And is
that the scullery?"
"Scoollery? Theer bain't no scoollery."
"Then where do you wash up?"
"Washoop? Theer be a poomp down
t' village"
Gwendolen's face fell. "Then I suppose
there \s no bath-room?"
"Baath-room? What be that?"
"My dear," I interposed, " you can't
expect all the luxuries for five pounds
a year."
"Luxuries! 1 thought everybody had
bath-rooms in these hygienic days. There
isn't even water in the house"
"Except what comes in by the roof," I
corrected, pointing to a glistening shimmer
on the walls.
"It certainly smells damp," said
Gwendolen. "Oh, I don't think we need
trouble you to show us upstairs. Thank
you so much! Good morning!"
"Our books would have got ruined
ther^-, Jack."
"And our constitutions, too."
"It would b3 cheaper in the end to pay
a little more."
"Undoubtedly."
We spent several woeks cycling through
the country, inspecting all sorts and
conditions of cottages. A few were too
large, most too small, and all too hopelessly
inconvenient; while those with any
pretensions to beauty were ready to fall
about our ears in picturesque ruins. One
little place we did discover which all but
came up to our ideal, but the "large
garden" which the local agent assured
us it adjoined turned out to belong to
the big house next door. I looked at the
narrow strip of nettles in which it might
be my fate to delve.
"My dear," I ventured, "I hardly
think it would"
"I know it wouldn't," said GWENDOLEN.
"I have set my heart on growing our own
vegetables, and 1 think, Jack, we ought
to have a lawn as well."
"A lawn?" I queried.
"1 love a lawn."
I shook my head doubtfully. "I hardly
think real cottagers ■"
"Perhaps they don't," admitted Owen.
"But, you see, we 're both fond of tennis,
and if we didn't have a lawn of our own,
we should have to join a club ; so although
it added a pound or two to our rent, it
would save us in the end."
"So it would," I agreed.

CXXJ.

Mk. Punch's Musecm. — " Yeomen's
Arrears of Pay." This curiosity was
discovered in one of the pigeon - holes
of the War Office towards the end of
the tenth year of the Great Boer War,
enveloped in a mass of official memo-
randa. From the latter it has been con-
jectured that the Government of the
period considered that the phrase "to do
yeoman's service" meant "to serve
without pay," and that a wife and family
could be maintained on a South African
medal plus a few clasps. After a few
years it seems that all Yeomanry claims
wore extinguished by the simple process
of allowing the claimants to die out.
Many of them also had very reasonably
accelerated this result by undergoing
wounds and disablement while campaign-
ing for their country. It has not been
ascertained that there were ever any
arrears of pay in the case of military
officials and clerks who sat at home
while others did the fighting. Another
singular point in connection with this
extinct branch of the service was that
the British public (and especially the
employers) were extremely ready to
allow the Yeomen and other volunteers
to do battle in their defence, and as
remarkably loth to stretch a point and
keep their places open or provide them
with work on their return from the
front.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LIVES OF GEE AT MEN.
No. III.
The Rioht Honourable Adolphus Buffertop, M.P.
(Continued.)
Sing, Muse, of wool and all that comes of wool I
Take a swift flight to Coleman Street, E.C.,
Where the wool-brokers mostly congregate.
These are no common men: their minds are full
Of ships and bales and fleeces shorn to be,
Not merely to the State,
But to themselves a gain.
Attempt not to deceive them: 'tis in vain!
Textures they know and values; they have been
Down to the Docks, and passed in keen review
The cargoes new.
The heaped-up bales their careful eyes have seen,
With eager fingers plucking here and there,
The samples they compare,
And, though the work is scarcely .over nice,
Force them to yield the secret of their price.
Alas ! for wool which to the fancy seems
A thing of dreams,
Fleecy and soft and, above all things, clean!
Behold it as it is upon the Docks,
Reeking, exuding oil from all its flocks.
Vainly its votary seeks the silvery sheen
Pictured in visions; and, behold, he wears
Old clothes which he may soil,
But cannot spoil,
Since they were spoilt long years ago; and Poars,
Cleaver, Vinolia, or the ancient brown
Renowned in Windsor, is the soap
To meet and cope
With wool-reek when his daily work is done,
Somewhere about the setting of the sun.
Of these was Buffertop: in that old hall
Where wool is sold his father had a seat.
Thither with agile feet
And heart that in the hope of gain beat high,
Close to the auctioneer's revolving eye,
Blithely he strayed and loudly did he bawl.
In the fierce babel of competing tongues
He held his own and stretched his leathern lungs.
And none, I ween, know better how to take
Occasion by the hand and through the maze
Of prices win to profit, with a mind
Intent to make
His earnings overbalance his expense,
And so to find
He had his meed of unremitting praise
Wherever he might roam,
In Coleman Street, B.C., or in his home,
While all men said, " This is a man of sense."
Our hero's father went the way
That all wool-brokers must go.
They have, like us, their little day,
And then, like us, to dust go.
He, when he passed the Stygian bounds
And went to join the blest dead,
Left some two hundred thousand pounds
Judiciously invested.
His father's joy Adolphus was:
He never had a brother.
He was an only child because
There wasn't any other.
And so his father left him land;
He left him"all he could will:
His stocks, his shares, his cash in hand,
His business with its goodwill.
Adolphus mourned his father gone,
Hut, like a man of grit, he
Resolved at once to carry on
The business in the City.
To Coleman Street he seemed to grow
A sort of mould-of-form man;
He was wrapped up in wool, and so
Was quoted as a warm man.
When things were slack, when things wero Arm,
In dull times as in full trade,
He was, if I may use the term,
Bell wether to the wool trade.
This man of fleeces earned his wealth:
He never stooped to fleece us;
In open ways, and not by stealth,
He grew as rich as Crossus.
And all men thought and spoke him fair,
Especially the poor folk.
He had a house in Belgrave Square,
And leased a place in Norfolk.
And though he rarely took the life
Of partridge or of pheasant,
His own—he had a charming wife—
Was moderately pleasant.
At last there came a day when politics
Grew mixed, and a majority that seemed
Firm as a rocky cliff came crashing down.
Thereafter there was hurrying to and fro,
And rumour followed rumour till suspense
Could bear no further burden, and at last
The King dissolved his Parliament, and, lo!
The writs went flying forth through all the land.
Then Councils and Associations met;
Three Hundreds in their customary halls,
With their array of usual Presidents,
Passed party resolutions, and at once
Adopted candidates and faced the foe.
To his surprise—he mentioned that surprise
In his address—Adolphus Buffertop,
A pillar of our staple industry,
Was made a candidate. He had not hoped,
He said, for so much honour; yet he felt
At such a crisis every man must give
All that he could of energy and time
To save the State, himself among the rest.
Wherefore, he said (it is the common form),
He was prepared to leave no stone unturned,
Lest haply there might lurk beneath that stone
A chance of triumph; he had placed his hand
Swift to the plough, and would not cast a look
Behind him; if his friends would only march
Shoulder to shoulder, casting feuds aside,
Nothing could stop them: they were bound to
win.
Thereon he took his cheque-book and subscribed
To fifteen cricket clubs, to twenty-three
Dissenting chapels, sixteen Church bazaars,
Twelve football clubs, and presently became
Oddfellow, Buffalo, and Heart of Oak,
Free Gardener, Loyal Shepherd, Forester,
And Ancient Druid and much else beside;
And having platformed here and platformed thero,
And spoken neither wisely nor too well,
Was in the end triumphantly returned
Head of the poll, and so the land had peace.
R. C. L.

THE FLOWER OF CHIVALRY; OR, REAL AND IDEAL.
Within a greeny bower
Roofed by a twisted tower,
A morbid maid,
Id silk arrayed,
Moped o'er a pale-eyed flower.
Her sad robe, flowing wide,
With pearly cords was tied,
Her gold, gold hair,
In rivers rare,
Flowed down on either side.
With languid grace she prest
The pale flower to her breast,
And threw her eyes
Up to the skies
In gold and purple drest.
Lovalotte was she hight
And many a noble knight
Had shook with fear
When she drew near,
For, ah, she was a sight!
And one fair morn there came
A noble knight whose name
Was Lance-a-lotte,
And he, I wot,
As any knight was'game.
Fair Lovalotte 'gan he
To woo on bended knee,
His head he bowed
And five times vowed
Her love-lord he would be.
But when eftsoons he traced
Lovalotte's morbid taste,
He held it crime
That she her time
In such drear way should waste.
And 'gan he to insist
That she should straight desist.
But she replied,
With wild eyes wide :—
"I am an Idealist!"
Then Lance-a-lotte fell sad,
For that too late he had
Discovered she^
His wife to be,
Was little short of mad.
Inclined he did not feel
To take a wife Ideal,
Who moped in bower
O'er palo-hued flower,
And sniffed at what was Real.
So from his casque he snatched
A one-eyed flowrer that matched
That to which she
Had come to be
So very much attached.
Down on his knees he prayed
This Idealistic maid
Would in her bower
Caress his flower
Until its bloom did fade.
"When I will come," he cried,
"And claim thee for my bride!"
Then Lance-a-lotte
From Lovalotte
Away did swiftly ride.
But still in greeny bower,
Roofed by a twisted tower,
That morbid maid
In silk arrayed
Mopes o'er her lover's flower.
Nor recks the morbid maid
The trick that knight had
But wonders why, [played,
As years go by,
That flower will never fade.
The truth, then, to reveal:
"To maiden so Ideal,"
Said Lance-a-lotte,
"Give I can not
A flower that's grossly Real!"
So in that greeny bower,
Until her dying hour,
That morbid miss
May fondly kiss
That artificial flower.
L'Envoi.
This chivalric romance
I further will enhance
By one or two
More words to you
Of deep significance.
A wife filled with " Ideals"
Seldom to man appeals—
He likes to feel
That someone Real
Will superintend his meals!

To play their part in this historic scene,
Would watch the preconcerted signals mottle

Their wares as well as you.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In The History of Sir Richard Calmady (Methuen) Lucas
Malet has produced the greatest work in fiction the new
century has seen. That is not saying much in point of time
measurement. But it will be remembered that within that
space two novels have appeared of which it is boasted they
had, to begin with, a circulation of 100,000. They are poor
things, of the glittering meretricious merit that attracts and
stimulates the commonplace mind that likes to think it is
thinking. Richard Calmady may possibly not reach a sale of
20,000. But it is good work, its foundation deeply set in
human nature, its structure ,shapen by skilful hands. It is
the supreme triumph of the artist that, deliberately selecting
for her hero a natural abortion, she conquers aversion. This
achievement is in no wise due to paltering with the subject.
She is even ruthlessly insistent upon the actuality of the
deformity of her legless man, and in many graphic touches
brings its horror home to the mind of the reader by description
of its momentary effect upon those in his presence. Yet my
Baronite. comes to feel and understand with Honoria how,
whether in his good or evil moods, the helpless cripple,
pitying, hating himself by reason of his deformity, is the
master spirit in whatever circle he finds himself. The courage?
with which Lucas Malet grapples with the intrinsically
disagreeable motif of her story is shown in other directions.
In Helen de Vallorbes is limned in flesh colour a courtezan of
fuller animak nature than any of her sisters who live in the
annals of Paris in Bourbon days, or in the records of ancient
Rome. It is curious how a woman resolved to deal with
these matters literally goes the whole hog. She dares to
describe episodes most men, if they are familiar with them,
would rather not speak about. In this respect GEORGE MOORE,
not without reproach, is an ascetic scribe compared with Lucas
Malet. Withal there is a difference. Lucas Malet looks upon
and thoroughly understands a world composed of bad and good.

picturesque in description and occasion-

part dull to weariness; yet just when the
expert reader is beginning to follow the
example of the tinker during the first part
of the Taming of the Shrew, performed by
a nobleman's private company of his-
trions, lie is aroused from his doze and
his attention arrested by some telling

AN UN-HAPPY THOUGHT.
I STOOD within the City's hum,
Where slender clerks and merchants come
And go intent on trade.
The atmosphere was damp and brown,
And foggy whirlwinds up and down
My spinal column played.
And past ino swept a human tide
Which gathered force from every side,
But I observed it not.
The traffic's roar was in my ear,
The towering buildings far and near
To me were but a blot.
No sense had I of weal or woe
Which marked this hurrying to and fro;
Another time I might
Have given a philosophic touch
To such a scene, for there was much,
To ponder in the sight.
But now from me such thoughts as these
Were far removed as chalk from cheese,
I only felt the air
My frame wascutting through and through,
And that I had neglected to
Put on niy winter wear 1

you my own somewhat weird experiences.
A year ago last April (to be strictly
accurate it was the night of April the
first) I had a most appalling dream. I am
perfectly certain of the night in question,
as I keep a careful diary, and various
trivial events combined to fix the exact
date in my mind. For instance, we had
pork-chops for supper, and my Aunt
Maria having threatened me with
nightmare, I playfully ate a double por-
tion as a rebuke to her superstitious
ideas; for, as the veriest schoolboy is
aware, no such creature as the "night-
mare " has ever existed. But revenons u
nos moutons, let me return to my dream.
In the course of the night I had one of
the most horrible experiences ever granted
to mortal man. I seemed to be struggling
for bare existence amid the blackness of
falling. Down, down I fell, but before
reaching the end of that hideous fall, I
awoke with a shriek, and gasping for
breath! All this I noted in my diary, but
nothing liappened. For a few days I was
in hourly expectation of a catastrophe,
but the event gradually faded from my
mind. Note the sequel! On the first of
April last, exactly a year after the above-
recorded dream, as I was coming from my
bedroom—I tripped over a loose end of
carpet and fell—fell down two flights of
stairs, covering myself with bruises,
twisting my ankle, and remaining an
invalid for three months.
I may say that I had no thought of the
dream in my mind at the time. Comment
is quite needless.—Yours affectionately,
A Dreamer.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SONG OP THE PURSUIT.
Come bring mo my weapons, pome saddle my steed
(Who hunts for Dk Wet. must be eager indeed)!
Let rifle bo ready and trappings be trim.
For he whom we follow is crafty and " slim."
Bring waggons, and see that the oxen are strong—
The road we must travel is rugged and long—
Come, load them with victuals, with meat and with bread,
For I and my soldiers will need to be fed.
And bring up those tables and sofas and chairs
(For every contingency prudence prepares),
And those kitchen-ranges, and then, let me see.
Those wardrobes—they '11 all come in handy, may be.
Harmoniums bring, and pianos as well.
To lead the loud chaunt that our triumph shall swell.
And soothe War's grim strife with their comforting art;
Now on to the chase! for we 're ready to start.
Still on ! hurry on, for the country we '11 scour,
With an effort we '11 cover three miles in an hour;
And tremble, De Wet, at our pitiless chase,
For the copy-books say: "Slow and sure wins the race."
THE "IRIS" QUESTION.
Had Iris been written by "a person of no importance," and
produced by a speculative manager, it is more than probable
that it would have been received with scant courtesy by a
first-night audience, and pretty generally condemned by the
professional critics. Hut being a play—another specimen of
what has been stupidly termed "the problem play "—written
by our chief dramatist, Mr. Pinero, it has been treated with
lenient criticism, with even laudatory notices, and has received
the honour of an article in the editorial type of our leading
English journal.
Mr. Pinero has attempted to surpass himself by out-Tan-
queraying Tanqueray, and he has failed, distinctly failed. His
play, Iris, at the Garrick, never once comes within measurable
distance of his play, The Second Mrs. Tanqueray, at the St.
James's. Iris is admirably cast, and, with one exception,
admirably played ; but that exception is Iris herself, as repre-
sented by Miss Fay Davis. Mr. Pinero. however, deliberately
chooses his own cast for his own pieces, and, therefore, it
must be taken for granted that Miss Fay Davis impersonates
the heroine to the entire satisfaction of the author. Ho knows
what he wants, and it is to bo supposed that what he wanted
he has obtained in Miss Fay Davis for Iris.
Charming as this actress was, and, it is to be hoped, still is,
in certain parts where the brightness and naivete of the ingenue
have to be emphasised, she seems quite overweighted in this
part of Iris, while her peculiar American mannerism in speak-
ing seems to drag out to .weariness a play out of which at least
an hour's talk could bo judiciously excised to the greatest
possible advantage. However, Miss Fay Davis plays Iris for
"all she's worth," and if Mr. Pinero is pleased then the
public should be satisfied.
Mr. Oscar Asche, as the repulsively genial and ferociously
affectionate Frederick Muldonado, a whitey-brown Othello, is
very powerful: were he not so, the occasional nervous titter
that his action excitos would soon have burst out into an
unrestrainable guffaw.
Mr. Charles Bryant's presentment of the lover, Laurence
Trenwith, is a fine rendering of a very difficult part. But they
are all difficult parts, and Mr. Dion Boucicault triumphs in one
of the most improbable and most unsympathetic of them, Croker
Harrington, who is simply a weak, contemptible fool, permitted
by the author to recognise the moral degradation of his foolish-
ness. As the embezzling solicitor, Archibald A'ane, Mr. Jerrolo
Robertshaw is excellent. To these two actors and to some of
the ladies, Miss Beryl Faber, Miss Nora Lancaster, Miss
Regina Repton, and Mrs. Maesmore Morris, are given the only
lines probably intended by the author to impart to the general
conversation a spark or two of tho old Pinero brilliancy. But
alas! it is " the light that failed."
And the plot? A rich young widow will lose all her money
on re-marrying; so, while encouraging the familiar attentions
of all sorts and sizes of persons, and behaving in such a manner
towards them individually as would most decidedly entitle
each one to consider himself alone as the person of her choice,
she really falls in love with a penniless young man, and having
suddenly thrown over a millionaire whom she has accepted, she
hurls herself into tho arms of the youth and remains there as
the curtain falls on this decidedly strong situation. Then Iris
and Laurence live together abroad; but Laurence wearies of
it, wants to work, and after a tender farewell (a "very telling
scene this—quite the best), he leaves her. In his absence Iris
loses all her money, and is destitute; Ma/rfoiiarJo provides her
with means, and, to put it plainly, and "come to Hecuba" at
once, she becomes Maldonado's mistress.
How she arrives at this we partly see, as when she uses the
millionaire's cheque-book, and partly hear from herself when
she informs her lover on his return what has happened in his
absence. The lover won't marry her, and leaves the house.
Maldonado, having overheard the scene between them, and
learnt the true history of Mistress Iris, to whom he has offered
marriage, goes half mad, assaults her and then turns her out of
the house, where, after the curtain is down and Maldonado has
finished smashing the " properties " and had a fit of apoplexy,
let us hope that young Laurence, repenting now of his harsh-
ness and injustice, is waiting to receive poor Iris and ready to
take her away to his ranch (it always is a ranch nowadays)
where they will live happily ever afterwards.
And this story (illustrated by the most effective scene painting
from those "Brother Brushes," Messrs. Harford and Ryan)
takes from eight till twenty minutes past eleven to tell. Why,
it might easily and far more effectively be done from nine till
eleven, and then stalls and circle would come in a far more
tolerant humour than at present, having been able to dine
comfortably. Ah, Mr. Pinero, give the public a Third Afr«.
Tanqueray, and the audience (no " young persons " present, of
course) will sit it out for three hours, enjoying your humour,
the lights and shades of your wit, and be more than content.
SOMETHING LIKE A CURE.
(Notes from the blank pages of Mr. Briefless Junior's Fee Book.)
Doctor's Orders.—To be off at once. No more nonsense about
"being tied by the leg to town and unable to get away." Said
the same thing for twenty years consecutively. Not admissible
this year. Must go. Some place Switzerlandwards. Ouchy
fair, but Evian better. Great place for " a cure" Evian.
En route. — Started from Victoria at 10 a.m., Ostend (via
Dover) at four or thereabouts. Tho circulars and other im-
portant documents at the Temple must answer themselves.
Delightful to get away from Fleet Street and three hundred
yards round. Beautiful passage. Luncheon on board the boat
—Rapide in name and quality—excellent. The waves ruled by
Britannia as they should be. English travellers, rosy cheeks.
A few foreigners melancholy and inclined to demand tho pre-
sence of their mothers—and the steward. Ever thus. Ostend
in sight. A third of a mile or thereabouts of the Royal Palace
Hotel. Plage, seen through glass, deserted. The season over.
Giddy throng migrating—like tho swallows—South. Sooner or
later the giddy throng, plus tho swallows, will appear in Monte

places vacant. Compartment for four. Appeal to the con-
ductor. It might be that on arrival at Brussels a third occupant
might cuter the compartment! Painful consideration. Motto:
"J,et us hope for the best."
A Shadow by the Way.—-Train pauses at Brussels for new
travellers. Have a recollection—or may bo an impression—
that a stout foreigner sought admission to the compartment for
four at Brussels. I suggested to him that it would be incon-
venient—he could sec it would bo so—if ho claimed full
privileges of his wagon lit. But he cried, "Oh, 1 have not
been in bed for three days." Then he undressed and retired
into his berth, with the explanation that he was " the father of
a family." Distinctly embarrassing, as the wagons (its are
intended for travellers without distinction of sex. Impression:
may have been a dream—a nightmare. Still, as a precaution, as
well to see that you have a coupe compartment for yourself
when you have not left your better seven-eighths at home.
Otherwise railway travelling in Belgium delightful.
A Dinner on Wheels.—Turned into the Restaurant car. Menu
simpio and' sound. Table d'hote that would satisfy the
requirements of a doctor strong on diet. Sauces at a discount.
Simple soup. Simple fish. Simple meat. Simpio salad. Wine
to match. Simple and good. Prices — like tho banquet—
reasonable.
Through the Watches of the Night.—Sounds of wheels—and, if
the impression were more than a dream—the reverberation
of deep breathings. "The father of a family " was unconscious,
and apparently not easily self-awakened. Eveiy now and
again the train stopped. A pause, a whistle, a melancholy
sound on a horn—suggestive of the sixpenny trumpet of tho
nursery—and away once more into the darkness. Basle.
Breakfast.—Everyono turns out. Cafe an lait. Leather-
lunged official shouts out various names. "You can go to
Paris or Ostend, or Geneva or Italy." Ask him a question.
The reply is the same. Same voice, same shout. Universal
answer to everything. You may call him a fool. If you are
irritable you will. Ciood time for irritability, 8 A.M., after tho
deep breathings of a fat father of a presumably fat family.
End of Vie Journey.—Nine hours of continuous travel. The
nightmare disappeared. Fat father returned to his presumably
fat family. No more deep breathings. Sunshine. Peeps at tho
Lac Leman. Lovely scenery. Better already. Not so much
traffic perhaps as in Fleet Street. But seems infinitely more
beautiful. At any rate for a while. Road too not up. Possibly
because chief highway is a water-course. But certainly Fleet
Street for scenery not a patch on Lac Leman. More miles,
more peeps. Ouchy. Programme: rest for twenty-four hours
to recover from nightmare, and then across the lake to Evian—
and the cure.
Parting reflections (made on watching the moonlight shining on
the scenery). Mountains of silver! Twinkling lights in fairy
palaces! Trees with golden leaves and jewelled shrubberies!
Ships passing in the night! Dreamland! Beautiful! Lovely
beyond compare! Far liner than Fleet Street!

On an autumn evening in the year 190'?,
the Londoner and the Country Cousin
were strolling together along the Em-
bankment.
"I thought so," observed the Country
Cousin, as a dull booming sound tilled the
air, "I said we should have thunder
before long."
"Thunder?" cried his friend, "that's
not thunder—it's a signal gun from one
of the newspaper offices. Haven't you
heard of the new plan of publishing the
latest intelligence? Look!"-—as he spoke
a shower of many-coloured rockets leapt
towards the sky — "that's from the
Sparkler." (Boom! Bang! Crash! came
explosions in the neighbourhood of the
Strand.) "All, and there's the Screech-
Owl's latest starting prices."
"But," gasped the Country Cousin,
half-stunned by the deafening explosions,
which increased in frequency each
minute, "how on earth do you know what
those noises mean?
The Londoner produced a small volume
from his pocket. "Got them all down in
this code," he said. "There! see that
Bengal light? that means"—ho turned
over the pages hastily—" that means—oh,
confound it! that Niagaras have dropped
another couple of points—and my broker
said they were safe to rise!"
At this moment a succession of roars
from a steam-siren drowned his voice,
and a salvo of artillery went off (appar-
ently) just behind the Country Cousin's
back.
"Good heavens!" ho exclaimed, "and
is all your news"
"The German Emperor's made another
speech! " shouted the Londoner, looking
intently at his signal-book, "and the fore-
cast for to-morrow is westerly winds,
unsettled, and—hi! look out!"
As he spoke a showrer of "golden rain"
descended upon the Country Cousin's head
from a passing fire-balloon.
"Of all the fiendish ideas," spluttered
the Country Cousin, "which ever"
"Oh, it's all right! " said the Londoner,
cheerfully, "that signal says—by the
way, isn't your coat on Are ?—-that Jessop
has got another century!"
A flash like lightning blinded thoir eyes
and caused the Country Cousin to stagger
backwards. The Londoner, however, re-
mained unmoved.
"That's from the Upper Ten office," he
said, "to tell us that the Duke of
Peppercorn has left for Scotland. And
those guns mean that Mr. Able has
finished the ninety-second chapter of his
now book, The Everlasting Suburb. Grand
system, isn't it? All the latest news, you
see, and nothing to pay!"
"Take me home!" said the Country
Cousin piteously; "for goodness sake, take
me home! I'm deafened, blinded, stunned
—oh! what in the world is that?"
He pointed to the sky, which, in the
direction of Fleet Street, had become a
vivid, ghastly green.
"Oh, thatt" returned his friend with
some contempt; that "s only the coloured
fire they burn every night on the top of
the. Sturdy Patriot office. It's a signal,
of course, and it means 'the South
African War is now practically over.'"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TRIALS OF AUTHORSHIP;
On, Literature as she is now wrote.
Scene—A Publisher's sanctum. To those
who are unacqtiaintcd tvith this sacred
apartment a description is impossi-
ble; to those ivho are, unnecessary.
A publisher is gracefully sitting in an
armchair making desultory notes in a
"tastefully" bound book. Enter an
Author, nods affably to Publisher, who
greets him with a certain restraint.
Author sits nervously, a sickly smile
■ flickers on his lips and goes out under
the severe scrutiny of the Publisher.
Publisher. You received my note?
j Author. Yes, I came as you requested,
;in reply
I Publisher (pursing liis itps). It's a
serious business. This last book of yours
has fallen absolutely1 flat.' It's a hope-
less fizzle.
• Author (greatly alarmed). Really, I
can't understand it.
Publisher (in brisk, matter-of-fact tones).
Of course, the book is a dead loss as it
stands. Something must be done.
Autlior. We made a great mystery of
the authorship, too.
Publisher. Yes, but I'm afraid that kind
of thing is played out.
Author (in the spirit of a bright sugges-
tion). I was thinking—if it could be "cur-
rently reported that a titled lady had
dictated it to her cook through the tele-
phone."
Publisher. But you did that with your
Sentimental Servant Girl.
Author. True. (Sits abashed but
thoughtful.)
Publisher. Perhaps you don't write
often enough to the papers. How are
the drains in your district? Can't you
make them a subject of complaint?
Author. I'm afraid not. I'm on the
Vestry.
Publisher. Haven't you a new theory
to end the war?
Author. Not ready. I've given advice
to all the Generals, and severely cen-
sured the Commissariat.
Publisher. Yes. That did a little for
your Travels with a Typeivriter. What
about being taken ill at the theatre?
Author (defcctcdly). Last time I did
that it was misunderstood, and I was
turned out for being disorderly.
Publisher. Yes, I am afraid there was
a little mismanagement somewhere.
Couldn't you keep a tiger in your
garden?
Autlior (with great trepidation). Poor
Tvper bought what was supposed to be a
tame giraffe, to give his last^ book of verse
a fillip, and, if you remember, it ate him.
Publisher (ivith professional pride). Yes,
but he had the satisfaction of knowing
before he died that the third edition of
his stuff was completely exhausted. It
established a record in minor verse.
Author (encouragingly). I've got a motor
car.
Publisher (with contempt). So has every-
body. (With sudden inspiration.) Will it
blow up?
Author. I—I hope not.
Publisher. Think how it would send up
your book!
Author. Yes, but I should go up with it.
Publisher (impatiently). Of course there
is that possibility. Couldn't you manage
a little inexpensive law suit?
Author (with gloomy countenance at past
recollections). The last one nearly landed
me in prison and cost an enormous amount.
Publisher. You were unfortunate in your
counsel. Well, something must be done.
I am afraid I shall have to ask you to fall
down a coal mine.
Author (hopelessly). Well, if I must, I
must; but (with a piteous appeal) I have
only just recovered from falling out of a
balloon to boom my last book!
(Scene closes.)
HYDE PARK AND THE FAIRY.
II.—My Second Encounter.
BAYSWATER had broken out into an
epidemic of ladders and paint-pots, and it
was grateful to turn into Kensington
Gardens with its fluttering leaves and
nuttish atmosphere. Besides, I was
anxious to find my friend Uie fairy again,
and remove, if possible, the bad impression
I had left the other day. I sauntered
along by the fountains — which were in
a state of autumnal somnolence — and
watched for a sign of the blue-eyed elf.
A duck waddled solemnly across the path
into the grass beyond, and there was a
cold, cynical look about its glance, as if it
wondered who could be foolish enough to
look for fairies when worms were to be
had. I followed the duck idly, and moved
my stick to flick away the petal of some
flower that was clinging to my sleeve.
"I wish I could see the fairy!" I
murmured disconsolately.
The petal floated away from my stick on
to the ground, and two bright eyes shone
up at me. "Then why didn't you stand
in a fairy-ring before?"
"I had quite forgotten about these
things," I said, looking down in ashamed
surprise. "Of course, when I was a kiddy
I knew all about fairy-rings, but as one
grows older"
"You shouldn't grow older," said the
fairy seriously. "That's where most
mortals make the mistake; it's easy
enough to remain young if you wish.
There, for instance (pointing towards a
seat), is a child who never grew up."
I followed the fairy's flourish and saw
an old woman with white hair and de-
crepit form.
"Bah!" said the fairy, noticing my
expression, "don't look at the outside,
look into her eyes! interpret her smile.
A child, I tell you, who knows as much
about us now as she did when she wore
short frocks, and when we used to play
tricks with her tangled chestnut hair.
Now don't pull that long face—tell me,
don't you think we've been working
hard?"
I looked up at the trees, and the truth
suddenly flashed upon me.
"Yes, the invisible painters have been
working splendidly; what pigment do
you use to get that wonderful burnish of
golden-brown?"
"A fairy secret," laughed the elf.
"But you're improving. Really, you
look twenty years younger now. I think,
however," she added reflectively, "we
shall have to send a message to the frost-
goblin soon. He's rather spiteful some-
times, but he brightens up the trees when
they are inclined to mope, and they grow
quite scarlet with excitement in their
foliage tips when he plays at hide and
seek."
"Take care," I exclaimed irrelevantly,
as the exenrsionising duck waddled along
right in the way of the fairy.
"I'm all right,'' nodded the elf, and sure
enough the duck bore round elaborately
to the left just before it came up to us.
"Uninteresting birds," I murmured,
watching the ungainly intruder.
"Now don't grow old again I" ex-
postulated my little friend. "You were
quite nice and young a moment ago.
Uninteresting, you think. If you heard
the stories they tell the peacocks about
what happens in the Park and Gardens
every day you wouldn't think so."
"I should like," I began—then started
with a sudden recollection. "Oh dear, I
must hurry away now. I have to report
some afternoon lecture—very dull—but a
journalist, you know"
"Yes; it's very unfortunate," sighed
the fairy.
"Of course," I added in self-defence,
"journalism is a splendid profession in
many ways. It quickens the intelli-
gence"
"So I observed," said the fairy^dryly.
"There, don't look so cross. Come back
another day—feeling young, mind you.
Choose a fairy-ring and wish to hear the
Story of the One-eyed Duck. Then—even
if I'm not about here, and I've promised
to go down to Bethnal Green to-morrow—
you will find that you will have to revise
your opinion as to ducks. Goodbye."
A light breeze whirled away what looked
like a saffron leaf. My fairy friend had
vanished, and I stepped away briskly,
speculating about the One-eyed Duck and
anathematizing the lecturer.
Oceana.—A curious fact in yachting :—
Whenever "blanketing" is done, it is by

[October 9, 1901.
PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
A MUCH INJURED MAN.
Chapter II.
"And have yon como for the whole season, Mr. Bounoerby?"
asked the little heiress. She spoke in very winning tones, and
I ceased regretting her fair cousin. After all, does not
Shakspeare—or some other fellow—tell us that beauty is only
skin deep? So I made up my mind to go in, vi et armis, for the
rich Miss ACRESBY, and to cast out all thought of the other.
Gadsby had told me the heiress had her penniless cousin
living with her as a sort of paid companion. A very good
berth of it she must have, thought I, as I looked at the fault-
lessly cut habit she wore, and the glorious piece of horseflesh
she was riding.
"Yes," I said, in deliberate tones, "I think I'll stay the
season through. This seems a very decent sort of country,
though, of course, it's not Leicestershire," I added, as 1
smiled down on her.
"Oh, you've been accustomed to hunt in Leicestershire?"
she asked. "Then I'm afraid you won't care much for this.
What hounds did yon go with, there?"
Well, that was rather a stupid thing for her to ask, because,
as a matter of detail, I hadn't ever hunted in Leicestershire.
Hut 1 passed it oft with a gentle smile. Then she asked
another stupid question. "How many horses have you brought
here? We—my cousin and I—have only five between us, but
we are going to havo as much fun out of them as we can."
Now, I naturally didn't want to say that my stud—that, in
fact, I was, at that precise moment of time, sitting on my
stud; so I remarked, enigmatically, "A man may have a good
many horses, but he may not have them all with him, eh?"
Whereupon she smiled—probably wondering what the deuce
I meant. I didn't quite know, myself.
Meantime, Gadsby was making himself extremely agreeable
to the companion. Awfully good of Gadsby, really. Then
hounds came tumbling out, on the line of a fox, and we all
prepared for the coming gallop.
Slowly at first, they puzzled it out, then gradually in-
creasing the pace, onwards they went down a grass field until
coming to a small brush fence. Over this I led, and we galloped
on, across some ridge and furrow, I well in front. I always like
leading any field I may find myself out with. Hate the sight
of wretched dulTers afraid to ride over a fence. Always was
rather a daredevil of a fellow, but really cannot help it. Dr
Thodk tells me I am awfully rash across country. Perhaps
he's right. Wo went on across some half-dozen fences—some
of them well over two feet high, I should say—1 found myself
still leading, and looking over my shoulder saw the rest- strug-
gling behind me. Then we came in sight of a nasty-looking
post-and-rails; and I had, most regretfully, to pull up, because
I didn't think my throat-lash was quite tight enough. The way
those two girls charged the obstacle was something awful; it
quite took my breath away, and made me feel nervous—if that's
possible. Now, I fancy 1 know something about riding across
country; and after 1 had got the throat-lash to my entire
satisfaction, it seemed to me rather a waste of jumping power,
to ride at that post-and-rails. So I cantered up the field till
I reached an open gate, and directly I was through this, I
pushed along as fast as my horse could go—I'm a pretty hard
rider—until reaching another post-and-rails, as big as the
former ones. Then, as I couldn't see anything of hounds—
or even of the people following them—I thought my most
sensible plan was to light a cigar, find my way on to the high
road, and get back to " The George," in time for a comfortable
luncheon.
I was in a bit of a puzzle to know how to appear, next day,
at covert'side on the same horse again without it being noticed.
So I told my stud-groom that I had a fancy for painting out my
horse's white face and white forelegs. He stared, and I feared
that ho would relapse into a giggle. But I glared at him in
stony silence, and after a momentary struggle, the inclination
was conquered, and the danger past. He touched his forehead
with his customary humility, and left the room.
Next day, hounds were at Gerrard's Barn, six miles away.
This time I was not late, and my virtuo was rewarded by
falling in with the two Acresby girls on the road to the meet.
Again, the "companion" bowed somewhat distantly. "Can't
get over her shyness, I suppose," 1 said to myself. The dark-
eyed little lady, however, was as vivacious as ever.
"Where did you get to, yesterday, Mr. Bouncerby?" she
asked, looking at me quite archly. "We didn't see you
anywhere."
"Oh, I took a line of my own," I answered airily.
"Capital gallop, wasn't it ?" she said.
"Splendid," I replied. And then we fell to discussing the
theatres, new books, &c, as we jogged easily along to covert-
side. '.
We had a capital blank day, in which, there being no hunting,
flirting took its place, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Even
the hitherto coy "companion" came out of her shell, and talked
affably. I insisted on escorting them home to the pleasant
little house they had taken, and to my great delight, was asked
to afternoon tea on the morrow, which was a non-hunting day.
As I rodo home, I could plainly see what an impression I had
made on the heiress, though, as 1 have said before, not at all
a conceited fellow.
When I went to tea—a function I generally hate, but we men
must occasionally sacrifice ourselves, in order to give the
women a little pleasure in life—I was really quite charmed
with all I saw. The delicate Sevres , the elegant dresses of the
two Misses Acresby, the silent footman, and the general air of
wealth and luxury, were all grateful to a man of refined and,
I fear, somewhat expensive tastes. Both ladies were delightful
as conversationalists, and I came away having thoroughly made
up my mind to take the plunge, and marry the heiress. Mar-
riage, of course, is always a pill to a man; so it is as well that
it should be thoroughly gilded when one has to swallow it.
For nearly a month this pleasant life continued. I was asked
to dinner, tea, and luncheon, at the Acresbys', and always
managed to get in some words alone with my charming little
brunette. At last 1 came to the conclusion that the time had
arrived to lay myself at the feet—figuratively speaking, of
course—of the heiress. I may say that, being of a prudent
nature, I had already made enquiries as to the extent of that
lady's fortune, and found that the sacrifice of liberty would
be well worth my while, from a financial point of view. That
Miss Acresby was madly in love with me there could, of
course, be absolutely no doubt. Well, 1 couldn't complain. I
must frankly admit that I had given her a good deal of en-
couragement.
When a fellow encourages a girl—and even a look—at all
events, one of my looks, so Ds Thode says—is sometimes
sufficient to raise hopes in the female breast—he must be pre-
pared to take the consequences—that is, he must be prepared
to think seriously over the great sacrifice. And especially
when the man has not a copper which he can legitimately
call his own, and the girl possesses a comfortable number of
thousands which she is able, and more than willing, to cast at
his feet. This was, more or less, the case with me, and so I
finally determined upon making the plunge. It would please
my people, even if it failed to amuse me. F. R.

First Sec. Your Majesty, it is the design

it will do. Only this doorway must be
higher. So. With a little more ornament
on the architrave. Thus. It is approved.
As for the Bagdad railway (Enter

Give me paper, pencils and indiarubber.
I wonder what sort of thing it can be.

presume to assist so consummate an artist

Edward. A sort of vase with a crown on
it.
Count. An exquisite design, your

Kaiser. What? I thought you said you
had no artistic talent.
Count. None, your Majesty, to design.
But sufficient to admire. No one, however
ignorant of art, could inspect unmoved
that superb masterpiece. And the inscrip-

so concise!

Kaiser. What now?
Third Sec. It is a design, your Majesty,

Kaiser. That won't do. The design is

is not in that style at all. Really the
Municipality gives me a lot of work.

bin at the Rathaus is prejudicial to the
public health.
Kaiser. Dear, dear 1 Do you think you

What, more plans?
Fourth Sec. Yes, your Majesty.
Kaiser. What is this? "Green Park"?
There is some mistake. Who has dared
to make a mistake? It is in London. An
absurd plan for widening Piccadilly. Has
the English Government sent this to ine
because it has gone for its holiday? If so,
I will design it all afresh in two minutes.
Fourth Sec. Pardon?me, your Majesty.
It is a possible amendment of the plan of
London to be lodged in the Ministry of
War.
Kaiser. That explains it. It is ap-
proved. The English Government would
never have time for its two months
holiday if it attended to such things,
even when it was at work, more or less.
I say, Bulow, do you play golf? Wouldn't
you like to go and bask in the sun at

time even for that. Let's settle about

T.ie cab? Oh—er—yes, you'd better
tell the man to wait. Of course. And
tell Mr. Grey I'm here with my son—
Lady Wksskx. I should like to see him
as soon as possible.
Have you got your watch, Marjory?
I do hope these people will be quick. I
know they '11 keep us waiting for ages,
and we shan't get back in time for—
Percy! Please, darling. Do sit down,
my pet. You go fussing about the room
just like a large blue-bottle. Remember,
you've got to be a good boy now, and do
what mummy tells you, or else I can't
let you come to this nice school. Oh,
but it is, a charming school, and—my
darling boy, you do want to come. You
know you do. Doesn't ho, Marjory?
Very well, then, Percy. If you say that
again I '11 take you straight back to
Fr&nlein, and you know you can't bear
her. Though I'm sure I'm not surprised,
you poor thing. It's really most extra-
ordinary that people who go in for teach-
ing are always so—so—what's the word,
Marjory ?—'m no, not formidable, so—
er—angular. So angular. Poor FrSulein
is dreadfully angular, and 1 'm sure this
Mr. Grey will be just the same, and I
never know what to talk to them about.
We've so little in common, and they
fidget mo so, and—Percy, you are not to
play with the blihds. You're sure to—
there! I told you so. You've broken it.
How tiresome of you. Now do sit down.
Yes, yes, my pet, I know. It 'a a horrid
bore waiting; but if you'll be good I'll
send you some marrons glacen directly I
get home. That's a dear boy.
I do wish, Marjory, I'd made your
father bring Percy down. But he's
always so dreadfully selfish. Oh, why
don't they come. What am I to talk to
them about? They're sure not to know
a soul we do, and—oh, your Aunt Georgy!
Yes; but poor dear Georgy goes in for
knowing all sorts of extraordinary people.
She always was so different to the rest of
the family, poor darling. And then, of
course, she's quite mad about education.
You know the way she raves about Frank
Cuddesden, as if schoolmastering was the
only thing worth doing. Though why his
mother let him do it I never could
imagine. Why ain't he a soldier, now,
like his brothers? Of course, Jane
always was odd. But really! if it was
trade, now, or acting, or even the Church,
one could understand. But—oh, my
darling, you can't imagine anyone elioosing
to be a schoolmaster. Fancy being tied
for life to a set of spoilt, disagreeable
little—PERCY, darling, please be quiet.
Of course, if you look at it as a way of
making money—oh, Percy', what is it?
No, certainly not—way of making money,
it ain't a bad thing to do. I'm sure this
Mr. GREY charges enough; though, of
courie, really that's rather a comfort,
because he must get a nicer set of boys.
Frank's fees are too absurdly low. I told
your aunt I couldn't possibly send Percy'
to his school under the circumstances.
Low fees mean low everything else. Oh,
Aunt Georgy says! Yes, Georgy says—
but depend upon it, my dear, philanthropy
and keeping a school don't agree. The
people who charge most must get the
nicest boys, and that's my one reason for
choosing Mr. GREY. You know BOBBY
Grinsteu is here for one, and that horrible
little Conyers boy—here they are.
How do you do, Mr. Grey! Oh, no, not
at all, thanks. Of course, I know you 're
! dreadfully busy. I've been perfectly
| happy with my children. My daughter.
Lady Marjory. And my boy—Percy!
Percy darling! Come and talk to Mr.
Grey and toll him how sorry you are for
breaking his blind. Oh, but how nice of
you, Mr. GREY. He's a dreadful little
fidget, ain't you, my PERCY? I do hope
| you '11 be able to cure him, Mr. GREY.
! I can't manage it, and 1 've tried every-
thing, haven't I, Marjory? Everything!
Now who is this? Surely I—ah, I thought
so. Bobby Grinsted. How kind of you
to send for him. So like his poor darling
mother, Marjory, isn't he? Yes! Now,
Percy, my pet, run along with Bobby.
May he, Mr. Grey? 1 'd like to—oh, but
you mustn't say you don't want to.
No, thank you, Mr. Grey. 1 think I '11
just stay here, if 1 may, and have my little
talk with you. Sometimes I find Percy
dreadfully fatiguing. 1 can't think how
you—oh, is this—how do you do, Mrs.
Grey'? Thanks, yes, I am a little tired.
Your husband has most kindly offered to
take me over the place, but 1 think, if
you '11 forgive me, I won't. Then Mr.GREY
and I can have our little talk in peace.

THE LOGICIAN'S LOVE-SONG.
When lovers toast their fancies
And eagerly acclaim
Their Kates and Mauds and Nancies,
Sweet Barbara I name.
Unlike your maid contrary,
Now fiend, now -winsome fairy,
Her mood doth never vary—
She always is the same.
Her nature is as flawless
As is the morning star;
She suffers nothing lawless
Her premises to mar.
No follies can engage her;
She never trips—I '11 wager
No questionable major
Hath wiles to tempt her far.
Were they whose rival faces
Old Ilion's walls so curst
To match their glorious graces
With hers for whom I thirst,
Upon their merits purely
Might Paris judge securely,
For BARBARA'S figure surely
Must always bo the first.
PICCADILLY.
Widening tlie Wide and Neglecting the
Narrow.
The County Council and the First Com-
missioner of Works propose to relieve the
congestion of traffic in Piccadilly, at the
extreme ■western and eastern ends, by
cutting down some trees and widening
the roadway in tho central part of that
thoroughfare, where there is never any
block at all. This is not a joke, as one
might suppose; it is the serious proposal
of an official body and an official per-
sonage, who take themselves so seriously
that they aro quite incapable of seeing
the absurdity of anything. Taste in
planning street improvements cannot be
expected from any municipal assembly of
common-sense Englishmen. But for such
a body there is one word of magic
influence, the word "practical." If the
County Council and their equally common-
sense ally, the First Commissioner, would
consider it "practical " to loosen a man's
•waist-belt because his boots pinched him
and his hat -was not large enough, then,
perhaps, there is something to be said for
their amazing scheme.
Probably the Council has its eye on
Piccadilly as a future tramway route.
The extra width would just accommodate
the rails, and the forecourt of Devonshire
House would form an ideal terminal yard
and starting place for the electric tramcars
to Hounslow, to Hampton and to Hanwell.
The last, O Councillors, is a restful spot!
If ever you succeed in making that tram-
way, you might try a little trip there.
But if you want to be really " practical,"
why not endeavour to begin the widening

of Piccadilly at its narrowest part , bet ween
Swallow Street and tho Circus? It will
be ver3' expensive, but it will have to be
done some day. In a few years, no doubt,
there will bo a Twopenny Tube—possibly
oven a Penny Pipe—under Piccadilly.
Then the omnibuses will diminish in
number as thoy have already diminished
along Oxford Street. Would it not be
practical to leave well alone until then?
Why spoil what is, perhaps, the pleasantest
thoroughfare of its kind in Europe to
carry out a useless scheme which is not
practical at all?
And if you want to show still more
common-sense, why not apply to Parlia-
ment for power to check the ceaseless
tearing up of London streets? Instead of
widening roads of sufficient width at
present, why not try to keep intact the
narrower ones elsewhere?
Meanwhile there are rumours, possibly
untrustworthy, that the Council, for the
purpose of relieving the congestion of
traffic at the narrowest part of Bond
Street, is about to buy and set back one
side of Portland Place, and so add thirty
feet to the width of the roadway. It is
also said that the First Commissioner of
Works, equally alert in the public in-
terest, proposes to diminish the crush
of vehicles in Park Lane and Hamilton
Place by cutting down the trees on
both sides of the Broad Walk in Ken-
sington Gardens, and making that path,
still reserved for pedestrians and per-
ambulators, double its present width.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 16, 1901,
LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. IN.—The Right Honourable Adolphls Blffertop, M.P.
(Concluded.)
A GENIAL man was Buffertop:
He never put a side on.
In Parliament he did not drop
The friends he first relied on.
He worked upon a simple plan
Of modest self-effacement.
He did not seem to be a man
For office or for place meant.
He did not shine in brilliant deeds,
But, like a man of sense, he
Became devotedjto the needs
Of his Constituency.
. He knew his borough through and through:
He was amongst the rare men
Who knew, the Aldermen, and knew
His Presidents and Chairmen.
And so this vale of tears becamo
To him a Yale of Tempe,
A place of joy that loved the'name
Of " BUFFEllTOP, our M.P."
His understanding, 1,'eonfess,
Was what the world calls tacit.
But, though his talk was valueless,
His smile was quite an asset.
With smiles the man was seen to glow
When other men looked sadly,
Whenever things appeared to go
Immoderately badly.
Whate'er he felt when most depressed
By gloominess, he hid it.
He always tried to smile his best,
And generally did it.
Such men are always loved in Parliament;
Their merits far outshine the fitful gleams
Of.the uneasy spirits who arise
Time after time to catch the Speaker's eye,
And rail at Governments, and hurl their shafts
Of satire full in an opponent's face,
Saying,'/' What men are these who thus conspire
Against the safety of our well-loved land;
These indolent and miserable men,
Lapped in the ease of great emoluments,
Who sec the country totter to its fall,
And never raise a hand to dra w it back;
Nay, rather, with a treacherous intent,
Impel it to destruction ; wretched slaves
Who proudly clank their fetters, and prepare
Chains for the limbs of freedom-loving men?"
And some men cheer, and others, in despair,
Cry, " 'Vide, 'vide, 'vide!" or rise and shake their fists,
Implying that the frothy orator
Is no whit better than the men he scorns.
And some there are, keen fighters high in place,
Who, having to expound a policy,
Are not contented to explain at ease
Their scheme, but turn upon the other side,
. And taunt it, crying, "Lo! these men, who now
Oppose my policy, were once themselves
Keen workers for the end I have in view.
They failed, and now maliciously they strive
Against my policy—I should say ours,
For it is our united policy.
And wo are those that flinch not, but pursue
Our nobler purpose with an energy
Higher than theirs, and with a pure design,
Which, by its contrast, makes their paltry schemes
Muddy and foul; the true-souled patriot
Is here upon these benches; ho who speaks
Knows what he speaks of." Then, with dauntless mien,
Raking the Hansard dust-heaps, they contrive
To prove the Opposition but a mass
Of suicidal inconsistencies;
And, on the other hand, themselves appear
Firm and unwavering, patriotic, true,
Devoted to their King and fatherland.
But Buffkrtop held on his way:
He was born for the humdrum and stock work;
He came to the House every day,
And applauded and voted by clock-work.
The record of voting he burst:
When the lists had been faithfully reckoned,
It was found that AooLPHL'S was first,
With a very inferior second.
The knowledge and talents that were
The pride of his friends in the City,
He joyfully brought them to bear
On the business that's done in Committee.
And at length, as the years went along,
Men said, when they met and discussed him,
"We don't say he's brilliant or strong,
But he's safe, and we like him and trust him.
"He is never sarcastic or coarse,
And he never attempts to be funny;
But he works every day like a horse,
And, in fact, he's the man for our money."
Every detail or ruling he knew,
No man was so clearly a dab in it.
Till at last—which was felt as his due—
He was given a seat in the Cabinet.
And then in quick succession he became—
He,who was once the wool trade's ornament—
War-Minister, Colonial Minister,
And lastly Chancellor of the Exchequer
And leader of the House; and men declared
No man had ever led it with a hand
So firm and yet so pleasantly applied.
And some wrote letters to the newspapers
And said, " We knew this man in early life,
And even as a lad he showed the signs
Of greatness, and his brow was born to bear
The wreath reserved for those who guard the State."
Such then was Blffertop, nay is, for still,
As all men know, he lives and works and smiles.
And some day, when his toil is done, the King
Will make him peer, and send him to the Lords.

Fact and Fiction.—On seeing the drama of Sherlock Holme*
at the Lyceum, it may have occurred to others besides Mr.
Punch's official dramatic critic, that the detention of the
heroine' by that unscrupulous pair of villains, husband and
wife, or so representing themselves, was to the last degree
improbable. The situation, however, is justified by the
statement made by Mr. Charles Mathews, prosecuting in
"The Extraordinary Charge of Conspiracy" case, now sub
judice, and therefore not to be commented upon, at Marylebone
Police Court.

DOMESTIC ECONOMIES.
37ie Kitchen Garden.
By making the lawn a sine qua non of
our establishment we saved ourselves
no end of trouble, as Gwendolen pointed
out; for nine hundred and ninety-nine
cottages in every thousand were weeded
out, as it were, and the only difficulty
was to find the thousandth. We pedalled
many weary miles through many weary
counties, and 1 was beginning to despair
of ever succeeding in the quest of our
ideal, when one sweet evening, after a
long and fruitless day in the saddle,
Gwendolen suddenly sprang off her
bicycle and stood for a moment motion-
less, peering through a hole in an oak
paling!
"Eureka!" she cried. "Come and look
at this, Jack! Red tiles, gables, lawn
and everything!"
"Charming!" I cried, craning over
Gwen'S shoulder.
"I must live there."
"Darling, it's occupied."
"But perhaps it's to let. Ride on to
the gate—there might be a board up.
Jack, there is!"
"' Beware of the dog I' " I suggested as
its probable legend. "By Jove! it isn't
though. 'To Let. Etiquire Within.'"
Gwendolen fell off her bicycle in her
excitement, and in another moment was
hurrying up the drive.
"It's rather large," I suggested.
"It's perfectly heavenly," said Gwen-
dolen.
"It '11 be more than live pounds a year."
"It would be cheap at any price."
A comely old housekeeper showed us
over the bungalow, whose long French
windows opened on to the very lawn.
At every step Gwendolen became more
enchanted.
"Oh, Jack," she cried, "what a sweet
little study! Couldn't you write soully
] things in here!" And I, looking round
on the well-fllled shelves that ran right
up to the ceiling, felt that indeed I could.
"There's simply everything one could
want," said Gwendolen, when we had
completed our tour of the premises.
"Everything," I agreed. "It's a pity
the rent is so stiff. A hundred and"
"But look what we get for it! Compare
this house"
"Yes, I know. But still"
"The price includes everything. And
think of the garden! Asparagus and
peaches for nothing! Jack, it would be
madness to throw away the chance!"
* * * *
We are economising. Out of deference
to my feelings, Gwendolen has consented,
nothing loth, to forego the cycling skirt
and sailor hat with which she threatened
me; and the dainty muslins which she
wears instead keep so clean in the country
that they do not st so very much more

BANK SOON. I MUST HAVE SOMETHINO SOFT TO FALL OX!"
Please get into a
than the silk dress she had to wear in
town. We have no greengrocer, except
on occasions; for all my wife has to do
when we want vegetables is to tell the
head-gardener. We found it much cheaper
in the end to get two men to assist the
boy we had originally thought of, for
when I tried to grow asparagus I planted
it upside down; moreover, I got such
rheumatism from working in the wet that
Gwendolen, after a talk with the doctor,
insisted on my giving it up. And besides,
as she pointed out, if I spent all my
energy on manual labour, how could I
write those epoch-making works for
which the world was waiting? Our
friends are delighted to visit us in
summer; and when we find the long
winter evenings are beginning to drag,
we either pack up our traps for a month
in the Riviera, or run up to the Carlton
and do a week of theatres. Gwendolen is
persuading all her friends to return to a
natural life.
Nothing like Leather.—It is said that
the L. C. C. propose to supply their em-
ployes with boots at fixed rates, after
the method in vogue at Scotland Yard.
Of course, the denizens of Spring Gardens
will then be known as the London County
Cobblers.

Nor even what's his reason for existence).
The name of leader strictly should imply
A sort of object which contrives to lead,
Yet the reports that meet the common eye
Are such as any fool who runs may read,
Grasping the truth and letting go the lie,
Without a paraphraser's flowing screed;
You don't get any wiser through a resume,
Although the scribe by implication says yon may.
A certain Mr. Wordsworth (if I 'in right),
Snatching an interval from metric prose,
Describes, as seen by early morning light,
The view from Westminster (Lord only knows
Where he had been and spent the previous night),
And notes the way in which the river flows,
And tells us how it gives him quite a thrill
To feel the heart of London lying still.
I hold that this remark, however witty,
Is not in keeping with the actual case;
For if there is a period w:hen the City
"Lies " less than usual in the public's face,
'Tis when the homing Pressman (I submit he
Prefers the dark because his deeds are base)
Has cracked at coffee-stalls his stirrup-cup,
And Evening Journalists are not yet up.
There is a pause in the affairs of men,
Prior and just postorior'to the dawn,
When even those Great Powers that wield the pen
Are from mendacity a while withdrawn;
The early cock-bird calls his drowsy hen,
The earlier worm parades the dewy lawn;
But otherwise on each recumbent snorer
Sits what is known as " Nature's sweet restorer."
There are a few exceptions, by the way,
That emphasise the rule which I have stated;
The slim Field-Cornet, who has lied all day,
Lies on in darkness; having first located
Some unsuspecting Yeomen, he will say,
"Courage! our foes have just capitulated
To Europe's fleet: at present Temple Bar
Is occupied by Loubet and the Czar!"
That person surely spoke without conviction
Who impudently taught the vulgar view
That facts are even stranger stuff than fiction;
I never met a Correspondent who
Would willingly incur the grave restriction
Of only saying what he knows is true;
If facts should happen, they 're prepared to toll 'em;
If not,.they draw upon their cerebellum. - -
I have diverged from my initial attitude,'
But if you marked the measure I have used-
Lord B.'s (how irresponsibly he chatted !)—you'd
Count my digressions easily excused.
I now return to that pure well of platitude,
The leader-writer, whom Thave perused
• So rarely that my judgment cannot savour • • 7
Of prejudices rooted in nis favour.- -
I ask, as one who never yet has heard, ■ -
How is it done? what supernatural fires
Kindle his brain to stamp the final word
On matters piping-hot from off the wires.
Things which an hour ago had not occurred?
No answer comes, no outer tale transpires;
And I must fall, for want of information,
Heavily back on my imagination.
Picture him, then, by night, his collar loose,
His haunt by printer's devils close invested,
Swiftly exuding pancreatic juice
To make the facts more readily digested,
His cursive comments, almost too profuse,
Checked by a towel dripping round his pressed head;
And there you have (I'm told by those who read 'em)
The very fundament of British Freedom! O. S.
AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL.
Quietly, in an unpretentious but entirely pleasing manner, the
great Exhibition of 1851 has been celebrated at Sydenham.
Just half a century ago last May the Crystal Palace was opened
amidst great rejoicing in Hyde Park. The opening was to usher
in the millennium. As a matter of fact it didn't, but served as
an overture to one of the most ill-starred European wars of the
century. Then, after serving its proper purpose as a huge
international bazaar in the rear of Knightsbridgc barracks, it
was moved into Sydenhaih. Since then it has seen good and evil
fortune. Thanks to the present excellent management, the
good fortune remains and the bad days are half-forgotten
memories—save, perhaps, by the earlier shareholders—of the
past.
The good fortune is well j deserved. What can be more
interesting than the Courts, from the house in Pompeii to the
splendid Alhambra? Why, they contain a liberal education
in themselves. Then the series of exhibitions. All well
selected and instructive. And the concerts! Why, Mr.
Manns made the C. P. the headquarters of British music.
And the bands, and the organ-playing. And the picture
gallery. And last, not least, the catering. All good. Then
the local clubs housed in the Palace. Again good. And the
grounds and the fireworks. Then in the summer cricket, in
the winter football. Never was there such a place so sugges-
tive of delightful recollections. And during the past year
even the figures — once so disappointing — have been cheer-
ingly satisfactory. C. P., go on and prosper! Is there any
question? No. Stay! Is it absolutely necessary to have all
the year round a cafe chantant 1 Such an institution—no
doubt excellent in its way when judiciously conducted—seems
just a little out of place with such dignified surroundings.
"Writ in Error."—In Monday's issue of the Daily Tele-
graph, last week, an odd slip of the printer's appeared in the
advertisement of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Terry's Company, then
at the Kennington Theatre, playing Sweet Nell oj Old Drury,
which was announced as "Swell Nell of Old Drury." What a
capital title for a burlesque!

THE CASTAWAY.
(After the late It B .)
Goodbye! You will make this curt farewell
A rack for my soul and a tenter-hook
For my life-warm limbs! Well, the truth to tell,
I have read this page in the Future's book.
In the soft caress of your coal-black hair;
Yes, I stroked it tenderly, grant me that,
Lovingly,—watching the sunlight throw
Its jewels, and wondering why the dark shade
Of this parting thought ne'er obscured the glow.
"The time must come!" to myself I said,
In all our union the thought was there,
As the world is a ball I knew it pat.
A hundred times as you kissed my brow,
Wrung or serene with as many moods,
In as many places, where you, I trow,
Shone out the best of my chattels and goods,—
Full five score times,—did the doleful thought
Strike on my heart as the awkward oar
Of an unskilled sculler on Thamis' breast.
The thought: that you 're only a fair-weather friend,
Not for the atmosphere storm-possest
Lashing of hail, drip, drip without end,
But you for the set-fair seasons—in short,
A fair-weather friend, as I said before.
Only a fortnight ago to-day
Jonesulet bade me in grotesque tone
Throw you aside. But that's just his way,
To pluck out the rose when the perfume's gone.
By the blessed calendar there on the wall
Nearly a year has slipped into the void
Sith jackanapes BkI'n impatiently pursed
His lips in entreating that I'd forswear
Your kigses. In answer I merely cursed.
And, showing the rascal that I could dare,
Through the fashionable throng, before them all,
I wore you. And weren't the fools annoyed!
But that was last year. Now? Devil a word
Can aptly express what a change is here,
And many's the rascal has said, 1 've heard
—Now as you were—that I bought you dear.
Oh, I know I'm a man of the world, while you
Are nothing now, lifeless, not-wanted, cold:
But still you've a part in the world to play—
A doubtful ornament! Still you '11 deck
The coarse, dank hair of some scamp whose way
Is for tawdry grandeur. Poor colourless wreck!
And never again shall we meet, we two,
I who am young and you who are old.
Countless the sum in this world of ours
Of such as you are. And as like as peas,
Or, better, as weeds that affront the flowers
In our civilised garden of sloth and ease.
Keep in the town. In the country not one
You '11 find for your favours, depend on that.
You in the country! The notion is cruel.
'Mid natures cast roughly in earth's simple mould,
A mark you would serve for their newly-chopped fuel
Or crinson-veined wurzel hilariously bowled.
Such is the world! Yes, your reign is done,
Shabby, old, moth-eaten, worn top-hat!

SOMETHING LIKE A CURE.
{Notes from the blank pages of Mr. Briefless Junior's Fee Book.)
First Impression of Evian.—Absolutely French. No English
need apply. Commissionnairc of " One of the Best " hotels does
not speak English. However, he has the accomplishment—some-
what difficult of acquirement, I should think—of understanding
my French. Sometimes. Determine to patronise "One of the
Best." Fine situation, overlooking the lako. and on clear days
Ouchy to be seen. When Oueby is visible look out for squalls.
Sunshine deceptive. Rain to follow. Rain in autumn standing
dish. Seldom "off." No English, but plenty of hammering.
Discover later that chronic hammering is caused by continuous
bottling of waters of the Source. For exportation.
England at a Discount. — Through the kind offices of my
excellent doctor (Swiss) I am introduced to a French gentle-
man. Charming fellow. Very cheerful. He is not exactly in
the army—so far as 1 can gather—but when out of mufti wears
a uniform. Some Governmental appointment, requiring for the
proper performance of the functions attaching thereto a sword,
cocked hat and epaulets. On Sundays and holidays, probably
(in addition) spurs. He is quite proud of not understanding
English. He is equally proud of never having been in England.
What does he want with London, Leicester Square, Vauxhall
Bridge Road and Margate? Has he not France? Is he not a
Frenchman? What would I have more? I reply in my French
—as spoken in Paris—tray bong.
How I am to be Cured.—I am to rise at six. Then to the
Source, where I am to drink three glasses of water. A quarter
of an hour's walk between each. For thr> rest, a simple diet
and more glasses of water when (like Mrs. (samp) "I am so
dispoged." It appears that the purj air and the perfect peace
will do the rest. Evian water in the town everywhere. You
find it in your matutinal tub. It forms the basis of splendid
soup. It is extremely pleasant in your tea.
At the Source.—Water drinkers walking. Continuous stream
at drinking fountain. Table containing fancy glasses sugges-
tive of "Present from the Crystal Palace," mugs "For a
Good Boy, from St. Leonards," and the like. Presiding goddess
preparing tumblers enquires courteously if I am a subscriber.
She speaks in French. I answer in French—as spoken in Paris
—Wee, Madarm. Am presented with a glass of water. Drink
it. Cold, pleasant, excellent. Take my first quarterof an hour's
walk. Stroll leisurely over half of Evian and back. Five
minutes to spare. Second glass of water. Take my second
quarter of an hour's walk. Stroll leisurely over the other half
of Evian and back. Five minutes to spare. Third glass of
water. Look nt French paper. News about England a
twentieth of a column. Takes a minute and a half to read. Rest
of the last quarter of an hour consumed in getting back to
"One of the Best." Uphill.
Distractions.—It is the end of the season, so the Casino is
"slowing down." Placards of past glories tell of theatrical
performances in which Mounet-Sully, Coqi'klin and Rkjane
have taken part. Grand orchestra still going strong—especially
in the brass. Chemin de fer—attracting (between the first and
second parts of the afternoon band programme) a number
of one-franc to five-franc speculators. Try my system.
Result: loss in five minutes, sixteen francs. Stupid game,
Chemin dc fer. Think—in French—speedy condemnation. Put
more briefly, naughty swear word. Further distraction-—Little
horses. Back two, then six, then four, then seven, then eight.
Result: loss of twenty francs. Say, in English, naughty
swear word. Attracts no attention. Giddy throng of foreigners
do not understand a single word of English. No, not widest-
known word in the language! Stupid game, Little horses.
And this is not following doctor's orders. Prescription for
cure—plenty of water and perfect peace. Losing thirty - six
francs in ten minutes may be getting into hot water, but
certainly not perfect peace. Naughty swear word!
A Festival.—In spite of the fast approaching end of the season,
Evian very gay with a visit of travelling doctors. So far as I can
make out, medical men from all parts of the world—minus the
British Empire—are " doing " the Sources of Lac Leman. They
are personally conducted by a gentleman in a suit of tweeds
and a red ribbon button-hole. They hold a conference anent
the Source of Evian. Perfect stranger teaches the local doctors
the advantages of the eait minirale of the neighbourhood.
Local doctors no doubt much obliged for the startling informa-
tion. If time had permitted probably lecture on egg-sucking
(addressed to grandparents) would have followed. But social
side uppermost. Much music and a banquet. Last function,
final junketing of the personally-conducted medicos. An Evian-
curod guest thereat said to have subsequently undone all the
good of his course by partaking of too many entrees. Much
speech - making. Abrupt conclusion. Watches of the night
later on disturbed by doctors (and their belongings) missing
boats and trains. Naughty swear words in many languages.
Perfect Peace—No letters, no papers. Hourly application to
Concierge fruitless. The world seems to be standing still.
Reminded of the Strand and Fleet Street by finding an old copy
of somebody's Press Guide. Probably left by some agent travel-
ling in journals. "One of the Best" does not take in regularly
any English paper. Explanation—no English to read them.
Apparently never heard of the Thunderer of Printing House
Square, or the Young Lions of Peterborough Court, or the
Chronicles of the corner of Wellington Street! What ignorance!
The schoolmaster evidently not abroad. At least not at Evian.
Pleasing Joke.—Waggish friend writes to me saying that I
must be staying in an Eviauly place. Quite so.
LEAVES FROM AN AERONAUT'S DIARY.
April 1.—Flying machine just completed. A triumph of
ingenious construction. All my own invention. Material,
aluminium. Motor power, benzine. Success assured. Have
worked out the whole scheme on paper and find machine is
simply bound to fly. Only waiting for a calm day to demon-
strate the fact to a sceptical public. These March winds very
troublesome. Not fair to the machine to make its first trial
under unfavourable conditions. Shall make my ascent at noon
to-day, weather permitting. Have announced the fact in all the
daily papers.
Noon.—Lovely day for the ascent. Large crowd assembled
in Exhibition grounds, from which, by permission of the pro-
prietors, ascent to be made. Everybody keen and expectant.
Remain outwardly calm, but feel a curious sensation in pit of
stomach. Not fear, of course. On the contrary, confident I
shall succeed. A few friends gather round to wish me luck.
Shake hands with them, and step on board. A cheer is raised.
I give the word to let go. They let go.
Nothing happens! A slight hiteh, I explain to bystanders.
Can be put right in a moment. Only needs the turn of a screw
and I shall soar gracefully like a bird. Interval of expecta-
tion. Machine still declines to rise. Seems as if I was too
heavy for it. Must go into the question of proportion of
weights to horse-power again. Explain this to bystanders.
Ascent will take place to-morrow without fail. Crowd melts
away discouraged. Machine towed back to shed.
April 7.—Unexpected difficulties have delayed second experi-
ment. Turned out that motor had not sufficient power, and
rudder was too heavy. Have remedied both defects. Shall
certainly soar at midday to-day. Spectators not so numerous
as on last occasion, but interest still cordial. Weather un-
happily threatening. Towards noon wind rises. Postponement
again unavoidable. Most disappointing. Must wait for next
fine day.
April 12.—Fine days not so common in this country. Four
have passed and conditions still unfavourable. To-day more
promising. Machine in first-rate trim. Have been able to

make sundry minor improvements in
it during enforced delay. Once more
respectful crowd gathers, fit but unde-
niably few. Public temporarily losing
faith in my machine. As a friend of
mine explained, a flying machine which
not only doesn't fly, but doesn't even
kill its inventor, rapidly ceases to be
an object of popular curiosity. At the
timo I pretended to smile at this, but
looking back upon it consider the plea-
santry in doubtful taste. Twelve o'clock
strikes. I start in half-an-hour.
12.30.—Once more I take my stand
proudly on the deck of my machine.
Reporters grouped round me in dense
phalanx watching proceedings and avid
for copy. Once more I give the signal.
The anchor is loosed, the screw begins to
revolve. "We are certainly rising. I lay
my hand on the tiller, prepared to steer
proudly as soon as we have risen above
the heads of the people. Process of soar-
ing somewhat slow. Would like to in-
crease number of vibrations of screw,
but hesitate to leave the rudder. How-
ever, we are certainly flying, though
flying somewhat low. Crowd raises a
cheer. Most exhilarating. Not much
steerage way yet. Narrowly miss a tree.
Wall straight in front. Shall we clear it?
Afraid not. Decide to put about instead
and skim gently back to starting point.
Problem arises, how to get down.
Never thought of this before. All very
well to say "let her down gently"; not
so easy. Might misjudge velocity and
smash delicate mechanism. On other hand,
might underestimate speed of descent and
never get down at all. Decide to proceed
cautiously. Slacken speed. Pall like a
stone in a moment, right in the middle of
representatives of the Press. All jumped
clear however. Most unfortunate. Might
have landed on some of thein and broken
the fall. As it is machine a total wreck
and self badly shaken. Ominous murmurs
among reporters, who seem to think I
did it on purpose. Offer my apologies.
Accepted ungraciously. Promise to under-
take further ascent as soon as machine
can be repaired or new one made ready.
April 30.—New machine built at last.
Old one proved past mending. Sold for
scrap-iron, or rather scrap-aluminium.
Gathering of spectators considerably
larger, encouraged presumably by pros-
pect of seeing me break my neck. Re-
porters . havo selected somewhat distant
part of field for watching progress. Havo
decided to modify conditions of tho start.
Now machine built like a ship, decked
all over, and will start from the surface
of convenient pond. This makes ascent
equally easy and guards against worst
consequences of descent. At midday am
rowed on board in small boat. Make short
speech from deck of machine, pointing out
that conquest of air is at length complete.
I have only to turn lever and machine will

rise like the admired albatross. Proudest
moment of my life! Turn lever. Screw
revolves. Wo don't seem to rise. On the
contrary, we are actually sinking. We have
sunk! Am rescued, half drowned, by man
with boat-hook. Sensation most disagree-
able. Machine remains at bottom of pond.
Long may it do so. Shall give up flying
and tako to croquet. St. J. H.

Last week the common circumstance
Of meeting drew from you a glance,
From me a stately bow.
Your mien was dignified and grand,
I touched your languid, high-held hand,
'Twas all you would allow.
Alas! since then stern Kato has dealt
A wanton stroke; we each have felt
A cruel and heartless blow.
The self-samo hand our joy has killed,
Our brow has wrung, our breast has filled
With deep and dreadful woe.
This week, by mutual sorrow torn,
Each feels towards tho other drawn
By misery's mystic charm.
Pity, they say, to Love's akin —
Then what a world of Love lies in
A vaccinated arm!

Daughter of Sea Kings !—your line running down to them,
Gallant and sturdy, the Vikings of old;
Foomen who fought with us, adding a crown to them,
Launching their galleys for glory and gold :—
Wife of a Sailor !—a man who is one of us,
Made by the Navy, its smooth and its rough,
Pleasures and labours ;—be sure there are none of us
Wish he were made of a daintier stuff!—
Mother of Princes !—and wo have a plea for them;
Lend us your children, we '11 give them back, men!
Born to the blue, there's no trade but the soa'for them,
Wonders and wisdom 'twill bring to their ken :—
Princess of Britons ! we heard how they bore for you,
Gifts that were royal and gauds that were rare;
We have no jewels, no riches in store for you,
Only of homage we proffer our share.
Queens of your race, in the tale of its history,
Marshalled their armies and mustered their ships,
None of them learned of the sea and its mystery,
S n of the yes and not heard from the lips.
Came there the call of our kindred, the brotherhood
Dwelling afar, but in loyalty near;—
"We would be one, O our Queen, in thy motherhood,
Send us thy dearest, we hold them as dear!"
Then by the way of the wonderful waters,
Won by our fathers who fought on the foam.
Fared you to hearten our sons and our daughters,
Folk who are fain at the thought of their home.
So, as you saw, in the days of your wandering,
Nations of landsmen as loyal as free,
Haply there rose, in the time of your pondering,
Thoughts of the sailors whose home is the sea.
Royalty spared you no whit of our dreariness,
Wanting the touch of our little ones' hand;
Daytime and darkness of watching and weariness,
Waiting for wives who are waiting on land.
Aye, and wo knew it, and so did you win of us
Titles confirmed by a royal decree,
Neptune himself he has hailed you as kin of us,—
"Princess and Lady of Men of the Sea!"
Take then, O Princess, the tribute we bring to you,
Simple and homely, as simple our part;
Hear then, O Lady, the song that we sing to you,
Songs must ring true when they rise from the heart!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Rudyard Kipling's Kim (Macmillan & Co.) is a strangely
fascinating tale of Indian life under British rule justly sus-
picious of foreign intrigue. The two principal characters in
the story are a simple, lovable, and holy "Lama," and his
"cAelah" (pupil and companion), a bright, unscrupulous,
affectionate, clever boy, who, his parents (one Sergeant Kimball
O'Hara and his wife, a nursemaid in a colonel's family) having
both died before he was three years old, was brought up by a
half-caste woman, and started by her to seek his fortune where
chance might lead him, with, as an outfit, an amulet ease hung
round his neck containing a parchment with prophetic writing
on it, and a birth-certificate by way of passport and for future
identification. The third principal character in the tale is the
sly, highly-accomplished Babu, in the Secret Service Depart-
ment of the British Government, whose peculiar " English as she
is spoke" will forcibly remind not a few readers of "Honble
Punch's " Anglo-Indian contributor, who, as it may be remem-
bered, had the rare opportunity of airing his knowledge of the
English language and of English Law in a London Court of
Justice, as defendant in a celebrated breach of promise action.
With his exceptional power of vividly picturesque description,
Mr. Rudyard Kipling sets so clearly before our eyes the dazzling
scenes of life in an Indian city, where the old order is only
gradually changing giving place to new, that we see every
figure, no matter how unimportant, sharply defined, and the
moving throng quivering with animation as in the "living
pictures" of the whirring cinematograph. Out of the ever-
moT.ing crowd, so wearying to eye and brain, as indeed is
every crowd in real life to the quiet spectator, issue four
personages whose steps we follow with increasing interest until
the end of the romance which still leaves the reader not
dissatisfied but unsatisfied, asking, as the inquisitive child does
after the very last word of a fairy tale has been uttered, "And
what did they do then?" The embossed illustrations by
J. L. Kipling are original in design and peculiarly effective.
Itickerby's Folly (Methiien) is a rollicking, rough-and-tumble
story of the kind dear to the heart of the gallery in the old
transpontine theatre. Mr. Tom Gailon has in his wallet a
boundless store of devices, expedients and surprises which
carry the reader through at breathless pace. Never outside
the range of Iticfcerbi/'s Folly wore such happenings. Murders,
personations, abductions, incendiarism, a corpse falling out of
a casually-opened cupboard door, and a midnight burial by
lantern light—these are some of the delicacies my Baronite can
promise to the reader in search of a rattling, racy book.
The fifth volume of the New English Dictionary comes from
the Oxford University Press. It will appreciably add to its
renown, and to that of Henry Prowde, whose watchful care
and exquisite taste have endowed the nation with this rare
workshop. Dr. MURRAY, toiling through the alphabet, has to
regret the loss of one esteemed colleague fallen by the way.
This is Mr. PitzEdward Hall, who, dying at the age of seventy-
six, was within a few weeks of the end hard at work on the
Dictionary, service rendered as a pure labour of love. The
new volume completes the first eleven letters of the alphabet,
comprising four of them within its mighty tome. They are H,
I, J, K. My Baronite notes with interest how the letter H,
persistently dropped by some of his fellow-citizens, comes out
well ahead in the Dictionary. It prefaces over 16,000 words, as
compared with 14,000 I's, 3,500 K's and 3,000 J's. In this new
word competition, Dr. Johnson wasn't in it with Dr. Murray
and his army of collaborateurs. Compared with the above
figures, Johnson's dictionary deals with 1,538 words beginning
with H, 2,012 with I, 299 with J, and 205 with K. As a rule, a
dictionary is not attractive in the ordinary way of reading-
Complaint of patchiness has justly been brought against it.
The New English Dictionary, beautifully printed, is a museum
of fascinating out-of-the-way information, supplied through the
medium of quotations illustrating the use and meaning of words.
The complaint my Baronite makes about the book is that, turn-
ing to it for elucidation of a word, he finds the page so fasci-
nating that he goes on reading when he ought to be writing.
Mr. Ernest Radford, with his instructive preface to
Boswell's Life of Johnson, leads the reader up to where Mr.
Augustine Birrell, K.C., self-effacing, "introduces" him to
the present six-volume edition (Archibald Constable & Co.)
of that immortal work, fringed afresh with illuminative
notes, and illustrated with some eighty well-reproduced por-
traits of contemporary Johnsonian «elebrities. In the course
of above-mentioned preface, the aforesaid Ernest, touching
upon the portrait, by Sir Joshua, of "Gartano Apolline
Bald ass a RE Vestris, 1729—1808, Le Dieu de la Danse," writes:
"His son Amand, Ballet-master, King's Theatre, Haymarket,
married Bartolozzi's daughter, who afterwards married Charles
Mathews the elder." If this were so, who, then, was the
"Madame Vestris" whom Charles Mathews the younger, i.e.
Charles James Mathews, married, and with whom he managed
the Lyceum Theatre somewhere about 1846, " Consule Planco,"
which, being literally translated, means when Planche was
their consultant, and wrote their Christmas extravaganzas?
The Baron has ever been under the impression that Madame
Vestris was a Bartolozzi, and that her second husband was
Charles James.Mathews, the Charles Mathews of Used Up,
Patter v. Clatter., and a hundred other amusing pieces, the
youthful friend of Lady Blessington and Count D'Orsay in Italy
and London. If the Baron be right his Charles Mathews, husband
of Madame Vestris, was not the "elder" (Heavens! he, the
ever-green, never could have been an "elder," since, though
he lived till nearly eighty, he had not attained to the positive
"old "), but the younger. There's an error somewhere. Whose?
"Our Mr. Anstey" has republished in one volume (Long-
mans) his original Man from Blankley's — not the dramatic
version—with several "other sketches," all so delightfully
amusing that it is difficult to select any single one as " the
pick of the basket." As a rule the Baron approvcth not of
illustrations, as forcing upon the reader types that do not seem
in accordance with the author's intention. But this instance is
a brilliant exception, all the characters, as humorously realised
and perfectly presented by tour Mr. Bernard Partridge," ap-
pearing not only just exactly as the author of their being would
in real life have had them appear, but also as the appreciative
reader would have necessarily imagined them to be. Certes, to
author and artist, the Baron tenders his sincere congratula-
tions, as also does he to the public on their having so enjoyable
a work within such easy reach. The Baron de B.-W.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAPJVARI.
A MUCH INJURED MAN.
Chapter III.
I cast about for a propitious chance of proposing to the
heiress. Finally, I decided that no better time could be found
than the afternoon of a non-hunting day. And for the place,
what could be more suitable than the cosy little drawing-room
of the girl's own house?
I hacked over there on my white-faced horse, having had him
done over with the paint, and, leaving him to be walked about
by a boy, I knocked, and was shown in. Well, thought I to
myself, luck is in my way, as the brunette entered the room
alone.
"Poor Minnie has a headache," she began, as we shook
hands and then drew seats up to the fire. "So she has sent me
to entertain you and make her excuses."
"Miss Acresby could not have found a better substitute!"
I replied gallantly, and with a certain look in the eye which I
fancy always " takes " with women. Women all like it, in me.
"Shall I give you some tea?" she said.
"I want you to give me something more than tea, Miss
Acresby," I said.
She pretended to look puzzled.
"Muffins ?" she asked.
"More even than muffins," I answered, infusing a tremble
into my deep, full-toned voice. "I want you to say that this
pleasant friendship of ours, my dear Miss Acresby—my dear
Maud—let mo call you Maud, may 1? I want you to say
that this friendship of ours has now ripened into something
worse—better, I mean—than friendship alone—that, in fact, we
may—nay, must be—more to each other than we have ever
been before."
Bather a neat and effective little speech, that. I thought so
at the time, and I think so still.
Maud Acresby's eyes fell to the tips of her shoes. They
were very pretty ones—the eyes, not the shoes: though, on
second thoughts, I remember the shoes were also very pretty;
but let that pass. She did not answer a word.
"Am I hoping—asking for—too much?" I went, on, impres-
sively.
Still no answer.
"Maid!" and again I had resort to the tremolo, "I love
you! Will you be my wife?"
"Max!" That was all she said; but the next moment she
was in my arms. I had triumphed; her subjugation was com-
plete. The radiant flush of victory was on my cheek; at least,
1 think it was ; and never have I felt more utterly happy than
at the moment in which I told myself that Maud Acresby—
and her fortune—were mine.
We sat together on the sofa—how I hoped that "Minnie"
would not recover from her headache, and come in! And for
the space of at least half-an-hour, I enjoyed something like
bliss unalloyed.
Then, her hand still In mine, Maud said:
"I wonder where we shall settle down to live? Not in a
hunting country, dear Max, do you think so? It would be too
maddening to see others hunting, when one couldn't do so
oneself."
I patted the little hand encouragingly.
"I should never be so selfish as to object to your hunting,
dearest, simply because you were married," I said.
She looked rather puzzled.
"But, Max, hunting is expensive, and wo"
"Well, money would hardly stand in the way, would it?" I
asked, laughingly. De Thode always says my laugh is infec-
tious, and I think he must bo about right. Anyhow, my little
flance'e laughed merrily, too, and exclaimed:
"I'm so glad to hear you say that, Max, for I love hunting,
and could only have given it up for your sake"—(dear little
girl! By Jove, women can tell a real good fellow when they
see one)—"and I thought—I rather feared, dear Max, that you
wouldn't be able to afford me hunters as well as yourself.
However, I'm only too glad to hear that you can. What jolly
days we shall have together, sha'n't we?" and she clapped
her little hands with delight.
"Yes, awfully jolly," I said, in rather feeble tones. I did
not quite like the reference to myself as the provider of the
hunters. I supposed it was merely her way of putting things.
"Dear Max," she went on, laying her head against my
shoulder and gazing up at me with her dark, star-like eyes, " I
jimst tell you—it was such a shame—people said you were"
"My darling!" I exclaimed, in outraged tones.
"Don't be angry, Max. 1 never believed it. They said you
were not in love with anything except yourself and 'the
heiress's money.' I felt furious at such vile calumny."
"The scoundrels !" I said, in hot indignation.
"Yes," she resumed; "and now, when they see that it was
me, and not the heiress at all that you my darling, what is
the matter? You are ill, you"
I wiped the cold perspiration away from my forehead.
"No—o," I said, weakly, " but I feel rather—rather cold."
I could almost have wished that Minnie icoiifd recover from
her headache and come in. It might have relieved the strain
and created a divertissement. Now that I come to calmly reflect
over the whole of the proceedings, I am distinctly of opinion
that Minnie must have purposely cultivated that headache in
order to leave us—Mai d and myself — alone, on that fatal
afternoon.
"When will you come to see me again, dear Max?" she
cooed, softly.
"I—er—oh, soon, dear Maud, very soon," I replied, vaguely,
and with a groping movement—for I felt almost blinded with
my sudden grief—making for the door.
"I am sure you are not quite well," she said, with anxious
solicitude, and just that (to me) terrible soupfo?i of proprietor-
ship in her tone, that engaged men know so well.
I nodded and smiled, in sickly silence.
Feeling that the quiet of my own rooms at "The George"
was what I chiefly valued in life at that moment, I rose and
said good-bye. M ai d accompanied-me to the door—so nice of
her, of course, but I was past appreciating the delightful
flattery of such an act, just then. The boy met me with
my hack—the painted one—and but for the fact that " melan-
choly had marked me for her own," 1 might have noticed that
it had been raining, and my horse's face was again white.
Maud, ever quick in observation, exclaimed:
"Oh, you've had another horse sent over for you, then? I
saw you ride up to the house on " *
"Yes," I broke in, as I hurriedly climbed up into the saddle.
"It—it's a beastly day, isn't it. Good-bye." Hero I felt
something rise in my gorge, but I persevered and ended the
sentence with "dear." Then I rode off home as if the devil
had kicked me.
Of course, I saw it all now—now that it was too late. That
unmitigated scoundrel, Gadsby, had introduced the companion
as the heiress; a shabby, stale, threadbare trick. Gadsby had
leftSplashington, or I should have—well, I should have written
him an abusive, anonymous letter, by Jove, I would!
I sat down and thought out the whole situation until my
head ached. What was I to do? Could I apply to some friend
to get me out of the difficulty by explaining that there was
some mistake somewhere? No, it was not a mistake which
would bear explaining. Should I run away? Should I commit
sui ?No, certainly not that. Well, then what on earth was
the best course to take? I couldn't confess the mistake I had
made; I couldn't tell my uncle, or he would cut me off with a
shilling. The only way I could see out of the difficulty was
the one I decided upon taking, then and there. I seized writ-
ing materials and began :—

My Dear Miss Acresby,
I hardly know whether I made myself quite clear to
you to-day. When I proposed that you should marry me,
what I meant to say was, would you marry me at some future
time if—I mean—when—or rather, to make the matter even
simpler—in the event of—my succeeding to my uncle's property
and Baronetcy—there are only seven lives between me and the
title—and one never knows one's luck, you know; they might
all be killed in a railway accident, or drowned in a butt—boat,
I mean. I hope I make myself clear?
I am sure you will see matters in the same light as I do;
and, although I may have asked you to marry me—you will
remember that nothing was actually said as to the date. So I
think, perhaps, it would be wiser to leave you, for the present,
at all events, entirely free—unless you care to remain engaged
to me until those seven lives drop in.
With every good wish for your future welfare,
I remain,
Yours very sincerely,
M. db Verb Bouncer by.
P.S.—As I am unexpectedly recalled to town to-morrow, will
you kindly make my adieux to your charming cousin, and
accept the same for yourself 1
P.P.S.—I shall very probably be starting for Equatorial
Africa next week.
To this I received no reply for over a fortnight, and was
beginning to think I had got out of a terribly awkward situa-
tion, -with my usual skill and address—for without any conceit,
I fancy I know something about the ways of the world—when
this letter arrived.

ACTUALITY.
(An Extract from a "probable" new novel.)
[" Probably one of the characteristic features of the new novel will be the
relegation of the element of rex love to a subsidiary place. It may be that
current fiction lias rather exaggerated the importance of the love of a man
for a maid. It is open to doubt if, in most lives, love is the be-all and end-all
of existence."—The Academy, September 24.]
Chapter XXXIX.—A Moment for Matrimony.
And so Pendleton Pigot was recognised by the whole world
as a fully-fledged multi-millionaire. And so young, too, for he
was barely forty-one, in spite of the grey flecks amid his well-
groometl hair. As he sat in his library, drawing dreamily at a
Floro di Lcviatlm.no, the whole of his busy life passed before
him like some wonderful pageant. The errand-boy at the
ginger-beer factory, the supernumerary stamp-moistener, the
toiling clerk, the commercial
traveller, the proprietor of a
greengrocery business, and so
on through the myriad com-
mercial labyrinths, until the
dizzy pinnacle of financial
success was reached, and he
floated the Empire and Battle-
ship Supply Association, and
stood revealed as the triple-
Napoleon of commerce.
Pendleton was a typical pro-
duct of the age — though a
high one: a man who had a
large grasp of our complex
life, and who early set him-
self to devote to everything
within his ken — which was
everything — just so much
time and mental energy as
its importance in the great
cosmic scheme justified. For
three hundred and sixty-four
days in the year he immersed
himself in the multifarious
problems which crop up in the
life of a young man deter-
mined to get on. On the
three hundred and sixty-fifth
Pendleton allowed himself to
bo bored by the unmonetary
business of domesticity, or,
to stretch a somewhat anti-
quated term, his love affairs. That day was near at hand,
and ho felt that a little relaxation from the more serious
duties of existence would only bo consistent with his admirable
rule of life.
He stretched out his hand and pressed the electric bell for
his secretary.
"By-the-bye, Ooleton," he said, as the young man entered,
"what was the name of that young lady I told you to
remember ?''
The secretary turned hastily some leaves of his note-
book.
"Miss Sylvia Flindries, Sir."
"Ah! 1 fancy I was rather struck by her general deport-
ment." A pause.
"It was at Monte Carlo, in '07, wasn't it?"
"The memo is dated June in the following year, Sir, at
Aix."
"Oh," said Pendleton, calmly. "One meets so many people.
I believe I jotted down a few particulars for future reference.
Have you them handy?"
ILLUSTRATED QUOTATIONS.
(One so seldom finds an Artist who realises the poetic conception.)
The secretary found them and road as follows :—
jNliss Sylvia Flindries. Aix. '98.
Matrimonial Advantages. Matrimonial Disatlvanta
Tall, brunette. Invalid mother (loquaciou'3'
Well connected. Father overbearing.'
Nice voice, features, and figure. Brother an absolute fool.
Dresses well. Will sing and read novels.
Tactful and easy in manner. A dash of sentiment (bad).
Vivacity. Mode of life and tastes—simp
Age 26, or thereabouts. Fond of theatre and socioi,
functions.
Note. When thinking of marrying worthy of a trial.
Pendleton expelled a cloud of smoke cogitatively.
"Just type a note, Ogleton."
"Are you thinking of marrying, Sir," enquired he with
the privilege of an old employe.
"I had some such idea,"
answered Pendleton, with a
half smile of good nature. "If
you remember, next Wednes-
day week is the one day set
aside out of the year for
such trivialities as infect our
modern life. Matrimony is
one of them, to which love-
making was an insensate
preliminary in my boyhood's
days, and a great deal of the
fiction concocted during that
flimsy period of our history
was devoted to it. I intend
to get married. I have been
meaning to do so for some
years past, but being occu-
pied by so many important
affairs has put the idea out
of my head. It's a thing I
believe one ought to do, so
I want to do it, and have
done with such nonsense
once and for all. Just drop
a nice note to Miss Flindries,
enclosing in tabulated form
my conception of her advan-
tages and disadvantages, and
say I intend to get married
on Wednesday week, and
would be/happy to give her
the first1 refusal of myself.
Ask her to enclose the last six photos s'.he has had taken of
herself, as 1 only vaguely remember what she is like. Say
that I consider she could be adapted to my few domestic
wants, and if she is desirous of seeing my houses and
property I should be most happy to personally conduct her
over them, and reply to the best of my ability to any questions
she may think it necessary to ask.
"Remind Miss Flindries of all the sources for acquaint-
ing herself of my character, and enclose extracts from
red books, etc., with a stamped and addressed envelope
in case of rejection. State that an early reply will oblige,
as in the event of Miss Sylvia Flindries declining my
offer, I have other ladies on my list (though I freely con-
fess none with so few disadvantages) to whom a similar
offer will be extended. That is all. I shall leave all the
details of the ceremony in your hands. Remind me that I
have an appointment to be married on Wednesday week,
and post me up in the bride's family history. And now we
can return once more to the normal features of our modern
civilized life."

'Out, damned spot !"—Macbeth.

WHAT WE DO WITH OUR BOYS.
Rkally, Mr. Grey, it's most kind of
your wife to take so much trouble. But
everyone spoils Marjory. Ah, you think
so? So glad! And yet I'm very anxious
about her. Oh, dear no, she's delight-
fully good and obedient, and all that, so
different from Percy. But then, girls are
different, are they not? But still — you
have no daughters of your own, I believe?
Yes? Ah, then, you can sympathise with
me. A mother's responsibilities are so—
so—exactly, so overwhelming, that some-
times one's heart fails one. But we can't
do more than our best for them, can
we? And some mothers are so — now
there's Lady Coote. You know her? Yes?
Exactly! And her one idea is to get
those red - haired girls married. She
thinks of nothing — nothing, but that.
Yes! So narrowing, ain't it? And the
way she hunted that poor cracked Lord
Sandown last year — positively hunted
him! Makes her look so ridiculous, don't
it? Ah yes, yes, of course. I suppose
my Marjory will marry some day. They
do, don't they? But what troubles me
is the—just so, the bringing her up to—
I suppose now, you believe in the Higher
Education of Women and all that? No?
Oh, but how nice of you to say so. And
yet, you know, there are people—now,
there's Isabel Southgate. I suppose
you don't know—yes, Sir Charles is my
cousin. Yes. Well, would you believe
it, she is positively going to send her
girls to Newnham, or one of those places.
Yes, really. And they are actually going
to take up teaching themselves. Now
can you conceive anything more — of
course, I only mean as regards women.
Your case is'so different. I always think
yours is such a noble profession. Oh,
but it is. So—er—so unselfish. Yes!
Boys are so difficult, ain't they?
Now do tell me what you think of my
PERCY. Ah, you've noticed that? High-
spirited! Yes! How I envy you that
gift of reading character. Directly you
spoke to him I could see that you would
get on beautifully together. He certainly
has rather high spirits, hasn't he? Yes!
But, of course, all his father's family are
like that, you know. Yes, poor Lord
Patrick. "Very sad, wasn't it, and so
disagreeable for the family. But it was
all the fault of that terrible old dowager.
The way she neglected her children, when
she wasn't spoiling them. Well, what
else could one expect?
But I feci quite happy about Percy,
now that I know he's in such good hands.
I always think, you know, that a mother
is really the last person in the world to
train her own boys. Of course, yes, so
many other things to think of, hasn't one?
And they 're so noisy, ain't they, and
always getting into mischief. Exactly.
Nothing elso for them to do, is there?

Lady Sneerwell. "Have your dauohters accomplished much in music?'
Unfortunate Falter. "Yes—the tenants below have moved."
The end of the holidays is always such a
relief. It's so—so restful to think that
someone else is looking after them.
Someone one knows and trusts, of course.
But really, your influence over boys is
quite—oh, but how delightful of you.
Now, I've never thought of that before.
How simple! Yes, I see. Just to love
them all. To love them. That must make
it so delightfully easy. Let me see,
haven't you a little Conyers boy here?
Yes? And you love him? Really?
Really! Well, now, that is too dear of
you. I must tell Marjory. Ah, here
they are.
Well, darling? And you liked it all?
I'm sure it is. And I feel so happy about
Percy. Mr. Grey has just been telling
me the secret of his influence. Can you
imagine anyone loving—really loving—
that unfortunate boy of Mabel Conyers?
Ah, well then, you are like Mr. GREY.
I'm sure I couldn't. But he says he loves
them all, and—oh, Marjory, do you hear
that? The more disagreeable they aro
the more ho loves them. Wonderful!
I'm sure after that we can have no qualms
about leaving Percy in Mr. Grey's hands.
Now, darling, if we 're to catch our train
I think we ought to be—oh, by the way,
my husband is rather particular about
religious viows,—not too high, you know.
Yes? But that's a great relief. And
they say their prayers and that sort of
thing? Yes? How nice! Oh, and will
you be so kind, Mrs. Grey, as to see that
he wears his thick Jaegers? Nonsense,
Percy, they don't tickle. Ho's always
so tiresome about them, Mrs. Grey, but
I'm sure he '11 do what you tell him. Well
now, we really must be—Goodbye, my
darling boy. Goodbye, Mr. Grey; I have
so enjoyed our little chat. So glad you 'ro
not too high. Good-bye. G. F. C.

It seems a shame, and WEO's to blame
When we cannot get our pay?
SOMETHING LIKE A CUEE.
(Notes from the blank pages of Mr. Briefless Junior's Fee Book.)
Tlie End of the Season at Evian-les-Bains.—Owing to pressing
work in Chambers (looking out for chances in the Vacation) I
have come a little late to Lac Leman. My hotel, " One of the
Best," is " slowing down." The lift is only half working. You
may go up, but unless compelled by force majeure you may not
come down. But force majeure can be created by an occasional
tip to the lift man. Then the Commissionnaire, resplendent in a
gold cap and Swiss general's green uniform, performs unusual
offices. In the early morning, on my way to the Source, I find
him in our under-stableman's mufti, seemingly in the absence
of a dismissed fellow-servant, hard at work washing windows
with a mop. Then the Restaurant visitors are turned into the
table d'hote room. This is a proof that the season is nearing
the end.
Society at "One of the Best."—There are three sets. The
first is composed of the Restaurant people who have either made
better bargains or pay more money than the table d'hoters.
They sit in a separate apartment to the latter, and have the
same meals but with more flowers and candles. On the strength
of the additional flowers and candles they look down upon the
table d'hoters. The table d'hoters, the second set, regard with
supreme contempt (on the strength of having better tables to
themselves) the common or garden all-at-one-long-board people.
When the Restaurant people are turned out of their special room
(closed for the season) the table d'hoters and others are levelled
up. All have small tables and all have more flowers and lights.
The Restaurant people unbend, and the hotel contains a happy
family, which daily becomes small by degrees and, as the hours
of departure by boat and rail arrive, beautifully less.
Against Doctor's Orders.—Those who go to Evian for the cure
must bo careful to avoid making friends amongst the residents.
If you are not careful you run the chance of being killed by
kindness. Invitations here, invitations there, invitations
everywhere. Charming music at a chateau. Pleasant talks in
an orchard. Delightful soirees en ville. But against doctor's
orders. You are to bo quiet and forget the gay world. But
that you cannot do. This when you are proffered the most
gracious and graceful hospitality? So when visiting Evian for
the cure, keep to the role of "The Stranger."
The Cessation of the Casino.—Owing to the close of the season
Evian is losing its gaiety. The Casino has given up its band
and "distractions." You miss the chance of losing thirty
francs in ten minutes. You are sorry at the disappearance of
the grand orchestra with its marvellous (I fancy fifty) musicians.
First wont the lady who played the harp. Then a number of
strings. Then a good half of the whole strength of the com-
pany. Then the conductor. Even the young lady who gives
you glasses of water at the entrance to the rooms has dis-
appeared. Only tho placards recording past features remain.
But it is cold comfort to know how gay Eviau was in August
when you are on the road to November.
From Land to Water.—But still wo have tho boats on Lac
Leman. You can make the tour du Lac. You get on board a
vessel that would give points (not many) to the Thames steamer,
and buy twenty francs worth of journey by the kilometre. You
wish to make the tour of the lake, and at once a portion of your
card is cut off and stamped. The journey by the kilometre is a tip.
You save a third or two-thirds (I forget which) of the ordinary
expense. Once on board you possess yourself of a guide-book
and read up the beauties of your surroundings. You are to see
mountains, valleys, old castles, churches, chateaux, waterfalls,
all lovely beyond compare. This you would do were it not
for lunch. While you are passing (seated in a cabin) the most
romantic scenery imaginable you are eating a meal of four
courses and a dessert. Well, you know what it is like outside
—from the guide-book.
A Fellow Traveller.—I met him travelling from Evian to
Ouchy. He was full of tact. I spoke to him in French. He
understood me I Marvellous! Then he spoke to me in French,
and I understood him! Again marvellous I Then we discovered
that we were both born and bred Londoners. He had been
everywhere. He had during the past fortnight visited Naples,
Rome, Petersburg, Berlin, and was on his way to Brussels.
He had been twice to South Africa. He had been round the
world frequently. He told me all about Canada, India,
America, and Australia. He was full of information. He
seemed to have been always on the move. I remembered the
old legend of the world-wide wanderer, but he did not look in
the least like the hero of that painful story. My better seven-
eighths whispered, "Evidently a diplomatist." I was inclined
to agree with her. French is the language of the Foreign
Offices—at home and abroad—and he understood my French.
Wonderful tact!" I beg your pardon, Sir," said I, " forgive
me for asking, as a comparative stranger, what I trust you will
not consider an impertinent question. But, how are you con-
nected with Downing Street? Do you carry despatches? Are
you in the Diplomatic service?" "Oh, no," replied my fellow
traveller, with a shrug of polite contempt. "No, nothing of
that sort. I travel in lavender water."
On the Wing.—I have stayed a whole fortnight, and my kind
doctor (Swiss) tells me I may go home. Cured? He hopes so,
and so do I. I give notice at "One of the Best." The gentle-
man who keeps the books seems deeply obliged. On the
strength of our departure I fancy a deputy cook and a chap
who sweeps up leaves in the grounds are dismissed—until
next season. We bid adieu. First to our kind and hospitable
friends. Then to the constituents of Evian. I give a list of
those who receive tips. Two chambermaids. Man who brings
in the matutinal tub. Man who brings in the complete tea.

who pretends to know all about it, "the beauty of the Evian
water is this: it brings everything out of you. It will dis-
cover all tho ailments under the sun—if you have them. All
you have to do after taking your course is to wait. The Evian
water is deliberate. You don't know at once. Wait for a few
weeks and then you will know what's the matter."

HOW IT STRIKES A
TEMPORARY.
CON-
II.—0/ "The Spectator," regarded at a
sensational organ.
["Gentlemen, there is something cruelly com-
plete in all the circumstances of this nine days'
imposture. A respectable weekly newspaper—
(laughter)—of blameless antecedents—(laughter)—
and growing infirmities—(laughter)— was selected
at once to be its vehicle and its victim. It was a
piquant variation of those stories about. . . eccen-
tric members of the animated creation with which
the journal is in the habit of regaling its unsophis-
ticated readers. (Laughter)." — Mr. Atquith on
the Rhodee-Schnadhorst correepondence in "The
Spectator."]
It is indeed an age of doubt,
Incredulous, iconoclastic;
The ancient creeds are dying out,
Or growing daily more elastic;
We stand 'with folded arms and see
Our fondest, shapeliest idols shattered;
And wear a torpid apathy
Just as if nothing really mattered.
We note the pains that History takes
With certain hoary myths to grapple—
How truthful Alfred wrecked the cakes,
Or William Tell secured the apple;
And feel no rising in our gorge
Though faiths are left without a rag on,
Not though it seems that good St. George
Never competed with a Dragon.
Yet from the slump which overtook
The dear beliefs we used to cherish
One faith survived, and, hook or crook,
We swore it should not lightly perish;
All others might be melted in
The Higher Criticism's crater,
Our confidence we yet would pin
To our beloved and tried Spectator 1
For though a taste for Nature's "sports"
Had left it reckless how it sifted
The origin of those reports
Of puppies fabulously gifted,
At such impostures we connived;
We knew that they were faked at leisure
By country rectors who derived
From this employ a harmless pleasure.
In fact our organ's credit grew
More firm by this facetious column,
Because it called attention to
The general tone as strictly solemn;
We saw its wit was thus confined
Within the mute creation's borders,
While all its serious powers of mind
Were centred on the higher orders.
Why could not such a scheme suffice?
O blameless, O demure Spectator,
Lone vehicle of sound advice,
And virtue's prime perambulator I ,
Have you at last been led astray
Through momentary exaltation,
And gone the pestilential way
Of prints that traffic in sensation?
How did'you ever come to mix
In scandal aimed at Mr. Schnaduorst,

AN ENGLISHMAN'S HOUSE," &C.

PLEASE 'M, THAT DOG WAS SENT HEBE YESTERDAY AS A WEDDING PRESENT J AND NONE OF

Or try these giddy circus-tricks,
Hoop-flying, hobby-mounted, fad-horsed?
Feats that become a skittish wench,
With flaunting hose and flimsy skirt on,
Should not be practised by the Bench,
Or solid matrons reared at Girton.
You have your part; it is to preach
The value of the old convictions,
Or, failing this, at worst to reach
Our children's hearts with homely
fictions:
Need your respected ears be lent
To public Rumour's brazen trumpets?
No, no! come back, and be content
With tales of our prodigious dumb pets.

OVER THE SEA.
Dear Mr. Punch,—I read that two new
cures for sea sickness have just been
discovered; the one the eating of bananas;
the other, found out by Professor Heinz, of
Erlangen, who declares that the malady
proceeds from the lobe of the brain, and
that to avert it one has only to breathe
freely. As to the Professor's theory
about breathing freely, I can safely assert
that I never open my mouth so wide as
when crossing the Channel, but the
experiment is an unpleasant failure.
Your obedient servant,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 23, 1901.
LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. IV.—Herbert Welleslky Rossiter.
Some time ago, with nothing much to do,
It chanced that I was wandering through the City.
Something there was I wanted to put through,
But could not think of it, the more 'a the pity.
These great resolves which have no base to stand on
Are hard to act on, easy to abandon.
What hope inspired me? "Whither was I bound?
"Why had I left my West-End fellow mortals?
What brought me to the consecrated ground.
Close to the Mansion House's massive portals?
I could not say—I might have been a dumb thing—
Bat well I knew that there had once been something.
Ranged in a line, the buses seemed to fret
The City constable, their kind instructor;
■While each one's pole—so closely were they set—
All but impaled the previous one's conductor.
And all the busmen looked most unseraphie,
Thus blocked and hindered in the seething traffic.
I saw the brokers hurrying on their way,
Swift past the corners where the cunning touts hide;
I saw promoters pouncing on their prey;
I saw the Stock Exchange—at least its outside.
I heard the jobbers coax and curse and wheedle;
I saw the Bank, and, ah ! I saw its beadle.
Clerks with their downy faces too were there,
Sharp as the razors that they had no use for;
And well-fed men—I knew not who they were:
Such ignorance there's really no excuse for.
At any rate, the rather stout and balder men
I marked as Common Councillors or Aldermen.
My lingering gait, where most men seemed to race,
Struck mo at last as something almost shameless;
Amid this eager crowd there was no place,
It seemed, for one so indolently aimless.
Jostled by all this swift financial flurry,
I too, I thought, must rouse myself and hurry.
And so I scooted on like anything,
An air of resolution on my visage
Fashioned to make me like some merchant king
Intent to stamp himself at least on his age.
And in a step or two a change came o'er me,
And golden visions seemed to float before me.
And many other men, a motley crew,
Drawn, I suppose, by these ecstatic visions,
Along the City street were hurrying too,
Heedless of hindrance, reckless of collisions.
A questthey had and a resolve to win it:
"There's something on," I thought, "and I '11 be in it."
1 followed one who seemed to promise pelf:
It came from every pore in all his fat form;
And then, I know not how, I found myself
Seated upon a bench before a platform;
And there I found what I had long been seeking,
For Herbert Wellesley Rossiter was speaking.
Who knows not Herbert? He is of the men
Who made the Empire—not as Romans made it,
O^Genghis Khan or Alexander, when
With fire and sword they harried and invaded.
He worked—we have it in his own confessions—
By giving cheques and getting fat concessions.
His mind was most inadequately stored:
At school and college ho was dull and stupid.
Men he despised; by women he was bored:
He did not once, in fact, give way to Cupid.
He did no work, he did not seem for play made,
This hulking lout of very common clay made.
His wit was small; his wisdom seemed to lie
Mainly in jests that stung and jeers that hurt you.
For daily life his standard was not high:
Honour he scorned, and much derided virtue:
"Its own reward?" he sneered, "Too low the price is;
I much prefer the market rate for vices."
"Why strive, since strife makes heat?" he said: it
That money down was easier and cooler, [seemed
And so he drew his cheques, and paid, and dreamed
A world of dupes with Rossiter as ruler.
Those who outwitted him he liked, nor pitied
But only laughed at those whom he outwitted.
Oft had I wanted to behold this man,
Hero of countless anecdotes and stories,
Hear him expound some new financial plan,
Or tell the tale of all his ancient glories.
Till now from print I merely had inferred him,
And lo! by chance I sat and saw and heard him.
(To be continued.) R. C. L.
THE MAYOR AND THE MAJOR.
THE Mayor-elect of Portsmouth is one Major Dupree. Some
of the ratepayers would apparently have preferred another
candidate, Alderman Soott-Foster, but there is a smack of
nautical rhythm about the name of DUPREE quite appropriate to
Portsmouth. For instance—
The freedom of the boundless sea
Is now an heirloom of Dupbee.
Or again:
Oh! who will o'er the Downs so free,
With Portsmouth Mayor, the great Dupbee?
Or yet again:
I sing to you in minor key
Of one who's Major, named Dupbee,
A Mayor of Mare, that's the sea.
Or yet once more: ,
At Portsmouth town the Council, sager
Than anybody, chose the Major,
And, having whims and whams, Dupbee
Made Mayor and Major joined, you see.
All good health to the Major-Mayor! May his present depre-
ciation by his adversaries never be fostered for long. We are
perfectly certain that during his mayoralty Portsmouth will
not be a mere geographical expression, for he has the support
of the Licensed "Victuallers.
"MY 'OSSES."
Extract from the Travel Diary of Toby M.P.
Strictly speaking they are not his horses. By legal right,
derived from cash payment, they belong to his master, Sir
Philip. Charles is merely the coachman. But having been
in charge of the stables for seven years, he has come to look upon
all connected with that sacred locality as his private property,
the master being a perhaps indispensable adjunct. 1 often
share the box-seat with Charles, my place being, of course, the
lower one. I never descend to the further level trodden by
people who don't drive horses without a feeling of abject
inferiority.
Charles has rooted convictions on all topicy, and is not averse
to stating them. He doesn't think much of the present Ministry.
''They run in blinkers," he says; "which is well enough for

Dougal. "I'm thinkin', Sir, we'd as well be goin' home. There's no enough—er—light to catch another fish!"
a 'oss, but not the thing for a human being, much less for a
Cabinet Minister. Wot did they bring Roberts 'onie for?" he
sternly asks me.
"Why indeed?" I say, meanly shaking my head as if I had
long brooded over the problem and given it up as hopeless.
Bicycles ho despises; motor cars he abominates. His loyalty
is shaken by hearing that tho other day the Kino drove from
Windsor to London on a motor car, occasionally doing forty
miles an hour.
"I never cycle, much less moter," says Charles, in a tone
that speaks infinite contempt and distrust for those who do.
"A pair of 'osses like them now afore you is good enough
for me."
He speaks very nicely of his master, a feeling justified by
habit on the part of that person to keep his place.
"I will have good 'osses to drive," he said, "and Sir Philip
knows it. This pair—look at the gloss on the chestnut's coat—
if put up at Tatt'sills to-morrow would bring 500 guineas. If
I wasn't allowed the like of 'em I'd leave the shop. But then,
look what I do for 'em. There's four of us in the yard. But
lor ! what's four for six 'osses? It's elbow-grease that makes
that coat shine, and I stand by and see my fellers put it on."
Charles does not approve his master's choice this year of a
country house, albeit it is one of historic renown.
"The stables ain't a patch on them we had last year," he
gloomily remarks; "nor my quarters isn't neether. Only for
my 'ossos I'd take rooms in the village. But there, how could
1 be spared? There's dinner and tea to go and git, and where
would my 'osses be whilst I was feedin''! In a way, it's like
Kitchener, d 'ye see? He's put in charge of tho War now
Roberts has come 'ome,—though why the Government. . . .
Kitchener's made responsible by Chamberling for the business
of the War, and lie must be on the spot night and day. Sir
Philii' 's give my 'osses into my charge, and I'm alius on the
spot. But they 're poor rooms compared with those I had last
year. Wo'a, Lovely! Wo'a, lass!"
Throned on tho box of the landau, Charles casts an air of
severe respectability over the company seated within. To a
back view ho presents a blue coat with bright brass buttons;
a carefully brushed hat with a cockade; a shirt collar of the
stiffness of a wall and the height of a fence. How he gets his
head in and out of it no other man knoweth.
Some experts occasionally drive a pair of horses with the
reins held in tho left hand. Charles never. Driving is a
serious occupation, and must be conducted accordingly.
Charles, with his shoulders squared, his elbows akimbo, his
feet, with the toes slightly turned outward, firmly set on the
boards, with the pleased sun shining on his spotless white
breeches and his highly - polished top boots, always holds
the reins in both gloved hands.
"It looks easy enough," he said, rightly interpreting a glance
of admiration involuntarily falling on his figure and pose. "But
no one that 'asn't got to do it knows how my near 'oss pulls.
He's got no mouth at all. Come up, Lovely."
Toothsome.—Here is a chorus to delight a sufferer who is
expecting to bo fitted up with an entire ratelier:—
"Oh, that will be jaw-ful!"
Though, by the way, tho well-known concluding line of this
jubilant verse would not suggest a state of happiness to the
"wearer of the grin," as there would be neither meat nor
drink for the unhappy person whose new teeth, upper and lower,
should "meet to part no more!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 23, 1901.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Christmas is coming, there's no doubt about it; and as
Christmas gets nearer and nearer—'which is really quite
contrary to the genial and generous disposition of all past
free-handed Christmases with ■which the' Baron has been
intimately acquainted—so ought our hearts to expand and our
hands go out of our pockets, -with money in them, to pay, pay,
pay, and give pleasure to those young 'uns whose turn -will come
in time to do likewise and to give pleasure freely as freoly they
have received it. So to those in search of Gift Books the Baron
recommends The Adventures of a Japanese Doll, written and
capitally illustrated in colours and Anglo-Japanese style by
Henry Mayer (Grant Richards); also Fairy Tales from the
Swedish by H. L. BRjEKSTED (among which will be found some
variants of very ancient friends) with clever illustrations by
Kittelsen, Erik Werenskiold and Carl Larsson (Heinemann).
Then there is Old King Cole's Book of Nursery Rhymes (Macmillan
& Co., Limited, London and New York), with eccentric pictures
in colours by Byam Shaw, representing Had Peter Piper, the
mystery of whose embezzlement of " a peck of pickled pepper'' has
never yet arrived within measurable distance of being cleared
up; and there is "Hush-a-bye Baby " Americanized as " Rock-a-
bye Baby," and a number of other dear old nursery rhymes-that
the Baron, the Baroness, the Baronites, and the Baronitesses
would not willingly let die, all set out in clear print with
plenty of margin, just the very thing for nursery delight in the
present year of grace and, being carefully preserved, for
reflection in "The Coming By-and-By." Also, from the same
Macmillanery Co., we have Old Irishe Rimes of Brian
O'Linn, amusingly written and spiritedly illustrated by
Rosamund Praeger. Here, too, is The. Green Cat, by S. Ashton
(Simpkin, Marshall & Co., Limited), and illustrated by Dorothy
Furniss, who is to be congratulated on having made such strides,
such "grand strides," in her art that, " 'pon my life and soul, oh,
demmit," as Mr. Mantalini observed, the Baron could scarcely
believe his eyes when they informed him that he was not
admiring the humorous touches of the Harry Furniss pencil
but those of his daughter. Only here and there occurs a draw-
ing that H. F. pere could not havo done, except, perhaps, when
ho was the same age as his clever daughter who here exhibits
brilliant sparks of genius derived from the original Furniss.
The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson (Methuen), designed as a
supplement to the two volumes of his Letters, was to have been
written by his early and late friend, Mr. Sydney Colvin. "When
my Baronite recalls the admirable manner in which the Letters
were edited, there is'impulse to regret that the intention was
not carried out, regret increased on learning that the task was
abandoned owing to ill-health. Happily, a competent substitute
has been found in Mr. Graham Balfour. As a rule, a kinsman
is not the best man to undertake a biography. Mr. Balfour's
work is admirably done. Subjected to the fascination, amount-
ing almost to idolatry, which Stevenson exercised over all who
came in close touch with him, he, nevertheless, refrains from
ecstacy. He tells a plain unvarnished tale that enables those
of the outer circle to realise what manner of man was this
whose name filled, and will hold, a prominent place in English
literature. The story is frequently touched with infinite pathos.
Stevenson's life was an almost daily struggle with Death.
Several times he received what seemed a knockdown blow. But
he came up to the scratch again, cheerily re-commencing his
work at the place where, suddenly, he had been forced to lay
down the pen. He had an intense pleasure in being alive,
though he was peremptory and insistent on the conditions of
life. In his early days his ideal was realised in the Bohemian
latitude of Barbizon. Towards the end he found perfect peace
and rest in a remote island in the Pacific. "Life," he wrote,
in one of the letters that are in themselves the highest develop-
ment of the style whose perfection ho laboriously sought,
"is far better fun than people dream who fall asleep among the
chimney stacks and telegraph wires." In his closing years
Stevenson became the idol of the reading public at home and
in the United States. Samoa was a shrine. It is interesting,
and to some inglorious if not mute Miltons will bo encourag-
ing, to gather from Mr. Balfour's narrative how slowly recog-
nition came to this prince of writing-men. He began the
profession of literature in his sixteenth year, publishing anony-
mously an account of the Pentland Rising. Year after year ho
pegged away, but it was not till 1879, thirteen years after his
first essay, that he made something like a mark with his
Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes. He was in his thirty-
sixth year when he took the public by storm with The Strange
Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. After that he had a
triumphal march. Probably the fantastic story is not the
portion of his work which Stevenson, if he had his choice,
would select as the basis of his fame.
Tlie Wooing of Sheila, by Grace Rhys (Methuen), with its
strong sensational incidents, its deep pathetic tragedy, and
its light-hearted comedy dialogue, is one of the best as it is
certainly one of the most fascinating Irish stories the Baron
has had the pleasure of reading this many a day. The types of
Hibernian character are, for the most part, as novel as they
are original. Sheila is the sweetest of Irish maiden heroines,
as innocent as was the Colleen Bawn herself; while a parallel
character to her lover, Michael Power, it would be difficult to
find anywhere out of a farmstead in a somewhat wild part of
ould Ireland, and nowadays, but rarely even there. The de-
scriptions of scenery have all the charm of true poetic feeling.
Then there is Mick-a-Dandy the "born natural," own brother
to one of Charles Lever's best studios from Irish life, Tipperary
Joe in Jack Hinton, a wild, fanciful, lovable creature who
grows so dear to the reader that it is difficult to realise how
the author could have been so hard-hearted as to kill him before
the happiness of the lovers, with which Mick has had so much
to do, is achieved. A really delightful book, highly recom-
mended by the Baron.
The Diva, by Miss Annie Thomas (Mrs. Pender Cudlip), is an
entertaining novel of modern times. Plenty of action and
local colouring. A Veteran Servant of the Baron has perused
the book—so he says—with the deepest interest. One of the
ladies in the story is not unlike a twentieth-century Becky
Sliarp. But poetical justice comes in and sends her out of her
mind in lieu of installing her—as in Thackeray's romance—in a
Fancy Bazaar. The atmosphere of Kaki redolent. Altogether,
says the Veteran, &c, a book to be read. With pleasure.
In East of Suez, by A. Perrin (Anthony Treherne & Co.,
Limited). The authoress gives us a collection of cleverly-
written stories which, the Baron thinks it not too much to say,
for graphic description, sharp incisive sketches of character,
and effective dramatic situation, are second only to the Plain
Tales by Rudyard Kipling; while two or three of them run even
the best of Kipling's uncommonly close. Possessing the great
merit of brevity, the reader, with a clear three-quarters of an
hour ere the dressing-bell rings, can get through any one of
these stories in that space of time, only he will find his literary
appetite so sharpened for another tale that only a still sharper
appetite for dinner will compel him to put aside the book as
one "to be continued in his next" leisure moment.
The Baron de B.-W.
P. S.—My juniorest Baronitess informs me that Christmas
Cards and Calendars, all of the most elaborate kind, are once
again offered to the public by Raphael Tdck and Sons. Of the
various Calendars^the most ingeniously devised specimen is the
"Sedan Chair," which will be generally welcomed as a charm-
ing Christmas present.
A Credit-able Suggestion.—Bilkins {reading from paper .

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 23, 1901.
SIR DUCKIE;
Or, Richard never was himself again.
(Being a fragment from a very free adaptation of a scene in a
recent novel by an eminent authoress.)

"Oh, Dodger!" Lady Hen Partlett cried. "Oh, Dodger!
what is it?"
And he told her, repeating, with but a few omissions, the
statement made to him by the doctor ton days ago.
"Your little one is—a duck," said Dodger Twentistun.
Lady Hen was very still. She made no cackle. Once the
feathery plumage gave a shuddering rustle.
That was all.
At last it was over.
Then Dodger, swearing a little under his breath, stole out.
"A duck! my pretty chick, a duck!"
Lady Hun arched her beautiful head, thrusting her beak under
her wing, as she murmured—
"This comes of employing a quack doctor 1"

But the little one, once launched, got on swimmingly, its
mother watching it anxiously from the brink of danger through
many a chapter of accidents.
FINANCIAL FOLLIES.
Hints to Chairmen.
When things are bad and language strong
From Shareholders who've suffered long,
And hopelessly the Company is floundering in the mire;
Should they attack Directors' fees,
Then let your manner slightly freeze,
And say, " I think tho labourer is worthy of his hire."
Suppose of proxies you've a lot,
Then let your speech grow rather hot,
Assert that you would simply scorn to leave a sinking ship;
Say, "Since I've got the helm in hand,
I '11 steer you to the promised land,
But swopping horses in the stream is bound to cause a slip."
If when you step inside the door,
They rave and hoot and hiss and roar,
And "Yar 1 " or "Boo," or "Guinea pig," they all distinctly
say;
Then gaze around with some surprise,
In martyred manner droop your eyes,
And say, "I hope, as Englishmen, you'll let me have fair
play."
If on a show of hands you find
They'll do without you (most unkind !)
And when they hear you '11 proxies use they shriek that it's a
sell;
Then say, "Although I much regret
The fact, I cannot leave you yet,
My duty's to record the votes of absentees as well."
If one should have the nerve to say
(You ne'er can tell, perhaps he may),
Because you sit on twenty boards he won't have your advice;
Then shrug your shoulders just a bit,
And give him back this gentle hit,
"That means that my experience is cheap at any price."
But if at last'_things clearly show,
That really you will have to go,
There's just one final sentiment they'll heartily applaud:
You give your voice a clarion ring,
And say, " In spite of everything,
You're welcome to my services'although I've left the board."
THE TALE OF A TYPEWRITER.
It was a phantom of delight
When first it gleamed upon my sight;
A lovely apparition sent
To be my study's ornament.
The key-board twinkled bright and new,
The plated levers twinkled too,
And underneath the case was seen
The very pulse of the machine,
That seemed to beckon and invite
To sit, to meditate, to write.
I sat for a while
With a big broad smile,
While the little bell rang in encouraging style;
And I tapped on the keys
As fast as you please,
Like a woodpecker busily tapping the trees.
I watched with delight on the paper appear
The letters so legible, round and clear,
And curly and curlier grew my lip
As I gazed on my masterly workmanship.
But who can tell
When all is well?
What I thought was a psean performed by the bell
Was really a knell
My hopes to dispel
And change my bright heaven to desolate hell.
When my gaze on the paper more narrowly fell
I found the whole business a fraud and a sell—
For the typer had never been taught to spell 1
The howlers it made!
I am fairly afraid
To tell all tho tricks that typewriter played I
You couldn't believe them although you essayed;
And take this from me—
No infant of three,
However much "mixed " the said infant might be,
Would dream of misspelling the words—simple, quite—
That that fool of a typewriter couldn't write right.
Then the stops: it was weird
To see what appeared I
Where a meek little comma the sense might have cleared,
A tall exclamation defiantly reared,
Or high in the air a small asterisk peered;
While as for its grammar, a fool had detected
Its whole education'd been grossly neglected.
Envoy.
For sale, a typewriter that's hardly been used.
A bargain. No offer in reason refused.
A WORD TO THE WISE.
At a famous murder trial in the middle of the last century, a
witness testified that the accused (who was subsequently
hanged) was locally regarded as a respectable man. Pressed for
the grounds for such a reputation the witness replied, "Ho drove
agig." The DailyTelegraph beats that classic distinction, which
nearly drove Carlyle mad. Reporting the circumstances
attending the attempted murder and suicide at Blackfriars, it
gravely says :—
"Bunting, who ia some years younger than his brother, wore a silk hat, and it
was no doubt due to this appearance of superior position as much as to
astonishment at the unusual incident that spectators who witnessed the
pursuit along the subway refrained from interfering."
Much is said, especially in hot weather, despitefully of the
top hat. Those about to commit murder in a public place will
note its remarkable influence at a critical moment.

A SAIL AND A "SELL."
Bluffer, to whom, in a weak moment,
I entrusted my fortunes last Saturday, in
a small sailing boat, deserves to be shown
up for the misery he inflicted upon an
individual who has never done him
any injury. (As yet—but I am waiting for
Bluffer still!) Overnight Bluffer had
looked me up at my hotel, and after a
cigar, he suggested that I should sail
round to Puddlecombe with him in his
flve-tonner, in the morning.
"Start 9.30—have a good sail—be there
at twelve. Come ashore and lunch with
me at the Yacht Club, and you shall be
back here before five. What say you?"
Thus Bluffer. And foolishly ignoring the
sapient sentence beginning "If sinners
entice thee "—and Bluffer is an awful
sinner, and no mistake !— I foolishly
consented.
Next morning, at 0.15, Bluffer's one
"hand"—he facetiously calls him his
crew—came up to my hotel with a message
to the effect that we must start in five
minutes. I bolted about half my break-
fast, scalded my tongue with hot tea,
forgot my pipe, and hurried off to the
jetty without a mackintosh. Here, "the
crew" invited me to enter a very cranky-
looking, small, "collapsible" dinghy, to
be rowed on board.
Entered dinghy gingerly. "Afraid you
must sit in bottom of boat, Sir. She's a
bit crank, yer see, Sir, and sometimes she
tarn right over if you "Sat down
with great promptness, in three inches
of water. Trousers at once [thoroughly
wetted for rest of day. Caught in swell
of passing steamer and nearly capsized—
a truly thrilling moment. Reached sail-
ing boat at last, safe, but nervous.
Climbed on board shivering. Wet through
from waist downwards.
"This is jolly, isn't it?" says enthu-
siastic BLUFFER, as he dislocates my
wrist helping me over the side. "Just
stand by, old chap, and — ah, look out
for the boom!—that's it! Oh, sorry,
really," as ho jerks coil of rope on which
I stand from under me, nearly throwing
me overboard. "Now, just duck your
head—that's it—out of the way, quick!
I shall only want you to keep in a stoop-
ing position for less than a quarter of an
hour. Haul up your anchor, Will. Now
stand by. I say, old man, you don't mind
my telling you that you 're rather in the
way there, do you? Better go into the
cabin till we're sailing."
"Go into the what?" I ask dubiously.
"Oh, this is the cabin, is it? This—this
sort of shelf thing, eh? Lie on the shelf?
Oh, very well," and I crawled into a
place like a rabbit-hutch, only not quite
so big. Much tramping about, and then
we started, or tried to, but there was not
a breath of wind. "Sure to get a puff
presently," cries theevercheery Bluffer,
as he hauls at tangled mass of ropes, then
slips up and sits with fearful violence on
the floor—deck, I mean.
We at once commenced a stately retro-
gression, until our further career was
arrested by going stern foremost into a
yacht at anchor. I draw a veil over the
scene that ensued, and forbear to repeat
the awful language which hurtled through
the air from boat to boat. We got clear,
and then came a thunder-clap, followed
immediately by a drenching downpour
of rain, and once more I took refuge in
the rabbit hutch. After an hour of this,
a slight breeze sprang up, and we drew
away from the other boat, forging ahead
for nearly a hundred yards. "Looks
pretty bad to windward," says Bluffer.
It did—black as ink. More thunder—
vivid lightning—dead calm. Will takes
dinghy and begins to tow us, in order to
avoid going on rocks. Three hours slowly
—oh, so slowly !—pass. Nothing to eat,
drink or smoke.
Bluffer still optimistic. I depressed.
Am wet through, hungry and thirsty.
Once more light breeze springs up. We
hope again. In vain, for it drops almost
immediately, and we drift slowly and sadly
on with the tide.
"We shall be up to the Club house in
another four hours," says B.
But by this time I am on the verge of
tears.
"Couldn't you put me ashore in the
dinghy?" I ask feebly. »
"Well, yes, I could, if you're not
enjoying it," he replies, in rather an
offended tone.
"Enjoying it?" I cover my faco with
my hands and repress a groan. Never
felt so happy in my life as when, once
more, I take my seat in dinghy—this time
six inches deep in water—and Will
paddles me a mile and a half to the shore.
Drop Will a shilling and rush off to
Station at Puddlecombe.
"Train for Swanbourne, Sir?" says
sympathetic porter. "Train's jest gone—
two hours and a 'arf to wait, Sir. Like to
set in the waitin' room, Sir? Refresh-
ment room, Sir? Well, no, there ain't
no refreshments, not rightly speakin',
Sir; but there's a bottle o' water and a
glass in the waitin' room, Sir."

smoothed over recent hubbub.

that jeer at newspapers. But remarks
about astronomy really admirable. Never
thought he could have such an inspiration.
Just the thing for me. Begin to find golf

Await news of your work with eagerness.
Telegram from Beaulieu.—Just my view.
Knew you would be interested. Have
bought small telescope. Unfortunately,
have no books on astronomy. Only
Whitaker. Can't understand his long
words. What does "planet in opposi-
tion " mean? Sounds like Harcourt.
Letter from Whittingliame.—I am getting
on splendidly. No time to write much. I
have got Astronomy for Beginners from
Edinburgh, and will try to help you. I
cannot find " Plantagenet in opposition"
in it. Have mislaid your telegram, but
remember you mentioned Harcourt. I
am just reading about the Nebular Hypo-

have none." I knew he would make a
mistake. Knows nothing about astronomy.
Advise you to look at Great Bear. It's
in the North. Most interesting.
Letter from Beaulieu.—I sat up again
all night looking through telescope for
Great Bear, but I couldn't see anything
with the faintest resemblance to a bear.
I really begin to doubt if astronomy is
such a rest after all. 1 get no sleep
whatever now, except in the day-time.
But I couldn't rest till I found it, so
I went over to Nice and called on the
Preset. Always thought him a charming
fellow. I said, "Avez-vous appris astro-
nomie?' Avez-vous vu le Grand Ours?"
"Pardon," said ho. "Le Grand Ours,"
said I, "dans le nurd?" "Ah, monsieur
le marquis," said he, "quelle charmante
plaisanterie! Vous parlez du Tsar. Non,
je ne I'ai pas vu." It is so annoying;
people always will talk politics, the very
thing I want to avoid. So I came back
here, and read all I could find in Whitaker.
Didn't you make a mistake in spelling
"Nebula"? There is no R at the end.
Anyway, I found the words "Nebula in
Orion." But that didn't ,help much, for
I don't know where Orion is. If I could
only find Orion, perhaps Hypothesis might
be near it. Just at that moment the
Prefet came to return my call. Rather
a nuisance. So I asked him, "Oh est
Orion?" Perhaps I didn't pronounce it
quite rightly. "Ah," he answered with
a laugh, "toujours des plaisanteries! Oh
est I'Orient? La Question d'Orient. Tr'es-
bien!" He always drags in politics. I
shall drop his acquaintance. As for that
Hypothesis Nebula, we shall really have
to call a Cabinet Council if we can't find
it. Never do to ask Astronomer Royal.
You were quite right. By the way,
Devonshire is President of the Board of
Education, so he ought to know a little
something about elementary knowledge.
Telegraph to him, probably asleep at
Newmarket.
Post-card from Whittinghame. — Good
idea. I also wanted to know where
Perseus is. So I telegraphed to Devon-
shire, " Where are Orion and Perseus?"
He replied, "Never heard of either. Are
you thinking of Ormonde and Persimmon?"
I cannot understand this at all. Have
searched all through my Astronomy for
Beginners, and cannot find either of these
stars. Devonshire must have been dream-
ing as usual.
Telegram from Beaulicu.—Never mind
anything. Finding night work awfully
tiring, tried day studies. Have made
grand discovery. Immense spot on sun.
Estimate its diameter about five hun-
dred thousand miles. Am writing full
description of it. Get no sleep now day
or night.
Telegram from Whittinghame.—Heartiest
congratulations. Shall I inform Astrono-
mer Royal?
Telegram from Beaulieu. — Immediate.
Very important. For goodness'sake, don't.
All a mistake. Spot of ink on end glass
of telescope. Utterly disgusted. Shall
give up astronomy. Politics less agitating.
So am coming home. H. D. B.

HARRY'S SON'S HOLIDAY REMINISCENCES. No. 3.-SWITZERLAND.
(Lhrorn all by himself, and signed "Harry's Son.")
ENTERPRISING PRO-MOTOR.
Onr of our special correspondents
started out to try the effect of taking
notes from his motor car whilst proceed-
ing at top speed. The experiment took
place in June; but wo have only just re-
ceived the following account of the result.
"Started away and turned on full bead
of smell—steam, I mean. Over South-
wark Bridge, fizz, kick, bang, rattle!
Flew along Old Kent Road; knocked
down two policemen on patrol duty
(" Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road ");
fizzed on through New Cross and
Lewisham at awful, nerve - destroying,
sobbing pace, "toot toot-ing" horn
all the way. No good, apparently, to
some people, who would not, or possibly
could not, get out of the way. Cannoned
milk-cart entering Eltham village, ran into
bus, but shot off it again, at a tangent, up
on to the footpath, frightening old lady
into hysterics. Onwards wo went, leap-
ing and flying past everything on the
road, into open country. Ran over dog
and three chickens, and saw tandem
horses take fright and bolt; dust flew,
people yelled at us and we yelled at
people. Came round sharp corner on to
donkey standing in road. "Boosted" him
up into the air and saw him fall through
roof of outhouse! Whirr-r-up! bang!
rattle ! flzz-izz—Bust!
"Where am I?—Oh, in hospital — oh,
really?—Seems nice clean sort of place.—
How long ?Oh, been here about six
weeks—have I, really? And what——?
Oh, (>ot/i arms, you say ?—and left leg?
Ah—by the way, do you know anyone
who wants to buy a motor ?What, no
motor left ?—By Jove! that's funny, isn't
it?—Well, I think 1 '11 go to sleep again
now."

"Pacfcet of Cheap Cigarettes." Apaper-
and-hay currency which circulated among
the male infant population of Great Britain
at tho close of the "Victorian era, paving
the way to decimal coinage. Each packet
contained ten " fags," or cigarettes, and,
with portrait of popular general or actress
thrown in, was exchanged at par for two
cents, or one penny. The portraits were
redeemable from the purchaser in various
advantageous ways, if a set could be
obtained; hence a fine spirit of hero and
stage-worship was bred among the juve-
nile speculators, who would waylay the
most unlikely persons with requests for
"fag-photos" instead of coppers. In-
cidentally, these patriotic efforts at last
impaired tho nerves and reduced the
stature of the rising (sic) generation to
such an extent that the currency in
question had be abolished. It was then
discovered by bimetallists what had been
through many years the disturbing factor
in the rates of exchange.
"South African Loyalist Family
(Skeletons)." These specimens, in their
living form, belonged to a branch of sub-
tropical fauna which atone time (previous
to 1900) were widely spread over Cape
Colony and tho adjoining parts. Owing,
however, to a systematic policy of dis-
couragement pursued by the Imperial
Government then in office (the same
authorities who "preferred unmounted
men" for mobile columns), it was gradually
brought homo to the individuals in
question that "loyalty did not pay,"
especially when they saw that all the
available fat of the land was reserved
ipso facto for the more dangerous crea-
tures who displayed enough "slimness"
(Anglice", treachery) and truculency to
warrant an outcry in their favour on tho
part of the home sentimentalists. The
breed of loyalists, therefore, became
extinct, at least in this part of Africa,
but the collector may still occasionally
meet with whole groups of skeletons in
the remoter districts of the veld.

HYDE PARK AND THE FAIRY.
III.—Thk Story of the One-eyed Duck.
"Stand in a fairy ring and wish to hear
the Story of the One-eyed Duck." That had
been the advice of my little elf friend.
Or had I imagined the whole thing—just
an Autumn day-dream ?" The fact is, old
chap," I said, addressing myself severely,
"you shouldn't take stout in the middle
of the day. If you do you will feel sleepy,
and, feeling sleepy, by a natural transition
you will sleep in the Park, and then
perchance to dream!"
Talking ducks—a fairy ring! I was
growing quite scornful. The idea was so
absurd; and to show how absurd it was I
would look out for a ring and fulfil the
imaginary instructions. Therefore I left
the Serpentine and made for the grass.
"Dropped anything, Sir?" remarked an
affable policeman, as I was bending
intently over a faintly defined circle.
"No, thanks—only looking out for a
fairy ring."
The policeman favoured me with a pro-
longed stare, then moved off, to meditate,
doubtless, upon what kind of jewellery a
fairy ring might be.
"Please, wot's the toime?" screeched
a small boy.
"Wish to hoar the Story of the One-
eyed Duck," I muttered to myself.
"Can't 'ear yer," said the urchin.
"Three o'clock, three o'clock !" I siid
rather irritably ; then walked away feeling
ashamed of my performance. "But, at
any rate," I argued, "you've shown the
futility of the wish, and corroborated the
'stout' theory."
By this time I had reached the Serpen-
tine again, and was watching a white
mist curl round the boat-house, when—
A queer, hoarse, croaky voice near by
,remarked suddenly, "The worst worm I'd
tasted for a long time." I stared round,
but there was no one near at hand to
whom I could attach this astonishing
gastronomic criticism. Then I looked
down. Two ducks were standing gloomily
at the water's edge. The reflections of
one were suddenly dissipated by a piece
of floating bread. Her friend gave an
indignant quack, not having observed
the morsel herself. Then I noticed she
was blind of one eye.
"Heartfelt apologies, kind Fairy," I
ejaculated, and sat down straightway on
a seat close by to listen. The duck paid
no attention to me; but I could under-
stand perfectly what she said, as she
quacked out to her companion a recent
adventure in Hyde Park iii which she
had played a part, which certainly threw
a new light upon London Life.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. IV.—Herbert Wellesley Rossiter
(Continued.)
Men who make Empire should not speak: the rule
Bears no exception at the present day.
Those massive thoughts which, if transformed to deeds,
Flutter the dovecotes of diplomacy,
Make nations tremble, and can carve their way
To fame and fortune on a stricken field—
These thoughts, so great, so true, so numerous,
Brook not the trammels of our native tongue.
A man may think, "I '11 plant the Union Jack
Triumphant on the ramparts of the foe;
Civilisation shall attend my steps;
Progress shall be my handmaid; I will bring
Plenty and peace where chaos was before."
All this a man may think, but if he strives
To utter what he thinks it's ten to one
(It may be more, 1 am not skilled in odds)
His tongue will trip him and his words will prove
Traitors, and wheresoever gapes a hole,
Seen by all men, avoidable and large,
Into its depths his woful foot must plunge,
Though all the world should warn and call him back.
Of these was Rossiter, the man of cheques.
I saw him standing on the platform, flanked
By listening peers: a Duke was on his right;
Upon his left a monied Marquis shone;
Two Earls, three Viscounts gilded the array,
Barons and younger scions, Hons., were there,
Strewed o'er the platform thick as autumn leaves.
Rulers of Banks and princes of finance,
Men at whose nod the giddy millions flew,
Were ranged about him, and the hall was packed
Prom door to dais, seats and gangways, too,
Were crammed with sympathetic City men.
And in his front, before a table, sat
The keen reporters in a serried row,
Their ears intent to hear his eloquence,
Their pencils sharpened swift to write it down.
They did not seem unkind ; their look was bland,
Much like the look of ordinary men.
Their homes in Camberwell or Islington,
Clapham or Balham, Battersea or Bow,
Were cheerful homes; they lived industrious lives,
Respected by their neighbours, went to church,
And paid their rent, and brought their children up,
And gave their wives the wherewithal to keep
Wolves from the door and victuals on*the board.
Who could have thought they were so terrible
That Rossiter should fear them? Yet they turned
His blood to water as they sat and wrote
There in their devilish shorthand what he spoke.
Words, words! Where were they? All the careful words
That he had trimmed and polished for his use?
Forgotten like a dream, and in their stead
Danced in his brain a troop of flighty words,
Wrong, but alluring, words that beckoned him,
Saying, " Come, use me ; I am what you seek."
And this, or something like it, was his speech:—
"Ahem—I never thought—at least, I did^-
But there, you know me—you have heard my name—
Ahem "—(o voice, " Speak up! ")—" It's jolly fine
To say, ' speak up,' but let the gentleman,
That is, if truly he's a gentleman,
Which"—{interruption, mingled with applause)—
"Well, if he wants to speak himself he can,
Not now, but later "—(voices: "Wliat about
The Blacklock Syndicate ? ")—" The Syndicate
Was never better: ten per cent, it paid
Last year—but, let me see, I meant to say
Something—what was it ?—ah, I recollect,
Something about our mines in Turkestan."
(Wild cheers, the audience shouting as one man.)
"They 're pretty good—eh 1 what ?—there's nothing much
The matter with the mines." (Applause.) "I say
Those who foretold their ruin are but curs,
Mean, whisky-soaking curs. I never mince
My words." (" You don't.") "I know what's what"—
(" roil do")—
"And mean to have it all the time." (" Bravo I ")
"I don't think much of statesmen." (" Nor do we.")
"They seem to wish to stamp our commerce out
With silly theories of right and wrong.
There's not a patriot amongst them all.
I'm for the Union Jack "—(" You are! you are 1 ")—
"The good old interest-bearing Union Jack,
The flag of freedom and the badge of trade."
(Immense applause, the audience rising up
And singing "Rule Britannia.") "I'm the man
To show—ahem—(he dranfc some water here)—
What was I saying ?—ah—I beg to move
That we adopt the Board's report, and pass
The balance-sheet which is attached thereto."
With this he ended, and sat down and wiped
His humid brow, and all the gathering
Broke in a storm of loud applause, and men
Yelled their approval, and the meeting seemed
One mad confusion of concordant cheers.
And the stout Duke who sat by Rossiter
Whispered, " Well done "; the Marquis and the Earls
And all the Barons on the platform, too,
Beamed their delight:—" You didn't tell them much,"
Opined the Duke, " but what you said was more,
Far more, than ample to confirm their faith."
And I too went direct and bought a bull
Of the Consolidated Turkestans,
Thus proving that though eloquence is much,
Money is more and Rossiter is great. R. C. L.
(To be continued.)
APOSTROPHES!
No. I.—To My Umbrella.
Hail! magic membrane spread o'er ribs of steel,
Thy " points " are many, and with mute appeal
They rouse the tend'rest feelings in my breast;
To thee I turn, and turning I am blest.
Whence is this ecstasy of pure delight?
Why do I hail thee morning, noon and night?
It is not merely that for many a month
The gingham thief, who feareth not nor shunn'th
To rob his neighbour, hath respected me,
And, pilfering others, hath not pilfered thee.
It is not that, alike in rain or shine,
Thou hast stood steadfastly a friend of mine,
Casting thy segis o'er my cowering form,
And shielding nobly from the biting storm.
No ! but that once, what time the clouds had power
To pelt the pavement with a passing shower,
As in a dream, I sheltered Arabella
Beneath thy glorious ribs, O grand umbrella!
'Twas then, 'twas then, one simple word she said
That would have roused me dying! Ah, sweet maid!
It needeth no philosopher to guess
That that same "simplo word " was simply " yes."
And thou art evermore a thing apart—
A fairy form enshrined within my heart.

ODE TO A HUMORIST.
See -where the Humorist lots fly
His shafts of ready wit;
Hear how his observations dry
Make all with laughter split.
The loud guffaw his mirth provokes,
You wonder where he gets his jokes,
You marvel at his sportive vein;
While treasuring up his smartest jest
(As yours) you let it off with zest
Next morning in the train.
Where'er a sense of humour lurks -
He, hopeful to beguile,
Is heard, extorting by his quirks
A tributary smile.
The measured grin, the chuckle e'en,
Assures him that the point is seen.
With what applause you feed his fun
As off the jest is lightly tost,
And roar insanely at the most
Excruciating pun.
To millions Life is little more
Than three good meals a day,
To him who asks you when a door
Is not a door, a play
On words. His livelihood depends
On his good humour. Him his friends
View as a man at whom to laugh.
A joke existence is to him,
A ribald jest, a sport, a whim,
A granary for " chaff."
Vain jest preserver, ponder well
Thy period ultimate,
When groans instead of giggles tell
How serious is thy state!
When fancy flags, when thou hast run
Thy space of superficial fun.
Thou poor, misguided Humorist!
When thou art humorously " broke,"
When thou bast got " beyond a joke,"
No laughing matter is't.
PROHIBITIONS TO NOVELISTS AND
JOURNALISTS.
Never—(1) Talk of plovers' eggs at a
sumptuous feast or county ball during the
winter months;
(2) Allude to the Kino as "He who was
born Prince of Wales," because, as a
matter of fact, His Majesty was not;
(3) Make mention of the Lord and Lady
Mayoress of London. There is no Lord
Mayoress of London, nor yet of Man-
chester, Birmingham, or Dublin;
(4) Talk of the New Cut. In aristocratic
circles it is known as Lower Marsh;
(5) Describe a " ride" in a carriage or
other vehicle. Some persons ride on horses,
camels, elephants and donkeys. The illite-
rate rido on omnibuses, motor-cars,
"trams," and costermongers' barrows;
(fl) Rhapsodise on "cherry lips." No-
body's lips could possibly resemble
cherries. It is only just, however, to
state that gooseberry eyes and banana
noses are fair comparisons;
(7) Discourse on "limpid water."
"Limpid " • means- bright, 'and is the

Sentry (on the sim ultaneous approach of two persons).
WAYS AT ONCE!"
'Who goes there ?—two
current term of advertising-mongers of
filters. Otherwise it has no signification
whatever;
(8) Say, in criticising a play, "The pit
rose." The pit never rises, but sometimes
it is content with standing room only;
(9) Allude to the "waning moon." No
moon ever wanes. It merely waita for a
turn of the earth;
(10) Be enthusiastic about the surge of
the sea. The best sea serge is converted
into yachting suits;
(11) Lightly refer to a coffin as a
sarcophagus. A sarcophagus is not easily
transferred by hearse labour;
(12) Say the audience rose as one man
when many members of the fairer and
stronger sex were present.
NON EBUR NEQUE AUREUM.
No marble porticos adorn
My unpretentious dwelling.
On costly columns high upborne—
My neighbour's house I do not scorn
With pride unduly swelling.
I own no princely pedigrees,
No income worth the mention,
No host of clients' golden fees
Bring to support me at my ease,
I draw no ample pension.
Yet humble though my house appear,
The rich desire to get it;
Since the Procession passes near,
A fortune I may make next year—
If I can only let it.
During an Interview. — A leading
actress, who is notably well " billed " all
over town and country, observed to tho
interviewer: "Of course I can't got on
without 'billing,' and," she added slyly,
"a little 'cooing.' Do I use powder?
Why, of course. What do you think?
And, my dear Sir, I shall now depend on
you—for the powder?—oh dear no—for
the puff!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 30, 1901.
THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A Great Thought for Every Day in the Year.
Second Series.
X.—THE HENRY JAMES SECTION.
OCTOBER 1st.—It superficially might havo seemed that to
answer. Lady Ciieveley's invitation to her daughter's -wedding
was a matter that would put no intolerable strain upon the
faculties of discriminative volition. Yet the accident of foreign
travel had brought about that this formal invitation, found on
my return, constituted my first advertisement of even so
much as "Vivien Cheveley's engagement to M. le Conte
RICHARD Sansjambes. The original question, simplified as it
was by public knowledge of the fact that I regard all cere-
monial functions with a polite abhorrence, had, accordingly,
taken on a new complexity, involving considerations of a high
sociologic interest; as, notably, whether, and, if at all, in
what form, I should offer the lady my felicitations.
2nd, 3rd.—My obsession by these problems over a space of
four-and-twenty hours was only partially relieved by contact
with the divertissements of Piccadilly as I drove to the
Prytaneum Club. To my hansom's temporary arrest, however,
attributable to the stream of vehicles converging in a trans-
verse sense .at the corner of St. James's Street, I owed an
interval of recrudescent deliberation. During that so tense
period I conscientiously—such is the force of confirmed habit—
reviewed all the permissible methods—and scarce fewer than a
round dozen of variants lay at that moment in my right breast-
pocket—of addressing a woman-friend on the occasion of her
betrothal. Always the equivocal detachment of an unrejected
bachelor had for me the air of imparting to these crises, poig-
nant enough in themselves, a touch of invidious dilemma. The
delicate question why the felicitator himself—to hypothecate
his eligibility—had not been a candidate for the lady's heart, a
qnestion answerable, on the lips of her friends, by a theory of
self-depreciation, and, on those of her enemies, by one of
indifference, remained—unless he chose, as one says, to "give
himself away "—incapable of adequate solution.
4th.—For myself, it is true, by way of a passable solace in
this cornucopious predicament, there was my known prejudice,
amounting almost, I am told, to a confessed morbidity, in favour
of the celibate state. It was still, however, nevertheless, open
to the contention of malice that I conceivably might have—
whereas, in fact, ! had not—submitted to the lady's charms,
had they—as they apparently had not—been of a sufficiently
overwhelming nature. But this, relatively, was, after all, a
trivial embarrassment, mastered, qn more occasions, already,
than one, by a delicate subtlety of diction, in which I permit
myself to take a pardonable pride.
Bth.—" My dear Miss Vivien, '' I, recalling the terms of a parallel
correspondence, had written, "what brings to you, for whom I
entertain a so profound regard, brings, to me also, an exquisite
joy." And, again, alternatively, and in a phraseology more
instinct with poetry and pith—" I, in your gladness, am myself
glad." And, once more, with, I confess, a greater aloofness,
yet, at the game time, positing, by implication, a plurality of
suitors to select from :—" Quite indubitably enviable is the
man on whom your choice has fallen."
6th, 7th.—But what complicated the situation and left me
hesitant between these and, roughly, some nine other open-
ings, was the reflection that, in point of fact, I had never
set eyes on the Count, nor yet even heard—and with this my
long absence from England must be charged—the lightest tale
of him. Mightn't it be, after all, a marriage, purely, I asked
myself, of convenience ?—wealth, possibly, a title, certainly,
exchanged for the asset of youthful bloom? Mightn't it be—
and there was recorded precedent for this—that the man,
being French, as one gathered, and calling himself by a foreign
title—a pretension, commonly, that invited scepticism—had
exerted over her some Magic, or even, taking into account
both his foreignness and his Counthood, as much as Two
Magics? Or, again, most deplorable of all, mightn't he have
acquired a hold upon her by secret knowledge of some skeleton,
as the phrase is, in her private cupboard; an intrigue, let us
daringly say, with a former butler, banished for that de-
linquency and harbouring vengeance against her house by the
revelation of her complicity?
8th.—But here I subconsciously reminded myself that the
nicest adepts in abstract psychology may, if they do but
sufficiently long address themselves to problems abnormally
occult, become the prey of a diseased imagination. And by
great good luck the forward movement of my hansom, now
disembroiled from the traffic, which had thrown off something
of its congestion, caused a current of air which allowed me,
the glass being up, a saner purview of the question. "When I
reach the Prytaneum, I'll," I said, "look the gentleman up in
the Almanack de Botha." This, in fact, had been among the
motives, had been, I might even say, the dominating motive, of
my visit to the Club.
9TH, 10th.—That atmosphere of considered serenity which
meets one at the very portals of the Prytaneum, and is of an
efficacy so paramount for the allaying of neurotic disorders, had
already relieved the tension of my introspective mood by the
time that I had entered the fuvioir and rung for cigarettes and
mineral water. The greeting, familiarly curt, that reached me
from an armchair near the fire, was traceable, it appeared, to
Guy Mallaby. Here, I was glad to think, I had found a living
supplement to the Almanach, for I remembered him to have been
a friend, some had even said a blighted admirer, of Vivien
Cheveley. He had married, whether for consolation or from
pique, his cook; and I now noticed, in a glance that embraced
him cursorily, that his girth had, since his marriage, increased
by some four to six inches.
llTH.—It could scarce be more than a rude estimate, viewing
the fact that I had no tape-measure about me, an adjunct
that I from time to time have found serviceable in cases that
apparently, called for mere psychologic diagnosis; nor, had I
so had, am I convinced that I should, in this instance, have
allowed myself the application of it. Simply I moved to-
wards him, and, at the same time, yielding to the usage which
a twelve-months absence requires, held out my hand. He took
it with, as I thought, a certain surprise, quickly dissembled, but
not, as I repeat, before I'd mentally remarked it.
12th, 13th.—At any other juncture I should have been closely
tempted to pursue the train of inference suggested by this
phenomenon; but just then, for the moment, I was preoccupied.
Besides, anyhow, his initial observation proved his astonish-
ment to be derived from a quite transparent, if not altogether
venial, cause. "Been out of town," he asked, " for Christmas?"
I confess that, though I had the good breeding not to betray it,
this speech, the tone of which, under ordinary conditions,
would not have affected me to the point of regarding it as a
truancy beyond the prescribed bounds of gentlemanly casual,
ness, caused me, having regard to the circumstance of my long .
absence, a calculable pain in my amour propre. Never so
vividly had not merely the complexity, almost cosmic, of life in
the Metropolis, its multiform interests and issues so exigently
absorbing, but also the inconspicuousness of the vacuum
created by the withdrawal of any single—in this case my
own—personality, been forced upon my attention.
14th, 15th.—Here, again, at any other time, I should have
found abundant matter for analysis; but the entrance of the
waiter with my cigarettes and mineral water, one of the former
of which I deliberately lighted, recalled me from this inviting
diversion. By a natural process of reaction I become cognisant
of the necessity, every moment more pressing, of composing
an answer to Mallaby's question.
Scarce anything could have been easier than so to impregnate

my reply with the truth, whole and
unadulterated, as to compel, on his side,
an embarrassment -which I, for one, should
have viewed, in the retrospect, as regret-
table. Yet, for a full three quarters of a
minute, towards the latter half of which
period it was evident that Mai.LABy con-
ceived my memory to have strangely lapsed,
the temptation possessed mo to follow the
course I have just indicated. But, in
the issue—whether more from a desire to
spare his feelings, or, at least as much,
because the practice of finesse, even in
conjunctions of negligible import, has had
for mo always a conquering fascination,
I cannot determine—I, with a terseness
sufficiently antiphonal to his own,
replied :—" Yes. Monte Carlo."
16th.—Then, from an apprehension that
he might follow up his enquiries—for my
travels had, in actual fact, been confined
to Central Asia and the transit there and
in an opposite sense—or invite a reciprocal
curiosity, on my part, in regard to hh
Christmas, "By the way," I, as if by a
natural continuity of thought, added,
"who is this Count Richard Sansjambes
that is to marry Miss Cueveley?" At
the same time, not to appear too intrigued
by the matter in question, I withdrew my
cigarette from my mouth, flicked it lightly
in air, and then abstractedly replaced it,
less the ash. O. S.

THE MERRY MOTORIST'S LAMENT.
If you desire to travel fast,
A motor car is unsurpassed;
Should you desire to travel far,
Trust not too much a motor car.
And if you 're bold enough to start,
Take duplicates of every part:
Two sparking plugs, and tremblers twain,
But, chief, a double dose of brain.
For foes are many ; and, of course,
The worst of all's the brainless horse,
Who fain would crush in malice blind
This coming saviour of his kind.
And rules long made by custom's code
For safer usage of the road
Are broken with sublime disdain
By muffs or masters of the rein.
And children, always out of school,
Make it their one unfailing rule
To dart from wheresoe 'er they are
To prance before a motor car.
For this remember : in a town
The street's the only playground known,
Where gambol, deaf to every noise,
The town's whole strength of girls and
boys.
And on each adult face is written
The protest of the outraged Briton
When, deeply shocked, he fails to find
Oaths strong enough to ease his mind.
See ambushed flocks of hostile sheep
From every hedge prepared to leap:
See every cow regard askance
This last monstrosity from France!
See goats, ablaze with moral scorn,
Rush butting with too bold a horn:
See dogs, despairful of the age,
Seized with a suicidal rage I
Ware, too, the Peeler: see him stand
Sneaking at milestones, watch in hand,
To swear your pace exceeded far
The pace that's lawful for a car;
That when before the Bench you come
The Court may do a simple sum
To prove S, mile in minutes three
More than twelve miles an hour must be!
Drivers may leave their horses' heads,
Or sleep in carts instead of beds,
Butchers may gallop through a town:
But not on these will Justice frown.
No! only motorists inspire
Justice with undiluted ire:
For them alone she weights the
scales,
For them alone no plea avails.
These are the perils, these the woes,
Only the motor-driver knows:
For whom is writ, in earth and air,
One single word, the word Beware I
"Withdraw! Withdraw !"—" It has
so often been in withdrawals," said the
Times of October 23, "that ho (Sir
Redvers Buller) has prided himself,
when perhaps other men would not have
withdrawn." Yes, quite true; and now
Sir Redvers has, on compulsion, with-
drawn himself altogether, without having
withdrawn anything that he said at the
unfortunate banquet on October 10.

THE PLAYS OF SHAWKSPEAB.E.
NO. II.—CORIOLANUS.
An Election Tragedy.
ACT I.—Scene—A street in Rome. The
stage is filled with the usual crowd of
idlers which never fails to assemble in
any city when a victorious army is
returning home from war. The crowd
on this occasion is more than usually
enthusiastic, since Coriolanus is one of
the generals in command of the return-
ing troops, and the accounts of his
taking of Corioli in the war against the
Volscians have fired the popular
imagination.
On tlie outskirts of the crowd stand
Sicinius and BRUTUS, Tribunes of the
People and prominent members of the
Liberal Opposition. Brutus is a fat,
rubicund man with a twinkling eye.
SIC1NIUS is lean (Did saturnine. They
note tlie demeanour of the people
critically, considering its bearingsupon
the fortunes of the political party to
which they both belong.
Brutus (turning to his companion with
an amused smile). Humph! Looks bad for
us, eh?
Sicinius (with a scowl). Bah 1 The war
fever. It won't last.
Bru. It '11 last long enough to make him
Consul.
Sic. Coriolanus?
Bru. Yes. They '11 elect him to a
certainty.
Sic. (savagely). Not if I can prevent it.
Bru. (shrugging his shoulders). The Khaki
vote, my dear fellow.
[The sound of a military band is heard
in the distance playing a popular
Jingo march.
Sic. (irritably). That infernal tune too!
Bru. The mob like it. We 're not a
musical nation. Here they come. Stand
aside and watch the people cheer their
favourite.
[Sicinius and Brutus stand aside. The
music grows louder and the pro-
cession begins to cross the stage
with drums banging, colours flying
and all the pomp of a military
spectacle. The people cheer from
time to time as some incompetent
but popular officer rides by.
Brutus uxifches the whole proces-
sion with the utmost good humour.
Sicinius turns impatiently away.
Sic. How long are they going to keep up
this howling?
Bru. (laughing). They've hardly begun
yet. Wait till Coriolanus appears, and
you'll see what cheering is. (A distant
roar of "Coriolanus!" "Coriolanus!"
is heard off.) I told you so.
[The roar of cheering comes nearer
until it rises to frantic enthusiasm
as a fat, bumptious, red-faced man
appears upon tlie stage L riding
in a chariot. He passes slowly
across the stage, and the ichirl-
wind of applause passes with him
and dies off gradually R.
Sic. All that fuss over a third-rate
General 1
Bru. If you talk like that, my dear
fellow, you '11 certainly be mobbed.
Sic. The fools can't hear anything except
their own shouting.
Bru. Aren't you rather hard on Corio-
lanus? He's not a genius, of course.
None of our generals are. But he's a
dashing officer.
Sic. Dashing.! He's the worst tactician
in the army. The Volscians laugh at him.
Bru. Well, you can't deny his courage.
He's been wounded thirty times.
Sic. Then he ought to be cashiered.
What business has a general to be
wounded? He ought to keep out of range
and direct operations.
Bru. (good /iiimoitred/i/). He took Corioli,
anyhow.
Sic. Yes. The Yolscians ran away, and
so Coriolanus is a hero—with a title
and the thanks of the Senate. The attack
ought to have failed by all the rules of
war. (BJictoricaliy.) And what a war!
A nation in arms against a handful of
farmers!
Bru. Hush, my dear fellow. You'll be
heard if you don't take care.
Sic. (losing all sense of prudence,
and almost screaming with Pro-Volscian
fervour). Heard I So much the better.
It is time that someone spoke out. I tell
you that Coriolanus'S generalship is per-
fectly contemptible, that his troops were
guilty of outrages against women and
children, and that ....
[An ominous murmur arises from the
crowd, whose attention has wan-
dered now tliat the last of the pro-
cession has passed. Hearing thevoice
of Sicinius raised in impassioned
oratory, it has gathered round
with tlie ready curiosity of crowds.
A Citizen. What's that he says about
Coriolanus?
Another Citizen. Slandering theGeneral,
is he? Knock his ugly head off.
[The crowd begins to hustle Sicinius.
BRUTUS tries to get him away.
Bru. Come away, my dear fellow.
They 're looking dangerous.
Sic. (furiously). I won't! I won't! (At
the top of his voice.) Citizens! Hear
what I have to say. (To Brutus again.)
Let me go, Brutus.
Bru. (shrugging his shoulders). Very
well. But don't expect me to back you
up. 1 've no ambition for martyrdom.
;[Disappears into the croxvd.
Sic. Citizens! I tell you this has been
an unjust war, a vile war. . . .
Crowd. Down with him! Down with
the traitor! He's a Pro-Volscian! &c,
&c.
[The crowd closes round Sicinius, look-
ing vicious. k
Sic. (snouting). Back, there! I am
Sicinius, Tribune of the People, and my
person is inviolable.
Crowd. We'11 see about that. Tribunes
be hanged! To the Tiber! Pro-Volscian!
[T)»ereis, however, a division of opinion
among the crowd. Hie soberer
portion feel obliged to defend the
inviolability of a tribune, while the
majority are bent on avenging
the honour of the army. In tlie
vielie which follows Sicinius is
more or less severely knocked about.
Just as things are getting serious,
tlie inevitable. Policeman saunters
up.
Policeman. Now then, what's the matter
there. Pass along! Pass along!
Crowd. He's a Pro-Volscian! Break
his neck! To the Tiber!
Pol. (shouldering his uxiy through the
crowd imperturbably, and wrenching
Sicinius, sadly mauled, out of the hands of
his tormentors). Hands off, there! You '11
kill the man!
Crowd (taking up the cry). Kill him!
Kill him!
[The crowd make another ugly rush in
the direction of the wretched
Tribune and his protector. The
Policeman blows his whistle. A
dozen constables run up from all
sides ; trunclieons are drawn; there
is a scrimmage, and the mob are
driven off. The Policeman props
Sicinius in a sitting posture against
a wall. Enter Brutus l. He
strolls up and contemplates his
friend dispassionately.
Bru. Close shave that, officer.
Pol. Yes, Sir. Friend of your's, Sir?
Bru. Yes. No bones broken, I suppose?
Pol. (feeling him over). Not this time,
Sir.
Bru. That's lucky. My friend was ex-
pressing some opinions which happen to
be not very popular with the people just
now.
Pol. (with a twinkle in his eye). So I
supposed, Sir.
Bru. It's just as well you turned up
when you did. (Giving him money.) You
can leave him to me now.
Pol. Very well, Sir. Thank you, Sir.
[Exit Policeman.
Bru. (to Sicinius). You look pretty bad.
Can you move, do you think?
Sic. (groaning). I feel as if there wasn't
a whole bone in my body.
Bru. Poor fellow. I told you What would
happen if you tried to hold a Stop-the-
War meeting here to-day.
Sic. (sulkily). Well, you soem safe
enough.
Bru. (cheer/ully). I should think so.
I'm not an absolute fool. If you'd seen
me shouting " Down with the Volscians!"
and " Coriolanus for ever 1 " ten minutes
ago you wouldn't have known me.
Sic. You did that?

Bru. Of course I did. You don't want
oil the Pro-Volscians in this city trampled
to death by the mob on the same day, do
you? If you and I had both been killed,
•who would have led the Party?
Sic. (faintly). That's true.
[Enter Menenius Agrippa, a popular
and amiable member of the Con-
servative Party.
Menenius. Hullo Brutus! Sicinius too?
Been making a speech to the League of
Romans against Aggression and Mili-
tarism? (Sicinius turns away his head
impatiently.) By the way, how is the
League? At the last meeting I heard that
the speakers had to retire by a back door

YOU in the future who will bear
Aloft trade banners and its pennants,

And add, your training to complete,
At least a smattering of science.
Only astronomy I bar,
The universe's contemplation,
Fly not in thought from star to star
(A useless occupation !)
Lest, blinded by the starry dust
That heaven's empyrean spangles,
You turn and eye with deep disgust
Earth's petty trade and party wrangles.

To making speeches after dinners,

Or owning Derby winners;

With seasonable erudition,
Will offer you, you '11 all admit,
An ample scope for your ambition.

"Biograph Record of Football Match."
We have here another interesting mediae-
val survival in this exhibit, which dates
from September, 1901. It throws a strong
light on the behaviour of professionals
and tho manners of the crowd at this
bygone period. The match in question
was between the Hit-and-Punch Hooligans
and the Win - Tie - or - Wranglers. There
are several exciting incidents to be
noted, as when the goal-keeper is neatly
"laid out" by four opponents, and the
Hooligans' half-back bites off a Wrangler's
nose—of course, only in play—and has his
head battered in by way of friendly ex-
change. Mark also the spirited conduct
of the bystanders in stoning a former idol
now playing against the home team, and
their prompt disapproval of the umpire's
verdict in giving a "foul." Towards
half-time he is being carried off the
ground unconscious, and with a broken
spine. No wonder such a stirring game
should have been so popular among the
more vigorous elements of the British
democracy. It was essentially a sport,
too, for lookers-on, and, as such, an
excellent substitute for a bull-light.

THE YOUNG NOVELISTS GUIDE TO
LAW.
Barrister. A favourite profession for
a hero. He should be pale, clean-shaven,
dark, and a cynical smile should play
faintly round his lips. When not engaged
in making brilliant and impassioned
speeches in Court, the barrister devotes
his time to giving tea-parties in his
chambers. Occa
sionally he is in- J
terrupted by;
c 1 i ents "—i.e.
by litigants. The
flctionary barrister
is always delighted
to see them, and
scorns to ask for
the mediation of a
mere solicitor.
Beautiful young
ladies in distress
eagerly seek his
advice. The villain
has secured the
services of at least
five King's Coun-
sel, but the hero-
barrister and the
young lady always
win their case.
Brief. A mys-
terious thing out
of which the bar-
rister makes his
fortune. In the
case of the barris-
ter-hero, the first
brief often is
brought to him by
his fiance'e, who
carries it about
with her in her
pocket. It is never
marked less than
one hundred
guineas, and two
chapters after re-
ceiving it the hero
takes silk.
Detective. A
profession which
once promised a
good opening, but
is now distinctly
overcrowded, especially since the firm
of Sherlock and Watson have turned
their business over to an unlimited
company. The detective force, for the
novelist's purposes, may be classed under
two heads: (1) the free-lance detective,
who is phenomenally astute, (2) the official
detective, who is incredibly idiotic.
When a specimen of the latter class has
found three false clnes, made four bad
blunders, and arrested half - a - dozen
entirely innocent and respectable people,
the free-lance detective may be brought
on the scene. He, of course, will un-
ravel the whole mystery in a couple of
pages.
Evidence. Talk about things in general,
and a convenient way of putting dull but
necessary explanations before the reader.
Having arranged for a trial of some sort
in your story, you subpoena all the
characters as witnesses. Perhaps you
will begin with the bluff old Squire, and
follow him with the comic rustic witness

How Sik Jonathan D'Outke-Mer desired the sole control of the Lady Nicotine,
and challenged Sir John de Bull to do battle for this cause.
—always very popular. After this, amid
a low murmur of repressed excitement,
the fair young heroine will step into the
box. "Madam," the Judge will say,
"will you be so good as to favour us with
your opinion in regard to this case?"
And then in a voice low but clearly audible
in every corner of the court, the heroine
will talk for the rest of the chapter.
Judge. Usually a benevolent old gentle-
man who has gold-rimmed glasses and a
heart several sizes too large for his pro-
fession. Is always glad to talk over in
his own house a case which he will have
to try next day, especially with one of
the parties to the suit. So anxious to
save trouble, that frequently he will
undertake the duties of counsel for the
plaintiff or defendant (according to the
side the heroine is on) as well as his own.
At the end of the book he will take off and
wipe his gold-rimmed glasses, and address
a few words of paternal advice to the
bride and bridegroom.
Solicitor. Oc-
casionally a bland
and amiable gen-
tleman, but more
often a villain of
the deepest dye.
Trespass. A
dreadful crime, for
which (in novels)
people can be pro-
secuted and com-
mitted to prison
on the shortest
notice. At the
same time, it may
be perpetrated in
all good faith, so
that you may let
one of your best
characters be
guilty of it by ac-
cident. Then he
will promptly be
handcuffed and led
away from tlie
heart - broken
heroine, and your
readers will weep
like anything.
Will. No legal
document is so
useful to the novel-
ist as this. Be sure
to remember that
no one in your
novel must make a
will until they are
at the point of
death! Then " the
family lawyer" is
hastily summoned,
and, after the will
has been signed,
it will be placed in
one of the usual
repositories for
in a secret drawer
such documents, viz.,
which no one knows of, in the coal-scuttle,
which will be sold (with the will inside it)
upon the testator's death, or in the breast-
pocket of the nearest villain. In the first
case, the heroine will accidentally touch
the spring of the secret drawer ten years
afterwards; in the second, a mysterious
figure will appear to the hero at midnight,
bidding him buy the coal-scuttle at any
cost; in the third, the villain will subse-
quently die of remorse, and, in a chapter
headed "At Last!" the long-sought-for
document will reappear. A. C. D.

[October 30, 1901.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mr. Andrew Lang has contributed Alfred Tennyson to Messrs.
Blackwood's now series of Modern English Writers. "This
brief sketch of the life of Tennyson " he calls it, on tho principle
that it adds nothing new to man's knowledge of the theme.
Mr. LANG is loftily indifferont to ordinary requirements for
such a work. Common people may stoop to narrative and
details. He soars aloft in sublime superiority. In the preface,
he frankly tells the snubbed reader that ho will find nothing in
the book that may not be read at fuller length in the Biography
the second Lord Tennyson dutifully laid on his father's tomb.
"As to the Life," Mr. LANG writes, "doubtless current anecdotes
not given in the Biography are known to me and [now this is
condescending] to most people. But as they must also be
familiar to the author of the Biography, I have not thought it
desirable to give them. The work of the ' localizers' I have not
read. Tho professed commentators I have not consulted."
The result of this superfine system is not such that my Baronite
can conscientiously recommend it to writers of ordinary calibre.
There is nothing new in the book, not even the long quota-
tions from Idylls of the King and In Memoriam. Mr. Lang,
having in the manner indicated barred himself out from the
way of the vulgar biographer, and having 230 pages to fill
up, has hit upon the device of discovering Tennyson,
explaining to the startled reader the story of tho Idylls, In
Memoriam, and some others, quoting passages therefrom, and
illuminating them with critical remarks. This is very obliging.
But as most of us have TENNYSON on our shelves, if not on the
tip of our tongue, we prefer to go to the fountain head and
drink as we desire. After all, there is something to be said for
ancient ways.
An Occasional Critic in the employment of the Baron ventures
to suggest that Tlie Lords of Life, written by (presumably) Miss
Bessie Dill, and published by Mr. John Long (whose name he
inadvertently omitted last week as publisher of The Diva), is
not without its charm. The heroine's character undergoes
formation during the course of 856 pages. In page 20 she—at
the age of ten—shows traces of agnosticism, and in page 354
informs her first betrothed of her earlier flirtations. The Occa-
sional Critic ventures to recommend The Lords of Life to the
not too exacting novel-reader.
My Juniorest Baronitess says that, in her opinion, The
Octopus, by Frank Norris (Grant Richards), is a most inter-
esting Californian story. It tells of the war that at one time
raged between the wheat grower and the Railroad Trust. The
principal characters are all well drawn ; but the two that make
most demand upon tho reader's sympathies are, Annixter (pro-
prietor of tho Qui on Sabe Rancho), and Mima Tree, a dairy girl
on Annixter's ranch. The love scene between these two is
quite the prettiest part of the book. The last chapter, where
Behrham (the representative of the Pacific and South-Western
Railroad) meets his death, is dramatically effective. My
Juniorest adds that, as a book of more than mere passing
interest, it is worthy of, at least, a permanent place on the top
shelf of a library.
The Potter and the Clay first saw the light in the United
States, and was brought hither by Messrs. Hodder and
StougHTON, who have a keen eye for a promising new writer.
It is reported that the author, Maud Howard Peterson, is
still in her teens. That is no particular business of the
reader's, who simply wants a good book for his six shillings,
even if he has eighteenpence taken off by way of discount.
But the fact, if it be one, certainly increases the admiration
compelled by a notable piece of work. Miss Peterson, living
in America, is evidently old enough to have visited Scotland,
both on the East and "West Coast. If she has not also been to
India, she has a remarkablo gift for assimilating information.
Her picture of the plague-stricken barracks and village is
remarkably vivid. As to the moving story, it is hard to realise
a man of Robert Trevelyan's proved courage deliberately malin-
gering in order to escape the danger of leading a forlorn hope,
a prize pressed upon his acceptance to the envy of his fellow
officers. He confesses that ho was suddenly transformed into
a coward for very love. If he wont forth he might (a) get shot;
(I)) death might ensue; (c) being a corpse, all hope of marrying
Cary was lost. Q. E. P. But who shall say what mere man is
not capable of when his actions are devised in the imagination
of a woman. Probabilities apart, Miss Peterson makes a fine
study of the desperation and. remorse of Trevelyan, of the
unselfish heroism of John Stewart, and of the wavering affection
of Cary, loved from childhood by both. For a first novel it is
notable. My Baronite sees in it the promise of even more
excellent things to follow.
For Our Lady of Deliverance (Hutchinson) Mr. John Ox en ham
has utilised tho tragedy of Dreyfus, to whom the book is
inscribed. It is, however, only the main fact of an officer in
the French Army being falsely accused of treason that is bor-
rowed. Mr. Oxenham invents his own machinery for the
vindication and triumph of the victim. It is a little crude,
falling away from the workmanship of an excellent start.
Oddly enough, he docs not explain how the mad painter came
to have sittings from Mademoiselle, why ho turned up at tho
Chateau, or why, indeed, he came into tho story at all. My
Baronite recognises in the bulldog the best-drawn character
in tho book.
The Baron has just got through The Real Christian, by LUCAS
Cleeve (John Long), and has come out alive. The Real Christian
—not the "ideal" you will understand, no, nor anything like
it—is apparently a rather muddle-beaded barrister who refuses
to defend his client imprisoned on a charge of murder, because
he happens to have been present when said prisoner talked and
walked in his sleep, and in that state acted the crime he had
committed just as did Matthias in the Erckmann-Chatrian story
of Le Juif Polonais. This very unprofessional barrister, Harold,
not "Skimpole" but Trafford, falls in love with a girl who
by mistake marries somebody else; whereupon he becomes a
Catholic priest, in which character, being even more dunder-
headed than he was as a barrister, ho wears the soutane, be-
lieves in nothing in particular, not much in himself, and dies
suddenly " on the hillside outside " ("hillside outside " sounds
odd, rather suggestive of "inside outside," some mysterious
sort of complicated complaint) "a country town," where he is
preaching to a crowd of " upturned faces." Only " faces," no
bodies to speak of. This is the sort of person whom LUCAS
Cleeve sets before us as "The Real Christian." If we are to
have law or theology in a novel, its author should first satisfy
legal or qualified theological examiners as to his proficiency
or soundness. But amateur law, or, what is more mischievous,
amateur theology, ought to be entirely avoided.
The Baron de B.-W.
P. S.—With the prospect of Christmas before them, the] pub-
lishers (Raphael Tuck and Sons) have not forgotten to specially
cater for the children. There is a "Painting Book," entitled
Father Tuck's "Little Artists " Series, which will undoubtedly
fill the heart of every child with joy. Moreover, it will provo
a boon to parents, for it is calculated to keep the noisiest of
children quiet for any length of time ; and they will remember
it in their pleasant dreams when Tuck'd into their little beds.
"Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee ;" or, Lord Rosebery and
Mr. Winston Churchill on "Harris Tweeds,"—though his
Lordship can hardly be styled "Tweedle-dtimb." Pity that
neither of them showed their proficiency as students of Dickens
by bringing in any allusion to Betsey Prig, who, as she didn't
believe as there were no sich a person as Mrs. Harris, couldn't
have trusted the tweeds of that name.

THOMPSON ON "TINNED COW."
I.
Tin Lin Chow was his proper name, but we called him
"Tinned Cow," though he never much liked it, and said that
his father, who was a Mandarin, or some such thing, would
have made it hot for us if we had been in China. But we were
at Merivale School in England, so we reckoned that "Tinned
Cow " was near enough, that being good English anyway.
The chap was exactly the same colour as the stomach of
"Corkey" Minor's guinea-pig; and his father was allowed to
wear a gold button in his hat, so he said, that being a sign of a
man who wrote books in China. He wrote Chinese books for a
living, and when we asked "Tinned Cow" if his father could
turn out stuff a patch on Hentv or MaYxe Reid, he said mucli
better. But he had to confess afterwards that his father was
only doing a history of China in a hundred volumes, or some
such muck; so evidently he was no real good, for all his
gold button.
When the kid first came to learn English and get English
ideas—owing to his father lia ving convinced himself that Chinese
customs were rotten—he rather gave himself airs, and seemed
to think because he was somebody at Pekin he must be at
Merivale ; but the only person who made anything of him was
the Doctor. He used to bring everything round to China—
even arithmetic, and he evidently thought it was rather line
to have a Mandarin's son in the school. Especially as "Tinned
Cow" had brothers coming on, who might follow. What a
Mandarin is exactly, "Tinned Cow" didn't know himself; but
he seemed to think they were about equal to Dukes, which
must be rot, because Dukes can be- Kings in time, whereas
Mandarins can't be Emperors. In fact, the only Mandarins 1
ever heard of till then were oranges.
He was a frightful liar, but good as a maker of kites. And
Browne, the classical master in the Third and Lower Fourth,
said that both things were common to the Chinese character.
For mere lies we had Fowle and Steggles, and others, even
better than "Tinned Cow," because his knowledge of English
wasn't up to lying without being found out for some terms;
but at kites he could smash anybody. His kites, in fact, were
corkers, and he taught us to kito-flght, which is not bad sport
when there's nothing better on. Chinese kites are very light,
and all made of tissue-paper and cane, or bamboo, split up
fine. For a cane, "Tinned Cow" had the beautiful cheek to
go into Doctor Dunstan's study, when he was reading prayers
in the chapel, and rout about in the cane-corner and steal a
good specimen, and hide if in the gym. That was the first
thing that made me like the kid. But he said it was nothing,
and seemed surprised that I thought much of it. He also said
that over the pictures in a huge Shakspeare the Doctor had,
was tissue-paper of such a choice kind that it must undoubtedly
be Chinese, and that, if so, it was the best in the world for
kites. He said that if I would allow him to be my chum, he
would get several sheets of this paper in a quiet moment, and
make mo the best kite he had yet made. Well, I never guessed
then what a Chinese kid really is in the way of being a worm,
so I agreed, provided ho made two kites and put my initials on
them in silver paper from a packet of cigarettes—the initials,
of course, being J. H. T. They stand for John Henning
Thompson—merely Thompson now, but Thompson Major next
term, when my young brother comes to Merivale.
The chap was so frightfully keen to becomo my chum (my
being captain of the second footer eleven) that he agreed to
the two kites without a murmur, and stole the tissue-paper and
used the cane for the framework. So, rather curiously, the
tissue-paper from a swagger Shakspeare and a bit of one of old
Dunstan's canes soared up to a frightful height overthe school;
and it happened that the Doctor saw it, and, little dreaming of
the materials, patted " Tinned Cow " on the head, and greatly
praised him, and said that the art of kite-flying in China was
tremendously ancient, and that in the matter of kites, as well
as many other more important things, China had instructed the
world. Yet, when FULLER tried to sneak a quill pen for a
private purpose, believing the Doctor was not in the study at
the time, whereas he had merely gone behind a screen to find a
book, Fuller got five hundred lines and the Eighth Command-
ment to translate into Latin and Greek, and French and German.
Which shows that to be found out is its own punishment, as
Steggles told Fuller afterwards. •
Well, I let " Tinned Cow" be my chum, and found him fairly
decent, considering he was a heathen, for two terms. Then he
began to settle down and learn English and football, and say
that Merivale was better by long chalks than China. In fact,
he rather hated China really, and said, except for toys and
sweets and fireworks, that England was really better. I may
mention that his feet were small, but not like pictures, and he
said that only wretched girls had their feet squashed in his
country. He had a sister whose feet were squashed, and he
said that she was pretty, which must have been rot; but he
had to admit that English girls were prettier, because Mathers
made him, and said that he'd tattoo a lion and unicorn on the
middle of his chest if he didn't. So he yielded; in fact, he
always yielded very readily to force, though I often tried to
arrange a fight for him. He had no idea even of doubling a
decent fist, and said that only wild beasts fight without proper
weapons. But once ho took on Bray with single-sticks, and
they chose a half-holiday and went into the wood by the
cricket-ground and fought well for two hours and a half; and a
bruise on a Chinese skin is very interesting to see. Bray
turned yellow, then blue, that deepened to black on thp fourth
day; but "Tinned Cow," from the usual putty-like tint of his
body, went lead-colour where Bray whacked his arm and leg.
And "Tinned Cow's " bravery surprised me; butitwas a draw,
and he assured me that he didn't care a bit about being alive,
and would have gone on hammering and being hammered until
Bray had killed him if necessary. He said that in his country,
when two chaps are going to fight, they begin by cutting
frightful attitudes, and standing in rum and awful positions,
and sticking out their muscles and making faces, like Ajax defy-
ing the lightning in Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities. This the
idiots do, each hoping to terrify the other chap, and funk him,
and so defeat him without striking a blow. '' Tinned Cow'' said
that most battles were settled in this way; and once, when
Martin Minimus called him a yellow weasel, he puffed out his
cheeks and frowned, as well as you can without eyebrows, and
crooked his hands like a bird's claws and tried to horrify Mar-
tin Minimus, which he did; but it was young Martin's first term,
and the kid was barely eight years old.
Now I come to that little brute Milly Dunstan, the Doctor's
youngest daughter. Shedidn't care much about " Tinned Cow"
at first, for she always takes about three terms to see what a
new chap's like; but after the Mandarin in China had sent
Doctor Dunstan a gift of some rusty armour and screens and old
religious books—more like window-blinds than decent books—
and a live Chinese dog with a tongue like as if it had been lick-
ing ink, then Milly, who's the greediest little hateful wrotch,
even for a girl, I ever saw, suddenly dropped Mathers, whose
father was merely a lawyer, and began to encourage "Tinned
Cow " like anything. He didn't understand her character as I
and a few other chaps did. Tomkins and Mathers and Fordyce
knew her real nature, because she had pretty well absorbed all
their pocket money for term after term; and so I told "Tinned
Cow" that her blue eyes and curls and ways generally were
simply a white-washed sepulchre, and certainly wouldn't last
longer than a hamper from Pekin; which, I told him, he'd jolly
soon find out. But there's nothing so obstinate as the Chinese
nation; and if she'd asked him for his pigtail, I believe "Tinned
Cow" would have chopped it off for her, though he would not
have dared to return home to his own country after that till
he'd grown a new one.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
It seemed rather a horrid thing,
Mathers said, for a Christian girl to
encourage a chap the colour of parsnips,
not to mention his eyes, which were like
button-holes: but that was only because
MrLLY had chucked Mathers; and we all
knew what she really was; and, as Yates
said, she'd have sacrificed her whole family
for a new sort of lemon drop; and of course
when "Tinned Cow" found out how mad
she was after sweets, he wrote to China, to
his mother, for the best sweets in Pekin;
which she sent. But while he was waiting
for them, the Chinese dog got homesick
or something, and bit the boot-boy and
was poisoned painlessly. Still, Milly
stuck to " Tinned Cow,'' and walked openl y
about the playing fields on match-days
with him. And people said it was just
like Doctor DUNSTAN'S dear little girl to
encourage a poor, lonely, foreign kid; but
we knew what she was waiting for well
enough.
In fact, "Tinned Cow" had translated
part of his letter home to me. It was in
Chinese characters, and went down the
paper instead of along, and looked as if
you'd dipped a grasshopper in ink and
then put him out to dry. But his mother
evidently understood, and sent such sweets
as were never before sucked in England
—since the Christian era very likely. And
"Tinned Cow" had also asked for one of
his mother's rings for Milly; but this he
didn't much expect her to send; and she
didn't. So he bought Milly a ring from
a proper ring-shop with three weeks'
pocket money; which, seeing that he had
the huge sum often bob a week, amounted
to thirty shillings, and it had a real
precious stone in it, though no one exactly
knew what.
Anyway, Milly wore it at chapel, and
flashed it at "Tinned Cow" when the
Doctor had his back turned saying the
Litany. And Mathers said the flash of it
was like a knife in his heart. Which shows
what a footling ass Mathers was over this
wretched girl. I warned "Tinned Cow,"
all the same, that he 'd simply chucked
thirty bob away; because she'd change
again the moment his Chinese sweets were
finished. And she never gave back pre-
sents when she changed; as Millbhook
had found to his cost, being an awfully
rich chap, who gave her a bracelet that
cost three pounds ten. And when she
threw him over and wouldn't give it up,
Millbrook, who was certainly rich but a
frightful hound, went to the Doctor. So
he got his bracelet and left soon after-
wards; and Milly, much to her horror,
was sent to a boarding school for a term
or two. But then old Dunstan, who is
simply an infant in Milly's hands, gave
way and let her come home again because
she cried over a letter and splashed it with
tears, or, more likely, common water, and
told him that nobody in the world could |
teach her Greek but him. Which shows i
the cunningness of her. And many such-
like things she did, of which I will tell you
later. E. P.

Miss Snippet.
"I can't think why I go on paying that
wretched little dressmaker half-a-crown a
day to give mo a figure like this," said
Gwendolen, regarding herself ruefully in
the over-mantel mirror. "I'm a cross
between Richard the Third and the
scarecrow."

posterous. Let me see. She's boon here
a week. That's six half-crowns. How
many pounds is that, Jack?"
"Six half-crowns?" I prepared to
tackle the problem.
"Oh, well, never mind! Anyway, it's
far too much money to waste on Miss
Snippet, besides food and—and things.
And you know you don't like having her
m the house."
"Well, I confess I shouldn't mind
getting back to my study."
"I knew she was getting on your nerves.
You were perfectly horrid at luncheon."
"My dear, when the same face appears
every day at every meal—when it isn't
yours, that is to say"
"Well, you shan't have it any more,
dear. I'm going to give up the Snippet
thing; and make my dresses myself. It '11
save—oh, pounds and pounds, Jack! And
then we '11 bo able to get that sweet little
Chippendale book-case we saw the other
day in Wardour Street."
Bent on her policy of peace, retrench-
ment and reform, Gwendolen propoied
that very evening that we should run up
to town next day and purchase the raw
material for the experiment. A long
afternoon was spent in the purlieus of
Piccadilly. Hitherto we had patronised
Oxford Street, but, as Gwendolen pointed
out, we could now afford the most expen-
sive stuffs, as it was the making that cost,
and that was to cost nothing. So many
purchases were made that wo lost our
last train homo. That, however, mattered
the less as I wanted to see the new piece
at tho Lyceum, which I thought might
give me some ideas for the tragedy I was
writing ; and as we had half-an-hour to
put in before dinner, we strolled along to
Wardour Street to have another look at
the book-case.
Gwendolen eyed it longingly. "Oh,
Jack! Think of our Aldines in thoso
shelves!"
"Yes, and the Elzevirs!"
"Wouldn't it just make the study?"
"It most certainly would."
"How many half-crowns are there in
thirty pounds?"
I took out a piece of paper, and was
preparing to multiply by twenty, twelve
and four, when suddenly I felt Gwendo-
len clutch me nervously by tho arm.
"Jack !" she whispered. "Ho's ask-
ing about it!"
"Who, dear? '*
"That man."
I looked round. Whilst I had been deep
in my calculation, a customer had entered
the shop. Hot a moment was to be lost.
Quick as thought, Gwendolen drew her
hand from my arm and followed him. A
minute later, the book-case was ours.
As we discussed a little supper after
the play that night, GWENDOLEN suddenly
turned on me indignant. "Jack," she
said, "you 're thinking!"
"My dear," I protested.
"Don't try to deny it! You know I
don't allow it at meals. Now, what was
it all about?"
"Well," I admitted, "I believe 1 was
thinking in a hazy sort of way what a
blessing it is to have an economical
wife."
Gwendolen smiled.
"We've had a day in town, an excel-
lent dinner, stalls at the theatre, a capi-
tal supper"
"And the book-case"
"Yes, to be sure; and as far as I can
make out it all costs us less than nothing."
"Of course it does. It will all be saved
out of Miss Snippet; and you shall see
I'm going to be dressed far better than
ever."

Cor. (huffed). What do you
want me to do then?
Men. Only to be civil to

grievances. They always have
grievances, confound them!
Cor. (grumbling). Well, you'll

Com. (to Menenius). There's
the Money-lenders' Bill. He might

Men. Yes. That will do. Tell them if
they elect you they won't have to pay
their debts. They'll like that. Then
there's the Corn Laws. Tell them about
the inalienable right of every citizen to
be fed at someone else's expense. And
the Franchise,—say you believe in One
Man One Vote and One Vote One Value.
Cor. (scratching Jits head). And what

man can sell his vote for Ave shillings, of

Cor. (to whom this sounds an eminently
reasonable measure of reform). Is that all?
I don't mind promising my support to
that.
Men. Then there's Taxation of Ground

Cor. (doubtfulhj). But I don't know any-

I wish you'd let me make 'em a rousing
speech about the war.

sake! No more speeches, my dear fellow.
Cor. (obstinate!;/). I believe you 're
wrong. Just you lot me tell 'em how I
took Corioli! (With immense gusto.) It
was this way. There was the town bang
to hear about " our valiant soldiery." If
you tell them they ran like hares you

Cor. (sulkily). If you want someone who

Men. (soothing him). COMINIUS only
means that in describing our soldiers you
should make the best of things and gloss
over any little defects. The

"TO MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FIT
THE CRIME."
Dear Mr. Punch, — According to a
morning paper, after the discovery of
a recent plot against the Shah, one of
the prominent personages implicated in
the conspiracy was punished by being
paraded stark-naked through the streets
of Teheran.
An excellent idea! Surely there is much
to be said for its application to English
political and other misdemeanours. The
Secretary for War, for example — for
weeks the Radical Press have been de-
manding his head on a charger, naturally
in vain. Mr. Brodrick'S head remains
where it has always been, on his own
shoulders.
But if the Daily Neuis had demanded
that Mr. Brodrick should be escorted
down Piccadilly by the police, clad only
in his shirt, their demand would have
been at once more picturesque and more
reasonable.
This policy has already been tried on
a small scale in this country with con-
spicuous success. Was not Mr. William
O'Brien on one occasion, when imprisoned
for his devotion to Erin, deprived of his
trousers? And what is good for an Irish
patriot is surely good enough for a brutal
Saxon!
Let us take example from Persia with-
out delay. Let all generals who in
future make indiscreet speeches be ex-
hibited to the people, in Trafalgar Square,
clothed mainly in their socks. Let Cabinet
Ministers whose policy does not meet with
the approval of the popular press attend
at the Palace of Westminster in a bathing
costume. And let undistinguished mem-
bers of the Opposition who are in the
habit of addressing public meetings in
the Boer interest be compelled to make
those speeches in pyjamas.
In this manner military discipline will
be maintained, political efficiency secured,
and treasonable utterances discounten-
anced.—Yours, dear Mr. P.,
Tom Noddy.
WHERE'S AIR?
Let faddists declare
The delights of fresh air.
Their throats to the knife of the East let
them bare,
And revel at will
In the draughts that blow shrill
With a swirl and a rush through the roots
of their hair.
But I, if you please,
Beg to differ from these,
When the fogs of November teach mortals
to wheeze,
And a thousand aches seize
On one's elbows and knees,
And one's marrow doth freeze,
And life's one long wheeze,
And with horror one sees
Emerge by degrees,
Thick as bees
In lime-trees,
Or as mites in a cheese,
The palpable symptoms of every disease,
That was ever invented by learned M.D.'s.
Then my windows I close
Ere I seek my repose,
And I use every means ingenuity knows
To shut out the fog
That would poison a dog—
'Tis a death one would spare to one's
bitterest foes.
Yes, though we are told
That fresh air is as gold,
Worth more than the costliest gems that
are sold,
Though its praise be extolled,
Though the faddists may scold
At my notions of old,
I will not be cajoled,
But be bold
To uphold
That a man with a cold
Had better by far in his blankets be rolled
Than breathing the microbes that lurk in
each fold
Of a "London particular," yellow as gold.
SHORT TALE OF A TIQER.
"I must put in my 'operative claws,'"
As the tiger said to the Solicitor;
"Agree with you I don't!" cried the
student of laws;
"But you will I" growled the tiger. End

Is much in default and will not pay
Its interest up to date;
"With coupons terribly overdue,
What is the thing you decide to do?
You say, " I'll put on a bit of screw."

THE Nominator had exhausted his list.
He had summoned all and every, and
scores, nay hundreds, nay thousands, had
appeared in his catalogue as worthy of a
medal.
"Yes," said he, " I think we have got
all we can. We allowed the man who
had seen the engagement through a tele-
scope at a distance of fifteen miles?"
"We did, Sir."
"And we made no objection to the man
who reached the scene of action the next
day when all the fighting was over. We
allowed him too?"
"We did, Sir. You decided that the
unpunctuality of a train should not be
permitted to rob a warrior of his just
reward."
"Quite right. Well, now I think we
can close the office and go home."
"I beg your pardon."
A weather-worn, war-'worn veteran
stood at the door. He had but one leg
and his left arm was in a sling.
"Well, Sir. What can I do for you?"
"I have come to know if I may have a
medal, Sir?"
"Have you the qualifications? Were
you in the neighbourhood of the fight?"
"I was at the front of the battle from
morning until night—from the sound of
the first shot to the call for cease firing."
"That sounds all right. I wonder why
I have not got your name. Pray let me
shake hands with you."
"I must give you my left hand, Sir,
which is still a little shaky. My right
has been amputated."
"You were badly wounded in the
engagement?"

"Well, yes, I suppose so. But not

Until then I saved a good many poor
fellows by carrying them out of action."
"Worthy of the Victoria Cross!"
"Well, scarcely. Certainly other
fellows have got it for less, but that
doesn't matter. I have come only for a
medal."
"And, my brave fellow, you seem to
have deserved it. What's your name?"
"Burleigh Forbes Russell Steevens
Henty Williams Jones. A good many
names, but all of them appropriate."
"Oh, certainly. And now for your
regiment?"
The veteran paused for a moment and
then the blood in his cheeks deepened in
their rod. "I have no regiment, Sir. I
did my duty as a member of the Press."
"As a member of the Press!" cried
the Nominator. "Asking for a medal as
a member of the Press! Too absurd!
Why we don't give medals to members of
the Press."
"It 's a crying shame that you
don't!"
But the Nominator, being accustomed
to the eloquence of Fleet Street, merely
nodded. Then he looked cheerfully to-
wards his visitor and observed, "Next,
please! May I trouble you, as you leave,
to close the door."
The Veteran courteously obeyed, and
the Press were shut out. But not shut up.

THE BOOK OF BEAUTY.
A Great Thought for Every Day in the Year.
Second Series.
X.—THE HENRY JAMES SECTION.
(Continued from October.)
17th.—I'd scarce done asking myself -whether I'd formu-
lated my enquiry into the identity of this Sansjambes,
■who was to marry Vivien Cheveley, -with an air of sufficient
detachment, or, in default of this, had so clearly underlined
the suggestion of indifference by my manner of manipulating
my cigarette as to assure myself against the possible suspicion,
easily avoidable, I had hoped, of a too immediately concerned
curiosity, when "Ah! the fellow without legs!" replied
MaLLABY, with, as it, perhaps unwarrantably, seemed to me,
a levity so flippant that it might have appalled a controver-
sialist less seasoned by practice than I'd the permissible
satisfaction of crediting myself with the reputation of being.
"But you have not then lost it?" I threw off, on a note of
implicit irony.
"Lost what?" he asked.
"Your old facility, of course, in jeux d'esprit," I explained.
"On the contrary," he replied, "my translation of Sans-
jambes is not more literal than the facts themselves I"
18th.—His answer was so quite what I had not foreseen, that
I was surprised, as by a sudden reflex jerk of the muscles, into
an unwonted lucidity of diction.
"How did he lose them?" I asked.
"He didn't; he never had any to lose!" Mallaby, with
unnecessary brutality, replied. "An early ancestor lost his
under the walls of Acre. Pre-natal influences affected his first-
born, and ever since then the family has had no legs in the
direct line."
"But the title?"—I was still too altogether the sport of
surexcitation nicely to weigh my words.
"The gallant ancestor's own choice—prior, naturally, to the
birth of his heir—to perpetuate the deed of prowess that won
it. And his descendants take it on as a matter of pride."
19th.—By this I'd sufficiently recovered my habitual aplomb
to be in a position, while reserving my perfected conclusions
for a less disturbing occasion, to collate, as I sipped my drink,
a few notes on the comparative periods of sustained effervescence
in the cases, respectively, of Seltzer and Salutaris.
"And the cause you assign to this projected marriage?" I
then, less with a desire for enlightenment, asked, than, my own
judgment being made up to the point of finality, to seem to
flatter him by an appeal to his.
"Oh, there's money, of course," he answered. "But that
isn't all. It's the old tale—Eve, apple, curiosity, with a touch
of the brute thrown in 1"
20th.— You could have knocked me down, in the vulgar phrase,
with a feather. Here was Guy Mallaby, immeasurably my
unequal in fineness of spirit, laying his fat finger plumb on the
open offence, while I was still complacently nosing it on a false
scent of Womanly Pity. True, he had enjoyed a three-months
start of me in the running down of a mystery that doubled too
distractingly on its traces for that instinctive flair to which I
hitherto had urged a predominant claim; or was it the cook-
wife that had piqued, through the stomach's Sacred Fount, his
intellectual appetite? Gratuitously to admit him my superior
on the strength of a forestalled judgment was the last of a quite
surprising number of alternatives that just then occurred to
me. "I'm going to look in on Lady Jane," I made evasion.
"She '11, if she's honest, endorse my conjecture; she's a
woman!" he, without hesitation, observed.
218T, 22nd.—More interestingly stimulated than I could, at
the moment, remember to have been by any previous visit to
the Prytaneum, I made my way westward down the Mall of
St. James's Park, taking the broad boulevard on the left. In
the particular atmosphere of exaltation by which I perceived
myself to be environed, it was easy to image these widowed
avenues in their midsummer fulness, to revive their inarticu-
late romance, to restore, in the grand style, the pomp of their
verdurous pageantry. Oh, there was quite enough of analogy
to reclothe a whole Arden of As you like it! It was really
portentous on what a vista of alluring speculations I'd all
but originally stumbled; virgin forest, in fact, before the
temerity of just one pioneer, and that a woman, had stripped it
this very summer so pitilessly bare. With how fine an abstrac-
tion from the moralities I'd, in the way of pure analysis, have
probed its fungus-roots, have dissected its saffron-bellied toads,
have sampled its ambiguous spices. And to have utilised a
legless abortion for the genius of its lush undergrowths!
23RD, 24th—But I soon became aware of an appreciable recoil
from the first poignancy of self-reproach at being anticipated
by the author of Sir Richard Calmady, when, upon a more meti-
culous reflection—for, by this time, I'd arrived opposite the
footpath leading over the bridge that commands the lake and its
collection, recognisably unique, of water-fowl—I'd convinced
myself how little of consonance was to be found between this
theme and the general trend of my predilections. About the
loves of a so ineffable prodigy—and to differentiate them as law-
ful or lawless didn't, for me, modify the fact of their uniform
repulsiveness—I detected a quality something too preposterously
flagrant, an element un pen trop criant of pungent indelicacy.
It needed only this flash of recognition at once to disabuse me
of all regret for having been forestalled in the treatment of a
subject of which the narrow scope it offered for the play of
hypersensitized subtlety remained the incurably fatal defect.
25th.—So immediate, indeed, and so absolute was my mental
recovery that I had scarce cleared the facade of Buckingham
Palace and addressed myself to what I have, from time to time,
regarded as the almost contemptibly easy ascent of Constitu-
tion Hill, before I had in mind to rush to the opposite extreme,
totally, in fact, to disregard the relation of legs to the question
at issue. I won't, I said, allow the hereditary absence of this
feature from the Count's ensemble to prejudice, one way or
another, the solution, which I hope ultimately to achieve, of
the original problem, namely, should I, or shouldn't I, offer my
congratulations to Yivien Cheveley; and that second problem,
subordinately associated with the first, namely, what form, if
any, should those congratulations assume?
26th, 27th.—But I was instantly to perceive the super-pre-
cipitancy of my revulsion. It imposed itself, and with a clarity
past all possible ignoring, that in this matter of the Count's
legs, the introduction of a new element—or, to be accurate, the
withdrawal of an old one, so usual as to have been carelessly
assumed—was bound, whatever dissimulation was attempted,
to command notice. The gentleman's lower limbs were, to an
undeniably overwhelming degree, conspicuous, as the phrase
runs, by their absence. A fresh condition, as unique as it was
unforeseen, had, with a disturbing vitality, invaded what had
given promise, in the now remote outset, of being an argument
on merely abstract and impersonal lines. For, even if one
postulated in the bride the delicatest of motives, a passion,
let us assume, to repair a defect of Nature, as much as to say,
figuratively, "You that are blind shall see through my eyes,"
or, more literally, "You, having no legs to speak of, are to find
in me a vicarious locomotion," even so a sensitive creature
might wince at the suspicion that the language of congratula-
tion was but a stammering tribute to the quality, in her, of
inscrutable heroism. And there was still an equal apprehension
to deplore, should it appear that it was to an artistic faculty,
on the lady's part, capable, imaginatively, of reconstructing,
from the fragmentary outlines of his descendant, the originally
unimpaired completeness of the gallant ancestor—much as the
old moon shows dimly perfect in the hollow of the young cres-
cent—that the Count owed his acceptability in her eyes.
28th.—"There it is!" I said, and at the same moment

Ojfii-sr {to Irish sentry on guard le>U). "Why don't you face your PROPER front,
SENTRY'?"
Sentry. "Sure, yer honour, the tint's round. Divil a front it's got!"
inadvertently grasped the extended hand
a constable at the corner of Hamilton
Place; "there's no escaping from the
obsession of this inexorable fact. It
colours the whole abstract problem only
a little less irritatingly than, I can well
believe, it has coloured the poor Count's
existence." And I'd scarce so much
as begun to exhaust the possible bearings
of the case in their absorbing relation to
simply me, as distinct from the parties
more deeply committed and so, presum-
ably, exposed to the impact of yet other
considerations.
29th.—For, what lent a further com-
plexity to the situation was that, even
to suppose me arrived at the conclusion,
effectively supported, that her motive for
this so painfully truncated alliance was
commendable, it still left her the liberty,
accentuated by the conditions at which I
have glanced, to misinterpret mine in con-
gratulating her upon ft. And if, on the
other hand, her engagement were attri-
butable to unworthy or frivolous causes,
wouldn't the consciousness of this, on her
side, give even stronger countenance to a
suspicion of mere impertinence on mine?
30th.—That her motive indeed had been
no better than one of curiosity—mother
Eve's, in fact, for exploring the apple-
tree—was the contention of Mallaby,
and by him expressed with so resolved
an assurance that it had, as I only now
remembered, won me over, at the time,
by its convincing probability. Hadn't his
confidence even gone the length of claim-
ing Lady JANE as of the same camp? And
this recalled for me, what I had tempo-
rarily ignored in the so conflicting rush
of ideas, the primary objective of my
present excursion. I 'd overlooked the
bifurcation of ways where the traverse to
South Audley Street leads in the direc-
tion of Lady Jane's house; and now was
poising irresolutely before crossing at
the convergence of Upper Brook Street
and Park Lane.
31st.—But after all, I asked myself, was
a woman's final word really just the thing
I stood in dearest need of in so nice a
hesitancy? If I was conscious of a certain
strain in seeking to confine this incident
of freakish abbreviation to its properly
obscure place in the picture, would not
slie, with all her sex's reluctance to attack
any question from an abstract standpoint,
experience an insuperable difficulty in
assigning to the. Count's deficiency its
relative " value"? And mightn't I, in a
moment of unguarded gallantry, of simu-
lated deference, let mo put it, to her
assumption of a larger knowledge of
women, or, say, simply a more profound
intimacy with the particular woman, be
carried away, against what I foresaw,
even at this incipient stage of my reflec-
tions, would, in the event, turn out to be
my better judgment, on a veritable whirl
of grossly material considerations? At
worst, after all, there's still, I said, the
last resort of an answer in the third
person, declining the wedding invitation
on a plea, strictly untrue, of an earlier
engagement. Meantime, while so many
hitherto unregarded aspects of the matter
called on my intelligence for their dues,
the fabric of my problem was, I told myself,
of a delicacy too exquisite for

THE CURSE OF EDUCATION.
SCENE—A Scotch Moor.
Time.—During the Recess recently inter-
rupted by a Cabinet.
Chorus of Ministers.
WHEN, at length, our toils are ended,
Passing sweet to lie extended,
With a glass of "finest blended,"
'Mid our bulging bags of grouse;
Passing sweet in halcyon weather,
Thus to lie and lunch together
Here amid the purple heather,
All oblivious of the House.
Passing sweet, too, this reflection,
Adding zest to our refection,
As we con the recollection
Of our midnight labours past:
By our prudent legislation,
We have saved the English nation
From the curse of education—
She is safe and sound at last.
Enter Chorus of Bairns.
Wee bit bairns frae schule are we—
Good little bairns as bairns can be;
Learnin' the rudiments o'AB C—
Wee bittie bairns frac schule.
First Min. They sing, no doubt, expressing
jubilation
To us who have effected their salvation
And saved them from the curse of
education.
Chorus of Bairns.
We are wantin' fine tae ken
Bulks an' a' thae things, for then,
Teacher says, we '11 be guid men—
Wee bittie bairns frae schule.
First Min. What! you like school where
you are caned and shaken?
Dear children, you are wof ully mistaken!
We are your friends, and mean to fill
your cup
Of happiness by shutting schoolrooms up.
In good Queen Bess's golden days
No School Boards did their standards
raise.
The girls were merry maidens then,
And did not ape the ways of men;
They did not trip to short-hand schools,
And type all day on oflico stools;
They were not taught at school to dance,
Nor mispronounce the tongue of France.
They learnt to sew and scrub the floor,
And if they learn these things once
more,
So bright will shine Great Britain's rays
As in Queen Bess's glorious days.
The boys were not all anxious then
To wield a junior-clerkly pen;
They did not all to London come
To live in crowded court and slum;
They did not starve on buns and teas
At inexpensive A. B. C.'s;
They were not half of them rle trop,
And all too old at forty—No!
They learnt to plough and saw and plane,
And if they learn these things again,
So bright will shine Great Britain's rays
As in Queen Bess's glorious days.
Enter Chorus of Scotch Professors.
False Ministers, hold!
We have heard what you say,
And the views you unfold
Make our hair turn to grey;
But we have a word for the children
Whom you would send empty away.
You would make us all ignorant, all,
As an ox that is kept in a stall,
But, thanks to Carnegie, your policy
plaguy
Is destined to come by a fall.
He 's given us plenty of gold,
And so you will find yourselves sold,
For, in spite of your preaching, we '11
still go on teaching
Whatever there is to be told.
And unless you see fit to take heed
Of England's more clamorous need,
All Cabinet work '11 be kept in a circle
That hails from the North of the Tweed.
First Min. Pooh! brats like those in ragged
clothes?
A fig for your suggestion!
To think of these as sworn P.C.'s
Is quite beyond the question.
But let that be. This thought had we—
To save the British nation
From those pitfalls which Harold calls
The curse of education.
But since the sum is not to come
From us, why, spend your dollars
As suits your taste; yes, even waste
Them all upon your scholars!
[Exeunt Ministers.
First Prof. We will! And you may go
your ways,
Ye wicked old detractors!
Come, bairns, and join the song of praise
That unto thee we gladly raise,
O Prince of benefactors!
Long live the man whose noble plan
Has saved us from the chance
Of those pitfalls which Wisdom calls
The curse of ignorance.
AN UNREAL CONVERSATION.

covered, Lord Salisbury. To him
enter A. W., exactly in the manner of
W. A. in the "Pall Mall Magazine."
A. W. Good morning, my Lord. I hope
I don't disturb you.
Lord S. Not at all. I was only having
my usual doze after breakfast. But I
always wake up about this time. What
have you come for?
A. W. Oh, only for a little chat about
things in general.
Lord S. That's very nice, I 'in sure. I
shall be delighted to hear anything you
have to say.
TA. W. It's the other.way about. If you
don't mind speaking, I '11 listen.
Lord S. Oh, that's it, is it? What am
I to speak about?
A. IV. (eagerly). Well, my Lord, if you
could give me your ideas on the situa-
tion?
Lord S. The situation of this house?
As you see, it is not unpleasant. It would
not become me to praise it in remarks
intended for publication. In speeches it
is usual for the speaker to refer to his
"humble abode."
A. IV. Oh, my Lord, you could hardly
do that I When I iaid the situation, I
meant public affairs.
Lord S. Taverns, and licences, and
teetotalism, and such things? I really
don't know much about them. A friend
my mine, Joseph Chamberlain—you may
have heard of him—might give you some
information. I believe there is a large
establishment of the kind on some land
of mine in London.
A. TV. Yes, the Hotel Cecil. Talking of
that, there was a very disrespectful appli-
cation of that name to the Cabinet.
Lord S. Was there? What cabinet?
A. TV. Your Cabinet, my Lord. But I
really couldn't repeat it. As for the
Cabinet
Lord S. If you 're interested in furni-
ture, I 've got some rather nice old
cabinets in this house. The butler would
show them to you.
A. TV. You 're very kind. But, as I was
saying, as for the Cabinet and that idea of
Bowles' •
Lord S. Ah, now you come to playing at
bowls, I must confess I never cared for it.
A nephew of mine, Arthur BalfoUr—you
may have heard of him—is rather keen on
games, and might give you some informa-
tion. If I ever went to see a game I
should fall asleep directly. The only
thing that keeps me awake is a Brass-band
Competition, or, perhaps, a Military
Tournament.
A. TV. As you mention military affairs,
what do you think about Bull?
Lord S. Talking about a bull, did you
see the account of the one at Chelmsford
which ran upstairs to the first floor of a
house and tried to play on the piano?
A. TV. {with concealed impatience). I
did. But, as I was saying, what do you
think about military matters? Have you
studied those very complicated questions
of War Office administration, and appoint-
ments to the commands of the three Army
Corps? Do you still advocate rifle clubs?
Have you thought out all these problems
at Beaulieu 1 (A pause.) Why, I believe
he's asleep.
Lord S. (opening his eyes). Beaulieu, did
you say? Yes, it is a nice place. So
quiet. Excuse me, what were you say-
ing? I thought I was in the House of
Lords, and you were making a speech.
A. TV. Do you still advocate rifle clubs?

Lord 8. I? 1 don't know anything about
rifles. As for clubs, I sometimes go and
have a little doze at the Carlton. It 'a
so quiet.
A. W. Then, after rifle clubs, you -were
interested in the British Constitution.
Lord S. Ah yes. On an average it's a
very good one. Of course there are
invalids in all countries, but the people of
these islands have a good constitution as
a rule. Look how they stand extremes of
climate in the colonies.
A. W. Talking of health, are you a
conscientious objector yourself, and is
Mr. Balfour one?
Lord S. Dear me, no! I never object
to anything. Nor does Arthur. Much
too much trouble.
A. W. And talking of colonies, it takes
a long time to settlo the fighting in South
Africa. When do you think it will be
finished? Probably you have abandoned
the theory that it is already over. No
doubt it is difficult to conquer what the
Times, in the leading articles, always calls
"guerrillas." One might mistake it for
"gorillas." Of course the Times means
"guerrilleros," only it doesn't know any
Spanish. (A pause.) Dash it, he's asleep
again!
Lord 8. (opening his eyes). Spanish, did
you say? You should see my Spanish
onions. The finest in the county. The
head gardener would show them to
yon.
A. W. (impatiently). Oh, thank you'!
But, as regards Spanish affairs, do you
still think the same about decaying?
Lord S. My Spanish onions aren't decay-
ing. They 're as strong as possible.
A. W. (growing desperate). I fear I weary
you, without gaining much information.
I should like to ask one more question.
"What about China?
Lord 8. Well, there are some rather
nice pieces in the other rooms. The
housekeeper would show them to you.
A. W. No, no! I meant the Chinese
Empire. I have read Pokin
Lord S. Ah, I believe mine are Nankin
Blue.
A. W. I fear I must be going.
Lord 8. Must you really? So sorry you
have to hurry away. I have quite enjoyed
our little chat. Don't forget to see the
pigs at the Home Farm as you go out.
They 're splendid. The finest in the
county. Goodbye 1 [Exit A. W.

DECLINING FORTUNES.
When first to Swish's we were sent,
Mere babes that scarce could stammer,
Our infant minds were ever bent
On Greek and Latin grammar;
And since that exercise in tense,
Life, with its pains and racks, is
One chapter long of accidence
With lots of sin and taxes.

LONELY DOWN AT DESERT FARM!

Then ho, he, to was all the go,
And though, when we had conned it,
We passed to other things, I know
Some never got beyond it.
What boots it that my classic quill
Pens essays bright and shining?
I find the editors are still
The articles declining.
If publishers I ask to con
The pick of my productions,
Their answers read like Thomson on
The negative constructions.
Mere Jacks-in-office—well I know
The vanity that eats them—
Who lightly give a verdict, though
To parse a sentence beats them.
When all is wrong and credit low,
And dismal is existence,
Then to my maiden aunt I go
And beg for some assistance;
And when she hears my piteous cry,
Although, of course, she needn't,
This relative's attracted by
Its gentle Aunty-cedent.

This bosom-friend of princes.
In fact, of those who played with Fate,
And boldly sought to boss it e'er,
No man was ever half so great
As Herbert Wellesley Rossiter.
He owned a private troupe of Peers,
And many a trick ho taught them;
He always thought in hemispheres,
And very often bought them.
Ho took a massivo sizo in bats,
His head was so Titanic;
He drank his beer and wine from vats;
His feasts were Aldermanic.
He travelled fast in special trains
■Wherever ho was able;
While other men wore Albert chains,
He much preferred a cable.
Time had a value in his eyes,
And so its course he reckon'd
By watches of a soup-plate size
That struck each separate second.
Some simple thing like "dash" or
"zounds"
He said—he found it noted:
He would have paid a million pounds
To be less widely quoted.
If ever he should chance to chaff,
Or if his looks seemed solemn,
In paragraph on paragraph
And column after column
He found it down as "Painful News,"
Or "Smiles that may console us,"
Or thus—" The Banner interviews
The Owner of Pactolus."
His team of minor poets hymned
His praise in rather puny verse:
If anything, their efforts dimmed
A man who ran the universe.
If asked to read their stuff himself,
He muttered fiercely, "Stow it!"
As great men do, he paid the pelf,
But much despised the poet.
Though other folk ho far surpassed,
He did not ask to do so:
He had no wish to grow so vast;
He simply went and grew so.
He never knew a single need;
Some men whoso day is over
Must go to grass or run to seed:—
He always lived in clover.
At last, while all men owned him great,
His very greatness bored him;
Of fame and wealth this overweight
No pleasure could afford him.
"My millions I must spend," said he;
"No more I '11 try to pile 'em."
He went and built a gallery,
And founded an asylum.
He made a little private war,
And very ill ho made it;
His army was a largo one, for
He punctually paid it.
He advertised himself as ono
Who answered begging letters;
He gave a cheque to every dun
Who troubled needy debtors.
He took a trip to Monaco,
And, though he had no mascot,
He couldn't waste enough, and so
Ho tried his luck at Ascot.
And yet he failed to tire his star,
Although the man was clever,
And, as I write, is richer far
And wretchedor than ever.

that this indispensable regimental adjunct
contains every requisite necessary to the
success of a flying expedition from a social

barely forty tons, and was a marvel of
departmental forethought. Every taste
was catered for. Wo may note a couple
of billiard tables (ono English and the
other foreign, for prisoners' amusement),
a water-roller for cricket pitches, a steam
roundabout, and boat-swings for juvenile
and female enemies, an orchestrion for
"sing-songs," a complete set of the

files of the Times for the studious, a

a Christmas-tree for children "on the

known as "ping-pong," which seemingly
enjoyed great popularity about this time.
The whole appears to have been drawn by

it suddenly disappeared, and did not return during the day

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Renaissance Types, by W. S. LILLY (T. FISHER
Unwin), has given ns a most interesting work,
■written in a thoroughly judicial spirit. Each
character is summed np ■with perfect impar-
tiality. Of the five "types," the one that above
all others must appeal to everyone, no matter
■what may be his nationality or his religion, is
Sir Thomas More, the touching story of -whose simple faith
and loyalty is here admirably given as a plain unvarnished
tale -which none can read unmoved. The calm, unostenta-
tious way in which Mr. LILLY occasionally turns aside to
give Mr. Froude a severe rap over the knuckles and some-
times "one for his nob"—well deserved in every instance-
serves as a light diversion to the reader from the more serious
matter in hand. His Michael Angelo is picturesque without
sacrificing truth to effect; "while Mr. Lilly on LUTHER re-
minds me," quoth tho Baron, "of that 'honest chronicler,'
Griffith, pronouncing his epitaph on Cardinal WOL8EY."
Cavalier and Puritan (Smith Elder) presents an interesting
page of history compiled from the private papers and diary of
Sir Richard Newdioate. It is supplemented by extracts from
MS. news-letters addressed to him from London between
the years 1675 and 1689. There is nothing new under the
sun, not even the ubiquitous London Correspondent. My
Baronite finds the progenitor of the artist of to-day sitting
down in his favourite coffee-house, in the latter half of
the seventeenth century, inditing his weekly or fortnightly
letter. These were not published in the provincial press
for the reason that, like the Spanish Fleet on a critical
occasion, "it was not yet in sight." The subscribers were
country gentlemen desirous of being kept informed how the
world wagged in the great Metropolis, and ready to pay for
the luxury at the rate of 25s. a quarter. The extracts made
by Lady Newdigate-Newdegate are profoundly interesting, by
simplest touches lifting the veil from social life in England when
Charles the Second was king. Drinking, duelling, varied by
the diversion of assassination, were the principal occupations of
the gentlemen of England. Here is a specimen of tho news
of the day and of the severely unadorned style of the London
Correspondent in 1675 :—"A gentleman this evening was brought
by a coach to the Castle Tavern door, in Fleet Street, who,
going into the house before he had satisfied the coachman, he
called on the gentleman for his money, who, instead thereof,
killed him, and is committed to prison." The nominatives are
a little mixed. But the " instead thereof " rivals the famous
"instead of which, you go about the country stealing ducks"
of the English judge. The fascinating volume is enriched by
an engraving of a portrait of Sir Richard, painted by Sir Peter
Lely. From a letter cited, it appears that Sir Peter's price
for such work was £40. But then " beofe is now at the dearest;
one with another it is three pence halfepeny a pound."
Who among the Baron's friends will not be grateful to him
for telling them where they will be certain to enjoy a hearty
laugh? So not to keep them in suspense, the Baron hastens to
assure them that they cannot do better than become the happy
possessors of Light Freights, by W. W. JACOBS (Methuen & Co.),
which is a "jolly companion volume" to the same amusing
author's inimitable Many Cargoes. No one equals, much less
surpasses, Mr. JACOBS in this line of business, which he has
made peculiarly his own. If the Baron has previously come
across some of them, he is only too delighted to renew their
acquaintance in such excellent company. It is one of the
most laughter-moving books the Baron has come across since
he read the same author's Sea Urchins and afore-mentioned
Many Cargoes. The only grim intruder into this merry company
is " Jerry Bundler," a story that might have been omitted with
advantage.
For a well-told and oxciting story, which can be picked up
and read within the limits of a wet day, or on the night of a
fine one, A Social Pretender, by Winifred Graham (John Long),
can be recommended by my Juniorest Baronitess. The interest
is, on the whole, well sustained, in spite of the story being rather
spun out.
Mexico as I Saw It (Hurst and Blackett) is the title of the
record of Mrs. Alec Tweedd3's latest jaunt. She "saw it"
under exceedingly favourable circumstances. Armed with an
introduction to the President, she was welcomed with more
than Mexican warmth. Not content with offering the hospitality
of the Presidential residence, the President communicated with
the authorities on the traveller's route up country, with the
result that she was received with almost regal honours.
Naturally, she has a high opinion of the President, whom she
hails as "the greatest man of the nineteenth century." A
born traveller, ready, when occasion compelled, to put up with
hardships and short commons, Mrs. Tweedie took cheerfully to
the private cars provided for her on the railways, to tho semi-
official banquets, and to life in palaces. She travelled all over
Mexico, as usual with her eyes wide open. Her pictures of
home life and street life are made more vivid by a collection of
admirable photographs taken on the spot. Travellers who may
not have Mrs. Tweedie'S exceptional advantages will be com-
forted to learn that the best written chapter in the book is the
second, giving an account of life on a Mexican ranch. That
was written on the threshold of the journey, before discovery
was made of the supremacy of President Diaz.
Barbara West, by Keighley Snowdon (John Long), would be
a pathetic story were not the heroine, Barbara, a poor creature
obviously responsible for her own misfortunes. Her redeeming
quality is her generous disposition. My Juniorest Baronitess
can see neither point nor moral in this novel, which, after all,
is of a rather commonplace character.
An Occasional Critic in the employment of the Baron asks
permission to say that he has read T/ie Glowworm, by May
Bateman (William Heinemann), with a great deal of pleasure.
Here and there a little mystical and not quite so luminous as
its title would suggest. But on the whole, a clever, well-
written story. The Occasional Critic humbly adds his meed
of praise. Miss May Bateman will do better work in the future.
For the moment, however, her present is open to some criticism
—but not much.
Not a few burlesque imitations of George Meredith, the
Great Involvolist's peculiar style, have from time to time
appeared,—and to note this fact is to pay an unmistakable
tribute to the ever-increasing popularity of this masterful
novelist,—but the Baron can only recall a passage in one of
them so perfect as is Mr. R. C. Lehmann's brief and most
absurdly nonsensical "per-version," entitled Lord Ormont's
Mate, which, with The Adventures of Picklock Holes (from Punch)
and The Pink Hippopotamus, now appears in one volume,
published by Messrs. Bradbury, Agnew & Co. The book is
humorously illustrated by the much daring E. T. Reed, and the
carefully comic E. J. Wheeler. The Baron de B.-W.
P.S.—Somestudiouslittle bookworm will be fascinated with T7ie
Reign of King Cole (J. M. Dent & Co.), edited by J. M. GIBBON;
containing as it does "the true annals of Fairy-
land." To the much-discussed Fiddlers Three is
credited the singing or relating of these tales at ye
court of the merriest monarch of ancient renown.
This erudite collection possesses the charm of
finding old friends bound together anew in the
happiest style. There are delightful pictures in
nearly every page by Charles Robinson.

THOMPSON ON "TINNED COW."
II.
Myself, though I despise all girls, I never hated one worse than
this. The least a girl can be at any time is harmless ; but Milly
Dunstan -was brimful of trickery, and, just because her eyes
were accidentally blue, thought she could score oft everybody
and everything. Not that she ever scored off me. She knew
that I barred her altogether, and scorned me in consequence,
and called me " Master THOMPSON " to make me waxy, me being
only about four months younger than her.
She got his mother's pet name for him out of "Tinned Cow,"
and called him by it in secret. Not that I over heard it, or
wanted to. And she also gave out that anybody calling him
"Tinned Cow " any more would be her enemy ; and one or two
chaps were feeble enough actually to stop.
Milly Dunstan wrecked his character. Before, he'd been as
keen as knives about sport and so on, and there is no doubt
that he would have got into the second footer team next term if
Gregson Minor had passed his exam, for the " Britannia." But
Milly Dunstan didn't care a straw about footer, though she
understood cricket fairly well for a girl; and so " Tinned Cow,"
like a fool, gave up all hope of getting on at footer, at which he
promised to be some use, and went in like mad for cricket, at
which he never could be any earthly good whatever. And that
made another row, because Milly promised to walk twice round
old Dunstan's private garden with Street, the captain of the
third eleven (cricket), if he'd give " Tinned Cow " a trial in an
unimportant match; and STREET said,'' Right.'' And they went,
during prep., and it happened that the Doctor, coming out of
his greenhouse, caught them; and STREET got five hundred
lines ; which naturally made him in such a bate, thinking it was
a trap, that he refused to try " Tinned Cow" for ever.
I'm sure I did all I could, for, though I'd lost any feeling for
him since he let this girl sit on him, still I was his chum once.
And I tried to save him, and asked him, many a time and oft, why
he let his life be spoilt by a skimpy girl. And he said that it
was her skimpiness he liked, for she put him in mind of his
sister—only his sister was smaller, and, of course, had squashed
feet. To see a girl who can walk about seems to be a great
treat to the Chinese ; so what for they let theirs all squash their
feet, Heaven only knows.
"Tinned Cow" confessed to me that MILLY Dunstan was
pretty sharp, and had been reading up all about China in one of
the Doctor's books. In fact, he confessed also that she knew a
lot more about China in general than he did. And some things
she liked, and some she didn't; and especially the marriage
customs she didn't like ; and she told "Tinned Cow" that un-
less ho let her father marry them in a proper Christian church,
it was off. So he promised : and he also promised, though very
reluctantly, not to say a word about it to Doctor Dunstan until
he got to be head of the Sixth and the School. But he knew
that at the rate he was going, he would never get there till he
was at least fifty years old. And sons of Mandarins marry very
early indeed iD their own country—as soon as they like, in fact
—so "Tinned Cow" promised reluctantly. Then ho took to
working and swatting; yet all his swatting only got him into
the lower Fourth in three terms. Then, seeing what a lot it
meant getting into the Sixth, and what a frightful thing it was,
especially for a foreigner, to do it, "Tinned Cow" fell back
upon the customs of his country; and his methods of cribbing
were certainly fine and new. But they couldn't do everything,
and he tried still other Chinese customs in an arithmetic exam,
and attempted to bribe old Thwaites with two weeks' pocket
money—a pound, in fact—if he would arrange to let him got
enough marks to go up a form. Of course, everybody knew old
Thwaites had a wife and about ten children at Merivale and,
though a Sixteenth Wrangler in olden times, was at present
frightfully hard up in secret. But what is a paltry pound to a
Sixteenth 'Wrangler? Anyway Thwaites raged with great
fierceness and took "Tinned Cow" to the Doctor; and as the
Doctor hates strategy of this kind, he made it hot for "Tinned
Cow " and flogged him pretty badly. I asked if it hurt, being
the first time the Doctor had ever flogged him, and ho said the
only thing that hurt was the horrid feeling that he'd offered
too little to THWArrES. He said that in his country, and
especially among Mandarins, offering too little was almost as
great a crime as offering too much, and that he deserved to
be flogged on the feet as well as elsewhere. He said that his
father was such a good judge of people that he always offered
just the right sum; and he felt certain that in the case of
THWAITES not a penny less than ten pounds ought to have been
offered. It was the known hard-uppishness of Thwaites that
made him think a pound would do; but now, seeing what a little
way money seemed to go with a man, he felt about the only
chap within reach of being bribed was the drill sergeant; and
of course he couldn't help "Tinned Cow" to get into the
Sixth. Besides, the drill sergeant had fought in China in his
young days, and he had a sort of war-like repugnance against
"Tinned Cow" that would have taken at least gold to get
over.
So things went on until the arrival of the sweets from China;
and they were all right, though "Tinned Cow" told me that she
wasn't as keen about them as he expected, or at any rate
pretended not to be. The truth is that some of the very
swaggerest Chinese sweets take nearly a lifetime thoroughly
to like; and by the time that Milly began to feel the remark-
able beauty of this sort, she'd finished them. However, she
was fairly just—for her, and didn't throw the beggar over
before the taste of the last sweet was out of her mouth, as you
might have expected. In fact, she kept friendly for a matter of
several weeks; and then she began to get rather sick of his
Chinese ways—so she said—and cool off towards him, even
though in his despair he promised her idols and fireworks and
many things that probably wouldn't have been sent even if
he'd written home for them.
But Chinese chaps have quite different ideas to English chaps,
owing to their bringing-up, and things we utterly bar and
consider caddish, such as sneaking, a Chinese chap will do
freely without the least idea he is making a beast of himself.
I didn't know this, or else I should never have allowed "Tinned
Cow" to be my chum, but at last I discovered the fatal truth;
and the worst of it was that he sneaked against a bitter enemy
of mine, called Forrester, thinking that ho was doing a right
and proper thing towards me.
This chap Forrester I hated for many reasons, but chiefly
because he'd beaten me, by about ten marks only, in a Scripture
exam, owing to knowing the names of the father and mother of
Moses, which are not generally known. I always had a fixed
idea, funnily enough, that Moses was the son ^of Pharaoh's
daughter ; and I said so, and I added, as a shot—for shots often
come off, though they are dangerous—that Holy Writ was silent
concerning the father of Moses. And the Doctor hates a shot
that misses, frightfully, so I had to write out the whole business
of Moses fifty times, till I was sick of the very name of him;
whereas Forrester won the prize. Well, this Forrester kept
sardines in his desk and ate them during Monsieur Michel's
class. Bat some, already opened, he forgot for several weeks.
And these—being doubtful of them when he found them again—
he gave to MILLY Dunstan's Persian kitten ; and "Tinned Cow"
saw him. Well, the kitten showed that Forrester was quite
right to be doubtful about the sardines by dying. It disappeared
from that very hour, and was believed to have gone next door to
die, as cats are generally very unwilling to die in their own
homes, and always go next door to do so, curious to say. And
MILLY was in an awful bate when "Tinned Cow" told her,
thinking it would please me; whereas, if anything could have
made me get friends with Forrester it would hav» been to
knowihe'd scored off Milly Dunstan. But her rage against

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
Forrester was pretty frightful—especially, she said, because a any shuffling of feet had occurred. The smell of hot rashers,
boy whose strong point was Scripture could have done this j the frizzling of eggs and the bubbling of coffee convinced me
thing ; and she made " Tinned Cow" tell the Doctor; and such
was his piffling weakness where she was concerned, that he did.
But old Dunstan, who hated cats, said it was a case of circum-
stantial evidence!—whatever that is—and the proofs of the cat's
death were too slight, seeing the body couldn't be found, and re-
membering a cat's power of eating sardines, even when a bit off.
Then he turned against "Tinned Cow," and told him that the
that this outspoken man was correct in his definition of the
atmosphere, which, I am constrained to say, has never changed
since that memorable morning, judging by sounds with which I
have never ventured to make nearer acquaintance. But it has
been impossible for me not to note that the chances of certain
race horses (when tho artists are wandering about my little
pleasaunce) afford them infinite interest, and I should be lack-
character of an informer ill became any pupil of Dunstan's, and | ing in courtesy to the brewer who supplies me with ale if I did
not state that someone other
that to try and undo a fellow-
student might be Oriental but
was not English, and so on—all
in words that you can find in
Dictionaries, but nowhere else
that I ever heard of.
Which showed the Doctor
wasn't so keen about "Tinned
Cow" as ho used to be, and
that was chiefly because
"Tinned Cow's" younger
brother was not coming to be
educated in England after all,
as Doctor Dunstan had hoped,
but was going to Germany
instead. E. P.

THE ARTIST UP TO DATE.
Dear Mr. Punch,—I am not
alluding to a Royal Acade-
mician, or even to a talented
scene painter, such as Mr.
Fred Storey or Mr. Banks,
by the above heading, but to
the common or garden limner
—tho latter is a very fitting
term, for reasons which I shall
now, with your permission, pro-
ceed to show, in the fervent
hope that you, Sir, may help
me to get hold of an automatic
or mechanical layer-on of pig-
ment.
It happened a short time
ago that tho little house which

I occupy with my wife
family required, under my
lease, an exterior redceoration.
I accordingly summoned to my
assistance the firm of Messrs.
MAHL and Sons. Five eminent
gentlemen appeared on the fol-
lowing morning at the hour of
six. They conversed in the tone of voice which distinguishes
the melodrama of commerce, and, in so far as I can judge,
without laying myself open to an action for libel, breakfasted
off the plums and apples in my orchard.
At 8.30, however, my spouse, a nervous woman with a heart
like an indifferent telephone, requested me somewhat imperi- .
ously to look into tho kitchen and ascertain the reason of
certain shouts of laughter, not unaccompanied with the rattling New Leoal Appointments.—Who are the unfortunate persons
of boots, proceeding from the spot of culinary culture. The whose names are " in the Black Books" of Lincoln's Inn? Let
guild of five artists, when I entered the kitchen, were engaged, them hasten to secure the good offices of Sir Edward Clarke,
together with the cook, housemaid and nurse, in a dance not who has recently been appointed " Keeper of the Black Books"

condition of the feet of himself and his worthy associates that "Master of the Walks."
than myself did not appreciate
tho quality of his malt and
hops.
When the probable and possi-
ble winners of tho races of the
day have been discussed and de-
cided, the burst of minstrelsy
is unanimous among the festive
five, but it is not always har-
monious. Two of the limners
whistle through their teeth,
two others sing selections from
the Emerald Isle, and the fifth
—I think he must bo the fore-
man—has a distant conception
of the Conspirators' Chorusfrom
La Fille de Madame Amjot.
I should not complain of the
conduct of my pictorial bene-
factors were it not that they
will not go, for the excellent
reason that they do not com-
plete their labour. The red-
headed foreman has a knack of
assembling his four bandit-
companions after they lay on
a thin coat of evil-smelling
material over a shutter, and
saying, " Well, boys, how does
that look? Give me your
opinion." They always do.
It means a return to the
kitchen and the beer barrel.
You may, perhaps, have re-
marked that I have no male
servant. But since this reno-
vation, tho disappearance of
my tobacco has been phenome-
nal. I think that the gentler
sex, when in service, is often
too generous. Meantime, what
am I to do? I can only ask
you, Sir, to find the mechanical
medium for having a cottage
repainted. Will you think this out with Professor Edison or
Sir H. Maxim? and greatly oblige,
Your distressed Servant, OLIVER Kandel.

Oh! could -we only sco
From thine the interest so sweet
That ours do take in thee!
O man of steel, bo wax to-day!
On thee our hopes are built;
Come, join our company, we pray;
Promote ns as thou wilt.
No check that thou canst give will make
Thy wooers draw the line;
Medicine itself will gladly take
A little draught of thine.
Alroady, Sir, thou art enrolled
Among our LL.D.'s,
And therefore do our hopes grow bold
To win thee by degrees.
The cap is waiting for thy brow,
The robe is ready here—
O peerless in investments thou,
In vestments now appear!
A MATTER OP SENTIMENT.
A. and B. meet face to face in St. Martin's
Lane.
A. My friend, you look very weary.
B. Yes, I am weary indeed.
A. What is the cause of the deep melan-
choly that seems to overwhelm you?
B. I have been doing a theatre with a
new piece. I am perplexed and fatigued.
A. Ah, then you have seen The Senti-
mentalist at the Duke of York's?
B. I have. It was hard to bear. Very
hard indeed when the two heroes — one
middle-aged, the other juvenile—told of
their early unsatisfactory lives to heroine
No. 2.
A. But surely heroine No. 2 was greatly
shocked?
B. She could not have been. For ac-
cording to her own account she had read
books—ahem—not usually obtainable at
Smith's or Mudie's.
A. And did not she accept a satyr Duke
in revenge?
B. Yes—yes—yes! A sad story. But
it was redeemed by the capital murder of
the satyr Duke by that most excellent of
players, Mr. Lewis Waller.
A. You say it was a good murder?
B. A very good one indeed. Something
in scratches, with a poisoned dagger
thrown in. A most excellent murder.
The victim died with a cigar in his mouth
in great agony. Most effective.
A. And did not heroine No. 1 confess
to weighing thirteen stone?
B. Only in the play. In the prologuo
she was much slimmer. She looked very
young—in the prologue.
A. And Mr. Lewis Waller, did he not
look also very young—in the prologue?
B. He looked younger in tho play. In
the play he might have passed for thirty,
or even twenty-five. But he did not look
so young in the prologue.
A. Would you care to see the play
again?
B. Well, no; although it is well written.
Stay—I think I would like to see the
murder of the Duke again. It was very
effective to see him die with a cigar in his
mouth in great agony. It was not totally
unlike the death of the fellow in The Cat
and the Cherub. Yes, I would like to see
that again. I would like to see the Duke
dying in tortures with a cigar in his mouth.
A. But would you—adopting the Chinese
suggestion—like to see that sombre inci-
dent twice daily for a thousand years?
B. (after mature deliberation). No, I do
not think I would. But now I must leave
you. After the dismal play I want cheer-
ing up.
A. But where will you go to be cheered
up?
B. As I must be cheered up gradually, I
shall go—in the first instance—to the
School of Mines in Jermyn Street.
[Exeunt severally.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE YOUNG NOVELIST'S ODIDE TO
MEDICINE.
Chloroform. Invaluable to writers of
sensational stories. Every high-class
flctionary criminal carries a bottle in his
pocket. A few drops, spread on a hand-
kerchief and waved within a yard of the
hero's nose, will produce a state of com-
plete unconsciousness lasting for several
hours, within which time his pockets may
be searched at leisure. This property of
chloroform, familiar to every expert
novelist, seems to have escaped the notice
of the medical profession.
Consumption. The regulation illness
for use in tales of mawkish pathos. Very
popular some years ago, when the heroine
made farewell speeches in blank verse, and
died to slow music. Fortunately, how-
ever, the public has lost its fondness for
work of this sort. Consumption at its
last stage is easily curable (in novels) by
the re-appearance of a hero supposed to
bo dead. Two pages laterjthe heroine will
gain strength in a way which her doctors
— not unnaturally — will describe as
"perfectly marvellous." And in the next
chapter the marriage-bells will ring.
Doctor. Always include a doctor among
your characters. He is quite easy to
manage, and invariably will belong to one
of these three types: (a) The eminent
specialist. Tall, imperturbable, urbane.
Only comes incidentally into the story,
(b) Young, bustling, energetic. Not much
practice, and plenty of time to look after
other poeple's affairs. Hard-headed and
practical. Often the hero's college friend.
Should be given a pretty girl to marry
in the last chapter, (c) The old family
doctor. Benevolent, genial, wise. Wears
gold spectacles, which he has to take off
and wipe at the pathetic parts of the
book.
Fbver. A nice, useful term for flc-
tionary illnesses. It is best to avoid
mention of specific symptoms, beyond that
of "a burning brow," though, if there
are any family secrets which need to
be revealed, delirium is sure to supervene
at a later stage. Arthur Pendennis,
for instance, had fictional "fever," and
baffled doctors have endeavoured ever
since to And out what really was the
matter with him. "Brain-fever," again,
is unknown to the medical faculty, but
you may safely afflict your intellectual
hero with it. The treatment of flctionary
fever is quite simple, consisting solely
of frequent doses of grapes and cooling
drinks. These will be brought to the
sufferer by the heroine, and these simple
remedies administered in this way have
never been known to fail.
Fracture. After one of your char-
acters has come a cropper in the hunting-
field he will be taken on a hurdle to the
nearest house: usually, by a strange
coincidence, the heroine's home. And he

'What is it, Mi-mmie dear?'
"A ttPMMY, DEAR."
will be said to have sustained "a com-
pound fracture" — a vague description
which will quite satisfy your readers.
Gout. An invaluable disease to the
humorist. Remember that heroes and
heroines are entirely immune from it,
but every rich old uncle is bound to
suffer from it. The engagement of his
niece to an impecunious young gentleman
invariably coincides with a sharp attack
of gout. The humour of it all is, perhaps,
a little difficult to see, but it never fails
to tickle the public.
He art-Disease. An excellent complaint
for killing off a villain. If you wish to
pave the way for it artistically, this is
the recognised method. On page 100 he
will falter in' the middle of a sentence,
grow pale, and press his hand sharply to
his side. In a moment he will have re-
covered, and will assure his anxious
friends that it is nothing. But the reader
knows better. He has met the same pre-
monitory symptom in scores of novels,
and he will not be in the least surprised
when, on the middle of page 250, the
villain suddenly drops dead. A. C. D.

bers of the goose family.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 13, 1901.
PEGASUS ON THE WAR-PATH.
[The reader is referred to an article in the Daily
Chronicle of November 6, on "The Question of
Mobility: A Comparison of British and Boer
Methods."]
Dear Friend of Animals, I -write
To let you know my parlous plight;
Behold in me a living corse
That used to be a British horse.
You will, I'm sure, be glad to know
Just why my health has got so low;
And how unfair it is to me
To mock my immobility.
At home they kept me sleek and fat,
And stroked me like a pussy-cat;
I never had to sit up late
Or carry any dreadful weight.
They gave me, in between supplies,
A little healthy exercise,
Not more, not even on review,
Than I could comfortably do.
But here I hardly ever feel
Quite certain of a solid meal;
They make me march (this can't be right)
At any hour of day or night.
I barely have the breath to groan
Beneath my two-and-twenty stone,
Including blanket, tent, and sack
Of ornamental bric-it-brac.
Sometimes, to give the mules a change,
I wear a model kitchen-range,
And count it lucky not to find
A grand piano up behind.
We trek a dozen miles or so
Till dawn reveals the sleeping foe;
Then halt in line, and mustn't stir,
But wait for something to occur.
My rider sits me like a rock
From five to eight (or nine) o'clock;
The rules forbid his'getting off
To ease my flanks and let me cough.
My withers wrung, my belly void,
Each minute makes me more annoyed,
Until at last he leaps to earth
Only to tighten up my girth.
After a quiet time in bed
The Boers, by this, have breakfasted;
The same is true of all their gees,
Which makes them feel as fit as fleas.
Refreshed by slumber, grass and meat,
They bustle off in full retreat;
And when they 've gone a league or two
We are invited to pursue.
The regulations don't allow
That we should reason why or how;
And so we lurch along their track
With awful aches about the back.
At times I sink my patriot pride
And wish I were the other side;
From all I hear, in point of feed
They do you very well indeed. 1
Besides, they have a pretty touch,
And never load you overmuch;
The biltong's weight is very small,
And really hardly counts at all.
They ride, in fact, at fourteen nett,
And every man is born a vet.;
Some captured ponies whom I know
Distinctly said that this was so.
They ride at large with loosish rein
Which saves the neck from needless pain,
And lets you see the shocking pits
That break our prancers' legs to bits.
A moment's halt behind a kop—
Saddles are off and bridles drop;
And there you browse in perfect ease,
Or sit and smile just where you please.
No doubt, a Dutchman can't afford
Virtues that are their own reward,
But he has learned some little ways
Of showing kindness where it pays.
With us—the boast is often made—
We fight as if upon parade:
From certain silly points of view
This is, unfortunately, true.
Indeed, I heard a foreign blood
(Attached, I think, to Reuter's stud)
Remark with supercilious air:—
"C'est magni flque, mais pas la guerre!"
For we are not by any means
Identical with mere machines;
And even they are apt to spoil
For want of proper care and oil.
Dear Mr. Punch, two years are gone,
And still the war goes footling on,
And well it may, till people glean
Some homely truths outside routine.
It's widely known by now that horses
Are useful aids to mounted forces,
And somebody some day will prove
That mobile troops are meant to move!
O. S.
CHANGE AT THE END OF THE
CENTURY.
(From the T-m-s of 1990.)
TO THE EDITOR.
Sir, — As the twentieth century has
reached its last decade, I think it's only
right to protest in the names, not only of
the inhabitants of Greater London—which
include the residents at Windsor, Chat-
ham and Maidenhead—but of that even
larger multitude, the rest of the civilised
world, against the ruthless hand of the
Philistine. Rapidly sites hallowed by
memories of the past are being put to
purposes that rob them of every trace of
romance. On the plea that " they are being
turned to better account," some of our
most cherished possessions are being
swept away. I jot down a few chosen at
random.
The Exterior of South Kensington
Station.—It is proposed to re-erect this
interesting building in stone! What can
be more quaint than the low elevation,
with its suggestions of zino roofing and
dimly-lighted wooden platforms? What
would our ancestors have thought of such
a desecrat ion? Our ancestors who re-
garded it as the starting-point to and the
returning-point from their labours in the
City! Why, it is more than a century old!
Surely its antiquity should protect it!
The Griffin of Temple Bar. — And this
is threatened! It is said that it impedes
the traffic between the Strand and Fleet
Street! A cry reaching back to the
Georgian Era! When this splendid work
of art was erected, more than a century
ago, it was claimed for it that it was the
finest product of the sculptor's studio in
London. And to-day it retains its title
unchallenged.
The Clock at the end of Victoria Street
and the commencement of the Vauxhall
Bridge Road.—It is proposed to make it
double its height! What can be more
absurd! When it was erected it was
said to be an excellent foil to the Clock
Tower of the Houses of Parliament and
the timepiece belonging to Westminster
Abbey. And now it serves the same pur-
pose to the black walls (said once to have
been bright red brick) of the venerable
Westminster Cathedral in once-quite-
fashionable Ashley Place. Why remove
our ancient land-marks?
But there, I am tired of continuing the
list! Electric trams have invaded every
pleasant countrified spot. They are spoil-
ing Upham Park Road in the effort to get
to Bedford Park, and, it is said, oven
purpose running round the entire length
of Red Lion Square! Where will it all stop?
Are our tenderest feelings to be outraged
in this fashion for ever? I hope not.
Yours indignantly, >
Smythe de Joynes.
Victoria House,
Croydon Common East,
South Kensington.
AN EXPOSTULATION.
[A Kelmscott Press Chaucer was recently sold
at auction for £510.]
YOUR very pen must blush with shame
A cheque for such a sum to draw, Sir;
The wicked waste deserves our blame.
Five hundred guineas for a Chaucer!
Necessity you cannot plead,
Charged withextravaganceou this count;
One every bit as good to read
You'd get for three-and-sixlessdiscount.
In times like these, when money's tight,
And when Consols are daily falling
And taxes rising, is it right—
A waste so wanton and appalling?
But surely this will make you rue
Your outlay wildly injudicious:
Consider, for the money you
Might buy two '47 Mauritius.

JUSTIFIABLE SLANG.
London. November 4th, 5th, and 6th.
"Bit thick, ain't it!"
LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. V.—Homer Theophilus Renton.
Greatness! What is it? To be born a Prince,
To pule in purple swaddling clothes and chew
With toothless gums a natal silver spoon,
Is nothing: any self-respecting babe,
If but his fate shook out the glittering chance,
.Could do it, so to speak, upon his head.
How oft, unless our novelists have erred,
The babes of humble ploughmen have been changed
At birth for babes of lordly parents born.
The little changelings looked so much the same,
The high-born and the lowly: both had heads,
Legs, arms, and all that may pertain thereto.
Both had been dipped, it would appear, in port,
And had retained the colour of the wine.
Both closed their lists and in their leisure time
Sparred a brisk round or two with unseen foes.
Both yelled, and took their nourishment with zest,
Had blobs for noses, little beads for eyes,
Bats' wings for ears, and both were formed to be
The fond delight of grandmammas and aunts.
In fact there was no difference, and they grew
Without a murmur to their changed estates.
Giles was a Viscount, but he scared the birds,
Herded the sheep, or drove a team a-fleld.
The Viscount Montgrlas, his true name Giles,
Was swished at Eton, went to Trin. Coll. Cam.,
And, later, drove his team to Hurlingham.
He took his swishings like the lord he wasn't,
Became a blood at Cambridge, and was famed
As polo-player, hunting man and shot.
His talents in the House of Lords were such
That he was made an under secretary;
And men remembered his great grandfather,
And hailed him very chip o' the ancient block,—
What time poor Giles, the true-born chip of chips,
Within whose veins the blood of many peers
Blended and ran, was ploughing steadily,
And sowing seed, and bringing up a brood
Of lusty children in his cottage home.
Then came the crash—a foster-mother spoke,
Pricked by her conscience, and revealed the fraud.
And then—but, bah! I'm straying from my task:
I only meant to show that men may be.
If a rash foster-mother should misguide
Their destinies, far greater than themselves
Without so much as lifting up a hand.
These rouse no admiration in my mind,
Although I envy them their wealth and rank,
The gold-topped fittings of their dressing-bags,
Their rent-rolls and their horses and their lands,
And all their store of studs and links and pins,
Their valets and their footmen and their coats,
Their fancy-patterned waistcoats and their ties,
And the meek deference of men they meet;
And, above all, the gay, the reckless ease
With which they put a penny in each slot
At railway stations on bank-holidays.
Oft have I seen them, caring not a whit
Though the false dial should declare their weight
As eighteen stone and then should make it ten,
Or even if the coin that should have drawn
A pure fruit tablet from its coy recess
Produced a box of matches to their grasp.
Yet I admire them not, but I admire
Men who achieve their greatness for themselves :—
Of these was Renton, Homer T., the bard.
Poets are made : their wildly rolling eye,
Their bair, the poses which they use to bore us,
Are art's, not nature's, and they give the lie
To what was idly said by ancient FLORUS.
If metric fame from early youth they 're bent on,
They make themselves : this was the case with Renton.
A Rector I have seen in early days:
He wished for things, but, having sent his wish up,
He worked with might and main to win such praise
As might entitle him to be a Bishop,
Until he realised his youthful dreaming,
And blossomed out, lawn-sleeved and bland and beaming.
Jobbers who haunt the Stock Exchange are prone
To raise their voice—they do not often spare it.
From some exalted perch they shout alone;
This is the way in which they millionaire it.
They end, although their manners are not courtly,
Park-Laned and shooting-boxed and very portly.
And I have watched a barrister apply,
His subtlo mind to many a complex problem.
The fees were great and his ambitions high;
He knew solicitors and how to nobble 'em.
And while his arguments the Court were shaking,
I felt I saw a Law Lord in the making.
All these I knew; but never till I met
Homer T. Renton had I watched a poet,
Or seen him keep his plant of metre wet
With studious water that might help to grow it.
He was, in fact, a most industrious climber
Up fame's high hill, this manufactured rhymer.

I carry it with me where I go,
For when you may want it you never know—
The fact is, I'm also a Galtonite,
And into Class X I passed all right
With honours in ample measure!

Very well, here 'a mine with pleasure!

NOT NOVEL.
[The reading public . . . in rtill eagerly devour-
ing the threadbare Russian 'Nihilist novel.'"—
Daily Press.
"ON THE STEPPES."
A Nihilistic Novel.
Hurrying down the Nevski Prospect,
clad in heavy sables, went IVAN Black-
browski. Snow was falling: Droski
drivers were urging along their steeds—
always three abreast, always at full
gallop, always threatened with thedriver's
upraised whip (unless the pictures are
hopelessly wrong): the sleigh bells made
mournful music for the mujik—they are
all mujikal in Russia.
At the corner house—a Pubski—Ivan
Black browski suddenly paused, and
turned abruptly in.
But he was not unobserved, and when,
an hour later, he emerged, somewhat
sqniffski, from vodka, a dark figure fol-
lowed him on hands and knees, through
the deep snow. It was that of an Agent
of the Third Section—Alexis Rtjniminski
—an Extra Special constable. Wearing a
false nose and whiskers, he knew that he
would not be recognised, and therefore
kept close to his quarry. Runiminski was
the most celebrated living "Agent of
Secret Service" (A.S.S.), and well had he
deserved that proud title.
Ivan Blackbrowski had never been an
upright man; under the influence of
eleven split vodki, he was less so now
than ever; but he, nevertheless, made
rapid progress as he crossed the bridge
over the Neva, though he had neva—beg
pardon, never — been that way before.
The Police Agent kept up with difficulty,
by reason of proceeding on hands and
knees. "Not a knees-y task! " he mut-
tered, grimly. But soon his patience was
rewarded; for Blackbrowski stopped at
a house opposite the fortress of St.
Peter and St. Paul (must drag this in,
somehow). Here he paused, irresolute—
but a deftly aimed snowball alighting
in his left ear, coupled with the ribald
laughter of the smorlkadki who had
thrown it, decided him. "I will go on
to the Steppes," he murmured. He gave
one rap with the knocker, the door
opened as though by magic, and the
conspirator disappeared within.
The Police Agent smiled grimly.
"He is mine—Siberian mine—for now
I know the secret signal. I have cap-
tured the knock I"
He grasped his revolver and commenced
the ascent of the Steppes. At the ■ top,
he seized the knocker and gave a clever
imitation of Ivan's summons. Then he
turned away and stared up at the grisly
fortress opposite.
With equal celerity the door was again
opened, and a heavily shod foot came into
such violent contact with the rear eleva-
tion of the Police Agent, that the latter
was shot sharply down the Steppes, and
measured his length upon the snow-white
mantlet covering the earth.
The emissary of the Third Section
slowly rose and rubbed himself with deep
thought and a fur-lined glove.
'' Foiled!" he muttered, darkly. '' Clear-
ly, when a man walks into a house, in
Russia—or at all events, in a "Russian"
novel—there must be danger to the "White
Tsar." (N.B.—For the benefit of the un-
initiated, we may mention that there are
no black or coloured Tsars about.) "I
will at once inform Prince Orfultoff at
the Crys—the Winter Palace."
Prince SERGIUS ORFULTOFP was of the
bluest blood in Russia: "Blue Sergius"
was his sobriquet. He was very near the
Throne (especially when riding a restive
horse): he was rich and powerful. He
looked from a window of his castle, and
said: "As far as eye can reach, all this is
mine." It was a lie^ but, still, it afforded
him a cheap form of entertainment, and he
often indulged himself thus.
Equerry and Grand-Hereditary Trousers-
Stretcher to the Tsar, he was proud as
Lucifer—for whom he was quite a match.
Revelling in the gorgeous silken
cushions on which he reclined, and- a
twopenny manilla, held lovingly between
his white bejewelled fingers, Prince
Orfultoff was languidly conversing with
the Court physician, Dr. Kurakoff.
"A slump in Nihilism, eh, mon Prince?"
asked the latter.
"Yes. This week we have only had
three attempts on the Tsar's life. I fear
he is beginning to miss the daily excite-
ment."
A tap on the door was followed by the
appearance of a Secretary.
"Another plot? " asked " Blue Sergius"
wearily, as he stuck a second, and then
a third " twopenny" between his pearly
teeth. He lit the cigars with a match
drawn from a diamond-covered box, and
then said—
"Where are the Police?"
"The Chief Bobbikoff now stands upon
the Kurdish doormat, awaiting your
pleasure."
Turning to Kurakoff, the Equerry
briefly said—
"Get out." And the Doctor went,
hurriedly.
The Chief of the Third Section entered,
and struck an attitude.
"I have discovered a plot"
"Building plot?" queried Orfultoff,
cynically, and pulling lightly at his three
cigars.
"a plot to assassinate the White
Tsar!!!"
'' That all ? Couldn't you start something
more original?" asked the Prince, lan-
guidly.
"Runiminski has followed a notorious
Anarchist—at least, we (the Police) don't
know anything of him, so we conclude that
he is a notorious Anarchist—to a meeting-
place. 'He traced his little footsteps in
the snow,' " quoted the Bobbikoff, who was
poetical, and sometimes made a few versts
himself. He reeked of vodka, and the
Prince drew back shudderingly—this was
a man who always made his presence
smelt—felt, we mean.
Then " Blue SERGIUS " aroused himself;
"Arrest everybody you happen to see.
Lodge them all in the fortress—torture
them on Tuesdays and Fridays—have them
whipped—your executioner is 'a thing
of knout.' And afterwards we will send
them to Siberia. Stay—perhaps we had
better try them first. Bring the bombs
into Court, and"
"But there are no bombs."
"Get some, then. Stuff some incrimi-
nating papers into their pockets. Say
they are Polish—probably their speech
will be un-polished if they come from the
Volga—they are all very Volga there.
And now, away! Report to mo at the
Palace, where 1 shall lie playing half-
penny nap with the Romanoffs."
And the Bobbikoff awayed.
A month later, included in the chain-
gangs wearily tramping the Great Siberian
road to Tomkatz, were Blackbrowski and
six others captured with him. These
seven were a limited company, of whom
one Demetrius Dividendski was the
chairman. This man, together with Sacha
j Kaskowhiski—a very ardent spirit—and
the beauteous Princess Oloa Sossidge-
SKIN, formed a daring plan of escape.
One night, soon after arriving at a dreary
post-house, the Chairman rose and said:
"Gentlemen "when the report of a
pistol interrupted him. "We will take
the report as read," added- Demetrius
pleasantly. "Gentlemen, should you per-
severe in dragging us to the mines we
shall at once take possession of them in
the name of the company, and issue to
you shares (with unlimited liability). Your
sole escape from that is to release us—
you r prisoners—at once. What say you ?''
He looked round, but the captives were
alone—their guards had fled into the night
at the Chairman's threat.
The unhappy prisoners were free. Joy-
fully they broke into the Russian National
Anthem—broke into it so severely, that
it was hopelessly shattered. They had
escaped "the stepper," and were "On
the Steppes."

HUMAN COALFIELDS.
Dear Me. Punch,—A clever statisti-
cian has stated that the volume of car-
bonic acid exhaled by a healthy person
in twenty-four hours is about 15,000 cubic
inches, containing about six ounces of
solid carbon. This is at the rate of 137
pounds avoirdupois annually. Averaging
the human race at a thousand millions,
the scientist calculates that they breathe
out every year sixty-one million tons of
solid carbon, or nearly twice as much
as the total export of coal from Great
Britain.
I write to you, Sir, as the most profound
thinker and most enlightened chemist of
the day, to know whether you cannot
invent a little apparatus to be fitted over
the mouth of every human being, thus
converting him or her into a personal
coal-scuttle? Think of the saving to the
pocket of the householder in winter when
each member of his family shakes the
quantum of carbon into the grate!
And then, how would it not affect the
question of marriage? Two healthy young
"carbonisers "—title registered — would
bo much more likely to do well in the
world than a couple of sickly individuals
who could not produce enough coal to
boil the kettle for breakfast.
Then again, on engaging a servant, the
first question put by the mistress of the
house would be, "How much carbon did
you produce a day in your last situa-
tion?"
The despair of Lord LONDONDERRY and
other pit-owners would doubtless be very
great, but the advantage to the human
race would be enormous. For instance,
orators might make their own gas and
locomotive drivers stoke their own en-
gines. As to the limited companies
which could be floated on the scheme,
the prospect of these undertakings opens
up vistas of, at least, sixty-one million
tons of gold—instead of carbon. Do, Sir,
put your powerful brain to work and
construct the apparatus which I venture
to suggest.

cesses used when they spoke to drop pearls

I met an ancient in the Strand,
An exile long was he
Abroad far from his native land
In lands beyond the sea.
He marvelled much at what he saw
On every side, and said:
"Does London feed her greedy maw
With loaves of Strand-grown bread?
For here I see the furrows made,
No doubt by some steam plough;
The floors for threshing-floors aro laid,
The seed is sown ere now.
"Instead of roads of dirty brown
We shall have fields of corn;
The harvest home of London town
The country put to scorn.
O great and noble thought to bring
The farmer to the Strand:

A great and noble band."
1 undeceived that ancient man,
The upturned soil reviled;
He left me saddened, weird, and wan,
With all his hopes defiled.

Made corns alone for weary feet.

DOMESTIC ECONOMIES.
Miss Snippet.
Gwendolen was resolved to
lose no time in setting to work.
"Your study table is the
best place in the house,
Jack"
"Then I may as well cycle
over to"
"Jack!"
The reproach in Gwendolen's
tone was a slap in the face
to me. I had been rather con-
gratulating myself on the good
grace with which I agreed to
forsake my tragedy for the
morning, and here was Gwen-
dolen looking at me as if I
were the most heartless of
monsters.
"My dear," I began, "if
you would rather I stayed"
"I thought you were going
to help me."
"Help you? To dressmake?"
"Oh, of course, if you 're so
superior that you can't con-
descend to anything lower
than blank verse"
'' My dear, you know it is
not that. But I simply know
nothing about dressmaking.
If you will teach me, I will try
to learn."
"Ah, that's my own dear
Jackums!"
"It's perfectly .simple,"
explained Gwen after wo had
undone our packages. "Yo\i
just pin on the patterns and
then you cut round them."
"I see," said I. "Do I pin them on
anywhere? I thought, as there is a
pattern on the cloth, perhaps"
"Perhaps it does," said GWEN.
"I think we had better cut it on the
cross," I hazarded.
Gwendolen looked at me much im-
pressed. "Where did you learn that,
Jack ?''
"I believe I saw it in a lady's paper the
other day. I thought you might know
what it meant."
"I daresay it's all right, but it sounds
rather complicated. I think we had
better just cut them anyhow."
"Very well," I acquiesced; and, Ailing
my mouth with pins, I proceeded with my
work.
"They—they look rather funny, don't
they?" asked Gwen, gazing doubtfully at
the quaint shapes that bestrewed the
floor.
"Very!" I agreed.
"I wonder what this can be?"
"I think it must be the trousers."
"Don't be silly."
I stole a look at Gwen. She was now
wearing that serious grim expression

JUST NOW "A TAKING SUBJECT" FOR CONVERSATION.
These three men, just back from the front, and recently
discovered in the smokino room of a well-known service club,

TURES of the Campaign, bit are describing the horrors of
THEIR RESPECTIVE VACCINATIONS. •
or heard of Gwendolen-. I be-
came alarmed, and creeping on
tiptoe to the study door, I
listened. I heard the sound
of sobs. An instant more and
Gwendolen was in my arms.
"B-b-both the sleeves are
for the right arm," she mur-
mured tearfully, "and there
isn't any b-b-back to the b-b-
b-b- bodice."
Wondering how even so
much had been extracted from
the mysterious fragments, I
attempted consolation. "We
must get some more cloth,
love."
"It was the last b-b-bit. It
was such a b-b-bargain."
Clearly the case was des-
perate; and, at any cost, Gwen
must be consoled. "Let us
give these to the poor," I
said, pointing to the frag-
ments; "and Gwen, I've
heard there's a very good
shop in Bond Street where
they make really first-class
dresses."
The sobs ceased. "Yes," I
continued, "the cloth wears
for ever, and the cut is Al.
Of course, it's a little bit
dearer than Miss Snippet; but
then you always look decent,
and it's really cheaper in the
end."
Gwen is, as she said she
would be, better dressed than
ever;-and if we are ever
troubled by doubts as to the
economy of the change from
the Snippet to Bond Street, we have only
to look at the Chippendale book-case to
which betokens that all sense of humour
has fled, and that she is not to be trifled
with. I remained silent, nervously await- see what we saved by her dismissal,
ing developments. Gwen picked up the! i =
pieces one by one, and tried to fit them
together.
"It's like a horrid Chinese puzzle,"
she sighed, after many- futile efforts,
"Can you see how they go, Jack?"
"My dear, if you can't do it, how
can I?"
"You might at least try."
"Very well," I said. But before I had
succeeded in piecing two bits together,
Gwendolen took them from my hands.
"Men are so clumsy," she said.
"You'd better go and smoke."
Delighted at the suggestion, I made
towards the door, but paused with my
hand on the handle. Gwendolen was
sighing like a furnace, and her brow was
lined with care. "I wonder," I sug-
gested, "if I should ride over for Miss
Snitpet?"
"No!" said Gwendolen, with great
decision; and, without venturing another
word, I slunk from the room.
Some hours passed. Nothing was seen
Mr. PUNCH'S MUSEUM.—"Buckler {Early
Twentieth Century Model)." An exhibit
which exemplifies a curious law of de-
velopment. In the middle ages it was
regarded as a useful means of defence,
taking the form of a small circular
shield worn by foot-soldiers. After a
period of many years' abeyance it reap-
peared as an item of naval equipment.
It was then intended to be of so highly
offensive a nature as to be termed a
"destroyer." This it undoubtedly turned
out to be, though not in the sense
proposed. It proved highly offensive to
the tax-payer instead of to the enemy.
It was so ready to " buckle to " and got to
work of its own accord as a submarine,
that every specimen, except this model,
now lies in two pieces at the bottom of
one of the Pour Seas within a few cables
length of the shore. Many millions ster-
ling were sunk in this way, the Admiralty
professing to regard their wrecks as Bri-
tannia's most effective bulwark.

356 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 13, 1901.
LIGHTER LONDON.
An Improbable Dialogue of ihe Future.
It was a sunny morning in November.
The elderly gentleman from Mnwangaboo
stepped from the electric train on to the
spotless platform of the London terminus.
As he did so, another old gentleman,
ruddy and jovial, clasped his hand.
"Tom, old felloe," he said, "how glad
I am to see you after all these years!"
"Why, it's Jack!" cried the traveller,
"bless you, how well you look! Any-
one would think you lived in the country.
And what weather J you 've got! Why,
where's the fog?"
"Gone!" said the other, still shaking
hands vigorously, "of course, when you
went out in command of that batch of
rheumatic recruits we were plagued with
it still."
"I should think you were," replied the
Colonist, "that was in the fifth year of
the war."
"I don't remember what year of the
war it was," said the Londoner, "for we
lost all count of time in that. I remember
it was when the income tax was half-a-
crown, about the time that someone pro-
posed to put the war into the hands of
the London County Council, as a business-
like sort of body. But don't let's talk
about Queen Axne, or the war, or any-
thing else that's over and done with at
last. Come along home in ray motor, and
tell me all about Mnwangaboo and your
commissionership."
So the two walked out into the clean,
sunlit station yard, where there was a
pleasant breeze, took their seats in the
Deat little carriage, and sped away over
mudless roadways — without a single
trench in them — through wide tree-
planted streets, lined with white stone
houses, gleaming in the autumn sunshine.
The Commissioner of Mnwangaboo gazed
open-eyed. Then ho burst out, "But, 1
say, what have you done with London?
Where's the fog? It seems to me that 1
must be in Paris, only it's cleaner than
Paris used to be in my time. I don't
know this part at all. Is it Mayfair
altered?"
"Not it!" answered the Londoner,
"it's just exactly where Drury Lane used
to be. The atmosphere is rather improved,
isn't it? People get sunburnt in London
in the summer now. Many come up from
the country in the autumn to avoid the fogs.
Here's my flat, up there on the fifth floor."
"Yes, but how on earth was it done?"
asked the Colonist, as they shot up in the
lift.
"Sit here," said the other, pointing to
an easy chair in the sunny library, "and
I 'II tell you all about it. You don't
mind the sunshine streaming in?"
The Commissioner shifted uneasily.
"No, perhaps not," ho said; "I should
never think of having such a thing in
Mnwangaboo. Perhaps that blind might
be a little,down, the light is so very
strong. Thanks. Now I can see you.
Well, how was it managed?"
"My dear TOM," said the Londoner,
"the simplest thing in the world, when
once it wtis thought of. The County
Council of that time began some wonder-
fully elaborate experiments. They threw
up little air balloons, and they fired off
little rockets, and they took the tempera-
ture of the fog, and they noted whether it
was dry or moist, and they calculated how
many inches away they could see an
omnibus—you remember the old omni-
buses? By Jove, how people would laugh
if they saw one now, though they could
hardly see one then because of the fog!
But still nothing happened. Then suddenly
it occurred to somebody that there was
never a fog when there was a brisk wind.
So they fixed big metal fans on the Great
Wheel at that rather dismal sort of place
called an Exhibition, principally long
passages and staircases and advertise-
ments, don't you remember? Then they
sent the Great Wheel round as fast as it
would go, and the fog cleared off as far as
Kensington High Street. They couldn't
get a breeze farther than that. However,
the principle of the thing was settled.
Of course it was impossible to have such
hideous things as Great Wheels all over
London. Then somebody invented the
Electric Blowers, which now keep the air
in movement day and night."
"I understand," said the Commissioner,
"how they move the fog. But what takes
the smoke right away?"
"Why, the Fog Drain of course,"
answered the other, "which somebody
else got the' idea of. There's a great
underground tube from the front of the
Royal Exchange to somewhere beyond
Barking in Essex. It has a sort of metal
plug in it, and the plug is moved along
somehow by electricity and this makes a
vacuum behind it, as far as I understand.
Then the fog rushes in and fills the tube,
and the plug comes out. Then another
plug starts, pushes all this smoky air out
beyond Barking, and draws in another
tubeful. I believe the idea came from a
pneumatic tube. When it was first started
some stockbrokers were nearly sucked in
from the steps of the Royal Exhange. It
is better protected now. Of course there
are Smoke Pipes from other parts of
London. After that they made Air Tubes
on the same system from Knockholt
Beeches and Box Hill and Harrow. It's a
marvellous improvement, isn't it?"
"Well," said the Colonist, "it's very
clever and very wonderful, and no doubt
it's awfully good for the health. But
somehow the old fog used to seem home-
like. When I first went to Mnwangaboo,
with its beastly blue sky and its con-
founded sunshine, I often longed for a
good old ' London Particular'"
"Stop!" shouted the other, "don't
call it that, or you '11 be fined. The news-
paper writers worked that name so hard
that, out of respect for DICKENS and to
save people from going crazy, a law was
made to inflict a fine of forty shillings on
anyone saying or writing that."
"Ah, well," concluded the Commis-
sioner, "you may call it what you please,
and very likely it's all for the best. But
somehow I seem to miss something."
"By Jove," cried the Londoner,
impatiently, "some people are never
satisfied!" H. D. B.
MILK—OH!
[According to the Daily Graphic of November 7,
whiskers, it appears, form the latest danger to the
purity of our morning's milk. The New York
Medical Milk Commission state in a report just
issued that "the milk from a cow that is milked
by a smooth-faced man is purer than the milk from
a cow milked by a man with whiskers," the reason
being that the whiskers collect microbes from the
sir, and these are shaken off into the milk during
the process of milking.]
This is the Milk we pay for.
This is the Cow that wasn't a pump,
Nor over the moon was known to jump,
But provided the Milk we pay for.
This is the local Dairyman
Who habitually held a pail or can
Underneath the Cow that wasn't a pump,
But much too staid and obese to jump,
While providing the Milk we pay for!
These are the Whiskers that ran to seed
O'er the face (like a patch of garden-weed)
Of the local and innocent Dairyman
Who at cock-crow would hold a pail or can
To comfort the Cow, not to mention the
pump
That assisted them o'er the law to jump
And provided the " Milk " we pay for.
These are the Microbes all alive
Which daily delighted to take a dive
In the cream from the Whiskers that ran
to seed
On the face (that resembled a patch of weed)
Of the hairy unwary Dairyman,
Who twice in the day would fill his can
With the aid of the Cow and aforesaid pump,
Until the Inspector would make them jump,
While providing the Milk we pay for.
This is the Baby, five months old,
Who, somewhat disgusted, had to hold
A bottle of Microbes all alive
That had q uitted their perch and made a di ve
From the Whiskers that ran, as I've said,
to seed
O'er the face (that required a.rake to weed)
Of the hirsute and hurtful Dairyman,
Who made it his business to take his can
From the same old Cow to the same old
pump,
And rattle his tins till from sleep we jump,
And take in the Skim we pay for.
This is the Milk we '11 owe for I A. A. S.

[November 13, 1901.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE third volume of the Supplement to the Dictionary of
National Biography (Smith, Elder) brings the annexe of a monu-
mental work down, to .the letter W. The longest and most im-
portant article is that on the late Queen, contributed by the
Editor. It is marked by that gift of insight and grace of diction
that distinguishes Mr. SYDNEY Lee's contributions to this field of
literature. It stands and, with limitations necessitated by its
condensation, will remain the best thing yet written about
Queen Victoria. Other articles of interest are those dealing
with Huxley, William Morris, James Payn, Ruskin, Sir
Arthur Sullivan, and Sir John Millais. Intimate through
life, in death these last two are not divided in the volumes of
the great Dictionary. A notice of Lord Russell of Killowen
from the pen of his countryman and long-time friend, Lord
Justice Mathew, is a model of conciseness and comprehen-
siveness. My Baronite turned the pages in search of record
of the long, honourable, and useful life of the head of the firm
who have endowed the world with this magnificent work. The
innate modesty of George Smith kept him ever in the, back-
ground when recognition of merit was to the fore. It is quite
conceivable that it is in accordance with his instructions that
no room is found in the Dictionary for him. That is, perhaps,
excess of modesty. The world could not know too much of
the high character and generous nature of the man who, in
early life, discovered Charlotte Bronte, and at the close of
his career lavished care and money oh an undertaking which,
regarded from a commercial point of view, was from the outset
hopelessly unremunerative. After all there is a fitness in
the state of things. WREN has no monument in St. Paul's
Cathedral, nor has GEORGE Smith a page in the National
Dictionary of Biography. Those who have the volumes on their
library shelves will recall and adapt the closing line of the
inscription on Wren's tombstone, Si monumentum requiris, cir-
cumspice.
Of Mr. Punch's Dramatic Sequela, by Sr. JOHN Hankin
(Bradbury, Agnew & Co.), it would scarcely become the
Baron, seeing that the Sequela bear Mr. l'unch'a imprimatur,
to say more than this, that as many ns arc not already familiar
with these Sequela should by no maimer of means lose this
chance of making their acquaintance in book form; while
those who have recently enjoyed them in Mr. Punch's pages
will do well to develop their appreciation of them by reperusing
the artistic carrying out of a decidedly original idea. The
likenesses suggested by Mr. E. J. Wheeler's illustrations are
quite in keeping with the author's peculiar vein of humour.
"'Good morning,' ho said. 'It is good of you to come. 1
am sorry I haven't been able to shave.'" Thus on his death-
bed spoke Major lredale, who really, though not nominally, is
the hero of Miss Montresor's fine story, The Alien (Methuen).
The plot is reminiscent of the musty Tichborne case. But it is
managed even more skilfully than the Claimant conducted his
affair. Whilst the Major is a cleverly-drawn character, a
simple-minded, strictly disciplined, slightly selfish, wholly
honest soldier, he is not alone in marked individuality. Mra.
Mordant, to whose estate ho is heir in law, is moulded with
skill aud touched with a certain grim humour. On the whole,
my Baronite has found the book interesting beyond the average.
In The Giant's date (Casskll & Co.) the author, Max Pember-
TON, not by any means at his best, gives us a rather confusing
and considerably over-spun-out yarn, commencing with the
invention of a submarine boat, and a trial trip therein, which at
once recalls Jules Verne's A Hundred Thousand (or whatever
the number was) Leagues Under the Sea. After this there are
some sensational incidents of a not particularly novel character,
which scarcely assist in just keeping alive to the end the
reader's waning interest in the story.
My Juniorest Baronitess informs me that WALTER CRANE'S
beautiful "Picture Book " (John. Lane), engraved aud printed
by Edmund Evans, is a capitally arranged volume of Fairy
Tales, with numerous original illustrations and coloured plates.
The old favourites, Goody Two Shoes, Aladdin, aud the Yellow
Dwarf, are comprised in this collection. It will make many
little eyes glisten with delight, "and no nursery which re-
spects itself," says B. Juniorest aforesaid, "should be without
this fascinating picture-book."
Also, while on the subject, my Juniorest Baronitess has not
the slightest hesitation in recommending Miss Katharine
Tynan's latest book, entitled A Girl of Galway (BLACKIE and
Son), to all young lady readers. The heroine's devices for
gaining the love of her miserly and evil-tempered old grand-
father are crowned with success; but how she' achieves this
my Juniorest Baronitess leaves the readers of the story to
discover for themselves.
The Lovely Mrs. Pemberton, by Florence Warden (John Long),
is, to the Baron's thinking, one of her best. It might have been
quite her best but for the lack of originality in the character
of Lord Thannington, an inferior variety of the Lord Steyne
genus. The very young, very simple, unsuspecting but a
trifle too artless Nannie is prettily d rawn, while her hus-
band, the youthful solicitor, clever in business, but stupid to a
degree as a husband, is an artistic study of character. His
mischief-making sister is equally good. The other personages
are well drawn, and each one has a distinct mission in carrying
out the perfectly simple but well worked out plot of a thor-
oughly interesting story. Florence Warden evidently intends
young wives to cull from it an excellent moral, which is,
"Never mind how dull you may be at home; never accept any
invitations that do» not include your husband." And for
husbands—
Pray be careful what you 're about —
Be generous, kind, and hearty,
But never let your wife dine out
Unless you are one of the party.
And this is a nice domestic moral (after Doctor Watts' style)
of which all Barons will, and of which all Baronesses ought to,
highly approve.
It is with the greatest pleasure that the Baron welcomes the
appearance of a volume entitled Then and Now (Hutchinson &
Co.), written by Dean Hole, whom, as companion of Mark
Lemon, Shirley Brooks, Douglas Jerrold and Thackeray,
also as travelling and collaborating with John Leech in their
Little Tour in Ireland, and as cequalia with Sir John Tbnnikl,
Mr. Punch is delighted to reckon among his staunchest friends
and earliest contributors. Known to fame not only as a horti-
culturist specially skilled in rose-growing, but also as a keen
observer of men and manners, the amiable and witty Dean
button-holes the reader and gives him some of his finest and
freshest observations on Then and Noiu, showing how justly he
appreciates every varying phase of society without being a
mere " laudator temporia acti." Not a hint of fogeyism about
him; but the'strong personality of a highly cultivated—and,
as a scientific gardener, highly cultivating—genial, Christian
gentleman, the best type of an English clergyman of the old

Douglas Jerrold's immortal Caudle Lectures, as all the
world knows, first appeared in Mr. Punch'a pages, and there
made the most notable success that Jerrold had up to that
time achieved, although, according to Mr. Spielmann, quoted
by Mr. Walter Jerrold (who has written a preface to this new
edition published by Brimley Johnson), he "always affected
not to think "that they had " added greatly to his reputation."

there any other -work of Jerrold'S that has achieved a lasting
popularity? None. And specially'welcome to those who know
their Caudle well, and to those who have yet to become
acquainted with this happy specimen of an ordinary middle-
class couple, will be this collection of the celebrated " curtain
lectures," characteristically illustrated by Charles Keene
(perfectly at home when engaged on such a subject), with
delightfully eccentric " head and tail " pieces by Dicky Doyle
(whether they were "heads or tails" he won with both), and
some cute by John Leech, who here is not "in it" with
Charles Keene. Thoroughly amusing, and therefore highly
recommended by THE Baron de B.-W.
THOMPSON ON "TINNED COW."
ill.
When it was found out that "Tinned Cow" was a sneak
—by birth, as you might say—chaps naturally chucked him
over; and Maynard refused to let the kid fag for him any more;
and I, of course, told him I was no longer his chum. He made
a frightful fuss about this, and implored me to go on being his
chum, and offered me a Chinese charm that had undoubtedly
been the eye of a Buddhist idol in its time; but he was such an
utter worm, and took such a heathen view of things, that I had
to refuse the charm and .let him go. He was frightfully down
about it, and slunk about in corners and offered to make kites
for the smallest kids in the school—simply that he might have
somebody friendly to him.
When I think he was beginning to change his mind about
England being better than China, the last straw came in the
shape of a new boy called Vernon Verb—a chap of a good
age—sixteen at least. He was the grandson of a Viscount, or
a Marquis, or some such person, and he explained that with
any luck he would be a Marquis himself some day, because his
only brother, though older, having shaky lungs, for which he
was in the Canary Islands at that moment, might pass away and
lose his turn.
I heard what followed from CoRKEY Minimus, who was MlLLY's
spy and carrier, for which he got a peaeh from tho Doctor's
orchard-house now and again, but only ones that fell off. He
told me that MlLLY received no less than three letters from
Vernon Vere before he'd been at Merivale a month. And the
third she answered.
So we knew that "Tinned Cow" was done for; and very
soon he found it out himself, and then he turned several shades
yellower and moped in the gymnasium for hours together, and
lost all hope of doing any good at work, and sank down to the
bottom of the Lower Third, and spent all his spare time doing
impositions. He went about like a dog that's frightened of
being kicked; and many chaps did kick him, out of sheer cheer-
fulness, because he seemed as if he only wanted a kick to
complete the picture. Then", one day, very civilly, he asked
"Freckles" for his celebrated bowie-knife that he goes bush-
ranging with on half-holidays and carries inside his trousers
for that purpose. And "Freckles" very kindly lent it, after
"Tinned Cow" had promised not to cut anything harder than
wood with it. Then "Tinned Cow" thanked him and went
into the gym., saying that he only wanted to cut some-
thing soft. He didn't come back, and when the bell rang,
"Freckles" and I—he being rather anxious about his bowie-
knife—went up to the gym. to seo what "Tinned Cow" was
after. Suddenly '' Freckles '' shouted out from the shower-bath
room, and, hearing him yell, I rushed in. And there was the
wretched " Tinned Cow " in a most horrible fix. He'd taken
off his shirt and given himself a dig in the ribs, or possibly two,
and he was lying in a comfortable position bleeding to death.
At least, so he hoped; and he begged us earnestly to mind our
own business and leave him to " salute the world," as he said,
without any bother. But we hooked it for Thwaites and
Browne and Jackson; and they came and carried him in; and
ruined their clothes with Chinese gore.
Of course we all thought "Tinned Cow" was booked, and
"Freckles," knowing the sharpness of his knife, said the kid
must kick to a certainty if he'd used the knife with proper
firmness. Yet, strange to relate, he didn't die, but lived;
which seemed to show that the knife of "Freckles" wasn't
nearly such a fine one as he fancied. But he said that it only
showed " Tinned Cow " had lost his nerve, and funked what he
was doing at the critical moment.
Two mornings afterwards Dr. Dunstan told us all he knew
after prayers in his finest style, ending with a sermon.
"This unhappy Asiatic, this young Celestial, from the un-
tutored and pagan fastnesses of China, despite months not a
few of tuition in this our manly and civilised atmosphere of
Merivale, has relapsed upon the degraded and barbaric customs
of his benighted country—a proof of heredity and the natural
cowardice and baseness of the human heart when unillumined
by the light of Christianity. The vain folly which led him to
his rash act is not for your ears. Let it suffice that Tin Lin
Chow, in a fit of mental infirmity, not to say active insanity,
sought to deliver himself from imaginary miseries by the act of
self-destruction—the Harri-Kari of his country, or Happy
Despatch, as we may translate it. Thanks to fear at the crucial
moment, or an ignorance of his own anatomy, or, as we must
rather believe, the direct interposition of a merciful Providence,
Tin Lin Chow failed of his fearful project and is now out of
danger. For the rest, I may inform you that the lad, when fit
to travel, will return to his native land, and I can only hope
and pray that the traditions of Merivale, its teaching and its
tone, will cleave to him; but I fear that TIN will all too soon
relapse into the pristine paganism of his unhappy country."
Here he went on with the sermon part, which I forget.
Of course the thing that "was not for our ears" was the
reason why this little Chinese idiot had tried to kill himself.
And that was because MlLLY Dunstan and everybody had
chucked him, but especially MlLLY. Anyway, his vitals healed
up in a fortnight, and after six weeks or so had passed by he
was back at school again. But only for a few days. Then a
ship sailed from London for China and, as Stegoles very truly
said, the only Happy Despatch that "Tinned Cow " got was a
despatch back to his native land. And probably he liked it
better than England, when all was said and done; because the
schools out there have got no Sixth Forms, so he told us.
Therefore he '11 be all right very likely—and live to thank his
stars that he didn't kill himself after all. Though myself, I
think he honestly tried and tho fault was in the knife. Still,
after two such sickening failures—I mean Milly Dunstan, and
the attempt to slay himself—I expect the kid won't ever want
to make friends with girls again, or try to Harri-Kari his
wretched stomach, but just lead an ordinary sort of life with-
out fuss, like other people do.
I made it up with him in a sort of way after his attempt to
kill himself failed; and he explained to me how he ought to
have done it; but the details were no use to me, because I
wouldn't kill myself for all the girls in the world. Then
"Tinned Cow" left, and he seemed sorry to go, if you will
believe it, at the last moment; and he promised to send me
materials for birds'-nest soup and other interesting things.
But he never did; and I never thought he would, and didn't
count upon it in the least, because, once back in his own
country, where everybody tells lies from morning till night,
simply from the habit of centuries and centuries, owing to
China being the birthplace of civilisation, you couldn't expect
the beggar to keep his word. And nobody in this country will
ever hear of him again. Not that that matters. But if I ever
go to China, which I very likely shall, I may look him up, I
think, just to seo if he got any good from coming over here
or has "relapsed into his pristine paganism," as old DUNSTAN
bet he would. Eden Phillpotts.

What about the story? A good-natured
kind of man marries for money. He is
absolutely correct in his conduct to his
wife. No "cruelty" of any kind that
Sir Francis Jecne would recognise. Well-

had it not been that the lady had passed
out of his life when the temptation of a
perfectly suitable wife with an equally
suitable banking account crossed him.
Then the suitable wife commits suicide,
and lets the newly-married pair know the
manner of her death. A pleasant legacy!
And what do the newly-married pair
say? Something to the effect that a
pale face peering from the waves (the
vindictive wife had thrown herself into
the sea) will separate them for ever.
Nonsense. Probably, in this prosaic age,
the husband would have observed, "My
own, of course we are very sorry
indeed about poor dear fanciful Mil-
dred. But really, take it all round,
we did our level best to behave well
under the peculiar circumstances of the

up at Hampstead, seeing no one, and I

conducted dinners I don't know what I

all was going well, she passes away in the

I.
At the Carlton Restaurant.
Yes, as you justly say, the times are bad,
And yield a very bitter food for thought
To -whoso loves his country. Take this war
Whereof the promised end is still to seek.
I miss that manhood's rage of sacrifice
Responsive on the instant call to arms
"Which sent us out one-third per cent., no less,
Of all our able-bodied—I myself,
Though bachelor, in what request you know,
Had most indubitably volunteered
But for the claims of service nearer home,
A mine to run, a broad estate to nurse,
A thousand faithful workmen's throats to fill,
Capital's task that keeps our England great
By those same means that made us what we are.
(Waiter! another Veuve, the '91.)
And here's this public, zealous-hot of late,
Incurious now how long the business lasts,
Impatient only of the tardy end
When it awakes at intervals to note
Its pockets nearly touched—not theirs alone,
The plutocrats', but such as yours and mine,
The not-too-grasping (try those ortolans !)
Who own a paltry million, say, apiece,
And shrewdly feel the pinch of imminent need,
Being mulct i' th' matter o' duty laid on coal,
Or tax on income earned by sweat of brow.
You blame the Government, and rightly too—
Supposed expert at rounding off a war,
And kept for just that end by you and me,
Who pay them amply, getting no results.
And these young carpet captains, blue of blood,
Sleek idlers, players o' polo, sporting lights,
Pets of the women, pampered, overfed—
(You pass the muffle? 'Tis the local chef's
Unique creation !)—overfed, I say,
Gapingly void of what intelligence
The leadership of fighting men demands!
Why, there's a scandal exigent of reform!
Brave, are they? Well, and what of that? say I;
It's in the incurable English bones of us.
Instance what courage served i' th' face of odds
To lift our parents up the primal rungs
O' th' ladders you and I command to-day ;—
Sheer dogged pluck! but, look you, closely wed
With craftsman's wit, eye ope and ear alert
On track o' th' main chance, unattainablo'else.
Plain working virtues these, and left intact
To us the inheritors, who need them less
Yet use them still to keep the thing they won!
Pass, next, to art and letters; how explain
The mediocrity that gets us known
For "Europe's Suburb " (good Pinero's phrase),
Save on the ground of overflowing wealth,
Luxury's curse (a kiimmel with your ice?
It aids digestion !) luxury's curse that kills
These soft creative fancies in the bud?
Not so with our superb commercial gifts!
For where, by now, had England's name declined!
Had we, the heirs of easy competence,
So far forgot the duty owed ourselves
As to repose our talents under earth
In lieu of turning them to noble ends,
Divinely discontent with what we have,
Insatiate of extracting more from much?
Thank Heaven! the Stock Exchange is with us still,
A Spartan remedy good against the germs
Of general dissolution. This away,
I dare not think what fate should overwhelm
A land so sunk in comfortable sloth.
Another peach? You're sure? Then we'11 adjourn
To th' hall below for coffee and cigars.
Where did we take it last the Turkish way?
Ah, yes, the Place Vendome! You run across
From time to time to patronise the Ritz?

Being a busy man with simple tastes,
I find the Carlton good enough for me. O. S.
ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.
(Note from the Travel Diary of Tobt, M.P.)

In the near foreground, tivo children playing hide-and-seek
round an upright tombstone. Two old iwmeti, in rusty black

Second 0. W. Aye, that '11 make a nice difference. I was

LIVES OF GREAT MEN.
No. V.—Homer Tiieopeltlus Renton.
(Concluded.)
A dining clnb there -was of men
Prepared to puff their fellows;
"Whoever wielded brush or pen.
The rest applied the bellows.
Young Renton needed -wind to fan
His dull poetic embers;
He much approved the puffing plan,
And so ho joined the members.
His early efforts were not high—
A Triolet, or Sonnet,
An Ode to Araminta's Eye,
A Ballade on her Bonnet.
These little tricks of sentiment
Were voted flue, but finer
His "Stanzas to our President
Considered as a Diner."
He exercised his'intellect
On " Ceua going Shrimping,"
In thirty lines of poor effect,
As limp as they were limping.
He hymned her pink and tender toes
Divested of their stocking
(Of course the beggar called it "hose,"
And seemed to think it shooking).
He praised her ankle trim and neat,
And said, about her tootsies,
How sweet a sight a pair of feet
Without a pair of boots is.
Next he composed a Villanelle
(He knew that if you rub men
The right way down you please them
well)
On all his fellow club-men.
His fellow club-men cheered the lad,
His praise with praises matching;
They scratched his back, for each one
had
A back that wanted scratching.
And so in time he came to be,
Although he did his work ill,
The poet of a coterie,
The singer of a circle.
But soon he felt ambition stir;
Such private praise seemed stinted;
He found a pliant publisher,
And got his poems printed.
Some poets, men of heart and soul,
The sort that fame is bright with,
Have private stacks of native coal
To keep their Are alight with.
They count no cost, but feed the flame,
However small their earning,
And give no heed to praise or blame
If but the Are keeps burning.
Our hero wrorked in other ways
To eke his bardic fate out:
Where others heaped with coal the
blaze
He went and raked the grate out.

Miss Feathcrkead. "I hope you are feeling better to-day, Mb. Boreham 1'
Mr. B. "No, I'm vert dull and low-spirited."
Miss F. "Ah, but you bebh more yourself I"
Then, sifting through his metric sieves
These literary cinders,
He took some good infinitives
And split them into flinders.
(You see I drop the metaphor,
But metaphors are vexing;
To keep them up grows more and more
Unspeakably perplexing.)
Of random rhymes he had a pack
By which he was outwitted
And dragged—he couldn't call them
back—
Beyond what sense permitted.
Nay, sometimes he was cockneyfled,
And when the day was " dawning,"
The poet all the rules defied,
And made it rhyme with "morning."
Some ravening critics left their cage—
They bared their teeth for tearing—
And took each palpitating page
And rent_it past repairing.
They plied their most sarcastic pens
To make the poet rue it;
Romeike sent the specimens,
And so the author knew it.
Nothing availed this first defeat
To keep the man from fighting:
He owned a bullet-proof conceit,
And simply went on writing.
Let Culture, when she hears his name,
Deny his reputation,—
A sort of poet he becamo
By force of iteration.
And, quoted in no causerie,
Nor talked about in leaders,
By some strange chance he seems to be
A man of many readers. R. C. L.
Suggested Motto of the New Prince
and Princess of Wales (in view of the
many banquets to which tltey have been

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 20, 1901.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
As the hand of the dyer is subdued to the colour of the
liquid he works in, so is the pen of Mr. Stanley Weyman
steeped in the colour of tho old French Court. Count Hannibal
(Smith, Elder) presents a series of vivid pictures of the Court
of Charles the Ninth, and of life beyond its precincts. The
story opens with a dramatic scene in the Louvre on the eve of
the massacre of St. Bartholomew. That long-drawn tragedy is
dashed on the pages in all its lurid terror. Interest properly
centres round the hero, Count Hannibal, a ruthless soldier,
lured first by passion, gradually enchained in the links of love.
The strange thing in the Court of Charles the Ninth is the
circumstance that the object of his affection is his wedded wife.
The wedding, like the wooing, is an affair that deepens my
Baronite's longing for the good old times. Count Hannibal is,
at least to begin with, what we in these days should call a
rufUan. So skilful is the art of Mr. Stanley Weyman that
the fierce Count gradually wins his way into the reader's esteem,
as, after picturesque vicissitudes, he does into his wife's heart.
This original and striking character is cleverly contrasted with
the Huguenot lover, a well-intentioned but wavering reed.
Mrs. Henry Dudeney's work possesses, as a rule, the definite
charm of individuality. Her latest novel, The Spindle and
Plough (Heinemann), is bright and attractively interesting.
Though not quite so strong as her Folly Corner, it is con-
siderably superior to the ordinary novel. Evidently the
gardening mania, which has affected much of the literature
this year, has given Mrs. Dudeney the ingenious idea of making
her heroine an uncommon specimen of the " woman gardener."
The characters all stand out well defined, but none so abso-
lutely as the feather-headed, vain, elderly mother, from whom
the girl learns to regard matrimony with the utmost aversion.
Hence the title. A fresh, breezy, healthy story.
The Young Barbarians (Hodder and Stoughton), with whom
Ian McLaren deals, are the boys at Muirtown Seminary. They
are real flesh and blood and fist boys. The atmosphere of the
school breathes over every page. Splueg (Scottish for sparrow),
a name bestowed by the boys in recognition of his impudence,
his courage, his endurance, his cockiness, and his boundless
ingenuity in mischief, is a delightful boy—though not for the
best parlour. So, on another level, is Duncan Robertson. The
account of their rescuing from embrace of the swift Tay the
little English boy, Nestie, is in its humour and pathos equal
to anything Ian McLaren has written. After all, doubtless
unintentionally, possibly unknowingly, the best character in
the book is that of the old writing and mathematical master,
Dugald MacKinnon, known to the boys as "Bulldog." He
is almost as good as the Doctor, dear to Drumtochty. My
Baronite feels that in the way of praise of portraiture it is
difficult to go beyond that admission.
Marion Crawford is at his very best in Marietta, A Maid of
Venice (Maomillan & Co.). It is a powerfully dramatic story
of Venice under "The Ten," told in a series of picturesque
scenes described in strikingly artistic word-painting, the
action being carried on by well-imagined, clearly-defined
characters. Perfect is the description of Venice, and of the
hour of Ave Maria. Hero and heroine are skilfully drawn types;
while the quaint old salt Pasquale, retired from active naval
service and now gate-porter to Beroviero, the celebrated glass-
blower, is drawn with the keenest sense of humour. The
revenge taken by Anstarcbi, the pirate, on the Venetian aristo-
cratic dandy, Contarini, is deliciously original. Altogether, the
Baron has no hesitation in pronouncing this romance equal to
the best among the same author's notable contributions to
romantic literature.
The Wouldbegoods, by E. Nesbit (T. Fisher Unwin), is more
or less a sequel to the Treasure Seekers, which was the starting-
point of this interesting yet every-day family of boys and girls.
Their further adventures, and the practical formation of their
society of Wouldbegoods is full of thrilling interest. A book
to be read with pleasure by even those old enough to have
passed that period of life when naughtiness has its own peculiar
phase of enjoyment. "But," asks the Baron of himself, "what
'period of life ' may ' that' be?"
No bettor gift book could be found for a boy than G. A.
HENTY'S latest work, entitled At the Point of the Bayonet,
effectively illustrated by Wal Paget. It is an exciting tale of
the Mahratta War, full of hard fighting, gallant rescues, and
narrow escapes. Harry Lindsay is a most attractive hero, and
one for whom all readers will have an intense admiration. The
boys who are so fortunate as to get the book as a Christmas
present will enjoy many hours of supremo delight. As for the
taking title, it sounds sensational, as naturally would be the
position of anyone "at the point of the bayonet." The above
and the three following are from Messrs. Blackie and Son.
In the Days of Prince Hal; or, The Little Forester. H. ELRING-
ton tells a pretty story of a forester's children, Wat and
Hal Wainflete, calculated to please youthful readers. The
scene is laid in the New Forest. Encountering many adven-
tures and enduring great misfortune, Hal proves himself a
thorough hero. My Juniorest Baronitess informs me that she
highly commends this tale. A Little Irish Girl (J. M. Callwell)
gives us the story of Norah O'Brien and her small brother
Manus, who, in their encounters with seals, with smugglers,
with a hard-hearted uncle, and with a ghost, come off
triumphant. Capitally told and well worth reading. For the
Old School, by Florence Coombe, is a spirited story for boys,
well illustrated by Paul Hardy, whose name suggests that,
were there a Gardeners' Book published regularly every Christ-
mas, this artist should bo engaged upon designs in the " Hardy
Annual" department.
Mrs. Boyd spent a pleasant Versailles Christmas-tide (Chatto
and WlNDUS), and succeeds in drawing the reader within the
circle of pleasure. As she confesses, Versailles at Christmas
is a hopelessly dull place. But gentle dulness, hard to suffer
at close quarters, is agreeable enough to study when chatted
of by Mrs. Boyd, her conversation illuminated by the drawings
of A. S. B. Of these there are fifty-three, done on the spot,
instinct with life and colour, of denizens in the old French
town. Mrs. Boyd has a quiet sense of humour, which scintil-
lates over tho pages. Any in search of an attractive Christmas
present should look up this dainty volume.
Unfortunately for Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, A Christmas
Carol delighted the world many years before Mr. GRANT Richards
published Santa Claus's Partner. Undeterred by that circum-
stance, he has undertaken to write over again Charles
Dickens's masterpiece. Rarely has a similar task been carried
out with such daringly close parallel. For Old Scrooge in his
counting house in the heart of the City of London we have
Berryman Livingstone "seated in his cushioned chair in his
inner private office in the best office building in the City"
of New York. His over-worked, under-paid clerk is not
Bob Cratchit but John Clark. Tiny Tim becomes the little
daughter of Mr. Clark. For the rest, there is a Christmas Eve
party at the house of the poor clerk, into which the rich
employer, converted to Christmas, bursts, carries off the little
girl in his sledge, buys up the contents of a toy-shop, loads a
Christmas-tree, and finally not only pays off the mortgage on his
clerk's house, but takes him into partnership. From this it will
be perceived that Mr. Page is a bold man. My Baronite confesses
that, having read both books, he prefers The Christmas Carol.
All the same, Santa Claits's Partner is a very pretty story.
ALLEN Upward's romance, entitled Tfie Ambassador's Adventure
(CASSELL & Co., Limited), would be as much to the taste of the
lover of "sensation" as a woodcock in season to the gourmet,
were it not that the story suffers, as would the dainty little
bird, from being overdone. It has yet another fault, and that
is its form, since it is presented to the reader as a narrative
told by the Ambassador himself, for no particular purpose, to

an attentive listener, much as the Ancient Mariner button-
holed the wedding guest, only that in this case the listener is
ready and willing, while the Ambassador is as a " blessed Ben-
deveer," whose peculiar privilege it was to be loquacious at
the expense of a victimised listener. The story, which com-
mences well and fairly excites the curiosity of the reader,
acquires, as it proceeds, a flavour of burlesque which is fatal
to its realism. A secret anti-Anarchist "Royal Society" is
an idea that should prove valuable to a librettist of comic
opera, associated with a safely popular composer, but which,
worked out as it is by Allen Upward, is fatal to a romance
intended to be taken seriously. The Baron de B.-W.

"and the Constable "—Good heavens!—" being among the few
exceptions."—"Thank you! I don't want any more police
news," said Mr. L.'s aunt. "But I must say I am glad that
'Mrs. Trotter' was trotted off by the constable. Whoever
she is, she ought to be ashamed of herself." [Needless perhaps
to explain that Mrs. L.'s nephew was giving the old lady an
extract from the Times report of the Gainsborouohs —' the

Come, buckle tight my hauberk on, and reach me down my pike,

And, boldly as I venture forth to wage the conflict fell,

Ho! comrades, muster for the fray, be neither slow nor slack,
Seize every coigne of vantage, and make ready the attack;
And take what cover best ye may to ward off counterblows,
Then on, press onward with the cry, " Confusion to our foes!"
We wage no far-off conflict with Afridi or with Boer,

Brave must he be of heart, and as a flint must set his face,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 20, 1901.
AN OPINION ON PALMISTRY.
I beg to say that I am flattered to have
been desired by the Editor of the leading
forensic journal (himself a member of the
Bar) to give an opinion upon the merits or
demerits—as governed by the incidents of
the case—of palmistry. I will not enter
into the question -whether palmistry comes
under the category of obtaining money
under false pretences, or any kindred mis-
demeanour. I will merely use my powers
of observation—which may be taken to
comprise a trained legal intellect, for I
passed, after not a few years of earnest
intellectual endeavour, the examination
necessary to securing my admission to
the Outer Bar, and kept all my dining terms
with the same object—to the sifting of
the bona tides of the palmist qua palmist,
and not qua possible infringer of the laws
of the country. For the sake of conveni-
ence and also to render my opinion more
palatable to the general reader I will
breakup my "points" under italic side-
headings.
Personal Appearance of the Palmist.—
Decidedly prepossessing. Costume in
excellent taste. Just a touch of the
Oriental in the shape of an Egyptian
necklace and a soupcon of the barbaric in
the gold-mounted shark's-tooth brooch.
Soft voice—softer touch.
Mode of Procedure.—She begged me to
show her both my hands. First she
examined them palms uppermost, then
palms reversed. Then she pondered and
told me I had been married. She added
that I would be married again. This
saddened me, as I have kept my silver
wedding, and would be glad to celebrate
the golden or even diamond anniversary
of my nuptials.
True Indications oj my Disposition.—
She said I am "generous to a fault." I
am. I gave sixpence to a crossing sweeper
one Christmas Eve ten or eleven years
ago. That I am "almost too conscien-
tious." I am. The assessor of income
tax is entirely wrong, or nearly entirely
wrong, in the view he has taken for many
years past concerning my return. I am
"very fond of dress." I am. I have kept
a favourite frock coat in constant use for
the last ten years. I am very fond of it.
"When once I make up my mind to any-
thing, I do it." Absolutely correct. The
more so that I never make up my mind
about anything. If I did, of courso I
should do it.
Questionable indications.—My delineator
informed me that I was " cut out to be a
soldier." This may be so, but it is only
right to say that when I joined the Inns of
Court Rifle Volunteers I never succeeded
in getting my dismissal from drill. The
military evolution technically known as
"forming fours" was an insuperable
difficulty to my advancement. However,
if I had received rapid promotion and
had become Field-Marshal Commanding-in-
Chief, there is no knowing what I might
have done. I am very fair as a tactician
as may be gathered from the fact that I
am frequently successful in a game of
draughts. 1 am also a dangerous opponent
—when my player is not too strong—at
dominoes. On the other side, it is only
right to admit that I know very little of
chess, and am an unpopular partner at
bridge.
Final impression.—There is something
in it. I was led to this conclusion by the
palmist (who did not, however, pretend to
reveal the secrets of the future) informing
me that it was " highly probable that I
should some day become Lord Chancellor."
This has been my opinion for the last
thirty years—in fact, since the date of my
"call" supper. And that I have made con-
siderable progress in this direction may
be assumed by the layman. To my col-
leagues at the Bar I can adduce a few
facts in support of my contention. I may
mention for their information that during
last term I made no less than three appli-
cations—certainly in the same action, but
the action is one of very considerable
importance — to a Master in Chambers,
and already this term have been entrusted
with the responsible office of holding a
watching brief.
And with this observation I conclude
my opinion. My impression of palmistry
may be summed up in five words—there is
something in it.

THE FLIGHT OF FANCY.
I think the joke extremely good
And marvel at my buoyant mood;
The point is clear, the humour terse,
I '11 sketch it in an easy verse.
The joke is good; I think how Jones
Will greet it with his cheery tones:
I laugh to think how many times
Jones has exploded at my rhymes.
Still, as I think, the joke somehow
Less rich in humour seems to grow;
The point so clear, the wit so terse
Seems less adapted to a verse.
The subtle point so deftly made
Within my mind begins to fade.
The quaint allusions cease to lend
Charm to an unexpected end.
I take it from another view,
I turn it round—it will not do;
The parts I most had chuckled at
Appear now singularly flat.
Yet still the joke I ponder o'er,
Though now to mo a joke no more,
Though blurred by every changing
mood,—
And still I think the joke ivas good.
EXTRAORDINARY EFFECTS OF THE
FOG.
"Truth is stranger than fiction," and
especially strange are the truths re-
corded hereunder, and based upon ac-
counts which are but now beginning to
come in, relating to the late awful visita-
tion of fog. Amongst them we learn
that :—
The skipper of a cargo boat feeling
her way up the Thames was shot over-
board by the sudden blowing of the
syren. Of course, the unfortunate man
was drowned: this was a fog-horn—beg
pardon, fore-gone conclusion.
In the heavy murk of Regent Street,
one gentleman's hand was found in
another's watch-pocket. Questioned by
a constable, he said that he had not the
remotest notion how it got there. The
constable said that that was "too thin ";
and, subsequently, the magistrate said,
"three months."
One gentleman was actually obliged to
go to bed in his boots, as the fog made it
quite impossible for him to find his own
feet.
There have been several well authenti-
cated instances of men who—owing to
the thickness of the fog—actually an-
nexed their neighbours' drinks whilst
standing in Fleet Street bars.
Several curious mistakes have been
made at the clubs over umbrellas and
overcoats, all the more remarkable as in
nearly every instance members took new
articles, leaving behind them old and
worn-out ones.
Fog was responsible for a singular
mistake in the neighbourhood of Lancaster
Gate, where a person was seen to climb up
over the portico and enter a house by
the first-floor window. His subsequent
explanation to the policeman was that he
was under the impression that it was his
own house, and that, for the sake of
exercise, he was always in the ha bit of
entering in that way. Without going so
far as to reject this explanation, the
learned magistrate thought that during
a seven days' remand matters of interest
on the subject of this gentleman's ante-
cedents might possibly come to light, and
so, for the present, the case stands. The
police at large are earnestly hoping that
we may have no more serious visitations
of the fog iiend this side of Christmas.
"Aye, Aye, Sir !"—The announcement
that Anderson Critchett, the well-known
oculist, has recently received the honour
of knighthood is " a sight for sore eyes."
Sir Anderson, or rather Sir Andy, is in-
deed one of the best practical illustrat ions
of " Tho 'Andy Man" in his particular line
that Mr. Punch can call to mind. SoAfr.P.,
raising his glass to his eye, previous to
lowering it to his lips, says heartily,
"Congratulations to you, my dear' Sir' 1"

THE HERMIT OF SAINT
BOTJIN.
[" Saint Rouin, the place of pilgrimage in
Argonne, it without a hermit. The last of these
anchorites was not exactly an object of veneration
to the faithful of the neighbourhood. This old
Zouave was not averse to using bad language, or
to begging in the village and apostrophising in
lurid French mixed with Arabic Ihose who refused
bim alms. Moreover, he was rather too fond of the
bottle. On his d»ath the Bishop of Verdun deemed
it advisable not to nominate a successor."—Jiagatin
Pittoretque.]
To sit in solitary spot
With contemplative air,
This is the unexciting lot
That hermits love to bear,
And prayer
Should be their constant care.
But he was of another hue:
Your alms be would implore,
And if you offered him a sou
With oaths he asked for more.
OLor'!
How shockingly he swore!
Nor had lie that ascetic turn
A hermit ought to sport:
For alcohol his soul did yearn—
Beer, brandy, sherry, port.
In short
He worshipped every sort.
WTith many a pilgrim passing by
Was many a bottle cracked,
And many a double-seeing eye
This holy hermit blacked.
In fact
There's scarce a crime he lacked.
At last this anchorite became
Of nuisances the chief,
And -when he left his mortal frame
The sighs for him were brief.
Belief
Was felt instead of grief.
And now beside Saint Bouin fair
Good pilgrims feel no qualms
To see a drunken hermit there
Stretch forth his grimy palms
For alms
With oaths instead of psalms.
And in this tragic tale, I vow,
A moral one may see
For all who are good hermits now
Or ever hope to be—
i.e.
They ought to be T.T.
MR. PUNCH'S MUSEUM.
"Bill of Fare (from the Archives of a
London Restaurant.)" This quaint docu-
ment has been supposed by philologists to
be written in a kind of French. There
appears to have been a superstition of
some tenacity that dishes would taste
inadequately or indelicately if labelled
in the vulgar tongue. Thanks, however,
to the labours of the various Professors of
Cookery at the Universities of Peckham,
Joeburg, Toowoomba, Oklahoma and
Medicine Hat, the resources of the
Anglaustramericafrican language have
long been found equal to the task.
NOT THE FASHION IN NATA1.
TnERE was a young lady of Durban,
Who imported a Paris-made turban.
It was blue, green and red,
But the natives all said
That the style was remote and suburban.

A "SORT" OF INTERNICOTINE WAR.
(Telegrams from Our Special Fumiste at
the Front.)
Nov. 7.—Trouble has been brewing upon
the Guinea Gold Coast for several weeks
past. The Pigaden tribe left Somaliland
last September, under the leadership of
a new headman
(known, curiously
enough, by the
English title of
"Duke"), with
the avowed object
of raiding British
territory.
Nov. 8. —It has
now transpired
that quite a month
ago certain emis-
saries of the Piga-
dens in disguise
were especially
active in endeav-
ouring to win
adherents among
the more influen-
tial members of
tho British mer-
cantile community.
These enterprising
advance agents ap-
pear to have been
amply supplied
with funds, but
failed to shake the
loyalty of our com-
patriots.

lifa of the Pigadens

tier. His manner

lowers are openly

The Pigadens have
just forwarded an
ultimatum to the
effect that the Bri-
tish territory will
be invaded in force
unless the whole
plant, assets and
control of every
small Pro-Pigaden faction who advocate a

a "Jehad," or Holy War. This means
that they will fight to the death, and give
no quarter. Their flag is a crude combina-
tion of red and white bars with a number
of white patches on a blue ground in one
of the upper corners. It is reported that the

thing to be . . . (passage struck out by

without, however, specifying any " bag"
of prisoners. The

by both sides,

Imperialists are
fighting for inde-

kind, which oven

AN UNREAL CONVERSATION.
Recorded by Archie Williams.
Scene—Mr. A. J. Balfour's London house.
Tlie Right Honourable gentleman's bed-
room. Discovered, Mr. Balfour in
bed. To him enter A. W.
A. W. Good morning, Mr. Balfour. I
am very sorry indeed to find that you are
ill.
Mr. B. (yawning). On the contrary I'm
in the best of health. But I don't get up
so ridiculously early as some fellows. It's
only half past eleven now. What have
you come about? I hope you don't want
a literary pension from the Civil List.
One of those wretched things gave me an
immense amount of trouble some time ago.
A. W. No, thank you. I only wanted a
little chat on public affairs.
Mr. B. Oh, that's all right. Please
chat about anything you like, except golf.
Nothing annoys me more than a man
talking golf unless he understands it
perfectly. Some fellows are always talk-
ing golf. Besides, one must have some
recreation. That's why I devote part of
my leisure to statesmanship. It bores me
horribly, but it is a change from golf.
You won't mind if I finish this novel
while you 're chatting? It's one of Gyp's
last. How dreadfully poor her books have
been since she first dragged in politics!
She's really quite tedious now. What
wore you saying?
A. W. I wasn't saying anything. I was
delighted to hear your views on current
literature.
Mr. B. I'm glad you think the same.
And Bourget is so long-winded, and Zola
is still more long-winded and quite im-
possible with all his surgical horrors, and
Pierre Loti writes in newspapers, and
the brothers Margueritte bore one with
war news of 1870, still more like news-
papers, only old ones. Really I think I
shall have to try Marie Corelli.
A. W. When I came in, and saw you in
bed, I was afraid you were suffering from
vaccination. In fact, I hoped I should
hear your views on the "conscientious
objector." I believe you started that
name. (A pause.) Can he be asleep?
[Mr. Balfour's book falls with a crash
on the floor.
Mr. B. (starting up). What's that?
Oh, I beg your pardon! That's the worst
of reading in bed. One's almost sure to
fall asleep. It always seems so snug, but
it isn't really very comfortable after all.
If you lie on your back you can't see
properly, and the book slips forward on
your nose, and if you lie on your side
you get pins and needles in your arm. It
is difficult to get a really comfortable
position anywhere, isn't it? In the House
I put my feet on the table, but the edge
of that's very sharp against one's ankles.
We ought to have sofas, only the space is
so cramped. I '11 just ring for my man to
pick up that book. Oh, please don't!
You really are too kind. It's so difficult
to lean out of bed to pick up a book.
One's apt to fall out after it, and that
is so very uncomfortable. I'm afraid I
interrupted you.
A. W. I was only asking your views on
vaccination.
Mr. B. Ah, that's a thing I really know
nothing about. I believe there was some
talk about it some time ago. I never can
remember statistics and that sort of
thing. They bore me dreadfully. But
there's somebody called Bernard Shaw,
who wrote a book, or a treatise, or some-
thing on the subject, called Anns and the
Man. That ought to tell you all about it.
I have an idea ho considers himself an
expert on the subject. Come to that,
why not consult your own doctor? I've
only one more page left.
A. W. (tvith hesitation). If it is not
asking you to reveal state secrets I should
be so glad if you could give me any idea of
the character of the mysterious informa-
tion about the war which was hinted at
by Lord Salisbury at the Guildhall. But
please don't let me appear inquisitive.
In fact, in reference to the situation in
South Africa, you might prefer to give
me your private opinion in vague terms.
Mr. B. (flinging the book on the floor).
Worse and wrorse!
A. W. (excitedly) What? You don't mean
to say it's as bad as that? And everyone
hoping it was getting near the end.
Mr. B. It's finished, thank goodness!
A. W. (indignantly). How can you say
that? It's what you've been saying all
along. Really, Mr. Balfour, you must
excuse me if I say that something ought
to be done.
Mr. B. (drowsily). Done, did you say?
What can be done?
A. W. (more indignantly.) You ask me
that? How on earth should I know? It's
as bad as that senseless—excuse me, that
strange remark about the Man in the
Street. If you and the others don't
know what to do, with all the wonderful
secret information you have, or ought to
have, how can I? Really, I must say there
never can have been a more absent-minded
collection of dreamers. But it's no use
talking, there must be something (empliati-
cally) to be done.
Mr. B. (waking up with a start). There!
you said it again. But what can be done?
The only way is not to bother about such
tedious twaddle.
A. W. (still more indignantly). Tedious
twaddle, you call it? Really, Mr. Bal-
four, it is difficult to find words to express
what I think.
Mr. B. Oh, come now, it's not so bad
as that. She's a clever woman, only she
has written less well since she thought
she was carried off to the suburbs of Paris,
and munched that carrot out in the fields.
A. TV. What woman? What carrot?
Mr. B. Why, GYP, of course.

When the day is dark and dreary,
And my heart is worn and weary,
Then I fumble in my dress about the rear,
Till I find the cunning pocket
Whence I take this crystal locket,
And I gaze on Padkrewski's precious tear.
Women friends to whom I've shown it
Say they'd give tlie world to own it,
And they offer me the ransom of a peer—
Which they'd give with satisfaction
For a teeny weeny fraction
Of my master Paderewski's precious tear.
And they come in hundreds thronging,
And they gaze with eyes of longing
On the relic in its crystal bright and clear;
But although they madly covet,
Far too dearly do I love it
To distribute Paderewski's precious tear.
For I watched it slowly straying
DowTn his nose as he was playing,
And I vowed a vow 'twixt trembling hope
and fear—
If I caught it I would perish
Ere I ever ceased to cherish
In its crystal Paderewski's precious tear.
So when Philistines unsouly
Come and mock my relic holy
With a vulgar jest and idiotic sneer,
Then again I seek the pocket
And restore the crystal locket
Which contains my Paderewski's precious
tear.

JACOB AND HIS MASTER.
Part I.
The dreadful and dreaded funeral ceremony was at an end;
the friends and relatives of the deceased—distant relatives,
most of them, who had come from a distance—were dispersing;
the will, which disposed of a most exiguous estate, had been
duly read; the chief mourner, accompanied by the only friend
left to him in the wide world, slipped softly out of the grim,
groy house and sat himself down on the outskirts of an adjoin-
ing pine-copse to think things over. A mournful little chief
mourner he was (though with a stout heart beneath his waistcoat
and a sensible head under his cap), and his only friend, pressed
close to him by an encircling arm, knew better than to attempt
boisterous consolation. Even in those early days of excitable
puppyhood that true and shaggy friend of his had grave moods,
as well as profound instincts. Airdale terriers, indeed, are
almost always prone to contemplate life in its more serious
aspects.
BOB Cracroft'S life, as it presented itself to him on that
windy March afternoon, offered a picture, present and future,
which looked serious enough. He had been very fond of his
father, who had met with instantaneous death in the hunting-
field only a few days before, and whose obsequies he had been
summoned by telegraph to attend—so fond, that he had to bite
his lips and postpone reflections upon that subject until friendly
darkness and bed-time should supervene. He wished just now
to bring his mind, if he could, to bear upon the question of
what was going to become of him. To this he had been unable
to disentangle any lucid reply from the puzzling phraseology of
the legal document which had been recited in his presence;
only he had gathered from sundry whispered remarks that there
would be very little money for him and no home. Something had
been audibly said about the necessity of letting Kirkhall, and the
probable difficulty of discovering a tenant for the place. Poor
little grey Kirkhall 1—wild and forbidding on its bleak hillside,
under the low northern sky, yet dear from its association with
many happy holidays—small likelihood, in truth, was there of
eager competition for such a residence. The thought might not
have been wholly discomforting, had Kirkhall been Bob's own
property ; but that, he supposed, could not be the case.
That, however, was the case; and his uncle, Theodore
Cracropt, having descried him from the dining-room window, was
even now stepping lightly across the grass to inform him that he
was, amongst other things, a landowner in statu pupillari.
This tall, slim, carefully-attired gentleman, with whom his elder
brother, a man wholly addicted to field sports, had never cared
to maintain close relations, was known to Bob only by name
and by vague, unflattering reputation. In circles less rustic
Theodore Cracroft enjoyed some considerable reputation as a
rising barrister and a not ungraceful contributor to contempor-
ary literature. If at that particular moment he looked a little
cross and impatient, excuses must be made for him. Who, after
a long journey into stern, northern wilds, terminating with a
funeral and with the agreeable discovery that he has been
constituted sole guardian of an ill-provided-for orphan, can be
expected to look pleased? But Theodore endeavoured to make
the best of a bad job. He said, in a tone of kindly remon-
strance:
"My dear boy, this really isn't weather for sitting out of
doors. Jump up before the east wind freezes the marrow of
your bones 1"
BOB rose slowly. "I don't mind it, thanks," he answered;
"I rather like it."
"Do you indeed? I wiBh I did! Is that queer-looking
mongrel yours?"
Bob was too much shocked and taken aback to make any
immediate reply. That that flat head, that long muzzle, that
perfect blue-grey and tan coat, those strong, straight legs and
round feet should be pronounced the attributes of a "queer-
looking mongrel" was indeed a startling revelation of
ignorance I The only rejoinder that could be made was, "I
suppose you don't know much about Airdales."
"Absolutely nothing," Mr. Cracroft confessed, good-
humouredly enough. "If he is a prize specimen of the breed,
1 beg to offer him my apologies. What do you call him?"
"Jacob Faithful," answered the boy, adding explanatorily:
"I named him after a favourite character of mine in a book."
"Oh, yes," said the other, laughing. "I am acquainted
with the book. One has heard of Captain Marry at, though
one isn't familiar with the points of an Airdale. I'm glad you
have a liking for sea stories; you can't do better than stick
to the sea—can't do better!"
What he meant was, that the boy could not do better than
adopt a profession which would render him as little as possible
of a nuisance to his guardian. "But," he resumed, pinching
his chin meditatively, "I presume that you won't be allowed
to take Mr. Jacob Faithful back to the Britannia with you?"
"Oh, no," answered Bob, with a sorrowful shake of the
head ; " that isn't allowed."
f'H'm!—and as your home henceforth, during the holidays,
will have to be my London chambers"
"Am I to live with you, Sir 1" asked the boy quickly.
THEODORE responded by a shrug of the shoulders, which
seemed to imply pretty plainly that the arrangement was not
one of his seeking. He laid-bare the situation in a few con.
cise sentences. "Your poor father seems, unfortunately, to
have lived for many years beyond the limits of his small in-
come. He has left some money—just enough, perhaps, to
defray the expenses of your education and give you a start in
life. As for this modest estate, which is to be held in trust
for you until you come of age, I am afraid it is likely to cost
all that it will bring in. Well, one must take things as they
come. I don't suppose you will like London at first; but, in
the ordinary course of matters, you will be going to sea before
very long."
"What about Jake, though?" Bob anxiously inquired.
"Oh, Jacob Faithful, eh? Well—upon my word, I hardly
know"
He was almost inclined to say that he .would take charge of
the dog, whose rough head he stooped down to pat; but, un-
luckily, Jacob, who, for all his tact and wisdom, was still very
young, misinterpreted this advance and jumped to unwarranted
conclusions. He had, of course, heard his name, and had very
likely divined that his fate was under discussion: he settled it
by flinging himself impulsively upon the stranger and barking
aloud, as who should say, "1 thank you, Sir; you are a better
fellow than I took you for, after all!"
"Get down, you brute!" called out Mr. Cracroft, stepping
back and brushing the imprint of muddy paws off his black
coat. To the boy he said, "Dogs are out of the question in
London, you know—a burden to themselves and everybody else.
You will have to part with this one, I'm afraid."
"He's an awfully obedient dog," Bob remarked, with the air
of one who merely states a fact and asks no favour.
"I doubt whether I should find him so. Besides, I couldn't
spare time to give him the exercise necessary to keep him in
health. There really isn't room for a dog in my very occupied
life."
"I suppose," said Bob, "hecouldn't be left here, could he?"
"Not very well; we hope to let the house, you see. You had
better, I should say, present Jacob Faithful to somebody in the
neighbourhood who will be kind to him."
"All right," answered the boy.
He himself was obedient and accustomed to discipline: also
he was proud and a bit of a stoic: furthermore, he had taken
stock of his guardian, who struck him as ill-adapted to exercise
control over a high-spirited animal. THEODORE CRACROFT,
pleased and somewhat surprised by Bob's ready submission,
patted him on the shoulder, said a few words which were

intended to be approving and encouraging, mentioned that they
would both have to leave on the morrow, and presently retired
into the house. He must write some letters before the post
went out, he remarked—perhaps as a hint that he did not wish
to be disturbed.
Bob was innocent of any desire to intrude upon his guardian,
whose back he was relieved to see. He consulted the silver
watch which his father had given him on his last birthday,
found that there would be plenty of time to walk over to
Horsley Park upon an errand which had become imperative, and
started across the fields towards his destination with plodding
grounds would be a rare bit of luck, and he was conscious of
not being at present in luck's way. Luck, however, is of all
phenomena the most capricious, and he had not trudged many
yards along one of the shrubberies which surrounded the
imposing white mansion before he found himself face to face
with Phyllis Buncombe herself, unattended (oh, joy !) by the
formidable German lady whose duty it was to keep a vigilant
eye upon her movements.
"Bob !" exclaimed the little girl, throwing out both her hands
towards him with an impulsive gesture of pity and sympathy;
"I was just thinking about you. I—I'm so dreadfully sorry 1"

steps and a rather heavy heart, Jacob Faithful trotting quietly
at his heels.
"Hold up, Jacob," he said presently; "don't be dismal, old
man. It's going to be all right for you."
So Jacob ranged on ahead, affecting an access of high spirits
and pursuing invisible rabbits. It was quite true that he was
a very obedient dog.
Horsley Park, the residence of Mr. Duncombe, M.P., was
situated at a distance of some four miles from Kirkhall as the
crow flies. Within an hour Bob had reached the confines of the
extensive gardens and, dropping his elbows uponan iron railing
which separated these from the park, paused to consider. He
did not very much want to present himself at the front door
and be stared at by the butler and a couple of cheeky footmen;
but that, in all probability, was what he would have to do. To
come across Phyllis and her governess somewhere in the
The boy nodded, tightened the set of his mouth and grasped
the little hands extended to him in his own rather big and red
ones. He understood, and he was grateful; but there are subjects
which cannot bo talked about without danger of incurring
personal disgrace. So all he said was:
"I thought I would just come up and see if you were any-
where about. I want you to do me a favour, if you will."
"Oh, but of course I will do anything I can for you, Bob—
anything !" the girl cried, with shining eyes.
She was a very pretty little girl, and her grey eyes were most
pleasant to look upon. Bob thought so, and had alwaysthought
so; although it had never before been his privilege to gaze into
them at such close quarters, for Miss PHYLLIS knew how to keep
admirers in their proper place. Just then, no doubt, she was
moved by compassion, and willing, perhaps, to unbend to an
extent of which no gentleman ought to take advantage.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [November 20, 1901.
Realising this, Bob relinquished her hands, sighed and went on:
"It's only about Jake. Will you have hiui? He's no trouble
in the house, and he never fights unless he's attacked. He
ought to have bones sometimes for the sake of his teeth; but I
wouldn't give him any meat, if I were you. You '11 find him
awfully affectionate."
"You are never going to part with Jacob!" exclaimed the
girl.
"Well, I must, you see. I'm under orders from an uncle of
mine who lives in London, and who isn't particularly fond of
dogs. And I don't know," added Bob meditatively, "that I
should care about trusting him with a dog even if he was. Now
you do know a well-bred one from a mongrel; so I should feel a
lot happier if Jake were yours."
"Jake will never be anybody's but yours," Miss Phyllis
declared; "but I'll take care of him for you—oh, I'll take
the greatest care of him !—until you have a home of your own
again and send for him."
Jacob, who had seated him-
self between the couple, and
had been turning his head from
one to the other during the
above dialogue, looked wist-
fully up at her. She stooped
and kissed him, receiving a
huge lick in return. Bob also
kissed the dog: if he selected
the same spot for his salute as
had been hallowed by the touch
of Phyllis's lips, that may have
been a mere coincidence. At
any rate, the gruff, rather husky
accents in which he presently
addressed her were suggestive
of no silly sentimentality.
"I suppose you haven't got
such a thing as a pair of scissors
about you, have you?"
Phyllis was sorry that she
had not.
"Oh, well, never mind 1 I'll
manage it with my knife. I
only wanted a bit of the old
chap's hair, in case I shouldn't
ever see him again."
He managed it with his knife
—which was a blunt one—while
Jacob, without a whimperof re-
monstrance, wagged his stump
of a tail up and down. One of
Jacob's idiosyncrasies (unique in the experience of the present
historian) was that he always wagged his tail perpendicularly,
instead of horizontally. This, somehow or other, lent a certain
dignity to the demonstration and seemed to accord with the
serious trend of his character. It was with his honest, anxious,
yellowish eyes that ho was wont to smile, and the smile so
plainly visible therein now was full of anxiety. Too full of it
to be contemplated by Bob, who hastily averted his head and
turned once more to the little girl.
"I say," he began.
"Well," she returned, "what do you say 1"
"I suppose you wouldn't—you'll think me no end of an ass,
I expect—but, might I have a bit of yours too?"
"A bit of what?" Phyllis innocently inquired; though she
know well enough.
"You 've got a tremendous lot of it, you know," Bob urged;
"you wouldn't miss just a scrap of it off the ends."
She had, indeed, a tremendous lot of it for her ago; it fell
in a thick golden-bronze shower below her waist, and often,
while it was being combed, she lamented its abnormal density.
Yet she could not, even to please a poor boy who had just lost
his father and was about to lose his dog, make the implored
sacrifice without a little more pressure. Although she was
only fourteen, she was not ignorant of the powers and prero-
gatives which are the birthrights of her sex.
"Oh, Bobby," she expostulated laughingly, "don't be ridi-
culous!"
Bob could not bear to be called Bobby, and was not fond of
being thought ridiculous; but, as he wanted that lock of hair
rather badly, he had the courage to persist. After some further
debate, he carried his point; the blunt instrument was once
more called into requisition and a treasure, which was destined
to remain with him for many years to come, was safely stowed
away in his waistcoat pocket. Then, in answer to Phyllis'S
queries, he drew a succinct anticipatory sketch of his coming
career, so far as it admitted of forecast. In about eighteen
months he would pass out of the Britannia—as midshipman, he
hoped—and would at once proceed to sea. He would, he said,
have "precious little to live

QUITE THE RIGHT SORT OF LINK-BOY
upon" beyond his pay; but
sooner or later a big war was
bound to come and bring rapid
promotion to those who survived
it. Anyhow, there were always
little wars going on, and in these
a Naval Brigade was always
engaged. With ordinary luck,
a fellow might expect to be
posted before his beard was
grey, and then"
"What then?" Phyllis
inquired.
"Then," answered the boy,
with determination, "I shall
settle down at Kirkhall. That
is, of course, between my
commands.''
"It seems rather a long time
to wait," observed Phyllis pen-
sively. "Let me see ; you are
fifteen now "—she began check-
ing off the decades on her fingers
—'' twenty - five, thirty - five,
forty-five—thirty years! Jacob
won't be here when you come
back to live at Kirkhall."
"No, nor you either," re-
turned Bob sadly. "Well, it
can't be helped. Don't forget
a fellow, that's all!"
She gave him an unhesitating promise that she would never
do that; she even (but this is a great secret) bestowed upon
him at the last moment an intoxicating pledge of remembrance
which went near to depriving him of his wits. However, he
had presence of mind enough to return it with interest. Then
he took the dog's chin in his hand and said, in a hoarse, but
steady voice:
"Jacob Faithful, this is your mistress. You are going to live
with her now; you don't belong to me any inoro. Be a good
dog, and stay where you are. Goodbye, dear old chap—
goodbye!"
Bob left rather abruptly, without once looking back; the
laurels and the rhododendrons soon concealed him from view,
and Jacob made no attempt to follow him.
Jacob, fully realising the situation, remained squatted upon
his haunches, threw up his nose and gave one long, low moan;
while the little girl, flinging herself upon her knees beside
him, pressed him to her heart and wept aloud.

Weather of the most varied description

Thus, those who enjoy a warm, genial air,
generally obtain their desire—often accom-
panied by a strong, life-giving gale: later
in the day quite a St. Moritz turn is
taken by the weather: and those who like
a cold frosty temperature — coupled in
most cases with a thick fog—can revel in
the atmospheric conditions offered them.
The inhabitants have a never-failing source
of amusement here in the constant change
from summer to winter clothing, necessi-
tated by the charming inconsistency of

forming at the Town Hall, but ceased

And so your neighbour charmed you? Tis a type

And dowered with every solid bridal grace
Good to restore the fortunes of a lino
Noble in name but out at elbow-joint,
Groggy o' thews, thin-marrowed, run to seed
For lack of lusty graft on senile stock,
Yet keeping what of wit sufficed to know
The price of antique curios cornered tight,
Intrinsic worth of crusted quarterings,
And what the legend's tag was like to fetch—
How goes it ?" Foy et toy "—old Norman style.
And so you found her charming? What! I'm wrong?
'Twas not the Countess pleased your sense of style,
But just your other neighbour? Why, my friend,
That was the governess, called at sudden pinch
From meal i 'th' nursery regions—tea and eggs—
To supplement our numbers, thirteen else.
O but of course a lady, need I say?
A thing imperative for the children's sake,
Who ask correction, being apt to lean
Too much for speech and manners on the maids.
Good family—goes back, I understand,
Five hundred years or more—stout yeoman stuff.
Had chance of title, but declined the same
On ground of being unversed in brewers' ways;
Nay, more, concealed the offer so refused,
A case of false pride, happily rare enough
In business circles. Brief, their fortunes fell

On indigence, the genteel-piteous kind,
Bringing the eldest daughter down to this,
A post of flve-and-forty pound a year
With beer-allowance. Sweaters' wage, you '11 say,
And scarce a third of salary paid my cook?
Why, there I'm with you, were I free to waive
What rules, imposed by economic law,
Provide a check for thoughtless altruism,
Which else had rashly pauperised the girl
Or spoilt the market-rates for poorer men.
But to resume our Countess. 'Tis a type

In whose "combine" with yonder belted Earl
You have a sign o' th' times who runs may read;

In old nobility's veins; fresh Phoenix-flights
Of fowl revived—the Eastern fable serves—
By breath o' th' spirit o' commerce blown on ash.
Frankly it is a patriot's part they play,
Our merchant^princes, who restore the breed
By taking noblemen for sons-in-law!
How else re-galvanise the Upper House
Closed, this long while, against commercial claims,
Letting what prime financiers prop the state
Go unennobled, save by Nature's work?
Ay, there's the price wo placid Tories pay,
And something too serenely, through the nose,
For huge majorities, not greatly prone

By just what manner o' process they arrived.

Or less the loyalist you know mo for,
Almost I might be moved to shift my flag
Into the camp of men so deep in need,
The battlements they storm, so steep to win,
And, being narrowly won, so hard to hold,
They could not well afford to disallow
Its due equivalent to service done!

And your thunderbolts to forge, a la Labby and Lloyd-George,
against the Government;
Or, if it is your glory to be rated as a Tory, I will make it clear
and plain
That the one chance of salvation for the British, as a nation,
is in Joseph Chamberlain.
And every one will say,
As you walk your lucid way,
"If he can see these things so well, which are not so clear
to me,
Why, ,what"a most astonishingly great young man this great
young man must be!"

The Qeneiul. "And what are 'iou going to be when you grow up, young man?'
Bobbie. "Well, I can't quite make up my mind. I don't know which would be nicest—a soldier, like you, or a
SAILOR, LIKE Mu. SuiTHERS."
PATTERING FEET.
Something's afoot; beware, beware!
Something is climbing the bedroom stair.
"With here a stumble and there a slip,
Into the passage—trip, trip, trip.
Sharp little footfalls queer and quick,
Never a careful step they pick.
Quaintly marking a morning song,
Hurry-scurry they rush along.
Tripping bright on the passage floor,
Up they come to your bedroom door.
Never was music half so sweet
As the pit-a-pat patter of tiny feet.
Dear little voices, high and clear,
Ring like a bell in the sleeper's ear.
Small hands pluck at his touzled head,
"Daddy, oh Daddy, get out of bed!"
Keeping the rules—it's all a game—
Out they patter as in they came,
But somehow the song moves rather slow,
As down the passage and off they go.
And it's oh for the yoars that have passed away,
And the feet that pattered at break of day.
Now they are heavily booted feet,
And they tramp and stamp in the busy street.
And some of them seemed to tire of fun,
So they wandered away till they met the sun;
But he sends them sliding along his beams,
To patter again in your morning dreams.
"HOOD'S OWN" AT THE SAVOY.
Neither lb and Lit tle Christina—in which title the first name
is not, we believe, a familiar abbreviation of "IB9EN"—nor
The Willow Pattern, both by Captain Basil Hood, have we, as
yet, seen at the Savoy; only, on reading a notice of the latter
trifle in The Times, -where the writer referred to A Tale of Old
China, as played by the German Reed's Company years ago at
the Gallery of Illustration, it occurred to the present reader
and writer, " two single gentlemen rolled into one," that The
Willow Pattern had served ALBERT SMITH and collaborateurs
very many years ago as the subject for an excellent extrava-
ganza at the Haymarket, with a full description of action as
represented on the plate itself, which was painted on the " act
drop," and spoken by one of the authors (William Brouoh it
might havo been), who stood in front, as a lecturer with a
wand, pointing out the figures and situations as portrayed on
the plate, and identifying them with what the audience would
see when the curtain should rise and the action should com-
mence. There has been quite a market for Old China recently
in tho way of musical pieces, ballets, and so forth; perhaps
the above-mentioned old extravaganza, "served up " with new
music and modern improvements in costumes and scenery,
might yet serve the turn of some enterprising manager.
Exercise recommended to Thix Persons in order to achieve
Corpulence.—Select a nice soft grass-plat. Then, being quite
thin, jump up in the air and let yourself fall, not on your feet of
course. The thinnest man, whohascarefullyfollowedthisadvice,
will at the very second of his descent discover that he tuts
come doivn plump on the grass. Nothing further is required.

[" Madame Kaissavow, who died lately in St.
Petersburg, has left behind an immense library
of a curiously unique character. It consists of
nearly 18,000 volumes, and every work in the

She would never permit any book from a mascu-

No SHAKSPEARE here hath quibbled
In jests best left unsaid;
No Congreve waxes ribald
In plays that can't be read:
But here the heart may gladden
The hours that such would sadden
"With Annie Swan, Miss Braddon
And Mrs. Ward instead.
No wild Byronic passion
In this chaste study rings;
No Keats in dubious fashion
Proclaimeth dubious things;
Yet need we not man's pity,
For hark, how sweetly pretty
The pure and pious ditty
That holy Hemans sings!
With flrinness all unyielding
Far from our shelves we spurn
The wicked works of Fielding.
Swift, Richardson and Sterne.
No gorged digestion sickens
On Thackeray or Dickens;
To Mother Carey's chickens
For lighter food we turn.
Consistent still we banish
Man-writers of to-day;
Q., Hope and Kipling vanish
Far from our shelves away;
For wherefore should we need a
Pett-Ridge while we can read a
Corelli, Grand, or Otida,
A Gyp or Maxwell Gray '>.
Here in this haunt of virtue,
Here in this Vestal shrine,
No work of man shall hurt you
With humour masculine:
This pure and chaste collection
Owes all its sweet perfection
And virtuous complexion
To fingers feminine.
ATHENS v. CORINTH.
[The Daily Expresi publishes an Athens tele
gram stating that "the Minister of Instruction
will submit a Bill to the Chamber of Deputies,
making compulsory in Greek schools the game of
cricket, which he claims to be an ancient Greek
game." The following extract from n recently-
discovered Greek MS. seems to substantiate this
view.]
"... PENTHEL'S therefore, the egg of a
waterfowl having been secured ('), came
back into the building, the crowd indeed
shouting, not as those who grant applause,
but as making ridicule. Next in turn it
behoved Lysias, good at shaking trees (J),
to sally forth. First then he, his armour
fastened about his Mini s, made supplica-
tion to the gods, saying: 'Grant, O ye
Gods! that ClIIRON, whose gentle casting
of the ball is no less dear to me than
honey of Hymettus, be not compelled to
cease from his task, and let the lingers of
those situated in rural districts be well-
spread with rich butter.'(s) So saying,
he ceased; and, having sacrificed a cock
and a sheep, sped forth into the midst of
the field.
"Forthwith then CHIRON, good at frac-
turing the lower limbs ('), seized the ball
and propelled it dexterously. It com-
ing, Lysias smote, not gently indeed,
but with the utmost force. As a bird in
early morning soars gladly far above the
heads of men, not otherwise the ball,
Lysias having struck, sought the upper
air. Awaiting its return stood a man of
Athens, situated in the lengthy pas-
turage(5), his hands outspread. But him
the ball eluded, falling headlong to the
earth; cries of derision also being uttered
by the spectators. And the leader of
the Athenians, grieved as to his dear
heart, spake winged words, saying,
'Your clumsiness is excessively annoy-
ing.'(") But the other answered that he
was not to blame, Phoebus Apollo having
blinded his eyes. Then Chiron once more
propelling the ball, it struck Lysias on
the elbow, passing thence into the hands
of the guardian of the gate ('). He,
turning about to the arbitrator, good at
judgments, cried aloud: 'Publish unto
us, O arbitrator, thine opinion.' Now
the arbitrator, himself an Athenian,
chanced to have a wager of several
drachmfe on the contest. Wherefore he
replied: 'O men and citizens, very
much especially indeed it befits that
Lysias should depart.' Lysias, there-
fore, his heart being grieved, went back
into the building; and then, pointing
to the arbitrator, be said to his com-
panions "(8)
Notes by our Classical Editor.
(') An obscure phrase. PoffeniVorf plausibly
conjectures that the egg was taken as refreshment
by one of the protagonists.
O Another difficult sentence. Literally, it means
"a skilful willow-handler," but this seems point-
less.
Lit. "The fingers of the men in the country"
—apparently a pious prayer for the agricultural
population of the neighbourhood.
(') Lit. "skilled at leg-breaking." Poffex-
doei' traces the epithet tc the speed with which
Chiron could throw the ball. But Lvsias ((/.
supra) speaks of him as casting it " gently."
(*) Some scholars translate: "in the long field."
My rendering, I think, is more poetic.
(*) I have ventured thus briefly to paraphrase
a vituperative speech of considerable length.
I (7) A difficult sentence. How could the ball
! travel from Lvsias' elbow all the way to the
| keeper of the gate, or wicket? POFFENDOEF
conjectures, rather inanely, that the gate was in
the centre of the field.
(*) Out of regard for the feelings of my readers,
T cannot translate the passage which follows
I A. C D.
N PRAISE OF THE FOURTH ESTATE.
England, when your star grows dim,
And when troubles gather round.
When about you, fierce and " slim,"
Cruel enemies abound—
Nought their onset need affect you,
With your " Dailies " to protect you.
What though Premiers waver still,
And your ministers prove frail;
Though your statesmen lose their skill,
Or in times of peril fail ?—
Chiding, teaching, prosing, warning,
You have " leaders " every morning.
If red tape the soldier clogs;
At a pace that none may stop
If the army, neck and crop,
Daily rushes to the dogs—
Diagnoses analytic
Gives " Our Military Critic."
Then if crimes your peace should vex—
Scatheless if the culprit roams—
Mysteries that would perplex
Scotland Yard or Sherlock Holmes
Yield their key to one still greater—
"Our own Crime Investigator."
So, though army and police
Kail you in your hour of need,
Let your sad forebodings cease.
Public, for you need not heed
Periods of storm and stress
While you have a Daily Press.

SCENE—The Library at Devonshire House.
Discovered, the Duke of DEVONSHIRE,
asleep in an easy chair. Enter A. W.
A. W. 1 'in very much obliged to your
Grace Why, here's another sleeper!
Ahem!
The Duke (without opening his eyes).
What \s won?
A. W. (aside). He must think I'm a
pupil-teacher, coming to be examined.
(Loudly.) One is a cardinal number.
The Duke. You needn't shout. Never
heard of Cardinal Number. Funny name
for a horse! Some outsider. (Ope?i3 his
eyes.) Hullo, who are you V
A. W. Your Grace was kind enough to
give me an appointment for a little con-
versation.
The Duke. I remember. You don't
happen to know the name of the winner,
do you? By tho way, are you fond of
racing? Keep any horses?
A. IV. That is beyond the dreams of
literature. Only a publisher or a theatrical
manager could run to that. A popular
novelist or dramatist hardly could. Even
the author of Lord Que.x
77i<; Duke. That's one of mine.
A. W. Excuse me, I think it's PlNERO'S.
The Duke. You 're quite mistaken. Lord
Quex is a horse of mine.
A. W. Oh, indeed! I meant the play.
I must confess I know nothing of r.tcing.

Spendthrift Kephew. "I didn't know you ever drove one, Uncle!"
The Duke. My goodness! How do you
amuse yourself?
A. TV*. I get along somehow. I occupy
myself with books.
The Duke (suddenly sitting bolt upright).
You don't mean to say you 're a bookie?
And yet you know nothing nbout racing?
A. W. Nor do 1. I mean reading and
studying.
The Duke. Oh lord! A sort of school-
master. Not Board School, I hope?
A. W. Oh no! Talking of amusement,
might I ask what your Grace is most fond
of doing?
The Duke. Nothing.
A. W. I mean, what is your favourite
recreation?
The Duke. I've told you. Doing nothing.
A. W. Ah, I understand! Naturally a
Minister, weighed down with the cares of
office and all the responsibilities of this
vast empire, must at times have complete
repose. He cannot have the physical
strength to devote himself without inter-
mission to the intellectual advancement of
the human race
The Duke (sleepily). Eh? At Nottingham
or Leicester?
A. W. Excuse me, I don't think any of
the Ministers live at either of those
places. Nor, as 1 was saying, can he give
up every moment of his life even to those
mighty schemes, those grand national
ideals
Tlie Duke (opening his eyes). What? The
Orand National isn't now! It's in March!
A. W. What has marching to do with it?
Oh, your Grace is thinking of military
progress. Well, so far, the only thing
altered is the soldier's head-dress. It's
not beautiful, but perhaps why, he's
asleep !—(loudly)—perhaps it's a handy
cap.
The Duke (drowsily). Manchester Handi-
cap? You're thinking of my Trans-
parency.
jf^A. _W. (confused). Your Transparency?
Is that a Chinese title?
The Duke (almost asleep). Or else—oh,
I'am sleepy! Or else Baldoyle, as they
said in some—some—some papers. [Nods.
A. H*. Boiled oil. What a horrible idea!
Is it a Chinese torture? Talking of China,
do you think the Yang-tse-Kiang arrange-
ment will open up a new market?
The Duke (thoroughly aroused). Eh?
Newmarket? Do you know it? Jolly
place, isn't it? I go there whenever I
can. Never feel so well anywhere. So
different to London, where you never see
a race-horse. Funny place, London! I
suppose it's full of schoolmasters like you.
A. W. 1 'm not a schoolmaster.
The Duke. Why, you said you studied
books, so 1 thought you must be. Some-
times I go to the Education Department.
Bores me awfully. They 're all school-
masters. Don't know a horse from a
motor car. I can't ever understand what
they 're talking about.
A. W. That reminds me your Grace is
President of the Board of Education.
The Duke. Dear me, I believe I am!
Now you mention it I remember something
of the sort. But I know nothing about it
at all. Never understand a word anybody
says on the subject. That's a very good
reason why I never say a word about it
myself. Perfect gibberish to me. But I
wish you wouldn't make me talk so much.
I'm supposed to be having a rest.
A. W, I beg your pardon. I had hoped
to 11 nd you primed to the finger-tips.
The Duke (drowsily). Tips? Ah now-, if
you were a racing man, you might be able
to give me some.
A. IV*. What sort of sum? I was always
bad at arithmetic. I'm not like your
Grace's subordinates in the Board Schools.
The Duke. Do they bet? If so, you in
proportion
A. IV*. In proportion? Well, let us say,
as ten is to one, so is
The Duke. If that was the betting, I
hope you put your money on another
horse. But, 1 say, do finish your ques-
tions as soon as you can. I'm awfully
tired. I shall get no sleep this morning.
A. W. Well, as to the war, if you could
give me your views •
The Duke. I haven't any.
A. W. I mean, if you have studied
The Duke. I don't study.
A. H*. Well, let's say your opinion
The Duke. I never have one.
A. \V. Dear, dear! Don't you know
what the other Ministers think?
The Duke. Not I.
A. W. Or what is to be done?
The Duke. I haven't the faintest idea.
A. IV". Might 1 venture to ask what
induced you to become a Minister?
The Duke. I'm sure I don't know. [ Nods.
A. W. Aren't you all trembling at the
thought of Lord Kosf.bery smashing you
at Derby, or somewhere in that county,
next month?
The Duke (hardly awake). ROSEBBRY?
Try for the Derby again? Possibly. But
that's—that's—that 's not for six months.
Good-bye. [Falls asleep. Exit A. W.

SUCCESSFUL SOCIETY;
Or, What the Future has in store.
["The successful society of the future will depend in the main on an
intelligent, scientific middle-class, strenuoHS, efficient, serious, and highly
educated. Aristocracy and plutocracy there will still be, but since in the
scientific states of the future training and efficiency will count for everything,
those who rely on money and birth cannot play the part that they played in
simpler organisations. They will tend more and more to supply the decorative,
non-efficient side of life, unless, indeed, luxury and ease spoil them for any
serious purpose whatever."—Popular Evening Paper.]
The scene is at the house of CUTPRISE, Chief Director of the
Tinned Tomato Trust. The room is severely and uncomfort-
ably furnished. Books, official documents, mechanical
appliances and nerve tonics are conspicuous objets d'art.
An air of restlessness, seriousness, business and electricity
hangs pall-like over everything. In the background are open
folding-doors. Within is seen a sumptuous office about which
highly-educated and gloomy officials flit. In front of a fire-
place, in a big armchair, is seated Thomasine, a pale, nervous
girl. She is in out-door costume and pince-nez. Enter from
office, Cutprise, o lean, yelloiv-faced, weak-eyed, intelligent,
scientific, strenuous, efficient, serious and highly-educated
automaton of the middle - class. Tlie folding-doors close.
Thomasine rises wearily and gives him a limp hand, which
Cutprisk takes without emotion.
Cutprise (in business-like tones). And you are to give me your
answer to-day?
1'homasine. Yes, before I go.
[Casts furtive glance at folding-doors.
Cut. You had no ulterior motive in coming here?
Thorn. What motive should 1 have?
Cut. (puzzled). I hardly know. Yet—business success has
taught me that human nature is subject to fluctuation. I
want to guard against a slump. If I thought that you
Thorn. Why these suspicions? The sexes are equal. Two
can suspect.
Cut. True. Forgive me if I appear a little strenuous. (Goes to
fire and speaks into it.) From every point of view our marriage
would be a thoroughly sound transaction. We are both middle
class and leaders of society. Intelligent enough to know that
love is not a practical asset of every-day life, and sufficiently
serious and sensible to desire above all tilings—(repeats
emp)uitically)—above all things, I say, worldly success and a
premier position in society. (Uirl winces.) 1 began, as you know,
as a vendor of ha'penny papers in the gutters, but by indomitable
push I got on and on, until now—see (waves his luiml round room).
I determined 1 would win for myself a place in successful society.
I have done it; but one false step, even now, would send me
down into the submerged circles of the decorative aristocrat or
the non-efficient plutocrat. And your case?
Thorn. Yes, substantially, mine is the same. The terrible
beginning at the hairpin factory; toil, night and day, till by
assiduity I worked my way into the patching department of a
West-End tailor's. Then more strenuous efforts, self-education
before breakfast, a scholarship at the Bermondsey Industrial
University, and then the first marmalade factory. Now they
spread far and wide, and 1 manufacture sufficient marmalade
each year to spread over Wales.
j LCut. And all this triumph you may retain by marrying me.
You hear?
Thorn. Yes, I know.
Cut. Think it well over. Your place in society! What man
is worth giving up for that?
[The curtain is lotvered for a few minutes. When it rises
Gerald, an employe of Cutprise, is discovered gazing
affectionately into the wan face of THOMASINK.
Gerald. You were to give me your answer to-day!

(Toast for the Vaccinated.)
Ger. Be brave
Thorn. If I could get rid of the awful suspicions.
Ger. (starting). Suspicions?
Thorn. Yes. You are different from most men. Frosh-coni-
plexioned, white-handed, gentle-mannered, and free from the
efficient strenuity that characterises the potent forces of our
modern civilisation. I sometimes think, forgiveme, that although
an employe here you are not a member of tho middle class.
Think what it means! (Gerald starts.) I can only live in
society. Assure me you are middle-class and I will say Yes.
Ger. {trembling). Thomasine
Thorn. You hesitate. I am right, you are an aristocrat? Tell
me, tell me
Ger. Ah ! I have renounced all that
Thorn. Impossible. There are too many vigilant eyes ready
to detect aristocratic interlopers. Tell me you have no blue
blood, that you sprung from nothing.
[GERALD waves his hands despondently. He struggles with
his feelings, gasps, and then nerves himself to speak
out.
Ger. (with calm despair). I cannot deceive you. I am a
duke!
Thorn, (with erg of horror). A duke! Ah! My worst fears.
The very word is enough. A duke! Oh, it's too awful! We
must never see one another again. It's impossible. Me—a
duchess! Oh, it's too horrible! I can't think of it!
[The curtain is lowered for a few minutes. When it is raised
another employi is sitting facing THOMASINE, again
tranquil.
Second Em. You were to give me your answer to-day!
Thorn, (rising and walking up stage rapidly). What you have
told me makes it impossible that anything but the most distant
nodding acquaintance can subsist between us.
Second Em. Ah! you have no pity.
Thorn. Do not let us prolong tho interview which must be so
distasteful to both of us
Second Em. (in anguish). Was it any fault of mine that my
father died a millionaire? I was reared in luxury; before I was
of an age to realise the awful fortune to which I was born the
insidious habit of comfort had got too firm a hold on my system.
The loathed name of plutocrat (Thomasine shivers) became early
attached to me, and with the awful curse of a hundred thousand
a year I have dragged my dreadful and luxurious way through
life, scorned, slighted and tabooed by the cream of successful
society.
Thorn. And you ask me to link my name with one who is tho
constant theme of social condemnation and the subject of
democratic meetings!
Second Em. I have tried to work, but having been educated
at a University, I find I know nothing. But I am already very
strenuous. I am now a supernumerary tomato-tin-opener. Give
me a chance and I will work my way up. With my money
Thorn. Your money! your money!
Second Em. (grimly). You are right. I must be content to
remain a mere decoration on the fringe of so—so—society, to be
for over a submerged plutocrat. You are right.
[Head sinks on his breast. The curtain is again lowered.
When it is raised Cutprise is being'formally accepted
by Thomasine. The folding doors are open and the two
employes are seen breaking up the office furniture in the
twentieth century dramatic style. The curtain then falls,
marking the end of the play. W. H. M.

IN IMAGINATION.
r"MisB Marie CoBBLLI read an interesting address to the Edinburgh
Philosophical Society last evening on what she called 'The Vanishing
Gift.' The vanishing gift meant imagination."—Daily Telegraph.}
(An Imaginary Address to M&cenas.)
All writers have this fault—that when a score
Of novels they have written, to the'forc
They needs must press in other walks of life.
Perchance attempt on streams of party strife
To pour their midnight oil, perchance to lend
A helping hand to some politic friend.
Empyreal fire disdaining, glad they light
To bo espied in an Imperial light.
And while much thought they give to other woes,
Their crippled grammar unattended goes.
In short, each writer strives to attain the end
Of national guide, philosopher and friend.
Maecenas, wouldst thou know the writer's art
By which ho plays so various a part,
By which he feels himself innately fit
To be at once Scott, Shakspeare, Eliot, Pit?
Know that this gift, this spirit of self-elation
Springs from a rich and strong imagination!
Imagination! lovely, laughing fay!
How wonderful the tricks thou lov'st to play!
The nodding clerk sinks back in soft repose
Before his figures long unadded rows,
By thee persuaded ho has earned his wage
In languor lolls upon the ledger's page.
By thee the hungry, when he shall partake
Of—what is not too rare—a toughish steak,
Beguiled, shall swear 'tis tender as can be,
And prove a martyr to the steak—and thee!
The densest fog that veils the winter's skies
Before a strong imagination flies,
Unless it happen ere the charm be tried
One doth with some belated friend collide,
When each shall greet the other with an oath,
To dwell on which imagination's loath.
And on me it has ever been my way
To let imagination have full play.
What am I? Be my talents great or small,
With imagery I can colour all
Till I shall seem, by virtue of my stories,
The height of England's literary glories,
The pride, the honour of the British nation,
All this, MAECENAS—in imagination!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Dealing with The Life of Lord Russell of
KiUowen (Smith, Elder), Mr. Barry O'Brien has
the advantage of personal intimacy with the sub-
ject of his essay. In the case of the late Lord
Chief Justice, that is a condition more than
customarily essential to success. To the outside
5/ world, not excepting the Bar, Russell's leading
characteristics (apart from his genius) were his
short temper and his sharp speech. He was truly, as the
cabman said of John Foster "a harbitrary gent." But be-
hind a frowning countenance he, not always successfully,
concealed the kindest of hearts. There were two Charles
Russei.ls, one in wig and gown, facing meanness and un-
truthfulness in the witness box, or confronted by stupidity
on the part of whatsoever hapless person; the other beaming
in a circle of intimate friends, or the centre of the happy
family circle. My Baronite was privileged to know him at
Tadworth Court, where the real man was disclosed. Mr.
O'Brien touches a chord in the home life when he quotes the
letter written to Lord Russell's daughter, May, when she
finally resolved to take the veil. Perhaps never has so beauti-
ful and tender an epistle been written under the formidable
headline, "Royal Courts of Justice." Russell was entirely a
self-made man, shouldering his way to the front, and holding
his place there by sheer capacity. His crowning triumph came
at tho end, when he stepped from the Bar to the Bench.
Everyone admitted his supremacy as an advocate. Many,
including faithful friends, feared that what should bo the
judicial serenity of tho Bench would, when he sat upon it, be
disturbed by occasional outbursts of angry impatience. Before
Russell had worn the ermine six months, the point of con-
troversy was whether he was not greater as a Judge than he
had been supreme as an advocate. Ho leaves behind him tho
memory of a strenuous life, a brilliant career. Tho value of
Mr. O'Brien's admirable record is enhanced by a photogravure
of Mr. Sargent's painting of the Lord Chief Justice—a master-
piece of portraiture.
Up-to-date boys, on seeing the representation, on the cover,
of a proud but wily "Heathen Chinee" with a drawn sword,
may be sure that The Dragon of Pekin, by Captain F. S. Beres-
ford, R.A.M.C. (Blackie and Son, Ltd.), is an exciting story
of the late Boxer Rebellion. Two English boys, with the
daring only to bo found in the youthful heroes in Christmas
books, after varied hairbreadth escapes, manage not only to
get into the Legations, but out again, and finally reach Tient-
sin! Their enemy, the villain Sung, dies tragically at the
hands of his own Boxers.
Samuel Merwin is a name unfamiliar to the Baron, who, in
making this candid admission, lays himself open to the obvious
retort that not to know Merwin argues himself unknown. But
"that's as may be," and the Baron is glad to have this oppor-
tunity of making Mr. MeRWIN'S literary acquaintance through
the medium of his most excellent romance, entitled The Road to
Frontenue, which is not a guide book, although the publisher is
Murray. As the romances writ in Indian ink by Fenimore
COOPER were to an earlier generation, so ought the stories by
Samuel Merwin to bo to the present, that is, should he con-
tinue in the line of romance business whereof the Road to
Frontenac is a first-rate specimen. The descriptions are
vividly picturesque, the actors stirringly dramatic, and the
reader's interest in the adventures is never allowed to flag for
one single second.
In writing his autobiography Before I Forget (FISHER CNWIN),
Mr. CHEVALIER discloses Hie secret of his brilliant success. He
just thinks and works—thinks incessantly, works patiently.
He is, in a literal sense, what some years ago Mr. Punch
dubbe.l him, a Chevalier il'Industrie. When it is done, it seems
easy to don "t'.ic pearlies," and sing "My Old Dutch" so
as to bring both tears and laughter to the countenance of
the audience. The spell is wrought by Chevalier only
after profound study of the original and the exercise of
that intuition of human nature which is recognised as
genius. The popular singer-in-character is the product of
the penny reading craze of thirty years ago. His first en-
gagement on tho stage was as one of the boys in TOM
Taylor's comedy To Parents and Guardians. Ten shillings a
week was his salary, an assured fortune upon which he must
have looked back with regret when, some years later, on tour
with John Beauchamp, their total receipt at Northampton on
Bank Holiday night was one shilling. Amongst the charges
brought against members of the theatrical profession is that
of inordinate personal vanity. There may be some modern
memoirs—wild horses would not drag from my Baronite identifica-
tion—wherein the charge is sustained. A charm about Mr.
Chevalier's tale is the unaffected modesty of the narrator.
The only people he extols are those with whom he has worked,
and the one or two who helped him when he could not help
himself, an epoch, not too thickly peopled, to which all success-
ful men look back with gratitude. Shrewd observation, a keen
sense of humour, wide experience, enable him to write a book
at once entertaining and instructive. Its pages arc illuminated
with many photographs of the songster 'in his most popular
characters on the music-hall stage.
"It is to be hoped," says my Right Reverend Bishop-
Baronite, "that the Aldine House publishers of the pocket-
able Temple Bible, whereof the first two books, eruditely
edited by Drs. Sayce and Kennedy, have already appeared,
will include The Apocrypha in their excellently got-up
re-issue, as being of considerable interest to the biblical
student."
In The Temple Classics series (Dent & Co.) the Baron has
just been reading that most delightful of all books of Eastern
travel, Charles Kinglake's Eothen. Written light-heartedly
in the early forties of last century, its matter and style are as
fresh as on the first day of its publication; more so, indeed, if
that were possible, seeing that the interest having been allowed
to increase (as in the mysterious East it ever will) at compound
rate, tho record of his tour is more valuable than ever; while
the buoyant spirit of this keen observer and most candid
raconteur having lost none of its "go," the book will always
bo an admirable model for literary tourists.
"I'inbound to say," quoth the Baron—"aye, and as hand-
somely bound as are the two volumes of Lamb's Tales from
Shakspeare (Raphael Tuck and Sons, Ltd.), with introductions
and additions (but no 'subtractions' thank goodness !) by
F. J. FURNIVALL, M.A. Camb., charmingly illus-
trated by Harold Copping,—that no more perfect
present as a Christmas book for all, whether
young, middle-aged, or old, can be found} than
these dear old familiar talcs (with new heads and
bodies supplied by artist) by sweet Mary La MB
and her delightful brother Charles."

JACOB AND HIS MASTER.
Part II.
The beautiful Miss DlNCOMBE was eighteen years of age when
sho dawned rcsplendently upon the highest society in her
native land, and if she did not at once become engaged to a
peer of the realm or a South African millionaire, the fault lay
neither with her parents nor with eager postulants for her
hand. It was disappointing for the postulants, but scarcely
disquieting to Mr. and Mrs. BUNCOMBE, that she saw fit to
decline all offers during her first London season; for indeed she
was pretty enough and charming enough to claim the right of
taking her time. Phyllis was wayward and fastidious; but
that really did not matter, since several years of ample
opportunity lay evidently before her. Now it came to pass,
one evening in the course of her second season, that she was
taken in to dinner by Mr. Theodore Cracroft, a comparatively
young politician who had already made his murk in the House,
and who was destined—so well-informed persons predicted—to
go far in public life. She did not pay her neighbour's pre-
liminary remarks the compliment of listening to them, but as
soon as sho had finished her soup she turned her lovely face
towards him and said:
"This is a stroke of good fortune for me, Mr. Cracroft; you
are the one person whom I have been wanting to meet for ever
so long, and I was beginning to be afraid that our paths would
never cross."
"I am more than flattered," smilingly returned the well-pre-
served gentleman with the short brown beard who sat on her
left. "May I venture to hope that my little volume of verse
has found favour in your eyes, then?"
"I won't deceive you," answered the young lady composedly;
"I will confess, to my shame, that I didn't even know you had
composed a little volume of verse."
"Poor, unappreciated me! So you take an intelligent interest
in contemporary politics, I suppose?"
"Not more than is unavoidable from the fact that my father
is a Member of Parliament. You belong to his party, I believe,
and my sympathies are with you both, little as I understand
what all the fuss is about. But I do take an immense interest
in your nephew Bob. How is Bob ?—and where is he ?—and
why does ho never so much as send a message to his old
friends?"
Mr. Craorokt laughed. "Oh, BOB is all right; he has been
in the Mediterranean for some time past; but he is on his way
home now, and I expect him to turn up in London any day. I
am sure he will be proud to hear that you remember his
existence."
"He ought to be ashamed of himself if he has ever doubted
that, and still moro ashamed if he has forgotten mine and
Jacob's."
"Jacob's?" repeated Mr. Cracroft interrogatively. Then,
with a sudden flash of memory, "Oh, the <log, to bo sure!
Jacob Faithful, yes! Dear me! What a long time it seems
since that bitter March afternoon of my poor brother's funeral
when the boy tramped over to your place, taking tho four-
footed friend whom I really couldn't olTer to adopt with him!
Jacob Faithful survives, does he?"
"Of course he does; he is in the prime of life. Now tell me
all about Bob, please."
There was not a great deal to be told; but what there was
redounded entirely to Bob's credit. He had given his uncle
and guardian no sort of trouble; he was getting on capitally
in his profession; he was quite as likely as not to die in tho
uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet. He had never, Mr.
Cracroft generously admitted, been in any sort of way a bore.
That he ended, on this particular evening, by becoming some-
what of a bore was due only to Miss Buncombe's persistency in
talking about him—for which he could not fairly be blamed.
But in truth it was very pleasant to be honoured with Miss
Dcncombe's undivided attention, upon no matter what pretext;
so the self-complacent Theodore (many great ladies, and some
great men, had given this budding statesman excuse for self-
complacency) harboured no ill-will against his nephew. To be
jealous of a mere boy like Bob would be too absurd; yet it did
occur to Theodore Cracroft, when he returned to his luxurious
chambers at a late hour, that he could quite easily learn to feel
jealous of anybody whom Phyllis Dcncombe might be pleased
to favour. He was ambitious, sybaritic, by no means as well
off as he would have liked to be: it obviously behoved him to
espouse some heiress or wealthy widow. But, unluckily for
him, he had refined, fastidious tastes, while his heart was a
somewhat susceptible one. Therefore the thought of Miss
Phyllis—so pretty, so fascinating, so well-connected, so ad-
mirably qualified to secure and retain social recognition for her
future husband !—drew several profound sighs from him. For
although Mr. Duncombk was a rich man, he had a large family
and could scarcely be expected to bestow more than a modest
marriage-portion upon his daughter.
Theodore unlocked one of tho drawers of the writing-table
and took therefrom certain letters which he had already perused
more than once. They related to the recent discovery that
coal lay beneath the surface of the hitherto barely remunerative
Eirkhall estate, and they contained offers which looked highly
advantageous to the proprietor of that estate. The proprietor
had not as yet been made acquainted with them, inasmuch as
he had only within tho last few days come of age, and his
guardian had very properly hesitated to make arrangements on
his behalf. But ho would soon be in London now, and his
guardian had already ceased to possess legal control over him.
Fortunate young beggar ! — more fortunate than grateful, no
doubt. His property had been well and carefully administered
for him during his minority; but that he would see in that
circumstance any reason for allowing the administrator a share
in his luck was, of course, most improbable. One cannot be a
barrister, much less a politician, for a considerable number of
years, without recognising the melancholy truth that ours is
an inherently selfish race. So Mr. Theodore Cracroft, M.P.,
sighod once more, put away his papers and went to bed. The
drawer contained other documents—offensive documents, set-
ting forth, most of them, the curt statement of "account ren-
dered "—which he wisely refrained from examining. He was
desirous of forgetting them, and fairly successful, as a rule,
in so doing.
A day or two later his nephew, just arrived from Portsmouth,
strode in upon him—a brown-faced, well-knit young yellow,
with white teeth, clear eyes, and a breezy manner.
"Well," Uncle Theodore," said he, "here I am, you see!
Off your hands at last, and ready to take over my title-deeds,
which are worth about twopence half-penny a year, I suppose,
eh?"
"Oh, you will find them worth rather more than that, 1
hope," answered the older man, smiling; "but we won't
discuss business matters until after dinner."
His ward and he had seldom met since the former had first
gone to sea, and had corresponded only at rare intervals. They
had not much in common; still, their relations had always been
amicable, and they had a species of distant mutual regard.
This, naturally, grew somewhat warmer after an excellent
dinner, acoompanied by a sufficiency of champagne; so that
when the time came for Mr. Cracroft to render an account of
his stewardship, he was in the presence of an indulgent and
amenable auditor.
"Well, you see how it is," he wound up a full and lucid
narrative by saying: "there is the chance, which we must
not venture to call more than a chance, that this coal mine
may prove highly remunerative; but then again, there is the
contrary possibility to be considered. I need scarcely point
out to you how important it is, in such cases, that the owner
should be upon the spot to look after his interests, and"

"Oh, I can't be
upon the spot,"
interrupted Bob;
11'm as good as
booked for West
Africa now, I be-
lieve."
"That a man
should be sen-
tenced to the West
African station,
and look as if he
liked it! Well!
well! tastes
differ."
"It's a beastly
climate of course;
but there's every
prospect of fight-
ing in those parts
just now," BOB
explained. "At
least, so they
say."
"H'm! I can
only repeat that
tastes differ. But
to return to what
we were talking
about. Quite the
best thing you
could do, I should
say, would be to
sell Eirkhall, if a
purchaser were
discoverable. The
place, now that the
existence of coal
is an ascertained
fact, should be
worth something
substantial — five
or six thousand
pounds, perhaps."
Bob opened his
eyes and his
mouth; the sum
named sounded to
him a very sub-
stantial one in-
deed; though, if he had been better informed, he would have
known that his patrimony must either be worth considerably
less or a great deal more. "Do you suppose I could get hold of
a purchaser at that figure? " he asked.
A would-be purchaser was not far to seek. Bob's uncle was
quite open and straightforward about it; he pointed out that
his position as an ex-trustee might lay him open to subsequent
criticism of an unfavourable character, that he might make an
uncommonly good bargain by paying £5,000—which was the
highest price he felt justified in offering—for the Kirkhall
estate, and that the owner, before deciding to sell, ought
certainly to see all the correspondence which had passed upon
the subject of the proposed mining operations. But Bob
declared that five thousand down was good enough for him.
"If you think it worth your while to take the place off my
hands on spec, Dncle Theodore, it's yours; and the more you
profit by the transaction, the better I shall be pleased. I used
to think, when I was a youngster"
"Good heavens! what are you now?"
"I shall be a flag-lieutenant before you know where you are,"

He. "My people ahe bothering me to marry' Miss Mayford."
She. 'You'd be very lucky if you niD. She is very' clever and very reaitiful
He. 'Oh! / don't want to marry brains and beauty. I want to marry vou.'
answered Bob,
with a grin. "I
was 'going to say
that I used to
think I should
rather like to end
my days at Kirk-
hall; but I expect
that's past pray-
ing for now. Most
of the things that
one used to dream
about in one's
puppyhood are
past praying for."
He added, after a
moment of silence,
"I suppose you
never hear or see
anything of the
Duncombes, do
you?"
"I had the plea-
sure of meeting
them at dinner not
long ago," Mr.
Cracroft made
honest reply.
"Miss Dunoombe
inquired about
you; she has de-
veloped into a
smart young lady
and a famous
beauty."
"The deuce she
has! I wonder
whether she would
condescend to re-
ceive me if I looked
her up."
"I daresay she
and her mother
would be happy to
receive you, if
they happened to
be at home; but I
am not sure that
I should advise
'you to call.
People of the class to which they belong are apt to be dis-
concertingly patronising to the likes of us, and what is the use
of inviting a snub?"
Notwithstanding this discouragement, which he recognised
as being kindly meant, Bob betook himself on the following
afternoon to Mr. Duncombe's town residence in Eaton Square.
He said to himself that, after all, his old playmate was not
likely to insult him; and that, even if she should, his shoulders
were broad enough to bear any burden that might be laid
upon them. He met with the good fortune which proverbially
faVours the audacious. Mrs. Dcncombe, he was informed, was
not at home; but Miss Duncombe, for whom he promptly asked,
was, and no sooner had she received his card than she sum-
moned him by a most cordial message to her presence.
He found her in the great, cool, flower-scented drawing-room
all alone, save for the shaggy companion who was ever at her
side—found her and fell, so to speak, prostrate before her then
and there. Literally, he stood bolt upright and shook hands in
an awkward manner (being more than a little shy); but if he had
flattered himself that his boyish passion for Phyllis Dunoombh

was a thing of the past, he was at once undeceived. For
the pirl who smiled so brightly upon him was the old Phyllis,
idealised ; the same (only more so) in face, in voice, nay, even
—so she gave him to understand—in constancy to the absent.
To be upbraided with his own lack of constancy, reproached
for having never once written during all those long years, and
accused of having no heart at all was infinitely more delightful
than the kindliest welcome would have been to him. And then
Jacob Faithful, who scrutinised him doubtfully, with ears
cocked and head on one side, until he spoke, leapt on a sudden
on to his knees and overwhelmed him with rapturous caresses.
Well, that sort of
thing was enough to
turn any young man's
head, and if, in the agi-
tation of the moment,
Bob gave utterance to
some extravagant asser-
tions, no doubt Miss
BUNCOMBE pardoned
them. She was also
pleased to pardon his
past offences of omission
when it had been made
clear to her that these
had been duo to an ex-
cess ivo and misplaced
humility ; only she could
not allow him to say
that it was impossible
for the dog to know him
again after such a lapse
of time, because nothing
was more evident than
that the dog did know
him again.
"I have never known
Jacob make advances to
a stranger," she de-
clared. "Ho is always
polite, both to human
beings and to other dogs,
and ho only fights when
he is attacked; but he
doesn't encourage fami-
liarity, much less ob-
trude it."
"Good old Jake! He
sounds rather as if he
took after his former
master."
"His former master
might do worse than
take after him—has done worse, indeed, in some respects.

a master and a mistress. But canine intelligence is more
direct than human in its conclusions, and, despite this clear
encouragement, Lieutenant Cracroft, R.N., refrained from
putting forward preposterous suggestions. Ho only begged
Miss Duncombe to be so very kind as to keep his dog for him
a little longer, in consideration of the notorious insalubrity
of the West African climate.
This, naturally enough, led to a prolonged discussion of the
perils belonging to the young man's destined station and to
expressions of deep regret that he should have applied—as he
confessed he had done—for employment in so deadly a region.
No wonder that young
man left Eaton Square
in an elated frame of
mind, with Jake trotting
at his heels. For Jake's
mistress insisted upon
resigning her charge
during the brief period
of Bob's stay in London,
and that remarkable dog
acquiesced in the pro-
posed arrangement as a
matter of course. The
ways of dogs are past
finding out; and so,
alas! are those of women.
Still, if Bob had had a
little more experience of
the latter, he would
doubtless have divined
that all this extreme
amiability on Miss
Phyxlis's part was any-
thing but a hopeful sign.

reproachfully asked.
"No; I don't mean to say that / should like it, but I am
almost afraid he would. Just look at him! Isn't he saying as
plainly as possiblo that no dog can sorve two masters?"
He really did seem to be saying something to that effect.
Ho was apologetic about it; ho went to PHYLLIS when she

him. His manner implied that n compromise might be arranged

III.—The Story of tub One-Eyed Duck.
(Continued from page 807.)
"Children would get on very well if there were no nurse-
maids," said the one-eyed duck grumpily.
"Nursemaids," chirped a perky-looking sparrow, "were
invented to provide conversation for the military."
The one-eyed duck looked with ruffled disgust at the inter-
rupter, but she only said, "Fly away, there's a good chap, I'm
telling my friend a story, though, if you like to hear it . . ."
"Can't stop !" cut in the sparrow. "A pal of mine has told
me of some splendid place where you can get one of the* best
crumb suppers in London. You lot me have a note of it later."
"Yes, yes," said the duck, then observed in a low tone to her
companion: "Have to keep on good terms with the little good-
for-nothing. He's undertaken to edit my reminiscences."
"Well," observed the friend rather impatiently, "let's have
the story. There's fog coming, and I shall go to sleep at sunset."
"I can't be flurried!" said the one-eyed duck. "But when
you 're sleepy we '11 adjourn. The other day when the pea-
hen was telling you about her love affair I noticed you were
asleep the whole time."
"If you'd been a confidante so often as I have, you'd do the
same," returned herfriend. "I'm rather anxious to learn how
you got that eye damaged."
"Because I saved a child's life." And she plumed her
feathers with an impressive air.
"Unnecessary! There are too many about as it is."
'' 'Twas quite accidental,'' explained the narrator. '' The fact
is, the silly little thing had dropped a doll in the water. I
swam up"
"You thought the doll was something tasty, I suppose?"
"Our best motives, our noblest impulses, are perhaps tainted
by a thought of self," said the one-eyed duck reflectively.
Her friend made no reply. Philosophy always bored her, and
she proceeded to conduct minute investigations somewhat on the
lines of Calverley's dog. The effort proved exhausting.
"You 're asleep," said the one-eyed duck. "To-morrow at
ten—by the fountains." (To be continued.)

A REAL USE FOR FOG.
Dear Mr. Punch,—I have invented an
ingenious machine for utilising London
fogs, and I should be glad if you would
bring it to the notice of the authorities,
as it is not only effective but economical.
By its use the fog is cut into slabs of
solid material, which can be employed
for paving or building purposes. My in-
vention should also commend itself to the
London County Council, the more so as
it can slice the solid atmosphere into
smaller blocks, which make most excel-
lent fuel. This Christmas 1 intend to
burn a Yule log fashioned from this
neglected material. All the nonsense
written about fans and steam-blasts docs
not commend itself to
Your obedient Servant,
Ferdinand Fogey
(Sole Patentee of the London
and Provincial Fogometer).
Tile Inventories, S.W.
P.S.—If you know of any enterprising
capitalists, I should be very willing to
let them find the money wherewith to
syndicate my invaluable invention.
LOVE'S SPELL.
In Celia's ear I breathed a tale
Of youth and rosy love,
But nothing did my sweets avail,
Her heart I could not move.
All unconcerned she heard me out,
Serene and self-possessed,
And in her two lips' budding pout
My failure stood confessed.
Love's magic spell in vain 1 wove,
The charmed circle drew,
With honey-dropping words I strove
Her colduess to subdue.
The letters four I bade her range —
L-O-V-E, to tell
The truth, I prayed her heart would
chango
Beneath the mystic spell.
With languid hand she idly traced,
A graceful L, and then
Across the letter's slender waist
She twice drew cruel pen.
I saw then why my tale of lovo
Void of enchantment fell.
For Celia, as her £ did prove,
Love had a different spell!
WALKER WELL IN THE RUNNING.
Since Mr. Punch no longer issues His
Own Private Poeket-Book, profusely illus-
trated, he is willing to admit that the
Pocket Books and Diaries of Walker &
Co. (Farringdon House) are among some
of the next best things to the above-
mentioned unique little volume. Those
for 1902 are no way inferior to those of
former years, and being more or less on
the old form, present no startling novelty,
except here and there in the catalogued
description, as, for example, a "Fast"
diary, which Mr. P. would be curious to
see when filled up (by any one "fast")
in the course of the next twelve months.
There is something in the names of
the varieties, as, for example, a "solid
Pigskin" diary is suggestive of the
record of a very obstinate person; an
"Orient Limp" might bo suitable to
a Pasha quite overcome by tho heat;
a "Medium Octavo" would suit a pro-
fessional Spiritualist for jotting down
engagements; while "A Quarterly Pocket
Diary" is evidently suitablo for those
fortunate annuitants who are sure of
making an entry every quarter.

THE IDEOCRAT AT THE DINNER-TABLE.
III.—With the W'orshipfix Company of Porkmongfrs.
How do you call the book? Our Uncrowned Kings f
'Tis new to me, who have but little time
Reserved from higher claims to keep abreast
With novel lines in literary goods.
A satire? Ah! I never greatly cared
For humour, notably such as leaves the mind
Vaguely aware of swift allusions lost,
Impalpable airy flights supposed of wit;
Clearly a state obnoxious to repose,
Being apt to cause diversion o' blood to brain,
Needed elsewhere to aid the liver's work
After your dinner, Nature's only hour
For reading. What? It's clever stuff, you say,
And levelled at the new plutocracy?
Well, 'tis the penalty we have to pay,
We of the wealth that tickles envy's ire,
Harmless, I hope, for whoso has his feet
So firmly planted he can well consent
To pay what silent pity greatness owes
To ignorant detraction found i' th' mouth
Of who, poor devils, after all must live.
Doubtless they have their figure, not too long,
If one but cared enough to buy them out.
Young D'Arcy wrote it? Why, I know the man;
Dined with us in the Lane—Lord only knows
Just where the women pick these scribblers up!
Came in and out, a tolerated guest,
Till he forgot his manners, had the face
To please my daughter, and was shown the door.
That's how, being entertained on sufferance,
They glean what little lore they boast to have
Of good society, and go their ways
And shamelessly profane its mysteries
In books like this! I say, you're never safe
If once your footmen let them pass the hall.
Mind, I distinguish. I refer to men
Professed of letters, not the other sort,
Mere social mercenaries I employ
(Paid by the Press in cash, by me in kind—
A dance, a dinner, even a simple crush)
To make a paragraph's advertisement,
Telling an eager public how I dine,
Who—and their jewels' value—graced my board,
Or under what unequalled wealth of flowers
The staircase laboured when my wife received.
With such I make no war; they earn their feed;
And, though they use what tact the case demands,
Impose on none that moves within the pale.
But when I see an open welcome given
To struggling men of literary tricks
In houses commonly assumed select,
Why, there's a snobbery finds mo justly wroth,
Who recognise that subtlest form of pride
Which bids remark its status how secure,
How unassailably proof against assault,
Since it allows itself to ope its doors
(No man's opinion asked) to whom it will,
Highway or hedge, made worthy for the nonco
By that approving seal the house confers.
Rank snobbery, so say 1!
Yet here again
I make a nice distinction, please to note;
Holding that even writers may be classed
In different ranks according to deserts.
How judge this difference, otherwise obscure,
Savo as we millionaires apprize success
By tangible results that take the eye?
Thus there are authors, as I understand,
So skilled to gauge the reading public's views,
And what new turn the market's like to take,
Making supply anticipate demand
Upon a scale so noble, that their art
Assumes proportions almost fit to wear
The higher style and dignity attached
To Commerce proper. Such a type as this,
Since prejudice is impotent to floor
The unanswerable logic of results,
I'd not refuse to meet, no matter where;
Nor would our Chairman, having thrice my wealth,
Yet strangely free from pride for one so great.
Rumour indeed alleges he was born
With literary tastes he might have turned
To lucrative employ, yet chose to be
The amateur and gentleman he is.
You 11 see him soon with what fine modesty,
As though oblivious how the nations gape
For awe of private monarchs like himself,
He bids you charge your glass to drink the King! O. 8.
APOSTROPHES!
TO A BLACK CAT.
"Wisdom embodied sits upon thy brow,
And long-drawn music lingers in thy 'meaow.'"
Pauim't Toemt.
Hah ! cat of ebon hue, and golden orbs
That gaze serenely on this nether world.
What thoughts are thine, the while with dext'rous paw
Thou add'st a lustre to thy furry face?
Dost thou hark back to Ancient Egypt's clime,
Where cats were sacred, and the mummied frame
Of many a mouser slept the dreamless sleep?
Doth thy mind loiter on that later age
When witch and wizard wrought unholy spells
With such as thee to aid? I may not know.
Perchance thy fancies do not range beyond
Careering mice and luscious bowls of milk;
But this 1 see, and marvel more and more,
Thou art a miracle of grace and power.
How lithe thy limbs, how beautiful thy paws,
How like an ebon angel is thy form!
To watch thy sweet contentment is a joy,
And doubtless thou art crammed with mystic lore.
If only I could read thy restless brain.
The World would be rewarded. Wondrous cat,
Thy lives are nine, thy tail is only one.
Thou art not of the cat-o'-nine-tails breed,
And yet, uiethinks, thou couldst a tale unfold
Would . . . hullo! what's that you say, Matilda?
Killed my canary'! Mangled its remains?
Confound the horrid, vicious, ugly beast!
Let ine get at it with a poker . . . gone!
And I am left to "dree my weird" and mourn.
Mr. Punch's Museum.—"Suburban Water-Cart." This playful
toy, which dates from the mismanagement period of London streets
(first decade of twentieth century) was remarkable for its capri-
cious and unexpected habits. Its chief accomplishment was to
irrigate the gutters and kerbstones in a leisurely way, and now
and then display a freakish humour by suddenly spraying over
foot-passengers' boots. It was a sworn foe to cyclists and posi-
tively revelled in causing side-slips. On a rainy day, however,
the perambulating whimsicality was at its best, when it de-
lighted to show off in the middle of the road and add its quota
to the seas of mud. Much of the dislocation of London traffic was
caused by these wayward, if well-meaning, obstructions.

By borrowing for the young Hellene John Bull's especial pas-

the power to appreciate the value of intellectual recreation,

spect this odd congeries will be astonished at tho marvel-

[" According to a German scientist, the moral qualities hare serums with

FAITH, hope and charity, love, hate,
Ambition, envy, gall—
Whatever moralists may state—
Are microbes one and all.
Each has its serum -which yon can
Inoculate: e.g.,
To make a perfect public man
Be this your recipe:
Take a man in the street, the first one that you meet—it really
don't matter much ■who,
For the truth to confess, he can hardly know less than our

To All him with nerve, espieglerie, verve, dose him 'well with a
serum of S-l-sb-RY;
If he wants situations for all his relations, correct with a
virus of H-lsb-RY.
If modesty, tact and good breeding are lacked, if his language
is vulgar and low,
These faults, I am sure, you will easily cure with a serum of
Gentleman Joe.
If he's limp in the back and inclined to be slack, of a dry
academic complexion,
And inclining to shirk Parliamentary work, dose him well with
a B-lf-r injection.
If his somnolent mind is to slumber inclined, if he yawns when
his speech is begun,
A D-v-nsh-re serum will certainly clear him from dozing until
it is done;
While if he is found to be feeble all round, and on nothing
especially strong,
These faults to correct you need only inject a double strong
serum of L-ng.
TO ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
Beloved Shade,—I like to think of you, now that you have
put away the stress and fret of life, and have been rapt from
us to the society of the mighty dead, your meet companions
who went before you and hailed you as your ghostly feet
touched the borders of their glorious country. I like to
imagine you, I say, stretched at ease in the meadow of aspho-
del, with Fielding and Scott and Dickens and Thackeray,
and the great Dumas, the beneficent thunder-shaking giant,
to bear you company. There is no envy, nor hatred, nor
malice, nor any uncharitableness, but a deep glow of happy
contentment is over all. You are warriors who have fought
your fight amongst us and havo gone to your rest, leaving to
us not only your pleasant voices, the nightingales that are
still awake with us, but high and noble lessons of courage
and endurance and kindness and humanity, to sustain our
faltering efforts. Sometimes you speak and again you listen,
now compelling silence, now compelled to it, emulous only in
great and kindly thoughts, and the high peaks echo and
re-echo with your laughter. It is a heathen fancy, but let it
pass. Be sure of this, at any rate: we, who still live out our
little lives in the busy haunts of men, and whose tired minds
turn for refreshment to romance and poetry, and the eternal
records of heroism and faith and gallant deeds, we love
you as of old and reverence your name. Of all the gay and
splendid souls that have flashed across our sky with a trail of
glory, none was more vivid than yours, none has left a more
enduring memory. Your company of brave men and noble
women are still our friends. We leave with them the beaten
round of our daily lives, and plunge into magic regions,
watching with a still breathless interest their efforts, hear-
ing them strike their blows and speak their sounding
phrases, and following them, foiled or triumphant, to the end.
Man may be a vain thing, a purposeless shadow flitting across
his little tract of earth, but the creatures of man's imagination,
the shapes he calls into being, breathing the breath of life into
their lungs, these remain with us and fill our minds. So Hector
and Achilles, Ajax and Ulysses live, while HOMER is no more
than a name to be quarrelled over by pedants and archaeologists.
In one sense you are more, in another, perhaps, less, fortunate
than Homer. Your life has been written, and all men can learn
what manner of man you were. Those who were your friends
and loved you may renew their memories of your presence,
your cheerful talk, and your astounding achievements with that
magician's wand, your pen. They, and those who knew only
your fame and had not clasped your hand, can follow you in
your cousin's authentic pages from infancy to middle age
through all the varying scenes of your high-spirited and
adventurous life. It is a pious book, compiled and written with
zeal and discretion, and the picture it gives is that of a real
man, not a mere image made up of proof sheets and printer's
ink. The tone is kindly and generous, as the tone of such a
book ought to be. That you were a man and that, being a man,
you had your moments of weakness, of uncompleted effort, nay,
of entire failure and warping error, who shall deny? But what
of that? We are such as God made us, who made it our lot to
rise, our own strenuous vigour helping, through misery and
despair to success and triumph and the praise of men. So you,
it seems, rose, a bright and soaring spirit, cleaving your way to
the stars, disdaining to be drawn down by the weakness of the
flesh and its sufferings. That is enough, and for the rest I say—
No farther seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose),
The bosom of hia Father and his God.
And now let me end with a story for your private ear. There
was once a man—let us say he was moulded after your fashion,
and lived and died much as you did. After his death the world
went on reading his books, and his friends talked of him and
wrote of him, holding that it was good for the world to know
what a noble and delightful fellow he had been and how cheer-
fully he had looked out upon mankind, even through the mists
of approaching death. But one fine day there came along a
rough and blustering sort of companion, and, "By heaven,"
says he, "what a pother they are all making about one who
was after all a very poor and ordinary creature! Why, I was
the man who helped hiiu along; but for me he had never done
a hand's turn to deserve fame, and, if you '11 believe me, he
requited me, as he did all others, most scurvily. He outsoared
us, actually outsoared us all, won his way to glory while we,
his betters, were left flapping ineffectual wings. As for writing
books, have not others written much better books and earned a
smaller reward? And as for. the man himself as he lived among
his friends, all I can say is, he was often petty and dismal and
conceited and pragmatical—so much so, that some who knew
him would describe him by a word of three letters (oaf, fop,
cad, ass, don—the field is open for pleasant conjecture, and
you may make your own choice) that would make him turn in
his grave could he hear it. Pooh! I call him an Anxious
Egotist, a Shorter Catechist, an unfriendly and forgetting
friend, a being deteriorating from fault to fault — until
I ceased to care for the man, so little was there in him
to care for or reverence or praise. Not if I can help it
shall his frailties be hidden, so here you have them." And,
having finished, away he goes in a fine frenzy of self-righteous
indignation. But the widest part of the tale is yet to come.
This indignant follower of the veracities was one whom the
dead man held to be his friend, of whom he never spoke, so far
as public records may guide us, without kindness and affection.
What think you of this? For myself, I think it was not
Stevenson's way, nor ought it to be the way of any man who,
having loved a friend, has lost him.
Farewell, and own me YOUR Admirer.

(A Hutjtjeslion for a Yule-tide Story.)
"I DON'T think you will like it," said
the good manager seated behind the desk
in the bureau.
"That is all you know about it," re-
plied the husband. "House-keeping has
become intolerable."
"Yes, intolerable," echoed the wife.
"But there are so many drawbacks,"
urged the good manager. "For instance,
I am going to put you into a room with

"Well, I rather like dead walls," ob-
served the husband, "there]is a novelty
about] them. Besides, they shut out an
ugly prospect."
"Yes," chimed in the wife, "such as

quisitive neighbours seated for ever at
the windows."
"Then I don't think you will care
about the food," went on the good
manager, "it's very rich, and after three

"Well, that is better
returned the husband.
"Yes," added the wife, "a joint that
passes through the stages of hot, cold and
hashed."
"But we do something [in tho line of
comestible development ourselves. You
will find that the 'grand piece' of to-day is
the fricandeau of to-morrow. Besides, 1
am sure you won't care about the head-
waiter."
"On the contrary, they are always
exceedingly civil," put in the gentleman.
"Yes, very polite,'" added the lady.
"But ours is an exception to the rule,"
explained the good manager. "He will
give you a table that you won't like, and
not alter it for a fortnight."
"But even that will be better than our
own monotonous dining-room."
"As you will," said the good manager
with a sigh. "1 have warned you. Number
2,436."
So the husband and the wife entered
the lift, went up and up until they reached
the top floor.
Twenty-four hours later they were once
again in the bureau.
"You are quite right," said tho hus-
band, "I prefer our small and not too
comfortable home."
"They did not call us at the right hour,
and they put us at a table with four other
people."
"And tho soup was cold, and Wo had to
wait ten minutes between the courses."
"And I think the sheets were damp."
"And I couldn't find any daily papers
in the smoking-room."
"And so you are going home, sweet
home," cried the good manager, beaming.
"Yes," they answered together, "you
have reconciled us to the home that is
our very own."
So after they had spent a small fortune
in tips they entered the cab.
"Good bye, my dear friends," cried the

And the husband and tho wife blessed

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAJUVARI. [December 4, 1901.
OUR PUP.
When Gwendolen expressed a desire for
a little Aberdeen terrier with a kind face,
I knew in my heart of hearts that before
many weeks were past a pup would bo
amongst our Penates; but at the same
time I felt it my duty to point out the
difficulties of keeping such a pet in a
small flat, in order that, when the hour
came, I might have the smug satisfaction
of feeling—I should never venture to say
it—" I told you so."
"My dear," I objected, "you know
that our lease specially prohibits dogs."
"And I know that every tenant in the
mansions keeps one."
This was true. I had often watched the
guilty procession of men and maids that
at ton o'clock every evening stole down
the stairs like so many conspirators, each
leading his contraband property on a
leash. At such a time the. party-wall of
stiff reserve that prevented No. 28 speak-
ing to No. 29 was broken down, and the
owner of the yellow dachshund might be
seen exchanging amenities with the master
of the black poodle or listening to the
basement expounding the points of his
nondescript cur. Occasionally, too, the
dogs exchanged amenities as well as their
masters, and when the Irish terrier met
the bull on the first landing, only pepper
and lighted vestas could part their warm
embrace.
"You needn't be afraid of fights, Jack,"
broke in Owundolen, who had evidently
been following the train of my thoughts.
"Afraid, my dear?"
"Well, you know you went quite pale
when the porter asked you to catch hold
of Paddy's tail."
"It was a disgusting sight," I replied,
my heart palpitating at the recollection.
"So it was," agreed Gwen; "but, at
any rate, the pup won't fight."
"Not till he becomes a dog. Then
there's Augusta. Doesn't she object to
dogs?"
Gwendolen frowned. Time and again
had our general expressed in no measured
terms her hatred of all four-legged things.
"We must keep the pup out of her way,
Jack."
"In our flat?" I laughed.
"Of course. It will be perfectly
simple."
I whistled.
"Don't do that."
"I beg your pardon," said I.
A pause ensued; but apparently Gwen-
dolen found my silence as trying as my
whistling.
"What are you thinking of?" she
asked. ]
"I was wondering whether we should
give the pup our bedroom or the drawing-
room."
"Sarcasm "began Gwkn.
"It was anything but sarcasm,
darling."
"Then it was simply fatuity."
"On the contrary, my dear. If we
can't put the pup in AUGUSTA'S premises,
whore he would do little harm"
"We'll put him in the bath-room,
where he can do none."
This argument appeared to Gwendolen
conclusive, and as I dared not whistle
again, there was nothing for it but to
smile and say, " Very well."
No one treats a fallen foe more gener-
ously than Gwendolen. In a moment all
the fierce battle-lust was forgotten, and,
the pros having won the day, she was as
willing as I to admit the existence of
cons.
"But you know, Sear," she concluded,
"it will lie so good for you to take the
puppy for its walks. You sit in your
study all day long smok—working, and
you don't get half enough exercise. Your
figure is not quite so athletic as it was
when I saw you bump Brasenose, is it?
Then it will hardly cost us anything; it
will just live on the scraps that would
otherwise be wasted. We needn't even
get a licence for it till it is six months
old, and then you must just write a little
doggy poem for the Spectator. You '11 get
no end of copy out of the little fellow,
Jack!"
* * * *
"Oh, the darling 1" cried Gwendolen,
when I arrived home one evening with
the pup in my arms. "Look at his
'kind boot-buttons,' Jack! Isn't he a
dear little thing?"
"Rather !" I replied. He had already
cost me five guineas besides his railway
fare from Wick, not to mention a cab-
fare and compensation for a torn-up
cushion. But he looked very sweet and
innocent as he nestled in my overcoat,
and he put up his baby paw to Gwen-
dolen in- a way that won her heart at
once.
"There is a nice fire in the study. He
will be quite happy on the Persian mat."
"Will he?" I asked, vaguely thinking
of the bath-room.
"Oh, yes, I think so. See? How per-
fectly sweet he looks on the crimson
ground! But, Jack, they haven't sent
the biscuits."
"Haven't they? What a nuisance! 1
suppose we must just give him some
scraps to-night."
"Scraps! They would kill him! I've
been getting up Aberdeens, and they must
have nothing but puppy biscuits, with
some cod-liver oil cakes when they are
teething, and pepsinated puppy meal if
they are 'bad doers.' I've ordered all
these from the stores, with some dog soap
and towels, and the sweetest little basket
and mat that only cost thirty-live shillings.
But they haven't come, so you must go
and fetch the biscuits at any rate."
"But, my dear, it's just dinnertime."
"The stores will be shut if you don't
go at onoe. And Jack! it will save time
if you take a cab and bring all the things
together."
When I got back, I found the pup the
sole occupant of my study. He was very
busy on the rug and the floor was strewn
with paper. There was a loud yelp and
Gwendolen came rushing in.
"What are you doing, Jack?"
"My dear, he has eaten an Elzevir, and
was just starting on an Aldine."
Gwendolen screwed her courage to the
sticking place. "Bad puppy! Naughty!
Not to do that!" she reiterated, accom-
panying the reproaches with gentle
smacks.
The pup's ears fell, its tail went down
between its legs, and it looked such a
dejected little atom that I relented at
once. "Don't you think that will do,
Gwen? Poor little chap! I daresay he
was hungry, and if ho had had his biscuits
this wouldn't have happened."
After dinner, of which meal the pup was
a painfully interested spectator, I felt in
good fettle for work, and proposed that I
should go into the study, and write a
scene of my tragedy. Gwendolen usually
encourages me in any unwonted efforts of
this kind, but to-night she looked serious.
"Lydia tells me"—Lydia is a doggy
friend of Gwen's—" that a pup must be
taken out every two hours, so I think,
Jack, if you don't mind"
"In this fog?"
"Oh, that won't hurt the pup. LYDIA
says it must go out in all weathers—from
ten minutes to an hour, according to
circumstances.''
The • pup was as loth to go as I. It
planted its little broad feet firmly on the
floor and refused to budge. Persuasion had
no effect whatever except a deprecatory
wag of the tail, and I had to drag the strug-
gling mite down the stairs by sheer force.
By the time it reached the bottom it was
nearly strangled, and then it sat down on
the pavement and wagged its tail. I had
not the heart to^ drag it any further, so
we stood together shivering and inhaling
fog until we thought it time to venture
back again.
Very early next morning I was
awakened by the sound of energetic
scrubbing. GWENDOLEN is not inordi-
nately fond of scrubbing, while as for
AUGUSTA—I knew she had far too much
self-respect to be anywhere but in bed
at such an hour. I rose to see what it
was all about, and slipping on my
dressing-gown, opened the bath-room
door. Gwendolen was on her knees
scrubbing for dear life, while the pup
was dancing round her in high delight,
and making dabs at the flying brush.
"My darling !" 1 exclaimed.
Gwendolen looked up. "Oh! Jack,
I've got such megrims!"

"Whatever aro you doing, dear?"
"Why, you see, Jack, I came in to
have a look at the pup, and he must
have got his feet dirty last night, or
something, for the place was in an aw-
ful mess, and I knew that if AUGUSTA
saw it"
"I see, dear. But you really shouldn't
—and in that airy costume! 1 've, at
least, got on a dressing-gown."
"Very well," replied Gwen, relinquish-
ing the scrubbing-brush. "But do make
haste and get it done before Augusta
gets up."
I set to work and finished the job, but
not before I had felt the glance of amused
contempt which our mistress the servant
flung at me as she passed the bathroom on
her domestic rounds.
When I came to make tho puppy's bed,
I found he had not been idle even during
the night. My new guinea sponge was
torn into a thousand pieces, and my best
Turkish towel lay in shrods. I consulted
Gwendolen, and wo agreed that punish-
ment must be administered. I seized a
stick and raised a threatening arm. The
pup sat down, cocked his head on one
side, and cast kind but reproachful
glances at me.
"Hit him!" urged GWENDOLEN.
I tried. Thump, thump went the
puppy's tail on tho ground. I handed the
stick to Gwen.
"Well, you are a coward, Jack!"
"Perhaps if we asked Augusta," I
suggested.
"How can you be so cruel? Augusta
would hurt it."
So the puppy got off scot-free, and in
the course of the morning devoured my
favourite slippers. But, as Gwendolen
pointed out, this mattered the less be-
cause (as I soon found out) I was seldom
to take off my boots again, tho exigencies
of puppy nature requiring that I should
spend most of my life in the open air.
AUGUSTA regards the devotion of GWEN-
DOLEN and myself as mild lunacy—harm-
less, so long as tho pup does not trespass
in her kitchen, when she lots him "feel
the weight of her hand across his back."
She takes no pains to conceal her con-
tempt for my present occupation, though,
after all, it is not so very much lower
in her esteem than my late profession—
the writing of minor verse.

Here, where round circles cloak
With cloudlets ever vagrant

Mid tomes of vellum, yellow
With years and sweetly mellow,
Each dearer than its fellow,
We meditate and smoke.
While leave is ours to burrow
In books, we care no jot
Whether the lonely furrow
Is being ploughed or not;
Nor if Peer-ploughmen, weary
Of furrows lone and dreary,
Should seek a life more cheery
Beside the common pot.
No statesman's lucubrations
In this retreat read we,—
Not even the orations
Of him they call C.-B.;
But read with glowing wonder
The Demosthenic thunder
That PHILIP trembled under—
Our thoughts are all B.C.
Nor are we ever debtors
To fiction for our ease;
No Garden Books, Love-letters,
Nor Visits here one sees;
The music of Catullus,
We much prefer to lull us,
Or Flaccus, or Tibullus,
Or Aristophanes.
Thus, mid old comrades pleasant,
Whose souls so long have fled,
The past alone is present,
The present lies unread;
And in such tranquil setting,
Afar from care and fretting,
We live, the world forgetting,
Among the deathless dead.

A LETTER TO A
YOUNG PUB-
LISHER.
Nearly a year
must have passed,
my dear Jones,
since I last gave
you (through the
medium of Mr.
Punch's columns)
some modest hints
on the profession
—never, oh! never
let it be termed a
"trade" — upon
which you have
embarked. 1
pointed out, you
will remember,
how sweet are the
uses of advertise-
ment. I showed
you how, by the
magic of a few
hiatus marks, an
unfavourable ro-
view can be con-
verted into an en-
thusiastic eulogy;
so that, for exam-
ple, the opinion of
the Pirceus, which
ran: "This is a
thoroughly good
example of a rub-
bishy class of
book," etc., etc.,
will figure in your
advertisement
as, "This is a
thoroughly good
. . . book." But,
as you point out
to me, there are
limits to the use-
fulness of this
method. So grossly
prejudiced, it
seems, are many
of the critical journals, that, having ob-
served, it may be, your ingenious use of
their unfavourable reviews, they have
simply desisted from giving reviews' of
any kind to many of the works which
bear your imprint.
And so, I take it, the question you
now propound to me is this: "Sup-
posing that the verdicts of the" press
upon my publications are so worded
as to preclude the possibility of their
being twisted into laudatory sentences;
or, worse still, supposing that there
are no press verdicts at all — what
am I to do then? For instance, you tell
me that all 3*our efforts so far to boom
GREGSON'S Morbidities have proved
futile. Even the Lower i>loppina.ton Ad-
vertiser, whose critic you had como to

is not a dull page in this volume"—a
sentence employed by him four or five
times in every issue of the paper—even
the Lower Sloppington Advertiser, you re-
peat, has had the impudence to slate
Morbidities. Its sale hangs fire, you
have a thousand copies in hand, and
(beyond a paltry £40 or £50 you sur-
charged the author upon "the cost of
production ") you will make no profit out
of it. You suggest, as a last resource,
that you should boldly invent flaming
eulogies, and father them in your adver-
tisements upon the Times and the Athe-
nceum.
Candidly, I cannot recommend this
plan. For one thing, it is a trifle risky;
for another, it is quite unnecessary.
"No one," you complain, "will say a
good word for the wretched thing." That
is too hasty an
assertion. Pause
and consider for a
moment. Are there
no persons who arc
quite willing to
praise it as freely
as you could wish?
Why, obviously,
there are two —
QRHGBOH, its
author, and your-
self, its publisher.
"But," you may
object, "I can't
quote these
opinions as ad-
vert i sements."
My dear JONES,
that is precisely
what you can and
must do. Believe
me, you will not
bo the first to
adopt this simple
but excellent plan.
Take a column
of next week's
1'irrens, and fill it
with announce-
ments—in heavily-
leaded type — of
this kind:
"MORBIDITIES."
— Of this work
Mr. Gregson
writes: "I have
never done any-
thing so fine.
The book fairly
took away my
breath while I
was writing it.
Simple regard
for truth com-
pels me to pro-
nounce it a co-
lossal master-
piece. No one
i can k n o w s o
much about a book as its author, and
my dispassionate verdict pronounces
Morbidities a veritable triumph."
"MORBIDITIES."—As the publisher of
this remarkable novel, Mr. Jones ven-
tures cordially to endorse the author's
opinion of it. It is a superb piece of
work. So confident is he that it will
be a gigantic success, that he has given
instructions to the printers to prepare
fifteen more large editions with tho
utmost speed.

and the publisher's second-cousin. Tho
trick is quite simple, you see 1 A. C. D.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [Deckmbeb 4, 1901.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In the absence of Mr. SIDNEY Lee on a well-earned holiday,
the Assistant Editor of the National Dictionary of Biography
■writes:—
"In the ' Booking-Offlce' of your issue of November 13, in an appreciative
review of the Supplement to the Dictionary of National biography, I
notice that your Baronite states that he has searched Volume III. (How-
Woodwabd) in vain for a memoir of the proprietor of the Dictionary, the
late Mr. Gkobqe Smith. No memoir of Mr. Smith was introduced into the
alphabetical series for two reasons. First, because the work terminates with
the death of the late Queen Victoeia. Secondly, because it was thought
that the publio interest in Mr. Geoege Smith, as the founder of the
Dictionary, and as the publisher who had maintained close personal relations
with Thackeray and Leioh Hunt, Chaelotte Bbonte and Mrs. Gaskell,
was sufficient to warrant a somewhat more extended notice than the strict
limits of a Dictionary article would permit. Under these circumstances, a
detailed memoir waa written by the Editor, Mr. Sidney Lee, and was
prefixed to Volume I. of the Supplement, where it occupies nearly fifty
pages. The same volume contains, as frontispiece, a portrait of Mr. Smith
after Mr. G. F. Watts."
My Baronite did not chance to see the first volume of the
Supplement. The third volume, including the letter S, he, in
his unimaginative way, looked through to find the name
of Mr. Smith. Failing in the endeavour, he came to the
conclusion that, for highly honourable if somewhat quixotic
reasons, it was omitted. He does not regret the misunder-
standing, since it gave him opportunity of paying a humble
tribute to the memory of one of the worthies of the nineteenth
century whom, when honours were being distributed among
lesser men, the Government of the day systematically ignored.
It will be as well, when a second edition of the Supplement is
called for, to insert a line in proper place among the S's, guid-
ing the searcher after truth to the George Smith memoir.
"JILL generally evinced an amiable readiness to explain any
obscurity that might characterise her discourse." Thus it is
written in Iota's latest novel, The Happenings of Jill (HUTCHIN-
SON). My Baronite, patiently plodding through the tangles of the
story, wishes he could testify that this promise was realised.
IOTA, bursting with desire to say something smart, persistently
obscures her meaning. If she would only condescend to write
unaffectedly, something might have been made of the story and
the characters that should live in it. But they must all,
especially Jill, sparkle with epigram, even when asking each
other to pass the salt. The whole thing is jerky, inconse-
quential, occasionally unintelligible. The happenings to Jill
are nothing compared with what befalls the conscientious
reader endeavouring to make out who's who, what they fought
each other for, why some make love and others get married.
"I think you understand," said Jill to her husband after he
had been some months in training. "'Oh, I understand,' he
said, very much as though he did not." Which was at least
honest of him.
In Quest of the Giant Sloth (Blackie and Son, Ltd.), by
Dr. Gordon Stables, R.N., is a thorough good tale of a young
hero and his friend, ambitious to discover a survival of the by-
gono age, who start on an expedition which leads them through
strangely marvellous lands in South America. Here they gain
more than a peep at the prehistoric Sloth, a largo creature of
a kindly nature, living chiefly on nuts. Both books are well
illustrated. Certainly this nautical and literary Doctor R.N.
ought to write a tale of the Horse-Marines. If ever man knew
all about these mysterious warriors, that man ought to be the
bearer of such a name as "Stables, R.N."
Few greater literary treats, says my Juuiorest Baronitess,
could be given to the average girl than to make her a Christmas
present of these two beautifully bound books, A Popular Girl,
by May Baldwin, and A Nest of Girls, by E. Westyn Timlow
(both from W. & R. Chambers). The first is an interesting and
brightly told story of a young English girl's school life in
Germany, where to the" heroine is unanimously accorded the
distinction of "the most popular girl in the school"; and
the second is just the sort to please and fascinate all girl
readers. Well illustrated by H. R. RICHARDS.
Pater's Book of Rhymes, by Judge PARRY, illustrated by
A. Rusden (Sherratt and Hughes), is a comical collection of
eccentric pictures and nonsensical verses of the " Shockheaded
Peter" kind, though not within measurable distance of that
immortal work. Good as a present from Santa Claus.
In The Secret Orchard (MACMILLAN), Agnes and EfiERTON
Cassel have set themselves a delicate task. To bring together
under the same roof a loving spotless wife, a faithless husband,
and the young girl with whom he has gone astray is a situation
that requires supreme skill to make otherwise than revolting.
The skill is forthcoming. So deftly do the two authors work
the web and woof of their story that there is in the reader's
mind no other feeling than one of profound interest. It is -a
fresh triumph for the system of collaboration. Where Agnes
begins and where Egerton stops my Baronite occasionally
fancies he guesses. But "the flats are jined" in such master-
ful manner that he is probably mistaken. The recurring
episodes of the narrative, up to its fine finish, all intensely
dramatic, are led up to and out of with consummate power.
My Baronite used to wonder whether, as some said, it is
true that a generation has arisen that knows not Charles
Dickens. Answer is forthcoming in the fact that during the
last year or two more than one popular edition has been
liberally welcomed. The best wine is saved to the last-
Messrs. Chapman and Hall, in collaboration with Mr. Hknry
Frowde, have commenced to issue a copyright edition printed
on the incomparable India paper that is the unique trade
mark of the Oxford University Press. By its magic art we have
beautifully printed in large type, in a dainty volume that will
comfortably lurk in the jacket pocket, novels that on their
original publication held the world entranced whilst they ran
through twelve monthly numbers. In some cases, as in that
of A Tale of Two Cities, space is found to bind up with it
another complete work, to wit, A Child's History of England.
Pickivick, running to 928 pages, has one of the charming volumes
all to itself. Increased value is given to the edition by the
inclusion of all the original illustrations.
The Sinner and the Problem (Macmillan & Co.), by ERIC
Parker, is a slight story, as wholesomely fresh and sweet as
its conception and design are original. A mere gossamer
thread of plot runs through such pleasant pages as seem
to have been written in moments of reposeful leisure,—just
as one may jot down the outcome of a reverie, and be sur-
prised to find that what commenced as a mere note had
developed into a chapter,—and then, as an afterthought, such
chapters had been strung together and connected. For, delight-
ful as it all is, yet is effort apparent in the finishing touch.
Has Mr. Eric Parker caught unconsciously a trick of Peacock
in dialogue, of Sterne in occasional abruptness, and of Mere-
dith in descriptive colouring? Excellent masters truly; but
the student's style is yet to be perfected. The short chapter
about the boy's illness is [a masterpiece owing nothing to any
writer, past or present. After penning this, he must have
trembled to know whether he had done ill or well, and nervously,
with true artistic instinct, decided to let it stand as it was.
A very little more, how little, and it might have become
"gush." As to the lovemaking in it — well, the ordinary
scenes that elaborately lead up to "proposal" and " acceptance"
would have been here utterly out of place; and so, to those
who never can have enough of a good thing and who may
inquire, as did Mr. Tony Weller regarding his son's valentine,
"That's rather a sudden pull up, ain't it, Sammy? " the author
will have a complete answer, on replying with [Sam, "Not a
bit on it; she '11 vish Ithere wos more, and that's the great
art o' letter writin'." Substituting "novel" for "letter,"
there is Mr. Eric Parker's last word—and the Baron's—on the
subject. . The Baron de B.-W.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
JACOB AND HIS MASTER.
Part III.
Perhaps the DUNCOMBKS were disposed to give themselves
airs; in their own county they were considered to do so, and
possibly they were none the less highly thought of on that
account. But, be that as it may, anybody could have told Bob
that Miss Duncombe was about as likely to bestow her hand
upon a juvenile lieutenant in the Royal Navy as upon a crossing-
sweeper. There was, however, no need for outsiders to
demonstrate a fact which his own common sense very soon
rendered obvious to him. A dinner-party and a dance in Eaton
Square, to both of which entertainments he was kindly invited,
more than sufficed to open his eyes. His eyes were sharp, and
ample leisure was afforded to him to use them ; for he did not
belong to Phyllis's world, nor—with such incessant claims
upon her—could she be expected to notice how completely he was
left out in the cold on these two occasions. So he watched her,
and, watching her, made various salutary, if painful, discoveries.
Did she, he wondered once or twice, intend him to make them?
If so, he bore her no ill-will, recognising that she was cruel
only to be kind. It stood to reason that there could be no sort
of chance for him, and he doubted whether there was much
chance for his uncle (whose ambition he speedily divined)
either. Besot by so dense a throng of lords and lordlings, she
would not, he imagined, fix her choice upon a mere Member of
Parliament who, though getting on in public life, was getting
on also in years. He did not, therefore, fall out with that
somewhat ridiculous and over-sanguine uncle of his, but main-
tained a stoical calm which it might under other circumstances
have been beyond him to compass. For Phyllis in the character
of an aunt by marriage was really unthinkable!
So the days slipped away, bringing him no fresh opportunity
—it is true that ho solicited none—for private intercourse with
a young lady whose engagements were very numerous. He met
her pretty frequently and sho treated him always with the
kindliness which their bygone intimacy gave him some title to
expect; but it was quite evident that his absence would have
passed unnoticed by her had ho seen tit to sulkily absent him-
self. Only on the eve of his departure to join his new ship did
she of her own accord make an appointment with him. Jacob
had to bo restored to her keeping, and when he mentioned that
ho would be leaving the dog in Eaton Square that afternoon,
she said:
"Bring him at six o'clock, then, and I will give you a
farewell cup of tea. 1 ought to be at a garden-party at that
hour, but I think I will have a headache instead, and let my
mother represent the family."
Whether her head was actually aching or not when the
obedient Bob arrived, she certainly looked as though it might
be; for there were dark semi-circles beneath her eyes, and she
owned to being rather out of spirits. Every now and again,
she explained, life presented itsolf to her in a difficult and
perplexing aspect; every now and again she felt very deeply the
need of some disinterested and trustworthy friend to advise
her. In other words, sho could not make up her mind whether
she wanted to marry or not, and her parents, who had quite
made up their minds that they wished her to do so, were of
little assistance. They left her practical freedom of choice;
only they expected her to choose Homebody, and entertained no
doubt that she would comply with so reasonable a demand.
The above confidence was not, it need scarcely be said, at
once reposed in Bob Ckackoft, but was tlie outcome of a
protracted colloquy and of a sober and diffident request on his
part that he might be regarded in the light of the desired
counsellor. Phyllis may not have intended her appeal to be
responded to exactly in that spirit—she seemed, indeed, rather
to lose interest in the subject from the moment that it began to
interest him—yet she could not, surely, have desired him to
make a fool of himself and embarrass her by proclaiming
sentiments of which sho was far too clear-sighted to be ignorant.
Such, at any rate, was his belief, and he was not ungrateful to
her for the delicacy with which she had nipped his nascent and
manifestly unrealisable hopes in the bud. She, for her part,
was grateful to him—or declared she was—when he placed
himself without reserve at her disposal.
"Drop me a line at any time," said he, "and you shall have
an honest opinion by return of post. I don't pretend to know
much of the world, and the odds are that I shall know nothing
at all about the men who may want to marry you; but if you '11
tell me just how you feel, I shall understand fast enough what
advice to give you. Everything is sure to depend, you see,
upon your own feeling."
Everything was, in truth, so sure to depend upon that that
the necessity for an adviser was not altogether conspicuous;
still, most of us, when we request advice, only mean that we
should be glad of support, and very likely that was what Miss
Phyllis meant when she wound up with: "Well, I shall be
guided by you, then. Anyhow, I shall take no decisive step
without consulting you. I can't tell you what a relief it is to
feel that there is somebody in the world who can contemplate
me and my poor little affairs in such a thoroughly friendly,
unselfish, dispassionate way! Jacob is a great comfort; but
then Jacob, I am afraid, is hardly as unselfish or as dispassionate
as he ought to be."
Dispassionate. the poor dog was not; for he had deep
affections and invincible prejudices. Nevertheless, she might
have allowed him some credit for unselfishness, considering
how strongly it was in his mind to share the fortunes of his
recovered master and how submissively he obeyed that master's
orders to remain where he was, in charge of his mistress. As
on a previous occasion, Bob kissed him at parting, and it may
be that, after Bob had left, the precedent of that dim and
distant occasion was followed by the pair who remained behind,
all by themselves.
*****
Theodore Cracroft was a clever man, and a successful one;
but he was not much of a shot. One cannot expect to have
everything, and he was conscious of haviug obtained more than
ho had any business to expect when he was invited to stay at
Horsley Park during the shooting season. The fact of his being
so indifferent a performer with his gun was, indeed, rather a
matter of congratulation than otherwise, affording him, as it
did, an excuse for remaining at home with the ladies and
proving, as it certainly seemed to do, that his presence w-as
desired on other grounds than those to which his fellow-guests
were indebted for Air. Buncombe's hospitality. His suit, in
short, was progressing and prospering; Phyllis, during the
week which he had already spent under her father's roof, had
bestowed upon him some marked signs of favour; while her
parents, if not enthusiastic, had the air of being resigned to
probable future developments. Her parents, he perceived,
would never offer serious opposition to a will stronger than
their own, and although he was no catch in a pecuniary sense,
he began to see his way to a largely increased income. For the
Kirkhall coal-mine held out every promise of paying handsomely.
It was, therefore, with a light heart that he lay in wait for and
overtook Miss Duncombk in the park one bright, frosty autumn
afternoon, and it was with some discomposure that he heard
the abrupt query which his appearance drew from her.
"Oh, Mr. CraCROFT," said she, "is what they tell me true?
Is it a fact that you have bought Kirkhall from your nephew
for a few thousand pounds, and that this horrid coal mine,
which is going to disfigure the neighbourhood, will make a
millionaire of you?"
Tur.oliORE smiled and replied that ho was afraid it would
fall very far short of doing that. He admitted, however,
having purchased the estate—" for which," he added, "I paid
Bob his own price. Of course, it was a mere speculation on

my part, and whether it will turn out -well or badly for me is
still quite uncertain."
"My father says," observed the girl, "that it is quite
certain to turn out most profitably for you. He also says that
you are an uncommonly sharp hand at doing a stroke of
business—which seems to be true. Only I can't admire you
as much as he does on that account."
"My dear Miss Dcncombe, are you accusing me of having
swindled my nephew?"
"' Swindle' is an ugly word, Mr. Cracroft; I haven't used
it. But to do so extremely well for yourself at the expense
of a mere boy, and of one who was your ward only the other
day, too — we.ll,
frankly, that docs
not strike me as
pretty behaviour."
Theodore was no
fool. He saw at
once that there
was but a single
safe course for him
to adopt, and he
took it without
hesitation.
"I am not in the
least ashamed of
anything that I
have done," was
his calm response;
"yet I must own
that I have felt
sundry qualms of
conscience about
it of late, and what
you say confirms
me in an intention
which I had al-
ready almost
formed. 1 shall
write to Bob imme-
diately and offer
to let him off his
bargain."
This was bold

very unlikely to

Nevertheless, she temporised.
Mr. Cracroft, she said, must wait for a final answer—would
have to wait several weeks; five or six, perhaps. (" How
long," she inwardly wondered, "does it take to get an answer
from West Africa ? ") But although she could not consent to
an immediate engagement, she did not mind telling him that,
as at present advised, she would a little rather marry him than
anybody else whom she knew.
Pressed to give reasons for the very long delay which she
demanded, she ended by avowing that she wished to take the
opinion of a friend who happened to be away from England.
Naturally, she declined to mention that friend's name, and

posed to powerful temptation), but it achieved its purpose
triumphantly, so far as Phyllis Di'ncombe was concerned. A
bright smile and an outstretched hand gave prompt reward to
the magnanimous proprietor of Kirkhall.
"I was sure," she declared, "that you would act like a
gentleiaan!"
She had been sure of no such thing; but it may be that she
was glad to have assurance forced upon her. Whether she was
glad to receive further prompt and anient assurances, which
she was unable to check, is another question; they did not, in
any case, take her by surprise. For some time past she had
been perfectly cognizant of Theodore Cracroft's wishes, and,
upon the whole, she rather liked and admired the man. That
is to say that she admired his talents and liked his manners,
which were suave and urbane. She was not, to be sure, in
love with him; but that was a consideration of small impor-
tance, for she had arrived at the conclusion that it was not in
her to fall in love with anybody.

"My good friend, you must have been away from town for
some time. Fact is we have been crowded out of Europe.
Our places are taken in England by our American cousins,

"You don't say so?"
"I do. There are now so few native-born Americans in

AN UNHEAL CONVERSATION.
Recorded by Archie Williams.
Scene—The Office of Works. Discovered,
Mr. AKERS - DOUGLAS, industriously
rubbing out a large pencil-drawing. To
him enter A. W.
A. W. Good morning! I 'in afraid you 're
very busy.
Mr.A.-D. What is it now? I'm worried
to death. Never had such a time in my
life! Have you come for a design?
A. W. No, for a little conversation.
Mr. A.-I). My dear Sir, I ,—
haven't a moment. But, I say,
do you know anything about
architecture? We've started
designing all the new Govern-
ment offices here. I thought
the clerks would bo able to do it
all. Save architect's fees. Do
you know the Record Office?
A. W. Oh yes! In Chancery
Lane. A hideous building.
Mr. A.-D. You know nothing
about it. We 're awfully proud
of it here. The clerks designed
it. But they get stuck over
this work, so it falls upon me.
Look here, do help mo a little!
You'll find a lot of indiarubber
in that basket. Just help me
with this design. There now,
1' ve rubbed a hole right through
the paper! Hang this architec-
ture! I shall have to take a
fresh sheet of paper, and Hicks-
Beach will be in an awful state
if we don't keep the cost of the
new buildings as low as pos-
sible. We had to pay such a
lot for those old ones on Salis-
bury Plain.
A. W. I had no idea any of
the Cabinet worked so hard.
Some of them seem to do too
little, and others too much.
Mr. A.-D. Three feet seven
and five feet six make nine feet
one. What did you say? By
the way, what height ought a
room to be?
A. \W. I should think that
depends on the length and width.
Mr. A.-D. Oh no, it doesn't! As far as
A. W. A compromise which will please
nobody. You cut little slices off the
Green Park as if it were a cake. You
can't cut your cake and have it. There'll
be a few more aimless curves at Hyde
Park Corner.
Mr. A.-D. Oh, don't bother me! What's
the width for a door?
A. W. What sort of door?
Mr. A.-D. I said a door. Any door.
A. W. I should think it depends upon
whether it's the door of a rabbit-hutch
or the door of a furniture warehouse.

Mr. A.-D. So it is. This work's so dis- I received by those howling Germans,
tracting. I wish to goodness it was as Mr. A.-D. Ah, yes! I'd forgotten.
What disgraceful violence
but I've just got a grand idea. No public
building ever pleases everybody. Even
if it's liked at first, it '3 abused after.
The First Commissioner "s abused all the
time. My idea is to build the new offices
of steel framework covered with plaster
stuff, like the Paris Exhibition buildings.
Then the design could be altered every
time there was a change of Government,
or a General Election. The clerks would
stop in the rooms all the time, as the
plaster could be changed in the warm
weather when they'd be glad of more
air. Isn't it a magnificent
notion?
A. W. Perhaps.
Mr. A.-D. I must get to work
at once. *
A. W. Then I'll be going.
Mr. A.-D. Wait one minute
and I '11 tell you a secret. I'm
going to make a design for the
American sky-scraper in the
Strand.
A. W. That hideous mon-
strosity?
Mr. A.-D, It '11 all be steel,
with stone a few inches thick
stuck on all over it. Look as
massive as possible. It will be
a magnificent building. As high
as Queen Anne's Mansions and
five times as wide.
A. W. Horrible I
Af r. A.-D. They '11 have to get
an Act of Parliament before
they can build it, and so we
can make them use my design
or chuck out their Bill.
A. W. And what would your
design be?
Mr. A.-D. That's another
secret. Promise you won't tell
anybody. All the other fellows
in the Cabinet thought the
design awfully handsome. But,
of course, they don't know so
much about architecture as I
do.
A. W. And what is it?
Mr. A.-D. Why, exactly like
the Record Office! Only fifteen
times the size! I '11 show you
my drawing.
A. IV. Good heavens! [Exit hastily.

easy to settle as Piccadilly.
A. W. Ah, I see you've settled that by
a compromise.
Mr. A.-D. Three, four, five. Five and

A graceful concession.
A. VV. When a German tries to be polite
he says " Bitte !" when he wants toenjoy
himself he drinks bitter, and whon he
Oh yes! j gets excited he is bitter.
Mr. A.-D. Excuse my interrupting you,
Alliteration not Vexation. We observe
that Mr. Hugh St. Leger, famous, like a
Royal Marine, by sea and land, has brought
out a very bright book for boys, called
Billets and Bullets. This is the kind of
title which pleases us, and we would
venture to suggest that Mr. St. Leger
might follow it with Comfort and Cannon-
balls, Rest and Hijlcs, Dinner and Dyna-
mite, Lodgings and Lances, Blankets and
Bayonets, Meat and Maxims, Sleep and
Shrapnels, Hotels and Horse-guns, dtc,

A NOBLE OBJECT.
[" A well-known young peer i« forming a leagur-

When evening dress I don to dine
At A.B.C. or Slater's,
My swallowtails and waistcoat fine
Are taken for the waiter's.
I, son of twenty earls, that boast
A marquis for a pater,
Am taken by my very host
Not seldom for the waiter.
In coronet I can't well dine, •
Save on occasions greater,
To let the other folk divine
That I am not the waiter.
A Bishop one may know as such
By apron, hat or gaiter,
But I have really nothing much
To show I'm not the -waiter.
No doubt, did we but live and move
All " in a state of natur',"
My native nobleness would prove
That I am not the waiter.
But, hidden in the hideous dress
Of those that carve and cater,
What chance has native nobleness-
To show I 'm not the waiter?
Ah! would some tailor-genius rise
Before it is much later,
Who would some evening dress devise
To make it clear to all men's eyes
That I, in spite of this disguise,
Am really not the waiter 1
A MONEY-NO-OBJECT LESSOX.
"Yoci are right, as usual, Mr. Jones—
not a halfpenny missing," said the genial
Banker to his oldest clerk.
"Thank you, Sir," was the response,
"of course it wants a little care to count
a couple of thousand pounds in copper."
"And I must tell you that we—self and
co-directors—are exceedingly pleased to
save at the expense of a new safe. Our
shareholders are so sharp about every
item nowadays."
"Well, Sir, I must confess that it would
have been more satisfactory to me if I had
been able to keep the cash in a repository.
It's not so much the two thousands in
halfpence, but you know there are so
many notes. Some of them for five
hundred a piece."
"Yes, yes," returned the BankManager,
"we all know that you have a certain
measure of responsibility, but wo have
every confidence in you."
"You are very good, Sir."
"And now I have quite a pleasantjiuty
to perform. You have been with us flve-
and-twenty years ?' *
"Twenty-six years and nine months,
Sir."
"Ah, so long? Well, it makes our act
the more defensible with the share-
holders."
"You are very kind, Sir."
"During the last twenty odd years you
have been receiving a pound a week, and
upon that modest—when we consider your
services—sum you have maintained a
wife and family."
"Thank you, Sir. Yes, my wife and
I have got on very well indeed, and,
assisted by the School Board and the
churchyard, we have managed to keep our
children out of the workhouse."
"Very creditable. But not more than
we should have expected from you. Your
connection with the Bank has been con-
spicuous for its integrity, unsolflshness,
and, in fact, all the virtues."
"You are most kind, Sir."
"Not at all. And now, to show our
appreciation of your efforts and to
encourage your juniors to further efforts
to secure our approval, we propose to
increase your salary. You are now
receiving a pound a week. With the new
year we shall make it up to a guinea."
And as the oldest clerk road the con-
tents bills of the papers, suggesting
breaches of trust amongst bank employes,
on his way home that evening, he wondered
how such things could be.

THE IDEOCRAT AT THE DINNER-TABLE.
IV.
At an A.B.C. Restaurant.
[For facts relating to the treatment of the employees of this Company, con-
sult the recent correspondence in the Daily Chronicle.]
A most engaging fancy, this of yours,
To bid me share your light ascetic meal
Amid these happily aerated haunts
Beloved o' th' people, 'lis a double boon;
First, to a liver clamorous for repose;
And, next, to that more spiritual self,
The still small inner voice, the mobile breast
Swift to expand in sympathetic mood,
Yearning to know, by contact with its kind
("Its kind," I say, since even the self-made man
Must in his humbler moments recognise
The initial aid Divinity confers
On his collaborative, handiwork),
What tho ideas that actuate the mass,
Our fellow-creatures still, though circumscribed,
Though forced by social usage to exist
Debarred from our communion—float, in fact,
Outside the orbit of our cognisance.
An excellent sausage, and the ginger-beer
Most satisfying. 'Tis a healthy change
Should lend my banquet of to-morrow night
A piquant flavour. No, I never yet
Set foot in one of these refreshment-shops
Frequented by the lower-middle class—
Is that their name? One loses touch of terms
Below a certain grade. I like their look
Of poor but honest; very decent folk.
Oh, not my first experience of the sort,
Who gave, i' th' Duchess' train, an afternoon
To charitable work among the slums;
This, with my canvass at Election-time,
Left me, I hope, sufficiently informed
O' th' life our less ambitious brothers live.
But, to return to this same Company
Whose admirable faro we here consume.
Strangely enough, I had an early stake
1' th' enterprise (what \s that? Oh, very good!
A steak! I follow you; too good, too good !),
Took up, I say, a block of shares at par
Which yield a matter o' forty odd per cent.,
Fair recompense as speculations go;
The one pound shares, however, only stand
At just thirteen, a palpable falling-off
From last year's highest; still, one has to face
These turns of fortune with a manly front;
Nice girls, the waitresses, as you remark:
Neat-handed, quick of foot, and have the air
Of self-dependence good in womankind,
And here a credit to the Management,
Domestic pillars, one may well suppose,
With daughters of their own, and know the nee;ls
Of delicate natures. Ah! you have the facts?
Ten shillings a week at start, and live outside,
Paying for daily dinner, fares and dress,
Save always aprons—these a gift express,
With washing o' same thrown in? God bless my soul,
What^would you have? How often must T urge
The peril o' pauperising our employed
By largesse overlaid on market's price?
Already one deplores a growing taste
For lavish luxury in the working class,
Fostered by whoso rashly advocates
A wanton superfluity of wage!
And you, who call yourself philanthropist,
You would divert them down the primrose path
That leads to feathers, ribbons, silken blouse,
Stockings of lattice-work and such-like gauds
Invoked by art to lure the guileless male!
Ten shillings! 'Tis a sum should surely leave
An ample scope for all permissible joys,
After the outlay due for dress and board
And lodging—What? they make them live at home
I' th' family circle? There again you havo
A wise provision lets the Company save
What else had gone to waste for weekly rent
In houses possibly inimical
To morals; ay, and so the margin swells,
If not beyond the dreams of avarice,
Yet to a point should well suffice a taste
Bounded by virtue. Here I take my stand
On elevated ground, you '11 please observe,
Contending, past all laboured argument,
How the divine Commercial Principle
And what I deem the true Philanthropy
Work ever—watch but closely—hand in hand.
Pardon! The shilling underneath your plate!
You disregard the notice, clear enough,
Defending all gratuities under pain
Of instant exile. There, once more, I trace
A timely providence exercised to spare
Our clients' pockets, and the self-respect
Of these young women. That's an honest type,
The girl that takes your money by the door!
Fine drawn, you think, about the face of her?
Effect, perhaps, of forced economies?
Some careless customer who may have passed
Bad money or short; they have to make it good
Out of their wages? Well, and what of that?
The rule is vital, else a perilous field
Were opened up to frailty.
There's my brougham,
And Thomas, nose aloft in silent scorn.
Frankly, one trifles with one's dignity,

Well, he had one loverly daughter/—the

cold, horty gurl (not littruly cold, of
coarse, ass if she haddent enuff close on,
or coodent get to the fire, but cold indiss-
persisshon.) They orl fell in love with
her and side hevilly and orl that sort of
rot, you know, for she was butiful and
well dowerd, for the old Squier was rich as
Greaskl's, and quite beyond the dreams
of average. But she ternd a deff ear to
orl.
Arfter menny years when this pearless
buty was getting a bit long in the tooth
(ass our coachman ses of the horses), a
dashing young feller with curling locks
and black eyes—I meen natchral black
eyes, of coarse, not the black eye you get
when you've bin fiting sum feller arfter

sellibrated pack of foxface—oh, blow it,
foxhounds I meen. Each day he orlways
rode the same coal black stead witch cood

And the black-eyed Brunette, gathring

i charged the gump and alited safely, but
owing to his horse giving way in its
bohind legs, the feller slipt litely orf,
over his tale, and lay insenseless upon the
floor. Instinktivly, the Squier's daughter,

A LITERARY STANDPOINT.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Two dainty and delightful books have lately come from the
press. A Little Book of Light Verse, with an introduction
and notes by A. C. Deane (Metiiuen), and An Anthology of
Humorous Verse, edited by T. A. Cook (Virtue & Co.). The
one editor, it will be noted, speaks of "light" verse, the
other of "humorous," but, though at first sight it would
appear fairly easy to make and keep the distinction, a glance
at the two booklets will show how often they have overlapped
one another. This fact is not stated as an argument against
buying either for the very small price charged by the pub-
lishers, but rather as an incentive to the purchase of both,
for it may be truly said that both Mr. Deane and Mr. Cook
have performed their tasks with zeal and discretion. No
lover of the lighter muse should lose this opportunity of
adding to his collection these two examples of infinite riches
in a little room.
My Baronite's impression on taking up Prosperous British
India (Fisher Unwin) was that Mr. Digby had lent the weight
of his deservedly high authority to strengthen the common
impression that the people of India owe much to British rule.
This turns out to be an innocent mistake. Mr. Digby, when
he talks of prosperous India, "writes sarkastic," as Artemus
Ward used to say. In his last Budget speech Lord George
Hamilton, addressing a hostile critic, observed, " You speak of
the increasing impoverishment of India, and the annual drain
upon her as steadily and continuously exhausting her resources.
I assert you are under a delusion." A similar view of the
situation was, at other times, taken by the present Viceroy,
and by Sir Henry Fowler, Lord George Hamilton's prede-
cessor at the India Office. Mr. Digby undertakes to prove the
assertion the Secretary of State «ombats. This he does by
laborious research and voluminous quotation from official
papers. He demonstrates that, so far from increasing in pros-
perity, the people of India are overtaxed beyond compare, and
the process of treading them down is going forward with
increasing severity. It is a weighty indictment ho challenges
Lord George Hamilton to disprove. Probably the Secretary
of State will be too busy to accept the invitation. All directly
concerned in the welfare of India will find this remarkable
book worth close attention.
Now this, if you like, is a really seasonable book for all Christ-
mases. The name? Why certainly. Fairy Tales from fla?is
Andersen (Wells Gardner, Darton & Co.)., ,
S. Baring-Gould's latest book, entitled Orettir the Outlaw
(Blackie and Son), is a capital story for boys. The author
recounts most romantic adventures, and every youth of spirit
will appreciate such thrilling scenes as "exciting fight of
Grettir" with twelve "bearserks!" wrestle with Karr in "the
chamber of the dead!!" defence of the dying hero by his
younger brother!!! Effective illustrations by M. ZENO Diemer.
The Firebrand (Macmillan & Co.), by S. R. Crockett, ought
to be welcomed by any melodramatist in search of materials
for a stirring sensational drama. Scene, Spain, where the
"three musketeers" have their analogues in El Sarria,
brigand, Itollo, the Scottish swashbuckler, and John Mortimer,
English traveller in search of "good goods." A romance of
the early Carlist wars, tempore Mendizabal, banker, specu-
lator, and Prime Minister. At first, tout va bien, then, after
three hundred pages or so, when The Firebrand begins to
flicker, comes the chance for experienced skippers. It is
somewhat fatiguing to be always fighting and burning and
scragging, capturing, being captured and escaping, and all this
interspersed with a little love-making. The dish, as set before
the Baron, had it been half the size, with a third of the
seasoning, would have been twice as good.
Mr. Harry Furniss, like Ulysses, has travelled far, seeing
much of cities and men. Unhappily, as appears from Tlie
Confessions of a Caricaturist (FISHER UNWIN), they have,
in the main, failed to please him. Another voyager was
"disappointed" with the Atlantic. Harry Furniss, survey-
ing mankind from Liverpool to New York, from Adelaide
to Dublin, confesses them failures. At home the Royal
Academy pleased him not, nor the National Portrait Gallery
either. In the United States he couldn't get along with
the genial Major Pond. As for Australia, "it is patchy. That
expresses everything Australian." Exit Australasia. But there
is compensation, and Mr. Furniss finds it in turning from other
people and their work to pleased reflection upon his own. There
is a pathetic chapter in which he demonstrates that Lika Joka
fizzled out not because it was a failure, but by reason of its
success. "My one mistake," he writes, "in publishing was
that having started a success, Lika Joka, I let it drop to take
up another." The other was the Pail Mail Budget, which he re-
christened The New Budget. Following the fashion of successes,
it died very few weeks after its birth. When Mr. Furniss gets
away from contemplation of unique example of perfection his

book is amusing and interesting. Its
best things are the account of his deal-
ings with Lewis Carroll in performance
of his commission to illustrate Sylvic and
Bruno. Here Greek meets Greek, and the
native fractiousness of Harry Furniss is
overwhelmed by the superior quality and
persistence of the author of Alice in
Wonderland. Another excellent study,
full of humour, both in the letterpress and
the illustrations, is that of the former
custodian of the Press Gallery in the
House of Commons, in charge when Mr.
Fcrniss entered upon a scene where he
speedily earned renown. Admirably told,
too, is the account of his presiding at the
dinner of the Thirteen Club, a body of
gentlemen who delight in flouting common
superstitions, who dine thirteen at. table,
pass under a ladder on the way to] the
meal, cross knives and forks, spill salt,
and in other fashions defy fortune. The
work, with its abundant illustrations,
many of them new, is sumptuously pro-
duced in two volumes.,
The Baron, whose ancestor was in the
very front rank of those undaunted war-
riors who compelled King JOHN to sign
the Great Charter, welcomes exuberantly
the English Coronation Records as brought
out in quite royal style by Messrs.
Archibald Constable & Co., Ltd. This
is indeed a subject for a Constable to
take up. And it is edited by Mr. Lego,
M.A. Which Legg? The right Legg, of
course, namely, Leopold G. Wickham
Leoo, M.A., of New College, Oxford. A
Coronational work. Here is given the
history of "the Coronation oath." Why
was the form sworn to by Richard Cceur-
de-Lion ever altered? It is good enough
in all conscience. But what a mighty
trouble! Yet a King who has had such
experience in Masonic ritual, having
been Grand Master of The Craft, well
knows that not one jot or tittle of a
ceremonial that occurs but once in a life-
time can be slurred over or omitted. A
King, or Queen, of England ought to be,
as a first consideration, a patron of the
drama, as all the "stage directions" for
the Coronation instruct every actor in the
pageant as to their "stage-business" in
"the theatre!" See page 365, where
only the technical abbreviations of R.,
R.H., etc., l., L.H., etc., are wanting to
make the printed and published form of
the Coronation "as good as a play."
"After all said and done" comes a
homely finish, summed up thus, "Which
being done, the Archbishop and Bishops
will divest themselves of their copes, and
leave them there, proceeding in their usual
liabits." Isn't that a real touch of nature?
"Their usual habits." Some Bishops to
their homes; some to their friends'
houses; some to their hotels; and not a
few to the Athenseum, to chat over the
chief events within the Abbey on that
exceptional day. Then from the library
shelves a Right Reverend with a taste
for "swate poe-thry" might take down
the Ingoldsby Legends, and, in "Barney
Maguire's Account of the Coronation" in
1888, he would read—
"Then the Lord Archbishop held a goulden dish up
For to resave her bounty and great wealth,
Saying, 'Plase your Glory, great Queen Vic-tory!
Ye '11 give the Clargy lave to dhrink your
health !"*
Even Thackeray's Irish "pomes," as
that about the "Crystial Palace" for

ful Hibernian rhymings of the Reverend

strikes the open-minded

"Captain Fred S. Brereton," to whom

able.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [December 11, 1901.
THE "IBIS" CLUB.
Everyone -who has seen Mr. Pjnero's
depressing drama, Iris, will remember
th« scene in the last act in which Afol-
doiiado, transported with rage, destroys
the furniture and ornaments in his very
unattractive flat. He will recall the sigh
of satisfaction which arises from the
house as half-a-dozen detestable pieces
of china are swept in ruins from the
mantelshelf, and an "occasional" chair
of detestable design is shattered to frag-
ments.
Where does all this undesirable bric-a-
brac come from? It is a professional
secret; but Mr. Punch has no hesitation
in revealing it. It comes from the Iris
Club.
In the early days of the run of the
play poor Mr. Bourchier was compelled
to purchase these articles. Rumour
speaks of the genial manager, disguised
in a beard and a brown ulster, haunting
old furniture shops in Fulham and search-
ing feverishly for "bargains." Finding
this too fatiguing, he next endeavoured
to arrange a contract with a firm in the
Tottenham Court Road for a weekly con-
signment of them. And when this scheme
fell through, an attempt is believed to
have been made to lay down a year's
supply to mature in the cellars of the
Garrick Theatre.
Happily the Iris Club came into exis-
tence, and Mr. Boi rchier was saved
from all further trouble on this head.
The Club undertook to provide cheap
chairs and china to any amount for Mal-
donado's flat, on the sole condition that
Maldonado would break them. The Club
now consists of several hundred members,
and every member has the privilege of
contributing one undesirable object per
week from the furniture of his household
for Maldonado's use.
It is needless to say that the success of
the institution has been enormous, and
that the secretary is besieged with
applications from would-be members.
Everybody who has a chair which his wife
inherited from an aunt, or a middle-
Victorian vase on a pedestal, or a bust of
a statesman under a glass case—and who
has not?—clamours for admission. It is
not too much to say that half the
respectable households in London are
cursed with the possession of some in-
cubus of this kind which they have not
the moral courage to destroy. For these
the Iris Club is a God-send. A card with
the mystic letters I.C. is put in the
window, the Club's furniture van calls,
and the offending object, which has been
surreptitiously placed in the hall, is
silently removed. A night or two later
the happy owner, lurking at the back of
the pit or the stalls, watches with a smile
of triumph the destruction of his hated
property at the hands of Maldonado.
Indeed, so great is the anxiety among
Londoners to get rid of their unsightly
furniture at Mr. Pinero's expense, that
the entrance-fee of the Club has had to be
raised more than once, while owners of
more than usually atrocious pieces of
china are believed to have attempted to
bribe the secretary to procure their ad-
mission. It is hardly necessary to say,
under these circumstances, that Maldonado
is at this moment perhaps the most popular
character in London.
The only crumple in the rose-leaf of
the committee's content arises from this
necessity of limiting the membership of
the Club. This exclusiveness springs
from no paltry spirit of class prejudice.
There is no class in London, from the
highest to the lowest, which is not blighted
with the possession of furniture and bric-
a-brac which it would bo happier without.
It is due solely to the inadequate accom-
modation at the disposal of tho Garrick
Theatre. From time to time a note, polite
but plaintive, arrives from tho stage-
| manager requesting the secretary not to
send any more van-loads of Maldonado
pottery for the present, as there is no
room for them. Then a halt has to be
called, the Club's vans cease to go their
rounds, and no more chairs and tables are
despatched until the stock at the theatre
has been reduced to more manageable
limits.
Meantime, more than one suggestion
has been made for dealing with this
unfortunate congestion at the Garrick
Theatre. One idea is tliat Mr. Pinero
should at once write another play in which
furniture is destroyed in every act, but
Mr. Pinero is understood to object to this.
Another and a more practicable scheme,
however, has since been propounded, and
this may possibly be carried into effect in
the near future. This consists simply in
modifying tho stage " business " in ActV.
so as to widen the area of destruction.
Hitherto Maldonado has been contented
with sweeping off the mantelpiece some
few articles of china and breaking a
solitary chair. According to the new
stage directions he will, on the departure
of Jris, set to work in a business-like way
to demolish the furniture with a hatchet.
This will enable him to deal with bulkier
articles, and will at the same time provide
a more popular ending for the play.
But even without this projected improve-
ment tho service rendered by the Club to
London aesthetically has been incalculable.
The drawing-rooms, and still more the
spare bedrooms, of its members have taken
on quite an altered appearance since it
came into existence, and before the play
is taken off it is hoped that the last
Maldonado vase will have disappeared
from their happy homes. Nor will the
good work be carried on only in London.
For when Iris goes on tour affiliated clubs
are to be formed in the various provincial
centres, and wherever Mr. Pinero's play
halts for a night or two a selection of the
most atrocious-furniture and mantelpiece
ornaments contained in the town visited
will be delivered at the stage[door for the
use of the company.

FROM A BACHELOR UNCLE'S DIARY.
wo'. My Nephew's "Braking Up."
Monday.— Letter from Max "enounc-
ing" (sic) date of Christmas "braking
up" entertainment. Formal invitation
from School Committee enclosed. Awful
nuisance—shall have to go.
Thursday. — School entertainment.—
Ushered in to Gymnasium, decorated with
evergreens, "Welcome to Our Guests,"
legends, &c. Sat on wooden form. So
hard—reminded one of one's schoolboy
days—quite brought the scent of the
boot-leather and pewter ink-pots across
the gulf of years. Hate sitting on back-
less bench. So wearing. Sat immediately
behind last row of schoolboys. Boys all
spotlessly clean and tidy, wearing "Mary
Ann " collars and Eton jackets. Noticed
that most of them sucked sweetstufl or
surreptitiously cracked nuts. Kept sharp
look-out for shells.
At eight o'clock precisely (just when
one ought to have been commencing cosy
dinner, instead of, as in my case, wrest-
ling with indigestion from having dined
at six), Head-master, wearing govvn and
familiar "mortar-board," closely followed
by about a dozen assistant masters
similarly arrayed, troop on to platform,
and sit behind long green-covered table,
on which are ranged the prizes. Boys
cheer—faintly—as Head-master advances
to edge of platform, and with imperious
gesture, raises hand for silence.
"Beast!" exclaims boy nearest me in
aggressively loud tones—then finding that
several people in vicinity are looking to
find culprit, little wretch stares hard at
me—feel most uncomfortable—wish boys
would not do this sort of thing. Head-
master, sharply looking at me (why me?),
says: "Er—er—er—hrrr! Ladies and
Gentlemen. You will doubtless be ex-
pecting a few words from me about our
School." (" No fear !" from stolid youth,
munching bun, " had a jolly sight too much
of that, already.") "But, alas! 'Tempus
fugit,' and of the precious hours, can any-
thing truer be said than 'Pereunt et
imputantur'?" (Head-master evidently
very pleased at having so opportunely
unburdened himself of some of his super-
fluous stock of Latin.) "Time will not
permit me to do more than tell you of our
steady progress. I will just read our
Honours List, and then we must proceed to
our programme without delay."
"Old rotter!" scornfully murmurs boy
with red hair and chubby cheeks, as he
pockets half-finished apple.

Brief recital of honours gained by
students follows, and then, amid noise
of shuffling feet, wooden forms knocked
over, etc., some twenty hoys rise, leave
auditorium and trip over their own feet
on to platform. Aggressive air of con-
fidence about them — doubtless inspired
by numbers. One boy, with hands in
trousers pockets, begins whistling. So
friendly. Head-master glares. Boy sub-
sides incontinently.
Consult programme. Item I. — Glee,
"My Love's a full-blown roue."
Herr Splitzen Seltzer, musical director
of school, rushes on and, turning his back
to audience, raises baton, with a "pst,
pst!" for silence. Boys shuffle feet about
afresh, and after a laboured "one, two,
tree!" from-their leader, whole force of
chorus let go concerted howl, lyrically
informing us, with q uite needless emphasis,
that their collective love was a "full-
blown rose." After repeating this sev-
eral times, Tenori (together with truly
excruciating Alto) shriek:
"My love's a fool"
"My love's a fool"
"My love's a fool blown rose!""
The Bassi then corroborate the asser-
tion by growling out:
"A fool . . . blo-o-o-own . . . rose!"
Boys clear off platform, and Master
Moodler, pale youth with generally
unwholesome appearance, advances to
edge of dais. Master M. clearly nervous.
Long time arranging music, persistently
dropping one leaf as fast as he picks
up another. So harassing. Peel sure
Moodler will break down. Herr Splitzen
Seltzer, glaring through spectacles,
strikes preliminary chords on piano. Find,
on referring to programme, that Master
M. is to sing "The Good Rhine Wine."
By his present appearance should say
that the "Good Rhine Wine" had not
agreed with him. Master M., in quavering
tones, begins. Voice from back row of
boys' benches shouts encouragingly,
"Cheer up, muttonhead!" and singer
at once collapses, bursts into tears, and
hurriedly leaves platform. So sad.
Recitation next. Max and Tommy now
come and sit by me. Tommy says in loud
tones, "I say, Uncle Charlie, do you see
old Stoggins up there? that chap who
looks as if his hair had got moth-eaten?"
Try tosilence him. No use. "Well, we're
going round to serenade him to-night."
"Yes," chimes in Max, "we're going to
sing, 'We '11 hang old Stoggins on a sour
apple tree!' You must come with us—
you '11 enjoy it awfully."
Have since heard that "old Stoggins's ''
sister was sitting immediately behind us
—so pleasant.
Took earliest opportunity of escaping,
and returning home — most wearisome
drive and very cold.
Saturday.—Letter from Max, describing
rest of entertainment.

Miss Short. "Isn't my name an absurd misfit, Mil. Long?"
Mr. Long (thoughtlessly). "Yes, kathee. If you could have mine it would be all
right, wouldn't it?"
Miss Short. "Oh, Mr. Long, this is so sudden!"
Dear Uncle Charlie,—When you left,
Brown major let off a ressitation, it was
sutch orfle rot. He stuck out one arm ass
stiff as a railway sammyforc and kept
saying, about every half minute, "But
Brutus was an honourable man!"
Well, who sed hewassent? Why did
he—1 mean Brown major, not Brutus—
want to reppeat it so orfen? I did get so
enoide at first, but arfterwards we all
jest yelled with larfter until Brown
simpelly had to shut up. Old STOGGINS
was l'ewrious; he got in an orfle rago and
sent word down that heed give ns all a
thousand lines. Sum masters are bease,
arnt they? Well, wo took joly good care
to deserve the 1000 lines ennyhow, for
drecktly it was over and while tho Parents
and things were stuffing cake and sherry
in the tuck room, wee startid out and
pulled Stoggins'S gate orf its hinges and
chucked it into the swimming bath. Wont

Smearyun darkness, he carnt possibly spot

Richly gemmed, and coiffeured tresses
Wafting perfumed airs Elysian.
Other times apparelled sadly
In a sombre black or brown,
Or a grey—which fits so badly—
And with which you wear a frown.
In what guise you have surveyed me
Pleading tremblingly my passion!
What quaint signals have you made me
Not to talk in such a fashion!
My affection as a mother
You have viewed (with consternation)
As some family friend or other,
As an aunt or poor relation.

Half the riches in your care 1
And so well you guard your treasure
As to fill me with despair!

MORE BILJTE-
RAL CYPHERS.
A Startling Dis-
covery.
We have re-
ceived the follow-
ing remarkable
communication
from a correspon-
dent. As a contri-
bution to the
secret history o f
the present time
it appears worthy
of the most
thoughtful and
anxious study. He
writes :—
"The other day
I took up the Nine-
teenth Century and
glanced at an
article by Mr. W. j
H. Mallock on
The Biliteral
Cypher of Francis
Bacon, a book by
Mrs. Gallup. I
should mention
that up to that
time I had been
a light-hearted,
easy-going, care-
less man, plump
and rosy, blessed
with a healthy
appetite and sound
sleep, and fond of
any exercise in
the open air. I
read that article
once; I read it
again carefully;
I began for the
third time. By
degrees it cast a
spell over me, and
the horrible fasci-
nation of those
groups of a's and
b's caught me in a
charmed web from
which 1 could not
escape. All night
long I struggled
with that weird
alphabet, until at
abbba, baabb, abbaa, auaba, aabbb. Not
many days ago 1 should have said,
jeeringly, that this must be the bleat-
ing of a flock of sheep. But now I
know that it represents the letters P, u,
N, C, H. It is to you, Mr. Abbbabaabbabb-
aaaaabaaabbb, that I reveal my discovery.
"For a week I studied this cypher. I
hardly ate, I hardly slept. I became pale,
haggard, nervous. After days and nights

last I could write of relaxation
My brain whirled. For-
merly I never could understand how that
I could happen, but now I often feel it dis-
tinctly. I thought that to read some light
literature would divert my thoughts, and
I began a leading article in the Times.
Suddenly I perceived a letter not precisely
the same as the others in the line. My
brain began to whirl once more, but, after
binding a towel soaked In cold water
round my head, I started afresh. With
of almost ceaseless work, I felt the need a powerful magnifying glass I soon
found more letters,
and spelt out, in
the Baconian
cypher, H, A, T,
F, I, E, L, D.
"By this time
my head had oon-
pletely dried my
towel, and my eyes
swam. I rested
for a moment and
pondered on this
marvellous dis-
cov e!r y. The one
Minister who
avoids speaking,
who, when he does
speak, says as
little as possible,
and in that little
gives the minimum
of information, is
not really silent.
The descendant of
the great Burleigh
writes, in the
cypher of the great
Bacon, hidden,
like his, in con-
temporary type, a
secret diary which
future generations
may interpret and
peruse. To them
will be revealed
the thoughts, the
diplomacy, the in-
tentions of the
great statesman.
I was staggered!
Then I soaked my
towel again,
rubbed my eyes,
and slowly spelt
! out the following
| words. Sometimes
i I could not under-
stand the meaning.
In such a case I
have given the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DISSIPATED DAMSELS.
Ou, A Novel Working Party.
[" Novel-writing has become the selected dissipa-
tion of the dear devoted woman who in early and
even mid Victorian days filled her left-over hours
with the construction of blobby wool cushions and
slippery bead mats "—Wettmintter Gazette.]
The scene is the draiving-room in Lady
Clarice Culture's town house. It
is luxuriantly furnished. Complete
silence feigns. Disposed about the
room are some dozen small tables, at
each of which is seated a young lady.
All are in various stages of mental
perturbation, seriously engaged in
tvriting novels. Lady Clarice rises
and goes to the sofa, in which she sinks
languidly. It is ten minutes to four,
and a footman and a maid servant are
creeping noiselessly about with tea
things. As the sugar-tongs rattle
Lettice, who is writing at a table
near the sofa, looks up and glares at
the footman. Then she turns towards
Lady ClARICE.
Lettice (in a whisper). What an im-
provement this is on the dreary working
parties and unintellectual Sewing Bees
of the last century.
Lady C. ( pressing her hand affec-
tionately). I'm so glad you like it. How
have you got on with your novel?
Lettice. I haven't written a line. I
can't decide what kind of dress a middle-
aged lady—one of the strongest charac-
ters I have ever conceived — ought to
commit suicide in.
Lady C. Perhaps after tea
Lettice (clieerfully). Yes, I'm dying for
a cup.
[ENID, a slim, pretty girl, throws down
her pen and comes across to Lady
Clarice.
Enid (in undertones). The mood is
past. It is useless to sit staring at the
paper.
Lady C. What progress?
Enid. I have left the baffled Duke in the
absurdest tlx. Alfonso, the Italian waiter
from the Century Restaurant, the only
man in the world who holds the secret
of the Pinfc Pillow-Slip, is dangling over
an unfathomable abyss.
Lady C. Cruel girl, to leave them in such
difficulties I
Enid (with a faint smile). The exigencies
of tbo story demand that they should both
suffer. I would have left them more com-
fortably situated, but my inspiration has
suddenly evaporated. I should like to
have killed Alfonso before tea,—but he
must wait. (With great energy, as tea is
announced and a general relaxation of
tension takes place.) Won't it make a
splendid illustration? Can't you see the
yawning chasm, the blue sky, and the
fleecy clouds scudding across the mountain
tops, and the attenuated form of the
parchment-skinned waiter waving slowly,
slowly, in the fitful breeze? (Considering.)
Or chill night-wind? I don't quite know
which to make it.
Lady C. (sympathetically). Chill night-
wind is very poetical. ,
Enid. Yes, but fitful breeze gives the
atmosphere; it is more realistic. You
imagine Fate in the gusty breezes, moan-
ing dreadfully as it impatiently shakes the
wretched creature, like an avenging angel.
You see, the conception is so moral. One
has to think of all these things.
Lady C. Of course. It's really wonder-
ful, your talent.
fEMD smiles with approval and supe-
riority, and takes a cup of tea as
she mopes away. NINA, a smartly
attired girl, rushes up to Lady
Clarice, holding several sheets of
MS. still wet with ink.
Nina (speaking affectedly). Dear Lady
Clarice, I'm in the utmost difficulties.
All the interest in my book is centred in
the caprices of Madame Bolero a fashion-
able Bond Street dressmaker, and really
it's too silly, but I simply cannot recon-
cile her actions with her temperament.
And now I must either make her an
ordinary private lady or alter the whole
plot. Isn't it positively sickening?
Lady C. (assuming a tragic interest).
Most perplexing.
Niiui (gazing ruefully at MS.). I have
been working up in the last fifty pages to
a dramatic "curtain," and now, unless I
can alter it, I get an anticlimax in the
conservatory, where Etxidne—I do hope 1
have made her sympathetic—meets the
man whom she thinks is her lover, but
who is, of course, the ex-burglar butler
decamping with the plate-basket under
his Inverness coat.
Lady C. But do butlers—cr—wear Inver-
ness coats?
Nina (quite unabashed). Oh! in books,
Lady Clarice, butlers dress absurdly. I
shall make him eccentric in other things.
(Suddenly looking at MS.) Oh! how
stupid! I have made Etxidne clutch him
by the arm on which is hanging the
basket.
Lady C. (with brilliant insight). Of course
she would suspect.
Nina. Yes (pondering). Urn! Well, I
must make her absorbed
Lady C. What in, dear NINA?
Nina. I—I haven't quite thought, but—
cr—something. I can see the situation
exactly.
[Lady Clarice rises and approaches
ETHEL, who sits dreamily nibbling
her fingers.
Lady C. Well, and how are The Impres-
sions of an Impressionable Girl getting on?
Ethel (looking up through her glasses).
Can you tell me who suggests the covers
of the books?
Lady C. The publisher sees to all that,
I fancy.
Ethel. So I imagined. In'my Impressions
I am going to insist on a pale heliotrope
cover with a shower of violets. The
Impressions of will be at the top of tho
cover, and from tho letters the violets will
rain down, almost covering An Impression-
able Girl.
Lady C. But won't it be a little difficult
to see what the title is?
Ethel. Possibly. But then, you see, the
idea is so intensely artistic. The violets
typify the things of the world which play
on the emotions. These things se over-
whelm the Impressionable Girl that her
personal being is drowned in a sea of
emotion, and she must be considered not
as a girl but as a successive train of
sensuous emotions.
Lady C. (totally at a loss to understand
the "idea"). How delightfully simple, and
so artistic! But will the public see it?
Ethel (scornfully). Dear Lady Clarice,
does the public ever see anything?
And
[fa cut short by footman, who hands a
tray. Ethel takes a cup of coffee,
black and strong. Mrs. Fencer,
a bright, mature lady, edges her
way towards Lady Clarice and
draws her down on the sofa.
Mrs. P. Oh, my dear CLARICE, I 've
made my hero such a delightful wretch.
He falls in love with every female char-
acter in the book—novel idea, isn't it ?—
and swears enough to—(raises her hands
and laughs gaily). Of course nothing
really bad. But it's such a relief, after
receiving notice from one's cook, and
being obliged to remain silent through it
all, to be able to sit down and have a real
good swear—on paper.
Lady C. Dear Dora, your last book, I
remember, was very racy, although you
didn't find a publisher.
Mrs. F. Oh! they tell me that every-
body pays to have their books published
nowadays. We poor unknown paupers!
The great unprinted!
[Laughs heartily. Lady Clarice rises
to say goodbye to Myra, a pale,
nervous girl with a pinched, wan
face.
Lady C. Must you go, Myra? Have you
finished your short story yet?
Myra (in a monotonous, expressionless
voice). No. I have only been writing it
two years. It will take mo five. I do
not believe in inspiration. The theme
requires the utmost delicacy of treat-
ment. A word too few or too much, a
superfluous comma, could mar the whole
effect, so subtlo is the harmony. Tho
style must be in perfect keeping with
the theme, and one such as can alone
illustrate it. I study Maupassant and
Pater. Goodbye. Next Thursday as usual?
Lady C. Yes, dear.
[Myra'S departure is the signal for the
others to take their leave, and the
"novel " working party breaks up
as the scene closes. W. H. M.

UNITY AND UNANIMITY.
A Meeting op the National Liberal Federation in the Stone Age.
"The Chairman remarked that Liberals had now arrived at a point where they could sink all differences that had occurred between them in the
past." The Daily Jfewi said, "A great victory was won yesterday at Derby for the cause of peace, sobriety, and common-sense."
WHAT RETAIL TRADE IS COMING TO.
[" The tendency is towards abolishing the shop
and substituting the reception room. From the
newest houses of business the counter has dis-
appeared and rounded arm-chairs appear to har-
monise with elaborate wall-papers and electric-
light brackets."—Court Journal.]
"Now," said the lady, when she had
settled her feathers, assumed herdiamonds,
and smoothed out her train, "are you
quite sure the drawing-room is in order?"
"Yes, Madam," replied the powdered
footman.
"Is the five-o'clock tea ready?"
"Certainly, Madam," returned the
neatly attired parlour-maid.
"Is the Yellow-Green Russian Boudoir
Band prepared ?''
"Assuredly, Madam," responded the
conductor, in a handsome uniform, braided
with gold and silver and studded with
precious stones.
"I suppose in the library all the
papers, reviews and magazines are
ranged in order?"
"I have seen to that, Madam," smil-
ingly put in the head of the literary
department.
"Then may wo assume that the Em-
porium represents a mansion worthy of
Grosvenor Square?"
"Absolutely," replied the enormous
staff.
"Then open the doors, for at last wo
are prepared to sell, amongst other manu-
factures, a halfpenny reel of cotton."
And the public were admitted.
DECEMBER.
(A slightly previous Poem.)
The old year is slipping
Away. As he goes,
Jack Frost is a-nipping
Our fingers and toes.*
Now Yuletide reflections,
Box, present (with bill),
And Christmas confections
The atmosphere fill.
The bosom parental
With love doth expand;
The card sentimental
Is sent o'er the land.
Now pantomime's glories
Each schoolboy shall prove,
With horror ghost stories
Their hearers shall move.
The mercury's dropping
Uncommonly low,
Fair damsels are shopping
With cheeks all aglow.
With parcels they 're laden,
With wonderful toys
For wee, lisping maiden,
Or rosy-faced boys.
* Is he? but "there's many a slip" between
prophecy and fulfilment, and more slips when
"Jack F." arrives.
The mistletoe bough doth
From ceiling depend,
And blissfully now doth
A permit extend.
It bids man and maid to
Preserve a quaint custom,
And be not afraid to—
I think we can trust 'cm.
The carols are cheering
The night with their lays,
Their music, I'm fearing,
Has seen better days.
The postman is knocking
From morning till night,
The kiddies their stocking
Hang out with delight.
The dancer is gliding
The ball-room around;
The errand-boy's sliding
On slippery ground.
The skater is greasing
With ardour his skates,
The chance of its freezing
He patiently waits.
Now relatives gather
In country and town,
In spite of the weather,
The old year to drown.
Success to such meetings
In cottage or hall!
With tine Christmas greetings,
Good luck to us all 1

JACOB AND HIS MASTER.
Part IV.
Theodore's conjectures, during the evening and night, assumed
definite form. Absurd and provoking as it was of the girl, there
could be very little doubt but that she proposed to consult Bob,
and a less capable Mentor she could hardly have selected! After
breakfast, on the following morning, her lover, who knew that
she had retired to the library to write letters, took heart of
grace to follow her thither, with the intention of temperately
pointing out to her how foolish it was to evade responsibility
in a matter which concerned herself alone; and an unfortunate
thing it was for him that she had been called away the minute
before he entered the room, leaving a half-written sheet and a
hastily dropped pen upon the blotting-book which at once caught
his eye. Why, he subsequently asked himself with much bitter-
ness, did he yield to an ignoble impulse and, snatching up that
relinquished document, carry it to the window? Equally
informing, equally ignoble—and how much safer !—would it
have been to master its contents without laying hands upon it.
But, the room being rather dark and his sight none of the best,
he acted as described, thus obtaining full confirmation of his
suspicions. Miss Phyllis reminded her dear Bob of a promise
kindly made by him previous to his departure from London, and
stated that the emergency to which she had then alluded as not
unlikely to arise had now actually arisen. "Yesterday after-
noon your uncle honoured me by an oiler of marriage, and what
reply to give him I don't know. Of course he is not young,
and he is no sportsman, and many people would call him rather
a bore; yet I am not sure that I should not prefer him in some
ways to the rest of them. As far as I can judge, he is an honest,
trustworthy sort of person, and"
At this point the writer had been interrupted, and the morti-
fied reader came perforce to a pause. It was well enough to be
deemed honest and trustworthy—even at a moment so ironically
inappropriate—but who could be the people who were credited
with a disposition to pronounce so brilliant a personage as Mr.
Theodore CRACROFr, M.P., a bore? Never until now had it
occurred to him that such people existed, and the mention of
them vexed as much as it astonished him.
"Well, well! Listeners hear no good of themselves," he
muttered, with a wry smile, and he was about to replace the
candidly unflattering letter which he had taken the liberty of
examining when he was brought up short by a loud, menacing
growl.
"Get out, you ugly brute!" he exclaimed, apostrophising
Jacob Faithful, who, with bared teeth and a back like a boot-
brush, stood facing him. But Jacob declined to get out and,
what was much more awkward, declined to let Mr. Cracroft
get out either. Always prone to take it for granted that, when
left in a room, he was also left in charge of all that it contained,
Jacob (who, moreover, did not like Mr. Cracroft) strongly
suspected that this was a case of attempted larceny. At any
rate, he judged it prudent to keep that gentleman penned into
the embrasure of the window during his mistress's absence—
which plan of operations he was very well able to execute.
Perhaps Theodore was not a particularly brave man; perhaps
most men, situated as he was, would have employed the alter-
native threats and blandishments to which he had vain recourse
before deciding to risk being bitten through the calf of the leg.
Be that as it may, he was still a prisoner when Phyllis walked in
and perceived at a glance what he had been about. She seated
herself at the writing-table and, looking the culprit full in the
eyes, said composedly, "When you have quite done with my
letter, Mr. Cracroft, perhaps you will kindly give it back to
me. It is unfinished, as you see."
There was absolutely no reply to be made, save that which
Theodore, with a sickly grin, did make. "Perhaps you will
kindly call your dog off, then; I can't give you anything until
I am set at liberty."
"Jacob, come in I " said Phyllis.
"E—r—r—r—h'm?" growled Jacob interrogatively, with his
head on one side. "Do you think," he seemed to suggest,
"that it is safe to let this miscreant go?"
"Yes," answered Phyllis; "he won't run away. You were
quite right to detain him, but you can release him now."
She snapped her finger and thumb at Jacob, who obediently
raised the siege, and Mr. Cracroft proceeded to make out as
good a case for himself as forensic ability could make out of a
hopeless one. He received a patient hearing, followed by a
polite, but firm, condemnation.
"You have told me all that I wanted to know, thanks,"
Phyllis said, " and I need not now trouble my correspondent.
The excuses which you plead may or may not be good ones; it
is a matter of taste and opinion, I suppose. But, personally, I
should not care to marry a man who holds your ideas of honour-
able conduct; so we will consider that question finally settled,
please."
Being unable to shake her decision, he was fain, in the sequel,
to bow to it. All that he obtained from her, before quitting
the room and the house, was a promise that she would not
betray him, and what he chiefly regretted, while making
preparations for departure, was that he had already despatched
a Quixotic and uncalled-for epistle to Bob. It was also a pity
that he had in that epistle spoken of his engagement to Miss
Duncombe as an accomplished fact, although, to be sure, this
was unlikely to affect his nephew's reply in an adverse sense.
Bob might be a fool, and might be jealous—was, indeed, pro-
bably both—but it was to be hoped that he usbis alike too proud
and too much of a gentlemen to be spiteful.
As for Phyllis, she rubbed her hands and told herself that
she had had a lucky escape, while Jacob concurred, thumping
the floor approvingly with his tail, which he wagged straight
up and down, as of yore. She did not, under the circumstances,
think it necessary to communicate with Bob, from whom she
received, some weeks later, a rather formal missive of con-
gratulation upon her supposed imminent marriage.
"I should have thought," the young man wrote, "that Uncle
THEODORE was getting rather long in the tooth for you; but
that, of course, is no business of mine. I hope you will both
be very happy, and that the Kirkhall mine, which he most
generously wants me to take back from him (aa if I could
possibly accept such an offer!) will make yon tremendously
rich. Please give my love to old Jake. Sir George Downes,
who was our Admiral on the Mediterranean Station, and was
awfully kind to me, is at Portsmouth now. He thinks he may
get me appointed to the command of a gunboat after we have
finished this job, and, if so, I should bo able to relieve you of
the old dog. I daresay you wouldn't be sorry to hand him
over; for Uncle Theodors and he never hit it off particularly
well together."
Phyllis did not think this a nice letter, and, therefore, took
no notice of it. The writer would doubtless soon find out that
he had been misinformed with regard to her and his uncle, and
in the meantime it was interesting to hear from somebody who
had spent the preceding winter at Malta, that Sir George
Downes had a remarkably pretty daughter, with whom Bob
Cracroft, amongst many others, was believed to be much
smitten. Still more interesting was it to learn, not long after-
wards, from the newspapers, that Lieutenant Cracroft, R.N.,
who had been hit by a slug in one of those little wars of which
the newspapers and the nation take but scant cognizance, had
been invalided home, and was making satisfactory progress
towards recovery Tinder the hospitable roof of the Admiral
commanding-in-chief at Portsmouth.
Now, it so happened that Miss Duncombe had friends in that
neighbourhood, who had often asked her to stay with them,
and who were only too glad to welcome her and her dog when
she made so bold as to offer them a brief visit. Likewise, they
willingly placed a carriage at her orders on being casually

informed that she rather wanted to drive
into Portsmouth. "In order," she ex-
plained, " to look up a sort of protSgS of
mine—a poor boy in the Navy who has
been sent home wounded from Sierra
Leone or somewhere, and is being taken
care of by the Admiral's family." Thus
the well-nigh convalescent, but still re-
cumbent, Bob had a delightful surprise
one afternoon when good-natured Lady
Downes threw open the door of the room
in which he was lying and announced:
"I havo brought an old friend to see
you."
The most trusty of old friends, in the
person of Jacob, promptly announced
himself by leaping on to the sofa and
smothering his prostrate master with
moist caresses. By the time that he had
been persuaded to put some restraint
upon his emotions Lady Downes had re-
tired, and Miss Duxcombe remained the
sole claimant upon the invalid's atten-
tion.
"How awfully good of yon!" he grate-
fully exclaimed.
It must be owned that Phyllis did not
at that particular moment look so very
good. Her features, it is true, expressed
a certain disdainful compassion, but there
was a hard light in her eyes, and her
words, when she spoke, were not words
of pleasantness or peace.
"Oh, not at all," she made cold'and
careless reply. "I am staying with some
people near here, so I thought I might as
well take this opportunity of restoring
your dog to you. I am glad to see you
looking so strong and cheerful; your
wound was only a scratch after all, 1
suppose?"
"Not much more," answered Bob,flush-
ing slightly. "I have had some bother
with the surgeons, but I'm getting;all
right again now. You want me to relieve
you of Jake, then?"
"Well, you seemed to take it for granted,
when you wrote, that I should be glad to
be relieved of him."
"All, but that was because I thought—
however, I was mistaken, thank goodness!
You never answered my letter, by the
way."
"Did it require an answer? You will
have heard, no doubt, from your uncle
that I was not entitled to the congratu-
lations which you were so amiable as to
offer me."
Bob nodded. "Yes; he told me the
engagement was off."
"Off !—had he the impertinence to pre-
tend that it had ever been on?"
Mr. Cracroft had been guilty of that
impertinence; but her displeasure was so
manifest that Bob judged it prudent to
evade the query, and crave pardon on his
own account. "I say," he pleaded, "I
meant no offence, you know."
"I take none. Perhaps it was rather
extraordinary of you, and not very flatter-
ing, to imagine—but never mind 1 Let
us talk about something else. "What a
charmingly pretty girl Miss Downes is!
I saw her for a minute just now, and I
quite understood her having worked havoc,
as they say she has, with the hearts of so
many young naval officers."
"What, Violet? Yes; she is a real
good sort. But she is going to be married
to some fellow who isn't in the service;
I forget his name."
he tell you that Kirkhall has come back,
after all, to its old owner?"
"You don't mean to say so! I thought
you had declined his offer."
"Well, I did at first; but when the coal
mine turned out to be no good, it seemed
hardly honest to hold him to his bargain.
So I handed him back his £5,000—luckily,
I hadn't spent a penny of tho money—and
he returned me my title-deeds."
"Oh, Bob! how splendid—and ut the

Vwiior. "Wkll, Joy, I am olad to see that you are not at all shy."
Joy. "On no, I am not shy now, thank you. But I was very shy when I was
HORN!"
In spite of herself, PHYLLIS'S face and
voice softened perceptibly. "Keally!
Then I must condole with you; for you
are said to be one of her victims."
The young man did not even protest
against so ridiculous a charge. "Ah,
you know very well whose victim I am,
and always shall be," he returned, with a
mournful little smile. "Of course I am
out of the question; I have understood
that all along, and I. might have under-
stood that poor old Uncle Theodore was
out of the question too. By-the-by, did
same time how utterly idiotic of you! At
this rate, you will certainly die in the
workhouse!"
"Not I!" Bob cheerfully declarod.
"There's still a chance of coal being
found on the property, they toll me,
though this first venture has failed for
some reason or other; besides, I should
be all right if I had only my pay to
depend upon. I'm sure of a gunboat
now, the Admiral says."
"I see," observed Phyllis pensively.
"And will the Admiral object to your

resuming immediate possession of Jacob,
do you suppose?"
"I don't think so. That is, if you
really want to part with him."
"It will break my heart to part with
him!" the girl suddenly and unexpectedly
exclaimed.
Bob raised his brows. "Oh, well, then
of course you must keep him. Jake, go
back to your mistress."
Jacob submissively slipped off the sofa
and trotteil across to Phyllis, who bent
over him, gazed for a moment into his
wistful face and then remarked: "But
he says it will break his heart to part
with you."
"Oh, dear, no! He isn't the dog to
talk such nonsense as that. He will be
sorry for a bit, and so shall I: but"
"Ah, exactly! That is just where men
and beasts of the male sex score! You
can do without Jacob, and Jacob can make
shift at a pinch to do without you;
whereas I"
"Eh? " ejaculated Bob, round-eyed and
aghast; for he perceived, to his conster-
nation, that Miss Buncombe was upon
the brink of tears.
"I am afraid," resumed Phyllis, with
a tremulous laugh, " that I can't do with-
out either of you; I *m afraid I want you
both."
She might have added that there was
nothing to cry about in that, seeing that
she had hitherto invariably obtained, and
was likely to go on obtaining, whatever
it had pleased her to want. Mr. and
Mrs. Buncombe were not precisely over-
joyed when they learned that their future
son-in-law was to be a juvenile sailor, who
had little beyond an unblemished character
and a certain reputation for valour to
recommend him; but their resistance was
of a feeble order, and they are, at the
present time of writing, quite reconciled
to PHYLLIS's choice. For a fresh and
highly remunerative seam of coal was
eventually discovered on the Kirkhall
estate, and Theodore Cracroft, who, in
a moment of ill-timed discouragement,
allowed wealth to slip through his lingers,
is a sad and remorseful man. It may be
that he also cherishes a grudge against
Jacob, now a very old dog; but Jacob
is civil enough to him when they meet.

head-dress was found to be the most
effective, from its hideousness, in defy-

Others lean to the theory that it was
introduced by one GriDO Kawkes, a
would-be reformer of dress and other
matters. "Whatever may be the origin,
it is certain that, in spite of its extra-
ordinary vogue throughout the xoi-dixant

have been less adapted to withstand sun,

bat, and contact with a cab-roof, or the
King's enemies. It seems to have been
in such a constant state of collapse that
hatters sold it ready crushed for evening
entertainments, when etiquette was at a
discount. It began to decline in popu-
larity after being officially adopted as
the sole item of costume by Uganda
headmen; and the last straw was when
it was manufactured of that material and
worn by coachmen in the How. It had
many nicknames, such as "stove-pipe,"
"tube," "cylinder," and a depth of
absurdity, viz., on the head of the small
public school boy, who, it must be ad-
mitted, frequently and rightly used it as
a football.

men and women. Consequently, when, as
a kind of late afterthought, he does take

to linger there and digest his dreams.
He may rise early for a lark, but he cer-

instance, however, I did rise, though it
was for a duck and not a lark. I wanted

not been for the kind permission of the

heard the story at all, I felt it only
courteous to be at the fountains, Kensing-

was standing on her head in one of the
fountain basins, a proceeding which ap-
peared to refresh her. The friend was
waddling round the edge looking very
sleepy.
"Tired?" said the one-eyed duck,
emerging suddenly from the -water. "If
so"
"Never mind, talk away," said her
friend, with a brave attempt to look alert.
The one-eyed story-teller took another
header, and started almost before her
beak was out of the water.
"When I swam up to the doll the
stupid thing was sinking, and its staring
blue eyes made me quite uncomfortable.
Then a small child, with long brown
feathers — never can understand why
human beings have no feathers except
on the head—rushed to the edge of the
water and made a horrible noise—just
like a peacock, my dear. 1 told her very
clearly that I would drag the doll to
land, but human beings are so stupid and
suspicious. She thought I was hurting
it, and squalled again. The squall so
shook her that she lost her balance and
fell in. All this time the nurse was
talking to an ugly thing, something like
a robin redbreast swelled out, the mili-
tary, as the sparrow says; but then he
travels so much more than we do. I
called out my loudest, and the nurse and
the red thing rushed to the water. The
nurse seized the child and the red thing
poked at me with his stick—I, who had
sounded the alarm. And that's how I
lost my eye. You don't catch me rescu-
ing children again."
"But you didn't rescue anyone," said
the friend, closing one eye.
"Bon't quibble," said the one-eyed
duck. "I hate quibbling when there's
a north-east wind blowing."
"Never thought ducks suffered from
nerves," I murmured, as I turned re-
luctantly to go. But a fresh surprise
was in store for me.

CIWNATC8, after being Consul in 460 B.C., retired
to his farm and lived in perfect simplicity till he
was summoned from the plough to become Dictator
and extricate Minucius from a tight comer in
whioh he was being squeezed by the £qui. After
a rapid and brilliant campaign, L. Q. C. returned
to his rural pursuits, having been absent only
sixteen days.]
I.
Then out spake Cincinnati's,
And smote upon his plough ;—
"What would ye, O Quirites,
What are ye after now?
Has oar old friend MINUCIi s
Sustained another rout,
And do you want a man of parts
To go and pull him out?
Great should*be his discretion,
High courage his should be!;
Can I be right in gathering
That Rome has chosen me f
Have I not sworn, and often,
By the nine leading gods,
That I, who once was Consul,
Have done with lictors' rods?
Did I not frankly scuttle
To yonder frugal cot,
And state aloud that I was vowed
To plough my lonely plot?
Still, when I see you standing
In such momentous need,
Looking for someone likely
To rise and take the lead;
If you are short of bulwarks
For Rome to lean upon—
Why, I'm the man to meet your plan,
L. Q., in fact, is on!"
Few were the words he wasted,
His tone indeed was blunt.
As on the nail he donned his mail
And started for the front;
And ere ten days were over—
He had the .-Kquians broke,
And two by two propelled them through
The space beneath the yoke.
Six further days (sixteen in all)—
And he unwreathed his brow,
And turned again, a private swain,
To steer his private plough.
Thenceforth he stuck to furrows,
And only stirred from home
Once, to oblige the nation
And save the life of Rome.
n.
Such was the fair ideal
That fired the people's breast;
And, Saxon, shouldst thou haply deem
Theancient times were best;
Shouldst thou enquire what parallel
Our English annals yield—
I must proceed to cite the deed
Performed at Chesterfield!
Our modern Cincinnati^,
Like him of Roman breed,
He too employed the ploughshare,
He loved the turfy mead;
Ex-Consul, Peer, and archer
Good at the long Scots bow,
Wild horses could not drag him
From whore he lay so low.
Then came the cry of England
For action bold and prompt;
He saw our plight, he felt we might
Just any hour be swamped;
It was, he owned, a crisis
That might not brook delays,
And " I '11 be with yon, Sirs," he said,
"One of thess autumn days."
Fast flew the circling soasons,
The last red leaves were gone,
When, "Ho!" ho cried, "brave men
and tried,
I'm coming later on!"
And ere the winter ended
He kept that holy vow,
And straightway on the morrow
Was back behind the plough.
Once started, you will notice,
His feat was quickly done;
He brought the ancient record down
From sixteen days to one!
Only—the actual triumph
Omitted to occur;
And friends complained that things
remained
Precisely where they were. O. S.

Dear Mr. Punch,—I note, in connection
with the Coronation, that very many
esteemed citizens are anxious to serve
the King as Larderers, Butlers, High
Pantlers, and the like. I have also a
desire to have a claim approved, which
for certain reasons I have not submitted
to the Court presided over by the Lord
Chancellor. It is that of Chief Para-
graphist-in-advance. I have written more
about the Coronation than any other
journalist, without troubling the Lord
Chamberlain or any other official. Ought
I not to get my reward in all fairness?

It's Mr. Wace. How very . . . How d'ye do?
Oh, not at all. Delightful 1 James, bring tea.
You've brought the cold in with you.—Oh! and, James, -
Don't go before I've finished speaking, please,—
Tell them to air Miss Fido's Jaeger sheets,
At once. Poor love, she's perished with this weather.
Yes, isn't it? Ah yes, the poor. Quito so!
They must. I'm sure they do. But you're so wrong,
You clergy. Yes, you are. You coddle them.
Oh, but you do, you know. You know you do.
Won't you sit down? You '11 find—oh, no, not there!
Take care! My precious Fido.' Is she hurt?
My sainty dainty! How you frightened me.

So many thanks. That silver bonbomitere.

Ah, here comes tea.
Sugar and cream? One lump? Thanks, not for me.
1 '11 wait, I think, till you have—afterwards.
Now tell me, are you fond of—yes? How nice!
Well then I must—I wonder if you'd like
To see her little things, her odds and ends,
And all her clothes—yes, Fido's. Sure you would?
Yes, get them, James, and don't forget the plates.
Oh, yes, her very own. She never eats
Off anything but silver,—never has.
Another cup? No? Well, I think you 're wise:
It does destroy one's appetite for dinner.
And—yes, my sweet, what is it? Oh, of course!
Her dinner. Yes, she always knows that word. •
Isn't it sweet of her? Yes, clever one
Shall have its little din-din by-and-by.
Oh, put them here, JAMES. Yes. And tell the cook
To mince Miss Fido's kidneys very fine,
And send them up directly they arc done.
She's positively starving, precious love.
But—are there really? Children? Very sad!
Improvidence, no doubt,—and drink, of course.
But still it's most distressing.
Oh, don't go.
It's only parish business, I suppose?
To carry lukewarm soup to some old woman,
Or—is it that? What nonsense. Let her wait.
Sit down again. Now, don't you like this brooch?
Sweet, isn't it? Oh, dear me, no, they 'to real.
Yes, diamonds. Let's see. I gave it her
This time last year. I made them put the date
In pearls. My own design. I always think—
Don't you?—that Christmas is the time we ought
To give to others of our very best.
Oh, but of course. Your Coal and Clothing Club?
Delighted. Now this bangle, don't you think
It's rather nice? A cat's-eye. No, quite cheap.
Oh, those. Her little indiarubber shoes.
Yes, for wet weather. She's so delicate,
Poor precious darling. That's her sant-de-lit:
Ileal Mechlin, yes. And here, you see, she's got
A weeny pocket for her handkerchief.
What's this? Oh, no; please wrap it up again.
She mustn't see it yet. Her Christmas-box;
A little sable coat. I've had it lined
With mink. It's—not so very. Thirty pounds
I think it was. It's much too cold for her
To be in England now that winter's here.
She simply had to have it.
M ust you go? .
Well, if you really—ah, the Clothing Club!
I quite forgot. What did I give last year?
Five shillings? Well, I '11—yes, I '11 make it ten,
And half-a-crown from Fido: twelve and six.
No, please don't thank me. It's the merest—what?
Put Fido in your sermon! But how sweet!
And what will be your text ?" The Children's Bread!"
That sounds quite charming, though, 1 must confess,
I don't see what it has to do with dogs.
Oh, shall I? Yes, of course 1 '11 come. Goodbye.

SAVOYVAL OF THE FITTEST.
Quite the best of them—well, at all events, one of the very
best of the light, tuneful and sparkling Gilbert-Sullivan
comic operas — is lolantlie, recently revived at the Savoy
Theatre. "After all these many weary years," quavers
the shaky, faithful old stage retainer of the very ancient
school of drama, "do my eyes again beholQ my long-lost
Iolanthe!"
The old typical "first night of a Savoy piece" was also
revived, at least, so we gathered from the notice in the
leading journal. Alas! not the entire audience of Jolanf/ie's
premiere could be also revived, though it appears they were
re-placed.
And what excellent stage-craft, aye, and front-of-the-
house-craft too, it was, to point the topical allusion in the
sung invocation to Captain Shaw (the distinguished Firo-
Brigade Commander of that period, now, it is to be
regretted, ex-tinguished as a fireman), by having the noble
Captain present in person, hale and hearty, towards whom
all eyes were turned and whose presence was acclaimed by
the hands that applauded the words, the tune and the
vocalisation. Ah! they understand these things down in
Savoy.
And was the Captain of the Gallant Extinguishers "put out"?
Not a bit of it. A great coup.' But how about future perform-
ances, when the first fervour of revival shall have somewhat
waned? Captain Shaw cannot be present there night after
night, and matinie after matinee? Will a double, "made up" to
resemble the Cap'en, be engaged regularly? Or will there be a
wax effigy, the very image of the original hero, seated in the
stalls, with working interior, after the fashion of tho mechanical
snuff-taking figure of Mr. Cobbktt at Madame Tussaud's, to.
which simple visitors, stumbling over his toes, used t'o pro-
foundly apologise? However, this extra attraction can be
safely left to the ingenuity of the clever management.
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!
THE Academy of December 7, in*quoting Mr. Punch's open
letter to Robert Louis Stevenson, added the information—
"Mr. Sidney Colvin has announced his intention of dealing with the
subject in his own time, which, we hore, will be soon."
With tho Academical Editor Mr. Punch likewise expresses
the same hope. But that "Mr. SIDNEY Colvin has announced
his intention" is rather reminiscently suggestive of the
street row at Ipswich, tempore Pickwiekiano, when the poetic
Mr. Snodgrass, "in a truly Christian spirit and in order that
he might take no one unawares, announced in a very loud tone
that he was going to begin, and proceeded to take off his coat
with the utmost deliberation."
Perhaps ere this number appears Mr. Colvin will have
gone in for the offender and finally disposed of him. Sic
transit HENLEY!

NON SBCUS IN BONIS.
(To the L. C. C.j
DEAR Council, take it not amiss
If I should venture to remind you
Of darker days preceding this,;
Of anxious moments left behind you.
When first for London's love you sued,
Your zeal in her affairs professing
The daily paper's attitude
Was just a little bit depressing.
Before the butterfly emerged
The chrysalis was voted evil,
And you were very often urged
To go directly to the D—1.
And yet the self-same Press to-day
Your influence for good rehearses;
Who came to scoff remain to pray,
And blessings fill the room of curses.
Our drains are yours, in every park
With classic melodies you train us,
You quench the flames, you light the dark,
And license things to entertain us.
Now at your banquets not a sound
Is heard that could suggest detraction,
You are, when loving cups go round,
The toast of each opposing faction.
If we embrace Lord Rosebery's view,
Nought is too big for you to handle,
And, in respect of work, to you
The Houses cannot hold a candle.
But, oh—verb. sap.—continue good
(Think what a transient joy the rose is !),
Lest your fond parent's praises should
Become his child's apotheosis.
ANY PERSON;
Or Grandmotherly Government.
On January the First there comes into
operation an Act of Parliament whereby
"the King's M,ost Excellent Majesty, with
the advice and consent of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal," ordains, by
the authority of the same, that "Every
holder of a licence who knowingly sells
or delivers or allows any person to sell or
deliver, save at the residence or working
place of the purchaser, any description of
intoxicating liquor to any person under
the age of fourteen years for consump-
tion by any person on or off the premises,
excepting such intoxicating liquors as
are sold or delivered in corked and sealed
vessels in quantities not less than one
reputed pint, shall be liable to a penalty
not exceeding forty shillings on the first
offence and not exceeding live pounds for
any subsequent offence," the same punish-
ments awaiting the senders for refresh-
ment.
The expression "sealed," itis interest-
ing to learn, means secured with any sub-
stance "without the destruction of which

drawn." As a matter of fact, thin strips
of gummed paper are to be the restraining
agents, and we can picture Polly or Bobby,
carelessly removing the wet labels before
arriving at the family mansion, and chuck-
ling at the result, forgetful of the parental
slap.
But the grand idea of the whole scheme
is sublime in its loophole nature. There
is absolutely no prohibition to the vendor
of intoxicating liquors to send out by
means of children under fourteen years of
age as much beer, wine or spirits as his
customers demand, to their "residences
or working places "! A corps of boy and
girl Ale-bearers will surely bo instituted
and placed at the disposal of every
licensed 'victualler. In the name of
common sense, and in the hope that the
householders will not be laying in stocks
of liquor which they cannot afford to pay
for, in order to avoid the "stopper"
hindrance, Mr. Punch presents his ideas
to the publicans and public, placing them
"under flying seal" for the use of every-
body, including the Lords Spiritual.

"STREET MUSIC."
"Music hath charms," soSHAKSPEAREsald,
"To soothe the savage breast,"
But I assured a friend one day
It might become a pest.
My friend, John Scribbles, o'er this point
Grew angry, almost coarse;
Said I talked rot, and had no soul—
He raved himself quite hoarse.
"Friend," I replied, " I know you live
In a secluded spot;
But come and spend some days with me,
To judge if I talk rot."
Quito late one Saturday he came,
And said on Sunday night:
"Excuse me if I early rest,
To-morrow I must write!"
"My dear old chap," I answered straight,
"Seek what repose you can,
It 'a precious little peace you '11 find
To write in, poor old man!"
We breakfasted at eight next day,
And as the clock struck nine,
Said Scribbles, "Ere I set to work
I '11 send my wife a line."
I went into the sitting-room
Old John not to disturb,
And, glancing at the window, saw
An organ near the kerb.
The " Oeislia," this was grinding out,
When came a German band,
Which rent the air with tunes well known
To their loved Fatherland.
A few yards lower down the street
A man on crutches stood,
Who piped a sorely piercing air
On instrument of wood.
The organ-man moved further down;
The band played sadly still,
A hurdy-gurdy hove in sight,
And set to with'a will 1
Then there arrived a pallid youth
Who grasped a violin,
He played it opposite our house ;—
Can you conceive the din?
Well, at this juncture it appeared
Scribbles knocked down his chair,
He rushed into my sitting-room,
His hands thrust through his hair!
His language just at first was,—well—
I'm glad you didn't hear;
But, strictly now twixt you and me,
For Scribbles' soul 1 fear!
At last I thought it time to pour
Into his mind some balm,
So, giving him an easy chair,
"Scribbles," quoth I, "be calm!
"I am a fixture here, alas!
You can reach home to-night;
Before you go, I think you must
Admit that I was right?"
"Yes!" Scribbles screamed, "you've
proved your point;
Such music (!) is a pest!"
Home he returned a wiser man
In search of peace and rest 1

SCENE—Bore House, Lady Blessington'S

D'ORSAY and that lady are engaged in
pinning numbers on the furniture in
preparation for the auctioneer.
D'Orsay (pausing in his ivork). Is it
usual, dear Lady Blessinoton, for persons
in our position, however insolvent, to do
this kind of thing?
Lady Blessington (meekly). It is an
American custom, I believe.
D'O. It is excessively fatiguing. (Enter
Valet.) Well?
Valet. Lord Raoul ARDALE to see you,
Sir.
D'O. The young man who saved my life
yesterday when my horses ran away in
the Park? Show him up. [Exit Valet.
Lady B. I will leave you to entertain
him.
[Lady BLESSINGTON goes out L. as Valet
enters R. with Lord Raoul.
Valet. Lord Raoul Ardale. [Exit.
D'O. My preserver! I am delighted to
see you. It is true your clothes are de-
testable, but as you saved my life I will
overlook it. [Sliakes him by the luind.
Lord Raoul. This friendly attitude is
very gratifying. It emboldens me to ask
you for something.
D'O. (alarmed). Not money, I hope?
Lord U. No, only for your assistance
in persuading Lady BLESSINGTON to let
me marry her niece.
D'O. Certainly, my dear fellow. Cer-
tainly.
Lord 11. You see, I'm really awfully
fond of her. And as I've no money what-
ever, of course I feel I can show my affec-
tion for her best by asking her to marry
me.
D'O. Unquestionably. At the same
time, I don't quite see what you 're to
live on.
Lord R. I thought of selling my Com-
mission in the Guards. That would keep
us going for six months.
D'O. I don't think selling your Cora-
mission would help you much. I believe
some people make a living by selling on
commission. But it's not considered a
genteel occupation.
Lord J{. I suppose not.
D'O. Under the circumstances your
marriage would be something of an im-
prudence?
Lord R. (depressed). So my mother
thinks.
D'O. Sensible woman! I should like to
meet her.
Lord R. You can if you like. I left her
below in the carriage.
D'O. Send her up, my dear fellow.
Goodbye. I 'in afraid I can't shake hands
with you again. Your clothes are too
depressing. Goodbye.
[Exit Lord Raoul. A moment later
enter Lady Somershire.
Lady Somershire. Good morning, Count
D'ORSAT!
D'O. Good morning!
Lady S. (sternly). Wc have met before,
Count.
DO. Surely not?
Lady 8. (bitterly). Considering that in
earlier days you seduced me under pro-
mise of marriage
D'O. To be sure. So I did. How care-
less of me to forget. But I have a
wretched memory. (Aside.) I wonder
what her name was.
Lady S. But it was not to revive pain-
ful recollections that I came here. I only
wish to ask you to use your influence with
my son to prevent his marrying Lady
Blessington'S niece. As I have known
my son for years, while you met him for
the first time yesterday, your influence
with him is naturally greater than mine.
I rely on you to do this.
D'O. I should have thought, dear Lady
Somershire, that you had had enough of
relying on me.
Lady 8. I have. (Darkly.) But there
is a special reason why you should oblige
me in this matter.
D'O. And what is that, dear Lady?
Lady S. Well—ahem—it's a delicate
thing to say; but, you see, RaolX is your
son as well as mine.
D'O. God bless my soul, you don't say
so? Why, I felt drawn to the fellow the
moment ho stopped my runaway horses.
Wonderful thing paternal instinct!
Lady 8. Considering how completely
you had forgotten his mother the instinct
is certainly curious.
D'O. Curious, but highly creditable,
don't you think? Anyhow, I'm sure he'll
see it in that light, dear fellow!
Lady 8. (horrified.) He? Raoul? But
you mustn't breathe a word of this to him.
D'O. Not tell him? Absurd! Think how-
pleased he'll be! The son of Count
D'ORSAY! What an honour!
Lady S. (bitterly). After believing all
his life that he is the legitimate son of a
nobleman he will certainly be delighted to
learn that he is the illegitimate son of a
beggar! People always are.
D'O. (shocked). My dear Lady, what
expressions!
Lady 8. Well, you are a beggar, aren't
you?
D'O. Don't let us go into that painful
question. In point of fact, you do not
think he will be altogether pleased at the
news?

Lady. "Did »ou? Well, now you'll see me goixg from a much longer distance. Goodbye!"
Lady S. I should think he wouldn't!
D'O. This is very disappointing. Must
I strangle this nascent paternal affection
almost before I have begun to feel it? It
seems hard.
Lady 8. Nonsense! If you cau forget
the mother, you can forget the son. Try

Lord R. (annoyed). Look here! just you
give me them back.
D'O. (indignant). Ungrateful son—ahem
—1 should say man! Do you mean to tell
me you don't feel irresistibly impelled to
give mo these paltry notes?
Lord R. I can't say I do.
D'O. (aside). These instincts of kinship
seem curiously one-sided. (Aloud.) I have
an idea. I '11 go to Crockkord's with
these, and if I win you shall have the
money. Tluit will help you immensely!
Lord R. Noble fellow!
D'O. (proudly). Oh, I'm awfully
generous—with Cuockford's money.
Lord R. But what will yon do?
D'O. Oh, I'm going abroad. It seems
the only honourable course when you owe
as much as I do. Lady Blessington is
selling her furniture, and that will pay
for my ticket.
Lord R. And after that?
D'O. Oh, I shall settle in Paris.
Lord R. But what will you live on?
D'O. (airily). Art, my dear fellow, Art—
and my creditors.
Lord R. (admiringly). You are so full of
resources!
D'O. And finally, when I die, 1 shall die
in my best coat and waistcoat, like a
gentleman. No gentleman could possibly
die in the sort of clothes you have on at
this moment. They have no style. I shall
stand up before my mirror and make tho

For this is the first of a set of rules,
And the gulls do as they 're told.
Then next of "a frugal lunch" they
eat,
And gaze on the wine when red,
Till at 3 P.M. the others meet
To be innocently led,
It's talk, talk, talk, for an bour or more,
And when you 've had your say,
They know as much as they did before,
And delightedly go away.
PING-PONG PROPER.
The Scene is in a large hall in an outlying
suburb, during the progress of a Ping-
Pong Tournament "open to all comers."
The hall is furnished with four trestle
tables stained dark green, across each of
which a white net is adjusted. Sur-
rounding the tables at a little distance
from them are two rows of chairs, filled
with spectators. At each of the tables
men and ladies are playing with a tense
seriousness and pent-up anxiety that is
almost hysterical. Crowded ^in the
centre of the hall and streaming up and
down the avenues between the "courts''
is an intensely excited mass of people:
local cluimpions ivitlt vellum bats
protruding from their bosoms; reverend
fathers waiting on the victory of their
unbeaten youngest; pretty cousins in
sables wanting to know when he will
play; anxious mammas with flaming
cheeks getting hints for future ping-
pong parties; besides grave smile-lorn
umpires carrying formidable scoring-
boards. It is four o'clock. The atmos-
phere is tropical. There is an incessant
ping-pong-ping- pong-ping -ping- pong—
not unlike a itiil in the Parrot House
at the Zoo. Occasional outbursts of
clapping and otlier forms of applause
add to the din. At the doorway a slim,
ascetic man is accosted by a short,
purple-faced boy three sixes too large
for his clothes.
Purple-faced Boy. Hullo, Stiggs, you
ping-ponging?
Slim Man. Yes. Thought I might as
well enter. I—I feel in a ghastly funk.
P.-f. Boy. Funk, I should think so. I've
been watching them at No. 2 table, and
they 're frightfully hot. Do you know
who you have to play? (Slim man shakes
his liead weakly.) The Catford Champion.
One of the hottest men on the cross half-
volley shots there is.
[Slim man "gives" at the knees.
P.-f. Boy. No drawing-room game this,
Stiggs. Serves at a frightful lick, with a
tricky back-hand swish-sh.
[Goes through the exact mode with
great energy, at which the Slim
Man's jaw drops. He fingers his
bat nervously.
Slim Man. (with great courage, pulling
himself together). I—1 wonder where he
is?
P.-f. Boy. Come on, we'll go and find
him. Long legs—got an en-ormous reach.
[Tliey edge their way through a cluster
of people and disappear.
*****
A lean child, with thick legs and a pig-tail,
is playing against a tall, gaunt lady,
with high eyebrows, in a black dress,
with a yellow rosette of the bigness of
a soup-plate. Near by is sitting Lean
Child's mother, a stout spreading lady
of an excitable nature.
Umpire (at side of table, drearily).
Seventeen, eighteen.
Mother (clapping furiously, and beam-
ing triumphantly on all within the radius
of her smiles). Eighteen! Well-played,
Clara! Well - played 1 (To a friend.)
Twenty's the game. Clara's a point
ahead. She's playing up. (Confidentially,
to another friend.) Never been beaten.
We've had all the lady champions up at
our place, and Clarry's beaten them one
after the other.
Umpire. Nineteen—eighteen.
Mother. Nineteen—eighteen, Clarry!
(Appealing distractedly.) A point behind!
Give her one of your twisters. Make
your balls Bhoot. You can do it with
pa and ine.
Umpire (monotonously as before). Nine-
teen all!
Mother (standing up in perspiration and
frenzy). Bra-vo!
Lean Child (ivith chilling dignity). Ma,
do, for goodness' sake, keep calm. You 're
making me look ridiculous. Remember
this is a tournament!
Mother (contritely). Oh, CLAURY! I
can't help it. My nerves are all jumpy!
[The Lean Child becomes suddenly dis-
concerted, and the Gaunt Lady
wins. Being a local "fancy," the
applause is deafening. The Lean
Child is quarrelling with ]ier
mother. The mother is expostu-
lating with the Umpire, and tlie
victorious lady is being violently
caressed by her " backers " as the
crowd surges in and veils them from
sight.
A flabby-looking youth, with woe-begone ex-
pression, is listening to a bald-headed,
thick-set little man, with heavy blonde
moustache, who has just beaten his man.
Bald-lieaded Gent. My dear chap, I
played all round him. I took every ser-
vice. He's got a drive like the Scotch
Express, but I took 'em all. And he's
one of the hottest men Hackney have.
He led me up to ten, I led him at fifteeu,
and then I got into my stride and simply
romped home, twenty—sixteen. What did
you do?
Flabby Youth (disconsolately). Gotlicked.
Bald-headed Gent. Why, what ever wer«
you doing'?
Flabby Youth (slow/y drawing from his
pocket, like a conjurer, a long parchment
bat). Feel that. (Bald-headed Gent rubs
his fingers sympathetically over the surface
and utters an expression of dismay.) Limp,
isn't it V What could you expect? I
couldn't get one drive off. Simply couldn"t
make the blessed pill travel an inch.
Worst of these halls where the gas is in
the ceiling. How's a fellow to warm up
his bat? I went up to the referee and
told him. There ought to be a fire. Next
tournament I play in 1 shall stipulate for
a fire, or a gas-stove or something, and
get my bat taut.
Bald-lieaded Gent (tapping him on the
shoulder, empliatically). My dear boy.
Take my tip and get a vellum bat. Those
parchment bats are doomed absolutely.
[Violent applause droivns further
observations.
There is a sudden movement among the
crowd towards No. 4 table. Alt the
chairs become filled, and a general
excitement prevails as a tall, long-
necked man, in a tennis shirt without a
collar, fiercely grasping a uniquely
constructed weapon, steps towards tlie
table and lightly tosses a ball tip in the
air with frightful nerve.
An eager-eyed Girl. Oh! do come, Pa.
It's the best match of the whole tourna-
ment. He 's the South London Champion.
Pa(unsympathetically). Don't thinkmuch
of his looks.
[Another burst of excitement takes
place as his rival breaks away from
a little feverish group of Ixickers
and takes up his i>osition oppo-
site his rival. He is a youth
with fan-like ears and a low
forehead.
A Curate (gratuitously, to a fervid devotee
of tlie game, seated next to him). These
men are supposed to be rather good, aren't
they?
Fervid Devotee (almost iiicoherent/y).
Good! 1 should just think they were.
It'll be a tough fight. (Nods with proud
familiarity to new comer.) I know him.
Curate (unimpassioned). Who are they?
Fervid Devotee. Tall chap's Butcher,
South London Champion. Absolutely un-
beaten. Won the Heme Hill Tournament
with ease. Nobody got near him. Little

head out of a window. Another strides
up to a fire and pokes it three times, and
then vanishes. Then couples of us walk
up and down corridors, and sigh as if we
were suffering from a nightmare, possibly
created by an indigestible supper. There
is no end of the silly thinirs we are sup-
posed to do. And what makes the matter
worse is the fact that the slanders are all
circulated on hearsay evidence. No one
has really seen us making fools of our-
selves as recounted. Now, Punch—good

(A recently deciphered MS. from Mykenai.)
Lakedaimon, 1190 B.C.—Hearing of the
■white arms of HELEN, and seeing a great
crowd of gallants in the town, all hot on
the wench, I also to Court in my best
coloured camelot chiton of flowered
tabby vest, and did enter ray name as a
wooer, my wife being in Athens. By-
and-by Helen, the greatest beauty; 1
ever saw, 1 think, in all my life, whom I
did eye mightily, being dressed this day
in fair hair, mighty pretty. With her
Penelope, a modest maid whom I did
labour to take by the hand; but she
would not, but prudently got further and
further away, and near to Odysseus. And
thou 1 fell to gazing on another pretty
maid, Helen's sister; she looked mighty
out of humour, seeing AGAMEMNON toy
with Helen's curls.
*****
119(1 B.C.—To the market place, and did
hear that Helen, as looked for, was off
with PARIS, MENELAUS being absent;
whereat much talk of war, some saying
that MENELAUS had sent ambassadors to
Uion. Fell in with one from Ithaka and
told me Odysseus was mightily against
the war, being still in love with his wife,
Penelope, and would not leave her; and
another said Agamemnon was in tears in
Mykenai because of Klytemnaistra; he
himself was mighty earnest for the wars
and another sight of Helen, and she not.
*****
1195 B.C.—To Aulis, where the greatest
concourse that ever I did see in all my
life, I in my new suit of armour with the
brazen helmet and greaves ;. cost me
thirty oxen and very fine. To Menelaus's
tent, where a great council and many
opinions about tho war, Menelaus vow-
ing that it is just and inevitable, and
that not only will we punish the evil-doer
but also gain Priam's gold ; but Odysseus
saying Helen was a mighty flirt and jade,
ill worth the spending of blood and
treasure, being as much in the wrong as
PARIS. Whereat a great shout of "pro-
Trojan " and would not hear him more.
*****
1104 B.C.—By water to Uion. Found
that the town has walls and PlilAM fifty
sens, and so little fear of Helen return-
ing yet. Sent to Hellas for battering
rams, whereby much delay.
*****
1103 B.C.—Up betimes, hearing that
battering-rams have arrived. War, so to
speak, over; and so more troops from
Hellas.

1100 B.C.—Siege still going on. Many
sick with horseflesh, and so dead.

1187 B.C.—Abroad with Menelaus, and

hag, ogling HektoR; and we falling into
discourse on women, I would needs ask
him if he still had hankering for the
jade, which he denied, but Priam's gold.

1185 B.C.—Hektor dead, and so wrote
my wifo to send no more tabby tuniques,
eager to be gone. Called by Agamemnon's

WHY NOT?
It will be remembered that not very-
long ago an American newspaper secured
a world-wide advertisement by handing
over the editing of its columns for a week
to the admired Mr. Sheldon.
A London evening paper, which need
not be named here, is following the
same policy, and is now announcing (upon
the backs of ubiquitous sandwich-men)
that it will be edited during Christmas
week by the well-known Kadical and
Labour Agitator, Mr. George Jacob
Holyoake.
It was not to be supposed that the
enterprise of this journal would not find
immediate imitators. We are, therefore,
able to announce that on the first of April
next—
The Times will appear under the direction
of Mr. Daniel Leno.
The Sportsman will bo edited by Mr.
Frederic Harrison.
Church Bells will be controlled by Mr.
Alfred Harmsworth. And
The Licensed Victuallers' Gazette will
be written throughout by Sir WILFRID
Lawson.
Nor is this system of temporary appoint-
ments to important positions to be confined
to Journalism, since we are officially
informed that on the same date—
Mr. Brodrick's post at the War Office
will be occupied by the Archbishop of
Canterbury.
Lord Kitchener's command will be
transferred for twenty-four hours to Mr.

Lord Salisbury's place at Downing
Street will be filled by Mr. Thomas
Gibson Bowles. And
The important duties attaching to the
post of Poet Laureate will be discharged
by Mrs. Jane Oakley.
In this way it is hoped that these pains-
taking officials will obtain a day's rest,
while new blood will, for one day at least,
be infused into the veins of an effete

CHEERFUL CRICKET.
["The Australians are anxious that the test-
matches of next season should be 'played to a
finish,' and the M.C.C. is considering this pro-
posal."] ■
The twenty-seventh day of the flrst
test - match between the English and

Australian elevens was full of interest.
The crowd was, perhaps, less dense than
when the match was commenced, more
than a month ago, but yesterday's play
at the Oval must have been watched by
at least two dozen spectators. The pro-
ceedings commenced fairly punctually at
one o'clock, when Messrs. Noble and
Thumper, who have been together at the
wickets for the last fortnight or so, re-
sumed their innings. On the second day
Of the match, it will be remembered, the
last English wicket fell with the score at
815. No doubt the total should have been
larger, and the extraordinary rashness of
our batsmen—who even risked a short
run more than once—provoked the undis-
guised amizement of their rivals. For
the succeeding twenty-five days, the
Australians have retained possession of
the wickets, and their methods have been
marked by extreme caution. Up to the
resumption of play yesterday, they had
lost one wicket for 128 runs.
The start of yesterday's play was most
exhilarating. Two leg-byes were actually
scored in the first over, causing 130 to be
hoisted on the telegraph board amid
tremendous cheers. And, only twenty
minutes later, Mr. TRUMPER made a mag-
nificent snick for a single in the direction
of long-slip. This brilliant hitting, as
was to be expected, caused an immediate
change in the bowling, RHODES being sub-
stituted for HaIOH at the Gasworks end.
At 1.30 the usual interval for lunch was
taken, but the players reappeared with
commendable promptitude at 2.43. A
spell of quiet play followed, though a
finely-executed leg-stroke of Mr. NOBLE'S
very nearly resulted in an addition to the
score. When, however, he tried to repeat
the manoeuvre with the next ball, he was
nearly caught, short-leg having moved up
to within a few feet of the striker's bat.
At 8.15 the teams retired for a short rest,
the score standing at the same figure as
at lunch time.
Matters became far more lively when
play was once more resumed. Two wides,
a bye, and nine singles were registered
by the scorer within half-an-hour. Finally,
Mr. Noble, whose play was of the most
brilliant description, lashed out at a ball
of Hearxe'S, and drove it to the boundary!
It is very many days since such a stroke
has been witnessed at the Oval, and it
was loudly cheered. So severely was the
bowling punished, that eleven more runs
were put on before 4.15, when the players
adjourned for their well-earned tea. It
may be conjectured that the batsmen were
then counselled to be prudent for the
remainder of the day, since, beyond some
brilliant stone-walling by Mr. TRUMPER—
who would not be tempted by slow half-
volleys to leg—the play after tea was
almost dull. The batsmen remained un-
defeated till five o'clock, when stumps
were drawn.
The game will be resumed to-day at the
usual hour. As there seems little likeli-
hood that this, the first test-match, will
be finished before the end of the cricket-
season, we understand that arrangements
are being made for its continuance next
year. A. C. D.
THE TALE OF A COD.

["A codfish has been found near Cherbourg by
some fishermen. On opening it they discovered u
volume of contemporary English poetry. The book
was quite undigested."—Daily Paper.]
Good people all, both fools and wise,
Come, listen unto me,
And you shall learn what danger lies
In minor poetry.
Near Cherbourg town there lived a cod,
Of youth and premise rare:
All blameless were the paths he trod
Among the codlings there.
The ordinary little sins
To which youth sometimes strays
lie never knew: despite his fins
Ilis were not fishy ways.
When low, he sought no fragrant cloud
To solace sorrow's stroke,
Although the bloated herrings vowed
That they were cured by smoke.
He took no alcoholic drink,
Though round the bar he'd stray;
And if a mermaid chanced to wink,
He looked the other way.
So lived he happy in his homo
As any fish might be,
Till he was tempted by a tome
Of minor poetry
A poem from the later quill
Of warlike R-Dfi-RD K.,
An ode by Sir—or is it still
Mere Mr. Alfred A. ?—
A shriek from W-ts-x, or a sigh
From Sw-xii-RNE's patriot breast,
What codling, scarcely more than fry,
. Could possibly digest?
A piece of H-xl-y kept him long,
Though all his strength he plied;
But when at last he reach a song
Of M-r-d-tu, he died.
Then, O my youthful friends, beware!
There is a baneful curso
That lurks behind, these bindings fair!
There's death in minor verse.
A GRAND OLD MARINER.
Says James Haylktt (whom Mr. Punch
hails with "three cheers," as the crew
did in the song of the "Bay of Biscay
0"), who has been a lifeboatman for fifty
years, a long-lifeboatman, giving evidence
before the Board of Trade inquiry into the
Caister disaster (in which the tough old
salt lost two sons), "The crew of the life-
Iwat did not wear life-belts on this occa-
sion, and a good job too, or there would
not have been one of them saved. They
were cumbersome, and he seldom wore
one." Does this not recall the expert
opinion of the Waterloo veteran who,
asked if he would not prefer being pro-
tected by cuirass and helmet against the
steel and bullet of the enemy, replied
that "if he had to be in
the battle over again ho
should prefer lighting in
his shirt-sleeves "? But
"cumbersome " though the
life-belts may appear to
be, and doubtless are, yet
would not the weight of ^
evidence given by the " life-
belted knights" be in favour of their
use'!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

Mr. WlLKlNS, who has done much to estab-
lish the fame of Sir Richard Burton—who
revealed to the world the merits of that far
more estimable person, Lady BURTON—dipping
his hand into the lucky-basket of the travel-
ler's chance MS., has brought forth a volume
of posthumous essays. Wanderings in Three
Continents (HUTCHINSON) comprise narratives of Burton's visits
to Medina and Mecca, his ride to Uarar, his journey to the
heart of Africa, his call at Salt Lake City, when BRIGHAM
YOUJtO was in his prime; a mission to Dahome, a trip up the
Congo, a plunge into the interior of Brazil, and a voyage
through Syria to Palmyra. On most of these enterprises —
notably his adventurous journey to Mecca and Medina, dis-
guised as a Moslem—he has written at length in familiar
volumes. These papers were prepared in the form of lectures
delivered before various audiences, and have, my Baronite
testilles, the charm of lightness of touch proper to such occa-
sions. They convey vivid impression of the dauntless enter-
prise of the pioneer of later travellers through that dark
continent which to-day is so closely interwoven with the life
of the British Empire.
Like all authors of a successful first book, Mrs. Burnett's
enemies are those of her own household. Whenever she writes
a new book, the shadow of Little Lord Fauntleroy is cast upon
it, and embarrassing comparisons are forthwith provoked.
The Making oj a Marchioness (Smith, Elder) stands the
ordeal. The story, the characters, and the surroundings are
altogether different. Mrs. Burnett has oven invented a new
villain in the person of a ruthless ayah, faithful to her mistress
with dog-like affection, pitiless to all who consciously or involun-
tarily assail her interests. Emily Fox-Seton is a fine study of a
pure-minded, kind-hearted, absolutely blameless woman. My
Baronite is aware that this is not a description of a heroine
that will recommend her to the modern novel-reader. It is one
of Mrs. Burnett's new successes that she makes her interesting,
whether as maiden or Marchioness. Lady Maria Bayne lives
up to her reputation as "the cleverest, sharpest-tongued,
smartest old woman in London." Lord Walderhurst admirably
fills the part assigned to him. He leads off in two fine scenes—
where he asks the maiden to marry him, and where, kneeling by
what the doctors thought was the deathbed of the Marchioness,
he literally calls her back to life.
My Baronite, aweary of much reading of new books, turns
gratefully to a new edition of the Essays oj Klin, just issued
by Mr. Metueun. All, all are here, the well-remembered
chapters — The Southsea House, Christ's Hospital, Mackery
End, Urace Before Meat, Mrs. Battle's Opinions on Whist, and
the rest. Musing over an old colleague at Southsea House,
"the polished man of letters" of the otlice, Lamb wrote:
"Thy wit is a little gone by in these fastidious days; thy
topics are staled by the new-born gauds of the time." It is
delightful to find afresh how little this lament attaches to
El in. His gentle humour never palls, nor does the infinite
variety of his fancy stale. The Essays are introduced by a
pleasant pre.ace by E. V. Lucas, and there are many illustra-
tions by Mr. Garth Jones. My Baronite does not care about
the binding of the volume. There is about it something alike
in colour and design that is un-Lamb-like. On the other hand,
print and paper are thoroughly satisfying.
Twenty years ago GRANT Allen contributed to a London
evening paper a series of erudite and interesting historical
notes on English towns and counties. Under the title County
and Town in England (Grant Richards) they are re-printed,
with a prefatory note by the Regius Professor of Modern
History at Oxford. In a small space Grant Allen, with prac-

towns and hamlets. My Baronite, reading the chapter dealing
with his own county, and wandering on through others, finds
an amazing measure of research picturesquely scattered.
The Baron has received a book with a somewhat severe
exterior entitled Burdeil versus Pickwick, edited by PERCY
Fitzgerald (Elliot Stock), and the Baron would most care-
fully criticise its contents in detail were he not " given pause"
on the threshold of his undertaking by the tone of this highly
respected writer's work. Mr. Percy Fitzgerald follows his
leader, the late Sir Prank Lookwood, Q.C., who in an able
lecture on this very subject, boldly attempted to whitewash
the dingy reputation of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg. The Baron
cannot deny that Mr. Km G.'s efforts, like those of his leader,
have achieved a certain amount of success. Also, Mr. Frrz G.
somewhat discredits Mr. Perker, that model of a family solici-
tor! On these grounds the Baron is decidedly anxious as to
the Pickwickian future of his Percy' Frrz. Is he going to round
on his old friends and whilom favourites'! Is he going to write
a treatise extolling Dodson-and-Foggism at the expense of Per-
kerism? Where will he stop? Will he elevate the character
and actions of Jackson, the attorneys' clerk, to
the depreciation of .Sam Weller, the serving
man'! And, being on the downward war-path,
will he stop short of branding Mr. Pickuyick
himself as one addicted to riotous living, ta
gluttonous man, a wine-and-spirit-bibber, ,a
conceited, bald-headed, elderly satyr, misleader
of youth intrusted to his care, and the ill-
adviser of virtuous maidens '.' It looks as though
Mr. Percy were about to give us a series of Fitz and Starts 1

ADDITIONAL THEATRICAL REGULATIONS.
(At the Service of the L.C. and the L.C.C.)
Not only no living person shall be introduced in a modern
play, but it shall be illegal to show hansom cab horses, hounds,
and steam launches floating in tanks. To secure safety from
fire, any member of the audience admitted by an order shall
not be allowed to take his seat unless he can show a medical
certificate warranting him certain to remain awake until the
end of the performance.
The iron curtain shall descend on the first night of a new play
when the senior critic present has had enougli of it. When
lowered, the iron curtain shall not be raised again for at
least twenty-four hours.
Not only shall authorised members of the L.C.C. be permitted
to be present at all performances of a popular character, but
the privilege shall be further extended to their wives, their
cousins, their sisters and their aunts. Not only shall refresh-
ments be illegal in the auditorium, but all over the premises,
and for a radius round the theatre of one square mile.
All the above regulations—and anything else that occurs to
anyone—shall be carried out to prove that technical knowledge,
worldly tact and general good feeling is not in any sense requisite
in the proper management of a play-house.
"Hurrah for the Cosaque! " is an old chorus that merry
families of youthful Browns, Joneses, and Robinsons might
appropriately revive and chant at Christmas time when the
kousokeeper goes to the cupboard where is kept the Christmas
crackery, and produces therefrom the "Table-decoration
Cosaques" and the "Toy Symphony Cracker Box" invented
this year by the ingenious Tom Smith. Pull away, boys and
girls! The reports that reach us from the crackers are as
startling as ever, and the sparks from the anvil of the Tom-
Smithy as brilliant.

JOCOSA LYRA.
The simultaneous pub-
lication of two antho-
logies of light verse—one
of them, by the way, is
entitled an Anthology of
Humorous Verse — leads
one to suppose that the
great reading public has
begun to take a serious
interest in verso that is
anything but serious, or,
to express the matter
perhaps with greater ac-
curacy, disguises its oc-
casional seriousness by
the wearing of the jester's
cap and the jingle of his
bells. We may suppose,
in fact, that there exists
a paying public which has
realised that the writing
of good light verso de-
mands very high quali-
ties, and that a mere
comic rattle with a liberal
amount of pnns thrown in
does not quite fill the bill.
This is a matter for con-
gratulation, since the
art of writing light verse
is not an easy one, and
the more its professors
are sustained and encour-
aged, the higher will be
their standard and the
more valuable their
efforts.
English poetry has a
majestic record of many
centuries, but it is only
in comparatively recent
times that the lighter
Muse has gained her due
recognition amongst us.
Why did she come so late
and in so timid a fashion?
Hon ace, Martial and
Catullus—what are they
but writers of light
verse? Our forefathers
read them and knew
them by heart, but those
who rhymed shunned
these shining examples,
and for the most part preferred Epics, Dramas, Odes—any-
thing rather than the sparkling little piece in. which, a
friend speaks to his friends about matters of everyday
experience, redeeming them from commonness by the gaiety
of his humour and the perfection of his phrases. I do not
forget Suckling or Prior, but they were exceptions. Our
earlier poets, when they affected humour and lightness, for
the most part trod their measure with a heavy foot. For
instance, both the anthologies to which I have referred
include Milton's "On the Oxford Carrier." Where is its
lightness or its humour? In the midst of its frisking com-
panions it has all the effect that might be produced by an
ancient war-horse, fully caparisoned, prancing about among

Or, take a much later
period, and consider
"John Gilpin." Both
collections include it.
Indeed, I suppose one of
an editor's fixed points in
preparing his selection
would necessarily bo
"John Gilpin." Shall I
be accused of treason if
1 hint that the reputation
and endurance of this
piece are a matter for
wonder? How did it,
oven in an age that joked
with difficulty, produce
so overpowering an
effect? The narrative is
bald and portentously
lengthy, the workman-
ship is not felicitous, the
theme itself is trite and
obvious. Something
there must have been in
the nature of citizens
and train band captains
and their frugal wives
that produced in the
minds of our forefathers
an exquisite sense of
incongruity, as of some-
thing that had no serious
right to exist, or, if it
did exist, was by that
mere fact intensely hu-
morous and comic, a
'proper subject for the
most obvious ridicule
Echoes of their laughter
still come to us, and
since even the echoes of
laughter are infectious,
we laugh too, though the
jest has lost its savour.
On the whole I think it
is a fairly accurate state-
ment — it is Mr. A. C.
Deane who has made it
— that the tradition of
light verse to which we
now hold was originated
by Canning, continued
by the brothers Smith,
and Anally established by Winturop Mackworth Praed.
Before that, the efforts were spasmodic, the occasional
divagations of poets who put away their thunderbolts and
sported for an hour with Amaryllis in the shade. Since that
time we have come to recognise as poets those who, liko
Thackeray, or Frederick Locker, or Calverley, or Mr.
Austin Dobson (to take a few recent examples only), were the
skirmishers of the army of the Muses, gay companions who rode
in light order with a bandolier filled with jest, and humour,
and wit. And who shall say that they cannot win a battle as
well as the Long Tom and Lyddite Shells of Mr. Swinburne?

In its best and most attractive form it requires many quali-

and friendly outlook on humanity, the outlook of a man who
has lived in the world, and is able to speak of its struggles,
and its disappointments with a humour that is always
kindly and a pathos that is never (at least, in expression)
tragic. If his verse sometimes trembles into tears it must

A CHRISTMAS CAROL.
By Charles Dickens and Toby, M.P.
No. 10, Downing Street; Chrlatmax Eve.—PRINCE Arthur, turning out of Parliament Street, walked along Downing Street
■with long stride, arms limply hung by his side, hat slightly tilted back from his feverish brow. Loft in town at this festive
time to look after the affairs of the nation, he had spent a tiring day at his desk. The night was in unison with his
faltering spirits. Fog and frost hunglover
the street. Ghostly figures, suddenly
emerging from the mist, sharply scanned
him. They turned out to be policemen,
who wondered what he was doing out on
such a night, and it Christmas Eve.
Arrived at No. 10, he fumbled at the
key-hole in vain attempt to insert his
latch-key. Now it is a fact that there
was nothing at all particular about the
knocker on the door, except that it was
very large. It is also a fact that PRINCE
Arthur had seen it night and morning all
through his official residence. Let it also
be borne in mind that throughout the day
he had not bestowed one thought upon Old
Morality. And then let any man explain,
if he can, how it happened that Prince
Arthur, having his key in the lock of
the door, saw in the knocker, without
its undergoing any intermediate process
of change, not a knocker but Old
Morality's face!
Old Morality's face.- It was not in
impenetrable shadow as the front of No.
10, Downing Street was. It had a faint
flicker upon it such as might fall on an
upturned countenance from the dying
light in the glass roof in the House of
Commons when members answer to the
cry "Who goes homo?" It looked at
Prince Arthur as Old Morality used to
look, with kindly but shrewd glance, as
if doubting whether he were altogether,
as he has described himself, "a child"
in some matters. The hair (what was left
of it) was curiously stirred, as if by
breath or hot air; and though the eyes
were wide open they were perfectly
motionless.
As Prince Arthur looked fixedly at
this phenomenon it was a knocker again.
To say he was not startled, or that his
blood was not conscious of a terrible sen-
sation to which it had been a stranger
from infancy—an earlier stage from that
of the childhood alluded to—would be
untrue. But he thrust the key into the
key-hole, turned it sturdily, walked in
and lighted his candle.
He made his way to the room nearest the doorway connecting No. 10 with No. 11, Downing Street. This was knocked
through at the instance of the Squire of Malwood when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lord Rosebbry, as Prime
Minister, was his neighbour. He (the Squire) liked to feel that at any moment, without the delay consequent upon passing out
of one front door and through another, he could seek and find the counsel and companionship of his chief. Prince Arthur
thought of this touching incident with a sense of relief. He was alone in the house. All the servants were making Christmas
holiday. It was nice to think that by passing through a door ho could, in case anything happened, be in the next house in
no time.
"Pooh pooh! " he said, when he thought of Old Morality's face where the door-knocker ought to have been. Nevertheless,
he doubled-locked the door. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his turned-down collar, put on his dressing-gown and
his slippers and his nightcap, and sat down before the fire to sup the gruel which the prevision of a faithful servant had left
ready on the hob.
Half-an-hour passed; it may have been only twenty-five minutes. Prince Arthur heard a familiar step in the passage. It
was coming straight towards the door. Whilst he was congratulating himself on the precaution he had taken of double-

locking it, the Something moved on through the massive door
and entered the room. The dying flame leaped up as though
it cried, "I know him; Old Morality's Ghost!" and fell
again.
The same fac?; the very same. Old Morality in his square
morning coat, his usual waistcoat, his trousers of the last
century, and boots of the same date. His liody was trans-
parent, so that Prince Arthur, looking through his waistcoat,
could clearly see the bookstall at Charing Cross loaded with
those newspapers ho never reads.
"How now?" growled PRINCE ARTHUR, throwing into his
voice a tone of Philosophic Doulit. "What do you want with
me?"
'• Much." Old Morality's voice; no doubt about it.
"Who are you?"
"In life 1 was First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of
the House of Commons whilst you were Chief Secretary for
Ireland."
"Can you—can you sit down?" asked PRINCE Arthur, look-
ing doubtfully at him.
The Ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace as
if he were quite used to it.
"Don't be frightened," ho said genially, warming his hands
at the fire and rubbing his leg in the place where the calf
formerly was. "I daresay you didn't expect me. I can't
stay long, though 1 don't suppose you are much troubled
with cock-crowing in Downing Street. 1 just wanted to have
a little chat with yon about Procedure in the Commons.
I hear something about you going to tighten up the Rules
so as to choke off Obstruction. I don't want to say anything
disagreeable. Merry Christmas: good-will on earth, and
all that, you know. So I won't refer to the time when
, you and GnANDOLPH and WOLFFEY and JOHN Gorst— how's
Gorst getting on? still respectful to his Chiefs, 1 sup-
pose ?—when you four did your best to make legislation
impossible.
"What I wanted to say to you is—if I may quote a copy-book
heading possibly not unfamiliar to you—when youput your hand
to the plough, don't turn hack. No half measures: till the
flowing bowl: you know what I mean. I did something in my
time to deliver the majority from the tyranny of the minority.
Never had such a chance as yon possess. You have an over-
whelming majority. The Irish Party, under the leadership of
a pinchbeck PARS'EI.L, have given themselves away, alienated
public opinion by openly declaring their intention of making
the House of Commons a byword among Parliaments, impotent,
ludicrous. Now's your time. Snatch it and do your work
thoroughly."
PRINCE ARTHUR began to feel quite at home. Had never
heard a ghost talk in so sensible a manner, or comport itself in
such homely fashion.
"Well," he said, "though unexpected, as you put it,
I'm very glad to see you again. Won't you take some-
thing?" he was about to add when, catching a glimpse of
the back of the chair through the lower part of his visitor's
waistcoat, he recognised the inappropriateness of the sugges-
tion.
■ As he looked Old Morality' edged towards the corner of the
seat, placed his hands on his knees and turned his head to the
left in the direction where the Speaker's chair is viewed from
the Treasury Bench.
| "He's going to pounce!" cried Prince Arthur excitedly.
Pounce he did, clear off his chair, through the shut and
double-locked door. Prince Arthur, his faculties strangely
quickened, could hear the pattering of his feet along the
passage.
"Pooh pooh!" he muttered as he finished his gruel, "I
don't believe my own eyes. No Foundations for Belief in this
sort of thing. All the same there's a good deal in what he
said."
A CHRISTMAS RONDEAU".
Old Father Christmas! one more joyous peal
Hails your return, your wonted gifts to deal:
You bring your blessing—Peace on earth to dwell—
To men you teach good-will, and with your spell
Calm their fierce feuds, and differences heal.
Now wondering children to their stockings steal,
And find them bulging—leg and toe and heel.
Glad at the gifts the giver's name they tell—
Old Father Christmas!
1 also join their joyful sports with zeal:
Crackers I pull, to cry the forfeits kneel,
And at Sir Roger 1 once more excel.
Yes. when each year your gladsome carols swell,
Despite time's ravages, I cannot feel

A CHRISTMAS STORY.
The Old Styi.k.
NOTHING could have been more cheerful than the well-lighted
streets. Thehollyand mistletoe glistened in the green-grocers'
windows. Toys were everywhere, and scores of happy children
toddled beside their rosy-cheeked parents full of the glee of
the joyful season, and so on, and so on, for a dozen pages.
The family party assembled together in the old ancestral hal!
was a right merry one. Tin? armour reflected back the red
glare of the blazing yule log. Dancing and flirtation and all
the brightest side of life were in evidence on all sides. What
could have been more delightful? What could have l>een
more in keeping with the gocxl traditions? And so on, and
so on, for another dozen pages.
"All." said the host, as he bid adieu to the last guest for
the last time, smiling, "what a pity it is that Christinas comes
but once a year '."
Tin: New Styi.k.
Nothing could have been more dismal than the fog-hidden
streets. The green—if there were any—could not be seen in
the fruiterers' windows. The customary cheap presents in the
toyshops were hidden by the prevailing gloom. Children by the
score shivered and whimpered as they listened to the querulous
voices of their parents. And so on, and so on, fora dozen pages.
The family party assembled together in the large dining room
quarrelled with the utmost heartiness. They had been so in-
tent upon their bickerings that they had quite forgotten to
keep up the fire. The coals were cold as the biting frost with-
out. The hall tabic; was covered with unpaid bills. County
Court summonses had been left early in the afternoon and were
well in evidence. What could have been more in keeping with
the sadness of the dismal season? What could have been more
wretched? What could have been more in keeping with the bad
traditions? And so on, and so on, for another doaen pages.
"Ah! " said the host, as he bid adieu to the last guest for
the first time, smiling, "how fortunate it is that Christmas
conies but once a year!"

SANTA CLAUS.
A Special and Exclusive Interview.
"I HAD some difficulty," writes Mr.
Punch's representative, "in finding the
old gentleman -whose views on current
topics I had been instructed to ascertain.
Everybody knew him—at least everybody
pretended to—and one little girl to whom
I applied for information was sure she
had seen him last Christmas-time creeping
up to her cot in the middle of the night.
She described him, however, as looking
'just like Daddy,' and, as I knew that
that particular Daddy owned no beard,
white or otherwise, I saw at once that her
story lacked that vraisemblance which to
a newspaper-man is more valuable than
life, to say nothing of truth. At length,
however, by dint of a lavish expenditure
of money, I found a clue, and eventually
tracked the illustrious friend of all
children to his home in a neatly con-
structed and unpretentious cave situated
not far from Hyde Park. The avenue
leading up to the entrance is composed,
if I may say so, of five hundred magnifi-
cent fir-trees, and fifteen poodle-dogs,
specially wound up to spring at an intruder
and each of them constructed with a
special and novel arrangement for barking,
guard the outer gate. Having safely
surmounted these obstacles, I was ad-
mitted by
A Norwegian Troll
of peculiar shagginess and highly curved
legs. He wore a beard at least two feet
long, reaching from his chin to the ground,
and on his head was a fanny old cap
shaped like those usually associated with
brewers' draymen and revolutionary en-
thusiasts. In answer to one question as
to whether his master was at home [he
replied, with an affectation of surliness
which could not conceal the nobility of
his character and the true kindliness of
his heart, that Santa Claus was very busy
at this particular moment, and that any-
one presuming to disturb him would
probably be converted immediately into
a story-book with brilliantly-coloured
pictures and sold for 3g. 6d. a copy on the
railway bookstalls. Being naturally of a
retiring disposition, and hating both pub-
licity and advertisement, I was just about
to turn away when the voice of
Santa Claus himself
was heard inside the cave loudly instruct-
ing his servant to admit the stranger at
once. At this the demeanour of the Troll
instantly changed, a smile spread over his
rugged Norse features, and with a low bow
he proceeded to conduct me down a flight
of golden steps into the audience chamber
of his lord and master.
My first sight of Santa Claus disap-
pointed me, and the description of it will
no doubt disappoint readers of Punch.
"We live in an eminently rationalised
world. All romances and fairy tales and
legendary myths have been carefully
smoothed out and reduced to the common
experience of every-day life, and even the
glamour of childhood has had to give way,
so we are assured, before the relentless
advance of common-sense coupled with
business methods imported from the
United States. When, therefore, I entered
the audience chamber I expected to see a
dapper gentleman in a frock-coat and
patent-leather boots, with an up-and-down
collar, a diamond-and-pearl scarf-pin, and
a bunch of violets in his button-hole. I
confidently anticipated that he would
address me in curt tones, asking me to
state my business quickly, as lie was
expecting a visit from
The Superintendent of a Toy-Shop,
and could give me only ten minutes. You
may judge my surprise when I found Santa
Claus to be just what the old, kind, cheer-
ful stories of childhood had represented
him—a hale, rod-cheeked old gentleman,
with a big white beard, his face and his
long coat and his tall boots all powdered
with snow and an indescribable look of
joviality in his clear blue eyes. "Great
Scot! " I observed, in the first shock of
my astonishment. "You don't mean to
tell me that you 're Santa Claus! Why, I
expected quite a—1—"
"No matter what you expected," said
the Saint, "here I am at your service."
"About those stockings, Santa Claus:
don't you ever find a difficulty in filling
them? Come now, you can't possibly do
the whole job yourself. Why, in England
alone there are"
"If you're going to bother me with
statistics, I've done with you. You don't
suppose I care a farthing rushlight for
all that kind of thing. I've done the job,
as you call it, for nigh on two thousand
years, and I'm not going to cry peccavi
now."
I saw that the old man was offended, and
hastened to change the subject.
"Yes," he said, meditatively, in answer
to a question from me, "dolls are still in
great request. My doll-cavern extends
underground through a great part of
Europe. Then there is the animals'

painted wood that
NO ORDINARY HORSE
can stand it. However, I don't keep
many rockers: there '» such a difficulty
about getting stockings large enough lo
hold them."
"How about mechanical toys?"
"Oh, well, of course we march with the
times, you know, and all that. There's
something about mechanical toys that
doesn't quite appeal to me, but 1 suppose
I'm conservative and old-fashioned. I
just keep a few in stock by way of variety;
but as a matter of fact, when a kid's old
enough for some of these elaborate
machinery things, why it's old enough to
do without toys altogether. Anyhow, my
visits are not required in that particular
home. The old things, I find, go down
best—dolls, animals, Xoah's arks, jacks-
in-the-ljox, and that sort."
At this moment a fearful noise broke out.
'" It "s only my dolls practising ' Papa'
and 'Mamma,'" said Santa Clause.
"Come and see them. It's really a
charming sight."
I had, however, heard enough. Thank-
ing the Saint warmly for his courtesy, and
bestowing a handful of brass tokens on
the attendant Troll, I regained the upper
air, deeply impressed with nil that I had
seen during my short visit to the Cave of
Delight and Happy Memories.
TABLE TALK.
[The Daily Mail has recently quotrJ "otne
striking farts to show our increase of luxury.]
OlTt vulgar siies decided
To take in calm content
The goods the gods provided,
Whenever they weie sent:
Their bourgeois tastes and sober
Were grateful for the boon
Of peaches in October
And strawberries in June.
But now we think it treason
To all good sense and reason
To own a taste
That's so debased,
And eat a thing in season.
When every coster's barrow
With strawberries is spread,
And every alley narrow
With strawberries is red,
It must in reason follow
That self-respecting men
Would rather die than swallow
Your vulgar favourite then.
But when the skies are snowing,
When "prices all increase,
And strawberries nro going
At half-a-crown a piece,
Then one, without forsaking
One's self-respect, might dream
Of possibly partaking
Of strawberries and cream.
You offer us green peas from
Your Surrey farms in vain;
We only look at these from
The " middle zones " of Spain;
Spring duckling in November
We reckon at its prime,
With lamb about December,
And trout ai Christmas-time.
In short, we hold it treason
To all good sense and reason
To dare to wish
For any dish
That is not out of season.

CHRISTMAS DAY, 1901.
(By one who lias been forced to keep Christ-

Puddings of plum and mine© pies too!
Hammer and nails for the holly—halloo!
(There! I've hammered my thumb! goroo!)
A romping party of girls and boys,
And a Christmas-tree that is hung with
toys
(Greed, ill manners, and awful noise!)
To the family pew while the day is young,
And a carol of love on the bells is rung
(The beautiful anthem vilely 8ungl)
At night we '11 dance till tho morn is gray,
And drink to the friends who are faraway
(Hoio fearfully ill ice shall be next day !)
THE GHOST THAT FAILED.
(A Story for the Festive fieason.)
All my life long have I desired to meet
and speak with a ghost. I am now an oldish
man with my wish still unrealised. As a
boy 1 revelled in the old-fashioned ghost
story—with gibbets and gibbering, spec-
tral lights and hollow groans, but I was
far too healthy over to bo frightened,
and though I longed to havo that deli-
cious creepy feeling, that sense of I-
don' t-know-what 's-going-to- happen - but-
I-shall-scream-in-a-minute, no ghost or
suspicion of a ghost ever came my way.
"You want to be in the proper mood,"
said my sister Neurasthenia; "read
Edgar Allkn Poe and Hoffman." I read
Poe with, I admit, a mild discomfort, but
Hoffman bored me. In despair, I took
to late suppers (lobsters, pork, anything,
provided it was indigestible); but my
cursed digestion was so magnificent that
I slept afterwards the sleep of an infant,
and only succeeded in keeping everyone
within six-room radius awake with my
snoring. Time passed on; 1 grew middle-
aged, and with approaching baldness, the
joy of feeling my hair "standing on end"
roceded into the distanco of the unex-
perienced—into the abysm of the much
unrealised. And yet I havo not given up
hope. Even now, as I am writing these
lines (1 a.m., dark stormy night—haunted
spare-room— country house — guttering
caudle), the thought that, perhaps, some-
thing may happen inspires me. I will
blow the light out and see—metaphori-
cally, of course.
* * * * *
1.15 a.m.—Havo been in darkness a
quarter of an hour. Making this entry by
the light of a match. Casement rattling,
but nothing has happened. Feel stupidly
sleepy, but horribly matter-of-fact and
tranquil—D—n! Match burnt down to
my fingers.
2 a.m.—Havo re-lit candle. Must havo
been asleep. Trying to recall dream.
Ah! I have it . . . was buying Christmas
presents with insufficient money. That's
better; not exactly ghostly, but shows a
certain vague discomfort. Perhaps now
. . . what was that? Chair turned over
outside. I walk to door and look out.
My host in dressing-gown. Says he felt
sleepless, and was taking book from book-
case outside my room when a form glided
out . . . dissolved from tho panels. Tho
family ghost! Had I seen it? Then I
lost my temper.
"You wretch," 1 said: "you inhospit-
able wretch, to keep a ghost only dis-
cernible by yourself. Hero have I been
waiting all night—done so for sixty years"
■—and then I sobbed like a child in bitter
disappointment.
"Try sleeping in the churchyard,"
suggested my friend.
"Done so for two seasons, and only got
rheumatism."
"Hopeless," murmured my' friend.
"Incurable." Then ho wrung my hand
and fled, and I returned, Ghost-less and
irritable, to sleep with my usual abomin-
able tranquillity. A. K.

OUR CHRISTMAS TEA.
Uiircijenerale Youth. "Pass the reedy caike!"
Vicar's Daughter. "If?—If?"
Unrrgeneratc Voulh. "If 'e don't I'll shove 'im is the fake!
said the sparrow, with his head inquisi-
torially cocked aside.
"Oh, the usual lovo stories—plenty of
mistletoe and pretty cousins, and the
advantages of sitting-out dances in the
conservatory, and—and ghost stories of
every kind, ghosts that aren't ghosts as a
rule;—must end up all right, you know."
"Rather saniey, isn't it ?" chirped the
sparrow. "I prefer my stories; they
really happen. Don't I forget them?
Well, I expect I should, only I toll the
Tairios, and fairies forget nothing. Listen
to this: it's more exciting than the
(luck's story. Last Christmas Kve ] was
! Hying along one of your dirtier streets the
other side of the river, when I sawa little
crowd of children peering into a flaring
toy-shop. Gracious! how bright their
, eyes were, and how flushed their faces—
much brighter than many of the children
in the big, fine streets—only dirtier, more
like we are, you know; while the other
children were more like goldfinches and
peacocks, you understand. Well, 1 flew
down, not so much for the shop as because
someone had been eating a bun, and I like
buns !" added the sparrow with refreshing
candour. "Then a man came out and
| drove the crowd away—all but one little
girl who was making a horrid noise in her
throat like a dog barking, and who kept a
blue cold nose fixed against the window.
After a while she grew tired and crept to
a doorstep. Then, of course, I knew what
ought to^be done.^and I flew away to tell
the fairies." A. R.
HYDE PARK AND THE FAIRY.
IV.—What the Sparrow saw on
Christmas Eve.
The sparrow surveyed me from a neigh-
bouring twig, with small, bright, beady
eyes. Then he winked.
"Slow creatures, those ducks," he re-
marked in a piping voice. "Pity yon
haven't got a fairy pass every day."
"Beg pardon," I observed with puzzled
politeness. 'Twas rather difficult to know
how to address a sparrow. He was so
very small, and yet looked so smart, that
any slip on your part would [be quickly
taken advantage of.
"Well, haven't you got permission from
the fairies to understand bird-language
for a time? You ought to be proud of it.
You big two-legged things are so very
ignorant of what goes on among us that
a fairy pass"
I hastened to assure the sparrow that I
was extremely grateful.
"You write Christmas stories, and all
that sort of thing, for the papers?"
I pleaded guilty.
"What do you write about usually?"
TO CIXCINNATUS JUNIOR.
FOR AMENDS.
{See last week's "Cincinnati!*.")
My Lord, if I may understand
That you at last consent to yield,
To leave, in fact, your furrow-land
And take, for good, the tented field;
(Not that you say it anywhero
In such reports as I have read;
But .Mr. Asquth, he was there,
And this is what he says you Raid)—
Kindly permit me to repent
Of that poor Cincinnatus-song.
Composed before the great event,
And proved oracularly wrong.
None gladlier than I, my Lord,
Would welcome with the coming year
Your plough-share turned into a sword.
Your pruning-hook become a spear.
For you have put one doubt to flight
In Chesterfield's vociferous hall—
Under what flag you meant to fight
(Supposing that you fought at all).
And, so you serve your country's ends,
Careless how else the issue goes,
You cannot lack for loyal friends
Except among our common foes.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
In a certain weekly paper of which he
is editor and was, if my Baronite is not
mistaken, "onlie begetter," Dr. Hobkrt-
SON NlCOLL, thinly disguised as "C-LAt'DICS
CLEAR," comforts and counsels a wide
circle of devoted readers. He has col-
lected and published his essays in a
handy volume entitled Letters on Life
(Hodder and Stoit.hton). They well bear
the ordeal. The subjects range over the
wide plain of common daily life. Amongst
the headlines are The Art of Conversa-
tion; Somo Questions about Holidays;
Tho Sin of Overwork; Good Manners;
On Growing Old; Firing Out the Fools.
This last is a trenchant utterance gene-
rated by experience during a visit to the
United States. All the essays are marked
by wide knowledge of men and books,
equable common - sense, unfailing good
humour. Even when firing out fools
Claudius Clear manages to convey the
idea that, save for a predominant sense
of duty to his country, he would, following
personal preference and apostolic exam-
ple, suffer them gladly. When writing
of books or on literary topics, Claudius
Clear walks familiar paths through far-
reaching fields. He not only reads, but
discriminates and remembers.
"Under which King, Bezonian? Speak
or die!" This is what the Baron, apt at
quotation, ajks himself while reading
Caroline,, the Illustrious Queen-Consort of

A BROWNIE STUDY.
George the Second, by W. H. WlLKINS,
M.A., F.S.A. (Longmans, Green & Co.).
Under which King will you rank yourself?
Is it to be the Hanoverian George, first of
that name, with all the Stuart vices and
none of their pleasant qualities, or King
James the Third of England and Seventh
of Scotland? The First George was sen-
sual, selfish and cruel, and the Third
James was not worth such wild enthu-
siasm as the Stuart cause aroused in
English and Scottish hearts. The Baron
would have been inclined towards "the
King over the water"; but sagely bent
on retaining his wise head where Provi-
dence has safely pla6ed it, he would have
drank the King's health and requested
him to remain " over the water," without
attempting to regain the crown his father
had thrown away, unless summoned to do
so by the nation. The most uncompro-
mising adherent of the Stuarts can now-
a-days throw up his cap for the lineal
descendant of James the First of England,
and cry with all his heart and voice, "God
save King Edward the Seventh!" But
what a set from the First Charles, blame-
less in his domestic life, to the Fourth
George (saving "Farmer George," of
kindly but melancholy memory), memor-
able as the " finest gentleman in Europe."
It needed the virtues and strength of
character of so pure and sweet a soul as

was the Gracious Queen Victoria to
thoroughly purge a court that was not so
very far removed from the open licen-
tiousness that characterised the reign
of the Second Charles so endeared to
Englishmen who "take their pleasures
sadly" as "The Merrie Monarch."
Brilliantly written, with every incident
dramatically given, and with every im-
portant character duly weighed and
valued, there is not a dull page in the
entire work. It is, indeed, one of the
most interesting, as it is one of the most
delightful, of books, sparkling with the
romance of real life, that has engrossed
the Baron's attention this many a day.
Those who have a lively recollection of
The Love of an Uncrowned Queen will be
in no way disappointed with this new
work by the same author.
The Baron de B.-W.
P.S.—Not in the regular Booking-Offlce
line is a story in the Christmas number
of the Penny Illustrated, but Mr. Latey's
Love Conquers All is worthy of exceptional
recommendation.
Recommendation for spending a really
jovial time any evening during Christmas
holidays.—Attend meeting of the Statis-
tical Society and hear a lecture on The
Absorption of Interest and its Effect on
the. Price of Meat at Berlin.

CLASSICAL SKATING.
From an ancient Fretze.
MR. NEMO'S JOURNEY TO NOWHERE.
MR. Charles Nemo was a most respect-
able citizen. He had but one failing, and
that was a lack of memory with regard
to names after the uncertain minutes of
the night. In the early hours of the
morning, when the coffee-stall keepers,
in the bleak, biting, wintry blast, were
still supplying the supposed extract of
Mocha coffee to the wayfarer, when
the policeman on duty cast his eye
on the ribald reeling home, Mr. Nemo
might still be observed by the watchmen
of the mansion flats of the West End
padding the hoof. One day Mr. Nemo,
following the milkman, arrived at his
unancestral residence, and was greeted by
his wife, who was also his pursebearer,
with the expression, "Charles, you are
unwell, you need change of air."
"But," faltered Charlie, "what about
the place, and where is the cash?"
His spouse, tremulous with delight, and

Sal! i*
It was most unfortunate. The first time Mr. and Mrs. Spool used their new motoe car to drive to the meet,
something went wrono, and the wretched tiiino bolted for fifty or sixty miles before it could be pulled up.

in her position of financial directress
imperative, kissed her husband, and
softly placed two crisp five pound notes
in his hand, mentioning a spot where
they would be happy together for, at
least, a fortnight.
Charlie wont to sleep, and, when he
woke in the morning, his fingers still
grasped the Bank of England acknow-
ledgments. But for the life of him he
could not remember the ideal spot selected
by his better-half. All he could recollect
was that itexisted in the " B's," as placed
in the ABC railway guide. He con-
sulted his friends. One man suggested
Bognor, another Brighton, a third Bourne-
mouth, and a wretch who had no sense of
human unhappiness, Bermondsey.,
Charlie finally invaded the Charing
Cross office of the Underground Railway,
and asked if he could book for Billingsgate.
The clerk in charge recommended the
Tower. Charlie thanked him, fled from
the office, and returned to the rose of his
home garden. He said, " Venetia, what
do you think of the Tower Bridge?"
Venetia answered, "Here are twenty-
five golden sovereigns for you. Let us go
to Boulogne for the Glad New Year."
Then Mr. Nemo had a glimmer of the
truth (Boulogne was in the "B's"), put
the gold in his pocket, and, just to oblige
Venetia, had no inkling of placing himself
in receipt of a Coroner's jury. In fact he
was saved from himself. This is a yarn
without any hempen conclusion.

HINTS TO BEGINNERS.
When going out before daylight after ducks, waders are advisable. Also, better tell your wife she need not
come down (just when you exrkct the ducks) and ask if you are sure you are not getting your feet wet.
AN OLD STORY.
This is the house that Jack took.
This is the rain
That came through the roof
And flooded the house that Jack took.
This is the drain
That blocked the rain
That came through the roof
And flooded the house that Jack took.
This is the builder, a local man,
Who came with five ladders, a horse and
van,
To clear the drain
That blocked the rain
That came through the roof
And flooded the house that Jack took.
These are the days—a dozen or so—
In which the water continued to flow
In spite of the builder, a local man,
Who came with five ladders, a horse and
van,
To clear the drain
That blocked the rain
That came through the roof
And flooded the house that Jack took.
This is the drawing-room ceiling white
That dripped with moisture day and night
Throughout the days—a dozen or so—
In which the water continued to flow
Unchecked by the builder, a local man,
Who came with five ladders, a horse and
van,
To clear the drain
That blocked the rain
That came through the roof
And flooded the house that Jack took.'
And this is the bill which, I'm afraid,
Will some day or other have to be paid
For mending the drawing-room ceiling
white
Which fell to the ground one sorrowful
night
Because of the days—a dozen or so—
In which the water continued to flow
Unchecked by the builder, a local man,
Who came with five ladders, a horse and
van,
To clear the drain
That blocked the rain
That came through the roof
And flooded the house that Jack took.

OUR LOCAL POLO MATCH.
Excited Drummer. "Vat*! He iss your only ball? Ach, donner und blitzes! he haf proke insider my only drum!
YOU PAY ZE DRUM, YOU HAF ZE BALL!"
THE HARBOUR BAR.
Reflections of a Patriot.
[Among the tests that differentiate true patriot-
ism from its base counterfeit, the most crucial is
that which awaits the home-coming Englishman
on his arrival at the squalid Refreshment liar at
Dover Harbour. There, too, the foreign passenger,
having avoided the fascinations of the Calais
Buffet, has his first opportunity (while waiting
an hour or so for the Ostend Mail) of checking a
British cuitine. The following lines are respect-
fully dedicated to the Dover Harbour Board.]
"Breathes there the man with soul so
dead,"
So lost to purely English graces,
Who does not, when he deigns to tread
Among the tracks of foreign races,
Thank Heaven nightly on his knees
That he is not as one of these?
Too great to count them food for mirth,
Mere stuff to whet his Attic wit od
(Since none may pre-arrange his birth,
Or be, by taking thought, a Briton),
Our patriot's heart, from pride exempt,
Feels pity rather than contempt.
When, lapped in ease (a corridor
And luncheon-wagon to enhance it),
He reaches Paris—Oare dti JVord—
After a swift and punctual transit,
And sees his trunks in ordered rows
Deposited beneath his nose,
Ah! then his backward fancy leaps
To old-world wobblers on the Chatham,
The baggage piled in hopeless heaps,
The public's hoarse "Up, Guards, and
at 'em!"
Nothing but tact forbids him to
Refer aloud to Waterloo!
He meets with men of narrow aim,
Unversed in speaking or in reading
The only language worth the name,
And puts it down to want of breeding;
One must be well outside the pale
Who cannot grasp the Daily Mail.
Brought up on British beef and fog,
He shudders through his very vitals
At fricassees (presumed of frog)
And " made-up " plates with fancy titles;
"What hope," he asks, "for men who take
No true delight in chop or steak?"
He roams their galleries of Art,
Calls them so French, so free in morals,
Misses the themes that move the heart,
Kittens at Play, or Lovers' Quarrels,
The healthy air, well worth the fee,
That breathes from our Academy.
He samples literary plays,
And finds the English version vicious,
Rashly condemns the Rostand craze
And deems D'Annunzio meretricious;
He hankers for a homely scene
Bristling with "Soldiers of the Queen."
He sits, a stalled ox, and hears,
At positively vulgar prices,
The harmony of all the spheres,
The latest Wagner-school's devices;
And o'er his soul vain longings come
For British ballads, made to hum.
But most his heart within him burns
When at the last, a home-sick rover,
Back to his country he returns
And stands upon the pier at Dover,
Watching what vision first will stir
The envy of the foreigner!
With large proprietary airs
He sees the Frenchman, pale as flannel,
Who shunned the Calais-Buffet's snares,
And fasted all across the Channel,
Now swoon with joy—his haven won—
At sight of Dover's Tea and Bun!

there has been
some change in
your duties of late
years?
Answer. So I
have been told;
but I confess I do
not find them
growing lighter.
Q. Were you not
at one time under-
stood to represent
propriety?
A. Certainly;
and my presence,
even now, is ac-
cepted as a certi-
ficate of respecta-
bility.
Q. But do yon
really think it is
required?
A. Well, perhaps
not. One's daugh-
ters nowadays can
look after them-
selves.
Q. To what do
you attribute this
change of custom?
A. Oh, of course,
to the introduction
of the American
element. Now the Yankee girl has come
to stay, "puppas" and "mummas" are
superfluous. *
Q. But can you not use your influence
in floating the more rich than well-born?
A. Not worth the trouble. Besides, as
it certainly would be a financial trans-
action, the more rich than well-born
May.

would find it "come cheaper" without
me.
Q. I don't catch your meaning. Will
you kindly explain?
A. Oh, certainly. Money is all-impor-
tant in the twentieth century, and birth
consequently may—to use a classical ex-
pression—go hang.
Q. Then you
think a million-
aire's wealth will
pass him any-
where?
A. Quite so; and
not only pass him,
but his wife,
daughters, uncles
and aunts, and
even remoter con-
nections.
Q. Then what is
your vocation as a
chaperon?
A. To enjoy my-
self instead of
sanctioning the
enjoyment of
others.
Q. Explain your-
self.
A. Why, I still
accompany a junior
to a ball, but I
dance myself in-
stead of sitting out
as a wallflower.
Does this
work well?
A. Excellently,
for us both, be-
cause my charge
has all the ad-
vantage of old-
fashioned respect-
ability without
its thraldom.
Q. And you find there is no drawback?
A. None, unless it be one of my own
making. If I deliberately determine to
cut out my charge, of course there may
be ructions. If I take away, for instance,
her favourite partners.
Q. But is this easy of attainment?
A. Depends, of course, on the appear-

ance of my charge. But, as a rule, dancing
men prefer partners of forty to young
girls. Especially nowadays, when the
dancing men happen to have reached the
age of forty themselves.
Q. Cut do men dance after they reach
the age of forty?
A. They seldom dance before that
period.
Q. Then 'your experience is that the
younger men prefer to sit out?
A. Sometimes, in which cases they
usually prefer the chaperon to her
charge.
Q. You say " usually." Why " usually"?
A. Because, when there is a smoking-
room attached to the ball-room cigars are
nearly invariably preferred to chaperons.
Q. Are there often distractions in which
a chaperon can indulge beyond dances?
A. Yes. many. You can go to a picnic
or a theatre plus supper party, or dine at
a restaurant. But this you do with the
younger men, and then you can take your
charge with you.
Q. From what you say it would seem
that the situation is reversed. On the
occasions to which you refer the charge
plays propriety?
A. Well, in some measure, I suppose
she does; she keeps her chaperon in
countenance.
Q. But is not all this extra exertion—
quite unknown to the old-fashioned
chaperons—rather exhausting?

our conversation, please ask me no further
conundrums.

and so precise his refrain, "Fresh

would entrance modern playgoers
as much as does the chant of the
peripatetic piscine merchant the
dweller in the upper circles. The
seeker after "Ole clo" is a diplo-
matist—he knows that to hunt and
run tho quarry to earth is to run
early with his brother Houndsditch

Noise is my joy, despite the L.C.C.
But let us harmonise the measure.

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1902.
OUR WAITER AT MULLIGAN'S.
Extract from the Travel Diary
ok Toby, M.P.
Won't mention where Mulligan's is to
be found. This sheet is not connected
■with the advertisement department. But
I '11 tell you about the waiter.
We were driving through a remote dis-
trict in the West of Ireland. The horses
broke down at a point an hour distant
from our destination. Mulligan's stood
by the wayside. It was not an attractive
hostelry. But it was aut Mulligan's out
nultux. So wo engaged beds for seven
at Mulligan's.
When we came upon our waiter he was
spreading the table for luncheon. The
meal was confected of some
tasty odds and ends of salt
bacon, tempered by thin cuts
of tinned tongue. But the
magnificent manner with which
the covers were laid, the air
with which the banquet was
served!
Some sixty winters had
sprinkled snow on our waiter's
massive head. Calling in Art
to redress the balance with
Nature, "restoratives" had
evidently been applied. In
places the dye had caught on;
in others the effort was not
v holly successful. The general
result was a little patchy.
However, we were too hungry
to be critical.
Our waiter was arrayed in a
dress suit which probably be-
longed to Malachi, when he
wore the collar of gold he won
from the proud invader. The
trousers were shiny about the
knees, and a little short over
the ankles, displaying to fuller
advantage the patent leather
(cracked) shoes. The waistcoat
had an obstreperous habit of
rising above the collar of the
coat at the back of the neck, apparently
trying to overtake the black tie which
overlapped the shirt collar. The dress
coat was curiously embroidered with
relics of mustard, deposits of pepper,
and rich sauces.
These are trifles. It was the bearing of
our waiter, his voice, his gestures, the
bend of his head and the wave of his
hand when he spoke, that impressed the
casual wayfarer. In repose—as when,
with noiseless footfall, he glided around
the table frowning at importunate flies—
he recalled Mr. Turveydrop. Aroused—
as when the Member for Sark asked if
anything was going to follow the odds and
ends of bacon—he, for a terrible moment,
realised one's impressions of John Kemble.
When he had occasion to leave the room he
didn't walk out like an ordinary waiter.
He made an exit.
"Got any potatoes?" asked the Commo-
dore.
Mr. Turveydrop-Kemble regarded him
for a moment with reflective gaze, as if
wondering why anyone could have made
him .1 Baronet. Then, flinging open the
door with his left hand, he pointed to the
indeterminate distance with his right, and
as he passed off the stage, said in a deep
voice, " I go to enquire." After due in-
terval he returned, carefully closed the
door, and, striding up to the Commodore,
stood for a moment mastering his emotion.
"I thought," he declaimed, in tone of
deep resignation, "that potatoes were
going. 1 lind they are not."
"In fact, they 're gone," said the Com-
modore, flippantly.

"I MADE UGLY FACES AT YOUR STUCK-UP SISTER THE OTHER DAY.
BUT I s'l'OSE SHE DIDN'T SEE ME?"
"Oh, yus, she did. But she thought they was natural."
Mr. Kemble-Turveydrop (tragedy now
predominant) mutely bowed his head. He
had spoken his part at a particular cue.
There was nothing more in "the book,"
and, like all loading actors, he abhorred
gag—by others.
"Now what can you give us for
dinner?" said the Commodore, leaning
back in his chair and folding up somebody
else's serviette. (We all had someone else's
napkin. By taking thought, one or two of
the party managed to find a comparatively
clean inch on the one dealt out to them.)
Some bits of cheese, apparently broken
up by a hammer earlier used in the coal-
cellar, followed the odds and ends of
bacon. The Commodore, kindest-hearted
of men, anxious not to hurt anyone's
feelings, assumed the satisfied air of one
who had lunched off a plate of turtle soup,
half-a-dozen oysters, and a young grouse.
"Wo don't want much for dinner," he
continued, affably. "Soup, fish and a
joint, you know."
Mr. Kemble-Turveydrop, standing by his
chair in the attitude of chief mourner, eyed
him sidewise with compassionate glance.
"We can't promise you fish," he said,
with a tear in his voice. "We have it on
the premises, it is true. But I can't
recommend it—at least, not to yon."
This with a gracious wave of the hand
comprehending the company. Apparently,
to meet local taste, they keep fish at Mul-
ligan's till it becomes odorous.
"You shall have ox-tail soup," he
added, appropriately changing from the
Kemble to the Turveydrop manner.
"Ah," said the Commodore, feebly
smacking his lips. "And what
joint?"
"Duck," Mr. Turveydrop-
Kemble decisively answered.
"And" (here he almost ogled
one of the ladies) " for a third
course, apple tart."
He was better than his word.
When we sat down to the ban-
quet we found that roast beef
had been added to the menu. It
was thrilling to hear him, re-
lapsing into the Kemble charac-
ter, breathe into the ears of
the guests the hollow whisper,
"Roast duck or beef?"
When all were served he re-
sumed the placeof chief mourner
by the Commodore's chair.
With hands clasped before him,
head slightly bent, he watched,
and evidently listened.
It was interesting company.
But, taking into account the
size of the bedrooms and some
other matters, the Commodore
at breakfast asked for his bill.
Our waiter had begun a fresh
morning in sprightliest Turvey-
drop manner. He plumped
down to the infinite gloomiest
depths of Kemble.
"Excuse me asking," he murmured.
"I hope nothing has arisen with-n these
premises to inoculate this abrupt decision.
There has, I trust, been no incivility nor
any assault?"
Evidently assault' from some unknown
quarter was one of the ordinary conditions
of life at Mulligan's.
The Commodore assured him that we had
never been better treated in our lives.
Also, he tipped him on a scale that momen-
tarily took away his breath. But nothing
could rouse him from the pit of depression
into which he had fallen. As we drove
away I noticed that, with his quick appre-
ciation of a situation, he had, as it were,
gone into mourning. Ordinary people in
such cases use black-edged writing paper.
As Mr. Kemble-Turveydrop sadly waved
farewell with his hand I observed that it
was black-edged at the finger-nails.

IESSON5-OP

TJE was a dream of innocence, like other li£tle boys;
He played, between repose and meals, among his childish toys;
One was a glass wherein he watched the fleeting sands of Time,
And one a strange amorphous beast, some rabbit of the prime.
Judged by the average bulk to which the mass of infants run,
He looks precocious for a babe whose total age is one;
Perhaps the exigence of Art, which sees with larger eyes,
Is partially responsible for his abnormal size.
Behold him, then, his placid brain, beneath the curly hair.
At present unaffected by a solitary care;
Until the fateful hour arrives when he must undergo
A course of lectures on the truths an infant ought to know.
It is the dame Experience from whom he has to learn;
The epithets applied to her are " bitter," "rude," and " stern ";
But in the picture she's a dear, and wears a Greekish dress,
And seems in all respects a most attractive governess.
The room to which our little friend reluctantly was brought
Was rather like the lecture-hall where Princess Ida taught;
The furniture embraced a globe, an owl, an astrolabe,
And much that might have petrified an ordinary babe.
Two pair of damsels stood beneath the late Minerva's bust—
Science and Art and likely types of what is True and Just;
With mirror, scales, and microscope, and harp of ancient pitch,
And also private labels on to show you which was which.

I cannot say if they were there as Members of the Staff
"Who had to turn the audience out in case it chose to laugh;
Perhaps for privato motives they decided to assist
At the discourse of which I now propose to give the gist.
"Come, put your hands behind your back, and listen like a man"
(These, roughly, were the terms in which Experience began);
"While I proceed to talk of Life, its dangers, snares and shams,
As illustrated by a set of speaking diagrams."
At this she called attention to her repertoire of prints,
Driving the object-lesson home with exegetic hints;
But nothing fixed his mobile eye or caused his flesh to creep
Until he struck a work of art called Look before you leap I
The scene portrayed a careless frog that would a-swimming go
Without enquiring if the pond was occupied or no;
Already launched in middle air and impotent to stop,
He notes a duck about to take and eat'him on the hop.
The boy, however, overlooked (his judgment being crude)
The truth imbedded in the frog's insensate hardihood;
His mind, impervious to what the picture-tale implied,
Was wondering how the duck would "bear the awful strain inside.
"Learn from the frog's appalling fate," his gentle teacher said,
"How full is life of yawning pits, how well to glance ahead;
I do not say that ducks abound in everybody's bath,
But other perils, quite as great, are sure to strew your path.
"I've noticed older men than you repeatedly collapse
All through the fatal habit of ignoring booby-traps;
But you, if you should go to war and have the faintest doubt
As to the enemy's designs, don't hesitate to scout I"
So for an hour the lady sought to swell the infant's brain,
He being still intrigued about the duck's internal pain;
Till with a touch of cloud upon his former reckless joy,
He left the place, a sadder and no whit a wiser boy. O. S.

LEAVES FROM A FATHER'S
DIARY.
Mabel makes up her mind to go to town
for the day. Shopping, or something of
that sort. She says, "I 've told Nurse
to bring the child in to you at eleven
o'clock. You said you wanted her to get
escape. Am conscious of lack of dignity.
Binns produces chocolates from sideboard.
Give one to Allie. Effect magical. She
smiles all over. Consult Parent's Guide.
Find the following: "It is extremely
unwise to bribe very young children to
be 'good' with sweets. A child soon
ceases to believe in the justice of its
to know you better, so this will
opportunity." Delightful, of
course. 1 rather wanted to
finish article on "A Japanese
System of Ethics," but sup-
pose it must wait. Study The
Parent's Guide. Full of extra-
ordinarily useful information.
"A father," it says, "must
remember that he is neces-
sarily something of a stranger
in the nursery. But with
patience he will succeed in
gaining the affection and con-
fidence of his child. If the
child shows a certain amount
of shyness he must encourage
it to treat him as a friend, and
happy relations are sure in the
end to be established." Yes,
but how to proceed? There's
the rub.
Eleven o'clock. Nurse brings
little Alice into library: "Allie
going to stay with Daddie,"
she says, "Allie must be good
girl." Nurse departs. Howls
from little Allie. Try to coax
her. Repulsed. Consult
Parent's Guide. Allie lying on
floor and howling piteously.
Difficult to find anything ap-
plicable to present situation.
"Young girls should not bo
allowed to loll for hours in the
mother's easy-chair." That
won't help. "A sense of pro-
portion is lacking in children."
Too true. "Much harm may
come of excessive severity on
the part of parents. Gentle
methods should always be
tried, for it must be remem-
bered that children are easily
swayed by their affections."
Will try gentle methods.
"Come, Allie, bo good. See
Daddy's beautiful watch.
Oh, such lovely tick-ticks."
Repulsed with ignominy.
"Boo-hoo! want Nana." Pick her up
from floor and put her on my knee.
Child makes herself stiff as a ramrod
and slides off heavily. More howls.
Pick her up again. Same operation
repeated. Pick hor up and shake her.
She smacks — yes, smacks ! — my face.
Put her down. Meditate. Happy thought!
A chocolate. Take her into dining-room.
Butler in the room. Seems surprised,
and evidently pities me. Explain to him
apologetically reason for my entrance.
Allie howling and struggling violently to
be a good parents if it finds that by crying or mis-

FOR HUNTING THIS YEAR. ALL GONE OFF TO THE WAR."
Brer Brush. "And they do say that there isn't ANY money
TO KEEP UP THE HOUNDS."
Sly Reynard. "What's death to trbii— eh?"
Brer Brush. "Is sport to us. To our next merry meeting!"
behaving it can secure a bribe in the
form of a chocolate, or something simi-
lar." Wish I had read this before. Too
late now ; chocolate gone, save for a few
fragments plastered on cheeks and chin.
Take Allie back into library. She says,
interrogatively, "More choc?" Parent's
Guide says: "A father should never
deceive his child." I say, "No, no more
choc." Allie drops her lip: all outward
signs of another howling fit. Say hastily,
"Yes, yes; more choc, if Allie good girl."
"Allie good. Give choc," comes the
prompt reply. I give. Temporary peace.
Have placed Allie on floor. Will try to
converse with her:—"Does Allie love
Daddy?" I ask tentatively. Immediate
answer very decisively, "No, no!" Poser.
"Does Allie love Mamma?" "Yes—and
Nana." "But Allie must love Daddy."
"No, no!" Hopeless. Give it up. Will
try reading to her: "Allie fetch book for
Daddy to read." She fetches
supplement of Times from table.
Good little girl. Wonderful
how that child's intelligence is
advancing by leaps and bounds.
So different from all other
children I've ever met.
She's only two years old, and
when I tell her to fetch a
book she — well, she fetched
the supplement of the Times.
That's not a book, of course;
but it shows how the child
exercises her reasoning
powers. She says, "Daddy,
read." Bless her heart. Road
through all the births,
marriages and deaths.
"More, more!" says the
child. Read "In memoriam"
notices. One ends with
couplet: "Afflictions sore long
time he bore; He is not lost
but gone before." Allie de-
lighted. "More, more, gone
'fore," she shouts. Have to
read that couplet twelve
times. Try change by read-
ing money article. Received
with high disapproval. Read
couplet ten times more. At
last refuse to go on. Simply
can't bring myself to go on.
Child furious. Throws herself
on floor, having previously
seized cheque-book from table.
"Allie must give Daddy his
book." Silence. "Give Daddy
book." Silence. Try to seize
it. Foiled. Consult Parent's
Guide. Find luminous passage:
—"Violent coercion is usually
a mistake with very young
children. If a child does not
yield immediate obedience, a
parent should seek to divert
its attention to some other
matter. Afterwards it will be
found that the child, having
had its mind diverted from the idea of
resistance, will readily comply." Good!
will act upon suggestion. "See, Allie,
Daddy's beautiful match-box." Child
eyes mo suspiciously. "Daddy give
Allie match-box," I add. She takes it.
Retires to corner, clutching match-box
and cheque-book. "Now, Allie, give
Daddy book." Silence. She opens
cheque-book. Tears two cheques. This
is -too much. I seize cheque-book.
Howls. Enter Nurse, and removes child.
Thank heaven!

SOMETHING LIKE A CHRISTMAS BILL.
It '8 just come in, with the compliments
of Messrs. Tiddler, Tompkinson, Turtle,
and Trumms. (Solicitors' firms usually
run to many names; suspect arrangement
is made with intent to remember each in
the bill.) For some time have had case
before Privy Council. This little ac-
count is the bill of costs; amount of
money at issue under £20; but Principle
November.
allowed charge of 10*. for "attending
printer with revised proof, instructing
him to strike off seventy-five copies."
What a picture this way of putting it
presents to the awed mind! One of the
Firm, possibly the whole alphabet, pro-
ceed in state to "attend on the printer,"
a varlet carrying the revised proof. On
arrival, trumpet sounds, printer trem-
blingly approaches.
but look how it swells out in my bill of
costs. "Copy summons for counsel, 2*. 64.;
attending him therewith, 10s.; attending
marking counsel's brief to hear judgment,
10*.; paid his fee and clerk, £5 15s. 6d.,
attending paying fees, 10s."
Observe: here is one transaction, one
morning call at chambers over the way.
But the Firm cut up the ten minutes in-
volved with nice distinction. The junior

involved; not going to be ridden rough-
shod over by a wealthy gas company, even
if they thrive in Canada, where I have a
small property. Fought them in Colonial
Courts; lost. Brought case over to Privy
Council. Won appeal, and here's my bill
of costs: total £158 19*. 2d. But stay, a
word more.
Would have been £2 more only for
vigilance of Taxing Master. Having
passed charge of 10s. for "attending
printer and instructing him to strike off
proof," the many T's sat down quickly
and charged a guinea for "revising
proof."
Taxing Master knocked off half; but he
"Strike off," says the Firm in voice of
thunder — (the printer is sure it's his
head; quite relieved when the Firm con-
tinues)—" seventy-five copies."
What really happened was that the
office-boy was sent over with the proof.
All the same I pay 10s.
Through all the stages of their work
the Firm move with monotonously ordered
steps. But it is more than le premier pas
that costs. Each one is ticketed with
sums varying from 10s. upward. A sum-
mons to hear judgment being issued by
Privy Council, a copy of the document is
sent over by the junior clerk to the
counsel. That an ordinary procedure;
clerk engaged undergoes quick change in
fashion excelling Dan Leno or Arthur
Roberts. Having "attended" counsel
with copy of summons, he wipes the
perspiration from his brow and pockets
half a sovereign. Next, presents himself
as somebody else "attending marking
counsel's brief." Bang goes another ten
bob. Thirdly, he "pays counsel and
clerk's fees," and gravely credits himself
with a third 10s.
These only a few items from prodigious
bill. Same farce repeated for every
trivial action. Sounds like a joke, but it
isn't. Items are copied textually from my
little Christmas Bill.

THE WHISTFTJL MOOD.
(An Autumnal Episode.)
"It 'S a blessing to feel that the
summer is over and done with," re-
marked the King of Diamonds, with a
yawn. "I can't tell you how pleased
I was to hear the crackling of the
fire."
"Well, it's not for want of trying,"
said the Queen, snappishly. "You must
have an excellent imagination. I've been
trying to catch sight of the blaze through
the chink of the drawer all day."
"You're too impatient," purred the
Queen of Hearts. "Depend upon it, we
shall all of us see the fire to-night. You
heard one of the young ladies say that
grandpapa was talking about a game of
whist this evening, didn't you, dear?"
added the Queen of Hearts, looking to-
wards her husband.
"Distinctly," said the King, sleepily,
"and as we shall be wanted to-night, I
think I shall take forty winks now. The
first rubber is sure to exhaust us a good
deal."
*****
"Here's a pack of cards, mamma," said
Gladys.
"Oh, those are too dirty, child! We
must have a clean pack this winter."
"Gratitude!" growled several of the
Court cards. 1
"Throw them away!" called out papa
—and the pack went stiff with horror.
"Oh, papa," cried Gladys, "can't I
have them to play 'Draw the well dry'
with, and to make card-castles?"
"The degradation of it!" murmured
the Queens in chorus.
"Better death than disgrace," said the
Ace of Clubs, who was a Stoic philosopher.
"Wouldn't go so far as that," muttered
the Epicurean Ace of Hearts under his
breath.
"It may not be so bad after all," said
the Knave of Hearts generously. But he
was young and susceptible, and Gladys
was an undeniably pretty little girl. At
least, he thought so.

MORE ARMY REFORMS.
Our own military specialist sends us
information as to several projected
changes of an important character in the
Home Army.
With regard to the vexed question of
uniform, it is intended in future that the
area of pipeclay shall be considerably
increased. As the pay will be corre-
spondingly diminished, this will almost
certainly tend to encourage recruiting.
With regard to the head-gear of our
soldiers, it has been noticed with dismay
by the authorities that certain helmets
now in use afford their wearers some
slight protection from the sun. As this
is manifestly not the purpose of military
head-gear, which is primarily intended to
look " smart "—whatever that may mean
—a new helmet is being designed which
shall not have this objection. According
to present ideas the new helmet will be
worn (like a forage cap) over one ear, to
add to the comfort and dignity of the
British soldier.
It having come to the knowledge of
the War Office that some uniforms are
at present made almost loose enough to
eat and even walk in, this defect is to be
remedied at once. In future no private
or officer will be able to do anything
whatever in his uniform (dress or undress)
without splitting it.
Officers in His Majesty's Forces will be
reminded shortly in an Army Order that
hunting and polo,, and not the higher
tactics, are what should be assiduously
studied by the modern subaltern. The
Art of War, so-called, is a bookish affair
which may safely be left to spectacled
Germans.
An effort will at once be made to check
the regrettable tendency said to be mani-
fested in certain regiments to reduce the
expenses of the Officers' mess. As it is
felt that if this continues the Army will
cease to attract the younger sons of
aristocratic families, Commanding Officers
are requested to use their influence to
combat the movement without delay.

LAST, BUT NOT LEAST.'
TO CHRISTINE.
[An Offering from her Bachelor Uncle, who,
in default of the power to immortalize
her through the intrinsic merits of his
verse, consoles himself by enshrining
her in the deathless pages of Mr.
Punch's Almanack.]
Child of the silk-soft golden hair,
The sweet grave face, the hazel
eyes,
Mother of dolls, a constant care
That makes you prematurely wise;
(Although your brother, younger yet,
Adopts an independent tone,
And begs you will not always set
Your wisdom up against his own)—
I take delight to touch with you
On divers themes, and well I may;
It is your charming habit to
Believe exactly what I say.
When you enquire with thoughtful brow
What any given object is,
Why it was made, and when, and
how,
And other cognate mysteries;
When by your manner you imply
That nothing known to mortal men,
Or even angels up the sky,
Eludes my penetrating ken;
Forgotten hopes renew their bloom;
I feel I have not wholly failed;
"There still is one," I say, " from whom
My awful ignorance is veiled.
"As yet no disillusion saps
A faith pathetically stout;
And several seasons must elapse
Before she gets to find me out."
So from our converse I abstract
A sentiment akin to joy,
Fleeting, I own, and, as a fact,
Not unencumbered with alloy.
For memory probes an ancient sore
Connected with my distant youth;
I, too, should like to be once more
A quiet searcher after truth;
Once more to learn in various schools
The things rejected by-and-by
When I discovered certain rules
Which the exceptions stultify;
Found Nature with herself at strife
(To take a single case) and woke
To the depressing view that life
Must be regarded as a joke.
A blight possessed my eager soul;
My fancies took a fatal twist;
And I assumed the chronic role
Of what is called a humorist.
For you such fears are far away;
Your faith and your digestion thrive;
But then I'm forty, if a day,
And you, of course, are only five.
Still, here's the best I can in rhyme;
And when (how rare the angels' calls !)
You come again at Christmas-time
To greet the dear familiar walls,
You '11 take my verse for what it's worth.
And, though you find it barely sane,
You '11 raise a decent show of mirth
To spare the author needless pain;
And lift your tiny silver mug,
Graven with mine, the giver's, name,
And toast my health, and bid mo hug
The patient hope of coming fame;
And I shall answer, "Dear, you see,
My future lies behind my back;
But here's your immortality
In Mr. Punch's Almanack!" O. S.

"MY LADY NICOTINE."—"Pettigrew will
be welcomed if he comes, but he is a married man,
and we seldom see him nowadays. Others will
be regarded a8 intruders. If they are smoking
common tobaccos, they must either be allowed to
try ours or be requested to withdraw. One need
only put his head in at my door to realise that
tobaccos are of two kinds, the Arcadia and others.
No one who smokes the Arcadia would ever
attempt to describe its delights, for his pipe
would be certain to go out. When he was at
school, Jimmy Moggridge smoked a cane-chair,
and he has since said that from cane to ordinary
mixtures was not so noticeable as the change
from ordinary mixtures to the Arcadia. I ask no
one to believe this, for the confirmed smoker in
Arcadia detests arguing with anybody about any-
thing. Were I anxious to prove Jimmy's state-
ment I would merely give you the only address at
which the Arcadia is to be had. But this I will
not do. It would be as rash as proposing a man
with whom I am unacquainted for my Club.

THE SECRET OF SUCCESS—STERLING HONESTY OF PURPOSE.
WITHOUT IT LIFE IB A SHAM!
"A new invention is brought before the public and commands success. A score of abominable imitation* are immediately introduced by
the unscrupulous, who. in copying the original closely enough to deceive the public, and yet not so exactly as to infringe upon legal rights, exercise
an ingenuity that, employed in an original channel, could not fail to secure reputation and profit."—Adams.
EYERY HOUSEHOLD AND TRAVELLING TRDNK ODGHT TO CONTAIN A BOTTLE Of
ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT'
A Simple Remedy for PREVENTING and CURING by NATURAL MEANS
All Functional Derangements of the Liver, Temporary Congestion
arising from Alcoholic Beverages, Errors in Diet, Biliousness, Gout
or Rheumatic Poison, Sick Headache, Giddiness, Vomiting, Heart-
burn, Sourness of the Stomach, Constipation, Thirst, Skin Erup-
tions, Boils, Feverish Cold with High Temperature and Quick
Pulse, Influenza, Throat Affections, and Fevers of all kinds.
It is not too much to say that the merits of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' itave been publisJied,
tested, and approved, literally from Pole to Pole, and that its cosmopolitan popularity to-day
presents one of tJie most signal illustrations of commercial enterprise to be found in our trading
records.
Indigestion, Biliousness, Sickness, &c.—" I have often thought of writing to tell you what ' Fruit Salt' has done for me. I
used to be a perfect martyr to Indigestion and Biliousness. About six or seven years back my husband suggested 1 should try ' Fruit Salt.' I did
so, and the result has been marvellous. I never have the terrible pains and sickness I used to have; I can eat almost anything now. I always keep it
in the house, and recommend it to my friends, as it is such an invaluable pick-me-up if you have a headache, or don't feel just right.
"Yours truly, . Aug. 8th, 1900."
The effect of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' upon any DISORDERED, EXCITED, SLEEPLESS, or FEVERISH
CONDITION (or as a Pick-me-up), is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE'S OWN REMEDY, and
an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION.—Examine the Dottle and Capsule, and see that they are marked ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT.' Otherwise you have a WORTH LESS IMITATION.

SOAP
"Matchless for the Complexion."
Fop more than 100 years PEARS' SOAP has maintained Its supremacy in the face of the whole world's
competition. Such a record coutd not be achieved without cause. Temporary successes are comparatively easy, but for an article to
maintain its popularity generation after generation it must appeal to something more than passing fancy. This is the case with Pears'Soap.
It is, and always has been, an honest product. Everywhere abroad it has found a place in public favour equal to that for so long held in
England. Men and women alike find it good and reliable. The man who has once tried Pears' Soap in the form of a Shaving Stick wants
no other; he takes it with him on alt his Journeys. The woman who travels and fails to take a supply of Pears' must put up with
substitutes until her burning, smarting, skin Inexorably demands the "matchless for the complexion."

The purest and best Smoking: Mixture ever produced.
The price of the fluent tobacco leaf imported does not warrant the high prices charged for many
Mixtures on the Market. Only the finest leaf is used in the Manufacture of Tortoise-shell Mixture,
which is sold at 5d. per ounce, or 6s. &<L per lb., and at tliat price leaves the retailer a fair profit. Smokers
who pay more than 5d. p?r ounce for pipe tobacco do not get value for the extra monev, but simply
transfer their cold cash into someone elBe's pocket. THE BLENDING IS PERFECTION.

common tobaccos, they must either be allowed to
try ours or be requested to withdraw. One need
only put his head in at my door to realise that
tobaccos are of two kinds, the Arcndia and others.
No one who smokes the Arcadia would ever
attempt to describe its delights, for his pipe
would be certain to go out. "When he was at
Mimol, Jimmy Moggndge smoked a cane-chair,
and he has since said that from cane to ordinary
mixtures was not so noticeable as the change
from ordinary mixtures to the Arcadia. I ask no
one to believe this, for the confirmed smoker in
Arcadia detests arguing with anybody about any-
thing. Were I anxious to prove .Jimmy's state-
ment I would merely give you the only address at
which the Arcadia is to be had. But this I will
not do. It would be as rash as proposing a man

PUNCH, UR THE LONDON CHAltlVARL—July 17, 1901.
THE SECRET OF SUCCESS—STERLING HONESTY OF PURPOSE.
WITHOUT IT LIFE IS A SHAM!
"A new invention is brought before the public and commands success. A score of abominable imitations are immediately introduced by
the unscrupulous, who, in copying the original closely enough to deceive the public, and yet not so exactly as to infringe upon legal rights, exercise
an ingenuity that, employed in an original channel, could not fail to secure reputation and profit."—Adams.
EYERY HOUSEHOLD AND TRAVELLING TRUNK OUGHT TO CONTAIN A BOTTLE OF
ENO'S 6 FRUIT SALT
A Simple Remedy for PREVENTING and CURING by NATURAL MEANS
All Functional Derangements of the Liver, Temporary Congestion
arising from Alcoholic Beverages, Errors in Diet, Biliousness, Gout
or Rheumatic Poison, Sick Headache, Giddiness, Vomiting, Heart-
burn, Sourness of the Stomach, Constipation, Thirst, Skin Erup-
tions, Boils, Feverish Cold with High Temperature and Quick
Pulse, Influenza, Throat Affections, and Fevers of all kinds.
It is not too much to say that the merits of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' Itave been publisfted,
tested, and approved, literally from Pole to Pole, and that its cosmopolitan popularity to-day
presents one of tlie most signal illustrations of commercial enterprise to be found in our trading
records.
- Indigestion, Biliousness, Sickness, &c.—"I have of ten thought of writing to tell you what' Fruit Salt' has done for me. I
used to be a perfect martyr to Indigestion and Biliousness. About six or seven years back my husband suggested I should try ' Fruit Salt.' I did
bo, and the result has been marvellous. I never have the terrible pains and sickness I used to have; I can cat almost anything now. I always keep it
in the house, and recommend it to my friends, as it is such an invaluable pick-me-up if you have a headache, or don't feel just right.
"Yours truly, . Aug. 8t/<, 1900."
The effect of ENO'S • FRUIT SALT' upon any DISORDERED, EXCITED, SLEEPLESS, op FEVERISH
CONDITION (or as a Pick-me-up), is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE'S OWN REMEDY, and
an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION.—Examine the Bottle and Capsule, and see that then are marked ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT.' Otherwise you have a WORTHLESS IMITATION.

which is sold at bd. per ounce, or 6*. 8/i. per lb., and at that price leaves the retailer a fair profit. Smokers l'

SOAP ASSISTED BY CUTICURA OINTMENT.
For preserving, purifying1, and beautifying the skin, for cleansing the scalp of

ing, and soothing red, rough, and sore hands, in the form of baths for annoying
irritations and inflammations incidental to golf, riding, and athletics, or too free
or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes for ulcerative weaknesses, and
many sanative, antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves, as well as
for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nurserv.
No amount of persuasion can induce those who have once used these great
skin purifiers and beautifiers to use any others. CUTICURA SOAP combines
delicate emollient properties derived from CUTICURA, the great skin cure, with
the purest of cleansing ingredients, and the most refreshing of flower odours. No
other medicated soup is to be compared with it for preserving, purifying, and beau-
tifying the skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No other foreiirn or domestic to'let soap,
however exp«nsi,e, is to be compared with it for all the purposes of the toilet,
bath, and nursery. Thus it combines in ONF SOAP at ONE PRICE, the BEST
skin and complexion soap, and the BEST toilet and baby soap in the world.

THE SECRET OF SUCCESS—STERLING HONESTY OF PURPOSE.
WITHOUT IT LIFE IS
BHAM!
"A new invention is brought before the public and commands success. A score of abominable imitations are immediately introduced by
the unscrupulous, who, in copying the original closely enough to deceive the public, and yet not so exactly as to infringe upon legal lights, exercise
an ingenuity that, employed in an original channel, could not fail to secure reputation and profit."—Adams'.
EYERY HOUSEHOLD AND TRAVELLING TROM OUGHT TO CONTAIN A BOTTLE OF
ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT'
A Simple Remedy for PREVENTING and CURING by NATURAL MEANS
All Functional Derangements of the Liver, Temporary Congestion
arising from Alcoholic Beverages, Errors in Diet, Biliousness, Gout
or Rheumatic Poison, Sick Headache, Giddiness, Vomiting, Heart-
burn, Sourness of the Stomach, Constipation, Thirst, Skin Erup-
tions, Boils, Feverish Cold with High Temperature and Quick
Pulse, Influenza, Throat Affections, and Fevers of all kinds.
It is not too much to say that the merits of EXO'S 'FRUIT SALT' itave been published,
tested, and approved, literally from Pole to Pole, and that its cosmopolitan ;opularity to-day
presents one of tlu most signal illustrations of commercial enterprise to be found in our trading
records.
Indigestion, Biliousness, Sickness, &c—" I have often thought of writing to tell you what ' Fruit Salt' has done for me. I
used to be a perfect martyr to Indigestion and Biliousness. About six or seven years back my husband suggested I should try • Fruit Salt.' 1 did
60, and the result has been marvellous. I never have the terrible pains and sickness I used to have; I can cat almost anything now. I always keep it
in the house, and recommend it to my friends, as it is such an invaluable pick-me-up if you have a headache, or don't feel just right.
"Yours truly, . Aug. 8th, 1900."
The effect of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' upon any DISORDERED, EXCITED, SLEEPLESS, or FEVERISH

sending their nether garments to be pressed, as the process is simplicity itself, and trousers can be stretched and
pressed overnight and ready for wear the following morning. The reason probably of the great success of the

he welcomed if he comes, but he is a married man,
and we seldom see him nowadays. Others will
be regarded as intruders. If they are smoking
common tobaccos, they must either be allowed to
tiy ours or be requested to withdraw. One need
only put his head in at my door to realise that
tobaccos are of two kinds, the Arcadia and others.
No one who smokes the Arcadia would ever
attempt to describe its delight*, for his pipe
would be certain to go out. When he was at
school, Jimmy Moggridge smoked a cane-chair,
and he has since said that from cane to ordinary
mixtures was not so noticeable as the change
from ordinary mixtures to the Arcadia. I ask no
one to believe this, for the confirmed smoker in
Arcadia detests arguing with anybody about any-
thing. Were I anxious to prove Jimmy's state-
ment I would merely give you the only address at
which the Arcadia is to be had. But this I will
not do. It would be as rash as proposing a man
with whom I am unacquainted for my Club.
You may not be worthy to smoke the Arcadia Mixture."

"ICV LADY NICOTINE."—"Pettigrew will
be welcomed if he come*, but he a married man.
and we seldom see him nowadays. Others will
be regarded as intruders. If they are smoking
common tobaccos, they must either be allowed t"
try ours or be requested to withdraw. One need
only put his head in at my door to realise that
tobaccos are of two kinds, the Arcadia and others.
No one who smokes the Arcadia would ever
attempt to describe its delights, for his pipe
would be certain to go out. When he was at
r-chool, Jimmy Moggridge smoked a cane-chair,
and he has since said that from cane to ordinary
mixtures was not so noticeable as the change
from ordinary mixtures to the Arcadia. I ask no
one to believe this, for the confirmed smoker in
Arcadia detests arguing with anybody about any-
thing. Were I anxious to prove Jimmy's state-
ment I would merely give you the only address at
which the Arcadia is to be had. But this I will
not do. It would be as rash as proposing a man
with whom I am unacquainted for my Club.
You may not be worthv to smoke the Arcadia Mixture."
Dr. J. M. BARRIE says: "What I call the 'ARCADIA' in 'My Lrd/
Nicotine' is the * CRAVEN' Mixture, and no other."

THE SECRET OF SUCCESS-STERLING HONESTY OF PURPOSE.
WITHOUT XT LIFE IB JL BHAM!
"A do.w invention is brought before the public and commands success. A score of aboviinable imitationt are immediately introduced by
the unscrupulous, who, in copying the original closely enough to deceive the public, and yet not so exactly as to infringe upon legal rights, exercise
an ingenuity that, employed in an original channel, could not fail to secure reputation and profit."—Adam*.
EYERY HOUSEHOLD AND TRAVELLING TRUNK OUGHT TO CONTAIN A BOTTLE OF
ENO'S c FRUIT SALT'
A Simple Remedy for PREVENTING and CURING by NATURAL MEANS
All Functional Derangements of the Liver, Temporary Congestion
arising from Alcoholic Beverages, Errors in Diet, Biliousness, Gout
or Rheumatic Poison, Sick Headache, Giddiness, Vomiting, Heart-
burn, Sourness of the Stomach, Constipation, Thirst, Skin Erup-
tions, Boils, Feverish Cold with High Temperature and Quick
Pulse, Influenza, Throat Affections, and Fevers of all kinds.
It is not too much to say that the merits of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' liave been published,
tested, and approved, literally from Pole to Pole, and that its cosmopolitan popularity to-day
presents one of tlie most signal illustrations of commercial enterprise to be found in our trading
records.
Indigestion, Biliousness, Slokness, dec—" 1 have often thought of writing to tell you what ' Fruit Salt * has done for me. I
used to be a perfect martyr to Indigestion and Biliousness. About six or seven years back my husband suggested 1 should try « Fruit Salt.' I did
so, a»d the result has been marvellous. I never have the terrible pains and sickness 1 used to have; 1 can eat almost anything now. I always keep it
in the house, and recommend it to my friends, as it is such an invaluable pick-me-up if you have a headache, or don't feel just right.
"Yours truly, . Aug. Sth, 1900."
The effect of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' upon any DISORDERED, EXCITED, SLEEPLESS, or FEVERISH
CONDITION (of as' a Pick-me-up), is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in faot, NATURE'S OWN REMEDY, and
an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION.—Examine the BoUle and Captvlt, and tec thai they are marked ENO'S 'FRTJ1T SALT: Otherwise you have a WORTHLESS IMITATION.

THE SECRET OF SUCCESS-STERLING HONESTY OF PURPOSE.
WITHOUT IT LIFE 18 A SHAM!
"A new invention is brought before the public and commands success. A score of abominable imitathii* are Immediately introduced by
the unscrupulous, who, in copying the original closely enough to deceive the public, and yet not so exactly as to infringe upon legal rights, exercise
an ino-enuitv that, employed in an original channel, could not fail to secure reputation and profit."—Adams.
EYERY HOUSEHOLD AND TRAVELLING TRUNK ODGHT TO CONTAIN A BOTTLE OF
ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT
A Simple Remedy for PREVENTING and CURING by NATURAL MEANS
All Functional Derangements of the Liver, Temporary Congestion
arising from Alcoholic Beverages, Errors in Diet, Biliousness, Gout
or Rheumatic Poison, Sick Headache, Giddiness, Vomiting, Heart-
burn, Sourness of the Stomach, Constipation, Thirst, Skin Erup-
tions, Boils, Feverish Cold with High Temperature and Quick
Pulse, Influenza, Throat Affections, and Fevers of all kinds.
It is not too much to say that the merits of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' have been published,
tested, and approved, literally from Pole to Pole, and that its cosmopolitan popularity to-day
presents one of tlie most signal illustrations of commercial enterprise to be found in our trading
records.
Indigestion, Biliousness, Sickness, &c—" I have often thought of writing to tell you what' Fruit Salt * has done for me. I
used to be a perfect martyr to Indigestion and Biliousness. About six or seven years back my husband suggested I should try * Fruit Salt.' 1 did
so, and the result has been marvellous. I never have the terrible pains and sickness I used to have; I can eat almost anything now. I always keep it
in the house, and recommend it to my friends, as it is such an invaluable pick-me-up if you have a headache, or don't feel "just right.
•'Yours truly, . Aug. Sth, 1900."
The effect of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' upon any DISORDERED, EXCITED, SLEEPLESS, or FEVERISH
CONDITION (or aa a Piok-me-up), is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE'S OWN REMEDY, and
an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION.—Examine the Bottle ami Capsule, and ere that lltetj are marked ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT.' OtherwUe yimluive a WORTHLESS IMITATION.

"MY LADY NICOTINE."—"Pettigrew will
be welcomed if he comes, but he is a married man,
and we seldom see him nowadays. Others will
be regarded as intruders. If they are smoking
common tobaccos, they must either be allowed to
try ours or be requested to withdraw. One need
only put his head in at my door to realise that
tobaccos are of two kinds, the Arcadia and others.
No one who smokes the Arcadia would ever
attempt to describe its delights, for his pipe
would be certain to go out. When he was at
school, Jimmy Moggridge smoked a cane-chair,
and he lias since said that from cane to ordinary
mixtures was not so noticeable as the change
from ordinary mixtures to the Arcadia. I ask no
one to believe this, for the confirmed smoker in
Arcadia detests arguing with anybody about any-
thing. Were I anxious to prove Jimmy's state-
ment I would merely give you the only address at
which the Arcadia is to be had. But this I will
not do. It would be as rash as proposing a man
with whom I am unacquainted for my Club,
worthy to smoke the Arcadia Mixture."

BRONCHITIS
There is positively nothing equal to Angler's
Kmulsion for the relief and cure of Troublesome
Coughs, Bronchitis, and all Chronic 1-ung
Affections. Made wi.h our specially purified
petroleum it has a wonderfully soothing and
healing effect upon the raucous membrane of
the throat, lungs, and air passages. Moreover,
it is pleasant to take and agrees with anil
benefits the most delicate stomach, promoting a
healthy appetite, aiding digestion and assimila-
tion, and building up health and strength. It
is equally good for the cough of Chronic Bron-
chitis with profuse expectoration; the dry,
harsh throat cough; the irritating cough of
Influenza; and for Whooping Cough and Croupy
Coughs of Children. Thousands of doctors
prescribe it, and every sufferer who has used
it recommends it.

THE SECRET OF SUCCESS—STERLING HONESTY OF PURPOSE.
WITHOUT IT LIFE IS A SHAM!
"A new invention is brought before the public anil commands success. A score of abominable imitations are immediately introduced by
the unscrupulous, who, in copying the original closely enough to deceive the public, and yet not so exactly as to infringe upon legal rights, exercise
an ingenuity that, employed in an original channel, could not fail to secure reputation and profit."—Adam*.
EVERY HOUSEHOLD AND TRAVELLING TRUNK OUGHT TO CONTAIN A BOTTLE OF
ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT'
A Simple Remedy for PREVENTING and CURING by NATURAL MEANS
All Functional Derangements of the Liver, Temporary Congestion
arising from Alcoholic Beverages, Errors in Diet, Biliousness, Gout
or Rheumatic Poison, Sick Headache, Giddiness, Vomiting, Heart-
burn, Sourness of the Stomach, Constipation, Thirst, Skin Erup-
tions, Boils, Feverish Cold with High Temperature and Quick
Pulse, Influenza, Throat Affections, and Fevers of all kinds.
It is not too much to say that the merits of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' have been publislied,
tested, and approved, literally from Pole to Pole, and that its cosmopolitan popularity to-day
presents one of the most signal illustrations of commercial enterprise to be found in our trading
records.
Indigestion, Biliousness, Sickness, &c.—" I have often thought of writing to tell you what1 Fruit Salt' has done for me. I
used to be a perfect martyr to Indigestion and Biliousness. About six or seven years back my husband suggested I should try * Fruit Salt.' I did
so, and the result has been marvellous. I never have the terrible pains and sickness I used to have; I can eat almost anything now. I always keep it
in the house, and recommend it to my friends, as it is such an invaluable pick-me-up if you have a headache, or don't feel just right.
"Yours truly, . Aug. 8<7t, 1900."
The effect of ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT' upon any DISORDERED, EXCITED, SLEEPLESS, or FEVERISH
CONDITION (or as a Pick-hie-up), is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE'S OWN REMEDY, and
an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION.—Examine the Bottle and Capsule, and tte that they are marked ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT.' Otherwise yov, have a WORTHLESS IMITATION.

One great advantage of Premier Vinolia Soap is
that it agrees with the skin in wintry weather,
«
after the cuticle has been cut and made sensitive
by cold winds and life indoors, just as well as it
agrees with the complexion in the summer, when
the air is refreshing and balmy, and one spends
most of the time out of doors. Vinolia Soap is
perfumed with safe scents.

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1902.
• We shut our eyes, the flowers bloom on;
We murmur, but the corn-ears All!
We choose the shadow, but the sun
That casts it shines behind us stilL'
And each good thought or action moves the dark world nearer to the SUH.—WlUTTlEK.
THE BEST OF US IS JUST A SENTRY AT HIS POST.-Sir John Luckock, F.R.&
LIGHT WHEN THOU ELSE WERT BLIND I
STRENGTH WHEN LIFE'S SURGES RUDEST ROLL.
There are three Lessons I would write,
Three words as with a burning pen,
In tracing's of eternal light,
Upon the hearts of men.
HAVE HOPE. Though clouds environ now,
And Gladness hides her face in scorn,
Tut thou the shadow from thy brow—
NO Night but hath its Morn.
HAVE FAITH. Where'er thy bark is
driven—
The Calm's disport, the Tempest's mirth —
Know this: God rules the Host of Heaven.
HAVE LOVE. Not Love alone for one.
But man as man thy brother call,
And scatter, like the circling Sun,
Thy Charities on all/
Thus grave these lessons on thy soul -
Kaith, Hope, and Ix>ve— and thou shalt find
Strength when life's surges rudest roll,
Light when thou else wert blind.—Schim.er.
A GREAT HEART AND A LITTLE HOUSE!
'HAPPY IS THE MAN WHO SOWS THE GOOD AND TRUE:
THE HARVEST WILL NOT FAIL HIM!'
Absolute veracity is more needed now than at any former period of
our history. That of which our
age stands most in need is a man
able to gratify every just desire,
and yet to i* contented with a
little. 'A great heart in a
little house,' says Lacordaire,
'is of all things here l>elow that
which has ever touched me most.
Happy is the man who
sows the good and true:
the harvest will not faiL
him!'
Here is a fine specimen of
Honesty and Truthfulness. Ber-
nardin de Saint-Pierre has told the
story in his " Etudes de la Nature."
He was serving as an engineer
under the Count de Saint-Germain
during his campaign in Hesse, in
1760 For the first time he became
familiar with the horrors of
war. Day by day he passed through
sacked villages and devastated fields
and farmyards. Men, women, and
children were flying from their cot-
tages in tears. Armed men were
everywhere destroying the fruits of
their labour, regarding it as part of
their glory. But in the midst of

2"Ijc Christinas Carol.
'THE DRYING UP A SINGLE TEAR HAS MORE OF HONEST FAME THAN SHEDDING
SEAS Or GORE.'- I;.
A captain of dragoons was ordered out with his troop to forage for pro-
visions. They reached a poor Cabin, and knocked at the door. An old
man with a white beard appeared. "Take me to a field," said the officer,
"where 1 can obtain forage for
my troops." "Immediately, Sir,"
replied the old man. He put him-
self at their head, and ascended the
valley. After half-an-hour's march
a fine field of barley appeared.
"This will do admirably," said the
officer. "No," said the old man;
"wait a little, and all will be
right." They went on again until
they reached another barley-field.
The troops dismounted, mowed
down the grain, and, trussing it up
in bundles, put them on their horses.
"Friend," said the officer, "how
is it that you have brought US
SO far? The first field of barley
that we saw was quite as good as
this." "That is quite true,"
said the peasant, "but it Was
not mine."—Smiles.
THE MORAL:
It .:ikes ONE talent to make
money, TWO to keep it, but HOW
MANY to USE IT as that poor
peasant did in his hour of great
trial? SUCH a CHARACTER
should command the ADMIRA-
so many acts of cruelty, Saint-Pierre was consoled by a sublime trait
of character displayed by a poor man, whose cottage and farm lay in the
way of the advancing army.
TION of the WORLD for Honesty of Purpose, because HONESTY of
PURPOSE is above the WORLD.
* And such is Human Life; so gliding cn, It glimmers like a meteor, and is gone!'
THE JEOPARDY OF LIFE IS IMMENSELY INCREASED WITHOUT SUCH A SIMPLE PRECAUTION AS
ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT'
It is not too muck to say that the merits of EN OS 'FRUIT SALT' have been publislied, tested, and approved, literally
from Pole to Pole, and that its cosmopolitan popularity to-day presents one of tlte most signal illustrations of commercial
enterprise to be found in our trading records.
Indigestion, Biliousness, Sickness, &c— "I have often thought of writing to tell you what 'Fruit Salt' has done for me. I used
to be a perfect martyr to Indigestion and Biliousness. About six or seven years back my husband suggested I should try 1 Fruit Sa.lt.' I did so,
and the result has been marvellous. I never have the terrible pains and sickness I used to have; I can eat almost anything now. I always keep it in the
house, and recommend it to my friends, as it is such an invaluable pick-me-up if you have a headache, or don't feel just right.
"Yours truly, . Aug. %th, 1900."
The effect of ENO'S FRUIT SALT' upon any DISORDERED, SLEEPLESS, or FEVERISH CONDITION is
SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE'S OWN REMEDY, and an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION—Examine the Bottli andCapsule, andsee that they are marked ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT. Otherwise you have a WORTHLESS IMITATION.
