TO RUFUS, A SPANIEL.
Rufus, a bright New Year! A savoury stew,
Bones, broth and biscuits, is prepared for you.
See how it steams in your enamelled dish,
Mixed in each part according to your wish.
Hide in your straw the bones you cannot crunch-
They 'll come in handy for to-morrow's lunch;
Abstract with care each tasty scrap of meat,
Remove each biscuit to a fresh retreat
(A dog, I judge, would deem himself disgraced
Who ate a biscuit where he found it placed);
Then nuzzle round and make your final sweep,
And sleep, replete, your after-dinner sleep.
High in our ball we've piled the fire with logs
For you, the doyen of our corps of dogs.
There, when the stroll that health demands is done,
Your right to ease by due exertion won,
There shall you come, and on your long-haired mat,
Thrice turning round, shall tread the jungle flat,
And, rhythmically snoring, dream away
The peaceful evening of your New Year's day.
I think old Charon, punting through the dark,
Will hear a sudden friendly little bark ;
And on the shore he'll mark without a frown
A flap-eared doggie, bandy-legged and brown.
He 'll take you in : since watermen are kind,
He'd scorn to leave my little dog behind.
He'll ask no obol, but instal you there
On Styx's further bank without a fare.
There shall you sniff his cargoes as they come,
And droop your head, and turn, and still be dumb--
Till one fine day, half joyful, half in fear,
You run and prick a recognising ear,
And last, oh, rapture ! leaping to his hand,
Salute your master as he steps to land. R. C. L.
Rufus! there are who hesitate to own
Merits, they say, your master sees alone.
They judge you stupid, for you show no bent
To any poodle-dog accomplishment.
Your stubborn nature never stooped to learn
Tricks by which mumming dogs their biscuits earn.
Men mostly find you, if they change their seat,
Couchant obnoxious to their blundering feet;
Then, when a door is closed, you steadily
Misjudge the side on which you ought to be ;
Yelping outside when all your friends are in,
You raise the echoes with your ceaseless din,
Or, always wrong, but turn and turn about,
Howling inside when all the world is out.
They scorn your gestures and interpret ill
Your humble signs of friendship and good will;
Laugh at your gambols, and pursue with jeers
The ringlets clustered on your spreading ears ;
See without sympathy your sore distress
When Ray obtains the coveted caress,
And you, a jealous lump of growl and glare,
Hide from the world your head beneath a chair.
They say your legs are bandy-so they are :
Nature so formed them that they might go far,
They cannot brook your music; they assail
The joyful quiverings of your stumpy tail-
In short, in one anathema confound
Shape, mind and heart and all, my little hound.
Well, let them rail. If, since your life began,
Beyond the customary lot of man
Staunchness was yours; if of your faithful heart
Malice and scorn could never claim a part;
If in your master, loving while you live,
You own no fault or own it to forgive;
If, as you lay your head upon his knee,
Your deep-drawn sighs proclaim your sympathy ;
If faith and friendship, growing with your age,
Speak through your eyes and all his love engage;
If by that master's wish your life you rule
If this be folly, Rufus, you ’re a fool.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Is there such a word as Caterwaining? My Baronite
thinks not, the nearest approach being Caterwauling, which
is quite another story. “To caterwain” is to draw cats
with the skill, the humour and the variety possible to the
pencil of Mr. Louis WAN. The Annual (ANTHONY TRE-
HERNE & Co.) bearing his name is just now on the bookstalls,
and will be promptly taken off by all lovers of cats- of
course observing the preliminary of handing over a shilling.
Mr. WAIN has the rare gift, lavishly used, of investing the
harmless, necessary cat with humorous expression, often with
startling effect. Among contributors to the abundant and
excellent letterpress are Lady BANCROFT, Mr. JUSTIN MAC-
CARTHY, Mr. T. P. O'CONNOR and Mr. MacWHIRTER, who gives
a modest account of his travels.
Joe Wilson and His Mates (BLACKWOOD) opens a new
world to the observation of the tired story-reader. Mr.
HENRY LAWSON not only knows intimately the life of the
Australian bushman, but is able to convey vivid impressions
of it to others. My Baronite gathers that it is, in the main,
a sordid, slaving life, relieved on the part of the men by an
occasional bout of hard drinking. For the women there is
no surcease of work or deliverance from their squalid
surroundings. There is profound tragedy in the life of
Mrs. Spicer, whose scarecrow family are sole neighbours, at
Lahery's Creek, of Joe Wilson, his young wife, and infant
child. The book is written in the minor key, but it is
varied by many touches of genuine humour and pathos.
Richard Halpin (SMITH, ELDER) is a rattling good story of
the sea. Mr. MORGAN ROBERTSON has achieved the triumph
of making ironclads and torpedo boats as interesting as
MARRYAT and CLARK RUSSELL have been accustomed to paint
life on board the old sailing ship. Among many moving
scenes is that of the fight at Santiago, when, in the late
war, the Spanish Fleet attempted to break through the guard
of the United States Navy. Mr. ROBERTSON is not quite so
complete a master of female craft as he is of ironclads. But
all good sea stories must have their black- (or blue-) eyed
Susan, and the two American girls, Mabel and Bessie, are
good enough in their way. Mr. ROBERTSON writes with
knowledge, but my Baronite cannot believe there is founda-
tion for the terrible story he tells of life on board what
is accurately described as “the Hell ship,” bound for
Shanghai, with its impressed crew. America is a go-ahead
nation. But surely in the present times- and Richard
Halpin is right up to date it is not possible for an officer
and a seaman of the American Navy to be drugged and
carried off to slavery on board a merchant vessel.
For those who never waste a minute of their valuable
time, who read while they run, and love to have a pocket
companion of real worth always at hand, permit the Baron
to recommend the Oxford Miniature edition of the early
poems of ALFRED, Lord TENNYSON (London : HENRY FROWDE).
Old dog, content you ; Rufus, have no fear:
While life is yours and mine your place is here.
And when the day shall come, as come it must,
When Rufus goes to mingle with the dust
(If Fate ordains that you shall pass before
To the abhorred and sunless Stygian shore),

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Courage, my friend, we yet shall prove the war
Not such a bad investment after all,
Being rightly viewed. And 'tis no common joy
To have the hope that nerves our country's breast
So closely fused with what inflates our own
That, as with me i' th' case of Kaffir shares,
A man may be pro-Bull with twin intent. 0. S.
THE IDEOCRAT AT THE DINNER-TABLE.
V.-ON THE NEW YEAR's MARKET BOOM.
THANK you. The same to you, and many of them,
And each a shade more rosy than the last,
As this, the latest comer, well may be.
Indeed, the pregnant symptoms are to note
Of change to somewhat healthier, though the war
Drags out its lingering length, with here and there
Some incident provocative of regrets
For whoso fails to read the reckless hopes
Of desperate men, last flare o' th' flame that dies.
A well-plucked residue, I grant you that,
And slim enough at cover and countermove,
But in the higher sphere of business craft
Light-brained as conies ; never seem to know
Just when to cut their losses on the slump,
But stand to lose their all with holding on.
Where, pray, should we be now, we millionaires,
Had we not used betimes the native tact
That bids evacuate a rotting hulk ?
Yet, 'tis a type not wholly unredeemed
By shrewd exceptions worthy our regard.
Take KRUGER, now-a very different paste !
Why, there's a veteran knows his ropes too well
To fling away good shekels after bad ;
Laid fist on what of cash was left at call
Out of the common ruin his hand had wrought,
Placed it at solid interest overseas,
Himself its escort, and survives at large
Couching on furniture of Louis Quinze
There in his villa styled Oranjelust,
Close under Utrecht where the tulips sprout.
That's what I call recuperative power
After my own heart, who have nose enough
To scent distinction even in a foe,
Whence who has wit will not despise to learn.
But to resume our talk of happier times
Presaged by tokens not to be mistook.
How traced, you ask? I'th' casualty lists?
My friend, I go by subtler signs than these;
I have my finger on the nation's pulse,
Counting the heart-beats which betray its health.
In plainer terms, I study day by day
The Market's movements; scan my bulletin
Of change i’ th' current rate of blood through veins,
And so discern its vitals how they fare.
And when I feel, as now, the quickened life
Beat louder at her core (the Stock Exchange),
Why then I know my England's heart is right,
And I may dine more freely-dine, I mean,
Not on a nobler scale, which scarce could be,
But with a sense of savour undisturbed,
That draws a rarer rapture from the bisque,
That knows a subtler nuance in the snipe.
So you and I, we look to touch at last
What meed we merit who have sacrificed
If not our actual persons, yet at least
Much ease of heart. Johannesburg, I hear,
Is safe as Piccadilly; plies her trades;
Is firm in land “securities” (mark the word !);
Flutters in mines; and is no more commoved
By mere guerrillas raiding down the Vaal
Or Yeomen units ambushed Lindley way,
Than we of Lombard Street would bate our breath
At news of costers camped i' th' Old Kent Road
Or Radical meetings rushed at Peckham Rye.
THE DRURY LANE SISTER ANNE-UAL.
IF by this time Mr. ARTHCR Collins, Managing Director of
Drury Lane, does not know how to produce a Pantomime,
and what sort of Pantomime should be produced in order to
achieve success, neither he nor anyone else ever will. Of
course the Pantomime of Blue Beard, written by Messrs.
WooD and COLLINS and produced by the aforesaid ARTHUR
COLLINS, with music by J. M. GLOVER, Composer, Selector,
and Arranger (“Three single gentlemen rolled into one ''),
is, as a fairy spectacle, a perfect festival of harmonies in
colour. Artistic taste, originality, and ingenuity are here
combined with delightful effect. The eye is never wearied
during these brilliant scenes, and thus has considerable
advantage over the ear; for, with the exception of Dan LENO
as Sister Anne, Messrs. QUEEN and LE BRUN (whose
“ elephant,” a masterpiece of trunk and hose, is a dumb
animal, by the way), Mr. ARTITUR CONQUEST as “ The Monster
Head” (following, so to speak, in his father's footsteps), Blue
Beard's six saucy old wives, and, occasionally, Mr. HERPERT
CAMPBELL as Blue Beard himself, there is not much,
spoken or sung, that is particularly amusing ; though in
Miss RAYENSBERG as Selim (not to be pronounced S'lim),
Miss JULIA FRANKS, singing charmingly as Fatima, Miss
MADGE GIRDLESTONE as Abdullah (bearing a curious but strik-
ing facial resemblance to Miss IRENE VANBRUGH), and Madame
GRIGOLATI with her Flying Fays, there is a great deal to be
admired and listened to with pleasure.
Still, after all, Dan LENO is the pantomime, and, from first
to last, whatever absurd disguises he may assume, whatever
utterly idiotic “business” he may be doing, we depend for
the “laughs” solely and only on him. Comic elephant
would have small chance without comic element provided by
DAN LENO.
Mr. LAURENCE CAIRD, who may be remembered as the
clever impersonator of the Foreign President in last year's
pantomime, can do very little with his ear trumpet as the
deaf Hassarac, a part that is as long and as thin as himself.
There are no songs, comic or sentimental, that “catch on,"
except, perhaps, a sort of “coon song” (wherein the over-
worked coon may be making its final effort), and Dan LEXO's
burlesque imitation of this style of ditty with a chorus of
Blue Beard's wives. As Sister Anne playing a fantasia on
the harp, DAN LENO has had a most harpy inspiration. Of
course it is all a success, an annual success, and should well
repay the vast outlay of time, trouble, and money for the
public delectation.
Our old friend Mr. HAND-AND-GLOVER, in the orchestra,
works as hard as ever, while that special curl of raven-black
hair o'er the forehead, waving, with the excitement of the
moment, in time and tune, reminds some musicians present
of another LOCKE not unassociated with "Flying by Night.”
Success to the Drury Lane Annual; and if Manager
A. COLLINS could but see his way to playing his panto-
mime from 7.30 to 11, giving from 10.15 to a first-rate
Harlequinade, it would, there's no doubt about it, be a
move in a popular and profitable direction. Why, in a
real “ Transformation Scene,” should not Mr. CAIRD become
Harlequin, one of the GRIGOLATIS be the Columbine, Mr. FRED
EMNEY come out as Pantaloon, HERBERT CAMPBELL as Shop-
keeper or Policeman, and Dan LENO as Cloun? Then let us
have “All the fun of the fair" in the “comic scenes.”

Anyhow, AYLWIN got
Home long before the dawn;
And when the poem starts the servants spot
Him prowling round the lawn.
He thought his house bereaved,
His wife and infant dead,
That story he implicitly believed,
And this was what he said :-
“Cairo, your tales were true!-
Save from the servants' hall
The lightless windows tell of funeral rue
Or worse than funeral.
" Another fateful sign!-
Our good Welsh servants leave
The doors ajar for one whose soul may pine
For home on Christmas Eve.
“Are they the self-same waits-
Is that the self-same lay---
She heard last year when through the home park gates
They trod the cedarn way?"
No wonder that it pained
Poor AYLWIN more than all
To find the same old waits being entertained
Down in the servants' hall !
And then the self-same lay,
Under the winter moon,
Quavering lugubrious down the “ cedarn way,"
As usual, out of tune!

A NEW YEAR'S NIGHTMARE.
[The following touching poem is a sort of running commentary on Mr.
THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON's Idyll of Aylwin Hall, entitled “The Christmas
Dream,” which occupied several columns of the Saturday Review a couple of
weeks ago. It follows Mr. Watts-DUNTON in the use of explanatory
footnotes.)
BENEATH a moon that hangs
Silvering valley and slope
Re-enter Mr. Aylwin," "stung by fangs
Of Fear at war with Hope.'
Where had our AYLWIN been ?
To Egypt-lucky man !--
To winter with the wily Bedouin
All in a caravan.
But one day as he lead
His camel out to water
Someone informed him that his wife was dead,
Also his infant daughter.
Imagine his distress
At these heart-rending tales ;
He felt he couldn't very well do less
Than hurry home to Wales.
Meantime his tender wife,
Who loved her lord with passion,
Had heard, poor soul, that he had lost his life
In some unpleasant fashion.
So far you think the plot
Is dull and rather gory?
It is. But fortunately I am not

name of the heroine was Whinney Whinney.
+ Nor am I responsible for the metre.
I skip a page or so and turn to where
Our AYLWIN drops that metre in despair.
For the short line he substitutes a longer,
And here the humorous element grows stronger.
I like the part about “the slopes of Latmos,'
Which rhyme-too obviously perhaps ?—with “ Patmos."
(I wonder why he never thought of " that moss"?)
And those delicious lines about the Nile,
And poor “Old Christmas sitting on a stile"
(Sitting, I hope and think, on Aylwin's style)
Who told the child, “Your father 's just come home,
It 's me, old Father Christmas, made him come,
It's me that saved him from the crocodile
That comes in dreams : you know his frightful smile!”
(The smiling crocodile, it here appears,
Is quite as horrid as the one in tears.)
And how I'd like to see a fairy lattice
Across a picture which it “ seems to brattice,"
-But only Mr. SKEAT can tell what that is!
And Egypt's sun which “ cracks the horny warts
Of camels sinking in the pitiless blaze !"
The warts of camels! What a splendid phrase!
Persons who haunt Egyptian health-resorts
Should shun a camel suffering from warts !
Is this the sun, he cries, “whose heat would crack
My lips and glue them to the teeth's enamel
And dry each waterskin upon the pack
And melt the lump* from every thirsty camel ?"
I must confess I think the teeth 's enamel
Makes a most creditable rhyme to camel.
In fact the great and glorious conclusion
That I have drawn from this sublime effusion
Is--that it's written in the Book of Fate
That AYLWIN must be our next Laureate ! H.

ANY WRITER TO ANY READER.
Look! there she goes, that woman over there
With flashing arms and strands of sun-red hair.
Her figure finely moulded, see, is shown
To great advantage in her gorgeous gown.
Her movements, as you say, most graceful, but
I trace therein a tendency to strut,
A conscious springing on superior toe.
That woman walks the best that seems to flow.
Her beauty strikes you on the instant's gaze,
Yet ere you can exhaust your stock of praise
Its grandeur fades; you see a high held chin
And looks lit by no radiance from within.
A dignity by too much art sustained,
A pride by care and industry maintained.
And though the glory of her every part
Enchains the eye, it does not touch the heart.
Yet there was once a time when even I bent
Adoring knees and thought the time well spent.
But she was less imposing then. I mean
Her loveliness was rather felt than seen.
A child of nature, breathing rural joys,
Unspoiled by town, unsullied by its toys.
And how exclusive! Now who cares may get
At once admitted to her little set.
Listen! she speaks, a rich melodious tone.
But ah! that liquid murmuring note is gone,
While in the place of her once gentle smile
That breathed of Heaven to coldest bibliophile
She laughs in an accommodating way,
But whether at or with you, who shall say ?
Time was, too, when this many-virtued fair
Disdained her wondrous beauties to compare
With others less endowed. Now she prefers
A syndicate of friendly trumpeters
Who shrill : “She's virtuous, good, to be desired
And, understood or not, to be admired!"
When first I wooed this lady from afar
She had not learned to ride a motor car
Or deck with priceless gems her sumptuous gown
And live but in a well lime-lighted zone.
Since she keeps open house and entertains
Each dainty fleshling with quick-sprouting brains,
Only to whisper promises and laugh
To think how she will never keep e'en half,
I merely nod, 'tis nothing to my taste
To be in public drawing-rooms thus embraced.
You seem to know her face! I'll tell you why,
Her portrait you can any day espy
In magazines, newspapers, and, no doubt,
A longish column on her “coming out."
Oh! I've got over that. What is her name?
Forgive a smile-men call the creature Fame!

ANY number of cadets can play at this
popular game. One of the players

touched, the company stretcher-bearers
will go through such part of their drill
as may be necessary, until the cadet
in question has recovered, when he
becomes Touch, and in turn strives to
touch one of the others. When Touch
succeeds in touching another, he cries
“Feign double-touch!” which signifies
that the player so touched must not
retaliate on the cadet who stunned
or attempted to stun him, until he
has belted somebody else. A capital
variation is made by touching with
bayonets.
“High BARBADEE !”
This is a very spirited game, and,
like “Widdy,” is peculiarly adapted for
wintry weather. Sides are chosen from
the cadets, and one company or
“commando" takes cover while the
other remains “at home” in a block-
house surrounded by high barbed wire

So on a day Sir BELCHAMP PORTE-DRAPEAU
Drew with his faithful remnant, what there was,
To that weird battle down by Westminster.
And o'er his head, he going delicately,
The banner of the great C.-Bannermanship ..
Drooped ; and athwart its folds the clan's device,
A sporran'd haggis fluttered, and, below,
The Campbell is a-coming ran the script.
But from his sinister arm was slung the shield
That bore for blazonry a barbéd fence,
And therewithal the rede, J'y suis, j'y reste.
And by his side the sword X-calibre."
(For so they styled it, since in point of proof
The blade was deemed an unknown quantity)
Swung like a pendulum ; and on his flank,
As one that should beguile the Chieftain's gloom
With jest and ribald joyaunce, lightly rode
That loyal knight Sir LAB DE BOOM-LE-VRAI
In devious caracoles; and as he rode
Now hummed a jocund air-Peers, idle peers,
And now with aching midriff mused aloud
Of “forty millions, mostly flannelled fools”;
So swift his fancy played.
But he, the Chief,
Heard, or heard not, and either way was deaf
To jest and ribald joyaunce. Yet he heard,
Or out of mist-like memory seemed to hear,
Far-off a voice that ever in his ears
Rang hollow from the trenches, crying “ Spades!”
And on the word, low muttering to his heart :
“O me! for much has changed since bold Sir BRUM
Clave to the Table Round; and much again
· Since I, with those four knights, Sir COP-LA-POULE,
Sir FIFE, Sir GRIS DU JEU-DE-PAUME, and him
Sir DURDANS, newly named of Chesterfield,
Rode out to break the heathen! Now I hear
How these, with others, loyal-seeming all,
Are leagued against me, while the heathen wait,
Watching the issue like a Ping-pong bye,
To rise and take the breathless victors on.
An evil chance it were for any chief
To move against his own elect and strike;
For so the pain he deals he deals himself
Two-fold or even more, which needs must be
Most painful.”
Then Sir Lab, that overheard :
“What plaint is this, my Chief, of rival powers ?
Light was my lord of Durdans at the best,
And under any name would be as light.
I count him but the foam that flecks the wave,
Dazzling a while, but shortly doomed to pass
Adown the wandering wind. But you, my liege,
I know you for the dark unfathomed deep
That may not easily pass.”
Thereat the Chief :
“O ay, not easily pass, not easily pass,
If visions hold. Methought, a moon agone,
I jousted at the Bridge with certain churls,
And had, for mate, Sir DURDANS ; and the score
(Two points to twenty-six and one game up)
Favoured the heathen slightly. Then I dealt,
And, dealing, drew a hand of five small hearts,
Topped by the ten, and all the residue
Damnably dull, and gazed thereon, and passed.

recognise the trenchant style.] .
DEAR MR. PUNCH, — Just reached Melbourne. Raining
hard. What a chance for maneuvres for First Australian
Mounted Infantry! Unhappily impossible. Rifles and
lordliest life on earth must give place to preposterous cricket

Vast crowd of spectators. Possibly arid, but apparently not
incurious. Very odd! Presently English captain appears
pushing his men raw to the battle. In other words, our side
in first. Around them stand a band of little people, few
but apt in the field. Good fielding essential, I am told. I
notice there are only eleven of them. It seems a small
number! But, as events proved, quite able to dispose of our
striplings, who, I am told, are street-bred.
Presently one of our flannelled fools goes to the wicket.

Silly fellow, he would be much better employed firing

THERE are only two practical arts in
modern life, the art of getting money
and the art of living comfortably on
people who have already got it. There
used to be a third, the art of living
contentedly and independently without
money, but that art is confessedly
obsolete. By “money” I mean, of
course, money enough to purchase the
comforts which by our modern standard
are considered necessary, such as
broughams, champagne, cigars, stalls in
the theatre and the society of the
successful, and to procure (if desired)
the respect of one's fellow countrymen.
The great majority, therefore, are
reduced to the second art, and must
do their best to perfect themselves as
guests. To them I venture to make a
few suggestions for the fortunate prac-
tice of this art, inferior to the greatest,
no doubt, in the consideration of the
vulgar, but scarcely distinguishable, if
pursued with real genius, in its results.
The Perfect Guest, for example, lives in
precisely the same manner as the success-
ful money-maker, his host; often, indeed,
more freely; for, whereas many men have
an inborn dislike of wasting their money
by the excessive assumption of good
things, no man yet was so mean as to
dislike wasting other people's. More-
over, if the host's wealth vanishes,
which sometimes happens even out of
novels, the Perfect Guest, unaffected,
goes to ply his charming accomplish:
ments elsewhere. Also, he is saved the
fag of writing cheques.
My suggestions for perfection can
begin only with those who are already
guests. I cannot tell the uninvited man
how to get invitations. Accident and a
natural instinct--superior, surely, to
the boasted instincts of the lower
animals--for making up to people with

AV ÆGEAN “MONTE”;
Or, A Fresh Pilgrimage for Childe Harold.
[According to the Pall Mall Gazette, a certain PYTHAGORE YEPOS YtCTIOS
(sic), acting for a Belgian Syndicate, has obtained a ninety-nine years con-
cession from the Chamber of Samos for a great gambling establishment in the
island, in return for which he promises all kinds of local improvements. The
inhabitants of Samos are seemingly to be barred the rooms.)
vii.
Did Karlovassi, now the premier town,
By name suggest a Monte Carlo new
For the three rogues of Levantine renown,
To wit, the Turk of Egripo, the Jew
Bred in Salonica-I'll not pursue
The proverb further, lest we should offend
Athenian friends, were this to meet their view.
Whate'er the reason, few can comprehend
Why Belgian syndicates on this isle should descend.
1.
VIII.
Still, there are glorious times ahead, we hear,
For Samos--roads, a central hospital,
A steamship service straightway will appear;
PYTHAGORAS has promised, free to all,
These luxuries, soon as the drachmai fall
In his expectant coffers. “Make, then, haste,''
He cries,“ responsive to the croupier's call,"
Though possibly his clients have small taste
For voyaging to islands so remotely placed.
IX.
The regulations, which seem rather rough
On Samian sportsmen, have been framed to bar
The local talent playing, and rebuff
The native hayduk, klepht or palikar,
Whose aboriginal ways might cause a jar!
As for CHILDE HAROLD, I've forgotten quite
Where on the road we left him and how far
He'd yet to travel—but 'twas e'er his plight
In th' earlier Cantos to endure such oversight !
SELF-EXILED HAROLD wanders forth again
With more of hope this time and less of gloom,
And, though his previous pilgrimage was vain,
He fortune tempts once more this side the tomb;
Some private knowledge bade his soul resume
The endless quest, and naught of failure reck,
The bankrupt's exit and the gambler's docm.
Eastward he fares, ne on a galiot's deck,
But per a modern steamboat that no wind may check.
II.
O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea
(This handy and familiar verse applies
Here to th' Ægean, now 'tis fairly free
Of pirates) in an extra Canto flies
CHILDE HAROLD, eager for his certain prize;
'Twas sure, of course, for lately he had learned-
A lord hight Rosslyn taught him, wondrous wise--
How thousands in a minute might be earned,
And (somewhat previously) believed his luck had turned.
III.
There is a tide in the affairs of men
('Gad, how these lines do haunt one!), and the same
Holds good of isles -a statement I would pen
Especially of Samos, which could claim
A spring-tide and a world-resounding name
Five hundred years and more B.C., when rose
POLYCRATES of art-befriending fame,
And sage PYTHAGORAS, who could disclose
Each riddle of the Universe to whom he chose.
IV.
Concerning Samos in her time of pride
HERODOTUS, we find, is eloquent;
She had a harbour where with ease could ride
Ten thousand triremes, and, of like extent,
The fane of Hera, more magnificent
Than any shrine of Eld; but alien hands
And earth-upheavals have its splendours rent,
Till, where Colonna Cape the strait commands
Of Mycalé, but one lone beadless column stands.
".
There was a second tide (of neap degree)
In scanty Samian history, which flowed
A half-millennium later :--ANTONY
And CLEOPATRA took up their abode
Within these shores, a lurid episode
Which painted Samos red, e'en as its ware;
Dulness from then till now has been the mode,
A certain sameness (note this pun with care !)
Has governed matters 'neath its soft Ionian air.
vi.
Until--this point I should have reached before-
One morning fine last month the isle awoke
To find a second M. PYTHAGORE
(His surname seems a wild misprinter's joke)
Had got permission by some master-stroke
To raise--for ninety-nine years runs the lease-
A temple where the punter may invoke
The Goddess of Roulette and thus increase
The directorial revenue without surcease.
OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
Blackwood's Magazine has been singularly fortunate in
its contribution to the inner history of the war in South
Africa. Words by 'an Eye Witness, “LINESMAN,” a series
of vivid word-pictures of life on the battlefield by day and
by night, first appeared in its pages. The papers, which
the writer modestly describes as “ written hastily from the
seat of war in the intervals of the events they describe," are
now issued in book form (BLACKWOOD). In the current num-
ber of the venerable but virile Maga there appears the first
of a fresh series of papers from a new pen. On the Heels of
De Wet, it is called, and describes the birth of the brigade.
Gentlemen of England who live at home at ease, go to bed
after a good dinner, sleep soundly, and wake to find their
bath and breakfast awaiting them, should not omit studying
this brief record of a day's experience on the way to the
front. Munching their muffin, toying with their toast, they :
testily turn over the morning paper and marvel why things
have “gone wrong again.” Here they will find, quietly :
told, how men who at any moment may be called upon to
take sudden decision on momentous issues to fight for their
lives in the midnight swoop of the enemy, pass the twenty-
four hours. Half-starved, worn out with long marches, cut
off from sleep and the minor comforts of the average coster-
monger, they daily, sometimes twice a day, lapse into
battle. The anonymous author occupies only five pages.
They bring the reality of the situation before the mind's eye
more vividly than anything my Baronite has yet read in
the long-drawn-out story of the war. Having Blackwood in
hand, don't omit to read Master Tartar. Nothing so good
in its way has been written since the far-off days when
Rab and His Friends were introduced to a delighted world.

Mr. DOYLE thought he had finished his
task when he laid down his pen in
September, 1900. The main army of
the Boers was then dispersed, and, as
we all remember, the Government were
so certain that the War was over they
straightway rushed into a general elec-
tion. My Baronite finds it quite pathetic
to come upon the historian sitting
down thirteen months later and cudgel-
ling his brain to find a phrase that will
not clash with the position he assumed
in the autumn of 1900. He explains,
something after the fashion of Benedick,
that when in September of that year
he said the War was over he did not
think he would live to find the Boers
still fighting in October, 1901. All he
meant was that we had “come to the
end of the regular operation.” What
has followed has been sadly irregular,
but demands record. This Mr. DOYLE
supplies up to date, in the same vivid,
impartial, condensed, yet comprehensive
manner that marked his earlier effort,
securing for it at once a high position
among books of English history.
In Tales of Past Times (J. M. DENT
& Co.), told by Master CHARLES PERRAULT,
the Baron welcomes his dear “old

this time next year with “new faces"

* Charles,” be it noted, not “Jack
Robinson," of whom nowadays no one
ever hears. The formula used to be,
“So-and-so (whatever it was) shall be
done before you can say 'Jack Robin-

deftly stepped in and done these draw-
ings before the dilatory Jack could even
be mentioned, and so “Jack, R.A."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 15, 1902.
The Empire Theatre, Highbury, has
recently been the scene of a pantomime
revival of the highest artistic excellence.
The story to which was given so beautiful
a setting was that of Jack the Giant
Killer. Mr. J-S-PH CH-MB-RL-N's imper-
sonation of Jack left nothing to be
desired, he being especially good in the
scene in which the giant (played by Mr.
P-W-LLW-LL-MS and Mr. A-ST-N CH-MB-RL-N,
the former standing upon the shoulders
of the latter) is slain. The giant, it was
noticed, wore a German uniform, this
delightfully piquant idea no doubt
being due to Mr. C'H-MB-RL-N, whose
happy feeling for the appropriate is
well known. Many hearts were lost to
the Fairy Queen (played by Mr. J-SSE
C-LL-NGS), whose truly regal beauty enrap-
tured everyone. Immediately upon the
death of the giant, Mr. CH-MB-RL-N,
standing upon that unfortunate's body,
sang with great expression the well-
known song, “ Let 'em all come,” the
whole house joining in the chorus.
Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE was not present.
Dick Whittington, at the Theatre
Mentmore, has been drawing crowded
audiences. Lord R-S-B-Ry, whose appear-
ance as Dick was a great success, was
well seconded by his GREY cat. Thun-
derous was the applause as Dick, attired
as a simple rural person, is seen to turn
again towards London. A new song,

THE BARGAN HUNTERS.
A TRAGI-COMEDY OF SUBURBAN LIFE.
The scene represents the exteriorof a large
West End drapery emporium which,
at the present time of 9.25 a.m. is
plentifully embellished with labels
bearing such alluring announce-
ments as “Gigantic Sale Now
Proceeding,” “Heart-rending Sacri-
fices," "Leviathan Bargains,”
“ Stock-taking Sale," and other
mottoes calculated to cheer the femi-
nine heart and to make waterthe rose-
bud mouth. The three main doors of
the establishment are thronged about
by a restless crowd of women in all
the advanced stages of expectancy
and excitement. As the crucial
hour of 9.30 approaches, when the
great “sacrifices” are to be offered
up for “absolutely less than cost
price,” the crowds grow and widen,
extending outwards in ever-swaying
queues over pavement and curb into
the road itself. There is a tense,
tight-lipped determination on the
pale, drawn faces turned so anxi-
ously towards the doors. As the
clock strikes the half-hour these
are flung apart by tall, liveried
janitors and three overwhelming
torrents of womanhood flood the
building. Stifled cries of, “Don't
push, please ! ” “ And you call your-
self a lady!” “You're on my
dress!” “Oh! my umbrella!”
“ Mind you don't get your purse

INSTANS SENECTA.
DEAR JACK, what 's this? My word upon it,
A bee is buzzing in your bonnet.
These solemn words, precise and slow,
Are not the little lad I know,
So young, so cheerfully addressed
To frolic fun and laughing jest ;
So careless what the days may bring,
If but himself may have his fling;
So apt to pour his scorn on those
Who ponderously prate and prose
Of age that weighs and care that clings,
And all the other hateful things
That mar the brow and bend the back
Of some--but never come to JACK.
How is it, JACK, that you resent
My little birthday compliment?
“At twenty-five,” you write, “a man
Forgets his birthdays if he can.
With twice twelve years all stowed behind him,
It's hardly tactful to remind him
That, lo! a twenty-fifth is gone,
And still old Time keeps pegging on.
Once, long ago, I looked on birthdays
As unalloyed delightful mirth-days.
The candles on the cake, that mark
One's score of years, seemed just a lark.
Would that they had remained the same
But every year another came;
And still, while swift my youth was going,
The hateful number kept a-growing,
Until-I heard the cook declare it-
No merely mortal cake would bear it.
That stamped me old ; so spare me, pray,
Allusions to my natal day.”
Poor Jack! But, ah, I can remember
When life to me seemed all December.
There shone no sun to make me warm,
But all was cloud and gathering storm,
A bleak grey sky, a prospect drear,
And over all a voice rang clear
Through wind and rain and sleet and snow:: :
“Gone is your youth, gone long ago!”
It was, as I recall, the time
When life was flushing in its prime.
Cambridge had done with me, no doubt,
But then she had not flung me out:
Degreed I left her—'tis no rare case ;
Another's name was on my staircase;
And in my comfortable room
Another dwelt, and heard the broom
And all the matutinal stir
Of Mrs. J., the bedmaker.
To him henceforth she would devote
Her widow's cruse of anecdote,
And use for him, but not for me,
A tongue that wagged incessantly.
In short I was a fresh B.A.,
And should have been, but wasn't, gay.
Plunged into London's flooded stream
I felt that I had dreamed my dream.
To gloom and fancied age I clung-
And yet I was superbly young.
And now, good lack, it makes me smile
To hear you use my ancient style.
Heaven help you, JACK, your clear blue eye
Gives all such fancy-talk the lie.
Go to, 'tis but a waking pain ;
You 'll fall asleep and dream again,
And in your dreams) you 'll wander free
Through life and all its pageantry,
And follow still the fleeting glory
Until—but that 's another story
And now, if you 'll withhold your stricture,
I'll dip my brush and paint a picture;
So, Jack, attend, and try to suit your
Imagination to the future.
Double your years—that makes 'em fifty :
Behold a housewife neat and thrifty-
She knows his tempers through and througlı-
Stands by her portly man-that's you.
Your little girls, two dainty trippers,
Bring you their gifts of socks and slippers.
Your boy-he stroked his College boat
And hopes to wear your old blue coat--
Forbears awhile your education,
And offers his congratulation,
And hints, at ease, the cool young sinner,
At birthday fare and fizz for dinner!
And you, I fancy, seem to find
A birthday fairly to your mind.
You chaff the lad, and lightly touch
On boys who seem to know too much.
“A youth to-day,” you 'll laugh, “is rather
More aged than his ancient father.
And, oh, forgive me, but-ahem !-
Those Cambridge bills, Sir--what of them?”
So, JACK, repent: why, man alive,
You 've just begun at twenty-five !

... “A CROWDED and enthusiastic
meeting which served once more to
demonstrate the unanimity of public
feeling on our South African policy.
The chief speaker of the evening had a
magnificent reception, and, amid the
perfunctory applause of a few hirelings,
repeated some of those fatuous inepti-
tudes which represent his stock of
political wisdom. A more complete
fiasco cannot be imagined, nor one
more likely to dishearten everyone who
took part in a demonstration which,
from start to finish, was a brilliant and
unqualified success. Having pulverised
the arguments of his opponents, he
failed utterly to refute that exposure of
his folly which his opponents have
made many times over. With his
closing remarks — the words of an
unselfish patriot and a blatantly con-
ceited Jingo-our readers will concur
most heartily, feeling that they attain
to a depth of idiocy which even this
speaker has not previously compassed,
honourable and meritorious as his
lengthy career has been.”

CHARLES MATHEWS writes of Count
D'ORSAY about this period, that his pro-
nunciation of English was peculiar. He
spoke it as a foreigner, but he had never
mastered it; he preferred his native
tongue, and avoided writing letters in
English. CHARLES MATHEWS says in Vol.
II., p. 129, of his memoirs : “I tell him
that if you were to hear him speak
English-which he does in the prettiest
manner--that you could not refrain from
kissing him.” On second thoughts,
though, had Mr. TREE exactly repro-
duced the Count's way of speaking
English the effect might have been
demoralising. So 'tis better left as it
is. In another week's time the Dandy

With uppers cracked and leaking,
Still seeking, seeking, seeking

A SUGGESTION BY OUR NERVOUS CONTRIBUTOR, WHO IS CONVINCED THAT, IF HIS IDEA WERE PROPERLY CARRIED OUT, THE PLEASURE
OF HUNTING WOULD BE IMMENSELY INCREASED.
CRUMBS OF PITY.
KEEN is the morning, keen and bright,
And all the lawn with frost is white;
In every bush, in every tree,
The birds sit watching warily.
Now out, now in, they hop and peer,
And cock their cunning heads to hear
The chirping of a childish voice :
They know it well, and they rejoice
When, resolutely stepping, comes,
To scatter here her gift of crumbs,
Her round face topped with shining curls,
My little laughing girl of girls.
And, O ye soft and feathered things,
Redbreasts who flit on fearless wings,
Familiar, friendly, boldly shy,
Birds of the liquid, trustful eye;
Ye sparrows chattering o'er your food,
Linnets, and all the pretty brood
Of finches, blackbirds yellow-billed,
And thrushes with your music stilled-
Since winter's icy breath makes mute
The swelling ripple of your flute;
Ye, too, ye sable-suited rooks,
Timid for all your threatening looks,
Who in solemnity survey
Your twittering colleagues at their play,
Where on the poplar's top you swing,
And desperately claw and cling,
Then, when each bird has pecked its last,
And all the fluttering rout is past,
And all the chirpings duly dumb,
Swoop down, but rarely find a crumb;
All ye, whose hungry bills are fed
By Helen's daily doles of bread,
Be not afraid, be not afraid
To gather round my rosy maid.
Oh, give a kindly thought to her,
Your little friend and minister;
And, as you watch her, pass the word —
“She's but a plump unfeathered bird.”
So when the day is done, and night
Sets all the twinkling stars alight,
You 'll breathe a bird-wish, as you sleep,
That One who guards the birds may keep
Cosy and safe from every ill,
From winds that bite and frosts that chill,
And through the night's long hours defend
The birds' unfeathered little friend.
Ye sportive mice that swiftly go
Behind the wainscot to and fro,
And sometimes to your outlets creep
And half pop out and take a peep,
Alert, but ready to retreat
Into a world where cheese smells sweet-
Ye quivering, twisting specks of fur
With whisking tails and ears astir,
We do not grudge you of our store :
A little less, a little more,
It matters not, so nibble on
In peace, then like a flash begone.
I cannot bear to bar the house
To here and there a tiny mouse.
And Helen, if she marks at all
Your scamperings from wall to wall,
Will smile to hear you frisk and run:
“It 's mousies, Daddy, having fun.”'

MR. CROKER'S FAREWELL.
f" The admirers of Mr. CROKER, the late “ Bogs"
of Tammany, have presented him with some massive
silver plate in recognition of his services during
the late municipal elections. Mr. CROKER, when
receiving it, reiterated his intention of' with-
drawing from Politics forever, and said that he
intended to sail for England on Wednesday.”—
Laffan.]
'Tis hard to say “Farewell,'' dear friends,
But here our long connection ends.
I've worked for Tammany for years,
At length we part—and part in tears !
The compliments that fall from you
I take them, since they are my due ;
Also this piece of silver plate,
Because my services were great.
I take them and I make my bow,
I'm going to live in England now;
To-day, dear friends, our ties must sever,
I give up politics forever!
No longer victory crowns our toils,
And leaves us pocketing the spoils ;
No longer can we give our hosts
Of followers agreeable posts.
No longer under my directions
Poor Tammany controls elections ;
We've had our triumphs in the past,
But even We have failed at last !
I really thought that we should win,
But we are out and Low is in,
A state of things which, you must see,
Is most disheartening to me.
And so (by general desire)
I have decided to retire ;
The burden 's more than I can bear--
And votes are dearer than they were.
Some new expedient must be tried

As for your martial trappings, We suggest
That you should not employ your very best,
Because they keep a habit, so one hears,
Sprung of a sentiment for souvenirs,
Which lets their women carry off by storm
Outlying portions of your uniform.
But if, dear HENRY, they should go too far,
And treat you like that other naval star,
Lieutenant HOBSON; if, in fact, they seek
To kiss collectively your cherished cheek ;
If natural homage takes this parlous line-
You will unhesitatingly decline;
For though it is not in Our wish to thwart
Any advances of a friendly sort,
This kind you should discourage all you can,
As is becoming in a married man.
Now, in conclusion, HENRY, We repeat
This trip of yours is not a private treat ;
You go, as We observed but yester-week,
To forge a link in Our Welt-Politik;
Your business is, by captivating hearts,
To bolster up Our tottering Teuton marts;
So that Our gracious attitude may earn
Something by way of tangible return.
But O be cautious! do not unawares
Become the prey of multi-millionaires !
For you will find among this fertile nation
A tendency toward buying up. Creation ;
And, as MEDUSA's petrifying gaze
Converted men to stone in mythic days,

HOPE FOR THE BEST AT THE GARRICK.
["A play is not to show occurrences that happen every day, but things just
80 strange that, though they never did, they might happen."-The Critic.]
Tuis piece might easily, and with greater dramatic effect,
have been constructed in three acts. In what may be termed
the “latter-patter” days of CHARLES MATHEWS, the materials
that have been used to make Pilkerton's Peerage at the
Garrick would have served a skilled dramatist for an hour's
light comedy at the Lyceum.
During three acts it is chiefly a drama of “Dolly
Dialogues,” with stage directions artistically carried out.
Pilkerton wants a peerage ; the Prime Minister's private
secretary “wishes he may get it”; Pilkerton does get it
by incidentally threatening to make himself politically objec-
tionable, and, directly, by giving his daughter, “ with a
werry large fortune in silver and gold,” to the aforesaid
antagonistic Private Secretary. Strange, but quite possible.
Three acts pass in the Private Secretary's room in the official
residence of the Premier, in Downing Street, which apart-
ment seems to have been designed by an architect with no
inconsiderable experience in the scenic requirements of most
French farces, although one of the properties usually valuable
in such scenes, that is, a screen, is absolutely on the stage for
three acts, without anybody, male or female, being concealed
behind it! Strange, again, but quite possible. This is
indeed a bold departure from tradition. Only occasionally
does Mr. BOURCHIER retire behind it--that is, in front of it-
in order to give his hair a brush up, and, of course,
keeping himself well in view of the audience. A screen
on the stage is a cumbersome property, as, when it is
not essential to the action, it attracts attention and is an
inartistic item. Among all the memorable “screen scenes,”
from the great original in The School for Scandal, down
to that clever one in Lady Windermere's Fan, this in
Pilkerton's Peerage must stand out as unique.
We may lack dramatists, but we have actors and acting.
A thin plot, no “situations,” sharp dialogue delivered at a
rattling pace by actors in a hurry, whose occasional pause
for breath suggests to the audience that there must be
some point worth attention in the sentence they have just
uttered. But Mr. Hope's genuine epigrams, when he treats us
to them, need neither measured tone nor weighty manner.

ON WHAT CONSTITUTES THE “LORDLIEST LIFE.”
No, I am one who never cared to waste
The fleeting leisure wrung from honest toil
On cant of poets' columns in the Times.
Mind you, I make no quarrel with the scribes,
Who have to earn their pittance how they can ;
But when I take my morning's sheet in hand
I look to feed my brain on useful fact-
The copper slump, the imminent rise in oil,
Peace-rumours, how they touch the Kaffir mart,
Pig-iron, what the punters make of that,
For these I look, and not to slake my lust,
Never too warm, on literary ware.
That's why your KIPLING's rhyme had left me cold,
Being overlooked amid more vital themes,
But for the clamour roused i' th' popular breast
(Fatuous from the first and now effete)
To find its heroes damned for doddering fools.
'Tis time one spoke the clinching word thereon :
And, though you rightly laugh to see me ranged
Among this class of prophet, I protest
Up to a certain point I'm with the bard.
I too contend our England's youth is sapped
By this deplorable waste of time and wit
Lavished upon a bounding leather ball,
Being owed to something higher; owed, in fact,
To the “ lordliest life” our earth has got to show.
Only-and here our arguments diverge,
Mine and the poet's-we are not at one
Touching this lordliest life, just which it is.
He says “ the Martial ” ; T," the Millionaire's”;
And score a personal point (mere proof aside),
Seeing I practise what ideal I preach,
And live the lordliest life my soul conceives ;
While he, ecstatic on the militant state,
Remains civilian poet: one to me.
Which said, I stand upon impartial fact,
And, waiving private vantage, argue case.
For what 's the life he lauds save means to end---
Commerce the end, 'defensive force the means ?
How should the means be “lordlier” than the end ?
He speaks of abstract honour? Then he speaks
A Middle-ages' jargon! What's a flag
Unless it symbolise the nation's trade?
And, this away, what 's left to fight about ?
One doesn't die for joy of painted Jacks;
I don't myself, at least, if others do;
Nor yet, what's more, is that the luxury
For which I pay expensive troops to fight,
Being taxed thereto at fourteen pence i' th' pound.
No, there your Kipling gets above himself,
Talking Crusaders' prattle.
Still, I say,
Up to a certain point I'm with your man.
He has an eye unerringly remarks
The fatal microbe which infects the time.
For what, I ask, would be the state to-day
Of Britain's back bone had her coming men,
Her nascent millionaires, beguiled the hour
In flannelled dalliance over bat and ball
Beyond their sixteenth year, the plastic age
For taking on your true commercial mould ?
One dares not think on it; and KIPLING 's right
Who lays instinctively his poet's thumb
Upon the germ that undermines our health.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Tales of Dunstable Weir (METHUEN) are worthy of the lady
who prefers to be known as Zack, which is saying a good
deal. By a coincidence, of course undesigned, probably
unknown, her first tale, “Benjamin's Parrot's Fancy,” is
based on the same idea as MARK TWAIN's The Man that
Corrupted Hadleyburg. A stranger comes into a remote
village, announces that he is prepared to leave all his money
to the first man that takes his fancy, enchains the population,
dies, and is found to be absolutely insolvent. ZACK shares
the plot with MARK. But the humour, the delightful self-
revelation of the cunning and meanness of the hero's bucolic
nature (glorified in his dealing with Amelia Anne Spot) are
her own. “The Hall and He,” the longest tale of the
seven, shows us a lad, shrewd, selfish, greedy, an admirable
foil to the devotion of his mother, and the hopeless despair
of her foster son. There is a caustic humour about ZACK
my Baronite finds refreshing. Here are a couple of flashes
on a single page, describing the family of Kitty Fevvens's
husband, who "wadn't zactly mad, tho' his ideas was a bit
jammed, and he reckoned he was the village pump and had
to be fed on eggs to be kept gwaying." "There was Mat,
small and crooked-toothed, with a fine knowledge o other
folk's fowls; and Poddy Peter, the youngest lad, the zame
baing terrible anxious to do wi'out the power o’ doing, tho'
he wance picked up a druppeny-bit on the road.”
The authorship of The Trial of Man (JOHN MURRAY) is a
secret. “Anon, anon, Sir.” Perhaps it is just as well that
the strictest anonymity should in this instance be preserved.
It is a spirited but mistaken attempt to produce, in laboured
prose, effects similar to those wonderful creations of MILTON
in Paradise Lost. Had the first chapter given us a faith-
fully exact picture of monastic life, and had the remainder of
the romance been a dream of the Scrooge and Marley charac-
ter, ending with the moral improvement of the “sleeper
awakened,” there might have been some point in the
fanciful story which would then have had more interest for
the reader. The Baron cordially agrees with the author's
opinion (expressed at page 234), that “the best of devils
is bad company,” and so, after recommending the writer to
keep clear of such a very low set in his literary future, he
has nothing more to say on the subject.

MORE STATUES.
THE German Emperor, not content
with the endless erection of monuments
in Berlin, has presented to the munici-
pality of Rome a statue of GOETHE, to be
set up in a public place, and has sent to
the Syndic a telegram ending with the
following words, roughly translated from
the Berliner Tageblatt — “May his
statue, under the blue sky of the land
which he sang, and where the laurel
flourishes, form a lasting emblem of the
sincere and hearty fellow-feeling which
unites me and Germany to beautiful
Italy.”
The English version, issued by
Reuter's Agency, contained the words,
“under the blue sky where blooms the
orange-tree.” An orange-tree growing
in the sky would stagger Santos DUMONT
himself.
Having presented this possibly charm-
ing gift with these graceful words, the
KAISER will doubtless extend his and
Germany's sincere and hearty fellow-
feeling, combined with German statues,
to other cities. There is reason to believe
that the following figures, with the
accompanying dedicatory telegrams, are
about to be sent off.

WHEN the wedding presents were
arriving, AUGUSTA wept because she
was not coming to London to keep
Miss GWENDOLEN'S beautiful silver in
order. “I'd just love to clean it,” she
sobbed. “I'd have it all out on the
side-board, and there'd never be a speck
of dust on it.”
Often and often, when the fog had
played the mischief with our labours
and the general had struck at laying
another finger on the plate, did GWEN
recall AUGUSTA's words. “JACK," she
sighed, looking at the dingy brown
utensils that saddened our dining-
room, “Oh, JACK, if we only had
AUGUSTA !”
“Ah,” I sighed, sympathetically.
“Do you think she would come ?”
“We should have to give her double
the wages we pay the Marchioness, and
her fare from Aberdeen- ”.
“First-class ?” I queried.
"Anything more despicable than the
wit of the professional humorist--"
began GWENDOLEN.
“Darling, I was stupid. By all means,
let us try to get AUGUSTA. If she is
more expensive than the Marchioness is,
she will also be more effective.”
“Yes, Jack, it will be ever so much
cheaper in the end. We shan't have
to do any housework. All our time
will be free for writing. Why, we ought
to make at least another £100 a year
by it!”
"Undoubtedly," I acquiesced.
GWENDOLEN gave herself no small airs
when a letter arrived announcing that
AUGUSTA was graciously pleased to accept
our offer. To sympathetic friends who
tendered condescending, not to say con-
temptuous, enquiries after our ménage,
GWENDOLEN replied with the calm confi-

“AFTER MANY DAYS.”
MR. PUNCH, HONOURED SIR,- We have
all been laughing for at least a fortnight
at 'the Spectator's joke about “the
Hooligans” in the House of Commons.
The excellent Westminster caps it by
suggesting that the word should be
spelt “Hughligans.” Ha! ha! ..
I was just going to laugh again, when,
turning over back pages of Punch, as is
my custom of an afternoon, I came upon
the following passage in “The Diary of
Toby, M.P.,” published on July 24 last
year :
“The MARKISS has a pretty wit. One of its
flashes of late illumined the family circle. Too

and brain can still be sound, and the trunk and
the head can do good work without the distraction
of ornamental but too often useless limbs."
In itself, it would seem, this passage
is innocent enough, but it has been seized
upon and distorted both by those who
represent the extreme anti-war section of
the Party and by those who look upon
Lord ROSEBERY as a new Moses destined
to guide them to the promised land.
“Behold,” say the former, “how Lord
ROSEBERY desires us to exist. He re-
fuses to spare us even a toe or a little
finger with which to eke out our
maimed existence. Never can we stoop
to the degradation involved in this sug-
gested mutilation.” Surely this is a
somewhat violent and literal interpre-
taion to place upon remarks which we
are at liberty to believe Lord ROSEBERY
had no intention of pressing too strictly.
But, on the other hand, we can have but
little sympathy with the proposal put for-
ward by Dr. HEBER HART, and supported,
we regret to notice, by Sir EDWARD
GREY, that only those who voluntarily
submit to the loss of their limbs should
be recognised as genuine Liberals. It
is true that Sir EDWARD GREY mitigated
the harshness of his remarks by advo-
cating the use of anæsthetics in all
cases, but the suggestion does not go
far towards removing our objections to
the imposition of this new test. Our
object is to rule no man out, and though
for many reasons it might perhaps, under
different circumstances, be advisable to
adhere to the plan suggested by Lord
ROSEBERY, we can only say that we doubt
if the time has yet come for putting into
force a remedy so drastic and, after all,
so uncertain in its results.
There is room in the Liberal party for
all shades of men. The essential point
is that we should keep in view definite
aims and not lose ourselves in by-paths
of useless recrimination. The late

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
OPPORTUNELY, in view of the festival of June next, CHATTO
& WINDUS issue Crowns and Coronations, described and
recorded by Mr. WILLIAM JONES, F.S.A. It is a compendium
of information on these points that leaves nothing untold.
Colossal industry, directed by admirablo judgment, has
been devoted to the task. Mr. JONES goes back to earliest
history for descriptions of crowns and records of coronations.
Naturally what interests us most relates to the history of our
own sovereigns. Here it will be found set forth in the
picturesque style of contemporary chroniclers. From the
time of RICHARD II. to Queen VICTORIA the ceremony of
successive coronations is described. The late Lord Privy
Seal will be interested by reminder of the ceremonial that,
from Plantagenet times down to the days of the STUARTS,
attended the investment of Knights of the Bath. In those
days the Coronation Procession started from the Tower for
Westminster. A preliminary was the creation of a batch of
Knights of the Bath. The novitiate was, on the night
before the Coronation, actually tubbed, a process less
familiar then than now. Dressing after his bath, wearing
a hermit's weed of russet cloth, he kept vigil in the Church
till daybreak. When the procession started for Westminster
he joined it, and on arriving at Westminster Hall received
sword and spurs, and was dubbed knight by the Royal
hand. My Baronite dwells in mute delight on the idea of our
“Grand Cross” marching, spectacled, in russet cloth, from
his bath to keep vigil in Church sans prospect of a cigar.
For every new “Dooley Book," as is this of Mr. Dooley's

WHEN AUGUSTA first came to us she
had no friends in London. GWEN and
I had done our best to make up for the
deficiency, but there came a time when
we felt that not even the compensating
attractions of the Tivoli and the Empire
could make up for the want of more
congenial society. In a word, AUGUSTA
was blasée-such, at least, was the
thought which GWEN, who habitually
judges others by herself, declared to be
the offspring of my own unspoken wish.
At any rate, there came a lull in our
gaieties, and now, her work done,
AUGUSTA would sit apart in her lonely
kitchen gazing sadly into the fire.
In vain GWENDOLEN besought her to
go out, to look at the pretty shops,
to walk in the park. AUGUSTA refused
to budge. She had no one to go with;
she hated walking alone, and it made
her sad to see the happy couples sitting
under the trees, while she could not
even glory in a hired military escort.
Whenever GWEN and I were having our
after - dinner chat, the image of the
general crossed our minds, and at
length it became so haunting and
oppressive that GWEN urged me to
consult the neighbouring Scotch parson.
“Parson!” I gasped.
“Yes, to be sure. Have you never
heard of such a thing before? Tell
him about AUGUSTA, make him interested
in her, and get him to send up some-
one to call on her.”
My embassy was at once successful.
Scarce a day passed before visitors
began to ask for AUGUSTA, and in a
couple of months her circle had far out-
grown our own. We no longer had to

beg to call attention to their arrange-
ments for providing authors with enjoy-
able Easter vacations. Absolutely free
accommodation is offered for literary
men and women, as all expenses will be
met by public subscriptions and Govern-

themselves of this opportunity will be
able subsequently to dispose of their
work for prices hitherto beyond their
wildest dreams. At the present moment,
for example, twenty-five American pub-
lishers are bidding against one another

desirous of increasing their incomes, is
obvious.

embarked at Ramsgate for his beloved Hanover, and an
Obelisk commemorates both his departure and return.
Thenceforth Ramsgate was “Royal Ramsgate.” The

Queen resided in Ramsgate. The oldest inhabitants can
point out the Royal Residence, and an inscription is, we
believe, still extant on the little dairy whence was brought
every morning the fresh milk for the Duchess's and the
Princess VICTORIA's early breakfast. And now is “Royal
Ramsgate” to be left out in the cold, while Margate is
honoured with an invitation to the Coronation? Oh, too

THACKERAY's satire, as there is in all good satire. It is the

LORD's indictment might be urged with equal reason-or
unreason-against ARISTOPHANES, JUVENAL, SWIFT, POPE, and

indicate sufficiently that Mr. LORD has his faults as a critic
-though he is a very clever man.
Cecil Rhodes (BLACKWOOD), by HOWARD HENSMAN, is a some-
what matter-of-fact narrative of one of the most notable
careers of the nineteenth century. It is written from the
outside point of view, containing none of those touches
possible only to a biographer who has studied his subject
from intimate personal acquaintance. Happily the topic is
so fascinating, the points of interest so wide, that even work
frankly done on this plan cannot fail to be attractive. To
a considerable extent the book is a record of the later history
of South Africa. There are several illustrations, including
a pretty picture of Groot Schuur, Mr. RHODES's residence
near Cape Town. My Baronite sees again the spacious
stoep where, far into nights of South African summer, he
has sat listening to CECIL RHODES talking—not about gold
or diamonds, or even a trunk line of rail from Cape Town to
Cairo, but of English literature in the reign of Queen ANNE
and the statecraft that marked the makers and rulers of the
early Roman Empire.

Gorgeous Stranger. "I SAY, HUNTSMAN, WOULD YOU MIND BLOWING YOUR HORN TWO OR THREE TIMES? I WANT MY FELLOW, WHO
HAS MY FLASK, TO KNOW WHERE WE ARE, DON'T YOU KNOW !"
ON SATURDAY MORNING EARLY.
On Saturday next at half-past eight-
I mustn't be half a second late-
I'm going out at the garden gate
When the dew is glittery-pearly.
I'm going, I'm going, I don't know where,
But I think I shall find some others there,
On Saturday next if the sun shines fair,
On Saturday morning early.
Perhaps it's the home of the big tom-tit,
Or the land where the little blue fairies flit,
For Daddy he said I should visit it,
And go for a treat alone, too,
In a marvellous carriage with golden springs,
And six white horses with twelve white wings,
And a coachman all over curls and things,
And a footman all of my own, too.
Or perhaps I shall go to the doll-country,
Where the dollies are all as big as me,
And all have raspberry jam for tea,
With huge thick slices of some cake :
It might be sponge, or it might be bright
With cherries, and iced as smooth and white
As the pond when the feathery snow falls light,
Or it might be, possibly, plum-cake.
What fun it 'll be to see Boy Blue,
And Jack and the stalk that grew and grew,
And Puss in Boots and his Marquis too,
And giants and giantesses;
And wonderful gleaming golden towns,
And Kings with sceptres and swords and crowns,
And Queens with fur on their satin gowns,
And beautiful young Princesses !
And if I should see Red Riding Hood
And her grandmamma in the dark old wood,
I shall run away, as a good girl should,
For fear that a wolf might meet her.
But grandmamma will perhaps explain
If teeth, when they bite you, give you pain,
And how she ever got out again
When the wolf had managed to eat her.
And, oh, I shall find where the roses go,
And the golden crocuses all aglow,
And where the little white daisies grow
When they vanish away together;
And the place where the pretty blue-bells stay,
And the pinks and the tulips bright and gay,
When they go away and “Goodbye,” they say,
“Goodbye for the winter weather."
I must take my funny dog Buff, the Skye,
With his little short legs and his ears cocked high,
And his long rough hair, and his hidden eye,
And his face like a great grey pansy.
Doll JANE I shall leave on the nursery floor,
For she doesn't go travelling any more :
Since her head got squeezed in the bedroom door
There's not very much she can see.
So I'm ready, I'm ready! I've packed some socks,
A bonnet, a bib, and two holland frocks,
And a pair of shoes in a brand-new box ;
And I've given my Mummy warning.
I shall take a mug and a fork and spoon,
And the musical box that plays one tune,
And I'll hurry away—but I'll come back soon-
On Saturday next in the morning.

It was on a fine spring evening in the
year 1903 that Mr. Punch's Represen-
tative made his way to the Coliseum
Theatre, intent on seeing The Emperor's
Elbou, a new and successful comedy.
Arriving, with his wonted punctuality,
some ten minutes before the time when
the curtain was announced to rise, our

of attendants, each of whom wore a

“One moment, Sir,” said the official
in the box-office; “ you cannot enter

“What--what in the world has that

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Can you allow me
space wherein to prove, what has long
been suspected by Baconians, that the
plays attributed to Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPS
were really written by Lord Chancellor
HALSBURY? The chain of evidence runs
thus:
1. Lord HALSBURY, Lord Chancellor :
ef. Lord BACON.
2. STEPHEN PHILLIPS, self-styled drama-
tist and ex-actor : cf. WILLIAM SHAK-
SPEARE.
3. The ingrained tendency of Lord
Chancellors to write other people's
plays.
4. The antecedent improbability that
Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPS, who for six years
mixed with none but travelling actors,
and then (see JOHN LANE's biography)
became an army coach, should have
acquired that knowledge of kings,

Our friends, perhaps, cannot understand why we are thus

if we do they fall away from us and we are left alone with
our grief. Thrice happy, indeed, if even the gift of solitude

But this leaves our original question still unanswered.
Why do Humble-bees not live in hives? Those who have
read my earlier work on the Bee will feel no surprise on
learning that it is from the loftiest motives. There is in
the honey of the Humble-bee something poisonous, some-
thing inimical to man. I have known many in whom it
causes headache and dizziness. It follows, therefore, that
the Humble-bee will not dwell in man's hives because her
honey disagrees with him.

order that she might go to a Concentration Camp,
alleging that she did not see why she should
work for a living when in such a camp she would
be well looked after and have nothing to do but
enjoy herself.”)

I'll take Boer leave to-day—you see

When all my meisje-friends take care
To go where they 'll be happy ?.

Where like a lady I shall live
With all my wishes heeded !

A year or more I'd stay for;

At the monthly meeting of nursery
imps held the other evening in the toy
district of Kiddy-minster, the painful
story of Old Mother Hubbard and her
Dog was discussed in all its bearings by
the members.
She had no business (urged a prim-
rose-coloured doll) to have neglected
keeping an account of the impoverished
condition of the cupboard. He blamed
her severely for her want of forethought
and preparation. Not being related to
her in any way he could only speak as
an outside critic of her domestic abilities,
and these, he thought, sadly lacked

THE GREAT BUN COMBINE.
Sensational Offers.
ENGLAND V. AMERICA.
THE great Bun war has begun. The
Anglo-Saxon Bun Combine (American
capital and British labour) has taken up
the challenge flung down by the Imperial
Bun Combine (British capital and
British labour). The Imperial Combine
has presented every baker in the United
Kingdom with a diamond ring. The
Anglo-Saxon Combine has countered by
offering a bonus of a small motor-car
for each Anglo-Saxon bun sold.
EPISODES OF THE CAMPAIGN.
Great interest is being taken at
Ballykilbeg in the fierce contest now
proceeding between the rival Combines
for the trade of Mrs. BRIDGET MALONEY.
Mrs. MALONEY has already received a
grand piano, a herd of swine, two
Regent Street costumes, and three sacks
of potatoes, but is still wavering between
the two Combines. She sells between
two and three dozen buns a week, and
at present divides her orders. At the
time of wiring there is an unconfirmed
report that in consideration of a life
annuity of £300 Mrs. MALONEY has
decided to give her adhesion to the
Anglo-Saxon Combine. It is rumoured
also that she has expressed her intention
of retiring from the cares of the bakery
business.
The Imperial Combine has offered to
present six battle-ships to the Govern-
ment conditionally on Imperial buns
only being used at the House of
Commons refreshment bars. To secure
the same privilege the Anglo-Saxon
Combine has offered either to pay off
the National Debt or to bear the expense
of cleaning Ludgate Hill Station. It is
said in Parliamentary circles that if the

HINTS TO PUBLIC SPEAKERS.
II. -
As a second exercise in the art of
oratory, you cannot do better than
imitate the classic style of Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT. And, if you are really anxious
to make progress, mind that you neglect
no opportunity of practising your art.
The difficulty of collecting an audience
can easily be overcome if you use your
chances properly. For example, let us
suppose that you attend the annual
meeting of your club. The accounts
are passed and the routine business run
through with almost indecent haste. At
the end there is a slight pause. The
Secretary catches your eye and nods.
You know what he wants, and your
natural inclination is merely to murmur
“Beg to propose vote of thanks to the
Chair.” This would be quite wrong;
it would be throwing away an excellent
opportunity for making a speech.
Instead, you will rise from your seat,
advance to the Secretary's table--which
you must thump emphatically at the
end of every sentence--and begin as
follows:
"In the course of a somewhat pro-
tracted existence, Mr. Chairman, seldom
or never have I approached a task in
any measure analogous to that which at
this moment lies before me with so
strong, and, I may add, so overpowering
a sense of indignation. (At this point
your audience will open their eyes. It
may be that I am the victim of some
error, it may be that the duty of listen-

present is that supporters of Mr. Soort are on the wrong
tack. When the moment is ripe the author's agent, my
good friend and colleague, Mr. A. PINKER Watt, will doubt-
less make the disclosure. I understand that the competition
for the author's next work is very keen, and many American
publishers—with a zeal for lucre which in others I cannot
too cordially deprecate--are on their way across the Atlantic
to secure the American rights, and my Christian friend,
Major POND, is also coming in the hope of booking some
lectures from the Great Unknown, as well as from the Duke
of WELLINGTON and the Regent.
From the “Daily Mail” of 2002 A.D. (a preprint).
March 31.
We have good reason to believe that an ultimatum has
been addressed to this Government by that of Monaco. War
is always a serious, a terrible thing, but we unhesitatingly
say that if the Ministry keep a bold front they will have
the entire country at their back. What we have written we
have written.
April 1.
The situation still remains acute, but we earnestly trust
that the Government will think twice, nay ten times, before
they plunge the country into a bloody war with so wealthy,
so well-equipped, and so warlike a nation as that of Monaco.
It is true that in numbers we have a slight superiority, but
the Prince has the fastest aerial automobile in the world,

"OH, MARY, GO AND FETCH THE SUPPER BEER.”
(A piece of corrected Kingsley.)
“Oh, Mary, go and fetch the supper beer,
And fetch the supper beer,
And fetch the supper beer,
Across the Strand for me!”
The pirate buses came from far and near,
And all alone went she.
The beastly fog came down upon the Strand,
And o'er and o'er the Strand,
And round and round the Strand;
As far as eye could see,
The blinding fog came down and hid the land,
And never home came she.
Oh, what can be the meaning of the crowd--
The eager peering crowd,
The roughly jostling crowd-
A broken jug to see?
Was never maiden yet that swore so loud,
Nor half so long as she.
For language such as this they ran her in,
To Bow Street ran her in,
To Bow Street ran her in,
And fourteen days did she.
Still cabmen see her fetch the surper beer,
Though not-no! not for me.

'Tis Spring-time! From the alley dark,
Where sunshine never enters, hark !
That hapless prisoner, the lark,
Pours forth his sweet wild carol;
A maddening thought within him stirs
Of hill-tops where the windmill whirs,
And breezy downs of golden furze
In April's brave apparel.
So, too, through windows dim and dun,
The prisoned clerk beholds the sun
That plays about in frolic fun
On inkpot, desk and ledger ;
Feels the fresh warmth and longs to see
Green field, blue sky and budding tree,
And thinks that it were bliss to be
A ploughman or a hedger.
He hastens home at evening, bent
On garden joys, his shillings spent
On seeds and seedlings, well content
To follow father ADAM ;
And thus, all office cares forgot,
With careful spade and water-pot,
He delves the small suburban plot
Of brick and bare macadam.
“Here, here," thinks he, “the Marshal
Niel
Her orange glory shall reveal ;
A crimson rambler here shall steal,
And here shall bloom tea-roses :
Upon this porch, now black with grime,
Shall sweetest honeysuckle climb
To mingle fragrance with the thyme
When evening softly closes."
But what does sweet returning Spring
The poor imprisoned songster bring?
A turf whereon to beat the wing

before, but having a low opinion of
humanity in general I was charitable
enough to think that other people's
friends were just as bad. Of late, how-

that other people have friends who are
kindly, sympathetic and helpful, and
that my friends stand alone in their

brutality. Therefore I have determined
to expose them.

THE KING'S CRUISE.

Mount St. Michael, the home of the St. AURYNS,
whose head, Lord St. LEVAN, went to meet the
King in his family barge. His Majesty subse-

The King sat on the rocky steep
That looks o'er sea-born Marazion,

Which ARTHUR once lived high and

Dimly he scanned the dancing bay,
Vaguely reviewed the vault of Heaven,
Or, in a listless, pensive way,
Addressed remarks to Lord Sr. LEVAN.
What is it corrugates his brows,
And turns his wonted smile so chilly ?
Why was he so distrait at Cowes,
So absent-minded down in Scilly?
Why does he skirt the Duchy's marge
Blind to the bunting's gay vermilion,
Or look as though St. Aubyn's barge
Had come to take him to Avilion ?
What means it? Is he then the thrall
Of cares attached to kingly stations,
Ever immense and most of all
Upon the eve of Coronations ?
Does he in some dark nightmare move,
A prey to incorporeal fancies,
Fearing the Abbey's pile will prove
Unequal to the circumstances ?
I dare not probe the Monarch's mood,
Or trust to second-hand recitals;
But I am told he tends to brood
Over the task of giving titles;
If so, I let my pity loose

As to be almost suffocating!

I watch its glorious charms unfolding,
And revel in the joys they bring
Once more, for my bebolding !
The first clear note the cuckoo calls,
The nightingale's first tuneful|

Upon my ear their accent falls,
To new-waked rapture thrilling.
The daffodilly's primal burst,
The violet's initial splendour,
To each, while each is still the first,
My homage I must render.
Thus, every Spring's new-kindled fire
Has to my noble passion pandered,
And brought fresh records to inspire
My letter to the Standard.

"A GREAT OPPORTUNITY!”
A CORRESPONDENT writes :--"I enclose
the following item of political news from
the Westminster Gazette of April 8th :-
"As to the new Liberal League, Mr. Lawson
Walton said ... “ They need not be such official
ticklers as to denounce this form of assistance
They should welcome it and wish it ‘God-speed.'”
(Applause.)'
“Can you tell me what is the func-

Not hers the secret of the Powers
For keeping China whole !
Her shocking treatment of the twins
I shall not soon forget ;
Lo! the memento of her sins-
A broken bassinet !
She answered only side - door
calls,
Her manners were so blunt;
For none but polished “ generals"
Can answer at the “ front”!
Yet why recite the faults of her ?
The hateful task I shun,
And since she has no “character "
I mean to give her one.
The plea of pity shall I spurn,
And send her forth forlorn ?
Ah, no; --- 'tis someone else's

To bear what I have borne !

ACTORS AT BOW STREET.
At the termination of the special
literary session at this Court, reports of
which have appeared in Punch, a
dramatic session was held. The magis-
trates on the bench were Sir SQUIRE
BANCROFT, Mr. W. S. GILBERT, Mr.
CLEMENT Scott, and Mr. JOSEPH KNIGHT.
The following cases were disposed of :
CHARLES WARNER, (004 Gerrard) was
charged with installing and using a
telephone with too much license, on the
stage of Wyndham’s Theatre.
Sir ROBERT HUNTER, who appeared on
behalf of the Post Office, stated that
Mr. WARNER's action was a distinct
infringement of the settlement recently
arrived at between the Government and
the National Telephone Company, in that
while an unlimited user he had paid
neither the flat nor the toll rate. He
understood, however, that the offence
had been recently discontinued ; and he
would therefore be satisfied with a
severe reprimand.
Sir HENRY FOWLER, who gave evidence
on behalf of the National Telephone
Company, deposed that the interests of
that concern were seriously prejudiced
by Mr. WARNER'S action. Neurotic
persons abstained from subscribing on
the ground that if murder could be
heard through a telephone, infection
could be communicated. Besides, Mr.
WARNER's method of using the telephone
was highly improper. Telephone clerks
had already begun to imitate his
stentorian tones, and even his gestures,
to the utter disorganisation of the
exchanges and the fracture of several
diaphragms. Many of the wires had
corkscrewed under the stress.
At this stage of the proceedings a
loud hissing was heard in Court, which
the Bench threatened to have cleared,
until it was explained by the Usher
that it proceeded from the rapid trans-
mission of the letter S from Signor

He indignantly denied that murder had
been committed. The evidence was was prosecuted by the Royal Humane a free country, and, as he was the

THE ROAD TO THE WOOLSACK.
It is now my pleasing duty to con-
clude this series of contributions to the
leading forensic journal. I promised
to teach the student how to attain the
dignity of the Lord High Chancel-
lorship in a single lesson.
Of course it would be better if he
commenced his career as the younger
son of a Duke. But this is not abso-
lutely essential to success. As a mem-
ber of the Bar it may be taken for
granted that he is a gentleman, or at
least the heir to a millionaire. It is
advisable that after being well
grounded in some excellent dame's
school) he should enter one of the
public schools of Royal foundation,
preferably Eton or Winchester. If the
younger son of a Duke, he may extend
the list to Harrow, Westminster, Shrews-
bury, Rugby, Marlborough, Cheltenham,
Radley, St. Paul's and Felsted.
He should go either to Christchurch
or Balliol, Oxford, or Trinity, Cam-
bridge. If the younger son of a
Duke, he might venture a term or two
at Durham or Dublin. But this little
excursion must not stand in his way so
as to preclude a double-first or a Senior
Wranglership.
When he leaves the University (if he
is a graduate of the colleges to which I
have referred, he will never call his
alma mater “the 'Varsity '') he may pos-
sibly find my poor suggestions service-
able in his selection of his Inn of Court
and other matters connected therewith.
He will certainly join the Inns of
Court Volunteers. When on outpost
duty he will be careful not to betray
the countersign to even the dearest and
nearest of his colleagues, but will, if |
necessary, arrest him, and this, with
further attention to his military duties,

out.”
But Vūlliămỹ's sharp enough to make excuse
That for an extra “i” he has no use.
Two are enough for him, he's young at fifty,
Has made a fortune, somehow, being thrifty ;
He lives, en garçon, and good Mrs. Clemson,
Carrying tablets which she makes her “mems." on,
Acts as his housekeeper; Miss MEASOR plays her
So well, 'tis difficult to overpraise her.
His friend and neighbour is the Earl of Farnham
(A name pronounced as if it rhymed with BANNUM),
A country gentleman, an English type,
Who of good wine has cellar'd many a pipe.
As Mister ALFRED BISHOP plays the part,
His geniality wins every heart.
Sir Edward—is he bachelor or widower ?
No. There's a wife. But how did he get rid o'
her ?
He didn't. She's alive. Across the water
There's also (unbeknown to him) a daughter,
Who calls herself “Miss Murray,” and this looks
As if she published, -oh, no-she writes, books.
She knows a lot, but, though so wise, is rather
Puzzled to know who was, and is, her father.
She, talking to Sir Edward, from her pocket
Produces a peculiar sort of locket
(You know what 's coming now; the old, old, thing),
* Hall-strawberry-mark'd,” a “locket”-and “a ring,”
Which, when Sir Edward, in great agitation,
Beholds, he grasps at once the situation,
Also the locket, and to Lady Bab
(Miss Mary MOORE) he hoarsely murmurs, “ Cab!-
Brougham--coach-anything-I'm off to Paris
At once, to find out where Miss Murray's ‘Mar' is!
Don't ask me why, it is in her behoof
And that of all concerned. I must have proof!”
Then gentle Lady Barbara O'Hagan
(To worship MARY MOORE one would turn pagan !)
Bids him “adieu” pro tem. Ends second act.

And speak like natives, in the liveliest tones,
As in the latest play by ARTHUR JONES
Do his chief actors. Now then, who comes here?
Sir Eduard first; then Mistress BERNARD BEERE,
As Madame Sumont, elegantly dressed,
Looking and acting at her very best,
Makes it as clear as day (this scene is good)
That Eleanor, Miss Murray, has the blood
Of our Sir Edward in her dainty veins,
Which, to explain, she, Madame, takes great pains,
So as to give him every facility
For calculating on the probability
Of her connected tale. (And yet the hearer
Would like the matter made a trifle clearer,
For, if she owns to having “ done her worst,"
Mayn't she have been a wrong ’un from the first ?)

And Madame drowns her sorrows in the Seine.

And then, as every intellectual chap sees
ANTICIPATIONS.
(With suitable apologies to Mr. H. G. Wells.)
An esteemed London daily paper has explained that it
was necessary to continue the Association football match at
Govan after the accident which cost twenty people their lives
because “it would probably not have been safe to disappoint
the crowd !” This extreme sensitiveness on the part of our
athletic crowds to anything which interrupts their amuse-
ment may be expected to increase rather than diminish with
time. Thus, in the year 1950 or so, the following para-
graphs will probably figure in the sporting columns of our
contemporary :-
At St. Andrews, in the monthly golf contest, Mr. McTavish
unaccountably foozzled his drive on three successive occa-
sions. A spectator was so disgusted at this exhibition of
incompetence that he broke four of McTavish's ribs.
The County cricket match between Dorsetshire and
Rutland at Oakham, yesterday, was the occasion of some
grand scoring. An unusual incident occurred in the course
of the afternoon. The Rutland captain was giving a fine
display of batting, and as his side had secured a long lead
he was considering the propriety of declaring his innings
closed. It was, however, pointed out to him that it would
be unsafe to disappoint the crowd which was evidently
enjoying his hard hitting. He is, therefore, batting still.
In the lawn tennis tournament at Wimbledon on Tuesday,
the amateur champion twisted his ankle early in the game
and had to retire hurt. The public were thus cheated
of what would have been an exciting struggle, and relieved
their exasperation by hooting him as he limped to the
pavilion.
In the great billiard match at the Olympian Hall yester-
day a curious affair is reported. It was an all-in game, and
one of the players had made thirty successive spot strokes.
The spectators naturally grew weary of this tiresome method
of play, and one of them struck the player violently behind
as he was making his thirty-first stroke. This effectually
prevented the continuance of such tedious tactics.
Great precautions are to be taken to secure the safety of
the crews at this year's boat race. Last year, it may be
remembered, the losing crew, who came in thirty lengths
behind, were seized by the indignant crowd as they left their
boat, and narrowly escaped drowning. This year the banks of
the river at the winning-post will be guarded by cavalry,
and a Maxim gun will be mounted at the "Ship” at
Mortlake. It is hoped that the contest will be conducted
without serious loss of life.
The final for the ping-pong championship at the Queen's
Hall concluded yesterday amid scenes of great excitement.
Smith and BROWN, the unsuccessful pair, showed up very
badly towards the end of the contest, and altogether gave
such a poor display of the game that after it was over they
had to be escorted from the building under police protec-
tion.

MRS. LANGTRY and the whole company
recently performing in Mle. Mars at
the Imperial Theatre, were prosecuted
by the Society for the Protection of
Immigrants for cruelty to the French
language.
Mr. Å. B. WALKLEY, dramatic critic of
the Times, speaking as usual in broken
English, said that the pronunciation of
the performers at the Théâtre Impérial
was more assommant than anything at
which he had ever assisted.
Mr. H. G. WELLS said that he was
familiar with Mars. There was no
reason why good French should be
expected from anyone connected with
it, whether Mademoiselle or Madame.
His own experience of Martian dialogue
was a prolonged ululation.
M. Paul CAMBON, French ambassador
at the Court of St. James's, stated that
he had attended a performance of Mlle.
Mars. He was not aware that any
French was spoken in the play.
Mrs. LANGTRY, in her defence, reminded
the Bench that she was a native of
Jersey, where they spoke a patois. She
had, however, spared no expense in
providing every member of her company
with a copy of Hugo's French Journal
and Ollendorff's Dialogues.
On Mrs. LANGTRY undertaking to de-
sist from these courses, and to revive the
company's native powers of attraction

O GIVE me not the soldier's lot
With marches hot and dusty,
Nor let me, like a lawyer, rot
Mid parchments old and musty;
Nor bid me seek the City, where,
From morn till evening, anxious care
Still haggles over stock and share
In chambers foul and fusty.
But let me keep my study snug,
On downy couch reclining,
While Ponto slumbers on the rug,
And sweetly dreams of dining.
There let me bask before the fire
And watch the cloudlets leave my briar,
Like fragrant incense floating higher,
In circles intertwining.
And close within my easy reach
May poets, wits and sages
Be gathered on my shelves to teach
The wisdom of the ages ;

“THE GERMAN HOOD’
ENTERTAINMENT.”
CAPTAIN BASIL Hood having chosen
the Elizabethan period for the story of
his opera at the Savoy Theatre—a story
which only by extreme courtesy could be
possibly dignified by being described
as a "plot"-has apparently done his
utmost to bring his dialogue “ back to
date” and to flavour it as strongly
as possible with sixteenth-century
"English as she was spoke” in the
time of ELIZABETH.
Aye, marry, and hath not Master BASIL
HOOD, “captain ” by your leave, my
masters, deftly done his self-appointed
task? Hath he not caught the very
trick of Will SHAKSPEARE'S quips,
cranks, and quiddities? Doth he not
speak of a doctor as “a leech," and
of a larky young woman as a “ wild
wench”? Doth he not show us the
"humours” of Pistol, and the stolid
drollery of the clownish grave-digger ?
Go to! Hath he not glibly his

full of quaint Elizabethan conceits, and
among the quaintest is a kind of
twentieth-century topical song sung
by Master Wilkins, a player who turns
his back on Her Gracious Majesty,
which is "an insult to her very face,"
as our Waggish-William-Shakspearian
librettist would express it.
Evidently Captain Hood, who may be
credited with having studied the sub-
ject for the purposes of this libretto,
does not hold the humour of these
Elizabethan players, nor the wit either
of Sir WALTER RALEIGH or of the Earl of
Essex, in very high esteem. But let

rather risky plays or too frisky adaptations, may be honestly
recommended to the “nobility, gentry and clergy” of Merrie
England, married and single, and to their wives, families,
and guileless children, as a piece no less singularly void of
offence in dialogue than innocent of plot; though which,
such as it is, sufficiently serves the purpose of the gallant

Old England long since disappointed her backers,
And lowered her colours, in sign of defeat,
At the contest of ARMOUR- the Cannae of meat.

The Yankees advance their victorious banners,
Till at last they are able to utter the boast
That they mean to be ruling Britannia's roast.

A. T. Jones, of Leeds, " from information received ” (by the

authorities. Here's a lucky combination! A Constable
and a Moreland !

A WEIGHTY REASON.

Messrs. TORRENCE and CROMPTON, who are as Gog and Magog
among the foresters, all praise is due. There is a party of
Shakspearian clowns, a butcher, a baker, a tinker, å tailor,
played by Messrs. PINDER, BODDY, LEwis and Rous, who are
own brothers to Quince the bellows mender and the rest of
the dramatis personce in the amateur theatrical company of
which Bottom was the “ leading man.”
All the ladies of the Savoy are pretty, just as “ no one,”
according to Mr. Cyrus Bantam, was “fat or old in Ba-ath,"
and all sweet singers; Miss AGNES FRASER, fascinating as
Bessie (oh, the humorous originality of calling her Bessie, so
as to create some cause of jealousy 'twixt Queen Bess and
her!); Miss POUNDS, charming as “ Jill-All-Alone” (so Eliza-
bethan too!); and Miss KEDDIE, an ideal “May Queen.”'
Who better than Miss Rosina BRANDRAM could represent
the Maiden Monarch? She is the Last of the Savoyards,
and, had she only been limited to posing at the back of the
stage on the barge, with the full glare of the glorious lime-
light on her gorgeous costume and brilliant wig, she would
ever have remained in my memory as does the figure of Mrs.
SELBY (playing the same character, assuming the same pose,
and arriving in the same manner, only she came by penny
steamboat) in the once famous burlesque of Kenilworth, in the
“good old Elizabethan” days of the little Strand Theatre.
The principal dancer, Miss WINIFRED HART DYKE, is one of
the most graceful, most spirited and inspiriting of danseuses
I have seen for a long time, and richly did she deserve the
thoroughly hearty encore.

ROSABACCA, described as the off-leader
in the winning chariot at Ben-Hur, and
therefore the principal actor, was, at
the instigation of the Jockey Club,
charged with boring at Drury Lane.
Mr. JAMES LOWTHER, on behalf of the
Jockey Club, said he had visited
Drury Lane. Certainly the horse bored.
Cross-examined, he admitted that every-
one else in the play did so too.
Mr. ARTHUR COVENTRY supported the
last witness. Never in his experience
had he seen a more flagrant case of
boring.
M. CHIFNEY, of the Calmady Stables,
denied that the horse bored. Cross-
examined, he allowed that his judgment
was perhaps impaired by the hectic and
sensational environment in which he
had lived at Brockhurst.
General LEW WALLACE, the author of
the book from which the play Ben-Hur
had been adapted, stated that it was
never his intention that a horse should
be looked upon as the principal charac-
ter. He could not, however, be held
responsible for the vagaries of play-
goers' taste. When the book left his
hands, many years ago, it was a
religious romance. On cross-examina-
tion, he confessed that the principle of
"cutting the cackle and coming to the
'osses” was a good one. A play had
better go to the 'osses than the dogs.
(Applause in Court.)
Messrs. KLAW and BEN-HURLANGER,
who present the play, and who were
sworn together, speaking in strong
nasal unison, denied that the horse
bored, but if he did it was because he
was a pro-bore and couldn't help it.

Polo and Frank Chester. On discover-
ing his unhappy mistake he demanded
the return of his money, and, this being
refused, he had caused the present
action to be brought.
Various experts were called by the
prosecution to prove that the play
Paola and Francesca might be better
worth half-a-guinea.
Mr. CLYDE FLITCH, of Dunmow, the
author' of Sapho, who gave his evidence
in American, said that he might not be
as great as Bacon, but he would have
treated the subject very differently.
What it wanted was some first-class
transatlantic adaptation.
Captain Basil Hoon, author of Merrie
Germanie, said that the real need was
a good patter song for the tyrant of
Rimini (which had been rhymed before,
and might be rhymed again, to niminy
piminy). Also more comic relief and a
dance or so.
Mr. GEORGE R. Sims, whose glossy
raven mane streamed down his shoulders,
stated that the title was bad. What
did English people care about Paolo and
Francesca ? “On the Rimini Razzle-
Dazzle,” would do better, or “ The
Italian Warehouse Lights.”

THE HORRORS OF PEACE.
(A Foreboding of Dr. Leyds.)
What is this strange, unearthly fear
That weighs me down like lead ?
Why do I wake and rudely shake
In my well-appointed bed,
And feel a horrible bogey form
Come gibbering round my head ?
Like to a sleepless sentinel
It keeps its nightly post,
Of all known things that go on wings
Abhorred by me the most ;
It is the so-called Angel, Peace!
She is that horrid ghost.
In vain I rise and look towards
The unresponsive stars,
Or don my hose and so compose
A column of pungent pars
Alleging that I have lately had
A message sent from Mars.
I try the pulse of Europe's heart
And like it less and less ;
And when I count the gross amount
I've squandered on the Press
I often feel that I have missed
Unqualified success.
Even my trusty Little Blue
Begins to harbour doubt ;
Already faint suspicions taint
That azure Brussels sprout;
It hints that my supreme advice
Is being done without !
And when I answer, “ Entre nous,
You find me cornered tight;
I have no news of BURGER's views,
He cannot wire or write; ”.
“Just so," the editor replies,
“But would he, if he might?”.
Ah! what a change since round my path

AN UNEXPECTED RIDE.

night, and discussed our coming Point-

think it rather heroic to ride in one. I
smiled indulgently and assured him it
was merely like fast hunting run.
“Well, you try it,” said SPILLER, rather
nettled ; "I did once, and found it
rather nervous work.” Smiled again.
SPILLER poor horseman. I mean com-

tried to shame him into riding by
saying, “If I only had your chestnut
mare, SPILLER, I'd soon show them the
way along!” “Then I 'll enter her, and
you shall ride!” he said. Enthusiastic
creature, SPILLER. Of course I was
awfully glad—at least, I fancy so. Now
that I come to think of it, that chestnut
mare has awfully bad shoulders, and
also pulls pretty hard. Wonder if
she's quite safe at her fences ?

[“So far as smart society is concerned, authors
are lions no longer. Roar they never so loudly, not
a soul shudders. Authors have themselves to
blame. Their first mistake was committed in
accepting Society's invitations and attending func-
tions in short hair and conventional attire. Their
second consisted in talking the epigram to death;
but the fatal error was the illustrated interview.
Familiarity breeds contempt-even for ions.
Authors now entertain each other; and, badii hed

On the completion of the hearing of
the cases against various actors, recently
reported in Mr. Punch's columns, the
Bench was re-organised to hear certain
artistic cases, the magistrates being
Lord ROTHSCHILD, Sir THOMAS LIPTON.
Mr. SPIELMANN, Mr. HUMPHRY WARD, and
the Editor of the Tailor and Cutter.
The Hon. JOHN COLLIER was prose-
cuted by the Medical Officer of Health
for Piccadilly for failing to notify an
infectious case which had occurred in
Room 5, Burlington House.
Dr. TIBBLES, the eminent bacteriolo-
gist, who appeared on behalf of the
Local Government Board, stated that
as the result of careful examination he
was obliged to admit that, while the
gentleman in the corner was taking
all reasonable precautions, he was
quite unable to state whether the
patient was suffering from stage fright,
cholera, or plague. In any case Mr.
COLLIER's action was most reprehensible.

“But then, of course," adds the man
in the bowler, “ that's wot you ain't.”
The young man adopts a policy of silent
indifference, and gazes at St. George's

"Two bob I bet with yer that this

the bowler.
The young man says nothing.
“Bettin' à gentleman two bob,”

The young man still gazes at the

“Swellin' abaht bettin' gentlemen

don't want yer bloomin' two bob,” he
adds. “When I bets two bobs I bets

The young man produces a cigarette,
and lights it self-consciously.

bestows much care on his cigarette.
The man in the bowler, having dis-
covered this effective epigram, harps on

Locked together, the three sway from

then drives stolidly on with hunched

and, stopping the bus, by some unerring
instinct extricates the still bowlered
man from the trio, and persuades him
somehow to descend the steps.
The bell rings, and the bus moves on
again. The cavalryman helps the
young man to find his hat, and peace
is once again restored.
After a time the young man begins
to rummage under the seats. The
cavalryman has again gone to sleep.
The man in the greasy cap in front of

TROP DE ZÈLE.
At Cambridge, Mr. E. G. BROWNE, University
Lecturer in Persian, has recently been elected to
the Professorship of Arabic. In addition to these
languages, “Mr. BROWNE," says the Cambridge
Review, "has acquired an extensive knowledge of
Turkish. This last circumstance seems, ndaly
enough, to have been urged as a positive disqualifica-
tion by at least one eminent member of the Senate,
when it was proposed to make Mr. BROWNE a
University Lecturer.")
It is clear that at least one eminent
member of the Cambridge Senate is
prepared to grapple with the educa-
tional problem. A time will no doubt
come when the matter of disqualifica-
tions will be treated as seriously as it
deserves, and when a board of inquisitors
will be appointed to look into it. Then
we may expect something like this:

I WANDERED down the cloistered High
At midnight. Solitary I.
No footfall on the flagstones rang,
No reveller belated sang,
No proctor in the shadows prowled,
No nimble-footed bull-dog growled.
Around me, lapped in silence deep,
Lay moonlit colleges asleep.
I paused beneath St. Mary's spire
To mark her gilded vane afire
With fairy-like illumination.
And while I watched, the first vibra-
tion--
The herald of the organ's peal-
Deep in my heart I seemed to feel.
I listened. Slowly swelled the note.
Sweet harmony began to float
In tuneful cadences, and stole
Melodious upon my soul;
And as it mounted high and higher
A silver-voiced angelic choir
Their music raised 'mid arches
groined,
And with the trembling organ joined :
Where shines the light?
Where never cometh night
Blinding the sight
And leaving nothing clear ?
Where doth the ray
Of knowledge shine alway,
Making night day?-
You ask where shines it?-Here!

niece, the aforesaid saintly Elizabeth, has suddenly returned
to his own again while yet the smell of the varnish is some-
what powerful.
Fortunately there is a good deal of open air space in this
magnificent establishment, which at all times must be a
trifle draughty; and this fact will probably account for a
certain throatiness distinctly perceptible in the singers of
that concerted piece in Act II., which, beginning with a
single “number," swells gradually, as does a serial story
in a magazine, into a "volume"-of sound.
Among much that is good this season in Tannhäuser,
noticeable and laudable is the performance of Madame
SOBRINO, who takes the audience completely by surprise when
she appears as a shepherd-boy with a pipe in his mouth! Most
realistic! She played both the little part and the little pipe
charmingly. Whether the pastoral pipe was meerschaum,
hriar-root, or clay, it was, at a distance, difficult to determine,
but anyway it was a very sweet pipe, artistically coloured,
one that requires no "puffing” from anybody, least of all
from Madame SOBRINO herself, who played at playing it, for,
of course, like children amusing theinselyes, she was “ only

come,” so in melody-drama we may hope that a time, and a
tune, will arrive when, put a Penny-rini in the slot and he
will come out as a prize Master-singer. Madame NORDICA as

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PALATIAL ENTERTAINMENT.
“Morning and night the miller thrives," as Grindolf, the
accomplished scoundrel, used to remark in the ancient musical
melodrama of The Miller and his Men, which, changing
Miller into Morton, CHARLES MORTON, and coupling with his
name the Palace of Varieties, might well be applied to this
experienced manager and the house of entertainment over
which he presides. At the present time, and there is no
time like the present, Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER, with his clever
variety troupe, is giving his musical and dramatic sketches ;
his impersonations show him to have brought to perfection
a dramatic power of illustration, in which art there is no one
within measurable distance of him. All his items are good
-some better than others; but, while most persons coming
to be entertained do not object to shedding the silent tear
(generally followed by blowing the resounding nose), they
do object to too great a strain being made upon their finer
feelings. As Mr. Guppy observed, “There are chords,"
and admiring immensely the power of pathos that Mr.
CHEVALIER can exert so deftly, we shall be with the “ vast
majority,” who dearly love a laugh, in reminding Mr.
CHEVALIER that a little sentiment goes a long way, and that
what his audience, when recurring to the entertainment,
would always like to be able to exclaim is, “ Laugh, lor',
we thought we should ha' died !”
A COCK AND BEAR STORY.
M. Loubet on the Duplice.
If in reply to your so flattering toast
France in my humble person here adopts
The eager attitude of love at sight,
Let not Imperial Majesty assume
I have so short a memory for facts
As not to recognise each polished phrase
Uttered identically in my ears
I dare not say how many times before.
And when I too in much the same old terms
Comment upon the military scene
At which we have assisted, you and I-
You on your charger, I upon a chair,
You in your trappings, soldierly equipped,
I in my uniform of evening dress,
St. Andrew's ribbon slung athwart my shirt-
When I dilate on your imposing troops,
Their martial step, their movements so precise,
Recalling vividly that time last year
Which saw your MAJESTY, our honoured guest,
Obligingly review the flower of France-
When I repeat that these fraternal armies
Equally gallant, equally superb,
Provide the usual guarantee of peace--
When I, in short, rehearse those pious views
Which, under pressure, one might take as read,
You in your turn will recognise, I trust,
That I have not disturbed our status quo
By the interpolation of ideas.
Your MAJESTY, I wish to drink the health
Of All the Russias coupled with your name.
Barring the case of England and Japan
I know no combination bound like ours
By ties of Nature, History, Culture, Art,
And absolute community of taste.
The seed of revolution lies in both,
With you more backward, but the soil is right.
We both believe in liberty of speech,
Though here you concentrate it in yourself
While we dispense it round the race at large.
We speak a common language--that of France;
The same ideals animate our breasts ;
And if they travelled, which they never do,
French genii would find themselves at home
In this enlightened land, as yours with us.
But for the trivial accident of birth
TOLSTOY, whom you delight to honour here,
Might have adorned our noble Academe;
And ROCHEFORT, rarest of Parisian scribes,
In some Siberian dungeon might have cooled
His ardour as an independent Pole.
Again, the welcome I receive to-day
Calls back the warm reception Moscow gave
Another Chief of France before my time,
Namely, NAPOLEON. Our glorious flags
Share many proud traditions ; thus, for instance,
On the same field we fought at Inkerman,
While at Fashoda neither fought at all.
Keenly alive to these historic links,
Which supplement the bond of Nature's laws,
Making the bare suggestion of divorce
Unthinkably abhorrent to the mind ;
Nay, giving cause for wonder how it came
That we contrived so long to live apartm
I look towards your MAJESTY, and drink
Deep to its dregs this fiery vodka-draught.
AWFUL POSSIBILITIES.
The Daily Chronicle's special correspondent in Madrid
sent an account of the recent bestowal of the Garter upon
King ALFONSO by the Duke of CoxxAuGHT, which makes
one tremble for the gorgeous ceremonies of next month.
The possibilities of breaches of etiquette loom before one
with awful distinctness. It appears, to quote the Chronicle's
own words, that at the recent investiture :--
“The King was wearing a cadet uniform with long
trousers, which the Duke had failed to notice until after
he had made the presentation speech.”
Trousers! Fancy that, now!--as IBSEN's characters are
always saying. But the appalling results of this state of
things only become clear as the account proceeds. Read on
therefore :--
“It was an awkward moment, the ceremony having to be
interrupted while the King retired to change his uniform
for that of a Commandant of Marines, with knee
breeches.”
It is dreadful to think what might have happened if the
whole august ceremony of investiture had taken place with
the blushing recipient remaining in trousers till the bitter
end. Where on earth would he have put his Garter?
But the story would not be so alarining for Englishmen
at least if they had not in their minds the thought of those
complicated and stately functions next month. What will
happen if at the Coronation, for example, the Hereditary
Prince of DONNER UND BLITZEN turns up with no gold buttons
to his waistcoat, or not enough gold lace on his breeks?
| Will the whole business have to stop while somebody sews
them on? Supposing the Archbishop of CANTERBURY
appears in socks of an uncanonical colour, or the Lord Great
Keeper of the Backstairs sits on his wand and breaks it,
will it invalidate the entire ceremony ?

CRUMBS FOR CRICKETERS.
(How to report a County Match-
Latest Style.)
The Wessex v. Loamshire fixture was
resumed to-day, 5,352 paying for ad-
mission at the turnstiles. The weather
was rather doubtful, and, just before
play began, W. YORKER (known to his
intimates as “PIFFLES ”') was heard to
remark to Bill STUMPS, the famous
Loamshire bat, that he thought there
might be a drop of rain before night.
This version of his utterance, we can
assure our readers, is absolutely correct.
A quite erroneous paraphrase of it
appeared in last night's evening papers.
On an important point like this our
report, as usual, is absolutely trust-
worthy.
Talking of “PIFFLES,” we have ex-
clusive information to the effect that
this splendid cricketer has quite got
over his old dislike of boiled potatoes.
Indeed, he was seen twice to replenish
his plate with this form of the vegetable
during lunch yesterday. He is still faith-
ful to the same brand of tobacco.
As the celebrated ball - propeller,
C. K. SHOOTER, emerged from the
pavilion yesterday, he paused for three
seconds at the gate, and then returned
to the dressing-room to fetch his hand-
kerchief. Our readers doubtless will
remember that a similar startling inci-
dent took place in the Wessex and
M.C.C. match of two seasons ago.
Good old BoB THUMPER urged the
sphere to the boundary fourteen times
in the course of his sparkling innings.
This raises his percentage of boundary
hits to other strokes to 14.6428. So
his last stroke put him ahead of his
rival, Tom SLOGGER, whose percentage
up to date is 14:5873. The crowd was
quick to notice this fact, and greeted his
triumph with tremendous cheering.

CORONATION NOTES.
We have received some very striking
designs for illuminations from the
British Art Decoration Company. One
consists of a row of thirteen gas jets.
Another pretty fancy takes the form of
the numbers 1, 9, 0, 2, placed side by
side, so signifying the year of the
Coronation. But perhaps the most
original of the designs consists of the
King's initials, E. R. These are
arranged in an entirely novel and
striking manner. The clumsy old-
fashioned way was to place them side
by side. The British Art Decoration
Company have hit upon the enterprising
and ingenious idea of placing them one
above the other, thus :-

The effect, as will be seen, is highly artis-
tic and fairy-like, and gives the lie to the
calumny that the British Manufacturer
can never get out of a rut. When once
we put our back into a thing we can
easily keep pace with the foreigner.
Our well-meaning but inartistic fore-
fathers would jump could they but
see how we have advanced in matters of
taste.
Although the price named was a
very considerable one, the King has
felt compelled to decline the offer of
one of the leading American papers to
write an article entitled “How it feels
to be crowned."

Subsequently I had the honour of
escorting the lady through the corridors.
“I suppose you know all the
judges ? ” queried my fair client.
"I have the honour of what may be
termed a nodding acquaintance," was
my reply.
I need scarcely say that my state-
ment was founded on the dignified
courtesy that causes Bench and Bar to
exchange, at the sitting and rising of
the Court, gracious greetings.
“Let us go in here,” suggested my
client, pushing her way into Probate,
Divorce and Admiralty Division No. 1.
I was forced to follow her lead.
The case fortunately was one dealing
with the mysteries of navigation. A
badly-guided steamer had caused the
foundering of a luckless coaler. The
judge, assisted by Trinity Masters, was
trying to discover which batch of wit-
nesses was telling the truth, and which
was guilty of premeditated deception.
The badge of authority placed before
the Court attracted my client's attention.
“What is that?” she asked, point-
ing to the silver symbol.
I explained as well as I could, for my
knowledge on the subject was incom-
plete, the purport of the implement.
“Can't you introduce me to those
nice-looking naral officers ?”
I suggested that, as the Court was
sitting, the action might be considered
as savouring of contempt.
“Well, at least you might let me
know the judge.”
Again I explained the etiquette that

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE..
In the first chapter of An Onlooker's
Note Book (SMITH, ELDER) there shines a
pretty sentence. “To-dav, no one (worth
mentioning) is cocksure." Yet the On-
looker is a bold man, given to discussing
fearlessly the manners and attainments
of other people. Probably even his
searching glance has not discovered in
Mr. GEORGE RUSSELL a tendency to what
Mr. Pigott spelt “ hesitency” to affirm
unfaltering opinion upon passing per-
sons and current events. He has much
to say in his latest commentary, and is
pretty certain of everything. On the
whole, he is disappointed with his
fellow men. Nor does woman please
him either. Our manners have dete-
riorated. Our motives grown meaner.
Over us all is the blight spread by the
South African helot who lives in Park
Lane. Amongst other practices against
which the Onlooker takes up his parable,
is that of “social journalism." By way
'of illustrating his theme he gives us
(for 78. 6d.) 339 pages of social jour-
nalism illumined by moral reflections.
As he observes, à propos of somebody
else's bottes, “well-connected people
have before now written very readable
books.” Such an one is An Onlooker's
Note Book, with its bitter flavour of an
earlier volume called The Book of Snobs.
Apart from the pleasure of seeing
friends and acquaintances pin-pricked,
the book contains many excellent stories
and some facts. Among the latter my
Baronite observes a statement carrying
a step further common knowledge of an
important historical event. Everyone
knows that after the defeat of Mr.

“LA GUERRE DE L'OR.”
M. JEAN COQUELIN has recently produced in Paris at the
Théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, of which his father, M.
COQUELIN AÎNÉ, is the lessee, an anti-English play, by M.
DEBOUT, entitled La Guerre de l'Or. M. DEBOUT is no doubt an
upright man, but his play seems likely to fall very flat.
Before it disappears, we venture to suggest an extra scene,
rather confused and incoherent, with innumerable characters,
so as to resemble the other scenes of the noble drama.
La scène représente la place de Scharing Crosse à Londres.
Au lever du rideau, Lord CHAMBERLAIN est installé sur
un banc, entouré de Lifes Gardes et de policemans. Il
regarde la statue de Sir Nelson.

MR. PUNCH'S NOTES AND
QUERIES.
(A Peep into the Future.)
II.
“Now WE SHAN'T BE LONG” (30th S.
viii. 276).—This historic speech I have
always understood was made by the
Cunard Company at the beginning of
the twentieth century, when asked to
join the Shipping Trust engineered by
the electrician of St. Paul's, Mr. PIER-
PONT MORGAN, who in his spare time
dabbled in finance. Properly written,
the phrase ran “Now we shan't be-
long."
F. L. M.
This saying originated at the be-
ginning of the SALISBURY Ministry of
1900, when Mr. HANBURY succeeded the
Earl of BERKS (then Mr. WALTER Long)
as President of the Board of Agricul-
ture, and, in his determination to
remedy some of the defects of his pre-
decessor, took for the motto of himself
and his colleagues the words, “Now
we shan't be Long.” AERTEX.
RANJI's Hook (30th S. viii. 49). —
This curious phrase, which frequently
occurs in belles lettres circ. ann. 1900,
has hitherto baffled the research of all
inquirers. I was for some time inclined
to attach a geographical signification
to it-cf. “Hook of Holland ”—but am
now disposed to regard this view as un-
tenable. There was undoubtedly an
Oriental potentate of the name of RANJI
associated with the University of Cam-
bridge. In virtue of his royal descent
he was probably a member of King's,
and, if so, was almost certainly educated
at Eton. Now at Eton the term “Dry
Bob” was applied to a certain set of
scholars, presumably in consequence of
their fondness for dry fly fishing (cf.
“Bobbing for dace"). Hence I have
little doubt that “Ranji's hook " was a

(By a thorough Man of Business.)
Build steamers de luxe, replete with
every comfort. Magnificent saloons,
first-class restaurants, exquisite smoke

chef on board, and recruit the officers
and crews from the best material of the
Shipping Combine.
Having secured your fleet, look after
the musical arrangements. Only the
best military bands should be engaged.
These orchestras might be supplemented
by some of the more famous Hungarian
combinations. Sir ALEXANDER MACKENZIE
might be secured at an appropriate
honorarium to act as Harmonious
Managing Director.
During the summer months the fleet
should be illuminated with the finest
devices, and the chief of the firework
manufacturers should control the feu
d'artifice, the end of the night's enter-
tainment.
To render the steamboats more attrac-
tive, morning and evening performances
should be organised with the assistance of
Sir HENRY IRVING, Mr. H. BEERBOHM TREE,
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, and the other
actor-managers of the principal metro-
politan theatres.
This scheme might be carried out
with the friendly assistance of the L.C.C.

“BLOW, BLOW, THOU WINTER WIND!”
In The Times of June 9 is to be found a delightful
account from a correspondent of the sentiments of Mr. Reitz,
late Transvaal Secretary of State, towards English Statesmen.
On being asked, point blank, what he thought of Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN, he is reported to have replied : “I have
nothing to say against Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. He is all right.
He is a statesman, and therefore has a policy which he does
quite right to carry out to the best of his ability. But the
statesmen whom we dislike are Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN,
Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT and Mr. LABOUCHERE. They led us
to believe that they had a real sympathy for our cause, and
we were convinced that they would do their utmost to help
us. They fed us with false hopes, and then we found out
that, instead of having any sympathy for us, they were
simply playing us off for the purpose of getting into power!”
Oh, Mr. Reitz, can I have read aright!
And is it thus our Liberal Chiefs are flouted !
Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT is rejected quite,
Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN is scouted,
And, worse than all, I even see you dare
To speak contemptuously of Mr. LABOUCHERE !
Here in the lordly columns of The Times,
Where Mr. WALKLEY writes and also Blowitz,
Where Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN prints his rhymes,
And other even less distinguished poets,
I find you scandalising English readers
By pouring scorn upon our dauntless Liberal Leaders !
Have you forgot how these devoted men
On your behalf have uniformly pleaded,
And laboured day by day with voice and pen
To give you the encouragement you needed ?
Have'you forgot the sympathetic bleating
Sir HENRY raised for you at each successive Meeting ?
It cannot be! The words set down above
Do not correctly represent your attitude,
Our Party's leaders still retain your love
Unless there's no such thing as human gratitude !
I ask-and ask with confidence how can a man
Do anything but love Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN !
It cannot be! The words you really used
About these men were glowing with affection,
Nor can the wicked scribbler be excused
Who gave them such a different complexion.
I'm certain you would never be so shabby
As to denounce that amiable trifler, LABBY !
No! when the gentlemen whom I have named
Were mentioned, your encomiums were hearty,
And in impressive accents you proclaimed
Your obligations to the Liberal Party.
While you expressed, again and yet again,
Your horror and contempt for Mr. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN !

A REMONSTRANCE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—During the past
week or two I have had a dim feeling
that my life was not going on in the
orderly and decorous fashion in which
it has proceeded for the past seventy
years. I have at last been forced to the
conclusion that the disturbance is in
some way connected with the coming
Coronation. I go down to my Club in
Piccadilly this morning to find the
front door barricaded, and an intima-
tion posted upon it that members
can only enter through the Mews at the
back. After devious wanderings I
make my way into the building. The
rooms are wrapped in gloom, caused by
huge wooden structures erected in front
of the windows. I go to my favourite
corner, where my special arm-chair has
stood for years. It is not there! In
fact the whole condition of the place
reminds me of the worst excesses of the
Diamond Jubilee.
Now, Sir, I feel that this kind of
thing is a subject for legitimate com-
plaint. No one has less objection to
his MAJESTY's being crowned than I
have, but I think it should be done in
such a way as to interfere as little as
possible with my comfort.
Yours fretfully,
An Old BUFFER.

A BALLAD OF THE LORD GREAT CHAMBERLAIN.
THREE noble lords claimed all in vain
The office of Lord Great Chamberlain.
The Earl of ANCASTER was one,
Another the good Earl CARRINGTON,
The third (whose name is pronounced so rolmondeley)
Was the most noble Marquess of CHOLMONDELEY !
The Court of Claims they tried and tried
To settle the case, but couldn't decide,
So finally they left the thing
In the hands of our Gracious Lord the King.
And the King selected that wise and colmondeley
Nobleman, the Marquess of CHOLMONDELEY!
The Lord Great Chamberlain takes his stand
To-morrow at the King's right hand,
He wears gold lace all over the place,
A star on his breast, and a smile on his face,
He doesn't perform his duties glolmondeley,
That high official, the Marquess of CHOLMONDELEY !
When the King is crowned all eyes remain
Fixed on the Lord Great Chamberlain ;
If there 's a hitch he's never in doubt,
He even orders the Bishops about,
And Peer and Prelate obey quite dolmondeley
The stern commands of the Marquess of CHOLMONDELEY!
CORONATION GOSSIP.-It having come to the ears of Mr.
PIERPONT MORGAN that the Lord of the Manor of Worksop has
the right to support the King's right arm at the Coronation
ceremony, Mr. MORGAN has purchased the Manor on behalf of
an American Syndicate. The members of the Syndicate
will take turns in supporting His MAJESTY's arm.

TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING.
And of their toil who lightly faced
Danger and death for this their best reward
To-day the garnered fruit is hers and yours.
So stands your Empire: over such a race,
Fearless and proud and free,
Whose hands have laid your Kingdom's base
Upon the outmost edges of the sea, —
Loyal all times and now
Fresh-proven in the fierce assay of war,
You take the seal of lordship on your brow.
My Liege and Sovereign Lord,
First of your line whose legend marks the might
Of Britain's Ocean-wide domain !
Ere yet to-morrow's light
Beholds you leave her high memorial fane,
By that irrevocable rite
Of solemn oath and lifted sword,
Of holy oil and sacramental cup,
Crowned and anointed King ;-
Before the dazing splendour blinds our sight,
And in our ears the gathered shout goes up
Of homage won from half the world;
And back from bended skies,
Flecked with the countless ripple of flags unfurled,
The shattering echoes ring and ring ;-
While still our suppliant breath may rise
Like incense on the waiting air,-
For you what vigil shall we hold to-night!
With what compelling prayer
Importune Him, the King of Kings,
To grant you health and years' increase,
Wisdom to keep your people's love,
And, other earthly gifts above,
The long-desired, the gift of Peace,
Alway to shield you with her shadowing wings!
Little he dreamed, the last wlio bore your name,
Our boy-King EDWARD, dying ere the prime
Of that adventurous age
That fixed his royal sister's fame-
Little he dreamed how fair a heritage
Should fall to England's crown in after time.
Beyond the seas that ringed his island realm
Scarce any owned him Lord ;
Great kingdoms stood that yet should reel
Beneath the clash of English steel,
Instant to overwhelm;
Far lands were yet to win from out the waste
By patient courage strong to tame
Wild natures, earth's and man's, and make
On rude inhospitable shores
New English homes for the old England's sake.
Small seems the labour, light the task
Of empery over lands that crave no more
The meed of conquering arms, but only ask
For silent annals after storm and strain.
And yet not easy is the weight to bear
That claims your kingly care.
To guard, unsullied still, that dear renown
Our fathers handed down ;
To help us hold, through peace, our warrior-rights
Won in a thousand fights,
And sacred by our blood and tears ;
To see we use, against the coming years,
Before its memory fade,
The lessons of the past, and draw
Knowledge from failure, and from loss a gain ;
To humble arrogance, the curse of ease ;
To make their consciences afraid
Who bid your England fold her hands in sleep;
To be of Truth the mirror, and a law
Of Honour unto men of all degrees ;
To champion the Faith and keep
The fear of God before your people's eyes ; -
Such royal service we, who gladly bring
Our own to greet you on your festal way-
We ask in turn of England's King !
And, so your heart be set on this,
Then let whatever need arise,
And come what perils may,
Be well assured you cannot miss
God's and your Country's love to be your stay!
O.S.

“MOTHER, may I go out to swim ?”
“Oh, yes, my darling daughter;
Hang your clothes on a hickory limb,
But don't go near the water.”
She doffed in haste her silken gown,
And tied her tresses wavy;
She donned her shoes of canvas brown,
And bathing dress of navy.
They stretched her on the floor at
length,
As though it were the ocean ;
They showed her how to strike with
strength
And set her limbs in motion.
And then she lay upon her back,
And carefully they taught her
The simple but effective knack
Of floating on the water.
She learnt to dive beneath the wave,
And, as a triumph crowning,
Could (theoretically) save
A person who was drowning.
In short she rescued every day
A sister or a cousin,
And at the annual display
Won medals by the dozen.
But still ambition stirred her heart;
An eager longing caught her ;
She needs must try her favourite art
For once within the water.
Alone she sought the willowy bank,
She gave one little shiver,
Then plunged upon the wave and sank
Deep, deep, into the river.
Then had she drowned without a doubt
Had not a passing stranger
With handy boat-hook fished her out
Beyond the reach of danger.

MR. PUNCH'S NOTES AND
QUERIES.
(A Peep into the Future.)
v.
Side Gin (30th S. viii. 377).-I find no
attempt in Skeat to explain this curious
phrase, which constantly occurs in
connection with the hebdomadal recrea-
tions of Parliamentary representatives
at the close of the nineteenth century.
The locus classicus is to be found in a
contemporary print, which states that
“Mr. BALFOUR was in excellent form
during his visit to Littlestone.” On
being asked by an interviewer to what
he attributed his success he laughingly
replied, “Abstinence from sloe gin!”
Mr. BALFOUR, a distinguished athlete,
seems to have been in the habit of
frequenting Littlestone for the purpose
of indulging in some occult species of
ball game, presumably of Scottish
origin, as Mr. BALFOUR was from beyond
the Border. “Sloe Gin,” then, is pro-
bably a Southern corruption of “Slogan,"
i.e., the war-cry or shout raised by
excited players. Others identify the
phrase with some implement used in
the game, the word "gin” being used
in the sense of “trap" (cf. trap, bat
and ball), while Professor DEWAR, of
Perth, holds that the phrase should be
written “Slow Gin,” i.e., a spirit the
effects of which were subtle and linger-
ing (cf. “Forty rod whiskey '').
H. CRAIK.
HASKELL BALL (30th S. viii. 551).—The
ordinary explanation of "Haskell Ball ”
is, I know, that it is a proper name,
and that HASKELL BALL was a brother of
a fire-eating Yeomanry officer named
JOHNNY BALL, of Hoylake, who was fre-
quently prosecuted for assaulting a
harmless and helpless old veteran named
Colonel Bogey. Plausible as this theory
undoubtedly is, I cannot help feeling it
to be insufficiently supported by con-
temporary evidence. For my own part
I feel convinced that “Haskell" is
merely a corruption of “ Ask-all," and
that the “ Ask-all Ball ” was a species
of entertainment organised on an
extremely democratic basis. I am con-
firmed in this view by the fact that a
certain writer named HORACE HUTCHINSON
speaks of a Haskell Ball as being

SILENT it stands, the shrine within whose walls
He was to give his kingly gage to-day;
And silent on our hearts the sorrow falls
Which only faith may stay.
Not for ourselves we mourn the moment's loss,
Our pleasure darkened and our sun gone down;
All thoughts are turned to where he bears the cross
Who should have worn the crown.
So keep we vigil; so a Nation's prayer
Humbly before the Eternal Heart we bring,
That of His grace and pity God may spare
And give us back our King !

-With C.-B.'s kind permission I've
been week-ending in Belgium. Just
back from Bruges, where in the Market
Place stands the belfry old and brown.
Thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded,
still it watches o'er the town. Went
to see Exhibition of the works of early
Flamand painters. A rare collection, in
number unique. In all there are some
three hundred pictures, dating from the
time of Melchior BROEDERLAM, in 1398,
up to PIERRE BRUEGEL le Vieux, who
flourished about 1568. Here are nearly
all the famous specimens of the early
schools of painting of Bruges, Ghent,
Brussels, Louvain and Antwerp. Never
before were so many of the master-
pieces of Hans Memling sheltered under
one roof. Among them is the “Chasse
de Sainte Ursule," precious beyond
its weight in gold. Of paintings large
and small, portraits and pious pictures,
there are from the Master's hand no
fewer than sixty-five.

DUT how do they propose to run the Government without your services ?" asked the War-and-Peace
D Maker, after a hearty exchange of military salutes with the Bouverie King of Arms.
“They do not,” replied Mr. PUNCH. “The bird-like ubiquity which was ever one of my most salient
features has been greatly enhanced by the purchase of the most recent type of Auto-Marconibile. Only yesterday
I was myself arranging the details of my Overflow Fête in London; and here I am to-day, come to join you on
the eve of your departure for England. There were enthusiasts, my Lord, who clamoured for your appearance in
the King's Procession when we were still anticipating that event. But I was never one of those who imagined that
you were likely, for the sake of immediate applause, to spoil the results of your splendid labours, just when you
were most needed to give them the finishing touches. And the few silly people, chiefly makers of headlines, who
thought you likely to hurry home for this purpose, must have understood your value and the nature of your work
pretty poorly. Besides, I wanted you, when you come, to have a Procession all to yourself.
“How good a turn of Peace-making you did, and how well your time has been occupied in the interval since
that operation, is plain to the rudest intelligence in the readiness with which our late enemies have accepted your
magnanimous conditions. You have by now practically shepherded all the outlying flock within the lion's fold.
I see that a rough reckoning of the forces that at one time or another have been engaged against you brings their
numbers up to some seventy or eighty thousand. These are what the Continental Press has agreed to describe as
the mere "handful of farmers ” that has had to withstand the full shock of the British Empire. In point of fact,
they amount to at least half as many again as our original fifty thousand absent-minded horse and foot going to
Table Bay. I say this with no desire to under-rate their prodigious pluck and cleverness, but rather in recognition
of the greatness of the task that you have brought to so happy a conclusion. But Peace, or the making of Peace-
for we have yet to prove it, though for myself I entertain no apprehensions as to its complete success—Peace, in
your case, has had its victories no less renowned than War. Just as we recognise the astonishing patience which
your sapper instinct has shown in the steady chaining off of so vast a tract of territory—a patience which is no
less genius because it does not contain the showy elements that appeal to the popular imagination-80 we recognise
also the high qualities you have exhibited in that diplomacy for which your energy in the field was the necessary
preparation. Those of us who remembered your part in the affair of Fashoda were never doubtful of the issue of
a conference in which your tact should have full play. We understand, too, that you displayed in the Peace
discussion a pretty turn for humour, a quality most desirable even in the highest ranks of the service.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Well, my Lord, we are very conscious of our obligations to you; and I, for one, while fully appreciating
the services rendered by the Earl Bobs at a crucial point in the campaign, would be inclined to place yours,
rendered, as they mainly were, after the war “was practically finished," at as high a value as his, so far as
the Nation's testimonial can represent such service. But you are still young, and your work but just begun.
India has need of you : though we rather grudge her those gifts for organisation which are so badly needed in
Pall Mall.
“Meanwhile, do not imagine that we have been idle at home. Reform is in the air. By our new
system of military education, the cadet is to be taught to place the practice of War above even that of Polo: and
the cavalry-officer to hold the correct art of letter-writing in higher regard than the more obvious claims of
the regimental drag. Further, we have already adopted a new Teutonic service-cap something like a depressed
soufflé. We have devised a new Infantry Drill. We stand at ease now on two legs instead of one. We turn
right, left and about by pirouetting on one heel and one toe, without moving the foot back. There is a gain
here in point of picturesqueness as well as instability. We have abandoned the practice of shouldering arins, and
now do everything at or from the slope. Under the new scheme, when carryin z arms, our sole method of saluting
is to stare in the direction of the object of our veneration. Thus, when a nicely-bred private of the Inns of Court
Volunteers (for example) is introduced, under arms, to a Peeress, let us say, of civilian instincts, this method of salute
is apt to be misunderstood. How far the new practice has been derived from the methods of recognition employed
in the case of Kaffir women I can only conjecture, but I have said enough to show that the lessons of the War
are not going to be wasted if the Authorities at home can help it.
“And now, my Lord, for I have not come all this way merely to boast of the advances we are making in
military reform, let me once more sincerely compliment you on the success which has attended your work both in
the field and the debating-hall; and in view, particularly, of the reputation you have established for humour in your
treatment of delegate questions, permit me to present you with a masterpiece of my own in this kind; a work,
moreover, in which you will find the phases of the last chapter of your exploits presented with unfailing discern-
ment, appreciation, and bonne camaraderie; I refer, shortly, to that fund of good fellowship and acumen, my

An Overflow Fête
(Designed by His Majesty's most Loyal Servant
Mr. PUNCH.)
Extract of June 1st, 1902.*
E have it on the highest authority, nothing lower in fact than that of Our Own
Special Court Eavesdropper and Keyhole Correspondent, that the King has found
himself unable to cope single-handed with the heavy duties involved in the
entertainment of His Majesty's Coronation Guests. Accordingly, it became
necessary for him to call in the services of a deputy. It was obvious that the
choice of such a representative would have to fall upon one who not only possessed
an untarnished reputation for the highest loyalty, but already enjoyed a position so
far removed by its inherent dignity above the dreams of avarice, that he would
have no difficulty in executing the duties of his
high office without fear or favour. Nobody, there-
fore, who had ever been permitted to share the
King's confidence, or was at all familiar with
His Majesty's tastes and predilections, expressed
either surprise or envy when the choice fell upon
Mr. Punch.

On receipt of the Royal Command our esteemed
contemporary presented himself at Buckingham
Palace, where he was invited to a private audience.
We understand, from the authority above men-
tioned, that His Majesty King EDWARD, who
was alone and unarmed, informed Mr. Punch,
confidentially, of the enormous access of guests
which His MAJESTY anticipated in view of the
forthcoming Coronation. The King further ex-
pressed a desire (tantamount to a command) that
Mr. Punch would take upon his own loyal hump
some of the burden which might otherwise prove
an inconvenience to His Majesty's shoulders.
It was the King's idea that My. Punch should
institute proceedings of the nature of an Overflow
Ceremony for the more complete entertainment
of His Majesty's visitors and loyal lieges. The
King's suggestion (which has the force of a Royal
order) was that this orgie should contain features
which it had been found impossible to embrace
in the official programme; such as, for example,
a River Pageant and a glorified Lord Mayor's
Show, the latter to cover ground, if any, not

included in the Royal Progress by land or sea; the whole to conclude with a Gala Performance on the
established lines of a Benefit at the National Opera House.
All details 'should be left to Mr. Punch's known discretion, the only limitation being that the various
features of the entertainment should be in some way characteristic of British habits as well as of British taste
in decorative Art. And lest the public should remain
unaware of His Majesty's intentions, it was arranged
that Mr. Punch should be allowed to issue, at convenient
spots, a proclamation bearing the Royal Warrant,
and explaining that it was the King's pleasure to
appoint Mr. Punch his deputy for the purposes therein
set forth.
At the close of this unique audience Mr. Punch,
tactfully restraining a tendency to swell with pride,
executed a loyal genuflection, kissed the Royal band,
and gave expression to his obedient homage in the
following simple phrases :-
“Sire, I am wholly at Your Majesty's service.
It shall be my pride and joy to faithfully execute
Your MAJESTY's behests." (The split infinitive must
be ascribed to stress of emotion.) So saying, and
preceded by his dorsal excrescence, he bowed himself
out of the Audience Chamber.

Extract of June 8th.
OM
To-morrow, by the King's pleasure, the announce-
ment to which on the strength of exclusive information
we were enabled a week ago to refer, a proclamation will
be heralded by Mr. Purch, Bouverie King of Arms,
attended by TOBY, F.S.A., Chat Noir Poursuivant.
The proclamation will be read consecutively from the
summit of each of the Seven Hills on which the Metro-
polis is based; namely, Constitution Hill, Notting Hill,
Mr. Punch holding a Court of Overflow Claims. Primrose Hill, High Holborn, Ludgate Hill, Tulse Hill,
and Brixton Rise.
We herewith give an outline of its purport, for which our authority is a menial whose incognito we rightly
respect. On a day (not yet fixed) in the week following the Coronation an Overflow Fête will be organised under
the direction of Mr. Punch, acting as His Majesty's deputy. This will assume the form of
(1) A Procession of Emblematic Motor Cars, which will traverse those portions of London that lie outside
the route selected for the Official Progresses. The actual direction to be chosen will not be divulged till you see it.
Much will depend not only on the weather and the state of the ground, but also on the arbitrary behaviour of the
vehicles that take part in the spectacle. Some of these, it is anticipated, may break off at any time into subsidiary
groups of one or more units.
(2) A River Pageant, starting from the Temple steps in the vicinity of the Punch Office), and eventually
proceeding to the Terrace of the House of Commons, where a pause will be made to admit of a Regatta, and
then back again to the Temple steps. It is not contemplated that this Pageant should be historically allusive,
apart from the presence of the Convict Ship, manned by spectators. The constituent vessels will simply serve
to exhibit for the benefit of illustrious guests the everyday resources of our noble river and the justly celebrated
fleet that helps to distinguish it from other rivers. Details of the Regatta, which is to include a race between
submarine clinkers representing the Government and the Opposition, will be shortly forthcoming.
(3) A Gala Performance, embracing Burlesques, extracts from favourite Operas, original adaptations from
the French and other languages, A Masque of Poets in Hades, Special Poems to be composed and recited by

well-known public men, and a Prologue and Epilogue
by the Master of the Ceremonies, with encores as occa-
sion may arise.
In view of the probability that many Persons of
Merit will desire to fulfil some public function in these
Celebrations, a Court of Overflow Claims will be held. '
Candidates, however, will be invited to apply by letter,
and not in person. This decree, it is thought, will
obviate any exhibition of false modesty, and will also
serve to temper the chagrin of disappointed applicants.
The decision of the Master of the Ceremonies will, in
all cases, be final.

the Reform of Printers' Customs (though he repudiated

Extract of June 23rd.
Procession of Emblematic Motor-Cars.
We think that Mr. Punch has been well advised in declining to make any definite pronouncement as to the
line of route of the Overflow Procession. Much, as he rightly points out, must depend on the initiative of the
motor-cars themselves. The object which he has at heart is to supplement the King's two limited progresses
by bringing his own Procession, so to speak, to everybody's door. Nihil, as he so happily puts it, nihil Metro-
politani a me alienum puto. But it is possible that some of the constituent elements of his Pageant may be
permanently injured in the attempt to climb obstacles, such as houses or monumental pedestals, or, by a sudden
revulsion of motor-power, retrace the course which they have covered. In any case he has recommended the
population to keep at home and wait till the cars roll by. For ourselves, we can only say that every reader of the
Lion's Daily Meal is entitled to a free seat on the curbstone almost anywhere.
For the guidance of those who find difficulty in translating allegories, we append a selection from the various
emblematic motor-cars which will take part in the Procession.

Car emblematic of British Art.-Surmounted by a corps of Kodak Sharp-shooters. Motto: “Actuality; or
We press the button, Nature does the rest." Chauffeur, Mr. Clement Shorter, who will conduct it in camera.
Emblematic Restaurant Car (Frying-Panhard type).–Central figure, the Chef of the Carlton, surrounded
by Primrose Peeresses who have the privilege of the entrée.
Car emblematic of British Drama.—This will be modelled on the lines of the victorious chariot in Ben Hur.
Car emblematic of Popular Literature.—Mr. Hall Caine will sit on a model of the Dome of St. Peter's,
wearing a scarf embroidered with the observation : “ Rome has no secrets from me." Chauffeur, Mr. A. P.
Watt, Literary Agent; but Mr. Caine will work the hooter.
Car emblematic of British Self-control. Surmounted by a Hooligan (inebriated) and his lady, out on the
Peace-path, assaulting the Police with olive-tiddlers, and shouting “Good old Buller!” “What price
Kitch?” etc. Motto on one side of flag: Æquam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem; on the other
side: Non secus in bonis ab insolenti temperatam lætitia.
International Car emblematic of Music (Götter-Daimler pattern).—Made in Germany and surmounted
by patrons of the “Ring." The hooter will be worked by the popular author of The Honeysuckle and the Bee,
representing British music.
Ambulance Car (one remount-power).-Containing War Office officials.
There will be other cars emblematic of Flannelled Folly, Marconigraphy, the Power of the Press, and
similar signs of the times. The rear will be brought up by a car which might otherwise retard the pace of the
Procession. It will be a Sleeping Car, emblematic of British Enterprise and fitted with a powerful Trade Union
Brake. In front of it will walk a British workman, bearing a flag with the motto, “ We level down."

The River Pageant.
Ulus
We understand that it is the intention of the organizer
of the Water Procession merely to exhibit the every day
resources of that mighty river on which stands the capital
of the greatest Naval Power. Just as at Spithead we shall
simply expose the superfluous strength of our Fleet in Being,
without weakening its protective force as distributed over
the seven or more seas which wash the terrestrial globe, so
in the Water Pageant no attempt will be made to utilize
for the occasion any example either of Beauty or Dignity
in the construction of river craft other than those which are
connected with Metropolitan traditions, and are, in a word,
ever with us. The typical pleasure steamer (temporarily in
disuse), the common barge, the dredger, the police-boat,
the tug—these alone will figure in the Procession. The
route, owing to force of habit on the part of the pleasure-packets, will probably
assume a zig-zag course; running from the Temple steps to the Tower Bridge
and thence to the House of Commons Terrace, where there will be an interval
for refreshments and a Regatta.
The programme will include the following events :
1. A Race between Submarine Clinker-built Eights, representing the Government and the Opposition. The

The seating and feeding arrangements have been largely left in the hands of Dr. Sally Lynn, who has
chartered at enormous expense the historic Convict Ship which has lately created so powerful a sensation oui
Waterloo Bridge. Masthead seats and rigging accommodation will be let at twenty-five guineas; the paddle-
boxes and bowsprit will be the same price; portholes for two will be £15 apiece, and sitting room in the
coal-bunks below the water-line proportionately less.
The Gala Performance.
By the courtesy of the Management we are enabled to present our readers with a Programme of the
Gala Performance to take place the same evening at the National Opera House. Permission has been further
accorded us to publish the words of some of the proposed recitations; also the text of the Masque of Poets in
Hades. The following is a complete list of the various turns, though their number and variety is so generous that
it is anticipated that some selection will be found necessary on the actual night if our guests are to reach
home before the break of the next day but one.

1. Mr. Punch, after presenting a bouquet to Her
Majesty the Queen, will deliver the following
Prologue.
CHOWA
Kings, Presidents, and various Powers of Earth,
Assembled here to share our harmless mirth!
And ye that at considerable pains
Have followed in your Masters' special trains,
Swarming from all the Continents that be,
And islands in, or else beyond, the Sea!
First, to my Royal Liege, if he'll
allow me,
In low obeisance I should like to
bow me.
[Turns towards Royal
Box and does so.

Next, to our noble Coronation
guests
(Distinguished by the orders on
their chests),
Who have so kindly crossed the
sundering foam,
I give this greeting—Make your-
selves at home!

Ye have beheld our country's leading stars
Mounted on emblematic motor-cars,
And have enjoyed that unexampled treat,
The splendid pageant of our River Fleet.
And now, to crown the long delirious day,
Nor will I go, in vulgar phrase, the whole hog,
As is the common custom in a Prologue,
And ask for your applause; of that I'm certain ;
And so proceed to elevate the curtain.

And send you more than satisfied away,
With your polite consent we here engage
To illustrate upon the British stage
Those gifts that cause our fame to stream
afar,
And go, in fact, to make us what we are..
Nor do we merely purpose in the Bill
To prove our dramatists' adaptive skill,
By samples showing how our native pen
Assimilates the work of alien men,
But we intend profusely to supply
The genuine products of our genii;
We have secured our champion poet's aid; he's
Promised to figure in A Masque of Hades,
And demonstrate, if there is still a doubt of it,
That, matched with Phillips, SOPHOCLES is out
of it.
But most we mean to have your ears in thrall
With the pure magic of the Music Hall,
And through this highest form of local Art
Put you in touch with England's throbbing
heart.

Ride,

And RUDYARD rake the gallery with his rhymes,

CHORUS OF SHADES.
To that day of the past
My memories rove
When the battle waxed fast
In this shadowy grove,
As EURIPIDES, straw-splitting quibbler,
And thundering ÆSCHYLUS strove.
For Sophocles hoar,
So gentle of old,
Who never before
Would wrangle or scold,
Is bent on another great contest-
Oh! may I be there to behold!
They say that the light
Of his genius fails,
And even the bright
Star of Æschylus pales
When the glorious sun of young Phillips
At noonday resplendently sails.
So Hermes has sped
To Her Majesty's, far
From the realms of the dead,
With the speed of a star,
If haply the poet's at leisure,
To bring him—but lo! here they are !
Enter Hermes, supporting Stephen Phillips.
Hermes. Buck up! The worst of it is past, my lad !
O Chorus, what a time of it I've had !
Scarce could I lure his lagging limbs along ;
He blenched and shuddered when he saw the throng
Of suicidal gentlemen and ladies
Who hover in his Virgil-Homer Hades;
He shrieked aloud when CHARON hove in sight,
And clung to me, and all but died of fright,
And at “the woe of TANTALUS and the fruit”
Each hair stood upright, rigid from the root.
Cho. Lo! his teeth still rattle and his eyes dilate !
How shall he do battle in his present state ?

HOCLES.
Let us all befriend him! Bathe his pallid brow!
Carefully we tend him! See! He's better now!
Her. And in good time, for lo! upon the stage
Once gentle Sophocles, now black with rage !
Cho. You remember that contest of yore
To which I've alluded before ?-
When ÆschyLUS warmed to his work, how he stormed!
And oh ! how EURIPIDES swore !
But to-day let me hope that these twain
From vulgar abuse will refrain,
Whate'er the temptation to recrimination,
From Billingsgate sternly abstain.
Enter SOPHOCLES.
Sophocles. I will not yield my throne, that will I not,
To any plagiarist
S.P.
To any what ?
Soph. To any plagiarist, I say again.
S. P. The word is ugly. Prithee, Sir, explain.
Soph. Explain? Thou knowest in thy secret heart
That all thy play is Homer's
S. P.
Save the art
Which made a drama-
Soph.
Which an epic marred.
O Stephen, know that it is not more hard
To mingle oil and water than to say
To elemental epic, “Be a play!”
Cho. Yes, I know; that is so; and I really must say
What is fit for an epic ain't fit for a play.
Soph. I showed thy play to Homer. In the crowd
Of corpses, one had smuggled in his shroud
A copy of your latest. “Who," quoth he,
“ Is this Ulysses ?” “Read,” said I, “and see.”
He read a little. “Zeus! why so misnamed ?
It is my own Odysseus ! ” he exclaimed ;
“But why, O why Ulysses ?” “Nay, my friend,
That's something more than I can comprehend."
Cho. Now you call our attention to that which you
mention, it certainly strikes us as queer O,
When the rest are all Greek, that the poet should seek
a name that's not Greek for his hero.
Soph. Homer read on. “The minstrel too,” said he,
“ And, as he sings, enter Penelope,
The exits and the entrances are mine :
Then, prithee, Stephen Phillips, what is thine ?
Next tell me, Stephen, how you dared defile
The solitude of lone Calypso 's isle
With ballet-girls in scantiest of trousseaus,
And half-a-dozen Drury-Lane-like Crusoes ?
Cho. It certainly seems like the maddest of dreams that
a lonely Ogygian valley
Should be rudely disturbed by the oglings uncurbed of
an airily clad corps de ballet.
Soph. 'Twas ever held, in highest tragic art
Mere farce and melodrama have no part:
Then how defend Ctesippus' vulgar gambols
And your concluding sanguinary shambles ?
Hermes. Hold, Sophocles! Your water-clock is done.
'Tis Stephen's turn. Attention, every one!
S. P. Although the situation bids me blow
My braggart trumpet, Modesty says no !
Let others speak. Behold my friends! A host !
News, Standard, Chronicle and Morning Post !
Cho. Oh, how did you contrive to ferry
Across the Styx this heavy freight ?
Old Charon always swears his wherry
Will sink beneath the slightest weight.
He makes men leave their pride and vapours
Before he takes them in his charge-
Then how did you bring all these papers,
And never sink the crazy barge ?
S. P. At first he asked what had I to declare.
“Oh, daily papers—trifles light as air.”
Peruse them; you will see, my latest play
Out-Herods Herod.
Cho.
So, no doubt, they say.
S. P. Did SOPHOCLES, or any of the Greeks
Secure so many good first-night critiques ?
Cho. We are bound to confess the Athenian Press has
never at any time shown us
Such a chorus in praise of our very best plays, like the
Edipus, say, at Colonus.
S. P. (aside. That trick is mine. I win. Yet, I
believe,
My trump-card still is lurking up my sleeve.
I'll play it. Sophocles, when first the bays,
Bound on thy laureate brow, proclaimed thy
plays
Unconquered, and the prize awarded thee,
Even then, i' thy palmiest days, didst ever see
Thy drawing, shaded by no mortal hand,
Adorn a window in the wondering Strand ?
Cho. Behold! He is dumb! He is quite overcome
At this symptom of genius true.
Will he storm? Will he rage? Will he rush off the
stage ?
Oh, what will he—what will he do?
Soph. Stephen, no more! The throne that has been
mine
Since Æschylus did leave it me, is thine.
Cho. Hail, poet of poets! Come, sing,
Ye Nine from Pieria's spring,
The praises of Stephen, whom Sophocles even
Admits as our Tragedy King.

Phrased with befitting dignity of speech ;
Next, place Two Crowns upon Two Royal Brows,

And then keep silence, while in roundelays
Which, I opine, “may soothe some sufferer's lot"
When “new and noisier notes" (namely R.K.'s)
Are clean forgot
I bid the Lion of the Land arise,
Grasping that Flag of Freedom in his paw,
Which in such various localities
The Ophir saw.
Dread Destiny withal I charge to fill
With devastating draught her cruel cup,
Which having drunk, our envious rivals will
Simply curl up.
I bid the Lion-cubs to gather fast,
Flying, as swallows fly, across the waves,
Adding that Britons never will be classed
Withal as slaves.
SHERR
I sing of Realms imperishably set
Above the sands of time, of Empires fixed
Upon “ the wave-wide track;" in fact, I get
A trifle mixed.
The soaring Poet spurns the
common ground
And, as I warble to each hemisphere,
Comes the responsive cry from West and East:-
“Oh make the Bard, if possible, a Peer-
A Knight, at least.”

11. Mr. RUDYARD Kipling, in his universal athletic costume, will recite a New and Original Epochmaker,
entitled,
The Chantey of the Nations.
GREAT BRITAIN
ITALY.
Sons of the Blood, which is twice as thick as water is, Thus saith the Voice to the men of V. Emmanuel:
Lock, stock and barrel of the Race that rules the Sea! “Ye are not fair-weather friends, ye stick through
Ye have left your occupation
storm and rain;
At the Mother's invitation,
Ye have lent our land the Duse,
Left the ice-floe, and the swamp and the jungly
And we could not well refuse a
mango-tree!
Debt of honour, so we sent you our Corelli and
our Caine."
I am the Bard, it is I that make the Catalogues,
I that give the Oracles that otherwise were dumb;
I am KIPLING, I'm the Voice,
T ROME ?
I'm the Chosen People's Choice,
I'm the Words and Music also, I'm the Drummer
and the Drum.
What I have said I have said, and pretty often too,
Hinting of the heritage that goes with British birth;
But to-night it might be pleasant
To address the Nations present
Who are not as yet embodied in the Lordliest Thing
on Earth.
FRANCE
Thus saith the Voice to the genial Boulevardiers :
“ Welcome, gallant neighbours, I've a word to say to
you:
Could ye get your gutter Press
Just to lie a little less,
Ye might soon forget Fashoda, and the shock of
Waterloo."
Our Corelli and our Caine.
AUSTRIA
Thus saith the Voice to the braves of Francis-
Joseph Land,
Dwellers by the Danube in the home of cakes and
bock;
“Ye have shown us what to waltz to,
But ye have your little faults too,
And ye sold us Hungary chargers, five-and-forty
pounds a crock.”
GERMANY
Thus saith the Voice to the Teutons of the Fatherland,
“ Hail ! Kaiser's men, out of Berlin on the Spree;
If your students thirst for knowledge
By a course at Oxford College
They might learn to know us better and behave more
cousinly."
RUSSIA.
Thus saith the Voice, “ Ye have seen us, o ye
Muscovites,
Seen our Thameski Prospect and the City paved
with Tin :
Ye have marked the friendly air
We adopt towards the Bear,
Will ye veil in turn the Tartar underneath your
velvet skin ?"
JAPAN.
Thus saith the Voice to the wearers of Chrysanthe-
mums:
“ East is West and West is East, for now the twain
are one;
We are white and ye are yellow,
Ye are young and we are mellow,
Yet we 'll hold the Seas together for the Lion and
the Sun."
The Hungary Charger.

13. Epilogue.
(Composed and delivered by Mr. Punch.)
Now my charms are all o'erthrown
(This remark is Shakespeare's own),
But before you take your rest
I've a something on my breast,
Which, when I have let it go,
Absolutely ends the show.
We have done the best we could,
And we think you found it good,
Judging by the genial tone
You have very kindly shown.
Some have laughed and some have wept,
Some, I noticed, frankly slept,
But not one was heard to scoff,
Or to let revolvers off.
And especially we thank
Any here of royal rank
Who have travelled countless miles
From the Less Pacific isles,
And to-night so calmly bore
Things they never faced before-
Did not once attempt to rise
And spit us on their assegais,
But in courteous silence sat :
We are much obliged for that.
And now, good gentles, we shall not be long,
If you will please to join me in a song.
The language, I admit, is not sublime,
And only here and there achieves a rhyme ;
But, barring portions of the second verse,
The meaning 's good, or might at least be worse,
And I am confident it will—in parts-
Awake a loyal echo in your hearts.
Come, then, and let us uniformly sing,
Upstanding, if you please, God Save the King.
God Save the king.
