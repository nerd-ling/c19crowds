PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHERE SHALL WE GO?
IN answer to this seasonable question Mr. Punch has
pleasure in calling attention to the claims of a health resort
(in the neighbourhood of Geneva), from the prospectus of
which he extracts a few luminous passages. (Address on
application.)
a climateric station
beneficial for patients suffering from
anomiu and overwork. What doe* the jaded citizen ask for when, in his
office, he is lurfeioted with figures, ink and papers? Is it not to wander
under the forest's verdant vault, to hearken to the soughing of the wuu
through the foliage, to inhale the aromatic parfume of plants 1 .... Hen
leisure is so smeet, that it tempts not the visitor to nsk life or limb ii
perilous mountain excursions. The is the «nly alluring peak, but it i
generally neglected by the fascinated stranger .... Here and there ii
fancy places bemches of cytious bedraggle their golden flowers .... Pro
tected and overshadowed by the wet foliage, the forest seems unruffled by th
hand of Han. Trees, plants and wild flowers IB pugnacious entanglemen
give one the feeling of Prehistory Liberty .... The noumerous guests i ha
yearly visit leave it strengthened in body and soul. These, who*
blood is poor and nerves week become ruddy and vigorous .... rollickin,
joy becomes their second nature."

DUG! REDUCI.
AIR—" Une Marquise " (Mr. AUSTIN- DOBSOK).
I.
HOMEWARD bound from overseas,
K. of K.!
Lightly let the sequent breeze
Round you play;
You who know what danger is, K.,
Yet have never learned to swoon,
May the bounding deeps of Biscay
Find your martial maw immune!
Do not dash anticipation—
So they pray
Who have sketched your debarkation
Ere the day;
Who with eagle nerve have nicked you
By a fine prophetic swoop,
And (for Friday next) depict you
Sternly gazing from the poop.
Come before our joy is jaded,
K. of K.,
And the flush of Peace has faded
Into gray!
Shall the poet's faith be stamped on
Who accosts your urgent keel?
Will you stultify Southampton,
Where the Mayor has booked a meal?
Where in terms profuse and brainy
He prepares to greet you thus:
"Scipio South-Africane!
Welcome! you are one of Us!
Take our freedom: we adore you!"
He will say:
All of which is bound to bore you,
K. of K.
Yet, because we want you home,
Do not dally with the foam;
Though our love is pure asbestus
Let delay no longer test us;
Rise like VENUS in her cestus
"'Crost the Bay;"

You 're a worker from of old.
K. of K.
Pomps and pseans leave you cold,
K. of K.
You would like to land in mufti,
You would hurry down the dock
Not in trappings, plumed and tufty,
But in checks and billycock!
And you haven't, now It's over,
Come to stay;
Nor to lie at length in clover,
But to change your train for Dover,
K. of K.
For, although the work's appalling
Which should have you here at hand,
Yet you 've heard the East a-calling
Out of India's coral strand;
And, as soon as time and place
Let our feelings find release,
And we 've called you, to your face,
First in War and first in Peace;—
Thither where the Empire needs you,
K. of K.,
And your own " Ubique " leads you,
Lies your way! 0. S.
A GRAND NIGHT AT THE LYCEUM.
WHAT a transformation scene! Within half an hour
after Mephistopheles had taken Faust off to " another place"
'not the Upper House), the Lyceum stage and auditorium
were transformed, as by magic, into one gorgeous Hall of
Audience, brilliantly and tastefully illuminated, where
hundreds of distinguished guests of all colours, and a large
number, such as the Rajahs and Imperial Stars of India, in
glittering and bewildering costumes, thronged the house,
and were received by Sir HENRY IRVING, our Sir HENRY, in
most courtly style. Whether the language used were the
classic Hindostanee, elegant Gum-Arabic, Royal Rajputanik,
Gracious Golliwoggic, Curious Cooch Beharric, or any other
of the rare Indian dialects, Sir HENRY used them all up in
complimentary speeches, with more than a word and a bow
for every one of the Distinguished Foreigners as they
mutually salaam'd and saluted, and, with hand on heart and
liead bowed low, made protestations of sincerest admiration
and compatriotic affection.
American cousins, brothers, uncles and aunts were there,
headed by their witty and cheery representative, Mr. CHOATE.
U. S. A. Ambassador; then came our stalwart Colonials
in and out of uniform, diplomats with stars (and perhaps
garters), and general warriors ready for another champagne at
the supper table; artists, authors dramatic and undramatic,
beautiful ladies, pretty and joyous girls—in fact, everybody
one has ever heard or thought of, " all there," and "all in to
begin" supper whenever Mr. BRAM STOKER, who keeps the
Lyceum engines going at high pressure, as Master of Cere-
monies and Professor of Oriental Languages, might direct
the supper-numerary guests to the pastures of Refreshment-
Table Land. It is a memorable night, and all, heartily
fraternising, toast with heart and voice the health of KING
and EMPEROR. And as among the Cavaliers, in Puritan days,
so now, in a somewhat different sense, we hopefully drink to
"The Restoration!"

MR. PUNCH'S SKETCHY]
INTERVIEWS.
II.—MR. BEERBOHM TREE.
I WAS shown into the Actor-Manager's
dressing-room at Her Majesty's, and,
while waiting for its gifted occupant, I
had leisure to glance round. What a
wonder-house! What a treasury of
tokens of friendship, of Protean per-
sonality! Surely there is no man with
so many friends as HERBERT BEERBOHM
TREE.
I must have said something of the
kind aloud, for Mr. TREE, entering at
this moment, remarked cheerily, "Yes,
indeed. I am truly a popular man.
There is hardly an article in this room
that has not come warm and palpitating
straight from a Bohemian heart.

"I am perhaps the busiest of men."
"That cigarette boi was from dear
IRVING. Ah me! the Tabs it has held!
That Tantalus—but I must stop. 1
have really only five minutes to give
you. I am, you know, the busiest of
men. Letters to write, plays to read,
luncheons to attend, bazaars to open,
receptions, rehearsals! It has been said
of me," he added with a light laugh,
"that I rest only on the stage
Eh?"
"But you keep well, Mr. TREE?"
"Ah, one must, one must. But
there are limits; I shall not go into
Parliament."
"What is your secret of health?"
"Well, there are many specifics, but
I prefer limelight to all others. I
take it regularly—the true Limelight
Cordial."
"Is that all?"

"I prefer limelight to all others."
"And I eat heartily. To look at my
willowy figure, more suited to play
Slender than Falstaff"
I laughed politely.
"Thank you—to look at my willowy
figure, more suitable to play Slender
than Falstaff, you would think that
I was a spare eater; on the contrary, it
is my ambition to play Falgtaff without
padding."

"It is my ambition to plav Fdlitaf without
padding."
I expressed my admiration of the
courageous sentiment.
"And now," he said, "I must turn
you out. I have much to do. I expect
Mr. PHILLIPS himself. Mr. PHILLIPS,"
he added, "I would I had him here
always. Poetry and the drama should
never be parted."
LADY CLARA VRAIE DE VRAIE.
(With acknowledgments to the" P. M.O."
for suggesting the title.)
["A Peer's Daughter " in the Ladj't Btalm for
Julygives a glowing description of what she saw
of the Coronation and the next day's procession,
and then goes on to criticise the Gala Performance,
which is still in the future. "The gala night at
the Opera," she says, "was a disappointment to
many, no doubt, but certainly not to nil. Seldom
have we had a worse chorus .... tM unrivalled
JEAN has not the wonderful power ha had
once, and if M KI.I:A is as delicious as ever she is no
better. As for CAHUSO, he is a distinct disappoint-
ment!"]
A Cautious Editor sings:
LADY CLARA VRAIE DE VRAIE,
Of me you shall not win renown:
You thought to palm me off some " pars ''
Of gossip when you came to town.
At me you smiled, but unbeguiled
From your acquaintance I retired:
Soi-disant daughter of a Peer,
'You are not one to be desired.
Lady CLARA VRAIE DE VRAIE,
Some smarter journal you must find,
For were you queen of Paper-land,
I could not stoop to such a mind.
You sought to make a "scoop" and
fake
Some " copy " ready for July,
Describing things that ne'er took place
As if they 'd met your previous eye.
Lady CLARA VRAIE DE VRAIE,
You put strange fancies in my head.
A great dairvoyante you may be,
But are your comments quite well-
bred?
A picture gay of Crowning Day
With many a purple patch you drew;
The jewels, orders, all within
The Abbey charmed your private view.
Trust me, CLARA VRAIE DE VRAIE,
Had you but stuck to praise, 'twere
But when you come to criticise [well;
What never happened, I rebel:
The Gala Night with petty spite
You slated weeks ahead, I fear;
Your manners have not that repose
Which stamps the caste of VERB DE
VERB.
CLARA, CIARA VRAIE DE VRAIE,
Was it indeed so just and wise
The "stars " and chorus ere they Bang
As failures all to stigmatise?
Howe'er it be, it seems to me
Such journalism 's hardly good ;,
Plain facts are more than coronets,
And honesty than Norman blood.

MR. PUNCH'S NATIONAL DRAMAS.
VI.—FKOM TEE POET LAUREATE.
No collection of National Dramas would be complete
without a play from the pen of Mr. AUSTIN. Unhappily,
Mr. AUSTIN does not write plays. But it is always possible
to "adapt" one of his works for the stage. The poem
selected for this rather drastic treatment is A Tale of True
Love, which adorns his last volume of verse, and the
adaptation is carried out on the most approved modern
lines; that is to say, the adapter has embodied in the
text of his play as much of his author's verse as he could
conveniently lay hands on, thereby saving himself the trouble
of original metrical composition. He has then filled in with
lines of his own where this source failed. The result is a
sort of dramatic suet pudding in which the dough is the
adapter's, while the plums are, of course, Mr. AUSTIN'S. In
order to distinguish the dough from the plums the former
is printed^ in italics, while the latter, being the Laureate's
ipsissima verba, appear in all the dignity of Roman type.
ACT I.—SCENE—The Hall at Avoncourt, a venerable man-
sion greatly out of repair. As tlie curtain rises Sir
An i;i.i>, a young man of feudal appearance, enters try
the front door, followed by EGERIA, a lady whom he has
just met trespassing in his p^ark.
Egeria (pausing on threshold), lorgive, I pray, an overbold
intruder.
Sir Alured. I doubt if anywhere you would intrude!
(Gloomily.) But sooth none do on this survival Tudor.
Egeria (aside). His notions of a compliment are crude,
(aloud) Tudor! No, no, I never saw a man
More unmistakably Victorian.
Sir A. (annoyed). I meant the house.
Egeria (in some confusion, to judge by her grammatical con-
struction). Indeed? I never saw
Aught that I so admired or felt for so much awe.
Sir A. (incoherent from gratification).
Will you, I round it willingly can guide you,
Unless—and, told, shall fully understand—
Wander you rather would with none beside you
. To mar the silence of the windless land
Saving Spring's choristers, whose constant trills
One hears, or does not hear, according as one wills!
Egeria (aside). How very odd he is! (Aloud.) You mean,
in short,
That birds are plentiful at Avoncourt?
Sir A. (bowing). Just so.
Egeria. You know the house?
Sir A. (proudly). I ought to know it.
Here was I born, here grew to boy's estate,
Pored o'er the page of storier and poet,
All that is big, magnanimous and great,
Hardened my own, tried my dear mother's nerves,
Robbed the home orchard, poached my father's own
preserves.
Result: some painful scenes at which I holloa'd.
But I would rather not describe what followed.
Egeria. And are you now its occupant and possessor?
Sic A. (bitterly) So called, alas ! whose ancestors have paid
The final tax, by Death the stern assessor
On all poor mortals equitably laid.
Egeria (prosaically). Death and Sir WILLIAM HABOOUBT, if you
mean them,
Have ruined scores of landowners between them.
Sir A. I have a leasehold (mournfully). No one can hav<
more
This side at least the vague, still undiscovered shore!
Egeria (pricking up her ears). A leasehold?
Sir A. It's entailed.
'geria. Oh, what a bore!
Sir A. To strangers Avoncourt must never pass,
I may not sett it, much as I regret it,
So, as I 'TO pressed for money, I must let it.
Igeria. Hoic very sad for you!
Sir A. (thinking aloud—the stage direction is Mr. AUSTIN'S).
Withal, alas!
Sit by its hearth they must, and much I fear
That there they must abide for many a coming year.
Egeria. The tenants?
Sir A. Yes.
Kgeria. The sentence was obscure.
I thought you meant them, but I wasn't sure.
Sir A. It seems the only way to meet the case.
Egeria. No, no, I 'm sure you needn't let the place.
(coyly) There is another way, some deem a duty,
None call unworthy, or would dare to chide.
Women there are, gifted with charm and beauty,
On whom hath Fortune lavished wealth beside
f (Stops, blusliing.)
Sir A. A friend of mine, when we discussed this question,
Made a precisely similar suggestion.
"I am not made like that," I firmly said,
"I but for love alone should ever woo or wed."
Egeria (aside). Ass!
Sir A. (primly). I was gready shocked at his advice,
And murmured hoity-toity once or twice.
Egeria (politely). Your sentiments did you the greatest credit.
I wish I had been present when you said it.
(coquettishly) But are you sure that you will never find
A lady who will make you change your mind?
Sir A. (stiffly). The thing is most unlikely to occur,
And if it does I shall not mention it to her!
Egeria. I see. (rising) Hark! I must hasten home before
The cloud wrack breaks.
Sir A. I'll see you to your door.
May I inquire your homeward footsteps whither?
What? There? It is on Avoncourt estate!
And I by shorter path can guide you thither
Than that you came by, fear you to be late.
[Exeunt by front door.
ACT H.—The Park at Avoncourt, A year has elapsed since
the events of Act I., during which Sir A. has let the
place and gone abroad. On his return he meets EGERIA
by chance.
Sir A. Can it be you! It's twelvemonths since we met.
I've been away, and Avoncourt is let.
Egeria. I know.
Sir A. I 've had a most agreeable year,
Far pleasanter than any I had here.
I crossed the vigilant, unsleeping sea
That ranges round our Isle.
Egeria (impatiently). All this is known to me.
Sir A. (not heeding her) It had meanwhile been leased to
newly wedded
Tenants, unknown to fame but well endowed
With what could rescue it from fate so dreaded
Of slow decay and ruin-mantling shroud.
Egeria (irritably). No one who lives here can be unaware
It wasn't in a good state of repair.
Sir A. And so, to get it put right through and through,
I 've let it to a wealthy parvenu.
Egeria (furious). I 've ne'er been so insulted in my life.
Sir ALURED, I am your tenant's WIFE!
Sir A. You living here! Well then, I beg to state
Your conduct has been most indelicate;
Your whole behaviour disappoints me sadly.
Egeria (sobbing). Yes, yes, I 've treated you extremely badly
Ask me no more, I beg, than what I tell you.

THE TRUST REPOSED IN AN ENGLISHMAN!
[In the July number of the National Review Mr. ABNOLD "WHITE describes
how be w»s recently a giest in the Captain's cabin of a German battleship at
Kiel. "The Captain's private papers," he says, "were lying about. I was
often left aloue, such is the trust reposed in an Englishman."]
I WARRANT you 've heard of ARNOLD WHITE,
Whose duty it is to set things right;
If anyone ventures to doubt A. W.,
Ho '11 frighten you, rouse you, spur you, trouble you,
Still writing away with a zeal Titanic
Till he writes us into a perfect panic
About our country, its wreck and ruin
(Lord ROSEHERY not being up and doin'),
Or about our Navy, its sad condition,
All caused by the grossest exhibition
Of fatuous sloth on the part of Sea-Lords,
Who, to put it plainly, ought not to be Lords—
At any rate not of the Admiraltee,
But should rather be hanged from the nearest tree.
Well, ARNOLD recently went to Kiel,
And lie took liis notes—he 's a right-down chiel—
But, ah, he implies that he cut no capers
With the German Commander's private papers,
Lying about by day or night—
And nobody there but ARNOLD WHITE!
There were German schemes, all open and undone,
For seizing Dover and smashing London;
There were lists made up with a care astounding
Of every channel and shoal and sounding
That a man can find on the billowy main
From Kiel to Portsmouth and back again.
There were plans, signed W., I. et R.,
Showing precisely in knots how far
A ship must sail from the German shore
Before it can sight the man at the Nore;
There were tables of guns, and catalogues stating
The strength of the German armour-plating;
Papers that would have rejoiced, I know,
Our Naval Intelligence Bureau—-
At least I suppose such things lay scattered,
For otherwise it wouldn't have mattered.
By leaving about a washing bill,
A family letter, a lease, a will,
He couldn't have proved himself so apt in
The highest politeness, that German Captain;
So he left what he could of List and Plan
To show that he trusted an Englishman.
Oh, Briton born 'neath a lucky star,
To be trusted so by a German tar,
Think how mighty a privilege this is,
Which everyone but a Briton misses,
To be left, though the sea you 're a perfect dab in,
Alone in a German Captain's cabin!
"Look at their plans ?" you say. "No, bust me!
They know I 'm an Englishman, so they trust me."
"Tis."

HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS.
V.—" THE MATERNAL INSTINCT."
FOR some reason or other—not that it
need be regarded as unnatural—people
seem to be in a hurry to leave Islington
to-night, for the King's Cross trams are
filling up almost as fast as they arrive.
I am forced to take a seat inside. There
is a thin-legged young man opposite in
a collar like a cuff, and exceedingly
narrow trousers, and I notice that he is
having some difficulty in repelling the
advances of his neighbour, an elderly
female bearing a strong resemblance to
Mr. DAN LENO. He has three times
turned a deaf ear to her attempted confi-
dences, and is now rejecting with a some-
what self-conscious hauteur her proffered
bribe of peppermints. The tram, which
appears to be full inside as well as out,
is about to start, when the conductor
earns the resentment of half the inside
passengers by informing somebody in
the road that there is room for one on
the left. Forthwith the entrance is
darkened by a stout lady in a lop-sided
bonnet, unescorted, and joyfully warb-
ling the following wopofior:—
"We'11 all be merry,
Drinkin" whisky, wine an' sherry,
We'11 all be merry
On Coronyetion Dye."
I should hitherto have thought that to
execute a step-dance inside a crowded
tram was a well-nigh impossible feat. The
stout lady, however, performs it with con-
fidence, repeats her chorus, and sits down
heavily next to me. It is borne to my
senses that, whatever may be the stout
lady's proposed menu for Coronation Day,
her choicehas,for this evening at any rate,
fallen upon gin. The occupants of the
tram have been for the most part scan-
dalised at the newcomer; in particular
the thin-legged young man opposite is
staring at her in astonishment. She
returns his gaze.
''All right, BERTIE," she remarks,
defiantly, "yer needn't look at me so
old-fashioned."
The young man, scared at the sudden
publicity thus thrown upon him, red-
dens and looks away. But the elderly
female next to him champions him
immediately.
"And why shouldn't he look old-
fashioned," she returns sturdily, "if
he is old-fashioned?"
This is a startler for the stout lady.
The urbanity of her expression vanishes
immediately, and she directs a cold
stare at the elderly female.
"I wasn't speakin' to you at all,"
she observes, with dignity. "I was
speakin' to that gentleman."
"An" I answered for 'im," returns
the elderly female, cheerfully, "because
I'm 'is mother."
There is something of a sensation in
the tram. Two navvies by the door
show a disposition to applaud. As for
the young man, he gasps and turns an
'ndignant look upon his neighbour.
"I answered for "im," repeats the
elderly female, imperturbably, "because
Vs my son."
The stout lady becomes infinitely
scornful.
'"Im?" she says, with feeling.
"'E ain't no son o' yours."
To endorse this the young man,
who has become the cynosure of all
eyes, attempts to assume as unfilial
an expression as possible, only succeed-
ing in conveying an impression of acute
dyspepsia.
"Yes 'e is," declares the elderly
female good-humouredly—"ain't yer,
sonny?
The young man, very flushed, affects
to be interested in an advertisement.
The stout lady looks towards him com-
passionately.
"Don't you worry, BERTIE," she says;
she don't tike me in. She ain't the
mother o' the likes o' you."
"'E's my son, 'e is," maintains the
elderly female cheerily. "'E wouldn't
disown 'is ole mother what nursed 'im
in 'er arms."
"Chuck it," responds the stout lady
with superb contempt; " 'e ain't no son
o' yours."
The occupants of the tram are patently
splitting up into factions. The larger
side, dominated by the two navvies by
the door, are apparently shocked and
disgusted that the young man should
deny his own mother because she is
'poorly dressed and looks like DAN LENO.
The other faction, probably drawn to-
wards the stout lady out of sympathy
with her Coronation projects, become
the confidants of her further arguments.
"'Er son!" she snorts. "She
wouldn't never 'ave a son to look like
that, not if she lived to be ninety. Look
at 'is gole watch-chine. 'E 's a nob
is. Shave an' a clean collar cv'ry dye?
Not 'arf. One o' the toffs."
The elderly female for her part repeats
her declaration to her own sympathisers,
at the same time looking with astonish-
ing 'good-humour on the young man's
not very flattering agony. From ad-
dressing their respective supporters the
two ladies return to each other, and
the liveliest of debates ensues over the
person of the young man, still reading
advertisements with a face the colour o:
beetroot. Gradually the circle of con
troversy widens. The stout lady is just

her course of action in the contingency
of ever possessing a face like that of her
opponent (who maintains the utmos
cheerfulness throughout), when there is
an interruption.
"Fez, pliz."
The conductor has begun his round,
n due course he arrives at the thin-
egged young man, who fumbles in his
socket for some time, and at last pro-
luces a sovereign and a half-penny. He
ienders the sovereign for a penny fare.
["he conductor eyes him with weary
disgust.
"'Aven't yer got nothing smaller?"
he queries.
The young man has not.
The conductor remarks sourly that he
will have to wait till King's Cross.
~hes the young man take him fcr
BARING RQSSCHILD?
But the stout lady has a word to say
lere. She plucks the conductor's
sleeve.
"That's all right, young man," she
says; "'is mother '11 pye for "im."
A flutter of triumph pervades the
stout lady's faction. But they have
underestimated the amount of spirit in
the elderly female. She hands the con-
ductor sixpence.
"Two," she observes genially; "me
an' my son."
Jubilation of the elderly female's
faction, confusion of their opponents,
and scarlet protest on the part of the
young man.
"Two," repeats the elderly female;
to Clerkenwell."
The conductor lowers his bundle of
tickets.
"Where d'yer wanter go to?" he
demands stob'dly.
"Me an' my boy to Clerkenwell,"
benms the elderly female.
The conductor forces the coin back
into her hand, strides down to the door
and jerks the bell.
'Come on," he calls wearily; '' you 're
goin' away from Clerkenwell."
Jubilation of the stout lady and her
faction. The elderly female leaves the
car in the best of spirits, after an un-
successful attempt to kiss the thin-
legged young man. The conductor
stands with his hand on the bell-cord.
;Are yer goin' on?" he calls im-
patiently to the young man.
"What are you waiting for? " snaps
the latter, very red in the face. "Of
course I'm"
Ting!
The stout lady exults loudly. She is
interrupted soon by the conductor ring-
ing the bell.
"Gumming Street," he announces
impolitely; "come on!"
"Don't you worry, BERTIE," she
observes protectively. "She never kid-
ded me."
"Come on, if yer comin'!" calls the
conductor.
The stout lady makes her way to the
door, resuming her monarchical ode on
the step:

There is peace, save for the clink,

TO YOUNG YACHTSMEN.
HAVING just returned from my first—
and, I trust, last—trip on a friend's
yacht, I am enabled, with the experience
born of long suffering and acute ag
observation, to evolve a few simple rules
for the guidance of those who rashly
meditate following my example. It was
a steady calm from the N.W. when I
got on board, and my host welcomed
me genially as I fell up the steps on to
the deck. I apologised for my clumsi-
ness by saying that I had had no ex-
perience of yachting.
The skipper—a gloomy man—looked
up at the black cloud hovering over-
head, and remarked grimly:
"Ah, you '11 get plenty o' that, Sir,
before to-morrow."
Rather discouraging.
But the skipper was right: and when,
that afternoon, we were plunging bow-
sprit under, with our rudder feebly
waving in the air, I remembered the
ominous words with a groan.
"This is jolly, old man, isn't it?"
exclaimed my host, BACKSTAY, cheerily
patting me on the back—a most unwise
proceeding, as it almost immediately
proved.
I answered faintly, "Oh yes, it was
awfully jolly," and asked "When were
we likely to reach harbour?" BACKSTAY
replied:
"We '11 get down to Portland and
bring up there."
Horrid! I wish people wouldn't talk
like this on board a yacht. So thought-
less of them.
» a » e
The storm blew itself out that night,
and the remaining three days of my
stay, we had light breezes only. During
that time I was able to glean much
nautical information, and to write these
plain directions for the use of my fellow-
su f—sportsmen.
1. Praise everything connected with
the yacht you are on, and always dis-
parage every other you see.
2. If on a sailing vessel, allude con-
temptuously to steam yachts as "tea-
kettles," "coal-hulks," or "steam-
rollers."

"SANCTA SIMPLICITAS."
First Lady. "ABE NOT THESE PICTURES B«AUTIFPL?"
Second Lady. "Yw. AND I WONDER HOW THEY OAK POSSIBLY DO IT FOR A SHILLING!"
3. If on a steam-yacht, never omit to
speak of a sailing vessel in pitying
tones as an old "wind-jammer."
4. Take care not to get out of your
depth in using nautical terms. Why
should one feel so friendly towards
cabin-stairs as to call them '' com-
panions"? As a rule repeat expres-
sions used bv sailor-men—beg pardon,
"hands."
N.B. — Curious fancy picture sug-
gested by tb.9 term "hands." All
mariners aboard are only "hands with
sea-legs on!" Weird!
5. A yawl is the most mystifying of all
rigs to understand. It has a bowsprit
at each end, and confusing these two
would inevitably end in sorrow.
6. It is rude to lean one's elbows on
any dinner table. On a swinging table
it is not only rude but disastrous.
I cannot more usefully conclude these
directions than by giving a brief glos-
sary of the terms most in use aboard,
together with their translation into the
vernacular.
"Borspret" means bowsprit.
"Main-sheet" has nothing to do with
the bedclothes, but signifies a rope
attached to the boom (at least that
is my present impression).
"Torps'l" means the thing they hoist
on to the extreme summit of the
mast.
"Gig" means, not a two-wheeled ve-
hicle, but a boat.
"Rotten old tank" means someone
else's yacht.
"I-must-just-go-below-and-see-the-
steward" means a whiskey and
soda.

[Mr. PUNCH is unable to publish all the corre-

Coronation liabilities. The following are sample*.]
DEAR SIR,—Re Coronation Seats. I
think in such matters there should l:e
give and take. I am quite prepared to
take.—Yours, Ac., A SEATHOLDER.
DEAR SIR,—In this question of the
seats, let us consider what His MAJESTY
himself would have done. He is gene-
rous. I feel sure he would have decided
to refund the money to the seatholders.
Yours, &c., A SEATHOI.DEU.
DEAR SIR,—What would His MAJESTY'S
wish have been in respect of the seats?
There can be no doubt. He would
surely have said to the seatholders, " Be
generous and pay the money." Let us
be guided by this.—Yours, &c.,
A SrAXD-OwNER.
DEAR SIR,—All right-minded persons
must agree that litigation in the cir-
cumstances would be unseemly. Let
the owners of the stands give us back
our money at once.—Yours, &c., PAX.
SIR,—If the stand-owners won't pay
up, sue them.—Yours, &c.,
A BARRISTER.
[We have received a similar letter
signed "A SOLICITOR."]
DEAR SIR,—I offered a free luncheon
to all persons who took my seats, and,
at the time of the postponement, the
luncheon was already on the premises. I
wish to announce that I shall keep it for
them until the Coronation takes place.
Trusting that the present hot weather
may soon cease, Yours, Ac.,
K. TERER.
SIR,—In my opinion this wrangling
over the seats is disgusting. I would
make both sides pay. I would force
the seat-holder to pay the stand-owner,
and force the stand-owner to refund to
the seat-holder. That would be a good
lesson to both. Yours, &c.,
A LOYAL IRISHMAN.
SIR,—Here is everyone anxious to
have legal advice. Your solicitors tell
me they have not been doing wonder-
fully well this year. They do not
deserve to do well. Enterprise with
them seems dead. Why did they not,
on the morning after the postponement
was announced, line the pavement in
Chancery Lane and offer advice at
moderate rates to all passers-by? Wake
up, England. Yours, &c.,
AN AMERICAN.
DEAR SIR,—I bought ten seats at £5
each for my family. I am a poor man.
It will be hard if I have to pay.
Yours, &c., ^5;ERITAS.
DEAR SIR,—I bought some seats at a
draper's shop where I have been a
customer for many years past. The
man now refuses to give me back my
money. I am so indignant that I have
half a mind never to deal at his shop
again. Anyhow, I would like him to
know that the only reason why I con-
tinue to patronise him is that' he is
cheaper than anyone else.
Yours, &c. CAROLINE FLINT.
DEAR MR. EDITOR,—A few months ago
I bought, at a sale, a Union Jack hand-
kerchief, a Union Jack ribbon for my
hat, a Union Jack blouse, a pair of
Union Jack shoes, and a Union Jack
air-cushion—and a. Union Jack. It is
true I did not in so many words say
they were for the Coronation, but one
does not wear such things on ordinary
days, does one? I presume I can force
the shop to take them back? If not, I
would really like to know what is the
use of the Law.
Yours, &c. ELIZABLTH JANE.
DEAR SIR,—I had arranged with a
cabman to take me down to my seat for
£3. He did not turn up. Please let
me know this: Am I not entitled to
damages against him for breaking his
contract? Yours, &c. JUSTITU.
DEAR SIR,—I asked several poor rek-
tions to my house for the Coronation.
They refuse to leave till the Coronation

not unfamiliar incident.
Bird, beast and flower proclaim the hour,
But where U COUNTY GUT?
Situation critical. LORD HIGH CHAN-
CELLOR, advancing with pomp of such
circumstance as Black Rod and Purse
Bearer, took seat on Woolsack at a
quarter past four. Public business in
Lords does not commence till 4.30.
Interval spent either in meditation
or in advancing private Bills. To-day
no private business to fore. Accordingly
meditation prevailed; in the sultry
afternoon air it was occasionally sugges-
tive of forty winks. Few to share the
luxury. Muster of nine all told.
"Odd," murmured SARK, his eye
lingering on the Woolsack; "that's
just the number of the Muses."
In the Commons situation would
have been seized to put Ministers in a
hole. As soon as Educational Board

Bill was reached, Opposition would
have challenged division and given
Ministers a shock. Such low tactics
well enough in the Commons; don't
suit the Lords. Besides, it was too hot.
his place. Fortunately DUDLEY on
guard, primed with particulars about
Oyster and Mussel Fishery, with which
second Order of Day was concerned.
He moved that the House resolve itself
into Committee on the Educational Bill.
LORD CHANCELLOR put question.
Now was the time for Opposition to
strike. Aggregate number had run up
to eleven. Counting heads, LORD CHAN-
CELLOR observed that in case of instant
division Government would be in
minority of two. Must dissemble.
Having put the question he hurriedly
declared, "The Contents have it";
with remarkable agility hopped two
paces to right of Woolsack; Chair-
man of Committees popped into chair
at Table; and before TWEEDMOUTH, who
had now come in to take his seat on
deserted Front Bench, had completec
hasty review of situation, the Bill was
through.
Then came the Oyster and Musse
Fishery Bill. As Parliamentary Secre-
tary to the Board of Trade, WILLIAM
HUMBLE WARD, second Earl of DUDLEY
in charge of this important measure
Born and brought up in the Midlands
a district unfrequented by the mussel,
where the oyster is familiar only in
certain months of the year (when it
arrives in small casks, usually holding
one hundred), DUDLEY lacked that inti-
mate knowledge of the subject that
s at the bottom of all Parliamentai y
success. Still it was an enticing occa-
sion, not lightly to slip through
ambitious fingers. True the attendance
was not large. But the hour was early.
_n the Press Gallery the ear of the
universe was alert, attentive.
Though ranking among Under Secre-
aries, the fortune of the hour gave the
Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of
Trade supreme position. He was sole
representative in the House of the
strongest Ministry of modern times, one
that had just concluded a great war,
signed a memorable peace. WALDEQRAVF.
lad, for company's sake, dropped into
i seat near him. That was merely
,he ingrained habit of a former Lord-
n-Waiting. WALDEGRAVE was Waiting
to go home, and the Ministerial Bencli
s nearer to the door than most others.
With the recklessness of comparative
youth DUDI.EY resolved to seize oppor-
tunity by the hair. The Oyster and
\l usscl Bill called on he rose; drew
limself to his full height.
"My Lords," he said, "the world is
nine oyster, and with this"
Here the LORD CHANCELLOR turned
upon him an awful frown.
"No, really, you Mussel — I mean
you'd better not," said WAIDEGRAVE,
tugging at his coat-tail.
DUDLEY hesitating, LORD CHANCELLOR
in a breath observed "Question-is-that-
this-Bill-be-read-a-third-time—Those-of-
that - opinion- say-Content-the-contrary-
Not-Content—The-ContentB-have^it.''
This the end of appointed business of
the day. There followed pained pause.
It was the duty of the Minister to move
the adjournment. DUDLEY'S nerves so
shaken with the little contretemps that
he made no sign. At this critical
moment the DOOK, his right hand
deeply set in his trouser pocket, strolled
in, looking exactly as he did when going
through the private rehearsals in the
Abbey for the Coronation ceremony. Of
course he did not wear his coronet,
which in the Abbey looked a trifle in-
congruous with morning dress. But he
had the same bored look.
His lethargy only apparent. In an in-
stant he seized the situation; quickened
his step; seated himself on Front Bench
whispered a word to the still comatose
second EARL OF DUDLEY; on his feet
In a voice distinctly heard in all parts
of the Chamber he said, "I move that

has been no such transformation scene
as hereupon happed. AJ1 the long pen-
stream of life dashed downward in i
cataract. The eleven Peers scattcrec
over the benches rose and made for the
door. The clerks at the Table swept
heaps of papers into swiftly-opened
drawers. The LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR
strode forth with trailing robe. The
House of Lords had sat for two minutes
by Westminster clock, and was now
adjourned.
Business done.—Commons pegging
away at Education Bill.
House of Commons, Ttiesday.—Two
thunderstorms to-day. In mid-after-
noon the midsummer sky grew so black
that gas was turned on. Presently,
through windows opened to sultry air,
the thunder rolled. PRINCE ARTHUR'S
explanation of fresh amendment to
Clause 3 of Education Bill illumined
with flashes of lightning that shamed
the steady glare of the gas-lit ceiling.
This pretty well in its way: nothing
to storm that burst when, seven hours
later, WALTER LONG moved closure on
question that Clause 3 stand part of
the Bill. C.-B. aghast with indignation.
Why, they 'd been talking about the
Clause for only fifty minutes, when comes
President Local Government Board with
abhorred shears and slits the thin-spun
thread of conversation. A nice calcula-
tion; but omitted to take note of fact
that five weary hours of a so-called
summer afternoon had been earlier
spent on this very Clause. Opposition
in rare tantrum. Returning from
Division Lobby, where Clause was
carried by rattling majority of 144,
C.-B. moved to report progress. CHAIR-

abuse of the rules of the House,
straightway put question without per-
mitting debate.
The closure was whips; this was
scorpions. Never before was Leader of
Opposition dealt with in such drastic
"ashion. After moment of pained
silence Opposition broke forth into
lowls of despairing remonstrance. No
ippeal from judgment of Chairman;
10 opportunity even of discussing it.
Driven forth into Lobby again, Opposi-
tion reduced the Ministerial majority to
88; a poor consolation, but their own.
The varying figures due to action of
Irish Members, who spent an hour of
delirious delight. In ordinary divisions
on Education. Bill their privilege is
limited to voting against their nominal
allies, the Liberals. By promise of
State subvention of Roman Catholic
schools they are bought over to the
Government side. Must go into same
Lobby with CHIEF SECRETARY and
JOHNSTON OF BALLTKILBEO. But on
questions of hampering Government in
respect of closure and motions to report
progress their hands are free. Joyfully
use them to clutch His Majesty's
Ministers by the throat.
Business done.—Leader of Opposition
sharply snubbed.
Thursday niglit.—The long-cherished
desire of the MAHARAJAH of KOLHAPUR is
fulfilled. Dwelling in a far country,
under quite other skies, his heart ever
fondly turned to Westminster, where
the House of Commons, stately mother
of a world-compelling brood, sits in
calm majesty.
At this moment the MAHARAJAH is
perched in the Diplomatic Gallery,
filling all liis senses with delight. A
colossal personage his Highness; arrayed
in white burnous of soft material
flecked with gold lace; over his monu-
mental, dusky, alert head is folded a
turban of dainty blue. House in Com-
mittee of Supply. Foreign Office Vote

The very occasion on which His High-
ness has meditated, expecting to see the
Chamber thronged, palpitating with
emotion, whilst two hemispheres timidly
watch at the door wondering what
England is going to do to them next.
What the MAHARAJAH looks down upon
is an array of beggarly benches with
here and there a member. CHARLES

The MAHARAJAH disillusioned, and, not catching all
DILKE'S remarks, said he thought he would go on to the
House of Lords, where he spent a pleasant half-hour listen-
ing to WELBY discoursing on the Com Tax.

interesting afternoon," said the MAHARAJAH, bending a
beaded eye on the hapless member for the Cleveland Divi-
sion of York, who was more than ever glad he didn't
happen to be in Kolhapur.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Saturday, June 28.—Excellent performance of LEON-
CAVALLO'S Pagliacei. Fraulein SCHEFF unable to appear, the
queer weather having played the mis-scheffi with her voice.
May she speedily recover! MUe. AURELIE REVY at short
notice played and sang Nedda excellently. Signor Scorn's
Tonic was all that could be wished; and everybody was in
a cheerier frame of mind than on Thursday the 26th, when a
gloom was over the nation, and Opera and opera-habitues
were under the cloud of the KINO'S illness. But now the
doctors are men of " good report," and all are sanguine; so
singers and audience alike are bright, and Madame CALV& as
Santuzza in MASCAGNI'S Cavalleria Rusticana is at her very
best, dramatically and vocally. Signor CAEUSO grand in the
part of Turiddu; the drinking song magnificently sung,
and the encore, unanimously demanded, is accorded by
Signor MANCINELLI. But the one refrain that everyone is
humming hopefully as we leave the Opera is " God Save the
Kira!"
Thursday.—" The Garden Party at the Opera," which is,
of course, Mr. WAQSTAFF'S exceedingly humorous way of
describing the debut of Miss GARDEN as the capricious heroine
of Manon, grand opera in four acts, music by MASSENET,
libretto by Messrs. MEILHAO and GILLE, from Abbe" PREVOST'S
well-known romance. Miss GARDEN achieved an unqualified
success. This deponent could write an essay on "Marions
I have seen," some excellent in one way, and some in
another; but this lady, the latest representative of the fickle
flirt who ends as the contrite coquette, is "very Manon."
As the character develops itself, from being "only a country
girl," shamming simplicity, up to the full-blown fashionable
courtesan, in a kind of female " Rake's Progress " from maid
to mistress, and then falling from her high estate to the lowli-
ness of a repentant Magdalen, Miss GARDEN, as actress and
singer, leaves nothing to be desired. From first to last she
is Manon, and in this part at least her triumph is assured.
M. MARECHAL as the Chevalier Des Grieux, whose weari-
some sentimentality is some excuse for Manon's conduct
towards him, was excellent, rather as operatically singing
than histrionically speaking. The three Larky Ladies or
Three Disgraces, Ponsette, Rosette, Javotte, found charmingly
sprightly and most harmonious representatives in Miles.
HELIAN, McCur.ijOCH, and MAUDOURO. As Miss GARDEN (hence-
forth Miss COVENT GARDEN) hails from the land of Lucia
di Lammermoor, it must be pleasant to her, coming as a
stranger to our little village, to find a compatriot in that
wee bonnie Hieland lassie Miss McCcLLOCH ' of that ilk.'
M. ALLARD is a good and tuneful Lescaut; not, perhaps,
quite enough of the rollicking bully, but 'tis easy to ove.r-
colour such a picture, and his discretion is the better part
of his value in this character.
Perfect PLANCON is the Pere Noble to the life. Of course,
like Old Germont in La Traviata, he has bought his experi-
ence and knows his way about, rather! Even now this "Awful
Dad," as played by Perfect PLANCON, would be an awkward
rival to his own dear boy, and if he only let himself go it is
impossible not to feel that that arch little humbug Manon
would go with him some considerable way. M. GILIBERT, as
the fooush, fat, and fond nobleman who turns uncommonly
nasty when he loses his money, is excellent.
Altogether a distinguished success for everybody con-
cerned, including M. PH. FLON (which, when pronounced,
sounds as if you were stammering with plums in your
mouth) and his gallant orchestra, the curtains being opened
and reclosed again and agnin after every Act in order to
satisfy the vociferous demands of a delighted audience,
determined, when there was no more to be heard, to see as
much as possible of the artistes who, hand in hand, all
"bop'd and boo'd and boo'd" like so many smiling Sir
Pertinaxes; which reference is quoted as apt on account
of the Caledonian nationality of the prima donna, Miss
McMANON. At Miss CHARMING GARDEN'S next appearance her
admirers in the house will all take care to decorate themselves
with Gardenias and Scotch heather-bloom. This flower
show will give the hot house (cooled by occasional blasts
from the Vonderful Ventilators) a distinguished, noble, and
decidedly haughty-cultural appearance. Miss GARDEN will,
of course, be the subject of many a " mot."
P.S.—In my last I referred to the production of L'Elislr
d'Amore with the great LABLACHE in the cast. The date of
this, I am informed by a trustworthy correspondent, was
1841, and in that same season was given I Puritani at Her
Majesty's, before Covent Garden was started as the opposi-
tion, with GRISI, ROBINI, TAMBURINI, and LABLACHE. "Fancy
that!" But this deponent was then among the talented
Squallini Family in the Domestic Nursery Grounds.
OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
IN The Roll Call of Westminster Abbey (Suns, ELDER)
Mrs. MURRAY SMITH has accomplished a labour of love.
Familiar with every stone of the historic fane, she personally
conducts the reader round it, chatting pleasantly of the
monuments, nearly every one summarising a chapter in
English history. An immense amount of toil has been
bestowed upon the task, and infinite erudition is displayed
in its accomplishment. A concurrent gift necessary to
success is that of judicious condensation. My Baronite
testifies that this also is in Mrs. MURRAY SMITHES quiver.
The value of the volume is increased by a number of
illustrations of the more memorable tombs, and a set of
carefully prepared plans of the interior of the Cathedral.
A Double-Barrelled Detective Story (CHATTO & WINDUS)
carries with it assurance that MARK TWAIN is still fancy-free,
and that his hand has not lost its cunning. There is some-
thing almost terrible in the earlier incidents of the story,
with its weird development in the person of the son of the
outraged wife. The narrative is relieved by many touches of
MARK'S inimitable humour. A dramatic surprise is reserved
for the last. The worst thing about the book is its brevity.
Nevertheless—or, to put it in another way, therefore—my
Baronite strongly recommends it as companion for a railway
journey, say two hours long. TUB BARON DE B.-W.

LLANDAFTNESS.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,—I observe that
Lord LLAXDAFF has been writing to the
Times, giving hints upon the manage-
ment of antliropoid apes.
Profiting by his lordship's excellent
example, I propose to address a few
remarks to you, Sir, upon the subject of
that entertaining anthropoid, the com-
mon, parodist (poietes mimetikos). My
acquaintance with the variety is not
limited, like Lord LLANDAFF'S, to mere
observation, but is intimate and even
personal, as I am myself distantly

related to the genus. I speak therefore
with as much knowledge as freedom.
These elegant animals (classed zoologi-
cally with the cynocephali, as showing
some distinct "sign o' brain") are really
quite easy to keep, though sometimes
difficult to lose. It is true that in
England they are more delicate than in
some other countries, but even here
they have been known to become hardy
to the point of irreverence. They are
best kept in cages, and under the con-
trol of an able-bodied keeper, but there
is no harm in allowing them to exercise
their tricks—which in the case of the
larger specimens are frequently very
amusing—when restraint threatens to
endanger their health. The cages need
little straw, for it is one of the chief
elements of their usefulness that they
can make bricks with the merest
modicum of that material; but a cheap
scaffolding—the commoner the better—
of familiar subjects should be erected
in each cage.
All indiscriminate feeding should be
strenuously discouraged, as in practice
it is found that the public often in this
way stimulates the least deserving to a
display of their energies. Regular
meals, however, are of the utmost im-
portance, and in my opinion should be
provided by the editor or other keeper
himself; for they are naturally vora-
cious and, if kept too hungry, will
sometimes weaken their system in the
endeavour to assimilate unsuitable
material. Water should be given only
sparingly: they are apt to splash it
about amongst their ideas, which do
not always stand further dilution.
Heat is a sine qud non. On this
account some authorities recommend ice
and others liquid air, but these are
both heresies. Personally I think the
temperature of Uouverie Street (perhaps
slightly raised by the warmth of your
reception of uninvited hints) eminently
suitable. In this belief allow me to
subscribe myself,
Yours obediently,
SIMIAN SCRIBBLER.

".... I cannot too strongly
nsist on the necessity of in-
brmation. A journalist need
not always be well, but he must
be plenteously, informed. If he
can detect the line between in-
formation and imagination, so
much the better, for he will then
be able to conceal it. He must
•xlso be able to discriminate, for
:here are tunes when different
kinds of information, intrinsi-
cally of equal value in them-
selves, have a different face value
as regards the public. For in-
stance, let me put the case that
a journalist has ascertained:
a. That the French army is
landing at Dover; b. That an
enormous gooseberry has been
found in Cheshire. From the
point of view of the journalist
these facts are equally impor-
tant, but—and here is the diffi-
culty—he must be able to detect
which has the more immediate
interest for the public. One of
them is worth a column, the
other merely a note, and with
his hand on the public pulse he
must find out which to empha-
sise. Public taste varies, and it
may be that on a Monday it will
be interested in the French army,
while on a Thursday it may pre-
fer to read about the gooseberry . . . ."
Lecture on Social Topics.
".... It is impossible to overesti-
mate the value of a duchess. She is
always worth mentioning, even if there
is no apparent reason for doing so.

a shop, say so. A quarter of a column
at the least. ..."

". . . . Music and art are things
which come naturally to a journalist.
Remember that TSCHAIKOWSKY is the
embodied spirit of modern unrest,

quote. The Royal Academy • exhi-
bition of any given year is not

SHYLOCK AND THE POUND OF SOUL.
(Reflections on the Education Bill Debates.)
DEAR human child, whose woolly head
Closely recalls the unwearied lamb;
You with the lips whose native red
Is stained with inexpensive jam;
0 virgin soil, 0 plastic clay
Within the primary potter's grip,
To whom, for moulding, day by day
So unsuspectingly you trip;
When I remark the limits set
About your elemental lore,
As that from two and two you get
A total tantamount to four ;—
When I perceive your nascent nerve
Engrossed with dates of Britain's Kings,
The pothook's iterated curve,
And other non-contentious things;—
1 fondly hope you never dream
That your prospective moral state
Still constitutes the steady theme
Of loud and* bellicose debate.
It lies, I trust, outside your ken
That nightly, till the senses reel,
Six hundred heated Christian men
Wrestle for your immortal weal.
Yes, when on Heaven's name they call
And knock each other's doctrines flat,
You are their object; it is all
On your account, unconscious brat!
Summer will pass, and Winter's hand
Of dying Autumn take his toll,
And still, like SHYLOOKS, they will stand,
Claiming their punctual pound of soul.
I wonder, should you come to know
The facts about this deadly feud,
Whether your little heart would go
And burst with speechless gratitude;
Or rather, being made aware
What means they use to reach their ends,
You would compose a tiny prayer
To be delivered from your friends;
And crave permission of the star
That on your recent advent smiled
Just to continue what you are —
A simple, bounding, heathen child.

Miss ATHEHTON, attracted by the strong per-
sonality of the American statesman ALEXANDER
HAMILTON, whom TALLEYRAND ranked with
NAPOLEON and Fox, placing him at the head
of the trio, determined to write his bio-
graphy. No sooner did she take pen in
hand than, as she confesses, she determined
to make the book a novel, whilst preserving
the accuracy of detail befitting a biography. It is an attrac-
tive idea. But the measure of success attained in The
Conqueror (MAOMILLAN) will not inspire imitation. No man
or woman either) can in the same volume serve the two
masters of biography and fiction. Miss ATHERTON has met
the proverbial fate of the adventurous person who attempts
to sit on two stools. She has come to the ground with a
somewhat tiresome book. The reader is bewildered and
repelled by the continuous difficulty of deciding which page
or paragraph is fiction and which biography. In the midst
of a lengthy matter-of-fact description of difficulties in con-
nection with the framing of a Constitution for the emanci-
pated Colonies, my Baronite comes upon the following:—
"What imperious method are you devising, HAMILTON?"
asked LIVINGSTON. "Your lips are set, your eyes are almost
black. I have seen you like that in Court, but never in
good company before. You look as if considering a chal-
lenge to mortal combat." The best passages in the book
are descriptions of sea and land by HAMILTON'S birthplace
in the West Indies. And that is neither biography nor
fiction. "To which sentiment of my Baronite's, 'Ditto'"
says THE BAKON DE BOOK-WORMS.
CHACUN A SON GOUT.
[According to the Daily Chronicle's report of an interview with NAWAB
FATEH An KHAN of the Punjab, what the NAWAB most admires in thii
country is its excellent climate.]
IN the chamber of gold I have listened with awe
To the voice of your great legislators,
And my feelings were mightily moved when I saw
Episcopal aprons and gaiters.
I thought what a wonderful scene this affords,
The throne and the robes of the Primate— •
But though I was vastly impressed with the Lords—
They were nothing, I thought, to the climate.
The War Office, too, I have seen. What a sight!
What a triumph of organisation!
Ah! well may it be the commercial deb'ght
Of a business-like, shop-keeping nation!
I was lost in admiring its wonderful ways,
But of course, though the system 's sublime, it
By no means is worthy the tribute of praise
Which I bring to your temperate climate.
I 've visited Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's,
And Ascot and Henley; I 've been to
The Opera, plays by the dozen and Halls;
The Zoo and the Waxworks I 've seen too.
But in all (I must draw to a close, for I find
It is growing less easy to rhyme it)
I came upon nothing so much to my mind
As your wonderful, temperate climate.

MY NEIGHBOUR,
NEXT door the summer roses bloom
And breathe their hearts out day by
day
To please a gentle gardener whom
Twere happiness to thus obey:
For her each rose a fragrance gives
That roses grudge to common labour,
And there, next door, among them lives
My neighbour.
I watch her in her garden fair,
And think what joy my life would
bless
Could ahe and I but wander there,
A shepherd and a shepherdess,
As blithe as those of ancient myth
That danced and sang to pipe and
tabor:
Who would not thus be happy with
My neighbour?
Blue eyes, and hair of sunny brown,
A form of such exceeding grace,
And features in whose smile and frown
Such tender beauty I can trace
That here to sketch her free from flaw
Defies the pencil of a FABER,
And yet I yearn so much to draw
My neighbour!
I 'm keeping one commandment—an
Epitome of all the ten—
So if I, when my life began,
Was born in sin like other men,
To innocence that shames the dove,
I 've mellowed since I was a babe, or
How could I so devoutly love
My neighbour?

Mus. Doc. (beaming). Capital, capital!
And what do you say to going for a

First High Official. But, my dear General, if, as you
suggest, the Highland regiments were to wear top-hats,
only think of the very undesirable effect that a shower of
rain would produce!
Second H. 0. My dear Colonel, you misunderstand me.
I never suggested that the hats should be made of silk.
Now, hats of a shiny material, such as those affected by
bus-drivers, or even opera hats, would, I take it, add very
greatly to their general effect on parade. But whom have
we here? (Fiercely to Nervous Inventor.) Your business,
Sir?
Nervous Inventor. I ventured to intrude, gentlemen, with
the plans of a new gun which
First H. 0. (interrupting). While on the subject of hats,
General, perhaps you have.not seen the latest pattern served
out to the Kamschatkan Light Infantry. It is something
after this style.
[He sketches the new Kamschatkan cap on the back of an
unopened letter marked " urgent." Twenty minutes
are spent in discussing the relative merits of the top-
hat and the Kamschatkan cap in all their bearings."]
Second H. 0. Well, Colonel, we must thresh out this
important matter at our leisure. Now, Sir (to Nervous
Inventor), we must beg you not to waste more of our
valuable time than is absolutely necessary. Once more,
what is it that you want?
N. I. As I was saying, gentlemen, I venture to bring
before your notice a new gun which I have just completed.
Worked as it is by electric power, the gunner has only to
touch a button
First H. 0. A propos of buttons, General, I hardly feel
that the button you designed for the Third Life Guards is
calculated to maintain the traditions of the British Army.
I am certain that it would be infinitely more effective, not
to say artistic, if its diameter were increased by a thirty-
second of an inch.
Second H. 0. No, no, my dear Colonel. The change you
propose would, to my mind, ruin the general effect of the
uniform. Now, if you had suggested a decrease of a
sixteenth of an inch
[For twenty minutes they discuss the knotty question of
buttons for the Second Life Guards, without arriving
at any definite conclusion.']
First H. 0. (to N. I.}. Now, Sir, you have wasted nearly
an hour of our valuable time, and if you have anything
further to tell us we would beg of you to do so at once.
N. I. (tlioroughly exasperated). Well, gentlemen, I had
intended to describe to you, with the aid of diagrams, the
size of the breaches which my gun would make in the walls
of any town that you happened to be besieging. But as I
know that the mere mention of the word would be sufficient
to give rise to a discussion as to whether knee-breeches
should be included in the mess kit of regiments in the field,
what should be their colour, material and cut, whether they
should be fastened above or below the knee, with gold,
silver, platinum, or pewter buckles, and whether they should
be terminated with button boots, lace boots, shoes with
buckles, shoes without buckles, sandals, clogs, pattens, or
buskins, I feel that it would be a waste of breath. Good
morning.
First and Second H. 0. (aghast). Well, the impertinence
of these inventors passes all bounds! And after we had
given him so much of our valuable time, too!
[They fall back into easy chairs, and, after lighting tJieir
cigarettes with a plan of the latest thing in rifles,
they soon become immersed in the pages of the

OPERATIC NOTES.
Wednesday, July 9.—La Princesse Osra (music by HERBEBT
BUNKING to a French libretto by MAURICE BERENQER, adapted
to English understandings by R. H. ELKIN, the plot being
found for them by ANTHONY HOPE in his Heart of Princess
Osra, so that the opera, as announced, is Princesse Osra
without her heart) was to have been produced to-night. But
the Princess wasn't ready, and so she may perhaps appear
before thesa notes see daylight; anyway, too late for Mr.
Punch's Operatic Representative to say anything about her
in this present number. So instead of the Princess we greet
Signora Lucia di Lammermoor.
In consequence, perhaps, of the Princesse Osra being
absent, the house was by no means inconveniently crowded.
And the absentees lost, as I am informed (your Representa-
tive being, like the Princess, unavoidably prevented from
re-presenting himself), a great treat by not witnessing the
performance of Mile. REGINA PACINI, who, good throughout,
was especially strong in the mad scene, receiving an enthu-
siastic encore. Mile. BAUERMEISTER as Alice, not "in
Wonderland," was the heroine's sympathetic confidante,
who could safely advertise as "companion" to any lady,
and be perfectly certain not jnly of immediately obtaining a
situation, but of giving the most complete satisfaction.

And carefully selected diet?
Sweet EDITH married! Cruel fate!
No other news could stir such feeling
(Just as I 'd had my opiate
And felt a languor o'er me stealing).
It tears my heart strings. Really,
FRED,
I think you might have recollected
My pericardium is said
To be the very part affected.
Alas for EDITH! It was she
Who won my love that last December
When I was ordered to Torquay—
(A lung was faulty, you remember).
I used to lend her my bath-chair,
She liked the arms — my own in-
vention;
I let SMITH push her anywhere,
And lost myself his whole attention.
I never knew a better nurse,
She wheeled her father any weather,
Always remarked when he was worse,
And watched him doze for hours to-
gether.
I loved her, FRED, I love her still;
I should have put the fatal question
If she had had the slightest skill
In paroxysmal indigestion.
I hoped in no far distant days
Her father, or some near connection,
Might fall into dyspeptic ways,
And so remove the sole objection.

STERN REALITIES!
THE Hippodrome has surely out-
Heroded Herod as regards realism, for
we are told that in its "new sensa-
tion" "real" horses and "real" people
are swept away by a "real" torrent of
water. Verily the modern actor in such
vivid representations must be a hardy
fellow! We may shortly expect some-
thing of this kind to be announced as
an attraction:— ''•
In the forthcoming Prehistoric Melo-
drama, the gentleman who plays the part
of Ichthy O'Saurua will be clubbed in
the third act with a real stone axe.
To guard against disappointment to the
public several understudies will be
provided by the Management.
At the Blankville Theatre a real
soda-water bottle will be broken on
the villain's skull in the race-course
scene.
The heroine, in the new society drama
about to be produced, will positively be
thrown across the orchestra into the
front row of the stalls. Every evening
at 8, matinees 2.30 Saturdays.
Real swords will be used in the duel
scene in the new opera, and the tenor
or baritone will probably be wounded
each evening.
N.B. Nothing to hurt: a mere "pin
prick" to make the vocalist, if tired,
sing out a bit.
The Management of the Vivacity
Theatre, not to be outdone in the rage
for realism, have provided their patrons
with a genuine surprise. In the Tropical
Island scene, real pythons and boa
constrictors will wreathe themselves
about the stage, and possibly escape
into the auditorium; whilst, should the
weather be tropical, the firemen who rush
on to extinguish, the fire in the Liverpool
warehouse (Act IV.) will be instructed
to turn the hoses on to the orchestra
and the first three rows of the stalls.

["The invasion of London by wild country life
makes progress annually. You may roam many
miles of rural hill and dale without seeing timid
birds, such as magpies and moorhens, living their
wild natural life on such close and easy terms as
in St. James's Park."— Country Life.}
Chorus of Country Birds:
SWEET, oh sweet the Surrey lanes,
Where the wild rose blushes;
Sweet the thicket filled with strains
Sung by tuneful thrushes;
Sweet the lakelet when the West
Rains upon it golden rest,
And the moorhen builds her nest
Deep among the rushes.
But behind the rosy bower
Stalks a ruthless ranger,
Seeking whom he may devour—
Save us from the stranger!
While upon the lakelet fair
Lo, the fowler sets his snare—
Cruel mau is everywhere
Dealing death and danger.
Chorus of Town Birds:
Leave, oh leave your Surrey lanes,
Where the wild rose blushes!
Fill this Eden with your strains,
0 ye tuneful thrushes!
Moorhens, here are havens blest
Where your little ones may rest—
Undisturbed shall be your nest
Deep among the rushes.
Round about this shady bower
Lingers many a ranger;
But we need not flee nor cower—
Here we fear no stranger.
Never on this lakelet fair
Does the fowler set his snare—
Friendly man is everywhere
Guarding us from danger.
Omnea:
Empty are the Surrey lanes,
Where the wild rose blushes;
In the thicket ring no strains
Sung by tuneful thrushes.
But St. James's now may see
Fowl of high and low degree—
Magpies build in every tree,
Moorhens in the rushes.

summer afternoon, when everyone is
taking a siesta or is sitting in thi

foliage of the magnolias and acacias, al
gleaming in the southern sunshine; if
on such an afternoon, you should per

nay know that the man, or woman, has

It is, in fact, a tremendous under-
diking. The Monastery seems at no
jreat distance on the map, but you
lave to go all round it and start from
he other side, wherever you begin.
Some enthusiasts go the whole way by
road, which saves mental wear and
ear, but they have to start at six in
he morning, or earlier, and they get
jack at eleven at night, or later. The
jest way, according to all authorities,
to go from Aix, due north of the
Monastery, to Grenoble, due south oi
t, and start from there. But the people
of Grenoble have complicated matters
still more by constructing a tramway
which goes in a straight line from their
city to nowhere in particular among the
mountains, but happens to pass within
about five miles of the Monastery. It
is possible that some rash travellers
tiave been tempted to go by this route
but in that case they are still trying to
get from the tramway to the Chartreuse
for no one has yet heard any particulars
of their journey or of their arrival.
Moreover, from wherever you go, you
must start at six in the morning. Thii
as everyone knows, is not difficult to
manage in a modern foreign hotel, be-
cause at the other side of one of th
portes de communication in your bed

or coughs, or packs up with terrific
bangs at five in the morning, or earlier

It was a blazing afternoon. I stepped
nto a compartment where sat a solitary
"'renchman, a southern Frenchman, a
man of the province next to that of
'ARTARIN. The compartment was like
n oven, but its occupant seemed as
ool as a cucumber. For nearly four
ours that Frenchman, that southern
'renchman, sat silent and motionless,
'he train shook, and jolted, and stopped,
nd wherever it stopped our compart-
ment always came opposite that fiendish
lectric bell which rings throughout

silently folded up his newspaper,
which apparently he had not yet
finished, and stepped from the carriage
without a word. I, the Englishman,
bounded out, and ran to the station
door as fast as I could, just to relieve
my nerves. May I never ride in a train-

CHARACTERS OF THE ELEVEN
(At Mr. Bull's School).
MacLaren (captain). As a captain is
inclined to bold experiments. When
they come off he murmurs, "I told you
so;" when they don't, other people
mutter the same remark. But it's a
wise captain that knows his own mind.
Jaclison. Has served both his country
and his county with distinction. In
consequence of his performances at his
last school a near relative was given an
important post in Ireland, and since
then his feats as Captain in the 3rd
Lancaster Regiment have earned a peer-
age for the same gentleman. The JACK-
SON is father of the man.
Fry. A disappointing bat, but when
set can cover the distance between the
wickets in two long jumps. Was once
a most prolific contributor to the Cen-
tury, but too much writing at express
rates has spoilt his eye. However,
perhaps the pen is mightier.than the bat.
Liltey. A deb'cate plant, never to be
seen in the open field except when
propped up by three sticks, both behind
and in front of which he is deservedly
unpopular with the other side.
Braund. A leg specialist, with an eye
as sharp as a bat's and a bat as straight
as an I.
Hirst. On his day has an ugly swerve
through no fault of his own. When
the ball comes "with his arm," it is
very awkward, as the batsman does not
know which to hit at.
Rhodes. Looks simple, but is dan-
gerous to batsmen, both pitch and
direction being deceptive. Still, it's a
long lane that has no turning, and all
roads lead to the pavilion in time.
Abel. A neat little bat, considering
his age. According to public opinion
(off the select few) can neither play fast
bowling nor hold catches. Stifl, able is
as ably does.
Tyldesley. Another promising little
bat, and can field. Not very big, but
what there is of him goes a long way.
Barnes. Has garnered many a corn-
stalk, though he depends on fine weather
for his harvest. Can generally make hay
(off the other side) when the sun shines.
Jessop. Crouches like a tiger, and
lashes his bat b'ke a tail. Bats on the
theory that no one but himself can field.
If he wouldn't hit at everything might
make an orthodox player. Would never
get out—if he could hit harder. For a
hit into the Bush is worth two in t he hand.

Instructor (to almost inaudible Sub. instructing squad}. "Nor QUITS so MANY OF THESE OOSFIDISTIAL on PERK, SIR!
TO A WINNER AT HENLEY.
SIR,—The thunder o£ the cheering, the congratulatory
voices and handshakes have by now become a memory;
they are gone with the winds that blew in vain down the
course to baffle your efforts ; but even at this late hour you
will not take it ill that Mr. Punch, the friend of all gallant
men and the admirer of all honest, manly endeavour, should
add his words to those by which your victory has been
already acclaimed. When with a last effort you helped to
drive your boat past the winning-post, when you realised
that the flag had fallen, and that your crew had really won
the final heat—then, of course, was your great moment. What
a dim, perplexing dream the race itself had already become
in your mind! You remembered your efforts to straighten
your boat at the starting-post, you recalled the eager,
anxious face of the coxswain, you still seemed to hear the
callous, unmoved voice of the umpire as he issued his final
directions before the start—then came the intense pause,
and at last the word that released you for the desperate
race, but all else was vague and unsubstantial. The actual
race, what can you remember of it? You knew you were
rowing; you caught glimpses of the other crew out of the
corner of your eye; the posts flashed by you in an endless
succession ; here and there a shout rang out to you strangely
distinct above the rest; the back of the man in front of you
was swinging relentlessly, and somehow you felt by the
swing and dash of your crew, by the slowly receding forms
of your opponents, and by the coxswain's delighted words
that you were winning. Then came a gathering, swelling
roar of innumerable voices all shouting together. The tents,
the stands, the pleasure-boats behind the booms flew past
your eyes and—" Easy all!" came from the coxswain, and
the race was over, and your name was added to the roll of
Henley heroes. It was a glorious, an unapproachable
moment.
That first fine careless rapture is past, but the sense of
glorious accomplishment, of toil and discipline and zeal
and abstinence rewarded a thousandfold, of honour secured
not for yourself alone, but for the crew you rowed with and
for the beloved Club whose colours you wore—that remains
with you a possession for ever. You may win again, but
the zest and freshness of this first triumph can never be
rivalled. And in after years when you revisit Henley as a
portly veteran, pleased with the efforts of the youngsters,
but firmly convinced that rowing is not quite what it used
to be, te pvero, you will call up again that great day and
will embroider, as veterans sometimes do, the story of the
race with all the embellishments of a vivid imagination.
Well, it may not be quite accurate that you spurted at the
particular spot you point out, or that your stroke was at the
rate of 48 to the minute, or that no single drop of water
was splashed into the boat during the race—but what of
that? You won. That is the great fact; it stands on the
imperishable records of the Regatta, and sheds a lustre on
you as you go through life. And in some other year, too,
when victory may not have perched upon your banner, you
will learn perhaps to appreciate how those feel who lose a
race. They also have striven and endured, and a share of
honour must be theirs, for, after all, tke game itself, with the
effort and energy that accompany it—that is the thing.
Victory is delightful, defeat is, or seems to be, intolerable,
but the noble pursuit of a noble, healthy exercise is greater
even than victory, and makes amends for defeat. So
here's good

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAKY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 7.
—Some doubt in mind of the interested
observer as to whether in matter of the
Sandhurst rustications HUGH CECIL was
leading WINSTON CHURCHILL, or whether
WINSTON was captaining the Head of the
Church at Westminster. To put it in
another way, was the dog wagging the
HUGH CECIL and WINSTON, burning
with the concentrated energy of twenty
thousand Cornishmen, resolved to know
the reason why. When Questions called
on to-day, WINSTON was discovered in
corner seat below Gangway sacred to the
presence of JEMMY LOWTHER. That right
hon. Recluse, informed that attack on
his friends on Treasury Bench was
pending, cheerily contributed his seat
to the fray. LORD HOOH moved up a

Winston. "I say, HIGH, old man, what a mess you are making of this Sandhurst case!"
Lord H. C. "Well, I like th»t, WINSTON. Hanged if I wasn't just going to say the eame thing to
you! We shall be getting'rusticated'ourselves next!"
tail, or was the tail by exercise of
unwonted vitality and energy operating
upon the dog? If so, which was who?
The attack, howsoever ordered, would
have proved more successful if WINSTON
had kept his old seat behind the
Treasury Bench, or had even, as is his
wont on dress parades, [borrowed the
CAP'EN'S pitch. This was, however, a
great occasion, and he felt he must rise
to it. Opportunity presented itself of
making damaging attack on ST. JOHN
BRODIUCK; that a temptation no good
Unionist, whether above or below the
Gangway, can resist. During the last
eighteen months the War Office has
distinguished itself by high-handed
proceedings. "The first to go," as
WORDSWORTH'S little maid put it, was
HENRY COLVILE. Then REDVERS BDLLER
was smashed. Now twenty-nine cadets
at Sandhurst have been rusticated, their
professional prospects blighted in the
bud because some humourist, either
among the lads or domestic staff, lit a
chest of drawers instead of the fire in
the grate.
seat or two along the second bench in
order to sit immediately behind his
young friend. Amid jeers from Irish
Members, jubilant at prospect of inter-
necine war opposite, BRODRICK read long
answer in attempted justification of
Commander-in-Chief's action.
"BoBS again!" said the MEMBER FOR
SAEK. "BOBS in a new character.
Whenever things went wrong during
his command in South Africa, and
awkward questions were put in the
House, BOBS always dragged on scene
like a movable target, from behind
which the War Office fired its replies."
Lord HUGH and WINSTON bubbled
with excitement like a couple of SWIFT
MAoNEiLLS; jumped up, sometimes both
together, occasionally one before the
other, breathlessly piling up questions;
in turn both called to order by SPEAKER.
WINSTON, so excited, committed fresh
outrage on order, remaining standing
whilst SPEAKER on his legs.
Effect of scene on generous soul of
SWIFT MACNEILL extraordinary. Threw
himself about in paroxysm of excitement;
roared inconsequent interruption. Once
he bellowed "Irish Resident Magis-
trates!" They had no more to do with
the matter than had VELASQUEZ; dragged
in all the same. This too much for
SPEAKER, whose patience with this well-
meaning but volcanic gentleman is
marvellous. Sternly warned him he
"must really " keep order.
WINSTON played his trump card.
Amid shout of delight from Irish Mem-
bers, asked leave to move adjournment
in order to discuss Sandhurst rustica-
tions as matter of urgent public import-
ance. Irish Members already almost on
their feet in support of claim, when
SPEAKER pointed out that, there being
on the Paper a Resolution referring
to same subject, WINSTON'S motion
was blocked. Sudden calm followed
tumultuous storm. House went into
Committee on Education Bill.

shadow of triumphal arch Canada has
erected in Parliament Street as outward
and visible sign of the drawing together
of the Colonies towards the old Mother-
land, an achievement to which DON Josfe
has mainly contributed. In a historic
passage in speech delivered when his
Ministry fell in the very hour of triumph,
PEEL said:" It may be I shall leave a name
sometimes remembered by men whose lot
it is to labour and earn their daily bread
by the sweat of their brow, when they
shall recruit their exhausted strength
with abundant and untaxed food, the
sweeter because it is no longer leavened
with a sense of injustice." DON JOSE'S
name will ever glow in history as that
of the statesman who perceived the
latent prowess of a nation separated
from itself by seas and continents, and
welded it into one mighty force.
In the House DON JOSE, among other
evidence of personal supremacy, is the
mark of fierce personal hatred. The
Irish Members snarl at sight of him
standing cool and collected at the
Table. The Radicals seize every oppor-
tunity to snap at their Lost Leader:
We that had loved him so, followed him,
honoured him,
Lived in his mild and magnificent eye,
Learned his great language, caught hia clear
accents,
Made him our pattern to live and to die.
DON JOSE cannot, indeed does not,
repine at this. A man who plays bowls
(including TOMMY) must expect rubbers.
A hard hitter himself, he doesn't
whimper when his strokes are returned.

qualifications of Head Mastership are,
first to be in Holy Orders, second to be
slightly bald. His authority, he added,
is one of the few Head Masters who are
laymen.
This suggests prejudice in respect to
reference to Holy Orders. But the second
qualification remains, so to speak, in
bald prominence. The case is full of
interest; suggests extensive amplifi-
cation. The MEMBER FOR SABK thinks
it would be a pleasant occupation for
the boys at our public schools to devote
a portion of their leisure time to its
elucidation. The Spectator would doubt-
less cheerfully open its correspondence

Master of the Roman Empire, JULIUS

written in the old chronicles, "he had

be confined to personal observation:
e.g., Is the esteemed Head Master (at

MY earliest recollections are of a fair-

Elizabethan face and Renaissance pro-
file, reciting SHAKSPEARE'S sonnets on the
hearthrug. My parents idolised—pos-
sibly spoiled me, and tiie sturdy Manx
fishermen would walk hundreds oi
miles and wait breakfastless for hours
on the off chance of an interview with
the Wunderkind, the Enfant Prodigue
who had already cast an aureole of fame
round their beloved island. Excursion

ganised 'from Dublin, Manchester

At school I was renowned for a lovely
voice and a fiery temper. My favourite
chum was a young Irish chieftain, in
collaboration with whom I wrote a
comedy called The Divil's Delight. His
name was Pete of the Reeks—the Mac-
Gillycuddy's Reeks. I soon fought my
way to the front in tipcat (a favourite
tfanx game), mandolin-playing, elocu-
ion, the Atomic Theory, and Christian
Science. In my leisure hours I cried over
JEAN-JAOQUES, corresponded with the POPE ,
and wrote to encourage DICKENS, then,
[ fear, somewhat on the down-grade.
Dear old DICKENS! Even in my boyish
days I had already conceived the notion

My record was unique. As a freshman
I won the three-legged hurdle race in
the 'Varsity sports; I was beaten by a
short neck in the Grand National in
my second term—you will remember,
of course, the classic chapter in Tlie
Master Pagan; I was unanimously
elected Bulldog in my second year,
and tied for the wooden spoon at the
Amateur Golf Championship before I
was twenty-one.
After these unparalleled efforts the
Dons thought that it might be well for
me to rusticate for a while. Yielding to
their kindly persuasion I consented, and
while undergoing a rest-cure at Putney
discovered D. G. ROSSETTI, A. C. SWIN-
BURNE, THEODORE WATTS-DUNTON, EDMUND
GOSSE, HOLMAN HUNT (whose Scapegoat
was dedicated to me) and WILLIAM
HEINEMANN. For these services I was
given the gold medal of the Royal
Geographical Society. The rest of my
career is public property. To tell it
here would be to repeat a twice-told
tale. But I may mention that I have
been so pleased by the reception of my
recent historical work on Rome, that I
am seriously thinking of learning Italian.
My next novel, however, is to have a
Latin sub-title: '' Spiritual Power; or,
Christianus ad Leonem XIII."

HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS.
VI.—A STRANGER TO TEA.
I WAS opening the door with my latch-
key when he first addressed me. I
heard the sound of a hiccough behind
me, and, turning round, encountered
the gaze of the most genial pair of eyes
I think that I have ever seen. For the
rest he was unshaven, unwashed, and
was wearing a frowsy serge suit that
gave the impression that its owner had
been caught in the open some time
before in a sudden shower of gravy.
"I should be glad," he observed
jocosely, "of a cup o' tea."
I stared at him.
"I 've just got a job at BROWN'S
Stores," he informed me; "so I should
be glad even of a cup o' tea."
Without altogether seeing the con-
nection in this, I invited him into the
hall, and returned in a moment from
the dining-room with a cup of tea and a
slice of cake. He accepted them with
a kind of amused gratitude, carefully
hanging a battered bowler hat on a peg
next to my own.
"Sir," he remarked with a confiden-
tial grin, as he sipped his tea, "I'm
not an ordnery feller, yer know."
I assured him that I had gathered as
much.
"Just becos yer get yerself up
respectable," he continued, "an' take
some pride in yerself yer know, people
don't believe that you 're in want."
I admitted the unfairness of such an
attitude. He took a long drink at the
tea, and hiccoughed at me.
"I'm down on my luck, Sir," he
remarked jovially, "reg'lar down."
I felt myself bound to smile encourag-
ingly.
"But I 've just got a job at BROWN'S
Stores," he continued, "so I thought
I 'd ask you for a cup o' tea."
He munched away at the cake.
"Been in the army," he remarked,
benignly.
I was sorry for this. It was the first
departure from originality.
"Eight years," he continued; "Roy'l
Artillery—driver. Got my discharge—
varicose veins."
The thought of the latter seemed to
afford him the keenest amusement. He
finished his tea, and put the cup down
on a chair.
"Not 'avin been introduced to you,"
he observed, "I 'm afraid I don't know
'oo you are — GARVEY, my name is,
ROBERT GARVEY"—he beamed at me.
"They call me BOB for short."
I nodded, and glanced towards his hat.
"Reg'lar down on my luck I am,
Sir," he observed, with increasing
joviality. "Lost my missus."
He paused, then took up his hat.
"I m very much obliged to yer, Sir,"
he said, "for the tea."
"Your conversation," I answered,
"has been more than worth it," and
I opened the door.
"I start at BROWN'S Stores termorrer,"
he remarked. "Van-driver."
I nodded.
"I shall finish work tennorrer night
at nine," he resumed. "D'yer think
you 'd be in then, Sir?"
"I fear not," I answered, and opened
the door wider. He did not move, but
motioned to me mysteriously.
"Ishould like," said he, with a sudden
gravity, "to speak to you personly."
I assured him of my material presence.
"I 'm down on my luck, Sir—reg'lar
'ard up. If you could oblige me with
a small loan—I could bring it back
termorrer—it 'd "elp me a bit. I 'm
askin' you, Sir, ter save me troublin'
anybody else."
This struck me as a somewhat broad
view of my philanthropy. However, I
did not disappoint his opinion of me.
Besides, it was not altogether a gratuity.
In an instant he was his genial self
once more. He wrung my hand.
"You 've 'elped someone that deserves
it," he said.
"The service," I answered, "has
been reciprocal."
"You re right, Sir," he returned
intelligently, and stepped out on to the
doorstep. "Good-night, Sir. You 've
'elped someone that"
"Well, you haven't far to go," I
interrupted, stepping out after him.
He stopped, and looked at me ques-
tioningly.
"The ' King's Arms,'" I explained,
"is only just round the corner.
He smiled at me sadly.
"It will soon take away the taste of
the tea," I continued, encouragingly.
"Sir "he began with a reproach-
ful hiccough.
"Come, get along!" I said.
He met my eye and grinned broadly.
"You're a gentleman, Sir," he in-
formed me, and touched his hat.
"Good-night."
And he limped off down the street,
leaving me standing on the doorstep,
regretfully mindful that an additional
twopence might have elevated me to the
military.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TRIP TO SCOTLAND YARD.
IT all arose out of a remark of
GWENDOLEN'S. "Don't you think cabmen
have the most charming manners, JACK ?''
she asked. "Miss SKINFLINT says she
is always having disputes with them
about fares ; but when I pay them,
they always take off their hats and say,
'Thank you, Madam.'"
Though I do not take an unduly
pessimistic view of cabmen's nature,
this statement roused my suspicions ; and
asking for further particulars, I elicited
the fact that GWEN had taken a hansom
that morning from Charing Cross to
Piccadilly Circus, and given the man
half-a-crown. "He seemed quite satis-
fied," she added.
I went across to my desk and began
to write a letter.
"Whatever are you doing?" asked
GWEN, puzzled by my behaviour.
"Writing to Scotland Yard, my dear.
I understand they publish tables of cab-
fares which may save us about half our
income."
GWEN was much interested to hear
this, and eagerly awaited the reply to
ray letter. When three or four days
had passed and it had not yet arrived,
and GWEN was coiftinuing her payments
at her old rate, I decided to call at
Scotland Yard myself and procure a
table.
On arriving at the door I explained
my errand to a constable, who escorted
me into an office, where I re-explained
it to another policeman. The second
officer made some notes in a book,
looked grave, and rang for a third
officer, whom he directed to conduct me
to Mr. CARTEB in the next department.
No. 3 then conveyed me along a passage
to a lift, where he handed me over to a
porter.
"Aren't you going to see the thing
through?" Tasked.
"Not allowed to move off my own
beat, Sir. Thank you, Sir."
The lift soon brought me up to the
top of the building, and a fourth officer
appeared who led the way to Mr.
CARTER'S. For the third time I explained
that I wanted to buy a shilling table of
cab-fares, and at last it looked as if I
was beginning to get on the right track.
Mr. CARTER admitted that there were
such things—nay more, he promised to
give me an order for one, which must be
taken to Mr. PHILIPS in the basement,
who would initial it. But just as he
was about to sign the order, I had
the misfortune to mention that I had
written to the office and received no
reply.
"Oh, you've written, have you?"
said Mr." CARTER. "Well, you had
better find out what has become of
your letter."

MR. PUNCH'S PATENT COOLER DURING A HEAT WAVE.
I protested my indifference as to its
fate; I only wanted my shilling table.
"But suppose the letter has been
answered by this time? Then you
would be getting two tables."
"Well, I '11 bear the loss and pay for
both," said I.
But I could not prevail on Mr. CARTER
to accept this simple solution of the
problem. He rang for a fourth con-
stable, and instructed him to take me
to the Controller's Department in search
of my letter. Down the lift again I
went, and through many passages to a
different part of the buildings, where the
Sub-Assistant-Auditor-General received
me in his office. Personally he had no
knowledge of my letter, but he begged
me to take a seat whilst he inquired
into the matter. For half-an-hour I
listened to the ring of the telephone-bell,
and then at last a clerk came from a
distant office with my letter. It was
covered with the initials of various
officials, and the Sub-Assistant-Auditor-
General explained that the reply had
been delayed because it had been
initialled by the Acting-Sub-Inspector-
General of the Audit and Account Office
instead of by the Chief - Managing -
Assistant-Director of the Income and
Expenditure Department. The mistake
had now been rectified, and if I took
the letter down to Mr. CARTER, all would
be plain sailing.
With the aid of a fifth constable I
retraced my steps to Mr. CARTER'S office.
He seemed much surprised at my speedy
return. "Well," he asked, "wasn't it
much better to go and get the letter?"
"My time," I ventured to suggest,
"is generally worth more than a shilling
a day."
This remark was not worth answer-
ing.
"You will take this down to Mr.
PHILIPS," said Mr. CARTER, when he
had written me out an order, "and
when he has initialled it, please bring
it back to me."
As I was leaving the room, a gentle-
man entered it. "Ah," said Mr. CARTER,
"this is Mr. PHILIPS."
Now, thought I, I shall be saved a
trip to the basement and back. Not at
all. Mr. PHILIPS had no authority in
Mr. CARTER'S department; but he pro-
mised, if I would go down to the base-
ment, to follow me as soon as he had
consulted Mr. CARTER on a matter of
pressing importance.
A sixth constable now took me in
cliarge. Being new to Scotland Yard,
he had still a remnant of human nature
left in him. "If you wants to get that
table to-night, Sir, I should advise you
to give that there letter to the porter in
charge as soon as you gets to the base-
ment, and then perhaps it will be ready
for Mr. PHILIPS to sign before he goes
home for dinner."
I took his advice, and as soon as I
reached Mr. PHILIPS' office, handed the
letter to a porter, who presented it to
an office boy who passed it on to a
junior clerk, who gave it to a senior
clerk, who showed it to the Sub-Assist-
ant-Manager, who informed me it would
have to be initialled by Mr. PHILIPS.
I thanked him for this piece of informa-
tion, and he said he would get it put
through for me. Pressure being thus
brought to bear on the staff, the letter
was ready by the time Mr. PHILIPS
returned, and hardly a moment was
lost in securing his initial. Seldom had

BACILLI OF SUMMER SALE FEVER.
A COMPLAINT VERY PREVALENT JUST NOW AMONG THE WEAKER SEX.
Scotland Yard done so smart a piece of
work.
I returned in triumph to Mr. CARTER,
who said he would now send up to get
me the table. Half-an-hour passed, and
then a telephone bell rang. A long
conversation ensued between Mr. CARTER
and an unknown voice, at the end of
which Mr. CARTER turned to me to
explain the situation. It seemed that
my house was mid-way between the
hackney-coach stand in Kensington
High Street and that in Edwardes
Square. I said I did not care which
table I had. Unfortunately, however,
I had stated in my letter that I wanted
the table measured from the spot nearest
to my house, and that table or nothing
I must have. Two experts were at
work measuring the distances on a
map, but they could not agree which
was the nearer; perhaps if I would step
up I might help them to decide.
As Mr. CARTER was speaking, Big Ben
struck, a constable appeared at the
door, and a general stir was perceptible
through Scotland Yavd. "Closing
time," announced Mr. CARTER. "Per-
haps if yoir will call to-morrow"
"Impossible," said I.
"Well, if you will leave me a shilling,
the table shall be sent you as soon as
the experts decide which, it is that you
want.
A week later a constable arrived at
my house with a long package marked
"URGENT." As the table is some 6 feet
long by 4 feet wide, OWEN finds it
very convenient to carry about with
her, and of course always has it in her
pocket when there is any likelihood of
wanting a cab.
TO PHYLLIS.
PHTLLTS, as you lie
Where the green leaves quiver,
And the stream flows by
Of the cool, sweet river!
While of you I think—
Wondering and dreaming—
With cool cups to drink,
Strawberries-and-creaming;
Spare a thought for me,
PHYLLIS, of your pity,
Doomed all day to be
Sweltering in the city.
NOTHING NEW.

hi* opinion that fifty yean hence the novel will be

'Tis said when you and I are old
There will not be the smallest chance
To seek in fancy's realms of gold
The charming sprite of old romance;
The world will cease to care a jot
For any heroine's dilemma,
And Waverley will be forgot,
And equally neglected Emma!
Nor WeUer's quips nor Carton's grit
Will save our DICKENS from decay;
And all that play of mordant wit
Will not avail poor THACKERAY;
No more shall I, when fancy yields
To the charmed spell of my Havana,
Wander with Tess through Wessex
fields,
Or, at the Crossways, meet Diana!
We move so rapidly, they say,
And life 's so full of storm and stress,
We needs must get, when we are grey,
Our fiction from the daily press ;—
And yet it's difficult, I vow,
To see at what the prophet's driving;
For fiction fills the papers now,
And still the firm of MUDIE 'a thriving!
FLOREAT ETONA!
THE Etonian dinner given by Old
Etonians (but Etonians, like the visitors
to Bath in Mr. Pickwick's time, are
"never old ") to the Lord Mayor, Sir
J. C. DIMSDALE, in the Grocers' Hall, on
Friday last, was an unqualified success.
Mr. ARTHUR BALFODR was at his best, and
Lord ROSEBERY in his very happiest vein
of humour. The KINO'S health—his best
health—was enthusiastically drunk, and
the toast of "Eton," naturally associated
with drinking, was cheered to the echo
by all who, "with heart and voice,"
there and then joined in the Etonian
boating chorus of "Swing, swing to-
gether." This was given in such perfect
unison as could only be attained by men
who, whatever allowances might have
to be made for differences in age, weight,
and opinions, felt that for the time being,
and for the tune, they were " all in the
same boat." The entire evening was
thoroughly Eton, and so was the excel-
lent dinner. Such a gathering is unique,
even in the banqueting annals of the
much feasting City. The chorus afore-
said went with a lilt, and, as oars through
the water, with a swish .... but,
Dr. WARRE being present, this word
was not used out of deference to the
Head Master's wish.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
WHEN the Comte DE MERCY-AHQENTEAO sat down daily to
•write his secret letters to MARIE-THER£SE, Empress of Austria,
he little thought he was penning pages that nearly a century
and a half later would be eagerly read by the student of
history. He was Austrian Ambassador at the Court of
Versailles between the years 1766—1790. That was the
outward and visible sign of him. Apart from his official
position he was the spy of the Austrian Empress at a friendly
Court, the secretly appointed guardian of her hapless
daughter, MARIE ANTOINETTE. Every day through ten years
the Comte wrote to the EMPRESS, giving her minute accounts
of her unsuspecting daughter's doings and of the Court in
which the young girl passed her life. It was part of the
Comte's success that, living under a re'gime where espionage
was cultivated as a fine art and practised as an hourly
avocation, he succeeded in getting his correspondence safely
delivered into the hands of the EMPRESS. Thus protected,
he felt at liberty to write with the freedom of conversation
with a trusted friend. The letters, preserved in the Imperial
archives of Austria, were some years ago unearthed and
published in three mighty volumes. Miss LILLIAN SMTTHE
has translated the most interesting of them, stringing them
together in a brightly-told historical narrative. They are
published by Messrs. HUTCHINSON in two handsome volumes,
illustrated by many portraits and photogravures of pictures
to-day hung on the walls of the chateau that once was the
home of the Austrian EMPRESS'S correspondent. It would be
impossible to exaggerate the interest of the work. Here,
drawn from life, snapshots taken whilst they, unsuspecting,
talked and laughed, ate and drank, gambled and conspired,
sinned and went to church, are pictures of the men and
women who made the Court of Louis THE FIFTEENTH. My
Baronite has marked many passages for quotation and
comment. But the book is long and this page is brief. If
any would learn how vile was the Bourbon Court that led
straight up to the Revolution, what poor creatures were the
men, what soiled butterflies the women, how mean a thing
a king may be, and how downtrodden a people, he should
straightway study The Guardian of Marie Antoinette.
Mr. FREDERICK GOODALL, R.A., has, in his Reminiscences,
recently issued by the Walter Scott Publishing Co., Ltd.,
given us a pleasantly-written volume, full of varied and
attractive material. Mr. GOODALL'S stories of TURNER, ROSA
BONHEUR, RUSKIN, STANFIELD, MACLI8E, DAVID CoX, LEIGHTON,
and other well-known representatives of whatever is best in
Art, Literature and the Drama, are generally amusing and
always more or less interesting. Mr. GOODALL tells how, on
one occasion, he was introduced to Colonel NORTH, the
millionaire, and how the Colonel bought a picture of his
and insisted on binding the bargain with a tumbler of cham-
pagne. "He gave instructions to the waiter," recounts the

modest artist, "to make no half-measures—a thing I had
never done in my life before or since. After that,"he adds,
"I hurried away to tell my wife the pleasant news." This
conveys a rather confused and tumbler-of-champagny view
of the jovial incident. Even at this distance of time there
is a jovial muddle in the narration, just as if the Colonel's
"fizz " had not quite got out of the temperate artist's head.
It is characteristic of Mr. GOODALL'S generous appreciation of
the smallest scintillation of wit that he should record how
ROSA BONHEUR "said she, was 'Bonheur,' but that I was
'Bon tout,'" which jeu de mot Mr. GOODALL, in a sort of
jocular Pepysian vein, considers "a pretty play on my
name." This "appreciation" entitles the genial artist
to take rank among the easily amused friends of Mr. Peter
Magnus, who, his initials being P. M., used to sign himself
"Afternoon," to their great delight. Altogether it is the
good-naturedly chatty work of a kindly man, who needs no
apology for being less skilful with the pen than with the
brush. "Ad multos annos, Mr. GOODALL, R.A.," says

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BOOK OF KING ARTHUR.
A Fragment of Malory.
"Ho* King A HTnrit was crowned, and how be made officen."
THEN ARTHUR that was sister's son to Sir ROBERT OF
CECILY (he that had great lore of alchemy and well knew
the use of vials and retorts, courteous or other) did do call
a great assay of knights. And it was about the feast of
St. Swithin. And challenge was made that whoso should
assay and had most force to wield the club Ex-Bulger he
should have mastery of the knighthood.
But of all the lords and commons was none but ARTHUR
that might avail to wield it; save only Sir ORCH the cham-
berlain, and he was sick of a passing sore alibi. Wherefore
he let send his son Sir AUSTEN the treasurer, saying: '' Sir
aud my rightwise liege, I would not, and if I could, assay
against you. Count me, I pray you, of your vassalage; me
contenteth to abide constable of the Outland Britons. Be
right sure of my allegiance so long as I be on live."
And when Sir AUSTEN had been well delivered of this
word, then the most part of the knighthood sware fealty,
and with so loud a voice that the young bloods, that would
have had Sir ORCH for king, stood abashed and refrained
themselves. And duke CHATTESYTORTH, waking from a great
swound, likewise sware fealty by the faith of his body, and
fell again heavily on sleep. And the haut lord LSEDDON of
the Isles, that was not bidden to this assay, gave audience
to a chronicler, and bad make public asseverance of his
good-will. And so by choice of the knighthood, and by
assent of the haut lord SEDDON of the Isles, was ARTHUR
crowned king.
And thereafter, at the lists of the West Minster, Sir BELCHASIP
PORTE-DRAPEAU, that had right often justed with ARTHUR'S
company, spake exceeding pleasaunt words, very spontaneous,
so as ARTHUR grew red of cheek like to a shame-faced damsel.
And the knights had great content each of other.
And I shall tell you how that ARTHUR must needs have
new officers of his Table. For Sir MIKE LE DESPENSER that
was over the tolls, and had made them more grievous than
ever had been heretofore, pleaded eld, and would withdraw
him into hermitage. And thereto, as the word is, he made
as if to send in his checks. Yet was he still well beseen
and debonair, and a mark for ladies to look on at the trellis.
And the choice of some, not being asked, fell on the lord
GEORGE, of Hamiltoun and Inde, for that he would come to the
matter with a free wit untainted by knowledge of any such
manner of thing. But some there were that held that Sir
BROADRICK DE SANDHURST stood in parlous need of new
employ, and would deal no worse in this wise than elsewhere.
And other some would have Sir HANBCRGH summoned like
duke CINCINNATUS from the plough. And there were certain
few that would let recall the overlord of OUTRF.VALLES from
nether Afric, for no cause save that he knew, better than
most, what he would be after; and make place for another
that should be a babe in such business.
But so many and great were shown to be the deserts of
other knights that there was rumour how a new leaf should
be added to the Round Table. And of councillors that
made choice aforehand in the king's behalf was no sort of
lack; and, namely, of chroniclers that have presage of all
things or ever they come to pass.
But against every each need did ARTHUR devise as seemed
him good.

Till they couldn't refuse,
And packed them into the entry list.
Leander came
Wid their roll of fame,
But Henley had made 'em look crazy now.
Wid their caps of pink
They could make you blink,
And their cox sayin', "Arrah, be aisy now."
They were cheerful and gay
In their English way,
And they never looked to be troublin', boys,
Till they caught a sight
Of the black and white
Of the Trinity College Dublin boys.
The Ruderverein
Looked mighty fine,
And, oh, but it's confident still I am
That they '11 make us blow
When they start to row,
These lads of the Emperor WILLIAM.
They smoked no pips,
But they drank their swipes,
And they ate their mutton and chicken up;
And Donner und Blitz,
But they gave us fits,
Wid their German moustaches stickin' up.
Emmanuel too
Looked neat and new:
From the banks of the Cam, where the willows are,
They had travelled to see
The river Lee,
Where the currents and tides and the billows are.
There were Oxford Blues
In their College crews,
And they didn't mean to be dawdlin' there
In the head of the Is-
-is dressed up nice,
And the Scarlet College of Magdalen there.
From the South and the North
Of the isle came forth
The Irishmen full of devilry:
They were broths of boys
For the fun and noise,
And good at rowing and revelry.
And when they had done
There was one crew won,
And eight of the rowers were frisky there;
But none of the rest
Looked much depressed,
For they knew there was plenty of whisky there.

AN EDUCATIONAL PRODUCT:
NEW STYLE.
MY DEAR GUT,—Isn't it ripping? I 've
got my colours for the Eleven after all,
just when I thought I was going to get
kicked out, as I hadn't made many
runs lately, only 7 and 11 and 0 and 17
in the last two matches. But last night
GRACE (our Captain, you know) came
into my room after House-prayers and
said, "I've very much pleasure in
giving you your colours." I never felt
so like crying in my life. Won't Father
be pleased! It'« all his teaching me
to catch got me them, because GRACE
said it was specially for my fielding.
And I 've been made a Prefect, too,
though I 'm not in the Sixth yet, which
is very lucky for me. At the end of
this term the Eleven goes to St. Nicho-
las to play our great match. It takes us
a whole day in the train to get there, and
we shall sleep there two nights. Won't
it be splendid? Do thev let your Eleven
go as far as that to play matches? I
do hope we win. I know I shall be
jolly nervous. Fancy reading, when
the account of the match comes out in
the school magazine, that I had made a
duck, or missed a catch, or let a ball
through my legs! After the match
I 've asked our captain to come home
with me for the holidays. There's no
one in the world I like so much, though
I didn't use to, except, of course,
Mummie and Father and you. I do
hope you two will hit it off. I do like
people to be strong, and there's no one
in the school can throw half so far, and
as for batting I really believe our GRACE
is nearly as good as W. G., besides
being Al at hockey and swimming and
everything else. Oh, dear! I do wish
you were better at cricket. We three
might have had such fun together if
you were. Of course it's very jolly
your being so clever. I told GRACE you
were top of the school, and I 'm very
proud of you, dear old boy, but I had
to say you weren't in the Eleven. Still,
I never can help wishing that you didn't
take after Mummie so much—not in
that respect, I mean. Of course, I
know it isn't her fault. They used to
do calisthenics when she was at school,
and wear back-boards, and sew, and go
for walks two and two, so it's no
wonder she doesn't know one end of
a hat from the other! And even then
she was luckier than most girls, because
generally they didn't go to school at all,
but just sat in the drawing-room with
their mothers all day. I must go now,
I've got some beastly rep. to learn.
I '11 try and finish this to-morrow,

cornea to teach us drawing. We call
him that because he drops his H's, and
his name is HORACE, and one leg is
shorter than the other, or else one's
too long. And the Head saw it stuck
on the black-board, and says if whoever
did it doesn't confess the whole form
will have to go home, and I and our
best bowler won't be able to play in the
match! Isn't it horribly unfair—like
they did at Sandhurst. I 'm perfectly
miserable about it. I 've been looking
forward to the chance of playing the
whole of this term. I believe I know
who did it too, only of course I don't
want to tell. At least I'm not sure
yet. Do you think—considering how
awfully important it is that we should
win this match—I might? Goodness!
There 's 3 striking, and my net practice
is at 3.10. I must fly. I '11 let you

Your loving Sister, MAT.
P.S.—It 's all right! She 's con-
fessed! I 'm awfully glad I didn't
sneak now. It was the girl I thought
it was all the time. I told GRACE, and
she asked her point-blank if it was her,
and it was, and she 's awfully keen on
games, though she 's too small yet to
be much good, and directly GRACE put
it to her about the match, and how
important it was for the school, she
saw it at once. I don't think she '11
get into much of a row, only have to
apologise to old ORATIO most likely, I
expect.
P.S. 2.—Bother! I 've lost one of
my batting-gloves. And you might
tell someone to have the nets up and a
decent wicket ready for GRACE and me
when we come. MAT.

THE COMPLETE SPELLER.
["It is no longer necessary that a gentleman
should know how to handle a rapier, but spell he
must."—Monthly Paper.]
THE courtly grace of bygone days
Is, my CLARISSA, now no more;
The stately bow, the well-turned phrase
That pleased our ancestors of yore
No longer added honours bring
To rank that's high or blood that's
blue,
And he who'd reign a social king
Must know his Nuttall through and
through.
I am not famous for the grace
With which I twirl my clouded cane,
I seldom trim my shirt with lace,
Holding such fripperies as vain.
If that your praises I would tell
From high-flown compliments I flee,
And shun the thing that I can spell,
Apothegmatic eulogy.
I am not naturally fierce,
Though far from craven is my heart;
I little know of thrusts in tierce,
Nor can I disengage in carte;
For fencing care I not a jot,
Nor thirst to slay my mortal foe,
Yet I can spell what I am not,
That is a braggadocio.
Yes, though in lists I may not ride
To champion her I fain would wed,
In lists examiners provide
My name is always at the head.
And, as I know my Webster pat,
As fits a man of pedigree,
Dear, let me wear your favours at
The next All-England Spelling Bee.
LA GRANDE CHARTREUSE.
WHEN you have reached Grenoble
from Aix-les-Bains you discover that
you are about as far from the Monastery
on the other side. But that only makes
you more eager to get there. People
who have never been to Aix can have
no idea how the excursion to the
Grande Chartreuse grows upon you.
The difficulties of the journey increase
your expectations of the beauties at the
end. The exploits of those who have
got there, and back again, fill you with
envy. It occurs to you that, ever after,
if you are offered a glass of chartreuse
jaune or chartreuse verte, you will
think, or say, "I have tasted it at the
Monastery itself." The Monastery! The
very name suggests something ancient
and beautiful. Why the one at Haute-
combe, just across the Lac du Bourget,
in a building of no historical interest,
and for the most part of contemptible
carpenter's Gothic, which only Baedeker
could admire, is a delightful place,
amidst charming gardens sloping up
from the blue waters of the lake. At
last you feel that you must see the
Grande Chartreuse and die, even if
your death is caused by undue hurry-
ing at six in the morning.
Nevertheless, at Grenoble, I still
cherish faint hopes that it may be
possible to leave at a reasonable time.
Before I finish dinner I ask the head
waiter if it is necessary to start early.
"Ah non, Monsieur," he replies, with
the air of a man who had never heard
such a thing suggested, "pas du tout.
Vous partez a six heures."
But further investigation in time-
tables reveals the unsuspected fact that
there is a late train, a sort of train de
luxe for invalids or sybaritic million-
aires, which starts at 8.5 A.M. Sup-
posing that anyone in ordinary health
and of decent poverty is allowed to
travel by this, it really would be
pleasant to linger in bed till half-past
six just for once. The station is far
uway, and the hotel omnibus starts
before half-past seven. I remark to the
concierge that at that hour one could
not of course obtain a cab. "Mais si,
Monsieur," he answers, almost indig-
nant at the implication that his fellow-
citizens are sluggards, "les voitures de
place sont lit, a partir de sept heures."
The next morning, waking earlier
than necessary, I almost startle these
early risers by demanding a cold bath
at half-past five. The garcon de Vetage
struggles in, hauling a bain de siege,
places it on the floor, and contemplates
it with an expression of thoughtful
anxiety. Suddenly a bright smile
comes over his face, and he exclaims,
with his Southern accent, "Maing-
tenaing il faut de I'eau." So, having
bad a cold bath with water in addition,
I have time to drive round Grenoble,
and see its pleasant gardens and fine
streets, before I catch the train at
eight.
This train does not take you to the
Srande Chartreuse. It does not even
take you to the place whence you start
to go there. It takes you in an entirely
different direction, towards Lyons, and
it drops you at 8.55 at one little town,
where you find a little tramway train
starting at 10—so, if you wish, you can
snatch an hour's sleep in the saZZe
d'attente before it goes—which takes
you in another hour to another little
town, whence finally un breach conveys
you, all eagerness at approaching your
destination after these changes, to the
rande Chartreuse. The little tramway
passes through fine hilly scenery, the
breach mounts slowly through delight-
ful woods and precipitous gorges, and
at last, after this tremendous journey,
the Grande Chartreuse, the goal of all
your efforts, bursts upon your astonished
gaze.
Astonished, with good reason. It
may be a goal, but it looks much more
like a gaol. Its plainness cannot be
due to any rules of the Order, for—not
to mention the one at Pavia—there is a
Certosa near Florence which is delight-
ful and beautiful, and as easy to reach
as it is difficult to tear oneself away
from. The Grande Chartreuse is an
absolutely uninteresting building, in a
valley, high among mountains, with
no view in any direction. There is
nothing whatever to see, inside or out.
As for the liqueur, some small bottles
for sale are the only things that remind
one of its existence. When, after
infinite difficulty, one has arrived, one's
only idea is to get away again as fast
as possible.
So ,if ever, on a summer afternoon,
you should think of this excursion
while sitting in the shade at Aix, I
advise you to snap your fingers at
Baedeker, and go to sleep comfortably
where you are. ROBINSON THE ROVER.
WAKE UP, ENGLAND.

good business. Show him the olc
motto behind the door:—"In Provi-
dence we trust. All others cash."
I 've been having a look round London
as well aa I could, allowing for th<
weather, which, in a manner of speak
ing, has been spotty. Just now I 've
got as far as the Strand and the police-
men. The Strand, you know, ELIZA, is
one of the principal thoroughfares in
this City, like Ninth Street in Clamville
and when it's tidied up I dare swear
it '11 be all right. At present it's a bit
jagged, and the language of the car
drivers has scorched a deal of the paint
off the lamp standards. I will allow
ELIZA, that for real glowing words the
London car driver gets a fine hold oi
possibilities when he 's thick in a
tor twenty minutes. Remember how
RED RUBE held forth when he shot hi;
finger off at the barbecue, and the
remarks of TIM McGiNTY when his
daughter skipped with a vaudeville
crowd? That was just a mission service
compared to a car driver's oratory when
he finds he '11 be ten minutes late on
the scheduled time.
I was yarning to a Britisher the other
evening on the stoop of the hotel. He
was an intelligent sort of a dude, and
stepped out of his national ice-safe
manner for quite five minutes wh^n
he 'd persuaded himself that I wasn't
selling him a gold brick or buried
dollars in Spain.
"Now this Strand of yours," I said;
"I '11 allow it's a mighty pretty
street, but do tell why you 're making
claims on it? Anyone lost anything,
or is it for the sake and health of the
unemployed?"
"Well, you see," said the Britisher,
slowly, "it appears there 's going to be
a Coronation. When the authorities
heard of that fact through the low
common newspapers they started the
celebrations early, and just dug up the
Strand to give us something to look at."
(I believe a Britisher has been known
to joke, so I took it that way.)
Fancy that in Clamville, 'LiZA!
There 'd be | some smart play with the
gams, I reckon.
But the policeman, 'LiZA! Oh! he 's
a bute! 1 saw one the other day at
work. He was just great. A car had
mixed itself up with a fruit lorry, the
off wheel of a pair-horse shay was
sharing the trouble, two old girls were
in the middle of it all wanting to faint
and afraid to do it, while a crowd of
three hundred looked on and gave silly
advice. Then the policeman, 'LiZA,
came before the curtain. He pushed
off the crowd, unfixed the car and lorry,
took the name and address of the pair-
horse shay and helped the old girls
across the road into a tea dive in two
minutes without so much as sweating.

THE BALLAD OF THE CAUTIOUS
LOVER.
FAIR she is and kind and gracious,
As my heart would fain confess,
But it might seem too audacious,
And she might respect me less;
For our friendship is so recent,
Time alone its strength can prove;
And it would be scarcely decent
At this point to hint of love.
Were she just a trifle older,
And a shade less prone to jest,
Then I might perchance prove bolder,
Yet a cautious game is best;
It will save me future worry,
Spare the cynic's mocking smile,
If I wait and do not hurry,
Weighing pro's and con's the while.

And a deal of mental strife,

Though her beauty 's not distracting,
And she has her faults, 'tis true,
Yet one must not be exacting,
On the whole I think she '11 do.

"Thank you for your condescension,
You are really very kind,
But this masculine attention
Must distress your peace of mind;

Up for many an anxious week,
That you 've watched and criticised me,

NOTES ON K. OF K.'S RETURN.
LORD KITCHENER'S aversion from re-
ceiving addresses is well known, but
the report that the General made use
of an expletive after listening to the
Paddington Corporation is untrue, and
the misconception arose in a peculiar
way. The Mayor of Paddington who
presented the address was Sir JOHN
AIRD, and the General happened to ask
him how his Dam was getting on.
The arrival platform was laid with
Brussels carpet. The fact that Lord
KITCHENER trod this underfoot has been
taken as a personal insult by Dr. LEYDB.
History repeats itself. In the Franco-
Prussian War Lord KITCHENER was on

MODERN IMPRESSIONIST ART-THE GARDEN PARTY.
the side of the French. It was the
same in the procession the other day.
It was inevitable that some persons
should be disappointed with the pro-
cession, for, up to the last moment, a
comparatively brisk business had been
done by unscrupulous hawkers in
Panoramas of the Coronation Procession.
And the Lady from the Country who
left after seeing the Prince of WALES
drive by in his General's uniform, under
the impression that she had seen
KITCHENER, thought that very few of
the Warrior's portraits had quite caught
his likeness.
When the General himself passed,
the enthusiasm became intense. More-
over it proved infectious, and even a
German gentleman, carried away by
the excitement of the moment, was
heard to cry loudly, "Bravo BOPS!" to
KITCHENER.
In fact there was only one discordant
note. Ac Hyde Park Corner a stout
gentleman with a heavy gold watch-
chain hissed KITCHENER. He had had
his hat broken in on Peace Night.
When Lord ROBERTS returned from
South Africa, Lord KITCHENER was given
the local rank of General. After the
Banquet he was a full General.
In many instances the adaptation of
the Coronation devices to suit the
circumstances showed considerable
ingenuity. For example, in several
places one noticed that the initials
"E.R." had had the word " KITCHEN"
prefixed to them.
The current number of Every Girl's
Magazine contains, as a supplement, a
life-size portrait, in colours, of his
Lordship's moustache.
There is apparently to be a Comic
History of the War. Its coloured
frontispiece representing incidents in
the life of Lord KITCHENER, including
the signing of the Treaty of Peace in an
open tent, is now on sale, price one
shilling, and can be seen outside many
stationers' shops for nothing.
Owing to a recent accident in the
Lady's Realm, very few papers that
appeared on the previous Friday pub-
lished illustrations of Lord KITCHENER'S
reception on the following Saturday.
Lord KITCHENER haa expressed his
regret that he arrived back too late to
take part in the QUEEN'S Tea to the
other "Generals."
It is rumoured that there is already
friction between Lord KITCHENER and
the War Office. The War Office
authorities, it seems, were extremely
annoyed that Lord KITCHENER arrived at
Paddington punctually. They accuse
him of riding rough-shod over their
traditions.
The real reason why KITCHENER hurried
home is not generally known. He is to
attempt to restore order at Sandhurst.
It is realised that, if anyone can do it,
it is he.
We are pleased to be able to print a
full and verbatim report of the spee"
made by his Lordship to H.R.H. the
Prince of WALES at Paddington Station.
It was, "How do you do, Sir?"

No doubt in a few brief years the

Thus, for a Cook :—
"The Duchess of M ... would be

A brougham would always be at the

where in the evening."

"Lady N . . . would feel greatly

lady in the accomplishment of a little
light housework. In return for these
services Lady N . . . would be glad
to give, in addition to the full salary of

ever required."
For a Scullery-maid :—
"A lady is invited to place herself

For a Nursemaid :—
"The Countess J . . . hopes that
this advertisement may meet the eye of
some charitably disposed lady, who
would be willing to allow a little boy
and girl (both very quiet children) to
play around her for a few hours daily.
A considerable selection from current
fiction would always be at the lady's
disposal. If, moreover, it were not
making too great a tax on the lady's

esteem it a great favour if she (the lady)
would occasionally hold the baby in her

that those under whose authority chil-
dren are placed are peculiarly susceptible
to the fascinations of the military pro-
fession, the Countess J . . . would be
pleased to entertain any officer (general
or otherwise) whom the lady might
honour with her notice."
For a Lady's-maid :—
"The Honourable SOPHIA B . . .
is desirous of becoming acquainted
with a lady who has devoted some
attention to affairs of the toilet. The
Honourable SOPHIA B . . . ventures
to express confidence that she will be
able to satisfy any lady who may be
good enough to accord her an interview
that she is a person whom the lady
may quite properly come into daily

Autobiographies.)

To begin at the beginning I may say
tliat both my parents were Poles: hence
my personal magnetism. I was born
quite bald, but have taken care never to
be so since. The earliest musical experi-
ence I can recall is recognising a chord
of the submerged tenth, struck by my
father in an adjoining apartment while I
was being bathed in the nursery; but all
my early surroundings were melodious.
My aunt was a great performer on the
samovar; my uncle, who emigrated to
America along with SIENKIEVICZ, the
famous Polish novelist, used to imitate
the bobolink to perfection; while my
second cousin is a Hospodar. Hence I
grew up in a thoroughly musical
atmosphere.
o a » -a
It was not, however, decided imme-
diately that I was to become a pianist.
On my sixth birthday a family council
was held. One relative was for the
army, another for the navy, one for the
church, another for the bar, another for
the double bar. They could not agree;
words ran high; a Polish insurrection
seemed imminent, and the name of
KOSCIUSKO had more than once l)een
invoked when I slipped to the piano,
climbed on the music stool, and played
the overture to Manru. Quiet was
instantly restored, and music from that
instant held undivided sway over me,
mitigated only by billiards and ping-
pong.
«? -a o e
My education was prolonged and ex-
haustive. After taking a Pole degree
in absentia at Cambridge I repaired to
the University of Warsaw to complete
my equipment for the battle of life.
There my chief teacher was LESCHETIZKY,
as is well known.
It is not, however, generally under-
stood that I worked at pugilism under
PODIEDONOSTZEFF and at pianofortitication
under KRAG-JORGENSEN. I also mastered
the theory of capillary attraction under
my dear Aunty MAKASSAROVITCH, nee
TATCHOSIMSKY, whose husband was the
famous explorer of the Hairy Ainus.
Last, but not least, I acquired the art
of hand-shaking under President CLEVE-
LAND.
• • • •
In those days I frequently practised
fifteen hours a day, and had to be
removed from the keyboard by wild
horses. On one occasion thej horses
forgot to come, and I remained hard at
work until the next morning. During
that night my hair turned auburn.
Still I persevered—with what result the
readers of P. A. P. need not to be reminded.
How well I remember my nervousness
at my debut! It was only by the
exercise of the greatest self-control that
I avoided a fiasco. Ten Cossacks of
the Ukraine fainted, and the hardy
denizens of the Blue Alsatian mountains
were melted to unfamiliar tears. It
was, as Sir LEWIS MORRIS remarks, a
triumphant day.
After that I was soon able to plav
any piano and composer with impunity.
As a mere matter of personal feeling,
however, I prefer a Krupp grand, with
a Harveyised steel resonator and bonzo-
line keys.

What more is there to tell? With
that triumphant moment I left boyhood
behind me. I. J. P.

that it would be impossible to exagger-
ate the undeservedness of the situation.
As far as his own side is concerned the
Liberal Party owe him a debt they can
never repay; to do them justice they
have never made attempt to meet it.
The only parallel in political history
of the last thirty years is found when
Lord HARTINGTON filled the gap in the
leadership created by the retirement of
Mr. GLADSTONE in 1874. The party
was then as little grateful as it has
proved in presence of the daily sacrifice
made by C.-B.
Like HARTINGTON in 1875, C.-B. in
1899 -would, if he had followed his own
inclination and personal interest, have
declined the thorny crown of leadership.
From simple sense of duty, impelled by
fealty to a cause in distress, he accepted
the post, and has ever since lived in
turmoil peculiarly painful to one of his
sunny nature. Oddest feature in the
situation is that, whilst he is not com-
forted and strengthened by the loyalty
of a united Party, he has been the specia
mark of enmity on the other side. In
the House, on the platform, in the Part}
press, kind-hearted, good-humoured
courteous, canny C.-B. has been the
^arget of contumely and scorn. This
ittitude was assumed in moment
of heat created by a luckless phrase,
criticising the conduct of British troops
n the field. There has been nothing
Ise either in uttered speech or habitual
attitude to justify the personally bitter
tone of the Ministerialists.
This made it all the more pleasant
o-night to find from that quarter of
he House recognition of the true C.-B.
-lis simple words of welcome hailing
PRINCE ARTHUR, wearing for the first time
the laurel wreath of the Premiership,
went straight home to every heart.
His bold breach of order, making his
.ittle speech whilst questions were still
n progress, added to the effect.
There was really nothing new in this;
t was the same C.-B., victim of con-
stant wrangling in the home circle,
object of angry abuse abroad. His
unaffectedly simple, hearty speech was
leard again a few minutes later in
tribute to the MARKISS. His first uncon-
ventional interposition gave the true
note to an incident that showed the
3ouse of Commons at its best; party
strife lulled in admiration, almost
affectionate esteem, for a political foe;
the recipient of the priceless honour,
cynical man of the world, case-hardened
Parliamentarian, making response in
faltering voice with tear-dimmed eyes.
PRINCE ARTHUR'S halting words, "In
fact, I am quite incapable of saying
what I feel, were worth more than
balf-an-hour's ordered speech rounded
off by brilliant peroration.
Business done.—The MARKISS hands
the Premiership over to PRINCE ARTHUR,

Well, not to put too fine a point on
it, he wasn't here. Some men newly
set in high position, fearful of being
late, would have been fussing round s
quarter of an hour before the appointed

came to the conclusion he wasn't
wanted. Something about "facilities
and inducements to British subjects
both male and female, to settle in South
Africa." CAMPERDOWN had question on
the paper; ONSLOW, representing Colonia
Office, would answer it. COUNTY GUY
knew nothing about it. Why anyone
in this hot weather should want to
settle in South Africa was, when b
came to begin to think he was thinking

more common in the House of Lords
than to see the PREMIER and the LORD
CBANCELLOR hobnobbing on the Wool-
sack, apparently telling each other risque
stories. Once a scene of some embarrass-
ment followed on the habit. The Order
Paper contained very little public busi-
ness. But there were two Bills with
which it was proposed to make progress.
The MARKISS and the LORD CHANCELLOR,
seated on the Woolsack, chuckling
together for fully ten minutes, did not
notice approach of the hand of the
clock to naif-past four, when public
business begins. It was the LORD
CHANCELLOR'S turn to tell a story. The
MARKISS was bending his head towards
him, his countenance wrinkled with
rare laughter, the story evidently just
coming to the point, when through the
silent Chamber boomed Big Ben sound-
ing the half-hour. The MARKISS rose
with surprising swiftness, ambled back
to his place, and without resuming his
seat said, "I move that the House do
now adjourn."
"The question is," said the LORD
CHANCELLOR, gravity settling upon him
like a cloud on sunlit Himalaya, "that
this House do now adjourn. Those of

'Not Content.' The Contents have it."

CRUMBS FOR CRICKETERS.
It.—FROM OUR OWN FRYING-PAN.
THE Loamshire and Diddlesex match
is admittedly an affair of world-wide
importance. And so, Mr. Punch, you
did well to follow the novel plan of
some of your contemporaries, by obtain-
ing an account of it from one taking an
actual part in the game; one, moreover,
who was unquestionably the finest
player on either side. Personally, I
loathe self-advertisement. There is no
subject that I would write on less
willingly than that of my own deeds in
the cricket field, marvellous and unique
as these are. And this almost morbid
modesty of mine will explain the
absence of any reference to myself in
the following notes. Despite your own
urgent wishes and those of my count-
less readers, I must confine my remarks
to a plain and straightforward account
of the Diddlesex and Loamshire match.
I was born in London on the 31st of
September, 187—-no, I will not give the
precise year. Thousands of readers
hunger to learn it, but the modern craze
for personal journalism is an unmixed
evil. (Besides, you can find the date for
yourself in Wisden.) At the age of two
years and three months I made my first
century, completely collaring my nurse's
bowling and placing her length-balls be-
tween the coal-scuttle and the bedstead.
The bat I used on this historic occasion
has been presented to theBritishMuseum.
Entering the football arena at the age of
three .... [Forty lines of autobiogra-
phical matter are unavoidably omitted.
—ED.] .... though I always liked
French mustard better than the English
variety. This last piece of news, never
hitherto published, is copyrighted in
the United States and elsewhere.
But it is to the Diddlesex and Loam-
shire match that my attention must be
strictly limited to-day. My side won
the toss, and two Diddlesex batsmen,
quite passable players in their own
styles, opened our innings. I rather
fancy that they made a fair number of
runs, but I 'm not sure about this, and
anyhow it doesn't matter. Sooner or
later, however, one of them was dis-
missed, and I filled the vacancy. I was
wearing my Free Foresters' cap, which,
by the way, has a rather curious history
attached to it. [Twenty-five lines deleted
here.—ED.]
To resume. Facing me was JOHN
YORKER, far and away the finest bowler
in England. His second ball would
have turned in slightly from the off,
and I should have cut it for three. His
third would have gone away with his
arm, and I fancy that I should have
been satisfied with a snick to the
boundary, placed just out of long-slip's
reach. The fourth and fifth, being
irdinary good-length balls, I should
bave been content to drive for a couple
each. But the last of the over, which
would have been a trifle slower and
with a leg-break on it, I should have
lifted clean out of the ground for six.
This would have been an enjoyable
performance—though absurdly easy to
me—so it was a great misfortune that
the first ball of the over upset my middle
stump. It curled in the air, broke both
ways, kept low and bumped. I had
made every arrangement for despatching
t to the pavilion, when, at the last
moment, its course was slightly deflected
)j a blade of grass, and my calculations
vvere upset—like my middle stump. So
suzzled was I by this occurrence, that in
lie second innings, from pure absence
of mind, I gave point a catch (which he
ield) before, instead of after, I had
compiled two or three hundred runs.
The rest of the game was quite un-
•emarkable, and calls for no comment.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday^ July 14.—Not a very remarkable nor particu-
arly distinguished gathering to meet Her Highness La
•'rincesse Osra, "opera romantique en trois actes d'apres
LNTHONY HOPE "—why not ANTOINE ESPERANCE ?" Poeme de
IADRICE BERENGER" (very near BERANGER, only a difference);
'traduction anglaise de R. H. ELKIN "; and last, but not
east, where an opera is in question, "Musique de HERBERT
SUNNING." Difficult to Frenchify this last name: something
>eculiarly English about "BuNNiNG." Clearly an appro-
mate name for the composer of a "cake-walk." But
"Cease your funning,"
Come to BUNNINO,
ind let us know what he has done for us and for the musi-
;al world in general. Let us hope that he has not " done for
limself" in this operatic effort. To begin with, it could not
lave had a more satisfactory cast, as MARY-MxRY-quite-
:ontrary-GARDEN sang charmingly as the Princess, and
If. MARECHAL was as good a Stephane (I am supposing my
•eader to be thoroughly acquainted with the story as writ by
\KTOINE ESPERANCE) as anyone could wish to hear. PLANCON
,he Perfect did his best, but the part gives but small scope
'or an artistic basso who will be ever memorable in the
•ecollection of opera-goers as an admirable Mephistophelea
ind perfect Friar Laurence.
But who can decide on the merits, for it is full of merit,
)f an opera entirely new to the hearer, at a single sitting?
As it takes two to make a quarrel, so ought it to take two
:ritics, one dramatic and t'other musical, to deal, at one
learing, with the libretto and music of a new opera; and
sven then there should be a "third person present," who,
being neither simply djramatic nor merely musical, but a
master of both arts and a slave to nobody, would have the
casting vote, and give his decision, from which there should
be no appeal, except to the ultimate tribunal of the public.
It was well received, and HERBERT BUNKING, being called,
:ame, and in accepting the cake of warm congratulations,
looked decidedly pleased. Here 's luck to BUNKING, who 's
in the running.
Friday night.—Second hearing of Princesse Osra, and
Erst of Miss E. M. SMYTH'S opera Der Wold, which—being
translated in the programme, the title having been made in
Germany—is understood as in plain English The Forest.
Anyone wishing to learn all about this clever composeress
must not consult Smith's Smyth-ology, as she is a very real
person, about whom much that is most interesting will be
found in the Musical Notes of the Westminster Gazette of
Friday last. To-night "place aux dames," and BUNNING,
who has achieved his success, yields the pas to the First
Lady-Operatic Composer and Librettist whose work has
been performed at Covent Garden. Der Wald is in one act
and one scene, a charming sylvan "set." The plot, as
illustrated by the dramatis personal, may be fairly described
aa of the "Penny-plain-and-Twopence-coloured " order. As
the entire action turns on the discovery, in a well, of a
dead stag which had been hidden there by the poacher
Heinrich, Herr PENNARINI, and his young woman Hoschen
(prettily played and well sung by Frau LOHSE), the second
title of the piece might fitly have been " Oh dear, what can
the matter be?" There is in it a thoroughly novel dance
to a movement full of life and tune. But after this the
opera seems to consist of interminable duetts, the second
of them being the best. Mile. FREMSTAD powerful as the
wicked lolanthe, a name that recalls GILBERT and SULLIVAN,
and this opera, as did that of the Savoyards, begins and
ends with fairies whose presence, in the words of the immortal
Toots, is "of no consequence, thank you." Miss SMYTH was
acclaimed vociferously, the Duke of CONNAUGHT and the occu-
pants of the Royal Box testifying their great pleasure a
vhat may come to be, after judicious elimination, a satis-
iactory success.
La Princesse Osra followed, admirably played and sung
jy Miss MARY GARDEN, Mile. MAUBOURG, Messrs. MARECHAL,
PLANCON and all concerned. The mise-en-scene is excellent;
. BARKER'S Throne Room perfect. Musically it is dis-
appointing, save for accidental reminiscences.
To return for a final word to Der Wald. In the book there
is this delightful stage direction,—"All dance: suddenly
from the wood a weird hornJ>last is heard. AU merriment
instantly ceases. Dead silence. The Peasants turn pale."
This last direction is lovely. Imagine the stage-manager
at rehearsal stamping his foot and exclaiming, "Now,
peasants! You 've not 'turned pale,' you know. Can't
you turn pale? Now then, once again; you 're all singing
md dancing, merry as grigs; then you hear the horn—see?
then you all stop dead. Then you 'turn pale.' No! no!
that's not a bit like it! Try it again!" And so forth. Not
even Mr. PUFF himself, in his great drama of The Spanish
Armada, could possibly have conceived a more striking
stage-direction.
MORITURI SALUTANT!

WE are the People, and wisdom shall die with Us,

No other nation can possibly vie with us
Either in Letters, or Science, or Art!
Twenty years hence, 'tis the general opinion

All will acknowledge Columbia's dominion,
Both in the moral and physical plane.
None of the Peoples who flourished before us
Showed from the first such remarkable powers,
So let us sing in unanimous chorus,
"We are the People! The Future is Ours!
We are, in fact, the fine flower of Humanity.
Where—save with us—can true Progress be found?
Morals and even, I fear, Christianity,
Scarcely exist in the nations around.
Art doesn't thrive in the Peoples about us,
But for our help it would probably die,
Painting would certainly perish without us,
Painters would starve if New York didn't buy.
Whether in poetry, drama or fiction,
Or in Philosophy, still we excel,
Note our remarkably elegant diction,
Notice the masterly way that we spell.
Mark our advance in the physical sciences,
Note the inventions we give to mankind,
Think of the many ingenious appliances
Due to the nimble American mind!
Europe, poor thing, can you wonder we scorn her,
Passed in the race and left lagging behind?
When we invented the Trust and the Corner,
Oh what a boon we bestowed on mankind!
Picture how Commerce was sunk in dejection,
Striving in vain to dispose of its wares,
Till these devices were brought to perfection
By the resource of our millionaires.
What is the hope, then, for civilisation?
What is the cure for a century's tears?
What—save the mighty American Nation?
That is the obvious answer. Three cheers!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"NOW, MY DEAR FELLOW, WHAT 13 THE GOOD OF SITTING THERE ON A BEAUTIFUL MORNING LIKE THIS?"
"Aw—I DON'T KNOW—IT'S BETTER THAN DOIN' NOTHING!"
AN HONORARY GARDENER'S REMINISCENCES.
1. Tlie Literature of the Garden.—I commenced my
career as a gardener by a wide course of literature. There
was a certain similarity of title as well as contents among
these works; but what is written for gardeners, gardeners
must read. There was "Gardening," "All about Garden-
ing," "Successful Gardening," "The Garden," "My Gar-
den," " Our Gardens," " Amateur Gardening," " Gardening
for Amateurs," "Garden Plants," "The Plants of the Garden,"
and a work of sinister omen, "Garden Foes." I studied
this last first, and trembled. Remedies were suggested for
battling with the foe, it is true, but faint hopes were held out
for a successful issue from the gardener's point of view.
There was the slug, who placidly consumed seedlings;
the aphis, who increased at the rate of 27 billions in three
generations, and supported herself and families during this
tiresome operation bydevouring the choicest roses. Forthe rose
there was also the grub, mildew, and (by way of an extra luxury
for the greenhouse) the mealy bug. For the ordinary flower
border there was the May frost, drought, over-watering,
tomtits for the polyanthus, sparrows for the crocus, a myriad
host of worms, wireworms, ants, flies, beetles, earwigs,
caterpillars—and, to crown all, the unspeakable cat.
I turned for consolation to the other books. They treated
of the health of body, the peace—even rapture—of mind to
be gained by the amateur gardener. I read of bulbs and
bastard-trenching, of mulching, of basic slag and guano, of
the Dutch hoe and the trug basket. Then I rose to the
more spiritual side of the subject, and read of the Countess
who broke out of her own pantry window at four o'clock in
i the morning to see if dewdrops really trembled in the dawn;
of the poet who spoke prose whenever he walked in his
garden with ladies; and of the daring people who strive to
bring about the downfall of the scarlet "geranium."
2. The Work of the Garden.—Thus inspired, I dug, I
hoed, I clipped, I pruned, I mulched with manures of the
most poignant odours. All the garden foes arrived with
frightful punctuality, and more than fulfilled what I had
been led to expect of them. I am convinced that my
aphides increased at the rate of 90 billions per three genera-
tions, instead of only 27 billions. Such seedlings as were
spared from sheer lack of appetite by the surfeited slugs
perished by my own hand under mistaken applications of
soot; while many a plant fell a victim to the virulent
insecticides with which I syringed it.
3. The Obliteration of the Garden.—At length I rose in
revolt. I engaged a man with a plough and a team of
powerful horses, and caused him to plough slowly and
thoroughly through every border in my garden. Then I
collected the literature and sent it in a sack to the nearest
rag-merchant.

LEFT YOUH SONGS AT HOME?"
Misa Sharp. "YES, DEAE. WHY?"
Dolly. "\VELL, PAPA SAYS 'IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE'!"
HINTS FOR AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS.
On Choosing a Subject.—All the world's your oyster,
especially if it be in rapid motion. No other art than yours
can seize the odorous, vaporous tail of the agitated motor-
car, or arrest in mid-air the brief repose of the cyclist who
dives from piej-ends. You will, however, endeavour to be
original. A charging bull taken end on—-the business end,
of course—makes a novel and spirited study, and one well
witliin the capacity of modern apparatus, provided it be
properly handled. The photograph should be taken from
the other side of the hedge, otherwise the negative will
probably be disfigured by holes that will require careful
retouching.
Of Composition.—This is a word used by arrogant painters
to describe their private re-arrangements of the universe. It
is, like Poetry, not a true thing. Have nothing to do with
it. Snap boldly in the face of Nature As She Is. She
won't mind. N.B. This does not apply to ladies at the sea-
side who are strangers to you.
Of Development.—Bear in mind that what happens is the
unexpected. If nothing happens, remember that all things
come to those who know how to wait.
Of Technical Terms.—Two or more different views taken
inadvertently upon the same plate may be called a composite
photograph. Figures which show absolutely and uniformly
black, owing to all the light having been on the far side,
may be termed silhouettes. The opportune use of these
expressions will be found essential in inducing your friends
to believe that the respective results were intended.
Of Toning Down.—If the portrait of the girl of your heart
comes out with a face suggestive of a coloured progenitor,
expatiate on the beauties of the background, and regret
parenthetically that she didn't take her hat off. If in any
print the horizon should show a marked tendency to assume
,he perpendicular, point out that only the most despicable
lypercriticism would condemn a work of art upon a charge
that may be entirely removed by holding the thing at a
suitable angle. If a picture shows such a want of definition
as to leave its subject in considerable doubt, commend its
tone, and explain that the sun went in—which, of course,
wasn't your fault—or label it frankly a moonlight effect.
Of Exposures.—None need be feared if a sufficient supply
of explanatory remarks similar to the above be kept in
stock.
THE MUSE AND THE POET.
Poet. At last! Don't trouble to explain—
The tube, no doubt, gone wrong again.
Muse. Oh, if you 're nasty and severe
I wish I had not hurried here.

If I had made it weeks, what then?
Could you without my aid have written
A single sentence, stolid Briton?
When I am absent, well you know
Your fountain pen forgets to flow.
Poet. To work, then! Take your hat off, won't you?
Muse. You think it rather pretty, don't you?
Poet. The hat? What's wrong with it? I thought it-
Muse. I Ve only just this instant bought it—
Poet. Whilst I was sitting fuming here—
Muse. But tell me, don't you like it, dear?
Poet. Well, yes, it's—
Muse. Thanks! And now, confess,
You rather like my muslin dress?
It suits me?
Poet. Yes. But what a skirt
For Fleet Street smoke and Fleet Street dirt!

To wear in this disgusting city.
The scent of hay is on the breeze;

And cool blue waters lapping sweetly—
Come! I desire the " Swan" at Streatley!
I '11 teach you to sing of the river
(Sing hey! for a heaven of blue !)
With silvery willows a-quiver
(Sing ho! for a heart that is true !)
I '11 show you the Zephyrs a-playing
And setting the rushes a-swaying—
Hark! hark! I can hear what they 're saying
Above our Canader canoe.
"Oh, Summer the season for bliss is
(Sing hey! for a heaven of blue!)
For laughter and courting and kisses
(Sing ho! for a heart that is true!)
Come, paddle your sweet little lady
Down backwaters sheltered and shady,
Or lie at your ease, like a Cadi,
As we waft your Canader canoe.
"There 's nowhere Love dallies so sweetly
(Sing hey! for a heaven of blue!)
As under the willows at Streatley
(Sing ho! for a heart that is true!)
Here PHYLLIS and STEEPHON are straying,
Here youth is for ever a-maying"
Hark! hark! I can hear what they 're saying
Above our Canader—can you?

And your sparkling eyes of jet
Made me stare
As you dawned upon my sight
In your gown of blue aud white,
With the bow of ribbon bright
In your hair.
Yet, alas !—I fear those curls

Once adorned another girl's
Shapely head;
While your cheeks—it gives me pain —

Of a heavy shower of rain
On their red.

A DUKE ON "NATURE-STUDY."
As some doubts have been cast, owing to the ambiguity
of its title, on the propriety of the '' Nature-Study Exhibition ''
at the Botanical Gardens, for which the Duke of DEVONSHIRE
pronounced the opening address on Wednesday last, we are
glad to explain that it was not an exhibition of ttudes
artistiques d'apres la vie, in the human sense, but of pre-
served specimens of still life in the animal and vegetable
world, and other objects illustrative of the advantages of
rural observation. The report of the DUKE'S speech, as
given by Our Special Commissioner, differs so materially
from those published by the daily papers that we print it
with the utmost reserve. It is as follows:
The Duke of DEVONSHIRE, rising punctually on the List
note of the lecture-desk alarum, said:
My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, As President of
the Board of Education, it is my—er—privilege to call your
attention to a new departure (of which I am credibly
informed) in the direction of rendering the education of
the young in our rural districts more consonant with their
environment. One cannot be too much—er—awake (here the
DUKE suppressed a yawn) to the desirability of direct ocular
investigation of the facts of Nature. Of the value of book-
knowledge, already recognised by the Department, I will
not speak with—er—disrespect. There are certain pheno-
mena about which, whether they have ceased to occur or
are still beyond the range of human observation, we are
dependent upon books for exact information. Thus the—er
—nuptials of the queen-bee, which take place, as I under-
stand, in the neighbourhood of the empyrean beyond the
reach of the loftiest L.C.C. fire-ladder, and have never been
witnessed by the eye of any mortal wedding-guest, are
described in very eloquent language in one of the philosophic
works of—er—(thank you) of M. MAETERLINCK.
On the other hand, in a large, though—er—unfortu-
nately decreasing, number of instances, the material of books
has been derived from the immediate observation of facts.
Second-hand information, however, while indispensable to
the conduct of affairs, domestic as well as—er—political, is
never so convincing as that which is derived from a study
of the actual—er—objects themselves.
My own earliest—er—tastes lay in the direction of the
pursuit of butterflies and the collating of the better class of
beetles, or—er—coleoptera; and nothing short of the exi-
gencies of a public career could appreciably have curtailed
my—er—passionate predilection for a closer acquaintance with
the habits and-/er—manifestations of the natural world. The
unparalleled stress of work which has recently been thrown
upon me in my novel position as Leader of the—er—Upper
Chamber (respectful applause) has precluded me from
refreshing my memory in these—er—departments of rural
knowledge. I am indebted, however, to my friend Sir JOHN
AVEBURY—er—that is to say, to my noble friend Lord
LUBBOCK, who not only is the author of the Hundred Best
Books, but has devoted himself from time to time with an
energy which commands my profound—er—admiration to the
study of natural phenomena, for very kindly correcting
this hiatus by supplying me with a few of his general
observations on these and—er—cognate themes.
I cannot, perhaps, do better than peruse aloud the less
recondite portions of the text of his—er—monograph. I
have, by the way, an especial and almost—er—-personal
pleasure in calling your attention to his comments on the
condition of coma which is natural to the chrysalis.
[Here the DUKE began to read from the manuscript of Lord
AVEBURY.]
"It is not generally known that insects can converse with
one another. The same is only less true of flowers. But
the single established instance of conversation between these
two branches of the natural world is the case of the Honey-
suckle and the Bee.
It has been often said that even a worm will turn; but
we are seldom told in what direction it will perform this
movement. In the case of a silkworm the answer is plain.
It turns into a chrysalis.
Sleep has been called the restorer of Nature. YOUNG, in
his '' Night Thoughts,'' described it as " balmy.'' This is the
reason why you should not attempt to defeat its purposes
by rousing the chrysalis before its time. In due course it
will wake up and become a butterfly or a moth.
Moths are of different kinds. SHELLEY spoke of " the desire
of the moth for the star." Some moths have less exalted
ambitions. OUIDA has written a treatise on the latter.
We have all heard of the Sensitive Plant (SHELLEY again).
Yet Nature has made the lower creation less susceptible to
pain than you might imagine. It is surprising how soon a
daisy will pick up after being subjected to the pressure of
a garden roller.
Also, I have read, in a scientific work, of a beetle that was
siipposed to have died under an anaesthetic, and was subse-
quently transfixed by a pin and secured among other speci-
mens in a box. Yet the next morning it was found that he
had got up in the night and eaten the rest of the collection.
(Cheers.)
Still, one should not take advantage of this apparent
callousness. COLERIDGE has some true words on the right
treatment of "bird and beast " (including man). The case
of the Ancient Mariner is a terrible warning to any who are
tempted to collect albatrosses.
Chestnuts came over with WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, who
gave his own title to the game which our youth plays with
them. There are eating chestnuts, and there are the other
kind that are not fit to swallow. The technical name for
this class is Josephus Millerius. I hope to furnish a few
exhibits of this species.
Cricket is both a game and an insect. I was once walking
down the Strand in search of a late edition of the papers
with news from the seat of war, when my eye was arrested
by the announcement of a poster which ran as follows:
LOCKWOOD'S
GREAT
BOWLING
FEAT.
These would, of course, be fatal to any cricket on the hearth
(DICKENS).
Moral and social lessons may be learned from the vegetable
world. Potatoes are an exception, as they generally take their
place at table with their coats off.
As an example of the better sort, you will find many
flowers that naturally shut up when they have given out
sufficient beauty for one day. How well for us if their
teaching were followed by our Members of Parliament!"
[Loud and prolonged applause, during which the DDKE
resumed his nap. 0. S.

NO FLIES.

THE fly has flown! But though at this
The hairless wag their heads to-day,
The nimble boy will sorely miss
His wonted prey.
The fly has vanished into space,
We miss his dear familiar feet,
Aud spiders say no daily grace
For daily meat!
The fly is not! And men who sell
The poisoned sheet, the sticky thread
Must, sadly weeping, say, " 'Twere well
We too were dead."
The fly has gone! Tims sadly go—
We can but mutely wonder why—
The tokens that we used to know
Our summer by.
Yet there is balm for every ill;
All joy and comfort will not flee
The while the honeysuckle still
Attracts the bee.
And some may thank a lucky star
That good disguised is offered thus—
Who say in classic phrase, "There are
No flies on us."
THE NOVELTY SYNDICATE.
(By Mr. Punch's Imaginative Reporter?)
THIS is a remarkable venture (Mr.
PiEitPONr MORGAN is out of the running
altogether), its aim being—in the words
of the prospectus—to introduce into Art,
Literature and Science, those occult
methods which have brought about
commercial success in such under-
takings as musical comedies. What is
the triumph of the new century V
Musical comedy, of course, as every
schoolgirl knows. And why? Because,
say its admirers, it provides a light,
hright and attractive form of entertain-
ment which revives the mind jaded by
worry and scurry. The Novelty Syndi-
cate, however, claims to have discovered
another and the real secret of its popu-
larity. According to this august and
potent body, the success of musical
comedy is due to its unexpectedness.
For is it not the work of about half-a-
dozen writers to start with? Can you
guess from the choruses the probable
treatment of the topical songs and
duets? Can you even gauge from the
timefulness of one the melody (or want
of melody, maybe) of another? Of
course not! They are the work of
different hands. From the dialogue
you rise bewildered in your attempts
to discover a special point of view:
there are a dozen points of view—
not to mention a good many views
that have no point. We have the
book" writer, as advertised — the
'

Charitable Person (who IMS been much impressed by the erudition of a plausible cadgrr).

stage manager — the low comedian,
and so on. Are you acquainted with
the dramatic unities? Are you experi-
enced in the ways of life? Don't let
this trouble you. Musical comedy has
nothing to do with any probable phase
of drama or life, and it only resembles
—itself. This is the secret as I have
gathered it from the capitalists of the
Novelty Syndicate. They intend to
apply it generally. And in the first
place they will run fiction on these lines.
"The publishers complain," mur-
mured the General Manager of the
Syndicate to me, "that fiction is risky
and unsatisfactory from the commercial
point of view. Let them wait and
watch our method."
"For instance, here is a rough sug-
gestion which the Syndicate will shortly
act upon. Sensation, Gush and Some
Glitter. A Romance of Modern Life.

Syndicate will be presented in due
course, but this one was sufficiently
immense for my mind to grasp at once.

THE BANKS OF THE LEE.
I MET some good fellows a short time ago;
With the fire of true friendship their hearts were aglow;
And it's oh but they took of good whisky no end,
With a fist for a foe and a hand for a friend.
And my soul says, "Here 'a luck, wheresoever they be,
To the great men I met on the banks of the Lee.
Oh their songs on the Lee (and it's sweetly they sang),
How they went with a swing, how they closed with a bang!
They toasted old Erin, the brave and the gay,
Till the night faded out, and, behold, it was day.
And at last—oh, a louder I shall not hear soon—
Came a forty-voice chorus with twenty in tune.
If 'twas laughter you longed for or friendship you sought,
They were both to be had, but they couldn't be bought.
You were called on to pay—it was only in part—
With a laugh of your own and a show of your heart.
Oh this—and we gave it—is always the fee
That they ask for their love on the banks of the Lee.
There was one, a Chief Justice—he didn't live there,
But he came mighty grand from the County of Clare.
"Brother ANDREWS," says he, as he sat in his Court,
"I think," says old PETER, '-' we '11 cut the thing short.
If we leave the Court now we can all of us see
The races they row on the tide of the Lee."
Another—and soon may I see him again!—
He was always on hand with a glass of champagne;
And all the blue devils that make you repine
He could drown, and he did, in a bumper of wine.
If you stopped for a moment, "I 'm Sheriff," says he,
"And I '11 make you drink fair on the banks of the Lee."
There was fun and divarsion from morning to night,
And the smile of the girls 'twas a sunbeam for light.
Their eyes were like sapphires, their teeth were like pearls,
And it's Cork on the Lee that's the city for girls—
Oh, they spoke us and joked us so frank and so free,
That we wished to stay on by the banks of the Lee.
There was work for the glass, for the knife and the fork,
There was work for dry throats in the City of Cork;
And whatever they did. at the end of their meals
There was one thing they didn't—they never tapped heels.
So here 's love and good luck with a thirty times three
From the banks of vie Thames to the men of the Lee.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN Jim Twelves (METHUEN), Mr. W. F. SHANNON has
created a delightful character. Not absolutely novel in its
conception, but new in several ways. Jim is an A.B. on
H.M.S. Pimpernel. He finds a chum in Malachi Eaves,
almost equally original; both redolent of the sea and the
fo'castle. Jim is an optimist; Eaves a pessimist. Between
them they freely discuss life on board ship, their officers,
their work, and, betimes, that awful entity, a sort of deity
ashore, the Adm'alty. "What's the Adm'alty for?" asks
Eaves, in one of his moments of despondency. "The
Adm'alty," said Twelves, slightly raising his voice BO that
the Admiralty might hear, "the Adm'alty is for to look
after the lower deck as much as it can, because on that,
wid the wardroom and the good providence of God, the
kingdom chiefly depends." "Then the kingdom will be
let in," said Eaves. There is a long story describing the
A.B.'s adventures in the neighbourhood of Zanzibar. But
my Barouite is not certain that the best thing in the book
is not found among the shorter tales at the end, one relating
to the life and death of "A Certain Jacker."
Sladen's London and its Leaders (SANDS) is an attempt to
boil down Who's Who, presenting it with the attraction of
lower price and the addition of many portraits and illustra-
tions. Since it was Mr. DOUGLAS SLADEN who resuscitated that
indispensable volume, it is obvious that no one better could
take up the new task. The main idea is to give the names
and addresses of the leading people in London, including
officials, hostesses, Members of the House of Commons, and
other "entertainers." Leading clubs and leading shops
are not omitted. THE BARON DC BOOK-WORKS.
AN IMAGINARY CORRESPONDENCE.
(Which may be supposed to have passed between the Editor
of the "Quarterly Review" and Mr. A. C. Swinburne
when the proofs of the latter's signed article on Charles
Dickens were being revised for the press.)
DEAR SIR,—In going through the proofs of your valuable
article on DICKENS I came across the expression "Blatant
Booby." As the application of this description to persona
from whom one may differ in opinion is somewhat unusual
in modern literary controversy, perhaps you might like to
modify it? Yours faithfully,
. . . • . THE EDITOR.
DEAR SIR,—I utterly -and en-tirely refuse and decline to
make or accept, any change or alteration whatsoever in the
expression you mention. When I think a man a "booby"
I call him a "booby." Yours faithfully,.
A. C. SWINBCBNE.
DEAR SIR,—In writing of Mr. ANDREW LANG'S prefaces to
DICKENS I see you say, "The offence becomes an outrage,
the impertinence becomes impudence, when such rubbish is
shot down before the doorstep of CHARLES DICKENS." Is not
this rather too strong a description? Yours faithfully,
THE EDITOR.
DEAR SIR,—Certainly not! In this epicene age, when the
cautious criticaster bedecks and beslavers the words and
works of every imbecile impostor, it is utterly right arid
entirely necessary that such expressions should be used. A
short shift and a lang drop for such fellows!
Youra ferociously,
A. C. SWINBURNE.
DEAR SIR,—In your "DICKENS " article I see you speak of
"the chattering duncery and the impudent malignity of so
consummate and pseudo-sophical a quack as GEORGE HENRY
LEWES." You also write of the same gentleman's "insolent
and idiotic impeachments." Could you see your way to
toning down these expressions, as they are calculated to give
pain to many? Yours faithfully,
THE EDITOR.
SIR !—The suggestion that I should mar or modify the
nervous intensity and virile vigour of my incomparable style
to placate the prejudices or soothe the susceptibilities of a
plethoric public is incompetent and idiotic. Nor would the
public thank me for complying with that inane suggestion.
To whittle away and water down my virulent vituperation
and vehement invective would deprive my article of the
peculiar flavour which differentiates it from the critical
utterances of the groundlings. There is really nothing to
say about CHARLES DICKENS that has not been said fifty times
over already. All that can be done is to say it in a
thoroughly trenchant manner. This I have set myself to
do. And the fellow who says I have not done it is a blatant
booby, an arrant ass, a preposterous pedant, and an incom-
parable imbecile. Yours in a towering passion,
A. C. SWINBURNE.

(With

THE deep knell of the dinner gong
had scarcely ceased to reverberate round
the stately marble and porphyry corners
of the atrium of the Palazzo Gosso as
SUSANNA skipped the_ last six steps of
the alabaster staircase.
"Ecco!" she cried in a deep, pene-
trating, sonorous contralto.
"The evenin' peepers hev not yet
arraived," simpered a tall English
footman, with the finical enunciation of
flunkeydom.
She turned upon him her eyes-
purple velvet, hazed with gold—with
an expression in them at once beseech-
ing and domineering, but full of raillery
—or was it contempt? Then, taking
from the golden salver which he held
a tall amphora of lapis lazuli filled to
the brim with drinking water, she sud-
denly raised it to her head and tilted
it forward. The water leaped forth in
a pellucid arc—like a rainbow all too
young and immaculate to flaunt in
prismatic colours—and presently the
mosaic floor was flooded.
"Now we can talk—now that there 's
water between us !" she cried with a full
rich laugh, which sounded like an
impromptu by PALESTRINA (and the
raillery still in her eyes—or was it
mockery?) to her uncle, the old Com-
mendatore, who stood the other side
of the extemporised lagoon, turning up
the bottoms of his calzoni lunghi.
"I am of age!" she exclaimed, on a
key of petulance. "I was born at 7 P.M.
j ust twenty-one years ago! So 1 'm off
—Zio mio—to see the world!" And
she waved in the air a tiny white hand
which looked as if it smelt—faintly,
hauntingly—of some Cardinal's snuff-
box.
"Confondete la mia parrucca!"
gasped the old Commendatore in his
beard.
CHAPTER II.
The miasma which hung over the pri
sale surrounding Craford Manor was
blue with the language of the fly-man
who had driven ANTHONY home from the
station. He had been rewarded with a
Roumanian three-franc piece.
"What men dare do—what men daily
do—not knowing whom they do!"
mused ANTHONY as he lowered the port-
cullis between himself and the irate
mccliiere, and entered the oak-panelled
hall.
"Houp-la!" sang out a rich baritone
voice—and ADRIAN, ANTHONY'S secretary,
entered by a back somersault. He was
a stout, middle-aged man, with eyes
like star sapphires, and bright magenta
hair. He was dressed in loosely-fitting
clothes with large buttons, like puff-
balls, and he wore a white pyramidal
felt hat. He gave forth a genial smell
of rum—which he attributed to the fact
that he had recently shaved. His face
was still covered with powder—all but
his little pink nose, which stood forth
in contrast to the white around it, like
the ace of diamonds. On the gleaming
tip of it he now proceeded to balance a
peacock's feather, which nodded this
way and that as he ambled round the
room with a peculiar gait of his own,
his eyes fixed on the swaying end of
the lustrous plume.
"Oh, my dearie dear!" he cried.
"My popsie-wopsie! No wonder I had
pins and needles all last night! You 've
come back—I knew you would—referred
to Drawer!' Our courteous ANTONY—
whom ne'er the word of "No" woman
heard speak!' Dash my dimples! You
don't know what I 've done—the world
knows nothing of its greatest house-
agents! I 've a great mind not to tell
you—but I will because I 'm so benevo-
lent. I love myself with a ' B' because
I am as bountiful as I am beautiful.
And when I 've told you, you shall buy
me a bunch of brown ribbon to tie up
my bonny blue eyes!"
"I can't think why you were chris-
tened ADRIAN," cried ANTHONY, on a key
of expostulation. "Your name always
reminds me of the clever person in
Richard Feverel: and the contrast must
be so painful for you. However, go
ahead, dimple chin!" ANTHONY had
inherited from a long line of ancestors
the priceless gift of knowing how to
talk to his inferiors.
"' Go ahead,' quo' he, as though one
were a penny steamer!'' retorted the
other, making a moue as he spoke, and
ignoring the allusion to the original
ADRIAN. "But in wrath I '11 remember
mercy—and I '11 take your curiosity off
the rack. I 've let the second floor back!"
"I stand dumb with admiration,"
said ANTHONY.
"And to a lady—a lady of title,"
cried ADRIAN; "la Duchessa di PAQQIO-
BUNCO!"
ANTHONY quivered from head to foot
and gave a low whinny. He had had
an American ancestor who came over in
the Mayflower on her return trip, and
the very sound of a title gave him a
definite, undefinable aesthetic sensation.
Meanwhile ADRIAN had seated himself
at the Pianola, and was pouring his
whole soul into the instrument by means
of the side lever:
"D* ye ken JOHN LANE in his coat so jay,
Cardinal—yellow—and roees gray?"
be trolled, in his rich syrupy voice. But
ANTHONY'S mind was far away—in the
second-floor back. And he whispered
to himself, "La donna & nobile!"

THE TYRANNY OF TEARS.
[The Family Thttor declares that the action ol
tears on the eye is beneficial.]
DAPHNE, in tears your tyranny
You long have wielded over me.
But now at length their potent sway
I am resolved to disobey,
And from your yoke to struggle froe.
Why should your weeping me dis-
may?
Since eyes but gain a brighter ray
And lustre—Doctors all agree—
DAPHNE, in tears.
Alas! however great may be
The relevancy of my plea,
But little does its logic weigh,
For—steel my bosom as I may- —
I yield directly when I see
DAPHNE in tears!
DIARY OF A MODERN "WOMAN."
[A Sydney journal prints an euay on TENNYSON
by a girl of the ripe age ef thirteen. In the ooune
of it she remarks: "TENNTSON'B works are rich
in legendary rtories, such as the ' L»dy of Shalott'
and ' The Idylls of the King.' The former of these
is a fairy tale I remember well in my childhood."

POSSIBLY such examples of precocity
may ere long become common, and
may, indeed, extend to children of even
less mature years. Should such be the
case, it is possible, that, if so sacred a
volume were ever to see the light of
day, a modern infant's diary might be
found to be something like this :•—
Monday.—What thoughts crowd in
on me to-day! My birthday. And I
am three years old. Ah, the passing of
the years! What are you growing into,
you woman of three? What does your
mirror tell you? Am I, I wonder, am
I what the world calls beautiful? I
wonder — dare I write the words — I
wonder if He thinks me beautiful!
Dear He! I met him this morning on
the promenade. He was with his nurse,
and—he smiled as we met. But it was
such an enigmatical smile. I wonder
if he was thinking of the old sweet
days. How he used to pull my toes!
Why, you foolish child, you are actually
blushing! Yet why should he care?
He has met lots of women in his time.
Men do not live to be four and still
keep young hearts But there!
we women were made to suffer.
Wednesday. — I saw him to-day.
Glad dear dearest day! They told me
I was wet when I came in, but I had
seen—felt no rain, had seen only the
sun shine—my Sun. He waved his
rattle to me. Oh, the music of the
sound! And he said "Goo," sweetest
of all words. Then he smiled! And
his smile made the whole world beauti-
ful, and the birds sang a new glad

HINTS FOR AMATEUR ARTISTS.
Of Paraphernalia.—-These are quite
indispensable. Any slight inconveni-
ence caused by the carrying about of a
small tent, a large palette, a compli-
cated easel, a sketching stool, half-a-
dozen canvases, a paint-box and a
maul-stick, will be amply compensated
by the distinction the possession of
these objects confers upon you. They
need not constantly be carried. Piled on
the top of your travelling trunks at the
railway station they should excite con-
siderable interest, especially amongst the
porters. You will of course prevent any
mistake on the part of the general public
as to the ownership of these articles by
frequent manifestations of anxiety about
their safety. It is unnecessary to remind
persons of genuinely artistic feeling
that such ownership carries with it an
obligation to dress in harmony with its
belongings. The style of the coiffure
in particular should l)e seen to.
Of Applied Art.—As the wall space
of most houses is limited, you will not
confine yourself to framed pictures. The
surface of a mirror, the seat of a music
stool, or the parchment of a tambourine
are excellent situations for a landscape
in the style of CLAUDE, an allegory after
WATTS, or a realistic bunch of grapes.
; Take no notice of benighted people who
point out that mirrors are made to
reflect, stools to be sat upon, and
tambourines to be thumped. Every-
body knows that.
Of Portraiture.—The portrait of any
friend or relative whose complacency is
positively in need of shaking up may
be advantageously attempted. Con-
sideration for the sufferings of sitters
will no doubt suggest to young ladies
the painting of their own portraits by
the aid of a looking-glass. Many great
artists did this.
. Of Colour.—If drawing is not your
strong point, you are probably a colourist.
In that case stick to sunsets and the
sea. The former, as doubtless you
have observed, are red and yellow, and
the latter is blue and green. To a
colourist unable to draw, these subjects,
especially in combination, offer great
scope.
Of Animal Painting.—Make copies
of the stags that figure in the pictures
of the late Sir E. LANDSEER. It is nearly
impossible to mistake a stag for any
other creature.
Of Getting Hung.—Upon all occasions
when presents are customary, the gift
of a work from your own brush in an
expensive frame will ensure this, pro-
vided you let it be understood you
intend paying the donee a visit after a
short but indefinite period.
Of Finish.—Never finish anything.
If you do, don't admit it.
TO A "STRENUOUS" MAID.
["CLABE," in Truth, alluding recently to the
revival of croquet as a scientific game, remarked
that it gives no time for loitering, with iu subtle
tactics and time limiU. Old SABAH BATTLE, she
added, was not more sternly set on " the rigour cf
the game " than is the new girl, to whatever pas-
time she turns her energetic atttntion.]
DEAU MADGE, with nerves so well con-
trolled,
And movements vigorously bold,
With health and strength in overplus,
You 're .nothing if not strenuous!
What time the mid-Victorian maid
Upon the lawn at croquet played,
She did not <shine—a trifler she !—
At croquet, but at coquetry!
But you, dear MADGE, have driven hence
Such dallying inconsequence;
Your prowess holds my heart in thrall,
Impetuous mallet, flying ball!
I watch at ping-pong your attack,
And tremble for my bric-a-brac!
In all, you have a single aim,
And that " the rigour of the game."
And yet—I trust to Time for cure—
The strenuous mood can scarce endure;
No, sweet eighteen! 'Twill pass away
In that great game you 've yet to play.
That you must play—yourself theprize—
With beating heart and downcast eyes;—
Ah, MADGE! you '11 be contented then
To leave " the strenuous life" to men!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FEOM TH« DIARY or TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 21.
—Still harping on Education Bill. Ye
Gentlemen of England who live at home

THE LIMPET.
It U rumoured that Lord H-lsb-ry intends to
atick to the Woolsack.
at ease, little do you know what a day's
work on Education Bill in Committee
means. Begins about half-past two in
afternoon; goes on till half-past seven;
surviving Members laid out in comatose
state till nine o'clock, when they buckle
to again and grind away till midnight.
Well enough for some of them who
steal away whilst speeches are made,
coming back at sound of Division bell
to run up their record in the Session's
divisions. But for PRINCE ARTHUR, always
at his post; for JOHN O'Gonsr, who
shares his drudgery without the refresh-
ment of occasional speech-making; for
the Chairman of Committees, always
alert, never knowing what moment he
may not be called upon to answer
conundrum; and for mere me, faithful
among the faithless found, the experi-
ence suggests comparison favourable to
a term of penal servitude.
To-night the bored Committee roused
itself for a moment of mad expectancy.
BROADHURST on his legs, speaking dis-
respectfully of the beneficed clergy;
suggesting dark design on the part of
HUGH CECIL. His thunderous talk
listened to with mild indifference till he
dropped the remark, "I have brought
with me a church organ."
Here was promise of sport. In
flush of pleased excitement Members
didn't wait to wonder how he could
have got the thing down to the House,
and where he had left it. At most it
could only be a sort of harmonium;
possibly with the vox humana. It is
no new thing for a Member to illustrate
his address by introducing samples.
BROADHURST himself did it in a speech
delivered some years ago. HOWARD
VINCENT, pursuing his crusade against
objects of domestic use made in Germany,
one night came down loaded with pans,
brushes, door-mats, an assortment of
cutlery, and a complete set of carpenter's
tools. LYON PLAYFAIR, delivering at the
Table a luminous address on margarine,
temporarily fitted it up on the model of
a chemist's shop.
A church organ is different, considera-
tions of bulk hampering its removal.
Yet large masses have been moved both
into the House and out of it. Once a
petition in favour of Missions to the
Pato.gonians (or against the enterprise,
I forget which) was rolled in with the
assistance of ten stalwart messengers,
whose united ages exceeded seven cen-
turies. Then wasn't Mr. FLAVIN carried
forth? Especially if scaled after dinner,
he would make any barrel organ in
London kick the beam. These reflec-
tions, flashing through the active mind
at a quicker rate than they may be
written down, encouraged hope in the
breasts of Members.
"Play! Play!" they cheerily cried,
whilst BROADHURST looked round be-
wildered, wondering what they were
laughing and cheering at.
Soon disappointment followed on
expectancy. "When I say a church
organ," BROADHURST explained, " I mean
an organ of the Church."
Very well, that's much the same
thing. Finally it turned out that what
he really did mean was a parish
magazine, published weekly under the
editorship of the Vicar. That quite a
different thing, and Members, glancing
angrily at the man who had wantonly
raised hope of diversion, turned again
to the intricacies of Clause 7.
Biiainesa done.—In Committee on
Education Bill.
Tuesday niglit.—Two curious ques-
tions on Paper to-day. WILLIAM (not
JOHN) BULL, Member for Hammersmith,
wants to know when restrictions on
import of Argentine beef will be
removed.
"What's BULL got to do with Argen-
tine beef?" I asked the MEMBER FOR
SARK.
"Can't tell you exactly," he said;
"but, you know, blood is thicker than
water."
The other question stands in name
of CHARLIE BERESFORD; is addressed
to PRINCE ARTHUR. Wants to know
"whether attention of Government has
been given to need for some reinforce-
ment of intellectual equipment for
directing the forces of the Empire ?''
Rather a nasty one this when you
come to think of it. BRODRICK and
SELBORNE, heads of the two Departments
aimed at, have come to think of it, and
resent suggestion question designed to
convey. What further could be done in
the way of intellectual equipment at the
War Office and the Admiralty than was
achieved when, two years ago, the
MARKISS, feeling necessity of strengthen-
ing his Government, appointed new
heads to these Departments?
PRINCE ARTHUR airily replies that he
"will be delighted, in any way, to
increase intellectual equipment in con-
nection with this or any other subject."
Sounds well, but 011 reflection per-
ceived to signify nothing. CAP'EN TOMMY
BOWLES, always on the spot, with ex-
tended mailed fist points out this short-
coming.
"The right hon. gentleman," he said,
"has not stated what steps he will take
in that direction."
"The field," PREMIER replied, with
courteous bow towards the ancient
mariner, " is open to such talent as may
be available."
House laughed; evidently a joke
here. Before the CAP'EN could think of
retort courteous, SPEAKER called on next
question.
On reflection, meaning of PREMIER evi-
dent. His reply was an invitation to
talent to step forward. Mr. COGWHEEL
—I mean Mr. COGHILL—with great
presence of mind seized opportunity.
Not been heard from lately. Now the
time to put liis patent apparatus into
action and stop the machinery of the
sitting. Introduction of the COGWHEEL
recalling PRINCE ARTHUR'S attention to
him, he would see where desired talent
lay, and straightway either the Admi-
ralty or the War Office would bo
'jndowed with that intellectual equipment
hankered after by CHARLIE B.
What to do on spur of moment? Here's
where native talent asserted itself; in-
tellectual equipment shone with radiant
light. Mr. COGWHEEL has heard from
private sources that the LORD CHIEF
JUSTICE of England and that other
revolutionary person, Mr. J ustice BIGHAM,

FINANCE.
Sir Edg-r Y-nc-nt ha* been mentioned us a pouible

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.

"Some reinforcement of Intellectual Equipment for directing the Forces of the Empire."
Some of the " available talent" to which Mr. B-lf-r so unkindly referred.
(Mr. C-gh-11, Cap'en Tommy B-wl->, and Lord Ch-rl-> B-r-af-rd.)
have got a little game in hand. Four
days in advance of Long Vacation they
mean to lay down their ermine and
their wig and secretly depart on a
premature holiday. Whether they are
going off to bathe together at Margate,
whether they will spend alternate happy
days at Hampstead and Greenwich, or
whether they are merely going on
State business to South Africa, Mr.
COGWHEEL doesn't know. The fact of
their contemplating surreptitious depar-
ture is unquestioned, and Mr. COG-
WHEEL, with one eye on the Admiralty,
the other on Pall Mall, crying aloud for
reinforcement of intellectual equipment,
asks leave to move the adjournment in
order to discuss as a matter of urgent
public importance conduct he described
as "a dereliction of statutory duty, a
grave public scandal."
The SPEAKER shut him up with direc-
tions that if he wants to indict the
Judges he must adopt other procedure.
The House disposed to regard this as
a snub. Mr. COGWHEEL chuckled as he
considered he had gained his object.
If Prince ARTHUR was looking out for
intellectual equipment with an eye to
business he would know where to find it.
Business done.—Another night with
Education Bill.
House of Lords, Friday night.—
Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY, strolling about
with dazed air, hasn't got over COUNTY
! GUY'S behaviour of Tuesday night. He
had called attention to the estimate for
expenditure with respect to the repair
j of three small farms in the diocese of
St. Asaph belonging to the benefice of
Trefor Traian, Denbighshire, now in
course of sequestration, and gave notice
of his intention to move for papers.
His topic presented and enlarged upon,
he was preparing to carry out the
intention of moving for papers when
there suddenly flashed upon him recollec-
tion of Mr. Wegg's bargain with Mr.
Boffin as related in Our Mutual Friend.
The wealthy but illiterate Boffin engages
Mr. Silas Wegg, "a literary man with
a wooden leg," to read to him. The
bargain is struck as far as prose is con-
cerned. Then comes the question of
poetry. "Would it come dearer?"
Mr. Boffin asked. '' Not being a regular
musical professional," Silas Wegg mag-
nanimously replied, "I should be loath
to engage myself for poetry; and there-
fore when I drop into poetry I should
ask to be considered in the light of a
friend."
Lord STANLEY OF ALDERLEY, looking
round the historic Chamber where he
has Bat for more than thirty years,
wherein he has made more inaudible
speeches than any other Peer, felt his
breast swell with friendship. He hadn't
a wooden leg; but why should Silas
Wegg, an obscure ballad monger, exceed
him in generosity? A sudden impulse
to drop into poetry possessed him. Of
course in so doing he should ask to be
considered in the light of a friend.
Unfortunately, in the hurry of the
moment, only two verses occurred to
him. One was from the Old Hundredth
Psalm; the other from "Casabianca."
Some doubt remains as to which was
selected. The noble Lord's lips were
observed to move, and a mumbling
noise echoed through the Chamber.
COUNTY GUY was positive he heard the
line—
The boy stood on the burning deck.
However that be, when Lord STANLEY,
by sitting down, intimated that he had
finished his remarks, COUNTY GUY, fol-
lowing in capacity of Leader of the
House, protested that he could make
neither head nor tail of tie noble Lord's
enquiry.
"I notice," he added, taking up the
Orders of the Day, "that the noble
Lord proposes to ask for papers. I
gathered from his concluding remarks
that he was reciting a piece of poetry."
The Peers tittered. STANLEY OF
ALDERLEY still lamenting this flippancy.
How different was Silas Wegg's recep-
tion by the large-minded Boffin when
he dropped into poetry!
Business done.—Estimates.
HORACE FOR GOLFERS.
"Persicos odi, puer, apparatus."
JONES, my boy, your barbarous innova-
tions
Ought to be prohibited (save for
ladies)—
Mischievous new-fangled abominations!

ceived in sorrow;

[JULY 30, 1902.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FEW DON'TS FOR HOT WEATHER;
OR, HOW TO KEEP COOL.
DON'T run after a stranger's hat when blown off, unless
it is a better one than your own.
Don't run up hills or bills.
Don't run down the War Office—it will run down] of
itself, if left to time.
Don't run to seed—in fact, don't run at all.
Similar violent exercise should be avoided; therefore
Don't strike a bad bargain or a faulty balance.
Don't push or drive an argument to a false conclusion.
Don't drag the word "strenuous" in everywhere—we
can't all be ROOSEVELTS.
Don't fump together in this temperature, not even if you
are a great wit.
Don't rush into print—except with good advice, as at
present.
Don't roll logs—let the other fellow do that.
Don't throw good money after bad.
Don't cast reflections on your wife's appearance.
Don't liurl abuse at the actors if you dislike the play.
Don't fall in love.
Don't break a promise or an engagement—that is the
young lady's privilege.
Don't burst into poetry—it always gets laughed at in
Court.
Don't heave sighs at your ladylove.
Don't ride a hobby to death.
Don't plunge into a reverie or a train of thought.
All these activities and displays of energy will induce an
increase of temperature, and are accordingly to be eschewed
now that the dog days are close at hand.
QUELQUES SHOWS A VOIR IN BOND STREET.
ANYONE who has been lucky enough to escape being
blinded by flying particles of wood-pavement by day, and
by blinking electric advertisements by night, may ensure a
quiet half-hour's enjoyment by dropping out of the bustling
tide of New Bond Street into the fascinating " back-water"
of the Wood bury Galleries. Here he may renew acquaintance
at first-hand with the drawings of G. R. HALKETT—no
stranger to Mr. Punch's readers—whose "Seats of the
Mighty," with their marvellously ingenious fret-saw work,
constitute a collection of furniture which must be the envy
of Tottenham Court Road, and surely entitles him to rank
as the SHERATON or CHIPPENDALE of caricature. His style is
vigorous and telling, and he has an artistic quality in his
work which some of his brother caricaturists, more simply
rollicking and oblivious to technique, no doubt envy him.
This is well seen here in some bold drawings on dark paper
relieved with "wash," which appeared in the Pall Mall
Magazine.
In the same Galleries Mr. HARRY FUBNISS has brought
together with characteristic energy and timeliness a happy
collection of his political drawings under the title of "The
Two Premiers." Coming at the moment when the mantle
of leadership passes from the burly figure of Lord SALISBURY
on to the slimmer shoulders of Mr. BALFOUR, and dealing
largely with these two men-of-the-hour, this little exhibition
may well hope to profit by their popularity. Perhaps the
most powerful drawing is one showing the Army bound
up in the tentacles of Red Tape. A sketch of Lord SALISBURY,
drawn on the day of his retirement, is excellent as a like-
ness, and there is an interesting prophetic picture, which
appeared in Mr. Punch's page) several years ago, of Mr.
UALFOUB, made up aa his uncle, and succeeding to the
Premiership. Some of the best of Mr. FORNISS'S drawings
in the Japanese manner are also included. As an additional
attraction the management has provided a "haunted room"
at the end; at any rate our emissary came out after a brief
visit, with his hair, such as remains of it, rigidly on end,
and a settled conviction that he had seen ghosts.
RECITATIONS A LA MODE.
THE concert? Oh, my dear, just heavenly!
I did enjoy myself. But where were you?
I thought you said—oh, well, I wish you had.
You don't know what you missed. Unless you 've heard
What happened? Oh, dear, no, not KUBELIK,

It wasn't him. That French girl. What's her name?
That's it. Yes! Well, you know, when she recites,
One never knows what's coming next,—at least,
Unluckily—quite so—one always does!
Of course you 've heard her? But, my dear, you must!
She 's simply killing! No, no! Never that!
Only Parisian. Such abandonment!
So dernier cri. But, yes! au bout des angles!
And yet one has a feeling all the time
It isn't quite—exactly !—comme il faut.
No doubt it's insular, but—yes, of course!
It isn't for oneself, it's—yes, one's girls!
That's what I mean. And dearest ANGELA
Was with me, all in white: the sweetest tiling
From PAQUIN'S. Just adorable she looked.
And, though she 's such a darling innocent,
She knows as much as I do. Yes, indeed!
It's really excellent—her French. In fact I knew
That if she heard her she would understand—
But every word! So what was I to do?
My dear! Go home? We couldn't possibly.
Oh, no! The thing was charmingly arranged.
We sent them all away—the girls, 1 mean—
Into another room, while Whatshername
Recited. WJio? The Bachelors? What do you mean!
They stayed, of course. Why, think, how different.—•
They 're more like us. You see, they understand!
You dear delightful Granny! Come with me—

No? Well, I must. Bye-bye! I 'n^in the vein.
"A GREAT SWIM BY HOLBEIN."—This heading in the
Daily Chronicle must have caused a stir among Art collectors.
"Why," writes an indignant correspondent, "Why is not
this picture in our National Gallery? Who, I ask, is re-
•onsible for such an oversight? I have walked through
.e galleries and noted every picture in the catalogue, but
not one entitled A Great Swim, by Holbein, can I find."
SPEAKING of the charms of Corea, the Daily Express says,
"There is no such thing as a novel or newspaper in the
land. No regular story-writer is known to have lived there
for 1000 years." Mr. "Punch would be glad to receive fair
warning of any other country where they live as long as
that.

HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS.
VII. — THE NOONDAY GARDENS.
IT is blazing hot — one o'clock on a
July afternoon. There are blisters on
the wooden doors by the turnstiles, and
the bored janitors admit us with an air
of hardened resignation. The Great
Wheel revolves relentlessly with empty
cars, forcing upon us mingled thoughts
of the poetry of motion and Somebody's
Malted Milk. A stall-girl by the bridge
mechanically comprises us both under
the cognomen of "WILLIE," inviting
attention to brooches. The band has
not yet started in the Gardens; the
chairs are almost empty, save for an
occasional newspaper-reader and some
sparse needle-workers. The sun
down upon a yellow Sahara of
tables with their dozing waiters. The
Welcome Club is a prairie of empty
chairs.
We pasa into Elysia. The first
shade we meet is a tired man whose
lot it is to stand upon the threshold
of the Liliputian Menagerie. From
within are heard the strains upon a
piano of a three-year-old coon song.
The Educated Birds, we are assured,
are pronounced by Press and Public to
be the best and most original attraction
in Elysia. 0 spirit of Virgil! The piano
ceases, and a melancholy audience of
three makes its way out into the sun.
"Commence again in a few minutes,"
announces the tired man; "secure your
seats, ladies and gentlemen."
A few people wander past him with
a stony stare.
"Finest baby wolf in Europe!" calls
the tired man wrathfully at their retreat-
ing backs; but they hurry on, intent
on the Epicurean joys of lunch at the
Automatic Buffet.
"Created a furoar in Paris," mutters
the tired man, with fatigued disgust.
A mournful giant in top boots issues
spasmodic invitations to a French
Musical Ride, pronounced by Press and
Public to be the most original attraction
in the Exhibition.
"All thoroughbred 'orses," he an-
nounces in the direction of distant
wanderers; he seems to have reached
the stage at which he neither hopes
nor cares any longer for success. Out-
side the Oriental concert room we en-
counter the first signs of vitality in the
person of a swarthy man in a red cap,
superior alike to the heat and to the
sinister proximity of the St. John's
Ambulance " in case of sudden illness."
The tone of his invitation seems to in-
dicate that he is quite ready to use
force, if necessary. After this it is a
relief to come to the Distorting Mirrors,
whose guardians merely deliver a me-
chanical persuasion and relapse again
into apathy.

•••
"I SAY, BILLY, 'KBE'S A GIPSY! LET'S 'AVE OUR FOETINS TKLLED I"
Further on a little group of warm
people lias collected round an energetic
Hindoo on a platform, who is making
a surprising noise in an unknown
tongue, aided by a small drum. The
Hindoo embarks upon a conjuring
trick with a cap and an egg, con-
tinuing in the meantime liis shrieks
and gibberings. The group watch the
course of the conjuring with a kind
of b/ase scepticism. Eventually he
banishes the egg from the cap and
produces it from a niche in the wall.
There is a lack of enthusiasm on the
part of the crowd; the Hindoo accord-
ingly supplies the applause himself.
Noticing defections he again applies
himself to his drum, at the same time
rousing a man in evening dress, asleep
at the foot of the platform, who, finding
the crowd made, ascends a chair and
delivers an encomium upon the attrac-
tions within. Once the ladies and
gentlemen see them they will be one
and all a walking and talking adver-
tisement. They are pronounced by
Press and Public to be the most original
attraction in the Exhibition.
The speech ends, and the ladies and
gentlemen, unambitious of these hopes,
begin to melt away.
"Not that way, ladies and gentle-
men," calls the orator, with a sad smile,
"but this. This is the way in."

Dolly. "YES, AUNTIE. BUT I DO WISH THIS BIO ONE HADN'T SUCH A FUNNY LAUGH!"
There is no response, and he
addresses himself to a little group of
lingering soldiers.
"Everyone in uniform is half-price
to-day," he tells them.
They look at each other sheepishly
and drift away. An elderly gentleman
remains, gazing dubiously at the en-
trance. The Hindoo joins the orator in
honeyed persuasion, and the solitary
gentleman, finding himself the cynosure
of attention, retreats in confusion.
"That," observes the orator to the
Hindoo, "is all right, isn't it?" And,
climbing down, goes to sleep again at
the foot of the platform.
We depart, from Elysia, the voice of
the tired menagerie-keeper still enquir-
ing if there are any more for the
Wonders of the Jungle.
It is very hot in the Imperial Court,
and the band is not yet playing. The
same sense of general dreariness pre-
vails. Even the bars are almost empty.
A mother has laid her sleeping infant
at length upon a crimson couch, and is
Siting an india-rubber comfort between
its lips. A grammaphone belches forth
a nasal love song into space. The
"reen Dragon is lumbering slowly
round the gardens with a sparse
freight. A few couples, their features
narked by a stoical resignation, are
being taken round the lake in small
.aunchcs. By a sudden inspiration we
lay sixpence to take a trip along the
:>tyx, and a cockney Charon pilots us
azily through Hades. It is the first
,ime we have felt cool.
And so we stroll back again into the
Western Gardens, conscious of a strange
discordance in everything. There is a
certain indecency about the place seen
by glaring sunlight; we receive the im-
pression of a gas jet flaring in the day.
Yet there is something vastly human in
the way this great pleasaunce takes its
mood with the hour of the day. Even
now, as we make our way out through
the Western Gardens, the place is be-
ginning slightly to awake from its mid-
day siesta. The stand begins to be
dotted with scarlet bandsmen. Already
we sight the vanguard of the gay com-
pany that will hold revel here in the
cool of the evening. Meanwhile, hot and
dusty, we drag our tired feet towards the
turnstiles. The mechanical voice of the
same stall-girl still invites passing
WILLIES to buy a brooch for their sweet-
hearts. We push the heavy turnstile
forward, and taking advantage one
behind the other of the narrow strip of
shade thrown by the wooden wall on to
the gravel path beyond, make our weary
way out into the street.
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
(Extracts from the Daily Illuminator.')
FROM all over the country come reports
of curious atmospheric phenomena which
have been noticed during the last few
days. At the time of the Martinique
disaster it will be remembered that we
advised our readers that the after effects
would probably be noticed in our island,
and the communications from corre-
spondents which we publish below
more than verify our prediction.
A remarkable sunset has just been
witnessed by a correspondent in Upper
Sloshington. He had been celebrating
his birthday with a few friends, and
as he was returning home he distinctly
saw two suns sinking slowly towards
the horizon. We regret that we cannot
furnish our readers with other details
of this unusual phenomenon, as, after
dispatching his communication to us,
our correspondent called the attention
of a policeman to the spectacle, who
immediately placed him in the lock-up
on the ridiculous assumption that he
was intoxicated. When will our
authorities learn to refrain from
placing every possible obstacle in the
way of scientific enthusiasts?
While on this subject our readers
will learn with interest that a sunset of
peculiar beauty was witnessed last
night at Long Tiddenham. An eye
witness states that towards eleven
o'clock in the evening what appeared
to be a tongue of fire darted across
the western sky. With extraordinary
rapidity the whole heaven seemed to
change from grey to orange and from
orange to crimson, relieved here and
there by clouds of a dark substance,
which we take to have been volcanic
dust. We had hoped that our corre-
spondent at Beorminster, which stands
on a slight eminence twenty miles due
west of Tiddenham, woidd have
supplied us with further details. Un-
fortunately, however, his attention was
entirely occupied by a terrible conflagra-
tion which broke out at about that
hour in a large oil-store. His account
of this disaster will be found on another
page.
BALLADE OF THE DILETTANTE.
AT Matinees and Picture Shows
I gaze about with languid air;
The newest " Art," the latest pose,
I greet alike with frigid stare.
Your modern trash I well could spare;
For me the status that is "ante,"
And quaintly mediaeval fare—
In short I am a dilettante.
I sport the choicest ties and hose;
My orchid is beyond compare;
My hat and boots alike disclose
^Esthetic taste and judgment rare.
On Eastern, gems or Sevres ware,
On MICHAEL ANQELO or DANTE,
To contradict me few will dare—
In short, I am a dilettante.
In politics my deadly foes
Are folks with elongated hair,
Who prate about the workman's woes,
And drag discussion everywhere;
Who want my surplus wealth to share
With cads who call a house a "shanty;"
At fools like these I only glare—
In short, I am a dilettante.

My liege, of triBes light as air
My knowledge is by no means scanty,
But honest work I cannot bear—
In short, I am a dilettante.

A PUNCH STAFF-COLLEGE.
[At University College School (Head Master. Mr. Lmwn PATON, formerly
Captain of Shrewsbury) a prize has been given for a series of cartoons
the Masters being the models. It was won by a son of Mr. A. S. BOYD
whose work is familiar to the readers of Punch,}
PATON, your hand! I never thought
That in our midst we had a School
Where adolescence might be taught
So charmingly to play the fool!
Not since, by far Trinacria's shore,
Great DIONYSIUS held the throne,
Has Art enjoyed such license, or
So suave a"" tyrant " set the tone.
Your hand, I say! and here 's my heart
(Warm with the afterglow of lunch)
That yearns to hymn your glorious part
As patron of a School for Punch.
In one dear scene our lots were cast,
Where Severn nursed her old renown,
And still the un forgotten past
Outwears the pedagogic gown.
Else how should you so well disarm
The schoolboy at his wanton game,
And take from sin its secret charm
By stamping it with virtue's name?
But here is genius! here a touch
Of what the gods alone bestow;
For, while Salopia taught you much,
She never taught you this,.I know.
Nay, if my memory plays me true,
The scheme to which your tastes are wed
Directly stultifies the view
Held by our venerated Head.
For, had our young Hellenic sense
On fancy-portraits been employed.
We should have earned a recompense
Other than that of Master BOYD.
Discovered, from his awful seat,
Limning the Chief in furtive wise,
Whatever promise marked the feat,
Ten "penals " would have been our prize!
Forgive me, if I call from sleep
Indecorous thoughts of days long done;
You have your dignity to keep,
While I have, obviously, none.
Yet though, in life's estranging maze,
At sterner tasks you toil and spin,
Our common love of laughter's ways
Leads me to hope you count me kin!
And if in "letters more humane"
You 've passed my little range of skill
I like to think your ampler brain
Approves an art humaner still.
Macte! and ever may the round
Of graver duties leave you free
So to support a training-ground
Of younger TENNIELS yet to be.

"YES," yawned BEN HUB, to whom ULYSSES, grown
curiously fat and Elizabethan withal, had been relating his
adventures with CALYPSO, "something of the kind happened
to me. A little Egyptian person, one IRAS—understand this
was before I was married"
"My wife was at home," chuckled ULYSSES, depressing
one eyelid slightly, "singing the songs of mine own land.
By my troth, but that my admirable dexterity of wit delivered
me, good master BEN——"
"I trust your wife was not young," interrupted the Count
MALATESTA, gloomily; "my FEANCESCA, alas"
"Sir," said Colonel BONHAM, of the Eleventh United States
Cavalry, "shake hands across the sea. I just expect we've
had trouble of that sort down in Arizona."
"Why in the name of FELIX PODBELLE shouldn't she have
been young?" exclaimed the Marquis of QUEX, jauntily;
"mine was—oh, it's you, GEORGE—GIOVANNI, I mean. I
beg your pardon. Poor devil! The middle ages were no
place for the middle—ahem! for those in the prime of life."
"Aha, milord! And how's MURIEL?" inquired SAPHO.
"That nice young man of hers returned from Hong Kong
yet?"
"You must be aware, my dear lady," replied his lordship,
"that it 's not the least use your paying your addresses to
me."
"My wife," began the gentle voice of Mr. MASK EMBUBY,
"was to have been young, but unfortunately the best laid
schemes of mice and men"
"So sweet of you to furnish a house for 'em !" laughed
SAPHO. "Helaa! why did I never meet a philanthropist!"
"I never met anyone," remarked a military gentleman,
severely, "until I met the Hon. Mrs. GEORGE D"'ALROY; and
all the time I was in India, fighting with the sword which,
you will remember, she bravely tried to buckle to my belt
at the end of Act II."
"Please don't!" they all cried; "no doubt you 're much

If EDWARD the Emperor came here to-day
Wid an escort of princes, I 'd get in his way!
Now EDWARD and me, we are very dear friends,
And when he's wid me, it's himself that unbends;
But bedad it's the truth, that I never will sing,
No matter who bids me to—" God save the KINO."

PUNCPI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DITTY OF CHAMPAGNE.
THIS is the fellow for strut and swagger:—
With his tilted sword and his rakish dagger,
And his breast as gay as a herald's tabard,
And his cloak caught up on the long sword's scabbard,
And the fine hose fashioned for summer weather,
And the cap aflame with its red cock's feather,
And the doublet slashed into purple gashes,
And a fluttering hint of his gold-edged sashes,
And the long red shoes with their pointed toes,
Out and .about and back he goes;
Swaggers, his hair all crisp and curled,
And the ends of his saucy moustaches twirled,
Free to the edge of the happy world.
And hark to the echoes rolling, rolling
To the song that the beggar's voice is trolling:—
"All good fellows of each degree,
Hurry and join my company!
Show me your souls and I '11 give them winga,
Crown them, sceptre them, make them Kings.
Roistering, flashing, and all zig-zagging,
Off we go with our tongues a-wagging;
And each of our band, when he meets another,
Salutes him straight as his heart's own brother.
Take but a look, and, your minds on fire,
Each of you owns his dear desire;
Laughs for it, hugs it, always sought it,
But never found it and never bought it,
Until, with a smile that pierced right thro'ugh him,
And a wave of my hand, I gave it to him."
Then swift he summons to meet your need
A curvetting flame-eyed chestnut steed;
And before you have time to think or stammer,
The world flies by that his hoof-beats hammer,
And you on his back, with your knees set tight,
And your being a blaze of golden light,
Off and away with the steed's mad flight,
Reckless of all that the rush may bring,
Off you clatter and on you swing.
Back rolls memory's curtain, back,
And it's gold, pure gold, that was once mere black.
Golden visions of golden hours
Spent in a garden of rich red flowers,
Where warm to your throbbing breast you fold
A wonderful girl with a heart of gold.
This is the fellow for me, and I, Sir,
I wouldn't change him for King or Kaiser.
Wherever his swaggering steps go free
He may count me one of his company. "Tis."
MORE NATURE STUDY.
WE are moved by the present Exhibition at Regent's
Park to suggest the following Objects, among others, for
Study and Investigation during the coming holidays :—
1. TlieNoteof the Curfew. Budding ornithologists, fresh
from town, should be on the qui vive in remote country
districts where this curious and plaintive metallic monotone
may still be heard on quiet evenings. It must not be con-
founded with the Boom of the Bittern, the Lay of the Nest-
egg, the Drone of the Battle-Dor, the Hum of the Hum-Bug,
and like vespertinal sounds.
2. The Different Kinds of Hopper. Much instruction
may be derived from a comparison of the Grass, Sand,
Cheese, Dancing, and Whitechapel varieties. The last, of
which many sub-families are present in Kent and Sussex
during the last weeks of summer, should be studied from a
distance, as they are generally unsafe to handle, and resent
examination.
3. The Length of a Rustic "Mile." Its precise value has
never yet been satisfactorily ascertained, and undying fame
awaits the Nature-student who can reduce it exactly to
commensurate terms. The common carrier, the wayside
stone-breaker, the local fly-man, the bond fide traveller
(on Sundays), and many others, all give widely discordant
estimates.
4. TJie Parish Pump. There is an opportunity here for
inquirers to arrive at the true inwardness of the wealth of
political allusion and literary tradition with which this
familiar object has been invested. It may turn out, after
all, to rest upon an unsound and rotten basis, like the Village
Pound, the Stocks, and other moss-grown institutions.
5. The Rural Milkmaid. Considerable doubts have lately
been expressed, in spite t>f the poets, as to the continued
existence of any specimens of this genus in England, and it
is a point, therefore, which Nature students might take upon
themselves to clear up. Light might incidentally be thrown
upon the smock frock and the agricultural labourer
both now believed to be extinct.
OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
SIR GEORGE R. SITWELL, Bart., F.S.A., in one among many
interesting papers by various authors contained in The
Ancestor, a Quarterly Review of County and Family History,
Heraldry, and Antiquities, No. 1 (ARCHIBALD CONSTABLE & Co"),
tells us how "The first gentleman to whom a monument
was erected was JOHN DAUNDELYON, of Margate, who died
about 1445." Margate has something of which to be proud:
and those who know Thanet will remember that the name
of DANDELION, so spelt now-a-days, is that of a considerable
farming property in the island. This is a small matter, but
it happened to catch the eve of the Baron, to whom anything
relating to this annexe of Kent is particularly interesting.
To commence the volume is an article written by the Earl
of MALMESBURY, that ought to be of the utmost interest to
everyone acquainted with Mrs. Qamp and Betsy Prig (in
CHARLES DICKENS'S Martin Chuzzlewit), entitled "Some
Anecdotes of the Harris Family." Do we not all remember
(are not the words deeply graven on the tablets of our
memory ?) how Betsy Prig impugned Sairey Gamp's veracity,
when Betsy, "shutting her eye still closer, and folding her
arms still tighter, uttered these memorable and tremendous
words: 'I don't believe there's no sich a person !'''
This article in The Ancestor is the vindication of Sairey
Qamp, and puts utterly to the rout the "Bragian " audacity
of the superciliously incredulous Betsy. This most interest-
ing paper is aptly illustrated with photographs, not always
of the clearest, from portraits by Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS, S'ir
THOMAS LAWRENCE, and others; while in disproof of the
impudent Prigian assertion, there stands out ihevera effigies
of Mrs. HARRIS herself (" Mrs. JAMES HARRIS " she was, to be
strictly accurate, "wife of JAMES HARRIS, M.P.") after the
painting by JOSEPH HIQHMORE. A propos of illustrations,
there is one excellently printed in colours "of the deepest
dye," representing "Roundel of Stained Glass, with Arms
of Lyte and Horsey." To the superficial but ready-witted
reader (who might be inclined to ask "Who was Roun-
del ? ") it may be necessary to explain that this illustration
of " Arms " does not represent them as those of some jockey
celebrated in his day as being the very model of a boy
"Lyte and Horsey," but is one of several representations of
"Heraldic Glass from Lytes Gary," pictorially instructing the
readers of an article on this subject, by Sir H. MAXWELL-LYTE,
K.C.B. Ancient lights could have no better exponent of their
history than this modern shining LYTE. Well is it that The
Ancestor is a quarterly; this number, issued in April, has
lasted the Baron till August, and even now he has read but
a third of its peculiarly interesting contents. The Baron

He has been informed that the second
Ancestor is already " out." The autho-

HARD LUCK.
HARD luck! to lose the toss at first,
And, after they had done their worst,
Hard luck, once more, to have to bat
Upon a pitch as bad as that.
And then, to spoil our chance again,
Hard luck, indeed, that it should rain.
Hard lack, the catches that we dropped;
Hard luck, the boundary hits they
stopped.
And luck as hard as well could be
That we should lose at last by three;
While—liardest luck of all—the test
Proved the Australian team the best.

abominable and several other adjectives

NOT IMMORTAL.
[The latest utterance from Mr. HOCXFELLTR'S Univpraity of Chicago is
found in a lecture on art and literature by WILLIAM NOHMAJT GUTHRIB.
He declared: "SHAKSPKAHE and HOMEB are not immortals, and I should
be bitterly disappointed if they were. I hope that in the near future the
human race will so improve in itt tastee and accomplishment* that SH AKSPEABE
will be held unnt to read. I hope the literary world will advance »o rapidly
that SHAK-IT.AIU: and HOMES will not only have no reason for being
immortal, but will be even forgotten in their insignificance as compared with
future wiitera."]
SHAKSPEARE and HOMEB are doomed to obscurity—
GUTHRIE foretells it, and GUTHHIE should know!
He 's of Chicago, that fountain of purity,
So, if he speaks, we may know of a surety
None can gainsay it; it's bound to be so.
Upward and onward with cool intrepidity
Climbs the American—first among men;
Up, while he mocks at his rivals' timidity—
Up, imperturbable in his placidity—
Up, till he passes clean out of our ken!
Then he looks down, and our mental obliquity
Moves to compassion his sensitive heart:
Pigmies, we worship the gods of antiquity,
He from his pedestal sees as iniquity
All that is ancient in letters or art.
Much that to groundlings is incomprehensible
Plainly is read by the lords of the skies;'
We, though in darkness, are fitfully sensible
Weakness is wickedness, sloth indefensible—
Would we see visions we know we must rise.
Yes, we must strengthen our mental capacity,
Widen our landscape, and sharpen our sight;
Then we shall see what at first seemed audacity
Plainly revealed as the cultured sagacity
Born of a wedding of wisdom and light.
Then all the world will of course be unanimous,
Things will be weighed on a uniform scale;
None will be petty and none pusillanimous,
All will consider, aana bias and animus,
SHAKSPEARE a minnow, and GuiHRtE a whale.
Then, in the lowest and meanest society,
Thanks to Chicago's intelligent men,
There will be eagles in charming variety,
HOMER, in spite of his past notoriety,
Seeming by contrast no more than a wren.
Stratford will weep, and the GALLUP cryptology—
Liliput's strife—be an object of scorn;
Greece will deplore her denuded mythology,
HOMEE from Hades will send an apology,
Sorrowing most that he ever was born.
THE RECRUIT'S PROGRESS.
I.
THE first person to whom I broke the news, early in May,
of my resolve to serve my country as a Volunteer was my wife.
As a rule men who suffer from an abnormal craving for female
adulation—the self-conscious roosters of the human poultry-
yard—are my pet abomination. But the present occasion was,
of course, exceptional. At the cost of much inconvenience
and discomfort, to say nothing of danger, or, as I now know,
of ridicule, I was about to qualify myself for the efficient
discharge of one of the noblest duties of primitive man-—the
protection of the weaker sex. The fact that my wife is an
exaggerated specimen of the early Edwardian young woman,
ig loose limbs and a brainless passion for unintellec-
wi
tual sports, whereas I, both physically and mentally, am the
very opposite, only served to accentuate the extent of my
chivalrous devotion. Clearly this was a case in which I
trad a right to expect, if not admiration, at least grateful
sympathy. But my wife, I regret to say, did not rise to the
occasion. She failed to express more than the most languid
interest in my announcement.
"Really," she said, "that's very energetic of you." Then
she relapsed into silence.
After a short pause, during which I endeavoured to put
my wounded pride in my pocket, I returned to the charge.
"You don't seem," I remarked gently, "to understand
what it is that I propose to do?"
"Oh, but I do," she answered. "I understand perfectly.
But you said you had made up your mind. If you had
asked me first, I should have said that it was ridiculous ofyou
at your time of life. Won't you look rather silly? They
always make the uniforms so extremely tight."
I confess that this nettled me a little. It is discouraging
to have your figure and your years thrown in your face,
and by your wife of all people, when from a simple feeling
of duty you have made up your mind to a disagreeable
course of action—one that in my case ranks about midway
between going to the dentist and going to the Academy. I
explained this to RUTH in somewhat terse language. Also I
pointed out how the country, and, indirectly, she herself,would
benefit by my resolve. "Oh, ah, the French," she said.
"Well, and if they do land, you don't suppose you are going
to make any difference! Why, you can't see a haystack, much
less hit it. Besides, you know we are overdrawn as it is.
And I suppose it will cost you pounds and pounds."
"Shillings," I replied. "Thirty-one and a-half. And I
wouldn't hit a haystack if I did see it. Why should I?
And, as I am going out, I may as well tell you that you appear
to have been going about all day with a large smut on the
end of your nose."
On the stairs I met my wife's sister. I don't know what
it is in DAISY, but she always seems to understand me much
better than RUTH does. So I told her about my volunteer-
ing. I daresay that I was a trifle tragic, but I think, under
the circumstances, that was excusable. She put her hand
to her side.
"JOSEPH!" she cried; "you 're not!"
I nodded slowly.
"But what will RUTH say? Have you told her yet?"
"RUTH!" I repeated bitterly. "Yes, I 've told her. No,
she doesn't like it much. Not at all, in fact. But my mind
is made up."
"Oh, but JOSEPH! dear JOSEPH!" (Here she threw her
arms round my neck.) "Darling Jo!" (Here she kissed
me.) "Why? Why? There isn't anything—you haven't
been quarrelling with RUTH, have you?" (Here I looked
pained.) "Oh, but you mustn't. I can't let you." (Here I
began to feel distinctly better. This was much more the kind
of thing. And how different from RUTH!) "Oh, Jo, for
my sake, promise me you won't. Of course I know it 's
awfully dear and noble of you, and it makes me awfully
proud of you, but don't you think you—aren't you a little
old, and—and lame and stout and—er—-short-sighted?
And isn't it nearly over now?"
"One at a time," I said cheerfully. "As for my age,
I 'm not quite in my dotage yet. And I can still see with
glasses, and walk without crutches. And isn't what nearly
over?"
"Why, this horrid, horrid war. Taking all our best and
bravest. Oh, Jo, darling, say you won't go—-for my sake!"
"Go where?" I asked.
"Why, to Africa, of course. I know it's very selfish of
me, and I ought to send you out on your shield like the
what's-his-name matrons, but"

A TERRIBLE DOUBT.
DEAR PUNCH,—Out here in Teneriffe we are still curious
about the Peace Terms. We have read the account given in
the London papers, but against this we have to set the
authority of our local Spanish paper, La Opinion, which is
served by a telegraphic agency with information direct from
Madrid. This is what it says :—
"8e contirma la paz entre ingleiei y boen.
"Las principals condiciones de die ha paz, Begun telegramu que le reciben,

inglesaa, que eracuar&n inmediatamente dicho territorio.
"I.us boere coiuervaran la lengua holandeia, que sera la oficUl."
What are we to believe? You see, the Spaniards can
have no reason for concealing the truth, whereas the
Engh'sh papers might have motives.

"Loox'here," said the British Lion
irritably, as Mr. Punch's Representative
approached his den, "you're too late.
I don't care whether you want me for
a poem or c.n article, but 1 'm simply
full up with work. Go away and see
the Unicorn!"
Our Representative hastened to ex-
plain that he did not propose to ask
for the Lion's services at the present
time, since, doubtless, he was fairly
busy.
"'Busy?" returned the Royal Beast,
"that's no word for it! I'm simply
worn out! Think of what I 've done
in the last month or so. In answer to
requests from minor poets I've bran-
dished my mane two thousand and
fourteen consecutive times. No sooner
have I settled down for a nap than
some wretched versifier bids me awake
and guard my priceless heritage, or
something equally silly."
"Yes, but what would our writers do
if you refused to appear in their
Coronation Odes?"
"Oh," said the Lion, "anything in
reason, of course, I 'm willing to under-
take—but when it comes to wearing a
crown and brandishing my mane at the
same time, it's enough to try the
temper of any beast. Nowadays, too,
they interfere with my domestic life.
Until lately they never meddled with
this, but now they are always telling
me to 'summon my cubs'—I 've had to
do that in twenty leading-articles during
the summer, and my family don't like
it—they don't indeed. Then I promised
a poetess just before you came to grasp
the sceptre in my massive paw, and
really I 've not the least idea how it's
to be done. Ten to one she '11 want me
to roar directly afterwards—' paw '—
'roar '—that's her notion of rhyme.
But I won't roar. It hurts my throat
horribly."
"Couldn't you engage an assistant?"
asked our Representative.
"Oh, there is the Unicorn, but the
lazy beast hardly helps in a sonnet,
even, all the year round. People talk
about the Lion's share of the work, and
well they may! I believe, however, that
the Dove has had a fairly busy time of
it in peace poems, though, of course.
I've had to appear in them as well.
But I mean to go on strike soon, and
then—"
At this point a keeper appeared and
coughed significantly.
"Well," said the Lion sharply,
what is it? If it's another poet, tell
him to go and—"
"Very sorry to trouble you, Sir,"
said the keeper, "but a gentleman of
the name of AUSTIN is waiting to see
you on business. Says it's official and
most important."
Our Representative caught sight of
the Lion's expression on hearing these
words, and fled.

was said by "an Aberdeen correspon-
dent that it had been definitely decided
that the KING will visit Deeside after
the Coronation." This play on words,
it is not unlikely, we have hfard or

is happily applied. Many a true word

that this forecast is correct.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 28.
—There are pained moments in the life
of a Prime Minister when sense of public
duty compels him to perform what at
the moment seems an act almost of
or his attack on the Judges.
What of that? Only a fresh line in
advertisement.
After " with much respect " shouting
disorderly speech for half an hour,
throwing his arms about like an
inebriated windmill, MACNEILL sat
down full of content. BUODBICK made

"LONG LOST BROTHERS";
Or, one touch of sticking-plaster makes us wondrous kind.
inhumanity. Such ordeal PRINCE ARTHUR
went through to-night.
After Questions at afternoon sitting
SWIFT MACNEILL obtained leave to move
the adjournment in order to discuss as
matter of urgent public importance the
appointment of Commission on martial
law in South Africa, which last week
Mr. COGWHEEL, from another point of
view, denounced as a public scandal.
Sitting set apart for Committee on
Education Bill. Case so urgent that
Twelve o'clock Rule suspended. Mem-
"bers prepared to sit up through the
summer night wrestling over Clause 7.
Under old Rules the scatter-brained
Member for South Donegal would have
been master of the situation. Education
Bill would needs have been put aside;
precious time occupied, whilst his
inordinate vanity was gratified by
delivery of a speech sure to gain pro-
minence in newspaper reports by reason
of constant intervention of SPEAKER on
points of order.
Happily the New Rules stepped in.
By their beneficent operation afternoon
sitting rescued, SWIFT MACNEILL'S self-
advertisement relegated to the dull hour
that follows resumption of sittings
at nine o'clock. Made the most of
his opportunity; succeeded several
times in dragging up the SPEAKER.
Newspapers always report SPEAKER
verbatim in first person; so it 'a all
right for the show in to-morrow's papers.
True, the House nearly empty and
altogether impatient. Also C.-B. for-
mally washed his hands of the business;
would have nothing to do with SWIFT
brief reply; C.-B. washed his hands
as aforesaid; and up gat JOHN DILLON.
It was a few minutes to ten o'clock.
DILLON good for at least an hour; more
probably would make it hour and a
half. REDMOND cadet might foUow, and
a new day would dawn before House
allowed to take up Education Bill.
PRINCE ARTHUR moved the closure.
JOHN DILLON stood aghast. Never
was man's inhumanity to man more
brutally displayed. Through the dinner
hour been looking forward to this oppor-
tunity. The joy of wild asses in the
clover field nothing compared with
taking the House of Commons by one
ear, holding it whilst you pour into the
other illimitable flow of verbiage. Here,
at the very moment when the tap was
about to be turned on, PRINCE ARTHUR
plugged it.
SWIFT MACNEILL chuckled. Very sorry
of course: but at least he had enjoyed his
fling. Nothing could mar the pleasure of
that reflection. DILLON turning sharply
upon him, he adroitly ran the chuckle
into a roar of "Gag! gag!" Closure
carried, and business reached. But
not till after two divisions and the
waste of an hour and twenty minutes,
a loss the House querulously toiled
after, making it up in the watches of
the night whilst others slept.
Business done. — Very little before
midnight.
Tuesday night.—DON Jos 6 back again,
bringing his scars with him. C.-B.
welcomed his return in one of those
genuinely warm-hearted speeches that
are in tune with the best traditions of
the House of Commons. As DON Jcsi
truly said, C.-B. never allows political
controversy to degenerate into per-
sonal animosity; a lesson it would be
well if some would learn in their
attitude towards C.-B.
In his face, pallid and a little pinched,
DON JOSE showed some sign of his
accident. His speech, an hour long,
disclosed no declension of vigour. True,
it was pitched on a gentler note than
rang through the House when the
Colonial Secretary, with back to the
wall, fought for his policy and for
colleagues faithfully carrying it out in
South Africa.
"A little blood-letting has done him
good," said CHARLIE BERESFORD, eyeing
him with keen scrutiny of professional
fighter.
Result proved afresh how Peace hath
her victories no less renowned than
War. Having won an arduous fight,
his sword sheathed, his helmet now a
hive for bees, DON JOSE breathed peace,
exhaled conciliation. Characteristic of
him that, midway in speech thus con-
structed, he pulled himself up for a
word in the ear of whom it might
concern.
"Our object," he said, "is to set up
in South Africa that system of self-
government in which we British have
so much confidence. But we are not
going to be hustled."
As a rule, DON Josfc's appearance at
the Table is signal for unrest on benches
opposite. The Irish incontinently go
for him; the Radicals murmur resent-

ment; old colleagues on Front Bench,
opposite interpose contradiction. To-
day, speaking on subject that has riven
political parties, broken up family
circles, estranged old friends, DON JOSE
pleased everybody. Ministerialists were
assured by his unflinching front in
insisting on full exactment of terms
of surrender. Liberal Imperialists
found in the speech final discomfiture
for their Pro-Boer brethren. Pro-Boers
discovered in certain passages back-
handed blows at Imperial PERKS.
Thus were Box and Cox both satisfied.
The House, as a whole, recognised
true statesmanship in the terms of
reference to the gallant foeman, and in
the painstaking plans matured, already
being carried out, for his resettlement
in his old home, with even something
more of the benefits of free citizenship
than were enjoyed under the corrupt
oligarchy of Pretoria.

COUNTY GUY beginning to discover that
Leadership of House is not all beer and
skittles. Here 's that skittish Peer.
NEWTON, in open revolt because when
he put a question with respect to that
Imperial measure, Local Government
Provisional Orders (No. 7) Bill, there
was no Minister present to reply. Busi-
ness pertained to KENYON, fourth Baron,
who in his person combines offices of
Lord-in-Waiting to the KING and repre-
sentative of Local Government Board in
the Lords. KENYON not being in his
place, NEWTON insisted that the Leader
of House was the proper person from
whom information might be sought.
Delightful to see cloud of apprehen-
sion that fell on expressive countenance
of COUNTY GUY. "Come now, you
know; bad enough to expect President
of Council to understand (in the main)
what the Cockerton Bill is about. If
he is also expected to explain Provisional
Orders Bill it will be time to go." All
COUNTY GUY could think of at the
moment was to promise that, dead or
alive, KENYON should be in his place at
next sitting.
Promise fulfilled.

that. Looking Lord KENYON'S thirty-
eight years full in the face, NEWTON with
grave irony expressed his "sympathy
with tiie noble lord suffering from a
malady which did not usually attack
one so young."
That was all right. Having set these
two young cocks a-fighting, COUNTY GUY
relapsed into his favourite attitude of
immobile observation. Still he hoped
KENYON wouldn't go having the gout
again when Provisional Orders Bills
were to the fore.

Lord Mayor. Then you mean to tell

the matter in that light; but we hope
to raise a slight temporary loan upon

ligh tea for the Banquet

Secretary. I am happy to say that
here will be no disappointment in that
direction; indeed, a contract with an
eminent firm of advertising agents
awaits your Lordship's signature. The

emblematic of the history of various

Lord Mayor. Ah! I see.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LANGUAGE PARAMOUNT.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. Henry
Harland.)
CHAPTER HI.
IT was half-past four on the morning
of April 27. The rising sun was ruling
the country-side with rays of red—like
ledger-lines, and the damp earth sent
up a thick pink vapour. Above, the
air full of birds, like an aspic of quails,
shook and trembled with their song.
The tern, the willywicket, the wood-
pecker, the hornfinch, the bean-crake,
mingled their strenuous paeans with the
sad gasp of the mute swan. ANTHONY
had had a bad night. He groped his
way along the dark corridors, past
ADRIAN'S door—outside of which lay in
disorder that eccentric genius's loose
white suit with the Toby collar and his
sugar-loaf felt hat—down the old oak
staircase, on to the kitchen. It was St.
Zita's day, and the servants had
decorated the cueina over-night with
calceolaria, fuchsias, love-in-the-mist,
pelargoniums, and various kinds of
peonies: Mme. Tournier, rosy flesh and
soft sulphur; Mme. Furtado, tinted
salmon-rose; and Lord Salisbury, rich
crimson—all quite distinct free-flowering
varieties.
"If yesterday hadn't been Friday,"
*JirHONY murmured to himself, " I might
have been able to hold out till break-
fast!" And he steered for the red
jarthenware bread-basket.
"WATTEAU—she bumps!"
It was the voice of SUSANNA. She was
seated aloft, on the top of the dresser.
Dver her night-robe she had thrown a
light fawn-coloured wrap—or was it a
waterproof ?—which she had tied round
it the waist with a sash of the Papal
colours. The deep ophicleide notes of
lier voice quivered through ANTHONY
like so many augers.
"Her voice is like a muffled dinner-
bell," mused ANTHONY, "or the siren, of
pour i ship when it's coming home."
A li mi I he said, "How do people jpro-
pose? In real life I mean; that is to
say, in novels, because life outside
aovels isn't really real, is it?"
"It depends on the people, or on one
}f them, said SUSANNA. And she looked
lown upon him, pityingly, deferentially,
wonderingly, yet with a mischievous
glow at the back of her eyes.
"Her eyes are like two fire-flies in a
butterfly-net!" thought ANTHONY. "I
Dnly know one of them," he said, "the
male one, and I 've prejudices with
regard to him. If you were half a chap,
you 'd tell me who the other one is—I
mean the girl, or the angel, or the little
jherub, or whatever she is." And he
looked up aloft.
"Please, I 'm the new lodger," crooned
SUSANNA. And the crimson colour welled
up into her face as she dropped her
eyes on to her little white toes, which
were looking up at her like ten tiny
silkworms. "I'm the second-floor
back," she added. And she laughed—
in the sleeve of her Aquascutum. "Her
laugh," thought ANTHONY, "is like
the sound of Best Silkstone coals pouring
into a marble cellar!" Then after a
pause, he asked her, "Why are you
sitting up there?"
"Look!" she said. And she pointed
to the floor. "I don't know how you
call them—il searafaggio!"
ANTHONY looked. A huge cockroach
was hurrying along the whitened pave-
ment, his little red legs straining on
either side of the polished pent-house
of his tortoise-shell wings, like the oars
of a Roman galley. His antennae were
alternately curved backwards or pointing
forward towards a certain deal box
ahead of him, shaped like an apexless
pyramid.
"Don't tread on him!" cried SUSANNA.
'' I wasn't going to," replied ANTHONY.
"He 's heading straight for the trap."
CHAPTER IV.
And later the summer came. SUSANNA
and ANTHONY were seated on the family
tomb of the VALDESCHI in Sanpaolo's
Churchyard. She had been telling him
the history of the family from the
earliest times—the plot, really, which
nobody needed, had she but known.
The sky was blue, the corn yellow, the
poppies red, and a brown brook babbled
and guggled close to them. The sun
was hovering over the horizon—ready
to rise or set at the whim of the novelist.
*es and locusts and cockchafers were
boring passages through the teeming
atmosphere, which was heavy with the
scent of sage, cipolla, mint, thyme,
tarragon and wild garlic.
"Then came the terrible persecutions
in 1813—when URBAN THE SIXTH, through
the machinations of SAVONAROLA, was
kidnapped and carried off to Avignon
by the mercenaries of GARIBALDI "—
SUSANNA went on. ANTHONY lay by her
side, his eyes closed, his chest rising
and falling—rhythmically—to the music
of her voice. "Gumo's step-mother
having married his late mother's first
husband, his younger brother became
as it were heir presumptive. Oh, it
is pitiful!" SUSANNA rose as she
tiled these last words, her tiny fist
clenched until the almond nails became
outlined—dimly—through the opales-
cent oyster-white backs of her hands.
Her eyes rose simultaneously, skywards,
like war-balloons (but Raillery sat in
the car!) Then her face closed—sud-
denly, blackly—like a Gibus when the
glass of a Hansom cab has accidentally
fallen upon it, and she gave a low moan.
"Was that dinner—or only the
dressing-gong? " asked ANTHONY, start-
ing into a sitting position.
"You were asleep!" cried SUSANNA,
flashing a whimsical little smile into
his left eye (which he presently re-
moved—surreptitiously—with the corner
of his pocket-handkerchief).
"I was never really awake—until I
met you," replied ANTHONY, evading her
imputation. "It's rather rummy, when
you come to think it over "he went
on—she listening with eagerness, but
her mischievous little mouth twitched
nervously now and then, like that of a
circus horse with an uncomfortable bit.
"Baby Man is lulled to sleep by the
nurse-maid—and Middle-aged Man is
called in the morning by the schiavetina
who brings him his copa di te, and his
bagno caldo! Woman's work is never
done ! I wonder how far we 've got into
our story?" he suddenly broke off.
"You've no idea, I suppose, how many
words I 've said to you ?''
"Why?" asked SUSANNA. And the
rosy rays of the rising sun—or the
crimson beams of the tramontare del
sole—whichever they chanced to be—
bronzed the bloom on her puce-coloured
hair.
"Because there 's something I 've got
to tell you—when I 've said a great many
more words to lead up to it," ANTHONY
explained. As he spoke he threw half
a brick into the brown brooklet, which
sent the newts and the stickleback
scudding in a thousand directions.
"Have you ever talked to any other
woman like this?" inquired SUSANNA.
And her voice sounded this time from
somewhere down—but right down—in
the very underground depths of her
heart, as though HOFFMANN were playing
a nocturne to the gas-meter. For a
moment ANTHONY paused and watched
the fish. His mind carried him back
to an open glade leading up to a castle
with fir trees, and an English Princessa
and cataracts, and himself on the wrong
side of them. But at this moment over
the brow of the hill appeared ADRIAN,
ambling along in a loosely-fitting livery
of the VALDESCHI, and with him, bearing
his snuff-box and the marriage licence,
moved the CARDINAL, wearing his rochet,
alb, amice, chasuble, dalmatic, and cope,
all at once.
"I knew it," cried ADRIAN on a key
of reminiscence; "I have talked to just
such another woman just like this.
You see, there's only one really nice
story in the world, and it's Anglo-Italian,
and it's been told already once, but
it is as gay and as dainty and as
diverting as ever."
"Life is nothing but vain repetition,"
said SUSANNA. "Parole! Parole!"
"In scecida saecuiorwm!" observed
the CARDINAL.

I WAS born in the old Kentish town
of Auchterlochty fifty-one years ago. The
bouse still stands midway between the
kirk and the bookshop, and there is
talk of turning it into a Nicoll or Dime
Museum, to be opened with suitable
addresses by my spherical friend Mr.
SHORTER, and my gifted colleague Signer
I-AGO MAGGIORE, alias Major POND.

The earliest thing I recollect is
being held at a window in Thrums to
see Mr. A. P. WATT go by. He was
dressed simply in a long tartan frock,
with accordion-pleated sleeves ; his right
hand held a rattle, his left a roll of
paper. He could hardly have been
pinker. He caught my eye as he
passed, in his nurse's arms, and we
have been friends ever since.

FORCE OF EXAMPLE.
Bobby. "MA, HARK PA CARHY ME TOO
I am told that I was a precocious
child. I soon mastered the Shorter
Catechism and preached sermons from
a hassock in the nursery, and every
Sunday afternoon I composed a piece
of verse. Instead of reading the foolish
books that are usually given to children
I spent hours over the Spectator and
Quarterly Review. Not that I gave all
my time to reading; on the contrary,
I was devoted to bird's-nesting, and am
still a profound o-ologist.

At school there was nothing about
my school-fellows that I did not know,
with the result that I was known as
the boy who Kent. Later I modified
this old nickname into the man of Kent,
but the signification remains the same.
My proficiency in journalism has not
come easily. It had to be toiled for.
At first I could write only one review
of a book, but gradually 1 learned to
write two, three, four, five, and even
six; and this, too, without duplicating
a sentence. Ah, me! Why is there no
Victoria Cross for the heroisms of peace?
I shall never forget the night when I
finished my first sixth-review. "Hence-
forward," I exclaimed, "my path is
Clear."

OPERATIC NOTES.
"Finals."—Opera tor this season is over. "After the
Opera 's over," as the old song had it, then come the reflec-
tions. Good season? Bad season? Well, all things con-
sidered, including Coronational disappointments, a very fair
season. At least it has produced one thing absolutely
unique, and that is Der Wold, the work of an English
composeress rejoicing in the British name of SHYTHE, which
after all is only SMITH "writ large." We have welcomed—
"Place aux dames"—Miss MAEY GARDEN and Frau LOHSE.
The work of composer BUNNING—"he's English too "—we
have noticed, and can say " Glad to hear from you again, Sir—
only, go one or two better." Madame MELBA is the bright par-
ticular star that brighter and brighter shines, season after
season, while CALVE, just a wee bit uncertain in her singing,
is, histrionically at all events, a joy for ever.
What more remains to be written, except-that Messrs.
RENDLE and FORSYTE, with Mr. NEILSON, the stage manager,
have temporarily joined the "Moody-Manners" Company
(would for the sake of lightness, brightness and politeness
in "Company manners" it would change its style and
title!), and are giving a season of operas at popular prices,
to which, as a trial trip with an idea of permanency, we
wish every success.
With a promising (and performing) company, these
managers propose giving several most popular operas (in
English); also an opera, as yet untitled, by PIZZI. If the
subject of the opera be classical and can be called Cato,
then the name of composer and opera would suggest the
lightest possible touch in combination as Pizei-Cato. So
ends the Opera Season, and so begins another. '' One down
t'other come on."
HISTORY (PICKWICKIAN) REPEATS ITSELF.
LAST week the St. Petersburg correspondent of the Times
gave a short account of the visit of "the distinguished
Japanese statesman, Count MATSUGATA," to the Russian
capital. "The Count," he wrote, "proposes to spend a
week or ten days in Russia, and will devote the time to
acquiring as much information as possible both from official
and from other sources with regard to the foreign policy
and the internal condition of the Empire." Does not this
remind us of Mr. Pickwick's interview with Count Smorltork
at Mrs. Leo Hunter's garden party?
"Have you been long in England?" inquired Mr. PICKWICK of the
illustrious foreigner.
1 Long—ver long time—fortnight—more."
'Do you stay here long ?"—" One week."
'You will have enough to do," said Mr. PICKWICK, smiling, "to gather
all the materials you want in that time."
"' Eh, they are gathered," said the Count.
'Indeed f" said Mr. PICKWICK.
'They are here," added the Count, tapping his forehead significantly.
"Large book at home—full of noteu—music, picture, science, potry, poltic;
all tings."
A reference to the chapter from which this is an excerpt
will show what were the notes made by the Count of "in-
formation received" and the style and manner of his
entries. We wish Count MATSUGATA every success and "a
good time" in Petersburg, so that, on his leaving, his
favoured acquaintances may sing his praises as did Mrs.
LEO HUNTER and "a chorus of bystanders." "Wonderful
man, Count SMORLTORK!" "Sound Philosopher," said Mr.
Pott. "Clear-headed, strong-minded person," added Mr.
Snodgrass.

We are to get up at four in the morn-

will all be too full and we must get to
our seats by eight at the very latest.
ARTHUR and I are taking a box of
chocolates with us in case we get
hungry, as the Procession doesn't pass
till lunch-time. Papa says we must buy
some Bovril lozenges for you. We are
all to bring waterproofs, as the stand is
not covered in and it may rain. Besides,
they will be useful to sit on, as the
seats are sure to be wet. After the
Procession has passed we shall try and
get something to eat somewhere, but I

WHO GOES ABROAD?
Now sinks the peace of curtained gloom
On talkers lingeringly belated,
And golden silence fills the room
Of speech at best electro-plated.
Here ends the actual Seventh Clause!
And lo! our children's Educators,
Haggard with faking dubious laws,
Burst out in tweeds and sporting gaiters.
Some to the moorlands flit away
In quest of grouse or vulgar rabbits,
Intent to snatch their early prey
Before it learns elusive habits.
Others, whose taste for game is marred
By inability to fell it,
Will urge against the bunker's guard
The scarcely less innocuous pellet.
Gourmands, whose girth is witness to
The New Procedure's pause for dinner,
Will hie to Homburg and pursue
The water-course that leaves you thinner;
While some, impelled by no disease,
But just the tripper's fine afflatus,
Will seek Lugano's grateful breeze
Or lap the mists that crown Pilatus.
And there, with low obsequious bow.
Mine host, of Fatherland extraction,
Will brush their boots and disavow
His country's anti-British action.
Who would recall—so swift the play
Of flattering tongue and smile tliat flutters—
What filth his fellows flung our way
From Berlin's insalubrious gutters?
Or, tickled by his vocal trill,
While other Deutschers growl like thunder,
Hint reasons why he would not kill
The goose that laid the golden plunder?
'Tis true that, now the war 's at close,
I catch from Germany a rumour
How her official prints propose
To readjust their sense of humour—
That's well! But I reserve my heart,
Lashed by a stout and steely tether,.
For such as take my country's part
In heavy, as in halcyon, weather.
Therefore, although my native beach
Just now rthink of taking root on,
My spirit flies to where the speech,
But not the local tone, is Teuton.
Thither my body too should fare,
Nor leave my ego split in sections,
Only I simply could not bear
To brutalize these Swiss affections;
For there, where Love and Nature flow
. Alike with milk (condensed) and honey,
My gratitude could never go
And take the shape of sordid money!
Nay, nay, mine host, be very sure
1 dearly prize your troth's persistence,
But, just to prove your motives pure,
I '11 let you love me from a distance! 0. S.
THE WAY THEY SHOULD HAVE IN THE ARMY.
[" He was driving, when he narrowly avoided running over a man. The
man (wore, and the lieutenant cut at him with liis whip. The man seized
the whip and thrashed the officer with it about the head. He then flung the
whip in his far", and made off. Upon the matter coming to the knowledge of
the offioers of the Hussar Begiment they formed a court of honour, and found
that the lieutenant was guilty of a breach of the regulations in not cutting
IIH assailant down, and sentenced him to expulsion from the regiment—
which, of course, means from the army."—Daily Eiprta.~\
MILITARY honour is proverbially a tender plant, but in
Austria it seems, according to this story, to be almost too
tender to bear the light. Mr. Punch hopes it is not true
that Mr. BRODRICK has under his consideration the following
regulations for the preservation of the honour of British
officers against the brutal civilian :—
1. Should an officer, meeting a civilian, observe that he
looks at him too hard, he shall draw his sword and threaten
the said civilian.
2. Should the civilian continue to look at him the officer
shall, after warning, beat him with the flat of his sword.
3. Should the civilian utter unseemly words or otherwise
retort, the officer shall use the point of his sword so as to
draw blood, the amount of blood to be determined by the
unseemliness of the language of the said civilian.
4. Saould the civilian thereupon attempt to strike, knock,
or otherwise wound the officer, the latter shall cut off the
arm with which the said civilian attacks him.
5. Should the civilian, in spite of this, and in defiance of
all rules of honour, succeed in striking, knocking, or other-
wise wounding the officer, the latter shall at once cut him
into six pieces, after which he shall spring up to attention.
AT.B.—Paragraph 5 does not apply to Volunteer officers,
who are only required to cut their assailant into four pieces,
after which they must spring up to attention.
THE FLIRT EXCUSED.
[" The woman flirt is a very amiable sinner, lends new zest to the sunshine,
brightens the flowers, helps to pass the time. Her sinning arises, in moit
rases, from an innocent desire to please the other sex. Who would be
ungrateful enough to quarrel with so mumble an object?"—The Lady'i
Pustorial.]
IT 's kind of you, MABEL my love, to unbend
To your masculine friends and relations
And on heart-broken, world-weary mo rials to spend
The wealth of your sweet fascinations.
Your sensitive nature I surely should hurt
If I treated your ways with suspicion,
For I know that, though others may call you a flirt
You are really fulfilling a mission.
There's poor Captain JOXES, who is satisfied quite
That his lot is what's known as a " hard "un,"
How thoughtful you showed yourself, MABEL, List night,
When you took him that stroll in the garden!
While CHARLEY DE VEUE, at her ladyship's ball,
Seemed dullest and saddest of dancers,
Till with you he 'd sat out, in a nook of the hall,
Six valses and two sets of lancers.
At dinners, at picnics, at balls you refuse
To no one your life-giving potion;
The men that you've cured of the dumps and the blues
Outnumber the sands of the ocean.
But since your^attee is somewhat depressed,
And clouds o'er his happiness lower,
Oh! won't you give some of your patients a rest,
And grant him a taste of your power?
TIIEUE is an old English family in which at least beautiful
women should always be found. For what would the PEELS
be without a fair number of belles?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CORONATION HATS AND THE
FIRST COMMISSIONER.
(To Mr. Punch.)
tSiR,—It is quite likely that you will
not receive this till after the Coronation,
as the posts from this village are infre-
quent enough on ordinary occasions,
and disappear almost entirely when
confronted by a Bank Holiday and
a Sunday. Moreover, even you will
have been holiday-making, and neglect-
ing to fill your numerous waste-paper
baskets with your usual correspondence.
So you may not know till it is over
that I am not going to the Coronation
at all.
I am by nature a brave man. I
should have faced undaunted the in-
numerable terrors of the English
climate; of the English crowds—so
noisy since Mafeking night; of the
English horns, whistles, squeaks,
ticklers, and all the other instruments
of national, if not rational, rejoicing;
I should have braved the threatened
dangers of fire, of falling stands, of
prolonged, fatigue; I should even have
tried to gaze, without feeling ill, at many
o£ the so-called " decorations," whether
English or Italian; but I could not
face, from behind, the ladies' hats.
Why pay for a seat, even at greatly
reduced prices, only to survey a mass
of millinery?
So I fled to this secluded spot. I
may remark that there is no millinery
here, but that the villagers seem to
be providing themselves with horns,
whistles, squeaks, ticklers, &c., for the
great occasion.
It was all very well for you to
try your best, but I am sure even-
woman would say that you, Mr. Punch,
are such a good-natured old dear that
you could not really object to her new
hat, which is only a quarter of a yard
high—well, perhaps it is nearer three-
quarters of a yard, if anyone is so
silly as to measure to the top of the
feathers.
No, Mr. Punch, there is only one
man who could have secured justice for
the male spectators, the responsible
Minister, the First Commissioner of
Works, and he was too frightened.
Poor, timid Mr. AKEits-DouGLAS, at
last he and his subordinates have been
defeated. He who is so meek and un-
assuming, and his nominal subordinate,
Lord ESHER, who is of course the same,
have not feared to grapple with the
problems of the new Government Offices,
and to design them, as they think, with
greater skill than the original architects.
They have not feared, without assisting
the traffic in the least, to widen the
widest part of Piccadilly, and ruin its
appearance for ever. Last June they even

SHAKSPEARE ILLUSTRATED.
'BtJT THOU ART FAtK, AND AT THY BIRTH, DEAR BOY,

ventured to transform the front of the
National Gallery into a mass of wood
apparently arranged for a bonfire, but
happily so soaked by rain that intending
seatholders upon it were compensated for
the prospect of inevitable rheumatism by
the reflection that the national pictures
behind it were safe. Mr. AKERS-I)OUGLAS
and the others never uttered a word of
protest against similar preparations for
a bonfire around St. Paul's Cathedral.
Nor have they protested against the
destruction of the trees in St. Margaret's
churchyard by an obstinate parson. By
Mr. A'KERS - DOUGLAS and the other
officials, equally ignorant of the arts,
the new Record Office is said to be a
thing of beauty. In all these matters,
he, and Lord ESHER and the others have
conclusively shown that they think
they know better than anybody else, and
now at last they have been completely
bowled over by some women's hats.
But the First Commissioner did Lord
ESHER an injustice. He, at least, would
never have feared to rush in and pre-
scribe the headgear even of angels. He
would have drawn up rules for hats and
regulations for toques and a complete
Building Act for bonnets. Is it con-
ceivable that he would have been
frightened by a feather or beaten by a
bow? Never! But Mr. AKERS-DOOGLAS
did not give him the chance of issuing
an edict, and he was too timid to do it
himself.
So I have abandoned all idea of seeing
the Procession, or, rather, the hat which
would have hidden it entirely.
Yours obediently,
Mudby-in-the-Marsh, C. LITTLE.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS.
VET.—THE JKiNG's PEACE.
IT is Coronation night, and I have
come out—more from a feeling of
dogged obstinacy than from any other
reason—to see the illuminations. To
tell the truth I am determined to be
able to say that I have enjoyed the
Coronation, and hitherto fortune has
not smiled upon me. For the greater
part of the day I have been standing in
tight boots, wedged in between two
stertorous foreigners—who seem to have
breakfasted on a sole diet of garlic—
this, in order eventually to be rewarded
with a glimpse of two white plumes and
the top of a lance. But to-night my
chance of enjoyment is at any rate as
good as that of the seated plutocrats of
the day.
The prevalent spirit seems to be a
determination to express complete satis-
faction. It is well voiced, I think, by
a festive navvy who, holding up his
hand for a silence which is not granted,
observes, "Fellow-countrymen! Peace
'as been 'claimed, and to-day the KINO
'as been crowned. 'Ooray!" and
promptly goes to sleep against a shop-
front. It is a general feeling which
has different methods of expression. A
large number seem to find it an adequate
reason, for knocking off other people's
hats. Numerous choral bands are con-
clusively expressing their loyalty and
ratifying the Peace by aiming ingenious
blows with bladders at the heads of
respectable people — of whom I am
one.
This does not increase my enjoyment
of the evening; further, I have to submit
to the ignominy of being addressed as
BERTIE, and tickled in the face with
peacock's feathers by muscular ladies to
whom I am certain that I have never
had an introduction. I am particularly
struck by the irrelevancy of the song
part of the demonstration. One gentle-
man has arrayed himself from head to
foot in a huge Union Jack in order
repeatedly to break the news of his
impending departure from DOLLY. An
unescorted lady in a tricolor paper
cap ia making an impersonal appeal to
be buried by the old yew tree, a sugges-
tion which, to my regret, nobody seems
ready to act upon.
As I contemplate all this, a bullet-
headed young man of ruffianly aspect
steps up to me, and without troubling
to speak, motions to me that he requires
the aid of my cigarette. At this he
proceeds to light what looks like half
a dirty cigarette paper screwed round
some sand. As he does so there is a
sudden and violent interruption.
Kollop!
A bladder-wielding party have picked
off my companion on the back of his
bullet head. In an instant he swings
round, and lets out like lightning with
his foot, and simultaneously one of the
bladder-wielders sits down heavily in a
winkle-stall. The next moment I am
aware that another of the party has
dropped the bladder of peace, and is
aiming a blow with his fist at my head.
There is no time for explanations; I
stoop and tackle the man "low," and
he measures his length on the pave-
ment.
It seems to me that an explanation
would now be out of place. The bullet-
headed young man has disappeared
with a completeness that borders on the
miraculous. I turn and walk away
from the scene of action, not without a
feeling of elation. I have acquitted
myself as a Briton should. It is but a
few hours since I witnessed the inspir-
ing pageant of two white plumes and
the top of a lance. I am a son of the
Empire. At the same time I feel that
it will be advisable to take the next 'bus.
With these reflections I step firmly—
and briskly—into the road. Suddenly
I am seized from behind by the collar.
I turn, and in a moment find myself the
centre of an excited group of the
bladder fraternity.
"D'you know what you've done?"
yells their loudest spokesman, punctuat-
ing his remarks upon my person.
"You've killed my pal, that's what
you've done. You 11 jest come back
with us. We've sent for a copper."
I endeavour to enter into explanations,
but without success. I am hustled
back by a yelling group, growing larger
every moment, to where the man whom
I had "tackled low" is lying on his
back unskilfully simulating insensibility.
The loudest of my escort is becoming too
vigorous in the punctuation of his
remarks to suit my taste. I manage to
get my back to a shop-front, and find
myself facing an unpleasantly large
crowd.
"You'll jest see acopper about this!"
yells the fidus Achates of the deceased.
I assure the mob, and with truth,
that I am perfectly ready to do so. It
is the course that I should myself have
chosen. The crowd is increasing every
moment. ACHATES has circulated a
report that I have knocked a man down
and kicked him to death. The mob is
expressing its opinion that such a pro-
ceeding is un-English. ACHATES' policy
of fetching a policeman seems to be
superseded by a general desire for my
blood. One man on the outskirts of
the crowd is original enough to
suggest that my defence should be
given a hearing. I catch a glimpse
directly afterwards of his prudently
hasty departure. It is here that I have
a sudden recollection of my form-
master at school describing Public
Opinion as "a splendid safeguard."
I begin to have serious fears that the
KING s Coronation is about to be marred
by the loss of a valuable subject, and,
changing my attitude, endeavour to
convey the impression of a wholesome
fear of police interference.
ACHATES becomes exultant.
"Don't you think you 're goin' to get
orf," he yells—colon here, on my
chest—"You'll spend the night in a
cell, I can tell yer."
I sincerely hope he may prove a true
prophet. As it is, I am more than appre-
hensive of spending the night with the
rest of time as unrecognisable remains.
"Yer friend got away, did 'e?" con-
tinues ACHATES—double mark of inter-
rogation— " but you won't. You'll
swing for this."
At this point there is a diversion in
the middle of the crowd, and I gather
that my victim has returned from the
land of the dead.
At the same moment I feel a tug at
my sleeve. I turn, and am confronted
by a wizened little man wearing a
Coronation button.
"Look 'ere, Sir," he remarks con-
fidentially, " you're in a myenority 'ere."
I am bound to admit it.
"If you take my advice, Sir," he
continues, "you'll clear out o' this."
I express my gratitude for this valu-
able counsel. But the little man is a
man of action. Taking me by the arm
he begins to pull me roughly through
the mob, whose attention has to some-
extent been transferred to the mira-
culous resurrection of my victim. How
the little man does it I cannot altogether
understand, but in half a minute he has-
me outside the crowd, and is walking
with me down the road. A few
vegetable missiles find their billet in the
back of my neck. The occasion strikes
me as a suitable one for hailing a cab.
I offer the little man a solid token of
my appreciation, but he will take
nothing.
"That's all right, Sir," he says.
"You were in a myenority. You drive
off 'ome, that's my advice to you."
I am unable to prevail upon him.
"That's all right, Sir," he repeats.
"Good-night, Sir. I saw you was in a
myenority."
The little Samaritan glides down a
side street. The cab starts off, and,
leaning back with a sigh of relief, I
meditate on the blessings of Peace.
First Johnnie. Hullo, old chappie,
what did you do for the Coronation?
Second Johnnie. Oh, well, old man, I
didn't overstrain myself: but I felt
something was expected of me, so I wore
a Coronation necktie.

CORONATION NOTES.
MANY 'buses had Grand Double Fares
in honour of the Coronation. Others,
determined not to be outdone in loyalty,
trebled theirs.
One enterprising 'bus labelled " Mam-
moth Fares!" attracted large numbers
of country people.
A short-sighted gentleman in the
stand erected in Parliament Square
created a scene by insisting on Lord
BEACONSFIELD sitting down.
One of the most wonderful features
of the Coronation was the temporary
addition to Westminster Abbey. It was
absolutely impossible to say where the
old left off and the new began, and
those who know their British Workman
fear that, unless very careful instruc-
tions are given, when the time arrives
to remove the temporary structure, the
whole of the Abbey may be pulled
down.
Business capacity was more apparent
than good taste in some of the decora-
tions. For instance:—
"His MAJESTY EATS JONES'S PICKLED
PINEAPPLE.
LONG LIVE THE KING !''
"MAKY JAUE" writes that those who
did not see Kensington Gardens a few
days before the Coronation missed
something worth seeing. It was got
up exactly like Paradise. It was one
mass of soldiers.
Three fashionably-dressed kdies, who
had booked seats through an agent,
made a regrettable scene when they
drove up in their carriage on Saturday.
They then discovered they had to sit
behind a glass shop-window bearing
the words, "The Cheapest Hats in
London."
But that was really nothing to the
fuss made by the two spinster sisters
whose day was entirely spoiled by the
notice, similarly placed, "Must be
cleared. No offer refused."
If the gentleman from the New Cut
who found the Handsome Gold Watch,
lost by a Gentleman from Belgraviu in
the crowd on Coronation Night, will
call on the hitter, he will be suitably
rewarded.
The merry little shoe-black who
greeted one of our Dusky Visitors with
tlie question, "Shine your face, Sir?"
expects to be out of the hospital in a
fortnight.
The gentleman who, on Saturday
night, when out to view the decora-
tions, climbed a creeper made of paper
to pluck a xylonite apple, lies in a
precarious condition.
Great diversity of opinion prevailed
among noble lords as to the correct

fashion of wearing a coronet at the
Abbey last week. Lord SALISBUHY, I
hear, wore his tipped over his nose.
Lord ROSEBEUY'S, on the contrary, was
perched negligently on the back of his
head, while Lord LANSDOWNE, perhaps
in memory of his recent connection
with the War Office, had his cocked
jauntily over one ear like a forage cap.
The limited amount of seating accom-
modation provided for each peeress
at the Coronation gave rise to incon-
venience in many cases. Thus Lady
PORTLY and Lady REGULAR - BIGGUN,
whose seats were next one another, at
once realised that the number of inches
allotted to each of them was miserably
inadequate. The difficulty was, how-
ever, settled in a friendly fashion, the
two ladies drawing lots to decide which
of them should stay away.
The problem of securing sufficient
nourishment during the Jong hours
which elapsed between taking their
seats in the Abbey and the entrance of

several great ladies. The Duchess of ST.

Lady DYSPEPSIA TOMPKINS, being a

tiously on lentils, while Lady MIDAS ate
meat-juice out of a tin with a gold spoon.

A CANTO OF CLARET.
(To W. J. J.)
ON an evening—oh, it was long ago
In the years when life had a rosy glow,
When each black cloud, though we never feared it,
Yielded and faded the more we neared it,
Like a thin wan mist by the sun's rays scattered;
And nothing at all in the wide world mattered,
Nothing but joy and the right to choose it,
And the strength of our arms and the right to use it;
When gold, not ingot or coin or bar,
But better and richer and rarer far,
Was ours, not toiled for or snatched for or groped for,
In the friends we had and the friends we hoped for,
All of them tested and staunch and truthful,
And all, like ourselves, immensely youthful—
On a certain evening in mid-November
We sat and we talked—do you remember?
And all of a sudden, neat and thin,
A third to our party came gliding in;
Neat and thin and sedate and prim,
With a fine smooth cap, and a dress so prim
That the least rough movement might disarrange it;
And a look—but 1 didn't wish to change it—
Fixed and soljer and cool and quiet,
With never a hint of noise or riot;
So calm and gentle that, but for staring,
We might have missed when a fire came flaring
Forth from his eyes, so swift and bright
As the sparks from a horse's hoofs at night,
When the road gleams out by his gallop fired—
So quickly it flashed and so expired.
Then he looked you here and he looked you there,
And I thought, thought I, I must speak him fair.
He 's a gentleman, every inch, that's clear;
So let him be welcome and sit down here;
And if he can talk, so much the better:
Right gladly I '11 listen, and be his debtor
For a story told, and, unless I 'm cheated,
It's bound to be good—so I said, "Be seated;
Be seated, friend, at your utmost ease,
And tell us your story, if you please." "Tis."
(To be continued.)
Rice v. Confetti.
IT seems that in Siam there is still a preference for the
old custom of discharging rice at wedding festivities. Thus
we read in Router's cable from that region: "Six hundred
Shans still hold Muang Pray .... They are collecting rice
and making ammunition."
The account goes on to say, "The Shans have killed
twenty-five Siamese officials .... Eight Europeans remain
at Pray."
We fear there is folly in this contempt of danger. As
the poet said: "And fools that came to Pray, remained to
scoff."

HODGE'S masterpiece. When he ap-
proached the Table, instead of bowing
in ordinary fashion, he halted, brought
his heels together with snap, above
which you could almost hear the jang-
ling of spurs; with sweep of arm
carried stiff right hand to touch his
martial brow in salute of SPEAKER.
Mystery solved when House got into
Committee of Supply. Army Estimate
under consideration. All the colonels
mustered on parade. C.-B., whose
scorn of week-enders is well known,
went away on Thursday; hasn't been
seen since. On eve of departure con-
fided Leadership of Opposition to BRYCE.
The anguish BRYCE went through on
Friday night, when he endeavoured to
keep HUMPHREYS-OWEN straight on his
amendment to Seventh Clause of Edu-
cation Bill, temporarily prostrated a
frame undermined by ascent in early
life of Mount Ararat. Post of Leader
of Opposition accordingly delegated to
Sir WALTER FOSTER, M.D., Consulting
Physician, author of that popular work
The Use of Spliyymograpli in Heart,
Disease.
At proper time, when a few colonels
and such-like had spoken, FOSTER fell
in and delivered luminous address from
Front Opposition point of view on
general policy of the War Office, with
special reference to judgment in horse
flesh and accuracy of range with the
wind in the south-west. BRODRICK, who
followed in defence of his Department,
was rather nasty. Valuable remarks,
he observed, had been made by gallant
gentlemen on either side of the House;
but he didn't think much of the contri-
butions of the Member for the llkeston
Division. Some suggestions he had
advanced were impracticable; others
had been in force for some years.
This, however, only professional
jealousy. Nothing war veterans dislike
more than to see a civilian poking his
nose into the barracks. During the
siege of Paris GAMDETTA, it will be
remembered, suffered from this pre-
judice.
Business done.—Fourscore votes in
Army Estimates passed as quickly as
Members could march round Division
Lobbies.

it pours, especially in Cowes Week.
STANLEY has had much to put up with
lately, including Mr. WEIR. To-night,
serving his country by explaining what
had become of the vast supply of cloth-
ing sent out to South Africa, was sud-
denly interrspted by SPEAKER with stern
cry of " Order! order!" Happened at
moment to be dealing with the stock
of nether garments. In his haste, spoke
tout court of "trowsers." Vague
recollections of virgin society, where the
~ord was taboo, flashed on his troubled
mind. Was trowser an un-Parliamentary
word? Did reference to it hurt the
delicate sensibilities of Irish Members?
STAKLEY furtively looked across floor to
see if WILLIAM O'BRIEN was in his place.
No.
His next impulse was to withdraw
trowsers—of course I mean the word.
About to withdraw and apologise in
customary fashion when he compre-
hended the situation. It was 10 o'clock;
at that hour, on this particular day, it
was ordained talk should cease and
voting commence. Stranger in gallery,

noon, profoundly puzzled. Had read
something of urgency of situation;

heard the Premier lament the overflow
of business and the scarcity of time.
Had even hinted at necessity for carry-
ing Session over into next week, to the
shattering of domestic plans of Members.
Yet by the hour Mr. WEIR, followed by
Mr. CALDWELL, delivered prodigious
speeches on minute topics before almost
empty benches.
Time thus occupied in the freshest
hours of the sitting, here was the
Financial Secretary to the War Office
interrupted in important speech on
Army Clothing, his cloth, so to speak,
suddenly snipped. And all on the
score of urgency, of the preciousness of
time, of the weight of business that
overwhelmed a working assembly!
Closure enforced, some 300 gentle-
men of respectable, even sane, appear-
ance spent hour or two in walking
round the Lobbies. "Passing the
Report Stage of Supply," the wise call
it.
Business done.—Appropriation Bill
brought in.
Thursday night.—After long, Labori-
ous Session Mr. WEIR, packing up his
pince-nez, goes off to his moor with
contented mind. In these closing days
of first division of Session has had his
hour of triumph.
Has brought Financial Secretary to
the War Office to his knees ; has pounded
Pall Mall with blows, the sound of
which fell upon alarmed ears in the
equally faulty Department at Whitehall.
All about the remounts. Report cur-
rent that a number of horses at Stellen-
bosch, fed with chaff, had retorted with
glanders. Consequence was, six hundred
had to be shot.
"As a rule," says STAKLEY, with fine
irony, "glanders is not a disease horses
catch through eating chaff."
Frivolity of remark touched Mr. WEIR
to the quick. "The noble lord," he
said, pumping up funereal voice from
its tomb in his boots, "defends the
practice of feeding horses with chaff."
"I did nothing of the kind," said
STANLEY; which was, indeed, the truth.
"Very well," said Mr. WEIR, waving
him off; "a most unsympathetic reply
—most imsympathetic. Will the noble
lord deny that the horses had the
glanders? No, Mr. LOWTHER, he can't.
Then, why quibble? Does he deny the
horses were fed with chaff? or that in
consequence six hundred of them were
shot? Ah, Mr. LOWTHT.R, I'm thinking
of my poor cottars in the Highland* and
islands, who will have to go without
many a half-ounce of tobacco. A most
unsympathetic speech. I shall move
the reduction of the Vote by £100."
In vain Members near besought him
not to put Committee to trouble of
Division. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir WALTER
FOSTER, V.C., rising from front Opposi-
tion bench, with colourable imitation of
the Squire of Malwood's figure and
manner, recommended him, as his Leader
pro tern., to withdraw. Mr. WEIR was
obdurate.
"Most unsympathetic speech," he
murmured; "feeding horses with
chaff!"
There was, perhaps, personal feeling in
this last matter. Six hundred horses
fed with chaff at Stellenbosch had
succumbed to glanders. In House of
Commons Mr. WEIR always being chaffed.
Who could say what might not happen?
Anyhow, " an unsympathetic answer bv

tempted to dissuade him. Mr. WARNER
rose from bench immediately below and
made a personal appeal.
For all answer, Mr. WEIR said, "I 'm
thinking of my poor HigManders."
How they came to be dragged in,
whether in connection with the chaff or
the glanders, did not appear. Mr. WARKER

ACCORDING to one of the best-informed
French papers Lord SALISBURY has,
since his resignation, accepted service
as a spy in the employ of the British
Government, and is to reside at
Beaulieu.
Will the French ever understand us?
In a not very friendly article on the
War, just published in one of their
journals, there are some ridiculous mis-
takes. Lord ROBERTS, throughout, is
referred to as "le venerable Robber,"
and the High Commissioner is always
"le lord Millionaire."
The much-advertised Motor Race in
the Ardennes turned out to be a poor
affair after all, not a single person being
killed.
The War Office has officially approved
of Motor Cars for the Army, and it now
only remains to adopt the wrong sort.
General YOSHONINA, Chief of the Staff
of the Japanese Army, is in this country
studying British Army methods. Last
week he was shown Sandhurst College.
"England," as someone said, " does not
seek alliances."
The statement that Boss CKOKER, of
Tammany fame, intends to enter English
Society is untrue. The rumour probably

While thousands my progress retard.
From banquet to banquet I rush,
To dine in the popular gaze;
Men's plaudits my modesty flush—
I feast on a surfeit of praise.
There come deputations in hordes,
Whose eloquence nought can abate;
My armoury bristles with swords—
I 'm glutted with caskets and plate.
Ah! what shall recover for me
The rest I am hankering for?

To peace once again at the war!

SWITCH IS IT?
SIR,—In Spectator for August 2, a correspondent, writing
about KEATS and Corporal Flogging (good military sounding
grade this !) signs himself " ONE OF THE SWITCHED." He may
be correct in his spelling (" switch-back " is right, but this
was invented after his time and KEATS'S), though, personally,
being an Eton boy (or rather having been one—but once an
Eton boy always an Eton boy, for Etonian youth is perennial),
I never heard this word pronounced as spelt by this corre-
spondent of the Spectator's. In my time, Sir, "swished"
was the invariable pronunciation; we never had to spell it,
as far as I remember, when Dr. HAWTREY administered the
backwardation. To view this retrospectively is, what may be
termed, of the very essence of the matter. I feel almost as
certain of the spelling of this word as I do of its pronuncia-
tion, though, perhaps, now-a-days, I would not for my
opinion go to the block, not even on the chance of obtaining
remission by pleading " first fault." Yours,
A MERRY SWISH Bor.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The first volume of Parliament, Past and Present
(HUTCHTNSON), a popular picturesque account of a thousand
years in the Palace of Westminster, is just out. It confirms
the impression recorded in this column on reading the first
of the fortnightly parts. My Baronite chances to know
something of Parliament during the last thirty years. But
he has learnt a great deal from a study of this volume. Mr.
ARNOLD WRIGHT and Mr. PHILIP SMITH, old parliamentary
hands, joint authors, have done their work admirably.
They have left no stone unturned, no record unsearched,
for the illumination of their record. Its value is enhanced
by the reproduction of a multitude of valuable, not easily
accessible, paintings and engravings. Parliament., Past and
Present, is the best thing of the kind yet done. It will
remain the standard work on a subject that has undying
fascination for the English-speaking race abroad and at
liome. THE BARON DE B.-W.
HOW IT STRIKES A YANKEE.
You ask me what I think, JOHN? Wai, I 've jest ben lookin'
round
An" sizin' up tilings gen'ally, sence I struck English
ground.
I 've ben here now for quite a spell—sence June, I b'lieve,
an' so
I think I 'm in position to express my views below.
When I see Injun Princes, yes, an' Fiji niggers, too,
An' strappin' lads from New South Wales, an' that New
Zealand crew,
An' all the rest that gathered here for just one single thing,
To show their loyal homage to their EMPEROE an' KING,
Why, JOHN, I tell ye, it's a sight I never kin forget!
It stirred up my old blood-pump so that—wal—it's stirria'
yet!
An' tho' I am a Yankee, JOHN, a loyal Yankee, too,
I couldn't help a-1'eeliu' proud that I come down from you!
I ain't forgot, JOHN, what you did, when I was fightin'
Spain,
When my boy DEWEY, in the East, was givin' them a pain;
Ye know some fellows poked a nose where noses didn't
b'long,
An' GEORGE, he didn't waste no time in sayin' it was wrong.
An' when them fellers come to you, to find out what you
tho't,
You didn't say a blessed word; but, JOHN, you looked a lot!
That kind o' thing I can't forget, because—wal—I dunno,
The words won't come exactly, JOHN—but—shake! Thar—
now, ye know!
An', then, JOHN, there's some other things that link us, old
and young
Our idees are about the same, 'n' we speak one mother
tongue;
We 've had our little scrappin', JOHN, but now we 've drawn
the line,
It ain't on your mind much, I guess; I know it ain't on
mine.
You. 're hard to know, JOHN, sometimes, but when you let
down the bars
There 's not a better feller underneath the sun an' stars!
I poke my fun at you, JOHN, an' you poke your fun at me.
But 't 's all in best of feeliri', cause we understand, you see!
But if some other feller tried to git a little gay,
We mightn't be so playful: ain't that true, JOHN, what I say?
So let me tell ye sonietliin' on the strict "Q.T."—
"strict, con." —
Because it's jest 'tween you an' me, and no one else is "on."
If anyone comes nosin' 'round, and lookin' kinder " fly,"
An' possibly gits over-bold an' holds hisself too high,
Jest bear in mind, now, wliat I say in confidence to you:

AH, what is Poetry? You ask.
A thousand criticasters try
The all-unprofitable task,
And of their ignorance reply.
She is a Maid, say some, who sips
The waters of the sacred well,
And whom she favours, from his lips
Shall sweetest numbers rise and
swell.
She is a Zephyr; poets' souls
Are her ..Holian harps. She sighs
Upon their chords and music rolls—
She passes, and their music dies.
Or she is Love—the wondrous light
That shines in lovers' hearts and
shows
A world all magically bright,
A universe cotdeur de rose.
Or she is Genius—the art
To know what Truth and Justice be;
The thinking mind, the feeling heart,
The ear to hear, the eye to see.
She is a question of the brains—
Grey matter present in excess;
No doubt the two parental strains
Were both a bit abnormal, yes!
Words, words, mere windy words, to
hide

With verbiage less and meaning

with the manipulation of verbal parti-

established in a contemporary's account
of the Surrey and Yorkshire match:—
"Rolling out to a grand wicket, the
Surrey men commenced in promising

When you growl like a bear,
Or jump up and swear
"f a plate is put down with a clatter,
And are quite at a loss
To explain why you 're cross
And what in the world is the matter—
When you don't want to live,
And the thought that you give
To your business is fretful and cursory,
And you 're sulky at meals,
And can't bear the squeals
That (as usual!) proceed from the
nursery—
When you snarl and you snap,
And you don't care a rap
For the horrible way you 're behaving,
And you frequently mention
Your rooted intention
Of cutting your throat while you 're

When you ponder all day
On the easiest way
Of drowning yourself in the river,
It's a comfort, I find,
To keep clearly in mind
That it's probably only your liver!

"I was BtnyiiiR at a fashionable hotel on the East coast, whose name I do

in evening dress at my table. Now I wish to openly protest to such treat-
ment. I think that the manager of such a hotel ouent to either ineixt on
evening dress at dinner being indispensable, or he ought at least to seatthocc
visitors who are dressed apart from those who are not."
Mr. Punch is horrified to learn that there are people on
the East coast who do not
dress for dinner, and he
entirely sympathises with
the indignant gentleman.
The least that the manager
of a hotel should have
done in the circumstances,

would have been to give

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN Immortal Youth (HUTCHINSON) Mr. MORLEY ROBERTS has
written a book which attempts to do for a certain phase of
life in London what MURQER achieved for Paris in his Vie de
Boheme. My Baronite is surprised to learn that between
the two cities, then and now, there is common ground that
makes such work possible. Mr. MORLEY ROBERTS knows, or
at least conveys the assurance of knowledge. Nevertheless,
the idea of an A.R.A. unexpectedly returning from a busi-
ness visit to Manchester, finding his wife, drunk with wine,
attempting to renew earlier intimacy with a nice-looking
young novelist and poet, is new to one having a pretty close
acquaintance with the personnel of the Royal Academy.
The keynote of the book is struck in a remark by Parker
Fullerton, George Vincent Lacy's mentor in the ways of
London life. "Respectability," says the sage, "is a form of
ignorance." Mr. ROBERTS, in fashion possibly a trifle bold
for enervated taste, dispels ignorance, unveils respectability.
Without exception, his puppets are a shady lot. But th,ey
dance in lively fashion, not without display of ankle on the
part of the ladies.
The Mystery of the Sea (HEINEMANN) is a rattling story
which sometimes recalls Monte Cristo, anon Treasure
Island. Through it all beams the breezy personality of
BRAM STOKER. The scene is set by the curved shore of
Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire. The wild scenery by day and
night Mr. STOKER describes with loving touch and master
hand. The basis of the plot is discovery of hidden treasure,
information respecting which naturally comes from corre-
spondents in Spain. They are, however, not the shady
parties Mr. LABOUCHERE devotes the leisure of a useful life to
unmasking. The treasure originally belonged to the POPE,
who contributed it to the expenses of the Armada. The
San Cristobal that was, as the wise say, "conveying" the
treasure, sank in Cruden Bay. How Archibald Hunter was
led to the discovery of the gold and gems, how he found
still greater treasure in the person of a charming American
girl, is told with unfailing animation and marvellous skill.
Amongst many powerful scenes is that wherein Lauchlane
Macleod's desperate attempt to swim ashore, when Lammas
Flood swirled round the broken masses of rock known as
"The Skares," is vividly described. My Baronite finds in
the book the rare quality of adventure that enthralls the
boys and pleases their parents.
The Baron has just tumbled across, without in the least
damanging his shins, a little book of lectures on Company
Drill, published (by WILLIAM CI.OWES AND SONS) a couple of
months or so ago, viz. during " the season " when Company
Drill would have been most valuable to many a debutant
(not debutante, quite another, and far smaller, pair of shoes),
and written by Major GEORGE NUGENT, of the Irish Guards.
This opusculum is so fascinating in its poetical descriptions of
"manoeuvres " as to bring the Baron up at " the halt," and
almost induce him to "change position," being ever in
"right form," giving his entire " attention" to " squads,"
"inspection," "fixing and porting arms," and to "quick
marching" "from the halt to the halt." But on second
thoughts, seeing that there is question of "Passing Defiles
and Obstacles," of " Changing Ranks," which he doesn't in
the least wish to do, and of "Marching in Fours" (where-
unto he greatly objecteth), he, the Baron, being aware of an
"Increasing Front," and weighted, as he is, by the responsi-
bility of literary and journalistic "Movements in Lines and
Columns," determines that, after all, it is better, instead of
"Forming a Company" (Limited), to enjoy the society of
those he has about him, Major GEORGE NUGENT being of the
number, and, with Commander-in-Chief PUNCH'S popularity
in view, to "advance" invariably "by the right." Yes,
"Advance by the right" is the lofty moral lesson taught
by the excellent practical military manual which haa here
been "reviiwed by that redoubtable warrior the

Not less pronounced than those of Ares,
Hopes that our guests are nearly through
Their oratorical vagaries;
And even hints the time has come
When Mr. SEDDON might be dumb.
The camps are struck; no more the Row
Reverberates their blown reveille;
Our turbaned chiefs prepare to go
Where things are better done in Delhi;
Taking their memories closely packed
With teeming proofs of British tact!
Rest comes at last; the war is done,
The KING is crowned, the fetes are over;
So let us take what little sun
Is left to warm the season's clover;
He must be hard to please who cares
About " reaction's deadly snares "?
We '11 fold our hands awhile at ease,
And dull our ears to dismal sermons;
What would you have? We hold the seas,
A match for all your jealous Germans!
"Four years from now they '11 be unpleasant?"
Well, our concern is just the present.
As for our " failures in the field
Big with instruction "—why review them?
Their trivial tale is closed and sealed;
Besides, we always worry through them!
Don't let " reform " disturb our sleep;
In any case, the thing will keep.
We 've wealth enough to meet the charge
Of these and even costlier errors;
Let us wax fat and kick at large,
And snap our thumbs at bogey terrors;
While life 's so flush of meat and drink
It seems a waste of time to think! 0. S.

A CANTO OF CLARET.
(To W. J. J.)
[CONCLUDED.]
So our friend sat down, and his voice came slow,
But it wasn't a story at all, you know,
For it didn't begin, and it hadn't a middle,
And there wasn't the least little plot to unriddle,
And you couldn't say, when the voice diminished
And paused at hist, that the tale was finished,
Coffined and clamped and buried deep
In the place where the good and the bad tales sleep,
And never to wake again, you 'd pray,
Till the last trump roused it at Judgment Day.
For, although he spoke, it wasn't a story,
But'a. blaze of light with a trail of glory,
A dragon of fire with all his joints
Gemmed with a circle of ruby points,
His breath like a flaming exhalation,
And his wings one emerald coruscation,
Fanning the sky with a noise of thunder—
A shape that a man might Bee and wonder,
With his matter of fact and his logic banished,
Whence it appeared and whither it vanished;
And now it seemed like the burst sonorous
Of a wonderful magical ancient chorus:
Not a roundelay for a festal dance meant,
But an air with a most divine entrancement,
That lifted you up and made you seem
Like a floating shade in a happy dream,
All thoughts gone that your heart offended,
Your strivings over, your struggles ended;
Nothing left that could now remind you
Of tempests and tossings far behind you;
Envy stifled and anger muffled,
And, born in their place, a calm unruffled,
A marvellous peaceful stretch immense,
Beyond the limits of sight or sense,
Smooth as glass, but with just a swell, too,
A long low swell that you rose and fell to,
With the music to lull you and give you the swing of it,
And you on its surface the one lord and king of it.
And then, it seemed, with a kind of shake up
You 'd 'come to yourself and start and wake up,
And see in a valley green and gay
Brown-faced maidens and boys at play,
Full in the sun on a happy d'ay,
Laughing and singing and fooling and frisking it,
The boys for a kiss and the girls all risking it,
Their eyes so bright that you couldn't but love them,
And a shepherd stretched on the bank above them,
Fingering deftly and blowing neatly
On his oaten pipe till it sounded sweetly
With notes that a wood-nymph might have sung
In the pleasant years when the world was young.
And, lo! you saw with your own two eyes—
Saw it yourself without surprise,
For indeed it seemed a sight to be glad about—
You saw yourself in the thick of the gad-about,
Playing a game that you seemed (fuite pat in,
With a girl to help you wlio whispered Latin,
While you whispered love, or its Latin analogy,
Soft in the ear of your PHYLLIS or LAI-AQE.
And next, like a joyous bird sublime,
You were poised aloft on the winds of Time,
With sun upon sun in the sky to show you
The wide world plain to your sight below you;
And you knew what it meant and how it had risen,
Cause and effect, from its cramping prison,
When first the marvellous word was spoken,
And the bars were burst and the shackles broken,
And, elate with the ordered freedom gained for it,
The globe swung out on the course ordained for it.
And still our friend was telling his tale,
Talking at ease till the light cume pale
Through the rents and chinks of the window curtain
And (this much is sure though the rest is uncertain)
The room was cold, and the lamp was flaring,
And you and I were awake and staring,
Dazed with the tale that we both had heard,
And echoing still with the man's last word,
And thinking him still on the self-same spot there —
Till we rubbed our eyes and, lo! he was not there.
A VERY ARCH BISHOP "IN PARTIBUS;"
Or, There 's many a True Word spoken in Chess.
HAD " JOHN OLIVER HOBBES " ( Mrs. CEAIGIE) and Mr. MURRAY
CARSON ('tis good to be " MURRAY and wise " in collaboration),
joint-authors of The BisJiop's Move, thoroughly worked out
their idea until it had developed itself into a strong plot
with fine dramatic situations, then, with its admirable high-
comedy dialogue, wherein the authors show to griatest
advantage, the play would of itself have deserved the success
which is at present won for it by the perfect acting of all
concerned in the representation. It is a comedy of dialogue,
a sort of "proverbe" extended to three acts, of which the
third, that ought to have been the strongest, is, unfortunately,
just the reverse.
That the clever collaborateurs, after hitting upon the
original idea and after creating so marked a variety of
characters, should have, apparently, tired of their handiwork
and brought it to an abrupt conclusion in a most unsatisfac-
tory manner, is disappointing to all who have followed the
first two acts with growing pleasure and increasing interest.
That the piece owes whatever success it has already
achieved and whatever measure of popularity it may obtain
mainly to Mr. ARTHUR BOURCHIER, who in make-up and acting
has never given us anything better than this impersonation
of Ambrose, Bishop of Ranee; to Miss VIOLET VANBRDGH as
the good-hearted mondaine Duchess of Quenten; to H. B.
WARNER cleverly playing the difficult part of the youthful
Francis Herieourt, the novice who returns to the world
which he ought never to have quitted ;• to Miss JESSIE BATEMAX
as the most ingenuous ingenue, Barbara Arreton; to Mr. KING
HEDLEY, excellent as Monsignor Campden, and to Miss KATE
SERCEANTSON as Mrs. Hericourt, the impulsive mother of
Francis, is a fact, the truth of which " JOHN OLIVER" and her
MURRAY partner would be the first to admit and for which they
must be honestly grateful. It is such artistic acting as this
that ought to attract the public for some time to come.
Indeed, so perfect an impersonation of a Catholic ecclesiastic
(a French bishop, it seems, of English extraction, a sort of
mixed quantity) has not been seen on the stage since LAFON-
TAINE so admirably played the Abbe Constantin, in a play,
charming indeed, but as innocent of plot as is this. The
Abbe Constantin, as a type of the "inferior clergy," took
snuff in considerable quantities, but Monseigneur L'fiveque
takes no such stimulant, though he is quite "up to"
tabac a priser.
By the way, the first act is laid in "the Refectory at the
Abbey of Veyle, near Dinan," in which is hung a picture
that ought never to have been permitted on the walls, or
within the precincts, of a Religious House. The painting is
not essential to the piece, and as for the greater part of the
time it is hidden by curtains (some of this superfluous
drapery might have been spared for the unclothed figure),
the audience, on the rideaux being temporarily withdrawn,

ATHLETES AT BOW STREET.
ON the Bench:—Mr. A. G. STEEL,
K.C., Mr. ANDREW LANG, Mr. A. J.
WEBBE, Mr. JOHN BALL, Junior, Mr.
N. L. JACKSON, and Mr. THOMAS MORRIS.
The following cases were heard :—
WILLIAM GILBERT GRACE, 54, doctor,
was charged with the heinous offence of
perpetual youth.
Sir ROBERT GIFFEN, who appeared for
the prosecution, said that the prisoner
persisted in getting younger every year,
to the confusion of all statistics and the
despair of honest bowlers. Only a few
days ago the prispner, in defiance of all
consideration for the feelings of the
young men who were playing and
looking on, had made his two hundredth
century in first-class cricket; while his
attacks on the wickets of his enemies
were continuous and successful.
Mr. L. B. W. SCHOOLING, who said
that he was an actuary employed by the
Royal Blob Insurance Company, stated
that that Company had been founded
with a capital of 50,000 runs to insure
cricketers against making ducks. They
refused, as a rule, to take anyone
over forty-five. The prisoner was an
exception.
Dr. ANDREW GACKRODGER, medical
officer for Sydenham, said that since
the prisoner came to reside in the
neighbourhood he had set such an
example of health that the incomes of
the general practitioners in the district
had fallen at least 50 per cent.
Sir JAMES CRICHTON BROWNE stated
that in his opinion, after a Jong study
of the subject, the proper age for a
cricketer finally to exchange the field
for the pavilion chairs was forty-three,
unless, of course, he was addicted to
Harris tweeds, in which case he would
be useless much earlier. For a man to
make hundreds when he was fifty-four
was a menace to the medical profession.
Mr. WULLIE PARK, manufacturer of
golfing implements, said that the usual
age at which a man turned from the
freevolity of cricket to the sairiousness
of gowf was thirty-seven. They still
waited to take the prisoner's order, but
in vain. It wasna' fair to trade.

Candidate. "YES, THAT'S JUST IT. I 'M THIS SH.H.I.RHT GIANT ON RECORD!"
Mr. MELCHIZEDEK JONES, a solicitor
representing the family of Old PARR,
speaking for the defence, stated that
old as that impressive figure had grown
to be, there was no evidence that he
ever gave up cricket.
In spite of this interesting parallel
the Bench unanimously condemned the
prisoner to many more years hard labour
in the field. (Applause in Court.)
ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR, 54, described
as Prime Minister, was charged by the
Surrey police with the furious driving
of a motor car.
P.O. HELIX stated that he had orders
on July 32nd to disguise himself as a
working man and ascertain the time of
the prisoner's motor car. He therefore
provided himself with a sundial, and
taking up his post behind a hedge he
waited for the prisoner's approach. It
was quite dark, but he was convinced,
from close scrutiny of the sundial with
the aid of a box of matches, that the
prisoner's car was moving at the rate of
twenty-eight miles four rods and two
perches per hour. This was of course a
gross breach of the new Act governing
auto-mobiles; hence his arrest, and the
present action.
Mr. BALFOUR, having proved that he
was travelling at the rate of only five
miles an hour, was fined ten pounds and
costs.

[AUGUST 20, 1902.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Captain BURBERRY PAXTON, 32, was
charged with assaulting EPHHAIM HENDER-
SON, book-stall clerk at Liverpool Street
station, with his umbrella. t
The prosecutor, who wore his jaw in
a sling, described how Captain PAXTON
had struck him a violent blow with the
silver-mounted handle of his umbrella.
The assault was quite deliberate, and
Captain PAXTON offered no apology,
merely saying, "Why on earth didn't
you stand away from the tee?"
JEREMIAH TIBBLES, railway porter, gave
corroborative evidence. The gentleman
was perfectly sober at the time.
Mr. MARSHALL HALL, K.C., M.P., who
appeared for the defence, said that the
episode admitted of a very simple and
satisfactory explanation. His client,
who had served with distinction in the
North. Berwick Foozle-eers, had been
much upset by the action of the Com-
mittee of the Buncaster Golf Club, who
had put up his handicap from scratch
to 4. He nad accordingly decided to
go down to Buncaster for the week-end,
and while waiting for his train was
practising a half-swing with, his
umbrella near the bookstall, when
HENDERSON suddenly stepped forward
and received the handle full on his jaw.
He had endeavoured to explain matters
at the time, but the clerk was evidently
not a golfer and refused to accept half-
a-sovereign.
Mr. EDWARD BLACKWELL, called for the
defence, stated that home practice was
most effectual, though occasionally
damaging to the furniture. He knew
of no more distressing affliction that
could befall a scratch player than to be
clean off his drive. He thought that
half-a-sovereign for a half-swing was
quite adequate remuneration.
Professor HORACE HUTOHINSON stated
that, as the result of prolonged investi-
gation into the psychology of golf, he
had come to the conclusion that it was
impossible for an enthusiast to refrain
from repeating the gestures germane to
certain phases of the game in totally
incongruous surroundings. He had
seen one of his patients at a dinner
party attempting to loft marrons glacis
into a finger-bowl with a dessert-spoon.
ANTHONY FIDDAMAN, caddie, of Bun-
caster-on-Sea, deposed that he always
carried for Captain PAXTON, who was on
the whole a good-tempered player,
though nervous on the tee.
Cross-examined, he admitted that
Captain PAXTON had expressed the wish
that he could wring the necks of all the
larks at Buncaster, they disturbed hiir
so much on the putting greens.
Further evidence having been given
by Lord BRASSEY, Professor DRIVER, anc
Miss CECILIA LOFTUS, the case waa com-
promised on Captain PAXTON's under-
taking to present HENDERSON with

SUGGESTION FOE A NEW COIFFUEE.

gross of Haskell balls and a quart of
sloe gin.
JOSEPH DARLING, who gave an address
in Australia, was charged with being in
possession of a bunch of English laurels
in the Old Trafford ground at Man-
chester on July 26th.
Many thousands of persons having
deposed that they saw him leaving the
ground with his ten confederates and
the laurels under his arm, P.O. F. W.
TATE of Brighton said that he made a
special effort to stop them, but without
avail. He was acting under the in-
structions of his superior officer, Captain
MACLAREN.
GILBERT JESSOP, whose appearance in
the box was greeted with loud cries oJ
"Bravo, Croucher!" from the gallery,
deposed that the prisoner was un-
doubtedly in possession of the laurels
at the Oval on Monday, August llth
But on the date of the alleged theft
he (the deponent) was unavoidably
absent; while on the later date the
laurels were too far gone to be retrieved
Asked for an explanation, the witness
stated that the strongest trumper alwayi
won the rubber.
Mr. ROBERT THOMS said he had known
the prisoner for some time. He needec
a deal of stopping. It was not, however
theft, but kleptomania, and the onl)
practitioner who could have preventec
the disease from asserting itself at Man
Chester was probably Doctor GRACE.
The prisoner in his very stubborn
defence said that he had come by thi
aurels honestly, though, perhaps, he
'lad been slightly assisted by the Clerk
if the Weather. He liad, in fact, won
hem. This view being shared by the
Jench, he was dismissed with cheers.
*ARCHANGELO, the Flying Demon of
^asmania, was charged with wilfully
lamaging the public roadway. The
eat which ARCHANGELO undertook to
>erform was as follows: Bound hand
and foot, he was in the habit of ascend-
ng in a fire-balloon and dropping head
oremost from a height of not less than
300 feet.
Mr. PIANTAGENET CADBURY, Secretary
o the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Pavingstones, deposed that
he height from which ARCHANGELO
Iropped was often considerably greater
han that advertised, while he was so
mperfectly padded that the impact was
most dangerous to almost any inanimate
ibject on which he happened to alight.
The prisoner, who was wheeled into
jourt on a movable couch, stated that
n the course of ten performances he
lad only broken seven ribs, dislocated
lis vertebras and fractured his occiput.
As, however, he refused to give any
undertaking to discontinue his per-
formance, the Bench ordered him to be
detained for life in the Ping-pong ward
at Hanwell.

Lady. Still, I will say that Madame
peek the paint off anything in the wax
line that we 've seen in Clamville. She'B
got old HENET THE EIGHTH, who over-
loaded himself with wives a few cen-
turies ago, and was never seen to smile
again. And to point a moral example
she's dropped in Sir THOMAS LIPTON,
who 's never done anything in that line
yet, and wears a ten-inch smile and a
curly moustache as though he 'd never
heard of a losing race, and didn't know
what trouble was. Being a single man
perhaps he don't.
Then there was one group that pulled
me up with a jerk, in view of the gaudy
revels that were to have woke up the
old town this month. This was the
crowning of an early British King.
It must have been a scanty sort of
business in those days, or else Madame
was pressed for room when she put
up the tableaux. There was no excited
populace, but only a few straggly
courtiers and a scared-looking Bishop,
while the King looked as if he wished
he hadn't come. But as the school
mann used to tell us, it wasn't always
healthy to be in the monarch business.
There was a likelihood of a near rela-
tive coming along with a band of
interested toughs and a sharp knife,
and tumbling you out oi the coronation
chair before you had time to handle the
income.
Then there 'a a nice gory room down-
stairs where thev 've dumped all the
crime-workers. Now this made me feel
like home and the Sunday edition of
the Mail and Banner, with its scare
headlines and snaps of the murderer
two minutes after the awful deed. I
shall work this up for a special against
the time I come home, so you '11 have to
lay over for a farther description.
Madame's whole show is slick, but, as
I say, an extra dime for a freak show
wouldn't break anyone and would wake
up the proceedings. (Remember when
they tried to run a one-eyed wax-works
on to Clamville, and the boys melted
down GEORGE WASHINGTON in a bonfire
because he looked like the Jew drummer
who 'd filled us up with flash jewellery
and skipped the town before we were
on to it?) Still, I reckon Madame's
figures are authentic, and as an educator
of youth and upholder of monarchy she
ought to do well; but I can't help
feeling sad about those freaks. The
nearest I could find to the old sort was
a man outdoors on the side-walk with
his legs under him looking tearfully at
an orange-coloured fish which he had
sketched in and labelled "A Salm°n-"
If he wasn't a freak the fish was, so I
donated ten cents to the collection and
passed on, feeling good.

me that it's the Academy I 'm want-

ing for art, so I '11 sort that out another
day.
I don't think you 'd be stuck on the
hotel where I 'm located. They 've
never heard of clam chowder, and when
I asked for a canvas-back duck the
Swiss hired man thought I was alluding
to a cock-tail. They serve the green
stuff on different plates, and iced water
is as plentiful as snowstorms in June.
And when I asked for a green cigar
and a schooner of beer in the drawing-
room, the boss said the smoking-room
was downstairs. The newspapers, too,
seem to want a live man behind them.
Why, the Times hasn't interviewed me
yet, and plants the murders on the fifth
page instead of giving them an elegant
rition in the centre, with full details
the victim's aunt.
I '11 just save the mail if I quit.now,
so good luck, PETE, and fix me up
with the news if business ain't too
tight. JAKE.
P.S.—I 'm not quite satisfied with
young ELI. That slush he 's dropping
in the Mail and Banner don't seem to
fit at all. You used to be a pretty
hand at drafting a circular, so I wish
you 'd take a turn and , fake some-
thing readable. The sea-serpent is a
corpse, and^the nigger woman who 's a
hundred and forty and remembers
seven Presidents won't stand another
season; but you might do something
with a returned miner from the Yukon.
Make him frost-bitten and full up of tales
of savage tribes, and he '11 do. The
paper wants life. If there 's no truth
about, ELI should invent some. But
I 'm afraid that boy hasn't got the
right instinct. J.

FITZ-IMOODLE'S OTTER HOUNDS.
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE HOLE OF AN OTTER, AND PROCEEDED TO STIR IT UP WITH A STICK; BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A
WASPS' NEST!
REJOICINGS IN PODDLETON-ON-SLOSH.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,—No notice as yet
having been taken in the public press
of the important rejoicings which took
place in the old ancient town of Poddle-
ton-on-Slosh, of which I have already
informed you I have the honour to be
Alderman, with pain and surprise I
now take up my pen again to let you
know about the same, hoping to make
it clear that in the way of patriotic
endeavour Poddleton stands where it
did. The committee of a hundred
and seventy-three, including the town
crier, which I may mention in con-
fidence some folks considered too small,
and grumbled because JONES the lamp-
lighter and JACK HALL who drives
the dust-cart were not included—but
then some people are never satisfied,
and even among the roses of Poddleton
we have our thorns—sat on the Coro-
nation on and off for several months.
For a long time it was debated
whether Mr. Mayor should be crowned
in effigy for his Gracious Majesty, and
there was some feeling about it, as
Mr. Mayor himself would have liked it,
but I felt bound to oppose it, he being
a man I consider unsound on the rates;
and so he was not, after all.
Finally, it was agreed that the
auspicious occasion should be com-
menced by the firing of our cannon,
which came from Sebastopol, by the
volunteer corpse (we had three once,
but, unfortunately, two of them burst
when the blessed news of the relief of
Mafeking arrived), after which the bells
were to ring and the corpse, which is
rather perplexed about its new drill, per-
formed volleys into the air, and all the
householders who had guns fired them
in their back gardens, because it was
not considered safe for anyone not being
military to go too near the cannon.
Afterwards it was decided that the
best way to mark the glorious day
would be to regale the school-children,
and after the regalement to form a
procession through the town with the
Poddleton band and flags, while the
corpse lined the High Street. This we
considered the best form of regalia to
celebrate this regal occasion. The pro-
gramme was carried out to a triumphant
conclusion, culminating in a donkey
race; and on the following day I
superintended the picking up of the
pieces of our cannon, which unfortu-
nately has also burst, and which was
carried out by the corpse in mufty.
Yours respectfully,
JOHN BLOGGSBY, Alderman.

CAMERA NOTES.
[Now that the tourist season is in fall swing, we
feel constrained to follow the majority of our con-
temporaries and give our valued renders some
further photographic advice. We think it neces-
sary to steer as clear of technicalities as possible.]
You should always take at least two
different views upon the same film or
plate. The double or treble exposure,
besides being so economical, will give
the most gratifying and astonishing
results, and you may expect to develop
a series of surprises which will qualify
for the freak column in the Strand
Magazine. What can be more exhilara-
ting, for instance, than to find your
best girl "come out" sitting on the lap
of a total stranger by the silver-printed
sea, or the usual long-suffering family
group reclining, by way of variety, in
a pig-sty, with perhaps an express train
running through, their unmoved midst?
This branch of photography seems full
of tremendous possibilities.
If you keep a baby on the premises
—this is, of course, addressed to pater-
familias and not to the baby-farmer—
photograph it every day, placing the
results in an album and sending copies
to all its relatives. This will especially
remind the godparents of their respon-
sibilities, and keep everybody busy and
happy replying. In the years to come,
it will make the child humble and cure
it of conceit to look through its record
and realise that it once looked like that.
Try to catch the baby crying or cutting
a tooth. What would we now give for
a snapshot of SHAKSPEARE muling in his
nurse's arms, or NAPOLEON being spanked
and sent to bed for pulling the pussy's
tail? Truly, we now live in a favoured
age! You have great opportunities—
don't fail to make use of them. Your
infant may turn out a little gold-mine
to the copyright holder or the future
BARNUM.
The budding and enterprising
amateur should not be afraid of libel
actions. If your sitters' feet emerge as
twenty-five's and their heads the size
of pins, tell them the camera cannot
lie. If they retort with the hackneyed
rejoinder that the greater the truth the
greater the libel, you should learnedly
but pleasantly indicate that the magni-
tude of the pedal extremities is redressed
by the tenuity of the upper regions,
and that you struck an average by
focussing on the middlewaistcoat-button.
Should this explanation not be con-
sidered satisfactory, you can then refer
to your solicitors. Do not use your
camera as a literal weapon of offence
or defence. The tripod-stand, if spiked,
is more serviceable.
Presence of mind is a very desirable
quality in a sun-artist. If you are
attacked by the modern equivalent for
a footpad, snapshot him while he runs
through your pockets. He cannot prove
an alibi in the presence of a double
anastigmat, even if you are carried
home on a focal-plane shutter. You
press the button, and the magistrate's
clerk will do the rest. When drowning,
be sure to remember to bag the final
panorama that you gazed upon; also
that the smallest stop should be used, as
the light on the sea is at least four
times as strong as that on land. Do
not dream of giving a time exposure.
You will probably not have sufficient
leisure, and 1/100 second //64 (be
particular as to this) will quite satisfy
your heirs and assigns that you were
on the spot on the occasion of your
lamented demise. The same remarks
apply to railway collisions, air-ship
accidents, encounters with motor-cars,
and similar emergencies. In a word,
you should forget yourself in your
enthusiasm for the craft and for the
writers of camera paragraphs.
BAD VERSES ON A WORSE
CASE.
[Sir ROOBB PALMES has obtaiaed an injunction
from Mr. Justice SWIJJFBN EADY, forbidding Mr.
ANDEEWS to fish in the Thames from a point above
Maidenhead Bridge to Cookham. The Judge finds
that Sir Jtoor.it hai sin exclusive right to thu
fishery.]
I WISH that I could render calmer
My feeling tow'rds Sir ROGER PALMER.
It makes my very heart-strings quiver
When I adventure on the River
For (think it over at your leisure)
The Thames is for his private pleasure,
And all the fish, whoever took 'em,
Are his, from Maidenhead to Cookham;
Yes! everything that wears a fin is
The purchase of Sir ROGER'S guineas.
The conger eel, the shark and tunny
Are his: he bought them with his
money.
They may be tourists on a visit
(The spot is not unsightly, is it ?)
Or merely temporary lodgers
—It doesn't matter: they 're Sir ROGER'S.
And though his anger never kindles
At ordinary thefts and swindles,
He would not have the least compunc-
tion
In serving me with an injunction
From Mr. Justice SWINFEN EADY,
If I should ever be so greedy
As to attempt to take the fishes
In contravention to his wishes.
A British landlord seldom budges,
Especially when backed by Judges;
But this is not the sort of question
(If I may offer a suggestion)
That I should raise if I desired
To have my character admired.
Such is, at least, the firm and fervent
Conviction of his humble servant,
Whose limping lay the danger teaches
Of fishing in Sir ROGER'S reaches.

WHEN the streets are hot and horrid and the atmosphere
is torrid,
And you mop your weary forehead and your shining
crown,
When the Underground is choking and the workmen all arc
smoking,
Sing hey! the country cottage and the Sussex down.
When the autumn leaves are falling and the northern gales
are brawling,
And the solitude 's appalling in the landscape brown,
When you long to talk to something that is living, e'en a

Sing ho! for Piccadilly and a flat in town.
When the gutters gape expectant of the pinky disinfectant,

When the odour not of roses, but of pigs, assails your noses,
Sing ho! for Piccadilly and a flat in town.

When your cosy Club invites you—when the garden gay

THE RECRUIT'S PROGRESS.
n.
THE childish ridicule with which RUTH (my wife) and
DAISY (my wife's sister) received the news of my proposed
immolation on the altar of patriotism has only strengthened
my determination to join the Volunteers. At the outset I
was not so enamoured of the idea but that a little gentle
dissuasion might have turned me from my purpose. But
ridicule! No! I will show them that even a clever man
may serve his country. I will see this thing through, from
the goose-step to (if necessary) the soldier's grave. I will
dedicate to the cause of England's integrity the intellectual
f'fts which Providence has denied to the mass of mankind,
will observe and criticise and suggest. I will recommend
the improvements which I feel must be necessary to put the
Volunteers on a proper footing. The War Office are said to
be in need of proper men for their Intelligence Department.
They shall have Me.
Let me describe how it was that the design of Volunteer-
ing came to enter my head. Like the discovery of steam
and the invention of window-glass and other epoch-making
incidents in the history of the world, it was more or less of
an accident. A haphazard post-prandial meeting with some
of the members of the smartest Company in London's crack
Corps (should this meet the eye of any Metropolitan Volunteer
he will at once see that it is his Company which I propose to
join), a genial suggestion that I should become one of " Ours,"
a refusal on my part so polite that it was taken for a cordial
assent, and I was already ankle-deep in the Rubicon. To ah1
intents and purposes I had become what, during my time at
Cambridge, in the unchastened days of the Pre-Boer period,
we used to call a Bug-shooter. A day or two later, without
any active intervention on my part, I was proposed, seconded,
screened, elected, attested and kissed—I mean I had kissed
the book. There remained only the doctor.
On receiving notice of my election, I was informed that
on a certain day, at a certain time, an officer would be
present in the Orderly Room to swear me in. In due time
ho arrived, clad in the ordinary black coat of commerce.
Ought I to salute him? On the whole, no. I was still a
free man. Without appearing to notice the omission, he
asked me certain questions as to my age, profession, and so
forth, entered my replies on the official form, and then
caused me to sign a statement to the effect that my answers
were not false. Then a sergeant measured my chest.
Minimum measurement, the printed form said, but the
sergeant told me to puff it out. So I puffed till I was black
in the face, though why, or with what result, I have no
idea. Nothing more to do but see the doctor, said the
officer, as he shook hands and retired, having nobly done his
duty.
Sergeant invites me to come with, him, and sign yet more
papers. At this juncture enter a timid recruit, who,
ignoring sergeant, confides to me that he has been ordered
to call here to see an officer about joining. Is the officer
in? This, hopefully; obviously taking me for very superior
officer. The officer, 1 reply, is out, but no doubt the
sergeant will fetch him. Profuse thanks from the recruit,
still labouring under the awe and misapprehension caused
by my military appearance, even in mufti. This will be a
little difficult to keep up when we are doing the goose-step
together. Still, it is his mistake, not mine.
Now for the doctor. The unmilitary mind might have
expected me to see him, or, rather, that he would see me,
before I had done my swearing in instead of after. But
that's not the way they have in the Army, or at least in this
department of it. First the cart, and then the horse—if
vou can get him. First they solemnly swear you to bear
arms within these realms against all the enemies of His
Gracious MAJESTY, then they send you to the medicine-man
to see if you are fit to bear them. If you are not fit—but I
suppose that never happens. Still, I think the W. 0. might
make a note of it.
Well, I went to the doctor—the Corps man, of course—
with a vivid recollection of DAISY'S unfeeling catalogue of
my various infirmities, and a curious sinking in my stomach.
But the doctor was affability itself. As far as I knew, now,
was I pretty sound? Well, yes, I thought I might say I
was. My sight was very bad; ditto my digestion; ditto
my right knee, sprained at football in the days of long ago,
and since then become the haunt of rheumatic microbes.
Otherwise—but then the doctor had his innings. Could I
count these dots, holding up what I guessed to be a card at
the other end of the room? No, I couldn't. Didn't even
know they were dots, though I was ready to take his word
for it. Could I count them now? No. Now? Not at all,
unless I might hold them in my hand. Could, however,
count them at any distance with my eyeglass. Ah, that
would do. Yes. Lungs, heart—might he listen? He might.
Quite sound. Knee, passable. Digestion no concern of
Government's. Hearing, good.
All these particulars the doctor entered one by one in
official question-sheet. Below them was yet another space
containing this dread question—Fit or Unfit? Unfit, wrote
the doctor. Visions of RUTH and DAISY triumphant rose
before me. How they would chuckle! How they would prate
about the survival of the Unfittest. This must be rectified
at all hazards.
"But I don't see -" I began.
"No, that's just the trouble," said the medicine-man.
"You don't—at least, you can't. But the War Office will.
Oh, it's all right. I 'm bound to say it, you know, because
of your sight. If I didn't, and you plugged anybody in the
back, I should get into trouble. Now it don't matter if you
do. I've told 'em you are unfit." (This was comforting
for me and the doctor at all events.) "But," he continued,
"I'll stick 'Special' on the form." He proceeded to do
so, in red pencil. "Now," he concluded cheerfully, " they '11
take you all right."
"It's very good of you."
"Not at all. Don't thank me. Thank the War Office."

Well, I do thank them, solely on
account of RUTH and DAISY. At the
same time, it occurs to me that poBsibly
other people who can't see may have
been passed as specially unfit. In which
case I might get plugged in the back.
In which case—but, after all, I am a

must face death, well I will face it,

ENGLAND'S PERIL.
(By Colonel Sir H-w-rd V-nc-nt, Author
of "Made in Poland," etc.)
WHEN a thinking man surveys the
commercial horizon of Britain, he is
overcome by the sense of the terrible
catastrophe which is approaching the
glorious Empire on which the sun has
never yet set. Foreign competition
besets us on every side: our onions are
Spanish, our organs American, our
sausages German, our coal-scuttles
Japanned, our caudles Roman, our
darkness Egyptian, our delight Turkish,
and our very courage Dutch. The
British infant is aroused from his
peaceful slumbers in a Norwegian
cradle by an American alarm clock.
He clutches his German rattle, and
absorbs Swiss milk from a Belgian
feeding-bottle. See him at a more
mature age standing before a German
master, who instructs him by writing
abstruse questions from a book (bound
in Morocco), with French chalk on a
blackboard made from Russian deal.
See him even as a schoolboy chastised
with a Malacca cane for taking French
leave. View him in the midst of the
stern business of life—playing ping-
pong with a Bavarian racquet, a Saxon
ball, and a Bohemian net. Then, in the
last sad scene of all, when, embalmed by
an American undertaker, he sinks in a
coffin made from pine "hewn on
Norwegian hills," to his final resting-
place in English turf at last.
But a truce to mere generalities; let
us take a particular instance, and reso-
lutely examine one of England's decay-
ing trades. A century since, a Govern-
ment report informs us that there were
in Great Britain no fewer than 10,000
beadles. We ask how many are there
to-day? A strict investigation discloses
the appalling fact that only twenty-four
beadles remain—all in the city of
London. Small wonder if in these
latter days England has become
womanish and hysterical. She has lost
the steadying influence of her beadles.
If a thoughtful Englishman wishes to
become a beadle, there is no institution
in which he can receive the necessary
training. He might learn the right
incivility; but the dignity—the pom-

"OVER-HAIRED."

Customer (preparing for a holiday in London). "I WANT YOU TO BE EXTKA PARTICULAR
TO-DAY, SAM. THIS is MY CORONATION 'CUT,' YOU KNOW!"

posity—can only be acquired by conti-
nental experience. Unless the sugges-
tion of the British Empire Trade
League be adopted that a tax of £10
per stone be levied on imported beadles
(with a rebate of fifty per cent, on
colonial beadles), English beadledom
will be extinct. Ay! the time is not
so far off! For where is the true
specimen of the genuine British beadle
now, at this present moment, to be
found—the real cock'd-hatted, with
scarlet and blue cloth, gold-lace trim-
ming, knee breeches, white stockings,
and shoes with buckles, where is he?
Remember, thoughtful reader, that
when England defied a continent in
arms, when our National Debt reached
its loftiest and most glorious pinnacle,
when the price of corn was highest,
then English beadles were most nu-
merous. Remember this, and let your
watchword be, "Protect the British
Beadle!"

A WEEKLY re-
view remarks
that, "owing to
the number of
volumes held over
on account of the
war, a perfect
torrent of books
seems likely to
descend upon us
in the early au-
tumn." Alarmed
by this intelli-
gence, Mr. Punch
set his Literary
Meteorologist to
work, who has
sent in the follow-
ing report:—
1. SCOTLAND. A
rather unsettled
type of atmos-
pheric conditions
prevails here, pressure being very un-
equally distributed. It is strongest at
present in the Crossland district, where
it threatens to be applied with con-
siderable force in a southerly direction,
accompanied with a high temperature

Drumtochty, and at Thrums
the Barrieometer is falling
somewhat.
2. ENGLAND, N.W. Fairly
settled weather may be antici-
pated here. Some threatening
symptoms are manifest in the
Isle of Man, but as yet they
liave not taken definite shape.
A well-marked area of dis-
turbance, due to minor poets,
is noticeable in the Lake
District, but probably it will
be purely local in its
effects.
3. ENGLAND, MIDLANDS. At
Stratford-on-Avon an earth-
quake seems imminent. It
has been preceded already by
repeated squalls. Sir THEO-
DORE MARTIN, who is pecu-
liarly well acquainted with
the atmospheric vagaries of
this district, has advised the
inhabitants to fly for their
lives.
4. ENGLAND, 8.W. A Q-
shaped impression has been
observed advancing rapidly
from Cornwall, but otherwise
there is every prospect of
fine weather. Mr. BAHINQ-
GOULD reports that the
climatic conditions promise
ping up,
lepression
fairly well for the harvest season. The
crop, he adds, will be lighter than in
some years, but, given a fine September,
he hopes to produce five books a week
for the next few months. The forecast
for the whole of Devon is :—Fair gene-
rally, rather boisterous airs round the
Missingwill district.
5. ENGLAND, S.E. (LONDON AND
long-continued frost
CHANNEL). • The
conditions are so
complex here that
it is impossible to
prepare a detailed
forecast.
The spanking-
breeze prevailing
recently around
the Putney dis-
trict seems to
have spent its
force, and no re-
ports of serious
damage have been
received. Several
storm-signals and
a Union Jack arc
said to be flying
at . Eottingdean.
In London the
season is unusu-
ally forward, and
some of the pub-
lishers express
the hope that the

On the other hand, literary aspirants
report that the mean average tempe-
rature in several editorial offices where
they have taken observations is five
degrees below zero, which is, they add,
more than average mean. And for

DE GUSTIBUS .
I AM an unadventurous man,
And always go upon the plan
Of shunning danger where I can.
And so I fail to understand
Why every year a stalwart band
Of tourists go to Switzerland,
And spend their time for several weeks,
With quaking hearts and pallid cheeks,
Scaling abrupt and windy peaks.
In fact, I 'm old enough to find
Climbing of almost any kind
Is very little to my mind.
A mountain summit white with snow
Is an attractive sight, I know,
But why not see it from bdoic?
Why leave the hospitable plain
And scale Mont 1 (lane with toil and pain
Merely to scramble down again?
Some men pretend they think it bliss
To clamber up a precipice
Or dangle over an abyss,
To crawl along a mountain side,
Supported by a rope that's tied
—Not too securely—to a guide;
But such pretences, it is clear,
In the aspiring mountaineer
Are usually insincere.
And many a climber, I '11 be bound,
Whom scarped and icy crags surround,
Wishes himself on level ground.
So I, for one, do not propose
To cool my comfortable toes
In regions of perpetual snows,
As long as I can take my ease,
Fanned by a soothing southern breeze,
Under the shade of English trees.
And anyone who leaves my share
Of English fields and English air
May take the Alps for aught I care!
CHAEIVARIA.
GREAT excitement was caused all over
England last week by the arrival of
some sunshine. It was said to be due
to some strong remarks on the subject
of the weather in one of our leading
halfpenny papers.
The repeated inclemency of the season
is responsible for the revival and fresh
application of that excellent omnibus
story, so popular in June, of the zealous
Parsee sun-worshipper who had come
over to England for "a bit of a rest"
from his habitual devotions. One of
the most spirited of our contemporaries
has just published it, in the third month
of its career, as a consolation for the
rains of August, and has very ingeni-

ously brought it up to date by applying
it to a member of the SHAH'S suite.
The skull of a man 35,000 years old
has, I read, been unearthed in Kansas.
The Naval Review was witnessed by
the whole of the Lords of the Admiralty.
They expressed themselves as delighted
with the spectacle, and had no idea we
had such a number of ships.
A new system of physical culture has
been devised by the Board of Education
for school-children. It includes simple
drills with broom-sticks. Whether this
will lead to a recrudescence of husband-
beating time alone will show.
Someone has pointed out that the
average Englishman does not look well
in a Panama, as he lacks the requisite
devil-may-care attitude. This has led
an enterprising Professor of Deport-
ment in the North of London to hang
out the following sign: — "Reckless
Attitudes Taught.
A common mistake in oiir newspapers,
in describing a motor-car breakdown, is
to refer to the professional driver as
the "chaff eur1." It should of course be
1' chauffeur.'' The '' chaffeurs '' are the
bystanders who witness the accident.
The SHAH, at the Marlborough House
Reception, wore jewels worth £750,000,
and was closely guarded by detectives
in case he should be stolen.

LA BENEDICTINE.
THE Normandy coast is a pleasant coast,
For never, I know, could sapphire boast
A blue more clear than the sea boasts there
When the winds are hushed and the sky is fair,
And, tricked like a girl whose smile enhances
The glow of her eyes, a ripple dances,
Whispering, murmuring, lulling, cooing,
Withdrawing awhile and again pursuing,
And striving still with a laugh to reach
Over the rocks to the pebbly beach.
And up and up from the grey old strand,
Green, fresh, beautiful folds of land,
Dotted with houses, thatched or slated,
Coil to the top till their sides are mated
In a shimmering glory of cornfields spread,
Like a cover laid on a royal bed,
With the impudent poppies to speckle and prank them,
And the green, cool patches of trees to flank them.
On either hand of the coombes you '11 see
Ramparts of chalk that defy the sea.
Sheer, since the march of time began,
Is the cliff, and not to be climbed by man.
He must hate his life who would strive to win it,
Though he glowed for the toil with his whole soul in it—
Climbing warily, straining, gasping,
His foot in a cleft, and his body rasping,
His hand on the grip for a flint to hitch to,
And his bruised knee set in a shallow niche, too,
He might rise for a hundred feet or so,
And still have double the height to go.
And so he might pause on a narrow ledge of it,
And strain his eyes for the topmost edge of it,
And rise again to the task that drew him—
Till the torn hands loosed, and the sheer cliff threw him.
And Fecamp town is a pleasant town:—
If you come by land, as you first look down
From the winding road and so catch sight of it,
You may think it gloomy and make too light of it;
For there 's not much colour and hardly a spark in it
But its sombre slate-roofs deaden and darken it,
Making it look like a dead survival
Of days when it shone without a rival;
When the trumpet called to its heights and valleys
To gather their hosts and man their galleys,
With their lances flashing, their standards flaunting,
And their morioned lords all strutting and vaunting
How, with the fierce bold men that ringed 'em,
They could shatter a throne or set up a kingdom.
But Fecamp 's changed and it' s quiet and old,
And the blood in its veins runs thin and cold;
And very sedate and grey—it's there
That I met my friend—is the old Place Thiers.
A fine old fellow he was and stout,
Amply bellied and jutting out;
French in the hands (it's the sort of a trick you '11 hate
If you 're British and bluff) that he used to gesticulate;
French in his eyes and their twinkling shrewdness,
French in his bow and his lack of rudeness;
French in his hair, in his smiling lips,
French, in fact, to his finger tips.
Not a limb of the feDow was frail or slender,
And, oh, but his eye was brown and tender,
Clear as a lake undisturbed by a tiny wave,
And his skin had been browned by the sun and the
briny wave.
And, lo, on his waistcoat, jingling-jangling
With its bundle of seals, a chain hung dangling;
And one of them bore, cut deep in the gem on it,
The mystical letters D, 0 and an M on it.
And I said to myself as he bowed, "What a privilege
To be bowed to and talked to by him; 'tis a civil edge
I '11 keep on my tongue and talk back with sobriety,
For I see by his air that he 's used to Society."
Then he shook my hand, and at once he bound me
In meshes of silk that he threw around me,
Meshes spun from his mouth and eyes;
And, trammelled thus, but without surprise,
I felt unfettered and unimpeded,
As though they were just the one thing needed
With their promise of laughter and joy and of fun for me,
These meshes the cheery old Frenchman spun for me.
& o o e *
It didn't last long, our interview,
But he told me many things rare and true
In the old Place Thiers on a summer's day
Before with a bow he slipped away;
It didn't last long, and that's my sorrow,
But perhaps—who knows ?—we may meet to-morrow,
And maybe he '11 bind me, that stout French spinner,
As he bound me before, at lunch or at dinner.

OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
IN The Virginian (MACMILLAN) Mr. OWEN WISTER contri-
butes something fresh to the ever-widening stream of books.
For such a benefactor there remains share of the blessing
reserved for him who makes two blades of grass grow in
place of one. It is true there is about the book reminis-
cence of the work of the man who "was the first that ever
burst " on the unplumbed sea of character and adventure in
which the early settlers in California disported themselves.
But Mr. WISTEE is no slavish imitator of BRETT HARTE. He
goes to the ranche instead of the goldfields, and in the cow-
puncher finds a man as savage in outward manner, as
tender at heart, as humorous, as reckless as the early
Californian, and withal of a higher standard. The scene is
pitched in Wyoming, which, thirty years ago, was as wild as
Virginia under Georgian rule; a scantier population with
equally primitive joys and dangers in the way of living. In
his hero, Mr. WISTER portrays one of Nature's noblemen, higL-
minded, pure-hearted, gentle, brave, and capable. By odd
chance my Baronite knows him—him or his twin spirit and
brother. He met him on an Atlantic steamer twenty-five
years ago, homeward bound to his ranche, having seen and
marvelled at the civilisation of England. Tall, handsome,
well-dressed, with musical voice and languorous drawl he,
once a cow-boy, then an almost millionaire ranche-owner,
might have sat for the portrait of Tlie, Virginian. To com-
plete the similitude, he was devotedly, sublimely, in love
with a little school-marm settled in the wilds with mission
to teach the cow-boys and any stray children that were
around. If this.chance acquaintance was not the Virginian,
it is well to know the world possessed two such men. The
story is breezy with life and colour, love-making, and, upon
occasion, straight shooting. After all these centuries, it was
left to The Virginian to say something new of Queen
ELIZABETH. Reading Kenilworth, which the school-marm
had lent him, he looked up, and with his gentle drawl
observed, "Queen ELIZABETH would have played a mighty
pow'ful game of poker." The remark throws a flood of
light from a quite new direction on the character of
ELIZABETH TUDOR. THE BARON DE B.-W.

THE GREAT SOCIETY TRUST.
AN influential Syndicate of financiers
in New York is about to form a Trust
(to be run as a money-making venture)
with the purpose-
of invading
English Smart
Society. The ob-
ject of the pro-
moters is to secure
all the entries into
the Upper Circles
for their clientele.
They will thus be
in a position to
dictate their terms
to all wealthy
social aspirants.
The Trust has
already secured
the services of one
Duchess, two
Earls, and several
Leaders of So-
ciety. The pro-
moters, although
recognising that
they will have to
face considerable
competition in
this line of busi-
ness, are confident
that they will be
able to secure a
controlling inter-
est in all con-
cerns of the kind
on this side of the
Atlantic, for their
enormous capital
will ensure that
competitors will
find it impossible
to remain outside
the Combine, and
will be forced
either to join or
go to the wall.
There will be a
preferential tariff
for all American-
born citizens, and
special terms for
Colonial Dames.
The Trust will
provide invita-
tions to dinners,
dances, At Homes,
and country-house
parties for their
clients, and will also include an Instruc-
tionary Department and a Matrimonial
Bureau.
The Instructionary Department will
be superintended by the daughter of a
Marquess, with a competent staff of
refined persons of both sexes conversant
with the manners of Smart Society.
Special attention will be paid to English
accent, intonation of the voice, and
male attire.
The Matrimonial Bureau will be run

THE RECRUIT'S PROGRESS.
in.
IN due course I presented
my " special" medical certifi-
cate at the orderly-room of
the corps, and was ushered
into the Adjutant's presence.
In a way it was worse than
I had feared. For, to our
mutual confusion, we dis-
covered that we were already
acquainted. He had, in fact,
been one of my fags at school
in the far-off days of the Vic-
torian era.
"What years it is!" said
he.
"Centuries," I agreed, and
wondered whether he remem-
bered the episode of the
razor and the strop. The
razor was mine—my first; he
used it for cutting bread-and-
butter. The strop was also
mine: I used it instead of a
cane. And now he was my
superior officer!
"You're not a bit changed,"
I remarked nervously, " bar
the strop—the moustache, I
mean."
"I see," said he, "that you still shave yours. I should
have known you anywhere. Of course your—ah—forehead
is higher, and you 're rather—er—broader. But we '11 soon
change this last. Want to do a drill to-day?"
Did I want to do a drill—when my whole nature recoiled

"Thanks so much,"
lent affectation of cheerfulness. "I should like to. Very
much."
"Right," said the Adjutant. "We '11 go up to the Drill-
hall then. It won't be as bad as you think."
Nor indeed was it. For, having introduced me to a drill
sergeant, he had the decency to retire without watching my
evolutions, and I didn't so much mind the rest of the world.
The sergeant drew me up in front of him, and proceeded to
put me through the shuffling gymnasium-bred turnings
which are now the vogue. Two or three other recruits
dropped in, put on belts and bayonets, and dropped out
again, carrying rifles: they were in a sufficiently advanced
state to manoeuvre in the open air, coram publieo.
Then came other men, some of them almost, as middle-
aged as myself—the veterans of the corps. "Learning sig-
nalling," the sergeant told me at my first stand-easy.
When they were not engaged in wagging flags and
recording their impressions of other flag-waggers in their
note-books, they lit cigarettes and watched my performances
with critical but kindly eyes.
Frock-coated, top-hatted, eye-glassed, middle-aged, white-
spatted and portly-vested, I turned right and left, stood at
ease by numbers (there's indignity for you !), saluted, quick-
marched up and down and all round my sergeant, turning,
wheeling, inclining, chest out and shoulder up, for a good
hour, with such brief intervals for rest as my perspiring
face and panting bosom wrung from the compassion of my
instructor. And not one of
the signallers smiled — not
once — when I was looking.
They had been there, I know:
they too, were once raw ma-
terial, and were only seeing
me as others had seen them.
After that I put in drills
when I could. Sometimes
other recruits turned up — on
red-letter days enough of
them to assist me in the
performance of the evolution
known as forming fours. The
fact that the more youthful
address me as "Sir" is a
tribute, I think, not so much
to my advancing years, as
to the ease with which I
have mastered the theory as
well as the practice of the
art in about Half the number
of drills which a remorseless
Government exacts from the
unwilling victims of its re-
cruiting-system.
"
On a piercing evening to-
wards the latter end of July,
an apparently harmless in-
dividual might have been
observed to descend from a
hansom which he had caused to stop some doors short of
the house into which he eventually disappeared, carrying
a large brown-paper parcel and a mysterious-looking canvas
bag. Casting a furtive glance over his shoulder, he cautiously
inserted a key into the door of one of the most respectable-
looking houses in the street, and quietly let himself in, with
difficulty barring the door against the icy blast. Once inside
the dimly-lit hall, he listened anxiously for any signs of life,
and then stole noiselessly up the narrow stair till he arrived
at a door which he opened and shut with the same precau-
tions. Then he drew from the paper parcel a coarse grey
suit, made of cloth so thick that when, after hurriedly
divesting himself of his outer garments, he turned to assume
his disguise, it gave him a momentary shock to find the
trousers, which he had carefully unfolded and straightened,
standing up by themselves in the middle of the floor.
Having with some difficulty fastened the various buttons of
his suit by the aid of a button-hook, he placed a small cap,
made of the same material, on his head, and proceeded to
climb on to a chair, which he placed in such a position that by
standing upon it he could command a view of his whole figure
reflected in the glass above the chimney-piece. Suddenly
Suddenly the door opened, and in walked my wife and
her sister. I am aware that no one looks his best when
he is caught standing on a chair in order to admire himself
in a looking-glass—least of all when the clothes that he is
surveying are a Melton frock and trousers as provided for
the use of the auxiliary forces. But I fail to see why my
appearance should have excited the indecent ridicule to
which I was subjected by my female relatives. In fact,
for the honour of the regiment, I must draw a veil over the
ribald remarks, at the expense of my figure and my vanity,
which I had to face. I merely mention the episode to show
that a Volunteer must expect no honour in his own house.
After this it will be comparatively easy to face even the rude
gamin of our crowded streets when I first have occasion to
walk abroad in my brand-new and exceedingly uncomfortable
uniform.

PUNCH,. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GERMAN CUSTOM HOUSE.
THE Germans are odd people, as
different from other people as they can
be. Look, for instance, at their clothes.
What other nation would brave the
light of day in green hygienic all-wool
garments, designed by a doctor, with
no cut about them at all? Look, again,
at their manners. As a nation they are
rude to everyone, and their statesmen
make speeches which are simply amaz-
ing. But they are not more .amazing
than the manners of the German
custom-house officers.
In most countries these men are very
disagreeable. In England, where the
policeman, the porter, the stationmaster,
the post-office clerk, and other officials
are usually good-natured and obliging,
the custom-house officer is frequently
sour and ill-tempered. He may be
tired, but so are the travellers whom he
pesters with his attentions. He may be
bored, but so are they. The German
Zollbeamte, still preserving that differ-
ence of his countrymen from other
people, is a kind, obliging, civil fellow.
However much he may be harassed,
his manners are charming.
It is really quite pleasant to meet
him. His plump, rosy face shows a
genial smile, as though to welcome one
to his country. His uniform is a neat
one. It has, indeed, some green about
it, but it was not designed by a doctor.
He wears a sword; but I am convinced
he would be much too good-natured to
use it, even to strike down a Schmuggler.
He has the kindly manner of a Familien-
vater, and one can easily imagine him
at home, dancing his little GRETCHEN on
his knee, as in any chromolithograph
"printed in Bavaria." It would be
impossible to associate such simple
relaxation with the unfriendly French
douanier, that haughty fonctlonnairc,
or with the unprepossessing brigands
who receive one on the frontiers of Italy
or Spain.
The German army officer, especially
the lieutenant, has an appearance of
insufferable conceit, though there is
probably a gentleman, if you knew him,
inside that great coat with the preposte-
rous square shoulders a yard wide.
The German station-master, in spite of
his beautiful red cap, is a kindly fellow-
creature at heart, and the policeman,
even in Berlin, is polite. But the
German custom-house officer is a model
to the world. What the Americans
think of him, after their own officials,
it would be difficult to discover, for it
is wiser never to mention a custom-house
to people from the land of freedom
across the Atlantic.
TheB other day, going from Paris to
Strassburg, 1 was more than ever sur-
prised by the amiable Germans at the

frontier. The train was packed. I
arrived at the Gare de 1'Est, with what
seemed needless haste, half an hour be-
fore it started. I strolled up to the
ticket inspector, and asked him casually
if the train for Strassburg had come up
to the platform. "Mais depechez-vous,
monsieur," cried he, " il y a deux trains,
et tons les deux sont liondee." And so
they were. The French, ever cautious,
had arrived an hour before the time,
and finding two trains ready, had been
sitting in them ever since. The second
one of the two, in which I was, poured
out this immense crowd at the frontier
station the next morning.
It was six o'clock, or seven o'clock,
according to the time of one country or
the other, but at any rate it was horribly
early. It was raining heavily, it was
loomy, it was cold. However, it was
.ot enough in the baggage-room packed
with people. They were all< out of
temper. This partly arose from the
fact that each unit of the crowd carried
angular packages with umbrellas and
sticks projecting from them. Everyone
was banged, and prodded, and trampled
on, and had the handle of an umbrella
entangled in his collar, or the sharp end
of a stick going up his sleeve. The
sturdiest passengers, who managed to
keep their packages horizontal, were
turned round and round like teetotums
in the struggling mass. All the women
from the third class held cardboard band-
boxes of which the remnants strewed
the floor. The custom-house officers
had already encountered one such
crowd. It is true they stood in a
space apart, but that space was just
a chaos of luggage, hauled in and
thrown down amongst them. Yet even
amidst this hubbub they were pleasant
and polite.
If only the foreign affairs of Germany
were managed by her custom-house
officers, how much she would be liked
by everyone!

I WANDERED on an unknown tract,
A ghostly, disembodied sprite;
Yet I rejoiced—I was, in fact,
A " phantom of delight."
Not Yarrow's braes entranced my eye,
I noticed no familiar sign;
But rolling tilths untempered by
The lesser celadine.
I saw no pkasant Highland plot,
Nor LUCY tripping o'er the lea,
But in the distance, out of shot,
The springbok bounded free.
I spied the natives, full as beeves,
Prostrate, each Kaffir, by his cot,
Or else they sat beside their sheaves,
Talking in Hottentot.
Within my bosom so serene
Unearthly courage seemed to spring;
I think that I should not have been
Surprised at any thing.
At length I neared a noisy town
Where merchandise was sold and
bought,
And marked a maid in russet gown
Immersed in anxious thought.
She had a strange outlandish air
That made my heart almost to melt,
She looked so pensive sitting there
Upon a piece of veld.
Unwont to pass such cases by,
"Dear Girl," I said, "come tell me
now
What may those wrinkles mean that I
Detect upon your brow?
"Some silent grief your spirit gnaws;
Come, all your childish pain rehearse;
Can indigestion be the cause,
Or have you lost your nurse?
"Nay, do not fear me, pretty lamb,
Or take immediately to flight;
Beneath my ghostly garb I am
A phantom of delight."
"You ask me what is in my head,
But if to you it's all the same
I will not tell," JOHANNA said
(JOHANNA was her name).
"But if you have a pain inside,
Larger than you can well endure,
Tell me the symptoms," I replied,
"I might suggest a cure. .
"You give no answer? Say why so."
She looked at me with furtive eye,
And murmured, "Nay, I do not know."
This was a shocking lie.

"The sky is blue, the earth is gay,

More times than I would care to say,
I made tliis same remark.
At length she cried, "It is enough!
Within my head there lurks a clot;
/ can't decide if WORDSWORTH'S stuff
Is poetry or not."
Well might her brain sustain a hitch
In worrying such a problem out;
Poor Girl! it is a point on which
I too have harboured doubt!
===== °' S'
HINTS TO AMATEUR PLAYWRIGHTS.
Of tlie Essence of Drama.—It is not
strictly necessary that you should know
much about this, but as a rough indi-
cation it may be stated that whenever
two or more persons stand (or sit) upon
a platform and talk, and other persons,
whether from motives of ennui, or
charity, or malice, or for copyright
purposes only, go and listen to "them,
the law says it is a stage-play. It does
not follow that anybody else will.
Of the Divers Sorts of Dramatic.
Writing.—Owing to the competition
nowadays of the variety entertainment
you will do well to treat these as
practically amalgamated. For example,
start Act I. with an entirely farcical and
impossible marriage, consequent upon
a mistake similar to that of Mr. Pick-
wick about the exact locality of his
room; drop into poetry and pathos in
Act II. (waltz-music "off" throughout
will show that it is poetry and pathos);
introduce for the first time in Act III.
a melodramatic villain, who endeavours
to elope with the heroine (already mar-
ried as above and preternaturally con-
scious of it); and wind up Act IV. with
a skirt dance and a general display of
high spirits, with which the audience;
seeing that the conclusion is at hand,
will probably sympathise. Another
mixture, very popular with serious
people, may be manufactured by raising
the curtain to a hymn tune upon a
number of obviously early Christians,
and, after thus edifying your audience,
cheering them up again with glimpses
of attractive young ladies dressed (to a
moderate extent) as pagans, and con-
tinually in fits of laughter. The per-
formance of this kind of composition is
usually accompanied by earthquakes,
thunder and lightning; but the stage
carpenter will attend to these.
Of Humour.—Much may be accom-
plished in this line by giving your
characters names that are easily punned
upon. Do not forget, however, that
even higher flights of wit than you can
attain by this means will be surpassed
by the simple expedient of withdrawing
a chair from behind a gentleman about
to sit down upon it. And this' only
requires a stage-direction.
Of Dialogue.—Speeches of more than
half a page, though useful for clearing
up obscurities, are generally deficient
in the qualities of repartee. After
exclaiming, "Oh, I am slain!" or
words to that effect, no character should
be given a soliloquy taking more than
five minutes in recitation.
Of the Censorship.—This need not lie
feared unless you are unduly serious.
Lady GODIVA, for instance, will be all
right for a ball where the dress is left
to the fancy, but you must not envelop
her in problems.
A FRIENDLY CHAT.
[The GERMAN EMPEROR, who went on board
M. MENIEB'B >acht in Norwegian water* hitch,
astonished everyone by his knowledge and powcn
of conversation. Extracts from th« log-book of
the venal have just been published. "He a»oendfd
to the upper deck, and then engaged us all in a
long conversation on a thousand thing* . . . while
we were all s'undinr, for the EMPEHOK never sit«
in the presence of ladies." The following teems
to be M. HENIER'S private account of the visit, j
THE KAISER came, the KAISER talked,
The KAISER stood about or walked;
He would not sit upon a chair,
Because we had some ladies there;
He seemed, with all his iron will,
Incapable of keeping still.
He talked about the Balkan States,
Of RHODES'S influence on Greats,
Of pictures, photographs, and busts,
The Czar of RUSSIA and the Trusts—
The plays of MARLOWE and of GREENE,
The future of the submarine,
Of women's rights, of motor-fans,
Of bicycles and Hooligans,
Of graduated income tax,
And horizontal parallax.
He talked about the House of Keys;
He made a pun in Siamese;
He said some really striking things
About the early Hittite kings;
Some views on Carthage he advanced;
He showed us how the Bacchce danced,
And from his own translation proved
'Twas beer, not wine, that OMAR loved.
My brain will treasure till it rots
His theory of solar spots;
Nor shall I easily forget
His ode in Turkish to DE WET,
His singing of The Minstrel Hoy,
His water-colour sketch of Troy,
His knowledge of the tribes of Gaul,
His criticisms on Saint Paul,
His sympathy with Cuba's wrongs.
His passion for Provencal songs ;—
All these, and more, I trust I may
Remember to my dying day.
At last he ceased. I saw him go,
Then, worn to death, I went below.

Quel savant! et quel Empereur!

Where forms each verdant, velvet shore
A casket worthy of its gems—

And listen to the music made

Conies from afar upon the hush
The weir's sad, ceaseless monotone;
At vespers, hark! the thankful thrush,

And, in the deep, cool, gated lock,

And bottle-laden fore and aft,

that the train that you meant to catch
goes in about ten sections, of which of

Colonel. Haven't done this sort of thing

I call it. "Explain the geographical
and strategical importance of Dunkirk."
Where on earth is Dunkirk?
Major. Somewhere in the Hebrides,
isn't it? Sort of idea there's good
sea-trout fishing there in the autumn.
What does JONES say?
Colonel. He says it's a promontory in
Fifeshire, famous on account of WILLIAM
WALLACE, and that's all. I should have
said it was in Ireland. There are a good
many places with Scotch-sounding names
there. I wish we had an atlas.
Major (shrewdly). Well, whatever it
is, JONES doesn't say anything about its
strategical or geographical importance.
His answer isn't geography at all, it's
history, so we can't mark him for it.
Colonel. Oh, it's partly geography;
he says it's in Fifeshire, and it 'e
geographically important to know where
a place is. Anyhow, he knows as much
as we do. Give him a couple, poor
devil. (Goes on with paper.) "Explain
the terms equator, pole, latitude, zone."
JONES says, "The equator is the middle,
and the poles are the ends, of the
earth." (Hesitates.)
Major (confident). That's all right.
Colonel (doubtful). I don't know; it
doesn't sound right somehow. (Ponders

unconscious but hearty plagiarism), Oh,

MR. PUNCH'S SKETCHY INTERVIEWS.
HE.—MR. CHAMBERLAIN.
No one who is merely acquainted
•with Mr. CHAMBERLAIN as a political
gladiator can form any notion of his
quiet personal charm. His bijou resi-
dence at Highbury simply radiates
sunshine — indeed, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
might be safely styled the Roi aoleil of
latter-day Imperialism. On the occa-
sion of our recent visit the famous
statesman was hard at work on his new
treatise on the Preferential Calculus,
hut with characteristic bonhomie he
dismissed his Secretary and plunged
into general conversation. Although it
was only 11 A.M. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S
slim figure was encased in a faultless
grey frock-coat, with trousers to match,
patent leather boots and congress
gaiters completing a singularly en-
gaging tout ensemble.
"Sit down, won't you," cheerily
cried the great Imperialist in his most
flute-like tones, "but mind that stuffed
ostrich—it was a present from King
LEWANIKA. The Moa in the glass case
was given me by SEDDON. Wonderful

"A singularly engaging tout mtemile."
"Howdo you find time to learn them
all? " we queried.
"Ah, you see, I take no exercise. I
lead an entirely Seddon-Tory existence
now. I am, however, photographed a
good deal. You will remember that
famous snapshot of me at Blenheim
during the peroration of my speech at
the great Unionist meeting. And then
I read widely. Great Expectations was
an early favourite of mine. My eldest
son is named after Miss AUSTEN, and I
know COLLINS' 'Ode on the Passions'
almost by heart.'' Here Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
in an exquisite falsetto, began to hum,
"Rosabacca, Roeabacca,
Tria jugera cum vacca."

"I take no exercise: I lead a Seddon-Tory life."
"Have you other pursuits?" we
asked.
"I used to be fond of turning, but I
do it less now."
"You are interested in the Drama,
too? " we timidly suggested.

"I was once devoted to private theatricals."
"Deeply," responded the illustrious
Minister, "though I seldom find time
to visit the theatre nowadays. You see,
our show at St. Stephen's is always at
the same hour. I was once devoted to
private theatricals, and even now ROWTON
—no mean judge—thinks my imitations
of DEVONSHIRE and GORST quite as good
as Miss CISSY Lorrue's."
"And then you are interested in
horticulture, too?"
"Ah, yes. Flowers have always been
a perfect inspiration to me. And not
merely the rarer, the more recondite
plants, but every blooming thing delights
me. So different from ARTHUR BALFOUR,
to whom the most beautiful shrub is
simply a hazard at golf, nothing more."
"Then you have not succumbed to the
fascinations of the popular pastime?"
"No, I don't play golf; but ARTHUR
BALFOUR has presented me with a long
'spoon.'" At this point we rose.
"Will you have an orchid or a whisky
and soda?" were the last kind words
of our charming host.

"I am, in fact, quite an authority on weeds."

WHY have we been called together?
Why should we be talking shop,

And the guns go pop?
What's the reason? What's the reason?
Is it war, or is it treason
Makes us spoil the salmon season
And our shooting drop?
First Peer. Lo, here comes he whose wisdom regulates
The fiery ardour of our long debates.
Behold his brow, with sorrow clouded o'er—
Hush, hush! he speaks, the Lord High Chancellor.
L. H. C. A few short weeks ago, or ere
The coy, seductive grouse made
This gilded hall a desert bare
We lost, alas, our house-maid.
The floor was all unswept, the dust
My woolsack 'gan to smother;
Our Abigail was gone. I must,
I felt, procure another.
I set to work, and with a host
Of registries I flirted,
And daily in the Morning Post
Advertisements inserted.
Maids filled the Lobby, row on row,
Of endless shades and tinges,
But some looked fast and some looked slow,
And others sported fringes.
At length a maid of likely mien
I came on—sober, willing,
No fringe, no followers, and clean
As newly-minted shilling.
I next about her character
Enquired in all directions,
And all agreed in painting her
A bundle of perfections.
My cares were o'er. I smiled a smile—
But hear the sequel tragic:
The housemaid's furniture meanwhile
Had vanished as by magic.
The Board of Works had stolen chair,
Bed, towel-horse and table,
And left our housemaid's room as bare
As any gee-gee's stable.
Half-Chorus A. Wo! Wo! Are we fallen so low
That we cannot provide for our Abigail? No!
Surely by some means or other we 're able
To give her a towel-horse, chair, bed and table.
Half-Chorus B. We 've marked with regret how the National
Debt
Has grown, and is likely to grow bigger yet,
And we rather suspect that a plot has been laid
To make us dispense with our excellent maid.

As she gazes all a-weary
Into Paradise, poor Peri,
Where she may not be.

We are resolved to do or die.
All. We are!
First Peer. Whatever risk we run, whatever ill
May threaten, we will save our maid.
All. We will!
First Peer. Whatever tempests round about us brew,
We stand beside our Peri still.
All. We do!

By our coronets and charters,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ATHLETES AT BOW STREET,
n.
Mr. DOHERTY, although as anxious as
anyone to fire guns at our enemies and
defeat the commercial enterprise of
America, was irresistibly impelled to play
lawn tennis. This was because he was
a twin. The precedent established by
the RENSHAWS, the BADDELEYS, and the
ALLENS placed this beyond dispute. In
fact, it had been seriously proposed to
alter the name of the pastime to Lawn
Twinnis. He wished further to point
out that, frivolous as the game might
be held to be, it was at any rate not to
be confounded with ping-pong.
The Bench, taking the last-mentioned
circumstance into consideration, decided
not to pass sentence of death; and the
prisoner was instead sentenced to be
enrolled in the Rottingdean Rifle Club.

worked so long in oils, he was less
susceptible to the influence of salt water
than an ordinary subject. In addition
to which he had taken the extra precau-
tion of being varnished all over. Finally
he indignantly denied that he had any
intention of leaving the country.
In that case his route would have
been not across the Channel, but the
Atlantic.
Mr. A. C. SWINBURNE, President of the
Putney Porpoises, who entered the box
with a free trudgeon stroke, also gave
evidence in the prisoner's behalf. He
said that since LEAKDER swam the
Hellespont, no more superlative or
incomparable feat than that ol
Mr. HOLBEIN had illumined and en-
lightened an ener-
MR. H. L. DOHEETY was charged with
playing Lawn Tennis to the detriment
of Imperial efficiency and Britain's
commercial supremacy. •
Mr. ALFRED HARMSWORTH, in an im-
passioned speech for the prosecution,
said that Mr. DOHERTY had been gifted
with a splendid constitution and a fine
Irish name, instead of which he had
gone about for years patting balls over
a net. Not even the publication of
Mr. KIPLING'S poem of The Islanders
had induced Mr. DOHERTY to desist from
his preposterous pastime, which, though
unobjectionable as a recreation for girls'
schools or underworked curates, was
totally unworthy
of the scion of
a hundred kings.
How could a
player of lawn
tennis do any-
thing seriously to
embarrass Mr.
PIERPONT MORGAN
or the controllers
of the Boot Com-
bine?
DIAVOLO, who
apologised for
appearing in

padded suit, as
lie had to perform
his engagement
of "looping the
lo'ops" in the
course of the next
hour, gave evi-
dence in support
of counsel's open-
ing statement. It
was impossible to
be seriously in-
jured while playing lawn tennis.
Mr. EDDIE GIFFORD, who dives from
the roof of the Hippodrome on a bicycle,
corroborated. Only such feats, he
maintained, can really federate the
world.
Mr. EUSTACE H. MILES, amateur cham-
pion of racquets and tennis, stated that
he did not think Mr. DOHERTY'S position
was incompatible with the fulfilment of
the duties of a good citizen. He (Mr.

Mr. H. F. LAWFORD, K.C., who ap-
red for the defence, contended that
He left the court in the custody of Mr.
KIPLING and Air. HARMSWORTH.
MONTAGU HOLBEIN, described as an
Old Master, and giving an address at
the National Gallery, was charged with
endeavouring to escape from the country
by sea.
The prisoner, who had been picked
up in mid-channel and carefully
restored, was, to suit his peculiar
idiosyncrasy, accommodated with a seat
in the well of the court.
Sir EDWARD POYNTER, R.A., who was
the chief witness for the prosecution,
described the circumstances in which
HOLBEIN had disappeared. Salt water,
he explained, had a most disastrous
effect on the complexion of Old Masters,
and he feared that HOLBEIN'S value was
permanently depreciated.

Camorrists) who dare not return home
to their aggrieved and sorrowing rela-
tives. //, however, your group-views
are successful—and subjects will fly
into focus sometimes—I hope I have
sufficiently indicated the pleasantly
husy future which is in store for you.
And you will never need to wash, for
you will live in one continued toning-
and-fixing bath.
There are various ways of construct-
ing an impromptu dark room, when you
are overtaken with a desire to develop
your treasured records in the daytime.
One method is to get under the bed,
having pinned dressing-gowns and
other light-tight draperies all round it.
You must be careful not to be mistaken
for a prospective burglar. A thought-
less maidservant may raise the hangings
and the alarm together, and irretrieva-
ble damage will be done. Another way
is to occupy your wife's wardrobe',
having previously removed and inven-
toried the contents, that is, assuming
that you have some wife, that she has a
wardrobe, and that the latter has con-
tents (though this is generally denied).
Do not enter a strange lady's wardrobe.
This is almost invariably resented, and
developments of an embarrassing kind
ensue. A third solution of the diffi-
culty is to take refuge in the coal-hole,
where this is available. A word of
caution must here be offered: be
careful not to use pieces of Wallsend
under the impression that they are
"hypo."
Cameras can be made quite cheaply
nowadays. A penny one will be shortly
put on the market, but I do not think
1 am infringing any patent in divulg-
ing the secret of its manufacture. First
obtain, by one of the three familiar
processes, an old cigar-box. Black it
over with Day-and-Martin, and bore a
large hole in one side. Fit into this
the bottom of a soda-water bottle, or
the "kick" of any second-hand Veuve
Clicquot that you may see lying about.
This serves for the lens, and will give
astonishing definition. For the cap and
shutter combined you may use the
stopper of a pickle-jar, as this has a
quite effective spring. I leave it to
your ingenuity to devise how it should
be fixed. Do not complicate your
machine with intricate contrivances for
regulating speed and focus. Go in for
broad artistic effects. A slit or two at
the back of the box will be required for
the insertion of plates, and there you
are. Excellent photos of a London fog
or the inside of the Tuppenny Tube
(when the lights go out) are guaranteed
by this handy and inexpensive little
instrument.
That ingenious military invention,
the hyposcope, whereby the rifleman
can aim over an obstacle and behind
cover, has lately been adapted to photo-
graphic purposes. The snap-shotter
may now disregard the largest matinee
hat and secure successful views of any
passing procession, or he may bag an
elusive foreign potentate from behind a
brick wall without fear of detection.
In fact, with such facilities for un-
obtrusive and invisible camera-craft, it
will soon be considered the height of
rudeness and vulgarity to be seen
carrying a Kodak. Every well-regulated
sun-artist must provide himself with a
telephotohyppscope and retire over the
nearest skyline when he contemplates
taking a picture, say, of a bathing-
scene or a lovers' interview, or, in short,
any personal incident whatever. The
new appliance has quite revolutionised
photographic etiquette.

CHEAPKIDE.
THE NEW TERROR.
I AM the widow
of a country squire,
and have lived in
peace and comfort
with the whole
neighbourhood for
over forty years.
But within the last
twenty-four hours
a frightful change
has taken place,
and I feel as though
I were surrounded
by raving lunatics,
Gunpowder Plots,
or a French Revo-
lution.
It began yester-
day morning when
I was out driving in
a quiet lane. My
coachman suddenly
reined the horses
back on their
haunches, leaped
from his seat on to
the road, and began waving his hat like a madman. I was
speechless with horror, and was trying to nerve myself to
jump from the carriage and totter home when JOHN climbed
quietly back to his seat and gathered up the reins. But
before starting the horses he turned to the footman and
said with a gloating smile that sent a chill down my back,
"It was the red Devil, with*his long hairy yellow legs!
I 've got him now!"
In the evening I strolled in the park to refresh my nerves
after the shock of the morning. On the muddy brink of
the pond, splashing her hands in the weedy water, knelt
my own maid in
her cap and apron.
It flashed into my
mind that she nml
the coachman had
gone mad with love
of eacli other, and
that the poor girl
was about to drown
herself before my
eves. I would have
shrieked; but my
maid at that
moment rose to her
feet, and, without
noticing me, smiled
the blood-curdling
smile of JOHN the
coaclunan and ran
wildly away.
How I reached
the house I never
knew. As I sank
into my chair I
heard steps in the
hall, and the voice
of my maid, broken
w.ith a sort of
dreadful glee,
"Cook, they were
black, and slimy,

Or, Two Sides of Human Nature.

are
and horrible; I
believe they
wriggling in my
hair!"
I retired that
night more shaken
than I have been
since the loss of my
dear husband.
Next morning,
after a night di-
vided between
hideous dreams of
combats with
maniacs and wak-
ing plans for the
speedy dismissal of
my unfortunate ser-
vants, I sat at my
scarcely tasted
breakfast by the
open French win-
dow leading onto
the terrace walk.
The gardener' s li t tie
son was coming
towards the house,
and had no sooner
reached my window than he dashed his cap on the gravel
path, threw himself down beside it, and in a few moments
(to my intense horror) jumped up with a ghastly childish
edition of that appalling smile. Then he shouted with a
fiendish gladness to his father at work on some distant
border, "I 've got it all right, father; but it's sticking its
claws into my hand! Need I put it in my pocket?"

WB had cleft tlie salt sea bravely, but the wind went out
and died;
And I heard the sails a-flapping as we drifted with the tide;
With the swaying masts above us drawing curves across the
blue,
And the long smooth swell to swing us—and it 'a then I
thought of you!
For the wind it died at evening, and it left us rolling free,
Rolling free and loose and lazy in the hollows of the sea;
And the sea-birds came to mock us :—" Who are these that
lie at rest
In the ocean's easy cradle while we hurry on our quest?"
Then they gathered half a hundred, while we heard their
pass-word ring,
And without a splash or flutter they were off upon the wing;
Fifty cormorants a-scudding in a swift and level flight
Scarce a foot above the surface, till they settled out of sight.
But the wise old gull kept with us, and his flight was never
fast,
But sedate and poised and sober, as he circled round the mast,
As he circled close and closer, and anon went soaring high
With a flash of snowy glory on the azure of the sky.
"Look alive, my men, be ready!"—'twas the captain
singing clear—
"We might drift and get no further if we tried for half a year;
Though the harbour's close and handy, it might just as well
be far,
For we draw twelve feet of water, and it's ten above the
bar."
Then we folded in our pinions, and the masts were stark
and plain,
And away we swung our anchor with a rattle of the chain;
And the night spread out her kirtle, and the stars came
peeping through,
And the shoreward lights were gleaming—and it's then I
thought of you!
For I saw you by the river—it was just a waking dream—
On the grassy banks that fledge it, and we walked beside
the stream;
Oh, it's then I thought and wondered if you spared a
thought for me,
You on land for me at anchor in the hollows of the sea.

SWEETNESS AND STRENGTH.
[Among the more clamorous topics of the holiday season must be reckoned
the important questions which have been lately exercising our contempor-
aries, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon, namely, " Should Women
Work?" and "Should Kissing be Abolished •" The inter-relation of the«e
two problems has not yet been adequately recognised.]
GONE is the giant gooseberry's girth,
And gone the brave sea-serpent's gambols;
Themes that command a rarer mirth
Pursue us on our summer rambles;
To-day we drink new problems in
With apprehensions nicely polished,
And ask Should Women toil and spin 9
Or else, Should Kissing be abolished?
Myself, untaught in chemic terms,
I shrink, from lack of education,
To probe the peril, due to germs,
That lies in casual osculation;
With equal reason I refuse
To treat of economic questions—
But when it comes to moral views,
I teem with luminous suggestions.
Go back in thought to Eden's bowers,
And with Mosaic history grapple;—
You '11 find no talk of working-hours
Till after Era had plucked the apple;
For so the tale, that tells us how
Her form she first began to drape, runs;
And surely kisses sealed her vow
Before she took to stitching aprons.
0 yes, we learned it long ago,
(Prior, indeed, to Girton College),
How half our sweets and bitters flow
From tampering with the Tree of Knowledge;
The need to work, the right to kiss—
We 've caught them from our common mother,
That as the penalty for this,
And one the medicine of the other.
Divorce the two, and take from toil
Its only satisfying guerdon;
Or filch from love its proper foil—•
And life, each way, becomes a burden.
Excess in either art alone
(Consult the Lunacy Commission)
Greatly impairs the mental tone,
And ultimately means perdition.
To illustrate the perfect type :—
Her kiss should be as soft as vellum,
While avid readers pluck the ripe
Fruit of her busy cerebellum;
0 supple lips! 0 seething brain!
Yet if, perforce—no laughing matter—
1 had to choose between the twain,
I'd cheerfully resign the latter.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Tire Baron, en vacance, per rail, river and road (motor-
,car and bike not included in means of transit), loves to
iave with him just a few old friends and two or three new
ones, in the shape of books, in whose society he can pans
many pleasant hours. Not that he is taking a "reading
tour," tutorially; no, he is always the student who only
lives to learn, and who, day by day, learns to live; at least
such is his desire. Thus it falls out, without hurt to any-
one, and with profit to more than one person, that he hath
with him an amusing book, of what may be fairly described
as ' The Eccentric Series,' by H. G. WELLS, entitled The Sea
Lady; also A Bayard from Bengal, by F. AUSTEY, which,
since it first appeared in Mr. Punch's pages, has ever been
a source of intellectual amusement both to the Baron and an
appreciative public. This most entertaining story is now
admirably illustrated by J. B. PARTRIDGE, whose artistic work
intensifies the humour of the original idea, adding greatly to
the reader's enjoymett. Not only does the story of A
Bayard from Bengal come to us as fresh as ever, but the
author has supplemented it withTVie Parables of Piljosh,
by H. B. Jabber-jee, B.A. Both these books bear the imprint
of METHUEN, which, speaking from experience, the Baron
considers may be generally taKen as warranty for their lite-
rary excellence and readable form. When the undecided
voyageur goes to a bool stall at any railway station, he, like
"the anxious cit" distracted by invitations to various
banquets,
"Ponders which to take and which refu»e,"
and seeing some work whose title and author are alike new
to him he looks for the name of the publisher and that
decides him. Eight times out of ten he will not be
disappointed in his selection, that is, if he be on the sure
ground of knowing his own mind in the first instance, and
of the publishing " house of call " where he may be pretty
sure to find (he precise entertainment that his heart desireth.
The Baron, having thus delivered himself of these words of
wisdom, contents himself with recommending, as A propos,
the two books already mentioned. Of TJie Sea Lady the
Baron may say that it is quite up to the mark of The Time
Macldne and The Wonderful Visit by the same author, and
he may add that it is not a work which " a Skipper" -will
care about, as the gems of Mr. WELLS'S humour are, in this
instance, to be found mainly in the descriptive parts of the
story. On another occasion the Baron hopes, by carefully
developing his holiday list, to add thereto the names of not a
few "readables" whereby he may earn the gratitude of his
fellow-travellers, globe-trottera, and holiday-makers by sea
and land, to whom one and all he wishes a good time, with a
continuance of it,'and is theirs sincerely, the careful, cautious
and pleasurably responsible BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

BIRDS OF PARADISE.—The P. M. O. informs us that the
Siun'3 first menu in Paris included "Anges fareis a la

sumed with this heavenly dish, but knowing the temperate
character of the Persian monarch, we are sure that it was
not enough to justif}7 the French proverb, " Le soir, tous Zes
chats sont gris."
THE gallantry of Police-Sergeant STEPHENS, who dived from
the parapet of Vauxhall Bridge to save a boy, has been
suitably rewarded. In more tropical climates it is the boya
who dive for the coppers.
LJ England, says a French writer, motoring is not
considered a sport because it does not involve killing any-
thing. This is but one more example of Continental
aspersion.

RAILWAY REFORM.
To MR. PUNCH,—SIB : The wisdom of a
recent illustrious visitor to our shores
in restricting the speed of the trains in
which he travelled has emboldened me
to suggest a few regulations, which, if
enforced, would render a railway journey
much less trying than it is at present
to those who, like myself, do not care
to take unnecessary risks.
1. Every signal should be kept at
clanger until a train is within five yards
of the post. Upon the arm falling, the
train should immediately stop, in order
that the driver may ascertain whether
the signal was lowered by design or fell
by accident.
2. The driver should not leave his
engine for the purpose of making
enquiries of the signalman, in accordance
with Regulation 1, without first detach-
ing the engine from the train, so that
in case of the inability of the stoker to
restrain the former in the driver's
absence, the passengers will not be
endangered.
3. In every case where the verification
of a signal to proceed (as required by
Regulations 1 and 2) occupies more
than one minute, the engine should be
shunted and placed at a safe distance
in the rear of the train as a protection
against the impact of any following
train.
4. When a train is running on the
level, all brakes should be put hard on
once a mile, in order to ascertain that


LA VIE DE BOHEME.

Second Bohemian. ''An, THAT'S IT I /HAVE A CONSCIENCE. I WANT THE POOR CHAP
TO LOSE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE I"
the same are in working order. In
running up-hill, they should be applied
still more frequently, so that the
passengers may be assured that if the
engine breaks down the train will not
run backwards.
5. All down gradients of greater
steepness than 1 in 10,000 should be
marked dangerous, and the passengers
should be given the option of walking
to the bottom. The driver should have
strict orders to keep in sight any who
prudently avail themselves of the oppor-
tunity, and thus the safety of those who
have the hardihood to remain in the
train will be to some extent guaranteed.
It has also occurred to me that a
lever in each compartment enabling any
passenger to shut off steam would be a
great comfort, but as this would involve
considerable alteration of rolling stock, I
should be content for the present with
the adoption of the foregoing, which
could all easily be put into operation
with existing plant. I am, Sir,
AN OCCASIONAL TOURIST.

MY GLASSES.
(By a Holiday Tourist.)
DELIGHTFUL to possess a first-rate pair of glasses—" bino-
cles," I mean; at least I believe that "binocles" or
"binocle" is the popular and scientific definition of the
article in question, which is neither an opera-glass nor a
telescope, but a compound of the two, the "lenses" (I think
"lenses" is correct, unless I am under some "optical
delusion" on the subject) being as powerful as those of a
lengthy and cumbersome telescope, while its form is that
of a light portable opera-glass such as may be easily carried
in a case attached to a strap over the shoulder (this sounds
painful, at least it did years ago when I was a boy, and it
was painful too), and when slung round you gives the
bearer of them—no matter who he is—the business-like look,
discounted by the rather rakish air, of a turfite belonging to
the "Bookie " division.
Of such glasses in a case I am the proud and happy
possessor. A present—you may be quite sure of that—as
personally, being, like JOHN GILPIN, of a frugal mind, I
should never have indulged myself in such a luxury.
Therefore for them, as " glasses," I have nothing but praise,
as of course one is bound to deal with a gift glass as with a
"gift horse," and "not look a gift binocle in the lens."
There are spots on the sun, so I am told, but I Ve never
seen them, and don't want to. There is a spot on one of
these glasses, but I look over it, under it, and, putting it
aside, ignore it.
Since I have had these glasses the world has assumed
for me a different aspect—several different aspects—and now
I have come to wonder how it could possibly happen that I
should have been, during so many years, travelling about to
so many places—quite a ULYSSES in a small way (including
PENELOPE, minus the suitors)—without these glasses, which
are now absolutely indispensable to my perfect equipment,
not only when en voyage but when promenading on cliffs,
highways and by-the-sea-ways of the Kent coast, where the
coal ought to be. I have a vague recollection of an early
nursery story entitled Eyes and No Eyes, wherein was shown
how Master No Eyes went about seeing nothing (which would
have been quite pardonable if lie had not possessed the
proper visual organs; but he did not keep them open, that
was the author's clever point), while Master Eyes, going
over the same ground, in the company of the aforesaid
Master No Eyes, not only saw everything that was to be
seen, but was perpetually plying his tutor or father (I forget
which) with such a number of puzzling questions as only
the learned editor of Notes and Queries, assisted by his
brilliant staff, could possibly have answered on the spot
truthfully and satisfactorily. "The moral o' this "ere lies in
the application of it."
Before this binocle came into my possession, it was not
often that I paused in my progress to examine the country
round about; and, as to the sea, rarely had I done more
than cursorily glance at passing ships. I saw a ship, and
simply said to myself, "Let that pass." And it did. But
now I am constantly sweeping the horizon: in fact, so
frequently and so carefully do I perform this operation, that I
wonder there is even a speck left on the horizon to be seen.
Averaging every possible occasion, I reckon that I take
my binocle out of its case once in every three minutes; but
I will reconsider this sum in mental arithmetic later on, not
being quite sure of my calculation.
The mechanism of my binocle may be described as
"wheels within wheels" and screws within screws:
mysterious in operation and in effect, but of course
constructed on the latest scientific principles, which are to
me (and by me to anybody else who desires the informa-
tion) quite inexplicable. There is a wheel that goes one
way up to a certain point and no farther; there is another
and a lesser wheel that works in an opposite direction.
There are some screws whose use I have never as yet been
able to ascertain; just as surgeons and doctors have gone on
for years and years without being a bit the wiser as to the
uses for which certain details of the human body were
originally intended; and then there are two " peep-show
holes," as I may fairly term them, at the looking-in end
which are of the form of that peculiar miniature cup (a thing
like an ordinary liqueur-glass in mourning) that a watch-
maker sticks into one eye, shutting the other, when bent
on critically examining something that has gone wrong with
some minute portion of the works of a watch. These
two ends, through which you look, move up and down,
at least I think they do; but having once rashly attempted
to unscrew one of them, and liaving unfortunately succeeded,
I was only too glad to replace it in its position as soon, and
as firmly, as, with trembling hands and beating heart, I
possibly could. After that I left it, imperfectly replaced, I
fear, as the left " peeper" is not quite even with the right;
but when a friend remarked upon this to me I thought it
as well to assume a superior scientific air while informing
him that "this is the way they are made." My friend
happening to be rather an expert in these matters, of which
fact I was unaware, did not express himself as entirely
satisfied with my explanation.
I have said above that I take my glasses out of the case
every three minutes. This, I find, must be an incorrect
computation.
To begin with, I can never, emphatically never, hit off at
the first, nor even at the sixth attempt the precise method
of replacing them (after use) so that the wrong ends shall
not be in the right placse and vice versd; as if they don't
fit in just exactly the lid won't close, the case bulges, and
the glasses will tumble out, or, at all events, can be taken
out by any dishonest person, without my being in the
slightest degree aware of the theft. So I may put it that to
take glasses out of the case occupies about thirty seconds:
sed revoeare gradus, I mean to replace them properly,
may occupy me, in a most exasperating manner too, from
one minute and a half to five.
After taking them out, in order to see, let us say, some
distant object of remarkable appearance, which may be
either the latest specimen of the Destroyer type, or that
"monstrum liorrendum," the Sea-serpent (which is due near
this coast about the beginning of September) I have, first
of all, to adjust the sight. To commence with, everything
is a blurr; if I may, without irreverence, apply the scrip-
tural description of what our planet was before it became
as it is now, I should say every thing, sea and land, as first
seen through my glasses, is "without form and void."
Gradually, after hazarding a few turns at the wheels or the
screws, I observe all sorts of shapes coming into sight: then
I become aware of a curious division of black rims framing,
as it were, indistinct pictures; then, after another revolution
of the mechanism, these segments of circles cut one another,
and I feel that my eyes are straining, and my hands shaking,
and the sea goes up to the sky and the land disappears
entirely; finally, I am about to give it up altogether as a
bad job, when I bethink me of another wheel, as yet untried,
that turns in an opposite direction to any I have as yet
attempted. Eureka! this wheel does the trick—at least,
up to a certain extent. Objects became clearer and nearer;
another turn and the black frame has vanished, and now I
begin to distinguish the distant cliffs from the pier, and I
see distinctly the railings—Eh? Are there iron railings
guarding the coast of France? No—the railings are right
iu front of me! 1 have taken a step back, and I am
looking at things within six feet of my coign of vantage.
Irritating.

Imperturbable Boatman. "HAUD UP YBR BOD, MAN! YE HAVE 'M I YE HAVE 'M!"
Patience, and more turns at both wheels; then at last—ah!
—as clearly as possible 1 do see the distant coast of France,
which is of course very satisfactory to anyone who didn't
know or didn't believe it was there. But what I wanted,
when I began, was to see whether the object, which, at
that particular moment, was almost on the horizon, was
a torpedo-destroyer or a sea-serpent; and now, though
at last I 've got the right sight and can see things ten or
more miles off as clearly as if they were arranged, like
a box of child's toys in front of me—for the life of me
1 can't see what I had originally wished to look at. It has
vanished. If a whale or sea-serpent it has taken advantage
of my delay in arranging the glasses, and perhaps thinking I
was an impertinent amateur photographer taking snap shots
has dived down again to its submarine home.
So, on consideration, and at a moderately fair computation,
it takes me quite twenty minutes to arrange the glasses for
use. If the object has remained stationary, good; if not,
'tis lost to sight though to memory dear. So, taking one
thing with another, from the extraction of glasses from case
to their return after using them [and seeing something,
though not according to the original intention], the perform-
ance occupies me just upon thirty minutes.
And now, Mem. to those whom Providence has blessed with
the gift of glasses or with the means of purchasing the same.
When once you've suited your sight and adapted the
glasses to your own " private view," don't lend them; no, not
to your nearest and dearest relative, and certainly not to your
neighbour. Do to your neighbour as you would advise your
neighbour to do to you, supposing the glasses in his posses-
sion and you requested the loan of them; and refuse him
politely hit firmly. If he owns glasses himself he will
understand and appreciate. If he is not a binocle-proprietor,
and if he be only a vapid, do-nothing, irresponsible gazer,
then if you lend such an one your glasses, he will at once
say, "Ah, this doesn't suit my sight," and will, without
another word, proceed to alter it, and adjust it to his own
peculiarities of vision. After seeing nothing, he will return
them to you with the remark, "Yes, they 're not bad, but
you ought to get your glasses at OBENZWELLER'S" (or some-
body's abroad, generally "made in Germany "). "Ah!—
they are glasses." And you will find that this last state of
your binocle, after leaving his hands, is worse than the
first, as you will occupy quite another half-hour in re-
adjusting them to the use of the person for whom they were
intended, namely, yourself.
These notes I make after two or three short voyages oi
experience on board the gallant " William Edward," of the
S.E. & C. D. fleet, along the Kentish coast, one of the best
trial trips for uncertain sailors (it might be so advertised)
I have ever come across. Three hours to Folkestone, land

glasses (for which I bless the donor), and 'twas here that I
determined to benefit all glass-possessors by my experience.
THE GOLF WIDOWS.
(After E. B. Brcnming.')
Do you hear the widows weeping, 0 my brothers,
Wedded but a few brief years?
They are writing home complaining to their mothers,
And their ink 's suffused with tears.
The young lads are playing in the meadows,
The young babes are sleeping in the nest;
The young men are flirting in the shadows,
The young maids are helping them, with zest.
But the young golf widows, 0 my brothers,
They are weeping bitterly,
They are weeping in the playtime of the others,
While you re swiping from the tee.
> you re swiping
Do you ask your grazing widows in their sorrow
Why their tears are falling so?
"Oh—yesterday—to-day again—to-morrow—
To the links you ALWAYS go!
Your golf 'shop,' " they say, "is very dreary,
You speak 01 nothing else from week to week;
A'really patient wife will grow a-weary
Of talk about a concentrated cleek."
Yes, the young golf-widows, 0 my brothers,
Do you ask them why they weep?
They are longing to be back beside their mothers,
While you 're playing in a sweep.
And well may the widows weep before you
When your nightly round is done;
They care nothing for a stymie, or the glory
Gained by holing out in one.
"How long," they say, "how long in careless fashion,
Will you stand, to drive the Dyke, upon our hearts,
Trample down with nailed heel our early passion,
Turning homeward only when the light departs?
You can hear our lamentations many a mile hence,
Can you hearken without shame,
When our mourning curseth deeper in the silence
Than a strong man off his game "?
OPERATIC NOTES.
Mr. Punch feels that he must applaud the enterprise of
the Moody-Manners Opera Company in providing entertain-
ment in the vernacular at reasonable prices during the dull
days. Their season was pleasantly inaugurated on Monday
the 25th, when Carmen—best of popular operas—was played
before an enthusiastic house, in which the suburban and
provincial elements predominated. Miss ZELIE DE LUSSAN'S
heroine of the strutting gait and swinging hips—perhaps a
shade too accentuated in her motions—had lost little of the
old charm and nothing of the old audacity. Mr. PHILIP
BROZEL, once freed from the paralysing influence of his
dragoon uniform, showed intelligence and a very effective
energy in the part of Jose. The Eeeamillo of Mr. GEORGE
Fox did not justify his profession of bull-fighter by any
adequately taurine quality of voice, though, like most
Escamillos, he was picturesque. The Captain of Dragoons
would have worn a more martial air if he had not held
bis sword-sheath like a silver pencil in his right hand
—here the wrong one. Miss HIOXISCH sang the part of
Michaela gracefully, though her sense of dramatic sympathy
is still immature. The chorus showed signs of good drilling,
and were more often in time with the orchestra than might
have been expected on what was, as rumour goes, a posi-
tively first acquaintance with that body. The phrases that
one caught now and then from the English b'bretto served
to increase one's respect for the common practice of per-
forming opera in a foreign tongue.
Mr. Punch begs to acknowledge the receipt of a statement
from a Press Agent in which Mr. BROZEL is said to have
made a most successful reappearance at Covent Garden
last Monday," and Miss HICKISCH to have " made a most
successful first appearance at Covent Garden." As the
envelope containing these opinions bears a post-mark giving
the hour of despatch as 4.15 P.M. on August 25, and was,
therefore, sent off at least 3| hours before the commencement
of the performance in question, Mr. Punch takes this oppor-
tunity of congratulating the Press Agent on his almost
oracular insight into the paulc-postxfuture.
The performance of Marltana on Thursday, when Miss
FANNY MOODY, Mr. MANNERS, and Mr. COATES gave excellent
renderings of various desultory solos, quite missed distinc-
tion, though the audience was too happy to note this defect.
Their reception of this good old medley recalled vividly a
famous passage in one of Mr. QuiLLER-CoucH's parodies, in
which he speaks of
"The crowd that cheers but not discriminate!."
AN INTERCEPTED DISPATCH.
[" Satisfaction has been given by the Porte in the matter of another item
of the American claims. A rifle, which had b»en confiscated by the authori-
ties, has been restored to its owner."—Daily Paper.}
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,—I have to tell
The tidings of a triumph for our nation,
A diplomatic feat that must compel
Our envious rivals' grudging admiration.
It gratifies me that you should receive
Irom me the first congratulations tendered
On what I dared not hope we should achieve.
Prepare your ears:—The rifle is surrendered!
No Turk shall wield it in a godless fight
To make the Sultan's slavish Empire bigger;
Emancipated eyes shall seek the sight,
And free forefingers tighten on the trigger.
The weapon that was forged on Freedom's soil
Shall ne'er uphold a Tyrant in his station;
The clutch of ABDUL slackens on his spoil;
The Yildiz Kiosk rocks to its foundation.
The Porte, indeed (I know their Eastern ways),
May possibly regard it as a trifle;
I liave a notion that they think it pays
To yield on such a matter as a rifle,
If so to graver matters they may bring
The credit of an excellent intention ;—
That is, of course, an aspect of the thing
It is not necessary we should mention.
Think how, when this announcement circulates,
The foes of freedom will be cowed and frightened
The dignity of our United States
Will be, if possible, increased and heightened.
Let not our counsels be, as others' are,
Secretive, pusillanimous, and murky,
So advertise the statement, near and far,
That we have got that rifle out of Turkey.

I SLEPT awhile, and as I dreamed
A huge Museum met my eye,
Vaster than that so much esteemed
By residents in Bloomsbury.
As I approached the door, a voice
From some dim alcove thundered
down:
"If you would worthily rejoice,
Enter! The fee is half-a-crown."
I paid the trifle specified,
And, noting my bewildered glance,
A singularly courteous guide
Took pity oa my ignorance.
"Here you will witness," he began,
"None of the customary shows;
The choicest treasures known to man
Within this worthy shrine repose.
"For instance, in that gilded case
Which I perceive you gazing at"—
"Yes," I remarked, "a common-place
And ordinary cricket-bat!''
"Not so !" in solemn tones he said,
"Nay, there you have the actual blade
With which J. SMITH" (he bared his
head)
"In thirteen county matches played.
"That piece of chalk, which you discern,
Looks unremarkable, 'tis true,
And yet, irreverent stranger, learn
That it has touched a DAWSOK'B cue!
"This clod of grass is quite unique,
I dare not estimate its worth,
The champion golfer's driving cleek
Removed it from its native earth!

Of deep humility he spoke,—

He spoke another word—I woke!

THE extraordinary rise in Rates in
many districts of London is beginning
to arouse indignation, and an Irate-

The Americans have snapped up
some more valuable contracts in South
Africa, but England has won the
American National Lawn Tennis

declaring the report to be a sensational
one, and the scare ridiculous.
It is fast approaching a scandal that
so little care is taken in the conveyance
of State missives. During the KING'S
recent cruise important documents,
which had to be carried to and from
Scilly, Falmouth, and Penzance, were
entrusted to Torpedo-Boat Destroyers.
A man who was charged with being
drunk and disorderly last week, and
was asked by the Magistrate whether
he had any evidence as to character,
promptly produced a daily paper con-
taining an interview with RAS MAKON-
NEN, in which the RAS, on being asked
what he thought of the English people,
answered, "The people, from the
highest to the lowest, all are good."
King LEWANIKA, I hear, is much
annoyed at a misprint which stated that
he "and his suit" had returned to
Africa.
It is always difficult for a newspaper
to vouch for the accuracy of its news,
and I admire the frankness of one
which publishes a column every day
headed "To-day's Story."
Turkey is endeavouring to borrow
£45,000 in order to pay a month's salary
to State officials on the twenty-sixth

His MAJESTY having expressed a wish
that something extraordinary should be
done on that occasion.
Last week there was no sensational

mated to the Paris Correspondent of the

"WHAT BVER is THAT YOU HAVE DRAWN, MASTER JIMMY 1" "DAT'S A DRAGON AND A PRETTY LADY."
"BoT I DON'T SEE ANY LADY" "'Cos THE DRAGON HAS EATKD THE PRETTY LADY UP!"
NATURE NOTES.
I HAVE observed, Mr. Punch, that
almost all the daily papers have taken
lately to publishing a column about
birds, beasts, and flowers, which figures
pleasantly, not to say unexpectedly,
among political speeches and Stock
Exchange reports. Why should not
you add this delightful feature to your
pages? I am quite willing (for a con-
sideration) to supply it; and the fact
that I know nothing of botany or
natural history is, to judge from your
contemporaries, not the slightest draw-
back. The one requisite for the writing
of such a column seems to be the pos-
session of a poetic and flowery style.
The specimen notes which I append
will convince you that I am fully
equipped in this respect.
Harvest time! How rich in sweet
associations is that dear old phrase!
And it is with us once more; even as 1
write the swish of the scythe among the
wheat falls pleasantly upon my ear.
And to-morrow, they tell me, if the
weather be fair, the wild oats—apt
symbol these of the days that are no
more!—will be garnered, pressed, and
heaped within the oast-house ere the
winter storms begin. And then the
fanner with his sturdy toilers will
gather in the gabled farm and keep
their harvest-home, with draughts of
foaming cider to gladden their hearts;
—right honest cider this, none of your
foreign stuff, but distilled from goose-
berries raised on the farm.
How often the trained eye of the
bird-lover catches sight of rare songsters
which are quite unfamiliar to the
average man and woman! Thus no
later than yesterday I saw in a walnut-
copse a pair of blue-tailed bobfinches.
Now the blue-tailed bobfinch is quite
uncommon in this country, so the
reader may imagine the care with which
I watched these creatures. Their habits
are most remarkable. Taking a short
run, they move their wings rapidly,
and by this means rise high in the air.
On the same morning I saw, quite close
to the farm, an almost rarer bird, the
golden dabchick (dabchickla aureatd).
Thia, I found subsequently, had been
kept in confinement for some time by
the farmer's wife, and had just escaped.
The rustic folk hereabouts speak of it
as "Missuses caneery," a quaint local
term, for the derivation of which 1
cannot account.
This is a busy time of year for the
entomologist, and I hasten to assist the
beginner in this fascinating science by
some useful hints. Many waste money
on quite unnecessary nets and other
paraphernalia. The only requisites for
forming a good collection are a loaf of
bread, a pot of jam (strawberry is said
to give the best results), and a bicycle.
The modus operandi is as follows.
You invite some friends to tea in a
wood and present each of them with a
slice of bread and jam. Then you
leave them and go for a short ride on
the bicycle. In a few minutes you will
have a choice collection of small flies iri
your eyes, which you can remove at
leisure. On your return you will find
a Bvvarm of wasps, bluebottles, and
other of the larger insects around the
heads of your friends and in the jam-
pot.
And now I must pause. The im-
perious hush of night, and the fact that
I have done my 500 words, alike bid me
lay aside my pen. The honey-laden
bee has retired to his nest, the sweet
cooing of the swallows is heard, and a
faint fragrance from the cabbage-bed
haunts the twilight air. 'Tis night.
And in twelve hours it will be morning.
Ah, wondrous mystery of Nature!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAftlVAKI.
ATHLETES AT BOW STREET,
in.
CHARLES BURGESS FRY, 30, journalist,
was charged by the Institute of Journal-
ists with neglecting his profession by
playing cricket.
Sir WEMYSS REID, called for the
prosecution, stated that the prisoner's
success with the pen was very striking.
He wrote everything except leaders, but
was expected to begin those directly
in view of recent dux. He had been
grieved to see the prisoner's name in
the cricket reports.
Mr. BENNET BURLEIGH, special corre-
spondent of the Daily Telegraph, said
that he had written articles
under trying enough circum-
stances, but he had never suc-
ceeded, as the prisoner did, in
playing cricket and writing
at the same moment. The
witness did not consider that
an article written while run-
ning a cut for three could be
as good as one written in the
security of one's study.
Mr. C. ARTHUR PEARSON, who
said that he was the Editor of
the Daily Express, gave evi-
dence proving the prisoner's
ability with the pen. He
added, however, that it was
necessary that he played
cricket too.
Sir GEORGE NEWNES corrobo-
rated.
KUMAR SHRI RANJITSINHJI,
who on entering the witness-
box gave the prisoner a leg
glance of recognition, said
that the prisoner was not to
blame. Authors must play
sometimes; he himself did,
although he had written the
Jubilee Book of Cricket and
edited a boys' paper. It was not true
that he was known as the Indian Inker.
Other authors, including Mr. P. F.
WARNER, Mr. D. L. A. JEPHSON, and
Mr. F. A. IREDALE (by special wire),
corroborated.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that the present
talk about exercise was absurd. No one
needed exercise. He never took exercise
himself, beyond cleaning his eye-glass.
He had never previously heard of Mr.
FRY, nor did he understand the game of
cricket; but he would undertake to get
a bigger price per 1,000 words for an
article on the game, without exercise,
than Mr. FRY could, with all his caper-
ing about on what he had been led to
believe was called the pitch. What he
had said he had said.
Mr. SIDNEY LEE gave evidence in sup-
port. He said that he had written many
hundreds of thousands of words on no
exercise at all. All that he needed was
a little BACON. If Mr. FRY was so fanci-
ful that he could not write without
playing cricket, he would never get into
the Dictionamj of National Biography.
The Bench sentenced the prisoner to
several long innings unaccompanied by
his note-book.
Mr. EUSTACE MILES, amateur champion
at Racquets and Tennis, who recently
appeared as a witness in the trial of
Mr. H. L. DOHERTY, was charged with
fasting for three days without any pro-
vocation.
Mr. DANCKWERTZ, K.C., who prose-
cuted on behalf of the Licensed Victual-
lers' Association, contended that the

punishment could be too severe for a
man who advocated abstention from a
carnivorous diet.
PETER LATHAM, the professional
Racquets and Tennis champion, said
that if Mr. MILES only could put more
beef into his stroke there would be no
holding him.
Mr. G. BERNARD SHAW, who appeared
for the defence, asserted that his client
had been grossly misrepresented. Mr.
MILES expressly stated that he "ate a
lot too much " after his fast, and that
he " did not think he would ever do a
complete fast again." He was merely
anxious to test his ability of endurance,
and here Mr. SHAW read the following
touching passage from Mr.
MILES'S own account of the
results of his experiment:—
"I feel additional confi-
dence in my power of self-
control, though I grant that
my sister was kind enough to
take out of my room the
fruits and other foods that
generally stand there, particu-
larly some clear-veined thin-
skinned gooseberries. I did
not expose myself to the full
temptation."
This conclusively proved
that, as a rule, Mr. MILES did
not despise food. As for the
gooseberries, he believed that
they were positively gigantic.
After a consultation the
Bench decided that a man
who would eat gooseberries
at the end of August was
capable of anything, and
sentenced Mr. MILES to join
the Beefsteak Club without
a moment's delay.
doctrines enunciated by Mr. MILES in
the record of his experiment published
in the Daily Mail of the 28th ult. were
of a most pernicious and unpatriotic
character. Mr. MILES was an accom-
plished athlete, and his example could
not fail to exert a most dangerous
influence on those who sought to
rival his record. England's empire
was built up on the consumption of
prime ox-beef—here Mr. DANCKWERTZ
quoted CALVERLEY with thrilling effect
—and not on tabloids, lozenges or bis-
cuits. The feeling in Leadenhall
Market agninst Mr. MILES was very
strong; indeed he would not like to
answer for the consequences if the
prisoner were not restrained from
further experiments of this deplorable
character.
Mr. HANBURY, the President of the
Board of Agriculture, gave evidence for
the prosecution. He considered that no
As the Court was rising a

age, who seemed to be in acute

of moderate means, aged 53 and a
grandfather, had been so much im-
pressed by the success of Mr. CHARLES
HUTOHINGS that he was now devoting his
entire energies to emulating the achieve-
ments of his contemporary. This, in
itself, was an innocent ambition enough,
but the methods adopted were most
undesirable. Thus he had purchased
at immense cost a wry-necked platinum
putter, and had invented a golfing boot
with aluminium toe-caps and a rubber-
cored heel which he declared had added
thirty yards to his drive. In spite of
all this equipment and outlay, his
handicap was still 24, and she was
informed by his friends that at his
present rate of progress he was not

him that this was not fair to the House-

'Give a thing; take a thing; black

such unchivalrous conduct. He hoped

"NINE BRAVE MEN."
EXTRACT FROM THE TKAVIL DIABY OF
TOBY, M.P.
Caister, Monday.
TO-DAY the rare August sunlight falls
on. the chancel of the old parish church
through windows softly dight. It lights
up the simple inscription, " To the glory
of God, and in memory of nine brave
men." These are they who, on a wild
November night in last year, put out in
their trusted lifeboat in answer to the
signal for help flaring on the Berber
Sand. For two hours they fought with
sea and storm before they could launch
their boat. For some of us that would
have been sufficient excuse to stay at
home. They had striven hard. If the
sea would only let them they would
brave its dangers and go to the rescue
of the helpless crew on the stranded
ship. What would you? They had
done their best. Let them get back to
bed.
But, as old HAYLETT said when, at
the inquest that followed, the Coroner
nsked whether at a perilous moment
they did not think of making for the
shore, "Caister men never turn back."
At the end of two hours the lifeboat
crew were still tugging at the oars,
hoping to get out of the surf and make
for the stranded ship. Five minutes more
anil they had passed the furious barrier
and were tossing on the sea. They
reached the vessel only to find that help
liacl come from another quarter, and that
the crew were saved. Ihey put back to
the shore, but almost as they reached
it a gigantic wave lifted the bout in its
arms and turned it upside down, with
its crew of a dozen imprisoned in this
strange vault., Three managed to crawl
out. Nine found a watery grave, with
their own familiar boat overtopping
them as a tombstone.
This gallant deed, with its tragic
ending, stirred the nation to pro-
foundest depths. The "nine brave
men" were past help or redemption.
The wives and little ones left behind
became the people's care. A sum ex-
ceeding £12,000 was promptly sub-
scribed, and the widows and orphans
are liberally provided for. The
memorial window in the parish church
is the drowned sailors' share of the
tribute. In the simple hearty words
spoken by the Bishop after the dedica-
tion of the window, he mentioned that
there remained on it a debt of £150.
"This congregation can," he said, "if
they like, wipe off the debt before they
leave the church."
And they did. The collection having
been made, a visitor from London sent
a message to the Rector undertaking to
make up whatever sum was necessary
in supplement.

Fine weather on Caister beach this
morning. German Ocean laps the;
shore as gently as if it had never broken
up a ship or drowned a sailor. Yet a
little way out its white teeth flash j
ominously over a shoal. On the beach
is a curious wooden structure ap-1

steps. It is the crow's nest from
which, night and day, watch is kept
over the far-reaching ocean. Close by
is a bell, the sound of which is oiJy too
familiar in Caister. It was rung on
November 14, 1901, summoning the
lifeboat crew from their comfortable
beds, to which nine out of twelve
never returned. On the beach we came
across old HAYLETT, still hale in spite of
his more than seventy years, hearty
even under the crushing memory of two
sons and a grandson entombed under
the lifeboat.
"How many times have you been out
in the lifeboat?" the MEMBER FOB SAUK
asked.
The old man turned with a surprised
look. Only a landsman, a lubber from
some distant town, would ask such a
question.
"Lor1 bless yer!" said HAYLETT,
"hundreds o' times. I never kep
count."
We might, if we were so disposed,
reckon up how many times we have
crossed the Channel on holiday bent.

SNUB FOR A SNOB.
English Tourist. "Aw—THAT BUTTERMILK WAS VERY NICK, MY DEAR. WHAT PAYMENT
DO YOU EXPECT FOR IT?"
Cottage Girl. "WE WOULDN'T BE AFTER ASKING ANY PAYMENT. SURE WE OIVM IT TO
THE PIOS t"
night to save the lives of unknown
mates in peril on the sea.
The KINO, ever ready to do a gracious
act, sent for HAYLETT to present him
with the medal decreed to him for
saving life.
"The fust pusson I come across, iu
the Palace," said HAYLETT, gazing reflec-
tively on the breakers on the shoal,
"was the Prince of WALES. Him and
me got on all right together, for you
see he 's been afloat. 'HAYLETT,' says
he, 'you wait here a bit till the KINO
heaves insight.' 'Right you are, Sir,' says
I. When the KINO come alongside he was
quite affable. Shook me by the hand
and passed the time of day real
ornerally like. 'I 'in an onlarn'd man,
0 KING," ses I. 'I can't neither read nor
write. But this I do say. 0 KINO,
I hope you '11 live to bo a hundred,
and may you and all your family go to
Heaven arterwards.1 He looked quite
pleased."
SAHK discerned in this quaint method
of address to Royalty reminiscence of
the morning lesson heard in church from
boyhood's days. It was the old fisher-
man's paraphrase of the familiar address,
"0 King, live for ever."
Under the shelter of the grey
church tower sleep together—their last
watch below—the "nine brave men"
of whom this old salt, with his recollec-
tions of affable Majesty, fathered three.
Their bodies are under hatches. Their
souls have gone aloft. But as long as
there are iisherfolk in the village,
Caister may be counted upon to find
nine others, if need be ninety more, to
take their places. "Caister men never
turn back." When the new lifeboat
is finished, this legend should be
inscribed by the tiller. No walled city,
from the time of Troy, boasts a prouder
motto.
"LAUDABUNT ALII."
On! Aix is the place for the waters,
And Nice for consumptives, no doubt;
The Indies for mothers with daughters,
And Carlsbad for fathers with gout;
Some seek Monte Carlo to gamble,
While some in the Tyrol will rove,
And Norway 's correct for a ramble,
But I go to Trouville for love.
What sweet recollections nine letters
Embody in spelling that name!
What links in a chain of soft fetters,
All silken and never the same!
What dreams of blue seas and gay
seasons,
Blue eyes, and blue heavens above—
Globe-trotters have various reasons,
But I go to Trouville for love.
I think the first year it was GERTIE,
Bewitching American maid,
With j ust enough go to be flirty,
And just enough sense to be staid.
To think of her wit, and her dancing,
Those rides, and the seat in the grove;
What wonder I found her entrancing—
Of course I left Trouville in love.
How empty I felt and how sorry
To meet her next season no more;
How sweetly adorable FLORRY
My tempers in consequence bore.
My FLORRY—I soon had no pleasure
Except in her smile: that's her
glove,
Which I solemnly vowed I would trea-
sure
The night I left Trouville in love.
Then NELLIE, the player of tennis,
Whose "left" was as good as her
"right,"
To tell of whose prowess my pen is
Inadequate, impotent quite.
And LAURA, the haughty new-comer,
Who dowagers doubted was fast,
Who scorched me the whole of one
summer,
And left me a cinder at last.
And AXNIE But why should I linger
My various follies to name,
To tell off each one on a finger ?—
The place, 'tis the place that's to
blame.
There 's a spell in the air, I maintain it,
A spell from the planets above—
Astrologers, ye may explain it,
While I go to Trouville for love.

THE FOWL AND THE JEWEL.
(Latest Edition.)
[" A lady loit a diamond in a Paris tab. The
cabman keep* fowU. One of the fowls wu killed,
and the diamond wu found in iti
-aptr.]
ONCE a Parisian pullet saw —
While scratching in her owner's straw
In hopes, perhaps, of dainty fare —
A handsome diamond lying there.
Well-versed in LA FONTAINE, she knew
What fowls of culture ought to do;
So, to display superior wit,
With a wry face she swallowed it.
Alas! when diamonds are lost,
A hen's life is a trifling cost;
So with a twisted neck she dies —
Her ransacked gizzard yields the prize.
MORAL.
Her JEsop though a hen may know,
Over the cock ahe need not crow.
THE NOVELTY SYNDICATE.
(By Mr. Punch's Imaginative Reporter.)
II.—THE MAGAZINE DEPABTMENT.
No expense will be spared (said the
representative millionaire of the New
Magazine scheme) to run the monthly
magazines—which are being bought up
rapidly—on entirely fresh lines. To
ensure this, a list of regulations and
hints to contributors has been pre-
pared. Their severity is obvious—
though not so obvious as magazine
articles themselves have been up to now.
The more important regulations are as
follows:—•
As regards fiction—
(1) That it is possible for a young
man and girl to exchange remarks in a
train or at a house party or at an hotel
abroad without necessarily finding out
that they are "all in all to one another,
dearest love," and that life had " hitherto
been a blank."
(2) That a girl may sometimes travel
by herself without a maniac getting in
at the first stopping place.
(3) That every girl who takes up
type-writing is not "divinely tall and
most divinely fair," nor does she
inevitably capture the heart of the first
editor or author for whom she may do
some work, and who has hitherto been
adamant to feminine charms.
(4) That every villain need not own
a run-away motor; nor every hero drive
a motor with iron nerve and at record
speed the first time he essays one.
(5) That married people do occasion-
ally tolerate each other, and that even
misunderstandings do not always end
in the wife leaving London by the boat-
train with a comparative stranger.

G. '_.
Horrijied Little Girl (steiny her Mamma in evening dress for tkt Jlnt time). "OH, MUMMY,
YOU'RJ KtVSR OOINO DOWN I.IKE THAT! YOU'VK FORGOTTEN TO PUT OX YOUR TOP
PART 1"
As regards other articles—
(6) That it is not of vital importance
to learn that the quantity of soup drunk
annually by a City alderman would float
a new penny daily, or that the amount
of saccharine substance consumed by a
schoolboy in three years would keep a
popular interviewer alive for three
weeks.
(7) That every lady who is photo-
graphed is not necessarily a type of
English beauty.
As regards matters in general—
(8) That, since big circulations are so
distressingly common, the object of the
"Novelty" Magazine should be to have
as few readers as possible.
(9) That, in view of the select audience
to which appeal would be made, con-
tributors be required to pay heavily for
the privilege of having articles inserted.
"And," concluded the Representa-
tive, with a far-away expression, "as
everybody now writes for magazines,
we fancy tliat the 'Novelty' Magazine
will be a big success."

THE PIPER OF POSEN
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T DANCE TO HIM.
Am (vagudy): "Hamelin Town's in Brunswick."
h
POSEN town "s in Posen,
And that's a province of Prussia;
And round this way, as you should know,
A matter of ninety years ago,
The Great Man brought his travelling show
Prior to leaving it badly frozen
Out on the ruthless plains of Russia.
Forts and bastioned towers determine
The range of the city every side,
And through it rolls the Warthe's tide
Washing the place, yet not so well
But the delicate German sense can tell
The taint that comes, when the winds are low,
From Slavs and such like vermin.
n.
Poles!
They breed so fast by swarms and shoals,
And can't be kept in their proper station,
But want a voice—poor ignorant drolls—
In the matter of popular education!
Pay, it's true, their taxes and tolls,
But won't remain like primitive molea
In suitable subterranean holes,
Nor adopt a decently servile air
To German officials planted there
With full permission to ply their staves
On the knuckles of contumacious knaves;
Forget, in fact, their Helot rales,
And claim to preach
Freedom of speech
And the general use of their private souls!
m.
So it happened that one fine dusty day,
When matters had grown a shade too warm,
WILLIAM the War-Lord rode that way
In a terrible Prussian uniform.
And first he called for his mailed fist,
And gave his moustaches an upward twist,
And cried, as he buckled his burnished glaive,
"I '11 teach My Poseners how to behave!
Let not a Slav attempt to show
(If he wants, that is, to remain alive) a
Nose or an eye as past I go
Full-rigged, but otherwise like GODIVA!"
And then he rehearsed a speech, "What ho!
Hark! ye serfs, to the tramp of My retinue,
And the fear of Me and of God I '11 beget in you!"
IV.
On second thoughts he smoothed his brow,
And sheathed bis fist in a velvet glove,
And stuck in his helm an olive bough,
And said, "I will stoop to win their love!
I '11 have My people to make them merry
And greet My pageantry, passing through,
From all available points of view."
And straight he summoned a fleet equerry,
And "Spur," cried he, " to yonder town,
And bid My army and brave police
Not to commit a breach of the peace,
Nor shoot, nor maim, nor trample down
More of My Poles than necessary."
V.
And so with suave salute, he
Led in his league of troops,
And German throats grew fluty
With Hochs and loyal whoops;
But scarce an alien seemed aware
Of the KAISER'S condescending air;
Nothing impressed the passive Poles,
Not even his charger's caracoles;
Never a hip or a haunch went swaying,
So to speak, to the piper's playing;
And though they behaved with perfect tact
Only a sprinkling grasped the fact
That a War-Lord riding there in state
Was a lovable object to contemplate!
VI.
And then in a well-prepared oration
(Other than such as go with the wassail—
Pilsener, not your British crass ale),
Poured in the ear of the Burgomaster,
Whose gratified heart went faster and faster,
He made a regal proclamation,
Allowing the city by special grace
To be no longer a fenced place—
A scheme that I chance to know was not
Thrown off extempore, on the spot,
While the generous blood ran red and hot,
But one that his wisdom had long ago meant
To put in force when he found the moment
Psychologic and melodramatic
For making the favour more emphatic.
And when ne touched on the extra space,
And ventured to hope it would meet the case
Of the housing problem, and quickly cure
The ills of Posen's deserving poor—
Why, then on the actual men, it seems,
For love of whom he had launched these schemes
At Heaven knows how much fiscal cost,
This strangely liberal move was lost.
And the thing was a most amazing frost.
VII.
You can take a Pole, as I understand,
And play on his nerves with a German band,
But you can't convert his natural temper or
Get him to jig for a German EMPEROR. 0. S.
Notubilia Ficta.
[Ma. SEDDON: "One can never tell where one will finally go, but at
present I am perfectly satisfied with New Zealand." From Nutabilia Dicta
in the fall Mall Oazttte.]
FOLLOWING the above excellent example, notwithstanding
the painful ambiguity of its opening sentence, Mr. Punch
proposes to pluck from time to time a few similar flowers
of rhetoric or platitude. He begins with a single instance,
suggested by the character of one of our greatest, living
Manxmen.
Mr. Hall Caine: Loyalty and patriotism are perfectly
summed up in the noble saying—ego et metis rex.
Every Accommodation.
FROM the Hotel advertisements in Bradshaw we take the
following (decently suppressing the name and place) :—
"FAMILY AND COMMEBCIAL.—Hunters and Saddle Hone* kept. Potting
in all its branches. Open and Glass Hearse, and all equipment! for First-
class Funerals."
There is a catholicity about this which recalls the func-
tions of St. Martin's-le-Grand, where "posting in all its
•branches" includes the conveyance of dead letters.

AN EXPERT OPINION.
Smithereens, Co. Donegal.
DEAR SIR,—Nothing will impede pro-
gressive legislation in the Transvaal
more than the proposed dynamite tax.
An article of daily use — in fact a
national industry—in my own country,
dynamite reduces over - population,
clears open spaces, but, above all, is an
unsurpassed medium for putting pres-
sure on a despotic Government. A
timorous local officialdom is therefore
naturally protectionist in policy. Placed
in the hands of a corrupt oligarchy
(with a time-fuse attached) the explosive
will instantaneously secure the free
speech and individual independence so
dear to a young country. I enclose a
specimen. Yours,
Air IRISH GENTLEMAN.
LITERS INSANIORES.
(Twenty-First Century.)
I. FROM A LETTER IN THE "TIMES."
. . . "amounting to a public scandal.
Yesterday, for example, I had to travel
from Dover to London. There was not
a vestige of a thunder-cloud in the air,
so that, on this occasion at least, the
habitual excuse of the South Eastern
Electric Railway—that of 'atmospheric
electrical disturbances '—was unavail-
ing. None the less, Sir, we were
actually one-and-a-half minutes late in
arriving at the terminus, and our rate
of travelling worked out at 122'5 miles
an hour! And this, if you please, was
a so-called 'express' train! Long-
suffering as the public is, the South-
Eastern directors will find that there
are limits to its patience. Possibly it
may seem to them a fine piece of
humour to describe as an 'express'
a train which crawls painfully along at
little over two miles a minute, but I
ask the aid of your powerful journal to
assure them," etc., etc.
II. FROM A LETTER IN THE "DAILY
NEWS."
..." A regrettable chapter in the
history of the Liberal party, now closed,
we trust, for good. Our internal dis-
sensions have wrought untold mischief.
They have delayed the righteous admin-
istration of this country by more decades
than we care to count. But we will
not waste time over unavailing regrets.
The gloomy night is ended, the tardy
dawn is here at last. The period of
disunion is over; with closed ranks and
unanimous battle-cry the Liberal party
begins to-day its march to victory.
"I had written this much when
there came into my hands the speech
delivered last night by the leader of the

Captain Smythc (a goad soldier, but no Society man, to his Ju>3tes>). '' I HAVE TO THANK YOU,
MBS. BROWN, FOR AN EVENING WHICH HAS BEEN—ER—APTXR TWO YXAKS ON THE TMLD,
MO8T ENJOYABLE."
Opposition in the Lords, in which he
allowed himself to criticise somewhat
sharply the policy of his confrere in
the Commons. His description of it as
'crass idiocy' seems to me, at this
juncture, not wholly wise. Just when
we hoped that we had gained complete
unity," etc., etc.
ILT. FROM A LETTER IN THE "DAILY
CHRONICLE."
". . . . with honest indignation the
correspondence headed 'Should Men
Work?' Shame, Sir, shame, I say,
upon my fellow-women who allow such
a question even to be asked! Is
chivalry, then, quite extinct? My dear
husband cooks our little dinner, and
prattles with darling baby—yes, Mr.
'Iconoclast,' sneer, if you like !—but,
rather than ask that tender and fragile
creature to work, I would cheerfully be
an aerial-bus-conductor. And I have
yet to learn," etc., etc.
IV. FROM A LETTER IN THE "FIELD."
". . . . threatens, in my opinion, to
spoil the game. I do not deny that the
previous novelties introduced from the
other side of the Atlantic have proved
beneficial to golfers. But this new
Smackwell ball, which the worst driver
on the links can send a mile or more,
even with a topped stroke, is by no
means a blessing. I do not mind
paying a fair price—say £5, or so—for
a good ball, but nine guineas is really
too much. I have no pretensions to
speak as a first-class player, for I seldom
complete an eighteen-hole course in less
than twenty-five strokes, yet I venture
to urge," etc., etc.

HAPPY SHADES IN COLLEGE.
(To the Master of Trinity.)
IN from the narrow -winding street
We pass as we were wont to pass,
Avoiding still with timorous feet
The level lawns of sacred grass.
And, even as happy shades might sport
Through a bright space of storied tombs,
We saunter through the grey old Court,
And mark, each one his ancient rooms.
The gates are there on either hand,
Their niches crowned with founder-kings;
Still with a pensive murmur bland
The ripple of the fountain sings.
Yes! peopled by another race
And alien to our hopes and fears,
It is, it is, the dear old place,
Unchanged through all the changing years.
Lo! shadows of our buried prime,
Not as we were but as we are,
With all our heavy load of time,
Master, we come to you from far.
A gathered troop of wandering ghosts
Caught up and newly called from sleep,
To you and your array of hosts
Back from the vanished past we creep.
If, as we throng into the Hall,
Our steps, that erst were light as air,
With labouring gait sedately fall;
And if you note our grizzling hair;
And if the word we fain would speak
Dies on our lips and we are dumb;
And if the tear is on our cheek.
Master, forgive, since we are come.
We, who were once imagined men
Too gay to guard our fleeting joy,
At your behest we come again,
Our minds reversed, to play the boy.
And while we still prolong the night %
Intent to make the hours creep slow,
Jealous and in our own despite
We feel the treasured moments go.
* » » * •
But one who from a window leant,
(May Heaven forgive the graceless youth:
No harm that fresh-faced fellow meant,
But, ah, he spoke a bitter truth.)
He smiled, he opened wondering eyes
And called a friend—" This sight is queer!
What brings," he said with some surprise,
"This crowd of fogeys trooping here?"
He could not chill our glowing hearts :—
When, each his boyhood's friends among,
Our shades replayed their ancient parts,
We felt, we knew that we were young.
And, ere we pass, our meed of thanks
Shall to our hosts be duly paid.
We lived a day—the Stygian banks
Reclaim their own, and we must fade.

A HOLIDAY NOTE. j
SIR,—For the benefit of many whose vacation is as limited
as their means, may I be permitted to suggest an outing
from my own personal experience? Thank you. When
within hail of the big ship La Marguerite, anyone "qui
a le pied marin," and no "impedimenta" or other incum-
brances, may en garyon make a pleasant holiday by crossing
to Ostend and back (to Margate or Tilbury), which, if Miss
Marguerite is half-an-hour or so unpunctual, gives a good
eight (or twelve, according to your point of departure) hours,
there and back, of sea breeze, with plenty of room on board
to take your accustomed exercise. Of course you know
Ostend by heart and you don't want to land, or if you do
'tis simply to enjoy a cup of coffee, such as can be made
only on-the Continent, and a light cigarette, and then once
more aboard the gallant barque. Given a fine day and a
calm sea, and though you may have about nine hundred or
a thousand other souls and bodies on board besides your-
self and friends yet they are of no account as far as you
and your small party are concerned, since they are like the
poor—not as being " always with us," but as described in
the familiar verse:—
"Whene'er I take my walks abroad
How many poor I see,
And 'cos I never speaks to them
They never speaks tame;"
and, "weather permitting " (tout eat la), they are all enjoy-
ing themselves quietly enough, as Ostend does not offer to
'ARRY and 'ARHIET the irresistible attractions of the Boulogne
guai, where, so to speak, it is all "beer and skittles."
So the Ostend trip is not much of a favourite with 'ARRIET
and 'ARRY.
I gather from some expressions which fell from the lips
of an elderly lady that an infallible remedy against mal de
mer was "once upon a time" invented by some Irish Pope
of the name of ROACH. Hence probably the infallibility of
the remedy. Perhaps this eminent Pope, of whom I never
heard till now (but that fact is not absolutely against his
historic existence), being sick of the See, determined to
vacate it and take a simple cure. This is a byway of history
which I must look into. But there are scraps of knowledge
to be picked up partout even on a holiday trip at sea by
Your own TRUSTED TOURIST.
OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
IN Mrs. Clyde (METHUEN) JULIEN GORDON relates the story
of a social career. The scene is laid partly in Boston, partly
in New York, with the inevitable visit to Europe. My
Baronite is not familiar with the name of the writer, but is
inclined chereher la femme. Set a woman to describe a
woman. Only a woman could enter into the zest of Mrs.
Clyde's pursuit of a favourable position in the social firma-
ment. Only a woman could fully picture the glory of her
success, the pity and pathos of her declining years. Also,
only a woman would write a paragraph like this :—
"The tea bell rang through the house. The table was set with cold ham,
two mince pies as side dishes, preserves in saucers, at each plate dough-nuts
and apples in plated basketl. J/r.\. Dunham poured the tea; Mr. Dunham
carved the ham. Ellen bore in the hot biscuits, which she dispensed."
That is not inviting, and, happening on an early page, is
calculated to send the reader off to some other book. If he
holds on he will come to a fine dramatic scene, swiftly,
vividly described, where Mrs. Clyde calls upon the mother
of the youth who has run off with her daughter, retreating
after battle royal. Pauline, the stolen daughter, is an
interesting study of a kind widely differing from the mother.
The book is, indeed, full of character, which JULIEN GORDON
handles with increased ease and skill as her task advances.

THE RECRUIT'S PROGRESS.—IV.
IT is over. I, too, have played the Volunteer—not with-
out glory—on the tented plain of Sarum. Six days have I
manoeuvred and done many things which, at my time of
life, I ought not to have done. I have lain for hours prone
on nay stomach in dripping grass. I have fed on tomatoes,
and steak-pudding, and cheese and other forbidden fruit.
I have made my couch for seven nights on Mother Earth,
my aching head pillowed on a kit-bag whose principal
surface-contents were boot-trees and dubbing-tins and similar
hardware, vainly seeking to supplement my damp pyjamas
with elusive army blankets. For if by good fortune they
happened to belong to my nearest tent-companion, they
were promptly jerked away, more in anger than in sorrow,
from my shivering limbs, whereas, if they were my rightful
property, they wriggled away of their own accord. Never-
theless, for three days I revelled in the primitive simplicity
of the life: I even drank beer and cider. On the fourth,
offended Nature asserted herself; rheumatism, sciatica and
indigestion marked me for their own, and on the seventh
I hobbled home, a decrepit invalid with blistered feet.
My numerous female friends are, I find, only too anxious
to restore me to health. "Mind," says one of them, in
the postscript to her last letter, "I insist on your trying
Pine Pills. My bootboy's aunt has had exactly your symp-
toms for years, and she lives on nothing else." (The italics
are my own.) Another recommends Liver Beans. She writes
that her cook has cured her housemaid's knee with them, or
her housemaid her cook's knee—I forget which—and that I
positively must take to them. And I am afraid I shall have
to, in spite of the fact that I am neither a cook nor a house-
maid, and that as a rule one doesn't have indigestion in
one's knee. Finally, I have another friend, who does not
wish me to try any remedies, for the excellent reason that
she says I have nothing wrong with me. Pain 'f Oh, dear
no: there's no such thing. Good is all: therefore,
obviously, all is good. Apple tart, for instance? Certainly.
Why, then, does it produce this tired feeling of having
swallowed a live lobster with red-hot claws? Isn't that
indigestion? Not at all, that's imagination. So to please
her, while she is "treating" me, I call it by that name.
But it still hurts.
After this somewhat painful digression, let me say that
for those who are still young I can imagine no healthier and
more attractive life than that of camp. Nowhere is a young
fellow likely to run across such a host of pleasant and kindly
companions, or such a universal spirit of good-fellowship.
The recruit will find the older members of the corps
especially those of his own tent, almost squabbling with one
another as to which shall show him how to adjust the straps
and buckles of the fearful and wonderful harness which the
patient private has to wear; how to roll his coat, and clean
bis rifle, and put on his leggings, and shake his bedding, and
brail up the tent, and all the thousand and one little tasks
which fill up the time from parade to parade. Their chiel
weakness is to talk of the first duty of a soldier, and then
neglect it. For instance, one man in my tent, having
informed me that the first duty was to keep one's impedi-
menta on the right side of one's palliasse, invariably placed
his own on the wrong, that is, the left side, and then looked
reproachful when he discovered my well-dubbined boots
sitting on his only clean shirt. Another—he was an Editor
fairly well informed and comparatively unassuming—was
always so busy talking that he never made his bed, which
consequently formed the nucleus of a general rubbish-heap
for the rest of us. Yet he was quite the old soldier, and
really thought himself rather smart till the Adjutant pulled
his trousers down—over his leggings. From him I learnt
the following tent-rules. If you wish, to dispose of cigarette
nds, matches, bits of oily rag and so forth, throw them out
at the back of your tent, so that they may seem to have come
[rom the door of the tent behind. (We threw ours on the
;op of his blankets, but that is by the way.) If you must
touch the tent when it is raining, do it over somebody else's
bed. If you hear the word "fatigue" dropped by one in
authority, run like a hare. Don't bring six boot-laces, or
dubbing, or brown-polish, or scissors, or buttons, or a
looking-glass, or razor-strops to camp with you. They only
fill up your kit-bag, and someone eke is sure to have them.
Camp-life makes one feel wonderfully like an ant. We
were all so much alike, and we were so busy and so tiny, and
we showed such remarkable instinct in finding our way to
our own particular cranny in the ant-heap. At five in the
morning, long before any sensible cocks were about, we
were white ants (the punctilious few arrayed in shoes and
towels), scurrying backwards and forwards to the bathing-
pool which, to the huge surprise of the rest of the brigade,
we had had constructed by the engineers. The red ants
with the north-country accent were never tired of looking at
us—we were such beggars to wash. Afterwards, till 6.30,
followed a time of brushing, a brushing of chins, and hair,
and teeth, and nails, and boots, and a cleaning of tents and
bedding and rifles, which lasted without any interval for
relaxation till the bugle went for Adjutant's parade. Then
once more a scurrying, more orderly this time, and in a few
minutes the ants are drawn up in regular grey rows, form-
ing compact little companies, while the Adjutant rides about
on a horse and calls us the most striking names he can
think of. And, to do him justice, we deserve them, at the

be finished soldiers, but, at least, we know (or think we do)
as much about the new drill—well, as our officers.
The rest of the day—day after day for the whole week—
is made up of meals and manoeuvres, during which last we
look more than ever like ants as we crawl about the hill-
side, scattered rows of little dots, firing at foes which are
invisible with cartridges which are blank; and as we crawl
and lie and double (though it's ill doubling with an aching
stomach), I console myself with the thought that though
each little individual ant seems rather ineffective, it takes
a brave man to put his hand into a nest of them. And,
having gone to the ants myself, I appeal with some con-
fidence to the sluggards who still form the majority of the
population, to follow my example, and consider their ways.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,—I have had a funny little print put
into my hands. It calls itself The Protest, a Journal for
Philistines. Methinks it doth protest too much. It saya
that it starts this month with a " Growthful Idea," and its
"Great Hope is to keep young, bright and protestful."
Oh why did the Westminster invent that hideous word
"pushful" for the contamination of the unfledged? You
will be greatly shaken, Mr. Punch, to hear that The Protest
considers that you lack the Sense of Humour. It says:
"Don't read The Protest if you suffer from Insomnia: read
Punch." Personally, I do not suffer from Insomnia, but 1
am nevertheless tempted to follow this advice.
I am always a little sorry (especially when they show, as
here, a distinct promise) to see the very young journals start
in this kind of key: because it is recognised, in the profes-
sion, as the sure sign of impending fiasco. Let us hope that
our young friends will survive this early fault, and ponder the
words of THACKERAY (although he belonged to your Round
Table) where he reflects upon the young Esmond's affecta-
tion, and says, "We grow simpler as ice grow older."
Yours, dear Mr. Punch,
ONE OF THE ELECT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OPEN "VELDT."
(A South African Story; as told in the
sixpenny monthly magazines.)
By "Col. D. STREAMER."
IT was nearly six o'clock on a warm
evening in June when PIET GABRIEL VAN
DER BEZEIDEVHOUT, of Pifflekop, returned
to the desirable family kraal which had
been the home of his ancestors ever
since the days of the Great Trek.
In the distance the chimes of the
Dutch Reformed Church of Spoofburg
were anxiously summoning worshippers
to Biltong, as evensong is called in this
country, the loud disselboom echoing
pleasantly across the lofty snow-capped
spruits, and losing itself in many a
deep sheltered ferante where the kop (or
native policeman) watered his flock of
patient dongas, and the timid bles-bok
hopped from twig to twig among the
Cape-gooseberries.
Outside, upon the open veldt, PIET
GABRIEL could hear the amorous merecat
calling to his mate from the branches
of some fragrant mimosa bush, while
the occasional growl of an ant-bear gave
evidence that one of these alluring little
creatures was engaged upon its nightly
avocation with as fond a hope of success
as the obedient sluggard of the proverb.
Fortune had proved singularly favour-
able to PIET of late. His prickly-pear
harvest promised to be a more than
usually good one, and the tall mealie
trees that cast their welcome shadows
on his "lands" were already heavy
with luscious fruit.
He flung down the armful of carbines
of which he had that very afternoon
relieved a too - confiding Yeomanry
patrol, and sat down to his evening
meal with a hungry smile.
After a frugal repast of home-made
Vddtsehoen, washed down by a tankard
of the light Karroo of the country, PIET
drew an empty packing-case to the grand
piano (but lately left behind by a Flying
Column of the enemy, and now the
chief piece of furniture in the room),
and began to sing that well-known
ballad entitled:—" 0, MARY, go and
call the trek-ox home, across the sands
of De-Aar!"
He was then about to attempt a simple
ditty which he had picked up from an
adjacent blockhouse, with the well-
known refrain of "TOMMY, put the
kettle on, and we '11 all have condensed
milk!" when a beautiful type of early
Dutch maiden, weighing some seventeen
stone in her hat, burst into the room.
Her face wore a look of wild alarm,
and yet left sufficient space for the
display (if necessary) of several other
expressions.
"Volkslied !" she exclaimed, in the
patois of the Colony.

ONE OF "LIFE'S LITTLE IRONIES.'
"Rooineks?" was PIET'S not un-
natural query, as he scratched his head
with a puzzled air and an explosive
bullet.
"Donkerhoek, aasvogel!" she retorted
with quiet dignity; and not till then
did PIET understand the full import of
her warning.
Realising too late that his house was
surrounded by the hated "Khakis," he
hurriedly concealed the tell-tale carbines
in the grand piano, which, in its turn,
was hidden from view by a dozen wooden
champagne cases labelled "Hospital
Comforts," attached a white flag (of
which he possessed a varied assortment) j
to his knob-keny, and, thoroughly ex- j
pecting every moment to be his next,
seized a bottle of Imperial Boot Polish
(Advt.) from an adjacent cupboard, and
divested himself of all his clothes but
two.
To black bis body all over was the
work of an instant, and when a dis-
gusted British Colonel of Militia entered
the room a moment later, it was to find
a trembling Kaffir sitting in the place
of the notorious rebel whom he sought
so anxiously.
'• Dop!" exclaimed the Colonel, who
was noted for his felicitous choice of
expletives. Then, turning angrily upon
the inmates of the room, "What on
earth did they want to drag me into
this business for? " he asked.
"Kopje!" replied PIET GABRIEL
BEZEIDENHOUT, which really summed up
the situation with remarkable lucidity.

MR. PUNCH'S SKETCHY
INTERVIEWS.
IV.—Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, M.P.
WE found Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL
before the pier-glass in the midst of
remarking, "Yes, men of Oldham."
He turned as we entered, observing that
he would not be long: he had only the
peroration to deliver. This he dis-
charged into the receiver of a phono-
graph for future reference.
He then removed the pebble from his
mouth and with pardonable pride
directed my attention to a stuffed vul-
ture of singularly noble physiognomy.
"Is it the vulture?" we asked.
"None other," he said with a sigh.
"It never got over my escape, and died
in great agony shortly afterwards. The

taxidermist, a man of great penetration,
pronounced its heart broken, a unique

Spectator does record an instance of a

a pelican. I am writing a little memoir
for the Natural History Museum at RAY
LANKESTER'S request. The people of
Durban presented me with the bird,
stuffed. South Africa is indeed the
land of gratitude."
We admired the bird, and contrasted
its noble conduct with that of the
vulture which preyed on the vitals of
PROMETHEUS.
"Yes," said Mr. CHURCHILL, after
musically chanting some lines from
^Eschylus, "it never told its love.
Major POND wants me to send it to
America as a sort of advance agent for
my next lecture tour, but I can't spare
it, and yet I hardly like to refuse. A

yet I am bound to cross the Pond."
"What are your new subjects?"
"The House of Commons—and its
reform. The British Army—and its
reform. The British Navy—and its
reform. The Universe— and its reform.
Noticing by his side a morocco-bound
copy of Savrola, we asked Mr. CHURCHILL
if it was true that his American name-
sake had actually asked him to change
his name.
"The Americans," remarked Mr.
CHURCHILL oracularly, "are a great
nation."
Baffled at this point, we asked our
Admirable CRICHTON if he were writing
another romance.
"

'The dutiai of confidential adviser to Lord
Robert* are not light."
"Ah !" he said darkly.
"But surely you would not stop at
one?" we protested. "BEACONS-
FIELD"
"I have many projects," he broke in,
"and time is snort. The duties of
confidential adviser to Lord ROBERTS are
not light. ROOSEVELT is impetuous and
has to be constantly held in check."
Here Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL signifi-
cantly drew on a pair of boxing-gloves.
"Oldham's claims are neither few nor
insignificant. There are the articles on
Oratory, Strategy and Tactics, that I have
undertaken to write for the Supplement

He sighed, but was quickly his
boyish self once more. Turning a com-
plete back somersault he alighted with
deft dexterity on his feet in a fighting
attitude,
"That's how I fetch Oldham," he
exclaimed with a ringing laugh. And
we left him still equipped with the
boxing-gloves in which he invariably
writes his lectures.

ATHLETES AT BOW STREET.
IV.
M. SANTOS DDMONT, aeronaut, was
charged in the interests of the atmo-
sphere with the serious offence of not
flying.
Mr. HENRY BIRD, who appeared for
the prosecution, said that the case was
a bad one. M. SANTOS DUMONT, although
gifted with the extraordinary power of
controlling an aerial machine, spent
all his days in no longer using it. So
far from flying at the present time, he
had been found in a South - Eastern
train. He announced a flight from the
Crystal Palace round St. Paul's and
back again, but it did not come off. He
crossed to America to fly, and returned
without having left the earth. It was
an injustice to the atmosphere, and
serious damages were claimed.
Mr. H. G. WELL8, called for the prose-
cution, said that certainly a man who
could fly ought to fly. It ought to be
made criminal for a man who could fly
to take a cab. Personally he was not
flighty, but he liked to think that his
books had been the cause of flight in
others.
Mr. JOHN SCOTT MOXTAGC, M.P., Editor
of The Car, said that it would be well
if the case was dropped. The need of
the present time was the development
of the automobile. M. SANTOS DUMONT,
by his fantastic tricks in mid air, was
dragging a red herring across the trail.
The more the prisoner didn't fly, the
happier he, the witness, would be.
The Right Hon. HENRY CHAPLIN, M.P.,
said that he couldn't think why he had
been called in this case. Nothing was
further from his capacity than flying.
The prisoner in his defence said that
circumstances had been against him.
He was always ready to fly; he lived
entirely on aerated bread and drank
nothing but soda water; but accidents
would happen. He went to the Crystal
Palace to fly, and someone ruined his
balloon; he proposed to fly round the
Campanile at Venice and it fell before
he could get there; he crossed to
America to fly, and found it a land of
sky-scrapers; moreover everyone was
fly "there.
He further promised that if the Bench
would let him off this time he really
would give English people the chance
of seeing him control his machine.
The Bench acquitted the prisoner,
ILLTTSTBATED ttUOTATIONS.
(One so seldom finds an Artist who realises the
poetic conception.)

THIRST,"
Stephen Phillips'* " Ulysses," Act I., Sc. 1.
regarding the charge as frivolous, on
the understanding that he would read
and report on Mr. HENRY JAMES'S new
novel, The Wings of the Dove.
Mr. GUY BOOTHBY, literary atlilete and
phonographer, was charged under the
Factories Act with overworking thir-
teen typewriters.
Mr. H. W. MASSINGHAM, Inspector of
Typewriters for the Royal Humane
Society, said that he had paid a surprise
visit to the prisoner's house. He found
him dictating serial stories into thirteen
phonographs, and descending to a lower
chamber found thirteen typists furiously
at work. Their machines were groaning
with pain; indeed, the shrieks uttered
by one of them, which, he afterwards
ascertained, was reproducing a hu-
morous yarn, were poignantly piercing.
On calling upon the prisoner to desist
from dictation, he was told that nothing
could check the divine afflatus before
dinner time. When that was reached
the machines were prostrated with
fatigue, and two or three of them were
quite hors de combat.
The prisoner, who looked the picture
of rude health, denied, in his defence,
that the typewriters were overworked.
He took his exercise that way, just as
some men rode horses or bicycles, and
others drove motors or played ping-pong.
The typewriters were devoted to him.
A young friend of his named MARY had
a Baa-lock lent her by the prisoner,
which followed her everywhere—even
to school. Happier typewriters than
his could not be found; the only sad
moments in the house were when he
had finished a novel and could not begin
another. These intervals were, however,
only of momentary duration.
Mr. A. P. WATT corroborated. He
said he had never seen more cheerful
machines than the prisoner's. The
noises heard by the inspector must have
been shrieks of delight.
Mr. MAX PEMBERTON said that he also
was a literary athlete. He did not
employ so many machines as the
prisoner, but he had six constantly at
work, yet they never complained. The
physique of a typewriter was far more
robust than the inspector supposed.
He had one quick-firing large-bore
machine that had fought with Reming-
ton's Scouts, and was now delighted
to assist the witness in giving awaiting
world the story of the roinantic adven-
tures of the captain of a Swiss sub-
marine at the bottom of one of the
canals of Mars.
The Rev. CLAUDIUS CLEAR stated that
no self-respecting man of letters could
dispense with labour-saving appliances.
Simultaneous sextuple reviewing was
quite impossible without resort to such
machinery. For his own part he pre-
ferred a Nicoll-plated free-wheel, driven
by a Kentish fire-engine.
Mr. ARTHUR SVMONS said that if a
Quarterly reviewer were fairly entitled
to write four reviews of the same book
he could not see why a novelist of so
fecund an imagination as Mr. GUY
BOOTHBY should not be allowed to em-
ploy thirteen, or even thirty, type-
writers. He had himself tried the
ambidextrous use of a stylograph, but
found it no longer equal to the task of
coping critically with the output of the
minor poets.
The Bench acquitted Mr. BOOTHBY of
cruelty, but ordered him to grant his
typewriters an eight-hours day.

UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT.
A CORRESPONDENT, who is an earnest
student of the police news, has been
deeply interested in the report of certain
proceedings at the North London Police
Court, where a lawyer argued that such
an expert thief as his client would not
steal an eighteen penny clock. After
searching in the Law Reports he is
enabled, in the following extract, to
furnish a precedent for this line of
argument:—
Counsel, addressing the jury, repre-
sented the absurdity of accusing the
unprincipled wretch (whom he was
ashamed to be defending) of breaking
into a church after evening service and
stealing the collection. A. man with
his record flew at higher game than
that. He had burnt down an orphan-
age in 1881, and, though acquitted of
forgery in Australia on a technical
point (he could neither read nor write),
was known to have shot a police in-
spector a year later.
Incidentally, he could prove an alibi;
his client was breaking into a Bank
fifty miles away at the time. But, even
assuming that he was sober so late in
the evening—a large assumption—would
a really smart man • (gratified blush
from the prisoner, which was instantly
suppressed), who could • escape from
Newgate and blow up an arsenal, be in
want of a beggarly church collection?
To sum up, the prisoner was too bad
to have committed the crime — this
crime. True, he had owned to his
guilt on being arrested, but he implored
the intelligent gentlemen in the jury-
box to place no reliance on the word of
a perjured
Here the jury stated that they had
heard enough, and acquitted the
prisoner, who left the Court without a
stain on his character.

TRANSATLANTIC ICEBERGS.
THE Americans who visit Yewrope
appear to be of two kinds—the noisy
and the quiet. It may be that the
tranquil ones come from the New Eng-
land States, and the hustling ones from
Chicago and the great West. However
this may be, one's first impulse would
be to associate with the quiet people.
The squeaking, screaming, nasal con-
v-rsation of the others is insupportable.
No doubt their raucous voices distress
the placid Americans also, and prompt
some of the latter to speak so softly that
their murmured words become absolutely
inaudible. I doubt if anyone anywhere
speaks in as low a tone. The London
physician's bedside voice is a shout
compared to it. After the vigorous
conversation of French or Germans or
ordinary Americans, this soft whisper
is as soothing as the ripple of a
stream against moss. But a stay of
some days in an hotel full of unduly
quiet people seems like a temporary
sojourn in a tomb.
There is one such at Heidelberg, an
excellent hotel high up in the fresh air
above the Castle, where recently I dis-
covered more of the very tranquil
Americans than I had ever met before.
"Met" is not the word. One might
stay there for a month, and sit every
evening in the smoking-room with the
same men, and never "meet" them.
Also one would never hear them. One
would only see them, as one might see
some marble statues in a conservatory.
As for the ladies, young and pretty, or
middle - aged and — let us say, with
complexions less pleasing—they main-
tained a still more discreet silence.

They never spoke to male strangers,
naturally, or even female strangers.
They never spoke to the other American
ladies, and they hardly ever spoke to
the members of their own party.
I have to lament one unfortunate
indiscretion on my part. In a large
room intended for smoking, and pro-
vided with a piano used by the ladies,
two of the glacial American girls,
guarded by their frigid friends, were
playing one day at ping-pong. I was
wading through a German newspaper
and they came and played close to me.
Curiously enough, instead of having
some superlatively silent racquets, made
perhaps of petrified cotton wool, they
used the worst kind, producing the
original horrid, irritating noise of that
despicable game. As I read on, gradu-
ally reaching the verbs at the end of
each journalistic sentence, I became
aware that the noise ceased, and I dis-
covered that the ball was under my
chair. Without reflecting that I had
never been introduced, I picked up that
ball and handed it to the American
girl. I did not speak, I did not look
'•er, I merely bowed respectfully.
Yet after that indiscreet intrusion she
and her friends always glared at me—
if "glared" describes the aspect of
icebergs—as at a dreadful Englishman,
who might after a month say "Good
morning '' to her poppa.
It was pleasant, among these gloomy
travellers, to meet a cultured Parisian
family, whose charming good manners
did not prevent them from smiling or
speaking. They spoke audibly, though
softly, and, again unlike the Americans,
they appeared to take an intelligent
interest in everything.
Once only they seemed depressed.
They returned to the hotel one evening
and sat silent for a time, and then, one
by one, Madame, Mademoiselle, Mon-
sieur, and the son, gravely wished me
"Bon soir," and vanished.
"Can it be," I thought, "that this
family, so gay, so charming, has at last
been frozen by the American atmos-
phere? Shall I return to England a
sort of snow man?"
The next morning it was all explained.
"Nous etions dbrutis," said Monsieur,
"nous sommes allea dansun restaurant
allemand manger un vrai Abendessen."
Of course at our German hotel the
excellent cook served up no German
dish of any kind. Everything he gave
us was French or English. Like all
enthusiasts, the French family had gone
to the extreme. They had not tried a
Kalter Aufschnitt, because they were
already acquainted with mandes froides
assorties; for the same reason they had
avoided Rheln Salm and Forellen; they
had rejected a Griiner Salat, which was
merely a salade de laltue; and they
had not been tempted to eat some
macedoine de fruits, although it was
called a Oemlschter Kompot. And on
that occasion good white German wine
was not for them, since it is really not
so very unlike Graves or Chablis.
Determined to have something entirely
new, they had boldly attacked a supper
which no German would attempt. They
had eaten Schinkenbrot, and Wurat, and
Kartoffelnaolat, and Sauerkraut, and
Pfannkuchen, and Schicarzbrot, and
Pumpernickel, and each one of them
had drunk two^Jarge glasses of Munich
beer. It was all such a change from
Paris; you could get none of those
things chez PAILLAHD, or at the Cafe de
Paris; they had never eaten such a
supper before— and Heaven forbid they
should ever eat such a one again!
The next day they went on to Bay-
reuth, and left me, though not for
many hours, alone in the silence of the
American icebergs.

For your sake I became the prey
Of cabmen, porters, flymen;

MR. SEDDON has left us. At the
moment of departure he sent a letter of
thanks to the Editor of the Daily Mail,
referring to that organ as a "valuable
paper." This was duly published. But
as a similar testimonial appeared in the
Daily Express, we are still left in doubt
as to the relative places occupied in the
Great Man's estimation by these two
leaders of public thought.
A man at Colchester named TOLL
confessed to the murder of an American
at Kansas City. The American authori-
ties were communicated with, and they
cabled back, "Extension of TOLL not

dition," or do they suppose we still
torture our prisoners on the rack?
At Werchoturskoje a coachman was
savagely assaulted by a man with a red

seven men were accordingly thrown into
prison, which then caught fire.

THE BRITISH ASS SPEAKS OUT.
[At the opening Congress of the BritUh Association, Professor DBWA.R in
his Presidential speech attributed the commercial decline of England to a
scandalous economy in technical education. It should be said that the
Profemor is not to be confused with the Sir THOMAS DKWAR who collaborated
with Mr. DAN LENO in arranging a Comic Charity Cricket Match, played on
the tame date, at the Oval.]
AT Belfast, where the orange blooms,
The world has fixed its eye on
The portent of the " British Ass"
Assembled in a solid mass
To coach the British Lion.
I scan the President his speech:
How pertinent, how true are
The homilies he utters there—
Greatest (but one) of all who wear
The honoured name of DEWAR.
He laid a facile finger on
The points that most concern us;
Naming the faults we ought to cure
If we would stay our swift but sure
Descent to sheer Avernus.
He weighed the case as one who probes
The germ of epidemics;
And scathingly exposed the cue
To Britain's fall: the thing is due
To disregard of chemics!
Touching the wide commercial worth
Of alkali and acid
He found our training sadly crude,
But, worse than this, our attitude
Was criminally placid.
Take coal-tar. How can patriots mark
With undisturbed emotions
To what a scientific pitch
The Germans raise its use, so rich
In dyes and smells and potions?
These Teutons filch our industries
As fast as we invent 'em;
Our total skill in chemic lore
Compared with theirs is little more
Than thirty-three per centum!
Our lavish rivals look beyond
To-day and many morrows;
CARKEGIE'S Institute sustains
A system for "collecting brains"
Like butterflies or Corots.
Meanwhile we squander year by year
On secular researches
Largesse enough almost to keep
(Bought by the gross you get them cheap)
Our infant schools in birches!
And so the others pass us by
Knee-deep in mere stagnation,
Still haggling over wordy views—

On cleric " Education." 0. S.
WE learn from the Sunderland Daily Echo that "the
publishing firm of WORMSER, of Amsterdam, announces that
it will publish General DE WET'S boot in a few months'

whom he so constantly showed a clean pair of heels.
AN UNFINISHED COLLECTION.
A SILENCE had fallen upon the smoking-room. The
warrior just back from the front had enquired after GEORGE
VAKDERPOOP, and we, who knew that GEORGE'S gentle spirit
had, to use a metaphor after his own heart, long since been
withdrawn from circulation, were feeling uncomfortable and
wondering how to break the news.
SMITHSON is our specialist in tact, and we looked to him to
be spokesman.
"GEORGE," said SMITHSOX at last, "the late GEORGE
VAKDERPOOP ''
"Late !" exclaimed the warrior; "is he dead?"
"As any doornail," replied SMITHSON sadly. "Perhaps
you would care to hear the story. It is sad, but interesting.
You may recollect that, when you sailed, he was starting his
journalistic career. For a young writer he had done remark-
ably well. The Daily Telephone had printed two of his
contributions to their correspondence column, and a bright
pen picture of his, describing how LEE'S Lozenges for the
Liver had snatched him from almost certain death, had
quite a vogue. LEE, I believe, actually commissioned him
to do a series on the subject."
"Well? "said the warrior.
"Well, he was, as I say, prospering very fairly, when in
an unlucky moment he began to make a collection of
editorial rejection forms. He had always been a somewhat
easy prey to scourges of that description. But when he had
passed safely through a sharp attack of Philatelism and a
rather nasty bout of Autographomania, everyone hoped and
believed that he had turned the corner. The progress of
his last illness was very rapid. Within a year he wanted
but one specimen to make the complete set. This was the
one published from the offices of the Serutinizer. All the
rest he had obtained with the greatest easn. I remember
his telling me that a single short story of his, called The
Vengeance of Vera Dalrymple, had been instrumental in
securing no less than thirty perfect specimens. Poor
GEORGE! I was with him when he made his first attempt
on the Scrutinizer. He hads baited his hook with an essay
on Evolution. He read me one or two passages from it. I
stopped him at the third paragraph, and congratulated him
in advance, little thinking that it was sympathy rather than
congratulations that he needed. When I saw him a week
afterwards he was looking haggard. I questioned him, and
by slow degrees drew out the story. The article on Evolu-
tion had been printed.
"' Never say die, GEORGE,' I said. 'Send them Yera
Dalrymple. No paper can take that.'
"He sent it. The Scrutinize!-, which had been running
for nearly a century without publishing a line of fiction,
took it and asked for more. It was as if there were an
editorial conspiracy against him."
"Well?" said the man of war.
"Then," said SMITHSON, " GEORGE pulled himself together.
He wrote a parody of 'llie Minstrel BOT/.' I have seen a
good many parodies, but never such a parody as that. By
return of post came a long envelope bearing the crest of
the Scrutinizer. 'At last,' he said, as he tore it
"' GEORGE, old man,' I said, 'your hand.'
"He looked at me a full minute. Then with a horrible,
mirthless laugh he fell to the ground, and expired almost
instantly. You will readily guess what killed him. The
poem had been returned, but without a rejection form!"
Mr. DAVITT has condemned the naming of potatoes after

THE THEATRICAL "PAR" OF

[" We may be at the outlet of a lamentable
period, in which the drama will decline, and
'. ritii-ism will usurp all the functions of entertain-
ment."—JJatly Chronicle.}
THE revival of Herod at His Majesty's
Theatre last night was rendered interest-
ing chiefly by reason of the appearance
of the dramatic critic of the Saturday
Review, who descended the steps of the
palace after the death of Aristobulus,
and to the huge delight of a large
audience, told both author and actors
precisely what he thought of them. At
the conclusion of what was a veritable
tour de force, the curtain was raised six
times in response to vociferous demands
for the artist, and the remainder of the
evening seemed comparatively flat and
unprofitable.
The most palpable hit in the new
pantomime of Sindbad the Sailor at the
Lane was made by Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER,

Miller (looking after Cydiat, who has a slight touch of motor mania). "WELL, TO BE SUR«!
THERE DO BE SOME MAIN IQNOBANT CHAPS our o' LONDON. 'E COMES 'EBB ASKIN' ME 'ow

who, during the transformation scene,
demonstrated to the complete satisfaction
of a crowded house the connection of
this particular myth with Scandinavian
legend. Notwithstanding the length of
the turn, the gifted performer was com-
pelled by the gallery to repeat it three
tunes, and the out-of-date harlequinade
was in consequence judiciously omitted
by the management.
The attractions of the Belle of New York
have been considerably strengthened by
the inclusion of Mr. CLEMENT SCOTT'S
name in the bill. An inimitable series
of entertaining reminiscences now takes
the place of the former absurd exhibi-
tion of whistling in the shop scene, and
much good advice is given as to the
dangers of the stage as a career. This
would doubtless have been even more
valuable a few years ago, when there
were still to be found young persons de-
sirous of becoming players, as was only
natural when the stage was not a mere
vehicle for the exposition of the critic's
art. We have, however, changed all
that. The ladies of the chorus, some
of whom may have had pasts going
back to the ancien regime, appeared
thoroughly to appreciate Mr. SCOTT'S
observations. They will be repeated
every evening until further notice, and
may be obtained, we are desired to
state, in an attractive cover, at all
railway stations, price one penny.

THE CANARY'S CHALLENGE.
FROM the far Harz his parents came:
He from his birth had learnt to tame
The longing wild, the deep delight
That spurs th' untutored bird to flight
Tip in the azure belts of air,
He knows not why, he recks not where,
But up and up above the ground,
And on and on, and round and round,
Till, tired, but at his own desire,
He stays his sudden flight of fire,
And floats and sways and checks his fall,
Then drops, a tiny feathered ball,
His notes of passion spent and spilled,
And all his eager quiverings stilled,
Down from his height, and so retrieves
His strength amid his sheltering leaves.
No fierce desire for freedom stirred
The little cage-born British bird.
Comfort he had, and soon resigned
The native wildness of his mind;
And, still contracting to his cage,
Forgot his ancient heritage,
His sires' untrammelled life forgot,
Forgot their airy flight, but not
The gift that erst had marked them free,
That kept him bound—their minstrelsy.
He was his home's delight, and grew
To love his master; and he knew
His gentle mistress and her care,
And kissed her lips and sang her fair.
GLADYS he loved, who served his needs,
And DORIS with her freight of seeds;
And oft he shook his trembling tongue
With note on note together strung,
Intent to greet in glad surprise
Sweet CICELY of the shining eyes.
And he was manumitted too
From his dear cage, and lit and flew
Out and about through all the room's
Expanse, a flash of yellow plumes.
Perched on a chair he would prolong
His pure ecstatic burst of song,
Then seek his master's hand, and then
Hop meekly to his cage again.
• * * •
They took him down one summer's day,
And bore him, cage and all, away,
Far from his lovea familiar home
To England's verge and o'er the foam.
Within the Custom-house the crowd
Was striving, jostling, talking loud:
Some talked in Anglo-French, and some
Talked English—nobody was dumb.
The porters of that seaport town
Banged each his load of luggage down;
Worn travellers, fumbling at the locks,
Opened a trunk, a bag, a box;
Costumed officials barred a path
To women voluble with wrath;
And boys were darting here and there,
And all was chaos and despair—
When on that crowd, in heat immersed,
Three clear cool notes of music burst.
A moment's pause, and then it thrilled
In one triumphant swell that, filled
The shed our throng was pent within :—
Oh, how it seemed to pierce the din
With rapier thrusts of melody;
The porters half forgot their fee,
And all the noise died down and seemed
Asleep, while still the bird-voice streamed
In sudden twists, in quivering twirls,
In rippling rows of liquid pearls,
Gushing, as in a thirsty land
A fountain splashes on the sand.
For a short space no sound was heard
But CICELY'S little captive bird
Who sang as if his heart must break,
With mere excess of trill and shake,
And flung the challenge of his notes
Defiant down the Frenchmen's throats.
He ceased; the clamour rose again,
And so at last we caught the train.
B. C. L,
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT is a long time since my Baronite read a novel of such
entrancing interest as The Twickenham Peerage (METHUES).
Mr. MARSH bases his plot on an incident as old as SHAKSPEARE'S
day. He pulls the strings so deftly that he makes the
worn-out topic live again with pristine vigour. My Baronite
never spoils a novelist's game by disclosing his plot. He
recommends the gentle reader to get the book and find it
out for himself. In addition to its breathless interest, it is
full of character and bubbling with fun.
The Vultures (SMITH, ELDER) are the diplomatic repre-
sentatives of England, France, and the United States. Mr.
SETON MERRIMAN bestows upon them this name in token of
their habits of foregathering in certain capitals whenever
war is imminent. With the assistance of Mr. CABTENOR,
representing Great Britain, M. DECLIN, France, and JOSEPH
P. MANGLES, U.S.A., Mr. MERRIMAN gives vivid pictures of
the condition of things in Warsaw, where order still reigns
under the iron heel of Russia. In accordance with his
excellent manner when planning a novel, he makes a
thorough study of the topography, history, and national
characteristics of the country in which the scene is set. In
this case it is Poland, and clear light is flashed upon life in
Warsaw. The princely house of BCKAPA, father, son, and
daughter, are admirable studies of character. But my
Baronite confesses he does not care for the three Vultures,
who are, or are designed to be, the principal personages
the story. They become a little tiresome with their
in
affectation of capacity for seeing through a ladder beyond
the range of ordinary ken. This is a conversation that
takes place. "An old traveller said, as he passed CABTENOR'S
table at the Club, 'The world must be quiet indeed, with
you here in London.' 'I am waiting,' replied CARTEXOR.
'What for?' 'I do not know,' he replied, placidly con-
tinuing his dinner." This sort of thing is repeated with
wearisome iteration. It was done in real life once for all,
and much better, in the case of a lady still alive, whom
many of us know. Seated by the side of DIZZY at the dinner
table, in critical times when Russia was threatening Con-
stantinople and British interposition was looked for, the
hostess, having discussed and settled the political situation,
said to her distinguished guest in thrilling whisper, "What
are you waiting for?" "I am waiting for you to pass the
mustard," said DIZZY. And, like CARTENOR, he ''placidly
continued his dinner." THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

A BUN MOT.
AT the Confectioners' and Bakers' Exhibition at Islington
the public were defrauded of much enjoyment by the
omission of several allied industries, which would have been
of the deepest interest. For instance, no attempt was made
to explain the properties of alum as an article of diet, though
its well-known heated fragrance gladdens many a neighbour-
hood when the ovens are opened of a morning. Another
strange oversight was of certain invariable ingredients (de-
scribed as "fruit" in the trade) contained in penny buns,
Bath buns, and scones. We refer to short lengths of stalk,
blackened skins, and stains of various colours, widely sup-
posed to be portions of currants, sultanas, or even raisins.
But the separation of the original crude fruit from the
"fruit" as presented to us by the baker clearly involves a
perfection of careful, mechanical skill that might well have
formed one of the chief attractions of the show.
May we express a hope that the above-named industries
will be included in the curriculum of the National School for
Bakers, recently opened at the Borough Polytechnic? Many
sacred institutions are being torn from us in these revolu-
tionary days; but the Englishman will not readily part with
the foods and refreshments of his youth.

"BOZ" AND BOULOGNE.
"Now," says the genial Chatelain de DARDELOT as we sit
at his table enjoying our coffee, chaese, and cigar, after an
excellent dejeuner a la fourcJiette accompanied by "the
generous" to which we three pilgrims, being thoroughly
conscientious, had done no more than strict justice—" I pro-
pose driving you to the pretty church at Condette, where you
will see on a tombstone an inscription that will specially inte-
rest you" (this to me), "as a member of 'The Boz Club.'"
. Kind Madame la Chatelaine was sure that there could not
be a better way than the one proposed of spending the
afternoon. One of her daughters, as well up as her father
in all the local traditions, would be of the party, while the
Chatelaine herself and another daughter, her " understudy,"
would await our return and welcome us with a "five
o'clock," meaning tea, et cetera, the latter being for those
who might prefer this variant in refreshments.
So with our Chatelain gaily driving a la francaise, with
cracking whip and (apparently to timid hearts) dangerously
loose reins, we, in a light waggonette and pair, one of us on
the box with our gallant coachman, and three in the open
well behind—which, being innocent of any doors, gave more
than one of the party an occasional chance of being left
"well behind " on the road—were triumphantly conducted
round all sorts of queer corners, skirting ditches yawning to
receive us, and projecting banks, now down on one side,
now up on the same side and down on the other, with "He
la-baa! " to a carrier's cart blocking up the way, until the
carrier himself, in the politest manner possible, emptied him-
self and the contents of his cart into a fosse, his courtesy
being acknowledged by the Chatelain with a cheery nod and
smile, and " Miile remerciments," until we were taken at a
sharp trot round a right-angled corner into a by-lane and
landed at the gate of an unoccupied house standing in its
own (or somebody else's) park-like grounds. No help re-
quired from groom or coachman, nor from a handy man
(there wasn't one) on the premises, as the Chatelain is pre-
pared for such emergencies, and suddenly produces from
somewhere a chain and a kind of rope halter, with which
our " steppers " are fixed up to a ring in the wall to be left
there till called for again by us. Beautifully situated is the
house, with lovely views, and a courtyard overshadowed by
a big tree in the centre, which must have been the counter-
part of the house that was in CHARLES DICKENS'S temporary
occupation on the other side, not the Condette side, of
Boulogne. But CHARLES DICKENS may have stopped at this
place for a short time before finally taking up his abode in
the country nearer to, and north-west of, Boulogne, where
he occupied a house on the Calais Road, "on the very
summit of the hill," with "a private road leading out to the
Column" (see Book vii, Life of Dickens, pp. 457-468).
Our host, having remounted his box and adroitly turned
the horses and carriage quickly and safely round in a space
wherein the unaccustomed eye would not have seen room
for the manreuvring of a small donkey-cart, we were con-
veyed at a sharp trot to the village, presumably of Condette,
where in the garden of the quaint old inn the landlord's
son keeps some half dozen falcons, which, with their red
hoods over their heads and their beaks and still sharper eyes,
conveyed the idea of a party of rich old miserly money-
lenders (queer birds these) on the look-out for something to
pounce on. They were very friendly, out of business hours,
while their owner exhibited them. We regretted being
unable to see the sport; but they were not going out that
day. Pleasantly saluted by hostess, host, and "PHILIP the
Falconer," a bright and intelligent youth their son, we
were then personally conducted to the Church and Terra
Sancta of Condette, which visit had been from the first le
bout de notre pelerinage.
The Church of St. Martin—again presumably so, since
there is an ancient statue here representing St. MARTIN on
horseback (the figures are, I think, of wood, and coloured)—
is as pretty and bright as heart of man could wish a simple
country church to be, scrupulously neat and clean, and
quite free from anything like that tawdriness of decoration
which, so frequently met with abroad, offends the peculiarly
English sense of the fitness of things. Then, taking us into
the graveyard of the church, our Chatelain silently and im-
pressively points to a square tomb of pure white stone, on
the face of which is the inscription here reproduced textu-
ellement:
"Id repose le corps de Monsieur Ferdinand Beaucourt,
Spouse de Francoise Mutuel. Ne & Bethune, Decide a Con-
dette Le 8 Mai 1881, a Vdge de 75 ans et 8 mois."
DICKENS knew this worthy gentleman from 1853 to 1856.
So it is likely that he may have changed his residence after
DICKENS had left, and have settled down at Condette. On
another side, at right angles to the above, is clearly cut the
following inscription:—
"Tlie Landlord of whom Charles Dickens icrote, ' I never
did see such a gentle, kind heart.'"
Here we stood for some time, each one of us liking rather
to meditate than to break the silence.
The sincerest thanks of our party are due to our Chatelain
et Chatelaine and their bright daughters who had arranged
for us so interesting a pilgrimage, and had so delightfully
carried it out. And the weather! Well, it was of all late
summer days the most glorious, and never was one more
enjoyable. And that, Mesdames et Messieurs, is the verdict
of us all here expressed by A PROGRESSING PILGRIM.
THE SONG OF THE DOUKHOBORS.
|" The Doukhobon, a colony of whom waB recently planted in Manitoba,
have abandoned the use of horses, cows, and all domestic animala, which they
refuse to keep in serritude."—Daily Paper.]
THE Doukhobors! The Doukliobors! Who does not yearn
to be
So absolutely uncontrolled—so fabulously free?
So potent are their principles, the zealous folk I sing
Extend the rights which they enjoy to every living thing.
The cows in that community no longer are subdued;
No dog among the Doukhobors remains in servitude.
With institutions of their own the creatures are content;
The marmosets have got a Mayor, the pigs a President;
The kittens, if you pull their tails, consult solicitors;
The very rabbits have their rights among the Doukhobors.
The Doukhobors! The Doukhobors! With their distinctive
views
They lend a new significance to words we often use.
If I were going to the dogs, I should not find it hard
To go where dogs enjoy the height of popular regard.
To call a Doukhobor an ass implies a compliment,
And sheepish looks improve a man, by general consent.
When ladies call each other "cat," in our domestic wars,
I like to think how sweet it sounds among the Doukhobors.
The Doukhobors! The Doukhobors! Consistent as they
are,
They go, perhaps, upon the whole, a little bit too far;
And though I've travelled many lands, from Hind to
Helsingfors,
I do not mean to try my luck among the Doukhobors.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS.
IX.—THESPIS ON WIRES.
IT was last night that we found the
tent on the green and read the placards.
We at once decided to come. SKILBECK
of Balliol, who is with me, has spent
to-day looking up details about mimetics
and the dithyramb. It is only the
prospect of this evening that has buoyed
us up all day. Saturday in this Hamp-
shire village has not been idyllic. It
has poured with rain since the early
morning; of the people in the inn the
most were drunk, and the rest cyclists,
which SKILBECK described as Scylla and
Charybdis. There was a third class—
the drunken cyclists, but that was of
no help in the situation. To read the
philosophy of KANT in a room above the
bar has been impossible; we have
shunned facing Scylla and Charybdis
in the coffee-room. But this evening
has come, and it should be some com-
pensation for the dulness of the day to
see a powerful travelling company in a
"Strong Representation of Drink."
We are glad to get inside the tent.
The walk through the mud from the
inn has been, considered as a dramatic
preparation, unfortunate. It is pleasur-
able, however, to find that we rank as
front-row plutocrats for sixpence. The
twopenny pit gape at us with awe-
struck curiosity. The overture has
begun: a five-year-old coon song on a
metallic piano. SKILBECK murmurs
triumphant references to the dithyramb.
The stage looks very small; apparently
it is a pigmy company. It should be a
unique experience to see them in
Drink. At last the curtain rises by
several stages, and we experience our
first emotion. It is a Marionette Show.
Act I. is in full swing. A wooden-
faced inebriate has left his wife and
child at home for the superior attractions
of the village inn, ably presided over
by a treble-jointed publican and his
falsetto son. The dialogue between the
three is instructive. The speakers
appear to be possessed by a desire for
temporary dismemberment; further-
more, whichever of the trio is for the
time being silent collapses against the
wall in an attitude suggestive of intoxi-
cated impotence. The moods and
passions of the speakers seem to produce
in them anatomical effects of the most
alarming nature; SKILBECK with difficulty
restrains his "pity and terror" on the
publican, in a fit of sudden joy, shed-
ding his left foot.
The publican's wife enters, and we
now see that her son's voice is an
inheritance. A flirtation ensues between
her and WOODEN-FACE, her husband and
son leaning helpless against the wall,
and watching the scene with comatose

He. "BUT I TOLD YOU TO MEET MB IN TH« SLIP CARRIAGE I"
She. "WELL, HOW WAS I TO KNOW -WHEREABOUTS IN THE TRAIN rr WOULD BE?"
apathy. Then enters WOODEN-FACE'S
wife—from her voice evidently a sister
of the publican's lady—and her rival
subsides against the wall beside her
drunken relatives. Mrs. WOODEN-FACE
implores her husband without effect to
return to his simple cottidge where his
little cheeild awites him. To them
comes a grey-faced clergyman with a
splay foot, and attempts to reclaim
WOODEN-FACE.
There is by now leaning against the
wall a row of no less than four charac-
ters in various stages of alcoholic excess.
They are joined—his temperance speech
concluded—by the minister; his col-
lapse is, if anything, more serious than
that of his wall-companions, for his
right leg is doubled into the small of
his back. The latest entrance is the
Cheeild; she has golden hair, and is
apparently suffering from small-pox.
This makes it hardly surprising that
WOODEN-FACE should resist her appeal—
an appeal to which the metallic piano
adds its persuasion—of
"Farver, dear Farver, cummome'"
But it cannot excuse him for projecting
a pint-pot along an obvious wire at his
offspring's head. The Cheeild falls,
and so does the curtain—by segments.
A countryman behind us is shaken by
a long dry sob.
Act II. in the dying Cheeild's l>ed-
chamber is affecting to a degree. The
Cheeild, with agitated convulsions of
her head and arms, announces with
some confidence to a row of intoxicated
mourners by the wall that she is going
to be an Angel, and is eventually at the
close of the scene borne to a blue
merino heaven in the arms of two
spasmodic Cherubim. The country-
man's sobs are by this time heartrend-
ing, and SKILBECK, leaning back, fails to
give him any comfort by the assurance

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
that he is merely undergoing an Aris-
totelian catharsis.
Act HI. is soon over. In it we see
WOODEN-FACE a reformed character—a
striking example of child-murder as a
cure for alcoholism. Integrity and
respectability combined are suggested
by a frock-coat, grey flannel shirt and
no collar. He is reconciled to his wife,
and, by the time the curtain works its
passage down again, there is every indi-
cation that he means for the future to
lead a better—if still a spasmodic—life.
With purified emotions we rise to
leave the tent. I cannot but feel that
the effect is about to be completely
marred when I see the owner of the
marionettes appear in proprid persona
before the curtain to conclude the enter-
tainment by singing a comic song. I
seize SKILBECK, apologetically seeking a
parallel in the satyric drama, and hurry
him out into the wet—not quite in time
to escape a last impression of a
melancholy-looking man in a greasy
dress suit, averring with a show of
nasal enthusiasm that when he goes out
on the hi-ti-ti it is a bit of all right.
OUR TOWN REGATTA.
I AM free to confess that I felt rather
flattered when I was asked to "come
on" the Committee of the Shrimpton
Town Regatta: I am equally free to
admit that my sense of exaltation did
not last very long. I did not know so
much about Regattas then as I do now.
We held our preliminary meeting in
the back parlour of "The Dog and
Dough-nut, Mr. JOHN WOPSLEY, the
local butcher, in the chair. This gentle-
man having called for, and partly con-
sumed, a pot of "four-'arf "—whatever
that mysterious liquid may be—opened
the proceedings by saying that Shrimp-
ton ought to do the thing in style, with
"no 'arf measures and no niggard
'and."
This, being purely academic and com-
mitting nobody to anything in particu-
lar, was received, as all such pious
expressions should be, with unstinted
applause.
Then we came down to cold detail,
and after two hours' discussion I reeled
faintly out of the awful atmosphere of
tobacco smoke and fumes of strong
drink, to breathe the pure night air
once more.
Several similar meetings followed,
and then at last came the great day.
I need hardly state that the elements
were not with us. On Regatta days it
is an almost invariable rule that the sea
should be choppy and the wind blow
hard. On this occasion it was also
remarkably cold.
We were adorned with red rosettes
and sent on board the Committee boat
early: far too early, I thought, as that
primitive craft jumped and rolled at
her moorings in a most uncomfortable
manner. I had brought a goodly supply
of sandwiches and tobacco with me,
but, somehow or other, I cared for none
of these things. "Once on board the
lug "—I mean Committee boat—they
seemed to lose all interest for me.
The first event was a swimmng race;
the competitors started from the
shore and made our boat the winning
post. I wished they had not done so,
as one candidate after another clambered
in and dripped all over our clothes.
There was an objection on the ground
that the winner was not qualified—the
second man, in liis excited protest,
waving his arms violently and spraying
the Committee liberally. We finally
pacified them by promising an extra
prize, to be provided out of our private
pockets. .
Then came a rowing contest. There
were cross objections here, and again
we resorted to the same cowardly
expedient, after Mr. WOPSLEY had taken
off his coat and threatened to fight the
first and second coupled.
We then received from the shore
an intimation that the Town Band de-
clined to play any longer unless an
extra fifteen shillings was guaranteed
them.-
The fun began to be fast and furious
when WOPSLEY inadvertently sat down
on the breach of the small signal gun
and "touched it off" with a terrific
report. Poor WOPSLEY was knocked
overboard by the recoil, whilst the
sailing boats moored in the Bay mis-
took the sound for the signal to start
their race.
They all broke out their jibs and
raced past the "imaginary line," but,
being taken unawares, such confusion
prevailed among them that, rounding
the Committee boat, the Saucy Soapsuds
missed stays, and ran right into the
devoted craft on which we were
"dreeing our weird."
What became of the rest of the
Committee, at the moment, I did
not know. I found myself clinging
frantically to the Soapsuds' bowsprit,
and being borne onward o'er the bound-
ing main at a perfectly awful rate. A
moment of horrible suspense, and then
strong hands—too strong hands—
grasped me by the slack of the trou—
by the waistband, and hauled me
aboard.
I looked up, expecting to find the
honest, kindly, brown-bearded faces
which sea-novel readers are always told
await them when rescued from the cruel
ocean's hungry jaws. But I saw in-
stead three young Cockneys in very dirty
"sweaters," glaring down at me over
their sunburned noses in a way which
made my blood run cold, and heard the
leader's brief address :—
"Garn, yer silly cuckoo! wodjer
mean by gettin' in our w'y an' spilin'
our chanst ter win? Y' ought to be
biled, blank yer, y' spindle-shanked
'umbug!"
I venture to say that I shall not be
found serving on the Committee of the
Shrimpton Town Regatta next season.
TO OUR TRUSTY FRIEND.
["It is rumoured that an American Building
Trust is to be formed, with a capit il of some sixty-
six million dollars, to take in hand the reconstruc-
tion of London."— Daily Paper.]
So, Uncle SAM, you 've cast your eye
On London's brick and stucco great-
ness,
And you propose a Trust should try
To lick it into up-to-dateness.
That's real kind; we feel you 've made
A truly neighbourly suggestion—
But have you adequately weighed
The difficulties of the question?
Say, are you sure that your Combine
(Or is it Combine ?) will be grounded
In all the classes of design
With which we love to be surrounded?
Can you, for instance, emulate
Our Ludgate Bridge's gorgeous gild-
ing,
Erect the Fleet Street Griffin's mate,
Or beat the Admiralty building?
Can you prepare us plans to rank
With British Art's supreme creations?
Could you have built the Birkbeck
Bank,
Or Paddington and King's Cross
Stations?
Will you, when decorating walls
(Like some with whom we 're well
acquainted),
Declare the frescoes in St. Paul's
Are not so bad as they are painted?
If so, we greet you—oh, but stay,
It's only right for us to mention
That others in the building way
Are giving us their best attention;
And so we fear you cannot come,
Unless the Trust that you announce '11
Put by a fairly handsome sum
To pension off the County Council.
The Red Earl (Conto Rosso).
OUR brilliant contemporary H Corriere
della Sera describes the London County
Council as:
"una specie di Coneiglio provincial?, che ha gil
adattato nel Gorerno della metropoli arditissime
riforme a vantaggio delle rlassi porere, rifotme
iniziate dal BUO primo presidente lord ROSEBEBY,
il quale all'epoca della sua amainistnizione si
acquistu il titolo di Conte Rosso, perchg gli si attri-
bmvano tendenze socialiste."
May we trace here a confusion with
Earl HERBERT SPENCER?

LITERARY RUMOURS.
Mr. Punch is glad to be able to sup-
lement the Publishers' Lists by the
| following preliminary notices, hitherto
crowded out owing to the rush of the
opening season:-
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, whose Confessions
of an Opinion-Eater has long been out
of print, is preparing for publication
before Christmas a novel entitled Tem-
porary Power: a Study in Supremacy.
The work, we understand, is to be dedi-
cated, without permission, to the Right
Hon. A. J. BALFour.
Lord CHARLES BERESFORD is engaged
upon a new edition of the History of
Selborne. The introduction will, it is
said, be. more strictly critical than
appreciative.
I sukken DER 111”
| Mr. R. W. Pears is still hard at work
upon his Tale of a Tube.
Lord RoSEBERY is at present enjoying
a retreat, having had a notable success
with his Tales of a Wayside Inn.
Mr. GERALD BALFour's new novel, The
History of Jonathan Very Wild, is to
be dedicated to Mr. PIERPONT MoRGAN,
as a mark of sympathy with him in the
want of success which has attended his
shipping enterprises.
General BoIHA's book will be entitled
Reitz and Wrongs of the Transvaal
War; while General DE WET has decided
to call his How to be Happy though
Harried.
The name of Mr. REITz's new work
clashes with that of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
though differing from it in the sub-title.
It is to be called Temporary Power; or
After the “Armistice.”
Still another edition of Shakspeare
is announced. This time it is the
“Empire” edition, the first volume of .
which will be Love's Labour's Lost,
with notes by Mr. JESSE Collings, M.P.
Amongst novels of the season likely to
be popular may be mentioned Mr. GIP-
son Bowl.Es’ Talky and Co., and The
Blast of the Barrons, by the defeated
candidate for Leeds.
There will shortly appear a new
volume of verse by Mr. H. ARNOLD-
FoRSTER entitled La Bellville sans
Merci, and other Poems.
THE CULT OF CULTURE.
[“The University Extension Lectures have this
year proved a greater success than ever.”—Daily
Paper.]
CULTURE! 'Twas the primal passion
Of ADOLPHUS, º
And he thrilled in strangest fashion
When that word he chanced to see.
What it meant, or what effected,
Little, little he suspected ;
How it was to be detected
Was a mystery, thought he ;
But he knew that, like a vulture
Famished, he was craving Culture,
Culture with a big, big C.
Slowly season followed season;
Still no nearer drew the goal,
Though he fancied feasts of reason
And imagined flows of soul.
Lighter joys he flouted. Wherefore
Maidens fair but foolish care for?
Love was not what he was there for,
Neither was the flowing bowl.
Still of things sublimer dreamt he-
Still, alas, he fasted empty,
Empty as a sideless hole.
Then by chance he heard one mention
That which filled his heart with glee-
University Extension
Lectures at a modest fee.
“Ha!” ADoLPHUs cried, delighted,
“Now shall all my wrongs be righted,
Nor shall ignorance benighted
Any more my fortune be.
I will read the golden pages
Of the Greek and Roman sages:
Sages are the men for me.”
So the lectures he attended,
With a note-book in his hand,
And ADOLPHUS comprehended
All that he could understand.
Now he's cultured, and with pride he's

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GNAT GAME.
THIS is a game for the hot summer nights. It combines
the pleasures and advantages of Patience, hunting, innocent
gambling, and acting in a farce. Tt is more difficult than
any known form of Patience, and the player is more often
defeated, but, like Patience, it requires only one player, and
ia therefore a great resource to the solitary. The hunting
element will be apparent later on. It has the excitement,
•without the sinfulness, of gambling, the stake being merely
a night's rest; very clever or very lucky players may some-
times win the whole; the opposite kind of players may lose the
whole, and there is any number of intermediate stages. As
for the farcical element, no player with any sense of humour |
can fail to perceive the exquisite irony and comicality of the j
whole business. This is especially striking when for any
reason, such as a difficult task to be performed the next
day, the stake is of exceptional importance to the player.
The apparatus is simple. The player wears a suit of pyjamas
—any colour or pattern will do—and must be supplied with
a candle and a box of matches, unless the bedroom where
the game is played is lighted with electricity—which is not
usual, as it is exclusively a country pastime—and with a
towel. Nothing else is needed, except the gnat. The
species required is not to be found everywhere, for the
common gnat is of little use. But low-lying districts in the
South of England, and more especially near the junction of
a river with the sea, can generally be relied upon to produce
the required gnat between the middle of July and the end
of September. It is of a comparatively large size, and its
hum and bite resemble those of the mosquito. [N.B. The
game can be played with the mosquito also, if the player
is willing not to handicap the insect with a mosquito
net. But the amusement is enjoyed at its best by the
unsuspecting, and we therefore confine the account to gnats.]
People with exceptionally good nerves and very heavy sleepers
are imsuited to the game. But for all others it provides a
pastime of absorbing interest. We can perhaps best give
an idea of it by describing a game actually played.
This game was played at a house in Sussex, in a valley
of the South Downs. The player repaired to his bedroom
at eleven P.M., tired with a long day's golf. He had to be
up betimes the next clay to get through some difficult legal
work in London, work for which a clear head and a quick
wit were necessary. He reflected that a good night's rest,
after the golf, would put him in that desirable condition.
This reflection marks the beginning of the game, being part
of its humour. He smiled with satisfaction as he looked at
the nice clean sheets. Kemembering that smile afterwards,
he shrieked at the irony of it. He was a rather nervous
person and a bad sleeper, but on this occasion he fell asleep
at once. He had been asleep about ten minutes, as he found
from his watch afterwards, when he was aroused by a loud
hum in his ear, and immediately afterwards by a prick on
his nose. He blushed his face with his hand and composed
himself again. The process was repeated at intervals of a
minute from 11.15 to 11.45. Then the player lit his candle
and looked for the gnat. [The score is now—gnat 1,
player 0. Every fresh manosuvre on the player's part counts
1 to the gnat; the death of the gnat counts 10 to the
?layer, its final expulsion from the room 5.] From 11.50 to
2.10 the player flicked about the room with a towel. Then,
the humming having ceased, he blew out the candle and
got into bed again. At 12.15 he was again aroused, and lit
the candle again. This time he walked stealthily round the
walls of the room with the candle in one hand and the towel
in the other. This part is always done, but is merely
formal, like the salute in fencing; the gnat never waits to
be squashed on a wall. At 1.5 the player tried a different
move, which was to flick the gnat out of the window, shut

ALL THAT LONO, DKEARY TIME, YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY IMAOKVK

the window at once, and be stuffy till morning. He flicked from
1.5 till 1.45, then the humming ceased, and he shut the win-
dow. Candle and bed as before. At 1.47 the humming recom-
menced, and he was bitten on the hand. 1.50 to 2.15, flick
and window as before. 2.15, candle and bed. Bite on lip.
2.17 to 2.40 flick and window. This series of moves was
repeated seven times between 2.45 and 4.5. At 4.5 two
sleepers in adjacent rooms, disturbed by the opening and
shutting of the window, commenced an amusing dialogue
out of their windows with the player. This is an interlude
which often adds to the charm and variety of the game. At
5.10 the gnat gave up, and the player lay awake, enjoying
the songs of the birds, distant coos, and so on, till he was
called.
In this game it was at first not certain if the gnat had
been expelled, because by 5.10 the room was full of light,
which has a quiescent effect on gnats. In such cases the
player counts 2£, so that the score would have been—player
2J, gnat 14. Later on, however, the gnat proved it had not
been expelled by biting the player in his bath. So the score
was—player 0, gnat 14. It is unnecessary to insist on the
variety and sporting character of this pastime. There is
scope in it for much ingenuity and acumen. And, above all,
it haa an excellent moral effect in teaching us self-control.
Swear-words count 1 each to the gnat.

LATTER-DAY FABLES.
n.
The Fable of the Young Lady who went
upon the Stage.
THERE was Once a Young Person
who yearned for the Triumphs of the
Stage. The Artistic Side of the Busi-
ness did not appeal to her, but she
thought the Whole Thing would be
Rather Nice. She lived in the Suburbs
with Mamma, and Papa, who was an
Elderly Company Promoter with a
funny Little Habit of Occasional Bank-
ruptcy and a New Brougham and Pair
directly after the Disclosures.
She put on one Side all thought of
Musical Comedy or SHAKSPEARE, and
determined that she would make a
Speciality of the Wicked Line of
Business. She would play the Lady
who was labelled CORAUE or FIFI, and
was sometimes a Cafd Chantant Person,
but More Often a Cosmopolitan
Countess with a Leaning to Cold Poison
in the Last Act. That of Course would
mean a Magnificent and Wriggly Death
Scene, with London at her Feet to-
Morrow Morning and an American Tour
to Follow. These Details of her Career
having been arranged she started to
look for an Engagement.
She heard from Papa, who met a
Man at the Club who knew the eminent
journalist and critic CLEMENT SCOTT,
that Mr. TREE was not at all Satisfied
with the Lady who was going to play
the Second Lead in his Next Produc-
tion. So ELVIRA (her Home Name was
really EMMA) wrote a Sweet and
Lengthy Letter to the Amiable TREE,
saying she was Sure she would do for
the Part, and when would he make an
Appointment for her to call? Also
could her Understudy play the Part on
Saturdays, as that was the Day she
wanted to go Round the Other Theatres?
And she didn't want any Salary, but
her Name, of course, must be on the
Programme Larger than anyone Else's.
She waited Two Days for an Answer,
and then, thinking there must be a
Mistake, called at the Stage Door and
nsked to see Mr. TREE. But the Stage
Door Keeper, who was used to this Sort
of Tiling, said that the Extra Ladies were
all Engaged, and if it was for Seats
there was no Free List. This annoyed
ELVIRA (who felt quite like EMMA just
then), and she went Home and
thought Seriously of writing to PINEHO
and asking him if there was a Second
Mrs. Tanqueray Part in his Next Play
and might she have It? But Papa,
who had just put a particularly Frosty
Mine on to the Market with Unparal-
leled Success, said No. He would Buy
her a Play, and she could give an
Afternoon Performance at a Disengaged

Theatre and so successfully smite the
Public without being under Obliga-
tions to Mr. BEERBOHM TREE or any of
Them. Now this was Rash of Papa, for
in his Middle-aged Youth, and before he
made Enough Money to attend Church
regularly, he belonged to a Club which
attended Trial Performances and said
Things Aloud about the Acting. Still
he meant Kindly, and gave ELVIRA (her
Home Name was EMMA) a Large Cheque
to go on with.
The Performance, celebrated on a
Foggy Afternoon, was not a notable
Success. As ELVIRA had Never been
on any Stage before she felt about
as Comfortable as a Cat in a Hot
Oven. She forgot her Words, and
the Stage Manager, who was a Cold-
Blooded Professional, rang down the
Curtain at the Request of the Manage-

ment, who feared there was going
to be a Riot. ELVIRA, who liad lost
the Hang of the Plot, hearing the
Tumult, wanted to go on and tell the
Audience that the Author was not in
the House, but that she would convey
to him their Favourable Verdict. She
was Dissuaded from this by the Advent
of Mamma, who exclaimed "My Poor
Child!" and folding her in a Loose
Wrapper shepherded her to the Dress-
ing Room. The Press Notices were
pithy, and Two of Them nearly tempted
ELVIRA (who almost wished she was
EMMA again) to Suicide with a Hairpin.
But a Sudden and Kindly Attack of
Influenza stayed her Hand, and when
she recovered the Papers had a big
American Blizzard to talk about, and
her Matine'e was a Back Number.
Then ELVIRA (who really was getting
Quite used to the Name) tried to obtain
Engagements to recite at the Ballad
Concerts like Mrs. KENDAL and Miss
HASBURY. But the Ballad Concerts were
unkinder even than Mr. TREE. They
wrote Back and asked for Press Notices
and what she had Done. ELVIRA could
not expose the Matinfe Remarks, so the
Ballad Concerts fell Through.
The Suburb grew quite interested in
ELVIRA (though they knew she was
EMMA), and after she had recited "Ring
out the False, ring in the True," at a
Midsummer School Tea began to ask
her when she would play in London, so
that they could go and see her. This
Friendly Interest woke up ELVIRA.
Through Papa, who knew the Hebrew
who was financing the Theatre, she at
Length obtained an Engagement. Per-
haps it was hardly the Leading Part,
but still it was an Engagement. It was
to Walk On in the Second Act and
drink Tea while the Principal People
said Clever Things in the Centre of the
Stage. And she Also understudied the
Maid who came on in the First Act and
said, "The Dressmaker is here, Mum."
So that ELVIRA became a Real Actress
at Last.
MORAL. — There wouldn't le any
Supers if everyone played leading
parts.
THE following statement has been
handed on to Mr. Punch by one of the
editors of a more favoured journal.

[The graceful Oriental practice of writing verses

PERSIA. The following translation of gome line*
scribbled on the back of a Hippodrome programme
do but scant justice to the delicacy and beauty of

So that a keen observer may
At any time espy

On London's many-postered walls.

That far above all else he sets

These bloodless ones, who reckon good
The sickliest sort of smoking, and
The feeblest form of food?
Their ancestors were ever ripe
For steak and pudding and a pipe.
A dismal prospect! Yet it's crossed
By one refulgent ray of hope;
No people can be wholly lost
That thinks so much of soap!
They must be washing off the grime
Of London nearly all the time.

CARTHAGO NOVISSIMA.
[The new naval base for M. PJJLLETAN'S " Holy War."]
NEAR Tunis (Northern Africa) there lies
In an extremely pleasant situation
That city's port, whose ultimate demise
CATO proposed with damned iteration;
Upon the site where MARIUS sat in pain—
Rebuilt by Rome and re-erased by Arabs—•
Silence and stark oblivion share their reign
With dusky bats and desultory scarabs.
This resume of Carthaginian lore
Is not advanced without sufficient reason;
Strange prodigies have struck the neighbouring shore,
Right in the centre of the silly season.
A sort of whale has just convulsed the scene
(Though "Punic faith" should still perhaps be
doubted);
It was the Minister of French Marine,
And this was, roughly, how the monster spouted :—
"Tunis! Refulgent replica of France,
That mother famed for her exotic daughters!
Well may you eye with proud and envied glance
Your graces reproduced in Gallic waters!
1 Gallic,' I say, for here we have a lake
Locked and patrolled by our defiant cruisers,
Where you enjoy, with power to bind or break,
Me and my mates as your offensive bruisers.
"Here I foresee another Carthage rise,
Like that persistent fowl, the fabled Phoenix,
A ' sanatorium ' of war-supplies
Run on the lines of modern hygienics; •
French, by the memory of that amorous pyre
Which she, the late lamented DIDO, died on,
It shall transcend the purple fame of Tyre
And have, I hope, an extra touch of Sidon.
"Using this base, from which to work the foam
And flaunt our flag in every creek and cranny,
We will, if necessary, humble Rome,
Repeating history with a naval Cannse;
While, as for Albion—through this Midland Sea,
Imperviously corked like bottled soda,
We '11 bar her passage; this, I think, should be
A fitting way of wiping out Fashoda!
"Now that a smart campaign, superbly planned,
Has proved our strength against Religious Orders,
The hour is ripe for us to put in hand
Another Holy War, beyond our borders;
Where France, the fount-of sweetness and of light,
A female Jove triumphant over Saturn,
Shall dissipate the brutal powers of night,
Largely constructed on the German pattern.
o s t> o e-
"The simplest words, if one but twist their sense,
Tend to disturb the European status;
Yet I have contemplated no offence
During my fit of maritime afflatus;
There's Italy, an independent race
That has for me a singular attraction—
I could not bear to think that she should trace
In my remarks one whiff of warlike action.
"Republican by choice, and deeply read
In doctrines based upon the Reign of Terror,
My patriot's heart may possibly have led
My Ministerial judgment into error:—
I must consider well what I'm about
Lest I should rudely shock ce cher DELCASSE,
And he should freeze me, ere my time is out,
Into the semblance of a marin glact." 0. S.
OUR BOOKING OFFICE.
MY Baronite is not surprised to find The Influence o/
Mars (GRANT RICHARDS) in its second edition. It is likely to
go much further. In planning her work Mrs. ANSTRUTHER
has been inspired by a happy thought. Whilst other pens
have dealt with the Transvaal War amid the' clash of arms
and the varying courses of the Titanic struggle, she has
made a study of its influence in home circles. Her range
is a wide one, embracing all classes of domesticity, from the
drawing-room to the kitchen. She is at home with the
denizens of either sphere. Martha, the little maid, seated
on the edge of the kitchen table twisting the corner of her
apron, bereft of her Jim, fallen in battle, is as real as is the
country squire with the town house who volunteers for
service in the Yeomanry and is rejected on account of fell
disease, warranted to carry him off in six months. Mrs.
ANSTRUTHER tells her stories with a literary style the
perfection of which is reminiscent of French art. An
irritating trick of purposelessly introducing rows of asterisks
at the end of innocent sentences cannot spoil the pleasure of
the reading. But it is worth her forgetting. She has the
gift of conveying a life story in a couple of sentences:
"Then Mrs. GEBKY laughed Toi» was one of thn moot annoying things
about her. She laughed always So many things amused her in which her
husband saw no humour whatsoever."
Here is a dire tragedy of common life — the vivacious
woman with a keen sense of humour, and the dull-brained
man who can see nothing to laugh at.
Dr. BREWER is dead, but his works do follow him in new
editions of his invaluable Reader's Handbook. Messrs.
CHATTO AND WINDI'S have just issued one painstaking edition.
It is something less bulky than its predecessors, but nothing
of prime value has been omitted, whilst some new matter is
added. It is one of the books of reference my Baronite
treasures on an accessible shelf.
In A Son of Gad (Hi'TCHiNSON) Mr. STEUART, designing to
compound a novel, brings to hand some familiar ingredients.
There is the proxid but poverty-stricken Scottish chieftain,
whose castellated home has passed into the hands of the rich
American. The rich American has a pretty daughter; the
chieftain has a high-spirited, noble-minded son. The son
wants to marry the daughter, but she is rich and he is poor,
so he will have none of it. The obvious follows. The
millionaire smashes up; the chieftain's son, whom he has
put in the way of some good things, has grown rich; he
buys back the castle of his fathers and lives happy evermore
with the daughter of the temporarily impoverished million-
aire. There are -other details, including the faithful but
gruff retainer w)ko starves himself in order to help his old
master. These tilings are useful in theirway. But my Baronite
finds something more is necessary to make a good story.
The Sheep Stcalers (HEIXEifAKHJ breaks fresh ground, and
VIOLET JACOB tills it with exceeding vigour and success.
The scene is set in the Wye Valley in the earlier half of last
century. It deals with the Rebecca riots, introducing the
reader to quite a multitude of life and blood characters,
habited in their daily apparel, conversing in their ordinary
way. My Baronite is not quite sure whether the author be
man or woman. When describing female apparel he thinks
it must be a woman; when a horse is being dealt with he
"spies a man's peard beneath the muffler." However that
be, the work is admirably done, adding fresh zest to the
palled "appetite of the way-worn novel reader.

THE LATEST JOURNALISTIC
ADVERTISEMENT.
(As managed in France.)
Two rival French newspapers, the
Matin and the Journal, have recently
distributed gifts to their readers. The
Matin began it in July. Instead of
spending fifty or a hundred thousand
francs in advertising a new feudleton
novel, it had the brilliant idea of giving
away presents, ranging in value down-
wards from a villa, completely furnished,
worth 18,000 francs, to its "Constant
Readers." At the beginning of this
month it announced that it had spent
140,000 francs, and the " Surprises du
Matin" were still dangled before the
eyes of an astonished world. The
Journal has of course been obliged to
follow suit.
Is it possible that this idea will cross
the Channel? Shall we have the
"Surprises of the "followed by
the "Presents of the "? Shall
we see distributors eagerly pressing
envelopes, containing orders for villas,
and carriages, and jewels, and so forth,
into the hands of tranquil citizens
arriving by the morning trains, or of
country people in market towns, or
even of those in obscure villages? It
would brighten the foggy days of
autumn, and bring happiness to many
a suburban home. At least it might.
Judging by the lengthy articles in
the Matin, the surprises are not always
appropriate. The rural postman, who
walks all day, might get the grand piano,
and the sedentary music-master might
be staggered by the possession of a
motor-car. A teetotaler would get the
dozen of champagne, and an old lady
receive the silver cigar-case. One would
never know one's luck. As for the
semi-detached villa at Brixton, it would
almost certainly go to a millionaire in
Park Lane, who would not know what
to do with it. However, he might give
it to his chaplain or his librarian.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SIR,—In No. EH. of his interesting and amusing Memories
of Older London, appearing in the Saturday Review, Sep-
tember 13, Mr. SHAND says, "In the old days the theatre was
the cheapest of rational amusements," and he goes on in the
same article to inform us that "five shillings was the price
of a stall." This may have been the price in "the old days,"
but in the days of the " Older London "—and it is of these
he is professedly writing—there were no stalls, either at
Drury Lane, Lyceum, Haymarket, Adelphi, at Punch's Play-
house (subsequently the Strand Theatre, where I, being then
a boy of about twelve, saw COMPTON as Perquillo), or at any
theatre, excepting always Her Majesty's during the Italian
Opera Season.
Well do I remember seeing, from my superior position in
the dress circle, the Lyceum pit crammed up to the orchestra
in order to witness the performance of CHARLES MATHEWS in
Patter v. Clatter, and of Madame VESTRIS and JCLIA ST.
GEORGE in one of PLANCHE'S Christmas-tide extravaganzas.
Of the prices for admission I cannot speak from personal
experience, as "in statu pupillari," between twelve and
fifteen, I was invariably " treated," but having had occasion
recently to consult some old "bills of the play," I think I
am not very wide of the mark in saying that the price of
admission to the dress circle was four shillings; five shillings
might have been the price of a seat in the first two rows;
and there was "half-price to all parts of the house" at nine
o'clock. When subsequently a few rows of stalls were
introduced between the orchestra and pit, the price of
admission to these was five shillings a stall, and to this select
part of the House there was no half-prioe.
Mr. SHAND'S estimate of "little KOBSON" is a pen pres
exact. ROBSON never could have been a tragedian. His
pathos was genuine; but his appreciation of tragedy was
so intense that he would have been utterly overpowered by
it and unable to act at all, had not his quick perception of
the ridiculous come to his instant relief, and then he, who,
a second before, had moved the house to tears or had
frightened it by his desperate intensity, was now the cause
of its "inextinguishable laughter." He was the perfect
embodiment of the very spirit of "Extravaganza," which
includes " burlesque," and has never had his equal.
Mr. SHAND'S memory plays him a trick when he mentions
the clever actor, "great for melodrama," as "DANIEL
WEBSTER." "Not DANIEL at all," as the unfortunate Mr.
Winkle tried to explain to the irascible little Mr. Justice
Stareleigh. DANIEL WEBSTER, candidate for the U.S. Presi-
dency and subsequently Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, is the one referred to in Bon Gaultier's Ballad of
The Snapping Turtle, when
"Winking first at CLAY and WEBSTBB"
the Judge awards the champion, the American St. George,
"The hundred dollars due you.
All in 1'ennsylviiumii bonds."
"And this," as the prologue says of Sir John Falstaff, "is
not he." Of course Mr. SHAND meant " BENJAMIN WEBSTER,"
popidarly known as " BEN WEBSTER," and briefly as " BEN."
And, a propos of " BEN," Mr. SHAND says of him that in his
(Mr. SHAND'S) memory, DANIEL WEBSTER was always asso-
ciated with The Oreen Bushes. "DANIEL" may have been,
but not " BEN." The Oreen Bushes (or, as they came to be
known, on account of the many years the piece remained an
"Adelphi favourite," "The Evergreen Bushes ") was a melo-
drama perennially popular at BEN WEBSTER'S theatre, it is true;
but it was not one in which the Manager himself played,
although he might have done so, on occasion, having been in
his time a versatile actor. Surely The Oreen Bushes recalls to
a playgoer of Mr. SHAND'S experience the names of Madame
CELESTE, Miss WOOLGAR, "TEDDY" WRIGHT, PAUL BEDFORD,
and the sepulchral 0. SMITH as the villain Black Murtagh.
After the theatre to EVANS'S. To this place of nocturnal
entertainment, long since swept out of existence by "the
Early Closing Hours " Act, I will not follow Mr. SHAND, but
on the threshold, pausing to bid him a good appetite for
supper, I venture to suggest to him that he is scarcely just
to PADDY GREEN'S exceptionally good choir of boys and men,
and that the ancient" Herr VON JOEL " was, " in consequence
of his long services, retained on the establishment," not" on
the strength of the establishment." Perhaps Mr. A. Lores
SHAND will have already detected and corrected his own
"slips " in such weighty details of absorbing interest, ere
this appears in print, writ by his very truly,
TRISTRAM.

AND so in ancient Oxford an office holds you fast;
You 've done with Dean and Tutor, and life begins at last.
Exams, are all behind you; you 've doffed your cap and

But still you 're up at Oxford, though lately you went down.
An architect! I bow, Sir, and, as I ply my pen,
The future parts before me and shows another WREN,
A WREN who once at Oxford was honoured with a blue,
Who rowed a race at Putney and much resembles you.
Ah, well, we '11 leave the future; the present has its pains:
My future WREN is busy with struts and joists and drains.
With fancied aisles and arches he fills his eager head,
Then leaves his dream-Cathedrals and sits and plans a shed.

I linger far from Oxford, but I shall see again
Some day that shining city with all her troop of men.
Fate may be blind and stubborn: it cannot keep me far
For ever from the Isis, for ever from the Cher.
And if good luck shall guide me to meet and greet you there
I '11 draw you, ay, and build you a castle in the air,
With towers and spires and ramparts and everything shown
plain
That makes a well-built castle as castles are in Spain.
So plan with rule and measure, and sometimes write to me
Who linger far from Oxford and look upon the sea,
The wild sea that divides us, and cannot bless the chance
That fixed you fast in Oxford and sent me off to France. R. C. L.

IT would seem that the Jabbergee type embraces certain
malign possibilities which Mr. ANSTEY'S charming wit has
either overlooked or ignored. For a really wanton display
of Oriental imagination in the handling of facts and figures
Mr. Punch has seen few performances to match the protest
of "A Calcutta Correspondent" against the " magnification"
of the VICEROY. Teeming with unconscious humour, it was
published, and taken quite seriously, by the Daily News
in a recent issue.
An Unsatisfactory Conclusion.
"COLON," says the Daily Mail, dealing with Venezuelan
affairs, "is the terminus of the Panama Railway." Mr.
Punch does not want to appear punctilious, but he thinks it
ought to end with a Full Stop.

MR. PUNCH'S SKETCHY
INTERVIEWS.
V.—Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPS.
I POUND Mr. PHILLIPS nodding over
Homer. His apartment is charming,

"My favourite part was the Ghost in Hamlet."
reflecting its owner's tastes at every
turn. A portrait of Mr. ARTHUR SYMONS
hangs over the mantelpiece, a pendant
to The Stoning of Stephen, after CARLO
DOLCE. The poet as he welcomed me
toyed with a paper-knife, the handle of
which was carved into the resemblance of
Mr. SIDNEY COLVTN, a very chaste article.
Cigarettes and refreshments stood on a
handsome Haymarquetrie table, a gift
from Mr. TREE.
"You are tired?" I said.
"A little drowsy, that is all," Mr.
PHILLIPS replied in his deep, resonant
22-H.P. voice. "You see I never sleep
at night, but occasionally, like HOMER
here, I nod by day. By the way, it is
odd that no one piits forth the Land of
Nod as HOMER'S birthplace."
I laughed. Mr. PHILLIPS, as a wit,
has yet to be recognised; but good
things drop from him continually.
"Do you ever regret the stage?" I
asked.
"Never," he said. "But I was suc-
cessful, successful. My favourite part
was the Ghost in Hamlet. Ah, if all
ghosts walked, to use a technicality of
my former profession, as regularly as I
did.!"
The topic was a painful one, and the
poet's fine eyes filled with tears of
sympathy for less favoured Thespians.
I hastened to change the subject.
"How do you do vour work?" I
asked. "The readers of 'Mr. Punch's
Sketchy Interviews' are dying to know."
"I compose best on the type-writer,"
he said. "A Bar-Yost, free-wheel. I
bought it cheap from the Orthopcedic
Hospital, which may account for some
of the criticisms of my metre. It's a
wonderful worker, good stepping action,
but when it takes the bit between its
teeth, I 'm done. That "s when those
long soliloquies get in."
"Don't you, get fearfully tired?" I
remarked.
'• Oh yes, but then I take plenty of
exercise. I adore ping-pong. But cricket
is my true vocation. When things
come to the worst, by which I mean
when every theatre has its Ben Hur, I
shall take to cricket, like C. B. FRY,
and describe matches from the pitch in
blank verse."


"I adore ping-
pong.'
"And have you no other relaxation?"
"Ah well, an occasional burglar is
very refreshing. I get quite slim with
them. But when they corner me, I
reason wi th them: f aili ng that, I rhyme.''

"An occasional burglar is very refreshing.
I get quite lUm with them."
"And what is your new play to be
called, Mr. PHILLIPS?" I asked, as he
held the door open and lifted one of his
redundant feet in a valedictory spasm.
"Molasses: or the New Beerbolim
Treacle," he said.
WHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE.
[An F.R.C.8. writes to the Tinas to complain of
the scientific jargon adopted by lecturers at the
British Asaociation. He complains especially of
this sentence:—"In certain compound tunicate*
the atrial wall, in the egg development delimited
by a pair of ectoblastir imaginations, in the bud
development may be formed from the parental
endodermic branchial sac."]
WHENE'ER upon the atrial wall
I see a compound tunicate,
I thank my stars that after all
Mine is no ectoblastic pate.
The dolt I am I 'd rather stay
Than join the British Asses' bray.
Hee haw!
Hee haw! Hee haw! a pedant pack,
I 'd give them all the branchial sac.
AN Ostend telegram reports that the
Swedish smack Receiver has saved part
of the crew of the barque Salmo, which
was abandoned in a sinking condition.
Mr. Punch cannot help hoping that the
"smack receiver" in this case was
another GRACE DARLING, and that the
said smack was as hearty as it was
well-deserved. He of course interprets
the word in its more gallant sense.

PUNCH, OR -THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN OUT-AND-OUTING.
(A aketphy notion for a light-hearted tourist.)
AFTER a perfectly delightful trip to Bruges and Blanken-
berghe, we returned, via Ostend, in the Princesse Clementine,
The official pitied him; "Milor should have arranged his
journey otherwise. Perhaps 011 his way back—:—"
"But," persisted the noble applicant, "I am not return-
ing/' 7
The official could only shrug his shoulders sympatheti-
cally. That milor was not returning was indeed sad.
under the command of an alert and courteous captain, to. So, as a last move, to overcome the worthy doorkeeper's
whose kind forethoughtfulness it was due that the " spindle j stern sense of duty, the English milor says in his most
side" of our talented travelling company escaped the dis-; superior manner, "My good man, I am a personal friend of
heartening inconveniences of what is generally considered i King LEOPOLD. If his Majesty were here" .
rather "nasty weather." Punctuality is the courtesy of i "Ah! pardon, Milor! fa ne fait rien," the official inter-
lloyalty,and the Princesse Cle-
mentine, even with wind, tide,
and pelting rain against her,
arrived at Dover almost to the
minute expected.
There is a tremblement at
Ostend in consequence of the
banishment of all gambling
from the Kursaal after this
season. Up till now "the
play's the thing" was the
motto for the Kursaal; but
henceforth" the conscience of
the KING" will not permit
his liege subjects to encourage
the gambling proclivities of
their visitors. To what pur-
pose are "the tables" to be
turned? Well, virtue is its
own reward, and Ostend, re-
lying on natural resources,
can afford to dispense with
these superfluous attractions.
But 'twas honest gambling,
and these tables are not sup-
ported by "legs." Nay, so
mighty particular are the
authorities that rule the Cercle
within the Kursaal that the
biggest "pot," as I am in-
formed, can no more be
granted the entree without a
guarantee from his banker,
coupled with a personal intro-
duction from some member
of the Cercle, than can any
premier venu, not being a
member of (say for example)
the Athenaeum Club, walk
into its hall, hang up his straw
hat on a vacant peg, and
summon the eminently re-
spectable butler to receive his order for a nice little recherche
bachelor dinner.
Due formalities, occupying quite three days, having been
satisfactorily complied with, the aspirant for "honours
easy" may then be admitted to all the privileges of the
"inner circle," including those of losing more than he can
afford, and paying such amount in cash down on the nail.
So strict are the controlling authorities and their repre-
sentatives, acting as doorkeepers, that, on one occasion,
when a distinguished English nobleman; who happened
to be staying "for one -night only" at Ostend, presented
his card at the entrance of the Club and requested admis-
sion, the janitor in uniform replied that "the usual
formalities were essential, and could in no case be dispensed
with.
"But," explained the aristocrat, "I am here for only one
night."

"N'etant pas membre du
Cercle, a vous comme a tout
le monde I'entree est interdite,
bien que vous etiez I'ami du
Roi de carreau lui-meme!"
Whereupon he drew Milor's
attention to the reglement,
thus worded: "Pour etre
reyu parmi les membres, il
sujfit d'adresser deux jours a
I'avance au secretaire," etc.,
etc., and milor had to retire,
disappointed perhaps, but
lost in generous admiration
of the custodian who was like
poor Tom Bowling in the
ballad, inasmuch as "faith-
ful below he did his duty."
It is to be wished that
Belgium would come into line
with all other nations in the
matter of time. Of Belgium
it may truly be said that
'' her hours are numbered''—
differently, that is, to those in
France, England, Germany,
and Italy. Forgetting this
Belgian peculiarity in reckon-
ing, our plan was to leave
Ostend early, Bsy,"10h. 10m,"
arrive at Bruges in about
twenty-five minutes, spend the
day among the interesting art
collections (including 1'Er.po-
sition des Primitifs Ma-
mands), with an interval for
lunch at the Hotel du Com-
merce (good and reasonable),
and to return about four
o'clock. But on the card of
trains there is no such hour,
in the afternoon, as four o'clock! Four in the morning
is sufficient for them: they won't allow four o'clock to

Appear
in the afternoon. But instead there is, on the
train-list, 13'55 o'clock, 14'32 o'clock, 16'24 o'clock and so
on up to 22'45 o'clock. In
would be " seventeen o'clock tea!!
um "five o'clock tea"
As a heroine in one oi
IBSEN'S plays is always exclaiming, "Fancy that!"
However, one gets accustomed to everything, and so our
plan was settled to return by the 16'24 o'clock train; which
we did, after passing a delightful day among the old armour,
the ancient relics, the various curios, and the "Primitifs
Flamands" here collected. Of these many were very old
friends, only in new places.
So back to Ostend to dine, to "face the music," always
first class in choice and execution, in the Kursaal, and the
next day to visit Blankenberghe, going there by one of the
early town trains (" ehemins de fer vicinaux "), then, after

there being no horses, cabs, carriages,
or motors, between the houses and the
doge), returning by the 16'45 train,

side resort called "Le Coq."
Such, in brief, was the four days'
pleasant holiday, which, if lightly trip-

can confidently recommend.

THE power of the motor-car as a
death-dealing instrument is at last to
be officially recognised. A permanent
corps of Automobile Volunteers is to be
formed.
It is announced that shooting is to
be taught at Sandhurst. Firing in the
actual building will be still discour-
aged.
A grant is to be made to loyalists in
South Africa who have suffered loss
through the War. In certain quarters
it is felt this is a mistake, as it is calcu-
lated to irritate those colonists who
rebelled.
Mr. REITZ has made a new Peace pro-
posal. "If they give us back our
country, I will be friendly with Eng-
land," he has declared. The Govern-
ment is said to be considering the
offer. If it be not accepted, Mr. REITZ
intends to expose us in every town in
Europe, and to destroy the good
opinion of England that is always
prevalent on the Continent.
In view of his indiscreet after-dinner
speeches, M. CAMILLE PELLETAN has been
reminded that a Naval Minister had
better stick to water. It is rumoured
that he will publish an account of his
African trip under the title of The
Camitte's Hump: or, The Pelletan in
tJie Wilderness.

Wake up, England! One of our
newspapers, which prides itself on being

of the costumes and scenery. These last
will, however, be kept in reserve for
an emergency.
Another attempt to swim the Channel
has failed. The steamship companies
do not try to conceal their satisfaction
at the failure of all endeavours to find
a cheaper way to France.
When charged with stealing cheap
cigarettes at Yarmouth, a boy admitted
that he had smoked the stolen articles
at the rate of fifty a day. The magis-
trate considered he had been sufficiently
punished.
Nine additional Destroyers have
been ordered for our Navy. There are
some who consider this is not sufficient, \
but, as a matter of fact (as a French
expert points out), this is really equiva-
lent to eighteen, as each may be ex-
pected to break in two.
REUTER'S correspondent at the German
manoeuvres has stated that at the end
of a cavalry charge of thirty-two miles
"not a single horse was blown out."
Naturally. They were not at all tyred.

HYMEN played a lively tune.
But how brief is love's young day!
Bound together in the May,
They were parted by the JEONE.

WE have been favoured with the
following examination paper, which is
obligatory for all street " musicians " :—
1. Explain the different kinds of time,
specifying, without any prevarication,
how much you have " done " at various
periods of your career; and show what
course you follow (i) when a policeman
is off his beat; (ii) when he is using
his baton too freely.
2. Do you know the meaning of the

and if so, why do you invariably dis-
regard them?
3. Have you ever heard of JOHN LEECH?
What was his special aversion, and why
was he justified in the same?
4. Quote the rest of the poem begin-
ning:—
"Grinder who srenely grind^st

Till thou ultimately findest
Pence in thine unwashen palm!"
Calculate the average value (to the
nearest hour) of "ultimately."
5. What is the difference (if any)
between yourself and your monkey, as
a judge of music? If you are a German
band, omit this question, as it might
be insulting to the monkey.
6. State your preferences in the
matter of "pitch," comparing respec-
tively those (i.) at a public-house corner,
(ii.) outside a boarding-house full of
benevolent and elderly ladies, and (Hi.)
close to a literary man's front door.
Indicate at which of these you may
expect 'arf-a-pint, coin of the realm, or
a pitched battle.
7. Give any autobiographical details
that may witli safety be published (in
view of the police and extradition laws).
Mention the cause of your uninvited
appearance in the metropolis, whether,
for instance, it be due to laziness, ex-
pulsion from a music-loving country, or
a desire to escape conscription.
8. Can you give any satisfactory
reason for your continued existence?
N.B. It is not expected that an}' can-
didates will pass this paper. (To do thin,
it will be necessary to get above full
marks.) All who fail will be requested
to devote themselves at once to the
occupation of asphalt-laying, or else to
return to their native country as rogues
and vagabonds. Any individual de-
tected with more than a hundred per
cent, of the marks will be prosecuted
for endeavouring to obtain money,

pretences.

GEORGE. . .
EXTRACT FROM THE TRAVEL DIARY OF
TOBY, M.P.
Winder-mere, Monday.—GEORGE is the
crew of our sloop. When I say our
sloop, of course I mean the sloop is the
skipper's. A many-sided man the
skipper. Runs a cotton mill, a manu-
factory in Lancastria, a colliery some-
where else, and eke a copper mine in
Wales. Incidentally, he plays the oboe.
These merely episodes in a day's
work. The skipper really is a born
mechanician, a sort of English EDISON.
Has invented delicate instrument which,
fixed up in a Town Hall, controls the
hour of every clock in the borough.
Makes each show a different time. The
MEMBER FOR SARK, who has gone into
the matter, says I have no idea how
much this apparently simple device
adds to the interest of local life. An
even more important invention of the
skipper's enables him to steer a ship
from land. Whether it is not more con-
venient to follow the ordinary procedure
and steer it from the ship itself is a
matter of opinion. Quite uncanny to
see the skipper comfortably seated in
his billiard room, apparently reading
the newspaper, actually steering a
launch steaming between Lowater and
Lakeside.
After all, the skipper happiest when
steering his own sloop. She is a gem:
sister ship (little sister, of course) to
Shamrock II. Being a man of affairs,
accustomed to look ahead, the skipper
never comes aboard without lugging a
pair of sea-boots, an oil-skin of bright
yellow, and a sou'-wester.
"You never know what may happen,"
he says, casting a shrewd weather-eye
across the fleckless surface of the Lake
and round the everlasting hills, on
which the glory of September sunlight
falls.
What really did happen during the
first three days of our cruising was a
little monotonous. The faintest breath
of wind on the broad sails of the Anita
sends the sloop through the water, with
a pleasant gurgling sound at the bows.
On our first cruise we were bound for
Ferry Inn. which, in Lake society, plays
the part of the Terrace of the House of
Commons for London folk. To take
tea on the lawn at Ferry Inn, built on
a tiny promontory commanding full
view of Windermere, is its custom
of an afternoon. After two hours
spent in whistling for a wind we
were still some three miles distant from
the Ferry. -At this rate tea was hope-
less. But there was promise of arriving
in time for breakfast. Here's where
the foresight of the skipper, indicated
by sea-boots and sou'-wester, triumphed.
In his fleet is included a spacious steam

launch. Captain sent out with sealed
orders, which brought him alongside at
critical moment, took us in tow, and,
as Lloyd's report testifies, the Anita
was signalled off the Ferry in time for
5 o 'clock tea.
Returning to head of Lake circum-
stances slightly varied. This time the
Anita, after drifting a mile on the way
homeward, lay a painted ship upon a
painted ocean. After brief waiting we
were transhipped into the launch, and
so home to dinner.
Worst of all happened next day.
Being Sunday, steam launch not out.
In the evening, enticing breeze ruffling
bosom of Lake, we went [out for sail.
Anita, dancing before the unwonted
wind, went gaily off for full four miles.
Then the wind dropped, leaving us
helpless, becalmed, alone on the Lake.
Just gone half past six, and dinner at
eight. The skipper, rigid at the helm,
made the most of every puff of wind.
In an hour done a mile. The puffs
became more infrequent. Every pros-
pect of spending night on the Lake,
with no grub but the skipper's sea-
boots. Tried to make light of it. The
joke of the sort that, after long acquaint-
ance, seems to pall.
Gloom and despair settling down on
company and crew, when a boat shot
out from the land. Proved to be the

good Samaritan, who had observed our
plight. Having in these latter days
built his soul a lordly mansion house
on Windermere, possessed himself of a
boat and added to his establishment a
son (a bright, shapely, Eton boy), he
put oft to our rescue. Boarded his boat
and rowed ourselves home, leaving
GEORGE to make his way back to the
sloop's moorings at Bowness if and
when the wind willed.
One other day, our last on the Lake,
all the world was changed. There was
a wind coming out of the South that
made the Lake foam at the mouth, and
a day later filled the newspapers with
stories of wreck strewing the coast,
from Cape Clear to Dover. Before it
the sloop, eager for the strife, beat all
the way down to Lakeside, coming
back before the wind in a fashion that
laughed at steam launches.
Not much yet about GEORGE. He '11

CEDANT ARMA TOG.E!
[It ii understood th»t Dr. LEYDS has taken up
an irreconcilable attitude with regard to the
surrender of the Boer Generali, and looks upon the
peace merely as in the nature of an armistice.]
LET others leave the tented field,
Lay down the sword and tamely yield;
Let recreant burghers bow the knee
And own an alien sovereignty,
LEYDS shall be to his ancient foes
Unconquerably bellicose!
His is the heart that nought can tame,
His are the deeds that all acclaim;
BOTHA, DE WET, and DE LA EEY
And General CRONJE, who are they?
Their deeds are dim, their glory fades
Beside the loud repute of LEYDS.
The Hague has seen his prowess shown
And Europe heard his trumpet blown;
His knightly figure, all confess,
Did great achievements in the Press,
And—from his Netherland retreat—
This great man never owned defeat!
Choosing a comfortable spot
Where bayonet and shell were not,
He plied a very valiant pen,
Bidding the fighters come again.
And no one ever heard liim whine
When bullets thinned the fighting line.
While others bore the battle's brunt
He showed a calm unruffled front.
The wounded Dopper on the veld
His steadfast spirit could not melt;
Still from the land where he had gone
He stoutly cried, "Fight on! Fight
on!"

Though beaten, still renewed the fray,
He urged them on into the breach,
Himself securely out of reach,

And amply guarded by police,
Where never bullet whistles near
To shake a brave man's heart with fear,
He nails his colours to the mast,
And breathes defiance to the last!

THE CURSE OF FICTION.
Is WRITING FOR MONEY A NATIONAL EVIL?
THERE are no signs of diminution in
the controversy aroused by the famous
International footballer, Mr. G. 0.
SMITH, who, in a recent letter to the
Daily Mailyfist, denounces the writing
of novels for money as a national evil.
A few of the communications on both
sides of the question are given below:—
WASTED SATURDAY AFTERNOONS.
It is not so much that novelists are
paid for their deleterious work as that
thousands of English men and women,
boys and girls, spend their Saturday
afternoons in reading these poisonous
productions instead of recruiting their
health in the open air. That is the real
objection. Only the other day I came
across a strong lad poring over Captains
Courageous when he might have been
playing Association with the other boys
of his age and learning to be a man.
GOAL POST.
No GREAT MEN WRITE NOVELS.
I am delighted to see you have fear-
lessly tackled this great evil. Agility
and mobility are the prime factors in
national efficiency, and the writing and
reading of novels involves a sedentary
existence, conduces to dyspepsia, and
impairs the eyesight. I can state on
the best of authority that neither Lord
KITCHENER, Lord CHARLES BERESFORD, nor
President ROOSEVELT has ever written
a novel. ARNOLD WHITE.
THE TESTIMONY OF A CHAMPION.
As a boy I was very partial to
novelettes, but my game improved 50
per cent, after I gave them up. I now
read nothing but the Dictionary of
National Biography, which helps me to
keep on the Lee side of staleness.
PETER LATHAM,
Amateur Racquet & Tennis Champion.
FOOTBALL A RECUPERATOR.
Mr. G. 0. SMITH'S letter seems to me
an unwarrantable attack on a very
worthy and respectable body of men.
The labourer surely is worthy of his
hire; the novelist no less than the
football professional. And this reminds
me that I owe footballing a great debt,
for when in the midst of writing my
romance, The Impregnable City, I had
a nervous breakdown. I was cured
only by spending a much-needed holi-
day in watching a football match.
MAX PEMBERTON.
NOVEIS LEAD TO LYING.
I have no doubt that there are
literary men whose lives are blameless
and whose tendencies are not homicidal,
but there is no doubt but that the
capacity to tell stories leads to lying
in all its branches, particularly when.

MB. PUNCH'S SUGGESTION FOE THE AUTHORITIES TO STEP IN AND UTILISE THB LATENT ERUDITION OF THE FORCE.
THE MISADVENTURES OF THE HON. HERCULES BROWNE, C.M.C.
THE East plays many tricks with the men whose days are
passed in its thin, transparent atmosphere and its blinding
sun-glare, but it tampers with nothing so vitally as with
their sense of proportion. This, of course, has nothing at
all to do with the climate—a scape-goat which is made to
carry not only the burden of its own sins, but those which
belong to the whisky-bottle—since it arises solely from the
circumstances in which the exiled European is placed. To
be a big man in a small community is very bad for the
character; to be a big official in the East is simply destruc-
tion. It is well enough so long as the big official remains
on his own proper dung-hill, where he may crow un-
opposed by rival roosters, but sooner or later the age-
limit of his service is reached, and the superannuated
civil servant is forced to retire to the wilds of West
Kensington, or to some similar corner of the land which,
though he calls it "Home," and boasts that he has served
it loyally, has never so much as heard his name or that
of the cranny of the Empire in which he has been for
so long a shining light of surpassing brilliancy. The
sudden change from eternal sunshine to haze and fog of an
almost equal permanency is only typical of that other greater
change in the estate of the man who is its victim. From
being the Hon. SO-AND-SO SNOOKS, Member of the Council,
Head of Such-and-such a Department, and Heaven knows
what besides, he becomes suddenly plain Mr. SNOOKS, an
obscure and not too wealthy individual, an object of interest
to nobody, robbed in a moment of those salutations in the
market-place which he has learned to regard as his just
tribute. When he opens his mouth for the purpose of
enunciating some of those dogmatic opinions for which he is
famous, he is shocked to find that his slow words are not
listened to with the respect, the bated breath, to which his
former experiences have accustomed him. Quite "junior"
men argue with him fearlessly; others either ignore his
views or contradict him flatly to his face. The whole
scheme of things seems to have gone awry, and he suffers
from a sense of unmerited injury, outrage and ingratitude.
In fact he has fallen from the Seats of the Mighty, and the
jar is a very nasty one, which sometimes sends him soured
and discontented to a premature grave.
I have viewed these tragi-comedies with a great deal of
sympathy and compassion, for I have been privileged to
witness the greatness of the great little men of the P^ast in
the heyday of their majesty, and I know what the fall must
mean to them. The completeness of that fall has never
surprised me, but none the less I must own to having
experienced something very like astonishment when I found
the man whom I had last known as the Hon. HERCULES
BROWNE, C.M.G.—one of the most lordly of our "little tin
gods" — seated, hatless, torn, dishevelled, battered, and
swearing furiously in Tamil, on the pavement of Pall Mall
at half-past ten o'clock on a rainy winter's night. Four
footmen in the livery of the Omnigatherum stood grinning
on the steps of that well-known Club, and as I watched a
fifth joined them, and threw a coat, hat and umbrella at the
Hon. HERCULES, hitting him with each missile in a most
dexterous fashion.
I loyally retrieved the Hon. HERCULES and his scattered
property, put him and them into a cab, and drove off
hurriedly amid the cheering of a crowd of street loafers.
The temper of the Hon. HERCULES was as ruffled as his
person, and I felt that it was more than my life was worth
to question him as to his recent adventures but I took him

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
to his house, somewhere on the other side of Earl's Court
railway station, and handed him over to his wife. While
doing so I was able to disabuse my mind of its first dis-
graceful impression, for it was plain to me that, whatever
else he might be, the great man was perfectly sober. My
curiosity, however, was piqued, and I later set on foot an
enquiry as to the events of the night, with the result that I
succeeded in eliciting the following distressing facts.
The Hon. HERCULES, who a few weeks earlier had retired
from the service of the Asiatic colony in which it had been
my privilege to enjoy his condescending acquaintance, had
been invited to dine at the Omnigatherum by a friend. On
arrival at the Club he had been informed that his friend
had not yet put in an appearance, and he was shown into a
waiting-room, in which he fumed and ramped for a matter
of half-an-hour. A feeling of incomprehensible neglect had
been present in his mind pretty constantly ever since his
landing in England, and the fact that his friend had now
kept him waiting for his dinner without excuse or explana-
tion added to his sense of injury. At last his dignity could
bear the insult put upon it no longer. He had been invited
to dine at the Omnigatherum, and at the Omnigatherum he
would dine. He rose from the arm-chair into which he had
thrown himself, and with that magnificence of deportment
which had always characterised his movements, stalked up
the big staircase, and seated himself at a table in the
dining-room. The waiters looked at him curiously, but he
had passed the hall-porter, and his presence was no affair of
theirs. His air of self-confideuce and assurance did the
rest. He ate his dinner in state, paid for it under his own
name without protest, and then betook himself to the
smoking-room for the enjoyment of his coffee and a cigar.
In all this he had no sense of irregularity, of being guilty
of an impropriety. On the contrary, he was too thoroughly
imbued with the idea of his own importance, his own claims
to consideration, too convinced that whatever the Hon.
HERCULES saw fit to do must for that very reason be right,
that he never so much as thought of questioning the fitness
of that which he was doing. If anyone had whispered to him
the suspicion that the members of the Omnigatherum would
not be pleased if they learned the use which he was making
of their sacred and exclusive mansion, he would hare treated
the notion with scorn. For more years than he cared to
count he had walked unquestioned into all the resorts to
•which his fellows had access, warmed by the pleasing con-
sciousness that he was thereby conferring rather than
receiving a favour. For him English life was a thing
hopelessly out of focus. The imposing figure of the Hon.
HERCULES BROWNE, C.M.G., had for long bulked so big on
his mental horizon that he could not of a sudden accom-
modate himself to a world in which plain HERCULES BROWNE,
no more to be dignified with the title of " Honourable," was
an unconsidered atom, and in which the letters after his
name signified nothing more exalted than "Colonial-Made
Gentleman."
Wearied at length of solitude and inaction, the Hon.
HERCULES reared himself out of his arm-chair, and began to
roam at large through the Club. He did not wish to return
home yet awhile, for he shrunk from revealing to his wife
the painful fact that he had suffered from the intolerable
insult conveyed by his friend's failure to keep his appoint-
ment. In the near past men had tumbled over one another
to do him reverence, to run at his bidding, to come at his
beck, and had vied with one another for the honour of
entertaining him as their guest. Never until this evening
had the horror of his fall been written so plainly for him;
but he would conceal the fact from the wife in whose eyes
he was still to be counted among the great ones of the earth.
Meditating these things in a sullen and discontented spirit,
the Hon. HERCULES wandered through the great, warm,

Bertie. "MUMMY DEAR, I'M GOING TO TAKB MINK OFF, AND
MTfUCTCH 'EM IN THIS, LIKE PAFA DOES, TO KEEP 'EM FROM BAOOWO
AT TEX KSEES I"
brilliantly-lighted and thickly-carpeted corridors until chance
led him into the card-room of the Club. Here he seated
himself in a vacant cliair near one of the tables, and watched
four men playing a game of bridge. He was himself a keen
lover of the game, and he presently became engrossed in
observing the play and the fortunes of the strangers near
him. His chair placed him on a level somewhat below that
of the men at the table, and this accident enabled him to
detect the fact that the player nearest to him was dealing in
a very peculiar manner. The cards which he gave to his
opponents were slipped from the top of the pack in the
ordinary way, but those to himself and his partner came
now and again not from the top but from the bottom of the
deck. The Hon. HERCULES could hardly believe his eyes.
He stared in blank astonishment. He could just see the
bottom card of the pack by sinking a little lower into the
cushions of his chair. It was the ace of hearts. A moment
later the dealer had given a card to his parser, and behold
the ace of hearts had vanished!
That waa at once enough and too much for the Hon.
HERCULES. He rose up, portentous, dignified, awfiil, with
that " Day of Judgment" look upon his face which had so
often brought terror to the hearts of recalcitrant juniors.
His duty was plain. A man of his standing and position,
he felt, was bound to put a stop to such ill-doing as this
when enacted under his very nose.
"Gentlemen," he said, "I very much regret the necessity
which compels me to take this action, but this gentleman"
(indicating the delinquent with a splendid gesture) "ia not
dealing fairly. I have been observing him for some
moments, and I have detected him in the act of cheating."
The players laid aside their cards, and four faces, all
flushed, angry and indignant, were suddenly turned in the
direction of the Hon. HERCULES.

[According to the Daily Mail Mr. HABRY Di: WINDT can tee no engineering difficulty in the way of the Behring Straits Railway.]
"Who are you, Sir, may I ask?" said the three men who
had not been accused, in hostile chorus.
"I am Mr. HERCULES BROWNE," was the answer, spoken
with all the dignity which the utterance of that great name
demanded.
"Are you a member of this Club?" asked the chorus.
-",1 have not that honour," said BROWNE, with portentous
solemnity. <l;I came here to dine with a gentleman of my
acquaintance—Mr. FISCHER."
One of the men called a waiter and whispered some-
thing to him. He departed hurriedly, and an awkward
silence followed, during which BROWNE stood uneasily in the
centre of the hostile group, which scowlingly ignored his
presence.
"Here is my card," he said at length, fumbling in his
waistcoat pocket, and tendering the pasteboard to the
gravest looking of the four strangers. The man refused the
proffered gift, and turned his back on the Hon. HERCULES
with the utmost insolence.
BROWNE'S breath was completely taken away by this fresh
outrage, and1 bMore he could find words in which to frame
a suitable protest the waiter reappeared, followed by the
hall-porter who had admitted the Hon. HERCULES earlier in
the evening, and a crowd of furtively grinning footmen.
"Has Mr. FISCHER been in the Club this evening ?" asked
the man who had declined BROWNE'S card.
"No, Sir," said the hall-porter.
"Has he ever brought this gentleman into the Club
before?"
"No, Sir. Never seen the gentleman in my life, Sir."
"Now then, Sir," said the youngest of the card-players.
"Will you kindly explain yourself?"
The man whom BROWNE had accused of cheating
beamed upon him with vile triumph. The Hon. HERCULES
felt as though this were an evil dream. His indignation
and horror fairly choked liim; he could only stammer out,
"I am Mr. HERCULES BROWNE ... I 'm a Companion of the
Most Distinguished Order ..."
"Be damned to you," interrupted the youngest young
gentleman, airily. "We are going to invest you with the
Most Distinguished Order of the Boot. Here, you fellows,
out with him!" And at the word, and at a sign from the
man who had acted as spokesman to the party, the waiters
rushed at the Hon. HERCULES, seized him violently in spite
of his outcry and his struggles, shot him down the stairs in
a series of ungainly and wholly involuntary bounds, wiped
the hall with him, and finally dumped him down upon the
dripping pavement without the building. .
But the thing which hurts the Hon. HERCULES more than
all this is the fact that his friend FISCHER, who has had
some trouble with the Club committee, far from offering an
apology or expressing regret for the affronts to which his
guest was exposed, has written to say that he, BROWNE, had
only himself to blame, and that he, FISCHER, has no further
use for his, BROWNE'S, acquaintance.
This surely, thinks the Hon. HERCULES, is adding insult
to injury. H. C.

POOR old Canada! It seems as if
Providence had fated her always to
struggle under the overpowering weight
of a vast misconception in the eyes of
the great British public. For years,
from an English point of view, she has
been the land of snow and ice, of awe-
inspiring infinite cold, the great lone
land of the Red Indian, the grizzly
bear and the midnight sun. The
Dominion Government, half hopeless,
yet never despairing, has struggled
heroically to dissipate the vapour of
ignorance, to let the light of truth
snine in on the millions of darkened
minds. At last it has succeeded, but
with deplorable results, due to the
blinding effect of an excess of light.
I have just come off the top of a
Liverpool Street to Pimlico 'bus. The
driver glared at a newspaper contents-
bill which told of a train running off a
bridge into a river and drowning fifty
people. He turned to me.
"That 'd maik a fair bit uv a

had seen a whole train run into a river,
as a result of heavy rains having

The Canadian Arch has more than
done its work. Ten years hence we
may expect to see the following type
of article in the London newspapers
inspired by the Office of the High
Commissioner for Canada.
"Prof. X. PLOUER and his party of
scientists have just returned from the

report that at no time during the year

possible to work at all hours of the
day, without experiencing nervous pros-
tration. They found the climate to be
delightfully cool and bracing, and deny
absolutely that locusts and dust-storms
are among the country's objectionable
features. The expedition has once and
for all proved the utter falsehood of the
stories which have so long gained
credence—stories to the effect that the
shores of Coronation Gulf and the
Arctic Ocean are so overgrown with
various species of cactus and prickly
pear as to make travelling extremely
difficult. We hope that in view of
these etc., etc.'

OF politics, persons or sport
I could always make verse of a sort,
Or write an ephemeral lay
On the weather, the crops, or the day;
But now—when I tackle a lyric
I 'm forced to conclude and deplore
That my talent was merely empiric;
I cannot make rhymes any more.
I was wont, I remember, to sing
To my Lady like, say, anything,
And shoved every word I could shove
Into ballads that babbled of love.
But now—though my passion 's as hearty
I 've lost all my previous lore;
A sad and prosaic old party,
I cannot make rhymes any more.
Perhaps in the fulness of time
I shall learn how to scan and to rhyme,
Find out how my poems were made,
And remember the tricks of the trade.
But now—I am nought but a talker,
A deadly inveterate bore—
Since someone abstracted my Walker
I cannot make rhymes any more!

[OCTOBER 1, 1902.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN THE PURLIEUS OF THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNE.
NOTHING impresses the casual visitor to Monte Carlo so
much as the studied decorum of the place, and the deli-
berate restraint put upon their emotions by the plungers of
the Casino. I understand that Mr. JONES, the author of
Chance, the. Idol, has made a scholarly research, in situ,
into the manners and customs of the Principality of Monaco.
This must account for his having discovered many things
which commonly escape the careless eye of the bird of
passage. The figure of his Fortune-teller for instance—a
sort of oracular Cassandra, of Endor extraction, painted,
dishevelled, mercenary, who from the steps of a popular
restaurant recommends to her votaries a course of red or
black (symbolised by her cheeks and her hair)—is not one
that has occurred too obtrusively in my more limited
experiences of Monte Carlo. Certainly, if the type became
at all usual, it would sensibly increase the labours of those
excellent agents whose task it is to assist the inconvenient
across the border.
Again, the experience of the amateur goes to show that
the most advanced kind of gambler, as he strolls unaffectedly
to the tables after dinner, allows himself no further licence
than to say, tentatively, to his companion: "I am in mourn-
ing for an aunt-in-law; I think I shall go on the black;''
or "I have observed a stuffed flamingo in a shop-window;
I propose to flutter on the red." But Mr. JONES has seen
ladies on the eve of a plunge standing in gorgeous salons,
crushing bank-notes in their uplifted right hands and
crying "Rouge gagne! Rouge gagne!" in the confident
voice of a fanatical Crusader waving -his bloody sword on
the outer ramparts of Jerusalem. He has seen gaudy
youths come bounding at this juncture into the apartments
of these inspired ladies, merrily shouting "No, no! On
the contrary, Rouge perd! Rouge perd!" and returning on
an almost instantaneous shutter, having only escaped imme-
diate death because the revolver has failed to trace the site
of their elusive modicum of brain.
I do not wish to cavil. After all, the pit and the' family
circle (those bulwarks of the drama) cannot be supposed to
know their Monte Carlo; and in any case it is the business
of the playwright, as his art is understood, to improve on
the facts. But I cannot help feeling, though this is Mr.
JONES'S own affair, that if such was the picture which he
had determined to present, he has wasted a great deal of
his precious time (if nothing of still greater value) over local
explorations.
For the rest, where the author comes in touch with human
nature, I find his main theme only too pitifully possible.
That the behaviour of Ellen Farndon, in following up her
retired lover and trying to win him to marriage by making
enough money at the tables to pay his debts and start him
in a domestic career, should have in it more of shamelessness
than her original lapse from virtue, need astonish nobody
who has grasped the extravagant lengths to which a woman
may be carried through mere lack of imagination. That
she should delay the consummation of her prime purpose
by wasting her winnings on confections de luxe (as the
Times critic would call them) with the idea of recapturing
his affections is equally conceivable. But Mr. JONES, who
is on sure ground here, seems still to have committed an
error in subscribing to the noxious fashion of writing his
chief part round a particular personality. It is said to fit
Miss LENA ASHWELL like a glove. The simile is very exactly
apposite. The part does fit her like a glove; and like a
well-fitting glove, produces the effect of a lifeless simulacrum
of the living hand. If one might dare so far to depart from
the conventions of modern dramatic criticism as to pass reflec-
tions on the performance of an actor, as distinct from the
work of a playwright, I should venture to hint that that
exceptionally intelligent performer, Miss ASUWELL, is over-
whelmed.'by a sense of what is expected of her by those who
associate her talent with a specific type. She pitches the
note of impending tragedy too high at too early a stage.
Her tone over commonplaces of speech is fraught with a
pathos that rives the marrow. She receives the idea, let us
say, of luncheon at a restaurant, less cheerfully than a man
might view the prospect of breakfast immediately prior to
his execution. Her state of morbid intensity becomes an
obsession. The gamut is exhausted half way through the
rising scale, and the iterated hammering proceeds on the
top note till it is worn out and the lid is suffered to
descend.
Into the rather lurid atmosphere of our melodrama
the delightfully ingenuous performance of Miss WINIFRED
ARTHUR-JONES brings a very gracious relief. Her looks and
her speeches are alike charming—which may explain how
it was that the watch-dogs of the Casino allowed so young
and guileless a speculator to pass its portals—and in the
pleasant irony that surrounds this character the father-
author shows at his best. Miss KATE SERGEANTSON (who, to
be frank, has a not very stimulating presence) made a quite
decent attempt to interpret the part of the worldly Lady
Mary, who has the inconspicuous soul of ALAN LEVERSAGE
in her social keeping. He will make Ellen Farndon an
"honest woman" if she (Lady Mary) says he is to. Lady
Mary objects on principle to gambling, but if the result
should be a clear £10,000, she would not enquire too
curiously into its source. Yet with all this brutal cynicism
which protests against the acceptance of the girl's sacrifices
unless the margin left over from them reaches an irreducible
minimum, she is not without a touch of plain womanly
sympathy, for -Ellen's 'embarrassment. It is a character
not too stereotyped, but recognisably true in its inconsis-
tencies.
I cannot honestly join with the critics in denouncing the
runagate lover (played with a right absence of colour by Mr.
GRAHAM BROWNE) as too fatuously contemptible. Is this, we
are asked, is this poor-blooded creature the kind of man
whom so strenuous a woman as Ellen Farndon would risk
her eternal weal and a good sprinkling of golden louis to
retrieve? Personally, I think he is precisely the type of
person on whom such a woman would so waste herself.
Let any man, though he were as modest as the present
writer, consider the relative neglect almost habitually shown
to superior men, and he will, with me, support the judg-
ment of Mr. JONES.
Mr. TITHERADGE, in the minor part of .the girl's father,
was admirably within the picture: and it only remains,
since I missed Mr. STERNROYD'S appearance in the first act,
to speak of the performance of Mr. ESMOND in the now
indispensable role of friend of all families concerned. Out
of compliment to the proprietor of the Theatre in which he
was playing, Mr. ESMOND endeavoured with spasmodic
success to reproduce the pleasantly gruff intonation of Mr.
WYNDHAM. But though he played most capably, it would
have needed the inimitable skill of Mr. WYNDHAM'S self to
throw off all those excellent admonitions without permitting
their platitudinous character to be suspected. Mr. ESMOND
also failed to maintain the reserve that is necessary to this
kind of part. He had the initial advantage, as I was
sincerely pleased to notice, of representing a gentleman who
was supposed to be suffering from an incurable malady of
the lower limbs, which precluded his hopping about the
stage in the manner that Mr. ESMOND usually affects. But
even so he could not conceal his possession of that qnality
that is so fatally over-rated in the profession; I refer to his
faculty for "keeping things going." And, indeed, his
physical infirmity only seemed to leave his mind more
terribly alert. 0. S.

the American base-ball pitcher and by the adoption
nf a special course of gymnastic training. "Aim
watching, followed by quick marts, full and fast

NOT long ago, in virile verse,
Our RCDYAHD, eloquently railing,
Marked our decline from laad to worse,
And laid las finger on each failing.
How could, he asked, the island race
Expect to dominate the Channel
So long as pride of foremost place
Was given to our fools in flannel?
The fires of controversy blazed
And PEMBERTON, renouncing fiction,
Against the football-fetish raised
His voice in strident malediction.
Must we then, at our KIPLING'S call,
Discrown the sovereignty of cricket?
Boycott, with MAX, the blameless bill,
And make it criminal to kick it?
"No, no," we hear great MILES exclaim,
A champion athlete, tough and lusty,
"It 's not the game that is to blame;
It is the method that is musty.
"In cricket, just as in Combines,
F as eat ab hostibun doceri,
And played on Transatlantic lines
The game no longer need be dreary.
"Only let baseball players be
Our guides in catching, throwing,
smiting,
And very shortly you will see
KIPLING a palinode inditing.
"I also purpose to impart,
Among a host of new inventions,
Command of poise, of sudden start,
Followed by ' full and fast extensions.'
"Nor will these virtues be confined
Merely within the sphere of muscle;
They obviously react on mind,
teach a nation how to ' hustle.'

Her faded laurels proudly blossom,
In cricket floor the kangaroo,
In commerce rout the slim opossum.

"OH I sye, come an" 'ave a look at
this! Lover-ly meat! Nar then, 'oo 's
goin' t' 'ave a pahnd o' this for eight-
pence? Buy-buy-buy-buy-buy!"
The butcher is a young and vigorous
man, prematurely bald. Standing out-
side the shop he holds, lovingly poised
in the palm of his hand, a slab of meat,
a sample of the serried pink and white
rows illumined in glowing colours liy
the waving oil-lamps behind him. He
directs his invitations chiefly to the
matrons who, accompanied by small
girls with net-work baskets, pass criti-
cally from shop to shop, intent on con-
verting into solid foods for to-morrow
the earnings that their husbands had
fondly hoped to liquefy to-.niglit.
"'Ere—hi—missus, come an' 'ave a
look at this 'ere lor a bit of mutton!
There's a Sunday dinner fer the ole
man! Buy-buy-buy-buy-buy!"
The butcher pauses to mop the top
of his head, which is shining with his
rhetorical exertions. A passing navvy
lurches towards the shop. The butcher
stretches out a hand just in time to
prevent him falling into a headless
corpse that swings ignominiously by its
hind legs in the doorway.
"Nar then, my lad," he cries good-
humouredly; "steady-wo-ho!''
The navvy, on recovering his balance,
draws himself up with dignity.
"'Oo are yer torkin' to?" he de-
mands.
"Steady 's the word," observes the
butcher cheerily.
The navvy surveys him with severe
displeasure.
"'Oo are yer callin' yer lad?" he
demands. "I 'm not yer lad."
"All right, ole man," returns the
butcher, "don't go gettin' of yer shirt
aht abaht it."
The navvy looks at him steadily.
"If I choose ter get my shirt aht,"
he observes with hauteur, "I shall get
it aht."
"All right, ole man," returns the
other, " 'oo 'a preventin' of yer?"
The navvy seems to find some diffi-
culty in discovering an adequate reply
to this riposte.
"Look "ere," he says eventually,
"don't you try ter tork ter me, because
I won't 'ave it."
'' Come buy-buy-buy-buy-buy-buy !''
calls the butcher.
"Callin' me yer lad," Bays the
navvy. "I'm not yer lad."
"Oh buy-buy-buy-buy-buy," con-
tinues the butcher; "lover-ly meat."
"For two pins," declares the navvy
perseveringly, " I'd put my fist through
yer bloomin' "ead."
The butcher desists from his invita-
tions.
"You'd do wot?" he demands.
"I'd put my fist," repeats the navvy,
"through yer bloomin' 'ead—fer two
pins."
"Oh yer would, would yer?" re-
marks the butcher.
"I would," says the navvy.
There is u pause.
"Oh no yer wouldn't," observes the
butcher sophistically,—" not through
it."
"Yes I would," returns the navvy,
"right through it—fer two pins."
The butcher regards his adversary
with infinite scorn. By an obvious
effort he returns to his business. The
navvy shows no signs of departure.
"Wah! Callin' me yer lad," ho
repeats loudly.
There is no response from the butcher,
who turns his back to select new samples
of meat. The navvy proceeds to remove
his coat with a good deal of pomp and
circumstance.
"I '11 tell yer wot I 'm goin' ter do,"
he observes. "When you 've stopped
torkin' I 'm goin' ter put my fist
through yer bloomin' 'ead."
And then , suddenly there is a new
arrival on the scene in the person of a
little thick-set man with a knotted hand-

kerchief round his neck. He walks up
to the navvy.
"Wot?" he demands impressively,
"you 'd threaten to 'it a pore ole bald-
'eaded man? D'yer think I cawn't 'it
a man?"
The butcher looks up suddenly. The
navvy picks up his coat.
"Wot's 'e wanter call me 'is Lid
for?" he demands in self-justification.
"I'm not 'is lad."
"Why shouldn't 'e call yer 'is lad?"
returns the newcomer. "Ain't- 'e old
enough ter be yer father? You'd threaten
to 'it a pore ole bald-'eaded man?"
D'yer think 1 cawn't 'it a man?"
The navvy is with difficulty strug-
gling into his coat. The butcher is
looking his champion up and down
with dumfounded indignation.
"D'yer think I cawn't 'it a man?"
repeats the knight-errant truculently.
"I don't sye nothin'," replies the
navvy, "about wot you cen do or wot
you cawn't do."
"Ho, that's all right," returns the
knight-errant, "becos I 'm goin' ter
teach you to threaten a pore ole man
wot might be yer father. D'yer think
Z cawn t 'it a man?"
The butcher is a scarlet picture of
unrest. The navvy has become sud-
denly confidential. He makes an attempt
to draw the knight-errant aside.
"Look 'ere, ole man," he observes,
"you've got your livin' to earn, an'
I 've got my livin' to earn. Goo'
night.
He holds out his hand. The knight-
errant rejects it with loathing and
disgust.
"You was threat'nin'," he maintains,
"to 'it a pore ole bald 'eaded man."
Suddenly the butcher pushes his face
between them.
"'Oo are you a callin' pore?"
The knight-errant is staggered. The
navvy gracefully accepts the background.
"'Oo are you a callin' a pore ole
man? Wodder you wauter go inter-
ferin' for?"
The knight-errant remains speechless.
"There s some people," slates the
butcher savagely, "as is always iuter-
ferin' with wot don't concern 'em.
That's your sort."
"'E threatened to 'it yer, didn't 'o?"
challenges the astonished knight-errant.
"An wot's it got ter do with you if
'e did?" demands the butcher. "In-
terferin' 'ere an' callin' people pore."
There is a pause.
"Well an' why shouldn't I call yer
pore?" hazards the knight-errant argu-
mentatively.
"Don't yer do it, that's all," returns
the butcher. "I'll tell yer wot's the
matter with you. You want a thick
ear, that's wot you want, or yer
wouldn't go about interferin'."

There is a brief scuffle, of which the
jutcher sustains decidedly the worst
part. As a climax he is knocked back-
wards into the swinging, headless
corpse, bringing it with him to the
ground with a good deal of clatter.
A crowd has collected in a moment.
The navvy is helping the butcher to his
feet. The knight-errant is hybristically
expressing his complete readiness to
fight anyone else who wants it. A
policeman arrives, and the butcher,
who has been hitherto in a state of
coma, begins to struggle violently in
! the navvy's grasp, imploring to be
allowed to "get at "im."
"Oh, look at 'is eye!
exclaims a
"Pore ole

man! It's a shame!"
The crowd take up the cry, and the
knight-errant is driven protesting away
by the policeman, followed by a
virtuous and indignant mob.
In the doorway of the shop the navvy
is assisting the butcher to apply a piece
of his own meat to the injured eye. A
sympathetic group of matrons looking
on are expressing the opinion that what
the bullying cur wants is hard labour.
Far down the street the knight-errant,
released by the policeman, is making
hia way home, still followed, at a
respectful distance, by a hooting group
of moralists.

GEORGE.
EXTRACT FROM THE TRAVEL
DIARY OF TOBF, M.P.
Windermere, Mon-
day. — GEORGE is a
Lancashire lad. His
drawl and accent, both
incommunicable on
paper, add charm to
his narrative as he
leans over the gunwale
of the sloop, watching
for the ripple that pro-
mises wind. He has
signed on for the sea-
son, acting as crew
when the skipper sails
the sloop in the July
Regatta. Out of the
season he goes back to
his earlier vocation
as a fisherman. He
owns his own boat,
now lying up in
Morecambe Bay; oc-
casionally sails it himself.
This he did through seven weeks,
when he happed upon those shrimps.
One day, casting his net some miles out
from Morecambe Bay, he hauled aboard
a great catch of the finest shrimps.
Having loaded hh boat he made for
land and the market. Did he put in at
Morecambe Bay, where all his mates
lived? Not GEORGE. He made for a
neighbouring port, shipping his shrimps
straight for the Manchester market,
receiving sixpence for every quart.
Occasionally necessity compelled him
to look in at Morecambe, and all the
chaps were anxious, to know where he
was fishing and what luck he had.
"But they didn't get to know,"
GEORGE says, quietly.
In the ordinary way he goes a-fishing
with a mate, sometimes two. On one
voyage his companions were two brothers.
Whereby hangs a tale. On a day in a
rough sea one of the brothers was acci-
dentally knocked overboard. After the
fashion of fishermen, confessed
GEORGE, "TUMMAS couldn't swim." lie
sank like lead. Over all the turbulent
sea, far and near, there was no sign of
him. The surviving brother, abandon-
ing hope, began to bewail the loss of
TUMMAS.
"Why, there's TUMMAS! " said GEORGE,
pointing to a head appearing over the
port side of the boat, followed by a
drenched figure.
Sure enough, it was TUMMAS. Going
overboard lie snatched at a coil of
rope. It payed out in embarrassing
length, which landed TUMMAS un-
pleasantly near the bottom of the sea.
When the rope was taut it occurred to
him that he might as well go aloft.
So hand over hand he came up the rope,

emerging to be greeted by GEORGE'S
matter-of-fact incontrovertible remark,
"Why, there 's TUMMAS!"
GEORGE is not given to wasting words
in what some people might regard as
exciting moments. At anchor in his
boat in Morecambe Bay a sudden squall
came on which lashed the sea into foam.
The fishing boat dragged her anchor,
and peril of drifting ashore was immi-
nent. Voices from the pier urged
GEORGE to run his boat alongside, where
ropes would be ready for the rescue.
That meant wreck of the boat, and
GEORGE " wanted it." His mate, faced by
the imminence of sudden death, "went
silly," as GEORGE puts it.
"Run into the Promenade!" he
yelled.
GEORGE took a look round the raging
sea. Fisher boats, he tells me, never
run before the wind. They can beat up
against any gale. But his sails were
not set. So he resolved on the perilous
course of running before the wind, drag-

ging the anchor. First
of all he had his de-
mented mate to dis-
pose of.
"I couldn't," he
explained, "mind the
ship and have him
goin' on silly."
He accordingly led
the terrified man to
their common sleeping
berth, shoved him in
head first and locked
the door. Then GEORGE
took the tiller, and
running before the
wind, braved out the
storm on the open sea.
He ever had short
ways with mates in
difficulty. On another
day, out in stormy
weather, with the net
over board, his mate,
attempting to haul
it in, fell into the
sea. GEORGE threw him a rope, but it
fell short of his grasp. After the marvel-
lous fashion of fisherfolk BILL HIGH too,
with water, water everywhere, had never
learned to swim. He sank, and GEORGE
was left lonely on the stormy sea.
However, business was business.
There was the net, and it must lie
hauled in. So GEORGE set himself,
unaided, to the task. It was made the
greater by discovery of extraordinary
good luck. Not for days had he had
such a haul. GEORGE thought sadly of
the one who was gone, whose heart
would, in other circumstances, have
been cheered by prospect of his share
in the miraculous draught. Sweating
and straining, GEORGE at length suc-
ceeded in hauling up the net, and lo!
at rest witliin its folds was BILL HIGH.
He was apparently drowned and done
for. But GEORGE was not the man to let
a mate die for lack of effort. Getting the
body aboard, not waiting to extricate it
from the net, he knelt upon it and
began what he understood to be the
process of restoring the apparently
drowned.
"I kneaded him for nearly two hours
before he came round," said GEORGE.
"Next day he had to go to 'orspital,
and," he added reflectively, wondering
how in the circumstances such things
could be, "they found he 'd broke five
ribs." As for BILL HIGH, having tried
drowning and suffered GEORGE'S process
of restoration, he prefers drowning.
SOMETHING "TERRIBLE !"—What does
the exclamation " Great Scott!" mean?
Henceforth, of course, it can only be
taken as an allusion to Captain PERCY
SCOTT, C.B., followed by several " notes
of admiration."

are in occupation of Fouracre Island,
which is being circulated in some of

entirely without foundaton. In official
circles all knowledge of such a thing is
denied."—The Ttiundcrer, Saturday.

lifted from the path in which . . . .
&c., &c."—TJie Early SJiout, Saturday.
"An exciting story reaches us from
the captain of the Ciudad Pittsvilla, a
Spanish sloop trading in the South
Pacific, which throws more light on the
Fouracre incident. He put in, as usual,
at the island for the purpose of exhibit-
ing his new stock of beads on the beach,
but was at once attacked by the inhabi-
tants, who opened fire on him with
bows and arrows. He was only able to
get back to his vessel just in time, and
the anchor was hardly raised ere a
swarm of canoes approached the ship.
The captain affirms that in the stern of
each canoe was seated a man dressed in
a blue uniform. From the description
given we have little difficulty in recog-
nising the uniform of the London
constabulary. We hear that the KAISER
has telegraphed to the captain to con-
gratulate him on his fortunate escape,
reserving to himself, however, the right
of re-publication."—New Chicago Error
(Paris edition), Monday.
"The story of Fouracre Island
receives new and picturesque embroi-
deries. It is impossible to take it
seriously, but we may say that the
Foreign Office has disclaimed all know-
ledge of the island and everything
connected with it. If there is anything
in the rumour at all, the only possible
explanation is that King TOOROOIXK) may
have engaged some London policemen,
independently, as a private bodyguard.
Nothing is known, however, at Scotland
Yard."— The Thunderer, Tuesday.
"The Fouracre dispute has assumed
a more serious aspect than was at first
anticipated. While no one can regret
more than ourselves the employment of
force, the pluck shown by the handful
of Englishmen on the island wholly
discredits those who maintain that
Great Britain is on the down grade.

"There can no longer be any doubt
as to the annexation of Fouracre Island
by Great Britain. If by nothing else it
is sufficiently proved by the past
aggressive history of that country. But
it is vain for British statesmen to think
that France will submit tamely . . . ."

"SIR,—I have observed with surprise
that some stir is being caused by
rumours of British uniforms having
been seen in Fouracre Island. I think
I can offer a satisfactory explanation of
the circumstance. In my capacity as
Secretary to the Society for the Regenera-
tion of Fouracre Islanders, I have from
time to time superintended the sending
out of parcels of clothing contributed by
the generosity of the public. In the
last parcel, if my memory do not deceive
me, there were among other things a
few old policemen's tunics, acquired, I
believe, at a sale of theatrical properties
and presented to the Society. It is
highly probable that these are the
uniforms in question.

MR. PUNCH invites sympathy for the
unique case of an "aged gentleman"
who has lately advertised in one of the
Service journals for a Hospital Valet.
"His health," says the advertisement,
he explains, "is perfectly good, but he
has been severely injured, by the up-
setting of an express train in his legs."
AN official denial has been given to
the rumour that M. PELLETAN'S marine
pronouncements were in the nature of
a Gallon d'Orsay.

MR. Louts BECKE lias for some years been writing fact and
fiction based on his experience in the South Sea Islands.
His latest work, The Strange Adventure of James Shervinton
(FiSHER UNWIN) shows that his hand has not lost its cunning
nor the Pacific its freshness of adventure. His story dates
back thirty years, when the South Sea, Islands were harried
by a piratical horde of white men who added slave-stealing
to other avocations. It is a striking coincidence, happening
at a time when the world is still shuddering at the earth-
quake in Martinique, tliat Mr. BECKE should close his story
with a powerfully written description of a similar calamity,
which rids him of some of his characters at a time when
their continued existence becomes embarrassing.
The Eton Glossary, by C. R. STONE (SPOTTISWOODE & Co.,
LTD.). Whether this little book will be used by the new
boy on his first arriving at Eton, or whether it will be
included in their curriculum by tutors engaged in prepar-
ing the youthful TOMMIES and HARRIES for entrance into
Lower Fourth Form life, the Baron is unable to forecast,
but that it will interest a considerable number of Old
Etonians is, he ventures to think, highly probable. To the
Old Etonian who, in respect to the enjoyment of Eton
reminiscences, is as young as ever he was, this little
dictionary of Etonian Dialect "as she is spoke" is most
interesting and amusing. "Hcec olim meminisse juvabit."
What memories to an Etonian of some fifty-five summers
do not such terms as "After six," "Bill," "Athens,"
"Brocas," "Call," "Check-night," and "Construe," cum
multi.i aliis, recall! To many ancient Etonians the more
modern terms will be unfamiliar, as indeed to the Baron
nre many that must have been in common use in his own
time, when, under the rule first of HAWTREY, then of
GOODFORD, he, the Baron, was in statu pupillari sub WILLIAM
CIFFARD COOKESI.EY, the kindest and most eccentric of
"tutors," as he was one of the most exacting of Fifth Form
Masters. To many an Oppidan most of the purely
"College" terms and phrases in this Glossary will be
entirely new.
The "leaves" (meaning "leave to go away for a
holiday") mentioned in the Glossary were unknown in
the Baron's time. "Leaves" in his book were mere
leaflets to those now granted; such, for example, as " Lord's
leave," when the Cricket Public School matches are on; for
"Henley," when the boats contend; for " Bisley," when the
Rifle-boys gain their marks; and for "Winchester," when
the P^tonian Eleven plays the Wykehamite team. Are the
boys more studious now than formerly? More athletic than
in days of yore? No; the Baron believes that the Etonian of
to-day differs not one whit from the Etonian of yesterday, or
from the Etonian of many yesterdays long ago. Etonians
of all ages, wherever they may be, will "Swing, swing
together," as the boating song has it, though by the way,
personally the Baron objects to the word "swing"; yet,
after all, if the alternative expression "hang" be substi-
tuted, the sentiment is equally true, as they will "hang
together" and do a good turn one to the other, strangers
though they be, on the strength of "the friend in need"
being an "Old Etonian." Presumably this sentiment is
common to all great schools, and is a true and honest one;
a sentiment without any sentimentalism.

One note more. On re-opening the Glossary the Baron
comes on the word "Tick," and he reads, " This is gradually
dying out at Eton." Alas! Is there no longer faith to be
placed in Etonian promises? Have tradesmen grown unkind?
Has the Etonian tradesman assumed "Ready, aye ready"
as his business motto, thereby signifying "Terms cash
only "? If this be so, then the Baron is a genuine laudator
temporis acti, when payment of coin over the counter was
the exception, not the rule. Be this as it may, the Baron,
drinking to the prosperity of Eton and the health of the
precious STONE who has compiled The Eton Glossary, con-
cludes with "Floreat Etona!" and may it not be long ere
HENRY'S holy shade is revisited, as ghosts revisit the glimpses

BEAUTY'S DAUGHTERS.
[One of the Indies' journals has jmt published a "Secret* of Beauty
Number," in which much stress is laid on the duty of cultivating beauty as
distinct from the vulgar habit of " making up."]
SCENE—The School of Beauty.
Professor. Ladies, Woman should be fair—
"Tis the aim of her existence—
And when Nature 'gins to wear
Let her summon Art's assistance.
Therefore, ladies, 'tis your duty
To attend the School of Beauty.
First Student. Yes, the Professor's right. She does not lie.
I would be beautiful.
Second Student. And I.
AH. And I.
Let us start without delay,
Beautifying as we may
Features, figure, hands, and bust—
'Tis our duty, and we must.
Let us Romanise our noses,
Round our chins, and blush like roses,
Let us learn the master's skill—•
'Tis our duty, and we will.
First Student. Take, oh take these lines away
That so deeply have been worn,
And these hairs so flecked with grey,
Signs that tell when I was born;
But my dimples bring again,
Bring again;
Lures of love that lured in vain,
Lured in vain.
Professor. This, Madam, will I gladly do;
I '11 see that each beholder
Shall set you down at twenty-two,
And not a moment older.
Come, listen! In the foremost place
Beware of soap and water,
For this is how to wash your face,
My daughter, 0 my daughter.
You take this paste and rub it well
On any part that's skinny—
Enormous quantities I sell:
The price is half-a-guinea—
For twenty minutes massage in
With circular slow motion,
Then carefully anoint the skin
With this, my Sovereign Lotion.
Next dab with Satin Cream: it's nice
And cools the face. A spot '11
Be quite sufficient, and the price
Is six-and-six a bottle.
Then take a wax cloth (two-and-nine)
And polish your complexion,
And it will be as fair as mine—
In other words1—perfection.
First Student. What! is this all I have to do
To make my skin "wax satin," too,
The texture all admire in you—
So tender, natural and true?
Professor. And for the hair, which makes you old,
This wash—'tis not a dye—is sold;
Apply a little, and behold!
The«un has kissed your love-locks gold.
Second Student. Enough for her. What can you do for me?
In every other item, as you see,
My beauty 's perfect, but—and here 's the rub—
My nose is what the vulgar call a snub.
Professor. 0, that can be managed without
A doubt;
I 've a neat little instrument here,
My dear,
Which I fit on the nose,
And it thereupon grows
To the nose you would have it appear.
Of fashions I '11 show you a score,
And more;
I can make it whatever you please
With ease—
• Any pattern that you say,
Greek, Roman, retrousse,
And all at the lowest of fees.
Second Student. Give me the fashion book, and let me see.
Eureka! Here is just the nose for me.
Professor. Your taste is perfect, Madam, for you choose
The "Aphrodite." Let me turn the screws.
It will not hurt you, though it looks alarming.
There! How is that? You like it?
Second Student. Charming!
All. Charming!
Professor. Come, ladies! To your mirrors haste away,
And let us get to work without delay.
Chorus of Students.
The new regime of Satin Cream
We hasten to begin;
We '11 round our face to forms of grace
With pegs for nose and chin;
Our fading hair we '11 lave with care
In simple, harmless wash,
And if you cry that it is dye,
We only answer " Bosh!'
For this distinction try
To see with single eye:
We sink to no
Such habits low—
We wash—we do not dye.
And next we start with simple art
To brighten up our eyes;
Our lashes, too, we change in hue —
But note! we use no dyes.
If used with skill, a tonic will
Make any eye-brows grow,
And if you cry, it's "make-up," why,
We only answer "No!"
For this distinction try
To see with single eye:
Such wicked arts
Offend our hearts—
We simply beautify.

"A NICHT Wl' BURNS.'
TO MARTHA IN MASSACHUSETTS.
THE sun of whom the poets sing we see him less than they did;
The beams he tricked so bravely once are miserably faded;
And where we tramped the stubble-fields with early exultation
The tardy corn bears witness to the god's degeneration.
Our longitude has gone astray, our latitude's perplexing;
Barometry 's a patent sham, thermometry 's as vexing;
And soon the Polar Times will tell, with other chilly topics,
How some new NAXSEN died of frost who tried to find the
tropics.
Our coal-supplies are giving out: it isn't strikes that kill
them;
We drain our cellars every day, and every day we fill them.
So heap the fires with crackling logs, but while you heap
remember
You '11 have to keep a steady blaze from now to next
September.
It's all the sun, the sulky sun, the sun who fails to dye blue
The inky tracts of upper air he used to keep so sky-blue.
He lets the fog come creeping up, and, though the churl
could do it,
He never tries to draw his bow and send an arrow through it.
But still for this I owe him thanks :—that lately, as he rolled
round,
Obscured from every anxious eye, to take his daily cold round,
He roused him from the lethargy that seems to suit his dim age,
And took a smiling look at you, and printed off your image.
That's how I have your photograph: you only sent me one,
Miss;
I 'd like to have a dozen such and all as nicely done, Miss.
I 'd frame them all in silver frames and place them with the
few sets
Of photographs of equal rank with this from Massachusetts.
Now if the sun should still be hid I think I can defy him:
He little thought when printing you your i'ace could thus
supply him.
One point, a point of mere detail, awaits your prompt
decision :—
Why not come over here yourself,rand oust your printed
vision? R. C. L.
"BOZ AND BOULOGNE" NOTES.
A PROPOS of "Boz and Boulogne " [for which overhaul a
certain number of Mr. Punch's hebdomadal series, for Sep-
tember 17, p. 188] mention was made of Mons. F. BEAUOODRT,
the landlord of CHAHLES DICKENS, when the latter occupied
a house close to Boulogne. From M. le Ch&telain DE DARDELOT
I have received some interesting information. When writing
"Boz and Boulogne" it was difficult to reconcile CHARLES
DICKENS'S own statements in his letters, as to the position of
his house just outside Boulogne, on the heights, with the
position of the country place pointed out to me, as the
latter, being a good six miles south of Boulogne, could not
have had a back door opening on to a path within a short
walk of "The Column" (a point that everybody at all
acquainted with Boulogne Jfnows), unless the estate
extended from Condette to that site, which it doesn't now,
and never did. Monsieur F. BEAUCOURT had a house north
of Boulogne-sur-Mer, where CHARLES DICKENS visited occa-
sionally, and he possessed also a small country homestead at
Hardelot (this is the place indicated as above mentioned),
south of Boulogne, where he spent a portion of the summer.
On one occasion CHARLES DICKEKS, having been invited by
Monsieur BEAUCOURT to the Hardelot "Bungalow," the
visitor was so delighted with the air, the view, and the quiet
of the place (I personally can testify to the excellence of all
three), that he remained there a few days (sending to his
house north of Boulogne for a supply of clothes, books
and papers), and later on returned there. Of this fact,
vouched for by my good friend the Chatelain, I cannot
find any mention in CHARLES DICKENS'S letters: yet as
some of his interviews with M. BEAUCOURT, either recorded
in full or alluded to in these letters, may have taken
place during one of these visits, it is quite likely that
CHARLES DICKEKS, to whom a walk of five or six miles was
but as a matter of a few paces would be to an ordinary
pedestrian of sedentary occupations, neither jotted down the
locale of the interview, nor made any mem. as to his brief
stay.
It will be interesting, not only to the members of the Boz
Club, but to all Dickensians, to learn that in the village of
Hardelot are several persons possessing little souvenirs
given to their parents by CHARLES DICKENS; mere trifles,
such as a picture frame or a book, and so forth, treasured
by them as precious relics.
The Mayor of Condette, M. E. HURET-LAGACHE, now a hale
and hearty octogenarian, remembers conversing with DICKENS
between 40 and 50 years ago, in M. BEAUCOURT'S country
house at Hardelot. Perhaps the Boz Club, of which Lord
JAMES OF HEREFORD is the distinguished President, might
like to choose Hardelot and Condette for a Dickensian
pilgrimage next spring-time? It is a mere suggestion.
What a pity it is, and what a loss to us now, that the idea
never occurred to CHARLES DICKENS of taking Mr. Pickwick,
Snodgrass, Winkle and Tupman, and Sam Weller, over to
France! An imitator, one G. W. M. REYNOLDS, did presume
to write a book entitled Pickwick Abroad. It was a hopeless
failure. Imagine the impudence!
"A PROGRESSING PILGRIM."
P.S.—" A Progressing Pilgrim" begs to thank numerous
correspondents who have so kindly sent him various inter-
esting details for which he regrets that space is not avail-
able in these "Notes," which here come to an end. A
paragraph from one letter, however, I may quote to the
effect that " DICKENS did not occupy a house on the Calais
Road," and the writer adds, "even FOESTER'S definition is
hardly accurate." This, in a measure, confirms what has
been written by the "P. P." above as to the site of CHARLES
DICKENS'S house.

CONVERSATIONAL PITFALLS.
"Do YOU REMEMBER KlTTT FOWLER I"
"OH, YOU MUST REMEMBER KlTTY. SHE WAS THE PLAINEST GIRL IN TORQUAY.
Her Friend. "No, I DON'T.''
BUT I FOROOT—THAT WAS AFTER YOU LEFT!'
"EVER THE BEST OF FEIENDS, PIP?"
IF Tlie Best of Friends is not the best of titles for a
Dmriolanian melodrama, at all events its author, Mr. CECIL
RAI.EIOH, has given Manager ARTHUR COLLINS some of the
best of opportunities for gratifying the tastes of a sensation-
loving and spectacular - piece - admiring public. A more
Affective banquet scene than the one in the " Duke's Hall"
lias rarely, if ever, been seen on any stage, and when Sir
EESRY IRVING appears at this Home of the National Drama
t is to be hoped that, should Macbeth be produced, Mr.
?OLLINS will pay special attention to the great Banquet-sans-
Banquo scene in Macbeth. The final tableau, where the
action is supposed to take place in the upper gallery and in
the room under the roof of a lofty music-hall, is a triumph
of stage-management.
There is one strong situation which is as telling in action
is it is original in design. Fortunately it is in the capable
lands of Mrs. JOHN WOOD, who, with her sudden transitions
rom broad humour to pathos, and from fierce invective to
rollicking fun, proves herself, for the hundredth time, a
Mst-mistress of her art, and skilled comedian of wonderful
resource.
Mr. SYDNEY VALENTINE'S rendering of the Boer General,
not a very popular character with the public at the present
noment, is notably £ne; his elocution is perfect, and
s acting worthy of a better part in a better piece.
Mr. C. M. LOWNE is, every inch of him, and he must be
quite a six-footer, the somewhat eccentric Duke of Rich-
orauqh, who at one moment with effusive politeness and
hanning cordiality invites an entire second-rate circus
Company to his house, and the next, rudely, nay, most
abusively, kicks them out. The young Earl, assuming the
haughty and irascible aristocrat, he wno wins the hand of
Mercia de Marco (a gentle-mannered young lady in the
slack-wire and acrobatic line, quietly played by Miss DANKS)
finds a gallant representative in Mr. REEVES-SMITH, while his
college chum, Paul de Lahne, a young Boer, who has been
sent up to Oxford as the seat of Lahne-ing, is admirably
impersonated by Mr. CONWAY TEARLE. As the jovial soldier-
servant, afterwards valet, Mr. HERBERT STANDING does good
service; and Mrs. RALEIGH once again takes on her shapely
shoulders a fair share of the heavy burden of villainy where-
of the remainder is borne by that accomplished scoxindrel,
dramatically speaking, Mr. IVAN BERLYN as Eketo/, who is to
Mr. SYDNEY HOWARD'S Emmanuel Reo very much what, in the
well-known melodrama, Robert Macaire is to Jacques Strop.
It is all effective, and the audience testify to its popularity,
of which no small portion is due to the musical ingenuity,
the dramatic appreciation, and undaunted energy of that
enlightening conductor, Mr. J. M. GLOVER, whose "mailed
fist," with a baton in it, conducts his men through tortuous
tangles of musical sympathy with suffering mortality, strong
in brass, forcible in wind, sobbing in pizzicato string-pincli-
ing, they emerge, happy and glorious, in a grand burst of
National Anthem.
Supposing the entire corps dramatiqiie to have lost their
voices, could not the whole story be told in dumb show,
to Mr. J. M. GLOVER'S sympathetically descriptive music?
Nay, could not Mr. GLOVER tell it all himself with his own
action, semaphorically speaking? The suggestion is worth
the consideration of Mr. ARTHUR COLLINS. The drama has
come to stay till Christmas, when enters King Pantomime,
and then even "The Best of Friends must part."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
SOUTH AFRICAN PROSPECTS.
OUR Johannesburg correspondent begs
us to impress upon any of our readers
intent on going to South Africa that the
state of things out there is somewhat
unsettled and discouraging.
Would-be colonists should note par-
ticularly that it has been almost impos-
sible, since the end of the War, for
anyone to earn a living without working
for it—unless a Boer both by birth and
by lack of education. Determined
emigrants are warned not to come out,
at present, if blind, crippled, idiots, or
similarly incapable, such misfortunes
being likely to afford able-bodied com-
petitors a distinct advantage over them.
Our correspondent particularly nrges
(and his high position in the political
world should lend weight to bis
opinions)—
1. That emigrants should bring with
them sufficient money to maintain them-
selves for a few weeks, seeing that
salaries are not paid to strangers in
advance.
2. That they should have some sort
of reference or written character.
(Even ex-irregulars should observe this
rule, their previous service not being
considered sufficient guarantee of moral
perfection to satisfy local requirements.)
3. That they should likewise bring
enough bricks and mortar to build a
house, the present output of such
materials in the Colony not being large
enough to meet the Boer demands—
much less those of loyalists or ex-
Uitlanders.
4. That they should also provide
themselves—if desirous of farming—
with such accessories as haystacks, oxen,
families, barns, grain, waggons, labour-
ers, Rinderpest cure and Tse-tse-fly-
papers. With these few effects in hand,
the country provides exceptionally hope-
ful prospects to farmers and stock-
breeders.
The emigrant is further recommended
to acquaint himself with the elements
of the Kaffir language, customs and
general mode of life, and to study their
comfort, so that no ignorance on his
part—which is now unaccepted as an
excuse in the criminal courts—may lead
him to commit any heinous offences
against his dusky superiors. Many a
well-meaning stranger has found him-
self thrust into irons for using offensive
language or threatening actual violence
to a poor nigger [this expression must
have l>een overlooked by the Kaffir
censor] who had, through mere inad-
vertence, barged him into the gutter.
The English seem inclined to imagine
that a condition of society exists to-day
similar to that enjoyed before the
Anglo-Boer war, when the blacks held
a position of equality with, or even

Grandma. "DEAR ME! SPENT ALL THAT SIXPENCE IN CHOCOLATES! THINK HOW MUCH
NICER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE HAD IT STILL EEP08INO IN YOUB POCKET."
Wil it (regrelfuUy). "YES, IT WOULD."
Grandma (teeing an opportunity of inculcating a moral'). "TELL ME WHY, NOW."
Willie. "OH, so THAT I COULD oo OUT AND BUY SOME MORE, GRANDMA!"
subservience to, the white population of
the South African Republics.
A deplorable state of destitution exi;ts
throughout the country. Many miners
from Cornwall or Wales have already
had to give up such extras as green
peas out of season and mid-day cham-
pagne. Our readers should also bear in
mind that clothes, as well as eatables,
are exorbitantly expensive. Clerks may
be seen, nowadays, going to their offices
in common felt hats or turning up at
the club to dinner without evening
dress. The approximate cost of living
is as follows :—
Per week.
Apartments, with window .£110
,, ,, with table,
chair, and bed complete
(pictures extra).... 220
Board (plain) 330
„ (ad lib.) 550
„ (with attendance) not available.
Lights, bed-clothes, use of hat-rack
and umbrella-stand, wear and tear of
floors, table-cloth, cutlery, condiments,
water (beyond three pints per diem),
are charged extra. Most trades and
professions are overcrowded in the new
colonies. There is, however, a great
dearth of aeronauts, dancing-masters,
and publishers.
A NOMINAL ASSOCIATION.
AT the meeting of the Library Asso-
ciation in the Council Chamber on
Tuesday, September 23, among many
distinguished speakers, Mr. GUPPY, re-
presenting JOHN ELAND'S Library, arose
to "emphasise the extreme importance
of proper collation." Quite the true
Guppian spirit! Who among the
readers of Bleak House will not at once
call to mind the celebrated "collation,"
a most " proper collation?" It was pro-
vided at mid-day at the "Slap-Bang"
eating-house by the hospitable GUPPY to
his friends SMALLWEED and JOBLING, whose
names, it is a matter of regret to notice,
are absent from the record of this meet-
ing in the Birmingham Council Cham-
ber. Where was the susceptible SMALL-
WEED, with his monkeyish ways, and the
hungry but lively JOBLING, who per-
formed his task (of dining) silently,
"getting over the ground in excellent
style, and beating Messrs. SMALLWEED
and GUPPY easily by a veal and ham
and a cabbage." Although "such a
meeting as this" (of old friends) would
have "made amends" for much, yet it
is something once again to see the
Dickensian name of GUPPY coming to
the front in so good a cause as that of
a " collation."

worn long this year."
"Yet yours appear to be moderately
substantial."
"Mine? Oh, ah. Yes. Mine. Yes.
But of course what may be excellent
taste in an Eagle, in a Lion on the
other hand"
"The question," observed the Lion
with some hauteur, "of what is and is
not suitable for Lions is one to which I
have devoted a long, and, I trust, not
unprofitable lifetime."
And with a thoughtful look upon his
mobile countenance he resumed the
congenial task of sharpening the criti-
cised members on the trunk of a local tree.

THE PLAY AND THE BOOK.
[Mr. HALL CAINE U here suppoied as reluctantly consenting to receive an
interviewer during the performance of his melodrama at His Majerty's
Theatre. The writer of these verses acknowledge* his indebtedness to
"M. W." for the account of a similar interview in the Pall Mall Qazittt.]
You ask me how I did it? whence inspired
This brain achieved that wonder of womanhood
Whose lips, her anarchist lover's cause at stake,
Inform the gendarmes, so to save his life,
And make my masterpiece the thing it is?
Why, then, 'twas just a story came my way,
Not ben trovato (how the language clings !)
But vero—chronicled fact, base ore i' th' rough
That craved the crucible's refining flames.
I live the hidden life, else you had heard
Just how it fixed my fancy, this same tale,
Far back i' th' wilds of Russia, steppes and such;
Brooded above my pillow, dazed my dreams
Like fumes of vodka, gripped my -waking thoughts
So in a vice I could not throw it off.
Meanwhile the summons o' duty drew me home
Pledged to supply the imminent claims of Man;
And not alone the general human race,
Hungry to have of me the final word
On crucial phases, Christian and the like—
But the particular Man, the Island world
Nestling about the base of Greeba's towers,
Where I already moved, a thing apart,
Elect of Nature's predeterminate choice
To be the Manxman's guide against the hour
When Kings should moor their barques in Ramsay Bay!
Yet still in that loud boom o' th' market-place
And clamour o' Fame through which my hermit's mind
Went uncorrupted, I—I waited on,
Nursing the heavenly vision next my heart.
At length the way was clear; I knew at length
The instant call of Rome, and I obeyed.
And here 's my audience kindly predisposed
Since all the world has read my book, you say?
Too flattering! Call it ninety-nine per cent.!
But there 's a difference, mark, "twixt play and book,
Since Eoma dies i' th' tale, and here she lives—
A stroke of genius, though I say the word,
And illustrates the higher use of art,
How it was made for man, not man for it.
You 've seen the acting version (HEINEMANN)?
No? Yet the work's on sale i' th' intervals.
Yes, quite my own idea, not TREE'S at all.
Ah! there 's the Serenata! That's my brave
MASCAGNI! How the local colour stirs
The Roman in the restive bones of me,
Till Italy, my foster-motherland,
Throbs in my dancing veins! Once more I seem
To see the Eternal City painted red
(B.F.DEKEB'S hue); once more I seem to hold
Her inmost secrets in my hollowed hand.
Nay, nay! I 'd not divulge affairs of state,
Vatican complots, schemes o' th' Quirinal,
Concerns that touch the immediate heart of things,
Pantingly mix wi' th' moment's breathing life—
Nor let my little finger use a force
Might rudely compromise a Pope's career
For whom I entertain profound regard,
The fruit of intimate knowledge. These my actors
Are types that symbolise perennial truths,
And should retain, some thirty seasons hence,
Scarce less of import than they have to-night;
Though present principalities and powers
Meantime should drink the dust, and leave my play
Still running nicely. Hush! La Donna speaks! 0. S.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
"FROM the rapt loneliness of her cradle, from her secret
fountains where the red sundew glimmers and cotton grasses
wave unseen, Dart comes wandering southward with a song."
This is The River (METHUEN), by whose mighty stream runs,
through sunshine and storm, the thread of Mr. EDEN
PHILLPOTT'S last story. Since he refrained from giving up
to clerical duty in an insurance office what was meant
for mankind, the author of The Human Boy has been
steadily making his way in Literature. The River
places him in the front rank of living novelists. His
descriptions of Dartmoor and Dart are unequalled since
BLACKMORE ceased to paint them. The men and women,
more especially the men, with whom he peoples the
scenery, need fear no comparison with creations of the
Master. Nicolas Edgecombe, a warrener by occupation, a
simple-hearted, high-souled gentleman by every instinct, is
one of the finest characters my Baronite has come upon in tbe
fiction of the still young century. His neighbours and com-
panions in the same humble walk of life have the shrewd-
ness, simplicity and humour that mark the character
of some of SHAKSPEARE'S country louts. Attempting to
comfort the warrener in sore distress, Mr. Chugg, the water
bailiff, says :—" Us often has to look back over half a life-
time afore us can tell what Providence be up to. An' if us
could always get the bird's-eye view—which in general we
can't—us would always see Providence in the right of it."
A comforting doctrine, worthy to be laid to heart.
The scene of Anna of the Five Towns (CHATTO AND WINDUS)
is laid in the Potteries. Of this hive of industrious humanity
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT, who knows it au fond, gives a succes-
sion of striking pictures. The story is slight but admirably
told. Old Tellwright, the miser, who has scraped together
£50,000 and allots a sovereign a week for the household
expenses of two daughters and himself, is a striking piece
of portraiture. My Baronite is not drawn towards Henry
Mynors. He is much too good for human nature's daily
food. As Anna discovers before she unaccountably married
him, he is tainted with touch of the Pharisee. Anna herself,
a straightforward capable housewife, is another excellently
drawn character. The only point wherein she is disap-
pointing (save in marrying the Pharisee) is that she did not
earlier deliver herself from the thraldom of her tyrannical and
avaricious parent. They are all common people in the Five
Towns, but they are all real flesh and blood, each profoundly
interesting in his or her way.
It was a peculiarly happy thought on the part of Mr.
OWEN SEAMAN to dedicate his amusing parodies, which
having at various times appeared in Mr. Punch's pages
(chiefly under the head of The Book of Beauty) axe now
republished in one volume entitled Borrowed Plumes
(CONSTABLE), to "The Aiithors, many of them my friends"
naively explains 0. S. "whose methods I have here attempted
to imitate." A soft dedication turneth away wrath, and the
oil of genialitv is soothingly preventive of possible irrita-
bility. But that the reader will not find herein aught set
down in malice is assured, since it has received the
imprimatur of Mr. Punch, which is the best guarantee for
its wit, wisdom and good nature.
In digression, which is the better part of autobiography,
lies the charm of Mr. HERMAN MERIVALE'S Bar, Stage, and
Platform (CHATTO AND WINDUS), as he shows himself a master
of this particular art. A capital anecdote about the Bar
recalls to his mind an equally good story about the Stage or the
Platform. He has much that is amusing to say about Amateur
Theatricals: and, going off at a tangent, he records a
pleasant rejoinder of the PRINCE CONSORT to an objection
raised by the Heralds' Office, concerning certain quarterings,
which must have caused Rouge-Dragon and Co. to "sit up,"

and, as the Baron fancies, now appears
in print for the first time. Mr. MERIVALE'S
early days seem to have resembled in
some particulars those of little David
Copperfield, and here the narrative is
humorously pathetic. He recounts not a
few entertaining anecdotes of THACKERAY,
and he gives just praise to DICKENS, but
his memory plays him a trick when he
quotes from Pickwick, and tells us how
a certain incident recalled to him "the
Pickwickian episode of Prodgers and
the lantern." The "lantern" is all
right (see pp. 175—78, vol. i., Pickwick
Victoria Edition), but there is "no such
a person" as "Prodgers" on in this
particular scene, of which the hero in
question is merely mentioned as "the
scientific gentleman." Verification of
quotation would have saved Mr. MERIVALE
from this error. The author, it appears,
has seen some strange sights in his
time, as, for instance, "BFLLY WARNER"
(of Harrow), "who sold brandy balls in
a very long red coat with very large
brass buttons." At p. 276, where he
is rattling off a story about himself and
"two chums" at Monte Carlo, he con-
cludes by telling us "we pocketed our
gains, buttoned our breeches, and with-
drew, as both joy fuller and wiser men."
Had our author not been in such a
hurry he might have added " pockets"
to the " breeches," and then this passage
in the narrative would have been unex-
ceptionable. This book being, as the
Baron has already testified, full of good
things, is hereby strongly recommended
by the Faculty, whose representative is

"A VERY EXCELLENT PIECE OF VTLLONY."
Ttt. And., Act IL, Berne 3.
NOT since he "came out complete in two parts" (like a
short story) in The. Prisoner of Zenda at the St. James's has
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER been so perfectly fitted with a
character as he is with this of Francois Villon in Mr. JUSTIN
HDNTLY MCCARTHY'S successful Romantic Play, entitled // I
were King. How this line must recall to Offenbachians the
"Si j'etais Boi de Beotie, J'aural des sujets et des
soldats!" But this by the way, and Francois Vitton, King
of France for a week, having soldiers and subjects galore,
makes the best use of the former and obtains the goodwill
of the latter. King Louis THE ELEVENTH has a mysterious
dream, which none can interpret for him satisfactorily,
wherein he has seen "a star, doing something,—I could
not catch what it was,—and naturally enough (at the
St. James's at least) he beholds in Mr. ALEXANDER, as
Villon, the bright particular Theatrical Star, realising to
the full his otherwise inexplicable vision.
Now, when this "Villon of the piece "—a double-dye'd
Villon, unkempt and ragged as he appears in the first act,
and about as disreputable as villains are made—that is,
according to his own account of himself in this play, and
in ROBERT STEVENSON'S A Lodging for the Night—when this
same Villon is washed, shaved, combed, groomed, and put
into "gorgeous array," then begins a brief fantastic career
to which that of Ruy Bias, the Lacquey, is a matter of
curiously slight importance.
ALEXANDER may have other worlds (dramatic) to conquer,
but so far as a gay and gallant hero of genuine romantic
melodrama can have it all to himself ne stands alone,
triumphant. Fortunate is he too in his prima donna,
whose name, Miss JULIE OPP, as representing a charming
"ladye of high degree," is so suggestive, to any Cantab,
of the list whereon he himself may have figured as a
"Junior Op." Miss OPP is Katharine de Vaucellea, a
beautiful lady-in-waiting, and, "as everything comes to one
who waits," into her arms tumbles Franyois ViUon, poet,
politician, patriot, field marshal, conquering hero, and in
fact any number of single gentlemen rolled into one. For
dignity and sweetness commend me to Miss OPP as Katharine,
the proud and loving; but for simulation of scorn and
exhibition of violent temper commend me not to JDLIE OPP.
Impersonating the heroine she falls short of her own high
standard, as, by the way, do all persons who give way to
over-mastering fury, and so perhaps she may be artistically
right after all.
T3ut 'tis with Miss SUZANNE SHELDON, aa the boy-coated
Huguette du Hamel, that the audience sympathise. Hers is
a part most important in the drama, a part that "grows
upon you," a part that from the first rouses curiosity; for,
as Huguette madly loves Francois, and as Francois has a
soft corner in his heart for her, if he and Katharine are to
be united at the last, and everybody to be made happy, as
everybody should be in all well regulated romances, then
'tis clear that the weaker vessel, yclept Huguette, must go
to the wall. So, opportunely, she, rushing in between
Tliibaut (Mr. LYALL SWETE) and the object of his vengeance,
receives the stroke of the assassin's dagger, and becomes,
par excellence, the heroine of the play. True that Kate
offers her life to save Francois, but in doing so she is only
imitating the example of the dauntless and devoted Huguette,
who has died to save the man she loves. It is the author
who is her assassin, and in making her a martyr, he, having
no resource at his command, sacrifices to her all the interest
that his other heroine has already, temporarily, aroused.
Huguette becomes, undoubtedly, the heroine of the piece,
though this was never the author's intention. It is this
repetition of motive, this poverty of resource, that consti-
tutes the weak point of the drama, and renders the last
scene of all so comparatively uninteresting.
It is magnificently placed on the stage, the scenic artists,
Messrs. HANN and TELBIN, having given us of their best (as
indeed have all concerned in the production), and that it is
thoroughly well acted throughout, effectively stage-managed
by Mr. REYNOLDS, and fitted with appropriate music by Mr.
ROBINS, goes without saying. And that it has come to stay
for some time is a fair certainty.
"ONCE ON BOARD THE CUTTER"
"As you're a bad sailor I won't ask you to come for a
cruise, old man," said my yachting friend BACKSTAY, " but
just run down to Ryde from Saturday to Monday. I pro-
mise not even to get under way, and you '11 like the life on.
board."
I went. I did like the life on board—there was a dead
calm—feeding and cooking were excellent, the champagne
superb.
Dear old BACKSTAY!
Next morning he came into my cabin and said, "Tumble
out, old man, and we '11 go overboard."
That appeared to me rather a drastic method of taking
one's morning bath. I explained this to BACKSTAY, and he
laughed and told the Steward to bring me one of those
horrible rubber arrangements to tub in. I tried twice to
get into it, and finally rolled the whole affair (and myself)
over on the cabin floor, entirely spoiling the carpet.
Breakfast over, BACKSTAY suddenly suffered from an
inspiration.
"We "11 have the cutter out and sail down to Cowes,"
he said.
So we scrambled over the side into a cockle-shell with,
a sail in it. I was about to sit beside BACKSTAY in the stern
portion, when he said:
"No, old man, I want you more forrard — there" —
indicating a bare-board seat, which I found most unsym-
pathetic—" that trims the boat better, and you can get hold
of the sheets when I tell you."
I murmured that I didn't want any sheets—a thick
blanket, folded over several times, would have seemed much,
more attractive.
BACKSTAY sat in the stern with the string—I mean ropes
—all round about him: a hopeless-looking tangle. The
sail went flap! bang! and then suddenly the long stick—
boom, I think it is called—came flying over, hitting me
unpleasantly hard on the right ear, and hurling my cap into
the sea. Of course I had to go bareheaded aU the rest of
the morning.
Suddenly we heeled over at a frightful angle, and I
slid right down to the side. Clutching a rope, I just saved
myself from a watery grave.

"Is this —er— is this quite safe, do
you think?" I asked nervously.
"Perfectly," answered my host, never
taking his eye off the mast, which
seemed to me to bend in the most ex-
traordinary way. "Do you think our
stick is buckling?" he asked; "it's
a new one I 'm trying. Hope it won't
go-"
I would have given much to have
been able to "go" myself—ashore for
choice—especially as the wind was de-
cidedly freshening, and every now and
then a small wave jumped suddenly
into the boat.
BACKSTAY laid a hand on my shoulder.
"Sit right down in the bottom of the
boat, old man. It '11 trim her better,"
he said.
I didn't know what he meant by
"trimming," but I looked fearfully at
the four or five inches of water swashing
about, and then at my best blue serge
trousers. However, there was no help
for it, and down I sat, giving a little
gasp as the cold water first reached me.
A strong breeze suddenly sprang upon
us.
"Now we '11 go about!" cried BACK-
STAY, putting his helm hard up
"Leggo! now haul in your lee sheet—
no, no! not that! Haul in your—oh
here! catch hold of the tiller, and let
me come. Luff!—Luff!" he almost
screamed.
Now what would any man—I mean
any ordinary business man, as opposed
to these buccaneering, "yachtclubby"
seafarers—do, under such circumstances?
I tried my best—I caught hold of every
rope I could see and frantically pulled
them all—and even that seemed wrong!
And when, to crown it all, he told
me to take the tiller, and talked that
ridiculous nonsense about "luffing,"
I really felt offended. He ought to have
known that that kind of jargon would
uot appeal to me in the least.
We turned round—tacked, I mean—
somehow, but a lot more water came on
board and I got the full benefit of it, both
in my face when it arrived, and after-
wards whilst sitting in it. And then
BACKSTAY—who sat dry, par parenthese
—exclaimed with enthusiasm, "Isn't
this ripping?"
"Dripping, you mean," I replied
rather acidly. "When shall we return
to the yacht?"
"Oh', plenty of time. We can beat
back in an hour."
I don't know what he meant by
beating. All I can say is that we
never reached the yacht for three mortal
hours, and I was starving. That
unpleasant experience cost me a new
serge suit, an attack of mingled lumbago,
rheumatism, and sciatica, and a brand-
new yachting cap.

HIPPODROMAQUATIC.
A WONDERFUL Show at the London Hippodrome. Phroso
is as much a puzzle for those interested in mechanism as
must have been the Monster to the visiting friends of
Frankenstein. Odd! But the first
moment Phroso appeared his face
and manner seemed quite familiar
to me. The eyeglass was wanting,
but the absence of the orchid
was fully atoned for by the general
orchid ness of Phroso's movements.
In tliis sketch the figure is eye-
glass'd and button-holed de rigueur.
It is a pity this "Mysterious Me-
chanical Doll" does not appear in
a comic scene of dialogue with
some one in Lieutenant COLE'S
line. Phroao is taken too se-
riously: he is not yet quite accus-
tomed to London society, and his
manners are altogether too stiff,
though now and again he unbends,
on which occasions he reminds us
of the strange case of Mr. Small-
weed, who, after a fit of anger, had
to be pummelled and straightened
out before he could resume the
conversation; and so it is with
Phroso, who, being a perfectly irre-
sponsible party (and so far the re-
semblance to Joso ceases), has to be
closely watched by his exhibitor lest
he should inadvertently tumble off
the platform, or take some such
serious false step as would damage
his springs for life. Absit omen!
But Phroso is only one among
the many attractions in the sort
perpetual-emotional entertainment at the_ Hippodrome.

mentary Mechanical Figure.
Of
There are the three fascinating Sisters KI/JS in their
"Unrivalled Gymnastic Exercises," sometimes far apart,
sometimes Klos together; and there is M. SCTIAFFER the
juggler who, to his own cheek, or rather on his own
unaided chin, walks about balancing a sentry-box with a
sentry in it; finally giving a marvellous exhibition of Sentry-
fugal force by chucking away the box with a jerk of his head
and sending the soldier flying, quite appropriately, between
"the wings."
Pretty pigeons play with Mile. ELLA BRADNA, and the
"Statue Dog" belonging to Miss CHESTER, the sportswoman
in white, would delight the heart of any artist by its
immobility as a setter. This tableau is recommended to the
attention of Sir EDWARD POYNTER, P.R.A. These are a few
of the shows, eighteen in number, which are dealt out,
not in sequence, but apparently according to the exigences
of the moment, so that No. 9 may perhaps follow closely on
the heels of No. 2, and No. 4 may appear immediately
after No. 8. Thus the entertainment is full of surprises.
But the surprise of all is the New Hippodromatic sensation,
written by ALICIA RAMSAY and RUDOLPH DE CORDOVA, with
music by CARL KIEFFERT, and admirably stage-managed by
Mr. FRANK PARKER. Deeds of daring, not words. Parker
verba: "cut the cackle and come to the 'osses."
This Hippo-melo-drama is a lesson to all melodramatists.
Observe! a drama, well plotted, spiritedly acted, with such a
sensation scene in it as could not be attempted elsewhere, is
given to a delighted and excited audience (crowded from
floor to ceiling) and lasts scarcely twenty minutes! The
scene is "set" before the very eyes of the audience, the
carpenters" rising to the exceptional occasion, as does also
the water which bubbles up from the vasty deep, and is, it
may be hoped, at least lukewarm, since the entire dramatis
personce, ladies and all, including the female villain Ravanola
(capitally played by Miss MADGE GIRDLESTONE, who might be
a twin sister of Miss IRENE VANBRUGH), have to take headers,
and with the horses, plunging in off the bridge, they have,
every one of them, to swim for dear life to the subaquarian
stables and bathing-machine-dressing-rooms. The whole
company gets on swimmingly: everyone striking out his
(or her) own line for himself, thus following the noble
example of the self-sacrificing authors, who must have
struck out their own lines (by handfuls) in order to bring
the drama within the necessary limit of time and tide. With
pistols banging, guns shooting, dynamite exploding, a
Lodore-like mountain torrent rusmng down, and from under
the earth springs welling up, it is a Fire-and-Water drama
which is drawing, as it deserves to draw, all London.
Manager Moss was not in the house, or he would have
acknowledged the plaudits more rotunda. If there be
parched lips among the excited audience, there is not a
dry skin among the energetic actors, on whom' the Order
of the Bath is nightly and daily conferred. It is a per-
formance that goes swimmingly.
THE LOST ART.
AH! the art of conversation—has it fled
With the dead?
Is there no one to appreciate the mot
Or to wait with eager eyes
For the wisdom of the wise?
I am driven to surmise
It is so.
For the people of the present never stop
Talking shop;
They have idiotic hobbies which they run,
And they gabble o'er the port
Of their everlasting sport-
Monomaniacs, in short,
Everyone.
Hear the cyclists talking gradients and hills,
Brakes and spills,
Hear them adding on the mileage, till one feels,
As one listens to the sound
With a misery profound,
That_one's brain is whirling round
Like their wheels.
Then the chatter of the fishers—how it slips
From their lips!
Rod and tackle, flies and salmon —till you wish
You could drown them in the sea
Or consign them to the Dee,
Where they really ought to be
With their fish.
Nor can golfers boast of any better wit—
Not a bit!
With their bunkers and their caddies and their greens,
And approaches that have rolled,
And the halves that they have holed—
Little tales that should be told
The Marines.
Yes, the art of conversation must have fled
With the dead;
Not a single soul will listen when I start
To converse upon a line
Which is singularly fine
And peculiarly mine—
Ancient Art.

UNDER M.V.C. RULES.
["A new game called Vigoro has been invented,
which combines the characteristics of cricket and
lawn-tennis. A trial match has been arranged at
Lord's, in which many county players are to take
part, and Lord HAWKE has announced his inten-
tion of introducing it into New Zealand during his
forthcoming tour. It can be played all the year
round, and, as the ball used is of soft india-rub'ber,
equally well by both sexes. Batsmen, bowlers,
and fieldsmen are all armed with racquets."— Daily
Paptr.]
From the"Sporting Man'' of Dec. 5,1910.
.... "And so ended the first of
the five Test matches. We hold no brief
for England, but we feel that it cannot
be denied that the better side won.
Except for an hour on the first day,
when. Miss SMITH and Miss ROBINSON
were at the wickets, the New Zealanders
were completely outplayed. And this,
in spite of the fact that the luck went
dead against the home team from the
outset, for with MAcLAHEN unaUe to turn
out, and Miss JONES suffering frem acute
neuralgia, England was by no means at
its full strength. Again, during the
majority of the three days snow fell
heavily, and it is common knowledge
that LOCKWOOD is never at his best on a
snowy wicket. Indeed, we seriously
question the wisdom of the selection
committee in playing him. On his
day, it is true, LOCKWOOD is the finest
bowler in England. The peculiar twist
of his racquet which invariably precedes
an off-break is a secret which he shares
with no other fast bowler. But since
it was obvious from the outset that there
would be enow, we think the committee
should have given the place to Miss
BROWN, who rarely fails to do well on
any wicket, and is known to have a
partiality for the Lord's ground. How-
ever, England won. That is the main
point, and a victory so decisive will be
the most fitting answer to the pessimistic
letters which nave appeared repeatedly
of late in the columns of the Press.
Our players may have their off-seasons,
but, in view of this victory, it cannot
be said with any semblance of reason
that English Vigoro is degenerating.
The first of the Test-matches has added
immensely to the prestige of English
Vigoro.
In fielding we still have much to
learn from our visitors. The perform-
ance of the New Zealanders in England's
first innings, and indeed throughout
the match, was a treat to behold. Any-
thing finer than the catch by which
Miss SLOGGINSON dismissed- GILBERT
JESSOP it has never been our lot to
witness. At first sight the hit appeared
perfectly safe. The ball had all the
well-known force of Mr. JESSOP'S racquet
behind it, and, as so often happens with
soft india-rubber balls, was swerving
nastily. Miss SIOOQINSON, however,
though fully thirty yards away, and up

Mabel (soliloquising). "DEAR HE, THIS RELAXING CLIMATE MARES EVEN ONI'S
PARASOL SEEM TOO HEAVY TO HOLD!"
to her waist in a deep drift, nevertheless
contrived to extricate herself and arrest
the ball on her racquet just as it was
about to clear the ropes. A wonderful
effort, which brought down the house,
together with a small avalanche from
the roof of the pavilion.
HIRST and RHODES both appeared a
little stale. Playing since January
without a break has had its effect on
the two Yorkshire cracks, though their
deliveries never looked easy. By a
curious coincidence each secured his
thousandth wicket this season in his
first over.
In conclusion we have to thank the
committee of the M.V.C. and Ground
for their treatment of the Press repre-
sentatives. The new stoves in the Press
Box are an excellent innovation. We
wish we could express equal praise for
certain of the other arrangements in
force at Lord's. The growing habit of
stopping the game at five o'clock for .;
hot potatoes interval is the curse of
modern Vigoro. It annoys the specta-
tors, and is quite unnecessary.
UNDER the head of "Varieties" the
Glasgow Evening Citizen makes the
following statement:
"Temperance has been promoted in the fer de
lance, the most deadly snake in the world."
Light, however, is thrown on this dark
saying by a subsequent paragraph to
this effect:
"The recent eruption has rid Martinique of the
French Army by controlling the canteen and
substituting coft'ee, tea, and cocoa for intoxica'.ing
drinks."

At Harvard every student's room is a

THE SCHOLAR GIPSIES;

AN "AMERICAN MOTHER," shocked by
the dinginess and dirt of an under-
graduate's room at Oxford which she
visited in the "Long," asks in the
Times, " Ought I to subject a lad, after
four years of student life at Harvard, in
rooms hung with fresh yet inexpensive
paper, carpeted with soft-toned rugs,
furnished with perfect simplicity, but
with regard to comfort and cleanliness,
to the squalor of such rooms as I was
shown?" Criticism has also been passed
on the absence of bath-rooms in the
Oxford Colleges. From the mass of
correspondence provoked by these pro-
tests we select the following letters:—
0. B. writes :—What can the Ameri-
can lady expect if she selects her
University so unintelligent!}'? Such is
the cleanliness of the rooms at Cam-
bridge that men are in the habit of
taking their meals off the floor. On his
last visit to his old college Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT compared it to a new pin. It
is surely notorious that both Universi-
ties once sported the same colours, but
that owing to its objection to soap and
water Oxford's ribbon became dark?

of it beyond its pungent odour, by
which it may be traced for many miles.
IN the French military term for

seems that some explanation is to be
found for M. PELLETAN'S "blazing indis-

CHARIVARIA.
WE are glad to hear that the Korean
EMPEROR, who recently died, is now
quite well.
The Tobacco War has entered on a
new phase. The American and British
Companies have now combined to attack
the consumer.
This year's Lord Mayor's Show should
be a noble pageant, for Sir MARCUS
SAMUEL is a Spectacle Maker.
As though times were not already
bad enough for artists, Mr. RUDYARD
KIPLISG has now taken to illustrating
his own books. The artists are up in
arms about it, and it is reported that,
by way of retaliation, several intend to
take lessons in spelling with a view to
writing the text for their own drawings
in the future.
Captain WELLS has had the effrontery
to refuse to obey the orders of the
Daily Mail and resign. Onlookers are
holding their breath and wondering
what will happen.
The Captain, it is said, will insist
on a Chief Officer for the City being
appointed, who must be a naval man.
Others hold that it is more important
that such officer should be used to fire
than water. A naval officer who has
been under fire would, we should say,
be the ideal.
Realism has never been carried quite
so far at Drury Lane as in the present
drama. One day last week a British
shell that was intended to demolish a Boer
hut burst prematurely and injured five
Englishmen, and the War Office is said to
have registered a protest against actual
incidents of the War being reproduced.
The fact that no photograph of Miss
EDNA MAT has been published in the

to a misunderstanding in the editorial
department. Steps have been taken to
rectify the error, and it is understood that
several of Miss MAY'S portraits will appear
as usual in all subsequent numbers.
Despite the close secrecy that was
Ereserved on the subject, information
•aked out, before the opening night, to
the effect that the author of The Eternal

a retired life in the Isle of Man) is said
to have written several books.
THE WORLD'S LOSS.
I FEEL that I was formed to sweep
The heart-strings of the human race—
Nay, more—my power could overleap
The utmost bounds of time and space:
The fires of inspiration play
About my frame from head to heel;
I feel—well, I can hardly say
Exactly how it is I feel.
Can one suppose no man was meant
To strike a nobler, loftier note
Than that which left the world content
When SHAKSPEAKE, or when MILTON
wrote?
Banish the thought! The nations cry
For such an one, if such there be;
Nor shall they cry in vain, for I
Am confident that I am he.
Yet just at present, I confess,
I cannot grant my fellow-men
Hope of immediate happiness
From any effort of my pen—
Upon its point the quivering ink
Hangs impotent in weary doubt,
Because I simply cannot think
Of anything to write about.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
A "VERY-NEARLY" STORY.
(Not at all ly Mr. Rudyard Kipling.)
ONCE upon a time—not very long ago
—an Eminent Writer met a Modern
Child.
"Approach, Best-Beloved," said the
Eminent Writer, "come hither, oh
'scruciating idle and pachydermatous
phenomenon, and I will tell you a
'trancing tale!"
The Modern Child regarded him with
mild curiosity. '' Feeling a bit chippy?"
he asked, "slight break in the brain-
box? Or why do you talk like that ?—
No, can't stop now, I 'm sorry to say."
'' But you must, Best-Beloved! You 've
got to, oh, 'satiable Chimpanzee! Can't
you see that I 'm an Eminent Writer,
talking in this way on purpose to please
you? And you don't even know how
the RUDDIKIP got His Great Big Side!
Do stop and listen!"
"Oh, anything you like," said the
Modern Child, sitting down weariedly.
"Let me light a cigarette. Now, drive
ahead!"
"Down at the back of beginning, oh
extremely Precious, there was a little
RUDDIKIP. And he was the most
'defatigable creature that anyone ever
knew. There never was a creature so
specially and 'scusably 'defatigable.
And first he grew several Tails, which
the 'defatigable RUDDIKIP said were
Plain, but all the other creatures said
were highly-coloured, and very fine
indeed. Then he made many other
inventions in the day's work, and sang
songs too, and everybody agreed that
there never was such a 'defatigable
RUDDIKIP, and his little side began to
grow — 'cause he couldn't help it.
'Cept when he tried a Light that Failed;
then he got a hump instead. So, Best-
Beloved, the 'defatigable RUDDIKIP
pleased all the big people and creatures,
and they all shouted out 'Hurrah!
Well-done!' just as loud as ever they
could shout. Then he said:
"' I have pleased the big people; it
behoves me to do something for the
rising generation of muddied oafs'—
which was the way the RUDDIKIP talked
after his Side was grown big. So next
he said a pretty piece about a most
'strordinary STORKY & Co., but the
young muddied oafs only said, 'Pah!
Bah! Pooh!'—which hurt the feelings
of the RCDDIKIP. 'Sons of the Spuming
Spring-tide!' he snorted (and no one
knew what was meant) 'I will now turn
to the Small Children, and I shall ad-
dress them in decapitated polysyllables.'
"Wherefore and 'cordingly, oh Best-
Beloved , the most and-altogether-beyond-
record-'defatigable RUDDIKIP took his
little pen, and he wrote. Then they
took the writing of the 'defatigable
RUDDIKIP, and put it in beautiful, big
black print. For they knew, oh
Approximately Invaluable, that this is
the kind of talk you like, and that you
would thank the RUDDIKIP ever so
much for tales written just in this way!"
"Chuck it!" said the Modern Child,
as he rose and fled.
THE NEWEST MODEL.
"Quern Jupiter vult perdere, prius dementat."
ARMY ORDER. VERY SPECIAL.
War Office, All Fools' Day, 1903.
PAST endeavours to attract recruits of
the desired quality and in the numbers
hoped for having lamentably failed, the
following revised regulations for the
conciliation of the private soldier are
now issued for the guidance of all
concerned.
1. The period of drill shall not exceed
thirty minutes per diem, to be fixed
at such time of day as shall be most
convenient to the majority of privates
interested.
2. No private having engagements of
his own at the time fixed for any drill—
all arrangements in accordance with
Clause I. of these Regulations notwith-
standing—shall be required to attend
at such drill.
3. Any private in whose opinion it is
likely to rain, hail, or snow during the
period fixed for any drill shaft be
excused from attending on his stating
such opinion to the officer or non-
commissioned officer in command.
4. Any private who may consider
himself aggrieved or insulted by the
behaviour towards him of the officer
or non-commissioned officer in charge of
the drill, may fall out.
5. Any private who is bored by drill
may fall out.
6. Privates proceeding to the ranges
for the purpose of musketry training
shall be conveyed thither—otherwise
than by railway—»in breaks provided at
the expense of the officer in charge of
the party, who shall also be required to
furnish at his own expense the requisite
cornets-a-piston, flags, and beer.
7. Any private finding it inconvenient
to himself to attend musketry training
shall be excused therefrom. Should he
fail in becoming efficient in musketry
for any year, his company commander
will be severely punished.
8. Every private shall be allotted a
separate bed and sitting-room in barracks
to himself on joining, to be furnished
according to his tastes, but at the public
expense. He shall also be allotted a
valet to himself, and a housemaid and
commissionaire shall be provided for
each group of privates at the public
expense.
9. Every private shall be provided
with a latch-key into barracks on join-
ing. Should he consider it undesirable
to return to barracks for any night, he
may put up at the best hotel in the
town where his regiment is quartered,
his bill for supper, bed, and breakfast,
but not for luncheon, to be charged to
the commanding officer of his regiment.
10. All privates shall be ex offieio
honorary members of the officers' mess.
Meals taken there shall be defrayed at
the public expense, but light refresh-
ments, cigars, &c., shall be charged to
the commanding officer of the regiment.
11. In order to promote good feeling
between all ranks of the service, com-
pany commanders, or, in the event of
their becoming insolvent, their subal-
terns, shall be required to furnish each
private of their respective companies
with such pocket monies as he shall
see fit.
12. Every private who may be dis-
satisfied with any of the provisions of
this order, or the manner of their being
acted on by his officers, may send in a
confidential" report (A.F. X.X.X. 1001)
to the Secretary of State for War, who
will at once attend to it.
It is desired to impress on command-
ing officers and their subordinates how
important the survival of the private
is to the well-being of the Army,
and of those answerable for him to the
nation. The degrading and detrimental
habit hitherto prevalent of treating him
as though he were merely a senior public-
schoolboy or University undergraduate,
and not innately endowed with an
intelligence considerably beyond his
years, must therefore no longer be
tolerated. Commanding officers and
others, while in no wise abating their
zeal for the smartness and efficiency of
the British Army, must not allow such
zeal, by over-ruling any of their men's
most cherished ideals, to endanger the
maintenance on paper of a sufficient
number of private soldiers to preserve
the peace of the tax-payer.
(Signed) BR-DR-CK.
Secretary of State for War AND
Commandewn-Chief.
THE Daily Mail of October 3, in its
notice of the new play at His Majesty's,
speaks of "Mr. TELBIN'S palace, with
St. Peter's in the background, and
Mr. BARKER'S studio, with the Coliseum
seen through the wide window." The
courtesy of these two gentlemen in
lending their respective properties for
the purposes of reproduction cannot be
too much commended.
SUGGESTION.—Offer a prize for the best
verses on tobacco in the form of cigars,
cigarettes, or varieties for pipe-smoking.
Let the successful competitor receive the
degree of " Bacca-Laureat."

THE EFFECT OF THE "PANAMA" CEAZE ON THE
"STOVE-PIPE" HAT.
DUKE, A DRAY-HORSE.
ONLY a horse! But who can well decide
How much was lost when Duke, the dray-horse, died?
Mildness inborn and honesty untaught,
Majestic patience and sagacious thought,
Faith that endured and love that knew n<5 end—
Such was old Duke, our huge and dappled friend.
Oft have I seen him pacing on his way,
Single, or paired with Paladin, the bay,
Now on the level, calm and debonair,
His shaggy forelock tossing in the air,
Now, his neck stretched, his breathing quick and deep,
With pointed forehoofs clawing up the steep,
Till, when the top was won, he 'd pause and seem
A mammoth spectre in a cloud of steam.
The little children marked with wondering eyes
His swelling muscles, his gigantic size,
Forsook their sports to flock about his knees,
And pat and smooth him while he stood at ease.
Then Duke, refreshed and resolute and gay,
Leaned to his work once more and drew the dray.
How firm his footfalls, while the noisy load
Came rumbling after, struck the echoing road!
How, without effort, mightily he moved,
Joyous and proud and grand and unreproved;
For all he knew of whips was this in brief:—
They sometimes cracked and sometimes flicked a leaf.
Let others flinch—he could not be afraid
On whose broad back no lash was ever laid.
And when at eve within his stall he stood,
Massive but tired, and munched his simple food,
His body cool, his legs washed down and dried,
His honest forehead in his headstall tied,
While on the air the rhythmic sound was borne
Of steady teeth all grinding at the corn—
If, on his rounds, his well-loved driver came,
Patted his flank and softly called his name,
Straight, making room, he shifted on his bed,
And pricked his ears and lifted up his head,
And, strong in love as in his gesture meek,
Laid his soft nose against the man's rough cheek.
Still, when the slow withdrawing step was heard,
He looked and mutely asked another word;
Then the sound faded and the horse was fain
With one deep sigh to turn and munch again.
Next to this friend, throughout his hours of rest
One little comrade always pleased him best,
A stunted cat, a cat so inky-black
She seemed a blot upon his good grey back,
Where oft in meditation rapt she lay,
Kneading his skin, and purred the time away.
Nor did she fail to bring her kittens all
For Duke's approval to the straw-laid stall:
Kind in her purpose, in her method rough,
She seized her vocal offspring by the scruff,
And laid them one by one, an offering meet,
In anxious triumph at her playmate's feet,
Who looked and snuffed and wondered what they were,
And gazed again, but never hurt a hair.
True to the end and staunch, whate'er befell,
Farewell, strong body, gentle heart farewell!
Service and zeal and kindliness and sense—
You gave them all, nor craved a recompense;
But, proud to own and quick to understand
The trifling tribute of a flattering hand,
Toiled at your task with undivided mind,
Grateful for this :—if only men were kind.
So if I let my pleasant fancies stray
Beyond the limit of your earthly day,
Grand as in life, old friend, I see you stand
Cropping sweet clover in a happy land,
Where no hills tire, no granite gives you pain,
But grass grows deep and all is level plain,
With spreading trees to make a green retreat,
And rippling streams to cool your unshod feet;
And not a fly, howe'er the heat increase,
To move your tail or mar your perfect peace. R. C. L.
THEY were talking of a friend whose University career
had not been^a distinguished success.
"I saw him the other day," observed first Clubman to
t'other, "and he looked very much aged. As a novelist
would put it, 'his brow was furrowed.'"
"Ah! " observed his companion, "that must have been
the effect of his last examination when he was 'ploughed.'"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CAUDEBEC-EN-CAUX.
As a place of extreme quiet—not to
say sleepiness—it would be difficult to
beat Caudebec-en-Caux. It is not so
quiet as it was twenty years ago, when
the nearest railway station was seven
miles away, and at times it is really
bustling if two motor cars arrive at
once ; but on the whole it is still unlike
Paris, or London, or places of that sort.
It is not entirely cut off from the
world. There is the steamer on the
Seine, between Rouen and Havre, and
there is the little train on the branch
line which will bring you slowly from
the junction for Paris. This train goes
to and fro four times a day, as the
younger waiter of the hotel informs me
with some pride. He is a Caudebecois,
who has never been further than Rouen.
"Mais," says he, in a tone of apology
and regret, "ce n'est pas comme Yvetot.
La il y a huit ou dix trains par jour."
Yvetot is a small station on the main
line from Paris to Havre, and appears
to him to be an important junction for
European traffic, a sort of Frankfort, or
Munich, or Basle.
The rambling inn at Caudebec is
clean. As usual in French provincial
hotels, le patron does very little all
day. At tunes he drives out in
cart. At other times he chats with his
acquaintances in the caf6 on the ground
floor. But his chief work is to take off
his cap to visitors, raising it a little to
those on bicycles, and removing it
entirely to those in motor cars, being
equally polite, however, to all. La
patronne does everything else. She
welcomes the coming, and speeds the
parting, guest, directs the waiters,
answers the telephone, keeps the ac-
counts, writes out the bills, looks after
the cafe, and manages the kitchen,
where she makes omelettes which are
superb.
Except fishing, there is not much for
the people of Caudebec to do. How-
ever, like all their countrymen, they
wish for nothing better than to stancl
on the quay with a rod and line, just
as other FYenchmen do in Paris, and
Rouen, and everywhere. That they
usually catch nothing does not seem to
diminish their enjoyment at all. They
will stand under an umbrella in pouring
rain, still catching nothing. Others,
less fortunate, will stand also in pouring
rain, enviously watching them catching
nothing. One day I saw a patient
angler catch a fish six inches long. He
admitted that he had been fishing for
half-an-hour. It is only fair to state
that it had not rained—at least, not
heavily—during that time. To encour-
age him I remarked that he had the
advantage of being in the fresh air.
"Et puis," said he, "c'est amusant."

Mr. Pipsqueak (more proficient with the "long-bow" than the ihot-gun). '• YKSTKRDAY I
BROUGHT HOME SSVSS BRACS. NOT BAD, YER KNOW. FlBED ONLY FIFTttlf I'ARTRIIKIKS.
TO-DAY HAVEN'T GOT A SINGLE BIRD. NONE TO BE SEEN."
Horrid Soy. "'COURSE NOT. IT'S EARLY CLOSING DAY AND ALL THE SHOPS ARE SHUT
trp 1" [Mr. Pipsqueak wishes "horrid boys " were shut up also.
That is about the last epithet I should
have used to describe it. I should have
chosen assommant, but I did not tell
lu'm so.
As for the visitors, they make excur-
sions, and they make water-colour
sketches, and they make endless amuse-
ment during the few fine days of summer
for the quiet inhabitants. Lea Anglais
and les chauffeurs. What marvellous
people they are, strange beings who live
ever so far away, further than Yvetot, fur-
ther even than Rouen, and come to
look at the spring-tide rushing, in one
wave, up the river from the sea. The
excursions are charming, especially on
the Seine. But getting on the steamer
offers some difficulties. It does not
stop; it only drifts in mid stream, and
you are taken out in a small boat and
hauled on board by your arms, or your
collar, or your neck.
I tried this way of returning one very
windy day, from the ferry at Jumiegea.
The ferryman and his comrade, assisted
by the carter, a garde forestier and

and two dogs, burst out of.her cottage,
and jumped into the boat. She pulled
at the chain of the little anchor; it was
immovable. She pulled and pulled,
but in vain. She would not let me
help her, so I stood on the bank with
the garde forestier, the six children and
the two dogs, and gave way to despair.
The steamer was almost opposite us.
Suddenly the anchor came up, she
screamed "Erribarquez, embarquez," I
was pushed into the boat by the garde
forestier and the children, and hauled
on board the steamer just in time. The
landing at Caudebec was much worse,
for there the westerly gale and the
rapidly flowing tide from the sea pro-
duced an excellent imitation of the
Channel passage. The steamer bobbed
up and down, and the small boat along-
side bobbed up and down much more.
The boatman held on to a rope like
grim death. A fat Frenchman made
the first leap and landed safely. His
wife followed, and fell on the boatman.
Then. I stepped down. By tliis time
the narrow space in the bow was com-
pletely filled, and we were wedged up
against a cross seat, while the boatman
yelled "Passez derrlere" frantically.
Then some English Indies jumped
down upon us, and a stout old gentle-
man precipitated himself upon the
struggling mass. We clung to each
other and got ashore safely, but the
Havre and Rouen steamers on a stormy
day are not exactly the sort of convey-
ance for the aged or the infirm.

reduced to nothing?
2. What is the amount (average for

end trips to Brighton, soda-water, sun-
dries, and all the other habits you will
naturally desire to abandon in case of
your marriage?
3. Are you financially interested in

(a) Musical comedy; (b) British railways.
4. Have you any rich bachelor uncles

5. Have you any friends at Court, in
the extended sense of that phrase?
6. What is your opinion of the pro-

To visit the poor, who are all her care.
Empty-handed she conies not nigh,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mr. STANLEY WEYMAN is always welcome in the circulating
library or in one's own. His reception will be none the less
friendly because his latest effort, In King's Byways (SMITH,
ELDER), is not a substitute for the old three-volume novel, but
is a series of stories, each complete in itself. Of the most
difficult art of short-story writing Mr. WEYMAN is past
master. The scenes are laid in France in the days when
HENRY THE FOURTH was King. There is none to excel
Mr. WEYMAN in the art of reproducing the colour and the
dirt, the bustle and the loneliness, the sound and the smell
of the wicked place. My Baronite delights in the very
name of the streets. The Place de Greve, the Chatelet, the
Pont au Change, and "the Rue de Tirchasse, where it
shoots out of the Rue deBethissy." During the last hundred
years Paris has suffered many humiliations, none more petty
or more poignant than the renaming of its streets to. meet
the passion of the moment. Through these narrow paths
Parisians of the seventeenth century wend their ways, for
the most part, squabbling and fighting, frequently with
HENRY of Navarre, all unknown, playing a hand in the game.
It is true the rapid succession of pictures is of the two-
pence coloured order, dear to boyhood's heart. But in
these days of Eternal Cities, Sorrows of Sardanapalus, and
similar artificial flowers of fiction, a taste of the good old
robust style is refreshing.
Wonderful Em/land is presumably issued by Mr. GRANT
RICHARD for the Christmas delectation of children. It is,
however, a book of the sort that parents and other elders of
the household are exceedingly likely, in assumed absence of
mind, furtively to carry off for enjoyment in their private
rooms. Mrs. ERNEST AMES has written the verse as well as
illustrated it. Both are excellent. But the illustrations in
their graphic touch, their brilliant colouring, and their sly
allusiveness, are inimitable. Mrs. AMES touches a variety
of topics and illuminates all:
"Hern 's the great Houte of Comment,
Where everyone's mind
Ii aVisoi bed in some echt me
Of relief for mankind."
My Baronite, interested in the topic, looks for a picture of
the House, probably with Mr. WEIR on his legs. What he
discovers is a rapid sketch of the Terrace, in the foreground
a big red parasol only partially hiding the figure of an Hon.
Member and a lady in sea-green dress engaged in deep con-
versation.
The scene of Miss ELLEN TIIORNEYCT.OFT FOOTER'S latest
novel, Furl of Fire (HnoDER AXD STOUGHTON) is laid in the
district of an exceedingly matter-of-fact town, whose identity
is not hidden under the name of Silverhampton. The plot
is, however, cleverly invested with an attractive air of
romance. The hc.me of the hero, dating back to the Wars
of the Roses, was in good old-fashioned manner made the
subject of ill-boding prophecy. Thrice it was to be burned
down. Twice the fate had been accomplished, and the story
narrates how the third calamity was brought about. It is a
deftly devised plot, throughout commanding the attention
of the reader. But, as usual with Miss FOWLER, the
sketches of character and the conversation that sparkles on
even1 page form the distinction of the book. In quite
different ways Lady Alicia and Mrs. Candy are delightful.
The latter has qualities that, as happened in Miss FOWLER'?
first book, recall to my Baronite the touch of the vanished
hand that wrote Adam Bede. A shrewd observer of human
nature, more especially when developed in female form,
Miss FOWLER has the gift of wise and witty expression of her
impressions. Mr«. Candy probably knows nothing of the
personnel of the House of Commons. If she had closely
studied Mr. WEIR since his entrance on the scene, she could
not more accurately or more trenchantly have described him
when on his legs addressing the Speaker. Speaking of
lierself, Mrs. Candy says, "Every drawer and Cupboard in
my mind is so full of remarks that it simply won't shut, and
the more I try to empty it by making the remarks the fuller
it seems to get." THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
IDYLLS OF THE KING.
THE PASSING OF ARTHUR'S BILL.
.... So the king,
Moving as one that goes to meet his doom,
Scarce curious what the end, and slightly bored,
Drew on to that great battle of the Bill.
And by him lightly rode his uncle's son,
That had for battle-axe a crosier's crook,
And on his blazoned shield a running scroll,
"Ware HUGH!" (for so he spelled it, but the sound,
Intoned as'he intoned it, called to mind
Brer Fox, in that old REMUS tale, that cried
"Wahoo! "), and lipped his clarion, letting forth
Loud parish voluntaries, and the air
Rocked, and the High Church banners flapped their folds
As at an organ's blast; so well he blew.
But they, the heathen, lying close and low
(For so a common hate had overborne
All lesser difference of each from each)
In hollow places by the river's marge,
Otitwashed with windy riot of autumn lains,
Abode the coming of the blameless king;
Being, the most part, heathen not at all
But variously Christian, so they said;
Yet—for they chose to found a heathen league
With less of worship than the heathen use
(Such cleave at least to idols, wood or stone),
Liefer than swear by any Christian creed,
So it were not their own peculiar kind—
Before they followed ARTHUR'S way of grace,
Bristling with toll-bars, they would see themselves
Damned. So a common hat? had overborne
All lesser difference of e«ch from each.
But of the knighthood some there were that stood
Doubtfully by the king, and spake apart
Of compromise l>eneath their curving palms,
Or dealt in menace, like Sir P'LAGELLANT,
Pie that was wont to whip the laggards on.
But ARTHUR took his battle-club and cried.
Not, boastfully, but with a plaintive voice
Lacking conviction, li 0 my Table Round!
I am addressed to do this hole in one,
Or let Ex-Bulger perish in the act!"
But he, the bold Sir Biu M LE Ciminnw.Aix,
Whom some had held to lie the rightful king,
Mused in a trance, wherein the Empire showed
Larger than other creeds, and musing rode
With one spur dangling.
So the knighthood drew
Down to the river's marge; and ARTHUR said,
"I hear the FOWLER at his watery snares,
And shrill Sir FIFE that whistles with his REIDS."
Then to his own dear heart:—" Or this or that;
Either the Bill, or I myself, must pass;
But whether that or this, I cannot tell,
Nor care so very greatly, no, not I."- 0. S.

[" The inaugural meeting of the Dickens Fellow-
ehip WHS held lost night . . . The objects of the
Society, as explained by Mr. HALL CAINK, are the
promotion of good-fellowship, morality, and truth
as expounded by the master writer of the Nineteenth
Century."—Morning Pjtt, Oct. 7.]
HIGSON always was a trifle eccentric,
but it was a shock to meet him in the
Strand attired in a strangely-cut coat,
white knee-breeches, and silk stockings.
"'Morning, HIGSON," I said, attempt-
ing to pass him, "fine day!"
"A fine day indeed," lie said, grasp-
ing my arm. "A very fine day—one
of the finest days I ever remember.
You will permit me, my friend—my
dear, good, kind friend—to offer you
some refreshment ?''
It appeared to me that HIGSON must
have had some already, and I told him
so.
"Nonsense, nonsense!" lie cried.
I insist—in the sacred name of good
fellowship I insist!—MARY, my dear "—
thus he addressed the waitress in the
shop into which he had dragged me—
"I 11 trouble you for a steak, two dozen
oysters, a bottle of port, and two glasses
of brandy-and-water."
"Don't keep them," said the waitress
shortly—not altogether to my surprise,
for I perceived that the establishment
was an "A.B.C." depot.
"Bother !" said HIGSON, speaking for
a moment in his ordinary tones, " that's
the worst of these blessed rules—they 're
so hard to keep nowadays—MARY," he
resumed in his former manner, "the
solemn time has come for us to part.
Let me address you in my best blank
verse, reserved for my emotional remarks.
Virtue, my dear, virtue alone will bring
complete and satisfying happiness.
And now I '11 just chuck you imder the
chin and be off."
"Come out of this!" I gasped, as
the waitress hastily disappeared to fetch
the manager, "come out of this, you
lunatic—and tell me what fool's game
you are playing!"
"It's nothing of the sort," said
HIGSON, as we regained the street.
"I 've just joined the ' Dickens' Fel-
lowship,' and I'm 'promoting good
fellowship, morality, and truth as
expounded by' that celebrated author.
Look here, I 've drunk no brandy-and-
water for the last hour, and that's clean
against Rule 16. Or shall we have a
jorum of punch? Not even that? How
am I to live up to my principles if no
one will help me? Look, here are the
Law Courts. Shall I go in and give
comic evidence? Or would you like to
see me fight a cabman?"
"Neither, thanks," said I. "And I
fancy that you '11 find what you, term ' the
Dickens' theory of good-fellowship' a
little difficult to carry out in these days."
"Oh, no," replied HIGSON. "You
just come and stay with me for Christ-
mas! We shall till the wassail-bowl,
and heap the logs high on tlie roaring
fire, and the dear old chimes will ring
out across the snow-covered fields,
while the hours pass quickly with
snapdragon, blind-man's-buff, and for-
feits—I forget the rest, but it's very
beautiful."
"Yes," I said, mockingly, "and
you '11 gather round the fire and tell
stories and •"
"No, no," said HIGSON, quickly,
"that's wrong. They 've altered that
rule. We 're not to tell stories, but to
read aloud from one of two master-
pieces. Our President insisted on this."
"And what are the masterpieces?"
"The Christian and The Eternal
City. Do have some brandy-and-water!''
This time I consented. I felt I
needed it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.

HALL-MARKED WITH THE BRAND OF CAINE.
THE announcement of a new play at Mr. TREE'S
theatre is in itself a sure and certain "draw"
for several weeks. If, for many nights and
matinees to come, His Majesty's be crowded
to overflowing, as it was on the occasion of the
visit of Mr. Punch's Representative, it will be
no irrefragable testimony to the success of Mr.
HALL CAINE'S melodrama, but will simply witness to the
popularity of the present management and to the stimulated
curiosity of the public which has never yet been treated
to the sight of a real live modern Pope " in his habit as
he lives," on the stage of any theatre.
A long time ago, at the Lyceum, if this deponent's
memory rightly serves him, there was a piny called Sivtus
the Fifth—a name very generally and most perversely ren-
dered as Fiflns the .S'ixth. But in this instance the Cardinal,
who was the principal character in the drama, was elected
Pope only a few minutes before the full of the curtain on
the last act, so that, to all intents and purposes, as far as
the spectators were concerned, the Cardinal remained "as
he was" at the commencement of the play and of the
Conclave. That occasion was the nearest to the present
over-bold attempt, made by CAINE and-able management,
at placing a Pope on the stage, for which not a few
there be who would like to haul CAINE over the coals.
This imaginary Pope is styled P'nis the Tenth (a muddle-
headed invention, seeing that there has been a Pope PITS
THE NINTH, and that, in all probability, there will be
at some future time a Pope Pirs THK TENTH), and in
his unreal Pontificate are supposed to happen the stirring
events that actually did occur in the pontificate of Pirs
THE NINTH.
Let it be at once conceded that Mr. BRANDON THOMAS, to
whom the impersonation of this most important figure is con-
fided, plays the role with such dignity and true artistic feeling
that the influence of the character is recognised and acknow-
ledged—I may even say reverently acknowledged—by the
discriminating audience, on whose feelings it would dis-
tinctly jar were the actor to come out of the picture and
appear before the curtain in answer to the well-deserved
plaudits. Others appear in front and bow their acknow-
ledgments, but not so the artistically conscientious imper-
sonator of His Holiness. And he is right. Mr. BRANDON
THOMAS makes the part as important as it was intended to
be, though it scarcely adds to its truthfulness to represent,
an Italian speaking Latin with broad English pronuncia-
tion; but perhaps this trifle escaped the notice of the
learned author at rehearsals. As a matter of dramatic fact
a Pope, be he who he may, is absolutely unessential to the
plot. A Cardinal Secretary of State, such as was, in the
time of Pirs THE NINTH, Cardinal ANTONEU.I, would have
served the purpose far better, that is, if such a cliaracter
be wanted at all out of the novel where this eminent
ecclesiastic "with a past" might have been left without
damage to the melodrama. Excise the Papal scenes and
you have a play rather less strong than La Tosea, of
which in more than one respect Tlie Eternal City is
decidedly reminiscent.
What is the Baron Bonelli but Baron Scarpia? Does
not the scene where Homo, Volonna, standing on the right-
hand side of the stage, fingers the pistol with gradually
strengthening purpose, while her intended victim, liaron
Bonelli, is seated on the left-hand side of the stage, smoking
and talking with his back turned towards her, forcibly
recall the situation where La Tosca, standing at the supper
table (" n.ir."), with deadly intent clutches a knife, while
Scai-pia ("L.H."), with his back towards her, is writing at
an escritoire? But HALL CAINE, who, as compared with
dramatist SARDOI;, is " infirm of purpose," unites the lovers
in the last scene, and so follows the fashion of what after all
—or after HALL—is only old-fashioned Adelphi, or trans-
pontine, melodrama writ large, and here, produced in
splendid style at His Majesty's, backed up by Mr. BEERBOHM
TUBE'S well-earned reputation, is raised to a higher level as a
work of art than if it had been produced, as it might have
been years ago, at "Queen VICTORIA'S Own Theayter," then
know/i as " The.Vic," where it would have been the right
play in the right place.
Mr. TREE, as Baron Bonelli, is excellent, cela ra sans dire,
as also is Mr. ROBEUT TABER (who always suggests to us what
a HERMANN VEZIN, Junior, would be if there were "sich a
person") as Darid Hossi. On the fair shoulders of Miss
COXSTAKOE COLLIER falls the burden of the drama, and her
Donna Roma Volonna, "Sculptor, and Ward of BoneUi,"
and, so to express it, "understudy" to the invalided
invisible wife of this middle-aged sensualist, is a record in
her career, though she is severely overweighted. For is she
not pitted against SARA BEHKHARDT as La Tosca? The
surprise of the piece (to a majority, but not to Sir. P.'s
Representative) is in the Bruno Rocco of that • thoroughly
sound artist, Mr. LIONEL BROIT.H. To this character, out of
the whole list of dramatis personce, and putting aside Mr.
THOMAS'S portrait of the Pope as "hors dc concourit," is
given the finest chance in the play; and when that chance
comes, Mr. BROLTIH seizes it and turns it to the very
Ijest account. But for him this scene might have been
deleted with advantage to the play. Mr. HALL CAINE
should be deeply grateful to the clever experienced actor
who "has pulled him through." The talented Brough-
Bnino family, including his wife Elena (Miss FRANCES
DILLON), Franeesca, his mother-in-law (Miss MAY BRoron),
and Joseph, Bruno's son, Master NOEL COMPTON (a very
first-rate small performer with, it may be safely assumed,
a promising dramatic career l>efore him), form quite a little
domestic drama of their own, and the memory of their
happiness and grief, and of the tragic end of the ill-treated
Bruno, who has in him "more of the antique Roman than
the Caine," lingers with us after all is over and we have
gone to our rest-aurants.
The play is magnificently mounted, and, no doubt, the
music, specially composed by Signor MASCAGNI, is well worth
hearing apart from the play, 'lhat this eminent musician's
work must be artistically sympathetic and appropriate is
evident from the fact that it goes unnoticed by the majority,
and though there is just a little too much of unintelligible
singing to "music heard without" (it might be "choruses
without words"), the accompanying "melodrame" never
once distracts the attention of the audience from the main
action.
THE City Prepx, in defending the Corporation against the
attack of Mr. BURNS, M.P., says:—"The charge that 'its
public gluttony is as notorious as it is costly 'is ...
unfounded. Certain allowances are made to committees
for entertainment purposes; and, from time to time, the
Corporation, as the mouthpiece of London, welcomes Royalties
to the Guildhall." Mr. Punch is of opinion that 'mouth-
piece of London,' in this connection, is good.
ANOTHER CRYPTOGRAM.—The name Caliban has been thought
to 1x> cryptographic for "cannibal." That SHAKSPEARE in-
tended this to be the reading of the monster's character is
sufficiently shown by the complaint, cleverly assigned to
another persona for purposes of disguise: "Not a relation
for a breakfast."—Tempest, Act V.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEL
CANADA AS SHE IS MISUNDER-
STOOD.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,—Reverting to your
recent article under the title The
Great Misunderstood, let me say that
I am 80 glad that I did not publish
my great work on " Canada, Her History,
Customs and Resources" before visiting
England. As planned, it would have
been very unsatisfactory to people with
settled opinions, of whom I have met
several since lauding on your hospitable
and interesting shores.
As you are doubtless aware, the old
contention that " What is, is" is rapidly
giving way to the doctrine that "What
is believed to be is is." (It is just
possible that there is an "is" too many
in that sentence, but as that only
increases its metaphysical subtlety I hope
the proof-reader will let it stand.)
Having this in mind I have recast the
materials of my book along new lines
and added much that will be received
here with placid approval, and in
Canada with joyous wonder. By pub-
lishing the following prospectus you
will confer a great favour on a fellow
British subject.
"CANADA, HER HISTORY. CUSTOMS
AND RESOURCES."
CHAPTER I.—The discovery of Canada
l)y the French and its recovery by the
British—the original inheritors of the
arth.
CHAPTER II.—The invention of the
tuque and suowshoe costume, witli a
itudy of their subsequent effect on
'The Ballet of All Nations," as it is
:till presented in all the capitals of
Kurope witli the original cast.
CHAITER III.- The geographical posi-
:ion of Canada, witli map and historical
ootnote showing the value of disputed
territory when Downing Street wishes
o establish friendly relations with
Washington.
CHAPTER IV.—A digression in which
he author proves conclusively that when
he North Pole is finally discovered it
vill be found to be somewhere near the
centre of Canada.
CHAPTER V.—An appreciation of the
toast Beef of Old England and Wilt-
shire bacon as met witli on the hoof in
Jntario and the Canadian Northwest.
CHAPTER VI.—An exhaustive paper on
Canadian fruits, in which it will be
hown to the confusion of the scientific
.vorld that apples, grapes, peaches,

New York journalist, says:—
"Most of MARK TWAIN'S characters wtr« taken

old, i» tb» proprietor of a proepeiouB drinking
ealoon in San Francieco."]
AND are you nearing seventy-six?
I held you as a deathless boy.
And do you dexterously mix
The drinks that give your nation joy?
A bar! how poor a lot for you!
Yet Mr. Dooley keeps one too.
And MARK, how oft does MARK drop in
To talk old Mississippi clays,
And join you in a whiskey-skin,
And backward glancewithwistfulgaze
To those young times ere law was made,
And Injuns lurked in even1 glade?
My present drink is ginger beer,
So void our taverns of delight.
But ah! if your saloon were here,
How would I doff the Recliabite!
How would I quaff, and bless my luck,
The while vou varned of JIM and HUCK!
THE FINAL TEST.
"WELL," I said, "when is it to
be?"
PETTIFER sighed gloomily.
"Never," he replied. "Never. It's
all off. Absolutely off. We have parted,
and for ever. I loved that girl, SMITH,
with an asbestos-defying passion to
which no words of mine can hope to
do justice. We were made for each
other, SMITH. She disliked parsnips.
I loathed them. We both collected
postage-stamps. We both played ping-
pong. Our tastes, in short, were iden-
tical, and the union, you might have
thought, was of the sort that is made
in Heaven. But, no. Far from it."
"You appear broken-hearted," I said,
nt the same time offering him the only
consolation within my reach.
"Absolutely. Thanks. When. Not
too much soda. Eight. Utterly broken-
hearted."
"Then why?"
"I will tell you. Do you read
the?"
His voice sank to a reverent whisper
as he mentioned the name of one of our
great halfpenny journals.
"Regularly," I said, uncovering.
"It has a circulation five times as large
as any penny morning paper."
"It is too true," paid PETTIFEK.
"Well, I, like you, am a constant
reader of that great periodical. It is
to that fact that I owe my present
misery. A few days since I saw in its
columns an article, brief but replete
with interest, addressed to those about
to marry. 'No man,' said the writer,
'should marry without previously
examining his "fiancee with the utmost
strictness on'the subject of music.'"
"Music?"
"Precisely. The idea is that you
play selections, and mark the effects.
By these means, said the article, thou-
sands of unhappy marriages might be
prevented annually. I resolved to try
the scheme. The result is as you see.
Four days ago——"
"I know," I interrupted hurriedly;
"four days ago you were a thing of life
and joy, whereas now !Well?"
"There was a good deal more of it,"
said PETTIFER querulously; "but that is
certainly the gist of what I was about
to remark. Well, I tried her first with
an extract from SAINT-SAENS. It took
her fancy from the first bar. That was
a good beginning. Intelligence and a
well-balanced character belong to the
girl who admires SAINT-SAENP. I pro-
ceeded. She seemed pleased with a
sonata of BEETHOVEN'S, and positively
encored the Soldiers' Chorus from
Faust. I gathered, therefore, that she
was not only artistic but exceedingly
tender-hearted."
"Then why did you?"
"I am coming to that. On the fol-
lowing day I opened with a few bars of
OFFENBACH. To my dismay she was
undeniably attracted by them."
"What did that imply?"
"Cunning. Guile and cunning of
the worst description. I began to think
that the pleasure she had exhibited at
SAINT-SAENS and BEETHOVEN might—nay,
must—have been a mere veneer. I
resolved to stake my all on a final test.
Fixing her with my eye, I began to
play a little thing of my own, a teauti-
ful little piece in five flats, key of G.
Scarcely had I struck the keys, when
from the street outside came the raucous
strains of a peripatetic barrel-organ.
The effect upon LUCINPA—I should say
Miss ROBINSON — was electrical. She
sprang to her feet, ran to the window,
and began to listen with every symptom
of extreme pleasure. The ruffian in
charge played three airs, all extracts
from that idiot BROWN'S latest comic
opera."
"You don't like BROWN ?" I queried.
BROWN is PKTTIFEK'S deadliest rival in
the world of music.
He ignored the remark.
"When he had finished," he said,
"she threw him half-a-crown, closed
the window, and requested me to con-
tinue. I excused myself coldly, and
retired."
"Yes?"
"The same evening I wrote to say
that our engagement was at an end,
and that, on receipt of a fully stamped
and addiessed envelope, I would return
her letters."
THE LUCK BRINGER.
A MAGICAL stone, purporting to be a
copy of a talisman worn by the ancient
PHARAOHS, has lately been put upon the
market. For the ridiculously small sum
of half-a-crown, it will confer upon the
purchaser Success in Business, Fortune
in Speculation, Happiness in Home
Life, and various other blessings. We
append a few quite unsolicited testi-
monials :—
DEAR SIR, — Your Hokusu charm
arrived by this morning's post and has
already worked wonders. On rushing,
as usual, to the station, I trod upon a
piece of orange peel, and only fractured
my right leg and dislocated my shoulder
instead of breaking my neck. This will
enable me to enjoy a quiet six weeks in
hospital in place of my usual fatiguing
holiday. I was proposing overnight to
insure myself against accidents to-day,
but that expense will now be quite
unnecessary, as I can hardly come to
grief in this excellent institution, at any
rate for the next month or two. I can't
sufficiently thank you, but remain
Yours gratefully,
TAPLF.Y MARKS.
DEAR SIR,—I am very pleased with
the Hokusu you have sent me. It has
brought me almost within reach of
great good fortune several times during
the last few days. The very day 1
bought it I took it out with me to pay
a call on an heiress. I proposed to her
at once, relying on the talisman, and am
happy to say I was proximo aceessit, so
to speak. She only said she loved
another, and that my suit was out of
the question, as they were going shortly
to be married. But she was quite nice
about it, though firm. Again, last
Monday I backed the winner at .'50 to 1,
and should have made quite a little
pile, only the gentleman with whim I
had invested my fiver could not l:e
found. Still, I had the moral satisfac-
tion of seeing how splendidly your
charm was working. The next day,
too, I almost got a good appointment
worth £1,500 a year. I was told that
my name appeared among the selected
three out of five hundred. And yester-
day I just missed the train by a second,
when endeavouring to catch the boat
express to Southampton. If 1 hadn't
been wearing the Hokusu, I'm fure I
should have missed it by quite a
quarter of an hour, and I had a splen-
did run for my money. I could give
many other instances, but these will
show that I have good grounds for
believing in the wonderful efficacy of
your discovery. Please make any use
you like of this testimonial.
Your sincere well-wisher.

MR. PUNCH'S COUNTRY RAMBLES.
(With acknowledgments to the
"Daily Chronicle.")
A MEMORABLE afternoon may be spent
by taking the train to Muggleton, and
walking from there by way of Mudford,
Sloppingtoii,Stiokborough-in-the-Marsh,
Drencham St. Swithuns, and Swilling-
spout to Poddleton-on-the-Slosh. The
wliole district is full of memories of the
great HODGE family (before it migrated
into the towns). Quite a number of
mute, inglorious MILTONS are buried in
Poddletou churchyard, but a few people
may still be seen in the market-place
on Saturdays.
Route of Ramble. — Alighting at,
Muggleton Station (too much reliance
should not IKJ placed upon the elocution
of the local railway porter) leave the
refreshment room resolutely on the left
(as you will need to keep your intelli-
gence clear), and proceed in a nortli-
north-east-half-northerly direction along
a winding lane, until Mudford Beacon
appears in the rear. Then turn back
across six meadows and a ploughed
field, following alternately the bed of a
stream and the right bank of the canal
until Sloppington is reached. From
there follow the boundary lino between
the counties of Mudshire and Slopshirc
as far as Stickborough: from two to
seven miles further on (according to the
best local computation) lies Drencham,
where is a remarkable pump. Leaving
this landmark southwest-by-west, veer
sharply to the left twice, and pursue
a zig-zag course. If, at the twenty-
second field, you are not within easy
reach of Swillingspout it will be because
you arc incapable of following this brief
chronicle. From the last-named place
the nearest way to Poddleton is through
the railway tunnel. It is not public,
but persons have sometimes succeeded
in getting through. Poddleton is nine
miles from a station, but an omnibus
walks the distance occasionally, when
the horse is not required for funerals
or other purposes.
Length of Ramble.— Doubtful. Has
onlv been done in sections.

JOURNALISM A LA MODE.
THE dueTJbetween General PEWIN and M. FOU/INAIS, at
Ville (1'Array last week, must surely' mark an epoch in
journalistic " enterprise." Here is ail account of the combat
culled from the Evening News:—
"The men were anxious to fight out thuir quarrel with'ut ether wilnei»e>
tbim Ihe B»-cund« and ih« doctoia, BO Ihev drove out fr-'in PflHa t,o M. GA*T*H
villa in two s«i t autun bilea, which, ihey thought, lelt all the jouinalibts
bthind them."
Vain thought! They reckoned without the strategic
genius of the modern Pressman. For the report gees on :—
"There is, howtv.r, a wall wbirh ovcriooka the garden of the villa in
»hn h ihc two men fought., and m this w»U wiu pereltcd a reporter of tht
neutpiifir ' La ffi»«'.'"
Happy newspaper La Pressc! Happy journalist, securely
perched uiion a neighbouring wall to witness this heroic
conflict! It is an exquisite picture—the two elderly gentle-
men scudding away from Paris on panting automobiles, the
repeaters hot-foot after them, and erne, out-running his
fellows, or perhaps led by some diviner instinct, " perched"
on his wall and calmly noting the details of the fray. Was
ever combat between fire-eaters rendered more completely,
more adorably ludicrous?
But the precedent set by that journalistic strategist ou
his wall will not be allowed to die. He has set the pace, as
it were (like the poor General's automobile), and others must
follow. Thus, the following items of news may be expected
to figure ere long in the enterprising columns of the same
journal which secured a report of the PEECIN duel:—
•' Monsieur TEL, the celebrated scientist, died at his house
in Pussy last night. Every effort had been made to ke'ep
his approaching decease strictly private, and the house was
guarded by police. One of our reporters, however, contrived
to secrete himself under the bed, and while there was able
to note down upon his cuff the last speeches of the dying
man. The deceased, who appeared to feel his position
acutely, said . . . ."
"The marriage of M. Bi-iNC with Mile. Itot-E tcok place
at the residence of the latter's parents yesterday. The
wedding was very quiet, owing to the recent death of the
bride's uncle, and the Press were not admitted. Our Repre-
sentative, however, by pcep'ng through the keyhole, was
enabled to secure a view of at least a part of the ceremony,
and his description is as follows. The bride wore . . . ."
"The reconciliation between M. and Madame FAX FAX is
now understood to be complete. No statement has been
issued to the newspapers, but our Representative, by climb-
ing on to the roof of an outhouse which commands a view
of their sitting-room, and using an opera-glass, was able to
ascertain that the pair are now apparently upon the most
friendly terms"
"The President of the Republic dined quietly with his
family and a few friends at the Elysee last evening. It was
announced that the occasion was quite private, but a member
of our staff, disguised as a gentleman, contrived to figure
among the guests, and was able lo note down the conversation
on the back of the menu. The President said :—
The circulation of the fortunate journal which is able to
command the services of this resourceful staff should attain
colossal proportions.

THE SO-SO STORIES.
I.— How THE CAMILLE GOT HIS HUMP.
Now this is the tale of how the j
CAMILLE—the Pelletan Med iterreletan
CAMILI.E—got his big Hump, which he
still has and is likely to keep.
You must understand that the
CAMILLE—the Pelletan Mediterreletan
CAMILI.E—used to live on ink, not nice
blue-black dichroic ink like we have at
home, but nasty French ink, and he
had a 'normous Geyser pen and a 'rilie
hairless paper pad, and he used to sit
down and write 'mendous articles (which
is Magic).
And one day he got tired of ink and
thought he 'd take to water instead—
although he might have tried red ink,
which is a beautiful medium to write
in, being as red as scarlatina and much
more wholesome. But this obstinaceous
pertinaceous farinaceous (aren't they
beautiful long words, Dearly Beloved ?)
CAMILLE—the Pelletan Mediterreletan
CAMILLK, remark—said he would have
water and plenty of it, and so he set
out to walk to the Mediterranean Sea.
Now while the Pelletan Mediterreletan
CAMILLE was walking across France in
the direction of the Equator, Dearly
Beloved, they caught him and made
him a Minister of Marine (which is also
Magic), but all he said was "Humph,"
and he pursued his solitary strategic
way towards the Mediterranean Sea.
When, he got to the Mediterranean
Sea he was so 'scruciating hungry that
he insisted on having a Punch—which
is a meal some hours later than Lunch,
Best Beloved—and while he was there
he rose to his feet and exclaimed in a
voice of thunder and lightning, "Why
shouldn't the Mediterranean Sea, which
I observe basking in refulgent pros-
perity, pacification and dampness all
around me, belong entirely to the Land
of Frogs and French polishers?"
This is the way that Pelletan Medi-
terreletan CAMILLES always talk.
And everybody at the Punch said,
"Just so."
But exactly at that moment old Father
Bi'i.L stomped in.
"What were those words," he asked
in a stentorian whisper, "that smote
UJHIII my auscultant auriculars?"
This is the way that old Father BULL
always talks.
And the CAMILLE—the Pelletan Medi-
terreletan CAMILLE, you must remember,
Dearly Beloved—said it again.
"All right," said old Father BULL,
;md he thought no more about it,
but when the CAHILLF. got home he
was spanked by his uncle theHANOTAUX,
with his hard, hard hand; and he was
spanked by his older uncle, the
DEIJCASSE, with his harder, harder port-

folio; and he was spanked by his third
uncle, the LOUHET, with his hardest,
hardest ruler; and although lie said he
never said it, he went away into
"Scurity," which is a very dark place,
with the most 'mendous 'normous and
'rifle Hump you ever saw, Dearly
Beloved.
THE STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY.
f" Lord KITCHBNEB might be n great general,
but be certainly did not understand women."—
Lady Lectanr at J.eith.]
To what end, asks Mr. Punch, more
in sorrow than in anger—to what end
this brilliant career, these laurels, the
gratitude of a nation, if the hero proves
after all to be no more than an ordinary
man? In the interests of efficiency it
must not bo allowed that our general
officers should fail to understand the
fair sex! A thousand times no. A/r.
Punch has much pleasure in offering
for consideration the following paper,
to be passed by all officers superior to
the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.
1. Give a brief account of (a) EVE
and the apple, or (b) HEIJ.N and the
siege of Troy; describing as shortly as
possible the effect of either on the
world's history. Draw your own con-
clusions.
2. To whom was the name GLORIAS A
given? Mention any contemporary
ladies of military instinct to whom this
sobrigvet might be aptly applied.
3. What reasons are there for suppos-
ing that a battle-field is specially suited
for pic-nics?
4. Explain why, in the event of dis-
agreements between the wives of the
Colonel and a Captain, it is advisable
for the Captain to exchange, and state
the advantages he will gain thereby.
5. What course would you pursue
in a half-finished campaign if a lady
assured you that your conduct was a
series of errors? Would you begin it
alL again? Give your answer in
moderate language.
6. Are you in favour of adding to the
training of cadets an authorised course
of drawing-zoom instruction? 1C so,
what form should it take?
7. What military or prophetic signifi-
cance has the phrase " Monstrous Regi-
ment of Women?" If none, what does
it mean?
8. Explain the importance of tho
postscript, and estimate the relation of
a woman's words to her thoughts
(a) when she means to conceal them;
(b) when she tries to express them.
9. Give the contexts of the following
passages, with short critical notes:
"Woman is not undevelopt man,
But diverse ..."
"Woman is at once the delight and
the terror of man."
"To the Ladies, formerly our superiors,
now our equals!"

THE REMOUNT MAN.
(A War Office Portrait.)
HE wasn't a man of exceptional nous,
But he gave his whole time to the job;
He mayn't have been an Admiral Rons,
But he knew a mule from a cob;
He never did justice to himself,
For his duties overtasked him,
And he frequently missed the actual gist
Of the questions that we asked him.
He was only the very roundest peg
Stuck fast in the squarest hole,
But you mustn't conclude from that, I beg,
That he wasn't a worthy soul.
We found him fixed in a fourth-floor flat,
When the war cloud burst around him,
He was doing his best, like all the rest,
So we left him where we found him.
HOW TO GET ON.
No. I.—PRELIMINARY.
THERE seems to be no doubt about it: Britain is waking
up. This condition, of course, like almost all other striking
and important events, dates from the moment when Lord
ROSEBEHY inscribed upon his banner the magic word
Efficiency. To be sure, he did not enter into particulars.
So much condescension could not reasonably be expected
from one who is raised far above the ordinary frailties,
jealousies and ambitions of mankind, and who, moreover,
has attained that exalted position by a long course of severe
work, by an ascetic abstinence from the mere amusements,
pleasures and frivolities of men, and by a punctilious
devotion of all his energies to the public good. All that
such a man can do is to utter something resounding, some-
thing that will appeal to the man in the Tube as well as to
the man in the street, or the automobile, or on the platform,
or even in the home. Then the minor lights come along,
the Vice-Presidents of the Literal League and other orators,
and Mr. ARNOLD WHITE, and Lord CHARLES BERESFOUD, and
even Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, and (in the intervals between
expressing their supreme but affectionate contempt for one
another) they—well, you would suppose they'd fill in the
outlines, so to speak, of the great man's vast design, tell us
all definitely where we fail and why we fall short; why the
Germans are beating us in commerce, the French in railways,
the Russians in diplomacy, and the Americans in every
possible department of human activity. But, Heaven bless
you, that's just what the minor lights don't do.
First of all, as is proper enough, they tell us that we are
the most magnificent people in the world ; that we have done,
and are constantly doing, deeds that no other nation could
even attempt to imitate; that we are magnanimous beyond
belief; that it is impossible to contest either our virtues or
our universal supremacy in all those matters that make
nations truly great; that foreigners hate us because we are
too successful—but that, by the way, there is one point that
must be mentioned, one question on which we need to wake
up, and that is the groat, the paramount, question of
Efficiency. That if we do not promptly become efficient
we are lost; that other nations are efficient, and have
therefore gone ahead of us; that our War Office is both
incompetent anil a hotbed of favouritism; that our Army
can never be what it ought to be until our officers are
totally different from what they are; that our Navy is
under-manned, under-gunned and under-boilered; that our
men are sunk in sloth; that our public schools
cannot teach; that our elementary education is absurd; that
our Cabinet Ministers are mere dilettanti, and that, in short,
so miserable is our condition that, unless something im-
mediate is done, we shall plunge into an abyss of ruin from
which no amount of tardy wisdom will avail to extricate us.
And the audience, which has cheered the first part of this
speech with exaltation, applauds the final portion with a
proud but gloomy enthusiasm, and goes home to bed with
a stern resolve to make all the others efficient, or to die in
the attempt.
Next morning, JONES, who has been reading the speech,
meets BROWN in the accustomed suburban railway carriage
which daily takes them to the City :—
"I see," says BROWN, in the tone of a man announcing
the loss of a battle or the collapse of Westminster Abbey,
"I see these confounded Americans have done us out of
another contract for bridges, and the Germans, curse them,
are simply shoving us out of China."
"Of course they are," says JONES; "but what else can
you expect? We 're not efficient, and I quite agree with
Lord What's-his-name that until we are we 're bound to go
to the dogs."
"True for you," says BROWN. "We Ve got to wake up."
Thereupon JONES hastens to his office, reads a few letters,
gives a few orders, and dashes down by a mid-day train to
his favourite golf-links; while BROWN, after a heavy lunch,
snores away the afternoon in an armchair in his private
room; and both of them return home in the evening com-
plaining of the severity of their labours, and thanking
Heaven that they are not as Americans or Germans are.
However, I have said enough to show that, with all this
talk of efficiency and waking up and changing our methods
and wiping out reproaches that for some reason or other
seem to be clinging to us, we may be brought face to face
at any moment with almost revolutionary changes in all our
departments of life. It will be the object of this series of
articles to show men how, even, under these altered condi-
tions, they may still attain success in a variety of professions
and occupations—in short, how they may become efficient.
HUMANITY AND THE HOOLIGAN.
THOUGH the hobnail of the Hooligan is painting Lambeth red.
Though his belt is chipping pieces from the law-abiding
head,
Though policemen in infirmaries are racked with gastric
pain,
He is still alive and kicking,—for the law must be humane.
Now and then by district magistrates he 's " bound to keep
the peace,"
Or is given a month's hard labour—" for this sort of thing
must cease,"—
Though that only gets his muscle up to do the same again,
We have got the consolation that the law is quite humane.
So the gently nurtured Hooligan still tramples when he can
On the unprotected stomach of the unoffending man,
Or bestrews the street with fragments of constabulary brain.
For it's only to the ?Iooligan the law is so humane.
Cutting a New Acquaintance.
Major Longi'tliBoir. I met a Brahmin once with
"JOHN SMITH, London," carved on his back. You see he
was standing motionless in one of those pious trances which
nothing is allowed to interrupt. In this state he was found
by a cheap-tripper, who took him for a statue and cut his
name as usual.

TUB UNSPEAKABLE SCOT."
THE ONLY ONE WE KNOW.
( With Apologies to Mr. Croisman.)
SHALL FICTION DIE?
IK answer to the fears that have been
expressed in the North American Review
on the above question, Mr. Punch
proposes from time to time to publish
outlines of plots with a view to prevent-
ing the threatened decay of this splendid
industry.
No. I.—TIIE NOVEL OF AFFAIRS.
Hero . . . ARTHUR PONSONBY, a handsome
young engineer.
Heroine . . . LETTICE QUAYLE, a beautiful
and virtuous waitress in the employ
of the Aerated Bread Company.
First Villain . . . Mr. PIERPONT MORGAN.
Second Villain . . . Mr. SCHWAB (of the
Steel Trust).
Deux ex Machina . . . The Maelstrom.
Mr. PONSONBY, after a lover's quarrel
with the fair LETTICE, goes off in a
temper to Monte Carlo. There he
naturally loses all his money, and is
about to blow his brains out when Mr.
SCHWAB emerges from behind a conve-
nient olive-tree and bids the young man
stop. Then, as agent for Mr. MORGAN,
Mr. SCHWAB offers the young engineer
£5,000,000 for his services for one year.
PONSONBY accepts the offer and swears a
frightful oath to fulfil all Mr. MORGAN'S
orders for that period. Mr. SCHWAB
pays the hero £5 on account and then
reveals the awful plot. Mr. MORGAN lias
been refused a front seat at the Delhi
Durbar, and has resolved to ruin England
in revenge. He engages PONSONBY to
alter the course of the Gulf Stream by
erecting a huge barricade off the coast
of Florida. Thus the Gulf Stream is to
be diverted from the British Isles to Nor-
way, and Great Britain will become a
second Iceland. As our hero has pledged
his word, in spite of his agony of mind
he must carry the work through. How-
ever, he discovers an error in Mr. MOR-
GAN'S calculations. The Gulf Stream is
diverted and the Trust King pays our
hero the balance of his little account.
But the Gulf Stream is sucked in by
the Maelstrom, and emerging from it,
runs south, lapping all round the English
Coast and converting England into a
semi-tropical country. Mr. MORGAN in
despair drowns himself in the Maelstrom
with a full confession in his right boot.
ARTHUR POSSONBY is created a Peer under
the title of Baron MAELSTROM, because he
has rendered it unnecessary for the
British public to wear overcoats in
August. He marries the waitress at
Westminster Abbey, and Mr. AUSTIN
publishes an aerated ode in honour of
the occasion. Mr. SCHWAB, when last
heard of, is earning a precarious liveli-
hood by pruning the County Council
cocoa-nut palms in the Strand.
It is hoped that Mr. ARTHUR COLLINS
will certainly purchase the dramatic
rights in order to secure the " Drown-
ing Millionaire in Maelstrom " scene for
Drury Lane.
THE BURNING QUESTION.
WELL, old man. Back again! Had a
good time?
Worse luck! Oh, ripping!
Playing well?
Top of my
game. Driving
like a blooming
hurricane. Why,
there 's a hole
there—496 yards
it is—and I drove
it in two. _^_
You didn't! ~
I did, honour
bright.
Well, all I can
say is you 're , a
bigger—I mean a
longer driver than
I thought. But
—what were you
down in?
Let's see. Six,
I think it was.
Orseven. Iforget.
Shocking bad green, though, and I1,
was off my putting. But anyhow, I
know I was hole high in two.
H'm !—did you say four hundred, or
three?
Four. Four hundred and ninety-six
yards. In two.
That's practically five hundred. Any
wind?
Not a breath.
Two hundred and fifty yards a shot.
Why, that's more than I—more than
even EDWARD BLACK — by-the-by, what
ball were you using?
Ball? Oh, er, one of those rubber-
filled things. Forget which.
Ah! That proves it.
Pioves what?
Why, the Daily Mail. It's right for
once. It said the other day that those
Yankee balls don't make any difference
except to short drivers. So if it makes
all that difference to you
All what difference?
All that difference. I 'in not good at
subtraction sums when they run into
three figures. But anyhow it proves
D'you mean to imply that I 'm not a
long driver?
I don't imply. I know. I simply
say that it proves——
Look here; if you know so much
about it, why don't you go in for the
Golf Illustrated exam.? It's open to
all leading amateurs. Of course they
have asked for your opinion?
As a matter of fact, no, they haven't.
But
You don't mean to say so! I thought
from the way you talked
Well, you weren't far wrong. Mind!
I don't pretend to be one of them yet.
But if you can make one of those golf
balls bounce two hundred and fifty
yards, why, we 're all going to be
leading amateurs—as long as we can
afford 'em.

BOZL\NA.
IN a second article on "Boz and Boulogne" I regretted
that DICKEXS had not given his Pickwickian heroes a trip on
the Continent, and still more heartily regretted that a book
entitled P'ickw'ick Abroad should ever have been written by one
G. \V. M. REYXOLDS. "This book," I am informed, "is very
rare, but has some value, as solving one of the most disputed
of all known jokes. In CALVERLEY'S celebrated examination
paper on Pickirick, Question 12 is 'Anythink for air and
attrrite,' as the very old donkey observed ven they roke him
up from his death-bed to carry ten gentlemen to Greenwich
in a tar-cart.—Illustrate this by stating any remark recorded
in the 'Pickirick Papers' to have been made by a (previously)
dumb animal, with the circumstances under whicJi he made
it. This," continues my correspondent, "has quite the
Sam Weller flavour (the only one in the hook as far as I
could see which has), and I have known a dozen or more of
people searching Pickwick again in despair to find it.
CAI.VERLEY rather unfairly put it in quotation marks, but did
not give its source. It was with the greatest joy, therefore,
that I accidentally ran into it in REYXOLDS'S Pickwick
Abroad."
My correspondent adds that neither Sir WALTER BESAXT nor
Professor SKEAT, with whom BESANT was bracketed for the
"Calverley Pickwick Prize," knew anything about the source
of this quotation. The Hon. W. WARREN' VERXOX, in some inte-
resting and amusing notes on CALVERLEY'S questions, admits
that " the Donkey quotation is not to be found in Pickwick,"
and proceeds to give the three instances, therein mentioned,
of dumb animals being temporarily gifted with speech. The
5rst is what " the Polar bear said to himself men he was
practising skatinfj"; the second records what "the parrot
said," etc. ; and the third is given by .Sam to Mr. Pickwick,
>vhen, as an inducement to the latter to see Arabella the
iride. with her husband Nathaniel Winkle, he said, "If you
tnow'd who was near, Sir, I rayther think you'd change
•our note, as the hawk remarked to himself with a cheerful
augh, ven he heard the robin redbreast a-singing round the
"orner."
Mr. VERXOX writes that CALVERLEY'S question was probably
'invented" by that eccentric, humourist "as a trap." It
was no invention, but CALVERIEY slily picked out the one
good thing in Pickwick Abroad and "somewhat unfairly"
used it.
From France I have received an interesting letter
propos of what I may term the rillegiatnre of CHARLES
)ICKEXS at Condette, the little house pointed out to me as
tin, though it is not mentioned by him in his letters, and,
s far as I can judge, only indirectly alluded to. M. HURET
..AGACHE, now eighty years of age, for over forty years Maire
>f the Commune of Condette, and for eleven years President
f the Chain 1 XT of Commerce at Boulogne, writes, in a
)rivate letter, from which I have permission to make this
xtract: —
"CHABLES DICKENS, le cvlubre ucrivoin, a habitv la maisem de M.

Although I had not intended saying anything further
t present on this subject, yet, as the short papers of
eptember 17 and October 1 seem to have attracted so
nuch attention in various quarters—judging, that is, by the
mount of correspondence to which " Boz and Boulogne"
as given rise—I have felt it due to all those interested, to

•rfquently communicated to

older and simpler it concentrates everything into tabloids.
The Indian drug bhang might do as an ingredient in con-
cocting the tennis tabloid. Each player takes two (thus,
bhang-bhang), which, when swallowed, produce giddiness,
incipient apoplexy, dishevelment, facial distortion, grovel-
ling, and all the other outward phenomena of the real thing.
The players continue to take the tabloids till cured.

KITTY IN BORDERLAND.
1 DON'T know how long Kitty has been
running at the Duke of York's Theatre,
with crowds running after her to see
her Marriage, but, judging by the
laughter, the rapturous applause, and
the enthusiastic recalls at the end of
every act, whereof I was a witness a
few nights since, the nuptials of this
very clever young lady, as represented
to perfection by Miss MARIE TEMPEST,
bid J'air to be indefinitely prolonged,
although, to my astonishment, I saw,
in the hall of the theatre, an illuminated
notice of another entertainment now in
preparation by Mr. CILUILES FKOHMANN.
Why? Can there be any doubt as to the
popularity of Tltc Marriage of Kitty?
It is a really funny, "frenchy," of
course (ahem!) and very ingenious
farce, played by such a quartette of
thoroughly conscientious comedians
as, whether in London or in Paris,
where the original was produced, it
would be difficult to match in any
combination. Mr. LEONARD BOYNE
is in deadly earnest as Sir Regi-
nald Belsize, Hart.; Mr. OILHERT HARE,
cool and alert, as .John Travers, Kitty's
guardian and solicitor; Miss ELLIS JEF-
FHEYS, most amusing as the hysterical
"society" lady Mine, de Semiano, and
Miss MAIJIE TEMPEST at her best as the
light-hearted, spry Katherme Silverton.
Mr. COSMO GORDON LENNOX, adapter of
this somewhat frisky and risky French
farce, has done his work well. There
are moments in these " rapid acts " when
comes a sudden unexpected touch of
pathos which saves the merry, un-
scrupulous heroine from the charge
of heartlessness, and not only gives
pause for a moment's serious human
interest in the midst of improbable
farcicality, but redeems the action from
the category of ordinary French farces,
whose drollery lies in their irresponsi-
ble recklessness. Miss TEMPEST is the
life and soul of the piece par excellence,
but for that matter, as a friend at my
elbow put it, "Aren't they all' lifes and
s juls ' of the piece?" They are.
Honi soil qui nial y pcnse, and those
who miss seeing this lose a fair chance
of a hearty laugh.
THE COMING NATIONAL SPORT.
How fortunate for England, with her
"muddied oafs," striving ingloriously
at the effeminate game of football, that
a new exercise is forcing itself upon us
which will call forth the energetic
daring of veritable heroes of romance!
And for this exercise the sole qualifica-
tion is to be an ordinary pedestrian in
contact with a motor-car. For, granted
the presence of but one motor-car, think

of the countless adventures with which
it may provide the pedestrian in the
course of a single morning stroll. What
feats of strength and agility, what prodi-
gies of valour will he be driven to perform
or ever he reach his home in safety!
He may be chased along the road at
hurricane speed, and at any moment
find it necessary to leap aside, across a
ditch or over a hedge. The motor-car
may explode at his very feet, bursting
into flames, and discharging at him
boiling water and oil, passengers and
machinery.
With several motor-cars simultaneously
at work his experiences may be indefi-
nitely varied, and will prove invaluable
to him hereafter as a soldier on the
field of battle.
The equipment of a pedestrian should
consist of a helmet and coat of mail to
protect him against the missiles men-
tioned above; a life-belt in case of the
tardy discovery of a pond or river the
other side of a hedge; and grappling
irons for use when a tree or high wall
is the only route available.
Here, ready to" our hands, are the
materials for a manly and glorious
national sport. It rests with the men
of England to avail themselves of its
matchless advantages, or basely to
shelter behind the police regulations
and give the motorist " in charge."

MR. PUNCH'S SKETCHY INTERVIEWS.
VI.—MR. ARTHUR BALFOUB.
THE very knocker of Mr. BALFOUR'S
residence in Carlton Terrace proclaims
his aesthetic tendencies, being formed
from an old Houbraken niblick. As
the door flies open we are ushered by
several dunie-wassals, clad in the pic-
turesque Whittinghame tartan, through
a tapestried vestibule, catching a
glimpse as we go of rare prints after
MONTE CORVO, FIIOMATOR, and SAN
BORNO, and of the set of splendid silver-
mounted caddies presented to Mr.
BALFODR by the freeholders of the Bass
Rock. As we enter the library — a
spacious apartment upholstered in lapis
lazuli faience, with a portrait of Mr.
GIBSON BOWLES as Cassandra over the
fireplace—Mr. BALFOCR'S sinuous pose
as, engaged in not reading the papers,
he reclines gracefully in an American
rocking-chair, reminds us of the famous
statue of Laocoon, and an allusion to
the resemblance at once places us on a
friendly footing.
"Yes," observes Mr. BALFODR, in
reply to our unexpressed query, "my
first love was philosophy, but my
keenest interest is now centred in
psycbica, music, golf and automobility,"
and as he nodded to the window we

"Yes, my first love was philosophy."
could hear Mr. BALFOUR'S now 45 H.P.
q. f. Napier snorting in its stall. "But
the claims of politics are undoubtedly
urgent."
Discreetly evading this painful topic
we asked the Premier what authors had
influenced him most.
"Oh, undoubtedly, HORACE HUTCHIN-
SON, TOM MORRIS, and WAGNER," and here
Mr. BALFOUR softly whistled the closing
scene of the Gotterdammerung with
marvellous accuracy and verve. "I
suppose you have heard," he added,
'' of the extremely graceful compliment
paid to me by the authorities at St.
Andrews? They have actually raised my
handicap to ten in recognition of my
elevation to the Premiership. Yes,"
added Mr. BALFOUR, "golf undoubtedly
tends to promote the comity of nations.
The Grand Duke MICHAEL, as BEN
SAVERS observed the other day at North
Berwick, is a most enthusiastic player,
and I myself recently appeared in a
Russian illustrated paper, driving off

"Lord Balfour beira Lawn-Tennis-Spiel."
St. Petereburger Herald.
from the tee with the legend 'Lord
BALFOUR at the game of lawn tennis.'"
We congratulated Mr. BALFOUR on this
unique distinction. Did he find time,
we queried, to keep up his music?
'' Ah!'' sighed the eminent statesman,
"how I regret the old days in which
I used to attend the meetings of the
Handel Society, and sing thorough bass
alongside of HERBERT GLADSTONE. Music
is indeed a wondrous moral emollient.
I still play the pianola at rare intervals
—CHAMBERLAIN admires my touch vastly
—but the fact is I am obliged to devote
my scanty leisure almost entirely to
physical recreation." Here Mr. BALFOUR
lifted a gigantic bar-bell, weighing some
250 Ibs., from the floor with surprising
ease, and held it at arm's length for
several seconds before laying it down.
"Bartitsu is also a great solace. I no
longer feel the slightest dread of SWIFT
McNEiLL when I am walking home at
night from the House." A yawn from
the Premier, perceptible enough although
concealed with more attempt at thorough-
ness than in the House, warned us that
our time grew short.
"You will spend the Cliristmas recess
in Scotland? " we asked.
"Ah yes, at home. 'Turn again

Here Mr. Balfour lifted a gigantic bar-bell.
WHITTINQHAME' is what the bells ring
for me."
"And the Education Bill "we
began—when Mr. BALFODR rose to his feet
and moved the closure with characteristic
ease. There seemed to be no comment
on this situation, and we prepared to
leave. Mr. BALFODR, however, who
believes in speeding the parting guest,

accelerated our departure by placing us
on a tee in the middle of the hall mat
and driving us from the door.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO GET ON.
No. II.—THE ARMY.
BEFORE we plunge into the subject of this paper it may be
well to see if we can acquire some notion, more or less
precise, of what the Army really is. On this, as on other
points, opinions differ. For instance, my young friend,
LOFTUS CARBERRY, who has recently been gazetted to a second
lieutenancy in one of the three distinguished and brilliant
regiments of our Household Cavalry, looks upon the Army
as a repository of steel cuirasses, helmets, long swords,
jack-boots, and profuse gold and silver ornamenfs. He sees
himself in imagination mitigating the rigours of life at the
Albany or Knightsbridge Barracks or at Windsor, by a
strenuous round of dances, dinners, race-meetings, and
jaunts on the river Thames. He is, he knows, an inhabitant
of a world in which men envy him his radiance, women
sigh for his glances, and tradesmen compete for the honour
of his custom. In time, say in six or seven years, these
delights may pall, and he can then send in his papers and
live on the glory of his past and such revenues as may
remain to him—but in the meantime the life is satisfying
and easy, and of course he likes it. If you question him
about some other officer, one of the thousands who do not
belong to the Household Brigade, his answer will show that
the honest fellow takes but little interest in so humble a
creature, being very properly convinced that His Majesty's
forces depend for merit, efficiency and distinction on those
regiments that immediately guard His Majesty's body—and
after all he isn't by any means sure that the Empire couldn't
get along very well without the Foot Guards.
Take, on the other hand. Captain WILLIAM MARCHANT, of
the Loyal South Blankshire Regiment, now stationed at
Aldershot. His interest, too, is Iwund up with his regiment,
but he is hardly so exclusive. He swears by the infantry in
general and by his own little lot in particular, but he sees
cartain advantages in cavalry, and has been known to speak
with enthusiasm of sappers and gunners. Still, he is apt
to grumble—what hard-working conscientious officer would
not ?—when he sees staff appointments on active service and
other honorific positions awarded to nincompoops like
CAKBERRY, or even to Dukes, Marquises, and Earls, who may
have condescended to take up fighting as a temporary
amusement, and to grant the lustre of their coronets to the
vulgar realities of a campaign.
If you listen to General Sir HERCULES DEMISIZE (I omit the
interminable initials that follow his honoured name and
indicate his orders) certainly you '11 come to the conclusion
that though, no doubt, the Army was better in most respects
some thirty or forty years ago, there 'a not the least question
that nothing could well improve it now. Who doesn't know
old Sir HERCTLES, the wliitest-haired, the fiercest, the most
rakishly top-hatted and the most tightly frock-coated general
officer in existence? Things have gone well enough with
liim—that's certain. His medals (he served at a time when
medals and mentions were, perhaps, less common than they
are now) attest his fighting capacity. To be sure he lost
his head at the now forgotten iight of Blundernaghar, but
he kept up his reputation for strong language and personal
valour, and eventually won the battle. Now that he has
retired, no man is in greater request at public dinners, and
it was at one of these that I recently had the privilege of
listening to him as he responded on behalf of the Army.
Here is a fairly accurate report of his remarks, so far as I
could gather them between his clearings of his throat:—
"Hum—brrrm—hum! ought to be very grateful to you,
Mr. PRIME WARDEN and gentlemen, brrrm-hum, toast of the
Army which, hum, proud to respond. Many things, brrrm,
Baid about Army at present day, but, hum, venture to
affirm the soldiers of His MAJESTY not less worthy of en-
couragement than they always were, brrrm-hum. Good
deal of, hum-hem, nonsense talked about Army. Must
march with the times, of course, but, brrrm, make sure
first that we 're marching with, hum, right times and not
with wrong. Make Army larger and spend more money on
it, every cause for dissatisfaction, brrrm-hum-hem, disappear.
Have got best officers and soldiers in the world, but too few
of them. Fit to go anywhere and to do anything. Battle
of Waterloo won on playing-fields of Eton. Some compensa-
tion for hardships of soldier's life to find, hum-brrnn-hem,
work appreciated by so distinguished City Company."
There you have, in brief, the views of General Sir HJERCULES.
(To be continued.)
THE DEMORALISATION OF ROBERT.
[Lord ONSi.owhfls addressed a remonstrance to his fellow-magistrates
on the subject of the attitude of the police towards the drivers of motor-
cars in the wilds of Surrey. Among other things he contends that
"the effect upon the police of constantly acting as spies must be
demoralising.' The following verses are affectionately inscribed to
Colonel L-w-x, of the Surrey Bench.]
Bill Sykes addresses the Earl of Onslow:—
MEI.ITD, yer got 'em on the 'op!
Yer Surrey mites is much to blime,
Lettin' the self-respectin' cop

But mostly 'uman, sime as me.

And lose their hinnercence an' grice.

CUB HUNTING.
Excited Individual (galloping vp to Master). "I 'VE SEEN THE Fox! I 'VE SEEN THE Fox!'

AT THE FOOT OF THE LETTER.
[In his address to the Edinburgh Philo-
sophical Institution on October 14, Mr. ALFRED
AUSTIN advised his audience to: "Read fewer
novels, pore for a briefer time over newspapers,
dwell longer and more intimately with the
poets."]
"RHYMES area nuisance," soliloquised
ihe Poet-Laureate, as he sat at work in
bis study. "There 's only ' bed ward'
to rhyme with EDWAED, and that is no
use. 'Whenas His Gracious Majesty
King EDWARD, wearied with cares of
sovereignty, goes bedward '—rather too
prosaic, I 'in afraid. Let me see"
His study door was flung open, a
somewhat shabbily - dressed stranger
entered unannounced, and seated him-
self comfortably in the best arm-chair.
"Found you at last!" he said.
'ALFRED, old boy, you really ought to
lang out a sign, ' Epics finished while
you wait. Ode-maker by Royal appoint-
ment.1 Had no end of bother to run
you down, I assure you!"
"Really," began the Poet-Laureate,
"you have the advantage of me. Might
I enquire your name and business?"
"Name? Well, for such pals as you
and I are bound to be, 'BUBBLES' is
enough, I reckon. 'Good old BUBBLES'
—that's what they call me at the—well,
where I 'm best known. Snug little
crib this of yours, ALFRED. By the way,
any of that Royal sherry on tap? Or a
whisky-and-soda will do, if you like—
BUBBLES isn't particular, bless you."
Mr. AUSTIN rose from his chair in
some indignation. "Will you have the
goodness to explain yourself?" he said.
"What is the meaning of this un-
warrantable intrusion?"
"Unwarrantable intrusion?" cried
BUBBLES, slapping his leg and shouting
with laughter; "well, that's rich, that
is! Fairly collars the crumpet, that
does—when you asked me here your-

"You bet there isn't," replied his

"Oh, and you came to thank me for
my advice?" Mr. AUSTIN said, somewhat
mollified.
"You can put it in that way if you
like. I heard your advice, Sir, and I
resolved to act upon it. First point, to
read fewer novels. I haven't opened
one since."
"Excellent!" said Mr. AUSTIN.

period over newspapers. Ten minutes

and more intimately with the poets.
That's why I 'm here; couldn't do
better than put in a month or two with

"I am so sorry that my house happens
to be full," said the Laureate. "But
there is another poet of whom you may
have heard. His name, I be'lieve, is
KIPLING. Will you go and dwell inti-
mately with him, please? You are-—er

His maxim navra ptl propounded,
And those who held a status quo
To be maintainable, confounded,

Wherever speculation ranges—

The theme that all creation changes.
Tout lasse, tout passe: you have by rote,
No doubt, the shining lines of SHELLEY;
Or, failing them, can aptly quote
Some parallel from Miss CORELLI.
And all bewail the lot of man
Who by no method of insurance
Can foil the universal ban
That robs achievement of endurance.

This crude kaleidoscopic welter,
One institution rocklike stands,
One solid structure gives us shelter.

In one department—that of TROU-

While countless winters come and go,

To think what folks will then resemble.

Will be indeed "continuations!"
THE UNATTAINABLE.
ONE day last week, my wife, dear
MARIAN, suddenly said to me :—
"ADOLPIIUS, yesterday at the DE
SMITHS, I heard some men saying that
Cple with small incomes—under seven
id red a year—were entitled to certain
rabbits."
"Rebates, my love," I murmured,
endeavouring to read the Times.
"Well, what does it mean?"
I tried to explain, but dear MARIAN
was not exactly quick at seeing the
intricacies of the Income-Tax Act. I
told her airily that women did not
understand these things, and then she
replied rather tartly:—
"Well, do you?"
So like a woman! Did I? Why of
course I did. Every man does.
"Oh, then, you can get back our
rebate. Now you must do this,
ADOLPHUS, and I can have a new winter
dress out of the money. I insist!"
So I tried a fall with the Income-Tax
Commissioner. Before proceeding anv
farther, I may remark that it was I who
took the fall.
I sought an interview at the Com-
missioner's office, and explained that as
my total income did not exceed six
hundred per annum, I desired a rebate.
He smiled in a far-off way, and handed
me a blue-lined paper to fill up.
I bit a new quill and started in.
"You had better read the 'Instruc-
tions' first," remarked the Commis-
sioner drily.
I nodded, put down my pen, and
read:—
'' This form is not applicable to any
year prior to the year 1898—9."
Then followed:—
"Order No. .
'' A allowed for to .
"State whether you are widow or
spinster, and what is your Registered
No."
Here I broke off—" Dear Sir," I said
in tones of mild expostulation, "I have
no registered number. I am neither a
cabman nor a convict."
The Commissioner looked severe, and
silently waved me to go on, by brandish-
ing his pen.
I went on:
'' Where Repayment is not claimed
"Yes," I said, "but it is; 1 do
claim repaym"
"Proceed," he said, inexorably.
"—the form sent with the last order
of 1 repayment should be used ....
Application should be made to the
Secretary of Inland Revenue (Repay-
ments Branch), Somerset House, for
another form——"
"Another form!" I groaned, and

passed a silk handkerchief over my
aching brow. Then I nerved myselJ
to fresh effort and read on:
"In making the application the date
when the last repayment was obtained
should be stated, and the official num-
ber of the order." I paused.
"You quite follow? " asked the Com-
missioner, blandly.
"Ah — oh — perfectly. The simple
eloquence of this essay is quite touch-
ing," I replied. Then, with a mur-
mured apology to the Commissioner I
took my coat off, loosened my collar, and
once more settled to work.
"Particulars of Total Income from
every source, whether taxed or not.
For instructions see back."
I saw back.
"(1) No claim for Repayment of In-
come Tax can be allowed unless made
within three years after the end of the
year of assessment to which the claim
relates: 10th sec. 23rd Viet. cap. 14."
I could not forbear a look of gentle
reproach at the Commissioner.
"I am fond of L'ght literature," I
said, "but as to 23rd Viet. cap. 14,
well, somehow or other I don't seem
to have read this work. Will you kindly
enlighten me as to"
"Read on," came the stern reply.
I accordingly resumed.
"(2) Set forth fully in divisions Nos.
1 and 2 every source of Income. The
Income of a married woman living with
her husband is deemed to be his
Income."
Must endeavour to impress this upon
dear MARIAN when I get home.
"Where the Income is from occupa-
tion of Lands, Tenements, Heredita-
ments"
Here my head began to swim, but to
the best of my recollection the ensuing
words were:—
"—and money invested, to be treated
as separate Income, Interest, Ground
Rent, Annuity or other Annual Charge,
or whether Male or Female, or if other-
wise, state how and which, giving dates
and reasons for such answer."
Here I called a halt.
"Sir," I said respectfully, " assuming
that I answered all these conundrums
right — I merely say assuming — are
there any other requirements that must
be fulfilled before receiving my small
rebate?"
He put his finger tips together and
replied glibly:—
"You must produce all counterfoils of
the dividends you have received during
the past three years"
"All?" I gasped. "Why, I daresay
balf of them are lost!"
"Yes, all," he replied grimly. "Then
we shall require a certificate from your
solicitor that he has paid the Tax which

cheque, a certificate from your bankers
that they have paid the Tax on the
coupons they have collected, a certifi-
cate"
But I waited for no more. I stood
aefore the Commissioner, a reckless and
a desperate man.
"Sir," I said, "perhaps you will, in
addition to these modest requisitions,
Dermit me, on my own behalf, to add a
jertificate of my birth, and a short
listory of the honourable career of my
Darents; a certificate of my last re-
vaccination, a recommendation as to my
moral worth from the clergyman of my
parish, and the written testimony of
the village postmaster that I have paid
for a dog licence. Life, dear Sir, is
altogether too fleeting a thing for the
recovery of overpaid Income Tax. May
I take this paper away with me? Thank
you—it will serve to remind me of many
happy hours—or is it days ?—spent in
your pleasant, if perplexing, company."
And snatching up my coat, I fled
from the Presence.

MICKY MURPHY—MILITIAMAN.
[A propos of the heated difference which has arisen between the
KING'S uniform and theatrical etiquette, the Daily Mail reports :—" The
only time I was asked for a seat in the dress circle," said one manager,
"was by a spruce sergeant in the Life Guards. 'Certainly,' I said, 'I
have G. 14 left, and you'll be sitting next a Militiaman.' 'Not me,'
said the Lifpguardsman, and lie walked away."]
MOST people call me MICKY; MICHAEL MUEPHY is me name,
Militiaman's me callin', an' Oi 'm proud, Sorr, ov th" same.
Some thinks Oi 'm not a military koind ov lookin' man,

["The 1st (Royal) Dragoons have brought home for presentation to
the KINO a curious animal captured in the last drive of the war against
DEURET. It is called wildebeeste, and its body resembles that of a
mule with head and horns like a cow, the mane of a horse, and the
beard of a goat. When disembarked this morning it attracted much
attention."—Pall Mall Gazette.']
WE shall expect next to read:—"A curious animal has
recently been captured in India and sent to England as a
present by an Indian Potentate. It has a ponderous, un-
wieldy appearance, with heavy rotund legs and massive skin,
but its most curious feature is a long active proboscis, which
it can use to pick up objects from the ground. It is called
"elephant," and on being landed it was followed by a
number of small boys and others.
OF THE VERY BEST QUALITY.
J. M. BARBIE'S Quality Street is a delightful specimen of
domestic comedy in four acts, playing from half-past eight
till five minutes past eleven. If the long speeches, which
are neither in keeping with the character of the play, nor
with that of the winsome heroine who has to deliver them,
were considerably abbreviated or simply omitted, there
would be no doubt whatever about the quality of the re-
mainder after subtraction of the quantity. To quote
the words of the old operatic ballad, "As I view
these scenes so charming," and behold a crowded house
deeply interested in every actor and in every word (except-
ing the long speeches aforesaid) of this simple, wholesome
story of a quiet life in (as I suppose) a garrison town in
Somewhereshire, thus dramatically told and artistically
acted, it occurs to me to question the need of " problem plays ''
and sensation, and to answer my own enquiry, made " but
for the satisfaction of my thought," with the reflection that
the Theatre, as an amusement, is bound to cater for all
tastes, and that "CHARLOTTE" going on "cutting bread
and butter" would soon become a very monotonous person-
age.
As Valentine Broicn, the brisk young gentleman who is
something of a country squire, something of a poet, some-
thing of a business man, something of a doctor, a little of a
private soldier in a—presumably—Hussar regiment, who
loses an arm, which-—again presumably—he has left at
Waterloo, ultimately becoming a highly decorative warrior
who has won his commission by his gallantry in the field,
and wins his fair bride by the lack of it at home, Mr.
SEYMOUR HICKS is to the manner born, his quiet pathos being
well contrasted with his buoyant high spirits. As the conceited
young officer Ensign Blades, in a hideous uniform, Mr.
VANE-TEMPEST distinguishes himself by his assumption of
fatuity, and might have stepped out of one of DICKY DOYLE'S
illustrations to THACKERAY'S Vanity Fair or The Newcomes.
Mr. STANLEY BRETT as Lieutenant Spicer has little to do
except to resemble as closely as possible, allowing for dif-
ference of uniform, Mr. SEYMOUR HICKS as Captain Valentine
Brown; and so well does he contrive this that more than
one among the audience thought that there was a surprise
in store, and that, somehow, Brown and Spicer were
to be mistaken for one another and would come to l>e
muddled up with Miss Phoebe Throssell and Miss Susan
Tliroasell, who exist only in the person of Miss Phoebe as
representing two single ladies rolled into one.
Mr. BARRIE is unpardonable for letting us see Mr. SHELTOK
the Recruiting Sergeant (nameless) only once for a few brief
minutes in the First Act. Is he the sweetheart of buxom
Patty of the First Act, merrily played by Miss ROSFNA
FILIPPI, or is he not? What is he? Why does the gallant
but nameless Sergeant disappear? Has he been killed in
battle, and being nameless in the bill, have the authorities
been unable to include him in the official list of killed or
wounded? If so, Patty of the Third Act should be sad.
Has he deserted the Army and his Patty? Patty of the
Third Act should be indignant.
At the end of the piece curiosity concerning the fate of this
recruiting Sergeant remains ungratified. Up to the latest
moment not a few who know the ways of dramatic authors, and
who may remember the '' surprise packet'' in the last scene of a
military play at the Haymarket, will expect to see the name-
less Sergeant, having made a name for himself, return, in
full uniform, his manly breast covered with medals, with no
arms and only one leg, wheeled on in a triumphal bath-chair
by Patty of the Last Act, henceforth wife of Field Marshal
th<3 Duke of BRANDYANDWATERLOO. This neglect of an old
soldier is sad: better to have brought him in and to have
cut out the superfluous speeches. But then it cannot be—

and the Nameless Sergeant remains the hero of a Twenty
Line Regiment. The little school boys, with Master GEORGE
HERSEE at their head, are capital, as are also the little school
girls, and the whole pupil-teaching scene, with the dance
and spinet, is delicious.
Miss MARION TERRY'S simple Sttsan Throssell is a delight-
fully perfect piece of comedy. A character that might
have been so uninteresting—for in itself it only interests
at all through its sweet sympathy—here stands out sharing
the honours with the heroine. And, as the heroine, can
you find me a sweeter, more pathetic, merrier, sadder,
more altogether charming Phcebe Throssell than Miss
ELLA LINE TERRISS? No; not possible. There '11 never be
another to play this part, double, double toil and trouble
as necessity may (and I hope it won't) require. But why,
0 why does this charming actress allow herself to be over-
burdened by these BARRiE-tone lengthy speeches, which
may be all very well for him to write into a novel, but for
which there should be "No admittance, not even with
'business,'" in this play? There are certain "lengths"
to which, even for the sake of author BARRIE, Miss ELLALINE
should not go, and "these be of them." To all the other
ladies concerned in this there is nothing but praise to be
given, as also to Mr. Stage-Manager FRANCCEUR.
A FACER.—When last Thursday evening Mr. O'DONNELL
so pugnaciously confronted Mr. ARTHUR BALFOUR, the Question
was whether "the Eyes" or "the Nose" were likely to
have it." Fortunately, neither.
LITERARY "INTELLIGENCE."
IT is rumoured that the December Number of the

The statement published by a contemporary that the first
sentence of Mr. HENRY JAMES'S forthcoming novel is to be
serialised in America, and will run for a year in the pages
of a popular magazine there, is not wholly correct. The
sentence, being somewhat shorter than usual, will appear in
six monthly instalments only.
We hear that Messrs. S. R. CROCKETT and IAN MACLAEEN
have recently completed new novels, and that English trans-
lations will be published simultaneously.

JAPANEASY SLUMBER.
DEAR MR. PCXCH,—I see in a column of "Science Notes"
a statement that the Japanese have a method of inducing
sleep which has a great reputation in their country. It
consists in the application of pressure to the carotid arteries,
so as to stop the flow of blood to the brain. I have no
doubt that you, as the universal physician, will be familiar
with this remedy, but you may have thought it too drastic
for habitual employment. If not, may I supply you with
one or two similarly infallible cures for other ills to which
flesh is heir?
Afumps.—In this distressing complaint there is a marked
swelling of the glands of the throat. It can be cured in
the following manner. Make a loop in a long cord and
place it round the patient's neck in the vicinity of the parts
affected. Then pass the free end of the cord over the
branch of a tree and pull. No mumps can resist this
treatment.
Headache. — The apparatus for curing this is almost
equally simple, and no family should be without it. It
consists merely of a wooden block, and an axe of convenient
size. The patient assumes a prone position, with his head
upon the block, and the axe is applied to the back of the
neck below the seat of pain—which it removes.
Chilblains.-—The remedy for these inflictions is of a
homoeopathic nature. The toe, or other affected part, is
plunged into a freezing mixture until sufficiently frostbitten.
If the operation is performed with skill the toe will ulti-
mately drop off, and the chilblain will come with it.
Consumption.—This grave disease demands more stringent
treatment. The lungs being rendered partially useless, the
remedy consists in a return to the gill-breathing habits of
our early aquatic ancestors. The patient should be com-
pletely immersed in water, and kept there until gills make
their appearance through the change of habitat, when he
will be found to need no further medical attendance.
The Japanese are a progressive race, but I think it my
duty to show that in medical science the European is still in
advance of them.—Yours obediently, KILBV KEWRIXQ, M.D.
ADVICE GRATIS.
[A correspondent of the Daily Xeirs suggests that, to prevent desul-
tory reading, each library should have a literary adviser, to indicate
the line of reading visitors shoidd prefer.]
CAHNEOIE, while our grateful thousands crowd
The libraries your lavish purse endowed,
There lacks one boon to make the gift complete—
A monitor to guide our aimless feet.
Our faulty taste he carefully should note,
And give at once the wholesome antidote.
With AIiix's stern logic such a one might foil
The cult of BOOTHBY or of CON AN DOYLE;
CAINE and CORELLI should alike be banned,
And TUPPER once more flourish in the land.
And should a sentimental housemaid crave
Novels whose baneful pages would deprave,
Leaving such culpable requests ignored,
He would supply—say, Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD.
Or if an urchin, meriting the rod,
Applied for Snarleyow or Sweeney Tod,
This tactful guide would counteract his wiles
With blameless LUBBOCK, or with SAMUEL SMILES.
So shall we foster in the youthful mind
A love of reading of the noblest kind;
And only to our libraries admit
A chastened public—few, perhaps, but fit.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DUET OF TOBY, M.P,
House of Commons, Thursday Night.
—Lord GEORGE HAMILTON, Secretary of
State for India, Captain of Deal Castle,
this afternoon strolled across Palace
Yard all unknowing what fate had in
store for him. He was thinking of the
coming Durbar, and agreeing with him-
self that since he could not be at Delhi
his King and country would be mode-
rately well represented by his young
friend, GEORGE, Lord CURZON. It is the
opening day of the Autumn Session,
specially summoned to deal with the
Education Bill. India will not have a
look in, except for the Budget. That
afar off. To-day not a cloud of official
care skirts the sunlit heights of GEORGIE'B
happiness.
Four hours later he was sitting on the
Treasury Bench in imminent peril,
"not knowing," as Mr. FLAVIN said,
"what hour might be his next."
The incident arose, as similar ones do
in House of Commons, without a note
of warning. Irish Members in care-
fully planned state of unrest. REDMOND
ai-ne and JOHN DILLON are on the seas,
bound for United States with intent to
hand the hat round. Nothing so help-
ful to them as a flare-up in Commons.
As at country fair the opening of the
show is heralded, and pennies gathered
in, by beat of big drum, so a row on
floor of House would give bold adver-
tisement to the eleemosynary mission.
Trial made by several hands in varied
ways. SWIFT MACNEILL, the accustomed
hot potato in his mouth, wrangled with
the SPEAKER. WILLIAM O'BRIEN, fully
dressed, attacked the Chief Secretary.
REDMOND cadet blustered in his noisiest
manner. These were old Parliamentary
hands. O'DoNNELL, a young colt, beat
all, including BANAGHER.
After four-hours-and-a-half sufferance
of a performance grown tiresome by
iteration, PRINCE ARTHUR moved the clo-
sure. SPEAKER rose to submit question.
Irish. Members insisted O'DONNELL should
be heard. To that end, when he, in
defiance of the SPEAKER, proceeded to
deliver his speech, they drowned his
voice in turbulent roar. O'DoNNELL
went on shouting, wildly waving his
arms. Suddenly, at a bound, he leaped
across Gangway and took up position
behind Front Bench, frightening the
life out of Dr. FARQUHAKSON, thinking at
the moment of the mountain he owns in
Scotland, forsaken that he might attend
Autumn Session and discuss Education
Bill. O'DONNELL'S movement obligingly
made so that, being at closer quarters,
PRINCE ARTHUR might profit by his
observations. His compatriots below
Jie Gangway, more than ever insistent
that he should be heard, roared the

RATHER A LARGE ORDER.
"Give me Rhussia, Misther Speaker, dive
me Rhussia ! —"
'(Mr. D-l-ny.)
louder. PRINCE ARTHUR was standing at
Table, his lips moving in inaudible
speech. Also the SPEAKER on his legs
at the Chair; O'DoNNELL meanwhile
dancing the hornpipe of Donnybrook in
dangerous proximity to FARQUHARSON,
who more than ever regretted he had
left his mountain home.
Though no whisper of what PREMIER
was saying floated above the storm,

"As a native of Uganda, Sir"
(Mr. Tim H-ly.)
everyone knew he was moving suspen-
sion of the Dancing Dervish opposite.
At sight of him O'DONNELL'S fury
exceeded bounds. Dashing to the left,
clear of the benches and of hands put
forth to hold him, he leaped down
Gangway and sped across floor, making
straight for Treasury Bench. Was ho
going to seize the Mace and, swinging
it shoulder high, make a clean sweep of
right honourable occupants?
Here became apparent GEORGE HAMIL-
TON'S dilemma. Passing up to the
Clerk's chair to hand in his Resolution,
PRINCE ARTHUR, instead of returning to
his old place, dropped into seat at
lower end of bench. This accidentally,
in some sense appropriately, left the
Captain of Deal Castle on the ramparts,
represented by the upper and otherwise
unoccupied end of the Treasury Bench.
Between him and PRINCE ARTHUR sat
three other Ministers. O'DONNELL,
making his way between the Table and
the Treasury Bench to a position in
which he could conveniently shake his
fist in the face of the PREMIER, halted
just opposite the SECRETARY OF STATE FCR
INDIA.
Wilder grew ecstasy in the Irish
camp. Louder their roar of insistence
that O'DONNELL should be heard. As
for that lion. Member, he, waving his
arm like a windmill that has taken an
overdose of bhang, shrieked what was
presumably denunciation of PRINCE
ARTHUR and all his works.
Nothing more remarkable than the
composure of His Majesty's Ministers in
these extra-Parliamentary circumstances.
Here was a wild Irisliman suddenly
projected in their midst, his clenched
fists almost brushing the tips of their
noses. Possibly there was a gleam in
their eye, a stiffening of their right
arm, showing they were ready for final
emergency. For the rest, they sat
impassive, regarding the whole proce-
dure as a usual sort of thing, such, for
example, as bringing in a Bill. PRINCE
ARTHUR, at whose countenance the
clenched fists were more especially
directed, with sublime courtesy leaned
forward in attitude of closer attention
to the hon. gentleman's remarks, an
effort made necessary by the iiproar of
his compatriots, anxious that he should
be heard.
This all very well for right hon.
gentlemen a little lower down; for the
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA, with
O'DONNELL'S knees actually pressing
against him, his breath flaming in his
face, contiguity was a trifle close. But
the courage of the HAMILTONS was not
lacking. It is true there was an almost
imperceptible indrawing of the knees, a
slight movement aside with polite inten-
tion to give the visitant more room for
oratorical effort. Otherwise LORD GEORGE

did not flinch, though like FARQUHARSON,
now breathing more freely on the other
side, he thought fondly of his deserted
home of Deal Castle with its moat, its
long bridge, and its immunity from
Irish Members.
Business done.—Mr. O'DoNNELL goes
on the rampage and is suspended.

Leader of Opposition, storm-tossed after
Channel passage, but filled with large

the war) is over and gone. The flowers
of unbroken brotherhood appear on the
earth. The time of the singing of birds
(the Autumn Session) is come: and the

Here C.-B. turned to the SQCIEE OF
MALWOOD seated on his right hand,
gazed with benevolent solicitude on his
peaceful countenance, and thought ten-
derly of his last week's speech at Ebbw
Vale. All the same he looked wistfully
at HICKS-BEACH'S empty place on the
Treasury Bench, and mused on the
happiness of being able to regard
Parliamentary strife from an irrespon-
sible back seat.

seals of office at the hands of his
sovereign, the other, supremer satisfac-
tion, when he returns them? By the
way, TOBY, dear boy," he continued, "I
have been enjoying myself in the Recess
by reading something else than Blue
Books. For one thing read In Memoriam
over again. Been struck by illustration
of the saying that a poet is also a
prophet. You remember the verse :—
Who ploughs with pain his native lea
And reaps the labour of hp hands,
Or in the furrow musing stands;
'Does my old friend remember me?'
Written nearly forty years ago, you see
its direct bearing upon the politics of
to-day. The first line is plainly a refer-
ence to ASQUITH'S phrase about plough-
ing the sands. Lee shore was evidently
in TENNYSON'S mind. Exigencies of
metre compelled him to leave out
'shore,' and the printer spelt lee with
an a. The reference conveyed by
the man ploughing his own furrow
and musing on former friendships is
too obvious. There leaps to the eye a
picture of ROSEBERY resting by his one-
horse plough wondering what the SQUIRE
OF MALWOOD is thinking of at the
moment."

LAST week we started out in glee,
The boys and BERTHA, Aunt and me,
Across the village green to see
The Comet;
Some people really must be blind,
Or only give it half their mind,
It isn't difficult to find—
Far from it.
JACK found one in " The Lady's Chair,"
And BERTHA, with her nose in air,
Descried a couple in " The Bear "—
I backed her.
While Auntie, dazzled by the view,
Stepped in the ditch before she knew,
It took us twenty minutes to
Extract her.
With stars and comets on the brain,
Two figures vanished up the lane,
A better view—of course—to gain,
But whether
It was that Auntie missed her sleep
Or found the lane a trifle steep,
She sulked, because we would not keep
Together.
We found the others looking black,
But though they made a joint attack
Their darts we managed—back to back—
To parry;
TJiey voted finding comets slow,
I found the time too short, I know,
Too short, and much too sweet, and so
Did HARRY.

[OCTOBER 22, 1902.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MY Nautical Retainer writes:—"If the work of JOHN
OLIVER HOBBES offered no better entertainment, it would
always be at least an admirable touchstone of criticism. It
lias become the fashion to take its qualities, good or
bad, for granted; actual appreciation of them, with a view
to the readjustment of verdicts, is quite rare. Mrs. CRAIGIE
has suffered more than most authors from the trick of the
aolenne epitheton. It matters nothing to some of our judges
that her latest book, Love and the Soul Hunters (FISHER
UN WIN) shows a notable advance in humanity; they will still
describe it as solely distinguished by a 'hard, glittering
brilliancy.' Because she abjures all ' pathetic fallacies,' and
refuses to fling the hearts of her people in your face, there-
fore she must be found to have no feeling. This is the
kind of credit that a writer wins for the possession of that
most rare gift, a genius for irony—in its right Greek sense
of understatement.
With the vivacious wit of her earlier volumes Mrs. CRAIGIE
has now combined some of the emotional
seriousness of The School for Saints and
Robert Orange, but freed from the half-
suspicion of artificiality which qualified
the charm of those later volumes. Her
new characters are artificial only in the
way of romantic selection. However
capricious in the choice of her types,
she here realises the thing imagined.
Prince Paul, Felshammer, Rachel, La
Belle Valentine—not one of these is a
character familiar to experience; yet in
each case the author justifies herself
of her creatures; she makes them always
alive and believable. Felshammer is a
surprising revelation. You think at
first that this is to be a second Melchior
out of BROWNING'S Colombe's Birthday,
or else, less subtly conceived, the usual
loyal henchman of Mr. SETON MERRIMAN'S
The Sowers. He is nothing of the kind:
he is of spontaneous birth, excused from
all extraction; the most 'impossible ' of
men, yet always appealingly probable.
If a fault can be found in the book, it
lies in a certain lack of regard for
proportion in the analysis of subordinate characters. The
past career, for instance, of the rather unessential Lucie
is detailed with needless prolixity. One might indeed be
tempted to say that, while Mrs. CRAIGIE is over-busied in
giving its own atmosphere to each of her figures, the larger
atmosphere, along with that sense ^of values by which
distances and degrees are established, seems at times to have
eluded her. This suggestion of a somewhat dispersed
energy may, of course, be consonant with the intention that
underlies the title. The Soul Hunters are many: the chase
is over a wide country; no single dominant figure absorbs
attention; and the only Hunter that rides straight is out of
the finish. Personally I think that the title is the least
happy feature of the novel; for if Love is here contrasted
with the worldly Hunting of Souls, it is curious that the
most unscrupulously professional of all the Hunters wins
the love of the best Soul in the book. But this is an
inconsiderable blemish, if blemish at all, in a work of
astonishing resource and most engaging charm."
Miss BESSIE HATTON has the gift of actually seeing fairies
—of course not in the flesh, but in the^gossamer. In
Pilgrims of Love (TREHERNE) she makes them known to us
grosser,.mortals, who find the acquaintance charming. Of
the eight Pilgrimages, my Baronite, essentially earthy,
chiefly delights in- Sibyl's, and Lemuel's in search of the
sea, which, alack! ended in his being frozen to death on a
starlit night on Hampstead Heath. The neglected starveling
had been reading the poems of DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI, a
pleasure Miss BESSIE HATTON has evidently shared. He finds
in the preface tliat the poet is dead and buried at Birching-
ton-on-Sea. Lemuel resolves to go and find the grave and
lay on it a garland for memory and love. The journey of
the little waif through the crowded wintry streets, his
spending of his last sixpence on a couple of sprays of lilies
of the valley, and his finding rest under the stars, is told
with touching pathos. Sibyl's pilgrimage, which also has
human interest in it, is narrated with equal daintiness of
touch and poetry of feeling.

It is some time since the Baron read a work of Mr. B. L.
FARJEON'S, and therefore The Mystery of the Royal Mail
(HUTCHINSON & Co.) is as a stranger specially welcome. The
Baron may be permitted to advise the sensation-loving
reader to curb his impatience concern-
ing the appearance on the scene of the
Royal Mail itself, as it arrives very late;
but better late than never; and the
interest that is excited in the first
chapter is well sustained up to the very
end.
Interesting and amusing to all, but to
theatre-goers especially, will be found
Mr. JOSEPH HATTON's first number of a
series entitled Cigarette Papers (ANTHONY
THEIIERNE & Co.). In this our Facetious
JOSEPHUS pleasantly sketches Sir HENRY
Invrao's career from earliest childhood
up to the present time. Tis not so
much the cigarette papers that are of
value, but the good tobacco that is
rolled up inside them, of the best Hatton
brand. "Cigarette papers," when filled,
must end in smoke, that 'a the pity of
the title; and they absolutely require
puffing in order that the consumer may
enjoy them as the Baron is likely to do.
Too late to change their name now.
This paper is well illustrated by W.
H. MARGETSON. Perhaps as both Sir HENRY and 'JOHNNIE'
TOOLE are so fond of the salubrious Kent Coast resorts, any
future number that deals with either of these celebrities may
possibly be illustrated not only by MARGETSON but by
WHINE IN THE WOOD."

MR. PUNCH'S COMPRESSED DRAMAS.
I.—CHANCE AND THE IDLE.
(.4. study of the manners of the higher classes as revealed
in MR. JONES'S latest comedy "Chance, the Idol," at
Wyndham's.)
ACT I. SCENE—Lady MARY NOBODY'S pi-irate sitting room
in the Casino Palace Hotel, Monte Carlo. Lady M. in
reclining in an easy chair, yawning with the elaborate
boredom invariably displayed by the aristocracy on the
modern stage. To her enter excitedly Mr. ALAN LEVER-
SAGE, her nephew, a youth of five-and-twenty.
Alan (in tragic accents). Lost again!
Lady M. My dear ALAN, what is the matter?
Alan (crossly). Nothing. Nothing. Only I 've lost my
last sixpence.
Lady M. (languidly). Poor fellow! We really ought to
have taken you away from Monte Carlo last week. Only
there was the SNOOKSONS' dinner party to-morrow. We
couldn't miss that!
Alan. Well, what's to be done?
Lady M. (yawning). I don't know. You must marry
Miss KENNETT, I suppose. It's a nuisance for you, of course,
but DOUCE KENNETT 's a nice girl. (Explanatorily) DOUCE is
French for sweet, you know. And she 's very well off.
Alan (gloomily). Suppose she refused me?
Lady M. Of course she won't refuse you. What on earth
would become of young men in good society if young
ladies with money refused to support them? The situation
would be intolerable.
Alan. I dare say you 're right. But it's rather awkward.
The fact is I 've already promised to marry someone else.
Lady M. (calmly). Has she any fortune?
Alan. That's the worst of it. She hasn't.
Lady M. Then I don't think we need consider her further.
You must propose to DOUCE KENNETT at once.
Alan. Very well, Aunt MARY. But it's hard luck on me.
I like the other girl much better. (Servant brings in card
on salver.) Good Heavens!
Lady M. (languidly). Who is it?
Alan. The other girl. ELLEN FARNDON.
Lad;/ M. (shocked). How very indecorous of her! Young
women without fortunes really ought to stay at home and not
turn up at expensive Riviera hotels in this way. (To Servant)
Show her up.
[Exit Man, returning at once with ELLEN FARNDON, a young
person with an "intense" expression, a vibrating
voice which in moments of emotion appears to come
through her nose, and a dark dress of unattractive
material.
Ellen (advancing impulsively towards him). Oh, ALAN!
Stops short, seeing Lady MARY regarding her fixedly through
a lorgnette).
Alan (taking hand gingerly). Er — how do you do?
Hiss FARNDON—Lady MARY NOBODY.
Lady M. (icily). My nephew has just told me of this
regrettable entanglement, Miss FARNDON. I think it right to
nform you that he has given up all intention of marrying
you.
Ellen. But he gave me his word.
Lady M. (haughtily). You may be sure my nephew would
not break his word—unless there were something substantial
o gain by it. But as you have nothing for him to live
upon
Ellen (eagerly). But I have, I have. I have just had some
money left me. I came to him at once.

Ellen. Oh, a great deal—nearly two thousand pounds!
Lady M. (severely). My dear young lady, I am afraid you
have a very imperfect acquaintance with, the value of money.
No one coiild hope to support my nephew on the interest of
two thousand pounds. The idea is preposterous.
Alan (generously). Oh, come, Aunt MARY, two thousand
isn't so bad. We couldn't do much with the income of
course, but we might get along for a bit on the capital.
Lady M. I could not sanction such an arrangement. As
your aunt I regard a capital of ten thousand poiinds as
essential to your happiness. Twenty would be better. But
I might give my consent to ten. Two thousand I consider
quite derisory. My nephew owes nearly that already.
Ellen (meekly). It seemed a lot of money. And it would
pay his debts.
Lady M. That is true. And I cannot imagine a more suit-
able vtse for you to make of your legacy than to pay my
nephew's debts with it. But as that course would leave you
no means of supporting him afterwards, it could hardly be
considered as a preliminary to marriage. Good evening.
[Exit ELLEN dejectedly.
ACT II.—SCENE the same. TIME—the following afternoon.
Lady M. and ALAN discovered lounging over novels.
Lady M. (smothering a yawn). Have you spoken to Miss
KENVETT yet?
Alan. Not yet.
Lady M. My dear ALAN, why not?
Alan. Well ... I did mean to this morning, but somehow
felt a delicacy about it.
Lady M. (indulgently). Foolish boy, this shilly-shallying
is unworthy of you. When anyone in our class pays a
young lady the compliment of marrying her for her money,
lie owes it to her to make the proposition with suitable
alacrity.

about it later. [Returns to Ms novd.
Enter ELLEN FARNDON. She looks flushed
and triumphant.
Lady M. Miss FARNDON! This is
unseemly. This pursuit of my nephew
almost amounts to persecution.
Ellen (more vibrant than ever). I didn't
mean to persecute him. But I find I
have more money than I thought last
night—considerably more. So I came
to tell him.
Lady M. (mollified}. Ah, that 's
different. But I trust the increase is
something appreciable?
Ellen. I have now eight thousand
pounds.
Alan (impulsively). My darling!
Lady M. ReaUy, ALAN! (To ELLEN.)
That certainly sounds more promising.
How was the increase arrived at?
Ellen (blushing). I have been gam-
bling.
Lady M. Naughty child! But how
clever of you! To have won six thou-
sand pounds since breakfast is really most
praiseworthy. (Languidly) Really it is
extraordinary what a faculty for money-
making the lower classes have! There
must be something in blood after all!
Ellen (eagerly). And I may marry
ALAN now?
Lady M. (cautiously). Not now. After
tea, perhaps—if you can make another
two thousand by then. Ten thousand
was the figure I named, I think?
Etten. Won't eight thousand do?
Lady M. (firmly). Ten thousand. Not
a penny less. We have marked him
down very low as it is. (Relenting)
You might become engaged on eight
thousand if you like.

might do that.
Ellen (ecstatically). How good you
are! {Embraces him.
Alan (complacently). I always try to
do the square thing.
Lady M. There, there, that will do,
child. Go back to the rooms now. You
may return for tea. [Exit ELLEN.
Alan (in a burst of generous emotion).
I 'm so glad it's to be ELLEN, not Miss
KENNETT. I really am quite fond of her.
Lady M. I dare say it's all for the
best. But DOUCE KENNETT is the better
match. She has a hundred thousand
pounds at least.
Alan (sighing). It seems an awful lot
of money to give up!
Lady M. And I suppose Miss FARN-
DON'S relations are impossible? But of
course you needn't know them.
Alan (firmly). I shan't. (Bothbecome
absorbed in their novels again. Presently
re-enter ELLEN, haggard and desperate.
She sinks into a cliair.) ELLEN! What
has happened?
Ellen (in her most vibrant tones). I
vave lost—lost everything!

Lady M. Really, Miss FARNDON, this
is inexcusable. Just after becoming
engaged to my nephew, too!
Alan (peevishly). How did you man-
age it?
Ellen (hopelessly). I don't know. I
backed red and it turned up black, I
suppose. Or I backed black and it
turned up red.
Alan (sympathetically). That's what
always happens to me.
Lady M. (sternly). And have you
nothing left?
Ellen (tragically). Nothing!
Lady M. Wicked girl! This comes
of your deplorable indulgence in gam-
bling.
Ellen (feebly). But you didn't mind
my gambling so long as I won.
Lady M. Of course not. Roulette,
when you always win, is perfectly respect-
able. It becomes practically a branch
of commerce. But to lose money by
gambling is vicious.
Ellen (meekly). I didn't mean to lose.
LadyM. Very possibly. But I cannot
accept good intentions as a satisfactory
substitute for settlements. Of course
your engagement to my nephew must
now be considered at an end.
Ellen (beseechingly). ALAN! You
don't think that?
Alan (lamely). Well ... er ... I
don't see what else we can do. Of
course I want to do the square thing.
But a fellow must have sometliing to
live upon.
Ellen (diffidently). Couldn't you get
some work?
Lady M. (with disgust). Work! my
dear girl! (Impressively) WE NEVER
WORK!
Alan (more kindly). My aunt means
that people in our position in society
are not expected to earn their living.
It isn't done.
Ellen. But I didn't know you had
any particular position. LEVEBSAGE isn't
an aristocratic name.
Alan (shocked). But the NOBODYS!
Everyone has heard of the Slopsliire
NOBODYS! And Lady MARY is my aunt.
Ellen. But I don't want to marry
your aunt.
Alan. No, no, my dear ELLEN, it's
quite impossible. I belong to the Idle
Classes. For me work is out of the
question. You must go back to your
father and I must marry someone else.

contribution of three millions still heads
the list.
It is announced that the Royal Yacht
is to be fitted with telescopic masts.
Will the work be undertaken by the
same firm that makes our patent
collapsible torpedo-boat destroyers?
In view of the decision that Tlie
Eternal City, at His Majesty's, is to be
followed by a play of SHAKSPEARE'S, "An
Admirer of HALL CAINE" (said to be
Mr. HALL CAIKE himself) writes to say
that SHAKSPEARE'S play would have had
a better chance if it had preceded Mr.
CAUSE'S play.
A prisoner has found a way of getting
even with the Bench. At Maidstone
last week a sailor, before being sen-
tenced to three years' penal servitude
for burglary, made a forty-five minutes'
speech in has own defence.
County Court Judges are insisting
on solicitors wearing gowns, and now
comes the announcement that six leading
members of the profession will shortly
give a skirt dance at a concert to be
held in aid of a legal charity.
As November 9 falls this year on a
Sunday, it lias beea suggested that the
Lord Mayor's Show might appropriately
be held on November 5 instead.
A new rule in Ping-Pong has been
promulgated. It concerns the service,
which many had declared was going to
the dogs. England, Wales and Scot-
land, as a whole, are in favour of the
new rule, but there is some anxiety as
to what the attitude of Ireland and the
Colonies will be.
The British Government has received
a politely-worded communication from
the Russian Government proposing that
direct relations of a non-political charac-
ter may be established between Russia
and Afghanistan "with regard to fron-
tier matters." In a politely-worded
reply the British Government is enquir-
ing whether "frontier matters" will
include the shifting of the frontier of
Russia-in-Asia from one side of Afghan-
istan to the other.
Mr. COKSER, of Worship Street, has
been ordering the destruction of pirated
songs. As between Corsairs, this hardly
shows a proper esprit de corps.

A British force in Somaliland has
discovered that though the Mad Mullah
may not be responsible for his actions,
yet he fights them well.
And the Mad Mullah is said to have
nicknamed our Foreign Minister the
MadMuddlah.
People are still asking why the opera-
tions in Somaliland -were under the
direction of the Foreign Minister. Why
not? The matter was foreign to him.
Meanwhile, Viscount CRANBORNE has
assured us that reinforcements are on
the way, and when these have met with
a reverse, through inadequate numbers,
arrangements will be made for further
reinforcements.
The rumour that Dr. ROBERTSON NIOOLL
is dramatising the last volume of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica is uncon-
firmed. It is probable, however, that
a ballet, founded on some of the leading
incidents of section Bosk-Bunkum, will
be presented at one of the Music Halls.
A distinguished journalist has in-
formed the public that he invariably
jots down ideas—to be subsequently
worked up into articles—at the moment
of their occurrence. In illustration of
the good results of this practice he
states that an idea, which was after-
wards worth five guineas, once came to
him when he was washing his hands.
Fired by this example, several jour-
nalists have made arrangements for
taking a complete bath.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FRACTIOUS PARTY.
[On Wednesday night the Prime Minister, in declining to give the
Irish a day unless a motion should be put down nnder the official
auspices of the Opposition, alluded to the Irish Members as a " section"
of the Liberal Party. Interrupted by a protest, he substituted the word
"fraction," an elementary term in arithmetic. This was regarded by
Mr. T. P. O'CONNOR as the language of insult. An altempt is here
made to reproduce this gentleman's attitude of mind.]
SIR, there are words that leave behind
A singularly nauseous flavour;
Like caviare, in the general mind
They yield a salt and bitter savour;
Whether conveyed in heartless jest
Or in the nervous heat of action,
They tend to sear the victim's breast—
And such is " fraction."
Viewed by itself the word is void
Of all that might offend the feelings;
It is, in fact, a term employed
Largely in calculative dealings;
But in its context, as applied
To Ireland—I could mention cases
Where men, for lesser cause, have died,
Shot in their traces.
Strange force may lurk in trivial terms;
Take cochon (pig)—a harmless title,
At which your Frenchman frankly squirms,
Deeming its sense profoundly vital;
Old friends again have gone their ways,
And ties been rent of man and brother,
Through such a simple-sounding phrase
As " You 're another!'
Now, what, Sir, did the Premier do?
In seeming innocence of heart he
Was pleased to call our patriot crew
A "section " of the Liberal Party!
Is that a name with which to seal
A race that flouts the so-called Lion;
Leaders of Men, like SWIFT MACNEILL
Or BILL O'BRIEN?
We come of blood uniquely Celt,
A self-contained and single nation,
So recognised by ROOSEVELT
(When he declined our invitation);
We are the orb, the perfect thing;
The rest are " sections " ; we enlist 'em
To serve as satellites and swing
Around our system.
"Section" forsooth! He chose the term,
No doubt by way of vile derision,
As used for bits of frog or worm
Demanding microscopic vision!
Then in the lexicon of shame
He found new filth for our detraction,
And from a "section" we became
A vulgar "fraction."
Now, Mr. SPEAKER, let me say
How we, the types of cool dicorum,
We love—none better—to obey
The rules that guide this noble forum;
But there are words that wound too much
And will not brook supine inaction;
And "section," Sir, is one of such,
And so is "fraction." 0. S.
A KISS AND A BLOW.
IF an American Minister's dictum be true that "a man
who never makes a mistake will never make anything,"
then, one of these days, or nights, Mr. FRANK STATTON, author
of Mrs. Willmighby's Kiss, ought to make a name as a
playwright, or better, as a dramatist; and the other FRANK,
Mr. FRANK CURZON, who, being lessee and manager of the
Avenue, is the party responsible for the selection of this
play, will also hit upon some work of dramatic talent or
genius that will take the town by storm and atone for this
"Kiss and nothing more."
From "other lips" belonging to comedians less clever
than Miss ANNIE HUGHES, FLORENCE ST. JOHN, Ems JEFFREYS,
NANCY CLIVE, aided by Messrs. FRANK MILLS, Scorr-BuisT,
G. BEHNAGE, and SOTHERN, the somewhat commonplace
dialogue would probably not have commanded the attention
respectfully accorded to it by an audience conscious of the
author having given to four acts what could have been
effectively told in one.
Nil desperandum, Mr. STATION, and, as Cardinal
Richelieu hath it, "There's no such word as fail!"
"No," quoth Mr. F. CDRZON aside, "there 's no such word;
there's the thing!"
'TIS FOLLY TO BE WISE.
[An American scientist has come to the conclusion that the tendency
of too much education or intellectual development in women is to make
them lose their beauty.]
0 PHYLLIS, once no task to me was sweeter
Than, grasping my enthusiastic quill,
To hymn your charms; erratic though the metre,
It gained in fervour what it lacked in skill.
But now, alas, those charms are like to vanish.
Without preamble duty bids me speak.
The rumour runs that you are learning Spanish,
And also —simultaneously—Greek.
Those eyes, to which I loved to dash off stanzas,
No longer gaze, as erstwhile, into mine;
They 're fixed on Quixote's deeds, or SancJio Panza's,
Or rest upon some ^Eschylean line.
Or, as you spell THUCYTJITJES his speeches,
Your face assumes a look of care and pain.
0 PHYLLIS, heed the moral that it teaches,
And cease to run the risk of growing plain.
Shun, I implore, the vampire Education.
Be guided by my excellent advice.
You owe a solemn duty to the nation—
Simply to give your mind to looking nice.
Learning may be acquired, but beauty never;
Dry books, believe me, were not meant for you.
Be fair, sweet maid, and let who will be clever;
If brains are wanted, I 've enough for two.

THE SO-SO STORIES.
II.—How THE CAMPBELL JOINED THE
BANNERMAN.
N the middle of the
High Old Times,
Dearly Beloved,
there wasa bright
and bumptious
flag - wagging
Dingo-Ji ngo
called the BAN-
NERMAN, who lived
on the right bank
of the Hvphen
. Eiver and fed
on khaki, krumpets, kordite, and every-
thing that began with a K. And he
had a neighbour, a canny, clump-soled
Ikki Tikki Inglanda named CAMPBELL,
who lived on the wrong bank of the
River Hyphen, Dearly Beloved, eating
shamrocks and leeks and other green
and gollopshous things washed down
by streams of fact.
Now there waa also, Dearly Beloved,
a large and unwieldy monster called the

Tory-Lory, with a huge majority and
an unruly tail, which ate up everything
it could stick its teeth in. When it
could not catch Boers and Bulls and
sich, it was reduced to eating PERKS
and PRIMROSES, and when it could not
catch them its Mummy told it to eat
Ikki Tikki Inglandas. And this brings
us to the story, Dearly Beloved.
One day the Tory Lory was more
than usually hungry and appetitical,
so he went out to see what he could find
to fill his vacuous and voluminous inte-
rior withal, and opening his left eye (like
this, Dearly Beloved), ne caught sight
of CAMPBELL on one bank of the River
Hyphen and BANNERMAN on the other.
Then the Tory Lory stroked his
capacious waistcoat and smacked his
lips and approached his unconscious
and deglutitious quarry simultaneously
on both sides of the river at once.
Now up to that time, Dearly Beloved,
the CAMPBELL and the BANNERMAN were
not good friends at all, and they used
to call each other most 'fensive and
'probrious names across the salt and

Bannennan aud Campbell, with the Tory Lory coming on both sides of the river.

tumfy tabernacle.
succulent surface of the River Hyphen.
The Dingo Jingo used to call the Ikki
Tikki Inglanda a Double Dyed Dopper,
and the Ikki Tikki Inglanda used to
retort by calling BAXNERMAN a Union
Jackass, which was very wrong, Dearly
Beloved. But when they saw the Tory
Lory approaching with a voracious
expression on his benign but beefy
countenance, they both spontaneously
sprang into the river, uttering loud
cries of apathetic indignation.
Now, just at this moment, when they
were both simultaneously sinking for
the third time, Old Man SMOOTHER was
paddling along in his light green West-
minster canoe, with a 'digious twopenny
tube of Seccotine, and he leaned out on
one side and pulled in CAMPBELL, and
he leaned out on the other and pulled in
BANNERMAN, and he unscrewed the
'digious tube of Seccotine and stuck
them firmly together. And when he
saw what Old Man SMOOTHER had done,
the Tory Lory moved off into pastures
new, because, although his genial gastric
juices could manage CAMPBELL or cope
with BANNERMAN one at a time, the two
together were too much for him. And
now CAMPBELL and BANNERMAN live
happily together in a trim and tumfy
tabernacle in the shadow of the Caucus
tree.
I 'VE never been to Chesterfield,
Nor yet to Primrose HillJ;
But the CAMPBELL and the BANNERMAN
Can go there when they will.

HOW TO GET ON.
No. II.—THE ARMY.
(Concluded.)
LAST week I tried to show you what
certain people, whose views I set out,
really intended when they spoke of the
Army. I should not do justice to my
subject if I failed to refer to what was
said by an ex-Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH. As
you know, he sent a shudder of alarm
through the country by denouncing
outside influence and favouritism as the
twin banes of the War Office and the
Army. Nobody is quite sure what he
meant, and, like a wise man, he pro-
poses to choose his own time and place
for making further explanations. But
in the meantime various opinions are
put forward. One observer imagined
a War Office and an Army controlled by
the monstrous regiment of women. Pall
Mall and the House of Commons were
pictured as entirely subservient to petti-
coats, withholding promotions until they
were countersigned by the plump and
jewelled hand of a charmer, pushing
incompetence steadily along when, it
happened to shine with the reflected
light of a woman's eyes, and depressing
honest merit because it happened to
know nothing of elbow - gloves and
lovers' glances. It was a lurid descrip-
tion, and we may be permitted to hope
that things are not really so bad as all
that. Still, if a certain experience of
human nature teaches one anything it
is this,—that the support and encourage-
ment of women are not to be neglected
even by the sternest soldier. Don't we
all know, for instance, of at least one
Colonel of a regiment—some of us know
more—who, in spite of the ferocity of
his moustache and the gruffness of his
voice, is entirely dominated by his wife?
Any officer who fetches and carries for
her, who attends her parties with regu-
larity, and helps her little plans, and
generally shows himself to be both
serviceable and agreeable—well, what-
ever else may happen to him, it's quite
certain he '11 never be noted with a bad
mark in any private report the Colonel
may have to make. And there are
others.
There is that magnificent old mar-
tinet, General FURBELOE. He 's six feet
four in his stockinged feet, and there 's
a wild red scar right across his aggres-
sive face. He was the best athlete, the
hardest rider (when he could find a
horse to carry him), and the wildest
liver of the whole Army in his young
days. Now he 's a mere puppet in the
hands of Lady FURBELOE. She selects
his staff, sees to it that his name is
kept constantly before the public, writes
all the telling parts in his speeches,
and keeps him hard at the work of
worrying the War Office. She's a good
friend to her friends—but Heaven nelp
the unfortunate officer who falls under
her capricious censure. She pursues
him with a deadly malignity that leaves
him no rest, and wherever she can put
her private bar across his avenues of
promotion you may be sure that she
will execute the job with particular
neatness and despatch.
The obvious moral is this:—If you
come within the General's military
scope, get into good terms with the
lady. And why not—after all? She's
not a bad sort, if you know how to take
her.
Ought soldiers to be bookworms?
Ought they to bother their heads with
JOMINI and HAMIEY and the rest—or
ought they simply, the mass of them,
that is to say, to keep on in their old
light- hearted, sporting, polo-playing
way? The pundits, of course, are all
for the books, but I 'm not so sure.
What is the use, after all, of the pundits
and the public talking big about re-
forming the army and making it neces-
sary for an officer to devote his time
strictly to his professional work, sparing
such leisure as he can for the study of
military literature—what, I ask, is the
use of all this chaos and welter of talk
unless you can change the nature of the
British public itself? The British
public doesn't love devotion to work;
it detests studying books—and you
can't expect that your British officer is
going to be so much better than the
public from which he springs. All this
chatter about reform, whether of the
War Office or the Army, will end, as
all such chatter has always ended, in
nothing. The War Office, 'preposterous
and absurd as it is, will never be
altered. It will continue to muddle
and waste and blunder, and the abused
British officer will have to march and
fight and get us all out of scrapes in
spite of the dead weight of the ridiculous
institution which manages and controls
him. Until you 've altered the War
Office, abolished it root and branch, you
may as well leave the British officer
alone. For he's brave, he can fight,
and he 's perfectly ready to die. That's
not everything, possibly—but I can't
help thinking it ought to count.
On the whole, then, you had better
try to get on in the Army by moving
along the old lines. And it's quite
probable that when you reach the
patriarchal age of forty you '11 find
yourself out of the Army and unfitted
for any other profession.
The New Belt Case.
OUR democratic age moves fast,
The masses all along the line are
winning;
The rule of belted earls is past,
The rule of belted hooligans begin-
ning.

TO ANTHONY HOPE.
(By a Susceptible Reviewer.)
GOOD ANTHONT (I need not say
We always pardon your "intrusions"),
I 've read your book, and wish to lay
Before you some of my conclusions.
Where other heroines are concerned
I pay my homage quite discreetly,
But charming Peggy Ryle has turned
My head, and captured me completely.
Of her attractions to indite
Is not the purpose of these stanzas;
Enough that, if her purse was light,
Her face and heart were both Bonanzas.
Enough to hazard the surmise—
Most cheering in this vale of trouble—
That somewhere under English skies
Peggy must have a living double.
She had her failings, I admit,
Professed a creed remote from TUPPER'S ,
And oft unchaperoned would sit
At very late Bohemian suppers.
But she was innocent of guile,
She softened hearts, however stony;
She helped the lame dog o'er the stile,
And shared a windfall with a crony.
Imagine then my state of mind,
My curiosity unsated,
When reaching the last page I find
Peggy remains unmatched, unmated!
0 tantalising Mr. HOPE,
Your endings only are beginnings;
Give your invention further scope,
Give Peggy Ryle another innings!
THE EDUCATION BILL.
(The Views of the only Party hitherto
DEAR MR. PUNCH, — I have had a cold
in my head and bean at home and so
heard my daddy talking a lot he is a
seoolmaster. He said so much about a
bill and some claws that I thout it must
be about a bird, very likely a parrot as
it seems to be always talking. But at
last I found it was some new law made
by parlimment and the house of comons
and a mister balfer about the scools.
And there is a gentleman called u sessil
my daddy dussunt seem to like. I
think this mister u sessil must be a
dredful man for my daddy calls him a
sasserdottylis. I dont know what that
means but I think it must be something
awful as it is such a long word. Well
when I new it was about scools I listnd
more cos I am going away to scool next
year and askd my daddy some qestons
but he said I was to prokashus what-
ever that is but I found nobody had
ritten what the children think but only
the groamips who always want to setle
everything.
So now I rite to say that it can all be
settled easely. The groanups don no

what they want but we children do and
that is no scools at all. I am quite sure
that wood be best and then I shodnt
have to go to scool next year. My daddy
said the frenshmen have shut up there
scools and a frenshlady my mother nose
told me franse is a great naiton so y not

My brother horace has helpt me with
the spelling of this letter. He says
heed a jolly site rather play cricket or

he says no one will mind what a kid

So I hope you will tell mister balfer and
mister sissil not to trubble about there
law cos we children dont want eny

THE CALIBAN CRYPTOGRAM.
A CORRESPONDENT writes:— I see in
your issue of Oct. 15 that you sug-
gest the name Caliban as cryptographic
for cannibal, and that you quote " Not
a relation for a breakfast. In this
connection I venture to cite from
the "lively picturesque account" of
Dr. JOHNSON'S visit to Cambridge in
1765: "As to JOHNSON ... he came
down on a Saturday evening . . Caliban,
you may be sure, was not roused
from his lair before next day noon, and
his breakfast probably kept him till
night." On the Monday evening we
hear that he "stripped poor Mrs.
MACAULAY to the very skin, then gave
her for his toast, and drank her in two
bumpers."
THE EDITOR'S TRAGEDY.
[Miss M-B-E C-B-LLI has written to the Gentlewoman to complain
that her name was not mentioned among the distinguished persons who
were in the Royal Enclosure at Braemar. Contrariwise—as Tweedle-
dum would say—the same lady has compelled Messrs. GRAVES & Co. to
publish an apology in a conspicuous position in a Daily Paper for
having allowed a reproduction of a portrait of her to appear in a
magazine.]
THE Editor sat in his easy chair.
He seemed oppressed with a weight of care,
His eyes were wild. There were straws in his hair.
'Twas clear from his look he was much distressed.
What was the anguish that wrung his breast?
What was it racked his soul with pain?
Listen a moment, and I '11 explain.
This excellent person chanced to edit
A Magazine—with conspicuous credit,
Thousands of pretty young ladies read it.
And month after month he filled its pages
With matter adapted to various ages.
There were photographs of noblemen's houses,
And notes on the latest fashion in blouses,
Paper patterns for making dresses,
And portraits of eminent authoresses,
Hints on the cradle and how to rock it,
A new design for a lady's pocket,
And part of a novel by Mr. CR-CK-TT!
But the time arrived—as such times will—
When the Editor had a page to fill,
And no one can envy an Editor's billet
With a page to fill and nothing to fill it!
Should he publish a note upon "Knitted Purses "?
Or a few remarks on "Hospital Nurses "?
Or some of the Laureate's faultless verses?
Or some " Useful patterns for crochet mats "?
Or a paper on " Lady BARKING'S cats "?
Or " A new receipt for blackberry jelly "?
Or " The latest portrait of Miss C-R-LU "?
The Editor's brow grew overcast.
He felt he would greatly prefer the last—
But if she objected . He stopped aghast!
Don't think he was making a needless fuss,
The problem was grave, and he reasoned thus:
"I 'm told she feels such acute distress
At seeing her name in the popular Press!
"That she thinks the Public unduly curious,
And the smallest paragraph makes her furious!
"And yet "—the Editor bit his pen—
"She makes an exception now and then.
If only I knew exactly when!
"But when the exception applies," quoth he,
"And when the rule, I fail to see.
It isn't as clear as it ought to be!"
The Editor sat up the whole night through,
Weighing the matter—and so would you.
Think of the rise in his circulation
If he gave that picture to the nation!
But think of the talented lady's rage
When her eye was caught by the pictured page!
"If I publish the thing," said this worthy man,
"It '11 sell from Beersheba to Dan ;—
But she '11 have the law of me if she can.
"On the other hand if I leave it out,
She 's certain to make a terrible rout.
"And whichever I do it seems to me
I shall have to print an apology,
And a beastly nuisance that will be!"
The Editor sat for several days,
And looked at the thing in a hundred ways;
Week after week he tried and tried
To settle the matter, but couldn't decide.
His once fine intellect grew less clear
As the weeks went by and the day drew near
When the fatal number ought to appear.
Fresh doubts on the subject daily racked him,
Symptoms of brain disease attacked him,
And at last, I 'm told, his proprietors sacked him!

nasal stricture).—Bite is right!

has been denounced as a conspirator,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARL
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Oct. 20.
—Newcomers to the Commons who
Lave heard or read of good old days
of Parnellite obstruction, when all-night
sittings were of regular occurrence,'
below Gangway, bubbling with delight
at discovery that in matter of mean
perfidy an Irishman has gone one
better than his race. From various
benches Irish Members spring up to
shout fresh accusation. In vain the
SPEAKER stands crying, "Order! Order!"
"Answer! Answer!" they roar, bend-

MERELY AN ALLEGORY FROM WESTMINSTER.
"Misther Shpeaker, Sorr, ivid the gratest re-speckt to yew, Sorr, I"
when the larder was kept stocked
with grilled bones, when Mr. JOSEPH
GILLIS BIGGAH was accustomed to sleep
on two chairs in the Library, turn
eagerly to taste revival of the feast
nightly spread under the genial direc-
tion of WILLIAM O'BRIEN. Provided again
to-night; already growing tiresome.
"It's hashed obstruction," says the
MEMBER FOR SAHK; "badly cooked at
that."
SARK lived through godd old days
alluded to; is able to institute compari-
sons and form judgment. Except for
the noise it certainly is dull; depressing
monotony. SWIFT MACNEILL shoots up,
folds his arms, and, threateningly
shaking his head at HUGH CECIL, who
has just come in and knows nothing
about anything," says, "Now, Mr.
SPEAKER." Then, with increasing
emphasis of manner and rolling of the
head, comes a question imputing old
Venetian iniquity to some of his own
countrymen.
To-night, for example, affirmed that
when the resident magistrates forwarded
to SPEAKER report of committal to prison
of Irish Members, Irish gentlemen in
Dublin Castle deliberately burked the
document. Here uprises storm of
boo-hooing from other Irish gentlemen
ing angry glances on the Chief Secre-
tary.
In comparative lull WYNDHAM rises to
reply. Instantly storm bursts again.
Having angrily insisted on his answer-
ing, with noisier ebullience they refuse
to let his voice be heard. Waiting
opportunity he speaks with provoking
calmness and courtesy. In circum-
stances alluded to, he says, resident
magistrates communicate direct with
the SPEAKER. Their letters do not pass
through Dublin Castle. Argal, the hon.
Member for Donegal must be in error
when he says they are there stolen and
destroyed.
That is pretty conclusive, even in
Irish, debate. Does the lineal descendant
of GODWIN SWIFT, uncle and guardian of
Dean SWIFT, admit that he has been
misinformed, withdraw the monstrous
charge and apologise? Not he. He
sits quiet for a few happy moments,
whilst others of the Heavenly Choir
below the Gangway go off on fresh tacks.
Only now and then at rare intervals
flashes over this quagmire of rowdy
invective a gleam of humour. Then it
is unconscious. DONELAN laments the
enforced absence of Mr. REDDY, who,
imprisoned in distant Tullamore for six
months and not being a bird, strikes
his colleagues as being the very man
for Committee on National Expenditure
now sitting at Westminster.
"We appreciate him more in his
prison than if he were in this House,"
says the gallant Captain, and wonders
why gentlemen opposite laugh.
As our dear Du MUJRIER used to say,
it is one of the things-that might have
been put differently.
Later WILLFAM O'BRIEN, shaking his
fist at Chief Secretary, hissed between
clenched teeth the enquiry, "What
are the Government going to do
besides shivering at that Table?" A
terrible thought sympathetically froze
the blood of Members. Was it possible
that GEORGE WYNDHAM, usually a care-
fully dressed man, in momentary ab-
sence of mind, unconsciously influenced
by association with Irish politics, had
forgotten to put on his ?No, he
was fully clad. O'BRIEN'S way of put-
ting it was merely a flower of speech
designed to convey to Irish peasants,
and American audiences addressed by
JOHN REDMOND and JOHN DILLON, a
picture of abject condition to which
His MAJESTY'S Ministers are reduced by
Nationalist Members at Westminster.
Surely such labourers are worthy of
their hire.

THE TRICK THAT DIDN'T COME OFF.
Professor B-lf-r. "Ladies and Gentlemen, I was about to show you my latest novelty—how
I produce the pig from this gentleman's pocket, but his excessive caution makes it, I regret to
say, impossible, so we will pass on to another."
[Mr. B-lf-r 'has attempted in rain to induce Sir Henry C-mpb-ll-B-nn^rm-n to accept the
responsibility of an Irish Vote of Censure.]
House again went into Committee on
Education Bill not to be told in really
decent language. Of course none other
possible to Cousin HUGH. Not the
least poignant pang followed on Cousin
ARTHUR'S dalliance with the Doomed.
He has positively shown tendency to
regard Nonconformist citizen and tax-
payer as if he were in same category
as a Dean, or even a pew-opener in
a parish church. To sit silent whilst
ARTHUR has accepted, even personally
moved, amendments "designed," as
Cousin HUGH puts it with mixed
metaphor due to momentary excitement,
"to open the door to the thin end of
the wedge of the Nonconformist con-
science" is a discipline he accepts in
lieu of administering it to his own back
with a rod, wearing a hair shirt, or
invoking other aids to grace which the
advance of mawkish civilization in these
days looks upon askance.
But, really, after repeated doses of
LLOYD-GEORGE, followed by SAM EVANS,
with ELLIS GRIFFITH in reserve, over
all the monumental figure that would
in ancient times have been Member
for Macedon, and is now content to
serve Monmouth, Cousin HUGH'S carefully
cultured stock of patience is exhausted.
Ten minutes ago, when things were
going on nicely, Committee really
beginning to make progress, PRINCE
ARTHUR to his blank dismay discovered
Cousin HUGH on his legs making a few
remarks upon the Welsh Member. Pretty
to see Cousin HUGH'S gesture, as if he
were holding out by the hind legs some
strange and undesirable insect he had
come upon in the hedgerow at Hatfield.
"There is," he said, furtively pinch-
ing the insect's leg with intent to make
it squirm, "a particular violence about
the Celtic temperament that really
makes no course too unreasonable or too
ill-natured for a Welshman to adopt.
Excited by every conceivable prejudice,
restrained by no sense of decency, what
is to be hoped from Welsh county
councils when called upon to administer
the new Education Act."
Fortunately it was after seven o'clock
when he interposed. Only half an hour
remained of sitting. Throughout, the
fat, flung into the fire, frizzled furiously;
no more work done.
Business done.—Education Bill in
Committee. Lord HUGH CECIL says a
few pleasant things.
Friday night.—Episodes in history
of Mother of Parliaments during past
week naturally excite attention in Paris.
Le Temps, under date October 21, de-
votes space in its Bulletin de VEtranger
to comment on Parliamentary method of
Irish Members. Remarks introduced
by reference to "Le Speaker Butty,
gardien n6 des privileges de la Chambre.''
This is good. Bully for Le Temps. The
idea evidently is that in JOHN BULL'S
Parliament its born guardian would
naturally be named BULLY. Positive,
BULL; Comparative, BULLY.
SARK differs. He believes French
writer vaguely had in mind dear old
BILLY, the SPEAKER'S bull dog, gathered
to his fathers little more than a year
ago. The House and the Country lost
much by the death of BILLY. To
watch him walking across Pakce Yard
in charge of a footman, bent on taking
his afternoon constitutional, was a liberal
education in politics of the hour. To
his dying day WALTER LONG will not
forget meeting him. It happened dur-
ing time when Muzzling Order was
in strictest vogue. BILLY meant nothing
by what followed on the rencontre; it
was merely his play. But a Cabinet
Minister bent on the performance of an
unpleasant public duty doesn't like that
sort of thing.
Another of BILLY'S prejudices was the
Irish Member. If, taking his walks
abroad, he scented one near, his mas-
sive jaw came down with blood-curdling
clang. BILLY had heard of his master'a
"granting the closure." This waa his
method of suggesting it.
Yes, I think it must have been old
BILLY theLe Temps writer had in his mind
when he discoursed on " Bully, gardien
ne des privileges de la Chambre."
Business done. — Ton jours Education

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.
HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS.
XI.—TIME AND THE BARBER.
WITH a hand to my chin I pass
through a swinging glass door and
climb the staircase. Ascending in front
of me is an elderly man in a straw hat,
while a few steps above him I notice a
white-haired gentleman of a military
carriage. Not without annoyance, I
recognise that I may have to wait some
time before being attended to. It is
afternoon, and I know from experience
that the dinner of my barber and most
of his assistants lasts from 12 A.M. until
3 P.M., and their tea from 3.30 until 7.
Indeed, as a class, they would seem to
overeat themselves more than any mem-
bers of the community, and I wonder
that a medical Commission has not been
appointed to look into the matter.
As the military gentleman reaches
the top of the steps, the elderly man
behind him suddenly quickens his pace
almost to a run and, pushing past,
enters the shop in front of him. I
follow the military gentleman inside and
find him gazing indignantly at his
adversary, emitting at the same time a
series of angry snorts.
It is as 1 surmised. There is but one
assistant in the shop, at present engaged
in enlarging on the merits of a pink
hair-tonic to a defenceless customer
with a profusely lathered head. He
has suspended operations at this stage,
while, bottle in hand, he gives his
victim a prolix resume of the strides
made of late in the art of "capillary
nutrition." Two customers are seated
on an uncomfortable bench, sulkily glar-
ing at illustrated papers.
The assistant glances round.
"Five minutes, Sir," he observes.
The military gentleman transfers an
angry stare from the elderly man to the
assistant.
"What d' you mean by five minutes?
he snaps testily. "How can you be
ready in five minutes, when there are
several gentlemen waiting already?"
"I 'm expecting the other men back
every minute," explains the assistant
"They 've gone to dinner."
Here the elderly gentleman puts in
his word.
"Aren't there any papers?" he asks
disagreeably, as he hangs his hat on a
peg, disclosing a head with no tresses
whatsoever on top, and a computable
number round the sides. The military
gentleman, remembering his grievances
darts an angry glance at him just in
time to see him capture the sole remain
ing newspaper. With another snort hi
seats himself beside him on the bench
and, finding nothing to read, glares
irritably at the slow but voluble pro-
gress of the assistant.
In due course the occupant of th<
hair rises from the hands of the barber
. finished article, suggesting an inju-
dicious blend of foreign waiter and
cockatoo.
"I'll do you up a bottle of the
Vivifier, shall I, Sir?" queries the
assistant.
"Er—I don't know whether I shall
want any—just at present," says the
customer weakly.
The assistant plies him reproachfully
with a clothes-brush.
"You 're surely not going to lose it all,
Sir, just for want of taking it in time?"

AWFUL RESULT OF A BEEFEATER "GOING IN"
FOR VEGETARIANISM.
The customer looks wildly towards
his hat.
'' Make you up a small five - and-
sixpenny size, if you like, Sir," sug-
gests the assistant, capturing the hat
and brushing it assiduously.
"Umph! Yes, I daresay I shaL
have some later on,'1 mumbles the cus-
tomer, with a hunted look. "Er—I 'm
going away for a day or two. Perhaps
when I come back . . . ."
"Send it anywhere you like for you,'
returns the assistant implacably.
The customer holds out an imploring
hand for his hat.
"Yes, yes, I see," he says humbly
"but—but I don't know yet what mj
address will be. Perhaps I '11 drop
you a line if—er — if I find I want it."
The assistant grudgingly surrenders
lim his hat, and he slinks out, a con-
sciously contemptible object.
"Next gentleman, please," remarks
,he barber mechanically, as he turns
jack to the chair. The next gentleman
las already seated himself, and is frown-
ng impatiently at the looking-glass,
lereupon the military gentleman, who
ias been fuming throughout the whole
dialogue, breaks out fiercely.
"Get on with your work, Sah," he
growls to the man. "There is the next
gentleman. How much longer do you
expect to keep iis here!"
Ten long minutes elapse while the
,wo next gentlemen are shaved. Either
;hey are regular customers or the barber
las been overawed by our military
'riend, for no more time is expended on
;he Vivifier. All this time not a sign
of any of the other assistants. The
condition of the military gentleman is
causing me grave apprehension; his
'xterior is eveiy minute becoming more
iery, a symptom accompanied at
irequent intervals by the sound of
ominous internal rumblings.
At last the chair is vacated. The
Iderly man and the military gentleman
rise simultaneously and move towards
it. The elderly man reaches it first, and
seats himself heavily; the other snorts,
opens his mouth wide, thinks better of
it, and sits down on the bench again.
The internal rumblings become nothing
short of alarming.
"Shave?" suggests the assistant
with confidence, bustling up to the chair.
The elderly man darts a suspicious
look at him in the glass.
"Haircut," he snaps.
The military gentleman is evidently
past appreciating the value of this
opportunity. At the same time a step
is heard on the stairs. He rises, still
rumbling, and prepares to occupy the
other chair. Straightway another cus-
tomer enters.
The assistant turns round from his
occupation of lining the elderly man's
neck with cotton-wool.
"Ready in a minute, Sir," he re-
marks cheerfully.
The elderly man suddenly sits erect.
"A minute!" he gasps, indignantly.
"What do you "But his voice is
swallowed up in a greater explosion.
The military gentleman has suddenly
burst forth into eruption.
"What the devil do you mean, Sah?"
he explodes. "How can you be ready
in a minute when I 'm waiting?"
"In a minute!" repeats the elderly
man, bristling with indignation.
The assistant explains with nervous
suavity that he is expecting the other
men back every minute.

"Minute !" mutters the elderly man,
resentfully.
The military gentleman is still in full
eruption. "Disgraceful mismanage-
ment!" he cries, furiously, attempting to
put on my hat. "I 've been waiting liere
for hours. I shall go somewhere else!"
Which, when he has got his own hat,
IIP does precipitately, still in a state of
vulcanic discharge.
The elderly man in the chair is glar-
ing at his own sullen reflection. The
assistant, piteously crushed, selects a
pair of scissors. At this point another
assistant enters, brushing crumbs from
a symmetrical moustache.
"Here," says the elderly man sourly,
"send this man away. I want my hair
cut."
The newcomer hesitates, glances at
his colleague, then goes to the chair.
"Haircut, Sir; yes, Sir." I take the
other place, and the original assistant
lathers my chin with a silence that is
far more pathetic than words. The man
at the next chair (after one unfortunate
attempt to introduce the topic of the
Vivifier) has also relapsed into peace.
There is silence in the barber's shop
save for the snip and scrape of scissors
and razor.

of which candidate can hand over the
larger gratuity to the returning officers.
So well known and so openly condoned
is this practice, that in the event of
neither candidate's offer being hand-
some enough the officials decline to
declare anyone elected.
We learn on going to press that
CHAMBERLAIN'S net profit on the South
African atrocities is £1,505,623; while
BRODRICK'S is £673,520. Such are
English statesmen!

In this instance instead of Church
sermonising Stage it was "Stage," as
represented by Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT last
Thursday at Leeds, lecturing " Church,"
in the person of the Bishop of HIPON,
and others of—as SAM GEHRIDGE hath
it—"the nobility, clergy and gentry."
Friendly Leeds! Sir SQUIRE read them
all a lesson on reading the lessons.
His subject (as reported) was "preach-
ing and reading the gospel." How
much more in his line, as experienced
theatrical ex-manager and comedian,
would have been a discourse on how to
read the Acts! By the way, the report
of the proceedings goes on to note that
"among the audience there were many
candidates for Orders." These gentle-
men had evidently forgotten tliat Sir
SQDIRE, having renounced theatrical
managership, has no longer any
"orders " at his disposal. What a dis-
'appointment for some of them!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Confessions of a Wife (GRANT
RICHARDS) inevitably recall The Letters
of an Englishwoman. The book is none
the worse for that, and Miss MARY ADAMS
varies the resemblance by placing the
scene in the United States and illumi-
nating the dialogue with a few Ameri-
canisms. The story is told partly by
letters, partly by a diary. Like the
epistolatory Englishwoman, the American
Wife is passionately in love with a quite
inferior male creature. On him she
lavishes the affection of a fervid heart
and the wealth of the Anglo-American
language. The interest is widened by
the circumstance that the wife is deeply
loved by a rejected suitor, a doctor by
profession, who, with every temptation
to relieve his early love of a worthless
husband, devotes himself successfully
to the task of rescuing him from the
lowest stage of degradation and recalling
him to life. My Baronite frankly con-
fesses that in similar circumstances he
could not have been unreservedly
trusted. There is no particular use in
a creature of the stamp of Dana Henvin
continuing to live at the expense of
better people. However, the doctor is
a fine sturdy soul, and the wife writes
profoundly interesting letters.
"I suppose," quoth the Baron, ad-
dressing one of his Junior Baronites,
1' that as soon as the ship of Father
Christmas appears in the offing, the
public begin to be stimulated by Christ-
massy and Picturebooky instincts. And
as to the new eccentric pictorial series,
no doubt," continues the Baron, after
perusing two "picture-books" with
coloured illustrations, "that the adven-
tures of our friends, the comparatively
recently invented Golliwogs (LQNGMANS,
GREEN & Co., which are not the names
of the Golliwogs, but of the publishers),
in an Airship and at the North Pole,
as cleverly drawn by Miss FLORENCE
UPTON, will obtain a fresh lease of
popularity.
Two Christmas books with Rabbit-
heroes. The first, "The Bunny Book
for Babes and their Betters, written and
illustrated by T. B. A." (NiSBET & Co.),
is rather an amateurish composition as
far as the illustrations are concerned,
nor are the verses much above the
average nursery rhymes. Babes may
be pleased, but how about "their
Betters?"
The second "Rabbit Book" is a de-
lightful little pocket-volume (FREDERICK
WAKNE & Co.). It is the Tale of Peter
Rabbit, with which the children will
fall in love at once. Plenty of capital
pictures, bright in colour and lively in

execution, does BEATRIX POTTER give the
small readers for whom this little book
is primarily intended. It deserves
success.
In the unavoidable dearth of Dog-
days at this time of the year, my
Nautical Retainer the more heartily
welcomes the unique journal of a
rough-haired terrier as illustrated by
Mr. CECIL AI.PIN. The drawings in
A Dog-Day (HEINEMANN) are exception-
ally lifelike and charming, and the
letter-press, by Mr. WALTER EMANDEL, is
a model of terse humour.
The Baron must be among the first
to congratulate Mr. M. H. SPIELMANN,
the historian of Punch, on the present
number of the Magazine of Art (CASSELL),
which is the first under his experienced
editorship. The sepia engraving of " A
Woodland Fairy," by JOHN MACWHIRTER,
R.A., is a charming reproduction;
and the frontispiece, in colours, from
the picture by BYAM SHAW, R.I., recently
exhibited in the Dowdeswell Galleries,
is most effective. "Yet methinks," quoth
the Baron, "that Mr. SPIELMANN, as
editor, is somewhat too lavish in his
promised gifts of valuable works of art
to his persevering patrons." Granted
that, as art needs encouragement, it
may be occasionally judicious to en-
courage its patrons with a " bonus" in the
shape of a work by some acknowledged
master, ancient or modern. Without
such inducement, the Magazine of Art,
so far as can be judged from this excel-
lent specimen of it, will be well worth
a place in every well-ordered library
such as is possessed by
THE COLLECTING BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

TWO MEN AND A TREAT.
THE entertainment given on Saturday
afternoons by Messrs. PERCY FRENCH and
HARRISON HILL, under the management
of Mr. L. G. SHARPE, at the Steinway
Hall at the convenient hour of three,
can be recommended to all who, after
the week's work is done, are ready to
enjoy a hearty laugh, for which these
two entertainers will provide the
materials. Honours easy between the
two; Mr. HILL draws with his pencil
and' Mr. FRENCH with his music. Inci-
dentally, Mr. FRENCH shows how, when
facing the audience with an orchid in
his buttonhole and a glass in his eye,
and making a speech, he can be the
very counterpart of the Colonial Secre-
tary; and immediately afterwards, when
exhibiting his profile as he faces the
piano, concealing the orchid and drop-
ping the eyeglass, he, bursting into
song, demonstrates that there is no sort
of resemblance between the Rt. Hon.
Gentleman and himself. Mr. FRENCH'S
evident enjoyment of his own fun is as
catching as "used to be CORNEY GRAIN'S
laugh and sly "aside" winks; and the
way he lias of taking the audience indi-
vidually and collectively into his confi-
dence is irresistible. Mr. HARRISON
HILL'S topsy-turvy sketches are delight-
fully humorous, and his Kissing Cup
something to see and to remember.

IF I WERE IN.
A pseudo-Villonelle, to be sung to a lively Louland Ayr.
["There are the 'ins' and there nre the 'outs,' and it is right that
the 'outs' should take the place of the 'ins.'"—From Sir Henry
CampWl-Bannerman'a address to the Men of Ayr."]
IF I were in—that is to say,
If England's heart could have its way,
And let me hold the leading strings
And rectify a lot of tilings,
Giving my life, still fresh and warm,
To work retrenchment and reform—
Discord should hush its hideous cackle
Within my cosy tabernacle,
And all our sections cease their rage
And reconstruct the Golden Age;
To such an end my faith should win
If I were in.
If I were in, my chief delight
Would be to champion Manhood's Right.
The humblest hind on God's fair earth
Should be my peer in point of birth;
And none, however sleek his coat,
Should wallow in a plural vote.
Wisdom and genius, high and pure,
Should in their country's hopes secure
With imbeciles but half awake
An indistinguishable stake;
And all be brothers 'neath the skin
If I were in.
If I were in, I 'd run the Schools
On strictly proletariate rules.
The bloated Member who can spare
Enough to send his son elsewhere
I 'd not allow to have a voice
In what should be the poor man's choice.
I would instruct the rising race
To show the Church its proper place,
Till all our infants grew to be
Models of secularity.
This I would urge through thick and thin
If I were in.
If I were in, there should be seen
No Irish wigs about the green.
I would correct the splendid bile
Of Erin's green and gracious isle.
Home Rule all round I 'd squander gratia,
Mutandis, need I say, mutatis.
Meantime no prison bars should curb
A people palpably superb;
But licence, large of lung and jaw,
Teaching a fine contempt for law,
Should merely make the juries grin
If I were in.
If I were in (and not found out)
I 'd put extravagance to rout.
I would at once, with both my feet,
Jump on the army and the fleet;
Then with the balance I would free
The general public's pot of tea,
Unhitch the tax from plug and victuals,
Emancipate its beer and skittles,
And, at a reasonable price,
Erect a blooming Paradise
For honest folk that toil and spin,
If I were in. 0. S.
"GRAPPLING IN THE CENTRAL BLUE."
[Being Mr. Punch's report of the duel between M. SANTOS-DCMONT and
Cointe DE LA YAULX as fixed to take place in the vast inane.]
PARIS had slept uneasily. All night long the lights
burned mysteriously in the offices of the leading papers, and
here and there in the darkness could be heard the rhythmical
"puff! puff !" of gasoline engines.
As the first streaks of dawn began to struggle through
the mists, the sound of the engines became more noticeable,
and presently from the shadows in the North a huge air-
ship slid silently across the tremulous City. A moment later a
dozen were on the wing, waiting for the principals to appear.
As yet the scene of the battle had not been announced,
but soon a tense whisper hissed through the chilly air:—
"THE EIFFEL TOWER."
Ah! At last it was known. The first duel of the new
regime was to take place above the greatest engineering
triumph of the old.
By this time the air was dark with dirigible balloons and
dusky air-ships moving in wide spirals through the silvery
dawn. An anchored balloon shot up on either side of the
Eiffel Tower, and everyone knew that they contained the
seconds of the high, opposing parties, who had in this way
measured off the distance for the duellists.
SANTOS-DUMOJST was the first to appear on tbe scene.
There was something falcon-like in the vicious rapidity of
his movements, and as he circled about the balloon that
contained his seconds an occasional flirt of the tail-prc-
pellers of his air-ship showed clearly that he was in the
best of spiiits.
Your correspondent, who was hovering just above the
scene in an aeroplane lx>rrowed from Mr. H. G. WELLS' story
When the Sleeper Wakes, was constantly sweeping (he
horizon with his binoculars, and was the first to descry
Comte DE LA VAULX as he moved bulkily towards his station
at the other balloon. There was need for haste, for the
gendarmes were already aware of what was taking place, and
were frantically searching for telescopes sufficiently powerful
to draw the law breakers down near enough to be arrested.
Just at the moment when the sun touched the horizon
with gold, tho seconds of Comte DE LA VAULX dropped a
parachute as a signal, and the duellists swooped at one
another with a great rattle of machinery and odour of gaso-
line; but at that moment a puff of wind struck them un-
awares, and before they had a chance to recover they were
separated by several metres. SANTOS-DcuoxT was the first
to adjust himself to the new conditions, but he courteously
waited for his enemy to pull in part of his sail acreage and
make his air-ship obey its rudder.
As the wind had now become steady from the East, ihe
duel was drifting rapidly towards the English Channel,
leaving the seconds anchored near I he Eiffel Tower. Some-
thing had to be done quickly, and it was. Rushing upon
his enemy like an eagle upon a swan in mid air, SANTOS-
Dt'sioxx punctured his gas reservoir with a quick thrust of his
fountain pen, provided for the occasion by a Press agent.
At this, DE LA VAUI.X threw up both wings and sank help-
lessly to the earth. It had been arranged by the seconds
that he who drew first gas was to be the victor.

TWAS not my habit from a boy
To find in squibs a fearful joy,
And still your Roman Candles cloy,
And rockets bore me;
But hearing KITTY would be there
I sought the place of smoke and glare,
And noticed BROWN—to my despair—
Arrived before me.
He danced with KITTY round the fire—
Would it had been his funeral pyre!
I watched him skip with scornful ire
Aloof and sulky.
But KITTY would not meet my eye,
And well I knew the reason why;
I cannot caper if I try,
I 'm much too bulky.
Then brother BOB with visage blacked
Produced a bomb that kicked and
cracked
(I was not privy to the act
Upon my honour);
It filled the boldest with alarm
While KITTY, screaming, fled from harm
Direct to my protecting arm;
It closed upon her.
'Twas later, 'neath the cedar tree
(None but the smouldering guy to see)
She said she 'd always cared for me,
Nor any other.
How could I half my ardour prove,
It mounted to the stars above,
But next to KITTY'S self I love
Her little brother.
THOUGHTS ON THE CAT SHOW.
THE National Cat Club's Show at the
Crystal Palace might have been called a
complete success, were it not for some
drawbacks which we feel bound to
mention.
Firstly, the size of the Palace, though
doubtless convenient enough for Handel
festivals, pantomimes, international ex-
hibitions, &c., is utterly inadequate
when the comfortable accommodation of
cats is involved; for the multitudes of
people admitted to the building must
render the air insufferably close and
offensive to the refined creatures behind
the bars. The Great Organ should
certainly be removed for the occasion;
and if the roof of the Palace were
thrown open, the fresli current of air
would add materially to the cats'
comfort.
The food with which cats are served
at the Show often leaves much to be
desired. Because a cat has a fancy for
a fried sole and a saucer of cream when
at home, it does not follow that she
wishes to be confronted with them at
every turn. The varied emotions of the
Show should be met by some tempting
but unaccustomed dish. If she is used

to veal, try lamb; if fried sole is the
favourite, boil her a whiting. Cream
and even new milk should be avoided
at the Show, being apt to induce sick-
ness during a time of excitement.
Again, the price for adinission being
as low as one shilling exposes the cats
to the nauseous attentions of people
reeking of beer, onions, tobacco, and
strong peppermints; while coarsely
familiar remarks are continually ad-
dressed to such personages as "Woo-
shoo," "Belvedere Tiger," and "Silver
l Lambkin." By raising the admission
to a guinea the management could
i ensure correct treatment of the cats;

stiles might also be advisable to prevent
the entrance of nouveaux riches of a
distinctly vulgar type.

A GROWL FROM GOLFLAND.
BORES there are of various species, of the platform, of the
quil],
Bores obsessed by Christian Science or the Education Bill,
But the most exasperating and intolerable bore
Is the man who talks of nothing but the latest "rubber
core."
Place him in the Great Sahara, plant him on an Arctic floe,
Or a desert island, fifteen thousand miles from Westward Ho!
Pick him up a twelvemonth later, and I '11 wager that you
find
Rubber filling versus gutty still and solely on his mind.
0 American invaders, I accept your beef, your boots,
Your historical romances, and your Californian fruits;
But in tones of humble protest I am tempted to exclaim,
"Can't you draw the line at commerce, can't you spare one
British game?"
1 am but a simple duffer; I am quite prepared to state
That my lowest round on record was a paltry 88;
That my partner in a foursome needs the patience of a JOB,
That in moments of excitement I am apt to miss the globe.
With my brassy and my putter I am very far to seek,
Generally slice to cover with my iron and my cleek;
But I boast a single virtue; I can honestly maintain
I 've escaped the fatal fever known as Haskell on the brain.
A PUZZLER AT THE GARRICK.
SHOULD Mr. ESMOND'S four-act play at the Garrick Theatre,
entitled My Lady Virtue, \iltimately achieve success, it will
be in consequence of the cleverness of the principal actors
concerned in its representation, that is, of Mr. and Mrs.
ARTHUR BOURCHTER (alias VIOLET VANBRUGH) as The Burvilles,
and of Mr. DAWSON MILWARD as Sir Geoffrey Emestone. But
is not Mrs. Emestone, as played by Mrs. ESMOND (alias EVA
MOORE), to be added to this talented trio? Is not this
Mrs. Emestone intended to be the heroine? Certainly she
is, and it may be fairly questioned whether any other actress
could play the part better. But herein is the difficulty, since
the more perfect the rendering of this silly character may be,
the sillier does it become, and, scene by scene, act by act,
the more anti-pathetic to the audience which grows every
minute less and less inclined to take her seriously at the valua-
tion put upon her by author and actress. The highest tribute
then to Miss EVA MOORE'S performance of Lady Emestone is
to say that it is one of the most irritatingly idiotic characters
that ever entered into the heart of man to conceive. She
gets on your nerves more than did the lachrymose wife in
The Tyranny of Tears. If this character had only been
relieved by a few touches of irresistible comedy, all would
have been well; but as it is, the triumph of the actress
means the non-success of the piece. Such is the paradox at
the Garrick.
The third act, which contains the great situation of the
play, is admirably played by Mr. ARTHUR BOURCHIER and
Miss VIOLET VANBRUGH,'with'Mrs. CHARLES CALVERT in the
earlier part of the scene, who lightens their serious comedy
with flashes of her own inimitable humour. To actress and
author we have much to be thankful for in this character of
Basker.
Mr. HOLM AH CLARK'S Lord JJaughley is an excellent sketch
of a character that seems to have been originally intended
to fulfil some important mission, but about which the
dramatist changed his mind, and so allowed him to be, as
it were, pensioned off but retained on the establishment for
some sentimental reason easily appreciated by those who
have experienced the great conveniencs of having, for the
sake of the hero or heroine, a "Charles, his friend," as
confidant, tame on the premises.
Lechmere Gordon, a most important part of about, on the
whole, a quarter of an hour's duration on the stage, is
efficiently played by Mr. SAM SOTHERN. The development of
this character seems to have been an after-thought.
As for the minor characters, everyone of them is well
characterised: the old nuisance of a father, played by
Mr. NIGEL PLATFAIR (a feeble edition of Brother Potter in
Still Waters); the lazy, good-natured Mrs. Lawler of Miss
KATE BISHOP; the lively Dorothy of Miss CLEMENT; the
spiteful, gossiping Lady Carreras of Miss DOLORES DRUM-
MOND; not forgetting Mr. ALBERT SIMS as the first-class
butler named Walters—all are merely ornamental, and not
not one of them, save, perhaps, Lady Carreras, essential.
The piece could be played by six principals and a couple of
good "seconds" between nine o'clock and eleven; nay, if
the author had not started an entirely new idea just when
i we have discovered that the male and female villain are the
most amiable couple possible, the play, in the true interests
of actors, author, and audience, might have perfectly ended
with the third act, as (substituting lunch for dinner) a news-
boy could have shouted "Winner! " outside, and the curtain
would have descended on the husband weeping with joy at
the success of his horse, while the wife, overcome at the
prospect of the connubial bliss in store for them in a new
and happy land, could have looked up at the ceiling and
clasped her hands in an ecstasy of joy.
That Mr. BOURCHIER should fail in the last situation of the
third act is not in the least to his discredit, it being utterly
impossible for any actor to screw himself up to such a pitch
as to turn an anti-climax, as is this weak attempt of Bram-
ley's to snatch a kiss from Lady Emestone, into a triumph.
Act IV. is de trap, as no one cares a dump what has become
nor what may become of the Ernestines husband and wife.
THE SOCIETY SWEAR.
["Among upper-class women the use of bad language is awful; not
only do elderly dowagers say ' D—n !' but girls of seventeen make use
of that deplorable expression."—A correspondent to the Daily Express.]
THE age is unmistakably profane;
Morality, like Trade, is on the wane:
Of late with most profound regret I 've heard
How that a certain naughty little word,
Quite impolite, and quite unparliament'ry too,
Once vulgar, now's affected by the gentry too.
From common oaths my tender spirit shrinks,
I foozle when I hear them on the links;
The cabby's curse my moral system shocks,
I shudder when I hear it from the box;
But that which on the raw more sorely touches is
The swear that's used by dowagers and duchesses.
When in the case of nobly-bred adults
Age and experience yield these sad results,
What wonder if their daughters (pretty lambs !)
Indulge at times in copying their dams?
(A " play 'po' words" which serves to render printable
That which, writ otherwise, would be but hintable.)
Is this Profanity a passing phase
Like Pigs-in-clover, or the Ping-pong craze?
Will it revert to " Goodness me !" or " Blow !"?
I cannot tell you, for I do not know;
Tliis I do know: a nation grave disaster risks
That lets its women talk in s and * e *

And with a humble spirit try
To follow where he leads.

HOW TO GET ON.
No. III.—IN THE NURSERY.
I MUST stale at the outset that in the
following remarks and suggestions 1
address myself, not to those misguided
adults who occasionally intrude upon
the nursery department for their own
sinister objects, but to those who are the
proper inhabitants and rulers of that
province—namely, to the children them-
selves. Crown Colony Government,
vexa'tious and ineffective nearly every-
where, is nowhere so absurd and so
fruitful of ill as in the nursery. My
object will be to inspire in all children
of a tender age a proper enthusiasm for
their great heritage, so that they may no
longer be content to submit them-
selves to the effete despotism of the
library and the boudoir. Men who are
immersed in business or the Bar, or in
what may be called landed pursuits, can-
not fairly be expected to sympathise with
all the passionate yearnings that stir
the breast of a doll capable of closing
her eyes in a recumbent position;
whose mental horizon is bounded
MODERN IMPRESSIONIST ART. A MUSICAL COMEDY.
nor can a mother
by dinner - parties,
weekly books and the acquisition of new gowns, and
whose feelings are dulled by discussions with her cook,
enter into the grief inspired in the heart of a child by the
sudden collapse of a blue air-balloon in front of a fire, or
the loss of such a fetish as a pointless pencil or a tin bath
measuring three inches in length and half an inch in depth.
A nurse, too, imposing as her appearance often is, must be
trained to submit to her constitutional limitations. I am
aware that she is generally appointed to her post not so much
in defiance as in ignorance of the wishes and opinions of the
colony that she is to control. This fact ought to be fatal to
her authority. It is greatly to the credit of children, and
speaks volumes for their natural loyalty, that they have not
hitherto insisted on being consulted before their governor is
appointed. The system must of course be altered, but,
even as it is, a fair-minded nurse will recognise that, though
she may possess absolute power over the perambulator, the
sponge, and the bedroom light, she has no title to interfere
with a high-spirited male colonist who insists on exercising
his birthright of strength and libertv in plastering a sister
colonist's face with a well-buttered slice of bread. Nor, in
general, should a nurse, as is too often the case, show the
spirit of a partisan when an internal quarrel is in progress.
If she, or her deputy governor, for instance, in the course
of her duties has had to separate two combatants, she must
not take offence when one of them attempts to kick her
shins. She must remember that Providence, in the shape
of a dressmaker, has given her a proper protection for these
sensitive bones, and she must reflect that a child who can
attack shins at the age of four may in later life rise to be
the mainstay of his school football team. To chill his
generous ardour by placing him in a corner with his face
to the angle, or to imbue him with a dark sense of being
unjustly misunderstood by administering a spanking to his
tender skin, is to show herself unworthy of her high position.
The meditations of a boy thus partially immured cannot be
salutary, and, if he should afterwards so far forget himself
as to become a journalist, a member of the House of Lords,
a Secretary of State for War or a company promoter, the
blame must be laid on the arbitrary nurse who flouted his
early aspirations and condemned him to suffer degrading
punishments in the nursery.
My object, in short, is to democratise the nursery, to
establish in its full vigour the great principle of govern-
ment of the nursery by the nursery for the nursery. Let
every child from the moment he or she is "short-coated"
learn by heart and, when necessary, quote at its parents the
following sublime passage from one of BUHKE'S (I think it
was BURKE'S) greatest speeches :—
"Sir" [or "Madam"—the form of address will natu-
rally vary according to the parent addressed], "I protest I
am astounded when I contemplate their state of mind who
hold a contrary opinion to that which I have ventured to
express. It has been, and I thank Heaven for it, a guiding
principle in our polity from the time when our scattered
tribes first formed themselves into a nation, so to administer
the various and often discordant parts of our government
as to weld into a harmony, outlasting the shocks of circum-
stance and the mutability of human conditions, the interests,
the affections, the desires, ay, even the passions and the
controversies of those whom we have been called upon to
direct, and this not by the enforcement of a tyranny draw-
ing its power from the obduracy and blindness of the great,
but rather by the encouragement of a spirit of freedom
amongst those whom we may guide but cannot fetter; by
attaching their minds to the constitution of this realm by
links that the voice of folly or the breath of faction will
shatter in a moment, though, applied with tolerance and
riveted with wisdom, they are bonds that no man will
desire to break, since no man will ever be galled by their
imposition. Grant this liberty and your nation will live;
deny it, and you will perish in your obstinacy and your
pricle."
There you have the great principle. Next week we will
consider some practical details.

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY TALKS.
I.—WITH AN M.P.
IT was a fine autumn morning in the
year 2000 when Mr. Punch's Represen-
tative called at the chambers of Mr.
MICHAEL O'FLANAGAN, M.P.
"I will inquire whether Mr. O'FtANA-
OAN can see you, Sir," remarked his
servant. "The House sat late last
night, Sir, and Mr. O'FLANACAN is—
rather tired. Perhaps if vou called
later"
But the visit was not to prove
fruitless.
"Show him in, PAT, show him in!"
cried a voice from an inner room; "I 'in
as fresh as a daisy!"
Mr. Punch's Representative doubted
if Mr. O'FLANAGAN'S appearance justified
this description. The hon. Member was
reposing on a sofa, a patch shielded one
eye, his right arm was in a sling, and
his face was covered with strips of
sticking-plaster. It seemed only polite
to express regret at his condition.
"Bless you, it's nothing," responded
Mr. O'FuvNAOAN cheerily. "Result of
last night's debate on the Army Esti-
mates, that's all. The new Chancellor
of the Exchequer is an uncommonly
efficient man—I don't deny that—has
as pretty an upper-cut 'with his left as
you could wish to see. Still, I flatter
myself lie got a bit better than he
gave. You can bet that Supply
won't be taken again this week, at any
rate!"
"And surely," said Mr. Punch's
Representative, "it will be some time
before you are able to resume your
Parliamentary duties?"
"Oh, no; I shall toddle down to the
House this afternoon, as usual. My
friend MICHIGAN has a question to the
Home Secretary on the paper which is
safe to lead to a row. Pretty fighters,
both of them, and I wouldn't miss their
set-to for anything."
"You yourself, Mr. O'FLANAGAN,
have assisted considerably in making
Parliamentary debates more — er,
animated than they were in the last
century?"
"Yes," answered
with obvious pride,
For instance, I was

Mr. O'Fl.ANAGAN,
"I have indeed,
the first Member
who delivered his speeches in the House
tlirougli a megaphone. Everyone uses
it nowadays, of course, but I was the
first to introduce it. Again, the idea
of making each new Member fight a
couple of rounds with the Sergeant-at-
Arms on the night when he takes his
seat was quite my own. You see the
fruit of this and other reforms in the
increased interest shown by the public
over our proceedings. The Strangers'
Gallery is always full, and instead of
compressing their Parliamentary reports
into a paragraph, as they used to do,
the halfpenny papers give us big head-
lines, and nearly as much space as a
football cup-tie."
"And what," asked Mr. Punch's
Representative in conclusion, "do you
think of the political outlook for the
Autumn Session?"
Mr. O'FLANAGAN shook his head.
"Bad," he replied, "very bad. Did
you ever know a Government like this?
Here we Ve been discussing this London
Electric Lighting Bill for liarely four
months, and the first three words of the
preamble have been passed already. No
good will come of rushing business
through like that."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE HURT OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Oct. 27.
—It would be absurd to assert that
there is anything in Mr. JASPER TOUT'S
appearance or manner of speech, that
recalls the " rift within the lute that,
slowly widening, makes its music mute."
Personally, Mr. TULLT has been slowly
widening for some years, and now pre-
sents to view of the SPEAKER quite a burly
figure. All the same, when he began his
gyrations at Question time, the couplet
leapt to the lips in connection with the
internal economy of the Nationalist
Party. In surveying Imperial and
national politics, Mr. TCLLY does not
see eye to eye with REDMOND aine, still
less with WILLIAM O'BRIEN. The con-
sequence is, as he was cheerily reminded
by a compatriot to-night, he has received
notice to quit his seat for South Leitrim.
Still holding it, he suddenly resolved to
make use of his opportunities for flout-
ing WILLIAM O'BRIEN.
That statesman, looking more than
ever like the stage villain of a transpon-
tine theatre, had several questions on
the Paper. When called on by SPEAKER,
or ever he could rise, up sprang the
Tumultuous TULLY, and in voice than
which nothing could be less lute-like,

"The Tumultuous Tully."
roared a supplementary question—
"arising out of that answer," as he put
it, glaring on the CHIEF SECRETARY, who
had not at the moment had opportunity
to reply. The coherence of Mr. TULLY'S
remark's was complicated by little
passages of arms carried on with his
compatriots seated near. At one
moment he and WILLIAM O'BRIEN being
on their legs at the same moment (just
as if one or other were the SPEAKER),
animated conversation followed. WILLIAM
O'BRIEN, frowning in tragic fashion
that would have fetched the gallery
across the water, made in hoarse
whisper an observation that sounded
like " Off with his head! So much for
South Leitrim."
No difficulty in catching Mr. TULLY'S
remarks, though their purport was a
little mixed owing to endeavour in the
same breath to put his supplementary
question, and to retort upon the brother
patriot with whom difference had arisen.
"The question I wish to ask," he
roared, "is—You are not going to bully
me."
(This an aside to WILLIAM O'BRIEN,
murmuring blessing from an upper
bench. "Yah, yah," from Irish Mem-
bers. "Boo-oo, boo-oo," from SWIFT
MAcNEiLL,in his favourite imitation of the
Bull of Bashan.)
"—wish to ask is, Whether this pro-
clamation of the right hon. gentleman
Here Irish Members, in good training
just now, raise hurricane of shouts.
SPEAKER on his legs; WILLIAM O'BRIEN
also up; TULLY standing well out on
floor of House, apparently continuing
his remarks. In comparative lull SPEAKER
managed to get in observation to effect
that he should have to take strong
measures with the Turbulent TULLY.
Assailed on all sides, T. T. sat down,
audibly grinding his teeth as O'BRIEN
put his question. Up again on O'BRIEN'S
next enquiry; broke out afresh at
evening sitting when O'BRIEN delivered
long tirade against Irish Government,
who will not permit the absolute ruin
of hapless farmers and traders who
decline to kiss the brogues of local
agents of the League. It was then
O'BRIEN, turning upon him, delivered
his memorable rebuke.
"The English House of Commons,"
he said, "is not the proper place for
altercation."
Business done.—Gagged Irish Mem-
bers appropriate another evening sitting.
Thursday night.—SAM EVANS beat the
record in debate; looked in just now
on his way westward from Law Courts;
found ATTORNEY-GENERAL sitting down
after delivering long and luminous
judgment on Amendment drafted by
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD. Swiftly cross-
examining Members near him, SAMUEL
rose and conclusively replied to a
speech he had not heard.
Here and there he naturally tripped,
having been misinformed or misconstru-
ing some hint received. ATTORNEY-
GENERAL rose to correct him. SAMUEL
at once withdrew; but in the look with
which he regarded his learned brother
he managed to convey pained reproach,
that, being on his legs, Mr. ATTORNEY
had omitted to make opportunity of
saying the thing attributed to him.
"If," says SARK, " half the men in the
House, having heard a speech, could

"Please to remember the Fifth of November."
(The melodramatic O'Br-n.)
reply to it as effectually as SAM EVANS
can answer an argument he lias not
heard, the level of debate would Ije
considerably heightened."
Business done.—-With assistance of
closure Education Bill beginning more
or less merrily to move.
Friday night.— .loan O'GoRST, Time-
honoured Educationalist, sits below
Gangway watching PRINCE ARTHUR
slowly shoulder Education Bill through
Committee.
"A good man," he, sighing, says,
"struggling with adversity."
For ordinary Member Bill rather a
bore. Sub-section A. pleaseth him not,
nor sub-section B. either. To tell the
truth, he doesn't understand all their
bearings, diligently voting "Aye" or
"No" according to side of House on
which he sits. For JOHN O'GoRST it is
pure undiluted delight. No office ties;
no Ministerial responsibility; no imposi-
tion of vow of silence while PRINCE
ARTHUR attempts to explain knotty point
which ex-Vice President of Council
knows he could do more simply and
effectively. The mere privilege of
speaking when and how he pleases
alone makes life worth living.
For a while it seemed as if Millennium
was tempered by loss of salary. A good
deal of snubbing may be stood with the
assistance of ££,000 a year, paid quar-
terly. Everyone glad to know that
after long, loyal, brilliant service to his
Party JOHN O'GoRST not been sent away
comfortless. Why he should have been
sent away at all one of the puzzles of
modern politics. As an all-round Parlia-
ment man he has only two superiors,

A ToiTCHIKO SCESE.
"Now, my dear B-lf-r; are you sure you can spare me for so long ?—Oh, don't break down!"
"Well («o6«), my dear Jo-o-seph (sniffs); I 'II try!"
[Mr. B-lf-r has such an expressive face.
implied—it was necessary to be in the
very few equals, on Treasury Bench.
That is another story. Possibly he
felt retention of office would be too
painful when he no longer had the
MARKISS for chief. Howsoever it be, the
Education Office knows him no longer.
But his salary is exchanged for a well-
earned political pension.
Behind a cynical countenance JOHN
O'GoRST hides a tender heart. What
really cut him when he packed up his
belongings at Education Board and
fared forth a free man, was his severance
from the Lords of the Committee of
Council on Education, the final arbiteis
in all matters of national education. This
mysterious body was, to tell the truth,
a creation of his fancy. It was the
JORKINS of the Education Department.
Eemember Mr. SFENLOW'S partner,
"whose place in the business was to
keep himself in the background, and
be constantly exhibited by name as the
most obdurate and ruthless of men ?''
If a clerk wanted his salary raised,
Mr. JORKINS wouldn't listen to propo-
sition. If a client were slow to settle
his bill of costs, Mr. JORKINS was
resolved to have it paid, and, however
painful these things might be to the
feelings of Mr. SPKNLOW, Mr. JORKINS
would have his bond. Thus with the
Lords of the Committee of Council on
Education. The Vice President (and
eke his noble friend the DOOK) would
gladly meet the views of gentlemen
opposite, or indeed in any part of the
House, on the point raised. But 'the
Lords of the Committsc of Council on
Education were obdurate.
The printed words look feeble. To
know all thev meant—still more all thev
House and hear the awed, almost blood-
curdling whisper, in which the Vice
President recited the syllables that com-
pose the name. The Lords of the Com-
mittee of Council on Education have, on
JOHN O'GORST'S retirement from office,
faded back into the mist out of which
their mysterious entity was evolved.
Their ethereal existence, the spell men-
tion of their name wrought upon House
of Commons, are cherished memories that
make mellow the honourable retirement
into which ex-Vice President has been
dropped. Business done. — Still on
Education Bill.
A FULL PROGRAMME.
[It is stated that nearly two score of sugges-
tions that Mr. CHAMBERLAIN should take part in
foundation-stone layings and other functions
on his visit to South Africa reached this country
on the day following the announcement.]
WE understand that the following
invitations for the first twenty-four
hours after landing at Cape Town
already await the Right Honourable
Gentleman:—
From the Malay cab-drivers of Adder-
ley Street: To inaugurate a new cab-
rank opposite the Grand Hotel, with a
fresh supply of hansoms which shall
replace the existing vehicles, now over
fifty years old.
From the Dock "Cape-boys": To
lay the first flag of a private pavement
of their own, running through Govern-
ment Avenue to the Gardens and thence
up the Kloof Road over to Sea point.
From the members of the Bond: To
unveil a statue of Mr. KRUGER in Green-
market Square.
From the General Manager of the
C. G. R.: To consume the first sand-
wich in the enlarged refreshment-room
at the railway terminus.
From the organist of St. George's
Cathedral: To pull out a new stop
on his instrument, and, if possible, to
play a march thereon.
From the Clerk to the House of
Assembly: To address Messrs. THEROX,
SAUER and MERRIMAN in a maiden speech
across the floor of the House, and give the
Premier an object-lesson in Imperialism.
From the Governor of Cape Colony:
To demolish the last brick of the barn-
like building known as Government
House.
From the inhabitants of Somerset
Strand: To open a bathing-machine for
the benefit of that rising seaside resort,
and to take the initial plunge into the
waters of False Bay (before the sharks
come in).
From the trustees of Grooteschuur:
To found a new hippo-house and
elephant-preserve in the back garden
under the fir trees.
From the manager of Constantia: To
sample a new variety of "hanepoot"
grape, and to broach a bin of Govern-
ment wine therefrom.
From the assembled predikants of the
Hervormde Kerk: To listen to some
fresh clauses in the Commination
Service.
From the fishermen of Mouille Point:
To blow up the remains of the "Athens,"
which was wrecked there thirty-seven
years ago.
From the Western Province Cricket
Club: To bowl the first ball on the im-
Eroved cocoanut-matting pitch at New-
tnds.
From the lessee of the Opera House:
To assist at the debut of some recently-
imported "gag-merchants."
From the Astronomer-Royal at the
Cape: To take the chair at a grand
presentation of a new "table-cloth"
to Table Mountain.
These are but an instalment of the
more pressing and early invitations, the
forerunners of some thousands to come
by the next mail. There will be, for
instance, the Christening of " Joeburg,"
the Naval Review at Pretoria, the Pul-
sator Races at Kimberley, the State
Visit to Teteleko's Thirty-two Wives
at P'M'Burg, the Great Indaba with
the Rickshaw-boys of Durban, the
Grand Illumination of the Pyramid at
Port Elizabeth, the Mad Mule-drive
from Grahamstown to "King," the
"Voetzak " into Bloemfontein, and the
Wash-out all over Rhodesia. That such
are a few only of the items of the
Colonial Secretary's first week's stay in
the sub-continent is the private informa-
tion of your late
SOUTH AFRICAN CORRESPONDENT.

[NOVEMBER 5, 1902.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN ARTIC EXPLORATION.
OCR word is as good as our bond,
better perhaps. We had promised to
avail ourselves of the earliest possible
opportunity of seeing certain pictures
by Mr. GORTON CRAIG (whose drawing-
power as an actor is only equalled by
his drawing-power as an artist) on view
up to November 7th, two days after
the festival of All Guys Day. Being
strange to Bayswater, where these
pastels are exhibited, we, arriving at
the wrong end of Queen's Road to
begin with, were compelled to inquire
our way of several polite tradesmen.
The 'bus conductor had sent us im-
periously to the right, and having
achieved a good half mile it occurred
to us to make inquiries of a good-
humoured-looking grocer, who informed
us, quite jovially, that we were walking
on towards Acton, and that instead of
reaching our "objective" we should
find ourselves on the high road to
Ealing, intimating thereby that our
ultimate destination might not im-
probably be Hanwell. So turning back,
we once again hove in sight of Queen's
Road Station.
"Straight on," said a butcher in a
decided tone. "Straight on the left,
and ask again." We thanked him;
but a quarter of an hour of "straight
on" brought us by no means within
measurable distance of the haven where
we would be.
So we " ask again." This time at a
baker's. Now, if neither fishmonger,
butcher, greengrocer, nor chemist can
answer questions as to anybody's domi-
cile, depend upon it that the person in
request is not a resident in that neigh-
bourhood. The baker could direct us
to where we didn't want to go, but
that was not the point, so, like a
"deputation," "we thanked him, and
withdrew." Then we tried the chemist.
Thanks to this judicial and deliberate
personage and to his London and Bays-
water directory, we arrived at the
desired Studio whrre the works of art
whereof we were in search are (at
present) enshrined.
There was not by any means a crowd
in the rooms, as it was about the hour
popular in Bayswater and elsewhere for
lunch or early dinner, and therefore
we had the place pretty well to our-
selves, with the exception of a tall
ladv, possibly representing High Art,
and a cheerful attendant, who handed
catalogues.
"All those with a red wafer on them,"
said he pleasantly, pointing to the
pastels and 'fiftywood-cuts,' "aresold."
Of course this fact was enough to
make him smile, as the red wafer was
pretty conspicuous in the collection.
These pastels suggested to our mind
SE«CI> - OSKK^C-H.


HATS OF A FEATHER THAT DON'T FLOCK TOGETHER.
that Mr. CRAIG'S work might be
generally and correctly described as
"after AUDREY BEARDSLEY," of course
some way after as a rule, but now and
again uncommonly near.
What may be for want of a better
description termed "the gems of the
collection'' are certain impressionist
landscapes in miniature, as for example
Dunster, Surrey (5).
The Hostess (2) is clever, but she is
"sold." For his sketches of Sir HENRY
IRVING in various characters all we can
say is, as BRANDON THOMAS, the heavy
haw-haw swell, observed to WEEDON
GROSSMITH as the noble amateur who
had been giving, as he thought, a
life-like imitation of IRVING, "Why—
aw — I thought it was IRVING." Of
these portraits the best have been
purchased, and are lent for this show.
The visitor must burrow into a corner
in order to examine curiously No. 23,
The Cabman and the Rainbow, a puzzle
picture which is certain to arrest atten-
tion, as, for another reason, will the
pretty face of No. 7. In 68 we have a
weird and original treatment of the old
theme provided by the vagaries of The
Ancient Lady of Banbury Cross, who
is here apparently taking her equestrian
exercise on a dark night, most unpro-
pitious for such an amusement. Pos-
sibly the " belh on her toes" suffice to
warn travellers of her approach, and so
danger would be avoided. This mention
of the Banbury Dame pastehsed, and
the display of small eccentric-coloured
figures all dolly-ish and toy-ish, will
suggest to the visitor the idea, as it
did to us, that great things are in store
for Mr. GORDON CRAIG if he would con-
fine (or extend) his art almost entirely
to nursery wall-papers. He could make
a specialise of them. It's a fortune!
Christmas wall-papers for the nursery!
"PUTTING THE KETTLE ON" AT
THE ADELPHI.
WHY is he called Captain Kettle?
Certainly he has a good deal to do with
"hot water," and is perpetually getting
into it and out of it. But such is not
the case with a kettle. He is a queer
customer,'' a kittle kettle to shoe behint."
And if you 're in the humour for villains,
why here is the best of all villains at
large in the form of Mr. ABIXCDOK as
Captain Pedro Vadez. As for the ladies,
there is handsome Miss ESME BERIXGER
for Dona Clotilde, the melodramatic
heroine, Miss ETHEL WARWICK as Kate
Carnegie, a name so suggestive of
rejected offers—of books. Here 's the
Dona, but where's Chevalier Coster?
Deck scene on the Dona's yacht is very
effective.
Of course, Captain Kettle lias some
good speeches, for what would a kettle
be without a little " spout "? And, on
the whole, Mr. MURRAY CARSON'S gallant
Captain is a performance of considerable
merit. I may differ with Mr. CARSON on
some points, but the public that appre-
ciates this melodrama at the Adelphi is
not to be much exercised by minor
questions of dramatic art between Kettle
and Yours truly, T. POTT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHARIVARIA.
A FOREIGNER who saw some of our
infantry regiments on the day of the
Royal Procession expressed himself as
much struck with the spread of the
Cadet movement in England.
And it seems that there was a boom
in Cavalry recruiting that day. Accord-
ing to a half-penny evening paper, "As
His MAJESTY passed the populace raised
loud hussars."
With something approaching a sigh
of relief the British nation has learnt
from Mr. DE VILLIERS that Mr. CHAMBER-
IAIN'S proposed visit to South Africa
meets with the approval of the Boer
Generals. Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNER-
MAN also approves of his going away.
It is astonishing that not one of the
Liberal organs should have guessed that
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN'S real reason in going to
South Africa is to avoid the humiliation
of a defeat over the Education Bill.
King OSCAR is said to have decided
on an award unfavourable to America
in the Samoan Arbitration, and the
general feeling among Americans is
that if they had known the result was
going to be adverse to them they would
certainly never have consented to arbi-
tration.
Great Britain has given a warning to
Turkey. It has been intimated to the
Porte by the British Ambassador that,
unless Turkey withdraws her troops
from British territory near Aden, Great
Britain will be obliged to adopt what-
ever action she may think necessary.
In well-informed circles this is under-
stood to mean that Great Britain will
then be forced to send a confirmatory
note saying "Please go away."
Miss CORELI.I makes the following
complaint: — " Free Libraries may be
considered extremely detrimental to the
prosperity of authors." But surely in
some cases the readers also suffer.
A female vagrant was last week taken
to a Philadelphia police station with
scarcely any raiment. A dress was
improvised for her from two sacks, and,
thus attired, she appeared before the
magistrate, who asked her if she was
an art-student.
Dr. HOYT, of Detroit, has declared,
after a careful investigation of statistics,
that in SCO years everybody in the
United States will be insane. Dr. HOYT
himself could not wait so long.

occasion to think well of the London
County Council, but the Albert
Memorial is now completely hidden
behind a wooden scaffolding.
Mr. MORGAN'S reproach to Mr. YERKES:
—"Ettube, Brute!"
The general belief that King EDWARD
THE SEVENTH was crowned at Westmin-
ster in August last now turns out to be
correct. The current number of the
official London Gazette publishes an
account of it.
An officer has just discovered a real
river within a thousand miles of the
position allotted it in a War Office
map. He has been awarded the D.S.O.
(Discovery Service Order).
The Mayor of Plymouth recently
handed to the Prince of WALES, at York
House, the patent of the office of Lord
High Steward of the borough. "The
patent," says tho Daily Mail, "was
enclosed in a silver model of Eddystone
lighthouse, which can be used either
as a writing-table, an electric-light, or a
letter-weight." Nothing, however, is
said about a hammock or a skipping-
rope.
My Kingdom or a Horse.
IN the Daily Graphic there was the
following ominous juxtaposition of head-
lines on the day of the Cambridge-
shire :—

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A GORGEOUS binding in blue and gold
attracts tlie Baron's notice to Mr. AXDHEW
LANG'S Book of Romance, with artistic
designs in grey and black and brilliant
colours by HENRY FOHD. This is for the
elder children who were- once Gammer
Gurton girls, but are now students of the
Arthurian Legend. A delightful book.
Likewise issued by the same firm (LONGMANS,
GREEN & Co.) is Alick's Adventures, by
"G. R.," with humorous illustrations by
JOHN HASSALL,-—not bad fun, were it not that
Alick had been preceded by Alice, who went
Through the Looking Glass, accompanied
by her faithful knight Sir JOHN TENNIEL.
Mr. CHARI.ES H. E. BROOKFIEID, hitherto
noted as an actor, a wit and a good fellow,
has written his Random Reminiscences
(EDWARD ARNOLD). It is a delightful book,
crammed with good stories from beginning
to end —and they are all told with such a
skilful care of their point, and with such a
breezy humour, that the Baron's Assistant,
having rushed headlong through the feast,
murmured as he came to the last page :—
You reach the end and wish he 'd just begun,
This Brook o£ laughter in a Field of fun.
Mr. BROOKFIELD must forgive the play with
his name, and count the B. A. his debtor
for a large loan of pleasure and amusement.
Dainty, portable, in most readable type,
are the little books that go to form the York
Library (R. BRIMLEI JOHNSON). Here the
pleasant, simple fiction of a bygone day is re-
vived. The two latest stories are Rosamund
Gray, by CHARLES LAMB, and Tiro Love. Stories,
by ROBERT SOCTHEY. Both are delightfully chosen, and will
be welcome to those who enjoy their literature in scraps.
Side Walk Studies is the title given by Mr. AUSTIN DOBSON
to his latest contributions to 18th century history, just issued
by Messrs. CHATTO AND WINDUS. It worthily takes its place
in the charming library of kindred books, coining from the
same scholarly and sympathetic pen. There is no modern
writor who has so completely mastered life and work in the
Georgian era as Mr. DOBSON. He is equally at home with
men of letters, artists, actors, and (particularly) actresses.
In this new volume he gives a charming account of PEG
WOFFINGTON, its value increased by reproduction of a mezzo-

never before realised the power of her
spell. If she could charm mankind in this dress, the skirt
fashioned after the style of an inverted barrel, what fatal
work would she have wrought had she been gracefully
gowned! Dr. JOHNSON'S haunts and habitations, the story
of the Spectator, the illustrators of the Vicar of Wakefield,
are among the subjects about which Mr. DOBSON delightfully
chats. Anyone already tired of the so-called twentieth
century should turn back to the eighteenth, and, under
Mr. DOBSON'S genial guidance, tread its restful by-paths.
An Antarctic Queen, by Captain CHARLES LAMB (F. WARNE
& Co.), will certainly captivate the boy reader as she did the
heart of the. adventurous hero in this exciting story. After
a varied and wonderful knockabout existence he discovers
an island, which being discreetly placed by the author in
some unknown region of the South Pole, he is able to
commandeer. And the QUEEN thereof gives him her hand.

of an excellent map, and the assistance of a carefully com-
piled index. My Baronite has on earlier editions written
of the special features of this masterpiece of vivid,
condensed, yet comprehensive narrative, which need not
shrink from comparison with KINGLAKE'S laborious and
massive masterpiece. He notes, in proof of the completeness
of the final chapters, that the chronicler records one of the
finest—if one of the saddest—episodes of the War, when

THE VACILLATIONS OF PHYLLIS.
"Mas. SMITH has offered me a seat
for the Lord Mayor's Procession,"
announced PHYLLIS at lunch. "It'every
sweet of her; but I can't make up my
mind whether to go or not."
"Don't you want to see it ?" I asked.
"I don't know that I do," she said
doubtfully, " and yet it would be rather
nice in a way. Do you think I ought
to go?" When she asks my opinion
thus, I know that she inclines to the
other side of the question. But as yet
I was not quite sure which it was.
"I should please myself, if I were
you," I answered safely.
"I should like to go," she murmured,
looking pensively at the claret decanter,
"but I don't think I will after all."
"Why not?" I asked, not so much
that I thought her answer would be of
importance, as that I like to hear her
discussing a knotty point.
"There'll be such a crowd," she
said, "and I 'm sure I don't know how
to get there."
"Where is 'there ' ?" I enquired.
"The Temple, I think it's called,"
said PHYLLIS, much as if she had men-
tioned Valparaiso or Timbuctoo.
"Have you got to get there all by
yourself? " I asked.
"Oh no," she said. "I'm to meet
the SMITHS at Baker Street, and we go
by Underground."
"Then that disposes of the difficulty
of getting there," I observed.
"Do you think Mr. SMITH knows the
way?" she asked.
"Probably; he is a barrister," I re-
turned. PHYLLIS moved back to her
next trench.
"But there will be a crowd all the
same," she objected.
"There may be something of a
crowd," I admitted, "but that will not
matter if you start early." She con-
sidered the point.
"I don't think the SMITHS are the
sort of people who would start very
early," she said meditatively.
"Well, if you feel at all nervous I
shouldn't go," I advised.
"All the same it seems a pity to miss
the opportunity," she continued. "And
it isn't as though I should have to start
at five in the morning," she went on;
"it doesn't begin till eleven."
Her brow became slightly contracted.
"Do you think it will be worth
seeing?" she asked.
"I think you would enjoy it," I said.
Her face became more doubtful.
"It seems a lot of trouble to take
just for a Procession," she said, thought-
fully, "and it isn't as though I had
never seen one before."
"You have certainly seen others," I
agreed.

"Much better ones," she continued.
And Mrs. ROGERS won't have sent
home my new frock by then." She
shook her head with decision.
"Of course, if you have really nothing
to wear "--I borrowed a phrase of her
own—"you can't go. But as you don't
want to go it doesn't matter, does it?"
"I shouldn't like to seem ungrateful
to Mrs. SMITH," she went on, disregard-
ing me. "Still, if I write at once she
will have plenty of time to get someone
else to go. Besides, I should not like
to feel that I was depriving another
person of pleasure."
PHYLLJS'S unselfish scruples are so
curiously interwoven with her system
of reasoning that I uttered no comment
on this aspect of the case.
"And I don't think Mrs. ROGERS
could possiblv have it done in time.
No, I think f will send a pretty little
note to Mrs. SMITH, to thank her and
tell her how sorry I am I can't come."
"Glad you 've made up your mind,"
I said.
She looked at me innocently.
"I think I 'in deciding rightly, don't
you?" she questioned.
"Without doubt," I answered.

PHYLLIS tells me that they found their
seats without difficulty, and that she
has seldom enjoyed a Procession more.

[In reply to a deputation
Premier of South Australia agreed that their employment

IMMERSED in more domestic schemes
Tis yet my way, at times, to wonder
What constitute the leading themes
That move the native breast "down under,"
What fashions rule, what foibles please
In the remote Antipodes.
Accordingly I wish to get
A true report of South Australia,
And learn if local tastes are set
Too much on beery Saturnalia,
And why the Premier wants to ban
The sylph that serves the flowing can.
Laughing across the beaker's brink
I gather how her beauty troubles
The eyes of men and makes them blink
Above the beaded South-Sea bubbles: —
And now she '11 have to cry, poor Circe,
All round the Premier's neck for mercy!
How came her charm? I 'm at a loss
For any luminous suggestion;
Conceivably the Southern Cross
May have a bearing on the question;
Or something in the amorous air
Exalts the barmaid over there.
Reared where the fogs are far to seek
That so obsess her Northern sister,
Upon her burnt and brazen cheek
Old Sol has regularly kissed her,
And Austral winds, as I suppose,
Have put that polish on her nose.
So when I view her British peer
At restaurants or exhibitions,
I trace the force of atmosphere
And other insular conditions,
Causing so large a lack of colour
That I can think of nothing duller.
Go, scan her closely day by day,
And try what power she has to hurt you,—•
You "11 not perceive a single trait
Strictly inimical to virtue;
I find no deadly snare to shun
When purchasing a railway bun.
Yet (I have seen them) some there are,
Excused by no inebriation,
Who like to lean across a bar,
Conducting social conversation;
And seem to taste a fitful joy
In this innocuous employ.
I note the gallant's flowers of speech
With what inane aplomb he plucks "em,—
His fatuous glance embracing each,
The lank and brown, the blonde and buxom;
And marvel, till my senses spin,
Just where the devilry comes in.
Yet would I not pronounce absurd
The trend of things beyond the tropics;
I wait for SEDDON'S final word
On this and kindred social topics;
I wish to draw (without offence)
On his profound experience.
Meanwhile I hope no Premier's curse
Will lay on us a like restriction;
Our youth might well be doing worse—
They might be reading modern fiction;
Or, more unprofitably still.

THE NEW EDUCATIONAL STORY OF THE OLD WOMAN AND
THE PIC.
As a philosophic and urbane old lady was once going
home from market, endeavouring to drive before her a small
but refractory Opposition pig, she suddenly found her way
barred by a series of entanglements set up by the new local
authority. "What," said she, "shall I do with these
entanglements? I must pass them, and I must get this
tiresome little pig over them too." So she struggled on
through half a dozen of the obstacles, until at last, as she
was getting near home, she came to a barrier numbered
Clause 7, so tall and formidable that the little pig absolutely
refused to get over it, but lay down and squealed in the
most alarming and distressing manner.
So she said to her dog, "HUGH! HUGH! bite pig; pigtry
won't get over the Clause, and I shan't get home to-night."
And the dog showed its teeth and snapped, but made no
impression on the pig.
She went on a little further and met a stick.
So she said, "BRYCE, BRYCE! beat dog; dog won't bite
pig; piggy won't get over the Clause, and I shan't get home
to-night."
And the stick threatened in its best Holy Roman manner,
but the dog didn't mind it a bit.
She went a little further, and she met a Welsh fire.
So she said, "LLOYD-GEORGE, LLOYD-GEOEQE! burn stick;
stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get
over the Clause, and I shan't get home to-night."
And the fire crackled, but the stick stiS maintained a
masterly but academic inactivity.
She went a little further, and she met a See.
So she said, "TEMPLE, TEMPLE! quench fire; fire won't
burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig;
piggy won't get over the Clause, and I shan't get home
to-night."
And the See surged and swelled, but entirely failed to
damp the ardour of the fire.
She went a little further, and she met an ox.
So she said, "HiROOURT, HARCOURT! dry up See; See won't
quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog:
dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the Clause, and I
shan't get home to-night."
And the ox bellowed, but made no visible impression on
the See.
She went a little further, and she met a butcher.
So she said, "Chairman, Chairman! kill ox; ox won't dry
up See; See won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick
won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over
the Ckuse, and I shan't get home to-night."
But the butcher said to her, "If you will bring me the
guillotine, I will."
So she fetched him the guillotine, whereupon the butcher
began to decapitate the ox; the ox began to dry up the See;
the See began to quench the fire; the fire began to burn
the stick; the stick began to beat the dog; the dog began
to bite the pig; the pig had to get over the Ckuse, and the
old woman got home at List.
Moral:—If we don't all hurt each other's feelings a good
deal, there is no chance of getting Education Bills through
Parliament.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO GET ON.
No. HI.—IN THE NOKSERT.
• (Continued.)
IN this paper I propose to consider some of the more
important matters affecting the life and conduct of the
nursery community. A proper and sympathetic under-
standing of these is essential to the happiness of every
household that aspires to be well-governed.
First, then, as to
TEETH.
In order that a child may become in the true sense a
consumer it is necessary that he should first be a producer—
that is to say, if he wants to masticate he must get his
teeth out. The process of production is supposed to be
attended with considerable discomfort, but it is a remark-
able fact that no sufferer has ever been able to furnish
direct and conclusive evidence in the usual way, i.e.
by word of mouth, of the pain he or she was supposed to
be undergoing. Red blotches on the face, a heated tempera-
ture, a general loss of amiability showing itself in yells of a
prolonged kind, and a marked disinclination for sleep that
knits up the ravelled sleave of care—all these symptoms may
be due to many different causes. Yet the tradition of the
nursery has assigned them all to teeth. Surely it would be
the easiest thing in the world for an infant to get up and
say, "My teeth are giving me pain," or, "A very trouble-
some molar is forcing its way through my back gums and
causing me to yell in spite of my efforts to be brave." But
is this ever done? Never. On the contrary, the child
makes inarticulate noises and allows its nurse to give the
evidence and to make the diagnosis. The necessary inference
from this refusal of first-hand evidence is that, while the
child ia itself unwilling to tell an untruth, it has no objec-
tion to allowing its nurse to fib for it. This is a very
insidious and repellent form of dissimulation. Let an infant
speak up and tell its own story, remembering that only the
virtuous can ever be happy. No one who has a respect for
the finer feelings will blame it, if, after hearing its nurse
say, "The pore little dear is 'avin' a very bad time with its
teeth," it should say, "My dear mother, I am sorry to
contradict a nurse whom I reverence, but my regard for
truth compels me to say that it is not my teeth that are
troubling me: it is my accursed temper, which I will
endeavour in future to control." So much, then, for teeth.
THE FALL.
The fall may be defined as a sudden and unaccountable
collapse of the legs, followed immediately by the projection
of the body against a hard substance, not naturally designed
for the receipt of such an impact, and succeeded more
remotely by the application of chocolate to the mouth. The
chief thing is so to arrange a fall that it shall produce as
little pain and as much chocolate as possible. Some
authorities consider that no fall is properly executed as a
chocolate-producer if the forehead of the faller strikes against
the leg of a table or a chair or against the fender or the
corner of a cupboard with a force sufficient to raise a
distinct bruise. This is an extreme view, and the argu-
ments used in support of it are not convincing. We are
told that its object is to diminish pain. At first sight this
is attractive, but a closer investigation shows us that the
amount of pain suffered has no relation to the facts of the
case. No considerations of this sentimental nature should
ever induce us to limit the free output of falls by any arti-
ficial restrictions, for we must remember that to check falls
is, indirectly perhaps, but none the less certainly, to check
the consumption of chocolate, and to interfere with the
manufacture of soothing lotions.
There are, of course, many varieties of falls. The most
common, but unquestionably the least effective, is the
pancake fall. This requires no run for its execution. All
you have to do is to stand up, either unsupported in mid-
nursery, or propped against a chair. You then telescope
with lightning speed into yourself, your skirts spreading
out round you, until the extreme crown of your head is the
only part of you left projecting above the surface of the
floor. You are then picked up, judiciously extended to your
right length, and are ready to begin again.
The eighteen-months zig-zagger forward is a very pretty
fall. It is generally performed at a sharp run. You start,
say on the right foot outside edge forward, change sharply
to the left outside also forward, back again to the right
outside for two yards, then on to the inside forward on both
feet simultaneously, cross legs and so fall. The new school
of American fallers has attempted to vary the above method
by introducing a rapid pirouette bringing you on to the
outside backwards on both feet, followed by a half-fall
backwards, a turn on one heel, and so, finally, the old
forward fall. It is a complicated and amusing figure, but
the best nurseries fight shy of it and stick to the solid hut
workmanlike British Style.
The slow backward is a fine old fall. You carelessly
deposit a doll (wax preferred) in the middle of the room, and",
leaving it there, advance to the door or the table. You then
suddenly remember that you have forgotten something, and
that the best way to get it is to walk backwards across the
room. Studiously directing your course to the doll you
suddenly stamp upon its face, trip over it, and so fall. You
then rise with a bump on your occiput and a passionate
desire for a new and sound-faced doll.
The mud-fall is 'equally suitable for London and the
country. All that is necessary is that you should wear a
new white frock, a new white coat, white gloves, and a white
hat. The rest is merely a question of selecting a good
place for the fall. This variety is very effective after rain.
(To be concluded.)
The Gamp Family on Trusts.
IN the Reichstag Hcrr GAMP stated that German export
trade could not subsist without Trust operations (Times,
Nov. 5th). Those who make a study of the science of
heredity will be interested to remember that Mrs. Qamp was
a witness to the historical truth that " some people may he
Rooshans and some may be Prooshans, they are born so and
will please themselves ; " and then follows her opinion on the
"Trust " question, "But I am not a Rooshan or a Prooshan,
and consequently cannot suffer spies to be set over me."
"Two MEN AND A TREAT."—We are informed that in our
notice that appeared last week under the above-quoted
heading, our much amused and most laudatory critic mixed

Hall, attributing to the former all that was done by the

yard inflection, "Gadzooks, who is't?"
After a lengthy dialogue which taxed
our knowledge of the dialect of G. P. R.
JAMES to the utmost, we were admitted
on the distinct understanding that if a
library were offered to us by Mr.
CARNEGIE we should not refuse it.

"We plunged boldly into the turbid fluid."
No sooner were we glimpsed on the far
horizon than the sentinel on the donjon
keep blew the shrill clarion which we
afterwards discovered announces to the
household the approach of danger,
or the appearance of an article by Miss
CORELLI. Hence on reaching the moat
we found the drawbridge up.
Since we had to keep up the legend
that nothing deters a representative of
the Fourth Estate, we plunged boldly
into the turbid fluid surrounding Mr.
CARNEGIE'S fortress, and with a few
masterly HOLBEIN strokes we reached the
other side. To our horror the portcullis
liad been dropped!
There was nothing for it but to
parley, and we therefore tugged lustily
at the bell labelled "Seneschal." In
rather more than due time the Seneschal
arrived, and inquired in strong American
accents, tinctured with a perceptible kail-
Mr. CARNEGIE was in the act of endow-
ing a library as we entered his study.
"Half a minute," he said, "and I 'm
with you. Take a library—I mean take
a chair."
We sat down, and had time to observe
while our host completed his task—the
seventh of the kind that morning, he
told us—that the room was devoid of
books. In fact we did not see a book
in the whole castle.
"Well, Mr. CARNEGIE," we said, "and
how do you like Skibo? Is it up to
Pittsburg, Pa.?"
"It has its advantages," he said.
"There's less Triumphant Democracy
here; but more Monarchy. Between
you and me I like Monarchy."
"And how is the labour of getting
rid of the millions progressing?"
"Slowly, slowly; this is the land of

a theatre. They tell me that's the sure
road to unloading. The Maitre de
Forges with realistic mounting, repro-
ducing the Pittsburg Mills, might assist
me in the task of depleting my pockets.
Then I have thoughts of endowing a
WAGNER Theatre—you know WAGNER is
the only composer who realised the
dramatic possibilities inherent in a
'Ring.'
"After all, giving away libraries is a
tedious pastime; but I can't play golf,
and I 'm too stiff for ping-pong. I
assure ye, man, that a lifetime in the
Steel Works is no preparation for ping-
pong. But come out on the battle-
ments and sec the view. We can see
almost as far as Marylebone; but,
thank goodness, not quite."
We admired the prospect. Mr. CAR-
NEGIE called our attention to a beautiful
imitation oil-well in the foreground,
and a pergola fancifully shaped to recall
the famous sleeping-car on which his
fortune was built. Several elegant
bookstalls were tastefully disposed
throughout the park, and over a clump
of Scotch firs could bo descried the

annuated librarians, several of whom
were taking the air on a miniature
mono-rail line that meandered through
the bosky dells. Occasionally the flute-
like call of the secretary-bird broke the
stillness, as it chanted snatches from
the novels of Mrs. FLORA ANNIE STEEL,
Mr. CARNEGIE'S favourite author. Tact-
fully interrupting the silence, we asked,
''Is it true, Mr. CARNEGIE, that you
are opposed to America's Imperialist
policy?"
"Man alive!" exclaimed our host.
"My fortune was made by contracting,
how could you expect me to become an
expansionist?"
Fascinated by the irony of the Steel
King, we could have stayed for hours
in his company, but suddenly remem-
bering that our clothes were still
dripping from our immersion in the
moat of our genial host, we reluctantly
tore ourselves away from his presence.

If dwellers in suburban villas
Were constantly engaged in strife
With stout and strenuous gorillas?

The wallaby were always seen,
Attended by the wily wombat.

Great bustards roosted in the willows,

Transforming tedium to riot;

Nor fancy stimulating diet.

ARMY ORDER—EXTRA SPECIAL.
1. In order to obviate certain diffi-
culties which are alleged to have arisen
in the case of a number of Volunteer
Corps with respect to the fulfilment of
the present conditions of efficiency, and
to check the flow of resignations
apparently caused by an over-estimation
of such difficulties, as well as to en-
courage recruiting to the extent desired,
the following supplementary Regulations
are now promulgated for the better
guidance and assistance of the Force in
the performance of its duties. .
2. With a view to increasing the
interest taken by members of the" Force
in their work, every Volunteer shall as
^rom this date be required on joining to
deposit with the Adjutant of his Corps
(who shall at once forward the same by
registered letter to the Secretary of
State for War) the sum of Ten Pounds
jn cash, tosbe retained against any
default 6n his part during his'term of
service. This sum shall be exclusive
of any sum paid to his Corps for sub-
scription, expenses of uniform, etc.
3. On the completion of his service
the Volunteer shall "be entitled to claim
repayment of the balance, if any, of his
deposit, on production of certificates of
birth and identity, and provided that
the Secretary of State for War is satis-
fied on personal inspection of his regi-
mental record, that he has in no detail
transgressed the requirements of these
or any other'previous or subsequent
Regulations.
4. For^the purposes of this payment,
the present period of service of all
Volunteers now enrolled shall.be deemed
to have: expired bfc. the date of issue of
this Order.:
5. On and after the date of issue of
this Order' no Volunteer shall "be per-
mitted to resign his membership of the
Force except by the express consent in
writing of the Secretary of State for
War.
6. In order to provide that every
Volunteer shall have full opportunity
to attend the specified number of Com-
pany trainings per annum, every Com-
pany shall hold at least one training
on each week-day (two on Saturdays);
and to ensure that the required num-
bers, viz., an officer, four non-com-
missioned officers, and twenty rank and
file, shall be present at each Company
training, every member of a Company
called for such training shall he required
to attend. Any member failing to do
so shall be required to pay the sum of
One Pound to the Adjutant of his
Corps, who shall have power to sum-
marily recover the same, and shall
forward it at once to the Secretary of
State for War in the manner already
prescribed.
7. No Volunteer shall henceforward
be allowed to plead attendance on the
range as an excuse for his absence from
any Company training. Any Volunteer
so endangering the completion of the
required numbers for such training
shall be dealt with as if he had been
engaged on his private affairs.
8. Any Volunteer failing, for whatso-
ever reason, to attend camp in any year
during his period of service shall there-
by forfeit his deposit, which he shall be
required to make good within seven
days under the penalty of distraint of
such goods as he may possess.
9. Any Volunteer finding himself
impeded- by thei^tature of his business
from giving a due attention to his
military duties shall be required to
relinquish such business. Married
Volunteers, while not actually required
to do so, are strongly recommended to
at once apply for separation orders.
10. For some years past the Volun-
teer Force has constantly claimed to
have sacrificed its time and private
means in the service of its country. It
is now determined that the claim so
made shall be realised. By the estab-
lishment of the principle that for the
future it will be rather cheaper for them
to neglect their business than their
military duties, Volunteers will now not
only find the problem of their conflict-
ing interests satisfactorily solved, but
also have inducements to make their
training their principal end in life such
as they have never previously enjoyed.
11. It is further confidently expected
that as the general result of this Order
they will have the pleasure of finding
that the Volunteer Force has been ren-
dered absolutely self-supporting, a
most desirable state of things in view
of the recent developments in the con-
ditions and requirements of the Imperial
Yeomanry and the modern regular
recruit; while the stability and practical
permanency which will from now on-
wards characterise the Force, should
effectually put an end to all incon-
venient suggestions with regard to the
subjection of the free and independent
British voter to any humiliating form,
however mild, of compulsory military
training. (Signed) BIHDR-CK.

Mr. Clianiberlain. But the EMPEROR

Mr. A. B. Of course. But we ought
to talk German to his suite. It is

would be such charming politeness, a

THE PUFF RECIPROCAL.
FOR some years it has been a custom
with enterprising manufacturers to
advertise their wares by quoting the
unsolicited opinions of men eminent in
the various walks of life. Chief of those
who take pleasure in promoting the sale
of various goods and nostrums are our
literary men, whose emotional natures
prompt them to spontaneous outbursts
of the highest advertising value. But
now that publishers are growing in
wisdom, and learning how much may
be done by "display type" to excite
public interest in their books, we need
not be surprised to see a reciprocity
established between literature and com-
merce. Who would not feel inclined to
pay 4s. 6d. net for a novel that bore
the endorsement of his favourite
distiller, or a poem whose smooth versi-
fication was applauded, and its purity
guaranteed, by the manufacturer of a
nourishing breakfast food? Indeed this
departure seems inevitable, and we need
not be surprised any Saturday morning
to find in the back pages of the
Bookmaker a publisher's list in which
the merits of his wares will be set forth
in this attractive manner :—

James the Sixth and the Gowrie Mys-

that Lord KITCHENER'S ancestors were

KITCHENER by the result of this research
among the "endless genealogies "—the
Vicar's memory will supply the re-
mainder of the quotation—yet he found
it utterly impossible to personally
inspect the ancestral home of his race.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM TOE DIAHY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Nov. 3.
—CASABIANCA TELLY stood in the Irish
camp -whence all but he had fled. On
his legs because he was putting a
question; nay, he had ten on the Paper,
and as he supplemented each with one
still more irrelevant he had what he
called a good time. Procedure under-
stood to be a form of Hibernian humour.
WILLIAM O'BRIEN, who, as TIM HEALY
puts it, is not good for more than one
spasm a week, blew himself out in first
fortnight of Autumn Session. Gone
home to be re-gased. His merry men
following his example, TULLY, at what-
ever cost, resolved to stay on. In
loneliness of the erstwhile tumultuous
benches below Gangway there flashes
onyhim this new development of national
humour.
O'Brienites, while still with us,
accustomed among them to put at least
a score of questions per sitting, addressed
to GRIEF SECRETARY. Very well. Now
they 've gone away, CASABIANCA, left on
watch,"will show that, single-lianded,
hejis equal to O'BfiiEN^and all his men.
Accordingly, knocks off a score of
questions per sitting. This, after long
pondering, is BARK'S explanation. Seems
a little erudite. One is left wondering
where the joke comes in.
Late to-night CASABIANCA received the
following telegram signed WILLIAM
O'BRIEN. "Don't think you can
intimidate us by firing off questions at
WYNDHAM." Is thinking out a repartee.
Worst of performance is that it has
waked up Mr. WEIR. For many Sessions
he has been champion questioner. For
triviality, irrelevance and verbosity none
to beat his string. Finishing touch
given by slow intonation in deep chest
notes suggestive of the graveyard in the
middle of a moonless night. Rather
slowing off of late. CASABIANCA, trespass-
ing on his croft, has wakened up the
old sheep dog. Of thirty-one questions
starred on Paper to-night for oral
answer, over one-half stood in names of
these representatives of the shrewdness
of Scotland, the gaiety of Ireland.
TUIXY had ten, WEIR six. Aggregate
doubled by supplement of each enquiry
with another of added irrelevance.
Stranger in Gallery at Question hour
went home with increased respect and
admiration for the Mother of Parlia-
ments.
Business done.—By grace of closure
Clause 9 added to Education Bill.

be accepted as in any way personal.
Consequently read witli surprise his
reply to polite message from KITCHENER.
On 'his way to India Lord ROSEBERY'S
War Minister stopped to inspect the
Assouan barrage works. Sent a message
to JOHN AIIJD heartily congratulating
him and those who have worked under
him on the accomplishment of a mag-
nificent undertaking.
And what is JOHN AIRD'S reply? Here
it is textually, with apologies to delicate
ears. "Your kind thought and wire
from Assouan greatly appreciated by all
who have been engaged on dam works."
Why this angry, opprobrious reference
to an enterprise the world has agreed
to regard as the most beneficial ever
bestowed on Egypt? Of course the
works have been some time in progress,
have necessarily entailed trouble,
occasionally anxiety. But this exhibi-
tion of petty temper seems unworthy of
a man with a beard like JOHN'S.

most inveterate tacticians in the Boer
army, looked in to hear DON Jos£
make his last speech before journeying
to South Africa. Climbing the kopje
over the clock, they instinctively en-
trenched themselves in the front row
facing the SPEAKER'S chair, commanding
both the Treasury Bench and the one
opposite, on which sat massively con-
templative the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD.
Their brown faces turned with quick
interest to the Table when by it stood,
welcomed by thunderous cheer from
Ministerialists, their ancient indomitable
foeman, the dread DON JOSE. Followed
his speech with close attention, looking
at each other now and then as his shots
went home with the rattle and precision
of the familiar pom-pom. C.-B. came
next, affording opportunity of studying
another style.
When he resumed his seat the Boer
Generals were startled by sudden roar
of execration. Instinctively they felt
for their rifles; glancing sharply round
veld, discovered on a lower kopje on
the left flank of the SPEAKER'S Chair a
inild-looking, more than middle-aged
gentleman talking in rapid speech
tinctured with Welsh accent. The
noise that startled them was indicative
of desire by majority that the gentle-
man on. his legs should not trouble
himself to continue his speech. But
the gentleman on his legs was BRYN
ROBERTS; quite accustomed to that sort
of thing; determined to disregard it.
For a while the Generals sat and
suffered. Soon old habit asserting it-
self, BOTHA turned to flee. DELAREY, for
once demoralised, after brief hesitation
joined in the flight. Racing down the
kopje under cover of the staircase, they
made for their ponies tethered in the
Whips' room ready in case of accident.
Tightening girths they leaped into the
saddle, and to the terror of the police,
inured to motor-cars, dashed across
Palace Yard, disappearing in the friendly
darkness.
What British Generals, equipped by
the War Office, horsed by the Remount
Commission, spent weary months in en-
deavouring to accomplish, BRYN ROBERTS
did in five minutes. Single-tongued he
routed the flower of Boer chivalry.
Business done.—Transvaal Vote for
eight millions practically approved.
Friday night.—Only PniNCE ARTHUR,
Attorney-General, new Parliamentary
Secretary to Education Board, Chair-
man of Committees, and the Member
for BARKS know what it is to spend our
nights and days with an Education
Bill. ADDISON in his mildest mood
exhilarating by comparison. Others
come and go; the vast majority seen
only when Division Bell rings, and
there is opportunity for adding a unit
to their score of votes. FINIJVY now
reaps the enormous advantage of having
cultivated hia boyhood on a little (or
much) oatmeal. In middle age it is
remarkably sustaining. ANSON finds his
new life worth living only because it
affords an opportunity of contemplating
his predecessor at Education Board
seated below Gangway. For him JOHN
o'GoRST has curious fascination. Rarely
takes his eyes off venerable figure
lending added air of respectability to
corner seat sacred to JIMMY LOWTHER.
For PRINCE ARTHUR, with the weight
of Empire on his slim shoulders, this
grinding hour after hour, night after

remember things?! I never can remember
anything—except my handicap, and even that
escapes me at times 1"

night, at the creaking stone of Educa-
tion Bill sometimes passeth human
endurance. Let anyone in search of
information on subject try experiment
of merely sitting for five hours on same
bench whilst others talk. On top of
that physical trial comes for PREMIER
necessity of keeping up the sharpest
mental strain, prepared at any moment
to rise and make a speech on which
may depend fortunes of the Bill, fate
of the Ministry.
If hours of daily labour were limited
from two o'clock in afternoon till mid-
night, with interval for hasty dinner,
task would be sufficient to try some
men's strength. Conduct of Education
Bill in Committee merely an episode in
PRINCE ARTHUR'S day's work. Before he
enters House must have dealt with the
correspondence of PRIME MINISTER of an
Empire on which the sun (which at
least has no Education Bill on its mind)
never sets. There are Cabinet Councils
to be attended, innumerable persons to
be seen on matters of urgent public
importance. Even on Treasury Bench
the red despatch box pursues him, and
with one ear open to debate on which
he must presently reply he deals with
State papers of momentous importance.
Thanks to high courage and naturally
gay disposition he bears up and carries
on. Small wonder if strands of grey
are with increasing persistence begin-
ning to weave themselves in his hair.
The 'orny-'anded British workman, in-
sistent on his eight hours' day, knock-
ing off at one o'clock on Saturdays,
occasionally when wages are high
throwing in Monday, should, in moments
of depression that overtake the Mis-
understood, consider and contrast the
PREMIER'S Working Day.
Bu-siness done.—Education Bill in
Committee. PRINCE ARTHUR gives notice
of a motion that will hurry it along.
HONOURS EASY.
[During an altercation in the French Cham-
ber one Deputy struck with hia glove another,
who retaliated with a kick. It is reported,
however, that no duel will result, as the one
asserts he did not feel the blow which his
opponent claims to have given, whilst the
other alleges that the kick did not reach him.]
OF Box and Cox I sing,
Those Frenchmen lion-hearted,
Who fought like anything,
And parted.
Box used of course a glove,
Cox practised the savate;
Witness, ye heavens above,
To that!
Honour resents a blow;
Pluck comes of constitution;
Has this dilemma no
Solution?
Ah! Cox declines to feel
A gauntlet's feeble flicks;
And Box is triple steel
To kicks.
Box shows his glove with pride:
He struck, he need not shoot;
And Cox is satisfied
To boot.
COMBARRETIVELY SPEAKING. — It 18
reported that Mr. WILSON BARRETT has
made a " big success'' with his Christian
King at Birmingham. The monarch in
question is ALFRED, and he has "taken
the cake." In the old story the cake
was overdone; in the play it may
turn out that this is the case with the
King.

with lonely uproariousness.

Louis (who remembers his Swinburne). Haven't I heard
that last line rather differently put?
Villon (yawning). Very likely. But it doesn't matter—so
long as it is the last. [Lies down to sleep before ilie fire.

Louis (to TRISTAN). You don't like this fellow's verses?
Tristan (crossly). No. And I can't see why on earth a
King of FRANCE should be slouching in a low tavern at one
o'clock in the morning when he might be in his royal bed.
Louis (astonished). My dear fellow, you must be totally
ignorant of the theatre! Who ever heard of a Louis the
Eleventh who didn't slouch in taverns, listening to what he
wasn't meant to hear? We must observe the conventions!
Tristan (grumbling). It seems idiotic.

here comes someone.
Enter KATHERINE DE VADCELLES. She goes up to VILLOI
and shakes him cautiously. Louis and TRISTAN se,
themselves to listen in the ostentatious manner usua.
in costume drama.
Villon (opening his eyes). KATHERINE DE VAUCELLES! (Rising
hastily.) My dear young lady, what are you doing here?
Tristan (to Louis). That's what I should like to know.
KatJierine. I came to speak to you.
Villon. To speak to me! In a tavern? Do Maids of Honour
usually follow their humbler admirers to a public-house in
preference to making use of the penny post?
Kaiherine. Invariably—in romantic drama.
Villon. You astonish me. Well. What do you want?
Katherine. There is a man who is pestering me with his
attentions. Will you get rid of him for me?
Villon. With pleasure. To a man of my easy disposition
one murder more or less is nothing. What's his 11:11 no?
Katherine. THIBAUT D'AussiONY.
Villon. The Grand Constable of France? That's awkward.
Kaiherine. Why?
Villon. Rather a conspicuous person, don't you think, for an
assassination?
Katherine (carelessly). I dare say. But he deserves to die.
le is plotting to betray the KINO to the Burgundians.
Loms (aside to TRISTAN). The deuce he is!
Villon. Then why on earth don't you denounce him in the
Draper quarter instead of asking me to murder him?
Katherine (with dignity). In romantic drama these paltry
considerations of common-sense are out of place.
Villon. Very well. Where shall I find him?
Katherine. Here. I expect him every moment.
T7iZJon. Here! The Grand Constable of France skulking
n a pot-house! Absurd!
Katherine (crossly). Why not? I 'm Maid of Honour to the
[Jueen, and I' m in a pot-house. The KING is almost invari-
ably found in pot-houses. Why shouldn't a Grand Constable
be found there too? (Enter THIBAUT.) Here he is.
Tristan (to Louis, disgusted). Good Heavens! Is the
entire Court going to pass the night at this inn?
Louis (sulkily). It looks like it.
Katherine (to VILLON). How are you going to do it?
Villon (lightly). Easily enough. I shall wait till his back is
turned, and then stick a knife into it. [Does so. THIBAUT falls.
Katherine (enthusiastically). My hero!
Villon. Not at all. Simplest thing in the world.
[Kneels down and proceeds to rifle THIBAUT'S pockets.
Louis (coming forward). Here, I say, you mustn't do that.
That's my money.
Villon (looking up with a snarl). Is it? Who are you?
Louis (majestically). The King of FRANCE!
Villon (jumping up). Then I 'm afraid I shall have to cut
your throat. [Advances towards him.
Louis (mildly). May I suggest a compromise? You spare
my life and I '11 give you THIBAUT'S post.
Villon (scandalised). Make me Grand Constable? Ridicu-
lous!
Louis (testily). Of course it's ridiculous. I 'm ridiculous.
You 're ridiculous. The whole situation 's ridiculous. Bui
it's all right in romantic drama. You consent?
Villon (sullenly). If you wish it.
Louis. Very well. For a week shall we say? You may
not like it for more than a week. And now suppose you
escort Mile. DE VAUCELLES back to the Palace? (Exeunt
VILLON and KATHERINE). Foolish fellow! Foolish fellow!
[Kneels down to search THIBAUT'S pockets as Act drop falls
ACT II. SCENE—Tlie King's Garden. TIME—Next after-
noon. VILLON, gorgeously attired, is discovered biting a
quill •meditatively.
Villon. I sliall have to re-write that ballade. How wil
this do?—
Who is the man who sits in monarch's halls
With every sign of popular acclaim,
First in the breach wherever duty calls ?—
VILLON'S this conscientious statesman's name!
That's better! [Proceeds to write it down. Enter Lotris
Louis. Well, how do you like being Grand Constable?
Villon. Thanks. I find it very agreeable.
Louis. That's right. (Maliciously) I thought you
have a pleasant week.
Villon. Week? Nonsense. It's perfectly idiotic to dis-
place a Grand Constable at the end of a week. He '11 neve
learn his duties at that rate.

Villon (easily). I don't think we need bother about

Ijouis. Never! In romantic drama every criminal fatuity
may be committed by a monarch. But not that.
Villon. You relieve me greatly.
Louis (politely). Might I inquire why?
Villon. It's in this way. The Burgundians are besieging
Paris. I—as your Grand Constable—am in supreme com-
mand of your troops. At the end of a week—if you
continue to reign—I am hanged. What follows?
Louis. I don't know.
Vitton (genially). Why—that I 'm hanged if you continue
to reign! (Dispassionately) That's rather a good joke.
Louis (alarmed). You wouldn't kill me?
Villon (shocked). No, no. Not I. The Burgundiana.
You see I 'm no General. By the end of the week your
troops will be defeated and your reign will be over. The
best of it is I shall still be Grand Constable!
Louis (testily). Nonsense. If I fall, you fall.
Villon. Pardon me. When your enemy's commander-in-
chief is a thoroughly incompetent officer, the last thing you
are likely to do is to deprive him of his command.
Louis (blankly). I hadn't thought of that.
Villon (pleasantly). Nor had Mr. MCCARTHY. You're
incurably romantic, both of you. I 'm a realist myself.
Louis. Confound it all, this is very awkward. What on
earth's to be done?
Villon. I don't know. You see you can't deprive me of
my office because of that Royal word of yours. (Thought-
fully) I might resign, of course.
Louis (eagerly). The very thing! Pray do so, my dear
fellow, without delay.
Villon (suavely). Upon conditions, you know.
Louis (depressed). Conditions? That means money.
Conditions always do.
Villon (consolingly). An annuity merely. Say ten thousand
livres? And a free pardon.
Louis. Couldn't you make it francs? ,
Villon. Impossible.
Lewis (grumbling). I thought somebody said the impossible
didn't exist.
Villon. Yes. But that wasn't till much later. Ten
thousand a year, a free pardon, and the hand of Mile. DE
VAUCELLES! Really, we haven't done so badly.
Lewis (bitterly). You 're easily pleased. But I don't
believe the audience will like it!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Adventures of M. D'Haricot, by J. STORER CLOCSTON
(BLACKWOOD AND SON), is a whimsical story, occasionally
amusing. The hero is neither a "lunatic at largo" like
Don Quixote, nor a swindler like Barry Lyndon, but he is
an irresponsible creature whom it is difficult to place. His
constant lying is irritating, and it is impossible to become
interested in any one of the dramatis persona.
The Baron sees nothing very new or original in the pretty
Christmas cards forwarded for his inspection by Messrs.
RAPHAEL TUCK, excepting some queer figures, with folding
legs, that can be seated about in odd corners; but he con-
gratulates this firm on the half-dozen brightly coloured
"Pickwick Pictures," and on that other merry set depicting
how "a-hunting we will go!"
By the way, while on the subject of Christmassy illustra-
tions, those done for the Golliwog Game (DE LA RUE & Co.)
in imitation of Miss UPTON'S comic creations, will "keep the
game alive" for some time, though the Baron feels inclined
to welcome to his arms the "Beamish Boy" who will slay
The Golliwog. _______
With an eye to instructing the youthful student, EDGAR
PICKERING, in his True to the Watchword (F. WARNE & Co.),
leads his gallant aspirant for the rewards of valour into the
thick of the Irish fight when the second JAMES was King.
It is just a dash of history in romantic surroundings, but as
the history is decidedly biassed it comes out as a rather
incomplete sandwich. Still, most palatable to the average
book-boy. It is well illustrated.
The Wliite Wolf (METHUEN) gives the title to a selection of
what " Q" calls Fireside Tales. They will be found sooth-
ing and comforting in the lengthening nights drawing near.
"Q" is one of few living masters of that most difficult
of all literary arts, the telling of a short story. He is here
found at his best, the selection being marked by attractive
variety. One of the little cameos conveys the moving story
of a stoker putting out to sea in a cruiser of the British
fleet with intent to blow her up by an infernal machine.
He writes a letter to a friend ashore announcing his genial
intention. The missive arrives at a time when H.M.S.
Berenice is already down Channel, making her way to the
China seas. The reader follows her with breathless interest,
turning over page after page, naturally looking for the one
that discloses the end of the plot. It is not to be found.
The Man Who Could Have Told is the title " Q," with grim
humour, gives his story. My Baronite insists that the man
who could have told is " Q," and complains that he doesn't.
My Baronite, noting that Tlie Autobiography of a News-
paper Girl comes from the same House, is not quite sure
whether it is designed as a skit, or whether it is what a vain,
rather vulgar, audaciously uninformed feminine mind would
actually desire a trusting public should accept as experience,
If it be a joke, it is a very poor one. If it be seriously
meant, it is ludicrous. In either case it is tiresome.
A showy edition of the immortal Ingoldsby Legends is
presented by JOHN LANE. Without a knowledge of these
lays and stories no English-speaking person's education can
be considered complete. But numerous, and occasionally
effective, as are the illustrations by HERBERT COLE, they
cannot approach the few but memorable ones, full of the
most grotesque humour, by GEORGE CRUIKSHANK. These
new illustrations are of the Dor^sque order, such as The
Only GUBTAVE did for the Contes Drolatiques, but with a
very considerable difference. Gidliveris also well timed and

always popular, but the artist, though clever, lacks the
quality for the Swiftian humour.
In The Intrusions of Peggy (SMITH, ELDER) Mr. ANTHONY
HOPE makes a new departure. Avoiding Ruritania, its
Court and its soldiery, he is content to settle down for a
while in the Bohemia that actually is approachable by sea—
London to wit. About Peggy there is some perhaps uncon-
scious reminiscence of Tritby. Consciously or unconsciously,
both ANTHONY HOPE and GEORGE Do MAURIER, dealing with
Bohemia, whether in London or Paris, go back to HENRI
MURGER'S immortal book, in which the outer world were first
privileged to get glimpses of La Vie de Boheme. This thing
is inevitable, whether it be due to my Baronite's fancy, or
to the author's early impressions. But Peggy Ryle, though
of the same genus, is all herself, a girl apart from Trilby or
Mimette. A delightful creation, free and fresh as the wind,
warm, inspiriting as the sunshine. An attractive foil is
cleverly provided in the person of Airey Newton, the un-
suspected grubbing miser, who under Peggy's inspiration
blooms into genial manner, boundless generosity, and the
condition of a happy husband. The minor characters,
especially Lady Blixworth and Mrs.'Bonfill, are sketched in
Mr. HOPE'S most alluring manner. My Baronite, again
seeing through stone walls, fancies he recognises in the
latter a London hostess known and dear to most of us these
score of years. THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
"THE Lorando-Tubini difficulty," we read in the Times
last week, "was settled." It will be welcome news to hear
that all Londoni-Tube-ini difficulties have been surmounted.

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY TALKS.
II.—-WITH A JOURNALIST.
THE office-boy intimated that the
Editor of the Daily Wireless was dis-
engaged, and Mr. Punch's Representa-
tive climbed up to the sanctum, meeting
on the stairs a muscular-looking gentle-
man with his arm in a sling.
"That was Mr. HACKITT," said the
Editor. "Plays centre-forward for the
Twickenham Tigers, you know, and is
one of the most valued members of my
staff. Writes our first leader two or
three days a week."
"Then, he 's an authority upon
political questions, as well as upon
football?" asked Mr. Punch's Represen-
tative.
• " Politics?" cried the Editor; "our
leaders don't deal with politics nowa-
days! No, he writes about the things
that really matter—for instance, he has
an article on 'Foods that Forwards
Fancy' in our issue of the dayj after
to-morrow."
"I will look out for it," promised his
interviewer.
"Well, you can see it now, if you care
to. It was published yesterday, of
course—don't you know that the daily
papers all come out three clays ahead V
To-morrow's Tuesday, so you '11 find
Friday's Wireless oa your breakfast-
table. The public insist on this kind
of thing."
"But how do you manage about your
news?"
"Oh, we have a staff of clairvoyants
and crystal-gazers—not that they are
particularly trustworthy, though. In-
telligent Anticipation does a lot. It's
not nearly so difficult as you think.
Supposing you had to predict a House
of Commons debate on a particular Bill
three days ahead, couldn't you guess
who would be sure to speak, and pretty
well what each of them would say? I
thought so; and that's just what we
do. Even if we guess wrong it doesn't
much matter; no one troubles about the
House of Commons to any extent."
"But surely," protested Mr. Punch's
Representative, "you can't manage
everything in that way? How about
the first night of a play, for example?
Does your account of it come out two or
three days before it happens ?''
"We do not print dramatic criticism,"
the Editor replied. "My Proprietor is
fairly wealthy—a millionaire, 1 think—
but dramatic criticism is too ruinous a
game for him. He attempted it once
only. Our critic wrote that, 'in a play
otherwise absolutely faultless, there was
perhaps the faintest vestige of one dull
moment in the first act.' Needless to
say, the playwright promptly brought
an action for libel, and an intelligent
jury awarded him £500,000 damages."
"And book-reviews?"
"Those we keep permanently set,
only changing the author's name and
the title of the work. We declare that
each book is 'indubitably the master-
piece of the century '•—and you can't
think how much innocent pleasure we
give!"
"Since you told me the name of your
chief leader-writer," added Mr. Punch's
Representative, "perhaps I may inquire
without indiscretion the names of some
others of your staff?"
"Certainly—the name 's everything
now, and all our articles are signed.
The city advice is done by a music-hall
artiste; a county cricketer deals with
army matters; and a famous burglar,
out on ticket-of-leave, supplies the
.weather-forecasts.''
"And you really find that they are
the best writers upon these subjects?"
"That I can't say," rejoined the
Editor. "But I do know that the
public loves to buy what they write!"

Down in the canny recesses of Fife?

Look on his eye, how alert and serene it is
Fixed on the foam of the sibilant seas!

Press him to linger, and press him in vain;
Have we not here a recurrence of history?

LITERARY GOSSIP.
ALL the Boer Generals and Mr. KRDGER having taken to
the pen, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN stands absolved. It is now clear
that the South African War was instigated by the publishers.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, whose taste for theatricals is well known,
will devote part of his holiday to finishing a musical comedy
entitled The Little African Milner.
The strike of bookbinders still continues. The title of
SHELLEY'S great poem Prometheus Unbound therefore remains
unchanged.
Profiting by the example of Herr KUBELIK, who is alleged
to have recently insured his right arm for £10,000, an
eminent novelist has insured his side and a distinguished
war correspondent his cheek.
Among the many English publications that have a sale
across the Atlantic those treating of the Coronation cannot
be reckoned. America, however, has a CABBIE NATION book
which keeps its readers in excellent spirits.
It has been established by Frau JOBISKA, the famous
Pedicurean philosopher, that Sir Richard Calmady, the
hero of LUCAS MALET'S celebrated novel, was a connection by
marriage of the Pobble who had no toes.
The practice of literary chaperonage is shortly to receive
an important extension, thanks to the enterprise of Messrs.
Si'BY AND SLICK, who propose to apply it to recent and con-
temporary literature. Amongst immediately forthcoming
volumes are the following:—
One of Our Conquerors.—Edited by General DE WET.
The Haiders.—Edited by Dr. JAMESON.
Sentimental Tommy.—Edited by Mr. T. G. BOWLES, M.P.
The Shaving of Shagpat.—Edited by H. P. TRUEFITT.
The Old Curiosity Shop.—Edited by J. G. SWIFT MAcNEnx,

Scenes from Clerical Life.—Edited by Lord HUGH CECIL.
TJie School for Scandal.—Edited by Dr. CLIFFORD.
Westward noj—Edited by HARRY VARDON.
The New Forest Lovers.—Edited by Sir WILLIAM HAHOOCRT.
The Last of the Barrans.—By Lord ALLERTON.
The Pilot is dead. Its demise has been attributed to too
close an adherence to literary canons.
We understand that Mr. S. R. CROCKETT'S latest novel,
Flower o' the Corn, is quite a serious contribution to
literature, and not, as was originally thought, a skit upon
his own work.
"HARK, HARK, THE DOGS DO BARK!"
YES, these dogs speak to you: they give tongue; for since
the dogs of LANDSEER and ASSDELL there have been few
artists, within our recollection, who have reproduced their
canine models so faithfully, with such life and spirit, as
lias Miss MAUD EARLE in her British Hounds aiid Gun-
Dogs, reproduced by the Berlin Photographic Co., whose
recently published portfolio we may consider as the kennels
at 133, New Bond Street. Mr. Punch, who knows what a good
dog is when he sees one, or Toby would never have been his
inseparable companion, decides that these are splendid
specimens of the best breeds. They are only "heads,"
so it is open to the caviller to observe that were their tails
en evidence we might come to an opposite conclusion. No
matter: as it is, "Heads win."

A MATTER OF GREEK.
PHYLLIS was occupied in studying the
Morning Post. "I'm so glad," she
said suddenly.
"What about?" I asked.
"Why, they are going to abolish
Greek,"she replied with great animation.
"Surely not?" I suggested.
"Well, the paper says it ought to be
abolished," she insisted.
"That is only advice after the event,"
I said. "Oxford has decided to retain
it. But why should you be glad? You
have never had to learn it."
PHYLLIS declined immediately to
explain her gladness. f'How absurd
men are!" she continued. "The Head-
master of Haileybury appeals to every
man who has read Plato and Homer
with his feet on the fender. Have you
ever done that?" She looked at me
with suspicion.
"When I was very young," I con-
fessed. Her eye moved me to excuse
myself. "I had to read them, you see,
and it is the most comfortable way. I
bad the Greek text and the other man
read Butcher and Lang out loud, or
else it was the other way about."
"What -is Butcher and Lang?"
asked PHYLLIS, puzzled.
"They are a translation," I explained.
PHYLLIS understood. "Oh, you mean
you cheated," she said without surprise.
'' Is that what they do at Haileybury?"
"Yes," I said unblushingly. "The
sixth form sits with its feet on the
fender while the Headmaster reads
aloud."
"Butcher and Lang?" she questioned.
I considered. "No, I expect he reads
Lyttelton." PiiYLLis's look demanded
what that might be. "The Head-
master of Haileybury," I interpreted.
In some curious way this seemed to
strengthen her in her opposition to
Greek. "No wonder they want to abol-
ish it," she said. "Besides," she con-
tinued, looking at the paper, "it says
that it is really only the special study
of a few select spirits. It wouldn't
make any difference to them, would it?
They would go on reading Plato and
Homer with their feet on the fender just
the same." There was a certain eager-
ness in her tone. I think she was
touched with some slight feeling of
remorse for her assault on a poor dead
language, and a little apprehensive lest
her opposition might deprive it of all
its friends. My answer, however, eased
lier conscience.
"Are you a select spirit?" she
asked. I shook my head. "Are there
ery many?" she went on, as a doubt
concerning the wisdom of her previous
teaderness of heart seized her.
"No ; " I said, " there are only two or
three."

BITTEN A LITTLE OIBL ASD A POLICEMAN, AND"
Dealer. "LOB! now 'E 's CHANGED, Men! HE WASN'T AT ALL PARTICULAR WHAT HE ATE 'ERE!"
"Then it doesn't matter," she de-
clared, satisfied. "I don't mind about
them. And it will do Greek good, too,"
she continued cheerfully. "The paper
asks if the standard of music has gone
up or down since the period when
every girl was supposed to be musical.
Hardly any girls learn music now," she
looked at me in triumph, "and the
standard of music has gone up a great
deal."
"Really," I protested, "it is not a
fair parallel. Greek has never been so
maltreated as music. Hardly any girls
ever learned it."
PHYLLIS was too much occupied with
her train of thought to notice my shaft.
"Then there is no objection to
abolishing it at all. It will be a
splendid thing."
"But whv?" I asked. "How can it
affect you?
For answer she held out to me two
envelopes, one addressed in my hand-
writing to her, the other addressed in
her handwriting to somebody else.
PHYLLIS'S handwriting is characteristic
—that is to say she fills a side of large
notepaper witli about six words—white
mine is small and neat.
"Which is the best writing?" she
demanded.
Politeness forbade my expressing an
opinion.
She took my silence for admission.
"Well, all you men who write in that
silly little hand say it is because you 've
written so much Greek. If you hadn't
you'd write in a sensible way,"—she
looked complacently at her envelope—
"and one wouldn't need a microscope to
read your letters."
"Your argument is absolutely clinch-
ing," I said.

and cries apologetically, "Spare me your strictly dramatic
criticism! 0 please, Sir, don't! it's only a 'Fantasy!'"
It is not put before the public as a dream after the fashion
of A Message from Mars and a select number of previous
impossibilities. No: here in this "Fantasy" (we thank
thee, Mr. BARBIE, for teaching us the word) the characters
are all real personages of flesh and blood (as if the intensely
diverting Mr. HENRY KEMBLE, no magni nominis umbra,
could be anything else!) as they would appear in ordinary
life, here fantastically employee! in teaching per fdbulam
the common-sense moral lesson of the catechism which bids
the small and early Christian to be content with that station
in life to which it has pleased Providence to call him.
TOM ROBERTSON'S Caste taught the same lesson in a homely
way, without phrase or "Fantasy." So did The Lady of
Lyons in high falutin' romantic style. This fantasy is a
queer mixture of comedy, extravaganza, farce and tragedy,
in which the farcical and extravagant elements preponderate,
and, as the garlic in the salad, "animate the whole."
Accepting the entertainment then at the author's own
valuation of it, we say that as an eccentric conception it
has been admirably perfected by its author and is irre-
proachably carried out by the exceptional cast brought
together under the able stage - managership of Mr. DION
BOUCIOADLT, whose attention to the smallest details is the
best evidence of his competence for the task. So the
audience, under the glamour of the combined power of these
magicians, sit mesmerised, thoroughly enjoying the "visions
about" until the curtain descends and the dream is over,
when once again they are awakened to the realities of life.
Certainly, Mr. BARRIE and Co., "let us dream again!"
The ladies of the " Lasenby " family (why has Mr. BARBIE
thus spelt this name? Is it to show that the girls are not
"sauce-y?") as represented by Miss IRENE VANBRUGH, the
light and leading spirit of the "sisters three," by Miss
SYBIL CARLISLE and Miss MURIEL BEADMONT, exhibit them-
selves as modern types on true comedy lines; and Miss
MARGARET FRASER, as Fisher, the lady's maid, shows a keen
appreciation of humour. Miss PATTIE BROWNE is most
amusing as Tweeny, the highly-coloured cockney scuJlery-
maid of old-fashioned farce (type Betsy Baker, and the
parts in which Mrs. KEELEY and Miss WOOLGAR excelled),
presumably carrying out the author's intentions; so is
Miss FANNY COLEMAN as the Countess of Broddehurst,
which is (" fantasy" apart) by far the best written comedy
character in the piece, excepting perhaps that of the Hon.
Ernest Woolley, so artistically played by Mr. GERAID DD
MAURIER as to be the one part in the "Fantasy" that
catches on with the public, simply because, like that of
the Countess, it belongs not to any sort or kind of
"Fantasy," but to genuine human nature as reflected in the
clear mirror of comedy. As dreams fantastically reproduce
scenes in real life, so here in this fantasy we come upon a
reminiscence of The Overland 1'ntd,- and Foul Play, which,
when burlesqued in Mr. Punch'adages, Mr. Du MAUHIER'S
father so humorously illustrated. The two fantastic Acts
on "the island " afford splendid opportunities to the artist,
of which Mr. BERNARD PARTRIDGE has made the most. All
his costumes are as charmingly picturesque as, without any
sacrifice of probability, they are eccentric and original.
As the Rev. John Treherne Mr. CLARENCE BLAKISTON gives
a capital comedy rendering of the modern young cricketing
clergyman, with as little of the "fantasy" about him as
there is about Mr. CARTER PICKFORD'S up-to-date young Lord
Broeklehurst. Mr. COMPTON COUTTS imparts individuality to
the small part of Tompsett, the coachman, and Mr. J. C.
BCCKSTONE is a cheery specimen of the brisk, white-
duck'd naval officer who is always such a favourite in the
Gaiety-Daly-George-Edwardesy musical mixtures; only in
this "Fantasy " the "nautical gent " without a name in the
bill (so typical of a naval hero's modesty) has no song,
nor does he even take part in a chorus, as, alas, he arrives
just too late for the spirited dance in which all the characters,
in true burlesque vein, have been heartily indulging.
The principal part we have kept for the last, The
Admirable Crichton, the Earl of Loam's butler, who is
the central figure of this whirligig fantastical system.
This ordinarily impossible person Mr. H. B. IRVING makes
possible. Heart and soul he throws himself into this original
and perplexing^ creation of Mr. BARRIE'S. Were this part
played one hair's breadth less consistently than it is by
Mr. H. B. IRVING, the interval between the premiere and the
last night of this "Fantasy" would, probably, not have
been very considerable. Mr. BARRIE is to be congratulated
on Mr. H. B. IRVING, and Mr. H. B. IRVING is to be
complimented on his subtle rendering of a most difficult
character. It is a triumph for the actor; and as he walks
up the stage and the curtain descends, we rub our eyes,
pull ourselves together, and the "Fantasy" is over.
ANY CUSTOMER TO ANY WAITRESS.

girls left the company's service to marry. It was the custom of the
directors to make each girl a small present in addition to a wedding
cake.]

STOOT oak and triple brass were round
The heart which first did dare
To leave tlie fixed and solid ground
And soar aloft, without a sound,
In silken vessel, upward bound,
Upon the empty air.
Beyond the eagle's utmost flight
His fearless course he steered;
Men dwindled fast to pigmies' height,
The pigmy, too, became a mite,
The mitey atom, lost to sight,
In nothing disappeared.
This great and solid earth, the scene
Of mortal joy and woe,
In tiny squares of brown and green
With toy-like fences in between,
Absurdly small, grotesquely mean,
Lay like a map below.
He saw the storm beneath him blown,
He felt its icy breath;
He flew where bird had never flown,
Beyond the clouds, by ways unknown—
The frailest film of silk alone
'Twixt him and instant death.
In vain the gods with seas of sky
K- Have severed all the stars,
And bid their worlds asunder lie,
If swifter than the winds that fly
At tempest speed, our airships ply
'Twixt Jupiter and Mars.
What deed that mortals dare not do,
'However rash it be?
The cunning Daedalus, who knew
All arts, on crafty pinions flew,
While Icarus, plunged in billows blue,
Renamed a fatal sea.
And now our impious barques we guide
Amid the stars. 0 dolts!
Puffed up with insolence and pride,
Not heaven itself we leave untried,
Nor suffer Jove to lay aside
His deadly thunderbolts.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO GET ON.
No. IH.—IN THE NURSERY.
(Concluded.)
THE next subject for consideration is that of MEALS, which
divides itself naturally into three branches:—Hours,
Materials, and Behaviour.
MEALS: THEIR HOURS.
It may be laid down as an axiom that practically any
hour is a good and convenient one for a meal. It must be
understood, of course, that in the word meal I include not
merely breakfast, dinner and tea, those more or less
ceremonious events over which the governor of the nursery
presides in state, but also those snatched and intervening
feasts on chocolate or cake or fruit which are the chief joys
of early existence. It is, no doubt, convenient to fix break-
fast for 8 A.M., dinner for 1 P.M., and tea (which, by the
way, is not really tea, but milk) for 5 P.M., but no human
child can possibly foresee the precise moment at which he
may be able through cajolery or force or fraud to secure a
chocolate cream with a pink interior or to retire into a
remote corner for the purpose of swallowing an annexed
sponge-cake. It may happen to him to see and to seize the
object of his desires as he goes out for his morning walk or
when he is brought into the drawing-room an hour or so
before bed-time. As he will want to .eat it at once it would
be absurd to hamper him by any rigid rule about hours.
I ought to mention, before leaving this part of the subject,
that the minute fragmentary remains of a biscuit partially
consumed in bed form an admirable top-dressing for a
mattress. As a sleep-compeller nothing in the whole range
of soothing syrups equals a scattering of biscuit-crumbs in
bed.
MEALS: THEIR MATERIALS.
There has been much heated controversy on this matter.
Some have advocated bread and milk, others have pinned
their faith to gravy; a third school swears by minced
chicken, and yet a fourth will hear of nothing but boiled or
poached eggs. It is idle to discuss in detail all the argu-
ments by which these various theorists seek to prove their
different points and to establish the unchallenged supremacy
of the article they prefer. The chief thing to remember is
that they are merely theorists and not practical nursery
inhabitants. As, being invariably adults, they are not them-
selves required to eat the food about which they talk, and,
as a matter of fact, never do eat it, their doctrines ought
to be disregarded. Children, on the other hand, speak from
experience, and theirs is the only evidence that can properly
be admitted. I have made it my duty to collect the opinions
of some of the leading nurseries, and, as a result, I
am justified in declaring that raspberry jam, orange jelly,
plum cake heavily iced, and stewed fruit of various sorts,
are the only materials which a self-respecting child should
be asked to consume at the three so-called regular meals of
the day. Anything else as a fixed article of diet should be
sternly resisted—though a possible exception may be made
in favour of a fried sole (but only the top part, where it is
brown and crisp), or a baked apple. It is necessary to
state in the most emphatic manner that milk puddings must
be rigorously excluded, not merely or even chiefly because
all children mistrust them, but because their effect upon the
health and morals of the nursery is incalculably pernicious.
Many a child who might otherwise have grown to be a happy
and prosperous member of the community has had its
temper permanently soured by sago, while ita physical con-
stitution lias been sapped by semolina. Rice, too, is now
known to be a deadly instrument for the perversion of
character. No: give me raspberry jam, or rather give it
to your nursery, and you will get an atmosphere of idyllic
contentment, mitigated, perhaps, but not seriously impaired,
by doctors' bills.
MEALS: BEHAVIOUR AT.
Every child should suit himself or herself. Behaviour
that is enforced from the outside is of no value. Only the
behaviour that springs from the heart, and is thus the true
expression of a child's character, can be allowed to count.
If, for instance, a boy decides that instead of receiving his
food into his mouth he will dabble it carelessly over his
cheeks, or will watch its course as it meanders down his
feeder, he must on no account be interfered with. The
cheeks are his own, and so is the feeder. Again, if a girl-
child, after eating a baked apple from her hands, attempts
to wipe them on her nurse's frock or her little sister's hair,
she must be allowed to do so. Nothing impedes a child so
much as a display of unreasoning anger on the part of
adults. Cheerfulness ought always to prevail in a nursery,
but this is impossible if the whole day is to be taken up in
administering correction or punishment for mere exuberance
of feeling or energy.
And here I may bring my remarks on the Nursery to a
close. I have written in no spirit of factious opposition to
parents or nursea. I have merely pointed out with perfect
moderation how often—I might say, how invariably—they
do wrong in the ordering of their nurseries. If some of
them who may read these words can be induced to pause in
their mad careers, I shall not have written in vain.
A CASE OF CONSCIENCE.
Scrupulous Person (from the Sister Isle, meeting Father
TOM, P. P., in London). You 're just the man I wanted to
see! I 'm not at all sure I did right in staying out The
Eternal City at His Majesty's.
Father Tom. Well, my boy, where's the difficulty?
Scrupulous Person. Tis this way. The Holy Father is
represented on the stage—and mighty well he looks, too—
but I 'm not certain I didn't do wrong not to have come away
there and then.
Father Tom (considering). You stopped to see it all?
Scrupulous Person. I did. I saw every scene -with the
Pope in it; but if I was satisfied with him I wasn't with
myself. Now (puzzled] tell me, would I make it a matter
for confession?
Father Tom (seriously). I can only say that if you come
to me, I '11 give you a penance for it.
Scrupulous Person (beginning to regret his confidence}.
What would it be?
Father Tom (with increasing severity). It would be a
severe penance! I 'd order you to go and see the piece
again. [Exit Father Toir.
THE "MANSION HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE PORT OF LONDON."
—This ought to be the very best of all committees. Unless
tradition utterly belies them, the worthy citizens who do
justice to the wine, and freely pass the bottle at the Mansion
House (known in these pages aforetime as "the Munching
House") ought to be the best possible authorities not only
on "the Port of London," but on the Port of everywhere
eke; though, of course, London is the wine-merchants'
centre of trade. We await the re-port of their verdict with
interest. Let these Magnums (or Magnates) lay down the
law, and we will lay down the Port.
SOMETHING IN A NAME.—Politics are not supposed to enter
into the question of a Common Councillor's election, but is
it not a legitimate deduction to infer that the successful
candidate for Aldgate Ward, Mr. MARRIAGE, is a Unionist?

OH, excellent decision this!
Authorities at length awaken,
And, realising what's amiss,
A very proper .step they 've taken.
It surely did not need the aid
Of expert or of trained detective,
To find out what it was that made
The British Army ineffective.
It has been proved before, you see,
By more than one good politician,
That troops, to win the day, must be
In perfect physical condition.
For instance, I should quickly go
And hide behind the nearest nummock,
If I were made to face the foe
And fight upon an empty .
When round the soldier cannons roar,
And bullets ping on every side, he
Is apt to realise that war
Can make one dreadfully untidy.
And if he gets, by way of change,
A hand to hand exciting scuffle,
His clothes he 's sure to disarrange,
His hair he '11 very likely ruffle.
But now, if such should be the case,
No longer need he be down-hearted;
Wheno'er there comes a breathing space
His hair can once again be parted.
Then onward boldly he will rush;
His locks are smooth, and he, of
course, is
Quite eager for another " brush"
(This tima with the opposing forces).
In days to come it will be seen
We may have some department that '11
Provide bay-rum and brilliantine
For use upon the field of battle.
So, while 'mid storm of shot and shell
Our soldiers give the foe a few fits,
For alJ that lookers-on could tell,
They might have just come out of
TRUEFITT'S.
MERCIFUL ESCAPES.
IN a recent account of election pro-
ceedings, in which a candidate was
pelted with dirt, mud thrown in the
face of his wife, and his daughter struck
with a stick, a daily paper remarked
that "the police had difficulty in pre-
venting _a breach of the peace." A
correspondent sends a brief account of
various other episodes, in each of which,
by an equally narrow margin, a contre-
temps was similarly avoided :—
The extensive premises of Messrs.
BLANK & Co., oil and tallow merchants,
were completely gutted by fire last
night, all five stories being ablaze at
once. It needed all the efforts of the
local brigade to forestall what promised
to be a conflagration.

THE NEW PLAY.
Low Comedian. "HAVE YOU SEEN THE NOTICE?"
Tragedian. "No; 13 IT A OOOD ONE?"
Low Comedian. "IT 's A FORTNIGHT'S."
A motor-car, proceeding along the
High Street the other evening, took
fright, it is supposed, at a constable on
point-to-point duty, and exploded,
blowing the occupants in various direc-
tions over the adjoining buildings. The
policeman is to be congratulated upon
averting what might have been a serious
accident.
The whole of the carnivora confined
(until Wednesday last) in Barnwell's
Menagerie simultaneously escaped from
their cages on the date in question, and
invaded the space usually reserved for
the patrons of the show. A great many
of the latter were present, and were
caused considerable annoyance. It is
said that the turnstiles at the gates
were literally hidden beneath more or
less fragmentary articles of clothing left
by the audience in making its exit.
The authorities had no easy task in
staving off a veritable eauve qui pent.

LYRICS OF LABOUR.
EXAMPLE is very catching. The
success of P. C. MITCHELL'S little book of
poems, Ballads in Blue (not published
by CONSTABLE), a copy of which was
accepted by the KING, has set many
another honest fellow a-rhyming. P.C.
GEORGE MITCIIELL, 150 G, writes of his
volume :—
"The work was done most on his feet,
At evening hour when on his beat,
When voices from high heaven
Would call to him to contemplate,
To study and to meditate,
And use the gift thus given."
This is an age of competition, and
the Islington policeman's rivals are on
him like a motor-car. Copies of Ballads
in Grey, White, Green, Black and Check
lie before us, another instance of the
jnterprise of the publishing business in
spite of a bookbinders' strike.
Ballads in Grey is by Mr. JEMMY
DRACK, of Pentonville. One at least of
iis poems seems to bear upon P. C.
MITCHELL'S muse :—
["he only comfortable beats
?or burglar-men in London streets,
Is where the slop 's a poet.
<\>r when they 're trasy copping rhymes
)ne has a chance of busy times—
And off before they know it.
Ballads in White cometh up like
a flower from a Battersea baker, Mr.
ALFRED BUXN. We quote one of its many
pleasing verses :—
I never extricate a batch
But what some elegy I hatch,
Some lyric of delight.
So that each loaf that leaves my home
Becomes a veritable pome
To all that read aright.
Not to be outdone, Mr. HEXERY SPROUTS,
of Tooting, comes up smiling with
Ballads in Green. Perhaps the most
characteristic and succulent stanza is
this:—
As parsnips from the soil I tug,
Poetic fancies fill my trug;
And when I 've done my supper beer
I sets 'em down just like this here;
And to prevent domestic strife
I shouts 'em to my doting wife.
We have also received from Mr. JABKZ
BERRYMAJT, of Gravesend, a little sable
volume entitled Ballads in Black, from
which we quote a passage :—
I never look upon a hearse
But as a subject of all verse,
And whensoe'er I see a mute
I gets a grip upon my lute.
Mr. ATTILA HARRIS, of Savile Row,
who sends us Ballads in Check, is a
more dexterous manipulator of the pen
than any of his rivals. He writes a
charming poem, "Sunset on the
Tweeds":—
Think not because, in durance vile,
Behind the counter by the mile
I measure out material,
My simple soul is not possessed
By thoughts of Araby the Blest,
By ecstasies ethereal.
No, though the humble tailor's goose
May not invariably produce
Songs of the highest order;
Each length of Tweed I cut inspires
My bosom with romantic fires,
And visions of the Border.
"An Unexceptionable Reference."
Mr. Punch, who is "not for an age
but for any time," being reminded of
the fact by history repeating itself just
at this moment, and so closely too, anent
the Education Bill, begs to draw public
attention to his Cartoon for April 23,
1853, entitled, " Who shall Educate? or,
Our Babes in the Wood."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FBOM THE DIAKT OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Nov. 10.
—House with pleasure finds in Birth-
day Honours List the names of two of
its oldest and most esteemed Members.
A. H. BROWN is what the late Claimant
spoke of as B.B.K., meaning Baronet of
the United Kingdom. GEORGE CHRIS-
TOPHER TROUT BARTLEY is Knight Com-
mander of the Order of the Bath.
If it were possible to associate Sir
ALEXANDER BROWN, Bart., M.P., with
anything approaching old age, it might
be said that (being of course a married
man), he approaches the status of Father
of the House. HICKS-BEACH, who holds
that honourable position—and has by
the way run away from his sorrowing
brood—took his seat only four years
before the Shropshire Member. Man
and boy the new Baronet has sat in the
House for thirty-four years, and is still
more boy than man. All comes of
military training. Born and brought
up amid commercial associations, he
sighed for the tented field, the clash of
arms. Entering the Army he, before
retiring on his laurels, fought his way
to the rank of Cornet in the 5th Dragoon
Guards.
One sees to this day the effect of early

"Cornet Brown."
(Sir A. H. Br-wn, Bart.)

"SiR TROUT" B-RTL-Y, K.C.B.
training; the spruce, upright figure,
the martial step; one hears the ringing
voice of command with which he
remarks by way of preface to his speech,
"Mr. SPEAKER, Sir •"
Just before they went out to the war,
BOBS and KITCHENER looked in at House
of Commons. Seated in Peers' Gallery,
they observed a martial figure in full view
below Gangway on Ministerial side.
"It's aS very well, KITCHENER," said
BOBS, "to be pleased with our little
advancement. Tell you what, if CORNET
BROWN had stuck to his guns, you and
I wouldn't have had a look in."
KITCHENER, a man of few words, said
nothing. SARK, who relates the little
episode, tells me he thought the more.
CORNET BROWN, his helmet long a hive
for bees, has been content to live with
us in the House of Commons, winning
the esteem and regard of more than one
generation of Members.
In his way, and naturally there is
about him less of the clang of spurs,
Sir TROUT BARTLEY, K.C.B., has in equal
measure gained the esteem of the critical
Assembly in which he has sat for seven-
teen years. Time was when he heard
the chimes at midnight with CORPORAL
HANBURY and CAP'EN TOMMY BOWLES.
When opportunity for promotion came,
and, after the manner of Ministers,
malcontents were looked up, of the new
Fourth Party one was taken and two
were left. CORPORAL HANBURY received
his commission. Now the blameless
BARTLEY is Sir TROUT, and to-night CAP'EN
TOMMY, ashore in the backwater, puts
a pistol to the head of PRINCE ARTHUR
and demands instant reply to the
question "Whether His Majesty's
Ministers are responsible for the grant
of Peerages and Baronetcies, and the
distribution of Orders and other honorary
distinctions."
Always been about Sir TROUT a cer-
tain rugged independence that pleased
the House. Making no attempt at ora-
tory he has a way of putting his finger
on the weak link in a'chain of argu-
ment embarrassing to the adversary.
Few more effective debaters, especially
in business-like atmosphere of Com-
mittee.
Observe I fall into habit of referring
to our new K.C.B. by his third
Christian name. No authority for the
preference; but trust it may be con-
firmed. Sir GEORGES are common
enough, and we already have Sir
CHRISTOPHER FURNESS. Sir TROUT stands
alone, pleasantly suggestive of being
followed in due course at the festive
board by Sir Loin.
Business done.—Indian Budget ex-
pounded.
Tuesday night.—" May 'you never,
dear TOBY, know how sharper than a
serpent's tooth it is to have the SPEAKER
getting up every other minute inter-
rupting a carefully prepared oration."
Thus HARRY CHAPLIN, mopping mas-
sive brow with Brobdingnagian handker-
chief. Case truly hard. H. C. differing
from his right hon. friend PRINCE ARTHUR,
on subject of closure by compartments,
resolved to speak and vote against it.
Rare opportunity of showing young
things new to the present Parliament
the sort of discourse based on high
Constitutional grounds that used to be
the thing when DIZZY was in his prime,
and the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD was writing
letters to the Times over the signature
"Historicus." Devoted some days and
nights to production of masterpiece
worthy of occasion. His position in
debate fitly recognised by a call to
follow Leader of Opposition, who had
succeeded to speech of PRIME MINISTER.

that scores rose to their feet and, being
in standing attitude, walked out of the
House. Got along very well to begin
with. Referring to judgment given in
particular case by Mr. SPEAKER PEEL,
H. C., with generous air of patronage,
expressed the belief that Lord PEEL'S
successor would be equally true to the
principles of the Constitution. Turning
over his folios in search of next
point equally good, was startled by loud
cry of "Order!" Looking up, dis-
covered SPEAKER on his legs. At first
indisposed to give way. More yells of
"Order!" from Radicals opposite.
Slowly resuming his seat, heard SPEAKER
roundly rate him for presuming to
dictate to the Chair what course it
should take.
Gasping for breath, H. C. protested
that nothing was further from his mind
than the conduct denounced. Went on
again; alluded to O'DoNNELL the other
night dashing across House "to assault
PRIME MINISTER." TIM HEALY, jealous
for the already undermined character of
a fellow-countryman who had actually
hit nobody, appealed to SPEAKER to say
if that was a fair description of what
took place.
Once more H. C., pink of politeness,
apologised. There was, however, one
matter on which at least he was safe.
No one could deny that JOHN DILLON
had called the COLONIAL SECRETARY a liar.
"I think," remarked H. C., regarding
his audience through triumphant eye-
glass, "lam at least accurate in that
assertion."
"Order! order!" cried the SPEAKER;
"the right hon. gentleman is wandering
far from the question before the
House."
Members regarding the abject, liter-
ally limp condition into which H. C.
was by this time reduced, cruelly
laughed, and the great constitutional
authority, fallen on evil days, folded his
tent (represented by the pocket-handker-
chief aforesaid) like the Arab, and as
silently stole away.
Business done.—Wholesale closure for
Education Bill approved.
Friday night.—Deeply regret to learn
of fresh dissension on Front Opposition
Bench. It is adorned and strengthened
by the presence of two able, serious,
middle-aged young men who have done
the State service, one at the Foreign
Office, the other at the Colonial. What
they have fallen out about is not war
or peace, or the Education Bill. It is
fly-fishing. EDWARD GREY is the author
of a learned work, in which he insists
that the proper way to land a fish is to
hold the rod in the right, the landing
net in the left hand. Mr. MURRAY this
week publishes a treatise on Fishing
and Shooting, by SYDNEY BCXTON, in
which he takes precisely opposite
views; insists that the operations of
paying out, reeling in, and the handling
of the net are more delicate manipula-
tions than the work of simply managing
the rod, and should therefore be en-
trusted to the right hand. The matter
being referred to the arbitrament of the
Leader of the Opposition, he suggested
as a compromise that, if the fish would
only kindly wait, the right and left
hand might be alternately employed.
This little schism is the only draw-
back to the^ pleasure of a book which,
written by an expert, will be most
enjoyed by i those who know how to
handle gun" and rod, and will make
those who don't wish they did. SYDNEY
BCXTON is equally at home with either.
To personal experience by stream and
moor he adds in this work the genial
glow of research through elder times.
The value and interest of the book are
added to by the introduction of old and
rare prints. More particularly in respect
of shooting, they recall the simpler
manners of our ancestors, with their
flint guns built by MANTON, their mole-
skin or cord trousers, their blue or
green coats, their stiff hats, their stocks

The great successor to \V. E. Forster.
(Mr. W-nkl-n.)
and their shoes, their shot belts and
their powder flasks.
Business done. — Getting on with
Education Bill like house on fire.
"I COULD never see," observed Mr.
MUDDLEHEAD, thoughtfully, "why it was
always considered as expressing the
performance of a brave and daring act
to 'beard the oyster in his shell.' I
have frequently done it, and "—he added
triumphantly—"swallowed the oyster
afterwards."

Impudent Incroyable (at Covent Garden Bal Masque). "I SAY, MB.
SPANISH INQUISITION, WHAT PRICE YOUB COSTUME WHEN YOU 'VE FINISHED
WITH IT? COME IN SPLENDIDLY FOE MY MOTOR-CAR, YOU KNOW."
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch (HooDER AND STOUGHTON)
is a touching story, simply told, of the struggles of a brave-
hearted woman, mother of a forlorn family. Cabbage Patch
does not appear to have even been able to grow a single cab-
bage. A queer neighbourhood situated in an American town,
ramshackle cottages play hopscotch over its railroad track.
There being no streets, when a new house was built the
owner faced it in any direction fancy prompted. Here
existed Mrs. Wiggs, the late Mr. Wiggs having in a state of
chronic intoxication stumbled into eternity. Her two boys
were named respectively Billy and Jim. Her three girls
severally received at the baptismal font the names of Asia,
Australia and Europena. Amid the squalor and the
daily struggle for bread Mrs. Wiggs seldom loses courage.
The philosophy of her life is summed up in her casual
remark, "It ain't never no use puttin' up yer umbrelT till
it rains." My Baronite reading with delight Miss ALICE
CALDWELL HEGAN'S little book finds anew how nearly kin are
pathos and humour, tears and laughter.
The ladies' heads that Mr. CHARLES DANA GIBSON draws in
his Social Ladder (London: JOHN LANE) would alone suffice
to render this collection of his drawings popular. In respect
to the noddles of his models, he is a perfect Blue Beard, who
was a master in the art of taking off ladies' heads. Not a
few of Mr. DANA'S drawings are exceptionally humorous.
His ladies are for the most part uncommonly fine specimens of
"linked sweetness long drawn out; " and aa to his men they
are "sons of ANAK " whom he has a knack of reproducing.
In Peggy and Gill (SIMPKIN, MARSHALL), another pictorial
Christmas book, evidently after the model of Alice (who has
much to answer for), the illustrations by clever Miss DOROTHY
FURNISS are by chalks, or rather by pencil, a long way the
best part of Mr. ASHTON'S book.
The Baron welcomes Mr. Punch's Book for Children,
written in a delightfully nonsensical and irresponsible style,
and capitally illustrated, by Mr. CHARLES PEARS, author and
artist. The Baron, in full uniform, after inspecting the
lines, salutes the artist's colours, and compliments him on
having produced one of the very best and brightest of
Christmas books. All the mgre pleased is he to give this
testimony, seeing that Mr. PEARS is one of Mr. Punch's Own
Militia, not a Regular, and that this book is brought out by
Messrs. BRADBURY AND AONEW, whom he congratulates on
something "genuinely Christmassy," its style and get-up
being neither affectedly old-fashioned nor ostentatiously
new-fangled; just, in fact, the very thing to please everylxxly,
which, as nobody knows better than everybody, is about
the most difficult thing in the world to accomplish. If all
good children are to have their desserts, then here is plenty
of Pears for them, and let 'em " live 'applely ever after."
In A Roman Mystery (METHUEN & Co.) Mr. RICHARD BAGOT
gives us a good pennyworth of sensation to an intolerable
amount of prattle about Italian politics, a knowledge of
which the author seems to have mastered on the plan
adopted by the eminent authority in Pickwick who wrote
an elaborate essay on "Chinese Metaphysics" by looking
up in the Encyclopaedia all that came under the head of
China, and all that came under Metaphysics, and then
"combining the information." Of course our friend the
Skipper can be called in, but one doesn't take up a novel
by Mr. BAGOT for this sort of exercise.
To Messrs. MACMILLAN comes the happy thoxight of
presenting to the present generation some of the books
whose names it knows but lacks opportunity of reading.
Illustrated Pocket Classics is perhaps the not very happy title
of an enterprise tliat has no other blemish. The series
includes Mrs. GASKELL'S Cranford, with preface by Mrs.
RITCHIE, who also introduces Miss MITFORD'S Our Village to
an England full of towns. Mr. AUSTIN DOBSON presents
The Vicar of Wake field, and prefaces the JANE AUSTEN
masterpieces, delight of MACAULAY. My Baronite would like
to know how far the great critic and bookman's verdict is
accepted by a public which delights in MARIE CAINE and HALL
CORELLI. The little volumes, beautifully printed, daintily
illustrated by HUGH THOMPSON and CHARLES BROCK, and issued
at a modest price, form of themselves a priceless library.
To a majority the simple Gladstonian postcard is as
objectionable as "an open letter." Therefore it is not with-
out a certain feeling of gratification that the Baron recog-
nises in the "I^tterettes" of Messrs. WALKER & Co. an
attempt at helping to facilitate brevity in correspondence.
These "Letterettes" are described by them as "Handy.f
Stylish! Economical!" Now if anything could have set
the Baron against this invention it would have been this
same styling them "stylish!" "Economical" is another
matter where time is money. BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.
Note.—In briefly reviewing The Intrusions of Peggy last
week my Baronite drew a comparison between Peggy Ryle
and "Trilby or Mimette." But Mimette is a Mrs. HARRIS;
"there ain't no sech a person." The word originally written
was "Musette," which, after being corrected to "Mimi"
but, unfortunately, with the "ette" unerased, reappeared as
"Mimette." A combination-word suggestive of MURGER'S
two single heroines rolled into one.

VARIETY IS CHARMING.
LORD MAYOR'S DAY falling on a Sunday hurt itself so badly
that the festival had to be postponed till Monday the 10th,
and if on that evening the Mansion House was as crowded
as was the Pavilion, it must have been full indeed. Be-
tween the two entertainments—that at the Munching House
and "the Pav."—it would be unfair to the former to
institute any comparison, though, were Mr. DANIEL LENO
elected by universal consent (as of course, could it be put to
the vote, he would be) Lord Mayor of London, the Mansion
House would have to be enlarged in order to accommodate
the guests that would flock to the banquet to hear His
Lordship's speech on things in general and nothing in par-
ticular, interspersed with a " refrain " occasionally recurring.
A mayor is a person of considerable consequence, but DAN
LENO is a personage of the greatest In-consequence. He
comes on to tell you how he went with JONES to the Races,
and he gives you several family histories and a variety of
family portraits, .ill in due race-course, and brings you safe
home, although you had been like to "die o' laughin'"
on the road. Then, after a brief interval, kindly allowed in
order that the audience may mend their split sides, he
returns in such a nondescript costume that, as you regard
this " little star," you can't help saying to yourself, "How I
wonder what you are!" but before an answer can be given
DANIEL has announced that he has re-appeared to give an
imitation of a Robin Redbreast, which he forgets to do until
he has wandered through half a hundred various topics,
treating them all in his own utterly inimitable and inap-
proachable style, pausing, after all these flights of fancy,
for itist one second to " give it to the bird," and then per-
forms the final feat (in which no imitator can come anywhere
near him) of taking himself off.
"Laughter holding both her sides!" Why the very walls
crack with liilarity, and even the eccentric comedian can
hardly hear himself speak, so hilarious is the audience.
So occupied have we been with this eccentric Professor of
Inconsequence, that little space is left to tell how good is
the entire entertainment, including Lux's Performing Dogs,
a talented troupe, exceptionally light-hearted; Mr. GEORGE
RODEY, immensely funny as Oliver Cromipell, with his
mixture of twentieth century topics, seventeenth century
allusions, and fourteenth century expressions; fascinating
Miss IDA RENE, with her song more " serio" than " comic,"
reminding us of YVETTE GUILBERT, and all the other amusing
"turns" in an entertainment whereof the motto is "one
good turn deserves another." The "Pav." is the very
place for a Lord Mayor's night, commemorating WHIT-
TINGTON, who, following the advice of the chimes " to turn
again," did his "turn" so effectually as to be three times
the King of the City east of Temple Bar. The motto of
the music-hall must always be "Everything by turns and
nothing long." Vivat Lena!

CHARIVARIA.
ALTHOUGH theKAiSERbrought over with
him the tallest officer in the German
army, we are glad to say that Lord
LwracowNE made it clear to him that we
are not to be frightened into concessions.
It is generally felt that Sir EDWARD
GREY might have chosen another time
for declaring our "foreign relations"
were not satisfactory.
Meanwhile we fear the EMPEROR is in
a fair way to forfeit American respect.
He is said to have refused an offer to
appear on the stage of a first-class
Music-Hall as a Quick Change Artist.
And this in spite of the fact that the
terms mentioned were the highest that
have ever been offered to a monarch by
a Music Hall.
There are certain papers which, while
never backward in finding fault with
our Navy, always fail to bestow praise
where praise has been earned. Mr. Punch
is not one of these, and would draw
attention to the fact that the EMPEROR
was escorted to England by six of our
torpedo boat-destroyers, not one of
which destroyed another, or even itself.
Let us hope we shall be able to surprise
an enemy as completely in time of
war!
By the by, those who say that our
seamen are ill fed may be interested to
hear that some of the French ships in
the Mediterranean have skeleton crews
on board.
It has been discovered that in the
poorer parts of Sydney horseflesh is
being disposed of as butcher's meat.
When there was a demand for re-mounts
this was not so. _
The Bourse Gazette of St. Petersburg
is desirous of promoting better relations
between Russia and England, and has
put forward the following suggestion :—
"Would it not be better to recognise
once and for all that in Afghanistan, as
in Persia, China, and throughout Asia,
Russia has legitimate interests which
threaten nobody? It would be enough
for the British to adopt this simple
point of view in order that the many
questions which give them nightmare
might vanish—such as the regulating
ot the Russo-Afghan frontier relations,
and the establishment of a Russian
representative in Kabul." Mr. Punch is
always pleased to welcome a humorous
rival.
A Coronation Dinner was eaten last
week by the male inhabitants of Brun-
dall, Norfolk. It was cold.

GOING TO THE POLL.

N.B.—One of Hie supporters of the rival candidate has been busy wltft Hie placards

Considerable irritation • has been
caused in Gurney Street, Newington,
by what is looked upon as a miscarriage
of justice. A sentence of two months'
imprisonment has been passed on a
tenant for throwing a landlord down-
stairs, although the provocation came
from the landlord. He had asked for
his rent.
An exhibition of dogs trained for war
has been held at Frankfort. One dog
was created a Sergeant in the German
Army, and a General in the British
Army.
The Government is ordering several
thousand harrows for Boer farmers. It
is said that the Daily News is delighted
at the prospect of describing "More
Harrowing Scenes in the Transvaal."
The bulk of the Irish Members con-
tinue to stay away from the House of
Commons, and Ireland is now less likely
than ever to get Home Rule, as the
ennui due to their absence from West-
minster is described as almost intoler-
able.
The great feature of the Lord Mayor's
Show this year consisted in seven cars
emblematic of the Decay of Pageantry
in England.
Quite one of the prettiest decorations
on the route was, we hear, to be seen in
Petticoat Lane. It took the form of the
word "WELCOME," cleverly arranged
out of the legs of second-hand trousers.
A Corner in Waste Paper.
A CONTEMPORARY speaks of a person
who was arrested the other day at
Plymouth charged with "having in his
possession forged Bank notes worth
£40,000." One trembles to think
what they would have been worth if
they had not been forged.

LES DEUX ROIS.
LE MYSTERE DE WINSOR. REVELATION
COMPLETE.
Du moment qu'un roi voyage quelque
part, ou s'occupe de quelque chose, nous
autres journalistes franeais, c'est a dire
lea mieux renseign^s comme moi, nous
llainms un complot honteux. On a
beau dire qu'il s'amuse a la chasse,
qu'il passe une huitaine de jours chez
des parents, en effet qu'il s'amuse/nous
nous moquons de tout c;a, nous cherchons
la verite, et nous la trouvons toujours.
Ces derniers jours le roi de PORTUGAL
est al!6 a Winsor chez le roi d'ANGLE-
TERRE. Deux rois qui se rencontrent! On
voit immecliatement une belle occasion
de flairer quelque chose. Les infames
joumaux d outre Manche, subventionne's
par 1'ignoble gouvernement anglais,
nous ont racont6 un tas de petites
histoires de chasses, de tours du pro-
prietaire, de visiles aux ^curies, au
pare, comme si les deux rois n'e'taient
que de simples countrys gentleman*.
Mais moi, HENRI THOPFORT, je ne me
laisse jamais tromper par les mensonges
des journalistes, etant journaliste moi-
meme. Done j 'ai penetr^ le mystere de
Winsor. C'est on ne peut plus simple.
La perfide Albion cherche toujours
la domination universelle. Done elle
desire le Portugal et toutes ses colonies.
Elle est enorm&nent riche; elle peut
offrir des milliards de livres sterling.
Mais, en meme temps, elle est avare.
C'est un pays de negotiants, le plus
grand et le plus infame syndicat du
monde. Done elle offre le moins pos-
sible.
II y a quelques mois le roi d'ANGLE-
TERRE est alI6 visiter 1'De de Man.
Pourquoi? Je vais vous expliquer tout
ea. D'abord le nom veut dire 1'He de
rHomme. Qui est cet homme? C'est
un certain Earl CAINE, proprietaire de
1'ile, qui a re?u le roi d ANOLETERRE en
ami et allied Ce Comte CAINE est non
seulement prince de Man, ou il possede
un chateau si £norme qu'on 1'appelle
"Caatletown "—ville du chateau—mais
il est aussi tres renomme comme littera-
teur. C'est lui qui a ecrit Marie Corelll,
et plusieurs autres romans. Et oil est-il
dans ce moment? Le malheureux
Comte, priv6 de sa principaute et chasse
de ses terres, a langui pendant des mois
dans la "Maison des Clefs," prison
publique de 1'ile. Enfin il a pu s'evader,
et se refugier au sein de k grande
Re'publique de 1'Ouest. II demeure a
present, en souverain exile\ aux Etats
Unis. Et les Anglais, ayant saisi son
territoire, echangera 1'De de Man contre
le Royaume de Portugal et toutes ses
colonies.
Voyez-vous, c'est tout ce qu'il y a de
plus simple. Ca saute aux yeux. Mais

Sill. "'ULLO, SALLY, com' TO THE THEAYTER?"
Sally (who is waring her big sister's hat). "'COURSE I AIN'T."
Bill. "Ho, I THOBT P'RAPS YOU wos, FROM YER MATISAY 'AT!"
je suis seul a flairer la vraie explication
du mystere de Winsor! Le Due de
LANSDONN, Ministre des Affaires Etran-
geres, et le Marquis de SOVERAL, Ministre
portugais, ont assist^ aux "chasses"
selon les abominables et mensongers
journaux londoniens.
Non seulement ca. Le roi d'ANGLE-
TERRE a tenu ouvertement un conseil.
Pourquoi? Evidemment pour arranger
1'echange. Et un seul ministre est
venu de Londres. Lequel? Non pas
BALLFORE, qui est uniquement occupe de
son projet d'e'ducation, pour enseigner
1'ignoble jeu de "golfe" aux innocents
enfantsd'nonnetes"noneomefore7nis£e8."
Lequel, alors? le Due de DEWONSHIR.
Naturellement. n dort toujours, et par
consequent il n'entend rien. A la fin
du conseil on 1'eVeille, il signifie son
adhesion au proces-verbal de la seance
en criant ''Hip, hip, Jiourra!" & la
mode anglaise, et tout est fini.
Vous allez voir bientot si j'ai raison.
Ou le roi de Portugal ira a File de Man,
ou il n'y ira pas. S'il y va, c'est qu'il
la poss^dera ouvertement. S'il n'y va
pas, c'est qu'il la possedera secretempnt.
Ainsi dans aucun cas je suis sur de ne
pas me tromper. D'ailleurs je ne me
trompe jamais.
Et notre miserable gouvernement ne
s'en occupe point. L'ignoble LOUBET,
1'infame COMBES, 1'execrable PELIJITAN,
qu'est-ce qu'ils font? Hs ne font rien!

"HOME-THOUGHTS FROM THE SEA."
[Being an intelligent anticipation of certain spasms of emotion likely
to occur on H.M.S. Good Hope, southward bound, in Lat. 37° 16', the
region, broadly speaking, where this kind of outburst has become a
hallowed tradition. Consult the works of Messrs. ROBERT BBOWNING,
HENBT NEWBOLT, &c.~\
ALOOF upon the silent prow
His lonely watch he kept;
Across the night from left to right
The constellations crept;
Lashed to his larboard button-hole
A withered orchid slept.
His civil retinue had passed
Each to his cabin'd crib;
As on she strained the vessel sprained
From time to time a rib;
A little more of this, and she
Would be inclined to Gib.
What is it sets the old sea-dog
A-prowling to and fro?
Say, does he muse of the boilers' flues
About to burst below,
And roughly reckon whereabouts
His fractured frame will go!
Or is it some less poignant theme
That holds his thought in fee—
As how to tell the safest spell
For keeping cigars at sea?
Or why the deep and men's insides
Are apt to disagree?
Does Biscay's memory, strangely green,
Obsess him even now?
Can that be why with pensive eye
He promenades the prow,
Letting the night-wind play upon
His rudely furrowed brow?
Or does the neighbourhood recall
His flag's historic star—
The bloody fray in Vigo Bay,
The rout of Trafalgar,
And other local feats that went
To make us what we are?
Does he rehearse that heavy task
The future has in store?
Does he devise some rich surprise
To stagger Afric's shore?
Or deem DE WET has spoilt his pitch
By going on before?
0 no! On other flights than these
His winged fancies fleet;
They double back along his track
To where the Commons meet;
And he wonders whether the Cabinet
Remarks his vacant seat!
And as a mother yearns to keep
Her wavward boy in sight,
Nursing the fear that he may sheer
Off from the path of right",
He asks of the unresponsive seas,
Where is that Bill to-night?

"UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS."
Old Nursery Rhyme.
IN Lyre and Lancet, the amusing comedy in two Acts by
F. AN.STEY and F. KINSEY PEILE, recently brought out at the
Royalty Theatre, there are twenty-six genuinely distinct
"characters," and every one of them with something to
say and do essential to the action of the play, which is
simply a "Comedy of Errors." The incidents, however,
are purely farcical, as are those in She Stoops to Conquer,
Tlie Hundred Pound Note, or The Clandestine Marriage,
which are all on the borderland between low comedy and
broad farce. The First Act goes with first a ripple and
then a roar of laughter, and the curtain is raised for Mr.
GEORGE GIDDENS, excellent as the Vet.; for Mr. COSMO STUART
as the Minor Poet, a clever rendering of an eccentric role;
for Miss TALBOT, Miss YOUNG, Miss HELEN FERRERS, Miss MABEL
BEARDSLEY, Mr. GERALD GCRNEY; Mr. FITZROY MORGAN, uncom-
monly good as the empty-headed, sporting, practical-joke-
player; and for Mr. WYES, inimitable as Tredwell the Butler
at Wyvern Court, who must be an elder brother of that other
Butler who is now the hero of The Admirable Crichton. A
study in stage Butlers would be instructive.
In the Second Act, which goes along briskly, though not
quite up to the high-pressure of the First, Miss WOOLGAR
MELLON gives a sharp sketch of a scullery-maid that
might be twin sister to Miss PATTIE BROWNE'S highly
coloured Tweeny at the Duke of York's; Miss DOROTHY
CHESTER, Miss SOPHIE LONGWOOD, and Miss S. FRANCIS distin-
guish themselves as the "three little maids," not "from
school," but quite at home in The Servants' Hall at Wyvern,
where perfect Mrs. Pomfret (Miss KATHARINE STEWABT), the
Housekeeper, reigns supreme. Master VANE, as the Steward's
Room Boy, is capital, but the gem of this High Life Below-
stairs scene is the stud-groom Adams, as rendered by
Mr. LITTLEDALE POWER. Only why that straw perpetually in
his mouth? Is it "the last straw" which, as proverbially
fatal to an animal, he prefers to keep in his own possession?
But surely there are no camels in the Wyvern stable?
AH are good, whether in First or Second Act, and a more
effective finish, with the country dance and dialogue in verse
to suit the music, a situation most ingeniously arrived at by
the authors, could not possibly have been devised.
More than a word of praise is due to Mr. E. G. BANKS for
his cleverly arranged and very effective scene, " Tlie. Morning
Room at Wyvern Court," in Act I., as the Royalty stage is
on a very miniature scale for such a tableau.
CONCERNING GIFTS.
DAPHNE, ah! what present shall I bring,
As a pledge and token of my passion?
No vain trinket, necklace, brooch or ring—
After vulgar wooers' foolish fashion!
Gifts like those can never be the sign,
DAPHNE, of a love as strong as mine.
I would seek an offering—precious, rare,
Fraught with mystic magic, to betoken
Fragrant thoughts, intangible as air—
Hopes too full for words that can be spoken.
Such a gift I crave, wherewith to pay
Homage, DAPHNE, to your natal day.
So with scornful discontent I ban
Costly bauble—casket, gem or jewel—
While the Stores impatiently I scan
For an apter type of love's renewal;
Until in despair (each year the same)
I select—another photo-frame.

HI.—THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD.
N the high old Tory
Times, Dearly Be-
loved, the mena-
gerie at the Hotel
Cecil was greatly
excited by the go-
ings-on of a gay
and galumphing
young rogue Ele-
phant, who was
full of 'satiable impudence. He was
a source of secret but sempiternal
anxiety to his uncle the DOZY PACHY-
DERM until he retired into the Hatfield
Wild Woods; and he kept his foster-
brother, the ARTHABALF, on thorns, in
spite of the succulent and salubrious
affection that subsisted between them
(isn't "subsist" a nice word, Dearly
Beloved ?) But when it came to his
more distant relatives! He insulted

his great uncle the PLANTA GENISTA
JUMBO so much that he retired per-
manently to his fireside in the New
Forest. He abused his second cousins,
the Misses TABERXACK—Miss HENRIETTA
and Miss CAMILLA, you know—so dret-
fully that they fell ill of a twinsy and
had to be dosed with Epsom salts; and
he was so unkind to his sensitive
relative, Peer the Ploughman, that the
poor fellow had to be given a new
Chesterfield coat and a bunch of
Neapolitan violets. And still the
Elephant's child was full of 'satiable
impudence.
One fine morning in the middle of
the equinoctial session, when all the
Menagerie were eating Cabinet pudding
with Education sauce, together, the
young Elephant suddenly asked, "Where
do the Cape Gooseberries grow?"
Then everybody said in a loud and
unanimous chorus, "In South Africa,
stupid; why don't you go and sample
them yourself?"


"He insulted his great uncle the Planta Genista Jumbo so much that he retired
permanently to hia fireside in the New Forest."
So the Elephant's child immediately
took
23 Saratoga trunks;
10 Long spoons;
13 Squeezed sponges in hermetically
sealed sponge bags;
1 Aristocratic private secretary:
1 Man-of-War;
and a long farewell of Birmingham;
and said to his weeping colleagues,
"Good-bye, I am going on a wild Cape
Gooseberry chase to enlarge my mind
and examine my MILNER."
And they all cordially approved of
his plan and wished they were as lucky,
being very tired of Cabinet pudding
and Education sauce, and they gave
him a sumptuous and sonorous dinner
and went to see him off, crying, "Don't
come back too soon."
So off he sailed in the man-of-war to
Durban, and from Durban he went
to Bloemfontein, and from Bloemfontein
to Pretoria. And the first thing he
found at Pretoria was a highly educated
Balh'ol bi-lingual Rock Python in a state
of great suspensionist animation.
"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's
child in his politest Parliamentary
manner, "but have you seen such a
thing as a gigantic Cape gooseberry all
a-blowing and a-growing in these Pre-
torian regions?"
"Have I seen a Cape gooseberry?"
said the Rock Python, with an agonised
and academic inflection. "Great Mark-
ham's History, what will you ask me
next? Why, I see nothing else."
So the young Elephant said good-
bye to the bi-lingual Rock Python and
went on to Johannesburg, and there
the first tiling he heard was the groans
of a gay and gilded Crocodile, who was
concealed in a deep level, shedding
copious tears over his desolate and im-
pecunious condition.
"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's
child, in his most urbane accents, "but
do you happen to have seen a great
gooseberry in these penurious and
pestiferous parts?"
Then the Crocodile winked the other
eye, and said, "Come hither, little one,
why do you ask such things?"
"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's
child, "but I can't get any reliable
information at home, and my uncles
and aunts won't have anything to say
to me. So I came to look for myself
and forget Education sauce."
'Come hither," said the Crocodile,
"[for I am the proprietor of the goose-
berry you are looking for."
Then the Elephant's child incautiously
put his leg down into the deep level,
and the Crocodile caught him by the leg
and began to pull it with extreme per-
tinacity and power. Whereon the Ele-
phant's child was much annoyed, and

said, "Let go, you are pulling my leg
in the most audacious way. Your BEIT
is as bad as your bark."
Then the bi-lingual Balh'ol aristocratic
Rock Python uncoiled himself from an
adjacent pedestal and observed, "My
venerable but impulsive friend, if you
do not immediately extricate your nether
limb from the jaws of that vociferous
and voracious Helot, I feel pretty cer-
tain that, before you can. say J. B.
ROBINSON, he will elongate your slim
and elegant figure to such an extent
that your fond relatives will hardly
know you. And having done so,
perhaps you had better return to
your own orchidaceous preserves, and
ponder awhile upon the leg-pulling
capacities of these southern and Semitic
regions."
Whereupon the Elephant's child
whistled to his man-of-war, and hasten-
ing to his native haunts, resumed the
consumption of Cabinet pudding, accom-
panied however by less unpalatable
sauce than when he left. And that,
Dearly Beloved, is the true story of the
Great Mission.

"Let go! You are pulling my leg iu the most audacious way!"
THE RAVENS.
(After Mr. Seton Merriman.)
I.
Tm'four men had sat in silence for as
many hours. What their thoughts were,
who can say? Do we always know our
own? Of all the strange company that
the little room at the back of the bird-
stuffer's shop in Fenchurch Street had
seen, this was surely the strangest.
A man in a fur coat, with gold crowns
on his buttons, after the fashion of
Eastern Europe, was the first to speak.
"We are all agreed," he said in a cheer-
ful voice, through which vibrated a deep
melancholy—heaven help the country
whose men speak cheerfully in melan-
choly accents—"we are all agreed that
the hour has come?"
A man in a workman's blouse, whose
name had before now lighted the fires of
war through half a continent, assented
wearilv.
"We are ready," he said, as he made
a pyramid of bombs on the table, "if
the People will do their share. But one
can never be quite sure of the People,
mon ami. Yet wo have Isft as few points
unguarded as possible. It may be well
to go through our plans once more
before we separate."
The four men drew closer together
round the table, while their leader drew
a map of Europe from his pocket.
"Our object, as you know," he said,
"is to create a slight disturbance—
nothing that can be called criminal, and
nothing that can be attributed to the
work of secret societies. We have at
our disposal ten bombs," and he laid
his hand lightly on them. "One is to
be placed in the centre of the Newski
Prospect; another in the railway station
at Moscow; the students at the Univer-
sity have undertaken another; and I
have here a telegram from Father PETER,
of Odessa, promising to cherish another.
Prince ASTRAKHAN has made himself
responsible for one, and I sent reply-
postcards to the French, German and
Italian Brotherhoods asking a similar
favour. All, I am glad to say, are
willing to oblige us in this matter. We
will provide homes for the remaining
two among ourselves."
There was silence for some minutes
after he had finished speaking. There
was nothing to be said in criticism of
so simple and yet masterly a scheme.
From the adjoining shop came the
croak of a bird of prey. A slight pallor,
quickly erased, suffused the brow of the
chairman.
"A foolish association of ideas," he
said. "For the moment I thought it
must be one of the Ravens."
A keen, dark-eyed man with a
curiously sweet voice added the finish-
ing touch.
"And the bombs," he said simply,
"will be sent to the Army and Navy
Stores to be packed by skilled work-
men. They will be at Victoria Station
on Tuesday evening in time for the
night train to Dover."
And they all walked unostentatiously
out of the dingy shop into the roar of
the London traffic, as, in days gone by,
their ancestors had unostentatiously
mounted thrones—or scaffolds—in the
cause of Freedom.
(To be continued.)
A RAINBOW BATTERY.
DEAJJ MR. PUNCH,—The current Mail
Imparts the strangely moving tale
That, seeking what might best avail
To keep our troops un-spotted,
Some genius did, of late, devise
A Battery painted rainbow-wise,
Which beats the most attentive eyes,
Even when being trotted.
Sir, I perhaps need hardly say,
If a disguise so strangely gay
Conceals our guns in open day
And renders them immune, it's
The Public's right to have the plan
Tested as widely as we can—
All I would urge is, leave the man
Alone, and stick to Units.
Thus, having sealed a pattern shape,
You let the individual drape
His manly form, from foot to nape,
In any shade he fancies;
While, as for stuff, the varied tints
Would go with anything from prints
To cretonne, Harris tweeds, and chintz,
As fits the circumstances.
And when throughout the ranks you get
The bilious, florid, blonde, brunette,
Arrayed in uniform, and yet
In colours per complexion,
The total blend, of every hue
From Crimson Lake to Prussian Blue,
Should, if the papers tell us true,
Simply defy detection.
The Officer, tho' dressed to match,
Should have a huge, obtrusive patch
Of something stuck in rear, to catch
The eye that wants to find him;
By this a double debt you pay;
He simply has to " face " the fray :—
For if he turns to run away,
Think of the " mark " behind him!
As for recruits, I understand
Supply is far below demand;
But once let TOMMY'S form expand
In fancy-coloured suiting.
Why, obviously, there you are!
It would assuredly go far
To " make the army popular,"
And stimulate recruiting!
DuM-Dcif.

A LAMENT FROM THE LINKS.
[Mr. J. L. Low, the golfing expert, in a
recent article makes use of two new terms:
"dunch" (a peculiar digging stroke) and
"flub "—presumably the American for foozle.]
You ask what makes my cheek so wan,
What dims my lustrous eye,
Why I deliberately don.
An unbecoming tie?
Why when I saunter to my club
I sit alone and grunch?
My friend, it is the fatal flub,
It is the deadly dunch.
My waggle satisfaction gives,
My swing is free and fine,
No golfer boasts of expletives
A richer store than mine.
Yet do not for these reasons dub
Me happy, Mr. Punch,
For I 'm infected by the flub,
Distracted by the dunch.
In vain I seek the means to win
Remission of my ill:
I've tried sloe gin, phenacetin,
White port and salicyl.
I 've tried ammonia in my tub,
Hot water after lunch;
But man, alas! is born to flub,
Predestinate to dunch.
And yet, though desperately tried,
It mitigates my woes
To find my symptoms coincide
With Mr. JOHNNY Low's;
To learn that at the golfing hub
The pick of all the bunch
Are j ust as apt as I to flub,
And just as sure to dunch.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO GET ON.
No. IV.—IN SOCIETY.
I AM not responsible for the meaning usually attached to
e word "Society." I suppose, as a matter of fact, the
satirists invented it and the aspirers agreed to recognise it.
The former wanted something to lash. At that remote time
neither Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN on the one hand, nor, on the
other, Mr. HALL CAINE and Miss MARIE CORELLI, had been
born. All ingenuity therefore was diverted to creating a
monstrous agglomeration of brainless and chattering beings
to be called Society and to be taught by slings and arrows
» know its proper place at the tip-top of the social ladder.
Society, of course, not having a thought to spare never gave
one to the question. It just went on—you see I am now
assuming that it actually exists—fribbles inviting other
fribbles to dinners, theatre-parties, suppers, balls, Hurling-
tmm, receptions and the rest of the giddy round of pleasure,
snapping out their silly catch-phrases at one another, flying
off occasionally to Monte Carlo (it 'a called Monte for short),
eventually taking possession of the great game of Bridge and
puckering their foolish foreheads over its amazing intricacies,
and never doing a single hand's turn of decent honest work
in the whole course of their useless and preposterous lives.
But the aspirers had got what they wanted—an object for
their ambition, something that they could toil for and spin
for. The stupidity of the thing didn't affect them in the
least: all they cared to know was that it was at the top.
Having once assured themselves of that, they felt bound to
be of it and in it without any regard to consequences
Avaricious men of the aspiring class flung their money
about like water; stout matrons, whose days might have
been spent in comfort and their nights in sleep, plunged
into the whirlpool and grew as skittish as young minnows;
poor girls whom steady men of trade were pining to make
their mates, began to turn up their noses at anything under
a guardsman or a Foreign Office clerk, and fresh-looking
youngsters intended by destiny for careers of commerce or
Jaw, in which clothes count but little, devoted all the time
that they could spare from vapid flirtations and inane
evening parties to the selection of ties, coats and trousers
and waistcoats, and to the invention of collars and Society
slang.
Of course I know that there are people so lost to every
sense of decency as to hold all this is not necessarily Society
I myself used to think that we were all right up in Glen
Edward's Avenue. We were quite happy-—at least w(
thought we were. We paid our rent and our rates, anc
grumbled no more than was proper for good honest constitu
tional Conservatives. Our girls looked pretty in their
fal-lals, our boys went to their businesses and occupations
day in and day out, and our wives, bless their amp!
hearts, rated their cooks, suspected their butchers, and
brought up their families much as their mothers and grand
mothers had done before them. We had plenty of what we
then called society—it was in the days of our shining inno
cence—and we really enjoyed it. There were some agreeabl
rectors and vicars, a few amiable curates not above taking
their share in the little amusements of our circle, and quite
a sprinkling of gentlemen attached to journals, men wh
had either written articles that had been printed, or wer
thinking of writing them, and wondering who was to be
privileged to produce them. We had a statistician, a fellow
of the Geographical Society, and two fellows of the Zoologica
Society, who were very useful with Sunday tickets for th
children. London roared at our feet with its variou
theatres, and for the higher culture we had the literary an
artistic institutions of Hampstead, a region into which our
energies extended.
Then there was our Happy Evenings Society, with which
as incorporated the Book and Magazine Club. Wednesdays
•ere appointed for the happy evenings, that day of the
week having been chosen in deference to HOBSON, who had
n uncle in the House of Commons, and thought he might
ye able, as he expressed it, to bring the old buffer along
with him occasionally if we fixed Wednesday, which was
le evening off for M.P.'s in the ante-week-end period. The
Id buffer did come once, and held us all spell-bound on the
abject of out-door relief—but HOBSON never asked him again.
Ve took turns to meet, men and women, in one another's
rawing-rooms at 8.30 and stayed till 10, paying one another
ttle cheerful expected compliments, or listening to the girls
rhile they sang bits of ballads, and saying, "Thank you so
much. Who did you say composed that?" when the song
was finished. Sherry and cake were always on the table in
be dining-room, sometimes sandwiches, and often creams
nd jellies in wine-glasses; and the young fellows were
always very polite in offering their arms first to the matrons
nd taking them off for refreshments any time after 9.30.
Lnd when it was all over we put on our boots in the passage,
xipped our pumps into our overcoat pockets, and, having
xelped the ladies on with their cloaks and shawls, trudged
lome as merry and contented as we could be. Oh, yes,
hose were delightful days.
Of course the Book and Magazine Club wasn't what you
•ould call a hurrying concern—but you never had to wait
more than six weeks and might not have to wait more than
i fortnight for Cornhitt or Blackwood's, and you might
ye fairly sure of getting a biography or a book of travel—
we didn't bother about novels or poetry—within a year after
)ubli cation. We knew we were bound to get them some
jme or other, so we could afford to wait. And if anyone
asked us if we had read some celebrated book we didn't
lave to pretend we had: we replied "Not yet: let me see,
there 's the Vicar and HOBSON and Mrs. BODDINGTON before
I shall have it in six weeks from now," a fortnight
me. _
Deing the limit of time fixed for keeping any book. Of
course our etiquette was strict. We kept the rules about
calling and being called on in return, and we took off hats
n a very dignified way when we met a gentleman we knew
walking with a lady we didn't know. Altogether we were
very happy. But there came a serpent into our midst.

WITHIN my patriotic breast
My loyal spirit glowed;
It cried aloud to be expressed,
It clamoured for an ode;
It craved a living song to tell
Of country, King and Queen,
And, incidentally, to sell
My half-crown magazine.
My thoughts turned Putneywards: if he,
Who lulmined in the Times
Against the Boers, would write for me
Some adjectival rhymes
I called, but to receive regrets:
"Too busy. When you rang
I was selecting epithets
To hurl at ANDR-W L-NO."
Next R-DY-IID K-PL-NG I addressed,
And he replied: "I send
A patriotic piece—the best

The thirstiest here may drink his fill
Of patriotic pride."
I read it, but my spirit still
Remained unsatisfied.
Then A-ST-N tried his laureate hand:
The lion oped his jaws,
Stiffened his mane, as usual, and
Did something with his claws.
But though each anatomic part
So loyally behaved,
My yet more patriotic heart
Still fresh gymnastics craved.
The minor poets next I tried,
And slowly waded through
The hundred thousand odd supplied
By generous Who 's Who?
But even in his boldest flights
Not one had ever flown
Up to the aerated heights
In which I breathe alone.
So, finding Britain barren gound,
"I '11 go abroad," I thought,
And in the page of ARNDT I found
The very thing I sought.
Alas! that patriotic fire
And songs to suit the Free,
Like all things else which we require,

to local authorities and obtain their
solution.
Unwarned by this paralysing confes-
Louis SINCLAIR rushed in where
sion,

"Heaved a sigh of relief and withdrew."
(Mr. L-s S-ncl-r.)
CHARLES DILKE feared to tread. Had
drafted amendment to new clause.
When he rose to move it, discovered
his manuscript copy was a-missing.
"I am afraid, Mr. Chairman," he
said anxiously, "as I haven't got copy
of amendment with me I can't move it.
I lent it to an hon. Member, who has
not returned it." At this moment a
guilty figure crawled up and handed
piece of paper to SINCLAIR, who had
shown no sign of resuming his seat.
"All, here it is," he said.
Presently began to wish it hadn't
been there. As far as Committee could
make out he was impartially inclined to
make the proposed grant from the
Imperial Exchequer less or more.
Sometimes he said less, anon more.
ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S reply, enfeebled
by this uncertainty, further obscured
the issue. SINCLMR looked furtively
towards the door; murmured something
about "a meeting upstairs ;" LOWTHER,
as usual equal to emergency, threw a
burst of energy into the remark, "The
question is that the amendment be
withdrawn. The amendment by leave
withdrawn," he rapidly added.
SINCLAIR heaved a sigh, of relief, with-
drew, presumably to join meeting
upstairs. Certainly has not since been
seen, in Committee.
Business done.—New Finance Clause
Education Bill through Committee.
Tuesday night.—House learns with
provoking equanimity news flashed over
land and sea that DON'T KEIR HARDIK
has been arrested by the Brussels
police. Generally recognised that it
was the cap and comforter that did it.
Police in neighbourhood of Palace Yard
have grown accustomed to the eccentri-
city. For some who know their DICKENB
the worsted comforter brings pleasant
recollections of poor Trotty Veck going
down the slide with the boys at Christ-
mas-time, the ends of his comforter
flying in the crisp air.
Apart from cap and comforter, and a
little truculence about the tightness of
his trouser leg, the Member for Merthyr
Tydvil is the mildest-mannered man
that ever posed as leader of a mob.
His career a warning to ambitious
youth. He started on too lofty a note.
Never lived up to the brake in which,
regardless of expense, he came down to
take his seat in the Parliament elected
ten years ago. As the equipage drove
along the Embankment the hon. Mem-
ber and his escort were mistaken for
a company of beanfeasters, an illusion
strengthened by the frantic efforts of
the band. The new Member's heart's
desire was that, descending at the gate
of Westminster Hall, he should march
its full length to the entrance door of
the House, accompanied by his body-
guard, with trumpets also and shawms.

The police, utterly devoid of imagina-
tion, wouldn't even let the brake into
Palace Yard. Member for West Ham,
as he then was, had to approach House
in ordinary fashion, dependent for dis-
tinction entirely on tweed cap and the
legacy of Trotty Veck's comforter.
Really an amiable, kind-hearted,
gentle - mannered man, who wouldn't
kill a fly, much less a throned monarch,
DON'T KEIR HARDIE speedily succumbed
to the subtle, persistent influence of the
House, which in the end rounds off all
studied eccentricities, puts more or less
thin veneer of gentlemanhood on the
worst-bred manner. Once or twice in
early days HARDIE thrust his Don't Keir-
ness in the face of the House. Instead
of being terrified it smiled. By-and-by
the Socialist subsided. He furtively
put away his worsted comforter, and
one hot summer dqy presented himself
in a large silk necktie. It is true it
was blood-red in colour. That was a
detail quite as probably due to aesthetic
taste as to adherence to republican
principles.
Been so little to the fore of late,
Members almost forgotten he was one
of them. And now comes news that,
engaged in visiting capitals of Europe,
as if he were a deposed monarch or a
Boer General, the sapient Brussels police
descend upon him and arrest him on
suspicion of complicity in the attempt
to assassinate King LEOPOLD! Rarely
has the irony of fate taken so purely
comic a turn, anticipatory of Christmas
pantomime.
Business done.—Rattling off Educa-
tion Bill.
Friday night.—" And what do you
think of it?" DON JOSE asked, coming
upon me in the Library deep in The
Memoirs of Paul Kruger, which the
enterprise of FISHER UNWIN has secured
for English readers.
"I find it profoundly interesting," I
said. "Revelation of a notable man by
his own hand. The more interesting
since, slim to the last, he doesn't want
to tell you anything you don't know.
In the two volumes there are two
KRUGERS; the shrewd burgher and the
sly statesman. Of the two one prefers
the first, of whom there is something
frankly told. When he is writing of his
private life, especially its earlier tenn,
the narrative fascinates by its simplicity.
'My parents were simple farmers, and
I grew up at the farm like other farmers'
lads, looking after the herds and lending
a hand in the fields.' In very child-
hood was rooted what came to be the
dominating force in the old Boer's life
—hatred of the English. Out of the
dim ages of his infancy comes back to
the exiled President a cock-and-bull
story that his parents 'went on trek
because the English first sold the slaves,
and after they had got the money set
these slaves free again, and that the
money awarded in compensation was
made payable in England, practically
impayable to the Boer farmer.'
"From boyhood, through his prime,
KRUGER was always a fighting man;
would take on a tiger, a lion, or a diplo-
matic representative according as they
presented themselves. Once, discussing
differences arising between Transvaal
and Orange Free State, he proposed to
settle the matter by taking off his coat
and fighting a representative Free
Stater. Later in life, in conference in
London on the Convention of Pretoria,
the accuracy of one of his statements
was challenged by HERCULES ROBINSON.
'I,' he writes, 'jumped up quite pre-
pared to fall upon Sir HERCULES.'
"When, beyond these personal traits,

A Blend of S-m Ev-na and Sir W-ll-m H-rc-rt.
the student of history looks for light
on Transvaal affairs during the last five
years he is disappointed. The savage,
disappointed old man's visage is blurred
with hatred of all who cross his path.
CECIL RHODES was 'the curse of South
Africa; ' as for you," I reminded the
COLONIAL SECRETARY, "your 'complicity
in the Jamieson raid is established ;'
MILNER is ' the typical Jingo.' In the
earth beneath and the heavens above
there are only two reliable beings; one
is PAUL KRUGER, the other 'the Lord,'
whose name is dragged in on every
page with familiarity that shocks a less
unctuous person than Oom PAUL. When
the end became inevitable, the invoker
of the war fled into safety, 'constantly
sending telegrams to encourage the
burghers in the fight.' Yes: a deeply
interesting study of a rare personality.
What do you think of it?"
"I haven't read it," said DON JOSE".
"Been so busy, you know, preparing
to visit the country KRUGER has left.
Very odd that bit about him, bound for
the coast and a safe haven in Europe,
pulling up the train at convenient sta-
tions to send telegrams encouraging the
burghers in the fight. Heard some-
thing like it before:
He fled fall soon on the first of Jane,
And bade the rest keep fighting."

For acting the mischievous elf,
And daring to grin
At the Bills I brought in,
And sneer at my friends and myself!

And with smiling aplomb

And they said "He is sure to hit back.
He '11 get up and kill

As sure as his Christian name 's JACK!"
But, somehow, I strongly object
To doing what people expect;
And I've planned a surprise
That will open their eyes:
That Bill I intend to protect!
For I am a Man of the Law
Who likes his internal guffaw—
A finical, cynical,
Sit-on-a-pinnacle
Sort of a BERNARD SHAW!
When ARTHUR could claim my support,
Discretion was never my forte.
I delighted to speak
With my tongue in my cheek,
And to aid our opponents for sport!
But now that I 'm out of a berth,
And free to indulge in my mirth,
I feel myself forced
To continue a GORST—
And back him for all I am worth!
For I am a Man of the Law,
Who likes his internal guffaw—
A rallying, sallying,
Paradox-dallying
Kind of a BERNARD SHAW!

MR. PUNCH'S COMPRESSED DRAMAS.
m.—THE ETERNAL SILLY.
(Being a study in the everlasting futilities of melodrama.)
ACT I. SCENE—Deputy JSossm's lodging in Rome. TOMMASO,
a red-shirted Garibaldian, who looks rather like an
aged member of the Bootblacks Brigade, is discovered in
conversation with BRUNO Rooooo, Donna BOOMA's eccen-
tric assistant in sculpture.
Tommaso. BOSSBI'S very late to-night.
Bruno. He spent the afternoon in denouncing Donna
BOOMA under the Prime Minister's windows. The Prime
Minister is her guardian.
Tommaso. Not a very chivalrous proceeding.
Bruno. No. BOSSHI is one of Nature's gentlemen. It's
not a chivalrous type.
Tommaso. I doubt if GARIBALDI would have approved.
Bruno. Very likely. His methods are rather out of date
now-a-days.
Tommaso (sulkily). You say that now. But you '11 need
us veterans some day. As KIPIJNGHELLI sings :—•
TOMMASO questo, TOMMASO queUo,
Via, Via, TOMMASO!
[Exit crooning the rest of this popular ditty.
Bruno (grumbling). Tiresome old fool. Why doesn't he
sing " Linga Lunga LUCIA" instead of that balderdash!
Enter Deputy BOSSHI. He has a pallid face and long hair,
and looks rather like a cheap edition of a minor poet.
Bruno. Well, did you denounce her?
Bosshi. Oh, yes. It made quite a sensation. BEERBOHMELLI
had a party at his house, and I denounced her right under
his windows. His guests giggled like anything. It was an
interesting exhibition of ill-breeding.
Bruno. But what will your fellow Deputies think?
Bosshi. Think me rather a sweep, I suppose. (A Lady
in elaborate evening dress strolls into the room quite un-
announced) Donna BOOMA!
Donna Booma. You consider my turning up at your
lodgings shortly before midnight rather extraordinary?
Bosshi. That is certainly the impression I intended to
convey. Do Italian ladies of good position usually wander
about the streets of Rome at night in an opera cloak and a
diamond tiara?
Donna Booma. They do not. But these paltry conven-
tions do not apply to melodrama. I came in an opera cloak
because I wished to impress you with my loveliness. The
same explanation applies to the tiara.
Bosshi (puzzled). I don't think I quite follow.
Donna Booma. It's quite simple. This afternoon you
grossly insulted me. Naturally I at once felt an irresistible
craving to make your acquaintance.
Bosshi (politely). If you mean that what I said to-day was
untrue——•
Donna Booma. On the contrary. It was perfectly true.
And very pungently expressed. That's what attracted me
to you.
Bosshi (beioildered). My dear young lady, what you say
seems to me to make no sense at all. Either you are out of
your mind or I am.
Donna Booma. I expect it's I. I 'm a sculptor, you know.
An amateur sculptor. (BossHi shudders.) And that is
mentally very unsettling. With me it is peculiarly BO.
Whenever anyone insults me publicly I at once long to do a
bust of them. May I do a bust of you 9
Bosshi. Certainly, if you wish it. I seem to have done
you an injustice. I thought your moral character was
defective. I see it is only your intellect. You are evidently
crazy, and I shall be delighted if_you do a bust of me.

Tourist. "WHEN DOES THE NEXT TRAIN START FOE COKK, PORTEB?"
Irish Porter. "SHE 's JD8T GONE, SORE!"
Donna Booma. You evidently don't know my busts!
Bosshi. That's true. What are they like?
Donna Booma. It's impossible to say what they 're like,
and goodness only knows whom they 're like. But never
mind. We '11 begin to-morrow. Good-night. I can find
my way out. [Exit calmly.
Bosshi. Well I 'm!
ACT II. SCENE—Donna BOOMA's Studio. Window (c) looks
out on Colosseum. Donna BOOMA is at work on her bust
of BOSSHI, her method of sculpture being to buy a bust
already baked, and then to scrape its surface with a
'knife, thereby setting her sitter's teeth on edge and
causing him to groan at frequent intervals.
Bosshi (after a more than usually excruciating scrape).
Isn't there something wrong with that tool?
Donna Booma. No, it always makes that noise.
Bosshi. I suppose that's why so few people become
sculptors. It must be a very painful calling. (Rising)
really-must go now. I am going to make my great speech
in the Colosseum.
Donna Booma. I wish you could have delivered it some-
where else. The acoustic properties of this apartment are
such that I can hear every word that is said in the Colosseum.
Odd, isn't it?
Bosshi. Very.
[Exit by tlie window, which seems to be a popular method
of leaving Donna BOOMA's apartment.
Donna Booma. I do love him dearly. But I wish I wasn't
going to hear that speech again. Poor BOSSHI repeats him-
self sadly.

moment ago?
Donna Booma. Yes. He 'a gone to the Colosseum—to

boy JOSEPH with him, as there seems every prospect of a
riot.

getting on rather nicely. What can I do, do you think, to
improve it?

proceeds to do so regretfully. Enter BRUNO by window.)
Donna Booma. BRUNO! Where 's JOSEPH? Is he hurt?
Bruno (crossly). No. The Police wouldn't lay a finger on
him. The poltroons! When he threw stones at them they
merely cowered in corners and blew their whistles for
assistance.
Donna Booma. But BOSSHI?
Bruno. He ran away. Scenes of violence always unnerve
him. And little JOSEPH was very violent.
Donna Booma (with a cry). He '11 be arrested before he
reaches the frontier!
Baron (testily). Nonsense! Who wants to arrest him? As
far as I am concerned, the sooner he 's out of the country the
better. Let him go back to his organ and his monkey in
Soho.
Donna Booma. You say that because there 's no photo-
graph of him by which he could be identified, and I 've just
broken his bust.
Baron. My dear BOOMA, the bust hadn't the smallest
resemblance to him. You know that well enough. And as
for his photograph, it's been published repeatedly in all
the evening papers. Politicians are always photographed.
Their constituents insist upon it.
Donna Booma (alarmed). Then if he ever does come back
he'll be identified?
Baron. He won't come back. Revolutionaries who run
away never do. His career is over. BOSSHI'S bust.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE practised novel-reader will be puzzled by the opening
chapter of The Little White Bird (HoDDER AND STOUGHTON).
Mr. BARRIE does not stop formally to introduce his dramatis
personal. There they are, and they must explain themselves;
which is, after all, the true dramatic manner from the time
of SHAKSPEARE downwards. Only, in King John, for
example, there is a prefatory table of "Persons represented,"
as "John, King of England; Prince Henry, his son,
afterwards Henry the Third," and so on. Mr. BARRIE does
not even give a name to the delightful elderly bachelor
who tells the story, whilst his heroine is Mary A ,
her husband nameless, and their son simply David.
This is provoking, and might lead short-tempered people,
who don't like being bored with problems when they
take up a novel, to lay the book down after stumbling
through its first chapter. Therein my Baronite assures
them they will make a mistake evermore to be regretted.
This book with its tenderness, its grace, its poetry, will
rank amongst the finest accomplishments of the author of
A Window in Thrums. The description of the wooing of
Mart/ A and the anonymous youth foregathering at the
pillar box finds its only parallel in literature in the courting
of Ruth Pinch in Temple Gardens. Lightly touching and
leaving these human people, making us long to know more
of them, Mr. BARRIE leads the way into Kensington Gardens,
which by a stroke of genius he peoples with fairies, each
possessing an individuality and a humour of its own. After
centuries of existence this immigrant Scot has added a new
world to London. No one who reads TJie Little White Bird
will thereafter walk through Kensington Gardens without
thinking of Peter Pan, Solomon Caw, Queen Mob, Broumie,
Maimie Mainwarinq, and all that takes place there "after
Lock up."
The Baron has no hesitation in pronouncing The Miniature
Series of Painters (GEORGE BELL & SONS) to be a most com-
panionable set; interesting and instructive, and portable.
The series might belong to that department of literature
styled "'Be?!' Lettres."
A Woman's Checkmate (Jons LONG) is a novel by
J. E. MDDDOCK, a name suggestive of "ships that" don't
"pass in the night," but are laid up on their beam ends
in a mud dock during the winter. So it came about that
the Baron expected a stirring tale of the sea. Alas! no.
Mr. MUDDOCK, in somewhat slipshod style, spins a fairly
interesting yarn out of rather worn materials, thus offering
to the alert skipper some rare opportunities for the exercise
of his agility.
It must be far easier to write something original about
Christmas than to invent an entirely new Christmas game,
"and yet," quoth my juvenilest Baronitess, "here are
'Ding-Dong,' 'Trefoil,'and 'Jee-Jo-Jo,' all (FAULKNERS) most
exciting." The Baron takes this as the opinion of an expert.
Also after personal inspection he agrees with the aforesaid
Baronitess that their " 'Art Calendar' is most attractive."
A propos of this same Firm's "Christmas show" the Baron
recognises as somewhat of a novelty, their "National Portrait
Gallery series " of cards, a fanciful "Pierrette and Pierrot
and Channel Island sketch-cards, one side being
series
blank for postal address. This notion might be developed
for invitation cards: address of the invited one side, and
photographs of the place he is to stay at and the sort of
people he will meet on the other. Such truthful representa-
tions would determine the reply.

a batch of books for children of various ages. For the
nursery, says the Baron's Assistant, I can recommend with
enthusiasm Dcnslow's Mother Goose. Nothing more gor-
geously and grotesquely pictorial and attractive has lately
struck my eye. I know one nursery at any rate where it
met with a succes fou. Then for older children, up to, say,
ten years, there is Lassie and Laddie, by MART D. BRINE, a
simple, pleasant story very prettily told. Next I have tested
a group of four suitable for girls in their teens. Miss
Bouverie, by Mrs. MOLESWORTH; A Plucky Girl, by MAY
BALDWIN; Girls of the Forest and The Rebel of the School,
both by L. T. MEADE. All these are very interesting and
admirably wholesome. They have plenty of spirit and dash.
Christmas buyers should not miss them.
When Mr. W. E. W. COLLINS wrote The Don and the
Undergraduate the B. A. expressed a hope that he might
be heard from again. Here he is, then, in Episodes of
Rural Life (BLACKWOOD), a collection of short sketches
excellent in design and not less excellent in execution.
Mr. COLLINS has a great gift of playful unforced humour, he
loves the country and country folk and pleasant dogs, he is
evidently a good cricketer, and his stories are delightful.
A collection of spirited pictures representing the Courting
and Sporting Adventures of Wm. Wobblesimek, Esq. (Messrs.
BRADBURY, AGNEW & Co.), drawn by W. J. HODGSON, is a well-
got-up volume, with plenty in it to amuse. The style of the
letterpress giving the incidents which are the subjects of
the illustrations recalls to the Baron's memory some fairly
familiar passages descriptive of a "run with the harriers"
that occurred in a certain Punchian series entitled Happy
Thoughts, of which work Mr. HODGSON has been evidently an
appreciative student. THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

THE RAVENS.
(After Mr. Seton Merriman.)
II.
THE stately house in Berkeley Square
was lighted up. A great reception -was
being held. That part of London which
was not asleep was awake. Cold-faced
men and hot-hearted women were
streaming up the grand staircase;
diplomatists who shared the same rooms
were being introduced to each other by
their hostess, and exchanging their
views on London scenery. "London,"
said a wit from the banks of the Vistula,
"iB a city to think of, not to think in,"
and he smiled as he thought of the ten
organ-grinders he had that morning
picked off with his pocket-pistol.
RODERICK WAGONER, of the Inter-
national Secret Service, was leaning
against the wall of the great reception
room, waiting for the traffic to pass.
From the height of his six foot ten he
looked gently at the crowd surging
below mm. A quiet, simple man, of
few words, people nevertheless always
turned to look at him, in the street or
in the ball-room, a fact which, in a quiet
way, seemed to amuse this calm, strong,
fair Englishman.
At the other end of the room the
hostess, Lady ORMSBY, was talking of
him to the latest comers, a fine-looking
Russian Count, with beautifully chased
gold crowns on his buttons, and his
daughter, Princess ADELA.
Yes," she was saying, "that is
RODERICK WAGONER. I don't know if
you know that he is one of the greatest
diplomatists we have. They say that
the CZAR admires him so much that
there is a suite of rooms at the Winter
Palace devoted exclusively to his use,
which the CZARINA dusts herself every
day; while the KAISER sends him a
telegram twice a day. But come, my
child," she continued, turning to the
young girl at her side, "let me have
the pleasure of introducing him to you,"
and they passed down the long room
together.
The introduction was effected, and
the two were left alone together.
A dead silence ensued, which the
Princess was the first to break.
"So we meet here again, my—love,"
she said, as she slowly raised her dark
eyes, in which smouldered the wrongs
of fifteen centuries of oppression.
"Again," he replied, with the bow
that men only give to women who are
worthy of it.
'And you are still the same?"
'Still."
'And you are on the one side, and I,"
the words came bravely, " on the other."
'The other," was the quiet answer.
'And Duty and Honour forbid that a

woman should betray her cause," went
on ADELA, with a proud smile.
"They forbid it," he answered.
"So that, even if she knows that ten
bombs are being packed at the Army
and Navy Stores, she must give no
sign?"'
"None."
"Even if they are to be sent off from
Victoria Station on Tuesday evening,
she must keep the knowledge to her-
self?"
"To herself," said the strongman,
who would have died to save this
woman from a pinprick.
They were both silent, with that
perfect comprehension of each other's
thought that can only come where
Honour has triumphed, and Love is
pure and strong.
A quarter of an hour later a servant
placed an Invoice in WAGONER'S hand.
The Invoice referred to a revolving
bookcase, and was dated from the Clock
Tower at Westminster.
WAGONER glanced at it carelessly, and
then threw it into a wastepaper basket.
"So it is to be Moscow this time!"
he said, as he made his way to his
hostess. "And yet I do not think it
will be necessary. I—do—not—think
—it—will—be—necessary.''
In the hall below the servants were
already helping two of his comrades in
the Secret Service into their overcoats.
The Ravens were beginning to croak.
m.
The small waiting-room at the top of
the stairs at Victoria Station is not, one
would think, exactly a cheerful resort,
yet on this Tuesday evening it was
tenanted by no fewer than four men.
Presently one of them got up, and
going to the door, looked out on to the
deserted platform.
No one was in sight but a porter,
who was whistling "God Save the
King! " with much vigour.
"Has a box come from the Army and
Navy Stores, my man?" inquired the
man from the waiting-room, in perfect
English.
"Why, bless you, yes, Sir, 'arf an
hour ago," replied honest BILL SMITH.
"And a gentleman took it away at once
in an 'ansom—to the Foreign Office, for
I 'eard 'im give the address."
The man went silently back to the
waiting-room, and repeated the informa-
tion to the other three men.
"It must have been WAGONER," he
said, and a strange smile crept over
his face. "'That d d strong man,
WAGONER."
There was silence in the little waiting-
room—the silence of strong men in
extremity—and then they went slowly
and thoughtfully to the telegraph office
to send off eight telegrams.
For in their calculations the Ravens
had overlooked the fact that Love is the
greatest Anarchist of all.

Mine is the finest equipment linked to the highest of aims.
Physics, psychology, TOLSTOI, NIETZSCHE, LOMBROSO, VERLAINE,
All have gone into my music, all are stored up in my brain.
Ev'rything have I digested—ev'rything under the sun,
Till I am blest in possessing ev'ry advantage—save one.
I am a British composer, elbowed aside in the race—
Even a hearing denied me, doomed to enduring disgrace.
Would it, I frequently wonder, give me the ghost of a chance
If I renounced my relations, borrowed a surname from
France?
Shall I become a Bohemian, shall I inscribe on my score,
"This is no English production, this is the work of a Boer "?
Or is a Muscovite suffix, imsky, or offsky, or vitch,
Solely and wholly essential Englishmen's ears to bewitch?
Must I insure my left elbow, must I develop a look
Less like a thoroughbred Briton than a diseased pastry-cook?
Tell me, 0 Concert Directors, tell me that I may begin
Changing my name and my nation, sloughing my insular
skin.
We are no megalomaniacs, planners of boycotting schemes,
Bent upon turning the tables, flying to hostile extremes.
Gladly we bow to the masters, yield to their conquering
sway,
Only, as moderns with moderns, claim for the native fair
. pky >~.
Claim for his highest endeavour, claim for his work at its
best
Just an occasional hearing—surely a modest request:
Welcoming foreigners freely, yet, when their " place in the
sun"
Comes to be reckoned in England, grudging them thirty to
one!
TAILORS' TATTLE.
[Sir TATTON STKES' eccentricity in the matter of coata—he always
wears four or five—is said to have its counterpart in Mr. THOMAS
HARDY'S habit of invariably wearing two waistcoats, &c.~\
SHEIKH T-M-THY H-LY (writes a Uganda correspondent) is
noted even amongst Uganda's warriors f or his quaint costume.
Even in the hottest summer, when the mercury boils in the
thermometer and a steak placed in the sun grills in two
minutes, Sheikh H-LY invariably wears four loin cloths and a
pair of gold-rimmed eye-glasses. This peculiarity of the
Sheikh has its counterpart in the sartorial eccentricities of
his ally the MAD MULLAH. Before the latter will start on the
smallest expedition he must attire himself in a double coating
of blacklead.
A curious peculiarity of Doctor CL-FF-RD (writes a Noncon-
formist correspondent) is that he always wears two white ties
—one at the front and one at the back of his collar. This
is not due to personal vanity, but to the fact that in the
excitement of addressing public meetings the Doctor's tie
works out of place. Hence this ingenious contrivance. By
the time the eloquent Doctor has spoken his usual hour and
a half the front tie has worked round to the back and the
back tie has come to the front. Indeed, it is said that in
more than one of his orations on the Education Bill the
silver-tongued Doctor has talked the original tie back to its
first position again. ,
In his morning walks on Putney Common Mr. SW-NB-RNE,
in addition to the pair of lace-up boots which adorns his
feet, carries another pair in his hands. A correspondent,
anxious for information, stopped Mr. SW-NB-RNE and asked
him what he used the second pair of boots for. "I carry
them," said England's greatest lyrist, "to punish impudent
intruders on my privacy." So saying he hurled them with
remarkable accuracy at our correspondent's head and passed
on. All true loversi of poetry will be delighted to hear that
the author of Songs 'before Sunrise retains so much of the
virility of youth.
"SHOULD WE ABANDON THE MEDITERRANEAN?"
[To Sir WILLIAM LAIRD CLOWES, after perusing his masterly attempt
to solve the above conundrum in Mr. Nonius's excellent new Magazine,
Tiie World's Work.']
SIR, I have read your racy tract
In London's latest monthly organ;
And find your gift of naval tact
Scarcely surpassed by Mr. MORGAN.
You map us out the Midland Sea,
And show our ships unrivalled in it,
And yet their use would seem to be
Visibly smaller every minute.
Time was when we would take a turn
In any continental quarrel,
Whether the thing was our concern
Or had an interest merely moral.
But we have come in course of years
To fill a cosmic sphere of action,
Where Europe's little world appears
A purely academic fraction.
As for our Eastern water-way.
Reserved to meet a crucial juncture,
A pinch of dynamite, you say,
Would paralyse the Suez puncture.
But still, as your opponents urge,
This Sea retains its hallowed story;
One may remark about its surge
A halo exquisitely hoary.
Among its isles our sons have cropped
A heritage of rare exemplars:
At Cyprus C<EUR-DE-LION stopped,
And Malta used to teem with Templars.
Good sentiment, but run to seed!
To-day we tackle broader Acres,
Our fleets must serve a larger need,
Escorting mightier Empire-makers.
Lords of a puny Latin pond!
It sounds a rather silly title!
Is it not time we looked beyond,
And clung to issues clearly vital?
Yes, as you say, this Sea must go;
Let France or someone else annex it;
And if the winds of war should blow,
We '11 be content to block the exit.
Yes, let it go; we '11 soon forget
How much it cost our pride to do it:
But not this week! 0 no, not yet,
With Midland JOE careering through it!

DE MAXIMIS CURAT LEX.
(A Law Report of the Future.)
THE trial of Mrs. VERB DE VERB w
concluded yesterday. Before the pro-
ceedings began, the learned Judge
addressing the prisoner, said he was
afraid she might not be quite as com-
fortable as at home, and begged her to
change places with him. His Lordship
then took his seat in the dock, after
handing the prisoner to his chair, where
she was supplied with a footstool and a
Society newspaper. After some more
evidence had been given, the prisoner
said she was tired of reading and felt
awfully hungry. The Court immediately
adjourned, and the prisoner, with a
select party of invited guests, was
entertained to a champagne luncheon in
the Sheriff's room.
A decent interval having been allowed
for coffee, liqueurs and cigarettes, the
trial was resumed, the prisoner again
sitting in the Judge's chair. Sir ST.
JOHN STARS, K.C., Mr. ASTERISKS, K.C.,
Mr. DASH, K.C., and Mr. BUNK, K.C.,
having addressed the. jury on behalf of
the prisoner, the learned Judge was
about to sum up when Mrs. VERB DE
VERB said she was dying for a cup of
tea. The Court immediately adjourned,
and tea was served in the Sheriff's
room. The jury were invited to join
the party, but respectfully declined the
honour.
When his Lordship returned to the
dock the jury intimated that they had
made up their minds, and unanimously
found the prisoner guilty on all the
counts of the indictment. The prisoner
appeared rather surprised at this
verdict, but after the Under-sheriff had
handed her a bottle of smelling-salts,
and the Judge's clerk had fanned her
with a sheet of foolscap paper, she
became as cheerful and unconcerned as
before. Sir ST. JOHN STARS then called
a doctor, who gave evidence that Mrs.
VERB DE VERB suffered occasionally from
chilblains, and that imprisonment might
cause an increase in the attacks of this
serious complaint.
The learned Judge then addressed
the prisoner, and said how much he
regretted to see a lady of her' dignity
and wealth in such a position, or rather
how painful it must be for her to see
him in such a position, though what he
really meant was that the pain was
caused to him by the very rude and
vulgar verdict of the jury, who had
shown no consideration for the feelings
of a lady of good family, and the wife
of a wealthy gentleman, himself a sort
of Judge empowered to maintain the
majesty of the law in his own neigh-
bourhood. His Lordship said, in a
voice broken by emotion, that he con-
sidered the verdict most disrespectful

to the upper classes. However, since
the jury had found her guilty (here his
Lordship held his handkerchief to his
eyes), it became his painful duty, his
extremely painful duty, carefully bearing
in mind the important medical evidence
as to her health, to sentence her (here
his Lordship sobbed aloud) to pay a fine
of half-a-crown.
The fine was at once paid. His Lord-
ship then skipped nimbly from the
dock, and gracefully handed Mrs. VERB
DE VERB to the Sheriff's state carriage,
in which she was driven home. A man
in the street, who ventured to hiss the
lady, was at once arrested by the police,
and committed to prison for contempt
of Court.
The learned Judge then proceeded to
try MARY SMITH, a post-office clerk, for
stealing six postage stamps. The case
was of no interest. His Lordship,
remarking on the enormity of her
offence, sentenced the prisoner to five
years' penal servitude.

sant to hear that the dropped Pilot

congratulations to the skipper, Mr.

MR. PUNCH'S COMPRESSED DRAMAS.
IV.—THE MISADVENTURE OF CAPTAIN KETTLE.
[Suggested by a visit to the play at the Adelphi which Messra.
MALCOLM WATSON and MURRAY CARSON have written round Mr .CDTOLIITE
HYNE'S hero.]
SCENE—The office of an Adventurous Drama Syndicate,
London. Captain KETTLE, a peppery little man with
sandy hair and a goatee beard, is discovered smoj&ng
gtrcely. With him are Messrs. MALCOLM WATSON and
URRAY CABSON.
Captain Kettle (in a menacing tone). So you two are going
to make a play about me, are you?
Mr. Carson (gruffly). Yes.
Kettle (explosively). You '11 nave to be careful what you 're
about or, by James! [Whips out revolver.
Mr. Watson (interrupting him nervously). We shall be
most careful. Please put that away.
Kettle (mollified). Very well. (Replaces revolver in hip
pocket.) But you must snow me how you 're going to do it.
I can't have you doing anything to bring me into disfavour
with the cheaper magazines.
Watson (meekly). Would you like to hear the plot?
Kettle. Perhaps I 'd better. Fire away.
Watson. We open in the office of a Comic Irishman in
Liverpool. (Complacently) That will be a popular feature!
Kettle (jumping up in a passion). By James!
Carson (crossly). Do sit down. And I wish you wouldn't
keep on using that oath. It's idiotic.
Kettle (reseating himself). Nonsense. I always use it.
The public wouldn't know me without it. It's as character-
istic of me as my chin beard or my revolver. Go on.
Watson. Everyone in the Comic Irishman's office is in
mortal terror of you.
Kettle (pleased). Come—that's better.
Watson. So they all retire to the strong room as soon as
you enter, and communicate with you through the speaking
tube. Humorous, eh? Ha! ha!
Kettle (acidly). Well?
Watson. Of course you produce your revolver—no, you
needn't do it now—and. threaten to wreck the office with it.
Kettle. Couldn't I use a chair? I could do a lot more
damage with a chair.
Carson (impatiently). Certainly not. The public associates
you with a revolver, not with a chair. Besides, we can't
have you breaking the properties.
Kettle. All right. What happens next?
Carson (yawning). Oh, after a lot of bluster and "By
James " and similar nonsense the Comic Irishman emerges,
and you agree to go in a steam yacht to rescue a prisoner in
a French Penal Settlement. That's the end of Act I.
Kettle. Don't think much of that.
Carson (briefly). Nor do I. But it '11 have to do. In Act II.
—(Yawning) What happens in Act II., WATSON?
Watson. In Act II. you are on the yacht. The lady to
whom it belongs wishes to kidnap you. She loves you,
Captain.
Kettle (fiercely). I won't have it. I 'm a married man.
Watson (soothingly). Yes, but she 's Spanish, you know.
Spanish ladies do these things. Besides, you refuse to have
anything to say to her.
Kettle (mollified). Very well.
Watson. So the crew assemble ostentatiously upon the
quarter-deck to make you prisoner.
Kettle (roused). I see. I fire into the brown, kill half a
dozen, wound the rest, and keep the yacht for my pains.
Watson {hastily). No, no. Not a bit like it. You don't
shoot anybody. In fact, you don't shoot a single person
throughout the entire play.
Kettle (horrified). Not shoot anyone?
Carson (crossly). Certainly not. Your revolver isn't
loaded. Your steward has drawn the cartridges.
Kettle (outraged). So I 'm to be made a prisoner, ajn I?
Well, that may be your conception of drama, but it isn't mine.
Watson (soothingly). It's only for ten minutes. Then
you 're released again.
Kettle (relieved). How do I manage that?
Carson. Easily enough. You see, after they have bound
you the crew dump you down upon the deck and go below,
leaving you quite unguarded.
Kettle. Will the audience swallow that?
Carson (grimly). They '11 have to swallow a lot more than
that before we 're through.
Wateon. Naturally your friend on board, who happens
to be away at the moment in the jolly-boat, returns in the
nick of time, and as everyone seems to have forgotten his
existence he is able to set you free at once. The crew
return to the deck. You threaten everybody with your
revolver, and the mutiny is quelled.
Kettle. I thought you said my revolver wasn't loaded?
Carson (impatiently). No more it is. But they 've for-
gotten that. Or at least, we had. That ends Act H.
Kettle. I call it beastly rot so far. Go on with Act HI.
Watson. In Act HI. the scene is the French Penal Settle-
ment. And here we bid good-bye to the last glimmerings
of reason. The prisoner has escaped by the aid of the
prison laundress, whom he has promised to marry. You are
suspected of having rescued him, and are about to be shot by
the French when the prisoner saves you by giving himself up.
Kettle (enthusiastically). Noble fellow!
Carson (testily). Not at all. He's an absolute sweep.
Why on earth he gives himself up to save you I don't know,
except that he doesn't want to marry the laundress. Do you
know, WATSON?
Watson (shaking his head). It doesn't seem very clear.
Kettle (scandalised). My dear WATSON! I appeal to you
as a dramatic critic. Is that good enough?
Carson. Nonsense. When a dramatic critic begins to
write plays anything's good enough. And I wish you
wouldn't say "My dear WATSON" like that. You're not
Sherlock Holmes.
Kettle (sadly). I begin to wish I was. I believe I should
run longer! Gret on.
Watson. The prisoner is marched back to jail. So are
you. There 's a Comic Irish Sentry
Kettle (faintly). By James!
Watson. You put a sack over the sentry's head to enable
the other fellow to escape. Subsequently you escape your-
self, concealed in a washing-basket.
Kettle (pondering). Haven't I seen a similar incident to
that on the stage before?
Carson (crossly). No! You 're thinking of Falstaff in
Merry Wives. This isn't a bit like it. I wish it was!
Watson. Act IV. deals with the Spanish lady's determina-
tion to be President of a South American Republic. You
are brought to her assistance—still in the washing-basket.
Kettle (alarmed). Have I been in it ever since Act HI.?
Watson. I suppose so. The Comic Irishman turns up
again.
Kettle. Which one? The Liverpool person or the sentry?
Carson (brusquely). Both if you like. Their presence is
quite unnecessary to the plot.
Kettle. Then why bring them in?
Watson (with dignity). My dear fellow, in melodrama one
should always bring everybody on in the last Act. That is
what is called construction.
Kettle. I see. Well?
Watson. The President abdicates. The Spanish lady suc-
ceeds him. She asks you to share her presidential throne.

and you refuse. The curtain falls to
the strains of " Home, Sweet Home."
KetOe (blankly). Is that all?
Carson (bored). Yes. And enough
too, I should think.
Kettle. And do you mean to tell me
it has taken the combined intellects of a
popular actor and a prominent dramatic
critic to produce that?

Kettle. Hum! I wonder what Mr.

(With apologies to Mr. Barrie'a "Little

IT was the day when WILLIAM brought
me a mutton cutlet instead of a chop.
WILLIAM, you must let me tell you, is
a waiter at my Club. I think I took
him out of an old Christmas number of
an illustrated paper. Not that this
matters much; and the third turning
to the right when you are past the Park
gates brings you out directly opposite
the Post Office. Why do I tell you
this? I hardly know; but it may have
something to do with the story, if you
wait long enough. Or it may not. Poor
little Post Office! Grim old bachelor
as I am, you touch me strangely.
0 MARY, MARY!
1 hate mutton cutlets, and I said so.
To be precise, I observed: "You dun-
derheaded simpleton, you blighted
nincompoop !"—I always talk like this
in order to conceal my tenderness of

Biy Brother. "LOOK HEBE, BILLY, IT'S NO GOOD rot; HANGING ROCND. Yon STAND NO CHANCE

heart—" you 've bungled again, you
idiot!" And here I slipped some-
thing white and crisp into his right
hand.
"Sir!" gasped WILLIAM—a good man
as waiters go, but apt to be surprised at
my most commonplace actions.
"If you say a single word I '11 knock
your ugly head off!" cried I, transfer-
ring another banknote into his left hand.
"A chop this moment, WILLIAM!"
What made WILLIAM'S mistake the
more distressing was that I had but just
returned from the Gardens, together
with Aramis and a tremendous
appetite. (Aramis is a Newfoundland
dog in this chapter, but we '11 turn him
into a human being before long.) Such
a walk we had had—JONATHAN Z.,
Aramis and I! Right past the Green
Patch (which is where you fall and soil
your pinafore), and along the Topsy-
Turvy path (it was here that Miss
JENNY LEE swallowed sixty-one pepper-
mints; I must tell you about this some-
time), and so out by the Sugarloaf
Island, and home. And just as I had
reached the Club a tall young lady of
twenty-one threw herself down before
me, and tried to clasp my knee, and
sobbed out idiotic speeches of grati-
tude.
"Avaunt, monster!" I exclaimed;
and she ambled away—rather like a cow,
I thought. Now this, you will be sur-
prised to hear, was the daughter of
WILLIAM, the waiter. And one day,
twenty years ago, when she was quite a
baby, she had a pain in her inside.
She had a pain in her inside because
her food disagreed with her, And her
food disagreed with her because it
wasn't cooked enough. And it wasn't
cooked enough because the milkman was
late on his rounds, owing to a fog.
(Later on you will hear all about this.)
So the baby cried, which made WILLIAM'S
wife cross. She, with the instinct of
her sex (0 MARY !) took it out of
WILLIAM. Consequently the poor man
was quite muddle-headed all day, and
brought me a cutlet, as I have explained,
when I had ordered a chop.
Ah me! Was this twenty years ago,
or was it to-day?
It is all rather confusing.

EXCHANGE AND MART.
[An American lady has recently made an
offer through the " Exchange Department" of a
feminine paper. TENOTSON would be "gladly
exchanged " for " a few fruit jars." She " would
like to exchange BYRON for some old lace," and
adds, "I also need a little improved cabbage-
seed, for which I will give a fairly good copy
of BCNTAN'S Pilgrim's Progress."}
GREAT singer, on whose laureate brow
The wreath sat worthily enow,
Thou saidst in pessimistic strain,
Thy "mortal lullabies of pain
Might bind a book, might line a box,
Might serve to curl a maiden's locks."
But didst thou ever contemplate
Such rigours of a ruthless fate,
Or dream that thy poetic thought
To such base uses might be brought?
Alas, poor TENNYSON! How strange
That anyone would "gladly change "—
Ay, "gladly"—that one well might call
The most unkindest cut of all—
The music of thy tuneful bars
For—think of it!—" a few fruit jars."
And this same inexpressive She,
How, BYRON, does she value thee?
The lyric rage, the frenzied, wild
Desires of thy poetic Childe—
Lives there the heart too dead to feel,
Too cold to answer»such appeal?
This haggling soul would stickle not
To strike a bargain of the lot.
If BYRON rules so low to-day,
Then what price Pilgrim's Progress,
pray?
A little cabbage-seed ?—Rest, rest,
Perturbed JOHN! let not thy breast
Be overmuch to anger moved—•
The cabbage-seed must be "improved."

And finger with caressing hand

Your precious volumes can be worth.
INDEXITIS; OR, ALPHABETOMANIA.
THIS distressing cerebral complaint
made its appearance in London during
the summer months of this year, and has
raged with considerable virulence in the
neighbourhood of the British Museum.
It is believed to be an American impor-
tation, and to have spread through the
agency of a colossal and Encyclopaedic
undertaking, which is being pursued in
our very midst with the full connivance
of the authorities. The victims have
been mostly adults who have not quite
forgotten their ABC; for children,
except in the Balfourian sense, escape
from the contagion. A large percentage
of the metropolitan " free-lances," not to
speak of doctors, barristers, ex-school-

masters, actresses (resting), and singers,
have been attacked. The symptoms in
the earlier stages of the epidemic were
somewhat obscure, but the bacillus
has now been identified, and it is con-
fidently expected that within a few days
the worst will be over. The survivors
will then be free to pursue their ordinary
vocations, if they have not already
found quarters in the various lunatic
asylums.
Among the more typical cases which
Mr. Punch has been called in to
diagnose are the following :—
CASE No. 1.—A. B., 43 years of age,
married, and father of nineteen children.
Was seized with a violent attack after
working overtime, and found marshal-
ling the family in his back garden with
labels affixed (W for "Wrong," D for
"Duplicate," and S for " Superfluous ")
under the impression that they were
"Card-entries." He had also obtained
a large waste-paper basket for his wife
(to be put in).
Treatment.—K fortnight's attendance
at Mr. Plowden's Police Court, listening
to his obiter dicta on the duties of a
husband and father. Was discharged
as incurable on attempting to index nis
Worship's witticisms.
CASE No. 2.—C. D., aged 27, single
woman. Keeping house for her brother.
The peculiar feature of this case was
that the patient insisted on rearranging
the order of the items of her daily menu.
The courses of the dinner therefore
appeared thus :—Cheese, Coffee, Dessert,
Entree, Fish, Hors d'oeuvres, Ices,
Joint, Soup, Sweets, with the result
that six cooks gave notice in a week,
one after another, and the brother, to
avoid indigestion, gave up eating
altogether and took to drink.
Treatment.—A meal of one course
only, viz. a salad of all the above-men-
tioned items together, was found to
restore the patient's mental equilibrium,
after a vain attempt on her part to sort
out the various ingredients in their
proper order. When last heard of she
was imitating Succr.
CASE No. 3.—X. Y., bachelor, age not
given. Here the mania for alphabetiza-
tion took a peculiar form. The victim
betrayed a disposition to betroth
himself successively to ladies whose
surnames began with A, B, C, etc., in
order. Had, however, failed with Q,X,
and Z, and suffered from extreme
melancholia in consequence.
Treatment.—Ordered to read, four
times a day, Mr. Punch's "Advice to
Those About to Marry.'' Result: Doubt-
ful up to the time of going to press.
Tried to prevaricate that the Advice did
not relate to Those About to be Merely
Engaged.
CASE No. 4.—G. F., 297 years old,
widower. Taken up on November 5
for causing an obstruction in Holborn.
On examination at the Police Office, it
was discovered that he had put his
clothes on in alphabetical order—boots
first, then braces, coat, cravat, hat,
pants, socks, trousers, vest, and lastly
waistcoat. To these some sympathisers
had attached squiba and crackers in
their proper and respective positions.
Treatment. — Was let off by the
stipendiary together with the fireworks,
and taken home on a stretcher. Since
then discovered to be a man of straw.
Mr. Punch could cite further cases
of mental obliquity, but considers the
foregoing sufficient for those who are
anxious to have an Index Finger in the
resulting Printer's Pie.

To make the mutton last.

The truceless wars of peace;
Go, humour whimsy housemaids,
And wait your cook's caprice.
And when your hopes are highest,
(When both ends nearly meet),
Your lord's untimely lavishness
Shall all your thrift defeat.
Take up the housewife's burden—
Ye shall not shun the call;
Nor cry too loud on Culture,
When darns and dusting pall.

CHARIVARIA.
A FEATURE of recent times is the way
in which the Colonies have been drawn
closer to the Mother Country. One or
two of them now promise to be especially
close in the matter of contributions to
the National Navy.
Many of the diplomatic representa-
tives of the Ottoman Empire abroad
have received no salary for over a year.
A request for payment has been met
with the replv that it is a matter of
regret to the Ottoman Government that
the national finances will not admit of
such payments being made. There is,
in consequence, much grumbling among
the diplomats, and it is thought that,
with a view to pacifying them, the
SULTAN will increase their salaries.
It is well known that all work and no
play makes JACK a dull boy, but in the
statement that, on our new cruisers,
Maxim-guns are to be discarded in
favour of ping-pongs, there is an obvious
printer's error.
A cannon has been found to be missing
from the defences of Sydney Harbour.
That is the worst of a certain kind of
gun. It is liable to go off unexpectedly.
The incident, by the way, reminds us
of the report that, not so long ago, one
of our most recently adopted guns was
stolen from Portsmouth, and subse-
quently discovered in the State Museum
of a certain foreign Power.
The following telegram comes from
Kingston, Jamaica :—" Sir AUGUSTUS
HEMMING, the Governor, and his family,
returned to the Colony to-day after an
absence of five months. His Excellency
had a hearty welcome. A severe earth-
quake shock was experienced here at
3 o'clock." Yet people still discuss
the pathetic fallacy!
The Rev. H. MAULSOK believes that
dogs have souls. Dogs, we hear, are
not so sure about men.
Juries are human, after all. In the
stage slander case at Manchester alle-
gations were made as to the free and
easy conduct of the ladies who frequented
the Comedy Theatre at that town. The
jury requested leave to visit it.
It is now announced that, following
the example of Professor GOLDWIN SMITH,
a number of "distinguished Americans"
have bequeathed their brains to Cornell
University for scientific investigation.
Curiously the newspapers of the same
date contained a paragraph about a
gentleman who hau recently died, and
had, by his will, disposed of consider-
ably more property than he possessed.
Since 1880 the gross public debts of
Australia and New Zealand have leaped
from £90,000,000 to £280,000,000, and
these Colonies are still trying to borrow.
Suggested revision of motto:—"Advance
to Australia."
Count TOLSTOI will publish about
Christmas-time a new liook entitled
The Corpse. His gift of fancy is said
to be as fresh and dainty as ever.
Ex-P. KKUGER'S MEMS.—From recent
letters written by credible witnesses it
seems that the Ex-President and his
immediate surroundings — who could
not by any manner of means have been
termed his "suite,"—were transformed
from "horrid Boers " into "dirty pigs."
At least such apparently is the opinion
of correspondents in the Times, cor-
roborated by Mr. MELTON PRIOR, who
might truly have signed himself " ONE
WHO NOSE'D."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Nov. 24.
—RICHARD THE THIRD, asleep in his tent
on the eve of Bosworth Field, had quite
a pleasant time of it compared with DON
JOSE. He suffered but for a portion of a
night, and there was some limit to the
procession of long-laid ghosts that rose
to disconcert him. DON Jos6 never
knows from hour to hour what ghost of
a speech made in unregenerate times
may not rise and mock him. As he
remarked to-night, circumstances change,
and with them men's opinions. His
misfortune is that most active epoch of
a strenuous life befell between 1880 and
1885. He was then more Royalist than
the king (GLADSTONE). His unauthorised
programme, greatly cheering extreme
Radicals, gave pause to some of his
Cabinet colleagues, notably including
the present Leader of House of Lords.
The then President of Board of Trade
flashed over the country like a whirl-
wind, blasting churches, denominational
schools, the House of Lords, and,
generally, people who toil not, neither
do they spin. Unfortunately for DON
Jos6 his words were, as they say in the
police court, taken down, and have since
been used as evidence against him. To
paraphrase a characteristic remark,
What I have written was printed. Thus
it has come to pass that by strange
irony the most powerful, pungent,
unanswerable critic of the conduct and
policy of Lord SALISBURY'S third and
fourth administration, of PRINCE ARTHUR'S
first, has been their chief pillar.
The peculiarity of the situation illus-
trated to-night afresh. Brother GERALD
in lively and concise speech, an hour and
a half long by Westminster clock, moved
resolution confirming Brussels Conven-
tion, whereby certain Sugar Bounties,
from which the British consumer has
hugely benefited, will be abolished.
Till midnight the talk rumbled, speech
after speech denouncing suicidal pro-
ject; ominous signs of unrest mani-
fested on Ministerial benches. The
speeches were woefully long, wholly
destructive of principle of debate. The
briefest, most searching, most destruc-
tive criticism of action of His Majesty's
Government in matter of Sugar Bounties
was found in an extract SQUIRE OF MAL-
WOOD read from memorandum bearing
sign manual of President of Board of
Trade in 1881. The very same question
to the fore; the same facts operative;
the identical principle at stake. DON
Jos6, taking up his pen, pierced the
fallacy through and through; rent the
proposal to shreds, cast them to the
winds, not to be heard of again till
fatuous Baron HENRY DE WORMS, holding
a minor Ministerial position, attempted
to put the pieces together. Result so
disastrous that his affrighted colleagues
made haste to hustle Baron HENRY into
House of Lords, and there it seemed an
end on 't.
That was in 1888. Fourteen years
later the policy is adopted by Unionist
Government, and, of all men, DON Jos£,
President of Board of Trade in 1881,
terror of poor Baron DE WORMS in 1888,
comes forward as chief supporter, if
report be true, inaugurator of the very
policy twenty-one years ago shrivelled
in the blast of his relentless invective!
CRANTORNE not been much to the
fore of late; content to live on reputa-
tion of his haughty answer flung at
trembling Japan: "We grant treaties,
we do not seek them." But Cousin
HUGH, like the poor, is always with us.
Since Education Bill came to the front
he has been on the alert, urgent that
no harm shall come to Mother Church.
Understood to hold midnight meetings
in the crypt in secret confabulation with
the Primate and the Bishops. Just
when PRINCE ARTHUR, after infinite
trouble, has engineered a critical clause

RICHARD III. (REVISED VERSION).
Joseph (airily). "Ah! here come those funny ghosts again! Getting quite used to 'em!"
Unlike RICHARD THE THIRD, DON Jos6
shows no sign of perturbation when this
last, perhaps of all most embarrassing,
ghost presents itself. "Circumstances
change, and opinions alter with them."
With the same confident bearing, the
same incisive speech, standing on the
same lofty platform of patriotic policy,
he demonstrates that what was hope-
lessly wrong in 1881 is imperatively
right in 1902.
Business done.—On resolution ap-
proving Brussels Convention, Ministerial
majority in full House, under urgent
Whip, runs down to 87.
Tuesday night. —" Life would be
endurable only for its cousins," said
PRINCE ARTHUR, his eye resting for a
moment with disturbed glance on Under
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, travelling
beyond Gangway till it fell upon the
ascetic face and frail figure of Cousin
HUGH.
over a rusty piece of road, Cousin HUGH
rises in his pulpit below the Gangway
and either excommunicates his hapless
cousin, cursing his clause by bell, book,
and candle, or submits an amendment
obviously drafted from a passage in the
Athanasian Creed.
To-day set apart for consideration of
Report stage of Bill. Time and oppor-
tunity for making it better in interests
of national education are short. At
eleven o'clock the guillotine will get to
work, and further discussion will be
impossible. For ordinary business
assembly the thing to do would be
forthwith to take up Bill, and in briefest
fashion discuss and decide upon re-
maining amendments. Cousin HUGH,
however, stepped in with a new clause
bristling with controversial points.
Not the remotest chance of passing it.
If Government adopted it, it would
mean the revolutionising and remodel-

Lord Hugh. "Yes, I quite take your Grace's point, but you see the trouble is we have an

ling of the Bill, involving another fort-
night's sitting. What of that? In the
dim recesses of the crypt, to the tolling
of Big Ben moaning midnight, the
clause was drafted. Cousin HUGH moved
it, and the whole of the afternoon sitting
is taken up with the discussion.
As for PRINCE ARTHUR, episcopal associa-
tion, though reaching him only at second
hand, suggests what plain, uncompro-
mising Mr. BRYCE regards as a Jesuitical
course. Except for the extreme clerical
Earty Cousin HUGH'S clause has no
•iends. It is contemptuously dismissed
from consideration on the Opposition
side, whilst from the Ministerial benches
comes the voice of Mr. MIDDLEMORE,
wittily describing it as endeavouring to
enforce Christianity in compartments.
The thing being foredoomed, PRINCE
ARTHUR, yielding to the call of cousinly
affection, feels safe in leaving his fol-
lowers to go as they please. For
himself he will not vote at all, and the
Government Whips will not take official
part in the division.
So, upwards of four hours of
sitting having been unblushingly wasted,
Cousin HUGH leads fifty-seven righteous
men into the lobby, the sinners, too
often in a majority, mustering 243.
Business done.—Education Bill at
Report Stage.
Friday night.— BONAR LAW, whose
maiden speech from Treasury Bench
was one of the features of debate on
Sugar Bounties, will go far. To begin
with, he is a private discovery of PRINCE
,,_ Wisdom likes to be justified
of her children, and it is a good thing
for starters in public life to be proteges
of the PRIME MINISTER. But the new
Secretary to Board of Trade will get
along without personal favouritism.
His speech in one detail a tour de force.
Ordinarily a young Minister standing at
the Table for the first time to take part
in big debate fortifies himself with a
sheaf of notes. The Secretary to the
Board of Trade had not even jotted
down a mem. on his thumb-nail. Master
of the subject, gifted with power of
lucid expression, he made what was,
take it for all in all, the best speech in
defence of a hopeless position.'
His fault, easily got over by taking
thought, is too rapid delivery. Made
it difficult always to follow his argument.
Another mannerism to be avoided is
toying with the brass loop in the centre
of the Ministerial box, still dented by
application of Mr. GLADSTONE'S argu-
ments. Very early in his speech BONAR
LAW'S glance fell upon this not un-
common accessory to a box. Thereafter
it exercised upon him a fatal fascination.
Standing back half a pace he, time after
time, advanced to the Table, cautiously
put forth a forefinger, and, lifting the
sunken brass loop, tilted it over to the
other side, starting back in amazement
at the result.
A remarkable discovery. Through
the ages, certainly from the time of
Lord JOHN RUSSELL, no Minister even
noticed that in the centre of the box is
this brass ring, presumably designed
to "lift the lid. Certainly none in the
course of his speech discovered that
with forefinger inserted it could be
turned over. Credit is due to Parlia-
mentary Secretary to Board of Trade.
The incident testified to quick observa-
tion, and aptitude for mechanics. But
the matter is not worth insisting upon.
Well worth noting that BONAR LAW'S
success was achieved within the space of
twenty minutes. The debate never
quite recovered from depressing in-
fluence of Brother GERALD'S lively and
concise discourse of an hour and a half.
SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, quick to see the
mote in PRINCE ARTHUR'S brother's eye,
happy in his manner of indicating it,
presently displayed a beam in his own.
His speech opened brightly, but drifted
into the abyss measured by an hour and
a quarter. The fatal example spread,
varied only by LAW'S speech, at once
the shortest and most successful of the
sitting.
For years the MEMBER FOR SARK, a
voice crying in the wilderness, has
insisted that, with exceedingly few
exceptions, such as the exposition of an
intricate Bill, everything it is useful to
say in debate can be compressed within
the space of twenty minutes. AsQurrH,
one of the most effective Parliamen-
tary debaters, rarely exceeds that limit.
BONAK LAW'S triumph on the same line
should work wholesome effect upon
general habit. But it won't.
Business done.—Report Stage of
Education Bill carried by closure.
MUSICAL NOTE FOR BECHSTEIN HALL.—
To read of a programme put forward
by the Musical Artists' Union is en-
couraging to musical art. What per-
fection in variety may not be expected
from a union of colours—for there are
colours in music—under the direction
of Mr. LAURENCE RAINBOW!
The Lucas Malet Birthday Book is
made up of materials from L. M.'s
various works, deftly extracted by OLIVIA
DETHRIDGE, and placed in a pretty cover
by FISHER UNWIN as "a dainty dish to
set before" those who revel in dates
and autographs. The compiler is to be
congratulated on the Little Jack Horner-
like way in which she has picked out
most of the nice things from the un-
pleasant Calmady story wherewith to
spice this compound for Christmas.
To ETONIANS.—Might not any scholar
distinguishing himself among the Col-
legians under the present Headmaster-
ship be correctly described as "A ' Tug'
of WARRE "?

HOW TO GET ON.
No. IV.—IN SOCIETY.
(Continued.)
I WAS telling you last week about our little circle in Glen
Edward's Avenue in the days long ago, before the serpent,
at whom I hinted, had come into our midst for our -undoing.
Before I tell the story of the serpent I should, however,
like to add a few more details to complete the picture of
what we were.
We used to have a good many marriages from time to
time, for we always had a plentiful supply of nice girls in
stock, and our young men and the male friends they brought
amongst us were of a sound, steady-going family kind, not
overburdened with riches, of course, but in fairly good
positions, with a prospect of advancing themselves by their
own etrorts. A youngster who could command £300 or £400
a year never imagined for a moment that he could be
frowned upon as being unable to provide for a wife, and, as
a matter of fact, he never was so frowned upon. He didn't
waste his time in thinking himself too poor, and incurring
large debts to tailors and haberdashers and florists. Not a
bit of it: if he fell in love and the girl seemed to like him,
he just went in like a man and popped the question in the
good old style. "Miss HARRISON," he would say, "I have
something rather important to—ahem—communicate to you.
I thought, Miss HARRISON—that is, I wondered—may I call
you KATIE? Well, KATIE, will you marrv me?" Thereupon
KATIE would blush in the back drawing-room, and hang her
head and murmur, "Oh, Mr. FIELDING "(" Call me DICK,
do," from the gentleman)—"Ob, this is so sudden, Mr.—
DICK, I mean—no, no, I really—well, just one, then." And
DICK would go off the happiest man on earth, but for the
gloomy shadow cast upon him by the approaching interview
with Papa. And not long afterwards Mr. and Mrs. HARRISON
would beg the honour of our company to the marriage of
their daughter CATHERINE EMILY with Mr. EICHARD FIELDING,
and nearly all of us would accept and turn up at the church
in full strength, and then proceed to the house for a
substantial wedding breakfast (old style), at which there were
speeches—a feeling one from Uncle WOOSNAM, proposing the
health of the bride and bridegroom, a manly one from DICK
P'IELDING, which produced tears of affection and sentiment
from Mrs. HARRISON and the whole available body of aunts
married and single, and finally a humorous one from TOM
TRANTER, the best man, proposing the bridesmaids in a
chorus of giggles from these amiable and fascinating
creatures. There were no fashionable paragraphs about the
wedding in the evening papers, but the local hatter, who
was always chief of the corps of waiters on these occasions,
and was also a contributor to our district weekly, used to
provide a column or so to that organ, relating now Miss
HAUUISON had been "led to the hymeneal altar," and how
the catering had been provided on its usual scale of comfort-
able magnificence by Messrs. BLOSSOM AND BRANCH, "so well
known in the district for their efforts in this special depart-
ment of catering.'" A full description of the wedding-cake
and a long list of presents concluded the account. Then
after a few weeks the young couple came back and set up
house amongst us, and our wives all went and called on
Mrs. FIELDING, who had been, so to speak, brought up
amongst them, but would have eaten ner wedding-dress
sooner than visit anyone who had not paid her the compli-
ment of such a call. It was all very simple and pleasant
and easy, and we had it all over again in the following year
when we helped to turn off TOM TRANTER.
Another indication of our social simplicity may be gleaned
from our attitude towards royal personages. Of course we
knew—and proud we were of the knowledge—that we had

THE SPREAD OF EDUCATION.
"COME AND 'AVE A LOOK, MARIEB. THEY 'VE BEEN AND PUT A CHIOK
ON A LIDT'S 'AT, AND THEY DON'T KNOW 'ow TO SPELL IT!"
a QCEEN and a Court and a Prince and Princess of WALES,
and the rest of the Royal Family. Some of us had even
seen them and cheered them at processions or the layings
of foundation stones—but there we stopped. We never
pretended either to ourselves or to one another that we were
on terms of familiarity with royalties or their circle. If in
those days any Glen Edward's Avenue man had said to
another, "Painful business this about old FDZZLETOP: I
wonder how he 's going to get out of it," his friend, far
from understanding that he was referring to a great and
titled personage, would have stared blankly and asked for
an explanation. Indeed we were quite Spanish in our tacit
assumption that members of our royal house not only failed
to have legs, but that they were saved by their position and
our respect from all the other attributes of mortality. I can
remember that TOM TRANTER in his bachelor days was
supposed to have committed a very serious offence against
courtesy and good manners by speaking in a matter-of-fact
tone of a happy event which was then being expected in a
Palace. We knew just as much about it as he did, naturally,
but we all resented what he said as an undue affectation
of familiarity. These events were not usually referred
to in anticipation, but, of course, when they came off
we had the church bells rung and hung out our flags
and showed our loyalty in every possible way. It took
TOM a long time to recover from his unlucky use of the word
"confinement" in connection with a royal Princess. There 's
a very nice polite French equivalent, which carries with it a
much loftier idea, and is, therefore, obviously more suitable
when you are talking of people born in the purple. If TOM
had used that word nobody would have minded a bit, but I
suppose he wasn't quite certain about the pronunciation, a
matter about which some of us were sticklers—especially
HOBSON, who had once spent four days in Paris, and was a

good deal deferred to as a first-hand authority on barricades
and revolutions.
Such was our condition. Of course you will say we were
suburban, and, having said so, you will imagine you have
stamped us as being mean and unworthy of consideration.
For my part I prefer to think that we were primitive and
simple, and had most of the virtues implied by these words.
To us, then, living our lives in the fashion I have described,
there arrived HILARY JOWETT, the serpent. But I must defer
him for another week. (To be continued.)
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
QUEEN ANNE is dead, and Mr. JUSTIN MCCARTHY has written
the history of her reign. The two handsome volumes pub-
lished by CHATTO AND WINDCS form a fitting appanage to
those standard works, A History of Our Own Times and A
History of the Four Georges. They have the same charm
of literary style, are enriched by the same gift of creation,
in swift sentences, of picturesque figures that in various
ways have played a part in. the making of the Empire. The
Reign of Queen Anne is an epoch peculiarly attractive to
Mr. McCARTHY. It was an age of great wars, great men,
and a new birth of English literature. The men glide
across these pages in the outward habit fashioned two
hundred years ago. Mr. MCCARTHY does not limit his sketch
or commentary to actual contemporaries of Queen ANNE, for
we have MARLBOROUGH and ADDISON, BERKELEY and BOLINGBROKE,
BCRKE and BURNET, CLARENDON and COLLEY GIBBER, DEFOE
and DRYDEN, GODOLPHIN and GRATTAN, HOGARTH and HANDEL,
JOHNSON and BEN JONSON, ORMONDE and ROBERT HARLEY,
PETERBOROUGH and POPE, SACHEVERELL and SWIFT, WALPOLE
and, not least interesting, the homely sun round which
these constellations at less or greater distance revolved—
Queen ANNE. My Baronite has found the narrative more
enthralling in interest than the average novel.
If dainty books my lady please, then the Baron is sure
she would be delighted with this re-issue of ELIZABETH BAR-
RETT BROWNING'S poems and those of TENNYSON, each collection
in a clearly printed, artistically bound volume (BLACKIE AND
SON), portable and pocketable, with an appreciative preface
by Mi stress ALICE MEYNELL, than whom there are few better
qualified for this work, which is to her a labour of love.
The Four Feathers (SMITH, ELDER), by A. E. W. MASON, is
a work, says my Nautical Retainer, on which any author
might have the best warrant to plume himself. It is the
study of a nature physically nervous in defiance of cumula-
tive heredity. Forced by family tradition to enter the
service, young Feversham lives in terror of disgracing
himself; and to avoid this he finds some natural excuse
for sending in his papers at the moment when Ms
regiment is ordered to the front. Three of his fellow
officers mark their sense of his behaviour by posting to
him a packet containing their cards and one white
feather apiece. To these a fourth is added from the fan
of the indignant lady who was about to marry him,
though she nearly breaks her heart in the act. The book
tells how he sets himself to redeem the fault of nature, and
by mere force of moral courage (for he retains his physical
terror in prospect of peril, though never in the actual face of
it) endures hazards and sufferings more deadly than could be
found on any field of battle. The issue must be left to the
reader to trace.
Mr. MASON has a clear eye for environment and a cunning
hand to portray it. He is equally at his ease in Donegal or
the Soudan. His account of the House of Stone, the terrible
prison at Omdurman, is vivid and enthralling. Perhaps his
appreciation of the psychologic effect likely to be produced

, TUERE 's THREE MONTHS' near ra THE DRAWING-ROOM!"
"THAT ISN'T MY FAULT, MOM. You KNOW I 'VE ONLY BIN HEHK A
FORTNIGHT!"
by abnormal physical conditions is more successful than his
actual observation of normal character. His studies of
women just fall short of probability. He is himself, like
his Ethne, a little the creature of theories. He believes that
as a general principle brute courage is, for women, the most
appealing quality in man. But he does not allow for the
personal element. With so gentle a nature as Ethne's, Love
and Pity woidd have found their opportunity in her lover's
disgrace. Her first instinct would have been to try the
power of her sympathy to console him for the gift of the
three feathers, certainly not to complete the quartette—very
certainly not to spoil her best fan in the process. Again,
one asks oneself, in view of the exceptional heroism brought
out by exceptional circumstances, whether the normal condi-
tions by which Feversham was bound to uphold the honour
both of his Queen and his lady, would not have called out
at least a normal exhibition of courage. But the book is
fascinating, and that is really all that need be said.
Let anyone who wants a good hearty laugh read The Lady
of the Barge, by W. W. JACOBS (HARPERS). There are also in
this volume some stories that prove Mr. JACOBS a "master of
craft" in the direction of creepiness. But it is not for these
but for his genuine sense of humour as herein exemplified
that this book is strongly recommended by the appreciative
BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

bered with the most artistically success-
ful of our day.
Latest advices from Ireland show that
the Union of Hearts is already a fait
accompli. Dr. WALSH has been seen
walking down Grafton Street arm-in-
arm with Chief Baron PALLES. Mr.
REDMOND has presented Mr. O'BRIEN
with a diamond breast-pin. Lastly,
Mr. HEALY, in the intervals of editing a
complete edition of the orations of

volume of stories for children, entitled,
Chronicles of a Kilkenny Kitten.
How exaggerated are the usual reports
concerning the dangers of influenza may
be gathered from the experiences of
Dr. METHUSALEH TIBBLES, the President
of the Old Parr Khayyam Club, who
has just celebrated his hundred and
third birthday. This gentleman, who is
in the pink of robust health, has never
omitted to have a severe annual attack
of influenza since the emergence of that
alleged malady in 1890. It is, he holds,
a blessing in disguise : it compels one to
go to bed and enables one while there
to clear the system of other disorders.
Such a testimony cannot be too widely
disseminated.
The opening of the burglary season
is always welcome. We now discover
how far our window fastenings and
door bolts are in satisfactory con-
dition; whether or no our servants
can be trusted; and what is the

are cheaply acquired at the expense ol
a little silver, especially when we have
the satisfaction of knowing that some
poor fellows have for a while come

"But how about his meals?"
"Oh, we sends them down a soup-

MARRIAGE AND COOKERY.
["A lawyer named FRANCIS BOTTA has just died
in Qrosswardein, Hungary, leaving his entire
fortune of j£10,000 for the foundation of a
school for cookery, which shall bear hia name.
In his will he says that bad cooking has been
the means of much conjugal unhappiness, and
the object of his legacv is to help to remove
this evil."—Daily ifatZ.J
IN Britain, as in other lands,
We hear of men and women suing
To be released from wedlock's bands,
Repenting of a hasty wooing;—
These tragedies might not have been
If girls were taught la haute cuisine.
A wife who understands her part,
And fashions light and toothsome
dishes,
Would conquer any husband's heart,
And bend him to her lightest
wishes:—
So brides can scarcely overrate
A cookery certificate.
A varied daily bill of fare
Acts as a potent antiseptic,
And heals the temper of the bear
Who rages when he feels dyspeptic;
But wedded bliss soon comes to grief
When mutton alternates with beef.
Hence this intelligence should move
Lone spinsters from their vain repin-
ing;
Not all the means that make for Love
Can match the dearer art of dining;
Nor groundless is the wide repute
Of that old maxim, "Feed the brute!"

will remind some readers of Major MON-

across at the Major and said, " MONSOON,

THE LAST OF THE DURBAR LINERS.
[The S.S. Arabia (Felix ait omen!}, which carries the last batch of
visitors to the Durbar, sailed from the Thames on Friday, December 5.
The following verses are dedicated, with affectionate compliments, to
the author of The Sailing of the Long-Ships.]
THEY heard the sirens singing, they saw the barges rock;
Society (a remnant) stood weeping by the dock;
Away, away, to silence melted the City's roar,
And blasts of briny ozone came whiffling round the Nore.
"I come from various quarters that reek of English fame"
(This was the Blizzard speaking; he knew the sites by
name);
"I noticed all the landmarks, just where they used to be
When your remote forefathers arranged to rule the Sea.
"They sailed with CCEUR DE LION, they ran the old Crusades;
They shipped with Admiral HAWKINS on sundry sporting
raids;
They served with DRAKE of Devon (Devon for wind and
rain!)
And helped themselves unhindered to half the spoils of
Spain.
"They raked Gibraltar's ridges, they shot and burned and
rammed;
They roused the Nile from slumbers long ere the thing was
dammed;
Long ere ye got your highway where JOSEPH'S bark has gone,
They had confirmed the Charter secured by honest 'JOHN.'
"Fair-minded were your fathers, great gentlemen at play,
They never growled in mangers, 'twas not the Sea-dogs' way;
But while they grudged no foeman the stuff they counted
trash,
They fought like fiends for credit, they worked like wolves
for cash.
"Heirs of the valiant Sea-Kings (assembled here on board),
Lo! in their wake ye follow, if not with fire and sword;
Armed with the tiffin-basket, the fine mosquito-net,
Ye still conduct the Empire whose suns refuse to set.
"Your fathers fared in frigates, they went in homely guise,
With 'Victory or the Abbey ' ever before their eyes:
To-day with trunks and trousseaux safely insured ye go,
Pacing in soft apparel upon a P. and 0.
"The Sea-Kings drew their sabres, they dealt the frequent
dint;
Ye too would leave impressions wrought in a rarer mint;
The East, so short of colour, shall fall about your feet
To catch the Carlton manner, the mode of Curzon Street.
"Ye go to see and win her with culture from the West,
To lift the load of languor that lies upon her chest;
Hope not too much! She '11 suffer that temporary strain,
Then turn (a local habit) to 'plunge in thought again.'
"Ye cannot all be JOSEPHS, to do what he would do,
To take and make an old world nearly as good as new;
But ye may share the feelings that lately filled his head
When longing (under hatches) to join the mighty dead.
"So, outward bound or homeward, through scenes ye know
by name,
Observe the panorama that reeks of English fame;
Do note the ancient landmarks just where they used to be
When your sublime forefathers arranged to rule the Sea."

ich habe gewiinscht dass ich hatte ein hussar uniform like
Lieutenant von Hohenegg in the play. My khaki riding-suit
for your manoeuvres, which I thought so dashing and
swagger, looks quite shabby and mean compared to the
other. It 'a simply nowhere. Es ist kein wo.
Glauben Sie der KAISER will machen mich Honorary
Colonel of a Hussar regiment? Ich wiinsche er wiirde.

Wenn Sie konnen thun dieses fur mich, ich werde sein sehr

country, ein von die neue English travelling caps, with a
bulging flat top—a sort of imitation of the German soldier's
cap—which I think quite lovely for civilians, though most
fellows call them beastly ugly. Perhaps they don't suit
ordinary men, but they give me quite a military air; and
I simply adore all German fashions in clothes.
Aber ich bin vergessend was ich wiinschte zu sagen.
Ich bin so sorry dass Sie haben so viel bother over your
Tariff. It seems almost as bad as our Education Bill.

of Hussars. ST. J. B.
DEAR MR. BRODRICK,—I gratulate to the successful accom-
plishment of the educationbill. I also gratulate to your
studies of the german language. You shall be later quite
proficient. I have not the time in order to write a very
long letter. Thanks for your joywishs. This tarifbillbusi-
ness is frightful! Poor BALLESTREM and BUSING are more
troubled as I. They brake their bell in the Reichstag the
other day, trying to overcome the noises.
It rejoice me very that Lord LANSDONNE has made one
mistake. I fear it was not about Shanghai. Unluckily no

ANOTHER "GREAT MISUNDER-
STOOD."
DEAR MR. PUNCH, — My publisher
assures me that, thanks to your kindness
in publishing the prospectus of my
great work on "Canada, her History,
Customs and Resources," the advance
sale of this comfortable book already
exceeds the total sale of all my previous
works. As it is quite apparent that I
have discovered me true method of
writing fascinating books, I am em-
boldened to seek a further favour at
your hands.
This little world is growing a-weary
of higher criticism, and the stupid
belief that prevails in many learned
quarters that descriptive works should
describe facts. At the same time it is
manifestly impossible for us to go back
to the good old days when the pious
editor of the Arminian Magazine pub-
lished accounts of the Upas tree and
similar marvels on the testimony of "a
trustworthy sea-faring man," but we
can secure matter of equal interest by
following my method, and writing not
what is true, but what people believe to
he true.
In this way we should be able to
develop much that would excite the
envy of Baron Munehausen.
following my original policy I pro-
pose to issue a volume on Great Britain,
as she is believed to be by Canadians.
While this will be published in a
manner uniform with my history of
Canada as known to Britons, it will not
be encumbered with unnecessary histori-
cal erudition, but will deal chiefly with
matters of contemporary interest, and I
trust that you will further oblige me by
publishing the following prospectus :—
CHAPTER I.—An introductory essay
dealing with the universally admitted
fact that JULIUS C.ESAR landed in
England B.C. 55, and introduced the
Eastern Question into British Politics.
CHAPTER II.—A diverting account of
how King ALFRED let the cakes burn,
and afterwards established the belief
that Britons never, never, etc.
CHAPTER IH.—A hiatus which em-
braces the author's remaining stock of
historical information regarding the
British Isles.
CHAPTER IV.—A dissertation on the
inhabitants of the British Isles, showing
that they are chiefly characters in poetry
and fiction.
CHAPTER V.—A digression dealing
with the excellent lethal cutlery manu-
factured in England, and brought to
Canada concealed alxnit the persons of
adventurous young gentlemen-farmers
whose mothers have warned them to
beware of wild Indians, bears, buffalos
and other deadly creatures.

SCENE—Street in a Garrison Town.
"WltY DO YOD SQUEEZE TOUR DoLLT 80 TIGHTLY, EFFIE?"
"WELL, YOU SEE, AUNTIE DEAR, MY DOLLY BEGINS TO SPEAK VERY EASILY NOW, AND SHE TALKS
TO PEOPLE A GOOD DEAL. I HAVE TO BE SO VKRl' CABEFIfL IN A PLACE WHERE THERE ABE SO
MANY SOLDIERS ABOUT. On, VERY CAREFUL INDEED!"
CHAPTER VI.—A speculation regarding |
that mysterious body, the Privy Council,
and an appreciation of its value in
manufacturing issues for provincial
elections by deciding disputes between
the Government at Ottawa and the
Governments of the different Provinces.
CHAPTER VLT.—A digression, in which
the author tries to discover a basis for
the solemnity of JOHN BULL; it being
popularly believed in Canada that he
never smiles except when there is an
eclipse of the moon. On these occa-
sions a gentle glow is supposed to light
his face, because he knows that the
phenomenon is largely caused by his
property getting between the sun and
the lesser luminary and casting its
shadow thereon.
CHAPTER Vlil.—Great Britain, as the
home of Princes, who occasionally make
a flying trip through Canada, and leave
behind them a trail of feuds among
aldermen and petty officials regarding
the difficult question of precedence.
CHAPTER IX.—An inquiry into the
foundations of the belief that English-
men owe their remarkable chest develop-
ment to blowing the froth off the best
beer that ever was brewed.
Yours prosperously,
C. A. NUCK.

CHAEIVARIA.
THE London County Council are now
happy. Some of the members were
doubtful whether, from the designs that
were submitted to them for the new
Vauxhall Bridge, they had chosen the
most hideous. Their minds have now
been set at rest by a protest from the
Art World.
It is incorrect to say that the Ad-
miralty are building two more third-
rate cruisers; they are, of course, third-
class.
By the by, we believe the general
public is under the impression that
there are only two sorts of cruisers—
first-class cruisers to carry the officers,
and third-class cruisers for the men.
An excellent innovation is about to
be introduced by the Admiralty. The
stability of a torpedo-boat destroyer is
to be tested without a crew inside her.
Belgium has one public-house for
every thirty-eight inhabitants. This,
perhaps, explains why Belgium is the
most densely populated country in
Europe.
Practice makes perfect, and we are
improving in our accidents. They
show a distinct tendency to be better
managed. Last week an antiquated
muzzle-loader was blown to pieces
through the explosion of a shell at
Lydd camp, without a single person
being killed.
And the War Office, who manufactured
the shell, are not a little proud that it
exploded.
Mr. WYNDHAM has declared, in reply
to a correspondent, that no Irish M.P.,
since he has been in prison, has been
set to do laundry work. The sensitive
Celts now smell an insult in this. They
allege that in stating that the Irish
"won't wash clothes, Mr. WYNDHAM
had in mind a certain well-known
advertisement.
Mr. HALL CAINE has sailed for England.
"The Eternal City" is drawing Large
audiences in New York, and Mr. CAINE
has secured commissions for a new novel,
and a new play. He has also expressed
his profound conviction that America
has a great future before it.
Great enthusiasm was aroused by the
statement in the daily papers that " the
Good Hope passed Gibraltar without
touching." Coming at the same time
as a report that an American liner
had passed the Isle of Wight without
hitting it, the public was largely com-
pensated for the rumour that a Liverpool
boat had grazed the Calf of Man, and
another had knocked Scilly.
The Daily Mail has been protesting
against the large foreign element of the
Cobden Club. It is therefore gratifying
to hear a report that the next President
is to be a Mr. JOHANN BUHL.
AIDS FOR AUTHORS.
(Being a few suggestions for intending novelists
who are otherwise thoroughly equipped for
the profession of letters, but happen not to
ham any initial ideas.)
I.—WAS HE BI.ACK OR WHITE?
(Complex character sketch.)
HERO handsome, peculiarly attractive
by reason of melancholy. Has poisoned
two uncles, broken three widows' hearts,
robbed four orphans, shut five female
relatives in asylums, but bursts into
tears at sound of great organ rolling in
cathedral aisles, and, touched at sight
of a Simple Girl dressed in white
muslin and wearing a single string of
pearls, he awakens to the longing for
better things, and sees that as Humanity
is inherently noble, he is a fine fellow
after all.
II.—A MONARCH MISJUDGED; OR, OUR
SOVEREIGN JOHN OF BLESSED MEMORY
IN A NEW LIGHT.
(A historical romance.)
Character sketch of King JOHN, the
heroic soul who saw the far-off ideal of
the modern English constitution. His
passion for the liberty of his people,
hence noble determination to act the
Wicked Despot that he might spur his
subjects to win the Charter. Fine
conception, cruelly misunderstood by
his age. His death unwept. Intro-
duce as villain STEPHEN LANOTON. Show
JOHN'S passionate love for ARTHUR; how,
nevertheless, convinced that in ARTHUR
he saw a future tyrant over the English
people, he nobly murdered the boy in
whom his soul delighted. A splendid
crime! One child dying pro bono
publico. (To le continued.)

[" I think you must sometimes envy the lot
of those happy people who lived at a time
when it was within the capacity of any single
individual to master without any undue effon
the whole compass of human learning and oi
human wisdom."—Mr. A. J. Balfour.]
0 FOR the days of long ago,
Of blessed old B. C.,
When it was possible to know
The omne scibile,
When all in everything excelled,
Nor specialised at college,
And one small cerebellum held
The sum of human knowledge.
There were no libraries as yet
Of huge ungainly size
For students emulous to get
The wisdom of the wise;
You did not gaze on rows and rows
Of volumes, half-demented,
For poetry was rare, and prose
Had hardly been invented.
Philosophy was simple: men
Had not begun to rant
About their apperception then
And transcendental cant.
They knew what souls were made of,
too,
For in those days so distant
No metaphysics worried you,
For they were non-existent.
Then language was a problem small
In golden long ago:
You talked in Greek, and that was all
There really was to know.
Linguistic incapacity
Itself could then deter none
From learning modern tongues, you
see,
Because, of course, there were none.
As for geography, a chap
Had only got to see
ANAXIMANDER'S little map,
And none knew more than he.
You knew what history there was,
And law and medicine. Many
Knew all the sciences, because,
You see, they hadn't any.

will probably beware of his contributor
in future, remembering him as "Sir

way, the title of Mr. KNOWLES'S Magazine
lias been a puzzle to us ever since its
adoption. The Nineteenth Century—and

IT was a blithe New Zealander,
Stalwart and straight and tanned,
Had travelled o'er the salt sea foam
To see his motherland.
He tarried not an instant,
He sped to London town,
He hired a guide and gaily cried,
"Come show me up and down!"
"Good Sir," replied the courteous guide,
"You have but to declare
What 'tis your chiefest wish to see,
And I will take you there."
"Oh, show me then," the stranger cried,
The War Office, Pall Mall."
"Alas," replied the gentle guide,
"'Tis now a smart hotel."
"Alackaday!" the stranger said,
"That I was born so late.
Then pilot me unto the Tower
To see the Traitors' Gate."
"It grieves me sore," the other said,
"Your ardent hopes to quell.
That edifice is also turned
Into a new hotel."
'' Indeed ?'' exclaimed the stricken youth,
Losing his ruddy tint;
"If I may not behold the Tower,
Then take me to the Mint."
"There is no Mint;," the answer came,
"There are no beaver hats:
The site is wholly occupied
By residential flats."
"Westminster Abbey, what of that ?"—
"Good Sir, you surely know
That MORGAN carted it away
To Boston, years ago."
"Then take me to the Mansion House"—
The answer, like a knell,
Once more was uttered by the guide —
"That's also an hotel."
It was a triste New Zealander
That hied him to the shore,
And thus in burning words appeased
His indignation sore:
"I came to see your storied piles,
Your fanes and citadels;
I find them all replaced by flats,
Or turned intoliotels."

THE following items are taken from a
list of railway schemes which, in view
of the success that has recently attended
the efforts of various promoters of
tube railways, are, we understand,
about to be submitted to the House of
Commons.
XTTT.—A scheme to form, at some point
not yet determined, a junction
between the Campbell and Banner-
man Railway and the Rosebery
Overhead Light Railway.
The C. & B. R. connects, by a some-
what circuitous route, the two important
industrial centres, Campbell and Banner-
man, at which places are termini. The
R. 0. L. R. has no terminus, its lines
forming a circle which frequently crosses
the C. & B. R.'s permanent way. The
object of the proposed junction is to
facilitate the passage of through Parlia-
mentary trains from either Bannennan
or Campbell to places in the elevated
Rosebery Circle, or the reverse, and if
the scheme should prove profitable it is
not unlikely that at some future date
the two Companies may amalgamate.
XCVI.—The Cowes, Atlantic, and New
York Underground Railway.
This line, which will be used almost
entirely for goods traffic, is to be con-
structed to meet the needs of sportsmen
who wish to convey racing-yachts to
New York. Sir THOMAS LIPTON, Chair-
man of the Company, announced at a
preliminary meeting of directors that
the two powerful pioneer engines,
Hamrock and Jamroclt, both guaranteed
to carry all before them, would make
trial journeys on the completed line
next year. The American terminus, he
said, would be fitted with elevators
specially constructed with a view to
lifting cups. In reply to a question he
remarked wittily that the new line
should form a kind of cupling link
between the two nations.

serves impressively, nudging me in the
ribs, "if they weigh an ounce."
"More than that, I should think," I
remark as I remove my foot.
"D' yer think so?" he exclaims joy-
fully. "They 're all right, they are.
'Arf a dozen of "em."
I apply myself again to my news-
paper. My neighbour picks up the
carpet-bag, and, nudging me in the ribs
again, places the handle in my hand.
"Feel 'em," he enjoins; "feel the
weight of "em."
"I have done that already," I ven-
ture to remark, but am forced to accede
to his request.
I again attempt to turn my attention
to my paper.
"'Arf a dozen of 'em," he repeats,
with another nudge. "The best that
money can buy."
I fold up my paper with resignation.
"What are they?" I inquire.
My companion leans towards me with
delight.
"Furry "uns," he replies.
"Fur ?" I murmur vaguely.
"Furry "uns," he repeats, slapping
his thigh,—" Rats."
My boredom immediately gives way to
keener emotions. I venture to ask if
they are alive. My neighbour chuckles
gleefully.
"Notarf," he replies. "They're all
right, they are. They 're for my terrier
up at Fulham. Big 'uns. Feel "em."
I nervously remind him that I have
already felt em. He beams at me.
"We won't arf 'ave a time to-night,"
he says, "in my back garding. Would
yer like to 'ave a look at 'em?"
I hastily disclaim any such desire.
He does not seem to be convinced of my
sincerity.
"I 'd show 'em to yer willing," he
assures me, "only yer know they might
get out. Yer see I ain't used to 'em."
"I wouldn't have you run any risk
on my account," I inform him earnestly.
He appears to be the prey of self-
reproach.
•'Yer don't think," he aska appeal-
ingly, " that I don't leant ter show 'em
to yer?"
"I am certain," I assure him, "that
you would be only too ready."
My obvious sincerity seems this time
to carry conviction. He gazes round
the bus, beaming.

CHRISTMAS CARD TYPES.
"Reg'lar beauties," he says loudly—
"the best that money can buy. Furry
'uns."
He fails to attract attention, and for a
time is silent. Suddenly he picks up
the carpet-bag, and nudging in the back
an old gentleman on the seat in front,
lowers the carpet-bag over his shoulder.
"Feel the weight of "em," he admon-
ishes—" the furry 'uns."
The old gentleman turns round and
glares at him, then waves the bag away
without a word. My neighbour, nothing
discouraged, gets up and begins to roam
with his bag about the top of the bus,
nudging people on the shoulder and
asking them to "feel 'em." He meets
with continual repulses until he reaches
an elderly lady on the other side, who
opens her purse and produces her ticket.
My friend holds the carpet-bag in front
of her.
"Feel "em," he entreats.
"What do you want?" she inquires
in surprise.
"Feel "em," he repeats, dangling the
bag in front of her face; "feel the
weight of 'em, the beauties."
"What are they?" she queries
nervously.
"Furry 'uns," he responds,—" reg'lar
big 'uns.—Rats."
The elderly lady emits a stifled scream,
and shrinks to the other side of the seat.
"Take them away !" she gasps.
"Don't be frightened of 'em, Missus,"
he says encouragingly; "they 're the
best that money can buy—feel "em."
"Take them away !" cries the elderly
lady.
My friend lowers the bag, and regards
her with contemptuous amusement.
"You wouldn't never do ter take
a-ferretin'," he observes.
"Go away!" cries the lady. "Take
that bag away!"
My friend slowly retires towards bis
seat again.
"There ain't no call ter be afraid of
"em," he observes, beginning to rum-
mage in his overcoat pocket. "I ain't
afraid of 'em. Why I "ve got a little
'un in my pocket 'ere"
Suddenly he breaks off.
"'Ere—ullo!" he exclaims, "where
is 'e? I 'ad 'im all right when I got
on the bus"
"Driver!" cries the elderly lady.
"Stop! I want to get off."
Which as the bus slows down she
does with astonishing agility.
My friend has resumed his seat, and
is still rummaging in his pockets.
"That's a peculiar thing," he ob-
serves.
I notice a prevalent atmosphere of
uneasiness on the bus. A small girl
near the front is attempting the task of
sitting on her feet without attracting
attention. I personally am conscious of
unpleasant sensations in the spine. My
neighbour gets up, still holding his
bag, and begins to poke about under
the seats. At last he arrives at the
front seat, where a buxom young lady
is leaning forward in intimate con-
versation with the driver.
"'Ere, Miss," observes my friend,
nudging her with the carpet-bag,
"d' you mind movin' your skirt?"
The girl turns round in surprise, then
prepares to do what he asks.
"Ullo, ullo, wot's the trouble?"
queries the driver, looking round.
"I've bin," he explains, "an' lorst
one o' my rats."
The buxom young lady gives one eai^-
splitting shriek and leaps upon the

seat. My friend only just saves her
from instant death by throwing his arm
round her waist.
"There ain't no call ter be afraid,
GERTIE," he observes, dangling the
carpet-bag in front of her. ".Why,
I 've got a bag full of 'em 'ere."
"Take him away from me!" screams
the girl, pulling his arm from round
her waist. "Let me get off!"
The driver has stopped the bus.
"Look 'ere, ole man," he says with
heat, "you 'd better get orf. We don't
want no bloomin' rats on 'ere."
There is a murmur of assent from
everybody. The conductor has just
appeared at the top of the steps. He
sees my friend and makes towards him.
"Ullo, it's you, is it ?" he exclaims.
"I Ve 'ad a complint abaht you already.
Come on, orf yer get."
"I ain't goin' ter get orf," retorts
my friend. "I 'm lookin" fer one o'
my rats."
"'E's boozed, thet's wot's the
matter with "im," remarks the driver.
"Come on!" says the conductor,
"I 've 'ad a lidy complinin' abaht you
already."
My friend puts down his carpet-bag.
"I ain't goin' ter get orf," he says
firmly. "I'm goin' ter look fer my
rat. I 've lorst "im."
"Put 'im an' 'is bloomin' rats in the
road," suggests the driver, "an" let 'im
play with "em."
The conductor BO far acts upon this
hint as to pick up the carpet-bag.
"You come on orf," he says, moving
with it towards the steps.
My friend makes a dart after him and
seizes the bag. There is a sudden
click, and in an instant the top of the
hus is inundated with live rats, which
swarm over the roof or fall down the
sides into the road.
Astampede ensues, everybody fighting
for the steps. One young man only,
standing upon a seat and folding his
arms, shouts above the din to "let the
women and children go first." In a
minute the bus is absolutely empty,
even to the driver who has clambered
down from his box into the road.
The adjacent public-houses have
emitted streams of sight-seers. A
sporting policeman stops the traffic
while the dogs of the neighbourhood
enjoy a brief taste of Paradise. One of
them is sent tip the steps on to the bus.
In five minutes there are as many rat-
corpses in the street.
At last the conductor reconnoitres on
top of the bus and pronounces it safe.
The few remaining passengers climb
up and gingerly resume their seats.
The driver has clambered up to his box
again, and with difficulty induced the
buxom young lady to follow up the
steps. My friend, surrounded by a

crowd of urchins, is sitting disconso-
lately on the kerb, gazing at a little
heap of five corpses, which he has
gathered together before him. The
driver leans over from his box.
"There's yer bloomin' rats," he
calls, as he whips up his horses. "Now
you 'd better take 'em 'ome an' 'ave
'em fer supper."
The bus moves on. My friend has
not answered, or even raised his eyes.
He stretches out his hand mechanically,
and begins sadly to put the corpses
back in his empty carpet-bag.

TECHNICAL EDUCATION.
(What tee are coining to.)
"I *VE GOT A REALLY EXCELLENT~C'OOK, NOW. SHE DEVELOPS ALL MY PHOTOS FOR ME!"
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF "LITERARY
LANDMARKS."
ON Monday last a largely-attended
meeting of the Society of Spasmodic
Fiction-Writers was held for the pur-
pose of protesting against the action of
Mr. H. E. Moss and other gentlemen in
their proposal to erect in Vigo Street a
house of entertainment to he known as
the " Coliseum."
The Chairman, in opening the debate,
stated that from time immemorial the
name "Coliseum" had been the abso-
lute property of contributors of sterling
fictitious matter to journals ranging in
price from one penny to sixpence. So
far as his recollection served he had
never read, and most certainly had
never written, any short story or novel
treating of the drama in which the
theatre therein introduced had not been
called the " Coliseum." It would be a
task of the very utmost magnitude for
fiction-writers to evolve a new playhouse
patronymic; for all of which reasons he
unhesitatingly condemned Mr. H. E.
Moss's action as a heartless theft. He
therefore proposed that the following
resolution be passed and forwarded to
Mr. Moss:—
"That this meeting of the Society of
Spasmodic Fiction-Writers does most
strongly protest against Mr. H. E. Moss's
action in entitling his new house of
entertainment the 'Coliseum,' which it
considers is a base infringement of the
Unwritten Laws of Copyright." Mr.
KEATS SWINBURNE-JONES rose to lend his
cordial approval to the resolution. His
own forte, as was well known, was the
struggling young actor who gets his
chance at a theatre in the last 1,000
words and, at one blow, creates an
epoch in the history of the drama, and
places himself in a position to marry
the heroine. He had written one hun-
dred and fifteen stories on this theme,
and in every single instance the house
in question had been named the
"Coliseum," indeed he knew of nothing
else which it could be named.
Mr. ANTHONY W. \V. BINNS stated that
this was the thin end of the wedge.
(Applause.) He clearly foresaw that if
Mr. Moss was permitted to succeed in
his dastardly "slim commandeering,"
his action would immediately be followed
by Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES or Mr. LOWEN-
FELD building a "Frivolity Theatre."
(Profound sensation.) What the
"Coliseum" was to the previous speaker
and numberless others, the " Frivolity"
waa to himself and many hundreds
more whose stories treated of light, or
musical comedy actress - heroines, or
chorus adventuresses; these always
worked at the "Frivolity Theatre."
Fiction - writers had invented the
"Coliseum" and the "Frivolity," and
naturally knew of no other possible
appellations. If one was taken from
them the otherwould speedily follow, and
what would they do then? (Sensation.)
The Chairman announced that the
question was unanswerable, and declared
the motion to be uproariously carried.
Order having been restored by a District
Messenger boy, the resolution was typed,
and the entire company adjourned with
it to the Hippodrome.
Later in the day it was rumoured
that Mr. Moss was lying in the Manager's
room in a precarious condition.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIART or TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Dec. 1.—
Years ago, when the Access to Moun-
tains Bill, in charge of that famous
Alpine climber, JAMES BRYCE, was to the
fore, Dr. FARQUHARSON created profound
sensation by casually remarking, " I own
a mountain in Scotland."
For a moment dazed Members, regard-
ing the good Doctor standing at the
Valentine and Orson, separated by the
combined machinations of a hungry
bear and an iniquitous uncle, nothing
compared with the anguish that rent
the bosoms of CATHCART and EUGENE.
In the spring of this year, when a
young man's fancy lightly turns to
thoughts of love, fraternal or otherwise,
they swore a mighty oath (six feet four
and a half) that they would no longer
endure separation. Difficulty was to
\ decide how the distance was to be

ROPED TOOETHEU.
Dr. F-rq-h-rs-n, Mr. E-g-ne W-a-n, and (round the corner) Mr. C-thc-rt W-g-n.
bar this afternoon, thought he had
brought it clown to the House with him.
Nay, there were two mountains. On
closer investigation the acclivities turned
out to be CATHCART WASON, re-elected
for Orkney and Caithness, and his
brother EUGENE, Member for Clack-
mannan. Measured from the sea level,
CATHCART is six feet four and a half
near the firmament. As stars differ in
glory, EUOKNE is six feet four and a
quarter. This is the only difference
between the brothers. When it comes
to bulk and brains they are twins.
On being first returned to Parliament
they, with national canniness, divided
their forces. One seated himself on the
Ministerial side, t'other with the Opposi-
tion. Thus, however things fell out,
the family certain to lie represented on
the right side. As the months passed,
EUGENE sat sadly regarding CATHCART as
one in a far country. CATHCART, through
dimmed eyesight that made EUGENE
loom larger than ever, forlornly watched
his brother across the waste. Situation
began to be unbearable. The dolour of
bridged. The MEMBER FOR SARK, usually
well informed on details, tells me they
resolved to toss up whether EUGENE
should cross over and link his arm in
CATHCART'S, or whether CATHCART, shak-
ing the dust of Unionism off his shoes,
should flit to the side of Brother
EUGENE. However it be, as all the
world knows, CATHCART applied for the
Chiltern Hundreds, presented himself
for re-election under Liberal flag, and
to-day comes back, bringing his sheaves
with him in the form of a largely
increased majority.
So to-night Brother EUGENE, with the
assistance of FARQUHARSON, who though
not personally a mountain lives near
one, brought the new Member up to the
Table to take the oath and sign roll
of Parliament. FARQUHARSON, with his
active mountaineering habits, strode
nearly a pace ahead of the new Member,
recalling the familiar picture daily seen
in the Channel, of a small tug-boat
hauling, against wind and tide, a full-
rigged ship.
Business done.—New Rules of Pro-
cedure passed in the Spring made
Standing Orders.
Tuesday night.—Pretty to see the
Right Hon. JEMMY PARTINGTON LOWTHER
tanding at his corner seat below Gang-
way sweeping back the advancing wave
of National Education. Education Bill
on for third reading. J. PARTINGTON
LOWTHER moved its rejection.
"Drat your schools!" he cried, turn-
ng what he meant to be a glowering
[ace on PRINCE ARTHUR.
But JEMMY cannot, even under painful
circumstances of the hour, look other-
wise than a genial, kind-hearted country
squire, his manners, and his clothes, cut
in London. Even as he turns upon the
PREMIER his countenance mellows with
memories of good old times. Not old
as far as health, appetite, and disposi-
tion to be cheerful go, he yet remembers
pre-Board School times, when Education
in national schools was limited to the
three R's, and those writ small. It
wouldn't do to put it that way, but
actually, the principal, at least the most
useful, purpose of the old school house
was to establish a rendezvous where boys
could be found handy if wanted to beat
up game. Concurrently they learned
enough to fit them for the position of
gardeners, game-keepers, stable men,
coachmen, even butlers. As for the
girls, they had comfortable openings as
kitchenmaids, nurses, cooks, housemaids,
with the prize of tenancy of the house-
keeper's room ever before them. Now
amid talk of Germany, with its severely
educated population, beating us out of
the markets of the world, and rot like
that, not only are hundreds of thousands
of boys who would have made excellent
stable hands, and an equal number of
girls whom Providence obviously de-
signed for the kitchen or the laundry,
spoiled for their work, but squires and
landed gentry of all degrees are called
upon to pay money out of their hardly-
earned rents in order to meet the
charges.
"I have always protested," said
JEMMY, in one of those finely-rounded
sentences that are the despair of the
newer Parliamentary generation,"against
giving one class of persons other
people's money to spend.
PRINCE ARTHUR, smilingly listening
from the Treasury Bench, here became
suddenly grave and moved uneasily on
his seat. What was JEMMY driving at
now? PRINCE ARTHUR painfully con-
scious of certain doles to bestowal of
which he has, since coining into office,
been a principal party. There was the
landlord's dole; but since the stern
critic below the Gangway himself
belonged to that set it couldn't be it he
was lamenting. Then there was the
dole to the parson. But a steady church-
goer like JEMMY, a munificent subscriber

to ecclesiastical edifices at Epsom and
Newmarket, wouldn't resent that.
Again, the Bill before the House was
giving to one class of persons (the
managers of denominational schools)

i • Newmarket."
(Mr. J-mmy L-wth-r.)
a capital sum of many millions of other
people's money to spend.
Nor was it this that troubled the
magisterial mind below the Gangway.
It was just the altogether foolishness of
this modern mania of teaching village
school children more than the three R s.
Why GURTH, swineherd and thrall of
CEDRIO of Rotherwood, never even heard
of them!
Having delivered his speech J.PARTINQ-
TON LOWTHER, with an almost vicious
swish at the steadily advancing tide,
swung his mop on his shoulders and
stalked forth.
Business done. — Third Reading of
Education Bill moved.
Friday night.—Picking up just now a
little book published by FISHER UNWIN en-
titled For Better? For Worse? and noting
that the author was GEORGE ROSSELL
experienced sudden shock. Could it be
possible that an old austere bachelor
friend had, after all these years, gone
and got married, and in the excitement
of unfamiliar circumstances was inaccu-
rately quoting the Marriage Service?
On closer inspection relieved to find
that the title indicated nothing worse
than notes on social changes. Born as
recently as 1853, a mere chicken as
age is counted in political and Parlia-
mentary life, GEORGE RUSSELL delights
to pose as a modern Methuselah. Never
so thoroughly happy as when, taking
pen in hand, he looks back through
the dim ages, recalling his personal
memories of Queen ANNE and the time
of GEORGE I.
"I am just old enough," he mumbles,
after the manner of a man whose teeth
have their roots in the seventeenth
century, "to remember a great grand-
mother who said she 'lay' at a place
when she meant she had slept there,
and spoke of 'using the potticary'
when we should speak of sending for
the doctor."
Going even further back, METHUSELAH
RUSSELL well remembers how SETH
always said "Toosday" for Tuesday,
"dook" for duke, "fust" for first;
how JARED spoke of "goold " when he
meant gold, knew a colour he pro-
nounced "yaller," spoke of lilac as a
"laylock," and was kept in countenance
by LAMECH, who always called a cucum-
ber a " cowcumber."
A pretty affectation, leading to pleasant
reading, reminiscent of conversation on
summer afternoons at the Swean Gate,
where sat the seniors of the Trojan race,
wise through time and narrative with age.
G. W. E. R. is not really so old as he
writes. But he has certainly lived long
enough to be the last of the Whigs pur
sang. With native originality he adds
to the rare character a touch of Radi-
calism.
I may timidly mention that I am just
old enough to remember the then
Member for AYLESBUHY rising from below
Gangway of House of Commons and
making striking speech. It was in the
early turbulent days of GLADSTONE'S
second Administration. The Premier
had made some reference to GEORGE
RUSSELL, at the moment absent. Brought
in and told what had happened, he
made bright acrimonious response, justi-
fying independence of a Radical
Member. Natural consequence followed.
At first opportunity Mr. G. brought
him into the Ministry, reinstating him
when, in 1892, he again came into
power. Stranded at the General Election
of 1895, he has never since attempted to
steer his barque by Westminster Bridge.
He writes charming books, but we have
need of such as he in the House of
Commons. Apart from personal merit,
in this individual case conspicuous, we
should always have a Woburn Abbey
RUSSELL in the House of Commons.
The development that just now adorns
the House of Lords is another pair of
sleeves.
Business done.—The Lords read
Education Bill a second time.
UNDER THE MISTLETOE BOUGH.
(New and American Version.)
[According to the Daily Telegraph of Decem-
ber 3, the following Bill has been introduced
into the Legislature of Virginia by a Dr. R. B.
WAEE :—" Whereas kissing has been decided
by the medical profession to be a medium by
which contagious and infectious diseases are
transmitted from one person to another; and
whereas the prohibiting of such offence will be
a great preventive to the spreading of such
diseases as pulmonary tuberculosis, diphtheria,
and many other dangerous diseases, therefore
be it enacted by the General Assembly of Vir-
ginia that it shall be unlawful for any person
to kiss another unless he can prove by his
family physician that he has not any contagious
or infectious disease."]

HOW TO GET ON.
No. IV.—IN SOCIETY.
(Continued.)
I DON'T quite know why HILARY JOWETT came amongst tis.
One of the houses at the north end of the Avenue had been
for some time without a tenant. The board announcing that
it was to be let had seemed something of a reproach to the
neighbourhood. Houses usually passed from hand to hand
without an interval, and we didn't relish the emptiness of
Aberdeen Lodge. Suddenly, however, the board disappeared,
and we learnt that the new tenant was HILARY JOWETT.
Ther? was also a Mrs. JOWETT, a pale lady with a wiped-out
face, and there were two children, ADOLPHUS HILARY, aged
six, and CLEMENTINA, aged four. The new arrivals were a
good deal talked about, but very little was discovered. It
was rumoured that they were rich and well-connected, and
the calls began. It was then reported that Mrs. JOWETT was
quite a lady-like person of sound domestic views, and we
were encouraged by our womankind to proceed further in
the path of intimacy. The HOBSONS gave them the first
dinner-party, and nearly all the members of our local
aristocracy, the meille roehe of Glen-Edward's Avenue, were
present. We all took a good deal of interest in the new-
comers, and we were anxious to discover how far they might
be looked upon as acquisitions to our circle. HOBSON'S dinner,
I 'm bound to say, was tip-top. He gave us turtle-soup
(GUKTER'S best), salmon, two different entries (one was a
sweet-bread, of course), a saddle of mutton and a capon,
roast pheasants, cabinet pudding and jelly, and those jolly
little cream cakes that Mrs. BROADBENT, the confectioner,
made better than any one else I can remember. I 've got
the old menu before me as I write: I always used to pocket
them before Mr. ROGERS, the local butler, was able to sweep
it away with the bread crumbs before dessert. HOBSON'S
wine, too, was excellent. Sherry to start with, then hock,
then claret and champagne (nothing like so dry as we have
to drink it now), and then port and a different claret to go
round after the ladies had departed.
However, we weren't thinking much about the quality of
the dinner: we could always take that on trust at HOBSON'S.
We were all watching the JOWETTS. Mrs. JOWETT was very
quiet. HOBSON'S best stories didn't seem to rouse her, though,
of course, she smiled—but it was a mournful watery kind
of smile, without much substance to back it. HILARY JOWETT,
on the other hand, did extremely well. He was soon deep
in conversation with Mrs. HOBSON, and seemed to get on like
a house on fire, occasionally turning round and drawing
Mrs. BAILEY, the wife of Dr. BAILEY, Headmaster of the
Grammar School, into the conversation. Once the general
conversation sank down and dropped, but JOWETT still went
on, and we all heard him. "Of course," he was saying,
"dear Lady MABEL isn't exactly the model of refinement
and good manners. I quite agree with you there, Mrs.
HOBSON; but still there 'a a something about her—I can't

HOBSON tentatively. "Yes," continued JOWETT, "that's
it exactly—a je ne saia quoi—that makes you feel she has
lived in good society, and is a Duke's daughter after all. I
admit her mother is greatly superior to her, in spite of her
age. 'Duchess,' I said to her only last week—' Duchess,
how is it that "but here the talk swelled up again at
the other end of the table, and we lost the end of JOWETT'S
remark to the Duchess.
Still, there was the fact: he knew a Duchess, and was
sufficiently sure of himself to criticise the manners of a
Duchess's daughter! The surprising part of it all, though,
was his saying he agreed with Mrs. HOBSON about Lady
MABEL. She didn't know Lady MABKL CORNFLOWER from Eve

MAKE ONE LOOK SO PLAIN AND ELDERLY!"
—we were all sure of that. Yet she must have ventured
an opinion from which knowledge was to be presumed.
HOBSON himself had looked uncomfortable, and GREENWAY,
a Radical, but not a bad fellow, had given a sort of sniffing
cough; but there for the time the matter ended. Over the
wine after dinner JOWETT went on expounding. He spoke
of Earls by their nicknames; he told a facetious and deroga-
tory anecdote about a Prince—a German Prince, to be sure,
but still a Prince; he knew and retailed to us some very
choice scandal about a Marchioness: "I had it," he said,
"straight from DICKIE GARRAWAY, and if he doesn't know,
all I can say is he ought to. Poor old DICKIE, what a wreck
he is, though he still keeps his hair wonderfully. I haven't
seen him very lately—have you ?'' This was to TOM TRANTEB,
who murmured, "No—er—that is to say, no, not very
lately," and proceeded to ask JOWETT whether there was any
truth in the rumour that Lord BEMBRIDGE and his wife were
not on speaking terms. "Lord BEIIBRIDGE?" returned
JOWETT, as though taxing his memory. "Oh, of course,
DICKIE GARRAWAY, you mean. He was DICKIE G. for so long
before he succeeded to the title that he 's generally known
by his old name. He and his wife! Ha! ha! Why, thev
haven't met for five years." This was a poser, but we afl
thought it served TOM right for presumption. Shortly
afterwards we joined the ladies.
I mustn't linger over the melancholy story. The JOWETTS
had a great success, naturally, and we all felt somehow that
we had gone up in the social scale, about which none of
us had ever thought before. And yet we felt, too, that we
had gone down in our own estimation. JOWETT knew so
many big-wigs, and it seemed so easy for him to talk
about them, that our simple primitiveness became a positive
reproach to us. The Happy Evenings were deserted; the
Book and Magazine Club was neglected, and HOBSOH
began (o talk of going to a Lev^e and having Mrs. H.

presented at a Drawing Eoom. I 've
no doubt he would have done it too,
for I know he bought a Court suit,
cocked hat, knee breeches, silk stock-
ings, shoes, buckles, sword and all, and
JOWETT promised that he and his wife
would see them through, when suddenly
the bubble burst. The JOWETTS went
away for the summer holidays and
never came back. All the bills were
paid, everything was in order, but 'ToM
TRANTER discovered that JOWEIT was a
retired hair-dresser who had had a
flourishing shop in the west end of
London, under another name. Hence
his intimacy with the great and titled.
This happened a year after that first
dinner-party at HOBSON'S. The shock
was too great. Glen-Edward's Avenue
never held up its head again. The
simple spell that had kept us together
had been broken, and not long after-
wards most of us betook ourselves with
the shattered relics of our simplicity
and a copy of Burke'a Peerage to
different quarters of London. We
rarely meet now. I saw HOBSON the
other day, and asked him if he had
worn his Court suit lately. I was half
afraid he might resent the allusion, but
he didn't. He only sighed and turned
away.
(To "be concluded.)
THE DURBAE.
By a Peer's Daughter.
[The following descriptive article has already
reached Mr. Punch's offices. The error was
obvious, and he at once gave orders for its
redirection to the right quarter.]
THE Durbar was a wonderful sight—
for those who saw it, at all events. The
magnificent display of jewels and orders,
the richness of colour of the Native
Princes, the glitter of the hundreds of
eves of the military, and the kaleido-
scope of brilliant tints worn by the
ladies, formed a never-to-be-forgotten
picture. And then there were the
elephants. Never were so many ele-
phants gathered together before, not
even at Barnum's. Many well-known
faces were seen there, and nearly all
seemed to find it hot. In fact, anyone
who goes to India will find that is the
general complaint there. Lord CDRZON,
however, was cool, as always, and
especially so to a party of rich Ameri-
cans who wished to shake hands with
him. All remarked how well the
VICEREINE looked, and her marvellous
confections impressed even the haughty
and gaudy Orientals. The ever-popular
Duke of CONNAUGHT bore himself right
royally, and his likeness to other
members of the Royal Family was
noticed even by those who had never
seen any of them. Lord KITCHENER, it

need scarcely be said, was as imper-
turbable and silent as ever, except
when trodden on inadvertently by an
elephant; and even then his Lordship
only spoke one word.
Altogether the great event may be
said to have passed off with scarcely a
hitch, which was largely due to, the
prohibition of motor-cars. If one were
hypercritical, something might be said
about the rendering of the National
Anthem. Some of the bandsmen cer-
tainly had not the wonderful power
they once had, and, if they played as
deliciously as ever, they certainly played
no better. It only remains to say that
everyone who was anyone seemed to be
at the Durbar. In a word, .it was a
scene of gorgeous magnificence, the like
of which we have never seen.
THAT excitable ecclesiastic controver-
sialist Sir HENRY HOWOETH, who is per-
petually breaking out in a fresh column
of the Times, thinks that a certain Mr.
LEEPER (whom he apparently considers
a person to be avoided, as though he
spelt the first syllable of his name with
only one "e") ought not to remain
where he is as an Anglican. Does he
want Mr. LEEPER to become a Jumper?
"The Eternal City!" as the Stock-
broker's old clerk exclaimed on arriving
at the office 10 A.M. on a foggy morning.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IF Lady BLESSINGTON were still with us she would look
with amazement, not untinctured by envy, upon The Book
of Beauty, a magnificent volume Messrs. HUTCHINSON have
prepared in commemoration of the Coronation of King
EDWARD TOE SEVENTH. The Countess edited her Books of
Beauty; not one approaches comparison with the work
accomplished by her successor in the field, Mrs. F. H.
WILLIAMSON, who has arranged this rare specimen. One
peculiarity of the undertaking is that, whilst there are
fifty full-page and many smaller photogravure portraits
of the most beautiful and distinguisheof women of the
day, there are no reproductions from photographs. Each
illustration, the work of an eminent Paris firm of engravers,
is taken direct from a portrait by one or other of the greatest
painters of yesterday and to-day. The result is a dream of
fair women not exceeded in beauty by the memorable one
feigned by TENNYSON'S fancy. The literary matter, con-
tributed by men and women of note, is printed on hand-
made paper specially manufactured. In all respects it
forms a worthy and unique memorial of a historic event.
Like its predecessor, a collection of portraits of the celebrities
of the Court during the latter years of Queen VICTORIA'S
reign (which book-collectors know is to-day at a considerable
premium), the work is appropriately published on the
subscription principle in vogue with Lady BLESSINGTON.
To "sportsmen" Dead Certainties, by "NATHANIEL Gun-
BIN8 " (.JOHN LONO), will be probably interesting or amusing.
By the ordinary reader the majority of the stories will be
found decidedly amusing, the minority a trifle puzzling.
As a stirring story of true adventure for the boy who
appreciates his history and heroes up-to-date my premiere
Baronitess heartily recommends With Kitchener in the
Soudan, by G. A. HENTY (BLACKIE AND SON, Ltd.). The
interest never flags from the moment the disinherited young
man makes his start from Alexandria till he is safely home
again. This is almost the last of the works that HENTY so
loved to write, and his boyish admirers were so delighted to
read. Also from the same firm comes The Fairclough Family,
by Mrs. HENRY CLARK. A little sentiment, a touch of secret
mystery, and wedding bells at finish. It just sufficiently
reaches the borderland of a novel to gratify the "maiden
of blushing fifteen." It is well illustrated by G. DEMAIN
HAMMOND, R.I.
His Majesty Baby and Some Common People (HODDER AND
STOUGHTON), introduced by L\N MACLAREN, turn out to be a
charming company. They are what the wise would call
slight sketches. But they are touched in with the swift
movement, the accuracy, and the daintiness of colour that
mark the master hand. The sketch that gives its name to
the volume is based on nothing more than the casual coming
across a baby in charge of its mother in a bus. In its
literary style my Baronite recognises touches worthy of
DICKENS, rarer still, of CHARLES LAMB. Another chapter,
devoted to the lecture platform, comprises some delightful
memories of tours in the United States and elsewhere.
"News of a Famous Victory" has an interest and value
beyond its vivid description of the streets of London on the
night when word came that Ladysmith was relieved. It
brings into strong light the national feeling at the moment
about General BULLER, then recognised as the deliverer, stub-
bornly fighting his way to the aid of the beleaguered
garrison. Since then prejudice, the stern necessity that
compels officialdom to offer a victim, and, not least effective,
errors of judgment on the part of a soldier more at home on
the battlefield than the public platform, have obscured

A FAMINE IN DANCING MEN.

I'UTS ON NO END OF SIDE OVER IT."
General BULLER'S fame and broken his career. The latter
is irremediable; the other will come right in the end.
Meanwhile IAN MACLAREN has, incidentally, done a good thing
in reminding a fickle public how they received News of a
Famous Victory.
Although the Baron cannot conscientiously approve of
MARIE STEWART and HYDE TURNER'S book of eccentric coinic
sketches entitled A Zoological Collection (SKEFFINGTON) as a
work of art, yet the ridiculous ideas which the amateurish
designs illustrate are full of original fun and most quaint
conceits.
The new edition of Penelope's Irish Experiences, by KATE
DOUGLAS WIGGIN (GAY AND BIRD), is a capital travelling com-
panion for either a veritable voyageur or one gut fait le tour
de sa chambre, within the limits of "his mind," which " to
him a kingdom is." Pleasantly tripping goes Penelope, avoid-
ing such pitfalls as would have endangered the book's
popularity. The illustrations by Mr. C. E. BROCK are among
the best things this clever artist has done, and suggest that
if a new edition of CARLETON'S Tales of tlie Irish Peasantry.
or of LOVER'S or LEVER'S works be demanded, here is a
skilled pencil with fine point. THE BARON DE B.-W.

[DECEMBER 17, 1902.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN "EYE-OPENER" AT THE HAYMAEKET.
SELDOM has the old lesson of "Look before you leap"
been so dramatically, yet with so light and skilful a touch,
enforced as it is in this play of Captain MARSHALL'S, the
moral of which is, "do not rush into matrimony blindly."
Cupid is, proverbially, blind; but Cupid was never a marrying
youth, nor did he ever give himself away, not even to
Psyche, in marriage. It is true that there is another
modern sporting and slangy application of the word
"blind," and if the state of the hero of The Unforeseen (a
hopelessly bad title, by the way) were intended to subtly
represent the case of a dipsomaniac restored to his right
mind, seeing single objects as they are, instead of singular
things as they don't exist, even then the piece would be
welcome as evidence of how deftly a clever playwright can
treat the most unpleasant themes, and can turn unpromising
materials to the very best of purposes.
Here is a gay, young, modern, moustachio'd and bearded
anglican parson of "moderate views," that is of limited
vision, fortunate enough to be a well-paid, prosperous, gen-
tlemanly, kindly, country-gentlemanly vicar. For weak
eyes he visits Paris, not for a "weak end," but to see a
specialist. (The entire story is more or less a parable with
a moral.) And, in Paris, while gazing from the window of
an hotel, he is struck by the appearance of a remarkably
elegant lady standing on a balcony with a young man,
who, as he learns from his friend Capt. Richard Haynea, is
a bachelor and a very gay dog. "What a sight for sore
eyes!" The Rev. Walter Maxwell concludes that this is
no place for him, and withdraws to wait in the hall for his
friend. The Rev. Walter's diffidence somewhat recalls the
manner of that eccentric little cleric, Mr. Robert Spalding,
who lunched on "a ba-ath bun" in a waiting-room, and
observed, "I don't like London." How funny the Rev.
Robert would have been here, and what a pity he couldn't
have arranged with Mr. PENLEY and Mr. CYRIL MAUDE to
have been allowed to come to Paris in such excellent com-
pany as that at the Haymarket Theatre in this piece!
Act I. being over, "on we goes" to Act II. From Paris
to Parish. Venit, vidit—and then, within three years, every
one in his parish sees more and more of their vicar the
Rev. Walter, while he, seeing less and less of them, falls
blindly in love with the eldest daughter of a General
Fielding, who is, presumably, the "squarson." This
eldest daughter is the lady whom the Rev. Walter has seen
in company with the gay dog aforesaid at the Parisian
hotel, but whether as the Lothario's better half or worse
half he hasn't inquired, until, his eyes being opened to
facts in Act IV., the idea suddenly occurs to him that he
has seen his wife's face before. Where? Why, of course,
in Paris. Hotel, private apartments, loose fish! ahem!
Then he puts one and one together, and asks her the
question direct. She, foreseeing that whatever her answer
may be he won't believe her*, is silent.
Wanted, a Deua ex machind! Here he is, Captain Dick
Haynes, who, "having to the rank of Major General risen"
("keep up the Major General!") now steps out of bis
ambush in the garden and hands a letter to the Rev. Walter.
This letter, which is a kind of "last dying speech and
confession," has been written by Henry Traquair, with
whom Miss Fielding had eloped, and who, on losing his
money, refused to keep his promise to marry, preferring to
blow out liis brains after most carefulty exonerating Mies
Margaret from all blame, and explaining, in this communi-
cation to Captain Dick, that she had never for one moment
been either his better or his worse half, but was all that the
purest fancy could paint. Which letter satisfies the Reverend
Walter. He is a parson and a lover, who in dumb show
(poor man! blind until the Fourth Act, and then at last
dumb!) kneels to her as if begging pardon for having
doubted the evidence of his own senses when in Paris;
and she, evidently as astonished as delighted to find that
in the shepherd of the flock she possesses the moat docile
of sheep, hugs the once suspicious lambkin to the fold of
her pretty dress. But—but—but . . . well, 'tis natural there
should be "butts " where a sheep is concerned; and if the
life of this couple at the Haymarket is only half as happy
as it promises to be, verily they '11 have their reward, and
the author of their happiness his, take it as they will, in cash
or notes.
Mr. CYRIL MAUDE, as the cricketing parson, blind as a bat,
plays the part so skilfully as to win all sympathies. Mr.
ALLAN AYNESWOHTH is invaluable as the military gent, richly
deserving all the decorations he can get for distinguished
service.
Mr. C. M. HALLARD, as Henry Traquair, a very difficult
part, seen only in the First Act, after which "he is heard
no more," is admirable. Not a few unsophisticated persons
in the audience but will expect him to turn up again in
the course of the story, perhaps at the vicarage. To have
done this would have transformed the comedy into Adelphi
melodrama, a story of murder, blackmail, and virtue trium-
phant! Never too late to write this, eh, Captain?
Bob Fielding, the boy, is delightfully played by Mr. A. E.
MATTHEWS, who was so sprightly as the fast youth in the
revival of Betsy at the Criterion. To him, as to that most
natural actress, DOROTHEA BAIRD (once Trilby), as Beatrice
Fielding; to clever Miss MARIE LINDEN as Miss Campion Parr;
and to Mr. Euro LEWIS'S life-like study of that absurd old
piece of fatuous pomposity, General Sir A. Fielding (these
two last being peculiarly Dickensian characters), is due the
unquestionable success of the comedy scenes which intervene,
artistically, as a most welcome relief to the serious interest
of the play. For, say what we wih1, put it how we may,
Margaret Fielding is only another and latest version of " the
woman with a past." It is not much of " a past" maybe,
but a past it is; and this character Miss EVELYN MIIXARD
depicts with the very finest art. Her passion, her demure-
ness, her yielding, her awakening, then her true tenderness;
and with all this her nervous duplicity, and her intense fear
that makes her a coward—all these variations of temper are
admirably portrayed.
The name of Fielding is not ill chosen as that of a country
family into which a cricketing parson marries. Pity is it
that the little man cannot change his name from Maxwell to
Batsu-ell, but anyhow it may be taken for granted that
though they will have a good innings at the Haymarket, yet
among them all, excellent players though they be, they will
only get one run—but that ought to last till the middle of
next year.
Britons never will be Slaves P

TO BELINDA.
[A writer in the Academy suggests that, in
order to prevent the increase of the unfit,
persons about to be married should be com-
pelled to insure their lives.]
FAREWELL, BELINDA! All too soon
Our dream of bliss is over;
Tis not for us to honeymoon
To Paris vid Dover.
Then, prithee, let thy winning charms
To love no longer lure me;
I cannot clasp thee in my arms,
For no one will insure me.
Despair has seized my bosom, for
I may not call thee wife, love.
I 've begged a dozen men and more
To take my wretched life, love.
The first refused me when he found
My mother's father's uncle,
Though otherwise his health was sound,
Possessed a big carbuncle.
The next one very clearly proved
My chance of living slight is:
My second cousin once removed
Had had appendicitis.
The third one said, "I fear your life 's
The very briefest span, Sir;
Your sister's husband's uncle's wife's
Great uncle died of cancer."
In vain I begged, besought, abused,
In vain my tears did fall, dear;
They one and all of them refused
To take my life at all, dear.
And since they adamantine be
To tears and even pelf, love,
The only course that I can see
Is taking it myself, love.

IN THE STOKE-HOLE.
A jiouxiNc.; contemporary recently
recorded the temporary disappearance
of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN during his voyage
to Egypt. We are now able to supply
the following details :—•
ILM.S. Good Hope.
Great excitement was caused on board
this morning by the disappearance of
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. He was not in his
cabin, he was not on the hurricane
deck; no one had seen him go over-
board. Where could he be? Search-
parties Vere sent out, the whole ship
was examined, and at length the Colonial
Secretary was discovered in the stoke-
hole. He had disguised himself by
removing his eye-glass and orchid, and,
when found, was engaged in conversa-
tion with some of the engineers who,
on learning that their visitor was the
Colonial Secretary, were amazed at the
intelligence of the questions he put to
them.
"That hard, black substance that you
are shovelling into the fire is really coal?
How very interesting. And you bring
it in scuttles from the coalcellar?"
"We calls 'em bunkers, Sir."
"TUP.! PAP!"
"Bunkers? That's what BALFOUR
is always talking about, but I did not
know he knew anything of ships. Why
do you make such big fires?"
'To keep the water boiling."
'But don't you find it very hot?"
'Yessir."
'What would happen if you stopped
stoking?"
'The fire would go out."
'And then?"
'There 'd be no steam."
'And then?"
'The ship'd stop."
'Why?"
'Cos it wouldn't go on."
'I see. I suppose it takes a great
deal of force to drive along this ship?"
"About twenty thousand horse-
power."
"What is horse-power?"
At this point the mate in charge of
the first search-party came into the
stoke-hold and penetrated the Colonial
Secretary's disguise. Unspeakable was
the relief of everyone when Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN reappeared on deck none
the worse for his adventure. The
engineers agree that his affability and
intelligent conversation were worthy of
the highest culture.
LITERARY NOTES.
Mr. EDMUND GOSSE'S annotated edition
of Tlie Clarke's Tale may be expected
shortly.
A Strange Tory, by Lord HUGH CECIL,
is announced. The book is dedicated
without permission to Col. KENYON-
SLANEY.
A delightful Christmas gift will be
found in the Breakfast Table Series as
edited bv Sir THOMAS LIFTON.
The new volume in the First and
Fortunately Last Novel Series is Mr.
ANDREW CARNEGIE'S " Life's Little Steel
and Ironies."
SIR ALFRED JONES, K.C.M.G., is
Chairman of the new jam factory in
our great West Indian Colony. It has
accordingly been suggested that in
future it should be spelt Jam-maker.
FROM BEN TROVATO'S NOTE-BOOK.—The
poet WHITTIER was doubtful concerning
his fame in the future. "Ah!" he
observed, sadly, "even my greatest
admirers will find it difficult to prove my
existence, as when comparing me with
other celebrated wits, they will positively
affirm that there never was a wittier!''

Brewed in our study mutual tea—
In short, were boys at school together.
And sad it is that two such friends . •... ,
(I loved you, WILLIAM, as a brother)
In after life should strive for ends
Dissimilar to one another.
And sadder still, that of the pair
While one (that's you) has prospered greatly,
The other should be doomed to fare
Upon the whole but moderately.
'Tis mine to woo the fickle brief,
To turn my brain to courts and sessions.
To you the calling of a thief
Appeared the noblest of professions.
No lack of skill your efforts marred,
Your work was silent, clean, and thorough;
They dreaded you at Scotland Yard,
They idolised you in the Borough.
For years you bore away the palm;
And now, unless the tale 's unfounded,
You live a life of fatted culm,
By every luxury surrounded.
With scented soap you idly toy,
Nor e'en the dental brush eschewed is.
Your toilet over, you enjoy
The latest novel, fresh from Mudie's.
If to the trencher turns your mood,
A silver bell the meal announces.
You call for farinaceous food,
They bring you two-and-thirty ounces.
Such almost Eastern pomp recalls
That master of the lyric art, MOORE.
No wonder men within those walls
Extol thy charms so highly, Dartmoor.
On prison life, it seems to me
The sentimentalists talk twaddle.
Does it depress a man when he
Forgets to walk and learns to waddle?
No! Fortunate I count that man;
Yea, deem him happiest of mortals,
Who passes in a prison van
Triumphant through those fairy portals.
WILLIAM, I hate my daily toil,
I weary of the constant striving,
The cares that vex, the traps that foil,
The difficulty of "arriving."
For ease with dignity I sigh,
For rest and peace I long with fervour—
To-morrow I go out to buy
A jemmy and a life-preserver.

He. Y-yes. Something of that kind.
She. The beginning looks like "Summa Are"
He. Ah, I daresay. Latin, you know.
[Hopes that this answer will check all further curiosity.
She. I know tfcoi—but what does it mean?
He. Well, "Summa Are" is—er—High Art, don't you
know. [Feels that he is on safe ground, so far.
She. And what's that other word, right at the very end
—Artern?
He. Artern? Oh, artem is—(calling out the reserves of his
Latin declensions)—Artem is—Art, too.
She (surprised at the elasticity of the language). Really?
And "then there are two words in the middle I can't make out.
He (thankful to hear it). No—the—er—glare of the chan-
delier gets in the way, rather.
She (using her opera-glasses). One word seems to be
French—"est."
He (with a sudden sense of scholarship). No, it 'B the
Latin for "is."
[Hopes to goodness she can't make out any more of it.
She. The next word looks rather like—" Celery."
He. It's more likely to be "celare."
[He pronounces it in the foreign mannei—which, he
considers, ought to satisfy any reasonable person
that he knows more about it than he cores to show.
She (perseveringly). "Summa Ars est celare Artem." How
would you translate that?
He (who wouldn't translate it at all if he could avoid it).
Well—er—"celare," you know, "celare" is—urn—(tries to
remember what the deuce " celare" used to be when he was
at school)—it's rather difficult to render exactly.
She. But can't you give the sense of it?
He (deciding to rush it). Celare is—to celebrate.
She. Oh? High Art is to celebrate Art. But I don't see
much sense in it now!
He (with presence of mind). Don't you? You will, if you
think it over a bit.
[She seems still inclined to return to the charge—but, to
his infinite relief, the Act-drop rises and effectually
changes the subject.

THE War in Somaliland has now been
handed over by the Foreign Office to
the War Office. The correspondent ol

The British and German Govern-
ments have sent ultimatums to
Venezuela. If they are not complied
with it is intended to seize that
country's Customs. It is hoped they
may prove better than her manners.
As a result of Sir HORACE RDMBOLD'S
alleged indiscretions, a new Foreign

to our diplomats begging them to be
more diplomatic.
Some of our leading newspapers now
publish special cablegrams from America
every day. We are thus kept quite as au
fait as our cousins themselves with all
the most important events that happen
on the other side of the Atlantic. For
instance, last week the news was flashed
across to us that a pet pug-dog, having
a tooth filled with gold and set with a
diamond, had been lost in the Broad-
way. Formerly we might have been
kept in ignorance of this for many
weeks, if not altogether.
A Scientist named Dr. STILES has
discovered that laziness is not a vice,
but is due to a germ, aud lazy people
are delighted. They forget that the
Doctor may discover a means of exter-
minating the germ.
It is reported that the Shah of PERSIA
has reduced the number of his wives
from 1700 to 60. We believe this is
equivalent, in Persia, to becoming a
widower.
M. PELLETAN has given permission to
the sailors of the French Fleet to wear
their hair in any style they like. It is
now surmised that the famous Marine
Minister recently ordered a reduction in
the crews of all the war-vessels in order
that there might be room for longer
hair.
The French Premier has issued
notices to the police on the subject of
Church bells. They are to find out
whether they are rung in such a way as
to prevent the inhabitants sleeping.
Apparently it is the custom in some
parts of France to ring the bells during
the sermon.

The next meeting of the British

some difficulty is likely to be experienced

A wonderful instance of presence
of mind, which has caused con-
siderable annoyance to Mr. SOOSA, is
reported from Chicago. A fire broke
out at Lincoln School in that city.
Upon seeing the flames one of the

started playing a Sousa March, where-

Sir John the Contractor. " So OLAD YOU 'BE PLEASED! A v RESEH VOIR!"
HOW TO GET ON.
No. IV.—IN SOCIETY.
(Concluded.)
IT may be complained that up to this point I have not
given any substantial advice to the aspirant who wants to
get on in Society. I admit the justice of the complaint, but
I want my difficulties to be considered. Everybody seems
to have his or her own special idea of what Society is. You
may hear it said both of A. and of B. that they go out a
great deal into Society. A. frequents heavy political dinner
parties and big receptions and occasionally unbends to the
opera; B., on the other hand, dines a great deal at fashion-
able restaurants, goes on to the homes of musical comedy,
tempered by tights and imbecility, and pays visits at country
houses. They never meet by any chance, but still it appears
to be admitted that both A. and B. are in Society. Again,
the old Countess of BAGSWELL never goes anywhere except to
the annual meeting of the Missionary Association in which
she happens to be interested. The rest of her time she
spends between her bedroom and the gloomy mausoleum to
which she attaches the giddy name of drawing-room. Yet
to pretend that her ladyship, the descendant of innumerable
peers, and the widow of a former Under-Secretary of State,
is not in Society even when she is cabined in the dark
recesses of her home would be to open the flood-gates and
do all the other dangerous metaphorical things which your
base-born Radical threatens. My own bedmaker at Cam-
bridge, a lady of unimpeachable rectitude but of cinerary
aspect, had her own strict notions of what befitted rank.
She was asked by an undergraduate evangelist to attend a
prayer-meeting in the Barnwell district, and reported the
invitation to me. "Did you go, Mrs. Hiaos?" I asked her.
"Me go!" she answered with dignity, "certainly not.
Why, some o' them people that I met there might want to
come callin' on me next day!" That settled it. The
evangelist lost a possible convert, but the bedmaker
preserved her social exclusiveness.
Honestly, I hardly know what to advise. It seems a
feeble and unmeaning thing to tell a man or a woman not
to strive unduly, to be content with the friends and asso-
ciates that have been provided for him or her by circum-
stances and natural merit, not to imagine that because HOBBS
has £10,000 a year and keeps a yacht and rents a grouse
moor he is better than NOBBS, who has only £2,000, or even
than DOBBS, who keeps a cheerful face and a considerable
family on £700. If you happen to be in the DOBBS class
! Behold them
countrv house
move
or a
boundaries of which
shiver in the cold,
you '11 find him, I ^'ager, a more amusing companion than
either NOBBS or HOBBS, though his intimacy won't cost you
anything like so much in pocket or anxiety. At any rate
there 's one lot, a little but a noisy one, that you need never
worry about. These are the brainless, chattering nincompoops,
male and female, who gild themselves, so to speak, up to the
eyes, and live a life of strenuous sloth and self-indulgence,
flinging about with both hands their own money and that
which they obtain from accommodating lenders, and finishing
up a paragraphic career under the stern eye of Sir FRANCIS
JEUNE or Mr. Justice GORELL BARNES. What a life it is!
How far exalted above the petty struggles and stupid
restrictions of the ordinary ten-commandment world is the
plane of_ superiority on which these marvellous beings
turning a first-class hunting centre
into, an easy Agapemone, on the
the poor expelled domestic virtues
while the gay inhabitants gamble
through the night, bet through the day, and talk their
silly slang of nicknames and vapid catch-phrases in an
inextricable confusion of false sentiment, arrogance, spend-
thrift waste and mean intrigue and deceit. Great God!
I 'd rather be a pagan suckled in a creed outworn—than
spend an hour or a minute, or a fraction of a minute, in
this glittering atmosphere of affectation and the primitive
vices, unrelieved by a single fresh breath of manly honour
or true womanly feeling. Pah! the mere distant contem-
plation of it, as it is described in the columns of tlie dailv
Press, reporting what is called a Society case, is enough
to give one a fit of intolerable nausea. Why are such
fribbles permitted to exist, they and their money-bags, and
their dresses and jewels, and valets, and sly conspiring
maids with their keen eyes at the keyhole? What object
do they aim at, what purpose in the Providential govern-
ment of the world do they fulfil, except to warn by
disgusting? If that is the Society you are striving for,
there 's no more to be said. May Heaven send you a good
deliverance when you 're done with it!
YOUR CHRISTMAS CARD.
WHEN I was a nice little girl,
And you weren't so very much older,
Ere my locks had forgotten to curl,
Though they only came down to my shoulder,
And you were quite small, with no muscle at all,
I certainly think you were bolder.
To-night your discreetest of cards
To my heap makes the latest accession,
"Best wishes and kindest regards"
Is not an impassioned confession;
Yet your symptoms reveal what you try to conceal—
That you suffer from over repression.
The cards that you sent me of old
Were fifty times nicer than this is,
Of " Love to dear MOLLIE " they told,
And you filled up the spaces with kisses.
Of course it's correct to be more circumspect,
But somehow—there 's something one misses.
Oh! I wish we were children once more,
And candid and frank in our dealings,
We 're both of us sulky and sore
With these subtleties, tricks and concealings.
But until you speak out, there's no manner of doubt
I 'm bound to dissemble my feelings.

his bonnie briar-root pipe and thought-
fully watching a yacht race.
"Jolly place," he said, "if it weren't
for the Big Black Birds. Look at that
one ''—and he pointed out a predatory
specimen with a beak full of food ravished
from an adjacent perambulator: "Can
you conceive anything odder and stouter?
It terrifies me. Or rather," he added
in a whisper, "he terrifies me. For his
name is PETER ROBINSON. Or is it JAY?"
he asked in tremulous accents.
We murmured something about the
courage of a man who could stand up
to fast bowling.
"Ah," said Mr. BARBIE, removing his
pipe and gazing at the contents of the
bowl, " in some matters I am a Craven."
"My plans? " he added in response
to our question. "I don't know for
certain. There's a book on the Lower
End of the Serpentine that I ought to
write—where the rockery is. I find that
children go there too. And then there
is a great subject in the strip by the
Knightsbridge Barracks where the per-
ambulators go. Sooner or later these
things must be done. There's the
Dogs' Home, too; and I 've just heard
that for real inconsiderateness there's
nothing to touch the waiters in the
House—so I suppose I must stand for
Parliament."
"Have you thought of any particular
constituency?"
"Well, nothing has been decided yet,
but I have been approached by a depu-
tation from Coventry, the centre of the
perambulator industry."
"And what about your play, Mr.
BARRIE?"
"My play? Oh, I 'm no good except
as a change bowler. But I 'm filling
up next season's fixture-card like any-
thing. We 're going to have a week in
the Chilterns — wonderful place for
making hundreds—Mr. MORLEY has
joined the team, and I 've asked the
Admirable CRICHTON BROWNE, but he
insists on playing in Harris Tweeds."
We ventured to interrupt: "Not
cricket, Mr. BARRIE; we meant your
stage play."
"Oh, my stage plays; I never think
of them. They 're just odd-time work
between smoking and the Gardens and
the Club and fielding mid-off. Perhaps
I shan't write any more; perhaps I
shall write fifty."
"Don't you think H. B. IRVING very
good as Crichton?"
"He ought to be! I took enough
pains with him. Why I sent him
GLADSTONE'S Studies subsidiary to the
Art of Butler, a book weighing at least
a ton. It broke down three perambu-
lators getting it to him."
As we strolled about, Mr. BARRIE
showed us several interesting landmarks
of the Gardens.
"That," he observed as we passed
northward along the Broad Walk, "is
ROBBIE NIOOLL'S Tree, where he lost a
saxpence and found a shilling. A good
deal of excavation has been done there
ever since by MARMADUKE MORGAN and
CECOO YERKES. And that," continued
Mr. BARRIE, pointing to a small white
stone on the margin of the adjacent
mere, "is called the Meeting of the
Waters. There it waa that Major POND
fell into the Round Pond and would
have been drowned had not he been
rescued by a chimney-sweep named
WHITELEY, who dived in, extracted
him, and then stood revealed as Major
POND'S long-lost grandfather. Odd,
wasn't it?" added Mr. BARRIE. "But
now, come along home and have a
smoke. There '11 be some lunch first."

"Oh, I 'm no good except as a change bowler.
And hailing two passing perambula-
tors, dislodging their occupants, and
courteously offering me the larger, he
briskly signalled to the nurses in charge
to propel us in the direction of the

LAW AND POLICE.
(A Report of the Future.)
THE report that the FLASHAWAY divorce
suit is postponed is unfounded. It will
commence on Tuesday as advertised.
There are still a few gallery seats to be
obtained at five guineas each.
At Bow Street yesterday, JOHN JONES,
a costermonger, was summoned for
having obstructed the crowd waiting
outside the pit of the Divorce Court.
Lady HIGHTONE having given evidence
in support of the charge, the defendant
explained that he was merely trying to
get his barrow through the crowd on
his way from Covent Garden.
The magistrate said that the pleasure-
seeking public must be protected, and
fined him five pounds and costs.
At the same Court, the Earl of
BLANKLEY was charged with having
driven a motor car to the public danger,
and further with having run down a
boy with fatal result.
His Lordship explained that he was
co-respondent in a divorce suit, and
was on his way to the Law Courts
when the accident occurred. The speed
may have been a little excessive.
The magistrate said, that bearing in
mind the public character of the busi-
ness on which the defendant was en-
gaged, he would discharge him on
payment of half-a-crown and the funeral
expenses.
The fine was at once paid.

"OOKS AN' EYES!"
'ERE's THE
MUSICAL GOSSIP IN 1920.
WE understand that no fewer than
36 rehearsals have already taken place
of the new Symphonic Poem which the
eminent composer, Herr CAMII.LE HCM-
PERSCHENCK, has graciously consented to
conduct at the concert to be held on
Saturday next at the King's Hall.
The work in question, which is
entitled Tohu va Bohu, is a superbly
successful attempt to express in musical
terms the salient features of the forty
millions of years which elapsed between
the cooling of the earth's crust and the
birth of KHU-FU (alias CHEOPIS), the
great Pyramid builder. It is laid out
in 22 movements, and alike in length,
complexity of structure and sonority of
orchestration, exceeds the efforts of all
composers, ancient or modern. The full
score occupies ten large folio volumes,
each weighing close on two hundred-
weight.
To give full scenic effect to this massive
and monumental manifestation of the
Teutonic Zeitgeist, the King's Hall has
been entirely redecorated by a firm of
Berlin upholsterers, and only German
will be allowed to be spoken in the
intervals.
We have to record the death in a
London workhouse of the once well-
known English pianist, Mr. ARTHUR
WELLINGTON JONES. It will be remem-
bered that at the period of the German
invasion he refused to uncover at the
command of the conductor of a German
band, and was sentenced to death, a
penalty which was afterwards com-
muted, on the intercession of Herr
RICHARD STRAUSS, to imprisonment for
ten years.
The magnificent humorous orchestral
suite, "Graf von Biilow's Lustige
Streiche," will form the chief fixture at
the Philharmonic Concert next Tuesday.
With his usual generosity Herr GOLU-
CHOWSKY, the conductor, has invited an
English performer on the triangle to
take part in the performance.
For the first time for many years a
native singer was heard at the Popoffsky
concerts on Saturday. No satisfactory
reason has been given by the Directors
for this rash act, which met with well-
merited reprobation. We understand
that the popular member for Marylebone,
Mr. WILHELM BUNGERT, has announced
his intention of asking a question in
the House on the subject at the earliest
opportunity.
The Musical Directory for 1920 has
just been issued. It contains the names
of 14,324 persons, of whom no fewer
than 53 are English. Of these, how-
ever, 41 are upwards of eighty years of
age.
The Minister of Fine Arts, Mr. CARL
GOLDFLEISOH, has granted special per-
mission to Sir HUBERT STANBRIDGE to set
to music some lyrics by the German
poet, ScnAKsriER.
"'TIS PLEASANT IN (STEINWAY) HALL,"
Had PETER the Packer, or any mem-
ber of Packer's Band (once upon a
time well known to those who dance
in circles) had the filling of Steinway
Hall on the occasion of HAYDEN COFFIK'S
Nineteenth Concert and Recital, it could
not have been more crammed than it
was, with any regard to individual
comfort. Mr. COFFIN in excellent form
generally, though a trifle annoyed at
the late arrivals of a few unfortunate
persons who could not manage to be
in time, for his turn, and for the one
in which Miss ELDEE cleverly assisted
him. Those who have not heard M.
MAURICE FARKOA'S French version of
"Mrs. Enery Awkins" must not lose
the next opportunity of doing so. Mr.
H. B. IRVING recited W. S. GILBERT'S
immensely funny Etiquette, and com-
plied with a vociferous encore (a word
signifying "over again if you please ")
by giving a totally different recitation.
The next concert is advertised for Feb-
ruary 2. This is full notice—about two
months ahead. Certainly "Sharp's"
the word, and the name of the "Agent
in Advance."

approach of milder weather the Thames
Steamboat Company will inaugurate a

it will be called the Twopenny Tub.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE DIAKT OF TODY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Dec. 8.—
Question of who ia Leader of Opposition
popped up to-night with fresh activity.
Is it Louon? is it SYDNEY BOSTON? is it
WALTER LONG? or is it merely C.-B.?
Enquiry arises on London Water Bill
with reference to proceedings last
Friday. Arrangement then come to
between WALTER LONG in charge of Bill
and SYDNEY BUXTON, the boy standing on
the burning deck of Front Opposition
Bench, whence all but he had fled.
Settled that in consideration of certain
concessions made bv Minister Opposi-
tion will permit Bill to run through
Committee to-night. This afternoon
down comes C.-B., and amid cheers from
Mr. LOUGH throws over SYDNEY BUXTON,
demands another day for Committee.
This too much for seraphic temper of
PRINCE ARTHUR. Sixty days and nights
he spent in the wilderness of Committee
on Education Bill, never once betraying
lapse of patience or fracture of temper.
But, really, this is going a step too far.
If understandings openly come to across
floor of House between representatives
of parties are to be ignored or upset,
how is business of the country to be
carried on?
Whilst PRINCE ARTHUR put this ques-
tion murmur of conversation rose from
lower end of Treasury Bench where
Under-Secretaries flock. Turning 'in
that direction and transfixing innocent

The Chief Whip of the Tories.
(Sir Al-x-nd-r Acl-nd-H-d.)
"Please, Sir, it wasn't me!"
AcLAND-Hooo with flaming glance he
sharply said, "Don't let us all be
speaking at once." ACLAND-HOOD not
had such a shock since he was at Tel-el-
Kebir.
Standing between the Deep Sea
(represented by C.-B.) and Mr. LOUGH,
SYDNEY BUXTON tremblingly explained.
Deserted by his leader and his colleagues
on Front Bench, recognising value of
concessions made by Minister, anxious
only to improve the Bill, he had struck
a bargain approved by every Member
taking active part in discussion save
the plumbless LOUGH. At same time
he was bound to say—here he folded
round him imaginary white cloth—before
taking action he should have consulted
his leader. He apologised to his right
hon. friend, and joined in his request
for extension of the debate.
PRINCE ARTHUR looked on scornfully
at this exhibition of generalship; would
hold no further parley in the matter.
Moved to suspend Twelve o'clock Rule
so as to make sure of carrying Water
Bill before House rose. LOUGH insisted
upon taking division; of distracted
Opposition only eleven went into Lobby
against proposal, the rest fleeing till the
thing was over.
"Getting on nicely, don't you
think?" said SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S
GATE, of late so much engaged before
other tribunals as to have neglected
High Court of Parliament. '' Quite un-
necessary for fellows opposite to do or
say anything with intent to keep us out
and themselves in. They may safely
leave the whole thing in our hands."
Business done.—Water Bill through
Committee.
House of Lords, Tuesday night.—A
new word added to authorised Parlia-
mentary phraseology. Bishop of HERE-
FORD called Leader of the House a
Laocoon, and no one offered reproof.
Certainly this was not in the Commons
but in the Lords, where all sorts of
queer things are done. To-night, for
example, having formally gone into
Committee on Education Bill, TWEED-
MOUTH protested on behalf of certain
Peers who prepared speeches for Second
Reading, found no opportunity for
delivering them, and were promised to
have opening specially made on motion
to go into Committee.
Idea of grown-up men insisting on
making-believe to debate in order to
work off belated speeches seems more
like a wheeze from Wonderland than a
matter of fact from Westminster. Is
simply true. House having actually got
into Committee in preparation for real
business, positively got out again so that
two or three Peers and prelates might
deliver speeches prepared for Second
Reading!
The absurdity unexpectedly justified
by notable speech from Bishop of
HEREFORD. No small measure of courage
needed to rise from midst of the
heavenly and surpliced choir whitening
benches below Gangway, and de-
nounce a measure primarily designed
in interests of the Church. Hardy
HEREFORD performed his task with a
courage, a dignity, an occasional note
of pathos, that commanded respectful
attention. Since the wrangle began no
such weighty and powerful denunciation
of the Measure nas been spoken in
Parliament or on the platform.
It led up to the startling imagery of
COUNTY GUY as "a pathetic and noble
Laocoon." The serpents who in their
fatal embrace crushed the son of PRIAM

threw in three for the entanglement and

"The noble Duke," he said, "is
bound in the triple coil of a disastrous,
ill-starred union of the old-fashioned
Tory, the traditional Whig, and the
Birmingham Radical."
This supplementary reference to an
eminent statesman at the moment on
the seas bent on serving his country
sent a shudder through an Assembly
that had not turned a hair when it
heard its esteemed Leader called a
Laocoon.

Tuesday, December 16.—Winding up

along. Tells me Irish Nationalist
Members have resolved to invite GEORGE
WYNDHAM to dinner. Admit the idea is
not original. Rival restaurants have
seen entertainment of several leaders of
united Opposition. At beginning of

Education Bill, PRINCE ARTHUR dined
with the Welsh Members. Why should
Ireland wait?
Preliminary difficulty arisen in matter
of nominating chairman. Shall it be
WILLIAM O'BRIEN, JOHN REDMOND, TIM
HEALY, or the tumultuous TULLY? Not
yet settled, but will arrange itself.
Meanwhile the "smiling assassin"
much pleased at projected honour.
Only stipulation he makes is that in
consideration of family ties he may at
the feast be seated in convenient con-
tiguity to a door arranged on the
principle of Cousin HUGH'S ideal school-
room, leading not necessarily into
church, but into sanctuary. In the
event of a "regrettable incident" de-
veloping in the heat of dinner, the
Chief Secretary might at the critical
moment withdraw, leaving his hosts to
fight it out in fashion proverbial in
Kilkenny.

REFLECTIONS.
[" Mr. LONG has perhaps more frequent
occasion than any other speaker in Parliament
to begin his observations with a reference to
the empty condition of the benches around
him."—Manchester Guardian.]
WHEN Mr. BALFOUR speaks, or JOE,
Why are the benches crowded so
Until they almost overflow?
I wonder.
Why do the eager Members run
Forsaking tea and Sally Lunn,
Cake, cmmpet, buttered toast and bun,
I wonder.
But when I catch the Speaker's eye,
Why do no eager Members fly
To hear my oratory? Why?
I wonder.
Why do they linger where they are,
Inhaling perfumes of cigar
In smoking-rooms remote and far?
I wonder.
Nay, why do Members who are in
The House, become so few and thin
As soon as ever I begin?
I wonder.
And where but now a crowd has been
Assembled, why is nothing seen
But empty benches, bare and green?
I wonder.
Why do distinguished strangers beat,
With common herds, a swift retreat
As soon as I get on my feet?
I wonder.
Why do they flee with language strong?
Perhaps they think, this madding throng,
That life is short and I am Long?
I wonder.
PICKWICK UP TO DATE.
I.—MR. JINGLE'S ELOPEMENT.
"THEY 'RE gone, Sir—gone clean off,
Sir!" gasped the servant.
"Who's gone?" said Mr. WARDLE
fiercely.
"Mister JINGLE and Miss RACHEL—
started off in a motor hired ten minutes
since, and"
"Quick !" shouted Mr. WARDLE, "my
car, at once! JOHN, HARRY—some of
you—go and get the petrol! TOM, my
respirator and spectacles this instant!
Come along, PICKWICK, we '11 catch
'em in less than no time—out of the
way, WINKLE, out of the way! Here
we are—jump in, PICKWICK. Stand
clear there !''
And in less time than it takes to
describe the event the two intrepid old
gentlemen had started on their chase.
Away they went, down, the narrow
lanes; jolting in and out of the cart-
ruts, and bumping against the hedges
on either side.
"Is it — is it safe?" mumbled Mr.
PICKWICK behind his respirator, as he
peered anxiously through his goggles
into the surrounding darkness.
"Hope so," replied WARDLE, fumbling
with the speed-gear. "Wish I under-
stood this blessed machinery better,
though. Only had a motor a week,
A violent cannon against a signpost
cut the remark short.
For a while there was silence. Then
Mr. PICKWICK, who had been sniffing
uneasily, broke the silence once more.
"My dear good friend," he gasped,
"what is this abominable smell?"
"Acetylene," rejoined Mr. WARDLE
abruptly. "Something gone wrong with
the lamp. Look out, sharp corner here
— and now we go downhill. Sit tight!"
But to comply with this direction
was impossible. Mr. PICKWICK was
thrown up and down in his seat like a
cork. His goggles were jerked from
his nose, his cap blown like a feather
towards the sky, his whole body con-
verted into one tremendous bruise.
"Ah, we 're moving now," cried Mr.
WARDLE exultingly — and indeed they
were moving. Fields, hedges, and trees
seemed to rush from them with the
velocity of a whirlwind. Suddenly Mr.
PICKWICK exclaimed with breathless
eagerness: "Here they are!"
Yes, a few hundred yards ahead of
them was a motor, on which the well-
known form of JINGLE was plainly dis-
cernible. It was travelling quite slowly,
and Mr. WARDLE increased his speed yet
further with a shout of triumph. "We
have them, PICKWICK, we have them!"
he cried, while the car flew like a streak
of lightning. And then suddenly — a
bump — a crash — and Mr. WARDLE and
Mr. PICKWICK found themselves seated
in the middle of the road, which was
strewn with fragments of their machine.
Two members of the constabulary were
coiling up a rope which, stretched across
the highway, had procured their down-
fall. A third policeman licked his
pencil, and produced a notebook.
"Thought our rope would spoil your
little game. Thirty-seven miles an
hour, I make it. Names and addresses,
please?"
JINGLE'S car had stopped a short way
ahead. "Ta-ta, PICKWICK," he shouted,
"good-bye, WARDLE — measured mile —
scorching a mistake — police waiting —
twigged 'em directly — slowed down.
If lucky — option of fine — probably
imprisonment. Well, so long !" and re-
starting his machine, he disappeared.

A FIRST-RATE BAG-IN THE BOND STREET COVERTS.
ALL Partridges, fifty-five brace and a half of 'em, every
one of 'em in excellent condition, all the better for hanging,
ready and waiting, and a great treat for everybody. Walk
in and see the uncommonly Fine Art Show at 148, Now
Bond Street. Now then, Ladies and Gents, walk your
chalks, enter within the pastellated walls, and see what can
be done with crayon, wash, and body colours (sounds like
sending you to " Bath! ") in this most interesting show.
2. "Clementina." We do not know who CLEMENTINA is,
whether related to Argentina or Concertina, but we make
her acquaintance here and admire her immensely.
4. A Single Figure. Why single? Ought to be married.
5. Lady Teazle as she walked off in a huff after the
great scene with Sir Peter.
9. Encore " Clementina" All the better for a " wash."

Giant himself invisible in foreground, or rather in fore-water.
Further description useless. Notice shoe to your right.

side where the pain is—probably the stitch in time which

Jones (arriving in the middle of the Overture to " Tristan und Isolde "—guile audibly). "WELL, THANK GOODNESS WB 'HE IN PLENTY OF TIME!"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Three Years' War (CONSTABLE), loyally dedicated by its
author, General DE WET, "to my fellow-subjects of the
British Empire," is unquestionably the book of the year.
It pretends, says my Nautical Retainer, to no sort of literary
charm, but, what is of still greater value, it gives with
eloquent simplicity an immediate record of the most
brilliant strategist that the War produced. The actual
narrative of events in which the author played his part
with such rare intelligence and gallantry is told with an
obvious desire for honesty and the avoidance of boastf ulness.
When he passes beyond facts to the expression of opinion
he is liable to show something of the bitterness of the
partisan who can see only one side of a question. His
comments upon "War against women" take no sort of
account of the military necessity imposed upon us by the
action of the Boer women in sheltering combatants, convey-
ing information, and concealing ammunition. On certain
questions his views differ widely from those of General
BOTHA. The blockhouses are declared by DE WET to have
been practically useless; by BOTHA (Appendix A) they are
described as "likely to prove the ruin of our commandos."
Of the purpose of the Boer Delegates in Europe, DE WET
emphatically states that they never entertained the idea of
European intervention; yet at the Vereeniging meeting (of
which the minutes, here reproduced for the first time in
English, are of unique interest) BOTHA distinctly refers to
the failure of their hopes in this direction.
As a personal history of hazardous enterprise against
odds, the book remains the most remarkable of human
documents. Mr. SARGENT'S frontispiece portrait is a fine
achievement; and the volume is produced with that sound
workmanship which characterises all Messrs. CONSTABLE'S
productions.
To their Highway and Byway Series Messrs. MACMILLAN
have added Highways and Byways in London. The narra-
tive and description are from the picturesque pen of Mrs.
E. T. COOK, the abundant illustrations from the pencils of
HUGH THOMSON and F. L. GRIOOS. The book differs in plan
from the works of WALTER THORNBURY, JAMES THORNE, and
other tiDers of the fruitful field. Whilst not neglecting
ancient records and sources of information, Mrs. COOK,
having diligently trodden the highways and byways, chats
about them in personal and pleasant fashion.
Celebrities and I (HuTCHiNSON) opens with some danger-
ously puerile reminiscences and reflections. Miss HENRIETTE
CORKRAN begins her story when she is in the nursery, and
it is, naturally, concerned with tarts, jams, and comfits.
My Baronite was beginning to get tired of the book when
about a third way through he found it grow interest-
ing. Miss CORKRAN, a typical Irishwoman educated in
France, has through her life gazed on the world with sharp
eyes, on the whole not fully appreciative, or obtrusively
friendly. Whilst still in the nursery THACKERAY gave her
tarts, and five-franc pieces. So he 's all right. But she
sees spots on other suns. The habit does not make the
book less attractive for others beyond the family circles
immediately concerned. Miss CORKRAN has come into con-
tact with a remarkable succession of notable people, and,
evidently not being what you would call shy, has made the
most of her opportunities of observation. The scrappy
chapters are full of vivid pictures, crudely coloured but
effective. The description of Mrs. LYNN LINTON, who seems
to have been kind to the young girl and taken her about a
good deal, and her graphic description of a Sunday evening
at WESTLAJ.TJ MARSTON'S, are fair examples of her talent,
taste, and temper. And what do admirers of ROBERT
BROWNING think of the discovery made on looking out of the
back window at Warwick Crescent of the author of The Ring
and the Book " nursing a goose, absolutely carrying it in
his arms "?
"'Tis a gruesome title," quoth the Baron, meditatively.
"What title may that be, an'please you ?" inquired a Junior
Baronitess. Responded the Baron, frowningly, " Marry, 'tis
'The Woman who uxnt to ,' a place unmentionable to
ears polite, let us say 'to Tartarus,' eh?" "Compris,"
answered the Baronitess. "Yet 'tis a booklet of gracious
aspect." "Ay," returned the Baron, "and of excellent
quality, the quantity being limited. Its authoress is DORA
SIGERSON, and the work is published by Ttie de la More Press

of the Company can never be "de la
'More remains behind!'" Prosit!
"So as I weepe and wayle and pleade in vaine
While* she aa steele and flint doth still

Those who affect such amoretti will find
SPENSER'S best, and a portrait of the
poet to boot, in a pretty little pocket
volume of the York Library series
(BRIMLEY JOHNSON).
Christmas at the Mermaid (no sort of
relation to The Lady from the Sea), by
THEODORE WATTS-DCNTON (JOHN LANE) is
one of those fragrant "Flowers of Par-
nassus" suitable as a poetic evergreen
for the literary button-hole at Christmas.
The illustrations by HERBERT COLE make
perfect a delightful booklet.
Sir EDWARD REED—so runs the report
of the Baron's Assistant—has published
a volume of Poems (GRANT RICHARDS).
Many men less justly celebrated than
Sir EDWARD have done the same without
any such warrant as he possesses. He
has designed mighty ships of war, actual
ships with turrets and guns and all that
may belong to a ship, and now he sends
forth a varied fleet of verses to sail the
waters of approval. I drop the metaphor,
and beg to declare that there is the real
right stuff in these poems. The verse
is emphatically good in technique; not
only is the voice resonant and manly,
but it is the voice of one who has a
refined nature and a sensitive ear for
melody.
Fairy Fancies and Fun, by EDITH
KING-HALL (FOXWELL), with love "to my
nephew EDDY," is the Eddy-fying dedi-
cation of a dainty little book in a fanci-
fully-decorated cover, containing some
quaint conceits, such as might be ex-
pected from a clever student of Alice
in Wonderland. No doubt little EDDY'S
eddy-cation will be hereby considerably
assisted.
Those who may have read (in various
Magazines named in a prefatial note)
"several of the tales" which appear in
Tales by Three Brothers (ISBISTER)—the
three brothers bemgPhil,Kay,aad Percy
Robinson—will, doubtless, be delighted
to meet them again in a form which
proves that they have the "power to
add to their number." The book offers
just that sort of "appetiser" to which
we can sit down for half an hour on our
way "from labour to refreshment."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CHRISTMAS BOWL.
OH, London's streets are a dismal sight
If you wander about on a Christmas night;
The doors are tarred and the blinds made trim,
And the fronts of the houses are black and grim.
I warrant there's plenty of laughter there,
Jollity, jokes and warmth to spare,
With food in abundance and wine, no doubt,
But it's all within while you stand without,
And shiver and gaze and stamp and dream,
And watch your breath as it goes in steam,
Curling, lingering, floating, wreathing,
And you wonder idly what keeps you breathing,
And sending these ghosts of yourself to follow
The vanishing ghosts that the dim mists swallow.
So there I walked, and my thoughts were sinister
As those of a—what shall I say ?—a Minister
Who is chased by a loud-voiced Opposition
From his pride of place and his high condition,
While nobody marks him or heeds his wishes,
And his foes fall-to on the loaves and fishes;
Or a Bishop, it may be, of this place or that place—
No opulent See, and by no means a fat place—
Who, while he has trimmed and toiled and waited,
Has seen no end of the rest translated,
And himself grows lean in despair of a fatter See—
So I walked till at last I came to Battersea.
And there on the bridge I stood set high,
And the river below went sliding by:
Dark and gloomy and deep and old,
With spears of fight on its ebb a-shiver
That broke its eddies with glints of gold,
Solemnly slid the ancient river
Between dark banks where the mist clung damp
To the glittering serpent of lamp on lamp
That trailed to the east where the moon hung low—
Never was seen a larger or rougher ring—
With her face all scarred and a brick-dust glow
That served to set off her expression of suffering.
Then after a minute I turned, and back
I trudged and trudged with my thoughts still black;
And there, as I stolidly trudged, I knew
That somebody else was trudging too.
Faster 1 went, but I never outpaced him,
So I set my teeth and I turned and faced him.
I never saw a jollier sight
Than my fellow-trudger that Christmas night:
A pilot-jacket the man was wrapped in,
And his eyes were gleaming with fun, and glancing
Like a couple of fairies dancing, dancing;
And he looked like a storm-tossed old sea captain,
With a face so battered by every weather
That a man might meet from Penang to Porlock,
That it made you just pull yourself together
And hitch your trousers and touch your forelock,
As if, while still for the shore you hanker,
You had got rowed out to a ship at anchor,
You being at that time rated A.B.,
With a roll in your walk like a two-year baby,
And had climbed the ladder and stepped aboard her,
With your ear cocked sharp for the Captain's order.
Now where had I met the man? I knew
He had never commanded a ship or crew;
His face and his figure, I knew them well,
But what was his name I couldn't tell.
Stay, there was—" Tush" to myself I said,
"It can't be he, for he 's long been dead,
Dead and buried this many a year,
And Westminster Abbey had hia bier,
And Westminster Abbey's storied stones
Are the vault that covers the great man's bones.
But still there's a look in his face, a quip
Of roguish spirits that haunt his lip,
A tilt of his nead with its bold, strong high brow,
And a quick sharp trick of his lifted eye-brow—
If it's not—but I know it's not, because
CHARLES DICKENS is dead "—but, by Zeus, it teas/
And, oh, what a joy to take his hand
There in the street where he came and found me,
Back, straight back from the shadow-land,
And his glorious capturing smile thrown round me.
DICKENS, hurrah! he was back again—
Back with his store of jovial laughter!
Off went he; in his rushing train,
I, all wonder, went rushing after.
He stopped at a house, made up his mind,
Passed right into it, I behind;
I don't know whose and I can't say where,
But well I know that a house stood there.
And then like a flash we seemed to enter
A great room fixed in the house's centre,
Where, to judge by the table spread and lighted,
An army of guests had been invited.
But, when we were in and the big door thrust-to,
I couldn't see anyone else save us two.
At the end of the table stood a bowl,
A bowl built in like a landlord's fixture,
And into it swift he poured his soul,
And he filled it full, and he stirred the mixture
With a business air till there came an aroma
Better than rum, lemon, water and cinnamon,
That had roused old RIP from his state of coma
With a leap like an eel's from the board that you skin
him on.
And oh, but the magical air was humming
With the cheeriest songs I used to know;
And in through the door old friends kept coming,
Dear companions of long ago.
Dear old gardens I used to roam in,
Dear old voices I thought were lost,
Dear old scenes that I had my home in,
Jolly old days of sun or frost,
Where every day had a bright to-morrow,
And nobody dreamt of pain or sorrow;
Childhood's merriment, childhood's noise,
Boyhood's frolic and jokes and joys;
And full in the midst a Christmas tree,
Loaded and lit as they used to be—
These sights I saw and these sounds I heard
While the bubbling mixture was stirred and stirred.
Till—lo, with a flash that leaves you darkling,
Out went the vision gay and sparkling,
And the bright hall turned to a gloomy, dead room—
And I was alone in my own dull bedroom. R. C. L;

NEW BOOK IN PREPARATION FOR CHRISTMAS DAY.—Underlying
Raisins, by the author of Upper Currents. Appropriate.
Next volume, in the cold weather, Slap, by the author of
Pat.
A DISTINGUISHED FOREIGNER IN PANTON STREET.
IN Monsieur Beaucaire at the Comedy Theatre Messrs.
TARKINGTON and SDTHERLAND have presented the public
with a pretty play. The story here dramatised has, I
believe, already achieved some success as a novel; and
indeed it will have occurred to many who have applauded
the acting at the Comedy, that the novel, as a work of
descriptive art, must have enjoyed no small advantage over
the play. The dialogue that would "read" well in the
study is apt to become prolix on the stage ; while characters
that are "people of some importance'1 in the pages of
romance, when concreted as dramatis personal, appear aa,
more or less, merely decorative accessories of the scene.
Thus it comes about that on the broad back of Mr. LEWIS
WALLER as Beaucaire, and on the comely shoulders of
Miss GRACE LANE as Lady Mary, is laid the burden of the
comedy, and admirably they carry it off; Mr. WALLER, as in
chivalrous duty bound, imposing on himself two-thirds of
the task, and acquitting himself thereof to perfection, or aa
near it as possible.
Miss CONSTANCE WALTON is a piquante. Lady Rollerton, and
Mr. EDWARR FERRIS gives a clever rendering of the wicked
Duke of Wintersiit, whose title, judging from his own con-
duct and that of his boon companions, would have been
more to the purpose had it been Duke of Whataset! Com-
paratively uneventful as is the progress of the first two
Acts, the curtain is raised again and again after the final
tableau of the Second Act to enthusiastic applause aroused
by the contents, as it were, of a "surprise packet" being sud-
denly disclosed to the audience in the person of an old lady
of fashion, got up to the very life of the period, and leaning

on the arm of her chivalrous cavalier,
Monsieur Beaucaire. This lady, Miss
MINNIE GRIFFEN, impersonating The
Countess of Oreenbury (" by the kind
permission of Mr. FORBES ROBERTSON,"
who is not at present requiring the
services of this actress as Desdemona to
his Othello) has merely to appear, has not
a word to say, and, lo and behold, the
house rises at her, cheering her to the
echo! The climax of this Second Act
is a great coup de theatre.
After this there are ambushes, and
skirmishes, and clashing of swords, and
smashing of sticks, and cracking of
whips, and some impressive acting by
Mr. H. SAVILE as Francois the faithfu'l
valet of Monsieur Beaucaire, who is
always on the point of letting his
master's title out of the bag.
As in Tlie Admirable Crichton, so
here, an entirely new character is sprung
upon the audience in the last Act; and
at the supreme moment it is Mr. ARraoR
LEWIS, representing the Marquis de Mire-
poix, French Ambassador, who enters as
the deus ex machind, and on his word,we,
and everybody present, accept Monsieur
Beaucaire as the most noble prince
Monseigneur le Due d'OrUana. Strong
indeed, and a firm favourite with the
audience, must be the actor whose popu-
larity can sustain two such shocks as
these startlingly effective introductions
of new personages, one at the end of the
Second Act, and the other at the close
of the play. Yet this does Mr. WALLER,
and his Monsieur Beaucaire may be
regarded as a triumph over dramatic
conventionality, and a real success in
spite of the dramatists.
GAML& NORGE VERSUS CHICAGO.—The
Yankee boasts that he can make use of
the whole hog, "bar the squeak." The
hardy Norseman says that he can

DIARY OF THE M.F.H.
Friday.—Eheu! fugaces. Another
Christmas and another so-called "Box-
ing" Day. Why, oh why was Boxing
Day ever invented to plague and harass
the wretched M.F.H.? It releases
hordes of "operatives" from the neigh-
bouring town of Grimyville, others—
too numerous to mention—from work-
shop, desk, and counter, to crowd round
coverts, shout, rush about, and head
foxes. And, crowning nuisance of all,
"TOMMY" and his young friends are
home from school. We all know what
that means in the hunting field! Whoa
—I mean woe—is me!
Arrived at the meet, Sir PORQSON
POSHBORO, our Member, seized me and
introduced his two sons.
"They 're home from Cambridge, and
want to see whether your pack can get
along as fast as their own Draghounds
there!"
I "squirmed," and humbly begged
these hopeful youths to remember that
fox catchers are not supposed to race
like a Drag; adding that I would feel
obliged by their not riding on top of
hounds. Par parenthese, I may observe
that these giddy undergrads subse-
quently left open a gate, thus releasing
fifty head of horned cattle to rove over the
county—smashed a flight of new rails,
and then galloped, "Hades for leather,"
across big field of strawberry plants,
doing absolutely inestimable damage.
Scene at meet beggared description.
Shoals of pedestrians, motorists, costers'
barrows, bicyclists, mill-hands, opera-
tives, and five brake-loads of the genus
'Arry, with paper ornaments in their
hats, playing mouth organs, most of
them half drunk. Hurried hounds into
opportune paddock, but not before two
had been badly kicked. Noise deafen-
ing. Think Spion Kop must have been
comparatively peaceful.
Enormous "field." Every human
being within a ten-mile radius who
could raise anything with four legs, a
head and a tail, present.
Got hounds through crowd at last,
and off to first covert, which was im-
mediately surrounded by people on
foot, people on bicycles, people in
motor-cars, people of all descriptions,
and all making as much noise as they
conveniently could. At least a dozen
boys on ponies, exchanging school
reminiscences at top of their voices.
Just as a much mystified fox endeavoured
to break at down-wind side, BROWN
minor shouted to SMITH major, "Blow
the hounds! can't we have a go at
these fences, without all this beastly
waiting?"
Fox promptly turned back and was
chopped in covert. D ear little boys!
D elightful Boxing Day!
Abandoned attempt in despair, and
gave orders for Hangers' \\ood, two
miles off. Nondescript crowd followed,
but we managed to pick up outlying
fox before they could catch us. Little
WILLIE rushed his pony to only jump-
able place in first fence. Pony refused,
and little TOMMY promptly fell over him.
Unable to stop my horse, pulled off to
unjumpable part. Result, bad fall.
Scrambled up, and had to ride my
horse's tail off to catch up hounds.
Just as I got on terms with them again,
they checked—most unaccountably—at
a road. Fearsome - looking object—
which I found to be a live man—sitting
in motor-car, clad in wild-beast skins
and goggles, yelled, "Hi, Mister, I 've
seen the fox! Directly he caught sight
of me, he turned short back!"
I thought of the trials and tribula-
tions of the day, and of our lost run.
Then I said, freezingly, looking at the
Ancient-Briton-like, skin-clad man before
me,
"I think, Sir, our fox showed most
excellent taste!"
Then I gave the word for " Home."

LETTERS FROM JOE.
HM.S. Good Hope.
MY DEAR ARTHUR,—Here we are in
mid-ocean. You have been at sea too

"The perfect rest I am enjoying."
often yourself to need any description
of what it is like; but a short account
of the perfect rest cure I am enjoying, far
from Lobbies and Deputations, LLOYD
GEORGE and Dr. CLIFFORD, will, I know,
give you pleasure to peruse and, perhaps,
serve to recreate your mind amid the
stress of the Third Reading.
My dear fellow, there "s nothing like
the sea—even on a man-of-war. I don't
say that a liner would not have suited
me better—there 's such a confounded
flavour of ARNOLD-FORSTER about all these
guns and blue-jackets—but the sea's
the same; and whenever I feel home-
sick I have but to listen to the screw,
and there I am at dear old Birmingham
once more!
Have you ever seen blue-jackets drill-
ing? That's my idea of how one's
Party should behave. One movement
animating several hundred men, taking
their orders from the officer in command
—yourself, of course !—who else could it
be? Any individual conscience dictat-
ing independent lines of action, and
the man 's in irons. That's discipline.
I wish we could get some of it into the
House. We must see; I have great
plans in my head. Wait till I come
back.
But the sea, ARTHDE; the sea! We
had a gale in the Bay—a regular
Opposition night—but I never turned
a hair. When I get tired of politics, I
must take up the Navy as a hobby.
CHARLEY BERESFORD will require looking
after one of these days. Besides, there
is always room for a good Admiral;
and I believe one could grow orchids
near the engine-room, where there 's a
steady heat.
Off Gibraltar I made a rather neat
joke. We had exchanged fatuities by
wireless telegraphy, and the Captain
was telling me of the monkeys that are
sometimes seen through a glass. I
looked, but could distinguish nothing.
"No," I said, "I see no monkeys; only
one Mar-coni of the Rock." You might
try that on DEVONSHIRE, and let me
know his comment.
Yesterday, wandering about the hind-
quarters of the -vessel, which -they call,
I believe, the stern, I came upon a
petty officer who knows Birmingham.
I foresee that I shall be much less
bored than I was beginning to fear I
should be. He explained to me the
difference between :a Scotch and a
Belleville boiler. By the way, how is
WALTER LONG getting on with Ms Water
Bill? I am rather afraid that, in spite
of his efforts in stamping out rabies, he
is likely to infect the Radicals with
hydrophobia. You might tell that to
HAROODRT with my love.

"We had a gale in the Bay—a regular
Opposition night—but I never turned a hair."

I have refreshed my memories of Egypt.
With Port Said I
was not favourably
impressed. As a
coaling station it
may be excellent,
but it does not

Can you, for example, connect me

look up at me. The dam pleases me,
however, though I did not visit it—a
most effective form of closure. Couldn't

I should say, in spite of -what we read
in the French papers, that Egypt is
happy, although it is true that the camels

out here, there should be no difficulty
in getting him three acres and a camel.
The Arabs are affable, but I prefer the

wrong with Egypt, between you and
me, is that it is not a British Colony.

P.S.—I have just heard, by Marconi-

letter of mine fetched only five shillings,

of this news, which has doubtless
already reached Mombasa and Durban,
is distinctly prejudicial to the cause of

Love only occupies the brain
That once could think of dinner.
Around me myriad waiters flit,
With meat and drink to ply men;
Alone, disconsolate, I sit,
And feed on thoughts of Hymen. ,
The kindly waiters hear my groan,
They strive to charm with curry;
They tempt me with a devilled bone—
I beg them not to worry.
Soup, whitebait, entrees, fricassees,
They bring me uninvited.
I heed them not, for what are these
To one whose life is blighted?
They show me dishes rich and rare,
But ah! my pulse no joy stirs.
For savouries I 've ceased to care,
I hate the thought of oysters.
They bring me roast, they bring me
boiled,
But all in vain they woo me;
The waiters softly mutter, "Foiled!"
The chef, poor man, looks gloomy.
So, EFFIE, turn that shell-like ear,
Nor to my sighing close it, ••
You cannot doubt that I 'm sincere—
This ballad surely shows it.

CHARIVARIA.
ACCORDING to the United States census
returns, the oldest white American is
120 years of age, while there is a negro
145, and an Indian 150. It was only the
influence of GEORGE WASHINGTON that
prevented the white American being
150.
It is stated that Mr. MARCONI will
shortly surprise the world with another
invention. His opponents are wonder-
ing whether it will be that he has sur-
mounted all the difficulties of Trans-
atlantic wireless telegraphy.
Lord CHARLES BERESFORD says he is
regarded as a mustard-plaster on the
back of Authority in the House of
Commons. We should have thought
there was more of the Salt than the
mustard about Lord CHARLES.
The practice of Crown Princes making
love to American actresses has received
a blow from which it may take some
years to recover. Miss MAYBELLE
OILMAN, who was courted by the Crown
Prince of SIAM, has given some of the
Prince's love-letters to the New York
papers for publication.
The trouble with the Volunteers con-
tinues,. Those of the officers who are
not resigned to the new Regulations
are resigning.
The Public are cautioned against a
man who is going about soliciting alms,
and, among other statements, declares
he had a horse shot under him at
Trafalgar. The Police believe he is an
impostor.
During the past week, large cargoes
of geese and turkeys have been arriving
daily from the Continent, and there is
little doubt that Christmas will be held
on the 25th December this year as usual.
It has been prophesied that, on the
evening of that day, many little boys
will complain that their tailors have
made their waistcoats too tight, while
others will quietly prepare for death.
A curious epidemic has made its
appearance with the beginning of the
dark mornings. A number of persons,
on being awakened, find themselves
overcome by an irresistible feeling of
drowsiness, and drop off into a sleep
again, from which comatose condition
they are only aroused with the greatest
difficulty.
The whole matter is wrapped in a ,
certain amount of mysterv, but there
is, it seems, some danger that the duel
which was arranged a considerable time
ago between French expert swordsmen
and Italian expert swordsmen, may take
place.
The Mad Mullah has written a letter
in which, as the price of peace, he
demands the concession of a port, the
recognition of his sphere of influence,
and the removal of the restrictions on
the importation of rifles. The Jingo
press is urging the British Government
not to submit to these terms.
The Prince of MONACO, who has an
army of some thirty-two men, holds
that all international disputes should
in future be settled by arbitration,
instead of by an appeal to force, and
is about to disband his armv.

PICKWICK UP TO DATE.
II.—CHRISTMAS AT DIXGLEY DELL.
THE best sitting-room at Manor Farm
was a good, long, sanitaiy apartment,
fitted with patent ventilators in abund-
mce, and on Christmas Eve it looked
its very best. Bowls of primro-.es and
cowslips decked the tables, flowers culled
aarlicr in the day by the fair hands of
ARABELLA ALLEN. Mr. PJCKWICK, who was
seen to bebusilyengaged with his tablets,
\vas believed to be meditating a letter to
the Times on the phenomenal abundance
of these flowers in mid-December.
"Come,"cried old WARDLE, boister-
ously, "come, bring up your chairs to
the Lot-water-pipes! Fill your glasses!
The jug of barley-water isn't nearly
empty yet! It's Christmas Eve—and
the clock shall strike ten to-night before
one of us shall even think of going to

"Here I be, Sir," replied the Fat Boy,
starting from a remote corner, where
lie hnd been taking his temperature on
the sly.
"Have you weighed yourself to-day?"
"Yes, Sir," said the" Fat Boy.
"And taken your baths and your
medicine? Well, then, it's Christmas
time, and you shall have one extra
charcoal biscuit in honour of it! Here
—and now he off and run half-a-mile!
"\Verry generous, too," said Mr.

young adiposity! You 're a disgrace
to hygienic science, as the sawbones
said to his wife veil she died o' blood-

"Health before all things," said
WARDLE. "Still, at Christmas — yes,
EMMA, I will have a drop of that
lemonade—and a piece of dry toast.
WINKLE, you 're looking feverish. 1 've
a brand of quinine in my cellar that '11
make you as right as a trivet!"
"This," observed Air. PICKWICK,
edging still nearer to the hotrwater-
pipes, " this is, indeed, comfort."
"Our invariable custom," replied
Mr. WARDLE. "Everybody sits down
with us on Christmas Eve, as you see
them now—servants and all. (Of course
we quarantine 'em first, and then spray
them with iodoform.) And here we sit,
and tell stories."
"Ghost stories ?" asked Mr. PICKWICK.
"No, no; uncommon bad for the
nervous system, ghost stories — we
talk about microbes and influenza,
and someone reads aloud from the
medical papers. TRUNDLE, my boy,
where are those purple pills? Come,
PICKWICK, give us'a talc!"
"But I don't know any," protested
that gentleman, taking off his spectacles
and looking rather confused. There
was a general murmur of protest.
"Dear Mr. PICKWICK," giggled one of
the poor relations on the outside of the
circle, "perhaps can tel] us—something
—about—his liver!"

The widow, and to wipe the orphan's
tear,
And ease the aching misery of War.

And lay his sceptre down;
He won the Victor's bloodstained

She earned the Healer's crown.
NURSERY NOTES AND QUEER
QUERIES.
LEARNED Philologists, Rhymenologists,
and Christmas Holiday-ologists will be
interested in the following excursus Ik
Nursere Rimd:—
For ages the origin of the first couplet
of the well-known verse
"Hi Diddle Diddle,
The cat and the fiddle,"
has presented difficulties almost insuper-
able to students of all ages. It is now
almost certain that the author of this
piece of early poetry was a distinguished
maker of musical instruments, who was
protesting against the passing off of
inferior violins as genuine Cremonas.
"Hi" is an allusion to the price;
"Diddle Diddle" to the cheating, and
if for "the cat" is read (which is far
more probable) "the kit," it will then
be found that the line is meant to warn
unwary amateurs against being taken
in, i.e., diddled when paying an
exorbitant ("Hi") price both for the
small violin (i.e., "kit") or for the
full-sized "fiddle." The remaining
lines the Professor will examine and
report upon later, before publishing
his most interesting work, entitled De
Dryasdustibus non Disputandum.

PILGRIMS TO THE EAST.
Marseilles, Dec. 12.
DEAR Mr. Punch, you are, we know,
Regarded as the guide of youth,
And would not willingly forego
Your love of undiluted truth;
And yet the rare inventive art
That shines in your immortal pages
Locates you on a peak apart
From other merely truthful sages.
"While they, along the lower slopes,
Confine themselves to stolid fact,
Coloured by literary tropes,
Tempered with journalistic tact,
You take a broader point of view,
Embracing realms of myth and
mystery;
They chronicle events, while you
Out of your head are making history.
The aims that lurk in Liberal Leagues
(Escaping popular remark)—
How JASPER TULLY'S strange intrigues
Came to the cognisance of " SARK "—
The thoughts of JOSEPH on the blue
(Rightly reserved against detection)—
No secret but you find its clue
Simply by force of introspection.
This being thus, I ask my soul
What am I doing here to-day?
Why should I j ace Massilia's mole
And peer across her prancing bay?
If you, m London, stage by stage,
Could touch, it off from inspiration,
Is not this Eastern pilgrimage
A work of supererogation?
All! what a tale for you to write,
Setting your winged fancy free,
Unhampered by the actual sight
Of what we others need to see!
Still, just to spare those busy wings,

The elephants and other things
Performing at the Delhi Durbar.
Meantime I hope you understand
It is across the waves we fare
With opportunities to land
Provided only here and there;
So please to wait a little while
(One has to ask these small concessions)
Till, somewhere near the mouth of Nile,
Wesend you home our sea-impressions.

HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS.
XIH.—HONEST TOIL,
I AM beginning to wish that I had
accepted my host's invitation to stay
the night. I had no idea that it was so
far from Wimbledon to Putney. The
road is distinctly too lonely to suit my
taste, for I have no stick. I am glad,
anyhow, that there is a moon. I quicken
mvpace.
That is a most peculiar figure on the
road ahead of me. It looks like a man
fSif. "How's TUB MOTOR-CAR OETTISO ox, SIR CHARLES?"
He. "Wtm, FACT is, I'\E SEEN VERY LITTLE OF IT. Yon SEE _I'vE ONLY HAD IT THREE
MONTHS, AXD WHES IT ISS'T IX HOSPITAL, I AM!"
with two gigantic horns. No, one of
them is his hat. He has it in his left
hand. What on earth is that in his
right? It looks unpleasantly like a
bludgeon. Shall I turn back?
It is all right, he is singing. I hear
allusions to an angel mother. On re-
flection I do not know whether I have
yet cause to be reassured.
I draw nearer. He seems to be
waiting for me. I see now what he
has in hia right hand. It is a huge pair
of shears. He is still singing as I
reach him:
"Ho no, my che-ild,
H-you '11 be a nangel"
Suddenly he breaks off, and shifting
the shears to join the hat in his left
band, extends liis right to me.
It is without exception the dirtiest
band I have ever seen. Moreover it is
wet. I hesitate.
"It 'a a bit—er—wet, isn't it?" I
venture to remark.
He surveys me for some time with a
bleary eye. I am ready to put up my
guard. Eventually he speaks.
"I have got," he says slowly, "a
bloomin' good 'eart."
"I am delighted," I reply, "to hear
it."
Of a sudden he flings down his hat
and the shears in the road, and extri-
cates himself with difficulty from his
coat. I again get ready. He picks up
the shears. I prepare for flight. Much
to my relief he directs his attack at the
trim hedge bounding a front garden at
the side of us, and proceeds to chop at
it wildly. After a moment he desists
and turns to me.
"Yer can't 'elp it, now, can yer?—I
ask yer, can you 'elp 'avin' a good
'eart?"
"There have been instances," I

remark, "of people who have success-
fully resisted it."
He looks at me intently.
"D' you know," he observes, "I'm
a edgercated man like yerself."
"You surprise me," I answer.
"I 've 'ad," he continues, "a college
edgercation. Yer need it, yer know,
fer my work."
He takes another clip at the hedge.
"Botany," he murmurs vaguely.
He turns to me again.
"I needn't work, yer know," he
informs me. "My fam'ly 've got money.
Any day that I was ter go down ter
the Commercial Road I could get it.
But I won't. I '11 tell yer wot it is.
I 'm proud. An' I 've got a bloomin'
good eart. All bloomin' right my 'eart
is."
I congratulate him.
"Yes," he repeats, "I 'm too proud,
that's wot's wrong with me. Sooner
than be subservient on them—I '11—
I '11 ask any stranger. Now you ain't
got sich a thing as an ole pair o'
trousers?"
"Not here," I reply; "at least that
I can spare at present."
He sets to work on the hedge again,
chopping it recklessly into the fanciest
of shapes.
"Dyou know," he observes between
the snips, "I 've took a fancy ter you.
I sor at once that you was a gentleman
—like myself. Edgercated man."
He desists again, and throws down
the shears.
"Evenin' dress," he observes, "tall
'at — excuse my pointin'—why, I've
orfen wore 'em. Oh, I've seen days."
I am sympathetically silent.
"My mother," he resumes, "was a
lady—a real lady. Curls over the ears
just there, an' a tortoiseshell comb.
Excuse me pointin'."
He picks up the shears and takes a
jagged piece out of the middle of the
hedge, then throws them down again.
"But I've got a bloomin' good
'eart," he observes. "I'll tell yer
wot's brought me ter this. 1 got boozed
one night. That's the truth. I tell
yer straight."
"I believe you," I assure him.
He seems gratified.
"Yes," he repeats, "one night I got
boozed, an' my pore ole father"
Without the slightest warning he
puts one arm round my neck and bursts
into tears.
"My pore ole father," he sobs, " 'e sez
ter me, 'Never darken my doors again.'"
I glance at the hand which he has
just removed from my neck. He
stretches it out to me.
"Yer see that "and," he says, smiling
through his tears, "there 's somethin'
there that won't rub off."
"That," I observe, "is reassuring."
"Somethin'," he continues, " that yer
cant rub off—yer may try ever so."
(1 make no such attempt.) "Shall I tell
er wot it is ?—H-onesty. I 'm h-onest,
am. 1 can't 'elp it."
Again he attacks the hedge, by this
time assuming the shape of a battered
cogwheel.
"You ain't got sich a thing," he
inquires, again turning to rne, "as an
ole pair o' trousers?"
I produce sixpence, which he pockets
absently.
"Look 'ere," he begins, "will you do
me a favour if I ask yer?"
"What is it?" I inquire.
He lowers the shears and looks at me
fixedly.
"Do you believe," he demands, "in
my h-onesty?"
"I am certain," I reply, "that it is
quite as true as your other accounts of
yourself."
"You 're right," he observes. "Can
yer lend me a shillin' until termorrer?"
I give it to him,
"Look "ere," he suggests promptly,
"can yer make it 'arf-a-crown?"
Here I stand firm. He abandons the
request with nonchalance.
"Yes," he observes, "I 'm h-onest, I
am. Sixpence you 've given me an' a
shillin' you 've lent me. I 'm treatin'
yer straight. I 've taken a fancy ter
you, an' when I take a fancy to a man
I stick to 'im."
I examine my neck.
"I 'm h-onest, I am," he repeats.
"Now the lady of the 'ouse 'ere 'oose
'edge I'm a-clippin'—excuse me pointin'
—she sez ter me, 'Air BONES, 'ere's the
money in advance; I trust yer because
I know you 're h-onest.' An' she was
right. I 've 'ad the money, an' 'ere I
am a-doin' the work."
It does not appear to me that he is
doing anything of the kind. Perhaps
this strikes him also, for he again
attacks the hedge.
I prepare to resume my way. He
desists promptly, and addresses me
again.
"There's nothin'," he declares, "I
enjoy so much as a chat like this with
a pleasant feller. I 'm a pleasant feller
myself."
Suddenly a flood of light pours out
upon the front garden. I look up and
see a red-faced gentleman with a white
moustache standing in the open door-
way.
"What are you doing heah?" he
demands, loudly.
My companion looks up from his
work.
"I 'm clippin' the 'edge," he answers
cheerily.
The old gentleman advances down
the path.
"What the devil d'you mean by
touching the hedge?" he demands,
angrily. "Clear out of this."
There follows a brief but lively dia-
logue, to which I. listen from a distance.
"Orl right, sir," concludes my com-
panion, in an injured tone, as he puts
on his coat, " it's only a mistake. Same

a glass. You ain't got such a thing as

The old gentleman has just observed
the state of liis hedge. He explodes.
"Orl right," responds the other,
"it's only a mistake. Me an' my mate
was a chattin'. I 'm not askin' yer ter
pay for it, am I?"
I begin to retire at this.
"You d d scoundrels !" gasps the
old gentleman. "I'll set the dog on

I am increasing the distance rapidly.
"I ain't afraid o' no dogs," I hear
my friend answer. '' I 've got a bloomin'

I press on. The lively dialogue still
continues. After a time I hear no more.
I look back. The square of light has
disappeared from the front garden. My
late companion is making a tortuous
way towards Wimbledon. A distant
clock strikes midnight.
VAUXHALL BRIDGE.
IN the year 1895 an intelligent
young foreigner climbed into a hansom.
"I go," said he, "to see your great
Gallery of British Art. It ia on
the quay of your great river." But
the cabman had never heard of it,
and spent nearly an hour in slums
before he got there. The intelligent
young foreigner paid the fare, which
was only five shillings, and, before
entering the Gallery, gazed around him.
"Your municipality," said he to a
jjoliceman, "is improving this quarter
of the city. It might well be better.
I see that they begin the construction
of a new bridge, since there is a teni-
I>orary one in wood."
"I dunno, Sir," said the policeman;
"the County Council's going to do
something." Then the young foreigner
thanked him politely, inspected the
pictures, and went away.
In 1905 the intelligent foreigner
visited London again. In the interval
he had married. "Let us go," said he
to his wife, " to the Gallery of English
Pictures, and then we shall see the
magnificent new bridge constructed by
the municipality." So they drove in a
cab, and again he paid five shillings,
and then he looked around.
"Heaven," cried he, "they have not
vet finished! They have not yet begun!
There is the same bridge in wood which
I have already seen." Then addressing
a policeman—it was not the same one—
he asked, "When will your magnificent
new bridge be finished?"
"Can't say, Sir," said the policeman;
"the County Council's got the job in
hand.'
In 1915 the intelligent foreigner paid
a third visit to London. This time he
brought his eldest boy. "Ah," said he,
"I will show the little man the English
pictures. At the same time we shall see
the superb new bridge opposite. It must
have been finished long ago." So they
went in an electric cab, and he paid five
shillings—he began to know the fare
by this time—but when he got out he
could hardly speak for amazement.
"What!" he cried at last. "I come
here for the third time to see the im-
provements effected by the municipality,
and there is nothing but that miserable,
dirty, hideous temporary wooden bridge!
Temporary? It is eternal!" Then he
perceived a young policeman—again a
different one—and he asked, "Will this
wooden bridge always be here?"
"Most likely, Sir," answered the
policeman. "It's been here ever since
I can remember."
"But your municipality," persisted
the foreigner, '"have they no intention
of beginning the new bridge?
"Well, Sir," said the policeman,
"you see there's a sort of a hitch.
I 've heard say the County Council
started some foundations twenty years
ago, and then found out they weren't
strong enough, or didn't do somehow.
So ever since they 've been trying to
make up their minds what to do."
Then the other thanked him, and
went away.
In 1930 the intelligent foreigner
visited London for the fourth tirao.
His eldest son, a rising young painter,
accompanied him.
"Let us go," said the father, laugh-
ing, " to the Gallery of English Pictures,
and I will show you the sort of bridge
which the citizens of London use
patiently for thirty or forty years, or
perhaps for ever."
So they went in a compressed-air
cab, and as he was going to pay the fare,
he perceived an extraordinary change.
The wooden bridge had vanished.
"Where is the old bridge ?" cried he
to the cabman, "has it fallen down?"
"No, Sir," said the man. "the new
one was finished last year. There it is."
So the intelligent elderly foreigner
jumped from the cab, and gazed at the
new structure.
"Heaven forbid," cried he to his
son, "that you should see this! You
are an artist. The temporary bridge
was mean, but it was not so hideous
as this. Let us go away as fast as we
can, and never come near the Gallery
of British Art again." So he got back
into the cab, and went away for ever.

GHOSTLY GRUMBLERS.
(See Dec, 25, 1901.)
The ex-Ghost of Rotliam Grange. "You
remember last Christmas they turned my
Grange into an Asylum for Idiots. Well, last
night, hoping to frighten just one more person
to death before leaving the place for ever, I
suddenly appeared with my most blood-curdliiig
shriek to an attendant in the darkest corridor.
What do you think she did?"
T'other Ghost. "Expired, or went mad at
least?"
The ex-Ghost. "No, she only said, 'Half a
mo'. I '11 get my camera and take your photo!'"

WAR NEWS.
(Someiehat delayed in transmission. From our
South African Correspondent.)
FLEET STREET, Dec. 5.
THE war has now entered upon a
most dangerous and desperate phase.
It is no longer a guerra al euchillo, but
what is ten thousand times more deadly
—a war to the paper-knife. Three
years have now passed since the black
December of 1899, and the enemy are
now stronger than ever. They have
lately been reinforced by a large num-
ber of English and Continental pub-
lishers, determined men who will stick
at nothing. To these are being daily
added a motley collection of translators,
lecturers, canvassers, advertisers, and
other cut-throat desperadoes of all
kinds. "Free-lances " of every nation-

"Yes, let me like a soldier fall!"
ality under the sun have given their
adhesion, and the result is a most
complete system of communication, dis-
tribution and organisation of forces.
To give precise particulars of the
strength and whereabouts of the foe is
at present forbidden by the Censor, but
I may darkly hint that Ex-President
KR-G-R has taken the field with a circu-
lation of many thousand Memoirs in the
neighbourhood of Paternoster Spruit,
the redoubtable CHRISTIAN DE W-T has
manned a vast number of Kopjes with
his new "Constables " in the Withall-
plaats district, and General BEN V-LJ-N
is ranging the country with a body of
picked Reminiscences, while a commando
of 700 Boer authors shows signs of
aggressive activity at Ahmadnagar.
K-ST-LL'S levies must not be neglected,
and last, but by no means least, D-L-R-Y
and B-THA may be expected to threaten us
shortly at some fonteinor other of print.

Meanwhile, what are the War Office
people about? Is position after posi-
tion to be surrendered ere the official
counterstroke is prepared? Are rivers
of British ink to be shed, as usual, too
late? The nation pauses, and the
British Lion paws the air for a reply.

BOUVERIF. STREET, Dec. 12.
Great Britain, indifferent to the severe
thrashing she has received in South
Africa, is again essaying the role of
international bully. She has had the
effrontery to land thirty blue-jackets at
La Guayra to rescue the English direc-
tors of the Harbour Company, who were
being justly detained as hostages by an
indignant populace. Into what further
complications the hot-headed reckless-
ness of the British commander will lead
us, I positively shudder to think. We
shall hear of further high-handed re-
leases and piratical abductions of the

"Oh! Woodman, spare that tree!"
wives and families of English " helots"
by their compatriots from the sacred
Venezuelan soil. No philo-Caribbean,
however, could read unmoved the soul-
stirring manifesto of the heroic CASTRO,
in which the peace-loving defender of
his country pleads the inalienable right
of a South American Republic to re-
pudiate all its petty financial obligations
and ignore the sordid claims of a foreign
and mercenary race. In order that so
touching an appeal may not lack re-
sponse among the anti-freebooters of the
metropolis, it is arranged that a mass
meeting of sympathisers shall be held
next Sunday on the upper plinth of the
monument in Trafalgar Square, out of
reach of the fountains and the hustling
of the usual unthinking mob.
Refuges and ambulances for pro-
Venezuelans will be provided within
the temporary wooden covers for Land-
seer's lions.

Driver of Submarine Hansom. "BLEST IF I 'D 'AVE DRIVKK YER DOWN 'ERE FOR EIOZTTEENPEXOF., IF I 'D 'AVE KNOWN THE STATE OF TIIE ROADS!"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IT is a difficult task to write the biography of a sovereign
who died but yesterday. Mr. SIDNEY LEE accomplished the
almost-impossible in a masterly monograph, one of the
features of the last volume of the Dictionary of National
Biography of which he was editor. SMITH, ELDER now issue
in a volume of six hundred pages the article partly re-written,
considerably extended. Unlike the majority of analogous
endeavours, the work is improved rather than weakened by
extension. Instead of being watered down it is braced up.
The volume is enriched by two portraits of the QUEEN, one
from the original sketch by Sir EDWIN LANDSEER, done at
Windsor Castle when the QCEEN was in her twentieth year,
the other when her MAJESTY had reached the age of seventy-
eight. Even more interesting is a draft in the QUEEN'S
handwriting of a historical document dated February 17,
1874. It is addressed to Mr. DISRAELI, informing him that
Mr. GLADSTONE has tendered his resignation. "She therefore
writes Mr. DISRAELI to ask him to undertake to form a
Government." The main difficulty in accomplishing the
task Mr. LEE set himself was the vastness of time and the
range of incident he had to bring -within the limits of a
reasonable canvas. Aided by a nice sense of proportion,
a capacity for condensation, and a rare gift of lucidity, he
has fully succeeded. He has, in brief, written a compendious
history of England during the past seventy years, adding to
it the personal interest of a long busy life passed in the very
centre of affairs.
To the Christmas parent, blessed in the possession of a
boy who likes his reading to be of an adventurous kind, I
can recommend Stan Lynn, by GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.
Stan, who displays the most remarkable courage through a
series of blood-curdling risks in China, is evidently the boy
to deal with the Dowager-Empress of the pig-tailed ones.
Equally adventurous and exciting is Jack and Black, by
ANDREW HOME. The undaunted daring and marvellous
resource of the British schoolboy were never better de-
picted. Finally, there is Grit and Go, short stories by a
variety of authors, including the late G. A. HENTY, GUT
BOOTHBY, D. CHRISTIE MURRAY, and others. It is a capital
and a dashing collection. This "leash" of books comes
from Messrs. \\T. & R. CHAMBERS.
Uncles, aunts, and other amiable people on the outlook
for pretty things for good little folk at Christmas, should
glance through Mr. GRANT RICHARDS' Dumpy Books for
Children. They run to nineteen volumes, are rich in variety
of subject, most of them are illustrated in colours, and
all are daintily bound, whilst the price is within the limits
of the most avaricious aunt or the least unctuous uncle.
Several charming booklets have reached me from the De
la More and mare Press (298, Regent Street), including
Adonaia, the Eve of Saint Agnes, and Tlie Philoliblion of
Richard de Bury, all under the able editorship of Mr.
GOLLANCZ, who has, however, omitted to inform those of the
higher culture who have neglected their Greek that Phil
O'Biblion was not an Irishman, with further explanation
which it is useless to set out here at length.
If you want some capital stories, as original in idea as
they are thoroughly amusing in the telling, take the Baron's
advice, and for your Christmas holiday and after get hold of
The Dieentanglers, bv ANDREW LANG (LONGMANS & Co.). The
illustrations, by H. J. FORD, are good.

CHARIVARIA.
MESSRS. CASSELL & Co. have published
a book entitled Britain at Work. This
is not, as its name might lead one to
believe, a treatise on Sport.
The publisher of The Unspeakable
Scot announces that The Egregious
English is now nearly ready. Other
volumes in the series are, we hear, to
be The Indolent Irish, The Wobblesome
Welsh, The Frivolous French, TJie
Gregarious German, The Unreliable
Russ, and The Double Dutch.
People are asking what an article on
"London Cemeteries" is doing in
"Living" London.
The Academy recently tried to- dis-
cover which was the best read book of
the season. A work modestly entitled
The Little Red Book has now appeared.
A Misogynist writes to draw our
attention to the publication of what he
imagines to be a new Lady's paper,
entitled The. Cat World.
Books on Gardens and Gardening
seem to be quite the rage just now.
In order to be in the swim the Board
of Agriculture has just issued a little
brochure on "Onions." It is something
of a novelty for a Government Depart-
ment to be up-to-date.
Coincidences are always. interesting.
In a recent list of Messrs. THACKER'S the
following items appear next to one

another: "The Management of Children
in India" and "The Rod in India."
And it sounds like exaggeration, but
the latter book is by Dr. BIBCH. Which
makes us wonder whether "THACKER"
is a misprint for "THWACKER."
We are not surprised to hear that
Messrs. W. H. SMITH & Co. are at last
considering what steps can be taken to
prevent their bookstalls being used bv
mean persons as public libraries, ft
seems that a most flagrant instance has
recently been brought under their notice.
At a station near London a gentleman
was not only in the habit of taking up
book from the stall to read while he
was waiting for his train, but he would
actually insert a bookmarker in the
place where he left off, so that he could
resume his reading the next day.
We have often heard that those en-
gaged in commerce will always throw
in their weight to prevent a War. In
future the huge reading public will do
likewise. Over 150 books have been
written on the Boer War.

THE old year's passing-bell once more
On midnight's solemn hush is break-

Now " right guid willie-waughts " galore
Unnumbered Scots are freely taking.
Now o'er the twelvemonth that is past
I let my recollections wander,
And while its sands are running fast,
Over its chequered haps I ponder.
I reckon up its many scars—
The traces of the wounds it gave me;
I rue the bruises and the jars
From which my caution could nol
save me,
Then, when the balance has been struck,
To ease my debt of melancholy
I claim full credit for my luck,
And curse the old year for my folly.

JANUARY 1, 1903.
OUT of the East, with lifted heart,
England, Empress, isled in the West!
Far from our face, imseen of our eyes,
But ever in dreams made near and dear,
But ours, by knowledge of faith, confessed ;— •
Out of the East, with lifted heart,
From under the glare of brazen skies,
From trackless jungle and steaming mart,
From the palms that fringe our Southward seaa,
From upland valleys of green Kashmir,
Cool with the kiss of the mountain breeze,
Where the snows lie white on our Northern wall—
Out of the East we call, we call!
We bow to gods not thine;
Time-old our temples stand for sign
Of creeds we fostered ere thy Christ was born,
And yet, because thou gavest life
Loosed from the strain of. inward strife,
Larger, more whole, more free;
Because thy lips were not forsworn,
But righteousness, with fearless face,
Spoke gently from thy judgment-place;
Therefore to thee—
Yielding the rest for this one pride alone,
Just for the right to have our part
In that high splendour reared about thy throne—-
Out of the East we call with lifted heart!

anticipate the special attention which Mr. Punch proposes to devote to

Since thine in all that our hearts may spend,
Strength or beauty, thine we are to the end:

For war, the leopard to guard thy landward gate;

To stand with thee, with thee to fall—
Out of the East, thy East, we call, we call. 0. S.

OF CRITICS.
[" The persons who sneer at a public success are wallowing in the
backwater of their own incompetence."—Ur. Hall Calne.]
WHEN carping critics preach and prate,
And when they try to tell us
That greatness is not really great.
We know what's wrong: they 're jealous.
Their sight is crossed; to men of sense
It must quite clearly follow
That in their own incompetence
They wallow.
And when I see such fellows write
Their vitriolic pages
All filled with jealousy and^ spite,
The wrath witliin me rages.
Their criticism is absurd,
And their pretensions hollow;
They cannot judge us—in a word
They wallow.
What right have they to think they know
Real drama? Could they ever
Compose Eternal Cities? No!
Or even Hamlets? Never!
The sickly offspring of their brains
The public would not swallow,
And since they cannot be all CAINES,
They wallow.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Who 'a Who (A. AND C. BLACK) makes its appearance in
anticipation of the New Year. It is fifty-five years old, and
shows in its figure something of that embonpoint which
gentlemen (even ladies) occasionally acquire at a similar age.
The circumstance is pleasing and encouraging as indicating
that the list of persons qualified to find a place in its pages
is increasing. In other words Great Britain is, among
civilised nations, growing Who's Whoer than ever. In order
to prevent the volume becoming unwieldy, various tables
appearing in earlier editions have been eliminated to make
room for the newcomers to the circle of the elect. This,
though inevitable, is regrettable, regret not being soothed
by promise of the Publishers to re-issue the tables in a
handy form. How would it be as an alternative to cut down
the autobiographies somewhat? In the va'st majority of cases
the materials supplied by the pleased subjects are master-
fully condensed. By odd accident the longest, most minute
in detail, and most laudatory in tone is that under the name
of MARIE CORELLJ, whose aversion to self-advertisement is
well known. Next in length is that of Mr. BCRDETT-COUTTS,
M.P. My Baronite will undertake to say that nothing would
please this modest couple more than to find in the next
edition of this indispensable work that the editor's blue
pencil has been vigorously at play on pages 190 and 294.
My Hibernian retainer writes of the new volume by
MABTIN Ross and E. CE. SOMERVILLE :—
"All ye who found joy in the Irish R. M.,
Of rollicking humour that emerald gem,
Your grave obligations immediately shunt,
And revel forthwith in the Patrick's Day Hunt—
A galloping medley of picture and brogue,
Describing the chase of the little red rogue.
The publisher's CONSTABIE, shortly to be
Enrolled in the ranks of the famed R. I. C."
The Prig in Prison would be, thinks the Baron, a more
suitable title for a work, which he has just perused, called
Twenty-five Years in Prisons, by No. 7 (F. E. ROBINSON).
The "illustrations by FRANK WRIGHT" are—well—wright
enough, but the matter is onlv occasionally interesting.
With so much literary talent as has sufficed for this book,
surely the writer need not have been necessarily acquainted
with more than one prison, if any.
"Better late than never," quoth the Baron as, while
casually looking over some odd volumes, he found that he
had overlooked one among them, published about a year
ago, entitled Fables de Le Puits (De Sagesse), Arriere-petit-
fils de La Fontaine, d'apres un Manuscrit non encore retrouve,
par Max Hecht (FIELD PEARSON & Co.). In this little volume
of eccentric verse the go-as-you-please French, in which
Kiki Du MAURIER would have delighted, is very amusing,
the author apologising for it prefatially, thus'
Iiecteurs, si ce volume
Qui sort de mon enclume
Choque votre prnmmaire,
Tira-lon-laire.
Et votre diction,
Tire-lon-lon,
Faitea-eu votre deuil:
Car moi, je m'en bate 1'oeil.
Among the many good things in this work, which by this
time must be nigh upon two years of age, the Baron
signalises one, "Le Diplomate et La Tortue," for the special
attention of those to whom the collection is a stranger.
Among Christmassy and Newyearsy Books Phil Robinson's
Bubble and Squeak (IsBiSTER & Co.) will be found not only
amusing, but also, as, for example, in the visits to the Zoo,
far more interesting than the nonsensical tit;e would have
led anyone to expect. The absurd sketches by J: A. SHEPHERD
are excellent specimens of his eccentric humour, and the
life-like animal portraits by CECIL ALDIN are admirable.
And so to writers, printers, publishers, and readers,
A Very Prosperous and Happy New Year is, on this New
Year's Eve, the salutation of yours, all of you, sincerely and
heartily, THE BARON DE B.-w.
HAPPY CHANCE.
On happy and delightful Chance!
By all men ardently pursued,
Swift through a tangled maze you dance;
Your trailing skirts their grasp elude;
And none your airy flight may stem,
Or catch your gauzy garment's hem.
Now from a mine the maiden smiles,
And now the mart her quips control.
Her lures outmatch the merchant's wiles;
Her glamour cheats the poet's soul;
And kings and outcasts, at her glance,
Meet in the race for Happy Chance.
Myself have followed, followed far,
O'er barren wastes and blustering seas;
Have swum the flood and leaped the bar,
Nor sought nor gained a moment's ease.
No toil, no daring could advance
My vain pursuit of Happy Chance.
And still throughout this waning year
I thought to seize her at the last,
For, lo, sometimes she drew me near—
Then with a laugh the vision passed;
And I, whom she could so entrance,
Still failed to clutch my Happy Chance.
New Year! attend, and hear me swear
I would not hold her if I might!
So let her still be far and fair,
And unpossessed, and still a sprite.
Pursuit and failure but enhance
The high delights of Happy Chance. R. C. L.

AMANDA'S CAKE.
"CAKE, dear?" said AMANDA, with a
veiled eagerness which aroused my
suspicions; and her hand shook as she
laboriously hacked out for me a
generous slice. Also the cake had, to
my mind, an unusual appearance. It
was flatter than most cakes, with a
curious depression in the middle; its
complexion was hrunette—almost negro
—though it did its best to hide the fact
under a heavy powdering of sugar.
Even my masculine mind realised that
this cake was not as other cakes.
"I—I hope it is nice?" said AMANDA.
"I haven't tasted it yet," I answered
cautiously; and I bit a piece out of my
slice, and laid the rest of it hastily
down. My suspicions took a definite
and terrible form. I had no ground at
all for supposing that my wife wished
to poison me, but—"AMANDA," said I
sternly, "what is this? '*
"It is a cake that I have made
myself!" said AMANDA, flushed and
beaming.
1 gasped, and was silent.
"I saw in Home Chirps," AMANDA
continued blithely, "that home-made
cakes are much better and much cheaper
than bought cakes, so I thought I
would try. It is quite easy. I shall
always make them at home now! Of
course this one may not be quite
right"
She was waiting to be contradicted.
I answered guardedly that it was not
absolutely like a shop cake.
"Oh, well, it is the first I ever
made, you see!" said AMANDA. "And
Home Chirps says that a little practice
is the only thing necessary."
"It is a little—gritty," said I, hunt-
inp for the least offensive word.
"Oh, that is entirely my fault, then!"
AMANDA assured me cheerfully. "Home
Chirps did say that the currants should
be washed, but it hardly seemed worth
while. I can do it another time,
though."
"It seems rather hard on the outside,
too," I remarked, trying vainly to make
an impression on the adamantine crust.
"Yes, I did burn it a little," AMANDA
admitted. "But I hoped that you
would not notice. I burnt mv hand
too—look!"
"AMANDA," I cried hastily, "that
settles the question. 1 cannot have
your pretty hands spoilt."
"I don't mind a bit—for you, dear,"
said AMANDA. "It is quite reward
enough for me to see you enjoying
something I have made. Won't you
have some more? Why, you haven't
finished your first piece! Oh, LAWRENCE,
don't you like my cake?"
"I appreciate your kind thought
immensely, darling," said I. "But

YEAR, BEAUTIFUL LADY."
Lady. "D' YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAYS TO ME? THE WRETCH MUST BE ABLE TO SEE!"
"But not mvcake?" cried AMANDA,
on the brink of tears.
"I suppose the fact is, that I have
got used to shop cakes," I said
desperately.
"But I shall be able to make them
better than any shop—with a little
practice," AMANDA persisted. "Why
shouldn't I? It's only just eggs and
sugar and butter—why shouldn't I be
able to mix them just as well as a cook
in a shop ?''
I held my tongue, and stared at the
depression in the middle of the cake.
"The fact is, you don't think I am
clever enough to make a cake!" cried
AMANDA tempestuously; and she helped
herself to a large slice with ostentation.
Shortly afterwards I felt bound to
remark that we had made it a rule not
to feed Carlo at meal-times.
'' I shall not stay here to be insulted
by my own husband!" said AMANDA,
rising in her wrath. "But I don't care
in the least. I shall just go on practis-
ing, till even you own that I can make
a cake as good as any shop!" And
so swept out of the room, and left me
forlorn and hopeless.
There was no knowing how this new
development might end. Visions of
underdone mutton and leaden pastry
rose before my mind's eye, and filled
me with exceeding horror. Something
must be done to avert the impending
tragedy. Seized with a sudden inspira-
tion I glanced hurriedly at the clock,
and snatched up my hat. It was still
early; I had a clear two hours before
dinner.
I went to Madame FLEURETTE'S estab-
lishment for the first and, I fervently
hope, the last time. To a mere man,
not conspicuously brave, it is a place of
terror: my dreams will be haunted to
my dying day by the air and demeanour

of the imposing personage who de-
manded my pleasure at the door, and.
the icy manners and French accent of
the young damsel to whose tender
mercies I was finally handed over.
She seemed to have a difficulty in
understanding what I wanted, or in
believing in my sanity when . she did
understand. She persisted -in trying
to convince me that I wanted the finished
production, and not the raw material;
she seemed hurt, and even offended, to
find that I knew my own mind, and
meant to have what I asked for. Finally
she gave in, and supplied me..with my
demands in a huge pasteboard box, at
an ^appalling price. Worn out, but
triumphant, I drove home in a hansom,
stole into the house unseen of AMAND.A,
and locked myself into my den.
It was a Herculean task. Never
in my life have I done a harder day's
work: never again shall I be able
to complain of the cost of Madame
FLEORETTE'S confections, knowing, as 1
do by personal experience, the vast
amount of labour they entail. I will
confess frankly that, even in the end,
it was not an unqualified success; but
it was certainly quaint and unique, and
AMANDA is never likely to have anything
in the least like it again. I tied it up
securely in its box, and marched boldly
into the drawing-room.
She had not forgiven me. It was
hardly to have been expected. She sat
stiff and upright by the window, with
her eyes glued "to her book, and would
neither look nor speak.
"I have brought you something," I
said tentatively.
"Oh.!" said AMANDA, without looking
up.
I put the box before her. "You said
the other day something about wanting
a new hat," I remarked meekly.
AMANDA struggled vainly with her
pride. Then she observed in an off-
hand way that it was really very sweet
of me, and cut the string. There was a
moment's awful pause.
"What — is — this?" said AMANDA
faintly, holding it out at arm's length.
I replied boldly: "It is a hat. I
have trimmed it myself."
"A hat—that you have trimmed!"
AMANDA turned it over and burst into
hysterical laughter.
"I don't know what you are laughing
at," I remarked stiffly.
"Oh, LAWRENCE, it's too funny for
words!" gasped AMANDA. "Look at
the feather! Look at the seven little
roses all in a row! And don't you see
that you 've made the bent part the
back, when it ought to be the front?"
"Do you mean to imply that I can't
trim a hat?" I inquired, in a tone of
deep offence. "Why shouldn't I be
able to do it just as well as Madame
FLEDRETTE? It's only straw and flowers
and ribbon."
There was a dead silence. AMANDA
had stopped laughing.
'' The fact is, ' I continued bitterly,
"I suppose you think I 'm not clever
enough to trim a hat! I intend to trim
all your hats in future. Home-trimmed
hats are both cheaper and better than
the bought kind. With a little practice
My remarks became incoherent, and
then ceased abruptly, for the* excellent
reason, that both AMANDA'S • hands were
over,.my mouth. "LAWRENCE," she ob-
served? very softly in my ear, "shall we
go out now and buy a real good cake at
the best confectioner's? We have just
time before dinner."
"All right," I responded amiably;'
"and then you might as well go on to
FLEDRETTE'S and see about a nat. I
won't go in with you, but I '11 wait any
reasonable length of time outside."
THE CHANGES OF THE SEASONS.
WHEN DORA dons her Spring attire,
And trips abroad to take the air,
Expectant neighbours all admire
Her virgin grace and beauty rare;
And as through primrose paths alone
We wander, while the woodlands ring,
I vow my heart has never known
So passionate a love (in Spring).
When April joys have passed away,
And gorgeous Summer rules supreme,
Among the girls who coastward stray
My DAPHNE is a perfect dream;
And when beside the sea we stand,
And. watch its wayward twists and
twirls,
I clasp my darling DAPHNE'S hand,
And own her Queen of (Summer) girls.
When Autumn cools Apollo's fire,
And Nature wears a russet hue,
What sweeter sport could heart desire
Than nutting in the lanes with PRUE?
That Quaker bonnet softly shades
A dimpled cheek I 've oft caressed —
Ah, yes, of all delicious maids
My PRUE is much the (Autumn) best.
But oh, as Winter's choler stirs,
And frost is rife, and tempests beat,
Fair IVY, warm in gloves and furs,
With grateful glance I turn to greet.
Her sunny smile and voice of gold
Amid the gloom such bliss recall
That, come what will, I proudly hold
My (Winter) love surpasses all.

Against being summoned to serve on
a jury or inquest, or to undergo similar
interesting penalties of citizenship.
Against the invidiousness of the hedge-
row constable, when motoring through
darkest Surrey or sleepiest Sussex.
Against all business losses and wear
of temper caused by delays on certain
railway lines and streets under repair.
Against invitations to country houses,
and the exorbitant tips required by
their gamekeepers and domestics.
Against unforeseen Christmas boxes
and unsuspected claims in general on

Against bad luck at Bridge and

Against too rapid changes of fashion,
necessitating unusually frequent inter-

and milliner.
Against your own tailor's bills.
Against overdrafts in one's banking

Against the rejection of MSS. by

Against losing the next Derby sweep-

Against failing to purchase Mr.

it from cover to cover.
We leave to more practised accoun-
tants the task of calculating the respec-
tive premiums, but trust that these
lucrative risks will be taken up at once
by the various Insurance Companies.

MY DEAR ARTHUR,—Although passen-
gers are forbidden to cross the line, we
have done it. Great fun! Not even
the House on an Irish night equals the
heat of the Equator. Neptune came
aboard early — rather like WILLIAM
ALLAN—and I was carefully shaved, but
not, I regret to say, by a Birmingham
razor. Subsequently he conferred upon
me the freedom of the sea, which may

be useful on Naval nights when ARNOI.D-
FORSTER is in difficulties. He also con-
ferred on me the Most Noble. Order of
the Sardine, a Mediterranean decoration,
which will turn PELLETAN green with
jealousy. One has to go to sea to get
advantages like these.
We knded soon after at Mombasa,
and I hurried through the recent cables.
Very useful having a thoughtful fellow
like AUSTEN as P.M.G. I was amused
by the Venezuelan difficulty. What a
time you are having, my dear ARTHUR!
But you have no notion how remote,
how unreal all this trouble with CASTRO
seems to me out here under this tropical
sky. And yet the name CASTRO has a
strangely familiar sound. Why, of
course, the Claimant called himself
CASTRO when he lived at Wagga-Wagga.
That, of course, accounts for the Presi-
dent's hoisting the "Jolly Roger!"
Your Education agony seems to be
nearing an end. That titled relative of
yours is peculiarly difficile now and then.
Dr. CLIFFORD will be sure to label you The
Two Cozens. By the way, AUSTEN posted
me your pamphlet, too. A fine piece
of work, ARTHUR, but not so strong in
invective as others might have made it
—one other at any rate. Why mince
matters so? Whenever you see a head,
hit it, is the true principle in political
controversy—or, as they would say here,
whenever you see an enemy, eat him.
At Mombasa we had a curious instance
of the glower of a Colonial Secretary.
Orchids have never grown here before.
But just before we arrived a charming
assortment sprang up in the night, like
mushrooms, and were presented to us
by a nice little English girl of four, who
seems to have settled here for the
purpose.
The English are truly a wonderful
people! I expected to lunch off tough
elephant steak and fricasseed okapi;
and really they couldn't have done us
better at the Athenaeum. By the way,
FAWKES, who has a rough maritime
humour, made a rather good joke at
lunch. He said, "The elephants must
make you feel at home, Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN, because, as of course you know,
they're preserved on account of their
'Ighbury tusks.'*
From Mombasa we went by train to
Nairobi (which sounds like the name of
your uncle's black man). Part of the
time we rode on the cow-catcher, but
caught, I regret to say, no cows—so I
have nothing to send to JESSE but my
unalterable love. We slept on the
Miau summit, where FAWKES (owing to
his fine appetite we call him " Knives
and Forks ") invited us to have " summit
to eat," but we were not, as you may
conjecture, kept awake by cats.
Nairobi is an enterprising little town,
quite a young Birmingham—" well laid
out" was the epithet I applied to it in
the infectious warmth of the banquet—
but more interesting than Birmingham
in its natives, the Masai, who went
through the convolutions of a war
dance for me, with the coffee and
liqueurs. FAWKES said that the band

The Masai Waltz.
was playing the overture to Masainello,
but you know I 'm not musical. To me it
sounded much more like " Tom-tom, the
Piper's son." I took some snapshots
of the scene for BRODRICK. perhaps the
weakness of our Army is .due to the
absence of war-dances.' I must go into
the question when I get back. Some of
the Masai are curiously like the old
folks at home. I kodaked three for
their ingratiating resemblance to C.-B.,
HARCOURT, and FOWLER.
Yours loyally as ever, JOE.
P.S.—We have seen some natives
suffering from that terrible scourge, the
sleeping sickness. Judging from the
symptoms I feel sure that this is the
cause of D-V-NSH-RE'S disconcerting fits
of coma.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS.
XIV.—Io SATURNALIA!
AFTER as careful consideration as my
frozen brain is at present capable oi
giving to any subject, I have come to
the conclusion that there can be no
nearer imitation of the North Pole than
the platform of this local London station
at a quarter of an hour before midnighl
this New Year's Eve. A few pinched
passengers besides myself, having been
informed that the Rishall train is the
next, tramp noisily up and down
the wintry waste, breathing visible
blasts upon their blue fingers, envying
even the pale young lady encased in
the glass Temperance Bar; even she
has wrapped a shawl round her
shoulders, and is warming her hands
against the coffee tank. For nearly ten
minutes the train indicator has mocked
us with a blank glassy stare; now at
last a faint rumble is heard from the
tunnel, and we stride expectantly to the
edge of the platform. A youthful
official approaches the indicator, and at
last with a rattle it throws some mean-
ing into its empty countenance.
"Hash Hanniganan' He Haw Hain—
her har horward," observes the official
cheerfullv.
We all brighten considerably except
a man with side-whiskers, who for some
time has been holding the official per-
sonally responsible for the Company's
refusal to provide trains every five
minutes to Dumbleham.
The rumble grows louder and louder,
and we make our way forward to be
ready to enter. At last the engine light
appears at the further end, and then,
with a vast deal of rumbling and clank-
ing, an asthmatic goods-train lumbers
slowly along the platform and past us
out of the station.
There is a general thirst for the blood
of the youthful official. For my own
part I turn on my heel and pass from
the icy gales of the platform into a
barren little refrigerator of a waiting-
room adjoining the Refreshment Bar,
and separated from it by a ground-
rs partition, through which I see
uded in mist the ghostly outlines
of Bovril jars and coffee cups. Three
minutes of this is enough for me, find-
ing as I do the sole difference to consist
in the fact that the cold is concentrated
here instead of movable.
I am further attracted by peculiar
scuffling and whooping noises from the
platform, and passing out again find
there has been a new arrival in the
person of a happy gentleman in lavender
trousers, accompanied by a shiny lady
in red velveteen. The pair are engaged
in a species of Anglo-Highland fling, to
rhich the gentleman, perspiring freely,
chants a kind of hymn to the effect that,
"Whatever may come
(Chi idleum dum)
We '11 merrily sing
God save the KINO :—
Chi idloum dike chi idleum dike chi idleum
dike chi ay." •
The lady contents herself with joining
in the lust line, which is obviously
regarded by both as the most important
part of the declaration. It is at this
stage that they link arms, duck their
heads madly, and stamp round in a
circle. In the course of this ktter part
of the figure the gentleman cannons
violently into the disagreeable man with
side-whiskers, nearly throwing him on
to the line. Side-Whiskers grabs his
hat and recovers his balance.
"Steady, ole man," remarks the other
cheerfully, "y' nearly "ad me over.
Come on, TnxY. Chi idleum dike chi
idleum dike."
Side-Whiskers splutters wildly.
"What the —conf —d !" he
observes eventually, but the pair have
resumed their dance with no abatement
of spirit. Side-Whiskers diverts his
wrath on to the youthful official.
"When's this train coming?" he
demands savagely. "Of all the
scandalous mismanagement I ever—I—
I shall go by cab next time. I—I don't
care if it costs me half-a-sovereign!"
The youthful official is on the whole,
I should think, glad to hear it. Mean-
while the jovial pair have abandoned
Terpsichore for the superior diversion
of playing hide-and-seek round the out-
side of the waiting-room. In course of
tune the shiny lady appears among us,
bubbling insanely, and noticing Side-
Whiskers, who is truculently scanning
a time-table board, conceals herself
behind his back. Soon her swain
appears, espies his quarry, and makes
for her with roars of delight. The lady
dodges between Side-Whiskers and the
time-table, and the swain following her,
a chase ensues round and round that
spluttering citizen, who has been sud-
denly aroused to an understanding of
his own function in the game.
'' Confound you — what the — get
away!" he gasps irately, spinning
round on his axis, "hi you! woman!"
Her swain suddenly pauses.
"Orl right ole man, no 'arm done,"
he'observes easily. "'Ave a glass o'
somethink?"
"No," returns Side-Whiskers shortly.
"Oh—beg yer pawdon," says the
swain. "Teetoraller? Then 'ave a
borrelergingerbeer?"
Side-Whiskers makes no answer.
"Go on yer dirty-tempered brute,"
observes the lady shrilly; "no one ain't
done you no 'arm, 'ave they?"
"You leave 'im alone, 'TILLY," says
ier swain cheerily. "'E 's orl right 'e
is. We 're seein' it in, mister, that's
orl. Noo Year's time. 'Ave a borreler-
gingerbeer?"
Side-Whiskers, very red in the face,
turns on his heel.
"Worro mister," urges the swain,
following him round, "don't go gettin
the pahder alight abaht it. We ain't
no 'arm. We 're enjoyin' of ourselves."
"Don't yer want no one else t' enjoy
themselves?" demands the lady with
hostility.—" Ole Krooj er-Whiskers?"
"'E 's orl right, TILLY," resumes the
swain, "I'm explainin' of it to 'im.
Tell ver wot it is. I 'm an Englishman.
Noo Year's time I enjoy myself—like a
man."
"Disagreeable tyke," puts in the
lady. "You ough't t' 'ave whiskers
you did."
"Like a man," repeats her swain;
"that's wot I do."
He pauses, meditating darkly.
"I ain't no bloomin' Anarchist," he
adds with feeling.
"Whiskers," continues the lady,
"like a—like a great
The lady is obviously in difficulties
for a simile, but eventually concludes
triumphantly with "drummerderry."
"I ain't no bloomin' Anarchist,"
repeats the swain with pride. "I see
it in—like a man. 'Ave a borreler
gingerbeer?"
"I wouldn't 'ave whiskers like a
drummerderry," declares the lady with
conviction.
"You leave 'is whiskers alone, TILLY,"
says her swain, "they ain't doin' you
no 'arm. 'E 's orl right 'e is. 'E 's
enjoyin' of 'imself. Like a man. No
Anarchists 'ere. 'Ave a borrelerginger-
beer?"
At this stage of the dialogue the
youthful official approaching the indi-
cator confidently forecasts the Rishall
train, adds the same loose oral interpre-
tation as before, and is forthwith put
to confusion by the arrival of a train
indisputably marked Dumbleham. Side-
Whiskers, still bristling with indigna-
tion, enters a firstKilass carriage. The
convivial pair frolic down to the third-
class end, where they suddenly link
hands and begin to sing, and are
eventually hustled into the train at the
last moment by the guard, loudly
asserting their intention of taking a
right gude willie-waught for auld lang
syne.
The train streams out and we are left
shivering on the platform, which seems
suddenly colder and bleaker than
before. Even the Temperance Bar Las
been closed for the night by the pale
young lady, who has put on her hat and
lacket and is departing briskly up the
steps. At the top I hear her exchange
remark with the ticket-collector. I
.ook at the clock and find that the Xew
Year has begun.

TOMMY'S CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS.-No.
Tommy (popping in and out of formidable-looking brook, which has stopped a number of the field).
DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY A FOOT DEEP!"
1 FoRRARD ON! FoRRARD ON!
TO WILLIAM (WHOM WE HAVE MISSED).
BRIGHT are the clays which the Fates hold in store for us,
BUFFALO BILL, you are with us at last.
Magical name! What a joy it once bore for us!
How it recalls all the tales of the past,
Some that we read of in prose or in verse,
Others, perhaps, which we heard from our nurse.
Tales of the days when to roh and assassinate
Filled the poor Indian with exquisite glee,
Formed an amusement which ne'er ceased to fascinate,
Set up his health like a week by the sea.
Nothing could hinder his playful proclivities,
Tillyou, looked in on the genial festivities.
Then, as a pigeon attempts to fly from a hawk,
Hastily winging its way through the blue,
So did the reveller, dropping his tomahawk,
Flee at the sight, Colonel CODY, of you.
Glancing behind with uneasiness palpable,
Feeling nis, too, was a head that was scalpable.
And, at the speed at which lovers, who pant, elope,
You, with a look both determined and grim,
Covered the ground like an ostrich or antelope,
Thoroughly bent upon collaring him.
That was the duty you owed the community,
Not to allow him to raid with impunity.
Once I considered these tales of your quality
Nought but a beautiful, wonderful myth,
Scorned to believe that you were, in reality,
Merely a mortal like BROWN, JONES, and SMITH.
Briefly, I classed you with ORSON'S friend VALENTINE,
ROBINSON CRUSOE, and heroes of BALLANTYNE.
Now that the years have brought hairs that are silvery,
Ills that are painful, and views that are fresh,
Only in one thing unchanged, I am still very
Anxious to look upon you in the flesh.
Last time I saw you not (owing to gout) at all.
SQUILLS would not hear of my venturing out at all.
WILLIAM, I'm loth to examine futurity,
Speak as a prophet regarding your show,
Say if the pageant is doomed to obscurity,
Or, on the contrary, if it will "go,"
Whether 'twill charm or displease, when we view it, us.
Accurate forecasts are very fortuitous.
Still, when your ochred and plume-covered savagea
Make preparations for raising the hair,
And when your Cowboys are stemming their ravages,
I, it may please you to know, shall be there.
One, if no more, of the thousands who pen you in
Looks on your feats with a pleasure that's genuine.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Fitzfoode (a beginner, who is "teaching " a lady on the men's links, and loses a club). "PARDON ME, SIR. HAVE YOU SEEN A LADY'S
CLDB ANYWHERE?"
Admiral Peppercorn (very irate at being delayed, wishes ladies would play on their own course). "No, SIB; BUT THEBE 's A GOOSE
CLUB AT THE 'PlQ AND WHISTLE,' I BELIEVE. TUT THAT!"
THE DREAM.
WITH mellow, long, deliberate stroke
Great Tom the midnight silence broke,
And straightway with amoebic clang
The hundred bells of Oxford rang
A merry welcome, blithe and clear,
To usher in the new-born year.
I sat with sported oak—heigho!
How many, many years ago !—
And snoozing in my great arm-chair
With nodding HOMER nodded there.
Scarce had I sunk in slumber deep,
Scarce were my loosened limbs asleep,
When, daring Mrs. Grundy's frown,
And Vice, austere in cap and gown,.
And all the Academic law,
Two maidens entered. One I saw
Was sad and solemn, and I caught
On her pale brow the cast of thought.
Her mien was noble; from her eyes
A great soul shone, ApOLio-wise,
Irradiating all her face
With some sweet, subtle, nameless
grace.
In gorgeous raiment, gaily slashed
With cloth of gold, the other flashed.
Bright diamonds glittered in her hair,
And on her breast were diamonds
rare.
So gay her garb, so strong the light
That sparkled from those facets bright,
So rich and wonderful the lace
I had no thought to mark her face.
She stood beside me. "Follow mo,
And fortune shall be thine," said she.
"For I am Trade, and in my hands
la all the wealth of all the lands.
Fair palaces and gardens gay
To whom I love I give away,
With acres spreading broad; a stud
Of thorough-breds of purest blood,
And flunkeys waiting in the hall
To do their master's bidding—all
That heart of man can want. Be mine,
And great possessions shall be thine."
Then spake the second: "I am Art:
On other things I set my heart:
I strive to win another goal;
She loves the body, I the soul.
With me thou shalt not, lord-like, fare
On dainty meats and vintage rare;
Of things like this thy thoughts are few
When it is given to pursue
The Good, the Beautiful, the True.
Ennobling aims, ideals high,
These shall be thine "—
"Enough!" said I,
"The richer, though the poorer, part
I choose me. I am thine, 0 Art."
To-night again, with sported oak,
I ait in Garden Court and smoke
Beside mv dying fire, and hear
i Big Ben boom in another year,
I While endless bells take up the
tale,
And bid the new-born infant hail.
Upon my knee a sheet lies fair—
For weeks it has been lying there
In faith and patient expectation
Awaiting Art and inspiration.
But she is fickle; she delights
To win herself new proselytes,
The while she leaves me to my
fate—
The terrors of an empty pate.
0 mistress mine, when I reflect
How Trade her minions doth protect,
How King of Corpus drives his pair,
And owns a mansion in Mayfair,
How JONES of Jesus entertains
The peerage on the best champagnes,
(Though KING and JONES were utter
fools,
And scarcely scrambled through their
schools)—
How can I but regret the part
I chose in choosing you, 0 Art,
Upon that New Year's Eve—heigho,
How many, many years ago!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.

IT was daybreak at Delhi, arid tlie domes and minarets of the capital of the Moguls were flushed with auroral
splendours. The vast amphitheatre of the Coronation Durbar, aoon to be thronged with busy workmen hastening
the great work, was deserted save for a solitary figure, rotund with the graceful curves of eternal juvenility and
mounted on a coal-black elephant.
Need it be said that it was Mr. PUNCH, who, true to his character of universal supervisor, was taking a final
look round at the preparations for the great tamasha.
The city of tents lay silent beneath the amber glow of the newly risen sun as Mr. PDNCH passed to the parade
ground. Suddenly he became aware of the approach of a magnificent white elephant, bearing on its back a sumptuously
caparisoned howdah, from the recesses of which peered the bright eyes of the ever vigilant VICEROY, who also was upou
a mission of matutinal surveillance.
"Mr. PUNCH, I presume?" observed the exalted personage.
"Howdah do, your Excellency?" replied the Potentate, condescending to a verbal pleasantry. "I thought to find
no one here, but les beaux esprita ae rencontrent. I hope I see you well."
"You do," responded Lord CURZON. "Nothing has occurred so far to impair my imperdurbarbility.
Excuse me; but your example is infectious." The Sage condoned the indiscretion with a gracious nod, and the
VICEROY continued, " The absence of Mr. W. S. CAINE, M.P., is a surprise, but we submit to it with resignation.
Everything has been done, humanly speaking, to render the function a conspicuous success. The elephants, in Lord
KITCHENER'S phrase, are splendid. The sunshades are like Ascot. It is giving India a great leg-up, I can assure you.
And time too; the world's eye has been upon Africa far too long."
The Sage acquiesced.
"And how are they getting on in England, Mr. PUNCH; for 'what can we know of England who snly India
know ?''
"Well, Sir, I don't think you have missed so very much. We are getting more and more cosmopolitan at home.
Literature monopolised by the Boer Generals. Foreign policy dictated by the Germans. London undermined by
Mr. YERKES."
"But surely Oxford stands where it did?"
"For the present. But, to quote our old friend GALILEO, it moves. The colonists and Americans are upon it, the
RHODES scholars draw nearer every minute."

[DECEMBER 31, 1902.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"Well, speaking as a Fellow of All Souls, I have no tremors as to the result. But you have not finished your
report of home news yet."
"No," said Mr. PUNCH. "There remain three great events—three good things to look back upon: the Peace, the
KINO'S recovery, and his Coronation."
"And now," added Lord CURZON, "India has an Emperor of her own for the first time."
"Well, she deserves it," replied Mr. PUNCH with enthusiasm. "We owe a great deal to India, and I am sure
you could suggest many^tfther ways in which we could profit by her example."
"True," replied the VICEROY. "What we have done for English cricket needs no commendation of mine. But, as
you hint, much might yet be profitably borrowed from the East. The elephant, for example, now that horseflesh seems
likely to be superseded by petrol. I recommend the suggestion to the Surrey magistrates. I see that Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
has been riding on a cow-catcher. How much more impressive would his progress have been had be been mounted on a
cow elephant! Again, why not employ punkahs to ventilate the Tube? If I had not been engaged in my campaign
against absentee Rajahs and white Baboos, reorganising the University system, and nursing my new province—the
G. N. Chersonese as they call it—I should have reported to the Home Government in favour of some or all of these
innovations."
"I fear," said Mr. PUNCH, "that your Excellency is overwhelmed by your multifarious labours."
"Yes," responded the VICEROY, "I am. Formerly I had time to write books; now I have not the leisure even to
read them. Still, my life has its alleviations. The burden of office is heavy, but the VICEREINE"
"Helps," Mr. PUNCH interjected, with a charming smile, "to make it LEITER."
The VICEROY beamed with pleasure. "However," he continued, "when these arduous festivities have been
completed, I propose to give myself a holiday, and then I shall take to reading again."
At this juncture Mr. PUNCH slid from his well-trained steed, clapped his hands thrice, and there immediately
appeared upon the scene from the Sage's chryselephantine pagoda a thousand ebon slaves bearing a handsome filigree
casket, which, with a profound salaam, they deposited at his feet.
"Ah, your Excellency, that reminds me," said Mr. PUNCH, " that I have brought with me a magic gift-—the best
companion for a busy man who has no time to read ordinary books; the best guide to the exile from England who
wishes to know how the old country is faring; the best adviser in all seasons of difficulty and stress; the best tonic for
a mind fatigued; the best token of kindliness that could pass from Bouverie Street to yourself."
At these words the friendly and intelligent pachyderm extended his trunk, and lifted into the air Mr. PUNCH'S
"(in* jpmtbrdr antt Chmttg-t^irtr iolrane."
