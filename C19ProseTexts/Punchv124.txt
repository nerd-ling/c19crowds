TOTHELLO)
South Africa is hardly borne out by the
appearance of the following Report, a
copy of which lately reached us :
1. Resolved that the Commission is
definitely of the opinion that a war
recently took place in South Africa.
2. Resolved that the finding of this
Commission, on the evidence before it,
is to the effect that the war was against
the Boers.
3. Resolved that this Commission is
of opinion that the forethought displayed
by the Secretary of State for War and
his official staff in recognising the out-
break of hostilities, is worthy of remark.
4. Resolved that this Commission
views with grave suspicion the intro-
duction of new methods into the Army.
The Commission feels that it cannot too
strongly endorse the perfect reliability
of the methods wbich have hitherto
been employed, and have proved so
signally successful during the late War.
5. Resolved that in the opinion of this
Commission the Boers used horses, and
that this fact may possibly have involved
some little inconvenience to the British
troops.
6. Resolred that in the opinion of this
Commission the Government's expec-
tation of the capture of Pretoria by
Christmas, 1899, was possibly some-
what premature.
7. Resolved that with regard to indi-
vidual actions, in the opinion of this
Commission a little more resource might
possibly have been shown in the regret-
table Spion Kop incident. That it
appears to the Commission that a likely
solution to the question as to how the
incident occurred, is to be found in the
fact that some slight misunderstanding
arose between the various commanding
officers. Misunderstandings, in the
opinion of this Commission, are inimical

Sometimes I wonder why I am so

flush at the end of my nose, I can find no

HYMEN AND THE HERRINGS.
["The success of the English herring fishing continues to have a
remarkable effect on the matrimonial market. One Sunday the banns
of no fewer than twenty-three fisher couples were published in Buckie
parish church, Banffshire.”-Daily Paper.]
When the giddy little herrings are a-swimming in the sea,
Many fathoms overhead,
Every fisher lad is dreaming
Of the lass that he would wed,
And a-thinking and a-scheming.
But the happy day seems distant, for, arrange it as you will,
It is difficult to marry when your capital is nil.
When the foolish little herrings get entangled in the net
By the tail or by the nose
(But these matters I'm not wise on),
All becomes couleur de rose
On the fisher lad's horizon ;
And a distant sound of wedding bells seems wafted o'er the

As he feels the net each moment growing heavy with the
strain.

FOR ONE WEEK ONLY!
The Durbar has come and gone! No more is the cry of
"Walk up! walk up, just a-goin' to begin!” heard in the
land. Not "a nine days' wonder;” indeed, for the matter of
that, scarcely an inside of a week's wonder. Swift and bril-
liant as a flash of lightning. Et après ? nous verrons. The
magnificent tohu-bohu is at an end, and “the Empire is
Peace.” The tents so striking are now struck; the properties
and “appointments,” in fact the "whole bag of tricks,
toute la boutique,” has been by now packed up. The
costumes are once more stored away in the wardrobes
whence they had been brought out, where they will remain
ticketed, dated, and laid up in lavender until required
for some future Durbar Drama. The carpenters have
cleared the stage; the dancing girls have returned to
their “marble halls”; grooms, ostlers, with handy-men,
are sweeping up the saw-dust; the "supers” have been
paid off, the baby elephant has returned to his cradle; the
big elephants give a sigh of relief on being dismantled (for
they all agreed that “caparisons are odorous”), and their
trumpets sound a joyful note as they resume their ordinary
avocations. All is over, shouting included ; and, as the old
song records of events after the decease of the crafty miller,-
“The world goes on the same as before."
The South African performance is in for a longer run,
the principal character in it having long speeches that
can't possibly be “cut.” But not until Mr. Punch 's

HOW LARGE THOSE HIDDEN HANDS MUST BE !
SEASONABLE SALUTES.
Taking Lord Curzon's hint as to the orientalising of our
institutions, it has been decided to acclimatise the Indian
system of conferring honour by the medium of salutes. We
understand that the following awards have been made :-
Dr. Clifford.-A permanent salute of nine angry canons.
Mr. Chamberlain.–A temporary salute of seventeen screw
guns.
Lord Avebury.-A permanent salute of the hundred best
maxims.
Mr. Louis Wain.---A salvo of Mausers.
Mr. Peter Robinson. -A permanent salute of innumerable
pom-poms.
Messrs. Day and Martin.—A salute of thirteen Whitehead
torpedoes.
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.-A very pretty wedding recently
took place at the Registrar's, Whitechapel. The contracting
parties were Mr. JOE CROWBAR, only son of the late JIM
CROWBAR, who fell gallantly at Newgate, and Miss ’ARRIET
SMITH. The bride, who wore as her only ornament a lovely
black eye, a recent gift of the bridegroom, looked charming
in her Worth (not much) gown, and hat with large feathers.
After the ceremony the happy couple left by Underground
Railway for King's Cross en route for Haggerston, where
the honeymoon will be spent.
A SORE POINT.
It was perfectly clear I was out of the running,
My mortification I could not disguise,
They paced in the shadow, the company shunning,
Soul leaping to soul, through their eloquent eyes.
Devotion of years had I lavished in vain,
But the luck took a turn-when he trod on her train.
There sounded a rip, as if stitches were slitting,
The lady herself was brought up with a jerk;
He smiled his excuses, facetiously fitting
The little mishap with a humorous quirk.
Poor innocent fool!-I emerged from my gloom,
For I read in her look his immutable doom.
Her peach-blossom face wore a look so malignant,
His dexterous epigram faltered and failed,
Her eye scattered lightnings forbidding, indignant,
His ardour was quenched and his countenance paled,
While she riddled his length with a fire of disdain,
From his head to his foot (on her gossamer train).
So--she took me instead-and our days pass serenely;
I look out for breakers and mind where I steer;
She sweeps o'er the carpet majestic and queenly,
I follow-a yard and a half in the rear;
My duties are heavy, but perfectly plain :
To work for her, love her, and keep off her train.

certain that the Pantomime at “The Lane” is as great a

brilliant predecessors. “For this relief much thanks" to

THERE is no mistaking the sounds
proceeding from behind the little crowd
that has gathered across the top of the
next turning. Those vigorous blows,
accompanied by that exultant nasal |
war-cry, can only be associated with the
needy elder brother of the prosperous
gentleman so complacently drawing
pictures in the midst of a nightmare on
the cover of this volume. I join the
little group and soon become absorbed
in the moving drama of life and death
(principally death-which is very popu-

me.
Punch, a tow-headed malefactor with
a dental grin, has just in rollicking
fashion beaten out the brains of three
inquisitive but otherwise innocent
strangers, and light-heartedly laid their
remains head downwards across the
window-ledge, which done, he observes,
“Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!” with a
kind of reminiscent joviality, and pauses
to give the audience a chance to have
their laugh out. To him enters a fourth
stranger, in all matters of character
exactly resembling his predecessors, but
bearing the distinction of a mahogany

Sophistical dialectics follow between him and Punch. -
“How-can the dog-be yours, Sir,” concludes Toby's
owner, “ if I- lost him?”
“How can the dog be yours, Sir," returns Punch with
spasmodic sophisory, “if I found him ?”.
Toby's owner is evidently sensible that he has met his
match in reasoning powers. But he continues with jerky
resolution :
"It was a fort--night ago--last Tuesday—that I--lost 'im."
“It was a fortnight ago last Tuesday,” returns Punch
(somewhat undiplomatically, as it seems to me), “that I
found ’im.''
The deliberate citizen refusing to be convinced by argu-
ment, Punch again has recourse to the cudgel. I notice a
diminution in the applause, and look about me in surprise.
Then I find that Gasworks has left my side and penetrated
deeper into the crowd, where he is sowing discontent.
“Where's Judy ?” he demands in an aggressive shout;
“woddyer wanter call it Punch an' Judy for?”.
A good many of the crowd seem to realise the justice of
this complaint.
“Yes, why ain't there no Judy ? ” inquires a woman
with a black eye of a companion with a baby.
“Why?” cries Gasworks, emboldened by success. “Becos
they cawn't do Judy. They ain't clever enough-that's
why."
"It ain't wot it used ter be, is it?” remarks the woman
with the baby.“Why they used ter throw Judy's baby

The woman with the black eye seems quite convinced as
to the decadence of the drama, and several of the bystanders
seem to be of the same way of thinking. The entertainment

One of the best is the tunic game.
You take a large piece of paper and a

the pencil over the paper. You then
open your eyes, and send this design
to the War Office as the new pattern
for braid, or lace, on the sleeves, or the
shoulders, or any other part of the
tunic, which every officer must obtain
within a week. The most amusing part
of the game follows. You close your
eyes again, and move the pencil in a
different way. You then send this
second pattern to the War Office, to be
issued eight days after, as the one
absolutely essential and inviolable
pattern for every officer in every part
of the British Empire. This is really

AT:SMITH
HOW TO GET ON.
No. V.—IN AMERICA.
(Concluded.)
Last week I landed you safely in the Home of the Free,
and by this time you will have been able to turn round and
find your legs, as it were, and accustom yourself to the
society of this strange and on the whole delightful people
who, with the English language on their lips, carry the
heart of a Frenchman on their sleeves, and have deep down
in their breasts another heart of their own, a heart compact
of fine pride and generous feeling, and gusts of sensitive
resentment and shrinking reticence that no Spanish Hidalgo
could match. It is a curious mixture, but there it is, and
the sooner you come to recognise it the better it will be for
your welfare in the country you are visiting.
Perhaps the first thing to be done is to accustom yourself
to the idea that Americans have of the average Englishman.
Everybody knows what you think of yourself. You are the
only man in the world, the measure of perfection, the
standard of the greater virtues, the rule by which excellence
in the art of living and of behaving oneself is to be tested.
You have never really thought about this : you have gently
but firmly assumed it to be true and, not only true, but
recognised as true by every other nation. You are clever,
polished, brilliant, well-versed in the art of dress and the
great points of conduct-in a word you 're a model. That's
your idea. Put it away from you, get rid of it, bury it
deep underground and don't resurrect it until you 're back
in Liverpool. The Americans are a polite people, but you
can't be long in their society or read their newspapers and

MR. PUNCH'S SKETCHY
INTERVIEWS.
XI.-MR. SIDNEY LEE.
MR. LEE was pensively toying with a
crisp rasher as we entered his sump-
tuous apartments in Verulam Buildings,
Ham Common.
"Sit down and feed, and welcome to
our table,” he remarked, pleasantly.
We replied that we had eaten already,
but that we hoped he would continue.
"On, bacons, on," he rejoined, plac-
ing two more slices in the chafing dish
at his side. “What, ye knaves! Young
men must live.”
While he finished his repast we had
time to look round our host's comfort-
able quarters. The shelves bristled
with editions of the Master's works
bound in the best pigskin : the Novum
Organum, the Wisdom of the Ancients,
the Advancement of Learning, the
“In saying so you shall but say the
truth,” responded the eminent critic,
adding, with a sudden descent to the
more pedestrian diction of the Dictionary
of National Biography, “Evidences of
the truth of the great doctrine abound
in all ages. CICERO had a villa at
Tusculum. DISRAELI took the title of
Beaconsfield, and GLADSTONE himself sat
for Greenwich, which rhymes with
spinach, which is inextricably associated
with gammon, which rhymes with
Salmon, which is equivalent to Gluck-
STEIN, which is the German for GLADSTONE.
The wheel has come full circle; the
loop is looped. Yes, we are all Pro-
bores now."
Before we left, Mr. LEE kindly gave
us some interesting particulars of his
life. Born at Hog's Norton in Leices-
tershire, he was intended for a Shak-
spearian scholar, but at an early age,

" In saying so you shall but say the truth."
"Age cannot wither nor custom stale
his infinite variety,'' murmured Mr. LEE.
“And your life of SHAKSPEARE ? That,
then, is the narrative of the Lord
Chancellor's most carefully maintained
deception?”
"A showing of a heavenly effect in an
earthly actor,” our host replied..
“Then you hold that not only is Ham
Common but everything is Bacon, and
Bacon is everything? You are but a
projection of Bacon's personality; and
we are Bacon and Bacon is every-
where?”
“I have unclasped to thee the book,
even of my secret soul,” replied Mr. LEE
in his most poignant accents.
“In other words, then, the philosophy
of the Baconians is eternal and omni-
present Gammon?”

“Mr. Lee was pensively toying with a
crisp rasher.'

Essays, the New Atlantis-none were
missing. Portraits of the great man
covered the walls, varied here and there
by the effigies of kindred spirits : a full-
length (by TROTTER, R.A.) of Og, King
of Bashan ; a photograph of Mrs. GALLUP
in one of her rasher moments; an
engraving of the Ettrick Shepherd; a
Kit-Cat of IGNATIUS DONNELLY; and a
charming carte de visite of Mr. MALLOOK
in fancy dress as a Franciscan friar.
"And do you,” we asked, “think
that BACON wrote everything?”
Mr. LEE signified assent in the usual
manner.
"How simple that must make things!”
we replied. "" Then the Dictionary of
National Biography is merely a life of
Bacon's aliases?"
“A priceless Mexican Mustang has been
retained for his exclusive use."
perceiving the hollowness of the Great
Stratford Myth, as he calls it, he turned
his attention to cryptograms, and with
the assistance of Sir THOMAS LIPTON--
who first divined the inner significance of
the names Ham-let and Polony-us-and
of Mr. J. Holt SCHOOLING, he discovered a
cipher which revolutionised our know-
ledge of the Elizabethan Age, proving
beyond doubt that The Visits of
Elizabeth was the work of FRANCIS
Bacon in his character as the Earl of
LEICESTER, and Elizabeth and her Ger-
man Garden an effusion of the same
author under the disguise of Sir WALTER
RALEIGH.

LAST week there was no Austrian
Imperial scandal.

German Ambassador at Washington,

himself there. He has declared he is
often told he is as much of an American
as the average American, as he was
born in England, his mother was Scotch,
his wife comes from Kentucky, his
father was a German, and he is going

It has been proposed that, as a com-
pensation for the hardship of having

Mr. TILLMAN, Lieutenant-Governor of
South Carolina, has shot a newspaper
editor. It is thought he will be repri-

A printer's error, which caused it to
be stated in a newspaper that the South

millionaires to write and say they are

HOW IT AROSE.
It was bruited about everywhere that AUGUSTUS BROWN
had made a most unhappy marriage, and that conse-
quently misery was in store for him. So everybody sighed,
"Poor BROWN !” Yet Gus Brown and his bride were as
happy as the day was long, or short, it mattered not which.

How was this false rumour of Brown's misery started ?
Very simply.
Mrs. Robinson, a most hospitable and very impulsive lady,
delights in giving verbal invitations at short notice. Seeing
Brown walking along Piccadilly, on Monday, Mrs. ROBINSON
stopped her carriage, and suddenly startled him out of a
reverie by cheerily asking him to dine with her on Wednes-
day.
"Awfully sorry,” replied Brown, apparently rather taken
aback, and unusually nervous, “but the-er--fact is I'm
unhappily engaged-and-er "
“Thought I should have caught you,” interrupted Mrs. R.,
who had no time to waste on explanations. “Ta! ta!” and
ordered her coachman to drive on.
She had not proceeded far, when it suddenly struck her
that BROWN had not appeared to be quite himself, that he
seemed depressed, and, somehow, that his manner altogether
had implied much more than he had said when telling
her he was “unfortunately engaged.” Then she began

PILGRIMS TO THE EAST.
VI.—THE DURBAR — AND AFTER.
January 8: Viceroy's Camp, Delhi.
- The little moon that emerged on the
eve of the Durbar was not the simple
thing it looked to be. I had always
supposed that the appearance of these
heavenly bodies was determined a cen-
tury or so in advance by the almanacks.
Yet the sight of this new moon seems
to have come as a surprise-certainly it
modified the arrangements for the feast
of Ramadan-and in some obscure way
necessitated the postponement of the
Durbar by the space of half an hour.
Personally I am ill-versed in local
creeds, and should myself have thought
that a distinct engagement like the
Durbar should not have been affected
by anything short of an eclipse. I have
no further criticism to offer on the pro-
ceedings, except that I think that some
few score of the salutes might have
been taken as fired, or else let off at
such a distance as not to delay the
action of this imposing drama. For
the rest I cannot conceive a more
admirably ordered spectacle.
The scene in the vast verandahed
amphitheatre, opening out across the
sithe-marit
plain upon a vista of long avenues of
foot and horse, British and native, was The Nizam of Hyderabad and other notabilities playing “The Heavy Lead" in the

Dear little lad, how well I can
Recall your face, brimful of fun,
A baby and a grown-up man
Delightfully combined in one.
A man compared to MARGARET,
Your tiny sister, agèd two,
Yet Mother bade you not forget
How brothers big looked down on you.
At table how sedate you sat,
Obeyed dear Mother, never fought her,
Yet how, just five, you chortled at
The shilling pump with real water,-
The penny squirts that Mother bought,
(“We boys shall use them,” so you said)
The river where you always sought
For“ business boats,” decked out in

Dear little lad, before you grow
As big a boy as each big brother,
Come up again to see us—though
Please don't forget to bring dear

£000 A WEEK FOR LIFE!!
· A UNIQUE OFFER !!!
(See this week's “Snippy Bits.”)
It is almost impossible to realise
what such a prize means, but the
following facts will perhaps enable you
to grasp its magnitude.
£000 a week for life means :-*
That you can breathe as much air as
you can possibly get.
That you can give it all away to a needy
friend without reducing your
income.
That, if you are a careful business man,
you can double it in a few weeks.
That, if you are an extravagant woman,
you can never possibly spend it.
That it exempts you from any addi-
tional Income Tax.
That, if placed in a bank, you can
never overdraw your account.
In fact, there is no limit to the things
you can't do with £000 a week for life.

of regret, even in that first expansive moment of renewed
friendship, but I forbore to correct him.
“How did you manage it?" I inquired instead.
His answer was pathetically absurd. He had searched
directories, it appeared, and inquired in all sorts of unlikely
quarters. In fact, for some years an appreciable portion of

that I had nothing whatever to say to him. We had not
met for years. We had no friends, no interests, in common.

“SUPPORT HOME INDUSTRIES.”
THERE are who say that England's art,
Her enterprise, her gift of trade,
Hustled by men from foreign parts,
Are on the steady downward grade.
We man with strange imported stuff
The ships that held the world in fee ;
Our latest diplomatic bluff-
We got it made in Germany!
Our local artists lie a-cold,
Or walk the street disguised as tramps,
While alien fists affect to mould
The bust upon our postage stamps.
When the musician's hand is heard
Extracting strains without an air,
There's always some exotic bird
Building amid his matted hair.
Or look at SHAKSPEARE's native field !
Does it not cause our pride a wrench
To find Pinero's humour yield
To farces lifted from the French ?
Or pass to those more crucial things
That made us what we--used to be;
Regard the Yankee making “rings”.
All round the race that ruled the Sea !
They run our fleets; our tubes they lay;
From them we likewise learn the trick
Of selling little twists of hay
To make the little smoker sick.
But, worse than all (and here I strike
A note too deep for ribald rhyme),
They say the immigrant is like
To cut us out in point of crime !
Statistics prove the appalling fact
That in the artful dodger's game
These others show a verve and tact
That puts our connoisseurs to shame.
In vacant hall or social crush
Where plate is pinched or purses leck,
The foreign artist brings a blush
Upon the native's brazen cheek.
Here surely we should draw the line ;
It is a case-I feel it is-
Where honest men might well combine
In aid of local industries.
I care not much though alien folk
In other spheres assume the van ;
But he that wants to pick my poke
Must be a true-born Englishman.
Free Trade I call a noble creed;
I'd hate to see that fetish crack;
And yet at times I think we need
The other kind of commerce back.
As buds that fear an April gale~
Ask them to face the cold, -they can't ;
They need Protection, being frail, -
Such is the British burglar's plant.
LOWTHER! on you I urge his claim,
To you this task of love assign;
So in the heavens by the name
Of “Burglan's JEMMY” vou shall shine!
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Paying a sort of flying-fish visit to the West Indies, my
Baronite happed upon A Narrative of a Journey up the Caura
River, by E. ANDRÉ. The Caura flows through trackless
pathways of Guiana. Since the time of WALTER RALEIGH
it has ever fascinated explorers. Spaniards dreamed of a
golden city somewhere on its banks. Three centuries ago
expedition after expedition left the plateau of Quito in
search of it. Raleigh, in his work describing the Discovery
of Guiana, chronicles a report (" for my own part I am
resolved is true”) that the dwellers by the banks of the
Caura “have their eyes in their shoulders, their mouths in
the middle of their breasts, a long train of hair growing
backward between their shoulders.” Is this, by the way,
the source of SHAKSPEARE's dream of
Men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders ?
Mr. André, accompanied by seven men, including two expert
hunters, started on his adventurous journey on November 29,
1900. On May 22 in the following year a boat-load of
starved human beings, transformed beyond recognition,
reached the settlement nearest to the trackless waste over
which some of them had literally crawled back. Returning
after making their way southward as far as the moun-
tain Ameha, their dugout was wrecked in one of the
numerous rapids through which the Caura storms its way
to join the Orinoco. With the wreck went all the hardly
earned treasures of the journey—a collection of birds (some
novel to mankind), seeds, insects, herbarium specimens, and
ANDRÉ's journal, containing precious notes, the work of
months. Fever-stricken, famished, the prey of insects, some
cutting their way through trackless forests, others hourly
facing the peril of shipwreck in a crank dugout, they
doggedly won their way back to civilisation. The book,
printed in a local newspaper office in Trinidad, is accom-
panied by a portfolio of 29 photographs taken on the spot.
It deserves a wider circle of readers than this form of intro-
duction is likely to secure for it. An enterprising London
publisher might find it worth looking up.
In A Castle in Spain (SMITH, Elder & Co.), Mr. BERNARD
Capes has given us a romance of thrilling interest. Many
of the dramatic situations are such as GUSTAVE Doré, or,
before him, GEORGE CRUIKSHANK, would have seized upon
as offering great chances. The scene, in the latter part of
the story, where the dwarf--a veritable “Dwarf of Blood,"
to quote the signature to some of the raciest articles in a
certain pink publication-performs prodigies of valour, would
have furnished either of the above-mentioned artists with a
splendid opportunity for their blackest and whitest. The
writer's style is reminiscent of THACKERAY in Esmond, of
ANTHONY HOPE, of “Q,” and in certain parts of GEORGE
MEREDITH, especially when his epigram tends towards ob-
scurity. To get all these authors at their best in one novel
is no small achievement; yet it is a salad of which the
peculiarly attractive flavour is the author's own secret.
Taken for all in all, it is one of the very best romances the
Baron has come across for some considerable time.
A stimulating commencement characterises GEORGE GRIF-
FITH's The World Masters (JOHN LONG), but the interest is
allowed to drop until the eighth chapter, when it is revived,
yet only for a while. “Ah!” sighs the Baron, “to what
sensational uses would not Sherlock Holmes have put the
material that this author had at his command ? But 'such
an honest chronicler as GRIFFITH' will soon give us some-
thing better, something more stirring. So till then, GRIFFITH,
farewell !--nay-Patience! till his next romance,"quoth the

III. — THE SOCIAL STATISTICIAN.
“Just now,” said our host, settling
himself further in his chair, “my studies
are taking me into two very different
channels : I am inquiring into cabs and
wedding-presents. The idiosyncrasies
of persons of eminence who ride in cabs
are well worthy of patient investigation
in the pursuit of those data by which
character is ascertained. It may never
have occurred to you that one man rides
differently from another; but so it is.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, for example, when riding
alone always sits in the middle of the
seat and leans back. Mr. ASQUITH sits
in the middle of the seat and leans
forward. Lord ROSEBERY, Mr. MORLEY,
and Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE subside into the
left corner. Sir MICHAEL Hicks-BEACH,
Mr. GIBSON BOWLES and Lord Huga CECIL
subside into the right. Sir John GORST
folds his arms. The Duke of DEVON-
SHIRE closes his eyes. Lord SALISBURY
forgets his destination. Sir HENRY
M .
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN takes two cabs and
runs between them. Mr. WYNDHAM
adjusts his moustaches in the glass.
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL changes places
with the driver.
“Then as to methods of payment-
these also are full of character. Sir
EDWARD GREY pushes the fare through
the hole in the roof : Mr. LABOUCHERE
pays in new sixpences; Mr. DILLON has
an argument with the cabman; Mr.
PIERPONT MORGAN asks for discount.”
The Statistician paused for breath.
“It is very interesting,” we remarked,
"and certainly of the highest value.
You mentioned wedding presents ...?”
“Oh, yes. The investigator has a

JOSEPHO AFRICANO.
LIKE Spring that calls the swallow,
With bud and bloom to follow,
For weary hearts and hollow
Piping a winsome strain,
Till tears and laughter choke us,
And tingling veins provoke us
To gambol with the crocus-
You come, you come again!
A prey to pure emotion,
The amorous waves of ocean
Have formed the happy notion
To fleck your cheeks with foam ;
The salt sea-winds have kissed you-
How could they well resist you ? -
And we, ah we have missed you ! .
O welcome, welcome home!
What with the Times so stirring,
And awkward things occurring,
And hope's prolonged deferring
To make us deadly sick,
So much your voice was needed
To get our motions heeded
That even AUSTEN pleaded,
“O father, do be quick !”
The few your faith relies on
Directed haggard eyes on
The sea's remote horizon
So dim and vast and wet ;
And when they heard a blizzard
They trembled in the gizzard,
Saying “It is, it is hard
Luck if he gets upset."
Colleagues, unwont to squander
Their love on you, grew fonder,
And widow-like would ponder
Upon their absent dear;
With every new disaster
Their loving hearts went faster,
Yearning towards the Master-
“If he were only here!
Now malice, once bedridden
Upon her native midden,
Has washed herself and bidden
The feast your fame has earned,
Who, through a hottish season,
Induced the ranks of treason
To bow to words of reason-
Until your back was turned.
Sedition leagued and banded
You countered single-handed
With lectures strangely candid
And wit supremely deft ;
For still your stature rises
Equal to all surprises,
Reaching us many sizes
Larger than when you left!
In wounds that gaped defiance
At merely human science
With god-like self-reliance
You plugged the timely stitch ;
You taught the Boar and Lion

"THE CHILD IS FATHER OF THE MAN.”
["He was singing, and I told him to leave
off," said a boy the other day, speaking of his
father, whom he was charging with assault at
the Marylebone Police Court. In answer to
the magistrate the son insisted on his right to
control the actions of his father.]
"...... You are wanted in the

message at the library door.

"Who by?” asked the man faintly,
his face assuming a deadly pallor.
“Your son, of course," replied the
girl, adding, “And you'd better go
quick, or I can tell you you 'll catch it!”
Needing no second bidding, the man
started to his feet, rushed upstairs, and
knocked timorously at the nursery
door.
For a moment no notice was taken.
Then a voice called, “ Come in!”
The trembling father entered, ad-
vanced with downcast head, and stood
before his stern seven-year-old son.
" Why were you so long ?”.
“Please -1-1-didn't know you

"Didn't know! You'd no business

[The sporting instinct is now so keen among
girls that a man who gallantly moderates his
hitting in mixed hockey is merely regarded
as an incapable slacker by his fair opponents.]
WHEN first I played hockey with KITTY,
I was right off my usual game,
For she looked so bewitchingly pretty
When straight for the circle she came;
As a rule I'm not backward, or chary
Of hitting and harassing too,
But who can be rough with a fairy-
Not I-so I let her go through.
She scored, and we couldn't get equal,
The others all thought me a fool,
And KITTY herself, in the sequel,
Grew most unexpectedly cool.
They gave us a licking, as stated,
I was sick at the sight of the ball,
She thought me a lot over-rated,
And wondered they played me at all.
But she frankly approved PERCY WATERS,
Who uses his stick like a flail,
And always impartially slaughters
Both sexes, the strong and the frail ;
A mutual friendliness followed,
I watched its career with dismay-
Next match-day my feelings I swallowed,
And hit in my orthodox way.
I caught her a crunch on the knuckle,
A clip on the knee and the cheek,
She said, with a rapturous chuckle,
"I see — you weren't trying last

When it brings consolation to both,
For after she'd counted her bruises

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 9.
-Although of aldermanic race there is
nothing in the appearance of Sir EDWIN
DURNING-LAWRENCE, Bart., suggestive of
Mr. Pickwick's acquaintance the Fat

making the flesh creep, he runs that im-
mortal youth uncommonly close. Long

appearance this afternoon. Prayers just

with chastened spirit, at peace with all
men. The Irish landlord looked with
softened glance across the floor at a
quarter, for obvious reason empty at
the moment, where representatives of
Irish tenants sit. Millennium was at
hand. He (the landlord) is to receive
full value for his property; the tenant
is to pay twenty per cent. less than its
market price, and the British taxpayer
will, out of his sorely drained pocket,
supply the difference.

THE EVOLUTION OF FATNESS.
[Dr. ROBINSON, in the North American Rc-
viero, asks, “Why should babies be fat, when
the children of their pithecoid ancestors must
have been lean ? ... The suicidal swallowing
capacity of the modern baby is an inheritance
from the habits of the crawling cave-dweller."]
“Baby boy, whose visage chubby

· Why are you so fat ?
“How unlike your rude forefather-
Prehistoric, pithecoid!
Who with nuts he chanced to gather
Filled his aching void ;
“ Who, whenever hunger goaded,
Ate to please the passing mood,
Nor his stomach overloaded
With some patent food.
“No! but later generations
Come, in which the infant staves
Hunger off by dint of rations
Picked up in the caves.

Grasping all with eager fist,-

bridge is to all appearances deserted,
save for a party of homegoing revellers
singing the latest pantomime song, who
have just passed me to fade away next
moment into mere voices in the

gaze with aching eyes into the dark
void, somewhere beyond which the
hungry river is moving on in awful
silence. The pantomime chorus in the
distance grows muffled and feeble, then
expires. I am alone in Infinity.
A shout from below, but whether
from the river or the bank I cannot tell.
The shout is repeated again and again.
I turn and hasten towards the end of
the bridge, then grope my way through
two posts that suddenly rise up out of
the fog before me, and down a steep
slope towards the tow path. The shout-
ing grows louder, and resolves itself
into something approaching intelligi-
bility.
"Hi-i-i! Urray urra-a-ay! Hi-i-i-i-i!”
I draw nearer. The shouting swells
to a roar. The next moment a dark
figure looms out of the fog--the figure
of a man leaning against the fence at

hitched round the top rail, and yelling

[According to a recent number of llarper's Weekly Mrs. W. D.
MOCLINTOCK, of the Department of English at the University of Chicago,
has declared that such nursery tales as Jack and the Beanstalk and
Bluebeard have a "moral squint" about them, and are unfit for childish
reading. She has mapped out a really moral literary course for the
mother to superintend during her children's infancy. The main
features are here faithfully reproduced.]

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GREAT MISUNDERSTOOD.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-In view of the fact
that representatives of the British Parlia-
ment have been invited to visit Canada
during the Easter Recess, I beg to make
a few suggestions and offer some hints
that will be found of the highest value.
When the august company arrives at
Halifax it will be met by Mr. PARKIN
and others, who will attempt to present
an address expressing their satisfaction
"at this further evidence of the spread
of Imperial ideas”; but the committee
should begin right by firmly refusing
to accept addresses between meals. This
will not only insure them a sufficiency
of banquets, but save them from water-
brash on the brain, due to an over-
indulgence in illuminated rhetoric,
When passing through Montreal and
Quebec the visitors must step lightly
so as to “let sleeping dogs lie." While
in Montreal they should not fail to visit
the ruins of the Ice Palace, which is still
freezing the reputation of the country,
though a dozen years have passed since
it was built.
When visiting Toronto in order to
receive the homage of the Orange
Lodges they will probably be waited on
by ă deputation from the Canadian
Club, whose members will sing the new
Imperial song, “The Red Tape of Old
England.” As this song promises to
become a favourite in all the Colonies, the
visitors should listen to it attentively.
It will not be necessary to visit
Ottawa, as most of the Knights who
make up its population have already
been on exhibition in England.
After banqueting at Winnipeg the
explorers should leave the railway line

These interesting conveyances are very

that the traveller gets the whole spring

This was a crumb of comfort bestowed

LIGHT AND LEARNING.
["It is reported from Vienna that an Austrian
scientist has invented a method of obtaining
light from microbes.”—Daily Press.]
With his usual “intelligent anticipa-
tion” of events Mr. Punch foresees in
the future some such paragraphs as the
following:
The new Microbean Installation on
the Embankment is giving great satis-
faction. Of the various experimental
illuminants the Influenza light has been
found to be the most penetrating; its
only practical defect is that it makes
everything appear extremely blue.
On the occasion of the fifth anniver-
sary of the relief of Mafeking the
illumination of St. George's Hospital
attracted universal admiration. The
entire façade of the building was out-
lined with Mumps and Chicken-pox in
fairy-lamps, while a singularly fine
effect was produced by the employment
of a tubercular search-light on the roof.
The alarming failure of the Bacterial
system throughout the West-End last
evening is said to have been the result
of a deliberate outrage. It is supposed
that the miscreants must have obtained
admission to the central office and placed
disinfectants in the generators. The

PHENOMENAL HEROINISM!
(A Historical Fragment.)
(Under the heading “Fashionable Lady's
Daring Innovation," a daily paper recently
described, in half a column of wonderment,
the apparition in the West End on the previous
afternoon of a bonnet with dark green strings
tied in a double bow slightly to the left of the
chin of a lady most neatly and elegantly dressed,
and still obviously and undeniably young; a
tiny cluster of spring flowers adorning the
“confection."]
The Kalends of April, Anno Domini
Nineteen-Hundred-and-Three, was an
epoch-making date in the history of the
British Empire.
At half-past three o'clock on that
afternoon à rumour spread like wild-
fire from end to end of the metropolis
to the effect that a strange and startling
spectacle of a feminine nature was to
be observed in Bond Street.
In a few minutes the Tube and
suburban lines were blocked with
streams of hurrying and perspiring
quidnuncs; the service of buses had to
be trebled and quadrupled on all roads
converging to the above-named focus of
fashion ; extra drafts of police were
hastily telephoned for from outlying
districts; and by four o'clock the crush
was so immense in this particular
quarter that all traffic and circulation
was impossible.
Things began to look ugly, and the
crowd was getting out of hand, when

“Where ignorance is bliss,
'Tis folly to be wise."
The time-gun rolls his nerve-destroying bray;
The toiling moon rides slowly o'er the trees;
The weary diners cast their cares away,
And seek the lawn for coolness and for ease.
Now fade the lessening echoes on the night,
And melancholy silence rules the scene,
Save where the bugler sounds, with conscious might,
And thirsty Thomas leaves the wet canteen;
Save that from yonder lines in deepest gloom
Th' ambiguous mule does of the stick * bewail,
Whose dunder craft forbids him to consume
His comrade's blanket, or his neighbour's tail.
Beneath those jagged tiles, that low-built roof,
(Whose inmost secret deeps let none divine !),

The cold boiled rice, in native butter greased;
Nor scorn, with rising gorge and painful smile,
The cheap but filling flapjacks of the East.

Those grim unleavened cates would overweigh;
* The dunder-stick-an ingenious instrument devised to defeat this
extraordinary appetite.
Full many a “dish to set before the Queen”
Would lack the substance of that poor display.
Nor you, their lords, expect of these the toil,
When o'er their minds a soft oblivion steals,
And through the long-drawn hookah's pliant coil
They soothe their senses, and digest their meals.
For Knowledge to their ears her ample store,
Rich with the latest news, does then impart,
Whose source, when known, shall chill you to the core,
And freeze the genial cockles of the heart.
For once, to long neglectfulness a prey,
Resentment led me undetected near,
To “know the reason ” of this cool delay,
And teach my trusty pluralist to hear.
There to my vassals' ruminating throng,
Some total stranger, seated on a pail,
Perused, translating as he went along,
My private letters by the current Mail.
One moment, horror baulked my strong intent;
Next o'er the compound wall we saw him go,
While dismal shrieks, with deprecation blent,
Deplored the pressing tribute of the toe.
The Moral.
To you, fresh youths, with round, unblushing cheeks,
Some moral tag this closing verse applies ;
E'en from the old the voice of Wisdom speaks-
Even the youngest are not always wise!
From Exploration's curious arts refrain,
The alluring fields of Orient lore eschew :
Lest you should learn-nor ever smile again ! -
The dubious customs of the mild Hindoo. Dum-Dum.

A propos of the Army an echo of the
past is sounded to-day by the announce-
ment that the War Office have decided
to proceed immediately to the distribu-

gained in the Boer War of 1899-1902.
Descendants of heroes engaged in that
campaign are requested to apply forth-

“Long-Bow" writes to say that he is
still able to recollect seeing, when a very
little boy, a domestic servant working
in a kitchen. He says that “this eccen-

for the privileges of her station, and
declined to join her fellow domestics in

pamphlets on the subject, and directed
my attention to articles upon it in the
more expensive magazines.
The seed fell on good ground, and I
became a convert. Many bachelors do.
Indeed, the advantages of so doing are
obvious. The Simpler Life relieves you
from the necessity of wearing a frock-
coat, or paying afternoon calls, or leaving
cards'after a dinner party. It is in fact
quite an old theory of social behaviour
which used to bear a less high-sound-
ing name. It aims at abolishing snob-
bery and ostentation. Thus, liveried
menials are prohibited by it. These I
was easily induced to forego. It dis-
countenances formality of all kinds.
Hence the disappearance of calls and
card-leaving and similar nuisances. In
fact, there are quite a number of ordi-
nary social customs and duties on
which The Simpler Life looks with dis-
favour. All these I steadfastly abjured.
Indeed, had I remained a bachelor, I
am inclined to think I might have
achieved a certain pre-eminence as a
Simpler Liver.
Instead of this I married.
Now the Simpler Life inevitably
tends to make more converts among
bachelors than among married men.

of matrimony which is essentially
hostile to it. Yet when I married

JOSEPH as a shy and reserved child."-British
Weekly.]
Some people think success is due
To vulgar shove and push,
But let me, please, impress on you
That good wine needs no bush.
The common creed I quite deny:)
JOE CHAMBERLAIN was ever shy.
You wonder how I did the trick
And managed to become,
Like Drury Lane's immortal Dick,
Thrice Mayor of mighty Brum ?
Some murmur, “Push!”—but I reply,
From boyhood I was ever shy.
You ask how I became M.P.,
And how contrived to get
The place of pride from which, you see,
I boss the Cabinet ?
Again some whisper, “ Push !”—but I
Repeat that I was ever shy.
You ask why my ambitious soul
Desires to take in charge
The British Empire, as a whole,
And rule the world at large ?
Absurd to talk of push! Pray, try
To realise that I am shy.

A FRAGMENT.
That is to say, I might have been a
fragment by now, if—but I anticipate.
Dining with my friend BANKS, an
enthusiastic motorist, we spoke much
of the Paris-Madrid race.
“I'm going to have a run over part
of the track," said he ; "come with me
for a few miles ? I'll pick you up near
Bayonne, and take you as far as the
Spanish frontier, say, at Irun, and you
can alight there " curiously enough, I
did, but not quite in the way I wanted to).
"We shall have some rare fun together.”
We had.
At the time appointed I journeyed
out to Bayonne and awaited the passing
of BANKS. A wire announced the hour
of his arrival, and punctually to time a
dust-covered infernal machine, accom-
panied by a stench of petrol strong
enough to lean up against, tore down
the hill to where I waited, holding my
bag. I held out my hand.
“How are you, my dear fel—-- ?".
“Jump in!” yelled the creature in

“not a moment to spare!”

Then that's all settled. Silence gives consent !

But-but I offered twenty-five! My cook ?
Ah, yes! No doubt you-er--you overheard.
Oh, not at all. My fault! of course you see
How very different the cases are.
I know it isn't-yes, I quite agree,
In fact I've told my husband more than once
That Education really does come first.
But then, what can one do? The fact remains,
Good cooks are scarce, and governesses swarm,
And so, poor things, one has to pay them less,
One really has no choice! Besides-Good-bye!

(A Matter of Taste.)
GOOD-BYE then, Mary, if you really must ?
You 're sure you—? Very well then. Anyhow
I'm rather busy. No. I've got to see
A dreadful female. Worse! A governess !
For Aloy, yes. You know he's nearly eight,
And getting quite beyond-I wish I could !
I don't know how to manage him one bit.
My dear, a little demon. That's the truth
His temper's simply vile, and as for lies
You can't believe a single word he says.
His manners too! But what can one expect,
Considering the way his father-well,
You know what Jack is.
Oh, this woman? No.
I saw about her in the Morning Post :
She's recommended by a Lady H.,
Whoever she may be: a fraud, no doubt.
But anyhow I wrote-was that the bell ?
Yes! Then you 'd better go. I never keep
These sort of people waiting. Here she coines.
Adieu, ma chérie, then. Oh-How d’ye do?
Excuse me for a moment I forgot!
That cook you spoke of. Is she very dear?
Jack 's rather-only fifty ? Oh dear, no:
That's not a bit too much. I'll write at once.
Oh! what about the Duchess's to-night ?
Then au revoir. I'll come. Perhaps by then
I'll know who “Lady H.” is.
Please sit down.
You 'll have some tea? Well then, if you don't mind,
We'll get to business. That's to say, unless-
I'm not mistaken, am I? You—you ’ve come-
It is about the governess's place ?
I thought at first you looked-then, may I ask,-
Now are you fond of little boys? So glad !
Then you are sure to love my ALGERNON.
He's such a duck-a little difficult,
You know, high-spirited and all the rest,
But such a clever angel. By the way,
Were you at Girton ? Oh! Not anywhere?
Dear me! Of course that makes a difference.
My husband's so particular. But still
It's chiefly moral training Algy wants,
And that, no doubt-
Yes, yes, we 'll come to that:
The-er--the salary, you mean. I'm sure
We shall not quarrel over that. But first
I'd better tell you what the duties are.
They 're quite ridiculously light-in fact
If I could only find the time, I'd love
To do it all myself. I always think
A mother's influence so much the best
For any child-don't you? But, as it is,
I simply cannot manage ALGERNON,
I have so much to do.
If you don't mind,
I'd better finish what I have to say.
Your work would only be to get him up,
And see him dressed, and take him out for walks,
And mend his clothes, and read with him-in fact
Look after him until he 's safe in bed.
And then, no doubt, instead of coming down,
You 'd rather have your supper in your room :
So much more pleasant-yes, for everyone.
And, as for salary, my husband meant

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MR. Batson has garnered a series of papers appearing
from time to time in various magazines, and strung them
together under the title, A Book of the Country and the
Garden (METHUEN). They form a pleasant, chatty, diary of
a year running from March to February. For amateur
gardeners they convey many useful hints. For those who,
like my Baronite, prefer to look on whilst the gardener is at
work, they are full of pleasant memories and associations.
An added interest is found in the fact that the book is
illustrated with a number of pretty sketches by Mr. A. C.
GOULD; his father, the inimitable F. C. G., occasionally
looking in and showing how the thing should be done.
The steps of Lovey Mary (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) leading
footsore little Tommy, land her in the Cabbage Patch, where
we meet again Mrs. Wiggs, Miss Hazy, Asia, Australia, and
Europeny. Lovey Mary, aged thirteen, is monitress in a
Home for Children. Her motherly heart, swelling at the
prospect of losing a little waif and stray she had taken to
it, runs off with him and goes in search of a situation that
will enable her to keep him in comfort. Their progress is
hampered by Tommy's insistence on possessing a live duck,
in place of one whose companionship he had cultured in the
playground of the Home. A dollar was Mary's sole capital,
but she spent what was necessary in the purchase of a duck,
which Tommy conveniently carried with his arm round its
neck. The Cabbage Patch thus invaded rises to its usual
height of neighbourly hospitality. In Miss ALICE HEGAN RICE's
hands it loses nothing of its residential squalor and its innate
freshness of human nature. My Baronite is delighted to
meet Mrs. Wiggs again, with her cheery way of looking out
on the world. Here is a bit of her philosophy worth
writing out in letters of gold and hanging up in other
people's households : “ The way to git cheerful is to smile
when you feel bad, to think about somebody else's headache
when yer own is 'most bustin', to keep on believin' the sun
is a-shinin' when the clouds is thick enough to cut. Nothin'
helps you to like it like thinkin' more 'bout other folks
than about yerself.”
Cornelius (SMITH, ELDER) is the story of the daily lives of
a happy variety of living men and women. It is set alter-
nately in a background of town and country, the latter
affording Mrs. DE LA PASTURE opportunity for fresh display
of the delicacy of her pencil and brush. The germ of the
plot-an obscure country boy, son of a dairy-maid, turning
out to be the heir to a peerage-is sufficiently commonplace.

SARDOU'S MUDDLEDRAMA; OR, DANTE OF OLD DRURY.
WHATEVER Sir HENRY IRVING does, he does well and
thoroughly, and whatever Mr. ARTHUR COLLINS takes in hand
at Drury Lane may be depended upon as being done most
effectively; witness Ben Hur, the last scene in which probably
suggested the excellent stage management of Scene VII.,
The Valley of Asphodels, in this play of Dante. Sir HENRY
does most loyally his very best for two French authors,
SARDOU and MOREAU (whose work has been well translated
by one Englishman, Mr. LAURENCE IRVING), who, most
decidedly, have not succeeded, however much they may
have tried, in doing their very best for Sir Henry.
Let it be at once said that with the production of the
piece, in respect to stage effect, it would be indeed difficult
to find the slightest fault; but that Sir HENRY was at any
time satisfied with this piece, as a fine play offering great
dramatic opportunities, may be legitimate matter for doubt.
The Prologue promises and performs well ; so does the first
scene in the First Act. But after this, goodbye to real drama
until the Fourth Act, and during its absence, and in the
absence of anything resembling a connected, well-developed
plot, we must be contented with wonderfully effective spec-
tacle. “Down, down to Hell, and say I sent thee thither,"
sày SARDOU and MOREAU ; and here, where the spectacle is at
its strongest, as it was with Ulysses in Hades at His Majesty's,
the dramatic action is at its weakest.
· The Fourth Act offers a great chance to a clever actor like
Mr. WILLIAM MOLLISON, who, as Cardinal Colonna, makes
the most of it. But where is Dante in this ? Simply an
impressive figure, as would be Death, or Fate, appearing to

dramatically, the doomed and dying sinner has a long way
the best of it. This, Moreau-ver, is but an approach to
SHAKSPEARE's thrilling scene of the death of Cardinal
Beaufort, à la mode de SARDOU. But for Sir HENRY IRVING's
art, i he part of Dante in this scene, would go for absolutely
nothing. The only relief to the sombre character of the
piece is to be found in the comic Convent episode, where
the unconventional nuns quarrel like the fish-fags in
Madame Angot. This causes the audience some merriment,
but it is unworthy of SARDOU, who seems to have relied
upon imaginary revelations of conventual life as supplied
by certain disreputable works of fiction long since exposed
and condemned.
The unexampled popularity of Sir Henry IRVING carries
the piece, which was on the first night received with the
greatest enthusiasm, and his brief address at the finish
was welcomed, as he himself had been on his entrance,
with the very heartiest applause. Drury Lane was a won-

WALKING NOTES.
It is rumoured that the shop-walkers
of London have resolved on a toe-and-
heel performance over the stockbrokers'
course.

The theatres are now exclusively
given over to “walking gentlemen,"
who have struck for higher salaries.
Plays are now entirely in pedestrian
pantomime; they no longer “run ” for
so many nights; there is no “fat” for
actors, and prompters are starving for
want of work. However, the “ghost
walks" all right.
“ WALKER, London,” will not in
future be allowed as a telegraphic
address, as it is computed that there!
are half-a-million claimants to that
title.
During the last few days there has
been a run on Walker's Dictionary,
many of the purchasers being under
the impression that that useful work
contains the ABC of pedestrianism.
P
U
Automatic pedometers are being put
on the market. They will ring an alarm
if the wearer stops at more than a stipu-
lated number of wayside “pubs.," if
his toe and heel are off the ground to-
gether, if he gets a lift on a motor or
otherwise, and if he fails to reach his
destination within a reasonable time.

was well-advised in not limiting his field of research to
modern statesmen. CANNING, Pitt, BURKE, CHATHAM,
BROUGHAM, PEEL and MACAULAY, each has his place and
his pulpit. The result is an interesting, useful volume, a
school in which politicians of to-day may study with
advantage, and with rich opportunity of effective quotation.
FRANK DANBY's Pigs in Clover (HEINEMANN) is a powerfully-
written novel, with a sprinkling of real personalities and of
doings connected with the Rand that are not essential to
the story. The study of character, and of those persons
who have no character to be studied, is most skilful, though
dealing with the weakest and seamiest side of human
frailty. It would be difficult to select from the dramatis
personæ one single pure and upright character, or indeed
one that makes any pretence of an attempt at being so.
The story of the heroine is so painfully absorbing that the
reader is glad to reach the dénoûment, and quits the book
with a sigh of relief, not wishing to inquire further into the
sequel of the tragedy.

Mrs. Gorringe's Necklace, the new piece at Wyndham's

WYNDHAM has informed the public, is a novice in the art
of playwriting. Why Sir CHARLES gave his author away in
this candidly apologetic manner it is not for us to inquire.
Suffice it that he did so. But this statement of fact is no
palliation of Sir CHARLES's sin of omission in not having
shown so promising a dramatist how to end a piece artisti-
cally. The confidential display of the pistol to the audience
in a sort of pantomimic aside, the unnecessary suicide of
the nervous, cowardly young criminal, the probable happy
marriage in futuro of the elderly Alonzo the Brave with the
very youthful Imogene, such incidents as these ought not
to have been allowed to endanger success at the fall of
the curtain. As it is, the audience go away somewhat

Pensions came in nine days after the
Republic was decreed. The old men,
whom modesty did not preclude from
taking the initiative, proposed to have
five hundred francs a year secured to
them at fifty-five years; seven hun-
dred francs at sixty-five, and eleven
hundred francs at seventy-five. “If
they marry or get out of health,
there is to be a scale of years adapted
to either emergency.” Forget how
these details compare with Don José's
scheme. But the coincidence is interest-

that, the Republic established, as in
the case of the Unionist majority secured
in 1895, nothing more was heard of Old

[" To-day in England it would be difficult
beyond the boundaries of London to find a
dinner in tavern or hotel that is worth eating.
Travellers hesitate to explore the British

We used to ask with injured pride,
Before the reason was suspected,
Why tourists ramble far and wide,
Yet leave our pleasant isle neg-

At last we know the culprit's name;
Provincial cooking is to blame.
Even the patriots who own
To liking plain and homely living,
Must often in our taverns groan,
And eye the menu with misgiving;
Since stomachs long for some relief
When daily dosed with joints of beef;
While pampered foreigners refuse
The Channel trip, afraid to take on
A land whose culinary views
Are limited to eggs and bacon,
And with a thankful heart compare
Their own with our depressing fare.
Still in things evil good is found;

Wien pessimists your soul appal,
And England, in a rude decline,
Threatens to stake her little all
Upon the desperate Zollverein--
O should you ever want to know
If still the pulse of Empire beats,
Come where the countless shekels flow,
Come where the flower of London eats !
What man of nicely-balanced wit
Would deem a nation wholly dead
That night by night consents to sit
And feed at four pound odd a head ---
Not just to titillate the throat,
Not to evolve superfluous fat,
But to invite the world to note
That they can pay as much as that ?
Sons of a simple strenuous race,
Their fancy takes no airy fights,
In all the crowd there's not a brace
Of conscientious sybarites.
To most the menu's terms are Greek ;
Their orders run--" Bring on your best !”
They press a button, so to speak;
A chef, from Paris, does the rest.

The hoarded South—they pass them by ;.
They like the fizzy sort that leaps

Château Larose's ruddy bloom
May melt the cognoscente's lip,
But has it, right across the room,
An air of eighteenpence a sip?
That is the test. Your actual fare
Is but a means towards an end,
Which is to prove you do not care
One paltry fiver what you spend.

For propping up a fallen star?

Such as an Old Age Pension Fund,

We can't be very moribund.
And yet I feel that fiscal Joe,
By making trade a touch less free,

Of restaurant society.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
WIThin the space of 476 pages the Annual Register
(LONGMANS) deals with the history of the memorable year
1902. It is supplemented by 150 pages of smaller type,
comprising a chronicle of events, a retrospect of literature,
science and art for the year, and, that to which we must all
come at last, an obituary. The difficult task is accomplished
in the skilful, lucid manner that characterises earlier
volumes of the new series. The summary of the Parlia-
mentary Session, of which my Baronite has some personal
knowledge, is a masterpiece of the art of leaving things out.
This provides room for the adequate record of salient points
of historical value. Other sections of the work are dealt
with on the same lines and with equal success. Withal the
volume, printed in comfortable type, is bandy, and should
be accessible in all well-appointed bookcases.
Mr. William HEINEMANN is to be congratulated on his
recently published work (of which the Baron has seen the
first and third volumes out of the four announced) entitled
English Literature: An Illustrated Record. By Richard
Garnett, C.B., LL.D., and Edmund Gosse, M.A., LL.D.,
who, as far as the Baron can judge from the specimens above
mentioned, have executed what to them must have been
a labour of love with most painstaking care. They have
worked up their materials most successfully, and have
reproduced them with a fine polish. The Baron has
nothing but praise for the results, both as to letterpress and
pictorial illustration, the “illuminations " being exceedingly
well reproduced. The first volume, peculiarly interesting
and entertaining, is by RICHARD GARNETT ; and the third by
EDMUND Gosse, who, in the Baron's opinion, seems to have
had less “ collar work” than his partner (not that this simile
is to be understood as suggestive of even the slightest
suspicion of “lack-work") as dealing with a more popular
part of the subject. The pair are a good match in double
harness, whose united efforts will gaily carry along with
them a large number of appreciative readers.
King Edward the Seventh and his Court (Fisher UNWIN)
is a pretty comprehensive title. Mr. Escott, in dealing with
it, stietches far beyond its limits, bringing into a volume
of little more than 300 pages, a review of the diplomatic
circle, statesmen, clergy, parliamentarians, clubs, and London
Society generally. Compression of space necessarily makes
such a treatise a little scrappy. But Mr. Escort has the
gift of completing in a few sentences description of complex
character. His range of personal information, like Sam
Weller's acquaintance with London, is extensive and peculiar.
To tell the truth he is so ebullient with personal information,
bubbles forth such a rapid succession of names to which he
tacks on reminiscence or criticism, that my Baronite is some-
times at fault in following the sequence. The work is, in
short, what it purposes to be, a kaleidoscopic view of the
men and women among whom the most popular of Princes
of Wales grew to sovereign estate.
Love and a Cottage, by KEBLE HOWARD (GRANT RICHARDS),
a story of a honeymoon, is full of humour. The idea of the
restraint that the thoroughly happy and truly loving couple
put upon themselves amid all their self-inflicted trials is so
cleverly conveyed as to make the reader expect such an out-
burst at last as will wreck their Arcadian happiness. The
storm, however, that seemed to threaten, passes away.
There are a few refreshing showers, which leave the
country all the sweeter and the prospect bright. Some of
Mr. John HASSALL’s illustrations catch the author's spirit;

prefers to form his own ideals from the author's text, is

COMPETITION RUMOURS.
It is not true that Mr. HERBERT
SPENCER is competing for a scholarship
at Girton.
À propos of Girton, we understand
that the College is to be largely ex-
tended in order to meet the strain
which is expected to be put on its
accommodation when the Times Compe-
tition results are announced.
Dr. RICHARD GARNETT has recently
been driven to purchase a peculiarly
ferocious bull-dog to keep competitors
at bay, owing to the Doctor's reputation
for omniscient erudition and easy good
nature.
Mr. LECKY, Sir ROBERT GIFFEN, and
Mr. Holt SCHOOLING, on the other hand,
have sought safety in flight, and under
assumed names have booked their
passage for the Canary Islands.

PERILLA'S PUP.
For ten weeks old it was certainly a
promising pup. To my thinking it
even promised too much, but PERILLA
said not. She argued that, if a Fox-
terrier and a Dandie Dinmont are the
two nicest dogs to keep, a pup that
promised to be both must be superla-
tively desirable. I let the contention
pass, for PERILLA has never thoroughly
grasped the fancier's point of view, and
at shows can seldom understand why a
dog that sits up has not received a
prize. Besides, the pup was mine, I

THE FLÂNEUR’S COMPLAINT.
St. James's Park is fair to view
When Flora paints her buds anew,
But fairer still when to the Mall
Goes Woman, loveliest flower of all,
And, freely bored, imbibes the air,
Dight in the newest kinds of hair.
But woe is me! for days when I
Was Fashion's chiefest butterfly,
When in the Park I used to crawl,
Holding the nursemaid's heart in thrall,
Or in the tea-shop's chaste recesses
At Beauty's shrine pay soft addresses.
A stove-pipe hat, well poised and sleek,
A fresh cravat for every week,
The waistcoat redolent of Spring,
The nicely-blended trousering-
Such were the simple arts I wielded,
And lo! the female bosom yielded.
But now a sterner task than these
Doth Fashion set her devotees,
For lo! her latest whim entails
A fashionable waist (in males),
And in Society a figure
Is now regarded as de rigueur.
For weeks I've tried to do her will,
Taxing the tailor's utmost skill.
I caught the corset-maker's eye
And, blushing hotly, turned to fly ;
The Turkish bath, the morning run,
For luncheon, soda and a bun,
These too I've tried, but all in vain,
I never shall have a waist again !
Ah, no! a life of generous ease,
And Fortune, all too hard to please,
Observe their favourite succumb
To forty inches round the tum.
And shall a younger, slenderer race
Uproot me from my primal place?
Shall I become a source of mirth
To men of less obtrusive girth ?
Rather I 'll pine in solitude,
Till Fashion shift her wayward mood;
Rather in lonely chambers rust,
An exile from the Upper Crust,
And only venture in the Park
With circumspection, after dark.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SHORT VACATION VISIT.
With a few days to spare at Whitsuntide-just from
Thursday afternoon till Tuesday morning—where shall the
working scribbler seek rest and refreshment--and, we would
add, change, but our experience of a vacation tells us that
there is very little change to be got out of any sum, no
matter what the amount, when there's a question of
thoroughly enjoying a holiday.
Paris ? Paris be it: soit. All preparations made, when a
sudden change in the temperature caused us to shudder at
the idea of walking about a hot and dusty town in the
topper and frock of highly civilised life, and of having to face
the necessity of lugging about that extra impedimentum-a
hat-box. Besides, tout le monde will be leaving Paris for
the seaside : the theatres will be closing, and were they all
open, who would choose stuffy French theatre on a “ lovely
night of June” with August temperature ?
Where then? Is there one place we have not visited for
ever so long? There is. Not for over fifteen years have we
set foot in Brighton. Hardly credible: yet so it is. Fancy
Brighton being a novelty to a Londoner! Delightful. And
to what Hotel ? After taking the advice, at the Garrick Club,
of two eminent King's Counsel thoroughly conversant with
the subject, we decided on selecting, as our lead-quarters,
the Hotel Métropole. The thanks of our travelling party
are due to the aforesaid legal advisers, as, with considerable
experience of all sorts and sizes of hotels here and abroad,
we may safely affirm that this same Brighton Métropole,

THE HAUNTED TRAM.
[A gentleman recently wrote to the Daily Express alleging that several
times mysterious footsteps have been heard on the top of a South
London tram at night, accompanied by the rattle of a conductor's
chain and (probably, though he does not say so) a whispered request
for fares. And no conductor was visible!)
Ghosts of The Towers, The Grange, The Court,
Ghosts of the Castle Keep,
Ghosts of the finnicking, "high-life " sort
Are growing a trifle cheap.
But here is a spook of another stamp,
No thin, theatrical sham,
But a spectre who fears not dirt nor damp:
He rides on a London tram.
By the curious glance of a mortal eye
He is not seen. He's heard.
His steps go a-creeping, creeping by,
He speaks but a single word.
You may hear his feet : you may hear them plain,
For--it's odd in a ghost-they crunch.
You may hear the whirr of his rattling chain,
And the ting of his ringing punch.
The gathering shadows of night fall fast ;
The lamps in the street are lit;
To the roof have the eerie footsteps passed,
Where the outside passengers sit.
To the passenger's side has the spectre paced ;
For a moment he halts, they say,
Then a ring from the punch at the unseen waist,
And the footsteps pass away.

OPERA NOTES.
Saturday night, June 13.-As Gilda, the unfortunate heroine of VERDI'S
Rigoletto, Madame MELBA was at her very best. In that most effective scene
of her exit from the balcony, “Sister Mary Jane's top note” was not in it with
the uppermost, long-sustained, clear-as-a-bell-like note of Mme. MELBA. Signor
Scotri, as the Court Fool “with the hump," was excellent, while Signor Bonci
as Il Duca, The Magnifico for whom everyone makes way in the Palace -omne
ignotum pro Magnifico—was magnificent. Mme. KIRKBY LUNN, with her beauti-
ful rich contralto voice, sang the music of the gay Maddalena as perfectly as
she enacted the part. Full house. Enthusiastic audience. “Waits” too long.
Do away with them,—till Christmas.
Tuesday, June 16.—After the recent deluge of rain, ordinary frequenters of
Ascot regard the first day of that race-meeting askance and — take another
course. They stay in town and, unfatigued, repair to the only Garden that
can be visited with pleasure in such an uncertain state of meteoro-illogical
affairs as prevails at present. Well are they repaid by hearing Madame MELBA
singing (and, ye gods, how she can sing !) her very best, and acting the part,
too, with animation at first, and then with gentle pathos, as Mimi, the grisette
heroine of La Bohême. As Rodolfo, her lover,
“Le petit bonhomme tout petit que ça”
Signor Bonci is admirable. Little Davy GARRICK when possessed by tragic
passion was “ten feet high,” and Signor Bondi as Rodolfo, when expressing
his lasting and deepest love for Mimi, reaches the highest sustained notes
possible to a tenor, and is applauded to the echo. On two occasions Mimi and
Rodolfo, making their exit arm-in-arm, as fond lovers playing at being a
happily married couple, prolong the final notes of their duet until they are
well out of sight. Then, on both occasions, the recall was long and loud. All
shared in the exceptional success to which all had contributed. The excellent
cast remained the same as on Thursday, the 11th, only that M. GILIBERT
reappeared in his old rôle—and with his old rolls, which he brings on for the
Bohemians' poor meal in the last Act-and joins his friends Signor Sootti as
Marcello, and M. JOURNET as Colline, in their life-like reproduction of the
Quartier Latin artists belonging to the early Louis Philippe era. Madame
FRITZI SCHEFF's Musetta “is a frisky chef-d'oeuvre,” says the unspeakable
Mr. Wagstaff, emphasising the “f” so as not to allow the point of humour to
escape the hearer—“Jocose that, n'est-ce pas ?” he adds; but we will have
none of it. As spirited as ever is the scene in front of the Café Momus on
the night of Le Jour de l'An, the merry young choristers being well led by
Perpignol, the tenor toy-seller, capitally played and jigged by Signor MASIERO.

OWING to certain changes in the
character of the English summer, the
M.C.C. proposes to issue an entirely
new code of the Laws of Cricket for
next season. The following extracts are
taken from an advance copy :-
1. The game shall, when possible, be
played by sides consisting of eleven
men each. Should any player be
drowned before the conclusion of the
first day's play, a substitute shall be
allowed for the remainder of the match.
Should, however, vacancies occur from
this cause on the second or third day,
they must not be filled. Should there
be no survivors on either side, the
game shall be declared a draw.
5. Should a batsman strike the ball
in such a way that, owing to its being
in deep water or buried in mud, it can-
not be found, six runs shall be scored.
6. A batsman shall be out
(a) If a ball shall strike his lifebelt
when the latter is in a line
with the wicket. (“Belt before

Some Possible Meditations.
GENEVA, June.—What a miserable
country this is ! A ridiculous republic
of contemptible inn-keepers, who are
only brave in the brandishing of their
bills. I despise it. What is the
pleasure of a slothful existence in this
dismal town, even with a little rifle
shooting at targets occasionally ? No
shooting at mere targets could satisfy a
real hero. Give me Servia, the bulwark
of Christianity and civilisation against
the unspeakable Turk! Give me that
land of heroes, who fear not death—for
other people. I, too, will be courageous.
I will take advantage of the heroism of
my glorious army. I have already bar-
gained for a large increase in the Civil
List. His Imperial and Royal-ah, no,
my dear cousin FRANCIS JOSEPH, as I
must call him now, is too severe. That
was a very unkind telegram of his. How
different to the piety of my dear cousin
NICHOLAS! What a dear good creature
he is! So fond of peace and gentleness.
I am glad I sent GEORGE and his brother
to Saint Petersburg to learn to be
heroes. They must go to Kishineff for
some finishing lessons.
BELGRADE, June.--Very pretty flags
everywhere, and all that sort of thing.
But the group of ruffians on the plat-
form is alarming. Are they brigands
in uniform ? No, they are my Ministers,
publicly blessed, with the rest of the
army, by the Metropolitan. Dear,
dear! Shall I have to shake hands
with them? It seems to give me the
creeps. It is a shame they have no
crown. They might at least have got
the tiara of SAITAPHERNES, which must
be going very cheap now.

The following lines are a verbatim report of the peroration of the speech of Professor Punch, F.R.S., F.R.G.S., F.R.A.S.,
dc., &c., on the achievements of the first half of the current year, delivered last night before a Mass Meeting of
All the Royal Societies :
NYENTLEMEN, let me conclude with a résumé, brief but effective,
U Giving the various wonders performed in the vanishing half-year.
First, to remind you of some of our chief Geographical exploits,
Time and the limited patience you have at disposal allow me
Merely to touch in a word on the walk of the Brokers to Brighton ;
And, only second to this, the Discovery's Polar Excursion ;-
Merely to mention the record achieved by the modern Ulysses,
How he proceeded from Brum past Gib to the markets of Joburg,
How he attained to the welcome reserved for eponymous heroes,
Settled a sort of a war by a sort of a peaceful arrangement,
Bearing a buttonhole orchid in place of an olive for emblem,
And in the fulness of time came back to his country's ovations ;
Also to hint of the voyage of three of my staff of employees,
Dauntless, that leaving my Table's rotundity bare of their presence,
Not with a view of obtaining, for meed, the Society's Medal,
But for the love of Research, penetrated to ultimate Delhi,
Did the Durbar and returned, if possible, wiser than ever.
So from Original Travel I pass to Mechanical Science.
Splendid the strides we have made on the heels of the volatile Frenchman,
Fashioning motors that move with the murderous speed of a cheetah
Mainly through air but recur every now and again to the roadway,
Making the milestones show as contiguous graves in a churchyard,
Each with its several corpse-old women, or children, or puppies,
Joyfully yielding their ghosts in the cause of Mechanical Science.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Great are the things it has done, but we look to the future for greater,
Look with incredible hope to the day when the sons of our grandsons,
Heirs of a wet-bob race that has seen, this summer, a deluge
Only eclipsed in the records compiled by the patriarch Noë,
Haply attain to a service of boats on our bountiful tideway!
Next, you will kindly remember, in turning to Chemical topics,
Something surpassing the merits of anti-rheumatical tabloids,
Finer than patented food for promoting an easy digestion
Or for reducing the strain of obesity-lo! I allude to
Radium, very expensive, the source of perpetual motion ;
Take but a pinch of the same, you will find it, according to experts,
Equal, for luminous ends, to a couple of millions of candles,
Equal, for heat, to a furnace of Heaven knows how many horse-power;
Therefore in unskilled hands, or with people addicted to arson,
Likely, I fancy, to prove an exceedingly dangerous substance.
Finally, let me present you a still more astounding production,
What I would modestly ask to describe as my piece of resistance-
Active, not passive, resistance—the half-year's highest achievement.
Rivalling Radium's self in the ardour and light that its atoms
Boldly emit, it possesses the further advantage of being
Harmless; an unweaned babe might fearlessly handle the object.
As for its cost, no price could well correspond to its virtues,
See, I exhibit a sample, though every intelligent person
Must have surmised already the name of the Thing and its Author ;
And you are right; it is Punch's
