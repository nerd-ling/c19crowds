“By breaking helpless people's jaws !”
"Passive Resistance !” he replied.
“Conscience,” I said, “my soul reveres,
But must, О must its path be dyed
With human blood of auctioneers ?”
“Passive Resistance !” he replied.
I gazed upon the stolid clown,
Then turned away and, as I went,
Still mused on Freedom broadening down
By way of legal precedent.
If this is “passive” work, I thought,
Well may her sanguine friends rejoice
To think what deeds will soon be wrought
When they employ the active voice !

THE PASSIVE LIFE.
[Thoughts on a distant view of a distress-auction under the
Education Act.]
Far from the City's storm and strain,
Where omnibuses never cease,
I wandered down a country lane,
The haunt of pigs and ancient peace.
Fair Nature's face from ear to ear
Was spread in one expansive smile :
I even told my heart that here
Man's self 'could not be very vile.
Anon a roar like fiends in hell
Caused in my mind a nasty jar,
And by me flew with noisome smell
A ninety h.-p. motor-car.
Its flanks were flecked with blood and gall,
Relics, no doubt, of dog or cow,
That made me painfully recall
The juicier points of Snarleyow.
But soon I had a thought revealed
That gave my heated passions pause;
“This grave abuse," I said, “will yield
To better-regulated laws.
“Minorities have heretofore
Submitted with a decent grace;
We boast to be, if nothing more,
At least a law-abiding race."
I thought of England's “old renown,"
And how her life is largely spent
In watching Freedom“ broaden down
From precedent to precedent.”
A purer peace possessed my heart,
My temporary spleen was gone,
When I approached a village mart,
And found an auction going on.
I heard a voice cry “Seven-and-six !”
Then suddenly-it seemed severe-
The air was dark with flying bricks
Intended for the auctioneer.
A dozen constables or so
Fenced him against the maddened throng,
He being in the ratio
Of one to, say, a thousand strong.
Two men I marked, above the rest,
Who swayed the crowd by vocal force ;
One stood upon a linen-chest,
The other on a towel-horse.
Remaining cautiously aloof
I thus addressed a local wight:-
“Kindly explain for my behoof
“This antiquated village rite.
“I am a stranger in the land;
What is the battle all about ? .
And who are yonder twain that stand
On bedroom-furniture and shout?”
“Fightin' agin the Tory curs,
Fightin'," said he, "for conscience' sake;
And them is Christian Ministers
Bravin' the martyr's bloody stake.”
“I never knew the martyr's cause
Achieve complete success,” I cried,
MR. PUNCH'S SPECIAL ARTICLES.
(With acknowledgments to 'the “ Daily Mail.")
No. V.---THE HOME-MADE MOTOR-CAR.
IGNORANCE of the first principles of practical machinery is
probably at the bottom of most of the misery in English
homes to-day. At the present moment we know of at least
twelve families in quite a limited area whose unhappiness is
due to the fact that they do not contain a son or daughter
with sufficient mechanical gift to perform so simple a feat as
the transformation of a perambulator into a motor-car.
Every day babies are growing up and rendering the
perambulator useless : how fitting would it be if the vehicle
could by a few deft touches be rendered valuable as a means
of rapid transit for the older members of the household!
Yet no, such is the low ebb to which mechanical capacity
has fallen in this country that instead of being converted to:
an efficient and rapid instrument of transit the old perambu-
lator is consigned to the yard or the lumber room, and the
father and mother still expend annually large sums on trains,
hansoms, and omnibuses.
Let us look at the matter fairly and squarely. Assuming
that baby's legs are now strong enough to carry him, let us
see what is needed to make the pram. (as it is affectionately
called in the house) into at least the equal of a Serpollet or
Mercédès. The first thing necessary is to decide upon the
enlargements to which the body of the vehicle shall be
subjected. Say four feet. A few minutes with hammer,
nails, and planks should effect this. The rest is simple.
An old apricot tin will make an admirable cylinder, and
there is no adapted carburetter more serviceable than a
Paysandu ox-tongue tin. For a sparking plug a hundred
articles will at once suggest themselves. The ribs of an old
umbrella are invaluable in many departments of motor-car
building, and there are few contingencies that will not be
met by a hair-pin. These things cannot be too carefully
remembered. The brake may require rather more ingenuity,
but here we should recommend a return to the serviceable
yet old-fashioned skid, easily prepared from a worn-out coal-
scoop.
We do not go so far as to say that the motor-car thus
constructed would have had a first-class chance in the Gordon-
Bennett race in Ireland, but we guarantee that on an
ordinary English road it would attract at least as much
attention as a Mors or a Panhard, and probably be far less
likely to get its owner into trouble with the police on
the score of excessive speed.
Hooping the Hoop has followed successfully on Looping
the Loop, and as it is now the chief attraction advertised by
Manager Moss the name of the circus might appropriately
| be changed to the London Hoop-odrome.

· Letters of a Diplomat's Wife (SMITH,
ELDER) is a selection from the corre-
spondence written to her sisters by
Madame WADDINGTON during the official
career of her husband, commencing as
Ambassador Extraordinary representing
France at the Coronation of the Emperor
ALEXANDER, ending with his long, dis-
tinguished career as French Minister
at the Court of St. James's. The writer
is a lady whose bright eyes see every-
thing in a room or street. Gifted with
shrewd common sense, a quiet taste for
humour, she has moreover the faculty of
thoroughly enjoying herself, and the art
of communicating her pleasure to others.
Not the least charming passages in the
book are the little asides in which, for
the edification of her sisters, to whom
the letters are addressed, she describes
her own frocks and the dresses of
others. The cynic will probably marvel
when assured that in a bundle of letters
extending over four hundred pages,
written by one woman to another, there
is not a single spiteful remark-even
about a third woman. The picture of
the Coronation at Moscow, with its
undernote of terror at the possibility of
Nihilistic outrage breaking in on the
ceremony, is told with a graphic
power an accomplished special corre-
spondent might envy. In the larger
portion of the letters, dated from the
French Embassy at Albert Gate, my
Baronite finds a fascinating, for all time
valuable, picture of London Society

But, as the pile of heads before her dwindled,
Within my heart there fickered out the flame
That love bad kindled.

ON THE THINGS WE DO NOT KNOW.
Stoke Pogis.
DEAR SIR, A great essayist, writing
on the Evils of Popular Ignorance, has
this pregnant observation : — “The
tragedy of life is that we do not know
the things we do know so completely
as we do not know the things we do
not know.” How often the lack of
knowledge of some trifling fact warps
our judgment of our fellows! A case
in point occurs to me. A clever writer
lived for many years in a secluded
Berkshire cottage, and resisted all the
entreaties of his friends to come to
town. His publishers urged him to
enter literary society, but he resolutely
refused. As a consequence, he could
exercise no personal influence on critics.
To use phrases I detest—he was neither
log-rolled nor boomed. His friends,
whose names were in all the literary
columns, and whose novels were in
their fiftieth thousand, said, “Poor X.
is mad.” A rash and hasty judgment
-for when X. died there was found in
an upper room of his cottage the
mummified body of his uncle. At some
Y
past period it had become necessary for
X. to slay his relative. He had hidden
the body in his cottage home, and
naturally did not wish to give anyone

Captain Wells has entered upon his

is announced, however, that until a

he will continue to transact a certain

Mr. BODLEY's account of the Coronation of Edward VII.
(METHUEN) suffers under the disadvantage of appearing
not a day but nearly a year after the fair. My Baronite
recognises in this a penalty inevitable in connection with
the character of the book. The King's gracious command
being imposed on the author, it was necessary for him to
bestow upon his task a measure of labour and research
that precluded hasty publication. Whilst giving a graphic
account of the ceremonial and of the congregation in the
Abbey, Mr. BODLEY has contributed to European and
Imperial history a chapter of permanent value. Every page
is luminous with historical knowledge and deep thought,
the chronicler's impressions being conveyed to the reader in
his own charming style.
One of the Baron's Assistants writes recommending The
Garden Colony (DENT), by ROBERT RUSSELL, to all who desire
a succinct account of Natal from the days of VASCO DA GAMA
to the present time. Mr. RUSSELL was formerly Superin-
tendent of Education in Natal, and what he does not know
about its physical conformation and its history is not worth
knowing. To the Englishman the story of our earlier relations
with South Africa must always be rather painful reading.
Our mistakes in that regard have been many and glaring.
Let us hope that we have now entered on a more satisfactory
period when, with greater knowledge of the continent and
its conditions, we may show a more intelligent interest in
its administration.

POSTAL REFORM.
MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN is consider-
ing the reform of various branches of
the postal service. It is rumoured that
the following schemes have been sub-
mitted for his consideration : -
(1) Agricultural Parcel Post.-Owing
to agricultural depression our farmers
cannot afford to hire men to drive their
beasts to market. It is suggested that
the lightly-worked rural postman be
employed for this work. A graduated
scale of charges would be necessary :-
bulls, 2s. 6d., cows, ls., pigs, 38. 6d.,
and goats, 58. Stamps would be pur-
chased and affixed to the beasts by the
senders. Any beast dying in transit,
or licking or otherwise destroying its
stamps, would be charged for at the
ordinary rate of ld. for every four
ounces. In the case of ferocious beasts
a registration fee of 4d., payable in
advance, would be required.
(2) Blacklisters' Post.-Any lady or
gentleman who has spent the evening
in genial society and finds her- (or him-)
self unable to return home may call at
a post office, and on filling up a form
stating name, age, weight, and quantity
of alcoholic refreshment consumed
during the last twelve hours, and
affixing to the said form a sixpenny
stamp, will be conducted home by a
telegraph messenger. All persons
assaulting messengers will be charged
double postage. If the postee should
become incapable of walking, the mes-
senger will be authorised to convey him
home by cab, but in such a case the
ordinary letter fee of 1d. for four ounces
will be charged. It is believed that
this post will not only be a public
convenience, but that the alcoholic

Kindly postpone your fell design
Till I 've sought advice from a friend of mine.”
Off he hurried without delay,
Called on his friend that very day.
“Well," said the friend, “ from what I see,
The case is simple, it seems to me.
At the end of the run his claim will cease;
What I suggest is--withdraw the piece.”
“ Withdraw the piece!” he cried (in tears);
“Why, it's only been running some thirty years.
And the life of a musical comedee
(At least of those produced by me)
Is half a century, if a day.”
“Withdraw," said the friend ; "it's the only way."
So another and fresher piece began,
With another and fresher “ first young man.”
And James retired to private life,
Safe from the sand-bag, gun, and knife,
And lives with his spouse (perhaps you 've met 'em ?)
At Sandringham, Frogmore Crescent, Streatham.
ACTOR JAMES.
(A Ballad.)
(Sir Charles WYNDHAM stated that, as regards a West-End theatre,
once an actor was engaged for a piece, the engagement was for the run
of the piece.
The Judge. It is perfectly clear that the only way to get rid of an
actor if you do not like him is to shoot him.-Extract from Theatrical
Case.]
The deeds of Histrion Pym
(JAMES was his Christian name)
The bard proceeds to hymn.
Draw profit from the same.
JAMES did as well as an actor can
In the arduous rôle of a “first young man,"
His form was graceful, his step was light,
His hair was auburn, his eye was bright,
His voice expressive, his laughter free :
He played in musical comedy,
He persevered with his song and jest,
Year after year without a rest,
Now with a fond or facetious glance,
Or an epigram or a lively dance,
Till he happened to set the town awhirl
With his Captain Smythe in The Chorus Girl.
Years rolled by: he was thirty-one
On the opening night of the piece's run;
Older every year he grew
(As, alas ! we mortals so often do);
Stout and gouty, he lost his charm.
The Manager marked it with much alarm.
“ 'Tis long," quoth he, “since the run began;
We must look for another 'first young man.'
Captain Smythe should be tall and slim,
Tender and slender--well, look at him!
Months have fitted and years have down :
He's two-and-sixty--and eighteen stone!”
“Nay, good Sir,” replied Actor JAMES,
" These be illegal little games.
Engaged at the start of the piece's run,
I must play the part till the piece is done :
That (I quote my lawyer's advice) is
The rule that guides in this pattern of crisis."
Dark as night grew the Manager's brow:
“Foiled !” lie hissed. “You may triumph now,
But mark me, minion, a time will come,
And then--" he departed, looking glum,
Till a great idea through his mind there flames :
“ Happy thought! I'll assassinate JAMES."
He called to him ruffians, black of soul,
Fit to be cast for so dark a rôle :
"Murder me Actor JAMES,” said he,
“And a thumping tip shall vour guerdon be:
Drop me a line when his course is run.”
And the black-souled ruffians muttered, “Done!
“Prompt despatch is our aim and boast :
We'll send him poison by every post :
We'll speedily fill him with well-aimed lead,
And daily with sand-bags ply his head.
And if by chance we should fail with these,
We 'll drive at his ribs with our snickersnees.''
“Coɔd," said the Manager. “Ah, but stay,
There may, perhaps, be another way :
I'm loth except as a last resource
To use (if only by proxy) force.
OPERA NOTES.
Monday, July 20.—“Calvé first and the rest nowhere”--
or rather, to be accurate, M. SEVEILHAC “a good second.”
Such is our summary of M. Missa's new opera in one act
produced on Monday night, within measurable distance of
the end of the season. It is over--"Ite Missa est.”
The libretto of the opera to which M. Missa has composed
the music is by M. MICHEL CARRÉ, who would no doubt
have preferred writing a more important and more
remunerative work, but that difficulty, if existent, has been
overcome, and Carré has been successfully “squared.”
The opera, both as to plot and music, is reminiscent; we
are inclined to welcome it on account of its suggesting
relationship to some not very old but very familiar friends.
Maguelone is not unlike Nedda, and bears some resem-
blance to Carmen, with a mélange of the tragic Santuzza ;
while, in the dramatically tragic situation, Cabride is as the
libertine Scarpia to Maguelone's La Tosca. It seems to
have been an attempt, on the part of the librettist, to give
us in the space of one hour the quintessence of a BERNHARDT-
Calvé mixture. Pity that the librettist had not taken a leaf
out of the immortal Box and Cox and introduced a third
character, who might have been “heard off” with a serenade,
to whom the heroine might have been ultimately united, as
was Penelope Anne to Mr. Knox, thus leaving Box (Cabride)
and Cox (Castelan) to live happily ever afterwards, free to
marry whomsoever each, individually, pleased.
Miss Maguelone takes upon herself the stabbing of Cabride,
and so saves her lover, who is really the assassin, from
immediate arrest. But is Castelan really dead ? Badly
wounded he may be, but, in the absence of medical evidence,
not fatally. Over the married future of Maggie and Cabbie
must hang a heavy cloud. Let librettist and composer with-
draw this opera as it is, and set to work to complete it in
three Acts. More hints will not be here given, unless the
generous donor of them be included in the beneficial re-

A BALLAD OF BUTTONRY.
Clothes and the Man I sing. Reformers, note
This of the Subaltern who owned a Coat.
He was what veterans miscall, for short,
By that objectionable term, a wart: *
The Coat an item of the “sealed ” attire
Wrung from his helpless but reluctant sire;
Also the tails were long; and, for the pride
Thereof, great buttons on the after-side
Illumed the wake : majestic orbs, which bore
The bossy symbol of his future corps.
The youth, ere sailing for a distant land,
Did, in the interval, receive command
To“ undergo” a Course, and there imbibe
Knowledge of pith and moment to his tribe.
Thither he sped, and on the opening day
Rose, and empanoplied in brave array
Of martial-flowing skirt, and with great craft
And pomp of blazoned buttonry abaft,
Won to the mess, and preened his fledgling plumes
Both in the breakfast- and the ante-rooms.
Awhile he moved in rapture, and awhile
Thrilled in the old, inevitable style
To that stern joy which youthful warriors feel
In wearing garments worthy of their zeal ;
Then came the seneschal upon the scenes,
And knocked his infant pride to smithereens.
For out, alack! the Fathers of the mess
Most strictly banned that article of dress,
Being by sad experience led to find
Disaster in the buttonry behind,
Which tore and scratched the leather-cushioned chairs,
And cost a perfect fortune in repairs !
It was a crushing blow. That Subaltern
Discovered that he had a lot to learn ;
Removed his Coat, and, weeping, laid it in
Its long sarcophagus of beaten tin:
Buried it deep, and drew it thence no more ;
Finished his Course, and sought an alien shore.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Episodes of Marge (GRANT RICHARDS) is a remarkable
book. It is no new thing for a novelist to conceive a female
character wholly devoid of moral sense. THACKERAY did it in
the case of Becky Sharp. Where Mr. RIPLEY CROMARSH adds
novelty to the exercise is in the particular direction in which
he illustrates his thesis. His heroine, the daughter of a
drunken wife-beating labourer, is a sprightly, good-natured,
attractive girl, ready at all times to do anything for anybody
--especially to relieve them of any valuable property they
may possess. She is, in short, an instinctive habitual thief,
with leaning towards the pleasing art of burgling. Under-
taking a short railway journey at the outset of a criminal
career, she“ lifts,” as she puts it, a strange gentleman's valise
as naturally as, even with keener pleasure than, she handles
her own reticule. In various disguises she goes a-burgling,
by her skill, address and courage meeting with phenomenal
success. The episodes, though strung together so as to
make a story, stand by themselves. They suggest to my
Baronite a sort of reversal of the adventures of Sherlock
| Holmes. He saw crime from the outside and, with unfailing
success, pursued the criminal. Marge, from the inside, shows
how these things are done. The writer's name is unknown
to fame. This is probably his first work. There is some
crudeness about the effort, and here and there the mind
lingers on the potential beneficence of the editorial blue
pencil. But the situations are strong, novel, skilfully con-
ceived, graphically described.
Most of us know some of the verse that helped to make
the fame of the prose writer of The Luck of Roaring Camp.
We are familiar with “Jim,” with “Dickens in Camp,”
and, of course, with “Truthful James." But BRET HARTE
wrote much more than that, some nearly as good. CHATTO
AND WINDUS issue in companionable volume his Complete
Poetical Il'orks. My Baronite, reading it through, is con-
firmed in the impression that we cannot have too much of
BRET HARTE.
So runs the tale. I have it from the youth
Himself, and I suppose he tells the truth.

That his were too emotional for print.)

MR. PUNCH'S SAFE INVESTMENTS.
DURING the present insecure and fluctuating state of the
money market, when, partly owing to alarming rumours
from America, investors are perplexed as to the safe
disposition of funds, Mr. Punch has pleasure in drawing
public attention to certain excellent projects which, if not
precisely Trustee stock, are the next thing to it :-
THE RUN TRUST ;
OR, THE LONG INNINGS ASSURANCE SOCIETY.
CAPITAL: 20,000,000 Runs.
This enterprising Society has been formed by a number
of eminent centurions for the purpose of providing uncertain
bats with assured scores.

GAUKRODGER,” The Nets, Worcester.
Offices of the Company: Runnymead Chambers, Old Bailey.
Clerk : Mr. All CAINE.
The Run Trust has been established to supply two
distinct varieties of demand. It caters both for the
cricketer who desires to make runs for himself and it caters
also for the cricketer who wishes to be able, with the
minimum of personal exertion, to draw the attention of his
friends to a maximum score against his name in the daily
press.
In order to compass the first of these ends the Directors
of the Run Trust have secured a number of important
cricket grounds on the most advantageous terms, where, by

THE BIG LOAF'S LABOUR LOST.
He laid his ivory pen aside
With the air of a man of easy pride,
And toyed with the ponderous chain of gold
Hid in the waistcoat's ample fold.
The roseate hues of moral health,
That colour, at times, the haunts of wealth
When the heart is light and the conscience clear,
Pervaded the general atmosphere,
And hovered about the haloed Head
Of SKINNER & PROGMORE, Limited.
Do they imagine, when all is said,
That the pains we spend on the People's Bread
Are just for their pleasure-to take and use
And drop and be done with when they choose,
With never a care for the sport they spoil ?
To h--1, I say, with your Sons of Toil!”.
Such were the thoughts (I give their gist)
Of the disillusioned philanthropist ! 0. s.
Starting as messenger, ætat. 9,
At a local store in the grocery line,
Fate had fostered his early hope,
Based on pickle, and crowned with soap;
And now his sovereign hand controls
A couple of hundred score of souls,
At wages that cover their weekly bread
With a bonus for funeral rites when dead.
And at present he calmly awaits the hour
When the People's Party returns to power
With a trifle down on the debit side
For several sinews of war supplied,
In return for which, if they don't forget,
They are bound to make him a Baronet.
And here I should like to give the closing
Words of the speech he was just composing
Against a possible early date :
“Free and enlightened Electorate!
Myself a son, I may say, of the soil,
My heart goes out to the men that toil !
Burdens enough you have to bear,
But your Bread should be free as the light and air !
Shall we be false to the faith of years,
Bought with our fathers' blood and tears?
Shall we surrender our hard-won gain
For the charlatan bribes of a CHAMBERLAIN ?
No! we will baffle his base intrigue,
Under the flag of the Big Loaf League ;
Firm to the mast that flag is glued;
Let us fight beneath for the People's Food!”
He had laid his ivory pen aside
With the air of a man well satisfied ;
And turned to his favourite print to read
His evening portion of fiscal creed,
Happy to feel he was like to find
Nothing to shake what he called his mind,
Or lead him to think that the spheres had stirred
Since COBDEN uttered the final word ;-
He turned, as I said, to his favourite print,
Graceful in tone and green in tint,
And at once emitted an angry snort
(Humour not being his special forte)
As his eye discovered the rather droll
Result of the Barnard Castle Poll.
“ This Labour fellow that heads the list "
(So mused the heated philanthropist)
“ Comes of a class whom men like me,
Promising loaves that are large and free,
Flatter and pamper and stroke and pet,
And here is the kind of thanks we get.
The Led Dog bites a hole in his Leader!
The Fed Babe goes and swallows his Feeder!
Oh, sharper far than a cobra's fang
Is the graceless conduct of such a gang!
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The H. A. C. in South Africa (SMITH, ELDER) is a record
of the services rendered in the war by members of the
Honourable Artillery Company. Its editors, Mr. BASIL
WILLIAMS and Mr. ERSKINE CHILDERS, appropriately dedicate
their work to the King, who is Captain-General and Colonel
of this ancient company of men of war. It was a compara-
tively small band, one hundred and ninety-three all told.
But a bare summary of their adventures shows the accom-
plishment of hard work, valorously performed. Of the less
than two hundred, four were killed in action or died of
wounds; two died in hospital; thirty were wounded or
invalided home; whilst eighteen were mentioned in des-
patches, this last an exceptionally large numerical propor-
tion. Naturally, keenest interest in the book will be felt
by the H. A. Č. and their wide circle of personal friends.
But my Baronite comes here and there upon points of
national interest. In June, 1900, the H. A. C., shivering in
coal trucks on a railway siding, where they had spent the
night after a long day's travel, were ordered to march on
Honingspruit and succour the garrison environed by
DE WET. “For two hours," one of the editors writes,
“while Honingspruit was fighting for bare life, we were
pelted by a rain of conflicting orders, each countermanding
its predecessor, each involving some inherent absurdity
which killed it and called up another.” This sentence,
descriptive of personal experience, accounts for much that
made the hearts of Englishmen bleed during the slow
progress of the war.
In Sunwich Port (GEORGE NEWNES), Mr. JACOBS, departing
from his custom of an afternoon, essays something in the
form of a novel. It is, after all, little out of the way of the
Many Cargoes and Light Freights that made his fame and
fortune. A length of yarn literally holds it together. But
the episodes instinctively stand apart. My Baronite finds
in them all the breeziness and fun that marked the earlier
efforts. Mr. Wilks, the faithful steward, is excellent; and
Captain Nugent's unpremeditated trip in the Conqueror,
lightly conceived, is told with contagious humour.
BARON DE B.-W.
Horace on Passive Resistance.
The practice of buying in the goods of Passive Resisters
and restoring them to their original owners was evidently
anticipated by the bard in the following passage, where, by
a permissible figure of speech, he refers to the “ hammered
rates," meaning the goods hammered for payment of the
rates :-
“Mox reficit rates
Quassas, indocilis pauperiem pati.”
THE relations of a lady who had died, leaving a legacy
to a favourite donkey in order to secure its comfort, recently
came into Court and asked for a decision as to who was to
enjoy the legacy after the donkey's decease. “ The next of
kin,” was the judge's verdict.

“ARE WE DEGENERATING ? "
OFT have we heard it said that Britain's trade
Is moving swiftly on the downward grade ;
That while our statesmen lie supine as logs
Old England's fame is going to the dogs.
We heard it mentioned—not without some heat-
What time Sir MICHAEL put a tax on wheat ;
The thing was pointed out to us as plain
When Mr. RITCHIE took it off again.
Some said Protection caused the dreadful hitch,
And some Free Trade, it didn't matter which.
But now a deadlier rumour fills the air,
And lifts the patriot by his utmost hair;
The wan alarmist starts a new refrain:
“ The Englishman's physique is on the wane."
Oh, can it be that honest beef and beer
No longer form the Briton's staple cheer;
That owing to the recent slump in trade
England must feed on scones and lemonade?
Oh, can our youth be growing more effete
For want of nice nutritious things to eat ?
Have all the patent foods they advertise
Failed to preserve us at our normal size?
Time was when we were famous as a race
For massive strength combined with easy grace ;
When (not so long ago) “ policemen's twelves"
Were articles peculiar to ourselves;
When every Englishman that you might meet
Measured-without his boots-at least six feet;
When he, of all men, threw a finer chest
And waved a larger biceps than the rest ;
He only kept completely cool, and knew
Just how to pull a toughish business through ;
Alone he braved the angry tyrant's frown,
And never failed to knock the villain down ;
And when the savage, with disgusting glee,
Tied him head downwards from a prickly tree,
And placed tarantulas inside his shirt,
He only smiled as if it didn't hurt.
But now, alas! the times are changed, and we
Are not a bit the men we used to be ;
Alarming prospect! What are we to do
To wake Britannia's manlihood anew?
Passive Resistance ? 'tis a thing designed
To train the aim and elevate the mind;
Than which no better exercise is known
Both for the muscles and the moral tone.
Indeed, a dozen things one might suggest,
But where's the Master-mind to do the rest ?
Oh, where is he, that godlike man of power,
To rescue England in her darkest hour?
Where now that Statesman who can touch the spot,
And stay the progress of the deadly rot?
Where is that man? Methought a voice replied-
A spirit voice--" The remedy must bide ;
JOSEPH is just at present occupied !”

THE LEGEND OF THE BROWN BOOTS.
It was on one of summer's early days,
When Nature smiled and all the world seemed fair,
That first of all on you I chanced to gaze
Within a shop, O bright and beauteous pair !
Thought I, “The sky above me is so blue,
The sunbeams gaily dance along the street,
Yet I am clothed in garb of sombre hue,
With boots funereal upon my feet.
“A summer suit just now I can't afford,
But other footgear surely I can don!”
I took some money from my little hoard,
Then walked into the shop and tried you on.
You fitted me—I did not mind the price-
And, wearing you, abroad I yearned to roam ;
I would not listen to the man's advice
To let him wrap you up and send you home.
I paid the bill and waited for the change,
Then left the shop in all my foolish pride;
But Nature seemed to undergo a change
The very moment that I stepped outside.
The sky, as I remarked before, was blue,
The sun was shining brightly overhead,
Yet everything seemed dull and dark of hue,
Except where I so boldly dared to tread.
The passing errand-boys their baskets dropped
In sheer astonishment, as on I strode;
The horses shied—I think the traffic stopped-
As soon as I began to cross the road.
When my front door I opened with my key,
The children all fled shrieking up the stair ;
My wife pulled down the blinds, “Because,” said she,
"I feel a bit bewildered by the glare."
I took you off in haste and Aung you down,
So that your splendour I might well behold;
SHAKSPEARE ILLUSTRATED.'
“THERE IS A KIND OF CONFESSION IN YOUR LOOKS.".
Ilamlet, Act II., Sc. 2.
It was a base deceit to call you brown,
You shimmered with the radiance of gold.
As weary weeks went on I vainly tried
To dim your blazing, unbecoming hue;
Though many quarts of polish I applied,
It seemed to make no difference to you.
Perchance in years to come you might be worn,
When you assume an ordinary tan;
At present you 're not fitted to adorn
The feet of any self-respecting man.

CONSIDERABLE lccal and political feeling has been roused
of late by the display in the office windows of the Daily
Chronicle of the bones of certain early British Fauna alleged
to have been discovered on the premises. As it is suspected
in certain quarters that the aforesaid bones are being
exploited for commercial or political purposes, we feel it only
right to give publicity to the following facts :-
During some alterations recently effected on the premises
of the St. Pall's Gazette, the skeleton of a gigantic Mastodon
has been discovered. As these monsters subsisted entirely
on vegetable food it seems probable that at the period of
1903 B.c. English Agriculture was in a flourishing condition,
which would seem to point to the existence of some form of
Protective Tariff. A lecturer attends on the premises to
explain the significance of the discovery to casual electors
who like to call in passing.
Whilst searching for copy in the basement of the offices
occupied by the Friday Review, the Editor and a party of
friends recently unearthed quite a quantity of primitive
tomahawks, flint axes, and other implements used for savage
warfare in the Stone Age. These interesting remains bore
traces of comparatively recent employment, and were in
perfect order. Their practical use will be illustrated by
competent professors in the next number of the Review,

THE AUTHOR'S PROGRESS.
[With acknowledgments to the recently
published Vera Historia of an anonymous
writer.]
YOUTHFUL ANANIAS, gifted
As few cheesemongers can be,
Eyes of envy often lifted
To the literary tree;
For when in the glass he squinted,
Very palpably it hinted
Genius on his brow was printed,
Genius with a big, big G.
So he longed to leave the Stiltons
And to soar with soully MILTONS —
MILTONS who were such as he.
ANANIAS, all ambition
From the counter up to rise,
Entered for a competition,
Frenzy rolling in his eyes.
O! the pathos of his story!
It created a furore,
For he wrote it con amore,
And of course it won the prize;
E'en the judges had to borrow
Handkerchiefs to dry their sorrow,
Handkerchiefs of extra size.
Scarcely bad the tale been printed,
Twenty minutes-nothing more
When a nimble JAGGERS sprinted
Swift to ANANIAS' door.
In his hand a note. What said it ?
“Story much admired. Just read it.
Would you be prepared to edit
Times to-morrow?" Off he tore,
And that night you might have found
him
With a dozen subs around him,
Subs that by their chieftain swore.

ANANIAS laboured nightly
For a year and toiled away,
Writing leaders grave and sprightly,
Solemn, witty, wise and gay.
Then he thought: “Enough I've wasted
Of my talents; time I basted
To Pieria and tasted
Of the fountains there that play.
I will write an epic one day;
Let me see, I'm free next Sunday:
Sunday is a blessed day.”
On the day of publication
ANANIAS woke to find
He was bailed with acclamation
As a mighty master-mind.
If the publishers could show him
Fame and fortune in a poem,
Fleet Street should no longer know him,
Nor the weary nightly grind.
He would be a man of letters,
Free from all such cramping fetters :
Fetters kill the soul they bind.
In his busy study seated,
Now he toiled the long day through,
Once a week a play completed,
Once a week a novel too.

Others' merits he would measure,
And for recreative pleasure
Scores of books he would review.

Forces which were matched by

(this to her husband) “are you goin' ter stand by an' allow
it? Call yerself a man? Oh, yer contemptuous cur, you !”
The husband, mechanically stroking one of his injured
eyes, seems more embarrassed than ever. One of the
policemen has blown his whistle (the daughter's scorn and
indignation rise to a climax), and meanwhile the pair, very
red in the face, and one without his helmet, are having a
very lively time of it. I notice that the sympathies of the
crowd are with the prisoner, more, as it seems to me, as a
matter of general principle than from any feelings of per-
sonal affection. My bored neighbour of the bare toes has
summoned up quite an interest in life, and even so far
forgets himself in the excitement of the moment as to
condescend to demand of me, “ 'Oo sez old CLAY don't
know 'ow to kick a copper?”
I readily join with him in clearing the prisoner of so
foul a calumny.
It is not long before two more policemen arrive. Even
now it is only with difficulty that the old man is mastered.
I notice, as he recovers his helmet, that one of the police-
men has an eye that should be a proxime accessit to-morrow
to that of the prisoner's son-in-law. The daughter sud-
denly ceases her abuse and becomes pleading.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Mr. GEORGE MORTON commences what my Baronite hopes
will be a prosperous career as an Edinburgh publisher by
the issue of a shilling volume of short stories by JOHN
OXENHAM. The enterprise does not loom large. But it
deserves, and will surely obtain, immediate success.
Amongst the rarest literary gifts is that of writing a good
short story. JOHN OXENHAM possesses it in marked degree.
There is nothing particular in the construction of any of the
plots. They plod along quietly enough. Suddenly, towards
the end, there is introduced an unexpected development that
charms and delights the reader. Perhaps the Episode of
Mr. Joseph Scorer which leads off, will, by its breezy humour,
delight most readers. My Baronite, whilst much enjoying
it, rather fancies Captain Barnacle, wherein will be found
one of those unexpected twists which give the stories distinct
originality.
The Baron has received some post-cards from Messrs.
RAPHAEL TUCK AND Sons, humorously designed and, of
course; capitally drawn in colours by our late artistic
collaborateur, Phil May. These the Baron sees for the first
time, at least he does not remember having already met with
them. This is, however, a detail, as, new or re-issued, they
are excellent, and full of "go,” as they ought to be, consider-
ing how far and wide these post-cards will have to travel.

THE SAD CASE OF THE “SPECTATOR.”
[In the correspondence coluinns of the Spectator, which are almost
entirely devoted to the fiscal controversy, a letter recently appeared
asking for assistance to trace the origin of the saying 'Aplotov jev üdwp.

hero Æneus, a free lance and possibly a Free Trader, who,
after many adventures, landed on the coast of Italy and
founded the city of Rome. It may be freely rendered

PASSIVE RESISTANCE IN SOMALILAND.
(From the “Daily Desert News" of
April 1, 1925.)
At the Police Court, Bohotle, before
Sheikh Anson, Stipendiary Magistrate,
a number of ratepayers were summoned
for non-payment of rates. It was agreed
to take proceedings against Dr. M.
MULLAH, B.D., as a test case.
Colonel WALKER, of the Camel Corps,
Deputy Rate-Collector for the District,
deposed that it was with considerable
difficulty that he found Dr. Mullan at
his temporary residence in the Bobagob
Oasis and presented the rate-paper.
The rate amounted to fourteen rolls of
brass wire and two pounds of beads.
The defendant told witness that whilst
he had no objection to Well Digging,
Camel Burying, or Sand Devil Con-
trolling and Desert Watering Rates, yet
he must object to paying the whole of
the Education Rate, as some part of it
was devoted to the teaching of mono-
gamy, to which he, as a sincere poly-
gamist, had a conscientious objection.
Defendant tendered in part payment
fourteen rolls of brass wire and a pound
and a half of beads, which witness
declined to accept.
Dr. MULLAH's appearance in the dock
was greeted with loud shouts of “Maloos,
kerjug; waugh,” from sympathisers in
Court.
The Magistrate ordered the Court to
be cleared with the bayonet, and asked
the defendant what he had to say.
Dr. MULLAH raised the preliminary
objection that the notification of the

“What brings you fellows down
here?” asked CHARLIE abruptly.
We explained that our arrival was the
purest accident, tempered by a love of
the sea that we had not had time to
dress up to. “It is just the morning
for a sail,” we added, watching the
freshening breeze covering the bay with
little white horses.
CHARLIE said it was, and relapsed into
silence. It was evidently very difficult
to get alongside his boat, but we made
another effort. “We suppose,” we said,

whether it is possible to hire a sailing-

would never hear of our doing such a
thing.
But CHARIJE, quite unmoved, said he
believed boats could be hired at most
seaside places.
“In that case,” we remarked, “We
go seafaring. Frankly, we do not care
for the public maritime conveyance,
hired by the hour, but it appears there
is no alternative.” We paused for a
reply. CHARLIE made none. “We,
too,” we continued, “though you might
not think it to look at us, have the
blood of vikings in our veins. As you
have been so very kind and commu-

REMEMBER, my dear lady, that any

the amateur possesses over the hide-

We are authorised to contradict the
report that the Highbury Safe has been
opened. It has been securely sealed with
stamp-edging-gratuitously supplied by
the Postmaster-General-and the Duke
of DEVONSHIRE always sleeps on it.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN emphatically denies
the rumour that the Safe only contains
a Daily Mail Year Book. “What I have
seen-I have seen," he observed to our
reporter.
Mr. SEDDON wires that the Highbury
Safe is undoubtedly a meat safe.
The PREMIER, in answer to an anxious
correspondent, replies that his mind will
remain open as long as the Safe remains
shut-possibly even a little longer.

MY CRICKET DRAMA.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,--It has long been my intention to submit
for your delectation a few notes of my proposed cricket
drama. Like myself, you must often have thought how
necessary to the literature of the country such a drama was.
England has waited for a man to come forward fit for the
task of penning it. I am that man.
In order not to spoil the enjoyment of the thousands who
will see the play at Drury Lane, I give you merely the
final scene, in extracts. My heroine's father, for reasons
which it would take too long to explain, has promised the
hero her hand on condition that he scores a century in the
forthcoming Test Match. (My hero obtained a place in the
team owing to the fact that most of the other cricketers in
the country refused to play.) Very well, then.

CHARIVARIA.
We hear that, as a result of the War
Commission, there are to be two more
Commissions—one to sit forthwith to
find out what are our actual military
requirements, and another to sit five
years later to find out why the recom-
mendations of the preceding one have
not been carried out.
It is said that there is indignation
even among the Boers at the inefficient
way in which the war was waged against
them.
Among many things proved by the
Commission is the fact that the British
officer is very seldom caught mapping.
A contemporary that does not usually
joke with its readers declares that a
considerable amount of evidence given
before the Commission has been sup-
pressed for fear of making foreign
nations think meanly of Great Britain's
military system.
The Commission has anyhow had the
effect of waking up the War Office. The
report had been published little more
than a week when the following intima-
tion was circulated with a view to dis-
arming criticism : “ The Secretary for
War has directed that Militia frocks of
the old pattern are to be converted to
the new pattern."

Also, the manœuvres of the Third

ducted under actual service conditions.

XXIII. is preparing for the third race,
which is over the triangular course
to-day. Sir THOMAS LIPTON, despite two
defeats, has still implicit confidence in
his boat. He gives it as his opinion
that the Challenger is even a better boat
than Shamrock XVII., which made such
a close fight for the cup twelve years
ago.

XXIII. was re-measured after yester-
day's spin, and supporters of the British
boat will be pleased to learn that, by
taking six inches off the boom and two
feet from the baby jib-topsail, her time-
allowance has been increased by nearly
twenty minutes, making the total one
hour forty-two minutes. This will add
greatly to her chance of winning. Sir
THOMAS LIPTON is reported to have said,
"May the best boat win."
Yesterday Sir THOMAS LIPTON was pre-
sented with another mascot by the
PRESIDENT's daughter. It took the shape
of a handsomely-bound album, contain-

THE SUN-CHILD.
(Continued.)
AFTER this last little adventure the Sun-child walked on
through a deep country lane, on either side of which rose a
thick green hedge set on a grassy bank. It was summer-
time, and the birds were chirping and singing and hopping
from twig to twig, and the butterflies, the modest white ones
and the gay fritillaries, were flitting aimlessly about in
the calm air. At a little distance was heard the tinkle of a
sheep-bell, and every now and then there came the sound of
children's laughter, for it was the middle of the day, and
morning school had ceased. And as the Sun-child walked
he heard voices behind him and soon he saw a little girl on a
pony coming towards him. By her side rode the old coach-
man on a steady grey horse, and the two were talking
together very merrily. The little girl tossed her fair hair as
she spoke, and her blue eyes were bright, and her cheeks
glowed with the beautiful colour that the kind and gentle
pink roses lend to children whom they love :
“MATTHEW,” she said, “ do ou know what I'm going to
do when I'm quite grown up ?”
MATTHEW had heard the question before, and he knew
what he was expected to answer :-
""Lor', Missie, that 'll be a long time first, won't it?”
“Not nearly as long as you think, MATTHEW, for I'm
growing very fast. Now guess."
“You 'll marry a Duke, sure enough.”
“No I shan't. You 're wrong. Guess again.”
“ Wear silks and satins, and live on strawberries and
cream all day long.”
“Yes, I shall do that,p'raps, but that isn't what I mean."

WHEN the Banshee heard that the
ancestral castle was about to be occupied
once more, he felt pleased. He had
been feeling a little hipped of late for
want of society, for he was always a
clubable spirit. There had been a
certain amount of mild fun to be derived
at first from howling suddenly at the
caretaker in dark passages. But even
this had palled after a time, and lately
the caretaker had refused to be fright-
ened, electing instead to be merely
rude. When she had requested him
to “get along with his nonsense, and
stop worriting, do,” the Banshee, who
was the soul of tact, had felt instinc-

was played out.

It is quite certain that when Miss ELLEN THORNEYCROFT
FOWLER sat down to write Place and Power (HUTCHINSON) she
intended to devote her principal effort to the creation and
development of the character of Conrad Clayton. She had
in mind a capable, strenuous, unscrupulous man, who,
neither fearing the Devil nor knowing God, resolved to
make his way to place and power. The moral, not absolutely
new, was that on such terms, success, apparently gained, I
would be built on slight foundation. Happily, Miss
FOWLER's genius, after long effort, dragged her out of this
pit. It forced upon her Mark Stilling fleet and Eileen St.
Just. These really are flesh and blood, whereas Conrad
Clayton, remorselessly fighting his way to the position of
Home Secretary, is a lay figure, an Awful Example made to
order. His unfortunate existence hampers the book. In
spite of the young couple he must needs be preached at and
prophesied against. Miss FOWLER has two voices. In one,
conversation sparkles; in the other, she lapses into a style
of preaching dangerously akin to that of the strolling
“Major” or “Colonel ” of the Salvation Army. To my
Baronite's fancy, the performance is somewhat akin to going
out to dinner and filling in pauses in cheerful conversation
by handing round tracts, or limp copies of The Dairyman's
Daughter. Good work is marred by commendable, though
misplaced, desire to "improve the occasion.” Still, there
remains enough to lift it above the level of the average novel
of the day. Its dramatic secret is original in device and
hidden with great skill. Archie Clayton's proposal to Eileen
is delightfully told.

form, negligently draped in a winding-

of the spare bedroom, his first act was
to utter a piercing shriek. After this
he charged into his room with an
agility that would have been creditable
in a Bounding Brother of the Pyrenees.
“M'dear,” he gasped, addressing his
startled wife, “A ghos'! A shade! A
spectre! Spare bedroom. Fact."
And even as he spoke there was a
slight groan and a blast of icy air, and
the spectre shimmered into the room
and vanished through the opposite

The beds rocked. I remembered that babies are rocked
to sleep, but the storm was not introducing this move-
ment out of kindness to me. Then the frame-work of
the beds seemed to separate; then to shake, as if the beds
would suddenly take to “making” themselves; furniture
cracked, washing-stands rattled, basins and jugs quivered
with excitement, the wind-that is, one of the winds, for
there were a whole lot of them let loose, whirling about
madly everywhere as if they were having a football “ scrum"
with the châlet for football; every single pane of glass
was resisting the attacks of the blustering army with all
its might and main; the bolts stood to their guns, stood
up bravely to the great guns of the tempest, and held
the fort against the desperate assaults of the reckless and
wrecking enemy. Brave Bolts ! their name should be changed
after this! no “bolting" about these iron warriors, although
they were violently assaulted all night and had to stand
the brunt of the enemy's artillery from minute to minute,
with scarce a second's rest, for eight mortal hours, during
which dreadful time it seemed that at every fresh attack
the iron hinges and every stalwart fastening must break,
give way and fly before the enemy. “If the bolts yield

honestly, I didn't. But, grâce à Dieu, the windows resisted
successfully to the very last; yet only at about eight in
the morning was there the slightest sign noticeable of any
diminution in the violence of the assault.
Oh what a night!
No composer or conductor ever made such use of "the

THE SUN-CHILD.
(Continued.)
Now it happened that on a certain morning quite early.
the Sun-child was walking along a street in a large town.
The Sun had already risen, for it was summer-time, but the
blinds were down before most of the windows, and there was
little life stirring in the street itself-only an occasional cart
was rumbling along, making a great clatter all to itself, as
the early morning carts do, and now and again a few working
men hurried along, smoking their pipes, with their bags
slung over their shoulders. Presently, as the Sun-child
walked, he saw in a dark corner something that looked like
a bundle of rags, but, as he came nearer, he was aware that
it was a dog, a black retriever dog, with a coat that may
once have been smooth and beautiful, but was now dusty
and untidy. The dog. was lying down, but he was not
asleep. His mouth was open and his hot dry tongue was
lolling out, and he was panting. And, as the Sun-child
approached, he raised himself and limped pitifully across
the pavement and into the middle of the street, and looked
with startled, anxious, despairing eyes, first in one direction

first-rate hotel, with annexes, stables, plenty of baths, and
a fine lawn-tennis ground, to which the matches attract
residents and visitors for miles around. Neighbouring
friendly Paris-Plage sends troops of friends for tennis; while
for those who do not play games, but who come to be amused,
there are concerts, petits chevaux (not put prominently
forward, but there they are), and, above all, children's
playgrounds where “nos enfants” enjoy themselves (as I
see they do) by the hour, while their bonnes are knitting or
nodding, and the parents and guardians are engaged in
tennis close at hand, or vigorously striding o'er the golf
links just a couple of miles distant.

to decide off-hand as to its excellence as a “Winter resort.”
That remains to be seen.
The forêt offers endless picturesque rambles; the river
Canche, within easy distance, good fishing; and the sands,
for bathing, are just perfect. But as a collection of châlets,
châteaux, that is as a French Birchington or Westgate-on-
Sea, and as regards maisons et maisonettes, Le Touquet as
yet n'existe point. Its châlets are all en l'air; its châteaux
are châteaux d'Espagne. “Mais ça commence," as J. R.
NAP observes, and already conspirators are making their
plots and selecting choice sites with splendid views.
The road from Étaples to Le Touquet Woods is as good as
any you might find in the country—and in France, where
roads are good they are “werry werry good," et au
contraire,—but when the traveller has once passed the hotel
and is well "out of the wood," then, as Le Touquet possesses

Le Touquet is only a name, without a local habitation in it,
save the one already described in the forêt, the roads, such
as they are, have just been left to make themselves, one at
a time, at the expense of anybody happening to require one.
As specimens of fancy work these roads are a credit to the
amateur navvies.
Baron Hamish selects a likely spot in the Wood with a sea
view, and JACK ROBINSON NAP says to me heartily, “Here's
the very place for you to build a châlet. This is the site.

What is a “melo-farce ?” Mr. Melo-farcical Cecil RALEIGH
replies, “My piece entitled The Flood Tide, now being
plavel at Drury Lane, is a specimen of what I understand

it which washes away a house and swamps the plains, just
such an one as, in fact, you may read of in The Master

way, it does not appear that Mr. Raleigh is indebted), would
it not have been more in character with the farcical nature
of the play had he called it The Flood Loosed? Then the
melo-farcical author might have dropped in a quite up-to-

“MR. G."
(By Toby, M.P.)
ONE of the distinctions of Mr. John Morley's Life] of
Gladstone-Mr. G. his colleagues always called him-is the
fewness of the letters given. In ordinary biographies of
public men, letters loom large in proportion to the letterpress.
Mr. MORLEY, seated in the Octagon at Hawarden, a fire-proof
room, a modern adjunct to the building, shrank from grappling
with its contents. Here were stored the letters and papers
of a career rare equally by its length and by the range and
importance of affairs it dealt with. With his own hand,
Mr. GLADSTONE selected 60,000 letters as worth keeping.
Beyond these there were tens of thousands, including copies
of his own, that had not come under revision. There are five
or six hundred in the handwriting of Queen VICTORIA,
bequeathed as an heir-loom by her illustrious but, wherever
royalty was concerned, almost extravagantly humble servitor.
In one of the most charming chapters in a fascinating
book, Mr. MORLEY rapidly turns over the contents of this
colossal letter-bag. It is interesting to find, quoted in full,
a correspondence that passed between GLADSTONE and DISRAELI.
It was characteristic of the former that the occasion which
forced upon him approach to a man he was never able to
respect was first, the illness, later the death, of Mrs. DISRAELI.
Any chord that struck the note of home was irresistible in
its call to Mr. G.
One letter to which Mr. MORLEY makes passing reference
will be interesting reading. The MEMBER FOR SARK well
remembers a scene in the Commons one July night in the
year 1874. The Public Worship Regulation Bill, defended
by Dizzy on the ground that it was devised to "put down

Damages claimed against a Motorist for
Destruction of Poultry.
This was an action brought by the
owner of a Minorca hen of the name of
Dorcas against a motorist who had
caused her death by running over her.
The plaintiff claimed for £1000. The
defendant admitted having killed the
fowl, but pleaded that the claim was
excessive, and had paid three and six-
pence into Court.
Counsel for the plaintiff, in opening
his case, said that his client was the

THERE was a timid knock at the study

It was the house master. He sidled

the very best of all his annuals and, to
many, one of the saddest. It has already,

but still better is the humour of The

"An' ole lady," states the man in the
peak cap.
“The older she is,” says the red-
haired man triumphantly, “the more
shame to you for threatening her.”
I notice that the lady does not seem
fully appreciative of the point that has
been scored by her champion.
"I say I'm a man an' she's a
woman,' maintains the man in the
peak cap vaguely.
“You've said that already,” puts in
his opponent, who seems to be enjoying
himself immensely.
"An' anyone that steals my burrer-
scotch 'll get a bloomin' good 'idin',"' |
concludes the man in the peak cap. I
“Wait a minute, wait a minute,”
cries the red-haired man, “that's not
the point. You said,
"Guard !” suddenly calls the lady,
half rising.
The train has stopped at a station,
and the guard is just passing the
window. He puts in his head.
“Will you please have this man
turned out ?” says the lady, pointing
to her aggressor. “He's intoxicated
and has been using abusive language.”
The rest of the compartment support
the accusation, though I cannot help
observing a certain lack of enthusiasm
on the part of the red-haired man, who
gives the impression of a man quite
irritated about something. The guard
turns to the man in the peak cap.
“Come on — come out of it,” he
says.
The man in the peak cap regards him
with dignity.
"I'cuse this lady stealin' my burrer-
scotch," he observes.
Here the young man in the Panama
hat goes so far as to button up his jacket
and observe, “I'm with you, guard, if
necessary,” which no doubt must be
reassuring to the official. He is a
well-built man with a widely opened
eye.
“Are you coming ?” he demands
shortly.
The man in the peak cap rises and
stumbles out of the door, affording us
as he does so a view of a sticky yellow
mass adhering to the seat of his trousers.
Still with his back to us, he addresses
the guard.
“I'm a man an'an Englishman "
he begins.
The guard has waved his flag and the
train begins to move.
“I'm a man an'a—'Ere, you 'll 'ear
of this !” he shouts, incensed by our
merriment. “I've bin robbed of my
burrerscotch. Where's my rights as
an Englishman ?”
And we are borne on laughing, leaving
him alone on the platform, still uncon-
scious of the fidelity of his unseen
adherent.

RHYMES OF THE EAST.
THE FINEST VIEW.
Away, away! The plains of Ind
Have set their victim free;
I cast my sorrows to the wind,
My sun-hat in the sea ;
And, standing with a chosen few,
I watch a dying glow,
The passing of the Finest View
That all the world can show.
It would not fire an artist's eye,
This View whereof I sing;
Poets, no doubt, would pass it by
As quite a common thing;
Tourists would heave a scornful|
sniff,
And find no beauties there-
They couldn't if they would, and if
They could they wouldn't care.
Only for him that turns the back
On dark and evil days
It throws a glory down his track
That sets his heart ablaze;
A charm to make the wounded whole,
Which wearied eyes may draw
Luxuriously through the soul,
Like cocktails through a straw.
I have seen strong men moved to tears
When gazing o'er the deep,
Hard men,whom I have known foryears,
Nor dreamt that they could weep;
Even myself, though stern and cold
Beyond the common line,
Cannot, for very joy, withhold
The tribute of my brine.
Farewell, farewell, thou best of Views !
I leave thee to thy pain,
And, while I have the power to choose,
We shall not meet again;
But, ʼmid the scenes of joy and mirth,
My fancies oft will turn
Back to the Finest Sight on Earth,
The Bombay Lights-astern!

(Mr. Punch's own Collection.)
The long unpublished narrative poem
by Sir WALTER SCOTT (called, for lack of
a better name, The Lay of the Very
Last Minstrel) from which Mr. Punch
printed an extract two weeks ago, is by
no means the only specimen of this
class of verse which figures in his col-
lection. A poem in the same genre by
BYRON, with the usual Oriental back-
ground, is one of his most prized pos-
sessions. It opens finely thus :
The Night is dark. No moonlight shines
Along the Moslem's battle-lines;
And jewelled mosque and stern serai

know whether he is to resign too, or whether the Empire is
to be allowed to go on a little longer. I may tell you in con-
fidence that if anything happened to Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, the
new butchering business would put up its shutters at once.
Then he went to take exercise. It's quite a mistake to imagine
that Mr. CHAMBERLAIN never takes exercise. He practises air-
gun shooting in the large orchid-house every morning. The
target at present is Mr. ASQUITH. You need not start-it's
only a dummy. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN was shot to pieces long
since. Sometimes Mr. CHAMBERLAIN shoots at a vanishing
target—that of course is Lord ROSEBERY. After exercise Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN chose the Cabinet for the week, and the Aston
Villa team for next Saturday's match. It's really absurd to
say that Mr. LYTTELTON's name was put in the wrong list.
Mr. LYTTELTON is altogether unsuitable for first-class football.

hour with Mr. VINCE at the Tariff League Office, making fresh
statistics. They have to be made every day, for statistics so
soon get threadbare. Two deputations were waiting to see
him when he returned to Highbury. One from the Perry
Bar Publicans, and the other from the Amalgamated Associa-
tion of Bottle Manufacturers. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN in a few fervid
words promised to protect them both. Before dinner Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN went to the stables for his usual chat with Mr.
COLLINGS. Why to the stables ? Because Mr. COLLINGS is
always milking there between six and seven. After dinner
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN dictated to me a new scheme for Old Age
Pensions, his daily letter of instructions for the PREMIER,

jibes at COBDEN (to be inserted in his next speech), and then

A PICTURE AND A PUZZLE.
In the Illustrated Mail for Oct. 17 appears an excellent
reproduction, full-page size, described as “an interesting
snapshot” of a group, aboard the Atlantic transport liner
Minnesota, composed of Sir HENRY IRVING, Mr. BRAM STOKER,
Sir FREDERICK BURNAND, “Editor of Punch,” Mr. CATLING,
editor of Lloyd's Newspaper, and another gentleman mo-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
MESSRS. SMITH, ELDER have commenced to publish a col-
lected edition of Sir Conan Doyle's novels. Of their charm
it is not necessary, indeed possible, to say more than has
been written through twenty years by many pens. Of the
form of the new edition my Baronite finds it up to the
highest standard of the workmanship of the famous house
in Waterloo Place. It will be completed in twelve volumes,
each containing an introductory preface-and two photo-
gravure illustrations. The edition is limited to a thousand
sets, the first volume of each being signed and numbered.
In a preface to the edition the novelist writes, “For better
for worse, I have expended all pains in putting these
books into their final form, and so I leave them. Outside
this edition there is no work of mine up to this date which
I do not willingly suppress.”
In The Long Night (LONGMANS & Co.) Mr. STANLEY WEYMAN,
who ought to illuminate it, does not shine at his best-he
only twinkles and twinkles as doth the little star. There are
some stirring scenes, but interest is fitfully, not continuously
aroused.

LA CHARMING GIRL.
For very nearly a year The Girl from
Kay's has been “running,” that is,
dancing, singing, and acting, at the
Apollo Theatre, in one of the brightest
and most irresponsible of all musical
pieces now being played in London.
The “plot?” Well,-a bride catches
her husband being kissed by the “girl
from Kay's,” and commences the honey-
moon by refusing to be reconciled to
him. In the Third Act they are recon-
ciled. That is all. Besides these two
there is a ridiculous millionaire who|
marries the artful milliner, and a
modern representative of Mr. Toots who
marries the bride's ladies' maid just as
his prototype married Susan Nipper, the
faithful maid in the service of Florence
Dombey. The above“ dramatic motive”
provided by Mr. OWEN HALL suffices as
the pivot upon which all the action,
including dances, turns. As for the
lyrics by “Messrs. Ross, AVELING and
Others" (clever writer of song-words
this Mr. “Others"), they are all well
fitted to lively tunes by Mr. Ivan CARYLL,
whose music, if he has given us nothing
particularly “catchy," is at all events
light, bright and full of “go” from
beginning to end.
As for WILLIE EDOUIN as Max Hoggen-
heimer, he is immense; his eccentrici-
ties are irresistibly comic, his fun never
forced, and the type of character pre-
served throughout. His humour is
spontaneous; in his hands the “busi-
ness ” of the part grows, and as he
comes up scene after scene fresher
than ever, we should be inclined to
doubt whether his companions are ever
quite certain what novelty he may be
going to introduce. Yet is he a
thorough artist, always in the picture,

business” to interfere with what is

NOTORIETY.
Many public men are a failure be-
cause they have no idea how to gain
prominence. It was on our advice
that Mr. PERKS purchased the
Aquarium, that Mr. BRYCE climbed
Ararat, and that Lord GEORGE HAMILTON
resigned. Thus all three gentlemen in
very simple ways were made known to
the public. Mr. BOWLES' white duck
trousers and Mr. ROTHSCHILD's straw
topper were both due to our sug-
gestion. At the present moment a
client has made a great impression on
a Yorkshire constituency which he is to
contest at the next election by (on our
advice) colouring his nose a brilliant
crimson. “Go it, owd Rednose,” is
already a popular cry at his meetings.
The voters can form a distinct mental
image of his personality, and he will
walk in at the next election.
Special Offer for this week only.

we will grant the sole copyright in
their constituency of our famous pla-
card, “ Vote for – and Better Wea-

THERE are who sigh for treasure,
And gold desiderate;
There are whom titles pleasure
And friendship with the great;
On others mad ambition
Enjoins an arduous mission
To win themselves position
And rule in Church and State.
To me such aspirations
But vain and empty seem;
The wealth of all the nations
But so much dross I deem;
No coronet nor mitre
Would make my heart the lighter,
But I would be a writer
In Mr. WELLS' régime.
No longer would I worry
When disinclined to think ;
No more my pen would hurry
Through tales of crime and drink;
No more would I sit toiling
To keep the pot a-boiling
Through half the sleep-time, spoiling
Good paper, pens and ink.
In Spring-time I would wander
About the waking Earth,
And sweetly would I ponder
Its glorious new birth;
I'd roam where fancy beckoned,
Nor would each sordid second
Be marred with having reckoned
How much my thoughts were worth.
Or, stretched upon the heather,
Beside some gurgling fount,
Through all the summer weather
I'd watch the laverocks mount.
Ah, this would please me dearly,
Content with knowing clearly
That sundry hundreds yearly
Were paid to my account.
Then too how very joyous
To feel that others who
At intervals annoy us
Have all been silenced too!
Ah, how the thought engages-
No more eternal pages,
Nor Damsels with their Sages
Awaiting our review!
This land of peace and plenty
Where quiet reigns supreme,
This dolce far niente-
How oft of it I dream!
Alas, that we have here a
Delectable chimara
That waits the distant era
Of Mr. Wells' régime !

without, perhaps, a feeling of excitement in an assumption
partaking, as it were, of a certain softened, diminished
violence, that he had, on this, as on so many and so bene-

of being at all times equipped with this special promise-
unless it were rather a threat-adequately everywhere.
It will of course be understood that Mr. Punch assumes
no responsibility either for Mr. JAMES's opinion, or for
Mr. Kipling's, which comes to hand by the same mail :

A year ago, or almost, through monocled eye war-taught,

Mr. A. B. WALKLEY, treating of the Cabinet divisions, is
allusive without being too obscure :-
It may have been M. GEORGES POLTI, with his Trente-six
Situations Dramatiques, who suggested to Mr. BERNARD
SHAW the idea of The Hero's Assistants. For Mr. Shaw, long
choosing and beginning late, has at last hit upon a new or
thirty-seventh situation. The curtain rises upon Mr. BALFOUR,
described as a Prime Minister, in talk with three members
of his Cabinet, whom Mr. SHAW calls Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, Mr.
RITCHIE, and the DUKE. They are trying to persuade him to
make up his mind about something anything, for choice.
After listening indifferently he accuses them of iteration-
WALTER PATER's "addition of sameness to duty” and goes
away in a motor-čar. His weariness is a genuinely pathetic
thing.
So far there is nothing to "startle or waylay," for the
situation has been familiar from the time of Hamlet to
L'Irresolu of M. GEORGES BERR. The novelty begins in the
next scene, where the three statesmen change in obedience
to IBSEN'S “law of change”-into conspirators. One of
these, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, offers to put forth a plan--"How to
såve the Empire and threepence a week”-and suggests
that each, after resigning--two of them promptly, the DUKE
after “sweet, reluctant, amorous delay”-should try to instil
conviction into Mr. BALFOUR. Each conspirator is to state
his own case as best he may; it is difficult, as M. ANATOLE

Lulled by the murmurous hum of London's traffic

For on this day I kissed my parent earth,

By a huge porter of gigantic girth
At Dover);
Flashed in the train by Shorncliffe's draughty camp;
Gazed on the hurrying landscape's pastoral graces,
Old farms, and happy fields (a trifle damp
In places);
Passed the wild suburbs, indigent and bare
Of natural foliage, but bravely flying
Frank garlandry of last week's underwear
Out drying;
Let none approach me now, for I have dined ;
The fire is bright; Havana's choice aroma
Persuades my senses to a pleasing kind
Of coma;
Calmly I contemplate my future lot:
I reconstruct the past-it fails to strike me
With aught of horror (pity there are not
More like me!)-
My bosom's lord sits lightly on my breast;
The East grows dim; and every hour I stuck to it
Imparts a richer brightness to the West,
Good luck to it! Dun-DUM.

“We report this morning several
contributions made last night by
speakers of eminence towards questions
of the hour, but they were for the most
part of a tame and uninteresting

those colourless addresses which satis-

than to the more decorative perform-

accustomed us, ever since Mr. Punch,

hinted at the possible developments
of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's illustration by

THE SUN-CHILD.
THE Tutor's BREAKFAST.
On a bright day in the early part of November the
Sun-child found himself walking in the Great Court of
Trinity College in the University of Cambridge. The
day was not far advanced—the clock, in fact, was at that
moment striking the quarter past eight-but there was
a good deal of bustle and animation in the old quadrangle.
Undergraduates were walking briskly along the paved
paths; here and there a don was sauntering over the
plots of grass with that air of solemn superiority which
befits one who performs an act denied under pain of a
half-crown fine to the light-hearted tribe of his juniors,
and outside the staircases stood not a few bonnet-wearing
bedmakers, some emptying slops, others merely waiting
for the approach of the cook's porters, who were advancing
in various directions from the kitchens, each balancing
on his head a large blue box containing the breakfasts of
those who dwelt within the Court.
At the foot of one of the staircases close to the chapel
the Sun-child paused. A bedmaker of a comfortable ap-
pearance was rating two breakfast bearers and urging them
up the staircase with their burdens :-
"You ought to 'a bin 'ere five minutes ago," she said.
“Do you think Mr. Holt's got all the day to waste

breakfast and the gentlemen's got to be at nine o'clock

his work which has hitherto never

the agreeable jargon peculiar to what

completed poem was intended to form
part of a volume to be called A Defence

We have been privileged to witness a

grounds against the disappearance of the horse. “Has it ever been

become without its horses, and what a blank would be made if we

Once again the peace and plenty

Take the sugar from a vanished hand once more ?
In your dreams does one caress you,
Does a gentle voice address you,
And a lavish manger bless you
With its store ?
Do you live, poor Rosinante,
In the days ere hay was scanty,
Ere they taught you in your shanty
Sorrow's lore?
Some such visions of the past you dimly see,
It may be,
When the night-time sets your flagging fancies frce;
But I think it would surprise you
Could one possibly advise you
How the gentle artist eyes you-
As for me,

For your pain and degradation,
But I've little admiration,
Poor old gee!
Who can tell me, when you stagger to your bed,
All but dead,
What is passing through your patient poor old head ?
Do you dream of days long over
When you ran a happy rover
In the meadows with the clover
Round you spread ?

The Baron heartily compliments Mr. T. P. O'Connor, first,
on the capital stories in his Christmas Number, and secondly,
on the life-like portrait of himself, drawn by John H. BACON

his lounging dressing-gowny get up (reminding us some-

collecting the materials for this work, which, as one of
reference, is decidedly valuable, and, as literature, possesses a
charm peculiarly its own. It is among the mixed contrarieties
of things that the name of PAINE, which was that of the
architect (1725), should ever be associated with a place that
so contributed to pleasure. Intended originally for a lecture-
hall it gradually developed into a theatre, where, however,
no regular drama could be lawfully enacted until 1812,
when, "with the consent and approbation of the proprietors
of the late Theatre Royal, Drury Lane” (destroyed by fire
on February 24 in that year) “their Majesties Servants"
performed the comedy of The Heir-at-Law. Thenceforward
it was a bonâ fide theatre, still remembered by many as
the temporary home of Vestris, CHARLES MATHEWS, FECHTER,
and KATE TERRY; to be finally and permanently associated
with the bright particular star, Sir HENRY IRVING, for a

dent ROOSEVELT is the kind of man who
would make himself at home anywhere,
whether in the backwoods of the West,
in the stately home the United States
provides its Presidents, or anywhere in
the wide range that lies between these
extremes. Healthy in mind and body,
he is gifted with the cheery nature
whose price is above rubies. His
official position, in respect of personal
power mightier than that of some
crowned monarchs in Europe, brings
him in contact with an endless proces-
sion of interesting people. If he were
cast away in some remote clime-say
on the boundary of Alaska, or midway
across the Isthmus of Panama-he
would still have the companionship of
an innumerable caravan, including
names the most familiar and famous in
the world's history.
These he has come to know in his
library. The PRESIDENT is an omnivorous
reader. At one turn of conversation he
is reminded of a passage in Homer, the
next he is expatiating on the history of
Tittlebat Titmouse. Contemporaneously
with the announcement of the rebellion
in Panama, dexterously exploited by the
PRESIDENT and his Secretary of State,
John Hay, a personality as popular in
London as in Washington, there was
published in the States a new edition of
the works of SAMUEL WARREN. The time
seemed to the PRESIDENT opportune for
renewing his acquaintance with the
works of the author of Ten Thousand
a Year, so whilst the Opposition papers
fulminated denunciation of his Panama
policy he read Tittlebat Titmouse. As
for DICKENS, he knows him so intimately
that he would have been a dangerous
competitor in the contest initiated by
CALVERLEY in his famous examination

IN THE PARK.
CHURCH Parade (writes Little Bird) was unusually well
attended last Sunday. Lord and Lady WORMWOOD were
talking animatedly to Miss ANGELA SCRUBS. Mrs. STEPHEN
Otis brought a large party of Americans who refused to
come off the grass. Baron DE DIETRICH and his fiancée
Mlle. NAPHTHALINE DARRACQ strolled along with Lord and
Lady LANCHESTER. Lady Bath OLIVER, who was well
wrapped up, looked positively younger than her twin
grand-daughters, the Ladies MARIE and ANGELINA MACAROON.
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER looked well in trousers. Lady
UvULA GARGLE's dainty elastic sides recalled the delicious
chaussures of thirty years ago. Miss VINOLIA HUDSON
created quite a sensation by carrying a richly caparisoned
hymn-book, and Mr. and Mrs. SPARKING PLUGGE walked to-
gether until separated by Sir FRANCIS JEUNE. Among a
crowd of others about, I noticed the Hon. BERTIE LARYNX,

and the Rev. R. J. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN, walking with Lady

DOMESTIC DRAMA,

My dear, of course I've come. It is to-day?
Your Sale of Work, I mean? Then that 's all right,
How nice the things all look! Such pretty rooms!
D’you know, I'm quite ashamed I've never been.
I've always longed to come, but somehow--no,
It wasn't that. Oh, no, I've been quite well,
But don't you find yourself that Kensington
Is rather--well, remote? I never liked
To drag the horses out so far, poor things.
But now I've got a motor-yes, of course!
Makes all the difference.
No, thanks, no tea :
I mustn't wait. I've promised to play Bridge.
I wish I could have stayed and helped to sell,
But-oh, to-morrow? Yes. Now let me think.
I'd love to—no, I can't. How tiresome!
I've got to play again-at Wessex House.
D’you know the Duchess? No? Ah, well, poor dear,
She simply lives for Bridge. Oh, everyday!
It's such a pity! Such a waste of time,
And money too! She always plays so high.
But if one knows her-well, it's difficult :
One simply has to sacrifice oneself.
And I'm so weak. I wish I was like you.
You 're so unselfish. But, my dear, you are.
Why, look at all these people here to-day,
Turning your pretty house all upside down.
Ah, well, yes, if they buy! Yes, if they buy!
That's very true. They want some charity
To cover—'well, their hats! Do look at that,
That shocking red one. It's a scarlet sin!
And as for—Goodness! Is it half-past three ?
I must be off directly. What a bore !
I meant to buy such heaps of things. Oh, no!
I've got a minute still. Now, let me see,
I want some Christmas presents.
That looks nice,
That fan. How much is that? Oh, yes. And this?
Is this one cheaper ? 'M yes, that seems a lot.
I'd love to have it, but in these hard times,
You know yourself, my dear, one simply can't.
You mustn't tempt me. Now how much is this?
A guinea ? Yes, that's more the sort of price.
But even that-- I'm having such bad luck;
I haven't held a decent hand for weeks.
No, I don't think I ought to.
Oh, I know !
I've got some nieces down in Devonshire.
I'd like to give them something that would last,
Something to wear-oh, no, not jewellery.
You see they hardly ever see a soul.
Their father's got two hundred and a house,
And seven daughters and an empty church.
No, something really useful 's what I mean,
And inexpensive.
Belts? The very thing!
How much are-oh, I see! No, after all —
They're so unhealthy, aren't they, nowadays-
I think perhaps-oh, stockings? Yes, quite nice.
Now what are-h’m! D’you know, I hardly think
They'd care for those. They always knit their own;
Besides, silk wears so badly. What are these,
These charming handkerchiefs? Two shillings each ?
Exactly what I want. Yes, seven, please.
Poor darlings, how they'll love them!
Well, Goodbye :
MIXED HOCKEY.
You came down the field like a shaft from a bow;
The vision remains with me yet.
I hastened to check you : the sequel you know :
Alas! we unluckily met.
You rushed at the ball, whirled your stick like a flail,
And you hit with the vigour of two:
A knight in his armour had surely turned pale,
If he had played hockey with you.
They gathered me up, and they took me to bed;
They called for a doctor and lint:
With ice in a bag they enveloped my head;
My arm they enclosed in a splint.
My ankles are swelled to a terrible size;
My shins are a wonderful blue;
I have lain here a cripple, unable to rise,
Since the day I played hockey with you.
Yet still, in the cloud hanging o'er me so black,
A silvery lining I spy:
A man who's unhappily laid on his back
Can yet have a solace. May I?
An angel is woman in moments of pain,
Sang Scott: clever poet, he knew :
It may, I perceive, be distinctly a gain
To have fallen at hockey with you.
For if you'll but nurse me (Come quickly, come no:),
If you'll but administer balm,
And press at my bidding my feverish brow
With a cool but affectionate palm ;
If}you'll sit by my side, it is possible, quite,
That I may be induced to review
With a feeling more nearly akin to delight
That day I played hockey with you.

THE USES OF ADVERTISEMENT.
{"Some weeks back we published a state-

The result of that announcement was that the
attention of advertisers was called to the pos-

us."--Daily Mail.]
So great has been the number of
letters from advertisers in the Daily
Mail that the staff of that journal has
been unable to cope with them all.
Mr. Punch at once courteously offered
to assist in dealing with this mass of
correspondence. The following are two
of the most interesting letters :--

Dear Sir,--I must ask you to with-
draw my advertisement for the present.
I have had 900 odd applicants for the
situation of general servant. Besides
being obliged to give forty-three of
them their return fares in order to get
rid of them, I have missed several small
silver ornaments and an umbrella.
Yours faithfully,

of my little boy in your bright little

described as of no occupation and superior edu-
cation, recently pleaded guilty at the County of
London Sessions at Clerkenwell to having stolen
a variety of articles. There was a long list of
previous convictions. “I am a poet of con-
siderable talent,' explained the prisoner. ....

But good education,
And settled convictions too.

As much as he needs to take

But the true poetic mini

Its tastes are expensive,

Of course he must be dressed
In Bond Street's very best ;
But without legal tender
For bills that men render,
What course can you suggest ?
His instincts, I am sure,
Are naturally pure-
He shrinks from committing
An action unfitting
These objects to secure.
But what is he to do
When Fortune's hard to wco,
When prospects, once distant,
Are now non-existent,
And pounds and pence are few ?
Pity the poet! He
Is poor as poor can be.

Shunned by the editors.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A WORD FOR SOME SMALL INVALIDS.
MR. Punch is a beggar to beg, that is, on occasion ; such
occasions must necessarily be rare, as he is compelled to
strictly limit his appeals for assistance. Now one of these “ex-
ceptionāles," as a certain well-known cigar brand is labelled,
is the Hospital for Sick Children, and as on Tuesday, Decem-
ber 22, there is to be a special performance in aid of the
funds of this Hospital, on which occasion the Christmas
fairy tale of Little Hans Andersen, by Captain Basil Hood, is
to be played at the Adelphi, Mr. Punch trusts that all his
readers who have hitherto been so generous towards this
House will assist and give their “mites” towards helping
these other mites, so that there may be added to the “ Lewis
(Carroll Cot," the “Kate Greenaway Cot,” and the “ Punch
('ot,” the “Hans Andersen Cot." This is an appeal from
Hans to Hearts—and Hands in pockets.

“PLEASE, MOTHER SAYS, CAN YOU LET HER 'AVE A 'ARF OUNCE OF THIS 'ERE RADIUM SHE ’AVE READ SO MUCH ABOUT IN THE PAPER ?”
THE BACHELOR'S PROTEST.
LADIES, and all who gaze on me askance,
As one that scorns to deck his barren life
With that cold monument of dead romance-
A wife,
Peace, for you wrong me; now will I disclose
A tale, whose dolorous import gives a claim
To tender pity, not, as you suppose,
To blame.
I have not feared to toe the beetling edge
Of Hymen's indeterminate abyss
Merely from love of self or narrow prej-
udice.
I am not proof to Cupid's wanton dart ;
No armour plates of triple brass confine
This morbidly impressionable heart
Of mine;
Far from it. In the generous days of yore
I must have wooed, and make no empty boast,
As much as any, and a good deal more
Than most.
My past is peopled by a perfect throng
Of maidens-loved with all a young man's glow--
And lost-and more or less forgotten, long
Ago,
With whom it was my dearest wish to live
For better, or—to quote the Rubric's terse
And darkly cynical alternative-
For worse;
And I have urged my periodic suit
Not once, nor twice, since I attained my prime,
Only to get the Order of the Boot
Each time.
For somehow all with one consent began
To make excuse; some did not wish to wed;
Some loved me not; some loved Another Man
Instead;
Some betrayed sorrow, some a pained surprise ;
Two, in a tone no man of spirit brooks,
Had the audacity to criticise
My looks.
And I grew wearied of the harsh rebuff;
Time came, when in my bitterness I spoke,
“I woo no more; it has gone far enough,
This joke!”
So, ladies, I am cabined by a vow;
But soon the Old Year dies, and with the New
Comes jocund Leap Year-it is your turn now
To woo! Dum-DUM.

FIRED by the descriptions in a morn-

little investigation on my own account.
I must premise that I am acquainted

channels I obtained the necessary intro-
duction and password, together with
the clues to her laboratory and sanctum,
which I regret to say I am forbidden to
reveal under pain of instant polarisation.
I therefore took the first bus, and, by
the production of three-pence, hypno-

ticket for the requisite distance. I then
electro-magnetised the driver into stop-

With these words he collapsed in a
heap on the floor, and no efforts of mine
availed to resuscitate him. In' despera-
tion I was about to apply my 10-horse-
power galvaniser, when HOLES stopped
me.
“No bungling, friend Potson,” he
hissed. “I know this man. It is”—
and with a dramatic gesture he un-
covered his (HOLES's) head and sang a
few bars of what was evidently a national
anthem--" It is the unhappy monarch
of Paflagonia !"
I knelt and kissed the fallen King's
hand. “What shall we do with him ?”
I asked.
HOLES's face grew stern. “Throw
him out of the third-floor window," he
said. “It is what he himself would
have wished, for it is the only method
of saving him from his relentless foes.”
I did as HOLES commanded me. At
the subsequent coroner's inquest, which
HOLES very generously attended, the
young man's name was given as SMITH,
and under this name and a plain head-
stone he was buried. The creature who
now sits upon the throne of Paflagonia
is, of course, an impostor, but, for
reasons of state, which I have never, I
admit, been able to fathom, HOLES has
consistently refused to denounce him.
When I urge him to this course he
simply smiles and says, “POTSON, you
must leave these matters to me. In my
own good time I shall do what the
necessity of the case may force upon' me,
but for the present I shall not disturb
the peace of Paflagonia.” And with
that I am forced to be content.

The service was an exceedingly hand-

he would have another try for the Cup.

“ TS the Sun at home?” said Mr. PUNCH, presenting his card.
1 The scene was the illimitable empyrean. Mr. PUNCH had just alighted from his 40-Pegasus-power Charivar-à-banc,
after a rapid transit, and was addressing a smart solar satellite in the brightest of buttons.
“ His Radiance is always at home to you, Mr. PUNCH. Please follow me.”
The Sage carefully adjusted his smoked-glass pince-nez, anointed his face with liquid air to guard against sun-
burn, and was rapidly ushered through the intervening photosphere into the coruscating Presence. The august luminary,
in spite of his advanced years and rotund figure, seemed to be in excellent preservation. His burnished locks were sur-
mounted by a titanium solar topee, and he wore a double-breasted iridium waistcoat, manganese pantaloons, and
carried an aluminium parasol. A sunflower graced his button-hole, and his boots shone with an unearthly sheen.
“Good morning, Mr. PUNCH. And to what do I owe the happiness of this visit?”
“We were all anxious about you,” said the Sage, “and I determined to put an end to our suspense by coming in
person to see if you really still existed. You see, it's a very long time since we saw you. Not a glimpse of you all the
Summer.”
“No fault of mine,” remarked the Great Luminary. “I was shining just the same as usual. If you did not see
me, it must have been because of interposing clouds. You can hardly blame me for them."
“I am at a loss where to place the blame,” said the Sage. “Can you suggest anything?"
“ Have I not heard rumours of a Fiscal controversy? " replied Apollo. "The exhalations of such a conflict might
be very dense and overwhelming.”
“But that did not begin till the Summer was done.”
“True. Yet have you not a War Office that gives off an enveloping vapour ?”
“And you really think," asked Mr. Punch, “that the War Commission and the Fiscal Question have been
responsible for the inclement season ?"
“I will not say that altogether. It is possible that human nature has had something to do with it. Even
Planets have their feelings, you know. Supposing that I had been offended--"
“Offended! I trust not. Surely no one-— ?”

it's no use denying it. It's not as if I hadn't tried things for it. All kinds of things. I sponge my face every
evening in the Milky Way; and I'm getting better. But to hear so much about my spots is very discouraging."
“There shall be no more of it. I pledge my word- if you will pardon the fiscal tag.",
“But that's not all. Didn't I hear Saturn say that the Indian Famine is being attributed to me? And what is
all this indecent Curie-osity about my Little Mary ? Suggestions that I'm nothing but radium ? It's enough to make a
body leave England alone and take to Solar Whist. If I really thought my inside was what your chemists so unfeelingly
suggest, I should give you even less attention than before, because I should spend all my time in the Sunny Gymnasium.”
Mr. Punch interposed with protestations of apology.
“However,” added the Sun, “if I have neglected to visit your country, I have had to pay for it."
“As how, your Radiance?”
“By total ignorance, beyond a fact here and there which I have overheard concerning English progress. I know
nothing of what has been going on. It is, I assure you, a great loss.”
“But that,” said the Sage, feeling in his coat-tail pockets, “can be easily and delightfully remedied.”
“If I only knew how," said the Sun, “I would do anything."
“ Would you shine next summer ? " the Sage replied, with meaning.
“Assuredly,” said the Sun.
“Honour bright?"
“Honour bright-as bright as I alone can make it.”
“Then,” said Mr. PUNCH," the thing is done. Allow me to present you with the completest and most fascinating
record of recent English history.”
“Great Heavens !” exclaimed the Arch-Orb in agitated tones, “ don't say that you mean the--" here he became
speechless with emotion, and gasped out some broken sentences, of which Mr. Punch could only catch "thirty-five
.volumes," "instalment system," "six hundred thousand entries," "full morocco," "fifty-seven pounds."
“Calm yourself, my old friend,” replied Mr. Punch, with a reassuring smile, "the compendium of omniscience
I bring you is of another nature," and, so saying, he laid in the Sun's receptive hands his

Mr. Punch's
Academy of All the Talents.
INTRODUCTION.

JOTHING if not sympathetic and universal, Mr. Punch, when recently bidden by Royal
mandate to form an Academy of his own, decided with his customary sapience that if it
was to avoid the limitations of other institutions of the land it must embrace all the talents.
The highest catholicity should prompt him to extend a welcome of equal warmth to the
athlete and to the author, to the journalist and the statesman. Once this principle was
established, it did not take the shrewd eye of the Sage long to pick out his two score
Immortals. Nor was he long in selecting his President.
“What," he said to himself, “do we want in a President? We want address, eloquence,
presence, tact. We want a man who has time on his hands and no particular responsibilities. We want, in
short, Lord Rosebery.".
All then being in readiness, the first meeting of the Academy of All the Talents was called. The forty (Mr. P. F.
Warner excepted) came to a man, and amid a breathless silence Lord Rosebery delivered the following speech :-
. Lord Rosebery on the Situation.
“ MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN, I need
hardly say that it affords me the liveliest satis-
faction to be present at this sublime ceremony,
the inaugural meeting of that long desiderated
institution, an Academy of All the Talents. I
admit that the process of selection finally adopted
was not that which originally commended itself
to my poor judgment. In my humble opinion,
perfect efficiency in all the members could
alone have been secured by entrusting the
choice to Lord Kitchener. That, alas ! was
impossible, the Hercules of the Himalayas being
already too fully occupied with the Augean
labours incidental to his Indian command to
undertake the task of nominating occupants for
the fauteuils of this august tabernacle. I confess,
however, that it was with something like a stupor
of relief that I heard that Mr. Punch, brushing
aside the flimsy formulas which might have
deterred him, had nobly consented to cope single-
handed with this prodigious task. Of the
manner in which our venerable and heroic dicta-
tor has discharged his duty I need hardly speak.
We are one and all of us entirely satisfied with
his exquisite discernment. [Cheers from Sir
Thomas Lipton.] But, my Lords and Gentle-
men, it is not my intention to indulge in any
gratuitous eulogy of a personage who stands in
no need of any intellectual cosmetics. And yet
how can an Academy justify its existence without
The Chairman.

Punch's Almanack for 1904.
immediate and copious exercise in the art of panegyric? [Mr. T. P. O'Connor, · Hear, hear !') I need
hardly recall to you the practice of the French Academy when each incoming Immortal pronounces an éloge
on his predecessor. We, however, have no predecessors. I have, therefore, in my capacity of President, decided
that the needs of the situation will best be met by a carnival of mutual admiration. The choice of subject
I propose to leave to the arbitrament of the hat-I may add, in parenthesis, that owing to my notorious predilection
for spade-work I have borrowed a shovel-hat from one of my fellow-members at the Athenæum Club—thus not
altogether excluding the possibility of that most interesting form of eulogy in which the laudator and the laudatus are
identical.”
After suitable applause had greeted Lord Rosebery's urbane and primroseate periods, and his auditors had once
more relapsed into a state of silent expectancy, the President again rose and directed that the fatal hat, containing
the names of the Immortal Forty, should be placed before the Prime Minister. Mr. Balfour, with a graceful flourish,
plunged his hand into its depths and drew from it a slip of paper bearing the name, not of statesman or philosopher,
poet or golf player, but of Paul Cinquevalli. Nothing, however, comes amiss to our gifted Premier. Merely
glancing round, not, perhaps, without nervousness, to see whether Mr. Gibson Bowles, Lord Hugh Cecil, or
Mr. E. W. Beckett, had yet become Immortals, and finding that none of these was present, he drew himself nearer
his normal height by untwisting two knots in each leg, and thus began :-
Mr. Balfour on Mr. Paul Cinquevalli.

“ It is a truism of biography that for the proper appraisement of the gifts of one's subject one must oneself possess
cognate talents. Versatile and manysided as our President is, I cannot imagine his rendering full justice to the
talents of Tom Morris or Mr. Robert Maxwell. Nor again, to take another concrete example, could the task of
eulogising Casanova or Benvenuto Cellini be assigned with any reasonable hope
of artistic success to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Clifford, or General
Booth. The balance of criminality in all these hypothetical cases would be
injuriously if not fatally impaired. Hence it is I feel that Chance, in directing
my poor right hand to the paper slip on which the golden name of Signor
Paul Cinquevalli is inscribed—that Chance, I say, in bringing my hand and
this mellifluous if unhappily alien name together, knew her business. Not
that I claim to be for a moment worthy of the high honour of celebrating
such genius as that which our Italian friend possesses, but that I am in a
small measure also in what some of my Radical friends might call, in their
picturesque commercial vernacular, the same line of business. It is one
of the privileges connected with association with my right honourable
friend the late Secretary for the Colonies that sooner or later one acquires
an aptitude in the art of simultaneously upholding propositions of a con-
Alicting character. I was, I believe, always endowed with a certain skill in
the manipulation of words, but never, until the question of Tariff Reform
was sprung upon a heedless country by my right honourable friend, did I
seriously devote my energies to the mastery of this fascinating art. Most
of you have, I trust, at one time or another derived enjoyment from the
spectacle of Signor Cinquevalli when engaged in the congenial task of
juggling with three objects of such widely divergent size and specific
gravity as a champagne bottle, a cannon ball, and a piece of paper.
Without intermission, without a hitch, without a lapse, he keeps them all
going. They are always before you, they are never dropped, they are
constantly but never for long in hand. I too, as a humble imitator of this
great equilibrist, have essayed to translate these methods to the sphere of
high politics and to maintain simultaneously the divergent claims of
preferential tariffs, of food taxation and of retaliation. If for the moment
I have failed to achieve my aim, let not that be taken to indicate any
lack of appreciation for the splendid example furnished me by Signor Joseph
Cinquevalli and Mr. Paul Chamberlain.”

“ Pathologically as well as ethically no more congenial subject could have fallen to my lot than that assigned to me
by the fortune of the draw, which gives me an opportunity of clearing up the painful tragedy which envelopes
the career of my gifted but undersized compatriot, commonly identified by unthinking readers with all that makes for
mirth and ingenuous exuberance.
“MacGreegor's achievement is all the more astounding when his antecedents,
his inherited qualities and his environment are taken into account. As the result
of careful inquiries into his family history I have established beyond a doubt the
painful but engrossing fact that his great-great-grandfather was hung for sheep-
stealing, that his grandfather suffered from chronic neurasthenipposcelosclerosis,
that his mother was a dipsomaniac, and his father a victim to intermittent
elephantiasis. MacGreegor himself, incredible as it may appear, turned the scale
on the day of his birth at no less than fifteen pounds. Yet when he had reached
the age of eight, owing to persistent malnutrition—his diet consisted exclusively
of gin and “taiblet,'—he was still under two stone. Offers were frequently
made to his parents by the proprietors of freak shows, but they decided that the
cultivation of his literary talents was likely to prove a more remunerative invest-
ment. The poor child was a victim to overpressure from his earliest infancy. He
was apprenticed in turn to J. M. Barrie, Ian Maclaren, Neil Munro, S. R. Crockett
and William Archer, and before reaching his ninth birthday was a past-master
of every variety of Caledonian jargon from the lingua franca of Lerwick to the
Romance patois of Galloway.
“He was inoculated in the method of Socratic interrogation by the late Emeritus
Professor Bain, and studied the shortest catechism under Dr. Robertson Nicoll.
Naturally enough these superhuman accomplishments were purchased by a terrible
expenditure of nervous energy. From his fifth year he suffered from peripheral
neuritis complicated with gangloid dislocation of the dorsal mandible. Aphasia,
metaphasia and fluorescent polyphasia were his daily lot. Added to the inherent
drawbacks of a mattoid constitution were the tortures to which he was perpetually
subjected by his parents, who insisted on clothing him in Harris Tweeds of the
most insanitary description, and forced him to learn by heart long extracts from
Froude's History, and recite the most stuntifying passages from Mr. Winston
The Admirable Crichton and his
Churchill's letters to the Times. The inevitable results of this protracted martyrdom
cannot be long delayed. MacGreegor, according to latest observations, is rapidly shrinking. While he is still
wisible to the naked eye, professional etiquette and my natural delicacy combine to restrain me from giving full
details of his microscopic dimensions.
“But when his imminent dissolution takes place, I shall be under no obligation to maintain this galling reticence,

portrait of my beloved but wizened friend, full details of the post-mortem which it will be my pleasure and my
privilege to conduct."

The next name to be called was that of our youngest star, Mr. G. K. Chesterton. Messrs. Hatchard, the
publishers of one of his works, had taken the precaution of distributing through the hall a number of copies of their
monthly prospectuses containing “ The Best Thing by G. K. Chesterton,” and also “ The Best Thing in the Daily
News” (by the same author), and the perusal of these had predisposed the audience to anticipate a stream of
sparklets from this young master of paradox. They were clearly relieved to find that the virile mind was encased in
a body of even more overwhelming robustness. When it was seen that he had drawn the Member for Oldham, the
hope was audibly expressed that he would not fall too heavily on the other young genius. He spoke as follows:

attention from themselves. Deliberately they will build up a bulky pile of reputation in the very eye of day, in order
that the shadow thrown from it by the crude light of public opinion may have the right width, the right length,
for the concealment of their private personality. The more crude, the more concentrated the light, the deeper will
be the shadow that this mass projects. Let a man be sufficiently known for some insistently obtrusive characteristic
and he may enjoy a perpetual incognito. Versatility is the negation of secretiveness. If a figure be played upon
by a circle of centripetal rays it ceases to throw any shade whatever. Thus, had the late Mr. Gladstone been
recognised merely and uniquely for a Radical Statesman, he might have practised unobserved that absorbing pursuit
of forestry which he counted even more sacred than the unity of the Empire. But the very catholicity of his talents
allowed him no hermitage for this avoca-
tion. His addiction to Homeric lore, his
inherent taste for Tory principles, his pre-
dilection for High Church ritual, his
passion for post-cards, his genius for the
culture of jam—all these tendencies drew
upon him so diffused an observation that
he could never lay axe to the most incon-
spicuous oak in the uplands of Hawarden
without being made the object of officious
remark.
“ The theme of my present treatise fur-
nishes an illustration of the same impreg-
nable truth. If Mr. Winston Churchill,
late of the 4th Hussars, had been
content with an atavism, had been content
to reproduce his great ancestor, the founder
of Blenheim Palace, he might now be
reckoned among our only Generals ; might
now, in the shadow thrown by the single
white light of military adulation, be de-
veloping his personality unobserved ; just
as Lord Kitchener, in the single white
light of military adulation, develops un-
observed his personality as a desolating
squire of dames. But the plurality not
only of Mr. Churchill's hereditary ten-
Famil
dencies but of his own underivative virtues
has made privacy impossible. From the
great Duke he inherited his claim to be
a final authority on the conduct of wars.
From his father he inherited the capacity
for being a party in himself. From his father he inherited a political wisdom which even the infallibility of
youth cannot altogether obscure. Of himself he has learned the supreme tact denianded of a lecturer who
lectures on the subject of himself. From the same source he derives a talent for romance, ill-concealed
by the adoption of his own name as a nom de guerre. This plenitude of gifts, by which the attention
of the world is attracted as the lamp is attracted to the moth, would in any case have made the exposure of
his inmost heart a mere question of time. But chance, and the insuperable necessity of recording his own
exploits as a war-correspondent, accelerated the discovery of his ruling passion. It was in reading his appreciation
of the Aasvogel encountered by him in a wood during his withdrawal from Pretoria that the public received
its first hint of the mutual understanding, amounting almost to freemasonry, that exists between Mr. Churchill
and the fowls of the air. Yet it has been left for me to emphasize, here and now, the significance of the
implication thus wrung from him in the excitement of sustained autobiographical narrative; just as, not very
differently, I was the first critic to point out how much there was in common between the music of Robert Browning
and the notes of a canary."

Lord Lansdowne was the next to draw the lot. The noble Marquess, speaking in a voice broken with emotion
and French phrases, and with an accent which was not noticeably English, thus addressed himself to the task of
eulogising his immediate successor at the War Office :

The Marquess of Lansdowne on The Right Hon. St. John Brodrick.
“MeSSIEURS ET MesDAMES,N'ayant point vécu comme Ulysse je préfère mourir comme Achille. Ces mots
résument la situation actuelle du grand homme dont je me propose de vous faire l'éloge. Doué d'une volonté de
fer et d'une amabilité à l'abri de toutes les injures [“Très bien, très bien ') il a—that is, if I may lapse for a moment
into the vulgar tongue, he has spared no effort to make the armed forces of the British Crown as glorious
as his own character and as solidly compacted as the obstinacy with which he has set at naught the opinions of
Field-Marshals and other inferior military experts.
“Hélas ! ce fut presqu'en vain qu'il essaya d'apporter quelque remède aux maux
de son pays. Ayant inventé et mis en marche six corps d'armée plus ou moins que
formidables il se souvint aussitôt de la garniture de boutons qui leur manquait. To
these buttons he bent his great mind, and if to-day the British Army is a well-
buttoned force, capable of affronting the winter winds at a moment's notice and of
reflecting the summer sun from a thousand polished surfaces, it is to St. John
Brodrick, and to St. John Brodrick alone, que revient l'honneur de ces prodiges.
(Vifs applaudissements.] Ah, messieurs et mesdames, quel homme que ce Brodrick !
La froide fermeté qu'il opposa à la fureur de ses ennemis les jeta dans de violents
transports. J'admets que pour être ministre de la guerre il ne suffit pas d'être en-
têté, il ne suffit pas même de faire pousser deux volontaires là où il n'y avait que
trois. Mais réféchissez donc. What I affirm is this: the seal was placed upon his
achievements as Secretary of State for War when he was removed from that post to
be transferred to the India Office, which, indeed, no one but a successful warrior
could direct. Vous vous souvenez sans doute de cette photographie du ministre
de la guerre en khaki. Ah, voilà le vrai corps d'armée, le corps d'armée aux

mettre en déroute l'Europe entière.” [“ Très bien, très bien.']

Mr. T. P. O'Connor then advanced to the hat, and after remarking in a rich
brogue on its excellent N. A. P., he inserted his honest right hand and drew forth a
piece of paper. “Read it, read it,” cried many sage voices. “ Taypaychez-vous !”
remarked Mons. Walkley, sotto voce. “Faith and I will,” the genial Hibernian replied.

Without a moment's hesitation Mr. O'Connor began, as if dictating to a typist, the following eloquent if some-
what severe and logical tribute :-
T. P. on Lipton.
“Oh, those old days! I remember, when as a homeless youth, with nothing to feed and warm me but
insatiable ambition, I slept night after night in Trafalgar Square, I would wake early in the cold grey
of the pitiless London morning and think of the three ideals I had set before myself. Three only—not
enough to occupy the fingers of one hand, let alone the thumb-yet how overmastering, how sublime, I thought
them, ay, and think them still, although years are thick upon me and the cruel cynical world has given me
rude buffets.
“And these ideals, what were they? One was to take my seat in the great and august assembly which meets
night after night under that mighty clock which I could see from my al fresco couch, shining like a heavenly
luminary as it beckoned me to the people's forum. That was one ideal—to be returned to Parliament and lift
up my voice to redress the wrongs of my native country, then writhing under the galley chains of coercion
to be returned to Parliament and, note-book in hand, depict for the noble English press the emotions that Aitted
across the faces of my fellow Members. My second ideal was to possess a paper that should be to Literature
what Madame Tussaud's is to the Louvre. And my third ideal was to be admitted to the intimate circle or
friends in the midst of which that great Irishman, Sir Thomas Lipton, moves and has his being.
“Gentlemen, every one of these ideals has been realised. But proud as I am of my seat in

that I am proudest. I remember Mr. Gladstone rising in that
historic building in Westminster to which I have the honour of
free entry, I remember Mr. Gladstone rising to outline his epoch-
making and soul-stirring Home Rule Bill ; I remember Daniel

Emancipation Bill ; I remember Sheridan's defence of Warren
Hastings, and Cromwell's words of thunder as he exclaimed

most subjects, and felt that he might well have drawn the entire lot, they yet agreed that he had secured a
topic which would prove peculiarly congenial.

“The theme before me is one on which I have repeatedly been invited to enlarge; but my notoriously
incorruptible modesty, and the conviction that there are only two living genii, myself and Arthur Bingham
Walkley, who would understand what I was talking about, have hitherto deterred me from auto-exposure. It
is true that in one of the appendices to my recent drama, Brut and Extrabrut, I presented myself under the
transparent disguise of a Millennium-maker ; but even here I was hampered by the suspicion that my apotheosis
had already been anticipated by a public so indiscriminative in its hero-worship that it has actually classed
Sophocles, me and Shakspeare in a common order of constellation. As with the most detached philosophers,
from Boethius and Bunyan to Byron and Mr. Arthur Balfour, the passion for being misunderstood is apt to
develop into a source of satiety ; eventually they achieve a kind of Pindaristic koros ; so with myself. Disabused
of the charm of confounding my own identity, I descended to practical philanthropics, and for a few seasons I

In courtship there is a phase that resembles the game of Bridge, where the
man who is doing the deal regards his vis-à-vis as a dummy in the transaction. But
it differs in this, that the suitor makes his declaration on the strength of the
cards which he assumes to be in the dummy's hand, rather than on the strength
of what he knows to be in his own. The subsequent revelation of the facts often
entails disillusionment.
Marriage, unless supervised by the state, is, as often as not, a private
legalised contract between a pair of negative imbeciles to produce one or more
positive idiots.
Parental EDUCATION.
A taste for self-reproduction is inherent in the human race; yet the fact

Mr. Henry James next came forward and explained at some length and with as much clearness as was
compatible with his reputation that he had to eulogise Mr. Seddon, the Prime Minister of New Zealand. In order,
however, not to disappoint expectation he would do this in the form of a passage from a novel which might or might
not be published at some future date not yet fixed by his possible publishers. He spoke as follows in a voice from
which every trace of American accent had been carefully removed :-
Mr. Henry James on Mr. Seddon.
“He laughed happily, still advancing, and found himself standing by a table laid for lunch in a garden finely
shaded by trees and redeemed from commonness by a fountain that plashed continually in a pleasant irrelevance.
Why had he come there ? On the impulse of the moment he was about to think of a reason, but, his caution
coming to his aid, he paused irresolutely:
«« After all,' he said, with a quick glance into his sub-liminal self, `nothing really matters and nobody cares.
I don't care myself, now do I ?'
“ Thus reassured he continued standing by the table. Sone-
body would join him soon-of that he felt certain—a brother
possibly, a long lost brother, or at least one who would pretend to
have been lost long ago and would thus convince him against his
better judgment. Had he any money? He looked in his purse.
“ A sovereign will do the trick,' he laughed; "I can get rid
of him for a sovereign, whoever he is, and when he's gone I can
forget him.'
“ Not for Joe.'
“ It was a strange remark, made in a strange voice, and Henry
looked up.
"Oh,' he sighed with a poignant sense of incongruity,
you're what's his name, aren't you? My something or other
from somewhere. A stout man'—he smiled again— yes, stout-

“If I heard any one say that in New Zealand-
"Ah, New Zealand. A long way off, isn't it? And you 've
come from there? Or perhaps I'm there and you haven't come
from anywhere. You've just stopped here, and I've—but it can't
be that. And your name 's Dick, Dick Seddon, and you start shops
and grow mutton—so much a pound, and the fat counts. Oh yes,
it does; it counts a lot.'
“But even as he spoke there came a revulsion in his feelings,

and their hands met. Empire was clasping him—that much he
was sure of—and for the rest he hardly thought it concerned him.
This was the material point where all the rest was haze and printer's ink.

Laying aside his copy of the Poetics he extracted the fatal paper from the tendered chapeau. The name he

but after a brief colloquy with Mr. Andrew Lang, in which the word “ Plum" was distinctly overheard, he sprang
to his feet and in the most charming broken English delivered his discours as here set forth :-

Mons. A. B. Walkley on Mr. P. F. Warner.
“Non omnia possumus omnes. And how should I, giving laborious nights to the British drama and rich days
to the Stagirite, achieve the form of all the Graces? Yet I am aware that the game of cricket numbers good
intellects. The author of Waterloo, that ingenious lever de rideau, have I not seen his name among players for the
M.C.C. (is it ?), while the terminology of the field, a little abrupt and unlovely perhaps,
has its appeal to me by reason of a certain kinship to the terminology of the boards.
Thus, I understand that cricketers, no less than plays, desire to run; that short runs
are objectionable to both. Also that an innings, like a musical comedy, is all the
better for cuts. But I am no cricketer, nor can I now learn. O popoi !
“ Yet we are in harmony, cricketers and I. And since Mr. Warner has not
extolled me, it is I that must extol him. Mahomet would not come to the mountain ;
the mountain, that is to say the Mons. (c'est moi !), must go to Mahomet. As I have
said, I do not play cricket, yet there is a peculiar fitness in the subject of my
eulogy in that we are both members of the honourable corporation of the goosequill.'

Boyle Roche, no man can be in England and the Antipodes at the same time. And
the great post which Plum Warner has been called to fill is fraught with momentous
possibilities. He goes as an Ambassador from the mother to the most cricketal, I
mean critical, of her children. The mood of Australia is suffused with that spirit of
self-assertive exuberance which in the time of Alcibiades people called hubris. I have
the fullest confidence that my gifted confrère Plum—will he allow me to call him

and indispensable pages of Aristotle. But the task demands the endurance of a
pancratiast combined with the poly-
phonic versatility of a Humperdinck-
qualities in a word almost equal to
those demanded of a modern dramatic
critic. In conclusion I have only to
express my keen regret that my divided Mons. Walkley, after pulling out
allegiance to letters and the drama has
prevented me from achieving distinction on the verdi prati of

The hat was now offered to Mr. St. Loe Strachey, the Editor or

phosphorescent dog, are capable of resisting a whole army corps.'
Mr. William Watson, who had been furtively consulting his own book of vers de société, entitled Assassins I Have
Damned, now stepped lightly forward in a pair of Pentelican sandals, and lifted the name of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain
from the revolving hat of the Parcæ. Lightly brushing aside the tears of the combined Muses, in a fine throaty.

Mr. Sidney Lee, who was deep in the pages of Miss Corelli's Sorrows of Bacon when the hat came to him, drew
the name of Mr. Montague Holbein. Somewhat discomfited, he did his best to induce Mr. Swinburne to speak in
his stead, but failing in the enterprise he took a header into his subject, and spoke thus:-

“ Most of us have in our tender years emulated those little wanton boys that swim on bladders, to employ a
quotation from the national poet. [The President here remarked that he must request Mr. Lee to avoid shop.'
• Hear, hear.'] But it has probably been given to few of the present company to achieve the degree of efficiency
which has been acquired by Mr. Holbein. Speaking for myself, I may say that when I made my recent visit
to America I had no hesitation in travelling thither by boat. Yet had I Mr. Holbein's capacity (due, I am informed
by my friend Sir James Crichton-Browne, to an abnormal proportion of red corpuscles in his blood), I should
doubtless have swum, a mode of progression peculiarly appropriate to one who, however humbly, endeavours to
justify his title of Writer to the Cygnet of Avon—even at the risk of being late for my first lecture. The subject
of my principal course, I may be permitted to mention, was Shak—[ Order! Order ').
“Mr. Holbein's ancestor, known to
fame as the painter of Henry the Eighth,
father of Queen Elizabeth, in whose reign

ancestor rejoiced in the name of Hans. Not
so our hero. To be called Hans is a restric-
tion. Why not feet too? I might go further
and say, why not fins ? For certainly this
gentleman has, when in the water, such a
command of all known modes of procedure
as to suggest the possession of these useful,
if not invariably ornamental, adjuncts. But,
as I have said, Mr. Holbein preferred, and
wisely preferred, in the matter of nomencla-
ture to strike out—as a good swimmer should
do—a line of his own. And in adopting the
name of Montague he was guided by a sound
instinct which appeals with special force to
me in my character of a Stratford trustee.
[The President again appealed to Mr. Lee
to keep to the point.) Allow me to explain.
Montague was the name of the traditional
enemy of the Capulets in Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo was a Montague. Concerning

say so, unworthy of record in any self-respecting biographical dictionary, it is distinctly stated that he was
anointed with porpoise-oil. Now the porpoise is commonly known as the sea pig, an animal from which, five
fathoms deep,' mermaids cut their morning rashers—[ Shame! shame!'] It would be otiose for me to pursue this
suggestive train of thought further. I can only say in conclusion that next to the pleasure that I experienced from
being presented with the freedom of St. Albans I must place that which I have derived from the privilege of being
allowed to pass a brief but heartfelt panegyric on my illustrious and buoyant contemporary.”

Mr. J. M. Barrie then advanced to the front of the dais. He had a child's rattle in one hand and in the
other a chain, at the further end of which panted a large St. Bernard dog. With some difficulty he blew a kiss
to the President, who said he hoped “ Barrie was doing to be a dood boy to-day.” Mr. Barrie then spoke :-
Mr. J. M. Barrie on Mr. A. J. Balfour.
“You are to understand that when I first saw him I was not so much struck by any greatness in him as by
his pretty ways and the adorable pucker that would come on his forehead if anyone should make a pretence, for
instance, of snatching a toy from his dimpled hand. Moreover he had a flush and a pout of his lips that no
retired Indian Colonel ever resisted, so attractive were they and so infantile,

“We were on good terms at once, for you
must know that in the pleasantest Club in Lon-
don no introductions are necessary. All you
have to do is to select your child and make at
him, putting your finger in your mouth and
extracting it with a pop, an accomplisiiment
easily acquired and, once learnt, never forgotten.
This I tried on Arty and found him an audience
of unrivalled appreciation, never tiring of the
sport and urging me ever onward to fresh feats
with my fingers, so that after a quarter of an
hour of it I was compelled to desist, having, as
I was careful to explain to him, exhausted my
stock of corked bottles, and not having time to
run round the corner to replenish it. At this
ne feigned anger and made as if he would leave
me, but I was after him in a moment, and was
just in the nick of time to pick him up from
the ground where he had fallen with a dump
that disarranged his Highland dress and shook
the lobby to its foundations.
“I ought to tell you here about 'The Other
Man,' a base fellow who set up against me as a
rival for the Child's affection, I desire to treat
him with perfect fairness, and I admit that he
had one thing about him in which he beat me,
to wit, his eye-glass. But did that warrant

trundling it fiercely over the floor, an orchid in his buttonhole and a bitter flash of anger in his eye? In vain I
-called upon Arty: he was gone in a moment, smiling, as I confess, with undeniable happiness and, in his
childish way, calling on the passers-by to witness how Arty was leading The Other Man (which was true merely
in the sense that, being pushed, he preceded him) and how his dear old Dooky-Dook (his former nurse) had gone
and left him. I was about to set off after them when Babsy-wabsy, which was Arty's adorable word for tum-
-tums, warned me that the hour of luncheon was about to strike."

Mr. H. G. Wells, who was the next to be called on, wore his uniform as adjutant of the aëromobilist battalion or
-the Sandgate Highlanders, and was observed to be munching a stick of Plasmon chocolate. Placing his disengaged
hand in the hat with his wonted decision, he drew out a slip on which appeared the name of the Duke of Devonshire.
Gracefully removing the chocolate from his mouth, and at the same moment stilling an involuntary yawn, Mr. Wells
Jaunched immediately into the following eloquent oration :-
Mr. H. G. Wells on the Duke of Devonshire.
: "I am aware that there is a County of Devonshire—very inadequately mapped by the Ordnance Survey—but,
like Mr. Andrew Lang, I have never heard of its eponymous potentate, for whose existence, however, I am content
to take the Chairman's word. Upon Dukes as Dukes, however, I have theories, and if, as I imagine, I am called in
to assist in the education of the present Duke--what is it, Somersetshire ? Dorsetshire ? no, Devonshire—I shall be
very happy to lay the benefit of my ripe experience at his disposal.
“As an advocate of the New Republicanism I have at times felt tempted to answer in the affirmative the
question, Should the aristocratic class be abolished?' So far as I have been able to determine, there is no
peerage either amongst the Martians or the inhabitants of the Moon, while on this planet the hope of the race
is centred in the development of an efficient and instructed middle-class. The testimony of the best writers
of fiction is unanimous as to the detrimental character of Baronets. [Groans from Sir Thomas Lipton.] Earls
stand condemned by the revolting incongruity of a nomenclature which describes their consorts not as Earlesses
but Countesses. What are we to say, again, to a class which does not know whether to spell its title Marquis
or Marquess ? But the case of Dukes is peculiar. [- Hear, hear' from Mr. Balfour.] I may mention that I had a
cousin in The Sorcerer who was a collateral descendant of the Iron Duke: his name was John Wellington Wells.
This gives me some right to pronounce upon the subject. Moreover, as I have stated in italics in my work

Mankind in the Making, honours and titles are a necessary complement to the Republican idea, and if we are to
retain any of the existing appellations, there is none that has a stronger claim on our consideration than that
of Duke.' Endeared to the shoemaking and knife-polishing industries by the invention of a Wellington ; to
tobacconists by the exploits of a Cavendish; to market gardeners by its strawberry-leaves, the ducal rank is one
which cannot be lightly relegated to the limbo of obsolete and
inefficient institutions.
“But, if we are to retain the order of Dukes, we must
use every effort to bring them into line with the require-
ments of modern science. My views on the education of
children are well known, and I would fain see them carried
out with exceptional rigour in the case of ducal infants.
First and foremost I lay stress on the acquirement of an
articulate and refined pronunciation. The clipping of the
final 'g,' calling window winder,' and other solecisms affected
by the hereditary aristocracy should be ruthlessly dis-
countenanced. Especial care, again, should be exercised
in the choice of nursery rhymes. “Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake,
baker's man,' as I have observed in the treatise already
referred to, seems to be a thoroughly innocuous versicle,
and, if stress could be laid on the relative significance of
the big and little loaf, might prove peculiarly helpful in con-
solidating the principles of a free fooder. Again, a warning
against the deleterious Americanisation of our commercial
system might be conveyed by a judiciously revised version
of • Little Jack Horner sat in a Corner.' Next in import-
ance to pronunciation and recitation in building up the mental
and moral equipment of our ideal Duke, I would place
the handling of toy soldiers, with this proviso, that every
army corps should be provided with a section of cyclist
volunteers. At the age of ten the Duke should himself be
instructed in the use of the bicycle (preferably a Bantam),
the Mauser pistol, and the Bartitsu method of self-defence,
a mode of fighting rendered indispensable by the Anglo-
Japanese alliance. His diet meanwhile should be most care-
“When the Sleeper Wakes."
fully attended to. He must never be allowed to drink at
meals, and should be strictly forbidden bull's-eyes, nougat, shrimps, truffles or pâté-de-foie-gras. Above all things he-
should be kept from indulgence in narcotics.
“We come now to school. It is difficult to know what to say about school except that Harrow is bad, Eton
worse. Instruction by gramophone is perhaps best. For reading there is the Fortnightly Review and such a story
as my own Wonderful Visits of Elizabeth. Cricket is not to be encouraged-[cries of “Shame' from Mr. Barrie)
but experiments in practical chemistry or ensilage are useful.
“I see no harm in the Grand Tour, provided that it is for the most part accomplished in a flying machine.
“ The time now approaches for the real business of life.
“What, then, does our Duke know? He knows how to drive an aëropile, and when danger is imminent, thanks
to me and my many works, how to become an invisible man. He understands the mechanism of the gramophone, the
pianola, and possibly the turbine. He can write shorthand at the rate of 150 words a minute, he can conduct
commercial correspondence in German, Spanish and Russian, and he is thoroughly au fait in all the processes
which deal with the by-products of coal-tar. Thus equipped, it is time that he chose a profession; and for my part
I can think of none better fitted to his rank or his attainments than that of a scientific romance-writer.
“Ought he, then, to write under his own name or adopt a pseudonym ? I have no hesitation in recommending
the former alternative. For one thing, he will be the first Duke to embrace this calling, and his achievements will
have all the freshness that attaches to the spade-work of a pioneer. On the fortunate collocation of a title and an
author's name the success of a book has often ere now depended. This is a point on which I am able to speak with
a peculiarly intimate personal feeling, since I am all too well aware that the popularity of my romance, When the
Sleeper Wakes, would have been undoubtedly trebled had I been able to add, · By the Duke of Devonshire.'”

At this point the Chairman wound a small horn and cried, “What ho, within ! Sir Maurice !” Executing,
with consummate facility, the opening steps of an Angevin galliard to the air of The Boys of the Old Crusade,

Mr. Hewlett advanced to the hat and drew the speaking name of Perks. A certain suspicion of collusion fell upon
him as he extracted half a quair of type-written foolscap from his surcoat-pocket, and delivered, from behind it,
the following flowers of English undefiled :-
Mr. Maurice Hewlett on Mr. Perks.
" Pardie! but there has been mole work afoot,' cried Sir Perques, the same that was known as Robert
Hob-and-Nob, for that none could well say how else he came by his hail-fellowship with the Knighthood.
* And, so my boring methods serve, there shall be breaches agape
in the bastions of Heathenry ere the moon has done hollowing her
sickle!' And his eye shone shiftily in a face pale with the vigils of
Les Deux Mondes, this and the next. And under it a tabard stuck full
of phylacteries and splashed with the sign of Aquarius on a ground
of broadcloth ; and thereto a running scroll—Deus et perquisita mea.
“But my lord of Durdans, that had Sir Perques for Squire unbidden,
lay a-bed. And over his pavilion blew a burgee that showed a hand-
plough upon a field of efficiency demi-wavy. And, save on fine afternoons,
when he had a fancy to caracole at large in the manner of the haute école,
rode he not forth. But at such times, he being within bolt-shot of the
walls, and the arbalists of the watch drawing upon him,' he would up
with his hands and Odds Ladas! A truce, Messires,' he would cry;
would ye do damage to a chivaler and a sportsman that makes challenge
for mere joy?' and so shamed them by sheer weight of pleasantry.
“But Sir Perques, that was of a tough stock, and had no lore of
venery, brooked not these courtesies of the chase. And “Sire!' he
cried to deaf ears, our leaguer is wrought of laggard stuff, with none to
head the assault. By my halitube, but I will myself descend into the
heart of earth, and none shall say of me that I would not bore with what
strength I had. And let me but blow these blasted ramparts in air, and
soothly there will be leaders enow to conduct a dead cert.' And so
disappeared into the underground and was no more heard of.
“But none the less my lord of Durdans continued to lie a-bed very
comfortably, or else ride forth, to the admiration of either camp, in a
privy capacity, just as it occurred to his dear heart."

Before the murmurs of applause which greeted the last effusion had
died away Lord Rosebery again rose, and, commanding silence by an
impressive gesture, thus addressed the company :-
“Gentlemen, or shall I not rather say Fellow Immortals! It is with sex
mingled feelings, in which pride is perhaps the predominant partner, that
Mr. Hewlett obliges with a mediæval turn.
I rise to call a halt in this witch dance of genius over which I have been
supremely privileged to preside in the ornamental rather than onerous rôle of master of the ceremonies. My only
regret has been that selection was necessary, and that it has not been possible for every one of us to indulge in these
exhilarating exercises of eulogism. Yet enough has been done to vindicate triumphantly the prescience of the
august pontiff who has called this body into existence, and nobly filled a hiatus hitherto painfully conspicuous in
the Republic of Letters and of Learning. I have only one request to make of you-that you should join with
me in your most sonorous tones in acclaiming our founder and eponymous hero, Mr. Punch !"
A salvo of prolonged and poignant cheers was the immediate response to Lord Rosebery's eloquent appeal.
At last the Members of Mr. Punch's Academy, exhausted by transports of mutual admiration, retired gracefully
in order of merit from the apartment, and the inaugural ceremony was at an end.

RIP VAN WINKLE
AT WESTMINSTER
Reading on, Jesse's head drooped on
his breast. The munching of the cow
by his side grew more dreamy. Pre-
sently he slept.
On waking in the morning Jesse felt
uncommonly hungry, but to his sur-
prise was not at all cold. The weather
seemed to have altogether changed. It
was, in truth, or seemed to be, full
summer-time. The trees were in leaf,
the grass was lush. Grass reminded
him of the cow, and with that memory
came sweet thought of a brimming cup
of milk. Looking round he, with a
start, found the field, save for himself,
tenantless. Here were the three acres,
but where was the cow ? Close by him
he observed, half hidden in the tall
grass, a skeleton. That it had been a
horned animal was all that was certain
in its decay. There was also something
that might have been a tail. But it
had nothing of that kind, not a single
hair, to unfold.
“Strange,” said Jesse to himself,
“I never noticed that before. Must
get Ned, the gardener, to dig in the
bones, and he may as well go and look
for the cow. I'll go home and get
