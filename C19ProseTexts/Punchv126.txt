2 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. . .
[JANUARY 6, 1904.
THE DARLING OF MOST OF THE GODS.
WHEN an audience for half the night has sat enthralled by
such a spectacle as this latest triumph of Mr. TREE's enchant-
ments, it is thankless and even idle work for critics to temper
their praise with reflections upon the dramatic merit of the
lay which happens to have been going on in the foreground.
ne comes on these occasions to delight and educate
the eye, and not to be made to think. And in any case the
question is one of artistic balance and proportion. In a
play of human character one does not want to be overmuch
diverted by the scenic background; and in a play whose
chief motive is spectacular the human interest should not
make too importunate an appeal. It suffices if this interest
serves to engage, without absorbing, the mental sympathies,
leaving the senses free to play at large. Besides, there are
limits to the receptive capacities of even a British audience.
The Darling of the Gods is an ordinary melodrama, whose
claim upon our gratitude lies in its unassertive contribution
to the picture. To say, as one critic has said, that it would
have failed if it had been played in modern European cos-
tume, is to compliment rather than disparage its qualities.
Whether from accident or design, the value of its moving
figures was justifiably plastic rather than dramatic. The
stately reserve of Mr. BASIL GILL's attitudes as Kara of the
Samurai most notably illustrated this characteristic. Only
rarely did the drama dominate its outward adorning, as in
the scene outside the Shoji of Yosan—by far the best scene
in the play, and recalling, by the vivid directness of its action,
that curiously Hellenic tragedy, The Cat and the Cherub:
or as in the episodes of the Carp-fisher (Mr. HAVILAND) and
of ithe outcast Geisha, whose impersonation by Miss MAUD
HILDYARD had in it just a touch of SADI YAKKo's art. . But
these were minor characters. The protagonists F.
throughout with quiet restraint and a fine disregard of their
own personal identities, like priests in a temple, properly
awed and overshadowed by their environment.
I have seen it written that the play suffered from the
failure of the spectator to recognise his favourites from the
start; that “he had not, as it were, the Miss LENA ASH-
weLL that he knew to help him to get on to the track of
the story.” Yet surely that was one of the most engaging
features of the play. It so chances that there is no one who
has recently been more embarrassed in her playing by what
was expected of her as a matter of almost religious tradition
than this same charming actress. I ventured to hint as
much in reviewing Mr. Jones's Monte Carlo play. And here
she was, fresh from a convent school, delightfully innocent
and Japanese, and for the first time for many years absolutely
without a past. It is true that, before the drama proper was
over, by steady attention to her business she had acquired
one,—a sort of multopostfuturum past, covering a matter of
some thousand years in “the hells” (the longest stage-
interval at which I remember to have ever j". by
how unfamiliar a process! Not by the usual breach of
female virtue, but by a really quite excusable flaw in that
sense of honour which is popularly regarded as the exclusive
birthright of the ruder sex. Already, in an earlier scene,
she had trembled on the brink of a blasphemous falsehood,
and had only saved herself by recourse to casuistry; and,
even so, had betrayed her womanly contempt for the minor
moralities by the ingenuous admission that “it is better to
lie a little than to be unhappy much.”
As to her punishment, I never came upon a worse case of
the miscarriage of poetic justice. Her lover, who owed the
temporary preservation of his head to her betrayal (in
exchange for his release) of the hiding-place of his comrades,
himself threatens her with the sentence of death which, but
for her intervention, he would not have been in a position to
deliver at all. How different from the ideal conditions in
Mr. GILBERT's Mikado, where the punishment was arranged
to fit the crime. -
I must hope that Occidental influences have since 1877
fººd the disabilities of women in the neighbourhood of
OSan. "
For these scenes of “Old Japan,” in which a little red
book about love (produced in London) is the only hint of
the coming of European ideas, are laid in a period scarce a
full generation away, and within the reign of the present
Emperor. . I noticed an announcement of the presence, on
the first night, of the Minister of our Allies; but nothing
was said about the Russian Minister. If the latter has seen
the play, by now, I do hope that no misconception, arising
out of the barbaric nature of the spectacle, will encourage
him to report too confidently to his Government on the
mediaevalism of Japanese methods.
Humorous relief, as the phrase is, was provided by the
quaint courtesies and self-depreciation of Oriental phrase-
ology; and the use of these gave an easy note of irony to
the terrible scene in Zakkuri's Sword-room; but to have
kept up the convention at the tragic ending in the Bamboo
Forest and to have put the words “Abjectly I ask your
don” in the mouth of Yosan, was perhaps an error of
judgment.
The stage-management on the first night was marvellous;
and the swift, clean, unhesitating movements of all the
supernumeraries was a triumph of intelligent adaptability.
I am glad to think that the brilliant work of the scenic
artists will be publicly recognised at a dinner to be shortly
given to , this branch of the profession by their many
admirers in the world of drama, literature and art. -
I have said nothing of the individual acting of Mr. TREE.
But then I have rarely been able to describe the appear-
ance of anybody who has not been ill-dressed either
through excess or defect. And so with Mr. TREE's perform-
ance, which left the audience entirely satisfied without
the trouble of seeking a reason. ... Who the “Darling of
the Gods” was I never rightly; discovered, but I am sure
that, the Immortals of the Gallery, despite the noisy but
negligible dissent of a small minority, must in their hearts
have assigned to Mr. TREE that flattering title-rôle. O. S.

THE scene is Mrs. RoNALD CAY's reception room, Fifth
Avenue, New York. It is expensively furnished, in one of
the several modes which the custom of the moment allows
to be correct. Mr. PontiUs WATTLE is sitting on an uncom-
fortable chair, his legs crossed, his hat in his hand, his gaze
fixed on the ceiling. He is a man of medium height, about
forty-five or fifty, rather dark, and looks a little like a Baptist
clergyman who is not dependent on his salary. A maid
COrnes in.
The Maid. Mrs. CAY will be down directly, Sir.
Mr. WATTLE's sole comment upon this information is to
uncross his legs, and to recross them, as Mr. HENRY JAMEs
would say, “in the opposite sense.” After a few minutes he
sighs º and bestows with his right forearm a caress
upon his hat.
Mrs. CAY comes in. She is a flexible, gliding person, not
yet forty, with a small head, and a business-like, decidedly
pretty face. Her manner would not be bad if its ease were
a little less determined. -
Mrs. Cay. You wished to see me, Mr. WATTLE.
Mr. Wattle. Yes, Ma'am. I want to put myself in your
hands. I believe you train millionaires, don't you?

the House of Correctness, we teach
them the art of civilised or New York
life.
Mr. W. That's what I want to learn.
I’m a millionaire from Idaho, and I’d
like to settle in New York and kind of
mix up in Society. I’m reckoned a
good mixer.
Mrs. C. I see. But before we go any
further I may as well explain our
methods. You don't mind my being
frank 2
Mr. W. Guess I can stand it.
Mrs. C. Well, there are two things we
have to offer. You must choose. You
know how they do this in London?
Mr. W. No, Ma'am, can't say I do.
Mrs. C. Over there someone would
take you up just as you are, unrectified,
and put you into the best houses. In
a few months you would be going every-
where. But nobody would really want
you anywhere. This we call the
mechanical mixture.
Mr. W. Beg pardon, I don't seem to
follow—?
Mrs. C. It doesn't matter. The
second plan, which we call the chemical
combination, is slower. Its object would
be to make you the kind of person who
gets invited for his own sake.
Mr. W. For my own sake! Ain't
you forgetting I’ve got money?
Mrs. C. My dear man, do you think
me likely to forget that? Please observe,
I said the object of the second plan was
to make your presence desired on its
own account: I didn't say that would
necessarily be its effect.
Mr. W. That's more like it.
Mrs. C. In practice we have found
that no matter which plan we adopt
the result is apt to be a compromise
between the two. Except of course in
extreme cases, when the first plan is
the only one possible.
Mr. W. How long would number two
take, in my case?
Mrs. C. I'm afraid I can't say, Mr.
WATTLE. So many things, chiefly un-
known quantities, have to be considered.
How much money have you?
Mr. W. Am I obliged to answer that?
Mrs. C. O, no. All I mean is, how
much can people be made to believe
you have?
Mr. W. H'm' . . . Between seven and
eight million. Call it seven.
Mrs. C. Nonsense. Call it ten, of
Course.
Mr. W. 0, ten, of course, of course.
Mrs. C. That certainly does simplify
things. They are simpler than if you
had five. Not so simple as if you
had fifteen. In the next place . . .
Mrs. CAY holds her head a little on
one side, and appraises Mr. WATTLE,
who casts down his eyes with modesty.
Mrs. C. In the next place there's . . .
you, Mr. WATTLE.
Lady (entertaining friend's little girl), “Do You TAKE SUGAR, DARLING”
The Darling. “YES, PLEASE.”
Lady. “How MANY LUMPs?”
The Darling. “Oh, About seveN, AND when I'M out to tea I stant with dAKE.”
Mr. W. Meaning, I guess, am I an
asset or a liability? -
Mrs. C. Precisely. I suppose you
don't know if you have any social gifts?
Mr. W. Can't say, Ma'am, at this
longitude.
Mrs. C. Ah!
She reflects a little. A pause.
Mrs. C. Which set would you prefer
to move in 2
Mr. W. Surely there's not more than
one at the top?
Mrs. C. My dear Sir, you have—I am
sorry to say it—much to learn. Do you
prefer intense respectability, or would
a little freedom be more in your line *
Mr. W. Out in Idaho freedom is |
ctable.
Mrs. C. Dear, dear! How shall I
make you understand Ž I fear yours is
an obstinate case, Mr. WATTLE, yet its
difficulty makes it interesting. I am;
willing to try what I can do. My
associates will begin to call on you next
week, and you may come here to dine—or
better, to lunch—with me on Thursday.
Mr. W. I'm sure I'm obliged, Ma'am.
Mrs. C. Don't say that until my bill
is presented.
Seeing Mrs. CAY smile as she says
this, Mr. WATTLE goes away reassured.

GOING ROUND THE CAVES.
(A Sketch from a well-known Watering-place.)
The party of Sightseers, having paid their respective six-
pences and passed the turnstile, find themselves in a
penitential chamber, vaulted and furnished with shallow
and columned alcores, in one of which is displayed a
placard inscribed “Waltz.” ey seat themselves on a
row of kitchen chairs and converse in subdued tones as
they await the official guide, who presently appears bearing
a large flat sconce full of flaring candle-ends.
Guide (with the customary contempt for stops, and a more
than Early-Victorian prodigality in the matter of aspirates).
Ladies and gentlemen the hapartment you are now in it is
the ballroom it has not been built up nothing of the kind
what you see 'ere bein’ hall 'ollered hout of the solid sand-
stone by the discoverer of these caves you will now kindly
foller me . . . (he leads the party down a long corridor with
recesses on both sides, in which more candle-ends are flicker-
ing). This passage forms the new hentrance to the caves
the hideer was taken hoff of the Catacombs of Rome as you
may heasily perceive from the niches and pillars though not
of so hancient a period not 'aving been constructed no longer
than sixty-two years. We now henter the first of these
'ighly hinteresting caves that haperture in front of you was
the i. entrance has may heasily be seen by the steps
cut in the rock which it is supposed that they were done
by the horig'nal hoccupants (here one of the party commits
himself to a statement that the interior is “picturesque,”
while it reminds another of the “Forty Thieves"). The
haperture was haccidently discovered hover sixty years
ago by a gardener of the name of GoLDING while hengaged
in digging the soil fell through the 'ole thereby revealing
the hexistence of the caves he then hobtained leave to make
hexcavations sell the sand for his hown benefit and hexhibit
the caves for a term of years (A ponderous member of the
party expresses an opinion that the caves must be a “very
valuable asset,” which, remembering the sixpence for admis-
sion, nobody seems prepared to dispute). Heleven years he
was in hexecuting the work dying six months hafter com-
pletion so that he did not live long to henjoy the fruits of
his hindustry though his widow and children survived to
in'erit them till quite recently. Now some of you on
be'olding the haperture may hask (here he fixes upon the
most vacuous Sightseer, whose mouth falls open at once)
“Why 'ave a second hentrance at all—why not come in
by this one?” (the W. S., pulling himself together, is under-
stood to murmur something about an “emergency eacit.”)
I will tell you the reason for why the howners of the
surface refused to allow haccess hover their land thus it
consequently became necessary to construct the passage by
which hentrance is now hobtained.
[At this a satirical Sightseer whispers to his Young Lady
that the Guide seems “crule 'ard on pore ole letter
haitch”—to which she signifies assent by a delighted
iggle.
The ºal statue above the harch if you will kindly
stand a little back where I now am is a correck representa-
tion of the Reverend Mr. Biott Mr. GoLDING's minister at
that period bein’ cut out by his own 'ands from the solid
stone without assistance of hany kind except two day
labourers to carry away the sand which you will all agree
with me that for a gardener Mr. GoLDING must have been a
very clever man. (The party inspect the Rev. Mr. Biott's
legs, which are all of him that is visible by candlelight, with
the silent reverence due to High Art, before passing to the
next cave.) Some will tell you that these caves they were all
done by smugglers now that is not a very probable the'ry it
would require consid’rable time and labour to construct
caves of this size and they would need all their time for
smuggling purposes though hundoubtedly these caves they
were used by smugglers halso their hobject bein’ to dispose
of their goods as quickly as possible they would not require
so much room for storage therefore far the most probable
the'ry is that they were due to the Herly Christians who fled
'ere to havoid persecution hunder the hancient Romans and
Hanglo-Saxons. Hon the hupper part of this wall you will
hobserve a large bust (here an elderly lady inquires whether
it is supposed to be the likeness of one of the Early Christians)
from the fact that it is represented with hepaulettes on both
shoulders the general opinion is that it 'as not come down
from hany very remote period and is certainly not hantique ||
it is far more likely to be a portrait of one of the smugglers
but 'oo it is we cannot say not possessing no records of hany:
kind hall we do know is that smugglers were in the 'abit of
º: these caves though we 'ave no hactual proof that they
101 so. - -
Our present KING ladies and gentlemen when he visited
these caves some years ago made a re-mark bein’ Prince of
WALEs at the time. The re-mark he made was that they
would make a very good wine-cellar which I think they
would do so myself. Through this, 'ole 'ere hunder whic
I shall presently hask you to follow me the present
KING and QUEEN passed on the hoccasion the 'ole bein’ then
of far smaller dimensions than it now is their Majesties were
compelled to crawl through it on all fours the widenin' of
the 'ole bein’ hintirely caused by friction from boots below
and clothes above you will please to lower your 'eds to havoid
crushing your 'ats. . . . * -
[The party follow him through the hole, with the jokes and
exclamations appropriate to the situation. - -
Hon this wall near which I am now standing you will
notice one of our most hinteresting monuments a carving
representing the hexact shape of a Roman hurn it has been
suggested that it may be the tomb of some Herly Christian
but a moment's reflection will convince you (here he again
fires the vacuous Sightseer, who looks as convinced as possi-
ble on such short notice) that this hidea cannot be the correct
one and I will tell you for why honly two methods of
sepulchre bein’ practised by the Herly Christians one
cremation the hother hurn-burial now it is hobvious that this
hurn carved as it is on the surface of the solid stone cannot
ssibly contain yuman hashes but is merely a memorial to
oom it is not known the hinscriptions on i. walls around
they are hall modern bein’ done by visitors . . . . -
[They enter the next cave.
'Ere you will hobserve faults (the party assume a critical
air) due to volcanic haction these caves 'aving been cast up
many thousand years ago from the hocean bed in proof of
which I will draw your attention to the roof on which you
can plainly perceive ripple-marks hexactly resembling those
left on the sand at low tide these ripple-marks bein’ hupside
down will give you some hidea of the violence of the herup-
tion it is not my hown opinion I am now giving you but that
of leading scientists who have hexamined them. Kindly step
carefully into the next cave the slope of the floor bein’
somewhat habrupt. . . . The 'alf-length figure on the wall
'ere is supposed to be the work of the Herly Christians from
the full |. bein’ hevidently a bishop.
Hoppersite is a hancient bath when discovered the bottom
was coated hover with clay happarently to 'inder the water ||
from hescaping it has been suggested that it was more pro-
bably hintended to contain a supply of drinkin' water now
that is not a bad suggestion though I think I can show that ||
it is hincorrect for it would soon become stargnant and a
hample supply could be carried in in skins and barrels
therefore it is far more likely that it was used as a babtisimal
fount by the Herly Christians who would merely 'ave to make
a 'ole in the clay to let the water run off and be habsorbed

THE LAMENT OF THE LADIES'
MAN.
IN youth I never cared for sport;
Fresh air was not a passion to me;
Athletic feats of any sort
Sent unresponsive shudders through
me;
I had, in fact, a sedentary mind,
And hated exercise of any kind.
And so, when others smote the sphere
With bat or mallet, boots or putter,
I charmed (with song) the female ear,
And made the female bosom flutter.
I also played the zither and recited
Poems of , young loves, prematurely
blighted.

Fair American. “No; but I HEAR IT highly spoken of '"
I sang, as I have said: I had
That kind of voice that folks call

I trilled of “Memories strangely sad,”
Of “Pansies” and the “Eyes of

Not more divinely does the early bird
Sing when the worm has recently
occurred.
At that delightful hour of gloom,
Slightly anterior to tea-time,
I paralysed the drawing-room
With trifles of my own in three-time,
Till all the air was heavy with Desire,
And prostrate matrons begged me to
retire.
Just then a vogue for High Romance
Prevailed, and I’d a pent-up yearning;
The hollow cheek, the hun glance,
Betrayed the Fever inly i.. ;
At inconvenient times the thing would

Especially when ladies were about.
Somehow the care of female hearts
At that time always fell to my lot;
Within the maze of Cupid's arts
I was their guiding star, their pilot;
Not to have loved me with a blinding
assion
Was, broadly speaking, to be out of
fashi
hion.
But latterly, I don't know why,
That star has waned, until at last I'm
Left in the lurch while maidens fly
Towards the ruder forms of pastime;
And now their talk is all of tennis courts,
Of golf, gymkhanas and athletic sports.
I don't complain. I know there'll be
One of these days a mild renaissance

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 6, 1904.
JOSEPHUS TYRANNUS.
(Being a recently discovered fragment of a Greek Drama, rendered
into English both freely and literally by a Committee of Fiscal experts.)
DRAMATIS PERSONAE,
Josephus (a Brumperialist),
Balfour (the Child),
The Duke (a High Priest),
Winston (a Youth),
Chorus of Tariff Reform Commissioners, Chaplins, Howorths,
Howard Vincents, Vinces, Wanklyns, dée.
ScFNE–The Court of a Temple. In the centre of the Court
stands an altar. Beside it is Josephus, wrapped in
thought and a short cloak, on which are legibly embroi-
dered the words “Made in Holland.” The Chorus is
grouped in the background.
Josephus (soliloquizes). Now indeed is the accepted time,
for to me, borne hither on a King's war-galley from South
African shores, the prospect was not otherwise than dark,
and from the puny #. of them that I had left behind
power, not for the first time, seemed to have escaped notice
all but slipping away. For, on the one side, discord had
raised horrid shouts among those who, worshipping some in
one temple some in another, cannot endure that the city's
appointed high priests should grasp more drachmae than
seemed to be fair, and, on the other side, as to the war, which
verily was to me as a waving feather in my head-gear, some
things had resulted in sixes and some in sevens, and there
was a clamour amongst the citizens, asking that someone
should perish by the hemlock, a potion void of sweetness.
Wherefore to me reflecting on these things came the fear
lest I too should suffer a smirching and be precipitated into
dishonour, losing the favour of the citizens and the good
words of them that say, “Lo, this is he, the queller of foes:
let us bow down before him, for he is in truth a ruler know-
ing the minds of men and not unacquainted at least with his
own.” Now therefore my word has gone forth and my plan is
ordained, so that henceforth, if by their votes the people will
establish me, each man shall be as rich as his fellows, ay,
and richer too. And may the gods give a favourable issue,
for to them I make my vows, prepared to sacrifice a child,
dearer to me even than the white hair of JESSE, on the altars.
[The doors of the Temple are flung open, and through them
advances the Child, innocently arrayed in white
garments for sacrifice, and followed by the DUKE,
nobed in the vestments of the Sacrificial Priest. They
take their stand by Joseph Us while the Chorus comes
forward and sings.
CHORUs.
Oh, mother of many magnificences, fertile breeder of
daughter-countries, broad-bosomed and mighty-armed
England, lo, now is the season perfected for the giving of
a sign, now is the word come swift from the mutton-haunted
Seddonian pastures, labour-run, democratic and loud-
tongued; and from the snowy vesture of Canadian tracts
it springs, strong-limbed, rejoicing in fruitfulness. . And to
us too it has spoken, to us dim-eyed, groping in darkness,
whether in hope of profit each one for himself we plunge
our desiring hands deep into another's store of hardly-earned
wealth, or, waving for our Protection the tattered banners of
our sires that perished sixty years ago, and brandishing
their swords notched in ancient conflicts and defaced with
disgracing rust, we follow the life-giver, thirsting for spoil.
For to us lately standing on the topmost battlements and
looking out over the sea came a marvellous sight. Grey was
the sky and grey the roof of Poseidon's mansion, but on a
sudden, lo, a rosy flush tinted the western limits of ocean,
sprinkled with foam as of fish leaping in the rays of the sun.
|Ruddier and ruddier it grew, extending ever towards us
until our souls were drenched in redness. Ruddier still it
came, and a voice sounded over the wastes of the many-
furrowed merchandise-infested sea saying, “Firm must be
the hand that shall wield the Harengus, the red Harengus,
the diverter of the following foe, the promoter of forgetful-
ness.”
And now on a sudden awaked from dreams each one of us
clutches his sword again:
It is better to die in a whirl of wealth than live in poverty,
dearth and pain.
| And CHAPLIN, squire of our hearts' desire, and Howorth, lord
| of the pointed pen,
| And WANKLYN, wordily wild in woe, they have each brought
hither a troop of men.
From the North and South, from the East and West com-
missioners hurry at Joseph's call;
“Each for himself,” is the song they sing, “and the d––l
may catch the fools who ji:
And, oh, what a grinding sound comes forth, for each of
them brings his private axe
To be brightened and ground and turned out sharp on a
beautiful brand-new tariff tax.
Worship, and praise to the Bird belong, to the Oof-Bird
hatched in a Midland town;
Worship and praise to the golden haze that circles the great
Bird swooping down;
Worship and praise and prayer and song from man and
WOman in: death-doomed Child
To the Bird, the glorious sovereign Bird, as he utters his
native bank-notes wild.
With pearly buttons his breast is bright, and, oh, or ever he
left his nest,
The hand of our Joseph tricked him out with morocco jewels
around his crest;
And those who have much, but want much more from the
marvellous Bird by Joseph hatched,
Sing “Joe, my Joe, I will scratch your back, for I have a
back that must be scratched.”
[The Chorus retires to back of stage, leaving Josephus,
the Child, and the DUKE.
Josephus (to the Duke). The sacrifice is prepared and the
gods demand their offering. Is thy knife whetted, thou
grey-beard?
The Duke. Ay, that it is; (aside) and for thee too,
insulter of grey-beards, is the edge sharpened. But an ox
shall walk upon my tongue lest my words betray me.
(Aloud, to the Child). Come forward, for the altar is ready,
and the people stand round waiting.
Josephus (to the Child). Oh, sweeter to me than the petals
of orchids, pride of mine eyes and nurseling of my later
years, thou art about to die.
The Child (meekly). Yea, for coming hither I am indeed
come to the threshold of Pluto's palace.
Josephus. And thy dear companions, where hast thou left

The Child. Companion me no companions, for I must go
the dark road alone, since thou commandest.
Josephus. Yea, verily, necessity is a hard task-mistress.
The Child (ironically). And she to thee was no doubt a
teacher in the house.
Josephus. All men must die, but not all together. Where-
fore it profits that thou first, and I will abide the day
appointed for me and will labour on.
he Child. Labour is for them that labour, but I, being
dead, cannot labour, for a man once embarked upon the Styx
returns not ever.
Josephus. Yea, for to die and to live are two distinct
things.

THE RULING PASSION.
Sporting Tradesman (after a fall, feeling in his pocket). “Cash ALL RIGHT, Anyway!”
THE NEW POETICS.
[It is affirmed week after week by a certain
critic that our serious drama will never be
serious enough until it ceases to concern itself
with the relations between men and women.
According to him, evidently, love is a hack-
neyed stage convention for which life offers no
excuse. If this is so, presumably politics or
finance will be the themes of the new drama.]
'Twas held of yore dramatic art
Should raise—if you ignore mere
farces–
Pity and terror in the heart,
Thereby effecting their katharsis.
This scheme the Stagirite devised,
And we may still accept his notions,
Allowing for our modernised
Emotions.
The maid of Athens, when she heard
Electra urging to the slaughter,
|Paled at the foul unnatural word
And shrank from that revolting
daughter.
The matron, when the “double blow"
Had silenced Clytaemnestra's groaning,
Suffered her own maternal woe
Unmoaning.
Elizabethan wives turned white
To see the Moor with ruthless pillows
Slay Desdemona for her quite
Imaginary peccadilloes.
Purged by the scene upon the boards,
And over-awed by such disasters,
They gladly bore their jealous lords
And masters.
To-day we see the playwrights ring
The changes on the old old story;
They think that love is still the thing,
And problems in their primal glory.
And yet we gaze with callous eye.
On dramas that we used to care for
Unchastened. What can be the why
And wherefore?
It is that love has passed away;
Your tender sentiment and passion
Are relics of a by-gone day,
Survivals of a faded fashion.
If you would touch a heart to-night,
Give us no more your sweets and
honey—
Give us our ruling passion! Write
Of money!
Consols and Kaffirs, shipping rings,
The last quotations from the City,
These are to-day the only things
That rouse our terror and our pity.
And soon the dramatist shall cease
To pocket anything substantial
Unless he learns to make his piece
Financial.
For when we see the millionaire
Engaged in mighty speculations,
Financing cotton corners there,
And here tobacco combinations;
When we behold in ruin thrown
All the concerns the hero bosses,
At once we shall forget our own
Small losses.
WEEK-END WRINKLES.
(By the Expert.)
LUGGAGE AND EQUIPMENT.
It is difficult to know how much or
how little to take away for a week-end,
but it is always as well to be on the safe
side. Personally, for a three or four
days' trip I never take less than five
pieces, three of which are labelled and
two go under the seat. This is exclusive
of my gun-case, camera, golf sticks, and
air crishion. In the van I also take a
brace of beagles, and, when my desti-
nation is the Shires, a couple of remounts.
Perhaps I had better specify what the
various pieces are and what they con-
tain. In the large hair trunk are seven
pairs of boots, each carefully wrapped
up in paper, a pair of list slippers for
bedroom use, dancing pumps, puttees,
and gums. Then comes a layer of slum-
ber wear, lounge suits, knickers and
aquascuta, while the arched top is filled
with Homburg and other hats, as I am
one of those who believe in the efficacy
of constantly changing one's headgear.
At the bottom of my kit-bag is my
saddle, the remaining space being filled
with collars, cuffs and “dickeys,” which
are absolutely indispensable. In my
fitted dressing-bag rº. my tooth-
brush. I make a point of packing this
myself, and never let my man do it.
I shall never forget the difficulty I had
in borrowing a toothbrush from Lord
– at Molar Grange, although I made
it clear that I would return it in the

morning. Should white shirts be re-
quired they can always be extracted
from a station show-case when the
officials are not looking, but it is best to
remove the pink collar-stud before use.
ON THE Journey.
Never be careless about your get-up
or manners when travelling. An act of
civility to a stranger, the offer of a
match or a sandwich, may lead to most
desirable and profitable acquaintances.
To give an instance, I owed my first
invitation to Melton Mowbray entirely
to the fact that Sir CHARLEs –—, who
was travelling in the same compartment
with me down to Esher, had forgotten
his cigar-case. I saw him feeling in his
kets, guessed the cause, and offered
i. a fine Borneo which I had bought
on the way to the station.
As regards refreshments, a flask is
indispensable. Whatever you do, avoid
carrying your liquor in a medicine-
bottle. When I was an undergraduate
at All Souls, Oxford, and before I knew
what was what, I missed one of the
chances of my life by making that
mistake. I was returning from the
“Long Vacuum ” on the Continent,
and after a roughish passage got into
the train at Dover. A stylish-looking
elderly man was the only other passenger,
and shortly after we had started he
said, “I wonder if you could let me
have some brandy. I am feeling rather
faint.” As ill-luck would have it, all
the brandy I had got was in an old
Elliman's Embrocation bottle, and when
I offered it to him he waved it aside,
saying, “After all, perhaps I am better
without it.” Imagine my feelings when,
on arriving at Victoria, a servant
addressed him as “Your Grace.” One
more point: be careful in the purchase
of newspapers. My own rule is to go
in for variety. The Athenaeum, the
Sportsman, Science Siftings, and the
Pilot, are a good selection.
THE ART of TIPPING.
We are here treading on very delicate
ground. An Englishman's house is his
castle, and he naturally does not wish
his retinue to be corrupted by indis-
criminate largesse. Still, the labourer
is worthy of his hire; though, person-
ally, if I could have my way, I should
like to keep it to bronze or gifts in
kind. These latter, however, must be
bestowed with nice discrimination. I
shall never forget the expression of
rapture of a footman at Lord WIMPOLE's
when, after a two months' stay at
Wigmore Castle, I slipped into his
hand a pair of Argosy braces. One of
the pulleys was missing, but otherwise
it was a sound and classy article. Still
it is not in the power of every one of the
readers of Yesterday to fit the douceur
to the douces — as our lively Gallic

neighbours say — with such perfect
success. Hence, the average man had
best pay his tips in specie.
Hardly a week passes but I receive
several letters asking me whether or
not one should tip one's host. This
depends. For one thing, one does not
always know who one's host is. If his
table is liberal, his cellar above sus-
picion—and readers of Yesterday will
know what I mean—if he puts one at
one's ease by occasionally remarking
“It’s a cold day,” he certainly ought to
have a trifle. But be sure you give it
in coin or postal orders (not crossed)
or even stamps, never by cheque. I
remember when I was still a subaltern
tendering a cheque to the Earl of –.
He took it--I subsequently found that
he cashed it at his butcher's the same
day—but he never asked me to ——
Castle again. The need of making sure
which of the gentlemen is your host I can
best illustrate by another little anecdote.
I had been staying at -— Towers for
cub shooting one July, and on leaving
ressed the usual honorarium into the
hand, as I thought, of my noble host.
His look of surprise caused me to make
some inquiries of the coachman who was
tooling me to the nearest junction, and I
discovered to my intense chagrin that
he was a distant and untitled cousin. To
make the solecism all the more glaring
he was actually in need of money.
To come now to the tipping of ser-
vants, which is of course obligatory in
the stately homes of England. Amounts
differ according to the rank and prestige
of the recipient. Butlers, like cigar-
ettes, should be tipped with gold. (If
you have no gold, then you had better
tip and run.) I get many letters on the
subject of the modus operandi of bestow-
ing tips. Mementos for chambermaids
should be left on the washstand, not too
conspicuously, and yet not so clandes-
tinely as to run the risk of being swept
into the slop-pail. By the way, I recol-
lect when I was staying with the
Hon. HILDEBRAND BRooks, on Monkey
Island, for the Henley week, that, owing

to the peculiarity of my host, no wash-
stand was provided. I was consequently
obliged to leave it under the door-mat.
It was my good fortune to be asked to
pay a second visit the following year,
and to be allotted the same cubicle. I
thought I was looked upon askance by
the neat-handed Phyllis, and was
puzzled to fathom the reason until, on
my usual tour of inspection, before
retiring to rest, I discovered that the
coin was still under the mat. Needless
to say that on leaving I added another
sixpence to it.
-
“THE LORDLIEST LIFE ON
EARTH.”
[The title of these verses is borrowed from
Mr. Kipling, who employed it, when writing
in defence of compulsory military service.
propos of that defence it may be noted that
Lieut. Schilling and Sergeant FRANzky, both of
the German army, have just been sentenced to
fifteen months and five years respectively for
maltreating their men. FRANzky was in the
habit of enforcing discipline with a cudgel or
riding whip. On this Reuter notes as “inter-
esting” that Count zu LIMBURG-STRUM, in a
recent debate in the Reichstag, “expressed the
view that sergeants could hardly get their men
into shape, especially Socialists, without a
certain number of blows”!]
Count Von Stir-'em-up speaks :-
My countrymen, be calm, I pray,
And hear what I have got to say
About Lieutenant SCHOCKING's case
And Sergeant WoppeNHEIM's disgrace.
Weigh well the views that I express,
And you will readily confess
That they are gallant fellows and
A credit to the Fatherland.
Lieutenant SchocKING, I maintain,
Should certainly be tried again;
The sentence which the Court decreed
Is far too long. It is indeed.
Shall Prussian officers be sent
To actual imprisonment
For having knocked about the head
Some private (subsequently dead)?
Granted that there are safer regions
On which to whack our German legions,
Still 'twas but an excess of zeal
Directed to the common weal,
And, far from being reprehended,
Ought to be tacitly commended.
To Sergeant WoppeNHEIM I doubt
If justice has been meted out.
Some sentimental people here
Pretend that he was too severe
When visiting with castigations
The soldier's breach—of regulations.
If any private made a slip
He caught it with a riding-whip,
And generally caught it hot!
To which my answer is, “Why not?”
'Tis simply folly to suppose
A “certain quantity of blows”
Is not a necessary thing
For teaching people soldiering.
And people who pretend to say
Drill can be tº: some other way
Completely fail to understand
The army of the Fatherland.
So let's agree Lieutenant S.,
And Sergeant WoppENHEIM no less,
Have both been wrongfully accused,
And very very badly used.
A stick is always useful in
The maintenance of discipline—
And sergeants handy with their fists
Are much the best with Socialists'
The sergeants tell me this is so,
And surely sergeants ought to know?
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The title of Mr. MAARTEN MAARTENs'
collection of short stories, My Poor
Relations (CoNSTABLE), reflects the
humanity which shines from every page
of the book. I have only a traveller's
acquaintance, says my Nautical Retainer,
with life in Dutch villages, but it takes
no very fine instinct to recognise here
the signs of intimate observation. Mr.
MAARTENs has shown himself inde-
pendent of the artificial devices of his
craft. He has no recourse to coinci-
dence, the shocks of chance, or “moving
accidents by flood and field.” He takes
these existences, sordid, mean, and
colourless (save for the annual Ker-
messe), and finds in their essential
qualities all the artistic material he
needs for tragedy, comedy, or satire.
He never idealises, in the vulgar sense;
at most over the grey landscape and
the greyer hearts of his characters he
throws something of the atmosphere of
his own buoyancy, but often, as in the
story of ". Banquet,” so astonish-
ingly alive in its unfamiliar detail, he
seems to project nothing of himself into
the crude facts of his theme. But all
the while he is covering up the trace
of his processes; and if the result
appears easy of attainment this is the
artist's triumph. One hears rumours
that the short story has had its vogue;
but such a collection as this of Mr.
MAARTENs should go a long way to
restore the popularity of that most diffi-
cult and exquisite form of art.
There is always a certain freshness
of charm about the work of the “Author
of Miss Molly,” and her latest novel,
The Great Reconciler (METHUEN), should
bring her many new friends. As far
as the book-lore of my Nautical Retainer
goes, the main scheme is original. From
the passionate appeals of her lover—in
t unrequited, in part rejected from
|. of enterprise—the lady finds shelter
in the platonic affections of a dilettante
admirer. This simple friendship, on
her side, develops into something
stronger, but when she gets her freedom
it is to find that on his side no corre-
sponding development was ever con-
templated. It comes at last, but not
till disillusionment has finally closed
that chapter of her life's romance, and
she has learned to recognise the un-
satisfying nature of a love that has in it
no element of passion.
Apart from the principal characters
there is an admirable study of a Boer
girl, irreconcilable to English tastes and
types. A solitary exception divides her
loyalty, and from this devotion springs
the tragedy which gives its name to
the book. The closing scenes, laid in
South Africa during the late War, are
perhaps disproportionately short. More
s might well have been spared to
them from the earlier chapters of the
book, which move slowly, hampered by
much dialogue that is pleasurably
otiose. The book, indeed, id: balance;
just as, in detail, its diction is too
loosely spontaneous. As for the reck-
lessness of the punctuation, though this
delightful author may plead a soul above
such details, neither º nor any other
excuse can be accepted from the printer's
reader. And hereto the Baron sets his seal.
BARON
MY EPITAPH.
[The Englishman need have no fear of losing
his reputation for pluck and endurance, while
he continues to wear without a groan the fancy
waistcoat of startling hue, knitted for him by
his own or other people's sisters.]
DEAR, when I have departed
From this abode of gloom,
And my remains are carted
Into the hollow tomb,
Shed thou no tears for me, but o'er
The spot where I am laid
Inscribe these simple words, “He wore
The waistcoat which I made.”
There where the grass waves greenly,
And earth is glad with flowers,
Love, I shall sleep serenely
Through quiet, dreamless hours.
The passing throng shall knownomore
Than this—that one obeyed
Till death his lady's will, and wore
The waistcoat which she made.

CHARIVARIA.
A MADMAN succeeded in getting into
the French Chamber of Deputies the
other day, and expressed a wish to be
Premier. It is a sign of the change
for the better which has recently come
over French politics, that our papers
should think this item of news worth
recording. -
A propos of the KAISER's recent Water-
loo speech, a German paper declares
that we know the truth to be as stated,
and draws attention to the “significant
fact” that the completion of the Wel-
lington Monument in St. Paul's Cathe-
dral is not being proceeded with.
The War Office is taking steps to
turn its surplus cavalry men into foot
soldiers. We see nothing ridiculous in
the idea—as some persons profess to.
We already have Mounted Infantry.
Now we are to have Dismounted Cavalry.
No date has yet been fixed for the
termination of the Somali War.
The recent cold snap served to draw
attention to a fact which puzzles many
persons, namely, that, although the
wearers of costly fur overcoats are com-
aratively few, yet that sort of overcoat
is taken by mistake, from restaurants
º clubs, far oftener than any other
kind.
It is stated that the X-rays will turn
a negro white, if not all over, then in
parts. It is quite possible that speckled
negroes will be the rage next year.

THE FATAL MOUSTACHE,
I
I write this at the request of my
Mother—whom, I am glad to think, I
have hardly ever disobeyed. She hears
that MAUDE, and MAUDE's Mother, are
spreading false reports as to the reason
why the engagement was broken off,
and she wishes the truth known for my
family's sake. She will then, she says,
be quite willing to let the world judge
as to who was dishonourable—the girl
who was false to her plighted word, or
the man who was willing to live a lie
for the sake of her whom he loved. She
also desires me to state that she never
took a fancy to MAUDE, while she saw
the sort of woman Mrs. SEVIER was from
the moment she set eyes on her. She
realised, she declares, from the begin-
ning, that MAUDE was not d enough
for me, and that MAUDE and her mother
were both after my money. The reason
why she did not caution me was that
she saw my heart was set on MAUDE,
and —like the angel that she is -she
did not wish to interfere with my
happiness. I should mention that no
cross word has ever passed between my
Mother and º Did I write
“never” 2 Perhaps I should not have
said that. Once, and once only, did my
dear Mother and I have a little difference,
and then it was over MAUDE. MAUDE
had a cold, and my Mother forbade me
to kiss her while it lasted, in case I
should catch it. But even then, I
remember, my Mother's loving thought-
fulness found a way out, and after a
few days we came to an arrangement by

which MAUDE was to kiss me
on the cheek, so that Iran no |
risk of infection.
Now that I know how dis-
tasteful the alliance would
have been to my Mother, I
consider it a great blessing
—indeed, I sometimes fancy
that I can trace in it the hand
of Providence—that matters
should, have turned out as
they have.
And I think it also shows
this: that, in the selection of
a wife, one ought to consult
one's Mother. It had always
been my habit before taking
a step of any importance—
and, indeed, in many little
things — to take my dear
Mother's opinion, and I can-
not imagine how I came to
propose to MAUDE without
doing so. It has certainly
been a lesson which I shall
not forget throughout my life,
To think how near I came
to making an irreparable
blunder! For I see plainly
now how unsuited we should
have been to one another.

of all kinds of sports, while I

- ||also most hurt at MAUDE's re-
mark about my mouth : she
insisted that it was a fine
mouth, and that it gave me
character, and that on no
account was I to hide it with
a moustache. I recollect I
had some difficulty in pre-
venting her from writing to
MAUDE on the subject. She
wished to say that anyhow I
had not a face like a doll,
and would have gone on to
drawattention to her (MAUDE's)
Mother's mouth. Dear Mother
never got on well with Mrs.
SEVIER. She also said she
would be seriously displeased
if I ever had my hair touched.
Soon after this I got a nasty
cough—I am very delicate,
and have to wear woollen
things all the year round—
and, as it had not gone at the
end of a week, acting on my
mother's advice I went to the
South Coast for a month.
While there I could not help
thinking over MAUDE's sugges-
tion about the moustache, and
finally came to the decision
that, to please her, I would
grow one. It would be as
well to let Bob see that I
hold them all to be dangerous.
Myself, I like reading good books. MAUDE
would scarcely ever read, and then it
would only be a trashy novel. MAUDE
(as it turned out) has a dreadful temper.
I have schooled myself to overcome all
passions. Worst of all, MAUDE was only
religious when she had a new hat.
My dear Mother has been in the room
while I have been writing these lines.
She has just laid aside the comforter
she is knitting for me, and kissed me
Good-night.
And yet, although I clearly realise
what a grave mistake the match would
have been, still, somehow, try as I may,
I cannot bring myself to dislike MAUDE
as my Mother tells me I ought, and as I
Ynow I ought. It is curious, and I hate
Ayself for it. I imagine now she will
marry her cousin, the great hulking,
medical student, and I find I cannot
dislike her enough to wish this. I
hold that the correct definition of the
word “gentleman" is “a gentle man.”
You might search far to find anyone
further removed from this description
than this cousin of MAUDE's. I will only
say that he is as vulgar as his name,
which is Bob, and anyone less worthy to
marry MAUDE than this loutish fellow,
reeking of brute strength and filthy
tobacco—this rowdy—I was almost say-
ing this Hooligan–I cannot conceive.
The thought that this coarse fellow
should marry MAUDE makes me shudder,
and now and then I wonder whether I
could forgive her, to save her from this.
If only she had not been so rude at
the end. I should mention that she
was pretty—in a worldly sort of way.
Well, the facts will not take long to
tell.
For some little time—a chance remark
or two of MAUDE's gave me the hint—I
had had an idea, which I was reluctant
to believe, that MAUDE was dissatisfied
with my personal appearance. One
evening I taxed her with it. At first,
she fenced the question, but I kept her
to it, and finally she said she thought I
was “All right” except for my mouth,
and she wondered I did not grow, a
moustache like Bob's. Also, she wished
I would have my hair cut shorter, like
Bob's. I was rather nettled at first—
although I kept control of myself. I
told her that Bob was not at all my
ideal of a man, and that, if she liked
Bob's mouth and hair, it was a pity she
did not have the rest of Bob as well.
As for my hair, I did not intend to be
like every common fellow, you saw in
the street. At this she began to shed
tears, and said it was a shame, as I had
forced her to say it; and then, after
being stern for a little, I made it up,
declaring that anyhow she had a pretty
enough mouth for the two of us, when
she did not cry. My Mother afterwards
told me I should not have said this, as
it was liable to make her vain, and I
believe she was right. My Mother was
could do the same as he if I wanted
to. In this I was running counter to
the wishes of my Mother, and it is
quite possible that what happened was
a judgment on me. I consulted a
barber, and he recommended me a
preparation which he declared would
be effective, if anything could, in a
fortnight.
However, after a fortnight's use,
nothing came but a rash, which was
very ugly, so I went to the man to
complain. . While waiting in the shop,
my attention was attracted by some
sham moustaches on a card. The
fancy seized me that I would like to
see how I looked in one. So I put one
on. It completely altered me. The
effect was #. and worldly. I was
handing the thing back to the man—
who, though his opinion had not been
asked, had declared impertinently that
it was a distinct improvement—when
suddenly I thought, No, I would buy it.
A joke had struck me. Although
naturally of a serious disposition, I am
yet fond of an occasional innocent piece
of fun—so long as it causes no pain to
others, and so long, I would add, as it
is really funny. wi. I object to is
the senseless buffoonery that one sees so
much of nowadays, when any vulgarity
seems to pass for wit. The idea that had
occurred to me was this. When next I
was to see MAUDE I would wear the false
moustache! It would do no harm, I

thought, to let her know that her cousin
was not the only one who could make
jokes. And it would rid her, once and

MUSICAL NOTES.
WE have received the following inte-
resting communication from a highly
cultivated amateur, whose
became a Hungarian citizen, spent
Christmas learning how to dance the
Czardas—the national Magyar dance—

czimbalom. Sir FREDERICK BRIDGE has

of the difficulty of finding suitable

Mr. GEORGE MooRE, who was driven
out of England by the cruel neglect of
theatrical managers, has recently been
subjected to a merciless persecution by
Italian organ-grinders in Dublin. It is
rumoured that the eminent novelist is

equalled by his keen interest
in the national pastime :-
“I went the other afternoon
to hear R. STRAUss's Tone
Poem Rhodes und Macla-
rung,” given by the Queen's
Hall team under SAMMY Wood.
The scoring was heavy. The
audience missed catching the
motivi which are not of an
Italian nature--such, for in-
stance, as Signor TossETTI, the
Essex composer, indulges in
– and owing to a want of
activity on the part of the
lunga pausa or long-stop,
there were not a few Lully-
byes. The execution of the
joem was not altogether fault-
|. The first clarinet made
two short slips, after the last
of which I remarked to a
gifted critic who sat next to
me, ‘He was out, LEGGE, be-
fore.' PAYNE, the leader, made
a few runs, mostly chromatic,
off his chin-pad, and Wood
was nearly caught at counter-
point during the first overture
off the HANDEL of his own bāt-
on. The recent performance
by the pupils of the Royal
College of Music (over which
HUBERT PARRY, the celebrated
football player and half-BACH,
presides) was most enjoyable,

this three-year-old marvel will be re-
peated—teething permitted—next Tues-
day. Already every available bed in
Boscombe and the neighbourhood is se-
cured, and thousands of enthusiasticama-
teurs are preparing to sleep on or under
billiard tables on the night of the concert.

that de mortuis non est disputandum,
hesitates to mention that the poem

the work of Mr. CYRIL H. BRETIIERTON.

popular FALLACIES.
NEXT to the habit of searching for
hidden specie, nothing is more charac:
teristic of the modern Renaissance of
British Energy than the scholarly crav-
ing to identify ..". How sig-
nificant is the following passage from
the Daily Chronicle of the 7th instant:
“A discussion has been going on in one of
our weekly contemporaries as to the origin
of the phrase "bag and baggage,' it havin
been suggested º *: GLADsrose i.
it duri is speech-making campaign agains
#. .. It . º been
promptly pointed out that the words are Shak-
speARE's, coming from Touchstone's ‘Let us
make an honourable retreat; though not with
bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.”
Mr. Punch, ever anxious to encourage
the arduous pursuit of Learning, has
here collated a few similar examples of
popular superstition, which he desires
to dispel by the 50-radium-power shafts
of Terewth.
1. “A Power, not ourselves, that makes
for Righteousness.”—This remarkable
phrase has also been attributed to Mr.
GLADSTONE in connection with the Bul-
garian atrocities above referred to. He
is supposed to have used it as a peri-
phrasis for Holy Russia. Actually,
however, the phrase was originally
atented, for other uses, by the late
r. MATTHEw ARNOLD.
2. “Adorable Dreamer!”—It was the
same distinguished critic who first em-
ployed this form of invocation when
apostrophising the University of Oxford.
The discovery of its comparatively re-
mote origin has naturally shaken the
theory that it was first adopted in the
early days of 1904 by Lord RoseBERY
when asked to confirm the report that
he had joined a coalition under the
leadership of the Duke of DEVONSHIRE.
3. “The flow of soul.”—This luminous
expression was supposed to have been
invented by Sir OLIVER LoDGE in a recent
lecture on the possibilities of establish-
ing communication with departed spirits.
The passage in which it originally occurs
has now been unearthed, and from the
context, “The feast of reason,” it is
clear that the author, a Mr. Pope, em-
ployed it with a totally different signifi-
cation.
4. “Full many a gem of purest ray.”
—A similar discussion in the sphere of
metaphysics has been the cause of
another literary error, by which the
above phrase has been attributed to an
admirer of the correspondence lately
contributed to the Times by Professor
RAY LANKESTER. Careful investigation
has revealed the fact that these words
were originally composed in a church-
yard at Stoke by Mr. GRAY some ninety-
six summers before the learned Pro-
fessor assumed his notorious Christian
name.
5. “The terrors of his beak.”—The
same poet invented this phrase in refer-
ence to the Eagle of Jove. This dis-
covery disposes of the popular belief
that it was originally applied to Mr.
Plowden by a poetic constable attached
to the Marylebone Police Court.
6. “The Passionate Shepherd.”— It
now transpires that it is to CHRISTOPHER
MARLowe and not Mr. JESSE CoLLINGs
that this exquisite headline must be
ascribed. The actual title of Mr. JESSE
CoLLINGs' tribute of adoration to Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN was as follows: The Pas-
sionate Cowherd to his Love. His in-
debtedness to MARLowe is, however,
obvious and beyond repudiation.
7. “Thalassa / Thalassa ' " — This
remark has now been identified as
originating with a certain Greek War
Correspondent of the name of XENOPHON,
who first used it in a work entitled
The Anabasis. Lord CURzoN's expres-
sion “To Lhassa / To Lhassa / " is
therefore proved to be clearly derivative
rather than original, as generally sup-
posed. It is to the Regius Professor
of Greek at the University of Sikkim
that we are indebted for this scholarly
correction.
8. “Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.”—
Mr. WANKLYN has not been allowed to
enjoy for very long the distinction of
inventing this phrase to describe the
possible progress of Mr. HAROLD Cox to
the Bradford poll. It has been shown
by a member of the Cobden Club that
the phrase has nothing to do with
political candidature, having been in-
vented by Lord BYRON, whose position
as a Peer precluded him from taking
any share in Parliamentary elections.
9. To “cap” a man.—The recently
published Creevey Papers have thrown
a flood of light upon the origin of a
phrase which was wrongly supposed to
have been first employed at the Univer-
sities in the Early Victorian Period. It
appears that one of BLüCHER's subordi-
nates, by name WELLINGTON, had acquired
an external coating of polish from the
French, who always made a habit of
taking off their headpieces to the
enemy before charging; and that, in
conveying an order, at the Battle of
Waterloo, to one of the few surviving
British regiments, he made use of the
remarkable phrase: “Hup! Guards !
and hat 'em '''
10. “They have their exits.”—This
statement, being part of an observation
made to an interviewer by a member
of the L.C.C. (the rest of it running as
follows: “but in case of a fire they
would probably be bolted"), was sup-
posed to be original: but it has now
been traced to WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE by
the indignant proprietor of the Ele-
phantodrome. O. S.

WE have often heard it said that
British Sport is in a bad way, but we
trust the case is not as desperate as the
following extract from an advertisment
would have us believe:–

A German Socialist editor has been
sentenced to three months' imprisonment
for lêse majesté for stating that the
German EMPEROR received £2,000 daily
for appending his signature to docu-
ments. We i. no idea the amount
was larger. --
The sensational announcement which
has been made to the effect that Pro-
fessor PANCOAST, of the University of
Pennsylvania, who has been conducting
the bleaching experiments with the X
rays, is already prepared to fit up
negroes with permanent white collars
and shirt fronts, is premature, and cal-
culated to cause widespread disappoint-
ment.

consisting of the following words:-
ALL HATCHETS

It has always been the Englishman's
pride that no section of the public is
denied protective legislation. A Pistols
Act has now been passed in the interests
of our burglars.
Even in Servia a certain number of
persons were horrified at the recent
regicide. These are said to be now
plotting to kill the present KING.
It is rather annoying to learn from a
Russian newspaper that, even if our
expedition reaches Lhassa, the revolt of
the Lama and his followers against
British oppression will end by bringing
Thibet into the Russian sphere of influ-
ence. It would have been more friendly
of the Peterburgskiya Vyedomosti if it
had pointed this out to us before we
had gone to considerable expense in the
matter.
Reuter reports that the tents of the
British troops in Thibet are daily sur-
rounded by crowds of admiring natives,
and it is rumoured that our War Office,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE UBIQUITOUS GORDONS AND THE
INIQUITOUS CLUBBOCKS.
(A suggestion for Chapter One of the projected Serial in
Mr. W. T. Stead's new Journal.)
Introduction.—Just seen Preliminary Announcement in
The Daily Paper of Great Historical Serial Romance of the
World's Life, which is “to vitalise the idea of the National
Life, and clothe the skeleton outline of facts recorded from
day to day, by telegram or otherwise, in the daily papers
with the living, throbbing flesh and blood of an actual human
interest.”
Central idea appears to be to have groups of characters:
some “White Knights,” who are to be “more or less idealised
portraits of actual representatives of the good causes and
progressive movements of our time” (and, of course, no
connections of the White Knight in “Alice”); “Black
Knights,” representing “the elements of self-indulgence,
cynicism, pessimism, Jingoism,” &c.; and “Grey Knights,”
who are to be “mixed characters.” These groups to be
distributed between two families; most of the W. Knights
“members of the family of Lord GoRDON of Rockstone”;
Black Knights, “largely of the kith and kin of RICHARD
CLUBBoCK.” When “once the story gets started, it will never
end,” and “nothing will happen on the surface of this planet
that is of sufficient interest to occupy space in the newspapers
in which either one or other member of these ubiquitous
families will not be quite in the heart of things.” The aim
being to bring the great World-Drama home to “the
Sempstress, the Shopman, the Artisan, and the common-place
unimaginative Middle-class.”
Sounds magnificent. Unfortunately the Editor despairs
of finding the “Journalist-Novelist or Novelist-Journalist”
capable of carrying out the conception. Seems to think he
may have to evolve him. But is that necessary? May there
not be some among us who already possess the necessary
*...* Why not º my ift at the opening
!hapter—just to start the thing? All I have to do is to
select a few items of interest from columns of daily paper,
string them on to a thread of story which will thrill the
Sempstress and the Artisan—and the thing's done. So
here goes:—
CHAPTER THE FIRST
“But surely, Sir RICHARD,” pleaded Lord GoRDON of Rock-
stone, his noble features flushed with generous enthusiasm
as he addressed the head of the house of CLUBBock (better
make RICHARD a Baronet—baronets always bad in Sempstresses'
fiction). “Surely you sympathise with such a cause as mine
—a cause which is to ”—(Shall leave details to be filled in
by Mr. STEAD; not quite sure which particular cause he would
prefer Lord GoRDON to champion).
The Baronet's mean and malignant countenance was
convulsed by a Satanic sneer as he gave vent to sentiments
respecting the cause in question of so appallingly cynical,
pessimistic, and Jingoistic a character that it is impossible
to record them in a paper intended for the Home!
“I desire to live in charity with even the lowest of m
fellow creatures,” said Lord §º. with great self-control,
“but I feel compelled to remark that such utterances as
yours, Sir RICHARD, would be repudiated with horror by the
most unmitigated fiend that ever—”
Ere he could conclude the sentence, Sir RICHARD, with a
stifled imprecation, felled him to earth.
“I do not intend to hit you back again,” said the high-
minded nobleman, as he lay prostrate on the priceless
Kidderminster carpet. “I shall take it lying down, and,
while lying down, I shall be thinking out how I can but do
you a turn '''
sentences are founded on a leader in “The Daily Paper,”
they ought to be all right. Now we come to business. First
item on my list is a cable stating that “a mobile column has
just started to intercept the Somali Mullah, who has declined
to come to terms.”] -
At the same moment, in happy unconsciousness of the
unmerited indignity that was being endured by his revered
and noble parent, Major the Hon. GRANDison GoRDON, V.C.,
D.S.O., was superintending the departure of a column across
the trackless wilds of a West African desert.
“A gallant force,” he said to one of his subalterns; “but
shall we succeed in intercepting this Mullah? His strategic
genius and consummate . in evading pursuit are truly
phenomenal in a mere native' "
“They say, Sir,” said the sub, as he saluted respectfully,
“that the Johnny has European blood in him—that his
maternal ndfather, in fact, was a renegade Englishman.”
º said GRANDISON, with some surprise. “And
his name?—Heard you that?”
“I was told it, Sir, but it has escaped me—it was JASPER
something—ah, I remember now—JASPER CLUBBock.”
GRANDison recalled the name as that of a notorious great
uncle of Sir RICHARD's who, after doing his utmost to wreck
the fortunes of the House of Rockstone, had fled to the
Sahara two generations back, and was reported to have
embraced the Mohammedan faith. And so the family feud
was destined to be carried on, even in these remote regions !
There was something strangely sobering in the thought.
[Here’s a striking incident at a Christmas dinner to a
thousand aged poor which might be brought in somehow.]
But now we must transport the gentle reader back to a
vastly different scene. Never had the stately walls of the
Croydon Corn Exchange contained a happier, brighter
assemblage than the thousand old and deserving poor who
were being regaled beneath its historic roof upon a sumptuous
collation. Foremost as ever in all good works, like most
female members of the great house of Rockstone, the Hon.
GRISELDA GoRDON (don't know whether Lord GoRDON is a Baron
—but if not, perhaps Mr. STEAD will see that she gets her
proper title) was carrying plates of plum-pudding with her
own fair hands to the recipients, who seemed positively
overwhelmed by her condescension.
Noticing that tears were trickling down the furrowed
cheeks of an elderly individual who had just received a
second helping, GRISELDA gently inquired whether he was
dissatisfied with the amount.
“It is not that,” was the reply, “but I could not but
think of the contrast between my present position and the
happy days, now gone for ever, when I built a church at
Upper Clapton'."
“And to what,” asked the girl, “do you attribute the
change in your fortunes?”
“To what?” repeated the old man, as his eyes glowed
with sombre fire, “Why, to the diabolical cunning of that
double-dyed hypocrite and black-hearted scoundrel, URIAH
CLUBBock '''
Despite the warmth of the temperature in the hall, a cold
chill struck to GRISELDA's very heart as she heard the name.
Could she go nowhere without finding some fresh instance of
the sinister influence of these baleful CLUBBoCKs 2
[What fact shall I take next? Here's a case of shop-lifting
in the Police Reports—might involve a Miss SAPPHIRA CLUBBock
in it—perhaps hardly of sufficient interest, though. Let's see
if I can't combine two pars—one on the “high price of living
at Johannesburg,” the other on a “revival in the boot-trade.”
Think I see my way.]
Little did GRISELDA dream that, while she was engaged in
this philanthropic!employment, her favourite brother, the
Hon. GALAHAD GoRDON, was standing in the glaring main

And, with this intention, he entered a General Store of

he staggered out into the South African sunshine. “Eight-

human heart in his bosom can be capable of such extortion ?”
And then his eye fell on the bloated letters which glittered
udily above the shop-front, and he ceased to marvel. For
the name they spelt was Joshua CLUBBOCK! Was it mere
coincidence that had thus brought him in contact with a
member of the family to whom he never remembered hearing
his honoured father allude but in terms of the utmost loath-
ing and abhorrence? To distract his thoughts he drew from
his pocket a London paper, and as he read the tidings it
contained, his face shone with sudden joy. It told him that
the black cloud of depression which had so long overhung
the boot and shoe trade of his native Northampton (if Lord
GoRDON's family-seat is NOT at Northampton, perhaps Mr. S.

(lights not included), I possess a heavy accumulation of
note-books dealing with the marvellous exploits and super-
human career of the most phenomenal detective known to

forms from time to time for the benefit of the public which
has been good enough to interest itself in my beloved
but austere friend's immortal achievements. There will
be in the first place a series of ten volumes on “Holes as
a Man.” These will be followed after a short interval by
twenty of a similar size on the subject of “Holes in Relation
to the Creation of the World,” and the matter will be,
temporarily at least, concluded by the issue of twelve quarto
volumes entitled “Radium: is it Holes?” When I shall
have completed these I shall be able to contemplate with
satisfaction my humble share in the epoch-making events
has to be quite in the heart of it all! . . . Not so easy as I

which it is my duty to chronicle. I can promise the public
that in absorbing interest no less than in the virile graces
of a breezy literary style not one of these entrancing volumes
will fall short in any degree of the high standard which,
out of a regard for the imperishable memory of Holes, I
have consistently set for myself.
We were sitting one morning in the aforesaid lodgings,
little recking of the prodigious occurrences which were even
then impending over our heads. There had been a lull in
the criminality of the United Kingdom. . In fact, the steadily
decreasing average of murders and the almost complete
cessation of industry in the matter of burglaries and arsons
had been causing serious disquiet to the statesmen then
at the head of the government of the country. Frauds,
embezzlements and mysterious disappearances, to be sure,
had maintained themselves more or less at the accustomed
level, but even in this department, if you applied the test of
volume rather than of values, there were suspicious signs
which could not fail to produce uneasiness in the minds of
those who refused any longer to be hide-bound by the musty
shibboleths of the discredited Scotland Yard school of inves-
tigators. Holes, whose courage even in the midst of these
depressing circumstances had never flagged for a moment,
and whose serenity of temper and marvellous resourcefulness
had endeared him more than ever to the select circle of his
intimate friends, did not, of course, conceal from me the
extreme gravity of the outlook so far as the criminal
production of the country was concerned.
“Potson,” he used to say to me, “something will have to
be done. We cannot afford to rely for ever on our past.
What is the use of talking about GREENACRE, DICK TURPIN,
the MANNINGs, PALMER, SweeNEY ToD and THREE-FINGERED
JACK! They're dead, friend Potson, dead and gone, and
they’ve left no successors. France is creeping up to us–
the decennial averages prove it—Germany is even now
ahead of us, and America is dumping many of her best and
most highly finished criminals upon our markets. I ask
you, are we to take it lying down.”.” -
To such a question, I admit, I had no answer ready at the
moment, nor, had I possessed one, should I have ventured to
offer it, for Picklock Holes was a man not easily diverted
from any course on which he had set his heart, and I always
judged it better not to affront him needlessly when once I
saw that he had made up his mind. * *
Well, as I say, we were sitting in my rooms in Baker
Street. Holes had his steely eyes intently fixed on a coffee-
stain made by me on the table-cloth that morning, and from
certain curt interjectional remarks which had been falling
from his thin tightly-closed lips I gathered that he was
deducing from it by his own unsurpassable methods a
widely ramified and diabolical plot on the part of Russian
emissaries to assassinate the Mikado of JAPAN. Before, how-
ever, he had time to complete the steps of his process and to
bring the infamous crime home to the chief of the Russian
police, the door of our sitting-room was softly opened and a
young girl, tastefully dressed in a short skirt and an
ordinary shirt waist with hat to match, stepped, or, I should
rather say, sidled into the room. Casting a look full of
meaning at Hol.ES, she subsided into a chair and remained
silent, while Holes, upon whom her arrival had already
made a marked impression, half rose from his chair and
then resumed his former sitting posture.
“Mr. Holes,” she said at length in a voice of peculiar
sweetness, “do you know me?”
“You should not ask such a question, Miss,” I interrupted;
“Picklock Holes knows everybody.”
“Tush, Potson,” muttered Holes with some severity.
Then, turning to our visitor, he continued, “Proceed, Miss,
your melancholy story is not unknown to me.”
“In that case I need only tell you, since you know that
they are all deeply in love with me, that he ”—there was a
world of meaning in her utterance of the word—“ has
followed me hither, and is at this moment in Baker. Street.”
“Potson,” said Holes, drawing his chair closer to that
of the girl, who still kept her eyes riveted on his, “go
* and deal with this man as I would have him dealt
with.”
I obeyed, and having passed out through the front door
I found a thickly-built and ill-favoured ruffian whistling an
operatic air on our door-step. To accost him, to see that he
was a more powerful man than myself, to take him to the
nearest public-house, and to stand him a cold whisky—all
this was the work of a moment. When I returned to the
sitting-room Holes seemed visibly annoyed at my entrance,
and even more so at the account I gave of my doings.
“Oh, Potson, Potson,” he exclaimed, “will you never
learn? Forgive me, Miss, I must leave you for a moment.
Come, Potson, and see how the thing ought to be done.”
Then, having bowed politely to the young lady, he took me
with him out of the room.
The burly ruffian was no longer on the door-step, but a
rapid deductive calculation and a look up the street revealed
him to us about a hundred yards away. HoLEs was after
him in a moment. In the brisk fight that ensued the girl's
rsecutor was severely mauled, while the only damage
inflicted on Holes was that a random blow of his opponent's
managed to entirely and without redemption split one of my
austere friend's best infinitives. We then returned to our
home. Alas, the young lady was gone, gone like a beautiful
dream–and so were all my best silver spoons, the tea-pot
presented to me by the Imaum of KASHMIR, and a massive
silver-gilt epergne once the property of GALEN, and much
valued by me on that account.

Calnı. -
“The poor PRINCEss,” he said, “is now in safety, Heaven
help her. Hers has been a terrible story. Forgive me,
Potson, but it had to be.” -
“Holes,” I murmured reverentially, “you were never
greater and more generous than you are at this moment.”
THE FATAL MOUSTACHE.
II.
I well recollect my next meeting with MAUDE. It was a
Saturday evening, and I fixed the moustache on while waiting
on the steps of the house. The servant stared rudely when
she opened the door. I was shown into the drawing-room
as usual. They were all there, Mrs. SEVIER and MAUDE,
and Flo and EFFIE. Mrs. SEVIER at first did not recognise
me, though she But up her lorgnettes, but MAUDE said at
once, “Why, it's CYRIL with a moustache. What an improve-
ment!” and the others echoed, “Why, yes, what an
improvement l” . Then, before I could explain, MAUDE rushed
me into the little study, and I had never known her so
affectionate before. She told me I could have no idea how
pleased she was that I had made a little sacrifice for her: she
knew that I myself did not want to grow the moustache, but
that I had done it for her sake. She declared that it had
entirely changed me, and that she loved me more than she
had ever loved me before. No one now, she said, could
call me ugly. (So they had Master Bob, I doubt not.)
“Luckily I have not sent out the photos yet,” she went on ;
“we must be done again,” and she took down the large
cabinet photo of myself from the mantelpiece, looked at it,
laughed at it, and threw it into the fire. “I really don't
know how I could have accepted you before,” she said.
“Why, even you must acknowledge that you were ugly
then,” and, without waiting for an answer, she kissed me,

-I
and declared she liked the way it tickled
immensely.
After that, what was I to do? The
way she was taking it was most dis-
concerting. It was so * different from
what I had imagined. It was weak of
me, but I felt I must not undeceive
her yet. I had not the heart to rob her
of an innocent pleasure. Besides, her
new mood was so pleasant. I would
wait a little.
So, from that day, to my shame—and
ultimate confusion—I began to lead a
double life. To the world at large I
was clean-shaven; to MAUDE I was
moustached. I need scarcely say that
to a man of my temperament—brought
up as I had been—the deception was
peculiarly painful. And, on the top of
that, there was the growing fear lest I
should be found out. The strain soon
began to tell on me, so that I wonder
my dear Mother did not notice it.
Once, actually, I met Mrs. SEVIER in
Oxford Street. I hurried by without
saying a word, and she did not recog-
nise me. In the evening I had the
mortification of hearing her tell MAUDE
that she had seen a man exactly like I
used to be, only with a nastier expres-
sion. This did not make things easier
for me. -
Every day I intended to tell MAUDE,
and every day I put it off to the next.
It was so difficult. She was so evidently
roud of me now—prouder than she
ad ever been. She seemed quite differ-
ent from what she used to be. I did not
care to interfere with her happiness.
Soon a date was fixed for the wedding,
and she had actually almost agreed to our
living with Mother, so that she (Mother)
could look after us both. She had
said anyhow we could try it for a
little. Meanwhile I had made up my
mind that I would tell her after the
wedding.
Then the end came—quite suddenly.
I had brought her a little present of
a piece of jewellery that evening. On
such occasions she was always especially
affectionate. She flung her arms round
my neck, and kissed me very, very
fondly. That must have loosened it.
Later in the evening—she was absurdly
childish at times—she began to turn the
ends up. I begged her to desist, for I
saw what it might lead to, but no, she
was obstinate. There may have been a
slight struggle. Anyhow, suddenly my
mouth felt cold, and the moustache came
away in her hand. With a little shriek
she let it fall. We both watched the
thing as with cruel slowness it flickered
to the ground.
I do not F.” to reproduce the
scene that followed. I am ashamed to
say that MAUDE forgot herself.

“PENNY CIGAR, AN' A PENNY 'EADACHE Powder 1"
THE M.C.C. JOURNALISTS IN
AUSTRALIA.
ſ" A. peculiarity of the present English
cricketing combination on tour in Australia is
the number of its members who are also acting
as Press correspondents. Fully half of the
team appear to be ‘supplementing their
incomes’ in this fashion.”—Daily Chronicle,
Jan. 7, 1904.]
MR. WARNER's merry men occasionally
refresh themselves with a game of
cricket—indeed, on two separate occa-
sions, they met and defeated a repre-
sentative Australian eleven—but such
frivolities are not allowed to interfere
with their proper Journalistic labours.
Probably no stronger team of ready
writers has ever visited antipodean
shores, and there is not a man among
them who is not in form. WARNER's
skill with the pen has always been
extraordinary. H. up and down strokes
are alike brilliant, and he dips into the
ink with amazing rapidity. BoSANQUET

has a marked tendency to euphuism—
perhaps hereditary.
A few specimens of the team's recent
work, describing one of their digressions
into the cricket field, all culled from
current issues of their respective jour-
nals, may be interesting:—
Mr. WARNER, writing in the West-
minster Gazette, says that FIELDER's
treatment of the Bendigo boys was
He showed himself
more than ever a “sterling bowler.”
Mr. BosanquET, writing in the St.
James's Gazette, refers to HAYwaRD's
Bendigo innings as a “tip-topper.” “It
is doubtful,” . adds, º a better in-
nº. was ever played.”
r. FostER, writing in the Jermyn
Street Gazette, deprecates praise of his
own great innings. All the while, he
says, he was “longing to get back to
his desk and telegraph forms.”
LILLEY, writing in the Warwickshire
Clarion, joins in the chorus of eulogy
of Mr. FostFR's innings. “It was
great,” are his graphic words.
KNIGHT, in an interesting letter to the
Leicester Lymac, remarks on the climate
of Australia. It is, he says, “hotter
than home for the most part, but some-
times not so hot.”
HAYWARD, writing to the Oval Oracle,
speaks enthusiastically of Mr. WARNER's
captaincy. “A little bit of all right,”
he calls it, in a vivid phrase.
ARNOLD, who acts as correspondent
of the Worcester Sauce-bottle, is struck
by the likeness of the Australian men
and women to those of his own country.
“They are unmistakably of the old
stock,” he writes.
RHODEs has a similar comment in the
Bramall-Lane Advertiser. He also speaks
of Mr. FostFR's great innings as “im-
mense.”
RELF, writing in Sussea; Snippets,
paints the rigours of the voyage with
much feeling. “We were all in the
pavilion most of the time,” he says.
“They had forgotten to put the heavy
roller over the sea.” - --
TYLDESLEY, in the Old Trafford Times,.
Foster's great innings.
“Three or four other innings like it,”
he writes, “and the other side would
have had less of a look-in than they
had.”
STRUDwick, writing in W.G.'s Weekly,
points out that the grass on Australian
pitches might be growing in England, I
“so little difference is there in the colour
and size of the blades.”
From these extracts it will be seen
that, whether or not the M.C.C. team
brings back the “ashes,” English jour-
nalism is gaining some valuable and
industrious recruits.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
--------------
EMOLLIENTS FOR MILLIONAIRES.
AMERICAN STYLE.
II.
THE scene is a small room in Mr.
PoWTIUs WATTLE's slightly palatial dwell-
ing. On the table a few books,
arranged with resolute carelessness. A
bulbous portrait of Mr. WATTLE, who is
pointing with demonstrative forefinger
to the blue-print of a mine, hangs over
the fireplace. BUFFIN throws open the
door and announces to the empty room,
“Mr. MARCEL Torlisk.” Mr. Torlisk
enters as unconsciously as if surrounded
by a hundred eyes, of whose gaze a
high self-respect bade him seem unaware.
He walks straight to the table, takes up
a book, and on seeing the author's name
uts it down with a restrained yelp.
e stands before the fire and takes out
his watch. Mr. WATTLE appears in the
doorway and looks inquiringly at Mr.
ToRLISK.
Mr. Wattle. Have a chair, young man.
What can I do for you to-day?
Mr. Torlisk. Nothing for me, nothing
for me, Mr. WATTLE. It is I who minis-
ter to you. I come from Mrs. CAY.
Mr. W. O, to be sure. And what
may your line be? I've seen so many
of you fellows, I'm getting rather
mixed.
Mr. T. At the request of Mrs. CAY
I have come to talk to you for five or
| ten minutes about pictures, in which
your house does not seem to abound.
Mr. W. Fire away, young man.
Mr. T. You wish to buy a few paint-
ings, I believe?
Mr. W. Sure! -
Mr. T. Ah! . . . Well, the usual thing
—and Iemploy this expression in neither
an eulogistic nor a dyslogistic sense—
| the usual thing for an American million-
aire is to be guilty of Schreyerei.
Mr. W. Steady, there. Let's have
your notions without the tinfoil.
Mr. T. I mean, to buy a painting by
Schrey ER.
Mr. W. Yes, I've heard he does have
the call.
Mr. T. And then a picture by MoRET.
Now, don't misunderstand me. I'm
not classing SCHREYER and Monet together
—not for a minute. Tired as I am of
the ordinary stereotyped Monet, I yield
to none in my admiration for parts of
his work. For example, take some
among his paintings of London fog,
| masterpieces little known and less ap-
preciated. If you have set your heart
on one of these, I shan't say no.
Mr. W. (with resignation). No, I guess
you'd say a lot more than that.
Mr. T. Pardon” . . . As I was saying,

your Schreyer, have even your Ziem,

Here Mr. Tomlisk, breaking off, looks
upon Mr. WATTLE, and smiles as one who
would make his face subtly suggestive
of great things.
Mr. T. Mr. WATTLE, have you ever
considered the ground-floor aspect of
art 2
Mr. WATTLE gazes dejectedly about
the room, as if faintly hoping to find an
answer to the puzzle.
Mr. T. Have you ever thought of the
fascination, the honour, the glory of
dealing in aesthetic futures? ... You
see I adapt my language to your under-
standing ... Do I, may I, hope you find
my mysterious excitement a little–0, si

Mr. W. (after he has spat accurately
into the fire). Young man, I don't catch
your drift.
Mr. T. Be careful what you say!

years ago a young man named CLAUDE

Let us pass on . . . And in those days a
connoisseur, one skilled to know beauty
of MoMET and of MoxET's friends. He
bought those pictures cheap, he kept
them long, he sold them—those he
cared to sell–high, very high. Mr.
WATTLE, Mr. WATTLE, you can, if you
will, imitate that man and gain his
fame.
Mr. W. Well, you find a Monet cheap
and I'll buy it. Cheapness no bar.

are in the world, at this moment,

who will be before a great while, as any.

My dear Sir, I take umbrage at that.
Mr. W. Well, I don't know, after all.
I'm not sure as I'd mind giving our
boys a show. And there'd be no duty
to pay on their stuff.
Mr. T. Really? Your unconvention-
ality will carry §. to such lengths?
For years, Mr. WATTLE, I've been in
search of a millionaire like you. Why,
I'll make you immortal! -
Mr. W. Humph! I reckon I could
name a certain gold mine that's done
that already.
Mr. WATTLE moves his cigar along his
mouth, without the aid of his hands,
from corner to corner.
Mr. W. Young man, when you began
to talk I wondered why Mrs. CAY sent
such queer cattle here. But you're not
so bad. Your idea is to have me buy
some things by these fellows and then
sit on my purchase?
Mr. T. essentials, yes, that is my
suggestion.
Mr. W. And in twenty years I'm to
be known as a patron of art?
Mr. T. As one of our foremost patrons
of art, Mr. WATTLE.
Mr. W. Very good. I'll think it
over. Meanwhile, I'll take an instal-
ment of my reputation. Go and buy me
something that's not too far ahead of
the push. Sorry to have you leave.

AZURE PROSPECTS.
--
A self-styled “chromoscopist” fore-
tells that 1904 will be a blue year (as if
1903 wasn't blue enough 1) At least,
the colours of success will be the dee
blue tones, such as royal blue .
cornflower blue, without going into the
lighter or the darker shades. . Mr.
Punch's Own Obscurantist has there-
fore prepared the following forecast,
month by month:—
January. —If the thermometer is
below freezing-point, noses, and also
fingers, will be blue. A blue-blooded
aristocrat will gain the hand of a rich
American heiress.
February. —Blue-eyed young ladies
will receive much attention about the
middle of this month from susceptible
bachelors, spring poets, artists and
others. Dairymen will reap some tem-
porary advantage from the sale of sky-
blue milk.
March-Some stir may be expected
in political circles, and true-blue Con-
servatives, who are anxious to make u
their minds on the Fiscal Question, wi
be deeply, immersed in, Blue Books.
Cheese will be exceptionally blue at this
juncture. The Boat Race will result in
URGENTLY INVITED TO THE PLATFORM BY LORD ROSEBERY.

[“..It would be more use to the cause of Free Trade, if those who remembered those days,
however old they may be, or however unaccustomed to public speaking—if they were to appear
on the platform and say in a few pathetic words, as they would do, what they remember P.

a victory for one of the contestants,
though subsequent encounters this year
between the rival Blues will probably
end in draws, neither the light nor the
dark shades portending success.
April.-Will be remarkable for the
º of blue sky between the
showers. Christ's Hospital boys will
wear their accustomed uniform, and the
same prediction holds good of the Royal
Horse Guards, policemen, and members
of His Majesty's Navy.
May.—Bluebells may be looked for in
almost all the wooded parts of the
country. Many blue tits also will be
observed throughout the length and
breadth of the land, engaged in nesting
operations.
June. — A large, consumption by
washerwomenofa well-known commodity
may safely be relied upon during this
month. Šº engagements are in
rospect for the various Blue Hungarian
ands in London and elsewhere.
July.—Will be a good season for blue
butterflies. Many blue-bottles will
delight the householder with their merry
buzz and friendly little ways.
August.—The sea, with the kind co-
operation of the Clerk of the Weather,
will be of a deep blue colour in parts.
Peacocks' tails will exhibit the same
phenomenon. -
September.—A large number of holi-
day-makers will “blue” their money on
the Continent, and persons of linguistic
ability will return with their vocabulary
enriched by such expressions as
“Parbleu,” “Ventrebleu !” and the
like. The air will thus be blue on
occasion.
October.—Will mark the reassembling
of “blue-stockings” at the respective
ladies' colleges. Teetotallers will be

in the coat-lapel.
November.—Turquoises may now be
worn with success by the wives of the
well-to-do who possess these jewels.
Much blue china will be in evidence in
the cabinets of connoisseurs of this
article. Many blue devils will arise
from the London fog.
December.-The favourite pantomime
will be Bluebeard. The "Christmas
festivities will be fitly terminated by
doses of the familiar blue pill. Pros-
pects will be blue, as usual.

MR. PUNCH'S SYMPOSIA.
VIII.--Do we EAt Too MUCH 2
PRESENT.
Mr. John Trundley of Peckham (in
the chair.)
Mrs. Earle.
Sir Henry Thompson.
Mr. Fort num.
M. Benoist.
Mr. Bernard Shaw.
Sir Lewis Morris.
Dr. Farquharson, M.P.
Prof. Ray Lankester.
Rev. J. M. Bacon.
Mr. John Trundley (in the chair.)
Speaking ea cathedrá, as one would
say, and not in my official capacity as
the Fat Boy of Peckham with a desire
to make your flesh creep, I must say
that this is a question that cannot be
too much discussed. Do we or do we
not over-eat 2 Now—
Mr. Bernard Shaw. There is to the
intelligent man only one answer. Of
course we do. That is to say, of course
every one else does. England over-eats
steadily, day and night. Hence the
absence of super men and super women,
super girls and super boys.
Mr. John Trundley. O Mr. Shaw,
type of true gluttony kept under'
Surely there is present one super boy.
How much superer would you have
me? You should see my arm-chair at
home.
Mr. Bernard Shaw. Not super boy but
super-fatted boy. You should try pro-
tein biscuits and hard thinking.
Mr. Fortnum. A propos of hard think-
ing, my friend MASON asked me an
excellent riddle this morning. What is
º "ºr,
ir Henry Thompson. A dinner
regaled only on protein biscuits J.
not, Iventure to think, be an exhilarating
function. Over-eating may be bad, but
in my belief it is not so harmful as
over-heating.
Rev. J. M. Bacon. I quite agree.
Closed windows are the dickens. I keep
my balloon most carefully ventilated.
And this reminds me that to the balloon-
ist a large meal can sometimes be of the
greatest service. The other day, for
example, I wished to descend in a hurry
from one of my flights, but found that
the escape valve would not work. There
was nothing for it but to eat a huge
lunch and so weight myself that I acted
as the required extra ballast and caused
the balloon to alight gracefully in the
middle of the Round Pond.
Sir Lewis Morris. But surely—
M. Benoist. The story is true, I assure
ou, gentlemen. I myself supplied the
intrepid aeronaut with the collation.
Dr. Farquharson. Over-eating is not
to be universally condemned. The
physical deterioration to which I have
recently drawn attention in the Times
is largely due to an insufficient dietary.
I am all for a free breakfast table, but
I would not pamper the proletariat
with plovers' eggs, or furnish recruits
with a messing iº to squander it
on caviare, whatever their General might
eat.
Sir Lewis Morris. Food should not
merely be attuned to the environment,
but to the character of the mental effort.
For lyric flights I recommend ortolans,
for the heroic couplet brandy and
porterhouse steaks.
Mrs. Earle. Variety should be the
note of an enlightened diet; not neces-
sarily abstinence from flesh foods. Milk
is essential; nightcaps of milk from the
cocoanut are now in fashion amongst
the best people.
Sir Lewis Morris. Speaking as the
Hades of an epicure, i". insist
on the necessity of making diet har-
monise with environment. When
during the composition of my magnum
opus I lived on the Underground, I
subsisted entirely on , truffles, tubers,
and other roots, washed down with
subcutaneous injections of coal tar.
Mr. Fortnum. Returning to my friend
MASON's riddle, What is the difference,
he asked, between—
Sir Henry Thompson. Over-eating is of
course a relative term. What is over-
eating in one man might be a very
moderate and even unsatisfying perform-
ance in another. Look at GARGANTUA.
M. Benoist. Ah, my brave country-
man
Prof. Ray Lankester. The truth of
Sir HENRY THOMPsox's shrewd remark
may be proved in a moment by a visit
to the Zoological Society's Gardens in
Regent's Park. For example, the modest
meal of a quarter of a sheep which
leaves a lion still unappeased would be
gross over-eating in the marmoset, while
what might be a frugal repast to the
marmoset would doubtless prove a sur-
feit to the ladybird or the anopheles
mosquito.
Sir Lewis Morris. As I remark in my
Songs without Music:-
“Proud man secluded in his petty corner
May learn most useful lessons from the
fauna.”
Mr. Bernard Shaw. If the Zoo were
strictly vegetarian, as it ought to be, the
lions would be super lions.
Prof. Ray Lankester. I ought to ex-
plain, however, that the animal analogy
is decidedly to the credit of man as a
moderate feeder. Thus my distin-
guished friend Mr. J. Holt Schooling
has computed that, if we took our food
in the shape as well as in the quantity
of that consumed by the ordinary robin,
a full-grown adult would be entitled to
eat daily a sausage thirty-two feet long
and three inches in diameter.
Mr. Fortnum. Exactly. What is the
difference, my friend MASON said, between
a Cambridge sausage—
Sir Lewis Morris. That reminds me
of a little valentine in verse that I once
sent to Sir THOMAS LIPTON. It began:
“Pray tell me, genial Squire of Osidge,
Why is there not an Oxford sausage?”
Sir Henry Thompson. My belief is
that if one eats nothing between meals
one may eat anything at them. It is
the pernicious habit of indulging in
snacks that saps the constitution.
Mr. John Trundley. I cannot agree.
Growing boys should never go without
food for more than three hours. Besides,
I am told that the smart set eat meat
five times a day—at breakfast, lunch,
afternoon tea, dinner and supper.
Mr. Bernard Shaw. Society is full of
supper men.
Sir Lewis Morris. Master TRUNDLEY is
perfectly right. As I remark in my
Songs from the Underground:
Yet his voracity was such
As I too must deplore;
For he could never eat so much
That he could eat no more.
At Chatsworth the other day
Mr. Bernard Shaw. If the aristocracy
ceased to be carnivorous, it would no
longer be available for obloquy. Per-
sonally I should be inclined to make
vegetarianism a penal offence for Peers.
Dr. Farquharson. And, I should add,
for raw recruits. It is, I believe,
impossible for a vegetarian to over-eat
himself, and our “Brodricks’ must be
over- not under-fed.
Mrs. Earle. I believe that on three
º: of pot pourri a British soldier
could go anywhere and do anything.
Sir Henry Thompson. When I was
writing Charley Kingston's Aunt, I lived
almost entirely on seakale, widgeon, and
raspberry vinegar.
Mr. Bernard Shaw. If I had written
ºv. Aunt, it would not be running
still.
Mr. Fortnum. What is the difference,
my friend MASON said, between—
Mr. John Trundley. Having to put in
a compulsory appearance very shortly at
the Peckham Board School, I must vacate
the chair; which, I may remark as I go,
is the first chair in a strange house that
I have not broken.
Prof. Ray Lankester. Before the
meeting dissolves, I should like to point
out that this cry about over-eating is
no new thing. In my researches into
the palaeolithic age I have discovered
traces of appalling repletion in mastodons
and mammoths, while the last of the
dodos was obviously an insatiable
devourer of light literature, and, so far
as I have been able to ascertain, was
ultimately choked by one of Mr. BENSoN's
novels.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HUMPTY DUMPTY AND HIS YOLK-FELLOWS
AT DRURY LANE.
YEAR after year and still the wonder grows that ancient
monarch Pantomime in his palace at Drury Lane should yet
be king of our hearts for any number of nights and
matinées at close of the old and opening of the New Year,
and that the present pantomimic policy of his most liberal
Conservative Ministry, as directed by the powerful Premier
ARTHUR Collins (HICKORY Wood having a seat in the
prompter's box), should have already achieved such success
as will render secure the dynasty of Pantomime for many
years to come on the throne it has so long and, as a rule to
which the exceptions are rare, so brilliantly adorned. Vivat
Rez Pantomimus' may his limelight never be less, and may
his Chancellor of the £º: secure a splendid surplus!
The excellent monarch deserves it: ARTHURUs DRURIOLANUs
deserves it: and the members of his stringed and winded
band, including JACOBUS HANDANGLovERIUs, the conductor
thereof, deserve it. Certainly, judging from the enthusiastic
applause dealt out with no j. hands to all the
striking combinations and kaleidoscopic permutations of
groupings, to the vivid solutions and resolutions (no con-
nection with those “good” ones that are the subject of an
unpleasant proverb) of colour, to the ever varying lights, and
to all the graceful—and, it may be added, substantial—forms,
whose movements are as dazzling to the eye as is the per-
petual motion in a microscopic quintessence of radium, we
are bound to conclude that the popularity of this present
show is placed beyond the limits of speculation, and
that Humpty Dumpty of 1903–1904 will be memorable as
a magnificent and exquisitely-artistic display fairly beating
the record, even in the brilliant annals of Drury Lane
pantomime.
And for its fun and humour? Ah! that is another
question. And the answer? We speak of a pantomime as
we find the audience, and it is but strict justice to testify
that all the youngsters, whose presence was strongly in
evidence on the occasion of our visit, boys and girls
ranging from early ten up to mature sixteen, were evidently
enjoying it thoroughly, shrieking with laughter at the
comicalities of DAN LENO (whose return is so welcome to
all of us) as Queen Spritely, of HARRY RANDALL as Little Mary
(the elders growl, sotto voce, “Hang Little MARY | *—the not
particularly brilliant jape is played out ad nauseam), of
that eminent all-round droll, Mr. flºº CAMPBELL, as King
Sollumm, and revelling in the drolleries of Mr. BAstow as a
sort of over-grown shockheaded Peter (his popularity being
as great a puzzle to us as was the plot of the pantomime),
while as The Scarecrow Mr. Hugh J. WARD plays a part
which, although clearly originating with Phroso (once of
the Hippodrome), is as originally humorous in conception
as it is in this actor's dramatically comic rendering of it.
Methinks, or, as we are employing the editorial first person
plural, usthinks, that if all ºf allusions were banished
from Pantomime, our boys and girls would not miss the
omission, while the middle-aged and elderly of both sexes
would gladly welcome a neutral ground. Let “Fiscal
Policy” yield to a “Frisk-all Policy” in Pantomime, and
au diable with every JoE, except of course that chartered
libertine the Clown, sustaining the ancient “JoEY” GRIMALDI
tradition. “Honours” in political hits are fairly divided
at Drury Lane, as if King CAMPBELL sings a song in praise
of “Our JoE,” on the other hand The Scarecrow puts a glass
in his eye, and, with an orchid in his buttonhole and a big
and little loaf in his hands, staggers about, stumbles, and
collapses against the proscenium amid roars of laughter.
Miss MARIE GEORGE renews her conquests over all hearts as
the sweet little Blossom, a part not so fascinating as her
little Dutchess of last year. A handsome, dashing and

Jove, AND I've CAUGHT THE WoRM Too!”
sprightly pair of steppers are Miss Louise WiLLs and Miss
RUTH Lytton as Humpty Dumpty and Rudolph respectively.
Miss ETHELNEGRETTi (“and when we called ‘NEGRETTi, ZAMBRA
came "—where was ZAMBRA”) was the embodiment, a very
handsome embodiment too, of the Spirit of Mirth; and
Madame GRIGoLATI as “Undine" flies about—(rather a
novelty this for Undine, except that she may be considered
as a flying-fish fairy who can also swim like the little duck
she § and, adopting a new submarine line of action with
striking-out effect, leads a shoal of glittering GRIGoLATIs, all
as graceful and wonderful as ever.
he scenes by our artistic friends BRUCE SMITH, McCLEERY,
two CANEYs, Messrs. Johnstone and HARFORD and HENRY EMDEN,
are as perfect as their collective and individual talent can
make them.
The tableaux are magnificent: the jeu de scène through-
out, admirably ordered by Field-Marshal MooRE; and ARTY
CoLLINs is to be 'artily congratulated on the highly
efficient work done for the pantomime by his chief costume-
house officer CoMELLI.
We noticed that in the bill a “Harlequinade” was
announced, but as the Clown, “Whimsical WALKER,”
CHARLEs Ross as Pantaloon, Toyſ CUSDEN for Harlequin and
RoSE Rowe for Columbine, could not have got their chance
until quite 11:30, we hereby present the joyous quartette
with our compliments the most distinguished, and regret
that we, being early risers (like the GRIGoLATIs), were unable
to stay and see them either at “The Stores” or on “The
Housetops,” which two scenes constitute the harlequinade.
Our loss. “So long !” Alas, poor JoEY!

A BLANK–BLANK-DAY!
PROVERBIAL PHILOSOPHY
FROM THE TUBE.
LAst in the lift, first out.
The worst draught comes just before
the train.
It's a wise traveller that knows at
which end is the “Way Out.”
He who keeps his ticket is lost.
A train at hand is worth twenty at
Shepherd's Bush.
OPENING AN OLD Wol:ND. —It was
hoped that the fierce conflicts which in
1900 raged around the question of the
actual birthday of the New Century
had been finally closed. It has been
left, however, for the Devon Evening
Express to fling a fresh apple of discord
into our midst. “Few centuries,” says
that pessimistic organ, “ have had a
more ominous commencement than
1904.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
It was with fear and trembling my Baronite opened a new
book by the author of Timothy's Quest. The most dangerous
enemies of a successful writer are those of his own household.
Once a hit has been made, the public, having fresh dishes
set before them by the same author, ever hark back to their
first love, murmuring that the hand has lost its cunning.
That is a charge that will not lie against Mistress KATE
DocGLAs Wiggin in respect of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm
(GAY AND BIRD). KATE Douglas does not owe her inspirations
to WoRDsworth. But in her delineation of Rebecca she
realises the poet's idea:
A dancing Shape, an Image gay,
To haunt, to startle, and waylay.
Child or girl, Rebecca is just delightful. Perhaps the
girlhood scenes are more attractive as giving fuller oppor-
tunity for her freshness. The scene is set in one of those
ancient, remote American villages, where, doubtless, KATE
Dougi. As herself once lived. She peoples its street, its
environing wood, its homes and its schoolhouse with quaint
but human people. All are good. Aunt Mirandy, with her
sharp-tongued and acid manner; simple Aunt Jane, with
memories of her lost love; hopeless, harassed Mrs. Simpson,
with her seven children and food enough for three; pere
Simpson with his penchant for swapping portable articles
that don't belong to him, a habit that leads to absences from
home varying from two to six months according to the view
the magistrate takes of the circumstances; and, above all,
Mr. Cobb, driver of the stage-coach from Maplewood to
Riverboro. The opening chapter, relating the conversation
between Mr. Cobb and Rebecca, as he conveys her in his cart
to Aunt Mirandy's, is, in its subtle humour and simple pathos,
equal to any parallel passage in DickeNs. Rebecca is
thoroughly refreshing.
Any book by the author of Bootle's Baby commands the
Baron's instant attention, and, such being the case, it is with
pleasure he is able to announce that Sly Boots, by “John
STRANGE WINTER" (John LoNg), contains some of the best short
stories, and at all events one of the most laughable, (yclept
“Sly Boots,” which gives its title to the volume.) that
Mrs. ST-NN-RD (thus the Baron lets out three-fourths of the
author's secret) has ever given to her admiring public.
On a memorable occasion Mr. Weller observed a tea-
drinking young 'ooman “a-swellin' wisibly before his wery
eyes.” Baronite notes the same phenomenon occurring
in Who's Who (A. & C. BLACK). This notwithstanding that
there have been sliced off the original corporate body the
useful Tables that formerly occupied the first part of the
volume. They are issued as a separate book, called Who's
Who Year Book. The older volume is now confined to cata-
loguing the names and addresses of the principal persons in
the kingdom, with brief biographical notes. The volume
runs to seventeen, hundred closely-printed pages. At the
moderate computation of eight a page, this gives particulars

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 20, 1904.
FRAGMENT OF AN EPIC OF THE UNDERGROUND.
[A humble admirer and imitator of the author of the Epic of Hades,
having had his attention called to certain recent confessions of the
Statesman-Poet, in which he admitted that he had composed portions
of that masterpiece on the Underground Railway, has attempted to
follow his example, with the deplorable results set forth below.
So from beneath the tower
Of that great Senate House, which he erewhile,
The pride of Wales, Sir LEwis MoRRIs, Bard,
Proposed to enter, on the Liberal plank,
But changed his dreadful purpose and was made
A knight for guerdon, lo! I passed within
The darkling gloom of Westminster Bridge Station,
Having the frenzy on me. Here, methought,
Where more than elsewhere on the District Rail
Mephitic vapours counterfeit the clime
Of Hades, I shall find the atmosphere
Suited to Orpheus and Eurydice,
My topic for the day. The ticket man
Handed me, by request, a third return
To Gloucester Road, for which I paid the fee
Marked legibly thereon. Adown the stairs
Two at a time with winged feet I swept,
And caught a London and North-Western train
Such as connects with Hyperborean lines
At Willesden Junction.
Partly for the sake
Of inspiration sucked from deadlier fumes,
And partly in the certain hope to mix
With female passengers, some one of whom
Might serve as model for Eurydice,
I chose a smoking carriage. In the hurry
My choice was careless, and I chanced to light
On a compartment of superior class,
Whose occupants numerically touched
The Muses' level, five upon the left,
Four on the right hand, women every one,
Myself the submerged tenth. Straight I surmised
That from some meeting at the Mansion House
They were returning, since their talk was loud
Of petticoats designed for heathen hips,
But nowise reminiscent of the Nine
Pierides.
Finding it in the way,
I slung my lyre upon the rack reserved
For light impedimenta, where it made
AEolian music, owing to the draught.
But scarce, in these distracting circumstances,
Had I composed beyond a score of lines
Broadly embodying the nymph's regrets,
Like this:—“Excuse me, dear, that I forgot
That silly rule about the backward glance
And thus upset our mutual apple-cart”---
And so forth–ere we reach the ensuing station,
St. James's Park, where passengers alight
For that depressing block of buildings named
From our Queen ANNE, deceased. And lo! the door
Yawned to admit a mother and her babe.
And all the latent manhood in me rose
To give them place; which they at once accepted.
So, wedged between opposing knees I stood
Until the shock of starting flung me prone
Across a picture hat; whereon the babe
Let loose an instant peal of pure delight.
But I, recovering all my feet, stood up
And mused again of Hell.
Yet not so soon
Could that elusive rapture be re-caught;
And I admit that I had barely framed
Some further dozen lines when a great voice
That cried “Victorial Victorial ''
Brought back to me the Master's Jubilee Ode.
And, while that memory thrilled me through and
through, -
A second jerk, caused this time by the brake,
Projected me, as from a catapult,
On an adjoining lap.
A second spasm
Convulsed the babe. But even as I rose,
Breathing inspired apologies, the door
Opened, and an inspector entered in
And asked to see my ticket. Not Actaeon,
When the sleuth-hounds fell on him where he watched
Diana's mysteries from behind a tree,
Felt such a poignant shame as I, being found
A lonely male, and in an attitude
Not all uncompromising, as it seemed,
And made to pay the difference between
Second and third-class fare.
This done, anon,
I clutching at the rack wherein my lyre
Still fitfully discoursed Æolian airs,
The train proceeded . . . .

Author. If you insist. But you must bear the responsibility.
Editor. With pleasure.]

MR. PUNCH'S SPECTRAL ANALYSES.
XI.--THE THIN END OF THE WEDGE.
“I BEG you,” said the Headless Man with some agitation,
“not to dream of doing such a thing. Of course, if you
think that I am unequal to the work—” he added rather
stiffly.
“My dear Sir,” I replied, “not at all. Not at all. What
a notion I am sure there is not a spectre on the list who
could do it half so well, and what the Haunted Mill would
be without you I don't care to thirk.”
“Then why wish to employ another ghost?”
“I thought you would like a companion. It must be lonely
for you here when I am away.”
“I miss you, of course, as who would not?” replied the
Headless Man in his charming way. “But I prefer solitude
to the company of another ghost. Take my advice, Mr.
WUDDUs. Dismiss the idea of increasing your establishment.”
The trouble was this. My old friend Lord SANGAzure,
finding it necessary, owing to the expenses connected with
the marriage of his eldest daughter, to retrench, had resolved
to dismiss one of his staff of spectres, a luminous boy of
excellent character and obliging disposition. Wishing to
procure him a comfortable home in exchange for the luxury
of Sangazure Towers he had written to me, suggesting that
I should enrol him as a member of my household. “You
must want a ghost,” he had said, having evidently forgotten
that I already employed a Headless Man.
I felt a delicacy in adding to my establishment without
the approval of the Headless Man, so I had told him of Lord
SANGAZURE's proposal, which, as I have shown, he had unhesi-
tatingly ..
“Dismiss the idea,” he said again. “I have a great respect
—and I may say liking—for you, Mr. WUDDUs" (here he
brushed away the not unmanly tear), “and I should not care
to see vou suffer the same fate as Mr. MoseNSTEIN.”
“What was that?” I inquired; “I don't think I ever
heard that story.”
“Ah, then I will tell it to you. You will find it extremely
relevant to the case in point. This Mr. MoseNSTEIN was a

“pig in clover,” who, by dint of rigging
the market, had risen from compara-
tively decent obscurity to the possession
of several millions of pounds. His first
act was to ensure himself a sufficiency
of congenial society by settling in Park
Lane, his second to look for a good house
in the country. He hit upon Blenkin-
sop Manor, the seat of Lord BLEN-
KINSOP, an amiable old gentleman who,
through a tendency on the part of his
sons to marry music-hall artistes instead
of American heiresses, had been reduced
to a genteel poverty. Lord BLENKINSOP
closed with his munificent offer, and
Mr. MoseNSTEIN took possession. . Of
course, as you will doubtless have fore-
seen, he had trouble from the outset
with the resident ghost. The latter, I
have heard, gave notice five times in
the first week, and it was only the en-
treaties of Mr. MoseNSTEIN, couched in
assionate Yiddish, and the tears of
Mrs. MoseNSTEIN, that induced him to
stop on and give them one more trial.
It was a fatal move on the part of the
new owner. The spectre became a
tyrant. He insisted on having a suite
of apartments reserved for him, dis-
missed several of the servants, ex-
amined every list of guests, and claimed
the right to veto those of whom he dis-
approved. In fact, Mosenstein Manor,
as it had been re-named, became a sort
of lodging-house—in which the Mose.N-
STEINs were the lodgers. It was only
the fear of losing their ghost that pre-
vented the newcomers from rebelling.
So things went on, until one day Mr.
MoseNSTEIN, retiring to his study for a
last cigar before going to bed, found
the best chair already occupied. The
occupant was a spectre. He was sitting
in front of the fire, reading the Spectral
News. He looked up as Mr. MoseNSTEIN
entered, but resumed his reading with-
out a word. The lord of the Manor
smoked his cigar in the billiard-room.
“‘A friend of mine,' explained the
resident ghost, on being questioned next
day. “He has come to stop for a few
days. I trust he does not intrude? If
so—’ He paused, and looked so much
as if he were going to give notice again
that Mr. MosessTEIN hastened to say that
he was charmed to put up any friend of
his, and hoped he would stop as long as
he liked. Kºi. I may say, he did.
He is still there. It was the thin edge
of the wedge. During the next fort-
night six other spectres arrived, and
each time Mr. MosexSTEIN was forced to
give in and assure them that they were
welcome. Soon there was quite a
spectral house - party at the Manor.
And it was not long before the human
occupants of the house began to feel
the pinch of the boot. §. Mosex-
STEIN was not allowed to go into his
study, because the ghost there hated

to be disturbed. He could not use the
billiard-room because two gentlemen
who had killed one another there in the
reign of HENRY THE SIXTH wanted the
table for their nightly three rounds
with the broadsword. All the best
bedrooms had to be given up, and even
the terrace was occupied. And, not
wishing to lose his original ghost, Mr.
MoseNSTEIN had to put up with it all.
To cut a long story short, when he
visits Mosenstein Manor now, he stays at
the Lodge; and I see in the Spectral
News this week that even that is about
to be taken—as a bijou residence for the
Countess of BLENKINSOP, who poisoned
herself there in the days of the Com-
monwealth. So now you see the danger
of having more than one ghost. One
spectre,” concluded the Headless Man,
sententiously, “is an indispensable
adjunct to domestic bliss. Two are a
nuisance. Half-a-dozen spell Misery.”
And, settling his head comfortably
under his arm, he vanished. I went down-
stairs, and wrote to Lord SANGAZURE
informing him—with regret — that I
had no vacancy.

Mr. Punch desires to contradict the
assertion, recently made in his pages,
that the performances of Parsifal at
Bayreuth are a source of financial profit
to Frau WAGNER. Frau WAGNER, he is

To her therefore he offers his best

[JANUARY 20, 1904.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S SYMPOSIA.
IX.-WHY ARE we so RUDE 2
SCENE -— The Saloon of the Turbine
Channel steamer. The French Coast
receding in the distance.
PRESENT:
Lord Avebury (in the Chair).
M. Paul Cambon.
Mr. J. E. C. Bodley.
Mr. Andrew Lang.
Mr. Hayden Coffin.
Mr. George Alexander.
Mr. H. B. Marriott Watson.
Ahmed Madralli (the Terrible Turk).
Mr. Charles Manners.
Lord Avebury. The exquisite hospi-
tality we have received during our stay
in France only brings home to us more
fully the sense of our own imperfections.
I propose that we devote the transit—
bereft of its horrors and converted into
one of the pleasures of life by the
triumph of science—to a discussion of
the question, “Why are we, as a nation,
so rude?” or, in other words, can we
become more polite?
Mr. Andrew Lang. Why should we?
Mr. J. E. C. Bodley. Only those who
have studied the French nation on the
spot, as I have, can realise the immense
gulf that exists between the manners of
France and the manners of England.
Even among the poorest, while, for
example, the street boy of London would
be advising you to get your hair cut, the
gamin of Paris is placing his coat, in a
puddle that you may keep your boots
clean.
Mr. Hayden Coffin. It was an English-
man, Sir WALTER RALEIGH, who taught
him that trick, anyway.
Mr. Bodley, No. I have the best
reason for believing that RALEIGH
acquired the pretty action from a French
polisher.
Mr. Marriott Watson. There is no
doubt that we lackmanners, particularly,
perhaps, when we travel. But what
can fyou expect when the hand that
ought to be rocking the cradle and
ruling the world is brandishing the
hockey-stick?
M. }. Cambon (the French Ambas-
sador). But why, if I may ask, alter
things at all? . The Englishman is
valued because he is an Englishman.
Why denationalise him in order to gain
a little unimportant urbanity?
Mr. Hayden Coffin. Not unimportant,
surely? ... An easy address, a pleasant
voice, and a gallant pose, are possessions
which every man should strive to
acquire, no matter how often he has to
visit The Country Girl to take lessons.
Mr. George Alexander. St. James has,
I venture to assert, as good manners as
St. Denys, and vastly better trousers.
Lord Avebury. The fact remains, I
fear, that Englishmen travelling abroad
too seldom take into consideration their
position as strangers in a hospitable
house. When in Rome, it used to be
said, one should do as the Romans do.
Similarly, when in Paris, if I may be
pardoned the somewhat audacious para-
phrase, one should do as the Parisians
do. For instance, we should make a
point of conforming to the unwritten
laws of dress that govern the Opera, and
not push to our seats in suits of dittoes.
Mr. George Alexander. Might it not
depend a little on how the dittoes were
cut and pressed ?
Lord Avebury. I fear not.
Mr. Marriott Watson. My contention
is that the fault primarily is with the
women. If our mothers are eternally in
the hockey field, how can we be properly
instructed in manners or anything else?
Mr. Bodley. I think the evil is more
deeply seated than my gifted confrère
seems to imagine. enerations back
French writers commented adversely on
the morgue Britannique.
Mr. Andrew Lang. Surely you don't
want to import the $º. Morgue?
Lord Avebury. I think it is generally
conceded that we have much to learn,
but the question is, from whom? For
my own part, speaking as a sedulous
apiarist, I think that we might take a
leaf or two from the book of the bee.
Nothing could be more courtly than the
obeisance with which they greet their
Queen. Loth as I am to indulge in a
play upon words, and even more loth to
mispronounce the king's English, I am
yet disposed to remark that if we wish
to learn how to beehive we must go to
the apiary.
Mr. Bodley. Or to France.
Lord Avebury. True. French man-
ners are charming. Many times as I
have visited that pleasant country, I
have never yet heard a Frenchman say
“Rats.” -
Mr. Andrew Lang. The decay of
manners is largely due to the corrupt-
ing influence of the New Humour, which
I regret to see even our Chairman has
not escaped.
Lord Avebury. But surely, Mr. LANG,
you would not deny the humanising
effect of letters, or repudiate your
brothers of the quill?
Mr. Andrew Lang. On the contrary,
I am always ready to fall on their necks
—with a hatchet.
Mr. Marriott Watson. There is nothing
wrong that I can see with men's man-
ners. It is women—and, above all,
American women—who are to blame.
Delenda est Chicago.
Mr. Hayden Coffin. I am not here to
defend the sex, but I cannot sit still and
listen to aspersions cast upon it. Manners,
they say, maketh man; but the proba-
bility is that women first made manners.
Mr. Bodley. The last gentleman has
spoken well. It has been said that the
first part of strength is its chivalry.
What does our strong man say?
Ahmed Madralli (the Terrible Turk).
I know nothing of the subject, but I am
prepared to wrestle with it.
Lord Avebury. The question before
the meeting is, Can we improve our
manners?
Mr. Charles Manners. On behalf of
myself, of my wife Madamo Moody
MANNERs, and of my cousin Mr. SANKEY
MANNERs, I would emphatically say No.
England has the best Manners—the
Manners it deserves—and all who visit
Drury Lane during the cheap opera
and lecture season next summer will
know that this is so.
Mr. Andrew Lang. Help! Help!
(Paralysis of the Company.)
CHARIVARIA.
THE Russo-Japanese imbroglio still
awaits settlement, but in the meantime
the difference between Mr. A. B.
WALKLEY and Mr. BourCHIER has been
adjusted.
A Port Arthur journal asks, “Would
it not be possible to form a Pan-
European Union in opposition to
the Pan-Asiatic combination? The
answer, dear Russia, is in the negative.
Still, no harm in asking, of course.
Of pathetic interest is the announce-
ment that the Fat Boy of Peckham's

is receiving a remarkable confirmation
at Drighlinton. The Messenger Boy at
the Post-office in that town is now
aged 82. -
To “get even" with his wife, with
whom he had quarrelled, a Northampton
boot-operative broke up his furniture
and set fire to his house. He carried
his revenge yet further last week by
getting sent to prison for a month.
A number of London clergymen have
announced their intention of preaching
Early Closing sermons. The #. Seems
admirable. The average sermon is far
too long.
An instance of a lady losing her
memory in a train was reported in the
papers last week. Such cases are not
uncommon. A short time ago a gentle-
man took from the rack a valuable
gold-fitted dressing bag, forgetting he
had not brought it with him.
We are informed by the official organ
of Emperor JACQUES I. that “before long

the flag of the Sahara will fly from the
Atlantic to the Red Sea,” but we are
not told who will be chasing it.
If war breaks out, the odium will rest,
with Japan. The CzAR will be blame-
less. He has begged the Japanese in
the sacred cause of Peace to give way to
him, but Japan has refused.
Ignorance of etiquette sometimes has
awkward results. It transpired at the
Middlesex Sessions that, when a police
officer takes a prisoner from one place
to another by train, it is the custom for
the police officer, on reaching his
destination, to alight first, and for the
prisoner to follow him. Owing to inex-
perience a first offender, in tº
circumstances, went out by the door on
the other side of the carriage, and it took
eighteen months to recapture him.
Four hundred and ninety-eight Boers ,
who had declined to accept the terms of
peace are now on their way back to
South Africa. Mr. DELAREY harangued
them for five hours at Ahmednagar, and
intimated that he would continue unless
they took the oath. They took the oath.
Blackbirds are said to be causing great
trouble to the farmers. A proposal that
policemen shall be placed at the most
dangerous spots is under consideration.
A Belgian savant has just published
a pamphlet drawing attention to the
extreme danger, from a sanitary ſpoint
of view, of the custom of shaking hands,
especially with such persons as surgeons,
nurses, hairdressers, sausage-makers,
and tripe-merchants. In the case of the
tripe-merchants it is even said to be
safer to kiss them.
“Joeite” writes to point out that a
huge business in skates is done in
Norway and Iceland, while the trade in
these articles in England is in a notori-
ously depressed state, and asks whether
it is not a fact that the countries he first
mentions enjoy Protection.
At the request of Mr. BALFour the
Canadian Minister for War recently
attended a meeting of our Committee
of Imperial Defence. We understand
that the Colonial Minister is now con-
vinced that we did right in not risking
a conflict with the United States over
the Alaskan difficulty.
M. Rodin, the new President of the

SIDELIGHTS FROM THE FRONT.
(From a Special Correspondent.)
THE situation looks like war. It looks so much like war
that they are often taken for each other.
It is almost impossible to over-estimate the gravity of
the situation. But I am doing my best.
A high official, who stands close to the CzAR, and does
not wish to stand any closer, made a significant observation
to me this evening. “We shall know more by and by,”
were his remarkable words. They are being widely quoted.
There is no news to-day. But by re-writing my despatches
of yesterday, taking care to transpose the words Tokio and
St. Petersburg, you will have a column of good, newsy matter
for the Halfpenny Headline.
Despatches from Rio de Janeiro, saying that the CzAR
and the Emperor of JAPAN are planning an Arctic voyage
together, are to be received with caution.
“Quis Custodiet, &c.?”—Under the accusing title “A
Judge and Drink,” the Cheltenham Chronicle states that
“Sir WILLIAM GRANTHAM has recovered from his indisposi-
tion.” The paragraph proceeds further, but few will have
the heart to read beyond this point.
DEFICIENT Logic.—“A Louvain Professor” is quoted by
The Tablet as having said of the late HERBERT SPENCER, “He
was not an original thinker, but he thought he was.”
Surely, is not SPENCER's own estimate of himself sufficient to
establish the fact of his having been “an original thinker?”

Mr. PARTON, secretary to Mr. PoWTIUS
WATTLE, is discovered at his desk,
staring at one of the letters he has iust
opened. Mr. WATTLE enters and surveys
Mr. PARTON with expectation.
Mr. W. Anything new to-day, PARTON?
P. Well, yes, Sir-rather! Biggest
thing yet.
Mr. W. Out with it, youngster. I
mean, you may proceed.
P. It's extraordinary. It's fabulous.
It's a letter—0, Sir, can such things
be?—a letter from Herr SCHWANGAU,
Secre to the Emperor WILLIAM. He
says: “His Majesty the German EMPEROR
commands me to say that if Mr. PostIUS
WATTLE is in Potsdam on Tuesday,
January 5, His Majesty will be happy
to entertain Mr. WATTLE at luncheon.”
Mr. W. PARTON, we grow glorious.
P. It would seem so, Sir.
Mr. W. PARTON, this is too good to
keep.
P. Your own honours you may be
excused for concealing; but for such a
combined tribute to self and nation
there is only one treatment.
Mr. W. And that is—?
P. Publicity.
Mr. W. Cautious, though. We must
look into this thing. The bag's got
several holes, but there's only one right
one to let the cat out of.
P. One of Mrs. CAy's young men is
waiting to see you, Sir. Perhaps he
can help us.
Mr. W. What's his line?
PARTON turns over the pages of a little
book and then reads, “Stanhope, PHILIP
—Form.”
Mr. W. Form ' That don't mean any-
thing. Must be a misprint. Well, show
him in-and, PARTON!
P. Yes, Sir?
Mr. W. Guess I'll feel freer to tackle
him alone. No offence.
P. Very well, Sir.
PARTON's exit is followed almost
immediately by the entrance of Mr.
STANHoPE, who is plainly—not very
carefully—dressed, and who looks like
a man who has the habit of trying not
to smile.
Mr. W. Morning, Mr. STANHoPE.

that it is—what's the formula 2–no

Mr. W. You're the best Mrs. CAY has

begin?
Mr. WATTLE's manner becomes vio-
lently indifferent as he hands to Mr.
STANHOPE the Emperor WILLIAM's invita-
tion, and asks: How shall I answer
this?.
Mr. STANHoPE runs it through half to
himself, half aloud, and then says un-
impressed: Oh, the usual way. Write

Mr. W. But shall I accept2
Mr. S. Why, I think I should, if you
can conveniently be in Berlin at that

Mr. W. But I have scruples, Sir,

Mr. S. (smiling). Overcome them.
Mr. W. Young man, I was brought
up to despise monarchs.
Mr. S. Very well, then, decline.
Mr. W. But as this invitation is indi-
rectly a compliment to the country of
which I have the honour to be a citizen,
perhaps a new and higher duty calls
upon me to accept.
Mr. S. Why on earth do you call it a
compliment?
Mr. W. Why? ... Why? ... Well,
of all the cheek!
Mr. S. I mean this sort of thing is an
old story now. The Emperor WILLIAM

MORE CHAT AT CHATSWORTH.
(By the Author of “Words with Words-
worth,” “Harm from Harmsworth,”
&c., &c.)
[The DUKE is reported to have said to a
policeman, who would have kept the crowd at a
long distance from His MAJESTY and the other
Chatsworth guests, “O ‘let 'em all come’ and
see the sport."]
DURING one of the rehearsals of Mr.
LEO TREvoR's play, a sempstress, who
was engaged in stitching together two
of the back cloths, had the misfortune
to slip from the step-ladder on which
she was standing, and fall heavily.
“What ho, she bumps ' ' exclaimed the
DUKE, and, reassured and sustained by
the good humour which these timely
words aroused, the sempstress, who was
happily unhurt, resumed her work with
unabated diligence.
An odd incident occurred during one
of the big shoots. On rounding a
corner in the three-thousand-acre spin-
ney His MAJESTY and fellow-guests sud-
denly came upon an elderly beater
dressed, although it was a sharp morn-
ing, in a complete suit of gold-beater's
skin. Directly he saw Mr. BALFour,
who was walking with the guns and
munching a biscuit, the man cried out
several times in a loud voice, “Your
food will cost you more.” “Balmy on
the free crumpet,” was the DUKE's laconic
comment, as he significantly tapped the
massive frontal development for which
the CAVENDISHEs are so famous.
At lunch on the same day the conver-
sation turned on the idiosyncrasies of
the guests in regard to the way in
which they liked to be helped to the
huge baron of beef which, in accordance
with the practice prevailing among the
upper ten, i. graces the board
on these occasions. After everyone had
expressed his or her opinion, appeal was
made to the host to state his predilec-
tion. “O, just a little bit off |. top,”
was the cheery response of the great
Derbyshire magnate.
Golf, as is well known, formed a
prominent feature in the pastimes of
the Chatsworth week. But none of the
press representatives recorded the in-
teresting fact that the DUKE renamed
all the principal hazards on the course
in honour of the occasion, the most
formidable bunker being christened
“Joe.” When, therefore, Mr. BALFour
carried the hazard with a fine tee shot,
the DUKE exclaimed with extraordinary
readiness, “Well played, BALFOUR. Glad
to see you're ‘not for JoE’ this time.”
This happy revival of a mid-Victorian
jest so convulsed BEN SAYERs, the
famous professional, who was partnering
the DUKE, that he had to be carried home

[JANUARY 20, 1904.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
It is universally admitted that vivacity
at the breakfast-table is the severest
test of a good conscience. From this
ordeal the Duke of DEVONSHIRE invariably
emerged with the utmost distinction.
For example, his favourite mode of
saluting his titled guests on their
entering the salle-à-manger, was, “Good
morning. Have you used Peers' soap?”
Finally, when, after the departure of
the Royal guests, the house-party were
indulging in a game of “I spy,” the
DUKE, emerging from cover during an
animated rally, petrified the assembly by
daunting Mr. BALFour with the gay
challenge, “Chase me, ARTHUR' "
A PROTEST.
[A writer in the Genealogical Magazine has
taken upon himself to fix the order of pre-
cedence of the most important cities of the
three kingdoms. He assigns the first place
to London, having clearly overlooked the
claims of a certain burgh in the kingdom of
Fife.]
O' a' the havers heard by me—
An' havers I’ve heard mony—
I doot this last appears to be
Aboot the worst o' ony;
An' when I read yon feckless loon
It puts me on my mettle
To see a place like Lunnon toon
Set up aboon Kingskettle.
What's Lunnon? Fog that fills your
lungs,
An' air ye canna swallow,
An' people speakin' in sic tongues
A body canna follow.
Eh! sic an awccent as they lairn
When schule they have attended,
While here the vera weest bairn
Is easy comprehended.
It's no a hame-like place at a';
It's fu'o' noise an' worry,
An' nae one kens nor cares wha's wha,
An' a' is hurry-scurry.
Ye'll wanner up an' doon the street
Through myriads o' men, Sir,
An' never ken a soul ye meet,
Or meet a soul ye ken, Sir.
How different in bonny Fife!
Here fouks are mair than ciphers;
A man's a man an' life is life
Amang the canny Fifers.
But pit your heid ootside the door
Ye'll get some conversation
Aboot the prospects o' a war,
Tariffs or education.
Things bein’ sae, a Fifeshire man
Maunaye be, willy-nilly,
Mair highly educated than
Thae fules o' Piccadilly.
Sae I wad ask yon feckless loon
Gin he decides to settle
That Lunnon is the foremaist toon,
Whaur will he pit Kingskettle?
“THE LONG RESULT OF TIME.”
“Tout vient à point pour celui qui sait
attendre.”

THAT the Government does not neg-
lect its executive duties merely because
a matter under consideration cannot be
disposed of in an instant, is evidenced
by the following items of intelligence:–
The Home-Secretary, Mr. ARETASAKERs
Douglas, has intimated his intention to
reprieve the convict GUY FAwkes, con-
demned for an attempt to blow up the
Houses of Parliament, the sentence to
be commuted to one of penal servitude
for life. An intimation of the reprieve
has been forwarded to the secretary of
the extensively signed petition placed
before the King at the time of the
prisoner's conviction.
| The Secretary for Scotland has or-
|dered a strict enquiry into the alleged
|massacre at Glencoe.
Mr. BRODRICK, having encountered a

|India by Mr. WARREN HASTINGs, has for-
warded a note to that gentleman inform-
ing him that unless the rigour of his
government be mitigated the Secretary
|for India will be unable to continue
Mr. HASTINGs in his position.
Mr. ALFRED LYTTELTON has intimated
to the inhabitants of Boston in America
his intention to recommend the imme-

The Public Prosecutor has received
instructions to take proceedings against
the Directors of the South Sea Company.
Lord SELBORNE has issued an order
reprimanding Admiral Sir FRANCIs DRAKE
for temporary neglect of duty in con-

XXVIII.--THE ANIMAL-LovERs.
ALL the afternoon the sun
has hung a blood-red ball in
a sky of leaden grey. Lower
and lower it has sunk over
the houses, until now it has
diffused itself over the western
sky in a faint red glow.
The lamps are already alight
in the little side-street, and
shine steadily in the half
light; a small boy on a
bicycle zig-zags unstably
down the middle of the road;
a group of vague undefined
figures stand conversing out-
side one of the houses.
I pass on down the street
towards the warm glow of a
diminutive oil-shop at the
further end, faced at the other
corner by a little shanty with
dirty windows purporting, in
white letters, to be
“The Ideal Laundry: Gents'
shirts and collars dressed and
got up equal to new.” I
cross towards this unique
establishment and survey the
window show, consisting of a
stiff and immaculately white
collar on the one side, con-
trasted on the other with a
disreputable strip of limp
linen that has apparently
been rescued from a street

I stoop hastily and stroke
the kitten.
“My wife's conduct,” he
explains, “in summonsin' me

belief in 'uman nachur. I'm

I admit the discretion of
this transfer of affection.
“They never summons you,”
I remark sympathetically.
“They're faithful dumb
creechurs,” he observes.
I congratulate him on his
choice of adjectives.
“I shall 'dopt the pore little
blighter,” he informs me.
“I shall take 'im 'ome. It
ain't a pallis, but it's clean
an’ respectable.”
I stoop and reassure the
kitten upon these points. My
companion's tears have alto-
gether ceased, and he is
wreathed in smiles.
“Com 'ere yer bloomin'
little blue-eyed blighter,” he
exclaims, stooping and snap-
ping his fingers. The kitten
approaches him sideways with
arched back.

The kitten raises a loud yell
of pain.
“Orl right,” exclaims the
animal-lover, holding the
vituperative animal at arm's
fight. Pinned to the cur-
tains behind is a picture of an immodest
infant, delivering itself with a smirk
of the outspoken statement:-
ALL MY CLOTHES ARE At
THE IDEAL LAUNDRY
WHERE YOURS OUGHT TO BE.
I do my best to swallow this indig-
nity, taking so long over it that a
towsled lady with a flat-iron appears at
the curtain and regards me through it
with undisguised suspicion. As I turn
away I become conscious of a low
sound proceeding from the
other side of the road.
Leaning sideways against the door-
way of the illuminated oil-shop, his
frame shaken from time to time by a
smothered sob, is a man of ruffianly
aspect in a dirty muffler. One arm
supports him against the door-post,
while with the sleeve of the other he
wipes the tears from a stubbly cheek.
A plump tabby kitten with arched back
rubs itself sympathetically between his
open legs.

tial view of a woman busy with tea-

“Pore lil bloomin' kitten lost 'isself

I must admit that for a moment I
am at a loss what to do or say. The
kitten continues to rub itself against
his legs, I pull myself together and
feel for my handkerchief.

wiping the tears from his cheek.-

proachfully. “Wot's the matter with
yer? Can't yer see I’m adoptin' of

The kitten's language is becoming a
disgrace to the neighbourhood. At last
the animal-lover withdraws his arm
and places his protégé under his coat,
where it remains perforce struggling
hard and cursing under its breath.
“You’re a nice little blighter, you
are,” observes its guardian indulgently.
—“Don’t 'arf lay 'is tongue to it, do 'e?”
“Now then,” breaks in a voice from
behind us, “when you've finished.”
We face round in surprise. Standing
in the doorway of the oil-shop is a
woman of formidable build nursing a
baby. She looks squarely at my com-
panion.
“When you've finished,” she repeats.
The animal-lover, without relaxing
his grasp of the kitten, surveys her for
a moment in silence.
“I’m a lovervanimals,” he observes.
“What are yer doin' ter that kitten?”
demands the lady.
“I’m takin' of it 'ome,” he replies.
“It's cold an' starvin'.”
“Takin' it 'ome, are yer?” demands
the lady indignantly.

STUDIES OF BLIGHTED LIVES.
W.--THE HIGHER KIND of PoET.
[Mr. AlFRED AUSTIN is about to lecture before the Royal Institution
on “The Growing Distaste on the part of the Many for the Higher
Kinds of Poetry."]
THE laws that treat of rights and wrongs
I care not greatly who composes;
Let me construct the nation's songs,
And someone else may be her Moses:—
So (roughly) ran the immortal phrase,
And though I can't recall who said it
Full well I know that nowadays
He wouldn't earn the faintest credit.
How sadly changed the prospect seems
From what beguiled my early summers,
Passed in the haunt of poets' dreams,
The breeding hive of brainy hummers!”
0 age of unrecorded feats!
ow fair the hopes our boyhood built on
Who meant in time to coo like KEATs,
Or have an organ-mouth like MILTON'
What bard has ever rightly sung
The thoughts that made our bosoms swell up,
When not the biceps, but the lung
Was what we panted to develop !
When, careless though our fame was mute
Upon the school's athletic panels,
We let our swift ambitions shoot
Down purely literary channels.
Spurning the rude barbarian sport
That makes the modern youth's diversion,
We found our leisure all too short
For WoRDsworth's nobly-planned Ezcursion;
Avoiding scenes of vulgar mirth,
We trod the track of Gomeril's treasons,
We dived with DANTE under earth,
We strolled with Thomson round the Seasons.
So, when I reached a riper age,
And recognised my vocal mission,
And found my glorious heritage
Wrapped up with England's best tradition,
I had a passion all along,
Deep in my inmost vitals rooted,
To keep intact the well of song
Which CHACCER left us unpolluted.
Speechless at times, through want of thought,
I burned the dim nocturnal taper;
At times my brain was overwrought
With serving on a daily paper;
But oft I soared with SHELLEY's lark
Through the adjacent empyrean,
And spent the day till after dark
Emitting one continuous paran.
Wain, vain employ! The common ruck,
That raves of RANJ1, Tich, or VARDON,
How could it have the taste to pluck
The precious blooms that prank my Garden?
What hope for horny-handed churls
That seem to take a wanton pleasure
In overlooking obvious pearls,
While hunting discs of dubious “treasure”?
* “What is more gentle than a wind in summer?
What is more soothing than the pretty hummer
That stays one moment in an open flower
And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower?”—KEATs.
Not for myself I mourn so much,
For though my private larynx varies
I joy to keep in constant touch -
With England's roll of pure canaries;
That legacy, the “Higher Kind”
To which a Laureate owes his billet—
Though lavished on the deaf and blind,
No mere neglect can wholly kill it!
i
Yet I am something more than bird,
I am the nation's seer and mystic,
Ordained to lift the humble herd
i By efforts largely altruistic;
And if I cannot move the mob
| And leave them rather less benighted,
Why, then I score a futile blob,
And must regard my life as blighted. O. S.

ur Representative called yesterday on the Proprietor of
High Thinking, who courteously consented to state his views,
as follows:—“It is a regrettable incident, of course, but I
should hardly think any of our readers will go quite so far
another time. In any case, we cannot be held liable for mis-
calculations they may make in following our ‘clues.' I have
| taken Counsel's opinion on that point. We were most careful
to warn our readers that the money was not placed inside any
building, or even immediately near it. As a matter of fact,
the building indicated was not St. Paul's at all, but a sacred
edifice of even more ancient and historic associations. We
could scarcely be expected to foresee that any treasure-hunter
would resort to an explosive of such high power. It is really
marvellous what things some people will do for money. But,
as I said before, we admit no legal responsibility whatever.
Our aim has always been to awake the dormant intelligence
of the Public and teach them to use their brains. Yes, the
collapse of the Dome is a magnificent advertisement for
High Thinking—the circulation has been going up by leaps
and bounds ever since.”

FISCAL LETTERS.
(Being Mr. Punch's Guide to the writing of them.)
No. I.
To the Editor of (any paper will do, but the “Times”
preferred.
SIR,-May I crave a small amount of your space in order
to point out to your correspondent, H. A. DEWTHAIR, that the
figures he cites to prove the prosperity of the country are
entirely misleading? He takes iron and steel f.o.b., c.o.d.,
fi.c., and by the simple process of adding corn, coal and
timber (planks, not logs—the distinction is important), and
then multiplying the result by the square root of foreign
dairy produce, less the usual percentage for butter and
cheese consumed in transitu, he produces the startling figure
of £99,000,000 7s. 2%d. But he has utterly failed to take
into account the figures of the glass-eye industry as shown
in the Blue Book at page 15,645. Even before these were
published, it was well known to all who took an interest in
the question that, owing to the prevalence of cheap sand in
the northern parts of Africa, our glass-eye manufacturers
were being driven out of the markets of the world. Now,
it seems, we are losing the home-market as well. In the year
1902–3 only 679 native eyes were sold, as against 1,141 in
the year 1872–3. What does Mr. DEwTHAIR say to this?
Is he going to take it lying down? Or will he add his
weight to those who are endeavouring to cement the Empire
together by the steel bonds of preferential tariffs? Let him
considerere it be too late. Yours, &c., JAMES JoBSON.
No. II. (Answer to above).
SIR,-Sir JAMES JoBSON has endeavoured to impugn the
accuracy of the very striking figures I laid before your
readers. How has he done this? Not by proving that I
erred even by so much as a halfpenny in my calculations
(which must therefore, I take it, be accepted henceforth as
sound), but by bringing forward the case of glass eyes. Sir
JAMES points to the state of that industry, which he appears
to think has been ruined by the importation of cheap African
eyes. What he wants, no doubt, is a heavy duty. I beg to
ask him, first, what he proposes to do about the drawback,
and in what category he means to place the semi-finished
eye imported in bond and left to be worked up by English
labour? Then again he must remember that the finished
article of one industry is the raw material for others. To
Sir JAMEs a glass eye is a glass eye. To a one-eyed man it
is the raw material by which alone he can carry on success-
fully such industries as (1) associating on equal terms with
his fellow men; (2) making love. Finally I beg to protest
once more against the scandalous way in which the year
1872–3 is brought against us. Everybody knows, even if
Sir JAMEs does not, that it was affected by the Franco-
German war and cannot therefore count. Taking the usual
quinquennial periods we are steadily increasing our output
even of glass eyes. What our manufacturers require is
enterprise and skill, not protection. For instance, what is
the use of sending a consignmel ; of pale blue eyes to the
South of Italy? You may ask me who did this? I reply,
Sir JAMEs Jobson. Yours, &c. H. A. DEwTHAIR.

profound learning of the one with the glittering humour of
the other, while preserving the verve and violence of both,
and avoiding the extreme length of Sir H-NRY.
No. III.
SIR,--Events are now eventuating precisely as I ventured
to predict they would when I addressed you last week and
showed how a good man, for we were entitled at that time
to consider him a good man, as he had not yet given in his
adhesion to the malevolent designs of an abandoned and
disappointed time-serving lawyer, may in spite of those who
call out to him, as I have endeavoured to do, be dragged at
the heels of those who are not and never have been any
better than what they ought. I want to ask the Duke of
DEVONSHIRE a plain question, to which I trust—I say, I trust,
though that trust has hitherto been basely abused by those
who, to gain their private ends, have shipwrecked the
Empire, thrown a great party on its beam-ends, and seri-
ously annoyed Mr. BALFOUR, whose duties at this time are
so important that common prudence should warn us not to
add by even a straw (and straw comes from corn) to his
many troubles—he will answer as plainly as it is put. Let
ally more and more animated and recriminatory, until in his
last letter Sir JAMES JoBSON insinuates that his opponent is
“no gentleman and a very ignorant one at that,” to which
Mr. DEwTHAIR retorts that Sir JAMES has feathered his nest
by a long career of sweating, and has a brother, deceased,
who was convicted of bribery in a municipal election. The
controversy is then transferred to the Law Courts.
In the next example Mr. Punch endeavours to fuse into
one those two Tariffian protagonists, Sir H-NRY H-w-RTH and
him come to Bradford. He'll find me there ready for him
day or night, rain or shine. We Yorkshiremen are a hard-
headed lot, and I'll engage to give the Duke of DEvoNSHIRE,
or, for the matter of that, Mr. Cox, two stone and a beating
over any course they like to name. We must of course feed
on Quaker Oats and wear wool next our skin. That is where
the true remedy will be found. Yours faithfully,

[JANUARY 27, 1904.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AMONG THE IMMORTALS AT THE BURLINGTON.
LET no one with an hour to spare miss the present chance
of scraping acquaintance, or of renewing it, with the Old
Masters now hibernating at Burlington House. For those
who have a bare sixty minutes at their disposal this guide
to certain important points in the show is primarily intended:
but it will serve as a gentle reminder for such as “have
been there and still would go.”
1. A “Pietà" by MEMLING, lent by Sir HENRY THOMPson,
Bart. “Rocky and wooded landscape, with water in the
back nd.” "Absolute freedom from dust-carts here, con-
cerning which necessary nuisances Sir HENRY has recently
been writing to the Times. “Dust like the picture?” as
Claude Melnotte asks. And the spectator, who may not be
in sympathy with the figures in the foreground, will answer,
“Distance lends enchantment to the view.”
2. “Portrait of a Lady,” of the Early French or Flemish
School. We are not informed how early the school was,
nor whether it was an infant or day school. She is a
pretty lady, with an artistically arranged coif. Probably
representing a Mistress, or, to put it more correctly, a female
teacher, in either school. If you ask, “Where are her pupils?”
la réponse saute aux yeux.
“Portrait of a Gentleman,” by FRANÇois CLOUET, called
JANET. Why “FRANÇois” should call himself “JANET,”
unless he were hopelessly effeminate, is a puzzle. However,
we leave it at that. #. picture, numbered 7, is unique
in the collection, for it is the one and only “Portrait of a
Gentleman" at this moment within the five Galleries of
Burlington House! Fact. Probably unprecedented. There
are two or three single ladies represented in this exhibition,
likewise “A Man,” 40; and if age be indicated by number,
the “Man’’ is decidedly eligible, though otherwise not good
sº to pair with “A Lady” at present hanging out at
o. 2.
Also there is “A Spanish Gentleman” (JUAN BAPTISTA DEL
MAzo created him), who might possibly be paired off for a
coranto with “A Lady" by REMBRANDT, but for the fact that
the lady is 77, and the “Spanish Gentleman” is 83, and so
their dancing days are over.
There is, too, a “Young Man,” 32 (he doesn't look it),
“with hand on skull” (not his own, but the skull of some-
body else, defunct), who may probably be an amateur playing
Hamlet, or giving a phrenological lecture, or a University
man of the period explaining the use of the skulls, boat-
racing, and §: ut, as has been noticed above, as
worthy of remark, No. 7 is the one and only “Portrait of a
Gentleman,” whose artistic qualification for these Galleries is
that he looks as if he deserves to be hung.
8. “Lady Reading.” There is no mention or allusion to
“Lord Reading,” so we may suppose the title extinct. The
É. of it is unknown, but he was “M.A.” in the great
lemish School.
27. “Landscape with Figures,” by Giorgion.E. Done
probably when his mother gave very young Master GEORGY
ONyashilling box of paints just to keep him out of mischief.
35. “Three Children playing Music" (by Fra BARTo-
LoMME0). Never was titular description more misleading.
The one thing correct in it is that there are three children.
They have “noddings on,” and, wherever their shamefully
neglectful parents and guardians may be, these infants are
apparently seated on the base of a stone pedestal, such
as you may see in Trafalgar Square, for example, in a
state of nudity that ought to, and it is to be hoped will,
attract the attention of the police. The central infant has
possessed himself of a lute and is playing at playing it,
while his companion in mischief, on his right, is ºil.
“only purtendin’,” to hold a music-book for him. The other
little chap, on his left, has his eyes fixed longingly on the
instrument which he evidently intends to secure for his
own delectation on the very first opportunity. This picture
might aptly be presented, with Dr. BIRCH's compliments, to
a “Smack Boys' Home.”
41. This picture shows what a very queer sort of idea
CARLo CRIVELLI had of “St. George.” The painter represents
him as a sort of hero of comic opera, ić. in his left
hand a barber's pole which he has been using as a lance.
Compare this with a model in wax for a statuette on same
subject (Case J., No. 1), and you will see what a St. George
and Dragon can be when they like.
Let us say at once that all the Lawrences are simply
delightful. “Lady Hamilton” (44) lovely; “Countess of
Leitrim and Daughter” (60) charming, and so perfectly
natural as to present the strongest possible contrast to (62
“Mrs. Angerstein and Child,” a melancholy self-conscious
couple, treated in summery fashion as to costume, though
they are represented as walking out in very doubtful weather
by the sad sea wave.
46. Spirited picture, representing “Mrs. Maguire” in her
heroic act of preventing a big dog from eating little ARTHUR
FitzJAMES by grasping the topjaw of its open mouth. Sir
THOMAS LAwrence, P.R.A.
52. How his parents ever came to allow dear little Master
LAMBTON, dressed in his best black velvet suit, with ve
much open collar, to sit out on a stormy day, and to perc
himself up on a dangerous height in order to oblige Sir
THOMAS LAwRENCE, is a puzzle; and where Sir THOMAs placed
himself in order to take this portrait, must ever remain one
of the mysteries of Art to the delighted spectator.
54. “Portrait of Mrs. Gott.” Sir Thomas shows her as a
very determined-looking, but dashing style of lady: of a
certain age 'tis true, “with,” evidently, “a past,” yet still
with a roguish eye, so expressive of her being “capable de
tout,” that the descriptive title of the portrait might truly be
“Hard and Fast.”
We will pause for a moment in Gallery No. III., before
PARMEGIANO's “Portrait of an Italian Lady.” With her
pallid face, strained attitude, and fearfully pained expression
of countenance, she might have sat for her portrait as a
“sufferin' lady,” or “Maria piccola” of Signor BARRIE’s
eccentric creation.
Our time is limited, and regretfully we must bid adieu to
our most approved good Masters. Fortunate is the visitor
who can pay several visits, or who is able to pass on to
Galleries IV. and W., and thence to the bronzes.
FROM AN EARNEST STUDENT OF ANCIENT HISTORY.—SIR,-Can
you inform me who was “Episodes?” Was he a Greek
Philosopher? Did he, as other philosophers did, keep a
school, weekly or monthly 2 My immediate reason for asking
is because I see in the advertisement of the National Review
an article on “Episodes of the Month.” I confess this
philosopher's name, though not unfamiliar, is somewhat new
to yours truly, SCHOLAST.
NEw Trries for DRAMAs At His MAJESTY's-As The Darling
of the Gods has caught on, it will probably be followed by The
Pet of the Pit, The Fancy of the Stalls, The Charmer of the
Upper Circles, and so forth.
“IN THE SPRING A YouNG MAN's FANCY, &c.”—Several young
and inexperienced singing birds were deceived by the recent
spell of mild weather; but the Daily Mail is surely old
enough to know better. Yet it has, with singular ingenuous-
ness, already flung open its columns to correspondence on
such Spring fancies as Love and Matrimony.

Cassandra-like persons, who said that
the Agamemnon of ÆscHYLUs in the

COUNSEL TO CORRE-
SPONDENTS.
By the Expert Wrinkler.
The CHOICE of NoTE-PAPER.
A GENTLEMAN, it has been
shrewdly said, is known by
his correspondence. It is im-
possible to overrate the im-
portance of having good
note - paper and envelopes.
Whether or not one writes
a good legible hand is imma-
terial; but there must be no
relaxation of effort towards
acquiring a sound variety of
cream-laid note. At the head
of the paper should be one's
address neatly stamped, also
telegraphic address and
nearest station. The colour
in which the stamping is
done is a matter of taste, but
the most toney people, I have
noticed, affect either black or
plain relief. On the other
hand, Lord , from whose
hospitable Castle I brought
away by inadvertence some
few quires of note-paper, and
envelopes to match, has chosen
a chaste blue ink. The best
hosts invariably place a liberal
allowance of writing necessi-
ties in their guests' rooms.
The shape of note-paper is not less
important than its quality. The best
people often affect very large sheets,
hand-made, gilt-edged, and endowed
with marks of the first water. Again,
there is a Duchess of my acquaintance
who writes in violet ink in an infini-
tesimal hand on infinitesimal sheets of
perfumed paper. She has written me
several letters, which may possibly have
been billets douac, and possibly reminders
of Bridge debts, but being quite unable
to read them I cannot say. I need
hardly add, however, that they are
among my most cherished possessions.
Personally, I write in a large bold hand
on Hieratica, small octavo, a variety of
note which is said to approximate most
nearly to that used by the ancient
Egyptians, who were in their day, as
you are doubtless aware, in the van-
guard of civilisation.
How To SELECT A PEN.
The question of pens, though less
vital, is not to be dismissed lightly.
By keeping my eyes open on week-end
visits to various ducal homcs, I have
noticed that the geyser pen is steadily
gaining ground, and will soon be in
everybody's mouth. Since my tailor,
however, has so strong an objection to
this invention that he refuses to build
me a special pocket to hold it (such as

Otherwise I accept the stamp
in the spirit in which it was
given, and we are the better
friends for it afterwards.

blessed with exquisite tact.
MISTER or Esquire.
If I have had one letter on
this subject I have had a
hundred. But the matter is
as plain as a pikestaff. All
commoners with incomes of
over £1,000 a year may be
safely addressed as Esquire,
and all tradesmen as Mr.
But I have found that if a
tradesman duns you for pay-
ment, you can generally stave
him off a bit by addressing
him as Esquire, or in extreme
cases by adding J.P. In
addressing a letter to a Peer,
neither Mr. nor Esquire is
required. But in writing to
the son of a Baron it rounds
off the address very nicely, as
thus: “Honble. MARMADUKE
PLANTAGENET, Esquire.”
Another point raised by a
correspondent is i. ſ.
should the wife of an officer
be addressed ? Should one
the Duke of — possesses), and since write simply Mrs. JENKINs or Mrs.
my man is not sufficiently expert with Major-General JENKINs 2 I think there
the needle to make a pocket at home, I
am compelled to adhere to pens of the
old-fashioned type. The best people, I
notice, scatter quills very liberally over
their writing-tables; but the quill is too
fretful a weapon for me—a simple “J”
pen suits me best, used in a holder
fitted with spaces on which to place the
fingers and thumb. To the steady em-
ployment of the helpful restraint of
this kind of pen I attribute the clear-
ness of my caligraphy.
SHOULD ONE PAY ONE's HostESS FOR
STAMPs 2
Although writing necessities are sup-
plied with generosity, it is unusual for
stamps to be added too; and I am fre-
quently asked by my readers the ques-
tion, Should one pay for stamps which
one obtains from one's hostess down-
stairs? This is a thorny point, not to
be answered offhand. § own way,
when my man has foolishly forgotten
to pack my stamps, is to watch the face
of my hostess, and also her hand, very
narrowly, although, I need hardly say,
without allowing her to detect the scru-
tiny. If I see the least suspicion of
eagerness in her expression, or any
twitch of her fingers suggesting their
anticipatory closing over a coin, I at
can be no doubt that the latter form is
preferable. But the rank of the officer
should not be added if it is below that
of Major. Certainly one should never
write Mrs. Lieutenant SMITH.
ANSWERS To CoRRESPONDENTs.
GoLDEN PlovER, Bickley.-Wafers are
no longer a sine quá mon; but a good
seal with one's armorial bearings upon it
is a pleasant possession. If you have
no armorial bearings your monogram,
neatly intertwined, with a suitable
motto, is desirable—such as Cave canem
or Ich diem.
CAPTAIN Woodward.-Yes, it is better
to remove the signet ring from the
finger before sealing hot wax.
CHATsworth. — “Yours faithfully ”
ought to meet the case—unless you
really wish to keep up the acquaintance.
Johan NES TERTIUs.—Kisses are indi-
cated by small crosses at the end of the
letter. Six should be enough, except in
exceptional cases.

that is “Our Dumb Friends' League.”

80ME FRESH DEVELOPMENTS OF THE
TREASURE-HUNTING GRAZE.
Owing to the inadequacy of the returns
from the Shepherd's Bush Gold Mine,
where a £50 medallion still escapes
detection, an influential syndicate of the
leading capitalists of Backyard Alley,
E.C., has been formed to exploit the
services of one thousand able-bodied
Chinese, who will be imported almost
immediately. It is confidently expected
that a very handsome dividend will thus
be realised, as no stone will be left
unturned to ensure success. Already
the shares are quoted at three farthings.
Meanwhile, it must be admitted that the
native population of this district is
greatly agitated over the new departure,
and at a mass meeting of ticket-of-leave-
men, rag-pickers, gutter-searchers, and
out-of-works, held last Saturday night
on the Green, some strong resolutions
were passed to protest against the latest
alien invasion and the infringement of
the rights, privileges and enterprise of
the true-born Briton. The assembly
was unanimous in favour of Protection
in this instance. A large body of police
has been drafted into the neighbour-
hood in anticipation of disturbance.
The extra charges thus incurred have
been debited to the local ratepayers,
who are preparing to organise a counter-
demonstration.
There has been of late a steadily-
increasing demand for truffle-dogs. The
breed is nearly extinct, and the supplies
of these useful and intelligent animals
from the New Forest and certain parts
of France are now quite depleted. The
few obtainable have been trained to
distinguish the presence of auriferous
rapid and remunerative turnover may
be expected. The same company also
furnishes tame clairvoyants and metal-
finders who have not yet been convicted
of obtaining money under false pretences,
and makes a speciality of wizards,
dowsers, and experienced clue-trackers,
whose services may be engaged by the
week or month. They are warranted to
continue a search until the patience or
|funds of their employer are exhausted.
The treasure-seeker's mania has been
the practical joker's opportunity. This
is proved by the large number of metal
discs recently unearthed, authorising
the finders to obtain fabulous sums from
the Editors of the Times, the Financial
|News, the Family Herald, the Bullionist,
and other papers who cannot be accused
of wild-cat proclivities. . A similarly
playful spirit has pervaded the police
force, who are indiscriminately arresting
any person caught stooping to tie up a
|boot-lace or appearing in public § a
newspaper in his hand. The joke has
thence extended to the Bench. Some of
our wittiest stipendiary magistrates have
been awarding real or suspected lucre-
hunters a few terms of seclusion of quite
a humorous length, such as fifty-one days
or nineteen weeks, and the public at large
have thoroughly entered into the sport.

KNOT FOR JOE.
Joseph Entangled is not a good title, but it is a most
amusing comedy. The ingenuity of its construction from
the commencement up to a certain point makes it all the
more puzzling to comprehend why the author, at the last,
had recourse to that oldest and stagiest of old stagey devices
for either clearing up or causing a difficulty, namely,
listening behind a curtain. This is the disappointing part
of it. If after his brilliant and most amusing First Act and
his carefully written Second (which would be still better
original surprise for us in the Third, the comedy, as far as
writing and construction go, would have been reckoned as
his very best since he gave us The Liars.
Whatever may be weak in authorship is lost sight of in
the strength of the cast at the Haymarket. With Mr. Cyril
MAUDE as Sir Joseph Lacy, not a fault can be found. The
smart man, with a gay-doggish reputation, taking himself
for condensation), HENRY AUTHOR JONES had only devised an

seriously as a lover, and ready as a true knight to defend a
lady, whom he has unwittingly and quite accidentally com-
promised, against all comers, is a type of the true plucky
English gentleman which Mr. MAUDErepresents easily, without
pose, without affectation, in fact to perfection. THACKERAY
would have loved this character as AUTHOR Jones has drawn
it, and as CYRIL MAUDE plays it. And who better for the
very fascinating, rather feather-headed lady, the táte de

afterwards.” The club scandal-mongers and smoking-
room gossips are capitally typified by Mr. SAM SoTBERN
as the timorous much-married Harry Tavender, by Mr.
KENNETH. Douglas as the youthful and not particularly bright
husband of Lady Joyce (Miss WINIFRED ARTHUR JONEs) who
is the unobtrusive cause of all this trouble, and by Mr.
Charles SUGDEN as Jermyn Pyecroft, the typical modern
man-about-town, “neat as a new pin.” in his get up,
thoroughly experienced in the ways of the world, professing
no principles, and disguising even from himself that he has
a keen sense of honour and a true appreciation of friendship.
Mr. EDMUND MAURICE is most amusing in the superfluous
character of Professor Tofield, while, as the primary con-
tributories to the entanglèment of Joseph, Mr. FREDERICK
Volpe, as the butler, and Mrs. CHARLEs CALVERT (the in-
imitable), as his wife, housekeeper in the service of Hardolph
Mayne, are two of the most humorous creations that the
author's study of life below stairs has given to the stage.
As Mrs. Tavender, the sharp-sighted little wife of a weak
husband, with a nose for the slightest scent of a scandal,
and the utmost aversion to anything like responsibility for
her words or actions, Miss BEATRICE FERRAR sustains her
well-earned reputation as a genuine actress of comedy.
The two hours occupied by the comedy pass quickly, and

ARE BIG MEN DOOMED :
THE statement recently attributed to Professor RAY
LANKESTER, that fossil remains of sharks measuring 240 feet
long had been discovered in the myeyecene formation, has
naturally created considerable sensation in scientific circles.
The editor of the Daily Inquisitor accordingly lost no time
in sending a representative to wait on the eminent savant at
South Kensington. Professor RAY LANKESTER was discovered
in the act of reconstructing the skeleton of a magnificent
tauralectryom, portions of which had been presented to the
Museum by Professor TRUNDLEY, of Peckham, but he good-
naturedly desisted from his labours when our Representative
was shown in.
“About this shark, Professor?”
“Well, there has been a slight but pardonable exaggera-
tion as to figures. What I said was 80 feet, but the §. of
by that sound comedian Mr. Sydney VALENTINE as a carpenter, three is generally followed in these cases. This does not,

THE DESCENT OF MAN.
[“Quite the latest thing in “cures’ is that known as the ‘four-footed'
cure, made in Berlin. It consists in making the patient walk on his
hands and feet, keeping the knees stiff, four times a day for twenty
minutes at a time. The origin of the idea is to be found in the belief
that standing upright is, after all, only a comparatively novel human
invention, the natural way of walking being that still in use by the
rest of the quadrupeds. Patients soon grow accustomed to it, and the
results . . . are said to be marvellous.”—Manchester Guardian.]
“UPRIGHT was man made”—so the sage averred,
And man, delighted with the novel attitude
Which marked him from the beasts, received the word
And cherished it, of course, with pride and gratitude.
I now declare the utterance a fiction,
And meet it with the flattest contradiction.
Man made himself upright. Ere he could talk,
Deep in primeval woods he used to tear about
On hands and feet; he only learnt to walk
Some hundred centuries ago or thereabout.
I hold his present mode of locomotion"
A passing whim, a vile new-fangled notion.
Why be such slaves to fashion? Let us not,
erely to gratify our human vanity,
Condemn ourselves to one long lingering lot
Of indigestion, sickness and insanity—
Just punishment of those who outrage nature
To add a paltry cubit to their stature.
Then lose no time! Down on your hands and feet!
The new position, when you're first reduced to it,
May not be all that you consider sweet,

In a few generations you'll be swearing

the discovery.
| “And what might that be?”
“Why, that the size of all living creatures is steadily
diminishing.”
“Does that apply, Professor, to the human species?”
“Certainly. There is now little doubt but that prehistoric
man was naturally of Brobdingnagian proportions; there is
also little doubt but that at the present rate of diminution
the normal stature of man in a few thousand years will never
exceed four feet.”
“Can nothing be done to stem this gradual progress
towards dwarfishness?”
“Nothing at all, I fear,” replied the Professor sadly. “We
must resign ourselves to the prospect of continuous shrinkage.
The big men are doomed. §. recent discoveries may
possibly provide an antidote. Something, for example, may
be hoped from the process of stopping teeth with pitchblende,
in the hope of stimulating radio-activity in the Eustachian
tube. Mr. WELLs is experimenting with a patent food, and
has already had to raise the roof of his house at Sandgate
by nine inches. I myself am giving a six months' trial to a
self-raising flour, and ”—here the Professor gazed compla-
cently at his massive proportions—“the results are not
altogether discouraging.”
“But why, Professor, should we endeavour to resist the
inevitable march of Nature, especially as animals are growing
smaller also 2 ''
“Ah,” rejoined Professor RAY LANKESTER, gloomily, “that
is where the mistake is made by optimistic sciolists. The
terrible truth is that man is growing smaller far more rapidly
than any other living creature. Lookround at all our leading
men, and what do you see? The stage led by LITTLE TICH.

{OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Evelina (MACMILLAN) is, in its way, a notable book. . The
authoress, FANNY Bursey (Mrs. or Miss?), has attempted, not
altogether without success, to reproduce a picture of the
manners and customs prevalent in London Society towards
the close of the eighteenth century. Whether a lady, young
or old, married or single, was well-advised in laboriously
treading these ancient pathways when, close at hand, she
has models of literary style and workmanship in Miss MARIE
CoRELLI and Mr. HALL CAINE, is a matter for private judg-
ment, a practice to be encouraged or deprecated by public
taste. However that be, my Baronite, uninfluenced by pre-
judice, admits that the effort is well-sustained. It is not
accomplished alone by cheap, references to Ranelagh in its
prime, or to talk about “a ridotto” and the like. As an
instance of the care with which vraisemblance is maintained
may be noted a reference to the celebrated Mr. GARRICK"
performing at Drury Lane Theatre. On referring to that
indispensable work of reference, the Encyclopædia Britannica,
it ºbe found that GARRICK was flourishing between the
period 1770–5, during which the story purports to have
been written. This has twofold interest. "It vindicates the
accuracy of Mrs. BURNEY's studies, and it shows that the
Encyclopædia Britannica is up to date—which indeed, it
ought to be, since my Baronite subscribed for his copy, b
telephone on “The Last Day.” Mr. Hugh THOMSON embel-
lishes the little comedy with a series of charming pictures
of girls' frocks of the time when GEORGE THE THIRD was King,
Mr. AustiN Dobson contributes what looks like a learned
Introduction. This my Baronite has skipped, shrinking from
the discipline of italics in which it is printed, and repelled
by the |. occurrence of the remark “and which.”
* may have been good style in the days of Queen ANNE,
an Augustan age in whose literature Mr. Dobson is said to
be versed. But Queen ANNE is dead, and in this twentieth
century there is a rooted prejudice against the pronoun with
or without the conjunction.
[“N.B.-This is a goak,” as ARTEMUs WARD used to say when he
feared he might be taken seriously. By the way, my Baronite's studious
ignorance as to whether FANNY Burney was Mrs. or Miss shows how
history repeats itself. In one of the earliest notices of Evelina, ap-
pearing in the Critical Review five quarters of a century ago, the
author was throughout alluded to as “he.”—The BARON.]
Though in Toy Gods (John LoNG) its author, PERCivAL
PICKERING, does not treat us to a very intricate plot, yet, as
full compensation for deficiency in this respect, is made b
variety and distinct delineation of character, the story will
be found thoroughly interesting, and one that will well
repay careful study. Decidedly it is not a book for the
light-hearted volatile “skipper.” Amelia Bradshaw, who
struggles up from gutter to drawing-room, is so cleverly
drawn, and so true to human nature, as to win the hearts of
all who have the pleasure of making her acquaintance. My
Baronitess cannot accept the author's charitable excuses for
the conduct of Sir Geoffrey Hope, whose behaviour will be
set down by all readers, in spite of anything apologetic that
the author of his existence may put forward in his favour,
as that of an unutterable cad. My Baronitess is of opinion
that by this time she has said enough to excite the curiosity
of all who value a clever piece of novelistic work.
From the same publisher comes The Lady of the Island,
which, as the first of a collection of short stories by GUY
Boothby, gives its name to the volume. This tale, A Professor
of Egyptology, The Convict Catcher, and A Strange Goldfield,
are “the pick of a basket,” in which nearly all are well up
to the author's best standard of work.
following the example of MoLIERE, who took his good things
where he found them, boldly annexes Sherlock Holmes. She
affixes her own label, calling him Julius Quayle. Otherwise
she is content to adopt the system and even the mannerisms
of Sir CoNAN Doyle's famous hero. His “onlie begetter” in
a moment of impatience once killed Sherlock Holmes. Miss
SERGEANT treats him even more despitefully. She gives him
away in marriage, a state of life wholly incompatible with
such an existence as the amateur detective devoted him-
self to, involving guarded movements and the keeping
of profound secrets. For the rest my Baronite finds The
Yellow Diamond a well-constructed story, bristling with
interest. There is a jewel robbery, an escape from
Dartmoor, a rencontre between two º villains,
complicated by the fact that a son and daughter, unknowing
their parents' past, desire to engage in matrimonial relations.
Finally there is a murder. Over all these scenes Julius
Quayle hovers, with Sherlock Holmes's wan smile and his
rare gift of putting two and two together in the way of clues
to mysterious crimes.
The authoress of The House on the Marsh is one of the
Baron's favourite romancists. When she sets herself to
make your flesh creep she can do it in a manner that would
have caused “young Touch-and-go,” otherwise the Fat Boy
(so styled by Sam Weller), to quiver like a blanc-mange. With
this º: the Baron begs permission to introduce, to those
who honour him by accepting his recommendation, Flore.NCE
WARDEN's latest, entitled The Mis-Rule { Three(FISHERUNwiN).
The sole objection to the book is its title, which is, the Baron
supposes, intended to be humorous, and achieves its object in
much the same way as Mr. Peter Magnus achieved his when
In .# notes to intimate acquaintances he sometimes signed
himself “Afternoon,” which, observed Mr. P. M., “amuses
my friends very much.” However, as the rose, even with
the prefix of cabbage, retains its own peculiar perfume,
so this romance remains a seriously-written, sensational
story, with a startling dénoament, thoroughly original in
conception and artistic in construction. The #: refuses
even to hint at what the mystery of the story is: for not
only is it a lady's secret, the inviolability of which he is
bound to respect, but also it is not his to give away, and
were he to betray his trust he would be ruining the enjoy:
ment of those among his followers who, on his advice, will
seize this book with avidity, and not let it out of their
hands until they have exhausted
its contents to the uttermost line
of the last chapter. One word
of warning : don't expect too
much from the first two chapters,
wherein three jolly companions, /
apparently suggested by the cele- ſº
brated trio of musketeers, threaten
to become so many twaddling tº
nuisances. Bear with them pa-
tiently; they don't last long, and
when they do crop up now and
again the wearisomeness of their
ensemble has entirely disappeared.

HOW THE LAST RUN OF THE WOPSHIRE HOUNDS WAS SPOſl_T.
VIEWS ON THE CRISIS.
Mr. Punch has great pleasure in
placing before his readers the views of
some of our leading publicists on the
great question of the hour, as expressed
by them in conversation with his Repre-
sentative:–
Mr. A. C., MACLAREN said that though
depressed by the result of the third Test
Match he did not give up hope. There
were still two º to be played, and
if the M.C.C. team won the next the
rubber was assured; even if they lost
it, there still remained a reasonable
chance of their pulling off the final
contest. The battle was never lost until
it was won : contrariwise it was never
won until it was lost. He reminded the
interviewer that hope springs eternal in
the human breast, and that what Lanca-
shire thought to-day England would
think to-morrow.
Mr. C. B. FRY remarked to our inter-
viewer that the situation, though serious,
was by no means desperate. In cricket,
as elsewhere, the unexpected frequently
happened. Furthermore, it must not be
forgotten that the climatic and atmos-
pheric conditions of the Antipodes
differed from those of the mother
country. Personally, he set great store
on the contagious example of personality.
WARNER was the “Sunny Jim” of cricket.
Finally, he pointed out that it would be
premature to indulge in pessimistic
anticipations when two matches still
remained to be played.
Prince RANJITsINHJi said that he en-
dorsed every word that fell from his
gifted confrère. WARNER was a man of
most commanding personality, but so on
the other hand were TRUMPER, Noble and
Hopkins. He thought the return of
TRUMBLE to the arena one of the most
touching incidents in the annals of our
times. It reminded him of BELISARIUS
or was it CINCINNATUs?
GAUKRoDGER said that he had been
deeply affected by the news of WARNER's
defeat. But every cloud had a silver
lining, and he earnestly hoped that they
would have better luck next time. In
reply to the interviewer GAUKRODGER
further stated that he had never heard
of Mr. ANDREW LANG.
THE statement, frequently found in
St. Petersburg journals, that the aims of
Russia are “Pacific,” must of course be
taken in a littoral, rather than a moral,
sense.
VENTNOR, on the “English Riviera,”
must look to her laurels. The Liverpool
Echo records the following phenomenon:
“Southport—24 hours' bright sunshine
registered yesterday.”
A MODERN PASTORAL,
THROUGH the meads as STREPHON goes,
He bewails his hapless lot;
In his heart are bitter woes,
For his CHLoe cometh not :
To a strain of fond recall
Oft he tunes his oaten reed,
But its echoes idly fall;
Somehow CHLOE does not heed.
Huddled kine would gladly greet
What they've never found to fail:
Welcome patter of her feet,
Merry clatter of her pail;
Ah, no more with laughing lip
STREPHON's favours will she don,
Never down the meadows trip—
CHLOE's occupation's gone!
STREPHON | since we daily see
Hustling Science will not wait,
Lend thy pipe a newer key;
Chloe's done and out of date;
When you give us songs to rouse
Thoughts of pastureslushandgreen,
Sing The Milking of the Cows
By Electrical Machine !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S FISCAL BALLADS.
A series of visits at short intervals to the Alhambra Music-
hall has convinced Mr. Punch that the management are
greatly in need of a new song on the Fiscal Question. The
impassioned appeal to
“Buy! Buy! Buy! at the John Bull's store,”
however admirably rendered, palls somewhat with repetition,
and even the portrait of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, thrown upon the
screen by a magic lantern after Verse 3. is only mildly
stirring to the jaded spectator. To help the Alhambra manage-
ment out of their difficulty Mr. Punch would be happy to
supply them with a succession of Fiscal. Ballads, either
pro-tariff or anti-tariff, for use in their excellent programme
at a moderate figure.
If they prefer to keep to the pro-CHAMBERLAIN side the
following ditty, sung with due heartiness, should attract
enormous audiences nightly. It might be called:
ExpoRTs AND IMPORTs.
In the golden days of GEORGE THE THIRD
You'll find in history written
That no complaints were ever heard
Of dumping goods in Britain.
Our import duties were so high
They prevented Boney's landing,
And GEORGE THE FourTH and the late Lord North
Kept British trade expanding!
CHORUs (tempo di valso).
If our exports exceed our imports,
Britannia will rule the waves.
If our imports exceed our exports,
Then Britons will soon be slaves.
(Da capo.)
But now our Trade is Free to all,
And so it's not surprising
That while each year our exports fall
Our imports still are rising.
On every side our industries
Are crying for Protection,
(ff.) So we must go and vote for JoF
At the General Election'
(Chorus as before.)
This is quite in the best style of Fiscal ballad. A faint
flavour of history, mostly wrong. A mingling of economics
and patriotism so complete that you never know whether the
singer is running up the Union Jack or a column of half-
pence. And a chorus of concise mis-statements. What more
can a popular audience ask?
Should the Alhambra public evince a desire to hear the
Free Trade side of the question wedded to lyric verse,
Mr. Punch recommends the following. The verses should
be sung jauntily, as befits their galloping rhythm, but
the chorus gives opportunity for the most heart-breaking
pathos:
AND THAT’s what I'M AFRAID of !
Britons, don't be led away by CHAMBERLAIN's predictions,
His prophecies are mostly lies and half of his facts are
fictions;
He'll tax the boots upon your feet, the wool your clothes are
made of,
He'll tax the wheat the poor must eat—and that's what I'm
afraid of !
CHORUS (adagio ma non troppo).
Your food will cost you more 1
This fact you can't ignore:

PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE.
Your bread will be dear,
And so will your beer—
(f) Your food will cost you more 1
Britons, don't be led away by tariff agitation,
The Cobden Club is still the hub of the glorious English
nation'
Don't believe the figures JoE has made so much parade of,
They're rather long and he adds them wrong—and that's
what I'm afraid of !
CHORUS (andante espressivo).
Your food will cost you more 1
I've told you this before:
Your American wheat
And your Argentine meat—
(ff.) They both will cost you more
A magic-lantern portrait of Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN
arm-in-arm with the Duke of DEVONSHIRE would be a fitting
Fº to this ditty, and win a host of adherents to Free
ItaCle.
Mr. Punch's attention has been called to the fact that The
Guardian is “Entered at the New York Post-office as Second-
class Matter.” The communication comes from a clergyman,
and is borne out by a printed statement at the head of the
journal in question: otherwise Mr. Punch would not have
given it credence.
ANOTHER STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE!—An elderly gentleman,
a respected member of a certain Borough Council, who a few
days ago entered a protest, has not been seen again. For the
present we suppress names, as the mysterious affair is in the
hands of the police.

MR. SEDDON INTERVENES.
[The Colonial SECRETARY, replying to Mr. SEDDON's protest against
the employment of Chinese labour on the Rand, pointed out that "the
Imperial Government could not refuse to accede to the wishes of one

In bulk a giant and for work a glutton'
High Arbiter of Britain's destinies,
Ånd champion of the cause of frozen mutton –
Tower of defence, impenetrably thick,
Our shield against the coming Armageddon,
Known to familiar friends as “Good Old DICK,”
And to the common mass as “Kaiser SEDDON”!—
Whose word on questions which admit of doubt
Clinches the problem like a pair of tweezers;
Whose warmth and tireless tendency to spout
Betray the influence of local geysers:-
Sir, we are greatly favoured by your last
Imperial Bull (received and noted duly),
In which your Excellency deigns to cast
Nº. on the heathen coolie.
Your eagle orb, annihilating space,
Has looked askance upon your Afric neighbour,
Fearing to have your own adjoining place
Contaminated by celestial labour.
Or else a filial motive fanned your zeal.
England had need of you; you would not leave her
In lack of counsel, wondering how to deal
With symptoms indicating yellow fever.
A plain acknowledgment must here suffice,
So full of speechless thanks the parent State is,
Antipodean Sir, for your advice,
Tendered unasked and absolutely gratis.
But if her sense of gratitude is such,
How can the bursting heart convey its tension
There on the actual Rand that owes so much
To you and your so timely intervention?
No doubt the infant means to pay his debts;
He'll write a protest, eloquent and flowery,
Inquiring if the Motherland abets
The way in which you pamper Little Maori.
And England, treating all alike by turns,
Will gravely read each question when they ask it,
And, having bid them mind their own concerns,
Depose the fragments in the paper-basket. O. S.

date January 26, the shooting of “a Bohemian Chatterer.”
It was said that the specimen in question was a rara avis.
Not a bit of it. There are lots more “Bohemian chatterers”
in London. But as to the advisability of reducing their
number by shooting some of the biggest, well—that is a
matter for further deliberation.

PIECE WITH HUMOUR.
CAPTAIN Robert MARSHALL describes his most amusing play
in three Acts as “A Farcical Romance,” and thereby serious
criticism is at once disarmed. All that has to be decided is
whether such a piece acts up to its description, and whether
the farcical be so adroitly mixed with the romantic as that
neither shall unduly preponderate. Captain MARSHALL has
achieved this result to a nicety: the i. is artistically
preserved: probabilities are dispensed with ; and, on the
whole, sentiment is so adroitly introduced as to intensify the
humour. The actors, thoroughly in earnest, play as if the
characters they are rendering were real people moving in
actual life; and so the audience, taking the right tone from
these well-qualified representatives of the author's bizarre
idea, heartily join in the joke, and acclaim the piece and its
exponents º enthusiastic delight.
Mr. GRAHAM BRowNE is unconventionally light-comedian-
hearted as the still youthful Duke of Killicrankie. ... •
Mr. WEEDON GROSSMITH, who was last in evidence on the roof
of a sinking house in an overflow performance at Drury Lane,
is now landed securely on the stage of the Criterion, and has
taken his seat in this house as Henry Pitt-Welby, Esq., M.P.,
though what constituency has the honour of having him for
its Member is not quite clear. His politics are nebulous, his
M.P.-cuniosity most decided. As a character he is a queer
mixture, and Mr. WEEDON GROSSMITH plays it for all it is
worth and a good deal more. As an actor he is a man of
business, that is of stage-business, just as Miss MARIE
ILLINGTON, who so amusingly impersonates, the rich widow,
Mrs. Mulholland, whose wealth has attracted this Member for
an empty-pocket borough, and whose charms have fascinated
him, is, as an actress, a thorough “woman of business.”
“Sure such a pair,” playing into each other's hands, would
make the fortune of a less excellent piece than this.
Miss HELEN Rouse gives the requisite tone to the Countess
of Pangbourne, and Miss Eva MooRE as Lady, Henrietta
Addison, the sweetly capricious Beatrice to the Duke's
Benedick, adds one more portrait to her ery of such
exceptional successes as she has already achieved in Billy's
Little Love Affair, and in Old Heidelberg.
As the sedate Alexander Macbayne, “caretaker of Crag
o' North,” Mr. John KELT has a worthy partner in that
respectable Scotch body Mrs. Macbayne (Miss FLORENCE
HARwooD), the pair being evidently second cousins once
removed, and perched on a Gaelic branch of the family tree,
to Mr. and Mrs. Knapman, now in the service of HENRY ARTHUR
Jones at “the little House in the Haymarket.”
From so perfect a cast must by no means be omitted the
butler, Mr. HoRTON CoopFR, and the footman, Mr. SYDNEY
FENTON. In the Castle scene they play a waiting game to
perfection; each has his entrées and his exits. There are
also two ladies' maids in the play, though unnamed among
the dramatis personae, so that these two very capable young
women are in their places as domestics without characters;
that is, they are not “down in the bill.” I think it as well
to draw the attention of Mr. ARTHUR CHUDLEIGH to this fact,
and, of course, whether he will mention it to either his partner,
Mr. FROHMANN, or to the Manager, Mr. FRANK CURzoN, is a
matter for his own discretion. These two young ladies fill
these small anonymous parts so well that I am sure no
respectable management would wish to take away their
characters, and, that being the case, why not “call them
names’’ instead of waiting until each has made a name for
herself? The stage-management of the play shows the ex-
pert hand of Mr. Dion Boucicault. And so, congratulations
all round !

CHARIVARIA.
THE Rev. A. J. KAYLOR, in the course
of a sermon, in a New York church, on
the subject of Wickedness in that city,
put his arm out of joint while gesticu-
lating, and had to retire. He ought
certainly to have left it to the wicked to
flourish like a green bay tree.
An English schoolboy has won £4,000
at Monte Carlo. It is said that he
intends to purchase his school with a
view to closing it.
Apparently there was some truth in
what was said as to the antiquated
equipment of some of our troops in the
Boer War. It is announced that the
officers of the Dorset Imperial Yeomanry
have decided to present the two guns
which they had with them in South
Africa to the Dorset County Museum.
By some mistake, during prize-firing
at Malta, one of the Venerable's guns,
instead of being directed at the target,
was fired point blank at the Gladiator.
Fortunately the shot passed over her.
Yet there are those who would improve
the marksmanship of the Navy!
The tendency to define the scope of
our places of amusement, as shown in
therecent litigation between the theatres
and the music halls, is still further
exemplified by the hint which the Fire
Committee of the County Council has
É to Drury Lane to see to it that
the Home of Melodrama does not become
the Home of Tragedy.
A gentleman has written to the Pall
Mall Gazette to complain that his chil-
dren's latest game is “Find the Hidden
Treasure.” “My copy of the Encyclo-
poedia Britannica,” he says, “has been
desecrated by the insertion of discs,
my carpets have been torn up, and
no room in the house is sacred to the
hiders and the seekers.” We strongly
recommend Papa to become one of the
former, employing either a birch or a
buckly strap.
A man who was accused at the Man-
sion House of stealing a cheque success-
fully pleaded an alibi, proving that he
was in prison at the time. He left the
Court without a stain on his character.
In Peckham, Dulwich, and Camber-
well there are 404 licensed houses. We

As showing the extreme state of
tension existing between Russia and

And the Russians at Port Arthur are

view of the need which may arise for

Mr. Anthony Hope. I have been
asked to initiate a discussion on a sub-
ject which touches authors keenly.
Musicians, artists, and actors, are
decorated for their work. Why should
novelists be denied this elevating and
stimulating recognition ?
Sir A. Conan Doyle. There seems to
me no question whatever. Sooner or
later such authors as are worthy of
distinction receive it; others do not.
| Those that are thus singled out from
among the ruck are properly grateful.
Sir Gilbert Parker. I agree.
Mr. Anthony Hope. The button of the
Legion of Honour is a meat and pleasant
decoration. Why not adopt it here?
Mr. Henry Harland. Part of us, at
any rate, would then be red.
iſ. Hall Caine. But who should
decide upon the fitting recipients?
Mr. Henry James. That should be
done with exquisite care. The little
badge should instantly blazon its wearer
as one of the minority that is always
right.
Mr. Hall Caine. I was afraid that
some of that cant about small circula-
tions would creep in.
Mr. Guy Boothby. It always does.
There is no better guide to merit than
popularity.
| Sir A. Conan Doyle. Or an édition de

| Mr. Hall Caine. I would suggest
with all humility that a plébiscite of
MUDIE's readers be taken. I am a great
believer in the wisdom of crowds.
Miss Marie Corelli. O yes, yes.
Mr. Kipling. The publishers might
insert a blank page in every book
asking for the reader's opinion as to the
decoration the author deserves. These
papers might be collected from time to
time by a house-to-house visitation.
Sir A. Conan Doyle. But who would
make it?
Mr. Kipling. I have no doubt that an
organisation could be easily perfected.
Perhaps Mr. BRODRICK would assist.
Mr. Henry James. I should not care
for such a test.
Miss Corelli, ſIt would be admirable:
Mr. Hall Cainela most excellent idea.
Mr. Anthony Hope. An equally im-
an author should lose in dignity by
being made a Count of the Holy Roman
Empire. The honour is not one that I
portant point is, What decorations would have sought, but were it conferred upon
you like when the decision is made-
titles or orders ?
Sir Gilbert Parker. I think it must be
conceded that titles are not within the
reach of all. But everyone may aspire
to a decoration.
Mr. Anthony Hope. New orders are
continually being established. Why not
have our own? For example, C.F.P. (Com-
me I should take less than my usual
precautions to have it kept out of the
papers.
Miss Marie Corelli. Decorations seem
to me idle vanities. To find a medallion
entitling one to hidden treasure to the
extent of a farthing is a better way in
which to advertise one's worth.
Mr. Hall Caine. I once read a book
mander of the Fountain Pen); E.T.T. called A Flat-iron for a Farthing.
(Employer of a Thousand Typists);
I.F.A. (Inspirer of the Fulsome Ad.).
Mr. Le Queuz. I like the word Cheva-
lier. It has a romantic ring about it
which banishes all association with th.
sordid actualities of the moment, and
justifies the adoption of a picturesque
costume.
Sir Gilbert Parker. True, costume is
often an incentive to inspiration. I
myself have found a scarlet cummerbund
invaluable in the delineation of tropical
character. But the title Chevalier is not
recognised by Burke, Debrett or Dodd.
Mr. A. E. W. Mason. No novelist can
really do his work properly unless he is
an M.P. That should be the distinction
for which novelists should strive. For
my next book, which is to be called
Godiva of the Hustings, I must have
Parliamentary experience.
Sir Gilbert Parker. I sympathise with
Mr. MASON's aspirations, but I warn him
that Politics is an exacting mistress.
Since I joined the Kitchen Committee
of the House of Commons my literary
Miss Marie Corelli. I do not see that
that remark has any relevance.
Mr. Hall Caine. I am often irrelevant;
but I always sell.
Sir Gilbert Parker. I see that the
Emperor of KoREA has been advertising
for a resident dentist. He will be want-
ing a resident author next. That will
be an opportunity for one of you.
Mr. Harland. Why do you think he
will want an author?
Sir Gilbert Parker. It is a logical pro-
gress. A dentist leads to the study of
the illustrated papers; and from them
we pass to fiction.
Mr. Hall Caine. True, true. How
much does his serene magnificence offer?
Sir Gilbert Parker. He offers the
dentist three hundred yen.
Mr. Hall Caine. What is a yen 2
Sir Gilbert Parker. I don't know, but
no doubt Mr. KIPLING does.
Mr. Kipling. Four shillings.
Mr. Hall Caine. Is that net?
Mr. Kipling. Certainly.
Mr. Hall Caine. O, not enough, not
output has dwindled by 250 words daily. enough. And so far from Greeba!
Mr. Hall Caine. An interesting pro-
blem occurs to me. Ought writers who
habitually employ a pseudonym to
append the decoration to their real or
their assumed name? Or, to take a
concrete case, would our gifted chairman
elect to be known as Lord ANTHONY HoPE,
or as Lord HAWKINS 2
Mr. Harland. Obviously the choice
would be determined by the laws of
euphony. A much more subtle point
is whether ladies who write under a
masculine nom de guerre would be eli-

FRESH FIGURES FROM THE
FIRST TEST MATCH.
[“An enterprising Australian tradesman
advertised an offer to pay any Australian bats-
man who scored 50 runs in either innings of
the first test match a sovereign, and for each
additional run sixpence. A century’ was to
receive five sovereigns extra ; and a sovereign
was to be the price of every catch that dis-
missed an Englishman."]
WHEN NoBLE had made £1 15s. 6d.
he was badly missed at square-leg. He
#. reached his £2. Hill next
ispatched RHODEs to the boundary for
2s. A short run gave HILL another six-
pence, and a lucky snick for eighteen-
pence by NoBLE brought the latter's
score to £2 1s. 6d. Ultimately he
amassed no less than £8 1s. 6d.
TRUMPER is to be congratulated on havin
made £9 7s.6d. not out in the secon
innings.
The Australian fielding was excellent,
NoBLE alone making £3 worth of catches.
A curious misunderstanding arose.
Mr. Foster was under the impression
that the scheme was extended to the
English side. During an interview he
is understood to have told a representa-
tive of the Press that he certainly should
have thought twice about raising his
score to 287 had he been properly
acquainted with the rules. Much sym-
pathy was felt for Mr. Foster, and it
was only by an oversight that no col-
lection was taken for him on the ground.
MANNERS MAKETH BOY.
[“Manners should be the foundation of all
education—of all book-learning and ‘school-
ing' of every description. Qur schoolboys,
instead of being harassed and stupefied with
Euclid and Greek, should be instructed in

Smith. A thousand apologies, my dear

the chapter on Affability for to-morrow's

pain. I was inflicting, although I must
at the same time confess that I was
dimly conscious of the fact that my
left foot was resting on something
which moved about in a manner indica-

Brown. Ah, you are reading the work

THE ENDOWMENT OF RESEARCH.
(A Forecast of the next phase of Philanthropic Journalism.)
Preliminary Announcement in that public-spirited, and
enterprising periodical, “The Sunday Tiddler.”
NExt week we commence our New and Thrilling Serial:
• UP, JENKINS or, UNDER WHICH THIMBLE 2 ”
It will provide the Masses, not only with Bright, Pure, and
Wholesome Fiction, but also with the means of securing
FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS WEEKLY, by following Clues
which ANY CHILD CAN EASILY UNRAVEL!
We do not propose to Bury any Money, as that Plan has
now been very properly condemned as a Public Nuisance.
Our system is Simplicity Itself. It will work as follows:-
On a given day every week our Confidential GOLD-
BEARING 'Adºrs will Secrete Five Medallions, each
entitling the Finder to ONE HUNDRED POUNDS sterling,
in some part of the Garments of FIVE POPULAR CELE-
BRITIES, who (together with the precise portion of their
Attire in which such Medallions have been deposited) will be
indicated by Clues given in the current instalment of ourSerial.
You may ask: “What is to prevent the Celebrities them-
selves from discovering their Medallions and cashing them
first 2" We are going to tell you. ... We have taken Precau-
tions against Sharp Practice or Collusion of this kind.
It is not likely, to begin with, that those we may select as
Depositories for a Medallion will be in the least aware of the
fact. Be that as it may, we shall Cash No Medallion pre-
sented to us by Any Celebrity on whom it has been concealed,
or by any of his Relations, Friends, or Domestics. The
Public can thus rely on having ABSOLUTE FAIR PLAY.
“But might not a Celebrity who discovers that we have
so distinguished him destroy or get rid of his Medallion?”
He will do so At His Peril. These Medallions are the Pro-
perty of The Sunday Tiddler, and our idea is Strictly
Patented. We have the Highest Legal Authority for the
statement that Any Celebrity dealing with one of our Me-
dallions in any way calculated to interfere with the Rights
of our Readers will render himself liable to Criminal Pro-
ceedings! - -
But of course no Celebrity will act in this selfish and
short-sighted manner. He will have Sense enough to see
that we are giving him a FIRST-CLASS ADVERTISE-
MENT, and he will Play the Game by assisting us in the
EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE.
For we need scarcely say that we are actuated by the
Highest Motives. We are not pandering to any morbid
craving for Unearned Riches. We are simply inducing the
Democracy (through the medium of Literature superior in
Style and Quality to Anything yet Produced) to take a more
intelligent interest in the habits and personalities of its Fore-
most Citizens, who are too frequently, alas! Mere Names to
the Man in the Street! So Look out for Chapter I. of “UP,
JENKINS 1" and KEEP YOUR EYE on the DESCRIP-
TIVE CLUES ( !! . . .

From the P-ll M-ll Gazette (ten days later): “So it seems
that our Troglodyte Free Foodlers were just a trifle too
previous in chortling over the little incident at Birmingham
on Monday last! In storming Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's platform
and compelling our only Statesman to escape by a back door
in the disguise of a baker, his audience, as has since been
satisfactorily explained, did not intend, after all, to suggest
that their views on Protection had undergone the slightest
modification. They were merely under an impression that
he was the “Heaven-born Politician’ indicated in a certain
Sunday journal as the involuntary custodian of a £100
medallion, which was understood to have been concealed in
his left coat-tail pocket. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, though much
gratified by learning that the affair had no political signifi-
cance, very properly declines to state whether the inference
drawn by the meeting was correct or otherwise.”
From the W-stm-mst-r Gazette (same date): “General B-D-N
P-W-LL must have fancied himself back once more at Charter-
house in the thick of a football “scrum' yesterday afternoon
in Pall Mall, where, on descending the steps of his Club, he
was surrounded by an enthusiastic mob of admirers, each
endeavouring to be the first to relieve him of his head-gear.
Needless to say, the popular General made a stubborn and
gallant defence, but eventually he had to behold his silk hat,
a new one, snatched from his head and instantaneously
reduced to fragments, However, as soon as the genial
‘B. P.’ was informed that one of The Sunday Tiddler's
£100 medallions had been found secreted in the lining, he
quite understood the situation, and was one of the first to
congratulate the fortunate finder—a chimney sweep, we
understand, of the name of EMANUEL GRIMES.”
From the Ev-n-ng News: “Although we are willing to
admit that the latest development of the “Hidden Treasure’
craze may entail a certain amount of inconvenience in
individual cases, we still think that the Royal Academician,
whose studio in St. John's Wood was so unceremoniously
invaded yesterday afternoon, displayed an irritability quite
out of proportion to the occasion. #. beyond ripping open
one or two canvases on which he was engaged for the Sprin
Exhibitions, his visitors did little appreciable damage, an
to call in the police and give the ringleaders into custody
was surely rather a high-handed proceeding! Does Mr.
BLANK, R.A., at all realise what a godsend even £100 may be
to many of the Unemployed amongst us, and cannot he see
that to be identified by the People as ‘A Mid-Victorian
WELASQUEZ' is no mean compliment—even for an Academi-
cian 2. As a matter of fact, so the proprietor of The Sunday
Tiddler informs us, no medallion was ever secreted in any
canvas, as his agents have the strictest instructions to respect
all private property. Also the Painter really indicated by
the clue was a totally different person. W. cannot but
consider that too much fuss has been made about what was,
after all, a paltry misunderstanding.”
From the St. J-m-s’s Gazette: “It is reassuring to hear that
the P-t L-r-te's injuries are not of so serious a nature as
was at first reported. Still, it must have been sufficiently
upsetting to find oneself, as he did yesterday in Piccadilly,
suddenly pounced upon by a crowd of perfect strangers, and
shaken violently, upside down, for several minutes. They
turned out to be merely ‘Treasure-seekers' who had con-
cluded, from a ‘clue' in one of those serial fictions which
now provide our Middle Classes with their solemental pabulum,
that the unfortunate L-r-te was the ‘Greatest Living English
Poet' down the back of whose neck a £100 medallion had
been surreptitiously inserted. We are bound to say that,
though the search proved fruitless, the crowd bore their
disappointment with considerable good-humour, while Mr.
ALFR-D A-ST-N himself admitted that the mistake was a very
natural one in the circumstances.
Sir L-w-s. M-RR-s left England yesterday afternoon, and
will remain abroad for some time.”
From The Ac-d-my and L-t-r-ţ-re: “We understand that
Mr. PAPSLEY GREwBLL, F.S.A. (author of In Jaeger Clad,
Semolina Plasmon, The Love-ditties of a Vegetarian, and other
works which will probably be remembered by all who have
read them) is the writer of the letter in last Monday's Times,
protesting in indignant terms against the journalistic methods
of The Sunday Tiddler as an outrage on the privacy and
liberty of distinguished literary characters, and complaining
bitterly that he cannot leave his residence at Peckham except
under a strong police escort.” F. A.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
P[CKY BACK.
(Being the Sixth Passage from the reinconanation of Picklock Holes.)
THE STORY OF THE LAMPLIGHTER.
It was evening, a Sunday evening, in Baker Street. The
lamps were nearly all lit, and the intellectual features of the
domestic architecture for which that thoroughfare is cele-
brated were thrown into high relief by the rays emitted
from the tops of the somewhat inartistic lamp-posts that had
lately flashed into sudden life as the swift foot of the lamp-
lighter approached, stopped for a moment, and then rapidly
passed on in his path of duty, looking neither to the right
nor to the left, but, like a true Imperial Briton, ever upward to
higher things. Usually the man went forward alone: none
cared to j. him in a progress so frequently interrupted
by the pauses required by the modern torch-bearer's
employment. But on this particular Sunday evening those
who kept their eyes open might have observed that, as he
passed the house before which stood the twenty-seventh
lamp-post, the front-door swiftly but quietly opened, and
two figures, heavily hatted and cloaked, emerged into the
half-light of Baker Street, and promptly fell into line behind
the unconscious but dutiful employé of the Gas Company.
One of these figures was tall and thin; its muscles seemed
made of steel; it had a pale, thoughtful and ascetic face; its
forehead was high, its sentences were short, and its fingers
were lean, meditative and impressive. At a casual
glance it might have been mistaken for a prosperous under-
taker retired from the active pursuit of business, but still
taking an interest in the mortuary arrangements of his
former rivals in the pall and coffin trade. A second and
more careful look might have convinced the observer that he
saw before him an exiled Emperor, and it would have
required a third and a piercing scrutiny to prove that this
was none other than Picklock Holes. With regard to the
second figure it is only necessary to mention i. it was
addressed by PICKLock Holes occasionally as “friend
Potson,” but more frequently as “Tush' nonsense,” or
“Pooh, absurd.” In fact, not to put too fine a point upon
it, it was me.
You may ask what brought us into Baker Street on the
track of a lamp-lighter on a Sunday evening in mid-
February. The fact is, the town had lately been thrown
into a fever of excitement by a series of extraordinary and
hitherto inexplicable disappearances. All the victims—for
we could not doubt that in some sense they were victims of
somebody—were of the male sex, and what was even more
remarkable they were all grandfathers of an advanced age.
Matters had been brought to a crisis this very morning by
the disappearance of Mr. PICKLOCK Holes's own grandfather
on the mother's side, almost before the eyes of his grandson.
“This,” said Holes, when he realised that his grandsire
was unquestionably gone, “is too much,” and he had at
once thrown himself into the detection of the crime with all
a sleuth-hound's ardour. As a first step he had called upon
me in my Baker Street lodgings, and had spent some hours
in planning out the process by which he intended to convict
the guilty. This was how his argument ran :-
“A grandfather,” he began, “is not exactly like an
ordinary citizen. It may be assumed, I think, that he is no
longer in the first flush of his youth and beauty, and it is
therefore unlikely that a barmaid, for instance, or even a
chorus girl, will have run away with him. By a further
process of elimination we arrive at the conclusion that onl
an Italian marchioness (I spare you the steps by which
reach this point) can have had anything to do with it. But
mark my words—there are at this moment no Italian
marchionesses in London. What then 2 Remove the
marchioness and you leave a void or vacuum. To fill this

CAN'T you see My
in accordance with the preferences of nature you must select

It was at this moment precisely that, dragging me with
him, he dashed out of the front-door and flung himself into
the chase of the lamp-lighter.
Before the next post was reached Holes had closed upon
his prey. In a moment the man was bound and gagged
and hurled into a passing four-wheeler, which immediately
set off on its way to the family mansion lately inhabited by
Mr. Thomas BALTIMORE JUBLEY, Holes's maternal grandparent.
I followed as fast as I could on foot. When I arrived I
witnessed a touching family scene. Old Mr. JUBLEY himself
was standing in the drawing-room warmly embracing Pick-
Lock Holes, who was shaken with an emotion to which he
rarely gave way.
“My boy, my lion-hearted boy,” said Mr. JUBLEY, “you have
found me. How shall I thank you?” Then turning to me
he continued, “I was in bed; I overslept myself, and had
but lately descended when PICKLock arrived.”
After warmly congratulating both gentlemen, I withdrew,
fearing that even so intimate a friend as I was might be
de trop at such a moment.
I ought, perhaps, to mention that we never heard anything
more of the lamp-lighter. Holes had left him by mistake in
the cab, which had driven off before any of us noticed it.
We applied, of course, at the lost property office at Scotland
Yard, but all in vain. The cabman, with a lack of honesty
unusual in his calling, had failed to deposit our lost captive,
and all further trace of him disappeared.
It is confidently asserted that the Japs are “ready to face
the Moujik.”

“TRICKS OF THE BRAIN.”
(Wide the correspondence on Precognition in
the “Daily Mail.”)
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-It is really quite
a common experience to be seeing, hear-
ing, saying, doing, or feeling for the
first time what you think you have seen,
heard, said, done or felt already some
time before. Let me give a few
instances:-
I was walking down Piccadilly for
the first time to-day, and in a normal
state of mind—of course I have traversed
this street before in my life, but what
I want to say is, that § usually go up
and down Piccadilly several times in
the course of the day, but this occasion
was the first of these perambulations—
when I met a great number of people
I didn't know, and all at once it flashed
across me that the same thing had
happened to me at least once before.
I immediately precognised that I was
not recognised.
Again, I encountered BROWN, whose
remarks I may say are rather stereotyped,
on the platform at Victoria the other
day (I run up against him about once
in two years). The moment I saw him I
felt he was going to say, “Well, and
how's the world treating you?” and
no sooner were the words out of his
mouth, than I could have sworn I
had heard him ask the same question
before. How do you explain this extra-
ordinary phenomenon 2
Then as to speech in connection with
tricks of the brain, I was telling Jones
last Monday—I meet him regularly in
the Club smoking-room—my great anec-
dote (about the speech of the Bashful
Bridegroom) which I learnt at school in
’79, and when I had got three-quarters
through I caught a look in his eye
which instantly gave me the impression
that I had told him the story previously.
Was this an hallucination or not? I am
ordinarily most careful to let each person
have it only once, and there are heaps
of people in London still whom I haven't
yet buttonholed for the purpose.
Next, regarding the apparent mental
repetition of an act, just a second ago I
was scratching my head while inditing
these words to you and seeking to frame
my ideas in the most lucid and beautiful
language, and it was borne in upon me
that I was, after all, repeating myself-
whether as to the titillation of the
cranium or the search for expression I
am not quite clear, but it all helps to
prove my point, whatever it is.
Lastly, as to matters of feeling, I
dreamt a few nights i. that I was
flying through a sky full of brickbats
on a pink-eyed octopus pursued by a
Graeco-Roman barrel-organ, a pair of
hard-boiled boxing-gloves, and a feed-
ing-bottle on the hunt for hidden
treasure, when I felt certain that some-
thing was going to happen. Sure
enough, I awoke with a start and found
my alarum in the act of going off.
I could give many further instances for
brain specialists to wrestle with, but at
present will content myself by remaining
Yours supranormally, PSYCHOSIS.

SLEEP mere repose? What! Think

The daily waste of wear and tear?
Perish a thought which speaks so ill

Rest? Nature rests not. Does the sun
Sleep when his daily course is run ?
Do the stars nod, or does the stream
Pause in its ceaseless course to dream?
No, rest is nothing—just a sound
For that which is not to be found,
An idle word, a breath of air,
For rest exists not anywhere.
Then what is sleep? A dispensation
For psychical regeneration,

THE MUD.
(From a Newspaper of the Near Future.)
YESTERDAY several more accidents in
the streets were reported. A gentleman,
who had been riding in the Park, was
passing along Piccadilly when his horse
stumbled at the top of St. James's
Street. To the horror of members
standing at the windows of White's,
Boodle's, and other Clubs, the unfortu-
nate gentleman and his horse were
carried by the current down the hill.
As our readers are aware, the average
depth of the mud in Piccadilly is now
about three feet. Happily the gentle-
man was swept against a pantechnicon
van at the corner of King Street, and
by clinging to it was saved from drown-
ing. His i. was less fortunate, and
perished in Pall Mall.
About eleven o'clock in the morning
an elderly gentleman, who had arrived
by train from the country, and was
unaware of the condition of the Strand,
stepped out briskly from Charing Cross
Station and instantly ºr. A
policeman, with a rope tied round his
waist, gallantly plunged in, and after
heroic efforts, assisted by information
from spectators on the top of an omnibus,
succeeded in finding the old gentleman.
Pluckily grasping his collar, the police-
man held on bravely to the upper.#.
of a lamp-post, and was soon rescued by
some of the station officials mounted on
the roof of a four-wheeled cab. The old
gentleman at first used regrettably
strong language, but after the present
condition of †h. London streets had
been described to him he remarked that
it was different when he was a boy, and
that, though they might call every
infernal vestry a corporation, London
was simply going to the dogs. Then
he i. a rather moist five-pound
note to the policeman, and retired to a
bath-room of the hotel.
Rather earlier in the day some mem-
bers of the Stock Exchange Hidden-
Treasure Hunt, after wading down
Ludgate Hill, with their specially-
trained otter hounds, attempted to pro-
ceed along Fleet Street. They were
rescued with the greatest difficulty,
ropes and life-belts being thrown to
them from the neighbouring houses.
Some of the hounds escaped by swim-
ming into the offices of the Daily
Telegraph. It is needless to point out
the foolhardiness of such attempts.
Although the continued depression in
the City may excuse these efforts to
supplement a greatly diminished in-
come, no, man ought to endanger his
life, or the lives of the local lifeboat-
men, by endeavouring to walk along any
London street. It is true that these
gentlemen believed that it was about the
time of low mud, whereas it was nearly
high mud, when an ordinary cab or
| carriage is almost submerged. Besides,
as the London tides are quite irregular,
and vary in each parish, it is impossible
to compute accurately the time of low
mud.
In the afternoon one of the new lofty
motor-cars, specially constructed to rise
above the mud, was proceeding west-
ward along Piccadilly. The driver, by
some mischance, did not observe the
buoy specially fixed by the Trinity
House on the hoarding at the corner of
Arlington Street, where the roadway is
still being repaired. As it was about
the time of high mud in Piccadilly, and
also a spring tide, the hoarding itself
was of course invisible. The motor-car
dashed into it and became a complete
wreck. The Bond Street slush-escape was
brought out with splendid promptitude,
and the two ladies in the car, as well as
the driver, were happily rescued from a
muddy grave.
THE INNER CIRCLE.
[“A Countess,” writing in The Outlook,
states that nowadays, to the majority of people
in Society, “anything north of Portman Square,
east of Carlton House Terrace, south of Eaton
Square, or west of Prince's Gate is unfashion-
able. Visiting much beyond these confines is
an effort; far beyond, an excursion. There is
a wild west in Earl's Court, and a highly
respectable north above Hyde Park, but they
don't come within the range of practical
society.”]
John SAMUEL SMITH, the plutocrat,
Elite of the élite,
Once occupied a roomy flat
In Upper Bloomsbury Street.
In those far days of lost delight
Two friends he had in town;
The one ELIJAH ToMKINs hight,
The other, HENRY BRowN.
Years sped, and nothing could eclipse
The light of friendship's smile,
Till SMITH, alas! got certain tips,
Plunged deep, and made a pile.
He took a house in “Kaffir Lane,”
The smartest he could find,
And, pulverising friendship's chain,
Left both his chums behind.
He had, it must be understood,
No wish to prove untrue;
For BRowN had said the tips were good,
And ToMKINs helped him through.
And even BRowN and ToMKINs thought
He'd done the proper thing,
Until they found their friend was caught
Within the fatal ring.
So now, Fair Fortune's pampered child,
SMITH dwells in lonely state,
For TomKINs hugs the howling wild
Just west of Prince's Gate;
No longer can he sally forth
To BRowN's suburban lair,
For that lies in the dismal north,
Two doors from Portman Square.
THE TORTURE.
THE braves bore out the strong,
courageous man from the wigwam.
Without flinching he had endured every
refinement of torture to which his callous
captors had been able to subject him.
He had suffered his eyes to be plucked
out, his nose to be cut off, his every
tooth to be drawn; yet no word had he
breathed which would betray the where-
abouts of his comrades. His feet had
been placed against hot irons, he had
been cut with knives, his scalp was
gone; yet he made no sign.
Then he had been borne forth and
chained upright to a tree. But no
muscle moved. The strong man was
still “captain of his soul.” When
he had been bound, the braves drew
together in earnest conclave. How was
this mute Paleface to be compelled to
speak, to reveal what he knew?
“Cut off his arm,” said one.
“His legs,” said another.
Then a grey, wizened old chieftain
who, until now, had been silent, drew
near. A hush came over the assembly
as it observed that he would speak.
The old man knew that his reputation
as a refiner of cruelties was at stake;
never before had anyone been proof
against his hideous arts.
But now he felt that he had met a
new kind of man. He must rise to the
utmost of his powers or fail utterly.
| “Braves,” he cried. “The Paleface
has resisted every torture. Neither loss
of limb, loss of sight, burnings or
|brandings have icºi him. But there
is one thing yet may be done.”
He paused significantly, and an ex-
pectant thrill went through the assem-
bly as it marked that even the old chief
himself seemed to shrink from naming
the last dread alternative. Then, while
his dusky audience was aching with the
tension, he went on:-
“Let some brave come forward and
let him draw near to the ear of the
|Paleface. And then let the brave—let
him—let—him—sing ‘Hiawatha!”
. A piercing shriek of anguish rent the
air. The prisoner had overheard.
“No! no! no! Not that! Oh, spare
me that,” he cried. “I will tell you all,
all, all—but spare me that!”
Then his voice failed, and the braves
looking saw that in his terror he had
swooned away. The old chief turned
to the others. There was a light of
triumph in his eye. “That will draw
him, when he comes to,” he said.
It is hoped that the Duke of Portland
may see his way to lecture before the
combined members of the London Mis-
sionary Society and the Jockey Club on
the subject: “Tibet or not Tibet.”

occasionally indulging in certain expressions of strong
sectarian feeling, utterly out of place in such a work, and
very foreign to the generous spirit of the Rev. RICHARD
BARHAM, who had a sincerereverence for all that men of various
opinions hold sacred, while unable to restrain himself from
persistently seeing the burlesque side of pious legends, and
expressing it in eccentric, jingling, rhythmical verse. With
the Rev. FRANK MAHONY (“ #. PROUT,”) the sweet singer of
Irish verse, admirable classic and finished scholar, Richard
BARHAM shared the mantle of Rabelaisian humour, unequally
divided between the pair of them, PROUT coming in for the
larger part of the roguish old Canon's robe, and both habits
being cleaned, scoured, sweet-scented, and cut to suit the
fashion of the day. However, Mr. HARPER's book is a most
leasant guide to the Isles of Sheppey and Thanet, and to the
unty .#. from Canterbury to Rye, as well it should be,
seeing that Mr. HARPER has been harping on such themes for
many years, and has given to the travelling world books
descriptive of the Brighton Road, the Portsmouth Road, the
Dover Road, and some eight or nine other roads, so that, in
this line of business, he has well earned for himself the title
of The Colossus of Roads. Pleasant it is for the students of
Ingoldsby to identify the haunts of The Spectre of Tºpping:
ton, to regard with awe the “take off” of the Smuggler's Leap
(BARHAM excelled in any “take off”), to visit the tomb of
Sir Robert DE SHURLAND, and finally to dump down at
Margate, and, in company with Ingoldsby, to go upon the
pier, and meet “the little vulgar boy,” and ask “what do
you here?” When summer-time arrives, an Ingoldsby tour
with this work for a guide would give a good week's outing
with a genial companion.
Most persons who may happen to be acquainted with the
now quite-out-of-date expression, “old codger,” would spell,
it as it is here set down, and as it was spelt by GEORGE
CoLMAN the Younger in Knight and Friar (1804), where he
rhymes “codger” with “Roger,” and as, probably, some
twenty years later, did his clever clerical imitator RICHARD !

the foregoing paragraph, though at this moment the Baron
fails to recall an instance of it. Now it appears that

["Everybody was surprised the other day to learn that there were
3000 Boers in Cuba, but it appears there was a mistake in reckoning.
The number is not 3000; it is 3!”—Westminster Gazette.]
THE friends of Mr. RAPHAEL LUNY, the poet, were astonished
to learn that 51,000 copies of his latest book of verse, Ulula-
tions from the Uvula, had been sold. On inquiring at the
publisher's it was discovered that the initial figure as well
as two of the noughts had crept in by mistake.
The proprietor of the Half-penny Handglass was much
distressed recently by the announcement that the circula-
tion of the Daily Medallion had gone up to 300. It should,
of course, have been 3,000,000.
The allegation that the Duke of DEvoNSHIRE recently went
round the Chatsworth links in 19 strokes has elicited an
explanation from the noble amateur. The correct number
is not 19 but 190.
The statement that the English cricketers dropped 14 catches
in a recent match was ºi inaccurate. They dropped 13.
No one who has ever heard him sing can fail to have been
astounded by the statement that, at a recent concert, Signor
BELLO BELLo's “vocal chords were received with rapture.”
What the critic really wrote was that his “vocal cords
received a rupture.”
Cap'n Tommy Bowles.
TrE Daily News remarks that the popular conception of
Mr. Bowles as possessing only one arm arises from the cari-
catures in Punch, which picture him as Cap'n Cuttle. “As
a matter of fact,” says the Daily News, “the honourable
Member's limbs are normal.” A correspondent points out
that the gallant gentleman is himself largely responsible for
the error, since he commonly represents himself as single-
handed and doing all his work with a single eye.

|Appalling Encounter occurs, may we be
A SOIREE AT OLYMPIA.
It was indeed a Graeco-Roman evening,
or rather, a Terrible-Greeko-Turko-
Russian gathering, with a very strong
flavouring of most other nationalities
thrown in, with the accent on the
thrown. We had a Graeco-Roman time
of it, getting into the huge building,
while seven thousand other competitors
were endeavouring, pretty well simul-
taneously, to shove-in-as-shove-can.
However, once inside the arena under
the genial direction of the American
manager, Mr. CHARLEs, S. WELLs, we
were enabled to secure front seats, with
plenty of elbow-room and no “half-
nelsons.” Then, under the glare of
thirty arc lights touching one another
in a row half round the “ring”—which
was an elevated square with sloping
carpeted sides for wrestlers who couldn't
help it to toboggan down—we sat in
comfort and marvelled.
First the troupe of the Terrible Greek,
ANTONIO PIERRI, took the floor at eight
o'clock. The Alarming Spaniard,
| CHORELLA, after a spill-and-tumble of
eighteen minutes' duration, beat the
Bewildering Belgian, LE MEUNIER. For
part of the time the latter was teetotum-
ing on his head, walking like a wheel-
barrow on his hands, or wiping the
perspiration off his brow on the
Spaniard's back. The next bout was
between two Formidable Englishmen,
J. WhistLER and T. BARKER, who caught-
as-catch-could until the former upset his
opponent in about nine minutes; where-
upon CARROLL the Dreadful and FourNIER
the Fearsome had a “fall” (which was
no fall, but ended in an entente cordiale)
for the space of ten minutes.
Then came the event of the evening.
Mr. FRANK GLENISTER proclaimed with a
megafunnel to the four corners of the
earth that between the Terrible Turk
MADRALI and the Leonine Russian
HACKENSCHMIDT there were to be three
bouts, and no “rolling fall” would be
allowed, but only a “fair pin fall.”
True enough, you could have heard a
pin fall in the breathless silence of
expectation ere the arrival of the Two

The gifts that Heaven on Man bestows
Are more than at first he might suppose;
Myself I hadn't included Mars
Among my various natal stars,
But always imagined I had to cope
With a merely civilian horoscope.
Early I found that I could pitch ..
Better than most in a bunkered ditch;
Early I saw my powers cut out
For dealing with Philosophic Doubt:
But I shouldn't have said I was fashioned for
The perilous post of a Lord of War.
It came but lately within my ken
That I was a natural Leader of Men;
Still later I found that I was made
Expressly to probe the laws of Trade:
But I never surmised by the inward sense
My singular talent for Home Defence.
It's true I had shown that mounted forces
Might be crippled for want of horses,
But nobody guessed from that one fact,
Proof though it was of martial tact,
That I could assume the nation's sword
As an ex officio First War Lord.
Duties of so select a kind -
I always approach with an open mind:
For matters there are of grave concern
Which even a layman has got to learn;
Nobody—not the purest dunce-
Has settled convictions all at once.
I needed to know from coloured types
The rules that govern a non-com.'s stripes;
To learn what difference lay between
A bombardier and a horse-marine;
And whether your chest or the small of your back
Was the usual site for a haversack.
So, in the intervals hard to steal
From the business of doing a fiscal deal,
I take my satchel in hand and go
To an Army Coach for an hour or so,
And shape myself to a warrior's mould,
Cramming as much as I can hold.
I sit at my meals imbibing lore
From WINSTON's works on the Art of War;
From Uncle Toby I grow expert in
Fossé and counterscarp and curtin;
And, when my energy droops, I twitch it
With Fights for the Flag, by the Reverend FITCHETT.
So much for theory. Next, my plan
Involves the career of a Fighting Man.
I mean to encourage the present war-stir,
Going one better than ARNOLD-ForsTER;
Risky, I grant, it may appear,
But I think of becoming a Volunteer!
Already my heart conceives a hottish
Passion to 'list in the London Scottish;
And, if my serpentine length of leg
Looks out of place in a phillibeg,
I purpose to pass, in a few brief moons,
Into the Westminster Dragoons.

in producing imitations. The following literary items j
be of general interest:-
Mr. CLARK RUSSELL has taken a pipe belonging to one of
the water companies, where he will shortly ...: a stirring
romance of the main. -
Mr. MAXIM. GoRKY is in treaty for a Very Much Lower
Depth somewhere in the Caucasus, to be approached by a
flight of Steppes.
Mr. Guy BoothBY has leased a coal pit so as to counteract
his tendency to soar above the heads of the British Public.
Mr. HENRY JAMES has secured a disused shaft for the
purpose of greater Obscurity.
Mr. ALLEN UPwARD (who is expected, in the circumstances,
to adopt a pseudonym) hopes to acquire the basements of a
couple of oubliettes, under the palaces respectively of Kin
PETER of Servia and the Prince of MonACO. Here he wil
pursue his investigations into the “Secrets of the Courts of
Europe.”
Mr. CROCKETT has taken a small abyss for the Spring
Season, and looks forward to completing a new story with
more than usual precipitation.
It is hoped that the difficulties experienced in the South
African Deep Level Labour Market may yet be met by the
importation of some myriads of miner poets from the Mother
Country. -
The Metropolitan Railway is shortly to tempt young
authors with season tickets at reduced rates, including
guarantee of a fixed circulation. The Company is also
prepared to hear from authors desirous of taking up a con-
tinued residence in the tunnels. Amateur Versifiers are
invited to compare the Company's evenly flowing lines with
their own. And to all writers suffering from the fickleness
of the public the Company says:
TRY OUR PERMANENT WAY.
ABANDONED.
GooDBYE, dear, goodbye! Though it's always delightful
To live in your mild and magnificent eye;
Though I pine when we're parted, this weather's too
frightful;
So I've made up my mind I must bid you goodbye.
You must stay, dear; your duty demands it: you're never
A rebel when duty requires you to stay.

You'll be flooded and fogged, but I know you'll obey.
And I from our limitless lake-land near Marlow,
Where the Thames runs as high as a river can run,
Like a swallow in autumn shall seek Monte Carlo,
And watch the blue wavelets and bask in the sun.
And, oh, if at home, dear, you faint not nor slumber,
If your course and our interests you straitly pursue,
I'll put a small stake on your favourite number,
And invest the result in a present for you. -

much inclined to turn out of an evening, even to enjoy the
Society's productions. And if it came to that, how many of
them had their Chairman attended ?
The Chairman said that was his affair. A man in his
position had his evenings pretty full—especially during the
Season. He could assure them it was a continual hurry from
one Society crush to another. Besides, he was obliged to
drop in on the un-intellectual Drama now and then—just to
keep his eye on it.
A Lady Novelist thought people would go more regularly
if they could see our leading actors and actresses taking part
in the Society's performances. She would, for one. Several
of them were members, why were they not invited to give
their services?
A Popular Actor said all the parts with any “fat” in them
were allotted to the Training School pupils, and he could
hardly be expected to play subordinate characters in six
different dramas every week for such remuneration, as
the Society seemed to think sufficient. He was willing
to make intº any sacrifice to preserve the Drama—but,
naturally, his wife and family came first. He didn't think
it was the acting that kept people away. It was not at
all bad, considering. Indeed, his old friend and manager,
Mr. Fitzroy Flair, a most enthusiastic supporter of the
Society, had considered some of its pupils so promising
that he had actually given them engagements to “walk on ”
at his own theatre! (Cheers.) No, it wasn't the acting—
it was the pieces they put on. They might be classics–
work. As they were unable to guarantee him more than a
month's run of two nights a week, it was obvious that any
percentages he might receive would be less than he could
count upon from any West-End house. But he did not
mind that—the honour and glory of a production under
the auspices of such a Society as theirs would have more
than compensated him. (Applause.) He didn't “back out,”
as the Chairman called it, till he saw the lady and gen-
tleman whom the Committee insisted on casting for his
heroine and hero.
A Member of the Committee said perhaps the last speaker
was not aware that they were their two very best pupils,
and had each taken the Society's Silver Medal for Earnestness
and Intelligence.
The B. B. Dramatist said what he objected to was that
the gentleman, besides being undersized, was a trifle uncer-
tain about his “h”s, while the lady, who he admitted was
a competent elocutionist, suffered under the disadvantage
of a marked visual obliquity. All his characters were
titled people, and he could not think that either pupil
would quite look the part.
A Leading Manager said that didn't matter a straw so
long as they could act it. Any capable actor could, by
sheer histrionic ability, sink his identity, and give life to
characters seemingly opposed to his personality. (Applause.)
A Dramatic Poet said he did not mind who acted his play,
so long as it was acted. There was a little thing of his
own, a blank verse Tragedy in a Prologue and Five Acts,
but they were good old chestnuts, every one of them || which, for the sake of resuscitating the British Drama, he

uce such a work to the stage.
An Accomplished Critic said there was only one objection
—the play in question was a Trilogy in Nineteen Acts, and
a hundred and thirty scenes, and was intended for mental
performance only, .not for the stage.
An Earnest Literary Lady said surel
plays of that kind that their Society had
produce.
A Cosmopolitan Composer suggested that there were several
unacted masterpieces by ECHEGARAY, MAETERLINCK, and GoRKY,
which were admirably suited for the education of the British
Playgoer.
A Gallant General said he didn't know much about such
things, but he rather fancied that none of the gentlemen
who had just been mentioned were what you might call
British Dramatists, exactly, eh?
The Previous Speaker said that was so, and the more
shame to the British Drama that it should be For his
own part, he never went to any play that wasn't written
by a foreigner.
A Broad-minded Bishop said he could not go quite so
far as his friend who had just sat down. A play might be
English, and yet have much that was good in it. Their
Society included more than one—er—fairly brilliant British
Dramatist. Why not commission one of them to write a
play for their purposes? It must be a moral play, of course.
The Chairman intimated that one of such members had
already been approached, and had actually promised them
a comedy. But for some reason or other he had backed
out at the last moment. (Cries of “Shame!” and “Name !”)
A Brilliant British Dramatist said he supposed the

Chairman meant him. He would tell them exactly how
it was : The Comedy he had sent the Committee had cost
him eighteen months' hard labour—(“Oh, oh!”)—he meant
condition of things. He really believed he had succeeded
at last. (Applause.) Perhaps some of his ideas might seem
rather revolutionary at first—but anyway, he would tell
them the conclusions he had arrived at. The ideal Play
should be original in form (applause); it should not be too
to rejuvenate the British Stage, and bring about a healthier
long. (Some dissent.) . Well, really, some of the Society's
productions had struck him as rather long! (Renewed dissent.)
Then, he thought the Plot should be not too involved—in
fact, he wasn't sure that it might not be dispensed with
altogether. The Scenery should be simple—only one scene
for each Act—but that one beautiful and harmonious in
colour, like the costumes. Next, the story should be illus-
trated from time to time by Songs and Dances. (Murmurs.)
Why not?, What was the use of teaching their pupils
singing and dancing if they were to have no opportunities
of exhibiting these accomplishments? Lastly, he would
introduce a Chorus, somewhat after the old Greek fashion,
only with this difference—his Chorus should always be of
the gentler sex, and of comely appearance—the older he got,
the fonder he was of seeing young and pretty faces about
him. (Interruption.) As for the story, that was of minor
importance, the one essential was to have something bright

THE PURSUIT OF PERIPHRASIS.
HINTS To YoUNG AUTHORs.
No literary vice is more calculated to
make the judicious grieve than that of
repetition; none, on the other] hand,
within certain limits, is easier of avoid-
ance. For example, if you have men-
tioned Berlin in one line and are obliged
to refer to that capital in the next sen-
tence or paragraph, it is easy enough to
obviate the monotony of bald repetition
by some such synonym as “Athens on
the Spree.” Similarly, if it is desirable
to evade a second use of the name
Bacchus, one can always substitute
some artistic phrase such as “the pagan
deity who was neither . Mealer nor
Teetotaller.” If it be objected that
some of our most eminent authors
have lent the weight of their authority
to the contrary view, e.g., SHAKSPEARE,
who is responsible for such solecisms as
“To be or not to be,” instead of saying
“not to exist,” it cannot be too strongly
emphasised that between SHAKSPEARE
and modern journalism a wide gulf is
fixed; and that whatever merits the
| Swan of Avon may have possessed, he
would never have made his mark as a
leader writer, or even a high-class
descriptive reporter.
But periphrasis, like all fine arts, is
not to be mastered in a moment. I have
given one or two instances in which the --- -
phrase leaps to the pen. But in the -º-º-º-º-º-º-
higher walks of modern journalism, in -
which the personal note is so persistently
sounded, it is not everyone who can
devise a really choice and up-to-date
circumlocution. In such a case precept
is useless unless reinforced by concrete
examples, and I propose to illustrate the
true and artistic method of dealing with
this problem by a few specimens of
illuminating periphrasis which may
serve as models to the aspiring scribe.

LITERARY AND MISCELLANEOUS PERIPHRASIS.
It is, perhaps, in the department of
art, pastime, the drama, above all letters,
that the widest scope for the display of
this delicate accomplishment is found.
Mr. SARGENT may be transformed into
“The GREVILLE of the Brush,” or “The
Debrett Scarifier.” Sometimes again
the best results may be attained by a
severe and chaste simplicity, as when
Mr. C. B. FRY is styled “The English
RANJITsINHJI,” and Prince RANJITSINHJI
“The Indian FRY.” The claims of
Lemprière are satisfied by applying the
imaginative metaphor, “The Achilles of
Old Trafford,” to Mr. A. C. MACLAREN.
Turning, as one naturally does, from
cricket to the footlights, do not fail to
note as suitable phrases for Mr. BEERBOHM
TREE “The Mikado of Mummers,” or
“The Great Japanjandrum of the Stage,”
while if repeated reference to Mons.
WALKLEY be necessary “The mobilised
MEzzoFANTI” should meet the case. Where
omniscience is the theme, periphrasis
becomes a pleasure. Thus Mr. ANDREW
LANG's Protean versatility suggests in
rapid succession “The Merry. One,”
“The Ency. Brit. of St. Andrew's,”
“The Old Humourist,” or (in a psychical
context) “The un-canny Scot.” For
Mr. HENRY JAMEs “The Lycophron of
Rye” or “The Cinque Ports Cuttlefish.”
may be confidently recommended, while
Lord Avebury's literary, financial and
apiarian interests are neatly hit off in
“The City Centlivre” or “The MAETER-
LINCK of Lombard Street.” With the
Poet Laureate, as with Mr. LANG, the
difficulty is not that of creating but of
choosing. Some of the happiest euphe-
misms that have occurred to me are
“The T us of the Alhambra,”
“The Grand Old Gardener that we
love,” “The Swinford Old Manorist”
and “The Paid Piper of Windsor.”
Lastly, the gifted and generous writer
whose residence has cast a fresh lustre
on SHAKSPEARE's birthplace may be suit-
ably described as “The new ANNE HATH-
Away,” or “The ANNIE S. Swan of Avon.”
FUR-COAT FASHIONS.
(By the Expert Wrinkler.)
REQUESTs for advice regarding the
care of fur coats are so numerous, that,
as a gentleman, I can no longer post-
pone my reply. To begin with, the
commonest ailment to which the fur coat
is addicted is, perhaps, baldness. For
this I recommend the frequent applica-
tion of Tatcho or some other equally
efficacious capillary restorative. Better
still, however, is it to take time by the
fetlock and prevent the disease. As
to the best antiseptics, opinions differ.
My man makes an excellent mixture of
assafoetida and cayenne pepper, sulphur
and green tea, which he burns in a

small brazier practically continuously
through July and August, when moths'
appetites are at their sharpest. Old
cigar-ends steeped in resin are also
useful. My grandmother had an old-
fashioned country recipe for preserving
tippets and muffs. It consisted of
powdered toadstools, fir-cones, and the
legs and tails of fieldmice, all worked up
into a paste with paraffin and ignited in
the fur closet. No moth could survive it.
THE CURE OF MoULTING.
Moulting is a calamity to which allfur
coats, even the best cared for, are liable.
When the attack comes on the best course
is, perhaps, to consult a Wet., but home
treatment is possible too. I attribute my
own success with fur coats to a conversa-
tion I once had some years ago with
| JAMRACH, in which I received some
priceless hints. Ever since then I have
kept JAMRACH's ointments at hand, all
ready to apply in case any of my coats
throw out signals of distress. For the
Polar bear I use nitro-glycerine; for
astrachan, cream of tartar; for sable,
anchovy paste; for chinchilla, Elliman's
embrocation; and for mink, golden
syrup.
A CoMPLETE FUR OUTFIT.

The reader may gather from the fore-
going remarks that I have too many fur
recommend with the utmost confidence,
is to be #. partly by the thermo-
meter, and partly by the nature of my
. For example, if I am
ng on avery cold dayatahouse which
I specially desire to honour, I don the
Polar bear. On an equally cold day,
in less influential company, the leopard
suits my purpose. For the opera, my
lion-skin Chesterfield; for musical
comedy, my zebra Raglan; for the
antomime, my marmoset covert-coat.
y mole-skin aquascutum I reserve
exclusively for travelling in the Tube,
while for motoring I have had built a
special crocodile skin Newmarket, lined
with a judicious blend of ermine, lambs-
wool and eiderdown. Between the outer
and inner lining there is a water-tight
compartment, which can be filled with
hot water whenever the temperature
falls below freezing point.
Nothing is so misguided as to restrict
the use of fur to one garment. In
winter one should present a symphony
in fur. For instance, when I am
patronising the Polar bear, I wear also
reindeer mocassins, tiger-skin spats,
python puttees, seal-skin knickers, a hair
shirt, eel-skin braces, and a beaver
hat. I may add that, in order to pre-
pare himself for the custody of my
sartorial menagerie, my man spent some
weeks under the late Mr. BARTLETT as an
underkeeper at the Zoo.
THE FUR CoAT IN THE OFF-SEASON.
The fur coat, when not in use—that
is to say, in the milder days of winter
or in the summer months—may be
employed in other ways. I have known
a fur coat become quite a steady wage-
earner for its master by being rented to a
photographer for the use of his clients.
Another fur coat of my acquaintance
lent an illusion of prosperity to a thea-
trical manager on the brink of disaster
(at half a guinea a week). But not every-
one cares to see his garments worn by
another. To these off-season uses
would add that the fur coat makes an

| Indications of extent and direction found
in both Houses on this our opening day.
In the Lords County GUY, strolling in
only a few minutes late, passed the
| Front Bench where late he sat as
Leader, and dropped into corner seat on
front bench below Gangway. In the
Commons AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer, stood by the
brass-bound box, spokesman of the
Conservative Ministry, defending “my
right hon. friend the Member for Bir-
mingham ” from the base attack of
truculent C.-B.
Here at this very spot, eleven years
ago come next April, stood Mr. GLADSTONE
hailing the new-born morn with passion-
ate pleading for his Home Rule Bill.
In the midst of the crisis, on the eve of
the Division, with no man sure what an
hour might bring forth, the chivalrous
veteran reined in his horse and lowered
his lance in salute to the son of his
| ablest, relentless foeman.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, not then dream-
ing of Chancellorships of the Exchequer,
his furthest view modestly bounded by
possibility, in some far-off day, of a
Junior Lordship of the Treasury, had
made his maiden speech. Of course it
was against the war-worn chieftain's
cherished Bill. What it could do in the
way of riving it was done smartly.
Recognising talent, remembering former
. Ch-pl-n and Sir Edw-n D-rm-ng-L-wr-nce.)
Here we are again, as used to be said
at old Drury in Christmas-time. Eleven
ears have passed, the whole Eleven
i.i.d out by Time. And behold the
scene to-night. A slim, straight, youth-
ful figure stands by the Box in bygone
days battered by the vigorous palm of a
great orator. Last Autumn the proud
and pleased father, having plunged the
Cabinet into dire perplexity, humbly
fared forth, taking on himself once more
the vesture of the private Member. To-
night his orchid gleams from the very
seat below the Gangway whence, eleven
years ago, he bowed his head in almost
reverential acknowledgment of his old
captain's courtesy to the boy – the
boy now a man, in the very prime of
life, Privy Councillor, Chancellor of the
Exchequer, successor to Pitt, PEEL,
GLADSTONE, DISRAELI, who, not puffed up
with pride, mindful of past favours,
takes under his protection “my right
hon. friend the Member for Birming-
ham,” letting whom it may concern
know that those who strike at him will
smite the shield of his son.
The Lords also had their personal
dramas beyond the passing of County
Guy skirting the Ministerial Bench with
thankful thought that no more for him
will be necessity for seeking his place
sharp on the hour of the meeting of the
House, no more need of sitting out long
speeches by prosy Peers.
For thirty-five years there has been in
the House of Lords a Marquis of SALIS-
BURY on the front bench, either to right
or left of the Woolsack. Under what-
ever circumstances he presented himself
he was the predominant figure of the
hour. Of late years, whilst he sat on
the Ministerial bench, with chin sunk
on his breast, fists dug into the cushion
in support of a tired and drowsy body,
he was still the centre of interest. At
any moment he might wake up and
plunge into debate, his lambent wit
scorching some hapless Peer, not neces-
sarily selected from the ranks of the
Opposition. AMURATH to AMURATH suc-
ceeds. The MARKiss is dead; long live
the MARQUIs. ...To-night he came up and
signed the roll of Parliament, taking his
seat near his father's old place in his
new capacity as Lord Privy Seal.
Il y a fagots et fagots.
“And there are Marquises and Mar-
quises,” said the MEMBER FOR SARK.
“Since we are dropping into foreign
languages, perhaps I may add there is
also longo intervallo.”
On a night saddened by the illness
and absence of PRINCE ARTHUR one other
touching episode struck the eye and
will dwell in the memory till death do
us part. When Parliament prorogued,
Lord BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH occupied an
appreciable space on the Ministerial
Bench. He was Secretary of State for
Scotland, and an uncommonly good one
too. Then came the dramatic series of
alarums and excursions from the Cabinet
chamber in Downing Street. Under
“KING CHARLEs's HEAD, MR. SPEAKER!”
“I noticed 'a perpetual endeavour and an
earnest desire under all circumstances, at all
times, to bring in somehow or other King
Charles the First's head—the ex-Secretary of
State's head—and to present it on a charger
for the repudiation and the derision of the
House.”—Mr. Chamberlain.

surprise, but highly honourable to him,
B. of B. found himself out of office,
he and County Guy walking hand in
hand, like Babes in the Wood, with a
vague but unmistakable conviction that
somewhere about was a Wicked Uncle.
Where would the ex-Secretary for Scot-
land sit under the new circumstances?
It seemed probable that, having pre-
ceded County Guy in leaving the Cabinet
he would follow him to his new quarters
below the Gangway. The LoRD CHAN-
CELLOR took his seat; business was
entered upon, speeches were made.
“He cometh not,” said County GUY.
Suddenly the curious eye, wandering
round the crowded Ministerial Benches,
| lighted upon BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH
throned among the Bishops! To-night
he wore layman's attire. But what with
the subtle force of saintly companion-
ship, what with spare surplices hanging
round in the robing room, who shall say
what the morrow may not bring forth?
Meanwhile BALFour of BURLEigh has
fled to sanctuary, sitting among the
Bishops with complacent confidence
that if there is any fresh manoeuvring
in Cabinet circles it cannot in his new
surrounding affect him.

Parliament with Royal pomp and
ceremony.
Friday night.—Through the week
Parliament has sat on four days. This
Diary, which purports to cover the full
period, is, as the keen-sighted reader
will observe, confined to a single entry.
The circumstance seems to require
explanation, but no apology—at least,
from me.
I do not, this week, describe or com-
ment upon proceedings in the House of
Commons for reasons analogous to those
which, on a historic occasion, prevented
the Spanish Fleet being descried. The
Spanish Fleet “was not yet in sight,”
and the doors of the Press Gallery having,
by order, been closed against me, I have
not passed them.
The whole story has an archaic, musty
flavour pungent in the nostrils of the
so-called Twentieth Century. Man and
boy I have for thirty-two years had my
box in the front row of the Press
Gallery. For more than twenty years
I, by favour of the constituency of
Barks—that is to say, of the English-
speaking race whose area is encompassed
by Mr. Punch’s “far-flung battle-line”
racy, recorded Parliamentary events on
this page. But opportunity was not
derived from the renown or position
of my esteemed Master. Mr. Punch's
Chronicler has no locus standi in the
Press Gallery. It was by connection
with a long-established London morning
paper that entrance was permitted. It
happens this Session that that particular
section of the Chronicler's services has
been transferred to another London daily
paper of modern birth, a vigorous infant
with a daily circulation exceeding
600,000.
Nominally admission to the Press
Gallery is within the province of the
SPEAKER. Actually the department is
administered by the Sergeant-at-Arms.
And the Sergeant-at-Arms courteously
but relentlessly refuses to recognise the
existence of this 600,000-pounder even
to the extent of issuing for its service a
single Gallery ticket.
The reason alleged is that there is
“no room.” Last Session it happened
that two of the older London morning
papers dispensed with the services of
their reporting staff, thus clearing out
of the Gallery an aggregate of fourteen
gentlemen. Have #. empty places
been filled up? If so, how? If not,
what becomes of the plea of no room?
The fact is, the whole relations of the
Press and Parliament are tainted with
the arbitrary conditions that marked
them at an epoch when the freedom of
the people was at its lowest ebb. To
this day there stands in the Order Book
a provision which makes it a high crime
and misdemeanour for any newspaper to
report Parliamentary proceedings. The
enactment is a dead letter; but its spirit
is not laid.
The London Press, being perhaps the
most decently mannered, certainly the
most impeccable, in the world, is also
the most powerful. Yet it meekly
suffers a condition of things that would
not be permitted to exist for a week
in the relations of the local press with
a Town Council or Parish Westry. The
Sergeant-at-Arms is animated by no
other motive than desire impartially
to administer the business remitted
to him by ancient usage. This he
does with a courtesy that disarms re-
sentment in individual hard cases. But,
naturally, he knows little or nothing
of the relative positions of the Daily
Papers. The consequence is that the
avowed desire of giving fair representa-
tion to the Press is even grotesquely
frustrated. One journal has at its exclu-
sive disposal three Boxes and admission
for over a dozen reporters. Others
have two Boxes and a proportionate
number of tickets. Whilst a paper
supplying the Parliamentary needs of
a public wider than the aggregate circu-

put together, is denied the privilege of admission for a
single representative.
The House of Commons is slow to lay reforming hand on
the Ark of its procedure. Within the last ten years it has,
under sheer compulsion, applied itself to the task with the
happiest results. It is time the anachronism of the super-
vision of the Press Gallery was dealt with through the
machinery of a Select Committee.
Meanwhile, as far as I am personally concerned, the
restriction that governs the chronicle this week will hence-
forward be inoperative. When the circumstances became
known, Toby, M.P. was overwhelmed with proffers from all
parts of the House, not excepting the Treasury Bench, of
good offices, Members placing at his disposal their personal
privilege of obtaining admission for a “Stranger.” For this
demonstration of friendliness to a
written by Mr. CHARLEs GEAKE, and most .# illustrated
by F. C. G., delights persons of all shades of politics possess-
ing any particle of humour. In some few instances the
parodying artist has so exactly reproduced the spirit and
the lines of the original, as, at a first glance, to deceive even
those most intimately acquainted with Sir John TENNIEL's
immortal work.
In Max PEMBERTON's latest sensational novel, Red Morn
(CASSELL & Co.), a sister is determined to avenge her
brother's murder, if murdered he was, which has to be
proved. That a man should be shot in a duel which he
himself has provoked can hardly be considered in the light
of murder, where the adversaries are equally skilled in the
use of their weapons. The cleverness of this novel is in the
devising of the strange characters

his thanks.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A Criminal Croesus, by GEORGE |
GRIFFITH (John LONG), is a genuine
romance, smacking of JULES WERNE
and BULWER LYTTON at their best,
and unsurpassed, as a work of
imagination, by any work of either
of the above-mentioned authors
that the Baron can at present call
to mind, except perhaps Twenty
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,
and The Coming Race. The plausi-
bility of the probabilities in the
story is so convincing that any
reader would not be surprised to
find some extract from a daily
paper confirming the most startling
events and dramatic situations as
they are described in this novel.

Mr. AUSTN Dobson has the precious gift of writing in the
simple style of good talk. Reading Fanny Burney, the latest
contribution to “English Men of Letters” (MACMILLAN), my
Baronite has the pleased feeling of being seated in an easy
chair, with a companionable cigar, listening to the scholarly
chat of one who knew everybody worth knowing when
GEORGE THE THIRD was King. In a volume of moderate size,
and alluringly cheap price, Mr. Dobson presents a charming
picture not only of the author of Evelina but of *
entourage. Not led away by habit of hero-worship, he
resents to the student of literature a valuable judgment on
ANNY Burney's works and her place in literature. His
summary of Evelina and of Cecilia is excellent, whilst he
skims much of the cream from the diary of the lady who
became Madame D'ARBLAY, and had her fame trumpeted by
MacAULAY. On the whole a delightful work, unsurpassed in
the series, possibly to some extent because in this case the
Man of Letters chances to be a woman.
Parody is an evidence of popularity, and parody by an
eminent parodist is a tribute to the exceptional popularity
of the original. So that when that clever humourist in art,
Mr. CARRUTHERs Gould, the now well-known F. C. G., hits
upon the idea of adapting Sir John TENNIEL's immortal
illustrations of Alice in Wonderland to the purposes of
political caricature, the success of the venture is assured. And
so it comes about that John Bull's Adventures in the Fiscal
Wonderland (METHUEN), a clever political parody on LEwis

The best Act of this play is the one in “Creagh's Cottage,”

D.S.O., as well as author could wish, and by Mr. SYDNEY

subaltern, Lieut. Thompson.
Mr. WANE TEMPEST, as the indifferent motorist and amateur
| conjurer, is very funny in the little bits where he comes into
the show (the notion of this character is excellent), though
why he, as a gentleman, when tied and bound into a chair as
an amateur DAVENPORT Brother, and hidden behind a screen,
does not make his presence known, as any gentleman would
have done, in order to avoid hearing the private chat of three
ladies, is one of those things that the author would find it
hard to explain satisfactorily. We should have thought
that this weakness must have been detected, and therefore
remedied, at rehearsals.
As the Earl of Kinooth—“with a song”—Mr. BRANDON
THOMAs is thorough-going, and revives memories of the fine
old Irish gentleman in the time of CHARLEs LEVER's Knight

gramme informs us “was specially written by BASIL Hood
and composed by HAMISH McCUNN at the invitation of the
Military Authorities for inclusion in a Soldiers' Song Book
to be published by the War Office.” Fancy musical inspi-

ALL roads at Melbourne led to the
cricket ground this morning, and long
before the hour for the start the ring
was thronged with eager spectators.
Larrikins and stockmen, sundowners
with their blue-blanketed swags over
their shoulders, blacks with narrow
shields on their forearms and boomerangs
in their hands—all sat in the shade of
the eucalyptus trees waiting for the
great conflict to begin. Soon the two
great Captains strolled forth to examine
the wicket; Montagu NoBLE, his intel-
lectual countenance bearing an anxious
look, and the irrepressible, boyish
“PLUM,” with a broad smile on his
youthful face. A roar of “My word ”

enthusiastic blacks proclaimed that

too simple, thought the great batsman,
as he prepares for the deadly curl when
it rises from the pitch. But there
is no curl, and the straight, easy
ball taps the batsman on the pad.
“How's that?” roar the English team.
“Out,” says the umpire, and the puzzled
batsman retires. Two wickets for four
runs—there's life in the old country yet.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OBITUARIST'S GUIDE.
EveRY precaution is now being taken
by the Editor of Willow's Annual to
prevent a mistake similar to that by
which the author of The Shutters of
Silence has been declared to be dead on
the strength of the resemblance between
the title of that novel and of The House
with the Green Shutters by the late GEORGE
Douglas BROWN.
The editorial sanctum is in future to
be placarded with some such monitions
as those which follow, calculated to
check the enthusiasm of the too intrepid
necrologist.
It is well to remember that
different books whose titles chance
to contain the same word are not
necessarily from the same pen.
Thus The Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire was not written by
Mr. MARION CRAwFoRD, although the
circumstance that he is the author
of A Roman Singer might of course
| naturally lead to that belief.
Kindly do your best to bear in
mind that Sir LEwis MoRRIS is not
the author of DANTE's Inferno. The
Epic of Hades was composed on
the Metropolitan and District Rail-
ways, not among the Tuscan vines.
Abstain if you can from commit-
ting the error of supposing that
“The Poet's Diary,” now appearing
in the National Review, is from the
fountain pen of the late JANE AUSTEN.
Be careful not to be beguiled by
partial resemblances, however strik-
ing. Although it is true that Sir
George Tressady and Sir Richard
Calmady are both baronets, and
although the last two syllables of
the surnames of each are identical,
there is no relationship whatever
between Colonel ENDERBY's wife and
Lady Rose's daughter.
It is much more comfortable for
all concerned not to confound the
authors of The Christian and The
Master Christian.

proofs of a work entitled The Literature

Drought was left on the deck of a sub-

As to The Literature of Swimming, one
of our representatives having called at

proofs were perhaps wisely confiscated
by the omnibus driver, with an eye to
what will probably be required of him

ARMS AND THE WOMAN.
Being a privileged account of an Election at
THE LADIEs’ CAVALRY CLUB.
It was a solemn séance composed of martial dames,
Discussing likely candidates with military claims;
| The doors were doubly bolted; but, through a little bird,
I am enabled to report excatly what occurred.
| The Amazon presiding over the lists of Mars
| Was Lady Susan CROPPER, of the Eighty-eighth Hussars,
And she had just put forward the name of BELLA SQUEERs,
| Third cousin to a Captain in the “Bounding Buccaneers.”
| Then spoke a Horse Guard's lady, a welter-weight was she,
And rode her husband's chargers to hounds at sixteen-three:
“I ask for information; pray, who is ‘BELLA SQUEERs'?
And who, by all that's holy, are the ‘Bounding Buccaneers'?
“Cavalry of the Line I know; one meets them here and
there; ”
(“The Liner she's a lady!” observed the angry Chair);
“But if you mean to keep select, you simply can't allow
The claims of fancy regiments raised Heaven alone knows
how !”
At this a stout Yeowoman repressed a rising sob,
And called the previous speaker a horrid, horrid snob;
And said that if the Junior Arm should fail to get its dues,
| Herself would bar all candidates related to the Blues.
| Dare I describe the issue, what language rent the air,
'What sudden transformations took place in people's hair,
| Or how a West Kent's aunt-in-law had both her pince-nez
- broke,
And something awful happened to a Kitchen Lancer's toque?
A Colonel's wife (“The Dye-hards”) betrayed a natural pique
On being drenched with coffee all down her dexter cheek,
And, though of temperate habits and never known to faint,
Swore frankly like a trooper, and swooned from loss of paint.
I shrink to estimate the cost in limb and even life
Had not a nervous member screamed, “I disapprove of strife;
| Stop! or I fetch my Father, a noted man of gore,
Experienced in handling a “Gyppy' Camel Corps!”
*:: : + º º: º
Great peace ensued. They kissed again, like dear mock-
turtle doves,
Honºlº and Line and Yeomanry, and called each other
“loves”;
And by unanimous consent elected BELLA SQUEERs,
| Third cousin to a Captain in the “Bounding Buccaneers.”
O. S.
A DISCLAIMER.—We are authorised to state, clearly and
emphatically, that Mr. HERBERT BEERBOHM TREE, speaking as
The Darling of the Gods and of other parts of the house,
absolutely declines to accept the very slightest responsibility
for the present unhappy rupture of amicable relations
| between Russia and Japan. He has looked at matters by
the light of the Red Lamp, and tried to bring about a personal
meeting between the astute Russian diplomatist who was the
W. personage in that play and Zakkuri, the Mikado's
inister of State, now on a visit to His Majesty's. Mr. TREE
regrets being compelled to declare such contemplated meet-
ing to be absolutely impracticable.
IN real life, the London letter-writer on the Westminster
informs us, the real name of “Mr. MAARTEN MAARTENs" is
“Joost M. W. Poortex-SchwARTz.” Joost so.
PICKY BACK.
(Being the Seventh Passage from the reinconanation of Picklock Holes.)
THE ADVENTURE OF THE Swiss BANKER.
ONE incident—I might almost call it an adventure—which
diversified and added zest to the relations between Picklock
HoLEs and myself is of a character so astounding as to
completely and without the possibility of denial cast into
the shade all those adventures which my duty to posterity
no less than my vehement admiration for our one and only
unparalleled detective marvel has hitherto compelled me to
narrate. I will now endeavour to set it down, though I am
fully aware how inadequate my humble powers .#.
composition are to the task of doing justice to one so primus
inter pares as was (alas! that I should have to use a tense
which, as applied to him, is his only imperfection) as was
Picklock Holes.
Much against our will we had temporarily left our comfort-
able bourgeois quarters in Baker Street. It was no easy
matter for us, as may well be imagined, to tear ourselves
away with so many investigations unfinished. When I say
that the shocking murders in the Rue Morgue, and the all
but inexplicable mystery of MARIE Roget—affairs which had
been so disgracefully bungled by M. DUPIN and Mr. PoE of
the united Paris and New York police—had been but recently
confided to Mr. Holes, it will be understood that our natural
reluctance to depart had become well nigh insuperable.
Still, duty is duty, and when the Duke Cosimo Di MonTE
CARLo called upon us one day and offered Holes a year of his
ducal income if he would discover the whereabouts of his
erring son, the Marchese CASINo DEI Rouletti, we could no
longer hesitate.
ving, therefore, given the landlady strict instructions
to keep the Baker Street Rifle Club in full activity and to
put any inquirers from the Free Trade Union off the scent,
we departed one morning from Charing Cross with two
black bags and a guide to polite conversation in four
languages, and on the following morning, Holes as usual
taking the lead and driving all the railway engines, we
found ourselves deposited in a bright little town on one of
the many shores of the Mediterranean. Why we had come
to that precise place I know not, nor did I gather its name.
It was enough for me that Holes was my leader. I ought to
add that, the better to conceal ourselves and our mission
from prying eyes, Holes had assumed the disguise of a Swiss
banker, while I was garbed as his sister, a not unprepossess-
ing lady of forty-five summers, wearing a large hat with
plumes and carrying a small yellow reticule suspended by a
gold chain from my left wrist. Thus attired nobody could
possibly have suspected that it was us, nor, if we could have
seen ourselves, could we have imagined that we were other
than what we appeared to be.
The scene as we entered what I afterwards learnt was the
Ducal Palace was indeed a brilliant one, with its gathering of
rank and fashion and beauty and wealth from all the quarters
of the globe. Holes, however, paid no attention to it, but,
brushing his way haughtily and inductively
ast the in-
numerable obsequious and liveried attendants, he made his
way swiftly to a gorgeously decorated inner hall, where
crowds of Europe's bluest-blooded aristocracy were mingled
with all that America could show of millionaires round
numerous large tables on which was proceeding a game that
was as obviously moneyed as it was manifestly mysterious.
“Potson,” said Holes in a tremor of excitement, as we
paused before one of these tables, “Potson, do you see that
man?” He pointed to an individual decently dressed in
black, who was spinning a small ivory ball in a wheel set
in the centre of the table. “That, unless I am mistaken—
but tush | listen to him.”

PHILOSOPHER AND PHILANTHROPIST.
“Years ago,” confesses Mr. FREDERIC HARRISON in The Fort-
nightly for February, “I wrote a piece urging Millionaires to
consider if their public benefactions might not be as usefully
bestowed on the drama as on libraries and laboratories.”
If, as seems a plausible conjecture, the “piece” Mr.
HARRISON wrote was a dramatic composition, it is a thousand
pities that no Manager has, as yet, had the enterprise to
produce it.
Is it possible that the following scene (which has been
communicated to Mr. Punch “from a usually well-informed
source”) may be a fragment from this colossal work?, Mr. P.
himself prefers to express no opinion, merely remarking that
the hero's name, “DERFERIC RASHIRON,” reads suspiciously
like an anagram, while, from internal evidence,—but the
scene had better be left to speak for itself.
ACT WII., Sc. 21.--The Study of Mr. CADMUs K. WoLLUM-
DUMPER, the American Multi-Millionaire. Mr. W. discovered
at work with a cigar in his mouth.
Butler (announcing). Mr. DERFERIC RASHIRON |
[Mr. RASHIRON enters. Butler retires.
Mr. Rashiron. Mr. WoLLUMDUMPER, I come in the hope of
enlisting your sympathies on behalf of
Mr. Vollumdumper (genially). That's all right, Mr. RASH-
IRON. Sit right down. Any little thing I can do for you in
the nature of a library or a laboratory
Mr. Rash. (sadly). Thanks—but neither would be of any
appreciable benefit in this case. I am here, Mr. VoILUM-
DUMPER, to plead the cause of a once great educational
instrument, now fallen from her high estate upon evil days.
Mr. Woll. (with ready sympathy). Some decayed School-
marm? Well, I've never forgotten all I owe to my old
School-marm. Say now, Mr. RASHIRON, how would it be if I
purchased one of your leading Public Schools as a going con-
cern, and fixed up your on-fortunate client as head-mistress?
Mr. Rash. You mistake me. The client I represent is the
British Drama.
Mr. Woll. You don't mean to say the British Drama is as
reduced as all that 1
Mr. Rash. (impressively). It is suffering from a complaint
which afflicts us all--an impatience of continuous attention,
of serious thought, of any hitch in our ease, our luxuries, or
our indulgences—in brief, a sort of tarantula of restlessness,
which makes us skip from one pleasant spot to the next
without greatly enjoying any one in peace!
Mr. Woll. (concerned). Mr. RASHIRON, if you're feeling so
bad as all that, you want to go right home and take a Nerve
Tonic. That's what you want to do. You've been using
up the grey matter of your brain, Sir!
Mr. Rash. (slightly annoyed). When I said we were afflicted
in that way, I did not mean Myself—I meant almost every-
body else. -
Mr. Voll. This is an age of Hustle, Sir, and that's a fact.
But where does the British Drama come in 2
Mr. Rash. It doesn't come in—it is going out. I assure
you that the People who will sit steadily through three hours
of intellectual drama is really very limited.
Mr. Voll. I guess that don't astonish me. Three hours
on end of intellectual drama would be apt, in my case, to
result in considerable cramps.
Mr. Rash. It may cramp the body, but it enlarges the
mind. However, the modern Playgoer cares for nothing but
“Stars,” gorgeous robes, and nauseous sensations.
Mr. Voll. (interested). Is that so? And among your popular
“Stars,” Sir CHARLEs WYNDHAM, Mr. John HARE, Mr. TheE,
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, Mr. BourchIER, and so on, which
should you consider was dressing himself up most gorgeous,
and providing the most nauseous sensations just now?
Mr. Rash. Why—er—to tell you the truth, I haven't had
the patience to go and see any of their productions lately.
I know that, as Drama, they would be beneath my contempt.
I was referring more particularly to the deplorable craze for
Musical Comedy.
Mr. Voll. Then it's Musical Comedy which supplies the
demand for nauseating sensations?
Mr. Rash. So I understand from my friend Mr. John HARE.
I : hardly say I do not patronise such entertainments
myself.
Mr. Woll. Well, lº, seem pretty well posted anyway. But
what I don't catch on to at present, Mr. RASHIRON, is just
where you imagine I'm going to be of any use to you.
Mr.Rash. (eagerly). If you only would, Mr.WolluMDUMPER, you
might be the Herodes Atticus of a revived Athenian Drama
Mr. Voll. I'm ever so sorry to disappoint you, Mr.
RASHIRON, but I never had any gift for play-acting. I
guess if I was to make my début on the boards in an
Athenian drama, I shouldn't get bouquets flung at me—not
to any great extent.
Besides, I've no opinion of these old
Athenian writers. I once dipped into Homer in a translation
—but I couldn't get along with him. No, Sir!
Mr. Rash. (pained). I am not asking you to act in a
theatre, my dear Mr. WoLLUMDUMPER. I merely ask you to
endow one. -
Mr. Voll. Is that your idea? But what am I going to
endow a theatre for?
Mr. Rash. Why, to enable it to produce a constant suc-
cession of all the great British masterpieces that have been
undeservedly forgotten, and make it independent of the
cash taken at the doors.
Mr. Voll. I reckon that item would be a negligible quantity
anyway.
Mr. Rash. Possibly. Then we should put an end to the
detestable ‘Long runs’ which are almost forced upon
Managers nowadays by our five or six million playgoers.
We should give no play for more than two or three nights
together.
Mr. Voll. Not even if all those five or six million playgoers
were yearning to come and see it? That does sound harsh '
I presume you have a sufficient stock of forgotten British
masterpieces to enable you to worry along for a year or so at
three nights apiece?
Mr. Rash. We need not depend entirely on the Past.
If one of our leading playwrights were to offer us a drama
that struck us as possessing sufficient merit, we should not
be unwilling to produce it.
Mr. Voll. And may I take it your leading playwrights are
all in revolt against this detestable “long run" system?
Mr. Rash. I have received assurances of sympathy from
no less than five of our principal dramatists, who would,
I am sure, all consider it an honour to have their works
performed on such a stage as ours, quite apart from any
sordid pecuniary considerations.
Mr. Voll. They'd ruther have a three nights' run with
you than a year at the ordinary playhouses? Well now,
that's vurry creditable to them! And who are going to
perform in these dramas?
Mr. Rash. A cultivated and highly trained company,
engaged at small permanent salaries, with a perpetual
interchange of parts.
Mr. Voll. And will they be equal in talent to the ordinary
popular theatrical “Stars”?
Mr. Rash. Equal? The additional experience they will
acquire will soon render them infinitely superior.
Mr. Voll. And yet they'll stay on with hard work and
small salaries, and never want to set up as Stars on their own
account.” I’d no idea such beautiful natures existed, Mr.
RASHIRoN
appreciate their self-denial.
Seems a pity, though, there'll be no Public to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Mr. Rash. No Public? Out of five or six million play-
goers! My dear Sir!
Mr. Woll. I understood you to remark that these five or six
million playgoers were skipping about so under the influence
of bites from restless tarantulas they cann’t give their attention
to anything but nauseous sensations?
Mr. Rash. That unhappily is so. But an Endowed Theatre
will educate them to appreciate the Intellectual Drama.
Mr. Woll. But they've got to come to it first to be educated.
And they ain't likely to come till they are. That's where
the sawdust seems to me to sort of trickle out of your scheme,
Sir.
Mr. Rash. Putting that aside, is there no glory in being
the very first philanthropist to endow a theatre? Is it nothing
to feel secure of the applause of Posterity?
Mr. Voll. I guess you cann’t fill a playhouse with the
applause of Posterity. It appears to me that a vurry essential
requisite to an endowed theatre, with a permanent company
on permanent salaries, is a permanent audience. And
don't just seem to see that permanent audience.
Mr. Rash. I have a list here of distinguished people who
have signed an appeal for a Subsidised Stage, most of whom,
I should say, would probably attend its performances.
(Proudly). The signatories number over seventy already.
Mr. Voll. Quite a nice little crowd, Mr. RASHIRON! But
say, don't you think they’d feel a bit lonesome inside a
palatial subsidised playhouse? What's the matter with
inducing your friends to club together for themselves and
endow some suitable back-drawing-room? . . . . .
[The remainder of this scene is unfortunately º
WANISHING CHANCES.
[Speaking of the new Defence Act, under which the State is in
certain cases to bear the cost of defending prisoners, Mr. Justice
BIGHAM, at the Manchester Winter Assizes, was tempted to regret the
various steps by which our legislation had gradually taken away from
the unfortunate prisoner every chance of escape.]
THERE was once a time when Justice was more merciful by far,
And, if blinder, she was kinder to the prisoner at the bar,
For she bade him stand in silence while the tear-drops in his
eyes
Mutely glistened as he listened to the prosecutor's lies.
There is nothing like dumb sorrow in the rhetorician's art
For appealing to the feeling of a jury's tender heart:
So the culprit wept his hardest, looked a martyr, and in short
He was pitied and acquitted by a sympathetic Court.
Then said Justice, “Give him counsel if he's got the means
to pay,”
And she surely meant it purely in the very kindest way;
So the culprit was defended and his case could set no more
Legal science at defiance as it used to do before.
But his counsel still could argue, “Lo! my client's lips are
- shut.
Could you hear him, you'd revere him as an injured martyr,
but—” -
And the aposiopesis might be calculated to
Rob the jury of their fury and to bring the culprit through.
Next said Justice, after pondering the problem in her breast—
Need I mention her intention was entirely for the best?—
"Let the prisoner summon witnesses to strengthen his defence,
If he fancies there are chances thus to prove his innocence.”
| So the witnesses were summoned to the sessions, as you know;
They were flustered, and they blustered, and they made a
sorry show;
Even jurymen saw through them, their offences were so rank,
So their fictions brought convictions and the prisoner's
chances sank.
THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
“ONE HUNDRED PENNY CIGARs. That will BE EIGHT-AND-Fourpence,
PLEASE, MADAM.”
“Thank you.
Box; BECAUSE THAT's The only sort My HusbAND REALLY CAREs For 1"
Now will. YoU JUST PUT THEM IN A Flor DE CUBA
Yet again said gentle Justice, “I will let him speak himself,
Nor º him, hapless victim, to a tongue that pleads for
pell.
So she took away the muzzle which was seldom known to fail,
And his stammer went to hammer in his coffin one more nail;
But he still could tell the jury, “I am poor and cannot pay
Huge expenses for defences as a richer person may”—
'Twas the only trump-card left him, but it even yet might win
On occasion his evasion from the consequence of sin.
Then a last time kindly Justice: “Never, never let it be
Said or written that in Britain I'm a thing of £ s. d.
Let the State provide him counsel, let her stick at no expense
To befriend him and defend him with the rarest eloquence.”
Cruel kindness! for no longer as a victim can he pose
Of a system which dismissed him undefended to his woes—
When he's every opportunity, the chance that's left him still
Of acquittal, lately little, now is practically nil.
- Stage Actuality.
SCENE–His Majesty's Theatre during an Interval.
First Stalled Lady. Isn't it wonderfully realistic? I can't
think how any critic can say it's not like the actual thing.

quite caught the Japanese accent.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
If Mr. JAMES MACLAREN CoBBAN had bestowed a trifle more
care on construction when developing the well-imagined plot
of The Iron Hand (John LoNG), he would have given us a
story, not less absorbing, but far easier, to follow through
its various scenes. Pity that to this author it should be so
difficult to keep out of his romance a kind of inferior
Sherlock Holmes, instead of taking the trouble to invent
a brand-new type exactly suited to his purpose. ... The
characters are well devised, the dialogue is generally to
the point; and the action throughout stimulates the reader's
curiosity. -
In The American Prisoner (METHUEN) Mr. EDEN PHILLPOTTs
makes a new departure from the novels that have justly
established his fame. It and they have in common the
plains and hills of Dartmoor and the vigorous life of Dart.
In his latest work Mr. PHILLPOTTS has essayed a more
elaborate plot, which takes longer in working out, and
demands fuller muster of dramatis personae. My Baronite
cannot say it lures him from his early love, The River. But
it is a masterful book, grounded upon historical interest, full
of dramatic episodes, enriched by the talk of rustics recalling
THOMAS HARDY at his best. One of the strongest characters
is Lovey Lee, the gipsy miser with a capacity for miscellaneous
crime perhaps not rare in woman. Peter Norcot is another
type of villain drawn with strong sure hand. Apart from
rustic humour the sombreness of the story is relieved by the
nobility and self-sacrifice displayed by the half-gipsy youth,
John Lee. In sternly realistic manner the narrative recalls
scenes in Merrie England during the time of the titanic
struggle with NAPOLEON.
To their series of Highways and Byways Messrs. MACMILLAN
have added a volume on Sussex. Mr. E. W. LUCAS supplies
the letterpress, which is charmingly and liberally illustrated
by Mr. FREDERICK GRIgGs. The work is less, a guide-book
than prattle, light but learned, about the districts dealt with.
As Mr. LUCAs puts it in happy phrase, his aim has been
rather to gather a Sussex bouquet than to present facts to
the prosaic traveller. The result is a charming volume.
My Baronite fancies the next best thing to going on a little
tour through Sussex is to sit down and read Mr. LUCAS's chat
about its highways and byways, the eye dwelling with
pleasure on the sketches of Mr. GRIGGs.
Thoroughly appreciating the lightness of touch and the
delicacy f humour that are the characteristics of Mr. ARCHER's
journalistic work, the Baron hailed with pleasure the appear-
ance of a volume from his pen entitled Real Conversations
(HEINEMANN), to which he expected to find some sub-title
qualifying the descriptive adjective. But he was dis-
appointed: it turns out to be a plain though not very simple
record of his dialogues with various persons, most of whose
names are as household words to all who, in England at least,
are in any way conversant with literature and drama.
Mr. WILLIAM ARCHER pays twelve visits and (alas, the word!)
“interviews” twelve different persons, each one in his
own home. We know now what Mr. ARCHER says when
he calls upon Mr. PINERO, how he commences a conversation
with Mrs. CRAIGIE or with Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPs, and how
pleased Mr. W. S. GILBERT appears to have been to receive
the genial interviewer at his country house: and so with
all his other smiling victims. Well, this sort of thing
is a matter of taste; as JEREMY BENTHAM puts it, “it may
not be my taste nor your taste, but I have no right
to condemn it as bad taste.” The last (but one or
two) of the Barons, is content to let it rest at this; and
personally he will rejoice to hear the last of “The Last of
the Interviewers.”
L. T. MEADE's storv of Nurse
Charlotte (John 1.is patheti-
cally interesting, and told with
charming simplicity. The Baron
takes it for granted that the
author's graphic sketches of
Hospital work (which, as being
quite free from anything ap-
proaching false sentimentality,
are neither particularly attrac-
tive nor peculiarly repellent) are
true to life. If so, the moral of
this portion of the story will
serve an excellent purpose.
NOTE ON A RECENT APPOINTMENT.
THERE was a French piece produced some few years
ago entitled Les Deua Gosses, played at the Ambigu, a
theatre nominally most appropriate for its production, there
being evidently a certain ambiguity about the title. Of
course, there never were Deuz Gosses—il n'y en a qu'un, and
that is EDMUND GossE, author of, amongst some twenty
volumes of prose and verse, “Gosse sips in a Library,” so
suggestive of not drinking too deep of the Pierian spring;
and now, having been appointed Librarian to the House of
Lords, he will be able to indulge to the full his thirst for
knowledge. For his rare wit and humour Mr. Gosse was
created a Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olaf,
the patron, as the sound of the name implies, of merriment.
Mr. GossE speaks French like a Frenchman, English like an
Englishman, German as well as a German, and in various
other languages he can lecture, converse, write poetry and
rose. And with all these accomplishments his taste is purely
ossemopolitan.
LITTLE FARCES FOR THE FORCES.
THE New ARMY CouncIL.
SCENE I.—The ante-room to the Council Chamber at the Horse
Guards. The Four Military Members are chatting together
rather nervously.
First Member. Everything is to be after the strict Admiralty
pattern, I understand. I do hope we shall not be asked to
go to sea in the Enchantress.
Second Member. I trust not; I suffer very severely from
mal de mer. I have had an anchor tattooed on my forearm
to give local colour, and am using a strap with my overalls
instead of braces in order to hitch them up occasionally. I
trust that will give the necessary seafaring touch to my
appearance. -
Third Member (producing a telescope). I have brought this
with me to carry under my arm. I have never seen any
distinguished i. painted without one.
Fourth Member. I proposed to rub my hands this morning
with a pennyworth of tar and to chew a quid, but my wife
dissuaded me. -
First Member. We shall smoke long churchwardens and
drink hot rum-and-water, I presume.

SYMPATHISING WITH JAPAN.
EveRYONE is, or ought to be, praising
“the plucky little Japs.” No one, not
even the K. York Herald writers,
could admire the methods of govern-
ment and diplomacy which prevail in
Russia. But the idiots in a provincial
theatre, who hissed some quite inoffen-
sive performers because they were
Russians, were sublime in their stupidity.
If our neutrality, combined with reason-
able personal sympathy for Japan, is to
be displayed in this manner, we may
soon expect to read such items of news
as the following:—
A fearful scene was witnessed yester-
day evening at the Amphitryon Res-
taurant. ne of the diners ordered
some caviare. The waiter explained
that caviare was no longer served. The
gentleman complained to the head
waiter, who offered him Japanese rice
instead. By this time the dispute had
attracted the attention of the other
diners, who rose in a body. When
peace was restored, the unfortunate
gentleman was rescued from a position
of great discomfort under a broken
table, and proved not to be a Russian
at all, but a Mr. John Robinson of
London.
Yesterday a lady walking in the Park
was followed by a hooting crowd. The
police, after repeatedly charging the
mob, saved her from attack. It was
then discovered that she was supposed
to be wearing a mantle of Russian
sable. However, when she explained
that it was only imitation, and almost
certainly made in London, the crowd
cheered her loudly and dispersed.
A bootmaker's shop in Oxford Street
was entirely wrecked the night before
last. Just as the magistrates were
about to send for the military and read
the Riot Act, the cause of the tumult
was explained. It appeared that a pair
of brown boots in the window was
labelled “Best Russia.” A passer-by,
assuming these words to imply the
superiority of the Muscovite Empire,
for he was too excited to notice the
boots, raised a cry of indignation, and
the building was almost completely
wrecked before the mistake was made
clear.
A gentleman of studious appearance,
and wearing spectacles, was yesterda
observed to be reading the E.
translation of a novel by TolsToI in a
District Railway train. The other occu-
pants of the compartment nearly tore
his clothes off his back, and threw him
out on the platform at South Kensing-
ton station. It was then found that
he was a schoolmaster at Ealing, and
not a Russian professor, as was sup-
posed.
The establishment of a provision
merchant and grocer at Brixton was
burnt down yesterday evening, after an
extraordinary outbreak of popular vio-
lence. It appears that he sold eggs at
various prices, and that a customer, who
had bought some of the cheapest quality,
stated publicly, or in a public-house,
that they were imported from Russia.
About seven hours later, in the early
hours of the morning, when the building
was entirely gutted, and the mob was
kept back § the infantry drawn up at
the end of all the neighbouring streets,
the grocer was able to prove, to the
satisfaction of the police authorities,
that the eggs were new-laid and came
from Canada.
Without waiting for the Borough
Council to take action, the residents in
St. Petersburgh Place, Bayswater, fearing
popular violence, have removed all the
inscriptions of the name in that street,
and have substituted the words “Tokio
Terrace.”
A New Vogue.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday night,
February 8.-Have often observed that
depth of dulness is plumbed in Commons
when it enters upon debate with long pre-
paration. Here we are at last unmuzzled,
as Mr. G. said when in an earlier century
he, thrown out at Oxford University,
went down to Lancashire. Last Session
none of us dared open our mouth on the
Fiscal Question under pain of PRINCE
ARTHUR's shocked displeasure. Members
grew accustomed to beholding sudden
transformation. One moment i. would
be sitting smiling, debonair, on Treasury
Bench. Someone, greatly daring, asked
him what Ministers were going to do
about DoN José's scheme of Fiscal
Reform. Instantly transmogrification
took place. Secret was disclosed that
behind a smiling countenance PRINCE
ARTHUR hid an angry face. His anger
was terrible to look upon.
By and by it became the practice of
Members about to put the question to
assume a position equivalent to being in
laager. On the Opposition side the
brothers WASON found themselves in
singular request. At question time
their company was sought with a per-
tinacity that became embarrassing. No
one is quite certain which is the loftier
height. Clackmannan claims pre-
eminence for EUGENE; Orkney and Shet-
land swear (in Gaelic) for CATHCART.
However that be, there is historical record
that united height of Bounding Brothers
is 12 ft. 6ins. and their aggregate weight
36 stone 5 lbs. avoirdupois. To whatever
lengths PRINCE ARTHUR's anger might
carry him, howsoever his eyes might
flash, his brow frown, a man firing off a
question about Fiscal Policy entrenched
behind either WASON was physically safe.
These little manoeuvres no longer
necessary. Yester year, driven into a
corner by DON José's activity, having, as
he frankly admitted, no settled con-
victions on question of Fiscal Reform,
PRINCE ARTHUR hit upon happy device of
lºng, departmental committee of
inquiry. It was a sort of Wehmgericht,
meeting in secret. Few knew where,
not many could repeat the names of the
Members composing it. What the House
of Commons knew only too well was that
as long as this dread inquest was going
forward no Member must speak of Fiscal
Reform in hearing of Prime Minister.
Little game now played out. Embargo
removed; the most inconsiderable
Member may say “Fiscal Reform"
without danger of losing his head.
Nay, amendments may be moved and
Ministers are , boldly challenged to
declare on which side of the fence they
mean to descend. It is true that, owing
to accidents all deplore, there is no one

As County GUY discovered
when he differed from his Unionist
. on the question of Free Trade,
adhesion to DoN José's views at a par-
ticular epoch is indispensable to main-
tenance of friendly relations.
With that reservation the tribute paid
in the House on Tuesday night was
well deserved. Relentless as an enemy,
DON José is priceless as a friend. He
will do anything, and, what is some-
times even more valuable, will insist
upon others doing something, for faith-
ful adherents. There is a touch of
pathos in his relations, running back
for more than thirty years, with the
late Powell, WILLIAMs and the happily
still living JESSE Collings.
“My dear Toby,” he once said to me,
“you may gird at me as you like; say
what you please. I don't care. But I
do beg you as a personal favour not to
hold up to ridicule JESSE Collings or
Powell Williams.”
Rarely has friendship laid on a
coffin so costly a garland as was placed
on that of Powell WILLIAMs by the
hand of a statesman who on the Conti-
nent is regarded as a sort of man-eating
ogre, who by a large section of the pub-
lic at home is looked upon as a relent-
less, adamantinely-hard, self-seeking
politician, eager only to serve his own
ends, relentless in trampling down any
who stray in the way. On the eve of a
great Parliamentary battle, where he
alone had skill and strength to with-
stand a combined attack personally
directed against him, eager as ever for
the delight of battle, conscious of the
value of this last opportunity of defining
and defending his position, he withdrew

consulting Russia as to whether the
date was a convenient one.

that Monaco and Sahara will, of course,

It seems to be the eternal misfortune

THE FULLY-FURNISHED Foot.
I HAVE often been asked how many pairs of boots and
shoes a gentleman should possess. After giving much
thought to the subject I reply, forty. These are divided
thus: ordinary pairs for walking, four black and two tan;
shooting boots, two; spring-side Wellingtons for cub-hunt-
ing; silver-plated sand shoes for Trouville; a pair of Alpine
waders for climbing the Wetterhorn; hob-nailed elephant-
hide boots with shark-skin laces for receiving duns; other
boots of various kinds; court shoes with paste buckles; and
dancing pumps. The above are obligatory, but personally
I keep a pair of full morocco Bluchers for calling at the
Times Office. My friend Major Howe, who fought in
Bhootan under Field-Marshal Dowie, once remarked to me
on the supreme importance of having enough boots, and I
have never forgotten his advice.
FOOTW FAR FANCIES.
UNDERSTUDIEs For TREEs.
The question then comes, Should one have separate trees
for each pair? Being always, to the best of my ability, the
friend of the economical, I say, No. There are various
methods by which one may contrive inexpensive substitutes
for trees. To fill the boot with moist plaster of Paris is a
sure preservative of its shape, but to extract the cast is
sometimes a little tedious. A better plan is to place a pair
of shooting stockings in the boots and, after hermetically
sealing them, to apply a bicycle pump and inflate them to
their fullest extent, renewing the operation whenever the air
seems to have escaped. The inventive mind will doubtless
think of other expedients.
SANDALS NOT RECOMMENDED.
The fashion of wearing sandals has come in a good deal of
late, but after giving them a good trial I have come to the
conclusion that they are not suited to our climate in the
winter months. As I was crossing the Strand one wet day
in December one of my sandals came off, and, before I could

Another point on which I am
often consulted is whether one should wear yellow boots
with a tall hat. My man, who is rather a purist in these
matters, discountenances the habit, but, on the other hand,
I have seen the Hon. REGGIE Doublewelt wearing the combi-
nation in question in Piccadilly. No hard and fast rule can
be drawn: it all depends on the social status and position
of the individual. I know a Guardsman who wears anato-

To Avoid WET FEET.
An excellent preventive of the too rapid deterioration
of the sole is to paint it morning and evening with a thick
coat of creosote. It is also on wet days a good thing to
fill the interstices between the soles and the uppers with

THE USE AND ABUSE
of LARGE FEET.
One of the severest
taxes on the purses of
men with refined tastes
but limited incomes is
that entailed by the
necessary outlay on
boots. You know the
French proverb,
“With good boots no
man ever was ill-
dressed: with bad
boots no man was ever
well - dressed,” and
there is undoubtedly
a great deal of truth
in the maxim. Some
men, however, are
cruelly handicapped
in the race of life.
There was my friend,
Sir ALGERNoN TREAD-
WELL, for example, one
of the finest fellows
who ever stepped, but
his feet were so large
that he had to put his
trousers on over his
head. They were, in
fact, if I might venture
on a pleasantry, regu-
lar cubic feet, and he
was never at his ease
in company or indeed
anywhere until he
| emigrated to Colorado
and received a large
salary and a public
testimonial for his
efforts in crushing the
beetle. Sir ALGERNoN's boot bill was some-
thing tremendous. No good maker would
i him a pair under three guineas,
and when he was hard up—which was
not uncommonly the case—he was some-
times driven to stay in bed for days at
a time rather than venture forth in
boots unsuited to his social status.
CHEAP Boots. A HAPPY Discovery.
Hitherto I have set my face like a

On Monday morning

the afternoon I wore
them at a medallion-

that they are not

ROYALTIES I RECOLLECT.
By H-L-E W-C-R-S-0.
XLVII.--THE KING AND QUEEN of PANTOMIMIA.
NEVER shall I forget the nerve-thrilling emotion with
which, after duly presenting my credentials to one of the
officials, I found myself inside the royal and ancient palace
at Drörilehn-Boestriet, awaiting the entrance of that august
couple, King Sollu MM and Queen SPRITELY of Pantomimia.
A gaudy multitude has gathered in the splendid hall
at the foot of the grand staircase; there is a pause; the
hangings of the arch above part, a glittering cortège of pages
and dames d'honneur descend, two by two. Then a flourish
of silver trumpets, and, in a flash, the Queen has fallen down
the entire flight of steps, and picked herself up with the
serene monchalance that only long habit can impart.
Must I confess that my first sensations were scarcely those
which I usually experience in the presence of Royalty”
The Queen has hardly a trace of the majestic bearing,
hardly a hint of the easy dignity, that distinguish so many
Sovereigns of my acquaintance. Her appearance is quaint,
almost to homeliness. I had an instant intuition that
my verses were not only unknown to her, but that
probably she would be even unaware that they had had
the honour of being crowned by the French Academy. ..It
crossed my mind, indeed, that her Royal Consort must, like
King CopherUA of old, have chosen a bride who was not
altogether his equal in rank.
But any suspicion of this kind was immediately put to
flight by the arrival of the King. He came in, looking
...i. though very grave; he wore no smile on his massive
countenance, though I fancied I could detect a twinkle of
humour in the small, wonderful eyes, whose colour and
depth reminded me of those solitaires in which twisted
strands of blue and green are embedded, as prawns in
translucent aspic.
The Queen's eyes, deep set and lustrous, with a fixed
appeal in their dark, inscrutable gaze, are decidedly her best
feature; the nose is too sharp and too highly coloured at the
tip, the flexible mouth too wide to be strictly beautiful, and
she evidently concerns herself very little about the style and
arrangement of her coiffure. Still, hers is a face that cannot
easily be forgotten by those who have ever been privileged
to look upon it. *
I was amazed by the extreme condescension and affability
of her manner with her Court. On the evening when I had
the honour of being admitted to her audience she entertained
us all by an inimitable account of her previous matrimonial
experiences, for it appears that she had been a widow at least
once before His Majesty invited her to share his throne.
Her former husband had not, it seemed, borne the most
exemplary of characters, and she even, hinted that certain
eccentricities on his part had been cruelly misunderstood by
the police, but with a delightful freedom from false shame
she kept her hearers in ripples of uncontrollable mirth by
revealing matters cn which most Sovereigns I have met
would prefer to observe a discreet reticence.
Both she and the King speak the English tongue with
I. ease and fluency, and a complete mastery of col-
oluialisms, though with a perceptible accent.
is Majesty is a keen student of English politics, and has
been known, so I was informed, to express fervent sympathy
with Mr. CHAMBERLAIN in his fiscal campaign; on this
occasion, however, he was more guarded in his references
to the subject.
He is a powerful if not a melodious vocalist, but affects
the ballads of the people rather than more ambitious com-
positions.
Like other monarchs I might mention, King Sollºwſ is
addicted to frequent and rapid changes of costume. When
I first saw him he was wearing a brown and gold Court suit,
set off by the crown and Royal robes; on the next occasion
his portly form was enveloped in a dressing-gown of startling
hue and design.
Subsequently he was in a bold-patterned tourist suit, with
a hat several sizes too small for him, appearing a little later
clothed in a military uniform which I was unable to identify.
Yet when again he met my view, to my unspeakable surprise
another change of dress, another change of face and humour,
was presented for our admiration; he was encased in a
waterproof suit and diver's helmet.
From all I could gather, His Majesty is no gourmet, and is
content with fare of the simplest description, his favourite
menu being bloaters and beefsteak pudding.
The Queen exercises the strictest supervision over the
household expenditure. I happened to be present at an
informal visit which she paid to the Royal kitchen, where
she held a consultation with her female chef, who is rather
on the footing of an intimate friend than an ordinary
domestic.
It was marvellous to see how searching was Her Majesty's
scrutiny of every item in the accounts; not a detail escaped
Her Majesty's comment--from the market price of tomatoes
and potatoes to the excessive consumption of soap and lard;
from the condition of a steak and kidney pie to the abnormal
appetite of the Royal cat —a remarkably fine animal, by the
way, of the rare breed which Pantomimia alone produces. . .
Later on, this same female chef and her son (a youth whose
natural intelligence is refreshingly free from any precocious
tendency) were honoured by the Royal command to pla
“Bridge” at their Majesties' own table –the Queen herself
condescending to instruct them in the rules of the game.
I was j, aghast at the want of tact and savoir !.
with which the Minister of the Interior accused her
Mistress of a revoke—a bétise that would, in at least one
Court where, though a youthful foreigner, I have been
treated like an honoured guest, have certainly been regarded
as lèse-majesté. -
Imagine my surprise on finding the offenders shortly after-
wards included in the party on board the King's submarine
house-boat' -
I cannot conclude without making some reference to
certain startling events which took place during my visit,
and which for a time seemed likely to render the King
and Queen permanent exiles from the throne and kingdom.
This was brought about by a mysterious usurper of
obscure origin, who was alleged—though I cannot vouch
for the authenticity of the statement - to have recentl
emerged from the interior of an egg. But the plot, ..
had something to do with the possession of a ring and
the identity of a long-lost Princess, was so involved that
I shall not attempt to unravel an intrigue which perhaps
will never be completely understood except by those behind
the scenes.
Fortunately, everything ended in the happiest possible
manner, and when the #. pair finally passed from our
view they were bowing right and left in a blaze of colour,
amidst the enthusiastic plaudits of the admiring multitude.
But even at that momºnt I could not restrain a half
childish disappointment. Of all the many Monarchs by
whom I have been entertained, these two were the only
Sovereigns who had neither requested a copy of my Rouma-
mian Ballads, nor entreated me as a boon to inscribe an
original poem in their autograph book! F. A.

conduct be considered rather harsh on the part of the
parents? Now the son of Herbert and Sylvia Fitzallen,

entitled My Lady of Rosedale really depends, is heard of

affectionately alluded to, or, so to put it, “honourably men-
tioned,” and yet never “gets a look-in ” The audience is
on the tiptoe of expectation, anxiously expecting the appear-
ance of this little person of considerable importance, aged
seven, whose name they are surprised to find does not appear

by the spectators to a mere oversight, or to some printer's
error easily remedied in the next issue. The old song,
“Jack's the boy to work, Jack's the boy to play,” seems
specially applicable to this little chap, as, unless he be asleep,
or at play, and he is always doing either one or the other, he
is invariably represented as unable to come to his motherSylvia
(Miss MABEL TERRY-LEwis), who is so devotedly attached to
him that, apparently, she permits him for the greater part
of the day to be out of her sight. May be, as a judicious
mother, she does not wish to bore her friends by bringing
him with her on a visit; but be that as it may, when the
presence of Master Jack is most particularly requested, and
when all the house, in the middle of the most interesting Third
Act, is on tenterhooks of expectation for the entrance of this
child of promise, the nursery governess, Helen (Miss LILAs
WALDEGRAVE), descends the steps of the terrace with the infor-
mation that the bright boy in most joyous mood has been taken
by his amiable father, as a great treat, for a drive with him
in a dogcart. His mother is in despair, for her reckless
ill-conditioned husband, from whom she is expecting to be
legally divorced, has thus asserted his authority, and she
may be compelled by maternal instinct to follow wherever
her crafty worse-half may have taken their child. She does
not even fel sure of ever seeing the boy again, and the
audience sympathise with her most sincerely, for they have
never seen the boy at all up to now, and now, if he does not
turn up in the course of the last Act, they will have to leave
without ever having caught a glimpse of this invisible child !
Cruel on the mother, hard on the audience, unkind of the
French author and English adapter, Monsieur ALFRED CAPUs
and Mr. CoMYNs CARR.
The Fourth Act is played, and not a sign of the boy! He
is not-lost; no–for value received, and ause his father
can do without his family ties, the boy is to be returned to
his mother, with care, right side up, after the play is over;
and his mother is to be free to go for her divorce and then
to marry Ralph Wigram (Sir CHARLEs WYNDHAM), the kind
gentleman who has saved her credit at her banker's by giving
thirty thousand pounds for a place worth about a third of
that sum, with the female fixture, however, Sylvia Fitzallen,
thrown into the bargain. Voilà tout. Sir CHARLEs WYNDHAM
makes the part fit him, and has a good scene or two with
the somewhat unemotional Sylvia.
Miss GERTRUDE KINGSTON may, in the course of the run,
perhaps make more of scheming Lady Prothero than she did
on the first night.
Both Miss MARY MooRE as Lady Mordaunt, and SYDNEY
RRough as her husband, do and say nothing in particular in

Mr. ALFRED Bishop is excellent in one of his elderly gentle-
men parts, Sir Arthur Prothero, a judge.
Mr. NYE CHART and Miss LETTICE FAIRFAx excite as much
placid interest in their characters as can be expected to be
º by third parties present in any ordinary pair of youthful
Overs.
The one part that stands out from all the dramatis personae
is that of the scoundrel Herbert Fitzallen, most admirably
played by Mr. Eille Norwood.
The dialogue is good, as anything written by Mr. CoMyNs
CARR is sure to be. But we cannot but consider Messrs.
CAPUs and CARR as two wicked uncles, who have burked the
one babe in the wood, the unfortunate Little Jack, the
Invisible Boy!
History Corrects Itself.
The floods in the low-lying environs of Windsor have
caused a question to be raised as to the authenticity of
WELLINGTON's remark upon the cause of his victory at
Waterloo. It now appears that the Iron Duke has been
wrongly credited with a phrase which was after all only an
adaptation from a mot of NELSON.'s, uttered just before his
fatal wound; and that it was not the Battle of Waterloo,
''.that of Trafalgar, which was “won on the playing-fields
of Eton.’
WAR NoTE. –The “Czar of all the Russias” must not be
confused with Mr. C. ARTHUR PEARSoN, who is known to
admiring Tariff reformers as merely the “Prince of all the
Hustlers.”
THE Daily Chronicle, under the heading “M.C.C. v. New
South Wales: Fine Batting Display by KNight,” said, “The

be noted that the tactics of ačrial

a great portion of his poem to the

letters, selected from the contents of a

any other:—
SIR,-The accident of which your
correspondent complains is H-
one that might happen to any-
body. All that he needs, in
my opinion, is a little perse-
verance and determination.
Perhaps travel would prove
it was in curing me under
similar circumstances. The
object of my devotion was a
lady whose refined singing
and dancing had created some-
thing of a furore at the music-
halls. My life was temporarily
blighted by the discovery that
she was º, married, and
that her youngest son was
then playing Hamlet in the
provinces. But I soon re-
covered on joining my ship
and going for my first voyage,
and since then her memory
has cost me scarcely a pang.
Like the good sailor I am, I
have now a wife at Marseilles,
a second at Amsterdam, a
third in London, and others
at Nagasaki, New York,
Athens, Archangel, and, I
believe, Constantinople.

SIR,-Your correspondent
might derive consolation from
the history of the Israelite
kings. King SoLoMON was in
all probability jilted—perhaps
frequently—in his salad days.

and not giving way, he

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE WEEK.
February 22.-This day four years
ago was remarkable for the fact that
there were three hours of sunshine and
only two heavy showers, in the course of
which a church in the Midlands was
destroyed by lightning.
On this day, 2900 years ago, the
editor of the first halfpenny paper in
Japan had his head cut off for circulating
a false report of the fall of Troy.
February 23–Thirty-second anni-
versary of Canon RAwNSLEY's first
sonnet. Since then he has written
upwards of 3000, many of which have
appeared in the local papers. When
this number is multiplied by 14, the
number of lines in a sonnet, it will be
seen that Canon RAwNSLEY is one of the
most voluminous poets of the century.
. February 24,--On this day, just 1908
years ago, the Roman Senate suppressed
the Speculum Diurnum for encouraging
the Roman matrons to play cards and
desert their spinning-wheels.
February 25.-Five years ago to-day
the mansion of the Earl of BLARNEY was
broken into and pillaged by burglars.
As a writer in the Blarney Sentinel
observed at the time, “After a fruitless
search all the jewels were recovered
except one pair of boots.”
Dr. Johnson was born on this day in
the early part of the eighteenth century.
In spite of his uncouth exterior and
ungracious manners, he endeared him-
self so much to his contemporaries that
DAym GARRICK, the eminent actor,
publicly saluted him as “Rare BEN
Johnson.” Amongst those who joined
him in his revelries at the “Mermaid
Inn” were EDMUND BURKE, Sir Joshua
REYNoLDs, OLIVER GoLDSMITH, Dean Swift,
John DRYDEN, and WARREN HASTINGs.
February 26.-On this day three years
ago there was heavy rain coupled with
a high wind, during which Mr. CHAPLIN's
umbrella was blown inside out as he was
walking from the House of Commons
to the Carlton Club.
Just seven years have elapsed since
on February 26, 1897, Mr. H. G. WELLs,
on the recommendation of his medical
adviser, abandoned Indian for China tea.
Prºcisely 6480 years ago to-day the
foundation stone of the Pyramid of
Cheops was laid in the presence of a
distinguished company.
February 27.-On this day, just half
a century back, the Poet Laureate shot
his first rabbit and commemorated the
event in the following epigram:
Alas, poor Bunny!
Nor love nor money
Can splice life's thread
Once you are dead.

IN connection with the Strand Maga-

he could produce a much more extended

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday morning,
February 16.-The first hour of a new
morning was half sped when a solitary
pedestrian might have been observed
crossing Palace Yard. In height, in
breadth, and withal a certain swinging
stride of the right limb, there was some-
thing familiar in the figure. As it passed
under the gaslight by the iron gates and
cast up a furrowed countenance to regard
the gloomy night, recognition was
complete.

What happened in connection with
the Chancellor of ExCHEQUER's speech?
Why, the Front Opposition benchmen,
resolved to make half-holiday, tent
across to AKERS-DOUGLAS note to that
effect. AustEN CHAMBERLAIN, dying to
deliver his carefully-prepared speech,
was obliged to step aside, leaving
debate on Ministerial side to a child

mere twin like FREDERick LAMBTON.
Pour comble de malheur, both these
loyal Ministerialists went dead against
the Government, whilst the House
remains ignorant of the view the
CHANCELLOR of Exchequer would have
taken of evidently growing intention on
part of former colleagues to throw over
“my right hon. friend, the Member for

This last the record of single day;
and there were seven of them, more than
an ordinary Parliamentary week. Small
wonder that the smile shrivelled on the
lips of the Home SECRETARY, that his
manly figure seemed positively shrunken
as he wearily walked home, wondering

speeches of multitudinous words ALWYNE
CoMPTON dropped a gem. It was one
of those jewels, four words long, which,
'stretched on the forefinger of Time, will
sparkle through the ages.
HENRY SAMUEL moved new amendment
to Address, denouncing employment
of Chinese labour in the Transvaal.
Made a speech that would have been
twice as effective had it been half as
long. For an hour and a quarter he
stood in the breach. Major SEELY,
seconding amendment, spoke for fifty
minutes. Here, out of a sitting pro-
viding maximum of eight hours' talk,
equally apportioned among six hundred
and seventy Members, two appropriated
a full quarter of the allowance!
MACNAMARA not the man to be beaten
in game of this kind. Hasn't had a
real breather this Session, and it already
three weeks old. What will they say in
Camberwell? Plunged in like duck
taking to the water, splashed round with
almost irritating evidence of enjoy-
ment.
“What,” he shouted at the rate of
one hundred and twenty words a minute,
“will the British soldier say when he
finds that the sequel to all his fighting in
South Africa is this indentured yellow
slavery?”
“He will say, ‘Nonsense,’” answered
Lord AlwynE, who, as despatches testify,
served in South Africa.

yet delivered in the fifth session of the
first Parliament of King Edward THE

to the spot, unweighted by superfluous
words. Later Swore cust—I mean,
CUST swore at large (of course in Par-

ing one or two well-directed blows. A
smart and effective speech. But CoMPTON
takes the cake.
Business done. — Debate opened on
Chinese labour in Transvaal.
Friday night—Everyone sorry to see
an empty seat on Front Opposition
Bench. SQUIRE of MALwood came to
town for the Session, but has only
fitfully attended. Not ill, not yet
aweary of the old game in which he has
played a brilliant part through thirty-
five memorable years. An affection of
the throat has temporarily deprived him
of use of his voice for platform purposes.
What it must have cost him to stand
aside whilst the Birmingham financial
heresy was under discussion for seven
nights who shall say? He looked in
once or twice whilst affair in progress.
But made no sign.
A hard hitter, the SQUIRE through a
long fighting career has never smitten
a man below the belt. For twoscore
years he has vigorously pounded honour-
able gentlemen opposite, whether known
as Tories, Conservatives, Dissentient
Liberals, Unionists, or Fair Traders.
To-day he has as many personal friends
in their ranks, is held in as high estima-
tion, as if he had fought by their side
through dubious wandering.
“I look upon HARcotRT,” PRINCE
ARTHUR once said to me, “as the last
living captain of the Old Guard of

ways like the rest of us. But he is a
possession the House of Commons would
be grieved to part with.”

talk, Address voted. Now for business.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
AMong a variety of classics of English literature published
in handy form at moderate price Messrs. NºwNEs are issuing
reprints of famous novels. My Baronite is just now reading
Godwin's Caleb Williams, a book whose name has been
familiar to him from boyhood though he never before came
across it in the calf. To be precise the little volume is
daintily bound in what the publishers call “limp lambskin.'
Delightful to hold, clear type makes it easy to read, and
thin paper gives lightness to its five hundred pages.
Amongst his various avocations Godwin himself was a
publisher. But he never turned anything out neater than
this, certainly not at the price. Other novels of later date,
forming part of the same series, are Harry Lorrequer, Night
and Morning, and Old St. Paul's. The field to be reaped
is illimitable, the harvest rich.
Cruikshank's Water Colours, with introduction by Joseph
GREgo (A. & C. BLAck), is a collection of illustrations that
|recall many. A few of the very best,
have long been familiar, in black and white, to all readers of
DICKENs and AINsworth and to those who are acquainted with
W. H. MAxwell's History of the Irish Rebellion in 1798 and
Emmett's Insurrection in 1803. The special wrapper, re-
produced in this work as a frontispiece, was drawn and
coloured by GEORGE CRUIKSHANK, and was used as “an
illustrated cover to a new edition of Oliver Twist, revised
and corrected,” when re-issued in ten numbers. The Baron

a certain delicacy of tone that one is accustomed to associate

majority of CRUIKSHANK's coloured work there is a sort of
patchiness and uncertainty, yet there is scarcely one illustra-
tion that, judged from this point,
is ineffective; while, for power-

(The ladies' papers announce that unlimited tails are de rigueur on

WHY do I shun the crowded street
And choose the lonely track,
And if a friend I chance to meet
Why do I turn my back?
Because from sympathy or scorn
My shrinking spirit quails;
Because, disreputably shorn,
I've only seven tails!
Srđº. magic madness leaves me cold,
My heart is like a stone,
And preternaturally old
I slink along alone; -
My cry goes up from budding vales
To the unhearing heaven,
“Why should ELAINE have nineteen tails
While I have only seven "
Time was and that's what breaks my heart
And stabs me through and through-
I was the smartest of the smart,
I’d chic enough for two ;
And if, with creditable zest,
I'd grappled at the sales,
I might have purchased, like the rest,
A magasin of tails.

A SUGGESTION FOR THE PRESENT HUNTING SEASON IN THE MAIDEN HEAD DISTRICT.
[“The course of the River Thames is in some parts five miles wide instead of fifty yards.”—Wide Daily Papers.j
A MELO-MUDDLE DRAMA.
MEssRs. ANTHONY HoPE and HARRIson RhodEs have chosen
to describe their play of Captain Dieppe, now being per-
formed at the Duke of York's Theatre, as “a light comedy.”
A more correct description of it would be melodramatic-
farcical-comedy. The hero of this amusing muddle-drama
in three Acts is Captain Dieppe, perfectly played by Mr. H.
B. Irving. He comes on as does Captain Charles in Who
Speaks First, rendering signal service as intermediary be-
tween the husband, Count Andrea (Mr. NICHOLAs Holſhoir,
good in a difficult rôle), and the wife, Emilia (Miss MIRLAM
CLEMENTs, amusing in a less difficult rôle), whose conduct
in compromising herself with a scoundrelly adventurer, one
Paul de Roustache (or “Moustache,” which is much in
evidence, Mr. Ivo DAwson melo-dramatically gnawing at it)
will remind most playgoers of the combined indiscretions of
Mrs. Mildmay and her aunt Mrs. Sternhold in regard to
Captain Hawksley. As Guillaume Sevier, a rascally detective,
Mr. Edward O'NEILL is good, while the female detective,
Madame Sevier (reminiscent of Mrs. Bucket in Bleak House),
is cleverly, if a little too noisily, played by Miss HELEN FERRERs.
In the midst of all the bustling situations it is pleasant to be
able to congratulate Mr. Dion Boucicault on giving us, by
his rendering of the Abbé (erroneously styled “Father” in
the programme) Alfonso (this also is quite wrong unless
“Alfonso" be a surname) a few restful moments. That the
venerable Abbé cannot be entirely acquitted of causing scandal
by his patting and pawing manners with ladies, and by his
allowing them, however innocently, to rest their heads on
his shoulders, is as unfortunately true as is the fact that
the worthy Abbé, perhaps a little upset by these exceptional
familiarities, seems to have forgotten the professional manner
of imparting a blessing. In everyother respect Mr. Boucicault's
Abbé is excellent.
GOOD NEWS FOR GOOD GIRLS.
DEAR Ladies, I note with indignant distress
The way you're attacked in the sixpenny press.
There's never a weekly which doesn't contain
An article holding you up to disdain.
They sneer at your manners and gibe at your taste,
And taunt you with stupidly squeezing your waist.
They twit you with thinking . but your clothes,
And larding your maidenly converse with oaths! -
You secretly swallow your Eau de Cologne.
Your youthful complexion is seldom your own.
You gamble at Bridge in your bedroom till dawn,
And borrow from Men—if your pearls are in pawn'
You're bored and rebellious, you scheme and you plot,
You say and you do all the things you should not.
You're heartless and soulless, your minds are a slough,
And Love is a stranger to whom you won't bow!
In short, though it's certainly horribly sad,
You girls are apparently all that is bad!
But don't be despondent, for, Ladies, you see,
A morsel of comfort is left you in me!
Though cynical weeklies dissect and revile,
This heart shall still flutter whenever you smile!
To me you are ev'rything charming and good;
I'd marry you all on the spot if I could.

MANY OLD MASTERS AND THREE GRACES.
At a season of floods like the present, when water has a
bad name, it is pleasant to find something in favour of
that unpopular element. One need not travel farther than
39B, Old Bond Street, where Messrs. Thos, AGNEw AND SONS
are holding their thirty-eighth annual exhibition of water-
colour drawings. Here is the justification of water indeed!
All the great masters are represented: TURNER (one good
TURNER not only deserves another but gets many), PROUT,
DAVID Cox, and Roberts, PETER DE WINT, CotMAN, THOMAS
SIDNEY Cooper (with pictures of cows—for a change!), GIRTIN,
WILLIAM HUNT, WARLEY, BIRKET FostER, CoPLEY FIELDING, and
FRED WALKER. Most charming of the living painters who
are on exhibition is Miss M. L. Gow with a trio of large
studies of fair ladies. Fairer and more graceful Mr. Punch
never saw, and his heart is now divided into three.
THE HIGHER commeRCIAL EDUCATION.
THE only alternative advice which the opponents of Tariff
| Reform have so far offered to meet the needs of our failing
commerce is that we should improve our Technical Educa-
tion. Mr. Punch in his Business Manual supplies a long-
felt want.
To show, for instance, what may yet be done with one of
our two great basal trades (the meat and drink trades) he is
†. to give an extract from the above work, and place
ore an expectant world
MR. PUNCH's ADVICE To A YoUNG BUTCHER.
It is not easy to outline a course of training for the
embryo butcher. He will of course start with a sound
secondary education. Then we recommend him to take the
bull by the horns (we may be pardoned a trade simile) and
straight away to Argentina. Here he will spend a year
in studying the manners and customs of the ox in its native
teacup. equally long visit should be paid to New
Zealand, where the sheep can be observed in its lair. From
New Zealand the young aspirant should return in the cold-
air store of a steamer, so that he may properly note the
effects of frigidity on the animal carcase.
Now that the student has an adequate knowledge of the
whole animal (alive or dead) he should take a course of
anatomy and study dissection. Under Sir J. CRICHTON
BRowNE he will learn how to cut up anything.
Next we should indicate for the earnest butcher a conti-
nental tour in which he will observe the manners, customs,
costumes, and trade utensils of the foreign butcher, and
consider whether any of them could be advantageously
introduced into England. It is essential that he should
spend at least a }. at the Charlottenburg University
Abattoirs. He might also see in the course of i. travels if
any new animals, such as the porcupine or the armadillo,
would prove desirable additions to the British bill of fare.
Then a certain time should be devoted to the study of
languages. A butcher who knows the leading European
languages undoubtedly has a great advantage over his
competitors. Imagine the case of a British butcher who
receives an order for a leg of mutton from say Genoa, and
has no knowledge of Italian. Could anything be more calcu-
lated to check trade? French, sº Italian, and above
all German (essential to one who wishes to follow the
scientific development of butcherdom), ought to equip the
student for his life's work. Nor should the metric system
be neglected. A butcher who is able to render his bills in
grammes and kilogrammes will never be troubled with those
ruinous deductions from accounts so trying to the ordinary
practitioner.
To turn to another side of the business, a butcher who
calls at many houses and converses with many servants
ought to be a master of the art of graceful repartee. This
is to some extent a natural gift, but a study of “RITA's"
novels will greatly help the student. Then, too, he ought to
take lessons in the art of depreciation. It is often needful
on a busy Saturday evening that a butcher should pour
oratorical contempt on the wares of his rivals across the
road. Therefore a close study of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's eloquence
should be advantageous. A butcher should also not neglect
his general culture. One of the most prosperous butchers in
Hackney Road attributes his success in life entirely to the
fact that he has always been a regular reader of the
Spectator.
Perhaps the course of study we have outlined may seem
an extensive one, but it cannot be too strongly asserted that
the days of the common butcher—the “anywhere-you-like-
eightpence-Mum” butcher—are numbered. The future lies
with the scientific butcher. —

PICKY BACK.
Being the Eighth and Last Passage from the re-inconanation of
(Being 19 #j. )
The STORY OF THE LOST PICKLOCK.
THERE are some things a man never forgets. Years may
pass: a nomadic existence may find a rest in Baker Street;
Baker Street in turn may give way to more aristocratic things
and a better quarter of the town; there may be marryings
and births and buryings; any one, in fact, of the innumer-
able events to which even a comanical existence is liable may
bring its obliterating influence to bear on the mind, but
these unforgettable things, when once they have occurred,
stand out for ever with a startling and permanent distinct-
ness that none of the chances and changes of this mortal life
can ever manage to thoroughly or even partly efface or, for
the matter of that, to injuriously affect. Of such was the
adventure which, in pursuance of my duty to Holes and
humanity at large, I am about to describe.
We had been for some time past living a quiet life, dis-
turbed only by a series of telegrams from the Emperor
WILLIAM and a prolonged quest for a briar-root pipe and a
cairngorm shirt-stud (an heirloom in the Holes family), which,
as it subsequently turned out, had been abstracted and
stomachically concealed by Laura, the favourite parrot of
Mrs. Coles, our landlady. In the investigation which had
followed on the disappearance of these articles Holes had
displayed all his marvellous acumen. Never had I known
his deductivity to burn with a steadier and a more brilliant
flame. How well I recall that memorable afternoon when he
it almost shocks me to think so—to human frailties. They
may be jealous; on the other hand they may be merely
ignorant. And yet even they must have heard what un-
exampled facilities I possess for concluding wars. Potson,
do you recollect—?'
“Do Irecollect!” I interrupted. “Why, Holes, everybody
knows that you finished, absolutely and entirely finished, the
South African war months and months and months before
the army had begun to dream of peace. That has always
seemed to me one of the surest proofs of your massive and
superhuman intellect.”
Here I broke down, and sobbed like a child.
“Nay, Potson,” said Holes, patting me on the back with
one hand, while with the other he brushed away what I was
tempted to think might be the nearest approach to a tear
that had ever trickled over that thought-worn and meditative
cheek, “may, Potson, you must not repine. Though we are
not matched in brain-power—Heaven knows I did not ask
for all I have, nor did you intend to have so little—we still
have one another. Yet Iown that, things being what they
are, I am–pardon my weakness, Potson; I cannot help it—
I am lost in amazement—”
“No, no, Hol.Es,” I shrieked in anguish, “not lost. Don't
. that. Not lost. What should I do without you? Not
ost.”
But the bolt had fallen. The silver cord was broken.
The pitcher had gone to the well once too often. Apollo had
bent his bow for the last time. The last cartridge had been
expended. Holes, the mighty detective, the unequalled
discoverer of the lost, was now lost himself. He had said

Since then I have abandoned my efforts. For one in my

THE MUSE OF HISTORY.
THE value of the Limerick as a hand-
maid to history has not been sufficiently
considered by the commentators who
have ministered to its revival. Many of
the smaller yet significant phases of
modern life can find adequate record
only in its irresponsible jocundity.
Other chronicles jumble and hesitate,
doubt and stammer: the Limerick goes
straight to the point, as the following
specimens, touching events of the
moment in affairs of literature, amply
prove. They have been collected from
several sources, but the illustrious

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Essence of PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, February 22.
—Fundamental difference between House
of Lords and House of Commons brought
into strong light. On Order Paper of
former stands resolution of proportions
of one of those short speeches for which
the soul of Major RAsch yearneth. It is
fathered by Lord MUSKERRY, and pro-
poses nothing less – indeed nothing
more—than suspension of Irish Land
Act passed last year. Incited by action
of Don José, MuskERRY wants to appoint
his own Commission to inquire into the
effect of previous legislation on same
lines.
Had any eccentric Memberof Commons
conceived this notion and desired to read
a paper expounding it, he would have
found himself obliged to seek oppor-
tunity at the mouth of the ballot-box.
He might have balloted week after
week, and when, after long buffeting,
fortune favoured him, he would pro-
bably, shortly after rising, have found
himself counted out, his paper unread.
They manage these things differently
in the Lords. Any Peer, consulting
solely his own convenience, may put
down, on any night, whatsoever fantastic
º occurs to his mind as he sits in
is baronial hall. It is printed at the
expense of the nation; House sits in
full form, if not in full force; the
precious paper, from which the family
circle, the butler standing rapt at
respectful distance, have already suffered,
is ruthlessly read to the end.
That Young Fellow, WEMYSS, once
introduced pleasing variation upon
custom. Having given long notice of
KING John (of BATTERSEA).
“If I were King, I wouldn't stand it.”
Mr. J-hn B-rns's speech on the advertisement
| monstrosities near Buckingham Palace.
stupendous resolution affecting either
China or Peru, he observed on entering
House that PRIME MINISTER had not
turned up. Accordingly, postponed his
speech for a week, when the hapless
MARKiss, admitting fatuity of attempting
to evade it, more or less comfortably
slept through its delivery.
MUSKERRY not so fastidious.
KERRY family motto. So he drums away
half an hour, waking up LANSDowne on
three several occasions by audibly
snapping his fingers at Maynooth.
More than a generation passed since
introduction of that word into Parlia-
mentary debate stirred the blood. With
the fourth Baron MUSKERRY the wound
still bleeds. Is convinced that May-
nooth is at bottom of the failure of Land
Act GEORGE WYNDHAM piloted through
the Commons with natural grace and
cultured skill.
“It seems,” he says, “to have been
the object of the authors of this ma-
chinery of robbery and confiscation to
tickle the cupidity of well-to-do farmers
from whose rents Maynooth (click 1) is
recruited and provided. Maynooth
(click () is encouraged; the gentry, arti-
sans, civilisation and labour may go to
ruin.”
Almost expected the inspired orator
to drop into poetry after the manner of
RUTLAND in his salad days:
From Gentry, Art, and Labour stand aloof,
But fill, oh fill the pockets of Maynooth !
In verbatim note of passage from
speech here quoted the word in brackets
marks the explosion created by contact
between the noble Lord's thumb and
forefinger. Thing quite new in Par-
liamentary debate; wonderful effect
upon argument. Strengthened by
peculiar action attending it. Ordinary
people, when at mention of Maynooth or
other personally exasperating word they
snap their fingers, extend arm and fire
away. Possibly MUSKERRY was driven
from ordinary practice by fact that right
in front of him, solemn on the Wool-
sack, bewigged and begowned, sat the
LoRD High ChanceLLOR. Had he even
appeared to be snapping his fingers at
that dignitary, remarks would have
been made. ---.
Accordingly, whenever the word
Maynooth welled up, the indignant Peer,
turning half a pace to the right, fired
away in that direction, as if he were out
shooting in the demesne at Drumcollo-
gher and a woodcock had sped by.
When all the ammunition had been
shot away and Maynooth understood to
be riddled, MUSKERRY sat down. An
Irish Duke and eke a Baron said a few
words. Motion withdrawn. House
solemnly adjourned, not a smile having
House
nearly empty, but his manuscript full.
Forti et fideli nihil difficile is the Mus-
flickered over features of noble Lords
throughout the delightful comedy.

to suspend working of Land Act. Lord
ASHBOURNE protested that “no one with
any sense” would affirm that the Act

(The Rt. Hon. Alfr—d L-tt-lt-n)
was a failure. Lord MUSKERRY had
reiterated that assertion. Argal—but
we won't pursue the proposition.
House of Commons, Tuesday-At
Question time conversation quite Ollen-
dorfian in style. Colonial SECRETARY
stated that a person would be appointed
to China to explain to Chinamen the
nature of contracts entered into for
service in South African mines. This
followed:—
Sir H. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN. Is this person
to be all over China, or in some particular
place?
Mr. LYTTElton. He is to be in that place
where it is desirable he should be.
Mr. MACNEILL. Am I to understand that the
details of the arrangement are to be left to the
discretion of Lord MilNER 2
Mr. Lyttelton. No, Sir; you must not under-
stand that.
Mr. MACNEILL. Then I do understand it.
Ever since the MEMBER FOR SARK has

know something about Naval affairs.
He has, in fact, reviewed the fleet From
a Conning Tower. He is, accordingly,
sent to take charge of the War Office.
Then there is Captain PRETYMAN. He
is a man of war, has smelt powder fired
on Royal birthdays and the like by
the Royal Suffolk Volunteer Artillery.
Whenever in past days Army matters
were to the fore, be sure the gallant
captain would be around putting things
right.
“The very man for the Navy,” says
PRINCE ARTHUR, regarding him critically.
So the honorary Colonel of the First
Suffolk Volunteer Artillery is made Civil
Lord of the Admiralty. Thus are the
Services brought into closer touch. To-
day it fell to PRETYMAN's lot to defend
the Navy Estimates, which include
purchase money of two Chilian war
vessels.
Last March, when subject before
House, PRINCE ARTHUR scorned sugges-
tion that these vessels, then in the
market, should be bought. They were,
he insisted, in every way unsuitable for
brotherhood of the British Fleet. Now,
at a price reaching a million and three-
quarters sterling, they have been ac-
quired. How is this, Committee wants
to know.
PRINCE ARTHUR not here to explain. If
he were, he might recall BENEDICK's re-
mark when charged with inconsistency:
“When I said I would die a bachelor,
I did not think that I should live till
I were married.”
So PRINCE ARTHUR: “When I said I
would not have these Chilian vessels as
a gift, I did not think I should live to
give £1,875,000 for them.”
In his absence PRETYMAN volubly
explains that the transaction is really an
economy. Suppose we hadn't bought
them, some other nation would. There-
upon we should have had to build two
others, which would have cost at least
a couple of millions. Transaction there-
fore actually puts a quarter of a million
sterling into the pocket of British tax-
payer.
n matters of domestic finance Wilkins
Micawber not in it with ERNEST GEORGE
PRETYMAN, late Captain in the Royal
Artillery. “Annual income twenty
pounds, annual expenditure nineteen
nineteen six, result happiness. Annual
income twenty pounds, annual expendi-
ture twenty pounds nought and six;
result misery.”
Compare with that PRETYMAN's econo-
mical dictum and see how trifling was
Mr. Micawber's.
“Two war ships cost two millions
sterling. Buy them for one million
eight hundred and seventy-five thousand
pounds no shillings and pence, and
you collar for the working-man (whose
and twenty-five thousand pounds no
shillings and pence. Result, return of
Government with increased majority.”

now at the Admiralty, comes out in new
character as authority on finance.

among the great of the earth. A simple-
minded, shrewd-headed, kind-hearted
man, he shrank from the cheap publicity
of the Question hour, never wasted time
of House by prosy or argumentative
speech. Still I venture to think his
last recorded words, in respect of their
sublime unselfishness, the rare considera-
tion for others at the awful moment
when humanity is usually concerned for
itself, are worthy of record. Only to-
day I hear of them from his old Harrow
housemate, the SECRETARY FOR Scotland.
“Don’t bury me on Thursday,” PENN
whispered, the hand of Death already
upon him. “There is a little girl oppo-
site going to be married on that day,
and it would be gruesome.”
The little girl opposite was the
daughter of Sir WEETMAN and Lady
PEARSON, now Lady DENMAN. As far as
I know, PENN was not personally ac-
quainted with the family on the opposite
side of Carlton House Terrace. But he
had heard of the coming marriage, and,
deep in the shadow of the Walley of
Death, his first thought, as it had been
through his lifetime, was for others.

GOLF AND GOOD FORM.
(By the Expert Wrinkler.)
Is it good form to golf? That is a
question I have been so repeatedly
asked of late by correspondents that
I can no longer postpone my answer.
Now to begin with, I fear there is no
doubt that golf is a little on the down
grade—socially. Golf is no longer the
monopoly of the best set, and I am
told that artisans' Clubs have actually
been started in certain districts. The
other day, as I was travelling in Lanca-
shire, a man in the same compartment—
with the most shockingly ill-cut trousers
I ever saw—said to a friend, “I like
'Oylake, it's 'ealthy, and it's 'andy and
within 'ail of 'ome.” And it turned
out that the chief attraction to him at
Hoylake was the golf. Such an incident
as this speaks volumes. But I always
try to see both sides of every question,
and there is unquestionably a great deal
to be said in favour of golf. It was un-
doubtedly played by Kings in the past,
and at the present moment is patronised
by Grand Dukes, Dukes, Peers and
Premiers.
GoLF AND DRESS.
But the real and abiding attraction
of golf is that it mercifully gives more
opportunities to the dressy man than
any other pastime. Football and
cricket reduce every one to a dead level
in dress, but in golf there is any
amount of scope for individuality in
costume. Take the case of colour alone.
The other day at Finsbury Park station
I met a friend on his way home from
a day's golfing, and I noticed that he
was sporting the colours of no fewer
than five different Clubs. On his cap
was the badge of the Camberwell
Crusaders: his tie proved his member-
ship of the Bickley Authentics: his
blazer was that of the Tulse Hill Non-
descripts; his brass waistcoat buttons
bore the monogram of the Gipsy Hill
Zingari; the roll of his knickerbocker
stockings was embroidered with the
crest of the Kilburn Incogs. The effect
of the whole was, if I may be allowed
the word, spicy in the extreme. Of
course it is not everyone who can carry
off such a combination, or who can
afford to belong to so many first-class
Clubs. But my friend is a very hand-
some man, and has a handicap of plus
two at Tooting Bec.
KNICKERBOCKERS or TROUSERs.
The burning question which divides
golfers into two hostile camps is the
choice between knickerbockers and trou-
sers. Personally I favour the latter,
but it is only right to explain that ever
since I was gaffed in the leg by my
friend Wiscount when out cub-
sticking with the Cottesmore I have
never donned knickers again. To a
man with a really well-turned calf and
neat ankles I should say, wear knicker-
bockers whenever you get a chance.
The late Lord SEPTIMUs Boulger, who
had very thick legs, and calves that
seemed to begin just above the ankles,
used to wear knickerbockers because he
said it put his opponent off his play.
If I may say so without offence he was
a real funny chap, though a careless
dresser, and I am told that his father,
( -
QUOTATIONS GONE WRONG.
“LIFE HAS PASSED
WITH ME BUT ROUGHLY SINCE I HEARD THEE LAST.”
Cowper.
old Lord SPALDING, has never been the
same man since his death.
Stockings AND CALVES.
Another advantage of knickerbockers
is the scope they afford for the display
of stylish stockings. A very good effect
is produced by having a little red tuft,
which should appear under the roll
which surmounts the calf. The roll
itself, which should always have a
smart pattern, is very useful in convey-
ing the impression that the calf is more
fully developed than it really is._I
noticed the other day at Hanger Hill
that Sir ARLINGTON BALL was playing
in a pair of very full knickers,
almost of the Dutch cut, and that his
stockings—of a plain brown colour—
had no roll such as I have described.
Then of course Sir ARLINGTON has an
exceptionally well-modelled calf, and
when in addition a man has £30,000 a
year he may be allowed a certain latitude
in his dress and his conduct generally.
º Boots AND SHOEs.
The question of footwear at golf is
one of considerable difficulty, but there
is a general feeling in favour of shoes.
Myfriend the Tooting Bec plusser affects
a very showy sort of shoe with a wide
welt and a sort of fringe of narrow
strips of porpoise hide, which fall over
the instep in a miniature cataract.
As regards the rival merits of india
rubber studs on the soles and of nails,
I compromise by a judicious mixture of
both. If a waistcoat be worn it should
be of the brightest possible colour. I
saw Lord DUNCHING the other day at
Wimbledon Park in a charming waist-
coat. The groundwork was a rich
spinach green with discs of Pompeian
red, and the buttons were of brass with
his monogram in blue and white enamel
in the centre. As it was a cold day he
wore a mustard-coloured Harris tweed
Norfolk jacket and a sealskin cap. Quite
a large crowd followed him, and I heard
afterwards that he had raised the record
for the links to 193.
QUALIFICATIONS FOR A WALET.
One thing is certain—and that is we
cannot all be first-class players. Per-
sonally, owing to the accident I have
already referred to, I hardly ever play
at all, but I always make it a point, if
I am going on a visit to any place in
the country where I know there are no
golf links, to take a few niblicks with
me. A bag for clubs only costs a few
shillings, and it looks well amongst your
other paraphernalia on a journey. In
engaging a valet, again, always remem-
ber to ascertain whether he knows the
rules of the “royal and ancient game.”
I shall never forget my humiliation when
down at Lord SPRINGVALE's. As I was
taking part in a foursome with the
Hon. AGRIPPA BRAMBLE, Lady HoRACE
HILTON, and the Second Mrs. BUNKERAY,
I got stuck in a furze-bush and my man
handed me a putter. I could have
cried with vexation.

is doomed; and that we must therefore cease
to eat at home and to entertain, and dispense
with cooking-pots, if we would achieve any-
thing.)
UP, up, revolting daughters! What!
Are ye content that life
Should be a thing of pan and pot,
A round of fork and knife?
Are ye content, O slaves, to bear
With furrowed brow and thinning hair
The drudgery of household care,
The burden of the wife?
Up, sisters, up ! The fault's your own
If many a wasted span
Is spent slave-driving greasy JoAN
And idle MARY ANN.
Why meditate through half the night
New dishes, succulent and light,
To tempt the pampered appetite
Of over-eaten man?
No! Let him feed, if feed he must,
Upon the mid-day steak,
So that at eve some simple crust
Sufficient meal may make;
And he no doubt in time will learn
To eye with joy on his return
The simple tea-pot, caddy, urn,
And slice of seedy cake.
Thus, too, your sons shall come to view
All gluttony with scorn;
Indulgence shall be held taboo,
And luxury forsworn;
Nor shall a race be bred to vex
Our much-abused, long-suffering sex,
And with their greedy wants perplex
Girl-babies yet unborn.
Why entertain? Or if you care
To see your friends at all,
Why not let every street and square
Have its reception hall?
A simple room which one can sluice
With disinfectants after use,
With floor of stone or well-scrubbed
spruce
And tiles upon the wall.
Then up, my sisters! Only think—
To be forever free
From kitchen, pantry, larder, sink—
Eternal drudgery !
Pack all our cares to Jericho,
And how serenely life will flow !

AN IMPERIAL POLICY.
THAt the rôle of Ruy Blas, the hero of WICTOR HUGo's
romantic melodrama, should have attracted Mr. LEwis WALLER,
as aforetime it attracted FECHTER, is quite in the nature of
things; but it is a pity that Mr. WALLER should not have been
contented with the old play, which, cut and polished up,
might have proved a gem of some value.
At the Imperial Theatre the scenic artists, Messrs. BANKs,
HICKs and CRAVEN, have done their best for Mr. John DAVID-
SON's version of Ruy Blas entitled A Queen's Romance. It
would have been better for the action had some little licence
in the matter of dress been permitted to Mrs. PATRICK
CAMPBELL as The Queen of Spain, to Miss Lydia THOMPson as
the Duchess of Albuquerque, and to many of the ladies of the
Court, who, attired as they now are, can only give such pla
to their feelings as extensive hoops and heavy petticoats wi
allow. The Queen is a perfect “Court Circular ” in herself.
Her devoted Ruy Blas may get round her with far greater
facility than he can get at her. It may be that this is why
her imprisoned Majesty, herself under petticoat government,
seems to be so peculiarly bored by the attentions of her
desperate adorer. How delighted would all the Spanish
Court of the Imperial Theatre be even now, if over the doors
were inscribed “All hoops abandon ye who enter here !”
Of such telling situations as this “blank version” offers
to the actor, Mr. LEwis WALLER makes the most, and in the
last scene of all that closes the tragedy of the lunatic Fortnightly Review for last month. The
lacquey's strange career Mr. WALLER puts forth all his
power, touches our hearts, excites our sympathy, and leaves
nothing to be desired, except that all the previous material
had permitted acting such as this.
Mr. FULTON's Don Salluste is even more melodramatic than
VICTOR-HUGO-DAVIDSON's double-dyed stage villain. It is like
Mr. WALDENGARVER's Hamlet, “massive and concrete.” Mr.
THOMAS KINGSTON is fortunate in being cast for the delightful
rôle of the always popular Don César de Bazan.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
SIR HoRACE PLUNKETT's work on Ireland (John MURRAY)
is the most valuable contribution to the understanding of
a vital and complex question issued for some time. Long
before he, with suitability of person to post not a prominent
feature in all Ministerial appointments, was placed at the
head of the Irish Agricultural Department, Sir HoRACE,
in modest practical manner, grappled with the subject.
He perceived that at the root of the matter was the desira-
bility of agricultural co-operation through voluntary associa-
tions. The gospel he preaches is that Ireland must work
out her own salvation; at the same time he is not above
recognising the necessity of supplementing voluntary effort
by a sound system of state aid to agriculture and other
industries. §. by agriculture alone is Ireland to be
saved. “The best way to stimulate our industries,” writes
Sir HoRACE in two of the many wise sentences that illuminate
his book, “is to develop the home market by means of
an increased agricultural production and a higher standard
of comfort among the peasant producers. We shall thus
be operating upon agriculture on the side of consumption
as well as production, and so increasing the home demand
for Irish manufactures.” My Baronite, with pretty intimate
knowledge of the history and moulding of the Irish Land
Bill, recognises its founder in the Vice-President of the Irish
Agricultural Board. GEORGE WYNDHAM watered, but HoRACE
PLUNKETT planted. His establishment of the Irish Agricul-
tural Organisation Society demonstrated the truth of his
axiom, “Ireland is to re-created from within. No
body of men at Westminster, though they may help or
hinder, can do the main work.”
The Baron begs to acknowledge the fourth edition of the
Hindi Punch, just received from Bombay. Mr. Punch, who
traces his own origin back to prehistoric times when the
Pharaohs and such like moderns were neither born northought
of, when all the world was young, as Mr. Punch himself ever
remains, is delighted to find his family so well represented
and so highly popular in India as from this volume of the
Hindi Punch is evidently the case. It is brought right up
to date, and shows jº, how thoroughly The Hind and
Brahmin Punchoda agree, and what useful service, wherever
refºrm is needed, our Indian cousin is always ready and
willing to render. In some instances he appears to be a
very hot Punch, steaming in fact, but that is a matter of
climate. The Baron tenders congratulations on the present
volume, and, on behalf of Mr. Punch himself, wishes Hindi
Punch continued success in the future.
This fresh edition of Adonais (METHUEN) is a dainty dish to
lay before any king. It is fresh only in the sense of being
just printed, since it is an exact reprint, page for page, not
omitting the errors, of the edition of 1821 published at Pisa
“with the types of DiDoT.” My Baronite reads Adonais
whenever he finds it at hand. In this charming edition,
frocked in pale blue, he finds fresh delight.
What can be dome to help the British Stage was the plaintive
heading of an article by Mr. W. L. Court.NEY” in the
uestion was em-
phasised not only by quotations from a '. written by
Mr. John HARE to the Times, but also by an excerpt from a
lecture recently delivered by Mr. PINEno; but the appeal
was scarcely strengthened by a letter from Mr. FREDERick
HARRISON (not to be confounded with Mr. MAUDE's partner in
the Haymarket management), whose claim to be regarded as
an authority on theatrical matters has yet to be allowed.
The Baron would be inclined to surmise, in the absence of
any evidence to the contrary, that Mr. HARRison's acquaint-
ance with theatrical matters in England is probably limited
to the circumstance, as he has here stated it, of his having
once upon a time written “a piece” (the Baron supposes
he means a play) with, apparently, a purpose. What has
become of this immortal work? #. erudite Baron is com-
pelled to confess, with compunction, his entire ignorance of
the very existence of this literary and dramatic treasure. It
may have been published anonymously, as anonymity has
been on one occasion at least, of which the Baron happens to
be cognisant, adopted by the philosophic Mr. FREDERick
HARRISON. . If however by “piece” he did not mean a play,
what was it, and why was it referred to in this connection?
The Poet Laureate of course has made his début under
Mr. TREE's auspices as a dramatic author, and there are, we
take it, not many playgoers who, having once seen our ALFRED's
Flodden. Field during its not extraordinarily prolonged
run at His Majesty's, are likely to forget it. i. the March
number of the Fortnightly i. appears a second list
of thirty-seven “signatories” of whom only a dozen names
can fairly be cited as practical
experts. But what is it that
these worthy “signatories” (we
allude to such names amon
them as are not usually º
with the drama) require? What- /
ever it may be, had not the ſº:
entire subject better be left to
experienced professional actors,
with Sir HENRY IRVING as their
president, who thoroughly know
the public, and will be univer-
sally recognised as authorities in
such a matter?

THE, DECLINE AND FALL-OFF.
AMONG traditions which explain
Our wonted lordship o'er the waves,
And why we steadily disdain
The bare idea of being slaves,
There is a dictum, taught, no doubt,
Upon the playing-fields of Eton,
That Britain's sons are born without
The gift of knowing when they're beaten.
Whether it ought to be ascribed
To qualities of heart or head—
This virtue which we see imbibed
By every bull-pup nicely bred—
Who knows? It may be simply beans
Or due to mental limitations
Imposed by Providential means
On insular imaginations.
I must regrettably omit
To trace the ethnologic germ
Of that hereditary grit
Which keeps #. country's bulwarks firm;
Suffice to note, this racial trait
That won us our superb position
Shows signs of comatose decay
In certain types of politician.
Not theirs to fight forlornly on,
Filling the gaps where comrades fall,
And last, with ammunition gone,
To leave their bodies by the wall;
They recognise long months ahead
In what direction things are drifting,
And while their Captain counts his dead
Secure an early chance of shifting.
LetWTHOMAS ATKINs, blind with pluck,
Firmly decline to own defeat;
These warriors scent a lapse of luck
Almost before the armies meet.
Let JACK at sea, good simple soul,
With riddled pumps sublimely wrestle;
These tars assume the softer rôle
Of rats that leave a sinking vessel.
“Tall talk,” you say, “and vainly spent;
Heroics hardly meet the case
Of such as look on Parliament
As just a pleasant lounging-place—
A club, with stiffish entrance-fee,
But social standard lightly lenient,
Where men may saunter in to tea
And vote at leisure, if convenient.
“It little moves them how the State
Emerges from the strife of tongues,
If they can once negotiate
Society's initial rungs;
Though Tory fortunes rudely swerve,
Still in provincial vales of Tempé
These heroes, flushed with Attic verve,
At worst can sign themselves ex-M.P.”
That is their point of view, you say.
But was the House, through which they flit,
Constructed, like the Sabbath day,
Largely for them, or they for it?
This common type, I hold, exists
For single ºl. of which the sum is
To swell their party's voting lists
As loyal unassuming dummies.”

A LETTER OF CONDOLENCE.
(Fragment of the diary of Mamie Harding, typewriter to a Man
of Genius.)
Feb. 5.-I put on his table this morning a personal letter
I opened by mistake. It said, among other things: “So
poor Tom JACKson's lost his wife. The baby did not live
either, I'm told.” When he came in he read as far as this.
| Then he said, sadly: “You may go, Miss HARDING; I shall
not dictate any poetry to-day. For me there is a mournful,
beneficent, gracious task.”
Feb. 6.-His room was in disorder this morning. Heaps
of torn paper lay on the table, on the floor, everywhere. ... He
looked noble when he came in. “These little papers,” he
said, with such a wave of his hand, “are to be counted
among my failures. But I have achieved it—a letter of con-
dolence, as the world says, to poor JACKSON.” I said some-
thing about giving up to one person the talent meant for the
world. He answered : “Little girl, little girl, how shall I
make you understand? To JACKSON his grief is not precious.
To him his loss is an unlovely thing, merely hard to bear.
My duty is to send him words which, though heregards them
not now, nor at all perceives their savour, shall in after years
be taken to the light, like glowing gems from their case;
when JACKSON, rereading them, shall realise that death, even
death, is susceptible of a treatment essentially decorative.”
Taking a bit of manuscript from his pocket, he added:
“As for the world, my biographers may fight for this copy.”
He leaned against the mantelpiece, his head resting on his
hand, and read aloud: “In the presence of such misery as
yours no words of mine, with however true a sympathy they
are spoken, can sound aught save a discord in your ears.
You loved ELINOR: you have lost her. Faint indeed, my
friend, faint and fading, thin and distant echoes of a grief
that smites and slays, will be anything that I can add. To
the tones of my answering sorrow you can give no more heed
than the traveller, stricken by the swift irrevocable bolt of
the gods, pays to the reverberations of that flash which
brought him suddenly to the end of things.” He sighed
a little, shook his head, and said two or three times: “Death
itself, to the artist, may be an occasion for tender arabesques.”
It was hard, but I did it. I said, of course in my refined
way: “Yes, it's a very pretty piece”—he shuddered a little,
I don't know why—“but I don't quite understand. How
could a man who'd been killed by lightning pay attention to
the thunder, even if he wanted to ?”
As soon as he caught the idea he dashed off this wire:
“THOMAS JACKSON, The Parentage, Little Mitching, Sturton
Sowley, Salop. Confidential letter intended for another
mailed you by mistake. Please return unopened. Sincerest
sympathy. Will write. —WARwick PAPRICOT.” For the rest of
the day he was inattentive and melancholy.
Feb. 8.-I was the witness of a distressing scene this
morning. He was dictating a poem, a really superior one,
in praise of common persons, and had just intoned the line,
“Glory of Smith in the morning, and glory of Jones at night,”
when there was a noise in the passage, and a young man
tumbled into the room —a sort of Squire, I expect, with an
out-of-door skin, and jolly eyes. He pounded Mr. PAPRicot
|on the back. Mr. PAPRICOT looked dignified, and said, “But,
my poor JAckson, how--—?”
But Mr. JAckson wouldn't let him finish. “I say! I say!
he shouted. “Great, isn't it? Sorry, old man, but I opened
your letter—came before the wire. Rattling good letter—you
must have worked uncommon hard. But NELLY's not dead.
º: fine! Twins! All three well.” And he poked Mr.

which.

Editor of the “Nineteenth Century and

paying for papers in kind?
Mr. Balfour. You mean half bricks,
for example?
Editor of the “Economist.” I am even
now perfecting a scheme by which to-
day's halfpenny paper can be exchanged
for yesterday's penny paper. For
example, a Telegraph of March 2 would
purchase a Chronicle of March 3, or a

Mr. A. J. Balfour. I have
been asked to take the chair
at the interesting debate which
is about to ensue, for thereason
that absolute impartiality
could be found only in one
who never reads the papers.
As I am in that enviable posi-
tion it follows that it is all one
to me whether they cost a
halfpenny or a king's ransom.
So far as I can see, however, a
halfpenny is the prevailing
sum; yet, on my attempting

The scheme seems to be an
admirable one.
Editor of the “Economist.”
So I think. My only difficulty
so far has been with Messrs.
W. H. SMITH AND SONs and
the other newsagents. Pay-
ment might also be made in
comestibles, especially such as
are available at breakfast-time.
It would be very convenient,
for instance, to be able to
purchase four Mirrors with
an egg, or to exchange a
sardine for the Morning Post.
It would help to solve the
question what to do with
superfluous breakfast.
Master of the Mint. Another

introduced signed articles, but our enter-
prise will go no further just yet, unless
to return to anonymity.
Editor of the “Nineteenth Century and

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday might,
February 29.--Talk through long winter
night all about the Navy. Everything
going well. We’ve got the men, we've
got the ships, and we’ve paid the money
too. Three years ago total of Naval
expenditure slightly exceeded thirty-two
millions. Estimated outlay for coming
year demands forty-two millions. Pretty
stiff for peace establishment. But tax-
payer satisfied if only assured he gets
something for his money. As Fortescue
FLANNERY said just now, in one of those
trumpet-toned sentences that hurtle
through the shivering ages, “What is an
excessive Budget compared with safety
of the country?”
This one for C.-B., who had been
hinting that we are rather going it in
the matter of national expenditure.
Happily proof forthcoming that the
Navy is not only in healthy contented
state of mind that would have amazed
the mutineers of the Nore, but that it
is impregnated to its lowest depths
with spirit of loyalty worth more
than a Chilian ironclad in the hour of
battle. Testimony all the more valu-
able that it cropped up on side issues,
and was incidentally mentioned by
Secretary to Admiralty. Discoursing of
the educational establishment of late-
created Osborne, PRETYMAN told how he
had been approached by a grateful
mother who, showing alarming intention
“Chii IAN BATTLEShips.”
The designer of H.M.S. Swiftsure and
Triumph describes his offspring to the House

of desire to embrace him, descanted on
the happiness of her cadet.
“Why,” she exclaimed, “he has cream
with his porridge!”
There, in a sentence, is explained the
secret of the prowess of the British Navy.
Budding midshipmites have cream with
their porridge. Whether it were wise
thus to blurt out secrets, with France,
Germany and Russia listening at the
door, is matter for consideration of
Board of Admiralty. Anyhow it is out
now. If, next year, our rivals shall
have so far profited by the lesson that
it will be necessary to increase existin
proportion of strength to meet .
that Great Britain shall be as powerful
on the sea as any possible combination
of two maritime Powers, with
will rest responsibility.
The other testimony also came from
Osborne, seed-ground of dauntless'
Amirals. A cadet, asked to name the
three greatest Admirals known to
history, promptly replied, “NELSoN,
BLAKE and the Earl of SELBoRNE.” House
laughed long and loud when PRETYMAN
told the story. If we come to think of
it we shall discern deeper meaning in it
than appears at first glance. Small boy
of course inaccurate in point of form.
There is a difference between the First
Lord of the Admiralty and a mere
Admiral like NELSON or CHARLIE
BERESFORD.
As a matter of fact, in accordance
with far-sighted policy alluded to last
week, our present First Lord learned
the art of war ashore. Before he went
to the Admiralty he was accustomed to
set in battle array the third battalion of
the Hampshire Militia.
That is a detail. Wiping lips still
succulent with cream in his porridge;
confronted by the query, Who are the
three greatest Admirals 2 having named
NELSON and BLAKE, the small cadet's
mind was permeated with the subtle
personal influence of the head of the
King's Navee, a personality felt from
the flagship to the tiniest torpedo-boat.
Naturally the name of SELBORNE leaped
to his tongue.
The youngster was quite right. Of
all Departments affected by reconstruc-
tion of Ministry of 1900, none has been
so successfully administered as the
Admiralty. Whilst squabbles have
raged round every other, healthful peace
has brooded over Spring Gardens.

HINTS ON SMOKING.
(By the Expert Wrinkler.)
My weekly budget of correspondence
brings me many letters which I am
unable to answer in detail. Now and
again, however, a point of such vital
interest is raised that I can not, in my
capacity of trustee of public manners,
. a definite pronouncement.
Such, for instance, is the query put to
me by “Dindigul”—Is it good form
not to smoke? Of course there are some
people who can't smoke, and ought not
to be blamed for it. For instance, there
was my friend Lord ERNEST CoNKLETON,
a very bright and sociable fellow, who
had such an extraordinarily aquiline
nose that he could not smoke a cigar or
tiº. without burning the tip of it
—I mean his nose. Then I have known
some very nice fellows, occupying
excellent positions in society, good solo-
whist players, thoroughly well-dressed
and honourable men, ". either honestly
didn't like tobacco or with whom it
completely disagreed. These, however,
are only the exceptions that prove the
rule. Smoking is not only a sign of
manliness, and a sociable habit, but it
sets off a man, in certain surroundings,
almost as well as a good hat or a well-
tied tie. But here, as in everything else,
noblesse oblige, and a refined man of
fashion must not only be careful what
he smokes, but how and where he
indulges in the habit. Anyone may
smoke shag on a desert island, but even
Dukes abstain from anything stronger
than a cigarette in the breakfast parlour.
Some famous author once remarked that
brandy was the drink for heroes. Well,
to adapt the phrase, I should be inclined
to say that cigars are the smoke for
gentlemen. But, of course, we must cut
our coat according to our cloth. One of
the saddest things in life, as I have
often remarked, is that the most refined
men are often hampered by limited
incomes. Or, to put it in a more con-
crete form, many a man who is worthy
of the finest Magnifico Pomposos is
obliged to put up with “Dutchmen,”
twopenny cheroots, or Burmah cigars.
The DANGERs of PIPE-SMOKING.
Much greater latitude prevails in
regard to smoking in the streets than
when I was a boy, but the line must still
be drawn at pipes. A cigarette or even
a cigar is permissible in Bond Street,
but a pipe—never. My friend Baron
ZELTINGER, a very good fellow, but
strangely absent-minded at times, was
pilled at the National Liberal Club for
no other reason that I could ever find
out than that he had been seen smoking
a meerschaum in Pall Mall. The dis-
appointment quite broke him up, and
he shortly afterwards married the
daughter of a bath-chair proprietor,
became a vegetarian, and now goes
about in hygienic homespun. Imerely
mention this to show what disasters may
happen to a man if he does not regulate
tastes in accordance with the require-
ments of good form. A pipe is all very
well for the privacy of home, but for
smoking in public the cigar or gold-
tipped cigarette is de rigueur.
CIGARETTEs—Home-MADE AND OTHERWISE.
Personally I don't mind confessin
that I roll most of my cigarettes myself,
but I never do it in public. The only

serious drawback is that you can't buy
gold-tipped cigarette papers. I tried
once painting the papers with gold, but
it wouldn't dry, and came off on my lip
without my noticing it. When I turned
up in the smoke-room of the Junior
Commercial Travellers' Club that even-
ing you can imagine I was properly
chaffed. If, then, you prefer to buy
your cigarettes ready made, you can get
a very serviceable article at the rate of
about three a penny if you buy them by
the ounce. Personally I prefer to buy
them in large quantities, and can cordially
recommend DiAMANTopoulo's Lion-tamers
at twenty shillings a thousand. The
objection to most cigarettes is that you
can go on smoking them indefinitely;
but I have never seen any man smoke
more than three Lion-tamers on end.
Besides, they are invaluable in a small
conservatory from their insecticidal
qualities. Green fly may defy a green
cigar, but they simply curl up at the
mention of DIAMANTopoulo. I admit that
they aren't universally appreciated, and
old Lady HUBBLEThwaite, who smokes
like a chimney, when I offered her my
case the other day, replied, very rudely as
I thought, “No, thanks—I like smoking,
but I don't care about being fumigated."
Other reasonable brands of cigarettes
that I can recommend are the halfpenny
Pecksniffs, the Noracreinis, an excellent
Irish brand, and MANGold's Ensilage
Mixture cigarette, sold in packets of
thirty for sixpence, but not to be had
at the Carlton for love or money.
USEFUL ECONOMIES.
A good device is carefully to pre-
serve the paper bands—or “waistcoats,"
as a funny friend of mine insists on
calling them—of really first-rate cigars,
and then transfer them to weeds of
inferior calibre. My firm impression is
that in these matters imagination goes
a long way, and that if you give a man
a twopenny Borneo wrapped in silver
paper with the waistcoat of an Absolute
Flora he will discover in it all the fine
qualities of a half-crown cigar. Another
device of my own invention is that by
which a cigar of ordinary dimensions
may be lengthened so as to simulate a
six or eight-inch Intimidad. My plan is
to cut the cigar in half, and connect the
two halves with a wooden tube, which is
concealed by a coloured and gilt paper
band of exceptional width. hen the
top end is nearly consumed you can
either substitute a half-smoked cigar
from your cupboard and begin again,
1 or else remove the tube and finish
off the second half without any further
disguise. Remember also that cigar ash
is a useful substitute for blotting paper.
ANswers to CoRRESPONDENTs.

TAB, Woking.—(1) The correct form
is “Won't you have a cigarette?” not
“May I offer you a cig. 2” (2) The
accent is on the second syllable of
cheroot.
STRAIGHT-cut, MAYFAIR.—Embroidered
smoking-caps with a tassel are no longer
worn by the best people, but if your
fiancée has already made you one, it
will always come in handy at private
theatricals.
Romeo.—Your objection to the Invisi-
ble Trousers Stretcher, that if trousers
are invisible they do not need to be
stretched, is not valid. The word
invisible applies to the stretching
machine.

LITTLE ARTICLES BY GREAT MEN.
I.-Do we TAKE our AMUSEMENTs seriously ENOUGH2
(By Mr. C. B. F • *)
THE frivolity of the British people is to my mind the
saddest sign of the age. I shall never forget the shock with
which I saw a newspaper bill when MACIAREN (great-hearted
MAC) was struggling against Australia. The placard had in
huge letters the words, “British Disaster.” With trembling
hands I purchased a paper, and turned nervously to the
cricket columns. Nothing was there. I turned to the stop-
press news and found that this catchpenny bill was due to
nothing more than the cutting up of a troop of Yeomanry by
the Boers. From the fuss made one would have thought
that the Adelaide pitch had been cut up. The frivolity of
the Press is only paralleled by the frivolity of the public.
Take the light and airy way in which the spectators at our
great cricket grounds treat the imposing functions provided
for them. Suppose little (but heroic) John NY TYLDESLEY runs
out to that wily, curling ball which sunny-faced Wilfred
RhodEs pitches thirty-three and t uarter inches from the
block. Up glides his trusty willow, and a fortieth of a second
after the hi has pitched descends on the leather. With a
wonderful flick of the elbow he chops the ball exactly
between square leg and point. Is the raucous “Well hit, &º

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A Little more than twelve months ago my Baronite, visiting
Trinidad, chanced
4ſº
to come across a meanly-printed book
giving an account of an expedition up
the Caura affluent of the Orinoco. The
... marrative had apparently been published
3 in a local newspaper, the type, divided
into paged spaces, printed on rough
paper and cheaply bound. Full many
# a gem of purest ray serene the dark
unfathomed caves of ocean bear. My
Baronite speedily discovered the treasure
hidden in this unalluring shape. He
wrote a notice of the work in this
column, hinting that a London publisher
would do well to look it up. Messrs.
-" SMITH, ELDER took the tip, and have
reproduced the narrative in a handsome volume, with
thirty-four illustrations and a map. The author is still a
young man, EUGENE ANDRé by name. In his book, A
Naturalist in the Guianas, will be found a notable addition
not only to geographical knowledge and incidents of personal
adventure, but to rare information of hitherto unknown
birds that swarm in the pathless forests of Venezuela.
For well-constructed plot, for picturesquely descriptive
writing of a high order, for clear narrative, sustained and
all-absorbing interest, for dramatic dialogue and tragic action,
Strong §. S. R. CROCKETT (WARD AND Lock), stands well
at the head of the very best novels published within the last
twelve months, though the broad Scotch dialect is a hard
nut for a southern Englishman to crack, and he may break
some of his teeth in any rash attempt to read it aloud. To
all novel readers and lovers of good literature this exceptional
romance is strongly recommended by the Baron. One word
as to the clever illustrations by MAURICE GRIFFENHAGEN. In very
few instances does the picture face the scene it is intended
to illustrate; either it is in advance of, or after, the event.
This placing is inartistic. A reader does not want to be
told pictorially of what is going to happen three pages
ahead; nor, having mastered the situation, does he feel the
slightest interest in seeing it pictorially represented some
pages after he has done with it. Again, the composition
and execution must to a certain extent suffer from the formal
compression to which the artist has bound himself hard and
fast, so that most of the pictures suggest the simile of an
attempt to place, within the narrow ‘. of the Theatre
Royal back-drawing-room, scenes that to be really effective
ºl. have had i. stage of Drury Lane entirely to them-
Selves.
“Most people know a flounder,” writes Sir HERBERT
Maxwell in his British Fresh Water Fishes, just added by
Messrs. Hutchinson to the Woburn Library of Natural
History edited by the Duke of BEDFord. My Baronite
blushes with conscious pride at this assumption on the
part of a high authority that he, among others, possesses
this gift of discernment. Truth compels him to admit that
he is most familiar with the fish when souché, and is not
quite certain he would recognise it if he met it off the coast.
He is therefore gratified to learn that inaccuracy on the
point is not singular. “On the west coast of Scotland,”
Sir HERBERT testifies, “the flounder is known as the fluke,
and the term flounder is applied popularly to quite a different
fish, the plaice.” This is a mere detail, a speck on the Milky
Way of knowledge possessed by the Admirable CRICHTON recog-
nised in the House of Commons as the Member for Wigtonshire.
Sir HERBERT's range of information, wide and deep, is happily
equalled by his industry. Only the other day he edited a
book which for personal and political interest vies with the
Greville Memoirs. To-day one comes upon him mermanning
in British rivers, airing his acquaintance with the ancient
perch family, distinguishing between the three-spined
stickleback and its ten-spined kinsman, saying a good
word for the gudgeon, glancing en passant at the shad,
the eel, and the lamprey, and shedding vivid light upon
salmon problems. Sir HERBERT is appalling learned. Withal
he has the gift of making the simple understand.
The Baron, who is only too happy to be able to recommend
to his readers the distraction of a really stirring sensational
novel, regrets being unable to do more than give considerably
ualified praise to Room Five, by M. HAMILTON DRUMMOND
(WARD, Lock & Co.). His picture of the village doctor is
clever, and his graphic description of the shipwreck is
excellent. The commencement of the story promises well,
but the performance is not equal to the promise.
In this tenth number of the Great Masters (HEINEMANN,
London; HACHETTE, Paris &c.) that has just appeared, the first
picture, by NICHOLAS MAES, entitled An Old Woman saying
Grace, beautifully reproduced, is, in the Baron's opinion,
were it standing alone, in itself full value for the
price, “the ridiculously small sum of five shillings,” for
which can be purchased any one of the numbers in this
series. The homely pathos and piety of it—and 'tis not a
matter of meat-piety, as it is evidently merely a fish dinner,
and the gratitude of the ancient dame, for what she is about to
receive, are delightful. You can scent the broth, which in this
instance too many cooks can't spoil; you see how the good
lady has the best sauce in the world to take with her fish,
namely that supplied by a good appetite; while, as a lotion
for her throat, what is in that inviting-looking pottle-pot? A
wee drappit o' schnaps to which she can put her lips when
so dispoged? or may be only thin beer? No matter, Madam
—here's your health, and may your appetite be soon appeased.
And what ought to be our English title for this picture? Is
it not evident?—why, of course: My Old Dutch, or Her Grace
before Dinner. Attractive too as are the Holbein, the
Correggio and the Gainsborough, 'tis this old dame, of
Fish Pie ’Ouse fervour, that has won the Baron's heart.
What charm | What a grace
Bygone Eton. The Baron resents the title. Yes. Messrs.
SporriswooDE & Co., LTD., publishers of what is certain to be
a delightful series of pictures, of which “Part I.” has just
appeared, yes, iterumque, the Baron resents the title. There
can be no “bygones” for Eton. Floreat Etonal Let “by-
gones be bygones,” and away with them! This collection
is described as one of “Permanent Photographs.” There
is some comfort in this. First tableau, “View of Eton
College in 1621.” Here are the “foundations,” and, bit
for the statue of the Royal Founder being conspicuous
by its “absence” (i.e., he did not answer to his name in
the school yard), here is the old place as it was, and
very much as it is. Then we come to 1700, when we
find that the College has rapidly
developed itself. In front there
is absolutely “the wall” (height
about four feet) where the lolly-
pop and “sock” merchants of
yore (a little later than 1700) ſº
were wont to drive a roaring ſº
trade among the sucking dukes,
marquises, lords, and very
short commons, all Eatin' boys.
The schoolyard in 1814 finishes
the set for the present. The
Baron awaits further develop-
ments.

THE TATE-A-TATE GALLERY.
It has been suggested recently in one
of the papers that the National Gallery
is becoming more a rendezvous for
engaged, or would-be engaged, couples
than a haunt of the earnest student of
the Old Masters. If this is the case—
and with the weather we have been
having it would not cause surprise—so
pressing a matter had better be regu-
larised without delay. We beg there-
fore, with all diffidence, to call the
attention of the Director, Sir Edward
Poynter, to the following more or less
needful improvements:–
As the rooms are now inconveniently
large, they should be partitioned off by
a number of screens. This would
ensure at least partial privacy, and pro-
vide “cosy corners,” of course under
due supervision, to advanced students.
Each compartment would be supplied
with easy chairs, tea table, mistletoe-
bough, and other necessaries.
Vol. Cxxvi.
º
The staff of attendants should be
adequately increased by the enrol-
ment of Stewards and Masters of Cere-
monies, well versed in Leap-Year, Covent
Garden, Smart Set, and Bank Holiday
etiquette.
#. staircases should be multiplied,
as many members of suburban dancing
clubs are accustomed to such accommo-
dation, and use no other, for sitting-out.
The lighting should be more subdued,
if possible, than at present, with the
exception, perhaps, of one fairly well-lit
chamber for beginners.
The majority of the pictures should
be turned with their faces to the wall,
or removed altogether, as they are pro-
ductive of suicidal melancholy, or, at
any rate, induce a headache and a desire
to home forthwith. They might be
replaced by the idyllic and Early-Vic-
torian love-scenes so frequently depicted
a well-known R.A., or else by a series
the most cheerful and popular post-
cards. A few of the more presentable
M
portraits, such as those of Lady HAMILTON
or the Parson's Daughter, might be re-
tained, unless it is considered that they
would lead to invidious comparisons, in
appearance and behaviour, with young
ladies of the present day.
To ensure the strictest propriety,
admission should be by Season Ticket in
the case of those whose addresses can
be traced in the Court Directories, and
by Ticket-of-Leave in the case of others.
Such tickets to be revocable by the
Deportment Department of the London
County Council.
Only students and visitors between
the ages of seventeen and fifty-in-the-
shade should be allowed to enter, and
no devotee of art permitted to encumber
the rooms with easels and such-like
painting apparatus.
Lastly, the Institution should be re-
named the “Tate-à-Tate Gallery,” a
similarly-named building at Millbank
being available for life-study on identi-
cal lines. -

CEDANT ARMA TOGAE ºf
[The Berlin Correspondent of the Express mentions a Ministerial
decree which “states that soldiers who hesitate to kill or wound
offending civilians are unworthy to wear their uniforms, and render
themselves liable to imprisonment. . . . Though the issue of this
decree indicates no new departure, it is intended to emphasise the
fundamental idea in German militarism that military men are a class
of society far superior to civilians.” The following lines are respect-
fully placed in the lips of the German Minister of War.]
PRIDE of the Fatherland Superb police,
Whose business is to keep in constant fettle,
Be it not said the rust of armed peace
Has paralysed your military mettle;
Prove that a courage equal to the best
Still agitates the Teuton's mailed chest.
You cannot always wallow in a sea
Of Gallic gore, or bulge with heathen booty;
The Watch upon the Rhine or else the Spree
Entails a homely round of bloodless duty;
But, while the counter-jumper walks the streets,
Scope should be surely found for martial feats.
There is a vicious habit, so we hear,
Which Army men are very rightly shocked at,
Of showing disregard for warlike gear—
The Captain's corset and the General's cocked-hat;
Men do not drop their dazzled eyes and faint
Before the warrior in his awful paint.
Yet, as the Brahman has his holy cow,
Or the primeval Hottentot his totem,
Two things there are to which we Germans bow
(Almost too widely known for me to quote 'em),
Two Faiths, our final stay in stress and storm—
The KAISER and the KAISER's uniform.
And shall a man of mere commercial breed,
Lacking the elements of true gentility,
Pass in his homespun cloth or Harris tweed
Unchallenged 'twixt the wind and your nobility?
Not while vou wear a sabre at vour side
With which to perforate his p i. hide
Should such an one (to take a common case),
Emboldened by excessive bouts of Munich
In some beer-garden which you deign to grace,
Brush disrespectfully against your tunic,
Or soil your Blüchers with civilian mud–
Out with your instant blade and have his blood
Unter den Lindem, when the sun is low,
And, in a leisure hour exempt from drilling,
With rigid gait and clanking spurs you go,
A dream of godlike beauty, simply killing,
If any knave dispute the path you tread,
Your falchion should at once remove his head.
Noblesse, of course, oblige. You mustn't trail
Your sabre-tache for vulgar churls to step on,
But seize occasion and you cannot fail
To find the man you want to flesh your weapon;
Should he (unarmed, for choice) provoke the strife,
Why, then your course is clear; you take his life!
Let not a low civilian wipe the eye
Of but “a single Pomeranian Grenadier”;
Rather let Art, with Laws and Learning, die—
Pursuits to which the meaner types of men adhere;
I'd sooner even dislocate our Trade
Than let the Army's honour be mislaid.
That honour it is yours to guard unstained,
Burnished as though by frequent use of emery,
Keeping our glorious record well maintained,
Just as our mighty Lord of blessed memory,
The ne'er-to-be-forgotten WILLIAM ONE,
Would, were he living, like to see it done. 0. S.
REED'S ENTIRE.
This show, at Messrs. BRowN AND PHILLIPs' Leicester
Galleries, must not be missed by anyone who loves
genuine, good-natured, genial caricature. No cruelty in
the mixture. Even if you happen to be one of the
caricatured, say Mr. CHAMBERLAN, Lord RosebERY, or Sir
WILLIAM HARCOURT, you couldn't be angry; you’d be bound
to laugh and exclaim “how absurd ' " Among the many
comic presentments of “Joe,” who may be looked upon as
the universal provider of matter for political caricaturists,
there is one here that at first sight might be a quizzical
portrait of GEORGE GROSSMITH giving one of his humorous
sketches, vocal and instrumental. No. 30, “The Jackdaw of
Louth,” Mr. TIM HEALY, M.P., is perfect as a specimen of
Mr. REED's black and white art. Another, “selected ” as
specially good and wonderfully delicate in tone, is No. 36,
“The Tariff Spider at work in his Web.” Very far removed
from caricature, but on the contrary a delightful portrait, is
that of His Majesty King Edward THE SEVENTH, as we all love
to see him, in excellent health and spirits, “starting the
Marionettes,” that is, opening Parliament and setting the
figures a-moving. This No., 63, is a very remarkable and
effective piece of work. 85—“when found make a note of "-
“Rosebery Bunsby.” “Whereby, why not ? If so, what
odds? Can any man say otherwise? No. Awast then
The bearings of this observation lays in the application on
it. Awast then, keep a bright look-out for’ard, and good
luck to you!”
The best of the “Unrecorded History Series” is, to our
thinking, No. 110, suggested by “Holbern's attempt to swim
the Channel.” Mr. REED might give us a recently discovered
Assyrian tablet showing the most ancient Parliamentary
proceedings of the Hittouts (in Opposition) and the Sittites
(the Government). But where there are so many excellent
things every purchaser may feel assured that he individually
has got the pick of the basket. A great number we see are
already marked “Sold,” and many intending buyers, arriving
too late, will be in the position of those pictures (and be
hanged to them!) when they only meet with the polite
custodian's explanation, “All gone, Sir.” No matter, there's
more where those came from, let us hope, for many years to
conne.
There’s many a true jest spoken in earnest.
WE are indebted to the Indian Planters' Gazette for calling
public attention to the following passage from the Advocate
of India, in which a comparison is drawn between German
and English methods of commercial training:-
“The budding principal is drafted into an office through Oxford,
where he has distinguished himself in the dead languages and won his
spurs and his stiff knee in the eight who contest the annual football
match at Lord's, or his blazer and straw hat in the fifteen who pulled
off the cricket match between Mortlake and Putney.”
“OUIDA" must look to her laurels.
FRENCHADAPTATION.—Honour to Mr. BARRIE. The authorities
of the Français have under serious consideration an adap-
tation of Mr. BARRIE’s now celebrated play. The scene is on
board a Channel steamer. Le Mal de Mer y est has been
suggested for the title.

It is Good of you to suggest
LIFE'S LITTLE EMBARRASS-
MENTS.
(By the Expert Wrinkler.)
THE true test of greatness, as I have
always held, is a man's ability to rise to
the occasion, be it great or small. Your
true man of the world will never be
floored by an emergency, though, as I
have often found myself, it may put
him to serious inconvenience. For
example, the first time I went to pay a
visit to a ducal mansion, I found, on
going up to dress for dinner, that my
man had omitted to put up an evening
waistcoat. I confess that I had what
our festive friends across the Channel
call “a bad quarter of an hour” before
I saw my way out of the difficulty.
Ringing the bell I took the footman into
my confidence, and in ten minutes he
had procured for me a cast-off waistcoat
of the Duke's, which I bought off him
—the footman, not the Duke—for a
sovereign, and still keep amongst the
most valued treasures of my wardrobe.
-
I need hardly say that on my return I
ve my man such a talking to as he
id not forget for years. An oversight
of this sort is a regular crime, and it is
folly to overlook it. My friend, Lord
EUGENE SANDown, who was a very
powerful man with a violent temper,
whenever his man forgot anything in
this way, used to throw it at him as a
reminder. The man stood it for a while,
but gave warning after being hit on the
nose by a boot-tree. I am afraid, from
what I hear on every side, that the
loyalty of domestic servants is not a
patch on what it used to be.
TABLE EMBARRASSMENTS.
One of the most fertile sources of
embarrassment is to be offered a dish
with the composition of which you are
not familiar, or which you don't know
exactly how to manipulate. I shall
never forget the awful experience I
went through years ago at a very stylish
dinner, when *...i to eat the sort of
paper box in which portions of salmon
were served. On another occasion,
in a fit of absent-mindedness, I put
a large spoonful of ice pudding into my
mouth, thinking it was hot. Over the
sequel I draw a veil. We all of us have
done foolish things in the past, and I
only allude to the episode in order that
it may serve as a danger signal to my
readers. It is consoling, however, to
know that persons of high rank and
noble birth do not escape these un-
pleasantnesses. For instance, there was
a foreign Count, I think he came from
Circassia or some such place, who was
invited to stay at Lord HIGHCLERE's, and
when they brought him hot water in the
morning, not knowing what to do with
it, he drank it! Shrimps, again, are a
severe trial to men of refined natures.
And many men are often seriously em-
barrassed by being given tea or coffee
too hot to be swallowed with impunity.
In such a case at all hazards resist the
temptation to blow on the boiling
beverage or empty it into your saucer.
Some men in these circumstances

extricate themselves by indulging in
facetiousness, e.g., saying to their
hostess, “I’m afraid I'll have to trouble
ou for some more cow-juice,” or, “Look
ou seem to think that I’m like
ere,
Lord TEIGNMoUTH, who can swallow any-
thing.” On the whole. I think it is
better form to wait until the fluid has
cooled of itself. Some people, however,
carry about with them little refrigerating
tabloids, which will reduce the hottest
tea to an endurable temperature. In
this connection let me give my readers a
piece of advice. If by any ill chance
you should drop an oyster or a poached
egg on the cloth or the floor, do not
attempt to pick it up yourself, but allow
the hunt to be conducted by one of the
domestics. One generally makes bad
worse in the attempt, besides calling
attention to one's misfortune.
MISCELLANEOUS AGONIES.
There is perhaps nothing so painful
for a smart man as to É. himself
unsuitably clad. I shall never forget
once seeing at the Oxford and Cambridge
match a tall man with a pointed beard,
wearing a low evening waistcoat and a
black-bow tie. He j not seem in the
least conscious of his position, and I
found out afterwards that he was a
Russian Grand Duke. That no doubt
enabled him to carry it off. For myself,
one of the few experiences in my career
that I should like to obliterate was that
of finding myself in Piccadilly wearing a
frock-coat and a straw hat. It was a warm
morning in May, and without thinking
what I was doing I put on a straw hat
and walked out from my chambers in
the Albany in the direction of the Park.
Most providentially I had not got as far
as Devonshire House when my old friend
the Hon. PERCY MARTINGALE met me, and,
leading me up Berkeley Street, explained
what had happened. I concealed myself
in the passage leading to Curzon Street
until he called a fourwheeler, and went
home with the blinds down. My onl
excuse was that I had had a sharp ãº.
of the “flu,” which occasionally affects
the memory. Fortunately I was able
not very long afterwards to repay the
Hon. PERCY TINGALE for his kind
service in a somewhat similar way.
Meeting him in the Park, I noticed that
he had omitted to remove the label from
his new Chesterfield, which bore the
inscription, “Sale Price, £2 12s. 6d.” I
feel pretty sure that if his father, Lord
PUNCHESTown, had seen it, he would have
cut him off with a shilling.

CHARIVARIA.
THE War between Russia and Japan
is taking place under the most dis-
tinguished patronage. We learn from
the newspapers that our own little
Princes, and the CzAR, have purchased
maps, and pins with flags, and are
following the course of events with the
greatest interest. .
It was reported one day last week that
the Koreans, “as the result of a col-
lision” at Kangsye, had driven the
Russians back beyond the Yalu. Those
who know the Koreans will agree that
it could only have been the result of an
accident.
Last week's Dispatch contained “A
Baronet's Jokes.” We are pleased to
find Baronets making jokes. It raises
our profession.
Some surprise was expressed at the
arrival of some warm sunny days last
week, but surely one would expect a
Leap Year to have a certain amount of
Spring in it.
Last week it was stated that the
signal-book of H.M.S. Prince George had
been thrown overboard by some evil-
disposed person, but public anxiety was
somewhat relieved by the announcement
that, like all signal-books, it was so
weighted that it would sink, and still
further relieved by the news that it had
been found floating in the Tagus.
It is so difficult nowadays to be a
ntleman that one feels really grateful
to the Daily Mirror for publishing a
communiqué on the subject of handker-
chiefs. A representative of that organ
was fortunate enough to get a glimpse
of the KING's Royal Handkerchief at the
Shire Horse Show, and in future all but
rank outsiders will use a small cambric
handkerchief with a deep red border in
the morning, and a plain white one in
the afternoon and evening. This applies
both to country and town.
Meanwhile, among the lower orders
the colour most affected would still
appear to be dark white.
The War is already developing a
“light side.” . The “Jolly Japs” have
had a good joke at Port Arthur by
causing the Russians to waste ammu-
nition on dummy boats, and it is now
reported that General KUROPATRIN has
bought three magnificent chestnuts.

[In an article in the Fortnightly Review, Mrs. John LANE, from the
point of view of the American hostess, wonders if it is shyness that
makes the Englishman so hard to entertain.]
Chorus of American Girls.
O sons of Britannia, the thought of you lured us
To cross in Cunarders the perilous sea;
We braved the wild billows, for rumour assured us.
That nowhere were men so delightful as ye.
But when we look kind you are solemn and frigid,
You blush at the glint of a maidenly eye,
And the more we ii. you become the more rigid—
O sons of Britannia, why are you so shy?
Chorus of English Men.
Columbia's daughters, we're filled with emotion
At thought of the favours you heap upon us,
For—distance no object—you traversed the ocean
To spoil us with kindness and flattering fuss.
But we're so accustomed to manners which freeze us,
Totongues which are dumb, that we're tempted to fly
When we meet with a countenance anxious to ease us,
And that is perhaps why you find us so shy.
Chorus of American Girls.
O sons of Britannia, in vain will you harden
Your adamant hides to the snares of the foe;
We still will pursue you in ball-room and garden,
On river and race-course—wherever you go.
You've old country seats and delectable titles;
All arts known to woman we're going to ply;
We'll borrow love's arrows and aim at your vitals,
And teach you to be just a little less shy.
Chorus of English Men.
Columbia's daughters, we've British-made beauty;
Whatever the charms of American fairs,
Still England expects us to stick to our duty
And preference give to our own native wares.
In vain have you boarded the heaving Cunarder,
In vain for our castles and scutcheons you sigh;
Our country is calling; the patriot's ardour
That burns in the Briton still bids us be shy.

As to the Opera, Mr. Punch is able to announce that
Dr. RichTER is to be entrusted with the interests of Wagnerian
productions, and will direct special performances of Tann-
häuser, Tristan and Die Meistersinger without any cutting
remarks. This is kind: so we shall hear these works in
their entirety. Perhaps the Doctor's prescription will be a
trifle too strong even for some Wagnerians.
Ballo en Maschera is to be revived, and this will interest
not a few ancient habitués who, clearly remembering MARio
in the chief rôle, can only look upon his successors as, by
comparison, mere Mario-nettes.
Dr. Richter, Signor MANCINELLI the Merry, and Herr Löhse,
will be the conductors to ward off the stroke of the critics'
lightning. The strings in the orchestra are to be strengthened
with chords, and it is hoped that the grande caisse in front
of the house will be considerably benefited by all the new
arrangements. On the opening night it is expected that the
best known habitués and strenuous supporters of the Opera
will bow from their stalls and private boxes. The National
Anthem, arranged as a trio (with chorus), will be sung b
Lord DE GREY, Mr. HIGGINs, and Lord Esher. The forces wi
be under the supervision of General Manager MessageR; while
Mr. NEIL Forsyth will be again at the post whereon he will
be perched throughout i. season to which Mr. Punch

THE BUMBLE-BEE-BOY.
This is a tale that was told to me
Of a boy who was born a Bumble-Bee.
He never required to wet his throttle
With a drink of milk from a feeding-bottle;
They never brought him pap in a ladle;
He never was rocked in a ribboned cradle;
Nobody saw him gasp or struggle,
Or box with his fists or crow or guggle;
And none of his mother's friends said “There !
Did you ever? I never. I do declare
You needn't be born with a taste for photos
To see that the child, from his tootsie-totos
To his sweet little damp little lips of coral,
Is—look at the pet—his Ma's own moral.
But his nose, when it's formed, I think will rather
Remind us all of his blessed father;
While, as for his eyes which are blue as blue,
They're the child's own eyes and his ears are, too.”
And never a nurse, as far as I know,
Said, “Bless him, he isn't one to pine, no,
Not he: it's a week since I weighed him last,
But he's done so well, and he's growed so fast,
That, law, you might a'most call him bloated,
And next week, sure, he must be short-coated.”
He never sat in his chair and bubbled,
And his dear little temper was never troubled
With dust in his eyes or a safety pin
Stuck by mistake in his tender skin;
And as to his teeth—you know that pest
Which robs us of all our lawful rest—
I’m game to wager a brand-new penny
That he didn't fret, for he hadn't any.
They never took him and washed his head
Or his body and legs with soap or borax;
A window-pane was his simple bed,
And he hadn't a neck, but he had a thorax.
And, oh, he was jolly and fat and round—
You never saw such a fat round fellow—
With wings that buzzed with a booming sound,
And a body of black with a dash of yellow.
Whenever he wished to, out he flew
As fast as a car with a X horse-power,
And skimmed the bushes and drank the dew,
As he flitted and perched from flower to flower.
And when he was tired he flew again
Back to his bed on the window-pane.
He was never worried with A.B.C.,
He was never troubled with one two three,
But he did what he jolly well liked, as free
As a Bumble-Bee-Boy is bound to be.
The Bar Point-to-Point Steeplechase is fixed for April 12.
Several difficult Legal Points are now being raised. To
certain propositions, that have been made to the Committee,
the riders strongly object.

IN sudden cases of shock, such as

further paternal parent to cradle to scream at

robe, with paternal great-aunt or mater-
nal bachelor friend, it has been found
efficacious to contract the arms and legs,
stiffen the spine, contort the features,
open the mouth and hold the breath

immediate and occasionally violent re-
moval of the apparition is ensured by
these simple tactics, and rapid return to
the nursery guaranteed.
The habit of screaming at a hovering
teaspoonful of dill-water cannot be too
strongly deprecated. The open throat
plays into the unscrupulous hands of the
operator and defeats its own ends. The
mouth may be left open after the last
protest, but the throat should be closed,
in order to allow the noxious fluid,
augmented with tears and dribbling,
to run out of the corners of the lips and
escape down the neck unperceived. In
the case of the nose being held, the only
remedy is to choke to suffocation, there-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 7.
—The MEMBER FOR SARK has vivid
recollection, dating back to early man-
hood, of sitting enthralled through a
play called A Scrap of Paper. As far
as he remembers there was a sort of
family cabinet council. Someone wrote
a dubious document round whose sus-
pected existence mystery brooded. At
last Mr. KENDAL found it rolled up as a
spill in an ornament on the chimney-
piece, and there was the doose to pay.
As Jaques (not the Emperor of the
SAHARA) once said, “All the world's a
stage, and all the men and women
merely players.” To-night, by special
desire, A Scrap of Paper was staged
at the T.R., Westminster. Boxes full;
pit crowded; fºllº; thronged; stand-
ing room only. ... Enter John ELLIS ;
wants to know all about the Scrap of
Paper.
Story of play runs something like
this: At Cabinet Council held in August
the PREMIER, alleged villain of the piece,
went down to Downing Street with two
documents in his possession, one reposin
in léft coat-tail pocket, the other j
of in the right. One, the bulkier,
declaring against Protection to the
length advocated by the Second Willain
(DoN José), was, as in the course of the
play the First Villain airily remarks,

especially the gallery portion, always

He hit out all round, not forgetting late
colleagues below the gangway. But
ever he came back to the blameless C.-B.
Talking about speculations current at
period when the Scrap of Paper first
fluttered in Downing Street, speculations
culminating in assurance of break-up of
the Ministry, he observed, “Every kind
of suggested combination reached my
ears. Though by the way I do not
remember that the name of the right

A hit, a palpable hit. House roared
in delighted mirth. JoHN ELLIS moved
uneasily at his grindstone. This most
irregular. . PRINCE ARTHUR was, so to
speak, in the dock. Technically he was
there; but instead of whimpering for
mercy, promising repentance, or even
endeavouring to explain away com-
promising matters, here he was banging
the jury on the head, butting the judge
in the stomach, utterly ignoring the
authority, and even the presence of the
tipstaff, selecting the most blameless,
supremely respectable looking gentleman
among the audience, and fixing upon
him whatever guilt might attach to the
Scrap of Paper, whatever obloquy re-
sulted from its manipulation.

quietly enjoying himself under summer
skies, “leaving the anguish to us.”
Business done.—Adjournment moved
by way of indicting PREMIER for conduct
in connection with throwing overboard

only sixty-five in defence of PREMIER
under charge he himself described as
that of “jockeying his colleagues.”
Wednesday night.—Mr.WHARTON, P.C.,
Director of North Eastern Railway,
Knight of Grace and of St. John of
Jerusalem, is thinking of retiring from
the business of statesmanship. To-day
perceived great opportunity; seized
it by the hair, as they say at Boulogne.
Opposition, eager to make most of
Ministerial difficulties, had put up PIRIE
with motion deprecating language used
by certain of His Majesty's Ministers
advocating Preferential and Protective
Tariffs. This designed less with view
of declaring vote on Opposition benches
than with hope of catching Free Fooders
in Ministerial camp. At best they could
not vote against the motion, and Minis-
ters would have another bad majority.
Then WHARTON rose to full height,
which exceeds six feet. Determined to
save the Government. Characteristic
of a statesman who combines railway
directorship with Knighthood of Grace,
WHARTON bent upon compromise. If he
could frame amendment to PIRIE’s motion
so drafted as to provide a golden brid
over which Unionist Free Fooders might
march into Lobby with their leaders,
surely they would gratefully accept it.
Took off his coat; sat down; bound
his knightly head in spotless linen cooled
in New River water; seized a Knight of
Jerusalem's quill pen; in half an hour
produced his masterpiece. Amendment
declared approval of “the explicit
declaration of His Majesty's Ministers
that their policy of fiscal reform includes
neither a general system of Protection
nor of Preference based on the taxation
of food.”
“That'll fetch 'em,” said the Knight
of Grace, wiping his Jerusalem pen on
the lining of his West-end frock coat.
Showed it to ACLAND-HooD.
“Capital,” said Ministerial Whip.
“The verything,” said PRINCE ARTHUR
when it was submitted to him.
When amendment appeared on Paper
painful discovery obtruded itself. As
on historic occasion GRANDOLPH “forgot
GoschEN,” so now the Knight of Peace
had forgotten the Chamberlainites
within the Ministerial fold. These
met, a hundred strong. Recognised in
amendment distinct, deliberate, public,
irrevocable chucking-over of Don José.
Sent ultimatum to hapless PRINCE ARTHUR.
If amendment persisted in they would
vote with Opposition; whereupon it was
the Government, not Don José, who
would be chucked.
Nothing to be done but wipe out
WHARTON and his amendment. To-night,
when motion moved and seconded, open-
ing made for amendment, Opposition
jubilantly shouted “WHARTON! WHAR-

But WHARTON was not.

CRICKET REFORM.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. Gilbert
Jessop.)
Now that the Test Matches are over
and attention can be paid to cricket at
home, I should like to bring forward
a few points which have been omitted
from my contributions to the Daily
Mail, but upon which I feel very deeply:
they are all, I need hardly say, put forth
in the interest of cricket as a noble
spectacle.
Should RAIN BE ALLOWED2
The recent Test Matches are in
themselves sufficient proof of the mis-
chief and havoc that can be wrought
in the king of games by a steady down-
pour. What the M.C.C. Committee
ought to do before anything else, is to
endeavour to come to some decision
with regard to rain. -
Tenders for rain-stopping should be
invited from all the leading scientists,
such as MAxiM, Edison, MARCONI and
H. G. Wells. Unless something is done
cricket might as well be discontinued.
Over and over again the best batsmen
are dismissed for a round 0 or a mere
handful of runs, owing to the disastrous
effect of rain on the pitch. All wickets
should be plumb. In the event of the
experiments of the scientists failing,
every county ground should be supplied
with an umbrella large enough to cover
the whole pitch, without interfering
with the view of either spectators or
reporters. The umbrella's stick is the only
difficulty; but I have no doubt that
some device could be hit upon by which
the canopy could be held up. It might
be suspended from a captive balloon.
SHOULD POPULAR BATSMEN BE GIVEN OUT 2
Here we touch upon delicate ground.
But the fact remains that, under the
prevailing conditions, Englishmen who
have paid their money to see certain
batsmen perform are too often compelled
to leave the ground baffled of their
desire. That so many worthy persons
should be disappointed is surely a state of
things not contemplated by the original
compilers of the laws of the game. The
circumstance that cricket exists to amuse
spectators makes it of the highest import-
ance that a favourite performer should
have a full innings every time. To this
end I pro to deliver a series of
lectures to º: and fielders on the
principles of altruism, showing them
how the lowest, even a long-stop, may
contribute his mite towards the prolonga-
tion of a batsman's life when the happi-
ness of the greatest number demands it.
TUBEs IMPERATIVE for BATSMEN who MAKE
DUCKs.
Probably no sight is more cheerless to
This Is NEITHER THE Russian Non THE JAPANESE FLEET DURING A story; it is MERELY'A
view of our NEIGHBOURs' Roofs AND CHIMNEY STACKS THROUGH THE BAD PANE of GLAss PUT IN

the spectators of cricket, and certainly
few experiences are more depressing to
the batsman, than the return to the
pavilion after failure to score.
In the foregoing paragraph I have
given my reasons for holding that blobs
or even short innings should be made
impossible; but in default of that I am
persuaded that in as far as possible
mortification should be spared. To this
end I wish to revive an old project of
the present Colonial Secretary for an
underground passage from the wicket to
the dressing-rooms. To make this pas-
sage would be a very simple business.
The entry would be gained by an
ordinary man-hole Just behind the
stumps at the pavilion end, and it would
need to be kept carefully closed until
wanted, in case the wicket-keeper fell in
at a critical moment.
The other end would be somewhere
well within the pavilion walls, to obviate
that most painful part of the whole
débâcle, the ascent of the pavilion steps.
The tube would be lighted by electricity,
and there might perhaps be a writing
recess in it, furnished with ink, pens
and paper, in which the batsman could
record for the morrow's paper his im-
pressions of the fatal ball while they
were still warm and vivid.
THE NEED of GREATER FACILITIES FOR
CRICKETING-WRITERs.
That very necessary person the
cricketer-writer is confronted every day
by new obstacles, which I feel it my
duty to attempt to remove. For example,
suppose that CHARLES FRY has under-
taken to forward a column descriptive of
his innings, ball by ball, to the Daily
Half-Volley, and he is in for four hours.
It stands to reason that if he does not
begin his record until he is out he is in
danger of losing sight of the character
of some of the early balls: his perceptions
will be blunted; he will forget whether
he snicked this for three or cut that
for two; and his readers—the great
generous reading public for whom we
all toil—will be disappointed, if not
positively, defrauded. What I suggest
therefore is that a five minutes' interval
be taken every quarter of an hour during
the day, in which all cricketers who
have journalistic engagements may jot
down their impressions. Few on the
field would be idle. I would suggest
that note books and telegraph forms be
compulsorily carried by the umpires—
several for every man, in case a literary
impulse overtook him. Only in this
way can cricket be properly written
about; and without writing the game
falls to the ground.

MoN CHER ABDUL, — Enchanté de
recevoir votre lettre. Vous êtes si
aimable, mon cher ami. Quelle triste
chose que la vie ! Chacun est rasta, ou
snob, ou voyou, et il n'a qu'une idée,
celle de vous dévaliser. C'est effroyable
pour un homme aussi pauvre que moi.
Les affaires ne marchent pas du tout.
Il y a si peu de caoutchouc, savez-vous,
et il y a tant d'imbéciles qui s'occupent
de cette petite industrie congolaise, et
s'écrient contre ce qu'ils appellent
" l'esclavage." En Belgique il y a des
imbéciles qui détestent le jeu. Par
conséquent mon petit terrain à Ostende
ne rapporte rien. Les entreprises belges
en Russie sont en baisse, ou en liquida-
tion. Rien me va plus. Et par dessus
le marché on intente un procès contre
moi à Bruxelles même.
Je voudrais bien me refugier quelque
part. Je deviendrais Roi de Macédoine
très volontiers, savez-vous, mais le pays
n'est pas assez tranquille. Je serais
écrasé, comme le fruit dans une macé-
doine. Tout ce que je désire c'est la

marchent si mal. Moi je n'ai pas le sou.
Et cependant je tâche de faire quelques
petites économies. J'ai une bonne idée.
J'attendrai encore quelques mois, et puis
j'acheterai tout ce qui reste de la flotte
russe. C'est une chose qui me manque.
Si vous n'avez pas cinquante mille

FRoM a local Bedford paper we learn
that " Professor PHINEAs J. MUBBs, of the

motoring is a cure for crime. .. .. It is
suggested that each resident of Dart-
moor Prison or Holloway shallbe allowed
to take a daily spin on a 50-h.p. car. It
is certain that if this , plan prevailed
many confirmed criminals would not be

agrees as to the practical certainty of
their disappearance.

THE GOLDEN MEAN.
[Mrs. EARLE has again been airing her views on diet in the National
Review.]
In my Surrey retreat I have found it most sweet to devote
my seclusion and quiet
To devise the best course to grow strong as a horse by a
diligent study of diet,
And as so much depends for oneself and one's friends on the
kind of the food that one swallows
It has seemed to me best that the world be possessed of the
little résumé which follows:
Don't be tempted to eat of the poison called meat, but eschew
such insidious dishes;
If you're wise you will scowl at the whole genus fowl, and
avoid all descriptions of fishes;
Tea must never be had; coffee's equally bad; cocoa's worse,
for its action is quicker,
And of course I taboo any venomous brew which is known as
intoxicant liquor. - -
Deadly danger I see in the pulse and the pea, and I cannot
be over-emphatic
In condemning most fruits and the tuberous roots, while
asparagus makes one rheumatic;
Few and simple, say I, are the things which supply all our
bodily wants and our mental, *
For we need nothing but a banana or nut, or an apple, an
orange or lentil. s
Then, as well as the kind, it's important, I find, to consider
how much should be eaten:
To avoid all excess is the rule I profess, and it's one that can
never be beaten.
Do not gorge till you're ill on the nuts of Brazil; though the
lentils be ne'er so delightful,
Don't continue to eat when you once are replete, but abstain
ere you feel yourself quite full. -
But while greed should be stopped don't be moved to adopt
the uncheerful ascetic demeanour;
I detest the poor soul who just toys with a roll and who daily
grows leaner and leaner;
Eat vour nuts with dº. and a sound appetite—I've a
iſ: for those who can grapple
With an extra Brazil or devour with a will a banana on top
of their apple.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THERE is a pleasant flavour of good old-fashioned melo-
drama about Mr. MURRAY's latest novel, V.C. (CHATTo AND
WINDUs). Nine out of ten writers, having the story to tell, would
have found situation and local colour in the war in South
Africa. Mr. MURRAY goes back fifty years to the time of the
Crimean War, episodes of which }. introduces in vivid
passages. The period thus remote, the stage is appropriately
trodden by the dishonest father; the gallant General, who,
having retired on a competency, is ruined by trusting the
villain; the proud impeccable son of the wicked father, who
loves the daughter of the ruined General and breaks away
from his home to take the Queen's shilling. It is an old old
story, in some of its particulars dating as far back as the
Newcomes. Mr. MURRAY tells it briskly, and no one taking
up the volume will be inclined to put it down till he reaches
the not-too-distant end. My Baronite finds the master touch
in the incident of the repudiated swindling father going out
to the Crimea and tenderly watching over the sick bed of
the wounded son who had renounced him.
In David March (METHUEN) Mr. FLETCHER shows trace of
the influence of Sir WALTER Scott, which my Baronite finds
refreshing after a long meal of novels of the day. He goes
back to the Stuart period, and skilfully fills his canvas with
characters that might well have peopled Cheapside at the
time, or dwelt in the leafy streets of country towns. Un-
fettered by modern conventionalities his men and women
walk with free and easy stride. The hero, a foundlin
apprenticed to a village blacksmith, comes across the j
daughter of a neighbouring squire. Straightway he falls in
love with her, which was not surprising even “somewhere
about the end of the month of May in the year 1683,” as the
date is alluringly fixed. Where the marvel comes in is that
Cynthia Gervase, with equal suddenness and completeness,
falls in love with the grimy blacksmith, sticks to him through
thick and thin, marries, and lives happily ever after.
Historical characters, King CHARLEs, Judge JEFFREYs, and
CHRISTOPHER WREN among them, flit through pages aglow
with life and colour.
A Maid of Mystery, by L. T. MEADE (F. W. WHITE & Co.),
is a sensational romance that the Baron has no hesitation in
recommending to the attention of all those who, seeking
distraction from the cares and troubles of this extra-ordinary
mortal life, find their haven of rest in perusing an absorbing
sensational romance, as they sit in an old arm-chair cosily
placed in a warm corner. So far in praise of this story
in a general way, but the Baron, as he must needs be critical,
is compelled to admit that as to the originality of the idea he
has his doubts, unless of course the author has never read or
heard of Pauline, by ALEXANDRE DUMAs, one of the best
romances ever written, to which this present work bears a
certain very evident resemblance. Again, the Baron, unwill-
ing to interfere with the pleasure of those who have not yet
read the book, but representing the curiosity of those who
have, would like to be informed, First, who was Ishmael?
Secondly, who attempted the crime which, had it succeeded,
would apparently have been a blunder? Thirdly, what was
the secret of which Nurse Elton was all along in possession,
which she promised to reveal at the right moment, which
she was implored by the heroine to discover to her, but
which Nurse Elton kept so strictly to herself that even the
author may have merely a suspicion of its character? The
title would have been more to the point if, instead of The Maid
of Mystery, it had been called The Nurse-maid of Mystery.
Cherry's Child (F. W. WHITE), by John STRANGE WINTER, is
a puzzling story, that is, to a mere man. By the superior
sex in petticoats it will be appreciated at its full value.
Putting aside Bootle's Baby, as one separates Pickwick
from all DICKENs's other works, this is, in the Baron's opinion,
the best of Mrs. STANNARD's many novels. It is difficult
to understand the heroine or the two heroes, which terms
are merely conventional as indicating the principal characters
of this story. And for this very
reason, therefore, it is life-like,
and, being so, the wayward con-
duct of the trio is, though interest-
ing, most irritating. Of dramatic
situations there are none: but the
dialogue is that of epigrammatic ſº
comedy, except when it necessa- ſº
rilydrops intothemerelyordinary.
It will interest the “spindle-side,”
but the “spear-side” will probably
be disappointed. Thestory isspun
out, and the material becomes
rather thin in the process.

clean sweep.”

SMUTS ON THE SITUATION:
OR, The “DEVIL's Advocate.”
[“There burns in the Boer mind a fierce indignation against this
sacrilege of Chinese importation—this spoliation of the heritage for
which the generations of the people have sacrificed their all.”—Published
letter of Advocate J. C. SMUts, of Pretoria. N.B.-Since Chinese
labour is only destined for the mines, a field of energy which has never
attracted the Boer himself, it would seem that Mr. Smuts in the above
passage is * advocating the cause of the Kaffir as against that of
the Oriental. There must be a mistake somewhere.]
A BREAST with brazen corset trebly fitted,
And a superb capacity of jaw,
Needs must he have who lets himself be pitted
Against a Dutch Interpreter of Law;
But he should be one stolid mass of gristle,
Tough as Brazil's impenetrable nuts,
Who dares to cope with your expert epistle,
Advocate SMUts'
You view, I see, with undisguised aversion,
Bred of the faith that fires a patriot's blood,
Your precious country's probable immersion
Beneath a putrid stream of Pagan mud;
You see her heritage—the obvious fruit of
Your sires' sublime contempt for worldly ease—
Wrung from its rightful lords, and made the loot of
Heathen Chinees'
But what (inform me) was the actual juncture
At which your parents ceased to plough the land,
And lent their estimable thews to puncture
The hollow shafts that permeate the Rand?
I always thought they entertained a rooted
Distrust of dirty lucre's devious tracks,
And found their exploration better suited
To sinful blacks'
Misled by some Uitlandish ANANIAs,
I fancied you abhorred that hellish toil,
Content, by processes that passed for pious,
To pocket, indirectly, haſ the spoil;
While he, the godless nigger (so I gathered)
Sought to elude, inside those pits of sin,
Your Christian sjambok which would else have lathered
His sable skin.
Now lifted up with bellicose elation, -
Puffed out with perquisites, and blown with beans,
He looks on labour as an occupation
Unfitted to a gentleman of means;
Posed loosely, in a careless state of coma,
Upon his torpid back or turgid tum,
He lies enveloped by a rich aroma
Of plug and rum!
Sir, on the soil that drank our tears and treasure,
That Promised Land, our Paradise of Earth,
Are we to wait upon his Highness' pleasure—
Wait till the brute resumes his ancient girth 2
Can it be he, I ask, and not another,
Whose stolen heritage your bosom stirs?
Is it, in fact, to him as man and brother
Your note refers?
Do you protest against imported labour,
And mention sacrifices made in vain,
Simply because you hope your Kaffir neighbour
Will, by-and-by, consent to work again?
I may not plumb these deep forensic levels,
But all my native commonsense rebuts
The bare idea that you're that lazy devil's
Advocate, SMUts! O. S.
LITTLE ARTICLES BY GREAT MEN.
JAPAN's NAVAL PLANs.
(After Rear-Admiral INGL-s, Expert to the “Daily Telegraph.”)
THE immortal spirit which inspired our old-time Admirals
has passed into the minds of the Japanese naval officers.
The names of BLAKE and RodNEY are as familiar and as dear
to them as their own naval heroes HuixoMoNo and MATsUMAI.
Can I ever forget how a little Jap, torpedo-destroyer
once sprinted out of Nagasaki and hailed me through the
megaphone. The words seemed at once familiar and
unfamiliar—“DRAKE ewor a devil man.” For a moment I was
puzzled, till at last it flashed upon me that to greet an
English friend the Japanese officer was quoting NEwbolt's
immortal poem “DRAKE he was a Devon man.” Courtesy
and devotion—those two words sum up the Japanese Navy.
I recall with mingled feelings of grief and pride the
conduct of a Japanese sub-lieutenant whom I entrusted to
superintend the coaling of my ship. I said, “Keep the ship
clean—as little dust as possible.” He threw a wreath of iris
flowers on my head, and placed his hand on his heart.
Judge my surprise the next day when on returning to the
ship I found the coaling operations only just begun. On
going to watch the coolies at work I found that they were
taking the coal aboard in parcels made of rice paper. I
called the sub-lieutenant to me and hinted that though this
was cleanly it was unbusinesslike. He bowed low before my
reproof and returned to superintend the coaling. When it
was completed Ireceived a little note, “Miserable servant has
spilt abominable coal-dust on honourable decks, and there-
fore has committed hara kairi in stately top coal bunker.”
Alas, it was only too true.
To show the spirit of the ordinary sailors I may relate a
little incident. Once upon my birthday we were anchored
off Hakodate, and in honour of the occasion I asked all hands
to splice the main-brace in sakê. As I sat in my cabin I
could hear the clatter of the chop-sticks in the lacquer bowls,
and it warmed my heart to think that the men were happy.
When I went on deck an hour later I was surprised to see
carved images of myself in all parts of the ship. They had
sent off a shore-boat for a cargo of turnips, and º, the
artistic ingenuity which every Jap possesses had whittled
them into admirable busts of their loved commander. My
side whiskers were realistically represented by rope yarn.
Two of these artistic trophies, preserved in pickle, now
decorate my drawing-room.
Nor were the women backward in welcoming their English
friends. One night at a tea-house six of the most renowned
Geishas in Japan entertained us. The dance was a novel
one to me, and it was some time before I understood that it
represented the manoeuvres of a fleet, and that the most
beautiful Geisha who stood fan-waving in the centre was
supposed to be my humble self. On emerging from the tea-
house I went to seek the boots which, in accordance with
Japanese usage, I had left at the threshold. Imagine my
delight when †† that the laces had been removed, and
that in each lace-hole had been placed a different coloured
chrysanthemum. It was with proud yet awkward steps that
I made my way to the jinrikisha in waiting.
Flogging is unknown in the Japanese Navy. Small
offences I used to punish by making the offender carry a fan
of English pattern. For mutiny and murder I generally
sentenced the criminal to wear a top-hat when on duty.
This saved me the trouble of passing death-sentences, for the
criminals invariably disembowelled themselves rather than
offend their fine aesthetic sense.
I have no knowledge of the Japanese naval plans, but I
know the indomitable spirit of their officers and men. I
should not be surprised to find the Japanese fleet appearing
at Mukden. Nothing is impossible to such an heroic nation.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, March 14.—
Of all ebullitions of human ecstasy com-
mendmetothespectacle of YoungWEMYSS
addressing the House of Lords. With
some of us memory goes back to period
before he ...i to the earldom,
when, as Lord ELCHO, he sat in the
Commons and instructed us. At that
time there was, perhaps, predominant
feeling of mingled resentment and bore-
dom. During early years of House
elected in 1880 he occupied seat on
Front Bench below Gangway. This
gave him opportunity, when orating,
of standing well out on the floor and
shaking his fist at Mr. GLADSTONE.
Had he been still with us, a Commoner,
he would, but for technical difficulty,
have been Father of the House. He
took his seat as Member for East
Gloucestershire sixty-three years ago.
As far as I know no contemporary of
that far-off period, which found PEEL in
the plenitude of his power, sits in the
House to-day. Unseated in East
Gloucestershire in 1846, he was a few
months out of the House, being in 1847
elected for Haddingtonshire, a constitu-
ency he represented for thirty-six years.
But the interval, *...; to the rule,
moved his record forward to the year
1847. A Member to establish his claim
to Fathership of House must have sat
uninterruptedly for a period going back
to the furthest year.
But 1847 would have served. BEACH,
the late Father, killed in hansom cab
accident, did not enter House till 1857.
In ELCHO's case question never arose.
In due course he was called to House of
Lords, where he renewed his youth like
the eagle.

“You’re not old, Father William " the young man said,
“And you've made us a deuce of a name;
You'll be terribly missed from the House you have led—
Well, I'm glad you were here when I came.”

way for multitudinous memoranda, he
moved for a commission “to inquire into
and report upon the present state and
prospects of our trade, and whether
any change in methods is needed in
furtherance thereof.” Possibly of all
Peers it is only Young WEMYss who
would have the audacity in existing
circumstances to move this resolution.
It will be perceived it ignores the fact
that at this moment (though we don't
hear so much of it as we did) there is
sitting a Royal Commission appointed
under the seal of DoN José Rez charged
with this very inquiry.
ſoung WEMYss bent upon making a
speech is not to be deterred by little
considerations of that kind. Brushing
it aside as if it were of no consequence,
he chatted along for a full hour by
Westminster clock. For all purposes
leading to elucidation of the subject, or
to conversion of his audience, he might
have gone on for another hour or two.
Usually addresses House from cross
hand. Since then fought shy of the
place. Opportunity of addressing Peers
from the table is reserved for Ministers
and ex-Ministers; unofficial Peers speak
from their place wherever they chance
to sit. These arbitrary distinctions are
trifling. If Young WEMYss thinks it
more consonant with his personal pre-
eminence to speak from the Table he
will do so, even as he would address the
House from the Woolsack if he thought
it would be for its moral and intellectual
benefit.
I call it a speech in deference to con-
ventional habit. It was really a soliloquy,
a luxurious wandering over lush pastures

infallibility of the Ninth Earl of WEMYss,

Business done.—In Lords none. In
Commons debate on Education arose
on Vote on Account.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—Rumour
current that Swift MACNEILL has been
“sent for.” Some authorities add that
in forming his Cabinet he has named
REDMOND cadet Lord President of the
Council “on account of his deportment.”
It is added FLAVIN will be Foreign
Secretary “on account of his accent.”
Don't believe a word of it. Idle
rumour based on nothing more substan-
tial than fact that when, just now,
Ministers were beaten in the Division
Lobby, Swift MACNEILL made more noise
than any three of his compatriots bawling
in unison. “Moreover than which "
there is no vacancy for a new Premier.
Ministers haven't resigned and don't
mean to. Such virtuous constitutional
practice as resignation in analogous cir-
cumstances all very well formereliberals.
Unionists stand on higher platform.
Admittedly the circumstances are
from outside point of view precisely
parallel with what took place on June 21,
1895. House then in Committee of
Supply; reduction of vote moved in order
to indict War Office for neglect to supply
arsenals with sufficient stock of cordite.
No crisis anticipated; no sign of excite-
ment. C.-B. on Treasury Bench in
charge of votes looked sleepily around,
wondered when they'd cut the cackle
and come to the vote. Members strolled
out languidly to Division Lobby; came
back to leap into frenzied excitement on
learning that Government had been
defeated by majority of seven.
There parallel abruptly terminates.
C.-B. promptly acceded to proposal to
report progress. House adjourned. On
resuming on the Monday—the blow fell
on a Friday--announcement was made in
both Houses that Ministers had placed
their resignation in the hands of Her
MAJESTY. It had been accepted, and
there an end on't.
This afternoon Unionist Ministry
were defeated by majority which, though
small, was more than fifty per cent. in
excess of that which wrecked the
RosebERY Administration. PRINCE ARTHUR,
casually strolling in, was met by
demand to report progress. Has suffered
much of late at hands of unreasonable
gentlemen opposite. They have wanted
to know all about the Scrap of Paper;
they have insisted upon being informed
as to minutest details of what they call
the “jockeying” of RITCHIE and GEORGIE
HAMILTON out of Cabinet; they have
insisted upon mastering niceties of
difference between Retaliation and DoN
José's scheme of fiscal reform. These
things have been suffered, not gladly,
but with certain heroic patience.
This last eccentricity goes a step
too far. PRINCE ARTHUR gazed on the
excited throng before him with icy
stare that would chill any but those
born with Celtic blood. He beheld
Swift MACNEILL bobbing about on the
bench like a pea in a hot frying pan.
He saw REDMOND cadet elate with
memory of having waved somebody
else's hat when the figures of the division
were announced, and so saved his own
from wear and tear. He found RED-
MOND aimé on his feet, with something
more than customary of portentous
manner, moving to report progress.
Has heard about madness besetting
hares in this month of March. Surely
the mood is contagious and has gripped
mankind. Why report progress 2
Nothing has happened except that Irish

Friday night.—Been a good deal of
talk during the week about Passive
Resisters. Quite time they had a look
in at Westminster. Among doubtless
unpremeditated consequences of DoN
José's setting heather afire with torch
of Protection is the fact that some thou-
sands of estimable people, who have
varied monotony of obscure lives by
going to prison rather than pay Educa-
tion rate, have found the newspapers with
no room for enlarging on their case,
whilst Parliament has never heard of it.
“What is the first recorded case of
Passive Resistance?” the MEMBER FOR
SARK asked as we talked this matter
over.
“Give it up.”
“Why SHADRACH, MESHACH, ABEDNEGo
and the Fiery Furnace. Overhaul the
Wollum, as Cap'en CUTTLE used to say,
and you'll find how singularly close,
in the spirit if not in the letter, are two
series of events happening in Babylon
under King NEBUCHADNEzzAR and in
England...under His Most Gracious
Majesty King Edward THE SEVENTh.”
Business done.—Private Members'.
THE CRY OF THE FLAT FISH.
[Lord ONSLow's Bill “to provide against the
destruction of undersized flat fish” is engaging
the attention of a Select Committee of the
Upper House.]
My Lords, whose sober counsels curb
The zeal of frenzied nations,
Be not annoyed that we disturb
Your calm deliberations.
The tribe of Pleuronecticias
(Salute the voice of science')
Approach as suppliants: their plea
Defence and not defiance.
While England boasts her azure wall,
The billows that surround her,
She dare not disregard the call
Of turbot, plaice and flounder.
“Not on thy sole.”—you know the rest,
But let the trite quotation
Stand while the race of soles protest
Against extermination.
Our elders, patient and content,
Their pound of flesh surrender;
Shylock himself must needs relent
Towards the young and tender.
Let full-grown fishes feel the smart
Of human persecutions:
But do not play the coward's part,
To war with Lilliputians.
Reflect that such untimely fate
Is just the way to spoil us;
O let us grow to man's estate
Before you catch and boilus.
Belov'd of coster and of cat
With well-deserved affection,
Weak, harmless, undersized and flat,
We crave your kind protection!

have your revenge upon him. See, here are foils. I will
remove the button from one and poison the point. (He does so.)
We will get up a fencing match between you and HAMLET

to pink him with the foil, I will drop something into this

summon HAMLET, and invite the QUEEN and Court to witness
the proceedings! (A pause. Enter QUEEN and Court, HAMLET

HOW TO SPEND A HAPPY EVENING;
OR, MR. PUNCH's ANTIDOTE To MUSICAL
CoMEDY.
| By way of counteracting the deplorable
frivolity of the age and stimulating the
intellectual efficiency of the nation, Mr.
Punch, never unready to improve on
his contemporaries, has decided to insti-
tute a series of Literary Competitions
for the young, specially suited to the
requirements of the present crisis in
our educational system. Virtue being
its own reward, and the bestowal of
an honorarium on one person being
notoriously calculated to excite jealousy
and disappointment amongst unsuccess-
ful competitors, Mr. Punch has resolved
to abstain from offering prizes, especially
as these competitions are designed to lead
back to a strenuous life those persons
whose idleness is the fruit of affluence.
(A). Construct a sonnet, the lines in
which shall end with the following
rhymes:– Duke
doze
— disclose
rebuke
snook

—— Rose-
—— forsook
authority

—— majority

— retaliation

(B). Put into the Parliamentary lan-
guage of the House of Commons the
following:—
“You may say that is “only Pretty
FANNY's way,' but if these are the expres-
sions of a gentleman speaking under
great heat and provocation—I say that if
a man cannot curb his tongue better
than that, “Pretty FANNY' should not be
First Lord of the Treasury.”
(C). Translate into Hebrew the follow-
ing paragraph:-
“No one can say that we are an irre-
ligious people so long as church parade
is so well patronised as on last Sunday.

This is indeed good news:–

Prussian Minister of Public Works, is devot-
ing himself to the simplification of titles borne
by railway officials. His first order is that
in future “Hilfsfahrkartenausgeberinnen,
Telegraphistinnen oder Abfertigungsgehilf-
innen” shall be compelled to lose their
individual titles, which are to be merged into
the humbler one of “Eisenbahnaushelferin.”
(“railway assistant”).
It is to be hoped that this excellent
idea of the Prussian Minister's will not
be nipped in the BUDDE.

“AUTHENTIC BLUNDERS."
STIMULATED by the infectious example
of the correspondents of the Spectator, a
number of personages, eminent in
various high callings, have communi-
cated to us examples of “Authentic
blunders” for which they are personally
prepared to vouch. The following
letters, we need hardly say, are only a
small selection from the myriads which
have blocked our letter-box during the
last week:- :
DEAR SIR,-When I was an under-
duate at Balliol, I was invited to

stranger who was strangely silent.
Wishing to cheer him up...I said, “Have
you heard HERBERTSPENCER's latest riddle
about Lord ActoN ?” ... On his replying
in the negative, I went on : “Why is
ACTON's condition hopeless? Because
he's past Ealing and on the road to
Hanwell.”. Imagine my feelings when
the Master informed me that my neigh-
bour was none other than the amiable
and omniscient Peer himself! Happily
I was subsequently enabled to make the
amende, honorable in one of my books

from myself, I feel that no excuse is
needed for recalling the incident.

is technically known as metaphasia,
recently asked me if I had read a novel
called. The Lovely Florists. On my
inquiring who was the author, he replied
“HoRACE MEwlett.” I am, Sir,

DEAR SIR,-At an amateur performance
of Julius Caesar in my native town of
Tipperary, the part of Mark Antony was
taken by the local house-agent, who
brought down the house with the line:
“See what a rint the envious CASCA paid!”
Yours, &c. X. Y. Z.

ALL THE TALENTS AT DALY'S.
If pretty faces, shapely forms, in exceptionally brilliant
costumes designed by Y ANDERSON, plenty of life, go, and
brightest coloured scenery by Hawes CRAVEN, much fun from
the WRIGHT man in the right place, as Chambhuddy Ram,
assisted by Miss GRACIE fº as Peggy Sabine, LIONEL
Moxckton's pleasant music, and WILLIE WARDE's wonderful
dances, if such a combination, in which must be included
the work and play of Messrs. TANNER, Ross, GREENBANK, and
RUBENs, should fail to repeat the usual success that Mr.
GEORGE EdwardEs seems invariably to command wherever he
starts a show of this sort, then the indefatigable Manager
must come to his own rescue and try some other device.
Whatever may be now lacking in the way of a song that
will catch on is sure to be supplied by the talented co-comic-
operative company.
Mr. HAYDEN CofFIN is just what the musical hero Harry
Vereker would be if he were Mr. HAYDEN CoFFIN. He has
pretty music to sing, but nothing that will come up to his
“Queen of my Heart to-night.” No doubt within another
few weeks something specially attractive will be found for
him. Mr. RUTLAND BARRINGTON has no song equal to that
about the “six little, five little" (and so forth diminuendo)
wives; but he does inimitably what little he has to do, and
his costumes are marvellous.
Miss Isabel, JAY looks magnificent and sings delightfully;
though here again her song about the Japs does not excite
the furore it was evidently written to arouse. |
Having mentioned JAY, we come in alphabetical order to
KAYE. i. FRED KAYE has a catch phrase about “the climate,”
and cuts a very droll figure as Sir Peter Loftus, High
Commissioner (five-feet-high Commissioner) and Judge,
Ceylon. Nature has made ºul. KAYE” just the very man
for a small part, and has been so economical with his inches
that 'tis quite impossible we can have too much of him.
Miss Sybil, ARUNDALE possesses a sweet contralto voice, and
does full justice to the part of Nunoya, the pretty, coquettish,
dark-eyed Cingalese girl. The best number, and the
most loudly encored, is the quartette for Numoya, Harry,
Naitoema (a part capitally played by Miss CARRIE MooRE)
and Willie Wilson represented by Mr. J. Bobby, who is
not a mere any-Boddy, but a somebody as a bass singer.
To the experienced Mr. WILLIE WARDE the greatest praise is
due for his admirably contrived dances and his stage-manage-
ment of crowds, over whom he is able to keep !. ward
when appearing on the stage as an Indian servant, Myamgah,
whose unobtrusive pantomime is genuinely artistic.
As for Mr. HUNTLEY WRight, the fun of the piece depends
almost entirely upon his rendering of the Baboo Lawyer,
whom everyone familiar with ANSTEY GUTHRIE’s Mr. Jabberjee
(whose comments and adventures originally achieved so great
a fame in Mr. Punch's pages) cannot fail to recognise. The
authors have privately, as we hear, acknowledged their
indebtedness to the creator of Mr. Jabberjee; perhaps this
tribute to Mr. GUTHRIE may take a more substantial form than
that of mere complimentary gratitude. The Baboo student
of the Temple is as amusing on the stage as he is in Mr.
GUTHRIE’s pages, and not a point is lost by Mr. HUNTLEY
WRIGHT. A i. between him and Miss GRACIE LEIGH goes
with much laughter, but it is not on a par with some of its
predecessors.
There is one remarkable fact about the Cingalese at Daly's.
Whatever may be the tint of their faces-—brown, reddish-
brown, or dark olive—their hands (and arms when visible)
are just the colour of an ordinary Cockney's. The male
Cingalese chorus and supers do not throw themselves, so
completely into their characters as did the gentleman who,
in order to play Othello, blacked himself all over. The piece
is half-an-hour too long.
ON SATURDAY, NEXT SATURDAY.
ON Saturday, next Saturday, the twenty-sixth of March,
When other folks are breakfasting or getting out of bed—
Where Putney Bridge divides the flood with buttress and
with arch,
Two Eights shall start for victory (and one shall go ahead),
Oh it's getting to your stake-boat that makes you shake
and shiver,
Where the launches all are fretting in the middle of the
river;
And it's taking off your sweater, and it's gripping
of your oar, -
With your coxswain looking glum,
While a deep expectant hum
Comes like surges of a stormy sea that beats upon
the shore;
And it's “Steady, are you ready?” and you lie there side
by side,
Till the Umpire's flashing pistol sets you racing on the
tide
When other folks are breakfasting or getting out of bed,
On Saturday, next Saturday §§. I shan't be late),
There'll be a roar of cheering to waken all the dead
At Putney when the racing crews get off at thirty-eight.
Oh it's swinging it and driving it that makes you move
your bellows;
And it's watching (which you shouldn't do) the other
puffing fellows;
And it's giving her ten hard ones and straining
like an ox
With your muscles on the crack
In your shoulders and your back,
As you hear the frantic orders of your agitated Cox.
And it’s “Mortlake, weary Mortlake, I wish you weren't
so far,”
And the Cox yells, “Now you're gaining,” and, by Jingo,
so you are!
On Saturday, next Saturday, may I be there to greet
Those sixteen jolly Englishmen a-tugging for the lead.
And eight shall have the victory and eight must bear defeat,
But what's the odds since . have pluck—and that's the
thing we need.
Oh it's rowing in a stern chase that makes you feel
you're dying,
But it's spurting, gaining, spurting that makes you
think you're flying;
And it's smiting the beginning and it's sweeping
of it through
Just for honour, not for pelf,
And without a thought of self,
For the glory of your colour and the credit of your
crew.
And it’s “Easy all, you've passed the post,” and lo,
rou loose your grip,
But not until the falling flag proclaims you're at the
“Ship.” R. C. L.

Mr. Herbert Paul.
Lord Rosebery. My Lords, Sir GILBERT
PARKER, and Gentlemen, we are met to
discuss a problem which I own has
of late moved me profoundly. I think
we must all agree that to dispense with
invective altogether would impose too
great a strain on the forbearance of
public men. For how otherwise could
we repudiate calumny, how express our
righteous indignation? For my own
part, ever since I entered upon my lonely
furrow I have found it hard to avoid
calling a spade a spade, or a slate a
slate. But there must of course be
some limits. It would be incorrect as
well as offensive, for example, to call
the Premier “Ugly FRANCEs.” Where
then must the line i. drawn 2
Mr. T. P. O'Connor. My own feeling
is that there should be no invective.
The first rule of conduct for a man
aspiring to public honours should be,
acquire superlatives; the second, acquire
superlatives; and the third, acquire
superlatives.
Mr. R. W. Perks. But suppose some-
thing arises that demands castigation?
Mr. O'Connor. Change the subject.
Mr. Perks. Personally, I see no objec-
tion to calling a Prime Minister “Pretty
FANNY.” Pretty, I take it, is not a term
of abuse. I understand that many of
the inhabitants of these islands, high and
low, would give their ears to merit the
adjective. And FANNY 2 Is not FANNY
a name in high honour? Was there not
FANNY Burney, a distinguished novelist;
FANNY KEMBLE, a distinguished actress;
FANNY--—
The Speaker. Would the noble lord
our Chairman justify a reference to, say,
Mr. CHAPLIN as Little MARY 2
Lord Rosebery. It is not a name I
should have myself bestowed.
Mr. Perks. Noblesse oblige.
Mr. William Watson. fºls perhaps
are entitled to a wider licence than
statesmen. Personally, if returned to
Parliament, I should never think of
restraining any impulse to condemn
what I did not think right. Whoever op-
posed me would have to expect a sonnet.
The Speaker. Sonnets are not in order
—at least, not more than one, a very short
one, used as a quotation for rhetorical
urposes. -
Mr. Watson. But if a publicist could
become articulate in no other way—
like myself and Canon RAwNSLEY 2
Mr. Labouchere. I fear your chances
of catching the Speaker's eye would be
remote.
Mr. Watson. Oh indeed! Then I
should group the Speaker with ABDUL
...”
Mr. Perks. ABDUI, the . . .
Mr. Watson. The same. -
The Speaker. Then stick to Parnassus;
do not court Parliament. We are a simpſe
prosaic folk, not in the least sonnety.
Mr. Labouchere. The best rule for
Parliamen
rou think. n't beat about the bush.
ust tell the truth, and your reputation
as a cynic will be made; and once a
reputation is made in Parliament it is
never allowed to drop. I once made the
mistake of composing a joke, and ever
since then I have been labelled witty.
But no stranger who hears me now would
apply any such epithet.
The Speaker. Certainly not.
Mr. Labouchere. Why do you say
certainly not?.
The Speaker. I thought you would
like to find some one in agreement.
Mr. Labouchere. No, Sir, no cynic
likes to be agreed with. Directly he
is agreed with he ceases to be a cynic.
Mr. Bernard Shaw. The great fault
success is to say what ||
with Parliamentary invective is that it is
employed against political opponents.
Now there is no fun in abusing the other
side; the superman abuses his own.
Why seek for enemies when one has so
many friends available for obloquy?
Mr. Austen Chamberlain. My august
father writes that it is very hard that in
a country which prides itself upon free
speech there should be any censorship.
He goes on to remark that he would
like to see a tax put upon unnecessary
magnanimity. I might add, as a matter
of some interest to the company, that
my august father's inability to take
things lying down forces him to sleep
either in a sitting or a vertical position.
This serves to show that the higher
patriotism is not without its sacrifices.
Mr. Labouchere. The best thing to do
when one has something unparliamen-
tary to say is to keep it until one is
addressing one's constituents. At North-
ampton I say things for which, at West-
minster, I should ‘. put in the Clock
Tower.
Sir Gilbert Parker. Is there really a
| Clock Tower? I have not noticed it.
Mr. Labouchere. Certainly; but you
are not likely to trouble it much. And
a man who never risks the Clock Tower
never does anything.
Sir Gilbert Parker. But I don't think
one ought to risk the Clock Tower. I
think one's language should betray
courtesy, clarity, and conviction.
Mr. Watson. Would not a dictionary
of allowable phrases and epithets be a
useful book for distribution in the
House? A standard work of reference on
those lines would sensibly simplify the
duties of the legislator.
Sir Gilbert Parker. Our noble Chair-
man carries Dr. MURRAy's New English
Dictionary about with him. Why should
not all of us do so?
Mr. Labouchere. We can if we like;
it is merely a question of sufficient
retainers.
Mr. Watson. Is it allowable to say,
“You’re another” 2
Lord Rosebery. It depends on the
initial statement.
Mr. O'Connor. Allow me in the most
heartfelt manner to utter a solemn plea
for universal tolerance. There has been
too much vituperation; let us enter upon
a period of compliments. Our golden
rule should be, Whenever you see a
head, pat it.
Mr. Herbert Paul (sotto voce). With a
pat of butter. (Aloud.) The question
before us is, What are the limits of
invective? Might not our course be
dictated by the famous counsel of a by-
ne editor to his staff of reviewers: “F
just, be merciful; but when you do meet
with a silly ass, string him up” 2

#5.3%), the Jukt of Cambringt.
Born : 1819. Died : MARCH 17, 1904.
THE years that saw old systems changed to new
Still left his spirit changeless to the end
Who served his kindred's throne a long life through,
And died, as he had lived, the soldier's friend.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN the Red Leaguers (METHUEN) Mr. SHAN F. BULLock
accomplishes a tour de force. There are many novels whose
drama is played out in Ireland in times of seething sedition
or open rebellion. But the authors have gone back to '98,
or at latest to the famine epoch of the mid-nineteenth
century. Mr. Bullock boldly plunges on to the threshold of
the twentieth century. He imagines a state of thin
existing in Ireland after the Boer War when, as he puts it,
“England stood bound hand and foot. One stroke and
Ireland was free, a nation at last. A vast organisation of
true Irishmen had been formed, with capable leaders at
its head, and branches spreading through the world.
Through Ireland itself ran a huge confederacy, guided,
controlled, with branches in every parish. One man
was at the head; under him were leaders; under them
the Irish people. All was secret, all were sworn.”
This is the dream of some Irishmen before and since
the time of EMMET. Mr. BULLock realises it in vigorous
and graphic detail. He follows the fortune of one rebel
band under the command of a soldier of fortune named Shaw.
The narrative is so precise and powerful that emotionable
| people like my Baronite will as they read pinch their thumbs
to assure themselves they are not dreaming. Designedly or
not, certainly without obvious effort, Mr. BULLock informs
his stirring story with a moral over which honest, if extreme,
Nationalists ... well to ponder.
Part 2, Bygone Eton (SpottiswooDE & Co., Ltd.), interesting
to Etonians. Here is dreary “Long Chamber,” concernin
which much might be written entitled “Devilments an
Diverse Dormitorv Diversions.” Illustration No. VI. shows
a section of the Library, where among certain treasures is
kept “a play written in 1534 by NicoLAs UDALL, Head Master
of Eton.” It has never been produced. Surely here is a
chance for the “Stage Society,” or for Mr. TREE's new
dramatic school.
My Baronite thanks Messrs. HopDER AND Stoughton for
introducing him to Pa-Gladden. “The Story of a Common
Man,” Miss WAltz adds by way of explanation. It is, also,
the story of a beautiful, strenuous, unselfish life. Pa Gladden
is the kind of man who is made only in the broad prairie
lands of America. He is fortunate in having at hand authors,
usually women, who perceive his goodness and are able to
communicate it to others. He is a hard-working, not
too wealthy, farmer, with a strong belief in the goodness
and unremitting care of “the Onspeakable One.” Kind-
hearted but shrewd, thinking no evil, but taking care that
it shall not approach those dear to him, he goes his daily
round, shedding sunshine everywhere. One of his greatest
triumphs is the subduing of his horse Cephy, a beast so
savage that no one could keep him. So Pa Gladden got him
cheap. Pa is the happy centre of everything. But Miss
WALTz's magic pen also draws the reader into charmed com-
munion with the strangely-named quaint men and women who
people a Kentucky hamlet. Reading the work has the whole-
some invigorating effect of filling the lungs with breath from
the fresh winds that blow over the blue grass.
The Baron, setting aside the illogical plea in Mr. ARNOLD
WHITE's elaborate ºil." can only give his opinion
on ex-Lieutenant BILSE's novel as a work founded by its author
(according to the evidence before the court-martial as reported
in the Appendix) on facts within his own personal experi-
ence. For writing and publishing such work the court-
martial judged him, Lieutenant Oswald BILSE, “guilty of
having libelled his superior officers and others in higher
rank than himself, in a manner which has resulted in serious
consequences to them. Further, he has disobeyed a stringent
military order, namely, the Imperial regulation regarding the
literary activity of persons in military service.” His punish-
ment was six months' imprisonment and dismissal from the
service. The Baron, as a strict martinet, having read the
clever translation of the ex-Lieutenant's book, emphasizes
this verdict with “Sarve him right.” If ex-Lieutenant BiLSE
had sent in his resignation first, and had been quit of the
army before publishing his novel, civil actions for libel
might have followed, or a private inquiry might have been
instituted by the highest military authorities, with beneficial
results. Is this Life in a Garrison Town (John LANE) to be taken
as a fair specimen of all life in all garrison towns in Germany
Is it to be ea: uno disce omnes? Or, is this case exceptional?
Publish achronique scandaleuse of the recklessly wicked doings
of the Dirty-First Regiment quartered at Stow-in-the-hole, are
we therefore to accuse the entire British Army of the grossest
impropriety, of general dishonesty, of universal inebriety, of
total lack of discipline in all quarters, and to tar the ladies
of the garrison, the officers' wives, with the same brush?
The Baron, at the bureau of just criticism, compliments the
translator on his work, yet must he say to the ex-Lieutenant,
“Cassio, I love thee; 3. nevermore be officer of mine.”
Ex-Lieutenant Bilse cannot be congratulated on his un-
savoury novel, but he may be fairly credited with the best
intentions in writing and publishing it.
Guy Boothby's Consummate Scoundrel (F. W. WHITE & Co.)
receives the Baron's commendation, up to a certain point.
Curiosity is aroused: there is the mystery which envelops a
disappearing man : there is of course a thorough-going
villain, and so forth. The commencement is distinctly good:
so is the working up to the climax. But the climax is
disappointing.
Mr. Theo. Douglas has chosen a difficult form for his latest
novel, Miss Caroline (ARNOLD), and has achieved a remarkable
success. It is as though the heroine were writing her own
story from notes made in her diary, but the narrative is so
cleverly contrived as to run on smoothly without the ordinary
mechanical marking time by a constant record of days and
dates. Caroline herself is a charming type. Every character
essential to the gradual development of a thoroughly interest-
ing plot is most skilfully drawn.
The strongly dramatic inci- BARON
dents are finely treated without
the slightest suspicion of any-
thing approaching mere melo-
dramatic sensationalism. There
is a freshness about the entire
story that warrants the Baron in
strongly recommending all who
honour him by accepting his
guarantee for the genuine merit
of any novel tomake theacquaint-
ance of this delightful ingénue at
the very earliest date possible.

PERKS AND THE PROMISE OF SPRING.
[Mr. R. W. PERKs, M.P., in opening a Free Methodist bazaar, is
reported by the Daily Chronicle to have remarked that “he was sorry
to see that when the Rev. Mr. CAMPBELL wanted to go to Court he asked
the Bishop of London to present him. What would have been said in
days gone by if Puritan preachers ... . had asked Archbishop Laud to
present them to King CHARLEs 2 Mr. CAMPBELL would have been far
better advised had he asked the veteran leader of London Nonconformity,
Dr. GUINNEss Rogers . . . to introduce him to King Edward, instead
of hanging on to the apron-strings of an Anglican Bishop."]
Now ºf: the slough of bursting seeds
The vital sap begins to hurtle;
Now Nature doffs her winter weeds
And dons her gaudy-coloured kirtle;
Now to the thrush's limpid lay,
Encored for joy in throbbing quavers,
With gold and purple bravely gay
The crocus flaunts his regal favours.
It is the piping time of bards,
When every little fledgling hummer
Still superstitiously regards
Spring as the harbinger of summer.
It is the time when Cupid's choirs
Announce a course of love-recitals,
Responsive to the usual fires
New-lit in adolescent vitals.
And, in the swift infectious glow
That makes you even love your neighbours,
Our very Churches seem to grow
Less keen on crossing ghostly sabres.
Yet, as beneath the rose there lurks
A latent element of bramble,
So with the Spring comes Mr. PERKs
Scratching the eyes of Mr. CAMPBELL.
Within the City Temple's bound
What heresy has dared to enter,
That he should leap from underground
Dissenting from a co-dissenter 2
That reverend politician's soul
What blight has marred? what moral blister?
Has he renounced his leading rôle
Of Passive, but Superb, Resister?
Has he denied his Liberal past?
Or, envious of a rival Triton,
Secured, by way of counterblast,
The old Aquarium down at Brighton?
No! he has done a deadlier thing
Than paying rates or buying fish up;
He's been to bow before the KING,
Conducted by (O Heaven!) a Bishop."
Why could not one of his own creed,
Like Dr. Rogers—not to mention
R. W. P.-have done the deed
Without his Laudship's intervention?
See how the lure of Satan works
Through lust of social pride and sleekness,
Striking the uncorrupted PERKs
Pink with contempt for human weakness!
Ah, Sir! the Spring that binds her spell
About the beasts and feathered creatures,
Woos also you; you might as well
Relax awhile your Christian features.
But if her voice appeals in vain;
If you ignore the lambkin's bleating,
And that inveterate refrain
That marks the cuckoo's vernal greeting;-
If still you grudge the Spring her due,
And Earth her claims as common Mother—
Think how it cheers the Lord High HUGH
To see dissenters bruise each other! O. S.

I.—THE MANIPULATOR of PUBLICs.
As I sat at lunch in a Strand res-
taurant a gentleman at my table called
somewhat ostentatiously for more ice.
He was a small man; one would
describe him as dapper; he was almost
painfully alert, and his manner of eating
showed him to be methodical to a fault.
He seemed to do nothing that was not
absolutely necessary. I felt certain that
in his business hours he used the
sharply waxed ends of his moustache
for ºff.
More ice was brought, and he lighted
a cigarette. After a puff or two he held
the end which he had put to his mouth
against a block of ice. Then he smoked
again and then repeated the operation,
with a side glance at me. He caught
my eye.
“Why do you do that?” I inquired,
“if the question is not impertinent.”
“Not at all,” he answered. “To be
candid, I wanted you to ask. A client
of mine intends shortly to place on the
market an iced cigarette. I am creating
a demand for it.”
“That's very friendly of you.”
“I said client, not friend,” he returned
sharply. “Creating demands is my
profession. I am a Manipulator of
Publics.”

“Never heard of them.”
“Probably not. That's because you
don't think.” I winced. “How do you
suppose a new thing is brought into
notice?”
“By advertisement, I imagine,”, I
said, with the air of one who states the
obvious.
“Yes,” he admitted, “but go farther
back. Who reads advertisements—with
any interest, that is ? Why, people
who want things. Nobody at present
wants iced cigarettes "because they
haven't thought of them. Once get the
idea into men's heads that they would be
good things and they'll read advertise-
ments to find out where to buy them.”
“You surprise me.”
“I expected to. You would like to
hear some more of my methods?”
“I should,” I said. “This cigarette
business strikes me as just a trifle
crude, and ”—Iglanced round the room
—“not particularly effective.”
“Crudeness is one of my strong
points,” he replied; “when you object
to it you show your ignorance of the
British Public. You expect them to
copy my experiment now at once.
National shyness is against that. But
come here to-morrow, and I'm willing to
wager that at least five men will cool
the ends of their cigarettes with ice.

standing customs, fads and prejudices.
lake the case of the Daily Torch. That
was one of my enterprises. It was not
my paper, of course, but I prepared the
public for it. One would have said
there was no room for another new
paper, and, in fact, there was not. I
made room. I knew that the English
people have a prejudice in regard to
the use of newspapers for lighting fires.
In all respectable establishments, one
week's issue of ephemeral literature is
hoarded up until the next week begins.
Then, and only then, is the kitchen-maid
at liberty to divert the accumulations to
household purposes. Well, confident in
this knowledge, Iwaited for the English
summer. It came in November, and
W. marvellous luck it began on a
onday. I immediately made a corner
in old newspapers. People were ready
enough to sell them for good prices,
because there is another British preju-
dice against having fires in summer,
however cold it may be, and because no
amount of experience to the contrary
ever really convinces them that the
English summer does not come to stay.
Secure in the confidence that they were
in for a spell of warm weather—a ‘heat
wave,' they called it—they sold me
their stock of old newspapers. By the
Thursday, the English summer had
definitely broken up, and four degrees
of frost drove them back to fires. ere

was my opportunity. I placarded Eng-
land with “Buy the Daily Torch and
Light Your Fires with it.’ It went (as
it should) like wild-fire. The fact that
it was intended for lighting fires was
sufficient to overcome the weekly-accu-
mulation prejudice.”
“But how did you keep it going?” I
asked.
“There I utilised my knowledge of
an ancient British custom. I knew that
kitchen-maids always read the paper
before they burn it, so a special appeal
was made to kitchen-maids. There was
a column headed ‘The Daily Peer-Glass:
all about Fashion and High-life,’ and it
caught them. After that we naturally
jumped into a circulation guaranteed
to be equal to fifteen times that of any
London daily.”
“Good heavens!” I exclaimed. “You
work on the quiet, but you certainly
don't do things by halves.”
“No,” he replied. “I do them by
wholes and corners. Bill, waiter, please.”
WE understand that the article on
“Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT's Old Ties”
which appeared in one of the papers
on the occasion of the veteran's an-
nouncement of his projected withdrawal
from public life, is to be followed by
“Mr. BALFOUR's Left-off Spats,” and “Mr.
GIBSON Bowles' Discarded Ducks.”

HINTS ON HATS.
(By our Millinery Expert.)
ExCELLENT advice under the heading “How to choose a
Hat” is offered to the readers of the Daily Express, but
some of the items require a little explanation for the benefit
of the uninitiated. Every woman, says the Daily Express,
should first acquaint herself with the faults or perfections of
the back of her head as well as the front. We endorse this
up to a certain point, but there is a risk in some cases that
overstudy in this direction may lead to a general predilection
for the rear aspect.
Many women, we are next told, might be called beauties if
they would only realise it. This is not a common difficulty.
The only obstacle which the majority has to contend with
is a growing disinclination on the part of their friends to
appreciate the fact.
The toque—the article goes on to remark—should always
be bewitchingly perched above a saucy little nose. That is
so, and this advice also applies to the Picture hat, the Early
Victorian, the Capeline ombrelle, -and even the Panama is
better worn above rather than below that salient point.
There are cases, we are told, when a hat is more becoming
to one profile than the other, but a little trouble will obviate
the discrepancy. This, however, is too vague for the general
public. The only practical remedy is to buy two hats, one
to suit each profile, split them down the middle and join the
two desirable halves with a little fish glue and stamp paper.
The remaining moieties may be similarly connected, and
dispatched in one of “Gainsborough's " hat boxes, as a
birthday present to a country cousin.
The girl with the wide mouth, large nose and high cheek-
bones is recommended to avoid elose-fitting shapes, as
somewhat risky to her particular style. While concurring
with this we suggest that if, in adition, the chin recedes
to any extent and the eyes are inclined to goggle, a very
chaste effect may be obtained by wearing a coal-scuttle
bonnet (now in vogue), and the back hair elaborately
coiffured. The bonnet in this case should always be worn
hind side before.

THE WARIETY ENTERTAINMENT.
SoME people delight to argue and fight,
Whenever occasion arises,
Of the merits which fall to the drama and hall,
And the influence each exercises.
One tells you the play will have soon had its day—
It is only an ancient survival,
Which of course cannot hope in its dotage to cope
With its brilliant and up-to-date rival;
While the others say No! the variety show
Is only a whim of the moment,
And fashion will learn in due course to return
To SHAKSPEARE and FLETCHER and BEAUMONT;
Or new stars will arise in theatrical skies,
And the world once again will be brought to
Appreciate Art, while the Halls will depart,
As, without any question, they ought to.
Both are right—both are wrong. My opinion is strong,
After hearing the matter debated,
That the truth is the mean which is lying between
The dual extremes I have stated.
In the play-house to-be we shall certainly see
The programme that pleases the million
Will become a fresh brew of Lyceum and New,
Combined with the Met. and Pavilion.
It will have just a touch too of BENSON.—not much—
And a dash of the Hippodrome's certain
To wind up the show with a turn that will go,
And ensure you a popular curtain.
It will cut matters short and best show you the sort
Of thing that will set the world humming
If I sketch you the bill which is destined to fill
Play-houses in years that are coming.
Turn one should be bright—something comic and light-
Say, costers enjoying a beano,
Just a trifle in which one might see Little TICH
Supported by Mr. DAN LENo.
Turn two-let us say, a Shakspearean play,
Boiled down, and performed by Miss TERRY,
While I think number three with advantage might be
Twenty minutes of gay Madame Sherry.
Then I'd have a trapeze, or some highly trained fleas,
For so fond of variety we are—
Next a scene from Macbeth where the dagger of death
Is prepared by the tragic Miss FREEAR;
While to follow up that, any turn would fall flat
After Duncan's unspeakable slaughter
But the elephants' leap when they rush down the steep
And plunge into real liquid water.

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH,
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, March 21.
—The Irishman's heart is the home of
many fine feelings, such as love of
country, of family, of home, of the
traditions of a high-spirited, richly-gifted
race. Most deeply seated of all is the
love of order. Trained in patience born
of woes that through the centuries have
fallen on his distressful country, he has
taught himself to bear most distasteful
things. Anything approaching breach
of order breaks down the barriers of his
placid manner, rousing him to almost
uncontrollable indignation.
All Irish Members suffer on such
occasions; in the particular cases of
ntlemen of the temperament of Swift
AcNEILL and REDMOND cadet, horror of
disorder makes them almost clamorous.
Judge of their feelings just now when
SEELY rose to continue debate on C.-B.'s
vote of censure upon Ministers in matter
of Chinese labour in the Rand, and the
Chamberlainites went for him like a
pack of hounds that have just nosed
the scent.
SEELY objects to importation of Chinese.
Claims the right of free-born Englishman
rising in the very palladium of liberty to
statehis opinion. After indulgence in pro-
miscuous burst of howling the gentlemen
of England ranged under Unionist flag
or, THE PARLIAMENTARY
St. SEBASTIAN.
REsign ATION:
“I seem to be attacked from so many
quarters that in all probability this is the last
time 1 shall address this House.”—Major Seely.
WINSTON AND SIR TROUT.
(A Study in Deportment.)
Sir Trout. “The vulgarest expression, Sir, came from this honourable Member 1"
fell into conversation. This is a little
rude when one is making ordered speech.
Aggravation increased by loudness of
voice. As at certain stages of a drama
supers at the back of the stage fall into
groups of three or four and, with much
gesticulation, enter into animated con-
versation, so the gentlemen of England
on benches immediately behind that by
which SEELY stood turned to each other
and talked about the weather at the top
of their voices.
That was the principal difference be-
tween this sudden burst of animated
private talk in the House and on the
stage. You don't hear what the supers,
feigning conversation, say. Remarks of
Honourable Members so boisterous as
entirely to drown SEELY's observations.
After a while up gat WINSTON CHURCHILL.
In manner modified by breadth of Irish
Channel, he also resents anything
approaching disorder in debate. His
interposition on the scene for a moment
added fresh vivacity. Leaping up from
side of Member for Isle of WIGHT, he
seized him by the shoulders and forced
him back into his place. Gentlemen of
England looked on approvingly at what
had uncommonly close º, to a
personal assault. Only WINSTON's win-
ning way of introducing himself to
notice of SPEAKER.
“Sir,” he said, the floor by this means the Member for the Isle of W
clear, “owing to the vulgar clamour
among the Conservative Party I am
quite unable to hear what my hon, friend
is saying.”
At the moment of course SEELY, breath-
less in his seat after this unexpected
assault, was saying nothing. Sir TROUT
obligingly supplied a remark.
“The vulgarest expression,” he said,
wagging his hat at WINSTON, “came
from this honourable Member.”
Swift MACNEILLsobbed aloud; REDMOND
cadet, with hands clasped over his
burning face, attempted to shut out the
painful scene. Mr. FLAVIN hastily left
the House in search of the four police-
men who once carried him out shoulder
high. They might be wanted again.
ter, PRINCE ARTHUR presenting him-
self at Table to wind up debate was
startled by roar of contumely arisin
from Irish camp. “’Yide, 'vide, 'vide!
they shouted. For fully five minutes
the PREMIER stood waiting for a hearing.
“Wide' 'Wide l’ roared Swift MACNEILL,
bounding india-rubber-ball-wise on the
bench, to the terror of compatriots sitting
near him.
“Why didn't you enforce order for
SEELY 2” REDMOND cadet sternly asked.
PRINCE ARTHUR, the only placid person
in the tumultuous scene, remarked that
he had appealed for a hearing for
IGHT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
REDMOND cadet, weeping for departing
order, not to be comforted.
“Let SEELY speak again,” he com-
manded.
This objected to on obvious grounds,
and after some further Yahooing the
PREMIER allowed to speak amid occasional
interruptions.
A striking scene, likely to have pro-
longed influence on debate. Saxon
Members perceive more clearly than
ever that order is the Irishman's first
law. He will have it preserved at any
cost of lung power or display of the
manner traditionally connected with
Donnybrook Fair.
Business done.—Government, resisting
vote of censure, bring up their majority
to fifty-seven.
Wednesday night.—Said Mr. O'MARA
just now, “I am not a lover of dogs in
the abstract.” What breed is a dog in
the abstract?
Conversation turned upon second
reading of Dogs Bill, the one ewe lamb
of the Board of Agriculture as FELLOWEs,
who has charge of it, described it. Up
to to-night Government been , shy in
pressing forward their legislative pro-
gramme. Ordinarily on the eve of Easter
principal Bills have been introduced.
The Dogs Bill a sort of pioneer, sent out
to prepare the way for more important
measures.
Result of endeavour not wholly satis-
factory. Leading provision of Bill
makes it a sort of Early Closing Act
for Dogs.
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew, and dog will have his day,
said Hamlet to his uncle.
“But,” adds Uncle FELLOWEs, in charge
of this Bill, “his day shall close at
sunset. As cycles have a lighting-up
time, movable with the seasons, so dogs
shall have a shutting-up time.”
Between sunset and sunrise no dog
may stray. As Mr. BAILEY said in
moving rejection, it is introducing into
dog life the principle of the South
African compound.
Mr. O'MARA, turning contemplative
gaze from dogs in the abstract to dogs
in the concrete, almost drew tears from
the clerks at the Table when he described
“some poor miserable animal, the joy of
a widowed home, seized by the #. if
it put its head out of doors at night.”
As for Brother WASON, he poured con-
tempt and scorn on a Bill drafted by
some feeble townsman who knew nothing
of the ways of a dog with the sheep.
Whilst he was instructing the Board of
Agriculture in this branch of science the
fingers of the clock touched half-past
seven, and the Bill was talked out.
Debate will have to be begun all over
again on another day, with assurance
that Opposition will be encouraged by
temporary success.
Thus, even in connection with the
household kennel, doth misfortune dog
the steps of a hapless Government.
Business done.-Very little.
Friday night.—Mr. Pickwick DAVIES
(christened ALFRED) is going to prison.
There is precedent for the procedure
to be found in the life of his illustrious
prototype. Mr. PICKwick went to prison
as the result of the famous case of
Bardell v. Pickwick. A Passive Resister
of what he regarded as the infamous
demand of costs put forward by DoDSON
and Fogg, he submitted to incarceration
rather than pay.
“You may try and try and try again,”
said Mr. Pickwick, regarding the dis-
comfited attorneys, as the Member for
CARMARTHEN was accustomed to look
MR. Pickwick IN THE Pound.
(Mr. Alfr—d D-v-s as a Passive Resister refuses
to pay something in the pound.)
across the floor at the ex-Colonial
Secretary smiling on the Treasury
Bench; “but not one farthing of costs
or damages do you ever get from me
if I spend the rest of my existence in
a debtor's prison.”
Our Mr. PICKwick's approaching
retirement does not arise in connection
with a breach of promise case, or as
the result of counter-machinations on
the part of DON José. Convinced of
the iniquity of the rate levied under
the recent Act for the support of de-
nominational education, he has refused
to pay it. An unsympathetic Bench
gave him a fortnight to think the matter
over. If at the termination of that date
he is still recalcitrant he will be haled
to prison, perhaps have his hair cut.
This prospect to be realised in mid-
holiday season, whilst other legislators
are enjoying themselves in town or
country. The Member for CARMARTHEN
faces his fate with the serene dignity,
the unconquerable courage, with which
in an earlier age John HAMPDEN resisted
demand for ship-money.
Business done.—Private Members'.

With brothers numberless to man,

Mrs. Newland. JACK, I believe I've
found out why PARKYNs always ‘my-

he wants to impress upon us the fact
that he has lived in ‘better' houses
than we have. And it's true, you know.
He has ' And I wish—
Mr. N. Of course he has. He was

after ?
Mrs. N. No, it isn't that. And yet—

THE latest development of the cam-
paign against Music Hall sketches is that
the ballet is threatened, and many ladies
may be thrown out of work at a time
when their age will render it difficult
for them to obtain other employment.
It is falsely rumoured that the Govern-
ment, alarmed by the result of recent
Elections, is about to make a bold bid
for the Radical vote by a big surrender
of English rights to France.
The International Dress Exhibition
at the Crystal Palace contains a most
complete historical section, starting with
the leaves in the garden, and finishing
up, inside the building, with the latest
creation of WoRTH. It is exceedingly
interesting to trace how dress, originally
scanty, for a time increased in scope,
and than fell away again to the modern
evening dress.
Meanwhile the tendency among the
sterner sex seems to be to rise superior
to clothes altogether. A man charged
with drunkenness at Liverpool last week
tore his garments to shreds, and faced
the magistrate in his shirt; while, at the
Clerkenwell County Court, Judge EDGE
had to rebuke a solicitor for appearing
before him unrobed.
The anti-corset movement is said to
be spreading to officers of the Guards.
The Municipal Council of Holborn
having illuminated with gas the trans-
parent face of the church clock of St.
Giles-in-the-Fields, the installation was
on March 20 solemnly inaugurated by
the Mayor. It is also whispered that a
new wire litter-box affixed to a lamp-
post will shortly be publicly unveiled,
and started on its career of usefulness
by the insertion of a mayoral speech.
The PRIME MINISTER has been asked to
appoint a Royal Commission to inquire
into the causes of the recent great
increase of lunacy in Great Britain. We
are afraid that the Education Act is
responsible for much of it—especially in
Wales.
The rumour that the CzAR intends to
end the War in Japanese territory has
again been revived. We can only
repeat that Japan has no intention of
annexing Russian soil.
Last year there was a decrease in the
consumption of whisky in this country to
the extent of 1,600,000 gallons. This
is the biggest drop that has occurred
since the year that followed the death
of JANE CAKEBREAD.
It never rains but it pours. Only a

CONVERSATION FOR COMBATANTS.
[“In the preparations for War the Japanese seem to have left nothing
undone to contribute to the smooth working of the Army and Navy. A
ket Russo-Japanese dictionary, styled the Nichi-ro Gunyo Shu-chin
%. in which terms relating to naval and military affairs are chiefly
noted, was published last month. It is proposed to present about 50,000
volumes to the naval and military authorities. In relations of any kind
with the enemy the Japanese will find such a volume most useful.”—
Rear-Admiral INGLEs in the “Daily Telegraph."]
Mr. Punch, strongly approving the wisdom of the above
roposal, ventures to go one better, and present to the
elligerents a companion volume in the form of, a ket
manual of Russo-Japanese conversation suitable to the circum-
stances. He appends a few extracts:--

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
IN a modest little volume Mr. ARTHUR BENSON presents a
singularly able and informing study of the Life of Alfred
Tennyson (METHUEN). He describes his object as threefold:
to give a simple narrative of the career of one of the most
interesting personages of the Nineteenth Century; to
present in TENNyson's own words and writings his view
of the poetical life and character; and to indicate the chief
characteristics of his art. The threefold design, deftly woven,
has been fully accomplished. Mr. BENSON makes due acknow-
ledgment to assistance derived from the Memoir the present
Lord TENNyson wrote of his father. Having read both, my
Baronite prefers the lesser volume. Its author has skimmed
the cream off pails of milk wherever he has found them.
The result is an enlightening, comprehensive review of an
interesting life, immortal work. Mr. BENSON has the gift
of illustrating by a sentence a phase or a character. Of
TENNYson's lamentable excursions into playwriting he says:
“It was as though a musician who had reached almost
perfection on the violin took up at threescore the practice
of the organ.” And what can be better than his charac-
terisation of Jowett : “The refrigerator of timid conver-
sationalists.”
The latest novel by Mr. William LE QUEUx, entitled As We
Forgive Them (F. W. WHITE), is rather suggestive of
the KIPLING refrain, once so popular, “Lest we forget.”
With this inspiration of poet KIPLING's, as Jabberjee would
style him, Mr. LE QUEUx's melodramatic romance has, how-
ever, nothing in common. It is an absorbing story; the
reader is plunged into mystery after mystery, deeper and
deeper, and in the profoundest depth there is ever a depth
profounder still. The most experienced novel-plot detective
will find himself hopelessly, helplessly, in the dark, until
WILLIAM LE Q. appears with his search-light. If, after one
straight-through reading of this strange story, an entire class
had to pass an examination in it, the Baron would much like
to read the answers given by the competitors. Of one thing
he is certain : that the prize would not be awarded to him.
He is afraid he would come out among the last on the list,
even though he were not quite such a goose as to be plucked.
But be it understood that the Baron recommends this
romance to all who like their literary compounds hot, strong,
and not overspiced.
The first volume of the “Literary Lives Series,” edited by
Dr. Robertson NicoLL, published by HoDDER AND STOUGHTON,
is contributed by Mr. GEORGE RUSSELL, who takes MATTHEw
ARNOLD as his subject. We are told that the series is
intended to “furnish biographical and critical studies
of well-known authors of all countries.” As far as bio-
graphical details are forthcoming, in the way of personal
touches revealing character, Mr. RUSSELL has confined himself
to four pages at the end of the volume. It is well done, but
strikes my Baronite as a little inadequate. It is a mere
penn'orth of bread to the inordinate quantity of sack the
author sympathetically provides under the heading Theology.
Out of a volume of two hundred and sixty-nine pages he
devotes fifty-four to this topic.
So much being assigned to this alluring topic, Mr. RUSSELL
has hardly anything to say about that slim volume of
verse on which for some, possibly misguided, people the
fame of MATTHEw ARNOLD is most surely established. These
grumblers will scarcely find compensation in the circum-
stance, testified to on the personal authority of the
biographer, that ARNOLD “used with great solemnity and
deliberation to turn to the East at the Creed in Harrow
School Chapel where the clergy neglected to do so.”
Doubtless ARNOLD was half-bantering when he wrote of
the Young WEMyss, happily still with us in the House of
Lords, “Everybody knows Lord Elcho's personal appearance
and how admirably he looks the part of our governing
classes.” Designedly or accidentally, Mr. RussFLL succeeds
in showing that, side by side with his iterated dislike and
contempt of the middle class, ARNOLD cherished love for a
lord marvellous in a man of his intellectual altitude.
The Baron heartily compliments Mrs. MARY STUART Boyd on
The Man in the Wood (CHAPMAN AND HALL). Her very original
heroine is most captivating, and every character in the
attractive story, which is told with true artistic simplicity, is
finely conceived and drawn with
a firm touch. One point of con-
tact there is with Great Expecta-
tions by CHARLEs DickeNs, and
that is at the commencement,
where Veka, out of pure pity,
helps the escaped convict much ºf
in the way that Pip, terrorised, ſº
assisted the fugitive in the
marshes who asked him, “You
know what wittles is ?” The
Baron unhesitatingly commends
and recommends this work of
Mrs. Boyd's.

AUSTRIA is preparing an armed demon-
stration against Turkey, and the Turks,
who dearly love a military display, are
said to be arranging for special excur-
sion trains to go and see it.
We are sorry to hear it rumoured
that there is trouble between Sir HENRY
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN and . Mr. John
MoRLEY. Mr. John MoRLEY has declared
that, if the arrangement negotiated
between Lord LANsdowne and the French
Republic should prove to be a satisfac-
tory one, no party feeling would prevent
him from saying that he regarded it as
a blessing.
It is denied that there is to be an
Arbitration Treaty between England
and Germany. Mutual love and respect
render this unnecessary.
It was announced the other day that
the troops at Port Arthur were in
excellent spirits, but General Stoessel
has now issued an order closing all the
public-houses in that place.
The Lord Mayor of LoNDON is said to
have received a letter of thanks from
John TRUNDLEY, of Peckham, for the
widening of London Bridge.
A lady tobacconist who recently
figured in a breach-of-promise case is
now advertising “Try our Breach-of-
Promise Cigars.” A Breach-of-Promise
cigar is, however, scarcely a new idea.
We have often purchased a cigar which
promised to be a genuine Havana.
Some charming new fashions in
mourning apparel for ladies have again
made their appearance, and we agree
with the fair writer who declares that
grief must be peculiarly deep which
cannot be assuaged by a chic black
canvas gown adorned with black taffetas
in the form of bands and a broad
corselet belt, and finished with a cas-
cade of lace down the backs of the
sleeves.
There is little doubt, in fact, that quite
the prettiest fancies are now to be found
in robes de deuil, and hard, indeed, is
the lot of those who are not qualified to
wear black. The smiling face of the
lady who has recently suffered a bereave-
ment, as it peeps forth from under a
smart mourning hat, meets with many
an envious glance from those who are
less fortunate.

CONFESSIONAL.
(Being the admissions of a Radical M.P. during his Easter retreat
on the Riviera.) -
Now drop the mask and lay aside the mummery,
And under Monte Carlo's brazen sky
Over the mutual Chambertin or Pommery
Let augur wink at augur, eye to eye.
Let us for once be frank and tell each other
We do not care one continental blow
Whether the man we call our yellow brother
Is doomed to be a brutish slave or no.
Let us allow that all this fiscal foment,
This stir about the general stomach's weal,
Never involved, for one unguarded moment,
More than a merely academic zeal.
e
Let us confess to certain pleasing fictions—
The “fight for Truth,” the “single-hearted aim"—
And own our “deepest, holiest convictions”
To be but catchwords in the party game.
For here our conscience needs no further blunting;
Here such impediments are lightly shed;
Here we improve the halcyon hour in punting
Upon the even chances—black or red.
A little while (ah! never, never, tell it
In Nonconformist Gath) our souls are free
To prance at will as yonder playful pellet
Prances without consulting you or me.
Then pluck the golden day before its glamour,
Brief as an Easter egg's, is due to wane;
Before the restive pit renews its clamour
And the old solemn farce begins again. O. S.
“AUS EINER KLEINEN GARNISON."
THE critics of Lieutenant Bilse's tedious book seem to have
overlooked his description of London in the last chapter.
Probably few readers got so far. We English cannot judge
of the truth of his accusations against the German army, but
we can test the accuracy of his observation by his picture of
London. -
It is, says he, past eight o'clock on a December evening.
The shops are being shut. So far we are in entire agreement
with him. But in the next paragraph he has crowds of
people hastening along the asphalte. Where are the asphalte
footways of London 2 However, let that pass, like the crowd.
From his description of some of the pedestrians, it may be
assumed that he is thinking of Regent Street or Hºi.
He writes, in German, of “Cabs und Omnibusse,” which are
certainly frequent in those thoroughfares, conveying elegant
loving couples, veiled ladies, Börsembarome (how does one
recognise the Barons of the Stock Exchange?), great
merchants, travellers, and so forth. But surely at 8 P.M. the
Börsembarone of London would be on the point of dining
sumptuously, though their counterparts in Berlin or Frank-
fort might then be hastening home to wash down their Abend-
essen with that champagne which, according to Herr Bilse,
flows so freely among the military. But let them also pass.
No sooner have we left the belated and starving Börsen-
barone than we are startled by the sound of tramway bells
among the quite German “elegante Coupés.” But where,
dear Mr. Bilse, are the tramways in Piccadilly, unless in a
sort of Pººl. vision vainly dreamed by the County
Council 2 ere is asphalte in Holborn, there are tramways
perhaps within hearing, but what Stock Exchange Baron
would go without his dinner and spend the evening in
driving in his elegant brougham up and down Holborn ?
We have in London what Herr Bilse rightly calls a
Grossstadtstrassenleben, but somehow we do not seem to
recognise it from his very careful description.
When finally his runaway couple, entering an unpretending
lodging-house, pass the Portier in his little room, we are
swept in imagination right away from London, and are
certainly in Germany or Austria. Even the last piece of
local colour, the interment of the murdered woman, and the
suicide in a burial ground, “far out on the banks of the
Thames,” leaves us still unconvinced and inquiring where
that riverside cemetery may be.
TO TATTERS.
No ordinary kind of dog was he,
No thoroughbred of spotless pedi ;
He was in fact that motley kind of hound,
Sometimes preserved, but usually drowned,
Wherein the more specific breeds contend
To form a base unutterable blend.
Briefly he was a frank offence to Art,
Yet when he died it nearly broke my heart!
There are proud beasts who live luxurious days,
Feeding off pheasant bones and mayonnaise;
With velvet coats and baskets lined with satin
To grow bad-tempered and extremely fat in,
Succumbing after lives of bestial ease
To apoplectic fits or Bright's disease.
Not such an one was poor neglected Tatters; he
Was rescued from the Lost Dogs' Home in Battersea
By one whose blighted heart concealed a deep
Yearning for something lovable but cheap.
I led him home, and ever as I went
Men eyed his shape with inward merriment,
Or stayed their hurrying footsteps to engage
In vulgar strictures on his parentage.
I led him home and watched his pensive smile
Digesting bones, and thus I mused the while :
“Alas!” I said (addressing the deceased),
“Ill-favoured, outcast, miserable beast,
I too am poor; together let us sup
From Penury's unappetising cup.
I too from Pleasure's paths am held aloof
(By a provoking paucity of oof);
I too through life have found, no less than you,
That kicks are plentiful and halfpence few.
You may have talents that the fancier's eye
Persistently refuses to descry;
And I've a turn for letters which I find
Ever eludes the editorial mind.
Each, too, beneath a crude exterior case,
Conceals a mind replete with every grace,
But which, for reasons not profoundly clear,
Still wastes its sweetness on the atmosphere.
Come, faithful hound (I said), and with me share
My somewhat plain but strictly wholesome fare.”
He came with pleasure, and until the end
Remained a true and inexpensive friend.
But now no more he'll gambol free from cares,
And bite the butcher's hireling unawares;
No more incur the vile bull terrier's spleen or
Resent the pampered pug dog's pert demeanour;
No more shall ill-bred youths his pride assail
And tie tin cans to his protesting tail.
Therefore the world seems Cark again, for lie
Is gone, and oh, the difference to me!

SCIENTIFIC SKIPPING.
THE Times has briefly called attention
to a pamphlet by Dr. Bond, of Gloucester,
advocating the employment of skipping
as an “unsurpassed form of home gym-
mastics,” and the use of his specially
devised skipping-rope, called “Girbola,”
which is intended to facilitate skipping
by adults. Mr. Punch is fortunately
enabled to supplement the Times notice
by testimonials from various eminent
sufferers who have derived benefit from
the new invention: –
DEAR Doctor, – After fifty years of
agonising immobility, I was persuaded
by the perusal of your fascinating
pamphlet to give your system a trial.
Taking the apparatus on my arm I
sallied forth into Kensington Gardens
and “girboled ” down the Broad Walk.
The effect, not only on myself but upon
the onlookers, was nothing short of
magical. The enthusiasm of the popu-
lace literally knew no bounds, and I
was escorted back to my house by a
veritable cavalcade of corybantic ad-
mirers. The Education Act, as Lord
RoseBERY said, is already doomed, but
passive resistance, reinforced by the
skipping-rope, is hastening its downfall
by leaps and bounds. Very faithfully
yours, John PAGE HoPPs.
DEAR SIR,-- After trying ski-ing,
motoring, tobogganing, and looping-the-
loop, I have come to the conclusion that
“Girbola” simply bangs the whole
blooming lot. Ever sincerely,
RUDYARD SkiPLING.
DEAR SIR,-Your invention has made
a New Woman of me. Formerly I could
barely wade through ten º of one of
§§
EoRGE MEREDITH's novels in a fort-
night. Now, with the aid of “Girbola,”
I am finishing his books at the rate of
one a day. (Lady) AGRIPPA HASKELL.
DEAR SIR,-Before using “Girbola"
my dog was a mastiff. He has now,
thanks to your invaluable system, de-
veloped into a perfect Schipperke.
Gratefully yours,
BEATRICE BARBICAN.
DEAR SIR,-Kent has long been known
as the Hop County. In recognition of
your splendid invention I venture to
suggest that Gloucester should hence-
forth be known as the Skip Shire.
Yours humbly, MoTHER SKIPTON.
Sir Thomas Lipton wires:—“Please
send me a ‘Girbola' at once. I want
to try it on the Skipper of Shamrock IV.”
Why have St. Vitus's Dance? By a
judicious blend of Girbola and the
Cake Walk, this remarkable distinction,
the despair of so many mental scientists,
can be cheerfully dispensed with by
persons of limited incomes.—[ADvT.]

warranted perfectly free from all Wit, Humour, and other extraneous

No. I.--THE SCHOOL For SCANDAL.
SCENE 1.-A Morning-room in the PETER TEAZLE's Maisonette.
Sir PETER and Lady T. discovered quarrelling.
Sir Peter. I don't want to have any words over it, Lady
TEAzLE,--but I must say that the bills you have been running
up are something cruel! It isn't as if you'd been brought
up to luxury. Before I married you, you were living in a
very poor way—no class at all!
Lady Teazle. Well, I'm sure, Sir PETER, and why should I
have married a stuffy old josser like you, three times my age,
except for his oof? I like to cut a dash and do things in
style—and you can't do that on the cheap!
Sir P. Now just you take it from me.

Lady T. (with hauteur). I hear you, Sir PETER, and, not
being wishful to demean myself by having a vulgar row over
trifles, I shall now leave the apartment. [Erit, with dignity.
Sir P. (to himself). We lead a cat-and-dog life together—
and yet, after all, there's a something about the girl that—
(Enter Sir OLIVER SURFACE). What, my old pal, Sir OLIVER!
Why, I thought you were at Calcutta.
Sir Oliver. So I was. But I’ve come over unbeknown, to
test the dispositions of my two nephews, Joseph and CHARLEs.
As they have never beheld my old dial they are not likely to
recognise my identity.
Sir P. Well, Joseph is all right—as moral as they make
'em ; but as for CHARLEs—oh lor! he is a hot 'un, and no
mistake! Up to his ears in debt, and—but soft! unless I'm
mistaken, I hear his voice in the passage.
Sir 0. He must not spot me as his Uncle OLIVER, Intro-
duce me as a moneylender—Mr. PETER PREMIUM.
Charles Surface (enters). Hullo—'ullo! How goes it, Sir
PETER 2 Who's this old geeser?
Sir P. This gentleman, CHARLEs, is Mr. PETER PREMIUM, a
moneylender.
Charles. Good biz! Just the party I was looking out for.
Mr. PREMIUM, can you oblige me with a temporary advance?
Sorry to say I've no security left to offer you—except the
family portraits.
Sir 0. The family portraits! (Aside). The young waster!
(Aloud) Surely you wouldn't part with them?
Charles. You can have the whole boiling for three hundred
uid—that is, except the likeness of my Uncle NoLL. The
old bird's always done the handsome by me, so I shall stick
to his picture.
Sir O. (aside). He has a feeling heart after all! But I will
test him further. (Aloud) As it happens, that is just the
portrait I want most. I'll give you another three hundred
for your Uncle Noll. Is it a deal?
Charles. Not much ! Put up your dirty splosh; little

Well, well, here is the three hundred for the others.

written to me for assistance—an old chum of Uncle Oliver's
who is down on his luck. I promised I'd give him a leg
over. [Eacit, whistling.

young chap CHARLEs is. Parts with everything he has

Mr. STANLEY.

you know one another.
Sir 0. I am an old friend of your Uncle Oliver's, Sir, and,
being unfortunately stoney-broke at present, I should take
it very kind if you could see your way to assisting me with
a trifle till the i. turns.
Joseph. Believe me, my dear Sir, I would willingly do so
if I could. But, alas! I haven't a stiver to spare!
Sir 0. Why, I thought your rich Uncle OLIVER supplied
you with—?
Joseph. Uncle Oliver ! Oh dear no. He's very near.
Why, he never sent me anything in his life—except one of
those nests of painted boxes which you can buy for a bob in
Oxford Street !
Sir O. (aside). And I’ve allowed this beauty five hundred
a year ! (Aloud) Ah, I wasn't aware of that.
Joseph. No, of course not—but it's a fact. All I can do
is to put in a word for you with my Uncle, if I get the
chance, and I'll promise that with all the pleasure in life.
Sir 0. That's uncommonly good of you! Sir PETER, a
word with you in private. [Exit with Sir P.
Joseph (alone, to himself). That's the worst of being a
good young man. Everybody expects you to help them. I
am up a bit of a stick. I am really courting MARIA, who is
an heiress and Sir PETER's ward—but I have, somehow, got
into a serious flirtation with Lady TEAzIE. Here comes MARIA.
—No, it's Lady T. (Enter Lady TEAZLE.) I called to try if I
couldn't get you to come and see my library this afternoon.
Lady T. What, alone? But shall I not be compromising
my reputation ?
Joseph. Not you! Don't you run away with any such
idea. My reputation's good enough for two any day.
Lady T. In that case, perhaps, I may risk it. [Eacit R.

HOL | DAY HINTS.
(By the Expert Wrinkler.)
WHERE to spend Saturday to Monday
is, of course, the prevailing and stub-
born problem in many of the stately
homes of England. What then must
be the difficulty when the question to be
answered is where to spend the Easter
holidays? The reply depends, of course,
very much upon the time that can be
expended upon the vacation. If, to
take an example, a gentleman has only
a week at his disposal, it is little use his
thinking very seriously of India or the
Cape; but Paris is, of course, well
within his power. Given a fortnight
he might get as far as Rome if he
wished to, although for my part I prefer
Monte. On this favourite resort, how-
ever, I need not dwell at present, as my
readers will remember a paragraph on
Monte and suitable costume there which
I wrote some two or three years ago on
the occasion of one of the infrequent
breakings of the bank.
The IDEAL EQUIPMENT.
Any gentleman who really wishes to
acquire a reputation as a citizen of the
world must be supplied with a large
number of travelling outfits which he
can pack at a moment's notice. A com-
pendious bag fitted with requirements
for the moors is always handy under my
bed; and I am ; to start for the
Riviera, the Normandy coast, Paris,
Switzerland, the Bavarian Alps, the
Rhine, Norway, Palestine, Iceland, at
ten minutes notice, according as the
invitation may be worded. No gentle-
man at all in demand can afford to
dispense with such preparations. But
to make travel really pleasant, remember
that you must not only do in Rome as
Rome does, but you must dress as Rome
(or Paris) expects you to.
The NEEDs of PARIs.
Paris being the favourite Easter resort
I cannot do better, even at the risk of
repeating myself, than give a few hints
as to costume in the gay city. A
strong light suit of tweed dittoes, of a
pronounced check pattern, should be
the basis of one's wardrobe. By way of
headgear a deer-stalker, a cloth, or best
of all, a pith helmet, is de rigueur in
the English visitor, and if you are not
provided by Nature with side-whiskers
and long projecting front teeth, you
must call in the resources cf art to make
good these deficiencies.
A SENSIBLE Swiss OUTFIT.
For a Swiss tour I should recommend
the following outfit. A dome-shaped
celluloid hat for resisting the impact of
avalanches: two climbing suits of stout
Welsh homespun or Irish frieze (do not
make the mistake of wounding the
susceptibilities of the local fauna by
choosing chamois-leather, otherwise an
excellent substance); hot-water tube
puttees and porpoise-hide brogues. A
good supply of alpenstocks and blue
veils is indispensable. For hotel life
I recommend tourists to take their own
mosquito curtains, a pianola, and a
portable swimming-bath. The changes
of temperature in Switzerland are so
sudden that one must be prepared for
every emergency. If the noontide glare
has to be faced, bombazine bloomers will
be found most refreshing. But if the
Matterhorn is to be .# by moonlight
you cannot be too warmly clad.
NATIONAL Costume.
What I would impress on any intend-
ing traveller, then, is to be prepared
within certain limits to accommodate
his dress to that of the country he
proposes to visit. It is quite a mistake
to suppose that this will involve an
serious outlay. Foreigners, º
sensitive, are considerate, and will not
expect strangers to adopt every detail of
their national costume. For instance,
I have found that the alterations needful
for a visit to Vienna are very few indeed.
The absolute minimum is a butterfly tie,
but I should also recommend a bottle of
pommade Hongroise and a tall hat with
a flat brim. The ordinary brim can be
made to lie flat with a little coaxing, and
can be curled up afterwards by any
good hatter. High heels also create a
favourable impression on the foreign
mind, and if you take a black coat be
sure that it is heavily braided.
The TYROL AND ITALY.
I knew a man who said that you
would be welcomed anywhere in the
Tyrol if you could only jodel. Per-
sonally, though I think that a little
tul-lul-liety' may be a passport to the
affections of the Tyrolese peasant, it has
no influence whatever with hotel-keepers.
For Italy a velvet or velveteen coat will
make you feel at home, and if this
should prove beyond the resources of
your purse then I strongly recommend
earrings as the irreducible minimum.
The preliminary operation, I admit, is a
little painful, but it soon passes off.
Earrings, with a red Garibaldi shirt and
a Byron tie, give a man a very stylish
and ºf. peninsular appearance.
ANswers to CoRRESPONDENTs.
BEAU BRUMMEL (Bucks). —(1) I should
recommend your using a patent safety
razor; (2) If your man cannot tie your
white ties satisfactorily, I should buy
them already made-up.

“THINGS SEEN.”
(With apologies to the fortunate observers
of the “Daily Chronicle.”)
PERIL.
THE Kohinoor with urgent paddles
forced her implacable insistent way
towards Margate. The sea basked in
opalescent beauty implicit with repose.
We were nearing our destination rapidly;
the friendly pier even now beaconed in the
offing, when an arresting thing hap-
pened. Far on the horizon a huge
steamer loomed, making, as it seemed,
straight for our teeming craft.
The suspense was terrible. Would
she run us down? Everv minute
brought her nearer: she could not be
more than a mile away. Would our
helmsman be equal to the occasion?
On every side I saw the bright eyes of
danger, as STEVENSON calls them. Women,
lately so vocal, were still; strong men
laid aside their pipes. The Captain,
stern and white, implicit with deter-
mination, gripped the rail of the bridge.
Thus pas the minutes until the
two vessels were broadside, the other
about a quarter of a mile to port, and
a great outstanding shout of relief went
up from every throat.
At that moment my eye chanced on a
leaflet which had been dropped by some
proselytising tripper. It was entitled,
“In the midst of life we are in death.”
I shuddered as I thought of the escape,
and immediately afterwards was giving
a penny to a member of a minstrel
troupe. Such is life, a mingled yarn.
SPEED.
It was the last 'bus. With the lights
of home before him the driver ii on
the lash with a will, and away we sped,
like the wind. In the exaltation of that
delirious pace I lifted my voice and sang
loud and lustily. A phrase of Whit-
MAN's had been obsessing me all day
with dull insistence, and I sang it now:
There is no stoppage and never can besto -
If I, you, ..º.º. and all i.º:
upon their surfaces, were this moment
reduced to a pallid ghost, it would not
avail in the long run,
We should surely bring up again where we
now stand,
And surely go as much farther, and farther,
and farther.
On we went, on and on, past houses
and lamp-posts and policemen, and all
the while I sang, oblivious to all save
the arresting rapture of flight.
At length I was interrupted by a

hand on my shoulder and a voice saying,
“Now, then, Guvnor, when you've quite
done. Can't have all this row going on
in the yard.” I glanced round. We
were truly in the yard, and the horses
were already in their stalls. I could
hear the sound of their insistent
vegetarian munching.
Sadly I retraced the mile to my
lodgings. As I did so I stumbled over
a book carelessly dropped by a passer-
by. It was STEVENSON's Men and Books.
The page fell open at the essay on
WHITMAN, and I read in the sickly light
of the gas, “No singer, it is true, this
brave WALT: but there are better things
than song.”
KNowLEDGE.
The large dining-hall was full. It
buzzed with badinage and good fellow-
ship. Around me sat all that was best
in public life, literature and art—met
together to the glory of that old Persian
poet who left us this rich and ruddy
credo. Here was a critic whose lightest
word means fame or despair to a thou-
sand authors; there a poet whose mere
name sets every heart athrob with ex-
pectant ecstasy. Next me was a novelist
to whom the human soul has no secrets.
Philosophers, playwrights, humourists,
publicists, sat side by side, made one
by, the federating powers of wit and
| devotion. London had surpassed even
her brilliant outstanding self.
Suddenly some one propounded a
simple problem—“How many parts of
speech are there?” Individual opinion
was asked. The question ran insistent
from guest to guest. “Four,” said one;
“five,” another; “thirty-nine,” a third
hazarded; and so on—all visibly uneasy.
No one knew for certain.
In the midst of this perplexity a
waiter chanced to pause behind my
chair—a slight pale youth who had
attended to me very badly. I put the
question to him.
“Nine,” he said.
Ah, mystery of human life, paradox
of learning! The race is not always to
the swift, nor the battle to the strong.
A Disciple.
Just as I turned into Holborn 1 per-
ceived the small eager compact insistent
crowd that indicates that a horse is
down. I peered over the heads of the
surging spectators at the supine friend
of man. It was a chestnut mare of some
thirtv summers.
“Yes, Sir,” said the policeman to
whom I put the usual question. “Yes,
Sir” (they always call me Sir, and I
never omit to say so). “Yes, Sir, it's a
horse down, sure enough. But as
EMERSON says, “We cannot always be on
our feet.’”
I grasped his hand : “You, too, know
the sweet Sage of Concord 2’”
“Know him?” said the policeman,
“blimy, Sir, he's beef and beer to me!”
A very young lady of Shoreham
Stole some clothes of her brother's and

But her family said,

[TomPKINs, having religiously read the leading articles and political
news, hunts through his newspaper for something interesting. He
hits on a likely looking paragraph.]
This sounds as if it should appeal to me;
I like to keep abreast of modern thought;
“A scientist's superb discovery !
New theory with vital interest fraught.”
I wonder what the new discovery is
Something of vast importance, I've no doubt;
It's marvellous what clever theories
These scientific men keep throwing out.
I'll wager now that one of these great guns
Has soared above earth's ... and strife,
Grappled with worlds, wrung truth from far-off suns,
And solved the deepest mysteries of life.
Unconquered, undeterred by space or time,
With balanced mind he sifted false from true,
And here, in language cogently sublime,
He gives the issue. Come! let's read it through.
“Man’s destiny is hidden in the stars”;
(That's a good phrase, by George! and comes out pat.)
“We get no help from Jupiter and Mars.”
(H'm, yes! That's so. I've often thought of that.)
“Pure scientific Truth must be our guide;
With her we search through Nature's wide domain.
What do we find? We see on every side
That man's inheritance is one of pain.”
(That's true. We've got to put up with a lot.)
“But shall his soul on that account despair?
Can Science labour vainly 2 May we not
Find means to lift the load he has to bear?
“At last a remedy is found,” (That's good!)
“A perfect anodyne for daily ills.
Would you be happy?” (Yes, of course I would.)

SPOILT CHILDREN.
[At a recent meeting of the London Court
of Common Council, Alderman Sir Thomas
BrookE-Hitching, speaking in support of a
motion to reduce the age limit for the employ-
ment of children, said he did not believe that
going to work early in life was deleterious to
a child. Some of England's greatest men had
begun life by going to work at six, seven, or
eight years of age, but nowadays children had
so much time to themselves that they acquired
lazy habits unless they were under control.]
You sentimental faddists say
That children ought to loaf away
In pampered ease each idle day
At least till their eleventh year;
You let them dawdle up the Tree
Of Knowledge, nor insist with me
That every infant ought to be
At work before its seventh year.
My aldermanic feelings boil
When I consider how you spoil
The brats who should be taught to toil:
You let them waste their golden time
And learn to gamble, smoke and bet,
Instead of teaching them to get
Their daily pap by honest sweat,
As infants did in olden time.
It maddens me—this wasteful rule
That children so mature should fool
Whole days away attending school
Where nothing they are taught to do,
But vain accomplishments they learn,
Which only serve their heads to turn
And make their fierce ambitions burn
Long, long before they ought to do.
When our great grandsires were alive,
Their sons at six or even five
Were sent to labour in the hive—-
The youngsters grew industrious,
And by the time that they were at
The age when any modern brat
Is only lazy, sleek and fat,
Already were illustrious.
No idle hours their life disgraced—
. . They did not cultivate a taste
For muddy oafishness, nor waste
Blue afternòons in cricketing;
From morn to night with pick and spade
They plied the collier's noble trade,
Or, if a strike were on, essayed
The manly art of picketing.
Thus exercised the livelong day,
In soul and body prospered they,
Nor prematurely fell a prey
To twelve-year-old senility;
But toiling ever, tools in hand,
They early came to understand
The dignity of labour and
The virtue of utility.
SCENE: Margate Beach on Easter Monday.
First Lady. O here comes a steamer.
How high she is out of the water.
Second Lady. Yes, dear, but don't yon

THE WIRE-PULLERS.
II.--THE ANTI-Tourists.
For months I had been vaguely
conscious of his existence. At almost
every turn in my journeyings on the
Continent I had met with petty annoy-
ances—small things in themselves, but
considerable in the aggregate. In Hol-
land, for instance, there was the absurd
monetary system. In Germany there
as the impossibility of getting any-
thing to eat more civilised than raw
ham. In Austria it was the ubiquity of
sham Tyrolese peasants. In Italy I
had to record the leading dates of my
life on my circular ticket. In France I
couldn't get my morning tub. There
was not the least doubt that some
directing influence was behind it all. I
could feel that there was at work some
powerful mind, whose owner eluded
line. -
So I set about catching him.
Italian railways seemed to offer the best
chance of success. I discovered an obscure
village which was about to be connected
by a new line with one of the main
tourist routes. I took up my residence
in the town from which the new line
branched, and waited till it was opened.
Then I bought a return ticket and
travelled by the first train that was run.
What I expected happened. The out-
ward journey was the perfection of
comfort. I stayed the night at the
village and returned the next day.
Again what I expected happened. Com-
fort had given place to chaos. The
influence was at work. I waited on the
platform and looked out for my man.
His self-satisfied air was unmistakable.
I cornered him outside the ticket barrier
and grasped his throat.
“You brute!” I gasped.

“Why do you do it?” I asked.
“Will you tell me if I stand you a bottle
of wine?”
“Not Italian wine,” he pleaded.
“French, then.”
“Very well,” he agreed, and we
repaired to a restaurant.
“You’ve given me a lot of trouble,”
he said wearily when he was comfortably
scated. “You see, you've been travelling
at the wrong time. This is not the
tourist season.”
“I prefer not to travel during the
tourist season.”
“Ah, really?

“I am here chiefly on business.”
“My dear Sir,” he exclaimed, “pray
accept my apologies. I misjudged you.
But that Gladstone bag of yours, and

pleasant it is.”
“Certainly,” I said, “but what exactly
do you conceive to be your duty?”
“Well, it's a secret, but the cat's
already half out of the bag, and—the
wine is really quite tolerable. Besides,
you're not a tourist.” He leaned forward
and whispered, “I am the agent of the
British Watering-place Trust. For some
ears the dividends of that excellent
y had been falling, and there was
a general feeling among shareholders
that the attractions of the Continent
were ruining the Home hotel and board-
ing-house industry. So the directors
met to consider ways and means, and
my appointment is the result. I am
commissioned to make Europe so un-
inviting to strangers that no one will care
to go there. I control a gigantic secret
service.”
I nodded.

“One branch of our work,” he went
on, “is the preparation of guide-books

path there. I should like to kill
BEDEKER. I believe I should have killed
him by this time if it hadn't been for
his ‘Manual of Conversation.' That has
practically saved his life. Have you
ever tried to use it?”
“Yes,” I said; “and it's like trying
to learn chess with a handbook. Your
opponent never will give the right reply
to your opening.”
“Exactly. ; reckon that the embar-
rassments occasioned by the use of that
Manual have cured enough tourists to
spoil Cook's fortune. Cook is another of
my pet aversions. I'm not at all sure that
his life is safe. It wouldn't be worth an
hour's purchase if I could get him into
Corsica. His ticket system is the despair
of my people. We rely very largely on
the difficulties connected with getting
tickets.

your name on them, and so on, is fairly
effective, but tourists don't mind that so
much when they haven't had the trouble
of buying them with foreign money in a
foreign language.”
“Where do you turn most of your
attention ?”
“Oh, to Italy. I've taken infinite
pains with Italy. With the railways
especially. Take an Crdinary case—the
journey from Florence to Pisa. If you
go by the time-table it takes two hours;
if you go by train it takes anything up
to five. Then you've probably noticed

religious light and the infernal discom-
º of the carriages. Well, it's all my
Olng.
“Then the Italian hotels. It would be
hard, I should say, to equal the pitch
of tameness to which I've trained the
mosquitoes. , You have only to extend
your naked hand and they'll come and
eat out of it.”
“It's true,” I groaned.
“But of course this is only a small
part of my work. I can't tell you every-
thing. There are the faked-up reports
of Alpine accidents; the waiters who
will talk to you in what they believe to
be your own tongue; German pastry;
the disfigurement of landscapes and old
ruins with restaurants; and, above all,
the Continental Bradshaw—”
“Yes, yes,” I interrupted. “Don’t open
old wounds. I'm glad to have met you,
very glad you've told me all this, par-
ticularly glad you didn't bind me to
secrecy.”
“You’ll publish it?” he asked.
“Undoubtedly.”
“Well,” he said, confidently, “do
your worst. I shall take a lot of
beating.”

O SATYR, when I saw you first
Ranging the roof with fourfold grip,
You (being, so to speak, reversed)
Betrayed no sign of cousinship.
I never liked the thought, and 1
Was glad to put the matter by.
But when you stood erect of frame,
And stiffly crossed the level stones,
I could no more dispute your claim
Of kinship to my old friend, Joxes;
His very gait, his very build !
I'm glad I wasn't left undrilled.
And when I gained a closer view,
Your features, as I gazed thereon,
Betrayed a marked resemblance to
| My more than brother, Robinsox,
Which did imply a common race;
I'm glad I haven't got that face.
But, more than all, your ginger beard,
The rusty carrots on your crown,
Gave you a ludicrously weird
Similitude to dear old BRowN. ;
Old BRowN and you would make a pair!
I'm glad I haven't got red hair.

HOW NEWSPAPERS INFLUENCE
THE PUBLIC.
[Mr. John BURNs, in the debate on the County
Council Tramways Bill, stated that all the young
men who fought with women for seats on the
Westminster buses were readers of the Daily
Mail.]
Mr. Punch's special inquisitor has gone
round to procure accurate information as
to the way in which newspapers influence
their readers. This is the result.
. The head porter of the Alhambra,
when questioned, said that if he saw a
gentleman seated in the stalls reading
the Spectator he knew as if by intuition
that that gentleman would have to be
chucked out in the course of the evening.
“Gets to their 'eads like champagne,”
observed the stalwart critic.
A railway guard remarked that if a
gentleman objected to others smoking
in a smoking compartment that gentle-
man always had a copy of the Daily
News with him. He had no positive
theory on the subject, but thought that
there might be something about the
Daily News printers' ink which made
tobacco smoke objectionable. He had
also noticed that ladies reading Home
Chat frequently left their babies behind
in the carriages, and thought that this
was a testimony to the enthralling
qualities of the paper. Ladies who read
M.A.P. were invariably most courteous to
railway servants. He attributed this to
the fact that they strove to imitate the
genial aristocrats described in its pages.
A detective inspector at Scotland Yard
said that criminals as a rule were in-

had been brought to the hospital clutch-
ing copies of the Athenaeum. He
invariably cured them by the “red

expeditiously applied by swathing the
patient from head to foot in copies of
the Sporting Times.
A real lady, who condescendingly
presides at a railway refreshment bar,
observed that if on entering the field
he saw any section of the onlookers read-
ing the Rock he regarded it as a very
evil omen. He had always found that
in such a case he was ultimately stoned
out of the ground.
A Hooligan stated that it was exceed-
ingly unwise to garrote any wayfarer

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
A story whereof the principal scenes are placed in South
Africa among the Boers is not at first sight calculated to
attract the English reader; but whoever on this account
dismisses The Shulamite, written by ALICE and CLAUDE AsKEw,
CHAPMAN AND HALL being the publishers thereof, without
giving more than a cursory glance at this book, will be doing
the authors an injustice, and will be depriving himself or
herself of a very great pleasure. The situations of the tale
are powerfully dramatic, the characters are all clearly defined,
and the interest of the reader, through all the changing
scenes of their life, in sorrow or in joy (“for which overhaul
hymn book, and when found make a note of ” – Cuttle),
is never allowed to flag for one single moment. The type
of Boer here represented belongs, as it seems, to the
well-to-do, but rough, untutored, illiterate, farming class,
and not to the superior breed whose young men become
graduates at Oxford and Cambridge, and whose young
women receive their education in Paris. The authors
evidently set themselves a task, and have unflinchingly
carried it out to the bitter end; yet, from time to time, as
the web is being woven, the Baron fancies he can hear
. Mistress ALICE AsKEw pleading that some little consideration
may be shown to the hardly-pressed lover, while, on the other
hand, CLAUDE AsKEw has shown himself willing to yield to his
partner's prayer on the sole condition of her extending some
pity to the cruelly-used Shulamite. Neither would give way,
and the result is the successful achievement of the uncon-
ventional.
Mr. WALTER SICHEL's Disraeli (METHUEN) will not fill the
place in biography for which Lord Rowton's unbegun book
was sought. He did not know his subject personally, nor has
he access to sources of private information usually supplied
to the authorised biographer. He is dependent for the value
of his book chiefly upon the talent of industry which led
him to diligent search through the published records of
DisrAELI's work, whether on the platform, in the press, or in
literature. The result would be more attractive if he had
been able to resist a fatal tendency to italics. There is
nothing more disturbing to a reader than to come upon a
passage in a page printed in italics. Mr. SICHEL peppers
nearly every page of his portly volume with this offence.
Another trick annoying by its iteration is the assurance that
he will show us something in “my eighth chapter” or “my
tenth.” These are blemishes on an industrious and inform-
ing compilation easily removed should it reach a second
edition.

My Nautical Retainer offers hearty congratulations to
those two clever sisters, K. and L. Montgomery, on the
success of The Cardinal's Pawn, their remarkable contribution
to UNwiN’s “First Novel Series.” What faults it has are
due to a too prolific gift for imagery, and to an overlaboured
style that tends to obscurity-defects that may perhaps be
ascribed to excess of virtue. Possibly the infection was
caught from the pedantry of that Medicean period in which
the plot is laid, and from the influence of a land “where the
richness runs to flowers.” The authors have so far disregarded
their own identity that they have forgotten that the narrative
itself should have been told in the simple diction of to-day,
and not according to the recondite and allusive methods of
mediaeval Italy. But this is the kind of fault that the future
will easily cure, if, as THACKERAY says, “we grow simpler as we
grow older.” Meanwhile, K. L. Montgomery (as the authors
combine to call themselves) has really no need to claim the
indulgence allowed to inexperience. Whether the scene is
laid in Florence where the board was set, or in Venice that
saw so many breathless checks and counterchecks, or in the
wide spaces of forest and hill that lie between, there is no
page in this enthralling book but glows with colour and is
alive with the stir of adventure. Indeed the book should
be read twice; first, for pure joy of the tale itself, which
betrays a marvellously vivid invention; and next, for the
better understanding of those high qualities of artistic
feeling and observation that have been lavished on the rich
embroidery of the backgrounds.
Mrs. ALEC Tweedie's Behind the Footlights (Hutchisson &
Co.) will amuse and interest many besides those who may be
curious to learn in what respect actors, actresses, and other
persons connected professionally with the drama and music
differ from ordinary human beings. “Glitter,” observes Mrs.
Tweedle, “dazzles the eye.” So it does: true; it couldn't
well dazzle the nose, but that's a mere detail of only slight
importance. “Nevertheless,” she continues, “behind it"-
i.e., the glitter, not the eye—“beat good hearts and true:"
(Hear, hear!) “while hard work, patient endurance, and
courage mark the path of the successful player.” In this
respect the path of “the successful player” is, you see, not
very different from that of “the successful player” at cricket,
or billiards, or of “the successful” lawyer, stock-broker, com-
poser, doctor, statesman, or general store-dealer. The book
is illustrated with some excellent photographs of celebrities.

HERE, where the jewelled waters lie
Locked in a curve of sheltering shore,
Sapphire that answers rock and sky,
Turquoise above the grey sea-floor,
Lulled by a cool narcotic breeze
That shrinks to break the tideless calm,
This Slave of Duty lolls at ease
Imbibing Nature's healthy balm.
The landward ridges, plumed with green,
Stand sentinel to guard my scalp
Lest any airs too rudely keen
Should blow from some adjacent Alp;
Likewise my soul, by that device
As in a haven, closely furled,
Breathes an exclusive Paradise
Whose gates defy a fevered world.
Yet are my senses well aware
That just a league of coast between
Divides me from the fret and glare
Of Monte Carlo's giddy scene;
And, doubtless, in her stolid way,
However much my help is missed,
England herself, this Easter Day,
Somehow continues to exist.
My heaven is changed, but not my heart,
Which still is hers in any clime,
Nor would I let exotic art
Colour my purely British rhyme;
And, as I tune my homing song,
One face, one form, in Memory's van,
Command my larynx; they belong
To HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN.
In lively gratitude I reach
Back to the monumental date
On which he read his studied speech
Against the War-Triumvirate;
When that old warrior burst in scorn
Upon the one redemptive scheme
Spared from the wreck of hopes forlorn
That marked a moribund régime.
What sort of praise from Liberal ranks
That bright heroic deed may earn
I know not, but I know the thanks
That in a Tory bosom burn!
So round his feet may pansies blow,
And sunlight gild his genial face
Whose tact allowed a tottering foe
At least another year of grace!

|you must admit, Sir, if ever there was one.
M. BOUDIN IN ENGLAND.
No. I.
MY DEAR SIR,--I am sure you will not deny that we are
living in critical times. It was only last week that, happen-
ing, as I sometimes do, to lunch at the Xerxes (my favourite
Club), I came across my old friend AUBERON, and found that
he took a very gloomy view of public affairs. AUBERON, by
the way—this is entirely between you and me—used in his
early days to be an Irishman, but soon after he came to
England he chucked it, if I may quote from The Second in
Command, and at the same time he changed his somewhat
full-flavoured Hibernian name of O'BRIEN to the compara-
tively Norman name under which he used to sit in the
House of Commons and still writes letters to the Times.
You remember his last one, I daresay. It was, as an under-
graduate acquaintance of mine would say, a regular teaser,
and had as its title “PRINCIPLE or PARTY-which 2’’ It went
on for a column and a quarter, and it showed that, while
Mr. BALFOUR and Mr. BRODRICK and the rest of them were
almost absurd in their incompetence, Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-
BANNERMAN and Mr. ASQUITH were much worse, being
afflicted with what the writer in one of his finest passages
called “a positive megalomania for the worst results of a
barren Little Englandism, which has led them from one
humiliation to another until their last state has become even
worse than their first, though, no doubt,” continued AUBERON,
“it is infinitely superior to that condition to which they are
tending—I mean the sea which lies at the bottom of a certain
steep place of which we have all heard.” This, I may say,
is a good and typical example of AUBERON's style. He him-
self calls it persiflage, and I've no doubt it must be in-
tensely galling to those who are made its victims. I saw
Mr. Asquith and Sir HENRY C.-B. on the very day this letter
appeared, and I couldn't help noticing that, in spite of an
affected ease and carelessness of demeanour, there was some-
thing alarmed and furtive about their looks, something
penitential and appealing in their way of walking and
talking, which plainly showed that the Auberonian shafts of
satire had gone home, as, indeed, nobody could doubt they
would.
On the occasion of my meeting AUBERON at lunch at the
Xerxes last week, I had brought with me a young French-
man who is making a short stay in this country with the
object of studying our institutions and learning, I suppose,
how we have managed to establish ourselves in a position
which excites the jealousy of all foreign nations. His name
is Boudin, JEAN JACQUES IE AUGUSTE Boudin, a queer name,
Often have I
asked myself in reading these and similar assortments of
French names why a man should think it necessary to have
a female name in addition to his other male names. Nobody
would object to JEAN or to JACQUEs, or even to AUGUSTE
(though I own that John and JAMEs and AUGUSTUs have a
stronger and more resolute sound), but why MARIE * I said
something of this sort—of course, as delicately and politely
as possible—to Boudin, but he merely smiled and asked me
not to make him responsible for the failings of his parents.
At the time I did not press the matter, but obviously this
answer only shifts the matter one step back: it supplies no
reason for a custom which is as absurd as it is unmanly.
However, Boudin himself, whatever may be said about his
names, is presentable enough. His age is twenty-six, he
stands at least six feet high, his complexion is ruddy, his
moustache is as good, though not quite so long, as that of
Sir Robert HERMON-Hodge (which } have always held to be
the fine fleur of British-grown moustaches), and his clothes
are excellent both in cut and in taste. He can ride and he
can shoot (at least he says he can), he has taken part, so he
tells me, in the athletic revival of France and has played

football (of a sort, naturally), and has
rowed in a race. Intending sooner or
later to launch himself in public life he
has come over here, as I said, to learn
what he can about freedom, progress,
and Parliamentary methods. He brought
a letter of introduction to me and I
brought him to the Xerxes Club to
lunch and we met AUBERON.
Now it was, perhaps, unfortunate that
we should thus have come upon AUBERON,
for AUBERON, eminent and considerable
as he is, has, if I may hint it, one fault:
he is, haying snapped the links that
bound him to Ireland and the Celts, the
John Bulliest Briton that ever ate a
chop and drank bitter beer at the Xerxes,
than which there is no John Bullier club
in London or the provinces of England,
including Putney and Sevenoaks. “Ah,
me boy,” said he, as I approached—the
odour of Irish roses still clings to his
treacherous tongue—“you've read my
letter in the Times? Well, am I right?
Was there ever a Government like this?
Faith, they'll be giving Middlesex to
Russia next.”
“What,” I asked in some disturbance,
for I trust I am not unpatriotic, and it
galled me to hear our Government thus
spoken of in the presenceof Boudin, “what
has happened? I have not noticed—”
“Hear him!'” says AUBERON, “hear
him D'ye not see they're patching up
an agreement with France on all out-
standing questions—that's what they
call it when they mean to abandon the
interests of the country. Is it we should
be making any agreement with France?
Isn't it France, our bitter enemy”—
here I winked violently at him, but all
to no purpose—“isn't it France should
be crawling on her knees to us, begging
us to make an agreement wid her”—
his excitement overcame him, but he
proceeded—“And what's the use of it
any way? France has got a falling
birth-rate and there's no trust to be
placed in her. She's only waiting to
be grabbed by a dictator, and then see
if I’m not right. She’ll invade us, by
the powers, and where'll your twopenny-
halfpenny Government be then?” There
was more to the same effect, but I
hastily withdrew Boudin from the dread-
ful scene, and we sat down together
at a remote table.
Evidently, however, we are living, as
I said, in critical times, and, such being
the case, it may interest you to hear
from time to time what my young French
friend thinks of our civilisation and how
he is struck by our greatness. So far he
has been very reticent.
Faithfully yours, X.

There's nothing like drinking
For putting some heart in a man;
For any sake, do not give way!
I hope with this craving you'll grapple;
The clouds will roll by
If you only will try
The effect of consuming an apple.
If a desperate deed should invite,
If you fear you are going insane,
If you feel suicidal

Munch a Newtown with leisurely bite,
And ponder the deed you intended:
I am soundly assured
You will find yourself cured

(in the Chair).
Archdeacon Sinclair.
Canon Hemsley Henson.
Mr. Frederic Harrison.
Mr. William Archer. "
Mr. G. K. Chesterton.
Mr. Beerbohm Tree.
Mr. C. B. Fry.
Editor of the “Daily News.” This
meeting has been convened, gentlemen,
in order to arrive at some satisfactor
replies to a set of four questions .
I have drawn up :-
A. Have you found outdoor exercise to be neces-
sary?
B. What is the particular pastime favoured by
ou?
C. wº benefits have you personally derived
from such pastime?
D. What are the benefits likely to accrue to
the community from the encouragement
of athletics?
Certain replies to these questions have
already appeared in my columns, but it
seemed well to discuss the matter also
in convocation. I might open the
discussion by saying that, personally, I
could never do the work I do if it were
not for the game of water polo which I
play every afternoon after lunch at the
Bath Club.
Archdeacon Sinclair. Water polo may
be very well, but surely the ordinary
me with ponies is better and prettier.
i. young artisans in the large towns
would play polo instead of watching
football and cricket we should have a
finer national physique.
Canon Hensley Henson. Do you think
lo is better than "..."; the ball?
}"...ii. my own good health and
prosperity to an undeviating habit of
punching the ball, in and out of season.
Mr. G. K. Chesterton. All perfect exer-
cise is passive. The finest exercise in
the world, combining as it didi courage,
the preservation of one's balance, and
recognition of scientific progress, was to
be obtained from the moving staircase
at HARRod's Stores. Since that has been
removed I have grown steadily flaccid.
Mr. William Archer. SYDNEY SMITH, I
have read, used to recommend a walk on
an empty stomach.
Editor of the “Daily News.” Yes, but
in these indulgent gormandising days
where are we to find one?
Archdeacon Sinclair. There used to
be one—I forget where.
Canon Hemsley Henson. At the Royal
Aquarium, I think. A man named
Succi.
Mr. William Archer. Yes, that was
the name. He drew crowded houses.
Mr. Beerbohm Tree. I have reason to
believe that walking on all fours is a
most admirable means of building up
the physique. The chest measurement
of Zakkuri's spies, in The Darling of the
Gods, who progress entirely in this way,
has increased enormously since the first
night.
Archdeacon Sinclair. It does not sound
to me dignified.
Mr. Tree. Yet what is dignity com-
pared with the mens sana in corpore
sano 2
Archdeacon Sinclair. True. I must
practise it. Hitherto I have found that
there is nothing like walking to develop
the muscles of the leg. My motto is,
Always do things by calves. I skip
regularly every morning for some minutes
after my bath, and on specially busy
days I fortify myself by running round
the Whispering Gallery before the sacred
fane is open to the general public.
Canon Hemsley Henson. Does Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN hunt 2
Mr. Frederic Harrison. I think not.
It is his only redeeming virtue. But
then he goes to the opposite extreme-
that of taking no exercise—which is in
its way quite as bad as the excessive
indulgence in demoralising sports and
pastimes.
Mr. William Archer. I hope you do
not include dancing in that category.
As a perfervid Gael I cling passionately
to the exercises of my native heath.
Archdeacon Sinclair. The Highland
Fling is all very well. But would you
encourage the Cake-Walk?
Mr. Chesterton. Certainly, if it con-
duced to municipal patriotism.
Mr. William Archer. Not that I dance
to excess. I have other diversions. For
example, I make a point of vaulting
over every pillar-box after I have posted
an article in it. The act is a form of
worship, a testimony to the power of the
G.P.O., the Press, and incidentally of
myself.
Mr. Chesterton. I should have put
“myself” first.
ditor of the “Daily News.” But we
are rather losing sight of the last ques-
tion on our list, that lettered D.
Mr. Chesterton. Well, as to the benefits
likely to accrue to the community from
the encouragement to vault letter boxes,
much could be said and more written.
I could have a column on the subject
ready in ten minutes at the usual rates.
Mr. William Archer. I don’t think
you ought to take my subject.
Mr. Chesterton. Perhaps not; but all
subjects are one to me.
Mr. C. B. Fry. I am surprised that no
one has mentioned cricket. Surely there
is no exercise like that, both for the
muscles and the fountain pen. As to
its effect on the populace, it makes them
buy the best magazines, and what could
be better than that?
Canon Hensley Henson. Arethere any
best magazines now-a-days?
Mr. C. B. Fry. Why, haven't you seen
our advertisements 2 Awfully witty.
“It's A NEw MAGAZINE. It's A NEws
MAGAZINE. It's A NEWNES MAGAZINE.”
Archdeacon Sinclair. I say, who made
up that? That's wonderfully good. I
wish I’d said it.
Mr. Fry. It was done by a wag in our
eleven— I mean our office. Just as
quick as saying knife. London's a
wonderful place.
Mr. Frederic Harrison. Any exercise
is good that distracts the public from
crowding grounds in order to see thirty-
two hired bravos kick themselves to a
jelly.
Mr. Fry. What game is played by
thirty-two hired bravos ?
Archdeacon Sinclair. Not lawn tennis?
Mr. Frederic Harrison. No, certainly
not; football.
Mr. Fry. Why thirty-two? Do you
count the referee and the umpire?
Canon Hemsley Henson. What about
the linesmen?
Mr. Frederic Harrison. Oh, well, it
may not be thirty-two; but they are
hired bravos anyway, and they kick each
other to a jelly. I have often thought
about it with pain as I scaled Mount
Everestor Aconcagua. If only our young
men would all become mountaineers it
would be a great thing for England.
Archdeacon Sinclair. Would not Court
Tennis, if universally played, tend to
national salvation?
Mr. C. B. Fry. I think not. Owing
to the limited accommodation of the
dedans, the spectacular possibilities of
the game are almost nil. And what is
the use of a game which does not lend
itself to constant journalistic comment?
I doubt if our Chairman knows the
difference between a “boasted force” or
“chase better than two.” Chase me.
Editor of the “Daily News.” Both
“Court Tennis” and the “Royal and
Ancient” game of golf seem to me to
suggest something fulsomely monarchi-
cal. The word “chase,” moreover, is
associated with Buckhounds, game laws
and other aristocratic excesses.
Mr. C. B. Fry. Possibly you have
never heard of PETER LATHAM?

his Christian name. Is he a Passive

CUPID AT KEW.
[“Of more than a dozen young women who
took up the pursuit of horticulture at Kew
Gardens, not one remains... ‘We have known
no more enthusiastic pupils than the ladies
either in the Gardens or at lectures, but we
feared the movement would not last,' said the
Curator at Kew Gardens. “At, our annual
dinner one of our directors stated plainly that
the day of the lady gardener was past. He
referred of course, to the many matrimonial
engagements which had been the outcome of
the movement.’”—Daily Mail.]
OFT in the early morning
I've brushed away the dew
That hung like gems adorning
The Paradise at Kew ;
There 'mid sweet scents that floated
Around me, I have noted
Twelve Eves—un-Eve-like coated
In decent garb of blue.
They flitted 'mid the roses
Like butterflies, more fair
Themselves than any posies
That bloomed beneath their care:
Their fairy forms went tripping
From bed to bed, here snipping
A graceful lily, clipping
A Gloire de Dijon there.
Or if the ground was muddy,
Or April threatened showers,
In scientific study
They spent the golden hours;
Dull lecture-rooms they sat in,
They talked of trees in Latin,
And even learnt to chat in
The language of the flowers.
To chemistry they hied them,
And while with nodding head
The drowsy men beside them
Were sleeping like the dead,
They sat with brows well knitted,
While o'er the pages flitted
Swift pencils which omitted
No word of what was said.
Had Eve continued daily
The task she had begun,
What blooms had blossomed gaily
To greet the noonday sun'
But whilst her flowers she tended,
Young ADAM, gay and splendid,
Amid the roses wended–
He came—he saw—he won.
When EVE the first was married
She knew no household woes:
Her business on she carried
Unchecked by darning hose;
She sewed no hateful buttons,
Nor dreamt of beeves and muttons;
For then the veriest gluttons
Could well dispense with those.
But life's more complicated
Than in the days of yore,
And now when maids are mated
Their great careers are o'er:
These Eves have doffed their gaiters
To wheel perambulators,
And desolate Curators
Shall view them nevermore.

[APRIL 13, 1904.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A VISIT TO HIGHBURY.
(In the manner of Lady Ribblesdale in the
“Nineteenth Century.”)
WE paid our first (and last) visit to
Highbury on the 5th of November, 1903.
On reaching Birmingham we found that
the only conveyance available was a
station omnibus, which just held me,
my maid, and belongings, so BABBLES-
DALE had to walk all the way to Edgbas-
ton in a dense fog. Our progress was
slow and perilous, and I was very glad
when we entered the gates and heard
the cheery bark of Mr. CHAMBERLAN's
poodle, Zollverein.
There was PHARAOH, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's
chief butler, on the steps, and Mr. JESSE
CoLLINGs with an embroidered satin
waistcoat tripping to meet us in the
hall.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN came forward with
his most charming manner, and said,
“I feel very guilty in having brought
you into all this fog. It looks as if I
had specially prepared it for your recep-
tion; but, as a matter of fact, we have
had a fog ever since ARTHUR BALFOUR
was last here.”
From the first our visit to Highbury
depended upon the other guests who
were expected—the German EMPEROR,
the Editor of the Spectator, and the
Duke of DEVONSHIRE and Mr. SARGENT.
If they had been unable to come we
should not have been bidden, as solitary
guests at that time were considered too
exhausting for Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, who was
busily engaged on the preliminaries of
his Tariff Commission. As none of
them had arrived a certain air of reserve
was displayed by our host, but this was
happily dispelled when, on our reas-
sembling in an ante-room before dinner,
we found the missing KAISER, Duke,
Editor and Painter. There was no sign
of BABBLESDALE, and Mr. SARGENT, armed
with a dark lantern, gallantly sallied
forth to meet and guide him home.
Soon after entering the dining-room
plates filled with hot water were placed
on the table, and a jar of Liebig was
handed round. By an error of judg-
ment PHARAOH brought it to me first.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN became uneasy, and
whispered to him to hand it to the
KAISER, but finding all his signals
unavailing, sought to divert attention
by calling his illustrious guest's atten-
tion to the design and length of the
spoon laid for his special use. Then he
began to talk of Glasgow and his recep-
tion there. He asked the KAISER if he
had ever addressed mass meetings of
this kind. The KAISER replied that he
always spoke urbi et orbi. Whereupon
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN gave us a description
of the megaphone and the symptoms of
influenza, a précis of David Copperfield,
and an account of the process by which
soda-water bottles are blown at St.
Helen's.
On my asking him whether he had
called his son after the authoress of
Pride and Prejudice he replied that he
had not; which was, I thought, very
frank of him at such a time.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN always required the
most delicate steering. Many is the
keen regret I have had over the precious
moments wasted on tallow candles,
crockery, poultry shops, the cultivation
of strawberries, etc. He covered such a
vast area, and his interests were so
universal, that you were practically never
safe, and he was off before you were
aware you had given him his head, and
then the difficulty was to turn him.
The Caucus, even in Birmingham, is
hardly inspiring; but Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
made some interesting digressions from
the excellence of their worthies to the
Birmingham people. He said they were
the finest and most heroic race in the
world.
Between the courses I had time to
examine the wall paper of the dining-
room, which was a dull red, presumably
chosen to throw Mr. JESSE Collings'
delightful whiskers into charming relief.
Iought to say that BABBLESDALE and Mr.
SARGENT came in with the dessert, both
rather cross. BABBLESDALE had mistaken
the way and wandered into Aston Willa
football ground.
BABBLESDALE got to work at once, and
quoted a remark by the Marquis Ito to
the effect that “the world revolves upon
its taxes.” Mr. CHAMBERLAIN apparently
liked this, but his disapproval was quite
as marked when BABBLESDALE ventured
to describe the Sheffield Programme as
beatified common-sense. is brows
met; there was disagreement, indigma-
tion, sorrow for the misguided, and a
hundred other expressions in the shake
of his head.
After dinner Mr. CHAMBERLAIN lay full
length on the hearth-rug, taking no
exercise, as was his wont, while we
made a semi-circle around him and dis-
cussed a thousand topics. BABBLESDALE
said some very good things, but the
KAISER was obviously distrait, and the
DUKE not so wakeful as usual.
Cards were brought out at nine-thirty,
and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN took a hand at our
table, the other players being the Editor
of the Spectator, myself, and PHARAOH.
As, however, Mr. ChamberlaiN refused to
move from the hearth-rug the game was
difficult.
The next morning we were told by
Mrs. CHAMBERLAIN, in answer to some
solicitous questions from her husband
as to the comforts of the Duke of DEvoN-
SHIRE, that his fire had smoked badly
during the night. Our host's expression
of sympathy when the DUKE came down
to breakfast baffles description. Keener
distress could not have been shown for
the loss of a Birmingham seat.
I watched with interest to see how far
the DUKE would deem it his duty to
spare his host pain. But he was troubled
by no scruples of this kind: the smoke
had been very bad indeed, but it had
not kept him awake. He added, how-
ever, with a flash of unfamiliar humour,
“Smoke comes natural to a CAVENDISH.”
Reassured by this quip, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
banished the frown from his brow and
proceeded to cut slices from a large
loaf which, with jam, pickles, and cold
New Zealand tongue, constituted the
7rºenºl.
WINSTON CHURCHILL was the chief topic
during breakfast, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN con-
tending that he was the most dangerous
man to the peace of Europe. Mr. JESSE
CoLLINGs stoutly maintained that the
prolongation of the Boer War was
entirely due to his escape from Pretoria.
The KAISER, who had been busy paint-
ing an allegorical picture in the orchid
house, now came in clad becomingly in an
artist's blouse. The teapot was unfor-
tunately exhausted, but with great
presence of mind PHARAOH dropped two
or three walnuts into it from the pickle-
jar and filled it up with hot water.
Luckily I was able by an eloquent kick
under the table to prevent BABBLESDALE
from indulging in the dangerous luxury
of another cup.
After breakfast I walked round the
orchid houses with Mr. JESSE Collings.
His hat was quite unique, and of so
amazing a construction that I could not
help asking where he got it. “Where
did you get that hat?” was the form
my question took. He could not re-
member. It had a conical crown of
yellow straw, with a cock pheasant's
tail-feather stuck in a green ribbon, a
peak of patent leather, and a strap
under the chin like a policeman's helmet.
Mr. Collings wore it on one side with an
infinitely rakish air.
From the orchid houses we went into
the library, which is entirely filled with
editions of DICKENs. Mr. Collings kept
his hat on, owing to the defective heat-
ing arrangements.
During the morning all the guests
left except myself and Mr. DREw, who,
however, during the week I was in the
house, never showed himself once,
although a place was always laid for
him. Mr. WITHDREw, our host wittily
called him. By the third evening I had
got so accustomed to his absence that it
ceased to depress me, although Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN made the joke regularly at
every meal. But ºld. is his charm
that nothing he can do is wearisome.
I left at the end of the week.
After being with such a personality
the world felt cold and stagnant.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MAN'S INHUMANITY TO BOY.
[According to Dr. F. E.TAYLER, of Liverpool,
impositions and keeping-in are harmful. He
strongly advocates corporal punishment in
schools. “I think the birch a capital instru-
ment,” he says.]
A MEETING of representatives of the
Public Schools was held last Friday, the
subject of debate being, “That this
house approves of Mr. TAYLER's remarks
on corporal punishment.”
Mr. ToM BROWN, of Rugby, the pro-
poser, had, he said, sometimes been
called a typical public-schoolboy. He
did not know whether he justified the
description. (Cries of “Yes, yes.”)
Very well, then. All he could say was
that he had been flogged repeatedly in
the first half of the book, before he met
his friend ARTHUR, and it had never
done him any harm. It had stung for
the moment (Cheers), but the after-glow
was rather pleasant than otherwise.
(“No, no.") At any rate, he thought it
would be a bad thing if there was no
flogging.
. “STALKY” CoRKRAN, of Kip's
Home for Juvenile Demons, seconded.
The fact of the biznai was, he said, that
everybody except Gadarene swine and
jelly-bellied flag-flappers liked bein
slain. He himself always gloated.
Besides, how was an author to end up
a story of real school life except with a
flogging? He must now hurry off, as
he had to put some decomposing rats
in Mr. PROUT's bed.
Mr. ERIG WILLIAMS, of Rosslyn, op-
posed. Flogging, he said, was all very
well for the villain or the comic-relief
characters, but when it came to the
hero !. He had been flogged. Did
he burn with remorse and shame at the
conclusion of the ceremony? No. With
rage and passion. He attributed to the
effects of his punishment his subsequent
theft of Mr. GoRDON's pigeons and the
funds of the cricket club. Had he not
been flogged, he thought he would not
have taken to drink. Previous to the
operation a small lemonade had satisfied
him. Afterwards he saw life in a glass
(of beer) darkly.
A Winchester representative rose to
second the last speaker. He agreed with
Mr. WILLIAMs that flogging was a bad
thing. Not that he minded the birch.
But there were fives-bats and ash-plants.
He resumed his seat with an expression
of pain.
#. Jones, of Haileybury, said that he
approved of flogging, because it lent a
distinction to a school. Why was Hailey-
bury famous? Because Mr. CoRNwallis
had lowered the 'Varsity record for the
Half-mile? No. Because its headmaster
was related to the Colonial Secretary?
No. . Why, then? Because on the day

school broke bounds, and were flogged
at one gigantic swoop clean off the
reel.
Mr. Robinson, of Harrow, said that
flogging was a jolly sight better than
lines. Besides, you could always use a
folded towel or something. (Deafening
applause.)
Mr. WILLIAMs now rose for the second
time. It seemed to him, he said, that
the matter was capable of a very simple
solution. Masters should rule by kind-
ness rather than force. How much
more lasting an effect it would have if,
instead of brutally assaulting a boy,
of the relief of Ladysmith the whole
a master were to present him with
an orange or a sponge-cake, together
with a few gentle words of reproof.
There might be a sort of sliding-scale
arranged for the purpose. Thus, if
found out of bounds, the culprit might
receive butterscotch. For misbehaviour
during school, a bag of pear-drops. For
theft or smoking he would suggest a
substantial tea with muffins and anchovy
paste. Under such a régime the Perfect
School would be a certainty.
The motion was then put to the vote,
and lost by a large majority. Mr.
WILLIAMs was desired to forward details
of his scheme to the headmasters of all
the schools in the country.

THE GAIETY GAUL.
THE agreement with France has been
signed, and for some nine months or more
our feelings towards our French neigh-
bours, and, let us hope, theirs towards
us, have grown more friendly, which
must please every sensible Englishman,
from the KING downwards. Yet for
about half those nine months a lively
actor at the Gaiety has been amusin
crowds of more or less sensible ...;
people with the representation of a
creature supposed to be a Frenchman.
The Gaiety girl is one of the noblest
institutions of our country, especially
when she becomes a peeress, but the
Gaiety Gaul, perhaps appropriate and
amusing at the time of the Fashoda
dispute, now lags superfluous on the
stage.
The talented (and numerous) authors
of The Orchid have discovered a remark-
able type. They ignore—perhaps ils
#."." existence of gentlemen in
rance as well as in England. They
appear, however, to have observed that
there are counter-jumpers, snobs, mounte-
banks, lunatics, and contortionists in
both countries. By endeavouring to
blend these five types the authors hoped
to evolve a comic Frenchman. They
have produced only a monkey. Will
they forgive an Ejiº, for pointin
out to them that this is a graceful j
charming expression of our present
goodwill towards the French * As to
the “understanding” with France, that
is of no consequence. The simian
Frenchman of the Gaiety is one of those
things that no fellah can understand.
But the talented (and numerous)
authors, convinced that every Frenchman
must be a monkey, have another surprise
for us. According to them Frenchmen
in France talk broken English to each
other. Strange that no English traveller
has observed this '
Imagine the talented authors them-
selves at Brighton, a miserable substitute
for Nice, but sufficient for our argument.

the richest and gayest bachelor in Lyons. In spite of which,

wealthy roturier merchant, has had the cheek and presump-
tion to refuse my hand in marriage!
Glavis (aside). So she has mine ! (Aloud) What could have
induced her to do that ?
Beau. Because I am, forsooth, a mere commoner, as my
father the Marquis lost his nobility in the French Revolution,
and the ambitious little hussy turns up her disdainful nose
at anything under a title. -

Long live
Landlord. Only the pride of the village—young CLAUDE
MELNOTTE, the gardener's son. We call him “the Prince,”
because he has educated himself above his station, which has
rendered him extremely popular. He has just won the first
prize in a local shooting match, and is madly in love with
PAULINE DESCHAPPELLEs, the Beauty of Lyons, who does not
even know him by sight. [Eacit.

ºf thanks and compliments from the beauteous PAULINE for
the love-verses I gave you to deliver to her? (GASPAR silently
holds out a bulky packet.) What—returned without a word?
Gaspar. Chucked at me by a flunkey, with the remark
that his lady had never been so insulted in all her blooming
life! Nay, worse ! I have borne that which no Frenchman
can suffer without indignity-–they kicked me out!... I could
show thee the marks—but, well, no matter. It seems that
thy poetry must have been rather—— [Eacit, injured.

here to justify their kicking poor GASPAR so severely as that.

merchant's daughter? Oh, to be revenged on this arrogant
beauty' But how 2 [Enter BEAUSEANT and GLAvis, R.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The title of John Oliver Hobbes's latest work, The Vine-
yard (FISHER UNwiN), will not help the reader to forecast its
drift when he takes the book up, nor does it convey any
suggestion of appropriateness when he lays
it down. “Why Rookery 2” Betsy Trot-
wood sharply asked David Copperfield's
mother when she mentioned the name of her
domicile. “Why Wineyard?” my Baronite
would like to ask the brilliant author.
Possibly the explanation may have some-
thing to do with the fact that the plot
works itself out amid rural surroundings,
of which there are many dainty touches.
In the main it is a series of clever studies of incompatibility
of temper in Persons About to Marry. Jennie Sussex is a
charming little woman, a trifle uncertain in performance of
duty of making up her mind. Allured by the physical
attractions of a handsome animal, unprincipled, uncultured,
wholly unattractive in other respects, she falls in love with
him. They become affianced, he characteristically insisting
upon the engagement being kept secret. This enables
Gerald Federan by and by to make what, from a commercial
point of view, is a more advantageous marriage. Having
meanly defrauded everyone all round, and being himself
cheated by a more accomplished scoundrel, he finds himself
under the necessity of providing a sum of £15,000. This
happened to be the fortune of Rachel Tredegar, whom he
had originally schemed to rob. So he throws over Jennie
and makes love to the heiress, who incontinently yields
| herself up to the charm of his god-like countenance, the
grace of his shapely limbs. Rachel Tredegar, though not
presented as the heroine, is the most interesting, because the
oddest, of the many women who play their part in the
drama. That young gazelle, Jennie, having suffered much
vicissitude of the affections, marries, not a market gardener,
as was the habit of the fair known to Dick Swiveller,
but a drawing-master. The wooing of these two is, in its
way, as quaint as are the successive enterprises in the same
field of Gerald Federan. As far as sparkling literary style,
shrewd saying, and incisive view of passing character are
concerned, The Vineyard will rank with John OLIVER's best
work.
The Celebrity at Home, by Violet HUNT (CHAPMAN AND HALL),
is an eccentric sort of book with an attractive cover and a
title that suggests great possibilities to a too imaginative
reader who, it is possible, may find himself somewhat
disappointed.
One of my Junior Baronites reports: “I have just read
The Napoleon of Notting Hill (John LANE), the first novel of
the #. and paradoxical (some would say “brilliant but
paradoxical') essayist, Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON. It not only enter-
tained, but fascinated me. Why? Honestly, I should find
it difficult to explain. Not because of the love-interest, for
the very sufficient reason that there is not a single female
in the whole book. Nor yet because it gives an imaginary
picture of London a century hence—for the reader who
expects ‘anticipations’ in the manner of Mr. H. G. WELLs
will be disappointed; it pleases Mr. CHESTERTON to assume
that the London of that day will be precisely the same as
now, only, if possible, more so. I can't give any idea of
the story, łº saying that it is wildly fantastic, and even
preposterous. If you asked, as the Scotchman did of Homer,
what it was intended to prove, I could only answer with
a very uncertain voice.
“The author may have meant to point out the danger
of a hypertrophied sense of humour—but this is scarcely
a fashionable ailment at present. Or he may have de-
sired to show the disastrous results of being without any
sense of humour at all—though there are few withers,
even at Notting Hill, that will be wrung by his “awful
example.’
“Should we learn the lesson that Patriotism is not a
whit more sublime or more ridiculous, whether it embraces
the whole British Empire, or is concentrated on Notting
Hill? Or that Romance may lurk in the most unlikely
quarters and personalities; or that Life without the spirit
of Militarism would be but a humdrum affair?
“I don't know, nor do I much care: I am content to
accept the story as an excellent jest, to enjoy its wit, its
picturesqueness, the vivid realism of even its most outrageous
incidents, while Ifancy I can see, here and there, a suggestion
of some deeper purpose—though it would puzzle me to
say precisely what.
“The author and his illustrator have, between them,
left little doubt as to the identity of one of the principal
characters—but whether in doing so they have or have not
overstepped the bounds of literary and artistic amenities
is a question upon which the original is best entitled to give
an opinion. I can only say that, for me, the book has the
charm of a new and piquant literary flavour, and that I
shall look forward to Mr. CHESTERTON's next work of fiction
with unusual interest. And I predict that many of his readers
will say the same.”
Given two sisters as closely resembling one another in
appearance as did Louis and Fabian dei Franchi, yet as
different in their lives as is the unprincipled rake from the
honest Bohemian; given also that the godfathers and god-
mothers of these two sisters being of a mildly humorous
turn, and enjoying, by anticipation, comic, or serious,
complications, conferred on their god-daughters the christian
names of Annabel and Anna respectively; add to this, that
good sister Anna is so devoted to reckless sister Annabel as
to take upon her own innocent shoulders the burden of the
latter's peccadilloes and crimes; and further let there be
two men of the name of Hill, so much like each other that
it is difficult to tell tother from which, and there you have
in toto the basis of the plot of Mr. PHILLIPs OPPENHEIM's latest
romance entitled Anna, the Adventuress (WARD, Lock & Co.).
It is well written, carrying the reader straight along, never
giving him time to pause, and bringing everyone out of the
awful tangle triumphantly. For just one second, at a very
critical point in the strange story of these heroines' lives, the
deeply interested reader, taking in every detail, will tremble
lest the absolute necessity for the intervention of a magistrate
(by a misprint we read “magistrates,” p. 262) should clear
up all mystery and bring matters down to a mere common-
place level. But Mr. OPPENHEIM knows his business
thoroughly; he is quite aware of the thin ice which must
be crossed, and he skims over it in a single line, apparently
without an effort, and so swiftly,
that the danger has practically
never existed. It is all good
melodrama, and the author in
writing it has adopted the me-
thod which should be the rule
without exception in all dramatic /
composition intended for stage ſº
representation, namely, that of .
letting his readers into the secret tº
and keeping his actors in the
dark. This he does up to a cer-
tain point, and then comes a real
surprise which does"great credit
to his boldness of invention.

HOME THOUGHTS FROM ABROAD.
II.
BENEATH a noon athirst to spend
The night's largesse of healing dew,
Russet and grey the rocks descend
Sheer to É. shoreless blue;
Blossom of almond, bloom of peach
From crannied ledges lean their banners,
And Nature, far as eye can reach,
Adopts the most engaging manners.
Here, closely linked, the dancing hours
Renew the one unwearying strain;
Each season flaunts her spoil of flowers
Moving with jocund steps and fain;
And Winter's self, the mate of Spring,
Checks not the feet that follow after;
And April weaves her daedal ring
With never a tear to dim the laughter.
Man, too, where other prospects please,
Is not, as usual, simply vile;
His lesson learnt at Nature's knees,
He wears an entente cordiale smile;
I hear his happy, reckless hoot,
I breathe his generous pungent odours
Where all the lower Corniche Route
Resounds with Anglo-French exploders.”
Why, then, should I desert a spot
That makes my vagrant waistcoat thrill,
Prompting the rhymes I loosely dot
Down on my local washing-bill?
Why quit a world whose beauty wakes
The lyre of middle-aged Apollos,
And seek a dubious clime that breaks
The back of disillusioned swallows?
Is it in view of BRowNING's words
Touching the charm of British Springs
That I, with those misguided birds,
Propose to fare on northward wings?
Is it because my spirit pines
For London's over-rated season 2
No, it is not. The following lines
Confess a larger, loftier reason.
There is a moment (just behind
The vernal equinox it falls)
When patriots, like the undersigned,
Are ware of England's voice that calls'
At once, from bower or bath or bed

M. BOUDIN IN ENGLAND.
No. II.
I HAVE tried on more than one occasion to explain to
Boudin that one of the numerous secrets of our greatness as
a nation is our resolute devotion to sport and open-air
exercise, and the consequent hardihood and indifference to
danger which are bred in us by these pursuits. “Boudin,”
I said to him the other day, while we were on our way to see
al #". football match between the Southminster Meteors
and the Stonewall Thursdays, “Boudin, it's a wonderful
thing this love of sport that is implanted in the British
breast. We hold by it a great deal; our public men en-
º it. You will see Lord SoMERSHAM kick off the ball
to-day.”
“Ah,” says Boudis, “Lord SoMERSHAM is a player of foot-
ball? I did not know. Which side does he play on, this
lord 2 Is he a strong man 2 Can he run fast and kick the
ball far?”
“Why, no,” I said. “I’m not sure that he ever played
football himself, and, as to strength and pace—well, you'll
see him and judge for yourself. But you must admit that
it's a thing to have a man like that—an Earl, you know,
and all that sort of thing—showing an interest in the amuse-
ments of the people. We hold that in this way we avoid
revolutions and bring classes together, don't you know?"
Well, you may believe me or not, but it's the plain truth
that Boudin, if I may say so, wouldn't have this at any
rice : -
p “I know your SoMERSHAM,” he said, “as well as if I had
already seen this lord who is not a football-player, but who
is to kick the ball once to-day with a patent leather boot.
He will not kick him very far, oh no, but he will kick him, and
the spectators will give lively applaudings and he will walk
away thinking he is a splendid fellow for giving this kick,
and the crowd will think they are splendid fellows because
he has come down amongst i. We have not quite got
rid of our SoMERSHAMs in France: they are still there, but we
do not fall down and let them put their patent leather boots
on our necks.” -
“My dear Boudis,” I interrupted, for we were walking
with many others, and I didn't care to have such sentiments
addressed to me without protest. “My dear Boudis, you must
admit there is some slight difference between a monarchy and
a republic. A republic is unfavourable to the growth of
individuality: it cultivates a dead level of respectable
mediocrit ->
“Oh,” laughed Boudin, “I know that phrase by heart. I
have read it myself in your Daily Something or other. It is
a beautiful phrase and very consoling, and it goes on that a
monarchy like the British Monarchy which rests upon the
affections of the people can do—well, I really do not know
that there was anything that this newspaper thought it could
not do—but I do not think it explains Lord SoMERSHAM.
º these football-players, now—what kind of men are
they?” -
“The Southminster Meteors,” I replied, “are famous for
their great victory last year. The Stonewall Thursdays have
been, I believe, comparatively unknown until this year. In
fact their last season was almost disastrous, but the Com-
mittee includes some of the best business men of the district,
and they got together a considerable sum of money and

“Pay them ' " said Boudis, putting his hand up to his
head, like a man who has had a sudden shock. “Pay them!
Then it may be they are not from Stonewall these Thursdays
that are to play to-day! They are hired and paid. Oh, but
they cannot win against the Southminster men, those patriotic

Meteors who are not paid. I will bet
-five francs on the men of Southminster.”
“Pardon me,” I observed. “You do
not seem to understand. The South-
minster team is paid also. They are
both professional teams. I don't think
there's a man from Stonewall or South-
minster amongst them, except one, by
the way, from Stonewall, and he's play-
ing for the Southminster team.”
“But then,” says he, “they are gladia-
tors. They do not count. Where is
your love of open-air exercise in this?
You all sit and look on while twenty-
two men, who are well paid at so much
the kick, run about after a ball. Now
in France we play ourselves, not many
of us, it is true, but we do not pay
gladiators to amuseus. My dear friend,
ou are in your decadence. You are
ike the Spaniards with their bull-
fights.”
“Pardon me, Boudin,” I said, with
some asperity, “I cannot permit you to
compare our British football to anything ||
so degrading as a bull-fight.”
“Oh,” said he, “I take back the bull-
fight if you do not like him, but the rest
is true.”
At this moment we arrived at the
football ground, and went in. I have
left myself no room to describe either
Lord sº opening kick or the
progress of the match. It was a glorious
sight, such as you can see only in this
country. That much Boudis was forced
to admit.
THE GOLDEN MEAN.
TheRE be to whom the buttered bun
And thumping gingerbread appeal,
Who eat the artless Sally Lunn,
And swallow macaroons with zeal;
Who when they hear the bell for tea,'ll
Assume an obvious air of zest,
And eat enormously, yet feel
Quite comfortable in the chest.
Give me, at half-past twelve or one,
A homely but substantial meal;
Boiled mutton, slightly underdone,
Or ribs of beef, or even veal.
The prawn, the oyster and the eel,
The lobster's claw, the turkey's
breast .
Impair the wan digestion's weal;
But I consume them with the best.
I deem it cowardly to shun
The hidden terrors they conceal;
They give you pains, but never one
That patent pills refuse to heal;
Though I myself prefer to deal
Less drastically when oppressed
By too much food :-I simply steal
Into the library and rest.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[APRIL 20, 1904.
CHARIVARIA.
It is rumoured that, encouraged by
the success of the Anglo-French arrange-
ment, the Sultan of MoROCCO is about to
come to terms with the Pretender, the
basis of the agreement being that the
SULTAN is to have England, and the
Pretender France.
We are sorry to learn that the recent
sudden and treacherous attack by the
Thibetans on our men at Garu seriously
injured the photographs that the officers
were taking. -
By the courtesy of the Daily Mail
we are enabled to publish a further
Royal and Imperial Joke made by the
KAISER at Malta. In the gardens of the
San Antonio Palace the august visitor
planted a tree. As he did so, he said
wittily and laughingly to the gardener,
“Don’t forget to water it, GEORGE.”
The war-correspondents at Tokio are
stated to be spending their time playing
billiards. It is of course only natural
that they should like to see the balls
flying, and every now and then to hear
a Cannon. -
Mr. Justice GRANTHAM has been fined
£20 by a pickpocket without option of
imprisonment.
The Ayr Town Council has been
recommended by a public meeting to
re-elect Bailie MUNRo, the author of the
recent Burns Temple hoax, on the ground
that “a little nonsense now and then is
relished by the wisest men.” This idea
of giving the members of the Council a
chance of showing that they are, after
all, wise men, is really shrewd.
One of the conditions of the sale of
old British warships which took place
last week was that none of the vessels
was to be sold to the Powers now at
war. The dispute between the London
County Council and the Thames Steam-
boat Company therefore prevented any
of these vessels being purchased for
river traffic.
The Germans have fought an eight
hours' battle with the Herreros. The
Trades Unionists claim this as a victory.
In consequence of the recent theft of
cannon from the Rotunda at Woolwich,
all our new guns are, it is said, to have
a neat chemist's label affixed, “Not to be
taken.”
The Moore and Burgess Minstrels are
no more. Peace to their bones!
With reference to the edition of
DICKENs's works which a New York
publisher is preparing for millionaires,
we understand that the same is not for
reading, but merely to brag about.
A complete set, as already announced,
will cost £26,000. It is possible that,
later on, a popular edition at £13,000
will be produced.
It is hoped that the members of the
Football Club who so disgraced them-
selves at Tenby the other day will
shortly win a gaol.
We understand that next year the
Motor-Boat Races at Monte Carlo are
to take place in the evening, as the
effect of the illumination when a boat
catches fire is so much prettier in the
dark.
i"; and December cannot mate,”
said Mr. Plowden the other day. Our
recollection of last May is not so pleasant.
More Post Office delay! Mr. Boulding,
in an address to London spiritualists,
stated that he had only just received a
communication from ANNE BOLEYN.
MUSICAI, JOTTINGS.
THE BILGER FESTIVAL.
ALL the arrangements are now com-
plete for the Bilger Festival, which is
to be held early in June at Olympia.
In all, four performances will be given:
on Monday the 6th, Wednesday the 8th,
Friday the 10th, and Saturday the 11th.
Professor ERASMUs BILGER, who will
conduct the Festival, has never visited
England before, but his name has long
been a household word amongst us.
More strident than STRAUss, more exciting
than Sousa, more dramatic than WAGNER,
it is not too much to say that the famous
Bessarabian composer is now the fore-
most luminary of the musical world.
The programme for the opening day
will include the new overture The Siege
of Port Arthur, the new concerto for the
grosse caisse, and the Symphonic Poem,
The Devil among the Tailors. On
Wednesday will be presented the cantata
Pandemonium, the overture to The
Boilermakers, and a new scena for bass
solº and double orchestra entitled Stentor
defying the Thunder. Friday's pro-
gramme will consist of the oratorio The
Bull of Bashan, and Saturday's will be
devoted to extracts from the opera of
Armageddon, and the new puzzle sym-
phony Abracadabra ; or, He, She, and
the Postman. The above titles are all
literal translations from the Bessarabian.
As the Abracadabra symphony has
never yet been heard in England, the
following extract from an article by Mr.
H. CHOLLOP, the eminent American critic,
may interest our readers. Writing in
the Minnesota Mugwump Mr. Choi Lop
says:–
“Rigid and unmanageable in their simple
form as chunks of old red sandstone, the
themes become, in Herr BILGER's magical hands,
as plastic as putty, as digestible as blanc
mange. The working-out section in the first
movement, where the solemn strains of the
perdoneum are heard for the first time through
a shimmering mist of tremolando picaroons,
is in its way quite unique. As the poet
remarks, ‘imagination's widest stretch in
wonder dies away’ before the rhomboidal
conglucination of BILGER's polyphony. One
word, and one only, can dimly adumbrate the
galliambic frenzy of the Scherzo—it is salicylic,
unless indeed we should say atarambamphian.
The slow movement is more than divine: the
finale is the apotheosis of amentia. It used to
be said, See Naples and die. A better way is
to hear BILGER and get a new drum to your
ear.”
The orchestra, in addition to the usual
complement of strings and wind, will be
augmented for the occasion by the fol-
lowing instruments: Two Bombardo-
phones, three large perdoneums with
muted scoops, four bass jamboons, three
picaroons, two octoroons and one maca-
roon, four contra-zoedones (the first two
in D and A, and the two others in M
and N), four sitzbaths, one tubular
Italian bedstead, ten cab-whistles, three
pairs of kitchen tongs, one piccolo warm-
ing-pan, one sax-harpoon, one pestle and
mortar, two gas-jets (in C and C sharp),
and sixteen cockatoos.
LIMITATIONS.
For Mr. BEERBOhM TREE's Dramatic
School there is to be, as announced, a
“First Entrance Exam.” Quite right,
of course, but why not “a Second
Entrance Exam.” and another for a Third
Entrance? Or is there to be a special
class for students whose duties in the
art of acting are to be entirely confined
to coming on at the “First Entrance”
either “R.H. or L.H.”? If this be so,
should there not also be a very strict
examination of the pupils whose duty it
will be to get a rise in the Theatrical
profession by coming up “traps”? Will
the Grigolatis have a class which will
include the responsibilities of Wire-
pullers and the duties of flying fairies?
We are anxious to see a further de-
veloped prospectus of the School of
Treeatrical Art as soon as possible.

MORE NEW ELEMENTS.
(An Interview with Sir William Ramsay.)
The report that Dr. BASKERville, the
Trans-Atlantic RAMSAY, has discovered
several new elements in the radio-
active group, has not excited any sur-
prise on the part of our Sir WILLIAM
RAMSAY, whom one of Mr. Punch's
representatives recently interviewed at
University College.
“Yes,” said the Gower Street scientist,
“BASKERVILLE is an able chemist and
veracious investigator, and I place com-
plete confidence in his statement of the
discovery of two new elements, which he
has no doubt already tried on his hound,
an animal of a highly fluorescent tem-
perament. But, after all, the addition
of two new elements is a paltry con-
tribution compared with the half-dozen
which I have discovered in the last few
days.”
“Half a dozen 2'' asked Mr. Punch's
representative in amazement. “So
many?”
“O, yes,” replied the intrepid savant,
“I consider a day lost that does not
produce a new element.”
“And what are the latest?” inquired
the interviewer.
“Well, let us take them in order.
The first is Savillium, a gregarious
substance which gives off the well-known
Lankester Rays in great profusion and
intensity.”
“Can these Rays be used for illumi-
nating purposes?”
“Yes, certainly. One of them is now
installed at the Natural History Museum,
South Kensington, where it may be
observed in a high degree of activity.”
“This is profoundly interesting. I
implore you to continue.”
“Certainly: to proceed with my list.
Another of the new elements is Tim-
helium, found originally in some vitriol
waste at Bantry, co. Kerry. This is an
extraordinarily active and aggressive
element, the peculiarity of which is that
it is excited to an inordinate degree
by contact with the cognate elements
of Dillonium, Flavinium, or Davittium.”
The great scientist here paused for
breath, giving the interviewer an oppor-
tunity of recording his words exactly as
they fell from the magician's lips. After
imbibing a refreshing draught of liquid
air (DEwAR's Special Vatted) the speaker
continued:-->
“Corellium, another recent discovery,
is an extraordinarily beautiful but very
sensitive element, recently found in
mighty atoms on the banks of the Avon,
but as to its utility there is a conflict of
opinion.
“Lastly,” said Sir WILLIAM, “there is
Seelium, found all over the Isle of
Wight, and also for a while at West-
minster. Curiously, however, Seelium
vanished from Westminster for a short
period—completely. But it is now again
noticeable there. A very disturbing
element indeed.”
“And how long a life, Sir WILLIAM,
do you give these new forces?”
“They will disintegrate and disap-
pear,” said the Marvel of Science, “in a
very short time- one and all,” and with
these profoundly pessimistic words he
turned again to his liquid air.
DRY-FLY NOTES.
For THE VERY Rich.
HAVING secured a mile or miles of some
first-rate chalk-stream, and thus having
established his claim to social distinction,
the plutocratic tyro will next set about
providing himself with the apparatus
necessary to his sport. On this point
the following hints may be of service:
Waders.-These are essential. No
portion of the fisherman's outfit has a
more thoroughly sporting appearance.
As spurs serve to mark the fearless
horseman, so waders must always indi-
cate the successful angler. It is well to
enter the water from time to time. The
wet area resulting from this practice
will always create a pleasant impression
upon the mind of the spectators.
Brogues.—These should always be
built of canvas and brown leather. The
straps and buckles are very workman-
like, and nothing gives a better finish to
the costume.
Rod.—It is advisable to have a rod.
Should the fisherman find occasion to
walk any distance along the high-road,
the presence of this implement at once
declares his purpose to any brake-loads
of holiday-makers which may overtake

CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
or meet him. Without the Rod he
might conceivably be mistaken for a
farm hand. With it, the most ignorant
of tourists must know him for what
he is. -
Landing-net.—When using the high-
road as above-mentioned, it is customary
to slip the handle of this useful weapon
down the back of the jacket, allowing
the net itself to stand up immediately
above the head. This is very effective.
Of course, by the water, both rod and
met will be carried, each by its proper
attendant.
Flies.—No self-respecting fisherman
will provide himself with fewer than six
assorted dozen of these indispensable
little contrivances. Of these, five dozen
will be retained for purposes of com-
parison, discussion and exchange, should
the Waltonian meet with a brother of
the angle.
The twelve remaining flies will be
selected carefully from among the May-
flies, Sedges, Alders and other large
varieties, and will be sewn strongly on
to the cap, topee, or other head-dress.
This simple precaution will always win
the admiration of the uninitiated.
It is assumed that the angler for
whose benefit these lines are written,
though suitably wealthy, is one who
desires to conform as fully as possible
to the simple and unassuming canons
of his craft. The number of the atten-
dants who, it is suggested, should wait
upon him has therefore been brought
down to the irreducible minimum.
None but anglers of the very first rank
(incomes from £200,000 per annum
upwards) will find it necessary to sur-
round themselves with a greater number
of servants. In a few words then, and
by way of illustration, let us try to
indicate the manner in which a modern
trout should be brought to grass.
The Angler Proper will repair to a
tree situated at a convenient distance
from the water, thereunder to enjoy his
Regalia or his repose as his fancy may
suggest.
The Notifier of Rises will station
himself by the stream, the surface of
which he must closely scan for any sign
of a moving fish. This office involves
some responsibility, for he who fills it
must possess the power of discriminating
between the rises of small or large trout.
A really competent Notifier will never
bring his master to the waterside for
anything under three pounds.
On a fish being signalled the Rod-
bearer will betake himself with all
speed to the bank, and after getting
into position will let out sufficient line
to enable the Angler Proper to reach the
quarry. All being ready, the Notifier
will inform his employer of the fact.
. The Angler Proper will now come
into action. Taking the rod from its

bearer he will make the necessary cast,
rise and hook the fish, when, relinquish-
ing the split-cane to the Player (who
should stand close by), he will return to
his amusements. Nothing now remains
but for the Lander to slip the net under
the Spotted Beauty, for the Photographer
(who has already secured a record of the
successful cast) to develop his plate,
and for the Reporter (whose office may,
where Spartan simplicity is a desidera-
tum, be held by the last-named official)|
to send in his account of the capture to
enrich the columns of the Sporting
Press.

“Why Did You Not RUN Your Horse, UNCLE”
“BECAUSE THEY PUT Too MUCH weight on him, My DEAR.”
“I suppose THEY THought YoU MIGHT want to Ride HIM YoURSELF.”
SHAKSPEARE IN LONDON.
A BRIEF official announcement has
been made to the effect that on the 23rd
inst.—the anniversary of SHAKSPEARE's
birth and death—Mr. FAIRMAN ORDISH
will conduct a ramble through SHAK-
SPEARE's London, followed by a short
address in the Hall of Gray's Inn by
Mr. CARMICHAEL STOPEs. Mr. Punch is
glad to be able to supplement this bald
statement with the following interesting
details as to the itinerary to be followed
on the occasion.
Every member of the expedition
having been furnished with a copy of
BACON's Map of London, the procession
will form up outside Mr. SIDNEY LEE's
residence in Kensington, whence, sing-
ing in unison “Come unto these yellow
sands,” it will march to the Albert Hall,
where a pianoforte recital by Mr.
WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE will be given.
Between the moreeaua. Mr. FAIRMAN
ORDISH will lecture on “What SHAKspeARE
* -------
would probably have thought of the
Albert Memorial if he had seen it.”
The party will then move on to the
British Museum, singing “Sigh no more,
ladies,” where a pause will be made for
a review by Dr. FURNIVALL, in the cos-
tume of a Field Marshal, of all the
students in the Reading Room who are
engaged in Shakspearian research. To
each a copy of the latest homoeopathic
edition of Love's Labour's Lost will be
presented, together with a microscope to
facilitate perusal.
To the strains of “You spotted
snakes,” the procession will now seek
Madame TUss AUD's, where the effigy of
the Bard will be examined, and where
Mr. IsrAEL GoLLANCz will recite in the
Chamber of Horrors “O that this too too
solid wax would melt.”
The company, tearing itself away,
will then march four abreast to the tune
of “Om, Bacons, on,” viá Ham Common,
to Denmark Hill, and give an open-air
performance of Hamlet, with Mr. HARRIs,
the Sausage King, in the rôle of Polonius,
and Mr. ALGERNoN Ashton as First Grave-
digger.
#. programme will be fittingly com-
pleted by an al fresco fête in Stratford
Place, with old English games, climbing
a greased pole, tilting at the Quintain,
&c., organised by Sir GILBERT PARKER
and Sir LEwis MoRRIs, and a grand
costume conversazione and champagne
supper at the “Falstaff Arms,” East-
cheap, when the Laureate will present
Mr. FAIRMAN ORDISH with a butt of
Mºisie and sing “Hark, hark, the
rk.”

putting in a word for the trade of the

by the pound weight, with something
thrown in for the services of the artificer,
that filled his generous mind. Birming-

therefore, a right for preference in reap-

OUR MR. JABBERJEE IN THE FAR EAST.
PRELIMINARY Editorial NoTE.—As will be evident from our occasional
comments, we print our ingenuous Contributor's communication under
very considerable reserve.
I.
In War-Correspondents' Compound,
Tokyo, Japan.
March 20, 1904.
TO
Illustrious Editor of
London Punch.
MY DEAR RESPECTED !
I am fully conscious that your two eyes will jut
out in sheer amazement on beholding above superscription
of my whereabouts. [ED. CoMMENT.-As the envelope bears
an ordinary Indian stamp and Calcutta postmark, it would
not be surprising if they did.] For it is sure as a gun
that the very º, and Deities who superintended my
nativity did not for a moment anticipate that I was ever
to figure even indirectly as a bellicose ! -
And if my hard lines of Destiny have compelled me to cry
“Havoc ' " and give the slip to pugnacious Dogs of War,
I can only plead (like the impecunious Mantuan pharma-
ceutic, who dispensed a fatal dose to Romeo while severely
afflicted by love-sickishness) it was my Poverty and not my
Will that, wheezing “I will ne'er consent "-consented
I must make the dismal confession that, after presenting
my magnificent tragedy of Mr. Frankenstein in New York
City, it entirely failed (owing chiefly to excessive fire-alarms
and inclemency of dramatic season) to at all split the adder-
like ears of Transatlantic groundlings. In consequence all
my golden expectations of loaves and fishes incontinently
went to pot, and I was again on my beam-ends, without any
prospect of inducing same to meet !
But the darkest dawn has proverbially a silvered lining !
So, while still employed in busily bewailing my ill-fortunes,
I was infernally surprised by a reply-paid wire from hon’ble
Editor of the Chittagong Evening Conch, a highly respectable
local rag, [ED. CoM.–It MAY be-but we have failed to find it
in any list of Anglo-Indian periodicals] entreating me to
proceed sine die to Japan, in the capacity of Confidential
War-reporter'
My first instinct was to return a decided “Nolo Episco-
pari.” However, both my better halves, with their appur-
tenant mothers, together with all of my offsprings who were
sufficiently precocious to articulate a lisp, did urge me so
vehemently that I was not to mill a responsible sinecure
which was infallibly to bring grist to their internal mills,
that I reluctantly consented to render myself holocaustic on
Family's Altar.
Not to risk becoming a prolix by chronicling such very
miniature beer as the humdrum incidents of a journey to
Japan, I will at once ask you to imagine myself disembarking
at the town of Tokyo. [ED. CoM.—We are doing our best.]
Now, after arrival, I expected of course to be at once politely
forwarded to the nearest local scene of carnage—but, hoity-
toity! it turned out tout au contraire'
I found myself mewed up ignominiously, like pig in poke,
with sundry other correspondents of English, Scotch, Irish,
Welsh, American, and Continental nationalities without
being afforded the smallest facilities to exercise our cacoèthes
scribendi |
My fellow colleagues partook of humble pie in this Castle
of Indolents with too, too pigeon-livered pusillanimity—but,
though no swashbuckle, such indignities soon rendered me
cross as two sticks!
“Are we then mere cats, Misters!” I demanded, with
fiery and garrulous umbrage, “that we are to be hood-
winked under the thumbs of such undersized Asiatics? Is
there no one here with common audacity to go as bellwether
to some official big-bug, with the categorical imperative that
we are to be permitted to witness at least a mediocre
skirmish 2 ''
But all their tongues were tied by excessive sheepishness,
so, perceiving that I must work the oracle single-handed, I
undertook to buttonhole a certain military Sho-gun, a highly
influential old chap of the name of Hon’ble DAI ITCH1 GINKo,
[ED. CoM.–It is also the name of a well-known Japanese
bank] who enjoys the title of an hereditary Daikon. [ED.
CoM.–0m referring to our Anglo-Japanese vocabulary, we
find “Daikon” down as “a radish"—but of course it MAY
have another meaning.]
I was received in very polite affable style by the said Sho-
gun, who was in his ji of Audience, and luxuriously seated
upon a yebi, but wearing simply his national samisen.
[ED. CoM.–0ur vocabulary gives “yebi" = lobster, and
“samisen'' = a Japanese banjo-but no matter!]
I have the honour to append my verbatim note of this
momentuous interview. [ED. CoM.–Can Mr. JABBERJEE,
while in New York, have seen a performance of “The
Darling of the Gods”? We merely ask.]
Sho-gun (with rather too fulsome Oriental obsequiousness).
Industrious diffuser of intelligence, I break my bones upon
you. Augustly deign to seat your highly-scented self on my
miserable mat. Do you eat happily and well, and how is
hon’ble health 2
Myself (adopting, as British Subject, a bluff, hearty Anglo-
Saxon #. Hon’ble health, old cock, is fit as a
fiddle. But, as official mouthing-piece of amalgamated Cosmo-
politan fellow-war-reporters, I must beg to inform you that
we are getting hon’ble hump. We unanimously consider it
is high old time that we clapped our impercipient optics on
your hon’ble war-operations.
Sho-gun (fanning his bosom in effeminate fashion). Our
miserable little unimportant war is totally unworthy of your

English have very nice war of your own—in Thibet. Why
do you not go and report that?
Myself. Alas! I am no Leviathan of filthy lucres that I
can possibly afford a ticket to Thibet ! Besides, hon’ble
SHO-GUN, I and my poor unfortunate comrades are here on
the spot with orders to report progress—and how is it possible
to turn out so much as a single brick without some straw to
show the way of the wind 2
Sho-gun. We are hon’bly apprehensive lest hon’ble corre-
spondents should permit some rather unpropitious cat to leak
out of their hon’ble newsbags.
Myself. Surely, Polacious Sir, you are not so utterly obsolete
as to under-rate the sweet milk of a first-class advertisement?
You cannot desire to perform all your heroisms in a hole and
corner! Believe me, hon’ble Stylograph is mightier than
hon’ble Sword, and it is sheer §. to tuck up your
nose at the Power of Press.
Sho-gun. I miserably regret that I am unable to perceive
your hon’ble point.
Myself (significantly). If I am to be denied more bond fide
information, I might, perhaps, render a tit for a tat by cabling
crushing Japanese reverses and regrettable incidents to the
Chittagong Evening Conch.

tially on floor). Hon'bly excuse me for miserable ignorance!
I give you double bowings! That renders it, of course, the

tunately, we have no war, up to date, in

abjectly entreat you to accept this miser-
able free-pass to a front seat of war in

may take an assortment of my colleague-

fuse no favouritism to hon’ble representa-
tive of such a highly-renowned facetious.
Myself (going). I am most awfully
obliged, my dear old chap. I make my
little kowtow to you. [Here I went.
It is a superfluity to add that such an
unexpectedly felicitous success has ac-
quired for me an immense kudos with
all my fellow-special-reporters. And I
am serenely confident, almighty Sir, that
you too will be immoderately gratified
by the great liberty, I have taken in
sheltering my unworthy self under your
paternal aegis. Also that you will per-
ceive the nude necessity that the repre-
sentative of so tip-top a periodical as
Punch must of course be figged out on
very superior footing to the mere corre-
spondent of the Chittagong Conch!
I have the honour to report that
already I have incurred several out-of-
pocket expenditures - to wit: , some
acrobatic opera-glasses, a field bedstead,
a colonial riding-saddle (the steed for
same I can perhaps procure with more
economy in Korea—but I may have to
take some preliminary equitation lessons
from some Japanese jobmaster or other).
Please kindly remit funds to provide for
same by next mail. [ED. CoM.-We

all sinews of war, &c. are to be forwarded

likely to come to hand than if despatched
direct to so outlandish a neighbourhood
as Korea. [ED. CoM.—Quite so ||
I shall not require more (at present)
than about rs. 500—though an even
more moderate honorarium would not
be too scornfully rejected. In Japan the
rupee is called a “yen"—though of far,
far less intrinsic value ! Verb. sap. ' '
In all human probability, the Chittagong
Conch would consent to go snacks with
you for my working expenses--but, this
of course must be matter of private
arrangement between you.

tion) to such a benevolent and inimitable
blessed party! I am, Radiant Sir!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
DURING' his life it used to be lamented that Lord Acton
wrote so little. The marvel and the regret were the greater
because it was known, intimately by his friends, vaguely by
the public, that he knew so much. He
might have added precious things to Eng-
lish literature. He seriously, but too long,
contemplated writing The History of Li-
berty. It remained at his death “The
Madonna of the Future,” as Mrs. IREw,
appropriating the title of one of HENRY
JAMEs's novels, wittily called it. However,
Lord ACTON for awhile held office as Lord-
in-Waiting to the QUEEN, one grim flash of
humour in a life which humour did not obtrusively illumi-
nate. The world is indebted to Mr. HERBERT PAUL for giving
it The Letters of Lord Acton to Mary Gladstone (GEORGE ALLEN),
prefacing the volume with a scholarly biographical note.
Written without prospect of publication, they are the frank,
shrewd, commentary of a scholar and a man of affairs upon
current events, chiefly in English political affairs between
the years 1879 and the first month of 1886. Lord ActoN
doubtless went on writing throughout that troubled year,
which, as he predicted, in certain circumstances saw the
wreck of the Liberal Party. Writing on August 29, 1884,
he said, “The Home Rulers are going to be the arbiters of
Party government. That means ruin to the Liberal Party.”
He lived to see fulfilment of his prophecy, brought about
through the agency of the statesman at whose feet he ever
sat, an admiring, affectionate disciple. His faithfulness unto
this last was testified to by his acceptance of office—the
grotesque position alluded to --- in Mr. GLADSToxE's last
Administration. The volume is full of interest. Not the
least informing passage is found in a note, transcription
of a page from what Lord Actox calls “the precious
diary” of his correspondent. In this, recording a con-
versation at Hawarden under date November 15, 1881,
Mrs. DREw discloses Mr. GLADSTONE's contemplation of retire-
ment—this at a period little more than twelve months after
he had been returned to power by an overwhelming majority.
My Baronite does not remember any rumour of the intention
reaching House of Commons circles at the time. It is in
its way tragic to find that in considering his successor in
the Leadership of the House of Commons, Mr. GLADSTONE
mentioned Sir CHARLEs DiLKE as “the man best fitted.”
Were The Sanyasi, by Mrs. F. E. PENNY (CHATTo AND
WINDUs), considered only from one point of view, as a series
of scenes in Indian life, vividly and picturesquely described
in admirable word-painting, it would be a most interesting
work; but when added to this there are, passing through
these scenes, strongly-marked characters, native and European,
actuated by various passions and motives, every one in his or
her own way working out a gradually and artistically developed
plot wherein comedy and tragedy intermingle, we find our-
selves becoming so absorbed in the doings of these individuals,
that we cannot lay aside the story until we know the very
worst, and the very best, that the authoress has pre-deter-
mined for them. The animated scene of the pearl-fishery
is exceptionally powerful, and would arrest our attention
apart from its bearing on the main incidents of the
tale, of which, thus deftly worked in, this pearl-fishery be-
comes an essential part. Fascinatingly realistic too is the
description of life in Madras. Miggle, the Indian butler, is,
to an untravelled European, a study of a novel character,
convincingly true and intensely humorous. The scene between
this faithful servitor, who is almost as devoted to the for-
bidden sport of cock-fighting as he is to his most respected
-** - - - -
- - - - - - - - - -- -
and business-like mistress, who will have none of it, is as
good comedy as anyone could wish. Indeed for “a reading,”
emphatically in this instance “A Penny' Reading,” these
passages, if dramatically rendered, ought to be exceptionally
successful.
In Du'ala (SMITH, ELDER) Mr. GEORGE CALDERON has hit upon
a happy idea and -a wise man – he does not work it to death.
The story, brimful of fun and satire, is told in a small,
pleasantly printed volume. The hero is an old friend— the
Missing Link. Where the novelty comes in is in respect of
the adaptation of circumstances. The great ape is discovered
in Borneo, and is at the time of his introduction in the
company of Mr. Bone, the emissary of an American showman
in search of novelties. . . He has found the Missing Link,
dresses him in the clothing of Western civilisation, teaches
him to talk and to perform household duties. Mr. Bone, of
whom we see too little, is delightful. Best of all in a canvas
crowded with exaggerated types is the Missing Link itself,
“a thing of large majestic motions, eyes deep set under thick
eyebrows.” Through what to average man would have been
an exciting career the great ape lounges with the serenity
that comes of ancient birth and innate good breeding. From
kingship of a neighbouring tribe to acceptance of the post
of the Prime Minister, with a seat in the House of Commons,
nothing comes amiss to him. Amid sordid self-seekers,
latest fruit, of civilisation, the ape is in his simplicity and
single-mindedness the truest gentleman. My Baronite sus-
pects that was the lesson Mr. CALDERON set himself to teach.
But he does not let his moral run away with him and spoil
a pleasing tale. a
The Albert Gate Affair, by Louis TRACY (WARD, L. cK & Co.),
is a cleverly devised story of a robbery, successfully carried
out in spite of all safeguards provided by ward, lock and co.,
the “co.” in this particular instance being the police. The
romance is one after the manner of Sherlock Holmes and
Monsieur Lecocq. It is decidedly interesting, but only those
possessed of such mental gifts as would qualify them to
shine as criminal lawyers, detectives, or persevering solvers
of chess problems, can be expected to comprehend and
closely follow pursuers and pursued through the various
intricacies of their mysterious movements. The author is
gifted with a happy name for this kind of literature. He
should bring out Tracking Crime by TRAcy.
In The Tutor's Love Story (Constable & Co.), Mr.
WALTER FRITH, having selected the diary form for his
novel, has achieved success by means as simple as they
are artistic. In a few masterly touches you get the
diarist before you ; you proceed with him in his work,
his pleasure, and his trouble; and yet he is a man with
whom it is as difficult to sympathise as it is with the
conduct of the lady for whom he cherishes a secret
passion, and who, with equal secrecy, is in love with
somebody else. The slight inci-
dental sketch of the “society
Irishman" Johnny Ball, only
lacks the complement of a talent
for singing comic Irish songs,
with the brogue turned on pretty
strong, and catching refrains, to ſº
be perfect in its way. The Sta- ||
thams, artist and wife, are evi-
dently studies from originals.
It is a cleverly written and in-
teresting book, and, with the
exception of one incident, with-
out a note of sensational effect
from beginning to end.

CAN'T You Fix IT ON THE FRAME?”
MR. PUNCH's BUDGET.
IN order to meet future deficiencies
the following sources of supply are
crying aloud for the attention of Mr.
AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN or his successors:—
1. The Amount of Time wasted during
each Session by garrulous and obstruc-
tive Members of Parliament.—As the
number of hours in the day is limited,
and public time is a national asset, an
Imposition of Five Guineas per minute
(beyond the first ten minutes) is re-
commended on all Speeches in either
House, to be paid by the Member so
offending. The Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, who will of necessity require
some hours for the introduction of his
Budget in accordance with long-
established usage, will have the satis-
faction of feeling that his remarks are
thus automatically reducing the deficit.
The same Imposition, in a descending
scale, to apply to members of the London
County Council, and all other repre-
sentative bodies; also to Hyde Park
Orators.
2. Infants (up to the age of seventeen)
who have contracted the Cigarette Habit.
—A Duty, inversely increasing with the
years of the juvenile smoker and with
the price of the cigarettes, should result
in a large addition to the Revenue.
3. Bridge-players.-A nominal impost
of a penny on each game would go far
to relieve a Chancellor's embarrass-
ment.
4. Urban and suburban Dogs, Cats,
and Fowls.-A tax of one halfpenny per
bark, mew, or crow (as the case may be)
between the hours of sunset and 8 A.M.
might be suggested. The supply
appears to be inexhaustible.
5. The British Climate.—An excise
duty of one farthing per gallon above
the mean daily rai in the United
Kingdom to be levied on the Clerk of
the Weather, the Meteorological Office,
or other parties responsible.
6. Spectators at Cricket and Football
Matches.—A Poll-tax of One Pound per
head per annum on all mere onlookers,
shouters, and referee-baiters should
prove a valuable item on the credit side
of the national ledger. Players of any
athletic game and persons who exercise
their own muscles to receive a bounty.
7. Circulars, Handbills and Prospect-
uses of all kinds. –These delightful
ingredients of the letter-box, the per-
sistent appeals for Cast-off Clothes, Old
Teeth, Coal and Washing Orders, Eye-
sight Tests, and similar reminders so
touchingly ignored, might be made to
bear a sixpenny stamp. As some mil-
lions are distributed daily in London
alone by seedy and doorstep-dirtying
individuals, we have here a means of
wiping off the National Debt, not to
mention the Deficit.
8. Hyde Park and St. James's Park.
—Now that the season has set in, and
these two fashionable open-air dormi-
tories are once more being extensively
patronised by the free-and-easy classes
who toil not neither do they wash,
ground-rents might be levied from the
temporary occupants of each patch of
|grass and “all that messuage.” Every
|little helps, and the sum thus raised
| could go towards the salary of part of
a policeman, or the pin-money of one
of the Parliamentary housemaids.
We are not quite clear as to the best
means whereby the above contributions
may be collected, but are content to
leave such problems to experts.

“SWEET USES OF OBESITY.”
[Lines suggested by an article in the Daily Chronicle under the
above title, from the pen of Mrs. ERNEST AMEs, who discusses the
popularity, the social precedence, the immunity, from control and
criticism, enjoyed by the very, very fat woman. The author of these
verses wishes to express his extreme indebtedness to Mrs. AMEs for the
temporary loan of her theme.]
WHAT guerdon of praise shall I give her,
What measure of thanks for her meed
Who comes to release and deliver
My soul in its uttermost need;
Whose breath is the perfume of Parma
In seasons of dulness and drouth,
Who puts with imperative charm a
New song in my mouth?
I have sung (growing sadder and wiser)
Of Joseph, ; ways and his works;
I have carolled enough of the KAISER,
And more than he merits of PERKs;
I have harped on Sir LEwis (of Hades),
And drummed on a Laureate's vat,
But I never made lyrics to ladies
Whose foible was fat!
To the form that is elfin and fragile
And slightly defective of lung,
To the limbs that are lusty and agile
As is the opossum, when young-
I have bowed, I have bent, as in duty,
Unnumbered and dolorous knees,
But my heart never burst for a beauty
Distinctly obese.
- Yet here, I am told, is a topic
Inviting the bibulous bard,
| Like a well in the waste of a tropic,
- Whose price is as precious as nard;
The report of that pearly oasis
Ah, had I but earlier known,
I had sung long ago of her graces,
Sweet seventeen stone!
Though her figure be other than airy,
Though its “note” be the largeness of earth,
Yet her temper is that of a .
Addicted to methods of mirth;
Exuding a natural joyance
Her jests have an infinite scope,
And in bathing she bobs with the buoyance
Of Somebody's Soap.
By the calm of her weight that is welter
Immune from the menace of shock,
In her shade half a dozen may shelter
As under the lee of a rock;
There is that in her mountainous motion,
A force elementally free,
Which recalls to a student of Ocean
The surge of the sea.
In the glow that her presence diffuses
She fares as a favourite guest;
. Her pyramidal structure excuses
What license would ruin the rest;
No rivals, for Nature has built her
Compact of the substance of ten,
Would suspect her of pounding a philtre
For stealing their men.
-----------------
---
She is set with her face to the horses,
She flops in the roomiest chair,
And her bed, as a matter of course, is
A twin of the wonder of Ware;
They allow her the lengthiest tether,
er lines are in BENJAMIN's lot,
And she says what occurs to her, whether
They like it or not.
O profuse and imposing and passive,
O dame of the devious waist,
Whose circuit, amorphous and massive,
These arms could have never embraced,
You may puff, it is true, like a porpoise,
And heave like a wallowing hulk,
Yet your heart is as big as your corpus,
Our Lady of Bulk! O. S.
IRRESPONSIBILITY.
OF Saturday to Monday, officially described as “an irre-
sponsible comedy,”—whatever this may mean — by Messrs.
FENN and PRYCE, it is difficult for a “responsible” person
to express a decided opinion. As the timid Curate, break-
fasting with his Bishop, said of the indifferent egg, “It is
good in parts.” Now this is just the case with this irre-
sponsible comedy: it is good in “parts”; the parts, that is,
the “character parts,” being superior to the whole. And
moreover all the parts are capitally played.
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER has chosen to represent Lord
Culvert of Alcester (late Captain, R.N.), who is simply a
mere practical joker. Were he only a public-school boy,
aged fifteen, instead of a man well over thirty, he might just
escape flogging on the plea of “first fault,” and would be
dismissed with a severe caution. The sympathies of the
audience can never be with an actor of his position who
emulates the rôle of what Mr. GEORGE GROSSMITH has described
as “the Society clown.” Such a part, supposing it to have
been better written and in an altogether better piece, might
have been accepted at once by the public, had it been played
by that “chartered libertine” Mr. CHARLEs Hawtrey.
The success of Dr. Bill, of which character Mr. ALEXANDER
was the admirably merry exponent, affords no precedent, as
nowadays the public only see in Mr. ALEXANDER the impersona-
tor of some hero of romance, dashing, earnest, gay, . yet
with subtle touches of cynical humour. His public will have
him in costume, and regret his return to modern twentieth
century everyday attire.
Miss LILIAN BRAITHwaite is a delightful hostess as Mrs.
Wendover; Miss ELINOR AICKIN is a somewhat tryingly vulgar
elderly Lady Diana; as Angela, her daughter, #. EATRICE
Forbes-Robertson is a charming ingénue; as Miss Ursula
Toop and her friend Miss Skeat, Miss FRANCES WETHERALL and
Miss ALICE BEET, both being fearfully and wonderfully made
up, are perfect; and the neat handmaids Thompson and
Jarvis are rendered with natural grace by Miss CoRISANDE
HAMILTON and Miss NELLA Powys. As the colourless Probyn
Dyke Mr. A. WANE-TEMPEST is very amusing, but it is a
thankless part. Mr. HIGNETT, as a didactic clergyman, the
Rev. Lemuel Toop, gives us a decidedly clever sketch; and
as the ridiculous idiot Stanley Pidding Mr. WiviAN REYNoLDs
makes a great deal out of poor material.
There is plenty of bustle in the piece: the action goes
heart and reality, are de trop; and, except the young girl's
letter, cleverly read aloud by Miss AICKIN, the dialogue,
which is on a very ordinary level, owes whatever success it
|
with much laughter; the sentimental portions, being without
| may obtain to its brisk delivery with emphasis and discretion
by the actors.

LADY BABBLESDALE'S VISITS.
II.-CHATsworth.
We paid our last visit to Chatsworth
early in April, 1904, travelling by the
Midland to Rowsley, where a large
motor-van was in readiness for my
trunks. The Panhard Victoria, how-
ever, only just held me, my two maids
and the chauffeur, so BABBLESDALE once
more had to pad the hoof. On this
occasion, however, I had provided him
with an Ordnance map, and felt no
anxiety about his missing his way.
No incident marked our drive to
Chatsworth, except that, in passing
through the famous chestnut avenue
at Edensor, we nearly ran over Sir
M. E. GRANT-DUFF, who was reading
his diary aloud to some of the oldest
inhabitants. The chauffeur “kept a
gallop for the avenue,” and brought
us up in fine style at the main entrance,
where most of the house party were |Marcella. He said he always preferred
picturesquely grouped in expectation dry to sweet wines, and wanted to know
of our arrival. The Duke, in a brown had I seen Madame Sherry. From this
velvet lounge jacket, beamed a welcome the talk diverged to the national taste
from the top step; Mr. JoHN BURNS, in wines. Sir M. E. GRANT-DUFF recalled

explained to the Duchess the method by
which the bowls are concealed in the
coat-tails of the prestidigitateur. Sir M.
F. GRANT-DUFF was all the time writing
busily under the table.
BABBLESDALE, whose bump of locality
is not what it was, once again entirely
missed his way, and did not reach the
dinner-table until the plovers' eggs were
all eaten. There was a look of anguish
on his face which in anybody else's
might almost have seemed out of pro-
portion to the occasion. Keener distress
could not have been shown for the dis-
appearance of a favourite shirt-stud.
uring dessert the Duke complained
seriously of the thinness of modern
finger-glasses, and proved it to demon-
stration by the familiar musical experi-
ment of passing the hand round the
circumference. The Duke broke three
glasses before he was able to extract a
musical note.
The Duke said he doubted the value
of SCHOPENHAUER as a teacher, for he had
searched in vain through his works for
any recognition of the social value of
Bridge as a link between the classes and
the masses. Mr. HALDANE demurred to
this, but the general feeling of the table
was with the Duke, though Mr. PERKs
went so far as to say that he thought
working-men ought not to be encouraged
to play Bridge before mid-day. This
roused Mr. John BURNS's smouldering
indignation. “If an honest and intelli-
gent artisan,” he exploded, “is not to be
allowed to imitate the least reprehensible
recreations of the aristocracy, what
becomes of the dignity of labour?”
When the gentlemen rejoined us in
the great drawing-room, Mr. C. B. FRY
delighted the company by an exhibition
of parlour gymnastics, winding up with
a running jump over six Louis Quinze
chairs. The Duchess's face during this
last feat was a perfect study. A move
was then made to the music-room, and
Madame MELBA (who boasts of her
Scotch descent) and ANDREw KIRKALDY
charmed their hearers by a realistic
rendering of “We twa hae paidled in
the burn.” The entertainments of the
evening were completed by Bridge.
BABBLESDALE only revoked once, and
wittily apologised to his partner—the
Duke—by saying “Playing with you
made me º: it was Nap.”
We were all startled at breakfast by
an extraordinary occurrence. In the
midst of an impassioned discussion of
GoETHE and Wilhelm Meister, in which
Mr. HALDANE surpassed himself, BABBLES-
DALE was seen to pass the window. He
was so negligently dressed—his tie in
more than ordinary dishevelment—that
his attire, coupled with his ascetic linea-
ments, carried the honest socialistic heart
of Mr. John BURNS, who had not been
introduced to BABBLESDALE the night
before, by storm. He rushed to the
groaning sideboard and, seizing with
one hand the cold ham and with the other
a béchamel capon, he flung open the
window with his teeth and hurled the
dainties at what he conceived to be the
destitutemendicant. BABBLESDALE, whose
dexterity is proverbial, caught them ere
they fell, and with a ready smile pro-
mised that they should be conveyed to
the Buckhounds.
After breakfast Mr. LYTTELTON and
Mr. JoHN BURNS played Mr. C. B. FRY
and BABBLESDALE at single wicket on the
cocoa-nut matting pitch in the second
palm house. BABBLESDALE, who once, he
tells me, was no mean practitioner, seems
to have been out of form. However,
although he made no runs he broke
more panes of glass than all the others
put together.
Most of the next morning was agreeably
spent in those prehistoric peeps which
old photograph albums supply. Here
I discovered chubby, callow, bewhiskered
editions of the Colonial Secretary,
the present Prime Minister, and our
host in incredibly striped peg-top trou-
sers, and the tiniest of bowlers. I
must have made this remark aloud, for
Mr. LYTTELTON remarked, “Not tinier
than Bobby ABEL, I expect. He has
iven up bowling now.” On hearing
É. Sir MoUNTSTUART GRANT-DUFF was
heard to misquote dear MAT. ARNOLD:
“Ere the fleeting bon-mot fly,
Quick, thy tablets, Memory!”
or “taiblets,” as ANDREw KIRKALDY re-
º me Wee Macgreegor would have
Sal Cl.
By the way, owing to an unfortunate
slurring of consonants on the part of
the Duke when making the initial intro-
duction, BABBLESDALE acquired the pain-
ful impression that ANDREw KIRKALDY
was ANDREW CARNEGIE, the American
plutocrat. With his usual readiness to
put everyone at his ease, BABBLESDALE
addressed to KIRKALDY several remarks
bearing upon the endowment of free
libraries and the claims of democracy.
They never really got on to terms
until BABBLESDALE happened to mention
the &: he had in driving with
the CoNYNGHAM GREENEs in Switzerland.
KIRKALDY at once rejoined: “I’m no
sure whit wey they drive in Switzerland,
but there's no driving on the nS at
St. Andrews.” With incredible swift-
ness of repartee, BABBLESDALE rejoined,
“How about green tee, then?” At this
Sir MoUNTSTUART rushed from the apart-
ment to the conservatory, obviously in
search of a fountain pen.
Tea was more than usually comforting
that afternoon, and the Duke, who
always sleeps with a hop pillow, sat
down snugly at the table. As he
handed me the muffins, he said the
person who takes the top piece is as
self-denying as the man who chooses
the gizzard wing of a chicken.
After such company the life of London
was painfully exciting.
CHARIVARIA.
THE abolition of Mr. BRODRICK's Army
Corps can scarcely have come as a sur-
prise. It will be remembered that, when
the ex-War Secretary introduced the
scheme to the House of Commons, Sir
HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN congratu-
lated him on it.
Father CREAGH, of Limerick, has stated
to an interviewer that, if his persecution
of the Jews in that town has a su
outcome, he will, in his opinion, have
accomplished one good thing in his life.
This ambition to accomplish one good
thing in his life is laudable, but it seems
rather hard on those who have been
chosen as the means to the end.
As the result of two recent actions in
the High Court, mothers-in-law through-
out the country are reported to be
adopting a truculent attitude, and will
require careful watching.
It is characteristic of the change that
has come over Anglo-French relations
that, although the little boy who was
found abandoned in Paris the other day
was dressed in a sailor suit, and a cap that
bore the inscription “H.M.S. Powerful,”
he was not arrested as a spy.
A great sense of relief was experienced
here on the 16th inst. by the publication
of a telegram from New Zealand stating
that Mr. SEDDON considered the Anglo-
French Agreement satisfactory.
The over-feeding of infants has been
responsible for so many deaths recently
that it is proposed to legislate with a
view to making it compulsory for every
child to be marked with a load-line corre-
sponding to the Plimsoll mark on ships.
By the by, greedy little boys will be
interested to hear that in Greece a
“Swallow Feast” is held once a year.
The agitation in favour of “Clean
Milk” is already bearing fruit. But
care must be taken to see that the water
used for this purpose is first thoroughly
filtered.
The Rev. R. J. CAMPBELL, of the City
emple, who has just gone over to
Rome (viā Mt. Cenis), spoke recently on
the subject of the new Education Act,
and declared that “Nonconformists are
not prepared to give the Liberal Party a
blank cheque.” We think the epithet
regrettable as coming from a minister.

Editorial Note.—It is only due to our Readers to repeat that we are
very far from satisfied that our Correspondent's account of himself can
be depended upon—or even that he is at the front at all.
In Japanese Headquarters with
Homble. Col. Khakimono, Korea.
(Precise locality suppressed by Censorship Regulations.)
April 1.
AFTER a somewhat tempestuous transit as the Bird of
Passage on Japanese transport-junk Shimbun, I am now
deposited with all my paraphernalias in the Hermetically-
sealed Kingdom of Morning Qualm. I have been attached
to a flying column personally conducted by a rather diminu-
tive but dashing commanding officer, viz., Honble. Col.
KHAKIMONo, who is ably seconded by his honble. and gallant
friend, Major NETSUKé.
Korea has already succeeded in winning my golden
opinions. Possessing same latitude and longitude as Italy,
the climate . . . [ED. CoM.—The next few sentences, which
seem to have been industriously paraphrased from some work
of reference, are omitted.] . . . It is also the happy hunting-
field for carnivorous faunas—tigers, leopards, bears, caymen,
deer, otters, et hoc genus omne being plenty as black-
berries.
When not too engrossed in describing horrors of war, I
shall make best endeavours to secure a skin or two, which
I beg you will do me the honour of accepting as Office
hearth-mats and door-rugs.
As, by official order, all war-reporters are required to sport
proprietorial badges, one of my arms has necessarily been
ticketed “Conch’—but you will, I humbly think, be pleased
to learn that it is my right arm which is branded, in Japanese
characters, with the proud title of “Punch.” [ED. CoM.—
Most gratifying!] -
conspicuous a stigma has very naturally rendered me
a jaundiced eyesore with my fellow-reporters who correspond
for less humorous contemporaries, .#. too thick-skinned
to heed the malicious buzzings of such paltry flies in my
pomatum.
The Korean aborigines cut highly ludicrous figures of fun
in immoderately tall broad-brimmed hats, composed of horse-
hairs and fastened under their chops with ribbons and bows,
like antiquated British spinsters, and it is not possible to
encounter them without giving vent to uncontrollable
cachinnations.
However, they are highly polite, peace-loving parties,
though incredibly bashful and timorous.
I am setting up a stud, having become the sole proprietor
of a small but very lusty secondhand crock of piebald com-
plexion, for the rather moderate price of yens 25 (about
£2 10s.). This, lºng a necessary, you will kindly allow as
working expenses. have not baptised him as yet with
any nom de plume, and you must not take it in snuff if I
should not decide to name him after your illustrious self,
since he is scarcely deserving at present of so good-humoured
d º:
or he is of such an excessively noli me tangere tempera-
ment that it is not possible to venture my person within his
sphere of influence except under penalty of receiving some
shocking kick! One of these has severely dilapidated a
rather valuable gold-rimmed nose-pinch, and compelled me
to purchase a pair of native Korean goggles as a pis aller.
Although I can only nurture a slender hope that your
paternal generosity will decree me compensation for damages
which (perhaps) do not, strictly come under heading of
“ordinary wear and tear,” I may be allowed to mention that
a similar nose-pinch could not be purchased in Calcutta at
all under rs. 15.
You can readily suppose that, until the ferocity of my
aforesaid pony has abated, I am reduced to ride entirely at
anchor, and cannot be expected to scour the surroundin
sceneries in pursuit of tit-bits of information. -
However, I am far from being a mere dolce far niente, and
it is invariably the still sow, according to the proverb, that
takes in most of the pigs' washing. Accordingly I have
already wormed myself into the good books of Colonel
|KHAKIMONo, who imparts to me many important military
secrets which he preserves with the snugness of wax from
ordinary journalists.
For example, he has whispered, in strictest privacy, his
expert opinion that, should some irresistible Japanese force
encounter any invincible Russian army-corps, there will
infallibly result a somewhat severe snip-snap. This you may
regard as official.
With excusable national partiality he foregoes the con-
clusion that he is triumphantly to emerge on top. But,
although I refrain from clouding his cocksecurity by any
doleful vaticinations, I am wholly unable to believe that
it will be mere child's play for even the pluckiest pigmies to
succumb these Colossians of the North.
At present the enemy is reported to be retiring into his
own interior with seven-league boots, but I have the shrewd
suspicion that this is a trick to entice us into chasing a wild
goose.
So I have exhorted Col. KHAKIMONo that he is on no
account to make such a faux pas as Homble. BonAPARTE, by
pursuing so wily a foe as far as the metropolis of Moscow,
since he would probably soon find himself out in the cold
owing to some treacherous incendiarisms.
I am proud to say that my honble. friend has promised to
follow these counsels of perfection.
It is a popular fallacy (as I am cabling the Chittagong
Conch) to imagine that Japanese soldieries are rigged up in
old-fashioned panoplies, or that their field-pieces are fashioned
to resemble dragons and the like. On the contrary, they
all carry muskets which, though home-made, are far superior
to any Indian matchlocks. Whether they are as proficient
potshots as Russian marksmen, I am not as yet in a position
to say.
As for the cavalry, they have scarcely the firm seats of
ancient Centaurs, and indeed are by no means even such
practical jockeys as our native Sikh horsesoldiers.
Nor can I entirely commend the Japanese custom of
warbling national ditties when engaged in combat; whether
this is done to terrorise the enemy, or simply as a preventive
against funkiness.
For it is not possible to sing and shoot simultaneously
with equal correctness, while it is also mere waste of valuable
wind, since no song will reach the heart with the celerity or
certainty of a bullet.
However, it is not for this unassuming self to dictate to
the Goddess of War as to whom she is to award her apple of
Discord.
The National Religion of Korea consists in the worship
of Ancestors, but, for the convenience of parties who may
not possess such articles, and who would otherwise be
reduced to Atheism, it is permissible to venerate any local
demon.
This I learnt from a certain Bonze whose acquaintance I
have recently scraped. For, on presenting him, as my letters
of marque, with a back number of your salubrious periodical, I
discovered that, though constitutionally incompetent to under-
stand any Western waggery, he nevertheless received it with
profound awe as a kind of sacred shastra, to which he com-
manded his disciples to do poojah. And I myself, being able
(after a fashion) to expound the inner meanings of the

monious. My friend the Bonze, a very honest childlike old
chap, has made the rather ingenious suggestion that it might
be feasible to dedicate a small mountain shrine to your
Honour's lordship, with appropriate idol, faithfully copied in
local colours from your paper's frontispiece. It appears that
a neighbouring devil, owing to being ordered abroad on
active service, would be willing to dispose of his shrine,
goodwill, &c., for a mere song or mess of pottage.
This, I am fully aware, is the rank piece of superstition.
Nevertheless, it might be worthy of your while to think it
over as a business proposal, since all converts would of
course be required to become regular subscribers. I think
I could undertake to do the trick for (shall we say?) yen 200

your ships with a haporth of tar, why not have the effigy

small extra item in the estimate, and, with best quality
gilding, will indubitably be aere perennius.
I am anxiously awaiting your honoured instructions.

OPERA. OPERANDA.
ON Monday, May 2, take place the Two “Great Events.”
The Royal Academy opens its doors by day to the public at
the i charge of a shilling a head, that is at the rate of six-
pence an eye, and the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, by night
opens its doors to all and sundry at prices varying inversely
as the lowliness and loftiness of the purchaser's ition in
the house. Again we have M. MESSAGER, of the Mº
Musicales, as Manager for “the Grand Opera Syndicate,”
while, as heretofore in the satisfactory past, Secretary NEIL
Forsyth is to control “the business department.” No pleasure
without business: the greater the pleasure, the better the
“business done.” “Special performances” of certain operas
(nothing uncertain is worth mention) named in the list, are
to be given “without cuts.” Mr. Punch begs to state, for the
benefit of all concerned, that for his part (a very strong one in
every opera) he hopes to give from time to time some account
of these same special operas “with cuts,” otherwise “illustra-
tions,” forming a part of his “Operatic Notes,” which will,
by reproducing the lineaments of singers, musicians, and
operatic persons generally, present some features of interest
to the general public. Of what surprises may be in store for
Opera-goers, no foresight, nor Forsyth, can assure us.

THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT.
WHEN urchin voices wake the street,
Pushing the sale of “all the winner,”
And toil-worn City men retreat
From stocks and shares to rest and
dinner,
And Sol assigns the aërial heights
To Luna and her satellites,
I only at that cherished hour
Retain no sense of exultation;
For me no sweet suburban bower
Abuts upon the railway station:
No offspring welcomes me with kisses—
Chiefly because I have no Mrs.
For me beside the fender bulge
No large and languorous carpet-
slippers;
No aromatic airs divulge
The savoury mess of new-laid kippers;
No soul-reviving pint of Beaune
Lends the repast a giddy tone.
For I am of the luckless band
Who, when sweet ease invites their
neighbours,
| Still find, aggressively on hand,
The subject of their arduous labours;
Whose daily task is still to do,
Long after other folks are through.
Briefly, I am upon the Stage
Where oft provincial maids and men
mark
|The easy verve with which I gauge
The feelings of the Prince of Den-
mark;
It makes the artless rustic weep
|In places where the Drama's cheap.
|But here in Town my tedious art,
The common lot of all who plod, is
|To trifle with a thinking part, -
Or even “outside shouts, and bodies.”
|To play a lifelike corpse, observe,
| Requires intelligence and nerve.
Nightly for quite a paltry sum
I entertain my fellow creatures
|By putting greasy paints and gum
| "On what are really classic features,
| And striving freely to amaze
|The well-dined Public's torpid gaze.
Ay, there's the rub: it's not the waste
Of intellect that's so distressing;
And managers devoid of taste
Must be put up with, though depress-
Ing;
It's not that life leaves much to seek
In London on a pound a week.
It isn't that the hours are late,
The dressing-rooms extremely grimy;
That supers all expectorate
And usually say “gorblimey";
It is because I’m always fated
To have my meal-times dislocated.
What I persistently deplore
Is eating breakfast at eleven,
| And wrestling with a meal at four
That others have at half-past seven.
Food at such times may stay one's inner
Pangs, but it really isn't dinner!
And, long accustomed though I am,
It stirs my self-respect profoundly
To find myself consumingham
When otherfolks are sleeping soundly.
So late it hardly seems refined
To swallow food of any kind.
O how I long to dine once more
When other folks are also feeding;
And having dined to sit and snore
The solid hours away unheeding,
Nor care a cent how Chronos plies his
Hour-glass or when the curtain rises.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, April
18.-Lord DUNRAVEN, blasé with Biarritz,
nt up with the placid pleasures of Pau,
$º him of the }. ce to spend a
happy day. Not Rosherville, but the
House of Commons with Irish debate to
the fore. Remembers days of old when
PARNELL was in his prime, with JoEY B.'s
broad smile beaming over expansive
imitation sealskin waistcoat girt with
massive gold chain fashioned like a
ship's cable. Wit sometimes; always
humour, if occasionally of Donnybrook
Fair order. Certainly movement, fire,
iblv an explosion.
Pº. . to-day from Peers'
Gallery, DUNRAVEN finds NANNETTI on his
legs, making dull speech of prodigious
length on subject of Primary Education in
Ireland. Also O'DoNNELL–not him of the
eyeglass, who, nigh thirty years ago, used
to rise from this very seat and stir up
the Saxon. This is O'Donnell of Kerry
West, a national school-teacher. None the
worse for that. But alack! so long in
getting to what he thinks he wants to say.
In due course, in place of PARNELL with
his tall, slim figure, his keenly cut
intellectual face, his icy manner and his
biting sentences, comes portly John
REDMoxD, ornate, oracular, overbearing.
“I warn the right hon. gentleman,”
he said, shaking a fat forefinger at
WYNDHAM yawning on the Treasury
Bench, “we will not tolerate the creation
of a new Castle Board.”
Terribly severe John looks as he hurls
this threat amid a pom-pom of cheers
from Swift MACNEILL. WYNDHAM has
been warned so often in the same bass
voice with identical gesture that, like the
eel inured by repetition to what to begin
with was a painful process, he doesn't
mind it.
|
, “This is O'D-nn-ll of Kerry West.”
%
É
The Old “MAiTRE D'ARMES.”
“By Jove, he'll do!”
As for PRINCE ARTHUR, he knows
nothing of this new submarine destroyer
launched against an often-threatened
Ministry. He hurried off after questions,
as indeed did the vast majority of Mem-
bers present at that hour. The sitting
is being wasted in long speeches manu-
factured at Westminster for currency in
Ireland. Personally he does not com-
plain of the persistence of the Irish
Members in marking (with Melancholy)
the sitting as their own. Indeed, by so
doing, they relieve him from embarrass-
ment. But for their insistence the day
might have been utilised for introduc-
tion of the Licensing Bill, that Barme-
cide feast at the Ministerial table. Ever
since Session opened this particular dish
has appeared on the menu. Whenever
Schacabac—represented by C.-B.—has
sat himself down, lifted the cover with
anticipatory gusto, behold the dish was
empty.
“Another day; some day next week,”
says BARMECIDE BALFOUR.
Positively announced for last Tuesday.
Guests assembled hungry, not to say
thirsty. BARMECIDE suddenly discovered
there was another dish must be taken
first. Thibet displaced the Licensing
Bill on the only available day of last
week. But here is Monday, set down
for what is humorously called “getting
the SPEAKER out of the Chair,” on the
Civil Service Estimates. No urgent
necessity in point of time. Gymnastic
operation could be accomplished equally
well on Wednesday.
But the Irish Members have prepared
the speeches aforesaid. The Harp that
once through Tara's halls not been
thrummed for at least three weeks.
Promise extorted from PRINCEARTHUR that
to-day (Monday) should be appropriated
for the performance. Had PARNELL still
been to the fore he would, with poignant
courtesy, have released the belated
PREMIER from his pledge, and pressed
on his acceptance Monday for the pur-
poses of a Bill over which the Cabinet
still wrangled. PARNELL's successor
blunders into threat of what will happen:
if their Monday is taken away from Irish
Members. PRINCE ARTHUR, with a sigh of
relief, says if things are put in that way
he really must keep his pledge. So the
difficulty is evaded; days of grace ex-
tended to Wednesday, when in some
form or other the dish will be ready,
and Schacabac will have chance of gorg-
ing himself.
Odd thing about complicated busi-
ness is that when the long-delayed
delicacy is at length actually placed
on the table there is no one more sure
to regret its appearance, criticise its
composition, than the erstwhile impor-
tunate Schacabac. Meanwhile here is an

afternoon wasted that NANNETTI and
O'Donnell may make speeches, each an
hour long, and REDMOND aimé may wag
a truculent forefinger at an indifferent
Chief Secretary.
Business done.—Chiefly talk.
Tuesday night.—It is eleven years last
February since AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN,
engaging a four-wheeled cab, bade the
driver take the New Cut on his way
to the House, and at one of its many
emporiums freighted the vehicle with
top hats that had seen better days.
Hurrying on to the House he planted
them out on the benches below the
Gangway just as if they were cabbages.
By these means secured priority of
place for what in those days were called
Dissentient Liberals. -
A great deal has happened since
then. To-day the still-young Member
has come to be Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer. Seizes earliest opportunity
to reward the care and loving-kindness
of his parent by increasing taxation on
his cigars.
Rarely since that February day when
Mr. G. expounded his second Home
Rule Bill has House been so crowded.
Four ex-Chancellors of the Exchequer
sat at the feet of GAMALIEL from High-
bury. Jokm peered down from Gallery
over the clock. SQUIRE of MALwooD-CUM-
NUNEHAM reflectively stroked his chin as
he looked across the Table at our new
Financial Minister and, like King GEORGE
with the apple in the dumpling, won-
dered how the well, how he got there.
From his place of exile below the Gang-
way RITCHIE loomed large. Above it sat
St. MICHAEL in the unseen company of
All Angels. Just below RITCHIE, under
the lee of his new leader, HARRY CHAPLIN,
was DoN José, bronzed with foreign
travel, all unconscious at the moment
of the little surprise AUSTEN had in
store for him in the matter of cigars.
An exceptionally embarrassing position
for the début of a CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER. Hard enough for one of
modest mien to face this crowded House;
harder still to meet deficit approaching
five millions sterling. All very well for
JokIM, at the period when GRANDOLPH
“forgot" him, to come into the accus-
tomed heritage of a surplus, legacy of
a Liberal Government. It was AUSTEN's
fate to reach the Treasury after nine
years of continuous Conservative adminis-
tration, and that, as RUDYARD KIPLING
used to say, is another story.
He fronted the ordeal courageously;
neither forward nor affrighted. de no
effort to emulate the eloquence of Mr. G.,
the learning of Mr. Lowe, or the epigrams
of the SQUIRE OF MALwood. In language
unadorned, he lucidly explained his
purpose, adding to the gratitude of the
audience by the comparative brevity of
his discourse. Only time he faltered
was in view of the painful scene between
those eminent tea-dealers, Messrs. Lough
and KEARLEY, when they heard about the
tuppence extra duty on tea. As they
convulsively clasped hands their sobs
filled the tear-dimmed House.
Said Mr. Lough to Mr. KEARLEy,
“'Tis of the Poor I'm thinking merely.”
To Mr. Lough said Mr. K.,
“Yes; I was thinking we'll make 'em pay.”
AUSTEN generously dropped a tear into
an imaginary tea-cup, and passed on to
explain the intricacies of stripped
tobacco.
Business done.-Budget brought in.
A Touching Scene; OR, TUPPENCE ON TEA.
Eminent Tea-dealers (together). “My poor

[Retire sobbing.
Wednesday.—The Licensing Bill at
last! No longer a Barmecide invention;
a substantial joint more or less succu-
lent. AKERS-DOUGLAs, recovered from
depression born of days when he was
locum tenens of the absent Leader,
carries the dish round shoulder high,
for inspection of guests.
As foretold, Schacabac inappeasable;
will have nothing to do with the Bill for
which he of late cried aloud. “I can-
not,” he said, “promise anything but
the most strenuous opposition at every
stage.”
Funnier still attitude and position of
WILFRID Lawson and WHITTAKER. Up to
moment when Home Secretary, standing
at Table, expounded his Bill, no one
knew what it contained. As mere
matter of fact its actuality is a surprise.
In anticipation of debate WILFRID Lawson
had fairly written out some jokes con-
demnatory of the Bill as his imagination
pictured it. Similarly WHITTAKER in the
seclusion of his study had with same
design drafted a new Almanack. And
here was the provoking Home Secretary
bringing in quite another Bill.
That, however, an immaterial detail.
WILFRID worked off his jokes and
WHITTAKER read pages from his Almanack,
just as if the Bill had been what they
imagined, not what habile Ministers,
endeavouring to walk on both sides of
the road at the same time, had drafted.
Business done. — Licensing Bill
brought in.
THE LADIES COLUMN.
ABOUT Town.
SEVERAL ladies have chosen this week
for taking walks. As I was poppin
down Bond Street a few days ago
nearly ran into sweet Lady B., who was
dressed in the softest brown, with a dear'
little robin redbreast perched lovingly in
her toque, which was a veritable dernier
cri. . There is a beautiful story in con-
nection with the little dickey, as Lady B.
believes that it is the same little
feathered darling she used to feed with
crumbs on her window-sill last winter'
It is such a joy to her tender heart to
feel that her #. pensioner will now
never be parted from his benefactress—
while the toque lasts.
A few minutes later, while I was
returning the Countess of A.'s bow, I
caught my foot in the marabout of one
of our most unconventional and witty
American visitors, who is, by the way,
the heroine of the following delightful
little story. While staying at a country
house, not a hundred miles from a
certain , little white village with red
roofs, the house party was taken to a
local flower show. At dinner that
evening, charming Miss X., who was a
member of the party, was asked by her
partner if she took an interest in
gardening. “I guess I'm only interested
in strawberry leaves!” was the witty
answer.
Books To MATCH ALL DRESSEs.
All lovers of literature will be delighted
to hear that Miss CUMBERLAND SMITH's
latest work, Chained by Circumstance,
is to be issued in tooled green leather to
match the dainty little belts which are
being shown this week by Mr. PETER
JAY. This book would look particularly
well with a white satin Liberty robe, a
stole of Indian work, and the hair
coiffured in the mode retroussé, which
is now, we are glad to see, once more
with us.
Another little gem for book lovers is
certainly Lady M.'s wonderfully realistic
Revelations of Revolt, bound in crimson
and black. No brunette should be
without it. To with this beautiful
volume we ºãº recommend
a simple Empire costume of crimson
panne, with deep frills of accordion-
pleated white chiffon, edged with black
ruching, with sprays of crimson chrysan-
themums falling to the feet.
CITY AND SUBURBAN NotE LAst WEEK.— .
“Dean Swift” wasn't quite up to his
name. At all events the Dean wasn't
Swift enough, as he only came in second,
with Robert le Diable in front of him :
The very deuce! and this race wasn't
to the Swift.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FREE CONVERSATION.
THE Daily Chronicle, of April 15,
stated that “The reception of Mr. HENRY
NoFMAN, M.P., by the TSAR . . . was of
an entirely private character, for Mr.
NoRMAN was not introduced by our Am-
bassador or by any official personage,
and the audience, which lasted over half
an hour . . . was conducted, by His
Majesty's wish, with complete freedom
of speech on either side. The TsAR
began by saying that he had read Mr.
Norman's book, kept it in his private
library, and found it the best and fairest
account in English of his own country.
Of course, Mr. NoFMAN does not intend
to publish this interesting conversation.”
Mr. Punch thoroughly appreciates the
nice instinct for reticence shown by
Mr. NoFMAN in respect to the details
of his Imperial interview; and, if the
facts have nevertheless leaked out, the
public must draw its own conclusions
as to the system of key-hole intrigue
that obtains in the TsAR's immediate
entourage.
SCENE–The TsAR's Library.

Nicholas II. I have read your book.
I keep it in my private library. I find
it the best and fairest account yet written

And did you read that very ingenious
feuilleton in the Daily Mail, called
“Mr. Smith, of England”?
H. N. I read the Chronicle
N. II. What a pity you missed that!
The author is a Mr. ANDREw LoRING.
Now, if only he would call upon me!
H. N. I doubt if he is a publicist.
N. II. That is what I meant. Is | Good
there not a bill now interesting your

N. II. I was wondering if he could

and introduce cricket among my mou-

J H. N. The claims of the English
season are very exacting.
N. II. Ah, well, it was only an idea
of mine, perhaps Quixotic.
H. N. There has always been a Quix-
otic strain in the Romanoffs.
N. II. Yes, indeed.
H. N. Japan—?
N. II. Oh, by the way, is the interest
in London in Russian music still what
it was? We look upon your great con-
ductor Mr. HENRY J. TREE as one of the
best of the English friends of Russia.
H. N. Not HENRY J. TREE, your
Majesty; HENRY J. Wood. Perhaps a
not unnatural confusion. We have a
TREE too, an actor. He played in an
adaptation of TolsTOI's novel Resur-
rection.
N. II. Ah, yes. How foolish to con-
fuse the names. But I often do not feel
sure of them. Let me see, you are Sir
ALFRED HARMsworth, are you not?
H. N. No, your Majesty; Mr. HENRY
NoRMAN, M.P.
N. II. Tut, tut, how gauche of me!
Mr. NorMAN, of course, You have been
here before, have you not?
H. N. I am esteemed in England
greatly on account of my intimacy wit
your Majesty. -
N. II. Quite right, quite right. And
what was the purpose of the present
visit?
H. N. A few words on the situation,
your Majesty.
N. II. The situation ? Ah, yes. Charm-
ing, is it not? The view from this
window always seems to me exception-
ally fortunate. And now I must say

MMEDIATELY, detached country or seaside
cottage, with accommodation for sixfowls;
two sitting, three or four bed-rooms; con-
venient to Roman Catholic Church.
The above, appearing in a weekly
lady's paper, shows the status to which
the barn-door fowl is rising. The two
sitting-rooms are of course euphemistic
for the nests, and perches now take the
more refined designation of bedrooms.
But why “convenient to Roman Catholic
Church’? Surely where Brahmas or
Cochin Chinas are concerned a Temple
to Vishnu, Siva, or Buddha would be
more in keeping.

G0NSOLATIONS FOR THE UNHUNG.
Now that the painful month of sus-
nse in Studioland is at an end, it
hoves us to apply our most soothing
embrocation to the wounded feelings
of geniuses whose works have boomer-
anged their way back from Burlington
House. Let them remember:
That very few people really look at
the pictures in the Academy—they only
go to meet their friends, or to say they
have been there.
That those who do examine the works
of art are wont to disparage the same
by way of showing their superior smart-
IneSS.
That one picture has no chance of
recognition with fourteen hundred others
shouting at it.
That all the best pavement-artists
now give “One-Man” shows. They
can thus select their own “pitch,” and
are never ruthlessly skied.
That photography in colours is coming,
and then the R.A. will have to go.
That REMBRANDT, Holben, RUBENs and
WANDYCK were never hung at the Summer
Exhibition.
That BottiCELLI, CoRREGGIo and TITIAN
managed to rub along without that
privilege.
That the ten-guinea frame that was
bought (or owed for) this spring will do
splendidly next year for another master-
piece.
That the painter must have specimens
of his best work to decorate the somewhat
bare walls of his studio.
That the best test of a picture is being
able to live with it—or live it down—so
why send it away from its most lenient
critic?
That probably the chef-d'oeuvre sent
in was shown to the Hanging Committee
upside down. ”
That, supposing they saw it pro-
perly, they were afraid that its suc-
cess would put the Academy to the
expense of having a railing placed in
front.
And finally, we would remind the
Rejected One that, after all, his bantling
has been exhibited in the R.A.—to the
President and his colleagues engaged
in the work of selection. Somebody
at least looked at it for quite three
seconds.
A Rapid Glance Round.
THE following advertisement of an
Isle of Wight Hotel appears in the St.
James's Gazette :-

M. BOUDIN IN ENGLAND.
No. III.
Of course I have seen to it that young Boudn should pay
a visit to the House of Commons; indeed, I went with him,
for I was anxious to note what impression was made upon
him by the sight of the institution which is at once the
cause and guardian of our liberties and the promoter of our
progress. “Boudin,” I said to him, “I am glad to tell you
that I have been able, through the d offices of my friend
WINDLESTRAP, the Member for East Wopsall, to secure cards
for the Strangers' Gallery of the House of Commons to-day.
I hope it will be convenient for you to go.”
“Convenient?” he replied. “Oh, yes, I can make it
convenient, but I do not know that I am enthusiast for the
House of Commons. I have seen the Chamber of Deputies
and I suppose they are much alike. They are old gentlemen
with bald heads that shine as you look down at them; and

I own that this way of putting it affected me disagreeably,
but I kept calm and said, “The Chamber of Deputies, my
dear Boudin, is no doubt all very well in its ."# I am
the last man to say a word against it; but the House of
Commons is the oldest representative assembly in the world,
the mother of Parliaments, and all that, you know, and—
well, we're accustomed to think of it as something rather
different from other bodies of a similar nature set up by
foreign nations.”
“As to that,” says he, “I do not doubt it will be different
in little things, but in principle they are all the same. And
to be old is not to be full of wisdom; but I will go with

matter of no importance.
However, I took him in spite of his flippancy.
We were lucky in our evening, for the adjournment of the
House was moved from the Opposition benches almost
immediately after we got there, forty Members having risen
to support the orator who proposed it, and the debate that
ensued was one of the liveliest and angriest it has ever been
lting down
like hailstones; eyes flashed; fists were clenched; there were
interruptions, roars of fury, retorts, pale faces—all the signs
in fact that denote a situation strained almost to bursting-
int. I had the utmost difficulty in restraining BoudLN from
joining in the uproar and thus causing our expulsion from
the Gallery:-
“It is not human,” he said, “to prevent me from shouting.
I smother if I do not shout. Oh, sacred name of a pipe, it is
better than the Chamber of Deputies; it is better than the
battle of Austerlitz at the Cirque; it is better—oh, but that
was a terrible thing your Mr. BALFOUR say of your Sir BANNER-
MAN; and yet you say there will be no duels after this.”
“My dear BoupDN,” I said with some dignity, “in a coun
which has long been in the enjoyment of liberty, and whic
has realised that progress depends on free and open dis-
cussion, there is no necessity to resort to the brutal and
senseless arbitrament of the duel. We have got beyond that
sort of thing. We do not bring political animosity into the
field of private friendship. I myself agree with Mr. BALFOUR
and the Conservative Press that the Liberals on the Opposi-
tion are, with few exceptions, a set of unprincipled scoundrels,
the friends of every country except their own—but I should
be sorry to let this opinion of mine break up my private
intercourse with Liberals.”

Of course I laughed at him, but for once in a way he

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE. -
In spite of the fact that readers of The Woman with the
Fan ) will not make the acquaintance of a single
desirable person, Mr. Robert HICHENS’ book is
fascinating by reason of its clever studies of
character, iii. in the drama it unfolds.
It is always a pity that good people should
not be capable of becoming, in the skilled
novelist's hands, as interesting as the bad.
My Baronite's limited experience does not
bring him in contact with the exceedingly
seamy side of highly-placed London society
familiar to Mr. HICHENs. All his men are bad (with the ex-
ception of a feeble old gentleman whose physical infirmities
are pitilessly dwelt j and all his women (save one septua-
genarian) are in varied manner vicious. Nevertheless one
eagerly reads what they say, and intently follows their
plotting and counterplotting. Amongst many finished
studies is the character of Lord Holme, a sort of twentieth
century Bacchus, with a touch of Silenus. Robin Pierce, a
discarded suitor of Lady Holme who openly makes love to her
in her married state, is the nearest approach to a gentleman
in Mr. HICHENs' gallery. But this character is evidently
imposed upon him with ulterior design. It helps to make
the strongly dramatic situation in which Robin, after
passionately protesting that Lady Holme's beauty is nothing
to him, all i. sought being “the angel within her,” discovers
that her face has been disfigured by an accident, and silently
turns away and withdraws from the stage. There are other
scenes that suggest dramatisation of the novel. But of course
Lady Holme's scarred and seamed countenance, upon which
the tragedy turns, makes such adaptation impossible.
Miss Arnott's Marriage, by RICHARD MARSH (John LoNG),
can be recommended by the Baron only to the totally inex-
perienced in novel-reading, or to the thoroughly accomplished
and indefatigable skipper conversant with the ropes. The
story begins well; and thus it happens that the commence-
ment is the best of it, “which,” quoth the Baron paradoxi-
cally, “is just the very worst of it.”
In the Editor's preface to Haydn's Dictionary of Dates
(WARD, Lock & Co.) record is made of the death of Mr. BENJAMIN
VINCENT, which took place since he piloted
through the press the twenty-second edition
of this indispensable work. Behold in this
portly volume his unique monument. Mr.
VINCENT commenced his editorial labours in
connection with the seventh edition, and
continued them through the last hitherto
published. The twenty-third exceeds former
records by two hundred precious pages, not to mention space
gained by condensation, printing in smaller type, or the
expunging of matters of lessening interest. As it stands the
volume is world-embracing. There is no subject, from Atoms
to Zollverein, that is not dealt with compendiously yet com-
prehensively. The art of condensation reaches its perfection
in these Hilº pages. Not only is the history of
every nation in the universe brought up to date, but where,
since the last edition was published, history has been made,
place is found for succinct record. Turning over the pages
my Baronite finds not less than ten devoted to record of the
progress of the South African War. In this narrow compass
are found, instantly accessible, particulars and dates of every
one of the leading incidents in the Titanic struggle. The
Dictionary of Dates is for the literary or business man a
library in itself.
The Tragedy of the Great Emerald, by WETHERby CHESNEY
(METHUEN), is the story of a robbery, two murders, a suicide,
and the discovery of criminals without any assistance being
given by...professional detectives and subordinate police
officers. The gentleman and the lady who undertake the
detection of the above indicated crimes are not by any
means strikingly original creations. The one really strong
melodramatic situation arrests attention at the commence:
ment of the story, but “subsequent proceedings” are not
of increasing interest. The pace at first is too good to
last : hence disappointment. Still, those whom Providence
has blessed with an abundance of spare time may set them-
selves many a less profitable task j. the perusal of this
tale of meddle, muddle, and mystery.
Dr. BARRY is a master of perplexing style. My Baronite,
reading Newman, the latest addition to the Literary Lives
Series published by HopDER AND STOUGHTON, feels the touch
of nature that makes him kin with the coster's acquaintance
of the Old Kent Road, “’E dunno were 'e are.” Frequently
he comes upon really illuminating sentences, and thinks he
is now going to learn something about the Cardinal, his life
and his works. But the next sentence, obscure, involved, has
nothing to do with the matter, wandering blindfold on
another tack. At best it is a lay figure round which the
book is written—a pity, since there have been few personalities
so rich and rare as that of the English Cardinal. The best
things in the book are the various photogravures, from the
miniature painted whilst NEWMAN was still in residence at
Keble College to the Dantesque face presented a year before
his death, with its pathetic gaze into an unknown future,
and its unspoken prayer, “Lead, Kindly Light.”
Bright in colour is the frontispiece of the Pall Mall
Magazine for May, which opens with a poem entitled “A
Summer Evening,” by King OSCAR of Sweden and Norway.
The translation of the Royal contributor's work is by EMILY
JULIAN. There are some capital cricket notes, headed “Don't.”
aptly illustrated: MAUD RAwson's story of “Pepita” is dash-
ingly illustrated by S. H. SIME, who introduces a new
method of dealing with the action of individuals in the tale
by showing a page of curiously quaint landscape (in a cer.
tain sense Gustave Dorésque), wherein hundreds of trees
appear like gigantic powdered heads of goblins in a valley,
while the two principal actors in the scene are in the fore.
ground, proportionately insig-
nificant. Then in the next
illustration we are shown how
“he stood facing Pepita with
flashing eyes,” but the spectator
sees only the broad back of the
gentleman facing Pepita, and
whether his eyes are flashing
or not cannot be gathered
from their reflection in those of
Pepita. A lively and interest-
ing number, as it should be
for “The merry month of
May.”
SHORT Notice.—On this occasion Mr. Punch's Dramatic
Commissioner can do no more for The Rich Mrs. Repton,
the new comedy produced last week at the Duke of York's
Theatre, than record the instant and well-deserved success
of Mr. R. C. CARTON's wealthy widow. It is a delightful piece,
capitally “staged” by Mr. Dion Boucicault, and perfectly
acted. The eccentric heroine, Mrs. Jack Repton, a modern
Lady Bountiful, is charmingly impersonated by Miss Compton.
Congratulations to Manager CHUDLEIGH and to all concerned;

STORM IN A TEACUP.
UNDER a hide profoundly elephantine,
To Nature's touches practically dead,
He hid a heart inhuman, adamantine,
Who lightly thought to tax the people's bread;
But he, I hold, possessed a constitution
Tougher by one incredible degree,
Who faced a country ripe for revolution
And put an extra tuppence on its tea.
What made him choose a course so rash, so risky?
Why pinch a people in its tenderest place?
Was it the falling-off in wine and ...
That asked revenge in kind to meet the case?
Are we conjecturally right in stating
That he has j that sacred cup,
The sort that #. without inebriating, -
Merely to make the liquid difference up?
To him, I dare surmise, it little mattered,
So he could once restore the year's decrease,
Whether or not that tuppence rudely shattered
The dearest prop of our domestic peace;
That charm that in the mansions of the mighty
Makes bearable the women's gossip-hour;
The same that in the humbler form of “high-tea”
Draws home the clerk to his suburban bower.
I would some friend, some Treasury Achates
Had warned him not to put our tempers out
By carelessly upsetting those Penates
Who find their focus in the tea-pot's spout;
Had bid him mark that best of Britain's mottos,
Which, like her flag (to every wind unfurled),
Elicits loyal cheers and reverent “What ohs' "-
The hand that rules the kettle rocks the world!
For not by beer alone, nor yet at Eton
(The site where Waterloo was largely won),
Have we acquired the knack of being łº,
Without acknowledging when we are done;
But half our gallantry in earth- and sea-fights,
And that unrivalled gift of keeping cool,
Was learned in hand-to-mouth provincial tea-fights
Inaugurated by the Sunday School.
And what associations round it ripple,
The beverage that genii loved to gulp !
CowPER, whose Muse immortalised the tipple,
Grew nightly pensive o'er its sodden pulp;
On this, to cope with Boswell's deadly tedium,
The champion lexicographer relied;
WEIR drew his mellow note from just this medium,
And ANNE absorbed it freely—ere she died.
And if to-day we must forego that liquor
Which binds the nation as in bonds of blood—
Thicker than water anyhow, and thicker,
If you but leave it long enough, than mud;
When on the storied urn we used to brew in
We carve the dying record of the free,

By putting tuppence extra on her tea! O. S.
“THE visit of M. LouBET,” says a Times correspondent,
“confirms and symbolises the French recognition of Roma
intangibile capitale d'Italia.” “What's the use of an
‘intangible capital?’” asked a well-informed speculator on
hearing the above. “One can't take much interest in it, or
A PLEASANT EVENING.
This can be insured in the company of The Rich Mrs.
Repton at the Duke of York's Theatre. Mr. CARTON's sweet
widow is able to draw cheques to any amount, so may she
draw the public. Mrs. Repton is a woman with a queer past,
but ever ready with a splendid present. So good a character
could not have a better representative than Miss CoMPTON.
Mr. CHARLES ALLAN is excellent as an Anglican Bishop, also
“with a past,” at least so he gives the audience to infer from
his uncommonly precise bearing in the presence of a lady
whose morality he considers somewhat questionable. As his
nephew, Lord Charles Dorchester, Mr. A. E. MATTHEws “goes
up” more than “one.” He has a future of light-serious
comedy before him, and this particular part he plays to
perfection.
It is quite on the cards that Mr. CHARLES TRooDE—en-
acting Captain Pugsley, an amateur conjuror—would be a
good remplacant for Mr. MATTHEws whenever required at short
notice. #. has very little to do, but that little is always
effective, and never obtrusive. In the hands of Mr. ERIC
Lewis the absurd character of the kind-hearted niminy-
iminy Bryce Kempshaw, known as “Fluffy,” is very safe.
e brings out all its best points and never exaggerates its
foibles.
Mr. C. M. LowNE gives us a clever sketch of honest
Edward Lurcott, a failure as a barrister.
The one part that might endanger the success of the play
—namely, that of Paul Rance the Dramatist, simply because
the public (a first-night audience excepted) is quite unable to
sympathise with an author in agonies about the production
of his new piece,—is remarkably well rendered, without the
slightest exaggeration, by Mr. DION BoucICAULT.
Capital as is Mr. Dawson Milward's villain, Fitzroy Marrack,
et, is it necessary to make him up as such a ghastly
§oº. rascal? How much more artistic would it have
been were he shown as quite an ordinary-looking individual.
Miss DoRA BARTON as Mrs. F. Marrack does not make this
mistake: from her attractive appearance, her character
might be good, bad, or indifferent: and, when it comes to
business, she never loses a point. This happy couple to
a certain extent resemble DICKENs's Mr. and §. Merdle;
while older readers may be reminded by them of Mr. and
Mrs. Wracketts in ALBERT SMITH's Pottleton Legacy. Mr.
Wracketts is there described as a gentleman very like a
“dissipated eagle;” also “he had a very pale face,” and
his wife “was a very pretty woman, evidently his junior by
ten or twelve years.” Mr. CARTON's swindlers pretty closely
resemble this latter happy couple.
Miss DoRA BARTON is nice as the ingénue Norah Lamonby,
and Miss LENA HALLIDAY enlists all sympathies by her quiet
rendering of Miss Petworth, Mrs. Jack Repton's secretary.
The part of Jowling, Mrs. Jack's highly respectable butler, is
capitally made up and played by Mr. CHARLEs DALY.
he stage, at the present moment, is strong in representa-
tives of upper and lower domestic service: and no piece just
now is complete without a typical butler, footman, and house-
keeper. The smart housemaid of ancient farce and comedy
will have her turn again ; the valet is once more getting
his chance, as witness the Vellamy of Mr. LEwis FIELDER.
The dialogue is epigrammatic and natural; the action, dra-
matic. Whether §. CARTON's play is strong enough for a
long run must depend on “the taste and fancy” of the
somewhat uncertain public.
THE Westminster Gazette, in reviewing the Stratford-on-
Avon performances, says:– “Mr. BENSON has gone back to

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, April 25.-
“I wants to make your flesh creep.”
Thus the Fat Boy known to Mr. Pick-
wick, prefacing communication to his
mistress of the scene in the arbour
between Mr. Tupman and the spinster
aunt. Nothing about the LORD HIGH
CHANCELLOR that suggests the Fat Boy;
nothing save a certain subtle something
in his manner as with dignified, yet
lithe step he paced the floor this after-
noon on his way to the Woolsack.
Attendance small; through it ran quick
apprehension that something direful
.#. to happen. First thought sug-
gested Dissolution. PRINCEARTHUR might,
on further reflection, be disposed to
revert to ancient constitutional practice
of resigning after defeat in the Division
Lobby. But there had been no disasters
of that kind; on the contrary, matters
mightily improving in the other House.
Ministerial majority more than once ran
up to its old figures, even exceeded them.
oreover, if Dissolution were to the fore,
it wouldn't be LORD CHANCELLOR's busi-
ness to announce it.
Could DoN José have been saying or
doing something? Was the LORD CHAN-
CELLOR bearer of a message from him?
If so, would Black Rod be despatched to
other House to request their attendance
at its delivery, whilst in Palace Yard the
Mansion House band played a bar of
“God Save the King”?
That obviously absurd, including
suggested action of band. Never know
what we may come to ; as yet this stage
not reached. Anyhow, something evi-
dently to the fore. Know it by the
quiver of the LORD CHANCELLOR's wig, the
ominous rustling of his silken gown.
Having seated himself on Woolsack,
LoRD CHANCELLOR slowly rose. Fresh
quiver of excitement passed along the
benches. Noble Lords leaned forward
with parted lips. Speaking rather in
sorrow than in anger, LORD CHANCELLOR
told his simple story. Two years ago
CHARLES HENRY CHANDos HENNIKER-MAJOR
succeeded to the British barony of his
ancient house. In no hurry to take his
seat in the Lords. Made no move in
that direction through last Session.
Now occurred to him might as well keep
up family custom. Advised that before
presenting himself to take oath must
possess himself of writ summoning him
to Parliament. Looked in at Crown
Office.
“Don’t happen to have about you
writ for Baron IKER” he enquired.
“HENNIKER-MAJOR, you know. I'm called
Major because I was born in January
and my brother GERALD was born in
December of same year. Odd thing, you
know; doesn't often happen in a family.
ORSTIN, THE TAKER-IN of SHEKELs.
Some idea, I believe, of christening
me Alpha and GERALD Omega. But not
carried out. Yes, you are quite right;
we sit in the Lords as Baron HARTISMERE.
Things altogether a little mixed. But
thought I'd look in for the writ. Thank
you; now it's all right, I suppose. Just
drop in at the Lords, hand in the docu-
ment, sign the roll, and there you are—
at least, there I am.”
So he was on the Tuesday following.
But as it turned out he had no business
there. The clerk at the Crown Office
so interested in HENNIKER-MAJOR's story—
“Quite a romance of the peerage,” he
said to his wife when he returned home
—that, looking up a file and finding
a writ ready for $º HARTISMERE he
handed it over.
Accepted as matter of course by
clerk at table in House of Lords; ALPha
HENNIKER-MAJOR, sixth Baron in the
John of BATTERSEA.
(After the manner of M-x B-rb-hm.)
Peerage of Ireland, second in that of
the United Kingdom, duly signed the
roll of Parliament and took his seat.
Then dread discovery made. It wasn't
his writ at all! HENNIKER-MAJOR's a hap-
hazard family. The fifth Baron went
to his grave without ever possessing
himself of the writ of summons to the
last Parliament of Queen WICTORIA. Long
it lay at the Crown Office, till the sixth
Baron, casually dropping in, dazing
the clerk with entrancing autobiogra-
hical details, gets handed to him his
te father's writ, and but for accidental
discovery might (legislatively) have lived
upon it to the end of the chapter.
As it is, the Constitution must be
saved. Instant action imperative. Thus
the LORD CHANCELLOR comes down in
State and, setting aside all other busi-
ness, moves that the writ of summons
directing Lord HARTISMERE to attend be
set aside. Also that the name of Lord
HARTISMERE, set forth among the Lords
#. on Tuesday last, should be
eleted, and that the signature on the
test-roll be struck out. -
Noble Lords held their breath expect-
ing the LORD CHANCELLOR would conclude
dread sentence with the formula, “And
may the Lord have mercy on your soul!”
Stopped short at that; and noble Lords,
feeling unequal to strain of other busi-
mess, forthwith adjourned.
Business done.—In Commons, oppo- |
sition to Aliens Bill defeated by a |
majority of 124. In Lords, Lord
HENNIKER declared to be an alien. Name
struck off roll of Parliament—pro tem. of
course.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—A dull ||
day, my masters. Nothing to the fore
more important than voting in Committee
of Ways and Means a trifle of one ||

ling. Not at any time present through
discussion one hundred and thirty-four

GREAT GOLFERS.
A SERIES OF APPRECIATIONS.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. G. W. Beldam.)
THE DUKE of DEVONSHIRE.
Now we come to a player whom many
consider to be gifted by nature with the
most remarkable style in the Kingdom
of Golf—an opinion in which I decidedly
concur, for to see the Duke of DEVONSHIRE
hitting hard with his wooden clubs is a
sight for the gods. Some of the feats
he has recently accomplished on the
private links at Chatsworth are alto-
gether unprecedented: on one occasion
when ſº a full-iron shot he cut
what BEN SAYERS (no mean judge) de-
clares to be the largest divot on record.
It is said that when he is playing with
the Hon. OSMOND Scott he is consistently
out-driven, but I have never seen Lord
HALSBURY drive a ball quite so far as the
Chatsworth crack.
The Duke of DEVONSHIRE, as instan-
taneous photographs show, adopts an
extraordinarily . stance—there being
fully three and a half feet between his
feet—with the ball placed equidistant
from the two heels, so that it is impos-
sible to say for certain whether he plays
off the right or the left leg. Another
peculiarity of his is that he never fails to
strike his shoulder, neck or head with
the club-head at the top of his swing.
The follow through is just as full of
dash as the upward swing, as may be
#. from the fact that the Duke has
n known to strike the ground eighteen
inches behind the ball, and yet succeed
in striking it several yards off the teel
But his proficiency is by no means con-
fined to his wooden clubs. With his
mashie, when he is in form, the Duke
can socket, dunch and flub against any
amateur living, and Lord DARNLEY, better
known as the Hon. Ivo BLIGH, has been
heard to say that he has never seen any
golfer make such a stroke to cover point.
MR. Joseph CHAMBERLAIN.
If there is one player who may be said
to have a distinctive style of his own, it
is the ex-Colonial º To begin
with, in addressing the ball he entirely
dispenses with any preliminary waggle.
His somewhat slight physique affords no
criterion of his driving power, which is
quite remarkable. But perhaps his most
striking characteristic is his daring yet
successful use of that difficult yet de-
lightful shot—the push-stroke. Gene-
y º it is only used when the
ground is firm; but no matter how diffi-
cult the lie, or how delicate the ground,
Mr. IN can always rely on
bringing it off with a certainty which
paralyses the most flºº. oppo-
nent.
Another great service which Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN has rendered to the game
is the revival of the spoon. Time was
when the driving mashie was the popular
favourite. It had dethroned the cleek,
as the latter club had superseded the
spoon; but the spoon is once again
amongst us, and I firmly believe has
come to stay. It is a club to which
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, like Mr. HILTON and
SANDY HERD, is peculiarly partial, but
in one important particular he differs
from these famous exponents of the
game. . They always use a short club,
while he varies the length of his spoon
according to the character of his partner.
SIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN.
The peculiarities of the Liberal
Leader's style are pronounced and easily
described. Time after time he uncon-
sciously “faces” in an entirely different
direction from that in which he intends
to go, with a result to his partner that
can be easily imagined. It is said,
however, that of late he has been assidu-
ously practising a forcing stroke with a
captive ball in a Chinese compound, and
his present style would certainly tend to
.#. this rumour. In addressing his
ball he favours a prolonged waggle, and
leaves a good deal to be desired in
regard to the follow through. He is
generally considered what is termed a
left-leg player, but observation of his
recent methods inclines us to the *P.
sition that he has altered slightly his
attitude to the globe, with the result
that he is not quite so much of a left-
leg player as he was.
It appears from the account given in
the Times of the attempt to assassinate
General KUROPATRIN, that a Cossack in
attendance on the Commander-in-Chief
noticed one of the two Japanese, “dis-
guised as Chinese beggars, put his hand
inside his dress, whereupon he felled
him to the ground.” Exceptionally
sharp body-guard this. . It recalls the
case “down west” when a simple
stranger, on putting his hand behind
him, to draw out his handkerchief from
his tail pocket, was immediately shot by
the Arkansas gentleman of whom he was
about to ask the way. Still the Cossack
was right this time—if the story's true.

RHYMES OF THE EAST.
A SoLDIER OF WEIGHT.
IN the dim and distant ages, in the half-forgotten days,
Ere the East became the fashion, and an Indian tour the craze,
Lived a certain Major-General, renowned throughout the State
As an officer of standing and considerable weight.
But, though weightiness of mind is an invaluable trait,
When referred to adiposity it's all the other way;
And our hero was afflicted with an ever growing lack
Of the necessary charger, and the hygienic hack.
He had bought them by the dozen—he had tried them by
the score, L
But not one of them was equal to the burden that he bore;
They were conscious of the honour—they were sound in
wind and limb– -
They could carry a cathedral, but they drew the line at him.
But he stuck to it, till finally his pressing needs were filled
By the mammoth of his species, a Leviathan in build,
A superb upstanding brown, of unexceptionable bone,
And phenomenally qualified to carry 20 stone.
And the General was happy; for awhile the creature showed
An unruffled acquiescence in the nature of his load;
Till without the slightest warning that superb upstanding
brown
Thought it time to make a protest, which he did by lying
down.
They appealed to him, reproached him, gave him sugar, cut
his feed,
But in vain; for almost daily that inexorable steed,
When he heard his master coming, looked insultingly around,
And with cool deliberation laid him down upon the ground.
But they fought it out, till in the end the undefeated brute
Made a humorous obeisance at the general salute!
Then his owner kicked him wildly in the stomach for his
pranks,
Said he'd stand the beast no longer, and “returned him to
the ranks.”

(An interval of about three years has elapsed.)
Time has dulled our hero's anguish; time has moved our
man of weight
To an even higher office in the service of the State;
And we find him on his yearly tour, inspecting at his ease
A distinguished corps of Cavalry, the Someone's Own D.G.'s.
And our fat but famous man of war, accoutred to the nines,
Was engaged in making rude remarks, and going round the
lines,
When he suddenly beheld across an intervening space
A Leviathan of horseflesh, the Behemoth of his race.
“Colonel Robinson,” he shouted, with enthusiastic force,
“A remarkably fine horse, Sir!” The remarkably fine horse
Gave a reminiscent shudder, looked insultingly around,
And with cool deliberation laid him down upon the ground !
DUM-DUM.

OUR MR. JABBERJEE IN THE FAR EAST.
III.
Still in Korea—but higher up.
April 8.
SINCE my last date of writing I have figured as a some:
what prominent fly on the wheel of international politics!
This may perhaps appear almost too bombastical an
assertion, even for the emissary of so potential a factor
as Hon’ble Punch; still, like Othello, I have done the State
some service, and they know it, so I need say no more of
that—except to narrate how it all transpired.
As the fanatical admirer of my plucky little Jap cronies,
I have been deeply mortified to perceive that their Korean
entertainers, far from showing them their super-fatted
calves, kept them at the arm's length of a cold shoulder;
such boycutting tactics being due to the bad example of His
Imperial Korean Majesty, who adopted the strictly neutral
and ostrichian attitude of pretending to be unconscious of
their nude existence!
I was anxious to intervene as the mutual friend to split
their difference—but que faire? For the Korean EMPEROR is
unhappily of such excessively sequestered and unsociable
disposition that, whenever he makes the shortest promenade
through the streets, the populace are strictly forbidden to
witness the procession, even from their windows, and any
such Peeping. ToM is unceremoniously launched into the
Coventry of Eternity! -
And ". courtiers also are compelled to turn their backs,
and remain sotto voce, without so much as a hiccup, while his
soldiers must carry small sticks in their mouths to evade all
suspicion of loquacity.
oreover, he is so sensitive to criticism that when, for
some offence or other, he had ordered one of his sisters-in-
law to be roasted to death in a brazen apartment, and a
certain Governor had hazarded the obiter dictum that this
was rather too ungallant behaviour towards a member of the
fair sex, his Majesty not only ordered the said Governor's
head to be decapitated, but that his shins were subse-
uently to receive twenty strokes from a bastinadol [Ed.
$.". cannot permit our Correspondent to libel a most
humane and amiable monarch in this way. This particular
Court scandal will be found recorded in HAMEL’s “Account
of a Visit to Korea”—published about two hundred years ago!
Wide Pinkerton's Voyages, Vol. VII. Mr. J. must really be
more careful as to the references he consults in future.]
Under these circumstances I naturally hesitated before ven-
turing even my tip of nose in such a Cave of Despair as
the Imperial Palace!
But, most fortunately, a friendly Yang-ban, or member of
the Korean Upper Ten [ED. CoM.—We are bound to admit
that, on consulting an authority, we find that “Yang-ban"
may be translated “gentry”], gave me the valuable advice
that if I desired an audience from the King, I must curry
myself into warm favour with a certain Lady Hm, who was
the light of his imperial optics.
Needless to state that I at once took measures to ascertain
the length of her foot, and very soon succeeded in rendering
her my friend in Court.
Lady Hm is a matronly Begum of imposing obesity, with
a sallow visage, and liquid organs of vision which do not
hunt in couples. She is of highly susceptible temperament,
and, if I may credit the ondits of Korean hoi pollies, pos-
sesses a past of a rather luridly spicy character.
The ordinary reticence of an Indo-Anglian gentleman of
course suppresses me to indicate the precise sentiments with
which she regarded myself.
However, some of your readers may perhaps remember a cer-
tain celebrated Indian romance, in which the hero (Mr. Bhosh)
was put out of his countenance by the too forward advances
of the Duchess of Dickinson. The incident in question was,
I happen to know, drawn more or less correctly from the
Author's personal experiences. It is notoriously waste of
time to nod and beck with wreathed smiles at a wilfully
blind horse, and I will restrict myself to the discreet hint that
such a history may possibly have once more repeated itself.
. Nevertheless, I must do Lady Hm the justice that, so soon
as she was convinced by the inflexible prudery of my
demeanour that she was a Moth who was hopelessly out of
my Star, she did not exhibit any of the vindictive felinities of
coroneted European feminines, but, on the contrary, put up
with my friendship on strictly Plutonic principles.
In token of same she most kindly undertook the jobbery
of presenting me at the Palace as a distinguished stranger.
P shall not attempt to describe the gorgeous sumptuosities
of its gilded saloons [ED. CoM.—Why not?] beyond affirming
that the interior is truly magnificent, if perhaps in too
barbaric a style for cultured Western Tottenham Court Road
taste
Stooping in order to make a conquest, I imprinted my
chaste salute upon the imperial foot to the solemn accom-
paniment of a stroke on the gong.
Then, erecting myself to my full stature, I said, with
modest self-sufficiency: “Rindly excuse this intrusion, since
I am here for the strictly business purpose of patching up a
very old sore.”
And, perceiving that His Majesty did not tip the wink to
any executioner, but seemed willing to allow me my head, I
proceeded to address him through the medium of an inter-
preter, who, however, was of such gross incompetency as to
convey my fecundity in wretchedly bald laconisms.
I said it was the thousand pities that so enlightened and
É. a Potentate, in lieu of perceiving which was the
uttered side of his bread, should be so inordinately paralysed
by Yellow Perils as to remain a mere mugwump. #. .
the Emperor responded that he was by no means in love with
the Japanese, whom he regarded as so many unmitigated
nuisances.
“Still,” I argued, “why, O intimate connection of the Sun
and Moon, why snub individuals who are engaged in moving
Heaven and Earth to prevent the double-headed and Pro-
methian Eagle from praying over your internal economies?
Is not said Eagle at the present moment lying, like dog-in-
manger, in Port Arthur, and is Hon’ble Admiral Toko, with
all his abilities, a Canute that he is to command the sea
without assistance?”
His Majesty rather grumpily replied that the Japanese
were already overflowing their footwear, and that, having
himself a many-wintered crow to pluck with them, he would
not be sorry to see them denuded of some of their stuffing.
“Do not, hon’ble EMPEROR,” I implored of him, “neglect
such an A1 "Pºº to heap coals of fire on their unde-
serving nuts! Why should such a first-class Navy as yours sit
on the fence between the deep sea and a foreign devil, when
it might be sent, with a magnanimous message, to your
hon’ble Cousin the MIKADo, and contribute a Kºid.
brutum fulmen to the bombardment of Port Arthur?”
For a while he made rather ominous apologies for the
rough-and-tumble accommodation of his imperial torture-
chamber, which suspended me on tenderhooks—until I had
the unexpected felicity to gather that I had gained my point.
Bursting into lachrymation, he summoned thirty of his
Rear-Admirals, who made their reverential entry on all fours
[ED. CoM.–It seems that the actual number of Korean
Admirals is twenty-three], and ordered that, unless the Navy
set its sails for Port Arthur by sunset, every Admiral was to
be flown as pennant from his own yard-arm.

one iron-built coal-lighter] was under its
weight, and I think I may fairly claim
that if it should prove, in very short
space of time, to turn the scale in the
balances of Naval Power—it is entirely
owing to my agency.
After a little tittle-tattle on topics of
the day, His Majesty graciously dis-
missed me, with the handsome present
of a roll of silk and a fan, which I am
sending home to my family circles.
This diplomatical success (which surely
adds an extra feather to the cap and
bells of my revered Lord Paramount)
emboldens me to put in a petition on
º purely personal hook: I find that
all my journalistic-rivals are equipping
themselves with patent wireless tele-
graphic poles.

beastly shame if so peerless a paper as
Punch were to be less up-to-date than
penny or half-penny periodicals, may I

say, £50), which is surely an incon-

To take as a serious man

When the sound of them falls on your ear.

[May 4, 1904.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S TEST.S.
THAT the literary profession is over-
crowded is generally agreed, and it is
likely to become more so unless some
steps are taken to keep down the new-
comers. At the request of the Committee
of the Athenaeum Club and the Society
of Authors, Mr. Punch has drawn up a
number of Entrance-Examination papers,
from which he gives below a selection of
questions. Unless these questions are
satisfactorily answered the candidate
must continue to be a mere barrister or ||
schoolgirl, curate or civil servant.
DRAMATIST PAPER.
The plums of the writing profession
going now to the authors of successful
Fº it follows that every child would
a dramatist. Six questions from the
entrance paper for playwrights are sub-
joined, and only on answering four of
them with éclat will the candidate be
allowed to continue at his MS.:—
1. Assumed that your play has been
produced without catcalls, from which
of the following conditions would you
augur most success?
(a) Sprightliness in the Times; dis-
approval in the Telegraph.
(b) Sarcasm in the Times; rapture in
the Telegraph.
(c) W. A.'s confession in the World
that he had slept.
2. Define melofarce. Give specimens
of dialogue proper to (a) musical comedy,
(b) comic opera, (c) melofarce, illustrat-
ing the differentia of each class.
3. Supposing that, having been com-
missioned to write a musical comedy, you
spent eight hours over the plot and
dialogue, how long should it take your
six rhyming confederates to write the
lyrics?
4. Do you think lyric a good word
to describe these things? Suggest
another.
5. The word “damn" having shown
signs of late that it is losing its old
drawing power on the stage, what would
you substitute? Confine your selection
to six expletives.
6. Give your reasons for believing
in the j for a School for Actor-
Managers too.
EDITOR PAPER.
Editors are supposed to be born and
not made—their one point of resem-
blance to poets. But Mr. Punch would
have them examined too. Here are a
couple of questions:-
1. Given the need for a circulation-
reviving serial at short notice, state the
order in which, you would apply to the
following novelists:–
Mr. FREDERIO HARRISON.
Mr. ANDREw LoRING.
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD.
Mr. G. K. ChestERTON.
2. Given the need for a special
middle article on anything, in what
order would you apply to the following
ready pens?
Mr. CHIOzzA Money.
. HAROLD BEGBIE.
.ANDREW LANG.
. G. K. CHESTERTON.
. HENRY NoFMAN, M.P.
Mr. BART KENNEDY.
REVIEWER PAPER.
Reviewers similarly are supposed, like
Minerva, to spring into the arena fully
armed, either from Oxford, Cambridge
or Scotland. But here again the ex-
aminer steps in.
1. Say whether in your opinion a
reviewer should learn more from his
author or an author from his reviewer.
Much depends on your answer.
2. Take the necessary discount off
the following phrases:–
(1) Mr. — may now be said to have
arrived.
(2) The book bears the mark of dis-
tinction on every page.
(3) This edition is definitive.
(4) A work of genius.
3. Say what is wrong in the fol-
lowing sentence: “Neither Mr. GLAD-
STONE nor Mr. CHAMBERLAIN were able to
completely fool all the people all the
time.” hat punishment would you
recommend, from your high position as
a critic, for the wretch so abandoned as
to pen such enormities?
NOWELIST PAPER.
In spite of the overcrowded market,
novelists are continually arriving, like
Ostend rabbits, or leaves in Wallombrosa.
There is now a new novel for every
hour of the day; there will soon be one
for every minute—unless, that is, the
difficulty offered by these three import-
ant questions is a deterrent.
1. Give some idea of the paralysis of
the art of fiction that would ensue if
Bridge were forbidden by law.
2. The Man with the Single Spat.
Devise a scenario for this title in the
manner of (a), Sir A. ConAN Doyle,
§ Mr. CoNRAD, (c)Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT,
Mr
Mr
Mr
Mr
MARK RUTHERFORD.
3. ELIZABETH is said to have had her
day as a heroine's name. What would
you substitute?
ART CRITIC PAPER.
Here are two leading questions for
would-be art critics:
1. What is your idea of the terms of
the Chantrey Bequest?
2. Explain in as few words as possi-
ble the necessity which seems to exist
for every member of the New English
Art Club, however young and intelli-
gent, to paint Mr. GEORGE MooRE.
MUSICAL CRITIC PAPER.
Music plays so large a part in our life
that the exclusion of incompetent critics
is a paramount necessity. By way of
achieving that end Mr. Punch suggests
the following test questions:—
1. Explain who were
(a) The Bonn Master.
º The Bayreuth Colossus.
c) The unfortunate Brabantian
nobleman.
2. Distinguish between JoHANN and
RICHARD STRAUSs, BRAHMs and BRAHAM,
CÉSAR FRANCK and César CUI, and state
the nationalities of GRIEG, ONDRICEK,
SILOTI, CAMPOBELL0, BROCoolini, TERNINA
and GIULIO PERKINs.
3. Did GLUCK write Orphée auz
Enfers, and why do English printers
almost invariably prefer the form Glück?
4. Account for the strange fact that
the same pianist has supplied more than
one firm of pianoforte manufacturers
with testimonials stating that their
instruments were superior to all others.
5. Who observed of an inferior per-
former that he played the easiest pas-
sages with the greatest difficulty?
A Questionable Habit.
IN predicting the vogue of the ride-
astride skirt the Ladies' Tailor reminds
us that these garments are occasionally
seen in New York and other American
towns, while in Mexico, the Plate River
and the Malay Archipelago ladies all
ride in this style.
It may perhaps stimulate enthusiasm
for this new fashion if we further inform
our fair readers that quite the best set in
the Camaroons, and the smartest women
in the most exclusive circles of Albert
Edward Nyanza, not to mention tout ce
qu'il y a de plus chic among the
Choctaws, patronise this mode of equi-
tation.
Finis Coronat Opus.
“I HAD been completely run down
through overwork and decided to try
, with the result that in a day or
two I was relieved of a peculiar nervous
dread, and I attribute my present ability
to work long hours .P sustain pro-
longed mental effort to the fact that I
have not yet finished . . . the first half-
crown bottle.—Advt. in the “British

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
JEFFERson Hogg's Shelley at Oxford (METHUEN) is not new.
It first saw light in the %. Monthly Magazine of seventy
years ago. It was, later, incorporated in Hogg's
Life of Shelley, forming the most attractive
feature in the book. TRELAwNY testifies that
“it paints SHELLEY exactly as I knew him.”
To lovers of the poet it is a precious bequest,
bringing close to them the personality of the
- genius in his budding time. Before he took to
writing deathless verse, SHELLEY dabbled in chemistry, to the
alarm of his college scout, the detriment of tablecloths, carpet,
and articles of furniture in his newly-furnished rooms at
Oxford. More than fifty years ahead of electric telegraphy,
nearly a century before telephones and motor-cars, SHELLEY,
combining the gift of the seer with the grace of the poet, fore-
saw the future of electricity. “What a mighty instrument
it would be,” he wrote, “in the hands of him who knew how
to wield it, in what manner to direct its omnipotent energies."
Bats at Twilight, by HELEN M. Boulton (HEINEMANN), is
a story of such absorbing interest as to hold the reader in
its grip in spite of its being somewhat slowly worked ºut,
º º scenes of domestic tragedy, to the end, when
the deaf heroine, a touchingly simple character, sees “the
joyful home-coming within reach.” The author's style is
nervous and incisive, and the characters are drawn in a
masterly manner. The title may be somewhat misleading to
those who, in their light-heartedness, expect to find in Bats at
Twilight a sequel to Cricket on the Hearth, and still more sº
to those of a sporting turn who purchase this book in joyful
anticipation of its being the first of a series whereof the
sequels will be Stumps in the Gloaming, Bowlers at Midnight,
and so forth.
In Greater America (HARPER BROs.) Mr. Colquhoun has
contributed to literature what my Baronite ventures to
predict will be a standard work. Its more than four hundred
pages teem with intimate knowledge of an ordinarily per-
plexing subject. Most of us know America, chiefly on the
route between New York and Chicago. With extensive view
Mr. Colquhoun surveys the relations of the
Republic, present and prospective, with other
parts of the world. T. onroe Doctrine, as
we know, works only in one direction. No
foreign Power may be permitted to estab-
lish itself newly on the mighty continent domi-
7" nated by the ğ. States. But the United
States may (and occasionally does) go afield, picking up
the Philippines, protecting Cuba, and putting a spoke in
Russia's wheel in Manchuria. Mr. Colquhoun, who has
studied the question on the spot, gives an interesting account
of America's work in Cuba and the Philippines. With
respect to her latest expansion by way of the Panama
Canal he has some weighty remarks. Approving it in the
interests of the United States he perceives in it immense stra-
tegic value to Great Britain. It provides an alternative
route to British dominions beyond the seas, at present chiefly
maintained by the Mediterranean and Suez 8. open to
attack all the way from the English Channel to the Red Sea.
Dealing with colossal interests of intricate and multiform
nature, the book is a model of lucid condensation, conveying
fresh and valuable information on a prominent topic of the day.
A Magdalen's Husband, byVINCENT BROWN(DUCKworTH& Co.),
is a dramatically conceived story of a somewhat unsavoury
Zolaesque_type; unequally, but, on the whole, powerfully
written. Not infrequently the author develops a high falutin
style quite out of keeping with the tone of the narrative. To
obtain from the public, as jury, a verdict of “serve him
right" on the fate of the man whom the author is scheming
to sacrifice as victim to the obstinate mad vindictiveness of
his “hero,” is clearly a duty of the novelist's art; but to
overdo the besmirching is dangerous; and, brute beast as is
the murdered man, nought but the proof of temporary in-
sanity can excite in us any sympathy whatever with a hot-
headed assassin who j is sleeping, unresisting
victim. Artistically fine, its chief merit consists in its consci-
entious development of character. Strange that in what may
be considered as part of the lighter relief to the tragic gloom
of the drama we are suddenly reminded of a situation which has
served several French comic dra-
matists as a leading incident in
more than one of their outrageous
farces; for the story of Martin's
father, the seafaring Captain
with two wives, is by no means
a novelty to the Palais Royal
school. Be this as it may, there
can be no doubt as to the genius
of the author of A Magdalen's
Husband, nor as to the firm grip
with which this grim, uncom-
promising story holds the
reader.
BARON
M. BOUDIN IN ENGLAND.
No. IV.
“I HAVE seen your Westminster Abbey and I have seen
your St. Paul's and your Thames Embankment, which is
magnificent, but triste to split your heart, and I have seen
the Bank of England and the Tower of London with the
Beefeaters. Aha, I pinch you, there. What do you think
the Beefeaters is derive from ?”
It was Boudin who spoke, and his manner was aggressive.
“The Beefeaters,” said I, “are derived from—well, isn't
it fairly obvious what they're derived from? There's nothing
very mysterious about a word like that.”
. “Pinched, my old man, pinched,” cried Boudin in great
joy. “Now, I tell you, you think it is British at the back-
bone, that word; it is because that old gentleman, the
invalide in the funny cap and the red tunic and the big
knickerbockers, because %. have always eaten rosbif or
bifteck & l'Anglaise, because he is therefore an old bouledogue
of the first order, that he is called Beefeater. Not a bit. It
is I, JEAN JACQUES MARIE AUGUSTE Boudin, who tell you so.”
“Come, come,” I said, “moderate your transports. What
is it derived from, then?”
“It is from a French word, my brave one, from a French
word, and that word is buffetier. And so you see, old cock
of the walk, when you want to have anything really British
you have to get it from France. And it was from France
you get your Norman kings with their noses like beaks of
eagles. Ah, they have jollily arranged you, did they not?”
—and * he skipped about the room and sang a
verse of the “Marseillaise” at the top of his voice.
He had ; me in a tight place; for I did not know at the
time that his patent derivation for Beefeater was all moon-
shine, and that the word is as much Anglo-Saxon as anyone
can want a word to be. I was forced to let that pass, but I
was not going to let him off quite scot-free.
“My dear BoudN,” I said, “seeing that you live in a glass-
house—”
“Like a peach—oh, yes, I am like a peach,” said he.
“Seeing,” I went on, without noticing his interruption,
“that you live in a glass-house, it is not for you to throw
stones.”

“Doesn't your own nation use plenty of Édish words?
How about the higlif and the struglifeur and le five o'clock

“Aha,” said he, “you think I am caught & l'improviste?
Not a bit. Your silly three words, ‘struggle for life,' we take

—he blew me a kiss with the tips of his fingers—“and that

“And how about “jockey'?”
“And how about ‘châssis’ and ‘chauffeur’? There, you

“Boudin,” I shouted to him, “I warn you, if you go on
I must retaliate. I shall sing “Rule Britannia’—at least, as

should have been singing still, if my wife hadn't come in
and disturbed us.
IN its review of Sir WILLIAM LEE-WARNER's Life of Lord
Dalhousie the Standard remarks:–“He was charged with

his predecessor, yielded the harvest of mutiny and rebellion.
It is one of the main objects of the book to show how little
truth there was in this accusation.” But surely this is good
labour thrown away. The man who would believe that
DALHousie really left this terrible heritage to his predecessor
would believe anything.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LAW AND DISORDER.
Disorder on a “first night” seems to
have reached its climax last Thursday at
Wyndham's Theatre, after the curtain
had fallen on The Bride and Bridegroom,
whose honeymoon thus commenced most
unfortunately. According to report Mr.
ARTHUR LAw's happy pair would have
gone off merrily enough, with the old
slipper thrown after them for luck, but
for the malevolence of the gods (in the
gallery), envious of so much human
happiness. So with one accord they
indulged in the sport of . “manager-
baiting,” which, in the theatrical world,
seems to be on a par with “brawling
in church’’ in the ecclesiastical. Such
disturbers of the piece as these “first-
nighters” ought to be summarily dealt
with at a police-court. Of course rowdi-
ness of this kind can never be lawful,
and in this particular instance both Law
(the author) and Order (which includes
courteously-given free admissions to the
friends of Law) were undoubtedly on
the side of Sir CHARLEs WYNDHAM. In
spite of this stormy commencement, it
is to be hoped that Bride and Bridegroom
will enjoy a happy lume de miel, and that
the “sweet little cherubs” who behaved
in so unangelic a fashion “up aloft”
will in future show themselves to be the
very best of good (gallery) boys, not in
opposition to a known Law, and heartily
ready to give a hand to “CHARLEs his
friend.”
A SUGGESTION.
(For Sir A. Ackland Hood's consideration.).
[Conservative Members, according to Mr.
William REDMond, are accused of lethargy, of
party disloyalty, of a sullen resentment against
the legislative º: of their leaders,
whereas in reality they are merely dissatisfied
with the smoking accommodation.]
O GENTLE Whips, forbear to rave!
i We do not really mean
Disloyalty: we simply crave
My id: N.
Yet always, if we want a whiff,
The smoke-room 's overflowing;
No vacant chair is ever there,
Nor can mere words describe the air,
So off to clubland we repair
To set our Cubas glowing.
The House itself has many a seat

THE DECLINE OF CHIVALRY.
Not of the times portrayed by Monsieur MALORY,
When, poising high in air his barber's pole,
Your lusty knight beneath the ladies' gallery
Took a preliminary caracole, -
Then went and got himself severely bruised
So as to keep the pretty dears amused :-
Not of the period dimly pre-Quixotic
When, wearing mail for flannel next the chest,
Heroes half gladiatorial, half erotic,
Rode out upon the thing º called a Quest:-
Not of those days I speak, for I have read
How that CERVANTEs, cynic, killed them dead.
I speak of other times and other morals,
An age of Tin replacing that of Steel,
When Chivalry à. to hunt for laurels
By charging ponderously, spur at heel,
On deeds of high emprise down Piccadilly
(Unless it wants to look supremely silly).
Doubtless the better sort would gladly nourish
Those notions which occur in ARTHUR's tale;
Doubtless Romance might still contrive to flourish,
Changing its knightly for its Daily Mail,
If Woman would but give our modern gallants
A livelier chance to ventilate their talents.
Men ride abroad in rubbered automobiles,
Naked of armour, bar the nauseous smell,
Not bound on any ransom save to owe bills
Contracted by some errant damosel,
So that in Carlton's Halls, superbly gowned,
She may adorn their Dinner-table Round:
But here their service ends. They fain would wrestle
With horrid dragons or a heathen crew;
Ride ventre-à-terre to help the weaker vessel,
Behaving just as LANCELot used to do;
Only you cannot keep it up much longer
When once the weaker sex becomes the stronger.
With nothing left to learn (outside the nursery),
These types of self-contained and virile strength,
Have they, #. you—kindly take a cursory
Glance at their pictured shapes, three-quarters length,
Exposed, for sixpence, in the social Press—
Have they the air of ladies in distress?
Believe me, Woman's skin is not so tender;
She knows, as well as you, her way about;
Why offer, then, your arm as her defender
hen she can manage nicely, thanks, without?
Why sacrifice your seat in trains or pews,
When she can chuck you from it if she choose?
And, since the creatures we were taught to cherish
Cease to comply with Nature's holy plan,
If the old Chivalry should shortly perish
Let none that finds it murdered blame the man;
But write this epitaph for its demise:
Crushed by a woman's boot (men's extra size).

| “My dear BoudN,” I said to him one morning, “how
comes it that your compatriots, admirable as, no doubt, they
are in many respects, pay so little attention either to the
requirements of religious observance or to the dictates of that
morality which is established as a standard in our own
country?”
I was a little annoyed with Boudin. He had lately been
becoming rather aggressively French. For instance, he was
wearing a low collar and a tie tied in a bow with two large
streamers, a sort of speckled sash, in fact, round his neck.
Besides, he had not expressed what I considered to be a
sufficient admiration for some of the sights I had shown him
and some of the institutions I had explained to him, and on
the whole I thought the time had come when I ought to take
him down a peg.
He looked up at me quickly:-
“What do you drive at?” he said.
my old fellow.”
“Oh come, Boudin,” said I, “you know well enough what
I mean.”
Word of honour, I do not understand a word of what you
said.”
“Well, then,” I began very patiently, for I was determined
to keep my temper, “I’ll try to make my meaning clear to
you. You know we all admire and like the French—”
“Bah!” said Boudin.
“And we realise that they have many great qualities
which—”
“–which you think you have better and greater your-
selves. Oh, I know you, you English.”
44 which,” I continued quietly, “are necessary to the
progress of our common civilisation. At the same time we
are made painfully aware that our lively neighbour, the Gaul,
does not see eye to eye with us on certain matters which go to
the root of life. He is of a volatile and mercurial tempera-
ment, and is apt in mere carelessness to set at naught those
sanctions of morality and orderly conduct which prevail
amongst ourselves. Of the inner life of religion which
shines so brightly amongst people of the Anglo-Saxon race
he has but little conception, while—”
“Oh, thunder!” shouted Boudin, springing from his seat,
“I can no more. My friend, you should write down what
you have said, write it down very careful and correct, and
send it to the Daily Telegraph. They will print it—at least,
provided they have not print it already, for I have read it, I
am sure, somewhere.”
“Be calm, Boudin, be calm. I am not blaming you for it,
I am only stating facts which really cannot be denied. Every-
body knows that the worship of the goddess Aselgeia is still
very prevalent in France.”
F}. been reading MATTHEw ARNOLD, and I thought the
quotation would bowl Boudin over.
“Oh, go away with your goddess,” he said; “I do not
know her. I have not i. honour of being presented to her.
She is not in France. And I tell you, my friend, franche-
ment vous m'éreintez with your everybody. Who is this
everybody? I am one of him, and I deny him. I throw
him into your teeth. What do you, for example, vous qui
m'assommez with your disquisitions, what do you know about
morality in France?”
“My dear Boudin,” I interrupted, “I have spent some time
in Paris.”
| “Oh, I know, read a novel, or you go to the Palais Royal and
you puff with laughter at the play, and you come out and you
so melancholy, and you say,
But what do you know of the life
of my countrymen? Nothing. You do not know—you would

OUR MR. JABBERJEE IN THE FAR EAST.
IV.
In Hon'ble Col. K.'s Headquarters—
but nearer Yalu.
I REGRET to report that my aforesaid piebald pony still
exhibits extreme peevishness. For no sooner do I approxi-
mate him than, like King Claudius, “his heels fly up, his
head remains below !”
Consequently I am curing his doleful dumps by Hon’ble
CHAMBERLAIN's homocea of putting a self-protective tariff upon
his food imports,
And, seeing that up to date he is of more ornament than
utility, I have rather facetiously christened him “The Sho-ji”
—an Anglo-Japanese jeudesprit by which Hon'ble KHAK-
Moxo, on my explaining it, was so immoderately tickled to
death that he requested leave to incorporate it into his
despatches as his own manufacture.
}. I willingly assented—on condition, of course, that
Punch's copyrights in same were strictly reserved.
Interpreting your kind silence as the tacit consent, I have
now furnished myself throughout with a patent wireless
telegraphing pole, fitted complete in best quality finish, as
per illustrated catalogue.
It is far handsomer than any of my competitors', and
already a going concern; so, as soon as I have completed
a highly intricate private code of my own invention, it will,
I fondly hope, entirely supersede all more hum-drum methods
of communication.
My most favourable hour for dropping ačrograms will be
about 5 P.M., and, as you may be aware, in Korea we are
about nine hours faster than Greenwich time. Therefore you
should be upon the tiles of Punch's office punctually between
8 and 9 A.M., when, by lending your ear with even ordinary
attention, I think I may promise that you will not improbably
hear something to your advantage.
Unfortunately, my aforesaid code is still in its embryo, as it
is the matter of difficulty for me always to clearly compre-
hend my own signallings. But you can take it for granted
that a cackling sound, like the thanksgiving hymn of a hen
after safe delivery of a fowl-egg, will mean, either that “All
is quiet on the Yalu,” or that “Some important military
movements may shortly be anticipated.”
As these are the only two messages permitted to special war-
reporters at present, I shall probably be under the necessity
to cackle till further notice.
Col. KHAKIMONo, in very quiet gentlemanly circumlocutions,
has intimated that he may be miserably compelled to set u
any indiscreet correspondents as hon’ble cockshots for su
of his recruits as have not yet fired their class in musketry
practice.
So, being at the loose end of my tether and reduced to kill
Time by the fetlock, I have recently, at the invite of some
Korean native gentlemen, taken part in the battue of a tiger.
There is a Chinese saying that the Korean spends one half
of the year in hunting the tiger, and the remaining half on
the vice versá system; so I was careful, before accepting, to
ascertain that the latter half-season had not yet set in. My
fellow-reporters, who, on my suggestion, were also invited to
share the sport, excused themselves on the somewhat pusillani-
mous plea that tiger-chasing was considered, by all real
Korean sporting-mobs, as a vulgar infra-dig. pursuit.
After a sleepless might, owing to excitement, I turned out
of my cold snug couch at 4 A.M., since it is only the early
bird that catches the worm in bud, and, assuming the kit of
a Nimrod, sallied forth with my shooting-irons, to surprise
“Mister Stripes,” by putting him in the bag.
My manly courage was greatly accelerated by overhearing
the contempt expressed by my fellow ..f. for their
quarry, whom they accused of abject physical cowardice.
Being unaware that this was a mere façon de parler to
sustain their pecker, I pressed myself ahead with ardent
intrepidity until I had the unspeakable satisfaction to run
up against the object of my pursuit while hot-busy with
feeding-time in a mountain gorge!
Now, whether my native friends or the tiger were in error
as to which of us was entitled, under game laws, to close time,
I am not to say. I can only affirm that I became a sauve
qui peut on the spur of the next moment, with the devil
endeavouring to harass my unprotected rear and take my
hindmost !
But providentially I preserved my head sufficiently to lead
my pursuer on to the society of my less adventurous com-
nions, and was running like game to my finish, displaying
º I was afterwards assured by credible eye-witnesses) pheno-
menal proficiency as a sprinter—when suddenly I became lost
to sight and dear to memory in a profound pit hole which had
been insidiously masked in foliage to entrap my formidable
antagonist'
As luck would have it, he failed to notice my compulsory
retirement, and continued his wild career until he was bowled
out by a well-delivered ball from some fellow-tigerslayer.
So, besides severe perforations owing to my descent on
º acutely pointed stakes, I had the additional mortifica-
tion of being unable to be present at the death!
However, for consolation prize, and as a proxime accessit, I
was very kindly awarded a couple of claws and one whisker.
I hope I shall not be exceeding the bounds of amenity and
reverie by forwarding these simple trophies of my chase by
Korean Parcels Post to the gracious ...} cheerful members of
your home circle.
The above-named whisker would, I think, form a rather
splendid egret's feather in the cap (or bonnet) of your
amiable spouse, while the claws, with gold-stoppings, will
make handsome brooches on the shaw
dearest darlings.
Qr rather, as second-hand thoughts are invariably best, I
will reserve my gifts until I can accompany them with a fine
bearskin of own slaying, since I am informed that the bear-
baiting in these parts is even superior to any tiger-stalk.
I am now to narrate a still more shuddering episode:-
A few evenings ago I sauntered out of the camp, in the
Korean get-up of a cloak and tall Welsh horsehair chimney-
pot tile, for private practice on my wireless telegraphic pole.
While endeavouring to send cacklings in direction of
Punch's Office, and being totally unaware that any enemy
was inside my radius, O Geminiſ I was unexpectedly accosted
by a large hirsute Cossack sotnia, who .# in very
rough phraseology the nature of my game!
Being all of a twitter with the apprehension that I might
be mistaken for the Hon'ble Times reporter and shot out of
his hand, I replied that I was simply an orthodox Korean,
engaged in performing my usual evening devotions with the
aid of a portable praying-pole.
But he intimated that this explanation belonged, in his
opinion, to the rat department, and desired me to at once
accompany him to a contiguous Russian officer, or Samovar.
So, perceiving that said sotnia was already in possession of
my scruff of neck, I thought it best to accept his invitation
in the spirit with which it was given.
Thinking that my praying-pole excuse was, perhaps, too
filamentous for the credulity of any superior officer, I trumped
up the more ingenious explanation that I was a native Korean
entomologist, and that it was a native apparatus for capturin
nocturnal lepidopteras, which are notoriously very fine an
large in these localities. Most luckily the Samovar turned
out to be too juvenile and beetle-headed to comprehend the
precise cui bono of my said pole, and proceeded to put some
searching questions to me respecting Japanese tactics and
strategies.

STRANGE denizen of those unbottomed deeps
Whence, having vanished for I know not how long,
You come to ease our minds, and give the creeps
To some astonished mariners at Aolong,
Welcome, thrice welcome!, "Tis a weary time
Since last you came, and saw, and sank rejected,
Dourly to welter in obscurest slime,
Where man was not, and you would be respected.
Year after year, with constant ill-success,
You were benevolently spurred to soften
Th’ autumnal rigours of the Daily Press,
And were denied—and º at—just as often 1
Skippers would log you, giving times and dates;
oc'sle and quarter-deck combine in witness;
While picturesquely gifted bo'sun's mates
Described your ... with more than naval fitness;
But the Great Lubber—bitter shame be his 1–
Blind to the claims of evidence and reason,
Spoke seoffingly of Giant Gooseberries,
And kindred figments of the Silly Season.
So you retired to Ocean's oozy floor
o soothe your hundred feet of outraged vanity,
Nor rose, awhile, to shed the light of your—
May I say—countenance upon humanity.
But now, how sweetly rings the old, old tale!
Men saw a mystic object—diverse fancies
Leaned to a rock, a turtle, or a whale—
When lo! before their horror-stricken glances
Coil upon coil unwound; a frightful crest
Craned upwards; and behold, in girth tremendous,
In length full thirty metres, moved confest
KRAKEN, the Serpent, monstr-ingens-horrendous !
O KRAKEN, those were men of proven skill
In war's alarms, with minds attuned to slaughter,
Armed with horrific engines, which, at will,
Had blown you skywards from your native water.
Nobly they spared you, tho' I know not why;
One would have thought that any sporting cap'en
Would go full steam ahead and have a shy,
Just for the sake of seeing what would happen.
But no such fracas marred the peaceful scene.
You dived beneath the keel, and passed to labb'ord,
And they forbore to seek the magazine,
Nor loosed the hungry cutlass from the scabbard.
One cannot wholly blame them for the fact;
No doubt, if one were placed in their position,
One would have done the same; they may have lacked
Leave to expend their service ammunition;
Maybe their spirit thirsted for the shot
Which more prudential counsel deprecated,
Fearing that, if they missed a vital spot,
You might have actively retaliated.
And though we feel’a soupçon of regret
The chronicle remains; the world has read it;
And you, great KRAKEN, though uncaptured yet,
Are partially, at least, restored to credit.
Not wholly; but one never knows one's luck;
And we may hope, with confident reliance,
That you will soon be comfortably stuck
Or “potted,” in the sacred cause of Science.

THE PERILS OF AUTOGRAPH-HUNTING.
[The letter-box of a contemporary having overflowed, Mr. Punch, with
characteristic chivalry, has come to the rescue of the crowded out.]
DEAR SIR,--I am surprised to see that the five-shilling fee
(destined for a hospital) charged by Mr. CHAMBERLAIN for his
signature is considered high. As an old and keen autograph-
hunter, I can assure your readers that five shillings is a }.
figure. Mr. JESSE Collings asks fifteen, one crown for each
acre. Yours, &c. A KEEN Collector.
DEAR SIR,--I have now no objection to say that I have
recently obtained thirty of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's autographs at
five shillings each, the application being made under a
different alias each time. I sold them in the ordinary way
of business for a sovereign apiece. What I want to know
is, Is this Protection or Free Trade? Yours, &c.
Z. BRAUNEBERGER.
DEAR SIR,-My experiences in connection with an attempt
to obtain Mr. BALFour's autograph should be interesting to
any student of the manners unhappily obtaining in English
public life. First of all I called at Downing Street in person,
requesting to see Mr. BALFour. I had my autograph book
with me, and intended to save him all trouble. I even had
a fountain pen laid on. But I was denied admittance to his
sanctum on the ridiculous plea that a Cabinet Meeting was
in progress! I then wrote explaining that I had been
treated with some discourtesy, and demanding a signed
reply. I received instead a formal letter signed by a
secretary, whose autograph, I have ascertained, is not worth
the paper it is written upon. I wrote again saying so, and
again renewing my application for the PREMIER's signature.
Will it be believed that to this letter I have had no reply?
And Mr. BALFour is sometimes called a gentleman. Absit
onnen. I am, &c., AUTOLYCUs.
DEAR SIR,--It may be of interest in connection with the
correspondence on the cost of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's autograph
if I give the price of a few well-known hands on my list:—

DESPERATE DOINES AT 0XFORD.
(With acknowledgments to the “Daily Mail.”)
SoME sensational letters having reached
this office with regard to the reign of
terror prevailing at Oxford, a represen-
tative of Mr. Punch travelled down to
that classic city last week to collect and
collate information as to the Assassina-
tion Clubs which are alleged to be the
root of the evil.
“Yes,” observed a brawny giant
weighing some nineteen stone, as he
lounged in a rocking chair in his taste-

“And was no redress obtained by the
deceased Peer's sorrowing relatives?”
queried our representative.
“None whatever,” replied the giant
in mournful tones. “You see, owing to
the peculiar jurisdiction of the Vice-
Chancellor—who, by the way, is sup-
posed to be blackmailed by these secret
societies—ordinary legal procedure is
not available.”

covered, would not be prosecuted?”

opinion is entirely on their side. Per-

especially the practice of torturing the
victims——”
“Do you mean to say they torture
them first?”
“Yes, by dislocating their limbs.
Allow me to show vou,” and, suiting
the action to the word, the giant seized
his interlocutor by the ankle and gave
his leg so violent a pull that he incon-
tinently swooned. On coming to he was
conscious of a parching thirst, and feebly
asked for water.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 2.-
So the MARKISS is to have his monument.
Settled to-night in one of those casual
conversations that sometimes conveni-
ently take place between private Member
and Minister. St. MICHAEL-what a fine
statue he'd make with All Angels
artistically disposed about a pedestal!—
asked whether PREMIER Prº to move
a vote to cover expenses. PRINCE ARTHUR
modestly replied it was not a matter on
which he could be expected to take
initiative. But, since St. MICHAEL men-
tioned it, certainly thought course sug-
gested was desirable.
Members on both sides cheered. All
Englishmen are proud of the MARKISS,
admiring not least his unconcealed con-
tempt for the majority of them. In an
age of self-advertisement he was scorn-
fully silent. He never bent his knee to
that political Baal the Man in the Street.
Rather he delighted to flout him with
utterance of what came to be known as
blazing indiscretions. Only drawback
to satisfaction in prospect of a statue of
the Victorian statesman lies in appre-
hension of what may be turned out.
We are a great people, mighty in com-
merce. We can colonise. But we can
neither carve nor cast statues. Think of
our Dukes of York, our Nelsons, our
Prince Consorts.
SARK says the only decent modern
statue he ever happed upon in London
stood for awhile in the square at the

An Exception to THE RULE
Mr. W-nst-n Ch-rch-ll said that “The late
Colonial Secretary had greatly reduced the
amount of flogging all over the British Empire.
(Cheers.) It was a question on which the rt. hon.
gentleman held very strong views.” . (We
strongly suspect that his dislike of flogging is
not of universal application')

to him by his own experiences at Nikko.)
bottom of the Haymarket, by the Athe-
naeum Club. It showed OUTRAM, with
sword drawn, riding to battle—a live
man, a living horse. Passed by a week
later to feast his eyes on the rare spec-
tacle, and lo, it was gone. Too good for
London, it had been captured by Calcutta.
Since then there has been placed in
the quadrangle of Burlington House
WATTs’ equestrian statue, a real thing
handicapped by a ridiculous label.
“Physical Energy” it is called, just
as vou would write “Black Currant” or
“Gooseberry” on the parchment covers
of pots of jam. Besides, WATTs is not
likely to undertake the MARKiss. So
Common-place will, in the end, take its
revenge over the mighty mind, the keen
intellect, that in public and private
scathed it through more than fifty years.
Yet the leonine head, the massive
figure of the MARKiss, lent themselves
generously to the sculptor's art. There
are men still living who remember Lord
ROBERT CECIL the counterfeit resemblance
of Cousin HUGH, who after the lapse of
half a century sits in his father's old
quarters below the gangway. Tall, slim,
with stooping shoulders, head bent for-
ward to discharge the barbed darts
fashioned by an acrid tongue, Dizzy's
old foeman of the 60's gave no promise
of the figure which loomed in the sight
of man in the opening days of the twen-
tieth century. We are more familiar
with the great bulk, the colossal weight,
the slow tramp down the corridor, across
the central lobby, reminiscent of an
elephant treading a thicket, solitary,
meditative, unnoticing.
If the chosen sculptor knew the
MARKISS in the flesh, had the genius to
conceive an embodiment of his presence
in bronze, and the skill to realise it, we
should be blessed indeed. But Ifear me.

No; M'KENNA made no insinuation,

DON José insisted.
No, M'KENNA didn't bite his thumb
at him; did not, in appreciable degree,

merely as a note of interrogation.

to get in a word. Amid yelling cheers

Division lobbies in succession of divi-

Business done.—Budget Resolutions
carried through report stage.
Friday .*&#. the gallant Jap
stands at grip with the Russ by the
banks of the far-off Yalu River, Mr.
| WEIR, seated in the House of Commons,
|recalls an episode in his visit to Japan.
|When he entered one of the sacred
|temples at Nikko, or crossed the threshold
of Palace of the ancient Mikados at Tokio,
there approached him two fair damsels
who lisped, “Boots.”
. At first, the Member for Ross and
Cromarty, shrewd Highlander though he
be, was baffled. The interval afforded
opportunity of gazing upon the damsels
who, prone on hands and knees, looked
up at him with laughing gaze. Behold,
they were fair.
“Boots,” they murmured, drawing in
their breath with that gurgling sound
peculiar to a Japanese when he or she
desires to please.
Then it dawned on Mr. WEIR that on
the sanctity of the temple floor, on the
snow-white purity of the Palace plank-
ing, no earth-crusted boot must press.
In brief, he was expected to have his
boots removed and slippers substituted
before he entered.
Cloud of disappointment gathered
over the brow of SARK as WEIR recited
the incident to the House. He whispers
to me how, when he and I were in
Japan, we partly shared Mr. WEIR's
experience. We, also, were required to
remove our boots. Service was per-
formed, not by dimpled damsels with
almond eyes and snow-white teeth, but
by our guide or other male attendant.
Birds of a feather flock together. Mr.
WEIR drew the youth and beauty of
Japan, as he fails to “draw" the Lord
Advocate on the topic of trawlers in
lonely inlets of northern seas.
Incident happened in debate on vote
for Houses of Parliament. System of
ventilation discussed, as it has been
annually talked of since the days when

Mr. WEIR explains it all. The radical
fault that shatters an intricate costly

observation, Mr. WEIR, by use of pecu-

the lower notes of his impressive voice

tions, takes refuge in silence as

sough of wind in the caves of wintry
Staffa, a sepulchral groan, “No answer.”
It rises from the level of Mr. WEIR's
boots. Enlarging on his argument, Mr.
WEIR shows how fresh air ascending from
the floor comes in contact with boots of
Members and is carried upward to throat
and nostril.
“Why not,” he persuasively adds,
“engage the services of two Japanese
girls, who will remove the boots of
honourable Members before they enter
the House.”
Two? What are they among so
many? The matter is a larger one
than Mr. WEIR sketches. It would not
be necessary for every Jack to have his
Jill. But two Japanese damsels to
remove the boots of 670 Members, some
of them Irish, and only one (a naval
authority) with a wooden leg, is ridi-
culously disproportionate. If Mr. WEIR's
suggestion be accepted, and no doubt it
has been received with a wave of plea-
surable excitement, the damsels must be
brought over in transport ships, like the
Chinese labourers for South Africa.

usiness done.—Private Members'.
THE WIRE-PULLERS.
III.--THE MATERIALISER.
JUST as we passed the Dragon in Fleet
Street the driver of our omnibus suddenly
reined in his horses. The cause of the
disturbance was a large brewer's dray
which had come down Chancery Lane
and was trying to take its place in the
stream of traffic going west.
“Nah ven, Bung-'ole,” said the bus-
driver, “fink yer goin' to stuff up the
bloomin' road 2 ”
The speech struck me as terse and
pointed, and I was accordingly not a
little surprised at what followed. An
old gentleman who was sitting on one
of the front seats leaned forward and
tapped the driver on the shoulder.
“No, no,” he said, “that's not at all
the thing. You must consider your
metaphors. A bung-hole cannot stuff
up a road. Had you said “bung’ instead
of “bung-hole' it might have passed.
But there is a chance for something far
more brilliant. You could have said, of
course in your own inimitable way,
something }. ‘Now then, Barrels.
What are you doing out of your cellar?
The Tuppenny Tub is the place for you.
Your |. would just about fit it.'
Something like that.”
“Right O, Guv'nor,” said the man;
“better luck next time.”
During this little, conversation I had
whipped out an envelope and jotted
down a note for my great novel. I felt
that I had found a type which would
ensure its welcome as one of the master-
pieces of the cent My excitement
attracted the old gentleman's attention.
“You are a genius, are you not?” he
asked.
“Yes,” I said.
“Unrecognised ?”
“Practically.”
“Not entirely?”
“Well,” I said, “I have an aunt—”
“Yes, yes,” he interrupted, “I knew
that. But you would like the world to
recognise you? Well, I'm your man.
Nowadays, the genius in literature or
art is the person who can depict life as
it really is. Very few can, so I go about
teaching life to behave as it is depicted.
That produces the same result in the
long run. If I come across a genius
who cannot hold the mirror up to nature,
I hold nature up to the mirror. It's my
hobby.
“Take, for example, this omnibus-
driver. Nature prompts him to speak
as you heard him speak. Mr. PETT
RIDGE, one of my protégés, would have
him speak more according to the instruc-
tions you heard me give. The ultimate
result of that must be the recognition of
Mr. PETT RIDGE as a very observant
writer.”
“Have you many clients?” I asked.
“Hundreds. But you are wrong to
call them clients. The majority of them
are quite unaware of my existence.
There's Mr. DANA GIBSON, for instance.
I've done a great deal for him in the
way of cultivating his particular type of
feminine beauty.’
“You send out specially trained ladies,
I suppose?”
“No, certainly not. It's done entirely
with dressmakers' lay-figures. Women
will imitate models, but they will not
imitate one another. I hope soon to
have a couple of dozen genuine Gibson
girls distributed over London, and so
establish the artist's reputation for
fidelity to nature. But my work is
always rather delicate where women are
concerned. I much prefer the other sex.
“I spent a most successful season,
recently, stocking Scottish slums with
Wee Macgreegors. I have devoted quite
a lot of my time for some years to
getting detectives to measure footprints,
smoke shag, and act generally like
Sherlock Holmes. You ſº perhaps not
believe me, but there is hardly a man
in the Force to-day who doesn't carry
pocket editions of GABORIAU and EDGAR
ALLEN PoE.
“Art, too. I have peppered the country
with CECIL. ALDIN's popular creations—
parsons who play golf till they are red
in the face with suppressed imprecations;
huntsmen who sit till the last minute in
front of gigantic e-pies; vehicles
with no spokes to their wheels. I have
an estate reserved for the rearing of
trees after the pattern of HERBERT
RAILTON, and in the same artist's interest
I have laid out heaps of money in white-
washing old iron gates to make them
stand out well against dark backgrounds.
If in the near future you happen upon
any rather fat people with their hands
carefully thrust out of sight behind
them, you will know that I have been
giving a little of my attention to Mr.
HASSALL.
“Those are just a few of my favourites.
But I do also a good deal of promiscuous
work that has no application to any
particular genius. I can say without
boasting that there are to-day scores of
Scotsmen about who couldn't see a joke
if you paid them to, and Irishmen who
really do say, ‘och’ and ‘arrah, be
jabers,' and carry a shillelagh.”
“Do you work much out .# England?”
“Not at present, but I hope to extend
my field. In American plantations I
intend to teach the coons that quaint
inquisitiveness which impels them to
spend so much time in gazing with
shaded eyes into space, and I shall also
introduce some dress reforms if I can
get a tailor to supply trousers with one
leg permanently turned up. And I am
thinking of instructing miners in Aus-
tralia and the Klondike in the subtle
pathos of dreaming of home. Now, is
there anything I can do for you?”
“I am afraid,” I said, with hesitation,
“that—that—”
“Ah, I see,” he said. “You would
rather try and get on without me.
Well, well. Most of them feel that way
—at first. Candidly, I admire you for
it. But I’ll bear you in mind all the
same. Hullo!—excuse me a minute.
There's one of Mr. JACOBs' seamen just
come out of Liverpool Street station,
looking as though he were not altogether
at sea in London. I must alter that.”
He flew down from the bus, one step
at a time, and that is the last I have
seen of him.
IN the description of the grand foyer
of the recently extended Savoy Hotel it
is mentioned that there is a sculptured
group representing “The Three Graces.”
Surely, as appropriate to the restauration
department, there ought to have been
just double the number—symbolising the
graces before and after the three princi-
l meals of the day, Breakfast, Lunch,
inner. Supper being an extra, another
couple of graces would be superfluous.
A GENEROUs FoE.-Pending the com-
letion of the Russian commissariat the
apanese have offered to give them
beans, as many as they care to have.

is re-presented to us as an
old operatic friend who
has refused to be cut.
Doctor HANs has pre-

eration is necessary. Thus is it that we get the Don
ost to perfection. An excellent performance to a com-
aratively small, though select, audience. “No Royalties”
F. which announcement sounds to joyful musical pub-
lishers' ears like “No Fees.” Fräulein DESTINN as Donna
Anna is the first novelty, and, instantly, a great success:
Miss ALICE NIELSEN as Zerlina is the second, about whom
there is too much Gaiety-girlishness. Monsieur RENAUD's
Don we know and admire; and as Leporello and Mazetto
Messrs. JoURNET and GILBERT, always amusing, give us
nothing new, and have forgotten nothing old. As the statue,
who, like some weary habitués, nods towards the end of the
opera, Mr. RADFORD is basso-profondly statuesque. With
Dr. RICHTER and his orchestra, including three bands in the
ball-room, no fault can be found.
Tuesday.—Tristan und Isolde. House, never inconveni-
ently crowded, revealed at first the aching void proper to the
pre-prandial hour. Herr BurriaN and Frau REINI, (each a
new and welcome guest at the Garden party) made a pair
of lovers of the robust type associated with Wagnerian
traditions. Yet “mighty and mellow" were mixed in their
singing; and the great duet of the Second Act, exquisitely
sung in its softer movement, gave them * scope for
qualities of sweetness and strength not always found
together. Madame KIRKBY LUNN's most sympathetic render-
ing of the part of Brangäne was a pure delight, notably
in that difficult
passage where her
voice breaks in out
of the night upon
the lovers' amorous
session. The climax

into the forest, and might easily, without information received
from Detective Melot, have aroused the suspicions of
King Mark. Herr KNüPFER, in the rôle of that outraged
monarch, enunciated his homily on the proprieties with a
right portentousness. Subsequently Tristan took a most un-
conscionable time in dying; but that was not the fault of
Herr BURRLAN, who must have wanted his supper. Herr
SCHütz, as Kurwenal, enjoyed himself most on the ship,
where his staccato methods recalled the choppiness of a
Channel passage. Herr REISs, as the herd, played his piping
part admirably through the medium of a gentleman in the
orchestra. Here, and on the head of its conductor, Dr.

Thursday-Two magnificent bouquets occupied the Royal
Box until the arrival of their Majesties at about 8.30. Con-
sidering that the KING and QUEEN had only arrived from
Ireland—after their most successful and thoroughly popular
visit—at 6.30, this, “their first appearance” at the Opera
after their tour de
plaisir must be re-
corded as a genuine
tour de force. An
excellent perform-
ance of Roméo et
Juliette awaited
them; Mlle. SU-
ZANNE ADAMS being
a most sweet sing-
ing and thoroughly
dramatic heroine,
true as a Juliette
should be, without
the single false note
even wherewith to pay the crafty but impressive herbalist
Frère Laurent (M. Journet), as an illegal marriage fee. Once
again we salute our undefeated favourite, Mlle. BAUERMEISTER,
in one of her most popular impersonations, namely, that
of the highly trained nurse, Gertrude; and M. SALEZA,
who, as Roméo, is as fresh as he was in 1902, when, as now,
Signor MANCINELLI was the bótonnier. The entr'actes, on this
occasion, occupying less time than usual, the evening was
most enjoyably passed in the society of Messieurs GUILLAUME
SHAKSPEARE, Gounod, and company. “Et vive la Compagnie!”
Friday.—Tannhäuser. Suppose the Hörselberg must at
one time have had its attractions for the hero, but to-night
Herr BURRIAN frankly turned his back on the ballet and a
couple of rather risky tableaux vivants provided for his enter-
tainment. And indeed they manage these things better at
the Halls. He was not altogether happy in the scene with
Venus (Frau EGL1), who sang more than respectably but just
fell short of fascination. As his case became more desperate,
Herr BURRIAN's singing, as distinct from his action, improved
steadily in dramatic power: and he was at his best in the
vening Star, which had grown brighter
and brighter at the prospect of being sung to by Wolfram,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
The Life of Frederick William Farrar, by . REGINALD
FARRAR (JAMEs NISBET & Co.), is an interesting biography
of a distinguished ecclesiastic who, when Canon of West-
minster, was reckoned among the most popular of preachers.
In his outspoken, manly character he somewhat resembled
CHARLEs KINGSLEY, though he could not be reckoned among
the professors of muscular Christianity. As a parish clergy-
man, FARRAR was energetic and thorough ; a lover of Art;
indefatigable as author and lecturer at home, in Canada, and
in the States. An ultra Liberal, almost Radical in politics,
he owed his first preferment to the great Conservative
minister DISRAELI, ini for his subsequent promotion to the
Deanery of Canterbury he was indebted to Lord RoseBERY.
Had Dean FARRAR been less courageously outspoken he would
have been a Bishop. But his opinions were considered
dangerous by “the safe side,” and the Dean was no Dr.
TRIMMER. The biography lacks an index of reference.
In English history, and in hearts of Englishmen all over
the world, the New Forest lives by reason of two circum-
stances. One, the death of RUFUs; the other, the choice of
residence by Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT, who for
more than a generation has murmured in
the glades round Malwood the impromptus
with which, in ordered speech, he later de-
lighted the House of Commons. Mr. HoRACE
HUTCHINSON has written a book about The
New Forest (METHUEN) which does justice to
the alluring theme. Lightly sketching its
history, he saunters around, pointing out its sylvan beauties
and its points of historic interest. In both fields he has been
helped by Mr. WALTER TYNDALE and Miss LUCY KEMP-WELCH,
who between them contribute fifty-four charming sketches re-
produced in colour. Most are charming enough to suggest
framing. But it would be barbarous to divorce them from
the text. My Baronite has the delight of knowing Beaulieu
Abbey, which has for many years found a loving custodian
in the father of our dear John Scott-MonTAGU, Member for
the New Forest division. Taking into account all the
architectural treasures handed on to the twentieth century,
Time has bestowed no more beautiful guerdon than Beaulieu.
Of it and of other bits of the ancient forest Mr. HUTCHINSON
chats in charming fashion. People who for divers reasons
cannot visit the New Forest may, thanks to this beautiful
volume, take patches of it home with them.
Of all the books of ready reference commend me to
Bartlett's Concordance to Shakspeare, published by Messrs.
MACMILLAN. Good and satisfactory as is the well-known
compilation of CRUDEN this American production of BARTLETT's
is better, and far more satisfactory in its completeness.
Frequently hath the Busy Baron, when improving the shining
hour and gathering honey from every petal of the flowers of
literature, to pause in order to verify some quotation, pro-
fessedly Shakspearian; and to no better authority upon the
subject can he turn than to this work of BARTLETT's, which
was commenced in 1876 and brought out in 1891; its latest
edition is dated 1894.
CLARK RUSSELL and Joseph CoNRAD, A.B.'s both, write books
relevant to the sea, vivid with its colour, whether sleeping in
sunlight or raging in storm. They generally go down to the
sea in ships bound south. In The Way of the Sea (HopDER
AND STOUGHTON) Mr. NorMAN DUNCAN goes north and west to
Newfoundland. Here is a sea of quite another sort, its
dangers dared by men and boys of a race new to the British
novel-reader. It is the first time my Baronite has come
across work by this author. In descriptions of the North
Atlantic surging round the rugged coast of Newfoundland,
it is magnificent. In dealing with the fisher-folk there are
frequent touches of humour and pathos. The chapter
“Concerning Billy Luff” is a gem of purest ray serene.
i. The Poets' Corner, by Max BEERºom, published by
;INEMANN, is an album of coloured caricatures of a daringly
eccentric and utterly bizarre character, which, absurd as they
are, must be as caviare to the general public unacquainted
with the individuality of the more modern originals.
Where SHAKSPEARE, BYRON, or BURNS is caricatured, the utter
absurdity of the picture suffices
for amusement. The entire col-
lection will no doubt be laugh-
ingly and tolerantly appreciated
by many kindred spirits among
artists and literary men “in the
know.” It would have shown ſºftſ.
better taste on the part both of Eºs
author-artist and his publisher ºf
had they decided to omit the silly W.
nursery kind of caricature de-

This is the blot on the scutcheon.

THOUGH tactfully reluctant to employ the word “affection”
About her present feeling for the writer of the rhyme,
Undoubtedly AMANDA shows a certain predilection
Which rather makes him fancy that the rest may come in
time.
I'm bound to add, however, and it nearly drives me frantic—
Whenever I attempt to give my aspiration wings,
And make my conversation sentimental or romantic,
She will insist on talking of the most prosaic things!
I spoke of lyric poetry; my words were not at all meant
o bear upon the topic which she strove to introduce—
The plain advisability of buying (by instalment)
A “‘Helicon’—the typewriter for every poet's use”!
“The fire of my emotion”—as I still submit, with deference—
Is not the sort of phrase which leaves you doubtful what it
At any rate, it need not have elicited a reference [means;
To Somebody's abominable “Putitout” machines!
Already I begin to feel a trifle apprehensive;
To be with her is pleasant, but I really wonder why
She always talks of bargains—which are far from inexpensive,
Which—here's the dreadful part of it!—she wishes me to
buy.
She begs me, and of course I yield; she smiles—it's pleasant,
very;
To gain her smile is worth, I know, a lot of sacrifice;
But why should it assume the form of writing off for sherry—
A rather common sherry, at a most uncommon price?
Perplexed why dear AMANDA should be bent on my undoing,
I come across this paragraph—and do not like its sound!
Well, either I must manage to accelerate my wooing—
Or pay a final dividend of sixpence in the pound !

one and only possessor of that honoured name, whose palatial
residence in Bouverie Street, Fleet Street, is “the hub of the

M. BOUDIN IN ENGLAND.
No. VI.
“My faith,” said Boudin a few mornings ago, as he put
down the Times, which he had been studying for some time
with great absorption, “my faith, but he is a great man,
your Mr. BALFOUR. Word of honour, I take off my hat to
him and I make him a reverence of the most humble. He
have piqued me the heart with his speech.”
I admit I was pleased, for a good many of us here in
England, Ifancy, are rather proud of our BALFOUR and think
him a striking statesman of sagacious and highly disinterested
principles. The difficulty, of course, is to get a foreigner to
agree with us. Most of them seem never to have heard of
him. I met an Austrian last month who was thoroughly up
in Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, but when I put in a word for ARTHUR
BALFOUR he looked quite blank. I was all the more glad,
therefore, to find Boudin so appreciative:—
“Yes, my dear Boudin,” I said, “he really is a great man,
and, besides that, he has a most extraordinary courtesy to
his opponents, a charm of manner which makes people love
im even when they most disagree with him, a kind of
graceful politeness, a je ne sais quoi, which—"
“Ah, that is it,” cried Boudin ecstatically, “I do not speak
of his courtesy so chevaleresque, nor of his graceful polite-
ness. It is the je ne sais quoi which I mean. You have
said it, my brave, and you have said it in French which is,
by blue, #. only language which serves to describe a man so
remarkable.”
“Oh, for the matter of that,” said I, “I could describe
him in English fast enough, only I thought—”
“Yes, you thought, admirable man that you are, that for
me it would be easy if you do it in French. Here, you say
to yourself, is that poor Boudin, that Frenchman so ignorant
and so grossier, he will not understand our Mr. BALFour in
English; for Boudin's sake I use a French phrase—and,
sapristi, you do it, and it is Boudin who is profoundly
touched with what you do for him.”
I didn't want to let him drivel along on that line, so I
harked back:
“But, Boudin,” I asked, “what is it that has struck you so
particularly to-day about Mr. BALFOUR”
“Here i. is,” said Boudin, taking up the Times and
adjusting his pince-nez. “He speak about a Licensing
| which, my faith, I do not understand and I do not mix
myself with it, and someone ask him who is to compensate
the widow and the son and the daughter who have been
ruined by the publicans, and he say, ‘Sir,’ he say, “these
people are ruined by their gross and criminal self-indulgence.
The fault,' he say, ‘lies with the drunkard, with the man
who cannot control his appetites.' And he compare him to
members of Parliament and say the man drink more than
members of Parliament who never drink too much, and he
blame him, word of honour, he blame him for "--he read
this with great deliberation—“‘for the lack of manly self-
control which is º to resist temptation.' I you,
my fine fellow, your Mr. BALFOUR he speak like a père noble
in the theatre. Have you ever hear the père noble speak?”
“Yes, but how—”
“Well, you know, the père noble he has a bald head with
white favourites—that is to say, whiskers—and he has a big
waistcoat beautifully arounded and a thick gold watch-chain,
and he speak the most beautiful things about virtue and
honour and modesty, and he say long tirades very vehement
against wicked men and vice, and oh, but he is a dear little
innocent white lamb this père noble—and that is I think,
your Mr. BALFour when he speak of the laborious clºsses and
the lack of manly self-control, and, enfin, all that heap of
nonsense I read to you from the Times.”

“Oh, it is not your Mr. BALFOUR alone.
We have them in France, too, these
deputies who think the poor man whose
life is hard and whose pleasures are not
many, my old fellow — that he shall
always resist, resist, resist, and if he do
not resist the temptation, well, he shall
sink to the bottom of the sea, and we
shall thank God we have sent there so
poor a type.”
“Well, why not?” I asked.
“And you too; et tu, Brute! Make
him less the temptation, sapristi, and in
the end you make him stronger, the poor
man. But to talk like a pere noble is to
talk like a ombog, and it is not the less
true because it is I, JEAN JACQUES MARIE
AUGUSTE Boudin, who tell you so. Come,

MERE WACUUM.
I was conscious of an unusual some-
thing in the air as I walked up the street
to call on MABEL, something between a
motor-car marking time and the bursting
of a waterpipe. Still meditating as to
the cause of the disturbance I came in
view of the house, and my heart stood
still at the sight before me. Through a
turbulent crowd which overflowed the
road into the front garden I caught a
glimpse of a scarlet engine, and through
a cloud of white smoke I saw the fire-
men's hose-pipes trailing down, like
white serpents, from each doomed
window. The vision of MABEL in flames
roused me to frenzy, and pressing my
top hat firmly on my head I dashed
through the crowd and into the open
front-door. The hall and ground floor
were crowded by strange men pulling
at the heavy furniture, or running the
hose-pipes up the stairs, while in the
back-ground, pale and excited, stood
the pretty parlour-maid. I seized her
shoulder and shook it frantically.
“Are they all out !” I cried.
“Lor' no, Sir!” she said in a startled
voice; “they're all upstairs!”
“Great heavens!” I ejaculated, “what
are they doing?—looking after their
jewellery, I suppose.” And disregard-
ing the angry glances of the men, who
seemed to resent my remark, I leaped up
the stairs to the drawing-room door, and,
flinging it open, stood transfixed by the
sight that met my eyes. MABEL, BERTIE
her small brother, BERTIE's governess and
MABEL's mother were sitting serenely
about the room at afternoon tea.
“Isn't there a fire?” I remarked
feebly.
BERTIE laughed aloud, but MABEL,
with her sweet eyes on mine, replied:
“No, it's only the vacuum cleaner at
work.”

“DON'T POINT 1 ''
Tommy (remembering his mother's lecture on the subject). “Oh, MUMMY DEAR, Isn't
THAT VERY RUDE?”
MABEL's mother said: “Really, Mr.
GREEN, you startled me dreadfully!”
BERTIE's governess said: “Indeed,
yes.” And all the while I was conscious
of the little beast they call Flipsie–
one of those waistcoat-pocket pet dogs,
a cross between a rat and a spider–
making a tour round my boots and
wling diminutive thunder to itself.
I should have married MABEL last
autumn if it hadn't been for Flipsie.
Flipsie ruled the house with absolute
authority, and from the first had declined
to look favourably on me or my suit.
MABEL's mother chose her friends, servants
and tradespeople according to Flipsie's
unerring instinct—and I was weighed
in the balance and found wanting.
“What a marvellous thing instinct
is l’” said MABEL's mother; “his intelli-
gence penetrates where ours fails. All
that is hidden from us is laid bare to
him. Do you remember what an extra-
ordinary aversion he had to the green-
—a fair-spoken young man—who
afterwards forged his master's name
and attempted to murder his aunt?”
At that moment I felt ready for a life

of crime myself, but I merely asked
MABEL in a ſow voice if she would show
me the cleaner at work. She rose with
alacrity, but her mother interposed.
“BERTIE will ibe, delighted to show
you, Mr. GREEN.”
I followed BERTIE. A man was
wandering up and down, directing the
end of a hose-pipe along the carpet, the
large open-mouthed nozzle of which
sucked up all dirt, dust, fluff and
feathers, and in fact all unconsidered
trifles that came in its reach. The man's
attention was somewhat distracted by the
presence of the pretty parlour-maid in
an adjoining room, and presently, after
warning BERTIE not to go too near, he
left the pipe and went to help her hang
a pair of curtains. No sooner was his
back turned than BERTIE swiftly slipped
an open paper under the gaping mouth
of the vacuum pipe. Instantly the paper
was licked up with all its contents.
“What's that?” I said.
“Oh, only my night powders,” he
replied gleefully; “now I'm going to
fetch that lace collar they make me
wear, and my toothbrush. I say, it's a
pity you haven't got yours with you.”
As he ran out of the room an idea
struck me which in the sequel led the
way to MABEL and matrimony. Ever
since I left the drawing-room Flipsie
had been dangling attentions, as usual,
on my boots—my furtive but vicious
kicks only strengthening the bond
between us. The aperture of the pipe
lay upturned on the carpet, sucking in
the air with an uncanny swish. I
approached my patent leather boot with
Flipsie in attendance nearer and nearer,
till only five inches divided us, and then
I gave my foot a frantic wrench back to
counteract the horrid pull that suddenly
dragged it—like a steel filing to a
magnet—into the vortex of this domestic
maelstrom. I wrenched myself free and
looked down with a strangely beating
heart. Flipsie had disappeared 1
Hastening through the door, I upset
BERTIE and a miscellaneous collection
he was carrying, amongst which I
noticed the governess's pince-nez, a
book of five-finger exercises, and a pat
of soap. I dashed downstairs, hailed a
passing hansom, and fled the scene.
Three days later I received the fol-
lowing message from MABEL:-
“We have lost our darling Flipsie; he
must have strayed away when the
cleaners were here. Our grief seems to
have drawn us closer together, and
Mamma wants you to come to dinner
to-night, and bring your music. She says
that personally, she always liked you.
Poor darling Flipsie!—Yours, MABEL.
“P.S.— š. vacuum people have writ-
ten most insultingly to Mamma, saying
the dirt in our house was so abnormal it
has quite choked their pipes.”

writing-pad on the top of the stumps,
but he must not remove the bails in
doing so.
The FIELDSMEN.
XIV. Short leg must know shorthand.
THE RolleR.
XV. The roller is to be used only after
the completion of an innings. Players
should place their writing-pads beneath
it in order that the crease may be taken
out of their style.
THE STRIKER.
XVI. The striker shall be out if in
his report of the match he splits an
infinitive;
XVII. Or if while stepping out to set
down a good adjective he draws his foot
over the popping-crease, and the wicket-
keeper, abandoning his pen for the
moment, stumps him;
XVIII. Or if he writes “and which ; ”
XIX. Or if in running he obstructs
the field by jogging the arm of anyone
who is writing.
WRITER's CRAMP.
XX. The match shall be considered
drawn when more than four players on
either side are incapacitated by writer's
cramp.
THE ANTI-MEAT MOVEMENT.
A GREAT meeting was held at the
Albert Hall on Saturday last to discuss
the subject of national diet, with special
reference to the growing tendency to
abstain from flesh foods, as recommended
by Dr. HAIG.
Lord Avebury, who occupied the chair,
said that bees, who were man's superior
in almost every department except, per-
haps, banking—his own banks he would
remark, in the poet's phrase, were
“furnished with bees” — were strict
believers in the HAIG convention, if he
might be allowed a pleasantry. It was,
he would remind them, after office hours.
No bee was ever known to eat a beef-
steak, yet their polity was beyond praise.
M. CARAMELo, the chef of the Churchill
Restaurant, who spoke under the influ-
ence of strong emotion, declared that
unless this pernicious habit of low
feeding were to be checked, the most
refined of the arts would perish of
inanition. Only the night before, an
aristocratic party from the Opera came
in to supper and ordered a dish of nut
cutlets. On his refusal to prepare these
ignoble viands, they promptly withdrew
to a vegetarian restaurant in the Strand.
Mrs. EARLE said that her only objection
to Dr. HAIG's system was the omission of
goats' milk from the régime. Goats'
milk was an essential to health, although
among the milkers the rate of mortality
was high. This was because they were
not sufficiently padded. Since the death

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR MR. JABBERJEE IN THE FAR EAST.
W.
Grand Hôtel Bellevue,
Port Arthur, Manchuria.
It would not at all surprise me, Eminent Sir (since it
seems you are so faint-hearted a fishmonger as to cry down
your piscine merchandise for too closely resembling a post
mortem whale!) to find that you will once more caution your
readers that they are only to swallow my above address with
a very large saline grain! [ED. CoM.—We must admit that
the idea HAD occurred to us.]
How well did the late King Lear exclaim: “Blow me,
thou winter wind, you do not crack my cheek so unkindly
as the serpentine tooth of a thankless editorial!” I garble
from memory, as these outlandish neighbourhoods do not
possess any Dictionary of Familiar Quotations. -
Doubtless you will wring your withers, like a wincing and
jaded Gaul, under the lash of my sava indignatio—but I am
not a mere Free Trader that I can take a kick in my nether
regions lying down! [ED. CoM.—What on earth have we
done Now?] -
I would respectfully ask: is it first-class cricket to hit me
below my unarmoured belt with the insinuation that I am
ulling your leg-before-wicket? It is vanity to deny that I
É. caught you out as the fragrant derelict-for under
your velvet glove I detect a cloven hoof in all its naked
hideousness! [ED. CoM.—We are at a loss to conceive how
we can have deserved this ferocious metaphor.]
Still, as Hon'ble IsAAC WALTON said to his favourite la
hound, after it had carelessly devoured his inimitable
treatise on The Laws of Gravitation: “Diamond, Diamond,
Evil is wrought by want of Thought, as well as want of
Heart!”
So perhaps you did not anticipate the ting anxiety
with J. » º a stranger in a º, i.i. where there
is only one postal delivery per diem, and none at all on
Sundays, was awaiting the arrival of the copy of Punch
containing the first instalment of my egregious lucubrations!
Otherwise, surely, surely you would not have inserted so
many insidious fleas in my defenceless ear!
It is true that you commenced with the flattering compli-
ment of a notice that my contribution was published “under
considerable reserve,” thereby betraying that at least you
deemed them worthy of protection against the piracies of
rival periodicals.
But, lack-a-daisy! you proceeded to interpolate sundry notes
and comments, which (whether so intended or not) must
infallibly produce the unimpeachable impression that you do
not re myself as an absolute bona fide!
I venture to think, Sir, that such a breach of ordinary
Punic faith entitles me to pose as an injured innocent—even
if I should not demand legal damages for defamation of my
character'
As for the very mediocre honorarium forwarded by same
mail (receipt of which I beg to acknowledge with thanks) I
may . like Hon'ble SAMUEL Jonson in his preface to
Boswell's Dictionary of National Biography, “had it been
bigger it had been kinder.”
But whether or no you should deem it º to heal my
wounded pride with a fresh supply of i. den ointment (no
fleas in it this time!) I must obsequiously insist that you are
to cease these petty and ing criticisms in futurity!
Remember that the .#. Laureate TENNYSoN, in his
address to a plump head-waiter at Cock Hotel, London,
desired that he was to “trust him all in all, or not at all"—
and what is the worth of friendship if it cannot endure such
a simple test as the Confidence Trick?
I scorn to justify myself! Good Champagne wine needs
no gooseberry bush—and I can well afford to let sleepy dogs
go on with their lying.
Having thus placed my bone of contention in your Honour's
eye, we may consider the incident closed, and I will promise
not to again allude to so sore a subject.
Except by saying that, if you should consider my said
É. address too farfetched for plausibility, that is simply
ause you are making late Lord SALISBURY's mistake of
studying too large a map.
My own pocket ordnance chart gives the distance from
Korea to Port Arthur as not more than one inch, three
quarters.
But to me it is the matter of total indifference whether it
is an inch or an ell! It is enough for me that I have safely
traversed it, and not on mere Punch business—but as bearer
of secret instructions from my hon’ble friend Col. KHAKIMONo,
who (being only a native of Nippon) has more implicit confi.
dence in my veracity than certain sceptical European
editorial quidnuncs'
For it seems he has been stuffed up with flattering tales
of hope from Tokyo War Dept. that Port Arthur was
in the pretty kettle of fish, if not actually in the soup; .
being desirous of somewhat more . information, he
requested myself to proceed on the spot, and bring him back
my impressions of the final cataclysms.
So, being duly furnished by him with passport, Cook's
circular return coupons (available for one month only) and
introductory epistles to the Governor and Port-Admirals, I
started for my hazardous mission, on pins and needles lest,
like backward grass, I should not come up till after the
starving steed had been stolen.
But hoity-toity! my fears proved to be totally chimerical,
and already I am convinced that Col. K. has been too
pºintly counting a chicken which is not yet even new
a101 :
For, so far are the inhabitants from contemplating the
slightest surrender that they do not admit that they are at
all inconvenienced by so trumpery a bombardment—but are
§: precisely as though in times of peace! [ED. CoM.—
We feel a delicacy in venturing any remark that might further
wound Mr. JABBERJEE's feelings—but it is really too obvious
that his circumstantial description cannot have been based on
personal observation; he seems to have been inspired by
certain telegrams which were being circulated, about a month
ago, from St. Petersburg.]
I have secured a suite of apartments, with excellent view
of bombardment, as pensioner at above hotel, and am trans-
ported with amazement at the general tranquillity and gaiety.
The Bathing Season is now in a full swing, and the Prome-
made and fashionable pastrycookshops are full as an egg with
elegant beau mondes and élites, while there is not a backseat
to be hired in any of the theatres.
At night the entire neighbourhood is brilliantly illumi-
nated by splendid searchlamps.
LATER.—There are pleasure yachts which will, for cost of
one rouble per head (children half-price) take excursionists
on a sailing jaunt round the Japanese blockading-junks, but
I have not yet accomplished this trip, owing to § fact that,
at present, the fleet is not yet in sight, to the inconsolable
disappointment of all visitors. -
Even when it does appear on some offing or other, I am
informed that their bºi. are so amateurishly aimed
that they fall ludicrously short, to blush unseen in un-
fathomed ocean caves. It is true that one cannon-ball did,
a few days since, descend into a goat-sledge which was
stationed near one of the bandstands—but fortunately the
vehicle was untenanted by any puerile occupant, and the
goat, though severely shaken, is now able to return to his
ordinary duties.
I am utterly astounded at the temerity of Hon'ble Admiral

antagonists, including some cricketers.
THE LOAMSHIRE Point of VIEw.
The wicket was never good; it was
awful when I was in.
RUMJIBUNJI batted freely.
The ball often broke.
C. B. RoAST had no luck.
The grass was green.
I could not get my eye in.
BOBBY CAIN gave no chances.
We drew stumps exactly on time.
A. C. MACNYREN,

THE BUMPSHIRE Point OF WIEw.
The wicket was superb.
RUMJIBUNJI was very cramped in style.
The rain kept off.
C. B. Roast was very lucky.
MACNYREN got his eye in at once, but

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 9–
Occasionally gentlemen below the Gang-
way, who know more of Parliamentary
strategy than their pastors and masters
soaring aboveit,complain of C-B.'s tactics
in Parliamentary warfare. All concede he
had a happy thought when he selected
THOMAS §: to move rejection of
Licensing Bill. The Member for MoR-
PETH, a constant attendant on Front
Bench, rarely offers a contribution to
debate. Almost morbidly modest, he is
hard to move from the conviction that
what he has to say on any particular
topic is not worth troubling mankind
with. Nevertheless — perhaps conse-
quently—there is none the House would
rather hear than the ex-Secretary to the
Board of Trade, who, as he mentions
for the information of students of Dod,
“commenced working in coal pits at an
early age.”
Following the Howe SECRETARY this
afternoon he held in close attention the
largest audience of the sitting. His
deep, musical, Northumbrian burr recalls
a countryman, colleague, and friend who
long since left us. BURT has not the
eloquence that adorned the infrequent
speeches of JoE CowPN. . That was a
thing apart. The quaintly - dressed
scholar and man of letters who sat for
Newcastle-on-Tyne through the seventies
was the last of the born orators found
below the Gangway. Another, a con-
temporary who predeceased him, was
P. J. SMYTH.
But though the ex-collier, who has
represented MoRPETH these thirty years,
makes no effort at winged flight of
oratory, his speech has excellent literary
flavour, the sentences being perfectly
turned, weighty in argument, informed
by high personal character. The speech
ut a powerful spoke in the wheel of the
É. on this its first turning.
Business done. — Debate on Second
Reading of Licensing Bill opened. The
Lords busy with Education Bill intro-
duced by Bishop of St. ASAPH. A pains-
taking, ingenious device to ease the dead-
lock in Wales created by Education Bill.
Right Rev. brother of St. DAVID's gave
judicious measure of support. With
the Welshman speaking in the House of
Lords and the Northumbrian addressing
the House of Commons one had flashed
upon him sudden vision of the variety of
race, each with native tongue, who people
a geographically insignificant island.
“What line is St. DAVID's taking?”
SARK asked a noble Lord who was quit-
ting the House.
“I am not quite sure,” said the ir-
reverent Peer. “As far as I can make
out he is reading in, his native tongue
an early Welsh manuscript.”
“ExcelleNT LITERARY FLAvoup.”
Mr. Th-m-s B-rt.
House of Lords, Tuesday.—
“No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest. Go, pronounce his
present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.”
Thus the LoRD CHANCELLOR. And as
he murmured the words of DUNCAN, King
of Scotland, he unconsciously put on
royal air. The hand imperiously waved
toward Lord CAwDoR conveyed subtle
impression of holding a sceptre.
House generally in state of uproar
unfamiliar in the placid atmosphere.
Noble Lords on both sides cried “Order!
Order!” just as if they were in the
House of Commons, and the gentleman
on his legs was an Irish Member.
Lord M-rp-th follows the Member for Morpeth.
CAWDOR}looked round in blank amaze-
ment. What was the matter? Had
they all gone mad? Had Birnam Wood
untimeously come to Dunsinane? Had
Macduff cried aloud the weird secret of
his birth before receiving the cue?
CAWDOR really didn't know; all he was
conscious of was that, he having risen
with intent to say a few words, here was
the whole House at his heels like a pack
of hounds, the LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR
mysteriously wagging his head and
pointing at unseen things on the horizon.
As he stood with blanched cheek
staring at demented Thanes, one whis-
pered a word in his ear. Clapping his
hand to his head he found it was true.
In deep thought he had risen from his
seat without removing his hat. Hence
this outcry.
“Wouldn't you also like to put up your
umbrella?” a noble Lord sympatheti-
cally whispered in his ear from a back
bench.
A pleasing incident, varying the
austere respectability of the Chamber.
In the Commons it is not an unusual
thing for a Member strolling out to a
division to forget to remove his hat.
The uproar that follows puts in the
shade the emotion displayed by noble
Lords to-night.
Affair brought into prominence pecu-
liar difference between procedure in two
Houses. The LORD CHANCELLOR, though
he draws an additional £5000 a year for
presiding over legislative Chamber, is
not endowed with disciplinary authority.
Had the third Earl of CAwDoR still
been Lord EMLYN, with a seat in the
Commons, his apparition with his hat
on whilst he addressed the Chair would
have been met by stern cry of “Order!”
from the SPEAKER. All the LoRD CHAN-
CELLOR could do was to wave his arms, at
first sight suggesting to the bewildered
Chairman of the Great Western Railway
the idea of a station porter directing the
shunting of a train.
Business done.—Lord CAwdOR forgets
to take off his hat.
House of Commons, Wednesday.—
Commons had their burst of uproar

for posterity, and throwing in a bit of

prepare one as short as possible. The
stone-cutter after profound thought
suggested the following:—

The legatee, mindful of the condition
of the bequest, but careful for shillings,
spent a sleepless night in effort further
to reduce the inscription. At length

Startling Occurrence in a Post-office.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am not subject
to hallucinations, and this is what hap-
pened. I stood in the spacious hall of a
post-office. Beside me a fellow citizen
was transacting business with an official.
Some slight error occurred, for which
the official was to blame; imagine my
feelings when I heard him pronounce
these extraordinary words to the cus-
tomer: “I beg your pardon, Sir.”
Oh, Mr. Punch, Sir, is the Millennium
near?
Yours in deep respect and agitation,
A PLAIN MAN.
MORE SUSPICIONS.
It is hinted in the Lobby that Mr. Swift
MACNEILL is in possession of information
which gravely affects the character
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
An Irish Member chanced to be making
a small purchase at a tobacconist's when
the Chancellor came in, and after buy-
ing a twopenny Borneodora observed to
the assistant, in a markedly significant
manner, “It’s a fine day to-day,” thus
implying that it might not be a fine day
for the tobacconist on the morrow. The
next day saw the introduction of the
Budget. Mr. MACNEILL, it is under-
stood, will put a question on the paper,
and, save in the highly problematical
case of a satisfactory explanation, will
afterwards move the adjournment.
The energy of Mr. McKENNA is said to
have unearthed another highly suspici-
ous circumstance. The story is that on
enquiring at the Civil Service Stores he
found that on the day prior to the
Budget Mr. Joseph Chamberlain's house-
keeper purchased two pounds of 3s.6d.
tea in place of the one pound she usually
bought. The attention of the Chan-
cellor will be drawn to the growing
practice of forestalling, and to move a
resolution.
Lord LANSDowne's latest indiscretion
will possibly be noticed on the Foreign
Office Vote. Just before the publication
of the Anglo-French Treaty, Mr. WEIR
saw the Foreign Secretary and the
French Ambassador drive up to the
Foreign Office in a hansom. Lord
LANsdown E allowed the Ambassador to
pay the driver. Mr. WEIR says that of
course he does not imply that the sur-
render of British rights in Morocco is a
direct consequence of this, but he
remarks very justly that it is most un-
desirable that an English Secretary of
State should be under financial obliga-
tions to the Ambassador even of the most
friendly nation.
On Doctor CLIFFORD's last visit to
Oxford a reliable informant remarked to
him that there had been a great increase
in the quantity of firewood supplied to
All Souls College recently. It is believed
that Sir WILLIAM ANSON, in anticipation
of an increase in Welsh Martyrs on the
Education question, is trying to corner
the faggot market. As Sir WILFRID
LAwson observed with a touch of old-
world humour, “His prophets and ours
are both at stake.” But, jesting apart,
there are in this case the elements of a
very ugly scandal.

[May 18, 1904.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW GAME.
[The papers announce that the Thibetans
were to be seen “firing jingals from a jong
into our camp.” Since reading this the writer
has lost all interest in other and simpler
matters.]
TIME was I cared for cricket, golf,
Bridge, billiards, and ping-pong;
Cutting a ball to the ropes for four,
Doubling a spade to the sixth or more
When things were going wrong;
But now I spend my evenings off
In jingal-firing—from a jong.
Of old I had my hopes of bliss
The coming years would bring:
Lunching at large with a peer or two,
Filling Whpage in the last “Who's
O ”—
You know the kind of thing;
'But now my only joy is this—
To fire a jongal from a jing.
Though editors despise my pen,
And saxpences go bang,
Creditors seize my only chair,
Prison authorities cut my hair,
I do not mind a hang:
So long as, every now and then,
I fire a jungle from a jang.
And, when upon my life you see
The final curtain rung,
With reverent head and on bended
knee
This be the verse you grave for me'.
“Here lies unwept, unsung,
All that is left of Jones—N.B.
He fired a jangal from a jung.”
BATES.
BATES once told me that when he was
a little boy he invariably took off his
gloves if, on getting into an omnibus or
railway carriage, he found his fellow-
passengers were without those articles
of attire. He did it, he said, out of
consideration for their feelings. I was
inclined to doubt it at the time, never
having met the class of little boy to
which BATEs would appear to have
belonged; but I can quite believe it
now—since I presented BATEs with that
continental tobacco-pipe.
I bought it in Milan. Its clumsy
head, made of some sort of imitation
meerschaum, was surmounted by a
hinged lid of metal of equally doubtful
composition. Its wooden stem tapered
off into a cork, which was supposed to
fit into the head, but didn't. The
genius who devised it had, however,
provided for this peculiarity by moorin
the head to the middle of the stem wit
a short cable of green cord, adorned
with several tassels. Its mouthpiece
had originally formed part of the horns,
or the hoofs, of some animal or other.
I only smoked it once. If you so
much as attempted to hold it in your
mouth, its weight made your teeth ache
in five seconds. If you held it by the
bowl, it burnt your fingers. If you
held it by the stem, the head at once
dropped off and was brought up by the
j. a jerk that sent the burning
tobacco all over the carpet. Perhaps
the genius meant you always to smoke
it with the lid shut: but, so arranged,
no person of ordinary lung capacity
could make it draw. And, when it did
draw, the flavour of tobacco was entirely
lost in a combined sensation of over-
heated earthenware and singed horn.
I came to the conclusion, with mature
consideration, that perhaps, after all,
it was not intended for a pipe, but
for a present. Then I thought of
BATEs—my dear, polite friend BATEs—
and remembered that I had returned
from Italy' without bringing him any
little souvenir of my visit.
I presented it to him. “I’ve had
one pipe out of it,” I said, “just to
take some of the newness off, you know.
I thought you wouldn't mind.”
“It's really very good of you to
have remembered me,” said BATEs, as
he carried the pipe away, “very good
indeed—come round some evening.”
I went round one evening—perhaps
a week later. I expected that he would
have had a struggle with the thing—
brief but decisive, as mine had been—
and would then have wisely hung it
up over his mantelpiece as a curiosity.
I should also, had it been anyone else
but BATEs, have been prepared to
exercise due caution in accepting any-
thing in the shape of a cigar that
might be offered me.
“Now,” said BATEs, taking the pipe
out of a drawer, as soon as we were
comfortably settled in his den, “now
I'll start. I thought that as you had
been so good as to bring this all the
way from Milan for me it would be
º courteous to wait until you came,
and celebrate the initiatory rites in
your presence. I’m not much of a
smoker, you know.”
“Aren't you?” I said, uneasily; “in
that case, perhaps—”
“What?” asked BATEs, filling the
capacious bowl.
“Nothing,”I replied. “I thought you
might prefer—
“Cigarettes? Nasty things! Give
me a pipel” exclaimed BATEs.
“I #. I remarked.
“And had a try at it, what?” said
BATEs.
“Once,” I said. “I wish I hadn't!”
“Oh, I don't mind at all, my dear
fellow,” said BATES politely, as he struck
a light and began puffing away.
I did not want to see him suffer, but
I did not know what more to sav. But
somehow BATEs got on with the horrible
machine much better than 1 had done.
He it firmly by the stem, and
#.º. not Hil off; it seemed to
draw beautifully; he threw back his
head and smilingly blew rings with
every appearance of enjoyment. It was
I who suffered, and I was greatly
relieved when at length he knocked out
the ashes, and, examining the pipe
critically for the fiftieth time, said,
“Thanks awfully, old man; it is indeed
very uncommon.”
esently I rose to go, and BATES
accompanied me to the front door. The
gardener was waiting in the hall.
“Ports,” said BATEs, “will see you
down the drive, old chap; it's rather
dark. Good-night!”
I was marvelling at the extreme
courtesy with which BATEs treated his
guests, when Potts began to talk.
“I’ve had a rare job all this week,”
he said, “with that there forren pipe
you give to Mas'r BATEs. What wi'
piecing it together wi' string, and
blowing shag through it every morning
in the greenhouse to get the taste out of
it, till I were fair sick—I wouldn't take
it on again, no, not if you was to give
me five bob, I wouldn't.”
I paid Potts the amount of his
damages. On the whole I think I
prefer moderately rude people to such
a “pine-apple of politeness” as BATES.
TUBEROSES.
[A controversy is now raging in the columns
of the Daily Mail as to why, when the Tube is
full, some ladies are offered seats while others
are not. The statement of one correspondent
that she is permitted to stand because she is
young, pretty, and healthy-looking, has natu-
rally roused resentment in the hearts of those
who have been offered seats.]
WHEN the Tube is replete,
And there isn't a seat
Each morn as I travel to town,
Some gallant I find,
Judiciously kind,
Who rises and lets me sit down.
I smile, and he raises his hat—
And I publicly certify that
. à #: ‘. twenty
f graces I’ve plenty,
And that's why she's fºur-
The Cat!
It's an error, forsooth,
To imagine that youth
Is the only essential that pays;
Why, a babe at romance
, Stands a very poor chance
When matched with my womanly
ways.
It's the charms that are ripest
that please,
And I know, as I sit at my ease
In the seats they surrender
With glances so tender,
They're longing to offer
Their knees.

aristocracy, who, if not all celibates, show such a rigid regard
for propriety, that, when staying a night or so in the same
hôtel—“The Fortress” at Antwerp (we do not recall it)—
with the ladies of the Court, these high-minded noblemen, in
order to avoid the faintest breath of scandal, insist on occu-
pying the left wing of the building, while the charming
Countesses and Duchesses, of various ages and sizes, are all
“in their own right” quartered in, apparently, first-floor
rooms on the opposite side of the building. These titled
ladies and gentlemen observe so stately and dignified a
bearing in their dealings with one another that it seems as
though either they were only the most casual acquaintances,
or their cool manner towards each other, individually
and collectively, was the result of some deadly quarrel. Of
course it may be their artfulness, and the nobles may be in
reality the sliest of gay dogs, and the ladies the most hypo-
critical hussies. But we would rather not think so; let us
have one illusion left. So excellent, however, is their courtly
tradition of politeness, that in public they are all in complete
harmony. A musical triumph for HANS RICHTER.

Faust. M. CotREUIL cleverly takes the part of Wagner;
Gounod knew what he was about when he gave Wagner an
eccentric bit of music and then cut it short; artful. Under
the safe conduct of Signor MANCINELLI Faust finished
| famously. Crowded house, for Faust is an old favourite,
very hard to beat.
Altogether, on reviewing the first three weeks of the
operatic season, the Singdicate may certainly shake hands
with themselves at Whitsuntide, when those of their audience
who can do so give themselves a few bars' rest and a change
of air; and when, for those who can't, the Covent Garden
Management is able to provide both frequent change of scene
and continual change of air.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Letters from England (SMITH, ELDER) were written by
Mrs. GEORGE BANCROFT, and cover the term during which
her husband, the historian, filled the position of American
Minister at the Court of St. J*: It *
ſº during the late Forties, a period full of social,
<é. literary and historical interest. Under , the
jº. direction of a lively, keen-eyed lady, to whom
ſºs everything in the old world was startlingly
º tº fresh, we get vivid peeps of well-known
>k<! personages. Among the portraits, lightly
* sketched, are those of MAGAULAY, the Duke of
CAMBRIDGE in his prime, the Baroness BURDETT-CouTTs, then a
comparatively young thing known as Miss ANGELA CouTTS,
Mr. and Mrs. DISRAELI, Sir GEORGE GREY, Lord MoRPETH, Lord
LANSDowne, Tom MooRE, and, not least informing, the Prince
Consort. There are many notes of contact with Queen
VICTORIA, then in the full bloom of early married life. My
Baronite is especially delighted with the reference to Lady
SUFFIELD. Belonging to one of the oldest high Tory families,
so opposed was she to innovations that when, consequent
upon the opening of a railway, her letters arrived at seven in
the morning, she would never allow them to be opened till
two in the afternoon. All her life, through mail-coach days,
they had been delivered at that hour, and she was not going
to change her habits because men made railways that ran (so
they said) at the rate of twenty miles an hour. Like Queen
ANNE, Lady SUFFIELD is dead, and has consequently been
spared much suffering in the way of electric lights, electric
trains, motor-cars, and dinner at half-past eight.
To all who are at the present moment interested in
Japanese movements—and who is not?—the Baron per-
suasively recommends the perusal of a little book, brightly
written, by CoNSTANCE TAYLER, entitled Koreans at Home
(CASSELL & Co.). The illustrations are both “plain and
coloured.”—the coloured individuals there represented being
mostly uncommonly plain. The authoress is an observant
raconteuse, of a ready pen and wit. One among many
striking pictures is that of “An unmarried Korean Boy.”
This boy looks like a girl, and his age might be anything
in the 'teens. Now, that one unique individual should be
singled out from among all Koreans seems to imply that
most Korean boys are married, and that this gay young
bachelor, of, say fourteen or thereabouts, is a rare exception
to the rule. The authoress, evidently appreciating his lone-
liness, shows us also a young “unmarried girl,” who is
evidently the very helpmate suitable to the aforesaid boy-
bachelor. Early marriages, it seems, are encouraged in
Korea: and, apparently, so also is serious flirtation; as in
the very same plate is a portrait of a “Kisso or Messenger.”
Now what does the name of “Kisso” suggest? Lip-service.
And if Master Kisso be “a messenger” is it not clear that
he must be an employé of Korean Kupid? The Baron leaves
the solution of this Korean problem to intelligent English
readers of both sexes. The “Emperor of KoREA” (p. 41), who
looks here like a mechanical doll, may remind not a few of
one of those quaint figures which that excellent ventriloquist,
the late “Lieutenant CoLE,” used to such amusing purpose
in his highly-popular entertainment. Facing p. 15 is a
delightful portrait of “a Korean Bridegroom,” who appears
to have been awakened from slumber rather too early in the
morning, and therefore has had only barely time to don a red
dressing-gown, easy slippers, and to balance a tall-crowned
straw hat, several sizes too small for him, on the top of his
head, before going out into the street. If he be receiving
visitors his attitude towards them must necessarily be very
stiff, as the slightest nod on his part, not to mention any
attempt at a bow or a shake of the hand, would immediately
imperil the position of the hat. Altogether a most amusing
and interesting book.
Messrs. CHATTo AND WINDUs publish The United States
in Our Own Time, appropriately named, since the work is in
form and style closely modelled on JustiN M'CARTHY's History
of Our Own Times given by the firm to an appreciative world.
Mr. BENJAMIN ANDREWS, sometime President of Brown Uni-
versity, is now Chancellor of the University of Nebraska.
But there is nothing of the Professor in his way of writing.
He is delightfully chatty, teeming with information, telling at
rapid pace the marvellous history of the United States from
reconstruction in 1870 up to the close of last year, which he
notes as the date of expansion. The pages are full of pen-
and-ink portraits, rapidly drawn with skilful hand, of men
whose names are familiar to the British reader. The interest
is increased by some five hundred illustrations, chiefly from
photographs, snapshots of faces and places. A chapter my
Baronite finds of special interest just now is that which deals
with the question of Chinese immigration to California. An
Irish immigrant named KEARNEY led the crusade against his
yellow brother. “The Chinese must go,” was the opening
phrase of KEARNEY’s multitudinous speeches, a declaration
that never palled on the ears of the excited mob.
In writing. A Race with Ruin (WARD, Lock & Co.),
Mr. HEADON HILL had his eye on a plot for a melodrama for
Drury Lane or for the Adelphi, should the management of
the latter theatre determine upon returning to its old line
of business. Here in this ...”. miching malecho with a
vengeance, and matter sufficient for, say, quite a couple of
thorough-going melodramas of the deepest dye, with the
possibility of more than one powerful sensation scene, which
would give the stage-manager, the scene-painter and the
mechanist some fine opportunities. As to actors' chances,
they are innumerable. From the experienced Romance and
Novel Reader's point of view, which is also that of the astute
“Skipper,” the one serious fault in this melodramatic work
is that the shadows of coming events are too clearly cast
before them. By those virgin minds, however, that still
retain their pristine innocence of all criminal procedure and
proceedings, the sufferings of the victims, the energy of the
good, the wiles of the villains,
and the dodgery of the detec-
tives, will be found matter
exciting enough to keep their
attention awake long after the
hour of bed-time has sounded.
But for “nous autres " c'est
vieux jeu. By the way, there is
a vieux jeu in it, who is as ex- |
ceptionally good a character as
the kindly old Mr. Riah in Our
Mutual Friend, who was intended
by DICKENs as a set-off against
the villainous Fagin.

M. BOUDIN IN ENGLAND.
No. VII.
WE were walking, Boudin and I, the other day in Piccadilly
just where that street begins its slope westward from Devon-
shire House.
“Come, Boudin,” said I, “you must admit that a street like
this is hard to beat. Of course I know what you'll say—”
“Then I will not say it,” he broke in. “It is stupid like
a mutton to say something when the other man he know it
before you say it. Therefore I guard the silence, my bulldog
of Piccadilly, I guard the silence the most profound.”
“Why so touchy, Boudin?” -
“Touchy! Moil Ah, by example, there is what is
good. No, it is I, Boupin, who say to you, ‘Speak, my brave;
you have the word and you can speak what you will. Praise
your Piccadilly, for I admit it is a beautiful street, and I, for
my part, I will not pronounce in a whisper the name of the
Boulevard, which is, sapristi, a beautiful street also. And
so we are both happy, you because you love your Piccadilly,
and I (but I am, it seems, doubly happy) because I love your
Piccadilly and my own Boulevard also,'” and he began to
sing a refrain :--
“Tric trac, quand cava bien -
Dans ma boutique, j'aime la musique.
Tric trac, quand gava bien
J'aime la musique --
“What a song-bird you are, Boudin!” I thought it best
to interrupt him, for the people in the street were all begin-
ning to turn round and stare at my young friend, who was
trolling out the song at the top of a pair of by no means
feeble lungs. He saw through me, however.
“Ah, you do not like your little Boudin to sing. Très
bien. You say it is inconvenant to make music in full air in
this so magnificent Piccadilly. The other bulldogs do not
like music to sound in their ears when they go to sell their
wives at Smithfield, for you know, my good friend, they will
all sell their wives at Smithfield; it is your English custom.
And le Lor Maire will be there to see that there is a fair play,
is it not so, hein 2"—and he began again, but in a lower
voice—
Il y avait un milor de Londres
Bien gras, bien solide,
Quise fit diablement tondre—
“It is a little poésie which I compose, but I have not finish
him yet. He shall describe the customs of the English as they
exist at this hour, and every word shall be the true truth—
Pour les maris c'est bien commode,
Tantarata, tantarata.”
“Look here, Boudin,” I said with determination, “if
you're going on like a primo tenore gone mad, we shall be
taken up by the police. If you must sing, let's get into a
hansom.”
“A hansom ' " he cried in a tone of terror; “ah, but no - a
thousand times no. We will go–you and your friend
Boudis, so respectuous and so devoted- we will go in an
omnibus, in a four-in-hand, in an automobile, or even in a
growlair, but in a hansom-no, no. I am a man of much
courage. I am ready to go on the terrain with my wife's
grandfather if I marry and my wife's grandfather (I hope
she have one) say me any injures—but in a hansom I will
not go. I love life, and the English meesses are blondes and
amiable, and Piccadilly is beautiful, and one day I hope to
see ce beau pays de France once more. No, in a hansom I
do not enter.” -
“But, my dear Boudis,” I said laughing, “surely that's
absurd. Why, there isn't a smarter sort of conveyance in
the world than a hansom. We are rather proud of them,
I assure you, for London is practically the only place where
you can find them, and as for danger---"
A PERSONAL GRIEVANCE.
“I say, won't They LET You Go INTo LoNG TROUSERs?”
“Now I tell you, my fine fellow,” said Boudis eagerly,
“you are wrong. If there are no hansoms in foreign cities
it is because they are not all fools in foreign cities. Possibly
they have seen a hansom and they do not like him. And
I do not care for the smart. I like my top-hat best, and
when I enter a hansom, vlanſ it is done with my top-hat. It
was a top-hat, but now it is an omelette, it is a marmalade,
it is everything which a top-hat must not be if it is still to
be a top-hat.”
“Oh, that's all nonsense; it's all your own clumsiness.
And that doesn't make a hansom dangerous.”
“As to the danger, I tell you. Yesterday I make a
promenade in St. James's Street. It has rained a little, and
the hansom-cab horses they all make a glissade down St.
James's Street. It is a very clever thing to teach your horses
to patiner down St. James's Street, but as for me it returns
me the stomach to see them. Sudden a hansom-cab come
running very quick and he make collision with a growlair.
The growlair fait culbute, but no one is hurt. As to the
hansom-cab horse, he fall down and an old gentleman with
spectacles on his nose, who was inside, he describe a parabole
and fall on the back of the horse, and the coachman he
describe a bigger parabole and he fall on his own back, and
the old gentleman have cut his face with glass and he say,
‘Take me home to ma mère. I never go in a hansom again,'
and he faint. And the poor coachman he is pick up by two
policemen, but he say no word. When I see that I say,
‘Boudin, my friend, we have in Paris some nice fiacres like a
little barouche; you shall go in them, but if you love your-
self you go not in a hansom'—and, by blue, I do not.”

Or blithely urge afield my panting moke.
I would that I could couch on Margate's strand,
Pillowed upon my HARRIET's heaving chest,
And watch her large and speaking smile expand
Under the pseudo-AEthiop's hoary jest.
These are the human joys of men; but oh,
I could not imitate them if I tried;
There is a something bids my soul forego
The hallowed levities of Whitsuntide.
'Tis not that I have d my active prime,
Or ache with Weltschmerz; not that I have seen
Too much of men and cities in my time,
Or that the East has petrified my spleen.
Life has her remnant spoils still worth the chase;
My health is fair; my appetite excels;
I have not quite outworn the buoyant grace
That one associates with young gazelles.
Yet can I not assume the jocund air
Of general holitime; for I confess
That I am never wholly free from care
During a Parliamentary recess.
Barely I brook the time, however short,
Through which my stricken country stands alone,
Prey to a Cabinet, by all report,
The worst and most degraded ever known.
What devilry may ForsTER have in store,
When for the nonce that rival figure pales—
Lloyd-GEORGE, our future Minister of War,
At peace among the spouting schools of Wales?
Picture what schemes these vermin mice may brew
With Robson (cat) no longer on the spot,
CECIL not there to teach them Who is Hugh,
WINSTON away, the judge of What is What.
And yet I must not grudge their hour at grass;
Only the gods dispense with Nature's law;
No mortal, though the thing were made of brass,
But needs at times to lubricate his jaw.
Meanwhile, till that return for which Ipine,
May Heaven inject new unction in their souls,
Then give me back, like giants fresh with wine,

Lord Actox. 4 pp. : :
My experience at the Opera on Wednesday night was not
altogether productive of unmixed enjoyment. The opera was
Tristan und Isolde, by the German composer WAGNER, and
in his treatment of the old world legend on which it is
founded I missed a good deal of the simplicity which consti-
tutes the chief attraction of the Homeric poems. . . . The
tone of the story, which is concerned with the fortunes of
a distressed Irish princess, I found regrettably pagan, the
element of amativeness being unduly prominent throughout.
GEORGE RUSSELL, who shared our box, was much shocked by
the absence of any definite theological motive, and left us
early in the evening. . . . After the second Act we were
introduced to the prima donna, an Italian lady of considerable
vivacity, with whom I had some interesting conversation on
the manufacture of macaroni, the cooking of polenta and the
prismatic stratification of Neapolitan ices. I have little doubt
from what she told me that the word bombe, used in culinary
operations, is connected with King BoMBA of infamous
memory, whose addiction to the pleasures of the table was
notorious; unless, indeed, it is to be traced to ERASMUs's
phrase of the Chimaera, bombinans in vacuo. . . .

help §. it a great pity you should give up tennis for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
º being a comparative neophyte in the science
of military sneaking. Then I opportunely recollected that
a civilian friend at Calcutta, BAboo OPROCASH SHEEKHUR, had
very kindly presented me, thinking that it might be perhaps
of use in war-reporting, with a small handbook of Aids to
Scouting, composed by Hon’ble Major-General BADEN-Powell
in the midst of Mafficking.
Consequently I have accepted Col. K.'s challenge, and am
confident that, by dint of assiduous cramming up of the
aforesaid volume, I shall at least acquire sufficient smatterings
to scrape through with honours.
LATER.—Hip-hip-huzzay! After diligent perusal of the
above pamphlet, I find it as easy as a play of dolls! Already
I possess a working majority of the necessary qualifications
for a scouter. Am I not “smart, active, and intelligent”;
“willing to turn my hand to any kind of jobbery”; a “good
rider” ” (this I am soon to become, since my Sho-ji is now,
owing to compulsory abstinence, quiet as an unborn lamb).
As to the article of Pluck, this, I am encouraged to find, is a
quality which is, almost always, inside every man, and only
needs developing and bringing out.
A. I have already purchased a secondhand patent
Sandow developer, for yen 7 sen 50, from one of my fellow
reporters. I must also be able to “keep hidden and take
care of myself” (which I humbly think I am fully competent
to do), and of my horse (which I will do, with his kind
permission). In addition I am to “sketch and report informa-
tion.”
Now, as a sketcher, I do not claim to be a Sir FREDERICK
LANDSEER, that I can paint a Derby Dog Day, or yet an
Hon’ble TURNER, R.A., to represent a Railway Terminus, with
train and passengers complete.
Still, I have, more than once or twice, depicted for the
amusement of my olivebranches, not only trees but even
cows and horses, with such lifelike verisimilitude that they
were easily enabled (after a little prompting) to identify
same !
Then it seems that a scout should learn Hindustani—which
of course I already speak with fluency. . . .
LATER.—Before making my start, it has been necessary to
train Sho-ji to lie down on the word of command, and I am
delighted to find that he is of marvellous docility and intelli-
gence. (I forget whether I mentioned that I purchased him
from a Korean Travelling Circus Proprietor, who was selling
off, owing to loss of business through War Panics.) For it
is now only necessary to say, “Sho-ji, the Russians are
coming!” and he rolls over with the deadness of mutton |
As the signal to rise, I have merely to kick him in his
abdomen and say, “It is only the MIKADO !” whereupon he
erects himself on all fours. After which I can, generally,
contrive to leave the stable before I am nipped. .
LATER.—Col. K. is becoming slightly impatient,
to know when, if ever, I intend to make my start.
I have replied that I am now in marching order, and have
offered to take a selection of my rival correspondents in my
rty as pupils. What a pity that they are such poor white-
ivered unenterprising chaps as to unanimously decline with
thanks! . . .
Col. K. has just generously presented me with my rations
for four days. By a singular coincidence, they exactly
correspond with those mentioned in the Hon’ble Major-
General's textbook, viz., a live sheep, and my helmet-full of
best quality flour!
I must confess that the Hon’ble and gallant Author was
not far out in his assertion that such a commissariat is apt to
roduce a certain horrified “what-am-I-to-do-with-this-little-
ot?” expression on the recipient's visage. But he is totally
wrong in adding that I was “to consider myself in clover,”
since I am not an Admiral Crighton to ride a horse and drive
a sheep at the same time !
requesting
Fortunately, it is the sheep who is now in clover, having
absconded itself into an adjoining field, in defiance of my
exhortations.
But, not being an inveterate meat-eater, I am by no means
to fondre en larmes at such defection, as I have sufficient
flour in my solah topee and pockets to make several chupatties.
According to the book, I am first “to take some steeple or
broken-down gate as a landsmark, and work from that.”
But how is this possible in such a barbarous land as Korea,
where the sacred edifices are unprovided with steeples, and
there is no such thing as any agricultural gate, in good or
bad repair?
Again, I am to find out the North Pole by dint of the Sun
and reading the hands of my watch. But suppose, owing to
parsimony of my proprietors, I have been compelled to leave
my fine gold repeater timepiece with some Korean uncle or
other—please, how then, omniscient Military Mister? . . .
LATER.—I have come to the halt—after riding for all my
worth. At first, a gentle walk along the high road, gradually
increasing to a trot—then to a wild and neckbreaking tittup !
Every now and again my faithful piebald would imagine
(erroneously) that the Russians were coming, and lie down
instantaneously, without waiting for any signal. Whereupon
I also would dismount, being careful, following textbook tip,
to make my clothes “as near the colour of my background as
possible.” Such occasions I have generally utilised to make a
map, or depict the sceneries and other objects of local interest.
Also (as recommended) I have permitted my pony-crock
“to refresh himself by a roll in the dust or mud”—though
I did not anticipate that he was to roll on myself as well!
But I do not think I have incurred any vital internal dis-
placements, so—who cares?
Next, as the Major-General advises, we have been across
the country—though not at my original suggestion.
Now I am once more alone, as §. has either absented
himself without leave, or has taken his cover so cleverly that he
is practically an imperceptible. No matter! I will do the
remainder of my scouting on foot.
I have got back to some highway. A good opportunity
to do some ‘sign-reading' by guesswork! . . .
ExAMPLE I.—Ground: A well frequented road in Korean
locality. Dry—gravel—some mud. Atmosphere: Warm. No
breeze. Time: Afternoon. Getting on (1 should think) for
Japanese tea-hour. Sigms: Fresh hoofmarks. (Remark:
Fresh, because, if there had been any rain, they would be
washed out.) Feetmarks. (Human, because heels on boots.
Not Korean, as they wear carpet slippers.) Dust disturbed :
several hoofmarks together. (Therefore more than one horse
—probably several.) Semi-circular dents on ground. (One
or two of the cavaliers must have sat down.) Tufts of coarse
hair on bushes—some reddish brown, some white. (Not
Japanese or Korean hairs, which are black as a crow. There-
fore, European. Only Europeans in neighbourhood, Russians.
Cossacks have rather red coarse hair. After a certain age it
would turn white; therefore, both old and young Cossacks
have recently passed.) Patches on road of some white sub-
stance—flour. Military tents in distance. (They have been sent
out to get flour.) But said hoof and feetmarks point in
opposite direction to encampment. (A stale dodge, and old as
the hills | They have simply shodded their steeds stern fore-
most, and walked themselves backwards !)
DEDUCTION: I am close to some hostile Cossack camp.
Their supplies must be dwindled to a shadow. Else, they
would not be so short of flour, and would have at least
sufficient Petrol-oil to keep their hair on. A senile and
juvenile Cossack have been sent out to procure forages.
They have got some flour. Being famished, they have
º for its possession. Their respective steeds have
likewise become cantankerous. Both Cossacks, owing to
sheer debility, have sat down in the dust. Argal—the

encampment is so reduced as to become
the easy booty'. . . . Where is Hon’ble
Sherlock Holmes now? . . . -
NotE-The above proved to be nearly
right. Only, as it happened, the encamp-
ment turned out to É. Col. K.'s head-
quarters. Said Col. expressed himself
as highly delighted with my report. It
is true that certain envious rival reporters
have pronounced the said hairs (of which
I brought back samples) to be of equine
origin. But, as I said to them, “What
proof, Misters, is there that the Enemy
is mounted both upon white and red
quadrupeds?”
I am, composing, a rather flowery
testimonial to Hon'ble B.-P., with per-
mission to publish same (free of charge)
in next edition of Aids to Scouting.
LATER.—Sho-ji turned up later, utterly
exhausted by his scouting excursion. I
have been compelled to call in a Korean
vet., who reports that my unfortunate
crock is suffering from severe nervous
prostration. I enclose his bill—a very
quaint, almost undecipherable document.
P.S.—Account unfortunately mislaid,
but net total, yen 25—which please
settle. I cannot afford to pay for such
working expenses as horse-balls, which,
I assure you, are not by any means a
mere drug in Korean markets!

PRESENT:
Dr. J. A. H. Murray (in the chair).
Prince Ranjitsinhji.
Mr. Charles Frohman.
Mr. Augustine Birrell.
Mr. W. S. Gilbert.
The Chevalier de Rougemont.
Mr. Henry Chaplin.
Madame Yvette Guilbert.
Dr. Clifford.
Dr. Murray. We are met to-day, in
solemn conclave, to do what we can to
strengthen and colour the language by
the addition of new and picturesque
words. A more representative gathering
I have seldom seen.
The Chevalier de Rougemont. Hear,
hear!
Dr. Murray. Everyone should invent
a new word—like Boycott and Marconi-
ram, Mesmerism and Spoonerism.
rd Avebury would have us say “many-
where.” It is not, perhaps, good, but
better than to invent nothing.
Dr. Clifford. You think it better to
have invented a bad word than never to
have invented at all?
Dr. Murray. Certainly.
Dr. Clifford. But bad words surely
should diminish in number?
TRAPPED.
Benevolent-looking Elderly Party. “Do yor Like Children, Miss?”
Superior Governess. “Oh, I Don't MIND THEM.”
Elderly Party. “No.
So I SEE 1."
Dr. Murray. I don't mean bad in that
sense. The last bad word in that sense
was Assouan – the biggest dam on
record. Very useful for golf.
Mr. Chaplin. The difficulty is not so
much inventing new words, as getting
people to take them up. I invent lots,
but they will perish with me.
Madame Yvette Guilbert. But will you
perish 2
Mr. Chaplin. Not exactly perish, per-
haps. Eacegi monumentum, don't you
know. But I should have liked some
of my coinages to stand. For example
I once called a spade a spade. That
was a very daring innovation.
The Chevalier de Rougemont. I see
that Mr. FRANCIs GALTON has been lectur-
ing on Eugenics. What are they?
Mr. Chaplin. Eugenics is the science
of perfecting the next generation.
Prince Ranjitsinhji. I suppose the
word derives from my friend EUGENE
SANDow 2
Madame Yvette Guilbert. Let me see, is
there not a proverb which says, “When
you are in Frome you must] do as
the Frohmans do?”
Mr. Frohman. Where is Frome? Is
there a theatre there?
Dr. Murray. I think it's in Wiltshire,
where the bacon comes from.
Dr. Clifford. No doubt FROHMAN
originally meant Frome-man, a Baconian.
Hence his interest in the legitimate
drama.
Prince Ranjitsinhji. Every great man
should add at least one word to the
language, just as my friend P. F. WARNER
has done. Who ever heard of a Plum
wicket until he showed us how to play
forward on one!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Mr. W. S. Gilbert. In this connection
I should like to say that poets cannot be
too teful to Prince RANJITsINHji for
his own contribution to the vocabulary.
Until he made it possible to refer to
innings of RANji's the stock of rhymes
to Ganges was very low.
Dr. Murray. Sometimes it takes two
cricketers to form a word—as in the
case of bowling which is more than
broken by the batsmen, and is, in fact,
FRY-ABEL.
[The tea interval was here taken.
Mr. Augustine Birrell. Had it not
been for me and my obiter dicta
the pastime of birrelling would be un-
known.
Prince Ranjitsinhji. What we all
wish is that Mr. BIRRELL would indulge
in birrelling more freely. On my recent
tour in India I found the Sikhs in
despair about it.
Mr. Charles Frohman. Instead, he
“gives up to party what was meant for
mankind.”
Mr. W. S. Gilbert. And thus—to use
another word derived from a man-
burkes our enjoyment.
Chevalier de Rougemont. Surely “tur-
tle” is as good a word as “hurtle.” If
a man can hurtle through the air, why
cannot he be said to turtle through the
Hippodrome?
Dr. Murray. Turtle, however, is not
a proper name. A better word was the
variant of “rhodomontade " which
cropped up some time since—“rouge-
montade.”
Mr. W. S. Gilbert. I can sit here with
a perfectly satisfied mind, having pro-
vided the language with the excellent
adjective Gilbertian, which saves critics
and journalists so much trouble. I
have noticed that no South American
President can do anything without
being called Gilbertian in the head-line
ress.
p Madame Yvette Guilbert. Guilbertian'
—I 'aif not 'eard it. But it is a good
word. I will take it back to Paris with
Ine.
Dr. Murray. Look at the other ex-
cellent words we have obtained from
men of note, such as, for example,
Bridge from Sir FREDERICK BRIDGE,
and the Green Park from Sir GILBERT
PARKER.
Mr. Frohman. Yes, and the Marble
Arch from Mr. William ARCHER.
Mr. Birrell. And Lake Windermere
from Sir Charles WYNDHAM.
Dr. Clifford. That reminds me of a
riddle : Why is Sir CHARLEs WYNDHAM
like England 2
Mr. Chaplin. I give it up.
Dr. Clifford. Because he has had
trouble with the boo-ers.
[Ambulances having been brought in,
the party left for home.
ALIEN IMMIGRANTS.
|Sir LEEs KNowLEs has received a letter from
the nervous father of a boy at an English
public school. The boy's name is down for
Oriel, but in view of the unfair competition to
be expected from Rhodes scholars the writer
is liń. to send him after all to Cam-
bridge. The argument of the letter is here
carried a step or two further.]
O WILLIAM mine, no tongue can tell
What raptures in my bosom centred
When on the books of Oriel
Your youthful name I first saw entered.
With pride and pleasure freely mixed
My fond paternal heart was swollen;
I thought of you as something 'twixt
A mighty Milo and a SoLON.
Triumphant still I pictured you
Between the goals and at the wicket;
With ease you were to win your blue
For football, rowing and for cricket.
Putney should know you, Lord's should
ring
When on the field your men you
posted,
And Queen's Club cheer like anything
The bravest forward Oxford boasted.
Nor was your prowess in the field
To mar your scholarship—far from it!
Your bright career was not to yield
In brilliancy to any comet;
And when you reached, say, twenty-
three,
Replete with academic knowledge,
I thought you probably would be
Created Provost of your College.
But now the quads are over-run
With great Rhodes scholars—huge,
gigantic-
They hasten from the rising sun,
They cross the billowy Atlantic.
William, I tremble at the thought
That even in a friendly tussle
Your fragile figure should be brought
In contact with such fearful muscle.
And oh, my little one, what hope
That Youth which numbers eighteen
sunliners
In classic lore can ever co
With these maturer-brained new-
comers ?
Under the new and fatal rule
Oxford must weep to see her glories
All pass to aliens in the school
Of Literae Humaniores.
I sigh, my son, to picture you
Amid these learned men of letters,
Striving to grasp their point of view,
And vying vainly with your betters.
If Isis suffer such unfair
Conditions, who would ever blame us
Should we decide to go elsewhere,
And seek the juster courts of Camus 2
Yet even there come Scotch M.A.'s,
Men who have dared to wander darkly
By KANT's and HEGEL's hidden ways,
And know by heart their HUME and
BERKELEY.
Hindoos of supple mind and wrists
Swarm from the Empire's utmost
fringes
To oust us from the wranglers' lists,
And give our Blues to RANJITsINHJIs.
WILLIAM, I would not have you vie
With men so much more wise and
witty,
And therefore let us rather try
A junior clerkship in the City;
There we may find a spot that's free
From preternaturally bright lights,
Where you, my WiLLIAM, yet may be
A candle 'mid the lesser night-lights.
TAMING THE SEA.
No one who dwells exclusively on land
can have any idea of what it means to a
traveller on the Atlantic to have the
monotony of the passage broken by news
of home. Of old one said good-bye to
newspapers at Sandy Hook or Queens-
town, and reluctantly and sadly settled
down to the difficult task of getting on
without them for a week. In those days
one was driven to the boredom of read-
ing books. But now all is changed, for
the genius of Signor MARCONI is to make it
possible for a newspaper, with the title
of The Cunard Bulletin, to be published
at sea every morning, containing all the
news of the day. Marvellous are the
prizes of civilisation' How much better
than to be ignorant of home affairs is it
to be able to read such marconigrams as
these:--
“Rain stopped play at Lord's at
# Glamorganshire have a lead of
138.”
“Mr. C. B. FRY is still undecided
whether or not to play for the Gentle-
men.”
“A woman at Devizes has celebrated
her 105th birthday.”
“There were eighteen hours of
bright sunshine at Brighton yester-
day.”
“The rumour that Mr. BALFour will
stand for King's Lynn at the next
General Election is unfounded.”
Meanwhile rivals are in the field.
We hear already of the White Star
Gazette and Bibby's Babbler; while the
Messrs. HARMsworth are busily engaged
in completing plans for a mid-ocean
intelligencer of a more natural character
—no less than a trained school of swift
cachalots, which will leave Queenstown
every morning, bearing news to whatever
liners they can find. The news will be
printed on a small leaflet which these
ingenious mammals will spout on to the
first-class deck. The leaflet, edited by
Mr. F. T. BULLEN, will be entitled The
Daily Whale.

“DEAR Dolly” (wrote HARRY)—“Let's
go to Princess's. I believe it’s quite a
nice place to go to. I used to be able to
scratch about a bit at school, and you,
of course, are great at skating as at
everything else, so I'll come round for

“P.S.—Put on something warm.”
I was delighted to hear that HARRY
was a skater; personally I am not great
at it, but a supporting arm covers a
multitude of slips, and I may mention
we are engaged.
The band was playing pretty German
waltzes when we arrived, and through
the glass doors of the entrance lounge
the circling skaters seemed to keep time
to the soft throb of the music, and the
skating simply took my breath away.
Each graceful figure swerving past
must, I felt convinced, be a champion,
but HARRY assured me the artificial
ice made it so easy that we should be
astonished at our own performances.
We were. Hand in hand—skates on,
and impatient for the floor—we clumped
to the side of the rink and stepped
over the edge. I have never been quite
sure whose fault it was. HARRY says it
was that idiot instructor chap with the
fur cap, who looked as if he were going
to run into us. Possibly it was my fault,
but probably it was HARRY's-anyhow,
what happened was this. No sooner
had we stepped over the edge than
HARRY made a sudden wild dive forward,
as if he were going to butt down the
barrier, dragging me with him; then,
flinging himself upright, he plunged
backwards, still grasping my hands, so
that I was compelled to duplicate all his
movements; he then wrenched me side-
ways, hit me hard in the back, and sat
down with me so violently that my teeth
rattled in my head. -
Igazed at him speechless; he returned
my gaze and smiled foolishly.
“Sorry, Dolly,” he said ; “let me
help you up.”
He scrambled to his feet, and taking
my hand fell on top of me three times
running, until in terror I crawled awa
on all fours lest worse should befall,
and assisted by the instructor in the
fur cap I arose, and stood trembling
and clinging to him.
If HARRY could have managed to get
up without using his feet it would have
been easier; however I suppose he
couldn't, but eventually he stayed right
end up, and the fur-capped instructor
glided away, while the passing skaters
cast resentful glances upon us, as we
stood innocently dividing the ceaseless
procession.
“Never mind, Dolly,” said HARRY
cheerily; “better luck next time.”
“Perhaps so,” I replied, “if we don't

go together.” I started off alone, and
by dint of taking tiny strokes and
bringing the other foot down again as
uickly as possible I got once round
the rink and found myself gripping the
handrail and trying to look as if I was
not suffering. As a matter of fact the
gnawing anguish in my legs was intense,
and owing to the extra things I had
put on I was roastingly hot. The sway-
ing melody of the band mocked at my
pain, and in bitterness of spirit I watched
the accomplished crowd gliding by.
Suddenly I saw a lane open in their
midst, and down the middle of it came
—HARRY, his arms now outstretched
now flung upwards, as he lost his
balance one moment, and recovered it
the next, the shock and jar travelling
wave-like all up his body. From the
look of relief on his perspiring face and
his desperate efforts to hurry I saw he
was making for me. I turned and fled.
aware of a series of thuds, and presently,
safe for the moment from pursuit,
stopped to rest. The fur-capped in-
structor paused as he glided by, and
in answer to my smile approached with
the suggestion that “Mademoiselle might
like a leetle instruction ?”
Mademoiselle jumped at it, metaphori-
cally speaking, and from that moment
the prospect grew rosier. Guided and
supported by strong and intelligent
hands my movements became easy, not
to say graceful; the music was delightful,

he suddenly shot one foot forward,
reared himself back, stamped a large
hole in the ice with both feet, and with
a sinuous movement all up his back-
bone, kicked high in the air and col-
lapsed. I have heard people say that
HARRY is too stiff and unbending; that,
I think, was not the general opinion at
Princess's.
“Mademoiselle will be injured,” said
the instructor, drawing me away; and
basely enough I went. I felt heartily
ashamed of HARRY. The refined, con-
temptuous stream of skaters carefully
avoided him, and, as he rose to his feet,
hand was wrenched from hand, and
couples flew apart to make way for his
approach.
It was at 10 o'clock, when they were
clearing the rink for the quarter of an
hour's waltzing, that I called to him to
come and sit down. At first he did not
hear me, and I was shocked at the
change that had come over his expres-
sion. He was getting on better, but I
intelligent, distinguished face could ever
express such utter imbecility. His smile
was fixed and vacant, his body unnatu-
rally rigid, and the feeble fluttering of
his legs pointed to early senile decay.
“Jolly good fun, isn't it?” he said,
as with a sigh of relief he sank down in
the cushioned chair beside me.
“It’s coming back to me now, and
I'm trying to remember some of our
old school tricks. Hallo! they're waltz-
ing. Come on, Dolly, we've never
missed a waltz yet.”
I clung desperately to my chair, and
coldly pleaded fatigue. I was wretched.
It seemed as if I knew HARRY for the
first time, and I kept saying to myself,
“How can I ever marry him '''
The waltzers retired, their quarter of
an hour over, and for a few minutes
before the ordinary skating was resumed
the rink was practically empty.
“I used to be able to scratch along
backwards,” said HARRY: and, with the
rink practically to himself, he started to
have “a try at the old dodge,” as he
called it.
From the opposite end, a charming
little lady, graceful as a swallow,
came skimming down the rink outside
edge backwards. HARRY had gained
a wonderful momentum from his own
convulsive plunges. Back to back they
met-–the force of the shock sending
them to opposite sides of the rink in
horizontal attitudes. The lady was
quickly surrounded by eager cavaliers,
but HARRY, seizing the hand-rail to draw
himself up, was unable to get his feet to
stop underneath him, and his skates
struck the woodwork of the barrier with
a sound like the rattle of, musketry;
Even the band stopped to laugh, and
leaning over the barrier I hissed between
my teeth:
“HARRY, I'm going home.”
I waited for him in a secluded corner
of the entrance lounge, desperately reso-
lute that no power on earth should make
me marry such a blundering, half-
witted clumsy clown'
Glancing up, my eyes rested on a
man walking away from me, and I
sighed enviously at his distinguished
air and stately demeanour. He turned
—it was HARRY | -
HARRY – calm, elegant, dignified,
though a little pale and worn. If the
coat makes the man, then skates make
the fool. I took his arm rapturously.
“HARRY,” I murmured, “never bring
me to this place again!”
“I won't,” said HARRY.
Later on they sent in a bill for floor-
ing, panels and glass, but we were
married then, so nothing mattered.

Essence of PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 16.
-Wasn't for nothing that Sir FRANÇis
S. Powell had SHARP bestowed upon him
at baptismal font as a second name.
He met the situation to-day in manner
prompt as it was wise. For mous autres
it was a little depressing.
Second reading of Budget Bill moved.
C.-B. challenged with amendment con-
demning large and continuous increase
of national expenditure; brought down
with him sheaf of notes defining posi-
tion. Truly appalling even when read
from MS. Went back to year 1895, at
which period the nation was re-endowed
with Unionist Government, strengthened
by accession of Dissentient fiberals.
In the nine years intervening, leaving
out of account two hundred and thirty
millions, cost of war in South Africa,
there has been an addition of forty-nine
millions per annum to ordinary ex-
penditure'
Anyone curious to discover his per-
sonal, household, share in the little bill,
will find it tot up to an added taxation
per head of £13s. 4d.
“The population,” said C.-B., sum-
ming up case in memorable phrase,
“has since 1895 increased by ten per
cent. ; expenditure by fifty per cent.”
It doesn't need a cool calculating head
like that of the late Mr. Micawber to
work out sum showing where in course
of time this process will lead the
wealthiest nation in the world.
Almost more striking than these
colossal figures was attitude of custo-
dians of public interest. A rare summer
afternoon blazed outside, illuminating
the dusty roads, glorifying the spring-
robed parks. Urgent Whips brought
down Members in hundreds ready to
snatch a division or resist attempt

according to their honest intentions.
Meanwhile they nurtured these last on
the Terrace, where they tarried whilst
C.-B. told his terrible story to almost
empty benches.
THE MINISTERIAL “CAKE-WALK" INTo THE RECEss.
The Balfour Administration reaches the Whitsuntide Holidays with huge majorities still to
its credit in vital divisions.
No more damaging indictment of a
long-lived Government has ever been
delivered at Table of House of Commons.
PRINCE ARTHUR, lolling on Treasury
Bench with, to do him justice, genuine
indifference, met attack by a move
of saturnine sarcasm. To attempt an
answer would have tested to utmost his
own unrivalled skill in evading reply
whilst making a speech. St. MICHAEL
thanked All Angels that it was not
his duty to stand up in defence of a
habit of reckless expenditure fought
against throughout his guardianship
at the Treasury, before whose accumu-
lation he had retired in despair. At the
Old Bailey Bar it was a familiar axiom
when one had no case to abuse the
plaintiff's attorney. Whelmed by the
appalling story substantiated by official
figures related by C.-B., PRINCE ARTHUR-

It is dogged does it with a CAVEN-
DISH. Cavendo tutus, he will face any

committed to him as PRINCE ARTHUR this
afternoon, with winsome smile, lightly laid
on Victor's back. Lowering his head,
squaring his shoulders, he plodded along,
showing how the undeniable increase in
. expenditure was directly due to
neglect on part of Liberal Party, who,
save for a brief period of three years,
have not been in office these eighteen.
It was at this period Sir FRANCIS
SHARP Powell justified a Parliamentary
reputation, founded in days as remote as
the time of PALMERSTON. He dropped
fast asleep. As his head fell back he
from time to time woke with what
envious people said was a snort, but was
really a note of admiration at the con-
vincing argument of the Financial
Secretary to the Treasury.
Business done.—Second Reading of
Budget Bill moved.
Tuesday. — Two pretty episodes at
to-day's sitting. The first when PRINCE
ARTHUR laid a garland on the freshly-
dug tomb of his uncle the MARKiss.
“This for remembrance.”
It came about in form of address to
His MAJESTY praying that a monument
to the late Premier may be set up in
Westminster Abbey. As Leader of the
House it fell to PRINCE ARTHUR's lot
to submit motion. He did it in a
speech which, as C.-B. heartily said,
will remain a treasured possession of
the House. Its beauty was based on
a firm foundation of simplicity, of
unaffected reverence for a great man
who chanced to be of near kin. With
the perfection of art that conceals art
the brief speech was delivered without
notes, thus adding the final charm of
spontaneity.
In a long procession of successes this
flash of genius will hold high place. It
was more than an intellectual triumph;
it was the revelation of a fine nature.
The other incident followed when
SQUIRE of MALwood-cuM-NUNEHAM had
made an end of speaking in debate on
Budget Bill. A not too crowded House
listened with respectful attention, almost
affectionate interest, to what, possibly,
may be the last of the veteran's charges
in the Parliamentary list. When he sat
down up gat HARRY CHAPLIN, who, thirty-
six years ago, entered the House with
the SQUIRE, and has since missed no
opportunity of beating him about the
head. Now, amid general cheering, he
expressed the profound regret with
which the House looked forward to “the
snapping of another link with the past,
the removal of another great ornament
of the old school.”
This is the true Parliamentary spirit
that, in spite of party passion and some
personal littlenesses, ever maintains the
lofty tone, the courteous manner of the
Mother of Parliaments.
Business done.—C.-B.'s amendment
on Budget negatived by 297 votes
against 213.
Thursday. --The Right Honourable
Sir WILLIAM HART DYKE, Bart., bustles
about the House to-day as if it were not
forty years ago next Session that he first
crossed its threshold. The MEMBER For
SARK well remembers him in the 1874
Parliament, when, in colleagueship with
Rowland WINN, he was Whip in Dizzy's
first Government. Eleven years later, the
Conservatives coming in for a brief spell
of office—Don José, in unregenerate days,
scoffed at “the stop-gap Government”
—Rowland WINN, the junior Whip, was
made a peer. “BILLY” DYKE, to cite the
name by which he is affectionately
known in the House, was at same time
impaled on the horns of dilemma ever
sharpened at Dublin Castle. When in
1895 his Party came in for a real long
run of good luck, the faithful servitor
was shelved.
SARK not the only man in House who
thinks “BILLY” DYKE has been scurvily
treated. Perhaps the only man who
doesn't take that view is the modest-
mannered, loyal-hearted ex-Whip. Whilst
other flotsam and jetsam of reconstructed
Ministries washed up on back benches
have cunningly sought opportunity of
revenge, never once, under whatsoever
tempting circumstances, has “BILLY”

QUEEN both present, and a good house to do honour to MozART's
ever fresh melodies. Le Nozze is a comedy first and an opera
afterwards; it ab–
solutely requires
first-rate high and
low comedy acting.

ful rehearsing,
directed by an in-
spired stage-mana-
ger, might produce

who was to have been Il Conti, being unfortunately ill,
couldn't appear as the Conti, and so M. jo. substituted

character, which for this Journet is quite a tour de force.
Dr. RICHTER, who, as an honest man, will be no party to the
concealment of hidden treasure, has restored the aria “Il
Capro” to Marcellina, to whom, in Act IV., it properly
belongs, and Mlle. SYLVA made the most of this golden
opportunity.

Madame MELBA, although suffering from a cold, “has kindly

heroine of VERDI's melodious and dramatic Rigoletto, to hear
which the house was crammed from floor to roof. Madame
MELBA showed no sign of having a “ dasty cold id 'er ed";
she did not even carry in her right hand the tiny mouchoir
that is the consecrated property of every conservatively
trained prima donna. She sang her “a's" and “c's" and
“d's" with ease; without a sneeze. She was brilliant.
Evidently the
warmth of her re-
ception must have
driven away the
cold from her
throat. Our music-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
At first, in E. McNULTY's Maureen (ARNOLD), the characters,
as sketched, and the dialect, in queer English, representing
Irish as popularly supposed to be spoken, lead the reader
to expect a rollicking story of Hibernian life and character,
such as was long ago represented, more or less truly, but
always amusingly, by CHARLEs LEVER. No, not a bit of it;
the breeziness soon subsides: the froth fizzles off, and the
remainder is as flat and as acid as a glass of fifth-rate
champagne that has stood for an hour or so on a sideboard.
Naughty Nan (WARD, Lock & Co.), by John LUTHER LONG,
is an interesting story, with a strong sensational infusion,
told however in so eccentric a style and with such affected
mannerisms as seriously to imperil its success. By the way,
who ever heard of a clerical candidate “receiving his orders,”
that is, being ordained ' A Bishop confers orders, i.e.
“ordains,” and every one is familiar with the phrase “taking
orders.” But “taking his orders” has the smack of the
commercial traveller about it, and suggests the question,
“whose?” The narrative style adopted by the author is rather
suggestive of what might result from the pen of an imitative
admirer of Dolly Dialogues and Dumas.
In Theodore Roosevelt (HopDER AND STOUGHTON), Mr. Riis
does not attempt to produce a life of the President of the
United States. As he says, it is alike too early and too late
for such a work. Too late for details of his career, since
everybody knows them; “too early to tell the whole story of
what that strong, brave life will mean to the American
people.” Accordingly, through 450 pages, he gossips about
him as a man and a citizen. He has the advantage and the
disadvantage of long intimate acquaintance. As my Baronite
discovered on a recent visit to the White House, Washington,
to know THEoDoRE Roosevelt is to admire his intellectual
force, and be drawn by the simplicity, yet strength of his
personal character. Mr. Riis, knowing him from boyhood,
maintaining the intimacy through the rough
rider's steady, irresistible advance to the
highest position the world provides for a citi-
zen, finds it difficult, if not impossible, to
vary the note of eulogy. This is apt to be
monotonous. But the tendency is overlooked
in the interest of the story and the vivacity
of the incidents of which it is made up. There
are nearly a score of photographs and other
illustrations, dating from the time when young RooseVELT
was at Harvard to the day when he was seated in the Pre-
sidential chair.
My Nautical Retainer desires once again to acknowledge his
indebtedness to MARY Johnson, author of that fascinating story,
By Order of the Company. In her new novel, Sir Mortimer
(CoNSTABLE), she goes back a little further to the times of the
best Elizabethan buccaneers. We plunge at once into the
very heart of things. Given two gallant sea-captains, who
exchange a mortal challenge on the eve of sailing together for
the Spanish Main, but from a public sense of duty and of
discipline put off the settlement of their private quarrel till
the expedition shall have come home; given a fair and
gracious lady of the Court, who learns, an hour later, from
one of these that she is the monna in nominata whose beauty
and virtue he has made famous in song; and with these high
issues of love and hatred alike indefinitely deferred, the author
from the very outset has the reader almost mercilessly in thrall.
And indeed he must have a courage scarce less than Sir
Mortimer's to face outrageous fortune and the proud man's
contumely, though at his darkest hour the gloom is for a
moment lifted upon as noble a picture of pure loyalty in love
as you shall find in any page of English romance. But the
end more than atones for the long and pitiless ordeal.
If it is not ungrateful to offer a word of criticism, one
might say that the author's style betrays a tendency to affec-
tation, as in the little trick of inversion by which she throws
her verbs forward in front of their subjects; that she has
allowed herself to overlay the narrative (told by herself) with
the euphuistic embroidery of the period; and that she some-
times permits the colours of her backgrounds to become rather
obtrusive. But it is a book of which she has every right to
be proud; and indeed when one reflects upon the proofs
here given of her possession of those qualities so rarely found
together—a man's strength and a woman's tenderness—it
would be hard to name a living writer, of either sex, who
could have written it for her.
Major W. P. DRURy, in his Peradeentures of Private Pagett
(CHAPMAN AND HALL), seems, in the Baron's opinion, throughout
this book, by making the supposed narrator of the stories an
ex-private of marines, to have aimed at achieving a success
similar to that attained by Mr. W. W. JAcobs in his most
humorous series of semi-nautical coast-trading tales. There
is, too, which is in character with a marine, a flavour of
KIPLING's private soldier's slang: decidedly objectionable.
As to the stories themselves, the Baron is bound to admit
that, reading them with the very best will in the world, they
seem to him hopelessly unintelligible, and, therefore, abso-
lutely uninteresting: save two, namely, one entitled “The
Signal Guns of Gungapore,” which might and ought to have
been a fine, weird, imaginative -
legend; and the other called “In
the Bay Flat,” which is the better
told of the two. But real interest
in stories narrated by a man who
is “accounted a painstaking and
promising liar by the sea-faring ſº
profession—the profession best ſº-
ualified to judge,”—is, from º
the commencement, discounted.
Maybe, if the Major could forget
JACOBs and KIPLING he might tell
something in his own style that
would catch the public.

LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
“WiTH THIS RING I'll THEE wed.”
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
SCENE – A Law Court. Mr. Justice
SPRIGHTLY on the bench. TIME –
Second day of the hearing of
Browning v. TUPKINS, an action for
infringement of copyright. A
crowded and fashionable audience.
The plaintiff, Mr. Robert BRowNING
—a poet tolerably well-known except
in the Law Courts—is in the bor.
Mr. STUMPER, the eminent counsel,
is cross-examinang.
Mr. Stumper. You contend, I under-
stand, Mr. BRowNING, that the defendant's
poem “Applause” is stolen from your
lines called “Popularity”? You con-
sider yourself an authority upon that
subject? . . . Well, one would not have
guessed it. And you allege that
these lines of yours have some literary
value? . . . Indeed, that is most inter-
esting. Perhaps, then, you will explain
their meaning to the jury. Here is a
line, for instance: “Mere conchs' Not
fit for warp or woof!” [Laughter.
The Judge. Mere what?
Mr. S. “Conchs,” m' lord. Perhaps
the plaintiff can enlighten us—ah, thank
Oul.
The Judge. The plaintiff seems—er—
a little shellfish too.
[Loud and prolonged laughter at this
brilliant witticism.
Mr. S. Then the meaning, I take it,
is that these winkles—(Laughter)—are
not “fit for warp or woof”—are we to
understand that most shellfish can be
used in decorative needlework? . . .
Come, you need not be angry; I am
asking for information only, you know.
Well, we will go on to the next verse.
...And there's the extract, flasked and
fine, and priced and saleable at last.”
Is that poetry? . . . No, I don't want
you to express your opinions about me,
but to answer a simple question. . . .
Thank you, so that is your idea of
poetry. Now we can get on. “And
Hobbs, NoBBs, Stokes and Nokes com-
bine.” [Loud laughter.
The Judge. Hobbs? Anything to do
with the Leviathan 2 [Renewed laughter.
Mr. S. And who is Nobbs? Friend
of yours? . . . Only a type? Well,
that is disappointing. (Laughter.) And
who are Messrs. Stokes and Nokes?
Your solicitors, by any chance? (Laugh-
ter.) . . . Oh, no offence meant. So
they're only types too? “Hobbs hints
blue—straight he turtle eats.” Will
you be good enough, Mr. BRowNING, just
to “hint blue”—for the enlightenment
of the jury? (Laughter)—Well, your Mr.
HoBBs did it, you know. Then “NoBBs
prints blue.”
The Judge. Blue-letter type, no doubt.
Laughter.
Mr. S. “Who fished the murex up?”
Is that a riddle? . . . But you must
know, if you wrote the poem. And then
the last line: “What porridge had John |
KEATs?” (Prolonged laughter.) Why
porridge, Mr. BRowNING 2 And who was
John (KEATs—another type? . . . Oh, a
real poet this time? And what does
this line mean—or has it no meaning at
all? . . . And you consider that all this
balderdash about conchs, and porridge,
and Nokes and Stokes and murexes and
KEATs really deserves to be called poetry?
. . . Thank you; you can stand down.
[At this point the Jury intimated that
they had heard enough of the case,
and returned a verdict for the
defendant.

MASTER of that obscure infernal craft,
The work of almost diabolic wits,
Whereby the foeman, taken fore or aft,
Is meant to be dispersed in little bits,
(Or else the engineer who laid the snare
Cleaves inadvertently the ambient air):-
Loose on the high seas in an open boat
(Wide ensuing page) the limner's lines
Present your counterfeit in train to float
Another batch of detonative mines,
So that the course of any hostile ark
May be extremely tricky after dark.
Why are their lethal properties so small?
Think you this impotence is due to damp 2
Do they explode too soon, or not at all?
Or is there treachery within the camp—
Some spy that serves the enemy with maps,
Showing the sites of all your booby-traps?
There is, of course, another stamp of mine
(Which also sometimes undergoes a slump),
Built on a totally distinct design
From such as make a nervous vessel jump;
Can you have possibly confused with these
The toils we set for coolies overseas?
Nay, rather, like a hen that seeks the shade,
There furtively to drop her egg apart,
And, having done the deed and got it laid,
Blazons the fact from foolish pride of heart, -
So with the secret bombs you darkly lay,
Your instant cackling gives the game away.
And so you try, and try, and try again
To crumple up your rivals' rotten fleet,
Strewing your engines round the astonied main,
And yet their fighting strength is still complete,
Save that in dirty weather one or two
Have stove each other in--no thanks to you.
Well, cast them on the waters how you will,
The “best-laid " mines, we know, “gang aft agley,”
Yet, though their mere explosive power be nil,
Death has another move, as grim, to play;
For, while they watch the little pranks you're after,
The enemy may always die of laughter! O. S.

CARLYLE (Thou As), Historian and Philosopher, to John Ruskis,
describing his first meeting with Sir J. CRichton-Browne:
. . . . FROUDE, coming in at tea-time yesterday, brought
with him a strange Dumfries body, by name CRichton-BRowNE,
but more like a Brownie than a CRichton. The creature,
a DoN-WhiskERANDos-DuNDREARy-elongated-Edward-CLARKE in
physiognomy, has strange whimsies on sanitation and diet–
voluble in abuse of tannin and home-spun tweed. At last
Froude carried off his semi-grand hygienic Panjandrum and
left me to smoke in peace. . . . -
[Mr. WINsrox Churchill, 21s.]
MAY (EDNA), Comédienne, to GEORGE MEREDITH, expressing
admiration of his genius and asking for an autograph:
. . . . I know that for poor little Me to address such a
great man is like Mahomet going to the mountain or carrying
coals to Newcastle or anyhow something quite unusual and
absurd, but I must tell you what a flood of sunshine your
glorious books have shed on the existence of a poor little
struggling actress. If it had not been for my reading of
Diana of the Crossways I should never have dared to assume
the chief part in the Belle of New York, so perhaps you will
not think me forward if I ask you to sign your name, with
an appropriate quotation, in my birthday book, which please
find enclosed. . . . [Mr. WiLLIAM WhiteLEy, £25.]
RoseBERY (Lord), Liberal Statesman, to Miss ADA BLENKIN-
sop, Head Girl of Minerva House School, Epsom, declining
proposal that he should contribute to the School Magazine:
. . . I regret profoundly that I am unable to comply with
your courteous request. But the multifarious demands on
my limited leisure preclude the possibility of acceptance.
Apart from that I greatly doubt whether any effusion from my
unpractised pen could possibly reach the standard of excel-
lence exacted by the conductors of your meritorious periodical.
It would be inexpressibly painful for me to illustrate in my
own person the truth of the adage Sus Minervam. As a
token, however, of the profound respect I entertain for your
effort to develop the cult of belles lettres in a town so dear
to me and mine, perhaps you will do me the honour of
accepting the accompanying revolving bookcase containing
a complete set of the novels of Mrs. HENRY Wood.
[Sir William HARooURT, 7s.6d.]
WATTS-DUNTON (Theodore), Gipsy Poet-critic, to the Station-
master at Dunton Green, on the South Eastern Railway,
in reply to the suggestion that the station should
renamed Watts-Dunton Green, after the Master:
. . . . But as I have said, such a request, at once so
flattering and so just, could not have been proffered at all a
hundred years ago. It is part of the Renascence of Wonder.
In Aylwin, Chapter XXVII. (page 87 of the cheap edition,
with my portrait on the cover; page 168 of the six-shilling
edition, which I recommend)--in Aylwin, as you will doubtless
remember, I have something to say of this question and its
bearing upon South country lines. . . . .
[Mr. JAMEs Douglas, £5.]
PARKER (Sir Gilbert), M.P., Legislator, Novelist and Amphi-
tryon, to HACKENschMidt, Wrestler, declining a contest:
That strong men now and then should be pitted against
each other in friendly rivalry I should, I trust, be the last to
deny. But there are occasions when, however much one's
inclinations may persuade, one's decision must be against the
easier way. As Prince Bismarck remarked to me almost the
last time I saw him, Duty is Duty (“Pflicht ist Pflicht”), and
I have never forgotten it. On Thursday evening, the date
you suggest, I have to take the chair at the annual dinner of
the Society of Canadian Boatmen in London. Hence,
delighted as I should have been to meet you, I must respect-
fully decline. Possibly in the Ides of March we may find a
more suitable date. [MADRALI, 2s. 11d.]
CAINE (HALL), Mana: Fictionist and Statesman, to Robert ABEL,
suggesting collaboration in a novel:
While riding home to Greeba Castle yesterday I conceived
the scheme of a great cricket novel, in which the foster
brother of the Pope, kidnapped in infancy by an unscru-
pulous Neapolitan pianola player, and growing up to manhood
in the purlieus of Kennington, develops wonderful skill as a
cricketer, is elected captain of the Oval team, and performs
the hat trick in the final Cup Tie match at the Crystal Palace.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Your hon’bly idiotic suggestion,” said Col. K., with
rather too military abruptitude, “is mere hon’ble tommy rot,
since we should immediately become targets for their
entrenched musketry practices!”
“Still,” I queried, “could you not prepare them for your
attack with preliminary cannonadings?”
“That would simply be skittles,” he returned, “seeing
that we have fieldpieces of too great levity to propel balls at
all within their radius !”
“But,” I suggested, “could you not borrow bulkier
artillery from some armoured gun-junk at mouth of river?
Then, by hoisting such petards upon a hill-top, you would
infallibly obtain a more extended shooting-range.”
“Are guns volatiles,” he demanded ironically, “that they
are to fly to such altitudes?”
“You are evidently ignorant,” I returned, “that, in our
recent Boer War, hon’ble PERCY Scott invented a machinery
by which the longest Toms could be easily transported to
incredibly lofty peaks.” Whereupon I jotted a rough but
spirited sketch of said vehicle, with a few improvements of
my own. “Here,” I said rather waggishly, “are pinions for
your iron pigs' "
And, as soon as they comprehended the contrivance, they
were instantaneously metamorphosed from dismal Jemmies
to Sunny Jims, and unanimously agreed that I had indeed
proved myself the missing lynx.
Very prudently they have not permitted any grass to grow
on their feet, but have at once commanded gun-carriages to
be constructed after own design by a military carriage-builder,
and have sent down to a gun-junk, requesting the temporary
loan of its finest cannons, which are already pulley-hauled to
the summit of a commanding elevation.
At daybreak to-morrow they are to commence the ball with
a bombardment—and, though the result is still a toss-up on
lap of gods, my very slight acquaintance with military
strategies convinces me that it is to fall out in our favour.
Col. K. has very kindly invited me to witness to-morrow's
battle in his company, and offer any suggestions that may
occur to me as an amicus curiae. Which I have of course
willingly consented to do gratis.
I am inditing these lines by the sickish light of the moon,
on Shoji, who is voluntarily serving as my temporary writing-
table. I rejoice to say that my trusty quadruped is now a
valetudinarian, and will, I hope, be sufficiently robust to carry
me out of any ordinary conflict.
My thoughts are now exclusively engaged with my wives
and progenies. If, unhappily, I am nipped in my bud, what
is to become of them? It is only too probable that even
the person of a Punch representative ...if not necessarily be
sacred to a Russian sapper. However, I am buoyed up with
the inflated hope that, should Fate come with her horrid
scissors and snip off my vital thread, then you, benevolent Sir,
will officiate as loving Father to my poor afflicted families—
if only as token of remorse for having ever doubted my
eternal verities'
Now, with my Marshal's cloak around me, and my head
pillowed upon Sho-ji's recumbent stomach, I am dropping off
into a calm and serene snooze. Should Heaven be able to
spare me, and I am permitted by Censorship to lift the brazen
veil of silence, you may perhaps receive some rather sensational
reports. If, on the other hand, my destined address is on
the wrong side of Gates of Grave, you may rely on my using
best endeavours to fall with as much similarity to a soldier as
possible! -
But I entreat, sympathetic Sir, that you are not to snivel
too inconsolably over my spilt milk. . . . Good-night. . . .
MAY DAY : EARLY MoRNING.-Col. K. has just called me,
with the intimation that, if I desire to witness any fighting,
I am to tumble out. Sho-ji is so overpowered by somnolence
that he declines to rise till the very last moment. At length
he is up. . . . The nautical guns on hilltops are rending the
atmosphere with thundering loud bangs. . . . -
I have just been ferried over the Yalu in a puntoon,
together with Col. K., Staff and Sho-ji. Remainder of
Japanese forces are crossing in other puntoons. I am not
experiencing any severe sensations of funkiness. .
Candour obliges me to state that I do not perceive any of
my rival reporters on the field of battle, and can only
conclude that either they have overslept themselves, or that
they have been unable to screw their courages to the
crossing-pitch. But this, I daresay, is not to prohibit them.
from cabling highly fanciful and idealistic descriptions to
their respective journals—in which of course no mention will
be made of myself! . . .
It is a pity that I have come out without my wireless
telegraphic pole, but it is too complicated a concern to be
manipulated with impunity from the back of any horse, not
to mention that you are, as yet, not sufficiently familiar with
my secret code to make out more than very elementary
signallings. So I shall have to forward this by the customary
route—vid Calcutta.
I am supremely delighted with Sho-ji, who is undergoing
his fiery christening with the total indifference of a seasoned
war-hack! Col. K. has entreated me not to so rashly expose
myself—but not having felt any wound, I can afford to
make a joke of my scars. . . .
LATER.—The Battle is now in full blast, but so enveloped
in smoke as to be practically invisible. I might of course
very easily fake up some atrociously harrowing word-pictures,
which would be absorbed readily enough by the rather
credulous Editor of Chittagong Conch—but I instinctively
feel that you, Sagacious Sir, are too venerable a bird to
swallow such mere chaff. Also, seeing that your residuary
columns are reserved for facetious matters, I should be
committing a solecism were I to indulge in any too appalling
realisms. [ED. CoM.—We entirely agree with our Corre-
spondent, and can only commend his self-restraint.]
Still, I may perhaps be permitted to mention that poor
Sho-ji has just experienced the close shave of a cannon-ball,
which has utterly demolished his ulterior tail Luckily, he
is not in the least disconcerted by such a hair-breadth
escape. . . .
By permission of Hon’ble Col. I have harangued each
regiment before they proceed to the firing line, with brief
soldierly exhortations, abjuring them to preserve the coolness
of salamanders when exposed to hot fire. -
LATER.—Both sides have exhibited first-class gallantry—
but we have succeeded in turning the enemy on to his
º which has compelled him to fall back rather precipi-
tously.
The Russian Bear is now engaged in energetically rolling
down the darkling torrent of Fate, and retiring with grim
persistence. I am pursuing at a respectable distance. . . .
Col. K. is inclined to the opinion that the pursuit should
be suspended, as it is time for tiffin—but I have warmly
opposed such lukewarm policies, and urged him to make hay
of his foes while the sun is shining, and to smite their hips
and thighs before they are out of his touch. Which, having
now a more exalted opinion of my military acumen, he is
accordingly doing. . . .
I have just overtaken a Russian officer, and was courteously
lamenting his fortune of war, when, to my amazement, I
found that he was cockahooping with content, asserting that
everything had turned out most fortunately, since they had
succeeded in ascertaining our strength, and were getting
nearer to their base of operations !
He is immoderately amused by Japanese simplicity in not
seeing through such transparent tactics. . . .

MUSICAL JOTTINGS.
A TERRIBLE blow has befallen Professor
ERASMUs BILGER. While he was on his
way to Constantinople to give a “com-
mand” performance before the SUITAN,
the Orient express was boarded by a bevy
of Koutso-Vlach condottieri at Nish,
and little BoLESLAs BILGER, the idolised
three-year-old son of the famous Bess-
arabian composer, was kidnapped and
carried off into the Blue Carpathian
Mountains. The distracted parents were
reduced to a condition of abject coma
for several days, and could be kept alive
only by hypodermic injections of stron-
tium, nitro-glycerine, digitalis, and other
powerful explosives. Search parties
were at once organised at positively
prohibitive cost by Dr. LUNN, General
DE Giorgis, and Mr. CHARLES MANNERs.
The last-named, tastefully disguised in
the costume of Mephistopheles, is scour-
ing the mountains in every direction,
striking terror into the hearts of the
Komitadjis, and if herculanean strength
and bewitching moodiness are any
guarantee of success can hardly fail to
restore the enfant perdu to the afflicted
authors of its being.
The infant prodigy market, supplies
for which are remarkably fine in both
uality and quantity, still remains firm.
%. Friday last little EUTERPE PAPADIA-
MANTopoulo, the infant contrabassist from
Mitylene, made her début at Marlborough
House in Bottesini's thirteenth concerto.
On the previous day PAULINE MAROFAtti,
aged seven, sang the closing scene from
Götterdämmerung at a charity concert at
Grosvenor House, and was immediately
engaged by Mr. H. W. Higgins for next
season at Covent Garden. Amongst
recent arrivals at the Carlton are
Sigismund Blowsky, from Prague, aged
five, violinist; GEMMA and GIUDITTA
CoLocotRONis, twin sisters, aged nine,
harpists; and IGNAz Popper, aged three,
whose performances on the rattle have
created such a furore in the Republic
of San Marino.
On Monday last little PETzy, the
Albino child pianolist, had the honour
of playing before the Hereditary Mar-
gravine of LITHIA. The tiny toddler was
taken to Potass House in her peram-
bulator, and carried to the royal apart-
ments by her devoted parents, accom-
panied by her impresario, her advance
agent, and her bill-stickers. After lay-
ing aside her bottle with the prettiest
of baby gestures, she approached the
instrument with the decision of a diva,
and played BILGER's beautiful but com-
plex étude in F without a tremor.
There was not a dry eye in the room.
The Margravine, who was much over-
come, presented the marvellous infant
with a box of pralines, and the séance
concluded. PETzy has not a vacant date
until July, 1907, when she will be four.
Madame BAREILLY BLAMANGE, the famous
pianist, whose father, a distinguished
Mutiny veteran, named her after the
sanguinary battle on whose anniver-
sary she first saw the light, has just
celebrated what she happily calls her
pianofortieth birthday by a charming
and original party at her splendid
mansion in Arlington Street. The
entertainment comprised a serenade
by the Misericordia Amateur Orchestra,
a new Water-polonaise by the Turbine
Trio, a delicious sermonette by Canon
CoCKERELL, and a birthday ode with
trumpet obbligato written, composed, and
recited by the heroine of the occasion.
The presents included a richly-timbered
and undulating Spotstroke Cottage piano
with basaltic plinth and holophote attach-
ments from Sir ALBERT BARKER: silver-
mounted Persian kit-bag (Count Tolstoſ):
box of Borneo cigars (Cardinal RAM-
Poll.A): lb. Everton Toffee (FRANz
WEcsey). --
Mr. JAMEs MoRRELL's season of Wer-
macular Grand Opera opened at the
Neptune Theatre, Balham, on Saturday
night. The work chosen to inaugurate
the venture was Gounod's Romeo and
Juliet, but before the performance an
interesting costume lecture on the
SHAKSPEARE-BACON controversy was given
by Mr. SIDNEY LEE. The proceeds of
the season are to be handed over to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer with a view
to reducing the income tax, but at the
close of Saturday's performance Mr.
MoRRELL was able to announce that a
deficit of no less than £200 had been
realised. A special feature of the
evening was the trial of the new in-
visible hermetically-sealed talc roof
to the orchestra. The device worked
perfectly in keeping down the volume
of sound, but unfortunately, owing to an
insufficient supply of compressed air,
three members of the orchestra perished
of suffocation. Mr. MoRRELL is, however,
confident that he will be able to continue
using the talc roof without serious loss
of life. He has pointed out in a long
letter to the Times that the structure is
vegetable-proof, that it will resist the
impact of a rabbit, and reminds him
and Madame SANKEY MoRRELL, by its
chaste and corrugated appearance, of a
musical beehive.
M. PADEREwski has just returned to
Poland after spending a week at
Madame SARAH BERNhardt's marine
pavilion on the coast of Brittany. The
sport was excellent, including shrimp-
shooting with saloon pistols, crab-
stalking, &c., M. PADEREwski's biggest
bag including 14 jelly-fish, 11 mussels,
3 brace of shrimps, a small conger-eel,
and a large piece of cork. The intrepid
pianist charmed the rough fishermen by
his affability and condescension, and is
said to have composed a new Cracoviak
in their honour.
KUBELIK, acting on a hint from Mr. A.
B. WALKLEY, has decided to renew his
acquaintance with the classics, and is at
present translating Longinus on the
Sublime into Hungarian, with the assist-
ance of Count TAssilo FESTEtics, Baron
BANFFY, Count PALFFY, and Professor
ARMINIUs WAMBéRy. It is understood
that Count KHUEN-HEDERVARy, the Ban
of Croatia, will contribute a brief
preface, and that the index will be
prepared by M. PobiFDONostzEFF, the
Procurator of the Holy Synod. The
work, which will be published in crimped
lambskin at 21s. net, will be copiously
illustrated with portraits of the translator.
THE ALAKE OF ABE0KUTA'S BUSY WEEK.
May 24.—The Alake of ABEokuta,
chief of the West African Egbas, pre-
vented by the wet weather from seeing the
Zoo, visits the Colonial Office in State.
May 25.--The Alake of ABEokuTA,
again unable to reach the Zoo, inspects
the offices of the Daily Mail. Having
only thirteen orders with him he can
decorate only a limited number of the
gifted brothers.
May 26.-The Alake of ABEokuta once
more sets out to see the Zoo, but gets no
further than Lord's, where he watches a
cricket match with increasing depres-
sion. In the evening he contributes the
Abeokutan Point of View to the Daily
Mail, and gives it as his opinion that
what would make the game is bloodshed.

THE MEMOIRS OF A DIVINITY.
(Suggested by Memoirs of Sarah B. in
“Strand Magazine.”)
I AROSE one September morning, my
heart leaping with some vague thought
of coming joy. I was on the eve of my
fourteenth birthday, and I was a tall
child for my age, being about seven feet
high and as thin as a lath. You can see
this in the picture of me in the Strand
Magazine. I pressed my forehead
against the window panes, looking at I
know not what. Perhaps I expected to
see Mme. GUERARD, whom, in defiance of
sense as well as grammar, I used to call
mon petit dame. Strange that a French
girl, or any girl, should make dame
masculine ! But genius cannot be
hampered by genders!
Suddenly I heard my mother—mon
mère I used to call her—asking for
me. I plunged into bed again, and
then I heard my mother say that after
déjeuner there would be a conseil de
famille. I went into hysterics imme-
diately. As a child I was rather ex-
citable.
Then weeping I went in to lunch, and
found assembled mon tante, mom gouver-
mante, ma parrain—as I called them—
and the Duc DE MoRNY. It was a
melancholy meal; morne et MoRNY, as I
have often said since.
“Comment allez-vous?” asked the
Duc. I did not answer this memorable
question of that gay but cynical
aristocrat.
After déjeuner we went into the
drawing-room and there we found
M. LESPRIN, a friend of the family, who
always called me ma fil. The worst
thing about our disregard of genders
was that it rendered our meaning

obscure. I have never been able to
make out whether he meant mom fil,
because I was as thin as a thread, or
simply ma fille. There were also present
my uncles Félix FAURE, JULES GRévy
and CASIMIR PERIER—none of them in
any way connected with the Presidents
of the Republic. There was also a
notary from Havre, who was not only
ugly, having red hair and a face that
seemed like the back of his head, but
actually wore a pair of spectacles on his
nose. If he had worn them on his chin
I think he would have seemed less
repulsive. -
The Duc de MoRNY sat next to my
aunt, with his arm round her waist. It
appeared to me that he was carrying on
a slight flirtation with her.
“You ought,” said he, “to send this
little girl to the Conservatoire.”
He then patted my cheek, kissed my
aunt, and bowed to all the others. Ah,
what it is to be un grand seigneur !
After this he took his departure,
and I rolled on the floor and screamed.
I was an excitable child. The Con-
servatoire | What was it? A conser-
vatory, a hot-house, what we call a

wagged their heads. “Ah! Oh! Eh,
ma fil? Hum ! Hum !” said M. LESPRIN.
I shall never forget those prophetic and
wonderful words.
Suddenly someone shouted “She is
too thin ' " I immediately went into

hysterics and was carried off to bed, where I screamed ‘Au
Conservatoire l’ for sixteen hours without ceasing. As a
child I was excitable.
The next day we all squeezed into a cab–it was rather a
tight fit, but my uncles and the Duc DE MoRNY went on the
box—and drove to the Français. When we were all installed
in a loge I should have fainted from the crush if the sharp
knees of my governess, thrust into my back, had not kept me
painfully conscious of everything. Soon I began to cry.
The audience, hearing my sobs, gazed at our box. That was
my first appearance in any theatre. Then I was taken home
in hysterics. That was the début of my artistic career. An
impatient world will read of it with joyful eagerness.
THAMES WEATHER.
CoME, GEORGE, give your clubs and your Haskells a rest, man:
You can't spend the whole of your lifetime in golf;
If it pleases your pride I'll admit you're the best man
| That ever wore scarlet or teed a ball off;
I'll allow they can't match you in swinging or driving,
That your shots are as long as they always are true,
And I'll grant that what others effect after striving
For years on the green comes by nature to you.
But the sun's in the sky, and the leaves are a-shiver
With a soft bit of breeze that is cool to the brow;
And I seem to remember a jolly old river
Which is smiling all over—I think you know how.
There are whispers of welcome from rushes and sedge there,
There's a blaze of laburnum and lilac and may;
There are lawns of close grass sloping down to the edge there;
You can lie there and lounge there and dream there to-day.
There are great spreading chestnuts all ranged in their arches
With their pinnacled blossoms so pink and so white;
There are rugged old oaks, there are tender young larches,
There are willows, cool willows, to chequer the light.
Each tree seems to ask you to come and be shaded—
It's a way they all have, these adorable trees—
And the leaves all invite you to float down unaided
In your broad-bottomed punt and to rest at your ease.
And then, when we’re tired of the dolce far niente,
We'll remember our skill in the grandest of sports,
Imagine we're back at the great age of twenty,
And change our long clothes for a zephyr and shorts.
And so, with a zest that no time can diminish,
We will sit in our boat and get forward and dare,
As we grip the beginning and hold out the finish,
To smite the Thames furrows afloat in a pair. R. C. L.

OPERATIC NOTES.
Leaves from the Covent Garden.
The hit of the season up to now, according to the general
verdict, would be LEONCAVAILo's Pagliacci, as perfectly ren:
dered musically and dramatically by the cast that included
our Signor CARUso,
magnific ent as
Canio, and our
Fräulein DESTINN,
admirable as
Nedda. Signor
Scotti's Tonio is
also a fine imper-
sonation, and M.
SEVEILHAC, in the
comparatively small
part and rather
ungrateful one of
Silvio, completes a
cast which must
ever be memorable
in the Covent
Garden annals of
Operatic drama.

CINELLI juvabunt"

future time he

and so is every part of the house. Herr WAN Rooy a splendid
Hans Sachs the cobbler, in voice perfectly bootiful. Herr
HEROLD, too, excellent as Walther von Stolzing, and to
Frau EGLI as the sweet singing Eva Wagnerian enthusiasts
could go on listening “for Eva and for Eva " " As for
Dr. Head-and-HANS RICHTER his conduct in the chair leaves
nothing whatever to be desired; what he, his orchestra, and
tout ensemble fail to do, need not be attempted, elsewhere or
here for the matter of that, with any chance of success.

announced with Soprano MELBA. Signor CARUso came;
Madame MELBA unfortunately didn't. Of course a note from
her reached the management, but not the audience, who
regretted they couldn't hear from her. So without MELBA,
temporarily invalided, the house takes full value for its
money in SYLVA, as Gilda, and expresses itself quite satisfied
with the performance, seeing that there is such a tenor as
CARUso for the part of “the Dook.” Altogether satisfactory.
Opera generally going strong, in spite of the little agitato
movement of Tunes v. Times.
APPETISING.
THE Westminster Gazette announced last
week that on Monday (now past) at the KING's
Levée there would be “a number of general
presentations but only a thin entrée and a
small Diplomatic Circle.” That mention of a
“thin entrée" looked queer. It is all over by
now, but let us hope that in consequence of the
“Diplomatic Circle” being “small” there was
sufficient entrée, however thin, to go round.
The name of the entrée was not given. Some-
thing very tasty, of course.
DANGER, MINE AND THINE.-This is every-
body's danger who has a speculative turn. As
for “floating Mines” a well-known expert
observes that, relying on past experience, he
will back himself to float any mines, however
dangerous they may be (to others), and come
off with a fair profit himself.

TROUBLE AHEAD
OR, THE PERILs of THE WEEKLY ExoDUs.
[“Some Sunday, when the moon is at her lowest, and most of the
telegraph offices are closed, Germany will declare war, fall upon the
English coasts, and stab the Empire at its heart by a descent upon
London. And beyond a few messenger boys and doorkeepers and
charwomen, they will find no one in the Government offices to receive
them. All the Ministers and responsible officials will be idling in the
country, motoring and playing golf, or inspecting antiquities, or chatting
under the garden trees.”—“Sigma” in the “Daily Dispatch.”]
Saturday, May 28, 3 P.M.–Owing to dissatisfaction with
provisions of the Alien Immigration Act, an ultimatum was
forwarded by the Government of Barataria to the British
Premier, demanding repeal of the obnoxious clauses within
two hours of its receipt. The messenger, however, after
repeatedly knocking and ringing at No. 10, Downing Street,
failed to elicit a reply or to induce anybody to open the
door. The document was then taken on by a passing post-
man, with its envelope marked, “Gone away—left no address,”
to the Dead Letter Office, whence it was eventually returned
to Barataria. -
May 28, 5 P.M.–On the expiry of the allotted two hours
the Baratarian Ambassador proceeded to the Foreign Office
to demand his passports, but was unable to make his wishes
clear to the solitary occupant of the building, an ancient
dame whose hearing was impaired. She recommended his
Excellency at length to try the Lost Property Office in Scot-
land Yard, which establishment, needless to say, was closed.
The Ambassador, therefore, boarded the first train for Dover,
without taking official leave.
Sunday, May 29, 2 A.M.–Under cover of a cloudy night, a
Baratarian squadron of three submarines made its way up
the Thames to Blackfriars, where it torpedoed and sank the
British fleet there stationed. The loss of life was happily
not great, as a cabin-boy was the only person aboard. The
incident passed for the time unnoticed by the solitary police-
man on the Embankment beat. Shortly afterwards, and
before an alarm could be given, he was overpowered by the
Baratarians, who had noiselessly effected a landing at the
Temple stairs. The invaders, a party some thirty strong,
then marched through the deserted City streets and occupied
successively the Mansion House (in the absence of the Lord
Mayor), the Bank of England, the various newspaper offices,
and the Tower, where the night Beefeater was caught
napping and speedily rendered hors de combat. . .
May 29, 6 A.M.–An East End milkman got wind of the
annexation of the City by the Baratarians, and spread the
alarm through the sparsely-inhabited regions of the West.
Meanwhile the new masters of the Metropolis were reinforced
by a contingent of their alien friends in Whitechapel, and
resistance was seen to be useless. The caretakers (twenty-
three in number) of Belgravia, the forty odd housemaids of
Kensington, and the Beadle of Hanover Square surrendered
at discretion. A middle-aged cook in Mayfair was inclined
to show fight, but finally capitulated on seeing herself out-
numbered.
May 29, Noon. The back-door of the War Office was forced
without much difficulty by the enemy, though some little
opposition was offered by the Government cat. A strong
ard of three was here mounted, and a look-out was kept for
. ARNOLD-FonstER, who, however, did not turn up. The
Admiralty and other offices were similarly taken over. They
were all found to be unoccupied.
May 29, 2 P.M.–The Palace of Westminster was entered by
means of a skeleton key, and the Emperor of BARATARIA's
Proclamation to his new subjects formally read from the throne
in the House of Lords, rewarding all the pro-Baratarians with
peerages. At the same moment the Baratarian national flag
was run up at the top of the Victoria Tower. The rest of the
day was given up to rejoicing on the part of the now emanci-
pated aliens, varied with the collection of valuables and bric-à-
brac from West End mansions.
Monday, May 30, 8 A.M.–Londoners began to return from
their week-end, and learnt too late from their morning papers of
the coup d'état which had been effected during their culpable
absence from town. They had to bow, however, to force
majeure. -
DRAWBACKS.
Pity the sorrows of a minor bard,
Whose fettered spirit, emulous to vie
In leppings with the wild and wanton pard,
And, with proud head, assault the lower sky,
Now, in the bondage of a great despair,
Miltonically promulgates his views:--
Alas, what boots it with uncessant care
Strictly to meditate the thankless Muse?
Times I have had great matter for my song,
But lacked the mood to beat my music out;
Times, when I really felt like going strong,
There wasn't anything to sing about!
O Mood and Matter, uncongenial pair,
You that so oft have robbed me of my dues,
Tell me, what boots it with uncessant care
Strictly to meditate the thankless Muse?
Yet have I lived, expectant of the hour
When these proud twain in full accord should join,
Bringing me iſ. and comfortable dower
Of pleasing patronage and current coin.
O Brief as brilliant, Rapturous as rare
O Hour too slow to win, too swift to lose,
Whisper, what boots it with uncessant care
Strictly to meditate the thankless Muse?
To-day, to-day it came; it charged my blood
With the fair promise of a fruitful time;
I saw new metres bursting from the bud;
The airiest quips, the happiest turns of rhyme,
Th' inevitable word, all, all were there;
Mine was the noblest theme that one could choose;
And yet--what boots it with uncessant care
Strictly to meditate the thankless Muse?
I seized the harp; I smote the frolic strings;
Sweetly the opening prelude waned and died
Even as tho' 'twere borne on angels' wings;
My bosom swelled; my jaws were opened wide;—
There came an º: in the Square,
Grinding the engine such barbarians use!
Alas, what boots it with uncessant care
Strictly to meditate the thankless Muse?
Ah me, I could not catch him in the chase.
I could not glut my purpose to destroy;
Even to cuff him on the head and face
To me had been a melancholy joy!
Screaming, with flapping hands, and flying hair,
Scatheless he fled, and passed without a bruise;
While I - what boots it with uncessant care
Strictly to meditate the thankless Muse?
Now have I laboured through the long, long day;
My mood has passed; the jocund strings are dumb;
The World has lost an epoch-making lay,
And I, both fame and honorarium !
The chance of years has melted into air;
The Star of Hope has vanished in the Blues;
Alas, what boots it with uncessant care
Strictly to meditate the thankless Muse?
DUM-DUM.

APOLOGIA.
By the reviled spectator.
They frankly say at cricket I'm a fool,
But none shall tell me that I don't
play straight,
For every time I'll make a stringent rule
To pay my money promptly at the gate.
And though one ball will always get me
Out—
The first straight ball that leaves the
bowler's hand—
During the year I shall beyond a doubt
Be prominent in more than one “grand
stand.”
Though as a bowler I'm no good at all
(I couldn't drop a straight one if I
tried),
Yet I’ll deliver many a good-length bawl
When ºns. are going nicely for my
side.
And though my fielding's hardly worth
a glance,
This in my favour I can safely say,
I'll never through the season miss a
chance—
A chance to watch a good game when
I may.
So, though I'm not a RANJI or a RELF,
Be gentle with me, scornful playing
men ;
I'll go to watch you every time myself,
And take a maiden over now º then.
CHARIWARIA.
WE are pleased to see signs already
of a better feeling between Russians and
Japanese. The Svet, a Russian organ
which has not hitherto been remarkable
for the kindliness of its attitude towards
the enemy, last week went out of its
way to point out in the most courteous
language that a siege of Port Arthur
could only prove harmful to the Japanese.
Russia continues to appear in her
new rôle of the apostle of the Open
Door policy. She will shortly open all
the ports in her possession on the
Pacific, and has succeeded in partially
3. Port Arthur in the teeth of
apanese obstruction.
We live in an age of advertisement.
In these days of motor-car competition
it is more than ever necessary for rail-
way trains to keep themselves before
the public; and, to show that there is
life in them yet, last week the Ostend-
Vienna express ran over four persons in
succession at Bingenbrück, Bacharach,
Bischofsheim and Mayence.
A novelty at the Apollo Theatre just
now is the appearance of a new kind of
stage donkey. It has four feet.
Professor RUTHERFORD has informed the
Royal Institution that, owing to the
existence of radium, the end of the
world, which some scientists had esti-
mated would arrive in a few hundreds
of thousands of years, may be postponed
for a million aeons. We trust this state-
ment will put a stop to jerry-building.
We like to see a great man free from
pride. We learn from a recent issue of
the Express that CHARLIE SMITH, the
champion shoe-black of London, per-
mitted a representative of that organ to
hold converse with him.
A priest of the Italian Church, Hatton
Garden, has declared that anyone can
go into the Italian colony without fear
of annoyance. But where, then, do the
piano-organs live when they are at
home?
Some satisfaction has been expressed
that the Boer Congress should not have
demanded life pensions for all those
who took part in the war against us;
but it must be remembered that the
Congress is young yet.
Colonel SwayNE, Commissioner for
British Somaliland, is returning to the
country to study the situation on the
spot. It is not yet known whether the
Mad Mullah will be allowed to find an
asylum there. -
Four West African natives suffering
from sleeping sickness have been brought
safely to the Liverpool School of Tropical
Medicine. The fear that they might
recover on the voyage happily proved
groundless. -
The KAISER has informed LEONCAVALLO
that he (with a small h) is the greatest
dramatic composer of the day. This is
unusually modest of the KAISER.
Mr. T. W. H. CROSLAND has been
writing in the Gentlewoman to prove
that there are no British Humorists.
The British Medical Journal points
out that one of the penalties of consum-
ing unripe bananas is dyspepsia. One
scarcely likes to think what would
become of the nation's health were it not
for the warnings published from time to
time by the medical press.
A gentleman writes to the Daily Mail
to complain that even the refreshment-
room at the Royal Academy leaves much
to be desired. -
On Thursday last Mr. HARVEY DUCRos
succeeded in reaching the summit of
Snowdon in a four-cylinder 15 h.-p. car.
This is bad news for those nervous
people who are in the habit of retreating
to the top of this mountain so as to
avoid being run over by motor-cars.
The Poet Laureate has written an
anonymous comedietta. This opens up
the interesting possibility of his having
previously published a magnum opus
without our knowing of it.
As we go to press, some important
War news reaches us. According to
the New York Journal, the CzAR has
buckwheat cakes for breakfast, and
cucumbers scooped out and filled with
sweetbreads for luncheon, and has taken
to cellular underwear of an American
brand.
The American city destroyed by fire
for last week was Yazoo City, Missis-
sippi.
DEPORTMENT FOR TRAINS.
IN calling the attention of our readers
to a forthcoming volume under the above
heading, we wish it to be understood
that “deportment for trains” does not
refer to any rules of etiquette for the
trains themselves, these being already
fully supplied by the regulations of the
respective companies and by such addi-
tional maxims, having regard to punctu-
ality (“the politeness of engines”),
courtesy in ceding the pas to an express
upon the same line, etc., as will readily
suggest themselves.
The present Manual has for its object
the provision of a few useful hints,
collected from the best authorities, for
the guidance of those whom business or
pleasure causes to travel by rail. They
will be found of great value for the
proper regulation of conduct under
circumstances which are by no means so
easy as might be supposed. A brief
selection is given below.
WAITING AT STATIONs.
Your time being of importance, it is
the duty and privilege of the railway
company to see that your train is ready
for you as soon as you have purchased a
ticket and inspected the bookstalls. . If,
therefore, owing to negligence on their
part, you should be compelled to await
its arrival, you are perfectly justified
in expressing disapprobation of such
conduct.
This may be fittingly exhibited by the
demeanour (something between that of
a Cabinet Minister at a crisis and an
angry schoolmaster) with which you
pace the platform. Any observations
or enquiries which you address to the
officials should be delivered as loudly as
ssible, so that those passengers in the
neighbourhood may enjoy the pleasure
of sympathy.

At A REFRESHMENT ROOM.
Deportment at a refreshment room is
a matter largely dependent on the sex of
the deporter. Should you be a man,
you will find that the matter will proba-
bly adjust itself. If, on the contrary,
you are a woman, no amount of deport-
ment will make much difference.
SEEING, AND BEING SEEN OFF.
This is a transaction of great import-
ance and delicacy. The seer-off should
stand at a distance of about two feet
from the compartment in an attitude of
sorrowful expectation. On catching the
eye of those within, his face should
momentarily lighten, and he should
smile and nod briskly. This process
may be repeated any number of times
without fear of overdoing it. Care
should be taken to avoid consulting the
watch or staring impatiently at the
engine. As the train moves off, one
hand may be waved gracefully (if
possible) and a wistful expression con-
veyed to the countenance. After this it
is best to retire at once, in case the thing
should be only shunting.
Meanwhile the seen-off will gaze
pensively from the window and return
the nods with, if anything, a shade more
melancholy, befitting one who voyages
into an unknown and (as regards the
seer-off at least) friendless world. Con-
versation on both sides is generally
restricted to such observations as “Don’t
you wait!” “Soon be off now!” and
“Mind you write " " da capo and ad lib.;
but topics of a more intimate character
may be broached, and for these what is
called the Mysterious Method is recom-
mended. A few simple phrases, as, “I
hope she won't tell him about the other
day”; or, “You see we did manage it
after all!” will furnish your fellow-
travellers with a field for interesting
speculation that should cause their
journey to pass both quickly and
pleasantly.
EATING IN TRAINs.
Of this occupation the author truly
observes that it is a matter of elaborate
and almost Oriental ritual. Refresh-
ment-holders may be divided under two
heads, the luncheon-basket of the male,
and the reticule or hand-bag of the softer
sex. Of a luncheon-basket, as being the
visible token of a robust appetite, as
much display should be made as possible,
and to this end a list of viands and
beverages of suitably pungent fragrance
is provided.
The hand-bag, on the contrary, is in
its essence secretive. It is most fre-
quently used to contain sandwiches or
bath-buns, which should be broken
furtively, with the fingers inside the
bag, and conveyed to the lips in an
abstracted and as it were unconscious
manner, the attention meanwhile being

Of rapturous excess,
I drink not madness from those eyes
Whose beauty I confess;
I ask no passion in return,
Since I have none to give;
To die for thee I do not yearn—
For I prefer to live;
No blood for thy sake have I spilt –
I have no blood to spare, —
But, Lady, love me if thou wilt,
Or, if thou wilt, forbear.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
RICHARD BAGot's story of Love's Proxy (ARNOLD) is cleverly
conceived and told in the true comedy vein of well-balanced
humour and pathos. The author never
descends to farce, nor does he attempt
extravagantly-coloured descriptions. The
dialogues are perfectly natural. This is of
the very best in the art of novel-writing. A
more pleasant and evenly interesting book
it has not often fallen to the Baron's lot to
read. Though unsensational, its central
situation is sufficiently dramatic : while
the finish of the human comedy strikes
the true note of pathos. There are in it two mis-
takes not to be ignored by the laudator: the first is
the title, which, like the measles, is catching; but when
you have read the book it becomes somewhat mystifying.
Secondly, it is regrettable that, like HENRY ARTHUR Jones
when he was weary of his own latest comedy, Joseph En-
tangled, at the Haymarket, RICHARD BAGot should adopt so
old a device as an accidental eaves-dropping for the sake
of clearing up difficulties.
The last time my Baronite heard of John CoIFMAN, mention
was made of him in a letter from a friend, who wrote to say
that the veteran actor had broken down in health, and that
a subscription was on foot to ease his pathway through what
remained of the long journey of life. Soon after came news
of the end, and here, in two portly volumes, published by
HUTCHINson, is the record of Fifty Years of an Actor's Life.
The story goes back literally to the times of Mr. Crummles
and his famous company at Portsmouth. ColeMAN identifies
the original of DickeNs's fancy, and more than hints that the
unfledged novelist was a failure in the troupe. Running away
to join the stage while still a boy, CoLEMAN saw all its seamy
side. It was a different world in those days, the lessee and
manager being more of the Crummles type than that of
Sir HENRY Irving. A scratch company played in barns
dignified by high-sounding names. They got meagre pay
when times were moderately good, straightway spent it, and
starved whilst the ghost walked. What stands forth with
undesigned prominence is the kindness of the strolling
players to each other. None was so poor he could not spare
a coin and a crust for a brother in lower deeps. The eager
boy, anxious to play Hamlet, Romeo, Othello, and other small
things he believed he could do better than most men to
whom the parts were assigned, came in personal contact with
many old stagers. He played with MACREADY, of whom he
- writes much; approached PHELPs in vain
endeavour to obtain an engagement at Sad-
ler's Wells; trod the stage with CHARLEs
MATHEws and Madame VESTRIs, with BENJAMIN
WEBSTER and Madame CELESTE; knew G. V.
BrookE, HELEN FAUCit, BARRY SULLIVAN, ED-
--- win Forrest, Charlotte CUSHMAN, Charles
KEAN, and other stars in a theatrical firmament long since
darkened. ColeMAN had a long life, on the whole a merry
one, and generously shares its fun with his reader.
My Nautical Retainer has been greatly refreshed by the
reading of Incomparable Bellairs (CONSTABLE). It resumes
the intrigues of #. charming breaker of mendable hearts
who captivated the readers of The Bath Comedy some few
years ago. In their sequel, AGNEs and EGERTON CASTLE have
had the courage to introduce, in the character of Rachel
Peace, a serious element into that atmosphere of frivolity
which was the life-breath of Kitty Bellairs. The pathos of
her inevitable passion, if it does not actually verge on melo-
drama, is perhaps too strongly, too almost tragically, con-
trasted with the light volatile loves that flutter like moths in
asbestos armour about the scintillating Kitty. In the very
first chapter—perhaps the cleverest in the whole book—the
picture of the gracious innocence of the Quaker girl serves a
little to temper one's taste for the shallow distractions of the
society whose fringe it was her evil fate to touch. However,
it would take a good deal more than this to put out of coun-
tenance, the irrepressible Bellairs, even if the unsuspected
womanliness of her sympathy for Rachel had not redeemed
her from the charge of mere egoism. We leave the pretty
widow on the eve of an alliance with the best-hearted rogue in
either book: but she, and her admirers too for that matter,
have so often escaped the toils that we may yet hope for a
further tale of her wooing. There is perhaps no passage in
this second stage that is quite so diverting as the chapter
in The Bath Comedy where the virtue of the Bishop of BATH
AND WELLs is compromised; but, grave or gay, every page
glows with those eighteenth-century graces which the authors,
in common with the courtly poet to whom their work is
dedicated, have claimed for their peculiar heritage.
Olive Latham, by E. L. WoyNich (HEINEMANN), is a clever
book, and in some respects powerfully written. The devo-
tion of a self-sacrificing, deeply attached woman, with a mind
so unbalanced as to have but a hazy perception of the dis-
tinction between right and wrong, is scarcely a personality
to enlist the sympathies of an honest English reader on
behalf of the brutally treated Poles under the Russian mis-
government. Had the story, mutatis mutandis, been transferred
to Ireland of less than a hundred and fifty years ago, when it
would have been equally true of that “distressful country.”
under the cruel penal laws, it would have had a greater chance of
attracting sympathetic attention
than has this narrative of fiendish
persecution and hopeless suffer-
ing. But perhaps the talented au-
thoress is not so well acquainted
with the history of Ireland as she
is with that of Poland. The
character of Olive's father, who
begins with bright prospects
and great energy, and then goes
under, is sadly true in ordinary
life. The heroine is never a
very sweet Olive, and ends by
being a decidedly bitter one.

THE HOME OF LIBERTY.
THE King's Commission gravely sat
Probing the crust of hoary creeds;
They heard the notions, this and that,
Of such as knew their country's needs;
And they declared, by two to one,
That in defence of Home and Beauty
England expects each mother's son
Some day to do his martial duty.
I moved with meditative feet
Along the Strand's alluvial marge,
And there I saw a poster-sheet
Printed in letters green and large:
Broadly, the facts were thus expressed
(Though, for the words, I slightly twist 'em):-
Four Million workixG-MEN PROTEST
AGAINST THE CONTINENTAL SYSTEM.
I could believe it. I was swift
To find it racy of the soil;
I knew the British Workman's gift
For shunning any form of toil;
I knew he could not fail to shirk
Fatigue and guard and grim reveille,
For when he sees a job of work
He trembles like an aspic-jelly.
Pampered with breakfast-table fare
At prices fabulously short;
With gladiators, cheap as air,
Trained to provide vicarious º
Rather than waste, on work or play,
Time, talents, energy, expenses,
He goes the good old Roman way
That points to Panem et Circenses.
This is his birthright, being free.
Over his beer in liquid staves
He mocks the vile indignity
Of habits incident to slaves;
But most he views with scornful eyes
Those foreign churls, mere human chattels,
On whom the noxious duty lies
To fight at need the nation's battles.
Some Englishmen may choose to dare
Death of their free unfettered will ;
That is not his but their affair,
So long as others meet the bill;
Nor if, to save his private ears,
Our local trenches needed filling,
Would he object to Volunteers
Who pay for leave to learn their drilling;
But never a candidate shall get
The labour vote--let that be known—
Who asks that each in turn, should set
His country's claims above his own |
Let German dogs permit the State
To march and starch and sweat and bleed 'em,
But Heaven defend that such a fate
Should fall upon the Sons of Freedom'
Secure behind that wall of fame
Our fighting conscript-fathers won,
O Liberty, in thy dear name
How many things are left undone !
For who would mar his ease of mind
By patriot service, bound to bore him,
When he is always free to find
Some simple soul to do it for him?

THE TOMMIES” TOURNAMENT.
“WALK up, walk up,” or motor, or bike, or drive to the
Agricultural Hall, and see the Military Tournament to-day or
to-morrow, June 9, when the show comes to an end. Do not
forget to notice the inscription that, glorified by flags high u
aloft at each extremity of the building, announces to the crowd,
not the naval and military glories of the British Empire, not
the loyal watch-cry of “God Save the King!” but the name,
style and title of those whose timely provisions can effect so
much both in peace and war, that is, of the Refreshing
Firm that has contracted for this expansive advertise-
ment! Long live the Roast Beef of Old England, coupled
with drinks of all sorts, without which even these stalwart
heroes of the Military Tournament would faint and bite the
sawdust. Caterer, thou reasonest well!
The band of the First Life Guards, under Mr. FRED HAINEs,
L.R.A.M., has had its work cut out. Here is blow for blow,
given up in the orchestra, where all are “a blowing,” and
never “a growing” weary. Every “display” in the after-
noon show, that lasts for nearly four hours, was (on the
occasion of this visit) brought off with marvellous punc-
tuality, each performance iºn. within at least twenty
minutes after the time announced in the programme. It
was wonderfully kept going! “One down tother come
on' " is the rule for this programme, so strictly adhered to,
even in individual cases, that when an unfortunate warrior of
the artillery comes to grief, another plucky one is ready to
spring into his saddle and be his substitute. How delightful,
how inspiring, it must be in war to go to battle with a
splendid orchestra perched up aloft playing appropriately
inspiring airs! Scarcely a manoeuvre but ends with some
artistically designed and spiritedly executed tableau, which,
on a field of battle, must be one of the most heart-stirring
sights. Imagine how an enemy in ambush would be fasci-
nated by witnessing a musical ride executed by our hea
cavalry to the tune (among others) of “Mr. Dooley-ooley-oo!”
The enemy is bound to give in at once: to come out of their
ambush, applaud enthusiastically, insist on fraternising, and
then to hilariously join the mazy dance. Bravo! Vive la
damse ( Vive la guerre / Vivent les deua, ensemble!
Best of all, where everything is best, is the gymnastic
display of the lively and intelligent boys of the Duke of |
York's Royal Military School. How many forms there are in .
this jº. would be difficult to say, but every form present
is to be noted as first-class. So also for the Royal Marine
Artillery, whose men unlimbered a gun in less than no time,
and, having fired it off point blank at the little red-riding-
hooded girls of the Duke of York's School (without hurting
one of them, thank goodness!) packed up and bolted away
ere you, or anyone else, could even so much as think of calling
out “Police!” or of invoking the mysterious “JAck Robinson.”
The Historical Pageant will amuse all, from the entrance of
the English troops mustered at Crecy, marching in to the tune
of “If I had a donkey what wouldn't go,” up to the exit of
our most modern warriors in khaki, to the inspiring strains of
“Rule, Britannia,” “God Save the King,” and finally the
“March from Tannhäuser.” The Circusy masquerading part
of the military display, the present deponent is inclined to
regard as mere Tommy-foolery. This view is, perhaps,
hypercritical. Taking such haphazard notes of the music
as was possible in the midst of so much excitement,
your very unmilitary, but ever civil, reporter, was struck
by the frequent recurrence of the late HENRY RUSSELL's
popular compositions, such as “Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” “A Life
on the Ocean Wave,” and so forth. These be our national
melodies, popular and inspiriting.

to “dress up" as Indians), tent-pegging, and whooping for

throats, just as if it were brown rappee

After this there was dummy-hunting,
representing the clowning part of the
entertainment; and then came the now
highly popular “Push-ball” played by
teams of Horse Guards. The horses
thoroughly enjoyed this, as it was evi-
dently the first time in their experience
when to have anything to do with a ball
was entirely distinct from a “twitch”
in the nostril followed by unpleasant
medicinal consequences. Men and horses
“kept the ball a-rolling” for a good
twenty minutes; but which side came
off victorious this deponent did not stop
to ascertain. Trusting that the best men
and horses would win, he departed
hurriedly, and after dodging the wheels
of the Royal Artillery gun-carriages,
escaping unscathed from the ’oofs of
the 'osses, and successfully performing
various other strategic movements, he,
having formulated his plan of campaign,
which included the escalading an omni-

conveyance, having “come out at the

the protectorate of the guardian Angel

OUR MR. JABBERJEE IN THE FAR EAST.
Wiii.
In Korea once more.
(By Extra Special Runner.)
I HAVE been very kindly given my congé by Col. KHAKIMONo,
with indefinite leave to absent myself, and I can only devotedly
hope that the Japanese army may not commit any too
shatterpated actions, now that they are temporarily deprived
of my counsellings!
But I am under serious apprehensions lest they may be so
overjoyed with their bird-in-hand as to underrate some
rather formidable covey of Russian eagles concealed in an
ambush. I have private information that Hon’ble KUROPATKIN
is already hastening up with several hundred ikons. Also
that Port Arthur is now so completely insulated that it is
more impregnable than ever, having sealed up its harbour so
hermetically that no Japanese junk can obtain admittance.
A certain Russian prisoner of war, Hon'ble Major DROSCHKY-
viTCH, who is accompanying me on his patrole, assures me
that before eighteen months his country is indubitably to
assume highly offensive attitudes, by invading Japanese
territories. As their own squadrons are lying snug in Port
Arthur, they will be compelled for such invasion to make use
of the Japanese fleet, which is by no means so well adapted
for the purpose. However, it is only a sail for a very few
hours, and §. D. is confident that, when his countrymen
are once landed, they will completely overturn the tables.
I am free to confess that my gore is chilled by these
methodistical calculations, and if only I had not most
unfortunately mislaid my wireless pole I would at once
telegraph Hon’ble General KUROKI that he will do well to
look at home before he leaps too far into the Manchurian
darkness.
After taking so leading a part in the Battle of Kiu-lien-
Cheng (described in a previous report, which has, I trust,
come to hand), I am naturally rather tired of war's alarms,
and am now mainly pre-occupied with health of my poor
unfortunate crock, which, alas! is still very so-so
Being of abnormally high-strung temperament, his bellicose
adventures have reduced him to a condition of uncontrollable
i". For º only a day or two since, when
a Korean juvenile , in a spirit of barbarous puerility,
discharged a pea at Sho-ji's nose from a popshooter, my said
pony was so violently upset that he incontinently rolled
over with all his quatre fers en l'air, and fainted away for
ten minutes on his end
Notwithstanding which debility the Korean horse-physician
here says that, although my pony's nervous system is rather
. dismantled, he expects, with care and quietude,
that he is ultimately to recover his mental balance. Only I
am cautioned not to employ him, at present, as a battle-horse.
So, being thus disbarred from proceeding to the front till
further notice, I am forced to fly at smaller games, and have
already gone in for bear-fighting—which (as I think I men-
tioned in previous letter) is a far more exhilarating recreation
than a mere tiger-hunt, as Korean grizzlies are of notoriously
ferocious idiosyncrasies.
I made the proposition to the aforesaid Major DROSCHKyviTCH
that we º take a day off in company, and see whether
we could not succeed in captivating at least one bear between
us.
“I will come with the whole of my heart, little Father
JABBERJEEVITCH!” he responded, “on condition that you, as
the old Shikari in such sporting expeditions, assume supreme
command.”
To which I assented, being reluctant to admit that, while
in India, I had become totally out of practice in the art of
bear-sticking.
But a certain Korean Geomancer, who had been a some-
what arduous sportsman before adopting the more sedentary
profession of divination, reported, after constructing my
horoscope and making a few incantations, that the day after
the next would be my lucky day, whereon I should be utterly
impervious to any ferae maturae — which decided me to
appoint that as the date for our shoot.
The aforesaid Geomancer further lent me his own favourite
fouling-piece, which, so he asserted, possessed the magic
qualification of never missing when it was correctly aimed.
Thus armed, I repaired myself, with Major D. when the
auspicious day was thoroughly broken, to the locality which
the natives assured us was the customary haunt of one of
their finest bears.
After posting my Russian friend in the direction from
which the animal was inevitably to emerge, I modestly took
up my position at a considerable distance, behind a large
bush.
The merest tyro in ursine peculiarities is aware that every
bear is furnished by Nature with such saccharine teeth that
he cannot resist making a hog of himself with a pot of honey.
Accordingly I had taken the precaution to purchase, at a
Korean general store, a bulky jar of Japanese home-manu-
factured honey, which was labelled in colourable imitation
of London jam-merchants.
This I deposited in front of the bush as a decoy duck, and
waited for the prey to turn up.
But for several hours no bear put in an appearance, and I
was becoming all agog with impatience, when my shoulder
was unceremoniously clapped from behind—and, on turning
my head, I beheld a Bruin of Brobdingnagian dimensions,
who was evidently inquisitive regarding the nature of my
occupation
Swift as a doe, I discharged my fouling-piece at a blank
point—but, either the weapon had been insufficiently en-
chanted, or I was too flabbergasted to aim correctly at such
short notice—for, so far from prostrating the bear, it was
myself whose heels were sent flying over my head
On returning to percipience, I made the shocking dis-
covery that I was being dragged along into more open
country! Naturally, my first impulse was to rise to my feet,
and grapple my assailant to my soul with hooks of steel.
But a momentary reflection convinced me that Mister Bruin
was probably to prove himself the more proficient wrestler,
whether in Graeco-Roman, Catch-who-catch-can, or Ju-Jit-su
styles, and that perhaps my wisest policy was to counterfeit
the demeanour of a post-mortem.
Of this I succeeded in giving so lifelike an imitation that,
to my unspeakable dismay, the Grizzly at once proceeded to
scratch a large hole for my interment—after which he covered
me with leaves, as if taking such leaves from the book of the
robins in the well-known English ballad of the Babes in
Wood, which twittered: “‘Who'll dig his grave?’ ‘I,’ said
the Robin, all sighing and sobbing, “I’ll dig his grave!’”
Only, unluckily, the Bear was by no means melted to
lachrymation point, and, from the resigned attitude with
which he sat on my head, I easily divined that he had only
afforded myself Christian burial until he should become
oppressed by pangs of appetite'
As luck would have it, he had selected a spot for my
temporary tomb in close proximity to the above-mentioned
honey-jar, which, with enormous presence of mind, I surrep-
titiously contrived to kick off in his direction. No sooner had
he snuffed preserves than he embraced the pot amorously
between his front paws, and immediately transferred its
contents to the recesses of his own interior.
Now, although a frenzied admirer of Japanese enterprise,
I am compelled to confess that their native sweetstuffs,
although got up externally with very able imitations of
genuine British tradesmarks, are, as a rule, composed of
highly adulterated materialism.

Spinner (our demon left-hander). “You couldn't 'Ave DoNE Nothing with IT, SIR.”
And I shrewdly suspect that this particular honey must bruin, this is not the half of a bad hide, and its cost price
have been manufactured by a very incompetent (and possibly
altogether bogus) class of bee!
For, within an incalculably brief period after licking the
pot clean, this unfortunate Bruin was seized with severe
sickishness, together with such intolerable pains in stomach
department that he was soon rolling and roaring like toad
under harrow !
So, perceiving that he was far too engrossed with his
internal symptoms to pay further attention to myself, I
crawled out, and, as soon as he became a comatose, dealt him
such swashing blows on top of head with the butt-end of my
fouling-piece that he was compelled to shuffle out of his
mortal coils and pay the debt of Nature!
Thereupon, with the aid of my pocket-knife, I deprived
him of his integument, which, as per my original promise,
I am forwarding as my humble contribution to the furnitures
of Punch's palatial office. [ED. CoM.—A parcel did actually
arrive, invoiced from Calcutta and containing a large roll
of what looked like black lamb's wool, which it was found
necessary to have destroyed at once.]
I must offer best apologies for fact that said bearskin is
slightly moth-eaten. [ED. CoM.–Slightly!!] You must
remember that I have already mentioned that this district
teems with excessively large lepidopteras, and it is impossible
to come across any bear which has not been more or less
damaged by such parasitical depredations. For a Korean
out here would be, at least, yen 100. But I have the typical
Indian characteristic to hang the expense, when making
presents—especially to so openhanded a friend as your
esteemed self! - H. B. J.

Bellelettrist and Botanist, to an Elgin Correspondent in
reply to various queries:
. . . . IN reply to your courteous inquiries I have to say,
(a), that I cannot claim the credit for having invented the
word “anecdotage”; (b), the number of volumes of selections
from my diary has not yet reached three figures; (c), my
favourite quotation is pereant qui nostra ante nos dizerunt;
(d), the best instance of an imprompturiddle that occurs to me
was one that I made in conversation with Lord ODo Russell
at the Cosmopolitan Club. We were talking about miracles
and I suddenly said to him, “What is the difference between
a miracle and Queen ElizaBETH 2." Lord ODo professed his
inability to solve the conundrum, so I obliged him with the
answer: “One is a wonder and the other is a Tudor (two-der).”
Lord Odo afterwards repeated this to Prince Bismarck, who

MURRAY (Dr.), Lexicographer, to Mr. Robert MAXWELL, ex-

. . . . Being anxious to render my Dictionary complete in
the terminology of pastime, I have been recommended to
apply to you for enlightenment in reference to certain words
with which my unassisted intelligence is unable adequately
to cope. (1) Tonk. I see it stated in the report of a recent
match that Mr. Edward BLACKWELL “hit a tremendous tonk
off the fifteenth tee.” My friend Professor W. W. SKEAT is
of opinion that the word is purely onomatopoeic. For my
own part I am inclined to connect the word by GRIMM's law
with the mystic vocable köyö, unless indeed it may be derived
from a surname. There is, I know, a well-known artist of
the name of Tonks. Perhaps there may also be a golfer of
the same name, distinguished for the vigour of his stroke.
(2) Can you kindly supply me with definitions differentiating|..
the exact meaning of foozle, fluff, and flub? (3) Is the
phrase plusser, i.e. a plus man, generally accepted? . . . .

Howorth (Sir HENRY H.), “Times” Correspondent and

SIR,-Iregret that I am unable to give you the information
you are in search of. Your application is evidently based |
on a misunderstanding, my magnum opus being the history
not of the Mongrels but the Mongols. If, as I am inclined
to suppose, there is any analogy between the brute creation
and mankind, Ishould think you would be most likely to obtain
all the necessary details from one or other of those pestiferous
hybrids, the Free Fooders, whose recent incursion into the
arena of politics has poisoned the springs of Parliamentary
life, corrupted the national fibre, and threatens to envelope
the entire Empire in a miasmatic atmosphere of mediaeval

“Boudin,” I said to my friend the other day, “I feel I am

to together, I haven't taken you to see any of our national
sports, such as horse-racing, or cricket, or—”
“Or the game of golf,” put in Boudin. “Oh, my friend,
do not omit him, for it is a great game, the game of golf.”
“Well,” said I, “it’s not a bad game, though it is, perhaps,
more Scotch than English. Still, we English have made it
Our Own.
“Ah, you noble English,” he cried enthusiastically, “how
I see you from far. . It is always like that with you. You
See a poor game which is a Scotch game and you say, ‘These
poor Scotch,' you say, ‘cannot understand how a game must
be played. Let us,' you say, “annex this game and make it
an English game, so that it may be great and prosperous
and everything that is truly English, and then, sapristi, you
take it and you make of it a bit of your rule Britannia. Is
it not so?”
“Perhaps,” said I, smiling, “we do rather manage to
improve any game we take up, but then we've been at games
for a deuce of a long time, and, of course, we've got more
experience of how things should be done than ->
“Oh, do not incommode yourself for me,” he said; “say
what you were going to say as if Boudin was not in the room.
These Frenchmen, you were going to say, do not understand
games and they make me pity. They do not play the
cricket; they do not play the golf; how shall they be able
to remporter any success in the public life, in the beautiful
arts, or in making war? They have their absinthe, and they
all drink it, from M. LouBET, who has been in England and
ought to know better, down to the quite small infants who
have just arrived to balance themselves on their legs. They
are a nation of drinkers of absinthe, who cannot understand
the cricket or the golf, and well, if it were not for the
entente cordiale, which assure, to them the friendship of
England, they would burst like dogs, those unfortunate
miserable Frenchmen. My faith, I go to naturalise myself

immediately, and when le Lor Maire have receive me in the
City, I will learn the cricket and the golf, without which it
is not possible to be an Englishman or a good man at all.”
“My dear Boudin,” I said, “you mustn't excite yourself so
much.”
“Ah, you have reason; I inflame myself too much. I am
like the old gentleman I have seen playing the golf, for I
have seen your golf, yes, I have seen it, and I am still alive.
I did not die of excitement. ‘Boudin,' I say me, ‘you must
survive, my fine fellow. It is true,' I say, “that to see these
magnificent Englishmen promenading themselves so seriously
and following the little ball—it is true that the spectacle is
grandiose, and it makes me much emotion, but courage, my
friend, and surtout, try to be calm,’ and, as I say this to
myself, sudden I see an old gentleman in knickerbockers
and a red coat and a casquette of cloth, as if he had made it
from what he did not use for his knickerbockers, and a red
face, but of a red more red even than his coat, and the old
gentleman, who have white hairs, he look at the little ball,
and he take a long stick ->
“Club,” I said hastily; “you mustn't call it stick.”
“Oh, well, all that is equal to me—he take a long clob
and he commences, but very slowly, to écarter ses jambes,
and he make the clob to go backward and forward over the
ball comme un papillon, and at last he say to himself, “Aha,
rascal of a ball, now I will immolate you,' and, pif-paf, il
tire son coup, but he do it in the air, and the little rascal of
a ball stay there and, as for me, I puff with laughter.”
“What did the old gentleman do?” I asked.
“Well, he did not say ‘rosbif or “bifteck,” or ‘I sell my
wife at Smithfield,' but he say something which is quite as
English, and a little word, and he say it to his clob and to
the ball and to his eyes, and after he try again and he hit
the ground and he break his clob, and I murmur to myself,
‘Tu l'as woulu, Georges Dandin,' and the old gentleman—
perhaps he do not understand French—he hear me say
†in: and he makes me the eyes of a tiger, and at last
he put his hands in his pockets, and there he is departed
without his clobs or anything. I informed myself who he
was, and they tell me he is a member of Parliament. My
faith, I make you my compliments of him, for he knows how
to speak, that one.”
“Anyhow,” said I, “it’s a capital thing for men like that
to have a little fresh air and to play a game of some sort.”
“Oh, as to that, I do not say no; for you have told me
that it is games which make Englishmen what they are, and
it is golf certainly which have made this member of Parlia-
ment an old gentleman with a red face to whom the mustard
mounts to his nose when he hit the air with a clob.”
“JONES THE MAN.”
IN a review of a book entitled Theodore Roosevelt, we read
that “one day the President and his biographer travelled
in a crowded car. A factory girl got in, and Roosevelt the
Man rose and gave her his seat.” Roosevelt the President
probably fined the Car Company for over-crowding. The
distinction is a subtle one, and might be carried out further,
as follows:
“Mr. Josiah SPIFKINS, the well-known Editor, was out dining
the other night. After ‘one crowded hour of glorious life,’
Spifkins the Man, who had partaken somewhat freely of the
numerous courses set before him, was handed a cup of
coffee by the footman. Spifkins the Editor was compelled to
return it owing to unusual pressure on space.”
“We understand that Hall Caine the Man, in a recent
speech, expressed his undisguised admiration for Hall Caine
the Novelist.”

MR. PUNCH wishes to take his share in attracting public
attention to a matinée fixed for June 23, got up by the
generous theatrical profession to assist the well-known
dramatic critic, Mr. CLEMENT Scott, so long and honourably
connected with the Daily Telegraph, in a time of trial, of
much suffering, and of physical incapacity for the special
work in which he has excelled, and to which his journalistic
career has been devoted.
To assist in this good work, comes, ever first and foremost
in the cause of charity, Sir HENRY IRVING, giving on this
occasion his inimitable impersonation of Corporal Brewster
in CoNAN Doyle's Story of Waterloo.
Mr. BEERBOHM TREE is to appear as Diogenes, the original
founder of the Tubingen Philosophical School, in which
character he will recite the soliloquy adapted to his sur-
roundings, commencing, “Tubby or not Tubby, that is the
question.”
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, who, as ALEXANDER, naturally
enough, is in close proximity to Diogenes, will give the
touching speech, “If I were not ALEXANDER at the St. James's,
I would be Diogenes at His Majesty's ' " and, unless these
lines are enthusiastically encored over and over again, he will
then gracefully bow and exit.
Mr. ARTHUR BourchIFR is announced for a “new comic
one-act piece, by Mr. WATson.” Whether this is to present
Mr. BouncBIFR as Sherlock Holmes, with constant question,
“Do you follow me, WATson?” we are not in a position to
state. This show is entitled The Conversion of Nat Sturge.
Sub-title, The Stinging Nat Stung.
Les deux Grossmiths, GEORGE and WEEDON, will appear in
a “ duologue written by themselves!” Fancy that ' all by
themselves!! no one near when they did it! But crowds, of
course, to see and hear them perform it. It ought to be a
success, by GEORGE |–and WEEDON.
The actresses kindly gracing the performance will be
JULIANEilson, MARIE TEMPEST (quite calm after her sea trip),
EDNA MAY, ADA REEVE, IRENE WANBRUGR, and other “dear
charmers” not as yet mentioned in the bill of Fair Women.
Then Mr. SEYMoUR Hicks is to appear, “supported by a
chorus of Fourteen Ladies.” Fortunate Mr. Hicks! what
matter if he faint, stagger and only shake his head helplessly,
as long as he be supported by this bevy of Fourteen Beauties!
This tableau of Mr. Hicks and the Fair Fourteen might
serve as an illustration of Mr. BERNARD SHAw's play, Arms
and the Man. Beautiful arms! Lucky man
Many more attractions are to be added to the above, at
least so we gather from the programme; and to one and all
doing their very best on behalf of our old friend CLEMENT
Scott Mr. Punch heartily wishes a colossal success. Here is
the unique occasion when the critic's weakness is the actors'
opportunity!
MR. PUNCH has pleasure in directing the attention of sports-
men of his own limited stature to an advertisement in the Field
announcing the sale of an estate, “including fifty acres of sport-
ing woods, together with a small gentleman's residence.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Tuesday, May 31.
—John O'Gorst, time-honoured educa-
tionalist, almost in solitude on Front
..] Bench below Gangway, Ministerial side,
looked up with sudden start. For
a moment he sat with lips parted,
eyes staring straight before him, hands
clutching edge of bench. Had he seen
that wraith, the Committee of Council
of Board of Education of which we heard
so much when County GUY and he
looked after the department? No living
person ever beheld it in the flesh. Some
there were who regarded it as the Mrs.
HARRIs of administrative bodies. They
“didn't believe there was no sich
person.”
As one followed the strained glance ex-
planation leaped to light. At the corner
of Front Bench below Gangway opposite
was WINSTON CHURCHILL, in the very seat
where, twenty-four years ago, GRANDOLPH
nursed a dainty foot crossed over one
knee, and tugged at a moustache of
which, next to the companionship of
DRUMMOND Wolff and GoRST, he was
chiefly proud. So like the father too—
less in face than in figure, in gesture and
manner of speech. When the young
Member for OLDHAM addresses House,
with hands on hips, head bent forward,
right foot stretched forth, memories of
days that are no more flood the brain.
Like father is son in his habit of in-
dependent view of current topics, the
unexpectedness of his conclusions, the

ruthlessness of his personalities, his dis-
regard for authority, his contempt of the
conventions, his perfect phrasing of dis-
agreeable remarks. His special enmity to
DoN José and all his works is hereditary.
He does not forget, and cannot forgive,
the rebuff that seared his father's proud
heart when Birmingham clamoured for
him to represent them in the House of
Commons, and DON José peremptorily
said “No.”
Doubtless, in the task which now
engages leisure hours snatched from
conflict with DON José on his new
fiscal campaign, he comes upon evidence
in the writing of a vanished hand which
shows how deeply that cut was felt.
The MEMBER FOR SARK, close in
GRANDOLPH's confidence at the time,
knows how the thrust went home.
WINSTON is a convinced Free Trader.
But he enters with lighter, more fully
gladdened, heart on the conflict, since
Protection is championed by his father's
ancient adversary.
House resumed to-day after Whitsun
holidays. Attendance small; benches
mostly empty. WINSTON, entering with
all the world before him where to
choose, strides down to his father's old
3. on the Front Bench below
Hangway to left of SPEAKER, and sits
among the ghosts of the old Fourth
Party.
“He’s gone over at last, and good
riddance,” say honest hacks munching
their corn in well-padded stalls of the
Government stables. They don't like
young horses that kick out afore and
ahint, and cannot safely be counted
upon to run in double harness.
“WINSTON's gone over at last,” they re-
peat, whinneying with decorous delight.
Not a bit of it. He merely claims
right as independent Member to sit
where he pleases. On one side to-day,
t'other to-morrow; some day, if he lives,
on the Treasury Bench.
Meanwhile, he celebrates his first
day's lodging in the Opposition camp
by going into the Division Lobby in
support of Government. That proves
his inherent consistency, displayed in
diverse circumstances. When he sat
with the Ministerialists he often voted
with the Opposition.
Business done.—Back after holidays;

nary gallop, jockeyed by Earl PERCY.
| Except in respect of assembly of

the Bill did better than the horse. The
very emptiness of the Chamber, the
| languor of the few speakers, combined
to form highest tribute to success of
LANSDowne's diplomacy. Attempt of

there; 'tis the business of the Opposi-
tion to oppose. But nothing could
| obscure importance of the accomplished
. removing ancient quarrels that
might at some critical time have blazed
|forth at the cannon's mouth.
Later came news of Gouvernant's
discomfiture.

and provided for it in a phrase. You

from his dream on the eve of Bosworth
and crying,

his woeful story. “One night, remain-
ing here in obedience to the call of
public duty, I dined chiefly and, I may
add, not expensively, off lamb. I admit
it was very good. But on paying my
bill, Mr. Lowth ER, I learned that it was
not English lamb but New Zealand;
in short, it was Canterbury.”
Members on both sides joined in low
blood-curdling groan of sympathy.
“Sir,” continued Mr. Pickwick, one
hand in familiar fashion thrust under
his coat tail, the other swinging his eye-
glasses, “I resolved never to eat it
again.”
This, as opening up fresh depth of
horror, drew forth more moans from the
anguished audience. To eat Canterbury
lamb at a 2s. ordinary under the impres-
sion that it was the innocent offspring
of a sojourner on the South Downs was
bad enough. To contemplate the pros-
pect of eating the slice again in whatever
condensed form was an added horror.

MR. PUNCH'S SYMPOSIA.
XVI.-ON STYLE.
SCENE–The Authors' Club.
PRESENT:
Mr. Robert Abel (Surrey and Daily
Mail).
Bishop Welldon (Westminster and
M.C.C.).
C. B. Fry (Sussex and Daily

D. L. A. Jephson (Surrey and

Mr. John Tunnicliffe (Yorkshire and

Mr. Harold Begbie (Exeter Hall and
Press generally).
Mr. Robert Abel. It has been thought
that a comparison of notes as to the
models which have most helped us in
shaping our new literary career might
not be without interest and profit. That
is why we are met this evening.
Bishop Welldon. Speaking as the
Honorary Chaplain of the M.C.C. Aus-
tralian team, I may describe it as a very
laudable proceeding. Perhaps the
courtly Chairman will be so gracious as to
inform us as to who his own model was.
Abel. For some years I must admit I
was under the spell of CRAIG.
Bishop Welldon. CRAIG 2 I seem not
to be familiar with the name.
Abel. Yes, CRAIG, the Oval poet.
Bishop Welldon. You mystify me still
more. I have heard of square meals
and round robins, of circular tours and
oblong garters, but never of an Oval poet.
Mr. D. L. A. Jephson. ABEL means the
cricket ground, that scene of heroic but
bloodless encounters, of Homeric but—-
Bishop Welldom. Ah, yes. Ah, yes–
I understand now.
Abel. But latterly, as a “Guv'nor,” I
must confess I have been more attracted
by Pater.
Mr. Harold Begbie. How very interest-
ing! Do you know I guessed that. I
should so like to serve you up hot in
one of my Interviews as an esoteric
Paterian.
Mr. Jephson. That's a good phrase.
I must make a note of that for the
Chronicle. My style is a mixture of
SALA and JEROME-very good models too.
Fancy is what I aim at-fancy tempered
by fun and feeling.
Mr. S. M. J. Woods. I go in for facts.
Straightforward sinewy prose is my line.
Bishop Welldon. Ah, you like FIELDING”
Mr. Woods. Like fielding? Me? Not
much ; I hate it. What a rum idea!
Bishop Welldon. Oh! I meant the
author, the man. Surely you know Tom
Jones?

Mr. Woods. Not ToM, I think; SIDNEY
JoxEs, the Australian, I know, of course.
Bishop Welldon. Joseph Andrews then?
Mr. Woods. There used to be an
ANDREws who played for Sussex, a left-
hander. But his initials were W. H.
Abel. To return for a moment to our
literary masters, I wonder where Prince
RANJITsINHJi gets the exquisite finish of
his style.
Mr. C. B. Fry. From careful study of
the judicious HookER.
Mr. G. W. Beldam. I think I should
name KEATs as my master.
Bishop Welldon. Ah, that is because
he has a poem about you.
Mr. Beldam. About me?
Bishop Weldon. Certainly.
you are sans merci.
Abel. And a very taking little piece
it is too. I recited it once at a
Bermondsey smoker.
Mr. Harold Begbie. Oh, Mr. ABEL, you
must let me write about you as a Study
in Personality. I cannot resist a mystic.
Bishop Welldon. But is our friend a
mystic?
Mr. Harold Begbie. Whether he is or
not I'll make him one. I commune
with the stars.
Abel. What price the Evening News?
Tunnicliffe. What is a mystic? It
sounds rather like a loose ball.
Mr. Harold Begbie. I will make you
one too, if you will give me an interview.
There's nothing I can't do in that way.
I made HACKENSCHMIDT one, and Sir
WILLIAM HARcotRt.
Mr. C. B. Fry. You did your best to
make me one in the Westminster. A
scholar too. You said I was never
without a pocket Virgil, which I read
even when riding to hounds.
Mr. Woods. Yes, I read that. And
you said that he has a Meredithian
mood, and is filled with the rich wine
of life.
Tunnicliffe. Is that a good brand?
Mr. Harold Begbie. Well, one must
say something.
He says
Tunnicliffe. I learnt my style by
translating MAUPAssant. There is no
better preparation. [Ereunt.

tically even more than musically, should
fit her down to the ground. Of course,
on the Derby Festival night, when every
one talks racing shop, and all, tempo-
rarily, are more or less horsey, it would
have been quite sportsmanlike, and
eminently pardonable, had the prima
donna, the "favourite" of the evening,
been herself not quite herself, but a
little hoarse. So, as La Tosca couldn't
be played and sung, Faust was substi-
tuted, with the sweet SEE-USAN ADAMs as
that demure Daisy, Marguerite, attended
by Mlle. BAUERMEISTER the artistically
artful Duenna ; with M. RENAUD, not
quite so good as usual, as Valentine ;
and with M. DALMOREs, whose rendering
of rejuvenesced Faust was, musically,
most enjoyable. The special delight
of the entertainment was the re-appear-
ance of M. PLANçoN in such devilish good
form as Mephistopheles that in this
character, as in those of Friar Laurence
and Jupiter, he can only be labelled as
" The Inimitable.'' Trained bands and

414 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 8, 1904.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
Recently published by METHUEN, as one of that firm's series
of “The Antiquary's Library,” the latest work by Abbot
GasquET (with D.D., &c., &c., and several other alphabetical
distinctions attached to his name as becomes
a man of letters), entitled English Monastic
Life, with its numerous and well-reproduced
plans and illustrations, will be found by all
students of our island's history a work curi-
ously interesting and highly instructive. ...If
er uno disce omnes may be accepted as applic-
able to the samples selected by Dr. GASQUET,
in which he sets before the reader, as he says, “in as plain and
popular a manner as I could, the general tenor of the life
lived by the inmates in any one of these monastic establish-
ments,” then the Baron must conclude that, but for the
licensed freebooting of Bluffing King HAL and his talented
assistants, we at this time should have been all the better off
by the absence of poor rates and of other levies made on our
purses for the payment of Bumbledom and modern parochial
machinery. These heavy charges were defrayed, in ancient
days, by the monastic bodies who were stewards of the rich
and almoners for the poor. Among various survivals of old
monastic customs there is one at Eton College, where before
eleven o'clock school the masters assemble “in chambers”
to consult as to any special matter of immediate importance.
This is evidently a remainder over from the days when
“the chief officials responsible for the order of the house
repaired for a few minutes to the private parlour to consult
as to any matter which might need correction, or to which
public attention might be called.” The Baron would suggest
that, instead of the translation as given of
“Si sapiens fore vis, sex serva quae tibi mando–
Quid dicas, et ubi, de quo, cui, quomodo, quando,”
should be substituted:
“Would you be wise? of six things have a care—
Your words, of whom, to whom, how, when, and where,"
which couplet is humbly presented to the Abbatial author
with best wishes for present and future work.
What Major ARTHUR GRIFFITHs doesn't know about secret
Anarchistical Societies cannot be of any value. How the
gallant Major dares to show himself undisguised in public,
nay, how he can live in the same abode for more than
twenty-four hours at a time, is to the Baron, who trembles
for this gifted writer's safety, even a greater mystery than
all the mysteries of which the Major is past-master. From
these prefatorial remarks it may be gathered that this
author's latest novel, entitled A Woman of Business
(John LoNG), herewith recommended by the Baron to that,
majority of the reading public which votes solid for the
Major, describes the doings of certain satanic desperadoes
whose objects are the upheaval of law and order, and
the destruction of all property on which they themselves
cannot seize. “Ni Dieu mi maitre''' and “Que le diable
emporte le dernier!” The characters in this story are
clearly drawn; they are true to mere human nature at its
pluckiest, though not at its moral best, as also at its most
cowardly and fiendish worst.
Phoebe in Fetters (John MURRAY) is de-
cidedly one of the best novels of the year.
It is based on excellent purpose carried out
step by step with remarkable skill. Donald
Gilmour, a solicitor approaching middle
age, has “a past.” It, however, covers
nothing worse than a disappointment in
love. He offered his heart to a woman, and, as no well-filled
purse went with it, it was declined. A hard-headed, level-
minded, reserved, somewhat obstinate man, he concluded
that he had done with love and matrimony. Some years
after he meets a girl in black, “with luminous eyes that
sparkle with light in the pale vivid face.” This is Phoebe
Carburton, with whose father Gilmour had been at Oxford.
He had not prospered after the fashion of his younger mate,
and his daughter earned her living as a type-writer. In due
time Gilmour proposes to make the girl his wife. She
accepts him on the understanding that, as she put it in
imparting news of the engagement to her mother, “he
doesn't want to go in for hugging and kissing and so on.”
Even before the marriage-day Gilmour discovers he has mis-
calculated his own situation. He is desperately in love with his
bride, and when at the start of their honeymoon he attempts
to kiss her she turns and rends him. “If I had known it,
I would rather have died than marry you,” she gasped. “I
trusted what you said. I believed you meant just to take
care of me. I can never love you; but I shall hate you if
you—” A pretty dish this to set before a bridegroom.
My Baronite will not spoil sport by even hinting how it
turns out. Suffice it to say the story is told with a skill, a
variety of incident, and a power of delineating character, that
hold the reader breathless to the end. My Baronite has not
before come across the work of Mrs. BAILLIE REYNOLDs. Like
a character in fiction who shall be nameless, he “asks for
more.”
The King of Diamonds, by Louis TRACY (F. W. WHITE
& Co.), is well worth reading. The idea is daringly original
in conception, and the plot is worked out with such reckless
magnificence as can only find its parallel in Monte Cristo. But
whereas the hero of DUMAs' great romance lived for revenge,
and triumphantly ticked off his enemies as they perished
one by one, Mr. TRACY's hero shows such an example of
magnanimity, and exhibits a spirit of charity so excep-
tionally Christian, that, for the sake of sensational romance,
it is to be devoutly hoped, no other hero will think him-
self called upon to imitate him. If villains of the deepest dye
in an Adelphi drama, who have committed every crime
possible from petty theft up to murder, are henceforth to be
allowed to get off scot free on giving their solemn promise
“not to do it again,” then what
price justice, and what’s to be-
come of “Hawkshaw the detec-
tive” and of that highly accom-
plished amateurin the Intelligence
Department, Sherlock Holmes 2
This new idea of “pardon all Fº
round” is admirably managed in tº
The King of Diamonds, where 3º
the hero forgives every knave Wº
in the pack, much to the ad-
miration, but, it must be added,
to the honest indignation of the
judicially discriminating Baron.
RULE, BRITANNIA!
SIR,--Someone writing in favour of the suddenly re-proposed
Channel Tunnel scheme says, “As regards the physical diffi-
culties to be encountered, they are certainly inferior to those
now being presented to the engineers of the Simplon Tunnel.”
Bother the Simplon Tunnel ! The point that strikes me, and
many other fellow sea-sufferers, is-what are these “physical
difficulties” compared with those that I (and others made like
me) have to suffer in crossing the Channel ! If everyone
could feel as I do—0 si sic omnes—then engineers, French
and English, would hurry up with the Chunnel Tannel !
That's my opinion Tell that to the Submarines with the
compliments of Yours truly, C. GREEN.

right when he gave Bohemia a sea-coast.]
Oft in my little knowledge I have smiled
At mighty SHAKSPEARE, when I thought that he
Planted the deserts of “Bohemia wild”
Upon the shores of some mysterious sea,
An ocean whose existence had before
Escaped the ken of geographic lore.
But hark! the unknown “X.,” with loyal heart,
Defends the master from the mocking hosts:
Bohemia was in ancient times a part
O' the Holy Roman Empire, which had coasts,
And SHAKSPEARE, with the true poetic soul,
Spoke of the part while thinking of the whole.
So, too, when Proteus hastened, taking ship
From dry Verona, where waves never break,
To plain-begirt Milan, this was no slip–
ot, as one might have fancied, a mistake—
Are we to think our SHAKSPEARE more a fool
Than any urchin in the under-school?—
Verona meant the eastern coast, Milan
The western, in a vague and general way;
And one might well expect a hurried man,
Instead of riding hard a long, long day,
To coast round Italy—a charming cruise
Affording some inimitable views.
The poet tells us Delphi was the shrine
Of mediaeval Europe—yea, the core,
And doubtless Delphi was to him a sign
To symbolise all Europe—nothing more—
Which (Asia being joined) one might regard
As some great island, if one were a bard.
So when he talks of Delphi as an isle,
Though none but he observed a wavelet there,
Good friend, forbear the all too hasty smile,
And lay aside your rash, superior air:
More things in William SHAKSPEARE there may be
Than are dreamt of in your geography.

Cox (HAROLD), late Secretary of the Cobden Club, to the Right
| Hon. HENRY CHAPLIN, with reference to CoBDEN's early
habit of taking snuff :
I SEE it stated in a local paper that ConDEN, at the
beginning of his public career, was addicted to snuff-taking,
but that on being assured by Joseph BARKER, the well-known
temperance lecturer, that the practice would certainly injure
his voice, he then and there resolved to take snuff no more.
In these circumstances I wish to ask whether you are justified
in stating that Free Trade has been snuffed out by Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN ? [Sir Robert GIFFEN, £2 10s.]
WATSON (WILLIAM), Poet and Sultanicide, to Mr. TRAvis, the
American and English amateur golf champion, seeking
enlightenment as to the pronunciation of a golfing term:
DEAR SIR,--By way of promoting cordial relations between
England and America I contemplate writing a sonnet to the
Schenectady putter, the redoubtable implement which played
so prominent a part in your recent victory at Sandwich. My
only difficulty is that I am uncertain as to the correct
pronunciation of Schenectady. I can grapple with the
situation if the accent falls on the second or third syllable,
but if it is on the first I shall probably have to fall back on
some suitable periphrasis such as “mallet-headed weapon.”
An authoritative expression of opinion from you will place
[ANDREw KiRKALDY, 7s.6d.]
LANKESTER (Edwin RAy), Director of the Natural History
Museum, to the Dramatic Critic of the “Daily Tele-
graph,” on the subject of mermaids:
In a recent notice of the performance of a Parisian artist at
the Alhambra, I observe that you state that “by her graceful
and sinuous style” of dancing she suggested “the legendary
denizens of the ocean.” As the author of a monograph on
the “Cephalaspidian Fishes,” I should be much indebted to
you for a more precise definition of the denizens in question.
[Mr. CHARLEs MoRTON, 3s.6d.]
MILEs (EUsTACE), Athlete and Dietetic Reformer, to Mr. H. W.
MASSINGHAM, in regard to over-feeding at the Universities:
I had already noticed the painful announcement to which
you allude, viz., that “J. SHERLOCK, of Oxford, had broken
the sandwich record with a score of 71.” . Of course a good
deal would depend on the size of the sandwiches and their
composition, but, generally speaking, a sandwich implies
meat, so that this exploit, of which so much has been made
|by the Press and public, is doubly disgusting—first as a
mere piece of gluttony, and second as an act of carnivorous
excess. I entirely approve of your intention to bring the
matter before the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. As
a boy at school I remember once eating 13 hot cross buns,
but 71 sandwiches is quite another story.
[Mr. CADBURy, £33s.]
BALFOUR (The Right Hon. A. J.), Premier and Philosopher, to
Mr. CHARLES FROHMAN, in regard to a proposition from
the latter:
I regret, that I am unable to entertain your flattering pre-
posal, inspired by a recent performance at Camden Town,
that I should contribute the lyrics of a new musical comedy
to be called The Golf Girl, an American Travis-tee. The
claims of the Licensing Bill and other Parliamentary business
so fully occupy my time that I have been obliged to abandon
all literary work. Indeed, I have not yet made so much as
even the rough draft of my Presidential Address to the
British Association. Your alternative proposal, that I should

JEssop (GILBERT), Croucher, to TYLDESLEY, the Lancashire hard
hitter, asking his co-operation in getting a Haskell cricket
ball accepted by the M.C.C. :
. . . . You or I, I am confident, could hit one a mile. The
old monotony of sixes would thus disappear, and we should
make twenties or thirties, or even fifties at a single stroke.
A great deal is written about the reform of cricket. In my
opinion a rubber-cored ball would do everything that is
required. The only drawback that I can see is the possibility
that mid-on would have to wear armour plates. . . .

had in your stables a young horse named St. Amant, quiet
to ride or drive, which you might be willing to sell. I want
to give not more than sixty guineas, but of course a lower
sum would not displease me. I could at any rate promise
St. Amant a good home and an indulgent master.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LATE8T KIDNAPPING INTELLIGENGE,
ADVICEs from Carnarvon confirm the
rumour that Mr. LLoyd-GEORGE, who
suddenly disappeared from Westminster
a few days ago, has, by order of Lord
BURTON, been drugged, carried off to
North Berwick, and marooned on the
Bass Rock. Considerable anxiety pre-
vails amongst his constituents, as the
unfortunate Member is said to have
nothing to drink but Seagulls' syrup.
Negotiations are, however, pending
between his captor and Sir HENRY
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN, the former under-
taking to remove Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE to
the mainland if he pledges himself not
to open his lips in the House of Commons
before the next General Election, except
for the consumption of malt liquor.
After several attempts Sir EDWARD
Poynter has succeeded in kidnapping
the Earl of LyTroN. The unfortunate
nobleman is, it is understood, at this
moment lying handcuffed in the Diploma
Gallery, but the House of Lords have
practically decided to accept the terms
offered by the President of the Royal
Academy. These stipulate that the
Administration of the Chantrey Bequest
is to be unanimously approved by the
Upper House, that Mr. D. S. MACCoLL's
head is to be presented to the Tate
Gallery, and that a peerage is to be
bestowed on Mr. M. H. SPIELMANN.
Great distress has been caused in the
Bordesley Division of Birmingham by
the news that the Right Hon. JESSE
CoLLINGs has been carried off to sea in
his yacht by Mr. T. GIBSON Bowles. A
communication which has reached the
Admiralty states that the prisoner, who
is chained to the binnacle, will not be
released unless the following terms are
carried out: (1) Mr. Gibson Bowl Es, M.P.,
to be made First Lord of the Admiralty;
(2) Mr. Jesse CoILINGs to renounce his
allegiance to Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, and
assume the name of CoBDEN; (3) a ransom
of 30,000 acres of land and 10,000 cows
to be paid to Mr. Bowl.ES; (4) the name
of Mr. Collings to be struck off the list
of Privy Councillors, and that of Mr.
Bowies substituted.
Consternation reigns in the New
English Art Club. While recently
visiting the west coast of Ireland, Mr.
GEORGE MooRE was set upon by some
infuriated conger-eel fishers, to whom
he was reciting his “Avowals,” and
carried off in a coracle to the Arran
Islands, where he is immured in a bee-
hive cell, and fed exclusively on salt
fish, seed potatoes, and samphire pickles.
His captors have forwarded to Mr.
WYNDHAM, the Chief Secretary, an extra-
ordinary document formulating the con-
ditions on which they are prepared to
surrender their prize. hese are:
(1) that Mr. GEORGE MooRE is to give
up wearing a Celtic fringe; (2) that no
more portraits of Mr. GEORGE MooRE are
to be painted by members of the New
2nglish Art Club; (3) that he is to
devote his literary abilities to the sphere
of musical comedy; (4) that, as a com-
promise between the contending claims
of Ireland and England, he is to reside
henceforth in the Isle of Man.
Our West Kensington correspondent
telegraphs that there is only too good
reason to suppose that Mr. MoBERLY
BELL, the Manager of The Times, who
disappeared mysteriously a short time
ago, and in spite of the most ingeni-
ously-worded advertisements has not
yet been traced, has been captured by
BUFFALO BILL, and is now in durance
vile in the Indian village at Olympia.
Search-parties armed with every kind of
warrant have ransacked the great build-
ing, but the Indian village is impregna-
bly defended by SITTING BULL and a
bevy of devoted Braves. It is under-
stood that the only terms on which
Mr. MobFRLY BELL can be released are
his permission for BUFFALO BILL to change
his name to BUFFALO BELL, and the
supply of the Times to the great
impresario for the rest of his life at
three halfpence a copy. Negotiations
have been set on foot, but the feeling at
Printing-House Square is so strong
against circulating the paper at less
than twopence that much time may
elapse before his release is obtained.
The point as to BUFFALO BILL's change
of name was at once conceded.
Consternation, we understand, reigns
in Carlton House Terrace owing to the
sudden and forcible abduction of Sir
GILBERT PARKER early this morning by a
band of St. James's Park brigands,
under the command of MARCELINE, of
the Hippodrome. What Sir GILBERT
has done to excite the resentment of the
French mime no one at present can say,
although rumour is as usual busy.
Suffice it to say that the great states-
man retired to rest in the ordinary way
last night, and this morning he had
disappeared. He is reported to be
hidden in the Geological Museum in
Jermyn Street, one of London's in-
accessible fastnesses. Ambassadors have
visited MARCELINE in the hope of coming
to some arrangement, but as he conducts
his conversation entirely by whistles and
somersaults the affair is not proceeding
with the celerity that Sir GILBERT's
friends could desire. It has, however,
been elicited that MARCELINE’s terms
are a cash payment of two million
pounds, a free pardon to all con-
cerned, and a seat in Sir GILBERT's next
Cabinet.
The absence of Mr. Justice DARLING and
Mr. Plowden from their duties is not due
to indisposition, as was at first supposed,
but to a more serious cause. It now
transpires that they were both chloro-
formed on the Embankment and carried
off to Yorkshire, where they have been
immured in a cave on Smilesworth Moor.
A communication has, however, reached
the Lord CHANCELLOR intimating the
readiness of the writers to surrender
their prisoners on the understanding
that their places, as judge and magistrate
respectively, shall be filled up by the
appointment of Mr. HERBERT CAMPBELL
and Mr. GEORGE Robey. Friends of the
distinguished captives will be glad to
learn that they are both in excellent
health, and that in the punning competi-
tion with which they beguile the tedium
of their incarceration Mr. Plowdex's
jº stands at 371 to his opponent's
A WAY WE HAVE AT THE

[In the most recent Sherlock Holmes adventure
the guilt of reading an Examination Paper before
it was issued is brought home to an under-
graduate by the fact that, returning from the
University Athletic Ground, where he had been
practising the jump, he left “his tan gloves”
on a chair in his tutor's room. The two
following extracts are taken from stories shortly
to be published by Sir ARTH-R C-N-N D-YLE:]
I.
It was half-past six o'clock on the
evening of June 1, and HENRY BLESSING-
TON was walking across Midsummer Com-
mon on his way back from the river
Cam, where he had been engaged with
some of his friends and colleagues in
practising for the summer boat-races in
the celebrated College six-oared boat.
His face was flushed and an air of
determination sat not ungracefully on his
manly brow, for had he not been the
means that very afternoon of putting a
stop to the notorious crab-catching pro-
pensities of the Duke of DELAMERE, the
brawny ruffian who, in spite of his
drunken habits, wielded the bow-oar on
behalf of his Alma Mater. This feat had
rendered it certain that the St. Barnabas
six-oar would go head of the river to-
morrow. As he thought of the coming
triumph HENRY BLESSINGTON's blood
coursed feverishly through his veins, and
he proceeded mechanically to feel in the
pockets of his fashionable frock-coat for
his pipe and tobacco-pouch. Heavens !
they were not there! As he realised
his loss, a reading man, coming in the
opposite direction, collided with him and
trod heavily on both his patent leather
lace-up boots. Smothering an oath,
BLESSINGTON raised his gold-headed cane
i. struck the clumsy intruder a heavy

of tumultuous excitement. From every
side undergraduates, accompanied by

their parents and other more remote
relatives, were pouring in crowds to the
Schools to hear the Chancellor announce
the winner of the Classical Greats.
Every class was represented. Here a
scholar of Marcon's Hall, tastefully
arrayed in the conspicuous blazer of his
College Croquet Club, with his mortar-
board rakishly set on the side of his
head, might be seen arm in arm with
two sprigs of Britain's nobility, clothed
in the pink coat consecrated by an
immemorial tradition to the followers of
the Turl Hounds. Following these were
to be observed two of the fastest and
most brilliant members of Christ Church
College walking cheek by jowl with
their inseparable associates, the Captain
and Vice-Captain of the St. Edmund's
Hall Boat Club. The top hats which
graced the heads of the two latter
undergraduates had been freshly ironed
and their lavender kid gloves (the badge
of their aquatic prowess) shone across
the High Street with a lustre that con-
trasted strangely with the frayed trousers
and short Norfolk jacket of the Senior
Proctor, whose duty it was to fine every
tenth member of the assemblage.
TEE-TATTLE.
A GREAT many of our most sporting
golfers are now adopting the American
accent, which they find most helpful in
keeping the eye on the ball. The Trans-
Atlantic Grip is also coming into vogue:
it is an illusive rubber-cored grip, with
spry American-cloth ends.
The new Garden City links at the back
of CLARKSON's (where they let out wigs
for the greens) have been entirely fitted
with a smart line in flags: all those going
out have stripes, while home-coming
golfers see stars. There is an American
bar at the turn.
Some new strokes are coming to the
front, and it has recently been proved
that a sure green-fetcher, against the
wind, is the Sandy “hook,” which bids
fair to eclipse the old British “pull.”
The Broadway putt entirely counteracts
the narrowness of the hole.
Mr. HoRACE HUTCHINSON, the eminent
light-green golfer, has at last been able
to trace back the pedigree of Colonel
BoGEY, link by link, to an ancestor who
came over with CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUs.
From the same authority comes the
assurance that the first occasion upon
which GEORGE WASHINGTON used the
historic sentence, “I cannot tell a lie,”
was when he was accused by a caddie
of putting his foot upon his adversary's
ball while going to the eighteenth

medal day at Mount Vermon.
Out of respect for the country that
claims the new Amateur Golf Champion,
the anniversary of the battle of Bunker's
Hill, which occurs on the 17th inst., will
be observed as a day of self-denial by
all habitual swearers, throughout the
golf links of Great Britain.
At the mext meeting of the Royal and
Ancient Club, it will be mooted that the
caddies of the historic green be in
future requested to allude to their
national head-gear as their Tammanies.
A propos of golf garb, Roosevelt-soled

THAMES TRAGEDIES.
Jones says THERE is only one REALLY SAFE WAY of CHANGING PLACES IN A Skiff
THE REVOLT OF THE FARE.
THE grievances of the London cab-
users, after simmering for several
decades, have boiled over at last, and
a general strike is in progress through-
out the metropolis. Some inquiries
have been conducted by Mr. Punch's
Special Commissioner with a view to
obtain fresh light on a matter of no
small public importance.
It appears that the cab-users, as a
class, are an honest, intelligent, and
deserving set of people, and must not
be judged by the very small proportion
of bilkers and other black sheep among
their number. They are, in general,
highly respectable, a large number
being married, with families to support.
They pay gates and taxes, like other
citizens who do not Passively advertise
themselves. Cases of incivility and in-
sobriety while in the act of cab-riding
are becoming rarer every day.
Taking them all round, it may be
said that cab-users are hard-working
and conscientious according to their
lights. They are out in all weathers,
endeavouring to meet the calls of society,
and to fulfil the duties of shopping
or attendance at theatres and restau-
rants. The hours are long, and it is
sometimes three or four o'clock in
the morning before the labours of
members of the cab-using profession
are ended.
In these hard times, however, it is
frequently the case that the cab-rider
comes home to his wife with an empty
pocket, and we fear that he complains,
all too justly, that he cannot obtain a
living wage. The extortions of the cab-
drivers and the depredations of the
luggage-touts have left him but little
wherewith to rear and educate his grow-
ing family. Small wonder is it, then,
that he is dissatisfied with the way in
which his wrongs have been hithertº
ignored. Cab-users, feminine as well
as masculine, were inarticulate: at the
time of the ASQUITH arbitration, but
since then powerful arguments in their
favour have come forward in the shape
of Tubes, motors, and electric trams, and
they are determined to bring matters to
a head.
Several mass meetings have been held,
not altogether without result, within the
last few days. At a gathering of cab-
riding Peers and Members of Parliament
in the yard at St. Stephen's at 12.30 A.M.
last Thursday night, in answer to the
cry of “Who goes home?” it was
unanimously resolved that they would
do so on foot, as a protest against the
tyrannical action of the cabdrivers in
boycotting the Legislature. It was
further agreed that the money which
the theatrical and dance-frequenting would otherwise have been spent on
fares should be devoted to the settlement
of cobblers' bills on account of wear and
tear of shoe-leather.
Some impassioned speeches by titled
strikers and others were delivered at
the Church Parade in Hyde Park near
the Achilles statue last Sunday in
favour of a widened radius, the aboli-
tion of gratuities, and the introduction
of taxameters. A collection was made
in support of the strike fund. Pickets
were stationed at the various entrances
of the Park to observe any blackleg cab-
riders. All who were not wearing the
pink Union ticket on their silk or picture
hats were invited to dismount. Small
flags marked FAIR, for insertion in the
buttonhole, were distributed for the pur-
pose of tantalising any drivers who
mň. be shaky in spelling.
The result of these operations has
been the speedy reduction of the London
cabmen to reason. A conference was held
yesterday in which they agreed, pending
a final settlement, to accede to most of
the cab-users' demands, viz., to accept the
bare legal fare without demur, to refrain
from crawling, to drive straight to the
point, to go where ordered (even to a
remote suburb), and to come when
whistled for.
P.S.—The latest news is that there is
now a strike among the horses on
account of overwork. Mr. P.'s Com-
missioner is still whistling for his cab.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 6.
—The stars in their courses fight for
PRINCE ARTHUR. Seemed at opening of
to-day's sitting he had really got into
tight place. House in Committee on
Licensing Bill. No disguise of reluct-
ance on part of some exceptionally
influential Ministerialists to support
Clause II., which creates freehold in
liquor licences by enacting payment of
compensation on non-renewal. Ready
for anything reasonable; constitutionally
opposed to confiscation; but insist that
duration of compensation system shall be
limited by term of years sufficient to safe-
guard traders who secured their licence
under the now existing law—which, by
the way, makes it subject to withdrawal at
the end of every twelve months. Opposi-
tion, seeing opportunity of filching votes,
accordingly tabled amendments limiting
claim for compensation to periods vary-
ing from seven to twenty-one years.
This PRINCE ARTHUR's new difficulty.
If the thing were well managed, enough
Ministerial votes would be drawn to
make the division an unpleasantly near
thing. Urgent Whip out summoning
the faithful to the ramparts. House
presents appearance long unfamiliar;
benches crowded on both sides; Opposi-
tion elate, expectant; Ministerialists
depressed, complaining, murmuring
mutiny at a leadership that, crossing a
bridge leading to neral Election,
grabs at the shadow of the publican's
vote and loses the substance, represented
by vote of the Church, the Temperance
party, and all the higher levels of
Conservatism.
“And in this case,” said Mr. J. G.
TALBOT, with a wan smile, “the substance
is in peculiar sense “the cheese.’”
Before Committee had sat an hour
situation was reversed. It was the Minis-
terialists who were jubilant, the Oppo-
sition cast down. And all through ELLIS
GRIFFITH, loyalest of Liberals.
In ordinary plans of campaign, as for
example that environing Port Arthur, it
is customary for the arbitrary direction
of movement to be left in the hands of
Commander-in-Chief. If at the critical
moment, when advancing to attack, a
full private or an epauletted captain
were to dash in with a manoeuvre
entirely his own, its progress would be
interrupted at initial stage by the stra-
tegist being shot through the head
by comrades nearest at hand. Liberals,
whether in Opposition or in office,
manage things much better. Every
man in the ranks is as good as another,
much better than any statesman on the
front bench. The Member for Anglesey
didn't mean any harm. He was not in
i the private pay of Ministers. No one
LANDED HIS PARTY IN A BUNKER.
Mr. Ell-s Gr-ff-th.
more honestly or hotly objected to un-
limited duration of the Compensation
Clause. Only it would be a glory to
gallant little Wales, an honour to
Anglesey, if, pushing ahead of the
ordered programme, he raised question
of time limit on Clause I., leaving
the score or more of Members with
amendments to Clause II. grinding their
teeth. Accordingly moved amendment
limiting operation of Clause I. to seven
years.
Houldsworth, Unionist Member for
Manchester, whose expected help in
resisting unlimited compensation was
of inestimable value to Opposition,
pointed out that Clause I., whilst in-
volving payment of compensation, also
dealt with the transference to Quarter
Sessions of the jurisdiction of local
justices. Hostile to unlimited compen-
sation, he was in favour of the latter
provision and could not support an
amendment that abolished it at the end
of seven years. And Houldsworth spoke
for a score or more Ministerialists on
whose vote Opposition counted.
Here was a pretty pickle ! The ruth-
less Chairman increased its pungency
by ruling that, if conditions of compen-
sation were discussed on ELLls GRIFFITH's
amendment, question might not be re-
opened in its proper place on Clause II.
ELLIS GRIFFITH begged leave to withdraw
his amendment. Ministerialists laughed
loud and long. A man revoking in
a game of bridge played for high stakes
might just as well seek to avoid the
penalty by asking leave to withdraw the
card and play another. Chagrin of
Opposition not modified by consideration
that they had been out-manoeuvred by
an adroit enemy. Marching along with
confidence to take up a strong position,
they had wantonly strayed and now
found themselves in a bog.
Business done. —Licensing Bill in
Committee. Opposition make bad
Start.
Tuesday, midnight.-The spectacle of
Mr. CRooks seated below the Gangway
wearing somebody else's opera hat what
time he hurled objurgation at the Chair
would have caused palpitation in Poplar
had the constituency been in sight of
its esteemed representative. But Poplar
was in bed, or ought to have been. It
was within a few minutes of midnight,
a circumstance which, taken in conjunc-
tion with the opera hat and the inflamed
gestures, suggested that the honourable
Member was affording practical illustra-
tion of necessity' for more stringent
supervision of the Licensing Laws.
The suspicion was absolutely un-
founded, wholly unworthy. The fact is,
PRINCE ARTHUR had moved the closure
on further debate of the ELLIS GRIFFITH
amendment. House cleared for a divi-
sion. In accordance with quaint
etiquette established before Queen ANNE
was dead, a Member desiring to address
the Chair must, in such circumstances,
remain seated, wearing his hat. At the
moment Mr. CRooks didn't happen to
have a hat with him. Struggling to his
feet he was received with roar of con-
tumely from upholders of law and order
opposite. Pulled down by the coat tails
by friends near him, he showed disposi-
tion to have it out with somebody.
“What did they mean by roaring, ‘Put
on yer 'at’? I haven't got a nat,” he
growled.
It was then CATHCART WASON came to
his aid. Strolling in from the opera,
or other resort of fashionable Scotch
Members, he carried his opera hat under
his arm. Releasing the structure with
a bang that sounded above the tumult
wº-
Mr. Cr-ks, being without his own hat, disappears
inside the opera-hat of Mr. W-s-n.

been talked round through two long
sittings. If all that was to be said pro
and con. could not be uttered in that
period opportunity must have been
wantonly wasted.
Much reason to fear that Mr. CRooks's
emotion arose from circumstance that
he contemplated contribution to the
debate and had missed earlier open-
ings. This regrettable; but on the
whole the Member for Poplar cannot
complain of inadequate share of a week's
talk. In fact he is in danger thus early
in a promising Parliamentary career of
wrecking it by excessive garrulity. It
would be a pity, for, otherwise, the
House listens to him gladly. Recognises
in him a valuable addition to the class
of labour representatives who form one
of its most respected and influential
sections. A capital speaker, through
his first quarter of an hour; knows
what he is talking about; illustrates his
theme with flashes of homely humour.
But alack! he doesn't know when to
sit down.
As the MEMBER For SARK, fresh from
Sir WILLIAM Pollitr's dinner to a nota-
ble group of railway managers, says,
“Crooks's speech lacks terminal facili-
ties.”
The other day, in Committee of Sup-
ply, he spoke on the Local Government
vote for forty minutes by Westminster
clock. That would be unpardonable
even in debate on the second reading of
an important Bill. In Committee a
man is not expected to make a speech;
his business is to contribute brief
practical talk in elucidation of the point
immediately at issue.
Mr. CRooks is too excellent a force to
be wasted, too good a man to be spoiled.
Salvation for him would come by the
realisation of CARNE RASCH's dream of
compulsorily shortened speeches. Heard
much to-day and yesterday about time
limit for compensation, in the interests
of reducing inebriety in drink. A time
limit designed to minimise inebriety in
speech, is scarcely of less importance.
Pending enactment of RASCH's proposal
a friendly word in Mr. CRooks's ear may
be effective.

CHARIVARIA.
WE have had a big stroke of luck in
the war against Tibet. Our ultimatum
has been returned with an impertinent
message. This insult justifies the
War.
The Women's International Congress,
now sitting at Berlin, demands “the
absolute equality of the sexes.” Yet
(and this is characteristic of female im-
practicability) no means have been sug-
gested for raising the male sex to the
standard attained by the other.
A new disease, known as the “shaking
sickness,” has made its appearance in
Swiss schools, and it is feared it will
become necessary to close some of these
institutions. Many English schoolboys
have given orders for a specimen of the
bacillus to be forwarded to them as soon
as it is discovered.
People continue to complaim of the
plague of gnats. We understand that
a good defence is to bathe the face twice
a day in liquid glue. The insects will
stick to this without inflicting further
irritation. -
The Noroe Vremya is wroth with
Great Britain. The war, it declares, “is
largely due to the provocation and com-
plicity of a third i. But the Novoe
Vremya forgets that, even if the allega-
tion were true, Russia ought to be
grateful to us for giving her the oppor-
tunity of wiping the “yellow monkeys”
off the face of the earth.
It has again been suggested that in
future any defaulting South American
Republic shall be annexed by the United
States. It would, we take it, be incor-
porated with the State of Iowa.
Boots for dogs are declared to be the
latest fashionable novelty. But it has
long been the custom to supply these
articles to cats, when they sing too much
at night-time.
Paragraphs have been appearing in
several papers on the subject of the
strange uses to which old tram-cars are
put, but no mention is made of the
strangest use of all to which they are
put in some parts of London, namely,
that of tram-cars. -
The Wyedomosti, of St. Petersburg,
approves of Mr. HENRY Norman, M.P.
It serves him right.
A music-hall performer, now appear-
ing in London, has stated that she was
offered £525 a week to stay in Chicago.
Whether this sum was offered by London
or Chicago has not transpired.
The Motor Car declares, on high medi-
cal authority, that motoring is a cure for
insanity. We would therefore recom-
mend several motorists we know to
persevere. - -
A lad named John JAMES Johnson was
recently knocked down by a van driven

Curiously enough, they were not related,

“If there are any poets or poetesses
here,” said Mr. ALFREd AUSTIN, speaking
to the Dante Society, “my advice to you
is “Do not let Society spoil you.’” Can
the Laureate have inadvertently confused
himself with that other ALFRED who was
“England's Darling”?
Italy and Germany are not the only
countries which are desirous of increas-
ing their navies. The American cruiser
Tacoma, according to a cable, has recently
started from Honolulu in search of the
war-sloop Livan, which sailed from
Hilo in 1859 and has not been reported
since. ---
The conflict in the Far East has led
to a great outbreak of military activity
in almost every quarter of the globe.
Even Australia is up and doing. A

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR MR. JABBERJEE
IX.
In Lower Regions, Korea.
May 16.
PERHAPs, Sir, when your aquiline optics have scanned the
above heading, you will wonder why in the name of Dickens
I am descending the Korean Peninsular, in place of pressing
myself forward into the Japanese Wan, which is now occu-
pied in making alarms and excursions amongst the Wilds of
Manchuria?
Undoubtedly, had I merely consulted the interests of the
Chittagong Evening Conch, the proper address to find me
would by this time have become once more, like that of the
Juvenile Hibernian Minstrel, in the ranks of War.
But I am proud to say that, in my duel capacity of “Punch
Representative” and “War Correspondent,” I have always
considered that the former is entitled to precedency. I am
here solely for the advancement of yourself and Periodical!
For I was lately in receipt of a friendly tip from the
officiating Bonze that he was now in apple-pie orders for
inaugurating Punch's Temple. [ED. CoM.–Mr. Jabberjee
has been more than once informed that nothing but a pro-
found scepticism as to the existence of any such structure
prevented us from cabling to stop such nonsense at once.]
I am not ignorant that, in one or two of your fatherly
epistles, you have hinted that for no consideration would
you be induced to lend your open and benevolent countenance
for any heathenish idolatries, and of course I easily under-
stood that (officially) you could hardly return any other
response without causing rather grave scandal in ortho-
doxical English Home Circles!
But Irecalled from my Shakspearian readings that Richard,
when Duke of Glostershire, on being offered the crown by
Hon'ble Mark Antony, as Earl of Bucks, did refuse it no less
than three times, for the sake of appearances—and I should
be deplorably lacking in Mother's wit if I could not read
between the apparently hard and fast lines of your repudiation.
However, by all means make a whipping-post of myself as
escaped goat, if necessary—even to the extent of exhibiting
me to public execrations as an unauthorised fanatical.
Though it is superfluous to protest that I am not so utterly
benighted as to be a believer in Demonology—which I
regard, like most other philosophers, as purely the matter
of policy and climate |
till, I am bold enough to suspect that, behind a frowning
mask, you are concealing a secretly approving simper. In
this persuasion I am vastly encouraged by the recollection of
having once seen a published description of a certain Inner
Chamber of Punch's Office, wherein, so it was alleged, your-
self and staff are wont to assemble for mystic and secret
discourses. For, from photos of this apartment illustrating
said article, I was dumfoundered to perceive that it contained
no less than two large-sized “Punch" effigies of such un-
paralleled hideosity that it is almost inconceivable they could
be ºthere merely as ornaments. . . . Then, pray, for what,
Misters? . . . Please answer that question in the privacy of
own bosoms, before protruding your tongues in hypocritical
horror at practices by less highly educated Korean natives!
Be this as it may, you would be, I venture humbly to
assert, somewhat less than human if your cordial cockles are
not to indulge in suppressed cheerings on receiving intelli-
gence of the splendid success which your idol has already
obtained in these localities.
It has been christened the “Chin-Tung-Konk” (the
Garrulous god with the Truly Magnificent Proboscis), and
no idol could have been honoured with a more auspicious
“send-off” at its temple-warming.
My friend the Bonze, though by birth of Buddhistic
opinions, is a broad-minded, unprejudiced 'old chap who is
IN THE FAR EAST.

willing to recognise any rival religion, provided it is rendered
worth his while.
He is also (as I think I mentioned) a fermenting admirer
of your pictorial waggery, though totally unable to read the
accompanying letterpresses. I am instructing him in the
elementary principles of English Humour, and he will, I
believe, be competent, after a few more lessons, to com-
prehend (and—who knows?—perhaps, even, to compose !)
the simpler kind of witticisms.
Indeed, he is already impatient to figure as the Occasional
Contributor—but I have gently reminded him that he is not
to expect that he can gallop before he has learnt to toddle.
I will now proceed to describe the inaugural ceremonies,
and if, after reading same, you can remain impervious to
lively sentiments of obligation towards one who prefers to
remain anonymous—then I must reluctantly endorse the
good old sore that “There is only one place in which we
may be certain of finding Gratitude—to wit, the Dictionary.”
(Kindly excuse chestnuts!)
Now to resume. After the adjoining devil-tree had,
according to native customs and etiquettes, been duly
suspended with innumerable rags representing orisons, the
congregation adjourned to interior of shrine, where they
performed highly elaborated genuflections before a very
handsomely gilded and decorated Punch idol, to which they
presented offerings of boiled rice, inexpensive sweetstuffs,
and cakes in small copper trays. (These offerings, I should
mention, were religiously consumed on following day by the
officiating clergy, who were subsequently taken so severely
unwell that I was under the distressing apprehension that
my friend the Bonze, in particular, was to kick the bucket!)
Next, I read vivá voce a few selected extracts from your
esteemed issue of April 20, with running exegetical comments,

which were received by all present with awestruck reverence
as a Voz Dei.
After that, the venerable Bonze favoured your image with
some rather fine Terpsichorean performances, accompanied
on a drum, a brazen gong, a cracked bell, and a pair of
twinkling cymbals, by his assistant acolytes.
But, although the said Bonze's toe was undeniably fantastic,
I am not prepared to testify from personal experience that it
was of any exceptional levity—while, as to the ecclesiastical
orchestra, they kicked up so cacophonous and deafening a
din that it was not unworthy even of a London Charivari!
Altogether, it was a scene of the wildest enthusiasms. At
least fifteen converts, after expressing a vehement desire to
become life-subscribers to your respectable periodical, were
removed in cataleptic convulsions before I could even ascer-
tain their names and addresses.
The proceedings then terminated with a display of native
fireworks and other festivities, and I may safely say that your
shrine is now launched in the fairway of business. Indeed,
sundry older-established devils are already putting up their
shutters, and my friend the Bonze has coyly confided to me
that he will not be greatly surprised if the Punch idol were,
by-and-by, to bring off some minor miracle or other!
The question now is: what line are you going to take? . . .
It is of course open to you to upset your own apple-cart
by giving the chuck to myself. But why, impetuous Sir,
why cut off your face to spite your nose? When meat is
overdone, you cannot induce it to return to raw material by
a mere declaration to that effect. So my advice is that you
should assume the virtue that you haven't got, and not
tender yourself (to say nothing of your humble servant!) a
fool by publicly admitting that you are totally undeserving
of divine honours.
Leave such assertions to others, and do not be such an
ill-natured old bird as to render your own nest unfit for
habitation'
By the way, the Bonze's bill for dancing and use of
assistants only comes to yen 35, as he has made the great
reduction in his customary charges, owing to his inordinate
love and affection for the presiding deity of your illustrious
serial
There are not improbably several Editors of acknowledged
eminence who would rush baldheadedly into such an Al
opening, and gladly endow almost any Korean shrine in
perpetuity, simply as the advertising medium.
Surely you are not to be behind The Times in blowing
your own boom!
P.S.—I have paid BonzE & Co. out of my private pocket,
in the childlike assurance that my damascened cheek will
not be reduced to the misery of blushing for Hon'ble Punch
as a parsimonious! Sho-ji is slightly better. H. B. J.
WENUS’S LOOKING-GLASS.
THE sympathetic action of the Woodbridge District Council
in erecting a mirror at some cross roads for the benefit of
motorists has met with general approval. There is some un-
certainty, however, as to whether the glass is intended to
reflect round-the-corner traffic for the information of the
driver, or whether it is placed there for the benefit of the
lady in the tonneau. In any case it has been noticed that
cars bearing what are presumably members of the fair sex
refuse to pass the glass, and that the cross roads have further
become a favourite resort for lady bicyclists and short-skirted
pedestrians. The crowd, however, has so far been quite
orderly and good-tempered, falling into the queue and patiently
waiting according to the police instructions until each gets
her proper turn. In order, however, to prevent undue con-
gestion, it has been proposed that a mirror should be placed
at every other milestone, so as to distribute the traffic.
MOM US AT THE APOLLO THEATRE.
PRETTY music and faces, bright scenes and costumes, some
tuneful voices, a few catching melodies well sung, laughably
eccentric acting and spontaneously comic dialogue, all con-
tribute towards the making a genuine success for the
comic opera Véronique, now gaily running at the Apollo
Theatre. The music by M. ANDRé MESSAGER is light and
sparkling, and the piece itself is equidistant from Figaro on
the one hand and La Grande Duchesse on the other, and far
off from both. The music has little in it to remind us of
AUBER ; and not much, save where there are a few bars of
dance between the verses, or at the end of a song or chorus,
to recall OFFENBACH. Nor has it either the sweet melody of
AUDRAN, nor the dash of PLANQUETTE. It is MESSAGER, not at
his very best, but in a bright and pleasant mood.
Miss RosſNA BRANDRAM sings a melodious song so well as
to gain an encore. Hers is not a particularly funny part, but
it would be difficult to name anyone with a trained voice,
and with Miss BRANDRAM's experience in this line of business,
who could make so much of the character as she succeeds in
doing. As Agatha, Miss KITTY GoRDON, distinguishing herself
by her dash and go in singing, dancing, and acting, toujours
dans le mouvement, is one of the chiefest of the “lifes and
souls” of the opera. Miss SYBIL GREY, the sprightly repre-
sentative of Denise, dances so cleverly as to assist Mr. AUBREY
FITZGERALD, the idiotic Seraphim, in winning an encore for
their united efforts in the Second Act. All the ladies of the
period, 1840, harmoniously singing, are, individually and
collectively as chorus, charming; while the tuneful dandies,
their companions, distinguish themselves not only by the airs
they give themselves and by their correct rendering of the airs
given them by the composer, but also by their graces accord-
ing to the colour and variety of the tight-fitting costumes.
Miss RUTH VINCENT as the heroine, Hélène de Solanges,
enters thoroughly into the humour of the unoriginal light-
comedy plot, which is simply a variant of She Stoops to
Conquer and other similar farces, singing and acting delight-
fully, securing encores (a genuine triple encore in the last Act,
which she sensibly declined to take), and dividing the
honours of the duets with Mr. Lawrence REA (representing
her lover Florestan, a stiff-jointed youth in correct but
awkward attire), whose charm of voice atones for what is
lacking to him histrionically. But the tenor who can act as
well as he sings, what a rara avis is he'
Mr. FRED EMNEY as Mons. Loustot (why “Mons.” 2) makes
the most of an eccentric part. But it is to Mr. GEORGE GRAVEs
as Mons. Coquemard (again why “Mons.”?) that a clear two-
thirds of the success of this piece (apart from its music) is
due. He is the drollest of the droll, and his quite irrepressi-
ble fun, being now at its freshest and not as yet stereotyped,
is heartily enjoyed not only by the audience, who take
his every joke and go into ecstasies of mirth over all his
eccentricities, but also by those on the scene with him,
who are compelled to turn aside in order to dissemble their
laughter, while even the conductor of the orchestra and his
musicians are fain to smile in sympathy. That the source
of all this amusement is to be found either in the adaptation
by Mr. HENRY HAMILTON, or in the original, is open to con-
siderable doubt.
Though there is nothing particularly novel in the situations
(for the donkey trio and the “swing” duet are not unfamiliar
to play-goers), yet is it all bright, light and sparkling; while
that drollissimo Mr. GEORGE GRAVEs (how queerly inappro-
priate the name!) as Coquemard, is irresistibly comic.
Russia's position in the Far East seems worse than it was
in the Crimean War. She now has no Steppes in the neigh-
bourhood to climb down by.

balcony leading to the bedroom was enthusiastically
acclaimed, and the “Caro mome” having been rapturously
encored Mlle. SELINA KURz had to descend the staircase—
rather a come-down for her—make a graceful Kurzy, repeat
her success, give her gracious ascent, and once more make her
top-notable exit. Bravissima She must be immortalised

delicious melody to which are set the words of the modern

the Don) as good, and as wicked, as ever. The excellent
Mme. KIRKBY LUNN is compelled to come out to-night un-
commonly strong as the merry Maddalena, especially in the
last quartette, which is splendidly given and rapturously
taken by the house. M. RENAUD, as the unhappy jester who
is the victim of his own practical jokes, arouses the sympathy
of the audience by his acting, and gains their applause by his
singing. Altogether, with the marvellous musicians under
Master MANCINELLI, this is one of the very best of this season's
good nights.

Is this deponent quite a Wagnerite? Is Mr. P.'s Represen-

is a Lohengrinite, a moderate Tannhäuserite, a thorough
Flying-Dutchmanite, and a considerable bit of a Meister-
singerite. But is he a Tristan-und-Isolde-ite? As far as
the dramatic music for orchestra is concerned, emphatically
and enthusiastically “Yes”; but when we come to the vocal
operatic part that represents the acted story, most decidedly
“No.” For rather would this deponent see tableaux vivants
illustrating WAGNER's dramatic explanatory music, than hear
the apparently painful efforts of sweet singers straining to
get in a shout here and there, while utterly at a loss to invent
such variety of action as shall relieve the dreary monotony of
the wearisome proceedings.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
in WAGNER is to argue yourself “out of it,” and not up to the
growing fashion of the day. But the majority, probably not
j, qualified to be out-and-out Wagnerites, are, how-
ever, Wagnerites with a difference. They nightly crowd in to
hear him, and whether they are henceforth to vote solid for
WAGNER, or not, the next season will show. The plot of Tristan
und Isolde is spun-out, and there must be the very perfection
of acting and singing to prevent it from becoming tedious,
as an opera, after the first half hour. When the DE REszKES
were in it, with Mlle. MEISSLINGER and Madame ALBANI, the
most bigoted anti-Wagnerite was inclined to yield. But with
Herr WAN Dyck as Tristan, Fräulein PLAICHINGER as Isolde,
and Herr HINCKLEY as King Marke, good as they all are, it is
a different matter. Comparisons must not be drawn, and
criticism is superfluous. One can only wonder at, and
praise, the energy displayed in the singing, and also in the
dramatic action, which it is difficult for all to appreciate at
its true value. It is Dr. RICHTER’s personally conducted
orchestra that rivets the attention; to those mainly inte-
rested in the music the singers are “such stuff as dreams are
made on.” We listen, we close our eyes, and we enjoy it.
Fräulein PLAICHINGER's acting is semaphorical: it may be
descriptively summed up as “arms and the woman.” Herr
HINCKLEY's King Marke is pathetic, and Herr WAN Dyck's
impersonation of the mesmerised amorous Tristan arouses
our pity for the good man gone wrong. Madame KIRKBY
LUNN as the confidante Brangäne succeeds in making the
character intelligible to the audience, in spite of her having
to pass so much of her time in a corner with her face to the
wall like a naughty infant-school-girl. By the way poor
King Marke is condemned to a similar position, for quite
twenty minutes in the Second Act, without having done any-
thing whatever to deserve such treatment. How operatic
actors of experience can lend themselves to such puerile
stage-business as that with the “property” cup, broad
and shallow, which, choke-full of liquid “potion,” they wave
about with enough recklessness to cause every drop to be spilt,
is something that utterly passes any ordinary comprehension.
A master of dramatic music in the orchestra, WAGNER was
but a child in the nursery of dramatic art on the stage.
BLOSSOMING.
IF, on Tuesday the 7th, at the end of the matinée at His
Majesty's, when a highly-finished performance of Twelfth
Night had been given in aid of “The Fresh Air Fund,” Mr.
TREE “was delighted,” as he so heartily expressed himself,
“to find that the presence of that audience would give a day
of fresh air and happiness to twenty thousand little children,”
how still more pleased must he have been that the successful
début of his daughter, Miss WIOLA, should have crowned the
memorable occasion. Of good omen is it that this charming
representative of a branch of the Family Tree (the others,
olive branches, on this occasion were packed in a box) should
be a youthful actress who gave considerable promise by a
most creditable performance.
On any débutante playing Viola in Twelfth Night, what
greater praise can be bestowed than to say, “She is Viola"?
Now this is, in a sense, true of Miss Viola TREE. The young
lady is Mr. TREE's Viola, but is she SHAKSPEARE's? Not
quite as yet: but let other Violas look to their laurels; there
may be a TREE growing up to overshadow them. With
pleasure will the Père TREE watch the fruit a-ripening.
Mr. Punch wishes her health, happiness, and success!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THERE is nothing particularly new or strikingly original in
Mrs. ADELINE SERGEANT's latest romance, entitled Malincourt
Keep (John LoNG), and yet from first to last it interests the
reader, who will not willingly be interrupted in its perusal
until the uttermost chapter has been reached and finished.
To a certain extent the story recalls the ancient legend of
Blue Beard, that is of Baron Abomelique, who so fascinates
the girl with whom he has fallen in love that she vehe-
mently protests against the idea of her having the slightest
desire to pry into the Blue Chamber, wherein is carefully
guarded the strange secret of his life. Perhaps this hint
may just whet the excitement-lover's appetite for sensation,
and the Baron hereby gives such an one to understand, in
the language of the much-married Mr. Adolphus Tetterby,
that “astonishment will be the portion of that respected con-
temporary.”
In writing Every Man his own Gardener (HopDER AND
STOUGHTON) Mr. John HALSHAM addresses himself primarily to
people who with little or no experience find themselves the
possessors of about as much garden as they think they can
manage single-handed. It is a multitudinous class, and they
will find in this work the verything they want. Mr. HALSHAM
knows his garden aw fond–or lower still, at least a yard
deep, where by dint of digging he begins his study of the
sort of soil he has to deal with. Having acquired that
essential information Paterfamilias, young, middle-aged, or
just retired from business, will find set forth, in simple
language, practical instructions for dealing with his plot
through the revolving seasons. Few people take keener
delight in a garden than does my Baronite. He, however,
draws the line at labouring in it with spade or hoe. But he
intends to leave this book casually lying about where it will
come under the notice of those who do, confident that they
will gain many useful hints. The volume is charmingly
lººd by CARINE CADBY, the Rev. F. C. LAMBERT, and the
author.
In future the Baron will be on his guard against trusting
Mr. GUY Boothby with any mystery that he does not wish to
become public property. This author has got hold of An
Ocean Secret, and he can't keep
it to himself! And what hap-
pens? Messrs. F. W. WHITE &
Co. absolutely sell the secret,
which GUY B. has confided to
them, for money!! So thrilling
is the first sensational shock, that
subsequent proceedings fail in
piling up the agony quick enough
to meet the demand of the ex-
pectant reader. Whether the
secret is worth knowing or not,
the aforesaid reader will decide
for himself when he has mas-
tered it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHARIVARIA.
IN the midst of the turmoil of war
the courteous Japanese still find time
to think of the entertainment of their
guests. The steamer Manchuria has
just left for a month's pleasure trip
with the foreign naval attachés and a
number of war-correspondents aboard.
If it can be managed, the excursion will
cover a visit to the seat of war.
The Shah of PERSIA has heard that
the interests of England and France
are now identical, and his Majesty has
placed with a Leeds firm an order for
clothes which has hitherto gone to France.
If anything further were required to
convince the American public of the
contemptible character of RAISULI, the
Moroccan brigand who captured one of
their countrymen, it is provided by
his refusal to appear as an exhibit at
the St. Louis Exhibition.
At length the public is to have a
chance of learning what measures intro-
duced into Parliament are really worthy
of support. “It is my intention during
the remainder of the present Parlia-
ment,” writes Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL,
“to vote as far as possible according to
the merits of the various questions upon
which divisions are taken.”
The only other political news of any
importance is that Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-
BANNERMAN doesn't much like Im-
perialism, and Lord RosBBERY doesn't
much like Home Rule, and the rest of
the Liberal Party don't much like the fact
that Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN and
Lord RoseBERY don't like the same thing.
The minister of a Jersey City church
has invited ladies to attend service without
their hats so that they may worship in
comfort during the hot summer weather.
There is something peculiarly naive in
the idea that a lady could “worship in
comfort” without her latest hat.
Last week the Young Abstainers'
Union celebrated its Silver Jubilee. It
is satisfactory to know that the number
of heavy drinkers under seven years of
age is constantly decreasing.
The Primate has been urging the
younger clergy to “take an active part in
the games which the youth of the parish
engage in,” and curates playing pitch-
and-toss in the streets will soon be a
common sight.
An attempt is to be made to put
an end to the scandal of half-empty
churches in London by building more.

TO AN AFRICAN POTENTATE.
HIGH potentate of Ethiop's burning zone,
Or other regions yet more vaguely known,
Whose temperature—or so the travellers tell–
Closely approximates to that of h-l;
Whose simple sons lead uneventful lives,
Girt with a pleasing plethora of wives,
And only leave their fastnesses to plumb
The deep delights of stove-pipe hats and rum;-
Blest monarch, whose enlightened laws allot
Contentment to the wistful Hottentot,
Whereof the radiating joy suffuses
His pert but not unlovable papooses;–
Inform us, Sire, before you really go,
Just how you view our European show;
Say, is our climate all too keenly felt
By one whose swart yet unresisting pelt
Had never learned the subtle charm that clings
To what are loosely known as trouserings,
Or ventured out to take the evening air
Draped to distraction in a tightish pair;
But modestly confined its simple needs
To something matty in the way of beads;
Or else, like ADAM, previous to the Fall,
Meandered forth with nothing on at all?
And tell us, did our frigid British dame
Strike you as being just a trifle tame;
Or were you instantaneously smitten
By her profound resemblance to a kitten ?
And did you lightly, ere you left these shores,
Order a gross or two from Someone's Stores?
Tell us with what a rising sense of zeal
You viewed our projects for the public weal;
And all those homely sights so dear to us,
The fleeting splendours of the omnibus,
The British workman, suffering but dumb,
The Stock Exchange's oof-extracting hum,
The Press, the House of Commons, and the Zoo-
What sense of awe did these inspire in you?
Monarch, I may be wrong, but I suspect
That they misjudged your supple intellect
Who took you round, as current news relates,
To waxwork shows and charitable fêtes,
And bade you squander sleepless days and nights
On what are vulgarly described as “sights,”
Hoping to graft upon your native graces
The social virtues of the Western races.
I think your mind, oppressed with cares of state,
Dreamed of departure at an early date
Back to the land where courtesies are few,
And well-bred strangers make a perfect stew;
That land whose denizens, devoid of vice,
Exhale a pleasant atmosphere of spice;
Where sportsmen in an ecstasy of glee
Track to his lair the trembling chimpanzee,
Or hurl the flight of well-directed spears
About the hippopotamus his ears;
The land, in fact, whose artless youth is blest
With an instinctive aptitude for jest;
Where monarchs live a life of splendid ease,
And always do exactly as they please.

A MORNING CALL AT THE NEW GALLERY.
THE portrait of Herr JoACHIM, chief of violinists, stands on
an easel all by itself in the North Room. Solus cum solo it
is, and the solo would have been emphatically impressed
upon everyone had Herr JoACHIM appeared in the picture
with his favourite instrument. It has no number, though it
might easily have been number one, and apart from all the
others. None can approach SARGENT in this line, and as this
is true the spectator will be well advised to keep as far off
as possible. Distance lends enchantment to it at present;
and this portrait of the incomparable violinist only requires
to get the proper time in order to perfect the tone. -
#. the South Room we have Mr. SARGENT's portrait of
HENRY W. Lucy, our “Toby.” Excellent. So alert is he,
and so starting out of the frame, as to suggest that a
sufficient and appropriate legend to it might have been
simply “Who said, ‘Rats'?” Why was it not in the Aca-
demy? may be asked by the thoughtless. . Why? because
the fit and proper place for so eminent a Parliamentary
Reporter is of course “The Gallery.” -
Next to attract us is a picture by G. F. WATTs, O.M., R.A.,
of a nude boy who, having attempted to bathe, has been
frightened by the waves. #. is, nuda veritas, “the little
i. boy” known to all reciters of INGoLDSBY's poem.
The title might have been “Waif and Waves.” But Watts
in a name? Nothing, except when the name is WATTs, and
then there's very much.

275. All of a twist! Powerful portrait of a lady in an
agony of hesitation. Notice grip of her left hand on arm
of chair: likewise how she grasps, with her right, a huge
sealskin muff (or is it a tea-pot ‘cosy'), which she is on the
point of chucking at the head of someone who has been rude
to her. Lucky for him that he is not in the picture.
Herein J. E. BLANCHE has shown the subtlety of his art. He
has effaced himself at the critical moment.
Also by same clever artist, a bright portrait of MARIE
TEMPEST. Smiling, piquante. Not a Tempest at all, but a
light effect after a little storm in a saucer.
226. “Braving the Storm.” What a pity that Mr. GEORGE
H. Boughton, R.A., didn't hang this next to the Tempest'

THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE.
[“The members of the Leeds Physical Cul-
ture Society have entered upon a campaign
against all kinds of head coverings other than
those provided by nature, from the top-hat to
the Panama, and from the bowler to the cap.
At a meeting of the committee held last night
Mr. HARRY KREMNitz, an engineer by profession,
levelled a strong indictment against hats of all
kinds, charging them with being the cause of
baldness, grey hairs, and other evils. . . . . Mr.
KREMNitz has not worn a hat for nearly a
week, and several other gentlemen have pledged
themselves to go bareheaded when not in the
city.”—Daily Mail.]
MENACED by the threat of the No-hat
crusade initiated by the Leeds Physical
Culture Society, the captains of the
hat industry convened a great meeting
which was held in the Tête Gallery
last Saturday afternoon. The Mayor
of LUTON (where the straw hats come
from) presided, and amongst those on
the platform were the President of the
Republic of PANAMA, Sir TAM O'SHANTER,
Mr. HAROLD BUSBY, Mr. THOMAS Gibson-
BowlFR, M.P., Mr. ALFRED CAPPER, the
Caid of FEz, Sir MAGNUs GLENGARRY, and
Mr. Joseph HATTON.
The Mayor of LUTON in opening the
proceedings read several letters from
rominent representatives of the hat
industry and others who were unable
to be present. Count HATZFELDT wrote
from Schloss, Tarnhelm to express his
sympathy with the object of the meeting,
and Cardinal RAMPOLLA sent a telegram
from Rome to say that the Curia were
unanimous in opposing the new move-
ment. A hatless Cardinal was even more
unthinkable than a headless horseman.
A letter was also read from Mr. HoRACE
GoLDIN, the prestidigitateur, pointing out
that the abolition of the hat would mean
the abolition of the conjurer. (Shame.)
The Mayor then proceeded to explain
the motives which had led to the
summoning of the convention. They
were threatened, he said, with a crusade
which if it achieved its nefarious end,
would not only throw thousands of
industrious operatives out of employ-
ment, but expose the entire population
to an epidemic of sunstroke, catarrh, and
a host of cognate maladies. The sanity
of hatters had occasionally been
impugned, but their very existence
was based upon loyalty to the crown.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN (loud cheers), moreover,
had testified to the fascination of the
illimitable felt. It had been stated, the
Mayor continued, that if people went
about bareheaded their hair would grow
with the luxuriance of a pianist or a
tropical forest. But for his part he
would say that there were some heads
that were past all bearing. The motto
of the Leeds Physical Culture Society
might be, “Keep your hair on ”; the
motto of himself and the gentlemen
present would be, “Keep your hats on.”

Mr. HAROLD BUSBY, who followed, was
scornful upon balditude. Why, he
said, put this premium upon hirsute
adornment 2 For himself he would
rather be as bald as a new-laid egg than
have red hair.
[Interruption, during which three red-
headed men were forcibly ejected.
Resuming, Mr. BUSBy remarked that
many of the most illustrious men living
were bald. Look at Mr. P. F. WARNER,
for example. Look at Mr. WALTER LONG.
The Caid of FEZ, a swarthy gentle-
man suggesting more than a touch of the
tarboosh, was the next speaker. He
strongly denied that headgear led to
baldness. It required, he said, some-
thing more than a hatter—mad or
otherwise—to make hair march.
Mr. ABRAHAM LINoolN, who followed,
asked where would the War Office be if
headgear was abolished? The final
cause of its existence was to devise a
constant succession of new helmets,

forage caps, &c., which, apart from their testhetic value,
served as a perpetual red-herring to divert the attention ºf
the public from matters of graver moment. The nursemaids
of London, whom Mr. CHARLEs Booth estimated to number
upwards of 250,000, would certainly not tamely submit to
the indignity of being courted by bareheaded Guardsmen,
however curly.
Mr. J. Holt School.ING, on being provided with a black-
board, drew a series of striking diagrams succinctly visualis-
ing the displacement of labour which would inevitably be
brought about by the discarding of hats, caps, and bonnets.
Physiologically there could be little doubt that the result of ;
the change would be the arrest of baldness and the postpone-
ment of that failure of the pigment which led to grey hair.
There would therefore be more hair to cut, and he strongly
urged upon all those engaged in the hat trade, if they were
unable to check the new movement, to lose no time in
acquiring a mastery of the scissors and the comb.
ishop WELLDoN desired to associate himself, mutatis
mutandis, with the sentiments expressed in the telegram
from Cardinal RAMPOLLA. It might not always be judicious
to call a spade a spade, but it was impossible to call a
Bishop's hat anything but a shovel. - -
Mr. Joseph HATTON, the last speaker, urged the claims of
the theatre-goer. If head-gear, were abolished, how, he
asked, could ladies go to matinées 2 (Cheers.)
On everyone present pledging himself to wear his hat on
every possible occasion, and even to sleep in it if that could
be arranged, the meeting broke up.
our MR. JABBERJEE IN THE FAR EAST.

In furnished diggings, Seoul, Korea.
May 25, 1904. -
As you will perceive from the above superscription, I am
still an involuntary absentee from the arms of Bellona, being.
detained here on account of Sho-ji's health.
For I regret to report that my unfortunate saddlehack, so
far from becoming a convalescent, is now lower down than
ever on sick-list, and threatens to decline into the chronical
invalid, being thin as a threadpaper, with a very lofty
temperature, and frequent lapses into total deliriums.
During the entire night I have performed as a vigil by his
couch, applying iced fomentations to his fevered knob, in
ºn apprehensions that I was soon to receive his last
kick'
Being hard up as a broken stone, I can perceive no prospect
of affording myself any second mount that will be such a
perfect fit, and must probably put up with some cheap and
nasty substitute' -
Unless of course hon’ble Punch (who, according to illustra-
tions, is the somewhat accomplished equestrian on a splendid
cobhorse of phenomenally symmetrical spottishness) should
have sufficient fellow-feelings not to suffer his representative
to make a lamentable exhibition of himself by bestriding a
mere bone-bag!
It is not to be imagined that I can present myself to
Col. KHAKIMONo as the straddler of an ordinary ass, especially
as, in these localities, donkey-hire is even dearer than on the
yellow sands of the classiest English watering-places.
Under the above circs it cannot reasonably be expected
that I am to reveal any important Japanese military move-
ments—which besides are impenetrably masked behind the
fireproof curtain of official censorship.
I am excessively annoyed that the aforesaid Col. K. should
not have condescended to send me so much as a single
º postcard to inform me how he is getting on in my
ansence.
However, there may be some very good reason for such
abnormal secretiveness. For my Russian crony, Major
DRoschkyvitch, has been audibly chortling up his sleeves of late
on receipt of private intelligence direct from St. Petersburg,
to the effect that Russian squadrons have at last, sailed out
of Port Arthur, and mopped up most of hon’ble Admiral
Togo's finest fighting-junks. While simultaneously, it
seems, the garrison has sortied out on land-side, and com-
pelled no less than fifteen thousand Japanese advanced
guards to bite the dust before they could shake it off from
their shoes! - - -
I cannot profess any great surprise that they should have
been so severely snubbed, seeing that I have ab initio pre-
dicted some such unfortunate contretemps. For it is
undeniable that the Japanese have been too much addicted
to conversing through their headgear—and Pride is the
proverbial predecessor of some howling tumble!
Wherefore I have hastened to assure Major D. that I am a
sharer in his jubilations, being unable to wholly overcome
racial prejudices against allies, however civilised and up-to-
date, whose complexions are sicklied o'er with the pale cast
of French mustard.
I am also engaged in composition of a congratulatory ode
to Hon'ble KUROPATRIN, so ingeniously worded that, even
should the cat prove after all to have jumped in contrary
direction, my effusion can easily be altered so as to be fit as
a glove for Hon'ble KUROKI.
Meanwhile I am mixing myself in swaggering Korean
Societies. The other day I officiated as ; man for a
juvenile Korean bridegroom who was tying his neck in the
nuptial knot. As in Indian circles, the match was made up
by a professional family Astrologer—here termed a Pan-su-
and I can only trust that he may not turn out such an
incompetent old beetlehead as the Dowyboghee, who, too
sanguinely, predicted my own matrimonial felicity in two
successive wedlocks!
The Korean bridal procession was preceded by a bearer
carrying a live goosebird, as the emblem of connubial bliss
—which of course afforded me, at wedding-breakfast, the
opportunity for some rather facetious banterings.
It is de rigueur here for a bride to abstain from the least
loquacity, not only during the ceremonials, but for several
subsequent days—an immense improvement upon Hindoo
(and even Christian) etiquettes! .
My wedding-present consisted of an order on Punch Office
for a complete set of your instructive periodical from earliest
commencement. Kindly have these bound in best white
vellum, with appropriate gildings, and forward to my
Calcutta residence. Or, if that is to trouble you too far, send
cheque for estimated cost, and I will entrust the job to some
local bookbinder or other.
I have also taken a day off for caymen-hunting. The
cayman, as you are doubtless aware, is the mongrel offspring
of an Alligator and a Crocodile, and, by the inexorable law
of Heredity, exhibits the worst idiosyncrasies of both its
parents. It is best caught when about to sink into the lap
of Morpheus, being then oppressed with uncontrollable
gapes and yawnings, which make it as easy as a fall from a
log to swim up and surreptitiously insert a doubly-pointed
spike between its open jaws, after which, being unable to
close same, it rapidly fills with water till completely suffocated.
Being the comparative novice at such sports, I was
unfortunately unable to fill my bag with more than one
cayman, though said reptile luckily was of unprecedentedly
elongated proportions. It is now being stuffed up for a
trophy, and I should indubitably forward it per parcel post
for your kind acceptance, were it not far too bulky a curio to
figure as a knicknack even on “Punch" premises.
I am now to broach a business project which it is quite on
the cards that you may be inclined to mill. And yet, I will

not credit you with too little intelligence to have an optic for
so auriferous a mainchance. All human life is a lottery, and
you cannot expect that you are to pull out a plum if you will
not venture so much as a finger in the lucky-bag!
Now, while I cannot sufficiently deplore the unbridled
corruptitude of Korean officials, it were idle to deny that
their rottenness affords first-class facilities to any go-ahead
speculative who is desirous to make a bit.
I have already informed you of my intimacy with Lady
HM, who is sharp as an elderly needle and notoriously up to
every move on the Board of Trade. She has recently com-
municated to me the straight tip that a certain Moon-jiggi, or
Cabinet Wire-puller [Ed. É." Unless we are misinformed,
a “Moon-jiggi" is a gate-keeper] has a rather valuable mining
concession for sale, which, being the end of season, he is
ready to part with as the alarming sacrifice. Said mine is
situated in a central position, and contains chiefly coals,
which are guaranteed as infinitely superior to the very best
Welsh Wall-ends. These coals yield rich loads of copper,
and, who'd have thought it! such copper, on being analysed
by expert mining-chemists, has been found to be alloyed
with a still more precious metal—to wit, gold! of eighteen
carats quality!
Having obtained an interview with the above Moon-jiggi, I
am enabled to testify that the itching in his palm can be
healed with a very moderate expenditure of golden grease.
In short, he has undertaken to procure the Imperial signa-
ture to a concession of working rights over said mine for
999 years (which, I venture to predict, Sir, will see the pair
of us out!) for the sum down of yen 5000, and very very
moderate royalties.
Being of course too confirmed an impecunious to provide
even this paltry amount, I have decided to offer you the
opportunity to purchase a pig in the poke that is to
lay truly magnificent golden nest-eggs. I might no doubt
have applied to some wealthy native Indian capitalists, who
would assuredly have jumped at so shiny a bait—but my
filial affection for such a loving Parent as yourself impels me
to offer you first refusal.
You will have no trouble beyond furnishing supplies for
purchasing concession, and bribing Moon-jiggi (which latter
item will not, I should say, greatly exceed yen 500), I to
undertake all jobbery and to join Board after allotment. I
would also see that you are allotted several hundreds of
shares at mere peppercorn prices, which you might order
your Staff of Contributors to purchase from you at par,
thereby pocketing the pretty penny. As Chairman, I shall
be pleased to nominate you as one of my Directors—for,
though not (like too many Orientals) inclined to fulsome
flatteries, I am honestly of the opinion that you would make
a rather ornamental guinea-pig.
Well, what is the verdict, Honoured Sir? Am I to be
cabled a draft on some leading Calcutta Bank for yen 5500
(about £550) as the sprat to inveigle a handsome and golden
whale into your pccket-hole—or am I not? [ED. CoM.—You

M. BOUDIN IN ENGLAND.
No. IX.
“AHA, so this is Southampton”—it was Boudin who spoke,
and he pronounced it Sussungton, with the accent on the
first and third syllables, “This is that devil of Southampton
of which I hear so much. Come, my fine fellow, let us
embark and reach the yacht Petronel. I care not for the
earth any more; I despise him; I who speak to you, I will
perhaps dance a hornpipe. I will be Jack Tar, my friend,
iike you other English, who are all Jack Tars from your
birth. Oh, but the sea is not calm at all. You have deceive
me.”
By this time we were on the little motor-launch which was
to convey us to the Petromel, and in a few minutes more we
were on board that noble ship and had been welcomed by
our host, the rightest and tightest and most genial buccaneer
who ever sailed the British seas in luxury and a 400-ton
yacht. Shortly afterwards we sat down to lunch, and in the
meantime the anchor was weighed and away we steamed
towards Cherbourg, where we were to anchor for the night.
After lunch we went up on the bridge. Boupin's get-up,
I must admit, was faultless: his blue serge suit, his yachting-
cap with a white sun-cover, his white shoes with india-rubber
soles—everything about him, in fact, was le dernier cri in
nautical costume, and he was as proud as a child of his
appearance. There was no doubt about it, however: the sea
was rough and the Petronel soon began to pitch and toss in
the most approved style. Still we were all Britons, except
Boudin, and, whatever we feared, we were not going to show
our apprehensions—not just yet, at any rate. We were a
party of five, and we were all sitting very comfortably in
deck chairs and smoking various forms of tobacco, Boudin
having ventured on a very big cigar.
“Are you a good sailor, Boudn?” said I.
“Ah, as to that, I know not,” he replied, “I have served
my one year as a soldier, and as I do not want to serve any
more at all I suppose that I am not a good soldier; but I
have not been in the inscription maritime, so I have not
given my proofs as a sailor, but I will learn—not so well as
you English, of course, for you are born for a life on the
sea, but as well as I can I will learn what a sailor must
know.”
“I don't mean that kind of thing, Boudin. I mean are
you ever sea-sick?”
“Ah, my poor friend”—(when a Frenchman is filled with
pity for himself he always calls you his poor friend)—“Ah,
my poor friend, do not speak of it. I did survive from Calais
to Dover when I begin my visit in England, but that is my
only voyage on the sea. I fear, yes, I fear very much I shall
be sea-sick, for I am a Frenchman, and the Latin races are
no good for the sea. It is only the Anglo-Saxon who is
always a jolly fellow when the waves are like mountains,”
and he blew out a great cloud of cigar smoke which seemed
to be particularly strong and offensive. “Oh, but never
mind,” he continued, “you will be kind to your little Boudin.
When he agonises with the mal de mer you will help him to
make his testament, and you will sing “Rule Britannia’ to
him till he render his last sigh.”
At this point two members of our party, who had thrown
away their cigarettes some minutes ago, and had become
very pensive and silent, said they thought they would go
below and see about unpacking their things. Our deck-
party was thus reduced to three—our host, Boudin and
myself.
“Those poor fellows,” said Boudin, meditatively. “Why
have they so yellow an air? But perhaps they go below

What was that one I hear mademoiselle your sister sing to
us last week? Something about
When we jolly sailor-boys are scudding up aloft,
And the landlubbers lying down below, below, below,
And the landlubbers lying down below.
That was the song. Ah, you will not sing him. You get
up. You are offended with Boudin. He have put his foot

I furiously envy to be a sailor like you English. Ah, you

He had made friends with the captain, a Scotchman, who
described him as “a verra nice gentleman, but a wee wild in
his talk.” I quite agree.
AESTHETIC MORALS.
[Wide an article in Harper's Magazine on “AEsthetics of the Sky."]
It is all very well for a poet to tell
Of the lessons that lurk in the skies,
And to bid you cry halt and regard the blue vault
With a pair of poetical eyes:
In the country one may with propriety stray,
With one's gaze fixed intent on a cloud,
And watch its shape change—but it's apt to seem strange
If one does the same thing in a crowd.
. I am told it's correct, would you catch the effect
Of a sky as it ought to be caught,
To be bent till your feet and your head nearly meet,
And to gaze through your legs lost in thought.
In a green Surrey lane or on Salisbury Plain
There is no one to laugh at your fad;
But to play such a prank at St. Paul's or the Bank
Would undoubtedly stamp you as mad.
Common people would think you were given to drink,
And the cabbies would scarce understand
That the thought in your heart was devotion to art
If they saw you stuck fast in the Strand;
The busmen would laugh and deride you with chaff,
And, instead of respecting your soul,
They would catch you a whack in the small of your back
With the end of the omnibus pole.

Vecsey. It is Professor METCHNIKOFF's
recent lecture on old age and its cure
that has brought us together. As you
are doubtless aware, old age is merely a
disease, like tennis elbow or anything
else, and all that is needed to remove it
is the discovery of an elixir vitae. We
are met to debate whether a graceful
old age is preferable to perpetual youth.
Glancing round I see several perpetual
youths in our midst.
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. Very prettily
ut.
Mr. Swinburne. A delicate and dis-
cerning compliment.
Vecsey. Some of us are indeed very
young. Shall we get older or not?
Several Harmsworths. Never. To grow
old is a confession of failure.
Mr. Winston Churchill... All the harm
in the world is done by the old. Youth
divines; age merely knows. Youth
soars upon intuitions; age crawls among
facts. There will never be anything old
about me.
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. Except ham.
Mr. Winston Churchill. Eh 2
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. Except ham.
Mr. Winston Churchill. I fail to

Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. You will
see it soon, when you are a little older.
Vecsey. It is, I think, my duty as
Chairman to point out that Professor
METCHNIKOFF does not promise a per-
tual youthfulness of mind, but of
ody. Our minds will grow old, I take
it, as heretofore; but our bodies will
continue young.
Several Harmsworths. That is rather
serious. Do you mean that we shall in
time become more than twenty-one
years of age, just as if Professor METCH-
NiKOFF had never existed ?
Vecsey. Certainly.
Several Harmsworths. We don't like
that at all. It is impossible to say
what would happen to the Daily Mail
if we were to get old.

Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. Mottoes
often get out of date. My motto, in
1884 was “Free Trade for England.”
Dr. Deighton. Our Chairman is quite
right. It is absurd to talk about age
as if it were a matter of years. It is a
matter of feeling—a man is as old as
he feels. No one is old who can walk
as I did from Land's End to John o'
Groats.
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. Years are
nothing. Look at me. I am univer-
sally acknowledged to be the youngest
Member in the House.
Mr. William Younger. I beg the
Right Honourable gentleman's pardon,
but I am YouNGER.
Señor Manuel Garcia. Speaking as
one whose hundredth birthday is immi-
nent I may say that age is easily kept
at bay. One simply has to teach sing-
ing. I am explaining the system in my
Manuel for Centenarians, now in the
press.
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. Do you really
think that teaching singing is as effec-
tive as a feverish political activity?
Señor Garcia. Certainly.
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. I must look
into the matter. I may be in need of a
change of occupation in a few months'
time. Since there was a Corn Law
Rhymer, why not a Tariff Troubadour *
Mr. Swinburne. Señor GARCIA's age
reminds me of a riddle which the Great
Panjandrum of Criticism, my friend
Vecsey. Are we to try to guess it, or
will you enjoy the triumph of supplying
the answer?
Señor Garcia. Or shall we change the
subject? I remember when I crossed
to America in 1825––
Mr. Swinburne. The answer is quite
simple—Because it's a sent-in-error 'un.
Mr. Austen Chamberlain. Speaking as
the Chancellor of the Exchequer I must
strongly protest against the anarchical
views of Professor METCHNIKoff. Sup-
posing he found his elixir vitae, where
would the Death Duties be?
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. That would
be all right, my son; we could put a tax
on living.
Vecsey. I think it is clear from what
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN has said that the
menace of perpetual youth is not likely
to be serious. A graduated income-tax,
rising to five shillings in the pound for
persons above eighty, will surely prevent
most people from indulging in Professor
METCHNikoff's insidious drug.
Mr. Swinburne. “Songs by a Septua-
genarian swimmer” has an agreeable
assonance, or “Octogenarian Occ. verse.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, June 13.
—Mystery has ever brooded over the
reasons why GRAHAM MURRAY exchanged
the Lord Advocateship for the post of
Secretary for Scotland. It is true the
latter is the higher rank, carrying with
it a seat in the Cabinet. But the differ-
ence in the salary is grievous. He had
not been Secretary five minutes when
bang went £3000 a year. To any of us
that would be a serious consideration.
To a Scotchman it is sheer anguish.
Those who know GRAHAM MuRRAY, who
are familiar with his chivalrous nature,
hold proof of his loyalty, understand the
matter quite clearly. In October of last
year PRINCE ARTHUR was in a fix that
froze the smile on even his countenance.
The Ministry was breaking up; vacancies
included the Scotch office, most difficult
to fill. GRAHAM MURRAY was the only man
available. Would he sacrifice £3000
a year on the altar of friendship and
fealty? He did, earning a fresh claim
on the gratitude of his Party and the
esteem of mankind only partially acknow-
ledged.
That is explanation enough for the
ordinary man. The MEMBER FOR SARK,
nothing if not penetrating, has discovered
another reason. Whilst GRAHAM MURRAY
was still Lord Advocate Mr. CALDwell
fastened upon him with a tenacity that
makes the habits of the octopus by com-
parison feeble. For the more convenient
pursuit of his purpose “JIMMY,” as
Scotch Members in vain effort to make
light of him say, selected a seat just
behind the Front Opposition Bench,
“Loud-voiced, emphatic, voluble. No pause,
no semi-colon, not even a comma.”
(Mr. C-ldw-ll.)
“C.-B. At The RACEs.”
Gipsy. “Tell your fortune, pretty gentleman?”
C.-B. “Heavens, no, my good woman!
immediately facing the hapless Lord
Advocate. Standing there, with his
pockets crammed with pirated editions
of music-hall songs, JIMMY could with
ease and accuracy wag his forefinger at
the right hon. gentleman.
Through eight long years he has done
this. Session after session, in winter
months or beneath the severity of June
skies, the Lord Advocate has “sat under”
Mr. CALDWELL. Time came to him when
desire failed, when the grasshopper
became a burden. PRINCE ARTHUR hint-
ing at the vacancy in the post of Minister
for Scotland, all that GRAHAM MURRAY saw
through blurred eyes was deliverance
from the Lord Advocate's responsibilities,
which, in their Parliamentary form, were
largely composed of being talked at
by Mr. CALDwell to the interminable,
threatening, scolding, commanding, in-
structing, depressing, wagging of an
insistent forefinger.
If there be any truth in this reading
of circumstance GRAHAM MURRAY has
been doubly done. He has lost his
£3000 a year, and Mr. CALDwell still
pursues him.
These are, indeed, great times for
JIMMY. When, bent on healthful week-
ending, I left the House on Friday after-
noon, June 10, he was on his legs,
talking about musical copyright to an
Anything but that!!”
and benches. Returning this, Monday,
afternoon, behold ! JIMMY is still on his
legs, wagging his forefinger with pre-
cisely the same manner, roaring forth
words at the rate of sixteen to a
dozen. But—and this gives fresh glow
to his manner, adds three-quarters of
an hour to the length of successive
speeches—there on the Treasury Bench
sits the shadow of a former Lord Advo-
cate, now Secretary of State for Scotland.
Not having anything to do with the
Musical Copyright Bill (no sane man
would pirate music written for the
bagpipes), GRAHAM MURRAY on Friday
for once escaped the toils of Jimmy.
To-day Scotch Education Bill is in
Committee. ... It is in charge of the
Minister for Scotland, and JIMMY, remem-
bering the drawback to his prolonged
delight of Friday afternoon, when he
made fifteen speeches and talked out
the Musical Copyright Bill, makes most
of opportunity.
The Ancient Mariner was merely in-
terjectional in his remarks compared
with JIMMY almost within buttonhole-
reach of the ex-Lord Advocate.

brought up to the calico-printing busi-
ness, is a mariner only in the sense
that he ever floats on a sea of words.
These are details. On he went, jubilant,
loud-voiced, emphatic, voluble. No
pause, no semi-colon, not even a comma.
And all the while his glittering eye
fixed on the shrunken form of the
suffering Secretary for Scotland.

Regret to say GRAHAM MURRAY's finely
mettled, long - trained patience, tem-
rarily broke down under strain. Mr.
ALDwell having been on for a couple
of hours, C.-B. chancing to look in
made, sotto voce, remark on something
the Secretary was saying about the
system of Royal and Police Burghs in
Scotland.

boy on the outskirts of the crowd, and
triumphantly marches him off to durance
vile. So this afternoon the Secretary
for Scotland and C.-B. The latter ab-
solutely void of offence. Except possibly
in the case of Lord RoseBERY, ever ready,
even anxious, to efface himself. On him
the Secretary, his soul seared with Mr.
CALDwell's vocal pertinacity, turned
with something between a sneer and a
snarl.
“ Unlike the right hon. gentleman,”
i. said, “I was not at the Races yester-
y.
The retort, it will be observed, lacks
the finish of appositeness. The topic
immediately under discussion was the
pride of port of Scotch Royal Burghs
who would never consent to be repre-
sented by mere modern County Councils.
Where Ascot comes in, with C.-B. on
the Grand Stand, is not at first sight
apparent.
Apart from that there is something
hopelessly incongruous in the idea of
C.-B. in a white hat with a green silk
It's not 'alf so bad as you expected, is it, now; and the others will all be
veil, a field glass slung about his shoul-
ders, totting up the odds in his book.
Could have occurred only to imagina-
tion heated by extreme vexation. The
charge is one peculiarly calculated to
damage a political adversary. The idea
of the right hon. Member for the Stirling
District going off to Ascot when he had
at hand the alternative joy of sitting
through a June afternoon discussing a
Scotch Education Bill, is difficult for a
kirk elder to realise. But it is so
obviously improper that resentment
would be deeply stirred.
C.-B., perceiving the gravity of the
situation, made haste to deny the im-
peachment.
“I was not at the Races,” he said.
“The right hon. gentleman,” retorted
the Secretary, “did not come into the
House until the last race was over.”
Here is fresh, increasingly disastrous,
proof of the effect upon a powerful
mind, of being talked at through two
days by Mr. CALDwell. Long trained in
the laws of evidence, in succession

Advocate-Depute, Sheriff of Perthshire, Solicitor-General for
Scotland, and Lord Advocate, GRAHAM MURRAY would instinct-
ively decline to receive as evidence “what the soldier said.”
Yet, having brought a baseless charge against the moral
character of a distinguished statesman, he unblushingly
attempted to support, it by the syllogism that C.-B., having
reached his place on the Front Opposition bench at an hour
synchronising with the last race at Ascot, argal, he had been
to the Races.
Cream of the joke may perhaps be spooned from the fact
that racing at Ascot did not commence till to-day.

FRAMES OF MIND.
[“I declare that the above statement contains a full, just and true
account and return of the whole of my income from every source what-
soerer for the year ending the 5th day of April, 1905.”—Extract from
Income Taz Return form.]
O MR. SURVEYor of Taxes,
A terrible task you impose!
I claim some abatement: you ask for a statement
Of details which nobody knows.
My revenue wanes and it waxes
Along with my varying mood;
It's mainly a question, I think, of digestion,
And largely depends upon food.
Then how fill up the form 2
My income how foretell?
How know what cheer the coming year
Is bringing near, with smile or tear?
O, will my hearth be warm,
My table furnished well?
Or will my fare be sordid care,
Another weary spell?
When late at the Carlton I tarry,
Where riches and luxury reign,
When I sup con amore and trail clouds of glory
Inspired by the best of champagne,
I am then a great playwright—a BARRIE–
Three plays at a time on the boards—
The royalties pour in and put more and more in
My purse till it's fat as a lord's.
When Economy raises her finger
And bids me reluctantly go
To dine for a florin in haunts that are forei
And doubtful in dingy Soho, -
Fair visions no longer will linger,
The future begins to look black;
I see myself earning with toil and heart-burning
The wage of a newspaper hack.
When, growing more prudent than ever,
On messes of pottage I sup,
Or dine somewhat sparsely on cutlets of parsley,
And drink Adam's ale from my cup;
When I struggle with frugal endeavour
By “diet” to keep down the bill,
When I feel filled-and-emptied, I'm very much tempted
To send in my income as nil.
Then how fill up the form?
My income how foretell?
How know what cheer the coming year
Is bringing near, with smile or tear?
O, will my hearth be warm,
My table furnished well?
Or will my fare be sordid care,
Another weary spell?
A SUNDAY SCHOOL OF ACTING.
It is never too late to say a good word during any season
for first-rate acting, and this word of praise all round must
be given to the sterling actors who, shoulder to shoulder,
have carried along triumphantly during the season Mr.
“T. RACEwARD's" very interesting, but in some respects
faulty, and not strikingly original, play of Sunday
at the Comedy Theatre. The four jolly colonial sandboys
who form a quartette of guardians around the sweet orphan
girl Miss Sunday are clearly reminiscent of the jovial
Bohemian artists who kept watch o'er the life of poor Trilby,
as they themselves, by the way, were with equal certainty
reminiscent of MüRGER's happy-go-lucky Bohemians of Paris.
But into this matter it is not now worth while to enter, as
this comedy has made its mark, and will make its very many
marks, in good English coin, before its present proprietors,
Mr. and Mrs. FRED TERRY, have done with it. Certainly, as
far as acting goes, they are doing uncommonly well with it.
Taken all round it is a perfect cast, the only artist in the
company who is not “fitted down to the ground" is the self-
denying Manager; and yet without him, the play, with
Mrs. FRED TERRY (JULIA NEILsoN) in it, would have lacked its
strongest complement. “Which,” as the ancient Sairey
might have said, “spelling ‘complement' with an ‘i,’” is a
tribute that may be most iſ: paid to the Colonel Brin-
thorpe of Mr. FRED TERRY.
Miss JULIA NEILson is what “the boys” in the hut call
her, “a dream.” The laugh that is born of her sheer light-
ness of heart, and not of head, is delightfully fresh ; and yet
there is danger in it, artistically, a tempting danger: it may
be so very easily overdone, and should it once sound strained,
there is an end of the ingenuousness of this fascinating
character. The part abounds in opportunities, not one of
which Miss Neilson loses. Her comedy is infectious, her
tragedy overwhelms us. It is a thoroughly good performance.
As the unprincipled Arthur Brinthorpe, a most difficult
part to play, Mr. MALcol M. CHERRY acquits himself admirably.
The character is a double-dyed scoundrel of the most ordi-
nary type of gay Lothario known to the stage, and yet is
Mr. Cherry's performance of it absolutely free from all con-
ventionality. When first he is introduced he is above
suspicion, and though lookers-on see most of the game, the
audience is almost as much astonished as is Sunday herself
to find what a scoundrel has been entertained unawares by
the simple, rough and ready brotherhood of the Creek.
Admirable in his solid line is Mr. J. D. BEVERIDGE as
everybody's friend, Tom Oatley, and this must be said equally
of the fine performance of Mr. Louis CALVERT as the rough
and ready Towzer, of the striking characterisation by -
ALFRED BRYDONE of Davy, and of the eccentric comedy tone
given, with so delicately humorous a touch, by Mr. ALFRED
KENDRick to the kindly but feeble Jacky.
Calm, dignified, and sympathetic is Miss EDYTH Olive as
A Nun, who having touched all hearts, disappears after the
First Act, leaving not even her name, as it is not given in the
rogramme. She is one of those “who come like shadows, so
epart.’
K. finally Miss BELLA PATEMAN, looking like a superb
Marquise de la vieille roche, yet acting just as the homely,
gracious, and soft-hearted Mrs. Naresby would have done in
real life, completes a singularly effective list of dramatis
persona. At what date Miss JULIA NEilson and Mr. FRED
TERRY are to take “their Sunday out” (of the bill) is not men-
tioned, but no one who appreciates thoroughly good acting
#. lose the chance of seeing this play at the Comedy
heatre.

Wednesday, June 15.-Our Operatic Syndicate is rich in
tenors, and as there's not a false note among them, that is,
not one that has been detected up to the present time, they
can change them at will. This they have already done, but
to-night no change is given, and La Traviata, being played
with the best of all possible casts as announced, draws an
overflowing house. Madame MELBA, singing perfectly and
doing her very best with the character of the consumptive
Violetta (how deceitful are appearances!), is acclaimed enthu-
siastically. Clever of MELBA to indicate how Violetta can not
be morally responsible for her conduct by showing how,
while all her lady and gentlemen friends, forming the dis-
tinguished and sympathetic chorus, are in the attire that
characterised the period of the second CHARLEs, our sweet
Violetta, inspired by a sort of prophetic eccentricity, adopts
present-day costume with a very much up-to-date hat peculiar
to this year of grace and elegance. This is distinctly and
subtly artistic, as a toque would have too markedly empha-
sised the fact of her being un peu togué. But what if the
chorus and all the dramatis personae are wrong and Violetta
MELBA alone is right? This is not improbable, as the action
of the original novel was placed in “the so-called nineteenth
century.” So, after all, Violetta is nearer the truth than
her surroundings. Signor CARUso is too robusto for the
mawkishly sentimental Alfredo, but he was in splendid voice
and in a remarkably funny costume: grief had evidently
affected his taste and judgment in the matter of clothes.
No matter, all were excellent, especially clever Signor Scotti
(in this, A-Scotti time of racing) as Alfredo's preternaturally
serious papa (with a past—ahem'), known to his familiars as
Old Georgey|Germont. The mise-en-scène perfect, especially
the Garden Scene: but all the Covent Garden scenes are
noteworthy. A new decor has just been added, as on Dr.
HANs RICHTER has just been conferred the Royal Victorian
Order by His Gracious Music-loving Majesty, King Edward.
This gives HANS RICHTER free entrance to all theatres and
opera houses, as he can go where he likes with this Order,
which is, of course, a passe-partout.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
THE reader taking up Garmiscath (BLAckwood) and
observing it is written by J. STORER CLouston, will naturally
expect to find echoes of the riotous fun that bubbled round
the career of The Lunatic at Large. Mr. Clouston, however,
establishes his versatility, the two books being wide asunder
as sanity and madness. New ground is broken by placin
the scene in far-off Orkney. It has evidently been sketche
on the spot, and affords material for some excellent descrip-
tions of an inconstant heaven bent over a land bounded by
unrestful waters. There is a fine study of a sturdy Scot
who lends his name to the book. In contrast with him is
the immigrant Southron, whose ancestors, by wiles and wealth,
possessed themselves of Garmiscath's land. To tell how it
is redeemed through the agency of the Odaller's son is the
purpose of a story of sustained interest. My Baronite finds
something a little mechanical in the part played in the drama
by Captain Maitland and his family. But the rugged
character of the old Islander suffices.
My Nautical Retainer desires to commend The Court of
Sacharissa (HEINEMANN), by HUGH SHERINGHAM and NEvili,
MEAKIN. It is the tale of a Company of Gentlemen Adven-
turers who have the pleasant habit of exploring the Home
Counties on Saturday afternoons. Trespassing one day upon
a fair pleasaunce they encounter its charming châtelaine,
who enters at once into the spirit that animates their society,
and gives them entertainment on seven successive excursions.
No actual names occur in the book; but each of the Adven-
turers has a fanciful title—“The Ambassador,” “The Exotic,”
“The Man of Truth,” and so forth—with which his character
and conversation accord. From time to time their mutual
badinage is relieved by stories told in the right Boccaccian
manner, in which form of entertainment “The Exotic” bears
the palm, his tales being appropriately coloured with
Oriental diction and sentiment. The presence of Sacharissa,
as an audience, is at once an inspiring force and a restraint
upon excessive ebullience. She shows a very perfect tact in
drawing out their respective gifts; and it is a tribute to her
impartiality that they should all want to marry her in the
penultimate scene. My Nautical Retainer, while honour-
ably refusing to betray the secret of her choice, considers
that in this rather important matter the authors have done
an injustice to her good taste.
If some of the details of the
book may seem a little otiose,
this is all part of the natural
garrulity proper to this kind
of work. The authors have
not attempted the literary
finesse, sometimes too conscious,
of STEVENSON's New Arabian
Nights, or Mr. Hewlett's New Can-
terbury Tales; but in their own
easy and unaffected style they
have contrived to give an irre-
sistible attraction to these Am-
brosial. Afternoons.

“Who is this Alcestis who lives at Bradford?” inquired
SYLVIA, as she turned over the leaves of my engagement-

“It's BRADFIELD,” I said, “and it's a woman, not a man.

“Yes,” said SYLVIA expectantly, “a woman?”
“And she was married to a man—a king”—(SYLVIA looked
pleased)—“who was very ill and didn't want to die »).
“She must have been a nice woman!” interposed SYLVIA.

“Don't interrupt, SYLVIA!” I .# severely. “As I was

Alcestis had had some very nice times together before she
married that hateful king-man'."
“Not at all!” I said firmly. “In fact it was only for the
king's sake—he was his special friend — that Herakles
fought with Death at all and won back Alcestis. And so
the king's sorrow was turned into great and unexpected
joy!” I concluded.
SYLVIA looked at me witheringly.
“Of course,” she said, “the man who wrote the story”
(“EURIPIDES was his name, and it was a play, not a story,
SYLVIA!” I murmured) “had to say that Alcestis and
Herakles didn't know each other. I expect everyone knew
who he meant—people always do guess the real names in
novels, don't they?—and it wouldn't have done, but of course
she'd thrown over that nice Herakles for that hateful king—
no, I don’t want to know his name—and it was splendid of
him to fight with Death for her after she'd been so horrid.

[Mr. J. REDMond asked the Prime Minister if he intended to “take
any steps to prevent the House from being permanently, reduced to
impotence” by the blocking, motions of “obscure individuals." Mr.
BALFour replied that it was “impossible to ask one side to correct its
way of going on unless there was a clear understanding that the other
side would follow a similar process of self-abnegation.” He had given
no pledge to reform this state of things, but he had promised to re-
model ;. procedure connected with the adjournment for the holidays.]
THEY meet, they cackle, they orate,
They bandy jargon, lip for lip,
With shifty tools of sham debate
They hew each other thigh and hip;
It is Des mots! des mots! des mots!
As glorious SARAH says in Hamlet,
But for the net results they show
I wouldn't give a paltry damlet.
This side and that Obstruction sits
Alternatively, like a rock,
Breaking the turgid flow of wits
With counter-blasts of “Gag!” and “Block!”
One cries—“The ship of State's at sea,
You bar her way with reefs of granite!”
And gets for instant repartee—
“I know we do, but you began it!”
Big with Napoleonic airs
And beri-beri on the brain,
See REDMOND (J.) conduct affairs
In lofty tones of cool disdain,
Saying, “I ask you, is it just
That individuals should smother
The sacred Truth with obscure dust?”
And Someone answers, “You're Another!”
So the old farce contrives to run,
To what good purpose Heaven knows;
Nothing attempted, nothing done
Earns them an honest night's repose;
Until their power of abstract thought,
Their strenuous will, their fine discernment,
Latent till now at last are brought
To bear upon—the next adjournment'

My soul has been embittered by
Envy of that exalted sphere
Almost impinging on the sky—
But I have thought, and dare to say,
That we might still escape perdition,
Although the House kept holiday
With never a moment's intermission.
During the short half-year or so
In which it now recruits its nerves,
The planets somehow seem to go
Along their customary curves;
The i. revolves, and even Town
(Most nearly touched by that estrangement)
Pursues its courses up and down,
Nor suffers any marked derangement.
And, could we safely leave supplies
To AUSTEN's judgment, I confess
I'd like a Bill to legalise
A sort of permanent Recess;
I know of none among them all,
Even the Code of Education,
More calculated to enthrall
The popular imagination' O. S.
PILGRIMS AND THEIR PROGRESS.
SoME ten days or so ago, the Pilgrims gave their Second
Annual Dinner to Field-Marshal Earl Roberts, and while
entertaining a few selected friends were themselves enter-
tained with some excellent speeches delivered by his Excellency
the American Ambassador, who was at his very best, as, of
course, was everybody on such a generally confraternal
occasion.
The Darling of the Bench, not “of the Gods” at His
Majesty's, delivered himself of some light sentences, and,
casting a sly glance at the Bell of Printing House Square,
expressed his unbounded pleasure at the prospect of soon
being able to purchase the entire Times at the price of a
single journey per Tuppenny Tube.
. GEORGE £ºw. e a wonderful wandering speech,
strongly advocating the use of the word “However,” and
however he managed to repeat, with emphasis and discretion,
some twenty lines of somebody else's poetry, was to all a marvel
and a great delight. “However” he did it, and how every
one enjoyed it, it is needless to record. Amid cheers,
however, he sat down.
The sprightly Secretary, Mr. HARRY E. W. BRITTAIN–name
of best omen at an Anglo-American banquet—read a number
of congratulatory telegrams fresh from the States, which
were received with heartiest applause and chorus of “So say
all of U.S.,” and soon afterwards these Pilgrims of Progress
became peripatetic philosophers, and sought their various
temporary abiding places.
FRIENDS IN FRONT.
It is satisfactory to record the complete success of the
CLEMENT SCOTT Matinée at His Majesty's, to which so many
kind-hearted actors and actresses contributed some of their
very best work. CHARLES WARNER was excellent. LILIAN
BRAITHWAITE and GEORGE ALEXANDER, wonderfully made up,
playing to perfection (which is a very high compliment to
their audience), made a great hit in a short piece that ought
to have a long run. Piquante MARIE TEMPEST sang charm-
ingly; and Little GEORGIE GROSSMITH was immense. “Gee-
Gee's" cinematograph is a most up-to-date hit, to be reckoned
as among his very happiest efforts. MALCOLM WATson's
burglarious effort, illustrated by ARTHUR BourCHIER, is not
equal to Mr. BROOKFIELD's Burglar and Judge.
If it can ever be true that §. is too little of a fine woman,
then, on this occasion, it might be fairly said of JULIA
NEILSON, who came, sang, conquered, and vanished. Miss
ADA REEVE, with two songs, was at her happiest. Mr. TREE
and company revived our old friend Herod; and Madame
RÉJANE's imitations were most amusing.
But the great hit of the afternoon's entertainment, the one
thing that roused the house to an almost unexampled pitch
of excitement, was the reappearance of Sir HENRY IRVING, for
this occasion only, in the part of Corporal Gregory Brewster,
which he plays as no one else can, or ever will. Such an
enthusiastic greeting must have very nearly overcome even
so hardy a veteran as IRVING's Corporal Brewster. His per-
formance was perfection.
Alas! . Poor CLEMENT Scott was not to enjoy for long the
fruit of his friends' affection. Since the above lines were
written, and just as we go to press, we learn, to our yery deep
sorrow, the sad news of his death.
From the Daventry Express:-"To pooh-pooh the idea of
this country ever being invaded is to follow the example of
the camel, which buries its head in the sand when an enemy
approaches.” Surely the author of this apophthegm must
have meant to refer to the ostrich, which, in these circum-
stances, has a habit of putting his eye through a needle.

OUR MR. JABBERJEE IN THE FAR EAST.
XI.
In same furnished diggings, at Seoul, Korea.
As a notorious epicure of horseflesh, you will, Respectable
Sir, be overjoyed by the intelligence that my poor dilapidated
crock, Sho-ji, is at last on the high road to be completely
mended, though still, owing to protracted brainfeverishness,
as weak as gingerbread, and reduced to the status of a
confirmed soporific'
This will, perhaps, explain why I was unable—to the
inexpressible disappointment both of Col. KHAKIMONO and
self—to put in any appearance at the Battle of Kin-chau,
which (according to Japanese authorities) resulted in a rather
overwhelming Russian defeat.
But there is no medal which has not some reverse or other,
and it is advisable to audi alteram partem before constructing
a glorious Summer out of a solitary Swallow; since I am
assured by Major DROSCHKYWITCH that the said Kin-chau affair
was a simple demonstration of no strategical importance, and
that, even if it is true that Russia has lost seventy-eight
artillery pieces, this was merely the good riddance of bad
Chinese rubbishes which would infallibly have impedimented
any forward movements. Also that Hon'ble KUROPATKIN is
relentless in his determination on no account to commence
hostilities in serious earnestness until the period of the
Russian Kalends.
From which it follows that all so-called Japanese victories
prior to said date can have no real significance. I do not
know whether Hon’ble KUROKI has been duly informed of
this, or whether he is still a resident at No. 1, Fools'
Paradise!
But since it is a sickish wind that cannot wheeze hot and
cold simultaneously, I am profiting by the delay to acquire
greater familiarities in the customs and manners of Quaint
Korea, as I am now to demonstrate. [ED. CoM.—Which, we
fear, means that Mr. J. has contrived to procure some more
works on Korea from his circulating library at Calcutta.]
I was recently the delighted recipient of a politely-worded
invite-card desiring the honour of my company at a
“Poetry Party”—a form of social entertainment which I may
perhaps best describe as a Feast out of all reason for flowing
souls, since those bidden must, after over-eating themselves
beyond the verge of repletion, go in for a competition-exam.
as to who shall produce the finest original piece of poetry.
In smart Korean societies it is bon ton not to dress—but
per contram to undress—for dinner, as is also customary (to
at all events a partial extent) amongst upper-ten English
feminines, though, in the latter case, such décolleté garbages
cannot be dictated by gluttonous propensities, seeing that
the stomachs of European fair sexes are too constricted by
tight-lace for even a moderate blow-out.
Such is, however, admittedly the object of disrobings by
Korean dandies, who regard it as the acme of elegant
gentility for guests to gorge until within an ace of bursting.
Being myself of very so-so carnivorousness, I was literally
flabbergasted to behold the voracity with which the Korean
literary swell-mob did bolt incredible quantities of boiled pork
with rice wine, maccaronic soup, chickens with millet wine,
fowl-eggs, pastries, potatoes, lilybulbs, seaweeds, roast rice,
and sesame and honey puddings, as preparatories for receiv-
ing the divine afflatus!
After which writing materials were handed round—as in
the post-prandial recreations of my former select fellow
boarders at Porticobello House, Ladbroke Hill—and each
individual was expected, however torpid, to compose some
poetical effusion upon any topic he preferred.
As a gallant, I was about to select for my theme the
pulchritude of an imaginary Geisha—but was informed that
this was ultra vires as, in Korea, no female woman is
accounted a deserving object for a sonnet.
And I am compelled to admit that, hitherto, I have not
had the good luck to encounter any Korean feminine who
was not abnormally plain-headed.
Qur Amphictryon, a certain highly-accomplished Yang-ban
of the name of Hi-FA-Loo-TING, who had rendered himself so
gloriously tight by dint of rice-champagne that he was the
admiration of all present, did hiccough out a rather ludicrous
ode to a Bamboo, of which I append verbatim translation:-
TO HON’BLE BAMBOO-PLANT |
“O grass with knotty joints like green shanks of a gouty grasshopper,
What a * of useful ić. and i...ºf .# thou P.
supply
Thou providest first-class pipes for Company's waterworks,
Also cheap furnitures for interior of bungalow.
In the form of canes, thou upholdest the steps of toddling seniles,
Or . literae humaniores on haunches of juvenile students!
Excellent art thou when boiled in milk after the fashion of asparagus,
And, preserved in vinegar, thou makest a pre-eminently pretty pickle.
Thou containest sugar and honey, both of highly superior qualities.
But—best of all—beer can be brewed from §. on which it is possible
to become excessively intoxicated
Glug-glug-glug' ... Will somebody kindly pass me the bottle?”
I cannot conscientiously say that the above composition,
though creditable enough as the work of an inebriate, is at
all up to the standard of an English Poet-Laureate. How-
ever, it was indubitably a masterspiece compared with the
effusions of the other Yang-bans—a very unimaginative
prosaic lot of chaps'
When it came to my own turn, I rendered into English
verse a beautifully pathetic Korean anecdote recording a
phenomenal act offilial devotion. Enclosed please find:—
THE DUTIFUL SON.
“Persistent flies did gamble unappalled
Upon parental cranium—which was bald.
In vain the Aged Parent smacks his knob,
No flies he flattens to a formless blob
This his Son notes; his feeling heart goes sore
At shocking sufferings of Progenitor.
Can filial love no stratagem devise
To clear that venerable head of flies?
He shouts ‘Eureka!’ also “Hip, hussar!”
As he perceives some honey in a jar.
And, trusting sweet-stuff is to do the trick,
On his devoted pate he spreads it thick,
Then squats expectant at his Father's side,
Subduing simpers which he scarce can hide ...
The flies desert the Sire's jejune ca-pºt,
Finding his Son's the more alluring nut,
Who smirks sublime—while insects all round him buzz—
Circling his saintish noddle like a nimbus!”
This eloquent impromptu, which I recited vivá voce, evoked
unparagoned enthusiasm amongst the assembled Korean
literary big-pots, who, hurling up their horse-hair chimney-
tiles to the welkin, unanimously demanded that I was to be
awarded first prize.
And—a still more gratifying circ—when, through the
kind officiousness of Lady HM, a copy of the above poetical
effusion was presented to the EMPEROR, his Majesty was so
inordinately tickled by same that he has conferred upon my
undeserving self the Third Class Order of the Rosy Rabbit !
Unfortunately, before I can be permitted to sport this
decoration on bosom, it is a sine quá non to shell out to
Court Officials sundry fees, amounting in all to (about)
yen 300.
Since any distinction bestowed on myself must inevitably
be the good stroke of business for Hon’ble Punch, you will
please attend to this matter without delay.
Or, if you will kindly remit me yen 600, it is just on the
cards that I may be able to obtain a Fourth Class Rabbit for
yourself as the celebrated literary character. H. B. J.

they have of nicknaming a Ministry?
Fancy my first Administration will live
in history as the Tongue-tied Ministry.
Odd how fortune seems to pursue me on
that tack. Last Session I was wholly
unable to say anything in reply to
questions as to Ministerial position in
respect of Don José's pleasing, agreeable,
convenient plea of fiscal reform. Flatter
myself I did that rather well. The air
of surprised, indignant, pained regret
with which I regarded a Member oppo-
site who put the question was effective,
I thought. My cue was sorrow rather
than anger. Grew to be a little monoto-
nous perhaps at end of third month. But
it served its turn; carried us through
Session.
“Here we are again on quite a new
tack. ‘Our Young Queen and our Old
Constitution’ was a political battle-cry
sixty-seven years ago. “Their New Tack
and My Old Tactics’ is my motto to-day.
What they are now curious about is
when ARNOLD-ForsTER will make a state-
ment on War Office reform? As you
know, thinking we 'd patched up little
Cabinet difference, I named last #.
day as the happy day. Thereupon all the
fat in the fire. No Cabinet secrets, even
to you, dear boy. But, to tell the truth,
“THE TECHNICAL Pig.”
(As reared by the Irish Board of Agriculture.)
Mr. F-rr-l said, “These pigs were only fitted
for a coursing match. #. grew tall and
thin, and the people were tired of feeding
them.”
Our artist fancies he knows another Irish
pig of a lean and hungry order that the British
ople are rather tired of feeding—with legis-
ation.
LABBY AND LITTLE ENGLAND.
Mr. Labouchere. “That's right, my boy!
That's the way to improve your physique.
If
all the nation were like you we should have no more wars.”
(Mr. L-b-ch-re said he was always glad to see a poor child smoking cigarettes.
Not only
was he preparing for himself a happy old age, but he was not likely to swell the list of the
criminal classes.
When carried away by his passions, instead of avenging himself on someone,
he simply smoked a cigarette and it all went off.)
and I have mentioned it in the Commons,
I really can't at this moment say any-
thing on the subject.
“That quite enough for fellows oppo-
site. Instantly off in full hue and cry.
Wanting to know, you know. For all
reply I say I don't know. Curious
position I admit for a Premier still
master of legion majority in Commons.
But it can't be helped, and what can't
be helped must be smiled at.”
Thus PRINCE ARTHUR on the situation,
which is certainly complicated. House
in Committee on Budget involving
colossal expenditure. But it is the lobby,
the smoking-room, the Terrace, that are
centres of business.
Wherever two or three are met together
there is Rumour in the midst of them.
All about scheme of Army Reform,
recommended by Esher Committee.
Report was a swingeing slap in the face
for Army administration as exemplified in
Transvaal War. ARNOLD-ForsTER having
succeeded BRODRICK in Pall Mall made
haste to accept Report, embodying grave
vote of censure on his predecessors.
Time was when upon such indictment
a Minister would have been haled forth
and shot. Not likely that LANSDowne
and BRODRICK will take the impeachment
lying down. Have turned at bay, so
umour aforesaid reports, and bar the
progress of the proposed revolution in
Army administration recommended by
the Esher Report.
Someone must resign, it is said. Who?
and what then? To have an occasional
reconstruction of a Cabinet, say once
in twelve months, may be possible.
But, really, two in eight months is more
than even PRINCE ARTHUR's light-hearted-
ness can accomplish without final disaster.
On the top of turmoil comes news

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
s
from Devonport that on the heaviest
poll ever taken Ministerial candidate,
fighting under exceptionably favourable
personal conditions, has been beaten by
the biggest majority in the Borough's
record. No wonder that when at mid-
might WINSTON CHURCHILL wanted to
move to report progress in Committee
on Budget Bill, PRINCE ARTHUR (in a
parliamentary sense of course) nearly
snapped his head off.
“The fact,” he said, “that the hon.
Member is desirous of speaking delibe-
rately against his own convictions is no
ground for the House adjourning at this
untimely hour.”
Business done.—Alarums, excursions
and, incidentally, Budget Bill slowly
pushed through Committee by force
of closure. Nature of the alarums
indicated above. Excursions made by
Duke of BEDFORD with Government
Whips hot foot in pursuit. Last week
His Grace handed in notice of desire
to call attention to Report of War Office
Reconstitution Committee and ask for
information.
There you are again. Information
Thirst for it is the touch of nature that
makes Lords and Commons kin. Nothing
could be more awkward than debate
on subject at present moment. So
Duke, hunted out from successive lairs,
finally caught up and induced stealthily
to withdraw from the premises. Accord-
ingly, when in due course his motion
was reached, lo, the Duke was not, and
the inconvenient question was passed
OWer.
What a night we are having, to be
sure
Tuesday.—Yet oncemore, oh yelaurels,
and once more, ye myrtles brown, is
brought home tousthenecessity of further
reform of procedure. When House re-
sumed sitting at nine o'clock it was
obvious Ministers were in a minority.
Attitude of Opposition instantly changed.
Through afternoon they had been pain-
fully insistent upon thrashing out a
uestion before going to a division.
§. when patience was exhausted
and closure threatened or actually in-
voked, they strolled forth at the leisurely
pace in favour with Cousin HUGH when
he “loitered in the Lobby” in final
effort to defeat the Deceased Wife's
Sister's Bill.
Now, eager above all thin
despatch of business, the Opposition
clamour for a division. But ACLAND
Hood—on this hot summer º more
vividly than ever recalling the Pink "Un
—is on guard, and the schemers opposite
are defeated. Thing to do is start talk,
keep it going till lingerers at distant
dinner tables come back to post of duty.
In these crises FitzALAN HoPE and
BANBURY are invaluable. The fact that
they have nothing to say is no impedi-
for the
ment to speech. To-night FITZALAN HOPE,
with one eye on the clock and the other
on the door at which the Pink 'Un from
time to time looked in and counted heads,
talked for forty minutes. RICHARDs, K.C.,
producing imaginary brief, put in twenty
minutes, in course of which he proposed
alluring programme on which the
Government might go to a grateful
country. Free Breakfast Table; Old
Age Pensions; Free Drinks.
“That'll fetch 'em,” said the K.C.,
smacking his lips and dreamily regard-
ing the impatient Opposition shouting
for a division.
“THE PINK 'UN
“From time to time looked in and counted
heads.”
(Sir Al-x-nd-r Acl-nd-H-d.)
Twenty minutes past ten, and parties
so evenly balanced as to make division
still risky. Then the Pink 'Un brought
up his reserves. BANBURY took the cake
—I mean the floor. A howl of despair
went up from Opposition. Minis-
terialists, summoned by telephone and
special messengers, beginning to stream
in. BANBURY safe for an hour if neces-
sary. Ten minutes sufficed. The
citadel was saved. Not for the first time
in history had cackling done it.
Returning to table after division the
Pink 'Un, palpitating but triumphant,
announced a majority of forty-six.
But why all this trouble? Why not
fill up the interval with music or a game
of Bridge, or interchange of those free
drinks over which RICHARDs, K.C., just
now smacked anticipatory lips? Here
was an hour and a half absolutely
wasted. It must have sped in any case.
The interval might just as well be
pleasantly passed as be devoted to the
manufacture of sham speeches delivered
amid persistent uproar.
Business dome.—Budget Bill in Com-
mittee. An hour and a half being
wasted after dinner regained by sitting
after midnight.
Wednesday.—Important question sud-
denly sprung on House. d CHARLES
JAMES MURRAY, Member for Coventry,
“beri-beri in his mind” when he
handed in a motion relating to the
transportation of Chinese labour to
South Africa?
It was WINSTON CHURCHILL who put
the question and insisted on an answer.
(Perhaps it should be said that beri-beri
is not a species of coffee, subject to
taxation by an impecunious Chancellor
of the Exehequer. It is a form of
indisposition, and there was in the
Member for Oldham's voice a note of
commiseration as he turned upon the
Member for Coventry and pressed his
enquiry.) In the interests of public busi-
ness it would perhaps have been better
if Mr. MURRAY had, so to speak, made
a clean breast of it. Brought up in the
Diplomatic service, working early and
late at the Foreign Office—that is to
say, he arrived late and left early—
sometime attaché at Rome, later serving
his country at St. Petersburg, he is
habitually prone to reticence. He sat
º, silent, preserving the secret
whether at a particular moment he had
or had not “beri-beri in his mind.”
Consequences calamitous. Dr.HUTCHIN-
SON, taking a professional interest in the
case, wanted to move the adjournment
in order to discuss it as a matter of
urgent public importance. DEPUTY
SPEAKER declined to submit proposal.
HUTCHINSON waved his arms in despair.
WINSTON jumped up and down on the
bench in fashion which recalled gym-
nastic exercise of Swift MACNEILL. In
the absence of C.-B., REDMOND aimé took
the lead of the Opposition, sternly cross-
examining PRINCE ARTHUR.
Above the uproar Dr. HUTCHINSON
could be heard shouting, Twenty-four
hours will make all the difference.”
At this ominous remark, carrying with
it the weight of professional reputation,
CHARLEs JAMES MURRAY was observed to
go pale. Was it as bad as that? Could
it be possible that within twenty-four
hours there might be a vacancy at
Coventry? Still he said nothing, nursin
his secret with set lips, and arms folde
across a manly chest in which, for all
others knew, the seeds of beri-beri might
at that moment be germinating.
Clamour still at height when Mr.
Lowther, on double duty to-day, slipped
out of Chair where he had presided as
Deputy Speaker, seated himself at the
Table and cried “Order Order " '' in
his new capacity as Chairman of Ways
and Means. Dr. HUTCHINSON flapped his

arms once or twice. But it was merely
the impetus of earlier exertion. WIN-
STON CHURCHILL jumped up once more.
The action also was automatic. The
House, finding itself in Committee, sub-
sided.
The Member for Coventry seized the
opportunity to withdraw, carrying with
him to the seclusion of the Library the
secret whether, when he handed in his
blocking motion, he had (or suspected
he had) symptoms of “beri-beri in his
mind.”
Business done.—Still harping on the

CHARIVARIA.
It is at last possible to record a
genuine Russian success on land. A
party of Cossacks fired two volleys at
some workmen at Warsaw during a
riot, and killed one.
Among those who accuse the Japanese
of outrages on the Russian wounded
appears the name of the novelist
NEMIRowiTCH DANTCHENKo, whose imagina-
tive works are deservedly popular among
his countrymen.
The Russians have been much en-
couraged by a report that in the Ameri-
can State of Washington a crawling
army of caterpillars has done enormous
damage.
Everyone was sorry for Japan when
she lost two transports the other day,
but we think the British Navy carried
its sympathy too far when the Sparrow-
hawk promptly committed suicide on
a rock at the mouth of the Yangtse
Kiang. -
The London Naval Volunteers, under
the Hon. RUPERT GUINNEss, have now
formally taken over H.M.S. Buzzard.
They would like it to be known that
they intend to take their duties seriously,
in spite of the fact that the names of the
ship and her commander are strongly
suggestive of cakes and ale.
RAISUL1, the Moroccan brigand, chose
the Daily Mail as the means of com-
municating his defence to the British
Public; but we understand that a packet
of circulars relating to a more expensive
paper has now been sent to him.
Among the prizes given by the Leices-
tershire Agricultural Society was one to
the carter who had worked longest with-
out returning home intoxicated while in
charge of his team. Much as we dislike
brag, we cannot resist pointing out that
England is the only country in the
world where such prizes are offered.

Disappointment is in store for any

lanation why a certain distinguished
.P. of the same name went over to
the other side of the House.
The SHAH's brother has fled to Turkey
for protection, and the SULTAN has ad-
vised him to be a sensible fellow and
return to Persia to be killed.
A train at Greenore last week dashed
into the refreshment room of the local
station. We understand that a serious
accident was only prevented by the buns
which successfully acted as buffers.
A propos of the enquiry into the
administration of the Chantrey Bequest
|Sir E. J. Poynter has declared that the

to uphold the honour and position of
British Art. One was hoping for its
own sake that it had not done quite its
best. --
A by-law forbids the entry of children

PUNCE, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S SYMPOSIA.
XVIII.-SHOULD CATs BE TAxED2
SCENE–Kilkenny Castle.
PRESENT:
Mr. Justice Grantham (in the Chair).
The Editor of the “Spectator.”
The Editor of the “Lancet.”
Mr. Harry Kremnitz.
Mr. Louis Wain.
Mr. Plowden.
Mr. James Caldwell, M.P.
The Bishop of Sodor and Man.
Mr. Jamrach.
Mr. F. G. Kitton.
Mr. Justice Grantham. It is with great
pleasure that I have acceded to the
request that I should occupy the Chair
on this interesting occasion. The sub-
ject is a delicate one, and needs a
judicial and dispassionate mind, which,
as one of His Majesty's judges, I am
professionally bound to possess. I trust
therefore that the distinguished gentle-
men present will conduct the controversy
in a manner worthy of the traditions of
English fair play and moderation. For
my own part I have no hesitation in
saying that if I had my way I should
exterminate every single cat in Great
Britain and Ireland.
Editor of the “Spectator.” And every
married cat, too, may I ask?
Mr. Justice Grantham. I used the
word “single” as an adjective of
number, not of celibacy.
Editor of the “Spectator.” I beg par-
don. The correspondence can now cease.
Editor of the “Lancet.” If I may be
allowed to remind our Chairman, it is
not the extermination but the taxation
of cats which we are met to discuss.
Mr. Justice Grantham. Quite so. I
was just coming to that. Ought cats to
be taxed? Speaking then without the
least animus or prejudice I should say
that every cat should be taxed to the hilt.
Mr. Plowden. I agree with my brother
GRANTHAM. Every cat has nine lives:
why, therefore, should it not pay nine
taxes?
Bishop of Sodor and Man. The CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE ExCHEQUER would no doubt
hail this arrangement, but as a loyal
Manxman I should be content with the
rule, one tail one tax.
Mr. James, Caldwell. Representing as
he does an island from which so many
tales come, and all of them so far-
reaching and unparalleled, I think his
Lordship very moderate.
Editor of the “Spectator.” I regret to
note not merely the inhumanity, but the
unsound fiscal bias, of the previous
speakers. Nominally advocated as a
means of raising revenue, the cat tax is,
I believe, promoted to protect the mouse-
trap makers and cheesemongers.
Mr. Jamrach. The higher journalism
would not alone suffer by this nefarious
proposal. If you tax cats, logic would
compel you to include the whole class of
felidae.
Mr. Justice Grantham. Inever thought
of that. Now that I come to think of it,
apes, chimpanzees, gorillas and baboons
ought to be taxed before cats. This is
really a most perplexing subject.
Mr. Plowden. But only, I presume,
when living. Brother GRANTHAM surely
would not tax taxidermy? My late
colleague, Lord BRAMPION, then Mr.
Justice HAWKINS (it was before he rose
to fame as the uncle of Mr. ANTHONY
HoPE), used always to keep his fox
terrier under the Bench. I tremble to
think of the subversion of justice which
might result at Marylebone were I to
permit a cat to occupy a similar position.
Bishop of Sodor and Man. And yet I
have no doubt you could make a cat
laugh.
Mr. Plowden. Not always. I remem-
ber a venturesome tabby, greatly daring,
who once strolled in during a morning
sitting. I tried all my best things on
her without effect. I raked her fore
and aft with facetiae, and she took no
notice. It was subsequently I discovered
that she belonged to Mr. Justice DARLING.
Mr. Jamrach. I see; her standard of
humour was different.
Mr. Plowden. Precisely. But no one
who does not laugh easily is encouraged
to remain in my Court.
Mr. Harry Kremnitz. So far as I can
understand, the conversation is being
directed against cats. I came here as a
delegate of the Leeds Physical Culture
Society, under the impression that a tax
on hats was to be discussed. Is it hats
or cats?
Chorus. Cats.
Mr. Harry Kremnitz. Thank you.
Then I will return to Leeds. But first
I should like to say a few words about
the insanitary effect of wearing hats.
Hats—
Bishop of Sodor and Man. At what
age would the tax begin? Would it
extend to kittens?
Mr. F. G. Kitton. I have a cat named
Boz, the imposition of a tax upon whom
I should resist tooth and nail.
Editor of the “Spectator.” Might not
the tax be reserved only for cats with
musical ambitions? A silent cat, a cat
averse from night duty—ought not he
to be immune?
Mr. Justice Grantham. The last
speaker's plea does credit to his
humanity. But how it would open the
door to perjury ! I can conceive of
nothing on earth so base, so obnoxious
to the august monarch of this Empire,
as a cat-owner who, for the sake of
saving a few paltry shillings, pro-
nounced his pet grimalkin mute when
it was vocal.
Editor of the “Spectator.” Might not
then a cat who figured in an article or
letter in the superior weekly press be
exempted from paying a tax evermore—
just as jurymen on a Grand Jury are
thereafter free? I cannot bear to think
of all cats being treated equally.
Editor of the “Lancet.” Every cat
should be taxed, and that rigorously.
The cat is one of the busiest of the
media for conveying disease to man. It
is the Carter-Paterson of microbes, the
Pickford of bacilli. I never see a child
fondle a cat but I see also in fancy a
dozen funeral processions.
Bishop of Sodor and Man. You seem
to have a cheerful mind. I should like
to go to the Cat Show with you on a
wet day.
Mr. Justice Grantham. What sum is
* proposed impost likely to bring
IIl
Mr. James Caldwell. I have worked
out the matter with the assistance of Sir
ROBERT GIFFEN, and we find that the feline
population of Great Britain and Ireland
at this moment is twenty-three million.
To-morrow it may be more. A poll tax
of, say—
Mr. Plowden. Are pole-cats also to be
taxed then?
Mr. James Caldwell. A poll tax of,
say, only a shilling a year, would yield
a sum of £1,150,000. No doubt the
CHANCELLOR OF THE ExCHEQUER could do
with that. But it is proposed that the
tax should be higher than a shilling.
Mr. Justice Grantham. Do I under-
stand that, if it were only high enough,
it might pay off the National Debt?
Mr. James Caldwell. Certainly.
Mr. Justice Grantham. How very in-
teresting ! Then I think that in that
case there cannot be two opinions, and
we may consider the matter carried.

REAL FAIRY TALES.
THE PRODIGY AT HOME.
(With acknowledgments to the “Daily Chronicle.”)
THE young Bessarabian violinist,
BoLESLAs BILGER, whose capture by
Carpathian condottieri we noted in a
recent issue, is now in London, and has
secured a temporary domicile in a bijou
residence at Peckham Rye.
In the course of audience graciously
granted to one of our representatives
he stated that he might remain in
London until the middle of the next
week, when he is due at Potsdam.
“The KAISER,” lisped young BoLESLAS,
who speaks ten languages with the
utmost fluidity, “takes the deepest
interest in my career.”
“Not only that,” chimed in his singu-
larly beautiful mother, Madame ARIADNE
BILGER, “but he writes to him almost
everyday in Bessarabian to know how
he is getting on.” Here Madame BILGER
opened a richly embossed perdoneum
and produced one of the latest letters
of the KAISER to his protégé.
Unfortunately, at the urgent and
peremptory request of Lord LANSDowne,
we are forbidden to reprint this priceless
document, which opens with the touch-
ing exordium, “From the Admiral of
the Atlantic to the Apollo of the Balkans.”
“Is it not kind of the KAISER to write
like that?” remarked young BILGER, his
lovely eyes brimming over with trans-
lucent teardrops. “He knows my life's
history: that I have already eclipsed
my illustrious father, ERASMUs BILGER;
that I was the favourite pupil of Liszt,
RUBINSTEIN, SousA and STEPHEN ADAMS,
and subsequently studied at the Tokio
Conservatoire under YAMAGATA, NoDZU
and Colonel Ocobo. But I hate to talk
of myself.”
After a brief interval the Wunderkind
resumed, “I commenced playing in
public four years ago, and have since
visited Bosnia, Herzegovina, Circassia,
Carlsbad, South Carolina, Llandudno,
Blackpool, and Nova Zembla.
“At Constantinople I had to play
before the SULTAN. I appeared in a
theatre attached to the harem.”
Madame BILGER here hastily inter-
rupted: “The SULTAN would not of
course permit an adult virtuoso to play
there, but made an exception in favour
of baby BoLESLAS, who could not under-
stand the nature of his audience. The
SULTAN sat in the centre, with his two
youngest sons, BUIBUL and KABOB, and
round them sat his Majesty's wives and
daughters. I learned subsequently that
there were 283 wives and 214 daughters.”
“Yes,” added her son, “and when I
broke a string, the SULTAN kindly obliged
me with a bowstring of his own. Wasn't
it kind of him 2"

Fair Sitter (to exhausted photographer). “SHALL I smile ”
LINES TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD.
My Self's part-creature, whose eccentric shape,
Making thy lord a public raree-show,
Doth ride my hitherto unconscious nape,
Plain to all eyes save mine; to whom I owe
The consequence—more galling than a blow—
Of ribald gesture and unfettered jape
That marks our passage wheresoe'er we go;
Back of my Head, to-day I looked on thee,
And am resigned to Fate's inscrutable decree.
'Tis sad to hear the personal remark
Rising distinctly o'er the social hum;
'Tis sad to see the mirth-enkindled spark
In eyes that always brighten when we come;
Sad to be conscious of the gibing thumb,
Yet find the cause thereof ...i. dark;
To move 'mid waggish coteries, where some,
With contumelious fluttering of the lid,
Ask, “Did you ever?” or reply, “They never did "
Oft have I cast an apprehensive glance
Into some friendly mirror standing by,
Fearing that by some tragical mischance
I might have come away without my tie;
Yet was my habit formal to the eye.
True, I am something strange of countenance,
But there are others even more awry;
My contour—there are others far more fat;
I knew not what those lunatics were laughing at .
And it has been that men have called me proud,
For I have tamed my features to a stare
Of lofty tolerance, and spurned the crowd
With the unruffled camel's tranquil air
Of one superior, who doesn't care!
They knew not that my spirit cried aloud
To beg the stronger kindly to forbear;
To bid the small be careful what he said;
And, with a brave man's wrath, to punch the weakling's
head.
To-day I tarried for a fleeting space
Where my confiding tailor plies his craft;
I met my mirrored double face to face,
, (How strange') I saw him sideways and abaft
And, for the coolness of the genial draught,
Had cast my topper from his wonted place;
And then, O clear as tho' 'twere pºple,
Thou crusher of a good man's sturdy pride,
I saw thy multiple aspect, and was petrified
I have no will to hold thee up to scorn,
Nor power to say: No more be Head of mine !
Thou art my burden, and must needs be borne.
But I go humbly, and henceforth decline
All indoor fêtes; I shall not dance or dine;
I shall go nowhere save when hats are worn

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OPERATIC NOTES.
Monday, June 20–First night of new opera by M. SAINT-
SAENs, on a very old subject entitled Hélène. In justice to
the composer and the librettist, two single gentlemen rolled
into one in the person of M. SAINT-SAENS, it must be at once
stated that this work is described in the programme as
Miss Regents-Parkina-Venus, surrounded by the pupils of her mixed
educational establishment taking the air, tells Hélène-Melba that, to
complete her education, she must go to Paris.
“Poème Lyrique in Siz Tableaux,” which may be regarded
as a pro-grammatical translation of “Poème Lyrique en un
Acte,” as it is styled on the cover of the published book.
Ergo, an opera of dramatic action was not to be expected,
nor must it be criticised as such. If, from the first, Glück is
recalled to us, so that we have come to look upon it as a
Happy G'lucky sort of undramatic piece, it is not until the
final tableau that we are forcibly reminded of OFFENBACH's
Belle Hélène, and then we miss the presence of Calchas,
Ménélas, and many lasses and lads besides, not to mention
the sparkling light music that used to set us all a-humming
and made of the audience one great “Music Bee.” SAINT-
SAENs’ “poème lyrique” is a work sans-songs. Nor does
it lend itself more readily to action than does any passage
between a Wagnerian hero and heroine.
The scenery for this poem is specially remarkable for the
frozen fountain in front of the Palace of Ménélas, the water
of which, having reached a certain height, has struck and
refused to come down again. That the “sky-borders” should
materially interfere with the realistic effect of Troy town
a-burning in the distance appears to everyone, artistically

interested, as “uncommonly hard lines.” The Sky-boarders,
i.e. the divinities temporarily stopping in Olympus, were,
it is true, very hard on the Trojans. This by the way.
The stage direction in the first scene is “Chants et danses
dans le palais.” We hear the singing, but can only take
the word of the librettist for the fact of any dancing going
on within the palace of our old friend King Ménélas. No
doubt the two Ajax and all our old classical friends (“Vive
Lemprière!”) are performing an hilarious cancan while Hélène
is stealing out to meet that gay young dog Paris. And
Hélène, dame MELBA, not looking particularly classical,
but very unhappy, does come out all alone, except for being
accompanied by the orchestra, to cool her fevered brow with
a stroll on the shore of the poluphloisboio thalasses, meaning
“the briny,” where she amuses herself with declamatory
utterances which are of no particular interest, either musi-
cally or dramatically, to anybody.
Then Venus, Miss E. PARKINA, appears in a kind of mid-air
garden, “peuplé de Nymphes et d'Amours” (ahem! Venus
with all her Amours—except her amour propre), and sings
charmingly. There are “visions about,” and most effective,
musically and dramatically, is the appearance of Mme. KIRKBY
LUNN as Pallas up in the air and thoroughly well up in the
music, who, after announcing the burning of Troy (which
you can see for yourself “while you wait”), disappears.

times, but Conductor MESSAGER does not come to the front (in
this sense at least), nor does the composer, M. C. SAINT-SAENs,
for whose absence Madame MELBA despairingly apologises in
dumb show.
After this, “Bang goes saxpence 1" that is, we have
“cannons to right of them, cannons to left of them” in
La Navarraise, which, beginning in smoke, so ends, and is all
sound and fury signifying very little to anyone, and least of
all to Mme. DE NUowINA as Anita, a part to which Mme. CALVé
contrived to give whatever of dramatic significance it is
capable: but then CALvá herself is capable detout.

comer as Maddalena, and Signor DANI is raised to the operatic
rage as “the New Duke.” It cannot be said of Signor

able Corporal Brewster observes, “it wouldn't do for the

Thursday, June 23–Habitués arriving at the Opera House
punctually, regretted the hurried cutlet and hasty pudding
they had taken in order to obey the showman's usual adjura-
tion “to be in time” for Leoncavallo's delightful opera.
But “the old order changeth, yielding place to new,” and at
the last moment La Navarraise preceded Pagliacci.
Salutations to Pagliacci, “by RUGGIERo LEONCAVALLo (born
1858).” Quite the Nedda, in appearance, as is Mlle. AURéLIE

MELBA. -
As Tonio Signor Scotti was all that could be desired,
except his make-up. Unless our memory is deceitful, Tonio,
when he first appeared at Covent Garden, used to be in a
sort of Pierrot's costume, and thus attired he sang the great
prologue. Without the Pierrot's dress two-thirds of the
dramatic effect are lost. Clever artist as Scotti is, herein he
has made a mistake.
M. SEVEILHAC as Silvio is good, but he bears not the gay
plumage of the cock of the village, such as befits the gay
rustic-maiden-killer, son of a superior farmer. Silvio is a
provincial rustic masher, and M. SEVEILHAG doesn't raise him
up above an ordinary gardener. But Signor CARUso as

IN TOPSY-TURWY LAND.
THE production of Mr. W. S. GILBERT's
most amusing study in topsy-turvydom
entitled Harlequin and the Fairy's
Dilemma, “An Original Domestic Panto-
mime in Two Acts,” which has been
running at the Garrick Theatre for the
last six or seven weeks, was a decidedly
happy thought on the part of Mr. ARTHUR
BourCHIER, lessee, manager, excellent
comedian, and first-class professor of
general utility, whose representation of
the heavy-cavalry officer Colonel Sir
Trevor Mauleverer is only equalled by
his perfect rendering, in the same piece,
of the old-fashioned traditionary JoEY
GRIMALDI clown. Startlingly humorous
too is the transformation of the elegant
Lady Angela Wealdstone, charmingly
played by Miss WIOLET WANBRUGH, into
the short-skirted, gracefully dancing
and posturing Columbine.
Mr. SYDNEY WALENTINE's characterisa-
tion of conceited Mr. Justice Whortle,
“of the High Court of Judicature,” who
has an intense appreciation of the jokes
with which he beguiles the jury, the
- - - bar, and the public, is as excellent as
his impersonation of doddering dotage when compelled by
magic art to appear as shaky old Pantaloon.
i. JESSIE BATEMAN is delightful as the ordinary theatrical
type of fairy in a pantomime, able to parrot a few lines of
rhyme, without regard to their meaning, and waving her
wand in the conventional style. The author has made the
character as muddle-headed a supernatural being as Puck
in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
The old-fashioned theatrical, tinsel-eyelided and spangled
demon Alcohol, capitally played by Mr. JERROLD Robertshaw,
belongs, as do both “supernaturals,” only to pantomime, and
they are puzzling even at that, when, in the last scene, they

by the Rev. Aloysius Parfitt, M.A., of St. Parabola's, which
character, as portrayed by Mr. O. B. CLARENCE, is quite the
most absurdly humorous performance in this extravaganza,
where everything, and everybody, is so supremely ridiculous.
By the way, is some subtle joke intended to be conveyed
by the mispronunciation of the comic clergyman's christian
name, Aloysius, which is pronounced by everyone, in this
piece at the Garrick Theatre, as Aloysius 2 Correctly the
name should be pronounced Aloysius. Never as “Aloysius.”
Would either “satirical rogue,” author or actor (the latter an
Oxford man), pronounce Heloise as Heloys, or Louis, mono-
syllabically, as Lous?
Mr. RICKETT's music, Mr. John D'AUBAN's dances, and Mr.
BRUCE SMITH's scenery, all conduce to the success achieved by
this mirth-provoking, topsy-turvy piece of absurdity.

T was in a corner of the County Ground that Mr. PUNCH, who had looked in for a few minutes to see how the
match was progressing, came across the famous Cricketer. On the approach of the Sage the Young Athlete—the
picture of health, strength, and good looks—hastily thrust into his pocket a note-book in .. he had been writing.
“Well,” said Mr. PUNCH, “your work for the day is over, I suppose—if it can be called work; while I xx
and the Sage sighed as he thought of the Atlantean burden to be dealt with before he sought his couch.
“Come, Sir,” replied the Cricketer, “I bet you that I work harder than you do.”
“I’m open to conviction,” replied Mr. PUNCH, “but I don't see how you can prove it.”
“Very well, then. Now listen. To-day I made 120 not out, was interviewed twice, photographed three times,
and wrote half a column for the Daily Demagogue. I'm off now to get a bit of dinner, and before I turn in I’ve got
to finish an article on the Economics of Sport for the Statist. If I get to bed by 12, I shall consider myself lucky.”
“Then I suppose you'll take it out in the morning?”
“Not a bit of it. I’ve got to keep fit, and to do that one must live by rule. Out of bed at 7, a run round
the Park if I’m in town, and an hour's work before breakfast at a book I'm writing on the Psychology of Athletics.
Cricket and journalism all day, a lecture at the Breakback Institute on the Imperial Solidarity of Pastime, and then
I'm off by a midnight train to Manchester, where I'm playing for the next three days. If you can show a heavier
time-table I should like to see it.”
Mr. PUNCH pondered for a moment. It was open to him to retort that work must be measured by quality not
uantity, and that between the exertions of the journalist-athlete and his own colossal achievements there was a
ifference not only in degree but in kind. But he decided to waive that point and vary his attack.
“It seems to me, my young friend, that you lead a sufficiently strenuous life—early to rise, and late to bed,
and filling up all your available time with literary work.”
44 %. that's about it,” replied the young Apollo.
“Cricketers were not always like that,” said Mr. PUNCH. “In the old days when professionals wore grey shirts,
a cricketer was more afraid of a pen than a bumpy wicket. But now you are all brainy. The old charge against
* of being brainless Philistines, ‘young barbarians all at play,' can no longer be made good. It doesn't fit the
acts.”
“Well, I think the ‘flannelled fools' and “muddied oafs' was pitching it a bit strong.”
- “Just so,” rejoined Mr. PUNCH. “The mischief of it is that the flannelled and muddied ones, so far from
being fools and oafs, are on your own showing, for I don't suppose you are an altogether exceptional case, men

capable of serving their country with their brains as well as their hands, instead of merely ministering to her
amusement.”
“Well, Sir, you may be right, but at any rate we work hard enough for our living.”
“Yes, and that's the pity of it—all this energy and ability lavished on games, when the country is crying
out for efficiency and intelligence in Commerce and the Army and Navy. You're fond of quoting poetry in your
articles, so perhaps you'll allow me to adapt a familiar couplet for your benefit:—
“He strengthened his muscles, but narrowed his mind, .
And to pastime gave up what was meant for mankind.”
If we are heading straight for Conscription it is you who are largely to blame for it. By the way,” added Mr. PUNCH,
“what are your views of Conscription?”
“Oh, I don't set up to be a thinker,” replied the Athlete, “but I don't fancy it would work at all. English-
men would never stand that. They like to serve their country of their own free will.”
“Now you, for example,” said the Sage, “I suppose that you are a Volunteer?”
“No,” said the Cricketer, “I can't say that I am. Volunteering seems to me to be very poor fun.”
“But a Wolunteer may be very useful when the country is in ăj don't you think so? They were by
no means ciphers in the Boer War.”
“Well, yes. I approve of Volunteering if a man has the time.”
“Time!” said the Sage. “My good young friend, I am afraid that I must take you in hand a little. Has it
never occurred to you that you are overdoing all these athletics, that it is time to grow up and be rather more
serious? Cricket is a splendid thing; football is a splendid thing; but no healthy fine young fellow like you ought
to spend the whole summer in knocking a solid ball about and the whole winter in kicking a hollow one. That is
only a small part of life, and you are making it the whole. Is there no Empire to expand, no country to be defended?
Are we not menaced at every turn by clever young Americans and plodding young Germans? Against their quickness
and thoroughness are we to offer no resistance but fine averages? What will a long score too often made or a goal
too often kicked serve you in the battle of life? An occasional game refreshes and strengthens; continuous play is
sterilising. England at this moment needs thoughtful, active, patriotic sons much more than dashing cricketers. Every
young man should try to do something for his country, and take some interest in affairs.”
“But there's no fun in such matters,” replied the youth.
“No fun?” echoed the Sage. “There you are very wrong. The study of affairs can be as diverting as a
Pavilion story, and far more instructive at the same time. And if you will promise me to make the attempt to think
less of the games and more of the duties of the splendid young Englishman that you are, I will give you the secret
of combining love of country with love of humour.” And on the young man acquiescing in the compact Mr. PUNCH
placed in his hands his
