HERE'S A PRETTY GO!
(At Wyndham's Theatre.)
In The Finishing School Mr. Max PEM-
BERTON has given us what he defines as
a Romance, but it should certainly be
classed as a Comedy, that is, if it be
still allowable by the kind permission of
the late respected lexicographer, Dr.
SAMUEL JOHNSON, SO to consider Dr.
OLIVER GOLDSMITH's She Stoops to Conquer,
to which class of Dramatic composition
this piece belongs. It is a pretty play,
of a somewhat old-fashioned type, with a
fascinatingly wilful girl-heroine, Dorothy
Melville, cleverly played by Miss ANNIE
HUGHES, who, masquerading at a ball, as
a petit-maître just imported from Paris,
is one of the daintiest little persons ever
seen on the English stage. The piece
is uncommonly well rendered by every-
one concerned in its production, which
is saying a great deal where there are
over thirty dramatis personæ.
In the First Act the stage manage-
ment of the action, which leads up to
the most telling climax in the hurried
Gretna Green marriage, is admirable.
The earlier part of the last Act, the
scene in the school-room, 5 A.M., still
requires just that careful rehearsal which
the previous Acts have obtained, as the
sly but nervous girls creeping about
at that hour, fearing detection, would
never dare to talk as loudly as they do,
still less to scream.
Mr. BARNES, as Sir John Vane, the
testy, warm-hearted, pugnacious old
father of the Sir Anthony Absolute type,
is excellent; and not a point is lost by
either actor or actress in the scenes
between him and the naughty lovable
little Dorothy.
Well played by Mr. BEN WEBSTER is t ard Soncervel

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MY MALADY.
I AN not feeling very well to-day ;
I know not what the malady may be ;
Less than a week ago I felt as gay
And active as a-grig.
But I am sad; I get no rest at night;
I tremble at the buzzing of a gnat;
I do not take my meals with appetite;
My heart goes pit-a-pat.
My vigour--and my sprightliness--have flown;
The social qualities my friends enjoyed
Have left me; I desire to be alone,
And not to be annoyed.
I know there's nothing wrong with limb or lung
Or liver, as the flippant might suppose
(Rejoice, all you that love me, for my tongue
Is like a Red, Red Rose).
But there's a something--though I can't say what ---
That burrows--though I couldn't tell you where;
Nor could I even stroke th' afflicted spot,
And say, “The pain is there."
This is not one of those established ills
Which of their nature leave an qutward sign ;
It does not make one pale about the gills,
This malady of mine.
" It is the little rift within the lute";
Some fatal, undiscoverable germ
That by-and-by will make the music mute,
And drag me to the Worm.
And am I then beyond all human cure ?
And will the grim old Gardener come and pluck
My flower of beauty just when it's mature ?

THE ART OF POPULARITY.
(With acknowledgments to “ Home Chat.")
A GOLDEN rule for the achievement of
social success is to be
FORTHCOMING BUT NOT FULSONE.
Don't be careless or indifferent about
meeting people half or even two-thirds
of the way. But to overdo affability is
a fatal error. Thus, to take a practical
instance, it is quite right to offer a
fellow passenger a newspaper, or, on
rare occasions, a sandwich. But to
volunteer to pay the excess fare of a
total stranger, should he be travelling
in a class superior to his fare—that is
going “beyond the beyonds."
Above all things cultivate a good
memory for faces and names. To do so
is an act of loyalty, as well as good
policy, for is not the faculty of remem-
bering faces a peculiarly royal gift?
Yet kings remember, not by divine
right, but as the result of careful train-
ing. When the German Emperor was
in petticoats he was sternly punished if
he could not remember the face of every
Pomeranian grenadier at Potsdam.
There is a touching anecdote of
QUEEN ELIZABETH
in her old age encountering one of her
courtiers and saying, more in sorrow
than in anger, “I remember your name,
but I can't put a face to it.”
If one were asked to define the highest
form of popularity, perhaps the best
answer would be that it was the art of
DIFFUSING SUNSHINE.
To attain this laudable result, health-

Friday is the day the Commons have

House on Friday adjourns at six, so that
week-enders, like C.-B., can get com-
fortably away. Noble Lords, far above
such trivial considerations, rebuke the
Commons by remaining at their post on
Friday nights, often even after dinner.
True, the Commons don't care tuppence
for the snub, but many innocent people
suffer. Gentlemen in the Press Gallery,

night sittings on Wednesdays, are kept

HERE we are, we two, wife and self, with

formed by the meeting of the ways.
Woods to the right of us, as we face the
line of route from Etaples, along which we had
just travelled ; woods to the left of us; woods
at the back of us; the last leading to the sands
of Paris-Plage; the second lot of woods to the
river Canche; and the first, on our right, to Le
Touquet, that is, to the “Hôtel (oh, blissful
idea, suggestive of 'mine ease at mine Inn ') Le

[August 3, 1904.
Uufit to wed, I needs must face
A prospect relatively gloomy,
And begged of her this heavenly grace,
To play the part of sister to me.
Brave soul! She swore to be my wife!
But I protested, hard as granite,
I could not, would not, “spoil her life.”
So ended my affair with JANET !
O.S.
WOMEN I HAVE NEVER MARRIED,
I.
For JANET, once my only joy,
Untempered by mature reflection,
I entertained, while yet a boy,
The very largest predilection.
I was a student, still untried,
In those preliminary stages
When Love politely waives aside
All difference in people's ages.
I did not note, in days “when earth”
(As Pippa sang) “was nigher Heaven,"
How that the years by which her birth
Preceded mine were just eleven.
I knew my soul within her eyes
Had found a kindred soul to mate it;
While of my peers in point of size
Not one could quite appreciate it.
For then-at twelve-my complex brain,
Full of conundrums like a Sphinx's,
Regarded girls with nice disdain
As empty, foolish little minxes.
I wanted (though I had at hand
Coëval loves in nauseous plenty)
A woman who could understand ;
And JANET's age was three-and-twenty.
So I with her, content to wait,
Platonically held communion,
Deferring to a later date
The bliss of more immediate union.
I pictured her always the same,
Unseared by life's refining fuel ;
Nor ever dreamed its furnace-flame
Would ultimately scorch my jewel.
And, when I took a three-years' tour
For purposes of social polish,
“Our love,” I said, “my Koh-i-noor !
Not Time can spoil, nor Space demolish!”
Space proved me right; but as to Time
My hopes sustained a rude miscarriage;
On coming home in manhood's prime
At twenty-one, and ripe for marriage,
I found for Age is apt to do
Its witchcraft inæquali sorte-
My JANET (strictly thirty-two)
To all appearance five-and-forty!
I am no hero, I who write;
I much preferred that any other
Should wed this portly dame that might
With perfect ease have been my mother.
Of course I could not broach the fact
Of Time's discriminative dealings;
Rather by pure unselfish tact
I hoped to spare the lady's feelings.
That strange disparity of years-
(Noblesse obligea) I ignored it,
Discussed the various hemispheres,
The ship, and how I lived aboard it;
Painted myself a gay sea-dog,
A rip, a most notorious flier,
And roughly sketched a lurid log
Which would, in detail, petrify her ;-
THE PREVAILING MUSICAL DEPRESSION.
(Interview with Mr. Endymion Gules.)
PERSISTENT reports having reached him of the extraordinarily
depressed condition of the concert market, Mr. Punch recently
arranged for one of his most trusted representatives to inter-
view Mr. ENDYMION GULES, the famous agent, with a view to
ascertaining the cause of this deplorable state of affairs.
“Yes,” observed the great impresario, “the reports you
speak of are only too true. This has been the worst season
for professional musicians that I have ever known. There
has been no falling off in the importation of foreign cele-
brities, but most of them have been obliged to work their
passages home. One Albanian baritone, a gentleman with a
magnificent voice, has accepted a situation as a chauffeur ;
and a Bohemian violinist, a favourite pupil of SEVCIK, the
famous Prague master, is now engaged as a caddie at Woking.”
“Can you indicate any specific reason for this strange lack
of appreciation on the part of the British public?”
"Certainly. First and foremost I should be inclined to
note the passion for precocity. Nowadays no performer of
over ten years of age has any chance of making a decent
living by music. The prodigies have all done well--some
marvellously well. Little BOLESLAS Bilger bought a gold bath
last week, and has rented one of the largest deer forests in
Inverness-shire. VinoLIA VICHY celebrated her seventh birth-
day by the purchase of a diamond tiara and a turbine yacht.
ATTILA Blum has started a racing stable.”
“But surely there must be other causes at work?”
“I was just coming to that. The fact is, as my colleague
Mr. VERT recently remarked in the Westminster Gazette, that
the public is not just now in a musical mood. People are
preoccupied by a multiplicity of other distractions. In
particular I ascribe the decline of interest in music to the
fashion for experiments in diet, and the crusade against over-
eating. The strain of listening attentively to a concert of two
hours' duration is impossible to persons who are inadequately
nourished. You cannot appreciate WAGNER on a diet of nut
cutlets, or enjoy STRAUSS on barley water."
“Then you hold that there is a close relation between
music and meals ?”
“Unquestionably. No great singer was ever a vegetarian,
and what is true of performers is true of audiences. But
this fad will pass. I am sure that the sanity of the British
public will reassert itself, and that we shall before long
witness the inspiring spectacle of earnest musicians singing
and playing before full houses of properly nourished amateurs."
“I see that Mr. VERT speaks of a spirit of flippancy which
is now abroad, and which has militated against the chances
of serious musicians.”
“Well, there may be something in that, too. STRAUSS has
undoubtedly suffered from the competition of SoCsa.
'Hiawatha' is at the moment more popular than HAYDN, and
SCHUBERT's songs excite less enthusiasm than the Schenectady
putter. Still, I think we may count on the swing of the
pendulum. But the immediate prospect is gloomy, and
though not an extreme politician I should certainly support
legislation prohibiting infant prodigies from pocketing more
than £5,000 in one season, the surplus to be divided amongst
their meritorious colleagues of riper years.”

THE MAKING OF FIRST-CLASS
MEN.
No apology is needed for offering our
school - prospectus to the public in a
novel form. When a boy has seen our
prospectus he will want to see “The
Pavilion," and when he has seen “The
Pavilion " he will want to stay there.
Our desire is to produce practical
results, and a boy on leaving our estab-
lishment should be able at once to get
his own living. Nothing sounds more
difficult and is really so easy. Sporting
Pressmen of the day must not only be
brilliant athletes, but also masters of
the best sporting journalese. Four
years at "The Pavilion” will equip
every boy most efficiently in both these
respects.
The Staff of “The Pavilion " consists
of H. W. DRIVER, Esq., C.B. (Cambridge
Blue), H. PITCHARD, Esq., F.C.S. (First
Class Swerver), K. A. GREEN, Esq.,
G.C.S.I. (Golf Champion of the South
of Ireland), assisted by innumerable
batsmen, bowlers, runners, jumpers,
rowing-men, and all kinds of athletes.
The Matron is Miss ROWENA WOODHEAD,
L.C.C. (Lady Croquet Champion).
No boys are admitted to “The
Pavilion ” who have not been put down
for the M.C.C., and preference is given
to those who were entered at Lord's on
the day succeeding their birth.
Extras include luxuries such as
Classics, Mathematics, English History,
the French Language, and Stewed
Prunes.
One of the most attractive features of
“The Pavilion " is the teaching of the
New Slang Language. At infinite ex-

statement that not a single club of
normal pattern is of the slightest use on
the Culbin Links. McLURKIN's clubs
are not merely unlike any that I have
ever set eyes on in England or America,
but they have special names of their
own. For striking off from the tee he
employs a weapon called a mid-bilger,
with an enormously long shaft and a
head resembling that of a niblick, as
the tees, like most of the course, consist
of extremely fine and loose sand. For
playing through the green-if such a
term can be used-he employs a waffle,
a club with a very “whippy” shaft and
a soft, rather spongy head, made of
compressed seaweed with a leaden face.
With a gale of wind behind him, he can
sometimes hit the ball with the waffle
about sixtyor seventy yards, but I
never succeeded in sending it more than
about half that distance. For approach-
ing he generally uses the sclaffy, a short
iron club with a head shaped rather
like a seltzer-water bottle, but when the
ball is barely visible he takes his delver,
which resembles the spade used in
cutting peats, and literally shovels the
ball out of its lair.

As in no circumstances whatever does
the ball run more than three or four
inches, putting is impossible, and the
place of the hole is taken by a stick, as
in croquet. But I have omitted to
mention the most characteristic of all
the Culbin clubs -- that employed in
extricating the ball from the deep pits
in the heather described in my first
paragraph. For this, McLURKIN, who is
a bit of a mechanic, has devised an
implement which he calls the diver,
which is nothing else than an air-pump
by means of which he is able to blow
the ball out of a hole four 'feet deep.

Sample 1, from “Captain Peck's Picnic,”
by Mr. W. W. Jacobs.
"... After a voyage like mine,

round the comfortable parlour and
settled itself upon the fair face of Mrs.
Briggs' daughter, “it's a pleasure to
sleep ashore again."

“Your ship is lying in the harbour,

Mrs. Briggs, I hope you and your
daughter will come aboard and take

But as to marriage - they were not,
In vulgar parlance, “ taking any."
'Tis true they whispered here and there
Of one whom she declined to mate,
Who took to drink in pure despair,
And motored at a fearful rate;
But, when I struck the rumour's traek
And made a near investigation,
There was no evidence to back
Her partial mother's allegation.
Slowly and with reluctant pain
This doubt arose to give me pause :
Do girls of twenty-eight remain
Spinsters without a cogent cause?
Why should I risk to bark my shin
Against the steps of Hymen's altar;
Why, like a fool, rush madly in
Where wiser men preferred to falter ?
O.S.
WOMEN I HAVE NEVER MARRIED.
II.
How quickly these impressions wane!
I think--but would not like to swear--
It must have been the mise-en-scène
That drew me first to Di ADAIR;
For I have sampled many a view
Before and since, but never seen a
More likely spot for Love's début--
Take it all round-than Taormina.
Sheer crags above, and, sheer below,
The shifting light on narrow seas;
Southward the crater, crowned with snow,
That swallowed poor Empedocles;
Ruins of Roman play-house walls
(Hellenic in their prime construction);---
'Twas there, in two adjacent stalls,
That we dispensed with introduction.
“O Isle of Greater Greece!" I thought;
“O famous Syracusan shore !”
For memory moved me, strangely fraught
With little tags of classic lore;
So that her air, full-blown and blonde
(My fancy being somewhat flighty)
Appeared to me to correspond
Strictly to that of Aphrodite.
And yet a goddess over-ripe
In the technique of Love his trade
Seemed an invidious anti-type
For so demure a British maid ;
Better that I should take the style
Of Ferdinand (wrecked off Girgenti?)
Who found Miranda of the Isle,
A trusting girl of eight-and-twenty.
That lovely heroine's lot was cast
Remote from men; and, much the same,
Dear Di, it seemed, had had no past,
But barely lived before I came.
'Twas well! The warrior sort might choose
Rivals to rout in open action,
But I with my civilian views
Preferred to be the sole attraction.
What might have happed I won't enquire;
For Fate that guards my guileless head
Summoned me home by instant wire
Before the crucial word was said ;
And when, in London's giddier scenes,
Once more we met I nearly fainted
To find her not by any means
The lonely chicken I had painted.
I that was once so nice and near
Felt like a stranger far apart,
Wholly unread in that career
Which others seemed to know by heart ;
These were “lier men ”; I heard her call
Their Christian names -- Tom, Dick and HARRY;
Yet not a man among them all
Had thought her good enough to marry!
No shadow, so I heard, had crept
Across the lady's fair repute
Explaining what it was that kept
The voice of Matrimony mute;
Her 'scutcheon bore no kind of blot ;
She had admirers brave and many,
THE WHITE RABBIT.
CHAPTER II.
The White Rabbit's Character and his Relations with Rob.
IF I frightened you very much by carrying you about in
my mouth, and made you very untidy and rather damp, and
if you knew that I had fully intended to eat you, and had,
in fact, been prevented only by the opportune arrival of a
little girl-well, I don't think we should be very good friends
for the future. It was different, however, with the White
Rabbit and Rob, the Labrador retriever. I am bound in
common honesty to point out all the defects of my hero, and
I may as well tell you at once that the White Rabbit was a
most vain and conceited person. He never saw a girl of any
kind without being convinced she had fallen hopelessly in
love with him :
“I really can't help it,” he used to say ; “I don't try to
make them fall in love with me. I didn't make myself
beautiful: I was just born so, and anybody can see how I
struggle against it all. It's hard lines on the girls, of
course, because I always have said I'm not a marrying man,
but what's a fellow to do when they absolutely won't leave
him any peace? It's all very well for you”--this remark
was addressed to Rob—“ being only a black dog-
“I beg your pardon,” said Rob, with a cold politeness,
"you said ?
“Being only a black dog' was what I said, and of course
you are a black dog, you know, and you do bury your bones.
Oh, I don't blame you for it, my dear Sir; it's instinct or
inherited habit, or some nonsense of that kind, but, thank
Heaven, we 're free from it. Whoever saw a White Rabbit
burying a bone? The very idea is ridiculous.”
"Why, you fluffy fool,” said Rob, who didn't at all relish
these aspersions on dogs, “you long-eared fluffy fool, you
never get a bone given to you. All you get is cabbage or
lettuce leaves, or parsley, or a dish of bran."
“Perfectly true, my dear Sir," said the White Rabbit,
“perfectly true. I don't complain of my diet. I hope I'm
resigned; but what I want you to understand is this: that
it isn't good table manners to bury a bone-you know you
always blush crimson and look hopelessly confused when
you ’re caught doing it-and that if they did give me a bone
I shouldn't bury it. I should put it away neatly in a corner,
that's all. But, of course, if you don't like the subject we'll
change it. I hope I know what's due from me better than
to give pain to anybody by talking about what he doesn't
like. And if you don't like bones---_."
“You bounding blockhead," said Rob, thoroughly annoyed,
“who in the world said I didn't like bones?”

PEOPLE who understand the gist

Of requisites for man and wife,
He notes that each should have a different bent
And be the other party's complement.
True that, in practice, Mrs. B.
(I will not say which had it worse)
Shared in a very marked degree
Her husband's fatal gift of verse;
But still his published theory of Love
Lays down the principle I cite above.
Taking this golden rule for guide,
I, of the somewhat flippant vein,
Wanted a weighty sort of bride
To ballast my so buoyant brain ;
I felt that she, the woman I should wed,
Must be supremely serious in the head.
And such was GRACE. The heart divines
These natures by a second sight;
And certain rather pointed lines,
Writ in her album, proved me right:
“Be good, sweet maid, and let who can be clever”-
And this, I saw, was her precise endeavour.
And yet our loves did not succeed ;
For, though her weight (I here refer
To moral worth) supplied my need,
I was a touch too light for her;
Against the rules that regulate the love-tale
Our complementary tastes refused to dovetail.
She had a trick I could not bear;
She tried (I might have known she would)
To trace, beneath my ribald air,
“Potentialities for good”;
This was to be her future wifely rôle,
Namely, to extricate my lurking soul.
“The world may think you what it will,
But Love," she said, “has keener eyes,
And probes with nice, unerring skill
Beyond the formal crust, or guise;
Under your thinnish coat of comic art
Crouches a grave, austere and noble heart!”
She meant it well. She could not see-
Alas! how seldom women can ! -
That Art, a sacred thing to me,
Must needs reflect the inner Man;
That Humour's motley-wear could never lide
What she attributed to my inside.
And yet, to take the converse case,
If I had been a serious bard,
Would she, I ask, have had the face
To hint that Love's profound regard
Could penetrate the solemn outer sheath
And find the genuine mountebank beneatli ?
Enough. She had to speak the word
That loosed my irritating bands;
And, though my gallant tongue demurred,
And though I raised protesting hands,
A lofty resignation lit my face
Tlie moment she had dealt her coup de GRACE.

THE WHITE RABBIT.
CHAPTER III.
The White Rabbit speaks of his Origin and Ancestry.
“My father and mother,” said the White Rabbit, “ were a
King and a Queen.”
The remark was addressed to Rob, the Labrador, and Gamp,
the black-and-white cat, who were sitting quite amicably
together outside the rails that barred their nearer approach
to the White Rabbit's hutch. Gamp, I must tell you, was the
house-cat, and Rob had been on intimate, not to say amiable,
terms with her ever since the day when, as a young puppy,
he had made a reckless rush at her as she nursed one of her
numerous and recurring families under the kitchen table.
He had rushed back very quickly with his face thoroughly
well scratched, and from that moment he had respected the
indomitable Gamp. “No properly constituted dog," he was
often heard to say in later life, “ought ever to raise a paw in
anger against a lady, even if she happens to be a Cat.”
You will remember that, on the occasion when Rob had
picked up the White Rabbit in his mouth and threatened to
devour him, the White Rabbit had in his terror declared that
he was a Prince in disguise. There is, I believe, no instance
known to history of a Prince in disguise who was eaten.
Since that day Rob had been very inquisitive, and had teased
the White Rabbit a good deal about his royal ancestry, but
the Rabbit had been haughtily reticent. To-day, however,
he seemed to be in a milder mood, and when Rob, who had
winked at the piebald Cat, began by saying, “About that
Prince in disguise, you know. Couldn't you tell us some-
thing?" the White Rabbit had immediately answered him:
“My father and inother,” he said, “ were a King and a
Queen.”
"That doesn't carry us much further," observed the Cat
meditatively. “If you were a Prince, of course your father
and mother must have been a King and a Queen.”
"Well, one must always begin at the beginning,” pleaded
the White Rabbit.
“My dear Sir-_” the Cat began.
“Dear what?” interrupted the White Rabbit in an angry
tone.
“Sir,'” said Rob. “She said it loud enough.”
“I thought that was it,” said the White Rabbit. “My
hearing is pretty good, I think.”
“Your ears are certainly long,” remarked Rob, but the
White Rabbit took no notice of the sarcasm, and went on:
“If she had been educated in the best society she would
have known”-he purposely ignored the Cat and spoke over
her head, as it were, at Rob"she would have known, and so
would you have known, my black friend, that the son of a

Having said this, he assumed an air of immense dignity
and looked up at the ceiling of his hutch as if Rob and Gamp
had entirely passed out of his mind.
“Humour him," whispered Rob to the Cat. “We're sure
to have some fun.”
The Cat winked slowly and almost invisibly at Rob, and
addressed the White Rabbit again :
“If,” she said, “your Royal Highness ----_.”
“That's better, Gamp," said the Rabbit. “You 're learning
manners, I'm glad to notice.”
"If your Royal Highness will deign to grant our request,
and will graciously relate to us the story of the unfortunate
accident by which you were changed from a Prince into a
White Rabbit, your two petitioners will ever pray.”
"Nobody wants you to pray," said the White Rabbit
tartly.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WOMEN I HAVE NEVER MARRIED.
IV.
Well, twenty years or so have gone,
And now I meet her (ah! the pity!),
A puffy matron serving on
The “New Amphitryon Club ” Committee.
O.S.
She was a phantom of delight,
One of those rare elusive things
Detained this side the Ewigkeit
Through temporary want of wings;
Our world was not her proper place,
Rather she seemed a priceless relic
Of Faërieland's enchanted grace,
She was so birdlike, so angelic.
I often wondered what she ate;
She looked as though she lived on air,
Or, if she fed from off a plate,
Would only touch ambrosial fare ;
No man that dealt in butcher's meat
Had ever been allowed to victual
With stuff we common mortals eat
A form so exquisitely brittle.
Such were my views when first I fell,
In salad days still fairly green,
Beneath the spiritual spell
Of my unearthly EMMELINE ;
She had on me a marked effect :
Each moment spent in gazing at her
Tended to make me more select,
And purge my soul of grosser matter.
And yet a fear assailed my mind,
When I reviewed my purposed vows,
Whether a being so refined
Would make a good domestic spouse;
Would she, as fits a faithful wife
(The thought already left me thinner),
Count it her chief concern in life
To see that I enjoyed my dinner?
“WILLIE BRUE'D A PECK”- O' NONSENSE.
Sergeant Brue, a musical farce at the Prince of Wales's
Theatre, plot and libretto by OWEN HALL, with lyrics by J.
H. Wood, music by Madame Liza LEHMANN, and played by
Mr. FRANK Curzon's capital company, having had but an
indifferent start at the Strand Theatre, is now pursuing a
most successful course at the Prince of Wales's. It seems
a pity that an idea so original as this, on which the nonsensical
piece is founded, should not have been dramatically worked
out and artistically developed into a genuine comedy of real
life. “Instead of which," as the magistrate said, its striking
opportunities are frittered away in songs and dances of a well-
known type, and in utterly extravagant yet always amusing
absurdities, where there is always plenty of rhyme but very
little reason. In spite of his extravagances, Mr. Edouin, as the
policeman who has suddenly succeeded to a large property,
keeps up the character throughout, except when he appears
as a most finished dancer, an art in which it is most impro-
bable that a flat-footed, stiff-jointed policeman could ever have
shone.
The First Act, as far as Mr. Edouin's Policeman Brue is
concerned, is a domestic comedy that, but for the nonsensical
singing and dancing, might have been the commencement of
a really good play. Here Mr. Edouin is excellent. And all
the principals who take part in the First Act, which in its
essence is comedy, namely, Mr. FARREN SOUTAR as Brue's son,
Miss OLIVE MORRELL as his daughter, Miss MILLIE LEGARDE as
the scheming lady, Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMS as the detected
thief, and Mr. EDWARD KIPLING as the dry business-like
solicitor, acquit themselves, every one of them, as accom-
plished comedians. They, with WILLIE EDOUIN, have, Willie
nilly, to interrupt their acting by breaking out into utterly
irrelevant song and dance, being thereto compelled by the
force majeure of author, lyricist, and composer.
After this First Act the author lets comedy go by the board,
and, with his talented assistants, making up a sort of band
of Pied Pipers, sets all the company dancing, gambolling,
singing, through three Acts of, it must be admitted, very
entertaining nonsense, into the fun of which the audience
most willingly enter.
Miss MILLIE LEGARDE, as Lady Bickenhall, with songs,
capital imitations (specially of the coon singing), and dances,
is, after Mr. WILLIE EDOUIN, one of the “lifes and souls" of
the piece.
Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMS, giving us another phase of the
tramp, in which he made so marked a hit in The Message
from Mars, delights the audience. His by-play is perfect,
and he is never out of the picture. The audience enjoy
everything done by him and Mr. Edouin, as also, it is evident,
do the actors and actresses.
The music throughout is tuneful and full of go, though
there is a certain sameness in the arrangement of verse and
chorus, which might have been avoided by so clever a
musician as Madame Liza LEHMANN. Mr. SYDNEY BARRACLOUGH
is a pleasing tenor, making the most of a not very effective
song; and the choruses, well sung, with a variety of action,
by the fascinating “girlies” and the sprightly young swells,
are tuneful and full of life.
From first to last the piece, as a “musical farce," is so
lively, so bright, and so entertaining that, with Mr. EDOUIN,
Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMS and Miss MillIE LEGARDE, it will pro-
bably achieve a success far greater, and a run far longer,
than was ever anticipated for it. So mote it be!
She whom (I guessed) a currant bun
Sufficed for hunger's faint appeals---
Would she respect, when we were one,
My prejudice for decent meals ?
Anxious for some assuring sign
To clinch my hesitating passion,
I asked my angel out to dine
At London's first resort of Fashion.
She came. She passed a final word
Upon the bisque, the Mornay sole,
The poulet (said she thought the bird
Shewed at its best en casserole);
She found the parfait “ quite first-rate,”
Summed up the chef as “rather handy,"
Knew the Lafitte for '88,
And twice encored a fine old brandy.
I own I felt an inward pain,
When she put off her seraph airs,
To find I had to entertain
An earthly angel unawares ;
I merely asked her there to test
Her aptness for a wifely calling,
And never dreamed that she possessed
A special knowledge so appalling!
Frankly, she went a shade too far.
It was a shock-I feel it still-
To learn that what I deemed a star
Was just an ember off the grill!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MANUFACTURE OF
PSEUDONYMS.
A NUMBER of distinguished women of
letters reply in the Girls' Realm to the
question, "How did you choose your
pseudonym ?” Never backward in
following an illuminating example, Mr.
Punch has lost no time in subjecting
several leading male representatives of
the corporation of the goosequill to a
similar ordeal.
Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING, who was shoot-
ing clay pigeons in the poultry-yard of
his fine new Tudor mansion when our
representative called, courteously laid
aside his lethal weapon and furnished
the desired information without a
moment's hesitation. “My pseudonym,"
he observed in his bright staccato accents,
“is an amalgam built up out of four
words. The first syllable is taken from
Ruddigore, my favourite opera, while
'yard' indicates my love of ships and
shipping. The first half of my surname
comes from kipper, my favourite fish, the
second from starling, my favourite bird.
Must you go? Then I hope you 'll take
a brace of these pigeons with you."
Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN, writing from
Swinford Old Manor, says: “My
instinctive preference for the trochaic
metre naturally impelled me to choose a
pseudonym which should illustrate my
addiction to that intrepid measure. My
Christian name I borrowed from the
greatest of our Kings, better known of
late years under the affectionate title of
"England's Darling," while the surname
Austin I took after the founder of the
State of Texas, a region which, by the
superb antinomianism of its inhabitants,
has always appealed vividly to my
imagination. It is hardly necessary for

MR. SPEAKER!
EXTRACT FROM THE RECESS DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
I HAVE sometimes wondered what a
Positivist might be. Aiter reading Mr.
FREDERIC HARRISON'S turbulent attack
upon the SPEAKER, I know. A Positivist
would seem to be a man who publishes
violent assertions about subjects of
which he is personally ignorant.
Mr. HARRISON, waking up to find
Parliament prorogued, makes savage
dash at retreating figure of SPEAKER,
incidentally doubling up PRINCE ARTHCR.
Of the latter he prophesies, “He will be
remembered as the Minister who has
dragged down the honour of Statesmen
and the moral standard of public life to
a depth which it (sic) has not reached
since the times of SUNDERLAND or New-
CASTLE.” Of the SPEAKER he shouts :
“The Government secured his conni-
vance in tricking, deceiving, degrading,
and muzzling the House of Commons.
He has sacrificed his character for fair-
ness, and has betrayed the historic
prestige of the Chair."
PRINCE ARTHUR may be left to defend
himself if he thinks it worth while.
Probably he won't. The SPEAKER is
quite another matter. The traditions of
his dignified, judicial office preclude his
entering the arena of personal contro-
versy. As far as House of Commons is
concerned this is, in special circum-
stances of the case, of little consequence.
Through ten long, occasionally troublous,
Sessions it has daily, hourly, watched
Mr. GULLY's conduct in the Chair, has
had repeated occasion to recognise his
absolute freedom not only from party
bias—that happily is a matter of course
in the Chair of the House of Commons-
but from personal prejudice, a victory

There is no public position more diffi-

WOMEN I HAVE NEVER MARRIED.
Though I am not so young as then, .
I still remember rather well
The first (and last) occasion when
I disapproved of ASPHODEL;
But so it is with love at sight
That later on--some idle morning-
In breaks a sudden stream of light
Without the faintest previous warning.
We are so easily misled!
I judged of her by outward looks
As one who would not lose her head
To heroes out of story-books;
Her name, although a little rare,
Lent me no hint that might alarm me,
Nor could I guess her pensive air
Concealed a passion for the Army.
It chanced, upon a dismal day,
We studied photographic views,
Mycenæ's walls--the Appian Way--
The haunt of Umbria's famed recluse;
Was it the cypress, lone and stark,
Standing as sentry o'er Assisi,
That wrung from her this raw remark:
“Wouldn't you love to win the V.C.?”
Somehow it seemed in doubtful taste
That, when I hoped her heart was stirred
By thoughts of how St. Francis traced
Kinship with beast and flower and bird,
Taming his flesh until it shone
With a refined and ghostly pallor --
She should invite opinions on
A copper prize for carnal Valour!
I answered her. My tones were bland,
And yet perhaps the words were hard';
But anyone will understand
About my feelings being jarred ;
I said, “Let nursery-maids adore
A medal sewn on crude vermilion ;
I woo not such, nor ever soar
To virtues other than civilian !”
(Mind you, I like the soldier-class,
I count them modest, frank, and plain;
In their companionship I pass
Moments aloof from mental strain;
But there's a courage which can be
Tested without a bloody quarrel;
This nobler kind occurs in me,
And may be best described as “moral.")
Right through her frame a shudder ran,
And I could read her nature clear,
Hlow she regarded every man
As a potential Volunteer ;
Would urge me forth to take the field
And say--I almost heard her shout it-
“I'd sooner see you on your shield
Than coming home unscathed without it!”
At this my thoughts went back to one
Who from his wisdom dropped this pearl :
Should you propose to wed, my son,
Beware the Guardsman type of girl!
'Twas Heaven revived that warning voice,
And, as I closed our painful session,
I knew that I had made the choice
Of Valour's better part-Discretion! 0. S.
THE WHITE RABBIT:
CHAPTER V.
The White Rabbit finishes his Story.
“I will not,” began the White Rabbit, when his audience
of two had duly assembled on the following morning, “I will
not weary you with all the trifling details of my early
existence. Some things, however, I must mention. On the
day following my birth I was gazetted to the colonelcy of
twenty-five regiments of the Sablonian Army, and at the
same time I was appointed a Vice-Admiral à la suite---"
“What does that mean?” interrupted Rob.
“Something with sugar in it, stupid,” said the Cat. “It's
always given to babies. Good for teething, you know.”
“My good fools,” said the Rabbit testily, “is this story
mine or yours? Am I to be permitted to get a word in
edge-ways? What is the use of displaying your ignorance
in this painful way?”
“Are we to answer all these questions together or
separately ?” asked Rob; “because if-_-"
“Pish,” said the White Rabbit in a tone of contempt, “let
me talk, can't you ? À la suite is, as everyone of ordinary
intelligence knows, the-ah-attribute or-ah-symbol of -
mind, I'm forced into giving these explanations. I didn't want
to humiliate anybody-the-ah-symbol of royalty transferred
to military or naval rank. · Have you grasped it? Well,
then, we can get on. At the same time I was appointed Vice-
Admiral à la suite” (he said this very emphatically) “in the
Royal Sablonian Navy. I was thus from my infancy inured
to the hardships and dangers both of a military and of a
seafaring life, and in this manner I acquired the strength,
the courage, and the dogged endurance which, at a later
period, made my name a household word wherever the flag
of Sablonia has been unfurled. Even now in this condition
of impotent, red-eyed servitude I can think of those days,
and my heart beats higher and the blood courses quicker
through my veins when I recollect the clash of martial music,
the howling of the tempests, the long and weary marches so
patiently endured, the shipwrecks, the dreadful nights of
bivouac, and the fierce death-dealing onset, while the blasts
of the trumpets and the roll of the drums were drowned in
frenzied shouts of victory. But tush-let me resume.
"My baptism was a ceremony of unparalleled magnificence,
all my godfathers being Emperors or Kings. I received the
names of PAUL ALEXANDER VICTOR ATHELSTAN HAROLD JOHN
EDWARD ” “Half time!” said the Cat.
“If you interrupt me again," said the Rabbit, “I shall
have the Court cleared. Understand that, both of you. This
is not a time for small jokes of extremely doubtful relevance.
I received, as I said, the names of PAUL ALEXANDER VICTOR
ATHEISTAN HAROLD JOHN EDWARD HENRY Louis WILLIAM NICHOLAS

glorious future for a babe so numerously named and so dis-
tinguished-if I may say so without conceit-in appearance.

me by the ladies of the Court delighted, while they terrified,
my mother. “I know not,' she used to say, 'whence he
derives his beauty and his powers of fascination. From
his father's side it cannot be. I should be the last to deny
the merits of the Royal House into which I have married, but
among these merits I have never heard that beauty and
fascination could be reckoned.'
"• 'Tis from your own most gracious Majesty's side, no
doubt,' said one of the courtiers.
“I suppose it is even so,' said my mother, 'yet the King,
my spouse, hesitates to recognise the fact.'
"Impossible,' said the courtier, ‘’tis writ large upon the
glorious child's face.'

Little Man. "YES. BUT I DON'T THINK MYSELF SO CLEVER AS I REALLY AM!”
TO A MOSQUITO,
DEBARRED the blood of politicians by
An editor's inexorable fiat;
With wells of inspiration running dry,
And badly needing somebody to shy at,
I turn to thee, small scion of the jungle,
Of thee, elusive beast, this peaceful tongue'll
Make discourse in a mournful threnody.
The air is balmy and the setting sun
Invites repose, when lo! thy puny trumpet
Informs mine ear that thou hast now begun
Thy evening operations on my crumpet ;
From one to other of my classic features
Thou gambolest, О least of little creatures,
Then comes a pause, and lo! the thing is done!
And thou art vanished into empty space :
In vain to paw the palpitating air;
Still more in vain to slap the injured place,
In hopes to crush thee: thou art never there.
Securely cached in some adjacent cranny
Thou smilest on thy labours so uncanny,
And whettest thy proboscis for the chase.
A sudden swoop: an answering scream of pain :
And lo! a strong man writhing on the ground,
Telling, in language fearfully profane,
What fate awaits thee, miscreant, when found.
And thou dost hear with ill-concealed elation
The tortured victim's yells of execration,
And sallying forth dost bite the man again.
The middle-aged, whose depilated crust
Has long been reft of Nature's crowning glory,
Eye thy performances with frank disgust,
And speak of thee in terms profoundly gory;
And when they hear thy reedy 'vox humana
They swathe their apex in a blue bandana,
Intent to dodge thy weapon's frantic thrust.
And solid matrons, whom "those horrid flies"
Have rendered more than usually fussy,
As soon as thou appearest to their eyes
Scatter before thee, screaming "Lawk a mussy."
He only whose intrepid hide is tougher
Than pelt of hippopotam thou dost suffer
To 'scape the dire effects of thine emprise.
The king his crown, the nobleman his crest
Alike thou pinkest with thy rapid passes ;
With equal appetite thou dost infest
The shrinking top-knots of the middle classes.
One comfort only have we: to remember
How summer wanes anon, and cool September
Will shortly wipe thee out, insidious pest!
MR. CRESER, F.R.C.O., Mus. D. (Oxon.), has been visiting

ducted the horns among other orchestral instruments, but
this hardly justifies a Winnipeg newspaper in describing
him as a "musical director of Oxen."

THE POLITICAL ROMANCE.
[“ War is not without its influence even
upon literature .... At this moment the most
popular form of fiction is the romance of
political adventure ..... with a preference
for those of which the scene is laid in Russia."
-Daily Pre88.]
ACTING upon this timely notice the
Editor at once wired to a deservedly
popular author requesting him to fur-
nish immediately a serial on the above
lines. The first instalment (given
below) arrived by return of post, with
an intimation that the remainder would
follow by the next delivery, and that
cheques should be made payable to the
Express Fiction Company, London. We
append the instalment, and invite the
verdict of our readers as to its continu-
ance.
PROLOGUE.
A reception was in progress at the
house of His Excellency the Muscovite
Ambassador to the Court of St. James.
At midnight the crush was overpower-
ing, and as a consequence the magnifi-
cent salons were almost uncomfortably
crowded with Princes, Diplomatists,
Adventuresses, and a sprinkling of elderly
noblemen, who provided the appropriate
comic relief to an atmosphere already
opaque with intrigue and sentiment.
Leaning idly against a marble pillar,
the tall figure of Sir JOHN BULLENER,
Bart., surveyed the dazzling scene with
eyes that seemed almost contemptuously
indifferent to the splendour that sur-
rounded him. An idle man this, you
would say, one of the spoilt children of
fortune, whom it would be difficult to
stir from his habitual lethargy. Per-
haps, but it may be also that very little
in life escaped the scrutiny of those
listless eyes, and perhaps too their
owner, once roused, was one who could
be relied upon for as many adventures

BAD NEWS FOR VILLADOM.
THE Urban District Council of Hands-
worth, near Birmingham, has decided
that houses in future must be identified
by numbers, and not merely designated
by high-sounding names. We have en-
deavoured (but, we must confess, with
very indifferent success) to trace the
origin and meaning of some of these
picturesque appellations, which add
such zest and delight to the explora-
tions of cabmen, postmen, and stray
visitors in general. “ Bellevue,” it
appears, is the most popular, and may
be counted by thousands with its
variants of “Fairview” and “Bella
Vista.” The reasons for the title are
usually that the villa in question is so
insignificant, and the rent so low, that the
owner has to concentrate attention upon
his outlook, for which latter he draws
upon your imagination, on account of
the “houses in between.” “The Elms,”
“The Firs,” “The Laburnums," and
“The Laurels” run it close. They are
interesting applications of the lucus a
non lucendo principle, and of the
occupant's ambition to possess a grove,
or at least one or two of such trees,
in his ten square feet of front garden.
Then the large “ Dene” tribe seem to
possess a fatal attraction for house-
holders of romantic aspirations but in-
definite ideas. They enter into various
combinations, “Rosedene,” “Willow
Dene” and “Moss Dene" ranking high
in favour. “Holme,” “Hurst,” “Croft”
and “Grange” run them close as ter-
minations, and indicate an income of
£2 10s. per week, and an inability to
explain their exact meaning. Other

The race of the season is over ;
I've lost and DIANA has won ;
She's feasting on BROADACRES' clover,
And I am right out of the fun.
Though Di was the one to begin it,
She soon found me making the pace;
I thought all along I should win it,
And only backed her for a place.
At Ascot DIANA was leading;
At Henley I spurted ahead;
At Cowes side by side we were speeding;
At Trouville I fancy I led.
Neck to neck we ran, shoulder to

The pace was too killing to last-
(If the weather had only been colder!)
I flagged, and Diana shot past.
My heart 's not by any means broken;
I hope I'm not wanting in pluck;

DRAMA BY INSTALMENTS.
ENCOURAGED by the example of Messrs.
R. N. STEPHENS and E. LYALL SWETE in
adding a prologue to Miss Elizabeth's
Prisoner, after that play had enjoyed a
successful run of several months, we
have reason to believe that a similar
instalment-system is shortly to be applied
to other pieces of established reputation.
The following paragraphs are anticipated
from a “Drama of the Day" article
which has not yet appeared in the Daily
Telegraph.
Additional interest was lent last even-
ing to the superb revival of Hamlet, now
occupying the stage of the Upper Tooting
Theatre, by the fact that it was preceded,
for the first time, by a new prologue,
the scene of which is laid at Elsinore
about three months before the commence-
ment of the actual play, and which, as a
medium for the display of some excellent
acting, proved greatly to the taste of the
audience. As Hamlet, Sen., reigning
King of Denmark, Mr. Jones fully con-
firmed the good impression he had already
made when confined to the spectral
appearances of that unfortunate monarch.
His delivery of a fine passage, in which
the crime of Gertrude and her accomplice
is foreshadowed, beginning :
“Methought a spider pricked mine ear last night,
So sharp it ached i' the niorning — ”.
reached a high level of dramatic sugges-
tiveness. A further happy inspiration was
the introduction of Yorick, who, it will be
remembered, is unfortunately deceased
at the date of the tragedy as usually
performed, thus sacrificing some much
needed comic relief. It is pleasant to
record that Mr. D. LENO, as the “ fellow
of infinite jest,” fully sustained his
reputation for keeping his hearers “on

THE POLITE PILFERER.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,- If you have an eye
to spare from the other affairs of the
world, will you kindly run it over the
following extract from the Express :
"A boy who wanted apples and stole them
had an interesting theory propounded for him
at Brentford. 'Why,' said the magistrate,
didn't you go to the owner and say, "I have
an idea of getting into your orchard during the
night. I don't want to do so. I like the look
of your apples. Give me two or three !” You
would probably have been successful. Now
you will have to pay 58.'”.
I see an opening here for a work I have
long contemplated, “Every Criminal's
Guide to Courtesy," with the sub-title,
“ Tips for Thieves and Deportment for
Desperados.” The book will be made
up of specimen conversations to suit
every occasion. The criminal who buys
the volume need never fear those awkward
pauses which so frequently occur when
one is caught in the act of a burglary or
murder.
I append a sample. We will suppose,
for instance, that a burglar wishes to
abstract some plate from a house. He
enters the owner's bedroom-window and
the following dialogue takes place :-

The Ancient Order of Hibernians at
Paterson, New Jersey, having unani-
mously resolved “to boycott all theatres,
concerts, and music-halls where the
Irishman is caricatured,” a mass Meet-
ing of eminent Irishmen was convened
in London to determine whether or not
to follow suit.
The Meeting was held in the Rotunda,
Turnham Green, the chair being taken
by the Drum-Major of the Kilties (height
7 feet, weight 275 lbs.). Among those
present were Col. SAUNDERSON, M.P., Mr.
Lloyd-GEORGE, M.P., Mr. SWIFT MACNEILL,
M.P., Mr. G. BERNARD SHAW, Mr. I.
ZANGWILL, Mr. A. W. PINERO, Mr. GEORGE
MOORE, and Mr. W. B. YEATS.
The CHAIRMAN, before making his
introductory speech, proceeded to read
in rich Canadian Doric several letters
from absent sympathisers.
Mr. Kipling, writing from the Canary
Islands, said that Terence Mulvaney was
drawn faithfully from life. Rather than
hear him called a caricature, the writer
was prepared to listen to the music of
OFFENBACH. He did not know who it
was who said that he preferred BACH
often to OFFENBACH, but, whoever it was,
he deserved a statue.

The bait took at once.
“Yes,” cried the eminent statesman,
"you must follow him, track him down
at all hazards and all costs, and save
him from danger, possibly disgrace.”
He blew his nose noisily to hide his
emotion, thrust a great rouleau of notes
into my hand, lit a choice Borneo cigar, and
rushed hastily from the breakfast parlour.
At 11 P.m. that night, disguised in the
corduroys of the assistant gardener,
whom I had drugged and safely deposited
in the melon frame, I was ensconced in
the inner orchid house at Highbury,
waiting for the dawn. There was a great
athletic meeting at Wolverhampton the
next day, and I had drawn my own
deductions.
Two and then three chimed from the
neighbouring church tower before I
heard the sound of a key grating in the
lock, and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN stole into the
orchid house. He was simply clad in
a suit of purple pyjamas, with the
mayoral chain gracefully slung round
his neck. In one hand he carried a
suit-case, and in the other a dark lantern.
He had come to take a glimpse at his
beloved flowers before starting for
Wolverhampton.
“What are you doing in my orchid

gleam in his eye.

The triumph of old-fashioned farce, farce pure and simple
---farce thoroughly English, owing nothing to any French or
German original---has been re-established by the genuine
success of Mr. JACOBS' Beauty and the Barge, put into
dramatic form by Louis N. PARKER, and played at the New
Theatre for all it is worth (and this will amount to a tidy
sum at the end of the long run that may with safety be
predicted for it) by Mr. CYRIL MAUDE and the first-rate
company he has got together for this particular work. Mr.
Cyril MAUDE, admirably made up, impersonates the elderly, gay,
seductive, ready-witted Captain James Barley, of the barge

the absolute correctness of Mr. Jacobs' portraiture of a class,
with which it is unlikely that one in a hundred among the
audience is so thoroughly acquainted as to be able to claim the
right of special and particular criticism. Never having met a
Captain James Barley, I can only express my confidence in
Mr. JACOBS' description and CYRIL MAUDE's impersonation
of him as together constituting a faithful picture of a real
existing type, just as much as were Cap'en Cuttle and Jack
Bunsby, whom we accept on the authority of CHARLES
DICKENS. In representing this superior Bargee Mr. Cyril

well-stocked gallery of dramatic characters.

dialogue and action have to be taken, would be fatal to a

from first to last. This is also true of the second pair of lovers,

DEAR ELIZA,—Whitechapel is begin-
ning to fill up again, and several parties
are already back from the hop-picking.
One of the first to arrive was Mr. HENRY
HAWKINS, whom I saw in the New Cut
yesterday, looking very well and brown.
He told me that hops have been very
plentiful this year, and that his party
got several excellent bags.
I also ran across Mr. “BILL ” Sykes in
the neighbourhood of Bow Street a day
or two ago, but we were not able to
speak to one another. He was fresh
back from a hurried visit to Lady VERE
DE VERE's mansion. where he had been
inspecting some old silver. You know
he has a perfect passion for it. It seems,
however, that he was only passing
through town, and left that same even-
ing for Pentonville, where he expects to
make a protracted stay. By the way,
they tell me that hair is being worn
rather short there just now.
Saturday last was a very busy day.
In the afternoon there were the usual
Hampstead Races, which were attended
by an exceptionally brilliant crowd.
Mr. “PET” HOGGINS tooled down a large
party in his smart turn-out, and subse-
quently his gallant steed carried him to
victory in the Hampstead Cup amid
scenes of immense enthusiasm. 'After a
recherché tea at a neighbouring winkle
stall, his whole party hurried back to a
delightful al fresco dance in Hopper's

was supplied by Signor BARRELLI ORGANO

LINES WRITTEN IN A STORM AT SEA.
RACKED by destroying thirst and tearing spasm,
Packed insecurely on a heaving shelf,
Nothing to do but mourn my inner chasm,
And lie and hate myself,—
The sounding rusk too fugitive a diet,
The placid tea a beverage too shy
To stay the vacuum (will you be quiet ?
Couldn't you even try ?) -
Torn by the nauseating “corkscrew motion,”
Groaning anew with every heave and dip,
After three days and nights, I ask you, OCEAN,
Is this a pleasure trip?
Give me a bay as flat as tepid gravy,
A boat to loaf in, and a decent pipe,
And I could almost wish I'd joined the Navy;
I feel I'm just that type.
Give me a pier, and let explosive bandsmen
Bray “Rule, Britannia” to the twinkling stars,
I think, how petty are the lives of landsmen,
How jovial those of tars!
Let me ascend a cliff where I can smell you,
And watch your wild waves beating down below,
And (oh, good gracious! Woa, oh, woa, I tell you !
Confound it, will you woa ?)
But now I came for rest and recreation,
To breathe the ozone and admire the view;
Is this refreshment, this recuperation ?
Go to, I say, go to!
How can I take a pleasure in the scenery,
How can I reap a profit from the brine,
If you start interfering with machinery
As delicate as mine?
Yet there are men whom nothing seems to flummox,
Men that can ride a gale without a care,
Absorb their viands with triumphant stomachs,
And never turn a hair.
I hate them. Their exasperating bonhomie
Gives me offence. They have a haughty trick
Of praising their interior economy,
Which stings me to the quick.
Then, OCEAN, hear me. Deeply though I suffer,
Though I have borne enough to drive one mad,
If you could bring them down by getting rougher,
I wish you would, begad.
Their groans would fall upon mine ears like music,
'Twould be the next best thing to being cured
If I could cry, “Ha, ha, my friends, are you sick ?”
It would, I feel assured.

[OCTOBER 19, 1904.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MODERN MOLOCH.
[Mr. LLOYD-GEORGE has conceived the inspired idea of closing all the
elementary schools in Wales as a protest against the Education Act.
This will mean that, unless a very large sum of money is subscribed by
certain sectarian bodies that have never been conspicuous by the
generosity of their private contributions to education, the children will
be left to their own devices, without any training, spiritual or secular.
--The Outlooker.
MERE simple babes that barely know
The way to write or read-
Why should they care one paltry blow
For “Liberty of Creed”!
In any case I saw with pain
That boy of Celtic blood
Rejoin his mates and turn again
To wallowing in the mud.
I left them. I was much annoyed ;
Yea, something in my gorge
Rose up against this person, LLOYD,
Whose other name was GEORGE.
What have they done to him, I thought,
Him and his Christian friends,
That they should go unwatched, untaught,
To suit his party's ends.
And like a horrid furnace-blast
The hideous memory came
Of heathen rites, and children “ passed
To Moloch through the flame.”
I thought: "The self-same sacrifice
Still serves the monster's greed;
The blood of babes is still his price,
Only he takes the new device
Of 'Liberty of Creed.' ” 0. S.
I met a little Cymric lad;
Among his mates at play
He tossed with halfpennies and had
An air of holiday.
His clothes were soiled, his face was black,
His speech—it hurt me sore
To mark its almost total lack
Of elemental lore.
“My boy, inform me why,” I said,
“You waste the shining hours,
When you should be at school instead,
Training your youthful powers ?
“You do yourself a grievous wrong
To gamble thus outside!”
“ They've shut 'em up; it's all along
O'LLOYD,” the youth replied.
“Tell me,” I said, “my little man,
Who might this fellow be,
That sets an arbitrary ban
Upon your A. B. C.?
“In other words I want to know
Who is this Mr. LLOYD
Who lets your little talents go
To swell the unemployed.”
His voice with sudden laughter rang:
“Well, you 're a bit behind !
It's him as says the clergy gang
Corrup's the infant mind!
“Not heard o' GEORGE? Well, you ’re a treat!
Why, he's the bloomin' boss ;
He turns us loose about the street
A-playing pitch an' toss.
“ He'd have the Bible taught his way,
Or show 'em what was what;
That's how there ain't no schools to-day;
He s been an' shut the lot!”
“Dear babe,” I cried, "your Mr. LLOYD
Who takes this lofty line-
Is his behaviour wholly void
Of partisan design?
“Considering well what things are done
To influence the polls,
Think you his aim was pure and one-
To save your little souls ? "
No answer came. I could not tell
Whether the boy deplored
My doubts respecting Mr. L.,
Or just was feeling bored.
MY FIRST PANTO.
(With acknowledgments to the “Review of Reviews.")
THERE! I told you I'd do it, and now I've done it. I've
really been at last. I've been to the Panto.
I will first very simply tell you what it is.
The Panto is a Remarkable Rehabilitation of Current
Political Events. At least, that is what it seemed to me.
Every little incident suggested some enormous problem of
the day. I really have got an extraordinary brain.
I will now tell you all about it.
Remember, I went with the simple virgin mind of a man
of eighty-five. Beneath my right arm I carried one of my
“Books for the Bairns,” containing the whole delightful
story; beneath the other a white woollen comforter in case
lit was cold when coming out.
Outside the Pit door stood a long row of people. A con-
stable was employed in keeping them very close together,
which they seemed to resent. It was the desire for Home
Rule over again. I took my place. A man stood on one side
of me, and on the other side stood another man. I had
never experienced anything like it before.
Presently a negro who had been singing came down the
row collecting money. A scandalous imposition which im-
mediately recalled AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN and the Income-tax.
Halting before me the individual put a very curious ques-
tion: “Does your mother," he said, “know that you are
out?” I at once gave him a halfpenny, which, rather to my
surprise, he said he would invest in Consols. A remarkable
sign of the national spirit of Thrift, engendered, doubtless,
by fear that Jingo Joe's tariff may come into force.
At that moment the doors opened. They opened on hinges
very like ordinary doors. At the place set apart for that
purpose I handed in two separate shillings, a threepenny-bit
and three coppers, and asked for a front seat. The man at
once desired to know who I was getting at. I said I was
getting up my circulation by going into the Pit. Like a
flash he put the question : “Does your mother know you 're
out?” This is evidently some secret sign. Socialism and
the Hard Winter came vividly to my mind, and, puzzling
over it, I passed into the Pit.
The Pit contained benches stretching from one end to the
other end. I was given a programme with the characters
of the play printed on it in print. From an attendant I pur-
chased for one penny a packet of acid tablets. I could, had

II.—THE GOSPEL OF BIGNESS.
I WONDER how many of the myriads who have been con-
vulsed by the rich humour of the opening chapters of Mr.
H. G. WELLS's romance have penetrated the true inwardness
of the soul-shaking parable of its final phases—how many, i
I mean, have realised the deep spiritual fervour that underlies
the saucy exuberance of the Sage of Sandgate! To me there
are few things more ineffably pitiful than that HERBERT WELLS,
mystic and magician, whose 'austere lineaments recall the
aureoled saints of FRA ANGELICO, while his tangled elf-locks
proclaim his affinity to ROGER BACON, LAMBLICHUS and CASABIANCA,
should be regarded by the heedless Philistine as a harlequin
of pseudo-science, and not as the SAVONAROLA of our day!
For let us ponder the real meaning of his new romance,
and it will become painfully clear to all but the veriest
dullards that HERBERT WELLS proclaims to all men in trumpet
tones that it is their duty to become great as well as good.
In this unique pronunciamento he reveals himself not only
as the superb moral teacher but as the true son of an age
which at all points seeks to obliterate and annihilate littleness,
and to emphasise the virtue of mammoth dimensions.
Wherever we turn we are confronted by evidences of this
cult of bigness. In literature we see the band of patient
sleepless eremites under their heroic chief Dr. MURRAY, slowly
rearing the colossal fabric of the New Oxford Dictionary.
In music there is the drum-major of the Kilties, to say nothing

in progress that I noticed a curious
undulatory movement in the long
draperies which divided the side-shows
from the central hall. I glanced at
Mr. BOLTER for an explanation, and was
surprised to see that the perspiration
was rolling down his face-which had
assumed a greenish hue-in great beads.
I heard queer scuffling noises all round,
a squeak or two, and Mr. PARSONS, the
muscular curate, with his spectacles on
and his coat off, appeared at an opening
beckoning two gentlemen, who hastened
behind the hangings. The hymn trailed
weakly to its conclusion. I pronounced
the Bazaar open to a singularly inatten-
tive audience, and prepared to make the
orthodox tour of the stalls. But some-
how or other my lavish purchases fell
flat; the stall-holders seemed more in-
terested in the draperies round their
stalls than the pretty display on the top,
and one lady to my surprise insisted on
standing on a chair. REGGIE was nowhere
to be seen, and this disturbed me, for it

It was while I was buying an ugly

Rob had been admitted to her sacred
room, nay more, had been actually sent
for, while he, with all his love and
devotion, was kept outside in his solitary

decisively. “She didn't even hint at it.

I might manage to lead the conversation

“You needn't trouble yourself,” said
the Rabbit. “She'll send for me of
her own accord if she wants me.”
At this moment the gardener's boy
appeared, and Gamp, who had for him
a rooted objection based on the throwing
of stones, disappeared into the bushes.
“Come along, Red-eyes,” said the
boy as he opened the hutch and seized
the Rabbit by the ears, “I've got to
take you into the house. Miss MABEL 's
asked for you.”
“At last!” whispered Bunbutter in
triumph to himself. At last he was to
be admitted to MABEL's own room. She
had asked for him. Wouldn't he swagger

again! Even as he was carried along

SYMBOLIC BOOTS.
We have heard much of late years
concerning the Degeneracy of the Drama.
Careful research has been made for a
remedy, and now recent events have
encouraged the belief in aid from the
outside. Where our dramatists have
failed to express emotion and the
development of character, our modistes
have stepped in and supplied a long-
felt want. And why not our boot-
makers too ?
Appended are a few ideas for the con-
struction of a Four-Act play, in which
the desired symbolism is furnished by
the foot-gear of the protagonist.
Act I.
The hero wears a pair of flamboyant
yellow boots, expressive of youthfulness
and hopefulness. A neat and happy
combination of red buttons is symbolical
of his dawning passion for a charming
lady possessed of a husband addicted to
heart disease. But the top inside lining
of the boots is of black leather! This
subtle touch (it will be easy for the
dramatist to write in a few lines enabling
the hero to exhibit the inside lining of
one boot at least during the course of
the Act) is intended to convey to the
audience that the hero is suffering from
a temptation to stage-manage for the
heart-diseaseful husband a “short sharp
shock,” which shall at once carry him
off and enable the hero to do the same
by the lady.
Act II.
The hero wears dead black leather
boots, with all the polish rubbed off.
He is about to assist at the husband's
demise, and therefore wears mourning
in anticipation. A bright red tag
banging out from each boot indicates
that the victim's death is to be accom-
panied with violence.
Act III.
The hero wears a pair of obfusc carpet
slippers, somewhat down-trodden in the I THOMAS MANBANK

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CASE OF MR. B.
PROFESSOR I. O. Uwins, the Secretary
of the Free Loaf Commission, has kindly
forwarded us the following interesting
summary of the reports issued by the
medico-legal experts called in by the
Commission to examine abnormal cases
of cerebral divagation produced by the
stress of the recent fiscal controversy.
In accordance with the rules laid down
by the Commission, and to prevent any
awkwardness arising from publicity, the
names of the experts are withheld and
that of their subjects indicated solely by
an initial. The present reports are
entirely concerned with a person who,
for the reasons just mentioned, is known
by the simple appellation of Mr. B.
It appears that the first examination
of Mr. B. was made in April, 1903. The
experts were able to state their convic-
tion that there was a serious deficiency
of the fiscal sense, but they asked for a
delay of six months in order to keep
their patient under observation. In
November, 1903, they sent in a further
report. In the interim a variety of
peculiar and conflicting symptoms had
declared themselves. The experts declare
that Mr. B. had temporarily abandoned
his tastes for healthy out-door recreation,
psychical research, novel reading, and
classical concerts. He had developed a
curious partiality for loud and noisy
music, in which instruments of percussion
predominated; he had become a victim
to the craze for rapid travelling in motor
cars, alleging as his reason that only
thus could one approximate to the ideal
condition of being in two places at the
same time; he had come to exhibit an
antipathy towards several of his colleagues
and indulged in clandestine correspon-
dence with others; he deliberately
studied the most obscure and unintel-
ligible philosophers, while his whole
conduct was dominated by a desire to
mystify his oldest friends and most
devoted admirers.

First the right foot is raised and planted
firmly and squarely in front of the other,

with the left foot. In this way no little

found to clear all before it. A variety
of this is
THE SUBURBAN BEAT.
The same-sized boots are retained, but
the leather soles are exchanged for india-

gram, Berlin, November 2.]
He prayeth best who loveth best
All things both great and small,
For the dear God, who loveth us,
He made and loveth all.-S. T. COLERIDGE.
HARK! the woods are awake to-day
With a “horridoh!” With a “horridoh!”
Out and about and far away
The cry of the hunt rings bright and gay,
With a “horridoh!” and a “horridoh!”
Clear and loud, or echoing low.
The foresters, each at his post, stand keen ;
Their hats are green and their coats are green;
Their belts are hung with a hunting-knife
To the honour and praise of the Lord of life.
And the sun strikes down through the tall old trees,
The oak and the beech and the darkling firs;
And the breath of the green-coat foresters
Goes out in smoke on the autumn breeze,
As they stand with hardly a moment's ease,
Or stealthily moving watch the ground
Till the marks of the quarry's flight be found.
They know that the beasts the forests hide,
The russet stag in his antlered pride,
With his wonderful eyes so calm and clear,
And his ears intent for the sounds of fear;
And the shaggy old grunting crook-tusked boar,
A terrible fellow to rip and gore,
And everything else that moves and breathcs
Are meant for the knives in the leather sheaths.
But first they are driven and tracked and bayed,
The beasts the bountiful Lord has made,
Tracked to the sound of the winding horn,
Tracked and driven and bayed and torn,
With a “horridoh!” and a “horridoh!”
Shattered with shot and made to die
With a “horridoh!” With a “horridoh !”
It's a merry hunt and a gallant show-
To the glory and praise of the Lord most high.
For this they know, and full well they know
(The Kaiser himself has said it plain,
With a stamp and a shout of “horridoh !")
That all things living shall suffer pain,
And be robbed of the life that the good Lord gave thera,
With never a hand to soothe or save them;
That he who kills them is thus made greater,
For in killing he honours the beast's Creator.
But where is the antlered stag to-night?
The stag they have failed to kill outright?
For, oh, that stag was a woful sight.
The shot rang out and the shot went true,
But he bounded away and was lost to view ;
And only the startled birds could mark,
As the sun went down and the day fell dark---
Oh where were the shouts of “horridoh!”?..-
How first he stumbled, his head hung low,
And then dropped down with a sob, and so
Quivered and lay, while his life's red tide
Slowly ebbed from his wounded side.
Long he lay, till his eyes grew dim,
And the Lord in His mercy pitied him,
And took, nor thought of the honour paid,
The beautiful buoyant life He made.

[NOVEMBER 9, 1904.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO DELIA, BRIDGE EXPERT.
My Delia, how the days have gone
Since I, in Cupid's constant thrall,
Considered every goose a swan,
And you the swanliest of them all !
The thing you did was always right;
About your simplest act or motion
Lingered the iridescent light
That never was on land or ocean.
Once, it is true, I thought I traced
A hint of something less refined ;
It turned upon a point of taste :-
I asked your hand and you declined ;
Still “ Youth,” I urged, “is seldom wise,
It needs to undergo correction ;
Some day she'll come to recognise
The loss entailed by this rejection.”
But now I thank the kindly Fate
Which in the mask of Wounded Love
Left me, just then, disconsolate
Owing to treatment as above;
For you have lost your maiden dower;
You are a Woman in the Fashion,
And Bridge, from fevered hour to hour,
Is now your one and wasting passion.
We meet at dinner: you are pale ;
An odour on the ambient air
Of club tobacco, pungent, stale,
Steals from your loosely ordered hair ;
I note the vacant eyes that show
Their circling tell-tale lines of sable,
The restless hands that move as though
They sought the little green-cloth table.
My gayest sallies seem to irk
Your absent mind. You eat as one
Who gathers strength for serious work
That waits her when the meal is done ;
At last your hostess leads the way,
Bidding curtail our port and prattle,
And lo! you prick your ears and neighi
Like a war-mare that scents the battle.
We follow where the cards are spread;
I mark your animated mien,
Your face a little flushed with red,
Your eye perhaps a thought too keen.
Alert to seize the subtlest clues,
Bold in assault, a stout defender-
If you could only bear to lose
You might be almost any gender !
Yet, as I watch you play the game
That “gives to life its only zest”
(Life, as you understand the same),
Indeed you hardly look your best;
Missing the cool detached repose
That ought to stamp your cast of features,
You miss the charm that Woman throws
Over us men and lower creatures.
There is a thought I will adapt
From someone else's wisdom's wealth
(A polished orator, and apt
To toast aloud the Ladies' health)
In proof how low your lapse must be
From what a start to what a sequel :
You once were worth ten score of me,
And now, I count you scarce my equal.
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS.
["The Russian Government undertakes that precautions will be
taken to guard against the recurrence of such incidents. Special
instructions for this object will be issued."- Mr. Balfour at Southamp-
ton.]
OUR special correspondent at St. Petersburg sends us
an advance copy, communicated to him by Prince Thik-
SKINSKI, of the special instructions referred to by Mr. BALFOU'R.
The document as a whole is too long for publication, but
the following extracts will give an idea of the severe
restrictions to be imposed henceforth upon the Baltic Fleet.
Art. V.-Atlantic liners, plying between Genoa, Naples,
and British or American ports, sometimes traverse the
Mediterranean Sea in the performance of a part of their
voyage. In the present circumstances, when the feeling
against belligerent vessels is unduly excited, it is an act of
international comity not to fire on these liners unless they
wilfully get within range.
Art. XI.-If a merchant vessel be hit by Russian pro-
jectiles below the water-line, and appear to be in difficulties,
the Admiral is authorised, unless he be pressed for time, to
send boats for the rescue of a reasonable number of survivors.
Art. XII.-Subjects or citizens of neutral Powers, who
have been precipitated into the sea in accordance with the
dictates of the Admiral's conscience, may be informed by
megaphone that he could not have acted otherwise even in
time of profound peace. This information, in order to have
its due effect, should be conveyed in as many languages as
possible before the temporary survivors disappear below the
surface.
Art. XIX.- Pleasure boats, which are also called yachts,
have been known to carry cannon, ostensibly for the purpose
of firing salutes. Before being sunk these yachts may be
allowed to prove that the so-called cannon are not in reality
torpedo-tubes.
Art. XXVI.-Should the Fleet, in one of those deviations
from its course to which the most competent navigating
officers are liable, find itself in the vicinity of the West Indies,
due caution should be exercised in discriminating between
the large Havana cigars so frequently encountered in these

MANY persons think that the punishment of allowing the
Russians to go on to meet the Japanese is more severe than
the occasion warrants.
The Russians' contention that they never aimed at our
trawlers is certainly borne out by the fact that some of them
were hit.
Prince OBOLENSKI has declared to a correspondent of the
Petit Journal his firm conviction that his friend Admiral
ROJDESTVENSKY saw exactly what he said he saw. This view
is backed up by the reports of the Danish pilots, who state
that they noticed a large amount of champagne and vodka on
board the Russian vessels.
One of our contemporaries was much affected by the sight
of what it termed “The Lion lying down with the Bear."
As a matter of fact the Bear was the only one that was lying.

In a report on the examination of

The fact that the Weekly Summary

We have fought the fight of freedom for the masses,
We have won a hundred triumphs in the past,
Till the Upper Ten, assembled
In their marbled halls, have trembled
At the echo of The Clarion's silver blast.
We refused to differentiate the classes
By distinctions which are nothing but a fluke,
And our very souls have revelled
When we saw them fairly levelled,
And the waiter being taken for the Duke.
But the forces of reaction re-awaken,
And the Dukes are on the war-path once again;
They resent to seem no greater
Than the ordinary waiter,
They are wild to find their glories on the wane.
They have sworn an end to trousers; they have shaken
Both the pillars of democracy, and swear,
Though there's nothing else to show them,
By their breeches ye shall know them,
For they 'll swagger in the costliest of wear.
Shall we take it lying down? Are we to suffer,
And without a word of murmuring endure
While the vulgar man of riches
Flaunts his silk and satin breeches
In the faces of the humbly-trousered poor?
O my brothers, it is clear to any duffer
Aristocracy is hatching some vile plot.
Let us raise our ancient war-cry,
And as in the days of yore cry-
Banish breeches, brothers ! Vivent les Sans-culottes !
In the blessed state of nature men are brothers,
Every one of them as good as all the rest,
And the mighty empire-maker
Is no better than the baker-
Each is just a straddling radish till he's drest.
'Tis in clothes that one man differs from the others,
And we thought the day of tyranny was done,
For in evening dress at present
Who can pick out peer from peasant ?
Prince and pauper in their swallow-tails are one.
The Kilties. This band having achieved popularity, the
question as to whether they are to be included in any concert
takes the form of “Kiltie or not Kiltie?” and a jury of

Lady Bird to the Rev. Cæsar Dear.
MY DEAR RECTOR, I am exceedingly
sorry, but the responsibility of this
concert has worn me to such an extent
that Sir JULIAN insists on our leaving
at once for the Riviera. Ever since the
discovery of that unfortunate slip of
yours in the date I have felt the strain.
I am one of those who cannot take
things lightly. I am either all fire or
quite cold. I have been all fire for
your concert and its dear charitable
object, and the result is that I am worn
out, consumed. Wreck, though, that
I am, I would persevere with it to the
end if Sir JULIAN would allow it; but he
is a rock. I therefore enclose all the
correspondence on the subject, which
will show you how the case stands, and
make it very easy for you to complete
the arrangements. All the hard work
is done.
Believe me, with all good wishes, yours
sincerely,

SONE USEFUL RECIPES.
Just as the continuous perusal of a
serious author is found to promote
sleepiness, so the judicious jumping
from grave to gay will stave off the
insidious overtures of Morpheus. Per-
sonally I have derived great benefit
from reading a page of HERBERT SPENCER,
then a page of Mrs. Beeton's Cookery
Book, then a page of Bradshau', and so

blood may be taken from the feet to the

ice and placing a mustard plaster on the

produced by filling the mouth with
capsicums, stinging nettles or red pepper.
A jellyfish has in it a certain invigorat-
ing quality ; so, I believe, has the sea-
urchin. Some prefer such things raw ;
others like them curried. Here is a
recipe that might be good for most
people, but if anyone feels that it would
be improved by the presence of an onion,
he can easily add it :
“Cut off the heads of half a dozen
Tandstickor matches, place them in a pan

EXTRACT FROM THE RECESS DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
BEEN reading Fifty Years of Fleet
Street, just issued by MACMILLAN. Pur-
ports to be the “Life and Recollections
of Sir JOHN ROBINSON,” the man who
made, and for a quarter of a century
maintained at high level, the Daily
News. The story is written by Mr. F.
M. THOMAS, who has added a new terror
to death. There are biographies of
sorts, ranging in value with the
personality of the subject and the skill
of the compiler. The former occasionally
suffers from the incapacity of the latter.
But at least his individuality is scrupu-
lously observed. Like Don José, what
he has said he has said, his observations
and written memoranda not being mixed
up with what his biographer thinks he
himself thought, uttered and recorded.
Mr. THOMAS goes about the biogra-
pher's business in fresh fashion, com-
placently announced by way of intro-
duction to the volume. “I have not
thought it necessary or desirable,” he
writes, “to indicate in all cases what
is his (Sir JOHN ROBINSON'S) and what is
my own. If there is anything amusing
or entertaining in these pages, I am
quite content that my dear old Chief
should have the credit of it. The dul-
ness I take upon myself.”
Here be generosity! Here magna-
nimity! It is true that in the perform-
ance of his task Mr. THOMAS occasionally
falls from this high estate. More than
once he airily alludes to “our diary”
and “our notes," as if he had prepared
them in collaboration with his chief.

THE COMPLETE DOCTOR.
[Vide the recently published Confessions of an
English Doctor.]
My friends, by every means you can,
Avoid the life of the medicine man.
His lot in a vale of woe is thrown
With never a minute to call his own.'
As soon as he closes his weary eyes
Some inconsiderate patient dies,
And inconsiderate babes are born
When he creeps to bed in the grey of
morn ;
By night and day he is slave and thrall
To every pauper that bids him call.
But if, no matter what I may say,
You still persist in your wilful way,
A hint or two from one who knows
May lighten your self-inflicted woes.
Be youth and youthful ways forgot ;
Assume an age if you have it not.
Try to look prosperous, plump and
porty--
Medical men are young at forty.
The working-man with anxious care
Sprinkles with tea his grizzling hair;
All traces of youthfulness you must hide
With a little potassium cyanide.
As youth must be carefully kept from
view,
So ignorance ought to be hidden too.
Judicious deception will do far more
Than all your Æsculapian lore.
Your power is gone when a man supposes
You have a doubt of your diagnosis.
In your innermost heart you may feel at
sea--
If it's mumps, or measles, or housemaid's
knee -
But once let your victim perceive your
trouble,
And the fount of his faith will cease to
bubble.
There may be doctors, I do not doubt,

"TIT-BITS” AND THE “CUARDIAN.”
(We are requested to give an emphatic denial
to the genuineness of the following correspond-
ence.]
From the Editor of the “Guardian" to
the Proprietor of “The Westminster
Gazette," "Strand Magazine," dc.
DEAR Sir George NEWNES,—I feel I
can rely upon having a part of the
ample space at your command to correct
a misapprehension. You say in Mon-
day's Westminster Gazette that my pur-
chase of Tit-Bits will issue in its radical
transformation — that Tit Bits, to use
your own verb, will be “Guardianised."
This is so far from the truth, and may
disappoint so many persons, misled into
the hope of reading henceforth two
Guardians instead of one, that I hasten
to disclose my plans in words which,
unlike a classic, will require no com-
mentary.
In typography and the quality of
paper employed Tit-Bits will be abso-
lutely unaltered. The prizes offered, in
respect both of value and character, will
be neither increased nor diminished.
Nor shall I abandon that philosophic
principle which has been visible from
first to last in the conduct of this mis-
understood publication. You and I
know what that principle is : for the
benefit of others, who may have looked
only superficially at this subject, it may
not be superfluous to say that Tit-Bits
was founded, and has since been con-
tinued, with the object of fostering that
power of dissociation of ideas which is
of the first importance in education, as
any competent teacher of psychology will
agree.
It is therefore exact to say that in
essential principle and in outward form
Tit-Bits will be what it has been. The
only changes I intend to make are in
the staff. May I take our forthcoming
number as an example of what I mean?

perhaps be better not to proceed in my
request that you should honour our
Meeting by presiding over it. I feel
certain that we are inevitably bound to
differ here and there, and I know how
painful it would be to you to find that
you had by implication given your

THE RAGE FOR PUNCTURE.
The Daily Graphic of November 30,
in an article on the prevalence of tattoo-
ing, states that one young lady came-
at different times with eleven different
men to a fashionable tattooer. At each
visit she signed her name, and the signa-
ture was tattooed on her companion's
arm. The lady is now married, but her
husband has not his wife's maiden name
on his arm, while of the eleven young
men whose arms were once so adorned
six have been back to have the name
obliterated. Clearly there is an opening
here for Professional Untattooists, who
might be attached to Courts where

Dr. YORK Davies' advice to those who
would keep warm in the cold weather is
to eat plenty of suet dumplings. The
burning of country mansions which has
been tried lately is undoubtedly crude
and unsatisfactory, and we fancy many
persons will give Dr. Davies' suggestion
a chance.
Grave disappointment has been caused
among the public by the fact that the
recommendations to barbers issued by
Dr. COLLINGRIDGE, with a view to safe-
guarding the public health, contain no
proposition that the barbers shall avoid
depressing their customers by pointing
out the state of the weather to them.
Glasgow Corporation is considering
a scheme under which all Glasgow's
inebriates are to be banished to the
island of Shuna. The chief objection
is on the ground of overcrowding. The
island is only 3 miles in length and
about 1! in breadth.
The Admiralty has denied the allega-
tion that H.M.S. Snapper ran down the
steamer Inverna, which is missing. As
a matter of fact, as the Admiralty points
out, at the time when the accident is
supposed to have happened, H.M.S.
Snapper was practising collisions at
Dundee, and successfully rammed the
dock there.

REFORM
TIME was when there were few more vile than I,
Few (though I speak) that deeper plunged in crime,
Few that have had so lamentably high
A time.
It were a fruitless labour to relate
The shocking details of my grim career,
My tastes were Awful, and my moral state, —
Oh dear!
To virtuous appeal my heart was shut;
Blithely I swaggered on the downward track;
I must have been the hardest sort of nut
To crack.
But now-oh Love, oh sovereign power of Love!--
DELIA has raised my thoughts to nobler aims;
I have reformed; I have a soul above
Those games.
I hardly ever stay out late at night;
Cards are a thing I very rarely touch ;
I seldom smoke-that is to say, not quite
So much.
My temper, though notoriously short,
Has lost its tendency to run amok;
I am as one with whom a child could sport

That never dreamed I had a turn that way;
Ah, 'tis a goodly change! Three moons agone,
Ere I had cravings for a higher bliss,
Who would have thought that I should carry on

And you, O DELIA, pearl of maidenhood,
For whom, through whom, th' Awakening began,
See my amendment! Am I not a good
Young man ?
It was for you, O DELIA, that I turned
This new leaf over; 'tis to you I bring
This offering; for you that I have learned
To sing.
I hope I have not spent my time in vain;
And when you see how greatly I've improved,
DELIA, I trust that you will not remain
Unmoved.
That, when in honeyed accents I confess
My seemly passion, you, with answering glow,
Will, for the sake of decency, say, Yes,
Not No! Dum-Dum.

SCORN not its title's unassuming length
That slips so easily from off the tongue;
Large virtues and a concentrated strength
On little pegs like this have often hung :
There is the Kirk called WEE,
There is the JAP, and Gog, and M.A.P.
Cow is a word identical in size,
And so is Pig; yet their united fat
(Or what appeared as such to native eyes)
Smeared on a rifle cartridge-simply that,
Just that and nothing more,
Started the Mutiny at Barrackpore !
So much for padding; now we reach the point,
Which is, that I would swear at any bar
That neither British beer nor beefy joint
Has made you, gentle reader, what you are,
Nor me the thing I am,
But our development is due to JAM.
Right antidote—with tea and buttered roll -
Against the poisonous itch for worldly pelſ,
It seems to permeate the very soul,
And I am only then my truest self
At moments when I gulp
Some preparation made from fruity pulp.
It is the labourer's joy: with this inside
Unto his sweetened task he sallies out,
Sustained by marmalade and manly pride;
Nor all the bitters (blent, or not, with stout)
Which are his daily drink
Can quite undo the work of good Sir Pink.
It is the loafer's solace; it allays
That tremulous feeling when a job of work
Forces itself on his revolting gaze
With an obtrusiveness too bold to burke;
His nerves no longer wince
If fortified by guava or by quince.
And who is he that lets the acid drop
Into the general public's jar of bliss ?
Who caused the shortage in the sugar crop?
Who is responsible, I ask, for this ?
How will he meet the clamours
Uplifted by our horrified Free-Jammers ?
What though he claims that it was he who slew
The dragon Bounty in a Free Trade fight,
And argues how his famous Brussels coup
Could scarce be bettered by a Cobdenite?
Judged by the price of Jam
His plea 's not worth a continental d-n.
For he has hurt his country's tenderest spot--
Her private stomach ; let but this expand,
And what is Empire by compare? or what
The links of Colony and Motherland ?
Let such ambitions sleep,
But leave us still our Jam, and fairly cheap.
In any case, we'll mock at JOSEPH's dream,
His visionary Preferential wraith,
Since past results belie his promised scheme
And man must live on works and not on faith;
Blossoms are lightly blown,
But by its fruits (preserved) a tree is known.

QUEEN SYLVIA.
CHAPTER IV.
The Queen's Father.
THERE are to be no mysteries in this story; and, indeed'
in this particular matter I am quite sure it is useless to
attempt to make any. Everybody who read the last chapter
must have guessed that the bearded, broad-shouldered man
who appeared in the crowd before the Palace and showed
such a surprising ignorance of all that had happened, was
Sylvia's father. If I led you to believe in the first chapter
that he had been drowned at sea it was only because at that
time I believed, in common with everybody else, that it was
so. Now that he has turned up, of course I know better,
and I shall not try to deceive you.
The fact is, then, that SYLVIA's father had not been
drowned at all. I am entitled to assume that he was rescued
or swam to land, and I am inclined to believe that he after-
wards spent some time on a comparatively desert island,
where he established himself as the undisputed monarch of a
population consisting chiefly of tortoises, which are not bad
to eat, and penguins, which are just tolerable if you know
how to cook them. He himself was always very reticent
about this part of his life, but it really doesn't matter in the
very least, for the important fact was that, though nobody
in Hinterland knew it, he was not only alive, but had arrived
in the capital at the very moment when he ought himself
to have been proclaimed Sovereign of the country instead of
his little daughter. Nay more, he had actually seen her
saluted as Queen by the people and, like a brave man, he
hadn't breathed to anyone a word of the secret which, I am
bound to add, no single soul would have believed at that
moment, even if he had sworn to it by everything that a
sailor or a King holds most sacred. When the crowd had
dispersed, he had dispersed with it, in order that he might
think out quietly for himself a situation which, the more he
thought of it, the more he found it to be both peculiar and
difficult.
In the first place he was undoubtedly King-King
HILDEBRAND THE THIRD—and he had every right to live in
several Palaces, to see his side-face pictured on all the coins
of the realm, and to revel in the enjoyment of untold wealth.
He was 'also, like all sailors of middle age, a very domestic
man. During his long absence on the desert island he had
never ceased to think of his wife and his little girl, and
many a time he had in imagination enjoyed his meeting with
them and his quiet but meritorious life in their society after
all the labours and anxieties and harassing solitudes of his
adventurous career should be over and done with. He was
fondly devoted to his little girl, though he hadn't seen her
for ten years, and he had dreamed away many hours, in the
society of the penguins and tortoises, in constructing a
brilliant future for her after he should have come back and
given himself up, as he intended, to her education and
advancement. Often he had said to himself, “Whatever she
wants she shall have: she shall never be disappointed-least
of all by her father”—and now suddenly he found himself in a
position of unnatural rivalry with her. If he declared himself
and eventually proved his title, as he knew he could, he would
drag her down from the position of Queen, and disappoint
not only her but all the people of Hinterland, who, as he
judged from the talk he had heard, were looking forward to
her reign with the liveliest satisfaction. On the other hand,
if he failed to claim his rights he was cut off for ever from
the society of his wife and daughter, and from all that
domesticity, the dream of which had supported him through
years of existence in a hut constructed by himself, without
even a parrot to cheer his somewhat protracted leisure. He

- CLOSED
MR. BALFOUR'S GARDEN.
(With acknowledgments to the
"Gardeners' Chronicle.”)
CONFECTIONERY FACTOR
It is not generally known that, not-
withstanding his strenuous life as a
statesman and philosopher, the Right
Hon. ARTHUR J. BALFOUR has devoted
much time and interest to the pursuit of
gardening at his beautiful country seat
of Whittingebame. Owing to the disas-
trous condition of the glass trade it is
true that the greenhouses have fallen
somewhat into disrepair, and the failure of
the beet-crop has shorn the kitchen garden
of one of its most picturesque features.
Still, with all reservations, the gardens
and pleasure-grounds of Whittingehame
compare favourably with those of most of
the stately homes of England, besides
possessing certain peculiar and attractive
characteristics reflecting the idiosyncra-
sies of their distinguished owner.
The undulating character of the
grounds, approaching at times to the
character of a switchback railway, is
exceedingly engaging, and has given
the landscape gardener free scope for
the employment of all manner of effective
devices. The additions that have re-
cently been made of Bamboos (Bamboozlia
subtilis) and other rare plants have lent
a peculiarly imposing character to the
formal garden, the chief feature in which
is an elaborately planned Maze, surpass-
ing the Cretan labyrinth in its mystifying
ramifications. Indeed it is said that the

THE CALL OF THE CONGO.
[Cheap tours on the Congo are being adver-

I go as a rule
At the coming of Yule,
To a place where the sunshine's obtru-

At Hydros I'm found,
Where dyspeptics abound,
And massage and physic's inclusive;
Or a shelter I grace
In some fashion-plate place
Where the giddy and frivolous throng
go,
But to Fashion adieu,
If the rumour is true
They're reducing the fares on the Congo.
Each English resort
Will lack my support,
Nor do Cannes or Mentone intrigue me,
I see the same faces
At watering-places,
And the places and faces fatigue me.
But I now can afford
To career like a lord
To the land of the palm and the mango;
To the Tropics I 'll ship
For a cheap little trip,
A week-end at warm Wango-wango.
Eluding the net
Of my usual set,
And the hump that it constantly gave me,
The lies and the smirks
Of refinement that irks-
In the Jellala Falls I will lave me.
In a place I will stay
That is called 0-go-way,
I will shake by the hand the Obongo,
And with vigour renewed
I shall come back imbued
With the charms that are cheap on the

comfort of the wage-earning community
are based may be said to reach Very
near perfection; and GLUBB's is that shop.
To know GLUBB's is to know rural
England.
But this exquisite symphony of odours,
this complex and irresistible appeal to
the olfactory organs, coupled with a
concentration of commodities impossible
of achievement in a metropolitan shop, do
not exhaust the advantages and attrac-
tions of GLUBB's Emporium. There
remains to be added the important con-
sideration that the limited space available
precludes the possibility of such scenes
as are too often witnessed in our monster
shops and stores. It is physically
impossible for more than a dozen persons
to enter GLUBB's at the same time. There
is, therefore, no danger of panic or of those
strange and turbulent manifestations
analysed by M. REYNALDO POUPARDIN in his
masterly treatise on La psychologie de la

tion may enrich the intellect, but solitude
is the true school for genius.” If GLUBB's

OUR War Office has at last decided to

said, are to be ready within two years,

Herr RENAULD, a Colonel in the Ger-

between European Powers would not
cost less than £6,000,000 daily, several

told, one from the gentleman who was
responsible for the successful War Spec-

to do the thing for considerably less.
Mr. John MORLEY, whom we had all
been accustomed to look upon as a

everyone to read BYRON, and poor Sir

Set off a robe of pale cerise ;
“The garb,” I mused, “denotes a clinging mood :
Propose to her, my boy, she's dying to be wooed!'
But when I gazed at her and sighed
She never looked the least put-out,
But anxiously observed that I'd .
“Been growing positively stout."
The accusation gave my hopes the lie;
Perhaps her costume erred, perhaps my prentice eye.
I met her in the ball-room's glare:
She wore an orange crêpe de chine,
With rose kroumeskis here and there,
And ruched with bows of apple-green.
The whole effect was just a trifle warm ;
“Now is your time," I said, "to take the girl by storm!”.
I sought a well-secluded seat,
And heard her whisper in my ear,
“I haven't had a thing to eat!
Take me to supper, there's a dear!”
I mentioned Love: she said (and ah! it hurt),
“Don't be a goose: I'm here to feed and not to flirt!"
I called (her sire was out of town)
And found her reading HENRY JAMES ;
She wore a crimson Empire gown,
Trimmed round the edge with whatshisnames.
An amorous languor that enhanced the whole
Revealed, I thought, the yearning passion of the soul.
But when I bent above her chair
She seemed to feel no answering thrill;
I heaved a groan of mute despair:
She laughed and asked if I was ill:
Her callous mood my inspiration damped,
I said “Good-bye" (like that) and hastily decamped.
And then one day I met her in
The railway train : we were alone;
She wore a coat of sable skin
Over a skirt of sombre tone.
I pined to speak the word, but her attire
Seemed to betray a mood ill-timed to my desire.
But when I urged some trivial jest
She smiled with such pathetic eyes
That something took me in the chest,
And, to my own intense surprise,
I seized her hand, and with a chaste caress
Cried, “Lovely one, le mine!"--and she said, "ALBERT !
Yes!”

LOVE'S LAST REQUEST.
PROUD maiden, I ask no returning
Of such little gifts as I sent;
The letters are fittest for burning,
Not meaning the thing that they
meant.
The gloves and the scent and the
brooches,
The sweetmeats, the small vinaigrette,
I leave with unuttered reproaches,
For you to recall or forget.
There's a pouch that you broidered and
brought me,
If you wish I'll return it to you ;
And a box of cigars that you bought me,
I only could tackle a few.
The weeds I will gladly surrender,
They 'll do for some other sad swain;
But the poems I sent you ---the tender
Sweet sonnets I want them again.
You remember the ode true and simple
Addressed to your firm little nose ?
And the sonnet induced by a dimple,
And the rondeau I sent with a rose ?
You remember the dainty effusion
That said I would die at your feet ?-
It may have been all a delusion,
But I think the expression was neat.
I haven't a copy, and therefore
I hope you will kindly restore
These things you no longer will care for ---
Because I may use them once more.
I soon may again be affected
To utter emotions in rhyme,
And really I can't be expected
To pen a new poem each time.

How I had doffed the cloke of evil-doing
For Virtue's thin yet plausible veneer,
To charın my DELIA when I went a-wooing, ---
Mark how the false gods till th' eleventh hour
Smiled, and then, sneering, cast me down to grapple
With wounds that mock the staying flagon's power,
And quite ignore the comfortable apple.
I had not told my love--oh, was it wrong?---
For, though I found her all my fancy painted,
I thought it better not to go too strong,
· As we had been but recently acquainted ;
Wiser it seemed to let the thought take root
In her young mind; to let the ice get broken ;
Essay my fortunes at the Christmas shoot,
And trust the gods to keep her unbespoken.
Full thrice the sequent moons had waxed and waned,
Yet there had come no noise of rival wooer;
And the wan star of Hope had risen, and gained
A crescent brightness as the days grew fewer;
Now had I seen the final day but one;
My qualms of jealousy had ceased to rack me;
When down my colours tumbled with a run
Just as my confidence had reached its acme.

O labour lost and tardily repented !
I do not cavil at the lady's taste;
It's painful, but it's not unprecedented ;
But to be fooled -- deluded from the start-
Basely deceived, and vilely brought to ruin !-
What of my struggles with the vocal art ?
What about all those clothes I bought to woo in ?
These are the thoughts that pale a person's cheeks.
But worse, oh worse beyond all computation,
I hold the memory of those tedious wecks
Squandered in moral rehabilitation!
Does it not thaw the heart, however hard ?
Does it not give the soul, however stocly, a
lang, to recall those bursts for ever barred?!
May you be sorry for it some day, Delia !
O reader, reader, what a dole is mine
After three dreary months of dreary labour
In walks which certainly are not my line,
Scorned by my friends, a nuisance to my neighbour,
Just when my fears of rivalry were dead,
Just as I thought that I was out of danger,

BERNARD PARTRIDGE
LTE sat with his hostess over their coffee, liqueurs and cigarettes in the smoking-room of the Ladies': Active Service
I Club--the only male among many types of woman-warrior, from Amazons of the Guards down to ordinary Imperial
Yeowomen. Statues of ATHENE (fully armed), BOADICEA, JOAN OF ARC, and Lady ROBERTS were disposed about the room ;
while under the cornice ran the names of other ladies distinguished for heroism-- such as ARTEMISIA (of Halicarnassus
and Salamis), HIPPOLYTE, JAEL, Mrs. CARRIE NATION and the Mother of the Gracchi.
“Have you many institutions like this?” asked MR. PUNCH (for it was he).
“I will mention a few of them," replied BRITANNIA (for it was she). “There is the Minerva Club for Literary
Women, the Hygiæum for Dress-improvers, the Josephine for Tariff-reformers, the Winston Pippin for Free-fcoders, the
Leandress for Oarswomen, Poodle's for Dog-fanciers, the Paris Mutuel for Feminine Supporters of the Entente, the
Tic-doloureux for Type-writers, the Siddons for Actresses, and the Sans Atout for the Unemployed of both sexes. You will
see we have gone far to solve that harrowing problem, What shall we do with our Mothers ?'
"Your sex has indeed' made vast strides,” said Mr. PUNCH.
“Yes,” she replied, "and this fact has greatly affected our size in boots. And I hear it is the same with gloves at
the Sans Atout, where the constant playing of Bridge enormously developes the hand. At the Hygiæum, again, they have
grown clean out of corsets!”
Delicately ignoring the last observation, Mr. Punci inquired if election to these Clubs was a matter of great
difficulty.
"Our tests," replied his hostess, "are of the most severe. Thus for entrance to political Clubs a candidate is
required to have established a strong influence among the babies of constituents: she must have kissed at least one
politician into Parliament. At the Minerva, Greek is compulsory.”
"Al! there," said Mr. Punch, “ you touch a question that has of late been moving the very marrow of our older
Universities. Myself, I am all for the retention of traditional colour. If our utilitarians want to become expert in the
making of steel rails, or scientific beer, or motor-buses, let them pursue their ideals at one of our provincial colleges.
But at Oxford and Cambridge there ought still to be room for Inefficiency. There at least let us preserve the love of
learning, pure and inutile.”
“Oxford,” said BRITANNIS," has set her fairer sister a noble example in this department."
"I make little distinction between them," replied her guest, "being myself alumnus ambarum; though, of the
two, the Cantabrigian element preponderates in my constitution. But Oxford had no choice in the matter; the advent of
so many Rhodes scholars compelled her to adopt a policy of protection. She could hardly allow the alien to pass through

her gates without some guarantee that he had not come merely to master our British methods of commerce, and eclipse us
on our own ground.”
“ The whole problem of the admission of immigrant aliens has greatly intrigued me," replied BRITANNIA. “Do you
happen to liave any views as to the right kind of test by which to differentiate between the worthy and the unworthy ?”
“The topic has for a long time engaged my attention,” replied the Sage, “and I have decided that Literary
Culture inust be the criterion. You may reinember the pretty story-revived in BROWNING's Balaustion--which relates
that; when the Athenian Nicias was defeated at Syracuse, his conquerors gave their freedom to all captives who could
recite from the plays of EURIPIDES ?”
BRITANNIA nodded vaguely..
“Well, far be it from me to underrate the merits of 'EURIPIDES the human. But I am convinced that we
have his latter-day equivalent in a certain fine literary series which I could name. Now there are often inadequate
facilities for studying the best English literature among, let us say, the Russian moujiks. So I would have this collection
placed in the steerage libraries of all emigrant ships that sail for our shores; and every alien who, on arrival, could recite at
sufficient length from any volume of this series should be welcome to our hospitality. Curiously enough, I came only
the other day upon a passage in this same series revealing the most remarkable foresight on that very point. It was
written under the heading 'Essence of Parliament,' on July 18, 1857, during the reign, you will note, of the Third
NAPOLEON, and ran as follows:--
“Lord PALMERSTON then smashed, as he conceived, the Isthmus of Suez Canal, declaring that the scheme was a
bubble, and also that, for political reasons, our Government would always oppose it. Some years hence, the chief
cabin passengers of the Bulbul, a steamer plying along the Suez Canal, will read this record in Mr. ---'s' (the
veteran pronounced the name inaudibly) ‘Thirty-third Volume (a complete set of his works being among the necessaries
of the voyage), and will smile indulgently, and remark how Egypt has improved since England accepted her as a
present from the SULTAN, with the consent of the Republic of France.' That prediction," continued Mr. Punch," was, as
I say, written in 1857, and has been fulfilled in almost every detail."
“And who, may I ask," said BRITANNIA eagerly, “was the author of this astonishingly accurate prophecy?”
A suffused blush, as of maiden modesty, incarnadined the veteran's cheek. “With your permission,” he said,
“I will retrieve from the cloak-room the latest, and, I trust, not the least, of that remarkable series. No, I beg you"
(for BRITANNIA's forefinger was upon the electric button); “dogs not being allowed on the Club premises, I may not
summon my trusty servant from his post of attendance on the doorstep; and to none of your foot women dare I commit
the carriage of so precious a document."
In a trice he had vanished and returned. Then, with a profound genuflexion, such as had never hitherto been
witnessed within the precincts of the Ladies' Active Service Club, he presented his hostess with a copy of his own
One Hundred and Twenty-Seventh Volume.

Mr. Punch's
Academy of All the Talents.
INTRODUCTION.

OTHING if not sympathetic and universal, Mr. Punch, when recently bidden by Royal
mandate to form an Academy of his own, decided with his customary sapience that if it
was to avoid the limitations of other institutions of the land it must embrace all the talents.
The highest catholicity should prompt him to extend a welcome of equal warmth to the
athlete and to the author, to the journalist and the statesman. Once this principle was
established, it did not take the shrewd eye of the Sage long to pick out his two score
Immortals. Nor was he long in selecting his President.
“What," he said to himself, “ do we want in a President ? We want address, eloquence,
presence, tact. We want a man who has time on his hands and no particular responsibilities. We want, in
short, Lord Rosebery.”
All then being in readiness, the first meeting of the Academy of All the Talents was called. The forty (Mr. P. F.
Warner excepted) came to a man, and amid a breathless silence Lord Rosebery delivered the following speech :--
Lord Rosebery on the Situation.
“ My LORDS AND Gentlemen, I need
hardly say that it affords me the liveliest satis-
faction to be present at this sublime ceremony,
the inaugural meeting of that long desiderated
institution, an Academy of All the Talents. I
admit that the process of selection finally adopted
was not that which originally commended itself
to my poor judgment. In my humble opinion,
perfect efficiency in all the members could
alone have been secured by entrusting the
choice to Lord Kitchener. That, alas ! was
impossible, the Hercules of the Himalayas being
already too fully occupied with the Augean
labours incidental to his Indian command to
undertake the task of nominating occupants for
the fauteuils of this august tabernacle. I confess,
however, that it was with something like a stupor
of relief that I heard that Mr. Punch, brushing
aside the Aimsy formulas which might have
deterred him, had nobly consented to cope single-
handed with this prodigious task. Of the
manner in which our venerable and heroic dicta-
tor has discharged his duty I need hardly speak.
We are one and all of us entirely satisfied with
his exquisite discernment. [Cheers from Sir
Thomas Lipton.] But, my Lords and Gentle-
men, it is not my intention to indulge in any
gratuitous eulogy of a personage who stands in
no need of any intellectual cosmetics. And yet
how can an Academy justify its existence without
The Chairman.

Punch's Almanack for 1904.
immediate and copious exercise in the art of panegyric? [Mr. T. P. O'Connor, Hear, hear!') I need
hardly recall to you the practice of the French Academy when each incoming Immortal pronounces an éloge
on his predecessor. We, however, have no predecessors. I have, therefore, in my capacity of President, decided
that the needs of the situation will best be met by a carnival of mutual admiration. The choice of subject
I propose to leave to the arbitrament of the hat-I may add, in parenthesis, that owing to my notorious predilection
for spade-work I have borrowed a shovel-hat from one of my fellow-members at the Athenæum Club—thus not
altogether excluding the possibility of that most interesting form of eulogy in which the laudator and the laudatus are
identical."
After suitable applause had greeted Lord Rosebery's urbane and primroseate periods, and his auditors had once
more relapsed into a state of silent expectancy, the President again rose and directed that the fatal hat, containing
the names of the Immortal Forty, should be placed before the Prime Minister. Mr. Balfour, with a graceful flourish,
plunged his hand into its depths and drew from it a slip of paper bearing the name, not of statesman or philosopher,
poet or golf player, but of Paul Cinquevalli. Nothing, however, comes amiss to our gifted Premier. Merely
glancing round, not, perhaps, without nervousness, to see whether Mr. Gibson Bowles, Lord Hugh Cecil, or
Mr. E. W. Beckett, had yet become Immortals, and finding that none of these was present, he drew himself nearer
his normal height by untwisting two knots in each leg, and thus began :-
AXE
Mr. Balfour on Mr. Paul Cinquevalli.
“It is a truism of biography that for the proper appraisement of the gifts of one's subject one must oneself possess
cognate talents. Versatile and manysided as our President is, I cannot imagine his rendering full justice to the
talents of Tom Morris or Mr. Robert Maxwell. Nor again, to take another concrete example, could the task of
eulogising Casanova or Benvenuto Cellini be assigned with any reasonable hope
of artistic success to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Clifford, or General
Booth. The balance of criminality in all these hypothetical cases would be
injuriously if not fatally impaired. Hence it is I feel that Chance, in directing
my poor right hand to the paper slip on which the golden name of Signor
Paul Cinquevalli is inscribed—that Chance, I say, in bringing my hand and
this mellifluous if unhappily alien name together, knew her business. Not
that I claim to be for a moment worthy of the high honour of celebrating
such genius as that which our Italian friend possesses, but that I am in a
small measure also in what some of my Radical friends might call, in their
picturesque commercial vernacular, the same line of business. It is one
of the privileges connected with association with my right honourable
friend the late Secretary for the Colonies that sooner or later one acquires
an aptitude in the art of simultaneously upholding propositions of a con-
flicting character. I was, I believe, always endowed with a certain skill in
the manipulation of words, but never, until the question of Tariff Reform
was sprung upon a heedless country by my right honourable friend, did I
seriously devote my energies to the mastery of this fascinating art. Most
of you have, I trust, at one time or another derived enjoyment from the
spectacle of Signor Cinquevalli when engaged in the congenial task of
juggling with three objects of such widely divergent size and specific
gravity as a champagne bottle, a cannon ball, and a piece of paper.
Without intermission, without a hitch, without a lapse, he keeps them all
going. They are always before you, they are never dropped, they are
constantly but never for long in hand. I too, as a humble imitator of this
great equilibrist, have essayed to translate these methods to the sphere of
high pclitics and to maintain simultaneously the divergent claims of
preferential tariffs, of food taxation and of retaliation. If for the moment
I have failed to achieve my aim, let not that be taken to indicate any
lack of appreciation for the splendid example furnished me by Signor Joseph
C:quevalli and Mr. Paul Chamberlain.”
Mr. Balfour identifies bimself with his theme.

Sir J. Crichton-Browne being the next member to receive the hat, it was removed to be carefully sterilised and
disinfected; the old lining of Harris Tweed was removed and a new one substituted more in accordance with the
genial knight's theories of sanitation. This process over, the Admirable Crichton, donning a pair of antiseptic gloves,

gingerly inserted his fingers and extracted the name of Wee MacGreegor. To another man the subject might have
presented difficulties, but the illustrious physician turned to his task with extraordinary gusto. He began without
a moment's delay :-
Sir J. Crichton-Browne on Wee MacGreegor.
“Pathologically as well as ethically no more congenial subject could have fallen to my lot than that assigned to me
by the fortune of the draw, which gives me an opportunity of clearing up the painful tragedy which envelopes
the career of my gifted but undersized compatriot, commonly identified by unthinking readers with all that makes for
mirth and ingenuous exuberance.
“MacGreegor's achievement is all the more astounding when his antecedents,
his inherited qualities and his environment are taken into account. As the result
of careful inquiries into his family history I have established beyond a doubt the
painful but engrossing fact that his great-great-grandfather was hung for sheep-
stealing, that his grandfather suffered from chronic neurasthenipposcelosclerosis,
that his mother was a dipsomaniac, and his father a victim to intermittent
elephantiasis. MacGreegor himself, incredible as it may appear, turned the scale
on the day of his birth at no less than fifteen pounds. Yet when he had reached
the age of eight, owing to persistent malnutrition—his diet consisted exclusively
of gin and taiblet,'—he was still under two stone. Offers were frequently
made to his parents by the proprietors of freak shows, but they decided that the
cultivation of his literary talents was likely to prove a more remunerative invest-
ment. The poor child was a victim to overpressure from his earliest infancy. He
was apprenticed in turn to J. M. Barrie, Ian Maclaren, Neil Munro, S. R. Crockett
and William Archer, and before reaching his ninth birthday was a past-master
of every variety of Caledonian jargon from the lingua franca of Lerwick to the
Romance patois of Galloway.
“He was inoculated in the method of Socratic interrogation by the late Emeritus
Professor Bain, and studied the shortest catechism under Dr. Robertson Nicoll.
Naturally enough these superhuman accomplishments were purchased by a terrible
expenditure of nervous energy. From his fifth year he suffered from peripheral
neuritis complicated with gangloid dislocation of the dorsal mandible. Aphasia,
metaphasia and fluorescent polyphasia were his daily lot. Added to the inherent
drawbacks of a mattoid constitution were the tortures to which he was perpetually
subjected by his parents, who insisted on clothing him in Harris Tweeds of the
most insanitary description, and forced him to learn by heart long extracts from
Froude's History, and recite the most stuntifying passages from Mr. Winston
The Admirable Crichton and his
Churchill's letters to the Times. The inevitable results of this protracted martyrdom
cannot be long delayed. MacGreegor, according to latest observations, is rapidly shrinking. While he is still
visible to the naked eye, professional etiquette and my natural delicacy combine to restrain me from giving full
details of his microscopic dimensions.
“But when his imminent dissolution takes place, I shall be under no obligation to maintain this galling reticence,
and can promise you, Lord Rosebery and gentlemen, that the Medical Journal will contain, in addition to a life-size
portrait of my beloved but wizened friend, full details of the post-mortem which it will be my pleasure and my
privilege to conduct.”

homunculus.
The next name to be called was that of our youngest star, Mr. G. K. Chesterton. Messrs. Hatchard, the
publishers of one of his works, had taken the precaution of distributing through the hall a number of copies of their
monthly prospectuses containing “ The Best Thing by G. K. Chesterton," and also “ The Best Thing in the Daily
News" (by the same author), and the perusal of these had predisposed the audience to anticipate a stream of
sparklets from this young master of paradox. They were clearly relieved to find that the virile mind was encased in
a body of even more overwhelming robustness. When it was seen that he had drawn the Member for Oldham, the
hope was audibly expressed that he would not fall too heavily on the other young genius. He spoke as follows :-
Mr. G. K. Chesterton on Mr. Winston Churchill.
" It is the way of the superficial critic to grasp at the substance and miss the shadow. In his attempt to appraise
character he overlooks the primal fact that the greatest natures affect notoriety for the express purpose of diverting

attention from themselves. Deliberately they will build up a bulky pile of reputation in the very eye of day, in order
that the shadow thrown from it by the crude light of public opinion may have the right width, the right length,
for the concealment of their private personality. The more crude, the more concentrated the light, the deeper will
be the shadow that this mass projects. Let a man be sufficiently known for some insistently obtrusive characteristic
and he may enjoy a perpetual incognito. Versatility is the negation of secretiveness. If a figure be played upon
by a circle of centripetal rays it ceases to throw any shade whatever. Thus, had the late Mr. Gladstone been
recognised merely and uniquely for a Radical Statesman, he might have practised unobserved that absorbing pursuit
of forestry which he counted even more sacred than the unity of the Empire. But the very catholicity of his talents
allowed him no hermitage for this avoca-
tion. His addiction to Homeric lore, his
inherent taste for Tory principles, his pre-
dilection for High Church ritual, his
passion for post-cards, his genius for the
culture of jam—all these tendencies drew
upon him so diffused an observation that
he could never lay axe to the most incon-
spicuous oak in the uplands of Hawarden
without being made the object of officious
remark.
“The theme of my present treatise fur-
nishes an illustration of the same impreg-
nable truth. If Mr. Winston Churchill,
late of the 4th Hussars, had been
content with an atavism, had been content
to reproduce his great ancestor, the founder
of Blenheim Palace, he might now be
reckoned among our only Generals; might
now, in the shadow thrown by the single
white light of military adulation, be de-
veloping his personality unobserved ; just
as Lord Kitchener, in the single white
light of military adulation, develops un-
observed his personality as a desolating
squire of dames. But the plurality not
only of Mr. Churchill's hereditary ten-
dencies but of his own underivative virtues
has made privacy impossible. From the
great Duke he inherited his claim to be
Mr. Winston Churchill in his Aviary.
a final authority on the conduct of wars.
From his father he inherited the capacity
for being a party in himself. From his father he inherited a political wisdom which even the infallibility of
youth cannot altogether obscure. Of himself he has learned the supreme tact den anded of a lecturer who
lectures on the subject of himself. From the same source he derives a talent for romance, ill-concealed
by the adoption of his own name as a nom de guerre. This plenitude of gifts, by which the attention
of the world is attracted as the lamp is attracted to the moth, would in any case have made the exposure of
his inmost heart a mere question of time. But chance, and the insuperable necessity of recording his own
exploits as a war-correspondent, accelerated the discovery of his ruling passion. It was in reading his appreciation
of the Aasvogel encountered by him in a wood during his withdrawal from Pretoria that the public received
its first hint of the mutual understanding, amounting almost to freemasonry, that exists between Mr. Churchill
and the fowls of the air. Yet it has been left for me to emphasize, here and now, the significance of the
implication thus wrung from him in the excitement of sustained autobiographical narrative; just as, not very
differently, I was the first critic to point out how much there was in common between the music of Robert Browning
and the notes of a canary."

Lord Lansdowne was the next to draw the lot. The noble Marquess, speaking in a voice broken with emotion
and French phrases, and with an accent which was not noticeably English, thus addressed himself to the task of
eulogising his immediate successor at the War Office :-

“MeSSIEURS ET Mesdames,—N'ayant point vécu comme Ulysse je préfère mourir comme Achille. Ces mots

into the vulgar tongue, he has spared no effort to make the armed forces of the British Crown as glorious
as his own character and as solidly compacted as the obstinacy with which he has set at naught the opinions of
Field-Marshals and other inferior military experts.
“Hélas ! ce fut presqu'en vain qu'il essaya d'apporter quelque remède aux maux
de son pays. Ayant inventé et mis en marche six corps d'armée plus ou moins que
formidables il se souvint aussitôt de la garniture de boutons qui leur manquait. To
these buttons he bent his great mind, and if to-day the British Army is a well-
buttoned force, capable of affronting the winter winds at a moment's notice and of
reflecting the summer sun from a thousand polished surfaces, it is to St. John
Brodrick, and to St. John Brodrick alone, que revient l'honneur de ces prodiges.
(Vifs applaudissements.] Ah, messieurs et mesdames, quel homme que ce Brodrick !
La froide fermeté qu'il opposa à la fureur de ses ennemis les jeta dans de violents
transports. J'admets que pour être ministre de la guerre il ne suffit pas d'être en-
têté, il ne suffit pas même de faire pousser deux volontaires là où il n'y avait que
trois. Mais réfléchissez donc. What I affirm is this: the seal was placed upon his
achievements as Secretary of State for War when he was removed from that post to
be transferred to the India Office, which, indeed, no one but a successful warrior
could direct. Vous vous souvenez sans doute de cette photographie du ministre
de la guerre en khaki. Ah, voilà le vrai corps d'armée, le corps d'armée aux
jambes crochues, aux bottes éperonnées et à la figure terrible. Regardez cette
photographie, mettez-la toutes les nuits sous vos oreillers et dormez en paix,
sachant que vous avez parmi vous un nommé Brodrick qui pourrait à lui seul.
mettre en déroute l'Europe entière." [' Très bien, très bien.']

Mr. T. P. O'Connor then advanced to the hat, and after remarking in a rich
brogue on its excellent N. A. P., he inserted his honest right hand and drew forth a
piece of paper. “Read it, read it,” cried many sage voices. “Taypaychez-vous !”
remarked Mons. Walkley, sotto voce. “Faith and I will,” the genial Hibernian replied.
“ The name on the paper is Sir Thomas Lipton, and it's an easy task that I have
before me."
Without a moment's hesitation Mr. O'Connor began, as if dictating to a typist, the following eloquent if some-
what severe and logical tribute :-
India's Idol.
T. P. on Lipton.
“Oh, those old days! I remember, when as a homeless youth, with nothing to feed and warm me but
insatiable ambition, I slept night after night in Trafalgar Square, I would wake early in the cold grey
of the pitiless London morning and think of the three ideals I had set before myself. Three only—not
enough to occupy the fingers of one hand, let alone the thumb—yet how overmastering, how sublime, I thought
them, ay, and think them still, although years are thick upon me and the cruel cynical world has given me
rude buffets.
“And these ideals, what were they? One was to take my seat in the great and august assembly which meets
night after night under that mighty clock which I could see from my al fresco couch, shining like a heavenly
luminary as it beckoned me to the people's forum. That was one ideal—to be returned to Parliament and lift
up my voice to redress the wrongs of my native country, then writhing under the galley chains of coercion
to be returned to Parliament and, note-book in hand, depict for the noble English press the emotions that fitted
across the faces of my fellow Members. My second ideal was to possess a paper that should be to Literature
what Madame Tussaud's is to the Louvre. And my third ideal was to be admitted to the intimate circle of
friends in the midst of which that great Irishman, Sir Thomas Lipton, moves and has his being.
“Gentlemen, every one of these ideals has been realised. But proud as I am of my seat in
Parliament, proud as I am of the paper to which I have given busy hours, buttery adjectives,

and my initials, it is of my friendship with Sir Thomas Lipton
that I am proudest. I remember Mr. Gladstone rising in that
historic building in Westminster to which I have the honour of
free entry, I remember Mr. Gladstone rising to outline his epoch-
making and soul-stirring Home Rule Bill ; I remember Daniel
O'Connell shaking his leonine mane until you could have picked
up a pin; I remember Canning's masterly speech on the Catholic
Emancipation Bill; I remember Sheridan's defence of Warren
Hastings, and Cromwell's words of thunder as he exclaimed

Walkley, who would understand what I was talking about, have hitherto deterred me from auto-exposure. It
is true that in one of the appendices to my recent drama, Brut and Extrabrut, I presented myself under the
transparent disguise of a Millennium-maker ; but even here I was hampered by the suspicion that my apotheosis
had already been anticipated by a public so indiscriminative in its hero-worship that it has actually classed
Sophocles, me and Shakspeare in a common order of constellation. As with the most detached philosophers,
from Boethius and Bunyan to Byron and Mr. Arthur Balfour, the passion for being misunderstood is apt to
develop into a source of satiety; eventually they achieve a kind of Pindaristic koros; so with myself. Disabused
of the charm of confounding my own identity, I descended to practical philanthropics, and for a few seasons I
permitted myself to give the advantage of my advice to the Tramways Committee of one of our Borough
Councils.

In courtship there is a phase that resembles the game of Bridge, where the

it differs in this, that the suitor makes his declaration on the strength of the

of what he knows to be in his own. The subsequent revelation of the facts often
entails disillusionment.
Marriage, unless supervised by the state, is, as often as not, a private

Mr. Henry James next came forward and explained at some length and with as much clearness as was
compatible with his reputation that he had to eulogise Mr. Seddon, the Prime Minister of New Zealand. In order,
however, not to disappoint expectation he would do this in the form of a passage from a novel which might or might
not be published at some future date not yet fixed by his possible publishers. He spoke as follows in a voice from
which every trace of American accent had been carefully removed :-
Mr. Henry James on Mr. Seddon.

“He laughed happily, still advancing, and found himself standing by a table laid for lunch in a garden finely
shaded by trees and redeemed from commonness by a fountain that plashed continually in a pleasant irrelevance.
Why had he come there ? On the impulse of the moment he was about to think of a reason, but, his caution
coming to his aid, he paused irresolutely :
"After all,' he said, with a quick glance into his sub-liminal self, “nothing really matters and nobody cares.
I don't care myself, now do I ?'
“ Thus reassured he continued standing by the table. Some-
body would join him soon-of that he felt certain—a brother
possibly, a long lost brother, or at least one who would pretend to
have been lost long ago and would thus convince him against his
better judgment. Had he any money? He looked in his purse.
“ A sovereign will do the trick,' he laughed; I can get rid
of him for a sovereign, whoever he is, and when he's gone I can
forget him.'
"Not for Joe.'
“It was a strange remark, made in a strange voice, and Henry
looked up.
“Oh,' he sighed with a poignant sense of incongruity,
'you're what's his name, aren't you? My something or other
from somewhere. A stout man'-he smiled again— yes, stout-
fat, shall we say ?—and bearded too. And you've travelled-oh,

"If I heard any one say that in New Zealand '
"Ah, New Zealand. A long way off, isn't it? And you 've
come from there? Or perhaps I'm there and you haven't come
from anywbere. You 've just stopped here, and I've—but it can't
be that. And your name 's Dick, Dick Seddon, and you start shops
and grow mutton—so much a pound, and the fat counts. Oh yes,
it does'; it counts a lot.'
“But even as he spoke there came a revulsion in his feelings,

and their hands met. Empire was clasping him—that much he
was sure of—and for the rest he hardly thought it concerned him.
This was the material point where all the rest was haze and printer's ink.
"It's Seddon,' he cried, rapturously, “Seddon from New Zealand. And he's fat. And we 're friends, friends,
friends.'"

UMUM
The next name fell to the dramatic critic of the Thunderer. Faultlessly attired in an evening redingote
and pantalons cut with perfect taste from the latest modes d'été, and wearing a boutonnière behind which the Grand
Cross of the Legion of Honour was understood to be lurking, the Mons. looked the picture of radiant well-being.
Laying aside his copy of the Poetics he extracted the fatal paper from the tendered chapeau. The name he
announced with a puzzled expression was P. F. Warner. For a moment the English Lemaître was in a quandary,
but after a brief colloquy with Mr. Andrew Lang, in which the word “ Plum” was distinctly overheard, he sprang
to his feet and in the most charming broken English delivered his discours as here set forth :-

“Non omnia possumus omnes. And how should I, giving laborious nights to the British drama and rich days
to the Stagirite, achieve the form of all the Graces? Yet I am aware that the game of cricket numbers good
intellects. The author of Waterloo, that ingenious lever de rideau, have I not seen his name among players for the
M.C.C. (is it ?), while the terminology of the field, a little abrupt and unlovely perhaps,
has its appeal to me by reason of a certain kinship to the terminology of the boards.
Thus, I understand that cricketers, no less than plays, desire to run; that short runs
are objectionable to both. Also that an innings, like a musical comedy, is all the
better for cuts. But I am no cricketer, nor can I now learn. O popoi !
“Yet we are in harmony, cricketers and I. And since Mr. Warner has not
extolled me, it is I that must extol him. Mahomet would not come to the mountain ;
the mountain, that is to say the Mons. (c'est moi !), must go to Mahomet. As I have
said, I do not play cricket, yet there is a peculiar fitness in the subject of my

the great post which Plum Warner has been called to fill is fraught with momentous
possibilities. He goes as an Ambassador from the mother to the most cricketal, I
mean critical, of her children. The mood of Australia is suffused with that spirit of

The hat was now offered to Mr. St. Loe Strachey, the Editor of
the Spectator, but not until he was assured that (1) it had paid no duty;
(2) it was made in Germany and had been “dumped ” here; and
(3) did not belong to a Protectionist, would he insert his hand.
Opening the paper Mr. Strachey read aloud the name of Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle, and plunged swiftly in medias res :-
The Editor of the “Spectator" on Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle.
“We are extremely glad of the opportunity afforded us by
the arbitrament of the hat of eulogising the great services rendered
to his country by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. As the creator and
exhumer of Sherlock Holmes he probably appeals to a clientèle
almost if not quite as numerous as that of the Spectator. But we
are not concerned with his achievements as a writer of robust
fiction in the present article-I mean to say, Lord Rosebery and

person singular, it is not Doyle the novelist that I wish to praise to-day, but, needless to say, Doyle the patron
of rifle clubs and the benefactor of the canine species.
“If we are to be secure against invasion, a peril now brought infinitely nearer by Mr. Chamberlain's disastrous
crusade, we must have a citizen army. We must, that is, have 500,000 men each provided with a slouch hat and a
Mauser pistol or a Morris tube, capable of hitting a haystack at, say, 200 yards. Unless and until we have such
a force we are living in a fool's paradise. If and when we get it, we shall be able to say securus judicat orbis. Now
it is in the encouragement of such a force, and especially in his insistence on the necessity of the slouch hat, that
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has, of course, rendered yeoman's service to the community.
“But this only exhausts, if it does exhaust, one side of his patriotic activities. If there is one thing in which
an Englishman takes an honest pride, it is his four-legged friend, i.e., his dog. Cromwell and Wesley, who
represented two widely divergent phases of the Puritan spirit in which the national fibre is most deeply rooted,
were united by their common affection for the dog. Unless and until an Englishman possesses a dog, or, failing
that, unless and until he has contributed a dog story to the columns of the Spectator, he cannot be admitted to
have reached the full stature of his manhood, i.e. to be worthy of enrolment in a rifle club. Now Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle has not only fulfilled this cardinal requisite of citizenship, but he has gone further. He has by his marvellous
invention of a phosphorescent dog not only established his claim to be ranked in the same category with Edison and
Röntgen, but he has immensely enhanced the strength, both offensive and defensive, of the British army. We,
that is, I, am credibly informed that a handful of men armed with slouch hats, Mauser pistols and one well-trained
phosphorescent dog, are capable of resisting a whole army corps.”
Mr. William Watson, who had been furtively consulting his own book of vers de société, entitled Assassins I Have
Damned, now stepped lightly forward in a pair of Pentelican sandals, and lifted the name of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain
from the revolving hat of the Parcæ. Lightly brushing aside the tears of the combined Muses, in a fine throaty
voice whose forensic timbre recalled the best traditions of the Payx, he threw off the following sonnet :-

Mr. Sidney Lee, who was deep in the pages of Miss Corelli's Sorrows of Bacon when the hat came to him, drew
the name of Mr. Montague Holbein. Somewhat discomfited, he did his best to induce Mr. Swinburne to speak in
his stead, but failing in the enterprise he took a header into his subject, and spoke thus:-

“ Most of us have in our tender years emulated those little wanton boys that swim on bladders, to employ a
quotation from the national poet. [The President here remarked that he must request Mr. Lee to avoid shop.'
• Hear, hear.'] But it has probably been given to few of the present company to achieve the degree of efficiency
which has been acquired by Mr. Holbein. Speaking for myself, I may say that when I made my recent visit
to America I had no hesitation in travelling thither by boat. Yet had I Mr. Holbein's capacity (due, I am informed
by my friend Sir James Crichton-Browne, to an abnormal proportion of red corpuscles in his blood), I should
doubtless have swum, a mode of progression peculiarly appropriate to one who, however humbly, endeavours to
justify his title of Writer to the Cygnet of Avon—even at the risk of being late for my first lecture. The subject
of my principal course, I may be permitted to mention, was Shak—['Order! Order '].

and say, why not fins ? For certainly this
gentleman has, when in the water, such a
command of all known modes of procedure
as to suggest the possession of these useful,
if not invariably ornamental, adjuncts. But,
as I have said, Mr. Holbein preferred, and
wisely preferred, in the matter of nomencla-
ture to strike out—as a good swimmer should

name of Montague he was guided by a sound
instinct which appeals with special force to
me in my character of a Stratford trustee.
[The President again appealed to Mr. Lee
to keep to the point.] Allow me to explain.
Montague was the name of the traditional
enemy of the Capulets in Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo was a Montague. Concerning

say so, unworthy of record in any self-respecting biographical dictionary, it is distinctly stated that he was
anointed with porpoise-oil. Now the porpoise is commonly known as the sea pig, an animal from which, five
fathoms deep,' mermaids cut their morning rashers—['Shame! shame !'] It would be otiose for me to pursue this
suggestive train of thought further. I can only say in conclusion that next to the pleasure that I experienced from
being presented with the freedom of St. Albans I must place that which I have derived from the privilege of being
allowed to pass a brief but heartfelt panegyric on my illustrious and buoyant contemporary.”

Mr. J. M. Barrie then advanced to the front of the dais. He had a child's rattle in one hand and in the
other a chain, at the further end of which panted a large St. Bernard dog. With some difficulty he blew a kiss
to the President, who said he hoped “ Barrie was doing to be a dood boy to-day.” Mr. Barrie then spoke :
Mr. J. M. Barrie on Mr. A. J. Balfour.
“ You are to understand that when I first saw him I was not so much struck by any greatness in him as by
his pretty ways and the adorable pucker that would come on his forehead if anyone should make a pretence, for
instance, of snatching a toy from his dimpled hand. Moreover he had a flush and a pout of his lips that no
retired Indian Colonel ever resisted, so attractive were they and so infantile,

This I tried on Arty and found him an audience
of unrivalled appreciation, never tiring of the
sport and urging me ever onward to fresh feats
with my fingers, so that after a quarter of an
hour of it I was compelled to desist, having, as
I was careful to explain to him, exhausted my

trundling it fiercely over the floor, an orchid in his buttonhole and a bitter flash of anger in his eye? In vain I
called upon Arty: he was gone in a moment, smiling, as I confess, with undeniable happiness and, in his
childish way, calling on the passers-by to witness how Arty was leading The Other Man (which was true merely
in the sense that, being pushed, he preceded him) and how his dear old Dooky-Dook (his former nurse) had gone
and left him. I was about to set off after them when Babsy-wabsy, which was Arty's adorable word for tum-
tums, warned me that the hour of luncheon was about to strike."
Mr. H. G. Wells, who was the next to be called on, wore his uniform as adjutant of the aëromobilist battalion of
the Sandgate Highlanders, and was observed to be munching a stick of Plasmon chocolate. Placing his disengaged
hand in the hat with his wonted decision, he drew out a slip on which appeared the name of the Duke of Devonshire,
Graceſully removing the chocolate from his mouth, and at the same moment stilling an involuntary yawn, Mr. Wells
Jaunched immediately into the following eloquent oration :-
Mr. H. G. Wells on the Duke of Devonshire.
"I am aware that there is a County of Devonshire—very inadequately mapped by the Ordnance Survey—but,
like Mr. Andrew Lang, I have never heard of its eponymous potentate, for whose existence, however, I am content
to take the Chairman's word. Upon Dukes as Dukes, however, I have theories, and if, as I imagine, I am called in
to assist in the education of the present Duke--what is it, Somersetshire ? Dorsetshire ? no, Devonshire-I shall be
very happy to lay the benefit of my ripe experience at his disposal.
“ As an advocate of the New Republicanism I have at times felt tempted to answer in the affirmative the
question, Should the aristocratic class be abolished ?' So far as I have been able to determine, there is no
peerage either amongst the Martians or the inhabitants of the Moon, while on this planet the hope of the race
is centred in the development of an efficient and instructed middle-class. The testimony of the best writers
of fiction is unanimous as to the detrimental character of Baronets. [Groans from Sir Thomas Lipton.] Earls
stand condemned by the revolting incongruity of a nomenclature which describes their consorts not as Earlesses
but Countesses. What are we to say, again, to a class which does not know whether to spell its title Marquis
or Marquess ? But the case of Dukes is peculiar. [. Hear, hear' from Mr. Balfour.] I may mention that I had a
cousin in The Sorcerer who was a collateral descendant of the Iron Duke: his name was John Wellington Wells.

Mankind in the Making, honours and titles are a necessary complement to the Republican idea, and if we are to
retain any of the existing appellations, there is none that has a stronger claim on our consideration than that
of · Duke. Endeared to the shoemaking and knife-polishing industries by the invention of a Wellington; to
tobacconists by the exploits of a Cavendish; to market gardeners by its strawberry-leaves, the ducal rank is one
which cannot be lightly relegated to the limbo of obsolete and
inefficient institutions.
“But, if we are to retain the order of Dukes, we must
use every effort to bring them into line with the require-
ments of modern science. My views on the education of
children are well known, and I would fain see them carried
out with exceptional rigour in the case of ducal infants.
First and foremost I lay stress on the acquirement of an
articulate and refined pronunciation. The clipping of the
final ·g,' calling window 'winder,' and other solecisms affected
by the hereditary aristocracy should be ruthlessly dis-
countenanced. Especial care, again, should be exercised
in the choice of nursery rhymes. •Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake,
baker's man,' as I have observed in the treatise already
referred to seems to be a thoroughly innocuous versicle,
and, if stress could be laid on the relative significance of
the big and little loaf, might prove peculiarly helpful in con-
solidating the principles of a free fooder. Again, a warning
against the deleterious Americanisation of our commercial
system might be conveyed by a judiciously revised version
of · Little Jack Horner sat in a Corner, Next in import-
ance to pronunciation and recitation in building up the mental
and moral equipment of our ideal Duke, I would place
the handling of toy soldiers, with this proviso, that every
army corps should be provided with a section of cyclist
volunteers. At the age of ten the Duke should himself be
instructed in the use of the bicycle (preferably a Bantam),
the Mauser pistol, and the Bartitsu method of self-defence,
a mode of fighting rendered indispensable by the Anglo-
Japanese alliance. His diet meanwhile should be most care-

fully attended to. He must never be allowed to drink at
meals, and should be strictly forbidden bull's-eyes, nougat, shrimps, truffles or pâté-de-foie-gras. Above all things he
should be kept from indulgence in narcotics.
“We come now to school. It is difficult to know what to say about school except that Harrow is bad, Eton
worse. Instruction by gramophone is perhaps best. For reading there is the Fortnightly Review and such a story
as my own Wonderful Visits of Elizabeth. Cricket is not to be encouraged-[cries of Shame' from Mr. Barrie]
but experiments in practical chemistry or ensilage are useful.
" I see no harm in the Grand Tour, provided that it is for the most part accomplished in a flying machine.
“ The time now approaches for the real business of life.
" What, then, does our Duke know? He knows how to drive an aëropile, and when danger is imminent, thanks
to me and my many works, how to become an invisible man. He understands the mechanism of the gramophone, the
pianola, and possibly the turbine. He can write shorthand at the rate of 150 words a minute, he can conduct
commercial correspondence in German, Spanish and Russian, and he is thoroughly au fait in all the processes.
which deal with the by-products of coal-tar. Thus equipped, it is time that he chose a profession; and for my part
I can think of none better fitted to his rank or his attainments than that of a scientific romance-writer.
"Ought he, then, to write under his own name or adopt a pseudonym ? I have no hesitation in recommending
the former alternative. For one thing, he will be the first Duke to embrace this calling, and his achievements will
have all the freshness that attaches to the spade-work of a pioneer. On the fortunate collocation of a title and an
author's name the success of a book has often ere now depended. This is a point on which I am able to speak with
a peculiarly intimate personal feeling, since I am all too well aware that the popularity of my romance, When the
Sleeper Wakes, would have been undoubtedly trebled had I been able to add, · By the Duke of Devonshire.'”

Mr. Hewlett advanced to the hat and drew the speaking name of Perks. A certain suspicion of collusion fell upon
him as he extracted half a quair of type-written foolscap from his surcoat-pocket, and delivered, from behind it,
the following flowers of English undefiled :--
Mr. Maurice Hewlett on Mr. Perks.
666 Pardie! but there has been mole work afoot,' cried Sir Perques, the same that was known as Robert
Hob-and-Nob, for that none could well say how else he came by his hail-fellowship with the Knighthood.
* And, so my boring methods serve, there shall be breaches agape
in the bastions of Heathenry ere the moon has done hollowing her
sickle!' And his eye shone shiftily in a face pale with the vigils of
Les Deux Mondes, this and the next. And under it a tabard stuck full
of phylacteries and splashed with the sign of Aquarius on a ground
of broadcloth; and thereto a running scroll—Deus et perquisita mea.
“But my lord of Durdans, that had Sir Perques for Squire unbidden,
lay a-bed. And over his pavilion blew a burgee that showed a hand-
plough upon a field of efficiency demi-wavy. And, save on fine afternoons,
when he had a fancy to caracole at large in the manner of the haute école,
rode he not forth. But at such times, he being within bolt-shot of the
walls, and the arbalists of the watch drawing upon him, he would up
with his hands and Odds Ladas! A truce, Messires,' he would cry;
would ye do damage to a chivaler and a sportsman that makes challenge
for mere joy?' and so shamed them by sheer weight of pleasantry.
“But Sir Perques, that was of a tough stock, and had no lore of
venery, brooked not these courtesies of the chase. And “Sire!' he
cried to deaf ears, our leaguer is wrought of laggard stuff, with none to
head the assault. By my halitube, but I will myself descend into the
heart of earth, and none shall say of me that I would not bore with what
strength I had. And let me but blow these blasted ramparts in air, and
- soothly there will be leaders enow to conduct a dead cert.' And so
disappeared into the underground and was no more heard of.
“But none the less my lord of Durdans continued to lie a-bed very
comfortably, or else ride forth, to the admiration of either camp, in a
privy capacity, just as it occurred to his dear heart."

Before the murmurs of applause which greeted the last effusion had
died away Lord Rosebery again rose, and, commanding silence by an
impressive gesture, thus addressed the company :-
"Gentlemen, or shall I not rather say Fellow Immortals! It is with
mingled feelings, in which pride is perhaps the predominant partner, that
Mr. Hewlett obliges with a mediæval turn.

supremely privileged to preside in the ornamental rather than onerous role of master of the ceremonies. My only
regret has been that selection was necessary, and that it has not been possible for every one of us to indulge in these
exhilarating exercises of eulogism. Yet enough has been done to vindicate triumphantly the prescience of the
august pontiff who has called this body into existence, and nobly filled a hiatus hitherto painfully conspicuous in
the Republic of Letters and of Learning. I have only one request to make of you—that you should join with
me in your most sonorous tones in acclaiming our founder and eponymous hero, Mr. Punch !”
A salvo of prolonged and poignant cheers was the immediate response to Lord Rosebery's eloquent appeal.
At last the Members of Mr. Punch's Academy, exhausted by transports of mutual admiration, retired gracefully
in order of merit from the apartment, and the inaugural ceremony was at an end.

RIP VAN WINKLE
AT WESTMINSTER
-
| Reading on, Jesse's head drooped on
his breast. The munching of the cow
by his side grew more dreamy. Pre-
sently he slept.
On waking in the morning Jesse felt
uncommonly hungry, but to his sur
prise was not at all cold. The weather
seemed to have altogether changed. It
was, in truth, or seemed to be, full
summer-time. The trees were in leaf,
the grass was lush. Grass reminded
him of the cow, and with that memory
came sweet thought of a brimming cur
of milk. Looking round he, with a
start, found the field, save for himself,
tenantless. Here were the three acres,
but where was the cow ? Close by him
he observed, half hidden in the tall
grass, a skeleton. That it had been a
horned animal was all that was certain
in its decay. There was also something
that might have been a tail. But it
had nothing of that kind, not a single
hair, to unfold.
“Strange,” said Jesse to himself,
“I never noticed that before. Must
