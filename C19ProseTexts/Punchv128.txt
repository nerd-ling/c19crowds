OF VIOLET, PLAYING.
DAINTY and light the touch of VIOLET
On the familiar keys,
The keys, responsive to her every
mood,
Elated, when she feels that life is
good,
And yet depressed-for notice, if you
please,
Until depressed, no music shall you get.
So light, so light the touch, her fingers
thrill
The deep, still pool of sound,
As 'twere the fleeting breath of
summer breeze;
Yet firm as some prehensile chim-
panzee's
Grasp of the branch on which his tail
is wound,
And pliant, too, like Mr. B-LF-R's will.
Often by crescendential chords she
climbs,
Or makes the spinet sing
Of bygone youth, dead hopes, and
last year's rose;
Tears dim the spectacles upon my
nose,
For, when she plays, "A Little Bit of
String"
Sounds sweetly solemn as cathedral
chimes.
Methinks, if he were sitting by my side
The elephant, who gave
These tusks that sing and laugh, or
moan and wail,
As she commands—that his expres-
sive tail
And vocal trunk would warrant him
her slave,
Thrice happy for her service to have died.

I take it his intention was to teach
The disadvantages of high position :
And that in fact we tend to overrate
The splendours of a Minister of State.
My own impression is, in Wolsey's day,
In spite of block and headsman and the rest of it,
Exalted personages had a way
Of somehow managing to get the best of it,
While the poor scribe who dealt with men of note
Had to be very careful what he wrote.
But now that pleasant state of things is changed,
The “insolence of office” veils its face,
And things are very differently arranged
For statesmen in the present year of grace
A thing which public men should not forget
When offered places in the Cabinet.
Soon as your risen star has left behind
The cold obscurity which masked' it lately,
Dick, Tom and HARRY promptly call to mind
That in your youth they knew you intimately.
Each chance acquaintance rises like a ghoul
Determined to exploit this kind of knowledge ;
The duffer whom you used to kick at school,
The bore you resolutely cut at college,
A hundred people whom you never knew
Proclaim that they have not forgotten you !
Such are the dire concomitants of Fame
At this depressing period of our history,

CHARIVARIA.
THE CZAR has issued a Decree insisting
on autocracy, and consenting to only a
few minor reforms. He is said to be
acting on the advice of his infant son.
The Russian Government is so often
accused of lacking a sense of justice,
that it is only fair to point out that, as
soon as proof of the escape of M. DE
PLEHVE's murderer was satisfactorily
established, the sentences on the two
men found guilty of the crime were
reduced to 14 and 10 years' imprison-
ment respectively.
For a wager of £2 a Lambeth labourer
ate twenty mince-pies in ten minutes in
a local public-house. This is likely to
lead to trouble, as it is quicker work
than the Trades Union regulations allow.
A gentleman has written to the Daily
Mail to complain that two letters which
he posted on the Saturday before Christ-
mas, and which “obviously contained
Christmas cards,” were not delivered at
Streatham till after the event. It is
rumoured that the Postmaster-General has
apologised, explaining that, owing to the
rush of work at that time, he mistook
the letters for business communications.
After appearing as Santa Claus to
2,000 children in Zion City, Dr. DOWIE
removed his disguise, and pointed out
that there was no such person as Santa
Claus. A more welcome announcement
would have been that there is no such
person as Dr. DowIE.

this play and that in a series of vast
parties.
Very well. You come to me, an old
hand, to know how to do it; and I will
tell you with as little digression as possi-
ble. In the first place it is necessary
to know the parents. No one, how-
ever thorough a child-lover, has the
entrée to a nursery without first having
secured the entrée to the drawing-room.
This must be remembered. Many ex-
perimentalists in this new game of
Toddle-worship, as it has been called,
have thought it sufficient to make ac-
quaintance with the nursemaid on the
Broadstairs promenade. But no: there
is a wide gulf, as the French say,
between the bord de la mer and the
salon. There is but one road to the
aristocratic nursery, and that is the
aristocratic drawing-room. Here I must
leave you to find your way for yourself.
Such secrets cannot be communicated.
Let us assume that your circle of blue-
blooded children (for none other are
interesting) is complete. The next
question is, What theatre shall be
patronised? This is a difficult nut to
crack; but let us omit the steps by
which the decision is arrived at, and
settle, for purposes of argument, upon
The Taming of the Shrew, since it is so
rich in the conditions for an excellent
youthful Christmas amusement. What,
for example, could be better for children
than to see Petruchio's behaviour to
Katharina? Here indeed is a ground-
ing in chivalry that should be of use to
every boy and girl. One sees the
children in the theatre literally shouting
with laughter, and it is unnecessary
in any theatre but Drury Lane to inquire
whether laughter is rightly based. At

the “Walrus and the Carpenter” are

pointlessness is trebly apparent, nine

sighs of boredom to ask what the deuce
it all means.
It is assumed, then, that we go to

best means is the electric coupé, which

thus convey a hundred children, which
is a fair number. The nurses can follow
in a dray.
At the theatre itself, once the children
are seated and have been made ac-
quainted with their host (although for
gaining an intimate acquaintance the tea
afterwards gives the better opportunity),
the duties of entertainer are taken out
of your hands by the spirited Mr. OSCAR

For the THOMAS, though recruited from the peasantry.
Was taught, before he donned the blue or red,
To consider even slang a vulgar pleasantry,
And swearing as excessively ill-bred ;
And the way in which you speak
Brings the crimson to his cheek,
And it elevates the helmet on his head.
In the future, if an N.C.O. deceives you,
If your men are being naughty in the ranks,
Make it clear to them how terribly it grieves you
To administer correction for their pranks ;
They must pay the price of Sin,
But you 're not to rub it in
With a volley of illuminative blanks.
ARMY REFORM.
The following advice has reference to an Order, which is understood
to have been recently promulgated by the Army Council, prohibiting
the use of improper language by subordinate officers.]
Let the ribald British Subaltern take warning,
Let the autocratic Captain have a care,
Let the Major with a headache in the morning
Give expression to his feelings if he dare !
O you wicked, hear the news !
You must mind your P's and Q's,
For the Army Council says you're not to swear.
If you 're anxious to remain in your profession
You must learn to keep your conversation free
From the charm of apostrophic indiscretion,
From the helpful and exhilarating D.
Be content with “Oh, my Aunt!”
(If you can) --and if you can't,
You can take it out in “Goodness Gracious Me!"
If you ’re gravelled for some flowers of invective
That are free from the reproach of being coarse,
“By my halidom!” is far from ineffective,
And “Beshrew me!” has a certain quiet force,
While the properties of “ Zooks!”
As a counterblast de luxe
Have a merit I can thoroughly endorse.
Then put off your evil courses with the old year,
And remember, oh, remember while you can,
That the treatment of the modern British soldier
Is conducted on the modern British plan
Of toujours la politesse --
And a lady-like address
Is the making of a military man. DUM-Dun.

DEAR SIR, -Sir CHARLES TRANSOM directs
me to present his compliments and to
express his regret that he must decline
to lend his support to the testimonial to

CHARLES dislikes to see this kind of pre-

NIGHT-FALL IN THE WOODS.
BY OUR FLEET STREET NATURALIST:
(Who rather fancies himself in the style of
the late RICHARD JEFFERIES.)
In this wooded country night appears
to fall slowly. Perhaps it is that in the
dead January weather the light in and
round the woods is never very clear,
and that, as night draws on, some light
is held and reflected in the golden sheen
of the fallen ash leaves, and so, as it
were, prolongs the dusk.
Here, on the north side of the great
wood, it is peculiarly still, and, as I
wait in an angle between a giant beech
and the crumbling wall of the old
Roman camp, objects across the fields
slowly lose their definition.
Early as it is, the note of the nightin-
gale floats from the coppice above, and
the regular swish of the scythe in the
meadow below can be distinctly heard.
Presently, from the corner of the
great wood, a hen pheasant hops out to
her evening meal, followed by her
devoted lord, and ere long the whole
covey rise and wing their way to their
resting-place in the wide stubbles
adjoining.
Still and dreary as woods seem in
winter, it is only so to those whose ears
are untuned to Nature. In the beech
above there is a faint rustle, and yonder
by the knot-hole appears the lithe red
body of a stoat, busy feeding her young
on the abundant beech-mast and acorns.
The rabbits seem everywhere; country
people still maintain that two or three
of these faithful little animals inhabit
one hole-locally called a “bury.”
From below comes the footfall of the
keeper-a strong and wholesome man,
surely, with his hounds clustering round
his feet. The sportsmen, bending under
their load of game, have crossed the
park to the great house. The sport is
over; the game has been counted amid
the lusty and well-earned plaudits of
the beaters—hare and grouse, partridge
and rabbit, and their blood stains the
greensward.

young Queen his heart gave a leap and he began to forget
his time-tables.
“By Zeus !” he said, "she is a delightful sight. I shall
enjoy this interview."
"Your Majesty,” said his Minister apprehensively, “will
be firm on the question of clocks."
“Trust me," laughed the King. “I will be a regular
devil for clocks," and, if a King may be supposed to wink,
this King did so to the scandal of the statesman his
companion.
The next moment the King and the Queen were presented
to one another and walked off together.
What passed at this interview I know, but I shall not say.
Many learned historians have spent much toil upon it, and to
these I refer the curious. Certainly it was a long interview,
and the two Foreign Ministers had exhausted all their
diplomatic small talk long before it came to an end.
At last the two Sovereigns reappeared, and it was noticed
that both were smiling, and that the King wore in the lapel
of his coat a white rose which had not formerly adorned it.
"It is the custom amongst Kings," said OTHO,“ to kiss
when they part, since Kings are brothers."
" It is an honourable custom," said Sylvia.
“And a Queen and a King," continued Otho, “are sister
and brother."
“Of course,” said Sylvia, “We must not neglect the rules.”
So they exchanged kisses in accordance with tradition.
“And, by the way,” said Sylvia in some dismay, “I have
quite forgotten to mention the question ----"
"Oh, the question of the time-tables and all that,” said
the King contemptuously. “As to that, I have decideil. I
withdraw my decrees. Everything shall be as before.”
“You are very good,” said SYLVIA.
“And you," said King Otho, “ are very beautiful.”
Thus was peace assured between Hinterland and Eisenblut.
SAD CONTRASTS.
The gentle savage on his lowly plane
Of bestial innocence and lack of culture,
Ignores, 'tis said, the modern social bane
Of boredom, blues, and mental overstrain,
That tears his betters like the mythic vulture.
Far from encouraging his private woes
He has a plan to dissipate them fully ;
When he is dull, he takes a club and goes
Off to the most convenient of his foes,
And beats him for refreshment where he's woolly.
Sartorial laws that guide his nobler kin,
Even from birth, which all experience teaches
To be a sweet and decent discipline,
The unembarrassed creature honours in
The breach, and quite neglects them in the breeches.
Holding th' immodest minimum enough
To give him due protection from the weather,
He flaunts, devoid of artificial slough,
His highly burnished suit of native buff,
With, now and then, a ceremonial feather.
When in his easy Prime's inglorious noon
Touched to the heart by Cupid's wanton arrow,
It does not make him sigh, or sulk, or swoon,
(As we do) or affront the solemn Moon
With serenades that chill the lady's marrow.
Our ordered ritual of prayers and vows
And soft persuasive arts does not impress him;
No. When he sees a likely-looking spouse,
He buys her at her market rate in cows,
And never thinks of her opinion, bless him!
Nay, more. While you and I must rest content
(Apparently) with one domestic chattel,
The uninstructed pluralist may vent
His natural polygamistic bent
As often and as long as he has cattle.
The labour of the fields -- to till the ground,
To reap the fruit, to guard the herds and flocks -- is
With us the sterner sex's daily round;
He, by a mastery too rarely found,
Commits the toil to his connubial proxies.
And thus he lives unchastened by the rods
That Fortune pickles for the back of Labour :
The worst (and happiest) of moral clods,
He never knew his duty to his gods,
And wasn't taught his duty to his neighbour.
0 Readers, we are very wise, no doubt :
We know a power of science, art, and letters;
But if you come to think the matter out,
The artless wildling knows his way about
As well as any of his cultured betters.
He never thinks of what he “can't afford ”;
His tailor's bill approaches the ideal ;
He does no work, and vet is never bored ;
And las, beyond all doubt or question, scored
In having solved the Problem Hymeneal.
And oft, when sorrow bids me realise
All that he has, and I have lost, for ever,
I feel that I am tired of being wise ;
And the vain, hungry, wish begins to rise
Tbat I were less laboriously clever.

ARMS AND TIJE DOG.-Drastic measures have been taken in
Hexhamshire for the destruction of the now notorious wolf,
if we are to believe the Newcastle Daily Journal. “The
hounds,” it says, “were in the shire on Monday, and about
a dozen of those on horseback and two on foot were armed
with guns." This is indeed to “Cry havoc! and let loose
the dogs of war.”
THE loose habit of speech by which we identify animate
objects with their surroundings—as in the phrases, “The
House rose to its feet,” or “The Gallery howled"--may easily
lead us into trouble. Thus, from the Exchange and Mart :--

THE NEW LAWS OF BRIDGE.
As some doubt prevails, except per-
haps in clubs, about the latest rules, we
have much pleasure in publishing them.
We think they will add to the amenities
of the game and greatly increase the
enjoyment of the players.
Dummy.—The dealer's partner, after
exposing his hand, bas no part in the
game, yet on no pretence whatever
(except as at the end of this law) is he
allowed to leave his seat, or to look over
his adversaries' hands. He is entitled
to say “Having none?” should the
dealer renounce, but with this exception
he must not speak, move, cough, sneeze,
wink, smile, laugh, or make any noise
or movement whatever. (If the players
are ladies the dealer's partner is allowed
to speak, but not more than ten words.)
Should he do any of these things the
adversaries are entitled to blindfold him
with his own handkerchief, to gag him
with his own pocket-pencil or penknife,
and to tie him to his chair with anti-
macassars or with strips of window-
curtains. If the players are ladies the
adversaries are entitled to call her “a
person.” He (or she) is, however,
allowed to cough or sneeze if he can
show a doctor's certificate to prove that
he is justified in doing so, and it is
usual for the adversaries to raise no
objection to his blinking his eyes, if it is
natural and simultaneous, and in no
way resembles a wink. Moreover, he
(or she) is allowed to leave his chair in
certain circumstances beyond his con-
trol, such as :-Apoplexy, Collapse of
the Floor, whether due to jerry building
or the weight of the players; Distraint
of his Chair for Education Rate,
whether he be a Passive Resister or not;
Earthquakes; Explosions; Fire, in the
same building; “Pins and Needles " in

consent of the adversaries; Revolver

AUTHORS AND ATHLETICS.
By LEVESON Tiles, B.A.
The recent and almost simultaneous
announcements that Mr. Hall Caine had
taken to tobogganing in the Engadine
and that GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO had been
struck in the eye by a snowball, have
naturally created a painful impression,
absorbing public attention to the eclipse
of all other topics, and revived the oft-
debated question whether men of letters
should or should not descend into the
arena of athletics.
Speaking ex cathedra as the apostle of
physical culture, I assert that there can
be only one answer to this question.
Logic, theosophy, and mental science
alike insist that the brain should not be
cultivated at the expense of the body.
Life is a rhythm, and though the pen is
mightier than the sword, a man whose
brain-measurement exceeds that of his
chest is seldom able to cope successfully
with all the emergencies of life's handicap.
Though strong men lived before AGA-
MEMNON, stronger pen have lived since.
But here, as in every other department
of human activity, there is need of
discretion and discrimination, and, at the
risk of being charged with inconsistency,
I lift my voice in poignant protest against
the incursion of our leading men of
letters into the domain of violent
athletics, perilous pastime and dangerous
sport. Our novelists, as the statistics of
our free libraries convincingly prove,
are one of our greatest national assets.
In sheer popularity they dispute the
palm of precedence with our leading

A month rolled by very pleasantly

Miss MIFFIN had written daily to ask
how the search was getting on. After
the fourth letter I replied stiffly that the
matter was now in the hands of the

from outsiders; that unless we gave
them a perfectly free hand we should
never recover the album. This stopped
her inquiries, and peace settled down

: WEDDING PRESENTS.
(By a Victim.)
- As soon as May had named the day
She issued invitations
To all the crew our mothers knew
(Including poor relations).
We were aware they all would swear
In language far from pleasant,
"Confound it! I shall have to buy
The blessed pair a present.”
Then boy and man in cart and van
And motor-car came driving,
With gifts galore, and more and more,
And still they kept arriving;
And housemaids flew, and postmen too,
Till all the terrace wondered,
· And night and day they rang away-
Lord ! how the knocker thundered !
We worked in shifts upon the gifts ;
>? And when we had unstrung them,
We'd twenty score of forks and more,
But not a knife among them;
And as we two had scarce a sou,
There seemed to be a caret
When silly mugs gave claret jugs,
I: But not a drop of claret.
We'd endless gongs, and sugar-tongs
Of every shape and fashion,
As if sweet tea was bound to be
Henceforth our ruling passion ;
We'd sachets, too, of pink and blue,
With sickly perfumes scented,
And oh! the show of art nouveau
With which we were presented !
- And, now we've got the little lot,
... We're under obligation
To every guest we most detest,
And every poor relation;
And by the time the church bells chime,
"A PORTRAIT-AFTER GAINSBOROUGH."

THE PATH TO PARNASSUS.
A l'ew WRINKLES FOR POETS COMMENCING.
* (With acknowledgments to “Smith's
Weekly.”)
THERE are few maxims more thoroughly
discredited than that which pronounces
poets to be born and not made. For,
while it may apply to bards who write
for posterity and ultimately secure the
STRICTLY
world's applause, many of our most
PROHIBITED
successful rhymesters have attained their
influential position simply by patience
and perseverance. The Poet Laureate
was originally called to the Bar, and did
not devote himself to literature until he
was twenty-six.
One great advantage of the poet's
calling is that it can be practised in
spare moments. Sir LEWIS Morris has
told us that a great deal of The Epic of
Hades was composed on the Underground
--or in bed, while the entire stock-in-
trade-pens, ink, paper and a second-
hand rhyming dictionary ---- can be
obtained for the outlay of a few shillings.
In short, the only serious difficulties
about writing poetry are the choice of a
theme and the mode of its treatment.
Many fine themes have unfortunately
been already appropriated, but there are
as good fish in the sea as ever came out
of it, and even an old theme, when
furbished up and treated in a bright,
crisp and thoroughly up-to-date style,
may prove extremely palatable. Fresh
ideas are not always easy to find.
Besides, though you may bring a poet
to the Pierian spring, if he has hydro-
phobia you cannot make him drink.
Hence the great thing for the poet com-
mencing is to acquire a good stock of
ideas, and to this end they should be
carefully recorded in a notebook kept
especially for the purpose.
Happily, ideas have not always to be
hunted for. They sometimes present
themselves in the most unexpected way.
Thus, the present writer once found a
saleable one in the pages of a money-
lender's circular thrust into his letter-

and CHARLOTTE SJUNDERS could, like Robson, make us weep in
domestic drama, and split our sides with laughter at the
irrepressible humour of their eccentricities in burlesque.
To-day real burlesque can no more be set on its dancing legs
than can be re-popularised BULWER-LYTfox's effective fustian.
It is but fair, however, to recall that within the last four
years there was one notable exception to this in the case of
the burlesque of Sherlock Holmes.
Mr. C. M. LowNE is very good as the beavy retired Colonel,
as is Mr. VANE TEMPEST in the objectionable part of the
imperunious, unscrupulous Irish peer, Lord O'Gorman. There
are no pleasant characters. The two principal men are more
or less unprincipled cads, and the third is a conceited little
snob, without the courage of a pretender.
Miss Nancy Price as Miss Chitty, the vulgar heiress of a
fortune made in gingerade, conscientiously represents, as
it may be supposed, the author's creation ; and as for the
acrid, uncongenial, semi-fashionable lady, Lady Anne Wilmot,
if Miss FORTESCUE, precisely representing the author's inten-
tion, as she must be credited with doing, contrives to render
this specimen of female snobbishness tolerable to a fairly
good-natured audience, it is a great tribute to her art.
Perlaps such an actress as the late Miss Rose LECLERCQ might
hare extracted some amusement for us out of Lady Anne,
but even then it could have been no easy task. Miss FORTESCUE
labours also under the disadvantage of having been called
in to undertake the part at the shortest possible notice.
Mr. McCleary's Venetian scenes are most effective, All
that could be done for it in the way of stage management
by Mr. Dion BOUCICAULT (who, as to the natural position of
furniture, still retains certain eccentric theories, on which, we
trust, his own domestics never act chez lui), has been effectively
done. But cheer up, Messieurs CHARLES and ARTHUR, like-
wise Cap'en ROBERT, there is another and a better piece where
this latest came from, a piece that will wipe The Lady of
Leeds out of the memory of man, a piece the éclat of which,
peradventure, nevertheless and all to the contrary notwith-
standing, will assist in replacing in a correct artistic position
upon our dramatic warrior's brow the well-earned, proudly
worn laurels that in this, his latest action, have become

drums! Marshal your forces, and pen in hand once more

From my high pedestal--that I must fall
To be a hired Buffoon - I really think
There would have been a brawl.
lor in those days I felt the sacred flame
Burn in my very cockles; then I dreamt
Only of loftiest theme and noblest aim,
And most superb attempt.
I would be sweet, yet lack no whit of strength;
I would conjoin high Milton's moral tone,
TENNyson's melody, and BROWNING's length,
With something all my own;
Till proud Opinion hailed me half divine,
And decked me (greatly beaming) with the bays,
And name and fame were synonyms in mine
Imperishable lays.
Friend, it has been to me a deep regret
That after great expense of time and skill
Candour compels the statement that the net
Results are simply nil.
I have not done the things I would have done ;
Fame in her temple keeps no honoured niche
For me; my plans were all upset by one
Insuperable hitch.
Oft in the mind some flower of epic art,
Or lustrous Ode, would gorgeously unroll
The perfect splendour of its every part
Into one perfect Whole.
In the mind's eye I saw each delicate grace ;
I knew each word, each impulse of the theme;
Only they always vanished into space
Before I got up steam.
LITERARY NOTES.
A WELL-KxOwy diner-out has, we learn, collected his remi-
niscences, and would be glad to hear from some obliging
gentleman or gentlemen who would “carnestly request'
him to publish them.
We should add that no names would be mentioned, the
preface merely opening as follows: -
“Although these stray gleanings of past years are of but ephemeral
value, and though they were collected with no thought of publication, the
writer at the carnest request of a friend" (or "many friends," if more
than one) “ has reluctantly consented to give his scattered reminiscences
to the world.”
'Tis sweet to give one's passion leave to flow,
Sweet in one's fond imaginings to soar,
But when you get no further, well, you know,
Friend, it becomes a bore.
And so it was with me. My noble pride
Was wounded, and my hopes were put to rout;
" What use," I said, “to have the flame inside,
When you can't get it out ?”.
And thus I fell, doomed by the iron law
Tbat hampers Genius with opposing wrongs,
To squeeze, “through scrannel pipes of wretched straw,"
My “lean and flashy songs.'
I am content to seek no lofty flight,
It is enough that I may play the Fool;
Others may scale Olympus' skyey Height,
Or quaff the sacred Pool.
I am not jealous; nay, I wish them well.
And, if they think it worth the wear and tear,
They can attempt the heavens, or go to Hel-
icon, for all I care.

THE TRUE FOOD OF THE GODS.
By F. Psalmanazar.
The letters which have appeared in
the Times on Japanese fare are doubtless
interesting and even instructive, but
nothing has yet been said of the infinitely
more seductive and scientific dietary
adopted by the natives of the Ruwenzori
plateau of Central Africa. I cannot say
that I am so venturesome as to try to
preach its substitution for the roast beef
of Old England or the nut cutlets of
latter-day vegetarians. Still, this article
may serve to lay before Mr. Punch's
readers what our diet really is.
The staple articles of food of the
Ruwenzoris (or the Rutituwenzoris, as !
BURCKHARDT calls them) are pulse, beans
and eels, with very small and occasional
additions of bonzoline forcemeat balls.
The following bill of fare, which
attempts to give the three daily meals
for a family of moderate circumstances
and healthy appetites, will show how
they live.
Breakfast (about 7 to 9:30 A.m.). ---
Halma soup (with vegetables, ponchos,
&c.), lava jelly, biled beans, pickled
cabbage, tea, Scotch ale, zoedone, am-
moniated quinine (sometimes raw eggs
with. Condy's fluid, or boiled sweet peas
or pangofflins, &c.).
Lunch (about 11 to 3:30 P.m.).-Eels
boiled in lava jelly, vegetables stewed
in lava jelly, pickled ponchos, biled
beans, tea (sometimes also a little raw
flamingo soaked in salt water, or par-
tially cooked pancakes, &c.).
A
Supper (5 to 10 P.m.).— Lava soup
(with vegetables, fishes, biled beans, &c.),
pickled bronchos, vaseline fritters, roast
pigmy, raw eels sliced and eaten with
halma sauce, broiled (or boiled) sweet
peas, early (or late) spring onions, tea

title of a paragraph on this moving theme in a Sunday paper.
It ran as follows: AVE ET ATQUE.
This is indeed to wave farewell with both ands. The
phrase “Ave et Aque" which occurred in the body of the
paragraph had no such double entente, but was clearly due
to a clerical error.
Reuter reports :—“A certain amount of insubordination
prevails among the crews of the Third Pacific Squadron.
Yesterday a sailor was shot for stabbing a Lieutenant.” But
surely this slight irregularity was only a case of high spirits.

HAMLET, PRINCE OF BRUISERS.
Mr. JAMES J. CORBETT has intimated his intention of appearing as
Hamlet on an early date. He defines his conception of the part with
the statement that he has always felt sure that Hamlet "was a man
who had a good, straight punch.”]
AUTHORITIES may still contest
The pros and cons of Hamlet's madnes3--
Whether grief occupied his breast,
And nothing more than chronic sadness
Produced those antics of the brain
(Discords in music else euphonious)
Which mystified the Chamberlain,
The sage, but flatulent Polonius.
But now there swims into the ken
Of critics, in their narrow orbit,
That king of talkee-fightee men
Known to the world as JAMES J. CORBETT,
Raising a more important point,
Than those of scholarship abstruser-
When times were badly out of joint
Was Hamlet an accomplished bruiser ?
JEM finds the Dane was not a prig,
Nor coward, who invites our stricture;
He made, when peeled to fighting rig,
A pretty pugilistic picture;
He had a most convincing punch;7
When trained, he was the best of stayers;
And showed as elegant a bunch |
Of fives, as SULLIVAN or SAYERS.
We know he saw-he tells us this
In language unadorned but fervent---
A Providence that never is
Of falling sparrers unobservant;
It went against the grain to stab
Laertes with a pointed whinger---
He would have much preferred to jab
Upon the “ mark” a well-timed stinger.
The end he looked for (see Act V.),
The climax that he longed for dearly,
Was to keep Claudius alive,
But maul his relative severely;
To pick him up, and knock him down,
Until he tendered resignation,
And eagerly exchanged his crown
For raw beef-steak and embrocation.
So all whom it revolts to see
So many players stark and bleeding,
When falls the curtain finally,
Will welcome this humaner reading;
When Mr. CORBETT takes the part,
Horrors that now from callous eyes wring
Moisture and melt the toughest heart
Will change to graces of the Prize Ring.

À HYGIENIC PARADISE.
THE HOTEL HERCULES, DOLCEMINORE.
In view of the increased attention
paid to health by all classes of the com-
munity, Mr. Punch is glad to be able to
recommend to his readers the super-
eminent attractions of the famous new
health resort of Dolceminore, where the
magnificent Hotel Hercules (Proprietor,
M. EUGÈNE HACKENSCHMIDT) has recently
been established under the most favour-
able auspices and in the most en-
chantingly beautiful environs.
Dolceminore, the newest and most
perfect cure resort, is a charming spot
situated in the centre of the Duchy of
Savoy, not many kilomètres from the
historic town of Salsiccia di Polonia.
To the south-east the hills rise up to the
twin peaks of the Monte Zingaro, which
gives an additional piquancy and verve
to the scenery.
The town, which is situated in an
open valley surrounded by foothills
covered with luxuriant boot-trees, holds
the record of salubrity in the annals of

FROM OUR ST. PETERSBURG
CORRESPONDENT.
Our special Parliamentary Corre-
spondent in St. Petersburg sends us a
detailed report of the opening sitting of
the first Zemskie Sobor.
The House was not at its full strength,
many members for outlying constitu-
encies being prevented from appearing
owing to the general cessation of traffic
on most of the State railways. A large
number of Opposition deputies were also
unavoidably detained in Siberia.
The Session was formally opened with
prayers and misgivings, after which
notice was given of the introduction of
various Bills. Among others :
Father GAPON.—Bill to provide additional
emergency exits from the Russian
Empire.
H.I.H. the Grand Duke VLADIMIR.--Bill
to provide for the acquisition of
additional shooting ranges on the
Nevski Prospect, Palace Square, &c.

reference to trawling.

Aurora.-Bill to discourage marks-
manship in the Russian Navy.
The Governor of Warsaw.–Bill for pro-
viding home employment for de-
serving Cossacks.
The most gracious speech from the
Throne touched briefly on the general
features of the situation. The deputies
were congratulated on the fact that the
Empire was at peace with most of the
great Powers, and it was satisfactory to
be able to relate that the Russian Govern-
ment was still hopeful of being able to
institute order and guarantee personal
safety among the inhabitants of the
Macedonian vilayets. Following on

WHY I AM BEAUTIFUL.
BY A Knight's TWELFTH Cousin.
(With acknowledgments to various lad'es'
papers.)
MY DEAR MAUDE, — Ever so many
thanks for your sweet little note. You
begin by saying bow you envy me my
beauty of face and my svelte figure, and
then beg me to give you some advice,
as you are on the eve of “coming-out,”
and feel that you are not half so pretty
as I. Candidly, dear, you are not. I
will be perfectly frank with you, dear
MAUDE. You are at present what we
call gauche, your hair is coarse and has
a "lumped ” look, the prevailing hue
of your face is a flushed purplish-red,
you are freckled, and lastly you trans-
gress the prevailing fashion in having
two chins. There! now we know exactly
how we stand! But do not despair,
dear MAUDE. I, too, was once as you
now are, but I transformed myself and
I can transform you.
Now, attend carefully.
Every morning I rise at 6:30. By
this means I am always able to be down
in time for luncheon at 2:0. I at once
remove my face-mask, sleeping-gloves,
chin-strap, &c., &c., and then begin my
simple little round of pleasant exercises.
First of all my chin must be prevented
from having a partner! Standing on
my toes and balancing myself by holding
on to the chest of drawers I force my
chin as far upwards and outwards as it
will go, and in this position twist my
head round and round with slow, stately
movements for one hour by the clock.
In order to lend a little extra interest to
this exercise, I playfully pretend each
time my head comes to the front that I
am greeting one of my friends. Thus:
“Good - morning, Duchess,” I exclaim,
gracefully inclining my neck, and “Good-
evening, Lord DUMARESQUE,” with a some-
what distant smile, and so on. It is
with a pleasant feeling of swan-like
fatigue (if I may so term it) that I next

thoughtfully at a pocket - barometer.
After that he produced paper and
pencil, and was immersed apparently in
difficult sums. Finally, he summoned
one of his caddies, who carried a metal
cylinder. A golf-ball was connected to
this by a piece of india-rubber tubing,
and a slight hissing noise was heard.

alternative proposals were discussed,
protested he did not care which way the
decision went, but insisted that, if the
matter were dealt with in both Houses of
Parliament, an identical story should
be told ?

he presented the appearance of a deaf
mute.

momentous new departure. He called

days old, refused to recognise his oldest
friends, stood on his head and attempted
to walk up walls.

down a cup of coffee and splashed my

swallowed what I was about to say.
She was opposite.
It is useless to describe her, for I
could not do justice to her sweet face,
her graceful figure, her wistful smile.
She was dressed, I noticed, in black;
poorly yet neatly. From her pocket she
took the Evening News-ah! that bond
of sympathy between us!
My brain whirled. It was her dear
coffee that lay on my scone. With
difficulty I resumed my meal.
The waitress stopped again at our
table, wrote out our bills and hurried
on. Involuntarily I glanced at hers.
It was fivepence; mine was sixpence. I

“ PEAGAM,” answered that gentleman.
“Ah," said the man, “that settles it.
I thought as much from your appearance,
but the name decides me. Generally
spoken of as 'Mister' PEAGAM, aren't
you? I know. Little sketches of middle-
class humour; very amusin' but getting
a bit over-done."
“But,” cried Mr. PEAGAM, his mind
vainly striving to grapple with such a
discovery, “do you mean to say that all
those horrors in the popular Magazines
might happen to me? I might be killed
at any moment!'
"Not you,” said the man contemptu-
ously. “With that name you 're safe
enough. You 're one of the comic sort;
lose your return ticket, or sit on your
hat-nothing dangerous. And here we
have another popular type.”
He indicated a third-class compart-
ment in which Mr. PEAGAM perceived
several working-men poking fun at an
anæmic-looking curate who seemed
strangely apprehensive of the dangers of
travelling.
“Foolish of them,” said his com-
panion. “They should know by now
that such behaviour always results in
an accident, in which the curate saves
their lives and is cheered by the pas-
sengers. It might come at any moment.
Let us move further off.”
But it was too late. Even as he spoke
there was a cry of terror from the by-
standers. Mr. Peagam had just time to
realise that a collision was imminent
and to catch that inevitable gleam of
resolution on the pale face of the curate,
when with a sickening jar-he awoke.
“And Heaven be thanked,” said Mr.
PEAGAM to himself, as he stooped to pick
up his Magazine which had fallen to the
floor, “that they don't happen, after all!”
The other passengers, perhaps for this
very reason, continued to read placidly.

the Home District. These centres of
attrac ion are largely used by burglars,
and they would be even more popular if
the profession could feel themselves
secure from police persecution while
working them. If five hundred London
burglars were to subscribe three guineas
apiece, after paying the rent of a small
London office and a clerical secretary's
salary, about £650 would remain for
actual work on each of these two classes
of dwelling-place. Each class would be
divided up into convenient sections of
about ten to fifteen miles, each section
would be entrusted to some receiver of
stolen goods (or other agent) living on
that section, and in return for a payment
of, approximately, £l to £1 10s. a week
he would be expected to keep a sharp
eye on the section allotted to him. If
necessary, he would have to employ a
boy, whose sole work would be to cycle
up and down that particular neighbour-
hood and watch it carefully. All agents
of the society would be connected by
telephone with headquarters, and with
each other. A burqlar going into Surrey
would stop at, say, Kingston, and would
receive from the society's agent there a
list of the traps brought up to date, and
in the event of any fresh traps being set
in any particular section during the day,
the agents would hang out an unmis-
takable danger signal. Such a scheme
may sound illegal, and almost immoral,
to those who do not burgle, but the cost
of police traps to the burgling community
is so large, that, in self-defence, burglars
would do well to adopt some such
method of protection. Real co-operation
is required this season from my readers.
Early information of police traps is
wanted for publication. I therefore offer
a reward of 10s. 6d. for detailed par-
ticulars of any fresh police traps. I
stipulate only that: (1) the trap shall be
in England; (2) that it has not been
published before; (3) that I pay only
once for each trap--that is, to the person

Special Interviews.
WILL THE CORNSTALKS GET BACK THE
ASHES ?
With a view to obtaining some inform-
ation on the burning question of the
hour Mr. Punch proceeded to Lord's
with his notebook. He was lucky
enough to find Mr. P. F. WARNER at the
nets, and after his practice that gentle-
man courteously spared him a few
minutes.
“Now what do you think of the
Australian team?" asked Mr. Punch.
“It has been greatly underrated,” said
the genial “ Plum.” “You know that it
is practically the same side that we
defeated in Australia; and that,” he
added modestly, “was the best eleven
that ever played for them. VICTOR
TRUMPER is undoubtedly the best bat
in the world at present, while Duff is
at least his equal. Then Hill, in the
opinion of many, is the superior of both.
Throw in NOBLE and you have a quar-
tette.”
“But there is a tail, is there not ?"
Mr. WARNER laughed. “Three of the
best bats in Australia at the present
moment,” he said, "are ARMSTRONG,
Hopkins and GEHRS. They are enor-

on any wicket. Add to them DARLING

COTTER is one of the most promising of
the younger batsmen, and you will see

"But at least the bowling is weak,”
urged Mr. Punch.
“That is where the critics make their
mistake. I consider the bowling
superior to the batting. With HOWELL,

THE SECRET OF A GREAT PICTURE.
Famous Artist IntervieWED.
The Hon. HENRY Pitman's thrilling
picture “Not Out” is the staple of
conversation in all cricket pavilions
during the luncheon and tea intervals.
The canvas, as visitors to Burlington
House are well aware, depicts a scene
at Lord's. The batsman has just cut a
ball into the hands of Point. The
fieldsman has evidently brought off a
smart catch, and from the jubilant
expression on the countenance of the
bowler--ALBERT TROTT--it is clear that
he has made a confident appeal to the
umpire. How then can one reconcile
the title with the picture?
The opinion of the experts being
unanimously in favour of the view that
the title is a misnomer, Mr. Punch's
representative determined to go to head-
quarters for a clue to the mystery.
"To me,” remarked Mr. PITMAN, “it is
self-evident, though I am quite prepared

EDITORS AND TRADE,
[". The tailor's shop is mine,' replied the
editor. He was running the two businesses
together. The combination of incongruous
businesses is much more common in London
than one might think.”- British Weekly.]
ARMED with the suggestion thus
thrown out by our serious contemporary,
a representative of this paper set forth
yesterday morning in one of the new
four-wheeled hansoms bent upon dis-
covering some of the secrets adumbrated
by the British Weekly's contributor.
After a series of masterly manæuvres
in the neighbourhood of Printing House
Square, for, as one may suppose, there
is much secrecy to penetrate in these
matters, our sleuth-hound ascertained
that Mr. BUCKLE, the Editor of the
Times, is by no means an idle man
when off thundering duty. The great
universal providing establishment in
Leather Lane, which is famous all over
the world as Strap's Emporium, is in
reality Mr. BUCKLE's. Mr. BUCKLE's is
the brain that directs all STRAP's opera-
tions. But we cannot go so far as to
state that colitributions to the Times are
paid by vouchers for STRAP's goods.
Mr. BUCKLE is by no means alone.
The Editor of the Morning Post, Mr.
FABIAN WARE, has a large factory in the
Potteries, and a retail house in town for
the supply of crockery for Socialists.
Mr. BERNARD SHAW buys all his plates
and dishes of Mr. FABIAN WARE.
Pursuing his investigations in Welling-
ton Street, our representative made the
startling discovery that Mr. Sr. LOE
STRACHEY, the Editor of the Spectator,
keeps a cat and canary shop in Seven
Dials as well as a gunsmith's establish-
ment on Shooter's Hill for the manu-
facture of Lewis Morris Tubes and other
lethal weapons employed by rifle clubs.
After a brief rest, rendered necessary
by this momentous discovery, our special
plenipotentiary made his way to the
palatial offices of T.P.'s Weekly, and
waited until the Editor emerged from
the stately portals. Following the great
publicist at a discreet distance for the
space of several parasangs, he eventually
tracked him down to a sumptuous
creamery in Soho, where, under the
genial pseudonym of Pat D'Orly, the
famous panegyrist drives a roaring trade
in the richest and most nutritious butter.

There was once a wooden-legged man
who was lost in the snow. He fought
his way to a hut where a woodman had
lived; but the woodman was dead and the
hut was deserted. He had some matches
and he found some twigs on the hearth,
but no other firing. He lit the twigs
and broke up a chair and burned it, and
so got warmth into him. Then he broke
up the only other chair. Then he
burned the table. Still no one came.
He ate nothing for hours and hours,
hoping for relief. Then he ate his boot.
At last all the furniture was burnt,
but if he let the fire out he would die.
So he took off his leg and burned that,
and went on eating his boot. Just as
he was swallowing the last piece of the

Hail, Heavenly Spring,
To whom the poets sing,
Chanting thy praises each returning year!

That have more cause than they to hold thee deur,
Am moved to raise
My voice in praise
Now that I see thee here.
It is not merely that thy skies are blue,
Thy fields aglow
With cowslips and the flaming marigold,
Though that is so.
But other joys are thine
(And mine)
Still more deserving to be told.
For oh, Sweet Spring, thou meanest unto me
Far more.
Than poets (a lean tribe at best)
Have ever properly expressed
Before.
Thou bring'st to us
The succulent asparagus,
The new potato and the early pea.
Thy gooseberry,
Lurking, divinely green, within a tart,
Makes glad the heart,
The swelling heart of me.
Thy lark that soaring high
Her liquid strain
Again and yet again
Pours forth in ecstasy
Maketh an even more ecstatic pie.
Thy little lambs
That frisk and bleat
Beside their dams
Are excellent to eat.
While in thy limpid streamlets lurks the trout
(I like him even better out!)
Therefore, Sweet Spring, thy name
Ever will I acclaim,
And while thy food
Remaineth good
I will exalt the same.

thing is that according to this ancient
man's testimony the horses at the Derby
were ridden by little boys in bright
colours who were tied to their necks.
Old prints and photographs show the
horse as a beast not only of draught but
of burden. Both men and women in
the barbarous times clung to its mane on
occasion, but the usual thing was to sit
in a cart or carriage and be pulled.
There is, however, a record of some of
the more hardy of both sexes riding, as
it was called, for pleasure; but it is not
easy for us, who are accustomed to the
comfortable padded seats of the motor-
car, to see where the pleasure was to be
found. When used for draught purposes
the horse was guided by leathern straps,
which the driver, or chauffeur as we
should say, held in his hands and pulled
to the right or left as the case miglit be.
For heavy loads as many as four horses
might be driven at once.
As one may suppose, very little safety
was insured with such a rudimentary
mode of locomotion, and the records of
acidents are numerous. In those days,
à certain remnant of the old retro-
gressive courtesy still existing, it was
customary for a driver who had knocked
down a foot - passenger to stop and
render assistance. With the advent of
the mɔtor-car and the reorganisation of
the rights of pedestrians came the
saving of all time that hitherto had been
spent in such idle forms of politeness,
and little accidents to walkers soon
settled down as a recognised part of the
day's routine, of no more account than

SOLISTRY, or character-reading by the
lines of the foot, is quite the vogue in
America, and bids fair to outrival the
attractions of Palmistry in this country.
Not only by the lines on the sole but by the
size and shape of the foot can the most
unexpected propensities be discovered.
Thus, according to expert solists, the
short, plump, rosy-toed specimen is
indicative of an uncontrollable gaiety
of disposition alternating with rapid
gusts of temper, and is generally found
among ladies of the lower-upper and
upper-middle classes, though also evident
in steam laundry circles.
The nervous, sensitive and highly-
strung foot indicates indifference for the
feelings of others, absence of mental
calibre, and an insatiable appetite for
unmerited admiration. This type is

THE TRIUMPH OF YOUTH.
Why should music enjoy the monopoly
of precocious talent? This is a question
which until recently occupied a good
deal of attention in scientific circles, but
it is satisfactory to learn that a series of
experiments are now in progress which
will, it is believed, conclusively vindicate
the claims of youth in a variety of other
callings.
Amongst the names of those recently
appointed to be King's Counsel will be
noticed that of Mr. Opo Chick. Mr. CHICK,
who is not yet twelve, has not been called
to the Bar, and his promotion has caused
a certain amount of surprise and even
resentment amongst sticklers for the
rigid observance of legal etiquette.
Happily the LORD CHANCELLOR is not one
of those who takes a pedantic view of
his obligations. The experience of recent
years, moreover, is entirely in favour of
the innovation ; for, if it is legitimate to
elevate to the Bench a barrister who has
no practice worth speaking of, only a
very modest extension of the principle is
required to justify the appointment of a
King's Counsel who has not yet been
called to the Bar.
Although there is no foundation for
the report that Mr. ALFRED Austin has
resigned the office of Laureateship, we
have every reason to believe that the
choice of his successor has already been
decided by a plébiscite held by the

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM THE Diary of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, May 29.
When, early last Session, PRINCE ARTHUR'S
illness necessitated the naming of AKERS-
Douglas as his deputy in Leadership
of House, difficulties of position were
enhanced by recent reconstruction of
Ministry. Veterans like DEVONSHIRE,
GEORGE HAMILTON, RITCHIE, BALFOUR OF
BURLEIGH, ARTHUR ELLIOT, had withdrawn.
In their place came ALFRED LYTTELTON,
AilwYN FELLOWES, BALCARRES, VICTOR
CAVENDISH, EARL PERCY, BROMLEY-DAVEN-
PORT. Inevitably this state of things
was recognised as a Ministry composed
of “Young Men and Old Akers.”
To-day House returns to old condition
of affairs. PRINCE ARTHUR celebrates the
hottest day of the year, the temperature
81° in the shade of London parks, by
developing a chill. This especially
awkward in view of the arrangements
for to-morrow night, when Opposition
Vote of Censure was to come on. The
fight indefinitely postponed; all other
business arrangements upset.
ACLAND-HOOD made the medium of
communication of this turn of events.
What did that mean? Was he, in addi-
tion to labour in the Whips' Room, so
strenuous as occasionally to flush his
pallid cheek with sunset glow, going to
tack on the duties of Leader? The
orderly mind of Swift MacNeill per-
ceived the inconvenience of dubiety on
this score.
“Who," he asked, “will lead the

LITERATURE AS A FINE ART.
THE AGENCY.
The Shelley Literary Agency bas for
its object the assistance of young, in-
experienced, or (more rarely) bashful
aspirants towards the pursuit of letters.
The advantages of such an institution
require, and indeed admit of, little com-
ment. For the comparatively nominal
sum of Five Shillings, either in postal
orders or unused penny or halfpenny
stamps, the manuscripts of our clients
are submitted, with the Society's recom-
mendation, to at least five-and-twenty
different editors, thus ensuring careful
consideration, while at the same time
avoiding the inconvenience, and in some
cases actual risk, that might attend a
personal visit on the part of the writers.
Moreover it will be obvious that the
mere choice of an objective is frequently
a matter calling for the exercise of
considerable technical skill. Thus, for
example, a manuscript unsaleable to the
Athenæum might conceivably find a
ready market in Snappy-Snips ; and
vice versâ. The experts employed by
us are in almost every case enabled to
judge immediately of the most promising
destination for any variety of article,
and to act accordingly. Our terms for
revising (a frequent and most useful
branch of the Society's enterprise) depend
on the merit of the work submitted, and
vary from 2s. 6d. upwards. Our criticism
is always strictly candid, a candid critic
being (as has been justly observed) a
true friend. In proof of this we have
only to point to our testimonials, a small
selection from which is appended. Any

DIARY OF THE LATE RUSSIAN NAVY.
DEAR MR. Punch, --Now that Russia has, for the last time
(if we except certain subsequent occurrences), ceased to exist
as a naval Power, it is an opportune moment to consider the
extraordinary career of its Navy during the last sixteen months.
I cannot claim to be an expert in technical matters, but I have
followed the course of the war very carefully in the pages of
my Daily Mail and Times, and have kept a diary of the ups
and downs (if I may say so without being thouglit to jest) of
the Russian Fleet. I append this for the benefit of your
readers.
February 8, 1904.--War breaks out. Czarevitch and Ret-
risan torpedoed, and placed out of action for the rest of the
war. Sevastopol rendered useless.
February 9. -Poltava and four cruisers placed out of action
for the rest of the war. The Russian navy practically ceases
to exist as a fighting force. Naval fight off Chemulpho.
Russia definitely ceases to exist as a naval power.
February 10.-Japan virtually obtains command of the seas.
March 9.--Russian destroyer sunk. Russian navy ceases
to exist as a fighting force.
April 13.--Petropavlovsk sunk by a mine, and may be
regarded as out of action for the rest of the war. Japan
obtains command of the seas.
April 25.— Vladivostok squadron suddenly appears and

CONSOLATION.
Young man, you have a wild and wintry air;
Strange moods of silence (tempered by profanity)
Drive you aloof; your eyes emit a glare
As of insanity;
Last night you groaned till nearly four o'clock;
To-day you have not shaved; you did not eat your
Herrings; young man, you must have had the knock
From some fair creature.
Well, it's a thing we all of us go through.
These trivial hurts have driven most men frantic
More or less regularly-I, like you,
Am inost romantic.
But be consoled. The wound is quick to heal.
Before another month has rolled behind you
You 'll be surprised to find how glad you feel
That She declined you.
(Ah, but you say, your love must needs endure :
Time could not make your ardent fires wax colder!
Couldn't he, though, my friend? You wait, till you 're
A little older!)
Marriage is no light matter. Once it's done,
It's done for good and all; if things miscarry,
There's no way out of it--and that, my son,
Would Le Old Harry
Just for the sake of argument, assume
That, having donned the matrimonial fetter,
You came across another maiden, whom
You liked much better.
(Never, you cry! CLRinda stands alone,
Peerless in charm, unrivalled in her graces !
Yes, we have all said that, but I have known
Some painful cases.)
Think, too, how surely up the female sleeve
There ever lurks that universal dagger,
Which makes each daughter of her mother, Eve,
A latent Nagger!
Potential, maybe ; but one never knows !
E’en this fair thing, with whom you strove to pair off
So wildly and so vainly, if she chose,
('ould nag your hair off.
Young man, there be two teachings of the Wise,
Potent to soothe the pangs of disappointment: -
“Brevity is the Soul of Love”- and “Flies
Can spoil the Ointment."
"Tis not in mortals to command success;
And, if you come to look at matters coolly,
It's just as well; so you need not distress
Yourself unduly.

THE TUCKSHOP.
[Canon EDWARD LYTTELTON, the future head-

“tuck-shop." It taught boys, he said, to some
slight extent how to spend money.]
Long its worth was held in question,
Long the sad, alarming state
Of the national digestion
Stood against it on the slate;
Now, a sage's dictum hushes
Lies that base tradition told ;
Whitewashed by his generous brush is
Every shop where “tuck” is sold !
Falsely would Roast Beef take credit
For the strength of Albion's sons;
No! The mystic germ that fed it
Hides in Bath and Chelsea buns !
Youthful souls are fired and mettled
In the venerable shop;
Waterloos are fought and settled
By the virile ginger-pop !
Then again-oh cynic, scorning
This encomium-answer me!
Who can tell but every morning
Youths predestined soon to be
Chancellors of the Exchequer,
Members of the Board of Trade,
Haggle o'er a modest “ brekker”
In the tuckshop's steaming shade?
So this institution's gentle
Influence, and wholesome joys,

[Being a summary of Lord AVEBURY's fasci-

presentation of prizes to the Carpenters'
and Joiners' Exhibition.]
The life of a tree, Lord AVEBURY began,
was often compared to that of a man,
not always to the advantage of the latter.
A hundred years was a life-indeed, a
long life for a man--seldom reached and
scarcely ever exceeded. It was nothing
for a tree, combining with the strength
of age the spring and elasticity of youth.

Into our houses it brought the sunshine

with the sweet scent of innumerable
flowers, the freshness of mountain air;
it seemed to combine the charms and

summer and the bracing cold of winter.

TT was during an idle summer walk amid the pines and heather of a Surrey hill that Mr. Punch, on one hot day of this
I very month of June, found himself suddenly and unexpectedly at the white gate of a spacious enclosure in the midst
of which he observed an extensive bungalow and a number of young men in strange garb-hatless, collarless, sockless, and
{andalled-going through what seemed to be organised although fantastic evolutions.
One of them, catching sight of the Sage and instantly recognising the unexpected but always welcome figure, cane
quickly to bid him enter, and Mr. Punch forthwith did so, and was for the first time in his life within the portals of the
new Utopian College for the Promotion of National Efficiency. Entering the central hall of the College, MR. PUNCH noted
the austere simplicity of its decorations. There were no chairs or carpets, but the walls were hung with portraits of
various hierophants of the Simple Life, amongst whom he recognised the ascetic lineaments of Mr. ARNOLD WHITE,
Lord ROSEBERY, Cato, President RcOSEVELT and the Hon. C. R. SPENCER. In the corner was one of the Professors in the
undress uniform of a Samurai preparing China tea in a buge Samovar. After a brief inspection of the class-rooms,
laboratories and kitchen, over the door of which was inscribed the legend, “All meat abandon, ye who enter here,”
Mr. Punch passed out again by the main entrance and surveyed the pupils still engaged with stoical persistence in the
mysterious evolutions which had already excited his surprise.
"And so it is in these playing fields,” the Sage remarked pleasantly, “ that the battles of the future are to be won ?”
The young man looked at him with sorrow mingled with perplexity. “We have no playing fields," he said. “The
very term strikes at the root of our scheme. A field, as we understand it, is a tract of land intended for toil and tillage."
“Then you don't play cricket?” Mr. Punch replied.
“Oh, no,” said his companion. “Professor Begbie is opposed to it. But,” he added eagerly, noting that the face of
his companion darkened, “we skip quite a lot half an hour every morning-and we have the most charming scientific
breathing exercises."...
“Indeed,” said the Sage; "and do you bathe?”
“Very seldom. Since the condemnation of Shower Baths by the Dean of Canterbury our code of ablutions has
been revised.”
“And have you any indoor recreations? You read novels, I suppose ?”.
“Novels," said the young man firmly, “are forbidden, as tending to impair the moral fibre and interfere with that
control of nature which has recently and wisely been said to be man's destiny and his greatest need."
“I see,” said Mr. PUNCH,“that I am touching on painful subjects. Permit me to apologise and to request you
to instruct me upon the more serious side of your life in this strenuous Utopia."

PUNCH, OR TIIE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“Our curriculum of studies,” the young man began with obvious pleasure, “has been arranged by one of the greatest
and weightiest of modern scientists, Professor Ray LANKESTER. The time-table is as follows:- From 7 to 8 Geology ;
from 10 to 12 Physics; from 3 to 4 Chemistry, and from 8 to 10 Biology--thus placing in our hands the four passports to
that control of nature which is man's destiny and his greatest need.”
Mr. PUNCH experiencing and displaying suitable emotions, the spritely Utopian proceeded :-“Professor RAY
LANKESTER is, however, only one of the Board of Control. The Chairman is of course Professor WELLS, who called the
College into being. Among his colleagues are Professor EUSTACE MILES, Professor BEGBIE, Dr. HAIG, Mrs. EARLE and
Baron SUYEMATSI. The last-named pioneer of civilisation has recently introduced bracken into the commissariat
department; and we shall take it as a bigh compliment, Sir, if you will join us at a bracken lunch to-day. I might
explain, however, that our meals are silent, since we make a point of chewing every mouthful thirty-three times, and it has
been noticed that if one talks one is liable to lose count."
Mn. Punch politely excused himself, but expressed a wish to hear more. “Do you," he asked, "resort to Japan
for any other customs ? "
"Oh yes," said his companion, “we take advantage of advanced civilisation wherever we find it. Our conduct,
for example, is regulated by the Code of Bushido, and our physical culture is based on the principles of Ju-jitsu. We
sleep in the open air on wooden pillows, like the Japanese, and we abstain froin cigarettes, like the Esquimaux. In
short, our one aim is to allow nothing to prejudice our control of nature, which is, as you may not perhaps know, at once
man's destiny and his greatest need.
“But do reconsider your decision, Sir," le added, “and join us over our bracken and China tea."
"No," said Mr. Punch, “I must le going. I have stayed long enough. But lefore I go let me say that you seem

should not cause us to run to such extremes as you have described to me. To acclimatise exotic habits and encourage
anti-social ones can never lead to an efficiency worth the name.
“Be English." the Sage continued. " but be sensible. Eat well and drink well; work well and play well : burn
your skipping-ropes and throw away your bracken ; talk over your meals and sleep in beds; read good stories and forget
scientific catchwords. Above all, don't be prigs.

and educational faddism, and the best guide to a reasonable English efficiency in the world, and also the very safest
preventive of taking oneself too seriously ------"
